  "text": "<p>\u201cKneel.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The wind was bitterly cold, and Wei Wuxian was in nothing but his ancient leathers. Around him, the Lan were in cloaks of deep white and blue, lined with fur. The moonlight lent their impassive faces a strange, cruel glow as they watched him stumble, panting, blood trailing sticky and hot down from the wound in his abdomen to the snow-covered ground.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cFuck you,\u201d Wei Wuxian said pleasantly. \u201cAnd you know what? Fuck your mothers too. And your fathers. I\u2019m not picky.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cJust give him to us, Hanguang Jun,\u201d a voice said from behind Wei Wuxian. One of the Jin, he was sure. There was no mistaking that haughty tone. \u201cOur young lord wants him.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWith all due respect,\u201d one of the Lans said, \u201cthis is <em>our</em> lord\u2019s land. Honoured brother Jin, you are trespassing-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re retrieving a <em>traitor</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201c-a slight our lord is graciously choosing to forgive.\u201d The Lan boy\u2019s face remained cold, his tone polite. He wasn\u2019t saying <em>fuck you</em>, but Wei Wuxian was pretty sure it was implied. \u201cBut Wei Wuxian is upon Hanguang Jun\u2019s land now, honoured brother, and his fate now lies in our lord\u2019s hands.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Their lord stepped forward.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The Lans were all shining and strange, more beings of ice than men, but not a single one of them shone as brightly as their lord. He strode forward, his cloak a whisper of noise against the snow, his black hair glittering with frost.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cKneel,\u201d said Hanguang Jun. His voice was deep.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, I\u2019d love to,\u201d Wei Wuxian said, aiming for a purr \u2013 that was promptly ruined by the way his teeth were chattering. \u201cBut as much as I\u2019d love to be executed by you \u2013 really, I\u2019d just love it \u2013 I need to get going. Things to do, you know.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Perhaps the blood loss was making his reflexes slow, because he didn\u2019t see the moment Hanguang Jun crossed the snow and took hold of him. He felt lean, strong fingers close in his hair. Felt the barest press of nails against his scalp, a touch that made sparks of sensation fly through him, and felt his head wrench back.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He was forced down to his knees with a yelp.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou were defeated upon my land, Wei Wuxian,\u201d said Hanguang Jun. \u201cAccording to the laws of the empire, I have the right to claim one of your household as my own.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian laughed shakily.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid I\u2019m a disowned, orphaned traitor, my lord,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t have a bride to offer you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou have yourself,\u201d said Hanguang Jun.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian suddenly felt very, very lightheaded.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Oh.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWarlord Lan,\u201d one of the Jin said, horrified. \u201cWhat can you want with him? Wei Wuxian is a \u2013 is a\u2026.\u201d He choked for a moment, and Wei Wuxian wondered through the sheer panicked hum of his own mind struggling to catch up with what the <em>hell</em> was happening, whether he\u2019d say <em>traitor</em> or <em>man</em> or just <em>horrible nuisance that you\u2019ll stab within a week because he never shuts up</em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2026man.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Well. That answered that.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThe law allows for it,\u201d said Hanguang Jun. He did not seem inclined to say anything else. His gaze was still fixed on Wei Wuxian\u2019s face. With a firm but not unkind hand, he moved Wei Wuxian\u2019s head, left then right, slowly inspecting his features with cold, unreadable eyes.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>There was a cough from the Jin. A shuffle of feet.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOur young lord will want to witness the marriage,\u201d one of the Jin blustered, after a beat of flustered silence. \u201cHe will need an assurance that you do not seek to assist this traitor to escape our righteous justice.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWould you question our lord\u2019s honour after his generosity in allowing you to live <em>despite </em>your trespass?\u201d the Lan boy shot back.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Hanguang Jun raised one elegant hand.\u00a0 Behind him, the Lan boy fell obediently silent.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThis lord does not seek to aid a traitor,\u201d said Hanguang Jun. He sounded contemptuous. Bored. \u201cThis lord merely seeks to claim his rights. Wei Wuxian is pleasing to look upon, and I would have him.\u201d His gaze ticked up, glacial cold. \u201cEmperor Jin is familiar with the concept.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian nearly laughed, but managed to restrain himself. Still, he jerked a little, and felt Hanguang Jun\u2019s grip tighten in response.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><em>Emperor Jin is familiar with the concept</em>. That was putting it mildly. Jin Guangshan had, at minimum, hundreds of minor wives claimed in battle, locked away in his palace. He was a letch and a monster, but ah \u2013 that was <em>fine</em>, wasn\u2019t it? <em>Lawful. </em>And how could a thing done lawfully be wrong?</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>As if powerful men were not the ones who wrote the empire\u2019s laws. As if Hanguang Jun didn\u2019t hold all the power here, while Wei Wuxian had none.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cForgive us, Hanguang Jun,\u201d another Jin said. This one spoke more softly, his voice deferential and elegant. \u201cHanguang Jun has not previously expressed his \u2013 interest \u2013 in the spoils of war. We were taken by surprise.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Hanguang Jun made a noise of acknowledgement.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYour lord may attend the ceremony,\u201d he said. And then he released Wei Wuxian, turning calmly away.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>And Wei Wuxian \u2013 with the kind of suicidal impulse his brother had always yelled at him for \u2013 tipped forward and grabbed the lord\u2019s cloak. He didn\u2019t know what he was hoping to accomplish, and by the time his brain began screaming warnings at him \u2013 all of them in Jiang Cheng\u2019s voice, no surprise there \u2013 his bloody hand was already closed on cloth.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The lord froze. Looked down.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian released him with an awkward laugh he couldn\u2019t quite hold back. Hanguang Jun\u2019s eyes narrowed. He kept on walking.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The bloodstain on his cloak was a deep, furious red against white.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAllow me to see to your wound, Wei Wuxian,\u201d said one of the Lan, leaning down before him.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\u00a0</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\u201cRight,\u201d Wei Wuxian said shakily. \u201cYes.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>-</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>His sword was taken, and his favourite dagger removed from his boot. He was given a blanket and a fresh bandage for his abdomen, and some kind of medicine that made his head feel cloudy. (He\u2019d tried to refuse that, but the Lan were all singularly terrifying, and he hadn\u2019t been able to disobey in the face of the flat, cold stare that had been turned on him.) Then he was led to a horse-</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>-and hoisted up in front of Hanguang Jun.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He made a strangled sound as he felt large hands close on his waist, lifting him as if he were some delicate waif instead of the full-grown, battle-hardened man that he was.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDid I hurt you?\u201d Hanguang Jun\u2019s voice. Wei Wuxian couldn\u2019t see his face from this angle; only feel the warmth of his body, and the brush of his heavy cloak against Wei Wuxian\u2019s back.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cN- no.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji said nothing. The horses began to move.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian turned his head a little, craning to see the Jin at the back of the Lan contingent. He felt a hand tighten at his waist.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cStay still,\u201d said Hanguang Jun.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The breath caught, briefly, in Wei Wuxian\u2019s throat.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat do you want me for, my lord?\u201d He kept his voice low. No need to draw attention.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI have explained.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI heard. You think I\u2019m \u2013 <em>pleasing to look upon</em>,\u201d Wei Wuxian felt a smile twist his mouth at the ridiculousness of that idea. He wasn\u2019t a naturally ugly man, sure, but it had been months since he\u2019d last had a good meal or, hells, a proper bath. He knew how he looked. \u201cBut Hanguang Jun is a handsome man. And even if he were not \u2013 Hanguang Jun is a <em>rich </em>man. He doesn\u2019t need to pluck up someone like me for his bed. So what does this lord want with me?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The wind howled, a faint whistle of noise through the pale mountain trees.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou were once a brother to Sandu Shengshou,\u201d said Hanguang Jun, eventually.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou won\u2019t get anything from him for me,\u201d said Wei Wuxian. \u201cI told you, my lord. I have no family. I was disowned.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOn what basis?\u201d He could feel the murmur of the lord\u2019s voice against his hair. Soft. Hanguang Jun\u2019s thighs were warm against his own; his skin hot, where it pressed against Wei Wuxian\u2019s own, through layers and layers of clothes, in sharp contrast to the chill of the night air.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI committed a dishonourable murder,\u201d Wei Wuxian said, throat strangely dry. <em>Focus.</em> \u201cBlackened my name. Broke imperial law. Jiang Cheng \u2013 <em>Sandu Shengshou</em> \u2013 couldn\u2019t allow me to stay, if he wanted to rule Jiang lands with the emperor\u2019s support. My name was erased from the Jiang family scrolls. They\u2019ll give you nothing for me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWho did you kill dishonourably?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He closed his eyes. The memory of Lotus Pier burning flickered through his mind. \u00a0He leaned back against Hanguang Jun, side aching. Even through the soft weight of the man\u2019s cloak, he could feel the rise and fall of his ribcage; the breadth of him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWen Chao,\u201d he said finally. \u201cWen Zhuliu. Wen Xu. I cut their throats in their sleep.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He\u2019d thought it a fairer death than they\u2019d deserved. A shame that that rules of honourable combat \u2013 <em>a just war demands a meeting of swords, at an agreed upon place; a just war cannot be a knife in the dark</em> - did not concur. \u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd how,\u201d Hanguang Jun asked, \u201cdid you come to anger Jin Zixun?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAh. I <em>didn\u2019t </em>commit dishonourable murders,\u201d he said, feeling the bitterness curl his mouth into an ugly smile. \u201cYou of all people should understand, Hanguang Jun, that there are things you can\u2019t do when you\u2019re a warlord under the Jin Emperor. You can\u2019t take land or hold it without proving your strength in battle. You must obey the rules of combat. You have to pay your taxes into Jin Guangshan\u2019s fat coffers. And you can\u2019t kill women and children who\u2019ve never held a sword. But you can ask a mercenary to do it. And if that mercenary says no\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian shrugged. Tried to look back at the lord. Could see nothing but that blood-stained cloak; the edge of his dark hair.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cBut you haven\u2019t answered <em>my</em> question,\u201d he went on. \u201cWhat do you want from me, my lord?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Silence.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><em>Shut up,</em> Jiang Cheng\u2019s voice said. <em>Shut up, Wei Wuxian, shut up-</em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cPerhaps you like men who\u2019re hurt,\u201d said Wei Wuxian, ignoring common sense. \u201cOr men who can\u2019t fight back. Is that it?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>If anything, Hanguang Jun\u2019s silence seemed to grow \u2013 colder. There was no sound but Wei Wuxian\u2019s own breath; the cry of the wind, and the clatter of hooves.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou can do what you like to me,\u201d Wei Wuxian said, suddenly tired. He\u2019d been running from the Jin for days on end. He couldn\u2019t go on much longer. \u201cWhatever it is. You\u2019re not bad looking Hanguang Jun, and I\u2026\u201d He swallowed. He didn\u2019t think saying, <em>I suppose I\u2019ll get enough food and a warm bed and maybe even a halfway decent fuck, which is more than I\u2019ve had in longer than I can remember, and that\u2019s not so bad</em>, would go down well. \u201c\u2026I don\u2019t mind.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWen Xu,\u201d Hanguang Jun said abruptly.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian blinked.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat about him?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhen I was a boy, Wen Xu broke my leg,\u201d said Hanguang Jun. \u201cMurdered my father. You killed him. I owe you a debt.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSo,\u201d Wei Wuxian managed, after a moment. \u201cYou knew everything about me already. That makes sense. I knew you didn\u2019t want me for my pretty face.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIt is unwise to anger the Jin,\u201d Hanguang Jun went on, ignoring that comment. \u201cJin Zixun has the emperor\u2019s support. He will kill you with impunity. Marry me and you will live.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em>If it\u2019s unwise to anger the Jin, why are you claiming me? </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>But Wei Wuxian didn\u2019t ask. He wasn\u2019t quite that stupid. He wanted to live. He wanted it very, very much.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Somewhere, the Wen Remnants were waiting for him. He couldn\u2019t let them down.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAh, Hanguang Jun,\u201d he said instead, laughingly shakily. \u201cHow noble of you. How can I refuse?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou were not asked,\u201d Hanguang Jun said. And there was something dark in his voice that made Wei Wuxian shiver despite himself, shifting uneasily. Hanguang Jun's hand pressed to his uninjured side. The lightest, faintest hint of fingers.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cStop moving,\u201d the lord said. \u201cYou will reopen your wound.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian swallowed. \u201cAs Hanguang Jun says.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>After that, they rode in silence.</p>\n<p>Hanguang Jun\u2019s fortress was known as the Silent Fort, and it lived up to its name. Within its walls, the Lan moved as silently as they had on the mountains. The wind struck chimes hung from windows and doorways, allowing the faintest echo of music to shimmer through the halls. But the people were quiet. Their eyes on their guests \u2013 and on Wei Wuxian \u2013 were guarded. Cold.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Only the Jin talked. Muttering to themselves. Grumbling. Jin Zixun was hissing something under his breath to one of his men, a doe-eyed youth in plain robes, who nodded obediently and placated him with gentle words. Wei Wuxian was maybe <em>slightly</em> pleased to see that Jin Zixun\u2019s clothing was scuffed, his hair askew, a streak of dirt on his face. He\u2019d been chasing Wei Wuxian for as long as Wei Wuxian had been running, and he didn\u2019t look like a pretty Jin peacock any longer. He was probably angry with Wei Wuxian for that, too.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Oh, this was going to be a fun wedding.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>As Wei Wuxian followed Hanguang Jun, he tried to recall what he\u2019d learned about the Lans, when he\u2019d still been a Jiang clan member. He remembered frustratingly little. In the peaceful days before the Wen warlords had invaded Jiang territory and killed Jiang Fengmian and Yu Ziyuan, Wei Wuxian hadn\u2019t had much interest in politics and other families.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He\u2019d learned fast, after Lotus Pier burned. When he\u2019d decided to do anything \u2013 absolutely <em>anything</em> \u2013 to ensure Jiang Cheng took back control of Yunmeng.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He knew Imperial Lan territory was divided into two halves. The ancestral home and the surrounding quiet mountains and lush valleys were under the purview of Zewu Jun, but the arid borders had been claimed by Hanguang Jun. Traditionally, siblings were not inclined to divide territory, and competing land claims always ended in blood. But the Lan were a strange group by any measure, disinclined to displays of wealth or power, but viciously territorial and bloodthirsty when their land claims were challenged and in the defence of family. They rarely took multiple wives. Other lords liked to joke that they lived like monks: never drinking, never eating meat. Only fucking to keep the family line going, and even then only reluctantly.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Well. Wei Wuxian's current fate was proof that one of those things wasn't true.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThe ceremony will be before dawn,\u201d one Lan announced. A woman this time. She bowed her head to the Jin, her expression remote. \u201cIf our honoured brothers will follow me, you will be given rooms in which to rest before the ceremony.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Hanguang Jun looked at Wei Wuxian \u2013 one dark, steady look \u2013 and then he was gone too. A Lan servant beckoned Wei Wuxian over, leading him in the opposite direction.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He was taken to a room with a full tub of water and a waiting healer. Wei Wuxian was checked over once more by the healer. Given the opportunity for a hot bath, and a little food.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNot too much,\u201d the healer said. \u201cEat slowly. You\u2019ll grow ill, after going without so long.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>She gave his bare, bandaged torso a not particularly flattering once over, and left him to wash.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He would have enjoyed the food and the bath if he hadn\u2019t, oh \u2013 been getting <em>married</em> in a few hours. Instead he was a jittery mess. He gave his hair a perfunctory wash. Scrubbed himself clean, and chewed his way numbly through the food, before dragging on the layers of robes that had been left out for him. The clothes were, thankfully, not the kind of garb a woman would usually wear. Instead the outer robe was a heavy thing in Lan colours, whites and blues, lined with fur to keep out the winter chill. On his skin, it was soft enough not to jostle his wound at all.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Someone rapped their knuckles against the door. Pushed it open.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s time,\u201d said the Lan. And why did Wei Wuxian feel like he was being led to his execution, instead of being saved from it?</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>-</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>If this had been a proper wedding, he would have worn red. There would have been family. A feast. But a bride taken by war wasn\u2019t owed an honourable marriage, and what he was given \u2013 an imperial contract, a meal with an icy wall of Lan clan members and a glowering group of Jin, led by Jin Zixun who was pointedly holding his blade on his knees before him \u2013 was more than Wei Wuxian even wanted to deal with.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Hanguang Jun wore the same bloodied cloak he had when he\u2019d claimed Wei Wuxian. But his black hair had been combed to a shine. Above the white ribbon bound around his forehead, he had placed a silver pin, shaped to resemble frost, in his hair. No red for him, either, except for the red that Wei Wuxian had given him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The Lan were known across the empire for their coldness and their restraint, but Wei Wuxian was pretty sure that the way they were looking at the Jin was icy even by their standards. Still, they were scrupulously courteous, obeying imperial laws of hospitality, offering Jin Zixun and his men alcohol (which the Lan <em>didn\u2019t drink</em>, and wasn\u2019t that typical of Wei Wuxian\u2019s shitty luck), a fine array of food, and seats of honour at the ceremony itself.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jin Zixun drank steadily and stared at Wei Wuxian with ugly, furious eyes.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><em>You can\u2019t kill me now</em>, Wei Wuxian gloated internally, and even offered Jin Zixun a brief flash of a grin. The man\u2019s right eye visibly twitched in response.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The wedding itself was a blur. The Jin contingent grew steadily drunker and ruder \u2013 a slight that the Lan were forced to cope with, out of courtesy and a need to offend the emperor\u2019s own blood - but at the end of it, Hanguang Jun said, \u201cCome.\u201d And Wei Wuxian followed as he was led from the feasting hall. Led to his wedding night.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>-</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>And then they were alone. The bed was\u2026 big.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian sucked in a steadying breath. He was no wilting maiden. For one he wasn\u2019t a <em>maiden</em> \u2013 he was a man, even if the imperial contract had named him Hanguang Jun\u2019s bride, right there in dark indelible ink \u2013 and for another, he wasn\u2019t afraid of sex. He\u2019d missed it, actually. And he hadn\u2019t lied, when he\u2019d called Hanguang Jun handsome. He could make it through this.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He reached for the sash of his robes, beginning to remove the outer robe with deft tugs of his hands. With a jolt of surprise, he felt Hanguang Jun\u2019s hands on his waist, drawing him closer and\u2026. tying the robe back in place.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s normal to take off your clothes on your wedding night,\u201d Wei Wuxian pointed out, with a lot more confidence than he felt. Hanguang Jun\u2019s hands were big, with graceful fingers that drew the robe closed a shade too tightly. Wei Wuxian could feel the movement of his fingertips, the passing brush of his knuckles, like small points of warmth that burrowed through his clothing straight down to the skin beneath. \u201cBut if this lord would like to take his \u2013 his <em>bride</em> \u2013 fully clothed then \u2013\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI am not touching you,\u201d Hanguang Jun said in a low voice. \u201cI told you. I owe you a debt. You do not owe me \u2013 congress.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cBut you are touching me,\u201d Wei Wuxian pointed out, and gave a wriggle for emphasis. Hanguang Jun\u2019s hands tightened on his waist, and Wei Wuxian\u2019s breath stuttered. Hanguang Jun immediately softened his grip, his fingers fanning out against Wei Wuxian\u2019s sides, his thumbs brushing a feather-light arc against Wei Wuxian\u2019s hipbones.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYour wound,\u201d said Hanguang Jun.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re not hurting me,\u201d Wei Wuxian said tightly. As if he had the mental capacity to feel <em>pain</em>, when his pulse was thundering in his ears, and he could feel the much more interesting weight of Hanguang Jun\u2019s warm hands and warmer breath. Hanguang Jun had a very soft looking mouth, for a warlord. Graceful eyelashes.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>There was a faint noise. The flicker of a candle beyond the door which was\u2026 slightly ajar.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>They were almost the same height. If Wei Wuxian turned his head, just so, their mouths would touch.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Instead he touched his mouth to Hanguang Jun\u2019s ear. Said, in a voice that was barely breath, \u201cSomeone is watching us. From the door.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI know,\u201d Hanguang Jun murmured in return.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd\u2026?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Hanguang Jun seemed to \u2013 struggle. For a moment. Then he leaned in closer, his breath tracing Wei Wuxian\u2019s jaw. Said against his ear, \u201cIt would be better to ensure any spies have no \u2013 doubts.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Ah. Politics.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>If Jin Zixun could claim the marriage was unconsummated, that Hanguang Jun was harbouring a rebel rather than a bride, then Wei Wuxian would be fucked in a very different way than he\u2019d expected to be on his wedding night, and Hanguang Jun and his clan along with him. The emperor wasn\u2019t merciful to those who defied his laws. Wei Wuxian knew that very well.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><em>Fucking Jin</em>, thought Wei Wuxian. Ah, Jin Zixun was determined to see him dead, wasn\u2019t he? All because Wei Wuxian hadn\u2019t wanted to help him commit genocide. A true credit to the imperial family, was Jin Zixun.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cCome with me to bed, my lord,\u201d Wei Wuxian said. He didn\u2019t say it loudly, exactly \u2013 but he didn\u2019t whisper it either.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI won\u2019t touch you,\u201d Hanguang Jun insisted, keeping his voice soft so that their spy \u2013 or was it spies? \u2013 could not hear them.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t see how you can avoid it,\u201d Wei Wuxian answered, dragging Hanguang Jun back onto the bed with him. He fell back against it, flat on the sheets, Hanguang Jun\u2019s hands releasing him as he sprawled out.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He received his answer almost immediately. Hanguang Jun reached up. Pulled a cord. Gauze fell, rippling and falling still, surrounding the bed in a dark haze.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI appreciate privacy,\u201d said the lord, when Wei Wuxian blinked at him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI can see that,\u201d said Wei Wuxian, trying not to sound <em>too</em> appreciative. \u201cBut our shadows are still visible.\u201d He rose up onto his elbows. Ignored the twinge in his side. \u201cYou\u2019ll have to do <em>something</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Hanguang Jun watched Wei Wuxian with cold, careful eyes. Then, with slow, avoidable motions he crouched over Wei Wuxian\u2019s body. He lay his palms flat by Wei Wuxian\u2019s head, his black hair surrounding them both in a dark veil. He legs nudged between Wei Wuxian\u2019s own, parting them just enough for Hanguang Jun to balance between them, his robes brushing Wei Wuxian\u2019s own modestly clothed thighs.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian supposed, from a distance, it would possibly look like they were having some truly terrible sex. Maybe.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cA little movement would be more convincing,\u201d Wei Wuxian whispered, and to his delight, watched the warlord\u2019s ears darken with a blush. Suddenly, some of the fear he could barely acknowledge eased.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI am not truly lying with you,\u201d he gritted out.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cCongress. Touching. Lying.\u201d Wei Wuxian\u2019s mouth curled into a smile. Like the fool with a death wish that he was, he reached his hands up and\u2026 touched Hanguang Jun\u2019s hair. \u201cYou can call it <em>fucking</em>, my lord. I won\u2019t mind.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Hanguang Jun\u2019s jaw tightened. Without warning, he took Wei Wuxian by the wrists and pinned his hands flat against the bed.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian let out a surprised noise that turned into a moan. And then into a louder moan, as he decided that if he had to embarrass himself, he could at least put his shame to good use.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cMy lord,\u201d he gasped out, throwing his head back, spreading his legs out across the bed and drawing up his knees. He dug his heels into the bed, drawing them back and forth in a movement that hopefully said, <em>I\u2019m definitely being fucked</em>, to anyone watching from a distance.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>For a delightful moment, Hanguang Jun looked like he\u2019d been beaten over the head with something heavy. Then his expression sharpened and he said, \u201cLan Zhan.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian stopped his theatrics long enough to say, \u201cWhat?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIf I were\u2026\u201d His voice faded. Then firmed. \u201cMy courtesy name is Lan Wangji. But you would call me Lan Zhan.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><em>If I were fucking you</em>. He hadn\u2019t said it and yet it <em>felt</em> like he\u2019d said it. Wei Wuxian realised, that he was hot all over, burning up as if he really had been writhing in bed out of pleasure. And yes, of course \u2013 he was hard. Achingly.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He was suddenly glad that he hadn\u2019t actually managed to remove his clothes.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cLan Zhan,\u201d he gasped out, with a whine that should have sounded false and <em>was</em> false but also made Hanguang Jun\u2019s eyes darken and Wei Wuxian curl his toes against the bedding in a way that was a little too damn real for comfort. \u201cLan Zhan, <em>please</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Hanguang Jun \u2013 Lan Wangji \u2013 shifted above him. Shifted once more. Wei Wuxian wondered how that looked from a distance, because to Wei Wuxian it looked\u2026 pretty great.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cMake noise,\u201d hissed Wei Wuxian.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI am not loud,\u201d Lan Wangji replied.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThen it\u2019s lucky this isn\u2019t real, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Wei Wuxian said, more sharply than he should have. He winced. \u201cSorry. That was-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cGood,\u201d Lan Wangji said. His voice was deep, no longer a whisper. A little husky. And pleased. Something for show. \u201cGood, Wei Wuxian.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian swallowed. Said, \u201cCall me Wei Ying.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWei Ying,\u201d he repeated. He released Wei Wuxian\u2019s wrists \u2013 brushed his thumbs over them, once, in a gentle apology. He wasn\u2019t touching Wei Wuxian at all now, with anything but his robes, the accidental brush of hair. \u201cWei Ying is so good to his lord.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian did his best not to whimper.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Instead, he panted, knocked his hands hard against the bed \u2013 and truly, fucking was ridiculous, when you had to think about it \u2013 and then let out a high gasp that he hoped sounded like he\u2019d come.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji rolled off him. Lay flat against the bed, as Wei Wuxian sat up, still breathing heavily. He couldn\u2019t hear anything. The door, half visible through the gauze, was still slightly ajar, but Wei Wuxian felt fairly sure their watcher was gone.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you think\u2026?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSleep,\u201d said Hanguang Jun. His voice brooked no argument. \u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cBut-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWei Wuxian. Enough.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian lay back down. A few minutes later, he heard the lord\u2019s breath grow even.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Had the man <em>actually</em> fallen asleep?</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He sat up once more and looked over at Hanguang Jun. The man\u2019s eyes were closed. His breathing was still even, deep.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian allowed him one moment to marvel at the fact that this man had saved his life. Had still <em>not</em> fucked him. Had fallen asleep next to Wei Wuxian \u2013 a man who had killed multiple warlords in their beds \u2013 without a single second of hesitation.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He loosened his own robes. Bit down on his lip. Very carefully scraped his own nails against his throat. His collarbones. He repeated the movements until he was sure he\u2019d left marks.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian looked down at his own wrists then, where the faint pressure marks of Lan Wangji\u2019s grip were already fading. With a faint sigh, he brought the first wrist up to his mouth, set his teeth gently against it, and began to suck.</p>\n<p>It was almost morning when Wei Wuxian woke in a panic and thought, <em>what the hell am I doing here?</em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He held himself very, very still on the bed. His heart was thumping rabbit-fast in his chest. He could feel half-snippets of a dozen different memories clawing at his eyelids: Wen Qing sheathing her bloody sword to her side as she ran; Wen Ning tucked A-Yuan into his cloak; the Wen running for their lives, as Wei Wuxian turned, the sounds of the Jin horsemen drawing ever closer behind him-</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wen Qing saying, <em>Come and find us, Wei Wuxian, please. We\u2019ll be waiting there-</em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He needed to get out.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He slipped off of the bed. Walked slowly across the room, the faint light of the dawn all he had to guide him. Lan Wangji still lay asleep on the bed, the gold of morning washing over his face. He was unfairly handsome.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He\u2019d looked so good, holding himself over Wei Wuxian last night. It had made Wei Wuxian want things he shouldn\u2019t have.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian only went as far as the corridor outside the warlord\u2019s bedchamber. Leaned against the wall, sucking in desperate breaths. Shit, he was so tired. It was the kind of tiredness sleep couldn\u2019t fix. He felt like he hadn\u2019t rested since the day Lotus Pier burned. And he couldn\u2019t rest now \u2013 couldn\u2019t let himself. He still had work to do. Still had a promise to keep. And Hanguang Jun \u2013 Lan Wangji \u2013 was\u2026 well, he<em> seemed</em> honourable in a way that real people weren\u2019t, and he was powerful and fucking hot and he blushed so prettily, but he wasn\u2019t a fix for Wei Wuxian\u2019s problems.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji had said he owed Wei Wuxian a debt. But how far did a debt really stretch? How long before Lan Wangji decided Wei Wuxian was too much of a burden, and threw him back to the dogs?</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He raised a hand to his face, rubbing his eyes.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he whispered to himself. To the Wens, who were waiting for him, and would keep waiting for him, because Wei Wuxian was stuck here for a while yet. \u201cI\u2019m doing my best.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>You</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He was slammed back against the wall. In a blink, there was the point of a blade hovering at his throat.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Ah, fuck.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI knew you\u2019d try to escape,\u201d Jin Zixun said triumphantly. His breath stank of liquor. His eyes were bloodshot. Wei Wuxian was pretty sure he hadn\u2019t slept at all.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cLord Jin,\u201d Wei Wuxian said calmly, controlling his breath and raising his hands up against the wall, letting his mouth curl into an easy smile. \u201cI know you\u2019re not the smartest man, but do you think I\u2019d try and escape from the middle of a warlord\u2019s fortress in nothing but this?\u201d He gestured down at his inner robe with the crook of a finger. The robe only loosely bound, open enough to reveal his collarbones and a flash of his bare chest. \u201cI\u2019m only what I appear to be, my lord.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cA filthy mercenary who stole my kills?\u201d Jin Zixun sneered.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cA new bride, Lord Jin,\u201d Wei Wuxian said, batting his lashes. And then, because he loved fucking with Jin Zixun, he really did, he said, \u201cI came out here to get some air. I was quite <em>overwhelmed</em> by my wedding night.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jin Zixun bared his teeth.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cTell me,\u201d he gritted out, \u201cwhere they are.\u201d When Wei Wuxian blinked at him in fake confusion, he leaned forward, the tip of his blade perilously close to cutting skin. \u201cThat bitch Wen Qing, I\u2019m going to find her and I\u2019m going to kill her, I\u2019m going to kill all of them until every Wen is dead-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cMy lord!\u201d The doe-eyed Jin man who\u2019d stayed by Jin Zixun\u2019s side all through the feast raced down the corridor. \u201cMy lord, if you harm him, it will break imperial law, he is Hanguang Jun\u2019s <em>property</em>-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat does a dead whore cost anyway?\u201d Jin Zixun scoffed. \u201cA few horses? A pile of gold? If he wants another whore, I could just give <em>you</em> to him, Meng Yao.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThe cost of killing a man\u2019s claimed bride is the attacker\u2019s manhood,\u201d a voice said. Deep and calm. Lan Wangji emerged from the room, his appearance impeccable, his face entirely unfeeling. He held an unsheathed sword. \u201cLord Jin should be aware of his uncle\u2019s own laws.\u201d His gaze flickered, briefly, to Wei Wuxian\u2019s throat. \u201cAnd Lord Jin should unhand my wife, or I will be forced to remove his hand from his wrist.\u201d A beat. \u201cThat is the price of damage. Edict three hundred and eighty-seven.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Ah, had Wei Wuxian\u2019s husband swallowed the text of the imperial laws, to know them so well?</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cMy lord,\u201d the doe-eyed Meng Yao entreated.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jin Zixun\u2019s hand trembled.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cFine! Fine,\u201d snarled Jin Zixun. He lowered his blade. \u201cTake him.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jin Zixun stepped back, still vibrating with obvious rage.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou should not have left my bed, <em>wife</em>,\u201d Lan Wangji said viciously, grabbing Wei Wuxian by one wrist. Wei Wuxian stumbled forward against Lan Wangji, dragged by the implacable strength of that arm, and definitely, <em>definitely</em> didn\u2019t feel a black wave arousal crash through him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji\u2019s grip immediately loosened even as he held Wei Wuxian close, hip to chest, his thumb shaping an apology. And that was \u2013 good. And right. Because this was just for show. But for the moment \u2013 the very small moment he\u2019d believed Lan Wangji was angry \u2013 Wei Wuxian had\u2026 wanted.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He hadn\u2019t known he\u2026 liked that.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Distantly, he heard Jin Zixun swear out an oath, and Meng Yao say something hurriedly in return. The sound of footsteps. Some of the tension eased out of him. Well. That was done.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Then he heard a hiss escape Lan Wangji\u2019s teeth. He looked at Lan Wangji\u2019s face, and realised he was looking down at Wei Wuxian\u2019s wrist.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian\u2019s bruised, teeth-marked wrists.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji looked furious. He looked like he was seriously contemplating taking that sword and chasing after Jin Zixun and skewering him through. And Wei Wuxian<em> could</em> have explained what he\u2019d done but Jin Zixun was still terribly close and he couldn\u2019t risk it. At least, that\u2019s what he told himself.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t you recognise your own marks, my lord?\u201d Wei Wuxian asked quickly.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He touched his free wrist to his mouth, hoping Lan Wangji would understand what Wei Wuxian had done. Pressed his teeth to the skin.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>If anything, Lan Wangji\u2019s gaze seemed to darken. Then he let out a wordless noise and dragged Wei Wuxian back into the bedroom.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cStay here,\u201d he said roughly, then left, shutting the door with a pointed click behind him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>-</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jin Zixun and his men left an hour after dawn. The Lans watched them go from the walls of the fortress. Lan Wangji insisted on having Wei Wuxian stand at his side.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou cannot leave,\u201d Lan Wangji said. He was still watching the Jin leave, his eyes fixed on the distance. But he was definitely speaking to Wei Wuxian, because he was using that low, intimate tone he used when he wanted no one but Wei Wuxian to hear him. \u201cJin Zixun will discover it if you run,\u201d he said. \u201cThe emperor will come to know of it. Jin Guangshan will turn on my clan, and upon my brother also. You must stay.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian let out a shaky breath. He knew. But.</p>\n<p><br>\nThe Wens.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI thought you owed me a debt, Hanguang Jun,\u201d said Wei Wuxian.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Finally, Lan Wangji looked at him. He didn\u2019t say a word.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Under that gaze, Wei Wuxian felt like something that had been cut open, all its soft and ugly insides displayed. He had to look away.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhatever my lord husband says,\u201d he said eventually. \u201cBut ah, how will I entertain myself? Does my lord need his wife to manage the household accounts?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNo need.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cGood, I\u2019m terrible with money.\u201d Wei Wuxian tapped his lower lip thoughtfully. \u201cAh, perhaps you need your wife to serenade you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI play music,\u201d said Lan Wangji, which Wei Wuxian guessed was a <em>no</em>.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian played the <em>dizi</em>, but decided to say, \u201cI sound like a dying animal when I sing, so that\u2019s for the best.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji\u2019s mouth twitched. It wasn\u2019t clear if he was suppressing a smile or a scowl.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to be good company, my lord,\u201d Wei Wuxian continued, with obnoxious cheer. \u201cThe only things I like to do are drink and fight, and you Lan don\u2019t care for alcohol.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIt is forbidden,\u201d Lan Wangji agreed.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd a good bride doesn\u2019t go around brawling, I expect.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji looked at him. Moved to speak \u2013 and was promptly interrupted.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHanguang Jun,\u201d one servant said, approaching with a bow. \u201cYour brother has sent a missive. If you would\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d said Lan Wangji. He was still looking at Wei Wuxian. \u201cGo and rest,\u201d he ordered. Then he swept away, leaving Wei Wuxian to contemplate the dull, empty life that lay ahead of him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>-</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>When Wei Wuxian returned to their room, he found his sword on the bed.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>-</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian healed. That took time.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>But he also practiced his swordsmanship in a training yard at the centre of the fortress, shown to him by a helpful Lan girl who told him she\u2019d been asked to direct him by Hanguang Jun himself. He usually went in the afternoons, when the Lan were busy elsewhere \u2013 meditating or something equally as boring he assumed \u2013 but once he went early in the morning, and found a gaggle of Lan children learning their sword forms. He practically melted. All the Lans were dour and cold, but what made for terrifying adults made for <em>adorable</em> children. It didn\u2019t help that the children were clearly fascinated by him, watching him practice in his own corner with wide, curious eyes in chubby, solemn faces.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>After that, he made a point of going early in the morning, and in short order he was training the children in some of the simplest forms he\u2019d learned during his own childhood in Lotus Pier. Their tutor allowed it with only the mildest disapproval.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI can hardly you stop you,\u201d she said, when he made a token effort to gain her permission to teach some of the older ones how to properly grapple an opponent barehanded.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAh, you can try and stop me, I wouldn\u2019t mind,\u201d Wei Wuxian said cheerily, as he gathered up the practice swords \u2013 it didn\u2019t hurt to make himself useful, now and again. \u201cI\u2019m just a minor wife. You won\u2019t see me getting haughty just because of who I roll around with.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cLanguage,\u201d she said, but without any heat. She\u2019d already grown used to Wei Wuxian\u2019s ways. Then she looked him up and down and sniffed. He was reminded, with a pang, of Wen Qing. \u201cWe do not gossip here, Master Wei. But that is not how our lord refers to you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian looked at her.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat does he call me then?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWe Lan do not gossip,\u201d she said. And refused to say anything more. When Wei Wuxian pressed, she said, \u201cAsk Hanguang Jun, if you\u2019re so curious.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>That finally shut him up.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>-</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em>Ask Hanguang Jun. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>As if Wei Wuxian didn\u2019t spend every night lying next to him, as Lan Wangji slept liked the dead, thinking about all the things he wanted to ask Lan Wangji to do to him. Sweet things. Dark things, that made his insides burn and ache with want and shame.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji had been gone for two days, dealing with border skirmishes apparently, and Wei Wuxian had spent both nights alone fucking into his fist and biting down on his own sleeve to stop himself making any noise when he thought of Lan Wangji pinning his wrists or staring at him with dark, furious eyes. Or, hells, speaking to him in that low, intimate voice, telling Wei Wuxian to obey or else, that he was <em>good</em>, calling him his <em>wife</em>-</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian stepped into the bedroom, still sweaty from the training yard, sword at his side. And stopped.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>His husband was back.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji was sat upon the edge of the bed, removing a silver pin from his hair. His own sword was on his knees.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Without pausing to think, Wei Wuxian approached him. Lan Wangji looked up with those cold, careful eyes of his.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWei Ying,\u201d he acknowledged.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian did not know where exactly Lan Wangji had been, but the warlord smelled of mountain winds and sandalwood, and his sword was freshly oiled, newly cleaned to remove any trace of blood. Wei Wuxian knew better than most than there was nothing beautiful about killing. But something about the thought of those strong, pale arms swinging a blade\u2026</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>His throat felt dry. Skin hot.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He unsheathed his sword. Lan Wangji continued to stare at him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cTake the sword from me, my lord,\u201d said Wei Wuxian quietly.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji did not move.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Usually, when he decided to do something this monumentally stupid, he heard his brother\u2019s voice in his head. But right now Wei Wuxian could hear nothing but his own heartbeat. His own stupid want. He took a step closer.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cTake the sword from me, Lan Zhan,\u201d Wei Wuxian said, and saw the shudder that ran through the man at the sound of his own name. \u201cTake it from me. Show me that you can.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Something like understanding flickered through Lan Wangji\u2019s eyes. He placed his own sword to the side and stood in one elegant motion. He took the hilt of Wei Wuxian\u2019s sword. Wei Wuxian gripped on tighter.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Staring into Wei Wuxian\u2019s eyes, Lan Wangji slid his fingers up Wei Wuxian\u2019s hand \u2013 up over the grip of his fingers, the hollows of his knuckles, the fine bones of the back of his hand. His wrist. Ever so slowly he pressed his own fingers in. And in. The pressure built, until Wei Wuxian could feel jolts of pain up his arm, enough to make his eyes sting.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>His hand spasmed. His gaze was on Lan Wangji\u2019s when let out a gasp of pain, open-mouthed, and the sword clattered to the floor.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji\u2019s grip loosened. But Wei Wuxian was still gasping. The pain had melted into pure heat, melting through him, and it was \u2013 so good. So sweet. \u201cLan Zhan,\u201d he breathed, pleading. And then Lan Wangji was biting out a groan. Leaning in.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kissing him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It was a filthy kiss. Wet, open-mouthed, their tongues meeting in a way that made Wei Wuxian shudder all over and press against Lan Wangji, trying to fit their bodies together with a hunger that came over him with terrifying strength. Lan Wangji deepened the kiss, taking Wei Wuxian\u2019s mouth with a pressure that was bruising and Wei Wuxian gripped onto him with a fist in that beautiful white robe, his sword hand lax and aching at his side.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIf I had really taken you to bed on our wedding night,\u201d Lan Wangji said roughly, pulling back for air, \u201cI would have marked you here.\u201d His mouth traced a line along Wei Wuxian\u2019s jaw, down to his throat. Wei Wuxian tipped his head back automatically, giving Lan Wangji room to breathe soft against the tendons of his throat. \u201cYour neck. Your thighs. I would have used my teeth. Made you beg.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>There was nothing Wei Wuxian wanted more, had ever wanted more, than for Lan Wangji to set his teeth against that skin and <em>bite</em>. He wanted Lan Wangji to make him cry. He wanted -</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWei Ying,\u201d murmured Lan Wangji. \u201cAsk me for what you want. You must ask.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji lifted his head, his lips red, his eyes hungry. But he was still. Waiting for something. For Wei Wuxian to speak.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><em>Do it</em>, Wei Wuxian wanted to say. <em>Take me, bite me, mark me.</em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>But he didn\u2019t. He knew what he wanted \u2013 what he really wanted \u2013 and he wasn\u2019t brave enough to put it into words. The words were stuck in his throat. He\u2019d thought for so long of asking Lan Wangji for things, so many things, but now they were both here he didn\u2019t know <em>how.</em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He said nothing for a long time. Far too long. And Lan Wangji released a breath. Drew back. His expression was unreadable.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI will sleep elsewhere tonight,\u201d Lan Wangji said quietly. And then he was gone.</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian walked the walls of the fortress. The Lan left him alone, which was good, because Wei Wuxian was in the mood to sulk extravagantly.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He should have said something. Anything.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He swung a foot out, kicking a loose piece of stone. Someone would have to tell Lan Wangji the walls needed better upkeep. Not Wei Wuxian though. Wei Wuxian could never talk to Lan Wangji again, because he only wanted to say one thing to Lan Wangji and for some reason he <em>couldn\u2019t say it</em>.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>No. That was a lie. He\u2019d known exactly why he couldn\u2019t say it. But that made the wanting no easier. It didn\u2019t make the way Lan Wangji had let go of him, walked away from him, any easier either.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Something dark moved overhead. Wei Wuxian looked up.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The Wen clan had once bred birds to carry messages for them.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>They\u2019d kept the breeding and training of those birds a complete secret because of the unusual skill their messenger birds possessed: when those birds reached their destination, they would only land and give up their message to a person who knew the distinct call they\u2019d been trained to obey.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wen Chao had used dark, ostentatious hawks, tasselled with gold. Wei Wuxian knew, because he\u2019d shot Wen Chao\u2019s favourite from the sky himself. But Wen Qing was cleverer than her dead, distant cousins. The bird Wei Wuxian saw circling overhead was unremarkable, apart from the red cloth bound around one of its feet. Wei Wuxian\u2019s breath hitched.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He\u2019d tied that to A-Yuan\u2019s wrist himself. <em>See, I\u2019ll still be with you A-Yuan! I\u2019ll come back, I promise. You don\u2019t need to cry. Let your uncle hold you, it\u2019s time to go-</em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian let out a low, swooping whistle of noise and the bird turned in the sky. Flew down to meet him. It perched on his outstretched arm, talons digging viciously into his sleeve.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He took the message from its ribboned foot with shaking hands.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t have any food for you,\u201d he muttered. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The bird bit him once in compensation, then flung itself back into the air.<br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>There were no words on the parchment. Only a drawing of a skull.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian sat down on the ground, staring at that skull through blurring eyes. To anyone else, the message would likely have looked ominous. But Wei Wuxian looked at it and felt relief so complete it had taken his legs out from under him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>They Wens had made it. The Jins hadn\u2019t caught them. They\u2019d run and hidden themselves, just as planned. \u00a0They were <em>alive</em>.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He needed to go to them.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>-</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Escaping the Silent Fort was easier than it should have been, because no one\u2026 tried to stop Wei Wuxian from going. No one watched him, as he dug out his ancient leathers, and grabbed his sword \u2013 as he slipped out with a merchant carrying away the remains of a delivery, under a sack in his cart. For some reason he was trusted.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>That made the fact he was betraying that trust much harder.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He travelled on foot until the deep dark of the night. It was like being his old self again, except that he wasn\u2019t hungry or thirsty, his ribs unbruised and his side healed, the only ache on him the memory of Lan Wangji\u2019s fingers grinding down on his wrist.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He heard the sound of hooves behind him, in the distance. He should have hidden or run, but the noise was coming from where he\u2019d been \u2013 from Hanguang Jun\u2019s fort \u2013 so he waited on the road, sword still sheathed, as the noise drew closer.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>A single rider stopped before him. Dismounted.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Even in the night dark, Wei Wuxian recognised Lan Wangji\u2019s face. Lan Wangji looked at him for a long moment. Took a step closer.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian took one back. Lan Wangji froze.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cPlease,\u201d said Wei Wuxian. He swallowed, voice hoarse. Ah, why was this so hard? \u201cDon\u2019t take me back.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWei Ying.\u201d He sounded wretched.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll come back,\u201d Wei Wuxian said quickly. \u201cLan Zhan. I promise I\u2019ll come back but I\u2026 right now, I need to do something.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji stared at him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou are not my prisoner,\u201d said Lan Wangji, eventually. \u201cI am sorry I led you to believe otherwise.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cLan Zhan,\u201d Wei Wuxian whispered.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Slowly, Lan Wangji approached. Reached under his cloak and removed a pouch.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cFor you,\u201d he said.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian took it from him. Inside the pouch were\u2026 gold coins. A<em> lot</em> of gold coins. A letter, marked with Hanguang Jun\u2019s seal, proclaiming Wei Wuxian as under his protection. One small dagger, sheathed but no doubt wickedly sharp.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIf you wish to return to Lotus Pier, Sandu Shengshou would welcome you home,\u201d said Lan Wangji. \u201cIf you wish to go elsewhere, I can arrange a retinue to accompany you. And if you wish to go alone\u2026 you will have money and what protection I can offer with my name.\u201d After a pause, he drew back his hands, and said, \u201cI did not have the chance to obtain food.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian let out a shuddering breath.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI can\u2019t accept this,\u201d he said.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou can.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cLan Zhan, why are you so \u2013 so nice to me?\u201d Wei Wuxian asked helplessly. \u201cI\u2019m a burden to you. You saved my life but I\u2026 I can\u2019t stop causing you trouble.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re no trouble.\u201d Lan Wangji\u2019s voice was quiet.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cLiar. You\u2019ll really let me leave? Even if all those people who trust you pay for it? If the Jin come for you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d Lan Wangji said simply.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Why</em>?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cLook at me, Wei Ying.\u201d Wei Wuxian looked. Lan Wangji\u2019s expression was soft. His eyes were tender, unbearably so. And Wei Wuxian could only stare, and stare, as Lan Wangji let him see everything that lay in his heart. Just like that. \u201cYou know why,\u201d Lan Wangji said finally.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian closed his eyes. His heart ached.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cJin Zixun wanted me to murder the last of the Wens. But there were only children left. Old men and women. And two people I... I considered my friends. Wen Ning. Wen Qing. I promised to protect them. Wen Qing - I told her a place she could go, and they\u2019ve made it there.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It was a huge leap of faith, to even tell Lan Wangji this. Even Jin Zixun hadn\u2019t been sure if Wei Wuxian knew where the surviving Wens had gone. But now Lan Wangji knew.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI need to make sure they\u2019re safe,\u201d Wei Wuxian said. \u201cI need to help them. I owe them that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He heard the soft shudder of Lan Wangji\u2019s breath.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou are one man, Wei Ying,\u201d said Lan Wangji. \u201cYou cannot protect them alone.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian laughed raggedly.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI know. But I have to try. Who am I if I don\u2019t try? I\u2019ve done many terrible things for the sake of protecting the people I love.\u201d He opened his eyes, looking down at the ground. At anything but Lan Wangji\u2019s face. \u201cI\u2019m not ashamed of that. I\u2019ve killed by trickery and killed to make a point. \u00a0I\u2019ve killed for money. But if I let innocent people die \u2013 if I help make it happen \u2013 what am I? What justice is there? Lan Zhan. I won\u2019t ask you to save them,\u201d whispered Wei Wuxian. \u201cYou\u2026 you\u2019ve done enough for me. I know I\u2019m betraying you by leaving. And I can vow to you that I\u2019ll return, but you have no reason to believe me. \u00a0But you need to know, I wouldn\u2019t leave if I had a choice.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThen do not,\u201d said Lan Wangji.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian shook his head. But Lan Wangji was still speaking.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI told you I was quelling border skirmished,\u201d Lan Wangji said. \u201cBut I lied to you. I was not.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He held out his palm. \u201cLook,\u201d he said.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>On his palm was a disc. Painted wood. On it was a carving of a sun. But each ray of light emanating from it was a symbol: a beast\u2019s head. A cloud. A lotus.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The Nie. The Lans. The Jiangs.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI know you were once a brother to Sandu Shengshou, because he told me so,\u201d Lan Wangji told him. \u201cI have spoken with your brother and with Jiang Yanli. With Nie Mingjue. With lords of great power and lesser. And we have built, together, an alliance against the emperor. Jin Guangshan has long been unfit. And now together we are going to remove him from power.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian swallowed. \u201cYou\u2026 you\u2019re going to try to overthrow the emperor?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWe will succeed,\u201d Lan Wangji said, steady and sure. \u201cMy brother has a spy among the Jin. I would not have found you without the assistance of that person.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t tell me so much,\u201d Wei Wuxian said, alarmed and <em>hopeful</em>. Jiang Cheng. Did his brother still care about him? Still think of him? \u201cLan Zhan, you shouldn\u2019t just trust people!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou are not people,\u201d said Lan Wangji. \u201cAnd you have trusted me with your secrets. As I should have trusted you with my own from the very moment I found you. I was a fool, to keep my silence.\u201d He was quiet, for a moment. Then: \u201cYou would not have run, if I had trusted you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian said nothing.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou may still go, if you wish,\u201d said Lan Wangji, into the silence. \u201cI will not keep you. But let me help you save the Wen. I will call upon the assistance of my brother. We can bring them to safety. Wen Qing is a doctor, yes?\u201d Wei Wuxian nodded numbly. \u201cThere is always need for physicians, at Cloud Recesses.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019ll help me save them,\u201d said Wei Wuxian.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019ll\u2026 you\u2019ll risk angering the Jin. To save them.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThey will be angrier when we go to war with them,\u201d Lan Wangji said.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Was it possible to fall in love with someone in a single moment?</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It was so cold. The wind was blowing through the mountains. And Lan Wangji was watching Wei Wuxian with soft eyes, with an open palm, with an offer to save Wen lives, and Wei Wuxian along with them.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said eventually, through the ache of his own throat and heart. \u201cHelp me save the Wen, Lan Zhan. Please.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>-</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian had to wait, after that. Wait for a messenger to be sent to central Lan territories; wait for another message to be sent back. But they were travelling soon enough, Wei Wuxian riding his own horse, a Lan cloak of white thrown over his shoulders.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lang Wangji\u2019s brother waited for them on the outskirts of Lan territory. He looked nearly identical to Lan Wangji, but his expression was softer. Zewu Jun, the scholar warlord - the one who guarded Lan ancestral lands \u2013 approached them with a smile.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWangji,\u201d he said. He looked at Wei Wuxian, and offered him another smile, more guarded this time. \u201cAnd this must be Wei Wuxian.\u201d</p>\n<p><br>\n\u201cZewu Jun,\u201d said Wei Wuxian. Bowed his head. It was probably best to keep his mouth shut as long as possible. The more he spoke, the more likely he was to offend Lan Wangji\u2019s brother. It was probably best to wait to do that until <em>after</em> Zewu Jun had helped him save the Wens. \u201cIt\u2019s an honour to meet you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Perfunctory courtesies done, Zewu Jun returned his focus to his brother.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIt would be better to wait, of course,\u201d said Zewu Jun mildly, as if continuing a previous argument with Lan Wangji, who stared at him with the resolute blankness. \u201cTo enter Jin territory now is to show our hand.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSandu Shengshou and Chifeng Zun are prepared for war,\u201d Lan Wangji said calmly. \u201cAs we all are. Jin Guanshan will fall or he will not. Delay will not assist us.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Zewu Jun shook his head with a faint sigh.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThen we ride,\u201d he said. \u201cLead the way, Wangji.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>-</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The Burial Mounds were on what had once been Wen territory. Now this land belonged to the Jin. But the emperor\u2019s kin had claimed far too much land, too greedily, and a mass grave on land where nothing could grow held little interest to them.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>This was where the Wen had agreed to hide, when Wei Wuxian had refused to kill them for Jin Zixun\u2019s coin, and decided to save them instead.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>There were only two fighters among the surviving Wen, and both of them stood together shielding their sorry little camp as the Lan riders approach. Wen Qing had her sword out. Wen Ning had his bow drawn, ready to fight. It was only when Wei Wuxian yelled out their names, windmilling his arms, that Wen Ning finally lowered his bow. Wen Qing sheathed her sword a moment later, when Zewu Jun dismounted his horse and offered her a bow of respect, his voice mild as he explained the Lan clan had come to offer their protection to Lady Wen and her people.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian practically flung himself off his horse. He strode over to the Wens, looking at their camp \u2013 at Uncle Four and Grandmother Wen, and Wen Ning beaming with relief \u2013 at the makeshift huts with figures peering out from behind drapes -</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cBrother Xian! Brother Xian!\u201d</p>\n<p><br>\nA small figure was running towards him. Wei Wuxian kneeled down, and A-Yuan flung himself into Wei Wuxian\u2019s waiting arms. He held the boy tight, smelling his soft hair, feeling those small hands grip onto him. Alive. They were all alive.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThere you go, A-Yuan,\u201d he said fondly. \u201cI told you I\u2019d come back, didn\u2019t I? It\u2019s going to be alright.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>-</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>After the war, Zewu Jun would accompany the Wen survivors to Cloud Recesses, where they could practice their healing traditions in peace. But for now, they remained in Lan Wangji\u2019s own fort, where they could be best protected. A set of rooms was arranged for them, deep in the centre of the fort. Food was laid out, and baths, and honestly Wei Wuxian was fairly sure if anyone had said a single nice word to them, Wen Ning would have started crying. Thank goodness for Lan restraint.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian helped them settle in, cheerfully ignoring the <em>look</em> Wen Qing gave him when she worked out that Wei Wuxian was more than a guest of Hanguang Jun\u2019s.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou can\u2019t talk about it in front of the child,\u201d he said, when she tried to speak. A-Yuan was still clinging tenaciously to his leg, and didn\u2019t look like he was willing to let go. \u201cThink of his innocent ears!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWei Wuxian,\u201d she said sharply. \u201cWe are going to talk about this.\u201d Her gaze was narrow. She said, deliberately soft, \u201cIf you\u2019re here against your will\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAh, no,\u201d he said. Smiled. \u201cTrust me. I want to be here.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>She pursed her lips.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re a good liar.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He stepped closer to her, dragging A-Yuan\u2019s weight along with him. Touched his knuckles to her cheek. It was more affection than Wen Qing would usually have tolerated, but she allowed it now. They were alive, after all. If they couldn\u2019t be soft now, when could they?</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not lying,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m happy here. I promise.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>-</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>That night, he forced himself to be brave.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He dressed in his old leathers again. His boots. Wrapped his own red ribbon in his hair.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Went to the bedroom he shared with his husband.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji was sitting on the edge of the bed. He looked as if he\u2019d been waiting for Wei Wuxian to come to him. Perhaps he had been.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou told me to ask you for what I want,\u201d said Wei Wuxian, without greeting him; without anything but the thud of his own heart, which said, <em>I\u2019m home</em>. \u201cAnd I think that\u2019s because you know what I want, don\u2019t you Lan Zhan? And you\u2026\u201d Wei Wuxian trailed off. Shook his head. \u201cI don\u2019t know how to say it,\u201d he said.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji said nothing. His silence was a waiting silence \u2013 not angry or impatient, not demanding. He was still and quiet and looking at Wei Wuxian with utter gentleness.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t ask,\u201d Wei Wuxian said finally. \u201cNot then. You can\u2019t ask for what I want if you don\u2019t trust someone.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He looked down at his hands. Thought of the Wens, sleeping safe in their own quarters, in warm beds with full bellies, all thanks to Lan Wangji.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cBut I trust you now, Lan Zhan,\u201d he said, raising his head. Meeting Lan Wangji\u2019s eyes.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI trust you too, Wei Ying.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian scoffed. \u201cYou have absolutely no reason to.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNonetheless,\u201d Lan Wangji said calmly.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian laughed, a little helplessly.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAh, Lan Zhan,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re too good. I want you so much. And I - I want <em>so much</em> from you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIf you want to ask, you may ask,\u201d Lan Wangji said. He remained where he was, seated on the edge of the bed. To anyone who hadn\u2019t lain beside him night after night, he would probably have looked unmoved. But Wei Wuxian could see the tension in his hands and his jaw. The leashed feeling in him, waiting to be let out.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It was good to know that Wei Wuxian wasn\u2019t the only one practically vibrating out of his skin.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>For a moment, Wei Wuxian allowed a little silence, and just\u2026 stared, at Lan Wangji. His broad shoulders. That long hair. That perfect face and those war-callused, elegant hands.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian wanted him so fucking much. \u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHanguang Jun took me as his wife under false pretences,\u201d Wei Wuxian said. But he smiled as he said it; let his voice sink into something purring and predatory, so Lan Wangji would understand that this was Wei Wuxian trusting him. This was Wei Wuxian <em>asking</em>. \u201c<em>You</em> didn\u2019t defeat me, Lan Zhan. You just took advantage of the fact that I was already on my knees.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI see,\u201d Lan Wangji said. \u201cI have been deceitful.\u201d His voice was as calm as ever, but there was a faint curve to his mouth. \u201cHow shall I make up for my falsehood, Wei Ying?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cTry and capture me yourself, as you should have, Hanguang Jun.\u201d Wei Wuxian let his voice deepen, falling into the role. As he spoke, he took up his sword. Sheathed it. Lan Wangji watched him. \u201cFight me. And if you defeat me \u2013 <em>if</em> \u2013 then you can take me. Use me however you see fit.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWei Ying.\u201d His voice was rough.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI want to beg, Lan Zhan,\u201d he said, feeling heat coil inside him, dark and sharp. \u201cI want to fight you. I want to say no. And I want you to<em> make</em> me obey.\u201d He licked his own lower lip and watched Lan Wangji\u2019s gaze fix on the motion. \u201cI want you to take me as your bride, Lan Zhan,\u201d breathed Wei Wuxian. \u201cIs that what you want?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji\u2019s gaze was impossibly dark.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI will need to know if you truly desire to refuse me,\u201d said Lan Wangji.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian couldn\u2019t imagine that happening. But he didn\u2019t argue. If this was what Lan Wangji needed from him, he\u2019d provide it.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Yunmeng</em>,\u201d he said. \u201cIf I say it, you\u2019ll know.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji stood. Drew on his outer robe. His still bloodstained white cloak. He took up his sword.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The face he turned on Wei Wuxian was the one Wei Wuxian first saw, that night he bled on the snow on his knees before Lan Wangji.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cRun,\u201d said Lan Wangji.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian didn\u2019t need to be told twice. He turned on his heel, barrelling out of the door.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It was easy to sink into the grip of the idea, as he raced down dark corridors, the sound of his own rushing blood in his ears: He was still the old Wei Wuxian, an outcast and a mercenary, running for his life. Hanguang Jun was chasing him. Hanguang Jun wanted to <em>use</em> him. He didn\u2019t want Hanguang Jun to catch him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>But he did want it, of course. He just wanted them both to earn it.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He pelted down a side corridor. He\u2019d made sure to run in the opposite direction of shared dormitories and the rooms given to the Wens, and here there was the silence of rooms long unused. There was a smell of dust in the air. Moonlight came in through narrow windows. In the spill of light, Wei Wuxian saw his own shadow \u2013 and Lan Wangji\u2019s, drawing ever closer.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><em>How are you so silent?</em> Wei Wuxian marvelled internally. He could barely hear the thud of Lan Wangji\u2019s footsteps. There was no noise but the whispering rustle of his cloak \u2013 the sharp hiss of metal as he drew his sword.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Their shadows melded. Wei Wuxian gave a sharp exhale and drew his own sword, twisting to meet Lan Wangji\u2019s blade with his own. There was a clang as steel met steel. Over their swords, Wei Wuxian met Lan Wangji\u2019s eyes.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHanguang Jun,\u201d he said, baring his teeth.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWei Wuxian.\u201d Lan Wangji\u2019s voice was dark. \u201cYield.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAh no,\u201d said Wei Wuxian. \u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d <em>Not yet.</em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian was a trained fighter, a mercenary \u2013 a little fear wasn\u2019t enough to break his focus. He took a step back, forcing Lan Wangji to follow, parrying blow after blow. Lan Wangji was stronger, but Wei Wuxian was quick, and he used his speed to his benefit, light on his feet. But Lan Wangji was more cunning than Wei Wuxian had expected.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji shoved him back with a heavy blow. His eyes narrowed.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He threw his own sword to the ground.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian\u2019s surprise was\u2026 clearly something Lan Wangji had wagered on, because when Wei Wuxian hesitated, Lan Wangji darted forward. Gripped Wei Wuxian\u2019s wrist, brutally hard. The pain that shot through Wei Wuxian\u2019s arm was sudden and undeniable. It forced his fingers open with a spasm.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian\u2019s sword was knocked from his hand. He had no time to react before Lan Wangji slammed him to the ground, pinning him down, a leg thrown over his own, one callused hand wrapping around his wrists and holding them flat against the floor. Wei Wuxian let out a breath that absolutely wasn\u2019t a moan, swore, and tried to fling Lan Wangji off by abruptly shifting his own body weight against the floor. It did no good: Lan Wangji had more muscle, and now that he had Wei Wuxian beneath him, he only had to <em>press </em>to keep Wei Wuxian trapped.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>His body was so warm. Wei Wuxian was already sweating, overwhelmed.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI have you, Wei Ying,\u201d Lan Wangji said. His voice was a whisper against Wei Wuxian\u2019s ear.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian tried to fling his head to the side, to get away from the tingling pleasure of Lan Wangji\u2019s breath on his skin. He couldn\u2019t <em>think</em>. But Lan Wangji lifted his free hand and gripped Wei Wuxian by the air, pushing his head back and leaving his neck in a bare, vulnerable arch. There was no escaping that breath anymore \u2013 no way to avoid the pleasure that melted into him and left his blood burning.</p>\n<p>\u201cIs this where you want to take me, my lord?\u201d Wei Wuxian gasped out. The giddy fear and hunger in him were soaring like birds. He felt so <em>alive</em>. He had to crush down the urge to laugh with the pure joy of it. \u201cRight here in this corridor?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWei Ying knows how to act for an audience.\u201d And then Lan Wangji wasn\u2019t simply breathing anymore. His lips were tracing the lines of Wei Wuxian\u2019s throat. Then his teeth. \u201cDoes Wei Ying not want everyone to see he belongs to me?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d said Wei Wuxian, but he was panting, and without his say his hips were moving, trying to press his aching cock against Lan Wangji\u2019s leg, or the edge of his robes. Anything. He could imagine it \u2013 eyes on them as Lan Wangji made him pant and moan and beg. As Lan Wangji took him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>As Lan Wangji said, <em>Wei Ying is mine.</em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cBut Wei Ying does belong to me,\u201d Lan Wangji said. He released Wei Wuxian\u2019s hair and reached instead for his own, unknotting the ribbon he wore across his forehead. Then he reached for Wei Wuxian\u2019s pinned wrists and bound them up tight. \u201cHe is my bride.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji took his bound wrists and bit around the cloth, a harsh press of teeth followed by the softness of his tongue that made Wei Wuxian pant, helplessly aroused. He tried to shift away again, tried to struggle, but Lan Wangji only pinned him back down and moved to bite, vicious and hot, against the curve of Wei Wuxian\u2019s jaw, the soft skin behind his ear, the edge of his throat. No softness of tongue this time. Only pain.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian loved it.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>When Lan Wangji began to undress him \u2013 methodically, coolly, right there in the corridor \u2013 Wei Wuxian tried to fight again. But Lan Wangji\u2019s hand was an iron band, holding Wei Wuxian\u2019s bound wrists pinned. His other hand was cruelly gentle, when it touched skin: nails skating the hollows of his ribs; thumbs brushing over his nipples, then twisting, in a way that made Wei Wuxian <em>groan</em>. He moved lower, scraping nails over Wei Wuxian\u2019s thighs. Digging his fingers in. Bruising him where his skin was soft.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian forced himself not to beg. Only bit his lip, then whimpered, when Lan Wangji released his wrists.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cKeep your hands where they are,\u201d he commanded.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOr what, Hanguang Jun?\u201d Wei Wuxian challenged. \u201cWhat will you do that you\u2019re not?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI won\u2019t let you come,\u201d Lan Wangji said, in a voice entirely devoid of feeling. \u201cNo matter how you beg.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian struggled for air. It was suddenly hard to breathe.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji moved down his body. Wei Wuxian didn\u2019t move his bound hands.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian felt Lan Wangji\u2019s hair brush his thighs. His lips. Then Lan Wangji began to bite his thighs, sucking in marks, and Wei Wuxian was gasping, squirming, the pain was melting through him like fire and his cock was achingly hard and Lan Wangji <em>wasn\u2019t touching it</em>.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji nudged one of his thighs wider. Finally, a hand came up to palm his cock. For a single moment, Wei Wuxian\u2019s vision went white with sensation \u2013 then Lan Wangji was moving again, his fingers tracing Wei Wuxian\u2019s hole, his fingertips slippery.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2026?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOil,\u201d said Lan Wangji. \u201cTo open you for me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t...\u201d Wei Wuxian began, even though he had no idea what he wanted to say. But Lan Wangji was moving up his body, sliding a hot, callused finger into him as he began kissing him, slow and thorough. Wei Wuxian couldn\u2019t speak anymore. Just breathe, struggling for air as Lan Wangji opened him with steady, merciless strokes of that finger inside of him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji set his teeth at the juncture of neck and shoulder, sucking leisurely at skin. Slid another finger into Wei Wuxian. He was already tracing a third around the furl of Wei Wuxian\u2019s body, and Wei Wuxian felt so full, too full.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t,\u201d Wei Wuxian bit out, hitched. \u201cI don\u2019t, can\u2019t take it, too <em>much</em>-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou can. Spread your legs wider.\u201d When Wei Wuxian did not, Lan Wangji shoved them wider with his knee, fingers sliding in deeper. He pressed the third in too and it ached, it hurt.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian whimpered, grinding down onto Lan Wangji\u2019s fingers.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Lan Zhan</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSo good for your lord,\u201d murmured Lan Wangji, and if Wei Wuxian had even been able to brush a hand over his own cock, he would have come right then and there. Instead he could only stare at Lan Wangji\u2019s face as Lan Wangji withdrew his fingers and gripped him by the hips.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji pressed into him with deliberate slowness.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Too slow. Too slow. It should have felt like a kindness. Instead, he could feel every inch of Lan Wangji\u2019s cock inside, opening him, carving out a space inside him. Even after three fingers he was too tight for this. He pressed his feet against the stone, curling and uncurling his toes, his body too full of feeling and too full of Lan Wangji to stay still.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji drew back his own hips, until he was barely inside Wei Wuxian\u2019s body. Then he slid back into the hilt. Slow, so slow. Then again. And again. And <em>again</em>. It was like being opened up for the first time, every time. Wei Wuxian could only pant, helpless and bound with his hips in Lan Wangji\u2019s hands.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji was staring right back at him, his eyes dark and hungry, as if he wanted to drink in every sound Wei Wuxian was making, wanted to take note of every press of his teeth over his lips or shudder of his throat as Lan Wangji pressed him open, forcing pleasure through his bloodstream. Wei Wuxian knew he was begging, distantly, that he was panting <em>Lan Zhan Lan Zhan my lord please please</em>, but he couldn\u2019t stop himself. He was out of control. Being fucked by Lan Wangji felt like, felt like\u2026</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It felt like being claimed.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cLan Zhan,\u201d he groaned again. His clenched and unclenched his bound hands. Tried to draw his thighs together. Tilt up his hips. Anything, to feel friction against his cock, anything. \u201cLan Zhan. My lord. I need \u2013 I need to come.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIs my bride begging?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI did what I was told, my lord.\u201d And ah, hells, was he crying? His face felt wet. It felt so good and hurt so sweetly, he was <em>overwhelmed</em>. He felt Lan Wangji\u2019s fingers against his cheeks, wiping the tears away. Felt those fingers against his own lips, rubbing the salt in. He parted his lips, little flickers of his tongue against those fingers. He felt one dip between his lips and let his mouth fall slack, still crying as Lan Wangji traced his teeth, his tongue. Fucked him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji drew his hand back.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWei Ying,\u201d he said, dark and gentle, still fucking Wei Wuxian open deep and slow, owning him completely. \u201cWho do you belong to?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cLan Zhan,\u201d he whimpered, feeling broken open, free and so vulnerable he could have flown out of his skin. \u201cLan Zhan. I\u2019m yours. Please. <em>I\u2019m yours</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cA reward,\u201d said Lan Wangji, reaching down, his rough fingertips brushing over Wei Wuxian chest, his stomach, down and down further, before they wrapped firmly around his cock. \u201cFor your obedience.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Three harsh tugs on his cock, Lan Wangji brushing his thumb over the slit, and Wei Wuxian was orgasming, shaking, falling apart so completely that he couldn\u2019t even make a noise \u2013 only open his mouth and wail noiselessly, throat locked.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji fucked him through it \u2013 fucked him through the aftershocks \u2013 until Wei Wuxian was squirming with oversensitivity, unsure if he was trying to get away from Lan Wangji or get more of him. Lan Wangji\u2019s strokes grew more brutal and uneven \u2013 he pinned Wei Wuxian\u2019s hips down, grinding them against stone \u2013 and Wei Wuxian could only lie there, being used, his cock trying valiantly to rise all over again.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>When Lan Wangji came, he groaned. Kissed Wei Wuxian, who arched up to meet him, wishing he could hold him, feel that dark long hair in his hands, touch that cold face which was flushed now, dark at the cheekbones and ears, his lips swollen.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWei Ying,\u201d Lan Wangji murmured. He kissed Wei Wuxian\u2019s forehead as he unravelled the ribbon; as he traced Wei Wuxian\u2019s wrists with the gentlest touch. \u201cAre you well?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cLan Zhan,\u201d he said tenderly. \u201cMy Lan Zhan. Let\u2019s go to bed.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>-</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji carried Wei Wuxian back to their room and they fucked again, tangling together on the bed, Wei Wuxian riding Lan Wangji, one hand pressed to the hard planes of Lan Wangji\u2019s stomach for balance. He loved the feel of Lan Wangji\u2019s muscles moving under his hand \u2013 the way they tensed as Wei Wuxian fucked down onto him, and Lan Wangji rose to meet him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cMy bride rides me beautifully,\u201d said Lan Wangji, gripping Wei Wuxian\u2019s waist with reverent hands.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian made a sound that wasn\u2019t entirely human and ground down on Lan Wangji, feeling the hot stretch of that dick inside him, filling him up. Lifted his hips, whimpering again at the sweet friction and the stretch. His thighs were aching and his body was sore around Lan Wangji\u2019s cock. His skin was covered in marks that were sure to turn into deep, livid bruises. They were on his wrists, his throat, his jaw. There\u2019d be no hiding them. Everyone would know what they\u2019d done.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>This was perfect.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d he said weakly. \u201cYou can\u2019t say things like that, Lan Zhan. What am I meant to do?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji was watching him intently.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWei Ying likes to be praised,\u201d he murmured.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Wei Wuxian protested. And then, almost immediately, as if to prove himself a liar, he asked, \u201cAm I a good wife, Lan Zhan?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou are so good,\u201d Lan Wangji said, in that low, velvet voice of his, raising his hips to meet Wei Wuxian\u2019s own rolling undulation. \u201cSo sweet. I could ask for no better wife.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019ll keep me then?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji\u2019s hands tightened brutally on his waist. Wei Wuxian only had a second to prepare for Lan Wangji to lift him up, off his cock. Wei Wuxian was thrown back against the bed \u2013 he let out a whoop of a laugh as Lan Wangji leaned over him, caging him with the breadth of that strong body. Without pause, Lan Wangji slid back into him, gripping his thighs, near folding him in half even as he kissed Wei Wuxian sweetly, leisurely.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d Lan Wangji breathed, gentle against Wei Wuxian\u2019s lips. \u201cI will keep you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cGood,\u201d Wei Wuxian said, trying not to pant, gripping Lan Wangji\u2019s hair in his trembling hands. \u201cBecause I want to \u2013 <em>ah, there</em>! \u2013 stay.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>They didn\u2019t do much more talking, after that.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>-</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian was\u2026 not going to get up and tutor the Lan children today. He wasn\u2019t even sure it was a good idea to see the Wens.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He was lying on his side, facing Lan Wangji, who was watching him in return, expression soft.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDeep thoughts,\u201d he said, brushing his thumb over the crease between Wei Wuxian\u2019s eyebrows.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAh, no. I\u2019m thinking about how I\u2019ll explain all of this to the Wens.\u201d He gestured vaguely at his neck. \u201cI don\u2019t want Wen Qing to murder you. Or shit, Wen Ning to cry. Do you have any high-necked robes\u2026?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNot a one,\u201d Lan Wangji said placidly, as if Wei Wuxian hadn\u2019t seen him wear <em>multiple</em> high-necked robes in the past.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cLan Zhan,\u201d Wei Wuxian whined.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cMn.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWen Qing is a doctor, you know. She could poison you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou will have to convince her not to,\u201d said Lan Wangji. \u201cI trust you will find a way.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian kissed him. He couldn\u2019t help himself.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI want something to cover my neck at least,\u201d Wei Wuxian said, when the kiss ended. Then he brushed his hand over Lan Wangji\u2019s face, running his thumb over the ribbon now secured back over Lan Wangji\u2019s forehead.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat do you call me, Lan Zhan?\u201d When Lan Wangji frowned in confusion, Wei Wuxian clarified, \u201cI know you call me a bride here, but what do you call me to your other Lans? Do you call me wife? Husband? Anything at all?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWe do not claim brides,\u201d Lan Wangji said, staring into Wei Wuxian\u2019s own eyes with a tenderness that made Wei Wuxian want to jump him and also curl up into a ball of sheer embarrassment. \u201cYou did not consent to marry me. It was not a proper marriage. It would be presumptuous to call you my husband or my wife. So I do not.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat, then?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji was silent for a time.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI say you are my equal,\u201d Lan Wangji said finally. \u201cThe one I have chosen. My beloved.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOh.\u201d Wei Wuxian let out a shaky breath. \u201cLan Zhan\u2026?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cMn?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI want to be yours,\u201d he said. \u201cHusband or wife \u2013 I don\u2019t care what we call it. I want to marry you properly. I want us to wear red. I want a feast. And I want to drink liquor.\u201d He curved a hand around Lan Wangji\u2019s jaw; marvelled at the feel of that soft skin under his palm. That he could have this \u2013 him, Wei Wuxian, a mercenary unworthy of love, who thought he\u2019d die bleeding out on the snow \u2013 could have <em>this</em>. \u201cWhat do you say, Lan Zhan? Will you marry me?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d said Lan Wangji. He smiled then and it was \u2013 breathtaking. The soft curve of his mouth. The crinkle of his eyes. The love radiated off of him. \u201cYes, Wei Ying. I\u2019ll marry you.\u201d</p>"
