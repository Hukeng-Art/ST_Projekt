  "summary": "<p>Alternatively titled: The Entire Goddamn School Gives Up On Trying To Understand These Two &amp; Aizawa is Really Tired. </p>\n<p>Izuku and Bakugou had a long and complicated history, but most of the school was pretty sure that they understood where the two currently stood as rivals. Then Izuku's dad showed up on campus and everyone's preconceptions were mercilessly thrown out the window. In which Bakugou tries to murder a man, has a soft side and convinces his entire class the twilight zone is real.</p>\n<p>Ft. Part 2: Turns out Izuku and Bakugou will work together willingly if given proper motivation. Endeavor showing up for a training exercise apparently qualifies. Aizawa is really tired of these children not asking for help and everyone else is absolutely terrified (and secretly very glad these two don't work together more often).</p>",
  "notes": "<p>I wrote this over the span of 2 days with no beta so take it or leave it. Also I switched to first names with Izuku (and Shouto in the second chapter) to avoid confusion between family members so if anyone's wondering why it's just him that's why.</p>\n<p>\n(See the end of the chapter for <a href=\"#chapter_1_endnotes\">notes</a>.)\n</p>\n<p>Bakuogu might seem a little OOC in this this one, but I think that Izuku being abused would have also been highly traumatic for him particularly since he was taking on the role of Izuku's protector. So taking care of Izuku after a run-in would be really important not just for Izuku to recover, but for Bakugou too.</p>\n<p>I'm convinced that if the two of them had been put up against Endeavor instead of All-Might in the final exams arc Bakugou would have suddenly decided he was all about teamwork &amp; they woulda wrecked him.</p>",
  "text": "<p>\n<span>A bright sun shone in the sky above U. A.\u2019s campus. The good weather had tempted even Shinsou and Tokoyami out of their usual shadowy corners. Class 1-A had all somewhat gathered on a hill with their lunches, the different groups of the classroom clustered together with some good natured teasing shouted into the warm summer breeze. The other freshman classes were also out enjoying the sunshine, all not quite gathered around the hill but sitting nearby it. Surprisingly, besides some light ribbing between Shinsou and Monoma, there hadn\u2019t been any arguments between the classes. Everyone was just in too good of a mood for it.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Even Bakugou had been caught smiling not once but twice. Real smiles too, not his manic battle grin. Ashido had gotten a photo of the act while he wasn\u2019t paying attention (a nice one too!) that she knew she\u2019d be hounded for in the evening. For right now though, everything was bright and sunny, nobody was in the hospital or going through emotional crises. Things were good. It almost felt like they were all just normal teenagers for a change, having a nice day outside.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Aizawa had been sitting by a open window, not wanting to strain his eyes in the sunlight but wanting to be able to watch over his kids all the same. He had papers to grade in front of him, but his eyes kept finding their way out the window. Across the table from him his husband smiled fondly. It took a moment for Aizawa to realize that he was smiling too. No more than the ghost of a grin, but there nonetheless. God he was getting soft. A whole year had almost gone by and he\u2019d only expelled a single student in all that time. Still, this class always seemed to find a way to surprise him. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Just outside campus, a man with dark black hair stepped out of a car. He thanked the driver and sent the man on his way with a nice tip. It had been a long time since he\u2019d been in this city, and even longer since he was near this school. He regarded the walls with a fond grin. Not that it had ever been his school, but he had dreamed of it once upon a time. Now though, he wasn\u2019t here for the school, but one of the students within it. His gaze soften further as he thought of Izuku. It had been so long since he\u2019d last seen the boy outside of photographs. Who know he\u2019d end up getting a quirk after all, let alone make it to U. A.? Hisashi Midoriya hadn\u2019t, but goodness that boy was always finding ways to surprise him. Now that he was on leave, Hisashi was excited to see his son again. It\u2019d been too long since he was last able to speak with Izuku and he was sure they had plenty to catch up on. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>With confident strides, he stepped forward towards the visitor\u2019s registration area. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Across campus, Katsuki Bakugou was hunched over suppressing laughter at Kirishima's ridiculous Aizawa impression. Even he had been infected by the good mood around campus, his usual grouchy immunity not quite strong enough to resist the sunshine.\nA foot hit the campus pavement.\nBakugou bolted upright. His good mood forgotten, eyes fixed straight in front of him, as if he\u2019d been possessed. Shock and fear traveled through the students like a wave, all eyes turning towards the now on-alert Bakusquad. Ashido opened her mouth to ask what was wrong, but before she could, Bakugou was turning away from her. His head rotated in a smooth, robotic manner, eyes narrowing as they locked onto some prey that only he could see. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Inside Aizawa and Mic froze too, quickly searching for any signs of danger. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Before anyone else could ask Bakugou what was wrong, he was gone. As in, he had straight up jumped into the air from a sitting position and launched himself over the main campus buildings and towards the visitor\u2019s gate. For a heartbeat, all anyone could do was try to process what the hell just happened. The whole campus was frozen in place. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Explosions sounded from across the campus and the world restarted only to devolve into chaos. In a unspoken but unanimous agreement, Class 1-A raced towards the entrance gate to find their missing classmate. Meanwhile Class 1-B focused on getting the non-heroics classes under control all while trying to get in contact with a teacher to find out if they should evacuate. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Izuku was unsurprisingly the first one to reach the fight. Or, rather, Bakugou doing his best to kill a man in a three piece suit who was dodging as best he could. Iida got there mere seconds afterwards but was so shocked by the sight of his classmate attacking a total stranger he didn\u2019t know how to react. Luckily for both of them, Izuku did. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cKacchan! What the hell are you doing? You can\u2019t just atta-\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Bakugou didn\u2019t even look up, instead choosing to continue his assault. A nasty AP shot clipped the man in the side of the arm. Much to the surprise of the rest of 1-A, Izuku didn\u2019t react. The other teenager had gone stock still. His eyes were wide with disbelief and fear. Fixed on the man that Bakugou was fighting. As if he\u2019d seen a ghost.\nThe rest of the class was at a total loss for what to do. While Bakugou was prone to violence, he wasn\u2019t going to attack someone out of the blue without a damn good reason. The fact Izuku wasn\u2019t stopping him and appeared to recognize the man was also a pretty damn good hint that something was wrong. Still, with how Bakugou was fighting, it looked like he might actually kill the guy. So far the man had done a good job dodging, but the stranger was slowing down from exhaustion. Bakugou was only speeding up, face twisted with undisguised rage and hatred. There wasn\u2019t even his usual manic grin from the thrill of battle, just raw anger. He shot off another AP shot, this one almost hitting the man\u2019s legs out from under him, doing damage to his left side. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Several of the students tensed themselves and prepared to interfere. Most were hoping to calm the situation down. Uraraka, Todoroki and Ashido tensed as well, although they were all ready to throw themselves at the man. If Bakugou was this convinced the guy needed to die, and Izuku was somehow okay with it, well, they were going to do what needed to be done. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Luckily or unluckily, depending on who you asked, there was no need for the other students to get involved. Aizawa had finally arrived on the scene. Bakugou found himself caught in mid air, a familiar capture weapon wrapped around him and his explosions temporarily negated. Again, to everyone\u2019s surprise, he didn\u2019t whip around towards Aizawa. Instead he opted to struggle while keeping his gaze firmly focused on the man in front of him who was now sprawled out on the ground with several minor injuries. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Honestly, the thing that bothered Aizawa the most was Bakugou hadn\u2019t said a single word this entire time. Usually Bakugou would be screaming something by this point in a battle, but his student had been deadly silent the entire attack. A single-minded focus on getting rid of this stranger that had shown up to their school. It was almost scary. Aizawa glanced between his student and the man on the ground.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cDoes anyone want to tell me what the hell is going on here?\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Bakugou just growled, animalistic and vicious. As if so consumed by rage that he couldn\u2019t form words. The man took a few more moments to catch his breath before speaking, tears gathering in the corners of his eyes. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI have no idea! I was just trying to come visit my son! I would\u2019ve thought I\u2019d be able to see him without being attacked by a raging monster.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Aizawa\u2019s eyes narrowed, though he could hardly refute the point with how Bakugou was behaving currently. He was about to try to get more information, when Bakugou seemed to finally find his voice.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cFucking liar! You know damn well what the restraining order says. You aren\u2019t allowed within 3 miles of him let alone to fucking visit! Don\u2019t think I don\u2019t remember what you did!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>That was enough for Aizawa and about half of the students present to put things together. All eyes went to Izuku who was still standing frozen off to the side, white as a sheet and staring at the man on the ground. They had the same freckles. The same curly hair. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Protocol said that Aizawa should escort the man to the security office, file an incident report and discipline Bakugou for violent behavior. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Instead he kept his gaze on Izuku. The man was yelling out some sort of denial, but Aizawa didn\u2019t pay him any mind. Bakugou didn\u2019t lie, and he didn\u2019t attack people without a damn good reason. Aizawa hated to admit it, but he trusted the boy\u2019s judgment more than he let on. Still, he didn\u2019t want to add any more trauma to what was already a bad situation.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cProblem child, what\u2019s your opinion on all of this?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Those words seem to jolt Izuku out of his shocked state, startling for a moment and looking up at Aizawa. That green gaze fell back down to the man who had just gotten to his feet, and for the very first time, Aizawa saw Izuku\u2019s expression go dark. He'd seen the boy angry, upset, afraid, righteous, and pissed off beyond belief before. This was different. The raw, unfiltered hatred that suddenly flooded off of the normally sunny child was terrifying on another level. Only years of training kept Aizawa from shuddering. It was a few moments before Izuku spoke, a stunned silence had fallen over everyone else. His tone was dead. Filled with absolute hatred and disgust, yet totally empty at the same time. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cGive him a five second head start, then let Katsuki go.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>It was spoken relatively quietly, but everybody heard what he\u2019d said. For once in his life, Aizawa decided that questions could wait.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Instead he started counting. The man before them, Izuku\u2019s father, had started to yell in his defense, but nobody was paying attention to him. By the time Aizawa reached 3, he realized that the other was serious and turned to run. On 5, Aizawa released his capture weapon and Bakugou was off like a rocket. Much to everyone\u2019s surprise, he didn\u2019t give chase past the gates of the school. The explosive teenager choose to fire off a set of rapid AP shots, two of which struck true and sent the man stumbling as he rounded a corner out of sight. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Despite everything that had happened that day, the biggest surprise was yet to come. Bakugou took a moment to catch his breath, eyes still narrowed in rage as he made sure the man was gone, and then he rounded on Izuku. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Aizawa tensed himself, ready to interfere. But rather than stomping over to pick a fight or shouting insults across the entryway, Bakugou seemed to deflate. His expression fell into something soft, like nothing his teacher had seen before. Something between kindness and pity filled his gaze to the brim, all of it directed straight at the green-haired boy who had started to shake with poorly suppressed sobs. Bakugou made his way back to Izuku, his movements slower and calmer than he'd ever been before. Carefully, with his entire class watching, Bakugou wrapped Izuku up in a hug. Murmuring soft words that nobody else could hear while rubbing Izuku\u2019s back gently. Izuku just wrapped his arms around Bakugou in return, crying into him.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Nobody else knew what to do. Least of all Aizawa, who wasn\u2019t even aware Bakugou was capable of being soft, let alone to Izuku of all people.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Every time he thought he understood these goddamn children and their weird history, they\u2019d pull something like this. They must be doing it to fuck with him by this point. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Again, surprising everyone, it was Bakugou that broke the silence. His voice was still soft, at least by his standards, but clear enough for everyone to hear. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIida, you should round everyone else up and let the rest of the students know the threat\u2019s gone. I\u2019ve got \u2018Zuku. We need to talk to Aizawa-sensei, probably Nezu too, just in case that bastard tries this shit again.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>It was enough to shock everyone into action, but nobody dared to speak least they break the weird spell that had come over the wonder duo of their class. Most of them were out of it from hearing Katsuki calling Izuku by his real name, or something close to it at least. Iida silently herded the class back out towards the hill where the general student population was awaiting them, Present Mic and Ectoplasm standing guard in case of escalation. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>That left Aizawa standing there, staring openly as Bakugou carefully wiped the tears off of Izuku\u2019s face and spoke to him with quiet, comforting words. Not once did he allow Izuku out of his arms, nor did Izuku seem to have any interest in releasing the death grip he had around Bakugou. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>The twilight zone was real, here, and fucking terrifying. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>He didn\u2019t have any words, so instead he stood silently by and waited for Bakugou to calm Izuku down enough that he could turn to his teacher. Now his expression was split in thirds, part focused determination, part anguished sadness, and part rage. Despite the emotion filling his face, his voice was even when he spoke.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cCould we talk in Nezu\u2019s office?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Aizawa could only nod and allow Bakugou to slowly coax Izuku into shifting his grip so the two of them could walk together. They started on the journey into the building and towards the office without any further exchange. Izuku's sobs had quieted down until the boy went silent, while Bakugou was speaking in quiet tones intended for Izuku\u2019s ears only. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>All-Might was waiting outside Nezu's office. The hero sprung to his feet at the sight of Izuku\u2019s tear stained face, focus narrowing down to his distressed successor. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cMy boy-\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Izuku flinched back at All-Might\u2019s shouted words, and Bakugou shushed him quickly, gesturing angrily with the hand not wrapped around Izuku. Only then did All-Might notice that Izuku was curled into Bakugou\u2019s side. Out of pure shock, he sat back down, taking in the scene in front of him while Bakugou calmly whispered reassurances to Izuku and steered the other boy inside Nezu\u2019s office. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>All-Might was speechless, he looked up at Aizawa for answers. All Aizawa could do was shrug and follow the two into the office, shutting the door behind him. </span>\n</p>\n<p><br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>In the end it was Bakugou who explained everything. Izuku had gone non-verbal, a side effect of his dad being around. Hisashi Midoriya was a piece of shit. As far as Bakugou could remember, he always had been, but he\u2019d gotten worse when Izuku was diagnosed as quirkless. He\u2019d hurt Izuku, and he\u2019d hurt Izuku\u2019s mother as well. In the end, Auntie Inko as Bakugou called her, had finally woken up and realized he wasn\u2019t going to change after he\u2019d almost killed Izuku. She'd filed for divorce and a restraining order. During that time it had come to light that the man had also committed several other crimes, theft and assault among them. The only reason he\u2019d escaped prosecution was the fact he was a US citizen and an employee of the US government stationed in the US embassy. He still held a villain status in Japan, but the US had denied his wrongdoings leading to a complicated legal situation. Not long after the restraining order, the guy had vanished off the face of the earth. That'd been almost nine years ago. In the past he\u2019d called Izuku once and sent two different cards, but never shown up in person before. Probably looking for fame now that Izuku had a quirk or something of the sort.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>The only good part of this mess, was since Hisashi was legally a villain, and he was violating a restraining order, Bakugou wouldn\u2019t be facing any punishment or possible charges. His defense had been a bit extreme, but Aizawa didn\u2019t blame him in the slightest. Instead he was told by Nezu to inform the teachers of villain threats before engaging next time. Bakugou rolled his eyes, and Nezu made no further comments. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Even after the situation had been resolved, Izuku kept silently clinging onto Bakugou, and Bakugou kept allowing it. He kept talking to the other teenager in that same soft, quiet tone, guiding him carefully up out of their chairs and out of the office again. Again, Aizawa followed numbly. It was all he could do at this point. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>All-Might was waiting for them outside, looking just as lost as before. This time though, Bakugou offered an explanation of sorts to both All-Might and Aizawa, a little more personal than the one he\u2019d given to Nezu. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHis biological father showed up. The guy\u2019s an asshat who hurt \u2018Zuku and Auntie Inko and hasn\u2019t been around in nine years, legally he shouldn\u2019t have been back again at all. The last time he was around though\u2026.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Bakugou trailed off to shush Izuku gently as the other tensed up, tears forming at his eyes again. Once Izuku had calmed, the explosive boy continued without so much as acknowledging the stunned looks from his teachers. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cLast time Izuku saw him, the bastard almost killed him. Auntie Inko was out at the time, Asshole hadn\u2019t been home in two months and one of our elderly neighbour was watching \u2018Zuku. She was really nice, and she knew that he was he was \u2018Zuku\u2019s dad but not that he was abusive. So when he got back, she thought everything was fine and left. We were like five or six, and I lived next door. I was home alone since my parents were only out for an hour or so. I heard a window break so I ran over and found \u2018Zuku bleeding badly with that asshole on top of him. I knocked his father off him, first time I ever used my quirk to really hurt someone. Anyways, I grabbed him and took off. Got him to a hospital and stayed with him 'til they were finally able tracked down Auntie Inko. He didn\u2019t want to be away from me for the next week. Nobody knew where the guy was or what he was going to do next, so our parents allowed it.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Again, Bakugou took a moment to calm Izuku back down, his tone soft and soothing. Izuku had buried his face in Bakugou\u2019s side, trying to shut out the world as a whole. Once the other was settled, Bakugou finished his story up.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI\u2019d helped him a few times before that when it was bad. I dunno, it just became like a silent rule. Even when I didn\u2019t like him I sure as hell wasn\u2019t going to let that bastard anywhere near him or leave \u2018Zuku alone like this. Not after what he did. So when a card showed up from him like five years ago saying he\u2019d see them soon, \u2018Zuku showed up at my house and stayed there for a few days until cops said it was safe. Same thing for the one phone call when he was drunk and trying to threaten \u2018Zuku 'nd the second card.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>He paused, lost in memories. Eyes distant and worried. It was only for a moment before he snapped back to himself. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAnyways, he gets clingy 'n nonverbal when this happens. I know how to handle everything, and he'll be back to normal eventually. Neither of us are going to be able to make it to classes this afternoon though. Not sure about tomorrow yet. He may need another day before he can be around other people again. In the past he\u2019s been fine as long as I\u2019m with him, but this is the first time his dad\u2019s been here in person.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Aizawa found his voice at that, finally something he could actually help with. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOf course, I\u2019ll ask Yaoyorozu to copy her notes for the both of you and any homework can be made up later. Will he be okay to stay in the dorms?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Bakugou nodded firmly. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYeah, it\u2019ll probably be better for him than going home. I\u2019ll give Auntie Inko a call to let her know what happened so she knows to be on the lookout too, she may come by at some point. I\u2019ll text you updates as I find stuff out.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Aizawa nodded in return, and Bakugou seemed ready to start the journey back to the dorms. It was only then that All-Might finally found his voice too. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIs-I mean - My apologizes - Are you sure-\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cTake a breath.\u201d Aizawa rolled his eyes at his fellow teacher\u2019s stuttering even if he understood the feeling. All-Might did so, recollecting himself and thinking through the situation a little more. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cMy apologies, I\u2019m just a little bit overwhelmed with... everything. Is there anything I could do to help?\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Bakugou considered him for a moment, the one arm that was wrapped around Izuku carefully rubbing circles into the other\u2019s shoulder. He bit his lip and glanced down at the green haired boy who still had his face firmly pressed into his side. Unwilling to even look at his mentor. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNot right now. Right now \u2018Zuku needs to hide away for a bit to recover. When he\u2019s doing better though, you should talk with him about it. I can be there if I need to be, but I think he\u2019ll probably want to talk to you about it on his own.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Unsure, but willing to trust Bakugou\u2019s judgement, All-Might nodded, and the two boys made their way out of the offices towards the dorms. Aizawa and All-Might stood in silence for several long minutes. It was All-Might who finally broke with a sigh.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI\u2019m not sure anyone could hope to understand what goes on between those two.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Aizawa snorted. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAt this point I\u2019d settle for just starting to understand Bakugou, to say nothing of his relationships. At least the problem child is straight forward, every time I think I\u2019ve got a grasp on what\u2019s motivating Bakugou he goes and does something like this and I\u2019m back at square one.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>All-Might nodded his agreement. They sat in silence for a minute or so before the end of lunch bell finally rang and they had to get moving again. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Class 1-A was subdued and sullen. Even after Aizawa had let all of them know that Bakugou and Izuku were both fine and just recovering in the dorms, the class\u2019s mood had only barely lifted. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Though in all fairness he was pretty sure it was at least partially due to shock. He was still feeling like some part of the universe had been thrown out of balance. Like something was fundamentally wrong. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Aizawa ended up stopping by the dorms not long after classes had finished. There he saw a sight he never thought he\u2019d see, Bakugou in the dorm kitchen, cooking quietly with Izuku by his side. The other was no longer pressed against him, but they were practically joined at the hip. Bakugou was still talking in quiet tones and calling the other boy \u2018Zuku. Izuku wasn\u2019t talking yet. Apparently Uraraka had tried to engage him in conversation only for him to hide against Bakugou who\u2019d politely (a real polite too, not just with limited cursing) informed her that Izuku wasn\u2019t ready to talk yet, but was doing better and would be okay. Nobody had dared ask Bakugou why he was being so nice to Izuku or acting so strangely. At some point the whole class appeared to come to the same conclusions as their teachers, Bakugou and Izuku had more history than anyone else would ever be able to understand. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Aizawa left the dorms before he lost what little sanity he had left. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>In the end, Bakugou texted him at around 10 pm that Inko would not be stopping by as she couldn\u2019t leave her work, but she was safe and the police were doing an extra patrol in the area. He also thought that Izuku would be well enough for classes the next day but teachers should avoid calling on him. They had both gotten their homework done prior to the event so they wouldn\u2019t need an extension. Aizawa thanked Bakugou for the update and told him to text if anything changed overnight. Then he stared blankly up at the ceiling for well over an hour while his husband did the same thing next to him. Usually neither of them were in bed this early but the day had been enough of a drain that they both needed the rest. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Even after a good night\u2019s sleep, the world still was entrapped in the events of the day before. When Aizawa got to class, Jirou had swapped seats with Izuku so the other was now sitting side by side with Bakugou. The left two rows of desks had been pushed closer together so even though Bakugou and Izuku were no longer touching they were only a half a foot apart. Izuku kept his head down during homeroom, focused on writing in one of his notebooks. Every so often he\u2019d glance up to ensure Bakugou was still beside him. Once or twice he passed the other boy a note, which was usually read and replied to either in a quiet murmur or by note. Aizawa didn\u2019t scold either of them, and their classmates all politely pretended not to notice. Bakugou for his part seemed focused on their actual classwork. Still he\u2019d take his eyes off the board every so often to check on Izuku. Sometimes leaning over to add something to Izuku\u2019s notebook or give him a gentle squeeze on the arm. A move that seemed to instantly relax Izuku. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>All of the other teachers had been informed of the situation and to leave the two to their own devices. Izuku remained non-verbal for the rest of the day as far as Aizawa heard. When lunch rolled around, the two stayed in the classroom together, with Bakugou waving off both his friends and Izuku\u2019s. Izuku still couldn\u2019t manage a verbal reply when they asked him if he was sure, but since he\u2019d moved over to curl into Bakugou\u2019s side as soon as the bell had rung, he\u2019d been able to look up at them to give a nod and a shy smile. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Mic had described it like a scene out of a horror movie. Honestly Aizawa got where he was coming from. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>The rest of the day proceeded in much the same way. Heroics class rolled around and they were doing paired recuse practice. Just simple dummy location and retrieval with a few minor threats. At the start of the lesson All-Might had quietly gone to check in with Bakugou who had spoken to Izuku quietly before confirming that they would be okay to take part as long as they were paired together.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Much to everyone\u2019s surprise, Izuku seemed better once his costume was on. Or, actually, now that Aizawa thought about it, he had brightened up as soon as Bakugou had finished changing into his own hero costume. The other was still sticking right by Bakugou\u2019s side, but at the very least he was smiling and waving at his friends when they wished him luck.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>It shouldn\u2019t have been a surprise when the two of them set the record for fastest completion for not only the class, but school wide. Not that he was telling them that last part. Neither incurred a single penalty or lost a dummy either. They had even gone second, which was an added challenge since they didn\u2019t get to learn from their classmate\u2019s mistakes. Once he was out in the field Izuku was able to focus himself on his task and separate from Bakugou when needed. The other still darted straight back to Bakugou\u2019s side once his job was done, but it was more than Aizawa had been expecting. Their teamwork was impeccable, neither speaking a word and yet still communicating exactly what they needed to do with only a look. When the exercise had finished, Izuku returned right to Bakugou\u2019s side, shying away from his friends when they tried to praise their performance. Bakugou had allowed them to fawn for a moment before gently shooing them off. There was a light blush on Izuku\u2019s face by the time the two of them had moved to sit down together. Once they had settled in, Bakugou reached down into his backpack and pulled out a worn looking notebook that Izuku took eagerly. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Their classmates watched from a distance in stunned silence as Izuku took furious notes on everything happening during their class, all with Bakugou\u2019s arm wrapped around his shoulder. About halfway through the session, Bakugou leaned over to whisper something in Izuku\u2019s ear and startled the other into laughter. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>The grin on Bakugou\u2019s face was the softest smile they\u2019d seen yet. It was also the first time anyone had heard Izuku laugh since the incident. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Outside of Bakugou and Izuku\u2019s stellar performance, the rest of the class did poorly, despite how simple the exercise was. For once, Aizawa cut them some slack.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Again, Bakugou and Izuku spent the evening together. Aizawa heard from of the other students that they had spent both nights in Bakugou\u2019s room. At this point he didn\u2019t have enough emotion left in him to be shocked. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Day two was similar to the day before, though Izuku started to talk again. It was mostly his quiet muttering, and only ever to himself or to Bakugou, but it was progress. Aizawa couldn\u2019t hear most of what he said, but it didn\u2019t escape him that he referred to Bakugou as Katsuki. He seemed more focused in his classes and less tense. He looked to Bakugou for comfort less, though the two were still constantly close. That day they spent lunch with their friends. Since their collective friend group was too large to fit at a single table, two had to be pushed together. Bakugou was himself as ever to everyone else, pretending nothing was amiss with Izuku pressed against his side. Only leaning in to whisper something to the other teenager every now and again. Still it didn\u2019t escape anyone how Bakugou didn\u2019t yell once or raise his voice at all. His quirk never sparked off in his palm, and he made no snide comments towards any of Izuku\u2019s friends who had joined his lunch group. Every so often he would also add in some commentary on Izuku\u2019s behalf, either something that had been whispered into his ear or simply communicated telepathically. That was Aizawa\u2019s running theory anyways. \u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Aizawa and the other teachers had all taken to unabashedly watching all this play out like silent witnesses to the most interesting soap opera in history. Now that he\u2019d hit the point of acceptance, Aizawa had to admit it was pretty funny watching the other classes try to figure out what the hell was going on or how they were supposed to react. Monoma stood up on three separate occasions, clearly planning to go pick a fight, before losing his courage and sitting back down with a shaken look.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>By the time day three rolled around, Izuku was talking to others again. It was quieter than his normal tone, and he still looked to Bakugou after speaking more often than not, but his friends just seemed delighted that he was recovering. Now the two of them acted more or less normally in class and it was only during lunch and after class that they were back to walking side by side. Lunch was again an affair, but the group was more lively now that Izuku was participating. The two separated into different sparring pairs during heroics class without complaint, only to join back up right after.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Hearing Bakugou gently scold Izuku for pushing himself during training was something that Aizawa wasn\u2019t able to comprehend let alone explain to another human being. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>And then Friday hit, the fourth day since Izuku\u2019s biological father had come by and Bakugou had almost killed the man. Aizawa woke up and felt like the world was back to the way it should be. His gut wasn\u2019t wrong, and he came in to find Izuku and Bakugou engaged in a shouting match. It seemed that Izuku was back to being Deku and Bakugou to Kacchan. The two of them acted as if nothing had happened between the two of them over the past few days. Their classmates, as well as most of the school, once more gave up on trying to figure out what the hell was going on between them. None of them could understand how the two of them could go through something like that only to go back to being at each other\u2019s throats only days later, as if nothing had happened. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>At risk of cursing himself, Aizawa actually thought he might understand it, at least a little bit. When Izuku had been recovering and plastered to Bakugou, the others had been treating him delicately, afraid they would hurt him. The moment he and Bakugou flipped back to their fighting, everyone else had gone back to treating him normally too. Not only that, but now that he knew there was some kind of care there, it was easier to pick up on kindness hiding in the insults tossed back and forth. Not to mention although he still couldn\u2019t hear or understand the silent conversations that they seemed capable of having, Aizawa could at least notice when they were occurring. They happened a lot. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>He had almost yelled at the two for talking in class twice now when both students were completely silent and only glancing back and forth at each other. It was starting to get on his nerves. Mic just laughed at him when he tried to complain about it. \u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>God, he missed the days when he could just expel an entire class and not feel guilty. Oh well. At the very least his kids were okay now. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Besides, now the whole situation was resolved he had more time for his hero work. Aizawa had a villain to track down after all, and he\u2019d wasted enough time already.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>This time, Aizawa knew something was wrong from the moment he woke up. The universe felt off, even as Mic pressed a kiss to his forehead and coffee into his hand. Now on any other day, he would have just straight up glared down his entire homeroom until whatever it was emerged, but today he thought he knew what was wrong. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Or well, he did kinda know it, but as he found out later he hadn\u2019t known the full extent of it.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Endeavor was coming in to help with hero training today. It was meant to be a surprise for the class, and a publicity stunt for Endeavor. Aizawa hadn\u2019t been looking forward it mostly because Endeavor was an asshole, but Nezu hadn\u2019t given him a choice. So he\u2019d thrown together a basic retrieval situation for Ground Beta and called it good enough. Honestly Endeavor wasn\u2019t particularly useful even as a training tool, he was too straight forward to really throw any curveballs at his students and there wasn\u2019t much of a moral lesson there either. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>It seems a few of his students had the same feeling that something was wrong. Shinsou had picked up on it from him, Izuku was antsy and Bakugou\u2019s temper had been worse than normal. Shouto had also been on edge the entire day, thought it had been more subtle. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Finally the time for the dreaded class rolled around and Aizawa addressed the lot of them.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAlright, today we\u2019ll be simulating a retrieval mission. The scenario is you\u2019re facing a villain whose trying to acquire the activator for a deadly weapon.\u201d He held up their target so each of them could get a clear look at it. \u201cThis activator will be placed in a randomly selected building in Ground Beta. You\u2019ll be told which building it\u2019s in, and working with a partner you\u2019ll need to retrieve it. Meanwhile, we have a guest playing the role of our villain.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>The whole class perked up at that, excited to see who they would be up against. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cEndeavor is already out in Ground Beta, his goal is to take you down and get the activator himself.\u201d The moment Endeavor\u2019s name was mentioned, three students tensed up. Shouto, well, Aizawa had kind of been expecting a reaction but the\u2026 fear behind it was a bit worrying. Izuku and Bakugou both sitting bolt upright was not expected and worrying. Both of them looked to Shouto, and then they turned and made eye contact with each other as Aizawa\u2019s instructions went on. He almost yelled at them for it, but in the end his own curiosity won out. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou do not need to defeat him in order to win. Your score will be based on whether or not you successfully retrieve the activator, though additional points may be awarded for reducing damage done to property, coming out unharmed, damage dealt to him, and effective teamwork. Additionally, the entire simulation is being broadcast so I want all of you on your best behavior. Any questions?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Bakugou\u2019s hand went up in a flash and Aizawa nodded at him. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWould I be able to be partnered with Izuku?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>A deadly silence smothered the room. Bakugou\u2019s tone was polite which was already a red flag. The fact he was willing to work with Izuku, let alone requesting it put all of Aizawa\u2019s hackles up. Usually he wouldn\u2019t allow students to request partners unless they were told they got to pick their groups. He had already planned out pairs and this wasn\u2019t a part of it. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>If whatever was going on was serious enough for Bakugou to work with Izuku, Aizawa would be the last one to stand in their way. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYes, all of you may pick your partners for this exercises. Once you\u2019ve found someone I\u2019ll determine the order you\u2019ll go in.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Now, again, usually allowing them to pick their own partners would result in lots of noise as people argued and various dramatics took place. But Usually had left the school grounds and was refusing to return under any circumstances, so everyone was quite subdued. Shinsou ended up with Shouto as his partner by virtue of the two standing somewhat close together. That and Shouto seemed a bit too shell-shocked to find someone on his own. Particularly since Izuku was taken. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Izuku and Bakugou, to their credit, were still snarking back and forth with one another, but it lacked a lot of it\u2019s normal heat. They were also standing close together, slightly apart from the others.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Aizawa looked down at his roster, whatever the hell those two were planning, it was going to be something. His eyes wandered up to Shouto who seemed tense and unhappy. Hm. Part of him wanted to pull the kid aside now and find out what was going on. But then the rest of the class would have questions and Shouto was a highly private person. So instead, Aizawa chose to put his trust in the problem duo. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Once pairings had been settled, Aizawa announced his order to minimal grumbling. Izuku and Bakugou were going second to last while Shinsou and Shouto would be the final pair. All four seemed to approve of the plan, and they headed off to the waiting area with the rest of the class.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>From there on, things were actually quite uneventful. Endeavor was at least somewhat holding back against the students, while still playing into his role as a villain. Most of the pairs succeeded, with only two pairs getting caught, the first through their own dumb mistake and the second by sheer bad luck. Then it was time for Izuku and Bakugou to go and the entire class was on edge again. The other pairs had just been sent out without any fanfare, but Aizawa signaled to them to pause at the entryway where he met them. They eyed him with intense gazes, and he sighed.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI\u2019m just going to remind both of you that you\u2019re on camera.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Neither of them cared. He could see it in their eyes. Another sigh. Better get this over with then. It only took him a minute to return to his seat with the other teachers, all of whom had picked up on the tension in the air. All-Might looked worried, like he might try to say something too, but Aizawa waved him off and nodded to Mic that they were ready to go instead. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>The starting horn sounded, Izuku and Bakugou made eye contact, that weird silent conversation happening again, and then nodded. As if they had come to a truce. Then the two of them were off. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>In the opposite direction of where their target was. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Straight towards where Endeavor was. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThis is going to be good.\u201d Mic commented, not really understanding what was happening but having picked up on his husband\u2019s mood. Aizawa nodded in agreement as he leaned back in his chair, one careful eye on Shouto who still seemed tense, mismatched eyes glued to the screens. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>As it so happened, Mic was right. From the moment they stepped foot in the arena, Izuku and Bakugou were at the top of their game. That silent communication from their rescue mission practice was back and it was a force to be reckoned with. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Endeavor only had a few seconds from when the horn blared to Bakugou slamming into his face with a stun grenade. None of the students prior had gone for such an aggressive offense, so he was caught completely off guard. Izuku was right behind Bakugou and didn\u2019t waste the opening. He\u2019d gone Full Cowl and slammed his fist into Endeavor\u2019s side just below his flames. Endeavor lurched away from the heavy blow only for Bakugou to slam into his other side, letting off a powerful explosion right onto his shoulder. His own flames had been burning there and worked against him. It sent him reeling, nearly dislocating that arm and skyrocketing his body temperature. Without thinking he blindly called his fire to him, surround himself in the flames. It did force Bakugou and Izuku back long enough for him to find his footing, but at the same time it shot up his body temperature again. Even though he\u2019d been taking it easy on the students up until this point, he was still already running warm and that move had not helped. He couldn\u2019t sustain fullbody flames for too much longer without damage. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>The moment his flames cleared the two were back on Endeavor. He was a little more ready for them this time, but their assault was relentless. Any time he tried to attack one the other was swooping in to block the blow or taking advantage of the opening. The two weren\u2019t even talking and yet somehow moving as if they were one person. There was no time for him to cool off or try to form any sort of strategy. Endeavor was taking this fight damn seriously now, using close to his full power and he still found himself getting beaten back. Their hits were taking their toll on him, even with his high pain tolerance he knew damn well that he\u2019d broken a rib or two and he wasn\u2019t going to be able to keep this up for much longer. Neither of them seemed to be tiring out either. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Just who the hell were these kids? He\u2019d seen they were strong, but last time he\u2019d check the explosive boy didn\u2019t work with anyone and All-Might\u2019s kid was an over emotional mess that broke his bones every other week. When had they turned into this?</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Endeavor didn\u2019t have time to consider the matter any further, the blond brat had gone in for a strike and by some miracle of luck and reflexes, he\u2019d just barely managed to slam his flaming boot up into the kid\u2019s face sending him shooting towards a nearby wall. Unfortunately this also sent him off-balance. All-Might\u2019s brat didn\u2019t take advantage of the opening though, instead he\u2019d shot off after his friend, hand outstretched. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>The entirety of Class 1-A, students and teachers alike watched in awe as Bakugou twisted around and grabbed Izuku\u2019s hand. Emerald met Crimson, a silent, mutual flame burning between them. The moment couldn\u2019t have lasted more than a heartbeat, but it seemed to stretch on for ages. Like the world was in slow motion as Izuku pulled Bakugou towards him. Instead of landing against the wall though, Izuku used their momentum along with Full Cowl to launch himself and Bakugou up it. Once they were airborne, their positions shifted and it was Bakugou pulling Izuku along as he used his explosions to rocket them skyward. On the ground Endeavor had only just recovered his footing, but had lost sight of the two of them while he\u2019d been recovering. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>That was his fatal mistake. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Bakugou hurled Izuku, who had upped Full Cowl to 20%, downwards causing him to slam into the flame hero like a meteorite. Aizawa was pretty sure that alone would\u2019ve been enough to kill most other Pro heroes. Still, Endeavor wasn\u2019t the current No. 1 Pro-hero for nothing, and he just barely managed to throw Izuku off of him after the hit. He was barely standing though, trying to call his flames back to him with limited success. One of his shoulders had gone out already. Surprisingly, Izuku didn\u2019t jump back at him, instead he landed and darted away up one of the buildings. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>There was confusion in the crowd for a heartbeat.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>The cameras pulled out then, and everyone remembered. Oh, yeah, Bakugou existed. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Endeavor looked up a second too late to do anything about his impending doom. While he\u2019d been trying to recover from Izuku\u2019s attack, Bakugou had been building a fire tornado above Ground Beta larger than anyone had seen before. The additional height he\u2019d gained from Izuku launching them initially had given him that much more time to bring the fire storm to a peak it\u2019d never reached solo. Bakugou\u2019s eyes were narrowed in pure concentration, and as he fell he pulled both the pins to his now full grenades. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Flames, high speed winds, and one furious child slammed into Endeavor like a nuclear bomb. The observation room rattled with the force of the impact. No one dared to breathe. Smoke had engulfed the battlefield and nobody could see the aftermath. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>A single silhouette remained standing. After a heartbeat, a second shadow darted down through the smoke to join it. Wind swept through and slowly cleared out the scene. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Endeavor was down, while both Bakugou and Izuku were standing tall. Bakugou had a burn on his face from Endeavor\u2019s kick and both were sporting some bruises, but they were otherwise uninjuried. Considering that the two of them had just taken down the world\u2019s strongest Pro-hero on national TV and in under twenty minutes, the fact they had basically no major wounds was a damn miracle. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>For a long moment, they both coldly watched Endeavor\u2019s body smoke. He was still breathing, but he was going to be feeling this for awhile. Once again green eyes found red, but this time in victory. Triumphant grins spread on both their faces as they acknowledged the completion of their silent mission. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>It was Bakugou that broke the silence at long last. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAlright, now that\u2019s taken care of, I think we were supposed to find some fucking stick or something?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Izuku laughed and rolled his eyes fondly. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYeah, hang on!\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Full cowl returned, and Izuku zipped across the city to the office building they\u2019d been told had their assigned target. Luckily it was out in the open and he was able to quickly snag it before racing back to Bakugou. The other teenager had already started to walk back towards their goal, trusting Izuku to grab the device now that the threat had been taken care of. Izuku held out the target to Bakugou who took it without comment. They walked together back in a comfortable silence, side by side. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>When they stepped back into the observation room, they were greeted with a stunned silence. Even All-Might was lost for words at their incredible performance. Only Aizawa had at least somewhat seen this coming, and moved into action. He held out his hand and Bakugou gave him the target, meet his gaze with his head held high. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Izuku was standing right behind him, just as determined and ready to back Bakugou up if Aizawa said anything.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>At that very moment, Aizawa realized that all eyes were on him. He also realized that there was an untold story unfolding, and while he had some pretty damn good guesses as to what was going on (which reminded him to follow up with Shouto later), there was a lot he didn\u2019t know. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>So rather than lecture, threatening to expel or even disciplining either of them, Aizawa just fixed them with a long look. Neither waivered. Fine then. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Bakugou was again the first to speak, his tone sounding entirely too smug.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOops, guess we overestimated how much he could take. Oh well, nothing to be done about it now. Guess Icyhot and Mindfreak will have to fight someone else instead.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>With a long sigh, Aizawa dropped his face into his hands. He didn\u2019t have the energy to deal with these damn children. That, and he didn\u2019t want them to see that he was grinning proudly. After a moment, he pulled his face up and turned back to the other teachers who still seemed numb. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI\u2019m going to call for medical assistance and retrieve Endeavor. Since our current villain is incapacitated Present Mic will take over that role. Shinsou and Shouto get ready to go.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Turning back to the two problem children in front of him, Aizawa gave them another long look. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou two, I want the full story later. Am I understood?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>The two shared another look, fuck that silent communication nonsense. It had to be a secondary quirk of some kind. Still, Izuku nodded. Good enough.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>He didn\u2019t miss how the moment he turned to go collect Endeavor, Shouto was racing over to the two of them with tears pricking at the corners of his eyes and relief pouring off the boy in waves. Even as their classmates swarmed the two with praise and excited comments, both of them were far more focused on sticking nearby Shouto. Nor did he miss how that evening Bakugou was in such a good mood that he made dinner for the entire class. And if it so happened to be Cold Soba, well, nobody made any comments. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Near midnight, when Aizawa made his last check of the dorms for the night, he was unsurprised to find Izuku and Bakugou\u2019s rooms both vacant. Instead he found both of them in Shouto\u2019s room, curled up around him protectively. All three were sleeping peacefully, so Aizawa decided to let it be for the night. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>There\u2019d be time to sort things out properly tomorrow, for tonight he\u2019d let them find their comfort where they could. </span>\n</p>"
