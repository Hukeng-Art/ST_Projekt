  "notes": "<p class=\"jump\">(See the end of the work for <a href=\"#children\">other works inspired by this one</a>.)</p>\n<p>Yes, hello, welcome. Why did I write this??? I don't know, I was bored and I think I'm funny. Also, I love putting Enid through the ringer, she delights my brain like nothing else.</p>\n<p>Anyways, these idiots are all like 21+ so expect some <em>spice.</em> Though I'll probably not update this fic as often as my main one. Which, by the by, if you haven't read my other Wenclair story, My Love Makes me a Monster, please check it out!! Enid is especially an idiot in that one :)</p>\n<p>\n(See the end of the chapter for <a href=\"#chapter_1_endnotes\">more notes</a>.)\n</p>\n<p>Wednesday, who watches all of Enid's videos and secretly follows her Twitter: Excellent, I'm pushing her toward the edge of insanity.</p>\n<p>ARE YOU ALL...GOOD??? I WOKE UP TO OVER 50 COMMENTS, LIKE YOU GOOD???!!! Okay but in all seriousness, thank you guys so much for the amazing support!!! I didn't think this story would be THIS FUCKING POPULAR!!</p>\n<p>Anyways, here you go, you animals, enjoy Wednesday being Wednesday, and Enid crying as she loses all control over her chat.</p>\n<p>\n(See the end of the chapter for <a href=\"#chapter_2_endnotes\">more notes</a>.)\n</p>\n<p>Wednesday: I'm going to cause trouble on purpose.</p>\n<p>I...I'm...I'm truly speechless. Like, thank you???? You guys are utterly insane, but like in the best way possible. Anyways, here y'all go, have at it.</p>\n<p>By the way, I have a third Wenclair fic planned out, similar to this one but instead everyone is human and stuff, and Wednesday and Eugene have an apartment together. Eugene is a Twitch streamer with a mysterious roommate who goes by the name 'Bats' on streams. If that sounds interesting to you guys, let me know, and I'll get to work on it.</p>\n<p>\n(See the end of the chapter for <a href=\"#chapter_3_endnotes\">more notes</a>.)\n</p>\n<p>Hi, apologies for not doing this sooner, I thought I made the twitter usernames pretty obvious, but I forgot I'm the author so of course they are obvious to me. Anyways, here you go!</p>\n<p>Enid the Wolf - Enid<br>Bia Bar - Bianca<br>yoki bear - Yoko<br>Divy - Divina<br>former slenderman - Xavier<br>ASnake - Ajax<br>Black Butterfly - ;) unknown</p>\n<p>Thanks for the amazing comments and support of this silly little fic my guys, I'm still very much stunned at how this funny little story blew up so fast. Anyways, as always, I hope you enjoy the new chapter!</p>\n<p>Also, to clarify some stuff. Enid is 22 while Wednesday is 21 (soon to be 22), they meet freshman year in college, and right now they are juniors, so they've been rooming together for almost three years now; so these girls are as thick as thieves (who are in love with each other).</p>\n<p>\n(See the end of the chapter for <a href=\"#chapter_4_endnotes\">more notes</a>.)\n</p>\n<p>Wednesday's sleepy little lizard brain: Cold, find warmth.<br>Enid, a very warm body: Hey sleepy head, you wanna sit-<br>Wednesday, stopped listening after sit: Yes.</p>\n<p>No birthday stream??? Wednesday had more important things to, and Enid was in no mood to share Wednesday with her thirsty fans. Once again, thank you all for the crazy and amazing support!!! You guys brighten my day with your kind words, and eagerness for the next chapter!!</p>\n<p>And yes, I had to give Wednesday a poem tattoo and I thought Emily Dickinson's Wild Nights was very fitting for a secret romantic like Wednesday. Also, the song playing is People Are Strange by The Doors; I like to think Wednesday listens to a lot of like 70s and 80s rock.</p>\n<p>Sorry if any of you hated me describing the tattoos in such detail, but as someone who wants to be covered in tattoos, I wanted to bring them to life in my writing.</p>\n<p>\n(See the end of the chapter for <a href=\"#chapter_5_endnotes\">more notes</a>.)\n</p>\n<p>Wednesday and Enid: It's not a date.<br>Everyone else: It's a date.</p>\n<p>Teehee guess who kind of burnt herself out and had to take a tiny break from writing :3<br>Anyways, let's get back to Wednesday causing trouble on purpose.</p>\n<p>Sad girl hours??? In my funny little fic??!! Yes because I love Enid and think she's neat. In other news, Y'ALL ARE AMAZING!!! Thanks for your well wishes, but I'm all good now my dudes!!</p>\n<p>\n(See the end of the chapter for <a href=\"#chapter_7_endnotes\">more notes</a>.)\n</p>\n<p>Me, writing the last bit: Okay just have Enid flirt with Weds and stop there.<br>My gay brain: Right, have Weds lose it and kiss Enid and then fuck her.<br>Me: NO!</p>\n<p>y'all ;v; I don't know what happened</p>\n<p>By popular demand I wrote smut. Shoutout to my girlfriend for reading this for me, everyone say thank you to her, without her I would have lost my nerve about making this chapter.</p>\n<p>Also my girlfriend says: yo what's up, leeches</p>\n<p>I gotta say y'all, we're getting close to the end of this story; there'll probably be three more chapters. I've had a blast writing this fic, and I'm still stunned by how popular it became in such a short amount of time. Thank you for your amazing support, and I can't wait to bring you all more stories in the future!</p>\n<p>\n(See the end of the chapter for <a href=\"#chapter_9_endnotes\">more notes</a>.)\n</p>\n<p>Wednesday comes back for lunch.<br>Enid: Hey Weds-<br>Wednesday, already taking off her shoes and tie: we have thirty minutes, let's not waste them.</p>\n<p>First off, congrats to everyone that guessed correctly on Wednesday being a bit of a dragon. I will say she'll never be a true dragon, all she'll ever be able to do is form scales and teeth, and she can't breathe fire, much to her disappointment.</p>\n<p>Second, we have two chapters left, and the next one chapter is the duel between Gomez and Enid.</p>\n<p>Don't know about you all, but I like to chew gum when I'm all fidgety and nervous.</p>\n<p>Anyways, one more chapter to go for this fic!!!</p>\n<p>AND THAT'S THE END FOLKS!!!! Thank you all for reading and your amazing support!!</p>\n<p>I know a lot of you guys didn't want to see an end this fic, but maybe this will not be the total end of this AU! If I ever get the inspiration we might see a squeal to this fic!!</p>",
  "text": "<p>\u201cHey everyone! I know I know, this isn\u2019t one of my usual Saturday streams, but I have some free time since my last class got canceled today!\u201d</p>\n<p>Enid flashes her bright smile, twisting side-to-side in her desk chair. Enid has been recording and streaming videos for two months now, ever since one of her TikToks went super viral. It hadn\u2019t been anything too special, just her showing off some nail art she did on her claws, but people loved it. Yoko talked her into doing some Youtube for the heck of it, and well - she kind of blew up on the website! Apparently, there\u2019s not a lot of supernatural Youtubers, and so when a bright and colorful werewolf popped onto the scene, she got flooded with fans.</p>\n<p>She doesn\u2019t post often though, college life and all that. She also doesn\u2019t really stream, like she <em>really doesn\u2019t</em> do it, and not because she\u2019s afraid of embarrassing herself live; no, it\u2019s a much more serious and dangerous reason. It\u2019s because she has a roommate, an entirely unique but deadly creature in the shape of a small, young woman named Wednesday Addams. And Wednesday made it <em>very clear</em> the moment Enid started doing videos that she didn\u2019t want to be in any of them.</p>\n<p>Of course Enid took that request very seriously, and there\u2019s never been even a hint of Wednesday in her videos. Though that\u2019s mainly because Enid only recorded or streamed on Saturdays. She had no clue what Wednesday did on Saturdays, all she knew is that it kept the goth girl out of the dorm until midnight, and she always came back smelling like blood. So, probably for the best that Enid didn\u2019t know.</p>\n<p>Enid giggles as the comments fly by, but she catches a few asking her the same question. \u201cOh, my roommate? It\u2019s all good! It was just my class that got canceled so she shouldn\u2019t be back for another hour.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnyways! I thought it\u2019d be fun to stream a game! I know, me?! Playing a game!?\u201d Enid giggles again, clasping her hands together as she wiggles in her chair, \u201cmy bestie got Planet Zoo for me so I figured why not kill some time with you guys by starting a little zoo!\u201d</p>\n<p>Enid rolls in closer to her desk. \u201cI will have to cut the stream at almost an hour though, but don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll stream again later once my roomie is out of the room.\u201d</p>\n<p>She flashes another wide smile, but it slowly melts away as the chat starts to go <em>really fast.</em> \u201cHuh? What\u2019s up guys?\u201d It takes her a moment before she can read some of the comments.</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cwho is that behind u???!!!\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cIS THAT A GHOST!?\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cTHERE\u2019S A REALLY HOT GIRL BEHIND YOU!!!!\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>Enid spins in her chair, and her scream surely peaks her microphone.</p>\n<p>Wednesday, in all of her goth glory, stands right behind Enid with her usual deadpan look. \u201cEnid, you\u2019re live streaming.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWha-what are you doing here?!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThis is my room as well.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo! I mean what are you doing out of class?!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh that, the explosion in the science hall had unleashed a slime monster into my history class. I'm saddened it didn\u2019t happen during the lecture; it would have been terribly wonderful to see Professor Cross get dissolved by said monster.\u201d</p>\n<p>Enid sighs heavily, she quickly turns back around and puts her hand over her webcam. \u201cListen, I\u2019m so sorry, if I had known your class was canceled too, I wouldn\u2019t have started streaming, I know you don\u2019t want to be caught on camera.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHm, a little too late for that, Enid.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI know! I-I\u2019ll make sure to delete the video and any clips, I\u2019ll do my best to make sure you\u2019re-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine, Enid, I\u2019m not angry...though if your...chat, doesn\u2019t stop making comments on my appearance, I\u2019ll have to take my frustrations out on you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWHY ME?!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBecause you are responsible for them.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not their mom!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sure their actual mothers said that to them as well.\u201d</p>\n<p>Enid giggles, but she quickly slaps her free hand over her mouth. \u201cOh my goddess, you can\u2019t just say that on stream!\u201d</p>\n<p>Wednesday arches an eyebrow, a slight smirk curling the corner of her mouth. \u201cWhy? Because it made you laugh?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo! I didn\u2019t laugh at that!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t lie, Enid, I know you enjoy my sense of humor. Also,\u201d Wednesday reaches up and pulls Enid\u2019s hands away from both the webcam and her mouth, \u201cyou can stop doing that, I will be leaving now so you may continue to entertain these parasites.\u201d</p>\n<p>Enid rolls her eyes, \u201cthey\u2019re not parasites, they're my friends.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHm, they\u2019re leeches at best, latching onto you and stealing away your time from me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Enid\u2019s gaze darts to the side, avoiding Wednesday\u2019s dark eyes. \u201cWell...you could hang around if you want to? Maybe stream with me?\u201d</p>\n<p>Wednesday huffs as she crosses her arms, \u201cI\u2019d rather have my eyes plucked out and my fingers cut off.\u201d</p>\n<p>Enid pales, \u201ca simple no will do, Weds.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhere\u2019s the fun in that?\u201d Wednesday\u2019s arms drop down to her sides, but then one hand comes up, and Enid\u2019s chin is pinched between a curled index finger and thumb. \u201cI take immense pleasure from watching you squirm.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUh - um, We-Weds, my uh - my stream is still going...\u201d</p>\n<p>Wednesday arches an eyebrow, \u201cI\u2019m well aware, Enid.\u201d She then jerks Enid\u2019s head up and down a little, a dark chuckle leaving her lips as Enid whines. \u201cI will stop tormenting you for now.\u201d She lets go of Enid\u2019s chin.</p>\n<p>Enid pouts as she quickly fixes her headset. \u201cYou\u2019re heading out then?\u201d</p>\n<p>Wednesday turns and goes over to her side of the room, disappearing from the camera\u2019s view. \u201cAs I said, I will leave so you may make a fool of yourself before the masses.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you think if I\u2019m not funny enough I\u2019ll be beheaded?\u201d</p>\n<p>Wednesday narrows her eyes at Enid, \u201cnice try, Enid, but you do not make a fitting jester within my court.\u201d</p>\n<p>Enid sighs, \u201cone of these days I will make you laugh.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI do find you amusing, Enid.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI meant with jokes and not with embarrassing myself!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut that is when you are most hilarious.\u201d</p>\n<p>Enid points toward the door with a pout, \u201cjust get out.\u201d</p>\n<p>Enid\u2019s viewers watch as her roommate\u2019s hand comes back into frame and grasps Enid\u2019s jaw. Enid whines as her cheeks are squished, pursing her lips out of her pout.</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t make that face, Enid, it\u2019s unbecoming on you.\u201d The goth releases Enid\u2019s jaw, she runs her knuckles along Enid\u2019s jawline, and then gently cups Enid\u2019s chin, her fingers ideally scratching the underside. \u201cI prefer that disgustingly sunny smile...may I see it?\u201d</p>\n<p>Enid sighs, a soft smile blossoming on her face as she looks up at Wednesday. \u201cOnly because you asked.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThank you, cucciola.\u201d Wednesday gives a single tap to the underside of Enid\u2019s chin before drawing back. \u201cI\u2019m leaving now, don\u2019t drown in the cesspool.\u201d</p>\n<p>Enid\u2019s nose wrinkles up in disgust, but she spins in her chair to watch Wednesday walk out. \u201cStop calling it that, and bye, stay out of trouble!\u201d</p>\n<p>Wednesday pauses at the door to throw one more haunting look over her shoulder at Enid. \u201cI make no promises.\u201d She steps out of the room and slams the door shut behind her.</p>\n<p>Enid turns back to the camera with a heavy sigh. \u201cSo sorry about that guys! But that was my roommate, Weds, don\u2019t mind anything she said, that\u2019s just how she is.\u201d</p>\n<p>The chat\u2019s response was immediate.</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cROOMMATE??!!!! TELL ME UR JOKING\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201ci thought that was ur gf\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201chate to break it to u, but that was homosexual behavior\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cLMAO right \u2018roommate\u2019 yeah i also let my roommate touch me like THAT\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u201cOh come on guys! She\u2019s my best friend, we\u2019ve been roommates since freshman year! So what we get a bit touchy with each other, I have fought tooth and nail to get Weds to this level of physical affection! We\u2019re just friends, and even if I was interested in her - and I\u2019m not! Weds doesn\u2019t do romance, she\u2019s like, never had a partner before and like, you guys saw her; there\u2019s a very long line of people who are waiting for the chance to date Weds.\u201d</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201comg and they were roommates\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cgay\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cgay\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201chomosexual\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cgay\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cidk u sound a bit jealous there, a lil desperate, something u wanna tell us\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cwhy lesbians so dumb????\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u201cYou know what, I hope all of <em>you</em> drown in the cesspool,\u201d Enid hisses, and the stream is cut short.</p>\n<p>When Enid checks her Twitter a few hours later, she almost faints from her pure horror. More than a dozen clips tweeted at her, retweeted and liked by over a thousand people and the number just keeps climbing. The worst part? She watched one clip, where Wednesday stands out of frame and is grabbing her chin, asking for a smile, and Enid feels like she\u2019s going to throw up when she sees how dreamily she stares up at her roommate; like a worshiper kneeling before their faceless god. All the stupid comments weren\u2019t helping the growing pit in her gut, especially the ones from her so-called friends.</p>\n<p><strong>Bia Bar @QueenoftheSea</strong><br>\nI\u2019ve never seen anything gayer than this, and my roommate is always flirting with her gf in front of me.</p>\n<p><strong>yokie bear @CountGayula</strong><br>\nLMAO u two arent even dating and u have me and div beat</p>\n<p><strong>Divy @TheBetterFishTwin</strong><br>\nPuppy :,( you never told me you and Weds were together!!! I want my double dates!!!!</p>\n<p><strong>ASnake @snakes_have_legs</strong><br>\nwhoa u and weds??? congrats man when is the wedding???</p>\n<p><strong>Enid the Wolf @pinkclaws</strong><br>\nfuck this i\u2019m deleting twitter</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay you little freaks, we\u2019re having a talk before we dive into this stream.\u201d</p>\n<p>Enid\u2019s claws are out, a perfectly done sunset gradient with dark purple clouds toward the tips; just recently done for her usual Friday Instagram posts and already with over five hundred likes. Of course, an average number, but one that is steadily growing and will reach a thousand by Sunday; but that\u2019s beside the point. Enid growls, the noise reverbing in her chest as she talks in a voice far lower than her natural pitch and tone of chiming bells and saccharine.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe are <strong><em>not</em></strong> talking about Weds, we are <strong><em>not</em></strong> going to make suggestive comments about my relationship with her, and we are <strong><em>especially not going to keep bringing up how hot she is and how you all want her to step on you!</em></strong>\u201d</p>\n<p>Enid\u2019s voice is guttural at the end of her little rant. Her eyes glowing neon blue, almost white like the moon itself at this point. Her canines brush against her bottom lip, and the shape of her ears are more pointed and fur lined.</p>\n<p>Wednesday sighs, a gentle smile curling the corners of her lips. The devastating, wild beauty of her wolf left her breathless and wishing for the day when Enid lost all control. However, she\u2019ll settle with this bit of madness she has sown.</p>\n<p>To tell the truth, Wednesday had not cared when Enid first brought up her plans of becoming a streamer. She was more than alright with Enid recording her videos whenever as long as it didn\u2019t disturb her usual writing time. So what if faceless strangers on the internet caught glimpses of her in the background, she didn\u2019t care for their opinions of her. However, what she did care for was how people viewed <em>Enid</em>.</p>\n<p>Society as a whole is entirely retched with their thoughts on those who do not fit into their mold of what is \u201cnormal.\u201d Enid is an eye-bleeding bright werewolf, with the beauty of a nymph and the temperament of a storm at sea. Who could not love her? Many people that\u2019s who, the utter morons. However, despite her oddities, Enid still fitted the mold of what is expected of a young woman in this world, bright and girly, painted nails and blush upon her cheeks.</p>\n<p>Wednesday was not like that though.</p>\n<p>Dressed in black and blood, masculine clothes and the scent of cologne lingering on her skin. A dark and sullen gaze, never a hint of emotion upon her sharp face. Her nails are blunt and black, the only color upon her face being the natural light brown of her skin. Wednesday didn\u2019t want her dark presence to cloud the judgment of the masses, so she did what she does best; kept herself out of Enid\u2019s social life.</p>\n<p>Though, it seems like she has jumped to conclusions. Not the first she has done that, and this will certainly not be the last time she does it.</p>\n<p>A chuckle escapes Wednesday as she watches Enid\u2019s viewers whimper and whine about their disappointment.</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cbut-but-but goth gf ;v;\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cpwease can we see her again??? we\u2019ll behave, right guys, fucking say yes my dudes\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cto quote my newly founded King of Darkness \u2018I make no promises\u2019\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201ci will pay to have her chokeslam me into the fucking ground\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u201cHEY! HEY!\u201d Enid points a clawed finger at the camera. \u201cWHAT DID I JUST FUCKING SAY?! YOU WANT ME TO STOP STREAMING?! I\u2019LL FUCKING DO IT!\u201d</p>\n<p>Wednesday lets out another breathy chuckle, \u201cmia preziosa lupa, your suffering is <em>delicious.</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>A light tap at her ankle draws her attention away from her phone to the task at hand. Wednesday shuts off her phone and tucks it away, she leans forward on the ball of her feet to track her target. The moonless night above sets the scene like a nightmare; her prey creeps through the more dimly lit and less traveled corridors, trying to sneak from her boyfriend\u2019s dorm back to her own. Wednesday stalks from high above, her movements swift and silent, her small figure just another flicker of shadow against the black sky.</p>\n<p>Zoe Baxter, werewolf, twenty-four years old, currently a senior and studying for a major in law; but most importantly, she was Enid\u2019s ex. Their breakup happened a fortnight ago, caught cheating when Enid had dropped by unannounced to the other werewolf\u2019s dorm. Baxter is fortunate Wednesday didn\u2019t skin her that very night, as Wednesday had been too busy with soothing her injured wolf, providing what little warmth she could give. Now, Baxter\u2019s time has finally come, her luck all dried up.</p>\n<p>The moment Baxter pauses, takes the time to check something on her phone, Wednesday pounces. She lands in a low crouch right in front of the werewolf, causing her to startle and drop her phone. The shriek that was just beginning to leave Baxter\u2019s mouth is cut off sharply as Wednesday springs forward, slamming palm against the underside of Baxter\u2019s chin. Wednesday doesn\u2019t stop her momentum; she angles her shoulder so the full weight of her tiny frame rams right into the solar plexus. Her other hand quickly comes up to wrap around Baxter\u2019s throat, her fingertips pressing in tight to briefly stop the werewolf from regaining her breath.</p>\n<p>Baxter\u2019s back collides with the stone wall. She blinks hard a few times, before her eyes go wide and wild with terror as she finally sees who her attacker is. Wednesday bares her teeth in a satisfied grin.</p>\n<p>\u201cLet\u2019s have a little chat, Baxter.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wednesday opens the door without a sound. The first thing to welcome her home is the howling laughter of Enid, and she feels the tension of her body break. Her shoulders soften, her back not as ramrod straight. She drifts in like a phantom, shutting the door without grabbing Enid\u2019s attention. She takes a minute to admire her wolf, her makeup spilling around her desk in a chaotic order that only Enid understood. Applying a buttery yellow eyeshadow to her right eye with a steady hand despite her animated chatter.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, for real I\u2019m telling the truth!\u201d Enid said as she paused to glance at the fast-paced chat, wolfish grin pointed at the camera. \u201cShe just looked me dead in the eye and was all like \u2018this is your problem now\u2019 and shoved the whole garlic knot into her mouth, I literally screamed!\u201d She barks in laughter again, turning back to her mirror. \u201cLet this be a lesson when making friends with vampires, be careful not to end up with the crazy, reckless ones cause they will take years off of your life with their bullshit.\u201d</p>\n<p>Enid puts down her eyeshadow palette before picking up the mirror, she angles it around her face with a soft smile. \u201cSo, what are we thinking guys? I think a bit of pink at the inner eye will look-\u201d the face of the mirror passes over the door, catching the reflection of Wednesday, and Enid lets out a bloodcurdling scream.</p>\n<p>Wednesday smirks slightly.</p>\n<p>\u201cWEDNESDAY!\u201d The smirk immediately melts away. \u201cHow many times have I told you not to do that?!\u201d</p>\n<p>The goth girl saunters over to Enid, \u201cI stopped counting after the first week of rooming with you.\u201d Wednesday reaches out and grabs Enid\u2019s chin between her index finger and thumb. She turns Enid\u2019s face up, leaning down a little with a small hum, \u201cthe yellow is...nice, but I think a darker color would compliment your eyes far better...hm, perhaps magenta.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYo-you know about this kind of stuff?\u201d</p>\n<p>Wednesday releases Enid, standing up straight again, \u201cof course, I pay attention when you ramble on about it.\u201d She spares a glance toward the computer screen, and sighs heavily as she narrows her eyes. \u201cAh yes, hello leeches, I see you all are continuing to drain the life force from my roommate.\u201d</p>\n<p>Enid snorts, \u201cyou have no idea - oh god, not again!\u201d</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cWEDNESDAY THE KING HAS A NAME!!!!!\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201comfg how is that literally so perfect for her\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201clooking good 2night king, where u been at???\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201chey ummmmm not to bring down the mood but uhhhh is that blood on your hand?????!!!\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>Wednesday looks down at her hand, cocking an eyebrow slightly; she lifts her hand up so the viewers and Enid could now clearly see her bloody knuckles. \u201cHm, it would seem so. Worry not, Enid, it isn\u2019t my blood.\u201d</p>\n<p>Enid sighs, rubbing her temples, \u201cI figured, Weds, do I even want to know?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019ll hear the news soon enough,\u201d Wednesday said as she reached into one of the inner pockets of her leather jacket. She pulls out a black handkerchief and starts wiping the blood from her knuckles, \u201capologies though, I didn\u2019t mean to touch you with my sullied hand.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine, Weds, I don\u2019t mind.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt seems like the leeches don\u2019t mind either.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHuh?

Can\u2019t you be chill like just a little bit? Can you stop embarrassing me in front of Wednesday!?\u201d Enid pants a little bit, and then her lungs freeze up. She turns ever so slowly, and <em>looks down at Wednesday.</em> \u201c<em>Oh no.</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cHOLD UP HOLDUP OUR KING IS A SHORT KING!!!!\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cWTF I\u2019M GONNA CRY SHE SO TINY\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cgoth, butch, tiny af, she IS lesbian catnip\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cI need exact height NOW\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cI did the maths evryone and it says...too fucking small for this world\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\"STOP BEING GREEDY ENID SHARE UR GF WITH US\"</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cok what next, she\u2019s good at sports?? can dance?? can play a goddamn guitar or something???\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>Wednesday looks up at Enid, a slight smirk playing at her lips. \u201cOh Enid, have you told them that I pla-\u201d</p>\n<p>Enid\u2019s hand slaps over Wednesday\u2019s mouth, the tips of her claws leaving tingling pinpricks on Wednesday\u2019s cheeks. The werewolf leans in, looming over Wednesday, \u201cyou know what, I think I\u2019ll get a new roommate since my current one is so fucking annoying.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wednesday simply smirks against the palm of Enid\u2019s hand, relishing in the glorious sight of her gorgeous, snarling wolf.</p>\n<p><strong>Enid the Wolf @pinkclaws</strong><br>\nSHE BROKE MY EX\u2019S JAW THE JANITOR FOUND HER UNCONSCIOUS IN ONE OF THE HALLWAYS EARLY THIS MORNING!

Clips from the past two streams, featuring the two roommates and their banter and touches. Posts gushing over them and saying over and over again how lucky Enid was to have Wednesday. A lot of art of Wednesday, <em>like a scary amount of art of Wednesday.</em> Enid quickly exits the tag after seeing an especially <em>spicy</em> drawing of Wednesday that she refuses to think about in fear of passing out.</p>\n<p>Enid hangs her head with a heavy sigh, burying her face into her hands. \u201cThis is really my life now.\u201d</p>\n<p>Her head snaps up as the door opens. Wednesday steps in, but pauses when their eyes meet. \u201cEnid? Are you alright? You look-\u201d</p>\n<p>Wednesday never gets to finish her sentence as Enid launches herself at the goth. <em>Fine, everyone wanted a goddamn kiss, <strong>she\u2019ll give them a fucking kiss.</strong></em></p>\n<p><strong>Enid the Wolf @pinkclaws</strong><br>\nlove my roomie &lt;3</p>\n<p>\n<em>The picture is a selfie of the two roommates entangled on the wooden floor of their dorm. Enid has Wednesday in a chokehold, a wide grin showing off sharp canines; her right cheek is being smushed by Wednesday\u2019s hand as the goth tries to push her away. Standing out against the light brown skin of her left cheek is a smudged mark of lips stained bubblegum pink; the same color of lipstick that Enid currently wore.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>enidthewolf</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>The picture is of a hand; light brown skin, faint scars covering sharp knuckles and slender fingers. A thick band ring of steel is on the thumb, a joint ring of a raven's skull on the middle finger, and a thin band of rose-gold on the pinky.

Any good stories of you breaking hearts?</em>\n</p>\n<p>More messages flood in with agreement.</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cyeah!!! does our fluffball have a darker side??\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201coh shit, idk if u have ever told us something like that\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cEnid, are you secretly a bad bitch??!!!\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>Enid flushes a bit red, but a delighted laugh escapes her as she finishes cleaning her left hand. \u201cOh gosh, uh well, you all have seen me get a bit...growly, you know, as a werewolf I feel my emotions pretty strongly, so...yeah there have been a few...moments.\u201d</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cshe\u2019s not all sunshine and rainbows!!!\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cOH YOU GOTTA TELL US NOW\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cpls tell me you ripped out a man\u2019s throat with your teeth\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u201cOh well, I...I\u2019ll admit there was blood.\u201d Enid flashes a sheepish smile as she grabs a bottle of nail polish, a nice plum purple. \u201cSo, this was last year, and like I love a good party and there was a little thing set up out in the woods near campus. Me and a couple of friends decided to go, and I was having a good time; I mainly stuck to some virgin cocktails, I kind of hate drinking, but that\u2019s beside the point. So um, this girl came up to me...\u201d</p>\n<p>Enid carefully starts painting her thumb nail. \u201cI\u2019m a bit of a gossip around school, so I knew this girl, and I knew she was trouble; a real ladykiller, dates them for a few weeks, dumps them when she gets bored. Now a little bit context before I really get into the next part...I\u2019m still pretty new to like, controlling myself, I literally have only just wolfed out in my freshman year, I only have like two and half years under my belt of being a fully-fledged werewolf, so keep that in mind for the rest of the story.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShe starts chatting me up, and I try to be polite at first,\u201d Enid sighs, pausing to lightly blow on her thumb nail, and then continuing. \u201cShe tries to get me to drink a beer, I say no, and then she\u2019s asking if I wanna leave the party with her and have \u2018fun\u2019 elsewhere, which...ew. I tell her no and try to walk away, but she gets in my way and starts getting nasty with me. Like, you know I do date, I\u2019ve had a few girlfriends since starting college, but I...I\u2019ve never had sex, and you know...that\u2019s a thing that gets around and this fucking asshole just has to bring it up.\u201d</p>\n<p>Enid shoves aside the bottle, and grabs another one, a deep red color this time. She inhales deeply through her nose, before exhaling softly through her mouth. \u201cSo she\u2019s calling me stupid shit, needling me and stuff and...I kind of snapped. I came out to have a good time, just wanted to party a little, maybe get a girl\u2019s number; but sometimes people just want to be dicks. So my claws came out and I scratched her face.\u201d</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cYOOOO GET HER ASS\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201ctbh she deserved it\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cyeah fuck that bitch, no one disrespects our enid!!!\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cwell she fucked around, and she found out lmao\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>Enid giggles, brightening up with a big smile, \u201cthis kitty has claws and she\u2019s not afraid to use them!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh? Do you go by kitty now?\u201d</p>\n<p>Enid jumps, banging her knee against the desk. \u201cFUCK! WEDNESDAY!\u201d</p>\n<p>Wednesday is by her side in an instant, she kneels down and turns Enid\u2019s desk chair to face her. Wednesday\u2019s brow is furrowed, she gingerly grasps Enid\u2019s leg by the back of the knee. \u201cAre you alright?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m fine, I\u2019m fine, you just scared me...again.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI...I apologize, I simply enjoy terrifying you a little, but not hurting you.\u201d Wednesday places her other hand on Enid\u2019s calf, her fingertips tracing a soft pattern against her skin.</p>\n<p>Enid\u2019s eyes dart around the room, doing everything in her willpower to not look at her roommate who is on her knees looking up with those dark, intense eyes. <em>Oh I have definitely had this dream one too many times.</em> \u201cYou\u2019re good! Ju-just get up already!\u201d</p>\n<p>Wednesday raises an eyebrow, her head tilting slightly to the side. \u201cI haven\u2019t properly apologized yet.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHuh? You just said-\u201d</p>\n<p>Wednesday leans forward and places a feather-light kiss against Enid\u2019s knee. She slowly pulls away, prolonging the contact as much as she could before straightening up a little. \u201cThere, a proper apology for my actions-\u201d Wednesday looks up, and her eyes widen a bit, \u201cEnid?\u201d</p>\n<p>Enid is slumped back in her desk chair, her entire body loose and dead weight. Wednesday stands up, crossing her arms as she stares at her passed out roommate, \u201chm, it seems I\u2019ll have to apologize again...once she wakes up.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wednesday turns toward the computer with a narrowed stare.</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cHOME GIRL JUST FUCKING DIED\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cTBH I WOULD HAVE PASSED OUT TOO\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cwould it be mean to clip this????\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201coh no Weds is looking at us\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cuhhh hey there Weds, so like...are u taking over the stream now?\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>Wednesday says nothing as she cleans up Enid\u2019s desk, putting away the nail polishes and the remover. She dumps the used cotton balls into the trash bin before turning her sights back onto the computer. \u201cGoodbye leeches, I need to take care of mia lupa.\u201d</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201c...wait, did you just call her your wolf??!!\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>Wednesday simply smirks, and the stream goes black.</p>\n<p>Enid stares blankly at her phone. In the morning, just before getting ready for the day, Enid always checked her social media, just a quick scan at her notifications; however, this morning she finds herself going against her usual routine. She checks the number again, but it is still the same, it hasn\u2019t gone down nor up after refreshing the page for the twentieth time now. Two months on YouTube, and being more active on Twitter, Instagram, and TikTok, had seen a jump in followers all across her accounts. But this was <em>ridiculous.</em></p>\n<p>Her seven thousand followers on YouTube have jumped to <em>thirty-five</em> thousand. The same with her Twitter, Instagram, and TikTok, her followers now count in the double digits, and there was only one person to blame - or to thank, she guesses. Enid stands up and creeps over to the other side of the room, and she looms over the slumbering form of her handsome roommate.</p>\n<p>After almost three years of living together, Enid is used to most of Wednesday\u2019s weird habits and quirks, but one that still throws her off balance every time is how Wednesday sleeps on Sundays. The goth ran on little to no sleep, staying up late until the early morning, Enid has woken up many times to see Wednesday\u2019s bed empty, or her curled up with a book. When her gloomy roommate did sleep though, she laid on her back with her arms crossed over her chest, perfectly stiff and still, like a corpse in a casket. However, Sundays were different.</p>\n<p>Wednesday is laying on her stomach, her head turned toward the window, though her face is practically buried into the pillow. Midnight black hair spread out over the black sheets and pillow, absorbing the sunlight that dared to touch it. The blanket has fallen around her waist, revealing skin and ink that only Enid is allowed to see, to touch. Enid reaches out, and gingerly she brushes aside Wednesday\u2019s long hair before her fingertips run over black lines. The snarling wolf is so life-like that sometimes Enid believes it\u2019ll jump from Wednesday\u2019s skin and maul her. Enid\u2019s fingers dance from the shoulder blade, taking a moment to trail down the lunar cycle that follows Wednesday\u2019s spine before it disappears under her tank top. Enid is just starting to trace the beak of a raven on Wednesday\u2019s right shoulder blade, when the goth shifts a bit.</p>\n<p>\u201cHm...Enid?\u201d Her voice is heavy and husky with sleep, a single eye of obsidian squinting at the morning rays and at Enid.</p>\n<p>Enid smiles softly, she crouches down and rests her chin on the edge of the bed, her hand still on Wednesday\u2019s back. \u201cHey sleepy head, sorry for waking you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine...did you need something?\u201d Wednesday asks through a yawn.</p>\n<p>Enid glances down at her phone that was still in her hand; she looks back to Wednesday with a bright smile. \u201cNo, I just wanted to say good morning.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHm, terrible morning to you too.\u201d</p>\n<p>Enid moves her hand, she gently cards her fingers through Wednesday\u2019s hair. \u201cI\u2019ll let you get back to your nightmares.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wednesday lifts her head a bit, nudging it against Enid\u2019s hand. \u201cIf you desire my company I can get up.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo no, it\u2019s okay, I know you need your hibernation.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wednesday huffs lightly, slumping back into her pillow, her voice muffled against the fabric, \u201cit\u2019s not hibernation, it\u2019s a twelve hours long meditative state to allow my body-\u201d</p>\n<p>Enid cuts Wednesday off by tugging on her hair, \u201cto recharge the energy needed for the week blah blah blah, I know Wednesday, I don\u2019t need the Addams biology lesson, again.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c...Enid?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c...Can I go back to sleep?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh...right,\u201d Enid stands up, ignoring the heat in her cheeks. \u201cOh! Also, thanks um, for handling the stream after I...you know.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wednesday shifts and stretches, sighing as she gets a few satisfying pops from her back. \u201cIt was no trouble,\u201d she mumbles, flipping over onto her side so her back faced the window. \u201cI\u2019m sure the parasites took infinite joy from your misery.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>God, I don\u2019t want to look at Twitter.</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAw, poor gattina,\u201d Wednesday coos, looking over her shoulder with half-lidded eyes and a lazy smirk. \u201cCan\u2019t take a bit of harassment from strangers?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou shut the fuck up,\u201d Enid growls, \u201cyou\u2019re not the one who has to deal with it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wednesday hums softly as she looks away. \u201cTrue enough, Enid, if they truly bother you, I can track them down and make them regret it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat...thanks, Weds.\u201d Enid rests a hand on Wednesday\u2019s upper arm, and then she leans down and places a delicate kiss against Wednesday\u2019s temple. \u201cHave awful nightmares.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c...Have a good day.\u201d</p>\n<p><strong>Black Butterfly @dustywings</strong><br>\nif she keeps this up, I\u2019m gonna kiss her on the mouth in front of everyone, and that\u2019s gonna be her problem not mine</p>\n<p><strong>Enid the Wolf @pinkclaws</strong><br>\nGASP you have a crush BB??!!!

Her nails have been painted black, bright yellow eyes and tentacles are outlined and dotted with white. She only has her rose-gold pinky ring on. Enid\u2019s pale hand lies besides Wednesday\u2019s and faces the opposite way, claws fully extended. The lower half of her claws are painted navy blue, black tentacles rising from the painted waves toward a light gray sky. Her pinky rests slightly on top of Wednesday\u2019s hand, wearing a thick steel ring on said pinky.</em>\n</p>\n<p><em>10,524 likes</em><br>\n<strong>enidthewolf</strong> She agreed to nail art on Wednesdays!!!

Of course, she\u2019s not recording every single day, she still has to worry about school and club activities, but now she\u2019s recording on Fridays and Saturdays, and has a stream every other Sunday since Wednesday will be dead asleep for most of the day. The new schedule goes great for two weeks, until the third one.</p>\n<p>Enid takes a large gulp of her overly sweetened coffee before she continues her story. \u201cSo yeah, dude was a huge loser, and like, how do you look at Weds and not immediately go \u2018oh that\u2019s a butch lesbian right there,\u2019 right? If I had a nickel for every man that has hit on Wednesday, I would have no worries about my student loans.\u201d</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cLMAO yeah it\u2019s crazy!! like as a het man myself, i can tell she likes woman\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cdude wtf are u doing here as a straight man???\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201c:( i like enid\u2019s videos, she\u2019s fun\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u201cHey now, be nice,\u201d Enid frowns, \u201canyone is welcome here as long as you\u2019re respectful and kind to others.\u201d She puts aside her mug before grabbing out her makeup bag, \u201cyou guys know me, I\u2019m all about spreading love and positivity, and sure you guys enjoy needling the heck out of me, but I can tell you guys are just teasing me, so I give that all a pass.\u201d</p>\n<p>Enid pulls out one of her favorite eyeshadow palettes. \u201cNow then, what are we thinking today, guys?\u201d Enid grabs a hair clip to pin back her hair, it always gets in the way when doing her eyeshadow. \u201cI\u2019ve been doing a lot of warm tones lately, so maybe something on the cooler side?\u201d</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201coh purple and orange!!!

She pops open the large plastic bin beside her desk, it holds most of her makeup supplies. As she rummages through her makeup, she misses the quiet creak of bed springs. \u201cAh ha! Here we go!\u201d Enid pulls out a few tiny eyeshadow palettes that never see use, and a few nude lipsticks. She rolls back into camera view with a large smile, \u201cwe can totally do an all-natural look, maybe add a bit of gold and glitter, how does...uh...\u201d her sentence drifts off as she sees chat <em>zooming</em> by.</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cAHFKJHSAFKAHFAKJFHWAJFNSAFADASFA\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cOH OH UM HI HEY HELLO\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cDID SHE JUST WAKE UP????\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cshe has no fucking right to be that pretty just waking up\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cUFDOHUJFDKHDSHE SO CUTE!!!\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>Enid sighs softly; there\u2019s only one person that can get her chat going like this. She twists around in her chair, and her heart melts at the sight of Wednesday. The goth stands there in her oversized black hoodie that almost reaches her knees, and her long hair has been thrown up into a messy bun. Wednesday stares at Enid with narrowed eyes, clearly only half awake, and a very noticeable disgruntled frown on her lips.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey sleepy head, did I wake you up?\u201d Enid asks in a whisper, holding out a hand to the smaller girl.</p>\n<p>Wednesday grunts, nodding her head once, before taking a few steps forward and grabbing Enid\u2019s hand.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh I\u2019m sorry Weds,\u201d Enid gives a light squeeze to Wednesday\u2019s hand, \u201cI\u2019ll make it up to you, I\u2019ll head into town and grab you some grub.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wednesday blinks very very slowly, a low hum rising up from her throat, \u201cwaffles.\u201d</p>\n<p>Enid rolls her eyes, a fond smile curling her lips, \u201cof course I\u2019m getting you waffles, only your favorites.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wednesday perks up at that, \u201cfrench toast.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh no, I\u2019m not falling for this again, I\u2019m only getting you-\u201d</p>\n<p>Wednesday tugs on Enid\u2019s hand, her brow furrowing, \u201cfrench toast...please.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c...\u201d Enid releases a heavy sigh, \u201c...alright, I\u2019ll get you french toast too.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you going back to bed while I finish getting ready?\u201d</p>\n<p>Wednesday shakes her head no.</p>\n<p>Enid smiles softly as she pulls Wednesday a bit closer, \u201cdo you wanna sit with me while I get ready?\u201d A short nod. \u201cAlright, I\u2019ll pull over your-\u201d Enid moves to get up, but she\u2019s stopped by a small body. Wednesday plops down into Enid\u2019s lap, sitting sideways with her legs thrown over Enid\u2019s. Enid wraps an arm around Wednesday\u2019s waist while the goth puts her arms around Enid\u2019s neck. \u201cUH!\u201d Enid shoots a panicked glance at the camera before looking back at Wednesday. \u201cWe-Weds, it-it\u2019s a bit hard to do my makeup like this.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wednesday grumbles out something that\u2019s definitely not English; but Enid can\u2019t really focus on the words when Wednesday is burying her face against the nape of Enid\u2019s neck. A moment goes by and Enid feels Wednesday\u2019s breathing evening out against her skin. Her eyes widened in horror.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh no, she fell asleep on me!\u201d Enid whispers-shout at her viewers, \u201cwhat do I do?!\u201d</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cLMAO SORRY ENID BUT YOU LIVE THERE NOW\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cRIP to our girl, she has a cat on her lap and can\u2019t move now\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cu fucking let ur gf sleep on u and don\u2019t move\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cso many people wuld kill to be u right now\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cyou could try to move her back to bed, but could you live with the guilt of waking her up AGAIN\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201clet her sleep in ur lap, she looks so comfy, she is perfect lap size\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u201cYou guys are no fucking help,\u201d Enid hisses.

A black party hat is crushed within her fist, and a bright pink lipstick mark is on her right cheek. In front of her crossed legs is a small chocolate cake, two candles making 22 sticking out of the top with the wicks lit aflame.</em>\n</p>\n<p><strong>beeboy @HelloBees</strong><br>\nhappy birthday beestie!!! all the bees say hello and wish you a happy birthday too!!</p>\n<p><strong>yoki bear @CountGayula</strong><br>\nyoo happy birthday to the spawn of the devil, but wtf man we werent invited?</p>\n<p><strong>Bia Bar @QueenoftheSea</strong><br>\nOf course we weren\u2019t invited, this is Wednesday we\u2019re talking about.

She sets her clothes aside on a small table in the corner. She sighs as she sits backwards in the wooden chair in the middle of the shed; she crosses her arms and rests them on top of the backrest. Xavier steps in front of her with an eager smile.</p>\n<p>\u201cI have a few designs for you, but I thought you\u2019d like this one the most,\u201d he said, holding out the paper for her approval. \u201cIt\u2019ll go under your wolf, and this part here will curl onto your ribs, framing the words there.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHm, adequate...I\u2019m sure Enid will find it lovely.\u201d</p>\n<p>Xavier flashes her a lop-sided grin, \u201cthat was kind of the point.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wednesday narrows her eyes slightly, \u201cpardon me, but I believe this is permanently going onto my skin, not her\u2019s.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, but she\u2019ll be the one looking at it, helping you take care of it, dreamily trace the lines while you sleep...\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c...Do not abuse the things I tell you, Thorpe, just get to work already.\u201d</p>\n<p>Xavier laughs as he steps behind Wednesday, smiling as he views his favorite canvas once more. Wednesday has been his best friend since childhood, and she has always been a muse of his. She is handsome, a haunting beauty that is rare in this world, and when he first laid eyes on her it awoken a passion inside him. Despite what some people might say or think, their relationship has always been platonic. It didn\u2019t matter if he drew her form nude or clothed, or drew upon her skin with needle or paint; their love is innocent, muse and artist, inspiration and drive to create.</p>\n<p>He grins at the snarling wolf that crouches low on the upper half of Wednesday\u2019s left shoulder blade. The beast looked ready to pounce from Wednesday\u2019s skin, which it almost had back when he finished the piece. The lunar cycle down her spine was the last piece he did on her; the waxing crescent started on her sixth cervical vertebrae and the new moon ended on her eighth thorax vertebrae. Then there was the raven and the dove on her right shoulder blade; the two birds flew together towards an old, dying tree that had its roots running down Wednesday\u2019s back to stop just above her lower back; and weaving between the roots were the names of Wednesday\u2019s family.</p>\n<p>These pieces however were just a few of what Xavier has done on Wednesday. The first ever tattoo he did on her was on her left foot; a black mamba biting into the right side of her ankle with its body wrapped once around her ankle then going over the top of her foot in a large S shape, the tip of the tail ending on the side of her big toe. The second piece is on her left rib cage, a poem by Emily Dickinson, and Xavier snickers whenever he sees it; the words to <em>Wild Nights</em> written in calligraphy done by Wednesday\u2019s hand.</p>\n<p>Which brought him to the newest piece he\u2019ll be adding. He carefully laid the inked paper on the left side of her back, making sure it curled over her rib cage correctly to frame her poem. Once done he grabs a rag and wets it before pressing it against the paper.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo, excited for your date today?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNot a date.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSays who?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMe, moron, we\u2019re just going out to dinner.\u201d</p>\n<p>Xavier snorts, \u201cright, if it\u2019s so casual then what\u2019s up with the outfit you planned?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c...I don\u2019t have to explain myself to you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Xavier laughs, slowly peeling the paper away from Wednesday\u2019s back. \u201cJust ask her out already! You know she\u2019s into you, what\u2019s there to worry about?\u201d</p>\n<p>Wednesday sighs softly, digging her chin against her forearm. \u201cI...I enjoy what we have, her and I, it is...nice - simple, I worry my love might be too much for her to handle.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCome on, Nes, this is Enid we\u2019re talking about, she is <em>intense.</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat she is, but the love of an Addams is obsessive, consuming and maddening...I have to be sure, I have to test her.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo formal,\u201d Xavier mutters with a smirk. He sits down on his stool and picks up the tattoo gun, he dips the needle into some black ink before placing a hand on Wednesday\u2019s arm. \u201cAlright, you ready?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhen am I never not ready?\u201d</p>\n<p>Xavier presses the pedal and the gun comes to lift with a dull buzz. He works in silence for the first twenty minutes before speaking up. \u201cForgot to ask, you want some music playing?\u201d</p>\n<p>Wednesday hums lightly. Xavier pulls away from her skin, and smiles a bit seeing her eyes closed, her body utterly relaxed. \u201cPut on the playlist you made for me,\u201d Wednesday mumbles, shifting her head to put her forehead against her forearms.</p>\n<p>Xavier puts down the tattoo gun and quickly grabs his phone. It takes a few minutes before music fills the shed, <em>People Are Strange</em> being the first song of the afternoon. Xavier picks back up his tool and gets back to work.</p>\n<p>\u201cDid you get your presents from your parents yet?\u201d He asks as he slowly follows a curving line.</p>\n<p>\u201cHm, no, I imagine they\u2019ll show up in a day or two; mother and father always send too many.\u201d</p>\n<p>Xavier nods, he pauses to carefully wipe the skin before continuing the line. \u201cAnd your Uncle Fester?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPiercing kit.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFor the last time, I\u2019m not piercing your nipples, Wednesday, go to a professional for that; it\u2019s already bad enough I let you bully me into doing your tattoos.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wednesday huffs as he pulls away to wipe away the excess ink again. \u201cI\u2019m not letting a stranger do it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Xavier rolls his eyes, \u201cask Yoko then, I\u2019m sure she\u2019d be down for it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not letting that idiot see my breasts.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThen shut up because I\u2019m not doing it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDrop dead, Thorpe, you\u2019re no fun.\u201d</p>\n<p>Xavier chuckles, \u201clisten, someone around here has to have common sense, and I can\u2019t believe it\u2019s me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wednesday turns her head, her chin coming to rest on top of her bicep. \u201cI have common sense, and it tells me to not trust the simpletons that work at the tattoo and piercing shop in Jericho.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFucking god, you\u2019re so weird,\u201d Xavier mutters with a fond smile.</p>\n<p>\u201c...Will you at least pierce my tongue?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNO! Just get your uncle to do it!\u201d</p>\n<p>When Wednesday comes back to the dorm, she steps in on Enid pacing the width of the room. The blonde is dressed in a simple t-shirt and shorts, her face bare of any makeup.</p>\n<p>\u201cEnid? You haven\u2019t gotten ready yet?\u201d</p>\n<p>Enid jolts a bit at Wednesday's question. She twists sharply, her eyes wide and glowing; her thumb nail trapped between her teeth. \u201cWednesday! Hey, sorry but no, after you left I realized I never asked about what I should wear and...well...\u201d Enid glances toward her closest.</p>\n<p>Wednesday follows her gaze, and she cocks an eyebrow seeing the mess scattered within and across the floor. \u201cAh, I see.\u201d Wednesday fully comes into the room and closes the door behind. \u201cWell then, we can simply get ready together, however, I require your help for a moment.\u201d</p>\n<p>Enid perks up, a beaming smile overtaking the nervous frown she had been wearing. \u201cOf course! What do you need help with?\u201d</p>\n<p>Wednesday turns around, unzips her leather jacket, and shrugs it off to expose her bare back. Enid gasps the moment her eyes find the fresh ink. A field of flowers; lavender, tulips, daisies, violets, and a dozen other kinds fill up her skin until they reach the left side of her lower back. Swarms of butterflies littered the field, a few straying off to the side and fluttering over Wednesday\u2019s rib cage. The snarling wolf now crouched over all of this, as if it was the guardian of this beautiful field of life; a few butterflies have been added around the wolf, and a few even dared to rest upon the fearsome animal.</p>\n<p>Wednesday looks over her shoulder, hiding a smile by pressing her mouth against her shoulder. \u201cI need to clean this up and put the coconut oil on.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWow...so you were hanging out with Xavier, huh?\u201d</p>\n<p>Wednesday nods slightly, \u201capologies, I wanted it to be a surprise.\u201d</p>\n<p>Enid smiles tenderly, she closes the gap between them and runs her fingers like a breeze over the new lines. \u201cIt\u2019s your birthday, silly, I\u2019m not complaining.\u201d Enid tilts her head, she shifts a bit so she can look at Wednesday\u2019s rib cage. The butterflies form a border around the calligraphy that takes up most of the rib cage, \u201cI never realized you had more tattoos, is this a poem?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cEmily Dickinson, Wild Nights, one of my favorites.\u201d</p>\n<p>Enid takes a moment, mouthing the words to herself, and she\u2019s grinning by the time she\u2019s done reading the words. \u201cYou\u2019re such a softie, Weds.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wednesday arches an eyebrow, \u201cI am not, my love would kill you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t know about that, I\u2019m a werewolf, we\u2019re pretty hard to kill.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHm, Baxter is a werewolf, and she could do nothing to stop me...but perhaps you will be a greater challenge.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNever know until you give me a try.\u201d Enid flashed a grin full of sharp teeth.</p>\n<p>A razor sharp smirk curls the corner of Wednesday\u2019s mouth, \u201ccareful, Sinclair, I might take you up on that offer.\u201d</p>\n<p>Enid trails her hand down, and Wednesday feels the tips of claws gently dig into her lower back. \u201cI hope you do, Addams.\u201d Then in the blink of an eye, the claws shrink back and the glow leaves Enid\u2019s eyes. She straightens up and claps her hand together. \u201cAlright! Let\u2019s get you cleaned up and ready for your birthday dinner!\u201d</p>\n<p>Wednesday follows Enid into the bathroom, \u201cthank you, I would have Thing help, but it is a large piece, so two hands are better than one in this situation.\u201d</p>\n<p>Enid giggles as she has Wednesday sit down on the toilet. \u201cIt\u2019s no problem at all, Weds! I love helping out.\u201d Enid searches around for Wednesday\u2019s soap. \u201cI\u2019m stunned by how much you guys got done in what...five hours?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou know I don\u2019t need to take breaks during the sessions, the pain is hardly a tickle; and Xavier is good at what he does, the piece should be done in our next session.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI can\u2019t wait! It\u2019s gonna look absolutely gorgeous with all the shading done.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wednesday glances over her shoulder, \u201cI\u2019m thinking about getting something on my right rib cage next, I have found the pain to be most enjoyable there.\u201d</p>\n<p>Enid rolls her eyes, \u201cyou know, people usually get tattoos for the art, not for the pain.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHm, I suppose...I desire to have my nipples pierced as well, but Xavier keeps refusing my request.\u201d</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a loud clatter; Wednesday looks over her shoulder again, and smirks seeing several objects have fallen out of the wall cabinet and into the sink, or onto the floor. Enid is scrambling around to pick everything up with a beet red face.</p>\n<p>\u201cO-oh! I-I never knew yo-you wanted to do that!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m interested in how they feel, the same with a tongue piercing; sadly I\u2019ll have to wait until I next see my Uncle Fester. Xavier demands I see professionals, but the idea of some stranger seeing me in such a state makes me want to crawl out of my skin.\u201d</p>\n<p>Enid nods along like a bobble-head, staring at Wednesday with wide, unblinking eyes. \u201cTotally understandable, a-and have you ever thought about getting facial piercings?\u201d</p>\n<p>Wednesday\u2019s nose wrinkles slightly, \u201cthe idea does not appeal to me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Enid tilts her head a bit, her brow furrowing in deep thought, but then her face smooths out with a nod of agreement. \u201cYeah, I can\u2019t imagine you with stuff like that, doesn\u2019t really fit your vibes.\u201d Enid hops back up onto her feet and puts everything back into her place. \u201cOkay! Sorry about that, now let's get to work!\u201d</p>\n<p>Enid licks her sharpened canines with hunger the moment Wednesday steps out of the bathroom fully dressed. The Addams heir is dressed in her usual singular color of black; the top two buttons of the dress shirt are undone and the bottom of it is tucked into a pair of slacks. Wing tip Oxfords polished to a shine, and she shrugs on a suit jacket that had been laid out on the bed by Thing. Wednesday doesn\u2019t look Enid\u2019s way at all, instead heading over to her desk to grab the finishing touches to her outfit. The goth slips on her steel thumb ring and rose-gold pinky ring, and puts a thin steel chain around her neck, a wolf\u2019s fang hanging from the end. She puts on a small amount of cologne, being mindful of Enid\u2019s sensitive nose.</p>\n<p>Wednesday finally turns toward Enid, and she inhales sharply seeing her beautiful wolf. Dressed in a pale blue short skirt and soft pink blouse with ruffled short sleeves, white thigh highs, and bright pink kitten heels. Enid gives a little twirl; eyes neon and glowing, fangs peeking out from her bright pink mouth, her colorful claws fully out. Wednesday notices the shine of steel on Enid\u2019s pinky, and pink diamond earrings that she gave the blonde for her birthday this year.</p>\n<p>\u201cHow do I look?\u201d Enid asks, an edge of nervousness to her smile.</p>\n<p>\u201cLike a hurricane,\u201d Wednesday holds out her hand.</p>\n<p>Enid giggles as she skips forward, grasping Wednesday\u2019s hand and then interlocking their fingers tightly. \u201cAwe! You sure know how to sweet talk a girl, Weds!\u201d</p>\n<p>Wednesday huffs out a breathy chuckle, \u201cmost people don\u2019t hear my words as such.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell unlike those people I know you, and I know you find hurricanes to be a beautiful example of mother nature\u2019s wild fury.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHm, I do...Are you ready to head out?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYup!\u201d</p>\n<p>Wednesday\u2019s brow slightly furrows, \u201cyou\u2019re not bringing a coat?\u201d</p>\n<p>Enid shakes her head, \u201cI\u2019ll be fine! I\u2019m a werewolf, we do run pretty hot.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cVery well, but if you do get cold let me know, you may borrow my jacket.\u201d</p>\n<p>Enid squeals, she tugs on Wednesday\u2019s hand to pull the smaller girl in close, she leans down and places a kiss against Wednesday\u2019s cheek. \u201cThanks Weds, you\u2019re so sweet!\u201d</p>\n<p>Wednesday rolls her eyes, \u201cI don\u2019t want you getting sick, you idiot.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat still means you care, silly!\u201d</p>\n<p><strong>Enid the Wolf @pinkclaws</strong><br>\noh no it\u2019s so chilly tonight ;) thanks Weds &lt;3</p>\n<p>\n<em>The picture is a selfie of Enid beaming at the camera. She\u2019s sitting on a park bench and leaning against Wednesday\u2019s shoulder with a black, suit jacket placed over her shoulders.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u201cI will hear no more of this!\u201d Enid slams the palm of her hand against her desk, rattling the webcam a bit. \u201cOh! Sorry, the full moon is soon, so a bit antsy - but that doesn\u2019t matter! Wednesday demanded no birthday stream, so there was no birthday stream!\u201d</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cbut we wanted to say happy birthday!!!\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cbet, u just wanted to keep her to urself, weds loves us\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cwe had a plan!!! we were gonna drown her in our money and love!!!\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u201cNo! Do not send me money just to give it to Wednesday!

She leans her elbows on her desk and rests her chin in the palms of her hands. \u201cYeah no stream sadly, and no I\u2019m not getting Wednesday to stream, you guys would drive her to manslaughter.\u201d She pushes away from the desk a little and slowly spins in her chair. \u201cSometimes, I wish I could go back to not wolfing out. It\u2019s nice having my mom no longer bother me about it, but I hate transforming here at school, the cages suck.\u201d</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201ccages???\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201chold up, ur locked up for the full moon?!\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cwtf man doesn\u2019t your school have a huge ass forest?\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u201cKind of, only a tiny portion surrounding the school is actual school property. Even then we\u2019re not allowed to use it because of local laws that\u2019ve been around since like the mid eighteen hundreds; and I only know that because of Wednesday.\u201d Enid grins a little, she stops spinning and pulls herself back toward the desk.</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cDUDE THAT\u2019S SUCH BULLSHIT!!!\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cyeah wtf isn\u2019t it important for werewolves to run around on full moons??\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201csorry to hear that Enid!!

No joke, one of her ancestors killed the colonizer that founded the local town near our school; she has like her whole family history memorized, some of the stories she has told me sound made up, but it\u2019s all totally real! She has shown me the books and everything!\u201d</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201coh so being a badass just naturally flows through her veins\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cdude she was born to fuck women and kill men\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cI was wondering what she was majoring in! would have never guessed history\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>Enid rolls her eyes, \u201cat least one of you stayed on topic.\u201d</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a sudden knock at the door, Enid turns around and grins as the door opens and Wednesday steps inside. \u201cHey Weds! We were just talking about you!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAll horrible things, I hope,\u201d Wednesday said as she shut the door.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh tots, I told them about how your ancestor, Goody, killed a white man.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wednesday smirks - small and razor sharp - that she only wears when hearing about bloodshed. \u201cAh yes, one of my favorite bedtime stories.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe also talked about how you are a huge nerd.\u201d</p>\n<p>At that Wednesday\u2019s face smooths out into a deadpan stare; Enid flashes her a bright smile. \u201cYou think yourself so witty, don\u2019t you?\u201d Wednesday drawls as she sauntered over to Enid.</p>\n<p>Enid narrows her eyes, not liking the gait nor tone of her roommate. \u201cUh, yeah I do...Wednesday? What are you-\u201d</p>\n<p>Wednesday grabs the back of the chair and twists Enid around to face the camera once more. In one quick and graceful movement Wednesday is straddling Enid\u2019s lap, her back toward the computer. The goth leans in, her free hand coming up to grab Enid by the collar of her sweater.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou won\u2019t be so witty when I cut out that tongue of yours.\u201d Wednesday breathes against Enid\u2019s lips, so close that their mouths almost brush with every syllable.</p>\n<p>Enid chokes and sputters on nothing but her own tongue, a gargle of unintelligible words leaving her mouth. Wednesday smirks as she pulls back, smoothly sliding from Enid\u2019s lap, and releasing her hold on Enid\u2019s sweater. She reaches out and ruffles Enid\u2019s hair before drifting over to her side of the room.</p>\n<p>\u201cI have an essay I need to work on for ancient studies, so do keep it down.\u201d Wednesday glances over her shoulder, and Enid has recovered and is looking at anything that isn\u2019t Wednesday nor the computer. \u201cAlso, if you\u2019re going to tease me, Enid, do better next time, you have claws and teeth, use them.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cRi-right, gotcha Weds.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wednesday lets out a silent sigh as she gathers up her school work. She sits at her desk, back facing Enid, and stealthily pulls her phone from one of the inner pockets of her jacket. She starts setting out papers with one hand while she types with the other.</p>\n<p><strong>Black Butterfly @dustywings</strong><br>\nI\u2019m gonna kiss her to death, strangle her with my tongue, she\u2019s so smart and yet so so dumb</p>\n<p><strong>Black Butterfly @dustywings</strong><br>\nfor fuck sake I have put my ass in her lap TWICE now, I flirt with her and drop hints, like I\u2019m not being subtle right? can\u2019t believe I have to spell it out for her</p>\n<p><strong>Black Butterfly @dustywings</strong><br>\nok not that I really mind though cause it is fun to see her squirm and I like being a menace but, I want my puppy, would like to kiss her stupid mouth and call her mine officially</p>\n<p><strong>former slenderman @ArtorArtist</strong><br>\ndude u good???</p>\n<p><strong>Black Butterfly @dustywings</strong><br>\nI\u2019m spiraling into despair</p>\n<p><strong>former slenderman @ArtorArtist</strong><br>\nwell that\u2019s 1 way to say ur horny lmao</p>\n<p>Wednesday huffs softly, turning off her phone and quickly putting it back into her jacket. She should have never told Xavier about her account, now she can no longer live in peace.</p>\n<p>There are several reasons why none of them should be here right now. The biggest one is the fact that it is a full moon, so there should have been no stream. The second, the title of the stream simply being <em>\u2018Kidnapping a Dog.\u2019</em> The third reason; when joining the stream, the only thing the viewers saw was blackness.</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cUMMM WHAT IS GOING?????\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cfuck did Enid\u2019s account get hacked?!\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cthis feels bad man\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>Some viewers startle as the screen suddenly changes from darkness to the black and white of night vision on a camera. The camera jostles a bit and then starts to move, whoever is streaming is walking along a stone pathway, a tall stone wall to the right, a treeline is barely visible a few feet away to the left.</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cha ha wtf wtf i\u2019m so scared right now\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201coh god oh fuck are we gonna see a murder\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201ci swear if we\u2019re about to see a dead body\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>Then a voice speaks up, monotone and raspy and familiar. \u201cHello leeches, how woeful of you to join me on such a lovely evening.\u201d</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cWEDNESDAY??!!!!\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cWTF KING DON\u2019T SCARE US LIKE THAT!!!\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201ci\u2019m so confused why are u streaming??? where are u taking us???\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u201cDid you not read the title? I\u2019m breaking Enid out of the lycan cages.\u201d As Wednesday says this a stone building starts to form from the darkness; howling and barking becoming more audible the closer they get.</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cwait how are you reading chat???\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cuhhh i think the important ques is why are u doing this?? won\u2019t u get into trouble??\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cahfkajhfsa ok but it really cute she\u2019s breaking her werewolf gf out of doggy jail\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>Wednesday holds up her hand, and blinds the viewers for a moment with the brightness of a phone screen. \u201cI\u2019m borrowing Enid\u2019s phone; also, do I seem like someone who cares about the laws of dead white men?\u201d</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cgood point, and honest, i really wanna see a werewolf\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201ci support this jailbreak, let\u2019s get our fluffball\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201ci hope enid gives u a big ol kiss for this in the morning\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m actually hoping for a deer carcass, but a kiss will do as well.\u201d</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cAHFKAJHFAFAFAFHK OK YEAH JUST OPENLY ADMIT THAT\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cIDK WHAT BOTHERS ME MORE, HER WANTING A DEAD ANIMAL, OR HER WANTING THE DEAD ANIMAL MORE THAN A KISS FROM ENID\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201coh she\u2019s like, a freak\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u201cPardon me a moment, leeches, we\u2019re here.\u201d Wednesday comes to a stop outside of the large building. The noises from inside are thunderous despite being muffled by stone. The view lowers down with Wednesday, her hands coming up into frame with a lockpick in hand, she quickly gets to work on unlocking the large, iron door.</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cok this is kind of hot, I\u2019m over the deer comment\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cljslijgoesha the fuck man she can actually pick locks??!\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cwhere did this little freak come from?? i want more people like her!!!\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a loud, squeaky click, and Wednesday scoffs as she removes her tools and opens the door. \u201cThat took me twelve seconds, I have gotten rusty, how utterly disappointing I\u2019ll have to break Enid out of the cages more often for practice.\u201d</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cEXCUSE ME 12 SECS IS RUSTY????\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cuuhhhh ummmm ha ha like is Weds an actual criminal???\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201ci mean she did beat the shit out of enid\u2019s ex, i wouldn\u2019t rule out murder\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>The inside of the building is deafening as every werewolf in Nevermore roars and howls at Wednesday as she walks down the rows of cages. The eye shine of beasts hidden away in darkness is the only thing the viewers see of the werewolves; until a clawed hand shoots out between bars and tries to snag Wednesday. The camera view blurs and jostles as Wednesday easily side-steps the hand.</p>\n<p>\u201cApologies leeches, these mutts have no manners.\u201d The camera slowly comes back into focus as Wednesday keeps moving. A few minutes past and then suddenly Wednesday picks up speed, being a beeline for a cage at the very end of the row. \u201cEnid, mia lupa, this place is not fitting for a creature like you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201chey wait a min, how in the fuck is weds seeing in the dark???\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cyeah also how can she tell that is Enid???\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cshe\u2019s gay she would know her gf from a mile away, werewolf or not\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>A low whine rises up from the darkness before a hulking creature finally steps into the range of the night vision. Enid\u2019s tail is wagging fast, her ears perked up, she lets out a few barks as she grips the bars of her cage. Wednesday moves to the door of the cage and makes quick work of the lock, having it open faster than the door to the building.</p>\n<p>\u201cCome on, mia lupa, time for a walk.\u201d</p>\n<p>Enid huffs and grunts, despite her lean build as a werewolf she was still well over seven feet tall, so it took a bit of effort for her to fit through the door. Wednesday takes a few steps back as the werewolf finally makes it through, a few of the werewolves nearby raising their voices in anger in seeing Enid freed. However, Enid quiets them with a rumbling growl, baring her large fangs and snapping at the air once.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>oh i get it now, i see the appeal\u201d</em></p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201csorry guys but sum of us are ENID fans, weds is nice, but give me my sunny werewolf or give me DEATH\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201chow powerful is a werewolf\u2019s bite, asking for a friend\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cdude no i\u2019m pretty sure she could crush your skull with a single chomp\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cHMMM I THINK I GET FURRIES NOW\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>The two roommates hurry out of the building, both of them not wanting to waste anymore of the night. The moment Enid is outside, grass and dirt under her hands and paws, the moonlight soaking into her fur - into her bones, she is gone in a flash, racing off into the woods. Wednesday sighs and follows after at a slow pace.</p>\n<p>\u201cA shame, I had hoped to show you leeches the horrific wonders of Enid\u2019s beastly side, but it seems mia lupa needs to burn off some energy.\u201d</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cthat\u2019s alright, it\u2019s cool just seeing Enid like this for even a moment!\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201coh oh you have her phone!!! take some pics of her!!\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cYES!!! OMG pls take pics of her, Weds! i need more wolf enid!!!!\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u201cHm, I shall, however I will end the stream here. As much as I would delight in recording her killing an animal, I believe her account might be banned if that happens. Have an awful evening, leeches.\u201d With that the stream ends.</p>\n<p><strong>Enid the Wolf @pinkclaws</strong><br>\nShe has trapped me.</p>\n<p>\n<em>The picture is a selfie of Wednesday, staring at the camera with a slight frown and a furrowed brow. The large head of a werewolf, of Enid, lays across the entirety of her torso, nose pressed against Wednesday\u2019s neck. Wednesday has a hand buried in the golden fur between Enid\u2019s ears, and one of Enid\u2019s large, clawed hands is wrapped around Wednesday\u2019s hip. They both lay in the fallen leaves of the forest, the moonlight framing them in a gentle glow.</em>\n</p>\n<p>Enid is many things; bubbly, friendly, and perhaps a bit dense, but she isn\u2019t stupid, nor is she blind. She likes to be optimistic, even when it often leads her down a road to destruction - she cringes as she thinks of her ex girlfriends. However, when it came to her thoughts and feelings and observations of Wednesday Addams - well - Enid may turn a blind eye.</p>\n<p>Everyone teases her, keeps saying she is missing all the signs; but she hasn\u2019t. She has seen every single one, from the start of last year, even the little things that popped up toward the end of freshman year. All the times Wednesday would take her hand, all the times she lets Enid see her with her hair down; the coy smirks and ghostly smiles, sleepy thank yous and every hug after a breakup.</p>\n<p>Enid is many things, and a coward is one of them.</p>\n<p>She runs and runs and runs. She dives into the arms of other women who are dark and charming, pretty and prickly, but their rudeness doesn\u2019t cover a soft and sweet center; they\u2019re just mean, and Enid ends up cutting herself on their sharp edges. It makes her look foolish, it makes her look stupid, it makes her look pathetic; because in the end all those distractions just send her wailing into the arms of the woman she wanted to avoid in the first place.</p>\n<p>And by the moon are her arms perfect; the fit of their bodies pressing together more natural than the rise and fall of the tides. Those rough hands that cradle her face like she\u2019s porcelain. Barded words dulled down to smooth jabs that don\u2019t even leave behind a bruise.</p>\n<p>Enid wants to be so much, and she\u2019s tired of running.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo thanks.\u201d</p>\n<p>The quad seemingly freezes at those two words. The vampire\u2019s eyebrows shoot up toward her hairline. \u201cUh, heh right, I...I don\u2019t think you understood, I\u2019m asking you-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh no, I heard you loud and clear,\u201d Enid flashes a grin that\u2019s nothing but large, gleaming teeth, \u201cI\u2019m just not interested, I don\u2019t even know your name.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s uh, I literally told you two min-\u201d</p>\n<p>Enid brushes past the vampire when she spots a familiar figure of darkness. \u201cWednesday! Wait up!\u201d</p>\n<p>Wednesday instantly stops and turns at Enid\u2019s voice, she nods slightly in greeting. \u201cEnid, are you heading back to the room?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cActually I\u2019m gonna head out to Jericho for dinner, do you want to tag along?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHm, I did skip lunch...very well, do you need anything before we go?\u201d</p>\n<p>Enid hovers her hand by Wednesday\u2019s arm, and once she gets the nod of approval, she latches onto Wednesday\u2019s arm. \u201cI\u2019m good to go!\u201d</p>\n<p>The two roommates leave behind a stunned audience. Enid Sinclair had just rejected a date, the werewolf who was known for being desperate for any girl to ask her out. And she left on the arm of Wednesday Addams, the psychic who was known for dismembering anyone who even accidentally touched her.</p>\n<p><strong>Enid the Wolf @pinkclaws</strong><br>\nget you a man who knows/named every stray cat in your town</p>\n<p>\n<em>A picture of Wednesday, kneeling down and being surrounded by over a dozen cats.

Enid\u2019s computer is on, a live stream is going on, but the werewolf is nowhere in sight. She slowly approaches the desk, her brow furrowed as she looks at the chat.</p>\n<p>\u201cLeeches...where is Enid?\u201d</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201chi Weds!!!!\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cOUR SHORT KING!!!!!\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201chey wednesday, sunday\u2019s stream was crazy hope to see you do more streams!\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cI think Enid said she was going to the bathroom??\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd why is she streaming?

Multi-colored claws lightly scratch at the leather of her jacket, yanking her down into Enid\u2019s desk chair. Wednesday can only grunt as she is spun around and a heavy weight drops into her lap.</p>\n<p>\u201cHowdy there, Mr. Addams.\u201d The words are practically snarled in her ear, hot breath washing over the side of her neck. Enid wraps one clawed hand around the back of her neck, the other lazily trails over her ribs and down to her hip.</p>\n<p>Wednesday\u2019s lungs seize up, blinking rapidly up at Enid whose eyes glowed like the moon, a wolfish - <em>hungry</em> - grin on her face. Enid tilts her head, leans down, and Wednesday inhales sharply when Enid snaps her teeth at the goth.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? No clever remarks? What was it that you said to me awhile ago...oh right! I have claws and teeth and that I should use them next time.\u201d Enid tightens her grip on the back of Wednesday\u2019s neck, watching beads of blood well up around the tips of her claws. \u201cWell, Mr. Addams, I\u2019m using them, got anything to say now?\u201d</p>\n<p>Wednesday\u2019s breathing starts to pick up, her dark eyes smoldering. Enid yelps as Wednesday lurches forward, sending both of them to the floor.</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cAHKAHGAKGHAGA WHAT IS GOING ON?????\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cOMG OMG IS IT FINALLY HAPPENING??!!!!\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cTHEY BETTER BE FUCKING!!!\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201ccan\u2019t tell if Weds is gonna kill Enid or kiss her, maybe both\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>Wednesday is audibly panting now, needle like fangs replacing her canines; the black of her irises bleeding out into her sclera. It should be terrifying - it is terrifying - and yet all Enid feels is heat in her gut and excitement burning in her veins. Wednesday leans down, and Enid rises up to meet her, but she finds a hand around her throat stopping her short.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo more games, Sinclair,\u201d Wednesday hisses, her eyes fully black now. \u201cYou are going to turn off that damn computer, then you are getting in my bed, and I am going to fuck you within an inch of your life, is that understood?\u201d</p>\n<p>Enid rapidly nods, her entire face and neck flushed red. \u201cYes, Mr. Addams.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wednesday slams their mouths together, teeth clicking together and thin fangs catching on Enid\u2019s bottom lip, but the werewolf hardly cared. The kiss ends far too quickly for Enid\u2019s liking, whining softly as she tries to chase Wednesday\u2019s lips. Wednesday just pulls away farther with a low hiss, \u201cyou better stop calling me that if you don\u2019t want to be ravished in front of the leeches.\u201d</p>\n<p>The goth stands up, licking the blood from her lips. She steps over Enid and toward her bed, removing her jacket and tossing it to the side. Enid tilts her head back, watching Wednesday take a seat on her bed, slowly undoing the buttons of her dress shirt.</p>\n<p>Wednesday narrows her blackened eyes, she bares her fangs in a soft hiss. \u201cYou have ten seconds, Sinclair, before I decide to call it a night.\u201d</p>\n<p>Enid is on her feet in a flash, scrambling for her computer.</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cARE U TWO ABOUT TO FUCK!!???\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cDONT LEAVE US HANGING WTF IS GOING ON????\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cFUCKING GET IT ENID THAT\u2019S OUR WOLFY!!!!\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cABOUT TIME HAVE FUN ENID\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>Enid grins, lip bloodied and canines razor sharp, she flashes the viewers a peace sign. \u201cLater losers, I got more important things to do!\u201d</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201clike getting dominated by your new daddy\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, and you wish you were me right now, bye!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em><strong>Enid.</strong></em>\u201d Wednesday barely speaks above a whisper, and yet the sound of her name leaving those lips in a guttural hiss is like a shotgun going off near her ear.</p>\n<p>Enid stumbles forward, drawn in by the siren call, doomed to drown in dark waters. Wednesday lifts up her foot and plants it against Enid\u2019s hip, stopping the blonde from getting any closer. Enid\u2019s brow furrows, her mouth forming a pout as she looks down and then back up at those fully black eyes.</p>\n<p>Wednesday smirks a little, dragging her foot down to Enid\u2019s thigh, and then lets her leg drop away. \u201cYou\u2019re wearing far too much for my liking. Strip.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWh-what?\u201d</p>\n<p>Wednesday cocks an eyebrow, running her tongue over her fangs. \u201cI\u2019ve been waiting for this for two and half years now, I am going to savor our first time together, and that starts with you putting on a little show for me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Enid flushes, heat pooling low, and - <em>of fucking course I\u2019m into this</em> - and with that thought Enid rushes to undress. A light tap against her calf has her pausing with her sweater up and exposing her stomach. Wednesday\u2019s eyes are narrowed in amusement, needle thin fangs peeking out from under her faint smile.</p>\n<p>\u201cSlowly, cucciola, I know you are eager, but we have all night to enjoy ourselves.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSays the one who slammed me onto the floor because I called her mister and sat in her lap.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wednesday scoffs, \u201cwell apologies for my lack of control when the idiot I\u2019ve been flirting with for almost three years finally made a move herself.\u201d</p>\n<p>Enid huffs and crosses her arms, \u201cI didn\u2019t want to mess this up,\u201d she mutters.</p>\n<p>Wednesday\u2019s expression softens, the black receding from her sclera, returning her eyes back to normal. She stands up and closes the distance between them. Enid melts the moment Wednesday cups her face between calloused hands.</p>\n<p>\u201cMia lupa, you have nothing to worry about, I have loved you since the moment we met, and I will love you until my dying breath. Nothing and no one will ever take me from you, you will have me until the day you grow tired of my cloud darkening your sunny sky.\u201d</p>\n<p>Enid throws her arms around Wednesday\u2019s shoulders and pulls her into a feverish kiss. A chuckle rumbles in the back of Wednesday\u2019s throat, her hands sliding down Enid\u2019s neck, over her back, and coming to rest on the werewolf\u2019s hips. Wednesday nips Enid\u2019s bottom lip, smirking at the whimper that escapes the blonde, and she pulls away as Enid starts to tug at her half-open shirt.</p>\n<p>\u201cAh ah,\u201d Wednesday grabs Enid\u2019s hand and shoves them away, \u201cI believe you still owe me a show.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWednesday,\u201d Enid draws out her name in a high-pitched whine.</p>\n<p>The goth simply chuckles again as she backs away and sits back down on her bed. \u201cIf you do good you\u2019ll get your reward, cucciola, now strip for me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Enid takes a deep breath, fidgeting a bit under Wednesday\u2019s intense gaze. \u201cThis is embarrassing,\u201d Enid mumbles, slowly hitching up her sweater inch by inch.</p>\n<p>Wednesday hums, her smirk taking a sharp edge as her eyes follow Enid\u2019s movements. \u201cI believe I have told you once before, that I take immense pleasure from watching you squirm.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>By the goddess.</em>\u201d Enid\u2019s skin was going to permanently turn red at this point from how much she was blushing.</p>\n<p>She pulls off her sweater finally, tossing it aside, and grinning a bit when it lands atop Wednesday\u2019s jacket. Enid looks back to Wednesday, inhaling sharply as the goth unbuttons and removes her own shirt. Wednesday smirks as she throws the shirt to the ground; she rolls her wrist in a silent gesture for Enid to continue.</p>\n<p>Enid slowly pulls down her tights, and then kicks them to the side. She meets Wednesday\u2019s gaze as she undoes the zipper of her skirt and lets gravity take it. Wednesday hums, a familiar note of satisfaction as her dark stare blazes a trail down Enid\u2019s body.</p>\n<p>\u201cUtterly breathtaking,\u201d Wednesday says softly, \u201cyour beauty surpasses all that is unholy in this pathetic universe.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI thought you were gonna kill me with your actions, not your words,\u201d Enid growls low and deep, her body burning more and more as the minutes tick by.</p>\n<p>Wednesday simply smirks, \u201cvery well, come here, cucciola.\u201d</p>\n<p>Enid rushes forward, almost jumping onto Wednesday\u2019s lap, however the goth stills her by grabbing onto her hips. Wednesday shifts further back on the bed, dragging Enid onto her lap once she\u2019s more comfortable. She guides Enid by the hips, encouraging the werewolf to straddle her thigh. Wednesday chuckles as Enid whimpers, her hips bucking and grinding against the goth\u2019s thigh.</p>\n<p>Wednesday leans in, trailing kisses across Enid\u2019s collar bone. Her right hand leaves Enid\u2019s hip, running up her back to deftly undo the clasp of her bra; she quickly removes and tosses aside the piece of lace. \u201cWhat do you want, cucciola? Whatever you desire, you will have it,\u201d Wednesday mutters against Enid\u2019s skin, gently biting the top of her breast.</p>\n<p>She feels that ache again, her fangs wanting to come out once more. Her vision has sharpened already, endless pools of ink taking in every little detail of the blonde in her lap. Enid\u2019s pace picks up, her head tilted back, panting and groaning as she chases her pleasure against Wednesday\u2019s thigh.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnything - fuck, as long as it\u2019s you, I want anything - everything!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI will make your darkest fantasies come true,\u201d Wednesday hisses, her fangs appearing once more. She scraps them lightly across the nape of Enid\u2019s neck, smirking as the blonde jolts, her hips bucking hard.</p>\n<p>Wednesday reaches up, tangling her fingers into short hair, and she tugs Enid down into a heated kiss. Enid moans lowly as a calloused hand grabs her breast and squeezes; Wednesday deepens the kiss the moment Enid\u2019s mouth opens, running her tongue along Enid\u2019s. The blonde grips Wednesday\u2019s shoulders, her nails - no, her claws - tearing into the soft fabric of Wednesday\u2019s sports bra, and Enid quickly pulls away from the kiss hearing the ripping of stems.</p>\n<p>\u201cFuck! Sorry Weds, I\u2019ll buy you-hmhp!\u201d</p>\n<p>Wednesday pulls Enid back in, fangs catching against her lower lip. Wednesday mutters quietly, Enid barely catching words that sound like \u201cdon\u2019t care\u201d before the goth sucks on the injured flesh. Wednesday moves her hands, grabbing Enid\u2019s wrists and placing the blonde\u2019s hands back onto her shoulders; she nudges Enid\u2019s fingers, curling them in against cloth and skin. It hits Enid like a truck, a hot stone dropping low in her belly.</p>\n<p><em>Keep up Enid, this is Wednesday, of course she likes it rough.</em> A deep growl rattles in her chest, the noise humming against Wednesday\u2019s lip, and the goth groans as claws render the rest of her bra and drag across her chest, leaving behind bloody lines.</p>\n<p>Wednesday grabs Enid around the waist, and Enid yelps as she\u2019s suddenly thrown onto her back. Wednesday straddles Enid\u2019s hips, fangs bared in a vicious grin as she reaches up to undo her braids. \u201cI\u2019m warning you right now, if you claw my back, I\u2019m tying you up.\u201d</p>\n<p>Enid whines, wiggling underneath Wednesday; a thin ring of neon blue surrounding her blown out pupils. Wednesday runs her fingers through her hair, gathering the long locks up and tying them into a messy bun before she leans down. She captures Enid into another kiss, however far gentler this time, and only lasting a moment before Wednesday is trailing kisses along Enid\u2019s jaw.</p>\n<p>Wednesday moves down her neck, running her tongue over End\u2019s pulse before latching on. Mindful of her fangs, only biting hard enough to leave marks but not to break skin. Her efforts are rewarded with a loud groan, Enid\u2019s hips bucking up into the air; and she can\u2019t help her smirk as the blonde whines when her flailing meets no friction.</p>\n<p>\u201cWednesday!\u201d Enid groans, jolting and thrusting against nothing as Wednesday plays with her breasts, lining her neck in soft bites.</p>\n<p>Wednesday chuckles, shifting her body lower, placing kisses down Enid\u2019s chest. \u201cGive me a moment, cucciola, let me worship you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Enid huffs, she grabs Wednesday by the shoulders, and the goth grunts in surprise as Enid shoves her lower. \u201cWorship later, I want you to eat me out right now.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wednesday looks up at Enid, blinking slowly in awe, a dull ache throbbing between her legs. \u201cHm, you\u2019re not even going to ask me nicely?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFuck no.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c...\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c...By the fucking moon you\u2019re impossible...Please, Wednesday.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHm, good enough,\u201d Wednesday chuckles lightly.</p>\n<p>Wednesday moves lower and lower, skipping leaving kisses in her wake. She pulls down Enid\u2019s panties, taking the moment to focus, to force away her fangs and ignore the ache that they leave in her gums. She leans back in, biting-<em>hard</em>-into the meat of Enid\u2019s inner thigh to chase away the feeling and deliver a small punishment for the blonde\u2019s snark, but she blinks when Enid moans - <em>loudly</em>.</p>\n<p>Wednesday draws back, blinking up at the werewolf who had a hand now over her mouth. \u201c...Well then, I guess I still have much to learn about you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cJust put me out of my misery,\u201d Enid whimpers.</p>\n<p>\u201cHm, as you wish.\u201d</p>\n<p>Enid gasps as a warm tongue drags through her slick folds. She tries to thrust, to grind against that tongue, but strong calloused hands hold down her hips. Enid whines, and then groans as blunt nails dig into her flesh. Another swipe of the goth\u2019s tongue, and Enid reaches down and tangles her fingers into Wednesday\u2019s hair, keeping her in place.</p>\n<p>Wednesday glances up, drinking in the sight of Enid - chest heaving and eyes shut tightly. She harshly drags her nails across Enid\u2019s hip, down her thigh; the blonde chokes on a gasp that quickly turns to a strained moan as Wednesday circles two fingers around her clit. She runs her fingers up and down Enid\u2019s folds, gathering wetness onto her slender digits before slipping them into Enid.</p>\n<p>Enid throws her head back, slapping her hand over her mouth to muffle the howl of Wednesday\u2019s name that escaped her. The thrusts of her fingers are slow and drawn out, Wednesday taking her pleasure in hearing the pitiful whimpers and desperate pants of the werewolf. The goth reaches up with her free hand and pulls Enid\u2019s hand away from her mouth.</p>\n<p>\u201cStop. I want to hear you clearly.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI-I don\u2019t want other people to hear me!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI will tie your hands together if I must.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re a menace!\u201d</p>\n<p>Wednesday cocks an eyebrow, a slight grin appearing on her lips, and it\u2019s the only warning that Enid gets. The goth suddenly picks up speed, bringing her mouth to Enid\u2019s clit, and everyone in Ophelia Hall surely hears the blonde\u2019s scream as Wednesday sucks on the bundle of nerves. Enid tears her claws across the tops of Wednesday\u2019s shoulders, her thighs clamping around the goth\u2019s head.</p>\n<p>\u201cF-faster! Fuck - Wednesday!\u201d</p>\n<p>Wednesday wraps her hand around Enid\u2019s left thigh, pushing the limb away as she thrusts faster, harder. Enid cries out Wednesday\u2019s name again, her hands scrambling a bit, claws catching against the back of Wednesday\u2019s neck before burying into her long locks, knocking it out its bun. The goth narrows her eyes, huffing through her nose in annoyance as she takes up a brutal pace. She curls her fingers, causing another loud cry from the blonde, and a flutter of her inner walls.</p>\n<p>Wednesday turns her head, kissing along Enid\u2019s thigh, and then when she feels that flutter again, she sinks her teeth in. Enid\u2019s cry catches in her throat, her back arching off the bed. Wednesday slows her pace, easing Enid through her orgasm as she soothes the reddening mark on the pale thigh with soft kisses.</p>\n<p>She pulls out of the blonde, chuckling at the pathetic, little whine that leaves Enid. She doesn\u2019t hesitate to lick her fingers clear, and Enid chokes on air seeing it. Wednesday raises an eyebrow, and Enid waves off her questioning stare.</p>\n<p>\u201cHow...you are...you\u2019re too good at this.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wednesday hums, sitting up on her knees as she reaches down to undo her leather belt. \u201cWell, when you live with a frustrating idiot for almost three years, you learn a few tricks in taking care of yourself.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c...Do...do you have toys?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you really need to ask that? I have a collar with your name on it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Enid\u2019s eyes widened, \u201cis-is that a joke?!\u201d</p>\n<p>Wednesday leans over Enid, the blonde shrinking back a bit as Wednesday never takes her intense gaze off of her. She pulls open the drawer of her nightstand, and brings her hand into view with a thin, leather collar hanging from her finger; a golden tag dangling from it, the name <em>Enid</em> engraved on it as clear as day.</p>\n<p>\u201c...I can\u2019t tell if I\u2019m offended, or extremely turned on...and how long have you had this?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cA year and three months, after you mentioned off-handedly that it was something you wanted to try.\u201d Wednesday drops the collar onto Enid\u2019s chest before straightening back up. \u201cPut it on, cucciola, I still have a few plans for you tonight, and one of them involves a leash.\u201d</p>\n<p>Enid fumbles with the collar, trying to put it on as fast as she can. \u201cAn-and what else do you have planned?\u201d She does her best not to sound overly eager, but she knows she has failed seeing that little smirk on Wednesday\u2019s face.</p>\n<p>Wednesday pulls off her belt, her smirk turning dangerous as she grabs one of Enid\u2019s wrists. \u201cHow about I show you.\u201d</p>\n<p><strong>yokie bear @CountGayula</strong><br>\n<strong>@pinkclaws</strong> hey hey enid super happy for u bro like truly but if i fucking hear u scream addams\u2019s name one more time im gonna kill u</p>\n<p>Enid has fallen asleep only thirty minutes ago; Wednesday stares down at the blonde curled up and tangled in her black sheets. The paleness of her skin standing out against the darkness, soaking in the early morning rays. Wednesday admires every natural little mark, like the freckles that dust her shoulders. However, her dark eyes can\u2019t stop tracing her own work, the indents of teeth that leave beautiful bruises on fair skin. Wednesday licks her teeth, feeling that familiar ache in her gums, but she quickly pushes her desire down; they had just stopped an hour ago, and Enid was not like Wednesday, she needed rest.</p>\n<p>Wednesday loosened her tie a little more, fixing the collar of her dress shirt for the third time; she wanted people to see, but only a peek. She stretches her neck a little and her eyes flutter shut as the scratches on her neck and shoulders pull painfully. She slowly opens her eyes, half-lidded and smoldering. Wednesday reaches out and delicately runs her fingertips over Enid\u2019s calf.</p>\n<p>\u201cI hope you\u2019ll have recovered by the time classes are over, mia lupa,\u201d Wednesday whispers, leaning in and looming over Enid\u2019s peaceful frame. \u201cI hunger endlessly for you now that I finally have had a taste of your flesh.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wednesday hears a metallic bang, and she looks up in time to see the vent on her side of the room pop open. Thing crawls out, pauses at the sight of them, and almost starts scurrying back into the vent, but Wednesday\u2019s sharp command stills the severed hand. \u201cThing, I need you here.\u201d</p>\n<p>Thing scuttles forward, bowing on his knuckles at her feet before signing, \u201c<em>what do you need of me?</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTake care of Enid in my absence, tend to her every need, within reason of course.\u201d</p>\n<p>The hand wiggles his fingers in agreement, \u201c<em>it shall be done, master.</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>Wednesday takes a reluctant step back, sighing heavily as she snatches up her bookbag. \u201cI will be going now, before I\u2019m tempted back into bed.\u201d</p>\n<p>Thing taps a merry little tune, a laugh that makes her heart even lighter. \u201c<em>Be well master, and be aware, there are wolves prowling about.</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>Wednesday stops with her hand on the doorknob, she glances over her shoulder with a small frown. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>I heard stirrings while coming back, the wolf with the broken jaw, her male wolf and his friends hunt for you.</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh? Well then, it seems the spirits of my ancestors have cursed me today.\u201d Wednesday smirks, her eyes bleeding black as a different hunger rises up, her tongue craving the taste of fool\u2019s blood. \u201cWorry not, dear Thing, I will not be the one who strikes first.\u201d</p>\n<p>Thing taps and waves, sending her off with a joyful, \u201c<em>may their agony forever be felt by their descendants!</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>Wednesday steps out, locking the door behind her before she saunters off. She walks past a few other girls of Ophelia Hall, and smirks as they turn their heads away with red cheeks. She can\u2019t help the swagger in her stride, her hand drifting up to the back of her neck to draw eyes to the scabbed over scratches there. They\u2019ll be gone by the end of the day, a woeful fact, but she\u2019ll simply have to have Enid make more later.</p>\n<p>She quickly heads around to Enid\u2019s classes to hand in a sick note for her wolf; she ignores the glare from Professor Horne who clearly smells Enid\u2019s lingering scent on her. After she finishes that she quickly makes her way toward Professor Cross\u2019s office, hoping to speak with her history professor before classes. However, she stops mid-way as she feels a tingling across the back of her skull.</p>\n<p>Wednesday easily side-steps the large fist, twisting sharply as she swings out her leg. She smirks as her heel connects with the side of his knee, delighting in the satisfying crack that rings out. The young man howls out in agony as he crumbles to the ground, cradling his broken leg to his chest. Wednesday\u2019s smirk quickly fades as she doesn\u2019t recognize the werewolf before her.</p>\n<p>\u201cFuck! Ricky, you were supposed to wait!\u201d A booming voice barks.</p>\n<p>Three other werewolves rush up, fangs and claws on full display. Two of them circle around to either side of Wednesday, while the tallest of the group steps forward, snarling down at Wednesday; now this dog she knew.</p>\n<p>Wednesday cocks an eyebrow, folding her hands behind her back. \u201cWilliam Thompson, now isn\u2019t this a sloppy ambush.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAddams, you got a lot to answer for; first my girl, and now my buddy Ricky!\u201d</p>\n<p>Wednesday hums, tilting her head a little. \u201cI believe that is your friend\u2019s own doing, if he hadn\u2019t wanted to get hurt then he shouldn\u2019t have thrown the first punch.\u201d</p>\n<p>Thompson growls, taking a step over Ricky\u2019s prone body. \u201cAnd Zoe? What did she do to deserve a broken jaw?!\u201d</p>\n<p>Wednesday glances; she will say, these dogs were smart enough to corner her without any witnesses, however, that works in her favor as well. \u201cShe hurt Enid.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh you got to be fucking kidding me.\u201d Thompson rolls his eyes, \u201cthat was months ago now, and besides that lone wolf isn\u2019t hurting that much since you\u2019ve got her warming your bed, Addams. Who knew that fucking dyke would open her legs-\u201d</p>\n<p>No one saw Wednesday move; one second she had been standing perfectly still in front of Thompson, the next she wasn\u2019t. Wednesday has her hands wrapped around his throat, feet planted on his chest as she perches over his sprawled-out form on the floor. The two other werewolves blink a few times, their minds processing the scene, and then they scramble to help their leader.</p>\n<p>They go to grab her by the shoulders, only to find her slipping from their grasps with ease. She leaps off of Thompson\u2019s chest and slams a fist against one boy\u2019s jaw. She touches the floor only for a moment before she springs off at the last werewolf and clotheslines him. Wednesday grabs the winded young man and gets him into a chokehold.</p>\n<p>At this point Thompson has recovered, his eyes furious and wild, but they wide in panic when he sees her slowly crushing the other werewolf\u2019s windpipe. \u201cAddams, Addams! Let him go!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy should I?\u201d Her voice is raspier than usual, her needle thin fangs bared. \u201cYou came here to attack me, four against one, why should I show mercy?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFuck, you\u2019re killing him!\u201d</p>\n<p>Wednesday\u2019s tongue flicks out, tasting the fear and rage in the air, and that causes her to pause. She lightens her hold as she catches sight of her hands, black scales - small and thin - run over the top of her fingers and hand, disappearing down to her wrist. This is the most she has ever morphed, and that is a startling thought.</p>\n<p>Wednesday glances back to Thompson, and he flinches under her blackened gaze. \u201cIf I release him, you leave and keep your mouth shut, and mind your tongue, I better not hear you speak of Enid ever again.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah sure, whatever you want Addams, this shit is stupid anyways.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSaid like a true coward.\u201d Wednesday drops the werewolf in her grasp; smirking a little as he cries out in pain when the back of his skull hits the stone floor. She stands up, straightening out her uniform before going over to her dropped bookbag. \u201cAlso,\u201d she steps over to the whimpering form of Ricky, \u201capologies about the kneecap, I thought you were Thompson.\u201d With that she twists on her heel and saunters off.</p>\n<p>She turns off her original path, pulling up her sleeves to get a better look at the scales on her arms. They grew larger and thicker as they ran along her forearm. Wednesday doesn\u2019t hesitate and ripes one of the bigger scales off of her forearm. She studies it with a curious hum, holding it up to the morning light and watching the way it absorbs the sunlight.</p>\n<p>\u201cHm, seems I\u2019ll have to give father a call.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wednesday pockets the scale, and then she fixes her sleeve. She takes a moment to concentrate, and she sighs as she feels her teeth shift, her fangs disappearing as her eyes dull. The scales on her hands sink back into soft flesh.</p>\n<p>Wednesday huffs as she heads off to her class. \u201cWell, this has been a dreadful morning.\u201d</p>\n<p><strong>yokie bear @CountGayula</strong><br>\n<strong>@pinkclaws</strong> u gotta be jking right now sinclair do not tell me u are skipping cuz addams fucked u so hard</p>\n<p><strong>Divy @TheBetterFishTwin</strong><br>\noh leave her alone Yoyo! <strong>@pinkclaws</strong> I hope you feel better soon, Pup!! make sure to eat and drink lots of water!!</p>\n<p><strong>Bia Bar @QueenoftheSea</strong><br>\nHonestly, is she still alive? Has anyone checked in on her? Addams is intense just normally, I\u2019m terrified at the thought of what she\u2019s like in bed, and not even like scared horny.</p>\n<p><strong>yokie bear @CountGayula</strong><br>\nim sorry but u cannot pay me to get anywhere near that fucking room rn</p>\n<p><strong>Divy @TheBetterFishTwin</strong><br>\nOMG you\u2019re such a baby, i\u2019ll check in on Pup rn</p>\n<p>Enid groans as she\u2019s awoken by knocking on the door. Her whole body ached, especially her legs, and definitely <em>in between them</em>. She grunts as she pushes herself onto her elbows, looking around with a slight frown. She was still in Wednesday\u2019s bed, bright morning light shining into the room; a tall glass of water sat on the bedside table with a note next to it. Enid shifts and properly sits up, reaching over with a small groan for the water and note.</p>\n<p>\u201cEnid? Are you alive in there, puppy?\u201d A voice calls out before knocking on the door again.</p>\n<p>Enid perks up, giggling a little at the question. \u201cYeah, I\u2019m good Divy! Just...really sore!\u201d</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a pause, and Enid faintly hears a chuckle on the other side. \u201cWell, I\u2019m glad you had a good time last night. The others were a bit worried, so I came over to make sure you were fine before I head off to classes.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThanks Divy! Sorry for all the trouble!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re fine, pup! I\u2019ll see you tomorrow, if Wednesday doesn\u2019t keep you tied to her bed.\u201d</p>\n<p>Enid flushes, heat coiling in her gut as she remembers last night; Wednesday\u2019s leather belt tight around her wrists, her legs thrown over strong shoulders. \u201cYe-yeah sure, see you tomorrow!\u201d</p>\n<p>Enid gulps down the cool water, hoping to chase away the building heat. She sighs heavily as she sets down the empty glass, and then turns her attention onto the note. She quickly unfolds it and reads it.</p>\n<p>\n<em>My beloved wolf,</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>I am filled with endless sorrow to have left your side, however, matters must be attended to, and so I depart from you. Worry not about yourself, I will take care of notifying your professors of your absence today; I do apologize for being so rough last night, mia lupa, but I couldn't help myself. I wish to ravish you, devour you, destroy you; I wish to see you find rapture by my hands, and my hands alone.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>I lost myself in writing this; I simply wanted you to know that you will be taken care of while I am gone. If you need anything just ask Thing, he will tend to you. I will stop around at lunch time to check in on you myself.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Forever yours,</em><br>\n<em>Wednesday</em>\n</p>\n<p>Enid flops over onto her side, clutching the note to her chest. She turns her head to bury her face against the mattress, and she lets out a scream as she kicks her legs a little. Enid pops back up, panting a bit, \u201cthis is so unfair! She has no right to be so...so...CHARMING! And after last night too!\u201d</p>\n<p>Rapid fingernail tapping draws Enid\u2019s attention to the food, a gasp leaving her chest seeing Thing scuttling over to her with a plate of food carefully balanced on his stubby wrist. \u201cOh my goddess, Thing, thank you so much.\u201d She leans down and takes the plate from him.</p>\n<p>Thing wiggles his fingers before signing to her, \u201c<em>I\u2019m happy to help you, my lady.</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>Enid immediately chokes on the forkful of eggs she just shoved into her mouth. \u201cM-m-my lady?!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Is that too formal? Sorry, I\u2019m a little unsure as to how I should address you now.</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?! Why? Just call me Enid, like usual!\u201d</p>\n<p>Thing taps his index finger a bit in thought, and then he signs. \u201c<em>Well, I suppose I still can, seeing as Master Wednesday didn\u2019t instruct me otherwise, I was just unsure since you are hers now.</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>Enid\u2019s cheeks turn hot, \u201chers? Her what? Girlfriend?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Her wife.</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c...WHAT?!\u201d</p>\n<p>Thing panics a bit, he jumps up onto the bed and waves his hand, \u201c<em>Girlfriend girlfriend! Sorry, I\u2019m an Addams, we\u2019re a bit dramatic.</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>Enid groans as she slumps back against the headboard. \u201cFuck, don\u2019t scare me like that, Thing.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Truly sorry, but truthfully, there\u2019s not much of a difference between a girlfriend, and a wife in the Addams family. One simply allows you to legally carry around the last name Addams.</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI-I - we\u2019re still a bit too young to get married, Thing!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>So you wish to marry her?</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI - well - I mean, I\u2019d have to be an absolute idiot to let her go now!\u201d</p>\n<p>Thing slaps his hand lightly against the bed, laughing. \u201c<em>I don\u2019t think the young master will let you go now that she has you.</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>Enid ducks her head, a shy smile blooming onto her face. \u201cThat\u2019s...nice to know.\u201d</p>\n<p>Thing wiggles a bit, excitedly signing, \u201c<em>can I be the flower hand at your wedding?</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>Enid giggles, \u201cThing, you can be the flower hand and the ring bearer.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>How awful! I cannot wait to tell Master Wednesday!</em>\u201d</p>\n<p><strong>Enid the Wolf @pinkclaws</strong><br>\nEnid Addams, I\u2019m really liking the sound of that</p>\n<p><strong>yokie bear @CountGayula</strong><br>\nshe fucked u one (1) time calm down</p>\n<p><strong>Divy @TheBetterFishTwin</strong><br>\nOOOOO!!

She hears the jovial laugh of her father, he has always delighted in her work. \u201cMy little viper! Oh how I have missed your dreaded visage!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt is woeful to see you as well, father, just give me a moment.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course! Tell me, what are you making, my viper? Something tortuous, or horrific?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNeither, I\u2019m making the worst thing possible.\u201d</p>\n<p>Gomez gasps, a hand clutching at his chest. \u201cNo, it can\u2019t be true!\u201d</p>\n<p>Wednesday nods, finally glancing up at her father with a smile, a truly horrid sight. \u201cI\u2019m afraid it is the truth, father, I\u2019m making something <em>romantic.</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>Gomez screeches like a dying car, fire and smoke bursting to life around his frame. \u201cMy darling viper! In love! Oh how cruel this world is to have your mother, my beloved wife, gone at this time! She needs to know of this grim news right away!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPlease calm yourself father before you set the manor on fire, again.\u201d</p>\n<p>The fire sizzles out, but smoke still clings to his body, billowing from his mouth and pouring out from under his clothes. \u201cTell me it is the wolf you lament about every time you come home? Have you finally confessed your undying love?!\u201d</p>\n<p>Wednesday stills briefly, a faint redness taking her ears. \u201cIt was...not a confession per se.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWednesday! Do not tell me you skipped proper etiquette and went right for the kill!\u201d</p>\n<p>Wednesday huffs, her eyes blacken into a deadly glare. \u201cDo not scold me, you weren\u2019t any better at my age; actually, you were younger and much worse than I, you took mother to bed within the hour of meeting her.\u201d</p>\n<p>Gomez holds up his hands, a sheepish grin on his face. \u201cAlright, you got me there.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHowever, you are right, and that is why I am making up for that,\u201d Wednesday turns her gaze back to her gift. \u201cI will drown her with my affection, burn her alive with my love, she is my treasure and I will treat her like my finest gem in my horde.\u201d</p>\n<p>Gomez leans forward slightly, his eyes narrowing as he studies his daughter. \u201cWednesday...have you...changed since this development of your relationship?\u201d</p>\n<p>Wednesday pauses, and then with a nod she holds up her little project; a black scale, shaped into a heart, with a name slowly being etched into the steel hard surface. \u201cThree days ago I grew scales, and my tongue became snake-like. What is happening to me? I thought I could only shift my eyes and teeth.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, my little viper, you are simply just growing, it happens to every Addams when they find love.\u201d Gomez brings his hand into view, palm up, and a small fireball bursts to life. \u201cBefore I met your mother, I could only summon embers and spit wisps of smoke from my mouth, but now-\u201d He grins, teeth becoming razor sharp as horns curl from his forehead, his skin turning a hellish hue. \u201cShe has made me into a true devil.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wednesday rolls her eyes, but she can\u2019t help the fond narrowing of her eyes. \u201cShould I expect...changes in my emotional behavior?\u201d</p>\n<p>Gomez shifts back, nodding solemnly as he pulls out a cigar. \u201cYou have been cursed with dragon blood, seen so little these days in our family; Pugsley has his wolfish nature, and Pubert takes so much after me, being a little devil himself.\u201d He lights his cigar with a snap of his fingers, takes a few puffs of it, and blows out a skull shaped cloud. \u201cI cannot say for certain what might happen to you personality wise, Wednesday, however I can give you a bit of advice.\u201d</p>\n<p>Gomez points his cigar at her, \u201cbe honest with Enid, tell her about this, secrets do not help in a relationship, unless it is a fun or romantic surprise of course.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Wednesday nods in agreement.</p>\n<p>Gomez grins as he bites onto his cigar, \u201cmy daughter-in-law deserves the best just like my daughter, and if you do not deliver on that, I will kill you!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI expect nothing less, and welcome death by your hands father if I am ever to fail and disappoint Enid, all I ask is that you use the rapier I gave you when I was twelve.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI had that blade in mind! One of my favorites!\u201d Gomez laughs, smoke billowing from him in rings.</p>\n<p>Wednesday preens a bit, \u201cthank you for speaking with me, father, I will continue to notify you of any changes of my person, be it physical, or mental.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCall whenever you wish to, my little viper - oh! And do not forget to tell Enid that I\u2019ll be coming over this Saturday for our duel!\u201d</p>\n<p>Wednesday nods, \u201cI will tell her when she comes back, have a horrible evening, father.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI hope someone attacks you this evening!\u201d</p>\n<p><strong>Enid the Wolf @pinkclaws</strong><br>\nUHHH GOOD NEWS: ME AND WEDS HAVE A DATE TOMORROW!!!</p>\n<p><strong>Enid the Wolf @pinkclaws</strong><br>\nBAD NEWS: I HAVE A FORMAL DUEL WITH HER FATHER THIS SAT????</p>\n<p><strong>Bia Bar @QueenoftheSea</strong><br>\nYou see, this is usually a red flag with anyone else, but this is Addams we\u2019re talking about; this is probably peak romance for them.</p>\n<p><strong>yokie bear @CountGayula</strong><br>\nactually i know this tradition that is some serious bullshit right there ur pretty much married to addams at this point</p>\n<p><strong>former slender @ArtorArtist</strong><br>\noh shit ur going 2 fight gomez??!!!

She got ready a bit early, to surprise Wednesday when she got back. Enid twirls, giggling as the skirt of her dress fans out. She wore one of her favorites, bright pink with baby blue flowers embroidered on the hem of the skirt and long sleeves. She has a sunny yellow sweater thrown over for the cold weather outside, and has put on pink and white striped thigh highs to cover up the lingering bruises.</p>\n<p>She\u2019s not ashamed of them, not by a long shot; however, Wednesday eyes her up every time the bite marks are in sight, hunger burning in her gaze. She would have never guessed that Wednesday \u201cdon\u2019t touch me\u201d Addams had such a crazy sex drive.</p>\n<p>Enid perks up as two raps sounded on the door before it was opened. Wednesday steps in, blazer thrown over her shoulder and tie undone around her neck. Her dark gaze immediately finds Enid, trailing over the blonde\u2019s frame slowly before jumping up to meet her eyes.</p>\n<p>\u201cApologizes for the wait, Professor Valentine has been trying to bargain with me to tutor some students of hers.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd how is that going?\u201d</p>\n<p>Wednesday throws her blazer onto her bed, undressing at a rapid pace. \u201cBoring, she refuses to give me her soul, nor will she allow me the right to maim anyone I tutor if they get on my nerves.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWednesday...\u201d</p>\n<p>The goth huffs, a small frown on her face as she glances at Enid. \u201cMy time is precious, if I am to waste it on imbeciles then I want something worth my time, or be allowed to torture them.\u201d</p>\n<p>Enid shakes her head, a fond smile on her lips. \u201cYou know I love you so much, but man you can be such an asshole sometimes.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wednesday freezes up, her eyes slightly widening; and Enid flushes bright red when she realizes what she just said. Enid goes to say something, anything, but she yelps as she finds herself suddenly being slammed against her desk. Wednesday kisses her like this is their last moments alive.</p>\n<p>Enid melts into the kiss with a soft groan, her hands coming up to cup either side of Wednesday\u2019s jaw. A tongue traces along her bottom lip, and Enid opens her mouth to eagerly accept that wicked, talented tongue. Enid could kiss Wednesday forever, however, she doesn\u2019t have impressive lung capacity like her girlfriend. The blonde pulls away with huffing breaths.</p>\n<p>Wednesday smirks, her mouth smudged bright pink from Enid\u2019s lipstick. Enid giggles and wipes at Wednesday\u2019s perfect cupid\u2019s bow with her thumb. \u201cGo get cleaned up, lover boy, we have a date remember?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t ever forget, mia lupa,\u201d Wednesday catches Enid\u2019s thumb with a kiss, her dark eyes never leaving Enid\u2019s. \u201cI wish to say one thing before I go.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd what\u2019s that?\u201d</p>\n<p>Wednesday leans in, pressing Enid even further against the desk as she whispers against her lips. \u201cI love you too.\u201d</p>\n<p>The goth goes to draw back, Enid grabs her by the shoulders and pulls her into another kiss - gentle, brimming with warmth and affection. Enid pushes against Wednesday with her hips, and the smaller girl takes a step back, but their lips stay locked as Wednesday slowly guides them to Enid\u2019s bed.</p>\n<p>\u201cI love you,\u201d Enid whispers, dragging Wednesday down onto the colorful covers of her bed.</p>\n<p>\u201cI love you,\u201d Wednesday snarls softly, thin fangs pressing against Enid\u2019s mouth.</p>\n<p>Enid clears her throat as she walks beside Wednesday, hugging her girlfriend\u2019s arm tight against her torso. They were totally not late to their dinner reservations; and Enid totally didn\u2019t have to fix her lipstick during the drive over here because she forgot to do it back at their dorm in their haste to leave. Wednesday\u2019s eyes dance with silent laughter, her free hand resting over one of Enid\u2019s forearms.</p>\n<p>When they reach the door Wednesday pulls away from Enid and opens the door for her, bowing slightly at the waist. Enid pauses before she passes, she swoops down and lays a grateful kiss against Wednesday\u2019s cheek, quickly skipping away to dodge those grasping hands. Wednesday huffs and grumbles as she falls into step with the blonde.</p>\n<p>Wednesday had bought out one of the ritzier restaurants in Jericho for the night; with the amount of money she is spending, and the utterly destroying glance she bestowed upon the host, none of the staff raise any complaints about their late arrival. They\u2019re led to the middle of the main room to a table seated for two, the lights have been dimmed, and two lit candles set the romantic atmosphere. Wednesday pulls out Enid\u2019s seat and tucks it back in once the blonde has sat down.</p>\n<p>\u201cBy the moon, Weds,\u201d Enid whispers, her cheeks rosy and her smile dreamy. \u201cThis is the best date I\u2019ve ever been on.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt has hardly started, mia tesoro.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, but that doesn\u2019t make it any less true.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wednesday huffs, she rests her forearm out on the tabletop, turning her hand palm up; she curls her fingers in small grabbing motion. \u201cFools, every single last one of them, they don\u2019t know how rich they were to have your attention.\u201d</p>\n<p>Enid lays her hand in Wednesday\u2019s, whining quietly as the goth raises her hand and places kisses onto Enid\u2019s knuckles. \u201cYou\u2019re so lucky we\u2019re in public right now,\u201d Enid growls lowly.</p>\n<p>\u201cActually I would say that\u2019s quite unfortunate for me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Their waiter comes over soon enough with their drinks, and Enid raises an eyebrow as only Wednesday is served the red wine and she\u2019s left with sparkling water. \u201cHow...?\u201d</p>\n<p>Wednesday takes a small sip of her wine, humming softly as her nose wrinkles slightly. \u201cI made sure to place our orders ahead of time, and I know you do not care for alcohol, though I do not know how you can enjoy that bubbly water.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh my goddess, shut up it\u2019s good!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHm, I\u2019ll take your word for it, mia lupa.\u201d</p>\n<p>Enid rolls her eyes, but then she smiles sheepishly as she glances toward the kitchen. \u201cNow I feel worse about being late to our reservations.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI do not.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s because you\u2019re a ravenous beast who cares so little for others.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wednesday\u2019s irises spill out like tar onto white sand, a low purr rumbling up from her chest as she smirks with fangs. \u201c<em>Mia lupa</em>, be careful with that mouth, your flattery will be your doom.\u201d</p>\n<p>Enid sinks down in her seat a little, groaning as she covers her hot face. \u201cYou\u2019re impossible.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wednesday covers her smile with another sip of her drink. \u201cAnd yet you love me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI do,\u201d Enid sighs, dropping her hands and smiling tenderly.</p>\n<p>\u201cSit up, our food is here.\u201d</p>\n<p>They eat mostly in silence, Wednesday muttering here and there and taking pleasure in the sight of Enid\u2019s blushing cheeks in the candlelight. The goth finishes her meal first, much to Enid\u2019s surprise who isn\u2019t even half-way through her food. Wednesday wipes her mouth with her napkin before standing up from her seat.</p>\n<p>Enid stills, blinking owlishly up at her girlfriend. \u201cWeds? Where are you going?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI wish to provide you with some music while you finish your meal.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, uh, thanks? What did you like bring a radio or-\u201d Enid almost chokes on the piece of steak in her mouth when Wednesday lifts her cello case from its hidden place. \u201cYou brought your cello?!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut of course, only the best for you, mia tesoro.\u201d Wednesday grabs her chair and places it a few feet from the right of the table. She opens the case, pulls out her cello and bow, and quickly settles herself down into the chair. Wednesday smirks at Enid as she brings the bow up to the strings and begins a haunting melody.</p>\n<p><strong>Enid the Wolf @pinkclaws</strong><br>\nI love my little dragon &lt;3</p>\n<p>\n<em>The picture is of Wednesday playing her cello against a blurry and dim background. Her gaze pointed just above the camera to stare unwaveringly at the photographer. The sleeves of her black dress shirt are rolled up to the elbow, the red tie undone around her neck. The flame of a candle reflected in her black eyes. Her smile is faint and adoring.</em>\n</p>\n<p><strong>Enid the Wolf @pinkclaws</strong><br>\nwish me good luck, fight with Papa Addams tomorrow, im ready to die UwU</p>\n<p><strong>yokie bear @CountGayula</strong><br>\ni got 50 on addams\u2019s dad</p>\n<p><strong>former slenderman @ArtorArtist</strong><br>\n100 on DILF Addams</p>\n<p><strong>Bia Bar @QueenoftheSea</strong><br>\nAlso 50 on Addams\u2019s father, I know for a fact Addams learned from her father; Enid is done for.</p>\n<p><strong>ASnake @snakes_have_legs</strong><br>\ny\u2019all so mean 2 my homie TvT</p>\n<p><strong>beeboy @HelloBees</strong><br>\n200 on Enid</p>\n<p><strong>Enid the Wolf @pinkclaws</strong><br>\nAHFKSHAFKAGA EUGENE???!!!!!</p>\n<p><strong>Black Butterfly @dustywings</strong><br>\n1,000 on my princess, she\u2019s going to destroy that old man</p>\n<p><strong>Enid the Wolf @pinkclaws</strong><br>\nHOLY FUCKING SHIT PLS TELL ME THATS A JK IM BEGGING YOU BB</p>\n<p><strong>Bia Bar @QueenoftheSea</strong><br>\n<strong>@dustywings</strong> Who in the fuck are you?

Wednesday stands right beside her, holding Enid\u2019s hand the whole ten minutes they\u2019ve been waiting for Gomez Addams. The goth feels Enid\u2019s fidgeting with the steel ring on her thumb; Wednesday blows a small bubble of her black gum, before popping it with a sharpened canine.</p>\n<p>\u201cCan I have some gum?\u201d</p>\n<p>Wednesday raises an eyebrow, \u201cit\u2019s licorice flavored.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI really don\u2019t care,\u201d Enid whimpers softly, \u201cI need to chew on something.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cVery well, don\u2019t choke on it.\u201d Wednesday takes out a stick of the black bubblegum, and Enid eagerly shoves it into her mouth.</p>\n<p>Enid\u2019s nose wrinkles at the taste, but chews on the gum nonetheless as she goes back to playing with Wednesday\u2019s ring. \u201cDo I have to really duel him?\u201d</p>\n<p>Wednesday sighs as she nods, \u201cit\u2019s all formality, Enid, a tradition from the old days when us Addams were hunted by humans and supernatural creatures; it was important to know if our partners could not only protect themselves, but could protect us as well. However, it\u2019s now just for fun, there\u2019s no need to be so nervous, my father will not disapprove of you if you lose against him, though I do not think you will lose.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut-but what if he doesn\u2019t like me?!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThen I will gut him, and as heir I will take over as Head of House and have you immediately added to the records of my family.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWednesday!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut he does not hate you; he has already started calling you his daughter-in-law and has threatened my life if I ever displease you.\u201d</p>\n<p>This does not help. Enid instantly bursts into tears and starts wailing, \u201ch-h-he th-thinks of me a-as his daughter!\u201d</p>\n<p>Wednesday sighs as she pulls out her handkerchief and wipes away Enid\u2019s tears; why must everyone in her life be so overly emotional. \u201cFather and you will get along swimmingly, like fire to a forest; he\u2019ll think you disgustingly bright and take utter delight in your puppy-like personality.\u201d</p>\n<p>Enid sniffles lightly, swooping in fast to place a salty kiss against Wednesday\u2019s mouth; she pulls back slowly with a watery smile. \u201cReally? He...he won\u2019t think I\u2019m-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<strong><em>Enid</em></strong>,\u201d Wednesday hisses, her irises melting into the whites of her eyes. \u201cMy family adores you; I have talked about you for three years now, have sung endless praises in your name, we might as well be married at this point with how often they have called you my wife.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wednesday grunts as Enid suddenly crushes her into a hug. \u201cI\u2019m gonna kick your dad\u2019s ass and then take you out onto a date!\u201d</p>\n<p>Wednesday rolls her eyes, but she melts into Enid\u2019s embrace as she wraps her own arms around the blonde\u2019s waist. \u201cI'd rather you take me to your bed.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWednesday, love of my life, you need to <em>chill</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c...Apologies, that is another aspect of my biology we should speak about at another time.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWait, what? You\u2019re telling me your insane sex drive is because of your <em>biology?!</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>Wednesday clears her throat lightly, not acknowledging the warmth in her cheeks. \u201cYes - well - as I said, my family had been hunted down like dogs in the past, and we are the byproduct of many inter-species couplings...My desire to breed with you is always at the forefront of my mind and it is maddening.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBREED?!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh look, my father is here.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWednesday Friday Addams, we are not done talking about this!\u201d</p>\n<p>A familiar hearse comes speeding down the road toward them. Wednesday takes a few steps back and pulls Enid along with her. Enid lets out a tiny scream as the hearse screeches to a halt, stopping just a few inches from hitting them. The driver side door opens, and out steps a tall, undead looking man that shouldn\u2019t have fit inside the car; he nods to Wednesday, letting out a low groan.</p>\n<p>\u201cHello Lurch, it is awful to see you as well.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lurch takes one large step to the back of the car and opens the door. A wall of smoke pours out from the car, jovial laughter ringing out loud as the devil himself steps out. Gomez Addams grins wide and devious, his teeth gapped, crooked, and <em>sharp</em>; dressed in a black and white pinstripe suit, a cigar in hand and the other holding onto a beautifully crafted cane. Gomez walks toward the two girls with his arms open wide.</p>\n<p>\u201cMy little viper! And the darling wolf herself!\u201d Wednesday tries to dodge the hug, but Enid grips hard on her hand and pulls the goth right into it. Gomez peppers Wednesday\u2019s cheeks with kisses as he squeezes the two tight in his arms.</p>\n<p>Wednesday snarls, her lip curling back to bare thin fangs, and Gomez coos at the sight of them. \u201c<em>That.</em> Is enough father,\u201d Wednesday slams her fist right into his gut.</p>\n<p>Gomez wheezes out a laugh, immediately letting go of Wednesday and Enid. \u201cYou\u2019ve gotten stronger! I told you Nevermore would be dreadful for you!\u201d</p>\n<p>Wednesday huffs, crossing her arms as she glares at her father. \u201cYou tell me that every time I come home. Enid, this is my father, Gomez Addams.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cA pleasure to finally meet you, Enid,\u201d Gomez said as he held out his hand; Enid took his hand into a firm handshake. \u201cEnid, would you do the honor of marrying my daughter?\u201d</p>\n<p>Enid blinks rapidly, \u201cdid you just...propose for Wednesday?\u201d</p>\n<p>Wednesday grabs Enid\u2019s arm and yanks her away from Gomez as she stomps down onto her father\u2019s foot. \u201cIndeed he did, which <em>I do not need your help with, father,</em>\u201d the goth hisses. \u201cYou can go back home right now if your only goal is to simply be a nuisance.\u201d</p>\n<p>Gomez bows his head a little in apology, \u201cforgive your ever eager father, my little viper, I will refrain for now.\u201d Gomez places and holds his cane under his arm, he puts out the end of his cigar against the back of his hand before putting it into the breast pocket of his jacket. \u201cNow then, where shall the duel take place?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBy the lake, we\u2019ll need the room, and the water in case you start a fire,\u201d Wednesday said.</p>\n<p>\u201cFantastic! Let us be off!\u201d</p>\n<p>For a moment the only thing the viewers see is a blurry shot of a lake, until the camera is zoomed out until it focuses. Wednesday comes into view suddenly, she adjusts the camera a bit so it\u2019s pointed down a little more. She steps back with a satisfied nod, and a voice speaks up - close to the camera but out of sight.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy do I have to wear this?\u201d The person grumbles.</p>\n<p>\u201cBecause you are freakishly tall, so the view will be better from you,\u201d Wednesday said plainly, moving out of view of the camera.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m only six-one...\u201d</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cYO WEDS OUR KING!!!!\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cdude it\u2019s been so long since we last had a stream!!!\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201chey isn\u2019t Enid like fighting your dad today???\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u201cHello leeches...Xavier, turn toward me, you imbecile.\u201d</p>\n<p>The cameraman - Xavier - sighs loudly as he turns, revealing a field packed with young adults; many have laid out blankets on the grass, or are sitting in foldable chairs. Wednesday has Enid\u2019s phone in hand, and she gestures for Xavier to follow her as she starts to move through the crowd.</p>\n<p>\u201cCorrect you are, leech, my beloved will be dueling my father in a few minutes.\u201d</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cOH SHIT WE GET TO WATCH THE DUEL!!!!!\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201c\u2018my beloved\u2019 i\u2019m gonna throw up that\u2019s so cute\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cok is no one else finding this really fucked up?\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u201cI understand that many of you leeches must be human, and do not read your own history, so allow me to explain.\u201d Wednesday comes to a stop, a large space has been left open near the edge of the lake; and there everyone can see two figures stretching. \u201cDuels have been a part of cultures, human and creature, for centuries; often issued to defend one\u2019s honor, but for some people they were crucial when it came to courtships.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d Xavier speaks up, \u201cwhile duels might not be really practiced these days, especially for humans, they\u2019re still a huge part of supernatural cultures, like Nes\u2019s family.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t call me that in front of the leeches.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSorry...\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHowever, duels in my family have long since lost their original purpose in the courtship process, now it\u2019s just for fun.\u201d</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201coh wow Enid wasn\u2019t jking u are a huge history nerd\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cNES OMG WHY DIDNT WE THINK OF THAT NICKNAME SOONER\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cdoes Enid ever call you Nessie???\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cthank god the duel is just for fun, i thought we were about to see Enid\u2019s death\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u201cLook at what you\u2019ve done,\u201d Wednesday hisses, whipping around to shove the phone into Xavier\u2019s face.</p>\n<p>\u201cFuck, sorry Wednesday.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI am fine with Weds, but not <em>this</em>, they will torment me now.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI SAID SORRY!\u201d Xavier\u2019s hands come up into view, held up in a surrendering motion.</p>\n<p>Wednesday snarls quietly, \u201csorry isn\u2019t good enough, I\u2019m taking a finger.\u201d</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201coh man, RIP camera dude\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cwho is this dude anyways???

Good luck kiss - wait, is that my phone? And - ARE YOU STREAMING THIS?!\u201d</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cHI ENID!!!!\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cU GOT THIS WOLFIE!!! WEDS DAD GOT NOTHING ON U!!!!\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201coh shit, did Enid not know this was being streamed???!!!\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>Enid growls, she turns Wednesday around sharply and grabs the shorter girl by the collar of her shirt. \u201cWe are having a big talk later, mister.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI understand, mia lupa,\u201d Wednesday said with a faint smirk. She places a hand on the back of Enid\u2019s neck and drags her down into a heated kiss. The view suddenly turns away, Xavier clearing his throat awkwardly.</p>\n<p>\u201cUh, streaming, remember?\u201d</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a long pause, and then a soft whine; and Xavier turns back to reveal a pouting Enid, and Wednesday with pink smeared across her mouth. \u201cI am well aware, however, I don\u2019t care.\u201d</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cagkahfajkshga Weds is so hot it should be illegal\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cEnid can i marry ur gf, pls im begging u\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, fuck off she\u2019s <em><strong>mine!</strong></em>\u201d Enid growls, her eyes glowing neon bright.</p>\n<p>Wednesday pulls Enid into another hungry kiss, but ends this one a lot faster than the first. \u201cIndeed I am, mia tesoro.\u201d</p>\n<p>Enid grins, she presses a quick kiss to Wednesday\u2019s temple. \u201cMy little dragon,\u201d Enid purrs, planting a few more kisses to Wednesday\u2019s face. \u201cOkay okay, I wish I could stay and kiss you forever, but I gotta go kick your dad\u2019s ass, love you!\u201d</p>\n<p>Enid skips away, leaving behind a slightly disheveled Wednesday; her face covered in pink lipstick marks and the collar of her t-shirt torn a little by claws. The goth narrows her eyes, \u201cnot a word.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t gonna say anything.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNot you, <em>the leeches.</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>A roaring laugh draws everyone\u2019s attention. Enid and Gomez are now standing face to face with only about ten feet between them. Gomez has removed his suit jacket, and Enid just finished taking off and tossing aside her pink coat. The werewolf is tying back her short hair into a half ponytail, while Gomez unsheathes the hidden blade of his cane, his smile wide and manic.</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cim too bi for this\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cIS THAT WEDS\u2019S DAD??!!!\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cI wish he was my daddy\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>Gomez gives a deep bow at the waist to Enid, straightening back up he gives a little twirl of the sword and then points the tip at Enid. \u201cPlease, do not hold back, my dear wolf, none of my children have ever gone easy on me, and I carry a scar from each of them with pride!\u201d</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cOH HE IS DADDY!!!!\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cNOW THAT\u2019S A DILF\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201csuddenly everything about Weds makes sense\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cguys guys what does this mean about Weds\u2019s mom???\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201coh fucking god no, her mother, im so scared\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cis everyone in this goddamn family hot goths???\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>Enid snarls - her teeth lengthening, becoming too big for her human mouth. She crouches low, claws extending as fur grows along her exposed arms and shoulders. There are a few low cracks as her body grows a little wider, a little bigger, a little more wolfish. The glow of her eyes like moonbeam; and she tilts her head back and lets out a bone-rattling howl.</p>\n<p>Wednesday smirks, \u201cthat\u2019s my wife.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDude, you\u2019re so gay.\u201d</p>\n<p>The fight lasts ten minutes, and it\u2019s the most Wednesday has ever seen her father bleed. Enid is fast, her razor-sharp claws catching Gomez on the arms and legs, but her father simply laughs like a madman as he returns the hits. They\u2019re evenly matched and for a moment it seems the duel will only end from exhaustion rather than a fatal blow; until Enid gets a hold of Gomez.</p>\n<p>With her strength, it is easy for the werewolf to lift Gomez over her head; and then toss him into the lake. Wednesday groans as she takes off her leather jacket and shoves it into Xavier\u2019s arms along with Enid\u2019s phone. \u201cPardon me, I must go save my father.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe can\u2019t swim.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOH SHIT!\u201d</p>\n<p>An hour later finds them in their dorm room; Gomez\u2019s hair is still slightly damp, and he is wearing a bright blue sweater patterned with fluffy white clouds. Enid is seated in front of the computer, now streaming from it, and Gomez is nodding along excitedly as Enid explains what a YouTuber is.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo yeah, that\u2019s about it! I mainly record makeup videos, but it\u2019s really nice to stream here and there, and be more connected with my viewers and stuff, cause ya know, they\u2019re my friends!\u201d</p>\n<p>Gomez grins widely, \u201cthat is amazing, my dear wolf! I am not surprised so many love you, you are an easy person to love after-all, even my cold, heartless, darling viper fell for you!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI am in the room, father, and I know where every weapon is in here.\u201d</p>\n<p>Enid ducks her head down, her face bright red. \u201cOh, I don\u2019t know about that, I just...I imagine me being a werewolf helps, and you know there\u2019s Wednesday...I got really popular after she popped up in my stream.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDo <em>not</em> devalue yourself by using <em>me</em>, I will skin you alive, Sinclair.\u201d</p>\n<p>Gomez nods, \u201cI agree with my darling viper, it is unfair to you, and to her.\u201d</p>\n<p>Enid inhales sharply, she shoots up from her chair and races over to Wednesday, and tackles the shorter girl into her bed. \u201cOh my moon, I\u2019m so sorry!\u201d</p>\n<p>Gomez cackles as the couple rolls around on the bed; Wednesday trying to push the werewolf away, while Enid tries to cover the goth in sloppy kisses. The Addams man looks at the computer screen, and his head tilts slightly as he reads some of the comments coming in.</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cso sir, do you have any embarrassing stories of Weds??\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cOMG YES!!! what was Weds like as a kid?!!\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cPLEASE!!! you have to tell us!!!\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>Gomez takes a seat in the desk chair, a sly smirk on his face as he hums gleefully in thought. \u201cEmbarrassing stories of my little viper, my oh my...there are far too many to choose from!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNO!\u201d Wednesday springs up from her bed lightning fast, Enid falling to the floor with a loud yelp and thud. \u201cIf you wish to keep your tongue you will stay silent, old man!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOr perhaps, she can embarrass herself by giving Enid her gift...\u201d</p>\n<p>Wednesday gasps, and then hisses loudly as her eyes turn black. \u201cTraitor! How dare you expose me in front of those leeches!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cA gift?\u201d</p>\n<p>Wednesday looks down to Enid, who is still sprawled out on the floor. \u201cI...it...it was supposed to be a surprise...after the duel, and after my father had left...\u201d</p>\n<p>Enid scrambles up from the floor, bright smile blinding, \u201ccan I have it now?!\u201d</p>\n<p>Wednesday points a withering glare at Gomez, and then with a huff she stomps over to her desk. \u201cWell, there\u2019s no reason to hide it any longer since <em>someone</em> spoiled the surprise.\u201d She roughly pulls open the left top drawer and takes out a small, thin box; she marches back over to Enid and holds it out. \u201cHere, if you cry, I am leaving the room.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo you won\u2019t.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c...Just open your gift.\u201d</p>\n<p>Enid opens the small box, and her eyes widen seeing the black, heart-shape scale against the white silk. She lifts it by the thin, platinum chain it hangs from; <em>Enid</em> engraved on the front of the scale. The blonde looks back up at Wednesday, her vision blurring with tears.</p>\n<p>Wednesday sighs as she opens her arms, \u201cI said no crying.\u201d</p>\n<p>Enid buries herself into Wednesday\u2019s arms, sniffling softly as she presses her face into Wednesday\u2019s neck. \u201cI love you so much.\u201d</p>\n<p>The goth goes to reply, when she hears a different sniffle of tears, and she groans when she looks over to her father. \u201cNot you too.\u201d</p>\n<p>Gomez sobs quietly, dabbing at his tears with a handkerchief, \u201cI-I am just so happy for you two, my darling daughters!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI am not inviting you to the wedding.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHey leeches! I know I know, I should be packing right now, but I really wanted to do one more stream in the dorm room before summer break!\u201d</p>\n<p>Enid flashes her bright smile, slowly twirling around in her desk chair. It\u2019s almost been ten months since she started streaming, and eight months since she started dating her best friend and roommate, Wednesday Addams. If you had told her at the beginning of the school year that she would have over one hundred thousand fans, and would be dating the love of her life; well - she\u2019d probably faint to be honest.</p>\n<p>Enid pauses in her spinning when she catches the look that Wednesday sends her. She sighs as she fully turns back to the camera and pulls herself closer to the desk. \u201cAnd since you guys have been dying for this since Weds first showed up, we\u2019ll be doing a Q and A for Wednesday!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAgainst my will, I might add,\u201d Wednesday finally speaks up as she moves into frame, dragging her chair over from her own desk. \u201cHello leeches, I hope you all have been suffering.\u201d</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cour king and queen!!!\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201chey ladies, hope y\u2019all been doing good!!\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cOOOOO Q&amp;A!!! do we get to ask questions live?!?!!!\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u201cSadly, no,\u201d Enid said with a grin, \u201cWeds demanded that she pre-pick ten questions for the stream, sorry guys.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wednesday places her chair close to Enid\u2019s before sitting down. \u201cI\u2019d rather drink sewage than have these idiots ask me personal questions.\u201d</p>\n<p>Enid giggles, she leans over and presses a kiss against Wednesday\u2019s cheek. \u201cThat\u2019s valid.

Her upper lip curls back as her thin fangs drop down from her gums, a forked tongue flicking out for a brief moment to taste the air. Black scales push through her flesh, running up the sides of her neck and over her jawline, up the bridge of her nose and spreading over her brow.</p>\n<p>\u201cThose born of my father\u2019s blood end up as wicked things; Pugsley is a wolf, Pubert a fiend like our father, and I...I am a dragon.

Then there will be Pubert\u2019s birthday, and toward the end of the summer there is the family reunion which will be...overwhelming, to put it lightly. There are other smaller happenings throughout the summer months, but those will be the three main events.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhich reminds me!\u201d Enid said with a gasp, slapping Wednesday\u2019s knee a few times, \u201cI\u2019m so excited to see the bog beast hunt!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTruly? My brothers and I get quite filthy during that one, I am sure the smell will be unpleasant to a werewolf.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh totes, no doubt about it, but I wanna see what in the hell a bog beast is!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThen I will be sure to win this year and bring back the wretched creature just for you, mia lupa.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAwe, my little dragon, you\u2019re so sweet to me!\u201d Enid cups Wednesday\u2019s face and pulls her into a quick, but eager kiss. \u201cSo!
