  "text": "<p>Marinette wasn\u2019t an idiot. As many precautions as she insisted they take, she knew she and Chat Noir were both going to find out sooner or later. Occupational hazard and all that.</p>\n<p>She sort of assumed that, if the time ever came, they\u2019d deal with it calmly and rationally. Their jobs were serious \u2014 lives were at stake everyday and their ability to function together while keeping each other safe was paramount.</p>\n<p>Of course, Marinette assumed that the way they\u2019d find out wasn\u2019t by running right smack into each other in the hallway after a battle and detransforming in front of each other.</p>\n<p>Marinette had seconds left on her transformation and swooping into one of the hallways she knew would be empty during this period, quickly letting her transformation fall, and sprinting back to class would be the best cover for her. She\u2019d done it dozens of times.</p>\n<p>Of course Chat Noir had the same idea and Marinette didn\u2019t have the time to blink before they collided foreheads, flew into the air, and landed painfully on their backs.</p>\n<p>They were both rubbing their foreheads and wincing in pain, but it was too late because Marinette was staring at Adrien and Adrien was staring at Marinette and the cat was officially out of the bag.</p>\n<p>So of course, in a typical calm and rational manner, they pointed to each other and screamed.</p>\n<p>Marinette slapped her hands over her mouth, and Adrien immediately reached up to cover his eyes.</p>\n<p>\u201cI didn\u2019t see anything!\u201d he said frantically, his voice cracking in panic. \u201cI didn\u2019t see! I didn\u2019t see! I swear!\u201d</p>\n<p>She almost appreciated the effort, but Marinette already knew it was too late. Tikki was hiding in her purse and she briefly saw a black blur zip into Chat\u2019s \u2014 Adrien\u2019s, <em> wow </em> \u2014 shirt pocket that must have been another kwami. Plus, she <em> saw </em> him let his transformation fall. It was way too late.</p>\n<p>\u201cChat,\u201d Marinette began tiredly. \u201cI mean, Adrien. I mean \u2014 \u201d Crap, this was going to be so hard to get used to. \u201cIt\u2019s done, you can open your eyes.\u201d</p>\n<p>Adrien swallowed. \u201cAre you sure?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah. I\u2019m sure.\u201d</p>\n<p>Adrien slowly lowered his hands and Marinette was looking straight into his eyes, seeing all of his fear and uncertainty reflected back at her and taking in all of the little things about him that suddenly had an entirely different context this time. The hair, the height, the shape of his jaw, the ring on his finger, the dimple on his chin. They all matched up and it was like some strange veil had suddenly been ripped off because everything was clear, so so clear and so unmistakable.</p>\n<p>And she panicked.</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay, never mind, I\u2019m not sure, I take it back!\u201d</p>\n<p>She stood up and turned her back to him, raking her fingers through her hair and feeling her heart racing. There was no way she could just smash these two people together. No way. This wasn\u2019t happening. This was crazy. There was no way both of them could\u2019ve possibly been this oblivious.</p>\n<p>Marinette whirled around and faced him again. \u201cQuick. Tell a pun.\u201d</p>\n<p>Adrien squinted. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cA pun. Just tell one. Any one.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI can\u2019t just give a pun out of the blue at a time like this!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p>\n<p>Adrien scoffed, as if the answer were obvious. \u201cBecause there are situational factors that all go into proper pun delivery, and none of them are being met at the proper levels.\u201d He lifted one finger. \u201cFor one thing, the mood in the room is too filled with conflicting emotions for the punch line to be appreciated properly. Second \u2014 \u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh my God, never mind,\u201d Marinette groaned. \u201cThat was proof all on its own.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, you asked! Wouldn\u2019t you rather I confirm it?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo!\u201d Marinette said. \u201c...yes. I don\u2019t know\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAlright,\u201d Adrien sighed out, jumping up in place a little to shake himself of his nerves. \u201cOkay. Okay, okay, okay, okay.\u201d</p>\n<p>Marinette looked at him desperately. \u201cOkay, <em> what? </em>\u201d</p>\n<p>Adrien dropped his shoulders and frowned pathetically. \u201cI have no idea. I mean, I know we always talked about this happening, but I didn\u2019t think it would <em> actually </em> happen. And I...didn\u2019t think it\u2019d be. Well. You.\u201d</p>\n<p>Marinette was tapping her fingers against her temples and heard the tell tale sounds of students coming up from their gym classes to head back into the library. She sighed out in frustration, grabbed Adrien\u2019s wrist, and tried to find an empty classroom. \u201cCome on. We need to figure this out.\u201d</p>\n<p>Adrien looked over his shoulder. \u201cWe still have class.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ll worry about that later.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe have to go learn!!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI think we\u2019ve learned enough today, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p>\n<p>Adrien opened his mouth, closed it, and nodded. \u201cAlright. Valid.\u201d</p>\n<p>One of the science classrooms wasn\u2019t going to be open for another hour, and Marinette figured that would be enough time to get themselves sorted. She closed the door behind her and pressed her back into the knob as she watched Adrien lean against one of the lab tables and face her, keeping his arms crossed and jiggling his legs. She nibbled on her lip and slid her finger along the clasp of her bag. \u201cTikki,\u201d she muttered. \u201cI guess you can come out now.\u201d</p>\n<p>Tikki\u2019s head poked hesitantly out of Marinette\u2019s bag, and she looked around the large classroom until her eyes landed on Adrien. She floated out, sat herself down on Marinette\u2019s shoulder, and waved carefully. \u201cHello, there Adrien.\u201d</p>\n<p>Adrien blinked as if he were in a daze and waved back slowly. He nudged his wrist against his shirt until a small, black creature came spiraling out of his shirt.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh perfect, we\u2019re going through <em> this </em> thing again. Honestly, it gets so dull after the billionth time.\u201d He floated in front of Marinette and sighed irritably. \u201cPlagg. Nice to meet you. Now can we hurry this up, I\u2019m starving!\u201d</p>\n<p>Tikki floated up in front of him and glared. \u201cStop that! This isn\u2019t something they should be rushing. This is a stressful situation for the both of them, don\u2019t make it worse.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh it\u2019s not that big a deal, so they found out! They\u2019re going to be better off, and you and I both know that.\u201d</p>\n<p>Tikki sighed. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean this is easy for them to digest.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI never understood why this was always so complicated,\u201d Plagg complained. \u201cThey saw it with their own eyes. Pure evidence. It\u2019s not like that\u2019s going to change anytime soon. Just move on with it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThis is shocking for them!\u201d</p>\n<p>Plagg blinked. \u201cSo what are we supposed to do? <em> Un</em>shock them?\u201d</p>\n<p>The classroom was ringing in silence for a few minutes before Adrien lifted a tentative finger as if he were afraid of interrupting. \u201cUm, sorry, hi. Could we\u2026?\u201d He gestured vaguely between himself and Marinette. \u201cJust fifteen or so minutes?\u201d</p>\n<p>Tikki turned to Adrien, looking apologetic, and nodded. \u201cOh, of course. You probably need to be alone for a bit. Will you be okay, Marinette?\u201d</p>\n<p>Marinette nodded, not having moved from her place against the door. \u201cYeah, I think so.\u201d</p>\n<p>Plagg turned to Adrien and tapped him on the nose. \u201cLook. Just rip the bandaid off, kid. Sort this out quick.\u201d</p>\n<p>Tikki grabbed one of Plagg\u2019s arms and dragged him over to one of the open classroom windows. \u201cIgnore him. We\u2019ll just...we\u2019ll be over here.\u201d</p>\n<p>Their kwamis zipped off out of sight and left Marinette and Adrien standing only a few feet across from each other, still scrutinizing each other, piecing things together, and trying to make complete pictures in their head. Almost as if they\u2019d read each other\u2019s minds, they both slid down, sat cross-legged on the floor, and let out identical sighs.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo\u2026\u201d Marinette began awkwardly. \u201cYour kwami seems...nice?\u201d</p>\n<p>Adrien snorted. \u201c<em>Your </em> kwami seems nice. Mine just likes to get to the point. Helps him get fed quicker.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe looked like he was trying to help.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIn his own way, I guess.\u201d</p>\n<p>The only thing they could really hear was the clock ticking on the wall and Marinette was suddenly having a hard time trying to come up with something to say. It didn\u2019t seem like anything was substantial enough to fill up the space, and the two of them were eft with this strange, uncomfortable heaviness that they\u2019d never had to deal with before. Talking to Chat was like breathing, and even talking to Adrien was charged with a completely different brand of discomfort that had more to do with her own insecurities and less to do with not knowing where she stood with someone else.</p>\n<p>Adrien must have felt the same way, because it looked like all his nerves had finally bubbled up to the surface and resulted in a desperate sort of laugh that just escaped out of his throat without him meaning to. It sounded so\u00a0forced that Marinette couldn\u2019t help but chuckle in response. Adrien started smiling at her and suddenly he was bending forward at the waist and laughing harder than Marinette had ever seen him laugh in her life. Maybe it was the wrong place and the wrong time, but she started laughing right along with him and felt the anxiety\u00a0start to untwist and release itself\u00a0just a little bit.</p>\n<p>Neither of them knew what was so funny, but pretty soon they had tears in their eyes, their chests were aching, and every time their laughter fell off, they\u2019d make eye contact and start it back up again. Adrien leaned back against one of the lab stools and suddenly felt it slide back behind him until he fell back and knocked his head on the ground behind him. It left Marinette so overcome by her laughter that she had to crawl onto her hands and knees and try to find her breath again before she hurt herself.</p>\n<p>Adrien was wiping at his eyes with one hand and rubbing the back of his head with the other. He shrugged helplessly. \u201cWell...this is awkward.\u201d</p>\n<p>Marinette nodded in agreement and placed a hand on her chest to calm her breathing. \u201cYeah. Definitely awkward.\u201d She paused for a moment and giggled to herself.\u00a0\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever heard your voice crack like that before,\u201d she smirked, referring to his initial reaction in the hallway. \u201cDoes it crack when you panic?\u201d</p>\n<p>Adrien frowned. \u201cYou\u2019re being <em> furry </em> mean to me. Please be <em> mice</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay, <em> now </em> we\u2019re in the proper conditions for a cat pun?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHey, I don\u2019t make the rules, Marinette. This is a delicate art. The timing was <em> purr</em>fect.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh come on, at least come up with something original.\u201d</p>\n<p>Adrien gave her an affronted look. \u201cExcuse me, my Lady,\u201d he said, sounding so similar to Chat Noir that Marinette almost wanted to cry. \u201cI am absolutely ap<em>paw</em>lled by your <em> claw</em>ful <em> cat</em>titude.\u201d</p>\n<p>She raised a brow. \u201cThree. In one sentence. You\u2019re ridiculous.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat still hasn\u2019t beat my record though. I\u2019m waiting for the day where I can actually smash six of them into one sentence.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWasn\u2019t the last one seven?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWait, really? Which one was that?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou think I actually remember? You pulled it out of your hat at the end of a battle, it\u2019s a miracle you didn\u2019t rehearse it beforehand.\u201d</p>\n<p>Adrien grinned and relented the point. He looked at Marinette again and shook his head. \u201cStill awkward?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cJust a little,\u201d Marinette chuckled. \u201cI kinda...don\u2019t know what we\u2019re supposed to do now. I mean, we can\u2019t just go outside and head to class and pretend everything is normal. Can we?\u201d</p>\n<p>Adrien blew air out from between his lips and tapped his fingers against his knee. \u201cWelp,\u201d he said, popping the \u2018p.\u2019 \u201cProbably not. But that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean it\u2019s going to be like this forever. Change always happens, and you just gotta get used to it. There\u2019s nothing else <em> to </em> do.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo just...wait it out and see what happens?\u201d Marinette asked. \u201cThat\u2019s kinda vague.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m kinda playing this by ear, to be totally honest,\u201d Adrien said. \u201cI\u2019m not the best at planning things.\u201d</p>\n<p>Marinette grinned. \u201cYeah, that\u2019s for sure.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnyway,\u201d Adrien ignored her with a smile. \u201cThis might be one of those things that we have to take one step at a time.\u201d He took a deep breath. \u201cExcept that they\u2019ll probably be really big, really wide steps.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cRight,\u201d Marinette said, more to convince herself than anything else. \u201cRight, right. I mean, we should be fine, right? How complicated could this be?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ll be fine!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah!</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cRight\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>They stared at each other in silence, shoulders tensing again.</p>\n<p>Marinette spoke first. \u201cThis is going to be a mess, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p>\n<p>Adrien smiled nervously. \u201cProbably.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGreat.\u201d</p>\n<p>The moment they walked back into class, Marinette had this strong, paranoid feeling that everyone else in their class just <em> knew</em>.</p>\n<p>Apparently that\u2019s what happened when you were suddenly holding double the secrets you were before. It felt like they were spilling out of you and everyone could just see it.</p>\n<p>Adrien and Marinette were both scolded when they finally arrived for the last fifteen minutes of class, and were given late slips for their parents to sign and bring back the next day along with double homework for the night. It made sense logically that their entire class would be staring and making muttered comments at their expense. This happened to Marinette every time she was late, and she was far too used to it.</p>\n<p>But the fact that Adrien \u2014 Adrien Agreste, love of her life, perfect, wonderful, and lovely \u2014 was <em> Chat Noir </em> this entire time was still knocking around in her head and putting her in this strange daze that made it feel like the entire world was tipped on its edge. Everyone\u2019s stares felt like they were going right through her, reading her paranoia like a book. Like they knew exactly what she was agonizing about and were actually tittering about it behind books and hands.</p>\n<p>Adrien wasn\u2019t doing any better than she was, and she heard him audibly swallow while he clutched his late slip in his hands and stared worriedly out at the rest of the class, unable to move his feet or even remember to take a breath. Marinette shoved a subtle elbow in his side that seemed to surprise him, because he jumped almost a foot into the air and had to shake his head a little bit before he sobered up, and plopped down in his own seat.</p>\n<p>Marinette thought for a second that she was at least being a little bit cooler about it, but she completely didn\u2019t see one of the steps in front of her and face planted on the floor by her desk, earning the laughter of her entire class before miserably slinking back to her own desk</p>\n<p>Oh yeah. They were looking <em> awesome </em> right now.</p>\n<p>Marinette wasn\u2019t even bothering with looking down at her tablet to take notes. She was too busy staring at the back of Adrien\u2019s head and trying to figure out <em> how! </em></p>\n<p>The puns! Terrible and corny and irritating just like Chat\u2019s were. Coming out of Adrien\u2019s mouth!</p>\n<p>The sudden stiff and inelegant way he walked back to his seat because he was so self conscious because that\u2019s how <em> Chat </em> acted when he was self conscious.</p>\n<p><em> Oh God! </em> she realized in a sudden panic. <em> I\u2019ve been crushing on Adrien. Adrien is Chat Noir. So does that mean I\u2019ve been crushing on \u2014 </em></p>\n<p>Marinette damn near slammed her head on her desk. Wow. No. Not finishing that thought. Too soon. Way too soon.</p>\n<p>It was like dealing with a third completely different person. Adrien and Chat Noir acted so differently, and learning that they were just two different shades of the same person made Marinette feel like she had to completely wipe her slates clean and start over with figuring this new hybrid version of Adrien Agreste out.</p>\n<p>How was she even supposed to be doing that? She was kind of just working towards asking him to the movies this week. Now she had to deal with all of <em> this? </em> How was that at all fair?</p>\n<p>Everything she thought about Adrien had suddenly shifted somehow \u2014 her crush on him, her admiration for him, her idolization of him, everything. It wasn\u2019t a bad shift, just a different one. It was layered on with all of her feelings towards her partner, and now she had to sort out what that meant for them now.</p>\n<p>She risked a look at the board in front of the room and groaned. Crap. Quiz on Monday. Her notes were empty. This was just fantastic.</p>\n<p>Luckily enough, it was their last class of the day. Marinette could just head straight home, blast through all of her extra homework, and spend the weekend under her covers dying. The last part sounded especially tempting right about now. But before she had a chance to rush out the classroom, Nino turned in his seat to look at Marinette. \u201cSo?\u201d</p>\n<p>Marinette hugged her bag to her chest and darted her eyes to the side, hoping Nino wasn\u2019t talking to her. \u201cSo...what?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou and Adrien were gone for a while,\u201d he elaborated. \u201cWhat the hell were you two up to \u2014 \u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNothing!\u201d Adrien blurted out a little too loudly. \u201cNothing, nothing, why would you, ah...haha...why would you think we were up to something?\u201d</p>\n<p>Alya leaned over her desk to look at the both of them. \u201cI mean, you guys just jetted out of here out of nowhere so we thought something was wrong.\u201d</p>\n<p>Damn. Marinette completely forgot about that. The akuma had popped up so suddenly they didn\u2019t even bother to come up with an excuse before sprinting out the classroom.</p>\n<p>\u201cRight!\u201d Marinette blurted out. \u201cSomething wrong! You think something is wrong...ooooookay.\u201d Between the akuma attack and their little...erm...<em> mishap </em>...they\u2019d been out of class for over an hour. She supposed a bathroom break wasn\u2019t a good enough reason this time around. But she was totally blanking on what to say.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, <em> is </em> there something wrong?\u201d Alya asked. \u201cYou both looked a little off when you came back in.\u201d</p>\n<p>Marinette tried to quickly flounder around for a good enough excuse. \u201cUm! There is! I mean, there was! Uh\u2026.Adrien you want to tell them what\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p>\n<p>He turned to look up at her in confusion. \u201cSomething\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes!\u201d Marinette smiled forcefully, speaking through gritted teeth. \u201cSomething\u2019s wrong, we ran out of here during class, remember?\u201d</p>\n<p>Adrien frowned at her for a second before her desperate stare made his eyes widen in realization. \u201cRight!\u201d he recovered quickly. \u201cYeah, uh. So uh\u2026.we...\u201d He trailed off for a moment, fiddling with the straps of his school bag. \u201cThere was a reason! A good one, too.\u201d He bit his lip and cleared his throat loudly. \u201cMarinette you want to tell them the good reason?\u201d</p>\n<p>Marinette clenched her hands in her lap and leaned over her desk to bring her face closer to his. \u201cNo, Adrien,\u201d she muttered dangerously. \u201c<em>You </em> tell them the reason.\u201d</p>\n<p>But he looked helpless sitting there with Alya and Nino staring at the two of them like they were crazy and whispered to her behind his hand. \u201cNo, seriously Marinette, you need to tell them the reason.\u201d</p>\n<p>Alya leaned back in her seat and scowled. \u201cOkay, what the heck is up with you two? You\u2019re acting super weird.\u201d</p>\n<p>Adrien made a strange drawn out noise from the back of his throat while he held a hand to his forehead, staring at Alya and Nino in outright panic while his brain was desperately willing their cogs to start turning and come up with words to say. \u201cThat\u2019s because uh\u2026\u201d His eyes darted to Marinette for a quick moment before he bit his lip. \u201cMarinette wasn\u2019t feeling well?\u201d</p>\n<p>Nino blinked. \u201cWait, is that all?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re sick?\u201d Alya said worriedly, reaching over to press her hand to Marinette\u2019s cheek.</p>\n<p>Not the best excuse, but it was all they had and Marinette decided to run with it. \u201cYeah! Super sick, uh\u2026food poisoning!\u201d she decided victoriously. \u201cYeah, I had really...bad food poisoning.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMust have been that cafe we went to this afternoon,\u201d Adrien continued, trying to catch visual cues from Marinette to see if he was doing well. \u201cGuess that\u2019s what you get for going to new places, huh?\u201d</p>\n<p>Nino frowned and shifted in his seat. \u201cBut we all ate the same thing, shouldn\u2019t we all be sick?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSensitive stomach!\u201d Marinette insisted loudly. \u201cUnlucky day. What can I say?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, tell me about it\u2026\u201d Adrien muttered quietly, but Marinette suddenly shoved a painful thumb in his shoulder. \u201cI mean, uh! Yeah. She was sprinting out of here so quickly I thought it\u2019d be best to help her out a little. So I helped her over to the nurse\u2019s office.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh you poor thing, no wonder,\u201d Alya cooed. \u201cAre you feeling better?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, yeah,\u201d Marinette said offhandedly. \u201cJust needed to go rest in the nurse\u2019s office for a bit.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou should tell Madame Bustier on Monday that you were just in the nurse\u2019s office,\u201d Nino explained. \u201cMaybe you guys can get out of all your homework.\u201d</p>\n<p>Unlikely, but they both nodded encouragingly. \u201cWe\u2019ll...be sure to do that,\u201d Adrien promised.</p>\n<p>Alya turned to Adrien and smiled warmly. \u201cWell that was nice of you to take her to the nurse\u2019s office,\u201d she told him. \u201cYou two really sped out of here, it must have been pretty bad.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, it was kinda bad,\u201d Adrien kept saying. \u201cNeeded help big time, I mean wow! Just throwing up everywhere, looking terrible, retching in the hallway. It was a lot.\u201d</p>\n<p>Marinette winced and clicked her tongue against her teeth. \u201cOkay,\u201d she grumbled, burying her face in her hand. \u201cYou really didn\u2019t need to tell them that much\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>Adrien frowned. \u201cToo much?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cToo much.\u201d</p>\n<p>Alya was already standing up from her seat and moving out of the row. \u201cGeez, next time tell people what\u2019s wrong and where you\u2019re going instead of spooking everyone and running out of here like a bat out of Hell.\u201d</p>\n<p>Marinette slid out her seat and started slowly inching her way down the steps, intent on making a quick exit to avoid anymore scrutiny. \u201cYeah, I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019ll make sure to do that. I didn\u2019t mean to make you worry.\u201d</p>\n<p>Nino patted Adrien on the shoulder. \u201cThanks for helping her, man. That was real cool of you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Adrien shrugged and tried to smile casually. \u201cWell you know me. I can\u2019t just see someone in trouble and not try and offer help, you know?\u201d</p>\n<p>Alya leaned her chin on Marinette\u2019s shoulder and smirked at him. \u201cScooping up damsels in distress,\u201d she teased. \u201cHow very Chat Noir of you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Marinette didn\u2019t mean to freak out \u2014 honestly she didn\u2019t. But the minute the words came out of Alya\u2019s mouth, she sucked in a huge, sharp breath and accidentely started choking on her own spit until she was coughing loudly and uncontrollably, shaking Alya from her shoulder and trying not to start dry heaving in the middle of the empty classroom.</p>\n<p>Adrien swooped in quickly and wrapped an arm around her shoulder. \u201cLook at that!\u201d he cried out frantically, his voice cracking again under pressure. \u201cI think Marinette\u2019s sick again! I\u2019m gonna take her back to the nurse now.\u201d He started yanking her down the steps and towards the door of the classroom. \u201cWe\u2019ll uh...see you guys tomorrow! Text you later?\u201d</p>\n<p>Nino looked absolutely and thoroughly confused. \u201cUm...sure? But hey are you two really okay?\u201d</p>\n<p>Neither of them had the time to answer Nino and instead decided to book it out of the classroom and down the hall before anymore questions were flung their way. Marinette was fully intent on just running all the way home and wallowing in her stupidity in private, but Adrien was already grabbing her wrist and dragging her up the stairs in the courtyard, through a couple of double doors, and into the library that was completely empty for the weekend.</p>\n<p>He moved them over to one of the private study rooms in the corner of the library and shut the door behind him before he turned on her and furrowed his brows. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t make that anymore obvious!?\u201d he hissed.</p>\n<p>Marinette scoffed rudely and pointed to herself. \u201c<em>Me!? </em> You can dangle from 500 and something meters in the air, stare death in the face, and come up with jokes out of thin air, but you can\u2019t scramble around for a better sounding excuse than me upchucking in the hallway?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cStop calling my skills into question!\u201d Adrien said, sounding rather affronted. \u201cI couldn\u2019t think of a better reason. I\u2019m bad under pressure\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>Marinette grabbed her hair. \u201cYou fight crime! What do you mean you\u2019re not good under pressure?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThis is social pressure!\u201d Adrien whined. \u201cIt\u2019s different! Besides you literally asphyxiated on your own secret back there, you\u2019re just as bad.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI was caught by surprise!\u201d she said defensively. \u201cI\u2019m still not totally over\u2026\u201d She gestured to Adrien\u2019s entire body. \u201cWell, you know.\u201d</p>\n<p>Adrien let his shoulders slump. \u201cMe neither\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>It\u2019s not like neither of them weren\u2019t used to keeping secrets like this. The day after her first mission as Ladybug, it felt almost good to keep such a big secret to herself. It was like Marinette was in on a private joke. Besides, Tikki had made it incredibly clear to her that she wasn\u2019t meant to let anyone know about her secret identity, and Marinette was more than happy to shoulder that responsibility and take it seriously. There wasn\u2019t any need to be strange or uncomfortable about it because it was an important duty, just like purifying akumas and keeping Paris safe was just an important duty. It seemed like Adrien had been keeping his own secret perfectly shut up as well without any troubles.</p>\n<p>But now they were both floundering around and acting completely ridiculous like their secrets were too big for them to keep quiet, like they were just begging to scream them out to everyone just to stop the pressure from building up. Accepting the mantle of Ladybug wasn\u2019t filled with all of this confusion and uncertainty, and she didn\u2019t realize how much space all of that turmoil could take up. At the rate they were going, they were going to \u00a0reveal themselves on accident if they didn\u2019t start getting used to the idea that Marinette and Ladybug weren\u2019t disparate, and neither were Adrien and Chat Noir.</p>\n<p>Marinette sighed and slumped back into the chair behind her. \u201cI think we need to have a part two of our chat. We\u2019re not doing too hot right now, in case you haven\u2019t noticed.\u201d</p>\n<p>Adrien grabbed the chair behind him, turned it around, and straddled the back of it, leaning his forearms on the edge. \u201cWell, what else are we supposed to do?\u201d he asked. \u201cI mean, we know already. It\u2019s weird and surprising and shocking, but we can\u2019t stop it from being all of those things.\u201d</p>\n<p>Marinette lifted her feet on the chair and hugged her knees to her chest. \u201cNo, but the more we talk about it, maybe the easier it\u2019ll be to swallow?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat makes sense,\u201d Adrien mumbled into his arms. \u201cBut I thought we did all the talking. We were good a few minutes ago. I mean, yeah, things were off but.\u201d He groaned. \u201cI thought it\u2019d be easier than this.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMaybe we just think we talked about everything,\u201d Marinette said. \u201cI mean, is something still bothering you?\u201d</p>\n<p>Adrien flitted his gaze down to the floor and started pulling on one of the loose threads of carpet with the sole of his sneaker. \u201cSort of,\u201d he admitted quietly. \u201cYou?\u201d</p>\n<p>Marinette pressed her mouth against the fabric of her jeans. \u201cYeah\u2026\u201d She shrugged her shoulders helplessly. \u201cMaybe Plagg was right,\u201d she explained. \u201cJust rip the bandage off all at once. Talk about what\u2019s bothering us and just get everything out.\u201d</p>\n<p>Adrien snorted. \u201cWe\u2019re following Plagg\u2019s advice? Yeah, we\u2019re doing great\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCome on,\u201d she chuckled. \u201cWe won\u2019t know if it\u2019ll help if we don\u2019t try.\u201d</p>\n<p>Adrien nodded, hesitated for a few seconds, and jutted his chin towards Marinette. \u201cShortest goes first.\u201d</p>\n<p>Marinette glared at him. \u201cWe\u2019re not lining up for gym, you dummy! You go first.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou have so many secrets in that tiny body, you have to get them out first before you explode.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay, now you\u2019re being silly.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m stalling, I don\u2019t know what to say!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, don\u2019t think, just say what comes to mind.\u201d She smirked at him. \u201cI don\u2019t recall you have issues with that before.\u201d</p>\n<p>Adrien rolled his eyes and smiled behind his arms. \u201cYou just love poking fun at my character flaws, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p>\n<p>Marinette giggled. \u201cYou make it too easy.\u201d</p>\n<p>Adrien tilted his head to the side and stared at the wall of the study room while he tapped his toes rhythmically against the carpet. \u201cI\u2019m afraid that we\u2019re going to drift apart.\u201d</p>\n<p>He said it so honestly and so vulnerably \u2014 like he was truly\u00a0scared of his own admission \u2014 that Marinette\u2019s chest tightened at the sound of his voice. \u201cWhy would you think that?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI dunno,\u201d he started. \u201cIt\u2019s just that\u2026.I\u2019ve never really gotten to know you \u2014 Marinette \u2014 before. I mean, you\u2019ve always been really nice and helpful, and you\u2019re such a talented person. And we\u2019ve hung out a few times. But there\u2019s a lot about you I don\u2019t know. And then there was Ladybug \u2014 and she was always this perfect image in my head, like a dream I couldn\u2019t touch. I admired her, and I loved everything that Ladybug stood for because she made me want to be better.\u201d</p>\n<p>He took his hands in front of him and laced them together. \u201cBut now that you\u2019re both their same person it\u2019s like...well, it\u2019s like I don\u2019t really know either of you that well,\u201d he admitted. \u201cLike because I don\u2019t know much about Marinette, I know less about Ladybug than I thought I did. Both of you together just make up this bigger, more complicated picture of the girl I sit in front of and the girl I save lives with. And it\u2019s just confusing because I don\u2019t even know where that leaves us now. What if\u2026\u201d He cleared his throat and dared to peek his eyes up at her. \u201cWhat if this changes everything?\u201d</p>\n<p>It was a valid worry, and one that Marinette had been entertaining as well. Once you mixed A and B together, you were stuck with C and there was no way of getting A and B back exactly like they were before. It stood to reason that there may be a small possibility that what came after the merging would be something less appealing than the parts you started with. Marinette knew how much Chat Noir liked Ladybug, but it always seemed obvious to her that Adrien only really saw Marinette as a classmate, the girl that sat behind him in class. What did that mean to learn that she was both of those people, that she wasn\u2019t two separate ideas, that she was both someone to idolize, and someone to just smile kindly at in class? Would Adrien suddenly think less of her, suddenly become less enthused by her?</p>\n<p>Chat Noir, the silly, obnoxious, loyal partner she\u2019d always treated with an exasperated sort of familiarity, was also the same person that she couldn\u2019t bring herself to form a single sentence in front of. She herself didn\u2019t know what that changed. It made talking to Adrien easier already, but her crush felt useless now \u2014 this Adrien sitting in front of her wasn\u2019t the same Adrien she\u2019d seen in class yesterday.</p>\n<p>So what did all that mean?</p>\n<p>\u201cI know how you feel,\u201d she finally said after a prolonged silence. \u201cI feel the same way. We sort of have to relearn each other a little bit. We have all these parts and it\u2019s time to fit them together into a complete piece.\u201d She crossed her ankles and smiled at Adrien, waiting for him to lift his head and see it. \u201cBut, I think this might actually be a good thing. It just means we understand each other better. Like we\u2019re finally getting the full story.\u201d</p>\n<p>Her heart was beating nervously, but she pushed the rest of the words out. \u201cMaybe things are strange, and we have a lot that we need to get used to. But the fact that we\u2019re partners hasn\u2019t changed. I still trust you with everything I have, despite all this. I can\u2019t think of anyone else I\u2019d rather fight next to. You\u2019re such an important friend to me,\u201d she said determinedly. \u201cThat\u2019s still true. And that\u2019ll never stop being true.\u201d</p>\n<p>Adrien beamed at her and laughed into his arms in what looked like sweet relief. He was showing all of his teeth, smiling in that uninhibited way that Chat Noir liked to do, and Marinette suddenly felt a strong wash of affection for him that had nothing to do with her crush on Adrien. They\u2019d been fighting alongside each other and trusting their lives with the other for close to a year. That kind of closeness didn\u2019t go away. That kind of friendship didn\u2019t just dissolve because of something silly like finding out their identities.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat makes sense,\u201d Adrien admitted. He scooted his chair closer and reached over to grab one of Marinette\u2019s hands in his own. Her heart only did a slight jump when their skin made contact, but she was too focused on Adrien\u2019s stare and Adrien\u2019s words. \u201cI hope I didn\u2019t do anything to make you think otherwise. I mean, I know this was jarring and that we were both still trying to get used to all of this, but...I\u2019m happy it\u2019s you,\u201d he sighed in relief. \u201cI\u2019ve always thought you were such a nice, good person. So this is good. And I\u2019m not disappointed.\u201d</p>\n<p>That made her heart swell, and she felt so relieved she didn\u2019t even bother hiding her warm cheeks from him. \u201cI\u2019m happy it\u2019s you too.\u201d She squeezed his hand back. \u201cWe\u2019re still partners. We can get through this, I know we can. It\u2019s just a little hiccup. Nothing has to change, right?\u201d</p>\n<p>Adrien nodded emphatically. \u201cRight.\u201d</p>\n<p>He wasn\u2019t letting go of her hand, and Marinette wasn\u2019t going through any effort to take her hand back either. He was staring at her so earnestly, with green eyes that were familiar for two different yet equally powerful reasons, and she was finding that being lost in them now was a completely foreign but warm, comforting feeling. They were still gorgeous paired with that smile of his that was just a little wider and more natural than she was used to seeing it. All of the things that Marinette dreamed about at night \u2014 the feel of his skin, the hum of his voice, the curve of his lips \u2014 were all things she got to enjoy when she was running across rooftops, fooling around on patrols, sitting on the edge of the Eiffel Tower and stargazing until midnight.</p>\n<p>All those lovely, darling things about him were blurring together, and she realized that she wanted to see Adrien\u2019s eyes stare into her in the doorway of their school on a rainy day, just as much as she wanted them to stare into her on the edge of a building, lungs still straining from a fight.</p>\n<p>She didn\u2019t know what that meant. This didn\u2019t feel like her crush from before, but it still felt charged with something that didn\u2019t feel like just friendship. Adrien was staring down at their linked hands and blinked as if he\u2019d realized how long they\u2019d sat there holding each other. Almost at the same time, they pulled their hands back as if the very touch of their fingers burned. \u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI-I, er\u2026.sorry!\u201d he blurted out. \u201cI, um...I just spaced out. Sorry, that was weird, I\u2026.sorry.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI-It\u2019s fine!\u201d Marinette promised, holding her hands up. \u201cWe\u2019re still in shock I guess.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cRight,\u201d Adrien nodded to himself. \u201cIt\u2019s just shock.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cJust shock\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>Even as she said it, Marinette knew that she was failing wonderfully at convincing herself.</p>\n<p>By the time Saturday morning rolled around, Marinette was completely fed up.</p>\n<p>She yanked all of Adrien\u2019s photos off of her wall, she changed her desktop to a picture of her and Alya, and she even stood on her desk chair and spent close to half an hour dismounting her pulldown calendar and stuffing it under her chaise.</p>\n<p>She took a few of her sketches and some photos she had lying around her desk and sticking out of book covers and used them to cover the blank spaces on her wall. She also put a small post-it on her desktop computer to remind her to put her <em> own </em> schedule on her pull down calendar when she had the extra time to design it.</p>\n<p>It made her room look wholly different, but Marinette found she could breathe better now that Adrien\u2019s photos were hidden.</p>\n<p>Keeping them up almost felt cheap \u2014 like she was bestowing all of her affections on a person that she knew barely anything about, and that was just unfair to Adrien. Marinette saw all of Adrien\u2019s social media pages. Thousands of people were constantly showering him with confessions and declarations of love despite the fact that they only ever knew him from a magazine spread. Marinette didn\u2019t want to be lumped up with people like that. She wanted to like Adrien because he was <em> Adrien </em>.</p>\n<p>Which meant she didn\u2019t earn the right to decorate her room with his face like she knew him best.</p>\n<p>If anything, she had far more pertinent things to accomplish first.</p>\n<p>\u201cMarinette...what on Earth are you doing?\u201d</p>\n<p>Marinette was leaning her chin on her desk and staring suspiciously at her desktop computer. \u201cConditioning my brain.\u201d</p>\n<p>Tikki frowned through her mouthful of cookies while she stared at the computer as well. \u201cMarinette, with all due respect, I think there are far more simpler ways to offset all of this confusion.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, it\u2019ll work, watch,\u201d Marinette assured. \u201cI just have to keep staring at this...until it stops being strange.\u201d</p>\n<p>This being a full screen split photo with Adrien\u2019s photo on the left side and Chat Noir\u2019s photo on the right.</p>\n<p>The idea came to her at close to two in the morning last night, delirious from lack of sleep because how <em> could </em> she sleep? She thought if she stared at the two of them side by side enough, the two pictures would just literally merge themselves together and she\u2019d come to some sort of clarity. What kind of clarity, she didn\u2019t know, since it was pretty late when the idea came to her and she sort of just thought it out halfway and figured that would be good enough.</p>\n<p>Besides, she was willing to try anything at this point to make things <em> not </em> totally uncomfortable between them anymore.</p>\n<p>Tikki sighed. \u201cMarinette I really do think this is something that will solidify once you and Adrien get closer to each other,\u201d Tikki explained. \u201cIt\u2019s like you told me. You\u2019re dealing with a new conception of Adrien. So get to know that new person. This, on the other hand, isn\u2019t going to help you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Marinette held up a finger. \u201cHold on. I\u2019ve almost got it, though. This is going to work. Watch.\u201d</p>\n<p>She covered her right eye with her hand until all she could see was Adrien\u2019s photo. Her crush. Her classmate. Model. Sweet. Polite. Soft. Wonderful.</p>\n<p>She covered her left eye and then focused solely on Chat Noir \u2014 silly, not funny, a show off, brave, loyal, dependable, her dear friend.</p>\n<p>Okay. Fine.</p>\n<p>She dropped both of her hands in her lap and stared at both photos at the same time.</p>\n<p>Marinette let out a long, drawn out whine. \u201cTikki this isn\u2019t working!\u201d</p>\n<p>Tikki settled herself on Marinette\u2019s shoulder and rubbed her hand on her cheek. \u201cAlright, I think we should just turn this off, okay? Come on.\u201d</p>\n<p>Marinette flattened her face on her desk top and switched off her monitor. She started whining again until Tikki nudged her cheek again. \u201cCome on, look at me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Marinette turned her head rested her cheek on the table and frowned at Tikki. \u201cI\u2019m getting confused\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat about?\u201d Tikki asked patiently.</p>\n<p>\u201cMy feelings made sense before,\u201d Marinette explained. \u201cBut now I don\u2019t know what I feel for anyone. It\u2019s all mixing together and I don\u2019t know what to say around him anymore.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMixing together how?\u201d</p>\n<p>Marinette shrugged. \u201cLike when I think of Chat Noir my chest gets all tight. And I think of Adrien and I start to feel guilty. And sometimes I think of him and everything feels nice and sweet, and sometimes it just makes me sick to my stomach.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need to feel guilty,\u201d Tikki soothed. \u201cYou\u2019re a young girl, you\u2019re entitled to your crushes. You\u2019re not betraying anyone because of that. And it\u2019s okay to feel conflicted. I can\u2019t imagine many people would know what it\u2019s like to deal with this sort of surprise.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t fair to him,\u201d Marinette mumbled. \u201cI wasn\u2019t fair to Chat and I wasn\u2019t fair to Adrien. I sold one short and I built one up. I had them both figured completely wrong.\u201d</p>\n<p>This was progress for them, necessary progress, and she didn\u2019t necessarily wish that what had happened yesterday hadn\u2019t happened. But a part of her wanted the simple things back \u2014 doodling Adrien\u2019s name in her notebooks, resting her forehead on Chat\u2019s forehead and letting him embrace her after a long battle, just because she was tired and she needed a hug and nothing else.</p>\n<p>Marinette rubbed the top of Tikki\u2019s head. \u201cYou mentioned that this happens a lot. Ladybug and Chat Noir finding out about each other\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>But Tikki immediately started shaking her head. \u201cIt\u2019s so different every time, Marinette,\u201d Tikki explained. \u201cSometimes they\u2019re complete strangers. Sometimes they can\u2019t stand the sight of each other. Sometimes they\u2019re siblings. Sometimes they start out lovers before they even get their miraculouses. Sometimes they don\u2019t even find out, and die with their secrets. And maybe there have been a few times where things have logistically worked out almost like this. But no one in the universe \u2014 past, present, or future \u2014 can mimic your feelings, or even Adrien\u2019s. There\u2019s no roadmap to this sort of thing.\u201d</p>\n<p>Marinette snorted bitterly. \u201cWell, that\u2019s comforting.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLook,\u201d Tikki began. \u201cDon\u2019t have any expectations. Don\u2019t force things to fit and don\u2019t agonize about small details. There\u2019s really something to be said about learning small bits and pieces of someone until you get a nice charming picture at the end. Something tells me you\u2019re going to like what you end up with.\u201d</p>\n<p>Marinette smiled softly. \u201cI believe you.\u201d She meant what she said to her yesterday. She had a really strong feeling that everything would work out in the end, that they wouldn\u2019t end up any worse than how they\u2019d started. But this felt very much like having a bad day at school \u2014 you knew in the back of your mind that it wasn\u2019t the end of the world, but a part of you still felt like it had every right to mope about it, even if just a little.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d Marinette groaned pathetically. \u201cAll that extra homework and I haven\u2019t started it\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>Tikki laughed. \u201cWorry about it later. Wrap yourself up in a blanket and watch some television. That always makes you feel better.\u201d</p>\n<p>Marinette hadn\u2019t planned on seeing Adrien until Monday morning when they had class again. But there were explosions and sirens bright and early Sunday morning, and Ladybug and Chat Noir found themselves wrapped up with an akuma that took almost two hours to purify. Marinette wondered if it was because the two of them were distracted by everything \u2014 she had to pull out her Lucky Charm twice because she missed the opening needed to use the first one, and Chat Noir was looking a little bit more sluggish and taking just a few more hits than usual. But they finished, and everything was fixed, and they fist bumped just like normal.</p>\n<p>They\u2019d really stretched their five minute limits with their powers though, because both of their miraculouses were screeching shrilly, meaning they had maybe less than a minute before they totally switched back in front of everyone.</p>\n<p>Chat Noir grabbed her hand and sprinted down a narrow street and up the side of a building. \u201cQuick, my house is nearby.\u201d</p>\n<p>Marinette didn\u2019t bother thinking through that implication before she followed Chat Noir \u2014 vaulting over roofs and sticking to the shadows \u2014 before they came up to the back of the Agreste mansion and leaped to the large, wide windows on the upper floors that Marinette knew led into his bedroom. Chat Noir barely had enough time to nudge the locks and push the windows open before they both tumbled onto his carpet and let their transformations expire.</p>\n<p>Adrien had collapsed onto his couch and Marinette had laid herself spread eagle on his floor, the two of them sitting perfectly still and trying to catch their breath.\u00a0Marinette vaguely heard Plagg zipping towards Adrien's bedroom door, complaining about food and cheese and being too exhausted to move, and heard Tikki hissing something at him before they zipped off out of sight, presumably to get their energy back or leave the two of them alone. Knowing Tikki, it was probably both.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy,\u201d Adrien said in annoyance. \u201cOn a <em> Sunday? </em>\u201d</p>\n<p>Marinette shrugged. \u201cHawkmoth doesn\u2019t believe in the Sabbath?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s eight in the morning!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell,\u201d Marinette said. \u201cAt least we\u2019re up.\u201d</p>\n<p>Adrien let out the strangest cross between a groan and a whine and let himself roll of the couch with a thud so that he was lying across the floor only a few meters away from Marinette. \u201cCan we like...not move?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you see me moving?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cJust wanted to make sure we\u2019re on the same page in terms of us sitting here like lumps.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cEh. We\u2019re more like loaves.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy loaves?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI live in a bakery. I always say loaves.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m a model so I always say...oh wait, that doesn\u2019t work.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDo your jokes start sucking when you\u2019re tired too? Because if that\u2019s true, this is a blessing in disguise.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGive me time. The day is still young.\u201d</p>\n<p>Marinette chuckled and gave him a thumbs up. \u201cSlight topic change,\u201d she said. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t happen to have any breakfast would you? I\u2019m starving and I don\u2019t feel like moving.\u201d</p>\n<p>Adrien hummed. \u201cBreakfast isn\u2019t going to go on the table until ten and I doubt you want to wait that long. Plus I doubt my father would be okay with you just waltzing to our breakfast table. We can steal stuff from the kitchen but we\u2019d have to sneak down there and make sure the staff doesn\u2019t see us. Some of them are gossips.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m down for a secret, covert mission down to the kitchens.\u201d</p>\n<p>Adrien snorted. \u201cYeah, you\u2019d know a lot about secret missions wouldn\u2019t you \u2014 \u201d</p>\n<p>He suddenly stopped in the middle of his sentence, sat up straight, and smacked his hands on his cheeks. \u201cWait a minute\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p>\n<p>Adrien spun around too quickly and almost whipped his head against the couch\u00a0when he faced her. \u201c<em> Wait </em> a minute!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat!\u201d Marinette said again.</p>\n<p>He started pointing at her and had a face on that made it seem like he suddenly noticed Marinette had four heads. \u201cWait. A. <em> Minute!!\u201d </em></p>\n<p>Marinette glared at him and decided that she probably wasn\u2019t going to be getting to lay down and snooze like she wanted to. \u201cOh my God, <em> what? </em>\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou weren\u2019t on a secret mission!\u201d</p>\n<p>Marinette furrowed her brows and leaned forward. \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d</p>\n<p>Adrien was waving his hands around frantically. \u201cThat time we fought The Evillustrator! When you totally left me alone with Chloe \u2014 totally mean, by the way, still not over that \u2014 and you sent me off to go watch after Marinette while you were on a secret mission. You weren\u2019t on a secret mission!\u201d</p>\n<p>Marinette blinked. \u201cUh huh.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou were sending me to go watch after yourself!\u201d</p>\n<p>Marinette puffed out her cheeks, looked to the side, and nodded. \u201cUh...yeah.\u201d</p>\n<p>Adrien hesitated for a moment as if he were expecting Marinette to have an equally outlandish reaction, but instead he was met with nothing and it only served to further confuse him. \u201cWhy aren\u2019t you freaking out about this!?\u201d</p>\n<p>Marinette smirked at him. \u201cUm, because I already <em> knew </em> that? I was the one who lied about the secret mission because I was leading you to me? This isn\u2019t news for me.\u201d</p>\n<p>He stared at her helplessly, and she almost wanted to laugh at the sight of his blush starting to blossom on his cheekbones as a realization started to slowly melt onto his face. He let out a loud frustrated scream and fell back against the couch cushions with his feet in the air. \u201cOh my God, I totally flexed in front of you like a total loser!!!\u201d</p>\n<p>Marinette couldn\u2019t help herself \u2014 he looked so silly sitting there in his self pity and he looked so bothered by the realization that Marinette just had to let out a long, loud laugh. \u201cYou seemed to think you pretty cool while you were doing it!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s because I thought you were just Marinette!\u201d Adrien exclaimed. \u201cLadybug probably saw right through that. <em> You </em> saw right through that! And you just let me go on?\u201d</p>\n<p>Marinette covered her tittering with her hand. \u201cI mean, you looked like you had the whole thing pretty rehearsed so I wasn\u2019t about to interrupt you. Besides, I said plenty to you behind your back.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, gee, <em> thanks! </em>\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, what\u2019s the big deal?\u201d Marinette grinned. \u201cIt happened such a long time ago, I totally forgot about it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Adrien stared at her as if she were missing the obvious. \u201cI called you my Ladybug.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTechnically I am.\u201d</p>\n<p>But Adrien sighed dramatically and bent over the back of the couch with his butt in the air, muttering something that Marinette couldn\u2019t understand. How undignified, but she couldn\u2019t help but feel just a little bit bad for him. She could tell that Chat Noir was trying to impress her for some reason because that\u2019s just how Chat Noir sought his validation from people. That\u2019s why she kept up the act of being impressed with him so that she wouldn\u2019t dampen his mood too much, because even she wasn\u2019t capable of that. But Chat Noir always seemed to tone it back just a touch where Ladybug was concerned because she supposed it was her opinion that he cared most about. She was sure he was heavily embarrassed, but she couldn\u2019t help but find the sight so endearing. Who knew Adrien could look so positively mortified? She almost wanted to take a picture of this, save it, and put it on her wall instead.</p>\n<p>Marinette decided to take pity on him and sat next to him on the couch, patting his back comfortingly. \u201cThere, there, kitty,\u201d she soothed. \u201cI didn\u2019t find you <em> completely </em> humiliating.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo mean!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI guess we\u2019re not getting breakfast then, are we?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShush, you\u2019re interrupting my shame.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m sorry, would you like me to leave you alone?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s customary, yes.\u201d</p>\n<p>Marinette leaned her elbow on the back of the couch and looked over the edge to see Adrien\u2019s hair flipped upside down and hanging over his forehead. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. Your precious fan base won\u2019t be hearing anything from me about this.\u201d</p>\n<p>She was prepared for more groaning and whining, but instead Adrien whipped back up until he was kneeling on the couch and staring at Marinette with a grin that was practically splitting his face in half. He giggled \u2014 actually <em> giggled </em> \u2014 a little before he reached over and poked Marinette in the cheek. \u201cSpeaking of fan base\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Marinette smirked. \u201cMad that mine\u2019s bigger?\u201d</p>\n<p>But Adrien merely shook his head. \u201cYou know, this entire time I was always wondering why Ladybug had such issues with Chloe\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>Marinette\u2019s entire face fell the moment the girl\u2019s name left Adrien\u2019s lips, and she pointed at him straight in the nose and frowned. \u201cNo!\u201d</p>\n<p>But Adrien was already laughing through his words and bouncing a little on the couch. \u201cIt made no sense because Ladybug doesn\u2019t get bothered by anyone without a reason, and you just despised her on sight. But that\u2019s because it was you!\u201d</p>\n<p>Marinette quickly turned away from him, scowling frightfully. \u201cShut up!\u201d</p>\n<p>But Adrien was already cackling at her expense. \u201cOh god, and she <em> adores you! </em> Chloe\u2019s always talking my head off about how much Marinette annoys her and how Ladybug is ten times better...and you\u2019re the same person!\u201d He was holding his stomach and accidentally knocked his head against the arm of the couch.</p>\n<p>Marinette rolled her eyes. \u201cI don\u2019t want to talk about her,\u201d she pouted.</p>\n<p>\u201cImagine!\u201d Adrien announced. \u201cJust imagine! If Chloe knew that she secretly cosplays as Marinette every night. I think she\u2019d have a conniption!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t care less,\u201d Marinette said in annoyance. \u201cI don\u2019t like her fawning all over me, she grates my nerves everytime she gets near me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShe likes you!\u201d Adrien kept insisting, poking Marinette in the side.</p>\n<p>She flinched away and slapped his hand. \u201cShe hates me!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut she also likes you!\u201d Adrien continued. He swiped his hair away from his face, already so messy from all of his dramatics and curled his legs underneath him. \u201cYou have to admit. This is crazy and kind of unexpected, but I was waiting for this to get funny. It\u2019s kind of nice that we can laugh about it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou mean that you can laugh about it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m sorry, was I imagining my mortification?\u201d</p>\n<p>Marinette nudged him playfully with her shoulder. \u201cThat\u2019s different. You deserved it. Your flattery is downright terrible.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Adrien said, sounding unconvinced. \u201cMy flattery is pretty good.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIf by good, you mean corny, then yes it\u2019s excellent.\u201d</p>\n<p>Adrien cleared his throat and regarded her seriously. \u201cMy flattery has the perfect balance of cleverness and whimsy for it to be considered perfectly endearing instead of ridiculously skeevy. I spent a long time working out the exact equations necessary to pull this off and I\u2019m rather offended that you\u2019re just chalking all that hard work up to corniness.\u201d</p>\n<p>Marinette squinted her eyes and stared at him in disbelief. \u201cDo you hear yourself sometimes?\u201d</p>\n<p>Adrien cupped his chin and waggled his eyebrows. \u201cYes, and it is music to my ears.\u201d</p>\n<p>Marinette wasn\u2019t impressed. \u201cAbysmal.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPerfected equations, Marinette. You have no appreciation for maths.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t need to have an appreciation for maths to know how to flatter and flirt with people.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUm, I dunno. My thing is kind of foolproof.\u201d</p>\n<p>Marinette leaned a little closer to him. \u201cI think I can do a little bit better than that.\u201d</p>\n<p>Adrien lifted one brow, crossed his arms, and leaned back against the couch, staring at Marinette like he was squaring her up. \u201cAlright, let\u2019s see you do better.\u201d</p>\n<p>It was classic Ladybug and Chat Noir banter, and Marinette almost forgot that this was also Adrien that she was technically fooling around with too. But a lot of their teasing consisted mostly of challenging one another and going through the laborious task of trying to figure out who was really better than the other, and it always resulted in silly challenges and clever little quips, and Marinette honestly loved every single second of it. If only because it let her humble Chat Noir a little and let her spread her sarcasm a little thicker than she otherwise would have in front of her classmates and her family.</p>\n<p>Marinette smiled. \u201cI supposed I\u2019m going to have to try and follow your status quo just a little, right?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPersonally, I\u2019m of the opinion that knuckle kissing will never get old.\u201d</p>\n<p>Marinette tapped her finger on her lips. \u201cI beg to differ. But I guess I\u2019ll hold your hand if it makes you feel better,\u201d she teased, picking up his hand and gripping it much like she would\u2019ve if they were merely about to have a handshake.</p>\n<p>Adrien looked down skeptically. \u201cIs this supposed to be charming me?\u201d</p>\n<p>Marinette chuckled, squeezing his hand gently before loosening her grip and brushing her palm along the length of his, purposefully taking her time to make sure the lines on their hands and their fingertips lined up perfectly. She noticed briefly that his palms were peppered with little calluses \u2014 probably from fencing or for holding pens too tightly \u2014 that looked like they\u2019d been repeatedly buffed down by stylists only to stubbornly pop up again. But Marinette quite liked them and rubbed the pads of her fingers against them, not ever having the chance to notice such a small detail before. His hands were much bigger than hers, his skin was just a little bit more tanned, and she could just see the little tan line poking out from underneath the miraculous ring he always wore and never took off. As strange as it sounded, she much rather liked his hands.</p>\n<p>Suddenly remembering what she was meant to be doing, she bit her lip nervously, and peeked up from behind her lashes. \u201cNo,\u201d she said, a slight jump of nerves peeking into her voice. \u201cI just wanted to see how well our hands fit together.\u201d</p>\n<p>It wasn\u2019t as smooth as she\u2019d meant for it to come out. It was supposed to be just a silly joke, kept tight and together by her typical Ladybug brand of confidence, but it came out a little softer and little more vulnerable than she\u2019d meant for it, and therefore sounded a lot more sincere than the joke it was supposed to be. It showed on Adrien\u2019s face as well, because he didn\u2019t look impressed or amused \u2014 he looked positively shocked, and that was definitely a proud and true blush form on his face again. Not like the one that popped up when he was embarrassed. This one left his mouth slightly ajar, left him licking his lips, left his eyes looking too big and too green and too starstruck for it to be a simple reaction to a good pick up line. She couldn\u2019t tell what was going through his head, but it seemed like she\u2019d stunned him for a few seconds, left him completely frozen and left his words trapped just behind his throat.</p>\n<p>Marinette knew she should\u2019ve said something to break the spell and bring them back to their previous mood. But Adrien was already sliding his hand out from underneath hers just a touch before his thumb came to slide across her knuckles and grab her fingers in a grip that seemed so familiar but much more intimate. His thumb trembled a little as he brushed it back and forth, and he was looking at her like he was so scared of what she might do and what she might say in return, but still he lifted her hand to his lips and left a light, careful kiss right on her middle two knuckles.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re absolutely right,\u201d he chuckled softly. \u201cThey fit together perfectly.\u201d</p>\n<p>God, and her entire face felt like it was on fire, because this was so darn <em> new </em> for her. It was Adrien\u2019s face and Adrien\u2019s hesitance mixed together with a line and a gesture that was so undeniably Chat Noir, and they molded together seamlessly. She recognized little parts of each of them, but she couldn\u2019t tell where one started and where the other one ended. After all of the silly agonizing she was doing in front of her computer monitor yesterday, she finally saw a glimpse of what she was trying to solidify in her mind \u2014 the perfection of this new boy sitting in front of her, vulnerable but oh so hopeful. She didn\u2019t think that such an over the top action could possibly make her chest so light, but here it was and here was he. The boy she needed to know better. The boy she wished would look her in the eyes and kiss her knuckles again.</p>\n<p>They realized just how charged the atmosphere between them was because they slowly took their hands back and stared into their laps. Marinette cleared her throat first and tried to cut through the heaviness. \u201cYeah, so...that\u2019s how, um...that\u2019s how you\u2019re supposed to do it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cRight, yeah,\u201d Adrien nodded. \u201cDuly noted.\u201d</p>\n<p>Just like that, the magic was fading \u2014 suddenly things were uncomfortable and made Marinette want to wriggle around in her seat to get rid of all the weird buzzing feelings in her chest. But it wasn\u2019t her imagination. She\u2019d seen it. They\u2019d grabbed that clarity they desperately wanted for just a short few seconds.</p>\n<p>The silence between them was very awkward and very loud for a solid twenty seconds, and Marinette desperately tried to root around in her mind for something neutral that she could use to try and neutralize it. The first thing that her eyes laid on was the large familiar folder of homework sitting on Adrien\u2019s desk and she quickly pointed to. \u201cSo...done the extra credit yet?\u201d</p>\n<p>Adrien blinked and stared back at his desk. He winced and slouched his shoulders a little. \u201cI totally forgot about that. It\u2019s due tomorrow?\u201d</p>\n<p>Marinette nodded. \u201cThink so.\u201d She tapped her hands on her knees to a little tune and shrugged. \u201cWant to, uh\u2026.want to work on it together? It\u2019ll be quicker with two people.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have any of your books.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll just take pictures of my answers and copy them over tonight. It\u2019s fine.\u201d</p>\n<p>Adrien looked like he was eager for the distraction to, because he jumped to his feet and shook out his arms. \u201cYeah, sure okay. Yeah, homework. Between the two of us, it shouldn\u2019t be so bad.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s the idea,\u201d she smiled.</p>\n<p>\u201cCool. Cool, cool,\u201d he nodded to himself, shaking his head as if to rid himself of the last few sticky feelings of the charged moment they\u2019d just shared. \u201cI\u2019ll just tell the chefs I\u2019m skipping breakfast to study, and I\u2019ll bring up some snacks. Sound good?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Marinette perked up. \u201cI\u2019ll just...I\u2019ll be here.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGood.\u201d Adrien started walked backwards to the door to his bedroom. \u201cI\u2019ll just...I\u2019ll go and, uh, get them then. Are you good?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, good.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGood.\u201d</p>\n<p>Adrien quickly slipped out of his room after that, and Marinette felt herself let out a huge breath once the coast was clear. The room was absolutely quiet, not even the noises from the street could be heard, and her heart was beating so loud she could hear it clearly pumping in her ears.</p>\n<p>Nino slammed his head on the table and spoke through the wood. \u201cOkay. I propose we elect the most cultured person at this table to complete the chemistry homework for the group.\u201d He pointed a weak finger at Adrien. \u201cAnd that would be you, bro.\u201d</p>\n<p>Adrien made a face. \u201cHow is that <em> at all </em> fair?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSimple,\u201d Nino smiled. \u201cSince the day you were born, you\u2019ve been marinating in wealth, money, and power and all that affluence has mutated your brain to make you naturally good at ridiculously high-brow stuff like knowing which fork is the cheese fork and knowing how to fold napkins and how to solve chemistry problems with no real world application. So...yeah! You do all this mess.\u201d</p>\n<p>Adrien furrowed his brows. \u201cOr I pay attention in class\u2026?\u201d</p>\n<p>Nino whined and pushed his book towards Adrien. \u201cPlease give me the answers.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI charge forty euros for my <em> cultured </em> advice. So it\u2019d have to be forty per answer.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou suck!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIf you need <em> help </em>, I\u2019ll gladly give it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Alya reached over the table, sitting across from Nino, and used her pencil to turn his textbook two pages back. \u201cThey tell you how to do the problems right here. Just follow the directions!\u201d</p>\n<p>Nino frowned. \u201cTextbooks tell you how to add two and two to get four. Then your teacher turns around and asks you to calculate our distance from the sun.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThese problems are not that hard,\u201d she deadpanned.</p>\n<p>\u201cSays you! You\u2019ve only done two of them!\u201d</p>\n<p>Adrien made eye contact with Marinette sitting directly across from him and comically rolled his eyes, making Marinette laugh into her notebook and nudge her foot against Adrien\u2019s under the table. They\u2019d been given a truly monstrous Chemistry problem set due in class tomorrow, and Nino had taken one look at it and decided that they were all going to camp out in one of the study rooms and figure out all the problems together, because no human being could possibly be expected to complete all these problems by themselves. They\u2019d been at it for the past hour and the only person that seemed to have having any luck with them was Adrien, who horrified the whole table by calling these types of problems \u201cfun\u201d and compared them to \u201clittle puzzles.\u201d Needless to say, he wasn\u2019t going to be going home until everyone else had made some serious headway.</p>\n<p>Marinette didn\u2019t mind at all. She was probably going to transform into Ladybug and swing over to Adrien\u2019s house later that night anyway so that he could help her, so the four of them studying together now just meant that Marinette could get her homework done quicker and maybe actually get some designing in tonight if she decided to be particularly productive.</p>\n<p>Marinette laughed, still looking down at her calculator and circling what she hoped was the right answer. \u201cApparently these are the easy ones. The harder ones we\u2019re gonna get tomorrow for over the weekend.\u201d</p>\n<p>Nino pulled his cap down so that it covered his face. \u201cDon\u2019t remind me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Alya groaned loudly, scooted her chair around the corner of the table so that she was sitting next to Nino, and dragged her books over. \u201cAlright, I\u2019m tired of hearing you complain. I\u2019m at least four problems ahead of you, so come on.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI want the rich kid to teach me!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat rich kid is too nice and is going to coddle the answers out of you. I lack that patience which means you\u2019ll finish your homework quicker.\u201d Alya grinned at Adrien. \u201cNo offense.\u201d</p>\n<p>Adrien lifted his hands. \u201cHey, no offense taken. I entrust him to you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Nino rolled his eyes dramatically, but pillowed his head in his arms and watched Alya start to set up the first problem for him. Adrien patted him encouragingly on the top of his head and turned back to Marinette. \u201cSo how are you doing?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay, I think?\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m through with more than half of them, I\u2019m just stuck on number fourteen.\u201d</p>\n<p>Adrien peeked over at her notebook. \u201cIs that the barium dichloride problem? Yeah I messed that one up a couple of times before I figured it out.\u201d</p>\n<p>Marinette pouted. \u201cCan you help me? I keep getting the wrong answer.\u201d</p>\n<p>Adrien waggled his brows. \u201cSo now <em> you\u2019re </em> asking the rich prince for help? How flattering.\u201d</p>\n<p>Marinette\u2019s face fell. \u201cGet over here and help me, you silly boy.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAs the lady wishes,\u201d he winked, before he dragged his chair over to settle right next to hers.</p>\n<p>It took a little over a week, but Marinette was at least at the point where watching Adrien transform into Chat Noir and vice versa didn\u2019t make her blink in disbelief or make her think she was daydreaming anymore. It was hard to let that sort of thing take you by surprise when they realized that they spent so much time together between school, patrol, and akuma attacks. Once all that novelty was smoothed away, it made hanging out with Adrien exceedingly simple since he\u2019d suddenly seemed so non-threatening to her now and very easy to deal with. How could she possibly stand to be intimidated by a boy who came to her skylight at two in the morning, scratching at her window panes with his claws, and begging for the palmiers she promised she\u2019d bring to school for him but didn\u2019t? Or by a boy who\u2019d pop up from his couch when she came to visit him at night, prepared with movies and cartoons and animes that Marinette simply <em> had </em> to see, no questions asked?</p>\n<p>It had the novelty of Adrien with the familiarity of Chat, and Marinette was only thankful that process was turning out to be more fun than it was daunting.</p>\n<p>So when Adrien rested his chin on her shoulder and nuzzled up into her neck much like a cat would as she showed him the problem, Marinette didn\u2019t think anything of it because that\u2019s just how they worked. Ladybug was so used to Chat Noir\u2019s affection that it was second nature at that point, and the best part was that they never had to explain it to anyone because it was something just between the two of them. It carried over wonderfully to Adrien and Marinette, and it was more comforting than anything else to find things about them that didn\u2019t have to change now that they knew their identities.</p>\n<p>But just because things were normal for Chat Noir and Ladybug didn\u2019t mean they were necessarily normal for Adrien and Marinette, at least in the eyes of people like Alya who was looking at the two of them sitting so close to each other with one of those suspicious, calculating glances, like she was desperately trying to uncrack a mystery that was unfolding right in front of her. Adrien\u2019s arm was over her shoulder, she was wrapping her hand around his wrist while he started to talk her through the parts of the problem she had messed up, and Marinette glanced up at Alya to try and shrug off the scrutiny.</p>\n<p>Not that it seemed to be working because Alya just pushed her glasses up her nose, nodded at Marinette, and pegged her with a look that meant they were going to be talking about this soon. Marinette tried not to roll her eyes at her, but Marinette always found Alya\u2019s poking and prodding to be really overwhelming to deal with when it was directed right at Marinette herself. She was going to be in for an earful later.</p>\n<p>Adrien was writing little notes in her notebook so that she wouldn\u2019t forget his instructions. \u201cYou balanced the equation just fine, but the reaction actually leaves you when a few hydrogen ions in addition to the precipitate. So it should make more sense like this.\u201d</p>\n<p>Marinette unconsciously leaned her head against Adrien\u2019s and nodded. \u201cGot it. Oh, that\u2019s why it took forever to balance before!\u201d</p>\n<p>Adrien laughed. \u201cYup, should be way easier now.\u201d He was doodling a little cat with a thumbs up in the corner of her notebook and snorted in laughter when she snatched her pencil back.</p>\n<p>\u201cGo doodle over there,\u201d she smirked.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt was my stamp of approval,\u201d Adrien insisted as she pulled his chair back over to his own spot. \u201cChemistry Help a la Adrien! You could say thank you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Marinette rolled her eyes. \u201cThanks <em> I guess. </em>\u201d</p>\n<p>He put a hand to his chest and did a small bow. \u201cWhy, you\u2019re very welcome.\u201d</p>\n<p>She was giggling behind her hand, but happened to catch Alya\u2019s eye again who was smirking unabashedly and darting her eyes between Marinette and Adrien. Nino was to her side, groaning and leaning his head on her arm as he circled another answer to one of the problems. \u201cCan we take a break?\u201d</p>\n<p>Adrien snorted. \u201cWe just started.\u201d</p>\n<p>But Alya stood up from her chair and walked around to Marinette\u2019s side. \u201cActually, I don\u2019t mind a break. I need to go to the bathroom anyway. Marinette, come with me.\u201d</p>\n<p>That didn\u2019t sound like she was leaving Marinette with much of a choice, which means they weren\u2019t just going to the bathroom. She slid down in her chair and pulled her books closer to her for protection. \u201cUm\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPerfect! Thanks, girlie. Let\u2019s go!\u201d Marinette didn't have time to protest before Alya closed all of Marinette\u2019s books, pulled her chair out, and gently nudged the girl out of her chair and out of the study room.</p>\n<p>There weren\u2019t too many people staying after school that day, so when Alya pushed them into the bathroom right outside in the hallway, it was completely empty. Already submitting herself to an interrogation, Marinette leaned against one of the sinks and watched Alya lock the door to the bathroom and lean on the door with her arms crossed over her chest. She shrugged her shoulders and smiled. \u201cSo. Anything you want to tell me?\u201d</p>\n<p>Marinette tapped her nails against the porcelain. \u201cAs a matter of fact, I do,\u201d she said evasively. \u201cYour eyeliner has been smudged for the past two class periods. You should touch it back up before we go back.\u201d</p>\n<p>Alya snorted, then paused and looked at herself in the mirror. \u201cGee thanks for telling me,\u201d she said, swiping her finger underneath her eye. \u201cBut come on. You know what I\u2019m talking about.\u201d</p>\n<p>Marinette smirked. \u201cYou\u2019re going to have to be more specific.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh don\u2019t you start clamming up on me now!\u201d Alya demanded. \u201cI\u2019m actually kind of shocked you\u2019re not having a conniption about this.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAbout what?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHon, you know damn well what about.\u201d</p>\n<p>Deciding that there was no sense in beating around the bush \u2014 the best way to deal with Alya was to just take the plunge sooner rather than later \u2014 Marinette sighed and dragged a hand down her face. \u201cYou\u2019re reading way too much into this, that\u2019s why I didn\u2019t say anything.\u201d</p>\n<p>Alya tapped her finger against her chin. \u201cUm, I\u2019m sorry. Two weeks ago, you would take one look at Adrien and completely forget what consonants are. Forgive me if I\u2019m questioning how you two started all of a sudden texting in the middle of class like losers and having debates about haute couture, of all things, in between every single class.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re both in and/or interested in the fashion industry!\u201d Marinette said innocently. \u201cThat\u2019s hardly weird.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd the texting?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe were partners on our last history project. We were communicating about our presentation.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Alya smiled knowingly. \u201cA presentation that was done a week ago. Your excuse now?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNothing!\u201d Marinette exclaimed.</p>\n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s something going on between you two!\u201d Alya said triumphantly, poking Marinette in the nose and chuckling when she flinched away and slapped Alya\u2019s shoulder. \u201cI\u2019ve been patient enough about this. So spill. Right now. I\u2019m not leaving you alone until you do.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWould you relax?\u201d Marinette groaned, pushing Alya\u2019s finger away and pressing it down against her chest. \u201cIt seriously isn\u2019t that big of a deal.\u201d</p>\n<p>Alya scoffed. \u201cDevelopments about <em> Adrien </em> aren\u2019t that big of a deal?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Marinette said tiredly. \u201cThey aren\u2019t.\u201d</p>\n<p>Had Alya breached the subject of Adrien two weeks ago \u2014 if the major development had been something like holding a one minute conversation or getting him to touch her shoulder again \u2014 she would\u2019ve gladly joined in the gushing, and she knew that was the reaction that Alya was trying to garner from her, if only to tease her as well as get information. But that sort of excitability lost its appeal and seemed superficial \u2014 this didn\u2019t seem like the kind of situation where pressing his magazine covers to her chest and rolling around in her bed out of equal parts excitement and mortification seemed like the method to take up. Of course, Alya didn\u2019t know that, nor did she know that it was because Adrien had stopped being such a lofty and unattainable goal and had become someone that Marinette desperately needed to understand.</p>\n<p>But what was she supposed to say? No, she wasn\u2019t necessarily crushing on Adrien anymore, at least not in the way she was before. No, she didn\u2019t want to freak out and jump around her room about him because it felt insincere. No, she rather didn\u2019t want to gossip about all that she\u2019d told him and all that he\u2019d done because it seemed personal somehow \u2014 something that only they needed to understand.</p>\n<p>She was in a curious situation where she\u2019d made progress with the boy that couldn\u2019t really be measured as having moved forward or back. It had shifted onto a completely different plane of evaluation, and she was suddenly struck by the fact that now she didn\u2019t know how to talk about him to other people anymore, especially Alya who had been privy to all of her domestic fantasies about him for the past year.</p>\n<p>Here was Alya waiting for an answer, and Marinette had nothing to give.</p>\n<p>She must have been quiet for a long time because Alya was looking up at her worriedly, taking her hand in hers and squeezing her fingers. \u201cHey,\u201d she said softly. \u201cLook, I was just teasing. You don\u2019t have to tell me anything if you don\u2019t want to. It\u2019s just...I mean, I thought that this would be exciting for you. What\u2019s the matter?\u201d</p>\n<p>Marinette shook her head. \u201cNo, no, it is. This is a good thing,\u201d she promised. \u201cI\u2019m not trying to say that it isn\u2019t.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI mean, you two didn\u2019t seem to want to offer any explanations, so Nino and I haven\u2019t been pressing it because we thought you two were shy or something, but\u2026\u201d Alya paused for a moment, rolling her words around for once before she spoke them. \u201cDo you mind if I asked what changed? You don\u2019t have to tell me everything, but I always thought you\u2019d be jumping out of your skin about it and ranting about marriage and kids and dates and all that good stuff.\u201d</p>\n<p>Marinette bit her lip. \u201cI\u2019m not...I\u2019m not upset or anything,\u201d she promised. \u201cIt\u2019s just...I guess I\u2019m trying to treat him a little more fairly now.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFairly?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLike I don\u2019t want to just make out all these silly future plans about him without knowing more about him,\u201d she explained carefully. \u201cI guess I sort of thought that being friends first would be a better way to take this.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI fully agree,\u201d Alya assented. \u201cTo be fair, you did always kind of build that kid up in your head a lot. I mean, he <em> is </em> just a boy \u2014 not some God that you have to keep little idols and likenesses of all over your room, and declare some kind of transcendent love for.\u201d</p>\n<p>Marinette rolled her eyes. \u201c<em> Okay </em>. I did not treat him like a God.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou get my point,\u201d she continued. \u201cSo...you\u2019re trying to be friends, and then you\u2019re going to go in for the kill?\u201d</p>\n<p>Marinette shirted her feet and looked away from Alya. \u201c...well. That\u2019s the thing\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>Alya blinked at her, noticed Marinette\u2019s silence, and gently massaged her fingers into Marinette\u2019s shoulder. \u201cWait a minute,\u201d she asked. \u201cAre you not\u2026?\u201d</p>\n<p>Marinette huffed. \u201cI don\u2019t know!\u201d she said honestly. \u201cI had all these plans about confessing my feelings and maybe trying to task him on a date some time, and it seemed like a serious possibility before. But now...I don\u2019t know, Alya, I\u2019m really starting to become friends with him, I think. And it\u2019s nice! I mean, we\u2019re not all the way there yet, but it\u2019s working for us. And now all I can think about it messing that up somehow with all of my other feelings.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo\u2026\u201d Alya said slowly. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to tell him anything?\u201d</p>\n<p>She merely shrugged in response. It was just a touch more complicated than how she\u2019d explained it. Being friends with Adrien now that they knew about each other was absolutely lovely, just because she didn\u2019t think that the two of them could ever become such closer friends. It was that kind of new friendship that you wanted to enjoy because it worked well, especially now that their familiarity had helped smooth out any lingering uncertainty or awkwardness that had erupted between the two of them.</p>\n<p>But that was due partly because Marinette was doing her best to keep them from cropping up at all. Ever since that moment in Adrien\u2019s room where something so heavily charged passed through her just from Adrien kissing her hand made her afraid of what she felt for him now \u2014 was it a crush? Was it something completely different? It certainly <em> felt </em>different, but Marinette was hardly an expert on these things to be able to tell why this was. Plus, it was so impossible to be able to tell what was going on in Adrien\u2019s head amidst this mess, and she was almost afraid to ask.</p>\n<p>If her feelings were shifting, surely his were too. A secret, insecure part of her didn\u2019t want to know how, especially if it meant spoiling what had already been laid down.</p>\n<p>So Marinette shook her head. \u201cWhy ruin a good thing?\u201d she muttered. \u201cDon\u2019t try and fix what isn\u2019t broken, you know?\u201d</p>\n<p>Alya sighed out and looked at her pitifully. \u201cMarinette, your feelings aren\u2019t so destructive that they\u2019re going to ruin anything. You can\u2019t just hold things because you\u2019re afraid of what they\u2019ll do. It\u2019s terrifying, yeah, but can\u2019t just...not tell him this. That\u2019s not fair to you!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not about being fair to me,\u201d Marinette explained. \u201cIf anything, I\u2019m being fair to him. Trust me, this would just make things so weird and strange, and I don\u2019t want to do that. We\u2019re friends,\u201d she said decisively. \u201cThat\u2019s lovely. That\u2019s all I could ask for.\u201d</p>\n<p>Alya twisted her mouth. \u201cAre you sure about that?\u201d</p>\n<p>No. \u201cYeah, I\u2019m sure.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay, you gotta move in just a little closer.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMy cheek is pressing against your cheek, we can\u2019t possibly get any closer.\u201d</p>\n<p>Chat waggled his eyebrows. \u201cAh, ye of little imagination.\u201d</p>\n<p>Ladybug shoved a thumb into his side and smirked when he yelped and pouted at her. \u201cDown boy, otherwise I\u2019m cancelling this little photoshoot of yours.\u201d</p>\n<p>Chat Noir lowered the camera on his baton that he was pointing down to the two them and turned Ladybug to face him, deciding to repeat his point. \u201cLook, Adrien has an Instagram. Marinette has an Instagram. Ladybug and Chat Noir should have an Instagram. Can you imagine how many followers we\u2019d get? And Alya would flip. This is for a good cause.\u201d</p>\n<p>Ladybug snorted. \u201cYou\u2019re just going to use this to post pictures of you flexing and videos of you telling all of your cat puns.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m failing to understand the problem here.\u201d</p>\n<p>Ladybug rolled her eyes. \u201cSince when was social media required of superheroes?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUm, because Instagram filters are cool, and we already established that we can\u2019t download Snapchat on my baton or on your yo-yo.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure it\u2019s because the App Store isn\u2019t hooked up to ancient magical devices.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd I will be having a chat with Plagg about that,\u201d Chat Noir nodded. \u201cBut for now, we\u2019ll take the pictures, and I can post them to our super-secret-awesome superhero account at home! Besides, don\u2019t you think the whole world should be able to share in the glory that is witnessing how completely awesome and badass you are.\u201d</p>\n<p>Ladybug tapped her finger against her lips. \u201cHm. I am pretty badass\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSee?\u201d Chat grinned wickedly. \u201cCome on! We\u2019ll take a silly one. Make your dumbest face.\u201d</p>\n<p>Ladybug rolled her eyes, wrapped an arm around Chat Noir\u2019s neck, and pulled him closer so that their faces were touching again and were smushed into the frame. \u201cI\u2019ll do my best, although I\u2019m assuming your face won\u2019t change much\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>Chat Noir gasped dramatically. \u201cRude!\u201d</p>\n<p>Ladybug giggled. \u201cI\u2019m kidding, kitty cat. Relax. Just tell me when you\u2019re taking it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Chat lifted his hand and pointed the camera at the two of them. \u201cAlright, on three.\u201d</p>\n<p>Chat Noir always had these strange little ideas for the two of them to get distracted with whenever patrols got boring or whenever they were too riled up for some reason to go back to their homes. Sometimes, Chat Noir would bring a handball and they\u2019d play sets across the rooftops and start drawing crowds and referees without even asking for them. Ladybug decided to follow it up with a parkour competition across the city \u2014 no yo-yos, no batons, just them. They also got into a pretty dramatic handstand competition on the edge of a building once that got a considerable amount of attention because of how precarious their position was. Ladybug didn\u2019t think that Chat Noir did it for fame or attention or anything like that, not really. Tonight, he\u2019d grabbed her, pulled out his camera, and asked her if she wanted to make an Instagram profile.</p>\n<p>\u201cOw!\u201d Ladybug screamed, smacking him in the arm. \u201cYou can\u2019t tickle me to get a good photo, that\u2019s cheating!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMy Lady, I already know how pretty you are,\u201d he said simply. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to keep your silly face looking so tame. Really sell the ugly face for me. This is our first photo!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUgh, you\u2019re so picky,\u201d she complained. \u201cWhat do you want me to do, shove my fingers up my nose?\u201d</p>\n<p>Chat grinned. \u201c<em> Could </em> you do that?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTake the photo, you awful cat!\u201d</p>\n<p>Chat leaned in closer to her and grinned with all his teeth. \u201cYou know what? I kinda want a tickling picture after all.\u201d</p>\n<p>Ladybug\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cNo, nonono don\u2019t you da \u2014 hahahahahaha!\u201d</p>\n<p>The camera clicks were going off and Chat Noir was tickling her ribs and making her roll around on the roof. \u201cNo, come on come on, you have to look at the camera!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGet o \u2014 hahaha \u2014 get <em> off </em>, hahaha!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cStop kicking me!\u201d Chat laughed hysterically. \u201cI\u2019m trying to be photogenic!\u201d</p>\n<p>They rolled around on the ground for a few more seconds, Ladybug slowly losing her breath and Chat Noir championing through all of the blows she was throwing at him in between all her giggling before Chat Noir scampered away, holding his baton up in the air and laughing as he scrolled through all of the photos. \u201cOh man. These are fantastic. I think there are tears coming out of your eyes in this last one.\u201d</p>\n<p>Ladybug was on her back, panting and pointing at him menacingly. \u201cYou...are...<em> so mean </em>!\u201d</p>\n<p>But Chat Noir was laughing to himself and started sending the pictures to his civilian cell phone. \u201cGoing. On. Insta.\u201d</p>\n<p>He was distracted with his pictures and didn\u2019t see Ladybug slowly get up on her hands and knees, slink over to the other side of the roof, and jump up to pounce on his back in a way that would make his feline tendencies absolutely proud. Her legs immediately squeezed around his hips while she reached over his shoulders to try and get his baton. \u201cGive me those pictures, I\u2019m deleting them!\u201d</p>\n<p>Ladybug was tipping him off balance but he tried his best to hold his much longer arm out in front of him to keep her from snatching the baton away. \u201cNooo, stop it\u2019ll be funny!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t make me tickle you back!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em> Stop!! </em> I\u2019m super ticklish, come on just let me post them!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIn your dreams!\u201d</p>\n<p>In the end, Ladybug couldn\u2019t stop him in time before he sent the pictures to his phone and swore up and down to every deity that he could think of that they were going on the Internet that night. But she had managed to corner Chat Noir against a chimney and found out that he was delightfully more ticklish that she was, and was howling into the air with laughter when she dug her fingers into his sides and gleefully watched him dissolve into a mess on the ground, crying uncle and begging her to stop.</p>\n<p>He had his arms crossed in an X as tears leaked from the corners of his eyes. \u201cO-Okay, haha, you win, you win, I\u2019m done.\u201d</p>\n<p>Ladybug smirked with her hands on her hips. \u201cNow we\u2019re even.\u201d</p>\n<p>Chat Noir sighed out breathlessly and shrugged. \u201cHey. At least I got a good picture out of the deal.\u201d He pumped his fist in the air. \u201cWorth it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Ladybug rolled her eyes. She tapped his shins. \u201cYeah, yeah, move over.\u201d</p>\n<p>Chat Noir nudged over a little bit and made room for her to sit right next to him. He draped an arm over her shoulder and let her snuggle into his side when the wind on the roof started to pick up. They stayed silent for a few minutes and stared at the excellent view of the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es when Chat Noir suddenly chuckled to himself. \u201cYou wanna know something?\u201d</p>\n<p>Ladybug unconsciously leaned into the vibrations rumbling from his chest. \u201cWhat, you actually have a secret Vine account that you\u2019re not telling me about?\u201d</p>\n<p>He smiled. \u201cNo. Although! That\u2019s a very good idea.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNot in a million years, you with a Vine account is just asking for trouble,\u201d she teased. \u201cBut, you were telling me something.\u201d</p>\n<p>Chat shrugged and leaned his head back against the chimney. \u201cI dunno, I just...were you ever scared of this?\u201d</p>\n<p>Ladybug reached up and tapped on her earrings. \u201cAfraid of this?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p>\n<p>She thought about those first few frightening hours after meeting Tikki and testing out her powers and realizing the gravity of her mistakes after taking up such a powerful and important mantle on behalf of all the citizens of Paris. She remembered the stress, the fear, the uncertainty, and about the mounting responsibility that was suddenly piling on her shoulders, the responsibility she was so afraid to carry. \u201cOf course,\u201d she answered finally. \u201cBut you seemed pretty into it when I first met you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, yeah,\u201d he grinned. \u201cI think it was just finally a chance to let loose in a way I never really did before, but...it scared me too.\u201d</p>\n<p>Ladybug frowned and shifted closer to his side. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI dunno, I guess\u2026\u201d he started. \u201cSaving the city and saving people wasn\u2019t the part that scared me. I always kinda knew that was part of the job.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo what scared you?\u201d</p>\n<p>Chat Noir was idly running his claws along the arm of her suit and making her shiver every time he dragged them back up. His eyes were still fixed on the lights of the city when he answered. \u201cYou, actually.\u201d</p>\n<p>Ladybug blinked up at him. \u201cMe?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe can\u2019t be apart, the two of us,\u201d he explained. \u201cWe can\u2019t fight alone, we can\u2019t find Hawkmoth alone, and we\u2019re partners for a reason. And maybe it was a stupid fear to have because we worked too well together the first time, but I was always just so scared of that moment where we\u2019d stop meshing. Like, there would be one day where one of us would realize that we didn\u2019t like the other, or that we didn\u2019t work well enough together and we\u2019d always have this strange rift between us.\u201d He shrugged and raked his fingers through his hair. \u201cI dunno, I guess I was more afraid of us not working than all of the superhero responsibilities not clicking like they should.\u201d He smirked and turned to her. \u201cIsn\u2019t that weird?\u201d</p>\n<p>Ladybug smiled up at him softly and brushed small bits of hair out of his eyes. \u201cNo,\u201d she promised him. \u201cThat\u2019s not weird. That\u2019s kind of normal actually.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, I know what that\u2019s like,\u201d she explained. \u201cYou meet someone pretty amazing, and...they seem so unlike anyone you\u2019ve ever met before, and you just want to go through everything you can to be friends with them. Get them to notice you, and make it work. And then you just get so scared sometimes because you think you\u2019re not good enough, or you think you\u2019re going to mess something up, and you sort of psych yourself out. I think that happens to a lot of people.\u201d</p>\n<p>Of course it did. Because it happened to her when she looked at Adrien for the first time, and she spent close to a year trying to figure out some way to break through all of her nerves and fears to just walk up to Adrien one day and explain how much she admired him. How much she just wanted to be able to talk to him without being scared of how her next words were going to come out. How much she wanted them to talk and be close and be friends and maybe be something more if everything aligned the way they were supposed to. It seemed like a frustrating reality, but it was almost comforting to know that Adrien felt it too, even just a little bit.</p>\n<p>Ladybug tapped her toes against his boot. \u201cBut that\u2019s the good thing,\u201d she sighed happily. \u201cWe wound up okay. I think no matter what we\u2019re going to be okay. I mean, if we survived through the mess that was a couple of weeks ago, I can\u2019t imagine us not surviving anything else.\u201d</p>\n<p>Chat Noir chuckled. \u201cYeah, that was pretty bad.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd to think you thought yourself so smooth.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHey, what can I say? Sometimes we have our dark moments.\u201d</p>\n<p>Ladybug rolled her eyes at him while he leaned his temple against the top of her head. \u201cAnyway,\u201d Chat continued. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean for that to be a downer, I just wanted to say...well, I\u2019m glad we have this. That nothing\u2019s weird between us and that we can be close like this. I don\u2019t know what I would\u2019ve done if I had lost you. You\u2019re too important to me, Marinette.\u201d</p>\n<p>Her chest was filling with a kind of pressure that Ladybug couldn\u2019t quite pinpoint, but it was making her cheeks warm under her mask and it was making her want to snuggle deeper into Chat\u2019s chest and tell him a flurry of words that had been whirling around in her heart since the moment she\u2019d laid eyes on him. Because, she knew that Chat Noir admired her and couldn\u2019t do without her. But this was Adrien telling Marinette that he needed her and couldn\u2019t do without her, and something about her made her want to laugh out of giddiness and pull him close. \u201cYou\u2019re important to me too, Adrien.\u201d</p>\n<p>Chat held out his fist over their laps and smiled at her warmly. She beamed at the gesture, lifted her own hand, and fist bumped him, the familiar gesture of victory feeling like some sort of strong tie that was finally filling in all the loose spaces between them making them feel complete and inseparable. She couldn\u2019t think of anyone else in the world she\u2019d gotten this close to in such a short amount of time. Even Alya, whom she adored with all of her heart, didn\u2019t know her quite in the way that Chat did. And she understood what he meant instantly \u2014 something this special, this unique, and this powerful, wasn\u2019t something that Marinette ever wanted to jeopardize. If she\u2019d ever lost it, she didn\u2019t think she\u2019d know what to do with herself. It\u2019d be like missing half of herself, and that sort of emptiness seemed too terrifying to risk.</p>\n<p>There was such a strong desire to tilt her head up and place a small kiss on the corner of his mouth. It wouldn\u2019t be hard to reach it, and she was sure if would feel wonderful and right in the moment. But they had this, and this was perfect in a different but equally lovely way. She could keep all that energy secret if it meant being able to sit with him like this.</p>\n<p>She didn\u2019t mind it in the least.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou know, I saw you walking by my house a few weeks ago with a shopping bag full of wheels of camembert. Kind of weird. But now it makes sense.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Adrien gave Marinette a heavy, deadpan stare as he ripped open another wheel of cheese and broke off a chunk to hold out for Plagg to take. \u201cThis has been my life for the past year. Just so you know.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Plagg gently kicked him in the cheek and swallowed half the cheese in one bite. \u201cSo ungrateful! Especially after all I do for you.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Tikki shook her head and spoke through a mouthful of cookies. \u201cIgnore him, Adrien. He\u2019s a baby that needs to have his strange eating habits appeased, and he\u2019s good at making you feel guilty for not indulging him.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Plagg sent a glare towards Tikki. \u201cOh, </span>\n<em>\n<span>I\u2019m</span>\n</em>\n<span> sorry, Ms. Sweet Tooth. Still inhaling pounds of sugar on a daily basis, aren\u2019t we?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI don\u2019t eat as much as you do,\u201d Tikki huffed. \u201cBesides, you\u2019re just jealous that Marinette lives above a bakery and has way too many cookies left over at the end of the day for me to eat.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cMy boy comes from </span>\n<em>\n<span>money</span>\n</em>\n<span>, Tikki. He can buy me as much cheese as I want.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cMost would rather smell like cookies than camembert cheese. Your food cravings have historically smelled horrid. Your poor charges...\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou take that back! Camembert smells delicious!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Adrien winced. \u201cOkay.\u201d He plucked Plagg up by the scruff of his neck and placed him up on one of the shelves of the utility closet they were all sitting in. \u201cIf you\u2019re not gonna play nice, then you have to sit up here.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Plagg frowned. \u201cTikki started it!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOh, you\u2019re thousands of years old,\u201d Tikki scolded. \u201cYou could act a little more mature.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Marinette tapped on the top of Tikki\u2019s head and handed her another cookie. \u201cOkay, you two. Don\u2019t make us put you in the mop bucket so that you can bicker. Again.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Tikki turned her nose up, took a bite of her cookie, and floated up to the shelf right across from Plagg, making faces at him the entire time. Plagg pulled his cheeks apart, made a rude sound, and purposefully took a gigantic bite out of his cheese to spite her. Adrien rolled his eyes, put the rest of the cheese wheel next to Plagg on the shelf, and turned to Marinette with an exasperated smile. \u201cSo, how much time left until class?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Marinette laughed and checked her phone. \u201cLike twenty more minutes, they\u2019ve still got time to eat.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Adrien sighed and slumped against the wall of the closet. \u201cYou\u2019re so lucky. Cookies are so cheap. Do you know how weird it is for Natalie to look at my credit card statements and see all these orders of gourmet cheese? She thinks I\u2019m eating it all for myself and ruining my diet. I still haven\u2019t come up with a good enough excuse for it.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Marinette snorted. \u201cWhat excuse have you been using this whole time?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Adrien looked down at his feet. \u201c...my fencing team really likes cheese platters?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThat was the best you could do?\u201d she chuckled. \u201cMan, you weren\u2019t kidding, you\u2019re really bad under pressure.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Adrien pointed at her. \u201c</span>\n<em>\n<span>Social</span>\n</em>\n<span> pressure.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cRight, it must be terrifying to be put on the spot by your peers about your cheese purchasing habits.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThere\u2019s so much stigma, Mari,\u201d Adrien said, shaking his head sadly. \u201cIt\u2019s really hard to talk about it publically like this.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Marinette leaned back against the mop bucket at her back and felt her entire body shaking with laughter. It wasn\u2019t the best hiding space they\u2019d ever thought of \u2014 it was a tight fit, there was a lot of cleaning equipment that was crowding the closet, and the shelves above them were so overfilled that they wound up having to sit on the floor in order to spread their legs out \u2014 but it was the first door that Adrien opened up when they had snuck back into the school to detransform, recharge their kwamis, and leave them just enough time to sneak back into class. She had to remember to insist that she\u2019d pick their hiding place next time. She was pretty confident her good luck would come up with something a little bit more comfortable. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>She wanted to say that the close quarters wasn\u2019t bothering her, and in a way they weren\u2019t. It wasn\u2019t as if she was a stranger to being close to Adrien anymore. Leaning her head on his shoulder or having him hug her around the waist from behind was just what they did and Ladybug had been dealing with that kind of intimacy with Chat Noir since very early on in their relationship. But there was something decidedly different from being this close to each other out of choice and being this close due to circumstances out of their control. Most of the touching they did during the day was very unconscious and was always mitigated by bickering and joking and talking which Marinette could concentrate on more. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>But for some reason, she was heavily aware of his leg pressed along the length of her own, the fact that she could reach her arm across and only have to lean forward just a touch in order to brush the tip of his nose, the sounds of his every inhale and exhale coming from his nose. It made her want to press her leg closer to his, or reach out and touch him for no other reason than that she could. She was afraid if she thought on it too much, the uncertainty would show on her face, and sitting as close as they were Adrien might see it. So she swallowed back her thoughts and tried to focus on something else. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Suddenly remembering their battle, Marinette nudged Adrien\u2019s knee with her own and pointed to her ribs. \u201cAre you okay, by the way? That was a pretty nasty hit you took at the end.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Adrien frowned and lifted up the side of his shirt, prodding the skin along his ribs. \u201cI think so. Still a little sore, but no bruises. Thank you, magic.\u201d He pointed a finger to his temple. \u201cHow\u2019s the head?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Marinette shrugged and tucked her hair behind her ear. \u201cJust a little bit of a headache. It could\u2019ve been a lot worse.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou scared me for a second back there,\u201d Adrien frowned. \u201cYou weren\u2019t moving for a few seconds when you landed. I thought something bad had happened.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Marinette winced. She was tired from the night before and wasn\u2019t paying as much attention, which meant the akuma got a good hit in and smacked her clean against a building where her head took the majority of the blow. It left her dizzy for a few seconds, and she had to really try to catch her bearings, but her senses came back to her quick enough and she was business as usual. \u201cI\u2019m fine, I promise,\u201d she assured. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI know you are,\u201d Adrien smiled. \u201cI mean, magical properties of our suits aside, I know I shouldn\u2019t worry about you.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Marinette smirked. \u201cShouldn\u2019t?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI do anyway,\u201d Adrien muttered. \u201cI mean, I\u2019ve always known we were just regular people underneath the masks, but it\u2019s different knowing exactly who that regular person is.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cDifferent how?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Adrien chuckled and propped one of his knees up and started drumming his fingers on his knee cap. \u201cI dunno, it\u2019ll probably sound weird if I try and explain it.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI have the utmost confidence in you,\u201d Marinette assured. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOh, I don\u2019t know,\u201d he sighed, trying to get his words together. \u201cLadybug always seemed like this indestructible person, you know? Like no matter what, superhero or civilian form, I always sort of knew she was going to be okay and knew she\u2019d kick my ass if I bothered fussing over her.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Marinette nodded with a grin. \u201cAccurate.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cBut with you\u2026\u201dAdrien sighed heavily. \u201cSomething about us walking away from battles and just seeing you sitting there in class, taking notes and just being normal...I start to think of </span>\n<em>\n<span>that</span>\n</em>\n<span> girl getting flung across the city and slammed against buildings and it makes me restless.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The mood suddenly switched between them, and Marinette suddenly felt pressed to give a serious answer. She wrinkled her nose in thought and stared down at the place where their legs were still touching. \u201cI\u2019m not actually getting hurt you know,\u201d she promised him. \u201cYou know that better than anyone.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cStill,\u201d he said. \u201cI always want to know that you\u2019re okay. Moreso than usual now. And I\u2019m trying to figure out why that is and the only explanation that I can come up with is that...Ladybug has a humanness to her now. I mean, she\u2019s you. And seeing you in danger really bothers me. Makes me feel like I need to go out of my way to protect you.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhich you don\u2019t,\u201d Marinette said sternly. \u201cBecause you don\u2019t need to be putting yourself in unnecessary danger, and I can handle myself.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNo one knows that better than I do, I swear,\u201d Adrien grinned. \u201cIt\u2019s just...I\u2019ve always cared about what happens to you. But now I really </span>\n<em>\n<span>really</span>\n</em>\n<span> care. So much so that our battles are getting scary again. I guess I\u2019m still trying to mesh Ladybug and Marinette in my head a little. Like Ladybug I know can take a blow to the head no problem, but Marinette?\u201d He stopped for a moment and moved his leg closer to hers. \u201cMarinette makes me feel like it\u2019s our first battle all over again. And I\u2019m excited, but just a little scared because this is still new to us, and we put our lives on the line every day and...I don\u2019t want anything to happen to you.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>He paused for a moment and laughed at himself, as if he couldn\u2019t believe what had just come out of his mouth. \u201cSorry, that was a lot. I hope you don\u2019t see it as me fussing or me not trusting that you can take care of yourself. It\u2019s just how I feel.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>It was a lot, but Marinette didn\u2019t mind it in the least. In fact, she was pretty sure she could listen to him go on about how much he wanted to protect her and keep her safe for as long as they could manage to stay in this closet together. In fact, she wished she had her phone out so that she could\u2019ve recorded the whole thing and played it back for whenever she wanted to hear his voice again, or was ever unclear about what went through Adrien\u2019s head when he thought of her. It made her smile so wide that her cheeks were tingling and she covered her mouth with her hand to cover the stray giggles. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Adrien was wiping his hands on his jeans and whistled a short little tune. \u201cSo, yeah, great job Adrien, you made the mood way too heavy, so uuhhhh\u2026.how\u2019s the weather looking tomorrow?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Marinette cackled and hit her elbow too hard on the wall behind her. \u201cI think it\u2019s clear skies tomorrow,\u201d she chortled. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOh good,\u201d Adrien nodded enthusiastically. \u201cThat had been bothering me all week.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOh, I\u2019m sure.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYup! Rain makes me nervous.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIt\u2019s because you\u2019re a cat. Isn\u2019t it?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cLow hanging proof. And wow, that felt like a personal attack.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Marinette said nothing and winked at him, making the two of them dissolve into more laughter that Marinette hopes wasn\u2019t catching the attention of anyone from the hallway. The air was getting stuffy and her hair was starting to stick uncomfortably to the back of her neck, but Marinette didn\u2019t mind it in the least. Adrien\u2019s hair was all askew and she was pretty sure they were both getting dust all over their clothes, and it was all just fine and perfect, nothing wrong. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Adrien was wiping tears out from under his eyes when Marinette sobered up enough to tell him, \u201cYou\u2019re not the only one who feels that way. I care about what happens to you all the time.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>He was still panting from the exertion, but he was staring at her intensely. \u201cReally?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI always did,\u201d Marinette elaborated. \u201cBut, I get what you mean, I do. There\u2019s a face behind the mask now. A face I know. And all those protective feelings got twice as strong. But that\u2019s not a bad thing. If anything, it just comes with the territory now I guess.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cGood,\u201d Adrien smiled softly. \u201cBecause I really do care about you.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>God, and that just melted right through her and made Marinette bite into her lip so hard just to force back the noise that might have come out of her mouth at the sound of those words. Because she knew all that, she did, of course they cared about each other, they wouldn\u2019t be fit to call each other partners if they didn\u2019t. But something about Adrien looking so pure and disheveled in front of her, letting the words slip out like an afterthought, like it wasn\u2019t a hard thought to make, like it was so damn obvious...all that felt too good. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Suddenly something Alya said came back into her head. That her feelings weren\u2019t self destructive. That they didn\u2019t have the power to ruin anything. In moments like this, that very much felt true, because nothing that felt this good could possibly be bad, it just wasn\u2019t how things worked. Some insanely idiotic part of her brain started to force her mouth open, make her look like she was prepared to say something, something that could quite possibly ruin everything or make everything perfect. Probably the former if her luck was to be trusted. Usually, it was such an easy task to shut it up and move on like normal, but Marinette wasn\u2019t closing her mouth, wasn\u2019t pushing the thoughts away, felt like doing something stupid, because why not? They were in a closet by themselves. It was Friday. It was a nice day out. Why not?</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cMarinette?\u201d\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>She blinked at Adrien who was staring at her curiously. \u201cWhat?\u201d she forced out. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou looked like you wanted to say something\u2026\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Marinette licked her lips, bit the inside of her cheek, and heard herself chanting in her head. </span>\n<em>\n<span>Tell him. It\u2019ll all be fine. Tell him. </span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>But her nerves had always been stronger than her head, always made her overthink, always made her second guess, and now, made her shake her head and smile reassuringly at Adrien. \u201cNothing,\u201d she told him. \u201cJust lost my thought.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Adrien didn\u2019t look like he wanted to push the issue, and was distracted by the cheese crumbs that Plagg had decided at that moment to unceremoniously shove off the shelf and make land in Adrien\u2019s hair. Adrien twisted his whole body around, glared up at the shelf, and watched Plagg innocently shrug his shoulders. \u201cWhat?\u201d he said innocently. \u201cYou two were getting all mushy down there, I was suffocating!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIn my hair,\u201d Adrien sighed tiredly. \u201cAlways in my hair. Why?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI don\u2019t have reasons for the things I do, Adrien, I just do them.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>By the time Marinette helped Adrien get all the bits of cheese out of his locks, it was already time for them to head back to class. They tucked their kwamis away, quickly looked both ways down each end of the hallway, and slid into the hall to walk to their next class as discreetly as they could. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>On their way back, Adrien had completely forgotten about the huge Literature review they were going to have in class today about the book they just finished, which meant that Madame Bustier was probably going to spend much of the period randomly calling on students to ask them about the last few chapters of the book they read. So they walked into the classroom with Adrien\u2019s arm around Marinette\u2019s shoulder, leaning down close to her face so that he could read her short review sheet that she was showing him on her tablet. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>They\u2019d walked into class around ten minutes early like that, not looking at the rest of the students who were quietly reviewing. Adrien was skimming while Marinette was answering some of his occasional questions, and neither of them even batted a lash when Marinette sat down in her own seat and scooted over just a bit to let Adrien share. Alya and Nino looked at the two of them, shared a private laugh, and ignored them in favor of their own conversation. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>If anyone else in the class had anything to say about it, Marinette and Adrien either didn\u2019t notice or didn\u2019t particularly care. By now, their closeness was a common if not strange occurrence nowadays, and many people just watched from afar with little amused smiles or left them to their own devices. Of course, the one and only possible exception to that rule had decided at that moment to come busting into the classroom, gossiping loudly with Sabrina about the new cell phone her father had just gotten her for her birthday last week. \u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAdrien, darling!\u201d Chloe cooed, quickly jogging up the steps to stand next to Adrien. She smiled too widely and brushed his bangs away from his eyes. \u201cSabrina told me there\u2019s an awful review happening in class today. Let\u2019s go study together!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>But Adrien moved his head away from her hand and looked up at her apologetically. \u201cSorry, Chloe, but uh...I\u2019m studying with Marinette already. She\u2019s letting me use her review sheet.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Marinette tried not to smile victoriously at the rejection, but Chloe was that type of person that really didn\u2019t have to do anything more than breathe in order to rile Marinette\u2019s annoyance and make her want to get her as far away as possible. As if to further emphasize Adrien\u2019s point, she pretended as if Chloe wasn\u2019t even there and grabbed his hand that was slung over her shoulder, pulling Adrien just a couple of inches closer to her, not bothering to look up from her tablet. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Chloe didn\u2019t seem to take any of this as a deterrence. \u201cWell, Sabrina spent all night making a fabulous review sheet that\u2019s pretty much got anything you\u2019d ever want to know on it. Guarantee you it\u2019s much more detailed than Marinette\u2019s over here. If you want to do well today, you should come over and look at it with me.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Adrien\u2019s brow furrowed, but Marinette was quicker to respond. \u201cMy review sheet is just fine, thank you very much. And </span>\n<em>\n<span>we\u2019re</span>\n</em>\n<span> also doing just fine sitting here and studying by ourselves. So you can go ahead and leave now.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Chloe scoffed. \u201cWell, excuse me, Ms. Dupain-Cheng, but I believe I was talking to Adrien.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWell, so was I,\u201d Marinette snapped back. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to review for class today, and you\u2019re distracting us. So if you don\u2019t mind, the two of us would very much like to get back to it.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Adrien shifted in his seat in discomfort, and struggled with his words before answering. \u201cLook, Chloe,\u201d he said softly. \u201cWe can talk later, alright? Or maybe we can study for maths sometime later. But I\u2019d rather study with Marinette.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAnd why on Earth would you want to study with her when I\u2019m right over here?\u201d Chloe said with her hands on her hips. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Marinette smirked and muttered under her breath. \u201cMaybe because I\u2019m much better company\u2026\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Chloe had clearly heard it because she slapped her hands on the table and leaned over the desk until her face was only about a foot away from Marinette\u2019s. \u201cIs there something you\u2019d like to share with the class, Marinette?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Adrien was squeezing Marinette\u2019s hand, probably his silent way of telling her not to get involved, but Marinette was never able to leave well enough alone when Chloe was involved, especially when she expected a direct challenge to her words. So Marinette calmly unwound herself from Adrien\u2019s grasp, slid out of out her seat, and stood in front of Chloe with her chin up high and her face schooled. She replied calmly and loudly, \u201cI said that the reason anyone would prefer studying with me over you is because I\u2019m exceedingly better company than you are. Which isn\u2019t surprising when you consider how you treat people on a daily basis.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Chloe\u2019s nose was wrinkling in anger, and her shoulders were bunching up in that way they did when she was two seconds away from letting loose a serious tantrum. \u201cWell look at who\u2019s deciding to be all high and mighty just because Adrien is pitying her with some attention. Now all of a sudden you think you\u2019re better than everyone else?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Marinette chuckled. \u201cThe words never came out of my mouth,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd if you\u2019re trying to bait me into thinking that time spent with me is just an act of pity, then you\u2019re going to have to try a little bit harder than that to bother me.\u201d She glanced a quick look at the clock above the door. \u201cSix minutes left before class. I\u2019d very much like to keep helping Adrien study if that\u2019s alright with you.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>She was about to turn back to her seat and ignore Chloe until the start of class before the other girl laughed harshly and garnered the attention of the entire class. Marinette turned back to her with an eye roll and saw Chloe staring at her with a knowing glint in her eyes. \u201cYou think you\u2019re so worth his time, don\u2019t you? And you dare call </span>\n<em>\n<span>me</span>\n</em>\n<span> someone not worth hanging out with?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Marinette smirked. \u201cIf there\u2019s a point you\u2019re trying to get at, you might want to hurry up and do it. Class is going to start soon.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>She wasn\u2019t taking Chloe\u2019s condescension seriously. And maybe she should\u2019ve, because Chloe merely crossed her arms and spoke as if she\u2019d finally discovered her trump card. \u201cI\u2019ll bet he wouldn\u2019t even look at you if he knew how you </span>\n<em>\n<span>really</span>\n</em>\n<span> felt.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d Marinette responded tiredly. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIt\u2019s funny you should ask,\u201d Chloe tittered. \u201cBecause a little while ago, Sabrina told me about some very </span>\n<em>\n<span>interesting</span>\n</em>\n<span> things she saw in your room while she was there.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Marinette rolled her eyes. \u201cWhat on Earth are you talking \u2014- ?\u201d And then she froze in the middle of her sentence because she remembered. The time when the two of them were battling it out for the class representative position. The time where Chloe sent Sabrina to her house to snoop around her room and try to grab her diary. The diary might\u2019ve been safe, but Sabrina had definitely seen her room. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>She\u2019d seen her </span>\n<em>\n<span>room</span>\n</em>\n<span>. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The discomfort must have been showing on her face because Chloe\u2019s smile only got wider. \u201cAh, I see you know what I\u2019m talking about,\u201d she laughed. \u201cHonestly, it was sort of pathetic in a cute way when Sabrina told me, but looking back on it now, it\u2019s just plain old creepy. I mean, Jesus...pictures plastered all over your wall? How sick can you get?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cShut up,\u201d Marinette said through gritted teeth. \u201cThat was and is none of your business.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOh I think it very well is, </span>\n<em>\n<span>Marinette</span>\n</em>\n<span>,\u201d Chloe sneered. \u201cBecause weirdoes don\u2019t get to monopolize on my Adrien\u2019s time. In fact, they should stay far away from him.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Alya must have sensed where the conversation was going because she immediately stood up her seat and glared in the girl\u2019s direction. \u201cChloe, you shut your mouth about that, or I swear to God\u2026\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou\u2019ll do what? Tackle me? Gag me? You can\u2019t do anything to me.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cChloe,\u201d Adrien said sternly from his seat. \u201cEnough. Just let it go. Class is about to start.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNo,\u201d she snarled. \u201cBecause Marinette here seems to think that she\u2019s so worthy of your time and so deserving of your attention, when in reality she\u2019s some freak who has your damn face plastered all over her walls like a serial killer.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Marinette saw Adrien blink out of the corner of her eyes, and she was already feeling her heart drop to her stomach. \u201cChloe\u2026\u201d she forced out. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOh yeah, did no one else know?\u201d she announced to the entire class. \u201cFreakin\u2019 desktop picture is just his face with hearts all over it like she\u2019s in primary school. And let\u2019s not even </span>\n<em>\n<span>talk</span>\n</em>\n<span> about that ridiculous calendar you have of his entire schedule. I mean, talk about a stalker, huh? She\u2019s totally obsessed and frankly it\u2019s downright pitiful that you\u2019d sink that low over someone who was completely out of your league.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201c</span>\n<em>\n<span>Chloe!!\u201d</span>\n</em>\n<span> Alya shouted. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOh don\u2019t pretend like you don\u2019t know about it,\u201d Chloe said back to her. \u201cAdmit it. This girl thinks she\u2019s a gift to have graced this entire classroom, when in reality she\u2019s a freak who\u2019d sooner swoon over the little altars in her room than actually treat someone like a normal person! Honestly, what a bizarre way to crush on someone.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The entire classroom rung in silence and no one could say anything or even will themselves to move. Marinette\u2019s entire body felt numb, because she\u2019d had nightmares about this sort of thing, dreaded the day where Adrien would find out about something so embarrassing, dreaded when the whole class would find out about this sort of thing, and spent hours swearing Alya to secrecy about it just for cover. Now it was just hanging out in the room for everyone to look at, prod at, laugh at, and Marinette felt like she wanted to die. The backs of her eyes were building up with tears that she didn\u2019t want to let fall in front of everyone, and she didn\u2019t even know what to say to recover. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>She didn\u2019t want to see Adrien\u2019s face. Didn\u2019t want to see his reaction. Didn\u2019t want to see anyone\u2019s reaction. Because in a weird way, Chloe was right. She treated him like an oddity and not an actual person, and she had spent much of these past two weeks realizing how cruel that was to Adrien. Those pictures were gone. That calendar was gone. She\u2019d learned. She knew it wasn\u2019t a fair way to treat someone. But she\u2019d just had that point blown back up and thrown in her face, and Marinette suddenly felt sick to her stomach. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cChloe, what the </span>\n<em>\n<span>hell</span>\n</em>\n<span> is your problem!?\u201d she heard Adrien shout, the loudest she\u2019d ever heard him raise his voice to Chloe. Not that Marinette cared. Everything was out there and in the open and she just felt horribly exposed and on display. Her breathing was starting to quicken as everyone started shifting and as little whispers started dotting up around the classroom. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>She needed to leave. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>She needed to leave right now. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Marinette shoved Chloe out of the way, ran down the stairs to the front of the classroom, and barrelled out of the door, passing her teacher along the way. She could vaguely hear Alya, Nino, and a few of her other classmates calling after her, but Marinette didn\u2019t want to talk to any of them. She walked down the empty hallway, not sure where she was going, rubbing at her eyes and hoping, praying that her tears wouldn\u2019t fall until she locked herself in the bathroom and never came out. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>She was almost around the corner when she heard someone chasing after her. \u201cMarinette! Marinette, come on, wait, please!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Her entire body wanted to curl in on itself because, for once, Adrien was the last person she wanted to see right now. So she ignored his calls and started running down the rest of the hallway. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>But Adrien wasn\u2019t going to leave her alone, and his legs were longer, and he could run faster, so he easily caught up to her in the middle of the hallway, ran in front of her, and held both of her shoulders in his hands to get her to stop. He bent down a little so that they were face to face. \u201cMarinette, please, come on, talk to me. It\u2019s just me.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The calm, understanding in his voice made a sob escape from her throat without her meaning for it to, and it just made her want to sink into the floor even more and pretend she didn\u2019t exist. \u201cPlease, let me go,\u201d she said, her voice thick with tears that desperately wanted to fall. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cPlease, wait, Mari,\u201d Adrien soothed, using his pet name for her to try and get her to calm down. His fingers were rubbing circles into her shoulders and she could see the confusion and confliction on his face. \u201cWas...was any of that true?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Marinette dropped her head and swallowed the huge lump in her throat, but Adrien shook her gently to try and get her to look at him again. \u201cPlease, Mari, I just want to know, so I can go say something to Chloe \u2014 \u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNo!\u2019 Marinette insisted. \u201cI mean\u2026.yes, a little, I mean\u2026.I don\u2019t know.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Adrien bit his bottom lip. \u201cMari, you\u2019re not making any sense\u2026\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>She stomped her foot petulantly and looked at him angrily. \u201cGod, </span>\n<em>\n<span>yes!</span>\n</em>\n<span> Okay, fine! Yes! It was all true! I had a gigantic crush on you, and it was huge, and embarrassing, and childish, and yes! Okay?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Marinette stepped away from him while he straightened up and stared at her with an expression she didn\u2019t recognize, an expression she couldn\u2019t read. \u201cBut that was before I got to know you,\u201d she kept going. \u201cA-And I found out that you were Chat, and you weren\u2019t this perfect, amazing boy that sat in front of me, you were a person with flaws, a-and feelings, and I realized how unfair that was to put you on a pedestal like that. S-So I ripped everything down, and I hid it away, because it wasn\u2019t </span>\n<em>\n<span>like</span>\n</em>\n<span> that anymore\u2026\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>She was crying. She couldn\u2019t see past her tears. All of the feelings mounting up inside of her were making the words just spill out on their own. She was rubbing the balls of her hands under her eyes to make the tears stop coming down. Adrien wasn\u2019t saying anything, and Marinette didn\u2019t know how else to salvage this. This is what she\u2019d been afraid of. This was everything falling apart. This was everything being ruined. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Adrien swallowed, and found his voice. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you\u2026?\u201d he trailed off. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou weren\u2019t supposed to know,\u201d Marinette sniffled. \u201cThis wasn\u2019t supposed to happen, I </span>\n<em>\n<span>never</span>\n</em>\n<span> wanted you to know! Because of this! Because it ruined everything, everything is messed up now, and I can\u2019t fix it.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWait, wait, come on, there\u2019s nothing for you to fix,\u201d Adrien tried to soothe. \u201cMarinette \u2014 \u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>She was still backing away from him. \u201cI didn\u2019t want you to know,\u201d she repeated. \u201cWe were friends, things were normal, and it was fine, everything was fine. That\u2019s all I wanted, I just wanted us to be friends, I didn\u2019t want it all to get all messed up. Nothing had to change.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Marinette would have almost preferred if he\u2019d been immediately embarrassed or disgusted by her. If he never wanted to see her again, or she\u2019d gone and probably freaked him out enough that he wanted to just keep his distance from her and leave her alone to wallow by herself. It was this understanding, calm Adrien that didn\u2019t make sense. The Adrien with a facial expression that she couldn\u2019t for one second decode, and that scared her even more. She could always read his face. They were so good at that, because they needed to be, because they needed to understand each other, that was the whole nature of their relationship. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>But there were mixes of worry, pity, hurt, confusion, and so many other emotions that when clumped together didn\u2019t make any sort of sense. Was he angry? Relieved? She couldn\u2019t tell. And she very much didn\u2019t want to know. Things were slipping through her fingers and she didn\u2019t want to see him. She didn\u2019t want to see anyone. She just wanted to be alone. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>So she turned around, forgot her plans to go sob in the bathroom, and instead headed for the courtyard so she could get back home. Alya could get her things later. She didn\u2019t have the energy to go back for them. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>But Adrien was still following behind her, still pleading with her. \u201cMarinette, </span>\n<em>\n<span>talk </span>\n</em>\n<span>to me \u2014 \u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>She whirled around and screamed, \u201cJust leave me </span>\n<em>\n<span>alone!!!</span>\n</em>\n<span>\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>That shocked him back within himself. He stopped in the middle of the hallway, his hand still outstretched like he was about to reach out for her again, and his eyes widened in shock and hurt. Some deep part of her wanted to go up to him, hug him, hold him close, tell him that it wasn\u2019t his fault, it was entirely her own. But looking at him hurt now, bubbled up all the shame in her chest, and she just wanted to make it all stop. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>So Marinette left him standing there in the hallway, and didn\u2019t stop running until she made it back to her room. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<span>\u201cAre you sure you don\u2019t want me to come over? I can bring my blanket and we can just snuggle all day. We don\u2019t even have to talk.\u201d</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Marinette smiled sadly and pulled her quilt up until it was tucked underneath her nose. \u201cNo thanks, Alya. Really, I\u2019d rather just be alone today.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<span>\u201cWe can make fun of me trying to use that nail art set you bought me since you\u2019re so much better at it than I am\u2026\u201d</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Marinette snorted. \u201cMaybe another time. Although I would really love to see you try your hand at that again. It was pretty funny. You were getting the paint everywhere.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<span>\u201cHey, your nails didn\u2019t look that bad.\u201d</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNo, they didn\u2019t,\u201d Marinette promised. Marinette had turned her phone off the minute she got home yesterday afternoon. She passed her parents, threw on her largest, comfiest, most unflattering clothing, and buried herself in her bed all day, trying to keep her crying as quiet as she could so that she wouldn\u2019t alert her parents. But by the time school let out, Alya had come to her house and into her room with her school bag, all of her homework for the weekend, and a promise from her teacher that she could redo her Literature review on Monday when she was feeling better. The good thing about Alya was that, even though she was always eager to hear about Marinette\u2019s drama, she also knew when it was time to say nothing. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>They curled up on Marinette\u2019s lounger, watched re-runs of Project Runway and old romcoms that Alya left in Marinette\u2019s room and never took home, and stuffed their faces with all of the cookies that were still in the display cases downstairs that her parents hadn\u2019t gotten around to selling. She\u2019d even brought over the nail art kit that Marinette had gotten her for her birthday and watched Alya make a mess trying to draw ladybugs on her nails. They were lumpy and already chipping when she woke up this morning, but the effort spoke volumes. Yesterday was a long afternoon of Marinette moping and not being very good company, but Alya let her cry when she needed to and handed her tissues and sweets when appropriate. Alya didn\u2019t leave until late that night and tucked Marinette into bed before she left, promising she\u2019d call her in the morning. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>She had to admit. It almost helped. But the entire time Alya was there, a huge, sick pressure was just building up through her stomach and spreading through her chest that was just begging her to properly sob until she had no tears left. And when Alya finally left, she finally indulged and kept her face buried in her pillow until she woke up the next morning, groggy and red-eyed. She just wanted to stay in bed today. Not even designing was going to make her feel better. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<span>\u201cWell...if you\u2019re sure</span>\n</em>\n<span>,\u201d Alya said worriedly over the phone. </span>\n<em>\n<span>\u201cBut if you need anything, I\u2019m a bike ride away. I\u2019ll drop everything and come over. I promise.\u201d</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThanks,\u201d Marinette sniffled. \u201cI really appreciate it. Honest.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<span>\u201cOf course, girlie. And...I don\u2019t know if this will help much but...no one was gossiping after you left, I promise. Everyone was more worried about you and mad at Chloe. And every time Chloe opened her mouth to say something, I shut it down real quick.\u201d</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Alya wouldn\u2019t lie about something like that, but the embarrassment was still sinking in her gut and making her feel dizzy. Still, something was something. \u201cThanks, Alya.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Alya sighed over the phone. </span>\n<em>\n<span>\u201cWell...get some rest, alright? I\u2019ll call you a little later. Miss you.\u201d</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cMiss you too,\u201d Marinette muttered. They sent each other a few kisses over the phone before Marinette hung up and finished pulling the quilt over her head until there was only a small sliver of space where she could still peek out and let air in. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>She\u2019d managed to push off her parents by pretending she was sick, and only had to endure the occasional bowl of soup and cups of tea that her mother kept bringing up to her room. It let her stay in bed for as long as she wanted, and that\u2019s what Marinette desperately needed today and probably well into tomorrow. That left Monday, but Marinette would cross that bridge when she got there. She knew it was bad to avoid problems at school by faking sick or just flat out skipping out, but there was something so overwhelming about facing everyone the next day, despite Alya\u2019s assurances. It was less that she was afraid people were going to say something and more that they just knew. It was in their minds, they\u2019d heard everything Chloe had said, and that was enough for Marinette. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Besides, worst of all, there was Adrien. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Marinette groaned and pulled her pillow closer. She didn\u2019t mean to yell at him, not at all. But she didn\u2019t want to have to see his face any longer and wait for it to morph into an expression that would break her heart. A part of her wanted to answer his texts and his calls to tell him that it wasn\u2019t his fault, that it was all her, that he didn\u2019t do anything to deserve her frustration. But the thought of talking to him at this point was what was making her tears come back up and making her want to disappear into her sheets and never come out. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>During the past few weeks, she was starting to </span>\n<em>\n<span>like</span>\n</em>\n<span> him again. It was slower this time, smoldering instead of striking through her without warning, but it was still real. Her head wasn\u2019t being filled with lofty, domestic daydreams of their future wedding, their three perfect children, their pets, their house, their jobs, their lives, and their happily ever afters. If anything, Marinette hadn\u2019t thought about that sort of thing in a long time. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Marinette wanted Adrien to lean his chin on her shoulder while he read over her shoulder. Marinette wanted Adrien to interrupt their patrols with all of the puns he came up with in the middle of class, and laugh at him while he went on about how proud he was of himself \u2014 \u201cEighteen puns in half an hour, Mari, that\u2019s gotta go in some kind of record book or something.\u201d Marinette wanted to keep bringing him sweets late at night, scolding him for not keeping his diet, and trying to explain to him that she couldn\u2019t just write down the recipes for him, they were family secrets and he\u2019d have to just keep coming back. Marinette </span>\n<em>\n<span>wanted</span>\n</em>\n<span> Adrien to keep coming back. Wanted to see him smile when she walked into a classroom. Wanted to play truth or dare with him at Notre Dame. Wanted to fall asleep on his shoulder while they sat on the edge of a roof late at night, their legs dangling over the edge, counting the cobblestones until she dozed off. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Wanted their hugs to last longer. Wanted to be able to hold his hand when their shoulders bumped in the hallway. Wanted to stand on her toes one day and just kiss him because all of the affection that she felt for him was going to burst one day in a flurry of warm, gooey, good feelings, and she wanted desperately to have somewhere to put them all. She wanted to find someway to show him how much she cared for him, how much she wanted him around, how much she cherished the fact that he was in her life and that they were always going to be together. Always. Forever. Ladybug and Chat Noir. Adrien and Marinette. No one could contradict it. No one needed to understand it. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Marinette wasn\u2019t sure if that was liking, loving, friendship, some strange mix of the three, or some brand new hybrid feeling that she\u2019d never felt for anyone before. But they\u2019d revealed themselves to each other only a little over a month ago, and it took until now for Marinette to realize that she liked feeling this way. She wanted to keep feeling this way. Finally, it felt right and normal and like it should\u2019ve. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>In the closet yesterday, she almost said all that. She could\u2019ve said it then and maybe everything wouldn\u2019t have turned out awful. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Because Adrien didn\u2019t know all that now. He knew only about the embarrassing girl in his class who knew his entire schedule front to back but didn\u2019t know his favorite sweets or when he liked to take naps. The girl who had his entire face memorized from his dimples to the shape of his jaw but didn\u2019t know that those posed smiles were fractions smaller than the smiles he was capable of. The girl who imagined an entire future with him and didn\u2019t know what kind of future Adrien actually wanted for himself, her childish daydreams aside. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>He\u2019d see the girl who was only enchanted by what she could scratch at the surface, and didn\u2019t bother to look any deeper than that. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>And why would you ever bother trying to like a person who could do that to you? Why would you even want to be friends with them?</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Fighting was going to be awkward. School was going to be awkward. Patrols were going to be awkward. Just seeing him was going to be awkward. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>No. Worse than awkward. Unbearable. Horrifying. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>It made her stomach start doing flips inside of her and her tears started welling up again. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cDammit,\u201d she muttered into her comforter, using her sheets to wipe her tears again. \u201cThis isn\u2019t fair. I don\u2019t know what to do\u2026\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>She felt something against her fingertips and opened her eyes to see Tikki poking her head in through the opening she left in her quilt, laying her hands on Marinette\u2019s finger, and staring at her worriedly. \u201cYou were tossing around again,\u201d she said quietly. \u201cI just wanted to make sure you were okay.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Marinette didn\u2019t bother scrubbing her eyes but she lowered her quilt, held her hand out, and let Tikki sit in the middle of her palm. \u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d she said rather unconvincingly. \u201cI\u2019m just...letting my thoughts get to me again.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Tikki nodded sadly. \u201cI can imagine there\u2019s a lot going through your head. I understand.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Marinette rubbed her finger on the top of Tikki\u2019s head and smiled a bit when she saw the kwami roll up into the touch. \u201cAren\u2019t you going to say anything?\u201d Marinette asked. \u201cYou\u2019re usually always here with some thousand-year-old, wise, seasoned advice for all of my silly little problems.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYour problems aren\u2019t silly, Marinette,\u201d Tikki said. \u201cDon\u2019t ever think that your feelings are insignificant. Everyone feels what they feel, and that\u2019s not anything to dismiss.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cSo what do I do about what I\u2019m feeling?\u201d Marinette asked, hoping desperately her kwami had answers if only it meant that she could finally do something about all of this. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Tikki looked down at the lines on Marinette\u2019s hand, and sighed before she answered. \u201cI think,\u201d she began. \u201cThat there are some days when you need a good cry, no matter any voices of reason that try to break through it.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Marinette snorted. \u201cEven if the crying is just ugly and unproductive?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou had a rough day yesterday,\u201d Tikki soothed, rubbing her hand against Marinette\u2019s thumb. \u201cYou deserve to be upset about it. Besides, I don\u2019t think I\u2019m the person you need to be talking to.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>She floated closer to Marinette and placed a small kiss on her cheek \u201cBut come on,\u201d Tikki said. \u201cFirst thing\u2019s first, you look exhausted. Get some more sleep.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Marinette frowned and tucked the covers tightly around her again. \u201cThere\u2019s too much in my head for me to be tired\u2026\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cTrust me,\u201d Tikki promised. \u201cSleep helps almost everything.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Marinette stubbornly tried her best to stay awake, coming up with ridiculous gimmicks in her head about how she could try and face Adrien in school again, how she could maybe keep convincing her parents that she was sick so that she\u2019d never have to leave her bed and go to school ever again, maybe figure out a way to switch this whole story that Chloe said the other day in her favor and convince people that it wasn\u2019t true. But all it was doing was making her tired, and the overcast weather outside was darkening her room and making it far too easy to slip off into sleep again. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>She vaguely remembered her mother coming up into her room a couple of times, but what finally woke her up at only a few minutes short of midnight was an insistent tapping above her head, coming from her skylight. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Marinette sat up in bed immediately, her quilt flying off of her and her hair standing up in places it usually didn\u2019t. She was hoping it was just a bird or a branch scraping across her window again, but she had a very sinking feeling that she knew exactly what it was at her window. Sure enough, when she stood up on her bed and flipped open the hatch, she peeked her head outside to find Chat Noir, balancing himself on the banister of her balcony, worrying his lip between his teeth and clinking his claws against the bars of the barricade. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>She could feel the shame blooming on her face, and her fingers were clenching the edge of the window so tightly that her skin was stretching tight over her knuckles. He must have seen her hesitance because he held a hand out toward her. \u201cMarinette, please. Just a few minutes, that\u2019s all I ask \u2014 \u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be here,\u201d Marinette interrupted. She ducked back into her room and closed the hatch behind her, huddling near the head of her bed with only her small night lamp to illuminate her room. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>But Chat Noir was already pressing his face against her window and speaking through the glass, his voice coming out muffled. \u201cYou can\u2019t keep avoiding me like this,\u201d he pleaded. \u201cI\u2019ve been calling you and texting you, but you haven\u2019t been answering. You\u2019re worrying me.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d Marinette called back.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cDon\u2019t lie,\u201d Chat said pitifully. \u201cI know when you\u2019re okay, and you\u2019re not okay. I can\u2019t even pretend to understand what you\u2019re feeling but...please, let me help. I want to help.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Marinette tucked her knees to her chest and turned her face towards the wall. \u201cThis can\u2019t be fixed, Adrien,\u201d she called back. \u201cJust go home.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>He was silent for a moment, and Marinette had thought for sure he had left before he spoke so quietly she almost didn\u2019t hear him. \u201c...will you let me try?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Just from the sound of his voice, she could practically see what his face must have looked like on the other side of that window, and that was almost enough for her to just open the hatch, because that face was probably the same face he had when she yelled at him in the hallway and completely spurned him away. But she was terrified of hearing what he\u2019d say, terrified of hearing that things from here on out might have to change, terrified of even having to sit in front of him and have that conversation. She tucked her knees to her chest and covered her face with her arms and didn\u2019t answer him. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cMarinette\u2026\u201d he called out again. She heard him sigh loudly and gently tap his claws against the glass. \u201cPlease don\u2019t make me do something embarrassing so that you\u2019ll let me in\u2026\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Marinette lifted her head and sighed. \u201cLike what?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>There was more silence again, and Marinette couldn\u2019t see him or his shadow from her spot on the bed. But then his boots scraped against the floor as he cleared his throat dramatically. \u201c</span>\n<em>\n<span>Paw-lease</span>\n</em>\n<span> let me in.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>She couldn\u2019t help it. She let out a short, desperate laugh that sounded more like a sob than anything else, but it put a smile on her face. \u201cNo, no, you\u2019re not doing this to me again.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhat?\u201d he said, small bits of humor sneaking into his voice. \u201cPurr-suading myself in with my claw-some jokes?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Marinette tried to sound stern, but a smile was starting to crack. \u201cYou are not bargaining to get your way with your jokes, you always do that, and it\u2019s not working this time.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cPurr-incess,\u201d Chat Noir pleaded again. \u201cI just want to have a con-fur-sation.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAdrien, go home,\u201d she said rather unconvincingly. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cBut I just want to have a talk with my fur-end,\u201d he laughed. \u201cI\u2019m furry worried about her.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The last one was so awful that she actually crawled up to the window and glared at him, seeing his hopeful face staring at her back through the window. \u201cYou\u2019re really going to keep doing this, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI know you think my claw-ver jokes are pre-paw-sterous, but I just want to see your purr-ty smile again so that I know you\u2019re feline fine.\u201d He even had to stop to laugh at himself at that one, but he sobered up and pressed his hand to the glass. \u201cCome on, Mari,\u201d he said more seriously. \u201cIt\u2019s just me. There\u2019s nothing to be scared of. It\u2019s only me.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>She wanted to tell him that it was </span>\n<em>\n<span>because</span>\n</em>\n<span> it was him that she didn\u2019t want to let him inside in the first place. But he was staring at her so sincerely, looking inside like he was genuinely worried she was hurt or alone or in need of some support. There really wasn\u2019t any way she could say not to him, was there? Because if it was him, she\u2019d be at his window begging to be let in and wouldn\u2019t take no for an answer either.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>So against her better judgement, and despite how much it made her hands tremble, she opened up the hatch again and watched as Chat Noir detransformed into Adrien so that his socks touched down onto her sheets instead of his boots. She backed up against her pillows and tucked her feet underneath her while she watched him cross his legs at the foot of her bed, click his tongue against his teeth, and look down at his hands sitting in his lap. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Marinette was nibbling on her thumb nail and spoke first. \u201cSo...you wanted to talk.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Adrien nodded and tapped his hands against his knees. \u201cRight, so uh\u2026\u201d He reached into the pocket of his sweatpants and pulled out his phone. \u201cI actually wanted to show you something first if that\u2019s okay.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Marinette snorted. \u201cWhat, is Chloe making fun of me on Facebook or something? Because that\u2019s the last thing I want to see right now.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNo, nothing like that,\u201d Adrien promised, swiping and tapping through his phone before sighing and handing it over to her. \u201cJust...keep swiping through.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cSwiping through what?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Adrien winced and rubbed the back of his neck. \u201cWell...I mean, you\u2019ll see.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Marinette raised a brow at him, but decided that if she already let him inside, she might as well play along with whatever it is he wanted to show her. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Of course the last thing she expected to see was a picture of what looked like all of Adrien\u2019s computer monitors and their screensavers which were all plastered with more pictures of Ladybug than Marinette knew even existed. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Her mouth formed into an \u2018o\u2019 as she kept swiping through the pictures. Screenshots of his subscription to the Ladyblog, his admin profile for the message boards, all of the Ladybug merchandise that he must have gotten off of the dozens of websites that started branding the heroes the moment they showed up on the scene, and all the bookmarks on his browser of videos of her solo patrols that Alya had managed to get while biking through the city late at night for exclusive sightings of the heroes. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>She swiped through the photos three times over before she looked up at him. \u201cW-What is this?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Adrien chuckled nervously. \u201cWell, uh...that\u2019s um...that\u2019s, that\u2019s all my stuff. Um. Yeeeah. I figured you might want to see it.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Marinette was shaking her head and handing his phone back. \u201cWait, I\u2019m so confused, why are you showing me all this? Why do you have all this stuff?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAre you sitting down?\u201d he asked hesitantly. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAdrien\u2026\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOkay, okay, okay, sorry, it\u2019s just\u2026.\u201d he sighed out. \u201cThis is kind of a lot, so I\u2019m just gonna say it, and you can react however you want, alright?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Marinette shrugged. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Adrien took a moment to brace both of his hands on the back of his neck and valiantly force his gaze up so that he was looking straight into her eyes as he spoke. \u201cI...I really liked Ladybug.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWell, yeah, that I knew,\u201d Marinette responded. \u201cYou flirted with me every chance you got, it was hard not to notice. But we were just joking around about it.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNo, no, you don\u2019t get it, it was...well it was way more than that,\u201d Adrien said quietly. He swallowed another gulp of air as if he were trying to collect whatever spare courage he had left. \u201cI didn\u2019t just like you. I was...I was completely in love you.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>He shut his eyes tightly and dropped his head when the words came out as if he were expecting a blow in response. But Marinette couldn\u2019t find the words to say anything in response because the words hadn\u2019t finished processing for her yet \u2014 like they had just floated through her brain without picking up any meanings or giving her any hints for how to answer him, or ever for how she was supposed to feel. Her heart was beating in her ears and she tried to remember if she\u2019d seen any signs of it in the midst of his flirting. But everything had just seemed like a joke, something silly that Chat Noir did because Chat Noir loved fooling around and saying embarrassing things to annoy her. He didn\u2019t seem like the type that would hold anything in or tone anything down in front of her \u2014 that was always his style, to say exactly what he was thinking regardless of what anyone thought. All this time, he\u2019d been keeping that secret locked up tight. Just like she had. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>That meant that this entire time...both of them...without either of them even realizing it\u2026</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>She didn\u2019t think things could possibly get more confusing for them, yet here they were sitting with these two big secrets that should\u2019ve made everything far more simpler yet only managed to leave the two of them unable to fill the space between them. This wasn\u2019t what she\u2019d planned for when she\u2019d let him inside. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>There was a long stretch of silence between them that left Adrien agitated and fidgeting. \u201cOh, please say something\u2026\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>She pulled her hair away from her eyes and tried to think of something to ask him. \u201cFor how long?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Adrien raised both his brows. \u201cHonestly? The first day I met you. I know you seemed nervous and were just getting used to things during our first fight, but...you really amazed me in the end. I just thought that I wanted to be half the hero that this girl was. That no matter what, no matter who was underneath that mask, I was going to love that girl irrevocably.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Since the first day. Just like her. It only took that one moment in the rain in front of their school and she knew that Adrien was perfect. Lovely, handsome, just a touch self-conscious, but willing to put his neck out to right wrongs with a girl he\u2019d only just met himself. That spoke volumes for her, and she knew at that moment that it didn\u2019t matter what this boy did, she would love him and adore him no matter what. While all those feelings were true and strong when she\u2019d felt them, she also couldn\u2019t deny that it was a lot of perfection to hold a person up to, and she\u2019d long come to terms with that, long discovered that there was no way to possibly love so much of a person without knowing them well. Yet here was Adrien, coming to her and telling her that he\u2019d done something almost similar, except his heart was completely enamoured with Ladybug and everything she stood for. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<span>Was</span>\n</em>\n<span>. Past tense. He\u2019d said it multiple times. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhy are you telling me all this?\u201d she asked hopelessly. \u201cIs it not true anymore? Was it because of today?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNo!\u201d Adrien said hurriedly. \u201cNo, no! I mean...I don\u2019t think I can say I\u2019m in love with Ladybug anymore, at least not in the way I was before. But that isn\u2019t because of today! At least, not really.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou\u2019re not making sense\u2026\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Adrien huffed. \u201cThat\u2019s because I\u2019m doing a terrible job of explaining this.\u201d He slapped his cheeks a couple of times and wiped his hands down his face. \u201cAlright. Do over. Something you said to me in the hallway on Friday really stuck. Stuck with me throughout the entire day of school and even when I went home that day. It was when you said that...that you put me on a pedestal, and you said that was unfair to me. And that you took all of those\u2026.those photos of me down, because you said it was different now. Which made a lot of sense to me, and that\u2019s when I realized...I don\u2019t love you like that anymore either. Because I was unfair to you too.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Marinette furrowed her brows at him. \u201cWhat are you saying?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI\u2019m saying,\u201d Adrien answered carefully. \u201cThat even though I always said that no matter what I\u2019d love the girl behind that mask...you made me realize that maybe that wasn\u2019t fair to you. It was a lot of expectations to hold a person up to, like you said. And now that I know Ladybug is you, I think that especially because...well, at the end of the day I didn\u2019t know you that well. I proclaimed all of this undying love and ridiculous standards to a girl that I never really got the chance to know. And how can I say such lofty things about a girl I haven\u2019t even given a proper chance to yet?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Adrien scooted closer to Marinette on the bed, only a couple of inches, but it felt like a lot for her who was rooted in place by the speech he was giving. \u201cThe minute I found out it was you, I wanted to get to know you better. I wanted to get used to the fact that Ladybug is also a little clumsy, lives in a bakery, can\u2019t get up on time for school to save her life, and dreams of being a designer one day. The love wasn\u2019t there anymore because...well, you weren\u2019t just Ladybug anymore. I had to start over clean and fresh, which was fun and amazing...and I\u2019ve really loved getting to start over fresh with you and getting to know you better,\u201d he smiled, and good grief if that didn\u2019t make her heart want to burst right out of her chest. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI\u2019ve done embarrassing things too,\u201d he finally said. \u201cI had pictures everywhere, I spent </span>\n<em>\n<span>way</span>\n</em>\n<span> too much time on the Ladyblog, and I needed to grab and hang onto every piece of you I could. But you were right. You can\u2019t worship people like that. No person is perfect enough for that kind of thing, but that\u2019s a good thing, I guess! Makes us human.\u201d He took in a huge breath. \u201cAll that to say I snapped all of those pictures and took down all of that Ladybug stuff down about a month ago.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Marinette shook her head in disbelief and leaned forward. \u201cWait a minute, what do you mean you took that stuff down? All of it?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYup!\u201d Adrien grinned nervously. \u201cChanged my screensavers. I unsubscribed to the Ladyblog, and to be honest I don\u2019t really check it anymore, not like how I used to anyway. I\u2019m not on the boards anymore ranting on about you.\u201d He winced. \u201cAdmittedly, I kept all of my Ladybug t-shirts mainly because they\u2019re comfortable, but that\u2019s it! Everything else, just\u2026\u201d he shrugged helplessly. \u201cIt just didn\u2019t feel right having.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>She laughed a little breathlessly, more out of relief than out of finding anything humorous about his story. Or maybe it was funny in an ironic kind of way because for all of her agonizing these past couple of days, they\u2019d been in the same boat this entire time: humanizing each other and trying to distance themselves from their old habits of taking little ideas and little bits of people and blowing them into perceptions bigger than either of them could comfortably handle. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>She nodded in understanding. \u201cI get it. You came here to even us out.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Adrien smiled crookedly and reached out to link his pinkie with hers. She curled her finger around his and immediately felt at ease. \u201cI guess you could look at it that way, but I wasn\u2019t trying to do it to make fun of both of us. I just wanted you to understand me a little but better. Because I don\u2019t see anything that Chloe said as some horrible secret that\u2019s ruined me in your eyes.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI mean that I\u2019m not ashamed of my embarrassing crush. I\u2019m not telling you how </span>\n<em>\n<span>you</span>\n</em>\n<span> should feel about what Chloe said, but I don\u2019t see anything that she said about you as shameful or strange or anything like that. It\u2019s just more parts of who we are. And maybe they\u2019re hard to look at, but I don\u2019t think we should ignore them. So what? You had a crush on Adrien, and I had a crush on Ladybug. That\u2019s all different now. All we\u2019re trying to do now is just complete each other until we can finally have a good proper opinion of each other, right?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Marinette took his whole hand into hers and squeezed tightly. \u201cRight,\u201d she said with assurance. Because it hadn\u2019t ever occurred to her to treat her crush on him like anything else other than some dirty secret that needed to be kept under wraps for anything to work out. But maybe he was right. Nothing about their feelings for each other had to be shameful. It wasn\u2019t as if they were coming from places of malice. It was like a process. A series of steps that were going to keep changing and keep looking different the more they found out. They\u2019d keep going until they could finally stare at completed versions of each other. </span>\n<b>\u00a0</b>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cSo,\u201d she sighed. \u201cWhat happens when we finally form our final opinions, as you say? What are we then?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Adrien looked down at their hands. \u201cI guess we\u2019ll just have to wait and see.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Friends. Partners. Crushes. Something more. She supposed there really was no way to tell at this point. She thought she was starting to get a better sense of what she </span>\n<em>\n<span>wanted</span>\n</em>\n<span>, and maybe that was a good start. But Adrien was right. There was still time for that, and Marinette rather liked the fact that the fun was in finding that out little by little. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>He wasn\u2019t angry with her. He wasn\u2019t disgusted with her. They were both in the same boat, traipsing along on this confusing adventure together, tripping up and stumbling about because nothing was ever perfect, and people were hard things to figure out all in one go. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>And just like that, she felt so much better. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Marinette finally finished closing the distance between them until their knees were touching and their hands were resting on their crossed legs. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she said. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to yell at you. I was really overwhelmed by everything and I didn\u2019t know how to face you. I thought you\u2019d be creeped out and you wouldn\u2019t want to see me again. I couldn\u2019t stomach that from you of all people, so I just ran.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Adrien put his other hand on her shoulder and brushed his thumb on her collarbone. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to apologize. I understand. But just know that I\u2019d never think anything that terrible about you. And I know it\u2019s only been a couple of days but...I missed you. I missed talking to you, and I just wanted to make sure you were okay.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>She felt herself grinning so hard that her cheeks hurt, and it was at times like this where Adrien seemed so simple to her \u2014 just someone who cared about her and always, no matter what, wanted to make sure she was happy. She didn\u2019t know why she was ever intimidated by him or how she ever assumed he would think poorly of her over something like this. Marinette moved forward and wrapped her arms around his neck, pressing her cheek into his shoulder and letting her nose brush up against the crook of his neck. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry,\u201d she muttered into his skin. \u201cI\u2019m really, really sorry. I didn\u2019t mean to worry you.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>His arms came winding around her back. \u201cI\u2019m just glad you\u2019re alright, my Lady. You know that\u2019s all I ever want.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Sitting there in his arms in the dim lighting of her room, with no one around, with her parents sound asleep downstairs, feeling his breathing through the rises and falls of his chest, she had this strong desire to pull away from him and kiss him. There was so much mounting affection and relief inside of her, hugging him didn\u2019t feel like enough. Marinette wasn\u2019t sure how he\u2019d react or if they were even ready for that sort of thing, but she found she rather didn\u2019t care. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>So she leaned back in his arms until they were face to face, their arms hanging loosely around each other. His lips were right there, she could go ahead and do it quickly and wait for the fallout later. All of his encouragement had fueled her up with a strange brand of courage that she figured could power her through the whole thing, despite his reaction. He was looking at her like he was in a pleasant daze, with his mouth open just a bit and his eyes lidded, and it seemed perfect. Right there. Two seconds. She barely even needed to move her head. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>But, she chickened out. Instead, she leaned forward and placed a long, gentle kiss right on the apple of his cheek. She smiled through the kiss when she felt how warm his skin was, and pulled away to see him smiling madly. That enough was worth it. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>She puffed her cheeks out. \u201cSchool is still going to be really uncomfortable\u2026\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Adrien didn\u2019t look convinced. \u201cPeople aren\u2019t as cruel as you think, especially since I think everyone is of the universal opinion that Chloe was way out of line. I think school will be okay.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou sure?\u201d she snorted. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAlmost positive,\u201d he assured. \u201cAnd even if it isn\u2019t, I\u2019ll be with you every step of the way.\u201d He drew an \u2018x\u2019 on his chest. \u201cCross my heart.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>It was a small gesture, but a powerful one. \u201cThanks,\u201d Marinette told him. \u201cHonestly, thank you.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou know I\u2019d do anything for you, Mari.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Yes, she did, and she was forever grateful that she had him. It felt almost silly now to think that he\u2019d ever turn her away or refuse to speak to her again, especially with sitting here with him like this felt so natural. She didn\u2019t want him to leave just yet, and she spoke rather impulsively. \u201cS-So, uh, I know it\u2019s late,\u201d Marinette offered. \u201cBut I\u2019ve been cooped up all weekend. Wanna go out for a bit of a run? We can race to the Seine and skip rocks again. Is that okay?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Adrien\u2019s hand came up to cup the cheek that she\u2019d kissed and nodded. \u201cY-Yeah,\u201d he agreed softly. \u201cGoing out sounds great.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhat did I tell you? Our Instagram is blowing up! A hundred thousand likes and counting. Just from one selfie. Oh man, we should totally film ourselves! Exclusive Ladybug and Chat Noir footage? We\u2019ll get so many followers.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThis coming from the person who says that maintaining his Adrien Agreste Instagram is </span>\n<em>\n<span>soulless</span>\n</em>\n<span> and </span>\n<em>\n<span>exhausting</span>\n</em>\n<span>.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Adrien snorted. \u201cThat\u2019s because it </span>\n<em>\n<span>is</span>\n</em>\n<span> soulless and exhausting.\u201d He lifted his hands and started air quoting. \u201cIn makeup, getting ready for my shoot! Hashtag: that modelling life. Hashtag: makeup. Hashtag: fashion. Hashtag: style. Hashtag: die. Hashtag: kill me. Hashtag: get me out of here.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThat\u2019s not very nice to the few hundred thousand followers you have that probably read all of your tags and relish those days when you\u2019re getting your contour done.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOf which you are one of them, you hypocrite!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cUm, your father is a fashion genius. You bet your modelling butt I\u2019m gonna follow you and see what kinds of shoots he\u2019s putting you into.\u201d Marinette grabbed his phone from his hand and switched screens to Adrien\u2019s personal account. \u201cBesides, I find your food posts way more interesting.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>He frowned and stared over her shoulder. \u201cYou find my kale salads interesting?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Marinette jogged in front of him while walking backwards and started dramatically reading through the tags of one of his posts. \u201cFirst meal of the day! Hashtag: food Hashtag: health. Hashtag: feeling good. Hashtag: lies, lies lies!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Adrien rolled his eyes. \u201cMy father and my publicist practically run that thing for me, give me a break.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIf only your precious followers knew that just last night you literally inhaled an entire box of fudge by yourself. Talk about \u201chealth\u201d and \u201cfeeling good,\u201d you glutton.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou said I could have it!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Marinette smirked. \u201cI said you could have </span>\n<em>\n<span>some</span>\n</em>\n<span> of it. You took that as an invitation to stuff your face.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Adrien sighed and slung an arm around her shoulder. \u201cYou know, when we said we\u2019d walk to school together, it wasn\u2019t so that you could fat shame me.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Marinette looked up at him and pouted her lips. \u201cBut you make it so easy.\u201d Adrien frowned playfully and tugged out one of her pigtails before messing up her hair and making her scream in horror. She blew the hair out of her face and chased after Adrien who was already running up the stairs to their school building and sprinting across the courtyard before she caught up with him. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>They\u2019d pretty much spent the entire weekend together, and only having to focus on Adrien and his company had done wonders for distracting her about what happened last week. They\u2019d stayed out most of Saturday night having races up the Eiffel Tower and skipping rocks on the river, and on Sunday Adrien had decided to come to her bakery and buy a literal armful of treats for them to take to the park while they talked and blasted through all of the homework that Marinette had been neglecting all weekend. Ever since she found out his identity, Adrien\u2019s personality became explosive when he was only with her, and it filled up the space so much that Marinette only ever needed to focus her attention on him and the two of them in the moment. It made her forget about the dread she was meant to be feeling about having to face her entire classroom on Monday after having all of her embarrassing secrets spread out in the open. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>But now that they\u2019d left the locker room and were heading to their first class, Marinette was starting to feel all that apprehension mount up inside of her. She froze a few feet away from the entrance of the classroom and felt Adrien\u2019s chest collide with her back. He gripped her elbow and shook her arm. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Marinette winced and balanced on her toes. \u201cI just\u2026\u201d She whined and turned to face Adrien. \u201cThey all know. And they\u2019re just gonna see me walk in, and I\u2019m gonna know that they know.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI thought you said you\u2019d gotten over it,\u201d he said worriedly. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI did with you!\u201d she clarified. \u201cBut this is still just generally embarrassing and I don\u2019t want to sit through class with people snickering behind their books. And </span>\n<em>\n<span>Chloe</span>\n</em>\n<span> is just going to take full advantage and make everything ten times worse and school is going to become a literal hell hole and I don\u2019t want to willingly subject myself to that endless nightmare.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>He laughed and placed his hands on his shoulders. \u201cHas anyone ever told you that you tend to overthink things?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Marinette darted her eyes to the side. \u201c...I may have been briefly notified of the habit.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAlright,\u201d Adrien decided, rubbing his fingers into her shoulders which Marinette found wonderfully comforting. \u201cWell, let\u2019s start with ignoring Chloe. You do that all the time anyway, and she can only make you feel bad if you think her opinion matters. Which I doubt you do.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Marinette snorted but nodded her head. \u201cAlright, easy enough.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cGood,\u201d he grinned. \u201cAnd I know you\u2019re going to just have to trust me on this, but I really don\u2019t think everyone is going to be as cruel as you say. Everyone jumped to criticize Chloe after you stormed out and no one said a word against you, I swear.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t change the fact that it\u2019s still humiliating,\u201d Marinette grumbled. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhy is it humiliating when they\u2019re concerned, and not when I am?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cBecause they don\u2019t know our business,\u201d Marinette said. \u201cThey\u2019re still just going to see it as silly little Marinette who had a big creepy crush on the handsome boy in class without said handsome boy even knowing about it. There\u2019s no coming back from that.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Adrien paused thoughtfully and grinned widely. \u201cHandsome, huh?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Marinette pinched him in the arm and tried to hold back her laughter. \u201cHush and focus\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAlright, alright, fine,\u201d he relented. He hummed in thought. \u201cWell, then I guess the only solution is for them to get the whole story so that they can\u2019t hold any judgement.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Marinette raised a brow. \u201cI can think of several problems with that plan. A few of them including the fact that we both share a very interesting hobby.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWell, okay, I don\u2019t mean tell them </span>\n<em>\n<span>everything</span>\n</em>\n<span> everything,\u201d Adrien clarified. \u201cBut the whole thing looks a lot less weird when you consider that I kinda had a really huge, ridiculous crush on you, and the two of us can just laugh about it.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cBecause we\u2019re both dorky and ridiculous.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cExactly! They cancel each other out.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>She crossed her arms over her chest. \u201cSo how do you suppose we fill everyone in?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Adrien took a long moment to stroke his chin and pretend to ponder over the question with intense concentration. Marinette decided to humor him and lean against the wall to wait for him to come up with an answer. He spun around in a circle a couple of times and paced the length of the hallway before he nodded and clasped his hands behind his back. \u201cWell, Ms. Dupain-Cheng. I believe there is a very simple two-phase plan that could rectify this.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAnd what would that be?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>He waggled his eyebrows. \u201cDoes that mean you consent to Phase one?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAm I going to regret it?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI have it on good authority that it\u2019s an </span>\n<em>\n<span>excellent</span>\n</em>\n<span> plan.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOn whose authority?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cChat Noir\u2019s of course. Have you met him? Handsome fellow. Amazing body. Rapier wit. Not bad with the ladies, either. I mean, between you and me? Goals.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cReally,\u201d Marinette joked. \u201cI hear he\u2019s a bit of a loser.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cBlasphemy, my Lady! Slander! What if someone heard you?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAnd you call me dramatic,\u201d Marinette chuckled. \u201cAlright, I\u2019ll bite. What\u2019s Phase one of your plan?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Adrien sighed and placed both of his hands against his heart. \u201cAh, I\u2019m so glad you asked Marinette. You\u2019re about to find out.\u201d He grabbed her shoulders, spun her around, and started to march her straight into the classroom. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Marinette blinked and looked over her shoulder at Adrien in shock as they crossed the threshold. \u201cW-Wait a minute! What are you doing?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Adrien smirked. \u201cThis.\u201d He wrapped both of his arms around Marinette\u2019s shoulders and just as the rest of the class watched them enter, he leaned down and started placing huge, sloppy kisses on both of her cheeks and on the top of her head while he walked them in the direction of their seats. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>She squealed at the contact and immediately bunched her shoulders up to her ears to stop his progress. \u201cWhat are you </span>\n<em>\n<span>doing!?</span>\n</em>\n<span> Stop!!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhy?\u201d Adrien frowned before he grinned wickedly and placed a kiss right on the tip of her nose. \u201cI\u2019m just showing everyone how </span>\n<em>\n<span>amazing</span>\n</em>\n<span> and </span>\n<em>\n<span>wonderful</span>\n</em>\n<span> and </span>\n<em>\n<span>incredible</span>\n</em>\n<span> you are, because you are most certainly all of those things and more.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Marinette grabbed at his wrists and tried to duck around his kisses while she tried to maneuver them across the front of the classroom as she tried to speak through all of her laughter. \u201cAgh! Stop it! You\u2019re going to make me trip.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cDon\u2019t trip!\u201d Adrien laughed breathlessly. \u201cYou\u2019re going to take us both with you!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThen get off of me!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNever!\u201d he cried out. He leaned down and put all of his bodyweight on Marinette\u2019s shoulders and smirked when she let out a grunt and doubled over under his weight. She grumbled under her breath as she tightened her hold on his wrists and started to slowly drag slash march them up the stairs and to their seats. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Marinette was struggling to lift her legs high enough to get up the steps and managed to catch Myl</span>\n<span>\u00e8ne\u2019s eye. She was giggling at the display and lifted her hand in a friendly wave. \u201cHey, you two.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Marinette huffed and was relieved to get a warm, normal welcome. \u201cHi </span>\n<span>Myl</span>\n<span>\u00e8ne.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Adrien shifted so that his chin was leaning on Marinette\u2019s shoulder and smiled at this classmate. \u201cGood morning, </span>\n<span>Myl</span>\n<span>\u00e8ne. Wonderful day today, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou two are so freakin\u2019 bizarre,\u201d Alix snorted from her seat. \u201cWhat are you even doing?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIsn\u2019t it obvious?\u201d Kim laughed, leaning into the aisle. \u201cMarinette is giving piggyback rides to everyone\u2019s seats. I call next!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>She pointed menacingly at him. \u201cDon\u2019t you dare!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Adrien gasped. \u201cWait! That\u2019s such a good idea. Quick, grab my legs, I\u2019m gonna jump on your back.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNo! You\u2019re gonna crush me!\u201d Marinette cried out when she felt him jumping up. She looked over her shoulder. \u201cGo to your seat, you oversized child.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cBut we were having fun!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cClass is about to start, and I don\u2019t want to throw my back out because of you.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Adrien frowned thoughtfully. \u201cInteresting argument. So does that mean we\u2019ll revisit this after class ends?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Marinette rolled her eyes at his antics. \u201cYeah. Sure.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI\u2019ll hold you to that,\u201d he teased and unwrapped his arms from around her. He quickly smoothed out the hair on the top of her head that he\u2019d accidentally messed up in all the excitement and patted her on the head before he slid into his own seat. Marinette was trying to look annoyed at him, but she just smiled all the way back to her seat and tried to ignore the look of complete incredulity that Nino and Alya were sending to both of them. Marinette said hi to Nathanael and Max who greeted her warmly as they headed to their seats and was glad that at least everyone else wasn\u2019t scrutinizing her or talking about her behind her back. Adrien was right after all. It was nice to know she\u2019d been worrying over nothing. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Alya leaned her elbow on the table and turned her body completely to face Marinette. She could vaguely see Nino and Adrien hunched over in a conversation in front of her, but Marinette decided to calmly fold her hands on her desk, clear her throat, and pretend that nothing was wrong. \u201cMorning, Alya.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Alya kept staring for a few more seconds before she shook her head. \u201cOkay girl, I love you, but you\u2019re giving me whiplash over here.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhat?\u201d Marinette shrugged. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cUm, you jetted out of here on Friday, were inconsolable Saturday, and now Adrien is hanging off of you like a puppy on Monday?\u201d Alya took her glasses off and rubbed at the bridge of her nose. \u201cOooooh, geez, you\u2019re gonna give me a migraine.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIt\u2019s nothing,\u201d Marinette insisted. \u201cWe...talked. And it\u2019s fine now. I...may have overreacted that day.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou seemed to think it was the end of the world this weekend,\u201d Alya prodded. \u201cBut you guys </span>\n<em>\n<span>talked</span>\n</em>\n<span>\u201d \u2014 she paused to give the appropriately dramatic air quotes \u2014 \u201cand now you\u2019re getting cheek kisses and acting all nauseatingly sweet.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Marinette tucked a strand of hair behind her ear and started to pull out her books and her tablet. \u201cAdrien was being silly. He\u2019s like that.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOh </span>\n<em>\n<span>is</span>\n</em>\n<span> he?\u201d Alya grinned. \u201cDo tell me more.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Marinette slapped Alya\u2019s wrist. \u201cShush! He\u2019s right there!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cPlease, I\u2019m sure Nino is giving him a similar interrogation at the moment since the two of you are being awfully familiar for two people who </span>\n<em>\n<span>aren\u2019t dating.\u201d</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Marinette lowered her voice to a whisper. \u201cWe aren\u2019t dating.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Alya smirked. \u201cHm. And why is that?\u201d she whispered back. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Marinette blinked and struggled for a response.\u201d B-Because...because, I-I told you already. I don\u2019t want to ruin our friendship. We\u2019re just friends.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOh, you\u2019re </span>\n<em>\n<span>just</span>\n</em>\n<span> friends,\u201d Alya mocked. \u201c</span>\n<em>\n<span>Just</span>\n</em>\n<span> friends don\u2019t barrel into class covering each other in kisses and hanging off of each other during study hall and being all clingy and affectionate at every available opportunity.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Marinette sighed. \u201cWe\u2019re not clingy and affectionate.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Her attention was sidetracked just as Chloe picked that exact moment to barge into the classroom and bang the door against the back wall. Her eyes immediately drifted up to Marinette and she looked ready to spout something hateful at her. Adrien must have noticed because before Chloe could even open her mouth, Adrien turned around, kneeled on his chair, and grabbed both of Marinette\u2019s hands in his own. \u201cMarinette, I didn\u2019t get to ask. Do you want to have lunch together today? If you don\u2019t have any other plans, that is.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Chloe\u2019s eyes widened dangerously behind him, and Marinette chuckled at the sight. \u201cSure,\u201d she told him, unable to help her own smile as he beamed at her, looking genuinely satisfied. \u201cI don\u2019t have anything planned during break.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAh, perfect. We can invite Nino and Alya too. It\u2019ll be fun.\u201d He kissed her knuckles and twisted back around to sit in his seat. Chloe, on the other hand, was standing in the front of the classroom looking absolutely gobsmacked. She was clutching her phone so tightly Marinette could swear she could hear cracking sounds all the way from her seat. Her entire face screwed up in annoyance, but Chloe merely stomped one of her feet, walked over to her desk and threw her bag on the floor, Sabrina following meekly behind her trying to dodge any backlash. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Alya laughed at the scene and turned back to Marinette with a knowing look. \u201cYeah. Adrien didn\u2019t just ward off Chloe by being totally clingy and affectionate.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Marinette didn\u2019t really have any defense for that, so she huffed and turned back to the front of the classroom, thankful that their teacher had decided at that moment to come in and let Marinette off the hook. \u201cThat\u2019s just...how we are. It\u2019s normal. We\u2019re fine.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cDon\u2019t try and pull the wool over my eyes,\u201d Alya snorted. \u201cYou two are beating around the bush at this point. I mean seriously, no boy acts that way towards a girl if he isn\u2019t totally into her. What the hell you two are waiting for is beyond me.\u201d Marinette desperately wanted to respond, but their teacher was already putting notes on the board and she was forced to shelf the conversation and focus on her work. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The wash of relief that Adrien\u2019s visit on Saturday had given her did wonders in terms of abating her anxieties about whether or not he thought badly about her because of her previous feelings. But once all that faded away, it left one very large, very obvious, and franky very conflicting elephant in the room for Marinette to ponder over: did Adrien like her? Her as Marinette </span>\n<em>\n<span>and</span>\n</em>\n<span> Ladybug. Her as this new hybrid version of the girl he thought he knew so well before. Her as the person he came running to this weekend to make sure that she was alright and to make sure that she understood in explicit terms that he didn\u2019t think any less of her.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Her part of the equation was already figured out \u2014 she liked him a lot, longed for his company and his affection in a way that made her restless and agitated with feelings she so desperately wished were reciprocated. But she didn\u2019t want to nail the coffin of their friendship closed and make things awkward between them by confessing unless she was at least more than fifty percent sure that Adrien felt the same way. And that was the rub of it all \u2014 she had no darn clue how he felt. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Adrien said so many things to her this weekend that made her want to think that he did feel the same way. He missed her. He wanted to know she was alright. He\u2019d do anything for her. He still wanted to keep learning more about her and spend more time with her until he knew her completely. It could\u2019ve very well been the words of a concerned friend, but it was far easier to place all of those words into feelings that were just a little more intense. And she thought about all those times when he leaned his head in her lap or hugged her from behind or covered her in an embarrassing amount of kisses in front of the whole class. That had to have meant something. Surely, there was something brewing between them that was starting to feel less like friendship and more like something stronger. Marinette refused to believe that it was her romantic imaginings creating connections that weren\u2019t there. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>She stared at the back of his head all throughout class, and felt a pressure deep in the back of her throat, like the admission was practically begging to come out at any second, regardless of Marinette\u2019s reservations. She started to wonder if maybe Alya was right. Maybe her feelings weren\u2019t destructive. Maybe there would be no irrevocable damage if she just cut her losses and told him the truth. Perhaps there was something to be said about holding in such strong feelings and giving them nowhere to go. Alya very clearly thought that Marinette should say something, and perhaps it was time to buck up the courage and just do it. She\u2019d been spending all this time worrying about how Adrien would feel afterwards when maybe she needed to start thinking about herself.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Besides, Adrien hardly batted a lash at the mention of her crush when it was mortifyingly off base. Surely a confession like this would most certainly get an even warmer reaction...right? </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Was it really as bad as she was making it seem in her head?</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Morning classes rolled along while Marinette changed her mind no less than eight times about whether to tell Adrien her feelings, and by the time lunch arrived, she still wasn\u2019t completely at ease with either option. She hoped that lunch would do the job of distracting her.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cCan we go somewhere that isn\u2019t my bakery today?\u201d Marinette suggested. She pointed a finger into Adrien\u2019s stomach. \u201cThis one has had enough sweets from there to last him through the winter.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWas that another muted fat joke?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHey, it\u2019s your model diet that you\u2019re ruining. That okay with you two?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Alya shrugged. \u201cI\u2019m good with whatever. I\u2019m starving.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Nino scowled. \u201cYeah, because you spend so much time updating your blog in the mornings that you forget to eat breakfast. Which is insane, and we need to have an intervention about it.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOh leave me alone, you\u2019re the one who empties out half a vending machine and calls it a meal. How about we go to a sit down place and get you an actual course meal for once? That cool with everyone else?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Adrien had his arms wrapped around Marinette\u2019s shoulders again, and she unconsciously brought a hand up to grip at his forearm. \u201cThat\u2019s fine with me,\u201d he said with his chin leaning on her shoulder. \u201cMari?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYup,\u201d she shrugged, idly checking her phone for the time. \u201cSomeone can pick where, I don\u2019t mind.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Nino shook his head at the two of them and braced his hands on the back of his neck. \u201cMan, I don\u2019t get you two. You\u2019re like monkeys hanging off of each other. It\u2019s the most hilarious thing.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Marinette stopped in the middle of the courtyard and turned her head towards Adrien. \u201cOh, speaking of which. What was Phase two of your plan?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Adrien blinked. \u201cHm?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou know, you said you had a two phase plan to make sure the rest of the class wouldn\u2019t treat me weird about what happened on Friday. You acting like a darn fool and dragging me down with you was Phase one, so what was Phase two?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>His mouth formed into a perfect \u2018o\u2019 as he averted his gaze. \u201cRiiiiiiight.\u201d He shut his eyes tightly. \u201cYeah, I was kinda hoping you forgot about that.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Marinette knocked her head gently against his. \u201cWhy? You were super excited about it before. Now you have me curious.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Nino laughed loudly and walked over to clap Adrien on his back. \u201cYeah man, now you have </span>\n<em>\n<span>me</span>\n</em>\n<span> curious too.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Adrien whirled on him. \u201cShut up.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cDude, you might as well do it now, otherwise you\u2019re gonna chicken out and wait another ten years to try and say something.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Alya peeked over the top of her glasses. \u201cOkay, I\u2019m very intrigued by this. What is he trying to say?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNothing!\u201d Adrien said defensively. He frowned at Nino and spoke through gritted teeth. \u201cNino doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s talking about.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOkay, bro, as your best friend, it\u2019s my duty to intervene if I have reason to believe you\u2019re being an evasive dork about things that are freakin\u2019 serious. So no. You\u2019re doing the thing right here.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Adrien unwrapped himself from Marinette and was suddenly standing stiff and straight. \u201cNino,\u201d he wined. He darted his eyes to Alya and back to Nino. \u201cWith like...like with you guys watching?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWitnesses are a necessary evil, my dude.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhen you\u2019re getting married!\u201d Adrien insisted. \u201cNot when you\u2019re \u2014 \u201d He clamped his lips shut just in time before anything incriminating came out. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cListen, I don\u2019t trust that you\u2019re gonna do it if I don\u2019t watch over you like your dad. And you </span>\n<em>\n<span>have</span>\n</em>\n<span> to do it because we talked about this. So come on. I\u2019m waiting.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cStop parenting me!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cDon\u2019t talk back to your dad! Go and do your thing or you\u2019re grounded.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Marinette made a face and hesitantly raised her hand. \u201cUh, hi. Yeah. What\u2019s going on?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Nino did a little bow as if to leave the floor for Adrien and pulled Alya with him so that they were standing a couple of feet back. Alya looked like she wanted to ask more questions, but Nino just put a finger to his lips and gestured at Adrien expectantly. Adrien stared at him for a little longer before sighing and turning to face Marinette properly. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>He looked like he was holding a gigantic nervous breath in his chest that he was afraid to let out, and Marinette had to wonder what on Earth had him so tentative in front of her of all people. \u201cHey, relax,\u201d she tried to soothe. \u201cIt\u2019s just me. You can tell me anything.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Adrien puffed out his cheeks and grabbed his hair with both hands. \u201cSee, why do you have to be so understanding and comforting about it, now I really do have to say something.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cSorry?\u201d she apologized with a smirk. \u201cIf you don\u2019t want to say anything it\u2019s fine \u2014 \u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNope!\u201d Adrien said resolutely. \u201cI\u2019m gonna do this. I am so gonna do this. I\u2019m gonna do the crap out of this so hard.\u201d He winced. \u201cThat sounded wrong. Okay. Do over.\u201d He slapped his cheeks, made a pained looking face, and curled up on himself on the ground. \u201cGive me a second.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOh dude!\u201d Alya exclaimed in exasperation. \u201cOut with it already!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Marinette frowned at their two spectators and waved her hand at them. \u201cGuys. He cracks under social pressure. You\u2019re making him nervous. Move it back.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cMove it back?\u201d Alya asked. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Marinette pointed across the courtyard. \u201cTwenty feet. Go on.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThen we can\u2019t hear anything!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cGood,\u201d Marinette frowned. \u201cGo go go, before he totally loses his cool.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Alya groaned and pulled Nino back across the courtyard so that they were only just out of earshot. They were leaning against the wall and staring at the scene with rapt attention, but at least Adrien looked more calm. He looked up at her from his crouched position on the floor and sighed. \u201cYou\u2019re gonna have to bear with me, alright? I thought I\u2019d have time to rehearse this, but I guess I\u2019m just gonna have to come out with it.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Marinette clasped her hands in front of her. \u201cOkay. I\u2019m all ears.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Adrien stood on his feet and shook out his hands. \u201cAlright.\u201d He eyed his friends in the corner and made sure to lower his voice a touch to make extra sure that they wouldn\u2019t be able to hear him. \u201cI know it feels like we found out about each other a long time ago, but...that\u2019s still one of the scarier moments of my life. Because...well, because we knew how dangerous it would be if we found out, and all this means that our jobs are more complicated and that we have to be ten times more careful than we have been...but it was also amazing because I am so glad to have met you as a whole person. Finding out you were Ladybug...it feels like it\u2019s exaggerating to say it was one of the best moments of my life, but that\u2019s what it feels like.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAdrien\u2026\u201d she breathed out. She didn\u2019t know where he was going with this, but it seemed so important that she hear him out completely. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>He gulped and put his hands in his pockets. \u201cI just love hanging out with you Marinette. You\u2019re really\u2026so amazing. And getting to know you over these past few days has been some of the best fun I\u2019ve ever had. I know that the two of us had a lot of preconceptions about each other and we were fixating on just small parts of ourselves, but I like to think that I really know the real you a little better now. And I just absolutely love what I\u2019m seeing in front of me right now. It makes me happier than you could even know.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Marinette felt her nerves tingling all throughout her body, right down to her fingertips. \u201cWhat are you saying?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Adrien tapped his fingers against his thigh. \u201cI\u2019m saying\u2026\u201d He shut his eyes tightly and let out the rest of his words in a flurry. \u201cI\u2019m saying that I really like you, and would you like to grab some dinner sometime?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>He immediately covered his face with his arms and turned away from her in fear as if he were bracing himself for impact. He was trying to sneak peeks at her from between his arms to see what her reaction was, but even Marinette was having trouble properly articulating that for herself because a wall of so many feelings came crashing into her all at once. She was standing there stunned in front of him trying to think of what to say and how to react but nothing was coming out except for the constant mantra currently on repeat in her head. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>He liked her. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Adrien </span>\n<em>\n<span>liked</span>\n</em>\n<span> her. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>She liked Adrien back. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Nothing exploded. Nothing was ruined. No fallouts. No disasters. No heartbreak. No hiccups of any sort. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>He liked her and she liked him back and they both liked each other and it was mutual and why on Earth did Marinette wait so damn long to say something if this was how it was going to turn out?</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Just that thought alone frustrated her so much that she didn\u2019t even think about the fact that punching a boy in the arm after he confessed to you probably wasn\u2019t the smoothest thing she\u2019d ever done. But then again, since when was anything about the two of them ever smooth?</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOw!\u201d he yelped, immediately grabbing his arm. \u201cWhat was that for?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou\u2026\u201d she forced out. \u201cYou stupid, silly boy! I can\u2019t believe you beat me to it!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Adrien sighed. \u201cLook, I know this is a lot for me to break to you, and I get it if you don\u2019t \u2014 waaaaaaait, wait a minute, wait a minute, what? Beat you? Beat you to what?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Marinette shut her mouth, blinked, and looked at her feet. \u201cNothing\u2026\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNuh uh!\u201d he said, pointing his fingers accusingly in her face. \u201cDon\u2019t you dare! What do you mean beat you to it!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d she said back at him. \u201cI\u2019ve been agonizing all day whether to tell you that I really like you too! And I was going to have this whole speech planned out and you just go and steal my moment. Plus we literally liked each other this whole time and we so could\u2019ve gotten this out of the way so much sooner and we\u2019re so </span>\n<em>\n<span>stupid</span>\n</em>\n<span> Adrien, God.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Her outburst left Adrien leaning away from her in shock and he looked a little unequipped to answer her properly. But he sobered up after a few moments and slowly started to let one of his wolfish grins spread across his face. \u201cYou like me?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Marinette couldn\u2019t help smiling at him. How could she not smile at him, she was thrumming with so much happiness and relief she didn\u2019t know where to put it all. \u201cShut up\u2026\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou like me?\u201d he asked again. \u201cYou like </span>\n<em>\n<span>me?</span>\n</em>\n<span> You like me! Holy crap, you like me, oh my God!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>His hands were buried in his hair like his mind had just been blown. Then, out of nowhere, Adrien picked her up by the waist and proceed to spin her around amidst his excitement while he kept repeating, \u201cYou like me! Marinette likes me! She likes me, holy moley, she likes me!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWait!\u201d Nino shouted from the other side of the courtyard. \u201cDid you finally freaking tell her?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Marinette was keeping her hands on his shoulders so that she wouldn\u2019t lose her balance, but she made eye contact with Nino and nodded her head enthusiastically. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Nino\u2019s let out a holler and threw his hat in the air. \u201cThank you </span>\n<em>\n<span>God!</span>\n</em>\n<span>\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHe said it? And she said it back? Are you serious, is this crap finally over? Hot damn!\u201d Alya exclaimed. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Adrien had finally stopped spinning her, but he kept his arms around her waist so that she was still lifted in the air and pressed against his body. \u201cWait,\u201d he said breathlessly. \u201cYou mean it?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOf course,\u201d Marinette told him, holding his cheeks in both of her hands. \u201cI just...I didn\u2019t know how to tell you. I thought I was going to ruin everything.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNo,\u201d he replied with a smile. \u201cNo, nothing that you feel could ever ruin anything, it can only make it better.\u201d He was shaking his head at her in disbelief. \u201cGosh, this isn\u2019t real, I\u2019m never going to get over this.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Marinette giggled and rubbed her thumbs against his cheekbones. \u201cWell then that just means we\u2019re going to have to keep saying it until it sinks in.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Adrien bit his lip and pressed his forehead against hers. \u201cI like you.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI like you too,\u201d Marinette laughed. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI like you.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI like you.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThis is music to my ears, let\u2019s get Nino and Alya to harmonize it.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>It was such a silly joke, but Marinette laughed hard at it because she didn\u2019t think she could\u2019ve picked a more precious moment to share with him if she tried. </span>\n</p>"
