  "text": "<p>Chloe Beale has always been the pride and joy of her parents.</p>\n<p>An only child, she was well-loved and doted on.\u00a0 They\u2019d attended every one of her dance recitals, her parent teacher conferences, and sat first row when she was in a production of Hairspray in high school.</p>\n<p>They\u2019re her number one fans.</p>\n<p>So it comes as a bit of a surprise to her when one day they sit her down at dinner and tell her she needs to move out. They do it gently and with loving smiles, but still.</p>\n<p>\u201cChloe,\u201d her father says. \u201cIt\u2019s time you move on.\u201d</p>\n<p>Chloe pouts (she\u2019s totally not too old to pout) and turns to her mother. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p>\n<p>Her mom tries to smile encouragingly. \u201cHoney, you know we\u2019ve always supported you. Your father and I were happy to pay for you to attend three extra years of school to ensure you got your degree. And we\u2019ve loved that you\u2019ve been living with us for the past two years, but\u2026\u201d She trails off and her father clears his throat.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s time you do some things on your own, Chloe.\u201d He pats her hand gently, his soft blue eyes crinkling at her. She feels a lump form in her throat. She\u2019s always been a daddy\u2019s-girl.</p>\n<p>She nods bravely. She <em>is</em> twenty-seven. She really should get out of her parents\u2019 house.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re happy to help you get on your feet, sweetie,\u201d her mom says brightly.</p>\n<p>Chloe nods again, thinking about how her life has felt slightly unfulfilling since she graduated and left the Bellas. Maybe she needs a change\u2026</p>\n<p>And that\u2019s how Chloe Beale, Southern Belle(a), ends up moving to the bright and bold city of Los Angeles, California.</p>\n<p>//</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cYou\u2026 what?\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m moving to L.A.\u201d Chloe presses the phone between her cheek and shoulder as she continues to fold her clothes.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s the gentle sound of Beca breathing on the other end of the line. Chloe waits for her to process and starts stacking her clothes into her suitcase.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>You\u2019re moving\u2026 here</em>?\u201d Beca says eventually and Chloe grins outwardly. Beca really hasn\u2019t changed much.</p>\n<p>\u201cMhmmm,\u201d she hums into the phone. \u201cWhich is why I was calling you. Because I was wondering if you knew anybody who might need a roommate down there? I mean, I have enough cash to get a hotel room for a couple of days, but eventually I\u2019m going to need to \u2013 \u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>You\u2019re staying with me</em>,\u201d Beca interrupts.</p>\n<p>Chloe pauses, repressing a smile. \u201cReally? It\u2019ll just be until I find my own place, Bec, I swear.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>I have an extra room</em>,\u201d Beca says. Chloe hears her sigh. \u201c<em>I mean like. We can be roommates. Or whatever</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat would be\u2026\u201d Chloe searches for the feeling that\u2019s filling her up at the thought of living with Beca again. \u201cAca-awesome.\u201d</p>\n<p>Beca snorts. \u201c<em>That\u2019s not allowed if you move in.\u201d</em></p>\n<p>Chloe grins and zips up her suitcase. \u201cOh you love it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cNo I don\u2019t.\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t pretend, Becs. I know you do.\u201d</p>\n<p><em>\u201cI changed my mind</em>,\u201d Beca says, but Chloe can hear the amusement in her voice. \u201c<em>You can\u2019t move in.</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>Chloe rolls her eyes fondly. \u201cSee you in a few days.\u201d</p>\n<p>And that\u2019s how Chloe Beale ends up living with Beca Mitchell.</p>\n<p>//</p>\n<p>When Beca moved to L.A. two years ago, she\u2019d anticipated that it\u2019d be a long road to achieving her dreams. She\u2019d expected to have to work hard, kiss some ass, probably get some dick-wad producer lots of coffee, and eventually she\u2019d climb the ladder and make <em>music</em>.</p>\n<p>Turns out, she barely had to do that at all.</p>\n<p>Sammy sent her and Emily\u2019s demo around and when she graduated, she\u2019d received a job offer at their branch in L.A. Sammy spent a good twenty minutes lecturing Dax on the benefits of mutual interests or some shit when she told him.</p>\n<p>It\u2019d been a little slow going at first, but after just a handful of months, she\u2019d produced an EP. After a year, she had a single on the radio and a hefty amount of cash in her checking account.</p>\n<p>She bought a nice condo by the beach, one with space for a small recording studio and a guest bedroom in case someone came to visit, like Emily or Fat Amy or Jesse.</p>\n<p>He\u2019d moved here with her after graduating, but they were both busy, her with her EP and him with trying to wiggle his way into the world of cinematic scoring and Hollywood. Turns out three years together wasn\u2019t enough to withstand that, or maybe it would\u2019ve been, but they slowly began to settle into a platonic rhythm until they practically weren\u2019t even dating anymore.</p>\n<p>And then they just\u2026 weren\u2019t.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s still her best friend, but she\u2019d quickly learned that Los Angeles is a lonely place. It\u2019s full of people willing to fuck you over to get what they want, people who can\u2019t afford to trust you in case you sell them out, people who are busy at weird hours and always seem to be out of town.</p>\n<p>She\u2019s never been one to need that many friends, but after having a solid family in the Bellas for four years, it would\u2019ve been nice to have some.</p>\n<p>When Chloe called her one Tuesday afternoon, Beca kind of thought it was an emergency. Like Aubrey was in the hospital or Chloe\u2019s vocal nodes were back (could that even happen?). Sure, she\u2019d talked to Chloe a few times over the past two years, exchanging texts here and there. Chloe had FaceTimed her, screaming loudly, when she\u2019d heard Beca\u2019s song on the radio when she was driving. Chloe even called a couple of times, when she and Jesse broke up and when Chloe had gotten a job substitute teaching.</p>\n<p>So yeah, they talked sometimes, but not as often as they probably should have, and when Chloe said she was moving to L.A., it took Beca a second to process.</p>\n<p>Then Chloe was saying something about a roommate and well, Beca <em>does</em> have that extra room.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe can be roommates. Or whatever.\u201d</p>\n<p>She could practically hear Chloe\u2019s smile through the phone. <em>\u201cThat would be aca-awesome</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>Beca rolled her eyes, but couldn\u2019t help but grin.</p>\n<p>And really, that was the beginning.</p>\n<p>//</p>\n<p>Beca looks practically the same, as far as Chloe can tell. Maybe her jeans are slightly nicer and her headphones more expensive, but she answers the door with the same raised eyebrow that she used to when Chloe came knocking at her dorm her freshman year.</p>\n<p>\u201cLook who it is,\u201d Beca says with a smirk.</p>\n<p>Chloe can\u2019t help the excited scream that comes out of her mouth as she launches herself at her friend. Beca doesn\u2019t stiffen at the hug like she used to, accustomed to Chloe\u2019s tendency for physical contact. She just squeezes back with a laugh.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey Chlo.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHey Becs.\u201d Chloe pulls back, keeping the other girl within reach. \u201cLook at you!\u201d Beca just shrugs nonchalantly. \u201cAnd look at this place. Holy crap, Beca, you didn\u2019t tell me you were a millionaire.\u201d</p>\n<p>Beca rolls her eyes in perfect Beca-fashion. \u201cShut up, I\u2019m not.\u201d</p>\n<p>Chloe winks. \u201cSure.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not, I just\u2026\u201d Beca huffs at Chloe\u2019s playful face. \u201cYou know what, never mind. Just come in.\u201d</p>\n<p>Beca grabs her suitcase and drags it into the house and Chloe tries not to giggle because the suitcase is almost as big as Beca. She follows Beca onto the hardwood floor of the house, trying to take everything in about her new home.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s not too big, a good size for just Beca, and it\u2019s modern and well-decorated and warm. Chloe already feels at home.</p>\n<p>\u201cYour room is this way,\u201d Beca says, rolling Chloe\u2019s suitcase behind her. Chloe follows, head peeking into one of the rooms on the way down the hall. She smiles when she sees Beca\u2019s recording equipment set up, her laptop sitting on the desk, one of her many mixing programs open on the screen.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo yeah, this is your room,\u201d Beca says when she stops at the room next to the studio. \u201cAnd like, feel free to decorate or change it around or whatever.\u201d Beca motions to the dressers and the bed. \u201cI just got this stuff in case people visit or something.\u201d</p>\n<p>Chloe tilts her head to the side. \u201cDo you have lots of visitors?\u201d</p>\n<p>Beca shrugs. \u201cNot really. Emily comes in the summer and on her breaks sometimes and we record together. Fat Amy came once, too.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHmmm,\u201d Chloe hums, looking around the room. \u201cWell, it\u2019s nice.\u201d It is nice, if not plain. She could easily give it some flavor and it\u2019d be perfect.</p>\n<p>\u201cCool.\u201d Beca nods, crossing her arms over her chest. \u201cSo, uh. I can show you the rest of the place, or you can get settled and we can get some food or whatever you want to do.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMaybe I\u2019ll just unpack and then we could get dinner. We can catch up,\u201d Chloe says with a grin.</p>\n<p>\u201cSounds good.\u201d Beca points behind her awkwardly. Seriously, she hasn\u2019t changed at all. \u201cI\u2019m just gonna be in there working, so holler when you\u2019re ready.\u201d</p>\n<p>Beca quirks her lips in another smile before leaving her to unpack. She didn\u2019t bring much, just her entire closet and a few sentimental things like a picture of her and Aubrey freshman year and some stuff from her bedroom at home.</p>\n<p>It doesn\u2019t take her long to finish unpacking. She stores her suitcase under the bed and heads down the hall to find Beca. She pokes her head into the room she passed on the way to her bedroom and sees Beca sitting in front of her laptop, headphones on and fingers moving delicately over the track pad of her laptop.</p>\n<p>Chloe leans against the door frame for a second, watching. Beca nods her head to whatever track she\u2019s listening to, humming quietly. Her hair is twisted over one shoulder, slightly longer than Chloe\u2019s ever seen it and perhaps a shade lighter from the sun.</p>\n<p>As Chloe watches, Beca seems to finish whatever she\u2019s doing because saves and closes her laptop, unplugging her headphones and pulling them down around her neck. She stands up and turns around, and Chloe is about to say something, but Beca sees her before she can.</p>\n<p>\u201cDUDE!\u201d</p>\n<p>Beca jumps, her hand coming up over her chest.</p>\n<p>\u201cSorry! Sorry!\u201d Chloe laughs sheepishly.</p>\n<p>Beca stares at her, eyes wide. She lowers her hands and is suddenly\u2026 laughing.</p>\n<p>Chloe tilts her head to the side, grinning. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p>\n<p>Beca just shakes her head, grabbing at her side. Chloe waits for her to stop laughing, which she does after what feels like a century.</p>\n<p>\u201cSorry,\u201d Beca says, gulping air into her lungs as her laughter dies down. \u201cThat just reminded me of\u2026\u201d She trails off, stomach shaking with laughter again.</p>\n<p>Chloe raises her eyebrows, but then suddenly she gets it. She beams. \u201cHow high does your belt go?\u201d</p>\n<p>Beca snorts through a laugh, her hand coming up to pinch her nose. \u201cI still can\u2019t believe you did that.\u201d</p>\n<p>Chloe shrugs. \u201cI knew you could sing, you dirty liar.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhatever.\u201d Beca rolls her eyes. \u201cYou\u2019re still a creepy stalker.\u201d</p>\n<p>Chloe gasps playfully. \u201cI\u2019m not creepy!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut you admit you\u2019re a stalker?\u201d Beca raises an eyebrow.</p>\n<p>\u201cMaybe\u2026\u201d Chloe grins again. \u201cYou love it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUh huh\u2026\u201d Beca thins her lips, trying not to smile.</p>\n<p>Chloe just shakes her head fondly, putting an arm around her friend. \u201cCome on, my tiny, dorky friend. Let\u2019s get dinner.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not a dork,\u201d Beca grumbles, but she lets Chloe lead her to the car.</p>\n<p>As they drive to get dinner, windows down, both of them belting to top 40 hits on the radio, Chloe feels like the past two years apart had barely even happened.</p>\n<p>//</p>\n<p>They settle into a rhythm. Chloe manages to get a job at a private high school teaching choir. She likes it enough, but the kids get on her nerves sometimes.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Still, it\u2019s different from what she was doing back home and L.A. makes her feel alive in ways that only singing for an audience used to. She loves the sun and the beach and listening to Beca\u2019s music as they drive in her convertible with the top down.</p>\n<p>(\u201cWhat the hell, Bec, since when did you get a convertible?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhatever,\u201d Beca scoffed. \u201cIt\u2019s L.A. Everyone has a convertible.\u201d)</p>\n<p>And even more so, she loves living with Beca. It\u2019s different than when she lived in the Bella House, half of which she roomed with Aubrey, the other three years of which she roomed with Stacie while Beca shared the upstairs loft with Amy.</p>\n<p>Beca\u2019s currently working on a new album with some DJ//singer Chloe\u2019s never heard of before (apparently he\u2019s \u2018the next big thing\u2019 according to Beca) and she works mostly from home.</p>\n<p>Sometimes, Chloe comes home from teaching in the afternoon to find Beca shut in her studio, headphones clamped over her ears, back hunched over her laptop. More often than not, though, Beca is in the kitchen cooking when Chloe walks through the door, music mixing with the smells of whatever\u2019s steaming on the stove.</p>\n<p>Today is one of those days. Beca\u2019s singing to some Jessie J while she fusses over a pan when Chloe gets home.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey,\u201d Chloe says, setting her keys down.</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2019Sup?\u201d Beca glances at her with a small smile before turning her attention back to the stove.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat are you making?\u201d Chloe sits down at the island, watching as Beca rolls up the sleeves of her purple flannel and reaches down to open the oven door.</p>\n<p>Beca grabs a towel and pulls a pan out of the oven. \u201cChicken. And vegetables. I made those peppers you like.\u201d</p>\n<p>Chloe hums in approval. \u201cYay, you\u2019re the best.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Beca says, taking the pan of vegetables off the stove. \u201cI was thinking we could eat and watch a movie or something. I finished the last track of the album so I don\u2019t really have to do much tomorrow while I wait for feedback from Marcus and I got us some wine and \u2013 \u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhoa, whoa, whoa!\u201d Chloe raises her eyebrows incredulously. \u201cFirst, you finished the album? And second, you hate movies.\u201d</p>\n<p>Beca shrugs. \u201cWell, yeah, but you don\u2019t.\u201d</p>\n<p>Chloe tilts her head to the side with a smile. \u201cYou finished the album?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Beca averts her eyes, turning back to pull two plates out of the cupboard. \u201cI mean, it still has to go through review and I\u2019m sure it\u2019ll need to be tweaked a lot, knowing Marcus anyway.\u201d</p>\n<p>Chloe softens. Beca is so cute when she\u2019s trying to pretend things aren\u2019t a big deal. She\u2019s reminded of when she found out Beca even made music, way back when, and how Beca had tried to convince Aubrey that they needed to change their sound, throwing her talent out there so casually like it was nothing. She remembers how Aubrey had stormed away, the Bellas following close behind, but Chloe had leaned closer, asking Beca if she could listen. Beca had just shrugged, handing Chloe her headphones, nonchalantly sitting there while Chloe\u2019s mind was blown.</p>\n<p>\u201cCongratulations, Beca,\u201d Chloe says, feeling the way pride fills her chest, swelling in her ribcage.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s, you know, whatever, like I said,\u201d Beca murmurs, standing on her tiptoes to reach for the wine glasses. She\u2019s just a little too short to reach. \u201cIt\u2019s not like, one hundred percent done, so.\u201d</p>\n<p>Chloe rolls her eyes fondly, getting up and moving around the island. She moves next to Beca, reaching up to get the wine glasses with a small smirk. Beca looks over at her as their arms brush.</p>\n<p>\u201cStill,\u201d Chloe says, setting the glasses down on the island. \u201cYou\u2019re right, we should celebrate.\u201d</p>\n<p>Beca nods. \u201cWith wine.\u201d</p>\n<p>Chloe giggles. \u201cObviously.\u201d</p>\n<p>Beca grins and starts piling food on the plates. Chloe opens a bottle of wine, pouring it in their glasses. They head over to the couch, setting the plates and glasses on the coffee table. Chloe sits on the floor between the couch and the table and Beca follows her, reaching for the remote.</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you even own any movies?\u201d Chloe asks, voice teasing.</p>\n<p>Beca rolls her eyes. \u201cExcuse you, I own On Demand.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo that\u2019s a no.\u201d Chloe grins.</p>\n<p>Beca scoffs. \u201cI was going to let you pick the movie, but you can forget that now.\u201d</p>\n<p>Chloe raises her eyebrows, leaning over to snatch the remote from Beca\u2019s hands. \u201cSnooze ya lose.\u201d She turns the TV on, scrolling through the movie channels.</p>\n<p>Beca shakes her head, hiding her smile in her glass. \u201cJust don\u2019t pick something lame.\u201d</p>\n<p>Chloe grins. \u201cNo promises.\u201d</p>\n<p>//</p>\n<p>They\u2019re halfway through the movie and their second bottle of wine. They\u2019d migrated to the couch about twenty minutes into the movie and now their empty plates sit on the coffee table. Chloe has her head in Beca\u2019s lap and Beca taps the fingers of one of her hands on Chloe\u2019s collarbones to the music playing in the movie. Chloe plays with Beca\u2019s other hand, twisting her ring around and around.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo this is kind of weird, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Beca says over the movie.</p>\n<p>Chloe snaps her eyes up to Beca\u2019s face. \u201cWhat is?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re like, old.\u201d Beca scrunches her face up, clearly displeased by the thought.</p>\n<p>Chloe grins, wine-drunk and content. \u201cWe\u2019re not that old. And whatever, you\u2019re what, twenty-four? That\u2019s not old, Becs.\u201d</p>\n<p>Beca just smirks, tapping at Chloe\u2019s forehead with her free hand. \u201cOkay, but we\u2019re like domestic and shit.\u201d She smiles, barking out a short laugh. \u201cWe\u2019re like, married.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMarried?\u201d Chloe wonders if maybe Beca is drunker than she thought.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah. Like you go to work and come home and I make you dinner and then we cuddle up on the couch with our wine and watch movies.\u201d Beca laughs again and Chloe feels her body shake with it. \u201cWe\u2019re fucking married.\u201d</p>\n<p>Chloe giggles. \u201cIf you liked it then you should\u2019ve put a ring on it,\u201d she says, slipping the ring off Beca\u2019s finger and sliding it over her own.</p>\n<p>Beca snorts. \u201cOr at least made it Facebook official.\u201d</p>\n<p>Chloe grins. \u201cThere\u2019s still time.\u201d She grabs Beca\u2019s phone off the coffee table.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey!\u201d Beca reaches for the phone. \u201cNo!\u201d</p>\n<p>She sits up, moving away from Beca, the wine making her cheeks flush warmly. \u201cMake me!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cChloe!\u201d Beca whines, playfully kicking at Chloe with her foot. Chloe just sticks out her tongue, pulling up Facebook on Beca\u2019s phone. \u201cOh, really mature. I take it back, you\u2019re actually five.\u201d</p>\n<p>Chloe\u2019s body shakes with laughter and Beca is giggling (she must be drunk, Chloe thinks, because Beca <em>does not</em> giggle), but has stopped reaching for her phone. Chloe navigates through the pages and a few clicks later, she\u2019s finished. She feels her own phone buzz with a notification and she pulls it out of her pocket.</p>\n<p>She accepts the relationship change easily and then it\u2019s done.</p>\n<p>\u201cThere!\u201d She grins at Beca. \u201cWe\u2019re officially engaged, Ms. Mitchell.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIf you didn\u2019t Instagram and Tweet it, though, did it really happen?\u201d Beca asks sarcastically.</p>\n<p>Chloe\u2019s eyes widen. \u201cYou\u2019re so right.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m kidding, Chlo. Chloe!\u201d Beca tries to hide her face, but Chloe has already leaned up against her and snapped a picture. Chloe\u2019s grinning at the camera, but Beca is laughing down at her and it\u2019s actually probably the cutest picture they\u2019ve ever taken. Which isn\u2019t that surprising. Beca always pretends to be grumpy when Chloe wants to take selfies.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis is cute,\u201d Chloe says, quickly choosing a filter and uploading it on Instagram. She links it to Twitter and hands Beca her phone back. \u201c<em>Now</em> it\u2019s official.\u201d</p>\n<p>Beca rolls her eyes. \u201cOh my God, you\u2019re so dumb.\u201d Then she grins again. \u201cWhatever, maybe our friends will send us engagement gifts. Then we can get that espresso machine.\u201d Her eyes glaze over at the thought.</p>\n<p>Chloe snorts. \u201cOkay, you just work on getting me my ring.\u201d She wiggles her hand in the air.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll look into it,\u201d Beca nods, taking on a faux air of seriousness. They both erupt into laughter, grinning at each other. Chloe can\u2019t remember feeling this happy in a really long time, maybe since graduation.</p>\n<p>She lays her head back down on Beca\u2019s lap, pressing a smile into Beca\u2019s legs.</p>\n<p>In seconds, Beca\u2019s fingers return to tapping at her forehead, and Chloe brings her attention back to the movie on the screen.</p>\n<p>She doesn\u2019t remember the end of the movie, just the tapping of Beca\u2019s fingers easing her into a contented sleep.</p>\n<p>//</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\n<strong>LIFE EVENT</strong>\n</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\n<strong>BECA MITCHELL got engaged to CHLOE BEALE</strong>\n</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\n<strong>October 5, 2018</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Emily Junk, Stacie Conrad, Benji Applebaum and 97 others like this</p>\n<p><strong>Fat Amy</strong> it\u2019s about time took u guys longer than a wallaby waiting to skinny dip to get on that train wow</p>\n<p><strong>Stacie Conrad </strong>omg you guys!!! :) congratulations!

Imma send you a toaster ASAP</p>\n<p><strong>Aubrey Posen</strong> Chloe Beale call me right now</p>\n<p>//</p>\n<p>Beca wakes to the buzzing of her phone on her nightstand. She flings her arm out, feeling around for it blindly. She hates mornings. And she <em>really</em> hates whoever is calling her at\u2026 She squints her eyes open.</p>\n<p>7:43 AM.</p>\n<p>She groans, just as the buzzing stops.</p>\n<p>Thank God.</p>\n<p>She settles back into her pillow, rolling over slightly and bumping into Chloe.</p>\n<p>Chloe?</p>\n<p>Before she can process that, her doorbell rings. She squeezes her eyes shut, hoping the person will go away. It seems like they will. There\u2019s a minute of silence. Then \u2013</p>\n<p>The doorbell rings again. And again. And again and again and \u2013</p>\n<p>\u201cOKAY!\u201d Beca yells. \u201cWhat the fuck?\u201d</p>\n<p>She swings her feet out of bed and pads down the hallway in her tank top and pajama pants.</p>\n<p>\u201cDude,\u201d she says as she opens the door. \u201cWhat the \u2013 \u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cExplain yourself!\u201d Suddenly there\u2019s a finger under her nose.</p>\n<p>Beca zeroes in on the finger, brain taking forever to process, heavy and slow in the way that only comes from a night of drinking wine.</p>\n<p>\u201cUhh.\u201d She looks up with a scowl. \u201cLindsey, what the fuck?\u201d</p>\n<p>The woman, only slightly taller than Beca, pushes her raven-black hair behind her ears and scowls right back, an action Beca has become very familiar with in the year that she\u2019s know the woman. \u201cYes, Beca. What the fuck is right.\u201d</p>\n<p>Beca crosses her arms, jutting her chin out defiantly. \u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about, but I\u2019m 99 percent sure it could\u2019ve waited until at least noon.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lindsey, in all her combat-boot and skinny-jeaned glory, ignores that and pushes her way past Beca and into the house.</p>\n<p>\u201cExcuse you,\u201d Beca says, rolling her eyes and closing the door as she follows the woman into the house and down the hall. They get to the kitchen and Lindsey immediately starts brewing a pot of coffee like she shows up at Beca\u2019s house at ungodly hours of the morning all the time.</p>\n<p>Which, just to be clear, she doesn\u2019t.</p>\n<p>\u201cBeca?\u201d Chloe wanders into the kitchen in that moment, all bed-head and sleep-wrinkled t-shirt. \u201cWho was at the door?\u201d She asks through a yawn, causing Lindsey to whip around.</p>\n<p>\u201cAha!\u201d She points her accusatory finger at Chloe. \u201cYou!\u201d</p>\n<p>Chloe just slumps on a stool, leaning her head on her hand sleepily. \u201cAre you making coffee? Can you pour me some?\u201d</p>\n<p>Lindsey\u2019s face twists in confused incredulity and Beca stifles a grin behind another scowl. Just-woken-up Chloe is one of her favorite things, but she\u2019s a little too pissed at Lindsey right now to fully appreciate it.</p>\n<p>\u201cUmm, hello?\u201d Beca gestures at Lindsey. \u201cYou still haven\u2019t explained why you\u2019re here?\u201d</p>\n<p>Lindsey just stares at Chloe, completely disregarding Beca. Which like, wow. Rude. \u201cFigures. Ginger,\u201d she mutters and Chloe quirks her eyebrows. \u201cWell, you did have that thing for Ed Sheeran.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLindsey.\u201d Beca scowls.</p>\n<p>\u201cEd Sheeran?\u201d Chloe says, still completely unfazed by the woman in their kitchen. \u201cWhat about Ed Sheeran?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNothing,\u201d Lindsey says as the coffee pot beeps. She pulls down a few mugs. \u201cJust that Beca clearly has a thing for gingers.\u201d</p>\n<p>Beca grits her teeth. \u201cOkay no. You know what! Everybody loves Ed Sheeran!\u201d</p>\n<p>Chloe nods amicably. \u201cVery true.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lindsey sets a full mug of coffee in front of each of them. Tendrils of steam rise from the mugs and Beca watches as Chloe blows at hers gently.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo,\u201d Lindsey says, a touch of condescension coloring her tone. \u201cWhen were you going to tell me about this?\u201d</p>\n<p>Beca throws her arms in the air. \u201cDude! Tell you about what?\u201d</p>\n<p>Lindsey waves her finger between Beca and Chloe. \u201cAbout the two of you? You know, that you\u2019re dating? And I don\u2019t know\u2026 engaged?!\u201d Lindsey\u2019s voice lilts hysterically. \u201cI am your <em>publicist</em>! You are supposed to clear these things with me!\u201d</p>\n<p>Beca\u2019s jaw drops. Oh shit.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou have a publicist?\u201d Chloe nods, impressed.</p>\n<p>Beca sighs. \u201cThis is Lindsey. Lindsey, Chloe.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou mean Instagram user <em>gingrspiceandevrythingnice</em>?\u201d Lindsey glares at Beca, unamused.</p>\n<p>Chloe grins in a way that Beca can only associate with springtime sun, bright and welcoming. \u201cThat\u2019s me!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGreat.\u201d Lindsey\u2019s tone suggests it\u2019s anything but. \u201cSo maybe the two of you can explain this post.\u201d She makes a big show of whipping out her phone and clearing her throat. \u201c<em>BecaMitchell</em>: <em>Liked it, so I put a ring on it @gingrspiceandevrythingnice #engaged</em>. Accompanied by <em>this</em> picture,\u201d Lindsey turns the phone around so they can see, \u201cand tweeted to your 18,372 Twitter followers!\u201d</p>\n<p>Beca glances at the picture on the screen, clearly from last night. It\u2019s cute, she thinks vaguely, as Lindsey shoves her phone back in her pocket. \u201cThat was a joke,\u201d she murmurs. Chloe wraps her hands around her warm mug, uncharacteristically demure.</p>\n<p>\u201cA joke?!\u201d Lindsey seems on her way to an aneurysm.</p>\n<p>\u201cUh, yeah, dude.\u201d Beca shrugs. \u201cCalm down.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lindsey spins around as if she can\u2019t bear the thought of looking at them any longer, her jacket almost hitting Beca in the face. Beca rolls her eyes. Drama queen. And that\u2019s saying something. She lived in the same house as Stacie Conrad for three years.</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Beca says, trying to regain control of the morning. \u201cSorry, we made a mistake.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMy bad,\u201d Chloe whispers, her eyebrows knitting together.</p>\n<p>Beca shrugs. \u201cLindsey, it\u2019s fine. I\u2019ll just tweet that it was a joke.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lindsey shakes her head, fingers coming to rub at her temple. \u201cBeca, honestly.\u201d Her voice is strained. \u201cIt\u2019s not that easy.\u201d</p>\n<p>Beca raises an eyebrow. \u201cWhy not? Sure it is.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBeca, you have an image now \u2013 \u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh god.\u201d Beca pretends to gag. \u201cDon\u2019t rope me into that bullshit. I\u2019m hardly even famous.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lindsey turns on her. \u201cWhile that may be true, you have already decided to be open about your sexuality, Beca, and now there are young girls out there whose dreams seem to be coming true as they see someone like them being proudly out and engaged. Someone successful in a field where women aren\u2019t that prominent! Especially LGBT women! And now you\u2019re just going to tell them that \u2018it was just a joke\u2019?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWait.\u201d Chloe speaks up. \u201cOpen about what sexuality?\u201d</p>\n<p>Beca thins her lips as Lindsey waves her off nonchalantly. \u201cBeca\u2019s bisexuality, of course.\u201d</p>\n<p>Chloe\u2019s eyes snap to hers. \u201cWhat? Since when?\u201d</p>\n<p>Beca averts her eyes. This is perhaps the most mortifying morning of her life. Or top three at the very least. \u201cIt was that German woman,\u201d Beca mutters, embarrassed.</p>\n<p>Chloe\u2019s mouth drops open, appalled. \u201cFrom Das Sound Machine?!\u201d</p>\n<p>Beca gestures wildly again. \u201cShe was physically flawless!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh my God!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd if it wasn\u2019t her, well you <em>did</em> force me to sing a duet with you while we were in the shower! Naked!\u201d Beca crosses her arms. Chloe snaps her mouth shut.</p>\n<p>Lindsey looks between the two of them. \u201cI thought you weren\u2019t dating?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re not,\u201d Beca grumbles.</p>\n<p>\u201cThen why\u2026\u201d Lindsey shakes her head. \u201cYou know what? Never mind.\u201d</p>\n<p>Beca huffs. \u201cOkay, so what do we do?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell,\u201d Lindsey drawls. \u201cI mean it\u2019s up to you, of course. If you want to say it\u2019s a joke, go ahead. But obviously I don\u2019t recommend that \u2013 \u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLindsey,\u201d Beca snaps. \u201cWhat are the other options?\u201d</p>\n<p>Lindsey taps her finger on her chin. \u201cWell, the standard procedure in this case would be to release a statement about the engagement. Keep the charade up for a few months \u2013 \u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cA few months?!\u201d Beca practically yelps.</p>\n<p>Lindsey glares at her and continues. \u201cThen we would release a new statement at an opportune time, stating that the relationship didn\u2019t work out and the breakup was mutual.\u201d</p>\n<p>Beca frowns, suddenly feeling like she\u2019s way in over her head. She leans against the island, thinking.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat does \u2018keeping the charade up\u2019 entail?\u201d Chloe asks. Beca feels her eyes on her, but she\u2019s operating in some kind of daze now.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell,\u201d Lindsey says, finally sipping at her coffee. Beca\u2019s remains untouched. \u201cFirst, we put out a small statement. Beca\u2019s not nearly in the public eye enough for any articles or anything, so that shouldn\u2019t be an issue. Perhaps a few public outings. If Beca has to attend any events, it would be pretty standard of you to tag along, keep up appearances and all that jazz.\u201d</p>\n<p>Chloe hums thoughtfully. \u201cJust a few months?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, probably two or three.\u201d Lindsey nods. \u201cIt\u2019s really barely any time at all. Obviously, you\u2019d have to abstain from other relationships, and the hardest part would be keeping it from your friends, of course, but the time will be over before you know it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWait, we can\u2019t tell our friends?\u201d</p>\n<p>Beca almost smiles at Chloe\u2019s puppy-dog pout, but she\u2019s heard the mantra enough, and Lindsey wastes no time repeating it. \u201cCan\u2019t trust anyone in this business.\u201d</p>\n<p>Chloe frowns. \u201cAnd what if Beca just says it was a joke?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell besides coming off as an asshole,\u201d Beca snorts, but Lindsey ignores her, \u201cshe could receive fan backlash and the label might put her on probation from recording until it all blows over. The record she\u2019s working on with Marcus Sentry could see delayed release dates.\u201d Lindsey shrugs as if to say that\u2019s the least of it.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s silence for a minute, Lindsey nonchalantly sipping her coffee, Chloe staring at Beca, Beca staring into space.</p>\n<p>\u201cBecs.\u201d Chloe leans closer, placing her hand on top of Beca\u2019s. Beca pulls away and Chloe frowns. \u201cIt\u2019s up to you of course. Whatever you want to do.\u201d</p>\n<p>Beca just sighs. She doesn\u2019t care that much about coming off like an asshole (okay, maybe she cares a little, but like, not <em>that</em> much), but they\u2019re so close to being done with the album and they worked so hard on it\u2026</p>\n<p>Her dreams are right there. She\u2019s so close.</p>\n<p>She meets Chloe\u2019s eyes, the blueness in them pulling her in, familiar and warm. \u201cSo I guess we\u2019re engaged, huh?\u201d</p>\n<p>Chloe\u2019s lips pull up in a small smile. \u201cOnly if you want to be.\u201d</p>\n<p>Beca turns to Lindsey. \u201cFine. Only for a few months.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lindsey nods, reaching into the bag she brought with her for her laptop. \u201cSo, I\u2019m just going to have to get some background information on this deal and then I\u2019ll write up the statement.\u201d</p>\n<p>They sit at the island for another two hours, hashing out the imaginary details of their relationship, although Beca admits most of them are true. They met at college, they sang in the Bellas, Chloe moved here, they got engaged. The rest is history. Literally.</p>\n<p>When Lindsey finally leaves, Beca disappears into her studio for the rest of the day, hoping to bring the roaring headache in her brain down to a dull roar.</p>\n<p>She really did not expect her Saturday to go like this.</p>\n<p>//</p>\n<p>Things are awkward between them for a few days.</p>\n<p>Not awkward in the sense where either of them is mad, but Chloe senses Beca feels overwhelmed and wants to be alone. Which Chloe understands. Sort of. Not for her personally, but for Beca anyway.</p>\n<p>Lindsey, the publicist (which like, Beca has a publicist? WTF?), informs them that the label encourages them to keep up their fa\u00e7ade at least until after the album drops, which is scheduled for the first week of November.</p>\n<p>Apparently Marcus is in love with it, or that\u2019s what Beca tells Chloe a few days after they Get Engaged. Chloe\u2019s not surprised. Who isn\u2019t in love with Beca\u2019s music?</p>\n<p>(The way Lindsey talks about Beca\u2019s small but loyal fanbase and the heads at the label, Chloe\u2019s starting to wonder who isn\u2019t in love with <em>Beca </em>herself, really.)</p>\n<p>So it\u2019s a week of awkward dinners where Chloe talks about their boring school-approved set-list for her school\u2019s woman\u2019s fall choir concert and where Beca kinda just nods in a very Beca-fashion and mumbles things here and there about Lindsey being a dumb ass.</p>\n<p>Chloe is resilient and well-versed in waiting out Beca\u2019s moods, but after so many years of Beca being open with her (at least more open than she is with other people) it makes Chloe sad and kind of wears her down.</p>\n<p>While they sit on the couch in their PJs and eat Chinese take-out and watch Netflix, Chloe doesn\u2019t think the distance between them has ever been so massive.</p>\n<p>And that\u2019s not just because Beca is sitting way over on the other end of the couch.</p>\n<p>Chloe knows that Beca hates games and she hates being fake and that no amount of butting heads will get her to change who she is. One agonizing year of constant Aubrey-Beca bickering taught her as much. So she totally gets why Beca\u2019s in a mood.</p>\n<p>She just doesn\u2019t know how to fix it and it\u2019s making her totally sad.</p>\n<p>\u201cButt-chin is totally gonna get chopped,\u201d Beca says from the other end of the couch. Honestly, Chloe never thought their couch was that big until now.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, Blondie is.\u201d Chloe shakes her head at the disgusting excuse for cr\u00e8me brulee on the screen.</p>\n<p>Beca snorts. \u201cButt-chin fucked up vegetables. How do you fuck up vegetables?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBet you an eggroll it\u2019s Blondie.\u201d</p>\n<p>Beca scoffs. \u201cDeal.\u201d</p>\n<p>They watch the clock run down in silence, Chloe picking at her Chinese food, wondering how they got to this awkward place. She can feel herself pouting into her sesame chicken during the commercial break, but she doesn\u2019t even care.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey,\u201d Beca says, turning down the volume of the TV as some insurance commercial comes on. \u201cDo you like\u2026 have plans or whatever this Saturday?\u201d</p>\n<p>Chloe\u2019s eyes slip over to Beca, watching as the other girl pokes at her lo mein with her chopsticks and avoids Chloe\u2019s gaze.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, not really.\u201d She was thinking of attending a spin class, but that\u2019s hardly having plans. She chews on the inside of her lip, watching Beca.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou want to go to the beach or something?\u201d Beca glances at her quickly before shooting her eyes away.</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Chloe says cautiously. Which is weird because she\u2019s never really been a cautious person, but sometimes Beca has a way of making her not say the things she might say to anyone else.</p>\n<p>Beca nods. \u201cCool.\u201d She quirks her lips in a small smile and turns the volume of the TV up just as the show comes back on.</p>\n<p>Chloe\u2019s stomach buzzes, like there are bees inside of it instead of butterflies, riled up and anxious. She doesn\u2019t have time to think about it though because a minute later, Blondie gets chopped and Beca swears loudly.</p>\n<p>\u201cPass me your eggroll,\u201d Chloe says gloatingly. She always wins.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis show is fucking rigged.\u201d Beca scowls. \u201cYou\u2019ve seen it before.\u201d</p>\n<p>Chloe shakes her head, grinning. \u201cNo, I haven\u2019t.\u201d</p>\n<p>Beca leans over to pass her the eggroll, grumbling to herself about Chloe being a cheater, but when she settles back against the other end of the couch, her feet land in Chloe\u2019s lap and her lips are twisting in the way that means she\u2019s holding back a smile.</p>\n<p>Chloe grins and bites into her new delicious prize, the buzzing in her stomach settling.</p>\n<p>//</p>\n<p>Things slowly return back to normal over the next couple of weeks. Chloe\u2019s mom has trouble grasping that the engagement isn\u2019t real, but she\u2019s working on it.</p>\n<p>Besides, it turns out that they don\u2019t actually really have to <em>do</em> anything because nobody gives a shit that Beca is engaged except for her tiny fanbase.</p>\n<p>That being said, Chloe gains like 500 Instagram followers which is weird, but Beca\u2019s fans seem really nice, if not a little enthusiastic.</p>\n<p>Still, they go back to being just Beca-and-Chloe and Chloe breathes easier as November 2<sup>nd</sup> gets closer and closer with every passing day.</p>\n<p>//</p>\n<p>The album drops with greater success than Beca imagined.</p>\n<p>She guesses she shouldn\u2019t have been surprised. Marcus has the voice of an old-time crooner and it fits with her beats in ways she never thought would have been possible. Plus, he\u2019s apparently a heartthrob, but it\u2019s not like she\u2019s noticed.</p>\n<p>Sure, she guesses he\u2019s got these fantastic brown eyes and really great hair, but it doesn\u2019t faze her much. She\u2019s fake-engaged to Chloe Beale. She\u2019s accustomed to seeing beautiful eyes and great hair on the daily, and if she\u2019s being honest, way closer-up than she sees Marcus Sentry\u2019s.</p>\n<p>Still, the fans go crazy over him. It\u2019s enough to make her gag.</p>\n<p>Beca can\u2019t say she minds, though. Not when she comes home to find Chloe jumping around the living room as the album bumps through Beca\u2019s high-quality sound system, an expensive bottle of celebratory champagne in the kitchen, and the possibility of finally achieving her dreams sitting just at her fingertips.</p>\n<p>//</p>\n<p>Chloe can pinpoint the exact moment that Beca\u2019s career blows up.</p>\n<p>She\u2019s driving home from work, absentmindedly thinking about her classes, and humming along to the radio. It\u2019s L.A., so she\u2019s been stuck in traffic for at least twenty minutes now on the same stretch of highway, but she doesn\u2019t mind that much because it\u2019s Friday and it\u2019s warm out and Beca had hinted at breakfast for dinner.</p>\n<p>The song on the radio fades into a new one, and after just a few seconds, Chloe gasps. She\u2019s heard Beca\u2019s songs on the radio before, back when she first released her EP, but there\u2019s something about knowing how hard Beca slaved over this track firsthand that makes it feel extra special.</p>\n<p>She grins, singing along to the sultry sound of Marcus\u2019 voice, head bopping to the underlying beat that Beca created. She feels so happy she could scream, and she practically does, whooping a little as the song ends and the DJs come back on the air.</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cThis is Kyle and Booster and you\u2019re listening to RLA. How about that hot track from Marcus Sentry and Beca Mitchell?\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>Chloe grins. \u201cYeah, how about it,\u201d she says to herself.</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cThose are some fresh beats, Kyle, and it seems like we\u2019re not the only ones who are noticing.\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cNo doubt, Boost. Rolling Stone Online published their Top 30 Up-and-Coming Artists yesterday, and we were definitely not surprised to see those two on the list.\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>Chloe almost slams on the breaks. She would have. Except she\u2019s practically already at a stop. Damn traffic.</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cCheck out their new album On the Rocks, just out last week, it\u2019s got a great sound. You\u2019re listening to RLA\u2019s Kyle and Booster. We\u2019ll be back after these short messages.\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>The radio cuts to a commercial and Chloe kind of just gapes in shock for a few moments. She <em>has</em> to tell Beca. Like, now.</p>\n<p>DAMN TRAFFIC.</p>\n<p>//</p>\n<p>Not only is Beca on Rolling Stone Online\u2019s Top 30 Up-and-Coming Artists, but she\u2019s third.</p>\n<p>Marcus is second and the number one spot goes to some YouTube sensation (Beca really hopes he\u2019s not the next Justin Bieber). But still. She\u2019s third.</p>\n<p>\u00a0She doesn\u2019t really know what it all means.</p>\n<p>//</p>\n<p>She finds out what it means three days later.</p>\n<p>Lindsey conference calls her with some higher ups at the label, starts talking her ear off about the new Wachowski movie and Beca\u2019s not really paying attention that much because, yeah, she still isn\u2019t really that into movies.</p>\n<p>But then they\u2019re saying something about the Wachowskis being obsessed with her and scoring and a soundtrack and Beca\u2019s mind does this short-circuiting thing that she\u2019s pretty sure makes her eyes bulge.</p>\n<p>\u201cThey want <em>me</em> to score their movie?\u201d Beca forgets how to breathe for a second. \u201cBut I\u2019ve never scored a movie before. Dude. What?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter, Beca,\u201d intones Robert, some head dude Beca usually lets Lindsey deal with. \u201cThey think your sound is perfect for the movie. Think about it.\u201d They hang up soon after, leaving Beca completely flummoxed and under pressure to make a decision.</p>\n<p>She thinks about it for a really long time before she calls them back.</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019ll do it, but only if I can collaborate with someone. I get to pick.\u201d</p>\n<p>They get back to her an hour later. \u201cBring whoever you want. Assemble a team if you need to. They want you, Beca. Don\u2019t pass this up.\u201d</p>\n<p>//</p>\n<p>\u201cNew York, Newwww Yoooooorrrkkkk!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh my God, please stop.\u201d Beca swats Jesse\u2019s arm. She\u2019s kind of regretting the decision to bring him into this deal. He\u2019s drawing attention to them. In the airport. She scowls.</p>\n<p>\u201cCome on, Becs!\u201d He spins around. \u201cWe\u2019re in New York. We\u2019re working on a movie. The Wachowski movie.\u201d</p>\n<p>Beca rolls her eyes. \u201cI still don\u2019t really know what that means.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jesse looks scandalized. \u201cThey did <em>X-Men</em>. And <em>V for Vendetta</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>Beca just shrugs. \u201cHaven\u2019t seen them.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Jupiter Ascending?</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>Beca shakes her head.</p>\n<p>\u201cHow did we even date for three years?\u201d Jesse groans. \u201cCan you at least pretend to be excited about this?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo.\u201d Beca grabs his arm, leading him to the guy in a suit holding a sign that says her name on it. At least the service is good.</p>\n<p>They\u2019re just there for a meeting with the Wachowskis. To talk about their vision or whatever. They fly home again tomorrow to start working on the music.</p>\n<p>She hates this part of the music industry (or movie industry now, she guesses). The talking, the schmoozing, the socializing, the <em>vision</em>.</p>\n<p>She just wants to make music.</p>\n<p>But still, Jesse\u2019s excited, and she guesses she can\u2019t fault him that. It is kind of a big deal.</p>\n<p>She\u2019s trying not to think about that part.</p>\n<p>//</p>\n<p>The meeting goes well enough. Beca admits it\u2019s pretty exciting as she feels herself getting swept up in the possibilities ahead of them. The movie, some sci-fi flick featuring a half-lioness girl from a different planet, seems really fucking weird, but Beca sees <em>the vision</em> (ugh) and she\u2019s suddenly completely on board.</p>\n<p>Still, the meeting lasts all day, and she\u2019s getting really tired of Jesse smiling at the Wachowskis like he\u2019s on shrooms or something. It\u2019s overwhelming and she just wants to be back home on the couch in her sweats, Chloe\u2019s head in her lap and shitty TV on in the background.</p>\n<p>Beca calls her the second she\u2019s back in her hotel room, away from Jesse and the never-ending rush of the city.</p>\n<p>Chloe answers after the second ring. <em>\u201cHello?\u201d</em></p>\n<p>\u201cHey,\u201d Beca says, voice going soft as she sinks down into her bed. \u201cIt\u2019s me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Chloe giggles. <em>\u201cI know, Becs. I have caller ID.\u201d</em></p>\n<p>Beca rolls her eyes. \u201cRight.\u201d</p>\n<p>Chloe hums into the phone and Beca wonders what she\u2019s doing. <em>\u201cHow was the meeting?\u201d</em></p>\n<p>\u201cIt was good actually,\u201d Beca admits. \u201cThe Wachowskis are really fucking weird, though. And Jesse wouldn\u2019t stop grinning like one of these creepy circus clowns the whole time.\u201d</p>\n<p><em>\u201cI hate those clowns.\u201d</em> Chloe scoffs and Beca smiles a little.</p>\n<p>\u201cMe, too. What are you doing?\u201d</p>\n<p>Chloe sighs. <em>\u201cWaiting for my pizza to get here. It\u2019s been like forty-five minutes. I\u2019m starving.\u201d</em></p>\n<p>Beca suppresses a smile. \u201cNo cooking, then?\u201d</p>\n<p><em>\u201cI tried, but let\u2019s just say it\u2019s a good thing I\u2019m marrying a halfway decent chef.\u201d</em> Beca can feel Chloe\u2019s grin through the phone. <em>\u201cI burned grilled cheese.\u201d</em></p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s just tragic.\u201d</p>\n<p><em>\u201cUgh, I know.\u201d</em> Chloe clears her throat. <em>\u201cAre you okay, Becs?\u201d</em></p>\n<p>Beca crinkles her nose. \u201cYeah, why?\u201d</p>\n<p><em>\u201cYou just sound\u2026 I don\u2019t know.\u201d</em> Chloe hums thoughtfully. <em>\u201cUn-Beca-ey.\u201d</em></p>\n<p>\u201cIt was just a really long day, I guess.\u201d Beca frowns. \u201cYou know I suck at being social. But at least the Wachowskis were as awkward as me.\u201d</p>\n<p><em>\u201cNot as cute though, I\u2019m sure.\u201d</em> Chloe giggles again.</p>\n<p>Beca\u2019s chest feels light. \u201cCuter, actually.\u201d</p>\n<p><em>\u201cI doubt it,\u201d</em> Chloe says. <em>\u201cSo what are you going to do now?\u201d</em></p>\n<p>Beca shrugs, glancing at the clock. \u201cJesse and I are going to go out and get a drink or two, I guess.\u201d</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cSoon?\u201d </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u201cUh.\u201d Beca bites her lip. \u201cI was supposed to meet him five minutes ago.\u201d</p>\n<p><em>\u201cBeca!\u201d</em> Chloe laughs. <em>\u201cYou\u2019re the worst.\u201d</em></p>\n<p>\u201cI wanted to talk to you,\u201d Beca whines. Then she snaps her mouth shut. Did that come out as needy as it sounded?</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a beat of silence. Beca can hear Chloe breathing on the other end of the line.</p>\n<p><em>\u201cYeah,\u201d</em> Chloe says after a moment. <em>\u201cMe, too.\u201d</em></p>\n<p>Beca exhales in\u2026 something. Relief maybe. \u201cI should probably go now.\u201d</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cOkay. I\u2019ll see you tomorrow when your flight gets in.\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re still picking us up right?\u201d</p>\n<p>Chloe laughs. <em>\u201cDuh.\u201d</em></p>\n<p>\u201cCool.\u201d Beca nods. \u201cAlright then, bye.\u201d</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cLove you, Becs.\u201d </em>\n</p>\n<p>Beca grins. \u201cYou too. Bye.\u201d</p>\n<p>She hangs up and decides not to change. Jesse is going to complain enough about how late she is.</p>\n<p>Like she needs any more lip from him.</p>\n<p>//</p>\n<p>\u201cSo what\u2019s the deal with you and Chloe?\u201d Jesse shouts and Beca leans in to hear him.</p>\n<p>They went to some fancy bar that the concierge recommended where the drinks are too expensive and the conversation around them too loud. There\u2019s not even any good music playing.</p>\n<p>Beca is not impressed.</p>\n<p>\u201cUh.\u201d She stalls, swirling the liquid in her glass around a little. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p>\n<p>Jesse raises his eyebrows at her. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me you guys were together?\u201d</p>\n<p>Beca bites her lip, trying to think of an answer. He\u2019s right. If she would\u2019ve told anyone, it would\u2019ve been him. She doesn\u2019t know how to say that there was actually nothing to tell.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt was all just really fast, I guess,\u201d is what she comes up with, but it sounds weak and she knows it. He\u2019s already asked where her ring is and she told him it was \u201cgetting sized\u201d and she can\u2019t believe he hasn\u2019t figured it out yet.</p>\n<p>Jesse just nods and puts his arm around her all big-brother like, which would be weird and she should hate it, but it\u2019s Jesse, so somehow it\u2019s not and she doesn\u2019t. \u201cWell, you know I love Chloe.\u201d He tilts his head to the side. \u201cI\u2019m not that surprised, really. You are guys are good together.\u201d</p>\n<p>She glances at him. \u201cUh. Thanks, I guess.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI mean, I guess I kind of always had a feeling there was something between you guys!\u201d He grins, nodding like this make sense.</p>\n<p>Which it obviously <em>does not</em>.</p>\n<p>\u201cReally?\u201d This is quickly becoming the weirdest conversation she\u2019s ever had. It doesn\u2019t help that they\u2019re practically shouting at each other to be heard.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, dude.\u201d Jesse pulls his arm away and faces her, looking at her with an expression that screams <em>obviously, Beca, god</em>. \u201cDo you know how many times you ditched me to hang out with her in college?\u201d</p>\n<p>Beca quirks an eyebrow, imagining her confusion spilling on the table and giving it all away. \u201cWell, that was for Bellas stuff.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo way, it was all the time.\u201d Jesse shakes his head like an overgrown puppy dog, adamant that you play with him. \u201cAnd remember when you got that internship and you wouldn\u2019t tell her.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShe was dealing with stuff,\u201d Beca defends. \u201cLike <em>graduating</em>. I didn\u2019t want to stress her out.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou mean make her mad at you?\u201d Jesse shoots her this condescending look that she hates. \u201cDude, she didn\u2019t graduate for three extra years. I\u2019m sure she could\u2019ve handled it by then.\u201d</p>\n<p>Beca rolls her eyes, feeling irrational anger beat at the back of her throat. \u201cShe didn\u2019t want to leave the Bellas.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd <em>you,</em> Becs.\u201d Jesse taps her forehead with his knuckles and she leans away, scoffing. \u201cShe didn\u2019t want to leave you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Beca grimaces. This conversation is dumb. Jesse is <em>dumb</em>. She downs the rest of her drink, feeling it settle with the growing sense of discomfort somewhere at the bottom of her stomach.</p>\n<p>She should tell Jesse to shut up. She should tell him that he doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s talking about.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhatever,\u201d she says instead. \u201cI\u2019m getting another drink.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cJust think about it!\u201d He calls as she walks back toward the bar.</p>\n<p>She pretends she doesn\u2019t hear him.</p>\n<p>//</p>\n<p>Chloe shrieks happily when she sees them, getting out of her car in the pick-up lane at LAX to meet them.</p>\n<p>She pulls Beca into a giant hug and Beca sinks into it for a second, but then she remembers her and Jesse\u2019s dumb conversation and pulls back. Chloe shoots her a look for a second, quick and fleeting, but then moves to hug Jesse. He picks her up and swings her around and Beca can\u2019t help but smile.</p>\n<p>They\u2019re nerds. Goofy, happy, dumb nerds.</p>\n<p>But they\u2019re her nerds. And she really loves them.</p>\n<p>//</p>\n<p>\u201cSo,\u201d Chloe says when they\u2019re alone, having dropped Jesse off at his apartment. \u201cI was thinking that we should get a dog.\u201d</p>\n<p>Beca chokes purely on air. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cA <em>dog</em>, Becs.\u201d Chloe glances at her before bringing her eyes back to the road. \u201cRelax, babe, I said a dog, not a snake.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe already have a dog. We have Jesse. Actually he\u2019s <em>worse</em> than a dog.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cClever.\u201d Chloe grins slightly. \u201cBut seriously, can we please get a dog?\u201d</p>\n<p>Beca leans against the door of the car so she can look at Chloe better. \u201cBut they\u2019re so much work. Why do you want a dog?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBecause.\u201d Chloe bites her lip, keeping her eyes on the road. \u201cIt was so boring with you gone. I was all alone. I thought I was going to <em>die</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>Beca rolls her eyes at the drama of it all. \u201cI was only gone for one night.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI know,\u201d Chloe whines. \u201cCan you imagine if you have to go away for more than that? I might not survive.\u201d</p>\n<p>Beca snorts. \u201cRight.\u201d</p>\n<p>Chloe glances at her again, bottom lip set in a pout. \u201cPlease, Bec. I promise I\u2019ll totes do like, almost all of the work. You can just appreciate its cuteness.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI dunno, Chloe.\u201d She has nice carpets. And a nice sound system. A just a nice place in general. And dogs are messy. Well, she thinks so anyway. Her parents never let her have pets as a child. Perks of divorce, she thinks sarcastically.</p>\n<p>\u201cPleeeeeease, Becs.\u201d Chloe bounces up and down a little in the driver\u2019s seat, her pout turned on full blast.</p>\n<p>\u201cUgh,\u201d Beca sighs. \u201cFine. Maybe.\u201d</p>\n<p>Chloe beams. \u201cYay!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d Beca points at her. \u201cI said maybe!\u201d</p>\n<p>She said maybe, dammit.</p>\n<p>//</p>\n<p>Beca caves.</p>\n<p>Chloe knew she would because Beca <em>always</em> caves. At least for her anyway.</p>\n<p>Chloe drags her to the Humane Society the next day, watching as Beca tries to keep a straight face at all the dogs wagging their tails at her on the other side of their cages.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis is stupid,\u201d Beca scoffs as they walk around a corner and another dog puts her nose to the bars of her cage when they pass. \u201cHow can anyone choose when the dogs are being all cute and sad locked up like this!\u201d</p>\n<p>Chloe just smiles knowingly. Beca is <em>such </em>a softie.</p>\n<p>\u201cI hate this,\u201d Beca mutters as a black lab puppy yaps at her. \u201cStop barking at me, runt!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBeca.\u201d Chloe hip-checks her and sticks her fingers through the holes in the cage. The puppy licks at them enthusiastically. \u201cChill.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo.\u201d Beca scowls, pulling her arms across her chest like a petulant child. \u201cThis place is evil. It\u2019s an orphanage, Chloe. You know who doesn\u2019t get adopted at the orphanage? The big kids.\u201d She glares at the black lab.</p>\n<p>Chloe bites the inside of her cheek to keep from laughing. \u201cOkay, so no puppies.\u201d She pulls her fingers away from the cage, threading them through Beca\u2019s. \u201cLet\u2019s go look at the older ones then.\u201d Beca tugs her away from the cage quickly. \u201cSorry, pup,\u201d she whispers.</p>\n<p>Beca has her eyes on this cute Australian Shepherd at the end of the row, but Chloe tugs on her wrist before they can get there, causing her to stop mid-step.</p>\n<p>\u201cOw, Chloe, what \u2013 \u201d</p>\n<p>Chloe\u2019s stopped walking and is staring into one of the cages, lips twisting in thought. She pulls her hand away from Beca and squats down.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a brown dog lying down on the floor of his enclosure, and as Chloe sticks her fingers in the cage, he stares at her with relative disinterest. She smiles at him, watching as he perks up slowly. Chloe thinks he has really cute pointy ears.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey,\u201d she coos. The dog sniffs her fingers, gently licking them. Chloe has the vague sense that she\u2019s met the dog before even though she obviously hasn\u2019t.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s clearly meant to be.</p>\n<p>\u201cBoxer,\u201d Beca reads off the information clipped to the cage. \u201cFour years old. Male. Named\u2026\u201d She snorts. \u201cPotato? Who the fuck names their dog Potato?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAww,\u201d Chloe grins at the dog. \u201cWho\u2019s a cute Potato?\u201d</p>\n<p>She can feel Beca staring at her, her eyes probably doing that half-crazed <em>what the hell, Chlo</em> thing they do sometimes. Chloe is very familiar with that look.</p>\n<p>She beams up at Beca. \u201cWe have to get him.\u201d</p>\n<p>Beca\u2019s eyes are totally doing the thing. \u201c<em>Him</em>?\u201d Beca stares at the dog. The dog looks back indifferently. \u201cHe looks grumpy.\u201d</p>\n<p>Chloe grins to herself. \u201cSo do you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHa ha very funny.\u201d She crosses her arms again. \u201cReally, though?\u201d</p>\n<p>Chloe nods, smiling down at the dog. \u201cHe\u2019s so cute.\u201d She waggles her fingers through the cage. \u201cWho\u2019s a cutie? You are!\u201d</p>\n<p>Beca\u2019s skeptical frown twists and Chloe knows she\u2019s trying not to laugh. Beca is so easy.</p>\n<p>\u201cPlease, Beca, look at him!\u201d She makes her eyes all big, fixing Beca with the cutest look in her arsenal. \u201cHe just want two awesome mommies to adopt him.\u201d</p>\n<p>She watches as Beca grits her teeth, eyes flicking back and forth between the dog and Chloe. She drops her head back with a groan.</p>\n<p>\u201cFine,\u201d Beca sighs.</p>\n<p>Chloe just grins.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy does this always happen to me?\u201d Beca mutters, but she goes to find a Humane Society employee.</p>\n<p>\u201cAh, this one,\u201d the lady says when Beca brings her back. Chloe\u2019s still squatting with her fingers in the holes of the cage. \u201cHe\u2019s been here for <em>quite</em> a bit.\u201d</p>\n<p>Chloe can\u2019t stop smiling. \u201cAh, see, Bec. We\u2019re saving him.\u201d</p>\n<p>Beca doesn\u2019t say anything, just fixes Chloe with a stare, somewhere between exasperated and fond. The lady lets Chloe into the enclosure and she holds out her hand so Potato can sniff it. At first, he stares at her indifferently, but then he gives it a lick, his long tongue sliding over Chloe\u2019s wrist.</p>\n<p>The employee takes Beca to the counter to go through all the paperwork and payment things (Chloe grins smugly, because like, Beca is totally her sugar mama) while Chloe stays with the dog.</p>\n<p>After he gets used to her, Potato leans his head up and licks her face. By the time Beca has returned, he\u2019s rolled over and Chloe is rubbing his belly.</p>\n<p>Beca eyes the dog like he\u2019s planning on biting a hole through her new jeans. Chloe doesn\u2019t care.</p>\n<p>She\u2019s in love.</p>\n<p>//</p>\n<p>Word gets out that Beca is involved in the new Wachowski movie.</p>\n<p>She suddenly gains an insane amount of followers on Twitter and a bunch of movie blogs start writing some articles about her. <em>On the Rocks\u2019</em> sales skyrocket in days.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s all very surreal.</p>\n<p>She thinks back to the kid she was in high school, perpetually angry at her parents, oversized headphones always around her neck. How many nights had she stayed home messing around on her laptop instead of going out and making friends?</p>\n<p>Now look at her.</p>\n<p>She guesses she\u2019s not quite as angry and she has a few more friends than she did then, even if she still has her nose in her laptop more often than not.</p>\n<p>She briefly wonders when she changed, but as she watches Chloe play tug-of-war with their new dog while she makes dinner, remembering Titanium and shower-acoustics, she thinks she probably knows the answer.</p>\n<p>//</p>\n<p>\u201cHeel, you dumb dog!\u201d Beca tugs on the dog\u2019s leash. \u201cHeel!\u201d</p>\n<p>Chloe rolls her eyes, taking the leash from Beca\u2019s hand. \u201cPo,\u201d she calls, her teacher-voice in full-effect. \u201cHeel!\u201d</p>\n<p>The dog immediately stops pulling.</p>\n<p>\u201cUgh,\u201d Beca scowls. \u201cHow come he only listens to you?\u201d</p>\n<p>Chloe grins at her. \u201cI\u2019m very persuasive.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOr because you feed him food from the table.\u201d</p>\n<p>Chloe gasps. \u201cI do not!\u201d Okay, maybe she does a little.</p>\n<p>Beca\u2019s eyebrows reach new heights on her forehead. \u201cLiar.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re such a hater,\u201d Chloe says, leading the dog over to an empty spot on the beach and sitting down.</p>\n<p>They\u2019d decided to take him for a walk on the dog-friendly beach because it was so nice out. Chloe glances down at her bare arms, briefly hoping they don\u2019t get burned, but it was too hot to not wear a tank top.</p>\n<p>Beca plops down next to her, ungracefully kicking up sand as she sprawls out.</p>\n<p>\u201cLay down, Po,\u201d Beca says, her voice a blunt mallet of authority. The dog is not impressed.</p>\n<p>\u201cPotato, down!\u201d Chloe stares at him and he lies down, a noise grumbling from the back of his throat in a disgruntled sigh. \u201cGood boy.\u201d She pats him on the head proudly.</p>\n<p>Beca eyes the dog warily. \u201cWhy the fuck didn\u2019t we change his name again?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBecause,\u201d Chloe says for probably the tenth time since they got Po. \u201cHe\u2019s four years old and changing it now would confuse him. Wouldn\u2019t it, Po?\u201d She scratches under his chin and he sticks his tongue out happily.</p>\n<p>Chloe takes her phone out of her bra and snaps a picture of him. She uploads it to Instagram with the caption \u2018<em>isn\u2019t he cute? Beca doesn\u2019t think so\u2026 #potato\u2019 </em></p>\n<p>When she looks up, Beca\u2019s pulled her legs up to her chest, her cheek resting on her knees, just staring at Chloe. Their eyes meet and Chloe thinks Beca\u2019s look almost gray, whether from the sunlight or from the intensity in them, she\u2019s not really sure.</p>\n<p>She\u2019s suddenly self-conscious. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p>\n<p>Beca twists her lips. \u201cNothing.\u201d Her gaze slips away from Chloe and comes to rest on the waves in front of them. \u201cI\u2019m just like, happy, or whatever.\u201d</p>\n<p>Something clicks deep inside Chloe. The same feeling she gets when she comes home to find Beca humming in the kitchen or when she hears Beca\u2019s song on the radio.</p>\n<p>Her heart patters like Po\u2019s feet on their hardwood floor, quick and delighted.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d she says, throat thick. \u201cMe, too.\u201d</p>\n<p>Beca smiles out at the waves, pretty and content, and the gong in Chloe\u2019s chest pangs harder, swelling with love.</p>\n<p>At their feet, Po rests his head on his paws with a happy snort.</p>\n<p>She lays her head on Beca\u2019s shoulder, the skin cold against her cheek. Beca leans into her, arm flexing against the sand to hold them up.</p>\n<p>Chloe\u2019s not sure exactly why, but somewhere deep inside her, she knows this moment will leave fingerprints on her life forever.</p>\n<p>//</p>\n<p>Chloe is crazy, Beca thinks, as they settle in front of Chloe\u2019s laptop on the couch in the living room. Chloe\u2019s got the dog in her lap, as if he\u2019s tiny or something (he\u2019s <em>not</em>), and she\u2019s leaning against Beca\u2019s side comfortably.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis is dumb,\u201d Beca grumbles as Chloe pulls Skype up on the screen. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t need a godmother. He\u2019s just a dog.\u201d</p>\n<p>Chloe has the audacity to look offended, her palms coming up to cover Po\u2019s ears. \u201cBeca,\u201d she chastises. \u201cWhat if something happens to us?\u201d</p>\n<p>Beca rolls her eyes. \u201cNothing is going to happen to us.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know that!\u201d Chloe takes her hands away from the dog\u2019s ears and hits call on the screen. \u201cNow quit whining and pretend we\u2019re engaged.\u201d</p>\n<p>Beca scoffs before fixing her face in the most outrageously sarcastic interpretation of a loving smile that she can muster. \u201cYes, dear.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShut up,\u201d Chloe giggles, but at that moment, their Skype call is answered and Beca\u2019s stomach drops.</p>\n<p>She and Aubrey mostly worked their beef out over the past six years, but seeing her still causes Beca to shudder slightly.</p>\n<p>She\u2019ll never forget all that awful cardio.</p>\n<p>\u201cAubrey!\u201d Chloe\u2019s suddenly all smiles and excitement at seeing her best friend. Beca pretends that doesn\u2019t make her soften a little because she\u2019s still kind of grumpy that Chloe is making her do this.</p>\n<p>Chloe makes her do a lot of things she doesn\u2019t want to do. Beca thinks it must be akin to a superpower or something.</p>\n<p>\u201cChloe!\u201d Aubrey beams at them from the laptop. \u201cOh my God, is that him?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAubrey, this is Po! Po, this is Aubrey!\u201d Chloe holds up the dog\u2019s paw in a wave. He looks at Beca, unimpressed. She shrugs at him sympathetically. She totally feels the dude.</p>\n<p>\u201cAww,\u201d Aubrey coos. Beca\u2019s starting to feel extremely nauseous at the whole ordeal. \u201cHi, Po. And hello, Beca.\u201d</p>\n<p>Beca nods her head. \u201c\u2019Sup, Aubrey.\u201d</p>\n<p>Aubrey leans closer to the camera, her eyes narrowing. \u201cBeca, are you sunburned? You know I\u2019ve told you about the hazards of not wearing sunblock.\u201d</p>\n<p>Beca\u2019s hand covers her nose self-consciously. \u201cNo, I just.\u201d She tries to think of a clever response, but not seeing Aubrey in a few years has her really out of practice. She scowls instead.</p>\n<p>Chloe just beams between them. Beca finds the whole thing a mix of adorable and disgusting.</p>\n<p>\u201cAubrey, Beca and I have something to ask you.\u201d Chloe jiggles her leg nervously. Beca rolls her eyes. Chloe is such a drama queen.</p>\n<p>Aubrey raises her eyebrows in anticipation. \u201cOh, you do, do you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d Chloe nods, fixing Beca with an expectant look.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Beca stares back, an uncomfortable feeling of dread rising in her lungs.</p>\n<p>Chloe jerks her head toward Aubrey, a mischievous twinkle in her eye. Beca freezes. Chloe is crazy, she thinks again. Chloe is crazy if she think that Beca is going to \u2013</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, ask her.\u201d Chloe nudges her.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat, no!\u201d Beca shakes her head. \u201cYou ask her!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Beca</em>,\u201d Chloe commands with her teacher voice, the voice that drives Po to sit when he\u2019s begging at the table.</p>\n<p>Beca falters. \u201cI. What? Chloe. <em>No</em>.\u201d Chloe continues to stare at her. \u201cI. Ugh... Fine. Aubrey,\u201d she starts. Chloe nods encouragingly at her, all sunshine and daisies. Beca hates everything about this moment. \u201cWill you like, be Po\u2019s extremely unnecessary godmother, or whatever?\u201d</p>\n<p>Aubrey gasps excitedly. Chloe beams with the force of a spotlight. Beca hates everything.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh my God! Of course I will!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGreat,\u201d Beca intones wryly.</p>\n<p>Chloe rolls her eyes at Beca, her body buzzing happily. \u201cDon\u2019t mind her. But yay, this is so exciting! Isn\u2019t it Po,\u201d she says in her puppy-voice, shaking his paw up and down. \u201cAuntie Aubrey loves you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Aubrey\u2019s laugh fizzes through the speakers as she smiles at Chloe like she could cure cancer. Somehow, Beca understands the feeling.</p>\n<p>\u201cI have something to tell you guys, too.\u201d Aubrey taps her fingers against her wrist, a nervous habit Beca recognizes from when they were in Bellas together. She\u2019s suddenly intrigued. Maybe Aubrey is pregnant. What if she\u2019s a stripper? Oh my God. What if she\u2019s dating a Treble? The possibilities are endless.</p>\n<p>\u201cI might be moving to Los Angeles!\u201d Aubrey bursts out. Chloe gasps again. Beca deflates.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat!\u201d Chloe shrieks. \u201cWhy? When?\u201d</p>\n<p>Aubrey crosses her hands on the desk in front of her, leaning in slightly. \u201cWell, my father\u2019s decided that it\u2019s an opportune time to expand his firm to have locations in L.A. and New York and\u2026\u201d She grins widely at them. \u201cHe\u2019s sending <em>me</em> to headline the Los Angeles one!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh my God!\u201d Beca\u2019s going to go deaf in one ear if Chloe doesn\u2019t stop screaming. \u201cThat\u2019s amazing, congratulations!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, dude.\u201d Beca agrees. She\u2019s happy for Aubrey, at least. Finally her dad has stopped being such a dick. \u201cCongrats.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThanks guys.\u201d Aubrey looks like she might get teary-eyed. Beca has never felt more uncomfortable. And that\u2019s saying something. Jesse made her watch <em>The Brood</em> once.</p>\n<p>Chloe claps her hands excitedly. \u201cWhen are you coming?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, I was thinking that\u2026\u201d Aubrey clears her throat. \u201cThat I could live with you guys?\u201d</p>\n<p>Beca\u2019s pretty sure her heart stops beating right then and there. \u201cLive.. live with\u2026 <em>live with us?</em>\u201d she splutters. Oh no. Oh nooooo. No.</p>\n<p>This is her space. Her calm, serene, no psychotic-ex-college-a capella-group-sister-infiltrated <em>space</em>.</p>\n<p>Suddenly, Aubrey barks out a laugh. Po perks up his ears at the sound. \u201cRelax, Beca. I\u2019m kidding.\u201d</p>\n<p>Beca stares, feeling her suddenly chilled blood start to return to its normal temperature. Chloe squeezes her knee, chuckling.</p>\n<p>\u201cNot cool, dude,\u201d she mumbles.</p>\n<p>Aubrey smirks, all too familiar and biting. \u201cI should be offended by the terror that passed over your face, but I\u2019ll let it slide. I wouldn\u2019t want to invade your\u2026\u201d she crinkles her nose as if Po had breathed puppy-breath in her face. \u201cPre-marriage den.\u201d</p>\n<p>Beca freezes, eyes wide. She\u2019d almost forgotten they were supposed to be pretending to be engaged.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, thank you, Aubrey,\u201d Chloe grins gratefully, clearly covering for Beca\u2019s inability to make proper words with her mouth.</p>\n<p>Aubrey just winks at Chloe. \u201cAnyway, Chlo. I was going to come out over Thanksgiving to look for a place. Then I\u2019ll probably move out after New Years.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGreat!\u201d Chloe\u2019s smile reaches her ears. \u201cYou can join us for Thanksgiving, then! Emily and Benji will be here! And I think Jesse was planning on coming, too.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWonderful!\u201d</p>\n<p>Yes, Beca thinks as they say their goodbyes. Just wonderful.</p>\n<p>//</p>\n<p>Chloe\u2019s always known that if it\u2019s between her and Beca, she\u2019s the dramatic one. Aubrey always told her she needs to think before she overreacts, and while she\u2019s gotten better at it, she knows she\u2019s not immune yet.</p>\n<p>That\u2019s why she\u2019s totally surprised when it\u2019s who Beca starts screaming at Lindsey over the phone just a few days before Thanksgiving.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou are supposed to be handling these things! That\u2019s your job, Lindsey!\u201d</p>\n<p>Well, she thinks. Beca did punch someone and go to jail once\u2026</p>\n<p>Chloe purses her lips, an awkward feeling of discomfort rising in her stomach, and stares at the reason for Beca\u2019s continued yelling: an article pulled up on Chloe\u2019s laptop.</p>\n<p>The article itself is extremely mild, which is why Chloe\u2019s surprised at Beca\u2019s outbursts. Chloe would hardly even call it an article, more like a short blurb with a couple of pictures.</p>\n<p>But Chloe guesses it\u2019s the pictures that are the problem.</p>\n<p>The first picture was clearly taken by the paparazzi, a candid snapshot of her and Beca walking Po along the beach. Beca\u2019s in a tank top and jean shorts and Chloe\u2019s got her bikini on under a sundress. Beca\u2019s shooting her a smile, Chloe can\u2019t remember why, but she\u2019s laughing at whatever Beca just said.</p>\n<p>The caption reads \u201con-the-rise producer/artist Beca Mitchell and her stunning fianc\u00e9e, Chloe Beale, walk their dog Potato on a sunny Friday outing.\u201d</p>\n<p>Under the caption is another picture, one taken from Chloe\u2019s Instagram featuring the dog licking Beca\u2019s face with the caption \u201c<em>He loves Beca\u2026 that makes two of us! #potato\u201d</em> that she posted a few days ago.</p>\n<p>Chloe doesn\u2019t really mind. Sure, it\u2019s weird seeing her face online like this, and it\u2019s weirder that they used her own picture, but the photos are harmless.</p>\n<p>If anything, it should be a compliment. Beca is clearly growing enough in fame that the paparazzi took an interest in their dog-walk.</p>\n<p>Plus, they called Chloe stunning.</p>\n<p>Which like, duh.</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t care!\u201d Beca huffs out from the other room. \u201cI don\u2019t want them messing with Chloe. We need to call it off, now!\u201d</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a silence and Chloe distractedly twists the engagement ring Lindsey had sent over the other day around her finger.</p>\n<p>(\u201cTo keep up appearances,\u201d Lindsey had said to Beca over the phone.</p>\n<p>\u201cThese aren\u2019t real, are they?\u201d Beca eyed her own ring warily. Chloe thought they looked pretty.</p>\n<p>Lindsey just ignored her. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it.\u201d)</p>\n<p>Chloe sighs as Beca starts shouting again. \u201cI don\u2019t care if Marcus suddenly admits that he\u2019s into shoving Legos up his ass!\u201d Chloe\u2019s eyebrows shoot up her forehead. \u201cThis has nothing to do with me!\u201d</p>\n<p>Silence. Chloe scrolls down the article again.</p>\n<p>\u201cFine!\u201d Beca\u2019s voice stabs the air like a knife. Chloe feels mildly bad for Lindsey. \u201cBut I deserve a bonus for this.\u201d</p>\n<p>Seconds later, Beca storms back into the kitchen, sitting down with a dramatic huff. Chloe smiles at her sympathetically.</p>\n<p>\u201cApparently Marcus just got a DUI so the label is trying to deal with that PR shitstorm,\u201d Beca grumbles, her chin coming to rest on her enclosed fist in defeat. \u201cLindsey says we can\u2019t issue the statement that we\u2019re not together until it all blows over.\u201d</p>\n<p>Chloe\u2019s not sure why, but something in her chest pangs with relief.</p>\n<p>They <em>did </em>just get these pretty rings.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be okay, Becs.\u201d Chloe grabs Beca\u2019s free hand, tangling their fingers together. She rubs her thumb over Beca\u2019s.</p>\n<p>\u201cI know it\u2019ll be okay,\u201d Beca mutters. \u201cIt just sucks that you\u2019re getting dragged into this. At least I knew what I was getting into when I put that album out.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHey,\u201d Chloe pouts. \u201cYou\u2019re my best friend. We\u2019re in this together.\u201d Chloe quirks an eyebrow playfully. \u201cPlus, it\u2019s not <em>all</em> bad. They did call me stunning.\u201d</p>\n<p>Beca snorts. \u201cThat\u2019s because you are.\u201d</p>\n<p>Chloe takes a secret pleasure in the way Beca\u2019s ears turn bright red, but doesn\u2019t comment on it. She squeezes Beca\u2019s hand and lets go, immediately missing the coolness of Beca\u2019s fingers between her own.</p>\n<p>\u201cCome on,\u201d Chloe says, standing up and holding her hands out to help Beca up.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhere are we going?\u201d Beca asks, but takes Chloe\u2019s hands anyway.</p>\n<p>\u201cIn-N-Out,\u201d Chloe replies. \u201cSo I can buy my fianc\u00e9e a milkshake.\u201d</p>\n<p>Beca rolls her eyes, but she grins in a way that makes Chloe\u2019s heart jump-start, and Chloe knows what she said was true.</p>\n<p>They\u2019re in this together. They\u2019ll figure it out.</p>\n<p>//</p>\n<p>Beca picks Emily and Benji up from the airport the day before Thanksgiving. Chloe was going to come too, but at the last minute she started stressing out about making their place look so clean that it\u2019s like they don\u2019t even live there.</p>\n<p>Beca tried to reason with her when she started scrubbing the hard-wood floor on her hands and knees, but Chloe on a mission is not to be stopped.</p>\n<p>Emily talks her ear off the whole drive back from LAX, but she doesn\u2019t mind. She makes eye contact with Benji in the rearview mirror and he smiles knowingly at her. She guesses he doesn\u2019t mind, either.</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay, so,\u201d Emily gushes and Beca just lifts an eyebrow in her direction, eyes still on the road. \u201cI\u2019ve been working on a bunch of new stuff, and I know we only have three days, two if you include Thanksgiving, because you probably don\u2019t really want to work on Thanksgiving. Especially if you\u2019re cooking and stuff and my mom and I always watch the parade if you\u2019re into that, which I don\u2019t know about you, but Chloe seems like she might be\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>Beca bites back a grin and waits for Emily to get to the point.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnyway. I have a bunch of new stuff and I really can\u2019t wait for you to hear it and I was hoping that I could come back for Spring Break and we could finally finish making a full demo. But like, only if that\u2019s okay with you Bec. I know you\u2019re so busy with your movie and your own music and the wedding and everything. I\u2019m just <em>so</em> excited. Especially now that I\u2019m about to graduate, you know? Well you probably know, I mean you already graduated.\u201d</p>\n<p>Emily takes a breath like she might continue so Beca takes one hand off the steering wheel and covers Emily\u2019s mouth with it. Emily\u2019s eyes grow to baseball size. Beca feels her exhale against her hand and pulls it away.</p>\n<p>\u201cBreathe, Legacy.\u201d</p>\n<p>Emily nods. \u201cI\u2019m breathing. Totally breathing.\u201d</p>\n<p>Beca smirks. \u201cWe can definitely look at the stuff you\u2019ve been working on. I\u2019m not doing anything work-related until next week.\u201d</p>\n<p>Emily beams excitedly and Beca feels that soft feeling of fondness ease over her. Emily reminds her of Chloe so much sometimes.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat about you, Benji, you got some stuff I need to look at?\u201d Beca peers back in the rearview mirror again. Benji just grins.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m just a computer science nerd now, actually. Except at karaoke night.\u201d</p>\n<p>Emily nods enthusiastically. \u201cHe\u2019s so smart. You should see some of the stuff he\u2019s doing with codes and interfaces and stuff. I look at it and I\u2019m just like, sheesh, Benj. He could be hacking the Pentagon for all I know.\u201d</p>\n<p>Benji chuckles. \u201cI\u2019ve told you a million times, Em. I\u2019m not hacking the Pentagon.\u201d</p>\n<p>She doesn\u2019t look convinced. \u201cI\u2019m just saying that I wouldn\u2019t <em>know</em> whether or not you were\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>At that point, Beca pulls into the driveway, letting out a sigh of relief. Not that she doesn\u2019t love her, but Emily doesn\u2019t appreciate the beauty of silence as much as Beca does.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo,\u201d Beca says as they walk through the door. \u201cEmily you know where everything is if you want to show Benij around. I\u2019m just going to go\u2026 pee, or whatever.\u201d Really she just needs one second of quiet to psych herself up for the next few days.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou got it, Captain!\u201d Emily salutes dorkily and pulls Benji down the hall and into Chloe\u2019s room. Or. <em>The guest room</em>, Beca reminds herself, thinking of their frenzy that morning to move all of Chloe\u2019s stuff into Beca\u2019s room for the next couple of days.</p>\n<p>This fake-engagement thing is getting really inconvenient and if it was with anyone other than Chloe, Beca is one hundred percent sure she would\u2019ve sacrificed her stupid image after like, two days.</p>\n<p>She walks into her room \u2013 <em>their room</em>, she corrects in her head \u2013 to find Chloe laying on the bed, watching <em>Grey\u2019s Anatomy</em> reruns on TV. Po\u2019s laying on his bed in the corner, fast asleep.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey,\u201d Chloe grins when she sees Beca. \u201cHow\u2019d it go? Where\u2019s Emily and Benji?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGetting settled.\u201d Beca groans. \u201cI love them, but I have a feeling this is going to be a long three days.\u201d</p>\n<p>Chloe pouts, opening her arms. Beca rolls her eyes, but crawls into bed next to her and lays her head on Chloe\u2019s chest. She closes her eyes as Chloe rubs her back gently.</p>\n<p>\u201cAt least Aubrey isn\u2019t here yet?\u201d She can feel Chloe\u2019s smile in her hair and Beca can\u2019t help the small chuckle that escapes her mouth.</p>\n<p>\u201cThank the aca-gods for that.\u201d</p>\n<p>Chloe laughs and it washes over Beca like a warm blanket. She feels the stress start to leave her shoulders.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s just three days,\u201d Beca says, trying to convince herself.</p>\n<p>\u201cJust three days,\u201d Chloe repeats, and Beca doesn\u2019t need much more convincing than that.</p>\n<p>//</p>\n<p>The next day is probably the most hectic day of Beca\u2019s life.</p>\n<p>Including that day Fat Amy flashed President Obama. She shudders at the memory.</p>\n<p>She\u2019s been in the kitchen since she practically woke up, peeling potatoes and trying to prep the turkey, which, like, thank god for Google.</p>\n<p>If anyone had told her two years ago that she\u2019d be \u201cengaged\u201d to Chloe Beale and cooking Thanksgiving dinner for their friends pretty much by herself, she would have laughed in their face.</p>\n<p>Now look at her.</p>\n<p>Those aca-gods sure do have a sense of humor.</p>\n<p>Somewhere in the other room, Emily is laughing at some joke that Jesse just made. She hears Aubrey\u2019s sharp reply and briefly is grateful she doesn\u2019t have to deal with <em>that</em>.</p>\n<p>She <em>is</em> happy that Aubrey\u2019s here, though. Chloe teared up a little when Aubrey arrived and Beca knows she\u2019s missed her. They\u2019ve been catching up for the past hour and Beca\u2019s been glad to let them have their time together alone. Even if it means she\u2019s doing all this cooking.</p>\n<p>The timer on the oven goes off and Beca checks the temperature of the turkey. Almost done. She sighs in relief.</p>\n<p>She goes back to peeling the potatoes, absentmindedly humming to the song she and Emily put together last night. It sounds great and Beca feels pride swell in her chest.</p>\n<p>Ugh, she is turning into <em>such </em>a sap. <em>Gross</em>.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhatcha smiling about?\u201d</p>\n<p>Beca jumps, the peeler slipping from her hand and into the sink with a metallic clang.</p>\n<p>\u201cOops, sorry,\u201d Chloe appears next to her and Beca\u2019s heart takes flight. She drops her chin to her chest as she starts to laugh.</p>\n<p>\u201cDude! I hate when you do that.\u201d</p>\n<p>Chloe hugs her from behind, her chin resting on Beca\u2019s shoulder. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to,\u201d she giggles in Beca\u2019s ear.</p>\n<p>Beca relaxes into the hug as her heart returns to normal speed. She picks up the peeler and the potato she was working on. \u201cYou\u2019re going to give me a heart attack one of these days.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMmm.\u201d Chloe hums and they lapse into a brief silence that\u2019s only broken by the clicking of the peeler. Eventually, Chloe lets go of her and takes the peeler and the potato from her hands, hip-checking her away from the sink.</p>\n<p>Beca turns to check on the turkey again and sees Jesse leaning against the doorway of the kitchen wearing a shit-eating grin.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat,\u201d she scowls at him.</p>\n<p>\u201cNothing,\u201d he says innocently. \u201cCan I help with anything?\u201d</p>\n<p>Beca narrows her eyes at him. \u201cYou can set the table.\u201d She juts her chin at the plates and utensils on the island.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou got it, Boss.\u201d He winks and grabs the plates, heading into the other room to set the table.</p>\n<p>She stares after him suspiciously.</p>\n<p>Stupid Jesse.</p>\n<p>//</p>\n<p>It\u2019s Chloe\u2019s first Thanksgiving away from her parents and it\u2019s different in all of the best ways.</p>\n<p>She didn\u2019t have to dress up super fancy, but opted for a casual blue dress that brings out the blue in her eyes and accentuates the tan on her arms that she gained since moving to L.A.</p>\n<p>Back home, Chloe\u2019s mom usually puts her on green-bean casserole duty, which is unfortunate because Chloe hates green-bean casserole. When Chloe asks Beca what she should be helping with, Beca just shrugs and tells her to go catch up with Aubrey. She knows it\u2019s because Beca is secretly afraid Chloe will probably burn something with her culinary ineptitude, but still, she\u2019s grateful.</p>\n<p>Aubrey tells her all about her newest case and Chloe catches her up on what she\u2019s having her kids sing at their Christmas concert. She feels her cheeks starting to hurt from smiling too much, but she can\u2019t stop. She\u2019s missed Aubrey a lot and this is probably the best Thanksgiving she\u2019s ever had.</p>\n<p>When Jesse starts telling Aubrey about the movie that he and Beca are working on, she excuses herself to help Beca in the kitchen.</p>\n<p>Beca\u2019s peeling potatoes, the muscles in her arms flexing with every stroke, and humming under her breath. She\u2019s wearing this old pair of jean shorts, frayed at the bottoms, and this soft navy shirt that hangs loosely around her stomach. Her hair falls over one shoulder, piercings on full display, and as Chloe watches, a small smile tugs at her lips.</p>\n<p>She looks so pretty and so <em>Beca</em> in that moment that Chloe feels love rush through her, and she scoops Beca up in a hug, pleased when Beca doesn\u2019t pull away.</p>\n<p>Chloe thinks she likes Thanksgiving with Beca a lot more than she likes it with her parents.</p>\n<p>//</p>\n<p>The table is meant for four people, but the six of them manage to squeeze around it easily enough. As she passes the gravy to Emily on her right, Chloe can\u2019t help but think that she wishes Thanksgiving could always be like this.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis turkey is amazing, Becs,\u201d she says, smiling at Beca on her left. Beca just shrugs and Chloe grins at her inability to take a compliment.</p>\n<p>The rest of the table hums in agreement.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhere\u2019d you learn to cook, Beca?\u201d Aubrey fixes Beca with a curious stare and Beca twists her lips in thought.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, you know.\u201d She shrugs again and passes Chloe a dinner roll. \u201cPerks of being a child of divorce. You get tired of pizza after a while.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jesse looks scandalized at the thought of getting tired of pizza. \u201cNo way. Never.\u201d</p>\n<p>Beca crinkles her nose. \u201cDivorce is another monster, dude.\u201d</p>\n<p>Chloe holds her breath, waiting for bitterness to seep into Beca\u2019s expression, but it never does. Beca catches her eye and pours her some wine.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p>\n<p>Chloe just shakes her head and exhales. Beca raises an eyebrow and does that half-grin Chloe loves. \u201cNothing.\u201d</p>\n<p>They make light conversation about Benji\u2019s job and Emily\u2019s classes. Chloe feels Po squirm his way under the table, plopping down on her feet with a low snort.</p>\n<p>Aubrey starts chastising Beca about her cholesterol (\u201cI\u2019m not a fifty-year old man, Aubrey.\u201d \u201cHigh cholesterol effects women, too, <em>Beca.</em>\u201d), and Chloe drifts into a sleepy daze right there at the table.</p>\n<p>When Beca shifts next to her, her leg coming to rest against Chloe\u2019s, Chloe feels heat rush through her body, not sure if it\u2019s from Beca or the glasses of wine she\u2019d had.</p>\n<p>Either way, Beca smiles at her, and Chloe grins back, wine-drunk and happy.</p>\n<p>//</p>\n<p>Emily and Benji offer to the dishes, so Beca stretches out on the couch, Chloe\u2019s head in her lap. Aubrey left a little while after dinner and Chloe quickly dropped off into a light sleep as soon as Beca\u2019s fingers started tapping a rhythm on her forehead. Jesse\u2019s sitting on the floor and scrolling through the channels on the TV for a good movie.</p>\n<p>He clicks on something and grins at her. \u201c<em>Clueless</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>Beca just shrugs and shakes her head.\u00a0 He really should be used to this by now.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re the worst, actually,\u201d he says, moving to lean his back against the middle of the couch.</p>\n<p>Beca snorts. \u201cYep.\u201d</p>\n<p>They watch the movie in silence for a few minutes. Or at least Jesse does. Beca rubs her pointer finger up and down Chloe\u2019s forehead, enjoying the way Chloe\u2019s nose wrinkles in her sleep when Beca accidentally tickles her.</p>\n<p>\u201cDude,\u201d Jesse says eventually. \u201cYou are so whipped.\u201d</p>\n<p>Beca\u2019s eyes shoot up. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou know,\u201d he says, making a whipping-motion. \u201cWhipped?\u201d</p>\n<p>Beca scowls. \u201cGross. No I\u2019m not.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jesse shrugs knowingly and Beca wants to punch that condescending look off his face. \u201cYou never used to do that shit with me. And we dated for three years.\u201d</p>\n<p>Beca opens her mouth to argue, but then thinks better of it. She wants to tell Jesse he\u2019s stupid and wrong, but she can\u2019t. She\u2019s supposed to be engaged.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhatever,\u201d she says instead.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he smirks. \u201cWhatever.\u201d</p>\n<p>She grits her teeth and glares at him until he returns his attention to the movie. She goes back to dragging her finger across Chloe\u2019s forehead.</p>\n<p>Stupid Jesse. He doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s talking about.</p>\n<p>//</p>\n<p>Chloe\u2019s drooling. That\u2019s her first thought when she wakes up.</p>\n<p>Her second thought is that she\u2019s drooling <em>on someone</em>, her cheek pressed warm into a collarbone.</p>\n<p>Her third thought is that the <em>someone</em> is murmuring quietly, talking on the phone, and playing with Chloe\u2019s hair.</p>\n<p>Her fourth thought is that it\u2019s Beca.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, I guess that\u2019s fine.\u201d Chloe feels the words vibrate around Beca\u2019s chest and into the air. \u201cNo, no. I\u2019m excited. Swear.\u201d</p>\n<p>Chloe hears the sound of someone responding, but can\u2019t make out the words.</p>\n<p>\u201cSorry,\u201d Beca says. Her fingers still on Chloe\u2019s neck as Beca freezes. After a second, they go back to tugging through Chloe\u2019s hair gently. She feels Beca exhale.</p>\n<p>\u201cNot. It\u2019s\u2026 I\u2019m just,\u201d Beca stutters. \u201cNo, Chloe\u2019s just sleeping.\u201d More response from whoever is on the phone. Beca snorts. \u201cFuck you, Linds.\u201d</p>\n<p>Chloe grins into Beca\u2019s chest.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m hanging up now.\u201d</p>\n<p>Chloe feels Beca set her phone on the nightstand and sink back into her pillow with a huff. She flutters her eyes open.</p>\n<p>\u201cWas that Lindsey?\u201d Her voice is croaky with sleep and she clears her throat.</p>\n<p>Beca shifts. \u201cCrap, did I wake you up?\u201d</p>\n<p>Chloe shakes her head. \u201cWhat did Lindsey have to say so early in the morning?\u201d</p>\n<p>She feels Beca chuckle. \u201cIt\u2019s noon, Chlo.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIs it really?\u201d She lifts her head and glances at the clock. \u201cOh, wow.\u201d Beca raises her eyebrows in amusement. Chloe slumps back down on her chest.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhatever,\u201d Beca says. \u201cIt\u2019s a holiday.\u201d</p>\n<p>Chloe hums in agreement and adjusts her position so she\u2019s more on her side and can look up at Beca. \u201cSo\u2026?\u201d</p>\n<p>Beca rolls her eyes. \u201cCuriosity killed the cat, you know.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m more of a dog person.\u201d As if to back her up from across the room, Po lets out a deep yawn that ends in a groan.</p>\n<p>She feels Beca laugh. \u201cApparently.\u201d She taps her fingers on Chloe\u2019s back. \u201cI have to go back to New York for a week.\u201d</p>\n<p>Chloe pinches her eyebrows together. \u201cWhen?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFew days before Christmas.\u201d She sighs. \u201cJesse and I have laid the foundation for the overall sound of the movie so we have to meet up with sound team and go over some stuff.\u201d She shrugs. \u201cBoring stuff.\u201d</p>\n<p>Chloe twists her lips. \u201cBecs, that\u2019s not boring. That\u2019s really cool.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Beca avoids her eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d She shrugs. \u201cI won\u2019t be back until Christmas Eve though, and you\u2019re going home for Christmas so\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>Chloe feels a rush of fondness as she suddenly gets it. \u201cBeca Mitchell, are you trying to say you\u2019ll miss me?\u201d Beca\u2019s face turns bright red. Chloe grins and pokes her cheek. Beca turns her face away embarrassed. Chloe wants to die, it\u2019s so cute. \u201cAww. I\u2019ll miss you, too.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUgh, stop.\u201d Beca tries to be serious, but it bleeds into a laugh. Chloe pokes her cheek again. \u201cStop it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re so cute.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI hate you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Chloe shakes her head. \u201cYou love me. It\u2019s fine. Just admit it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhatever,\u201d Beca drawls. She raises her eyebrows like she knows something Chloe doesn\u2019t. \u201cIf you miss me too much, you can just watch me on TV.\u201d</p>\n<p>Chloe feels her nose crinkle in confusion. \u201cOn TV?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Beca says, all casual and indifferent. Chloe is suddenly suspicious. \u201cDecember 22<sup>nd</sup> on Late Night with Seth Meyers.\u201d</p>\n<p>Chloe\u2019s mouth falls open. \u201cWhat? Are you serious?\u201d</p>\n<p>Beca nods, lips revealing a toothy grin that pulls at Chloe\u2019s heart. \u201cYeah. I\u2019m serious.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh my God!\u201d Chloe shoots up, excitement pumping through her. \u201cOh my God oh my God!\u201d</p>\n<p>Beca smiles fully, reveling in Chloe\u2019s enthusiasm. \u201cI know right.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBeca!\u201d Chloe rolls over, effectively sitting on Beca. She takes Beca\u2019s cheeks between her palms and squeezes them. \u201cOh my God!\u201d</p>\n<p>Beca\u2019s body shakes as she laughs. \u201cStop saying that. And get off me!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo!\u201d Chloe can\u2019t stop smiling. She pulls her hands away from Beca\u2019s face. \u201cExplain!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t really know?\u201d Beca shrugs as much as she can while lying down with Chloe on top of her. \u201cLindsey just called and said that since I was going to be in New York anyway, she\u2019d try to make it happen. And then she did?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh my God,\u201d Chloe says again. She doesn\u2019t really have any other words right now.</p>\n<p>Beca nods like she understands. Her hands come up to tap on Chloe\u2019s thighs. \u201cI can\u2019t believe it either. Like why would they want to hear me talk? I\u2019m not funny or interesting or anything.\u201d</p>\n<p>Chloe looks at Beca like she\u2019s crazy. \u201cAre you serious? Beca, you\u2019re the most interesting and talented person I\u2019ve ever met.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI..\u201d Beca falters, her cheeks turning red again. \u201cOkay?\u201d</p>\n<p>Chloe grabs her face again. \u201cI\u2019m serious.\u201d</p>\n<p>Beca purses her lips. \u201cOkay. Thanks?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Chloe stares down at her, hoping Beca <em>gets</em> it. How could she not? She\u2019s so smart and funny, and her music clearly shows how talented she is. And like, she\u2019s so pretty that it makes Chloe dizzy sometimes.</p>\n<p>Beca meets her eyes and Chloe\u2019s stomach drops. Her breath gets caught in her throat. She shifts slightly and suddenly becomes hyperaware that she\u2019s practically straddling Beca in just her sleep shorts and low rise tank top. She tries to not notice how Beca\u2019s eyes keep glancing down at her cleavage.</p>\n<p>\u201cUmm,\u201d Chloe clears her throat. \u201cI\u2019m gonna get off now.\u201d</p>\n<p>Beca snorts. \u201cGood for you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShut up.\u201d Chloe grins and pushes at Beca playfully before sliding off of her, her feet hitting the floor with a light thud. Po raises his head at the noise. She pats it briefly and heads toward the bathroom. She closes the door behind her, leaning her back against it and taking a deep breath.</p>\n<p>She glances at her reflection in the mirror above the sink. Her cheeks flush crimson and her eyes look extra blue under the bright bathroom lights.</p>\n<p>She exhales shakily and bites her lip, realization flooding through her. She tries to shake it off, but she\u2019s always been in-tune with her feelings. There\u2019s no denying it.</p>\n<p>She\u2019s totally into Beca Mitchell.</p>\n<p>//</p>\n<p>Chloe\u2019s always been one to act on her feelings. She doesn\u2019t know how not to. Once she feels something, she can\u2019t just <em>not</em> feel it, so why pretend she doesn\u2019t?</p>\n<p>The problem is, Beca is the opposite. Chloe doesn\u2019t want to say Beca is obtuse, but Beca is clearly not as into recognizing feelings as Chloe is. Chloe guesses it\u2019s from the years Beca spent trying not to add her problems to those of her parents, clamping them down and willing them to go away in hopes that by pretending <em>she\u2019s </em>okay, then her parents will be okay, too.</p>\n<p>But then again, Chloe studied literature and education, not psychology, so she can\u2019t say for sure.</p>\n<p>Still, she\u2019s aware that it takes Beca light-years to realize what she\u2019s feeling, especially if you call her out on it.</p>\n<p>Which is why Chloe tries not to do that with Beca. It\u2019s kind of weird, because with anyone else, Chloe just says what she\u2019s thinking. Not that she doesn\u2019t do that with Beca, but when it comes to some things, Chloe finds herself being a little withholding. She doesn\u2019t even mean to be. It just happens.</p>\n<p>The only thing is that even when Chloe is keeping these things to herself, Chloe is <em>very</em> aware of what she\u2019s feeling, and once she realizes she\u2019s feeling something, she feels and feels and feels until she can\u2019t stop thinking about it. She <em>obsesses</em>.</p>\n<p>And after her little revelation in the bathroom, Chloe\u2019s a little frustrated with her one-track mind.</p>\n<p>Because she can\u2019t stop thinking about Beca.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s been a day. Not even. She hasn\u2019t even slept on it yet, but still, here she is, staring at Beca like she\u2019s under hypnosis.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s like she\u2019s never even <em>seen</em> Beca before.</p>\n<p>She watches as Beca gives Emily a thumbs-up, her fingers pushing at the switches on the table in front of her, cueing up the music. Emily bops her head and starts to sing, hands pushing at the large headphones around her ears, but Chloe hardly notices the song at all.</p>\n<p>Beca is tapping her fingers against her arm, one finger hovering over a dial on the board in front of her, her face twisted in concentration. Chloe\u2019s eyes follow the path of her fingers, up her arm and to her face. She just looks so pretty, and so <em>Beca</em>, and Chloe\u2019s chest feels airy like there\u2019s helium in her heart, tugging it up, up, and away.</p>\n<p>Benji grins at her and Chloe wonders if he <em>knows</em>.</p>\n<p>She smiles back at him and he quickly goes back to watching Emily sing, shooting her the biggest heart-eyes she\u2019s ever seen.</p>\n<p>She totally understands.</p>\n<p>As Beca smiles that sharp half-grin Chloe loves, she thinks her eyes probably look the same.</p>\n<p>//</p>\n<p>Beca hates tears.</p>\n<p>She hates them so much. When people cry, she feels so uncomfortable and out of her element. She wasn\u2019t made for this whole comforting thing.</p>\n<p>Crying girls are her weakness. Avoiding a crying Chloe Beale is her first priority.</p>\n<p>Avoiding a crying Emily Junk is quickly becoming her second.</p>\n<p>\u201cThere, there,\u201d Beca says and cringes. Why did she say that? Nobody actually says that. She pats the girl on the shoulder as if that\u2019ll make the tears building in her eyes go away.</p>\n<p>\u201cSorry,\u201d Emily says, wiping her nose as she sniffles a little. \u201cI\u2019m just going to miss you guys. And with Nationals coming up and the team not ready, I just feel really out of my element. I\u2019m like the worst captain ever, we haven\u2019t won since you guys left and this is my last chance and I just feel like I\u2019m tarnishing the Bellas name and \u2013 \u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhoa, okay, stop. Just stop.\u201d Beca grabs the girl by her biceps and shakes her a little. Just a little. \u201cBreathe, Legacy.\u201d</p>\n<p>Emily nods quickly and inhales. Beca sighs. This has been the weirdest two days. First, Chloe\u2019s been acting so weird and she can\u2019t figure out why. Like, usually she won\u2019t stop <em>touching</em> Beca, but she\u2019s been strangely distant. Like, she didn\u2019t even cuddle up to Beca last night, which in the past would\u2019ve relieved her probably, but now she\u2019s used to it and she even kind of <em>missed</em> it.</p>\n<p>Not that she\u2019d admit that, but, you know. <em>Whatever</em>.</p>\n<p>So if that wasn\u2019t weird enough, now she\u2019s just trying to drop Emily and Benji off at the airport and all of a sudden, Emily \u2013 optimistic grab-life-by-the-horns Emily \u2013 whips out the water works right there in the drop-off lane.</p>\n<p>Beca has the strange sensation that she\u2019s landed in an alternate dimension. Except the part where she\u2019s awkward because that\u2019s apparently still a thing.</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay listen.\u201d Beca squeezes Emily\u2019s arms. \u201cFirst, you\u2019re not the worst captain ever. If Chloe were here, she would tell you exactly who is, and it\u2019s probably some aca-bitch from the 1960s.\u201d Emily chokes out a small laugh and relief washes over Beca. She really hates tears.</p>\n<p>\u201cSecond,\u201d Beca continues. \u201cYou\u2019re not tarnishing the Bellas name. Fat Amy already did that with MuffGate. It doesn\u2019t really get worse than flashing your vajayjay to the President, you know what I mean?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut she has such a lovely vagina.\u201d Emily grins a little and Beca grimaces involuntarily. She makes eye contact with Benji briefly, but he just shrugs.</p>\n<p>\u201cGross, dude.\u201d Emily gives her a watery smile and wipes under her eyes. Beca squeezes her arms again. \u201cOkay, cool, so no more tears.\u201d</p>\n<p>Emily nods. \u201cYeah, got it. No more tears. Totally.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGreat.\u201d Beca lets go of Emily\u2019s arms. \u201cYou just focus on school and when it comes to Nationals, just do your best, okay? It\u2019s gonna be fine if you don\u2019t win. I know it seems like it, but it won\u2019t be the end of the world if you don\u2019t. Just have fun with it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Beca takes a second to process what she\u2019d just said and decides that maybe she <em>is</em> in an alternate dimension. When did she start sounding like her dad?</p>\n<p>Still, Emily\u2019s mostly stopped crying now, letting out a few sniffles here and there.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo,\u201d Beca continues. \u201cYou do all that stuff and I\u2019ll see you on your Spring Break if Mama Junk lets you come out again. Sound cool?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, sounds cool.\u201d Emily has that look that means she\u2019s going to hug her so Beca just lets it happen, allowing long arms to wrap around her shoulders. \u201cThanks for everything, we had the best time.\u201d</p>\n<p>Beca hides her smile in Emily\u2019s shoulder. \u201cYeah, of course, it\u2019s, you know, whatever.\u201d She pulls back and makes her face serious again. \u201cBe good.\u201d She points her finger at Benji. \u201cYou, too.\u201d</p>\n<p>He gives her a quick side-hug. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I don\u2019t make treble, anymore.\u201d He beams and Beca wrinkles her nose.</p>\n<p>\u201cI hate puns.\u201d He just grins that dorky Benji smile and she rolls her eyes. \u201cAlright, get going before you miss your flight.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, Mom.\u201d Emily mimics her eye-roll and Beca pretends that\u2019s not the weirdest thing she\u2019s ever seen.</p>\n<p>Emily and Benji grab their suitcases and wave one last time before disappearing inside the automatic doors of the airport. Beca stares after them for a second, wondering why it feels like a giant chasm just opened in her chest.</p>\n<p>She rolls her eyes at herself. Why is she being so dramatic?</p>\n<p>Yeah. She\u2019s definitely in an alternate dimension.</p>\n<p>//</p>\n<p>The holiday ends all too quickly and before she knows it, Beca\u2019s back in the studio Monday morning, dialed into the music and her laptop.</p>\n<p>She\u2019s supposed to be meeting with Jesse later to hash out some stuff he did over the weekend, but her thoughts feel like they\u2019re running in a million different directions and she\u2019s having trouble grasping onto one long enough to concentrate.</p>\n<p>After about twenty minutes of her just sitting there and tapping at the trackpad of her laptop without actually doing anything, she decides she can be done until she has to meet up with Jesse later. She pushes out of her chair and opens the studio door, stopping in her tracks when she hears a familiar song echoing down the hall.</p>\n<p>The beat pulls her in and she follows it to Chloe\u2019s room. The door is open so Beca leans against the frame and crosses her arms. Chloe\u2019s standing in front of her mirror doing her eyeliner, her voice mixing lightly in the air with the music.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou know David Guetta?\u201d</p>\n<p>Chloe glances up and meets her eyes in the mirror. She smirks. \u201cWhat, have I been living under a rock?\u201d Beca grins and shakes her head as Chloe purses her lips in the mirror. \u201cI need your opinion, Bec.\u201d</p>\n<p>Beca raises an eyebrow. \u201cFire away?\u201d</p>\n<p>Chloe spins around so they\u2019re face to face and rolls her eyes. \u201cClever. Okay, but how do I look right now?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou look great,\u201d Beca says automatically, and she means it. Chloe always looks great.</p>\n<p>Chloe sighs in frustration as if to say that Beca should humor her. Beca bites her lip to keep from smiling. \u201cSeriously, Becs. Do you think these jeans are too casual?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell,\u201d Beca says, quirking her eyebrows. \u201cThat\u2019s kind of relative. Too casual for what? The Oscars? Because yeah, dude, I\u2019m pretty sure you gotta wear designer for your red carpet debut.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Beca</em>,\u201d Chloe chastises, one hand coming on her hip and cocking it to the side. \u201cI have to look presentable. I\u2019m meeting with Principal Mueller today.\u201d</p>\n<p>Beca crinkles her nose. \u201cWhat for?\u201d</p>\n<p>Chloe shrugs, trying for nonchalance but falling short. \u201cHe didn\u2019t say. So let\u2019s hope I\u2019m not getting fired.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, come on. You\u2019re not getting fired.\u201d If Beca knows anything, it\u2019s that. Chloe\u2019s the best teacher around. Not that Beca\u2019s ever been to any of her classes or anything, obviously, but it\u2019s <em>Chloe</em>. There\u2019s no way anyone in their right mind could fire her.</p>\n<p>Chloe doesn\u2019t say anything, just turns back around to look in the mirror, her head tilting to the side. Beca steps into the room a little more.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd I was being serious,\u201d Beca adds as Chloe fusses with her hair. \u201cYou look great.\u201d</p>\n<p>And she does. Beca loves when Chloe wears her hair like that, the ends falling in waves across her shoulders. It reminds her of when they first met, back during Beca\u2019s freshman year when Chloe was going to stop at nothing to make sure they were friends.</p>\n<p>And her eyes are obviously always a really gorgeous blue, eyeliner or no eyeliner. And like yeah, Chloe\u2019s always been able to wear a pair of jeans and the ones she\u2019s wearing now hug her butt in an especially nice way that Beca thinks is awesome.</p>\n<p>And okay, Beca is kind of gay sometimes, but honestly, Chloe looks great <em>all</em> the time. It\u2019s just a fact.</p>\n<p>\u201cQuit staring at my butt.\u201d</p>\n<p>Beca\u2019s eyes snap up and meet Chloe\u2019s in the mirror. She feels her cheeks burn hot when Chloe winks at her.</p>\n<p>Chloe holds her gaze for a second before shifting to look at herself again. Beca watches her bite her lip and she realizes Chloe is nervous, which is something she hasn\u2019t seen in a few years.</p>\n<p>Not since Worlds anyway.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sure whatever she wants to talk to you about will be fine, Chlo.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019m sure it will be, too.\u201d Chloe purses her lips like she wants to say something, but she just ends up repeating, \u201cyeah,\u201d again really quietly as she tugs a little at her shirt.</p>\n<p>The action makes something pull inside Beca because for the past couple of days, Chloe\u2019s just seemed\u2026 <em>off</em>. \u201cIs everything else okay with you?\u201d She asks cautiously, hoping to not bring on any tears. Beca\u2019s definitely had enough of <em>those</em> in the past few days and anything she experienced with Emily would be one hundred times more uncomfortable with Chloe. Beca <em>hates</em> when Chloe cries more than she hates anything. Even romcoms.</p>\n<p>Chloe just hums in response, though, seemingly unaffected. \u201cUh huh.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay\u2026\u201d There\u2019s practically alarm bells ringing in Beca\u2019s head at this point, but she doesn\u2019t know what to do because while she has a lot of practice dealing with Chloe saying too much, she doesn\u2019t have any practice with Chloe not saying anything. Chloe\u2019s never <em>not</em> said something before.</p>\n<p>Eventually Chloe seems to be satisfied that she looks fine and she turns around, expression clearing into the easy-going one that Beca\u2019s used to. She grabs her bag off the bed and when she meets Beca\u2019s eyes again, she\u2019s smiling.</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it,\u201d Chloe says and runs her finger between Beca\u2019s eyebrows. \u201cYou\u2019ll get premature wrinkles.\u201d</p>\n<p>Beca swats at Chloe\u2019s hand lightly. \u201cStop it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Chloe just grins, leaning down slightly to press a kiss to Beca\u2019s cheek. Heat flares to the spot automatically and Beca shivers.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll talk to you later,\u201d Chloe says against her hair and it makes Beca feel more off-balance than usual.</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she manages to choke out and heat rushes through her again, simmering in her stomach and flowing up her neck.</p>\n<p>Chloe winks at her again and breezes past her, leaving Beca confused and with her mouth hanging open, wondering what the hell is <em>happening</em> to her.</p>\n<p>//</p>\n<p>If there\u2019s one things Beca absolutely loathes about Los Angeles, it\u2019s the traffic.</p>\n<p>She taps restlessly on her steering wheel, the music on the radio doing nothing to calm her down.</p>\n<p>She\u2019d been just getting ready to leave Jesse\u2019s when Chloe had texted her, and if the text hadn\u2019t made her tense enough as it is, now she has to sit through this craptastic traffic with the cacophony of horns echoing across the freeway every minute.</p>\n<p>She sighs and glances down at the phone in her lap, Chloe\u2019s text still open on the screen.</p>\n<p><strong>Chloe (7:21pm): </strong>Come home ASAP!!</p>\n<p>She\u2019d quickly responded, <em>is everything okay?</em> but so far Chloe hadn\u2019t texted back and she\u2019s kind of freaking out.</p>\n<p>After what feels like forever (or at least the longest twenty minutes of her life), she finally pulls into the driveway and slides out of her car.</p>\n<p>\u201cChloe?\u201d She calls as she opens the door.</p>\n<p>\u201cIn the kitchen!\u201d</p>\n<p>Beca didn\u2019t realize how fast her heart was beating until it started to slow. Chloe at least sounded fine. Still, she hurries to the kitchen, part of her bracing for the worst when she pokes her head around the corner.</p>\n<p>Turns out she\u2019d worried for nothing, though, because Chloe is standing over the sink tossing a salad and smiling to herself. She\u2019s still in the outfit she\u2019d left in that morning. Beca tries not to stare at her butt again.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d</p>\n<p>Chloe glances over her shoulder, shooting Beca a smile so bright that Beca feels her own lips instinctively pull upward.\u00a0 \u201cI got pizza. And wine.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI see that.\u201d Beca raises her eyebrows. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBecause,\u201d Chloe beams. \u201cWe\u2019re celebrating!\u201d</p>\n<p>Beca tries not to think about how well everything turned out last time they celebrated, and instead focuses on the fact that Chloe clearly has some good news. \u201cCelebrating what exactly?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPrincipal Mueller has decided to let me teach an a cappella class next year!\u201d</p>\n<p>Beca smiles slightly, taken aback by Chloe\u2019s clear excitement. \u201cThat\u2019s a class?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes!\u201d Chloe grins. \u201cIt\u2019s basically like the Bellas, but we meet during class instead of in the afternoon like a club. There are competitions and stuff.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo like, <em>Glee</em>?\u201d</p>\n<p>Chloe\u2019s eyes flash sternly, but her smile remains in place. Beca think she looks half-crazed. \u201cIf you had even watched an episode of <em>Glee</em> with me then you\u2019d know that that\u2019s not a cappella. It\u2019s very competitive, Beca.\u201d</p>\n<p>Beca holds her hands up innocently. \u201cI believe it.\u201d She crosses her arms, shaking her head in amusement. \u201cWell congrats dude.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThanks. I\u2019m really excited,\u201d Chloe gushes. \u201cI just hope I do an okay job. I\u2019m a little rusty.\u201d</p>\n<p>Beca doesn\u2019t believe that for a second, if Chloe\u2019s shower singing is anything to go by. Still, even if she was rusty, it\u2019s clear that her enthusiasm would be enough to make up for it. \u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019ll be the best a cappella coach ever.\u201d She hopes Chloe knows she means it and isn\u2019t being sarcastic. For once.</p>\n<p>Chloe crinkles her nose happily so Beca thinks she gets it. It\u2019s super cute and Beca can\u2019t help but smile back at her.</p>\n<p>\u201cBut next time, don\u2019t text me like that,\u201d Beca says. \u201cI almost love-tapped some idiot on the highway to get back here quickly.\u201d</p>\n<p>Chloe tilts her head to the side. \u201cAw, you were worried about me?\u201d</p>\n<p>Beca rolls her eyes exasperatedly. \u201cYou said ASAP, which inherently suggests a sense of urgency, Chlo.\u201d</p>\n<p>Chloe just gives her this sappy smile that makes embarrassment crawl up Beca\u2019s neck. She looks away, anywhere but at Chloe, eyes landing on the pizza and wine sitting on the island. \u201cWanna get drunk?\u201d She smirks and glances back at Chloe.</p>\n<p>\u201cDuh.\u201d</p>\n<p>Chloe grabs plates and puts some salad and pizza on each while Beca pours the wine. They migrate to the living room and Chloe turns on one of the music channels that Beca gets on her TV. Top 40s hits start streaming through the speakers and Beca turns to Chloe and raises her glass.</p>\n<p>\u201cTo your success,\u201d she says.</p>\n<p>Chloe beams at her, shaking her head. \u201cTo <em>our</em> success.\u201d</p>\n<p>Beca grins back. \u201cTo our success.\u201d</p>\n<p>//</p>\n<p>\u201cBeca?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHmmm?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m drunk.\u201d</p>\n<p>Beca grins lazily, her eyes fluttering closed as Chloe\u2019s fingers tangle with hers. \u201cMe too.\u201d</p>\n<p>Chloe watches her, letting her eyes roam over Beca\u2019s face, from the sharp outline of her nose and down to her lips. They look soft. She wants to kiss them.</p>\n<p>But she\u2019s drunk and Beca\u2019s drunk and they\u2019re laying on the floor and maybe it\u2019s not the right moment. It\u2019s just been a long time since she\u2019s kissed anyone. She wonders how long it\u2019s been since Beca\u2019s kissed someone.</p>\n<p>\u201cBeca?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHmmm?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t it work out with you and Jesse?\u201d</p>\n<p>Beca\u2019s eyes blink open and she rolls over on her side so she can see Chloe. Beca stares at her with pursed lips for a long time and Chloe thinks she might not answer, but eventually her lips thin out and she shrugs.</p>\n<p>\u201cI dunno,\u201d she says finally. \u201cI think we just stopped loving each other in that way, or whatever.\u201d She quirks her eyebrows. \u201cWe\u2019re better as friends.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBecause you started as friends?\u201d Chloe\u2019s stomach flips in disappointment. She tries to pretend it doesn\u2019t.</p>\n<p>Beca shakes her head, though. \u201cNo I don\u2019t think so.\u201d She bites her lip. \u201cOkay, you know when we were getting ready to go on the stage at Worlds? And Fat Amy was giving that weird speech and we were just kind of standing there and smiling at each other and everything around us seemed so big and like the future might go on forever, but we were just <em>there</em>, like in that moment and it was a bubble of just us and the Bellas and the music?\u201d</p>\n<p>Chloe smiles at the memory. \u201cYeah, that was the best moment of my life.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, mine too.\u201d One corner of Beca\u2019s mouth pulls up in a half-smile, her eyes softening at Chloe. Beca shrugs self-consciously. \u201cJesse just didn\u2019t make me feel like that moment anymore, I guess.\u201d</p>\n<p>They hold eye contact for a second, Beca\u2019s eyes flicking back and forth between hers. Then she squeezes Chloe\u2019s hand and looks away, back up at the ceiling. \u201cIt was pretty mutual, I think,\u201d Beca says. \u201cI didn\u2019t make him feel the way movie endings make him feel, either. I wasn\u2019t the best part, you know?\u201d</p>\n<p>Chloe crinkles her nose and shakes her head. \u201cYou\u2019re the best part for me,\u201d she says lightly.</p>\n<p>Beca\u2019s mouth falls open a little and her cheeks flush bright red and Chloe briefly wonders if she said too much.</p>\n<p>But they\u2019re drunk and laying on the floor holding hands, and their dog that they own <em>together</em> is sleeping in the corner, and it just felt right.</p>\n<p>Beca doesn\u2019t seem to really mind, she just grins and avoids Chloe\u2019s eyes. \u201cWanna do something dumb because we\u2019re drunk and we can and it\u2019ll piss Lindsey off?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDuh,\u201d Chloe says even though she doesn\u2019t really want to make Lindsey mad, but maybe it\u2019s becoming tradition and Chloe\u2019s a sucker for Beca\u2019s smile.</p>\n<p>Beca grabs her phone and tugs Chloe into a sitting position. \u201cHonestly, the only good time to take selfies is when it pisses off Lindsey.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBeca,\u201d Chloe tries to sound disapproving, but it ends up just being this soft whisper. Beca grins at her and hands her phone to Chloe.</p>\n<p>\u201cHere, you have longer arms.\u201d Chloe snorts and Beca rolls her eyes. \u201cShut up. Okay, do something cute.\u201d</p>\n<p>Chloe giggles. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019m the one in this relationship who needs to work on that.\u201d</p>\n<p>Beca side-eyes her. \u201cTake the picture or I\u2019ll tell Po to bite you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPo doesn\u2019t listen to you,\u201d Chloe laughs and Beca nudges her side with her elbow. \u201cOkay, okay!\u201d</p>\n<p>Chloe holds the phone up and presses her lips to Beca\u2019s cheek. She closes her eyes and taps the capture button. \u201cThere,\u201d she says, pulling away. Beca takes the phone back and Chloe leans her head on Beca\u2019s shoulder to look at it.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis is the most coupley photo I\u2019ve ever taken,\u201d Beca mutters and snorts out a laugh. Chloe looks down at the phone, grinning at Beca\u2019s open-mouthed smile as Chloe kisses her cheek. It\u2019s super cute and Chloe is immediately obsessed with it.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh my God, we\u2019re so cute,\u201d she gushes. \u201cSend it to me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOne sec, gotta upload it first.\u201d She shares it to Instragram with the caption \u201c<em>if I\u2019m gonna be stuck with someone forever, then it\u2019s good we at least look cute together\u2026 @gingrspiceandevrythingnice</em> <em>#lovebirds\u201d</em> and links it to her Twitter.</p>\n<p>Chloe smiles into Beca\u2019s shoulder. \u201cLindsey is going to kill you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Beca smirks. \u201cWell, that\u2019s what she gets for perpetuating this shit. And whatever, I can take her.\u201d</p>\n<p>Chloe shoots her a skeptical grin. \u201cOkay, Tiny Terror.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFight me,\u201d Beca scoffs and it\u2019s the furthest thing from tough Chloe\u2019s ever heard. Laughter bubbles up her throat and she pokes Beca in the side, watching as she squirms. \u201cChloe, no! No!\u201d Chloe just digs her fingers in harder. Beca yelps and it\u2019s so un-Becalike that Chloe feels her own sides start to ache with laughter.</p>\n<p>\u201cPo, attack!\u201d Beca pushes her hands away and tries to crawl across the floor. Po doesn\u2019t even lift his head, just stares at them with clear apathy. Beca flops down on her stomach. \u201cUgh no. I\u2019m too drunk for this.\u201d</p>\n<p>Chloe grins. \u201cSucks.\u201d She sits on Beca\u2019s butt. \u201cBut yeah, Becs, you <em>totally</em> can take Lindsey.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI want a divorce,\u201d Beca scowls into the carpet.</p>\n<p>\u201cNot a chance, Mitchell.\u201d Chloe laughs, feeling carefree and happy like the swelling of the chorus in her favorite songs. \u201cPo, come!\u201d She taps Beca\u2019s back with her palm and Po pushes himself up, trotting over to them with a wagging tail. He licks at Beca\u2019s face and she sputters. Chloe\u2019s cheeks hurt from smiling too much. \u201cGood dog, Po!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo!\u201d Beca shouts. \u201cBad dog, Po! Bad dog!\u201d</p>\n<p>Chloe decides to spare Beca and tugs at Po\u2019s collar gently, pulling him away. She slides off of Beca and leans against her side instead.</p>\n<p>Beca groans, face still hidden in the carpet. \u201cI hate you so much.\u201d</p>\n<p>Chloe just grins. \u201cLove you, too.\u201d</p>\n<p>And if she means that in more ways than one, well, she\u2019s just going to have to deal with that tomorrow.</p>\n<p>//</p>\n<p>December arrives quicker than she expected. Before she knows it, Beca\u2019s hurrying to get her Christmas shopping done and frantically trying to finish laying down the theme of the score with Jesse before she has to go to New York next week.</p>\n<p>She\u2019s been locked in her studio for the past two days, and she\u2019s busy and tired, but she\u2019s proud of what her and Jesse have created and she can\u2019t wait to show it to Chloe.</p>\n<p>Beca blinks at the thought, eyes ungluing from her laptop screen to check the time.</p>\n<p><em>Fuck</em>.</p>\n<p>She\u2019s totally going to be late.</p>\n<p>She quickly saves and closes her laptop, hurrying to get dressed into acceptable clothes to wear to a concert. Or a choir concert at least. Chloe\u2019s student\u2019s winter choir concert.</p>\n<p>So like, jeans a nice jacket.</p>\n<p>Good enough.</p>\n<p>She hurries out the door and minutes later, she\u2019s speeding down the street, praying that the cops don\u2019t pull her over because then she\u2019d <em>really</em> be late, and Beca\u2019s never exactly prepared to confront a disappointed Chloe, so that just is not an option.</p>\n<p>She follows her GPS to the school Chloe teaches at and immediately feels like she\u2019s probably underdressed because it\u2019s super nice. Beca rolls her eyes. Private schools, man.</p>\n<p>When she walks in the school, she follows a sign to the auditorium and an elderly woman hands her a program and directs her to a seat on the end toward the back of the room.</p>\n<p>She settles in and gets comfortable just as the lights go down and the stage lights come on, revealing a bunch of kids in their school uniforms standing on a set of risers. Beca bites her lip to keep from smirking.</p>\n<p>Chloe walks onto the stage and for a second Beca feels her mouth drop open. Chloe\u2019s wearing this dark green dress and her hair falls across her shoulders in ringlets of red. Her smile is bright under the stage lights and Beca\u2019s heart gives a few extra forceful beats in her chest.</p>\n<p>She blinks a little, but when she opens her eyes, Chloe\u2019s still standing there looking as gorgeous as ever.</p>\n<p>Chloe taps on the microphone in front of her, crinkling her nose when it causes a muffled thump noise to echo throughout the auditorium. \u201cHello, everyone,\u201d she says into the microphone, her hand raising in a small wave. \u201cSome of you may know me from the last concert, but if not, then I\u2019m Ms. Beale and thanks for coming tonight! We\u2019ve been working really hard on this stuff the last couple of weeks, so I hope you enjoy it! If you\u2019re feeling extra charitable this season, there\u2019s a table in the lobby where you can donate to the Red Cross. Thanks again and enjoy the show!\u201d</p>\n<p>Chloe sets the microphone back on the stand and turns around to face the kids. Someone starts playing the piano on the side of the stage and Chloe starts to conduct, her hands gesturing at the altos to begin.</p>\n<p>The kids sing a few Christmas songs that Beca recognizes, one she doesn\u2019t, and two songs in another language that could be satanic chants for all Beca knows.</p>\n<p>The choir is pretty good, Beca admits, and she feels herself soften around the edges. Her chest swells with pride as the audience claps loudly after a song. Chloe smiles at the applause and pats the soloist on the shoulder with a thumbs up as he walks back to his spot on the risers.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s my son,\u201d the lady next to her whispers and Beca grits her teeth so that she doesn\u2019t roll her eyes. Good for you, lady.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s very good,\u201d she says instead, smiling politely.</p>\n<p>The lady nods. \u201cThey sound wonderful, don\u2019t you think?\u201d Beca just nods. \u201cYou must be very proud of your son or daughter.\u201d</p>\n<p>Beca\u2019s eyes widen and she feels slightly offended because she definitely <em>does not</em> look old enough to have kids. \u201cOh, no. I\u2019m not.. I don\u2019t have kids.\u201d She awkwardly points at Chloe. \u201cMs. Beale is my\u2026\u201d Beca knits her eyebrows together. \u201cFianc\u00e9e,\u201d she finishes lamely.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh!\u201d The lady covers Beca\u2019s hand with her own. Beca pulls away. \u201cWell, congratulations! Ms. Beale is <em>stunning</em> and Michael just loves her.\u201d</p>\n<p>Beca blinks and tries to smile again, which is surprisingly not as difficult as she expected. Chloe <em>does</em> look stunning and <em>obviously</em> her son loves her. Everyone loves Chloe.</p>\n<p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Beca replies, and is luckily saved from having to say anything as Chloe starts talking into the microphone, thanking everyone for coming again. She urges them all to donate and Beca honestly wouldn\u2019t be surprised if most of the audience does. Not when Chloe\u2019s smiling like that, all pretty and sincere.</p>\n<p>Finally it\u2019s over, and the audience starts to trickle out into the lobby. There\u2019s a long line at the donation table and Beca just shakes her head because of course.</p>\n<p>She hovers near the wall and eventually some of the kids start to appear, looking for the parents and hugging each other. Beca rolls her eyes at all the dad\u2019s giving their daughters flowers. Her dad may not have been like, the total best dad ever, but at least he never gave her flowers because gross.</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you Beca Mitchell?\u201d</p>\n<p>Beca\u2019s eyes focus on the figure in front of her, a tall girl with long black hair. She\u2019s in a school uniform, but she\u2019s clearly trying to rebel against that whole de-individuality thing because she has the sleeves of her shirt pushed up to her elbows and Beca would guess that her black Chucks are not standard uniform.</p>\n<p>\u201cUh.\u201d Beca darts her eyes to the side before looking back at the girl. \u201cYeah?\u201d</p>\n<p>The girl bites her lip, her eyes mimicking Beca\u2019s in the way she looks away before coming back to stare at her. \u201cCould I have an autograph?\u201d</p>\n<p>Beca\u2019s eyes widen in surprise. \u201cAn autograph?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah?\u201d The girl shifts uncomfortably, which like, Beca totally gets. \u201cUmm, <em>On the Rocks</em> is like, my favorite album.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d Beca says, finally getting it. \u201cOh. Yeah, dude, totally.\u201d</p>\n<p>The girl smiles and takes her backpack off her shoulder, rummaging inside it for a minute. She pulls out some notebook paper and a pen and hands it to Beca.</p>\n<p>Beca\u2019s not usually one to get sappy, but like someone <em>recognized</em> her, and asked for her autograph, and told her that Beca\u2019s album is her favorite.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d She asks.</p>\n<p>The girl shoots her a little smile. \u201cUh. Beth?\u201d</p>\n<p>Beca smirks playfully. \u201cYou don\u2019t sound too sure.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sure,\u201d the girl says, smiling back at Beca. Beca turns to the wall and scribbles a quick note on the paper and signs her name at the bottom. She hands it back to the girl. \u201cThanks,\u201d Beth says.</p>\n<p>Beca grins. \u201cWhat\u2019s your favorite song on the album?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell I really like all of them, but my favorite is probably Catch-Up. I don\u2019t know,\u201d the girl gushes, suddenly extremely enthusiastic. \u201cI just love the sound on that song, like the lyrics are great obviously, but the music just fills these spaces in my chest that I didn\u2019t really know were there before and I just feel so\u2026 so, like, present, or something when I listen to that song. You feel me?\u201d</p>\n<p>Beca kind of just stares because she totally knows the feeling. It\u2019s what drew her to music in the first place. \u201cYeah, I\u2026 feel you,\u201d she says.</p>\n<p>The girl opens her mouth to reply, but a voice calls over the chatter of the lobby. \u201cBeth, let\u2019s go!\u201d</p>\n<p>Beth kind of frowns, but then shrugs. \u201cI gotta go. That\u2019s my mom and she has to pay the babysitter.\u201d She smiles at Beca. \u201cThanks again. And also you and Ms. Beale are really cute together. I see your pics on Insta.\u201d</p>\n<p>Beca blinks in surprise. \u201cOh. Thanks.\u201d She smiles at Beth, who waves over her shoulder as she walks away.</p>\n<p>A second later, arms loop around her waist and a chin digs into her shoulder. \u201cOh my God, did you just meet Beth?\u201d</p>\n<p>Beca turns her head to the side, her nose inches from Chloe\u2019s. \u201cHi Ms. Beale.\u201d</p>\n<p>Chloe grins. \u201cIsn\u2019t she cute? She\u2019s like my favorite, but don\u2019t tell the others.\u201d</p>\n<p>Beca snorts and is about to respond, but the lady who was sitting next to Beca during the show walks up to them. \u201cMs. Beale!\u201d</p>\n<p>Chloe\u2019s chin lifts up from Beca\u2019s shoulder, but she doesn\u2019t move her arms. Beca leans away from the woman and further into Chloe in hopes that the woman doesn\u2019t touch her again.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m Michael\u2019s mother and I just wanted to say that you put together a beautiful concert!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d Chloe says, voice bubbly in Beca\u2019s ear. \u201cWell thank you. Michael did a great job tonight.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThank you,\u201d the woman gushes, clearly proud of her son. Beca tries to keep her face passive as to not give away her disgust. \u201cMe and your fianc\u00e9e made friends tonight, and I have to say, she is definitely a keeper. She seemed very smitten with you the whole concert.\u201d She winks at Beca who imagines she\u2019s a darker shade of red than a stop sign.</p>\n<p>She feels Chloe smile against the side of her head. \u201cOh, she was, was she?\u201d</p>\n<p>Beca scowls, she can\u2019t help it.</p>\n<p>The woman smiles at them knowingly. \u201cYou\u2019re a beautiful couple.\u201d She waggles her fingers at them. \u201cHave a good holiday!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBye!\u201d Chloe calls. Beca steps out of the hug and turns around to face her. Chloe flashes her a smile and Beca almost caves, but she bites the inside of her cheek to keep from grinning. She\u2019s already <em>blushing</em>. Ugh.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo,\u201d Chloe says, drawing out the word. \u201cDid you like it?\u201d</p>\n<p>Beca raises an eyebrow. \u201cOf course I did, Chlo.\u201d She shrugs. She doesn\u2019t love choir concerts really, but she loves Chloe, so obviously she liked it enough. She clears her throat. \u201cAnd you look super beautiful, by the way.\u201d</p>\n<p>Chloe grins and looks down at her dress. \u201cDon\u2019t you love this dress? It\u2019s so pretty.\u201d</p>\n<p>Beca didn\u2019t really mean the dress, but she nods anyway. \u201cYeah, totally.\u201d</p>\n<p>Chloe\u2019s eyes twinkle knowingly. \u201cWell, I\u2019m glad you had a good time.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Beca says. \u201cMe, too.\u201d</p>\n<p>Chloe points back toward the auditorium. \u201cI have to help them put those risers away, but I\u2019ll see you at home?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSure,\u201d Beca nods. \u201cUmm, I can like, pick us up some food and then I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Chloe says, eyes going soft as they meet Beca\u2019s. Beca can\u2019t really look away. \u201cI\u2019ll see you there then.\u201d She gives Beca a kiss on the cheek, winking as she pulls away. Beca\u2019s cheeks feel like they\u2019re on fire and she clears her throat, watching as Chloe walks away.</p>\n<p>The whole drive home she feels Chloe\u2019s arms around her waist and her lips on her cheek and her stomach feels all weird like something inside of her has shifted.</p>\n<p>When she finally pulls into the driveway, she\u2019s still trying to figure out what.</p>\n<p>//</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you have everything?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat about your toothbrush?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLaptop charger?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUh huh.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cChristmas spirit?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cChloe.\u201d Beca rolls her eyes as Chloe closes the trunk of the car and hands Beca her suitcase, wheeling it over the pavement of the drop-off line at LAX. \u201cI have everything. And if I don\u2019t, well it\u2019s too late now.\u201d</p>\n<p>Chloe purses her lips, messing with the straps of Beca\u2019s bag. \u201cI guess you\u2019re right.\u201d She adjusts Beca\u2019s bag one more time, smoothing the strap on her shoulder. \u201cThis trip is just so important. I want everything to be perfect for you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Beca shrugs. \u201cIt\u2019s gonna be all good, I promise.\u201d Except for the part where she\u2019s on TV, but if she doesn\u2019t think about it too much, then she\u2019ll be fine.</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Chloe says softly. She gives Beca a watery smile. \u201cI\u2019m gonna miss you, Bec.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll miss you, too.\u201d Beca squeezes Chloe\u2019s arm. \u201cIt\u2019s only a week. It\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p>\n<p>Chloe nods and takes a deep breath, which seems to help. She puts on a brave smile that has Beca\u2019s heart aching.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo, I left your Christmas present on my dresser,\u201d Beca says. \u201cYou can\u2019t open it until Christmas, though.\u201d</p>\n<p>Chloe nods, smiling coyly. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I remember our deal.\u201d</p>\n<p>Beca narrows her eyes though because Chloe sucks at waiting for surprises. \u201cSwear?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSwear,\u201d Chloe says, holding up her pinkie. Beca rolls her eyes, but twists her own around Chloe\u2019s.</p>\n<p>\u201cAlright.\u201d She glances at her watch. \u201cI should probably get going.\u201d</p>\n<p>Chloe pouts, but nods and tugs Beca closer by the collar of her jacket. Beca leans into the hug, her arms looping around Chloe\u2019s waist. Something swoops in her stomach, which has been happening a lot recently when Chloe hugs her. It doesn\u2019t feel bad, it just throws Beca off, like she\u2019s trying to walk on ice or something.</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t feed Po human food while I\u2019m gone,\u201d Beca says into Chloe\u2019s shoulder. \u201cHe\u2019s going to get fat.\u201d</p>\n<p>Chloe giggles in her ear. \u201cNo promises.\u201d She squeezes Beca really hard around the middle and Beca squeezes back.</p>\n<p>When they pull away, she gives Chloe a small smile. \u201cI\u2019ll let you know when I\u2019m getting on the plane.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd when you get off the plane. And when you get to the hotel. And when you meet Seth Meyers.\u201d</p>\n<p>Beca smirks. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, dear,\u201d she says sarcastically. \u201cI\u2019ll let you know every time I breathe, too.\u201d</p>\n<p>Chloe points at her sternly. \u201cYou better.\u201d</p>\n<p>Beca shakes her head, grinning. \u201cOkay I will.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGood.\u201d Chloe hugs her again really quickly, then gives her a little push toward the door of the airport. \u201cOkay, now get out of here. Go be successful and famous somewhere else.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAlright, alright.\u201d She grabs her suitcase and tosses a wave and a smile over her shoulder, but Chloe has already gotten into the car and is merging back into traffic.</p>\n<p>As Beca watches the car drive away, she wonders why it feels like she\u2019s forgetting something.</p>\n<p>//</p>\n<p>Chloe spends the next two days trying to keep busy. She takes Po on his walks and gets some last minute Christmas shopping done for her family. She goes to Pilates and tries to think of some possible song arrangements for her classes next semester.</p>\n<p>She spends a lot of time thinking about how much her life has changed in the past couple of months. Los Angeles has become her home in so many ways that it feels weird to think about going back to Atlanta, even for a few days.</p>\n<p>Still, as she drives on the freeway with her windows open and music blasting, or settles down in the evening to watch Chopped with a glass of wine, she can\u2019t help but feel lonely. The place feels empty without Beca\u2019s shoes messily cluttered by the door and the soft vibrations of a bassline shaking the hallway.</p>\n<p>Chloe knows it\u2019s only been a few days, but she misses Beca\u2019s half-smile and her sarcastic scowls and her constant tap-tapping on every surface within reach.</p>\n<p>As the days extend, Chloe becomes more and more certain that the things that make Los Angeles feel like home aren\u2019t the things about the city that make it <em>feel like home</em>.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s <em>Beca</em> that makes this place feel like home, like something she wants to keep coming back to, a feeling that she doesn\u2019t want to be without.</p>\n<p>She\u2019s never felt like this way about anything before, not even music, but as she curls up in her bed at night, Po sleeping in the corner and Beca\u2019s music in her ears, she recognizes the feeling exactly for what it is.</p>\n<p>She\u2019s in love.</p>\n<p>//</p>\n<p>Chloe\u2019s in line at Starbucks when she gets the first message.</p>\n<p><strong>Becs (2:18pm): </strong>I\u2019m about to meet Seth.</p>\n<p>Chloe grins and is about to reply when another text comes through.</p>\n<p><strong>Becs (2:18pm):</strong> I think I\u2019ve turned into Aubrey. I\u2019m gonna throw up.</p>\n<p><strong>Chloe (2:19pm): </strong>You\u2019re going to be fine!! :)</p>\n<p><strong>Becs (2:20pm): </strong>New York is freezing and I\u2019m wearing my leather jacket but I\u2019m so nervous I\u2019m sweating right through it</p>\n<p><strong>Chloe (2:21pm): </strong>So just take it off, Becs.</p>\n<p>She expects another reply, but nothing comes and by this time, she\u2019s ordered her coffee and sat down outside.</p>\n<p>She checks Facebook and Instagram on her phone and finally it buzzes with a text.</p>\n<p><strong>Becs (2:29pm): </strong>NO I have pit stains.</p>\n<p><strong>Becs (2:30pm): </strong>[Image Attachment]</p>\n<p>Chloe clicks the picture to enlarge it, gasping a little as it grows on her screen. It\u2019s a selfie of Beca and Seth Meyers, and Chloe rolls her eyes because neither of them are smiling, just staring straight-faced into the camera. She wonders if Beca told him not to smile just to make Chloe laugh.</p>\n<p>Either way, she grins and she immediately starts responding.</p>\n<p><strong>Chloe (2:31pm): </strong>!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>\n<p><strong>Chloe (2:31pm): </strong>OMG</p>\n<p><strong>Chloe (2:31pm): </strong>YOU\u2019RE WITH SETH</p>\n<p><strong>Becs (2:32pm): </strong>Excuse you. Seth is with ME</p>\n<p>She snorts as another text comes through.</p>\n<p><strong>Becs (2:33pm): </strong>It just started filming though and I\u2019m going on soon so I\u2019ll talk to you after.</p>\n<p><strong>Chloe (2:34pm): </strong>Kk. You\u2019re going to be great. I love you. Please try to SMILE on-screen</p>\n<p><strong>Becs (2:35pm): </strong>Don\u2019t tell me what to do</p>\n<p>Chloe shakes her head, ready to put her phone away, but it buzzes again.</p>\n<p><strong>Becs (2:35pm): </strong>I love you too.</p>\n<p>//</p>\n<p>Chloe doesn\u2019t usually watch late night TV, except for Jimmy Fallon sometimes, so it feels weird to turn on NBC as the news is ending.</p>\n<p>It feels even weirder that she\u2019s turning it on to watch Beca.</p>\n<p>Beca had called after the show filmed and Chloe had asked how it went, but Beca wouldn\u2019t tell her much other than that it was all a blur and she might\u2019ve blacked out during it because she can\u2019t even remember what she said.</p>\n<p>Chloe doesn\u2019t believe her really because Beca\u2019s always been fine in front of big audiences, nervous but not panicky like Aubrey.</p>\n<p>She\u2019s sure Beca just doesn\u2019t want to tell her what they talked about.</p>\n<p>\u201cJust tell me. I\u2019m going to watch it anyway,\u201d Chloe had whined, but Beca had just laughed into the phone.</p>\n<p><em>\u201cYou can wait until it airs just like everyone else.\u201d </em>Beca teased, but still wouldn\u2019t tell Chloe anything more than that she may have mentioned Chloe a little and talked about some embarrassing stuff. <em>\u201cBut that\u2019s all I\u2019m saying,</em>\u201d Beca told her.</p>\n<p>Needless to say, she\u2019s more than a little curious.</p>\n<p>Seth goes through his opening jokes and stories, and he has Chloe laughing, but she\u2019s anxiously awaiting the moment that Beca comes on screen so she\u2019s not paying too much attention. She barely even notices when Po jumps on the couch and puts his head in her lap.</p>\n<p>After a commercial break, Seth finally gets down to it. \u201cNow please welcome music artist and producer, Beca Mitchell!\u201d</p>\n<p>Chloe leans forward as Beca appears on her screen. She feels her heartrate pick up and a smile grow on her face. Beca\u2019s wearing her leather jacket, just like she said, over a purple top and black skinny jeans. Her hair falls straight over her shoulders and she looks so cool and so pretty and so <em>Beca</em>, Chloe almost dies.</p>\n<p>\u201cHi,\u201d Beca says, waving at the audience a little and turning to Seth as she sits down. \u201cThanks for having me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, it\u2019s your first time!\u201d Seth gives her his signature giant stage-smile.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt is!\u201d Beca says. Chloe cheeks hurt from smiling.</p>\n<p>Seth leans closer. \u201cSo it is your first time on the show, but it\u2019s not your first time national television, is that right?\u201d</p>\n<p>Becs nods, laughing a little. \u201cUnfortunately, no.\u201d</p>\n<p>Seth clearly knows where Beca is going, but he tilts his head to the side curiously. \u201cThat\u2019s right, I heard you had quite an embarrassing moment last time you were on TV.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cEmbarrassing is probably an understatement,\u201d Beca grins and turns to the audience. \u201cFor those of you who don\u2019t know, I used to do collegiate a cappella, and we were pretty good, so we were performing for the President on his birthday \u2013 \u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFor the President?\u201d Seth interrupts. \u201cSo very good is probably an understatement.\u201d</p>\n<p>Beca grins. \u201cI mean, we won like three national titles and were named World Champions, so we\u2019re kind of the best but\u2026\u201d Beca shrugs nonchalantly, then grins. The audience laughs lowly.</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay, sorry, sorry, continue.\u201d</p>\n<p>Beca taps her hands on her legs and Chloe smiles at the action. \u201cRight, so, we got asked to perform for the President, and we had this bit where one of our singers comes down on these aerial ribbon things, but there was a malfunction and her pants ripped and she wasn\u2019t wearing any underwear.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh no!\u201d Seth laughs. \u201cIn front of President Obama.\u201d</p>\n<p>Beca nods solemnly, her eyes wide, even as the audience erupts in laughter. \u201c<em>In front of President Obama</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou know, I think I remember hearing about that actually.\u201d Seth nods, leaning forward.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you did. It was all over the news.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh man,\u201d Seth chuckles. \u201cWell I hope this time isn\u2019t as embarrassing.\u201d</p>\n<p>Beca shrugs. \u201cSo far so good. There\u2019s still time left, though.\u201d</p>\n<p>Seth beams. \u201cOkay, so I hear you just a got a new dog.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI did,\u201d Beca nods, eyebrows quirking. \u201cPotato.\u201d</p>\n<p>Seth frowns questioningly. \u201cPotato?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe already had that name when we picked him up from the pound.\u201d Beca gestures in the air with her hands. \u201cIf it was up to me his name would be Biggie.\u201d</p>\n<p>Chloe snorts and scratches behind Po\u2019s ears. \u201cDon\u2019t listen to her, Po,\u201d she says as Seth laughs on-screen.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd is the dog good? Or what kind of dog is it?\u201d Seth asks.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s a boxer,\u201d Beca says. \u201cAnd thankfully, he hasn\u2019t been too bad, although if it was just me, who knows what kind of trouble he would get into.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d Seth says. \u201cYou\u2019re engaged.\u201d</p>\n<p>Beca\u2019s lips thin and Chloe knows she\u2019s holding back a smile. \u201cYes, and Chloe, that\u2019s my fianc\u00e9e, I swear she\u2019s like the dog whisperer.\u201d</p>\n<p>Chloe laughs.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe dog whisperer?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Beca nods. \u201cHe refuses to listen to me. I\u2019ll call him you know like, \u2018come here, Po!\u2019 and he just stands there staring at me like, all unimpressed. But then Chloe calls him and he comes running in seconds.\u201d</p>\n<p>Seth chuckles. \u201cBut he just ignores you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCompletely ignores me!\u201d Beca rolls her eyes for the camera. \u201cYou\u2019d think he\u2019d be grateful that I rescued him or something, but he\u2019s made it quite clear I\u2019m his second choice.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Seth says. \u201cOkay, so we\u2019re almost out of time, but congratulations on your engagement and on your first album!\u201d</p>\n<p>Beca grins. \u201cThank you!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBeca\u2019s album is called <em>On the Rocks</em> and it came out in November.\u201d He points to the audience. \u201cSo if you\u2019re looking for a last minute Christmas gift, there you go!\u201d</p>\n<p>Beca laughs and they shake hands. The camera pans to Seth. \u201cWe\u2019ll be back after the commercial with Bradley Cooper to talk about his upcoming movie, so stick around!\u201d</p>\n<p>The TV cuts to a commercial and Chloe immediately grabs her phone, just as it lights up with a call. She answers immediately.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh my God.\u201d</p>\n<p><em>\u201cHey.\u201d</em> Beca\u2019s clearly trying for nonchalance, but she called literally five seconds after it was done, so Chloe\u2019s not fooled. <em>\u201cSo, did you see it?\u201d</em></p>\n<p>\u201cObviously,\u201d Chloe says, her voice getting higher with excitement. \u201cYou were so good!\u201d</p>\n<p>Beca chuckles. <em>\u201cI\u2019m so awkward, but Seth did good at making it seem fine.\u201d</em></p>\n<p>Chloe shakes her head even though Beca can\u2019t see her. \u201cBecs, you weren\u2019t awkward. You were funny.\u201d</p>\n<p><em>\u201cI mean, it\u2019s hard not to be funny when you have a story like Kennedy Center in your back pocket.\u201d</em> Chloe can imagine Beca smirking. <em>\u201cFat Amy does all the work and I get all the credit.\u201d</em></p>\n<p>Chloe scoffs playfully. \u201cWow, you\u2019re such a good friend.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Oh, I know. She already called me and congratulated me for bringing up her finest moment.\u201d</em></p>\n<p>Chloe lets out a small laugh. \u201cI\u2019m sure she\u2019s proud of you. All the Bellas are.\u201d She smiles to herself. \u201cI know I am.\u201d</p>\n<p>There\u2019s silence on the other end and she hears Beca exhale loudly. <em>\u201cIs it the 29<sup>th</sup> yet?\u201d</em></p>\n<p>Chloe smiles fondly. \u201cI miss you, too.\u201d</p>\n<p><em>\u201cYou haven\u2019t opened your Christmas present yet have you?\u201d </em>Beca says and Chloe rolls her eyes at the obvious deflection.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, I promised, didn\u2019t I?\u201d</p>\n<p><em>\u201cOkay, okay</em>.\u201d Beca sighs. <em>\u201cI can\u2019t wait to be back in L.A. I\u2019m freezing my boobs off.\u201d</em></p>\n<p>They talk for a little bit more, but it\u2019s really late in New York with the time-change, and Beca has work to do the next day.</p>\n<p><em>\u201cOh, by the way,\u201d </em>Beca says just before she hangs up. <em>\u201cI talked to Lindsey and she said we\u2019ll be able to stop this whole engagement thing in the next couple of weeks.</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>Chloe feels her stomach drop. \u201cGreat,\u201d she manages to say, but it doesn\u2019t feel great. It feels like a stab to the chest.</p>\n<p>After they hang up, Chloe looks at her phone background, the selfie of her kissing Beca\u2019s cheek, and smiles fondly.</p>\n<p>Chloe\u2019s not sure, but she thinks Beca feels the same way about her that she feels about Beca because Beca is <em>different</em> around Chloe than she is around other people.</p>\n<p>Not that she isn\u2019t like Beca, but she lets Chloe give her hugs and hold her hand whenever she wants and she never says no to hanging out like she does sometimes with Jesse. And sometimes Beca looks at her with these really soft eyes that Chloe\u2019s never seen Beca give <em>anyone</em> and she always makes Chloe feel like she\u2019s the most beautiful girl around, which is just ridiculous because they live in L.A. and the other day they saw Mila Kunis when they were getting coffee.</p>\n<p>The thing is that even if Chloe thinks that Beca might feel the same way, she doesn\u2019t know for sure, because Beca doesn\u2019t like to talk about that stuff ever. Like, Beca barely even says <em>I love you</em> even if Chloe <em>knows</em> that she says it in other ways like making her dinner and coming to her choir concerts and talking about her on live TV.</p>\n<p>And Chloe loves L.A. and she loves Beca and she loves their dog and their house and their life.</p>\n<p>She doesn\u2019t want to screw any of that up just because she feels too much.</p>\n<p>Chloe\u2019s always felt too much and she knows that\u2019s intimidating, especially for people like Beca, but it\u2019s honestly never really been a huge deal before because if someone can\u2019t handle that than they\u2019ll never be able to handle Chloe and it\u2019s not worth her time.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s just that Beca is different, Chloe knows she is, and she just <em>fits</em> with Chloe like she fits with music and singing and driving with the windows down on a warm day.</p>\n<p>She doesn\u2019t want that feeling to go away, so she can\u2019t tell Beca, at least not until she\u2019s <em>positive</em> that Beca feels the same.</p>\n<p>She just doesn\u2019t know how much longer she can last.</p>\n<p>//</p>\n<p>Beca\u2019s glad when her plane finally lands in the terminal at LAX.</p>\n<p>Her time in New York was an adventure, but she\u2019s glad to be home where the weather isn\u2019t freezing and she can sleep in her own bed.</p>\n<p>She catches a taxi home, and the whole drive she listens to her music and wishes that she wasn\u2019t going home to an empty house. Chloe had left for Atlanta that morning, and even though it hasn\u2019t even been a week, she misses her.</p>\n<p>When she finally gets home, she calls for Po, but he doesn\u2019t come. She quirks her eyebrows, setting her suitcase in the hallway and walking into the living room. He\u2019s just lying on his bed with his ears perked up, staring at her.</p>\n<p>\u201cDude!\u201d She says, going over and patting his head. \u201cYou\u2019re like, the worst guard dog ever.\u201d</p>\n<p>He just lets out a huff and lays his head back down.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, yeah, I know.\u201d She mutters. She\u2019d be disappointed to see her instead of Chloe, too.</p>\n<p>She unpacks her suitcase and does some laundry, eventually making herself some dinner. It\u2019s the first night she\u2019s been alone in the house since Chloe moved in and it feels weird.</p>\n<p>She knows she lived here alone for about a year before Chloe came, but she honestly can\u2019t remember what she used to do at night when there wasn\u2019t a built-in best friend to watch shitty TV with and talk to all night.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s weird.</p>\n<p>She just hopes the next few days go by fast so Chloe will come home soon.</p>\n<p>//</p>\n<p>Christmas is boring for Beca. She sleeps in and takes Po on his walk and her and Jesse meet up to grab lunch.</p>\n<p>He gives her Frank Ocean\u2019s new album on Vinyl and she gives him a <em>Casablanca</em> poster. They eat burgers and talk about music and the Wachowski movie. In a rare moment of sentimentality (must be the Christmas spirit), Beca gives him a really big hug when they part ways.</p>\n<p>She\u2019s just really glad they\u2019re friends.</p>\n<p>Around eight, she sets up in front of her laptop with the wrapped present Chloe left for her on the dresser. It\u2019s big and square and kind of heavy, and she can\u2019t even begin to guess what it is.</p>\n<p>Her laptop tells her she has an incoming Skype call and she quickly answers it. It\u2019s kind of blurry, but eventually Chloe\u2019s face appears on the screen.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Becs?\u201d</em></p>\n<p>\u201cHey,\u201d Beca says with a small smile. Beca\u2019s memory didn\u2019t do justice to how pretty Chloe looks. \u201cYou\u2019re kind of blurry.\u201d</p>\n<p>Chloe pouts. \u201c<em>You look good on my end.\u201d</em></p>\n<p>Beca smirks. \u201cI look good on every end.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>True that.\u201d</em> Chloe giggles.</p>\n<p>Beca softens, her fingers tapping on her legs. She wishes Chloe were here instead. \u201cHow was your day?\u201d</p>\n<p><em>\u201cUmm</em>,\u201d Chloe shrugs. \u201c<em>It was fine. My mom cooked a lot and made me eat too many cookies.\u201d</em></p>\n<p>\u201cDude, lucky.\u201d Beca\u2019s had Chloe\u2019s mom\u2019s cookies and doesn\u2019t know what Chloe\u2019s complaining about.</p>\n<p><em>\u201cYeah, but get this</em>,\u201d Chloe says, and holds up a book. She can\u2019t really read the title because of the blurriness of the screen. \u201c<em>She also got me this cookbook and expects me to start cooking. And I told her, I was like, \u2018mama, Beca cooks almost every night\u2019 and she told me I better make our engagement real, then.</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>Beca laughs. \u201cShe\u2019s not still being weird about that is she?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Chloe says, rolling her eyes. \u201cShe said she must just be too southern to understand \u2018show biz.\u2019\u201d Chloe makes air-quotes around the words \u2018show biz\u2019. \u201c<em>She said she\u2019s excited for us, and I was like, mama you know it\u2019s not real, and she goes, \u2018I know Chlo, I just like that Beca gal.\u2019 So you can feel good that my mom likes you better than me, probably.\u201d</em></p>\n<p>For some reason, this makes Beca feel insanely proud of herself. She\u2019s usually horrible with parents, but in the few times she met Chloe\u2019s during college, they seemed to hit it off well enough. Chloe\u2019s mom is like the biggest sweetheart ever.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, if she likes me better than she likes you, she\u2019s crazy.\u201d Beca\u2019s eyes go wide. \u201cDon\u2019t tell her I said that.\u201d</p>\n<p><em>\u201cOkay</em>.\u201d The call focuses slightly more and Chloe comes in a little clearer. <em>\u201cSo not that I\u2019m not enjoying talking to you, but can we please open these now?\u201d</em> Chloe holds up the wrapped present Beca left her. <em>\u201cI\u2019m dying here.\u201d</em></p>\n<p>Beca snorts. \u201cYeah, okay. You first.\u201d</p>\n<p>Chloe beams. <em>\u201cShould I try to guess.\u201d</em></p>\n<p>\u201cNo.\u201d Beca rolls her eyes. \u201cYou won\u2019t.\u201d</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cIs it a mix-cd?\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u201cI said you won\u2019t be able to.\u201d Beca shakes her head in amusement. She knows Chloe\u2019s just being a shit-head. That size of present is clearly not a CD.</p>\n<p>Chloe sticks her tongue out. <em>\u201cFine, fine</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>Beca watches as Chloe begins to unwrap, and she holds her breath in anticipation. Chloe pulls out the sweatshirt Beca got her and holds it up to the camera.</p>\n<p><em>\u201cOh my God, Becs, where did you get this?!\u201d</em> Beca exhales through a smile. It\u2019s just a green Barden Bellas hoodie that says BEALE on the back, but she hoped Chloe wouldn\u2019t think it was lame or ugly or something.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe Bellas started doing them this year and I got Em to make you one.\u201d</p>\n<p><em>\u201cWell, I love it!\u201d</em> Chloe grins and sets it aside before holding up the second part of her present. Beca taps her fingers on her legs again.</p>\n<p>She knows Chloe will like it, she just really hates the anticipation of giving presents. Especially sappy ones.</p>\n<p><em>\u201cBeca,\u201d</em> Chloe says, her voice dipping lowly. <em>\u201cOh my God.\u201d</em></p>\n<p>Chloe holds the frame up, a collage of pictures of them from their first time winning nationals to them in Copenhagen to that weird drunk selfie they took that Chloe is obsessed with.</p>\n<p>\u201cI figured we could hang it up in the hallway or the living room or something.\u201d Beca shrugs.</p>\n<p>Chloe sniffles a little. \u201c<em>It\u2019s perfect</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh my God, dude, please don\u2019t cry!\u201d Beca grins and leans toward the camera. \u201cI swear if you cry I\u2019m hanging up.\u201d</p>\n<p>Chloe shoots her a watery smile. \u201c<em>You know I get emotional about these things.\u201d</em></p>\n<p>Beca holds her hands up. \u201cWell stop!\u201d She laughs and Chloe crinkles her nose cutely.</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cOkay, okay. Open yours now.\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u201cAlright.\u201d Beca grabs the present and pulls it onto her lap. She looks at Chloe on the screen one more time before sliding her finger under the wrapping paper. She bites her lip as she pulls the paper off what appears to be a binder-type scrapbook thing.</p>\n<p>She opens it, her eyes scanning over the first page. It\u2019s a short blurb from that dumb a cappella talk show that used to do reports on them about Beca leading them to win Worlds. She smiles a little and turns the page.</p>\n<p>The next page is a tiny one-line header about the label in L.A. signing her. Underneath is a bigger article that talks about her EP.</p>\n<p>She keeps turning the pages, each one revealing an article or pictures that show her journey from unknown wannabe producer to who she is today, highlighting all of her accomplishments.</p>\n<p>Her throat feels thick and now she\u2019s embarrassed because <em>she\u2019s</em> getting emotional.</p>\n<p>\u201cChlo, this is.. this...\u201d She looks up to see Chloe beaming at her. \u201cI don\u2019t even have words for this. Where did you <em>find</em> all these?\u201d</p>\n<p>Chloe smiles coyly. \u201c<em>I\u2019m amazing, obviously.\u201d</em></p>\n<p>\u201cObviously,\u201d Beca repeats, still in awe. \u201cThis must\u2019ve taken you forever.\u201d</p>\n<p>Chloe shrugs. \u201c<em>It was worth it. Honestly I almost cried like five times making that. You\u2019ve done some amazing things.\u201d</em></p>\n<p>Beca inhales and holds her breath. She really doesn\u2019t want to cry. Chloe seems to understand.</p>\n<p><em>\u201cI\u2019m so proud of you, Beca</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>Beca nods, looking up at the ceiling, her eyes watery. \u201cUh.\u201d She sniffles. \u201cThanks. For this and\u2026\u201d She exhales roughly. \u201cJust thanks for everything.\u201d</p>\n<p>Chloe smiles fondly at her. \u201c<em>Of course.\u201d</em></p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2026\u201d Beca clears her throat, trying to shake off the emotion welling inside her. \u201cI couldn\u2019t have done this without you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Chloe rolls her eyes. <em>\u201cYes you could have.</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>Beca chokes out a laugh. \u201cYeah, maybe. But it really would\u2019ve sucked.\u201d</p>\n<p>Chloe grins. <em>\u201cMerry Christmas, Becs.\u201d</em></p>\n<p>\u201cMerry Christmas, Chlo.\u201d Beca feels herself smiling hugely and she know she probably looks like an emotional sap right now, but she doesn\u2019t care very much for once.</p>\n<p>Chloe\u2019s eyes crinkle with happiness and it makes Beca\u2019s heart feel too-full. \u201c<em>Give Po a big hug for me and I\u2019ll see you in a few days, okay?\u201d</em></p>\n<p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Beca nods. \u201cBye. I love you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Chloe blinks at her for a few seconds. \u201c<em>I love you, too. See you soon.\u201d </em>\u00a0She blows Beca a kiss and hangs up, and Beca\u2019s laptop goes back to the homescreen.</p>\n<p>She flips through the scrapbook a few more times, reading all the articles and looking at the pictures. Finally she closes it and sets it on the mantle of the fireplace so she can look at it whenever.</p>\n<p>She lets Po out one last time and gets ready for bed. When she finally crawls under the covers and settles on her back in the dark, she breathes deeply, feeling her chest move up and down with every breath.</p>\n<p>She closes her eyes, but even in the darkness, she sees Chloe\u2019s soft eyes and happy smile, and she lets them lead her into sleep.</p>\n<p>//</p>\n<p>\u00a0The day after Christmas, Beca takes Po on an extra long walk on the beach. Halfway through, she sits down on the sand to watch the sunset. Po plops down next to her with an exaggerated groan.</p>\n<p>She pulls her knees up to her chest, watching as sun sets the ocean on fire, the waves cascading into glowing embers of orange and yellow before the sun finally dips below the horizon. She sends a snapchat of it to Chloe. <em>Wish you were here</em>.</p>\n<p>She knows it\u2019s to be expected, but she misses Chloe a lot. And like, the past few days, she can\u2019t stop thinking about how much she misses her.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a spark of lightning in the distance, followed by a crash of thunder, and she stands up, brushing the sand off her legs and pulling lightly on Po\u2019s leash. It\u2019s getting dark anyway and she doesn\u2019t want to be stuck outside if it ends up raining.</p>\n<p>By the time they get home, raindrops have started to splatter on the pavement and Beca hurries inside to close all of the windows she\u2019d left open.</p>\n<p>She\u2019s eating dinner when the sky starts rumbling louder. Po lets out a small whine from the living room. Beca rolls her eyes at him.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s just thunder, you big baby.\u201d</p>\n<p>He whines again.</p>\n<p>She finishes her dinner and does the dishes, finally sitting down to watch some TV before she goes to bed. The storm has picked up and she turns up the volume of the TV so she can hear it above the rain slapping against the concrete outside.</p>\n<p>Halfway through an episode of <em>Grey\u2019s Anatomy</em> (Chloe got her hooked on it), a flash of lightning illuminates the room, causing Beca\u2019s heart to jump in her chest. A second later, thunder shakes the house, echoing off the walls.</p>\n<p>Po howls, making Beca drop her phone, and shoots off into the hallway. She hears his claws scratch at the hardwood floor before he disappears into Chloe\u2019s bedroom.</p>\n<p>Beca frowns, and tries to ignore it, but eventually she feels too bad. Sighing, she stands up and pads down the hall after the dog.</p>\n<p>\u201cPo?\u201d</p>\n<p>She pokes her head into Chloe\u2019s room, but doesn\u2019t see him. She quirks her eyebrows because she swore he came in here.</p>\n<p>She\u2019s about to go check in her room when she hears a low whine come from under the bed. She snorts and lies down on her stomach, head turned so she can peer under the mattress. Sure enough, there\u2019s Po, curled in a ball, his head on his paws and tail quivering.</p>\n<p>\u201cDude,\u201d she chuckles. \u201cIt\u2019s just thunder.\u201d</p>\n<p>His eyes stare back at her from their dark hiding spot. She reaches her hand under the bed and taps one of his paws.</p>\n<p>\u201cCome out from there.\u201d</p>\n<p>She spends five minutes trying to coax him out, but he clearly doesn\u2019t want to leave his safe place. She sits up and leans her back against the bed, waiting it out. She looks around the room, taking in all of Chloe\u2019s pictures. Some of Aubrey, some of her parents. Chloe and the Bellas. Chloe and Beca.</p>\n<p>Finally, she hears shuffling, and seconds later, Po crawls out from under the bed. He leans into her, practically climbing in her lap and laying his head on her legs. She scratches behind his ears and he lets out the saddest, most pitiful groan she\u2019s ever heard.</p>\n<p>She guesses she gets it.</p>\n<p>\u201cI know, buddy,\u201d she says, looking back at the pictures of her and Chloe.</p>\n<p>\u201cI miss her, too.\u201d</p>\n<p>//</p>\n<p>Beca\u2019s driving when her thoughts finally manage to catch up with her brain.</p>\n<p>She\u2019s coming back from the grocery store after getting food for dinner for when Chloe comes home tomorrow. She\u2019s blasting the radio, some station on Sirius that Chloe likes because it does this segment where it plays an artist\u2019s most recent hit then follows it up with a popular past single that they had.</p>\n<p>The DJs just played Ellie Goulding\u2019s new song, some collaboration with Pitbull that Beca is pretty meh about, and it quickly fades into one of her older songs that Beca hasn\u2019t heard in forever.</p>\n<p>She grins a little, turning up the volume, and humming to the opening chords of Love Me Like You Do. Chloe used to be obsessed with this song.</p>\n<p>She sings along as the song slows slightly and there\u2019s a little pause after the bridge and the chorus. Beca loves that pause. She lives for that pause.</p>\n<p>That pause feels like the song is going to tear you down and build you up all within a beat. It makes her think of winning Worlds and moving to L.A. and having her songs on the radio. It makes her think of Chloe coming here and moving in together, and getting Po and how Chloe\u2019s eyes shine when they look at Beca.</p>\n<p>That pause makes her think of every time Chloe\u2019s made her feel larger-than-life, like her dreams are not only possible, but right there for the taking.</p>\n<p>In that pause, Beca lets out a breath, her eyes widening and fingers gripping the steering wheel harder.</p>\n<p>She thinks back to Chloe\u2019s choir concert and that girl who asked for her autograph and how Chloe fills up all of the spaces inside her that she didn\u2019t even know existed until Chloe was there.</p>\n<p>Beca finally realizes what her dumb brain has been trying to tell her for <em>weeks</em>.</p>\n<p>She\u2019s in love with Chloe Beale.</p>\n<p>//</p>\n<p>Beca\u2019s leaning against her car, sunglasses on and arms crossed, when Chloe walks out of the airport. She smiles when she sees Chloe, all teeth and happiness.</p>\n<p>She looks so cool and so beautiful that Chloe stops dead in her tracks.</p>\n<p>Beca steps away from the car, head tilting to the side questioningly, and Chloe moves again. In a second, she\u2019s got her arms wrapped around Beca, picking her up and swinging her around, her suitcase forgotten next to the car.</p>\n<p>\u201cPut me down, you nerd!\u201d But Beca is laughing and the sound makes Chloe feel bubbly and drunk.</p>\n<p>She sets Beca back on her feet and leans away from her, taking Beca\u2019s cheeks between her palms. \u201cOh my God, I missed you so much. I forgot how tiny you are.\u201d</p>\n<p>Beca tries to scowl, but Chloe\u2019s hands are still on her cheeks, preventing her mouth from doing anything but puckering like a fish. Chloe giggles and lets go.</p>\n<p>\u201cHow was your flight,\u201d Beca asks and Chloe shrugs.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt was nice. I slept the whole time.\u201d</p>\n<p>Beca nods and shoots her a smile. \u201cNice.\u201d She grabs Chloe\u2019s suitcase.</p>\n<p>\u201cI can get it,\u201d Chloe says, stepping forward, but Beca ignores her, and lifts it into the trunk. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCourse.\u201d Beca grins at her. \u201cReady to go?\u201d</p>\n<p>They get in the car and Beca merges back into traffic. She asks Chloe more about her holiday and Chloe tells her about her mom and dad surprising her with a new pair of nice heels and how her grandma wouldn\u2019t stop falling asleep at dinner.</p>\n<p>Beca won\u2019t stop laughing and Chloe thinks she looks really free and happy. Chloe thinks her heart might grow wings at the sight, because it won\u2019t stop trying to beat its way out of her chest.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo,\u201d Beca says when they\u2019re on the freeway. \u201cDo you want to go to this New Year\u2019s Eve party with me? The label is throwing it at this fancy hotel and there\u2019s dinner and a party after.\u201d She glances over at Chloe and shrugs. \u201cYou can wear your new heels.\u201d</p>\n<p>Chloe grins because duh. \u201cI\u2019d love to.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCool, because I didn\u2019t want to say so, but you kind of have to.\u201d Chloe looks at Beca questioningly and Beca\u2019s lips pull up a little. She waves her left hand in the air. \u201cYou know, our last outing as fianc\u00e9es.\u201d Beca frowns slightly. \u201cOr you know. Whatever.\u201d</p>\n<p>Chloe nods, trying not to feel disappointed. It doesn\u2019t matter, she tells herself. Even if she likes Beca as more than friends, they couldn\u2019t keep this engagement thing up forever.</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she says, but Beca must hear the sudden dip in her tone because she glances over at Chloe again. She tentatively reaches over and squeezes Chloe\u2019s hand across the gear shift. Chloe looks down in surprise because she\u2019s not sure Beca\u2019s ever initiated their handholding before.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be fun.\u201d Beca says. \u201cWell, probably. I mean, I heard Jessie J was going to be there.\u201d</p>\n<p>That does cheer Chloe up a little bit. She loves Jessie J.</p>\n<p>They spend the rest of the drive back home speculating about which celebrities will be at the party. Beca doesn\u2019t let go of her hand the whole time.</p>\n<p>//</p>\n<p>\u201cI need your help with something.\u201d</p>\n<p>It\u2019s the hardest sentence Beca\u2019s ever said, but at least she\u2019s saying it to Jesse so he doesn\u2019t really notice that she\u2019s visibly cringing.</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Jesse responds, absentmindedly adjusting the brightness on his laptop. They\u2019re supposed to be working on the movie score, but she\u2019s a little preoccupied right now.</p>\n<p>\u201cI think I\u2019m in love with Chloe.\u201d</p>\n<p>There. She said it out loud. It wasn\u2019t that hard. Not that she hadn\u2019t practiced saying the words to herself the whole drive over to Jesse\u2019s place.</p>\n<p>Jesse doesn\u2019t seem to realize this is a pivotal moment for Beca\u2019s stunted emotional development and just keeps fiddling with his laptop. \u201cYeah, I know dude. You guys are engaged, remember?\u201d</p>\n<p>She groans and taps the table with her fingers. \u201cYeah, about that\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>Jesse finally looks up at her. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re not actually engaged.\u201d She raises her eyebrows as if to say sorry, but he kind of just stares at her.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p>\n<p>She nods. \u201cWe\u2019re not engaged. Umm. Chloe tweeted that we were from my account that night and we were drunk and Lindsey had a hissy fit and basically the label wouldn\u2019t let me take it back for PR reasons so we had to go along with it and we couldn\u2019t tell anyone and now I don\u2019t know what to do, Jesse, help!\u201d</p>\n<p>His eyes kept growing wider as she kept talking and now they\u2019re the size of salad plates. She feels everything bubble inside her like a geyser of emotions waiting to explode.</p>\n<p>\u201cWait, you haven\u2019t been engaged this whole time?\u201d He makes this face that looks like he feels slightly betrayed, but mostly just really confused.</p>\n<p>Beca shakes her head. \u201cNo. I\u2019m sorry. Lindsey wouldn\u2019t let us tell you.\u201d She shrugs. \u201cWe didn\u2019t tell anyone but our families.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jesse leans back in his chair and crosses his arms. He doesn\u2019t say anything for a minute and she just watches him. Finally, he sighs.</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay, well I\u2019m kind of mad about that, but I would like to rewind for a second.\u201d He uncrosses his arms. \u201cSo you are <em>not</em> engaged, but you <em>are </em>in love with Chloe?\u201d</p>\n<p>She bites her lip and wishes she wasn\u2019t blushing. \u201cYeah.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cRight.\u201d Jesse rubs his eyes for a second. Then nods at her like it\u2019s obvious. \u201cOkay, so have you told her?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUmm.\u201d Beca feels an overwhelming sense of terror at the thought. \u201c<em>No</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d He raises his eyebrows in surprise. \u201cDude, she loves you, too.\u201d</p>\n<p>Beca stares at him. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p>\n<p>He shakes his head, mouth falling open in a laugh. \u201cOh my God, the two of you are more clueless than Cher and Josh.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWho?\u201d</p>\n<p>He throws his hands in the air. \u201cWe literally watched this movie <em>together</em> over Thanksgiving!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSorry?\u201d She shrugs.</p>\n<p>Jesse shakes his head again. \u201cOkay, well never mind. Dude. Chloe\u2019s in love with you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Beca stares at him. \u201cReally?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cObviously.\u201d He shoots her this condescending <em>duh, Beca</em> look. She scowls. \u201cShe\u2019s been in love with you since Barden.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo way.\u201d Beca scowls in denial.</p>\n<p>He shrugs. \u201cMaybe she didn\u2019t know it yet, but yeah, dude.\u201d</p>\n<p>Beca still doesn\u2019t believe him, but it doesn\u2019t matter. \u201cOkay, well what do I do. I can\u2019t just <em>tell</em> her.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jesse looks at her like she\u2019s crazy. \u201cYes, you can?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, I can\u2019t!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d He puts his hand on her shoulder and she exhales shakily.</p>\n<p>\u201cBecause, I dunno. What if she <em>doesn\u2019t </em>and what if I fuck it all up?\u201d The thought cuts through her with a flash of heat. Chloe is her <em>best friend</em>. Her family, really. The best person in her life.</p>\n<p>Jesse smiles sympathetically at her. \u201cWell, first, she <em>does</em>. And second, you\u2019re not gonna fuck it up, Becs. This is <em>Chloe</em>. She loves you either way.\u201d</p>\n<p>She wants to argue, but he\u2019s kind of right. Chloe always puts up with her, even when she\u2019s being an asshole or avoiding talking about stuff or busy with work. She\u2019s Chloe\u2019s number one and Chloe is hers.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou can do it,\u201d Jesse says. \u201cAnd then you can have aca-babies together.\u201d He winks exaggeratedly and it causes her to laugh a little. He\u2019s such a loser.</p>\n<p>She guesses she loves him. A lot. Ugh, how annoying.</p>\n<p>Beca nods a little. Maybe she can do it.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd hey,\u201d Jesse says. \u201cIf not, then we can spend your period of imminent heartbreak watching bad romcoms and eating ice cream.\u201d</p>\n<p>She grimaces at the thought. \u201cYeah. No thanks.\u201d</p>\n<p>He laughs and leans over to give her hug. She sinks into it, embracing his familiar <em>Jesse</em>-<em>smell</em> and thinking that maybe he\u2019s right.</p>\n<p>She can do it.</p>\n<p>//</p>\n<p>She can\u2019t do it.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s just a fact. The night passes and New Year\u2019s Eve comes and Beca has plenty of opportunities to tell Chloe she loves her, but she can\u2019t.</p>\n<p>Every time she thinks about saying something, her heart starts beating so hard she thinks she\u2019s going into cardiac arrest and her whole body feels like she took a lava bath it\u2019s so hot.</p>\n<p>It might be easier, Beca thinks as she watches Chloe finish getting ready for the night, if Chloe didn\u2019t look like she belonged on the cover of a magazine.</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you think I did my eyes too smoky?\u201d Chloe peers closer into the mirror, but she\u2019s clearly talking to Beca.</p>\n<p>Beca makes some kind of sound that passes for a <em>no</em>, but honestly, she isn\u2019t even sure if her brain is capable of thinking rational thoughts at this point. It seems to keep short-circuiting.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s not her fault. She\u2019s <em>trying</em> to be rational here.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s just that Chloe is wearing this gorgeous strapless blue dress that fits tightly over butt and not much else. Add the heels in and Beca\u2019s pretty sure Chloe\u2019s legs have never looked that long in her life, but they\u2019re tan and strong and Beca\u2019s not staring, she\u2019s <em>not</em>, it\u2019s just that Chloe is so... <em>hot</em>.</p>\n<p>Which like, duh. Beca\u2019s got eyes. Everyone knows Chloe is hot. When it came to the Bellas, there had been a general consensus among them that Chloe and Stacie were the hottest and when it came down to it, also most willing to exploit that fact to get what they want.</p>\n<p>Beca had seen countless guys eagerly slam a few dollar bills on the bar to buy Chloe drinks, only to have her smile sweetly at them and go back to dancing with Stacie and Jessica and Ashley, sucking her cocktail through a straw and giggling at how <em>easy</em> boys were.</p>\n<p>She must have witnessed it a hundred times. She just never thought <em>she\u2019d</em> be on the receiving end.</p>\n<p>Not that Chloe\u2019s trying to seduce her, but she does keep looking at Beca through hooded eyes for some reason and frankly, Beca\u2019s not even half sure of her own name anymore.</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you ready?\u201d Chloe asks her, shooting her an uncertain look in the mirror, and Beca realizes that <em>fine</em>, maybe she <em>is</em> staring. She blinks a few times and shuts her mouth.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, let\u2019s do this.\u201d</p>\n<p>Chloe grabs her hand and helps her up from her bed, which Beca is grateful for because she really sucks at this whole heel game.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou look nice,\u201d Chloe tells her, smiling gently, and Beca looks down at her simple black dress and shrugs.</p>\n<p>\u201cThanks,\u201d she says, avoiding Chloe\u2019s eyes. \u201cYou look. Uh. Acamazing.\u201d</p>\n<p>Chloe snorts and grins at her skeptically. She puts her hand to Beca\u2019s forehead. \u201cAre you feeling alright? You\u2019re being weird.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo. Yeah.\u201d Beca nods. \u201cNah. I\u2019m yeah. Good. Let\u2019s go.\u201d</p>\n<p>Nailed it.</p>\n<p>They ride to the hotel in a cab because they\u2019re definitely going to be drinking but they didn\u2019t want to actually stay at the hotel because who needs that when they live ten minutes away?</p>\n<p>Beca\u2019s sure that\u2019s going to bite her in the ass when she\u2019s drunk out of her mind and it\u2019s two in the morning, but hey, she\u2019s trying to be responsible here.</p>\n<p>The hotel is pretty nice, Beca guesses, but she\u2019s kind of overwhelmed when they arrive because she spent the whole cab ride trying not to think about how awesome Chloe smells sitting next to her and what if she told Chloe now and then they just ditch this whole thing to stay at home and make out in their sweats.</p>\n<p>But yeah, that doesn\u2019t happen, because of the part where Beca is incapable of expressing her feelings unless it\u2019s in song form or something and that\u2019s just not an option right now, so she follows Chloe to the fancy ballroom and tries not to trip and fall because of her dumb heels.</p>\n<p>The music is already in full-swing by the time they get there even if it\u2019s only 9, but it\u2019s not too loud because the dinner doesn\u2019t officially end until 10:30ish when the countdown to midnight begins.</p>\n<p>They get seated next to a bubbly blonde woman that Beca has never met before which is kind of weird. Beca hates small talk, but Chloe likes it, so she\u2019s grateful when Chloe starts to chat with the woman immediately.</p>\n<p>A waiter comes by and Beca orders a drink because this night is already feeling like a bit too much for her and it hasn\u2019t even really started.</p>\n<p>\u201cDavid will be back in a few minutes,\u201d the blonde, Maggie she introduced herself as, says about her date. \u201cHe\u2019s just run off to the little boy\u2019s right quick.\u201d</p>\n<p>Beca almost snorts, but manages to hide it behind a cough. She feels Chloe\u2019s hand clamp down on her knee, clearly telling her to be nice.</p>\n<p>\u201cIs David your husband?\u201d Chloe asks, turning her southern sweetheart smile on the woman. Beca bites down her smirk.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, no. We\u2019re just friends.\u201d Maggie winks suggestively. Thankfully, the waiter arrives with Beca\u2019s drink at that moment, and she eagerly takes a sip. It\u2019s too strong. Excellent.</p>\n<p>\u201cNow, are you two\u2026\u201d Maggie points between them and Chloe makes eye contact with Beca for a second before turning back to the woman.</p>\n<p>She smiles brightly. \u201cOh, yes. Beca and I are engaged.\u201d</p>\n<p>The word does weird things to Beca\u2019s stomach. She takes another sip of her drink.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh congratulations!\u201d Maggie beams at them. At that moment, Maggie\u2019s <em>friend</em> comes back, sitting down next to her and putting his arm around the back of her chair.</p>\n<p>Beca glances up at him before doing a double take. She chokes on her drink.</p>\n<p>Chloe\u2019s hand immediately starts rubbing her back until she stops coughing. Maggie and the guy are looking at her and she\u2019s turning really red, she can feel it, but <em>oh my God</em>.</p>\n<p>\u201cDavid?\u201d She says, and it\u2019s like her first word in ten minutes and Maggie looks shocked that she can even speak. \u201cDavid Guetta?\u201d</p>\n<p>Chloe\u2019s hand freezes on her back and Beca thinks this is quite possibly the strangest and most amazing moment of her life.</p>\n<p>\u201cHello,\u201d he says politely, chuckling slightly. \u201cDidn\u2019t mean to surprise you, there.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo sorry, sorry,\u201d Beca says, eyes wide. \u201cIt\u2019s just.\u201d She looks at Chloe and Chloe stares back. \u201cWe, umm. Sort of met because of your song.\u201d</p>\n<p>David Guetta (ohmygod it\u2019s David Guetta) smiles at them eagerly. \u201cIs that so?\u201d</p>\n<p>Beca kind of dies because he\u2019s right there, and he\u2019s smiling and he\u2019s so French and wearing leather and just. Beca is kind of fangirling.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe used to sing in college,\u201d Chloe chimes in. \u201cWell, we still sing. But Beca used to sing in the shower and I heard her singing Titanium so I obviously had to meet her.\u201d</p>\n<p>Beca snorts. \u201cShe stormed in on me and forced me to sing a duet with her while we were naked.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTitanium is my lady jam!\u201d</p>\n<p>Beca blinks. Chloe looks embarrassed for once in her life. David Guetta smiles uncertainly like he\u2019s really confused, but thinks they\u2019re cute.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u201cThey\u2019re engaged, Dave,\u201d Maggie says and Beca becomes really confused about their relationship, but hey, whatever.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d David Guetta says. \u201cThis is wonderful. Congratulations!\u201d</p>\n<p>Chloe and Beca exchange giant grins. \u201cThank you,\u201d Chloe says.</p>\n<p>At this point it\u2019s announced that dinner is ready to be served buffet style. Chloe helps Beca up from her chair (stupid heels) and drags her to get food. Beca tries not to think about how they\u2019re holding hands.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh my God,\u201d Chloe whispers.</p>\n<p>\u201cI know. I know.\u201d Beca\u2019s still kind of freaking out.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat was David Guetta.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI told him Titanium was my lady jam!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, that\u2019s embarrassing.\u201d</p>\n<p>Chloe swats her playfully and lets go of her hand so they can get food. \u201cHe\u2019s so cute,\u201d Chloe says. \u201cI didn\u2019t know he was French Or like. Old.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh really?\u201d Beca frowns down at the food. Some unrecognizable pasta dish. She hopes it\u2019s good and not weird. \u201cWhat do you think the deal with that Maggie chick is?\u201d</p>\n<p>Chloe shrugs as she takes some of the pasta dish, too. \u201cWho knows. Sleeping together, maybe.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWeird\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>They smile at each other and head back to their table. Chloe makes more small talk with Maggie, but Beca and David Guetta kind of just sit there and shove food in their faces. The pasta ends up being pretty good, thankfully.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo,\u201d Maggie says eventually. \u201cI have to ask because I\u2019m just such a sap. How did y\u2019all know it was meant to be?\u201d</p>\n<p>Beca blinks and stops chewing. She glances at Chloe and they make brief eye contact before Chloe looks away.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell,\u201d Chloe says, clearing her throat. \u201cBeca is amazing. Have you heard her album <em>On the Rocks</em>?\u201d Maggie shakes her head. \u201cOh, well, it\u2019s just so good. She\u2019s so talented.\u201d</p>\n<p>Beca flushes and sets down her fork. She\u2019s staring, she knows it, but Chloe\u2019s uncharacteristically avoiding her eyes.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ve known each other for a long time and Beca\u2019s my best friend.\u201d Chloe shrugs like it\u2019s obvious. \u201cShe makes me laugh and she lets me see parts of her that nobody else gets to see. When I wake up, I\u2019m happy she\u2019s who I get to talk to first and when I\u2019ve had a long day, Beca\u2019s always there at the end to make me feel better. She\u2019s my best friend,\u201d Chloe repeats and finally meets Beca\u2019s eyes with a shy smile.</p>\n<p>Beca feels herself melt a little. She gives Chloe a small smile back.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s so sweet.\u201d Maggie claps excitedly and turns to Beca. \u201cAnd how about you, sweetie? How\u2019d you know Chloe here was the one?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh.\u201d Beca says, eyes widening at being put on the spot. \u201cUh. Me?\u201d</p>\n<p>Maggie nods at her enthusiastically and Beca bites her lip. Maybe she can tell Chloe now. Just you know, without actually telling her.</p>\n<p>Totally foolproof logic here.</p>\n<p>\u201cUmm.\u201d Beca clears her throat. \u201cI mean. That\u2019s easy.\u201d She smiles to herself because it is. There\u2019s a million reasons why she loves Chloe. \u201cChloe is the kindest person I\u2019ve ever met. And she\u2019s gorgeous, obviously, you don\u2019t need me to tell you that.\u201d</p>\n<p>Chloe\u2019s looking at her intensely, like staring into her eyes, and Beca can\u2019t look away.</p>\n<p>\u201cChloe makes me better,\u201d she continues, the blue of Chloe\u2019s eyes taking over her entire vision. \u201cAnd uh, she makes me feel like I can do anything. She\u2019s the best kind of song, one you can listen to over and over, but it just gets better every time.\u201d Beca smiles a little, lifting one of her shoulders in a shrug. \u201cAnd I, uh. I love her. A lot.\u201d</p>\n<p>Chloe won\u2019t stop looking at her with these wide eyes and Beca\u2019s hypnotized because she just essentially told Chloe how she feels and she thinks Chloe <em>knows</em>, but she\u2019s not saying anything.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, that\u2019s just beautiful,\u201d Maggie says, and Beca finally glances away from Chloe to see the woman clutching her chest dramatically. \u201cAren\u2019t they a beautiful couple, Dave?\u201d</p>\n<p>Beca snorts, she can\u2019t help it. David Guetta just nods at them politely.</p>\n<p>\u201cI umm,\u201d Chloe says. \u201cI have to go to the restroom. Excuse me.\u201d She smiles at them and Beca makes a face as if to ask if she wants her to come with, but Chloe just shakes her head with a small smile.</p>\n<p>She doesn\u2019t know what that\u2019s about, but now she\u2019s left sitting at a table alone with Maggie and David Guetta, and yeah this is the weirdest night. Thankfully, it\u2019s at this point that she hears a familiar voice.</p>\n<p>\u201cBecaw!\u201d</p>\n<p>She whips around, just as Jesse flops down into the seat Chloe vacated. \u201cOh my God,\u201d she hisses, feeling relief swell inside her. \u201cThank God you\u2019re here.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jesse just grins that excited boy-next-door smile. \u201cThanks for putting me on the list.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, no problem.\u201d She gestures to the people at the table. \u201cUh, Jesse this is Maggie. And David Guetta.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jesse politely smiles. \u201cNice to meet you.\u201d Then he turns to Beca, which slightly offends her. Like is he not even a little excited about David Guetta? \u201cWhere\u2019s Chloe?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIn the bathroom.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDid you tell her?\u201d He looks like an eager puppy.</p>\n<p>She shrugs. \u201cKind of?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cKind of?\u201d</p>\n<p>She\u2019s about to quietly tell him, but then Chloe comes back. \u201cOh, hey Jesse.\u201d Chloe smiles at him, but Beca thinks Chloe looks\u2026 disappointed? Maybe.</p>\n<p>\u201cHi, Chloe!\u201d Jesse waves and waggles his eyebrows at Beca. She wants to smack him.</p>\n<p>At this point, dinner is finishing up and the music is getting louder. Beca check her watch and sees that it\u2019s almost eleven.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou guys want to dance?\u201d Jesse asks, and Chloe and Beca exchange a look.</p>\n<p>\u201cSure,\u201d Chloe says. She grabs Beca\u2019s hand and pulls her to the dance floor. Jesse goes to get them all drinks.</p>\n<p>Beca does have to say one thing for fancy parties thrown by a record label. They play really awesome dance music.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s not long before she\u2019s hot and sweaty from dancing and drinking. Her skin feels on fire, either from too much vodka or from that thing Chloe keeps doing with her hips which is just <em>unfair</em>. Chloe catches her staring and winks.</p>\n<p>Beca\u2019s neck burns.</p>\n<p>Jesse\u2019s dancing with some girl and Chloe\u2019s got her hands on Beca\u2019s hips, their bodies flushed together, and for a second Beca can\u2019t breathe.</p>\n<p>She rests her forehead against Chloe\u2019s and inhales sharply.</p>\n<p>The song fades out and the DJ reminds them that there\u2019s only a few minutes until midnight. Beca glances at the feed of Times Square being projected onto the wall. Three minutes and counting.</p>\n<p>Chloe\u2019s fingers dig into her hips and Beca feels dizzy.</p>\n<p>She needs some air.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll be right back,\u201d she says into Chloe\u2019s ear. Chloe looks confused, but nods, and Beca makes her way to the edge of the room and out onto one of the many balconies that jut out from the hotel.</p>\n<p>The night air hits her face and she takes in a cool breath, leaning over the balcony railing.</p>\n<p>Everything stops spinning and she feels her shoulders relax.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey,\u201d a voice says from behind her and she doesn\u2019t need to turn around to know it\u2019s Chloe. \u201cYou okay?\u201d</p>\n<p>Beca nods. \u201cYeah. I just got too hot in there.\u201d</p>\n<p>Chloe comes to stand next to her at the railing. Their shoulders brush.\u00a0 Beca\u2019s insides twist.</p>\n<p>They stare down at the city, watching the rush of cars below them and see all the people in the street clapping and yelling happily.</p>\n<p>Inside the hotel, a countdown starts up and Beca knows they should go back inside to watch the ball drop and to find Jesse, but the air feels so good and it\u2019s nice and quiet in their little bubble.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe should probably go inside,\u201d Beca says as the countdown hits ten seconds. Chloe meets her eyes, and that intensity is back, the one that hypnotizes Beca.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Chloe whispers as the countdown reaches five seconds. \u201cProbably.\u201d</p>\n<p>Neither of them move.</p>\n<p>Then Chloe leans forward, her hand coming up to cup Beca\u2019s cheek, and Beca closes her eyes.</p>\n<p>She hears someone inside shout HAPPY NEW YEAR but Chloe\u2019s lips are on hers, soft but sure, and Beca\u2019s kissing back. She hears fireworks pop in the distance, but Beca\u2019s mouth tingles as it moves with Chloe\u2019s, and her heart is pounding loud in her ears.</p>\n<p>Chloe pulls back and Beca blinks her eyes open.</p>\n<p>She feels giddy, but her mouth always says things before she thinks them, and she\u2019s drunk and Chloe just <em>kissed her</em>.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat was that for?\u201d She whispers.</p>\n<p>Chloe smiles fondly at her and moves Beca\u2019s hair out of her face. \u201cDidn\u2019t you know? On New Year\u2019s Eve, you\u2019re supposed to kiss someone you love into the New Year. It\u2019s good luck.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSomeone you love?\u201d Beca asks, her heartbeat still loud in her ears.</p>\n<p>Chloe nods, and shoots Beca this beautiful smile that makes her stomach flip.</p>\n<p>\u201cAbout that. Chloe I have to tell you something.\u201d Chloe bites her lip and Beca tries to formulate the right words. \u201cI know that we said all that stuff about the engagement back there with those people. But like. I know the engagement is fake, so that stuff probably didn\u2019t mean anything, right?\u201d She watches as Chloe\u2019s face falls, and this is not going the way Beca expected and she\u2019s saying all the wrong words and she\u2019s just so <em>bad</em> at this.</p>\n<p>She tries to continue, to tell Chloe that she actually <em>did</em> mean it, but suddenly Jesse is there and blowing a noisemaker in between them.</p>\n<p>\u201cHappy New Year guys!\u201d</p>\n<p>Beca could punch him, honestly. For someone who is supposed to be her wingman, he\u2019s doing a really great job of having horrible fucking timing.</p>\n<p>Chloe slides her eyes over to Beca\u2019s and they look really sad and hurt and Beca seriously is going to kill Jesse.</p>\n<p>He blows the noisemaker again and Beca grabs it.</p>\n<p>\u201cDude!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d He grins drunkenly, and looks between them with a smile. \u201cWhy aren\u2019t you inside? We should be drinking champagne and toasting our successes!\u201d</p>\n<p>Beca grits her teeth. \u201cOkay, you go and we\u2019ll be inside in a minute.\u201d She looks at him pointedly and he seems to get the message.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh. <em>Oh</em>.\u201d He backs away. \u201cOkay, I\u2019ll just go get us champagne.\u201d</p>\n<p>Beca pinches her nose until he disappears before turning back to Chloe.</p>\n<p>\u201cChlo \u2013 \u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUmm.\u201d Chloe looks like kicked puppy and Beca hates herself. \u201cI have to go to the bathroom, Becs. I\u2019ll meet you, okay?\u201d</p>\n<p>Beca panics. \u201cChloe!\u201d</p>\n<p>But Chloe is already walking away and Beca lets her head fall back with an exasperated groan.</p>\n<p>Why can\u2019t she do anything right?</p>\n<p>She goes back inside and finds Jesse at the bar. \u201cDude! I was about to tell her!\u201d</p>\n<p>He holds his hands up apologetically. \u201cSorry, I didn\u2019t know!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, well. Fuck you, man.\u201d She grabs one of his glasses of champagne and knock it back. She feels her phone vibrate and she pulls it out of her bra.</p>\n<p><strong>Chloe (12:09pm): </strong>Hey, I\u2019ll meet you at home. Not feeling well.</p>\n<p>\u201cFuck,\u201d Beca hisses, slamming her glass back down on the bar. She slides out of her heels (stupid heels) and runs out of the ballroom and through the hotel lobby. She knows she probably looks ridiculous, but she doesn\u2019t care.</p>\n<p>She pushes out of the hotel, looking around for the cab line, for a flash of red hair, for <em>anything</em>.</p>\n<p>But Chloe is already gone.</p>\n<p>Beca curses and slips her heel back on. She walks back to the ballroom and finds Jesse still at the bar.</p>\n<p>\u201cShe leave?\u201d He asks and he at least has the decency to look sad and guilty.</p>\n<p>Beca nods. \u201cYeah. And now I probably fucked it up forever.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jesse shakes his head. \u201cNo way dude. This is just like the movies! You have to run after her, Becs! Go get your girl!\u201d</p>\n<p>Beca scowls. \u201cThis isn\u2019t the movies, Jess.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d he says, a smile growing on his face. \u201cThis is better.\u201d</p>\n<p>She looks at him skeptically, but he just nods like a crazy person.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis is real.\u201d</p>\n<p>//</p>\n<p>Chloe wakes up to a hangover.</p>\n<p>An emotional hangover.</p>\n<p>She really didn\u2019t drink that much last night, but she does feel like she had her heart ripped out and torn in two.</p>\n<p>She groans and rolls over, trying to get back to sleep, but she vaguely hears a familiar loud thumping noise. She peeks her eyes open and checks the clock, her face twisting in confusion.</p>\n<p>Why is Beca in her studio at seven in the morning?</p>\n<p>She wishes it didn\u2019t, because she\u2019s still kind of sad, but her curiosity gets the better of her. She pushes out of bed, first stopping by the bathroom to pee and brush her teeth, and opens her door.</p>\n<p>Sure enough, Beca\u2019s studio light is on.</p>\n<p>She glances in briefly, but doesn\u2019t see Beca, which is weird. She steps into the hallway and sticks her head in the studio door, eyebrows knitting in confusion when she sees Beca sitting on the floor.</p>\n<p>Beca\u2019s still in her dress from the night before, laptop balanced on her upright knees. She\u2019s not working on anything, just listening.</p>\n<p>Chloe listens for a second, her heart beating to the bass of the song, a mashup of Titanium and Ellie Goulding\u2019s Love Me Like You Do that she\u2019s never heard before.</p>\n<p>She likes it and it pulls at her heart as it ends, but Beca must have it on repeat because it starts playing again.</p>\n<p>Chloe clears her throat. \u201cHey.\u201d</p>\n<p>Beca\u2019s head snaps up to look at her and Chloe steps into the room. \u201cHi,\u201d Beca says, and Chloe\u2019s not sure, but she seems shy.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Chloe shifts on her feet and stares down at Beca. \u201cWhy are you still in your dress?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOh.\u201d Beca looks down at her outfit like she hadn\u2019t even noticed. \u201cI umm. Just had this stuck in my head and needed to get it out.\u201d She gestures at the laptop.</p>\n<p>Chloe quirks her eyebrows in confusion. \u201cDid you not sleep?\u201d</p>\n<p>Beca shakes her head. \u201cNo.\u201d She shrugs and looks up at Chloe and Chloe realizes Beca isn\u2019t shy right now. She\u2019s nervous. \u201cCan I talk to you?\u201d</p>\n<p>Chloe doesn\u2019t really want to talk, she already had her heart broken, but this is <em>Beca</em> and Chloe\u2019s not going to say no. She moves over next to her and slides down the wall so they\u2019re sitting side-by-side.</p>\n<p>The song is still playing and Beca taps on her knees like she can\u2019t keep her hands still. \u201cAbout last night,\u201d she starts and Chloe feels panic rise in her throat.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to explain,\u201d Chloe says, but Beca shakes her head.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, I do.\u201d She glances at Chloe briefly before looking down at her lap and sighing. \u201cI fucked up last night.\u201d</p>\n<p>Chloe bites her lip curiously, but doesn\u2019t say anything. She hopes Beca isn\u2019t about to apologize, but not take back what she said. Chloe can\u2019t take that.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou know I\u2019ve never really been great with words,\u201d Beca continues, her fingers still tap-tapping away. Chloe wants to reach over and grab them, but she can\u2019t right now. \u201cAnd umm. Last night, when we were outside and you, you know\u2026 kissed me.\u201d Beca looks like this is physically painful to put into words. \u201cI tried to tell you after, but everything came out wrong. And I\u2019ve been trying to tell you for a long time, but it took me even longer to realize what I was trying to say.\u201d</p>\n<p>Chloe doesn\u2019t really know where Beca is going with this.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd just,\u201d Beca shrugs. \u201cI thought, you know, at dinner, when I was trying to explain how I knew you were the one, or whatever,\u201d Beca rolls her eyes. \u201cI thought I was telling you. But I clearly just suck at this stuff.\u201d</p>\n<p>Chloe\u2019s eyes widen and she feels her heart flutter with hope. If Beca is saying what she thinks she\u2019s saying\u2026</p>\n<p>\u201cWait,\u201d Chloe interrupts. \u201cSo that you stuff you said at dinner. Did you mean that?\u201d</p>\n<p>Beca finally looks at her, eyes wide and vulnerable. Chloe\u2019s stomach flips. \u201cOf course I did. I love you, Chlo.\u201d</p>\n<p>Chloe stills. \u201cI know, but I mean\u2026\u201d She trails off because if she says it out loud then it\u2019s real and this hope in her chest can\u2019t die yet.</p>\n<p>Beca reaches for her hand. \u201cI know how you mean. And yeah. I love you.\u201d She shrugs again, looking anywhere but at Chloe. \u201cI\u2019m <em>in love</em> with you. I maybe always have been, but first there was Jesse and then I was just too dense to realize it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Chloe\u2019s smiling. At least she thinks she\u2019s smiling, but her lips are pulling so hard that she\u2019s afraid her cheeks are going to rip in half.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh my God,\u201d she manages to laugh out. She slumps her head back against the wall and turns to the side to look at Beca. \u201cOh my God.\u201d</p>\n<p>Beca suddenly looks worried. \u201cIs that a good oh my God or\u2026?\u201d</p>\n<p>Chloe can\u2019t stop laughing. Her stupid heart thumps wildly in her chest and her face feels hot. \u201cYeah,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m in love with you, too.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh.\u201d Beca kind of just stares at her because she\u2019s still laughing, but then her smile grows at least as big as Chloe\u2019s. \u201cCool.\u201d</p>\n<p>Chloe snorts. \u201cYeah, cool.\u201d She squeezes Beca\u2019s hand and their eyes meet and Chloe\u2019s been waiting like six years for this moment. \u201cNow stop being a loser and kiss me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Beca\u2019s eyes widen comically. \u201cYes, ma\u2019am.\u201d She leans forward, biting her lip nervously, and Chloe\u2019s <em>done</em> waiting, so she meets Beca halfway.</p>\n<p>Beca\u2019s lips are as soft as they were last night, but Chloe feels the kiss in every nerve of her body, her synapses firing on high-alert.</p>\n<p>Beca exhales against her lips, tilting her head to deepen the kiss and Chloe\u2019s chest fills with pleasure. She can\u2019t believe this is happening. She can\u2019t believe Beca loves her back.</p>\n<p>Happiness bubbles up her throat and she pulls back, leaning her forehead against Beca\u2019s.</p>\n<p>\u201cNice,\u201d Beca mutters in awe and a laugh escapes Chloe\u2019s mouth in a rush. \u201cSo\u2026 I guess this means we\u2019re still engaged, right?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLindsey is going to be so pissed at you.\u201d Chloe shakes her head and kisses Beca again sweetly.</p>\n<p>Beca just grins that half-smile Chloe loves. \u201cDude. So worth it.\u201d</p>\n<p>As Beca leans in to kiss her again and again, Chloe can\u2019t help but agree.</p>"
