  "summary": "<p>By twenty-eight, Stiles has resigned himself to a quiet life of working in his magic shop, selling Jackson Whittemore fart-inducing tea, and looking after his goddaughter. It's a good life. But the quiet goes to hell when his sister, Lydia, shows up with a crispy werewolf in her trunk and a bite mark on her shoulder, because hard on her heels comes the hottest person Stiles has ever seen, and he happens to be looking for his uncle.</p>\n<p>You know, the dead guy Stiles helped Lydia bury last night.</p>\n<p>(Or: the <i>Pracitical Magic</i> AU nobody asked for.)</p>",

  "text": "<p>Stiles is eight years old when his mother dies, nine and a half when the grief finally takes his father. He sits with Lydia in his aunts\u2019 parlor during the wake, silent until he can take it no longer.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt was the curse,\u201d he bites out. When he concentrates, he can feel its effect on him too, like a dark band around his heart.</p>\n<p>Lydia\u2019s always been the more levelheaded of the two of them. \u201cStiles\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>But Stiles doesn\u2019t want to listen to her platitudes. He knows the truth. He knows the reason his mother died, the reason his father withered away for sixteen months before the last light went out of his eyes. \u201cI hope I never fall in love,\u201d he says viciously.</p>\n<p>Lydia holds his hand and doesn\u2019t say anything.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Stiles goes to live with the aunts after that. It\u2019s\u2026 nice. They\u2019ll never be his father, but sometimes Aunt Hestia\u2019s laugh and the way she smiles\u2014it\u2019s nice, not to forget. To have a living reminder.</p>\n<p>And, of course, the aunts have magic.</p>\n<p>Stiles\u2019s dad never mastered the gift. He used to shake his head and say he didn\u2019t have the knack, didn\u2019t have the concentration for it. He was better at solving problems the natural way. He used to say that\u2019s why he became the sheriff.</p>\n<p>Stiles, though\u2014Stiles has the gift. The breeze comes when he calls it, and injured animals seek him out to heal them, and Hestia and Kath exchange looks Stiles can\u2019t interpret and include him in Lydia\u2019s lessons.</p>\n<p>Lydia\u2019s talents, they soon discover, are mostly charm and persuasion\u2014and, of course, that other ability she gets from Aunt Kath. One night she wakes up screaming and she won\u2019t calm down; she keeps saying <em>He loved her and she burned them all</em>, over and over, hiccupping and crying. Stiles and Aunt Kath stay up with her all night until she exhausts herself and falls asleep.</p>\n<p>Stiles helps Lydia with her spellwork and she helps him with his geography, and things are okay. Stiles misses his dad and his mom, but he has Lydia. He has the aunts. He has magic.</p>\n<p>He starts to heal.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Until one night Stiles wakes up from a nightmare: he is grown, and his love is dead, and Lydia is married with a life of her own, and the aunts are gone. He knows, then, what he has to do.</p>\n<p>With Lydia by his side, he sneaks into the greenhouse and takes down a bowl.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Lydia says. She\u2019s seated on the counter, swinging her feet quietly against the cupboards.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m making sure,\u201d Stiles says, and starts the gathering.</p>\n<p>He never wants to fall in love. He picks rosemary first, to remind himself why. \u201cWhen I fall in love, it\u2019ll be with someone strong. So strong they can lift a car.\u201d After a moment\u2019s consideration, he adds an acorn.</p>\n<p>Lydia makes a noise of disbelief but doesn\u2019t stop him.</p>\n<p>\u201cThey\u2019ll be so beautiful everyone will want them,\u201d Stiles goes on, coaxing an opened silk cocoon from a branch, \u201cbut so hurt underneath they\u2019ll never believe it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Now Lydia <em>definitely</em> disapproves. \u201cStiles, are you sure you want to\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThey\u2019ll have green eyes,\u201d Stiles interrupts as he adds a touch of moss. Then: \u201cNo, brown.\u201d A hazelnut. \u201cYellow.\u201d A daisy. \u201cBlue.\u201d A shell. \u201cRed.\u201d A single rose petal.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo one could <em>possibly</em> fit that description,\u201d Lydia points out.</p>\n<p>Exactly, Stiles thinks. Exactly. \u201cThey\u2019ll play an instrument. Violin.\u201d He plucks a maple key from a sapling and adds it to the bowl. \u201cAnd their favorite TV show will be <em>Captain Planet</em>.\u201d He crouches and scoops a handful of the earth from under his feet.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to be alone for a long time,\u201d Lydia says with a deep sigh.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s the idea,\u201d Stiles agrees, tossing the bowl to mix the ingredients together. \u201cCome on. I need one more ingredient.\u201d</p>\n<p>They steal outside under cover of night and rush to the edge of the cliff, where the wind buffets them from all directions. Stiles waits until the clouds part in front of the moon before holding the bowl over his head and letting the spark inside him ignite. <em>I wish</em>, he thinks as hard as he can as the pieces of his spell float into the night. <em>I wish</em>.</p>\n<p>The dark circle around his heart seems to throb in acknowledgment.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>\n<em>Eighteen years later</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cUncle Stiles we\u2019re gonna be late!\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles <em>hurphs</em> as a solid five-year-old lands on his back, and wonders how it can be morning already. Life is so unfair. He groans and rubs a hand over his eyes. \u201cOkay, okay. I\u2019m up. Is there coffee?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAunt Hestia says coffee rots your soul,\u201d Rina tells him matter-of-factly as she rolls onto the empty bed beside him. Hestia does say that, every morning.</p>\n<p>\u201cAunt Hestia is a witch and a morning person,\u201d Stiles says, throwing off the blankets and pretending not to notice the way they cover Rina completely, \u201cwhich is frankly unnatural. What did Aunt Kath say?\u201d</p>\n<p>Giggling, Rina fights the comforter back. Her curly blond hair is already frizzing out of its braids. \u201cShe said she doesn\u2019t want to talk to you until you\u2019ve had your second cup.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, <em>there</em> you are,\u201d Stiles says. \u201cAre you all dressed? Good girl. What do you think, McDonald\u2019s breakfast? Since we\u2019re going to be late and everything.\u201d Rina wakes him up late every Friday on purpose, he\u2019s sure of it. She\u2019s always up at dawn with the aunts herself. She has her mother\u2019s energy.</p>\n<p>Her sunny outlook on life too, thank the goddess. Stiles doesn\u2019t know how he\u2019d cope otherwise.</p>\n<p>\u201cCan I get two hash browns?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOnly if you eat your Egg McMuffin first.\u201d Stiles tries to be a good surrogate parent and not give her a complex about her weight, but he\u2019s pretty sure there\u2019s more nutritional value in the egg than in deep-fried maybe-potato. \u201cNow say good-bye to the aunts and get your lunch out of the fridge while I shower, okay?\u201d</p>\n<p>The next ten minutes are a blur, as they always are on Friday mornings. Stiles showers hurriedly, forgoes a shave, brushes his teeth, dresses in clothes that are probably mostly clean, and sweeps downstairs to snag a travel mug of delicious hot soul-polluting caffeine from Aunt Kath\u2019s rheumatic hands. He presses a kiss to her pale cheek. \u201cYou\u2019re the best.\u201d</p>\n<p>Aunt Hestia harrumphs, but she\u2019s smiling.</p>\n<p>Stiles grabs the rub he was up last night perfecting off the counter beside her before smacking a kiss on her cheek too. \u201cCo-best,\u201d he assures her, pocketing his keys. One last check and he\u2019s ready to go. \u201cSee you tonight.\u201d</p>\n<p>The Martin house sits far enough on the outskirts of town that most people would drive, but Stiles likes the exercise, likes the way the wind speaks to him as they walk, and he\u2019s trying to instill healthy habits, McDonald\u2019s breakfast aside.</p>\n<p>Rina\u2019s still young enough that she doesn\u2019t complain about holding his hand. Stiles still remembers Erica\u2019s breakdown when Rina started to insist she be allowed to walk everywhere rather than ride in the stroller. He didn\u2019t understand then, but now. Well. He understands a little too well.</p>\n<p>\u201cTell me the story of how Mommy and Daddy met,\u201d Rina demands, as she does every Friday morning.</p>\n<p>(He and Erica are sixteen, sitting in the school cafeteria, Erica contemplating a bright-red apple as Stiles powers through a plate of french fries one by one. Finally Erica puts the apple down and raises an eyebrow at him and leans over the table in an impressive display of cleavage. \u201cSo,\u201d she says, frank, no judgment, \u201care you ace?\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles blinks at her, uncomprehending. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAsexual,\u201d Erica repeats. \u201cAre you? Because you never seem to, you know.\u201d She makes several easily interpreted lewd gestures.</p>\n<p>For a beat Stiles debates what to tell her. Lying would be easier. But he doesn\u2019t like lying, least of all to his best friend. \u201cYou know about the curse.\u201d He\u2019s less conscious of it now than when he was a child, but he can still feel it when he concentrates, whenever he\u2019s missing his parents.</p>\n<p>Erica waves a hand. \u201cEveryone knows about the curse. Didn\u2019t stop your dad, or his dad, or whatever.\u201d</p>\n<p>And that\u2019s the thing, isn\u2019t it; it\u2019s not fair, but it\u2019s only the men in the family who carry the curse. Aunt Kath\u2019s healthy. Of course, she\u2019s a banshee; maybe the rules don\u2019t apply to banshees. \u201cYeah, well. I don\u2019t want to fall in love.\u201d Stiles shrugs. \u201cWhen I was ten I cast a spell so I never would.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Erica says gamely, \u201cbut you don\u2019t have to fall in love to have sex, you know.\u201d</p>\n<p>And that\u2019s\u2026 a fair point. Stiles doesn\u2019t have to spare himself the pleasure to spare himself the pain.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd just FYI, you have the kind of shoulders girls wanna throw their legs over.\u201d Erica punctuates this pronunciation with a red-lipsticked bite of apple.</p>\n<p>Stiles chokes on a french fry. \u201cJesus, Erica. Are you volunteering?\u201d</p>\n<p>She smirks and wipes at a drop of juice with her thumb. \u201cNah, that was last year. You missed your chance. Besides, some of us <em>want </em>a love connection.\u201d She gestures with her head toward a spot a few seats down, where a tall, broad young man is quietly eating his lunch. \u201cHe\u2019s in my chem class. Really smart, which is always hot. What do you think?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell,\u201d Stiles says after a moment\u2019s consideration, \u201c<em>I\u2019d </em>throw my legs over his shoulders,\u201d and Erica laughs.</p>\n<p>Five years later he\u2019s the man of honor at their wedding.</p>\n<p>Two years after that, he\u2019s there to see Rina into the world.)</p>\n<p>Someday, when Rina\u2019s old enough to appreciate how much of a boss her mother really was, Stiles will tell her the real story. Until then, he just smiles and says, \u201cYour mom and dad met at school, and your mom fell in love with his big brain.\u201d</p>\n<p>He drops Rina off at her kindergarten class with a kiss on the forehead, then meanders the two blocks over to his little herbalist shop and opens up.</p>\n<p>The whole town knows about the Martins. Hestia and Kath have been meddling in matchmaking since before Stiles was in diapers, and by all accounts Stiles\u2019s grandfather was the most gifted seer the continental US had seen in a century. But healing has always been Stiles\u2019s specialty. He loves his little shop with its scents of sage and lemongrass, and he likes to help.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s only been in for twenty minutes when the door above the shop jangles and a man about his age comes in, brushing rainwater from his hair. (It never rains on Stiles unless he wants it to.)</p>\n<p>Stiles smiles. \u201cScott.\u201d</p>\n<p>Scott sneezes, and Stiles remembers belatedly\u2014\u201cOh, crap, I forgot. I needed some mistletoe for Mr. Shum\u2019s thrombosis. You\u2019re allergic now. I\u2019ll put it in the back.\u201d</p>\n<p>Scott sneezes again. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles relocates the offending herb and chants a quick spell to purify the air. By the time he returns to the front, Scott\u2019s fidgeting with the homemade lip balm display.</p>\n<p>\u201cSorry, man, I completely forgot I had that in here.\u201d Stiles digs in his shoulder bag for the rub he put together last night. \u201cHow\u2019s Joey doing? I heard from Mrs. Chifor that the science test was a doozy.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe got an A minus,\u201d Scott says proudly. \u201cThanks again for the study tips.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnything for another member of the ADHD tribe.\u201d Stiles sets the canister on the counter and hops up onto his stool. \u201cKira still working that arson case?\u201d</p>\n<p>Scott grimaces. \u201cYeah. The hours suck, but she\u2019s hoping if she can break it, she\u2019ll get that promotion she\u2019s been gunning for.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHmm,\u201d Stiles agrees, collecting a few different tea samples from the back wall. Things haven\u2019t been easy for Scott and Kira lately, what with Scott losing his job due to newbie-werewolf issues. And wasn\u2019t <em>that</em> a surprise, when one of Stiles\u2019s best customers walked into his shop with such a change in his aura. Until Scott was bitten, Stiles didn\u2019t even know werewolves <em>existed</em>.</p>\n<p>He\u2019d had <em>words</em> with Aunt Hestia that day. Then he buried himself in research until he and Scott were both confident Scott could control his new powers.</p>\n<p>\u201cStiles?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSorry,\u201d Stiles says automatically, coming back to himself as he rolls everything into the paper bag. \u201cHere. Try that salve on Joey\u2019s chest and back when the asthma gets bad. It might take me a couple tries to get the mixture just right, but I should be able to help.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cStiles,\u201d Scott protests. \u201cYou didn\u2019t have to\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles has seen Joey McCall in the throes of an asthma attack, and yes, he did. \u201cCome on, you didn\u2019t think I was all massage oils and organic lubricants, did you?\u201d Even if that <em>is</em> what first brought Scott to the store. \u201cI wanted to. And there\u2019s some stimulant teas, good for the concentration, for Kira. Maybe it\u2019ll help. Goddess knows we don\u2019t need an arsonist running around. Tell her not to drink them before bed, though.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m paying you for these,\u201d Scott says firmly, but he\u2019s smiling as he takes the bag.</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2019Course you are, fine upstanding patron like you. Fifteen bucks.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cStiles\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cScott,\u201d Stiles interrupts in the same tone. Then he shrugs. \u201cThe magic doesn\u2019t work without karma.\u201d Sometimes that means not charging more than people can afford. Scott\u2019s usually pretty gracious about accepting Stiles\u2019s help, but he insists on paying when it comes to items from the shop.</p>\n<p>Stiles makes up for it by charging douche bags like Jackson Whittemore twenty bucks a box for a tea to improve their stamina, and never mentions that flatulence is the most common side-effect.</p>\n<p>\u201cThanks,\u201d Scott says eventually, smiling. \u201cI\u2019d better go, I have an interview at the vet\u2019s office.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles smiles back. \u201cSay hi to Deaton for me.\u201d</p>\n<p>The rest of the day passes agreeably enough. Stiles closes shop for half an hour when school lets out to pick up Rina, since the aunts are heading off on some romantic getaway for a few weeks. She sits at his stool and colors in her <em>Princess and the Frog</em> coloring book. She likes to recreate Tiana with frizzy blonde curls so they look more alike.</p>\n<p>At five to five, just as Stiles is getting ready to call it a day, his cell phone rings. He looks at the call ID, then at Rina, then at the door. He locks it, kisses Rina\u2019s forehead, and takes the call in the back room.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey, Lydia.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cStiles,\u201d she says. Her voice is controlled, but it sends chills all the way through him. \u201cI need your help.\u201d</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>The trouble with Lydia\u2014well, Stiles doesn\u2019t always know what the trouble with Lydia is.</p>\n<p>By all rights she should be the most together person Stiles knows. She\u2019s brilliant, driven, and has fantastic fashion sense. She has Aunt Kath\u2019s Irish eyes and hair and skin and Stiles\u2019s dad\u2019s sharp deductive abilities. She\u2019s got a PhD from MIT in predictive mathematics and a job teaching it at Stanford.</p>\n<p>Sure, sometimes the banshee blood kicks in and she screams bloody murder, and sometimes she has nightmares for a week and tells people to avoid flying or long walks in the woods, but for the most part, she has her life under very strictly regimented control. She <em>never</em> asks for help. So when she does? Stiles goes into straight-up panic mode.</p>\n<p>This time Lydia opens with, \u201cSo remember how I told you about that guy I met?\u201d</p>\n<p>And that\u2026 is usually the trouble with Lydia.</p>\n<p>In high school she had bad taste in boyfriends. Sophomore year Jackson Whittemore broke her heart and Stiles has never forgiven him (hence the performance-enhancing flatulence tea). Unfortunately for Stiles, Lydia, and Jackson\u2019s wife, Lydia <em>did</em>, resulting in an extramarital affair that ended a year ago, just before Lydia took the job at Stanford.</p>\n<p>Stiles wanted to ask her why, then, as much as he\u2019d wanted to ask in high school. But he thinks he knows the answer. Nobody understands Lydia\u2019s drive like Jackson. And nobody sees the person under Jackson\u2019s douche bag behavior like Lydia. The two of them don\u2019t make a lick of sense together, but they make even less sense apart, and they\u2019re miserable on top of it.</p>\n<p>Now, Stiles tries to remember what she\u2019d said. \u201cThe older guy, right? Paul or something?\u201d It was an old-fashioned name. He was handsome and well-spoken, Lydia said, and then she went on a tangent about what he was like in bed and Stiles tuned her out in self-preservation.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, him,\u201d Lydia says. She doesn\u2019t spit things, she\u2019s far too reserved for that, but Stiles detects the vitriol nonetheless. \u201cTurns out he\u2019s a psychopath.\u201d</p>\n<p>Well. Some things never change. \u201cOkay,\u201d Stiles says. \u201cPlease elaborate before I jump to the worst possible conclusion.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s a werewolf,\u201d Lydia says promptly. \u201cAnd probably a serial killer. And he <em>bit</em> me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh good, that\u2019s so much worse than I imagined,\u201d Stiles says weakly, peering around the door to make sure Rina\u2019s still coloring away. She is, humming happily, utterly oblivious. Sometimes Stiles envies those without the inclination toward magic. \u201cHow can I help?\u201d</p>\n<p>Goddess bless her, Lydia gets right to the point. \u201cI need you to help me bury the body.\u201d</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>At times like these, Stiles thanks the goddess for Scott McCall. \u201cI really appreciate you taking her last minute like this,\u201d Stiles says, handing him Rina\u2019s overnight bag. \u201cLydia\u2019s having, um, an emergency. My kind of emergency.\u201d</p>\n<p>Rina\u2019s not paying attention, already camped out on the couch with Joey, watching cartoons.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s the least I can do,\u201d Scott assures him with a smile. \u201cI\u2019ll drop her off Sunday night?\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles hugs him. Scott is the best. Fuck.</p>\n<p>And then Stiles walks home.</p>\n<p>He knows more about werewolves now than he did six months ago, but he still takes the time to dig in Aunt Kath\u2019s library for anything about <em>killing them</em>, which he never needed with Scott. Not that he doesn\u2019t trust Lydia, because when she says she\u2019s done something, you can bet your ass the thing is done. Just in case there\u2019s something he needs to know.</p>\n<p>Wolfsbane, he finds, and fire, and bisection (ew) are all handy ways to rid yourself of a werewolf problem. He wonders which method Lydia employed. Probably a combination of the three; she\u2019s always been thorough.</p>\n<p>When he hears her sensible Toyota pull into the driveway, he marks his page with a feather and goes to greet her at the door.</p>\n<p>Lydia doesn\u2019t so much hug him as jump him; it\u2019s a full-on arms-and-legs experience, which tells Stiles everything he needs to know about her state of mind. He hugs her back just as tightly, breathes in the scent of her: cinnamon and mint and the tang of copper, an undercurrent of ash. She has a white bandage set just over her collarbone, just darkening to pink in the middle.</p>\n<p>Then he sets her down. They both look up at the same time; the sun\u2019s almost down. There\u2019s a half-moon tonight. \u201cWe should wait until it\u2019s dark,\u201d Stiles says with a glance toward the trunk of her car. \u201cCome on. I\u2019ll pour you a drink.\u201d</p>\n<p>He has the feeling they\u2019re both going to need it.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe met at a faculty event,\u201d Lydia tells him over a glass of pinot noir. She has her legs tucked under her on the sofa. Anyone would think she were completely at ease. Only Stiles knows better. \u201cHe said he was a visiting professor of world literatures. Paul Hayward. We talked about <em>Beowulf</em>, the epic of Gilgamesh. The <em>Iliad</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>Never let it be said that Lydia Martin is easily fooled. \u201cHe kept up,\u201d Stiles presumes aloud.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe was brilliant,\u201d she says flatly. \u201cCreative. Insightful. We\u2019d get in an argument over something and I\u2019d find myself questioning every assertion I made.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles understands that when Lydia says this, she means <em>the sex was phenomenal</em>. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p>\n<p>She thins her lips. \u201cThen, a few days later, one of the chemistry associates turned up dead.\u201d</p>\n<p>Oh, so they\u2019re at the serial killer part already. Goody.</p>\n<p>Lydia swirls her wine, another nervous tell. \u201cI didn\u2019t think anything of it at first. Why would it be related? It was just an animal attack. Except then it happened again, to an arson investigator a few towns over. A few days later, in the same town, a house burned down with its owner inside. So I checked. Harris, the chemistry associate? He was originally from the same town. And then\u2026.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles sets his glass down and waits.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd then I got that itch.\u201d Lydia hates that feeling. Stiles understands that it doesn\u2019t come to her the way it comes to him, the prompting to turn right, turn left, get watermelon instead of strawberries. Instead it\u2019s an invasive nag at the back of her mind, a compulsion. \u201cSo I looked up Paul Hayward online. Guess whose picture didn\u2019t match his Facebook profile.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI knew I should\u2019ve made you keep your Facebook account,\u201d Stiles says grimly. \u201cHow\u2019d you find out he was a werewolf?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLooking into the arson. The woman who died, Kate Argent\u2014you know, the hunting family\u2014I followed her back a couple years. A while ago there was another fire in the same town, killing eleven people. It wasn\u2019t hard to put two and two together and come up with lycanthropic revenge killing.\u201d</p>\n<p>Especially after Stiles already worked out lycanthropy was an actual possibility. He looks up and out the window; it\u2019s probably dark enough to haul a body out of the trunk now. \u201cAre you sure he\u2019s properly dead?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure a live person could smell like that,\u201d Lydia says with a delicate wrinkle of her nose.</p>\n<p>Stiles sighs. \u201cAwesome. I\u2019ll get the shovels.\u201d</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>It\u2019s not like this is the first time Stiles and Lydia have helped each other hide the bodies. It\u2019s just that this is the first time that meant hiding an <em>actual body</em>.</p>\n<p>There was the time in second grade when Lydia broke Aunt Kath\u2019s crystal vase, the time Stiles accidentally cursed Jimmy in the grade above them to ribbit like a frog for a week, the time they released goats in the school as their senior prank. The time Lydia got roofied at a party and Stiles cursed the guy who\u2019d drugged her with genital herpes (not that the aunts would have minded had they found out about that one, but Lydia didn\u2019t want anyone to know how close it had been). The time seventeen-year-old Stiles flirted his way out of a speeding ticket.</p>\n<p>Covering that up took a lot less backbreaking physical labor.</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you sure we shouldn\u2019t burn the body?\u201d Stiles whines. He\u2019s getting a blister on his thumb despite the gardening gloves, and he\u2019s already thinking longingly of trading in his herbal remedies for a vat of Tiger Balm. He wants to bathe in it.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat will attract attention,\u201d Lydia points out sensibly, wiping a hand over her forehead. \u201cBesides, how do you think I killed him? Come on, put your back into it.\u201d</p>\n<p>At this point Stiles is just hoping that he\u2019ll be able to get his back <em>out</em> of it once they\u2019re done.</p>\n<p>The sky has been threatening rain again all day, but it holds off until they\u2019ve finished covering the tarpaulin-wrapped body.</p>\n<p>Stiles strips his gloves off in disgust, exhausted. \u201cI need a fucking drink.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lydia huffs and agrees. \u201cMake mine a double.\u201d</p>\n<p>As penance for destroying Stiles\u2019s body, Lydia is in charge of the drinks. Stiles flops down at the kitchen table and breathes deeply, toying with the idea of brewing an herbal tea, but he can\u2019t make himself get up. Lydia returns quickly anyway, with a bottle and two glasses and a bowl of ice.</p>\n<p>\u201cSince when do you drink whiskey? Not that I\u2019m complaining.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSince I just broke three nails burying a deadbeat werewolf who tried to turn me in my moms\u2019 backyard.\u201d Lydia scoops the glasses through the ice and pours them each a generous measure. \u201cIf this is an acquired taste, I\u2019m acquiring it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell.\u201d Stiles lifts his glass. \u201cCheers to that.\u201d</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Stiles doesn\u2019t so much wake up the next morning as suddenly cease to be unconscious and immediately regret it.</p>\n<p>What in the name of the goddess was he thinking? He hurts <em>everywhere</em>. Including his head, because wow, hello, hangover. Stiles has just the thing for that, provided he can get down the stairs without puking.</p>\n<p>At least he thought to shower last night so he doesn\u2019t have to smell himself on top of everything else. That would be too much.</p>\n<p>By the time he stumbles downstairs, Lydia\u2019s already awake and making coffee.</p>\n<p>\u201cGoddess bless you,\u201d Stiles says, flopping into a seat at the kitchen table.</p>\n<p>Lydia starts a little, then turns around. \u201cYou look chipper.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFuck you, sis. How are you not hungover?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSome of us can hold our liquor,\u201d she says loftily, but she hands over a mug, so Stiles doesn\u2019t curse her on the spot. \u201cUnlike lesser mortals.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThis lesser mortal <em>literally</em> helped you bury a body last night,\u201d Stiles points out, inhaling the aroma of delicious caffeine. Ah, Lydia\u2019s coffee: the only thing she brews better than he does. He takes a sip. It packs a stronger punch than normal, but maybe she\u2019s been dialing up the coffee at Stanford. It wouldn\u2019t surprise him. \u201cCan I take a look?\u201d he asks, gesturing to her collar bone and the bandage peeking out from the neck of her T-shirt. \u201cI thought werewolf bites either turned you or killed you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOnly if you\u2019re bitten by an alpha,\u201d Lydia says, sliding onto the bench seat beside him. \u201cAnd only if you\u2019re human.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI guess you\u2019re safe either way.\u201d Stiles shifts the shirt collar to one side and peels back the medical adhesive to check out the wound. He\u2019s really glad he\u2019s sitting down for it. \u201cUh.\u201d Stiles closes his eyes and takes a deep breath, then makes himself look again.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s still there, livid red, a clear U shape, shallower along the sides and deep at the corners. The skin feels hot to the touch, and it\u2019s a little swollen\u2014infection. Not good.</p>\n<p>Stiles takes another deep breath, then pushes at Lydia\u2019s shoulder to turn her around, because\u2014yep. A matching, shallower wound on the back of her shoulder. \u201cHoly\u2026 how big <em>was</em> this guy when he shifted? Lydia, how the hell did you get away, never mind overpower him?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI didn\u2019t confront him unprepared,\u201d she says, like such a thing is outside the realm of possibility. \u201cI had a Molotov cocktail handy. He burned to death just like his family.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles makes a face. \u201cPoetic.\u201d He\u2019s really glad he never looked at the body inside the tarp. \u201cCome on, I\u2019ll make you something for the bite.\u201d</p>\n<p>But Lydia shakes her head. \u201cFood first. After last night, it\u2019s the least I can do.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles isn\u2019t going to argue with that. He slumps at the table nursing his coffee while Lydia cooks: eggs, bacon, hash browns. Stiles\u2019s stomach grumbles. It\u2019s too soon to tell if it\u2019s in warning or hope.</p>\n<p>Then something else grumbles, and Stiles sits straight up so fast he almost spills his coffee. Someone just pulled into the driveway. Someone with a hell of an engine, from the sound of things. Lydia must not hear it over the sound of the snapping bacon, because she startles when the doorbell rings.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll get it,\u201d Stiles assures her. It\u2019s not like half the town hasn\u2019t seen him in his pj\u2019s by this point anyway. He\u2019s never cared much for appearances.</p>\n<p>Of course, he regrets every life decision that\u2019s led to him opening the door with bedhead in last night\u2019s pajamas as soon as he sees the guy on the other side.</p>\n<p>Because the man standing on Stiles\u2019s front porch is easily the most attractive person Stiles has ever laid eyes on. Cheekbones like cut glass. Stubble so even you could sand a canoe. Dark hair, straight nose, eyes like a watercolor painting. He looks kinda pissed. Stiles thinks, <em>Damn, I wish I\u2019d put on real pants</em>.</p>\n<p>Then he gets a hit of the guy\u2019s aura and makes time for even more regrets.</p>\n<p>Before he even knows it\u2019s a tell he\u2019s stepping back, already calling on his spark, letting power gather at his fingertips, though Goddess knows he can\u2019t pull enough to put down a werewolf. Not one this powerful. The taste of all that strength is fresh, simmering just beneath the surface.</p>\n<p>Stiles can see the second the guy figures out he\u2019s a witch. His nostrils twitch and his eyes flash red.</p>\n<p><br>\nBut he doesn\u2019t look angry anymore. In fact, he just seems\u2026 surprised. \u201cUh,\u201d he says as his eyes fade back to green-brown. \u201cHi.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles lets the magic dissipate. It takes the last of his headache with it, and he curses himself for not thinking of that earlier. A little adrenaline rush goes a long way. \u201cHi,\u201d he parrots. \u201cUm. So you\u2019re a werewolf.\u201d</p>\n<p>The man nods. \u201cAnd you\u2019re a mage.\u201d</p>\n<p>With a snort, Stiles corrects the word. \u201cA witch. I\u2019m far too young to be a mage.\u201d</p>\n<p>That earns him a curious look, but the guy doesn\u2019t ask for elaboration. \u201cMy name is Derek Hale. I\u2019m looking for Dr. Martin.\u201d</p>\n<p>Of course. A ridiculously hot werewolf shows up on Stiles\u2019s doorstep. Who else would he be there for? \u201cWell, you\u2019d better come in, then,\u201d he says. He\u2019s wary, but he doesn\u2019t actually sense any malicious intent. \u201cHave you eaten breakfast?\u201d</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>As it turns out, Goddess isn\u2019t so cruel as Stiles originally believed: Derek\u2019s here on a fact-finding mission, not to be next in line to warm Lydia\u2019s bed.</p>\n<p>Lydia gives them a startled look when they enter the kitchen, but she doesn\u2019t fuss at Stiles for bringing someone in when she\u2019s less than perfectly turned out, so Stiles takes it as a win. \u201cDerek Hale, meet my sister, Dr. Lydia Martin. Lydia, this is Derek Hale, werewolf.\u201d</p>\n<p>A beat passes. \u201cPleasure,\u201d Lydia says finally, polite but cool. Then: \u201cStiles, plates?\u201d</p>\n<p>Right. If she\u2019s cooking and they have guests, he\u2019d better set the table. \u201cSo, Derek, what brings you to Half Moon Bay?\u201d he asks. \u201cWell, Lydia, obviously, but\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m looking for someone,\u201d Derek says. He pulls a smartphone out of his pocket and flicks the screen a couple times. \u201cThis man.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles rattles the cutlery down onto the table and peers at it: Stanford\u2019s faculty web site, a picture of a party of some kind. There are five people in the picture with Lydia, but it\u2019s the man with his hand on her waist that catches Stiles\u2019s attention: tall, fit, handsome, obvious charisma.</p>\n<p>Scott\u2019s mentioned before that he can hear heartbeats, and Stiles does his best to keep his steady. Holy shit. This guy is looking for the werewolf Lydia killed. This could go badly. \u201cWell, <em>I</em> haven\u2019t seen him.\u201d At least that\u2019s not a lie.</p>\n<p>Derek makes a noise of frustration. \u201cI know he\u2019s dead. And I\u2019m not\u2026 upset about that. Exactly.\u201d</p>\n<p>Apparently he already suspects Lydia might be complicit in that. Interesting. Stiles wonders if he can smell guilt.</p>\n<p>Then he wonders if he can smell other things, and decides to hope he mostly smells bacon.</p>\n<p>Stiles takes the phone and brings it to Lydia, who glances at it. Even to him, her expression and posture betray very little. \u201cOh, the sociopath. We dated.\u201d</p>\n<p>Mincing words has never been her forte.</p>\n<p>Stiles hands Derek his phone back, and Derek takes it with a nod of thanks. \u201cSo you know, then. That he was\u2026 damaged.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIf by that you mean he went on a killing spree, then yes. I\u2019m aware.\u201d</p>\n<p>Hoo boy. Shots fired. Stiles clears his throat. \u201cDerek. Coffee?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2026 yes,\u201d he says, drawing his eyebrows together in obvious consternation. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles turns back to the cupboards and pulls down his favorite mug, the one that used to be his father\u2019s, with the sheriff\u2019s badge on the side. He fills it automatically, adds cream and sugar, just so it turns caramel, and then offers it to Derek.</p>\n<p>Who accepts it with a look of even greater consternation. Well, there\u2019s no pleasing some people. Still, he drinks it, so. \u201cMy uncle\u2026 he was severely burned in a fire almost twenty years ago. Werewolves heal, but sometimes not for a long time, and not from things like this. The fire\u2026 it killed our whole family except for three of us. My uncle Peter, my sister Laura, and me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Well there\u2019s a boner killer. \u201cJesus,\u201d Stiles mutters. That must be the fire Lydia mentioned last night, the one where eleven people died. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek continues without acknowledging him, cupping his hands around his mug. \u201cMy sister became the alpha after that. It felt wrong to stay when we knew we would be hunted, so we put Peter in a long-term care facility and moved to New York.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd then, a few months ago, Peter disappeared.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles finds himself listening with rapt attention. \u201cHe healed?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe didn\u2019t know,\u201d Derek says. \u201cLaura came to find out, and then she disappeared too.\u201d</p>\n<p>A chill shakes down Stiles\u2019s spine. He knows from Derek\u2019s tone of voice what he suspects that means. \u201cAnd then the killings started,\u201d he guesses.</p>\n<p>Looking haunted, Derek nods. \u201cI know he killed the hunter who set the fire. Her accomplices too.\u201d</p>\n<p>At Lydia\u2019s gesture, Stiles stands again and starts plating up the food. \u201cHow do you know he\u2019s dead?\u201d</p>\n<p>For a moment the only sounds are the hiss and spit of the eggs finishing frying in bacon fat and the scrape of the spatula in the hash browns. Then Derek says, \u201cWhen my sister died, I should\u2019ve become the alpha. The only reason I wouldn\u2019t have is if another werewolf killed her. And Peter\u2019s face in those pictures\u2014he\u2019d have needed the alpha powers to heal that completely. He didn\u2019t have any children, so when he died\u2026.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles looks over his shoulder in time to see him shrug. \u201cI\u2019m the alpha now,\u201d he finishes, his eyes flashing red.</p>\n<p>So that\u2019s what that means.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not looking for trouble,\u201d Derek continues after another sip of coffee. He looks at it again like he can\u2019t quite believe it exists, but seriously, it\u2019s just coffee. It\u2019s not even Lydia\u2019s best work. \u201cI just want to know what happened.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles finishes plating Derek\u2019s eggs and glances at Lydia. Her kill, her call.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ll help you figure it out,\u201d Lydia offers after meeting Stiles\u2019s eyes. Apparently they\u2019re not telling the whole truth, but Stiles is happy enough they\u2019re not sending him away. He seems lonely.</p>\n<p>\u201cIn the meantime, I am nursing a serious hangover and I need my grease fix,\u201d Stiles says brightly, crossing the kitchen with a plate in each hand. He slides Derek his first. \u201cBon appetit.\u201d</p>\n<p>For a second Derek stares at his plate like Stiles conjured it out of nothing. Then he gingerly picks up a fork. \u201cThanks,\u201d he says gruffly.</p>\n<p>Stiles decides not to ask and picks up a different conversation thread instead. \u201cSo you can be born like this? A werewolf, I mean.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek finishes a bite of hash browns before nodding. \u201cIt can be inherited. It isn\u2019t always. My little brother was human.\u201d</p>\n<p>Ugh, Stiles is the <em>worst</em> at casual conversation. Well, given that what little he knows of Derek surpasses Shakespearean tragedy in nature, maybe it\u2019s not completely his fault that every avenue of conversation leads to grief. He saws determinedly at his bacon. \u201cSee, because I have this friend who got bitten a couple months ago, and, well, everything he\u2019s learned about being a werewolf, he\u2019s learned from me.\u201d He shrugs and shoves the bacon in his mouth. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t know dick about being a werewolf.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek sets down his fork. \u201cWhy doesn\u2019t he ask his alpha?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDude, there is no alpha. Scott is Little Orphan Werewolf. A bite-and-run.\u201d</p>\n<p>Frowning, Derek pauses with his hand halfway to his coffee mug. \u201cAnd he hasn\u2019t hurt anyone?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat? No. Why would he hurt anyone? Scott\u2019s, like, an actual puppy. He has a wife and kid. Hell, he\u2019s babysitting <em>my </em>kid.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cStiles,\u201d Lydia says.</p>\n<p>Right. He probably shouldn\u2019t give too much away lest Derek ask why Stiles\u2019s kid needed a babysitter.</p>\n<p>Then Lydia rolls her eyes. \u201cDon\u2019t talk with your mouth full.\u201d</p>\n<p>Oh. \u201cSorry.\u201d He shoots Derek an apologetic wince. \u201cI was raised right, I promise, I just tend to let my manners lapse since the only people I eat with are my aunts, my best friend, and my former best friend\u2019s five-year-old. And I think Aunt Hestia\u2019s eyesight is going.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s a long story,\u201d Lydia says smoothly when Derek just stares.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe point of it being, we\u2019ll help you figuring what went down with your uncle, but if you could give Scott some pointers in the mean time, that would be awesome. There\u2019s even a nice inn in town, by the water. Good rates if you\u2019re staying longer than a week.\u201d</p>\n<p>Please let him want to stay longer than a week. Stiles\u2019s seduction game is hella rusty.</p>\n<p>After a beat, Derek shrugs. \u201cI don\u2019t have anywhere to be.\u201d</p>\n<p>And that\u2019s just sad. Stiles shovels in a forkful of egg before it can get any colder and then grabs Derek\u2019s empty coffee mug. Something tells him the guy drove all night.</p>\n<p>\u201cAwesome!\u201d Stiles enthuses, reaching for the sugar. \u201cWe can head over after breakfast.\u201d</p>\n<p>He gets no argument from Derek.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Scott, though. Scott is a different story.</p>\n<p>He opens the door with Rina on his shoulders, a broad smile on his face, and Joey behind him holding a soccer ball. \u201cStiles! Hey. We were just about to hit the park.\u201d Then he glances at Derek as if he\u2019s about to ask <em>who\u2019s your friend</em>, but the words don\u2019t get out because his eyes flash yellow and his fangs come out and it\u2019s altogether a good thing neither Rina nor Joey can see his face.</p>\n<p>\u201cScott! Buddy. This is Derek. He was in the neighborhood and I thought you might have some questions for him.\u201d Stiles keeps his gaze fixed on Scott\u2019s even though he\u2019s dying to make eye contact with Rina. He cannot have two werewolves duking it out on Scott\u2019s front lawn when his kid could get caught in the crossfire.</p>\n<p>Fortunately, Scott gets control of himself quickly and reaches up to hand Rina over. Stiles takes her gratefully with a smacking kiss on the cheek, and doesn\u2019t put her down even though she\u2019s really too big to be held.</p>\n<p>Scott and Derek stare intensely at each other for a minute. \u201cHow do you know he\u2019s not the one who did this to me?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2019Cause he\u2019s been an alpha for all of five minutes.\u201d It\u2019s pretty obvious. The guy is still walking funny, like he doesn\u2019t know what to do with the twenty pounds of muscle he probably put on in the past few days. \u201cCome on, I\u2019ll play soccer with the kids and you and Derek can chat. Can\u2019t hurt, right?\u201d</p>\n<p>When no answer is forthcoming, he asks Rina. \u201cYou\u2019ll play soccer with me, won\u2019t you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMe\u2019n Joey are gonna kick your butt, Uncle Stiles,\u201d she informs him with a bright smile.</p>\n<p>\u201cJoey and I,\u201d Stiles corrects, winking at Derek over her shoulder.</p>\n<p>Derek stares at him. Stiles is starting to believe it\u2019s just a thing he does, like he\u2019s forgotten how to be around people.</p>\n<p>\u201cJoey and I are gonna kick your butt,\u201d Rina repeats dutifully.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ll see about that.\u201d Stiles sets her down and takes her hand. \u201cYou guys coming or what?\u201d</p>\n<p>In the end, Joey and Rina keep Stiles running for almost an hour while Scott and Derek chat quietly on a bench nearby. The ground is still wet from the rain yesterday, and all three of them fall more than once and get up again with mud and grass smeared all over. They look more like guerilla fighters than soccer players by the time Joey\u2019s breathing gets labored and he has to stop.</p>\n<p>Both Derek and Scott get up from the bench, but Stiles gets there first, sliding to his knees in the muck and coaxing him to get out his inhaler. \u201cJust like the doctor taught you, Joey, come on,\u201d he says encouragingly, calling a spark to his fingertips and splaying his right hand on Joey\u2019s collarbone.</p>\n<p>This is the problem with magic, Stiles thinks as Scott and Derek come to a halt on either side of him. Rina steps up next to Joey and takes his free hand as he breathes from his inhaler. Stiles can help, he can make balms and teas and ointments and poultices and potions. He can channel relaxation through his fingertips as he\u2019s doing now, smoothing out the muscles of Joey\u2019s airways.</p>\n<p>But it\u2019s all temporary. He can\u2019t cure a chronic condition. He learned that the hard way with Erica\u2019s epilepsy. Make it more manageable, yes. Speed up her recovery, yes. But a cure? No. He could cure himself, maybe, or teach another spark carrier to cure herself. But he\u2019s helpless when it comes to humans. There\u2019s a limit to what he can do.</p>\n<p>After a few tense moments, Joey relaxes and takes his inhaler away from his mouth.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou okay, buddy?\u201d Scott asks. He has a way of saying it that Stiles envies, somehow conveying that it\u2019s okay <em>not</em> to be okay without implying that he isn\u2019t.</p>\n<p>\u201cMaybe that\u2019s enough excitement for one day,\u201d Stiles says wryly, getting to his feet. He stumbles a little in the slick mud and Derek steadies his elbow before he even realizes he\u2019s falling. \u201cYou want me to take Rina home?\u201d</p>\n<p>Scott looks at Joey. \u201cUp to you, little man.\u201d</p>\n<p>In turn, Joey looks at Rina. \u201cIs it okay if we just do a puzzle?\u201d</p>\n<p>Rina says, \u201cI like puzzles.\u201d</p>\n<p>Bless the three of them.</p>\n<p>\u201cBut can we have lunch first?\u201d she adds.</p>\n<p>Scott grins and sweeps her up onto his shoulders again. \u201cYeah, we can eat first. French toast? Pancakes? Mac and cheese?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBeans and wieners?\u201d Rina says hopefully.</p>\n<p>\u201cBeans and wieners it is. That okay with you, Joey?\u201d</p>\n<p>Joey picks up the ball. \u201cSure.\u201d</p>\n<p>And just like that, everything\u2019s settled again. \u201cThanks,\u201d Stiles tells Scott back at his house, as the kids get inside to wash up. Derek waits by his car\u2014he insisted on driving, and it\u2019s every bit as ridiculous as Stiles imagined. He hopes Derek\u2019s not compensating for something. \u201cI owe you for this.\u201d He doesn\u2019t just mean babysitting money.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou can watch Joey for a weekend when Kira finally breaks this case,\u201d Scott says with a knowing smirk.</p>\n<p>Oh God. Scott thinks\u2014\u201cI didn\u2019t ask you to watch her so I could have an <em>illicit sex weekend</em>,\u201d Stiles hisses, mortified. There\u2019s a muffled noise from the driveway and he remembers belatedly that <em>Derek can hear him</em>. Fuck. \u201cI didn\u2019t even know he was coming until he got here this morning. Lydia\u2019s helping him look into some stuff with his uncle. Guy was bugfuck.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHey, when opportunity knocks and it looks like that,\u201d Scott says. His eyebrows fill in the rest. \u201cJust make sure he knows the score, okay?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThanks for that.\u201d Stiles sighs. He always makes sure his partners know he can\u2019t and won\u2019t get attached. It was fun for a while in high school, the novelty of it, but now he just wishes he could have something normal. \u201cI\u2019ll pick Rina up tomorrow morning. Sound good?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo hurry,\u201d Scott tells him.</p>\n<p>\u201cCall me if Joey has another attack.\u201d</p>\n<p>And then he\u2019s back down the front steps, standing around awkwardly as he and Derek decide whether they\u2019re going to pretend Derek didn\u2019t just overhear Scott suggesting they hook up for the weekend. Awkward. Stiles knew he was rusty, but this is ridiculous.</p>\n<p>Finally Derek says, \u201cMind showing me where that inn is?\u201d and Stiles doesn\u2019t know if that\u2019s a line or not, but it breaks the tension.</p>\n<p>\u201cSure.\u201d He sidles around to the passenger side and slips in. \u201cWe need to head back the way we came.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek puts the car in gear, and a few moments pass in silence before Stiles gathers the nerve to say, \u201cSorry about Scott\u2019s awkward assumptions.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine. Do you often spend the weekend with total strangers?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNot as often as I\u2019d like,\u201d Stiles admits, injecting just enough sarcasm into his voice to be cute rather than creepy.</p>\n<p>Derek snorts.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s kind of a long story,\u201d Stiles says when Derek doesn\u2019t say anything else. \u201cI don\u2019t really date, so.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI get it,\u201d is the gruff answer. \u201cMe neither.\u201d</p>\n<p>Now that\u2019s interesting. Stiles can\u2019t help looking at him at that, studying the set of his jaw, the way his fingers caress the steering wheel. Something tells him it\u2019s a deliberate display of nonchalance\u2014that he\u2019s white-knuckling it underneath. And Stiles is never wrong about these things. \u201cSupernatural reasons or crippling emotional trauma?\u201d</p>\n<p>That earns him something closer to a laugh. \u201cThe latter. You?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFamily curse,\u201d Stiles says ruefully, rubbing at his chest, over his heart. \u201cSo, a little of both. Turn here, the inn\u2019s down by the water.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek pulls the car into the lot a minute later. \u201cYou want to wait here, or\u2026?\u201d</p>\n<p>If Stiles goes in\u2026. He probably shouldn\u2019t go in. \u201cI\u2019ll stay.\u201d Marin, the proprietor, has never liked Stiles much, probably since Stiles\u2019s dad figured out her girlfriend was living under an assumed identity and was wanted for murder in three states.</p>\n<p>Half Moon Bay isn\u2019t much of a sleepy little town sometimes, between the creatures of the night and Stiles\u2019s witchiness.</p>\n<p>Before long, Derek emerges from the front office, expression cloudy. That doesn\u2019t look good. \u201cThey\u2019re booked up.\u201d</p>\n<p>Of course they are. Oh well. Maybe it\u2019s a sign. \u201cNever mind. We have like eight bedrooms anyway; you can stay with us.\u201d If he\u2019s going to be helping Scott and they\u2019re going to be helping him, that only makes sense. As long as he doesn\u2019t ask about the seven-foot-long recently dug-up plot of earth in the backyard, they\u2019re totally safe.</p>\n<p>Derek shifts guiltily. \u201cAre you sure? I could find another place\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNot in Half Moon Bay,\u201d Stiles tells him with a shake of his head. Seriously, it\u2019s a town of twelve thousand people; it\u2019s a miracle they have <em>one</em> inn. \u201cCome on, I\u2019ll direct you back home and we\u2019ll get you settled in.\u201d He glances meaningfully into the backseat, where they threw a lot of detritus before Stiles was able to sit down. There\u2019s a couple shirts and a pair of jeans back there too, some boots. \u201cThe guest room has an en suite bath.\u201d</p>\n<p>At that, Derek gives him a small smile. It\u2019s a nice, comfortable smile. Stiles could do with seeing more of it. \u201cSold.\u201d</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Stiles has become accustomed to his magic and his libido not getting along. His whole life, he\u2019s gotten mysterious urges and prompts to do this thing or that, with the result that the shoes he wanted were half off when he went to the mall, or the ladies at the church the next town over were having their bimonthly pieroghi sale when he went over to pick up herb supplies, or he just so happened to tune in to the radio in time to win a pair of concert tickets.</p>\n<p>Never once in his life has his magic helped him get laid. In fact, it\u2019s usually strangely silent for a day or two after his latest encounter. Stiles figures it\u2019s his magic reacting with Stiles sleeping with someone other than the impossible person he\u2019s cursed himself to fall in love with, and he\u2019s fine with it. Goddess gave him two hands and a vivid imagination.</p>\n<p>But when he\u2019s finished showing Derek around the house, including a detour to the laundry room because apparently the entire trunk of Derek\u2019s car was filled with worn clothing, Stiles gets that nudge.</p>\n<p>And, well. It\u2019s not the <em>worst</em> idea he\u2019s ever had. Lydia\u2019s out\u2014probably shopping, so she won\u2019t be back for hours. He and Derek have the whole house to themselves. If ever there were a time to take advantage\u2026.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s just the three of you?\u201d Derek asks when they\u2019re back in the kitchen. It\u2019s long past lunchtime, and big breakfasts always make Stiles get hungry sooner. \u201cIn this house?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, four,\u201d Stiles corrects, grabbing more or less the entire deli drawer and depositing it on the counter for sandwich-making. \u201cLydia has an apartment in the city, but the aunts live here; they\u2019re on a romantic retreat. I didn\u2019t ask.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek finishes washing his hands and sticks a couple slices of bread in the toaster. \u201cWhy this house, then? It\u2019s kind of\u2026.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cA lot for four people?\u201d Stiles says. \u201cYeah. Well, it\u2019s a family heirloom, I guess. And it has the greenhouse, which I need for work. Lydia grew up here; it\u2019s been my home ever since my dad died. It\u2019ll be Rina\u2019s someday, probably. Lydia doesn\u2019t want kids.\u201d</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a pause as they wait for the bread to toast. Finally Derek says, \u201cWhat happened to her parents? Rina\u2019s, I mean.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles runs a hand through his hair. \u201cLife. Boyd\u2014his first name was Vernon, but we all called him by his last name\u2014he was in a car accident. Somebody else\u2019s DWI.\u201d That was hard enough. For days Stiles was so sure Erica was going to ask him to bring Boyd back, and he\u2019d have to say no, and their friendship would be ruined. But she never asked.</p>\n<p>Stiles wouldn\u2019t have done it for Boyd. But he thought about it when Erica passed, and the guilt compounded with the grief almost ate him alive. \u201cErica was an epileptic. I could help her manage the symptoms well enough, but I couldn\u2019t cure her. She went out of town for work and developed status epilepticus. She seized for twenty minutes. The neurological damage\u2026.\u201d</p>\n<p>The toast pops. Neither of them makes a move to touch it for a minute, and then Stiles shakes himself and reaches for the plates.</p>\n<p>\u201cSorry,\u201d Derek says belatedly. \u201cYou\u2019re good with Rina, though.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles smiles and reaches for the Dijon mustard. \u201cAunt Hestia says it\u2019s because I never grew up.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek shoots him a shy smile. \u201cI don\u2019t know. You look pretty grown-up to me.\u201d He gives Stiles an almost subtle once-over, but he\u2019s not as smooth as he thinks; the tips of his ears go bright red.</p>\n<p>Stiles licks suddenly dry lips. \u201cWhat would you say to postponing lunch for an hour?\u201d</p>\n<p>They don\u2019t even make it up the stairs before they\u2019re kissing, tugging at each other\u2019s shirts, biting at each other\u2019s mouths. Derek pins Stiles up against the wall on the first landing, his hands hot on Stiles\u2019s back, and Stiles lets him, tilts his head back, fists his fingers in Derek\u2019s hair. Between them, magic sparks, crawling up Stiles\u2019s spine, crackling on his fingertips, pooling in his groin.</p>\n<p>When Derek bites at his neck with human teeth, Stiles shoves him away. \u201cBedroom,\u201d he says definitively. \u201cNow.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek doesn\u2019t need to be told twice. He practically drags Stiles up the last few steps, then shoves Stiles ahead of him into Stiles\u2019s bedroom. It wasn\u2019t on the tour, so he must be going on smell, which should be weird but isn\u2019t. Stiles allows himself to be shoved, waits for Derek to close the door behind him. Then he pounces, gets his arms around Derek\u2019s shoulders and his legs around Derek\u2019s waist. On a human it might be risky, but Stiles has seen Scott lift the front end of a Toyota parked on his street to get at the tennis ball that rolled underneath it. Derek can take it.</p>\n<p>And he does\u2014Derek catches him with one hand on his back and the other on his ass, and his mouth is back on Stiles\u2019s before Stiles has time to catch his breath.</p>\n<p>Stiles has enough time to think, <em>Holy shit, werewolves</em>, before he\u2019s tearing Derek\u2019s shirt over his head as Derek deposits him on the bed on his back. He hardly gets a second to admire the view before Derek returns the favor. Stiles hears the distinctive sound of seams ripping as his T-shirt goes the way of the dodo. Then suddenly he has Derek\u2019s hips between his legs, Derek\u2019s mouth on his neck, Derek\u2019s thumbs skating down from his nipples to rest in the grooves of his hips.</p>\n<p>Stiles approves. Stiles\u2019s magic approves. Stiles\u2019s dick definitely approves, if he can judge by the way it\u2019s trying to escape his muddy jeans. \u201cStop with the hickeys and get your clothes off already,\u201d Stiles gasps, shoving Derek away from him with his knees. He needs Derek to be Naked. Capital N.</p>\n<p>Derek bites at Stiles\u2019s collarbone and unbuttons Stiles\u2019s pants one-handed. As far as compromises go, it\u2019s pretty weak, but Stiles will take it because it means\u2014</p>\n<p>Derek wraps his hand around Stiles\u2019s dick. Bucking into the touch, Stiles scrabbles at the sheets, at Derek\u2019s shoulders, at the front of Derek\u2019s jeans. <em>Everything</em> is in the way.</p>\n<p>Finally the tension between them gets to be too much and Stiles pushes up with the power of his magic backing him up. Derek lands flat on his back beside him on the bed, and Stiles shoves his own pants and boxers off while Derek\u2019s still working out what the hell just happened. Before he can regain his bearings, Stiles straddles his waist. It\u2019s the only way to avoid being distracted by the urge to count his abdominal muscles. \u201cSeriously. Can I take your pants off?\u201d He punctuates the question with a thrust of his ass against Derek\u2019s cock. \u201cBecause we can do this with them on, but it\u2019s nowhere near as satisfying. Just my personal opinion.\u201d</p>\n<p>For a second Derek just stares at him. Maybe he\u2019s been struck blind and dumb by the sight of Stiles\u2019s pasty body and surprisingly hairy belly. Then he shakes it off and flips them again, and then they\u2019re both naked, and the sticky velvet rush of their dicks not-quite-sliding together makes Stiles\u2019s eyes roll back in his head.</p>\n<p>Stiles chokes on a moan and reaches down to get a hand on Derek\u2019s cock, because if he can\u2019t see it he\u2019s damn well gonna touch it. It\u2019s uncut, moisture pooling at the tip, and substantially more than a handful. Stiles wants it in him five minutes ago.</p>\n<p>As Derek licks across his collarbone, thrusting his thigh between Stiles\u2019s legs so he has something to rut against, Stiles gathers enough brain cells to ask, \u201cHow do you feel about fucking me?\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek\u2019s suddenly got <em>very sharp teeth </em>extremely close to Stiles\u2019s jugular. Apparently Stiles\u2019s danger reactions are all screwed to hell, because that just makes his dick pulse out a little puddle of precome against Derek\u2019s leg.</p>\n<p>\u201cGonna take that as a \u2018yes please,\u2019\u201d he says over the frantic beating of his own heart. \u201cLube and condoms in the drawer.\u201d</p>\n<p>When Derek sits up to grab them, Stiles finally gets to take advantage of the view. And what a view.</p>\n<p>As Erica would have said, Derek has shoulders for throwing his legs over. It\u2019s a wonder Stiles couldn\u2019t actually hear his shirt crying from the strain his biceps were putting on it earlier. His forearms are thick and corded. Stiles has never seen a chest like that, or <em>that many abs</em>, wow. He\u2019s not as hairy as Stiles would have expected for a werewolf. Is that a racist expectation?</p>\n<p>Stiles doesn\u2019t have time to decide because he\u2019s too busy looking at the dick in his hand. It\u2019s exactly as big as it feels. Fuck, he\u2019s gonna be sore tomorrow. He can\u2019t wait.</p>\n<p>He smears his thumb through the fluid at the tip as Derek slams the drawer closed and drops a condom next to his head.</p>\n<p>Derek swears. \u201cHow do you\u2014?\u201d</p>\n<p>Honestly, Stiles is tempted to ask Derek to pick him up and fuck him against the wall, but he feels like that\u2019s the kind of thing he should stretch his hamstrings for first. Instead he disentangles his legs from Derek\u2019s and gets on his hands and knees. \u201cThis work for you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI think I\u2019ll manage,\u201d Derek says, but the hoarseness of his voice undermines his sass. He slides a palm down Stiles\u2019s right cheek before brushing his thumb over his hole. \u201cYou use the rest of the stuff in there often?\u201d</p>\n<p>Whoops. Stiles doesn\u2019t usually take his one-night stands home with him. Oh well. From the erection poking him in the thigh, Derek\u2019s not offended by his sex toy collection. \u201cOften enough,\u201d Stiles says, meaning <em>whenever I have a free half hour and don\u2019t need to spend it sleeping</em>. He\u2019s about to open his mouth again to find out why Derek asked, but then Derek presses two slick fingers against his hole and slides them right in and he answers his own question.</p>\n<p>\u201cHnng,\u201d Stiles says, dropping down to his elbows. <em>Goddess</em>, it\u2019s been a while. Before he can offer a word of advice on locating his prostate, Derek beats him to it. Stiles feels the pleasure in his <em>knees</em>, for fuck\u2019s sake. \u201cYou don\u2019t fuck around.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t I?\u201d Derek says, sliding in another finger. Stiles clenches and releases and wonders who put stars in his bedroom.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh my God, put the condom on and fuck me, please. I am not above begging if that\u2019s what you\u2019re into.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek removes his fingers from Stiles\u2019s ass and there\u2019s the unmistakable crinkle of condom foil. \u201cMaybe next time,\u201d he says, sounding a little strangled, and then\u2014</p>\n<p>\u201cFuuuuuuck,\u201d Stiles groans as his spine liquefies and his face tries to melt into his pillow. He doesn\u2019t even have time to correct Derek that this is a one-time thing, because he\u2019s too busy curling his hands in the sheets to try to ground himself. His whole body wants to float away.</p>\n<p>Derek puts his hands on Stiles\u2019s hips\u2014just to hold him still as he pulls out again, apparently, and that shouldn\u2019t be so good, but Stiles couldn\u2019t move if his life depended on it and holy fuck it\u2019s hot like burning. If he could just\u2014\u201cA little shallower,\u201d Stiles commands breathlessly, and Derek pauses midthrust and tilts Stiles\u2019s hips just so.</p>\n<p>Oh <em>fuck</em>, yep, that\u2019s\u2014even Stiles\u2019s elbows aren\u2019t gonna be able to hold him up in a minute. Magic writhes across his skin like St. Elmo\u2019s fire, burning over his nipples, curling around his balls. Derek doesn\u2019t give him time to adjust, not that Stiles needs it. He just keeps up the steady thrusts, tipping Stiles\u2019s hips up into each one so he\u2019s basically hammering Stiles\u2019s prostate.</p>\n<p>Stiles figured out he didn\u2019t actually need to touch his dick to come during anal his first year of college, when he stopped settling for bad sex. Now? Now he\u2019s just hoping he doesn\u2019t come within the next twelve seconds and embarrass himself completely. Actually, scratch that\u2014he\u2019ll be lucky if his brain doesn\u2019t melt and leak out his ears, what with the magic overload.</p>\n<p>Fuck. Stiles\u2019s elbows finally give up and he slides down flat against the mattress. Derek doesn\u2019t even pause. He shuffles farther onto the bed and lifts Stiles\u2019s hips back to the correct angle and <em>keeps going</em>, relentless.</p>\n<p>Stiles makes a mental note to send Kira a congratulatory card if this is what werewolves are like in the sack. He doesn\u2019t even have a blasphemy strong enough for this situation.</p>\n<p>He should probably warn Derek that he\u2019s gonna come and then pass out.</p>\n<p>Sparks crackle at his fingertips and his dick leaks steadily against the sheet as Derek fucks him. \u201cDerek,\u201d he manages in a whisper. \u201cDerek I\u2019m gonna fuckin\u2019 come and I might black out a little after so <em>don\u2019t freak</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>What</em>?\u201d Derek says. The shock must rob him of some of his control, because he thrusts extra hard, and that\u2019s all Stiles needs. Magic arcs from his navel to the hollow of his throat and he arches his neck as he comes, every muscle and nerve in his body alive with pleasure.</p>\n<p>To his surprise, Stiles doesn\u2019t lose consciousness, just control of his motor functions. He\u2019s still shuddering with aftershocks when Derek makes a punched-out noise behind him and digs his fingernails into the flesh of Stiles\u2019s hips and Stiles is going to have bruises later but\u2014</p>\n<p>Derek trembles to a stop with his forehead pressed between Stiles\u2019s shoulder blades.</p>\n<p>\u201cAm I dead?\u201d Stiles croaks when his brain finishes rebooting.</p>\n<p>\u201cHeart\u2019s still beating,\u201d Derek mumbles into his skin. \u201cReally fuckin\u2019 fast.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThanks for the affirmation,\u201d Stiles pants. \u201cNow get off me, please. You\u2019re really warm and I\u2019m basically a nuclear reactor of magic right now. I don\u2019t wanna fry you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek huffs but pulls out of him, and Stiles rolls to the side, throws open the window, and fires a lightning bolt into Rina\u2019s sandbox.</p>\n<p>Silence behind him. Then Derek says, \u201cTell me that doesn\u2019t happen every time you have sex.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles stares. The sandbox is steaming. When it clears, he can see the fulgurite that\u2019s formed across the surface. \u201cNope,\u201d he admits. \u201cThat\u2019s new.\u201d</p>\n<p>A beat. \u201cOkay,\u201d Derek says. \u201cYou still hungry?\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles\u2019s stomach rumbles. \u201cGoddess yes.\u201d</p>\n<p>They eat standing up in the kitchen, holding their sandwiches over the counter, because they\u2019re both too hungry to sit down. Stiles considers it the mark of a job well done.</p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t last any longer than that before he needs a shower, though, and then he throws in a load of laundry for obvious reasons. Then, at something of a loss for things to do, he puts on a pair of ratty jeans and an old T-shirt to do some gardening.</p>\n<p>First, though, he digs the fulgurite out of the sandbox, because he is not explaining that one. It takes longer than he anticipated; the thing is three feet long and almost a foot in diameter in places. He probably needs to buy more sand.</p>\n<p>\u201cGonna keep it as a souvenir?\u201d Derek asks from behind him.</p>\n<p>Startled, Stiles almost drops it. He looks over his shoulder, smiling wryly. \u201cIt\u2019s a pretty good sex trophy, I have to admit. Maybe I should have it bronzed.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019d definitely make an interesting conversation piece.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles can only imagine. \u201cDid you need something?\u201d he asks. \u201cI\u2019m kind of a crappy host, so don\u2019t be afraid to spell things out.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Derek says, obviously distracted. \u201cNo, I just\u2026.\u201d He trails off, staring at a spot behind Stiles\u2019s right shoulder, and <em>oh fuck</em>. He\u2019s definitely looking at the recently turned-over ground where Stiles and Lydia buried his creepy uncle.</p>\n<p>Stiles turns to follow his gaze, swallowing hard against panic, because he\u2019s used to the one-night stand thing, sure, but he doesn\u2019t usually <em>lie</em> to his one-night stands about being complicit in their family members\u2019 disappearances. This is definitely the first time he himself has actually physically buried one of his partners\u2019 familial relations. He feels like scum. Derek has every right to call him on it and be really pissed off and never speak to him again, which Stiles should be fine with since it was only a casual thing anyway\u2014</p>\n<p>Except instead of an obvious seven-foot plot of freshly turned-over dirt, the grave is a flowerbed of furiously blooming aconitum lycoctonum.</p>\n<p>Lydia must have planted it, Stiles realizes. Probably not a bad idea\u2014a grave-size grass-free area is always suspicious, and it has plenty of magical uses.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, that\u2019s wolfsbane,\u201d Stiles says with a grimace. \u201cSorry, I forgot about it.\u201d Not really a lie since he didn\u2019t know it was there in the first place. \u201cI can pull it up if it\u2019ll be a problem?\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek shakes his head. \u201cJust don\u2019t put any in my food.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy would I do that? I like you. Besides, you agreed to answer Scott\u2019s newbie werewolf questions. I owe you one.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek stares at him.</p>\n<p>Stiles tries not to squirm. \u201cAnyway, you came out here for a reason, right?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTelevision,\u201d Derek blurts.</p>\n<p>Okay, Stiles doesn\u2019t know what that\u2019s about. He blinks. \u201cWe have one?\u201d he offers. \u201cBut it\u2019s definitely inside. What about it?\u201d</p>\n<p>Blushing, Derek scuffs his (bare) toe in the dirt. \u201cI can\u2019t get it to\u2026.\u201d</p>\n<p><em>Ah</em>. \u201cNew to Netflix, huh?\u201d Stiles says. He stands and brushes off his knees. Gardening can wait anyway. He hefts the fulgurite over his shoulder and gestures toward the house. \u201cI\u2019m gonna rock your world. Again! Seriously, Netflix is the best. Just don\u2019t expect to do anything productive for the rest of the day.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDarn, and I had so many plans,\u201d Derek deadpans.</p>\n<p>Stiles smirks at him and curses his policy on only sleeping with people once.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>In retrospect, Stiles could\u2019ve been a little clearer about boundaries, because judging by Derek\u2019s behavior, he didn\u2019t really get the memo.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s not that he\u2019s clingy.</p>\n<p>Okay, it is. He\u2019s clingy. He clings like a fucking octopus, and he\u2019s affectionate to boot, and he seems determined to be touching Stiles if at all possible. Stiles is going to tell him the score any minute now, except\u2026.</p>\n<p>Goddess. Except it\u2019s really nice, okay? It\u2019s nice to have Derek wrap his arms around him from behind while he\u2019s chopping veggies for dinner. It\u2019s nice to get a foot massage while introducing Derek to the glory that is <em>Firefly</em>. And Derek probably can\u2019t even help the urge to rub his face against Stiles\u2019s neck and shoulder every hour or two. After all, they\u2019re sharing space and they\u2019ve slept together recently; it\u2019s probably just a wolfy instinct thing.</p>\n<p>And he seems so <em>happy</em>. It\u2019s a complete one-eighty from this morning, when Derek brooded at his eggs and told what was basically the world\u2019s saddest fucking life story. Taking that away from him now would be cruel.</p>\n<p>Besides, there\u2019s no <em>real</em> reason Stiles can\u2019t sleep with him again, right? He\u2019s already cursed himself not to fall in love, so he\u2019s safe on that front. By his own admission, Derek doesn\u2019t do relationships either. If they fall into an arrangement where they happen to have really hot sex, who is it harming, really? No one, that\u2019s who.</p>\n<p>When Lydia comes home, she takes in the two of them on the couch, the impressive array of hickeys on Stiles\u2019s neck, the way the whole house is still charged with leftover sexual energy, and raises a Very Judgmental Eyebrow.</p>\n<p>\u201cLike you have room to talk,\u201d Stiles says before she can say anything. The words come out kind of slurred; it\u2019s possible he\u2019s a little stoned from foot massage endorphins. He didn\u2019t know that was a thing. \u201cAt least Derek\u2019s not a psychopath.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNice, Stiles.\u201d She rolls her eyes. \u201cDerek, you want to talk about your uncle?\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek stops rubbing Stiles\u2019s feet\u2014dammit\u2014and sits up straight. Oh well. It was nice while it lasted. He flicks <em>Firefly </em>off and puts on something else so Derek can finish watching later.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s mostly asleep by the time Derek returns from the kitchen and runs a hand through his hair. \u201cMmm,\u201d Stiles says.</p>\n<p>Derek snorts. \u201cYou should go to bed.\u201d</p>\n<p>As comfortable as Stiles is right now, Derek is probably right. By morning, he will regret sleeping on the couch. But he\u2019s sleepy and cozy and Derek is playing with his hair, so his incentive to move is pretty low. \u201cYeah,\u201d he agrees without moving. \u201cJust keep doing that.\u201d</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Stiles wakes up the next morning in his own bed with no memory of how he got there. Come to think of it, he doesn\u2019t remember putting the sheets back on it either. When he turns his head to the side, there\u2019s a definite impression on the pillow beside his.</p>\n<p>So he and Derek should definitely have a chat. But later.</p>\n<p>Stiles rolls out of bed and into the shower, takes the time to shave off his scruff, and stumbles downstairs to the sounds of cartoons. It must be later than he thought, because Rina\u2019s already dressed and camped out in front of the TV with a big bowl of bananas, oranges, and honeydew melon. She\u2019s got yogurt at the corners of her mouth and a smile on her face. \u201cHi, Uncle Stiles.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHi, baby.\u201d Stiles drops beside her on the couch and presses a kiss to her hair. \u201cUncle Scott drop you off?\u201d</p>\n<p>She nods. \u201cHe said Mr. Derek must have made you tired. Is that why you slept in?\u201d</p>\n<p>Dammit, Scott. Stiles should not have to field this kind of question from a five-year-old before he\u2019s had his morning coffee. \u201cSomething like that,\u201d he says wryly, thinking that he\u2019s definitely going to have to talk to Derek about what\u2019s okay in front of Rina. So far she hasn\u2019t asked him any awkward questions like why doesn\u2019t he have someone like her mom had her dad or Aunt Hestia and Aunt Kath have each other, and he\u2019s not honestly sure what he\u2019d say. <em>Once upon a time, Uncle Stiles\u2019s great-great-grand-douchedaddy hit his wife one too many times and she left him, so he cursed all his sons never to fall in love, and if they did, their lovers would die to punish them for their disobedience</em>. Seriously, what an asshole. He was such a misogynist he forgot to curse his daughters too, though ultimately that worked in the women\u2019s favor. \u201cWhat are you watching?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMr. Derek put it on. Did you know he liked cartoons?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cEveryone likes cartoons,\u201d Derek puts in as he comes in from the kitchen with, bless him, two steaming mugs. He passes one to Stiles, who mouths his thanks. \u201cThis one used to be my favorite.\u201d</p>\n<p>Curious, Stiles turns back to the TV. A pale-blue man with green hair is in the process of saving the day.</p>\n<p>A werewolf <em>would</em> love <em>Captain Planet</em>. \u201cNature boy, huh?\u201d he says with a smirk.</p>\n<p>Derek smiles back. \u201cYou\u2019re the one with the green thumb.\u201d</p>\n<p>Snatching a cube of honeydew from Rina\u2019s bowl, Stiles asks, \u201cSo where\u2019s Lydia?\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek shrugs. \u201cWasn\u2019t here when I woke up. She said something last night about someone named Jackson?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh good grief,\u201d Stiles groans. One of these days Lydia\u2019s going to get run out of town for being a home-wrecker. <em>Why Goddess</em> won\u2019t Jackson just divorce his fucking wife so everyone can be happy?</p>\n<p>Wait a second\u2014\u201cDid you, uh.\u201d He looks down at the bowl of fruit. \u201cYou got Rina breakfast?\u201d</p>\n<p>For a moment, Derek looks shy, hesitant. \u201cI\u2014Scott said he hadn\u2019t had time to feed her. His mom got Joey some kind of last-minute Sunday appointment with a respiratory specialist and he had to leave in a hurry. Is that okay?\u201d</p>\n<p>Fuck. \u201cFine,\u201d he says, hoping his voice doesn\u2019t sound as choked as it feels. He cannot get used to this. <em>Derek</em> cannot get used to this. \u201cThanks,\u201d he adds after a second. \u201cYou could\u2019ve woken me up.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUncle Stiles, I can\u2019t hear the TV,\u201d Rina says pointedly.</p>\n<p>If Stiles takes that as an excuse to put off the Very Serious Conversation until later, no one has to know.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Except he never manages it. Lydia reappears Sunday afternoon, and it doesn\u2019t seem right to try to sneak a conversation like that in with another adult in the house. By the time Lydia packs her stuff up for the drive back to Stanford, Derek\u2019s back at Scott\u2019s for more werewolf talk.</p>\n<p>When Derek returns with bloody, torn clothing, Stiles almost has a heart attack. \u201cDerek, what\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTraining,\u201d Derek says, cracking his neck. He takes off his shoes and strips off his shirt right there by the front door. Underneath, his perfect chest is unmarked. \u201cTrying to get Scott to fight without shifting all the way.\u201d He shrugs. \u201cHe got the job at the veterinarian\u2019s and wanted to work off some excitement.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles smiles in relief. \u201cGood for him. Though maybe you could look into making sure he interacts with animals okay next. Deaton probably won\u2019t flip out on him\u2014he\u2019s a druid\u2014but it\u2019d make Scott\u2019s life easier.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek pauses in the middle of unbuckling his belt. \u201cIs everyone in this town some kind of supernatural creature?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSeems that way sometimes,\u201d Stiles says ruefully. The town can pretty much be divided into categories of \u201cin the know,\u201d \u201cliving in denial,\u201d and \u201cprobably shows up in a myth somewhere.\u201d \u201cI can\u2019t believe I didn\u2019t know about werewolves. We\u2019ve got banshees\u2014Aunt Kath, and Lydia\u2019s half, of course. Deaton and his sister, the one who runs the inn, are druids. We had a darach about twenty years ago but Aunt Hestia bound her powers and my dad found some outstanding warrants for her arrest, so she\u2019s in jail in Oregon now. Oh! And Scott\u2019s wife\u2019s a kitsune.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek finishes stripping his jeans and Stiles follows him to the laundry room, where he deposits his clothes. Stiles doesn\u2019t know who he\u2019s kidding; that stuff isn\u2019t fit to burn. \u201cJoey?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThey don\u2019t know yet.\u201d Stiles shrugs. \u201cHe won\u2019t present until puberty. If he doesn\u2019t, they\u2019ll probably think about finding an alpha werewolf to ask for the bite. Scott used to have asthma too, before he got bitten. But if he is a kitsune, we don\u2019t know how he\u2019ll react.\u201d</p>\n<p>He does his best to keep his eyes on Derek\u2019s face, but it\u2019s <em>hard</em>. Literally and figuratively. Still, this is important. He can\u2019t let himself get distracted. \u201cListen, I just\u2026 thank you for getting Rina breakfast this morning. But um. We probably shouldn\u2019t\u2026 while she\u2019s around\u2026.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cStiles.\u201d Derek looks pained and a little hurt, and Stiles\u2019s stomach sinks at the sight. Derek\u2019s aura pretty much reads like \u201ckicked puppy\u201d 87 percent of the time, and he doesn\u2019t want to contribute to that. \u201cI\u2019m not going to do anything inappropriate with your daughter around.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s not what I meant!\u201d he says, even though it kind of was. \u201cJust\u2026 Rina knows about magic but not werewolves or kitsune or the rest. I\u2019m\u2014I don\u2019t want to give her too many questions, you know? Or nightmares. Not that I think you\u2019d scare her or anything, but the idea of strange werewolves might.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh.\u201d Some of the hurt washes away, and Stiles doesn\u2019t know whether to be relieved or panic because he just took back some of what he meant to say. This conversation is not going at all according to plan. \u201cIt\u2019s okay. I get it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Fuck. Stiles swallows a lump in his throat, knowing he needs to go at least one step further. \u201cThanks. And um. While you\u2019re here, while <em>she\u2019s</em> here, I think you should. You should sleep in the guest room. Not because I\u2019m ashamed of you or anything, but she\u2026 she\u2019ll assume you\u2019re staying.\u201d Permanently. Because the only people Rina knows who shares beds are her dead parents and Aunt Hestia and Aunt Kath.</p>\n<p>\u201cI understand,\u201d Derek tells him. But the read Stiles gets on his aura\u2014it\u2019s like something is <em>choking</em> him. At his sides, his hands clench into fists and release.</p>\n<p>Swallowing, Stiles reaches up above the laundry tub and pulls down a basket of bath oils. They got moved here while the guest bathroom was being renovated and then nobody thought to put them back where they belong. Bergamot\u2014no. Sandalwood\u2014no. There. Lavender.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019d rather have you in my bed with me,\u201d Stiles says boldly, and then immediately flushes. He can\u2019t say what prompted him to make that admission, which means it was probably his magic at work. Since the damage is done, he might as well go on. \u201cI\u2019ve never shared a bed with someone. I liked it. But I can\u2019t.\u201d He holds up the vial of oil. \u201cLet me make it up to you.\u201d</p>\n<p>It\u2019s pretty obvious Derek has no idea what Stiles has in mind, but apparently that doesn\u2019t bother him. He acquiesces with a slight nod, and Stiles leads him upstairs to the bedroom of the guest bath. Hestia and Kath renovated it just a few years ago with a truly ridiculous Jacuzzi tub. Stiles fills it with hot water and a generous helping of the oil and says, \u201cGet in.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek skins out of his boxers and obeys.</p>\n<p>\u201cLavender is for protection,\u201d Stiles says. There\u2019s a basket of unused bath goodies at the side of the tub, and he selects a purple loofah and soaks it in the water before taking Derek\u2019s hand in his and scrubbing the dried blood from the back. \u201cSleep. Peace.\u201d Things he suspects Derek needs and hasn\u2019t had in a long time.</p>\n<p>Derek doesn\u2019t say anything. He watches, seemingly rapt, as Stiles works the loofah up his arm, washing away all traces of blood.</p>\n<p>\u201cWishes,\u201d Stiles continues, washing Derek\u2019s shoulder now. \u201cLong life.\u201d His nape. \u201cPurification.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek almost flinches at that one, and Stiles wonders what he did that he thinks he can\u2019t be forgiven for.</p>\n<p>Derek relaxes when Stiles stops talking and concentrates on cleaning him, literally and metaphysically. Cleansing an aura isn\u2019t always easy, isn\u2019t even always possible. Derek carries a lot of guilt, a lot of repressed violence, and even more sadness. Stiles can\u2019t wash that away without washing away a part of Derek, and he won\u2019t do that. But he can soothe it, and with the lavender easing the process, he can root the hope that Derek might one day forgive himself.</p>\n<p>By the time Stiles finishes washing Derek\u2019s feet, the water is only lukewarm and Derek\u2019s head is lolling against the edge of the tub. Stiles grabs the fluffiest towel from the linen closet and coaxes Derek to stand, then rubs him dry as the tub drains.</p>\n<p>Two minutes later, he pulls the covers over Derek\u2019s body. He\u2019s so cooperative and pliant Stiles should be shocked, but he isn\u2019t. Magic has that effect sometimes, particularly on supernatural beings.</p>\n<p>Stiles has the strangest urge to leave Derek\u2019s bedroom door open when he leaves, but he forces himself to close it. He falls asleep in his own bed, alone, and dreams of a creature with six glowing red eyes.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Somehow, playing house with Rina and a lone werewolf isn\u2019t weird.</p>\n<p>During the week, they get up more or less at the same time. Derek makes breakfast while Stiles gets Rina ready for school, and then it\u2019s business as usual. While Stiles is at work, Derek hangs out at the house or, when Scott\u2019s off work, with him, presumably teaching him things about werewolfing you can only learn from experience. Then he picks Rina up from school and drops her at the shop. Sometimes the three of them hang out together, and sometimes Derek disappears again to do who knows what. For all Stiles knows, he\u2019s looking for an apartment.</p>\n<p>Once Stiles is done work, the three of them eat dinner together, then take a walk or play a game or watch TV. (Derek is the least repentant Sorry! player Stiles has ever met, which is saying something, because he grew up playing against Lydia.)</p>\n<p>As long as Rina\u2019s awake, Derek keeps his distance, limiting his contact with Stiles to casual brushes of their hands and sometimes shoulders. But as soon as she\u2019s upstairs in bed, he\u2019s Mr. Touchy Feely, stealing kisses while Stiles makes coffee, rubbing his face over Stiles\u2019s hair and pulling his body closer when they\u2019re sacked out on the couch. They don\u2019t sleep in the same bed, but they still <em>go</em> to bed together. Tuesday night Derek rims Stiles until he cries. Thursday Stiles sucks Derek\u2019s cock until his brain is starving for oxygen; then he lets Derek come on his face and jerk Stiles off with his jizz. Stiles sleeps like a baby every night and forgets about Sunday\u2019s weird dream.</p>\n<p>He tells himself it doesn\u2019t matter that he\u2019s breaking all his rules for Derek. He\u2019s cursed himself not to fall in love anyway. He might as well enjoy some adult company while he can. Besides, Derek seems lonely.</p>\n<p>Lydia calls him after her class on Friday, and susses out everything that\u2019s happened in a week from Stiles\u2019s tone when he answers the phone.</p>\n<p>\u201cGood for you, sweetie.\u201d</p>\n<p>It\u2019s hard having secrets when your sister\u2019s a half-witch half-banshee genius. Stiles groans.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m serious. It\u2019s about time you stopped trying to convince yourself you\u2019re not the romantic type.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo one is romancing anyone else,\u201d Stiles says firmly. \u201cThis is a casual arrangement where two lonely people get off together.\u201d He sighs as the guilt comes creeping back in. It\u2019s been more persistent over the past few days, especially at night. \u201cBesides, once he finds out I helped bury his last surviving family member and didn\u2019t say anything about it, he\u2019s not going to want anything to do with me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cJust don\u2019t let him leave before next weekend. I can\u2019t make it back before then, and I dug up some more info on what Peter was up to.\u201d</p>\n<p>Somewhere in the back of Stiles\u2019s brain, a warning bell goes off. He suspects it\u2019s because the idea of keeping Derek around for another week strongly appeals to him. \u201cOkay. I don\u2019t really think he\u2019s in a hurry to go anywhere anyway.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGood. I have to go, there\u2019s a hot new cocktail bar opening tonight and I need a manicure.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles snorts. \u201cBye, Lydia.\u201d</p>\n<p>The store gets quiet now that Scott\u2019s working again, but Stiles doesn\u2019t mind. He putters around, making note of what needs replenishing, what\u2019s selling well, what isn\u2019t. He orders supplies. He mixes up some herbal remedies.</p>\n<p>At four, the door opens to admit Derek and Rina. After a brief pause, Derek says, \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles comes back to himself to find that he\u2019s staring down at a smoldering pile of rowan branches. Or rather, they were rowan branches when he picked them up on his way to work in the morning. Now they\u2019re ashes. Stiles blinks at them. \u201cMaking the ingredients for a protection spell, apparently.\u201d He takes a ziplock bag from under the counter and uses a spark of magic to sweep the mess carefully into it.</p>\n<p>Derek frowns. \u201cShould I be worried?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNah,\u201d Stiles says, but only because Rina\u2019s here. He is definitely concerned. \u201cJust a precaution.\u201d</p>\n<p>He thinks Derek catches what he doesn\u2019t say, though, because when he goes to bed that night, he leaves the door open, like he might need to run out at any moment.</p>\n<p>This time the dream is less forgettable. Stiles is a woman, small but powerful. His borrowed veins thrum with anticipation. Someone is watching him. Someone is stalking him.</p>\n<p>Not far away, a train whistles. In the opposite direction, a stream burbles through the forest.</p>\n<p>Then the trees rustle and he catches a familiar scent. But by the time he turns\u2014</p>\n<p>\u201cHello, Laura.\u201d One half of the man\u2019s face is handsome. The other half is scarred and blistered. His eyes burn electric blue in the low light. Stiles inhales a sharp breath, but before he can assume a defensive stance, the man produces a Taser.</p>\n<p>Electricity flows through his body, and he can\u2019t move. He can only look up into a face that seems familiar as claws slash across his throat and blue eyes bleed to red.</p>\n<p>Stiles has only been in the kitchen for two minutes when Derek joins him, clad only in a pair of Stiles\u2019s borrowed pajama bottoms. \u201cCouldn\u2019t sleep?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNightmare,\u201d Stiles says succinctly. Then amends, \u201cWell. Maybe vision.\u201d He flips around his laptop so Derek can see; he has Google Maps pulled up, displaying California. \u201cWhere did you say you used to live?\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek pulls out the chair beside him and sits down. \u201cBeacon Hills.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles nods and types that in, then zooms until he finds the railroad tracks. Another minute of searching scores him the location of the river. He bites at his bottom lip for a minute, debating what to tell Derek.</p>\n<p>\u201cStiles?\u201d</p>\n<p>He sighs. \u201cI think this is where Peter killed your sister, if\u2026 if you wanted to look for her body.\u201d</p>\n<p>For a moment Derek doesn\u2019t speak or react. Then he licks his lips and tears his gaze away from the screen to meet Stiles\u2019s eyes. \u201cProphetic dream? Do you get those often?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI get them never,\u201d Stiles corrects. That\u2019s the reason he\u2019s awake right now. \u201cThey\u2019re usually Lydia\u2019s division. Related to the banshee thing, I guess. Though they\u2019re not necessarily prophetic. Just true.\u201d</p>\n<p>Another pause. \u201cSo you\u2019re freaking out.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLittle bit,\u201d Stiles says off a slightly hysterical laugh. He switches tabs to open a new Google search. <em>Beacon Hills +</em>.</p>\n<p>Plus what? Running a hand through his hair, Stiles turns back to Derek. \u201cLook, you don\u2019t\u2026 have to answer. I get that you probably really don\u2019t want to talk about it. But your family. When exactly\u2026?\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek tells him the date, and Stiles types it in along with the rest of what he knows. Maybe if he can duplicate Lydia\u2019s research, he can figure out why he had the dream.</p>\n<p><em>Eleven dead in tragic house fire</em>.</p>\n<p>Stiles clicks.</p>\n<p>Beside him, Derek doesn\u2019t say anything. He doesn\u2019t look at the article. He probably knows every word by heart. But this is easier, Stiles thinks, than Derek telling him himself. Than Derek reliving\u2014</p>\n<p><em>An investigator for the Beacon Hills Fire Department ruled the fire accidental</em>.</p>\n<p>Now there\u2019s a load of horseshit if Stiles ever read one. He does another search, this one for more recent house fire fatalities in the area, and comes up with a picture of a pretty blonde woman named Kate Argent.</p>\n<p><em>\u201cHe loved her,\u201d </em>ten-year-old Lydia sobs in his memory. <em>\u201cHe loved her and she burned them all.\u201d</em></p>\n<p>\u201cOh fuck,\u201d Stiles says, slamming his laptop closed. Panic tightens in his chest.</p>\n<p>Derek catches his wrist before he can start pulling out his hair. \u201cStiles. What\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles shudders out a breath. \u201cHow much do you know about banshees?\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek frowns. \u201cNot much. They can see death and danger, and it makes them scream, right? As a warning?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMore or less.\u201d It\u2019s more complicated than that, but even Stiles doesn\u2019t understand all the nuances. \u201cUsually banshee children don\u2019t experience the deaths until they hit puberty. Kind of a defense mechanism. Then, when they\u2019re old enough, the banshee powers kick in and the screaming starts. But if something especially violent or traumatic happens nearby, especially something linked to the supernatural world, they can wake up early.\u201d Stiles runs a hand over his face.</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you saying\u2026?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe fire. The one that killed your family and maimed your uncle?\u201d He forces himself to meet Derek\u2019s gaze. \u201cLydia was ten. That\u2019s what woke her powers. There\u2019s no fucking way that\u2019s a coincidence, Derek. I don\u2019t know what your uncle wanted with her, but it wasn\u2019t good.\u201d</p>\n<p>Silence falls in the kitchen again as Stiles edges closer to panic. He should have made Lydia tell him everything. It\u2019s not in his nature to let others do the heavy lifting. He doesn\u2019t know what came over him.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles looks down in surprise; Derek\u2019s hand is covering his on the table. \u201cCall her in the morning,\u201d Derek suggests.</p>\n<p>He nods. \u201cYeah.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek herds him gently back to bed. Stiles doesn\u2019t fuss when he crawls in after him and tugs Stiles into his body. \u201cI\u2019ll hear Rina when she wakes up,\u201d he promises. \u201cJust try to sleep.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles thinks he\u2019ll be up all night worrying himself into old age, but something about Derek must soothe him\u2014his warmth, maybe, or the rhythmic rise and fall of his chest. Stiles closes his eyes to the tattoo of Derek\u2019s breath on the back of his neck and doesn\u2019t wake up until morning.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>After coffee, and after Stiles has convinced Rina to take a bath, because he\u2019s seen Derek wrinkling his nose and even Stiles\u2019s pitiful human senses are offended, he meets Derek in the kitchen.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey,\u201d Derek says, handing Stiles a refilled mug. Derek learns fast.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey,\u201d Stiles answers, taking the mug and a fortifying breath. \u201cSo listen. I called Scott\u2019s mom, and she\u2019s willing to look after Rina so we can catch up on your unfinished business. If your sister was anything like you, I should be able to find the place she died. And we can pick up the rest of your stuff, if you have any?\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek clenches his jaw and nods slowly. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wincing, Stiles offers, \u201cWe don\u2019t have to if you\u2019re not ready. I mean. I lost both my parents before I was ten. It\u2019s not the same scale as what happened to you, but I get it, if you\u2019re not ready to bury her. I\u2019m not judging you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek shakes his head. \u201cNo, you\u2019re right. I need to do this.\u201d He sets his half-empty mug in the sink. \u201cI\u2019ll go get ready to leave.\u201d</p>\n<p>They drive the first half hour out of Half Moon Bay in silence. Stiles wonders if it\u2019s because they have nothing to talk about, or too much.</p>\n<p>Finally he can\u2019t take it anymore. \u201cThat night Lydia woke up,\u201d he says, careful to pick a time when there are no other cars on the highway. \u201cShe kept on saying \u2018he loved her and she burned them anyway.\u2019\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek\u2019s fingers go white-knuckled on the steering wheel, and Stiles watches him swallow.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to tell me. I just\u2026.\u201d He feels like he needs to know, somehow. Because he\u2019s sleeping with Derek now? Because they\u2019re sort of friends? Because Derek\u2019s essentially living with him and his kid and he doesn\u2019t have the aunts there for backup?</p>\n<p>\u201cWhen I was fifteen, I met this girl,\u201d Derek says. \u201cPaige. She\u2014thought I was a huge asshole, actually.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles chokes, not expecting any kind of levity. \u201cYou don\u2019t say.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek looks sideways at him and shoots him the tiniest of smiles. It\u2019s bittersweet, but Stiles will take it. \u201cShut up. She was right, but she liked me anyway, I guess. So we started dating.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles is sensitive enough to Derek\u2019s aura by now that he knows this is where things go to shit. \u201cThen what happened?\u201d he asks gently.</p>\n<p>With a shake of his head, Derek admits, \u201cI don\u2019t know. There were a bunch of other packs in town for a meet of some kind. Peter tried to convince me the only way Paige and I could be together is if she got the bite. But I wasn\u2019t ready to tell my mom yet, and Paige didn\u2019t even know about werewolves. You can\u2019t just bite someone without their consent, that\u2019s not\u2014that\u2019s not how my mother did things. But somehow Paige got bitten.\u201d</p>\n<p>Ah. Since Scott was turned, Stiles has read everything he can on werewolf lore. He can guess where this is going. \u201cHer body rejected the bite.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShe suffered,\u201d Derek says quietly. \u201cIt hurt her and she was just\u2014dying, slowly. So I\u2026.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles nods. His throat is thick and he doesn\u2019t have the words to make this better, so he just puts his hand over Derek\u2019s on the gearshift and waits him out.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd then, a year later, I met Kate.\u201d</p>\n<p>Fuck. Stiles thinks back to the obituary he read. How old had it said she was? Fortysomething. And if the fire was eighteen years ago and Derek was sixteen\u2014</p>\n<p>His stomach sours. \u201cI can guess the rest,\u201d Stiles tells him.</p>\n<p>Derek doesn\u2019t offer any more details. Stiles doesn\u2019t really want to know anyway. But he feels like he has to offer something in exchange, something genuine. He can\u2019t let Derek be the only one to show his throat.</p>\n<p>He says, \u201cMy great-great-whatever grandfather cursed his whole family. Well, no. Just the men. He was a bitter old bastard who hit his wife too many times, and when she left him, he cursed the rest of us. That if we ever fell in love\u201d\u2014fuck, his voice is breaking, <em>why is his voice breaking</em>\u2014\u201cthat person would die young. So we would know his pain.\u201d He spits the last part, as he always does.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s what you meant by family curse,\u201d Derek says after a long pause. His voice is quiet, maybe too understanding. And sad, Stiles thinks. Derek is sad.</p>\n<p>He nods, staring out the window. \u201cThe curse killed my mom when I was eight. Then grief killed my dad when I was nine, and I sort of\u2014always said that wouldn\u2019t happen to me. When I was ten I did something about it. I cast this stupid spell\u2014that I would only fall in love with someone who was this thing, and that thing. Basically that I would never fall in love at all.\u201d They pass a mile marker. \u201cSometimes I regret it, though.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou have a good life.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles smiles, bittersweet. \u201cYeah.\u201d It could be better, but yeah. He\u2019s happy. He has what he needs. Then: \u201cYou\u2019re going to want to take the next exit.\u201d</p>\n<p>They park in one of the lots for the Beacon Hills Nature Preserve, and Stiles takes out his phone to check the GPS. It\u2019ll be a bit of a hike, but hell, he\u2019s been in the car for three hours. He could use the exercise. After a minute spent with his eyes closed, listening to the call of his magic, he finds the thread he\u2019s looking for. \u201cCome on. This way.\u201d</p>\n<p>They walk for an hour in almost total silence before Derek stiffens beside him. Stiles lets him lead from there.</p>\n<p>Twenty minutes later they\u2019re standing over Laura\u2019s body.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s\u2014awful. Peter didn\u2019t bury her, so her corpse has been scavenged by animals, devoured by insects, and ravaged by the weather. Even Stiles, who has practiced witchcraft his entire life and has thus <em>seen some shit</em>, wants to gag at the sight. But Derek kneels next to her and touches what remains of her hair, then the silver triskele shining around what was once her throat. Carefully, the maneuvers the chain so he can unclasp it, then tucks the necklace into his pocket.</p>\n<p>Stiles touches his shoulder in silent support and wishes for the hundredth time that he could tell Derek what happened to Peter. Instead, he says, \u201cWhat do you want to do?\u201d</p>\n<p>They brought a shovel from the car, just in case. Stiles could also call in an anonymous tip to the local PD. Or he could use the spark at his fingertips to cremate her bones. But none of those seem right.</p>\n<p>\u201cShe should have a headstone,\u201d Derek mumbles. \u201cI\u2019ll order one for the family plot. But maybe something here too.\u201d</p>\n<p>That, at least, Stiles can help with. He closes his eyes and stretches out with his magic, letting the energy of the forest seep into his bones until he can feel every leaf, every animal and insect, every rock and tree root.</p>\n<p><em>There</em>. At a gentle nudge from Stiles, the tree roots shift, and the ground around them trembles until a black granite boulder breaches the surface.</p>\n<p>Derek stares at him.</p>\n<p>\u201cI can\u2019t do anything fancy for an inscription,\u201d Stiles says apologetically. Not without a serious power boost and a lot of concentration. \u201cI could manage initials. Unless you want to\u2026?\u201d He holds up his hands and curls his fingers like claws.</p>\n<p>Derek looks down at her body. \u201cYou should do it,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019ll be nicer if you do it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Nodding, Stiles returns his attention to the stone and channels his power through his index finger. The rock chisels away at his touch, disintegrating into a little stream of black sand. It takes more out of him than he thought it would, and he stumbles when he steps back.</p>\n<p>Derek catches him just below the shoulder before he can fall, and they take a few steps away from the skeleton and its marker.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat do you want to do?\u201d Stiles asks quietly, once the lightheadedness has passed.</p>\n<p>Derek picks up the shovel Stiles had propped against a tree trunk and gets to work.</p>\n<p>Two hours later finds them in a fifties-style diner on the outskirts of Beacon Hills. Stiles orders his burger with curly fries and a milkshake. Derek gets his with extra bacon and a side of sweet potato fries. It\u2019s probably a good thing he has a werewolf metabolism.</p>\n<p>\u201cI have a few things to take care of while we\u2019re here,\u201d Derek says, watching with flushed cheeks and a pained expression as Stiles sucks down half of his milkshake. \u201cDo you mind?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat was kind of the whole point,\u201d Stiles tells him. Then: \u201cOw, brainfreeze.\u201d</p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t argue when Derek pays for their meal.</p>\n<p>It turns out Derek had rented an apartment in Beacon Hills while he investigated what happened to Laura. It\u2019s a huge, unfriendly industrial loft, and while it has a certain bad-boy coolness factor, Stiles has a hard time reconciling the Derek he knows\u2014the Derek he\u2019s seen fully submerged in a Jacuzzi tub smelling of lavender, the Derek who picks Stiles\u2019s kid up from school, the Derek who practically melts into Stiles\u2019s overstuffed couch at the end of the day\u2014with someone who would want to live here.</p>\n<p>It does match his car and the leather jacket, though.</p>\n<p>\u201cDude, who are you,\u201d Stiles says rhetorically as Derek slides the door closed behind them.</p>\n<p>Derek shoots him a sly smile, but it\u2019s undercut by the exhaustion and sadness that have plagued them both all day. \u201cI have layers.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cA mystery wrapped in an enigma wrapped in a leather jacket,\u201d Stiles agrees in an attempt at levity. The loft doesn\u2019t have much in the way of furniture, just an ugly couch and a coffee table, a drafting table and some chairs, and a bed with slightly ridiculous purple sheets Stiles isn\u2019t going to comment on right now. What it does have is books\u2014on the tables, in a bookshelf along one wall, on the unmade bed, on the windowsill. \u201cCan I use your bathroom?\u201d</p>\n<p>By the time he returns to the main room, Derek has set a cardboard box on his bed and filled it to the brim with books. He doesn\u2019t seem to have any concern for anything else.</p>\n<p>\u201cI take it you\u2019re not sticking around here,\u201d Stiles says casually.</p>\n<p>Derek shakes his head and looks up. \u201cI grew up here, but there\u2019s nothing for me here anymore.\u201d</p>\n<p>Everyone he knew in this town is dead. Stiles swallows and asks the question that\u2019s been haunting him all day. \u201cWhere will you go?\u201d</p>\n<p>Looking back at the box again, Derek shrugs. \u201cI figured I\u2019d stick around Half Moon Bay for a while until Scott\u2019s feeling more confident. It\u2019s a nice place. And then\u2026 maybe I\u2019ll go back to New York.\u201d</p>\n<p><em>You should stay</em>, Stiles wants to tell him. But he can\u2019t. Not when he already suspects Derek might have feelings Stiles can\u2019t return. He isn\u2019t that cruel.</p>\n<p>Instead he nods. \u201cYou going to give your landlord back the keys?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Derek says, nodding absently. Then his nostrils twitch and he amends, \u201cBut I\u2019m going to shower first.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles has to sit next to Derek in the car on the way home, so he doesn\u2019t disagree. \u201cSure. I\u2019ll just entertain myself.\u201d</p>\n<p>What he means by that is <em>I\u2019m gonna go through the stuff you deem worthy of keeping</em>. As soon as the bathroom door closes behind Derek, Stiles kicks off his shoes and paws through the books. It\u2019s an eclectic mix\u2014history textbooks in with Vonnegut, photo albums sandwiched between cookbooks and Victorian poetry. Stiles is going to make fun of Derek for that later, he decides.</p>\n<p>But until then, he\u2019s in Derek\u2019s bed, and it\u2019s\u2026 comfy. It smells like Derek. It only takes Stiles a few wriggles before he\u2019s cozy enough to fall asleep.</p>\n<p>And wakes again suddenly when the mattress moves. When he opens his eyes, Derek\u2019s face is inches above his, eyes shining red in the late afternoon light. He\u2019s already naked\u2014maybe <em>still </em>naked, and damp from his shower\u2014and as soon as he sees Stiles is awake, he shoves his face under Stiles\u2019s chin and inhales.</p>\n<p>Being sniffed is a turn-on now, apparently. Stiles tilts his head back and lets his legs part a little farther. \u201cWow, I had this whole elaborate seduction planned,\u201d he lies, \u201cbut\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek licks him from his collarbone to that hot place behind his ear, and Stiles abandons that train of thought for something more direct. \u201cFuck, tell me you\u2019ve got lube.\u201d</p>\n<p>It seems like it might be a vain hope\u2014Derek doesn\u2019t even have a bedside table\u2014but he drops his weight down on one elbow and fishes beside the bed and oh <em>thank goddess.</em> Stiles considers wishing for a condom too, but fuck it, Derek\u2019s a werewolf and can\u2019t give him anything anyway, and when is Stiles going to get another chance to bareback risk-free? <em>Never,</em> that\u2019s when. He\u2019s all aboard this bad idea train.</p>\n<p>Actually, <em>all aboard</em> sounds like a great idea. Stiles hooks his ankle behind Derek\u2019s bare leg and rolls them over, sending the box of books crashing to the floor.</p>\n<p>\u201cOops.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek laughs as Stiles scrambles off of him, stripping clumsily all the while, but he\u2019s hard already, even though Stiles hasn\u2019t touched him, so Stiles decides not to take it as an insult. \u201cSo graceful.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPlease,\u201d Stiles says with a grin, ridding himself of his left and final sock. \u201cYou want to get up on this.\u201d Then he straddles Derek\u2019s waist again and brackets Derek\u2019s head with his arms. \u201cToo bad. Tonight this is getting all up on you instead.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek\u2019s eyes go dark. Half a second later, he circles Stiles\u2019s hole with two slick fingers. \u201cYou gonna ride me?\u201d</p>\n<p>Fucking <em>Goddess yes</em>. \u201cHnng,\u201d Stiles agrees as Derek slides them inside. He works his hips, already desperate for more. Power and lust surge through him, making his nerve endings sing. \u201cUnless you have any objections?\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek whisks his hand away only to return it with more lube and\u2014fuck\u2014more fingers, first three and then four, and Stiles opens for them so easy he suspects his magic of interfering.</p>\n<p>Fuck it, this is the greatest abuse of power <em>ever</em>. No wonder so many witches go dark side. Stiles shudders as Derek massages his prostate, lets his eyes fall half-closed, sucks in a breath.</p>\n<p>And then suddenly he needs Derek\u2019s cock in him <em>now</em>, can\u2019t wait another second. Blindly, he reaches for the lube. He almost drops it twice because Derek\u2019s screwing his fingers into him mercilessly, but he finally gets it open and gets his slick hand on Derek\u2019s dick, and then it\u2019s only a matter of seconds before he drags Derek\u2019s fingers away from his ass and sinks down on his erection instead.</p>\n<p>\u201cFuck,\u201d Derek says, settling his hands on Stiles\u2019s hips and thrusting up.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Yes</em>,\u201d Stiles agrees, rolling with Derek\u2019s motion. He loves being on top, loves the thrill of seeing his partner lose control beneath him. It\u2019s also easier to control the intimacy and keep things casual. Plus\u2014</p>\n<p>\u201cThere, <em>there</em>, fuck, that\u2019s good.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u2014it\u2019s good for mathematical reasons. Stiles curls his body backwards, braces himself on his arms, closes his eyes, and chases his own pleasure. He\u2019s not looking for more than the exquisite wet slide of Derek inside him and the jolt of pleasure from his prostate, so when Derek thumbs the head of his erection, Stiles chokes on a groan, his hips jerking automatically. He looks up to find Derek watching him, eyes dark. Stiles always forgets that as much as he likes this position because it lets him soak in his partner's pleasure without unwanted intimacy, the reverse is also true.</p>\n<p>Derek strokes him once, firmly, root to tip, and licks his lips like he's tasting the air. The sight is visceral somehow, and magic crackles sympathetically low in Stiles\u2019s stomach. He shoves his body down on Derek's cock and arches so hard he's almost parallel with Derek's legs as he comes, gasping, his whole being singing with it.</p>\n<p>Before he can recover, Derek flips them, smearing Stiles's come between their bellies, continuing to nudge his erection up against Stiles's prostate. The overstimulation should be uncomfortable, but it isn't; Stiles whimpers and spreads his knees and wordlessly invites Derek to destroy him.</p>\n<p>Derek kisses him instead.</p>\n<p>And this is why Stiles avoids being fucked on his back. It's unavoidably intimate, <em>close</em>, and he never wanted to know how much he liked it. Because he does like it, loves it even, the scrape of Derek's stubble on his chin, on his neck, the sweaty press of his body, the taste of his mouth.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Stiles doesn't so much get hard again as never soften in the first place.</p>\n<p>\"Stiles,\" Derek rasps, a rumble Stiles feels through his whole body. His thrusts are getting ragged, and Stiles knows he must be desperate.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He runs his nails down Derek's back and meets his movements as best he can. \"Do it,\" he whispers hoarsely. \"Come on.\"</p>\n<p>Derek\u2019s breath catches on a shocked, wet-sounding gasp, and he freezes and then trembles, licking at Stiles\u2019s mouth.</p>\n<p>And then\u2014</p>\n<p>\u201cOh God,\u201d Derek whispers, and follows it with an impossible noise as he presses his forehead to Stiles\u2019s shoulder.</p>\n<p>Stiles says, \u201cWhat\u2026?\u201d because he\u2019s new to barebacking, okay, but guys have come inside him before using condoms and it\u2019s never felt remotely like <em>that</em>. Like Derek\u2019s dick is actually getting bigger, stretching Stiles from the inside, and it\u2019s\u2014</p>\n<p>It\u2019s really fucking <em>good</em>.</p>\n<p>\u201cFuck,\u201d Derek says quietly. He\u2019s still shaking in minute little shivers. \u201cSorry. I didn\u2019t mean to.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Stiles says again, squirming a little and letting his eyes fall closed. He feels pleasantly warm and tingly almost everywhere. When he shifts, though, the tingles ignite into a smolder. Whatever is going on with Derek\u2019s dick, Stiles\u2019s prostate likes it. A lot. \u201cFuck, okay, you should\u2014you should explain this to me. In small words.\u201d Which are all he\u2019s capable of understanding right now.</p>\n<p>Derek pauses and lifts his face so he can look Stiles in the eyes. \u201cYou\u2019re not hurt?\u201d</p>\n<p>Incredulous, Stiles raises his eyebrows and glances down his body, where his erection is pressed flat against his stomach, drooling precome. \u201cSeriously?\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek follows his gaze and makes a punched-out noise. \u201cIt\u2019s a werewolf thing. Sometimes, when we\u2026 with the right person, in the right circumstances\u2026.\u201d</p>\n<p>Fucking goddamn it, Stiles knew this was going to happen. Derek has feelings for him and Stiles is going to end up breaking his heart and everything is terrible. Except the way his body feels right now.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I\u2014usually I can control it, but you were in my bed this time, I\u2026.\u201d</p>\n<p>In fairness, Stiles is the one who crawled into a werewolf\u2019s bed while he was in the shower, and he didn\u2019t exactly protest when Derek initiated the sexytimes. Also\u2014\u201cDerek, the first time we fucked, I fried a sandbox. Criticizing you for losing control would be a little hypocritical.\u201d He pauses. \u201cPlus\u2026.\u201d</p>\n<p>Plus he\u2019s really feeling no pain at the moment. He closes his eyes and thrusts his ass against Derek\u2019s hips a little more firmly.</p>\n<p>Derek makes that sound again, the one Stiles doesn\u2019t have words for, and presses his open mouth to Stiles\u2019s collarbone.</p>\n<p>Stiles\u2019s throat goes dry. \u201cAre you\u2026 are you still\u2026?\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek nods.</p>\n<p>Holy fuck, that\u2019s so hot. Stiles\u2019s dick twitches against his stomach. \u201cOkay,\u201d he says faintly. \u201cSo you\u2019re not gonna mind if I\u2026.\u201d And he rolls his hips up again, rubbing his cock against Derek\u2019s stomach.</p>\n<p>Derek says, \u201cFuck.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles doesn\u2019t need more encouragement than that. \u201cYou, uh.\u201d He licks his lips and squirms. \u201cHave you tried this?\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek shudders and shakes his head against the side of Stiles\u2019s neck.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re missing out.\u201d He can\u2019t move far, not with Derek\u2019s\u2014damn it, Stiles has seen enough of the Internet to call it what it is\u2014<em>knot</em> tight against the rim of his asshole, but he doesn\u2019t have to. \u201cI\u2019m gonna\u2014I\u2019m not a werewolf, but I\u2019m a pretty good witch. I bet I could fake it.\u201d He wants, suddenly, to make Derek feel as good as he does, to splay him out on his belly and stretch his ass until it seems like his whole body might overload with lust. \u201cMake it feel like I was\u201d\u2014<em>say it</em>\u2014\u201c<em>knotting you</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek covers Stiles\u2019s mouth with his own, fierce, teeth stinging at Stiles\u2019s swollen lips. Just a few frantic, grinding movements, and then Stiles gets his hand on his dick, and\u2014</p>\n<p>He does pass out this time, but not for very long. When he comes to again Derek\u2019s cradling his face in one hand, looking pretty concerned for someone who\u2019s having a minutes-long orgasm. \u201cYou okay?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShhh, don\u2019t talk,\u201d Stiles says. He feels drunk with pleasure, like he couldn\u2019t get out of bed right now if his life depended on it. And actually he probably couldn\u2019t, because walking with Derek\u2019s dick stuck in his ass sounds like a terrible idea. \u201cYou\u2019re harshing my afterglow.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek snorts. \u201cI\u2019m going to move us, okay?\u201d</p>\n<p>Like Stiles could stop him, even if he could muster the brainpower to have an opinion on it one way or the other. He goes pliant and lets Derek maneuver them until they\u2019re spooned up together, Derek\u2019s chest to Stiles\u2019s back. Stiles breathes a little sigh of relief that Derek can\u2019t see his face anymore, that he doesn\u2019t have to watch Derek\u2019s expression. He can deal with Derek nuzzling his stubble against Stiles\u2019s shoulder instead. He\u2019s more used to that, has even come to like it. Before he knows it, he\u2019s closing his eyes again, his breath deepening as sleep takes him.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>\u201cGod, that\u2019s probably rude, huh?\u201d is the first thing Stiles says when he wakes up, feeling somehow lighter than he has in years. Derek\u2019s not behind him anymore, and there\u2019s no ooey gooey squishiness when he moves, so apparently Derek did all the cleanup work while Stiles was unconscious. \u201cSorry.\u201d</p>\n<p>At the foot of the bed, Derek looks up and raises one shoulder in a half shrug. \u201cI\u2019m the one who knotted you without your permission.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles decides the only way to go forward is to ignore Derek\u2019s massive guilt complex, thus giving the impression that said guilt is misplaced. He sits up, then has to bite back on a wince, because yeah, if he remembered about the hours-long drive ahead of them, he maybe would have put the kinky sex off until later. Oops. \u201cFinished packing?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah.\u201d He\u2019s dressed too, in different clothes than he wore earlier. He must not have shoved his entire wardrobe into the back of his car when he took off looking for Peter. He picks up a case from the floor and lays it on the bed. \u201cIt\u2019s just this and the books, really. I don\u2019t care about anything else.\u201d</p>\n<p>But Stiles is still staring at the case. It\u2019s about three feet long, black. \u201cPlease tell me there\u2019s a tommy gun in there.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek gives him a puzzled look. \u201cIt\u2019s a violin.\u201d</p>\n<p>Oh.</p>\n<p>Stiles continues to stare at it. \u201cYou play?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNot that well.\u201d Derek shrugs again. It makes Stiles forget how huge he is. \u201cPaige played cello. My therapist suggested it after she died. It helps.\u201d</p>\n<p>Oh <em>shit</em>.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s good,\u201d Stiles says, half strangled. \u201cThat it helps, I mean.\u201d Inside, he\u2019s in turmoil. Stiles is not prepared for this. Not on any level. He cast a spell and made himself sure, made falling in love an impossibility.</p>\n<p>Or so he thought.</p>\n<p>\u201cStiles? Are you okay? Your heartbeat\u2019s going crazy.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d Stiles manages, knowing Derek will hear the lie but trusting him not to push just yet. He draws on his magic to calm the rising anxiety, but even still, he\u2019s on the edge of a panic attack. He needs to be home, needs to tuck Rina into bed, maybe spend some time in the greenhouse.</p>\n<p>He needs to reread his old spellbooks.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d he says again, even though he might\u2019ve just signed Derek\u2019s death warrant. And then he takes a deep breath and screws his courage to the sticking place. If that\u2019s\u2014if he did that, then he has to draw the line. He can\u2019t lie to Derek anymore, not knowing how badly he\u2019s already been hurt. Not when he suspects what could be ahead. \u201cThere are some things I need to tell you. Things I haven\u2019t been totally honest about because they weren\u2019t my place.\u201d</p>\n<p>God damn it, Lydia.</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Derek says. He doesn\u2019t look surprised or disappointed or accusatory. That would make it easier.</p>\n<p>\u201cNext weekend, after Lydia tells you everything,\u201d Stiles promises. \u201cYou can ask me whatever you want and I\u2019ll answer.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Derek says again. Then he jerks his head toward the neatly folded pile of Stiles\u2019s clothes at the foot of the bed. \u201cYou should get dressed if we\u2019re going to pick up Rina before bedtime. Everything else can wait a week.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles nods, because what else can he do? \u201cOne week,\u201d he agrees.</p>\n<p>\n<em>If you don\u2019t hate me by then.</em>\n</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Sunday morning Stiles gets up before Derek and Rina and creeps down to the cupboard in the greenhouse to find his old spellbooks, thankful all the while that the aunts are intense about record-keeping. Intention, incantation, ingredients\u2014they\u2019re all equally important to the outcome, and sometimes the only way to reverse a spell is to break down exactly what went into it in the first place.</p>\n<p>Stiles knows better than to think this one can be reversed, but he takes out the book anyway, sits on the ground, and leans up against the wall to the house. The pages stick when he opens it, but it\u2019s easy to find the right entry.</p>\n<p>\n<em>When I fall in love, it\u2019ll be with someone strong. So strong they can lift a car. They\u2019ll be so beautiful everyone will want them, but so hurt underneath they\u2019ll never believe it.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>They\u2019ll have green eyes. No, brown. Yellow. Blue. Red. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>They\u2019ll play an instrument. Violin.</em>\n</p>\n<p><em>And their favorite TV show will be </em>Captain Planet<em>.</em></p>\n<p>Stiles smiles wistfully as he traces over his chicken-scratch printing. But the smile fades as he reads over the ingredient list. Acorn, silk cocoon, moss\u2014all those things he remembers adding. But at the bottom, in Lydia\u2019s much neater hand, is an addition he never considered.</p>\n<p><em>Moonlight</em>.</p>\n<p>He swallows and leans his head back against the siding. Of course.</p>\n<p>He closes the book and runs his fingers over the cover before returning it to the shelf. He\u2019ll probably have to show Derek eventually, but not now. He has a few days to build up to it.</p>\n<p>He spends them quietly freaking out. During the day he feels like he\u2019s walking on eggshells. At night he\u2019s plagued by visions of blue eyes burning into red, of maggots feasting on rotting flesh. Once he watches as a bloom of wolfsbane comes to life and wraps too tight around Derek\u2019s throat.</p>\n<p>Frustratingly, Derek continues to be perfect. Oh, he\u2019s quiet and a little sullen on occasion, and he has deplorable taste in sports teams. He\u2019s overly affectionate, which Stiles would probably love if he didn\u2019t feel so fucking <em>guilty</em> he has to pull away. Tuesday night, after Rina\u2019s in bed, Derek tries to put his arm around Stiles on the couch and Stiles actually has to stand up because he wants to lean into the touch so bad but his conscience won\u2019t let him.</p>\n<p>Derek\u2019s not in the living room when Stiles gets the courage to face him again, and he spends most of Wednesday with Scott.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat the hell did you do to him?\u201d Scott hisses to Stiles on Thursday, when he\u2019s on his lunch break. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t exactly Mr. Talkative before, but at least he wasn\u2019t an asshole.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles groans and barely resists the urge to put his head in his hands. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I fucked up, Scotty.\u201d</p>\n<p>For a second Scott doesn\u2019t say anything. Then he offers, hesitantly, \u201cThat sounds like a relationship thing.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut you don\u2019t have relationship things,\u201d Scott continues, managing to sound only vaguely accusatory, for which Stiles gives him mad props. \u201cBecause\u2014and I may be paraphrasing\u2014\u2018it\u2019s easier if people know up front not to expect something I can\u2019t give them.\u2019\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles presses a hand to his eyes. \u201cWell, that was my philosophy,\u201d he admits. \u201cBut I might have been operating under a false assumption.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo kidding,\u201d Scott deadpans.</p>\n<p>Even when Scott\u2019s the worst, he\u2019s still the best. \u201cThat spell I cast when I was ten, Scott. It was supposed to keep me from\u2026 that. Relationship thing.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt was supposed to make it impossible for you to fall in love,\u201d Scott corrects, because he\u2019s a grown-ass man and he\u2019s not afraid of the L-word. Damn him.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, that,\u201d Stiles agrees with a grimace. \u201cAnd the way I decided to do this was to enchant myself only to\u2014that\u2014with an impossible person. Someone with green brown yellow blue red eyes who could lift a car and play violin and loved <em>Captain Planet</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>Scott digests that for a minute. \u201cSo you\u2019re saying Derek is your Impossible Girl.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles takes back all the things he thought about Scott being a grown-up. And also regrets lending him his <em>Doctor Who</em> boxed sets. Still, his analogy is\u2026 not inaccurate. \u201cI don\u2019t know. Scott, I have literally never, you know. And if it is\u2014I cast that curse for a reason. You know what would happen.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t. And neither do you, really. Even you can\u2019t tell the future, Stiles.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, but I can learn from the past.\u201d Stiles sighs. \u201cAnyway, that\u2019s only half of the problem. I can\u2019t tell you the rest yet. I don\u2019t know. I need to tell Derek, but I can\u2019t do it until Lydia\u2019s home, and it\u2019s going to ruin everything.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI guess you\u2019ll find out when Lydia gets home tomorrow night.\u201d There\u2019s a pause, then a crunch\u2014probably Scott shoving the last of his baby carrots in his mouth. \u201cI gotta go, my lunch is over. But call me if you need me later, okay?\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles must have been a good person in a previous life to have earned a friend like Scott. \u201cSure, buddy. I\u2019ll do that.\u201d</p>\n<p>A few minutes after school lets out, Derek arrives with Rina, his head bowed. Stiles and Rina exchange hugs and kisses, and then she and Derek retreat to the small back room to play a board game.</p>\n<p>Or so Stiles assumes, until Derek reemerges, still downcast. \u201cHey.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles swallows the lump in his throat. \u201cHey back.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cRina says we should talk about why we\u2019re sad.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles\u2019s lips curve up in a wry smile without his brain\u2019s explicit permission. \u201cWelcome to the world of being parented by a five-year-old.\u201d But the smile falls away when Derek just nods, the muscles at his jaw bunching. \u201cLook, I\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cStiles\u2014\u201d Derek starts at the same time.</p>\n<p>They both break off and stare at each other in a display of mutual discomfort. <em>Yay, communication</em>, Stiles thinks. \u201cYou go first.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek looks like the idea of talking about this actually physically pains him. Not that Stiles can throw stones on that front. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I pulled away from you when you got up the other night. You were upfront about what I could expect from you. I don\u2019t have any right to be hurt.\u201d</p>\n<p>Oh God, what a clusterfuck. \u201cDerek. I don\u2019t have any business telling you how you can or can\u2019t feel. That\u2019s horseshit.\u201d Stiles takes a deep breath and tries to will away the guilt eating at his stomach. \u201cAnd I wish I could have this adult conversation with you right now, but until Lydia tells you the rest of the story with Peter, I really can\u2019t. I\u2019m not even sure you\u2019ll want to talk to me afterwards.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek nods and looks down at his hands. \u201cSo what now?\u201d</p>\n<p>Fuck everything. \u201cNow we might as well enjoy this while we can,\u201d Stiles decides. One more night won\u2019t make any difference at this point.</p>\n<p>\u201cEnjoying this while they can\u201d translates to taking Joey and Rina out for pizza and the early show at the movies, since Stiles owes Scott babysitting duties for approximately the next five years. No one is ever too old for Pixar, Stiles explains seriously to Derek as he grabs approximately seven hundred napkins. Kid fingers plus theater butter crap\u2014it\u2019s a disaster waiting to happen.</p>\n<p>Derek\u2019s not exactly a natural with kids, but they get along well enough, especially when Rina demands, and is given, a ride on Derek\u2019s shoulders. He doesn\u2019t even complain when she gets butter in his hair.</p>\n<p>They drop Joey off with his collectable toy just before nine; Kira answers the door in threadbare pj\u2019s with a glow you could probably see from space. Stiles doesn\u2019t mean the kitsune thing either. Maybe Derek and Scott have more than just the werewolf thing in common.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey, guys.\u201d She hugs Joey and sends him up to bed\u2014it\u2019s a school night, after all\u2014then turns back to the adults and smiles. \u201cYou must be Derek. I can\u2019t thank you enough for helping Scott out. The learning curve was pretty steep at the beginning there.\u201d</p>\n<p>Judging by the surprise on Derek\u2019s face, people don\u2019t thank him very often. \u201cIt was no problem,\u201d he says, a kind of awkward earnestness to his expression that seems out of sync with his status as an alpha. \u201cWerewolves need a pack. Scott\u2019s is a little untraditional, but it\u2019s a good one. He\u2019s lucky to have you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Oh, Stiles thinks. He feels like he\u2019s just taken an arrow to the chest.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, you know, we\u2019re pretty lucky too,\u201d Kira says, not a bit smugly, glancing back over her shoulder, where Scott has Joey slung over his back and is carrying him up the stairs to bed. \u201cThanks for taking Joey out tonight.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt was the least we could do,\u201d Stiles assures her. \u201cBut we\u2019d better get going. Rina\u2019s already asleep in the car. Have a good night.\u201d</p>\n<p>When they get home, Derek carries her up the stairs, bridal style. Stiles pulls back the covers and gets her out of her shoes and pants while Derek digs in the dresser for her pajamas. It\u2019s all very domestic, doing this with someone else, someone who\u2019s not the aunts. Stiles is afraid of how much he likes it.</p>\n<p>He pulls the covers up again and kisses Rina\u2019s forehead. Then he grabs Derek\u2019s hand, leads him into his bedroom, and takes him apart.</p>\n<p>For the first time in two weeks, Derek falls asleep first, in the middle of a postorgasmic conversation on the merits of Batman versus Superman. Stiles would be offended except he\u2019s sort of pleased with himself for wearing Derek out so thoroughly. He never even considers kicking him back to his own room, just turns over until he\u2019s comfortable and closes his eyes.</p>\n<p>He dreams of alpha red fading to lifeless green-brown and wakes up sweating, panting for breath, with Derek\u2019s arm a firm, steadying weight around his waist.</p>\n<p>Just a dream, Stiles tells himself firmly. Derek snuffles his face into his shoulder and Stiles makes himself go back to sleep.</p>\n<p>So of course Rina wakes them up in the morning. So much for Derek\u2019s alpha werewolf hearing saving them from awkward moments. \u201cUncle Stiles!\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles inhales deeply, rubs the sleep from his eyes, and turns to look over the side of the bed. \u201cHi, princess.\u201d</p>\n<p>Obviously unwilling to break with her usual Friday morning routine, Rina climbs into bed\u2014where Stiles is actually naked, with another man, who is also naked\u2014and flops down in the middle.</p>\n<p>Derek doesn\u2019t move. Wow, Stiles\u2019s ego is going to be out of control after this. If he doesn\u2019t die of mortification first, anyway.</p>\n<p>Rina looks doubtfully at Derek\u2019s naked back, seeming to take particular interest in the triskelion tattoo. Stiles sighs, knowing he won\u2019t be able to veto her future love interests based on their ink. Then she turns back to Stiles and asks very seriously, \u201cIs Derek your boyfriend?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLet\u2019s talk about that later,\u201d Stiles says diplomatically. \u201cCan you run down to the kitchen and turn on the coffeemaker for me?\u201d</p>\n<p>Rina narrows her eyes. \u201cCan we still get McDonald\u2019s?\u201d</p>\n<p>Dammit, he\u2019s raising a mercenary. Oh well. At least she wants fast food and not a pony. \u201cOf course.\u201d</p>\n<p>She manages to dig her elbow into his gut and her knee into his thigh as she climbs back over him on her way out the door. Stiles suffers in relative silence as penance for being caught naked in bed with Derek by a five-year-old.</p>\n<p>When Rina thunders down the last step, Stiles nudges Derek\u2019s shoulder. \u201cHey, Captain Comatose. You awake?\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek grunts.</p>\n<p>Stiles pokes him again. \u201cSeriously?\u201d He swings his legs over the side of the bed and starts rooting around for some pants. \u201cWhere was your superhearing on that one, huh?\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek rolls over and rubs at his eyes. \u201cSorry. Full moon tonight. Makes me sleep heavier.\u201d</p>\n<p>So much for Stiles\u2019s ego boost. \u201cWell, you slept through Rina\u2019s inquisition. Luckily she cares more about breakfast than the naked guy in her uncle\u2019s bed.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wincing, Derek sits up and immediately hunches over, reminding Stiles of a scolded dog. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p>\n<p>Now Stiles just feels like an asshole. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it. I don\u2019t want to be the kind of parent who lies to their kid anyway.\u201d Which means he should probably revisit the whole werewolves exist conversation at some point. Not until he coordinates with Scott, though.</p>\n<p>He shakes it off. \u201cCome on, Friday means McDonald\u2019s breakfast. My treat.\u201d</p>\n<p>After all, he probably only has a few hours left to enjoy this, and he\u2019s going to be spending most of them at work.</p>\n<p>In case of yelling, screaming, or the digging up of dead bodies, Stiles arranges for Scott to pick Rina up from school. And then there\u2019s nothing to do but go to work and wait.</p>\n<p>Lydia texts him just after noon. <em>Leaving now.</em></p>\n<p>Stiles\u2019s stomach tightens with dread.</p>\n<p>The rest of the afternoon, he can\u2019t shake the feeling. Goose bumps rise on the back of his neck. The skin under his fingernails itches, and his mouth tastes sour, like he might throw up. By one o\u2019clock the urge to go home is unbearable. Stiles locks the front door, picks up his backpack from the back, and snags one of the heavy walking sticks he keeps around for tourist season. The magic calls to him, whispering to hurry.</p>\n<p>The last time Stiles felt like this, his mother was dying.</p>\n<p>Despite his sense of impending dread, the sun is shining. The sky is clear. When he reaches the house, Lydia\u2019s car is parked behind Derek\u2019s.</p>\n<p>As he walks up the driveway, his gaze is drawn to the plot of land behind the house where they buried Peter. Stiles stares at it for a moment, knowing it doesn\u2019t look right.</p>\n<p>Then he realizes the flowers are gone.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh <em>shit</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>Before he even puts it all together, Stiles breaks into a run, following the urgent tug in his chest. He rounds the back of the house just in time to see Lydia blow a handful of purple petals into Derek\u2019s face.</p>\n<p>Derek drops like a stone.</p>\n<p>Lydia turns toward Stiles and he almost stops in his tracks. Her eyes are limned in red and her face shows no hint of recognition. The neckline of the shirt she\u2019s wearing doesn\u2019t cover her bite, and the unbandaged wound is red, festering.</p>\n<p>Stiles sweeps out with his walking stick and knocks her unconscious before she can dope him too.</p>\n<p><em>Well</em>, Stiles thinks, looking down at two limp bodies on the grass. <em>Now what?</em></p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>With only a moderate amount of difficulty, Stiles carries Lydia inside. Right now she\u2019s the threat, or whatever\u2019s inside her is, anyway, and he needs to get her secured. He\u2019s sweating by the time he lays her body on the floor in the attic, but he doesn\u2019t have time to take a breather. He shuffles off his pack and pulls out the bag of mountain ash he burned earlier. At least now he knows what it\u2019s for.</p>\n<p>From the shelf by the door, he takes a silver knife and a small crucible, which he fills halfway with ash. Then, gritting his teeth, he slices into his palm and holds it over the bowl. The mountain ash would probably work on its own, for a while at least. But with his blood as a binding agent, it\u2019ll be stronger, last longer. May be gentler on Lydia too.</p>\n<p>When the mixture is thin enough to paint with, Stiles licks across his cut and murmurs a word of healing to stop the blood flow. Then he dips two fingers in the bowl and traces a six-foot-diameter pentagram on the wood floor, leaving the lines open at one end. After depositing Lydia in the middle, he closes the circle, feeling the barrier snap into place.</p>\n<p>That\u2019s one body down.</p>\n<p>Stiles sets the crucible back on the shelf and washes his hands carefully before trudging back down two flights of stairs and into the greenhouse for supplies. He sincerely hopes he can wake Derek up, because carrying him will be a lot more difficult.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s still a handful of petals and pollen on the ground near Derek\u2019s face, so Stiles gathers it up to take a look. They\u2019re poisonous, of course, but not deadly. Derek will probably wake up on his own in a few minutes. But Stiles is anxious and doesn\u2019t want to wait, so he reaches for his spark and ignites the petals before holding them in front of Derek\u2019s nose.</p>\n<p>Slowly, Derek opens his eyes. \u201cStiles?\u201d He pushes up on his elbows, then seems to think better of it, falling limply back to the grass. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d</p>\n<p>The sixty-four-thousand-dollar question. Stiles opens his mouth to say <em>I don\u2019t know</em>, but the truth comes out instead. \u201cI think your dead uncle\u2019s possessing my sister.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek stares at him for a long moment. \u201cMaybe we should have that talk now.\u201d</p>\n<p>They probably should. Unfortunately\u2014\u201cWe\u2019ll have to multitask,\u201d Stiles says, getting to his feet and then extending a hand to help Derek up. \u201cI have a feeling it\u2019s going to be a long day.\u201d</p>\n<p>Why does the shit have to hit the fan when the aunts are on vacation?</p>\n<p>Inside, Stiles helps Derek to the couch and reaches for the phone. Not surprisingly, he gets Aunt Hestia\u2019s voice mail. She\u2019s always forgetting to charge her cell.</p>\n<p>\u201cHello, you\u2019ve reached Hestia Martin. I\u2019m currently out of the office. If this is regarding business, please leave a message and I\u2019ll return your call as soon as possible. If this is Stiles, the answers you\u2019re looking for are in the book on the table next to the bed.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles hangs up and looks at the phone. Derek does too. Finally he asks, \u201cWas that weird?\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles is forced to shake his head. \u201cNo, uh, Aunt Hestia\u2019s got the Sight, so. This happens every once in a while.\u201d He sighs. If he were a better nephew, he\u2019d have called and gotten that message earlier, and then all of this could\u2019ve been prevented. \u201cI\u2019ll be right back.\u201d</p>\n<p>He finds the book exactly where Hestia said it would be, on the table beside her bed. <em>Days of the Wolf</em>, the cover reads. There\u2019s a bookmark sticking out of it. Underneath is a copy of a book Stiles has read before, <em>Practical Exorcisms</em>. Oh good. Now he\u2019s prepared.</p>\n<p>When he gets back to the living room, Derek\u2019s color has returned, and he\u2019s sitting up straight on the couch, mouth a thin line. Stiles guesses it\u2019s about time for that conversation.</p>\n<p>He slides the books onto the coffee table and lowers himself carefully to the couch, keeping a full cushion\u2019s worth of space between himself and Derek.</p>\n<p>Derek says, \u201cJust tell me.\u201d His face is scrunched up and his posture is defensive, like he\u2019s bracing himself for a physical blow.</p>\n<p>Stiles takes a deep breath and says, \u201cLydia killed Peter.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek doesn\u2019t react, at least not outwardly, so Stiles swallows and fills the silence. \u201cWhen they first met, she thought he was someone else, and they started an affair. Then she figured out who he really was and what he was doing. He bit her, and she lit him on fire.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek winces, but that\u2019s the extent of his reaction. Stiles might as well finish the story.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd then she called me, and we buried him in the backyard. You showed up the next day.\u201d</p>\n<p>Leaning forward, Derek puts his head in his hands. His voice is very quiet when he says, \u201cHe burned to death.\u201d</p>\n<p>Fuck. \u201cYeah,\u201d Stiles whispers.</p>\n<p>For a long time, Derek doesn\u2019t move or say anything. He\u2019s frozen in his own world. Then he says, \u201cYou should have told me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI wanted to,\u201d Stiles says hoarsely. \u201cEver since the first day, I wanted to. But it wasn\u2019t my place to tell you, not when Lydia was the one who\u2026. And of course it probably wasn\u2019t even her.\u201d He picks up the book from the table and flips it open to the page Hestia bookmarked. \u201cWhat do you know about the Worm Moon?\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek looks over and shakes his head. Not much, apparently.</p>\n<p>Stiles puts the book between them. \u201cThis is the page Hestia bookmarked.\u201d It\u2019s an old book, and it looks like the information has been copied from something even older; there\u2019s a woodcut illustration depicting a skeletal man with sharp teeth who\u2019s digging claws into the arm of a robust young woman.</p>\n<p>He clears his throat. \u201cApparently there\u2019s a ritual that allows a dead werewolf to steal power from an alpha and return to life, assuming they have a living accomplice.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek raises his eyes to the ceiling. \u201cThe bite. She\u2019s immune to turning, but being an alpha comes with other powers\u2026.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Stiles nods. \u201cWhich brings me to part two.\u201d He closes <em>Days of the Wolf</em> and holds up <em>Practical Exorcisms</em>. \u201cThe longer we wait, the stronger his hold. I know I\u2019m probably not your favorite person right now, but I\u2019d appreciate your help if you\u2019re willing.\u201d</p>\n<p>Upstairs, something thumps loudly. With a sigh, Derek finally meets Stiles\u2019s gaze. \u201cTell me what you need me to do.\u201d</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>All expectations to the contrary, Stiles has never performed an exorcism before. He\u2019s never even heard of the aunts performing one. In light of that, he decides he\u2019d better call in the experts.</p>\n<p>He calls Deaton first. \u201cSo Lydia\u2019s been possessed by a dead alpha werewolf and I could use your backup,\u201d Stiles says when Deaton answers the phone at the clinic.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a pause. Then Stiles remembers: \u201cThis is Stiles Stilinski, by the way.\u201d His father took his mother\u2019s name when they married, as part of the traditional fuck-you to their ancestors.</p>\n<p>\u201cI have two surgeries left this afternoon,\u201d Deaton says smoothly. \u201cSeven o\u2019clock okay?\u201d</p>\n<p>Google informed Stiles that moonrise is at eight thirty. Peter\u2019s power will start strengthening then and reach its height as the moon reaches its apogee. \u201cThat should work.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cVery well. Will you be needing to speak to Mr. McCall?\u201d</p>\n<p>Oh, good idea. Two birds, one stone. \u201cIf he\u2019s available? I can call back or text him if this is a bad time.\u201d</p>\n<p>He can practically hear the eye roll. \u201cJust hold a minute.\u201d</p>\n<p>Scott picks up less than two seconds later, obviously having overheard the entire conversation\u2014werewolf hearing. \u201cDid you say <em>possessed</em>?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Stiles licks his lips and leans back against the couch. \u201cListen, Scotty, take the kids to your mom\u2019s tonight, just in case. I don\u2019t think he\u2019s got a beef with you or them, but just\u2014just in case. You\u2019re strong enough to protect them.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat about you? What about Kira?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m going to need Kira here. She can take care of herself. And we\u2019ve got Derek too. We should be okay.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIf you\u2019re sure,\u201d Scott says doubtfully.</p>\n<p>Stiles is not at all sure, but he makes himself sound confident anyway. \u201cThanks, Scotty. See you on the other side.\u201d</p>\n<p>Goddess help him, he can\u2019t think about the possibility that this might cost Rina another parental figure. It\u2019s not an option he can consider right now.</p>\n<p>He gets through the rest of the roster as quickly as possible. Marin hates him, but not as much as she hates the idea of a psychotic alpha werewolf running amok in Half Moon Bay, so she\u2019ll show up. Stiles has a pretty good relationship with the local priest, who agrees to attend as well. Some people would consider it crossing the metaphysical streams, but Stiles prefers to think of it as covering the bases. Between his witchiness, Marin and Deaton\u2019s druid abilities, and the father\u2019s abilities, they should be safe.</p>\n<p>That\u2019s the first part covered. Before he starts the next step, he checks on Lydia.</p>\n<p>Or whoever\u2019s inhabiting her body.</p>\n<p>When he closes the door behind him, she sits up, her hair in disarray. When her gaze lands on him, her mouth curls up in a slow smile and she drawls, \u201cStiles.\u201d</p>\n<p>So not Lydia, then.</p>\n<p>\u201cPeter.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve heard so much about you.\u201d The tone alone send chills down Stiles\u2019s spine; coupled with the way Peter moves Lydia\u2019s body, it\u2019s enough to make Stiles\u2019s gorge rise. \u201cA powerful witch by all accounts. You\u2019d make a valuable asset to my pack. Just say the word.\u201d He licks his lips, sliding closer to the edge of the pentagram.</p>\n<p>Stiles steps back in disgust. \u201cAre you trying to seduce me while wearing my sister? I knew you were a sociopath, but have a little common decency.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSilly me,\u201d Peter says smoothly. \u201cI forgot. Still, one must work with what one\u2019s been given.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLydia didn\u2019t <em>give</em> you anything.\u201d</p>\n<p>Waving a hand idly, Peter dismisses, \u201cA figure of speech, of course. But really, Stiles, I have to thank you. Without you, my nephew never would have stuck around long enough for me to implement my backup plan.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles\u2019s stomach feels hollow.</p>\n<p>\u201cReally, he\u2019s going to die anyway, isn\u2019t he? Tell you what. Let me have him and I\u2019ll give you your sister back. No harm, no foul.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you going to monologue like a cartoon villain this whole time?\u201d Stiles snaps, thinking of a body in the woods, unburied and unremembered. \u201cBecause if you are\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>He snaps his fingers. A spark leaps from his fist to the edge of the pentagram, then up Lydia\u2019s hand to her throat. Peter goes limp.</p>\n<p>Huh, Stiles thinks. The benefits to using your own blood in a spell: only Stiles\u2019s magic can cross the pentagram. Interesting.</p>\n<p>A second later Lydia sits up again, herself this time. \u201cGet him <em>out of me</em>, Stiles,\u201d she says through gritted teeth. \u201cIt\u2019s like having Iago doing a running commentary in my head at all times. And that\u2019s when he lets me drive.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles blinks. \u201cFrom <em>Aladdin</em>?\u201d</p>\n<p>Lydia rolls her eyes. \u201cFrom <em>Othello</em>, genius.\u201d She sighs. \u201cWhat did you do to him, anyway?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMagic gag order. It\u2019ll probably only last a few minutes; he gets stronger the closer we get to the full moon. Do you need anything?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cJust the exorcism, please. I can\u2019t believe it took you this long to catch on.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles flushes. \u201cIt\u2019s not like you were <em>around</em>!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMm-hmm,\u201d Lydia says, one corner of her mouth drawing up in a knowing smirk. \u201cAnd I\u2019m sure you weren\u2019t at all distracted by the presence of Tall, Dark, and Artfully Stubbled.\u201d</p>\n<p>She means it as a joke\u2014he knows that. But it\u2019s true. It\u2019s probably already too late for Derek, and Stiles almost lost Lydia too. He can feel his face crumpling in on itself as emotion wells in his throat, and <em>Goddess</em>, he can\u2019t lose it now, he doesn\u2019t have time\u2014</p>\n<p>The door opens behind him, startling him into regaining control. Derek looks down with a concerned expression. \u201cEverything okay in here?\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles takes a shuddery breath just as Lydia rolls her neck and looks up, Peter in control once more. \u201cNo,\u201d Stiles says honestly. \u201cYou stay with Peter. I have calls to make.\u201d</p>\n<p>The thing about exorcisms is that while they\u2019re essentially designed to get things that shouldn\u2019t be there <em>out</em>, it\u2019s equally if not more important to keep the things that <em>should</em> be there <em>in</em>. There are five points on the pentagram, corresponding to four anchors and a lure. Derek\u2019s the lure\u2014obvious\u2014but Stiles needs three more anchors who won\u2019t freak out. And of course, in order to be successful anchors, they have to be people with connections to Lydia. Not so easy with the aunts out of town.</p>\n<p>Stiles calls Kira first. She\u2019s probably the weakest connection, but she and Lydia have known each other for a few years, and they\u2019re both supernatural creatures, so there\u2019s that. She\u2019s representing Community anyway, so the link doesn\u2019t have to be that strong.</p>\n<p>The other three anchors, though. They have to be perfect.</p>\n<p>Stiles is strong enough to stand for Family and perform the exorcism at the same time. But that still leaves Heart and Friendship to be filled, and that\u2019s going to be awkward.</p>\n<p>Well, there\u2019s nothing for it. Stiles thumbs through his contacts and dials Jackson Whittemore.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat do you want, Stilinski?\u201d</p>\n<p>Charming as always. Fuck him. Stiles was going to ease into this conversation, but Jackson doesn\u2019t deserve the consideration. \u201cYour help saving Lydia\u2019s life. She\u2019s being possessed.\u201d</p>\n<p>A pause. \u201c<em>What</em>?\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles sighs. \u201cLook, you know the rumors about the aunts? True. I\u2019m a witch. Lydia\u2019s a banshee. The guy possessing her is a werewolf. If we don\u2019t get him out tonight, he might be able to take over completely, so I need you to come over tonight. Seven o\u2019clock. Ask your wife if you don\u2019t believe me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Another pause. \u201cYou better not be fucking with me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLook, I wouldn\u2019t call you if\u2014\u201d Stiles grits his teeth and swallows his pride. \u201cI\u2019ve never liked you. You\u2019ve never liked me. But for some reason Lydia\u2019s fond of you, and that\u2014that might save her life, if you come tonight, so please. I am begging you. Seven o\u2019clock.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Jackson says finally. \u201cFine. But if I find out this was a hoax\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI swear to Goddess I\u2019m telling the truth.\u201d Fuck it, he\u2019s going to owe Jackson Whittemore.</p>\n<p>Now for the worst part. \u201cListen. What\u2019s your wife\u2019s number?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMy\u2014what are you going to do, Stilinski? Tattle? I thought you said you wanted my help.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI do!\u201d Stiles snarls. \u201cYou just better hope she can forgive Lydia for sleeping with you, because I need hers too.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jackson gives him the number.</p>\n<p>Stiles allows himself a moment of embittered silence before punching in the numbers.</p>\n<p>She picks up on the third ring. \u201cHello?\u201d</p>\n<p>And Stiles is suddenly, unequivocally exhausted. \u201cHi, Allison.\u201d</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>In high school, Erica Reyes was Stiles\u2019s best friend. Allison Argent was Lydia\u2019s.</p>\n<p>The aunts had mentioned the Argents\u2014that they knew things, that they could be allies or enemies depending on their interpretation of your actions. Stiles took those veiled warnings to heart and kept his distance. Lydia, though\u2014Lydia had never met a boundary she didn\u2019t test.</p>\n<p>It probably helped that Allison was sugar-sweet with a killer fashion sense and seemed content to play second fiddle to Lydia, who would never tolerate a usurper. Lydia dated Jackson more or less exclusively. Allison dated Scott and then, later, whoever she liked.</p>\n<p>Then they graduated and Lydia went to MIT. Allison and Jackson stayed local and, apparently, bonded out of mutual loneliness.</p>\n<p>Or, if you\u2019re bitter, protective, and inclined to see the worst in people when it suits you, Allison got tired of being second chair.</p>\n<p>Stiles has always taken things more personally than Lydia.</p>\n<p>\u201cStiles,\u201d she says now, sounding surprised to hear from him. Surprised, and naturally suspicious. Well, she would be; Stiles has never gotten the hang of masking his feelings. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles sees no point in sugarcoating it. \u201cThe werewolf who murdered your aunt Kate is possessing Lydia and I need you to help me get him out.\u201d</p>\n<p>To her credit, Allison doesn\u2019t even sound surprised. \u201cThat was a werewolf?\u201d She sounds like she\u2019s about ready to start hunting for her crossbow. Stiles doesn\u2019t have time for that.</p>\n<p>\u201cA werewolf whose family your aunt murdered in cold blood by seducing a minor.\u201d Allison\u2019s not close with her family for reasons Stiles completely agrees with, but he\u2019s not above reinforcing the whys of that when it suits him. \u201cAnd then burning them alive. Not that this is in any way about your aunt,\u201d he adds when he remembers he needs a favor. \u201cI know you and Lydia don\u2019t speak much anymore, but I don\u2019t have anyone else to ask, Allison. Please.\u201d</p>\n<p>She only deliberates for half a second. \u201cWhat time do you need me?\u201d</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Which means, of course, that Stiles has to explain her presence to Derek. \u201cCan I talk to you for a second?\u201d he asks at normal volume, perfectly aware Derek can hear him through two floors.</p>\n<p>He comes down the stairs a minute later with a face like a storm cloud. Stiles doesn\u2019t blame him; he only spent a few minutes in Peter\u2019s company and it ruined his day. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d</p>\n<p>Like ripping off a Band-Aid, Stiles tells himself. \u201cOne of the anchors I need for the exorcism is Kate Argent\u2019s niece.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek sags onto the couch. \u201cOh good. I was just thinking what today needed was a grim reminder of my past.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles huffs in agreement and thinks about the bottle of Jack in the kitchen cupboard. \u201cTell me about it. Hey, can werewolves get drunk?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIf we try really hard,\u201d Derek says, sounding like he\u2019s thinking about it. \u201cAnd with the right kind of wolfsbane.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll make a note,\u201d Stiles says. For Scott\u2019s sake, of course, since after this clusterfuck Derek will probably never speak to him again. He gives himself five minutes to sit and brood, and then he gets up. He has preparations to make.</p>\n<p>Kira shows up at quarter to seven. \u201cGot tired of watching the clock,\u201d she explains with a small smile. Stiles steps aside to let her in.</p>\n<p>Deaton and Marin arrive together a few minutes after that. Stiles offers tea or coffee and receives, respectively, a polite \u201cno, thank you\u201d and dagger glares in response, so he counts that as a win.</p>\n<p>\u201cKira and Lydia are in the attic with Derek. The lure,\u201d he elaborates for Marin. \u201cYou can go on up. Everyone else should be arriving shortly.\u201d</p>\n<p>Before the words are even out of his mouth, a Porsche pulls up behind Derek\u2019s Camaro. Jackson and Allison both step out, which Stiles finds supremely weird.</p>\n<p>\u201cTea and coffee in the kitchen,\u201d he says as Jackson brushes past him. \u201cLydia\u2019s in the attic.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jackson barely grunts in acknowledgment as he follows Deaton and Marin, but Allison hangs back.</p>\n<p>Stiles finds himself fighting back a sudden crushing wave of gratitude. \u201cThanks,\u201d he says thickly, grasping her wrist. \u201cFor coming, I know it was probably\u2026 I know there\u2019s probably a hundred things you\u2019d rather be doing.\u201d</p>\n<p>Allison\u2019s sweet brown eyes go liquid soft. \u201cStiles\u2026.\u201d She shakes her head. \u201cI know you think what everyone thinks. And that\u2019s my fault. I didn\u2019t want anyone to know, I\u2026.\u201d She bites her lip and looks off to one side.</p>\n<p>Intrigued, Stiles waits.</p>\n<p>\u201cLydia and I reconciled over a year ago,\u201d she finally says. \u201cAnd even if we hadn\u2019t, I\u2019m not sure I like the insinuation that I would\u2019ve let her die because she occasionally fucks my husband.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles actually takes a half a step back in shock. \u201cUh,\u201d he says, wondering how he managed to get his foot so far in his mouth this time. \u201cThat\u2019s not what I\u2014I\u2019m sorry. That\u2019s not what I meant to imply at all. I knew you\u2019d come if I asked. It was just really uncomfortable asking? This is coming out all wrong.\u201d He scrubs a hand through his hair and wishes he\u2019d had time for a nap this afternoon. He\u2019s already exhausted. \u201cHow do you get over your best friend sleeping with your husband, anyway?\u201d</p>\n<p>Allison winces. \u201cWell, it\u2019s a lot easier when your husband isn\u2019t the only one having an affair.\u201d</p>\n<p>Oh boy. So that\u2019s why they\u2019re keeping up the pretense of not being friends\u2014to draw attention away from what must be an even more illicit and gossipworthy pairing. \u201cOookay then,\u201d he says. \u201cWell. You know where the attic is. We\u2019re just waiting for one more and then we can start.\u201d</p>\n<p>Allison nods tightly and makes a beeline for the stairs.</p>\n<p>Before Stiles even has the door closed, Father Isaac melts out of the shadows and onto the porch. It\u2019s creepy every time he does it, not that Stiles has him over often. Their ideologies conflict on a number of levels, though they\u2019re complementary on many others. Still, he\u2019s a nice enough guy once you get to know him.</p>\n<p>\u201cFather,\u201d Stiles acknowledges with a lift of his head. \u201cThank you for coming.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGotta protect my flock,\u201d Father Isaac says with a half shake of his head. \u201cEspecially the ones who stray.\u201d</p>\n<p>Good enough for Stiles. He closes the door behind both of them and leads the way upstairs.</p>\n<p>The atmosphere in the attic is understandably tense, considering it contains a group of people who don\u2019t know each other very well, plus a pair with a longstanding family history of antagonism and murder, plus a creepy werewolf possessing Stiles\u2019s sister.</p>\n<p>Everyone stops what they\u2019re doing when Stiles and Father Isaac walk in, and Peter folds Lydia\u2019s body into a seductive pose and purrs, \u201cStiles. Have you reconsidered my offer?\u201d</p>\n<p>And just, nope. Stiles snaps his fingers with a little too much intent behind it, because the spark that jumps from his fingers to the pentagram and into Lydia leaves her completely limp. Oops.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell,\u201d he says sheepishly, resisting the urge to rub the back of his neck. \u201cLet\u2019s get to work.\u201d</p>\n<p>Quickly, he and Derek secure Lydia\u2019s wrists and ankles to the heavy-duty D-rings Derek screwed into the floor outside the pentagram earlier. Stiles adjusts the length of the chain to keep her hands and feet inside the circle, just at the points of the star, and tries to make sure the leather is tight enough to hold and soft enough not to leave marks. He really hopes Miranda at the sex shop never finds out he\u2019s using today\u2019s purchase on his sister.</p>\n<p>No sooner has Stiles tightened the last restraint than Lydia opens her eyes. \u201cStiles?\u201d</p>\n<p>It\u2019s definitely her this time, and Stiles gives her a tight smile he knows doesn\u2019t reach his eyes. \u201cHey, sis. I called your moms. They left me some advice.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lydia lifts her head a bit to look down at her body, then turns back to Stiles and raises an eyebrow.</p>\n<p>\u201cWow, stop with the judgey face. Those restraints are <em>new</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUgh,\u201d Jackson says, making a face, and oh yeah, Stiles might as well point out that\u2014\u201cYou\u2019ve got visitors.\u201d</p>\n<p>He absolutely doesn\u2019t get choked up when he sees the tears in Jackson\u2019s eyes as he takes Lydia\u2019s hand, or the brave smile Allison gives her.</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay,\u201d he says. \u201cLet\u2019s get this exorcism on the road. Jackson, left hand.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jackson presses a sappy kiss to Lydia\u2019s fingers before walking around the pentagram\u2014apparently he does have some sense\u2014to the other side, closest to Lydia\u2019s heart.</p>\n<p>\u201cAllison, right hand, please. Kira, left ankle.\u201d Stiles settles his crucible beside him on the floor and reopens the wound in his hand. He\u2019ll need fresh blood for this. \u201cDerek, you know what to do.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek nods and opens the window behind him. Three stories down, there\u2019s a big hole in the ground with a body in it. Stiles has saturated it with salt and gasoline and warded it against anyone coming across it by accident. He\u2019s nothing if not thorough.</p>\n<p>Derek kneels by Lydia\u2019s head, then leans over so he\u2019s looking upside-down into her face. Stiles can <em>feel</em> it when he flashes red eyes at her, and the floor vibrates when he rumbles, \u201cPeter.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lydia goes still and Stiles <em>sees</em> it the moment she changes, the moment Lydia fades to the background and Peter comes to the front. Her mouth opens and Derek pushes part of a scuba mouthpiece into it to hold it that way and prevent Peter from speaking.</p>\n<p>Stiles takes a deep breath and tries to center himself. He needs to be calm, to focus on his sister and everything she is. \u201cI need everyone to concentrate on Lydia right now. Focus on what she means to you, on your memories of her, anything that\u2019s particularly strong. Preferably a good memory,\u201d he adds. \u201cDerek, I need you to do the same with Peter. Pleasant memories will work best, if you have any.\u201d</p>\n<p>Then he swallows and looks back over his shoulder. \u201cYou guys are ready with your backups?\u201d</p>\n<p>Marin and Deaton nod. Isaac shifts his stance, and Stiles swears he hears the rustle of feathers.</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay.\u201d But he\u2019s trying his way first.</p>\n<p>\u201cDanu, Brighid, \u00c1ine, Cl\u00edodhna, \u00c9riu.\u201d As he invokes the goddesses, the wind outside picks up, and a breeze blows through the room, ruffling the hair on the back of Stiles\u2019s neck. \u201cI call on you to protect our sister and banish Peter Hale.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter strains against the bonds, but they hold fast. Lydia\u2019s body doesn\u2019t have a werewolf\u2019s strength.</p>\n<p>\u201cCl\u00edodhna, patron of our family, lend her the strength of her ancestors.\u201d Stiles dips his free hand in the crucible and then wraps it around Lydia\u2019s ankle. The skin feels hot beneath his palm, and her body jerks, but he can feel her aura; it\u2019s not doing her physical damage. He passes the bowl to Kira.</p>\n<p>\u201c\u00c9riu, matron of this community, anchor her here that we may keep her with us.\u201d</p>\n<p>Kira repeats Stiles\u2019s handprint on the other ankle. Peter\u2019s thrashing intensifies. The air in the room grows cold as the wind whips through it, charged with an energy that dances over Stiles\u2019s skin.</p>\n<p>Kira sets the crucible down on her other side, next to Allison.</p>\n<p>\u201cBrighid, friend of knowledge, fill her with your light and cast away the shadow.\u201d</p>\n<p>Allison adds a bloody handprint to Lydia\u2019s right wrist, then passes the crucible to Derek, who sets it beside Jackson.</p>\n<p>\u201c\u00c1ine, keeper of hearts, protect what is ours and unbind the intruder.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jackson\u2019s hand shakes as he presses a blood-and-ash palm print around Lydia\u2019s left wrist. Peter screams, even through the makeshift gag.</p>\n<p>Stiles meets Derek\u2019s eyes over Lydia\u2019s body and nods before beginning the final chant. \u201cDanu, mother of all, excise this infection and free our sister.\u201d</p>\n<p>As Derek reaches a bloody hand for Lydia\u2019s throat, Peter goes wild, thrashing so hard against the bonds that Stiles is afraid the D-rings might come unscrewed. Then Derek gets his hand around her neck and snarls, \u201cPeter. Get. <em>Out</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>The body on the floor chokes, arches, and exhales a fine red mist. It hovers over Lydia\u2019s body for a moment, but it can\u2019t get back in\u2014not with five protective blood-and-ash barriers. There\u2019s only one place it can go.</p>\n<p>Stiles breaks the pentagram and the red mist, all that remains of Peter Hale\u2019s spirit, flies out the window and down into his corpse.</p>\n<p>Stiles hands Derek a lighter. \u201cYou know what to do.\u201d</p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t stay to watch, though. He has more important things to do, unbuckling a coughing Lydia from her restraints. Jackson, Allison, and Kira pitch in. As soon as she\u2019s free, she\u2019s more or less in Stiles\u2019s lap, hugging him until he can\u2019t breathe. \u201cKnew you could do it,\u201d she whispers as he hugs her back just as fiercely.</p>\n<p>Then, of course, she draws back and slaps him across the face. \u201cThat\u2019s for not figuring it out sooner. I thought I was going to have to exorcise myself!\u201d</p>\n<p>Goddess, it\u2019s good to have her back. \u201cLove you too,\u201d he says thickly, blinking back tears.</p>\n<p>Lydia makes an exasperated noise and hugs him again.</p>\n<p>After that, well. Stiles doesn\u2019t know what it is, but something compels him to go outside and watch until the last of Peter Hale crumbles into ash. Lydia stands beside him, stoic, her fingers still laced with Jackson\u2019s.</p>\n<p>Derek hunches upwind, collar turned up against the chill in the air.</p>\n<p>\u201cThanks for coming,\u201d Stiles says as the moon finally crests above the horizon.</p>\n<p>The breeze caresses his face and then gently dies away.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell. That was anticlimactic. Just how I like my exorcisms.\u201d Deaton steps up next to Stiles and shakes his hand. \u201cThank you for asking me to be a witness. You\u2019ll be in touch if there are any complications.\u201d</p>\n<p>It\u2019s not a question, but Stiles answers anyway. \u201cYou can bet on it.\u201d He nods to Marin, and she meets his eyes, more assessing than disapproving for once, and then turns silently toward the driveway.</p>\n<p>Well, that was terrifying.</p>\n<p>Kira claps Stiles on the shoulder and says, \u201cYou did good.\u201d</p>\n<p>A bemused smile tugs at his lips. \u201cUh, thanks.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna go see if I can convince Scott to leave the kids at his mom\u2019s for the night.\u201d She winks. \u201cSee you tomorrow.\u201d</p>\n<p>He waves.</p>\n<p>And that leaves Stiles with Derek, his sister, his sister\u2019s on-again off-again lover, his sister\u2019s lover\u2019s wife, and the local priest. If only they were walking into a bar, this would be the beginning to a terrible joke.</p>\n<p>After an interminable moment, Jackson exchanges a glance with Allison, then turns to Lydia and says, \u201cDo you want to go somewhere to talk?\u201d</p>\n<p>She straightens, purses her lips, and looks down at her outfit, then the bloody handprints on her wrists. \u201cGive me ten minutes to clean up. I\u2019ll drive.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jackson follows her into the house.</p>\n<p>And then there were four.</p>\n<p>Allison levels a soft, sweet smile at Father Isaac. \u201cLooks like it\u2019s you and me. Do you need a ride?\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles wants to laugh. Father Isaac doesn\u2019t need a ride anywhere, from anyone. His transportation is built-in, even if it is usually covered by the cassock.</p>\n<p>But Father Isaac smiles back. \u201cJust let me get my Bible. I left it upstairs.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles watches him go\u2014it\u2019s an old book, from the 1700s, when Isaac did his training in Rome, so he understands why Isaac would want to make sure he has it\u2014then squints at Allison.</p>\n<p>Who\u2019s blushing.</p>\n<p>Holy <em>shit</em>. \u201cOh for the love of God,\u201d Stiles says. It\u2019s really the only blasphemy appropriate to this situation. \u201cI hope you know what you\u2019re doing.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, the wings can be tricky,\u201d she allows with the hint of a grin. \u201cI break more bedside lamps that way.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cJesus Christ.\u201d Apparently Stiles has another Christian blasphemy prepared for just this situation. \u201cJust don\u2019t get pregnant.\u201d That\u2019s all they need, to incur the literal wrath of a god\u2014any god. \u201cMaybe don\u2019t tell your dad either.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, well, there\u2019s a reason he\u2019s not allowed inside the city limits unless he calls me a week ahead of time.\u201d She shrugs, then takes a step back toward the Porsche. \u201cKeep your pups in line,\u201d she offers as a parting shot just as Isaac descends the stairs.</p>\n<p>Rude. Well, at least she didn\u2019t pull out her bow.</p>\n<p>With a sigh, Stiles turns back to the smoldering pit and reaches for the shovel. This better be the last time he has to bury this asshole.</p>\n<p>Now that Derek knows the truth, Stiles expects him to leave. After all, Stiles betrayed him, and he\u2019s had enough of that in his life. To his surprise, though, Derek doesn\u2019t leave. Instead, he picks up the other shovel and helps Stiles fill in the hole.</p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t say anything. Stiles guesses that in Derek\u2019s shoes, he wouldn\u2019t feel much like chatting either.</p>\n<p>When the hole has been filled in and Stiles is standing in the kitchen, watching the electric kettle and wishing he had the energy left to boil water instantly, he figures, what the hell. It won\u2019t hurt to ask, right? Or at least not as much as it\u2019s going to hurt later.</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you, um. Do you still want to talk?\u201d Stiles licks his lips nervously.</p>\n<p>Derek\u2019s face is a study in expressionlessness. He sits at the kitchen table, his hands folded in front of him, his eyes downcast\u2014until he meets Stiles\u2019s gaze . \u201cI\u2019m willing to listen.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles takes that to mean he has some serious explaining to do, and nods as he reaches for two mugs. \u201cI\u2019ll just\u2026 let me get something.\u201d</p>\n<p>When he returns with his old spellbook, Derek has moved the steaming mugs to the table, along with a saucer and the jar of honey. Stiles settles down next to him on the bench and slides the book onto the table.</p>\n<p>His hands shake. Never before has he faced the prospect of telling someone he loves them and therefore they\u2019re probably going to die.</p>\n<p>\u201cIn my family, we write down all our more complex spells.\u201d Stiles runs his fingers down the cover before flipping it open. \u201cThis is my first spellbook, from when I was nine or ten.\u201d He turns to the appropriate page. \u201cAnd this is the spell that was supposed to keep me from falling in love.\u201d</p>\n<p>His heart is racing in his ears. Derek must hear it, because he tilts his head to look at him before tugging the book in front of himself, like he can\u2019t help it. Like he might be interested in what Stiles has to say, in spite of everything.</p>\n<p>Stiles doesn\u2019t even know whether to hope for that. It\u2019s stupidly selfish, because if Derek stays, he\u2019ll die, and it\u2019s going to hurt. The thought hurts already, after two weeks. But Derek\u2019s alone, so alone, with no family and no pack and nothing to anchor him. Not like they anchored Lydia last night. Maybe he\u2019ll think a few happy years would be worth it.</p>\n<p>Maybe Stiles should just open his mouth and explain already. \u201cMy whole life, I\u2019ve avoided relationships because of the curse. Before you, I\u2019d never even slept with the same person twice. I didn\u2019t want to lead anyone on. But with you I couldn\u2019t help myself. I didn\u2019t want to stop. I liked having you around and the way you get along with my kid and you put your arm around me on the couch and it was <em>good</em>, and the whole time I felt like shit because I wasn\u2019t being honest with you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek still has his face turned down toward the book, and Stiles can\u2019t get a read on him. He thinks he sees his Adam\u2019s apple bob as he swallows. \u201cThis is the spell you cast to make sure you never fell in love.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Stiles says quietly past the lump in his throat. \u201cBut all it did was ensure I\u2019d fall in love with you instead.\u201d</p>\n<p>Inhaling sharply, Derek finally turns to meet Stiles\u2019s gaze. \u201cStiles\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI didn\u2019t do it on purpose!\u201d Stiles blurts. His eyes are burning but he can\u2019t break eye contact. \u201cIf you leave now maybe the curse won\u2019t kill you and\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek stops him with the press of a finger against his lips. His face is serious, his voice steady but low. \u201cI\u2019ve been cursed my whole life and I never gave up.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTell me,\u201d Derek says, pulling his hand away.</p>\n<p>Stiles shudders in capitulation. \u201cI love you,\u201d he says wretchedly, closing his eyes against bitter tears.</p>\n<p>Derek laces their fingers together and squeezes until Stiles looks at him again. \u201cYou never asked how I take my coffee.\u201d</p>\n<p>At first Stiles doesn\u2019t know what to make of that. Magic hits him like that sometimes, with little practical hints about the people around him. Then he remembers that everyone who knows how Derek takes his coffee is dead, and thinks maybe he understands. He swallows and squeezes back.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou asked me in, you fed me, you made me feel\u2014\u201d He huffs and shakes his head, his cheeks stained with red as he clenches his jaw. \u201cYou made me <em>feel</em>.\u201d He shifts closer on the bench. \u201cI\u2019m not going anywhere.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles\u2019s words have deserted him, so he leans his head on Derek\u2019s shoulder and just breathes him in until the panic fades.</p>\n<p>Finally Derek draws back, tugging him to his feet. \u201cCome on,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s been a long night.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles strips mechanically, leaving his clothes in a pile on the floor. When he turns around after digging a pair of pajama bottoms out of the bottom of his dresser, there\u2019s a huge black wolf in his bedroom. Stiles takes an instinctive step back before he can rein in the impulse. \u201cIf this is your way of telling me you don\u2019t want to talk about it, I have to give you props for subtlety.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek whuffs and jumps up on the bed, looking at Stiles expectantly.</p>\n<p>He climbs in, and Derek burrows under the sheets next to him, wriggling closer until he\u2019s essentially using Stiles as a second mattress, or maybe functioning as a second blanket. It\u2019s hard to tell the difference. He settles his massive head just below Stiles\u2019s shoulder, then turns and licks his chest, over his heart.</p>\n<p>Stiles threads the fingers of his left hand through his fur. \u201cOkay, I get it,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m glad.\u201d</p>\n<p>His last thought before he falls asleep is that losing this is going to destroy him.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>In the morning, Stiles is more than a little surprised to see Lydia in the kitchen, doing the crossword over a bowl of cereal and a banana. \u201cHey. Didn\u2019t expect to see you this morning.\u201d He makes a detour to the table to smack a kiss on her hair before resuming his quest for coffee, which just goes to show how much he loves her.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou thought I was going to start sleeping with Jackson again right after being possessed by my creepy psychotic former lover for two weeks?\u201d she asks, all judgment.</p>\n<p>And before coffee, too. Stiles looks into his mug, then at Lydia, and sighs. \u201cI feel like this is a trap.\u201d</p>\n<p>She smiles as if she\u2019s pleased with him. \u201cWe just talked. We have a lot of talking to do before we\u2019re ready for more than that.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles sighs. Dammit, they\u2019re determined to live happily ever after. \u201cYou\u2019re going to make me stop selling him the fart tea, aren\u2019t you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, Stiles, I\u2019m going to make you stop selling him the fart tea. But I promise to let you give him warts when he screws up.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles figures that\u2019s about as fair as he can hope for.</p>\n<p>\u201cI can\u2019t help noticing that Derek\u2019s car is still here,\u201d Lydia continues, apparently in a quest to make up for all the sistering she missed out on over the past two weeks. \u201cI take it he\u2019s sticking around?\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles nods, sitting opposite her at the table.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo why do you look like someone kicked your puppy?\u201d</p>\n<p>Seriously? Stiles stares at her. \u201cYou want me to say it?\u201d</p>\n<p>Lydia pauses midchew, a baffling expression on her face, then swallows and pushes away her bowl. \u201cSay what?\u201d</p>\n<p>Fuck. <em>Fine. </em>\u201cI\u2019m basically <em>killing him</em>, Lydia,\u201d he snarls. \u201cSure, most of the time I can live in the moment, but sometimes? I\u2019m going to be sad.\u201d</p>\n<p>Then\u2014weirdly\u2014Lydia smiles. It\u2019s gentle and a little smug, and it <em>stings</em> that she can smile right now, but\u2014\u201cStiles. Do you really not know you broke the curse?\u201d</p>\n<p>Wait, what?</p>\n<p>She rolls her eyes. \u201cHonestly, you never did pay attention to Mom\u2019s lessons, did you?\u201d She taps the spellbook, which is still on the table from the night before. \u201cTwo spells, both with the same intention. One a curse designed to punish any man of our line who dared to fall in love. The other, a child\u2019s wish to avoid heartbreak.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles licks his lips.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat happens when you multiply two negatives, Stiles?\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles is still staring at her, agape, when Derek stumbles into the kitchen in dirty jeans and one of Stiles\u2019s T-shirts. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d he asks, looking back and forth between Stiles and Lydia. \u201cYour heartbeat just started going crazy.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhen the second spell is completed,\u201d Stiles says aloud. He takes a deep breath and reaches for that darkness around his heart and it isn\u2019t <em>there</em>. Holy shit. \u201cWhen the second spell is completed, the two cancel each other out. The curse breaks.\u201d He barks out a laugh.</p>\n<p>Then he pushes back from the table and throws himself at Derek, who catches him around the thighs, the beginnings of a reckless smile pulling at the corners of his mouth. \u201cWe\u2019re gonna live happily ever after,\u201d Stiles tells him fiercely, and seals the promise with a morning breath kiss.</p>\n<p>(Sunday morning, Stiles wakes when Derek jerks beneath him in apparent surprise. \u201c\u2019S\u2019a matter?\u201d he asks, sleepily rubbing his cheek over Derek\u2019s chest. \u201cRina up?\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek shakes his head. \u201cYour aunts are home.\u201d He sounds mortified, which doesn\u2019t make any sense. \u201cThey want to know when they get to meet their new son-in-law.\u201d</p>\n<p>Never mind. It makes total sense. Stiles buries a laugh against Derek\u2019s skin and then sits up. \u201cCome on. Time to face the music.\u201d</p>\n<p>Six weeks later, at the prompting of the universe, he drops an engagement announcement in the mail, wondering who the hell he knows in Argentina.)</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>"
