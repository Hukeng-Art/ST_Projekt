  "text": "<p>\n<b>Shen Yuan</b>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Shen Yuan\u2019s life wasn\u2019t perfect.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>He doubted that it was possible to have a perfect life, there were always things that were imperfect. Shen Yuan, for example, had an utterly weak and sickly body. When he was younger he was too weak to leave his room, and even now as a young adult he had to be extremely careful about what he ate, where he went, how much he did, and how long he was out in the elements. His mother and father were wealthy, but never especially doting or present. He was an only child, so growing up he didn\u2019t have any friends, and he spent most of his time reading or practicing the instruments his parents wanted him to learn.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Things began to look up for him when he was a teenager. When he was old enough to have his own laptop and phone, he (perhaps foolishly) entered spaces online in which he could talk to other people. It started off innocently enough, digital chatrooms where he had a cute little avatar. He met his best friend on one such website, Shang Qinghua.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Shang Qinghua was annoying, his typing was sometimes illegible, and his habits were atrocious. They stayed friends for years. He made more friends when he was deemed healthy enough to ender public highschool.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>He got good grades, he graduated in high standing in his class, and he got into his college of choice.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Though it was in the summer before he started college where he met the person that would bring his life the closest to perfection that it would ever be: his amazing and wonderful Luo Binghe.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Binghe was incredible. He was almost unreal. He was prettier than any model Shen Yuan had ever seen in his life, he was tall and </span>\n<em>\n<span>built. </span>\n</em>\n<span>It came as no surprise when Binghe told him that he did modeling in order to pay for culinary school. </span>\n<em>\n<span>Culinary school. </span>\n</em>\n<span>Binghe\u2019s cooking was heavenly, the first time Shen Yuan tasted any he wept. Actually wept. Beyond that, he was sweet, kind, and gentle. Even if he was a little clingy at times, Shen Yuan couldn\u2019t bring himself to mind. How could he? This amazing, unreal man had somehow decided that he was in love with weak, nerdy, nitpicky, and spoiled Shen Yuan. It almost didn\u2019t seem real, but any doubts that Shen Yuan would have were quickly put to rest by his Binghe.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>All it would take was a quick glance into his (amazing, beautiful, sparkling, fathomless) eyes, and Shen Yuan could clearly see the love his Binghe had in them. It was there in his eyes, his kisses, his touches, his everything. Shen Yuan would have to be the stupidest man on the planet to doubt Binghe\u2019s feelings for him, and even stupider than that to let this amazing man slip through his fingers.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>For while Binghe was amazing, he had his faults as everyone does. He was easily jealous, he was as sticky as anything, he was </span>\n<em>\n<span>vicious </span>\n</em>\n<span>if insulted, a little overprotective, and his puppy-eyes were far too powerful. Though the </span>\n<em>\n<span>worst </span>\n</em>\n<span>thing, the worst thing?</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Binghe was studying abroad.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Far, far away from Shen Yuan.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>He </span>\n<em>\n<span>hated it. </span>\n</em>\n<span>He hated it, but he could cope. They video call, they send snapchats, they talk on the phone, they text. There\u2019s no distrust, there\u2019s no lack of communication, as far as long distance went, they were doing very well. Shen Yuan just missed having Binghe near him. Always missed having his Binghe nearby.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Though, there was another problem that came along with their long distance relationship.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<span>Nobody believed Binghe was real!!</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Was his credibility so low?! Was it </span>\n<em>\n<span>so </span>\n</em>\n<span>unrealistic that Shen Yuan could have a boyfriend?</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0Why wouldn\u2019t people believe him!? Binghe is real, goddamnit!\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<b>Shen Jiu</b>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The day he met Shen Yuan, Shen Jiu thought he was short, far too thin, his style was totally outdated, his glasses were so big it was ridiculous, and that he was </span>\n<em>\n<span>cute. </span>\n</em>\n<span>Ugh. He was adorable.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The first time that Shen Yuan looked at Shen Jiu, blinking his pale-green eyes up at him through his thick-rimmed glasses, Shen Jiu was overcome with a bizarre urge to wrap him, this complete and utter stranger, into a hug. Then the stranger smiled at him, and Shen Jiu felt a physical </span>\n<em>\n<span>tug. </span>\n</em>\n<span>What the fuck? What the </span>\n<em>\n<span>fuck? </span>\n</em>\n<span>That wasn\u2019t allowed. Shen Jiu panicked, and told Shen Yuan to get out of his seat.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>It wasn't even his seat.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>It was the first day of classes, how would anyone have picked seats yet? Why did he say that? It didn\u2019t end up mattering. Shen Jiu had half-expected him to fold, to get up and apologize profusely like any number of other people he had intimidated. Shen Jiu knew he was scary. He was intimidating on purpose, so that he could get what he wanted without people being putting up too much of a fight. All it would take is a singular glare, and weaker people would bend back and let him do what he wanted.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Shen Yuan </span>\n<em>\n<span>hadn\u2019t.\u00a0</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Shen Yuan had looked up at him, utterly unimpressed. He said, \u201cSorry, I didn\u2019t know this is your seat, but if you want me to move you should </span>\n<em>\n<span>ask nicer.</span>\n</em>\n<span>\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Shen Jiu was stunned. People scurrying away with squeaking apologies, he was used to. People becoming aggressive and challenging him, he was used to.People belittling and insulting him, he was used to. People (one person) coddling him and acquiesced with a smile to his every whim, he was used to. He was not used to somebody telling him to act </span>\n<em>\n<span>nicer.\u00a0</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>It shook him to his core, and he was unable to do anything but revert back onto another fail-safe. He just scoffed and then took the next available seat, right behind Shen Yuan.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Other students slowly began to trickle in, but Shen Jiu couldn\u2019t be bothered to pay attention to any of them. He just kept his gaze fixed on the back of Shen Yuan\u2019s head. The class started, and the professor did the brain-dead nonsense every professor did on the first day of class: stand up, say your name, your major, and give an interesting fact about yourself.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Shen Yuan stood up. \u201cMy name is Shen Yuan.\u201d He said, his voice slightly quiet, but not so much to be classified as \u2018quiet.\u2019 \u201cMy major is media studies, and I was bedridden until I was fourteen years old.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Shen Jiu blinked at him. There were a few sympathetic gasps and murmurs around, and the professor politely (and disinterestedly, what a tool) asked Shen Yuan (</span>\n<em>\n<span>Shen</span>\n</em>\n<span> Yuan, they had the same surname) Shen Yuan explained his illness, and Shen Jiu thought back to the adorable face that had reprimanded him earlier, and was struck again by that </span>\n<em>\n<span>disgusting </span>\n</em>\n<span>desire to coddle the man in front of him.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Shen Yuan sat back down, and Shen Jiu stood up. \u201cShen Jiu.\u201d He said simply, keeping his voice cold and distant. He sat back down. The professor blinked at him. Shen Jiu kept his face impassive, resisting the urge to raise his eyebrows in challenge. That was all he felt like sharing, thank you very much. Move on.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The professor did move on, and the class soon came to an end. Typically, Shen Jiu would stand up and leave the room as soon as possible, but this time something compelled him to linger for a moment. He thought maybe he should.. Try to talk to Shen Yuan. Not apologize, obviously, but. Flirt maybe. Shen Jiu was handsome as hell and honestly he would be doing this shrimp a favor if they were to hook up. Or kiss. Or hold hands. UGH. What the fuck was wrong with him today?</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Shen Jiu decided to stop being stupid, and stood up. He slipped his laptop into his shoulder bag and walked past Shen Yuan, making sure to keep his gait quick and his eyes forward. Don\u2019t acknowledge. He was halted though, when a hand suddenly grabbed his wrist. He whipped around fast, ready to dodge a punch should he need to, and roughly yanked his wrist out of the (weak, too weak) grip that it was in. He was met with Shen Yuan\u2019s wide eyes and raised eyebrows.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cUh, hey.\u201d Shen Yuan said, rubbing at his hand. \u201cSorry, I didn\u2019t want to grab you but I just wanted to say that uh,\u201d he looked down, and bit at his lip. Shen Jiu\u2019s heart fluttered. </span>\n<em>\n<span>He </span>\n</em>\n<span>wanted to bite those lips. Huh. Guess he was crazy now. Whatever.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cGo out with me.\u201d Shen Jiu said, his mouth apparently seventeen steps ahead of his brain. What. Ever. He watched as Shen Yuan\u2019s eyes widened even more, and his mouth formed words but made no sound. His face was now bright red, and it was </span>\n<em>\n<span>so cute. </span>\n</em>\n<span>Shen Jiu must have some sort of concussion.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI-uh-?\u201d Shen Yuan stuttered. Shen Jiu smirked. \u201cI\u2019m uh- I\u2019m flattered, but I, uh,\u00a0 have a boyfriend?\u201d He said, his voice sounding unsure at the last part. Huh, so that was how he was going to play it?\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cSure you do.\u201d Shen Jiu said, raising his eyebrows. Shen Yuan\u2019s brow furrowed.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhat\u2019s up with that response? I do.\u201d Shen Jiu watched as he pulled out his phone and opened it. He tapped around for a moment, before he turned an image of a completely unreasonably handsome man towards Shen Jiu. Really, if he wanted to go for the fake boyfriend angle, he should have chosen some pictures that weren't </span>\n<em>\n<span>obviously </span>\n</em>\n<span>glamour shots of some model.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Fake boyfriend or not, Shen Jiu decided that he hated that stupid pretty face on the phone. This was the kind of person Shen Yuan liked, huh? Well it wasn\u2019t Shen Jiu so it was the wrong choice, and this stranger on the phone was a filthy beast.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cDo you mind if I take a better look?\u201d Shen Jiu asked, holding his palm out flat. Shen Yuan smiled and placed the phone in his hand. Shen Jiu didn\u2019t take a closer look at the mongrel on the screen, instead he tapped his merry way into Shen Yuan\u2019s contacts and quickly memorized his number, as well as entering his own number. He handed it back to Shen Yuan who looked aghast.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhen should I pick you up?\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou-! What?!\u201d Shen Yuan sputtered, his face darkening even more. \u201cYou can\u2019t just-! Do that! Wha-\u201d Shen Jiu placed his hand against Shen Yuan\u2019s mouth, quietly thrilling at the feeling of his lips under his fingertips.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cRelax. We\u2019re in the same class, it won\u2019t hurt you to have a friend.\u201d He gave his most winning smile, and inwardly preened when he saw Shen Yuan shyly avert his eyes. \u201cWhen should I pick you up?\u201d He asked again.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Shen Yuan shook his head slightly. \u201cI won\u2019t go on a date with you. I </span>\n<em>\n<span>have a boyfriend.\u201d </span>\n</em>\n<span>Shen Jiu was about to chime in, say that even if he did (even though he didn\u2019t) it wouldn\u2019t matter, but Shen Yuan continued, \u201cBut I think you need more friends. So I\u2019ll agree to hang out with you.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Shen Jiu blinked. That wasn\u2019t\u2026 what he expected to hear. He felt himself scowl, and was ready to tear into Shen Yuan, how </span>\n<em>\n<span>dare</span>\n</em>\n<span> he imply he needed more friends--</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>then Shen Yuan laughed, bringing his hand up to his mouth. His eyes crinkled and his cheeks </span>\n<em>\n<span>dimpled </span>\n</em>\n<span>and Shen Jiu lost his marbles. All of his anger flew out the window.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAh, haha, sorry!\u201d Shen Yuan apologized. \u201cSorry, that was rude.\u201d His laughter faded, and Shen Jiu had already forgotten what he was mad about. He stared dumbly at the other man (dear god what had the once proud Shen Jiu been reduced to and so </span>\n<em>\n<span>quickly</span>\n</em>\n<span>), as Shen Yuan checked the shiny black watch on his wrist. \u201cOh, man, I\u2019ve got to go. I\u2019ll see you around Shen Jiu-\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cJiu-ge.\u201d Shen Jiu said. Shen Yuan looked slightly surprised, before ducking his head and nodding, his ears stained with a fetching blush.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cJ-Jiu-ge.\u201d Shen Yuan cleared his throat. \u201cYou should go to class too. Don\u2019t try to bully anyone out of their seat.\u201d He said, his voice fast. He then walked briskly away, leaving Shen Jiu staring after him.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Since that day, Shen Jiu had tried every trick in the book to seduce Shen Yuan, fully embracing the fact that he must have gone completely insane. He invited him to fancy restaurants, paying for his meal, enjoying conversations over candlelight. He would dress in his most alluring clothes, clothes that he </span>\n<em>\n<span>knows </span>\n</em>\n<span>drive people wild. He would lean in close to Shen Yuan, whisper innuendos in his ear, and Shen Yuan </span>\n<em>\n<span>didn\u2019t get the hint.\u00a0</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>He never reciprocated, never even indicated that he understood what was happening. The only indication that Shen Yuan had a romantic bone in his body was when he would coo at pictures of his fake boyfriend on his phone.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Shen Jiu could appreciate his\u2026 dedication, to the fake boyfriend farce, but it was also (and he means this with love) kind of pathetic. And dumb. The vastly more handsome, and most importantly, the vastly more </span>\n<em>\n<span>real </span>\n</em>\n<span>Shen Jiu was practically offering himself to Shen Yuan on a silver platter, and the man was too lost in his charade (Shen Jiu had entertained the idea of delusion as well) that he didn\u2019t notice.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>It was enough to drive a man mad. At least Shen Jiu wasn\u2019t alone in his suffering. He found solace in that.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<b>Mu Qingfang</b>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Mu Qingfang is in love with a man with thin wrists, shiny black hair, bright eyes, and an even brighter smile. Mu Qingfang is in love with a man with a </span>\n<em>\n<span>stunning </span>\n</em>\n<span>laugh, the kindest heart, terrible sleeping habits, and more terrible taste in literature. Mu Qingfang is in love with a man who has a fake boyfriend.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Mu Qingfang knows that\u00a0 he\u2019s not the most\u2026 exciting man available. He\u2019s a busy pre-med student with a botany hobby, who has a strict sleeping schedule and a rather rigid code of morals he lives by. He doesn\u2019t drink, he dresses modestly, and he stays away from cigarettes and he could not be found at any party with more than ten people.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>He wasn\u2019t horrible to look at, he would call himself above average if asked, but he certainly wasn\u2019t comparable to the untouchable beauty of Shen Jiu or Liu Qingge, and he certainly wasn\u2019t even within the same </span>\n<em>\n<span>realm </span>\n</em>\n<span>of comparison with the man Shen Yuan gazes at on his phone screen.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>His \u2018boyfriend,\u2019 Luo Binghe.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Now, Qingfang isn\u2019t one to cast doubt on people without good reason. He considers himself a very trusting and open person. He\u2019s studying to be a doctor after all, he has to be open and accepting of things that people tell him. Though it also means that he draws judgement based on observations that he makes. Really, he wanted to believe Shen Yuan\u2026 he really did.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Luo Binghe, from the pictures Shen Yuan had shown him, was a genuine model. A real model. Shen Yuan had no pictures of the two of them, no pictures of Luo Binghe beyond those that are shared publicly, and no evidence of their relationship beyond his words.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Of course, Mu Qingfang should believe him. He should, but he also knew the reason why a person would pretend to be in a relationship. It kept unwanted suitors away, some people used it as a coping mechanism, and some people were genuinely deluded into believing that they were in a relationship. With Shen Yuan, Mu Qingfang suspected it was to keep unwanted suitors away. The man did have quite a few, after all.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>There was the forthright and tenacious Shen Jiu, who shamelessly and blatantly tried to seduce Shen Yuan every chance he had, Liu Qingge, who tried to make up for his lack of skills with words with gifts and showy demonstration, and of course, Mu Qingfang himself. There were others of course, many of whom gave up after the first \u2018I have a boyfriend.\u2019 As most people would.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Mu Qingfang was one such person initially. He had grown close with Shen Yuan, the other man making regular appearances in the on-campus clinic for checkups, and as well as taking care of the frequently injured Liu Qingge, and his accident-prone roommate Shang Qinghua. As such, Mu Qingfang was aware of this \"boyfriend\" before he had asked Shen Yuan on a date, and once he learned Shen Yuan was taken he was content to let the matter be.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>He did so, until it became apparent that Luo Binghe wasn't real. After he realized it, Mu Qingfang figured that if Shen Yuan wasn\u2019t telling him the truth, he must not be close enough to Shen Yuan for him to trust him with that information. He would simply attempt to endear himself to Shen Yuan in the meantime.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>He by no means wanted to manipulate or trick Shen Yuan, he would simply go about his daily routine, nothing special. He would just buy Shen Yuan healthy snacks from time to time, give him shoulder massages, discuss his (terrible) media recommendations, and help him with his homework. Nothing outrageous. Nothing weird. Just normal\u2026 friend things.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>He couldn't lie to himself like that. He was no better than Shen Jiu. He just wanted to be close to the person he loved, and it wasn\u2019t as if he was doing anything\u2026 </span>\n<em>\n<span>wrong. </span>\n</em>\n<span>Shen Yuan was single, even if Shen Yuan didn\u2019t know that Mu Qingfang knew.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Still\u2026 God must have sent Shen Yuan as some sort of test. A beautiful, delightful, aggravating test of Mu Qingfang\u2019s willpower. He was a patient man, but he was a mortal man nonetheless.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI miss Binghe\u2019s cooking\u2026\u201d Shen Yuan muttered, nibbling on a dried pineapple.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Mu Qingfang pressed down too hard on this pencil, causing the lead to snap. He brushed it away, not taking his eyes away from the utterly adorable pouting expression on Shen Yuan\u2019s face.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cDoes\u2026 Luo Binghe cook?\u201dMu Qingfang asked, keeping his voice level. Shen Yuan\u2019s eyes snapped up to meet Mu Qingfang's own, his expression surprised.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI said that out loud?\u201d Shen Yuan asked, a blush slowly blooming on his pale face. Qingfang nodded. Shen Yuan rubbed the back of his neck. \u201cAh, sorry Qingfang-ge. I don\u2019t mean to imply that I don\u2019t enjoy the snacks you brought me.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Mu Qingfang shook his head with an honest smile. \u201cThere\u2019s no need to apologize. I didn\u2019t take any offense.\u201d Shen Yuan smiled and nodded.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIt\u2019s just that Binghe is an </span>\n<em>\n<span>amazing </span>\n</em>\n<span>cook.\u201d Shen Yuan said, his eyes glittering with excitement. \u201cHe can cook </span>\n<em>\n<span>anything, </span>\n</em>\n<span>from anywhere, and when he gets a recipe wrong, the next time he tries he gets it perfect. It\u2019s so fucking good, I\u2019ve never tasted anything like it. Nothing that I\u2019ve had since the last meal he made me has tasted even half as good.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Normally, Qingfang would smile and listen to Shen Yuan\u2019s passionate rants with a deep contentment and affection, but this time he couldn\u2019t help the small furrow that appeared on his brow. Shen Yuan had never really spoken about Luo Binghe to him before. He had figured it was because there was no reason for Shen Yuan to keep up the pretense around him, but </span>\n<em>\n<span>now </span>\n</em>\n<span>Qingfang was wondering if he has miss-stepped somehow. Why would Shen Yuan feel the need to bring up his fake boyfriend now?</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cQingfang-ge?\u201d Mu Qingfang blinked as Shen Yuan waved a hand in front of his face. Shen Yuan laughed as Mu Qingfang snapped back to attention. \u201cWhere\u2019d you go?\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Mu Qingfang grabbed Shen Yuan\u2019s hand in his own before he could pull it away. \u201cHave I made you uncomfortable, A-Yuan?\u201d He asked, wanting to get to the bottom of his worries. Shen Yuan tilted his head as an expression of confusion flitted across his face.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cUh, no?\u201d He answered, blinking his big eyes at him. His glasses slipped down his nose a bit, and Mu Qingfang unconsciously righted them for him, letting go of his hand. \u201cWhy would you think that?\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Qingfang shook his head, a self-deprecating smile slipping onto his face. He had undoubtedly miss-stepped in some way, but if Shen Yuan wasn\u2019t willing to discuss it, he wouldn\u2019t press the issue. \u201cSorry A-Yuan, I think I\u2019m just a little stressed.\u201d He hoped the (absolutely truth, he was stressed all the time, help him god please) lie would be enough to end the line of questioning.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWell then.\u201d Shen Yuan said, pulling himself on top of the table that was in between them. Qingfang\u2019s eyes widened in surprise as Shen Yuan slid himself across the surface of the table (they were in his kitchen, so there was nobody around to see, but still!) and then slipped into the chair next to him. Qingfang fought off the blush that was threatening to spill onto his face as Shen Yuan scooted the chair he dropped into closer to him, close enough that their arms were touching. \u201cWhat\u2019s it this week?\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>It took a second for Mu Qingfang\u2019s brain to reboot. \u201cI-It\u2019s autoimmune diseases.\u201d He said, tapping his eraser against the wall of words in his text. Shen Yuan stuck out his tongue in distaste, and Qingfang found himself having to avert his eyes to avoid staring.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNot fun.\u201d He said simply, distaste coloring his voice. He tapped at the book, and turned a </span>\n<em>\n<span>blinding </span>\n</em>\n<span>smile to Mu Qingfang, who was utterly helpless in the face of it. He couldn\u2019t fight the blush now, and let it come freely. What else could he do, when faced with such a stunning sight. \u201cI think you\u2019re amazing, Qingfang-ge.\u201d He said, and Mu Qingfang choked. Shen Yuan carried on, not noticing. He looked down at the textbook, his smile dimming. \u201cAfter everything I have to deal with because of my condition, I can\u2019t stand reading anything medical for long periods of time. It upsets me, you know? But you\u2019re dedicating your life to </span>\n<em>\n<span>helping </span>\n</em>\n<span>people like me who can\u2019t help themselves.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Qingfang could only nod.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou put up with all this shit, all of these </span>\n<em>\n<span>words, </span>\n</em>\n<span>all of these crazy specific treatments and parts of the body.\u201dHe looked back to Qingfang, and his eyes were moist. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be alive if it weren\u2019t for people like you, Qingfang-ge, so if there\u2019s anything I can do to help you, you have to let me know. Got it?\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Blinking back his own tears, when had that happened, Mu Qingfang nodded again, clearing his throat that had become stopped up. If he was in love before, now he was utterly </span>\n<em>\n<span>fucked. </span>\n</em>\n<span>It was completely unfair for Shen Yuan to do this to him, to express his genuine admiration and offer to help, while looking at him with a smile </span>\n<em>\n<span>like that </span>\n</em>\n<span>and teary eyes. It was enough to drive a man mad. Qingfang was nearly there already, and Shen Yuan was rapidly sending him right towards insanity.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>They studied for an hour or two after that, Qingfang far more invested with Shen Yuan at his side, shamefully eager to impress him with his dedication and knowledge, perhaps showboating his knowledge as much as he could. It wasn\u2019t his fault that whenever he did so, Shen Yuan would say \u2018woah,\u2019 with starry eyes. </span>\n<em>\n<span>For him.\u00a0</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>When they had completed the chapter, Shen Yuan stretched, raising his arms high above his head and stretching his legs out, curling his toes. Mu Qingfang averted his eyes when he noticed the action caused his sweater to rise up slightly, exposing some of his pale stomach.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cA-Yuan,\u201d Mu Qingfang said carefully, his voice wavering ever-so-slightly. \u201cYou know you don\u2019t have to hide anything from me.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Shen Yuan nodded absently, checking his phone.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIf..\u201d He paused, considering his words. \u201cIf you ever\u2026 break up, with Luo Binghe, know that I\u2019ll be here.\u201d He took a deep breath. That was about as obvious as he could make it without making it totally obvious. \u201cEven if you just need somebody to keep others away, I\u2019d be more than happy to help.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>He held his breath as Shen Yuan looked at him. His face went through a journey of emotions. First he seemed surprised, then confused, before settling somewhere between disbelieving and aggravated. Mu Qingfang felt a chill run down his back.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou-\u201d uh oh. \u201cYou don\u2019t think Binghe is real either?!\u201d He yelled, slamming his hands down onto his thighs. Qingfang flinched back, surprised by the response, he also felt a bolt of concern, did Shen Yuan hurt himself? \u201cBinghe\u2019s </span>\n<em>\n<span>real!\u201d </span>\n</em>\n<span>Shen Yuan grabbed his phone, and held it into Mu Qingfang\u2019s face. The lock screen was a selfie of Luo Binghe, unreasonably handsome as he ever was.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOf course he\u2019s real-\u201d He started, but was cut off.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHe\u2019s my </span>\n<em>\n<span>real boyfriend!\u201d </span>\n</em>\n<span>Shen Yuan yelled, his face turning red in anger, and his breathing becoming labored. Right. Time to admit defeat. Qingfang placed his hands on Shen Yuan\u2019s shoulders.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI know, A-Yuan.\u201d He lied, attempting to calm him down so he wouldn\u2019t hurt himself. \u201cI meant what I said and nothing else. I know\u2026 you and Luo Binghe are very in love, and I don\u2019t think anything will happen, but if it does, you have me. Just as I know I have you.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOh.\u201d\u00a0 Shen Yuan still looked skeptical. \u201cOkay. Sorry.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Mu Qingfang didn\u2019t sleep that night. He stayed up researching Erotomania.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<b>Liu Qingge</b>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Shen Yuan was insane, but Liu Qingge wanted to kiss him anyway.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>He wanted to bury his nose in his soft and sweet-smelling hair, he wanted to kiss those small hands and their calloused fingertips, he wanted to hug the warm and small body close to his own, he wanted to kiss those pink lips, he wanted to do push-ups with him on his back to increase his resistance, and he wanted to do\u2026 other things too.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Yeah. Other things. Things that his sister wrote about in those journals of hers. Things that happen in private. Those things. The sex things. Liu Qinnge wanted to do the sex things to Shen Yuan, who was a certified crazy person.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Maybe that made Liu Qingge a crazy person, too. He didn\u2019t really care if he was or not. As long as he could still do martial arts he could be as crazy as he wanted to be. Really, as long as he could still do martial arts he could do anything he wanted.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>He couldn\u2019t do the </span>\n<em>\n<span>person </span>\n</em>\n<span>he wanted, but that was because, as he may have mentioned, Shen Yuan was crazy.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Shen Yuan had a fake boyfriend. Which, okay, there were lots of people with fake boyfriends. There were lots of people whose boyfriends were fake, too. Shen Yuan fell into both of those categories. He carried around pictures of \u201cLuo Binghe,\u201d and talked about him as if he was his actual boyfriend.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Liu Qingge had never actually seen Shen Yuan interact with \u201cLuo Binghe,\u201d however, and Liu Qingge may not know a lot (anything) about relationships, but you were supposed to talk to your boyfriend. You were supposed to ask him about his day, and tell him you love him, and protect him from harm, return the notebooks he leaves behind, and do push-ups with him on your back to increase your resistance.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Liu Qingge figured he would be a good boyfriend.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>If Liu Qingge was Shen Yuan\u2019s boyfriend, he would be able to pull him into a kiss when Shen Yuan waited for him after his tournament, staring at him with admiration and awe, bouncing on his feet in excitement. When Shen Yuan pulled him into a hug to congratulate him on winning, he would be able to hold on tighter and swing him around in a circle, before sweeping him into his arms and kissing him (the kissing was very important).\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Instead, all he could do was accept the hug gratefully (awkwardly), patting man he (really really) wanted to kiss on the back in thanks.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThat was incredible!\u201d Shen Yuan excitedly recalled when he pulled back from the embrace. \u201cYou laid everyone out </span>\n<em>\n<span>flat </span>\n</em>\n<span>so fast!\u201d Shen Yuan slapped Liu Qinnge\u2019s chest, and Liu Qingge was suddenly aware of how sweaty he was. He was sweating even more now, his skin felt like it was on fire where Shen Yuan touched it. \u201cI would ask you to teach me but there\u2019s no fucking way I could even train with you for thirty minutes without needing to be rushed to the hospital.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou can watch me practice.\u201d Liu Qingge said, not eager to let the opportunity to spend more time with Shen Yuan slip through his fingers. \u201cThat way you\u2019ll at least know some basics about protecting yourself.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Shen Yuan rubbed his chin. \u201cI might as well. It would be nice to know something for emergencies.\u201d His face suddenly broke out into a smile. \u201cThough I also bet Binghe wouldn\u2019t even let me get into a place where I need to do so.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Great, so now Shen Yuan\u2019s craziness was going to get him killed. \u201cLuo Binghe isn\u2019t here.\u201d Liu Qingge pointed out. He wasn\u2019t here, and he would never be here. \u201cYou have to protect yourself.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Shen Yuan crossed his arms. \u201cYeah, he\u2019s not here </span>\n<em>\n<span>now-\u201d</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou have to protect yourself.\u201d Liu Qingge reiterated, speaking slower. Shen Yuan glared at him, and Liu Qinnge shuddered. It was kind of hot. That wasn\u2019t important right now. \u201cI can teach you self defense. Just the basics.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Shen Yuan looked thoughtful, pushing his glasses up on his nose. \u201cWell, I guess it couldn\u2019t hurt\u2026 Wait. No, it could actually\u2026\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI\u2019ll protect you then.\u201d Qingge said, feeling his face heat up. As soon as he realized what he had said, he turned his head to the side, hoping to hide some of his blush. \u201cJust because you can\u2019t do it yourself.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>There was no response for a second, before suddenly an (unsubstantial) weight slammed into his body. It caught him completely unprepared, and Liu Qingge let out an undignified yelp as he fell backwards onto the grassy ground outside the dojo. The wind rushed from his lungs, and it took him a moment to come back into his body. There was a weight on his stomach. His vision stopped swimming, and he stared, shocked at Shen Yuan\u2019s smug face.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u2026\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Shen Yuan was straddling Liu Qingge\u2019s torso, just above his hips, with his arms crossed and an utterly self-satisfied expression on his face. Liu Qingge dug his fingers into the palms of his hands to stop his body from responding to the </span>\n<em>\n<span>very </span>\n</em>\n<span>potent stimulus it was currently receiving.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHaha, who cant protect themselves now, huh, Liu-</span>\n<em>\n<span>shidi?\u201d </span>\n</em>\n<span>Shen Yuan mocked, his voice faux-hauty, but overhauling amused.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201c</span>\n<em>\n<span>Shidi?!\u201d </span>\n</em>\n<span>Liu Qingge sputtered. What was with that antiquated form of address?! Why did it make even more heat pool in his abdomen? </span>\n<em>\n<span>What is happening?!\u00a0</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWell, you couldn\u2019t defend yourself against me, and I\u2019m your senior, so\u2026\u201d Shen Yuan said, shrugging his shoulders.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThat is </span>\n<em>\n<span>so </span>\n</em>\n<span>not how that works.\u201d Liu Qingge pointed out, his pride still bruised. He had just won a goddamn tournament, a sneaky sneak attack while his guard was down did </span>\n<em>\n<span>not </span>\n</em>\n<span>count.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cSeems like it from here.\u201d Shen Yuan smiled and poked Liu Qinnge\u2019s face, right where he knew his beauty mark was. The poke turned into a soft pat. \u201cI\u2019m just kidding Qingge. You know that I\u2019d never be able to touch you if you were serious. Let me have you just this once.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<span>Let me have you just this once.\u00a0</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOkay.\u201d Liu Qingge said without thinking. Shen Yuan laughed, throwing his head back, exposing his throat. Liu Qinnge wanted to taste it, and </span>\n<em>\n<span>holy shit</span>\n</em>\n<span> he needed to calm down.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNo need to indulge me, Qingge. I can see how mad you are.\u201d Shen Yuan placed his hands on Liu Qingge\u2019s chest, and Liu Qingge inhaled sharply.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>At that moment, a couple walked out of the dojo. They noticed Liu Qingge and Shen Yuan on the ground, and they gasped. They then sped up theri steps, averting their eyes.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOh, haha, I should get up before people get the wrong idea.\u201d Shen Yuan laughed awkwardly. Liu Qingge was confused. Sure, he was pinned, and Shen Yuan was close to him, but was there anything compromising about this position?\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhy would they get the wrong idea?\u201d Liu Qingge asked, bringing his hands to Shen Yuan\u2019s hips. Shen Yuan blushed brighter and waved his hand.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou know-- this position can be kind of-- yeah.\u201d Liu Qingge still didn\u2019t understand. </span>\n<span><br>\n</span>\n<span>\u201cI still don\u2019t get it.\u201d He informed. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with this position?\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou don't..?\u201d Shen Yuan trailed off. Liu Qingge waited expectantly. Shen Yuan groaned. \u201cOh my god we are </span>\n<em>\n<span>so </span>\n</em>\n<span>not having this conversation.\u201d Shen Yuan pushed off of Liu Qingge, standing up and brushing the (non-present) dirt from his clothes. Liu Qingge followed suit. \u201cBinghe would cry tears of blood if he saw that..\u201d Shen Yuan murmured.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNo he wouldn\u2019t.\u201d Liu Qingge argued. Fake people can\u2019t cry.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI mean he would be upset and really jealous.\u201d Shen Yuan clarified, pulling his phone from his pocket.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNo he wouldn\u2019t.\u201d Liu Qingge said again. Fake people don\u2019t have feelings.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Shen Yuan looked at him like he was crazy, which was ironic. Shen Yuan was the crazy person here. They looked at each other in silence for a few more moments, before there was a distant call.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cCucumber-bro!\u201d Shen Yuan turned around and Liu Qingge looked above his head to see Shen Yuan\u2019s roomate, Shang Qinghua approaching waving his arm.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHey Airplane.\u201d Shen Yuan greeted, giving his friend a \u2018secret handshake\u2019 when Shang Qinghua was close enough to do so. \u201cDid your thing end early?\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201c\u2018Thing\u2019 he says.\u201d Shang Qinghua sniffed. \u201cIt was a </span>\n<em>\n<span>poetry reading </span>\n</em>\n<span>and yes, it did end early.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWho won?\u201d Shen Yuan asked.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNobody wins a poetry reading, bro.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Shen Yuan pointed to Liu Qingge. \u201cQingge won.\u201d Liu Qingge puffed up slightly at the acknowledgement.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAh!\u201d Shang Qinghua flashed a wide grin and a thumbs-up. \u201cWay to go, man!\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThank you.\u201d Liu Qingge replied. Shang Qinghua wasn\u2019t somebody whose opinion he cared about, and he was here to take Shen Yuan home. Liu Qingge felt like he was allowed to be a little short. It wasn\u2019t out of the ordinary anyway.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAha, well, Cucumber-bro we should head back. It\u2019s getting dark.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Shen Yuan nodded. \u201cYeah.\u201d He turned to Liu Qingge, giving him a smile, that in the low light, still managed to stop Liu Qingge\u2019s heart. \u201cCongratulations again, Qingge!\u201d He said with a wave as he walked away. Liu Qingge waved back, before turning on is heel and walking home, determined to do some research to find out why Shen Yuan was so skittish about being seen in that position. Maybe it was because he was crazy.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Liu Qingge figured it out, and no, it wasn\u2019t because he was crazy. He went to sleep that night with a mind full of what he had seen on the internet, and the phantom feeling of Shen Yuan on top of him.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>He woke up with a sore wrist.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<b>Luo Binghe</b>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Luo Binghe was excited.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Luo Binghe was </span>\n<em>\n<span>so excited.\u00a0</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>His spring break had come around, and he had saved up enough money to fly to surprise his boyfriend.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>His amazing, perfect, adorable, radiant, smart, cute, perfect, amazing, </span>\n<em>\n<span>everything </span>\n</em>\n<span>boyfriend, Shen Yuan. Light of his life, his reason for waking up in the morning ang giving every day his all.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Before he had met Shen Yuan, he was driven by spite and a desperate desire to prove himself. He wanted to prove to the world that it was </span>\n<em>\n<span>wrong </span>\n</em>\n<span>to try to destroy Luo Binghe, that he could trample over the worthless people who had pushed him around, belittled and bullied him. He was an infatuated husk of a man.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Then he met Shen Yuan, this sickly little angel who had entered Binghe\u2019s life in a blaze of glory and had burned as brilliantly ever since.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Binghe remembers it like it was yesterday. Two men, Binghe didn\u2019t remember their faces, only that they were older than he was, were attempting to intimidate him, pushing their disgusting selves into his personal space, puffing their chests out like pathetic peacocks. They did the typical asshole-male posturing, \u2018You don\u2019t know who you\u2019re messing with,\u2019 \u2018You better apologize,\u2019 base nonsense Binghe had heard a million times. He had been fully ready to step in, when a small, smaller than the men and certainly smaller than Binghe, man stepped in between them.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Shen Yuan had yelled at the men, telling them to leave Binghe alone, they didn\u2019t have any right to do this to him, he hadn\u2019t done anything wrong. Shen Yuan said that he had the police ready to call with the push of a button, and if they didn\u2019t step off he would call them, don\u2019t test him.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The men had left.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Shen Yuan had turned around, and Binghe was utterly awed by the man. Small, thin, clearly unhealthy. Eyes that could rival the lushest forest, hair shiny and dark as the finest obsidian, with the face of a fairy, and the courage of a lion. This miraculous creature (so delicate and frail) had put himself in danger, and told the danger to </span>\n<em>\n<span>leave Binghe alone, he didn\u2019t deserve it.\u00a0</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>It was everything he had never heard. It was everything he had ever needed to hear.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Luo Binghe fell in love then and there. That day, his luck seemed to completely reverse, now being shone down on favorably by lady luck. How else would he be fortunate enough for Shen Yuan to return his affections?\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>He could hold his love (his savior, his light, his life) in his arms, he could shower him with kisses, he could feed him food that made him giggle in happiness, he could whisper sweet nothings into his ear, he could touch him in ways that would make him </span>\n<em>\n<span>sing. </span>\n</em>\n<span>He could love him, and be loved in return. His A-Yuan was truly the best thing to ever happen to him, and he knows that his darling feels the same way. He told him so!\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>So, suffice to say, Luo Binghe was very excited to see his boyfriend. If he could figure out where he was.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>He looked around the unfamiliar campus, scanning the sea of unfamiliar faces, looking for A-Yuan. Maybe he should ask somebody?\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOh my </span>\n<em>\n<span>fucking god. </span>\n</em>\n<span>There\u2019s no fucking way.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Luo Binghe turned, seeing a man with sharp features and hair pulled into a bun staring disbelievingly at him. Binghe offered a smile out of courtesy, though he couldn\u2019t deny that he was confused by the man\u2019s words. \u201cCan I help you?\u201d He asked, when the man just continued to stare.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI can\u2019t fucking belive this.\u201d The man said, his voice getting more aggravated the more he spoke. Binghe was more concerned now. He wasn\u2019t doing anything wrong, was he? Was this man just\u2026 kind of a huge ass? \u201cCome with me.\u201d The man demanded, snapping his fingers.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Ah. So the man </span>\n<em>\n<span>was </span>\n</em>\n<span>an asshole. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t think I will.\u201d Binghe said, turning away from the unpleasant man. He was scanning the crowd again.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cListen, beast.\u201d The man snapped, and Binghe\u2019s attention whipped back to him. The man had an unpleasant sneer. Binghe wasn\u2019t about to cause problems on A-Yuan\u2019s campus, but this man was </span>\n<em>\n<span>really </span>\n</em>\n<span>testing his patience. \u201cIs your name Luo Binghe?\u201d He asked.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>That was surprising. How did he know who he was? \u201cYes.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The man rubbed at his temples, muttering curses under his breath. The man took a deep breath. \u201cAre you looking for Shen Yuan?\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Binghe perked up, all thoughts of anger flying from his head, replaced by excitement. \u201cYou know A-Yuan? A-Yuan talks about me?\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cGod. Yes, he does. Follow me.\u201d The man snapped his fingers twice, and this time Binghe had no qualms about following him this time, if A-Yuan was where he was headed. They walked, the man still muttering curses and incomprehensible sentences agrilly under his breath as he went. Binghe walked with a spring in his step, and was eventually led to a table that had two unfamiliar men sitting at it. One with short brown hair and glasses, and one with a high black ponytail. More strangers.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cLuo. Fucking. Binghe.\u201d His guide introduced, before throwing himself into one of the empty chairs, crossing his arms childishly. The two men started at him, matching expressions of shock on their faces.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<span>\u201cWhat.\u201d </span>\n</em>\n<span>Ponytail said, his voice sharp. The other didn\u2019t say anything, just looked.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Binghe was uncomfortable. He cleared his throat. \u201cPleased to meet you.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Nobody responded. This was unpleasant. Where was A-Yuan? He was about to open his mouth and ask, when his favorite sound cut through the ambient noise of the crowd.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cBinghe?!\u201d Luo Binghe quickly turned toward the voice, his </span>\n<em>\n<span>A-Yuan\u2019s voice, </span>\n</em>\n<span>and felt a massive beaming grin split his face when he saw him. He was dressed plainly, light jeans and green sneakers, and wrapped up in Binghe\u2019s own sweater.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cA-Yuan!\u201d He yelled, uncaring of the attention it got from strangers. Binghe ran forward, delighted to see that Shen Yuan had started to do the same. Binghe was faster, and as soon as he could, he swept his love up into his arms, rejoicing in the feeling of having him where he </span>\n<em>\n<span>belonged </span>\n</em>\n<span>again</span>\n<em>\n<span>. </span>\n</em>\n<span>He laughed, overcome with joy as he lifted A-Yuan off of his feet, spinning him in a circle. \u201cA-Yuan, A-Yuan!\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cBinghe-!! You-!!\u201d Binghe stopped spinning, and set Shen Yuan down, still keeping his arms tight around his waist. Shen Yuan\u2019s smile was radiant as he looked up at Binghe, his eyes bright with happiness and surprise. Binghe didn\u2019t hold back anymore, and brought his hands up to A-Yuan\u2019s face, before pulling him into a long-awaited kiss.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Shen Yuan made a sound of surprise, one that Binghe swallowed eagerly as he deepened the kiss, rejoicing as Shen Yuan responded enthusiastically, his hands clutching onto Binghe\u2019s shirt. They kissed for a while longer, Binghe playfully nipping at Shen Yuan\u2019s lips, licking into his mouth, before they both pulled away.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Shen Yuan\u2019s face, flushed, eyes blown wide, panting breaths leaving his kissed-red lips, was a sight beyond words. Binghe brought his hands up to his cheeks. \u201cSurprise.\u201d He said, smile coloring his breathless voice. \u201cIs A-Yuan happy to see me?\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Shen Yuan buried his face into Binghe\u2019s chest, wrapping his arms tightly around him. Binghe\u2019s heart was </span>\n<em>\n<span>so </span>\n</em>\n<span>full.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOf course I did\u2026\u201d Shen Yuan admitted, his voice muffled.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Surely, nobody could blame Binghe for kissing his boyfriend again after that.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p><br>\n<br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI\u2019m going to fucking kill him.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cDo </span>\n<em>\n<span>not </span>\n</em>\n<span>joke about that.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNo, he\u2019s right for once.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHe is </span>\n<em>\n<span>not.</span>\n</em>\n<span>\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>"
