  "text": "<p>\u201cnope,\u201d yoongi says, squeezing the phone between his ear and shoulder as he balances on top of a wobbly chair and wipes at the fingerprints high up on his kitchen window. \u201ci\u2019m not coming.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cwhy does it sound like seokjin\u2019s laughing?\u201d taehyung asks. yoongi stops his vigorous wiping. there\u2019s a short silence. \u201care you cleaning the entire apartment again because you\u2019re stressed and procrastinating your assignments?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cno,\u201d yoongi says, and sways a little bit on the unsteady chair. \u201ci\u2019m spring cleaning.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cit\u2019s september, hyung.\u201d taehyung sighs a little bit. \u201csee, you <em> have </em>to come out tonight.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201calready did that at the age of sixteen,\u201d yoongi deadpans, and stares at the numerous new fingerprints he just left on the window.</p>\n<p>\u201cnot the coming out i meant, but i\u2019m very proud of you and i know it wasn\u2019t easy for you and i\u2019m glad you\u2019re in a safer environment now. how come you\u2019re always cleaning, but whenever i come over the place is a mess?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cbecause i can\u2019t fucking clean.\u201d yoongi tosses the wipe somewhere in the sink, not even bothering with the new stains on the glass, and gets off the shaky chair. \u201cyeah, fine, i\u2019m stressed. but coming to a party for dance people where i barely know anyone is not going to make me <em> less </em>stressed.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cyou know me and jimin and hoseok,\u201d taehyung says, defensive, \u201cit\u2019s not just for dance people. <em> i\u2019m </em>not a dance person. there will be other people you know.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cpass,\u201d yoongi says, switching the phone to his right ear as he walks into his cramped living room.</p>\n<p>\u201calso,\u201d taehyung says, sounding like an over-zealous salesman at this point, \u201cme and jimin\u2019s new roommate will be there! you have to meet him. that\u2019s a reason to come if any.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cthat means nothing to me. you <em> live </em>with him. i\u2019m going to meet him sooner or later, anyway.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cyeah, sooner,\u201d taehyung says, \u201cbecause you\u2019re coming to the party. seriously, yoongi. i just want what\u2019s best for you. hang out with us. get drunk. i\u2019ll even wingman for you. when\u2019s the last time you got laid?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cnow it\u2019s a hard pass,\u201d yoongi says, scrunching up his nose. taehyung sighs heartily. there\u2019s some background noise, like wind, and someone talking, but it\u2019s hard to make anything of it. doesn\u2019t sound like jimin, though. yoongi wonders distantly if it\u2019s the new roommate. he\u2019s about to ask what his name is, when taehyung speaks again.</p>\n<p>\u201ci\u2019ve got to go,\u201d he says, \u201csee you at the party. please come!\u201d</p>\n<p>with that, the line goes dead.</p>\n<p>\u201cugh,\u201d yoongi says to no one. honestly, he doesn\u2019t mind going out and meeting friends, it\u2019s just that it\u2019s going to be mostly dance majors and yoongi doesn\u2019t know any dance majors besides hoseok and jimin. and jimin and taehyung are going to stick together the whole night and forget about the rest of the world as soon as someone plays <em> their song, </em>a title that seems to apply to most songs ever made.</p>\n<p>hoseok is going to be talking to and dancing with at least five different groups of people, he\u2019ll somehow end up leaving with a sixth totally random group, and then text the group chat the next morning asking if anyone knows how to get to gangnam from some absurd small town somewhere in southern south korea and if he had his pants on when he left the club.</p>\n<p>so, yoongi\u2019s not exactly thrilled. it\u2019s going to be him, at some point of the evening, drinking alone, surrounded by strangers who all dance better than him. he flops back down on the sofa he left half an hour ago to clean all his windows and half an hour before that to scrub at the stain on the bathroom floor that hasn\u2019t come out for two years. he just felt like it might, today. it didn\u2019t.</p>\n<p>he looks at the handwritten notes scattered across the table and the balled up pieces of paper on the floor and his laptop with three unfinished versions of the same track open in tabs.</p>\n<p>\u201cugh,\u201d he says again, with a different feeling, now.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>/</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><b>yoongi</b> [5:21]<br> fine i\u2019ll come</p>\n<p><b>tae</b> [5:22]<br> YEESSSSSSSSSSSS<br> i knew id sway u<br> i should be a telemarketer<br> or a politician</p>\n<p><b>yoongi</b> [5:23]<br> it wasnt so much you as it was the utter feeling of defeat and complete lack of inspiration and motivation</p>\n<p><b>tae</b> [5:24]<br> damn<br> im sure u will feel inspired after tonight<br> its going to be fun i promise</p>\n<p><b>yoongi</b> [5:24]<br> hmh</p>\n<p><b>tae</b> [5:25]<br> dress hot ;)<br> theres goin to be lots of hot dancer ppl<br> and i cant wingman for u if u look like u died 5 days ago</p>\n<p><b>yoongi</b> [5:26]<br> im always hot</p>\n<p><b>tae</b> [5:26]<br> :/</p>\n<p><b>yoongi</b> [5:27]<br> fuck you</p>\n<p><b>tae</b> [5:27]<br> u know what ive thought abt this and i think u and i could def boink once<br> just once tho and only if u dont find anyone tonight</p>\n<p><b>yoongi</b> [5:28]<br> oh my god<br> ill be there at 8 just stop talking to me</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>/</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>the party is held at a club downtown, a popular place for college parties and student gatherings because the shots are cheap. yoongi feels like he had his share of parties in his first and second year. he\u2019s in his last year, now, and watching drunk freshmen do dumb shit has gotten old. or maybe he\u2019s the one who\u2019s gotten too old to party.</p>\n<p>the last time he went out he ended up just sitting on the sidewalk in front of the club for the entire latter half of the night, comforting a random crying freshman who\u2019d just caught her boyfriend cheating on her. yoongi might\u2019ve given her the entire passionate <em> men are trash </em>speech. then he might\u2019ve taken out his pocketknife and meticulously taken apart the boyfriend\u2019s bike when she\u2019d singled it out from the row of bikes at the bicycle stand, leaving all the parts there, just. disassembled. taehyung would probably call that chaotic good.</p>\n<p>he arrives at ten past eight, hands his id to the bouncer who barely glances at it before gesturing him in. yoongi hovers.</p>\n<p>\u201cyou barely looked at it,\u201d he says, \u201ccan you at least pretend you need more time to ascertain it\u2019s me in the photo?\u201d</p>\n<p>the bouncer stares at him with a stony face.</p>\n<p>\u201cit\u2019s you,\u201d he says.</p>\n<p>\u201cthis photo was taken almost six years ago,\u201d yoongi insists, \u201ccome on, haven\u2019t i changed at least a little bit? my hair\u2019s different.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cface is the same,\u201d the bouncer grunts.</p>\n<p>that\u2019s extremely demoralizing. yoongi just sighs and grudgingly takes his id back, gives the bouncer one last look that says <em> fight me behind the dumpsters </em> while his size and nonexistent fighting experience say <em> please snap me like a twig. </em></p>\n<p>he saunters in, and immediately doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s doing here. one side of the club is playing a mellow pop song, the other one is blasting edm, and the beats mix in the middle chaotically, creating a potential headache. the place is not packed yet, but it\u2019s still a lot of people and yoongi knows none of them. it\u2019s giving his anxiety anxiety.</p>\n<p>he can\u2019t see his friends anywhere, so he makes the only sensible decision he can make in this situation: get drinking. he sits at the bar and sips at a whiskey cola, letting his eyes skim aimlessly over the people on the dance floor. you can tell they are mostly dancers, he supposes.</p>\n<p>someone\u2019s shouting his name over the music. yoongi\u2019s about to turn, but can\u2019t, because suddenly there are three bodies draped across his back.</p>\n<p>\u201che came,\u201d jimin\u2019s saying, like yoongi isn\u2019t right there, \u201ci can\u2019t believe it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cyou\u2019re late,\u201d taehyung remarks, \u201cwere you picking a fight with the bouncer again?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201ci do <em> not </em>look the exact same as i did when i was eighteen,\u201d yoongi says, a bit choked because they\u2019re pressing his chest to the bar counter, \u201cthey could at least humor me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cyou\u2019ve got a babyface,\u201d hoseok laughs, and tries to fucking pinch his cheek like he\u2019s looking to lose a hand, \u201cnothing wrong with that. embrace it.\u201d</p>\n<p>after he\u2019s bitten hoseok\u2019s finger and they\u2019ve gotten off of him, he looks around over his shoulder, but they don\u2019t have anyone with them.</p>\n<p>\u201cyour roommate is not here?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201che\u2019s going to be here,\u201d taehyung waves a hand, and takes the stool on yoongi\u2019s left, \u201che got held up by something or other. he\u2019s pretty busy already at this point of the semester, he takes a million classes and somehow juggles a job at the flower shop close to campus, too. but i\u2019m sure you\u2019re going to like him. he\u2019s great. he has a great sense of humor and he's super nice.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201chigh praise,\u201d yoongi comments.</p>\n<p>\"and he likes all the video games i like,\u201d taehyung goes on, \u201cthe other night, we stayed up until six playing overwatch. he\u2019s lived with us only for a few days, but i know he\u2019s the one.\u201d</p>\n<p>\"the one?\u201d yoongi quirks an eyebrow. when taehyung talks about people, it can be really hard to deduce whether he\u2019s actually in love with them, or if he\u2019s just excited about a new friend.</p>\n<p>\u201cthe roommate of destiny, the one that will complete our household,\u201d taehyung says, a hand over his heart. \u201cthe geckos like him.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cah, the gecko test,\u201d yoongi says, amused. \u201cwell. he sounds nice.\u201d</p>\n<p>hoseok starts ordering shots, and yoongi doesn\u2019t remember until later that he still doesn\u2019t know the roommate\u2019s name. the topic changes, unfortunately to yoongi\u2019s sex life.</p>\n<p>\u201chmm, you look hot, that\u2019s good,\u201d taehyung evaluates with his chin in the v of his index finger and thumb, looking yoongi up and down. \u201care those the jeans that make your ass look nice?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cthey are,\u201d hoseok confirms from yoongi\u2019s other side. when in doubt, or when making a last minute decision to attend a party full of hot dancer people, dress all black, yoongi concluded. he\u2019s wearing a leather jacket over a t-shirt tucked into his ripped jeans, silver on his ears and around his neck. he looks alright. so maybe the jeans were intentional. sue him. he throws back the soju shot that hoseok pushes in front of him.</p>\n<p>\u201ccan you stop talking about my ass? it\u2019s a nice ass. best ass in our friend group, no need to discuss.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cthat\u2019s just not true,\u201d jimin says, perking up from where he was slouching against taehyung\u2019s shoulder.</p>\n<p>\u201cass-off, ass-off,\u201d hoseok chants.</p>\n<p>\u201cthis was supposed to be about getting yoongi laid,\u201d taehyung complains.</p>\n<p>\u201cno it wasn\u2019t,\u201d yoongi glares, \u201cit has never <em> been </em>about that. it\u2019s about distracting myself from the fact that i\u2019m stuck with my project before i break my entire apartment cleaning.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cwhat\u2019s a better distraction than a nice boink?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201ci agree with tae,\u201d hoseok says, \u201cyou could let out a little steam.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cluckily, your wingman\u2019s here.\u201d taehyung drapes an arm over his shoulders, and yoongi resists the urge to roll his eyes. \u201cjust pick whoever you want here, and i\u2019ll make it happen.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cexcept for me, i\u2019m off-limits,\u201d jimin says.</p>\n<p>\u201ci\u2019m not,\u201d hoseok says, waggling his eyebrows.</p>\n<p>\u201cnever again, hobi,\u201d yoongi says dryly, and hoseok just laughs, downs the rest of his drink.</p>\n<p>\"i just want to help,\u201d taehyung says, \u201chonestly. so if anyone catches your eye\u2026 tell me, and i\u2019ll wingman the shit out of it.\u201d</p>\n<p>yoongi sighs.</p>\n<p>\u201cthanks for the uncomfortable level of involvement, guys, but i can pick people up by myself if i want,\u201d he says in a tone that he hopes radiates conclusion, \u201cso please don\u2019t try to help me. i\u2019m serious. please. don\u2019t help.\u201d</p>\n<p>thankfully, they seem to accept it. mostly.</p>\n<p>they sit around a table with their drinks, and people hoseok and jimin and sometimes taehyung know stop by from time to time to chat. yoongi makes small talk, and when he gives a laugh at something a guy whose name he didn\u2019t catch says, he can see taehyung shift in his peripheral, eyes sharply and intensely fixed on yoongi. when yoongi looks, he raises his eyebrow, subtly tilts his head towards the guy. he\u2019s leaning forward like he\u2019s ready to pounce on them and hook them up at the first sign of interest from yoongi. it\u2019s a bit disconcerting, to be honest.</p>\n<p>yoongi raises his glass to his lips, gives his head a small shake.</p>\n<p>he already thought about it before coming here, about maybe taking someone home or going home with someone. he does need distraction. needs to unwind a little and clear his mind from the track he\u2019s been stuck with for half a century.</p>\n<p>and sure, there are some hot guys here, and although it\u2019s not exactly a gay club, these college parties make it a point to be all-inclusive and lgbt-friendly, and yoongi\u2019s already been hit on by a couple of guys - apparently he emits some sort of a gay aura - but no one\u2019s\u2026 catching his eye, like taehyung said. lots of hands have been shoved at yoongi to shake, hot dancer arms, but he\u2019s feeling it less and less.</p>\n<p>if he\u2019s not going home with anyone tonight, he\u2019s just going to drink and join hoseok\u2019s personal cheering squad made up of jimin and taehyung, when hoseok gets dragged away to the edm side of the club for a dance battle. he watches hoseok wipe the floor with some guys, and feels so proud he almost sheds a tear. it doesn\u2019t matter that he doesn\u2019t know a lot of dance majors because he knows the best ones. he tells this to jimin, cranes his neck to shout it into his ear, and jimin grins with the power of a thousand suns.</p>\n<p>\u201ci love it when you\u2019re drunk,\u201d he shouts over the music, \u201cyou just say all the fond shit you\u2019re thinking.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201ci\u2019m always saying fond shit,\u201d yoongi says, feeling the odd need to get defensive, and then one kim taehyung latches onto his side, squeezing the air out of him.</p>\n<p>\u201cnone of the guys here deserve you, yoongi,\u201d he half-slurs into his jacket. \u201cyou deserve the best, only the nicest, hottest, meatiest - prime beef - fuck, i\u2019m so hungry -\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201ci\u2019m sure they sell snacks here,\u201d yoongi says, patting at taehyung\u2019s arm, and gesturing at jimin to gather his roommate because he\u2019s pretty sure taehyung\u2019s crying.</p>\n<p>taehyung sniffles about wanting to eat steak until he suddenly perks up five seconds later, starts bouncing up and down and taking jimin with him, yelling about the song that came on, steak completely forgotten, and it\u2019s exactly how taehyung is drunk. it\u2019s a rollercoaster, one-eighty after another.</p>\n<p>and although it hasn\u2019t been a bad time, they arrive at that point in the evening where it starts going just like yoongi had predicted. he last saw jimin and taehyung reenacting moves from dirty dancing on the dance floor, and he\u2019s not sure hoseok\u2019s even on the venue anymore. he has a feeling he\u2019d make himself seen and definitely heard if he was here.</p>\n<p>he navigates to the bathroom to splash some water on his face and strip off his leather jacket because he\u2019s fucking hot. he gives himself a once-over in the mirror, drags a hand through the dark brown hair that\u2019s doing some mysterious, unfathomable wavy thing today. he feels buzzed as opposed to piss drunk, which is a damn shame. he digs his phone out, texts namjoon.</p>\n<p><b>yoongi</b> [10:49]<br> you guys coming to this party thing for dance ppl?</p>\n<p><b>namjoon</b> [10:50]<br> nah seokjins got the cold</p>\n<p><b>yoongi</b> [10:50]<br> what r u his mom</p>\n<p><b>namjoon</b> [10:50]<br> no, his boyfriend<br> we\u2019re just cuddling watching ghibli films</p>\n<p><b>yoongi</b> [10:51]<br> gross</p>\n<p><b>namjoon</b> [10:51]<br> whatever you say<br> hows the party</p>\n<p><b>yoongi</b> [10:52]<br> ok<br> everyone ditched me might leave soon</p>\n<p><b>namjoon</b> [10:52]<br> do you need a ride</p>\n<p><b>yoongi</b> [10:53]<br> whats it to you you dont even have a license</p>\n<p><b>namjoon </b>[10:53]<br> walk then asshole</p>\n<p><b>yoongi </b>[10:54]<br> have fun cuddling with ur boyfriend and being in love like a fuckin loser</p>\n<p><b>namjoon</b> [10:54]<br> thanks i will<br> be safe</p>\n<p>yoongi sighs a little. now he\u2019s having unwanted thoughts about having someone to cuddle and watch ghibli films with. he certainly won\u2019t find <em> that </em>here tonight. he pockets his phone, gives himself one last look before leaving the bathroom, jacket draped over his arm.</p>\n<p>he\u2019s going to get one more whiskey cola to drink while looking for jimin and taehyung to tell them he\u2019s going home. he didn\u2019t even meet their fucking roommate; wonders if he got here at all. someone orders a gin and tonic next to him, and for one reason or another, it makes yoongi glance to his left. then he does a double-take, and his jaw actually goes a little slack.</p>\n<p>maybe he\u2019s drunk. maybe it\u2019s the way the light hits him. it doesn\u2019t matter, because yoongi\u2019s having an entire <em> holy shit </em> moment either way. the guy standing next to him is beautiful. right now, at least through this soft alcohol-induced filter, he looks like a damn angel; the soft slopes and angles his face is made up of, the big eyes, the shape of his lips. his thin, white shirt looks luminous in the lights and adds to the illusion of him being somewhat otherworldly. looks nice, the way it stretches across his shoulders, sleeves rolled up to his elbows, baring his forearms. <em> hot dancer arms, </em>yoongi\u2019s brain goes, even though he has no idea if the guy even is a dancer.</p>\n<p>yoongi\u2019s eyes briefly, totally non-creepily trail down his body, and that\u2019s\u2026 not\u2026 his legs remind yoongi more closely of the devil himself. and yoongi\u2019s not saying he\u2019s got like, goat hooves. what he\u2019s saying is he\u2019s fucking hot.</p>\n<p>but it\u2019s his voice, yoongi realizes as the guy asks the bartender to add ice to his drink, that sounds vaguely familiar. it\u2019s the sort of voice easy to distinguish, a unique lilt to it, soft and pleasant. <em> where have i heard it. </em></p>\n<p>the guy must feel him staring, because he turns to yoongi. they lock eyes, and yoongi thinks - it\u2019s not just the lights, or the fact that he\u2019s tipsy, it can\u2019t be. he really is that fucking beautiful. the guy keeps looking at him, and yoongi blurts:</p>\n<p>\u201cdo i know you?\u201d</p>\n<p>the beautiful guy blinks, parts his lips.</p>\n<p>\u201cis that a pickup line?\u201d he asks, tilting his head slightly, maybe vaguely amused. \u201cit\u2019s not very original.\u201d</p>\n<p>of course yoongi doesn\u2019t fucking know him, he would one hundred percent remember him. yoongi stares at the slightest curl of his mouth, before remembering to take his eyes off. he licks his lips.</p>\n<p>\u201cno, i - was genuinely wondering.\u201d</p>\n<p>the guy gives him a long look, catches his bottom lip between his teeth briefly. his eyes flick down yoongi\u2019s chest, then back up to his face, leave yoongi feeling very warm.</p>\n<p>\u201cso you\u2019re not trying to pick me up?\u201d the guy asks, slowly turning the glass on the counter. \u201cjust to clear that up.\u201d</p>\n<p><em> did you want me to? </em>yoongi almost returns, but that would make him sound like a douche.</p>\n<p>\u201cif i was trying to pick you up, i wouldn\u2019t start with \u2018do i know you\u2019,\u201d he says instead, clicking his fingernails against his glass, \u201cthat\u2019s just inadequate.\u201d</p>\n<p>the guy bites back a smile, tips his chin up. \u201cthen how would you start? hypothetically.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201chypothetically,\u201d yoongi hums, angles himself towards the guy. he looks at him for a moment, purses his lips, like he\u2019s considering. like he\u2019s calm and collected and doesn\u2019t get flustered around pretty guys who flirt with him. \u201ci\u2019d tell you you\u2019re the most attractive person at this club. probably stutter a bit because you\u2019re, like, intimidatingly good-looking.\u201d yoongi licks his lips, flicks his tongue in his mouth, pokes it into the inside of his cheek. the guy watches him, something a bit intense in his eyes. \u201ci\u2019d ask you how you are. if you\u2019re here with anyone. i\u2019d tell you my name, and ask for yours. then i\u2019d tell you i\u2019d really like to buy you a drink.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201chmm,\u201d the guy hums. his eyes crinkle a little at the corners. they look like they\u2019re shining. yoongi is pretty sure they are. like, creating their own light like little stars. \u201cyou know what, i think i\u2019d let you buy me a drink. too bad it\u2019s only hypothetical.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201ctoo bad,\u201d yoongi agrees. they look at each other for a while, and the tension makes yoongi\u2019s skin tingle, makes it feel like a challenge. the guy bites his bottom lip.</p>\n<p>\u201cmy name is jungkook,\u201d he says, \u201cand i\u2019m going to not-hypothetically ask you to buy me my next drink.\u201d</p>\n<p>a smile tugs at the corner of yoongi\u2019s mouth.</p>\n<p>\u201cthat works for me. my name is yoongi.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>/</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>yoongi is not sure where they are, because he didn\u2019t catch the address jungkook told the cab driver, and because jungkook\u2019s hand was on his thigh and yoongi was concentrating all his energy into keeping his hands to himself.</p>\n<p>it\u2019s an apartment building somewhere in seoul and that\u2019s good enough for yoongi right now. it\u2019s an apartment building with an elevator in which yoongi pins jungkook to the wall and kisses him hard until the doors ding open on whatever floor.</p>\n<p>they didn\u2019t just jump right into a cab immediately after yoongi bought him a drink, of course. jungkook wanted to return the favor, and they bought a round per each, and they talked; yoongi thinks it\u2019s the most he\u2019s ever talked with someone he\u2019s intending to hook up with. he can\u2019t claim to remember everything they talked about - they established they\u2019d both been ditched by their friends, at least - because while he liked talking to jungkook, it was very clear where this was going, what they both wanted, here. they ended up in the corner of the dance floor, after yoongi asked, <em> are you a dancer? </em>and jungkook decided to show rather than tell. yoongi is pretty sure he got an answer to that and a few other questions including how jungkook\u2019s hands feel on his ass and how his tongue feels in his mouth.</p>\n<p>the \u201cyour place or mine\u201d question was quickly decided when yoongi remembered he\u2019d been stress-cleaning just before the club.</p>\n<p>\u201cmy place looks like a nuclear site,\u201d he told jungkook outside the club, \u201ci just cleaned.\u201d</p>\n<p>jungkook stared at him for a few seconds, like he was trying to comprehend the sentence.</p>\n<p>\u201cthat makes no sense,\u201d he said while yoongi rattled the name of the club to the taxi company on the phone.</p>\n<p>\u201cit\u2019s a thing,\u201d yoongi said, and wasn\u2019t sure why he was explaining his weird behavior patterns to a guy he just met, who he was about to sleep with, but he was certainly doing that. \u201ci clean when i\u2019m stressed out and it does more harm than good. it\u2019s just me taking things out of their places and leaving them around and using the wrong detergents.\u201d</p>\n<p>jungkook just hummed, unfazed, said,</p>\n<p>\u201ci\u2019m pretty good at cleaning. i could help.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cis that what you want to do tonight?\u201d yoongi quirked an eyebrow. \u201cclean my apartment? i mean, we can do that if you absolutely want\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>jungkook grinned wide, and it made yoongi feel warm in a different way, in a way that would be slightly worrying if he had time to worry right then. he didn\u2019t, because then jungkook was shifting closer, his fingers were curling on yoongi\u2019s waist, and he was looking at yoongi with an exciting and thoroughly alluring kind of glint in his eyes.</p>\n<p>\u201cno, that\u2019s not what i want to do tonight. i have roommates, but they\u2019ll be out till late?\u201d</p>\n<p>that sounded perfectly good enough.</p>\n<p>now yoongi\u2019s got his back pressed against the inside of jungkook\u2019s front door, jungkook is kissing him hotly and wetly and eagerly, and he\u2019s sort of trying to get yoongi out of his jacket while simultaneously pinning him to the door. yoongi hums low into his mouth, pushes against him to prompt him to move backwards, drops his jacket just somewhere in the hallway.</p>\n<p>they stumble across the dark room; yoongi gets his hands under jungkook\u2019s sheer shirt, and <em> jesus, </em>he feels nice, hard muscles under his palms, an unexpectedly slim waist. he drags his nails across jungkook\u2019s abs, yanks him close when his back hits a flat surface that could be a wall or another door, and jungkook makes a noise that goes straight down his spine, rolls his hips against yoongi\u2019s. his fucking thighs have been making things hard for yoongi all night - \u201cthings\u201d covering a broad assembly of mental functions like thinking straight, but also referring to his dick - and now he\u2019s got one of those thighs shoved between yoongi\u2019s and yoongi\u2019s not sure if it\u2019s because it\u2019s been ages since he got laid and has all sorts of pent up energy or because jungkook\u2019s maybe, definitely the hottest guy he\u2019s ever touched, but he\u2019s about to explode.</p>\n<p>\u201cfuck,\u201d he chokes as jungkook tugs at his hair, and yoongi tilts his head to allow jungkook to bite and suck at his neck. <em> oh, fuck. </em></p>\n<p>\u201cmy room might be a bit messy, i just recently moved in,\u201d jungkook mumbles against his skin, the sounds telling yoongi he\u2019s fumbling for the door handle while trying not to interrupt what he\u2019s doing to yoongi\u2019s neck.</p>\n<p>\u201cyou, huh,\u201d yoongi pants, \u201cyou just moved?\u201d</p>\n<p>a connection is made somewhere in the back of his distracted brain. his eyes snap open. for a good moment, he stares at the living room over jungkook\u2019s shoulder, the furniture slowly taking shape in the darkness. his thought process over the next ten seconds is something like:</p>\n<p>\n<em> no way. it can\u2019t be -&gt; it is. oh my fucking -&gt; oh shit his thigh fuck it feels good he\u2019s so fucking hot -&gt; god it really is. -&gt; does it really matter would it be a big deal if we just -&gt; i\u2019m going to kill taehyung and then jimin and then myself </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u201cmotherfucker,\u201d yoongi rasps. jungkook goes still. he pulls back, gives yoongi a slightly startled, puzzled look. yoongi knocks his head back against the wall. \u201cnot you. the -\u201d he gestures weakly at the room. he feels like laughing and crying at the same time. \u201cthe gecko tank.\u201d</p>\n<p>he\u2019s not making a whole lot of sense and jungkook blinks at him accordingly. yoongi just can\u2019t believe he didn\u2019t recognize jimin and taehyung\u2019s apartment sooner. it\u2019s not like it\u2019s a generic-looking apartment. there\u2019s a fucking gecko tank, for starters. either he\u2019s way drunker than he thought or just too fucking turned on to process anything past jungkook and his mouth and his thighs. it\u2019s probably the second one.</p>\n<p>he forces himself to look at jungkook, who looks confused, who\u2019s still so fucking beautiful, who\u2019s jimin and taehyung\u2019s new roommate.</p>\n<p>\u201cyou\u2019re jimin and taehyung\u2019s roommate.\u201d</p>\n<p>jungkook blinks. his kiss-swollen lips part.</p>\n<p>\u201cyou know them?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cthey\u2026 yeah. oh, fuck.\u201d yoongi drags a hand through his hair. \u201cthey\u2019re my friends. they were supposed to introduce us tonight. they\u2019re the friends who ditched me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cthey\u2019re the friends who ditched <em> me</em>,\u201d jungkook says. \u201coh.\u201d</p>\n<p>they stare at each other, their chests still heaving slightly. jungkook\u2019s palm is propped against the wall above yoongi\u2019s shoulder.</p>\n<p>\u201cso this\u2026\u201d jungkook starts. yoongi licks his lips, swallows. fuck, he wants to; his body is burning with the desire to just grab jungkook, touch him, kiss him, get him out of his clothes, finish what they started. he <em> wants </em>him, so, so badly.</p>\n<p>but he can\u2019t hook up with the guy he\u2019s going to be seeing frequently, who\u2019s probably going to be an integral part of their friend group because taehyung thinks it\u2019s destiny. jimin and taehyung were excited about him, excited for everyone to meet him, and yoongi can\u2019t ruin all that for the sake of one night with him.</p>\n<p>\u201cyeah,\u201d he says, grazes his teeth over his bottom lip, \u201cwe shouldn\u2019t.\u201d</p>\n<p>he sees jungkook swallow. yoongi curls his fingers into the wall to not immediately act against his own words. fucking christ. when taehyung was telling yoongi about him\u2026 yoongi\u2019s not sure how he pictured him, but it wasn\u2019t anything close to <em> this</em>.</p>\n<p>\u201cyou\u2019re right,\u201d jungkook says, lets his hand slide off the wall. \u201cyeah, that\u2026 would make things weird in the future.\u201d</p>\n<p><em> like it\u2019s not already weird</em>, yoongi thinks, but doesn\u2019t say anything, just nods.</p>\n<p>\u201ci\u2019m just gonna go,\u201d he says, while really not wanting to go. he pushes himself off the wall, takes a step, but jungkook\u2019s fingers close around his wrist.</p>\n<p>\u201cwait,\u201d he says, and if he were to ask yoongi to sleep with him after all, yoongi\u2019s not all that certain he could walk away. he\u2019s weak, okay, and turned on, and jungkook is very attractive. jungkook seems to hesitate with his words. \u201cyou could, um. stay over. i mean, it\u2019s -\u201d he pauses to pat at his pockets for his phone, and checks the time. \u201cpast two a.m. and you\u2019re drunk. and. um.\u201d</p>\n<p>he bites at his lip lightly, and his eyes shift downwards on yoongi\u2019s body. yoongi follows them, and, oh. yeah, he\u2019s super hard in his jeans. this is not awkward at all.</p>\n<p>well, so\u2019s jungkook, so at least he\u2019s not alone. their eyes meet, and it\u2019s a weird five seconds. jungkook is flushed, sort of bothered, but determinedly staring yoongi down.</p>\n<p>\u201cokay,\u201d yoongi says weakly, \u201ci\u2019ll stay. i\u2019ll just\u2026 sleep on the couch.\u201d</p>\n<p>jungkook nods, drops his wrist.</p>\n<p>\u201cdo you, um. need the bathroom?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cyeah,\u201d yoongi says, resigned, knowing he could as well be saying, <em> hey, so i\u2019m gonna go jerk off to you in your bathroom since we can\u2019t have sex. </em>\u201ci could take a shower.\u201d</p>\n<p>jungkook sucks in a breath, nods.</p>\n<p>\u201ci can give you a towel and a change of clothes.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201ci can just ransack jimin and tae\u2019s closet,\u201d yoongi says, but jungkook\u2019s already in his bedroom. he just stands there for a few seconds, not sure what to do, until he just goes into the bathroom, clicks the lights on, squints at the sudden brightness for a while. he\u2019s greeted with his own reflection in the mirror above the sink. he looks the same way jungkook does; dishevelled and flushed, fucked up hair, swollen lips, a couple of purplish-blue bruises blooming on his neck.\u00a0</p>\n<p>he sees jungkook come up behind him.</p>\n<p>\u201chere.\u201d he hands yoongi a neat, soft pile of clothes and a towel.</p>\n<p>\u201cthanks,\u201d yoongi murmurs, and jungkook hovers in the doorway for a moment, looks like he wants to say something; but doesn\u2019t, only steps out and closes the door behind him. yoongi releases a breath.</p>\n<p>yoongi decides that this is jimin and taehyung\u2019s fault for leaving out the fact that their new roommate is the most attractive human being on earth. maybe then this wouldn\u2019t have fucking happened. but no, they couldn\u2019t even tell yoongi his fucking name, and now he\u2019s about to jerk off in their shower while a beautiful, attractive guy who was into yoongi for some reason is right there in the other room. maybe also jerking off. oh, jesus fucking christ. this is definitely the most embarrassing night anyone has ever had in the entire history of humankind.</p>\n<p>he briefly considers turning the water cold and waiting it out, then decides literally nothing matters at this point and he might as well just get it over with. he does think about jungkook and imagine his hands instead of his own but he thinks he\u2019s allowed to just this once. he doesn\u2019t take long to come. <em> fucking ridiculous</em>, he thinks as he rinses off everything that got on the shower wall.</p>\n<p>he feels significantly sober when he finishes, dries himself off with jungkook\u2019s towel. stares at the pile of clothes. the boxer briefs. this feels like a very strange order to do things in. he doesn\u2019t really know jungkook, didn\u2019t quite sleep with him, but now he\u2019s wearing his clothes.</p>\n<p>the boxer briefs are a bit loose on his hips and thighs. the rest of the clothes, the grey sweats and the white t-shirt with some sort of a pink bunny character on it, are a bit big, too. he stares at the bunny shirt in the mirror. wonders if jungkook purposely gave him this one. it probably looks cute on him. the clothes smell nice.</p>\n<p>he exits the bathroom, doesn\u2019t see jungkook. he sighs a little, gets a glass of water from the kitchen, then stalks over to the gecko tank across the room. sits down cross-legged on the carpet in front of it. the carpet is another thing that makes it fucking unbelievable yoongi didn\u2019t realize where he is. it was a housewarming gift from hoseok two years ago and the ugliest thing he\u2019s ever seen, which makes it kind of cool.</p>\n<p>\u201chey,\u201d he says, \u201cmichelangelo. leonardo. donatello. raffaello.\u201d</p>\n<p>he can actually tell the geckos apart. that\u2019s how many fucking times he\u2019s seen them on his instagram and twitter feeds. he can hear the water start running in the bathroom.</p>\n<p>\u201ci\u2019m having a weird fucking night,\u201d he tells the geckos, staring at the tank soullessly. \u201cyou ever accidentally banged your friend\u2019s roommate? no? neither have i.\u201d</p>\n<p>he decides he might as well open up to the lizards. they might even provide him with valuable advice, who knows. taehyung keeps saying they possess great intelligence.</p>\n<p>\u201ci almost kept quiet when i realized he\u2019s their roommate, you know. even now i sort of wish i had. sort of. does that make me selfish? i don\u2019t know. i don\u2019t think i could\u2019ve gone through with it in good conscience. this is the right thing to do, right? it\u2019s just\u2026 do you think this will actually make things more awkward? like, what if we needed to get it out of our systems? stop looking at me like that, leonardo, okay, i\u2019m not trying to find a justification for banging him. i\u2019m just. worried that it won\u2019t matter that we didn\u2019t go through with it and the damage is already done. what if i can\u2019t stop thinking about it? then it\u2019s either going to be fucking awkward every time i see him, or we\u2019ll avoid each other and fuck up this entire group because we can\u2019t be in the same room with each other. what then?\u201d</p>\n<p>the geckos crawl around uncaring and unaffected. raffaello trips over donatello\u2019s tail.</p>\n<p>\u201cgood talk,\u201d yoongi says.</p>\n<p>the water stops running, and another moment later the door opens. feet pad closer, and yoongi\u2019s not looking, but he can tell jungkook crouches down beside him.</p>\n<p>\u201cwere you talking to the geckos?\u201d he asks. yoongi licks his lips.</p>\n<p>\u201cthey are good listeners.\u201d he turns his head to jungkook. he\u2019s squatting almost a meter from him, arms folded on top of his knees, and he - looks different, but also not. fresh and soft from the shower, messy, damp hair, clad in a white tee and blue pajama pants. yoongi feels an entirely different kind of attraction to him, and looks away. \u201ctae named them after the artists, not the ninja turtles.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201ci know,\u201d jungkook says, \u201cit\u2019s literally the first thing he told me when i was moving in.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cyeah, he gets really offended when people mix it up.\u201d</p>\n<p>it\u2019s not an awkward silence, per se. it just feels awkward looking at jungkook. yoongi feels like he can\u2019t do that without jungkook immediately seeing all his thoughts on his face. thoughts like, <em> this was a mistake. i should\u2019ve just left. </em></p>\n<p>\u201csorry about the shirt,\u201d jungkook says, a bit sheepishly, \u201ci tried to find something else -\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cit\u2019s fine,\u201d yoongi says, glancing at him, \u201cit\u2019s cute. don\u2019t worry.\u201d</p>\n<p>jungkook looks a bit wide-eyed, prettily flushed. then he smiles lopsidedly, and yoongi\u2019s heart beats fast. why is jungkook still doing this to him, he\u2019s not looking hot at a club and grinding on yoongi on a dance floor.</p>\n<p>\u201ci actually had heard your voice before,\u201d yoongi says, \u201con the phone, when tae called me.\u201d</p>\n<p>jungkook hums.</p>\n<p>\u201cso it wasn\u2019t a pickup line. okay, i believe you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201ctold you,\u201d yoongi says, and stares at the soft curve of jungkook\u2019s smile.</p>\n<p>yoongi really wants to kiss him. he doesn\u2019t.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>/</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>yoongi wakes up, and his immediate reaction is to go back to sleep. a mild headache pulses at his temples, and the room is too fucking bright with sunlight. the mattress and the blanket are soft, and yoongi rolls over, intent on falling back asleep. his legs bump into something, and his eyes snap open.</p>\n<p>not more than five inches from him is jungkook, soundly asleep, breathing steadily with his face half buried into the pillow, facing yoongi. yoongi\u2019s heart skips several beats. he stares, for a while, barely breathing, hand clutching the sheet between them.</p>\n<p>okay. <em> calm the fuck down. </em>last night\u2026 they didn\u2019t have sex. yoongi took a shower, stayed over because he was drunk and it was late. they talked some. they just talked. he was going to sleep on the couch. then what the fuck is he doing in jungkook\u2019s bed.</p>\n<p>he breathes in and out deeply a couple of times. ah. jungkook said, <em> if you don\u2019t want jimin and taehyung to know, you could sleep in my room and sneak out before they wake up. </em>that had felt like a good idea at the time. right now, it feels less than as jungkook makes a soft, sleepy sound into the pillow and shifts closer to yoongi, and yoongi takes a slightly shaky breath, rolls away carefully to not wake jungkook up. he gets up quietly, and his head spins a little bit.</p>\n<p>he locates his phone on the nightstand. it\u2019s eight a.m.; if jimin and taehyung came home last night, they should be sleeping. there\u2019s a bunch of messages from the two of them, namjoon, and the group chat. yoongi\u2019s going to look at them later. he worries his lip, glances back at jungkook\u2019s sleeping form on the bed. it\u2019s not\u2026 an asshole thing to do to just leave, right? it\u2019s what they agreed yoongi would do. it\u2019s not like they slept together, like this is going to be anything. yoongi feels a pang of something uncomfortable, and determinedly ignores it.</p>\n<p>he\u2019s just going to leave. he can say something to jungkook when they next meet. he\u2019s not sure what, but. something. his own clothes are still in the bathroom; he\u2019s going to take them with him and return jungkook\u2019s discreetly the next time he comes around. he realizes he probably should\u2019ve asked for his phone number. well, he can\u2019t do that now.</p>\n<p>he slips out the door. the apartment is dim; looks like jimin and taehyung aren\u2019t awake. he starts walking towards the bathroom next to the hall, keeping his step light.</p>\n<p>as he\u2019s passing the kitchen, the lights blink on suddenly. yoongi freezes, stares at jimin who clicked on the kitchen light, and taehyung, who\u2019s sitting at the table with his fingers interlaced under his chin.</p>\n<p>\u201cgood morning,\u201d taehyung says.</p>\n<p>\u201cum,\u201d yoongi says. he gets a weirdly intense flashback to that one time he snuck out after curfew when he was eleven and came back to find his disappointed parents up waiting for him. \u201cthis isn\u2019t what it looks like.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cuh-huh,\u201d jimin says, raising an eyebrow and casting a pointed look at yoongi. \u201cit\u2019s early in the morning, you came out of jungkookie\u2019s room wearing his clothes, and there are hickeys on your neck. i\u2019m sure you just held hands and discussed the last book you read. seriously, yoongi?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cfucking hell,\u201d yoongi says wearily, raking a hand through his tangled hair. \u201cokay, listen -\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201csit your ass down, young man,\u201d taehyung says, pointing at the seat across from him. yoongi stares at him blankly.</p>\n<p>\u201ci\u2019m two years older than you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201csit your ass down, young man, hyung,\u201d taehyung says. yoongi groans. he walks into the kitchen reluctantly, flops down in the chair. he <em> should </em>clear misunderstandings and explain he didn\u2019t really sleep with jungkook.</p>\n<p>\u201cthe shirt suits you,\u201d jimin smirks, leaning his ass against the kitchen counter.</p>\n<p>\u201cshut up,\u201d yoongi mumbles. \u201chave you even slept? what the hell.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cdon\u2019t change the subject,\u201d taehyung says. \u201cwe found your jacket in the hallway when we came home, and suddenly it made sense why you and jungkook texted us saying you\u2019re going home almost at the exact same time. are you sneaking out on him?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cjesus, i - no,\u201d yoongi says, rubbing his hands down his face. \u201ci didn\u2019t sleep with him.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cit\u2019s fine,\u201d jimin says, \u201cyou\u2019re two adults capable of making your own decisions, you can do whatever you want as long as -\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201ci didn\u2019t sleep with him,\u201d yoongi says again, feels heat rising to his face, \u201cwe - were going to\u2026 but then i realized he\u2019s your roommate, so we\u2026 didn\u2019t.\u201d</p>\n<p>taehyung and jimin look at him for a while. yoongi would like to bail, now. on all levels except physical, he\u2019s already miles from this apartment.</p>\n<p>\u201coh,\u201d taehyung says, shares a look with jimin. tentatively, \u201cyou know, if you guys want to have a thing, you can. we support you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cno, it\u2019s - there\u2019s no thing.\u201d yoongi licks his lips. \u201cit was just a one time thing. we agreed on that. nothing happened, nothing will happen. end of story.\u201d</p>\n<p>taehyung frowns a little. they look a bit uncertain, but yoongi gets up before they can say anything.</p>\n<p>\u201ci have to go home. i\u2019ll - come back later to return his clothes. you can tell him that.\u201d</p>\n<p>isn\u2019t that going to be fun. yeah, yoongi feels a little bit like he\u2019s running away, but what else can he do. he also feels like the epitome of a fashion disaster, walking down the street in a leather jacket, a bunny shirt, and too-big sweats - and just a disaster, with the way he can\u2019t wipe the image of jungkook from his mind.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>/</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>messages from last night: a huge fucking mess. yoongi scrolls through them when he gets home and swallows two painkillers for his hangover, collapses into bed still wearing jungkook\u2019s clothes.</p>\n<p>there\u2019s namjoon asking if he got home safely, then worrying about him when he didn\u2019t answer, then threatening to call the cops, then most likely falling asleep because the messages stop there (thanks for that). (yoongi does feel bad for making him worry, and texts him an apology, saying he\u2019ll talk to him later.)</p>\n<p>there\u2019s jimin and taehyung calling him old for leaving, a video of jimin dancing shirtless, and several misspelled variations of the phrase \u201cpizzerias open 24/7\u201d, before taehyung realized he\u2019s not typing in the google search bar.</p>\n<p>in the group chat, there\u2019s a poll started by jimin on who has the best ass in the group. the people who were awake all voted for themselves. hoseok voted for seokjin\u2019s mom. seokjin changed his vote to everyone in the world except for hoseok. jimin asking where hoseok is, and hoseok saying it\u2019s under investigation and that he\u2019d get back to them in four to five hours.</p>\n<p>yoongi throws his phone onto the bed next to him, lets out a hearty groan into his pillow just to get it out of his system. why the fuck did he even go out. nothing good ever comes out of going out with taehyung, jimin and hoseok.</p>\n<p>he rolls onto his back, swallows. thinks about jungkook, probably still sleeping in his bed. thinks about what was said in the club, in the cab, in the corridors of his building. the way they danced, the way jungkook pressed him to the wall next to his bedroom door. the way they agreed nothing would happen, anymore.</p>\n<p>it was always supposed to be a one night stand, anyway. wasn\u2019t it. fuck. yoongi doesn\u2019t know what he was hoping for. sure, he was fucking attracted to jungkook - <em> was, is, was - </em> and jungkook\u2026 was feeling it back, obviously, but yoongi has no doubt he\u2019ll just move on. they\u2019ll just move on. yoongi will just move on once he can stop fucking thinking about it. a one night stand has never affected him like this before; and he didn\u2019t even <em> sleep </em>with jungkook. ugh.</p>\n<p>at least he hasn\u2019t thought about his songwriting demo project for a while. goal achieved, he guesses. fucking hurray.</p>\n<p>it\u2019s probably for the best if he doesn\u2019t see jungkook for a while. he probably won\u2019t mind if yoongi takes some time to return his clothes.</p>\n<p>his phone buzzes several times in a row, and yoongi reaches for it blindly.</p>\n<p><b>hobi</b> [9:54]<br> so im in some fishing village on the east coast<br> im getting a ride home from this nice fisherman and his daughter<br> shes making me a friendship bracelet</p>\n<p><b>jimin</b> [9:55]<br> thats cool<br> but the Most Over The Top Shit Pulled During A Night Out Award goes to yoongi</p>\n<p>\u201coh, my

would be worse if we\u2019d actually slept together<br> right?</p>\n<p><b>namjoon</b> [1:25]<br> right</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>/</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>the plan was to avoid seeing jungkook for a while - a week, two weeks, a fucking month, however long until yoongi\u2019s sure he can look at him and not be immediately reminded of how he pinned yoongi to the wall and the noises he made - but only two days later, taehyung texts the group chat, inviting everyone over the following friday.</p>\n<p><b>tae</b> [5:21]<br> we can have a movie night<br> or a game night<br> everyone can finally meet jungkook properly<br> and not only meet his lips and his dick</p>\n<p>it was unrealistic to hope they\u2019d let it go so easily, yoongi supposes, staring at the texts blankly and considering using his songwriting demo project as an excuse to not come.</p>\n<p><b>tae</b> [5:22]<br> and yoongi i know ur project isnt due for another 2 weeks so dont even think abt using that as an excuse</p>\n<p>yoongi rolls his eyes. <em> i wasn\u2019t, </em>he lies. friday would actually mark a week from\u2026 the incident, and maybe that would be good enough. maybe.</p>\n<p>to be entirely honest, yoongi is not sure if he\u2019s more scared that things will be unbearably awkward, or that he\u2019ll find himself, still, irrevocably attracted to jungkook.</p>\n<p><b>seokjin</b> [5:23]<br> no monopoly<br> or uno</p>\n<p><b>taehyung </b>[5:23]<br> weak</p>\n<p><b>seokjin </b>[5:24]<br> can you fucking blame me for not wanting to engage in a full blown war that lasts for 3 weeks and has my own bf not talking to me bc he kept landing on my property and lost all his money to me</p>\n<p><b>namjoon </b>[5:25]<br> capitalism is evil and a tool for the rich to control and oppress the weak and underprivileged</p>\n<p><b>seokjin </b>[5:25]<br> shoulda tried not being poor babe</p>\n<p>\n<em> [namjoon is typing\u2026] </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>/</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>yoongi mentally prepares for friday - by actively not thinking about it and occupying himself with the songwriting demo project and other assignments. jungkook\u2019s clothes are washed and folded in his shoulder bag, and after yoongi caught himself regretting that they now smell like his fabric softener instead of jungkook\u2019s, he banished the clothes from his mind, too.</p>\n<p>it\u2019s all going great. the project is kicking him in the ass and he ruined his curtains trying to fucking iron them for no reason and it\u2019s all he could ask for in his current situation. and then his fucking subconsciousness has to go and ruin it by giving him the fucking dream just before friday.</p>\n<p>it\u2019s more like a recollection of sounds and tastes and touches. everything he\u2019d been trying to forget. yoongi wakes up, thinking, <em> jesus christ, are you fucking kidding me. </em>he could pretend it wasn\u2019t about jungkook - it was abstract enough, the faces blurry enough - but that would simply be lying to himself.</p>\n<p>so it\u2019s with a vivid memory of the way jungkook moaned into his mouth that he goes to jimin, taehyung, and jungkook\u2019s on friday evening, sort of prepared to just fucking die.</p>\n<p>everyone\u2019s already there by the time he arrives. it\u2019s namjoon who opens the door for him, holding a beer bottle and looking sort of weary, probably because his boyfriend and taehyung are fighting over which movie to watch over on the couch, and it looks like they\u2019ve been at it for a while. yoongi quirks an eyebrow by way of greeting, and namjoon raises his beer bottle in return.</p>\n<p>\u201cit will probably be another fifteen to twenty-three minutes until the part where we actually watch a movie,\u201d he says, \u201cthere\u2019s beer in the fridge.\u201d</p>\n<p>yoongi sheds his jacket and kicks off his boots, leaves his bag leaning against the wall between the living room and the kitchen. seokjin and taehyung are loud, but he can still hear jimin and hoseok\u2019s voices from the bedroom, the door wide open. the other bedroom door is ajar. the light\u2019s on. yoongi feels an uncomfortable tingle in his stomach; feels slightly nauseous. realizes he\u2019s actually fucking nervous.</p>\n<p>he worries his bottom lip, decides that this doesn\u2019t have to be a big deal, they don\u2019t even have to really talk or spend time with each other. they don\u2019t have to immediately be friends. they just have to get along and not make things weird for everyone else. he steps into the kitchen, goes for the beer, because that sounds pretty good right now. he shuts the fridge door, and hears,</p>\n<p>\u201chey.\u201d</p>\n<p>when the bottle slips from his fingers, it could be because the sudden voice startled him, or it could be because it\u2019s that specific fucking voice that belongs to that specific person, or it could just be a coincidence. in any case, the bottle meets the floor with a loud crash, and shatters into a thousand pieces, beer pooling at yoongi\u2019s feet and canalling the cracks between the floorboards. actually, there\u2019s no way mere gravity did that kind of damage, so yoongi must\u2019ve sort of slammed it to the floor. he curses, jumps back before his socks can get wet.</p>\n<p>\u201coh, shit,\u201d jungkook says, and hurries forward to where yoongi is already crouching down to pick up shards of glass. \u201care you okay?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201ci\u2019m\u2026\u201d yoongi raises his head to find jungkook looking at him, and for a second he forgets they\u2019re hunching over a pool of glass and beer. <em> fuck me, then </em>, yoongi thinks, because he\u2019d been hoping it was his drunken mind glorifying things and making jungkook out to be more perfect than he really is, but here yoongi is, not drunk, and here jungkook is, still just as fucking attractive. it doesn\u2019t make any sense. jungkook is still waiting, his eyebrows rising ever so slightly, and yoongi chokes, \u201cfine.\u201d then he clears his throat. \u201ci\u2019m fine.\u201d</p>\n<p>jungkook licks his lips.</p>\n<p>\u201cgood. um.\u201d he casts his eyes down, starts to pick up shards. \u201ci didn\u2019t mean to startle you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cyou didn\u2019t - it just slipped. not your fault. you don\u2019t have to help me, really -\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201ci\u2019ll help.\u201d jungkook looks up again. yoongi\u2019s mind sort of blanks. \u201cyou did say you aren\u2019t good at cleaning.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201coh,\u201d yoongi says a bit faintly, \u201cyou remember that?\u201d</p>\n<p>he didn\u2019t think jungkook would - he didn\u2019t remember himself until now. and, well. it\u2019s an indication that jungkook remembers everything else, too. this is just terrific.</p>\n<p>jungkook bites his bottom lip.</p>\n<p>\u201ci do,\u201d he says, and quickly averts his eyes, gets up, palm full of glass. \u201ci\u2019ll get a floor cloth.\u201d</p>\n<p>no one else walks into the kitchen as they clean up, get rid of the shards of glass and wipe the floor down. no one heard the bottle break; that\u2019s how loud their friends are. all of it takes less than ten minutes, and before long they\u2019ve run out of things to do with their hands, and are just standing in the kitchen with an obvious strain in the air between them. <em> what the fuck now, </em> yoongi thinks, <em> do i introduce myself all over to this guy i\u2019ve already grinded with? </em></p>\n<p>jungkook is wearing light blue, ripped jeans, different from that night - <em> stop thinking about that night, honestly - </em>and a white shirt with sleeves to mid-forearms. yoongi swallows drily. he remembers jungkook\u2019s clothes in his bag.</p>\n<p>\u201cwe should\u2026 start fresh, shouldn\u2019t we?\u201d jungkook says with a short, sheepish laugh, scratching at the side of his neck. yoongi sucks in a breath.</p>\n<p>\u201cright,\u201d he agrees, and sticks his hand out. \u201cmin yoongi.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cjeon jungkook,\u201d jungkook says, and takes his hand with a small smile on his face. \u201cnice to meet you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201ci promise not to hit on you anymore,\u201d yoongi says because apparently brain to mouth filter machine broke and he\u2019d like it if someone could just fucking shoot him already.</p>\n<p>jungkook lets out a small, quiet laugh. \u201cwell. same here.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cwhere the fuck are you,\u201d taehyung yells in the living room, \u201cmovie\u2019s starting.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cyou making out?\u201d hoseok yells. \u201cagain?\u201d</p>\n<p>yoongi is suddenly aware he\u2019s still holding jungkook\u2019s hand. he lets it go like it\u2019s something seething hot.</p>\n<p>\u201ci was going to\u2026\u201d jungkook says, and gestures vaguely at the fridge yoongi is standing in front of.</p>\n<p>\u201cah.\u201d yoongi steps out of the way, then just - hovers, not sure if he should just go into the living room. he feels fucking hot in his clothes, the loose grey sweater and torn jeans.</p>\n<p>\u201cdo you want one?\u201d jungkook asks, and yoongi turns. finds a beer bottle held at him, jungkook leaning down before the open fridge door and looking up at yoongi expectantly. yoongi reaches for it automatically.</p>\n<p>\u201cthanks.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cdon\u2019t drop it, this time,\u201d jungkook says with a smile in his voice, and yoongi feels his heart do something weird.</p>\n<p>it\u2019s unbearably awkward: confirmed. yoongi is still irrevocably attracted to him: also confirmed.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>/</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cwhy are we in my bathroom,\u201d taehyung asks with blank confusion on his face. he points hesitantly at the door behind yoongi\u2019s back. \u201cthe movie -\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201ctell me something unattractive about him,\u201d yoongi says intensely. taehyung gives him a long look.</p>\n<p>\u201cwhat.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201csomething that makes him less attractive,\u201d yoongi presses, increasingly desperate, \u201cright now. tell me he\u2019s rude to stray cats or listens to country music really loud.\u201d</p>\n<p>taehyung\u2019s face gradually shifts from confused to smug as realization dawns on him. yoongi clenches his jaw and stares him down until he crosses his arms, tilts his head and looks up in consideration.</p>\n<p>\u201cwell,\u201d he says, \u201dsometimes when he\u2019s in his thoughts and he\u2019s got food in one hand and something inedible in the other, he tries to eat the inedible thing.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cthat\u2019s cute, what the fuck.\u201d yoongi twists his face like he\u2019s in physical pain. taehyung nods.</p>\n<p>\u201cit\u2019s very cute, actually.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cthat\u2019s the opposite of what you were supposed to do,\u201d yoongi complains, letting the back of his head connect with the door.</p>\n<p>\u201cso let me get this straight,\u201d taehyung says, not even trying to hide the fact that he\u2019s sadistically enjoying yoongi\u2019s agony, \u201cyou don\u2019t just want to bang him, you also think he\u2019s cute? sounds -\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cbad, i know,\u201d yoongi says.</p>\n<p>\u201ci was going to say it sounds like you want to date him,\u201d taehyung says, and yoongi can tell he\u2019s frowning even though he can\u2019t see him. \u201cwhich is not a problem, you know? just because he\u2019s our roommate -\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cit one hundred percent is a problem.\u201d yoongi detaches his head from the door and glares at taehyung. \u201cit was supposed to be a hookup. just because he was into me drunk at a club doesn\u2019t mean he wants to date me. it doesn\u2019t even mean he\u2019s in any way attracted to me when we\u2019re <em> not </em> drunk at a club. so i need to be less attracted to him at this second so i can try being friends with him.\u201d</p>\n<p>taehyung purses his lips.</p>\n<p>\u201che likes to come out of his room in the morning wrapped in his blanket like a burrito, and sometimes he falls asleep at the kitchen table like that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cstop telling me cute shit,\u201d yoongi hisses.</p>\n<p>\u201che\u2019s got a bunch of plants in his room, and sometimes he sings to them.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>fuck </em> you,\u201d yoongi snaps, \u201ci jerked off in your shower.\u201d</p>\n<p>he has time to see taehyung adopt a horrified expression, before spinning around and yanking the door open.</p>\n<p>\u201cyou guys always pee together?\u201d seokjin asks, amused, when yoongi stomps back into the living room and flops back down in the corner of the couch he occupied before deciding it was time to stage an intervention for himself and dragging taehyung into the bathroom with him.</p>\n<p>\u201cyeah, so what,\u201d he grumbles. jungkook is sat in the armchair to yoongi\u2019s right. he may or may not be looking at yoongi. yoongi pulls his feet up on the couch, hugs his knees, leans his chin on top of them and tries to make at least some kind of an attempt to figure out what the movie\u2019s about.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>/</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>he raps his knuckles against the cracked door a couple of times.</p>\n<p>\u201ccome in,\u201d a voice calls, and yoongi pushes the door open, steps through the doorway. jungkook, sitting on his bed, lowers his phone, looks up at yoongi. there are sheets of paper laid out all over the bed, notebooks spread open.</p>\n<p>\u201csorry,\u201d yoongi says, hovering, \u201cyou\u2019re in the middle of something -\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cno, it\u2019s okay,\u201d jungkook says, sliding off the bed, wiping his hands on his jeans - stains on his fingers, yoongi notes, lead? \u201cit\u2019s nothing urgent.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201ci\u2019m about to leave, so.\u201d yoongi holds out a plastic bag, inside which are jungkook\u2019s clothes. \u201cthanks for\u2026 letting me borrow them. i washed them - my fabric softener doesn\u2019t smell as good as yours, though.\"</p>\n<p>note to self: learn how to shut the fuck up sometime soon. yoongi is beginning to notice he does this thing a lot where he opens his mouth at inconvenient times and some shit comes out. he needs to fire the gremlin in charge of his brain as soon as possible.</p>\n<p>jungkook takes the clothes with a small smile and a <em> thanks, </em>and maybe it got a little less awkward as the hours passed, but now yoongi feels his insides churning again. it\u2019s probably to do with the fact that they are alone in jungkook\u2019s room. jungkook goes to set the bag on his desk, and yoongi - should probably leave, but doesn\u2019t. it\u2019s the second time he\u2019s in jungkook's room, but he didn\u2019t really have much time to pay attention that first time. he now notices: empty cardboard boxes inside one another in the corner, an iron man alarm clock, at least five succulents lined up on the windowsill. did taehyung say he works at a flower shop? was that a dream?</p>\n<p>what he finds himself fixating on, though, are the papers and notebooks on the bed. they\u2019re sketches, he realizes, good, at that, on first glance and from this angle at least. exteriors of buildings yoongi maybe knows; portraits half-hidden under other pictures.</p>\n<p>\u201ci thought you were a dancer,\u201d he says before he can think about about it and come to the conclusion that it\u2019s not something he should say because now they are both thinking about the club and that night. he bites on his tongue, forces himself to meet jungkook\u2019s eyes.</p>\n<p>\u201cdance is my minor,\u201d jungkook says, bites his bottom lip. his skin looks warm and flushed. \u201ci major in art.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201coh,\u201d yoongi only says, suddenly acutely aware that he still doesn\u2019t know jungkook but knows how his body feels against yoongi\u2019s and how he kisses, and decides he needs to leave immediately. \u201ci should get going.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cright,\u201d jungkook says, wrapping his arms around himself. \u201cgoodnight, then?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cgoodnight,\u201d yoongi says, flashing him a quick smile before hightailing it out of there. sadly, it\u2019s not that different from how he fled the scene the morning after.</p>\n<p>\u201cyoongi-hyung,\u201d jungkook calls after him when he\u2019s halfway across the living room. yoongi turns. jungkook\u2019s leaning against the doorframe, the light spilling from behind him making him look like something mere mortals are not supposed to look directly at or they\u2019ll get their eyes burned out of their heads. \u201cit was really nice to meet you? um. properly.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cyou too,\u201d yoongi agrees, and almost trips over a shoe in the hallway. note to self: also learn how to stop running away.</p>\n<p>taehyung\u2019s hawk eyes follow him from the kitchen.</p>\n<p>\u201che practices dance moves while making food in the kitchen,\u201d he sing-songs, and yoongi considers not throwing a shoe at him, he really does, for like two seconds. then he throws a shoe at him, and taehyung makes a high-pitched noise, ducks under the kitchen table. the shoe knocks a bottle of dishwashing liquid into the sink.</p>\n<p>\u201cthat\u2019s gucci, you bitch,\u201d taehyung calls, but yoongi\u2019s already out of the door.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>/</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><b>unknown </b>[4:42]<br> hi, this is jungkook!<br> i hope this isn't too weird, but are you busy right now?</p>\n<p>yoongi stares at the messages for about three minutes straight before remembering jungkook can fucking see that he\u2019s read them.</p>\n<p><b>yoongi </b>[4:45]<br> hey<br> just working on a project for a class<br> why?</p>\n<p><b>unknown </b>[4:46]<br> uh well i'm actually in the neighborhood and i thought i\u2019d ask if i could stop by<br> again, if it's not too weird<br> but if you're busy i don't want to bother you!</p>\n<p>well. it\u2019s a little bit weird. yoongi stands with a pot of coffee in his hand and wonders how jungkook knows where he lives or how he got his number. well, the answer to both of those is most likely jimin and taehyung.</p>\n<p>it\u2019s been almost a week since the movie night and since they last saw each other - five days to be exact. yoongi thinks about telling him it\u2019s a bad time and he\u2019s busy - it\u2019s not a lie, technically, since he really is working on the project. the idea of being alone with jungkook is\u2026 mildly horrifying. but: he\u2019d have to fucking get over this eventually, right?</p>\n<p><b>yoongi </b>[4:48]<br> you're not bothering me<br> i could use a break<br> text me when youre here, i\u2019ll buzz you in</p>\n<p>in less than ten minutes, there\u2019s a knock on his door. yoongi sets his coffee mug on some handwritten, coffee ring-stained notes next to his laptop, and goes to open the door, his heart beating a little bit weird, a little bit skittish.</p>\n<p>\u201chey,\u201d he says to jungkook and\u2026 a cactus, about the size of yoongi\u2019s hand, sitting in a red pot. \u201cnice cactus?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cit\u2019s for you,\u201d jungkook says, holds the plant out to yoongi. \u201cum. if you want it?\u201d</p>\n<p>yoongi takes the bizarre and unexpected gift, and invites jungkook in.</p>\n<p>\u201cit\u2019s from my work,\u201d jungkook explains, zipping down his jacket. \u201ci was going to bring it home, but i\u2019ve already got a bunch of plants there, so i asked jimin and taehyung if you\u2019d potentially like a cactus?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cah, tae said you work at a flower shop,\u201d yoongi says, and the fact that he didn\u2019t dream that up at least feels like a small victory. he blinks down at the cactus in his hands. \u201cit looks, um\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201clike a dick, yeah,\u201d jungkook says. yoongi looks up at him, and he shrugs. \u201cno one was going to buy it, because the shop\u2019s full of prettier, non-phallic ones, so i saved it from a lonely death.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201ci was going to say it looks pretty.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201coh.\u201d they look at each other for a moment. jungkook starts laughing first, the corners of his mouth twitching before giving way to a grin, his eyes crinkling at the corners, his shoulders shaking, and yoongi joins in just a moment later, just holding the dick cactus and laughing.</p>\n<p>\u201ci can\u2019t believe you brought me a dick-shaped cactus,\u201d he muses, moving things around on the coffee table to make room for the plant.</p>\n<p>\u201cwell,\u201d jungkook says, \u201ci felt like i should do something unexpected, you know?\u201d</p>\n<p>yoongi snorts. \u201cgood call.\u201d</p>\n<p>jungkook really\u2026 keeps taking him by surprise. yoongi hasn\u2019t decided if that\u2019s a good or a bad thing yet. good for making things less awkward, yes. for yoongi\u2019s feelings of attraction and other unneeded shit, not so much.</p>\n<p>they drink coffee out of mismatched mugs on the couch and jungkook tells him how to take care of cacti. yoongi learns that he works at the flower shop because taking care of plants soothes him. he also learns that when jungkook gets into a topic, he talks a lot and so fast he sometimes stumbles over his words, and yoongi finds his heart swelling in a way that doesn\u2019t remind him of the club, but instead reminds him of the small hours of that night, after they\u2019d showered and were just sitting in front of the gecko tank, talking.</p>\n<p>jungkook asks about him, about his major (music production), if he works (not at the moment), favorite foods (korean barbeque), favorite music (he can appreciate every kind of music but has a special place in his heart for hip hop). jungkook\u2019s trying to get to know him, yoongi realizes hazily somewhere in the middle of telling him about the last gig he went to (an underground rapper called sin-t); actually know him.</p>\n<p>he shouldn\u2019t be the only one who\u2019s making an effort to be friends. yoongi can be friends.</p>\n<p>jungkook eyes the notes and the laptop still opened on an unfinished track curiously.</p>\n<p>\u201cthis is the project you\u2019re working on?\u201d</p>\n<p>yoongi scrunches up his face.</p>\n<p>\u201cthe project that\u2019s been kicking my ass for three weeks straight, yeah. i\u2019ve been armwrestling with this track for a while, and i just can\u2019t get it to sound right.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201ci\u2019d love to hear it?\u201d jungkook glances up at him, wide-eyed, and backtracks, \u201ci mean, you don\u2019t have to show me, if you\u2019re not comfortable, i just. really love music, and you being in music production is super cool to me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201ci, um\u2026\u201d yoongi, sort of caught off guard and flustered, is not sure what to say. jungkook reads into his hesitance.</p>\n<p>\u201cit\u2019s okay,\u201d he says before yoongi can really say anything with substance, \u201ci shouldn\u2019t have, um, pried.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cit\u2019s fine.\u201d yoongi scratches at his neck. \u201cit\u2019s just\u2026 very unfinished.\u201d</p>\n<p>jungkook gives a small smile.</p>\n<p>\u201ci hope you find what it\u2019s missing,\u201d he says, sets his mug on the table, and gets up. \u201ci should go. i\u2019ll see you around?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201csure,\u201d yoongi nods, and walks him to the door, watches him pull on the timberlands and the bomber jacket.</p>\n<p>\u201cthank you for the coffee,\u201d jungkook turns to say.</p>\n<p>\u201cthank you for the penis plant,\u201d yoongi says, and can actually physically feel jungkook\u2019s grin getting engraved into the backs of his eyelids. he closes the door, leans his back against it for a moment, and just thinks: huh.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>/</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>yoongi is not going to google search <em> what to do when a guy you almost banged brings you a penis-shaped plant </em> - but he does text namjoon.</p>\n<p><b>yoongi </b>[7:23]<br> [image attached]</p>\n<p><b>namjoon </b>[7:25]<br> since when are you into gardening</p>\n<p><b>yoongi </b>[7:25]<br> jungkook gave it to

ironic,\u201d yoongi says, handing hoseok a can of coke and nudging at his foot with his own until he makes room on the couch. \u201cisn\u2019t it? i almost sleep with him, and then he brings me a dick-shaped plant.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cuh-huh,\u201d hoseok says with mild disinterest, browsing through netflix on the tv, searching for the crime series they\u2019ve been marathoning the past weekends. \u201clisten, when are you gonna shut up about the damn plant? if you think there might be a hidden meaning, just ask him.\u201d</p>\n<p>yoongi scoffs.</p>\n<p>\u201ci\u2019m not going to phone him up and be like, \u2018hey, so what did you mean by that dick cactus you gave me?\u2019 i <em> know </em>he didn\u2019t mean anything by it. i\u2019m just saying it\u2019s ironic.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cyeah, and i agree with you. i still think you should talk to him.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cwhy?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cbecause,\u201d hoseok sighs exasperatedly, \u201che\u2019s all you talk about. you\u2019ve clearly got some unresolved thing going on here. you give each other dick cacti and all you talk about is each other. i was at jimin, tae and kook\u2019s earlier this week and kook kept asking me about you, jesus fucking christ, guys, you know you could just talk directly to each other instead of using other people like it\u2019s a game of telephone?\u201d yoongi opens his mouth, but hoseok holds his palm at him. \u201cand no, i\u2019m not going to tell you what he asked me, because we\u2019re all twenty-something adults here and you can ask him yourself. are we going to watch this cop drama or not?\u201d</p>\n<p>yoongi stares at him. \u201cyes.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cgood,\u201d hoseok scoffs, turning back to the tv, \u201c\u2018cause i wanna know what happens to that cop who got addicted to heroin.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201che probably does some heroin,\u201d yoongi says distractedly, half-focusing on the episode as his gaze keeps falling on the cactus on the table.</p>\n<p>\u201cprobably,\u201d hoseok says.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>/</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><b>yoongi </b>[2:16]<br> [image attached]<br> this guy started blooming</p>\n<p><b>jungkook

doesn\u2019t have any real bite. he sets his phone face-down next to his half-empty americano. namjoon snorts.</p>\n<p>\u201cyou asked me to distract you from your project, but it seems to me like you\u2019re plenty distracted already,\u201d he muses. \u201cso you\u2019re doing it, after all?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cdoing what?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cgoing for it? having a thing? it\u2019s a date, right?\u201d namjoon gestures at his phone with his spoon. \u201cthe flower shop?\u201d</p>\n<p>yoongi frowns.</p>\n<p>\u201cit\u2019s not a date. why would it - it\u2019s a friend thing. we\u2019re trying to be friends.\u201d he stares at the black depths of the coffee clasped between his hands. \u201che\u2019s trying to be friends with me. i should try, too.\u201d</p>\n<p>namjoon hums.</p>\n<p>\u201cyou still wanna fuck him?\u201d</p>\n<p>yoongi, in the process of gulping down some coffee, almost chokes. he kicks namjoon in the shin under the table.</p>\n<p>\u201cwhat the hell?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cit\u2019s a valid question.\u201d namjoon shrugs. \u201cyou still like him?\u201d</p>\n<p>yoongi works his jaw, and stares at namjoon until namjoon quirks his eyebrow.</p>\n<p>\u201ci like him,\u201d yoongi says, and it comes out a bit tight and robotic. \u201ci like him in a different way. as in, he\u2019s nice. funny. seems like a good friend. he brought me a <em> plant, </em>for fuck\u2019s sake.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cyou do still want to fuck him,\u201d namjoon observes, and yoongi groans, drops his face into his hands.</p>\n<p>\u201clook. it\u2019s not like he\u2019s suddenly not hot anymore. he\u2019s hot, okay? but that\u2026 isn\u2019t going to happen anymore. now he\u2019s\u2026 jimin and tae\u2019s roommate. he\u2019s everyone\u2019s friend and i\u2019m not thinking about him like that anymore. i\u2019m <em> not.\u201d </em>namjoon doesn\u2019t look convinced. yoongi throws a crumpled napkin in his general direction. it misses him by approximately twenty meters. \u201ci don\u2019t hook up with my friends, no matter how hot they are.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cyou hooked up with hobi,\u201d namjoon points out. yoongi rolls his eyes.</p>\n<p>\u201cbarely. that was a million years ago, and\u2026 hoseok\u2019s hoseok. it wasn\u2019t awkward, it was just funny and kind of sad that it even happened.\u201d</p>\n<p>namjoon snorts.</p>\n<p>\u201cyou\u2019re right, though,\u201d he says, \u201che <em> is </em>nice. i saw him on campus the other day. i think he\u2019d just finished dance practice? i was waiting for tae to get out of acting class and he kept me company. we talked about art for like an hour.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cyeah, i know he\u2019s an art major,\u201d yoongi says distractedly, and thumbs at the edge of his cup.</p>\n<p>they\u2019ve texted a bit since jungkook unexpectedly dropped the cactus off at his place. or maybe more than a bit. first about the cactus. yoongi asking, how often do i water it, again? even though he may or may not remember jungkook\u2019s instructions perfectly. then about other things. their friends. music. art. jungkook complained to him about his mean art history professor the other day. it felt really friend-like. it\u2019s still sort of weird, but yoongi\u2019s pretty sure it\u2019s just him who\u2019s making it weird in his head. jungkook seems to be fine, which probably means he\u2019s forgotten all about it already. yoongi should be thinking that\u2019s great but instead it\u2019s giving him complicated mixed feelings.</p>\n<p>yoongi rubs at his temples.</p>\n<p>\u201ci\u2019m pretty sure i just need to get laid. bang someone who isn\u2019t him. get it out of my system.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201csure, that\u2019ll solve all your problems.\u201d</p>\n<p>yoongi raises his head.</p>\n<p>\u201care you aware you\u2019ve become like, ten times more sarcastic since you started dating seokjin?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cand he\u2019s started quoting kafka,\u201d namjoon says, \u201cwe\u2019re a good influence on each other like that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>/</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>when yoongi sets foot into the flower shop that evening, he immediately feels sort of out of place in his leather jacket and ripped jeans, even though flower shops don\u2019t have a dress code the last he checked. it\u2019s just that the place is so\u2026 pretty. delicate, somehow, with soft, earthy colors. it\u2019s a small place, at least from the outside; the inside of it is filled with more plants than yoongi would\u2019ve thought possible, lining the walls and the narrow pathways, hanging from the ceiling. it\u2019s a tidal wave of floral scents, a bit overwhelming but not unpleasant.</p>\n<p>\u201chello, can i help you find something?\u201d</p>\n<p>yoongi cranes his neck in an attempt to find the source of the voice, until his gaze lands on a short woman, maybe close to her sixties, behind a row of irises.</p>\n<p>\u201ci\u2019m actually looking for, um, jungkook?\u201d yoongi scratches behind his ear.</p>\n<p>\u201cah, the prettiest flower of them all,\u201d the woman says with a charming smile, \u201cdon\u2019t you agree?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201che. huh? uh. sure. yes.\u201d <em> get a grip, min. </em></p>\n<p>the woman points to the back of the room.</p>\n<p>\u201cyou\u2019ll find him in the other room, through there.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cthank you,\u201d yoongi mumbles, and swiftly navigates across the room, sort of disappointed but not surprised at himself. he goes through the doorway, and is met with more plants, all green houseplants of some sort. he bites his lip, travels further in. finally sees jungkook; sees his back, black shirt, the strings of the shop-green apron tied around his waist, cascading down his lower back, and - yoongi stops checking him the fuck out. <em> seriously. get a fucking grip. </em> jungkook, working, hasn\u2019t noticed him, and yoongi walks closer, realizes he\u2019s\u2026 singing.</p>\n<p>so quietly yoongi only hears him because it\u2019s otherwise silent. but he\u2019s singing, and it sounds fucking nice. his voice is soft, velvety, a unique, airy quality to it that strikes something inside yoongi because he hasn\u2019t quite heard anything like it before - and he\u2019s heard lots of voices during his years as a music production major slash music enthusiast. makes him stop, and just listen, for a while, his heart beating out an irregular, fast-paced rhythm.</p>\n<p>taehyung said he sings to his plants sometimes. taehyung warned him. oh, hell.</p>\n<p>yoongi becomes aware of just how fucking creepy it is to just stand here behind some houseplants and watch him, so he closes the remaining distance, says,</p>\n<p>\u201chey.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201coh.\u201d jungkook turns to him, wide-eyed, a blue watering can in his hand. smiles, looks genuinely happy. yoongi picks up a seedling for no fucking reason. \u201ci didn\u2019t hear you coming, sorry. i\u2019m glad you, ah, had time.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201csure.\u201d yoongi nods. he rolls the pot in his hands. \u201cyou sing to the plants?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cyou heard.\u201d jungkook gives a soft laugh and looks down at the row of seedlings. \u201cof course you did. um, sometimes? you know how they say plants grow faster if you talk to them? well. i like to sing to them.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cyou have a nice voice,\u201d yoongi says out of all the fucking things he could\u2019ve said. jungkook looks up at him, something unreadable in his eyes, and yoongi drops his eyes to the plant in his hands. \u201cdo you take vocal classes, too?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201ci do,\u201d jungkook says, \u201ci take lots of classes. i try to do a million things at once. it\u2019s always been a problem.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cif you can balance everything out, i don\u2019t see why you should limit yourself. you have interest and passion for lots of things. that\u2019s great.\u201d</p>\n<p>when yoongi looks up, jungkook is looking at him, worrying his bottom lip.</p>\n<p>\u201care you thinking of growing mint?\u201d he asks. yoongi blinks.</p>\n<p>\u201cwhat?\u201d</p>\n<p>jungkook smiles, lip still caught between his teeth. \u201cmint. the plant you\u2019re holding.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201coh. sure. why not. i like mint.\u201d he sets the pot down, anyway. \u201ci\u2019m barely keeping the dick cactus alive, you know.\u201d</p>\n<p>jungkook laughs, short and high. it makes the corner of yoongi\u2019s mouth quirk.</p>\n<p>\u201cyou\u2019re doing fine,\u201d jungkook murmurs. \u201cit looked totally healthy in the picture. have you named it, yet?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cit needs a name?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cgod, obviously.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cit does look like a dick,\u201d yoongi shrugs. \u201cthink i should name it tae?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cyeah, not bad.\u201d jungkook tilts his head, bites back a smile. he seems to consider for a moment, fingers tapping against the watering can. \u201clisten, i\u2019m\u2026 getting off in about fifteen minutes, if you want to go\u2026 grab a coffee or something, or just go home together? i mean. not home together. just. go the same way. walk, in the same direction, and then go to our separate apartments.\u201d</p>\n<p>it\u2019s almost funny; it <em> would </em>be funny if jungkook wasn\u2019t currently flushed red and if yoongi\u2019s face wasn\u2019t burning.</p>\n<p>\u201cyeah,\u201d he says quickly, \u201cyeah, that - sounds good. i\u2019ll let you finish your shift, and i\u2019ll be outside.\u201d</p>\n<p>yoongi nods a goodbye to the owner on his way out. he takes in a lungful of fresh night air which isn\u2019t all that fresh considering he\u2019s located fairly deep in the city. that wasn\u2019t so bad. that wasn\u2019t\u2026 that was bad. it was a downhill from the moment yoongi stepped into the room and found himself checking out jungkook\u2019s backside.</p>\n<p>the thing is that\u2026 they <em> are </em>becoming friends. they are talking and hanging out and getting to know each other and yoongi really likes him. taehyung wasn\u2019t exaggerating when he was hyping him up. but as their friendship is developing, the other feelings just aren\u2019t going away. they aren\u2019t getting replaced by strictly platonic feelings. instead they are just growing, along with everything else, like jungkook planted a seed inside of him the night they met. the plant he gave yoongi seems even more ironic now.</p>\n<p>yoongi leans his back against the wall of the flower shop and watches with mild disinterest as a dog pisses on a lamppost across the street. wonders if it was ever just physical. if he was already falling into something deeper at the club.</p>\n<p>the bells on the door tinkle as jungkook comes out, brushing the hair off his forehead. the apron replaced by a light hooded jacket. he smiles when he sees yoongi, and yoongi thinks this is probably the best he\u2019s ever looked. a bit sweaty, a bit tired, but loose, relaxed, happy. a smudge of dirt on his cheek. he looks so entirely human, in a way that contrasts with all those times yoongi has thought he looks ethereal. and he\u2019s still just as beautiful. that\u2019s just the thing. yoongi smiles back\u2026 he thinks. wets his dry lips, says,</p>\n<p>\u201ccoffee?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>/</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>they get coffee from the first caf\u00e9 they come across. yoongi points out the dirt on his cheek. almost wipes it off for him, but jungkook hurries up and into the bathroom before he can do something so stupid.</p>\n<p>\u201chow\u2019s your track coming along?\u201d jungkook inquires in between bites of his carrot cake.</p>\n<p>\u201ci organized my sock drawer yesterday,\u201d yoongi says dryly, \u201cso there\u2019s your answer.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201ci wish i could help,\u201d jungkook muses, \u201cwhat are you stuck on, exactly?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201csomething\u2019s missing,\u201d yoongi tells him, \u201ci\u2019ve altered it, changed the parts around, tried different samples, but every version sounds incomplete. if i don\u2019t figure it out by the deadline, i\u2019ll just have to submit the one i hate the least. i hate doing that. submitting work i\u2019m not one hundred percent happy with.\u201d</p>\n<p>jungkook hums. \u201ci\u2019m a perfectionist, too. i used to beat myself up pretty badly when things didn\u2019t go as planned. i\u2019m trying to learn out of it. learn that i can\u2019t be perfect at everything every time and that the point is to just try, do your best, then try again.\u201d</p>\n<p>yoongi studies him for a moment, warming his fingertips against the coffee cup.</p>\n<p>\u201cyou're a freshman, right? how do you already sound so wise in your freshman year. i was a mess.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cthat\u2019s implying you\u2019re not a mess anymore,\u201d jungkook muses, and yoongi snorts so loudly and suddenly that he almost spits coffee everywhere.</p>\n<p>\u201cyeah, i can see why everyone likes you,\u201d he half-jokes, and thinks, staring at jungkook\u2019s wide, bunny-toothed grin, that he\u2019s really saying something slightly different.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>/</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><b>yoongi </b>[1:13]<br> remembre when we hooked up

hyung</p>\n<p><br> <br> /</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>the next afternoon, jungkook appears at his door with a sprout. whether it\u2019s the same one yoongi was fiddling with at the flower shop, he can\u2019t tell because it\u2019s a fucking sprout.</p>\n<p>\u201cmint,\u201d jungkook says with a lopsided smile, and offers the potted plant to him. \u201csince you\u2019re doing so well with the cactus, you might like a little bit more challenge. and it needs a friend, anyway.\u201d</p>\n<p><em> sing for the plants, </em>is what yoongi means to ask as jungkook finds a spot for the mint on the kitchen table. somehow, it comes out as,</p>\n<p>\u201csing for me.\u201d</p>\n<p>jungkook\u2019s fingers on the pot go still. he turns to look at yoongi, who\u2019s holding his breath. his heart hammering against his ribcage.</p>\n<p>\u201ci mean. the track,\u201d he says, \u201ci\u2019d like to try\u2026 adding your voice. if you\u2019re fine with it.\u201d</p>\n<p>jungkook blinks, opens and closes his mouth.</p>\n<p>\u201ci\u2026 you want my voice? you\u2019ve barely heard me singing -\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cyour voice has that dream-like feeling to it i\u2019m looking for,\u201d yoongi says. his face feels hot, but he forces himself to look jungkook in the eye and articulate clearly, calmly. \u201cit wouldn\u2019t be singing any real lyrics - a couple of words at most - and just harmonizing. but if you\u2019re not comfortable doing it - i mean, i know this is sudden -\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201ci can do it,\u201d jungkook says, and almost looks like he\u2019s surprised himself.</p>\n<p>\u201cyou can?\u201d jungkook nods, and yoongi finally releases a breath. \u201cthank you. thanks, this - this might save me, you know.\u201d</p>\n<p>jungkook lets out a laugh, some of the tension in his shoulders seemingly easing.</p>\n<p>\u201cthat\u2019s a bit dramatic. i\u2019m just - happy if i can help.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201ci\u2019ll show you the track.\u201d</p>\n<p>they crowd yoongi\u2019s couch, yoongi plays him all the versions of the track. jungkook listens intently, eyes closed, fingertips pressing on the headphones over his ears. yoongi watches him with his heart thudding frantically. he realizes how much he wants jungkook to like the song. they\u2019ve known each other for about a month, it\u2019s mostly been an awkward encounter after the other, but still jungkook\u2019s approval means a lot to him.</p>\n<p>jungkook plays all of them twice, and it\u2019s all silent in the apartment, just the occasional patter of feet in the corridor and the barely audible music from the headphones. finally he lowers them around his neck, turns to yoongi, a smile playing on his lips. something playing on his face, that yoongi can\u2019t describe.</p>\n<p>\u201cyou make beautiful music,\u201d jungkook says, \u201cit\u2019s sort of not what i was expecting from you? style-wise. not that i really know what i was expecting - but it\u2019s still very\u2026 you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cthank you,\u201d yoongi hears himself say. jungkook turns back to the laptop, and reaches to glide his finger on the touchpad.</p>\n<p>\u201ci like all of them, but i like the second one the best. okay if i try some harmonies to it?\u201d</p>\n<p>they must spend hours on it - the shadows grow longer and suddenly the scenery from the window is void of sunlight. yoongi writes up some words, and jungkook sings, and it\u2019s almost unbelievable how much the track improves simply by adding jungkook\u2019s voice to it.</p>\n<p>\u201cthis will work,\u201d yoongi says, raking a hand through his hair, \u201cthis will sound good. oh, my god. you\u2019re like an angel.\u201d</p>\n<p>jungkook laughs - giggles, really, with the back of his hand covering his mouth, pink cheeks, and yoongi\u2019s heart rate would probably have something to say about that if he wasn\u2019t so overwhelmingly relieved right now.</p>\n<p>\u201ci kinda have to hurry with this,\u201d yoongi says, \u201care you free on friday? i could book the studio and we could record the vocals.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cyeah - yeah, sure.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cthank you so much, honestly.\u201d yoongi sinks back on the couch, angles his upper body to jungkook. \u201chow can i repay you for this?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cyou don\u2019t have to repay me,\u201d jungkook starts to say, but yoongi holds an index finger a couple of inches from his face.</p>\n<p>\u201clet me at least buy you dinner.\u201d</p>\n<p>jungkook parts his lips. for a moment yoongi thinks he\u2019s going to say no; but then he looks away, either at the laptop or the yellow coffee mug or the cactus, and smiles.</p>\n<p>\u201ci like lamb skewers,\u201d he says, and yoongi curls his fingers against his thighs, says,</p>\n<p>\u201clamb skewers it is.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>/</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>friday comes, and with it an itch that could be excitement or nervousness or both. the studio at the music department is like a second home. yoongi gets everything ready, then rolls around the room in the swivel chair, then checks out taehyung\u2019s latest lizard updates on social media - he\u2019s making them tiny ninja turtles costumes for halloween; yoongi likes the picture on instagram because it\u2019s kind of cute and taehyung is doing a really good job with the costumes - then texts namjoon.</p>\n<p><b>yoongi </b>[3:52]<br> hey</p>\n<p><b>namjoon </b>[3:53]<br> whats wrong<br> are you at the studio?<br> youre recording with kook today right?<br> did sth happen?<br> need me to call the ambulance?</p>\n<p><b>yoongi </b>[3:54]<br> all i did was say hey</p>\n<p><b>namjoon </b>[3:55]<br> the last time you texted me a plain \u201chey\u201d you had a fork stuck to your thigh and were bleeding to death on your kitchen floor</p>\n<p><b>yoongi</b> [3:55]<br> ok fair</p>\n<p><b>namjoon</b> [3:56]<br> is your life/someone elses life in immediate danger?</p>\n<p><b>yoongi </b>[3:56]<br> no<br> maybe<br> im nervous</p>\n<p><b>namjoon </b>[3:57]<br> oh for fucks sake yoongi<br> i thought you were dying but youre just nervous bc your crush is about to sing for you</p>\n<p><b>yoongi </b>[3:58]<br> hes not my crush</p>\n<p><b>namjoon </b>[3:58]<br> sorry i meant<br> *the guy you were initially attracted to sexually but are now discovering its not just physical</p>\n<p><b>yoongi </b>[3:59]<br> you kno what fuck you<br> blocked forever</p>\n<p><b>namjoon </b>[3:59]<br> jin says suck his dick</p>\n<p>the door opens, and yoongi comes very close to reflexively slam dunking his phone to the floor.</p>\n<p>\u201chey,\u201d jungkook says, \u201ci wasn\u2019t sure if i should knock, but, um. i\u2019m here.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cyeah, no, come in. i\u2019ve got everything set up, so we can start as soon as you\u2019re ready.\u201d</p>\n<p>jungkook closes the door behind him; yoongi attempts to take him in quickly and subtly and ends up staring. he\u2019s got a duffel bag slung over a shoulder; he\u2019s in a casual getup, sweats, a black print tee, unzipped hoodie and a black beanie. he looks comfy, effortlessly good.</p>\n<p>\u201csorry, i just finished dance practice,\u201d jungkook grimaces, crosses the floor to set his bag on the bench by the wall, \u201ci look sorta terrible.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cyeah, terrible,\u201d yoongi mumbles, turning back to the computer, \u201ccan\u2019t even look at you.\u201d</p>\n<p>when he glances to his right, jungkook has gravitated close, hand propped against the desk and peeking at the screen over yoongi\u2019s shoulder, a smile pulling at the corners of his mouth. yoongi feels sort of faint. he can smell his bodywash or deodorant, whichever, and hazily tries to put his finger on the scent. mango, maybe. maybe satsuma.</p>\n<p>\u201cyou can step into the booth if you\u2019re ready,\u201d he says.</p>\n<p><em> fuck namjoon, </em> yoongi thinks as jungkook secures the headphones over his ears on the other side of the glass, <em> fuck seokjin and hoseok, too. </em>he probably needs better friends, when he thinks about it.</p>\n<p>\u201chyung?\u201d comes jungkook\u2019s voice in yoongi\u2019s headphones. yoongi clicks his mic on.</p>\n<p>\u201cyeah?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201ci\u2019m kind of nervous, to be honest,\u201d jungkook says with a breathy laugh that fills yoongi\u2019s ears completely, fills him, and it feels like he\u2019s so <em> close. </em> the last time was when - <em> don\u2019t fucking think about that, jesus. </em>\u201ci mean, you\u2019re putting your trust in me, and i want to do good -\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cyou will. jungkook.\u201d they lock eyes. \u201cdon\u2019t be nervous. i\u2019m not pressuring you - but i know you\u2019re going to do good, because guess what? you\u2019re good. you\u2019re better than good and i owe you at least twenty skewers for this.\u201d</p>\n<p>jungkook grins, and it makes 1. yoongi smile back and 2. his heart beat faster.</p>\n<p>\u201cmake that twenty-five.\u201d</p>\n<p>yoongi shakes his head. \u201cyou want to negotiate about this now? also, you can eat twenty-five skewers in one sitting?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201ci\u2019m a man of many talents,\u201d jungkook says.</p>\n<p>then he sings, and yoongi has to take one pad off his ear because it\u2019s so much, sort of. it\u2019s his own fault, partly, for writing the song like that. jungkook sings with a lot of emotion in his voice, and yoongi clenches his jaw as he listens, eyes fixed somewhere on the control table.</p>\n<p>they do five takes, mainly because jungkook is not entirely satisfied - they had the conversation about perfectionism, and yoongi thinks this is an instance where jungkook is slipping back to his old habits despite trying to learn out of it.</p>\n<p>\u201c- yoongi?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cthat was good,\u201d yoongi says, slips both pads over his ears again, \u201cthat was perfect. that was - that\u2019s it. that\u2019s the song.\u201d</p>\n<p>his sincerity seems to convince jungkook, who lets out a breath - again, it feels like he\u2019s so close, the hairs on yoongi\u2019s nape standing up - and smiles, a pretty pink on his cheeks.</p>\n<p>\u201ci\u2019m going to take you up on that dinner later tonight.\u201d</p>\n<p>good god, the way yoongi\u2019s chest feels like there\u2019s a fire inside. smoke filling up his lungs, snaking up his throat and slipping past his lips.</p>\n<p>he\u2019s glad there\u2019s a glass separating them. he would kiss jungkook, were they in the same room.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>/</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>in the end, yoongi panics and invites namjoon and seokjin out for the skewers with them. he knows they talked about it like it would be just the two of them, though technically it was never specified - but it shouldn\u2019t matter, right? they are friends, after all, the more the merrier or what the fuck ever, and yoongi\u2019s still paying for jungkook\u2019s food. and it really would seem like it doesn\u2019t matter - jungkook seems fine with it, engulfed in conversation about photography with namjoon - were it not for the way seokjin\u2019s been pointedly staring at him over the tabletop for a good five minutes now.</p>\n<p>\u201cyoongi and i are going to the bathroom,\u201d he announces suddenly. namjoon and jungkook stop talking. yoongi fixes him with an intense glare.</p>\n<p>\u201cno we\u2019re not,\u201d he says.</p>\n<p>\u201cyes we are,\u201d seokjin says and could be subtler in his kicking yoongi in the shin because he does it a little too hard and yoongi nearly doubles over.</p>\n<p>\u201cfine, we are,\u201d he says through gritted teeth.</p>\n<p>\u201cwe\u2019re big on pissing together in this friend group,\u201d he hears namjoon say to jungkook as he grudgingly clambers up and after seokjin.</p>\n<p>\u201ci think i\u2019ll pass,\u201d jungkook replies.</p>\n<p>\u201cwhat\u2019d you kick me so hard for,\u201d yoongi complains once they are in the bathroom, leaning against the weird orange-y wall and rubbing his denim-covered shin. \u201cthis is going to bruise.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cwant to tell me what we\u2019re doing here?\u201d seokjin asks, crossing his arms and standing in front of him. to random people seeing this, it probably looks like he\u2019s getting jumped by a tall, broad guy in a bathroom.</p>\n<p>\u201cyou <em> dragged </em>me in here.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cnot the bathroom,\u201d seokjin rolls his eyes, \u201cwhy are we invading your date?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cit\u2019s not a date.\u201d someone comes out of one of the cubicles, and yoongi adopts his best wide-eyed, innocent look. \u201chelp, i\u2019m being threatened.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201coh, fuck off, yoongi,\u201d seokjin groans, and relaxes his posture. he turns to the guy who\u2019s sort of hovering and eyeing them uncertainly. \u201cwe\u2019re friends. no need to call the police.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cright,\u201d the guy mumbles.</p>\n<p>\u201caren\u2019t you going to wash your hands?\u201d seokjin asks, and the guy freezes with his hand on the doorknob.</p>\n<p>\u201cgross, dude, you\u2019re in a restaurant. you should wash your hands,\u201d yoongi says. the guy gives them sort of a bewildered look and quickly slinks out of the door.</p>\n<p>\u201cthat was just disgusting,\u201d seokjin says, turning back to yoongi.</p>\n<p>\u201cit was,\u201d yoongi agrees.</p>\n<p>\u201cyou were going to come with just jungkook, but panicked at the last minute and invited us, didn\u2019t you?\u201d seokjin doesn\u2019t really give him a chance to answer. \u201cthe hell are you doing, yoongi?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201ci don\u2019t know,\u201d yoongi says, pained. \u201cit\u2019s - being alone with him - i thought i could do it, but it\u2019s\u2026 weird. i feel weird.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cyou feel weird,\u201d seokjin repeats, and looks thoroughly unimpressed. \u201cyou sound like you\u2019ve never had a crush before and are figuring out the human emotion called love.\u201d</p>\n<p>yoongi groans quietly.</p>\n<p>\u201cthis is why i talk to namjoon about these things, and not you. you\u2019re mean.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201ci\u2019m not mean. i\u2019m just calling you out on your bullshit. <em> talk </em>to him. tell him how you feel before you do something stupid like try to fuck the feelings away.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cyou\u2019re now policing who i can fuck?\u201d yoongi snaps a bit harshly. \u201cafter i\u2019ve told him how i feel and he\u2019s turned me down, am i then good to fuck whoever i want?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201ccome on, yoongi -\u201d seokjin starts, eyebrows knitting together, and yoongi knows, distantly, that it\u2019s not what he was saying at all, but he\u2019s not governed by logic, right now. he pushes past seokjin before he can finish his sentence, shoves the door open. he strides back to their table while taking deep breaths and trying to calm the irrational anger boiling inside him. he\u2019s not angry at seokjin, who just happened to be standing in the way, and attracted yoongi\u2019s burst of anger like tall objects do to lightning. at the core, he\u2019s angry at himself and no one else.</p>\n<p>he sees jungkook, leaning forward on his seat to talk to namjoon, his eyes big and animated, and decides he can\u2019t do this. maybe some other day. right now, he can\u2019t do this.</p>\n<p>\u201csomething came up,\u201d he says once he\u2019s standing by the table. he collects his jacket from the seat, mechanically digs his wallet out of the pocket. \u201csorry. i have to go. we can have a retake another time.\u201d</p>\n<p>he takes out a bunch of bills and sets them on the table. he can feel both of them staring at him.</p>\n<p>\u201cis everything okay?\u201d jungkook asks hesitantly. yoongi looks up, meets his eyes. he looks genuinely worried and confused. yoongi\u2019s heart and head hurt.</p>\n<p>\u201cyeah, it\u2019s fine. i just remembered a deadline.\u201d he produces a tight smile, and shrugs his jacket on. namjoon is frowning at him; he saw through yoongi immediately, knows he doesn\u2019t have a deadline, but is not calling him out.</p>\n<p>\u201csorry,\u201d he says quietly, directed at jungkook, \u201cthank you again, for the vocals. eat as much as you want. i\u2019ll catch up with you later.\u201d</p>\n<p>note to self (urgent): FUCKING LEARN HOW TO STOP RUNNING AWAY.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>/</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>yoongi makes a bad decision. he makes those from time to time. keeps things interesting. it would get awfully boring, having his life together like an actual functional, emotionally stable human being.</p>\n<p>this particular decision is exceptionally bad, even for him, and he is acutely aware of this the entire time he\u2019s carrying through with it.</p>\n<p>\u201cyou seem angry,\u201d the guy huffs into his ear, his hands on yoongi\u2019s waist too careful and too tight and just wrong in ways yoongi can\u2019t pinpoint, \u201ci like that.\u201d</p>\n<p>yoongi, with his eyes squeezed shut, eyebrows drawn together, decides he\u2019d rather not hear him talk.</p>\n<p>\u201cshut up. shut up and just fuck me.\u201d</p>\n<p>he feels like shit afterwards. he\u2019s not sure how he was expecting to feel, but there\u2019s none of the sense of satisfaction that usually follows a night of unwinding through meaningless sex. he gets home in the early morning, takes an hour long shower, eats half a piece of toast, and slips into a coma as soon as his face makes contact with a pillow.</p>\n<p>when he wakes up, it\u2019s already getting dark out. he fumbles for his phone, disoriented and not knowing what day or year it is, only to find his phone is dead. gradually, he registers the sound that probably pulled him from his slumber in the first place: someone\u2019s knocking on his door, the sharp sound of knuckles on wood echoing through the apartment not unlike gunshots.</p>\n<p>yoongi drags himself up, his head spinning a little bit, shuffles barefoot to the door. doesn\u2019t think to check the peephole first because he\u2019s not awake enough.</p>\n<p>\u201coh,\u201d jungkook says, his fist hovering in the air. yoongi blinks at him, and when his brain finally catches up, he nearly shuts the door in his face.</p>\n<p>he - yoongi - looks bad, like he woke up two seconds ago because he <em> did, </em>his hair an ungodly mess on his head, stretched out t-shirt he wears to bed and pajama bottoms he\u2019s had since he was sixteen, whereas jungkook looks good like he always does, and that\u2019s a bit much for yoongi to handle right now.</p>\n<p>\u201csorry, did i - wake you? i just came by unannounced, someone let me in, a lady with a poodle -\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cit\u2019s okay.\u201d his voice sounds rough. he steps aside, holds the door open. \u201ccome in.\u201d</p>\n<p>jungkook steps past the threshold.</p>\n<p>\u201ci just\u2026 wanted to check in on you?\u201d yoongi looks at him blankly, sort of still in the middle of processing that jungkook\u2019s <em> here, </em>and jungkook licks his lips, shifts his weight from one foot to the other. \u201cyou haven\u2019t answered your phone in almost twenty-four hours. the others said you haven\u2019t replied to them, either. and i mean - that\u2019s fine, you don\u2019t have to be always available, but since you left in a hurry yesterday\u2026 i just\u2026 worried. i guess.\u201d</p>\n<p>he says the last part quietly, his gaze falling a bit short of yoongi\u2019s eyes.</p>\n<p>\u201coh,\u201d yoongi breathes. drags a hand through his tangled hair. \u201ci\u2019m sorry. i didn\u2019t realize it had been that long. i didn\u2019t mean to worry you.\u201d</p>\n<p>jungkook stares at the region around yoongi\u2019s neck and shoulder a bit long, and yoongi\u2019s heart drops to his stomach when he realizes. he\u2019s got marks on his neck from last night. bruises, he cursed at them in the shower. he stares at jungkook, unblinking, unbreathing, and it feels like an eternity before jungkook rips his eyes away from his neck and meets his eyes - in reality it\u2019s probably barely five seconds.</p>\n<p>yoongi knows how it looks; it looks like he lied in order to go bang someone - which is exactly what happened, isn\u2019t it. it may not have been the reason he left early, but technicalities aside, it\u2019s what happened, and jungkook was worried about him, and yoongi is a complete fucking asshole.</p>\n<p>yoongi is not sure what the look on his face means, if it means anything - he\u2019s sure he\u2019s imagining things that aren\u2019t there into his eyes.</p>\n<p>\u201cit\u2019s okay. i\u2019m just glad you\u2019re, you know. alive.\u201d jungkook gives a smile. he averts his eyes before yoongi can determine whether the smile reaches them. he\u2019s not taking off his outerwear, yoongi notes. wonders if he was ever going to stay for long, if the marks on his neck changed something. jungkook reaches into his bag; pulls out something tiny and green and alive.</p>\n<p>\u201ci brought something for you,\u201d he says softly, and takes the couple of steps between them. yoongi holds out his hands automatically; jungkook places in them a tiny little plant, not much larger than his thumb, a sprout with a bunch of unbloomed yellowish flowers. \u201cit\u2019s a primrose. she\u2019s a special one because she was left really stunted and i didn\u2019t think she was going to make it. i like to think it was because i sang to her that she pulled through.\u201d jungkook looks up at him and smiles. he gets so gentle sometimes. gentle everywhere, his smile, the look in his eyes, his voice, his hands still partly overlapping with yoongi\u2019s.</p>\n<p>yoongi realizes:<em> i\u2019m falling in love with him. </em></p>\n<p>\u201cshe\u2019s just starting,\u201d jungkook says quietly, \u201cplease take good care of her.\u201d</p>\n<p>after jungkook leaves, yoongi stands there holding the primrose for a long time. he feels a prickle in his eyes, and wipes the back of his hand over his lids, frustrated. what the fuck is he crying about. it\u2019s his own fucking mess. it\u2019s his own fault jungkook is too fucking good for him.</p>\n<p>he sets all three of his plants on the coffee table in a neat row. then he brings his dead cellphone back to life, and feels exponentially worse after seeing the messages and missed calls from jungkook. the others, too, especially namjoon wanting to know what happened at the restaurant. everyone asking if he\u2019s okay, even though it\u2019s not the weirdest thing for him to have quiet days where he doesn\u2019t really contact anyone. he lets them know there\u2019s no need to pronounce him dead in the group chat.</p>\n<p>there\u2019s also a bunch of messages from seokjin.</p>\n<p><b>seokjin </b>[1:08]<br> yoongi<br> about what happened at the restaurant<br> that wasnt what i was saying but im sorry if it came out that way, and i may have been a little too harsh</p>\n<p><b>seokjin </b>[1:10]<br> i was honestly just trying to help because youre my friend and i love you<br> sorry i meddled</p>\n<p><b>seokjin </b>[3:02]<br> are you alive?<br> please let someone know</p>\n<p><b>yoongi </b>[6:18]<br> i know<br> sorry i drank your expensive herbal tea that time</p>\n<p><b>seokjin </b>[6:19]<br> its okay<br> it tasted so bad</p>\n<p><b>yoongi </b>[6:20]<br> it really did</p>\n<p><b>seokjin </b>[6:20]<br> can i come over?<br> i can bring peanut butter brownies</p>\n<p><b>yoongi </b>[6:21]<br> did you make them yourself</p>\n<p><b>seokjin </b>[6:21]<br> of course<br> im not a fraud</p>\n<p><b>yoongi </b>[6:22]<br> then yes you may</p>\n<p>seokjin comes over with a massive tupperware box full of brownies. yoongi, wrapped in a huge grey cardigan that he\u2019s pretty sure belongs to one of his friends, makes grabby hands for the box.</p>\n<p>\u201ci take back everything i\u2019ve ever said about wanting to trade you for that nice barista at that caf\u00e9 on campus.\u201d</p>\n<p>seokjin holds it out of his reach.</p>\n<p>\u201cyou\u2019ve said that?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cit was namjoon. namjoon said that. i\u2019ve never said anything bad about you in my life. i think you\u2019re an integral and indispensable part of this friend group.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cthat\u2019s what i thought,\u201d seokjin snorts.</p>\n<p>he also brought ice cream to eat with the brownies and yoongi\u2019s never loved a man more in his entire life. they sit on the couch and put on a romcom neither of them really concentrates on.</p>\n<p>\u201cyour garden is growing,\u201d seokjin notes, pointing his spoon at the plants on the table. yoongi draws his knees to his chest.</p>\n<p>\u201cjungkook brought me the primrose today,\u201d he murmurs, and looks at the tiny plant with some kind of misplaced affection. seokjin is quiet for a moment.</p>\n<p>\u201che was really worried,\u201d he says then, \u201cafter you left the restaurant. he thought he did something wrong.\u201d yoongi whips his head around. seokjin\u2019s already looking at him like he knows exactly what he\u2019s thinking. \u201ci told him it wasn\u2019t because of him. that you were stressed out because of other things.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201ci slept with someone,\u201d yoongi says, because seokjin already knows. and yoongi knows he won\u2019t judge, he does know despite snapping at him in the restaurant bathroom.</p>\n<p>\u201cdid it make you feel better?\u201d seokjin inquires.</p>\n<p>\u201cno.\u201d yoongi leans his cheek on top of his knee and picks at the worn hem of the cardigan. \u201ci\u2019m falling in love with him and it feels terrible.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cthat\u2019s falling in love, for you,\u201d seokjin states, \u201cwelcome to the club.\u201d</p>\n<p>yoongi breathes out heavily in a semblance of a laugh.</p>\n<p>\u201ci\u2019m an asshole,\u201d he says.</p>\n<p>\u201cyou\u2019re a bit emotionally stunted at times,\u201d seokjin says with a smile, \u201cbut you\u2019ve never been an asshole, yoongi.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cstunted,\u201d yoongi mumbles, \u201clike the primrose.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201csure,\u201d seokjin says, and definitely has no idea what yoongi is talking about. \u201cyou just gotta - wait. is this my cardigan?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cyou can\u2019t have it back,\u201d yoongi says, pulling away from seokjin\u2019s probing hands, \u201cno! i\u2019m emotionally stunted and falling in love!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cthose aren\u2019t valid reasons for sick leave,\u201d seokjin grunts, \u201ci want my damn cardigan.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>/</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><em> think about how this looks to jungkook, </em> seokjin said, <em> he has no idea you have feelings for him. how could he? you\u2019re now sleeping with other people after almost sleeping with him, and that\u2019s what he thinks he was ever going to be to you. talk to him. </em></p>\n<p><em> right, </em>yoongi agreed, and then didn\u2019t talk to jungkook that day or the next or the day after that, and jungkook didn\u2019t text him either. in his defense, he lost track of time, having his hands and his head full with the track he edited and submitted, and then let play and replay under the excuse that jungkook said his singing helps the plants grow strong. yoongi knows, realistically, that it probably has to do with carbon dioxide or something and so playing a recorded voice doesn\u2019t make a lot of sense, but that\u2019s beside the point.</p>\n<p>after some hesitation, he sends the finished track to jungkook. hesitates over what the accompanying words should be; <em> sounds good, doesn\u2019t it? i\u2019m sort of in love with you. </em>he doesn\u2019t write anything and just sends the file. jungkook doesn\u2019t text him back that day, or the next day.</p>\n<p>\u201cyou really are tiny, huh,\u201d yoongi mumbles, crouched down at the coffee table, caressing the leaves carefully with his fingertip. he feels terribly attached to the plant and might know exactly why. might be channeling some of the feelings he has for jungkook into taking care of the plant. maybe he\u2019s trying to prove some kind of a point. that stunted plants can bloom, too.</p>\n<p>halloween shouldn\u2019t come as a surprise because it\u2019s literally on the same day every fucking year. still, he wakes up on the thirty-first to a reminder from jimin and taehyung to dress up for the halloween party at their place, another yearly occurrence, thinking, <em> where the fuck did the past few days go, </em>and realizing he\u2019s going to have to go to the party and see jungkook there and he still hasn\u2019t talked to him.</p>\n<p>there seems to have been some discord when it comes to planning outfits, because jimin, taehyung and hoseok are in a full-blown argument about it when yoongi arrives.</p>\n<p>\u201cwe were all supposed to be sexy ghostbusters,\u201d hoseok whines, \u201cnow i look stupid.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em> now </em>you look stupid?\u201d seokjin asks, like he isn\u2019t the least qualified person in the room to make that comment in his\u2026 yoongi\u2019s not sure what he\u2019s wearing, but he\u2019s sure it\u2019ll come up at some point.</p>\n<p>\u201cno, we changed that when i decided to make ninja turtle costumes for the geckos,\u201d insists taehyung, who\u2019s trying to arrange his geckos neatly into jimin\u2019s hands to get a picture. they are wearing little tortoise shells and carefully made color-coded face masks. it\u2019s fucking adorable. \u201cyou know we have to match the geckos.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cwho are you, the woman from kill bill?\u201d yoongi asks taehyung.</p>\n<p>\u201cno, you uncultured swine,\u201d taehyung narrows his eyes, \u201ci\u2019m april o\u2019neil, from the ninja turtles. i\u2019m wearing a red wig, not blonde, come on.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cand you\u2019re\u2026 the killer from friday the thirteenth?\u201d yoongi turns to jimin, who has a hockey mask pushed up his forehead, and who\u2019s struggling with his hands full of geckos.</p>\n<p>\u201cyou know what?\u201d jimin says. \u201ci might as well be. i wanted to be a sexy ghostbuster. no one even knows these characters from the ninja turtles.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201ceveryone knows april o\u2019neil and casey jones,\u201d taehyung scoffs, \u201chobi was supposed to be master splinter.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cyou wanted me to be a stick-wielding sewer rat,\u201d hoseok frowns, \u201cthere\u2019s no way i can make that sexy.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cwhy does it have to be sexy,\u201d yoongi asks incredulously.</p>\n<p>\u201cask me what i am,\u201d seokjin says loudly to no one in particular.</p>\n<p>\u201cwhat are you, seokjin?\u201d hoseok asks obediently.</p>\n<p>\u201ca sandwitch,\u201d seokjin says, then waits with his lips trembling with the effort not to laugh. when no one says anything, he gestures first to his body, which is sandwiched between two giant pieces of toast, then to his witch hat. \u201csand<em> witch. </em>get it?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cand you are?\u201d hoseok asks namjoon, who\u2019s standing next to seokjin and looking rather dead on his feet.</p>\n<p>\u201cdating a fucking moron,\u201d namjoon says wearily.</p>\n<p>\u201csay it,\u201d seokjin prompts, bumping into namjoon with his sandwich body. \u201csay it, namjoon.\u201d</p>\n<p>namjoon looks like his soul has left this mortal coil ages ago.</p>\n<p>\u201ca cereal killer,\u201d he says tonelessly. seokjin looks excited enough for the both of them, turning to the rest of the room and beaming.</p>\n<p>\u201cget -\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cyes, we get it,\u201d they reply in a choir. namjoon\u2019s wearing a carton modelled after a box of honey nut cheerios with holes for his arms and head.</p>\n<p>\u201ci have trouble moving through doorways and performing basic tasks,\u201d he says.</p>\n<p>\u201cwe\u2019ve known that for years, namjoon,\u201d jimin says.</p>\n<p>\u201che didn\u2019t give you a real knife?\u201d yoongi asks, referring to the foam knife in namjoon\u2019s hand.</p>\n<p>\u201che knows i\u2019d stab him to death with it,\u201d namjoon replies calmly.</p>\n<p>\u201ci\u2019m pretty sure there\u2019s a joke there to be made about the honey nut,\u201d hoseok muses.</p>\n<p>\u201cjust kill me,\u201d namjoon says, and tries to bury his face in his hands, but the box is in the way, so he just sort of flails around uselessly. honestly, it\u2019s kind of sad to watch.</p>\n<p>\u201cand what are you supposed to be?\u201d taehyung migrates to yoongi, ignoring the way jimin, still holding the geckos, glares after him. he scrutinizes yoongi\u2019s appearance with his arms crossed over the tight yellow overalls that show just enough cleavage to make people slightly uncomfortable. yoongi points up at the cat ears he\u2019s wearing. taehyung doesn\u2019t look impressed. \u201cyou put on cat ears, hyung. that\u2019s underwhelming. are you at least also wearing a tail?\u201d</p>\n<p>taehyung goes to straight up grab yoongi\u2019s ass. yoongi jumps, then worms out of taehyung\u2019s reach.</p>\n<p>\u201cno, i\u2019m not wearing a fucking tail, stop it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cthat\u2019s okay, there\u2019s one in me and jimin\u2019s bedroom, i can get it for you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cwhy do you have -\u201d yoongi cuts himself off, and stares at taehyung blankly. \u201cnever mind. don\u2019t tell me. and don\u2019t get it. if you try to put a tail on me, i\u2019m walking out of here.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cwhere\u2019s jungkook?\u201d he picks up someone asking. he had sort of automatically scanned the room for jungkook immediately upon walking in, until the chaos taking place occupied his mind. but jungkook really isn\u2019t here.</p>\n<p>\u201che\u2019s going to be a little late,\u201d taehyung says, \u201cyou know, as always. he\u2019s got another halloween thing with his dance class, the traitor.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cthe last time jungkook was late, yoongi ended up nearly banging him,\u201d hoseok quips, \u201ctry not to do that this time, yoongi.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201coh, my god,\u201d yoongi mumbles, and slinks into the kitchen to put some alcohol into his system. he finds a bowl of punch, thinks, <em> perfect, </em>because it tastes like it\u2019s about eighty percent pure vodka.</p>\n<p>the party\u2019s slowly getting started; when jimin and taehyung threw the first one three years ago, there were so many people not everyone could fit into the apartment, and there were people just hanging out in the corridor. they admitted they got a little too ambitious after receiving a bunch of complaints about noise and someone allegedly riding the elevator down naked, and it\u2019s become more and more a thing just for them, the core group, since then.</p>\n<p>the playlist is the happy, poppy kind of halloween music instead of, like, creepy horror movie soundtracks, they\u2019re in the middle of a variation of king\u2019s cup, and yoongi\u2019s working his way towards satisfyingly buzzed by the time jungkook comes. someone whistles, and yoongi looks up at the door at the sound of it closing.</p>\n<p>\u201chow was the <em> other party, </em>cheater,\u201d taehyung calls over the music.</p>\n<p>\u201cit was okay,\u201d jungkook says, then snickers at the offended sound taehyung makes while taking off his combat boots. \u201ci stole a bottle of gin and like an entire plastic bag of jelly beans?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cyou\u2019re forgiven,\u201d taehyung decides.</p>\n<p>jungkook walks into the living room, carrying the gin in one hand and the bag of jelly beans in the other, and yoongi\u2019s mouth goes a bit dry.</p>\n<p>he had briefly wondered what jungkook was going to dress up as, had sort of worried about something like <em> this </em>happening, then decided to just drink and cross that bridge when he came to it. well, he\u2019s at that fucking bridge, and jungkook is -</p>\n<p>\u201cyou\u2019re a sexy policeman?\u201d he blurts. jungkook\u2019s eyes land on him, and stay on him, and everyone in the room has gone quiet. jungkook\u2019s eyes flick to the cat ears; he parts his lips, and then hoseok makes a noise that sounds like he\u2019s choking.</p>\n<p>\u201ci... think he\u2019s just a regular policeman, yoongi,\u201d he says, and then he starts laughing.</p>\n<p>yoongi\u2019s face is currently on fire, and he can\u2019t seem to remember how to look away from jungkook, who\u2019s staring back, his eyes wide and cheeks dusted with pink.</p>\n<p>\u201ci lost,\u201d yoongi mumbles, throws his card into the pile, downs his drink, and gets up, blood pooling in his legs and causing black spots to dance in his vision.</p>\n<p>\u201cyou can\u2019t lose at this game,\u201d jimin remarks. yoongi begs to differ.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>/</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cwhat is this, the shame corner?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cthat\u2019s exactly what it is.\u201d yoongi gestures vaguely at his immediate surroundings. it\u2019s jimin and taehyung\u2019s bedroom. he\u2019s got himself a nice little corner by the window, he\u2019s sitting on the floor with punch in the biggest cup - it\u2019s more like a carafe, really - he could find in the kitchen, browsing through a photo album taehyung left out, dedicated to horrific party snapshots dating back to three years ago, patiently removing the most incriminating ones of himself. there\u2019s a black cat tail hanging off the headboard. shame corner is accurate. \u201ctell me that wasn\u2019t the most embarrassing thing anyone\u2019s ever done. i dare you.\u201d</p>\n<p>namjoon waddles closer a bit awkwardly. his cereal box looks a little beat up from squeezing through doorways.</p>\n<p>\u201cnah, you\u2019re correct. if someone had taken a picture of your face, it would\u2019ve made the highlight spot in the clown book. who is it, this time?\u201d</p>\n<p>yoongi flips to the first page, where there\u2019s a single photo attached below a doodle of a crown and the title, <em> clown of the moment. </em></p>\n<p>\u201cit\u2019s jimin, hanging out of the window at hobi\u2019s birthday party after his ass got stuck.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cyeah, this is more embarrassing than that.\u201d namjoon plops down on the floor with yoongi, folding his limbs inside the costume, so that it\u2019s just his head poking out of a giant honey nut cheerios box. he watches yoongi detach a photo that involves a cowboy hat and a mechanical bull and neatly set it into the small pile next to him. \u201ci think that counts as spoliation of evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201ci am merely relocating them for a while. until i put into action my plan to fake my death and move countries. then it\u2019s whatever.\u201d yoongi holds out his drink for namjoon to sip through the straw.</p>\n<p>\u201ci can\u2019t even fucking drink by myself,\u201d namjoon sighs. yoongi snorts.</p>\n<p>\u201cwhy did you agree to wear that, then,\u201d he asks.</p>\n<p>\u201cbecause i love him and i want to make him happy,\u201d namjoon replies easily. \u201cyou know how he gets on halloween. the places he can go with the costumes and the puns. it\u2019s like christmas for him.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cyou guys are so functional and healthy and compatible,\u201d yoongi sighs, \u201ctone it down, honestly. or share.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cactually,\u201d namjoon says, his tone getting very soft, \u201cwe haven\u2019t told anyone else yet, but. when i\u2019m done with college, we\u2019re thinking of getting married.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201choly shit.\u201d yoongi blinks. \u201cthat\u2019s great. that\u2019s - incredible. woah.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cyeah,\u201d namjoon gives a quick laugh and smiles with his dimples. \u201ci mean, we\u2019re still just talking about it, but\u2026 yeah.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201ci\u2019d hug you, but i\u2019d be essentially just hugging the box,\u201d yoongi says.</p>\n<p>\u201clet\u2019s do an awkward box hug,\u201d namjoon prompts and sticks his arms out of the arm holes. yoongi shuffles forward and hugs the box, while namjoon\u2019s fingertips barely brush at his shoulders. it\u2019s very awkward and nice.</p>\n<p>\u201ci\u2019m happy for you,\u201d yoongi says sincerely.</p>\n<p>\u201cthank you,\u201d namjoon hums, and yoongi can hear his smile. he settles back against the wall, and shakes his head.</p>\n<p>\u201cyou guys are in such a different place with your life. i can\u2019t even ask the guy i like on a date without first acting out a comprehensive guide of things you should not do.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cyou\u2019ll get there,\u201d namjoon promises. \u201cnot hiding from him would be a good start.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cyeah, i\u2019ll do my time first,\u201d yoongi says, flipping to a random page of the clown book. \u201ci sentenced myself to twenty-five minutes of shame corner.\u201d he stops mid-flip, and does a double-take on a photo. \u201cthe hell? was it hobi who rode the elevator down naked?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201coh, yeah, it was a dare,\u201d namjoon says, \u201che\u2019s on all the security footage. he was banned from the building for like three months.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201chuh,\u201d yoongi mumbles.</p>\n<p>\u201ci\u2019ll leave you to your shame corner,\u201d namjoon says, getting up and making a slightly unsteady turn for the door.</p>\n<p>\u201cgo nut in your honey, cheerio,\u201d yoongi says.</p>\n<p>\u201cyou <em> should </em>be in the shame corner,\u201d namjoon turns to hiss. \u201cthat\u2019s how people have been saying goodbye to me all night. i fucking hate this.\u201d</p>\n<p>yoongi snorts to himself, turns his gaze back down at the photo album. there are no photos of jungkook yet. there probably will be after tonight. he hears namjoon apologize to someone in the doorway; then jungkook says, <em> it\u2019s okay, i didn\u2019t spill any, </em>and he freezes.</p>\n<p>\u201care you looking for yoongi?\u201d namjoon asks.</p>\n<p>\u201ci\u2026 yeah, i am.\u201d</p>\n<p>yoongi stuffs the photos into his back pocket, aware that namjoon\u2019s stalling and giving him time to prepare mentally, and gets up. namjoon glances back at him once he steps out of the corner, and jungkook, behind his shoulder, meets yoongi\u2019s eyes.</p>\n<p>\u201cseems you found him,\u201d namjoon says, turning back to jungkook after apparently finding a confirmation on yoongi\u2019s face. he pats jungkook\u2019s shoulder a bit awkwardly. \u201cbe good, kids. do you know where seokjin is?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cin the bathroom,\u201d jungkook says, \u201che\u2019s patching up taehyung. he got stabbed by a gecko.\u201d</p>\n<p>namjoon just looks at him for a while. then he decides not to ask further questions, and just leaves. based on experience, it\u2019s probably exactly what it sounds like.</p>\n<p>yoongi is left with jungkook in the doorway and his sweating palms. jungkook sets his drink by the drawer outside the door, then steps in, all careful and somewhat tense in his movements, and yoongi\u2019s not sure if it\u2019s because yoongi made things awkward again, or if he\u2019s nervous; yoongi\u2019s not entirely sure what jungkook has to be nervous about, though. yoongi keeps proving himself to be a fucking mess, not someone to be nervous around.</p>\n<p>\u201chey,\u201d jungkook says, softly.</p>\n<p>\u201chey.\u201d yoongi leans his back against the closet right behind him, wraps his arms around himself loosely. he\u2019s mentally caught somewhere between fight and flight as jungkook walks closer; <em> stop running away, </em>a voice in the back of his head says. it sounds vaguely like himself. also vaguely like the guy who sells vacuum cleaners on the shopping channel at four a.m. for some reason.</p>\n<p>yoongi knows he was supposed to talk to him, but god, there could not be a worse timing. firstly, they\u2019ve been drinking. secondly, his mind very much blanks when he looks at jungkook.</p>\n<p>yoongi still firmly believes he can\u2019t be blamed for messing up earlier. okay, so it\u2019s not a sexy costume in that it\u2019s not a parody of the original thing, but that makes it <em> sexier, </em>like, actually, dangerously sexy instead of ridiculous-sexy. it\u2019s a uniform, first of all, those are already attractive, and the fact that it\u2019s a uniform on jungkook is just an overkill at this point. mostly it\u2019s his arms. it\u2019s more arm than yoongi\u2019s ever seen on him, the sleeves short and hugging his biceps closely. it\u2019s also the way the belt accentuates his waist and his thighs, and the way the uniform is tight across his chest, and also the way his hair parts on his forehead. it\u2019s just all of him, basically, it\u2019s just him, and being this gone for someone is getting exhausting.</p>\n<p>yoongi is painfully aware he\u2019s one hundred percent transparent, too. he\u2019s been flushed since jungkook walked in, and it\u2019s not like it\u2019s ever been a secret that he finds jungkook hot. he made it pretty clear the night they met, and just in case anyone was wondering, <em> hmm, is yoongi still attracted to jungkook, </em>wonder no more! less than an hour ago he called him sexy in front of all their friends!</p>\n<p><em> monaco, </em> yoongi thinks, <em> monaco sounds nice. </em>he could move to monaco, once he\u2019s gotten his passport renewed.</p>\n<p>\u201ci was looking for you,\u201d jungkook says, and yoongi already knew that, but doesn\u2019t say anything, just bites his tongue and watches jungkook approach slowly. \u201ci wanted to tell you\u2026 i listened to the song. i\u2019m sorry i didn\u2019t, um. have a chance to reply. but it was beautiful. you made me sound good.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cdon\u2019t need me for that,\u201d yoongi says. his voice sounds a bit hoarse. \u201cyou already sound good.\u201d</p>\n<p>jungkook is close. yoongi keeps his eyes on him even though he can feel his face burning up. he\u2019s not entirely sure what jungkook is doing here, what the look in his eyes means, why it feels like he\u2019s after something specific. jungkook leans a shoulder on the closet beside yoongi.</p>\n<p>\u201ci haven\u2019t seen you in a while,\u201d he says quietly, \u201cmissed you, i think.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cmissed you too,\u201d yoongi manages, increasingly confused and close to gay panic. the tip of jungkook\u2019s tongue darts out, wets his bottom lip.</p>\n<p>\u201csexy policeman, hyung?\u201d he says it with a smile ghosting on his lips; but there\u2019s something heavy and intense in his eyes that makes yoongi think it\u2019s a loaded question, a loaded smile. he swallows dryly.</p>\n<p>\u201cin my defence,\u201d he says, \u201cthat uniform looks way too tight on you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cyeah, well. it\u2019s from last year, and i\u2019ve gained muscle since then.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cuh-huh,\u201d yoongi says weakly, convinced jungkook is trying to fucking kill him. he could at least have the decency to be quick about it. jungkook catches his bottom lip between his teeth.</p>\n<p>\u201ci like the cat ears.\u201d jungkook detaches his shoulder from the closet door, and leans closer, reaches up to touch an ear, and although yoongi can\u2019t even feel it, a shiver runs down his spine. \u201cit\u2019s cute. you look good.\u201d</p>\n<p>yoongi\u2019s heart is beating very fast.</p>\n<p>jungkook moves. suddenly he\u2019s trapping yoongi against the closet, hands on either side of his head. yoongi\u2019s breath catches in his throat, and then jungkook leans in, in, until his chest touches yoongi\u2019s chest, and his lips touch yoongi\u2019s lips.</p>\n<p>\n<em> what, what the fuck - </em>\n</p>\n<p>jungkook\u2019s lips are soft against his, and yoongi closes his eyes, kisses him back automatically. jungkook\u2019s knee is between his legs, his entire body pressed against yoongi\u2019s. yoongi is pretty sure his hands come up to jungkook\u2019s chest - his mind swims a little, and he lets jungkook pry his lips apart with his own, his tongue sliding across yoongi\u2019s bottom lip. he tastes like the horrible punch, alcohol and orange juice.</p>\n<p>\n<em> that\u2019s what he thinks he was ever going to be to you. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u201cwhat,\u201d yoongi mumbles against his lips, fingers pressing down above his collarbones, \u201cwhat are you doing?\u201d</p>\n<p>jungkook pulls away, enough to look at him.</p>\n<p>\u201ci,\u201d jungkook presses his teeth into his bottom lip. he blinks slowly, like he\u2019s just taking yoongi into focus. \u201ci thought you\u2019d still want to. have sex.\u201d</p>\n<p>it\u2019s - not what he wants, at all, or it is, but that\u2019s not <em> all </em>, not nearly. it hurts, it starts from his chest below his ribs and spreads, like a - like a damn plant growing, like a prickly cactus, or stinging nettles.</p>\n<p>\u201cno, i - kook -\u201d at his hesitation, something a bit frantic settles on jungkook\u2019s face.</p>\n<p>\u201cshit,\u201d he whispers, \u201csorry, i\u2019m so sorry. please, just - forget about this.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cjungkook -\u201d before yoongi can get a sentence out, jungkook has pulled away, and then he\u2019s gone, out of the room, leaving only the remnants of his body heat all over yoongi.</p>\n<p>\"fuck, fuck fuck,\u201d he says to no one, knocking his head back against the closet. then, <em> i need to go after him. </em>run towards instead of away.</p>\n<p>the people in the living room are oblivious to everything that just took place.</p>\n<p>\u201cwhy would you give the geckos <em> knives,\u201d </em>namjoon is screaming, \u201cwhy would you weaponize your lizards? how is that not a terrible idea in every conceivable way?\"</p>\n<p>\u201cfor accuracy, namjoon,\u201d taehyung says exasperatedly, \u201cthey weren\u2019t even real knives, they were plastic - i didn\u2019t know they\u2019d be so sharp or that they'd learn to use them -\u201d</p>\n<p>jungkook\u2019s boots are gone. yoongi doesn\u2019t stop to think, just pulls on his shoes and grabs the first jacket he sees that resembles his own - it\u2019s not his own, he establishes in the corridor, it\u2019s too big and looks like a thrift store bomber jacket from the nineties. he shrugs it on nonetheless as he speed walks to the elevator; the light is on, jungkook\u2019s riding it down, and yoongi curses, takes a deep breath, before heading for the stairs. it\u2019s eight floors. it\u2019s not that bad.</p>\n<p>it is that bad. he has to stop between the third and fourth floor, hands on his knees and feeling like he\u2019s going to throw up. note to self: do some cardio or something. he\u2019s half dead by the time he reaches the bottom floor, shoves the front door open. cool night air hits his face; the sky is dark and muddy, and the only light is from the streetlights, storefronts farther away. he jogs through the courtyard, to the street strewn with dead leaves. he looks around; sees no sign of jungkook, nothing to indicate which way he went. an unease settles into the pit of his stomach, nausea and mild panic. jungkook is somewhere on the streets, drunk and alone.</p>\n<p>there\u2019s a group of people coming down the street towards him, loud, drunk students in costumes. yoongi goes to them.</p>\n<p>\u201chave you seen a cop?\u201d he asks, trying to catch his breath. \u201ca guy, dressed as a cop? this tall? uh, attractive?\u201d jesus fucking hell, as if jungkook\u2019s most identifying characteristic at the moment wasn\u2019t the police uniform. he grimaces, gestures uselessly with his hand again. \u201c...a cop?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cwow, a kitty,\u201d a girl coos, \u201ccute.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201ci think i\u2019ve seen like ten people dressed as cops tonight,\u201d one of the guys says. yoongi grits his teeth.</p>\n<p>\u201cdid you see one, coming this way, just a moment ago?\u201d he presses.</p>\n<p>\u201ci saw a cop,\u201d a girl dressed as tinkerbell pipes in, \u201cat the intersection. don\u2019t know which way he went.\u201d</p>\n<p>yoongi breathes out.</p>\n<p>\u201cthanks,\u201d he tells tinkerbell, ignores the first girl who asks him to come with them. then he runs. the intersection is not far, and chances are he might see jungkook from there. someone catcalls him, and yoongi doesn\u2019t even bother flipping them off this time.</p>\n<p>a comprehensive guide, honestly. <em> step twenty-nine: make him think you don\u2019t want him, at all. </em></p>\n<p>he could\u2019ve let that happen, he could\u2019ve - if that\u2019s what jungkook wants, they could\u2019ve just slept together, kept it casual, he\u2019s done it before with hoseok - but hoseok was right, this is different in every way, and he can\u2019t. he can\u2019t when he\u2019s falling in love or maybe already past the falling stage and it wouldn\u2019t be fair to anyone, not to himself and not to jungkook either, and yoongi needs to find him, tell him - that he does want him but he wants all of him and even if jungkook doesn\u2019t reciprocate, he should know.</p>\n<p>\u201coh my god,\u201d he mumbles to himself once he reaches the intersection, tasting blood in his mouth.</p>\n<p>\u201chyung?\u201d</p>\n<p>yoongi turns; finds himself looking at jungkook, not more than two meters from him. he\u2019s looking at yoongi like he\u2019s the last thing he expected to see here at this street corner, which -</p>\n<p>\u201cdo you think i wouldn\u2019t come after you? you -\u201d yoongi stares at him, chest heaving as he pants. \u201cyou\u2019re not even wearing a jacket, what the fuck -\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201care you\u2026 are you okay?\u201d jungkook takes a hesitant step forward. he looks slightly alarmed.</p>\n<p>\u201cno, i think i\u2019m about to pass out,\u201d yoongi admits. \u201chow did you get so far so <em> fast.\u201d </em></p>\n<p>\u201clong legs? i -\u201d jungkook looks helpless. \u201cwhy are you here?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201care you kidding me?\u201d yoongi grumbles. he begins to strip off the oversized nineties thrift shop jacket. \u201cyou just <em> left, </em>kook, and it\u2019s dark and cold and you\u2019re drunk, and where were you even going?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201ci was going to come back,\u201d jungkook says defensively, wide eyes following yoongi\u2019s movements as he shucks the jacket and steps closer, the tips of their shoes knocking together.</p>\n<p>\u201cput this on,\u201d yoongi mumbles, already reaching up to wrap the jacket around his shoulders. jungkook breathes in unevenly, and for a moment yoongi thinks he\u2019s going to pull away, but he stays still.</p>\n<p>\u201ci\u2019m not cold,\u201d he starts to say.</p>\n<p>\u201cjust wear it, jungkook,\u201d yoongi says, quietly, but jungkook drops further protests immediately. yoongi doesn\u2019t let go of the jacket even when it\u2019s draped over his shoulders. stares at his fists clutching the lapels, brow furrowed like he\u2019s angry. swallows down the burning feeling in his throat, the stinging nettles pushing upwards and choking him, and focuses on the rise and fall of jungkook\u2019s chest under his fists.</p>\n<p>\u201ci\u2019m sorry,\u201d jungkook whispers, almost too quiet to hear, \u201ci\u2019m sorry, i shouldn\u2019t have assumed you still wanted - just because you did that time -\u201d</p>\n<p>they\u2019re too drunk for this, yoongi acknowledges. decides it\u2019s time to sober up. he lifts his head.</p>\n<p>\u201ccome with me,\u201d he says, hand falling to jungkook\u2019s wrist, giving a gentle tug.</p>\n<p>yoongi takes him to a diner a couple of blocks down the street. it\u2019s still quiet, the drunk people hunting for fast food wouldn\u2019t be stumbling in for another couple of hours. they take a corner table, and yoongi coaxes jungkook into telling him he likes banana milkshakes, then orders him that along with some fries and two large sodas.</p>\n<p>\u201ci was supposed to make up for that time at the skewer place, wasn\u2019t i,\u201d yoongi says, \u201ca crappy diner at one a.m. is not really what i had in mind.\u201d</p>\n<p>coaxes a small smile out of him, too. he watches jungkook as they wait for their food to come, sitting across from him with his shoulders slouching slightly, playing with the sleeves that come up to his fingertips. yoongi\u2019s pretty sure the jacket belongs to namjoon, now that he looks at it in proper lighting. jungkook looks soft and tired and sad and still like the most beautiful thing yoongi\u2019s ever seen. it\u2019s cheesy. it\u2019s also the truth. yoongi\u2019s got himself in some deep shit.</p>\n<p>jungkook slumps bonelessly against the table, lets his head fall into his arms.</p>\n<p>\u201cwanna know something?\u201d he asks, a bit muffled. \u201cthat night at the club. i\u2019ve never done anything like that before. taken someone i just met home.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cokay,\u201d yoongi says slowly. jungkook lifts his head enough to peek at him over his sleeves.</p>\n<p>\u201cyou weren\u2019t only hot,\u201d he says, \u201cyou were nice. and funny. and kind.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cand you\u2019re drunk,\u201d yoongi says quietly, reaches to tug at a strand falling into his eyes. jungkook just shakes his head, looks at yoongi under his eyelashes.</p>\n<p>\u201chyung,\u201d he says. their food arrives before he can continue that thought, and yoongi practically shoves the milkshake and the fries at him.</p>\n<p>\u201ceat, okay? eat before we talk. i need us sober.\u201d</p>\n<p>this is not how he planned he would do this, in a crappy diner at one in the morning. not that he really planned at all. jungkook drinks the milkshake with both of his hands wrapped around it, fingertips peeking out of the sleeves. yoongi drinks the soda just to have something to do, doesn\u2019t even taste anything besides cold. he has no idea how people do this. put themselves out there, lay their hearts bare. even now, he\u2019s terrified of getting hurt, even though he doesn\u2019t like admitting it. jungkook would let him down gently, if he had to, yoongi knows he would, because that\u2019s what he is: gentle. but it wouldn\u2019t matter, because there\u2019s no gentleness in this thing of stinging nettles inside yoongi, and he\u2019d be left with the plants around his apartment to remind him, either way.</p>\n<p>there\u2019s something lamentably hilarious about this. he\u2019s about to do the clich\u00e9 romcom grand finale confession scene with a guy who\u2019s way too good for him in every way, and he\u2019s wearing fucking cat ears. yoongi coughs out a sudden, humorless laugh. jungkook looks up at him, wide, pretty eyes. yoongi sighs, and just says it.</p>\n<p>\u201ci like you.\u201d it rolls off his tongue surprisingly easily, and it sounds like he\u2019s apologizing. \u201ci more than like you. i think i fell in love with you. i\u2019m sorry.\u201d now he\u2019s actually apologizing. he bites his lips, stubbornly keeps looking at jungkook, because he should look him in the eye when he says this - while trying not to read into his expressions, and just focusing on not stumbling on his words. he curls his fingers on the checkered tablecloth. \u201cthat\u2019s why i stopped you, in the bedroom. i can\u2019t do the casual thing. i want more. i want you, i want everything with you. i want to date you, and - it\u2019s okay if you don\u2019t want that. i\u2019m not expecting you to feel the same way. i just thought you should know. that there hasn\u2019t been a second i haven\u2019t wanted you.\u201d</p>\n<p>jungkook slams the milkshake onto the table so hard it creates a resounding, hollow thud.</p>\n<p>\u201cthank god,\u201d he says loudly. yoongi blinks.</p>\n<p>\u201cwh-\u201d</p>\n<p>jungkook springs to his feet, the oversized jacket sliding off one shoulder. before yoongi can process what\u2019s happening, he\u2019s all but climbing over the table, bending over the width of it. then his fist is in yoongi\u2019s shirt front, yanking him forward.</p>\n<p>\u201coh,\u201d yoongi mumbles against his lips. it\u2019s not a great kiss, exactly, their mouths mushed together awkwardly, yoongi halfway off the seat, held up by his slightly shaky arms and jungkook\u2019s grip on his shirt, and he\u2019s pretty sure he has his fingers in a pile of ketchup - but -</p>\n<p>\u201ci don\u2019t want the casual thing either,\u201d jungkook breathes quickly, separating enough to look yoongi in the eye. his eyes are big and sincere and sort of breathtaking.</p>\n<p>\u201cbut you - tonight -\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201ci thought that was what you wanted.\u201d jungkook worries his bottom lip, his eyebrows knitting together in a slightly pained expression. \u201ci thought if that was the only way i could have you, then i\u2019d take it. i thought it\u2019d be better than not having you at all. but it wouldn\u2019t have been better, it - would\u2019ve just hurt more.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cyou -\u201d yoongi swallows. \u201cyou want -\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cwant you too,\u201d jungkook murmurs, \u201cwant you entirely. want to - go on dates with you, raise plants with you -\u201d</p>\n<p>yoongi kisses him again. he\u2019s distantly aware this must look ridiculous; the table between them, and jungkook\u2019s definitely getting ketchup on his cheek because yoongi is holding his face; but he couldn\u2019t give less of a fuck.</p>\n<p>\u201clisten, this is very awkward for me,\u201d says the weary employer standing by their table, \u201cbut you guys are getting ketchup, like, literally everywhere, so <em> please\u2026 </em>could you stop making out on the food. i\u2019m on minimum wage.\u201d</p>\n<p>as they are leaving, and yoongi pulls out his wallet to pay, something falls out of his pocket. jungkook bends down to pick it up, examines the photo in his hand wordlessly, and then looks up at yoongi.</p>\n<p>\u201cwhy do you carry a picture of yourself in a cowboy hat riding a mechanical bull in your pocket?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201ci hand it out to people i meet, like a business card,\u201d yoongi says, slapping a couple of extra bills on the table to say, <em> sorry for making out on the food, </em>not even caring that his initial intention was to keep jungkook from seeing the pictures.</p>\n<p>\u201cit\u2019s good photography,\u201d jungkook muses as they walk out, \u201cit looks like whoever took it captured the moment right before you broke fifteen bones.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201chow frail do you think i am? i only broke one,\u201d yoongi says, his fingers tangling in jungkook\u2019s jacket sleeve. \u201ccan i hold your hand?\u201d</p>\n<p>the dimple that appears on his cheek is a tiny shadow in the dim streetlights. jungkook slides his fingers into the spaces between yoongi\u2019s, and squeezes tightly. yoongi feels sort of lightheaded, windswept, like he rushed into happiness, and holds onto jungkook\u2019s hand like he\u2019s holding on for his life.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>/</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>jungkook pulls him close in the elevator, and yoongi loops his arms around his waist inside the jacket. <em> warm, </em>he thinks when jungkook\u2019s arms envelop him, when jungkook\u2019s soft mouth brushes against his.</p>\n<p>\u201cbeen here before,\u201d jungkook murmurs, means the time they kissed in the elevator the night they met.</p>\n<p>\u201cthis is better,\u201d yoongi whispers, means something like, <em> i like kissing you as a boyfriend rather than a one night stand. </em></p>\n<p>there\u2019s the <em> ding </em>that announces they\u2019ve arrived, the doors sliding open, and someone saying,</p>\n<p>\u201coh, my god.\u201d</p>\n<p>yoongi pulls away from jungkook just in time to barely catch his own cellphone that comes flying at his chest. he looks up to find his whole entire friend group, which at the moment consists of two obscure ninja turtles characters, a sexy ghostbuster, a sandwich, and a box of honey nut cheerios, standing outside the elevator, their reactions and facial expressions ranging from sort of fondly exasperated to really fucking pissed off.</p>\n<p>\u201cyou guys finally decided to bone,\u201d hoseok says, throwing his head back, \u201cthank fucking god. now you can leave me out of your sexually tense drama.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201care you fucking kidding me?\u201d taehyung screeches. he\u2019s also the one who threw the phone. \u201cwe were about to go out as a search party to look for you. neither of you took your damn phones with you. we thought you\u2019d been taken by the mafia or the men in black.\u201d he adds, in the same cranky tone: \u201ci\u2019m super happy for you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cdon\u2019t say \u2018we\u2019 when you\u2019re the only one who thought that,\u201d jimin says.</p>\n<p>\u201cis that blood on my jacket?\u201d namjoon stares at the ketchup-stained jacket on jungkook. then he looks up at them, and asks, completely seriously, \u201cdid you kill someone?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cyour career,\u201d yoongi says, and reaches behind jungkook to punch at the buttons repeatedly. \u201cclose, dammit.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201ci\u2019m in college, i don\u2019t have a career,\u201d namjoon says.</p>\n<p>\u201ci guess you could say you guys... started with a bang,\u201d seokjin says as the elevator doors begin to mercifully slide shut. \u201cget it? because when they met, they almost -\u201d</p>\n<p>yoongi doesn\u2019t catch the rest, because then the doors are closed and they are on their way down again, and jungkook\u2019s laughing into his hair, and yoongi\u2019s grinning, and sure, he\u2019s looking forward to finally actually banging, maybe sometime soon, whenever jungkook wants, it doesn\u2019t matter; but he\u2019s also looking forward to things he didn\u2019t dare to consider before, but now feels giddily, indescribably happy thinking about; mornings and evenings and nights with jungkook, jungkook filling his apartment with plants and his presence, dates yoongi may already have half-planned in his head. he hopes jungkook likes cuddling and ghibli films.</p>\n<p>he starts by pushing the stop button in the elevator, and stealing a moment, just them and whoever\u2019s in charge of the security cameras here.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>/</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cjungkook! jungkook, come here.\u201d yoongi catches jungkook by the shirt sleeve as he\u2019s walking past. jungkook mumbles about almost dropping his croissant - he\u2019s not holding a croissant but yoongi knows it\u2019s a vine reference, thank you, you miss a vine reference <em> once </em>and everyone thinks you\u2019re a gremlin who hasn\u2019t had any exposure to popular culture for the past decade - but gets down where yoongi\u2019s squatting by the coffee table.</p>\n<p>\u201cah,\u201d jungkook says, and yoongi can hear his smile as it spreads on his face, \u201cshe\u2019s finally blooming.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201ci knew we\u2019d pull through,\u201d yoongi murmurs to the primrose, touches a fingertip to the small yellow flower in a semblance of a high-five.</p>\n<p>\u201cwe?\u201d jungkook inquires. yoongi just gives his head a small shake, decides to keep his internal flora metaphors to himself for now. he feels jungkook\u2019s fingers in his hair. \u201cyou did a good job growing her.\u201d</p>\n<p>when yoongi turns, jungkook closes the distance between them, fits their mouths together so gently yoongi\u2019s chest aches with how full it is, but it\u2019s okay because instead of stinging nettles it\u2019s roses blooming fully, or - something else without thorns - what the fuck ever, that\u2019s enough flower metaphors. what he\u2019s saying is that he\u2019s happy.</p>\n<p>\u201cnot in front of the kids,\u201d yoongi mumbles when jungkook goes to deepen the kiss. feels jungkook\u2019s mouth curl into a grin, and seems like he\u2019s happy,
