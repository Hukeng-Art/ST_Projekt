  "text": "<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tim can admit he\u2019s in trouble, and this is probably exactly why Bruce insisted he not patrol solo while Bruce and Alfred were overseas. Dick\u2014Dick hasn\u2019t been in much contact since Tim was attacked at the Tower, and Tim can\u2019t even blame him. Tim is an embarrassment to the Robin mantle, and while he\u2019s grateful Bruce didn\u2019t fire him, Dick certainly wouldn\u2019t want to stick around.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Trying to prove he could be a worthy Robin has ended up with him bound and gagged, kneeling on the floor, listening to two men argue over the best way to sell him and his secret identity. He can\u2019t slip the handcuffs, not with a gun held to his head. Apparently, they\u2019ve dealt with the Bats before and are aware of their ability to slip out of almost anything. And\u2014Tim wiggles his fingers, trying to keep feeling in them\u2014he\u2019s not sure he\u2019d be able to slip handcuffs this tight anyways. If his hands were free, he\u2019d still have to pick the chains cuffing him to the floor after.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>An auction seems to be their best idea, and Tim wonders if that will buy enough time for anyone to get to the Cave and see his emergency alert.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>When a door slams open, and Hood strides in like he owns the warehouse, Tim goes deathly still. Maybe Hood won\u2019t notice\u2014</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI hear you have a bird for sale.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Or maybe Hood is here specifically for him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tim swallows, and flexes his fingers, real fear running through him. Being sold in an auction in the future was nebulous, a fuzzy <em>maybe. </em>He had plans to slip away during transit, plans to bribe them himself if money was all they wanted.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Hood might just shoot him right here, money be damned.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s not for sale <em>yet,\u201d </em>argues one of the men, and the rest shift away from him. Tim doesn\u2019t blame them; arguing with Hood is asking to be shot.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Just like wearing Hood\u2019s old colors.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cJust name your price,\u201d says the mechanized voice that Tim can never forget.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He tries to take a deep breath through his nose, ignoring the gag. He tries to pretend this isn\u2019t happening. Maybe they\u2019ll refuse to sell him to Hood, wanting to drive the price up at the auction, and maybe\u2014</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat do you even want him for? If you\u2019re just gonna shoot \u2018im, we wanna sell him to someone else. The little brat\u2014\u201d someone kicks him and Tim grunts, \u201c\u2014needs to pay for fuckin\u2019 with us for so long.\u201d The rest of the men shift even further away from the speaker, but still look to Hood for an answer.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tim can probably handle more pain. He survived the Tower, and Hood had every opportunity to kill him, but he didn\u2019t, so maybe he doesn\u2019t just want to kill Tim. Tim handle pain, even if takes days before\u2014\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s good for more than just shooting,\u201d Hood says, with an edge to his voice that makes Tim blood run cold. The men standing around laugh, and Tim shudders.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>No. No, Hood wouldn\u2019t do that. He only kills more gang members than rapists because gang members keep getting in his way. He hunts down the rapists personally.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>But then again, Hood has never hurt a child or an innocent, and most people would consider a fifteen year old wearing Robin\u2019s colors to qualify. So, Tim has always been the exception.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou want us to believe <em>you</em> want Robin for that?\u201d asks the man with a death wish, who hasn\u2019t seemed to notice how everyone keeps edging away from him. It\u2019s possible they\u2019re not unaware that they\u2019re trafficking a child, and that Hood might just be letting them wrap the noose around their own necks.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tim doesn\u2019t think Hood is doing that. Hood could have shot them all as soon as he walked into the building, or even before. Hood is here for him, and apparently he\u2019s not going to be shy about what he wants.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Even if Hood lets him go, everyone\u2014everyone will <em>know,</em> and they\u2019ll always remind him of it.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Horror rushes through him, and he closes his eyes, telling himself it\u2019s not to keep the tears back. He just needs to clear his head. Hood isn\u2019t going to do this. This is some sort of a ruse. He wants intel from these men. But Tim\u2019s heart is racing, and his throat is tight, and he doesn\u2019t know what to believe.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He has vivid memories of Hood hurting him, again and again, in the Tower. They don\u2019t inspire confidence in Hood\u2019s goodwill, and Tim can feel small shivers running through his body.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Hood and the men are still talking, but Tim is carefully tuning it out. Hood will or won\u2019t buy him. His knees hurt from being on the floor so long, and his hands twist uselessly in the handcuffs; he\u2019s helpless. It doesn\u2019t matter what they say.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>All of a sudden, someone is ripping the gag out of his mouth, harsh and painful, and Tim looks up to see Hood right in front of him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat do you say, Robin? You going to come with me?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHood\u2014\u201d Tim says, and stops.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Hood\u2019s body stays relaxed. \u201cHere\u2019s what's going to happen, Robin. These nice men here are going to unchain your legs, and you\u2019re going to stand up and come with me, and not make any trouble.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tim stares at him. <em>Are you delusional?</em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy would I do that?\u201d he asks, voice hoarse.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t think you want to piss me off any more. I can be gentle, if you give me the right incentive.\u201d The men around them laugh, again, and Tim swallows hard.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Moment of truth. Be daring, be brave, be <em>Robin.</em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cEveryone knows you don\u2019t like rapists, Hood. Not sure you\u2019re going to make good on that threat.\u201d It might be more convincing if his voice wasn\u2019t trembling.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Hood crouches down, still relaxed, and Tim manages not to flinch away. He looks right at Tim, and Tim stares back at that expressionless helmet, not daring to breathe.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Between one blink and the next, Hood pulls out a gun and cracks it across his face. Before Tim can process what just happened, before the pain has even registered, Hood grabs his head and shoves the gun in his mouth.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The metal is cold, and his teeth click against the barrel. There\u2019s a bitter taste and a little voice says <em>gunpowder, </em>but most of his brain is reeling with the fact that there is a <em>gun</em> in his mouth.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Hood pistol-whipped him and put a gun <em>in his mouth.</em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tim looks up at him, shocked and terrified, pain radiating from his cheek, as Hood calmly says, \u201cSweetheart, don\u2019t fucking push me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tim should fight back. That\u2019s what Robin would do, and he wants to be Robin, but he keeps showing over and over again that he <em>isn\u2019t</em> Robin. And there\u2019s a gun is his mouth, and he knows what else Hood wants to put in his mouth and\u2014</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He swallows around the gun, all his carefully constructed bravado bleeding out of him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Hood says, \u201cGood,\u201d with such blatant satisfaction is his voice that Tim knows he can\u2019t ever be Robin again. Not after this. Not after\u2014\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The men are laughing again, and Hood says, \u201cA bitch needs to know his place,\u201d and Tim shudders as Hood draws the gun back out of his mouth. \u201cYou know your place, sweetheart?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Looking at the ground, trying to hide the tears springing up in his eyes, he nods. He doesn\u2019t trust his voice not to crack, not to start begging, and he knows he\u2019s likely to beg before it\u2019s over, but maybe he can hold out until they\u2019re alone, at least.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a click, and the cuffs fall off his legs. This would\u2014this would be the chance to try to run, to try to kick, to do <em>something,</em> but there\u2019s an echo of metal in his mouth, he\u2019s trying not to cry, and he\u2019s almost frozen with terror. He can\u2019t even look up.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Hood rises to his feet and says, \u201cGet up,\u201d and Tim does so without hesitation, fear of disobeying overwhelming him. It\u2019s already going to be awful and if\u2014would Hood really make it <em>worse?</em> Tim wants\u2014it would be better\u2014Hood said he would be gentle, if Tim\u2014so he will. Tim will\u2014he swallows, painful with a tight throat. Tim will know his place.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tim doesn\u2019t look up, even as one of the men says, \u201cYou need a leash for that bitch, Hood? It might still give you trouble.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>A gloved hand grabs his chin, and a thumb digs into the tender bruise forming on his cheek. He whimpers, but makes himself hold still and not resist as Hood forces his head up. Tim looks at Hood through blurred vision, lips trembling, cheek aching, and Hood lets his head fall back down with a bark of laughter.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNot this one. Not as much fire as you might expect, for one of them.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>When Hood takes a step forward, Tim follows him, trembling all over. Maybe\u2014maybe Hood will leave him alive when he\u2019s done, dump him on the streets, or\u2014or maybe Tim will survive long enough for his rescue beacon to be noticed and tracked. Maybe there\u2019ll be a miracle, and Dick will stop by the Cave.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Maybe all they\u2019ll find at the end of that beacon is a body.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tim follows Jason all the way out of the warehouse to his motorcycle. The kid can\u2019t hang on with his hands cuffed behind his back, and Jason isn\u2019t sure who\u2019s still watching, so he draws his gun before he uncuffs him. Tim is unsettlingly still; Jason wonders if they drugged him, because the kid didn\u2019t roll over half this easy in the Tower.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>But he gets on the motorcycle, still wordless, and Jason can take him back to a safehouse and smuggle him back to the Bats. Give him another week, and he can take down that entire trafficking ring, and anyone who remembers Hood buying Robin will be a distant memory.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tim is rigid behind him on the motorcycle. He didn\u2019t protest getting on, didn\u2019t even protest when Jason ordered him to wrap his arms around Jason, but his entire body is stiff.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He hoped the kid was just playing along, would know Hood wouldn\u2019t <em>buy</em> a person, wouldn\u2019t <em>rape</em> anyone, no matter how fucking much he hated them. But maybe the pistol-whip and shoving the gun in his mouth was over-selling it.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason remembers what it looked like, and has to fight not to lose his dinner right then and there.\u00a0 <em>The safety was on,</em> he reminds himself, again and again, because Jason double-checked before he did it\u2014it was the fastest way he could think of to get the traffickers to back off without hurting the kid too much.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason doesn\u2019t know if he made the right choice.\u00a0 They\u2014there are more children, and he hasn\u2019t been able to find all of them, and he could\u2019ve killed every single person in that warehouse, but he would\u2019ve never found the rest of the kids.\u00a0 This is <em>Robin,</em> he would understand\u2014</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The kid starts trembling, and Jason changes his plan on the fly.\u00a0 He doesn\u2019t know where Batman is, but he\u2019s getting Tim back to the Cave.\u00a0 He can do a few reroutes to throw off any pursuers, and they won\u2019t be able to get into the tunnels anyway.\u00a0 Tim deserves to go back somewhere safe.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He still doesn\u2019t fight.\u00a0 Jason takes him through Gotham, and across the bridge into Bristol, and not a peep.\u00a0 Not a twitch.\u00a0 Not even <em>trying</em> to jump off and escape\u2014Jason is going fast, but not <em>that</em> fast.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason tries to tell himself that it\u2019s because Tim understands that it was a front.\u00a0 That if he truly thought Jason was taking him somewhere to\u2014to rape him, he would fight back.\u00a0 That the trembling kid clutching Jason is doing so because he believes Jason will protect him, not because he thinks Jason is going to hurt him worse if he tries to run.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The kid\u2019s breathing turns shallow and fast when they hit the turn-off to the Cave.\u00a0 Jason thinks he hears him whimper \u201c<em>no,\u201d </em>but he\u2019s focused on entering in the passcode\u2014they still haven\u2019t kicked him out of their system\u2014and speeding through the Cave.\u00a0 The parking is where it\u2019s always been, and Jason lets out a slow breath when he turns the engine off.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The Cave is dark.\u00a0 No Alfred, no Bruce.\u00a0 \u201cGet off,\u201d Jason nudges to the kid still clinging to him, and winces when the distorter makes it harsher than he intended.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tim shakily dismounts, stumbling forward on legs like a fawn\u2019s.\u00a0 He\u2019s shaking all over, and Jason unfreezes enough to pull off his helmet.\u00a0 \u201cTim,\u201d he says slowly, careful to keep his movements steady and his hands away from his guns.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tim turns jerkily.\u00a0 He sways, like he wants to get away from Jason, but can\u2019t move his feet.\u00a0 Jason gives him the widest berth possible as he heads deeper into the Cave.\u00a0 He checks the Batcomputer, sees that the kid <em>did</em> manage to get out an alert.\u00a0 Bruce is on his way back already.\u00a0 Nightwing is in the middle of a mission and is frantically demanding updates; he looks to be ten seconds away from torpedoing it in favor of rushing back to Gotham.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason cancels the alert and responds with an all clear.\u00a0 Pauses.\u00a0 Signs his name to it\u2014not like that\u2019ll make them panic any less, but he needs Bruce and Dick to come home as soon as possible.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>When he turns around, he sees that the kid has followed him.\u00a0 Catalogues the pallor of his skin.\u00a0 Watches the kid gracefully fold to his knees.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason doesn\u2019t move a muscle.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cPlease,\u201d Tim whispers. \u201cPlease not here.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It\u2019s a struggle not to bend over and throw up right where he is.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cTim,\u201d Jason says slowly. \u201cI\u2019m not going to hurt you.\u00a0 I\u2019m not going to touch you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The kid is shaking, violent tremors wracking his frame, and he doesn\u2019t respond.\u00a0 <em>Fuck.</em>\u00a0 He\u2019s still too pale, his breathing on the edge of hyperventilation.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason heads for the medbay\u2014the kid struggles to his feet to follow him, and Jason wants to shout <em>\u2018no\u2019 </em>but is well aware of what that sounds like.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tim stills when they draw closer to the medbay.\u00a0 The tremors ease, replaced with floaty, raspy breaths, and he climbs on a bed before Jason can say anything.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason does not want to imagine what\u2019s running through the kid\u2019s head right now.\u00a0 Unfortunately, his mind is not that considerate.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason ignores him to rifle through the cupboard containing the extra blankets, and draws out the thickest, most vibrantly colored ones he can get.\u00a0 One is a Green Lantern patterned blanket, which explains why it was at the very bottom.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Keeping his movements slow and careful\u2014he said he wasn\u2019t going to touch the kid, and he isn\u2019t going to break that\u2014Jason tugs the first blanket around Tim\u2019s shoulders.\u00a0 He can\u2019t see the kid\u2019s eyes behind the domino mask, but the confusion is palpable as Jason finishes wrapping the first blanket and gets the next.\u00a0 He\u2019s created a nice little Tim burrito by the time he\u2019s done, an owlish head poking out from the blankets.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason steps back.\u00a0 And another.\u00a0 And another, keeping his hands in easy view.\u00a0 He chooses the cot furthest from the one Tim is on, and hops up to sit on it cross-legged, tearing off his mask while he\u2019s at it.\u00a0 He considers removing his armor, but that would probably give the kid the wrong idea, so he settles for unbuckling his holsters and throwing them into the corner.\u00a0 No guns.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tim is watching him, mask tracking his movements, breaths slow and shaky.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to hurt you,\u201d Jason repeats, \u201cI\u2019m not going to touch you.\u201d\u00a0 <em>I\u2019ll kill anyone who fucking tries. </em>\u00a0\u201cEverything I said in that warehouse was a lie.\u201d\u00a0 <em>Sweetheart, don\u2019t fucking push me.</em>\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019ve been tracking the trafficking ring for a week\u2014they have more kids stashed somewhere, and the next drop is tomorrow.\u00a0 I need them alive until I can find the kids.\u00a0 I\u2019m sorry for hurting you.\u00a0 I\u2019m sorry for\u2014\u201d <em>snapping a gun across your face and shoving it in your mouth and pretending like I was the monster you clearly think I am</em>.\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Jason finishes, because he\u2019s sorry for so many things he doesn\u2019t know where to start.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em>Please stop looking at me like that.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He keeps his hands on his knees.\u00a0 He wants to leave, but he can\u2019t leave the kid alone.\u00a0 He wishes Bruce could get here faster.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Seconds tick by, and it\u2019s nearly a full minute before the kid speaks.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou hate me.\u201d\u00a0 Matter-of-fact.\u00a0 No trembling, no wavering, nothing but a blank, empty tone.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason swallows down the <em>\u2018I would never do that to anyone, even if I hated them\u2019</em> and goes for, \u201cI don\u2019t.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou do,\u201d the kid\u2019s voice is still expressionless.\u00a0 Jason really hopes he hasn\u2019t started dissociating.\u00a0 \u201cYou said so.\u00a0 When you broke into the Tower.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason winces.\u00a0 Not exactly his proudest memory.\u00a0 He chooses his words carefully, aware that what he needs to say and what the kid needs to hear right now are not the same thing.\u00a0 \u201cI don\u2019t hate you,\u201d Jason says quietly, \u201cAnd I\u2019m sorry that I attacked you.\u201d\u00a0 He has so much else to say, so much about Bruce and his jealousy and taking out his rage on a convenient target, but that explanation isn\u2019t for a kid who\u2019s climbed past terror and gone straight to surrender.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tim takes a deep breath and shudders through it.\u00a0 \u201cHood\u2019s not a rapist,\u201d he says, quietly enough that he\u2019s mostly saying it to himself.\u00a0 Jason can feel his stomach clench.\u00a0 On the next breath, Tim relaxes more into his little blanket mound, slumping until the edge of the blankets comes up to his nose.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He said a similar thing back in that warehouse.\u00a0 Before Jason shoved a gun in his mouth and insinuated that Tim was the exception.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason stays where he is, stomach roiling, and breathes out slowly.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The blankets are warm.\u00a0 It\u2019s nice.\u00a0 It\u2019s nice enough to draw Tim out of the floating haze he sank into when he saw the beds, especially since Hood is sitting far away from him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The Green Lantern blanket is on top, an eye-catching shade of neon green.\u00a0 It\u2019s buried at the bottom of the cupboard, so Hood would\u2019ve had to go searching for it.\u00a0 Tim asked Dick about it once, teasing at Bruce\u2019s infamous dislike of Hal, but Dick\u2019s answering smile had been slightly strained.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><em>\u201cIt was Jason\u2019s favorite blanket.\u00a0 Not</em>\u2014<em>not the one he liked to use, but the one he loved wrapping Bruce in whenever he was injured enough to stay in the medbay.\u201d</em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>And now Tim is bundled up in it.\u00a0 Staring at Hood.\u00a0 Staring at <em>Jason\u2014</em>vivid green eyes are tracking his movements, but the gaze isn\u2019t as...predatory as Tim remembers.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tim swallows.\u00a0 He can still taste gunpowder.\u00a0 But Jason threw the guns in the corner\u2014close by, Jason just has to get off the bed and walk six steps, except Jason isn\u2019t getting off the bed.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cI need them alive until I can find the kids.\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It makes sense.\u00a0 It makes more sense than Hood suddenly abandoning all his ideals and choosing to do business with child traffickers.\u00a0 It makes <em>sense, </em>and some part of Tim uncurled in relief when Jason explained.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He still can\u2019t stop shivering.\u00a0 Because\u2014because Jason isn\u2019t going to hurt him.\u00a0 Jason\u2014Jason <em>said </em>it, multiple times, and Tim can\u2019t\u2014his helmet is off, his mask is off, and Tim can\u2019t help but believe the Robin he followed for so many years.\u00a0 Because Jason isn\u2019t going to hurt him, but it doesn\u2019t even matter anymore.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tim won\u2019t be Robin for much longer.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The thought is acutely painful, and some of it must show on his face because Jason frowns.\u00a0 \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d he asks, his voice still quiet, nowhere near the harsh growl or vicious snarl or mocking condescension.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tim shakes his head.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAre\u2014are you hurt?\u201d Jason asks, \u201cDo you need something?\u00a0 Bruce will be here in half an hour, I think\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Tim croaks out.\u00a0 He <em>saw</em> Jason cancel the alert and give them an all-clear.\u00a0 Why would Bruce come back?</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason looks startled.\u00a0 \u201cHe\u2019s on his way back?\u00a0 Judging by the speed he\u2019s going, he should be back in a half-hour,\u201d Jason says slowly, still looking confused.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tim goes still.\u00a0 Why would Bruce come back, unless it\u2019s to strip Robin away from him <em>immediately?</em>\u00a0 He can feel his whole face begin to prickle again, and he draws his knees up under the blankets and hunches down.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He\u2014he <em>knows</em> he\u2019s not good enough to be Robin.\u00a0 Jason made that very clear in Titans Tower, and Bruce\u2019s smothering and Dick\u2019s distance afterwards just hammered in the lesson.\u00a0 And now he got captured and Jason had to rescue him and Tim didn\u2019t even realize that the older boy was putting on a facade for the traffickers.\u00a0 He\u2019s failed at being Robin many times over, and he knows he doesn\u2019t deserve to keep the suit\u2014Jason\u2019s back, Bruce has his son back, Tim\u2019s real purpose has ended\u2014but the prospect of losing it still <em>hurts.</em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tim can\u2019t quite strangle the sob, and Jason\u2019s voice echoes after it, \u201cTim?\u00a0 Are you okay?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><em>No</em>, he\u2019s <em>not</em>, and Tim can\u2019t even blame someone else for it, he\u2019s weak and pathetic and\u2014and\u2014</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cTim?\u201d Jason really sounds worried now.\u00a0 Because Tim can\u2019t even accept his fate, he has to cry\u2014in front of <em>Jason\u2014</em>and make him concerned.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cS\u2014sorry,\u201d Tim forces out, not looking at the older boy, \u201cI just\u2014I know Bruce will t\u2014take away <em>R</em>\u2014<em>Robin, </em>I\u2019m just\u2014I don\u2019t\u2014I know I won\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Jason cuts him off, \u201cWhy do you think Bruce is going to take away Robin?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cB\u2014because I messed up,\u201d Tim\u2019s voice cracks, \u201cB\u2014because I w\u2014wasn\u2019t supposed to g\u2014go out, and then I got c\u2014captured, and then\u2014\u201d he chokes on the inhale and suppresses the sob clawing at his throat. \u201cAnd now he\u2019s\u2014he\u2019s coming here and\u2014and it\u2019s a\u2014all my <em>f</em>\u2014<em>fault</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not your fault,\u201d Jason says, but Tim can tell it\u2019s a rote answer.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cH\u2014he won\u2019t t\u2014trust me and I\u2019m\u2014I\u2019m not good enough and I f\u2014failed and got c\u2014caught\u2014\u201d and all of a sudden, Tim realizes who he\u2019s speaking to.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He peers out from the edge of his blankets.\u00a0 Jason\u2019s expression is blank.\u00a0 \u201cKid,\u201d he says, a trace of wryness to the otherwise weary tone, \u201cYou haven\u2019t died yet, which is more than I could manage.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason holds up a hand, and Tim falls silent.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re clever.\u00a0 You see patterns that others don\u2019t.\u00a0 You\u2019re pretty fucking dangerous with that staff in your hands.\u00a0 If Bruce fires you, he\u2019s making a mistake.\u201d\u00a0 Jason\u2019s tone is nothing but sincere, and Tim feels fresh tears prickling at his eyes.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cT\u2014thank you.\u201d\u00a0 This is not how Tim saw this night going, with Tim wrapped up in a Green Lantern blanket as his predecessor tries to reassure him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason nods solemnly, like he understands.\u00a0 And\u2014and maybe he does, because he was where Tim was, except Jason never got rescued.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason\u2019s eyes sharpen as another shiver wracks through Tim.\u00a0 \u201cDo you want some tea?\u201d he asks quietly, \u201cI can\u2014I can make some, if you\u2019d like.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tim considers the offer.\u00a0 It would be nice to have something warm.\u00a0 And if Jason doesn\u2019t\u2014doesn\u2019t put the helmet back on, or the guns, then Tim thinks he can\u2014can remember that Jason wasn\u2019t trying to hurt him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It still <em>hurt, </em>as his throbbing cheek can attest, but Tim understands.\u00a0 Jason is trying to save a whole bunch of kids.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Tim acquiesces.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cGreat,\u201d Jason hops off the bed, and Tim stays perfectly still as Jason heads for the door.\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019ll head up to the Manor,\u201d Jason says slowly. \u201cYou can come up when you\u2019re ready.\u201d\u00a0 Tim blinks, and watches Jason head for the stairs.\u00a0 His guns are still in the corner.\u00a0 Jason goes up the stairs without looking back, and Tim slowly, <em>slowly</em> uncurls.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>His hands are stiff and his mask is digging into his cheekbone and he feels tired and sore and achy.\u00a0 He can\u2019t manage a shower, tension prickles down his spine at the thought, and Tim eventually just changes into a long-sleeved shirt and sweatpants.\u00a0 And grabs a Superboy hoodie to throw over it, surrounding himself in warmth.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>When he gets to the kitchen, he sees that Jason has stashed his armor and gear somewhere, because he\u2019s barefoot, still in the cargo pants, but wearing a thin black shirt with the sleeves rolled up to his elbow, no leather jacket.\u00a0 Jason glances up at him as he enters, but doesn\u2019t say anything, squinting intently at the cup of sugar he\u2019s measuring.\u00a0 Ingredients litter the kitchen counter and, after a brief hesitation, Tim chooses a stool on the counter opposite Jason.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The kettle is on the stove, and two mugs are next to it.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat are you making?\u201d Tim asks softly.\u00a0 He can see flour and cinnamon and eggs and vanilla extract.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason takes the hand mixer and checks to make sure it\u2019s plugged in before he turns it on.\u00a0 \u201cSnickerdoodles,\u201d Jason says, mixing together what looks like butter and sugar.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tim watches him\u2014he\u2019s never seen this side of Jason and with the helmet off, he looks like the nineteen-year-old he is, instead of the drug lord that haunts Tim\u2019s nightmares.\u00a0 He looks like a <em>kid,</em> flour-dusted hands passing Tim a mug of steaming honey-lemon tea before returning to the dough.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tim curls his hands around the mug and feels it warm him, inside and out.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He looks like\u2014almost like\u2014like the brother that Tim never got.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The honey-lemon taste replaces the gunpowder, and watching Jason knead the sticky dough with the scent of cinnamon rising in the air, he can almost forget the way that hand curled around a gun.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason curses when he realizes he forgot to preheat the oven, and the annoyed grumbling doesn\u2019t sound <em>angry. </em>\u00a0Tim has only ever gotten two emotions out of Hood\u2014anger or glee\u2014and seeing the spectrum is...soothing.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cI don\u2019t hate you.\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>And Tim can almost believe it.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tim takes another sip of tea and almost chokes on it when Batman appears in the doorway like a wraith\u2014Tim didn\u2019t hear a thing, he just blinked, and there he was.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason hears Tim\u2019s spluttering and looks up in the middle of scooping cookie dough into round balls.\u00a0 He doesn\u2019t quite freeze, but every line of his body goes tense.\u00a0 For a long, stretching moment, all three of them stare at each other.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Then Jason pointedly looks away, turning back to the cookies.\u00a0 His shoulders are still taut, but Tim is distracted by Batman swooping in, gauntleted arms reached out to catch Tim\u2019s shoulders.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cTim,\u201d comes the voice, not quite the growl, not quite Bruce\u2019s normal tone, \u201cAre you hurt?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Well, Tim has no doubt he\u2019ll have an impressive array of bruises tomorrow morning, but he shakes his head.\u00a0 \u201cJason rescued me,\u201d he says quietly\u2014and the enormity of that hits him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Hood got him away from the traffickers, took him to the Cave, wrapped him in blankets, and made him <em>tea </em>and <em>cookies.</em> Tim wouldn\u2019t have believed anyone who told him that this was going to happen, and he can understand the disbelief radiating out from Batman.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason still doesn\u2019t look up, glaring at the cookies as he says casually, \u201cTim thinks you\u2019re going to fire him.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tim stills.\u00a0 The hands on his shoulders tighten.\u00a0 Okay, so maybe Jason is still an asshole.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cTim,\u201d and this time it\u2019s Bruce\u2019s soft tone. \u201cWhy would you think that?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tim swallows.\u00a0 He doesn\u2019t glare at Jason, because there\u2019s no point to it.\u00a0 He stares at his tea and lets the warmth seep through his fingers.\u00a0 \u201cI went out on patrol,\u201d he says quietly, \u201cAnd I got captured.\u00a0 I\u2014I\u2019m sorry, I know I\u2019m\u2014I\u2019m not\u2014I\u2019m <em>trying</em> to do better, Bruce, I <em>am\u2014\u201d</em> it\u2019s just not good enough, it\u2019s never been good enough, and Tim wasn\u2019t good enough for his parents and he\u2019s certainly not good enough for Bruce Wayne.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The warm grip turns into a hug, and Tim is sobbing into the armor.\u00a0 \u201cOh, sweetheart,\u201d Bruce says softly. \u201cYou\u2019re doing great.\u00a0 I\u2019m not going to send you away.\u00a0 You\u2019re my <em>son.\u201d</em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cBut I\u2014but Robin\u2014I didn\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cTim, you will be my son regardless of Robin,\u201d Bruce says\u2014he draws slightly away, and Tim is met with warm blue eyes.\u00a0 \u201cDick doesn\u2019t need to be Robin to be my son.\u00a0 Jason doesn\u2019t need to be Robin to be my son.\u201d\u00a0 The parchment paper crinkles, accompanied by a low, choked sound.\u00a0 \u201cI love you, no matter what.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tim is\u2014Bruce is saying\u2014but he can\u2019t\u2014is Bruce really saying\u2014 \u201cNo matter what?\u201d Tim asks shakily.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNo matter what,\u201d Bruce vows, and Tim presses forward for another hug.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNo matter what,\u201d Jason says, his tone cold and\u2014and <em>angry\u2014</em>and desperately hopeful all at once.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNo matter what, Jay,\u201d Bruce repeats.\u00a0 Tim raises his head enough to see that Bruce has extended a hand to Jason in wordless invitation.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason gives Tim a glance and clearly hesitates, so Tim wriggles until he can extend a hand too.\u00a0 Jason takes a deep breath and lets it out slowly before he rounds the counter.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason smells like gunpowder.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>But he also smells like cinnamon and honey-lemon.\u00a0 Like home.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason cleans the mixing bowl and the mixer, trying to ignore the weight of the stare on his back as Dick munches through the leftover cookies.\u00a0 Bruce went to put Tim to bed, so Dick is clearly on babysitting duty.\u00a0 Watching Jason to make sure he isn\u2019t up to something.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cJason doesn\u2019t need to be Robin to be my son.\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t mean that.\u00a0 He\u2014he can\u2019t mean that.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSo,\u201d Dick says, and Jason tenses.\u00a0 \u201cYou rescued Tim?\u201d\u00a0 The tone is polite.\u00a0 Perfectly disguising the skepticism that\u2019s definitely lurking underneath.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Understandable skepticism.\u00a0 The last time Jason and Tim were in the same place, Jason left the kid with several broken bones.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Jason replies hoarsely.\u00a0 He waits for the rest of the interrogation, but there\u2019s nothing but silence.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThese are good cookies,\u201d Dick says after another lull, and Jason pauses drying to look at him.\u00a0 There\u2019s only one cookie left and Dick is eyeing it like he isn\u2019t sure whether to be polite and save it for someone else, or to just scarf it down.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThanks,\u201d Jason says, and turns back to the sink.\u00a0 He can feel Dick\u2019s stare as an itch between his shoulder blades, and, eventually, he can\u2019t stand it.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI had to pretend to buy him,\u201d Jason says.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry?\u201d Dick asks.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason swallows, and turns back around.\u00a0 He forces himself to meet Dick Grayson\u2019s assessing gaze, blue eyes intense and searching.\u00a0 \u201cI had to pretend to buy him,\u201d Jason repeats. \u201cFrom the traffickers.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Dick doesn\u2019t say anything.\u00a0 Just waits, patient.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI said,\u201d Jason swallows, because he doesn\u2019t even remember exactly <em>what</em> he said, but he remembers how it felt, how every word tasted like bile.\u00a0 \u201cI said some\u2014some horrible things.\u00a0 About what\u2014what I was going to do to him.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Dick is still calm.\u00a0 Like this is four years ago, like Jason is still Robin and confessing to his older, wiser, more experienced brother.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>But this isn\u2019t four years ago, and Dick hasn\u2019t been through what Jason\u2019s been through.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI pistol whipped him,\u201d Jason says flatly. \u201cAnd then I shoved the gun into his mouth.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>That causes blue eyes to narrow as Dick goes very, very still.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason turns away because\u2014because he can\u2019t\u2014he doesn\u2019t\u2014he can still see Tim swallowing past the gun, skin pale in terror, and he doesn\u2019t realize his fingers are trembling until he clutches the counter.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIt was the quickest way out of there,\u201d Jason says, and he\u2019s aware that it sounds like an excuse, but it was, it was the first thing that Jason thought of that could get them out without any trouble and now he\u2019s wondering how many other ways were there, how many ways he could\u2019ve talked his way out without insinuating that he was\u2014that he was going to rape the kid\u2014his little brother.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Dick says, and Jason doesn\u2019t understand.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He can\u2019t turn around, he can\u2019t face Dick, all he can do is croak out a hoarse, \u201cWhat?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Dick repeats, \u201cIf you say it was the quickest way out, I believe you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason\u2019s fingers keep trembling, because he can\u2019t\u2014because Dick wasn\u2019t <em>there\u2014</em>he didn\u2019t have to listen to the jeers and lewd suggestions and terrifying threats aimed at the small, huddled form kneeling on the ground\u2014because he didn\u2019t have to look at an expression not completely covered by the mask and know that he sold his performance so well that <em>everyone</em> had bought it\u2014he didn\u2019t have to listen to them <em>laugh</em> as he kept his attention focused on the gun, on keeping his finger far, far away from the trigger even though he triple-checked that the safety was on\u2014</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2014he thought\u2014\u201d Jason is distantly aware that he\u2019s breathing too fast, arms shaking under the strain of keeping him upright\u2014 \u201cI didn\u2019t\u2014he was\u2014he was <em>terrified\u2014\u201d</em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason is dimly aware of the sharp, shooting pains in his knees.\u00a0 He blinks, and he\u2019s staring at the drawers, hands clutching the counter above his head.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cJason,\u201d Dick says, closer now, and all Jason can do is press his face against the wood.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHe thought I was going to hurt him,\u201d Jason says, hollow and raw.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, Little Wing,\u201d Dick sighs, and Jason doesn\u2019t fight the grip that tugs him away from the drawers, doesn\u2019t fight the arms around his shoulder or the fingers in his hair.\u00a0 He buries his face in his older brother\u2019s shirt and lets the sobs claw their way out.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSometimes,\u201d Dick says softly. \u201cWe have to act in a certain way or say certain things in the middle of a dangerous situation.\u00a0 When doing the wrong thing means someone gets hurt, or worse.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI could\u2019ve killed them,\u201d Jason says hoarsely.\u00a0 Dick\u2019s fingers don\u2019t stutter in their strokes.\u00a0 \u201cI could\u2019ve killed everyone in that warehouse and walked out without saying a word to Robin.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Dick hums.\u00a0 \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThey\u2014they\u2019re holding a group of children somewhere and I don\u2019t\u2014I need more time to find out and\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd if you killed them, they would\u2019ve gone to ground,\u201d Dick finishes. \u201cYou made a choice from the options available to you, Jaybird, and that\u2019s all we can do.\u201d\u00a0 The fingers card gently through his hair.\u00a0 \u201cThis is why we have reports and debriefs.\u00a0 So when the situation is over, we can take a breath and explain ourselves.\u00a0 Did you tell Tim why you did what you did?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jason nods against Dick\u2019s shoulder.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cGood,\u201d Dick says softly, \u201cNext, I suggest you ask him if he\u2019s okay with you doing it again, if needed, or if he prefers you chose a different option.\u201d\u00a0 Jason shudders at the thought of doing that <em>again</em>\u2014he\u2019ll kill anyone who puts him in that situation again, and he\u2019ll make it <em>slow</em>.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSometimes you have to make the best of a set of bad choices,\u201d Dick hums, and there\u2019s a soft press against his forehead. \u201cAs long as everyone comes home, Jaybird.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em>As long as everyone comes home.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>"
