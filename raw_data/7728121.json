  "summary": "<p>Ellie Potter\u2019s introduction to the magical world is a little more complicated than intended. No one, not even Dumbledore, expected the Girl-Who-Lived to Awaken as a sentinel. Which just goes to show you how little wizards understand Sentinels \u2013 nothing like being thrust into a new world, filled with dangers and enemies to Awaken a sentinel\u2019s instincts.</p>\n<p>Goblins have little use for wizards, but sentinels and guides are another matter entirely. Sentinels are warriors; ruthless, fierce, and without mercy on the battlefield. The kind of being a Goblin can respect. So when the Girl-Who-Lived comes into the bank, Awakening\u2026well. There\u2019s little they could do to aid an underaged witch without a magical guardian. A Sentinel? Anyone who tries to interfere in affairs between Sentinels and Guides and the Horde courts war.</p>\n<p>Ellie leaves Gringotts with far more than she might have. The goblins send send her off, already plotting. Change is coming. A storm is building. There will be profit and battle in the coming days.</p>",
  "notes": "<p>Notes: Magical Sentinels and Guides. A Primer.</p>\n<p>Purebloods have no idea what to do with Sentinels and Guides. They are obviously powerful and show up in magical families. Great! They show up even more in muggleborns and, worse, muggles. And muggle Sentinels are a match for even a strong magical Sentinel. Bad! Also, Goblins like them. Obviously, this is a bad thing. Also, this Guide thing\u2026they aren\u2019t real because that would mean we have to let our pureblooded children breed with anyone they claim is their Guide even if that guide is. . . muggleborn. So Guides aren\u2019t really real.</p>\n<p>Also, Goblins like them.</p>\n<p>Oh, and the Horde has separate treaties with the Sentinel and Guide communities, including the muggle ones, because hiding magic from Sentinels\u2026didn\u2019t work so well.</p>\n<p>So, Ellie is a latent sentinel, up until the moment she walks into the Leaky Cauldron, surrounded by strangers who think they know her, who touch her \u2014 and shakes the hand of Quirrel. Who, you know, is consorting with the man who murdered her family. That would Wake a dormant Sentinel, much less a latent child of a powerful Sentinel and Guide.</p>\n<p>The Goblins can see her Awakening. And meddle. A lot.</p>\n<p class=\"jump\">(See the end of the work for <a href=\"#work_endnotes\">more notes</a>.)</p>\n<p>Originally written/posted for the July 2016 Little Black Dress Challenge at Rough Trade.</p>\n<p>There may one day be more in this work, but I have a lot on the go right now so please don't hold your breath; it could be months if not years.</p>\n<p>Also, for anyone who is curious about the use of 'wix' and 'wixen': these are gender neutral terms for wizard or witch. Also, wixen can be used in place of magical -- as in the Wixen World. These terms emerged from tumblr and LGBTQ+ Harry Potter communities like magicqueers (tumblr). I identify as queer (asexual, thanks for asking) so I adopted the terms and am hoping to infect AO3. Also, wixen is way less unwieldy than writing 'wizards and witches' all the damn time.</p>\n<p>For more details, check out: http://themonsterblogofmonsters.tumblr.com/post/83083297985/what-is-a-wix</p>\n<p>Thanks!</p>",

And killed multiple characters. In <em>children\u2019s</em> books). Seriously, canon-typical warnings in Harry Potter fandom covers pretty much everything <em>except</em> rape. Of which there is none in this story, though there will be some purely intellectual discussion of the unique threats girls might face.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\n<img src=\"https://darkseraphina.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/senses-of-magic-cast.jpg?w=840\" alt width=\"750\" height=\"1125\">\n</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em>Part One</em>\n</p>\n<p>Ellie Potter still wasn\u2019t sure if she was going to wake up in the cupboard under the stairs in the house at Privet Drive. Dreams didn\u2019t usually last this long, but Ellie was used to only having nice things happen in dreams.</p>\n<p>It wasn\u2019t <em>all</em> nice, though; Hagrid was brilliant, especially the way he\u2019d given Daisy a tail, and magic was <em>amazing</em>. But now she knew that the Dursleys had lied to her all her life \u2014 which was a little good as well, since it meant everything they told her about her parents was also a lie \u2014 and the way people had reacted in the pub. . . Ellie shuddered at the memory of being crowded and touched by excited strangers. Absently, she scratched her arm. Someone must have been wearing strong perfume, like last year when her substitute teacher\u2019s scent had made her itchy and headachey.</p>\n<p>Unless you could be allergic to <em>magic</em>. Could Ellie\u2019s luck be that terrible?</p>\n<p>\u201cAlright, there, Ellie?\u201d Hagrid asked.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, of course. Where are we going?\u201d</p>\n<p>The huge man pointed. \u201cThere: Gringotts, the wizard bank. No finer place to keep yer gold and treasures.\u201d</p>\n<p>Still scratching, Ellie followed him to the huge, crooked marble building. Didn\u2019t anyone in Diagon Alley own a ruler? Or did magic make everything go wibbly-wobbly?</p>\n<p>The carving on the door was interesting, and between in and the vicious weapons held by the goblin guards, Ellie hardly needed Hagrid to tell her that goblins weren\u2019t terribly friendly. She decided the her best manners were the way to go with these bankers. It was just as she had this thought that everything went odd.</p>\n<p>Considering she was a real witch, that was saying something.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd does Ms Potter have her key?\u201d</p>\n<p>Hagrid began digging through his pockets and Ellie, still itching, asked, \u201cWhy do you have my key, Hagrid?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDumbledore gave it to me \u2014 it goes back to him, mind.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut. . . why?\u201d</p>\n<p>The goblin\u2019s teeth bared. \u201cYes, Mr Hagrid, why <em>does </em>Albus Dumbledore have the key to a vault that isn\u2019t his? And why has he ignored all attempts by the Potter Account Manager to contact him in regards to the accounts in question?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI have an account manager?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIndeed.\u201d Ellie noticed that the goblin was eyeing the way she was scratching her arm and stopped, worried he might think it was rude.</p>\n<p>\u201cHere it is \u2014 slipped to the bottom.\u201d</p>\n<p>The goblin \u2014 Ellie looked for a nametag and found none \u2014 took the tiny golden key and examined it minutely. \u201cVery well. Griphook will escort you to vault 713 and I will escort the Lady Potter to her account manager.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHere, now, Professor Dumbledore told me \u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDumbledore has no say in the banking business of a family not his own, or a child who has no magical guardian.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe Headmaster <em>is</em> Ellie\u2019s guardian.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe is not. His own actions have prevented <em>anyone</em> from taking guardianship of Lady Potter. Since she is now able to carry a wand, she may also assume limited control of her accounts and title \u2014 unless there is a magical guardian. There is not. Griphook.\u201d</p>\n<p>None of the goblins paid any attention to Hagrid\u2019s sputtering. In short order, Ellie found herself drawn along a stone hallway lined with intimidating bronze doors. \u201cAm I really Lady Potter?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLady Eleanor Potter, Viscountess Glamorgan; yes, you are.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh.\u201d That was. . . how was she supposed to deal with that? Surely viscountesses didn\u2019t live in cupboards. Magic was brilliant, but it also seemed very complicated.</p>\n<p>Her escort stopped at one of the bronze doors \u2014 this one studded with gleaming stones that surely couldn\u2019t be diamonds \u2014 and entered. The goblin behind the huge expansive desk was taller and fiercer than the first, and looked up with a frown. The following conversation was spoken in a language Ellie didn\u2019t know.</p>\n<p>Finally, the seated goblin nodded sharply. \u201cVery well; Ironfist, retrieve Grimjaw and Stonefist; both the Potter and Black account managers have a dragon in this fight.\u201d He eyed Ellie as the first goblin left, leaving her alone and nervous.</p>\n<p>\u201cHello, sir.\u201d</p>\n<p>He came around from his desk. \u201cHello, child. I am Ragnok, Director of Gringotts Bank and Chieftain of the Goblin Horde.\u201d Long clawed fingers caught her wrist, pushing up her sleeve and revealing her red and raw arm. \u201cWhen did this start?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUm, I think at the Leaky Cauldron. It\u2019ll go away in a while; it did the last time.\u201d She bit her lip. \u201cChieftain. Is that like a king?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cA comparison could be drawn.\u201d He drew one finger down her arm, speaking in that growling language again. Ellie gasped as the burning itch vanished and the rash began to fade.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh! Thank you!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou are welcome, child. Have a seat.\u201d</p>\n<p>She did, puzzled. \u201cExcuse me, sir. Hagrid said that goblins aren\u2019t very friendly, but \u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>This earned one of those toothy smiles. \u201cWe are not particularly friendly to wizards, true. However, you are different.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBecause I\u2019m a witch?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, child. Because you are a sentinel.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\n<img src=\"https://darkseraphina.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/square-goblin.jpg?w=334&amp;h=334&amp;crop=1\" alt width=\"300\" height=\"300\">\n<img src=\"https://darkseraphina.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/gringotts.jpg?w=498&amp;h=334&amp;crop=1\" alt width=\"447\" height=\"300\">\n</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u00a0</p>\n<p>An hour later, Ellie\u2019s head was still spinning. On her finger, she wore a gold ring set with an engraved ruby, bearing the Potter crest. On her wrist was a slim gold cuff, etched with gold runes and inlaid with a platinum winged sword. At her throat was a new golden key on a delicate chain. In her hand was a small wooden chest with a stained glass lid, which she clutched tightly.</p>\n<p>Her mind was wild with questions and too much information, but Ragnok was kindly giving her time to adjust by taking his time pouring tea. The goblin healer who had been by had snarled and shouted so fiercely after examining her that the goblin king had immediately sent for a meal.</p>\n<p>Stonefist, the Black Account Manager, muttered viciously in Gobbledygook as he went over the account books; furious over the discovery that the family solicitors, who had been making decisions for the absent Lord Black, had been taking gold from several family members to act against the best interests of their Lord. There was something else going on there, Ellie knew, but the goblins had been careful to avoid the identity of Lord Black and his connection to her. Ragnok assured her that when he had made further inquiries, she would know the whole of it. Since all evidence pointed to the goblins being the most honest adults Ellie had ever met, she was content with that.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo, what now?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNow, you will purchase that which you need for school. A team of warders have gone to Privet Drive; their work will insure that no one may harm you there, including the Dursleys,\u201d he sneered the name. \u201cIt is only temporary, as Grimjaw\u2019s priority will be finding a suitable guardian and unsealing your parent\u2019s will by legal means.\u201d</p>\n<p>That was infuriating; her parents had made arrangements, and someone had not only disregarded them, but blocked their will from being executed. Not even Grimjaw knew the full contents.</p>\n<p>\u201cBy Yule, we shall have answers in regards to the irregularities uncovered. Someone will check on you frequently,\u201d Ragnok assured her. \u201cNow that we have reworked the mail ward placed on you, Gringotts may communicate easily with you, and you may do the same. The Sentinel Ward,\u201d he pointed to her bracelet, \u201cwill protect you from spikes and zones as you Awaken.\u201d</p>\n<p>And wasn\u2019t that a shock; Ellie only knew as much about sentinels as they taught in schools, and the Dursleys had objected even to that. No surprise that they would hate sentinels and guides since they despised anything not normal. It surely hadn\u2019t helped that Lily, her mother, had been a guide and her father a sentinel.</p>\n<p>Her hand tightened around the little chest. It was full of pretty hair pins and delicate earrings, necklaces and rings. Her father had started collecting them for her when she was born, a tradition for the parents of pureblood witches. Unlike many family jewels, these were hers entirely, no matter whether she married or whom. The box had been tucked in the Family Reliquary along with the Glamorgan ring and several other treasures that passed along from the Head to their heir.</p>\n<p>The little box was proof her father had loved her.</p>\n<p>Ellie hid her threatening tears in her teacup. Kindly, none of the goblins commented.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou remember how to charge purchases directly to your account,\u201d Grimjaw asked roughly. He was a stern goblin and seemed a little baffled at dealing with a child. Several times he had looked to his leader when Ellie had become upset.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, I use my key and press an imprint in the wax seal.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd you are comfortable using the bracelet store?\u201d</p>\n<p>She lifted her wrist, making the gold cuff gleam. It already contained many of the things she\u2019d found in the Lord\u2019s Reliquary, including an invisibility cloak, the family seal, and the master grimoire. Other things, like the ritual knife and the keystone to the wards of all the Potter properties remained in the Reliquary until she was older. \u201cYes, sir.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou will write Grimjaw if you need anything, child,\u201d Ragnok stated. \u201cIf the bracelet is too sensitive or not sensitive enough, it can be adjusted easily. He will make an appointment with a healer for you as well; expect a visit in the next week.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThank you very much, Chieftain,\u201d she managed, desperately grateful. She had no idea what might have happened to her if she wasn\u2019t a sentinel; would anyone have told her anything useful to prepare her for Hogwarts? She already knew that Ragnok and his people wouldn\u2019t have been able to interfere as much as they had if she was just a witch; the treaties between the Horde and the Sentinel-Guide Centre, as well as the old magically binding alliances of days past gave them more freedom than British magical law.</p>\n<p>All three male goblins cleared their throats and looked awkward. Ellie hid a grin.</p>\n<p>\u201cMay your gold pile high and your enemies fear your name, Lady Potter,\u201d Ragnok smiled fiercely.</p>\n<p>\u201cMay you grow rich at the expense of those who anger you, Chieftain Ragnok.\u201d</p>\n<p>Hagrid had long completed his secret errand, but he still looked a little green when Ellie left the depths of the bank. By the time they reached Madam Malkin\u2019s, he looked worse, so she sent him off the the pub \u2014 though how beer could settle a stomach was beyond Ellie. It only seemed to make Uncle Vernon flushed and loud.</p>\n<p>Madam Malkin was with a very demanding boy, who was ordering lavishly and insisting that he did need silk-lined school robes, so the madam\u2019s niece, Anna, took Ellie into a private dressing room to measure her.</p>\n<p>The young woman frowned slightly at the state of Ellie\u2019s clothes. \u201cJust school robes today?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cActually,\u201d she began. \u201cMy account manager said I should make sure to get everything I need for Scotland in winter.\u201d Ellie paused, biting her lip. \u201cI don\u2019t have any boots, either. And,\u201d she looked at the witch\u2019s brown hair, caught up in an elegant coil, \u201care their spells for hair? Or a magic brush?\u201d She thought of her father\u2019s gift box and pushed her tangled curls away from her face.</p>\n<p>\u201cWait, Account Manager?\u201d Anna looked from her ragged hand-me-downs to the golden key around her neck, and the caught sight of her ring. \u201cI think you should start from the beginning, sweetie, while I finish measuring you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cToday is my birthday, and I just found out I\u2019m a witch.\u201d</p>\n<p>By the end, Anna was steaming, muttering choice words under her breath. Finally, she nodded sharply and snatched the measuring tape from the air. \u201cRight then, sweetie. Let\u2019s get started.\u201d</p>\n<p>The stitch witch quickly piled up school robes and warm jumpers, casual clothes for the weekend and thick tights for the cold Highland winters. There were pretty day robes in lovely colours, flannel nightdresses and two pairs of silky pyjamas; slippers and socks and three pairs of shoes, plus a pair of knee-high snow boots. To that was added two cloaks, one for autumn and spring, the other a warm grey and red wool for winter.</p>\n<p>The blonde boy watched enviously as it was all shrunk and packed. Ellie pressed her key to the bottom of the bill, feeling a little breathless at having new things and spending so much money.</p>\n<p>But they weren\u2019t done.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhere are we going?\u201d Ellie asked as the older witch drew her along the street.</p>\n<p>\u201cTo get you a brush.\u201d</p>\n<p>Madam Primpernelle\u2019s was a shock to Ellie\u2019s senses, but not in a bad way. The counters of potions and displays of beautiful bottles were nothing like the cosmetic counters at the department store; more like a witch\u2019s workroom, she thought with a smile. She sneezed only once, when passing under bundles of drying lavender, which was very different from a muggle store.</p>\n<p>\u201cIngrid,\u201d Anna called to a tall and lovely blonde witch. \u201cThis is Ellie. She needs everything.\u201d</p>\n<p>Everything was a little book of hygiene spells, a bottle of hair cleansing potion \u2014 which was both shampoo and conditioner \u2014 and self-foaming soap; a brush spelled to smooth and detangle the knottiest knots, a small bottle of Sleakeasy\u2019s Hair Potion (\u201cDon\u2019t let anyone tell you to pour it on, sweetie; a few drops on your brush every Sunday night is all you need\u201d) and a jar of honey-scented cream for her skin, all with refilling spells.</p>\n<p>Ellie asked to smell everything, which made the wix smile. Nothing bothered her nose, but she was a little worried that something might make her itch.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter, sweetie?\u201d Anna asked.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s just. . . I get rashes a lot.\u201d She toyed with her warded cuff.</p>\n<p>Both ladies had sharp eyes. \u201cIs that. . . ?\u201d Anna asked. Ingrid caught her wrist, turning it until the winged sword that marked a sentinel was visible. \u201cMorgana bless.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, I have something for rashes \u2014 don\u2019t worry, everything we picked is sentinel-safe,\u201d Ingrid told her, offering a slim bottle of green potion. \u201cJust a drop on any irritated skin; it spreads itself.\u201d</p>\n<p>It did indeed, making Ellie jump a little at the sensation. The last bit of redness that remained despite Ragnok\u2019s spell vanished. \u201cI\u2019ll take it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Everything was tucked into a plain dressing case that Ingrid assured her would serve her all through Hogwarts and likely beyond.</p>\n<p>Hagrid found them as they headed towards Flourish and Blotts. \u201cHere now, what\u2019s this?\u201d</p>\n<p>Anna huffed at the big man. \u201cThat\u2019s what I want to know, Hagrid. Why on earth wasn\u2019t Ellie given a proper muggle-born introduction? Or the full school list? Her letter only included school supplies, not a packing list.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, she ain\u2019t a muggleborn, is she?\u201d Hagrid looked baffled. \u201cAnd the headmaster told me Ellie only needed what was on her list.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe headmaster isn\u2019t an eleven year old girl going away to school for the next ten months! And he can pop off the village if he needs new socks! She would have shown up at school without winter boots and a muggle toothbrush.\u201d She frowned fiercely. \u201cI\u2019m going to tell Minerva the next time I see her.\u201d</p>\n<p>Hagrid looked flustered. \u201cWell, now, Anna, there\u2019s no need for that, surely?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThere certainly is! I\u2019m taking Ellie to get her books, and not just textbooks! She needs things to read for fun, and a book of manners, and all sorts of things. She\u2019s the head of a noble house, for Merlin\u2019s sake! What if she\u2019d accidently started a blood feud?\u201d</p>\n<p>Ellie looked back at Hagrid\u2019s flabbergasted face as Anna led her away. \u201cWho\u2019s Minerva?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cProfessor McGonagall, the Deputy Headmistress.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy does she scare Hagrid?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBecause he has common sense.\u201d</p>\n<p>The bookstore was a whirl; Anna requested the full first year package from Mr Blotts, who told Ellie she had her mother\u2019s smile. Then there was stacks of books: spellbooks and histories, a dozen novels, a magical encyclopedia and books full of moving pictures. There was two books of etiquette, one of which was dense and full of pompous words that purebloods swore by, and three different books about the magical world for muggleborns. All this and more was shrunk into brown packages with the admonishment to return anything she didn\u2019t like and send an owl if she needed more.</p>\n<p>The trips to the apothecary \u2014 ingredients and tools for potions class \u2014 and to Globeflier to buy luggage went quickly. The quill shop took a little longer, with all the choices of quills and pens and lovely inks \u2014 invisible, rainbow, colour-changing, and every colour imaginable \u2014 not to mention the endless options for parchment and writing paper. By the time Ellie had made her choices \u2014 four rolls of parchment for classes, scented stationery for letters, five different inks and twelve assorted quills, plus a pretty little case to store it all in \u2014 \u00a0she was exhausted. It had been a very long day!</p>\n<p>Anna finally lead her back to the robes shop. When they entered, the blonde boy from earlier was complaining bitterly to a beautiful woman.</p>\n<p>\u201c \u2014 and they let anyone in here, Mother, you wouldn\u2019t believe the kind of riffraff who shop here. Like that filthy mudblood they were falling all over themselves for earlier.\u201d</p>\n<p>Anna hissed and Madam Malkin\u2019s face hardened. But it was the beautiful witch who reacted.</p>\n<p>\u201cDraco Lucius Malfoy.\u201d</p>\n<p>He looked baffled by her sharp tone. \u201cMother?\u201d Then he saw Ellie. \u201cThat\u2019s her \u2014 honestly, why they let her kind in \u2014 what are you looking at, Mud \u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>He was cut off by his mother\u2019s hand covering his mouth. \u201cI\u2019m ashamed of you, Draco. How dare you use such vulgar language \u2014 in public no less.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut \u2014 Father \u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYour father may say as he likes, I cannot stop him. You are my son, and a Black. You will behave like one.\u201d She sighed. \u201cObviously I made a mistake, letting you father take over your lessons this summer. I suppose I can\u2019t expect anything else.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFather \u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cEnough.\u201d She turned to Ellie. \u201cI apologize for my son\u2019s poor language.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThank you, ma\u2019am.\u201d The witch smiled faintly, apparently pleased with her manners. \u201cExcuse me, did you say you\u2019re a Black?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, that\u2019s my maiden house.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s just, my father was related to the Blacks.\u201d</p>\n<p>Pale eyes sharpened. \u201cAnd who was your father, dear?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cJames Potter.\u201d</p>\n<p>Her gaze flickered over Ellie\u2019s clothes, then landed on her ring. \u201cI see. Welcome back, Lady Potter.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThank you, ma\u2019am.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLady Narcissa Malfoy, dear.\u201d She studied Ellie, then Anna. \u201cYou\u2019ve been taken care of properly, child?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, Lady Malfoy, Anna\u2019s been very kind.\u201d</p>\n<p>Narcissa nodded and offered Anna a small smile. \u201cI\u2019m glad to hear it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLady Malfoy, do you know anything about Lord Black?\u201d Ellie continued rapidly, despite the woman\u2019s stillness. \u201cIt\u2019s just that the goblins said he was supposed to be my guardian and that there are irregularities in how things were managed. But I don\u2019t know what things they mean.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIrregularities. I see.\u201d Lady Malfoy drew herself to her full height. \u201cLord Black is my cousin, but I have not seen him in many years. Did the goblins say anything else?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat they were going to make inquiries.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI will be sure to speak with Stonefist; I may have useful information.\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco frowned. \u201cFather said that when Lord Black dies, I\u2019ll be the new lord.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYour father is about to get a rude awakening,\u201d the lady stated, and drew her son away with the admonishment for Ellie to write her.</p>\n<p>After all of that, buying a wand was positively tame.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\n<img src=\"https://darkseraphina.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/senses-of-magic-characters-1.jpg?w=840\" alt width=\"700\" height=\"394\">\n</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u00a0</p>\n<p>Many hours later, ten goblins entered Azkaban. They were warded against the Dementors, and there were no human guards to see them either. They moved swiftly through the barren halls, ignoring the cold and the screams. Their chieftain was angry, and no one wished to earn his ire by being late.</p>\n<p>The wizards had placed a sentinel in this hell; without trial or questioning. That he was a pureblood lord would horrify the wixen public when they found out \u2014 and they would \u2014 but it was the fact that he was a sentinel that violated British and international law, and every treaty with the Horde.</p>\n<p>No one knew if Sirius Black was still sane; nor did they know if he still had his heightened senses. If he had betrayed his friend and fellow sentinel, he would have gone dormant within weeks.</p>\n<p>If he had not. . .</p>\n<p>The door was pathetically easy to open; the arrogance of wizardkind meant that they hadn\u2019t warded against anything but their own magic.</p>\n<p>Several goblins cursed. Inside the small, freezing cell was a matted and emiciated Grim. Curled around it, feathers broken and dull, a huge griffin stared at the goblin warriors, eyes full of intelligence and fury.</p>\n<p>Their chieftain was going to cut off someone\u2019s head.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em>Part Two</em>\n</p>\n<p>Ellie followed Grimjaw through the crowds of King\u2019s Cross Station. They drew little attention, due to the fact that Hedwig\u2019s cage was covered and the goblin wore an illusion ward.</p>\n<p>\u201cIs there anything wards can\u2019t be used for?\u201d she asked. Turing a fierce-looking goblin into a redheaded human dwarf was surely a feat even for magic.</p>\n<p>\u201cFor quick spells or short-term actions, wand magic is better. Wards require time and planning to cast. However,\u201d he smiled toothily, \u201cwith preparation, there is no magic more stable, powerful or long-lasting than a well-made ward.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCan only goblins make them?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, though we excel at it. Where wizards learn basic charms, we learn the skills needed to cast wards. But others learn as well. Runes, arithmancy, and cleverness are needed in warding.\u201d He guided her around a group of crying travelers. \u201cYou will be able to learn the first two at Hogwarts in a few years.\u201d</p>\n<p>Before Ellie could say anything in response, Grimjaw caught her wrist and tugged her. Through a <em>wall</em>.</p>\n<p>\u201cWha \u2014 ?\u201d she managed on the other side.</p>\n<p>\u201cBetter you did not know in advance. Hesitation draws attention and makes it difficult to pass through the ward.\u201d</p>\n<p>Ellie didn\u2019t have it in her to be upset; before her was a gleaming red steam engine, a crowd of wix in their weird and wild clothing, and dozens of children her own age and up.</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you alright, dear?\u201d</p>\n<p>A couple heading for the exit had stopped to speak to her. They wore nice muggle clothing; the lady wore glasses and had wildly curly hair and the man had bright blue eyes. He was eyeing Grimjaw sharply, as if he knew there was something odd about him. Since Ellie could <em>almost</em> see the edge of the goblin\u2019s illusion, the gold winged sword on the man\u2019s lapel didn\u2019t surprise her.</p>\n<p>\u201cSentinel.\u201d Grimjaw stated calmly, releasing his ward. The man immediately relaxed.</p>\n<p>\u201cMaster Goblin.\u201d</p>\n<p>No wonder the wixen world hadn\u2019t been able to hide from sentinels and guides; even if they couldn\u2019t see through spells, they could tell where at least some of them were. \u201cWill I be able to do that?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhen you awaken fully, yes.\u201d</p>\n<p>The lady offered her hand. \u201cI\u2019m Helena Granger, and this is Iain.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cEllie Potter.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFirst year, dear?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, ma\u2019am.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo is our daughter, Hermione.\u201d She looked from Grimjaw to Ellie. \u201cMay I ask. . .?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMy parents are gone, and my relatives aren\u2019t very comfortable around magic. Grimjaw is my account manager; he made sure I got here on time.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd now I must see Lady Potter on to the train.\u201d</p>\n<p>The Grangers still seemed a little concerned about her, and she was instructed to write to them if she had any trouble with her senses; both Drs Granger had ties to London\u2019s Sentinel-Guide Centre. Since Grimjaw seemed to find that amusing, Ellie figured that \u2018ties\u2019 actually meant someone important.</p>\n<p>Then Grimjaw escorted her to the train; her large steamer trunk and matching wardrobe trunk were unshrunk and sent to the luggage car and Ellie, Hedwig, and her traveling case were deposited in a compartment near the front of the train.</p>\n<p>The goblin hesitated, seeming reluctant to leave. \u201cYou have everything you need?\u201d</p>\n<p>She smiled at him. \u201cYes, Grimjaw. I promise I\u2019ll write if I need anything.\u201d The manager had visited her twice a week all of August; after the first visit, the Dursleys were far more afraid of him than Hagrid. There had been several conversations about her family estate, about what had happened to her family, and many questions about magical society \u2014 Ellie was now aware of just how terrible Draco\u2019s language had been.</p>\n<p>He patted her hand once then departed, leaving Ellie alone.</p>\n<p>To distract herself, she watched the crowds of parents and students on the platform. There were children of all ages, squirming in humiliation as mothers kissed them and cried; more than one last minute scolding or plea for good behaviour. Older students greeted friends and sweethearts cheerfully and younger ones pretended not to be nervous.</p>\n<p>A beautiful dark-skinned woman kissed her handsome son on the forehead; a witch with an entire vulture on her hat lectured a nervous boy. She considered going to greet Narcissa Malfoy, but the lady appeared to have her hands full with a sulking Draco and a man who could only be his father; Lady Malfoy appeared to be scolding both of them.</p>\n<p>As the train filled, a redheaded family entered the platform in a chaotic rush; the mother had her hands full with five children. The youngest, a girl, whined about wanting to go while her mother scolded a pair of twins, who soon escaped and dragged their younger brother out of the line of fire. The eldest, who seemed only a little less stuck up than Draco, assured his mother that he would keep an eye out for someone.</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what could have happened,\u201d the witch fretted. \u201cAlbus told me she would need help getting to the train, but. . .\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Mother, I\u2019ll be sure to look after her at Hogwarts. I can only imagine how much guidance she\u2019ll need, and I am a prefect. And of course I\u2019ll do my best to keep the twins out of trouble, not that they ever listen to me,\u201d he ended bitterly.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, Percy, you\u2019re a good boy.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMum, why can\u2019t I go?\u201d</p>\n<p>Ellie tuned them out at that point, instead listening to the conversations outside the compartment door.</p>\n<p>The whistle blew, and they were off to Hogwarts.</p>\n<p><br>\nNarcissa settled in the chair across from Stonefist. \u201cMay your gold and slain foes pile high, Stonefist.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMay your enemies fear your wrath and your purse overflow, Lady Malfoy.\u201d He laced his fingers. \u201cWhat may I do for a daughter of the House of Black today.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI spoke with Eleanor Potter,\u201d she told him, noting the barest flicker of his eyes. \u201cA lovely child.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cA strong one, which will serve her far better.\u201d</p>\n<p>She tilted her head. \u201cPerhaps, but so many people underestimate a beautiful woman.\u201d A lesson learned long ago. From her purse, Narcissa drew a bundle of papers and offered them. \u201cProof that Lord Malfoy has paid the law firm of Wright, Watson, and Ward significant sums over the last ten years to encourage their lack of interest in upholding their duty to Lord Black. Also included are letters between Lord Malfoy and Hieronymus Wright which detail the specifics of their arrangement.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stonefist\u2019s smile grew wider and toothier the longer she spoke. \u201cI see. I believe this will go very well with the evidence that Walburga Black has done the same.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShe would have happily bought Sirius\u2019 freedom if had truly joined the Dark Lord.\u201d She made an effort to uncurl her fists. \u201cWright is well aware that Lord Black had no trial; the barest effort on his part would have brought the matter before the World Court. Even if Sirius had been tortured or Imperiused into betraying the Potters and gone dormant as a result, sentinel law would apply.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stonefist straightened his papers. \u201cIndeed. Wright is guilty of law breaking, oath breaking and fraud, as he is under retainer and has drawn on the maximum funds permitted since the day Lord Black was sent to Azkaban. He and his firm will be dealt with in due time. However,\u201d the goblin stated calmly, \u201cLord Black is not dormant, was not tortured or cursed \u2014 and was never the actual Secret Keeper.\u201d</p>\n<p>Narcissa exhaled. \u201cA decoy. Sirius was such a Gryffindor, except when he was ruthlessly Slytherin.\u201d A thought occured. \u201cHow can you know his current status? Only Ministry officials can visit Azkaban.\u201d</p>\n<p>He grinned, and one of the walls of the office opened up. \u201cWhy visit when you can just break in?\u201d</p>\n<p><img class=\"size-full wp-image-662 alignleft\" src=\"https://darkseraphina.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/cast-sirius-black-4.jpg?w=840\" alt=\"Cast Sirius Black 4\" width=\"224\" height=\"336\" align=\"right\">\u201cAnd out,\u201d Sirius Black added.</p>\n<p>He was thin and pale and he looked ten years older than his age. Despite that, his pale eyes were bright and sharp and a smaller version of his cheerful smirk played over his mouth.</p>\n<p>\u201cDamn you, Sirius, I haven\u2019t cried in public since giving birth.\u201d</p>\n<p>The smirk became a grin. \u201cNice to see you too, Cissa.\u201d He made his way over to the seat beside her.</p>\n<p>She flicked away a tear and frowned. \u201cYou need a Healer.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBloody hell, I already have three.\u201d He pointed a finger at Stonefist. \u201cDon\u2019t get any ideas.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOur healers can undo the damage done to you, but you will need a human healer for future care. We are already looking into it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cA healer with experience with Sentinels would be best,\u201d Narcissa told Stonefist, ignoring her cousin\u2019s huff. \u201cPerhaps one from Paris; the War Mages have an office there and many magical Sentinels gravitate towards the ICW.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sirius sighed. \u201cThere are several healers with that kind of experience in Britain, but they work for the Department of Mysteries; many of the sentinels and guides that here that don\u2019t work for the bank or join the ICW end up in the \u00a0DOM.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHow do you know that?\u201d she asked, as it was news to her. \u201cI thought most worked for the Aurors?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhere the DOM recruits heavily from.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSirius. . .\u201d</p>\n<p>He smiled faintly. \u201cI wasn\u2019t an Auror, Cissa, I was a Hit Wizard.\u201d She knew that. \u201cHit Wizards don\u2019t answer to the Ministry, but the Crown; it\u2019s part of the agreements with the Crown made when we separated.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBecause they\u2019re too close to a standing military force, which we are forbidden from having except in a state of war.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cResearch is only part of the DOM\u2019s mandate; they\u2019re a body of the Crown.\u201d</p>\n<p>Her jaw dropped. \u201cWait. . . you were an Unspeakable?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTechnically, I still am. I broke no oaths and my codename was never deactivated.\u201d He looked a little bitter. \u201cI have no idea what the Minister told the DOM to get them to ignore me; they should have at least interrogated me to see if I passed on any secrets.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThey may have been shown manufactured evidence,\u201d she offered gently.</p>\n<p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d He shifted his shoulders, as if trying to shake off negative thoughts. \u201cSo Lucy thinks that if I die, his son will be the Duke of Ravensmoor.\u201d</p>\n<p>Narcissa met Stonefist\u2019s gaze. If Sirius wanted to change the subject, they would let him. \u201cHe did; he certainly knows better now.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHexed him, did you? Excellent, you were always quick on the draw.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, he hasn\u2019t begun to suffer. Stonefist, I\u2019d like to start replacing all the funds I\u2019ve used from my Trust on behalf of the House of Malfoy. I think we\u2019ll start by selling those hideous Malfoy diamonds.\u201d</p>\n<p>The goblin looked bloodthirsty, but Sirius frowned. \u201cWhy are you using your funds to float the Malfoys? And how much money are we talking about?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLucius and his father spent a fortune funding the Dark Lord\u2019s warchest, and Lucius made several very poor investments early on after the war.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe focused on blood politics instead of business models, didn\u2019t he?\u201d The sentinel shook his head. \u201cStupid. Plenty of purebloods are willing to ignore blood status when it comes to making money; grandfather and father certainly did.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIndeed. I agreed early on in our marriage to pay for our daily living expenses and Draco\u2019s needs and education, in exchange for control of both our assets and household budget.\u201d Narcissa smirked. \u201cNot that he had a choice; Lucius hasn\u2019t been able to set foot in Gringotts in ten years.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stonefist explained. \u201cLord Malfoy and several of his compatriots were arrested on charges of treason and sedition \u2014 which is exactly what being a Death Eater entailed. Minister Bagnold, in exchange for money, influence, and their support in future endeavours, dismissed the charges. They were not acquitted or found not guilty.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sirius started laughing. \u201cBleeding morons. How many did you capture before they got wise?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOnly two.\u201d He looked regretful, then smiled. \u201cBoth were tried under Crown law and executed by the Horde.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lucius had been horrified and furious to find out that the Horde considered the charges active; only the Crown \u2014 the current Regent, or a full Wizard\u2019s Council \u2014 could acquit or pardon a charge of treason. The goblins had a treaty with the Crown that required them to uphold Crown law \u2014 and to execute warrants for capital offenses.</p>\n<p>\u201cPity they got word out so quickly,\u201d Sirius mused. \u201cIs Bagnold still alive?\u201d</p>\n<p>Narcissa nodded. \u201cYes, though she retired five years ago.\u201d Stonefist looked satisfied. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShe retired because her magic began to fail; she can barely light a candle at this point.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShe betrayed her oaths to uphold the laws of Magical Britain <em>and</em> the Crown.\u201d Sirius shrugged. \u201cI\u2019m sure there are several other members of the Ministry whose magic has been decreasing. There would be more if not for power enhancement rituals. Will Lucius notice you replacing your funds from the Malfoy coffers?\u201d</p>\n<p>She abandoned her musing on Lucius\u2019s ability to cast high-level curses, but not basic charms. \u201cYes, but not for months and I have a perfect excuse; I\u2019ve always punished him by spending lavishly, and I\u2019m very put out with what he\u2019s been teaching my son.\u201d She frowned. \u201cDraco actually called someone a. . . well, you know \u2014 in <em>public</em> no less. A witch who outranked him. And he sincerely believed that it was a perfectly acceptable thing to do.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m trying to imagine what would have happened if you or I had done that \u2014 well, unless it was my mother who found out, but she was crazy.\u201d They pondered that, and shuddered. \u201cWho was it?\u201d</p>\n<p>Narcissa looked away, and Sirius huffed. \u201cIt was Ellie, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m working to correct his behaviour, cousin.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI believe you, but teach your son some manners, Cissa. I would never hurt a child, but my tolerance for such behaviour towards my girl is negligible.\u201d It wasn\u2019t her cousin, but Lord Black who made this declaration.</p>\n<p>\u201cI understand.\u201d He nodded, and the subject was dismissed. \u201cWhat next?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou could find me a new lawyer while Ragnok makes sure the Ministry is too busy to announce my escape \u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI was wondering about that,\u201d she mused.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe ICW has made it their business to investigate a number of legal irregularities of late,\u201d Stonefist smiled widely. \u201cAnd the Crown has become concerned about several new laws favouring purebloods.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c \u2014 and Grimjaw keeps Albus Dumbledore running in circles trying to claim guardianship of Ellie <em>without</em> unsealing the wills.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd <em>you</em> will be following healer\u2019s orders,\u201d she told him tartly. \u201cWhat about you, Stonefist?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI will be ensuring the attention of the Department of Mysteries.\u201d He displayed a terrible number of teeth.</p>\n<p>\u201cNever cross a goblin,\u201d Sirius murmured with a smile.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Ellie scrambled into a boat alongside Hermione, Ron, and Neville, her new friends, as they chattered away in excitement.</p>\n<p>She\u2019d met Ron first, one of the redheaded family she\u2019d been watching, when he\u2019d stumbled into her compartment with his older twin brothers. He had asked a couple of awkward questions about her scar, but they\u2019d quickly been distracted by more serious matters.</p>\n<p>\u201cYour mum seemed worried about someone earlier.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMerlin, she\u2019s been going on about something for days \u2014 you should have seen it, we must have circled the station five times! \u2014 but I don\u2019t know what about. Some favour to the Headmaster, I think.\u201d His face fell. \u201cMum doesn\u2019t tell me anything; she\u2019s been weird ever since I awakened as a guide.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, really?\u201d He\u2019d showed her a bracelet a little different from her own, with a silver winged crescent circle.</p>\n<p>\u201cBill got it from the goblins; it\u2019ll stop me from projecting if my shields fall. My control isn\u2019t perfect yet,\u201d he admitted. \u201cBill says it\u2019ll come. He\u2019s a guide too, it runs in the Weasley family. He came home from Egypt for the summer to help me. He\u2019s a cursebreaker for the goblins, but they like guides and sentinels so they weren\u2019t upset. I think he got special training while he was here.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDoes you mum not like guides?\u201d Some people just didn\u2019t.</p>\n<p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t really understand them; Mum\u2019s a Prewitt, and they\u2019ve never had a sentinel or a guide.\u201d</p>\n<p>Neville and Hermione had been next, while searching for Neville\u2019s toad.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, I met your parents at the station. They\u2019re very nice.\u201d Ellie turned to Ron, who was eyeing Hermione like an alien lifeform. \u201cHer mum and dad are a sentinel-guide pair.\u201d The redhead had perked up, and a conversation swiftly ensued.</p>\n<p>\u201cWait, how can you not believe in guides?\u201d Ellie demanded. \u201cI\u2019ve heard of people not liking them \u2014 my relatives hate anything they think isn\u2019t normal \u2014 but to not <em>believe </em>in them?\u201d</p>\n<p>Neville, who was her godbrother since his mum was her godmother, and her dad had been his godfather, had shrugged. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t make any sense, of course, and it\u2019s only a handful of pureblood families. Mostly it\u2019s because, if you accept the sentinel-guide bond, you have to let pairs marry and even reproduce regardless of bloodlines. Since it\u2019s impossible to deny that sentinels exist, they ignore guides.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat, and there are more muggleborn and half-blood sentinels and guides than pureblooded ones,\u201d Ron added. \u201cAnd there are some people who are empaths without being guides, so they just claim it\u2019s a magical gift.\u201d</p>\n<p>Hermione frowned. \u201cGuides are a scientific fact! And if it\u2019s a magical gift, then why are there thirty million guides in the muggle world?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo one said it made sense,\u201d Neville offered.</p>\n<p>Hagrid set the boats in motion and they laughed and clung to the sides. In a nearby boat, Draco sulked. He\u2019d shown up in their compartment with a pair of thugs that reminded her of Daisy and her friends, trying to make trouble. Ellie had called him \u2018cousin\u2019 and asked after his mother, then told Hermione to remind her to write to Lady Malfoy. The blonde boy had fled with a scowl.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019ll see Hogwarts in minute,\u201d Hagrid said. \u201cThere we are.\u201d</p>\n<p>Ellie gasped, the sound lost among all the others. Against a twilight sky full of stars, a fairytale castle lit with golden light rose before them. The Highlands rose behind it, and the lake they were crossing glimmered with reflected light.</p>\n<p>\u201cBeautiful, ain\u2019t it?\u201d</p>\n<p>Hermione caught Ellie\u2019s hand and squeezed. \u201cYeah.\u201d They watched the castle come closer, excited and apprehensive. \u201cBeautiful.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\n<img src=\"https://darkseraphina.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/concept-art-dermot-power.jpg?w=840\" alt width=\"849\" height=\"361\">\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Part Three</em>\n</p>\n<p>Ellie swallowed the last of her eggs while sorting her mail. She broke the seal on a letter from Gringotts as Draco\u2019s voice drifted from the Slytherin table.</p>\n<p>\u201cMy Father says that there\u2019s nothing to this business of guides,\u201d he drawled, oblivious to the dirty looks he received from all over the hall. \u201cHe says that it\u2019s just muggleborns and<em>some</em> families trying to make themselves important.\u201d</p>\n<p>Ellie and Hermione both snagged Ron\u2019s robe, preventing him from rising.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe Malfoys would know all about trying to look important,\u201d a Ravenclaw prefect said loudly. Draco flushed red and opened his mouth.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sure Lady Malfoy had something to say about that, seeing as the Black family has produced both sentinels and guides since the time of Arthur.\u201d Ellie smirked at Draco\u2019s scowl.</p>\n<p>Zabini smacked the blonde\u2019s head. \u201cOw! Blaise!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFor the love of Morgana, Draco \u2014 stop antagonizing Potter. She outranks you and has your mother as a quill friend. Also, the last fight you started with her cost you ten points and got her a place on the Quidditch team.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThank you, Malfoy,\u201d the Weasley twins chimed in. \u201cYou saved us \u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c \u2014 from holding tryouts.\u201d</p>\n<p>Ellie hid a grin as Malfoy sulked into his oatmeal. Ron didn\u2019t bother being discreet.</p>\n<p>Grimjaw\u2019s letter informed her that \u2018attempts to resolve her guardianship were progressing\u2019. There was also a name for her to contact; Remus Lupin was an old friend of her parents and the beneficiary of an unknown bequest in their wills. Also, apparently she now owned a small share in the chocolate frog company. Ellie grinned and wondered if it was possible to own a broom company. She decided to ask in her next letter.</p>\n<p>\u201cCome on Ron, or we\u2019ll be late for Potions,\u201d Hermione scolded.</p>\n<p>Ellie rose to follow her friends. \u201cWhat a tragedy.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, Ellie, I know you have trouble in Potions.\u201d Hermione squeezed her hand. \u201cWhen is your bracelet getting an adjustment?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThis weekend; Grimjaw is coming with Healer Royal.\u201d</p>\n<p>The muggleborn frowned at the mention of Ellie\u2019s healer. The first time Pen Royal had shown up at Hogwarts, after the first week of classes, several uncomfortable conversation had resulted. Madam Pomfrey and Healer Royal had fought viciously over the mediwitch\u2019s right to know about Ellie\u2019s healthcare regime. Professor McGonagall had fed her tea and shortbread cookies, asked to see her school letter, and stalked off the shout at the Headmaster.</p>\n<p>Hermione had wheedled the details out of Ellie, late at night in their dorm. When she found out that Ellie was being treated for long term malnutrition, the other witch had ranted and raved and cried, all while proclaiming that Ellie was coming home with her. There had been threats and promises to tell the London pride and only the assurance that the goblin Horde would put the Dursleys heads on pikes before letting her return had settled her. \u00a0</p>\n<p><br>\nSeverus watched over the Slytherin/Gryffindor first years with a scowl. There was no more volatile classroom pairing than this one; he cursed Albus once more for his constant insistence that exposure would reduce the rivalry between the two houses.</p>\n<p>Though the look on Minerva\u2019s face whenever he stated that piece of idiocy was priceless.</p>\n<p>He stalked between the divided houses; several attempts to sabotage Gryffindor potions were aborted.</p>\n<p>The potions master scowled at the cluster of Gryffindors at the back; Potter\u2019s spawn and the muggleborn Granger had their heads together while Weasley \u2014 another one, honestly, Molly Weasley was perfectly capable of brewing a contraceptive potion \u2014 and that menace Longbottom struggled with a potion already two shades too dark.</p>\n<p>Granger was a know-it-all, but she could follow directions, and Potter was far less useless than either boy. Severus would have preferred to pair them off with one strong brewer at each bench, but Granger was uncharacteristically disobedient when it came to working with Potter, and Weasley was<em> more</em> distracted when working with her.</p>\n<p>He started to call the brat out for her laziness, letting Granger do all the work while she sat and stared, when something about Potter\u2019s posture stirred his memory. Severus was a bastard who would spend his life repenting for the arrogance and foolishness of his adolescence \u2014 but he wasn\u2019t stupid.</p>\n<p>The girl jerked when Granger touched her wrist; Weasley and Longbottom half-turned, checking on them until they were waved off.</p>\n<p>His glower darkened. Foolish little <em>idiots</em>.</p>\n<p>\u201cPotter, stay behind,\u201d he drawled when she brought the finished potion vial. The Gryffindors frowned at him while the Slytherins laughed.</p>\n<p>Severus closed the door firmly on the hovering trio in the doorway. \u201cYou foolish child; what kind of idiot comes to potions, week after week, and doesn\u2019t say anything about being a <em>sentinel</em>?\u201d</p>\n<p>Ten minutes later, he stalked into Minerva\u2019s office; the older witch followed him, leaving her NEWTs class taking notes. \u201cSeverus?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI have two sentinels in my class that I didn\u2019t know about!\u201d he hissed. \u201cGranger and Potter \u2014 for Merlin\u2019s sake, Minerva, do you realize how dangerous that is?\u201d He stalked along the room. \u201cHow many others are there? Do any of the other teachers know? Sentinels come online slowly \u2014 it\u2019s entirely possible to zone before you even know you\u2019ve come online. Even <em>Astronomy</em> class could cause a zone in a sentinel with sight issues!\u201d</p>\n<p>Minerva\u2019s face was tight. \u201cAlbus didn\u2019t tell you?\u201d</p>\n<p>Oh for fuck\u2019s sake. Severus pinched the bridge of his nose. \u201cAlbus?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI told him about Ms Granger right away \u2014 her parents are a pair, and she\u2019s a registered latent. I didn\u2019t know about Ms Potter until she came to school wearing a ward, but I mentioned it to him. He was supposed to tell the staff and ensure that the wards on Gryffindor Tower were updated.\u201d She frowned. \u201cI don\u2019t want those girls up half the night because of drunken louts in Hogsmeade.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, I doubt that\u2019s been done, either,\u201d he snapped.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat man,\u201d she huffed. \u201cHe\u2019s never seemed to understand sentinels and guides. As if I don\u2019t have enough to worry about with that bloody stone,\u201d Minerva muttered.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe have another problem.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCan it wait until after dinner, so I can have a dram?\u201d</p>\n<p>He almost smiled. \u201cUnfortunately not. Potter\u2019s senses spike in Quirrell\u2019s presence. Worse? The day she started to awaken? Was also the day she went to Diagon Alley.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNot terrible surprising, a portion of our society is a direct threat to her.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShe also met Quirrell that day.\u201d He watched as she calmly drew her wand and shattered a vase. \u201cHis presence gives Potter headaches, and her senses increase after each class.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGranger?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo reaction.\u201d That was both a relief and a worry. If Quirrell was a threat to eleven year old girls in general, Granger would surely be awakening. However, it meant that the wizard was a threat to Potter specifically.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo he\u2019s potentially a Dark Wizard instead of a paedophile. What a bleeding relief!\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\n<img src=\"https://darkseraphina.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/senses-of-magic-characters-2.png?w=840\" alt width=\"700\" height=\"394\">\n</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u00a0</p>\n<p>The wizard known only as Silence followed a goblin into the depths of Gringotts.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis seems unlikely, Silence.\u201d Amelia Bones murmured.</p>\n<p>\u201cIf you can think of another explanations for Black\u2019s escape, the complete lack of sightings, and now the removal of every one of his belongings from DoM storage and the DMLE evidence vault \u2014 all without a trace of a magical signature \u2014 I would like to hear it, Bones.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s a dark wizard,\u201d Bode, one of his Unspeakables muttered. \u201cThat explains everything.\u201d</p>\n<p>Silence sighed. What a pity that he needed public faces for the DoM to hide it\u2019s deeper purposeses. Bode made a good decoy, and he was a reasonable if uncreative researcher, but he was far too straightforward for the more esoteric research or intelligence work of the department.</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t be an idiot, Bode; dark magic is easy to detect, if difficult to undo,\u201d Bones snapped. \u201cBut why on Earth would the Horde break a Death Eater out of Azkaban \u2014 much less steal his belongings?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat is exactly what I wish to discover,\u201d the Head Unspeakable \u2014 and commander of MI4 \u2014 replied.</p>\n<p>The goblin Chieftain smiled toothily when they entered. \u201cGood profit and war, wixen.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd to you, Ragnok.\u201d</p>\n<p>They \u00a0declined tea and sat. \u201cWhat can the Horde do for the Ministry today?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you harbouring Sirius Black?\u201d Bones looked horrified by his blunt question, but Ragnok chortled.</p>\n<p>\u201cHarbouring implies guilt.\u201d He leaned back in his seat, black eyes gleaming. \u201cThe Horde<em>rescued</em> Lord Sirius Black from his illegal detainment, as was permitted by our treaties with the ICW and the Sentinel-Guide community. Incidentally,\u201d he spoke over Bode\u2019s attempted outrage, \u201cthe Ministry will be sanctioned for the violation of international sentinel law and its treaties with the British Crown.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Silence and Bones demanded.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou sent a sentinel to Azkaban without a trial!\u201d the goblin roared. \u201cViolating the Magna Carta \u2014 one of the foundational documents of the agreement to separate magical and muggle society! Sirius Black is a member of the Wizard\u2019s Council \u2014 his ancestors helped<em>found</em> the Council \u2014 and that makes him an agent of the Crown\u2019s rule over Magical Britain!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe betrayed Lily and James!\u201d Amelia declared. \u201cHe was going to go dormant!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIf that were true, he was still required to have a trial <em>and</em> be assessed by the ICW or the Sentinel-Guide Centre. That kind of betrayal is unheard of in a sentinel and surely indicated magical coercion!\u201d Ragnok bared his teeth. \u201cHow many people claimed<em> Imperius</em>and weren\u2019t even assessed by healers \u2014 despite Crown warrants for treason? The one man who seemed likeliest to be under that spell wasn\u2019t even <em>asked</em>!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cStop,\u201d Silence interrupted the building fight between goblin, Auror and Unspeakable. \u201cSirius <em>confessed</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe did nothing of the kind! He wasn\u2019t even questioned!\u201d</p>\n<p>The head Unspeakable leaned back, thinking rapidly. He waved off Bode, who tried to interject. \u201cThis is why the ICW has been so stirred up lately. I thought I recognized the hand of the Horde in their recent inquests.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe Ministry\u2019s current troubles are only a prelude as evidence is gathered. The Queen is tempted to overturn the entire government, and if the ICW finds too many complicent, Britain may lose its seat entirely. And the International Council of Sentinel-Guide Affairs hasn\u2019t even found out yet,\u201d he added viciously.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh goddess,\u201d Bones groaned.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe have a bigger problem.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBigger than sanctions at every possible level?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDamn it, Amelia! I know you demanded the documents on Black\u2019s arrest and trial \u2014 so did Moody. Don\u2019t you remember?\u201d</p>\n<p>Slowly, the DMLE Head paled. \u201cBloody buggering fuck.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d the Chieftain demanded.</p>\n<p>\u201cI insisted on seeing everything \u2014 Sirius was one of mine.\u201d He sighed, remembering the grief, denial and fury. \u201cHe was brilliant, dangerous, and <em>loyal</em>. The bond between Sirius and James was fierce. They awakened within minutes of each other.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe attack on Hogsmeade their fifth year,\u201d Amelia recalled. \u201cThey awakened, went berserk \u2014 they even took their lycanthrope friend, Lupin with them \u2014 and tore a swath through the attacking Death Eaters.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cExactly. It made so little <em>sense</em>, so I checked everything. There was a stack of evidence, a confession, and a healer\u2019s report that Black\u2019s senses were already reduced. There was also a declaration of imprisonment,\u201d Silence added. \u201cBearing a Crown Seal.\u201d</p>\n<p>Ragnok snarled in Gobbledygook, leapt from his seat, and started shouting.Bode cowered as goblin warriors poured into the room.</p>\n<p>\u201cDid you see this?\u201d Ragnok demanded of Bones.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes. Moody did as well \u2014 he refused to believe that Black would betray James.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe Queen did not place that seal \u2014 she has already overturned all charges against Lord Black.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhich means someone in the Office of the Minister has access to the Crown Seal \u2014 or a forgery that can pass inspection.\u201d Silence was <em>furious</em> at that violation of the law. \u201cBagnold and Crouch\u2019s signatures were on most of the documents \u2014 along with Fudge, who was the first on scene.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd soon after that, Fudge found a patron in Lucius Malfoy,\u201d Amelia hissed. \u201cMalfoy has been trying to get the Ravensmoor seat ever since.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe Wizard\u2019s Council hasn\u2019t been able to exercise veto powers since Sirius\u2019 imprisonment,\u201d Silence pointed out, working through Bagnold and Crouch\u2019s motives. \u201cThe other members of the Council have a lot of power in the Wizengamot, but all twelve seats of the Council must be filled to act as ruling body. Without an heir, the House of Black\u2019s seat has remained empty \u2014 despite Malfoy\u2019s attempts.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThey knew he might be innocent, and sent him to Azkaban anyway, to increase the Ministry\u2019s power,\u201d Silence fumed.</p>\n<p>\u201cAided by the money from Malfoy and a handful of others, who all hoped to inherit if he were to die in prison,\u201d Ragnok added.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, fuck.\u201d</p>\n<p><br>\n\u201cWait \u2014 where\u2019s Ellie?\u201d</p>\n<p>Ron and Neville paused in their ascent of the staircase. \u201cShe didn\u2019t want to come to the feast; you know that, Hermione,\u201d Neville offered.</p>\n<p>\u201cExactly! There\u2019s a troll in the school! <em>Where\u2019s Ellie?</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>The froze, immediately being pushed out of the way by panicking students. \u201cWouldn\u2019t she be in the dorm, Hermione?\u201d Ron asked. \u201cShe burrows in when she\u2019s upset.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, but when she wants to think, she goes up high,\u201d Neville worried. \u201cLike the Astronomy Tower.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShe likes to be away from the noise of the school so she can relax and practice extending her hearing,\u201d Hermione explained. \u201cYou know she hates being crowded.\u201d</p>\n<p>They did know; the three Gryffindors had learned very quickly that Ellie would shrink in on herself, hiding behind her hair or her collar if other students started trying to get close. The invasive questions and whispers and stares of the first weeks of school had made all three of her friends very protective of their youngest member, often forming a physical barrier or even telling off the insistent. It had cost them, as it left all four of them fairly isolated amongst their peers and House; several students had even tried to tell them off for \u2018hogging\u2019 the Girl-Who-Lived. <em>That</em> had not gone over well; Neville was surprisingly capable of shaming people for poor manners, Hermione could scold like McGonagall on a tear, and Ron had the sharp tongue and insults of a child with six siblings.</p>\n<p>\u201cIf she\u2019s not in the dorm. . .\u201d Neville whispered.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe have to find her!\u201d Ron hissed.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe need to tell a teacher!\u201d Hermione snapped.</p>\n<p>But there were no teachers anywhere in sight; only harried Prefects. The first they found was carrying two first years, and obviously no help. The second was Percy.</p>\n<p>\u201cPercy! We need help!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHonestly, Ron, I cannot deal with you now \u2014 this is an emergency, and the staff are counting on we Prefects \u2014 you, there, move along! Quickly now, there\u2019s a troll about!\u201d He scolded a group of students. \u201cGo on, Ron, back to the dorm.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut Ellie \u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHer?\u201d Percy sniffed. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t want my help!\u201d Since Percy had spent two weeks constantly trying to get Ellie to accept his overbearing advice on everything from finding her way to class, to what she should eat at breakfast \u2014 and been soundly rebuffed \u2014 he was nursing wounded feelings. Or at least a damaged ego. \u201cGo to the dorms, now.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut we don\u2019t \u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll take points from each of you! I won\u2019t let being your brother to interfere in my duty!\u201d</p>\n<p>They stormed off, and ducked away from the other students once around the corner.</p>\n<p>\u201cI told you he\u2019s a prat!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFine, apparently not everyone with a badge is a font of wisdom,\u201d Hermione conceded huffily. \u201cNow what?\u201d</p>\n<p>Neville rocked on his heels. \u201cIf she\u2019s in the dorm, she\u2019s safe. If she isn\u2019t there, she <em>has </em>to be in the tower, right?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThen,\u201d he inhaled, \u201cwe should go straight there to check.\u201d</p>\n<p>Ron looked at him admiringly and breathed, \u201cNeville.\u201d Hermione looked horrified.</p>\n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing for it; if we go looking for a teacher, we might run into the troll. The Tower has narrow stairs; a troll won\u2019t fit up there, so once we get there, we\u2019ll be safe.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd if they expel us for it?\u201d Hermione asked pertly.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe blame Percy,\u201d Ron grumbled.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><br>\nEllie was tucked up under her cloak \u2014 the lovely gray and red one that Anna had picked for her \u2014 and pondered that this was the best Halloween she could remember. Even though she now knew it was the anniversary of her parent\u2019s deaths.</p>\n<p>At Privet Drive, she spent the night in the cupboard. Any day that involved candy was one Daisy demanded to take part in, and Petunia didn\u2019t want to risk Ellie sneaking even a single treat from the dish given to trick-or-treaters.</p>\n<p>There had been a few stares today, but most people seemed to forget the exact date she became the Girl-Who-Lived. Still, Ellie had not been able to bear feasting and celebrating today. Her friends had understood.</p>\n<p>Not only her school friends; she had a stack of letters in her hand, all thick and full of sympathy, stories, cheer and information.</p>\n<p>Anna\u2019s letter came with a pair of gloves and a tiny bottle of scent \u2014 her family was Irish, and apparently many of the old Celtic families still acknowledged the old calendar which marked Samhain as the end of the year. The scent, picked by Ingrid for her, smelled of apple blossoms and was a traditional gift for the new year.</p>\n<p>Remus, who she had been writing to for several weeks, had sent a long letter full of stories of her parents while at school. Pranks and arguments and names like \u2018Lily-flower\u2019 and \u2018toerag\u2019 made her giggle and shed a few tears for the people she would never know. Even better was the stack of moving photographs; Ellie now knew she had her father\u2019s hair and her mother\u2019s eyes.</p>\n<p>But Grimjaw\u2019s was the best, if only barely.</p>\n<p>The older students had spent a week talking about the events in the paper recently; the arrest of the current Minister of Magic and his two predecessors, as well as several other members of the Ministry had been all over the news. The staff had been solemn, and Dumbledore had missed several evening meals. She and her friends hadn\u2019t paid much attention, since it had nothing to do with them. Apparently this was wrong and it had a lot to do with Ellie.</p>\n<p>She unfolded the last letter, included in the packet from Gringotts.</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u2014 so sorry I wasn\u2019t there for you, Ellie. I never meant for this to happen; James and I both believed in the system to protect you. I would have never went after Peter if I had known where Dumbledore was taking you \u2014 I thought you would be safe at Hogwarts until I finished.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>There were a lot of reasons that I was sent to Azkaban, including some we haven\u2019t pieced together yet. Many are political, and I\u2019ll explain in detail later. Both our families are old and respected Houses, and with that power can come resentment.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>The goblins have been taking very good care of me, since I must be healthy to take care of you. I was wretchedly thin and weak before; I think I spent most of the last ten years in a zone. Azkaban is not kind to Sentinels. Only my spirit guide and animal instinct ensured I ate and drank enough to survive. The healers are terrifying \u2014 I know you have one of your own, but there\u2019s no one like a goblin healer to make sure you take your potions!</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>I hope to see you at winter break, unless you prefer to stay at Hogwarts; the Goblin\u2019s have helped me clean and renovate my family homes, including removing the pests. . . particularly my mother \u2014</em>\n</p>\n<p>She had a godfather, and he wanted her.</p>\n<p>Ellie folded the letter, tied all of them together with string and tucked them in her pocket as she rose. The feast was surely over by now.</p>\n<p>From the depths of the castle, she heard a scream.</p>\n<p><br>\nEllie woke slowly to the sound of breathing, the quiet throb of familiar heartbeats, and voices.</p>\n<p>\u201c \u2014 absolutely <em>mad</em>! If I knew anything about such a potion \u2014 which I <em>don\u2019t</em> \u2014 I would never brew it! I would <em>obliviate</em> myself of the recipe!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSeverus \u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou may believe that you are immune from repercussions, but I know better! If sentinels and guides knew that a potion existed which would prevent them from awakening or repress their abilities they would destroy our society, Albus! The vast majority of them are muggles, and the only reason that our separation was possible is because they aided us in hiding by <em>not</em> revealing us! Five hundred years of mutual support \u2014 they let us hide, we help them escape by our means if their societies or governments turn on them \u2014 all undone if you managed what you just suggested! For the love of Merlin, she\u2019s wearing a goblin ward!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhich neither you nor Minerva informed me of.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt was none of your business! The ward stops her from sudden spikes or zones, but it also protects her and connects her to the master ward in Gringotts \u2014 a protective measure for all under age sentinels and guides. Even awakened, she\u2019ll continue to wear it for years. Are you trying to start a war with the Horde?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI hardly think \u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat is obvious!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSeverus.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c1659 \u2014 a pureblood suppressed his guide daughter so that he could proceed with the marriage he\u2019d arranged for her and not have to return the bride price \u2014 the Horde impaled him, <em>alive</em>, in front of the bank along with the potions master who brewed the potion. Every adult in the family who knew what he planned was imprisoned and the Horde spent a decade purging all knowledge of the potion. And no one stopped them because the moron who started the whole thing <em>nearly caused a Goblin Rebellion</em>!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt is too dangerous for her to be a sentinel, Severus. It draws attention \u2014 not to mention the ire of the pureblood families \u2014 and makes it difficult to guide her properly.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt is the greatest defense she has against those who would move against her. She began coming online the day she entered the magical world \u2014 because it is dangerous. Muggleborns awaken so often because simply being Muggleborn in our world is inherently dangerous. James Potter was a sentinel, Albus, surely you realized this was a possibility from the beginning?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI did not consider it likely.\u201d A sigh. \u201cWell, if you will not \u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, and do not ever ask or even speak of it again!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c \u2014 then the next best thing will be to make sure the Weasley\u2019s are made her guardians. I have had no luck in doing so \u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFor good reason, you did overturn the will, supercede the law, act as her guardian without consent, and ignored her accountant.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c \u2014 but it is perfectly reasonable to see a Sentinel placed in family with active guides. Perhaps young Ron and Ellie will be a good match \u2014 Molly will like that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIf they were, we would already know.\u201d</p>\n<p>The voices faded as Dumbledore and Professor Snape moved away. Ellie waited before she sat up.</p>\n<p>She was in the Infirmary, and she wasn\u2019t alone. Hermione was curled up beside her, while Neville lay on the bed to the left. Ron was in a chair by the bed, slumped over her and Hermione\u2019s legs. Each one of them sat up when she did, awake and having heard the conversation.</p>\n<p>Hermione was tearful and angry. \u201cThat \u2014 its \u2014 how \u2014<em>what</em>?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBloody hell, Snape is the good guy,\u201d Ron breathed.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, how<em> could</em> he?\u201d Hermione managed. \u201cHow could he even think it, much less ask?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s insane,\u201d Neville whispered. \u201cSnape is right \u2014 it could start a war, or end the Secret.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOnly Ellie,\u201d the redhead muttered. \u201cHe didn\u2019t say anything about Hermione.\u201d</p>\n<p>Ellie turned to her friend. \u201cHermione?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not online \u2014 awake,\u201d she corrected, \u201cbut when the troll came, I started to. I can visualize my dials already, and that\u2019s something you\u2019ve only been able to for a few days.\u201d She frowned. \u201cIt happened so quickly that I didn\u2019t awaken fully before \u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d she asked. \u201cI don\u2019t remember much.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou \u2014\u201d Neville shook his head. \u201cYou were <em>berserk</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFeral,\u201d Hermione translated. \u201cYou\u2019ll probably remember over the next few days. There was a troll in the school, and they sent us back to the dorms \u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWait, why not lock the doors of the hall?\u201d</p>\n<p>They all looked surprised. \u201cI \u2014 didn\u2019t think of that,\u201d Hermione mused. \u201cWell, that was stupid.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo one thought of it, including the teachers.\u201d Neville sighed.</p>\n<p>\u201cRight, well, we tried to tell someone you weren\u2019t there \u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>Ellie made a face when Ron growled, \u201cPercy.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c \u2014 but he wouldn\u2019t listen. So we went to find you and. . .\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe troll found us.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI screamed.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBlimey, so did I.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBetter than me \u2014 I squeaked.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe tried to get out of it\u2019s way, and I. . . well I could hear it move.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDragged us out of the path of the club, she did.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd then. . . you came.\u201d Hermione hugged her. \u201cYou came and saved us.\u201d</p>\n<p>Ron and Neville nodded. \u201cNo one\u2019s gonna cross you, Ellie; you dropped a mountain troll with a <em>levitating</em> spell.\u201d</p>\n<p>Ellie grinned, then toyed with her bracelet. She could feel her senses straining against an invisible boundary; the ward was intelligent, and had lightened it\u2019s protection in the face of a threat that required her full senses, but now it tried to keep her from reaching too far and hurting herself. Despite the ward, her senses were far stronger than even this morning.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat do we do?\u201d Their headmaster couldn\u2019t be trusted. \u201cNo offence, Ron, but \u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>He made a face. \u201cUgh, no. I like you Ellie, but not like <em>that</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>Hermione shook her head. \u201cEven without being completely awakened \u2014 which you and Ellie are \u2014 we would know if any of us were a match. A platonic bond would have already formed.\u201d She frowned fiercely. \u201cHe\u2019s a brilliant wizard and an <em>educator</em>! He should have a better understanding of sentinels and guides!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cEllie should write to Gringotts.\u201d Neville looked up. \u201cWe need help, and goblin\u2019s have a lot of authority with magical sentinels.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m going to write to Bill,\u201d Ron decided. \u201cHe can help \u2014 even if it\u2019s just with Mum. Does anyone have parchment?\u201d</p>\n<p>They wound up stealing paper and quills from Madam Pomfrey\u2019s desk. Hermione looked confused when Ellie handed some to her. \u201cI\u2019m sure your parents want to know your coming online.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut they can\u2019t do anything.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, but they should still know. Or do you want to get of the train and have that be the first thing they notice?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh.\u201d She took the parchment and began to write, huffing at Ron, who muttered that she was brilliant, but a little slow.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\n<img src=\"https://darkseraphina.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/senses-of-magic-characters-4.jpg?w=840\" alt width=\"747\" height=\"420\">\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Part Four</em>\n</p>\n<p>Bill refolded his little brother\u2019s letter as he waited outside the Chieftain of the Horde\u2019s office. It wasn\u2019t the first he\u2019d received from Ron since school began, but it was the most shocking. In fact, Bill had dropped what he was doing in the Paris Branch \u2014 training in the use of the new ward breakers \u2014 taken a priority portkey to London, and presented himself with a guide emergency.</p>\n<p>Now he was waiting.</p>\n<p>The jewel-studded door swung open, and an armoured goblin beckoned him inside. Bill entered and went to address the highest-ranking goblin on earth, when that being\u2019s attire gave him pause.</p>\n<p>The Chieftain wasn\u2019t an elected title, or a even a hereditary position, but one won in battle. Without a war or rebellion to prove themselves in, goblins fought in a gladiator-style tournament once every two hundred and one years. Despite that, Ragnok most often wore an elaborate version of the bank uniform; to see him dressed for war was. . . worrying. Especially considering Ron\u2019s letter.</p>\n<p>\u201cWilliam Arthur Weasley; son of Arthur of the line of Weasley, son of Molly of the line of Prewett. Guide, cursebreaker, mastery of arithmancy, Gringotts employee for four years and seven months.\u201d Ragnok slid a battle axe into a holster on his back. \u201cOldest brother of Ronald Bilius Weasley, Hogwarts first year student.\u201d</p>\n<p>Bill gathered his Gryffindor courage. \u201cYes, Director. May your enemies be terrorized and your gold pile high.\u201d</p>\n<p>The goblin king bared his teeth. \u201cThe first is nigh, Guide. You told the Paris branch you had an emergency.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, but I think you may already know something of it. I received a letter from my brother this morning.\u201d</p>\n<p>Another goblin entered the office by way of the hidden entrance that Bill knew led deep into the Horde\u2019s living quarters. He was also armed, and even more angry than Ragnok. He eyed Bill with bared teeth.</p>\n<p>\u201cGrimjaw is the Potter Account Manager,\u201d Ragnok said drily. \u201cHe is having a bad day.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yeah, the Horde <em>definitely</em> knew about what Ron had overheard.</p>\n<p>\u201cRon asked me to come to Hogwarts; he\u2019s especially concerned that the headmaster wants to place Ellie with our family and even encourage our mother to look at pairing he and Ellie Potter together.\u201d Grimjaw snarled, but Bill was used to the dangers of curse breaking and didn\u2019t flinch. \u201cThough I can\u2019t figure out what Albus Dumbledore has to do with assigning guardianship of children, if he does plant the idea in Mum\u2019s head. . .\u201d He shook his own. Angry goblins didn\u2019t phase him, but Molly Weasley on a mission? Yeah. \u201cI intended to go to the school, but I had to report the details of the conversation he overheard.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou mean the part when the ever-overstepping Albus Dumbledore believed he had the right or authority to even <em>consider</em> suppressing a sentinel? One wholly unrelated to him and who he has no legal authority over?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes sir.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAt least a few wizards have some <em>sense</em>,\u201d the chieftain snarled lowly. \u201cUnsurprising that it is a guide and a group of <em>children</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd a former Death Eater,\u201d someone grumbled.</p>\n<p>\u201cSeverus Snape is a bastard, but he\u2019s never lacked for common sense or survival instincts \u2014 barring a few instances during puberty,\u201d the wizard who emerged from the bank depths stated. \u201cHormones overcome the most sensible of us.\u201d</p>\n<p>He was dark haired and pale eyed, sharp and just as furious as the goblins beneath his humour. Goblin minds were structured so differently that they didn\u2019t project the way humans did; it was possible to actively scan them, but difficult. So Bill knew that the rage he was picking up belonged entirely to this wizard. Along with the war robes he was wearing, wand holsters on each hip, knives in his boots \u2014 and a dueling blade \u2014 he looked quite at home among goblins ready for war.</p>\n<p>Even before you realized he was sentinel.</p>\n<p>\u201cI know you,\u201d he realized. \u201cYou were friends with my uncles.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI was. You have the look of them.\u201d His smile was sharp. \u201cSirius Black. Are you coming with us to fuck up Dumbledore\u2019s day?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI guess I am.\u201d</p>\n<p><br>\nHe could hear her heartbeat from the moment the portkey released them in the entrance hall. Hogwarts wasn\u2019t heavily warded against sentinels \u2014 just the dorms as a matter of privacy and allowing young sentinels and guides to sleep. The stone walls of the castle did as much to dampen sound as anything else.</p>\n<p>But Sirius was a Hit Wizard and an Alpha Sentinel, one trained for and tested by war and with three months of healing and training at the hands of the goblins. He might not be at his peak yet \u2014 but he was close.</p>\n<p>Surrounded by ten goblin warriors and with a skilled guide nearby, he didn\u2019t hesitate to extend his hearing. And immediately found the rhythm he\u2019d imprinted on eleven years ago. Sirius didn\u2019t exactly zone on the sound \u2014 but he did <em>focus</em> on it while they headed up two flights of stairs.</p>\n<p>Which is why he heard that beloved beat spike.</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201c \u2014 not taking it!\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cI\u2019m in charge in this hospital wing and \u2014\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cI already tried to leave, but you won\u2019t let me!

Wait till Hagrid sees this!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know magical creatures could be spirit animals!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t think anyone is making you take anything, Ellie.\u201d</p>\n<p>If he wasn\u2019t so furious, Sirius would have laughed at the various, unfazed reactions of the first years. The adults weren\u2019t so composed; even Dumbledore seemed shocked.</p>\n<p>The redhaired matron recovered first. \u201cEleanor Potter, you put that creature away this instant! You \u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>From behind her dragon spirit animal \u2014 the first recorded in two centuries \u2014 a dark head popped up. It was disconcerting to hear a little girl\u2019s voice with a feral edge.</p>\n<p>\u201cShut up! Just shut up, I don\u2019t care if you\u2019re Ron\u2019s mum! You aren\u2019t mine! I won\u2019t put her away because she isn\u2019t a toy! And <em>don\u2019t</em> call me by my full name like you have a right! I don\u2019t even know you and you aren\u2019t my mum!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMs Potter \u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>Before either Molly Weasley or Dumbledore could trigger a second feral episode \u2014 did that make them trolls? \u2014 Sirius broke in. \u201c<b><em>Enough!</em></b>\u201d He was an Alpha, and a wizard; his voice was rich with power and shattered the building tension.</p>\n<p>\u201cSirius Black?\u201d Minerva exclaimed. \u201cBut \u2014 how? You\u2019re in Azkaban?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cApparently not. Perhaps Bagnold or Crouch will get my cell \u2014 unless the ICW drops them in deep, dark hole for their crimes against Britain, magic, and Sentinel and Guides.\u201d He saw understanding dawn on her stern face, followed by fury. Severus Snape, who Sirius was feeling generous towards, eyed the goblin contingent warily. Poppy, holding a potion, had yet to regain her composure and Dumbledore covered his dismay with a twinkle.</p>\n<p>Molly looked horrified. \u201cYou! What\u2019s a Dark Wizard doing here?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m innocent.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re still a Black! That whole family is Dark as they come!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIncluding your mother?\u201d he demanded. She flushed and paled. \u201cRemember her? Lucretia<em>Black</em> Prewett? My father\u2019s <em>sister</em>? We\u2019re first cousins, Molly; any argument against me involving my blood is irrelevant because you share it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut I wasn\u2019t raised by dark wizards!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMy mother being a vicious bitch had far more of an impact, actually.\u201d</p>\n<p>The kids \u2014 minus Ellie \u2014 chuckled, drawing Molly\u2019s ire. \u201cRonald \u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMum, does Dad know what\u2019s going on?\u201d Bill asked calmly from behind Sirius. \u201cSince it has to do with Ron being a guide?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBill, I didn\u2019t see you there! Of course not, he\u2019s at work. This is a favour to the Headmaster \u2014 he wants us \u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI know what he wants; Ron wrote to me last night. The headmaster doesn\u2019t have the right to place Ellie anywhere, much less with our family.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course he does!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy not your family, young William?\u201d Albus twinkled. \u201cA family known for guides is a perfect place to \u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd will you be tapping the Potter accounts to pay for it?\u201d Bill snapped. \u201cEven with Charlie and I gone, there are five children at home.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sure a stipend \u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhich you don\u2019t have the authority to grant, wizard!\u201d Ragnok snarled. \u201cThough that is the least of your overstepping. Lord Black, go to your child \u2014 the first to interfere loses a limb!\u201d Albus drew back abruptly, leaving Sirius a clear path to his girl.</p>\n<p>She was still mostly hidden behind the dragon \u2014 more of a drakeling, actually. Dark hair and green eyes peaked over a silver-blue wing, watching him carefully. So was the dragon, a young Opaleye with unusual colouring. Three other kids were also eyeing him.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re Lord Black,\u201d the sentinel with wild hair stated. \u201cEllie told us about your letter. I hope the people who did that to you do get dropped in a dark hole. There\u2019s no excuse for that kind of violation of your human rights.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat she said,\u201d the Weasley boy agreed. \u201cOnly I never talk like that, so not. But no one stands up to mum like that,\u201d he added, admiringly. \u201cBrilliant.\u201d</p>\n<p>A boy who could only be Frank and Alice\u2019s son shifted slightly. \u201cHello Lord Black.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHello Neville.\u201d</p>\n<p>The boy eyed him warily, then slowly relaxed. \u201cAre the goblins going to cut off someone\u2019s head?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s a distinct possibility.\u201d Behind him, several squeaks and attempted comments were cut off by goblin growls.</p>\n<p>\u201cCan we watch?\u201d Ron asked. \u201cOw!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHonestly, Ron.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re my godfather,\u201d Ellie stated. Sirius inhaled sharply, automatically reimprinting her voice. \u201cThe goblins did a good job \u2014 you don\u2019t look sick at all.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShould have seen me three months ago \u2014 I looked like a skeleton with eyes and hair.\u201d</p>\n<p>She shifted slightly and the drakeling settled her wings and curled up on the bed. Ellie leaned towards him slightly, then away, looking shy.</p>\n<p>Never let it be said he couldn\u2019t take a hint. Sirius stepped closer, smiling when he spotted the hair pins holding back dark curls. \u201cYour father bought those pins the day he found out you were a girl.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cReally?\u201d She reached up to touch the delicate gold and pearl pins.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes \u2014 when the healer told him he looked like someone had smacked him with a trout. When he came back to his senses, he took himself straight off. Lily sent me after him to \u2018keep that prat out of trouble\u2019.\u201d She grinned. \u201cWhich was a good thing, because he almost bought Lily the most hideous brooch ever made. James tended towards overkill when he got excited.\u201d His voice fell as he remembered that day; the war was still building and they were both run ragged as Hit Wizards, but it was before the prophecy and the fear that came afterwards. \u201cI talked him into a locket instead \u2014 something your mother would actually wear instead of throwing at his head. She teared up when he came home with gifts for both his girls.\u201d</p>\n<p>Ellie looked a little teary as well. \u201cDon\u2019t do that, love, or I\u2019ll have to give myself a boot in the arse.\u201d</p>\n<p>She giggled and sniffed back tears. \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s possible.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSomeone\u2019s probably come up with a spell. There are definitely stupider ones.\u201d She giggled again. \u201cThat\u2019s better. Right, that\u2019s it for my self control \u2014 if you don\u2019t want a hug, you should tell me now.\u201d</p>\n<p>Ellie ducked her head. Only sentinel hearing let him understand her murmured, \u201cHermione\u2019s the only person who\u2019s ever hugged me.\u201d He damn near went berserk on Dumbledore right then.</p>\n<p>Instead, he sat on the bed \u2014 immediately getting the warm weight of a dragon against his back. Cautiously, he gathered his goddaughter close.</p>\n<p>She pressed her face against his neck, inhaling sharply. \u201cI remember you,\u201d she managed on a sob.</p>\n<p>\u201cSense imprint,\u201d he murmured. \u201cYou were latent but you still gathered sensory information.\u201d He tucked her on his lap, opened his senses, and wallowed in the<em>smell/scent/touch </em>of his daughter in magic.</p>\n<p><br>\nEventually, Ellie sighed and stirred. Her godfather shifted, stroking her hair and smelling it. \u201cYou smell like apple blossoms and almonds.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnna sent me perfume,\u201d she explained. \u201cFor the Celtic New Year.\u201d Of course she\u2019d tried a little.</p>\n<p>He hummed. \u201cYour friend from Madam Malkin\u2019s shop.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUhuh. How\u2019d you know?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYour Anna went directly to Grimjaw with the bill for your new things,\u201d he explained softly. \u201cShe was ready to defend every purchase, because she didn\u2019t want anyone to think she took advantage of you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Ellie sat up. \u201cShe didn\u2019t! Everything we picked was nice <em>and</em> good quality, but not the most expensive thing there was! And \u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>He did something no one had ever done to her \u2014 smiled, and kissed her forehead. Ellie was shocked silent. \u201cI know, love. She could have sold you a dozen more things and not been taking advantage.\u201d</p>\n<p>She huffed, \u201cI don\u2019t have half as many clothes as Pavarti and Lavender.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPrincess Di has less clothes than Pavarti and Lavender,\u201d Hermione said tartly.</p>\n<p>Ellie looked over to her friends; Ron and Neville were sharing a nearby bed with Bill Weasley, and Hermione was perched on the chair by Ellie\u2019s bed. They all looked amused \u2014 and Hermione had that look, like she wanted to ask a million questions and was biting her tongue.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhere \u2014?\u201d</p>\n<p>The elder Weasley pointed to the other end of the ward, where all the adults and goblins looked to be arguing fiercely. Ellie tilted her head, listening, but could only hear a staticky murmur.</p>\n<p>\u201cMuffling ward,\u201d Sirius explained. \u201cYou can learn to hear past it, but it takes training and can be considered rude.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat are they saying?\u201d Ron asked.</p>\n<p>\u201cRonald! He just said it was rude!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, and so\u2019s talking about people when they aren\u2019t there,\u201d Ron pointed towards the group. \u201cDoesn\u2019t seem to bother them.\u201d</p>\n<p>Hermione looked torn; manners, or information.</p>\n<p>Sirius spared her the dilemma with a grin. \u201cRagnok is threatening Dumbledore with a public beheading; Minerva just found out why, and is offering to spare the Horde the expense. Molly. . .\u201d he paused, glancing at both Weasleys.</p>\n<p>\u201cIs she scolding the Chieftain?\u201d Bill asked worriedly. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t put it past her, but I\u2019d hate to be fired.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, but she is trying to convince Grimjaw that Ellie awakened for Ron and a marriage contract should be arranged.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Ron and Ellie shouted. Bill looked upset, and Hermione puffed up, her hair poofier than ever.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s <em>barbaric</em>! And, honestly, information about sentinels and guides is not hard to find \u2014 we already explained that if Ron was a match to Ellie or me, we\u2019d already know!\u201d</p>\n<p>Ellie turned back to Sirius. \u201cYou won\u2019t let anyone make me get married?\u201d</p>\n<p>He patted her shoulder, lifting her from his lap and onto the bed. \u201cSweet girl, no one will make you do anything you don\u2019t want to. Why don\u2019t you meet Godric while I sort this out.\u201d</p>\n<p>Before she could ask who Godric was, a mass of golden feathers rose from the floor at the end of the bed. A large head ending in a vicious beak settled on Ellie\u2019s lap, trilling. The silver-blue dragon from earlier clambered after the griffin, and curled around her back.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou should have seen it,\u201d Neville confided. \u201cThe headmaster tried to disturb you and Lord Black while you were being all. . .\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt was a sensory saturation,\u201d Hermione explained. \u201cIt\u2019s a little like imprinting, but usually between family members or spouses.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, that. Anyway, the griffin came out of nowhere, snarled until everyone else backed away, and then started grooming your dragon.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDo all magical sentinels have magical creatures for spirit animals?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Sirius told Hermione. \u201cBut it does happen. It\u2019s like regional differences in spirit animals \u2014 you see wolves in the Americas and Europe, but rarely lions and the reverse is true in Africa. Strong sentinels have apex predators; it just so happens that wixen are aware of a few more of them than most.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d Ellie asked. She wasn\u2019t ready for her newly found guardian to leave.</p>\n<p>\u201cTo make both your sentiments and my own known,\u201d he grinned. \u201cLoudly.\u201d</p>\n<p>Then he stalked down the hospital wing, drew his wand, and flung a blue spell that sounded like a gunshot.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\n<img src=\"https://darkseraphina.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/senses-of-magic-characters-3.jpg?w=840\" alt width=\"700\" height=\"394\">\n</p>\n<p>Sirius shattered the ward, surprising all the humans and amusing the goblins. \u201cRight, that\u2019s enough.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMy boy \u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI am neither yours, nor a boy, <em>Albus</em>. The fact that you really don\u2019t understand how serious a breach of law, ethics and decency you were willing to make \u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSirius \u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShut up before I <em>murder you</em>!\u201d Sirius\u2019s tenuous control frayed a little further. He didn\u2019t want his goddaughter witness him butcher the aging mage \u2014 but he had plenty of gold to pay for a mind healer if she needed one. \u201cYou can\u2019t begin to understand how much I would <em>enjoy</em> killing you, Albus. If you did, you wouldn\u2019t willing get within a hundred miles of me. You will stop meddling in the affairs of the Houses of Potter and Black \u2014 or the goblins and Minerva will have to get in line to kill you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou, Molly,\u201d he pointed to the matron, who looked indignant and wary, \u201care going to go home and mind your own business. Don\u2019t even speak. Maybe I could forgive you coming here at the headmaster\u2019s request \u2014 and maybe you accepting the task he asked of you, despite neither of you having the right to decide such things. <em>But</em>,\u201d he added sharply, \u201cI can\u2019t forgive your refusal to give up when it became clear you were neither needed nor wanted. And that\u2019s nothing compared to my feelings about your mercenary pursuit of my girl.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou can\u2019t speak to me like that, Black!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t like it, <em>leave</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cEnough, Molly,\u201d Minerva snapped abruptly. \u201c<em>Lord</em> Black can speak to you any way he wishes. The only thing you\u2019ve managed today is to embarrass your children and bully a child on an already difficult day. Ye can leave now,\u201d she added in a deep brogue, \u201cor I can escort ye.\u201d</p>\n<p>The Weasley matriarch left in an offended huff that no one regarded; that made her even angrier, but Sirius didn\u2019t care as long as there was one less person near his goddaughter.</p>\n<p>He eyed Snape and Minerva. \u201cStop looking nervous; I\u2019m not going to bite you. Certainly not when there are much better targets nearby,\u201d he glared at Albus.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe have already assured the potions master that, so long as he remains sensible, the Horde has no issue with him over recent events,\u201d Rangok stated.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s not our concern, Sirius,\u201d Minerva told him. \u201cThere\u2019s something else. I hoped that the Chieftain would be willing to remove and secure a certain item in the school.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMinerva \u2014\u201d Albus looked upset and. . . concerned.</p>\n<p>\u201cEnough, Albus! I\u2019ve told you over and over that I won\u2019t have it here! A castle full of children \u2014 one that apparently a <em>troll</em> can get into \u2014 is no place for an object like the Philosopher\u2019s Stone!\u201d</p>\n<p>Before Sirius could demand an explanation, Ragnok and the rest of the goblins began laughing. \u201cAlright, I missed the punchline.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShe speaks of the stone that was kept in a vault in the London Branch,\u201d the Chieftain explained. \u201cIt was removed this summer \u2014 the same day as a break-in attempt on the same vault.\u201d He grinned toothily. \u201cIt is a fake.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat!\u201d Minerva exploded. \u201cAlbus, you\u2019ve had us in a panic trying to protect a fake stone?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh the stone is a real ruby,\u201d Ragnok told her. \u201cBut it is not the <em>lapis philosophorum. </em>It is one of twelve decoy stones that the Horde created and protect in exchange for reasonable access to Flamel\u2019s stone.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd the real one?\u201d Snape asked. \u201cPresumably hidden in an obvious and inconspicuous place.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIndeed, but it\u2019s greatest protection is the fact that only the one who creates it may use it.\u201d Ragnok eyed Dumbledore\u2019s twinkling eyes with disdain. \u201cHowever most do not know that, and might seek what they believe to be the real stone by any means.\u201d He turned back to Minerva. \u201cWe will take the stone with us, and make a show of doing so.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThank you, Chieftain.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s another concern,\u201d Snape spoke quietly. He looked straight at Sirius, and his lack of a sneer was proof of his seriousness. \u201cOne of the teachers here is a direct threat to Potter.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat kind of threat,\u201d he asked sharply.</p>\n<p>\u201cGranger showed no reaction or awakening in his presence; there are three other sentinels in the school currently, and their only trouble with him is the garlic he uses in his classroom.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSeverus \u2014\u201d Grimjaw prodded Albus with a speartip.</p>\n<p>\u201cBe silent, wizard.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThere are also several guides in the school, and none report anything more than a mild headache in his presence. Potter however, received crippling headaches, spikes, and an increase in her senses after each class \u2014 even after the sentinel ward was adjusted.\u201d The potions master raised a brow. \u201cThe only other class she had trouble with was mine; mild zones related to scent and a few rashes from ingredients, which settled with an adjustment to her sentinel ward.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGive me his name.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cQuirinus Quirrell.\u201d</p>\n<p><br>\n\u201cWhy do you have to go?\u201d Ellie whispered.</p>\n<p>Sirius pulled her onto his lap, and she pressed her face to his shoulder and inhaled his familiar and comforting scent. \u201cDid your senses spike in his presence, love?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes \u2014 but he keeps garlic in his classroom! He\u2019s afraid of everything, including vampires.\u201d</p>\n<p>He hummed. \u201cReally? So you never had a reaction outside of class?\u201d</p>\n<p>She thought about that for a minute. \u201cWell, I did meet him the day I went to Diagon Alley and I got a rash \u2014 but lots of people shook my hand or touched me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat about at the feast, Ellie?\u201d Ron asked. \u201cYou had a spike when you looked at the staff table \u2014 we thought it was Snape,\u201d he explained to Sirius, \u201cbut it never happened again.\u201d</p>\n<p>Hermione bit her lip. \u201cMy parents taught me that if I had a sensory spike in someone\u2019s presence, I needed to inform them.\u201d She looked upset. \u201cI should have made Ellie tell someone.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShe did tell Professor Snape, who told Minerva and now me. Do you know why you were told that, Hermione?\u201d She shook her head. Ron\u2019s brother patted her shoulder comfortingly, but he looked worried. \u201cIt\u2019s very rare for children to awaken; no one under five ever has. Under the age of twelve, the most common cause is an accident \u2014 automotive in the muggle world, and magical in ours. The death of a parent is the second most common.\u201d</p>\n<p>Ellie tipped her head back, watching Sirius\u2019s solemn face. \u201cObviously things can be different in war zones or certain parts of the world. However, in Europe and the Americas we\u2019ve learned that children sometimes awaken because they\u2019ve been in the presence of a predator.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLike a werewolf?\u201d Neville asked.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe means paedophiles,\u201d Bill explained gently. \u201cThat\u2019s why sentinel authorities investigate children awakening \u2014 especially more than one in the same school or neighbourhood.\u201d</p>\n<p>Oh. That was. . . \u201cYou think Professor Quirrell. . . ?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI think Hermione would have awakened as well if that were true \u2014 you\u2019re the same age.\u201d He shared a dark look with Bill. \u201cBut there are other kinds of threats as well, especially for you. He could be a sympathizer to the Death Eaters, or even a previously unknown one.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBecause I\u2019m the Girl-Who-Lived.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd because your dad was a Hit Wizard. There are probably a few kids in this school related to people who your dad or I arrested \u2014 or killed \u2014 during the war.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat about after twelve?\u201d Hermione asked.</p>\n<p>Ellie felt Sirius\u2019s muscles tense, then he sighed. \u201cYou and Ellie should both know this, actually. Do you know how many female sentinels and guides there are in the world?\u201d</p>\n<p>Hermione got her distant, reciting from a book look; Ron Neville and Ellie exchanged grins. \u201cThe numbers aren\u2019t precise \u2014 some countries don\u2019t publish numbers, or refuse to give the Sentinel and Guide authorities access to their populations \u2014 usually countries that have repressive laws or cultures leading to high emigration rates. But the world average for females online is approximately 22 percent of guides and 19 percent of sentinels. Latent numbers are hard to calculate because many countries don\u2019t do genetic testing, and the accuracy of those tests can vary.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s about the same as the magical world,\u201d Bill said.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat you don\u2019t know,\u201d Sirius explained gently, \u201cis that within that population \u2014 less than forty percent of latent males awaken, but eighty percent of women do.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Ron asked.</p>\n<p>\u201cBetween the age of fourteen and twenty four, the second most common trigger for a woman awakening \u2014 is sexual assault.\u201d Sirius squeezed Ellie. \u201cAfter that age it becomes third \u2014 with pregnancy or children and accidents making the first two.\u201d</p>\n<p>Ellie looked at Hermione, who seemed as upset as she felt. \u201cWhy doesn\u2019t anyone talk about that?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou probably would have been told in a few years \u2014 it\u2019s not something that anyone, including me, feels comfortable bringing up to children.\u201d Sirius sighed. \u201cBut also because, talking about it would force people to accept that there\u2019s something wrong with society instead of pretending that each case is an isolated incident.\u201d</p>\n<p>Ron and Neville looked a little sick, but Ellie felt kind of. . . <em>numb</em>. \u201cI. . . I don\u2019t. . .\u201d</p>\n<p>Sirius hugged her firmly. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to think about this too much right now; it\u2019s terrible, but you\u2019re still just children and it\u2019s not your job to fix the mistakes of adults. Not yet anyway. But, I wanted you to know<em> why</em> I need to deal with Quirrell, and why people might react oddly to the fact that you\u2019ve all awakened young.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s why you asked me all those questions!\u201d Ron told his brother. \u201cBlimey, I thought you\u2019d gotten too much sun!\u201d</p>\n<p><br>\nSirius left his girl tucked away in one of the private apartments attached to Gryffindor, accompanied by her friends, Stonefist and Minerva. Technically, Ellie was entitled to one of those private rooms as a noble and a sentinel; so far she seemed content rooming with her clever friend. Pomphrey had objected to the removal of all four students, but he\u2019d put his foot down. Ellie, and the other kids, didn\u2019t trust the matron after the earlier debacle.</p>\n<p>He could feel the sentinel under his skin emerging as Snape led the way to the DADA classroom. Grimjaw, Ragnok, Bill, and three other goblins accompanied him. Sirius could feel the young cursebreaker buffering him; it helped if only a little. He had a feeling there would be bloodshed soon; years of captivity, his first venture from Gringotts\u2019 caverns, the return of his girl and a potential threat to her. . . Violence burned in his blood, demanding an outlet.</p>\n<p>They all knew it; he\u2019d even warned his companions to get out of his way if he went berserk. Someone, however, hadn\u2019t gotten the message.</p>\n<p>\u201cI really must object.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFile a complaint,\u201d he snarled at Dumbledore.</p>\n<p>\u201cQuirinus is entitled to \u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPrivacy? Due process? To do whatever he wants as long as it doesn\u2019t interfere with your grand plans? You\u2019re the headmaster of a school and one of your teachers is a direct threat to a student \u2014 and you think it should shrugged off?\u201d</p>\n<p>He didn\u2019t get an answer; they reached the door of Quirrell\u2019s office. Sirius held up a hand and listened; he could hear a muffled hiss and low murmuring. \u201cThe room is warded against sound. Not a muffling ward, but something stronger.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSomething to hide,\u201d Ragnok stated.</p>\n<p>\u201cOr for privacy,\u201d Albus offered. \u201cMy office is similarly warded.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAs I said,\u201d the chieftain drawled.</p>\n<p>Snape entered first; apparently he routinely stalked the DADA professor and this behaviour was normal. He left the door cracked open, sneering out a, \u201cQuirrell. Recovered from your traumatic ordeal last night?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cP-p-prof-es-s-or S-s-nap-pe,\u201d a second voice stammered. The heartbeat that Sirius could now hear didn\u2019t falter or spike.</p>\n<p>Strike one.</p>\n<p>\u201cHow interesting that no one saw you after your. . . momentous announcement. Is that a dog bite I see?\u201d</p>\n<p>He breathed in, and nearly gagged on the garlic scent. No wonder all the sentinels in the school developed headaches around the man. Under it, however, Sirius could smell something far worse. Corruption and rot.</p>\n<p>Strike two.</p>\n<p>\u201cI-I-I r-r-r-an back-k-k to m-m-m-y rooms-s-s. T-t-troll-s-s-s, you k-k-know.\u201d Lie.</p>\n<p>Strike three.</p>\n<p>\u201cReally?\u201d Sirius sauntered in the room. \u201cBecause you smell like a liar who rolled in garbage.\u201d</p>\n<p>The quivering wreck of a man startled in truth this time, heartbeat spiking at the sight of the armoured goblins who followed him and closed the door. \u201cW-w\u2013w-ho?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDrop the act,\u201d he snarled. \u201cThat stutter is more fake than my great-aunt\u2019s wig.\u201d</p>\n<p>From beneath the turban, the faintest of hisses emerged. No one else seemed to hear it; Sirius assumed the fabric itself was spelled.</p>\n<p>\u201cWard the room; he\u2019s possessed.\u201d</p>\n<p>Quirrell\u2019s fearful demeanor fell away; his eyes were wide and shocked even as he drew his wand. The hissing increased and the man flinched, muttering, \u201cBut Master. . .\u201d</p>\n<p>Bill and one of the goblins drew wardstones from their pockets, flinging them towards the windows and doors. The stones flashed and ordered themselves around each entrance, forming self-sustaining wards.</p>\n<p>Quirrell reached up, pulled away his turban, and turned around</p>\n<p>\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-684 alignright\" src=\"https://darkseraphina.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/quirrell-voldemort.jpg?w=840\" alt=\"Quirrell &amp;amp; Voldemort\" align=\"left\">\n</p>\n<p>\u201cPathetic,\u201d Ragnok hissed.</p>\n<p>Sirius had seen the Dark Lord Voldemort before; he\u2019d faced several times, in fact. He\u2019d even drawn the bastard\u2019s blood, though he\u2019d lost some of his own as well. So he recognized the monster that had killed his brother Regulus, hunted his goddaughter, and murdered James and Lily.</p>\n<p>Despite the state he was currently in.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat the fuck did you do to yourself, you stupid fucking wanker?\u201d</p>\n<p>Apparently even Dark Lord\u2019s could be struck speechless. Good to know.</p>\n<p><em>\u201cYou dare,\u201d </em>he hissed, finally. <em>\u201cYou </em><b><em>dare</em></b><em> speak so to me, Lord Voldemort? Fear my name, fool. Fear</em><b><em>me</em></b><em>.\u201d</em></p>\n<p>\u201cFuck, not on a wager. You were far more intimidating ten years ago, and you\u2019d already managed to lose your nose and all hope of a tan.\u201d He turned to Ragnok. \u201cIdeas?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe could set them both on fire; Fiendfyre might take out both of them.\u201d</p>\n<p>Albus, Quirrell and Voldemort all squawked. \u201cMight damage the castle and scare the kids.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTrue.\u201d He eyed the possessed figure. \u201cDo you have your full kit with you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes \u2014 ah, I see.\u201d Sirius reached into one of the pouches in his Hit Wizard uniform and withdrew a fist-sized crystal. It was one of the more obscure items in an Unspeakable\u2019s kit, but he still knew how to use it.</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cWhat\u2019s this? You think a stone can defeat me?\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u201cMaster \u2014\u201d Quirrell began, warily.</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cQuiet, fool! If you had gotten the Philosopher\u2019s Stone the first time this would not be happening!\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u201cYou mean the fake stone in vault 713?\u201d Ragnok grinned. \u201cA pretty bauble \u2014 pity you didn\u2019t get it, as trying to use it would have killed you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFake?\u201d Quirrell managed.</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cYou lie!\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u201cThe last wizard who called me a liar decorated a pike in front of my bank,\u201d Ragnok snapped.</p>\n<p>\u201cAny last words, Quirrell?\u201d Sirius asked.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m going to kill you, thus expelling the wraith possessing you so we can trap him in a Soul Shard.\u201d He smiled darkly. \u201cThough you\u2019re half-dead already.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSirius, you cannot kill \u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s hardly the first Death Eater to die by my wand,\u201d he told the shocked headmaster. \u201cBesides, he\u2019s been dead since he accepted that wraith\u2019s possession.</p>\n<p>Quirrell didn\u2019t get a chance to speak his last words; the wraith of Voldemort abandoned his host in a rush of corrupted magic and stench. The DADA professor collapsed like a puppet whose strings had been cut, extremities already crumbling into dust.</p>\n<p><em>\u201cYou\u2019ll pay for this!\u201d</em> the wraith screamed, rushing towards the window . . .</p>\n<p>. . . and bounced off in a blue-white flash of magic.</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cWhat?\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Albus echoed.</p>\n<p>\u201cAs I told Lady Potter,\u201d Grimjaw growled, \u201cthere is no magic stronger or more stable than a well-made ward.\u201d</p>\n<p>The former dark lord flung himself frantically at each window and door, repelled each time. Then he tried to pass through the ceiling, and screamed in rage when the wards created an arc between them, repelling him again.</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cYou </em>\n<b>\n<em>dare</em>\n</b>\n<em>? Foolish, wretched creatures! I am Lord Voldemort! I will </em>\n<b>\n<em>not</em>\n</b>\n<em> be defied! I will not be\u00a0</em>\n<b>\n<em>defeated</em>\n</b>\n<em>!\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>Bill was examining the wraith carefully, despite it\u2019s frantic fluttering. \u201cThere\u2019s something wrong.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOther than the obvious?\u201d a goblin named Brassknuckle drawled.</p>\n<p>But Sirius could see it too, and drew one of his wands \u2014 the ebony and dragon heartstring wand he\u2019d received when he\u2019d awakened \u2014 and cast the strongest freezing spell he knew. The wraith was forced into stillness for ten heartbeats, more than enough for them to see the problem.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s missing pieces,\u201d the guide breathed.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou stupid, corrupt, scum-sucking <em>cunt</em>,\u201d Sirius hissed. \u201cYou fractured your fucking <em>soul</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Horcrux,\u201d</em> the goblins all growled, turning and spitting in unison.</p>\n<p>\u201cMore than one, judging by the holes in his spirit. Buggering fucking bastard.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHorcrux?\u201d Snape murmured.</p>\n<p>Bill glanced over at the potions master. \u201cAn ancient technique for seeking immortality. You ritually sever a piece of the soul and place it in an object. The egyptians favoured it for a few centuries.\u201d</p>\n<p><em>\u201cI have gone further than any before me in the search for immortality,\u201d </em>Voldemort breathed. <em>\u201cI am immortal!\u201d</em></p>\n<p>\u201cYou should have gone into alchemy if you wanted immortality,\u201d Sirius snapped. \u201cHorcruxes are the path of insanity and irredeemable evil. You violated Lady Magic and your own soul.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDid it ever occur to you that you\u2019d never met an immortal ancient Egyptian?\u201d Ragnok spat at the spector. \u201cHorcruxes don\u2019t <em>work</em> \u2014 if you were immortal, you would still be alive instead of this <em>thing</em>,\u201d he gestured. \u201cI tire of listening to these rantings. Lord Black, complete your business.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWait, Sirius! What are you going to do?\u201d Albus asked, frantically. \u201cHe can only be defeated by the child in the prophecy!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFuck prophecy, Albus. We make our own fate.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sirius threw the crystal shard he still held towards the wraith, then hit the moving stone with a spell; activating and charging the shard in one. Voldemort tried to swoop away from it, but was caught in the acid blue light that emerged from the active stone. He screamed once.</p>\n<p>The Soul Shard fell soundlessly to the floor, pulsing with an ugly glow from within. Grimjaw produced a warded box and wandlessly levitated the stone inside it. Then he handed the box to Sirius. \u201cOne Dark Lord in poor condition. No returns or exchanges.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat happened? Sirius \u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>Ragnok pushed Albus aside. \u201cYou should take that to MI4, Lord Black. Inform Silence that the Horde will assist in the search for the Horcruxes. It will be made easier by having the trapped soul in our possession.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSympathetic magic; we can use one part of the whole to find the rest.\u201d Sirius considered for a moment. \u201cI would prefer that this object be placed in Gringotts; while I trust the majority of the DOM, there was at least one traitor among us in the war and it would only take one error to see this piece of shite released.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSirius, it must be studied \u2014\u201d Snape\u2019s silencing spell cut off Albus before he could say something that might get him killed.</p>\n<p>\u201cIf Sentinel Lord Black is willing to entrust the Horde with this task, then we shall secure, hide, and protect the Soul Stone containing the fractured wraith of the Dark Lord known as Voldemort,\u201d Ragnok agreed solemnly. \u201cOnly you, myself, Silence, and those we choose personally, will have access to the warded cavern it will be contained in.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAgreed,\u201d Sirius nodded, and drew a knife from his boot. He offered the blade \u2014 Damascus steel and dragon bone \u2014 to the Chieftain, and accepted a wickedly sharp Goblin-forged dagger in exchange.</p>\n<p>\u201cProfit and war, Sentinel Lord Black.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBlood and gold, Chieftain Ragnok.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat just happened?\u201d The headmaster asked, having broken the silencing spell.</p>\n<p>Bill smirked. \u201cThey just made an alliance and declared war on Voldemort.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\n<em>\n<img src=\"https://darkseraphina.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/kings-cross-station.jpg?w=840\" alt width=\"550\" height=\"406\">\n</em>\n</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\n<em><br>\nEpilogue</em>\n</p>\n<p>Iain Granger waited with his wife and guide at King\u2019s Cross Station. He was anxious to see his daughter; four months without her heartbeat and scent had been an adjustment for him as a sentinel and a father. The old-fashioned train had only just come to a stop, and Helena gripped his hand tightly to keep him in place.</p>\n<p>\u201cLet her come to us, dear.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHelena. . .\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIain. . .\u201d</p>\n<p>He smiled at her cheerful mocking, but was distracted from responding by the exodus from the train. The platform rapidly filled with adolescents home for the holidays. Names were called, some tears were shed, and there were any number of voices saying \u2018look how much you\u2019ve grown\u2019 and \u2018mu-<em>um</em>\u2019.</p>\n<p>A cluster of children leapt down from a carriage near the end of the train; Iain dialled up to take in the sight of his daughter. She was smiling widely, happy and healthy. Her hair was almost tamed; a letter early in the school year had sent Helena to Diagon Alley to purchase a charmed brush. She was bundled up in a cloak and scarf, cheeks slightly pink from the December air, and arm-in-arm with the dark-haired girl that he and Helena had met in September.</p>\n<p>Two boys followed them; he wanted to sigh. Months of letters full of Ellie, Ron and Neville told him that these particular boys weren\u2019t a concern. Ron was a guide, though not a match to his daughter, and Neville was as mundane as a wizard could be considered and therefore not a potential future boyfriend. But he had a feeling that the sight of Hermione and Ellie being followed by eager males was a foretelling of the future.</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t you start, Iain. She\u2019s so happy to have friends.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t know why she can\u2019t make friends with other girls.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBecause teenage girls are terrible, petty creatures.\u201d</p>\n<p>A man left the train and accepted Ellie\u2019s hand, grinning at the chattering kids. Presumably Lord Black, who had spent the last month and a half at Hogwarts, training his goddaughter and the other online sentinels at Hogwarts. Iain had gotten a long letter full of outrage and fire over the treatment of Sirius Black; only the fact that the goblins were dealing with the issue had stopped him from informing the London Prides.</p>\n<p>A formidable matron with \u2014 a vulture? On her <em>hat</em>? \u2014 strode towards the kids. He dialled up his hearing slightly, ignoring Helena\u2019s huff of amusement. He was nosy \u2014 it came with the territory.</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cNeville.\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cHello, Gran. These are my friends \u2014 Ellie Potter, Hermione Granger and Ron Weasley. And this is \u2014\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cSirius Black.\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cMadam Longbottom.\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cI received your letter.\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cI\u2019m glad to hear it.\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cYou were. . . not wrong. Neville has an appointment with Ollivander on Monday.\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cI do?\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cLord Black asked me if I was able to use my parents wands effectively, and reminded me that even within families, wand compatibility is rare. My mother\u2019s wand never worked for me; in fact it disliked me a great deal.\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cMy mother\u2019s wand bit me.\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t surprise me at all that Walburga had a vicious wand.\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cMrs Longbottom, can Neville meet my parents? If it isn\u2019t inconvenient for you?\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cMs Granger, correct? You have excellent manners. Neville, I will wait near the platform exit with your trunk. Don\u2019t take too long, we have tea with Algie and Enid.\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cYes Gran.\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>There was a second exchange with a tall, elegant woman, full of \u2018cousin\u2019 and subtleties between her and Lord Black; Iain got the impression that they were conspirators in something. Also, her son was a brat but that Ellie Potter had his number.</p>\n<p>A group of redheads approached; Ron looked wary and asked the balding man, <em>\u201cWhere\u2019s Mum?\u201d</em></p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cAt home; I thought it would be. . . simpler.\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cWell-reasoned \u2014\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201c \u2014 and sensible.\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cIs she. . .\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cShe\u2019s been. . . upset lately. Especially since Percy \u2014\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201c \u2014 was robbed of my well-earned position?\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cThree first-years asked you for help and you threatened to take points, Percy. Professor McGonagall explained everything that happened to me, and I agree with her.\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cFather!\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cYour brother could have been </em>\n<b>\n<em>killed</em>\n</b>\n<em>. We\u2019re going to have a family meeting tonight; Bill and Charlie are home for a week and we have lots of things to discuss. Now, I presume this is Neville, Ellie and Hermione? Lovely to meet you all.\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cHello, sir.\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cOh no, none of that. Arthur or Mr Weasley if you must be formal. I hope to see you during the holidays. Sirius.\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cArthur. You\u2019re looking well.\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cSirius, I can\u2019t tell you how sorry \u2014\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cArthur, you had nothing to do with what happened.\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cI should have \u2014\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cYou would have lost your job in a heartbeat; Bagnold, Crouch and Fudge all had a vested interest in keeping me where I was. Please, don\u2019t blame yourself.\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>He didn\u2019t hear the rest of that conversation because Hermione spotted them and darted forward. \u201cMum! Dad!\u201d</p>\n<p>Helena caught her when she flung herself forward; Iain hugged them both, inhaling the scent of his child and his guide together. Hermione\u2019s scent was different: the new hair products, a faintly bitter scent of potions, and an indescribable scent that said \u2018sentinel\u2019. She was definitely coming online, and very soon.</p>\n<p>After a moment, Hermione pulled back. \u201cMum, Dad \u2014 these are my friends.\u201d</p>\n<p><br>\nEllie left the platform with Sirius. Her small travel trunk was in her pocket, along with Hermione\u2019s phone number and Ron and Neville\u2019s floo addresses.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo, we\u2019ll go to the Centre tomorrow?\u201d</p>\n<p>Sirius nodded. \u201cYou need to be registered and tested, and I need to be retested.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe that someone lied to the Centre and told them you were dead,\u201d she huffed. \u201cIt\u2019s so. . . stupid.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTechnically, the previous minister didn\u2019t correct them when they assumed I was dead.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHermione would say that that\u2019s semantics.\u201d</p>\n<p>Her godfather laughed mischievously. \u201cLove, semantics and loopholes are a prankster\u2019s best tools.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m telling Professor McGonagall you\u2019re encouraging me to make trouble.\u201d</p>\n<p>He chuckled. \u201cIf I didn\u2019t she might think I was an imposter.\u201d He pulled her out of the way of a tourist carrying too many bags. \u201cSo: the Centre tomorrow, dinner at the Granger\u2019s the day after and Yule next week. We also need to see the goblins at some point. What else do you want to do during the hols?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cRon said that they have room to play Quidditch at his house, but his mum. . .\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI think Arthur Weasley is going to deal with Molly, but if you want room to fly we can spend a day or two at Castle Ravensmoor; I need to check on the repairs and warding the goblins have been doing.\u201d</p>\n<p>Six months ago she\u2019d live in a cupboard at the dreadful Dursleys; now she lived with her godfather, who owned a castle. Magic was utterly mad; it was <em>brilliant</em>.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou said that sentinels and guides need a second wand when they come online \u2014 awaken,\u201d she corrected. \u201cCan I \u2014?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAbsolutely. Actually, I think I\u2019ll make an appointment with Bacchetta. A few days in Rome will be a nice change from the damp English winter.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cRome? Really?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAbsolutely. I haven\u2019t had a good pasta in years.\u201d</p>\n<p>Ellie considered that. Weeks in Sirius\u2019 company \u2014 he and McGonagall had forced the Headmaster to let Sirius stay at Hogwarts \u2014 had shown her that, despite moments of depression and bitterness, Sirius tried to keep a sense of humour about what had been done to him. Sometimes Ellie thought that she was angrier about his imprisonment than he was. Sirius seemed so eager to make her happy; maybe she shouldn\u2019t worry about being too much work and let him.</p>\n<p>\u201cCan we visit Remus?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLove, Remus is going to move in with us if I have to hogtie him. Actually,\u201d he mused, \u201cnow that the curse on the DADA position is broken,\u201d and that had been <em>brilliant</em> to watch, \u201cI should get Minerva to offer him the job. Shacklebolt is only on medical leave for another two months.\u201d</p>\n<p>They dodged a group of crying families and a couple who were kissing like the end of a sappy movie \u2014 Sirius chuckled when she told him that \u2014 and made it to the exit before Ellie ventured to bring up one more thing. \u201cSirius?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, love?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCould we go for tea some time? I mean, a proper tea?\u201d She rushed to explain. \u201cIt\u2019s just. . . every month, Aunt Petunia and Daisy would get dressed up and go for tea in London. Daisy just wanted the fancy cakes and creams and to get a new fancy dress every few months. Petunia told her that all girls deserved to dress up and have a nice tea and. . .\u201d</p>\n<p>Sirius drew her towards a bench, sat down and wrapped his arm around her shoulders. \u201cLove, we will go to tea any time you like. High tea, low tea, cream tea \u2014 absolutely.\u201d He kissed her forehead. \u201cIn fact, that\u2019s the best idea I\u2019ve heard all day; I\u2019ll eat as many scones and jam as you want me too.\u201d</p>\n<p>She giggled and hugged him back fiercely. \u201cNot too many, or you\u2019ll spend every day fencing with goblins to stay in shape.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNow that I think about it, there was a great place in Westminster. They had these brilliant salmon and cucumber sandwiches and scones as big as your head.\u201d He looked cheerful. \u201cAny more clever ideas, love?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell. . .\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCan I get a sword?\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\n<img src=\"https://darkseraphina.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/banner-senses-of-magic-spirit-animals.jpg?w=840\" alt width=\"750\" height=\"416\">\n</p>"
