  "text": "<p>\n<span>Chen isn\u2019t new to working in large homes for rich clients. When he was just thirteen years old he started doing any work he could in order to help provide for his family. That work consisted of running errands, cleaning houses, working on yards, and just about any other menial labor that the rich were willing to pay a child very little money to do.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>But, Chen supposes those years of frustrating work have given him enough credible experience for this new job of his. A very well paying and more respectable job at that, too.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>That is to say, Chen has gone from cleaning his rich neighbors\u2019 homes in exchange for little pay, to now working in the palace for a pretty nice paycheck that all but ensures his family\u2019s ability to pay their bills.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>If Chen had been a bender, been a better fighter, been more clever, he could have joined the army when he came of age and supported his family that way. But, he\u2019s not a bender, he\u2019s not a particularly good fighter, and while he\u2019s always had decent grades, he\u2019s not sure he\u2019s clever enough to overlook his other faults. So, he\u2019d had to help his family in any other way he could, which is how he ended up working in houses anyway.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>But, he supposes it\u2019s worked out rather nicely for him in the end. The war is over, times are heading towards peace, and he doesn\u2019t have to feign shame for not being able to become a soldier. Instead, he can reap the benefits that came from their new Fire Lord more or less starting the staff from scratch after ridding all of the die-hard Ozai supporters with a sweet new job that he\u2019s only a little nervous about taking.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>(Fire Lord Zuko may be all about peace and ending wars and fighting, but he\u2019s still Ozai\u2019s son. Chen doesn\u2019t </span>\n<em>\n<span>think </span>\n</em>\n<span>Fire Lord Zuko would be as cruel as his father, but he\u2019s not going to be putting that theory to test any time soon.)</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Regardless of his nerves and his parent\u2019s endless warning to </span>\n<em>\n<span>be careful in there</span>\n</em>\n<span>, Chen thinks working in the palace is a risk worth taking. Even though he\u2019s starting at a low level, the pay is more than he\u2019s ever had, and the thought that his parents won\u2019t have to work as hard, and his little brothers can keep going to school instead of worrying about working, makes his job of walking around the palace grounds and dusting every single painting and tapestry worth it.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Sure, the sneezing from all the dust sucks, but it\u2019s a small price to pay in the grand scheme of things. Who would have thought there could be </span>\n<em>\n<span>so many </span>\n</em>\n<span>paintings in the palace? Chen is both horrified and kind of impressed.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Of course, it\u2019s a month into this job, when Chen has found his rhythm, is feeling confident in his place here, and has even made work friends, that everything goes wrong.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Chen has figured out the most efficient route to take throughout the palace to find all the things he has to dust without getting lost and without having to walk through the entire palace. The first week he was working here, he followed around one of the more seasoned workers, one of the ones who hadn\u2019t quit or was fired, so that he could get a feel for the layout of the palace. The other worker had shown him a few shortcuts and pathways to use that would make getting around the palace a lot easier, and Chen had even found a few of his own to utilize.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Unfortunately, now that he\u2019s no longer in danger of getting lost or wandering into someplace he\u2019s not supposed to be, Chen\u2019s been doing this route alone. Which of course, only makes it worse when he inevitably messes things up.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Chen had decided on his first day that the long, lone stretch of hallway, home only to a large portrait of Fire Lord Sozin, was his least favorite place in the whole palace. He swore the hallway itself was void of any warmth, all the light being sucked into the torches lining the walls, leaving the hallway feeling cold and dark despite the fire making light. Chen is </span>\n<em>\n<span>sure </span>\n</em>\n<span>that the eyes of Fire Lord Sozin follow him as he walks, and judge him as he dusts the dead man's portrait. The thing radiates negative energy, the same negative energy he\u2019s sure Fire Lord Sozin had when he was alive.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>The point is, Chen hates it, and he doesn\u2019t like to spend any more time than necessary in the same area as it.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Chen saves dusting this portrait until last for this very reason. He can take his time on the others, which conveniently keeps him away from this one for longer, and because it\u2019s his last one, he can find his supervisor and tell her he\u2019s finished as soon as he rushes through it. He hasn\u2019t dared to skip it, just in case someone finds out and he gets in trouble, but no one has said anything about him rushing through it.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>(Chen thinks the portrait gives everyone the creeps, and that\u2019s why no one has said anything about him spending less than five minutes to clean a portrait that takes up a large portion of the hallway.)</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Today is just like every other day Chen has been at the palace. He arrives in the morning, checks in with his supervisor, leaves his things in his designated spot in the servants\u2019 quarters, says hello to the few people he\u2019s talked to more than once, gathers his cleaning supplies, and gets to work. Around midday, his supervisor finds him and tells him to take a break, and he makes his way back to the servants\u2019 quarters, eats lunch with a girl named Maya who works in the laundry room but seems to be there the same hours as him. After lunch, he gets back to work, not reaching The Portrait until late afternoon.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Today, though, things go wrong while he\u2019s working with the portrait.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Since it takes up so much of the wall, Chen has to get a small stool in order to be able to reach the top to wipe off all the dust. But, when he\u2019s climbing down the stool, his feet somehow get tangled in the rungs, causing him to fall to the floor.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>While trying to stop himself from falling, Chen had been flailing his arms in a desperate attempt to regain his balance. All his flailing manages to do, however, is smack his arm into one of the torches lining the wall. The force of his arm hitting the torch causes it to fall from its holder. Chen watches from the floor in horror as the torch falls, and somehow, </span>\n<em>\n<span>somehow, </span>\n</em>\n<span>on its way down, the flame touches the portrait of Fire Lord Sozin. Which then begins to </span>\n<em>\n<span>catch fire</span>\n</em>\n<span>. Chen feels like he\u2019s watching everything happen in slow motion as the portrait is slowly being eaten up by flames. </span>\n<em>\n<span>The portrait of Fire Lord Sozin is on fire holy shit.\u00a0</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Chen thinks he\u2019s going to faint.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Instead, he jumps up, still tangled in the </span>\n<em>\n<span>damned stool, he swears he\u2019s never using it again, </span>\n</em>\n<span>and desperately looks around for something to put out the flame. If he was a bender, he could stop the fire easily, but </span>\n<em>\n<span>he\u2019s not a bender, shit what is he going to do?</span>\n</em>\n<span> A little way down the hallway, he spots a potted plant that for reasons he\u2019s not going to question, is also here in this lone hallway. Without thought, Chen grabs it and runs back to the portrait </span>\n<em>\n<span>that\u2019s still on fire</span>\n</em>\n<span>. He takes the plant from the pot, relieved to find some water in the bottom. He\u2019s staring at the fire, trying to figure out where to toss the water that will hopefully put out a majority of, if not all of, the fire. He\u2019s just about to toss it when a voice speaks from behind him.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWell, this looks dangerous.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>A startled shout escapes his throat and Chen whirls around to see who\u2019s behind him. The momentum causes the water to fly out of the pot and onto the person who spoke.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Chen looks from the pot that betrayed him to the face of the person standing in front of him.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>To the face of Fire Lord Zuko.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>The </span>\n<em>\n<span>soaked </span>\n</em>\n<span>face of Fire Lord Zuko.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Chen drops the pot in shock, he\u2019s not even sure he\u2019s breathing at this point. He\u2019s panicking, though, that\u2019s for sure. He\u2019s just set a portrait of a previous Fire Lord </span>\n<em>\n<span>on fire </span>\n</em>\n<span>and then </span>\n<em>\n<span>threw water on the current Fire Lord. </span>\n</em>\n<span>Chen feels his chest tighten as thoughts of what his punishment could be flash through his mind. He could be fired, he could be banished, he could be arrested, </span>\n<em>\n<span>he could be killed. </span>\n</em>\n<span>He knows he needs to fall to his knees and start apologizing </span>\n<em>\n<span>now </span>\n</em>\n<span>to at least try and assuage some of the anger he knows is coming. But, he feels like he\u2019s paralyzed with fear and all he can do is stare at Fire Lord Zuko with wide, terrified eyes.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThat was a bit unexpected,\u201d Fire Lord Zuko says, wiping water from his eyes. And Chen\u2026</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Chen faints.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>When he comes to, he\u2019s very confused. Chen is laying on something soft, what feels like a cool cloth resting on his forehead. For a moment, he doesn\u2019t remember what happened or where he is. He thinks, at first, that he\u2019s at home in bed, and has the flashing thought of </span>\n<em>\n<span>oh I\u2019m gonna be late for work.\u00a0</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>And then he remembers. Falling, fire, finding water, and then </span>\n<em>\n<span>Fire Lord Zuko.\u00a0</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Chen shoots up with a gasp, looking around wildly, </span>\n<em>\n<span>certain </span>\n</em>\n<span>that he\u2019s in a prison cell. Except, when he looks around the room he\u2019s in, he\u2019s not met with the cold and dark walls of a cell, but the warm and soft light of what he thinks is the infirmary. Chen starts when a hand enters his field of vision, catching the cloth that was indeed on his forehead.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cGood, you\u2019re awake. I was starting to get a little worried,\u201d the voice says. Chen recognizes that voice, though, and dread flows through him. </span>\n<em>\n<span>No way</span>\n</em>\n<span>, he thinks desperately, closing his eyes and trying to will the voice away. </span>\n<em>\n<span>There\u2019s no way. It can\u2019t be him.\u00a0</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Chen takes a breath and steels himself, looking to the side. Only to be met with the sight of Fire Lord Zuko sitting calmly by his bedside.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Chen wonders if Fire Lord Zuko would take mercy on him if he fainted again.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAre you feeling well?\u201d Fire Lord Zuko asks, oblivious to the turmoil happening in Chen\u2019s head. Or maybe he knows and is just torturing him more by playing dumb. \u201cI don\u2019t think you hit your head, but does it hurt?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Chen thinks Fire Lord Zuko actually sounds concerned, and it\u2019s throwing him for a loop because he should be in trouble. He should be getting punished. Why is no one yelling at him? And why hasn't Chen </span>\n<em>\n<span>said anything </span>\n</em>\n<span>yet?</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cFire Lord Zuko,\u201d Chen begins, attempting to slide off the bed so he can kneel down, but frankly he\u2019s still a bit lightheaded, so it\u2019s more of a tumble than a slide. He manages to kneel, though. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry for what happened. I\u2019m not sure how it happened, how I managed to mess up that badly, but I\u2019m so sorry. I should\u2019ve been more careful. Please, have mercy.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Chen forces himself to keep quiet and not keep repeating apologies that he\u2019s sure Fire Lord Zuko doesn\u2019t want to hear. He keeps his head lowered to the floor, not daring to look up into Fire Lord Zuko\u2019s face. He hopes he\u2019s not about to be in as much trouble as he expects.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Fire Lord Zuko sighs, and Chen cringes at the sound. When he speaks, Fire Lord Zuko\u2019s voice is\u2026 soft? Quiet? Chen\u2019s not sure but he doesn\u2019t sound angry. Disappointed maybe, and that makes Chen feel even worse.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cSit back down, please,\u201d Fire Lord Zuko says. A hand is placed gently on Chen\u2019s shoulder, and he flinches at first, before realizing the hand is simply urging him out of his kneeling position. Chen feels awkward sitting back down on the bed, but he doesn\u2019t want to disobey either. Chen shuffles to his feet, hesitantly sitting himself on the edge of the bed, ready to slip back down at a moment\u2019s notice.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cLook, Chen- uh, your name is Chen, right?\u201d Fire Lord Zuko asks once he\u2019s seated. Chen cringes once again.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYes, sir,\u201d he confirms, voice barely above a whisper.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cGreat, uh, Chen could you look at me?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Looking Fire Lord Zuko in the eye after everything he\u2019s done today is the last thing he wants to do. But again, he doesn\u2019t want to disobey either. Chen slowly raises his gaze enough to meet Fire Lord Zuko\u2019s.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI\u2019m going to make one thing very clear, here,\u201d Fire Lord Zuko says once Chen meets his gaze. His voice is solid and serious, and Chen swears all the warmth leaves his body, his hands start to shake, and he wonders if his eyes are showing how afraid he is at this moment. Fire Lord Zuko places a hand on Chen\u2019s shoulder, and Chen freezes, unable to move even if he wanted to. He\u2019s gotten into a few fights before, what young boy during wartime hasn\u2019t? But he\u2019s never fought a firebender, and this is the </span>\n<em>\n<span>Fire Lord. </span>\n</em>\n<span>If he chooses to hurt Chen right now, there\u2019s nothing he could do to defend himself.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou are </span>\n<em>\n<span>not </span>\n</em>\n<span>in trouble,\u201d comes out of Fire Lord Zuko\u2019s mouth. Chen is sure he\u2019s heard wrong.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI- What? I- I don't understand,\u201d blurts out of Chen before he can stop himself.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou are not in trouble,\u201d Fire Lord Zuko repeats. \u201cNo punishment, no consequences, nothing like that. You\u2019re not in trouble.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cBut- but</span>\n<em>\n<span> why</span>\n</em>\n<span>?\u201d he can\u2019t help but ask.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cBecause I saw you fall,\u201d Fire Lord Zuko says simply. \u201cI saw you try to fix it. I saw it was an accident.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cBut, I set a portrait of Fire Lord Sozin </span>\n<em>\n<span>on fire,</span>\n</em>\n<span>\u201d Chen doesn\u2019t know why he\u2019s arguing about this when he\u2019s just gotten out punishment free, but he\u2019s </span>\n<em>\n<span>confused. </span>\n</em>\n<span>Fire Lord Zuko looks like he\u2019s struggling to hold back a smile, for Spirit\u2019s sake, what is going on here?</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThat you did,\u201d Fire Lord Zuko says, nodding. \u201cBut you also tried to put it out, so.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cSo, I\u2019m not in trouble?\u201d Chen asks hesitantly.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNo, you\u2019re not,\u201d Fire Lord Zuko confirms with a small sort of smile.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cBesides,\u201d Fire Lord Zuko continues, standing and making his way over to a water pitcher in a corner, pouring two cups and handing one to Chen. \u201cI never like that painting anyway. You did me a favor really.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Later, when Chen leaves to go home after having a slightly mortifying and almost surreal conversation with his supervisor and Fire Lord Zuko, where the Fire Lord made clear to everyone that Chen was in no way going to be punished, the only clear thought he had was </span>\n<em>\n<span>I really wasn\u2019t expecting that.\u00a0</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Akeno never thought that anything would come from him lamenting his situation while at work. He thought maybe he\u2019d get some sympathy, or perhaps some advice from his peers.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>He\u2019d never thought the </span>\n<em>\n<span>actual Fire Lord </span>\n</em>\n<span>would hear him and offer to help.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>(In hindsight, perhaps, it\u2019s not the most outrageous thing, considering everyone seems to love Fire Lord Zuko. But at the time, Akeno had never been more surprised.)</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Akeno has only been working in the kitchens for a few months now, but he thinks he\u2019s grown close to his coworkers. He and his wife only recently moved to the capital in an attempt to find better work, and Akeno was lucky enough to snatch up one of the open positions after Fire Lord Zuko\u2026 cleaned house, so to speak.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>The smaller town they were in previously hadn't held much in terms of options. Akeno had been working in a small bakery, not the best job but also not the worst. His wife, Michi, had been mostly staying at home to take care of their children but took mending and sewing jobs occasionally for some extra money on the side.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Akeno isn\u2019t quite sure how he managed to snag this job in the first place. He\u2019s sure there were people who had more experience and expertise than him who could\u2019ve gotten the job instead. But, never one to look a gift ostrich-horse in the mouth, Akeno\u2019s not questioning it too much and intends to keep this job for as long as possible.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Unfortunately, not everything has been so easy since they moved to the capital. Their son, Taro, has had a bit of a hard time adjusting to living in such a different environment. Of course, he\u2019s only ten so some difficulties should have been expected, but he still seems to be struggling months later. Akeno had thought he might be more excited to live in a city where there are more children his age and enjoy the bustle that the capital provides, seeing as the small town they had been in before was often quiet and could be considered boring.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>It seems that he and Michi misjudged how shy Taro actually is.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>And it seems like school isn\u2019t exactly helping the matters either.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>(Actually, school seems to be the main problem, but Akeno has </span>\n<em>\n<span>no idea </span>\n</em>\n<span>how to fix that. His son is struggling and miserable, and he has no idea how to help, what kind of a father is he?)\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>And it\u2019s not like their younger daughter Minji was having the same problems. In fact, she seemed to be flourishing in the new environment, coming home every day excitedly talking about her new friends and what she learned in class. Minji, a sprite six years old, was thriving where her brother was floundering, and they had no idea what to do.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Since the town where they lived before didn\u2019t have many children, they didn\u2019t have a school. Michi had tried her best to teach the kids from home, giving them the basics of reading and writing, but they both knew that going to an actual school would be good for them. But, it seems that attending a school, and one in the capital no less, is causing Taro to struggle more than they expected.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>The poor kid hasn\u2019t seemed to have made many friends yet, probably due to the fact that the only other kid he\u2019d spent the most time with was his little sister. It didn\u2019t seem that he was completely blocking himself off from others, though, since he occasionally waved to other kids when they were at the markets. But, he never asks to go play with friends outside of school hours, or relays stories of what he and any possible friends got up to like Minji did.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>As if that wasn\u2019t enough to worry about, Taro was also having trouble academically.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>They really should have expected that, considering he\u2019d only been homeschooled before this. When they enrolled Taro in school, the headmaster assured them that they would catch Taro up to where the other kids were and help him wherever necessary.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Akeno should have known it wouldn\u2019t be that easy.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>At first, it seemed like Taro\u2019s teacher and the headmaster were helping, but it\u2019s clear now that their version of helping is not what Taro needs at all. They had started by giving him different work than the other kids in an attempt to catch him up a bit while still feeling like he was involved in class, and then had him start staying after school so he could do even more work. However, the after school work seemed to mostly just consist of giving him reading or problems to do without actually </span>\n<em>\n<span>explaining </span>\n</em>\n<span>anything. This resulted in Taro becoming ostracized from the other kids with both in classwork and anything to do with after school, and wasn\u2019t actually helping him learn.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Last month, on his and Michi\u2019s request, they stopped holding him after school and instead sent him home with the work. They didn\u2019t do it willingly, though, and his teacher kicked up a right fuss about it, but ultimately relented.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>(Akeno thinks that he\u2019s been sending Taro home with more work than normal as retaliation. Akeno kind of wants to punch Taro\u2019s teacher in the face for how he\u2019s been treating his son, but Akeno\u2019s holding back.)</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>So, they\u2019ve been trying to help Taro catch up on his own at home, trying to teach in different ways that the teacher won\u2019t. He and Michi are able to explain things to him in different ways and with different techniques that help him retain the information better, but it doesn\u2019t seem to matter much.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>(\u201cHe needs something more engaging,\u201d Akeno had told his teacher once after Taro came home nearly in tears because of another failed test. \u201cThis sitting still in a desk, reading silently, and only doing things by the book isn\u2019t helping him. He needs to be able to </span>\n<em>\n<span>see </span>\n</em>\n<span>what\u2019s happening. Physical examples, not just reading a step by step guide.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI don\u2019t see why he can\u2019t just do things this way,\u201d his teacher had argued. \u201cEvery other student does their lessons like this and they pass. Taro should be able to do it, too. He must not be trying hard enough.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201c</span>\n<em>\n<span>He is trying as hard as he can.\u201d </span>\n</em>\n<span>Akena had growled. \u201cYour methods of teaching aren\u2019t working for him. When we explain things to him at home using different methods, he understands. Then he comes here and has to do it </span>\n<em>\n<span>your way</span>\n</em>\n<span> and he can\u2019t because he doesn\u2019t understand it.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cRight, and I\u2019m sure you \u2018helping\u2019 him at home mostly consists of you giving him the answers. He does it the way I teach it, and he does it </span>\n<em>\n<span>correctly, </span>\n</em>\n<span>or he fails. Simple as that.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Akeno had tried to get Taro switched to a different class after that, but was denied.)</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI just don\u2019t know what to do,\u201d Akeno is saying to Lei, an older woman who works in the kitchens as well, while the two prep for the upcoming week. Lei doesn\u2019t have children of her own, but she\u2019s never given him bad advice before, and she\u2019s an open ear to talk to. Lei seems to be one of those older people who just happen to know everything, despite circumstances. It would be off-putting if it wasn\u2019t so helpful. \u201cNothing we\u2019re trying is really helping. He needs a different way of teaching, and his teacher just refuses to help him.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhat is his teacher saying now, my dear? It seems like that man needs to be told a thing or two,\u201d Lei says, furrowing her brow. And that is another thing Akeno likes about working with Lei, she seems like a kind old lady on the surface, but so far as Akeno\u2019s seen, she\u2019s also always ready to start a fight.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHe\u2019s threatening to send Taro back a few years, nevermind that most of these kids have really only been in school for like four years themselves. And it\u2019s not even like Taro doesn\u2019t understand things anymore, it\u2019s just that he has trouble doing it the way his teacher wants. He can do it in his own way just fine, it\u2019s just this stagnant way the teacher is doing things that\u2019s giving him trouble.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cA right shame, for someone whose pride is to educate children, to not be able to teach children in the way that benefits </span>\n<em>\n<span>them</span>\n</em>\n<span> most,\u201d Lei shakes her head.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI don\u2019t even think I can risk having another conversation with the man,\u201d Akeno says with a sigh. \u201cI lose my temper too quickly, and I don\u2019t want him to take it out on Taro more than he already has. Did I tell you he\u2019s been making Taro sit on his own away from the other kids? He says he did it so that Taro can \u2018focus without the distraction of the others\u2019. As if the poor kid didn\u2019t already have a hard enough time socializing.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cPitiful,\u201d Lei says. \u201cA person in power who takes out their shortcomings on children is just pitiful.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Akeno can\u2019t help but agree.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWe\u2019ve been trying to help him understand things in the way the teacher wants him to learn,\u201d Akeno says. \u201cBut it\u2019s difficult. It\u2019s been </span>\n<em>\n<span>years </span>\n</em>\n<span>since I\u2019ve been in school and so many things have changed since then. No wonder he doesn\u2019t get it, </span>\n<em>\n<span>I </span>\n</em>\n<span>don\u2019t even get it.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cUm, excuse me,\u201d a voice says from behind them. \u201cI don\u2019t mean to intrude, but maybe I can help?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Akeno turns, expecting to see one of the other kitchen workers, and is shocked to come face to face with Fire Lord Zuko.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cFire Lord Zuko,\u201d Akeno says in surprise. \u201cIs there something we can help you with? Do you need anything?\u201d Akeno\u2019s never even </span>\n<em>\n<span>seen </span>\n</em>\n<span>the Fire Lord, and now he\u2019s talking to him, what in the world is happening?</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOh, no I\u2019m fine,\u201d he says, waving a hand. \u201cIt\u2019s just, I overheard you talking- I didn\u2019t mean to eavesdrop! I just- I think I might be able to help you?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>If Akeno didn\u2019t know better, he would say that Fire Lord Zuko looked embarrassed. But there\u2019s no way, right? And there\u2019s no way the Fire Lord is offering to help him with his family problems, right? This has to be a trick or something. Some sort of backward punishment for talking about their personal lives while working. Right?</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>There\u2019s no way </span>\n<em>\n<span>Fire Lord Zuko </span>\n</em>\n<span>is just going around randomly offering help to the staff. </span>\n<em>\n<span>Right?\u00a0</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Akeno looks towards Lei because if any of them have probably talked to Fire Lord Zuko before, it would be her. Lei looks calm and interested, possibly a little happy. There\u2019s a glint in her eyes that Akeno has learned to recognize that comes with her being proud, and Akeno wonders what that\u2019s about. He does trust her, though, so if she doesn\u2019t look concerned about Fire Lord Zuko offering to help, then Akeno supposed he can maybe give it a chance. He\u2019ll have to test the waters first though.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI don\u2019t want to be any trouble, Fire Lord Zuko,\u201d Akeno says, bowing his head a bit. \u201cPlease, don\u2019t concern yourself with my problems. I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll be able to figure out a solution.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI really didn\u2019t mean to insert myself,\u201d Fire Lord Zuko says, lifting a hand to rub at the back of his neck. \u201cBut from what I heard, it seems that your son might have some of the same problems I had as a kid, so I wanted to maybe help. But you don\u2019t have to let me of course! Ah- I\u2019ll just be going then. Sorry.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<span>What just happened?</span>\n</em>\n<span> Akeno thinks. Fire Lord Zuko makes to leave, and yeah he definitely looks embarrassed. This entire situation feels so surreal, Akeno\u2019s not even sure it\u2019s actually happening. Lei nudges him hard in the side, bringing him back to reality. She gestures her head towards Fire Lord Zuko and raises her eyebrows.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAh, Fire Lord Zuko?\u201d Akeno calls out, hoping to stop him before he reaches the door.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYes?\u201d he asks, turning back around. Akeno might be going crazy, but he thinks the Fire Lord is avoiding eye contact.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhat advice did you have in mind?\u201d Akeno asks.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWell, not advice, actually. But maybe a solution?\u201d he says hesitantly.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOh? And what would that be?\u201d Akeno asks, intrigued.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWell\u2026\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>***</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThe Fire Lord offered to </span>\n<em>\n<span>what?</span>\n</em>\n<span>\u201d Michi whisper-shouts at him that night. It\u2019s not really late, but the kids are in bed, and when Akeno last peeked in on them, were sound asleep.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>When Akeno had gotten home from work in the late evening, Michi was still helping Taro with his take-home assignments. Minji was sitting at the table with them, seemingly having finished her own work, and was quietly coloring. Akeno had taken over helping Taro, giving his wife a break from the frustrating work. Akeno and Taro worked together for another two hours before the boy was finally finished. He was stressed, and upset, and still confused, and it just made Fire Lord Zuko\u2019s offer ring in his head a little louder.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cFire Lord Zuko offered to find Taro a tutor that could help him with school,\u201d Akeno says.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhy on earth would he do that?\u201d Michi asks incredulously. \u201cWhat\u2019s the catch? Tell me everything.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWell, I was sort of complaining about the situation to a coworker today and Fire Lord Zuko overheard us-\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou didn\u2019t get in trouble, did you?\u201d Michi interrupts, full of worry.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNo, dear, we didn\u2019t get in trouble,\u201d he assures her. \u201cIf anything, it seemed that Fire Lord Zuko felt bad for interrupting us.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d she asks.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHe seemed embarrassed and kept apologizing for involving himself. It was almost sweet,\u201d Akeno admits.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAkeno, I don\u2019t think \u2018sweet\u2019 is a word that should be used to describe the Fire Lord,\u201d Michi admonishes.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNo, really,\u201d Akeno insists. \u201cI think we\u2019re forgetting that Fire Lord or not, he\u2019s still technically a child. Barely seventeen.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Michi hums thoughtfully, not saying anything.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAnyway,\u201d Akeno continues. \u201cHe mentioned that Taro sounds a lot like how he was as a kid, and that, if we\u2019d allow it, he\u2019d ask around and see if one of his old tutors who actually helped him would be willing to help Taro.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Michi looks a little overwhelmed as she thinks it over. \u201cWe can\u2019t afford a royal tutor to help him,\u201d she says. \u201cI know we\u2019re doing better off here with both of us able to work better jobs, but there\u2019s no way we could afford that.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI- ah, might have mentioned that to him,\u201d Akena says sheepishly.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAkeno!\u201d she admonishes again.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI know, I know,\u201d he says, holding his hands up in surrender. \u201cBut I kind of wanted to see how he would react. And he said that we wouldn\u2019t have to worry about anything like that. Said, and I quote, \u2018I thought it was implied that you wouldn\u2019t have to pay for anything\u2019,\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAnd what\u2019s the catch there?\u201d Michi asks suspiciously.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHonestly? I don\u2019t think there is one,\u201d Akeno says. \u201cHe seemed genuine, and like he wanted to help. And one of my coworkers said we should give it a shot, and I trust her opinion.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI\u2019m not sure,\u201d Michi says, still hesitant. Akeno understands, he really does. He\u2019s still a bit hesitant himself, to be honest. But, Akeno hasn\u2019t heard a single horror story about Fire Lord Zuko yet, even a rumor, and he\u2019s starting to think there </span>\n<em>\n<span>won\u2019t </span>\n</em>\n<span>be any horror stories. Also\u2026\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHe also said that he could drop a hint to the headmaster to let Taro switch teachers,\u201d Akeno says, sighing. \u201cOr just speak with Taro\u2019s teacher himself. He seemed keen on that option as well.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>A laugh is startled out of Michi, and Akeno grins.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOh, did he know?\u201d she asks, still laughing.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYes, it seems like he doesn\u2019t like cruel teachers either,\u201d Akeno says.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Michi hums again, \u201cWell, I suppose we can see where this goes. Besides, it\u2019s not like he\u2019s found anyone yet.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cSo we give it a chance,\u201d Akeno agrees. \u201cSee where it takes us.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>***</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>After a few more strangely normal conversations with Fire Lord Zuko, one with Michi present as well, it seems Taro has a new tutor.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>(\u201cWell maybe you were right,\u201d Michi said the night they came home from meeting with Fire Lord Zuko.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI will treasure this moment forever, but what exactly was I right about?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOh knock it off,\u201d she says, laughing. \u201cFire Lord Zuko does seem to have good intentions.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI really think he does.\u201d)\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>The conversation about it with Taro goes much easier than they anticipated it would, as well.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou mean I get to go to the palace and learn from one of the tutors there?\u201d Taro asks, eyes wide.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWell, this first meeting will be at the palace. I\u2019m not sure about any future ones,\u201d Akeno says.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cCool,\u201d Taro breathes out.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>And that\u2019s that.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>The day comes, and Akeno walks to the palace with Taro. His son seems a little nervous, but not as much as Akeno would have expected, which he\u2019s grateful for. Akeno himself is nervous enough as is. He\u2019d wanted to stay with Taro the whole day and observe the session, which Fire Lord Zuko had agreed to let him do, but Taro had refused, saying that it would be harder to focus if he was there, too.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>They get to the palace, nodding in greeting to the guards at the front gate. Taro looks up at them in wonder, and perhaps gets a little more nervous, as he places himself firmly behind Akeno. Akeno places a hand on his shoulder, hoping to offer some comfort. At the doors, Akeno pauses, takes a deep breath, and then opens them.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>He wasn\u2019t expecting Fire Lord Zuko to meet them at the door, though.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHello,\u201d Fire Lord Zuko greets them. The woman by his side nods in greeting at them as well.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cGood morning, Fire Lord Zuko,\u201d Akeno says, trying to hide his surprise and dipping into a bow, which Taro copies, still slightly hidden behind him.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Then. Then Fire Lord Zuko then kneels down until he\u2019s at eye level with Taro.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHello, Taro,\u201d he says, and that\u2019s definitely a smile on the Fire Lord\u2019s face. \u201cI\u2019m Zuko. It\u2019s nice to meet you.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHello,\u201d Taro says back shyly. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to meet you, too.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cLet me introduce you to my friend here,\u201d Fire Lord Zuko says, gesturing behind him. \u201cThis is Shi, she\u2019s the librarian here, and she used to help me with my studies when I was younger.\u201d The woman, Shi, nods along with him.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHello, ma\u2019am,\u201d Taro says, giving another bow.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI used to be terrible with studies,\u201d Fire Lord Zuko whispers to Taro conspiratorially. \u201cShi helped me a lot. I think she\u2019ll be able to help you, too.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou were an </span>\n<em>\n<span>abysmal </span>\n</em>\n<span>student,\u201d Shi says in agreement.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHey,\u201d Fire Lord Zuko says, almost playful and Akeno realizes that he\u2019s doing this to put Taro at ease. \u201cIt\u2019s not my fault that most of this stuff is horribly boring.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Shi rolls her eyes. \u201cI\u2019m sure Taro will be a much better student than you anyway,\u201d she says.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI looked at some past assignments your father brought in,\u201d she says, this time speaking directly to Taro. \u201cYou really are quite clever, I don\u2019t know what your teacher is thinking, making you do things just the one way, but I\u2019ll help you as much as I can.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cReally?\u201d Taro asks, looking up at Shi with wide eyes. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I\u2019m clever, I can never do things right in class.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cJust because you learn differently doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re not smart,\u201d Shi says confidently. \u201cI have half a mind to give that teacher of yours a talking to.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOh, I\u2019ll be taking care of that, don\u2019t worry,\u201d Fire Lord Zuko says.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI don\u2019t want to cause any trouble, though,\u201d Taro says.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAh, you\u2019re not causing any trouble, I promise,\u201d Fire Lord Zuko says, smiling at Taro. \u201cI\u2019ve been meaning to go visit the schools to see how things are going anyway. I\u2019ll just start with your school.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNow that that\u2019s settled,\u201d Shi says. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you come with me? We\u2019ll head to the library and take a look at whatever work you have with you.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYes, ma\u2019am,\u201d Taro says, scuttling to her side but Akeno doesn\u2019t think he looks scared. Maybe a little in awe.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cDon't worry about a thing,\u201d Fire Lord Zuko says to Akeno as he watches the two walk away. \u201cShi is a kind person, and one of the only tutors I ever had that actually helped me. She\u2019ll take care of him.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThank you, Fire Lord Zuko,\u201d Akeno says, bowing once again. \u201cWe appreciate this so much more than we can express.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome,\u201d Fire Lord Zuko says after a moment of silence.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>A few hours later, when Akeno gets to the library to pick Taro up, he\u2019s met with his son practically bouncing in excitement.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHow did things go?\u201d he asks, looking from Taro to Shi.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIt was great!\u201d Taro says. \u201cThings make so much more sense the way Miss Shi explains them. And she taught me some tricks for how to do things the way Mr. Feng does.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cReally?\u201d Akeno asks, looking up at Shi. \u201cThank you.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIt was my pleasure,\u201d Shi says to Akeno. And then to Taro, \u201cI expect to see you back here soon, yes?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYes, ma\u2019am!\u201d Taro says excitedly.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>On the way home, listening to Taro happily explain how things went with Shi, Akeno has the thought: </span>\n<em>\n<span>what a pleasant surprise that was.\u00a0</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>A few weeks later, when Taro\u2019s teacher is suddenly replaced, Akeno can\u2019t find it in him to be surprised at all.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Yoshiro has seen many things in his years as a palace guard, but he has to admit the strangest thing he\u2019s seen yet is Fire Lord Zuko walking around the palace asking random staff members if they know any farmers.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Admittedly, Yoshiro isn\u2019t sure </span>\n<em>\n<span>why </span>\n</em>\n<span>exactly Fire Lord Zuko is looking for any possible farmers. He\u2019s only just started his shift, and Lord Zuko was already on his hunt when Yoshiro had shown up, and at this point, he\u2019s not sure he wants to ask.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>And until he knows why Fire Lord Zuko is looking for farmers, he\u2019s keeping the knowledge that his cousin has a farm to himself. Just to be safe.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Yoshiro\u2019s also not quite sure why Fire Lord Zuko is wandering around the palace instead of asking some of the people who work in the gardens.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cUh, Lord Zuko, sir, if I may ask a question?\u201d Yoshiro ventures.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOf course,\u201d Fire Lord says, stopping and looking at Yoshiro.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWell, I\u2019m not quite sure how long you\u2019ve been at this, or why exactly you\u2019re doing this, but have you asked the gardeners and such?\u201d Yoshiro asks.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Fire Lord Zuko stares at him for a moment in silence, just long enough for Yoshiro to start to get nervous. Then, he sighs, closing his eyes.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI\u2019m so stupid, I didn\u2019t even think about that,\u201d Fire Lord Zuko says. Yoshino thinks he might even be blushing a little. \u201cTo the gardens we go then.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Emboldened a little, Yoshiro asks, \u201cWhy exactly are you looking for farmers anyway, Lord Zuko?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOh, I had a meeting today and people want to change the budget allocated to farmers. It seems strange to me, and not very smart, but everyone kept arguing with me. So, I wanted to get some actual farmers\u2019 opinions on it, that way no one can really argue with me about whatever decision I make,\u201d he explains.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOh, well in that case, my cousin has his own farm and I\u2019m sure he\u2019d be willing to help out,\u201d Yoshiro says.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Fire Lord Zuko stops walking, slowly turning to face Yoshiro again. His eyes are slightly narrowed, but the torches lining the walls haven\u2019t swayed an inch, so Yoshiro </span>\n<em>\n<span>thinks </span>\n</em>\n<span>he\u2019s fine. Probably.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Okay, he\u2019s a little nervous.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>At least, until Fire Lord Zuko pouts at him. Like, </span>\n<em>\n<span>pouts. </span>\n</em>\n<span>Yoshiro almost pinches himself to make sure this isn\u2019t a dream.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cCan\u2019t believe you let me walk around like a fool like that for so long,\u201d Fire Lord Zuko mutters. \u201cI\u2019m going to my office. Please ask your cousin to drop by whenever he wants so I can show him the proposal. And to maybe bring some others with him.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>And with that, Fire Lord Zuko hightails it to his office, shutting the door in Yoshiro\u2019s face.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<span>Well, </span>\n</em>\n<span>he thinks, </span>\n<em>\n<span>that was surprising.\u00a0</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Yoshiro does end up speaking to his cousin, Han, about it a few days later. The only thing is, it takes a bit of convincing to get the man to agree to show up.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI\u2019m not going to the palace to speak to the Fire Lord about </span>\n<em>\n<span>anything</span>\n</em>\n<span>, Yoshiro, what in Spirit\u2019s name are you thinking?\u201d Han says incredulously when Yoshiro finally brings it up. \u201cAnd I\u2019m certainly not dragging any of my friends down with me.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOh, come on. What\u2019s the worst that can happen?\u201d Yoshiro asks. However, as soon as the question leaves his lips, he cringes, and a slew of ideas come to mind.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Han throws his hands to the air in exasperation. \u201cWell, for starters what happens if I end up disagreeing with whatever the Fire Lord wants? I could be arrested.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s very likely,\u201d Yoshiro tries to argue.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Han continues as if Yoshiro hadn\u2019t spoken. \u201cMy farm could get taken away from me-\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cActually, Fire Lord Zuko seems to appreciate farmers, so I think that\u2019s unlikely,\u201d Yoshiro tries again.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Han continues, \u201cI could get my funds taken away from me. This is the year I\u2019m not planting crops and letting the soil rest, what if he thinks my opinion isn\u2019t valid?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWell, maybe don\u2019t mention that to him, then.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhat if I say the wrong thing and piss him off? If I\u2019m not arrested I could be banished!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAgain, I think that\u2019s highly unlikely.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI have a family, Yoshiro! I can\u2019t be banished!\u201d Han continues, ignoring him. \u201cOr worse, what if we\u2019re </span>\n<em>\n<span>all </span>\n</em>\n<span>banished?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI sincerely doubt that banishing a family of five is something that Fire Lord Zuko would ever consider.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAnd bringing my friends into this as well? What if some of us agree and some of us disagree? Then we\u2019re divided!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThat is a valid concern, I suppose.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAnd what if I\u2019m punished the most because I brought those people to him? What if I\u2019m </span>\n<em>\n<span>killed</span>\n</em>\n<span>?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHan!\u201d Yoshiro interrupts harshly. Han sighs sharply, letting himself fall down limp onto the sofa. Yoshiro gingerly sits down next to him.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAlthough I genuinely believe that none of those fears would happen, I understand why it\u2019s even a fear at all. I\u2019ll tell him something so that you don\u2019t have to go,\u201d Yoshiro says gently.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Han sighs again, this time quieter. \u201cYou know we all hate that you work at the palace, right? We worry every day about you.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI know,\u201d Yoshiro says, gripping his cousin\u2019s arm.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cEspecially those last few months of- of Ozai\u2019s reign,\u201d Han continues. \u201cSo many people were getting hurt, or banished, or just </span>\n<em>\n<span>disappearing</span>\n</em>\n<span>. Every day you went back there was a gamble.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI know,\u201d Yoshiro says again. \u201cI know. I know I don\u2019t talk about it much, but those fears weren\u2019t exactly unfounded.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cCan it really be so different already?\u201d Han asks. \u201cPeople talk, but no matter how many accounts I hear, it\u2019s hard to believe that Fire Lord Zuko could really be all that different from his father.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThere is that saying \u2018the apple doesn\u2019t fall far from the tree\u2019,\u201d Yoshiro says. \u201cThough in this case, I believe that Ozai and Fire Lord Zuko are different plants entirely.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHow can you be so sure? He\u2019s only been Fire Lord for a few months.\u201d Han is looking at him curiously.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWell, he seems\u2026 gentle for one,\u201d Yoshiro starts. \u201cI\u2019ve been on his personal guard since he started, and I\u2019ve never once seen him raise his voice. And he has actual manners, which may seem like a given, but no other royal, or even semi-important person that walks through those doors seems to have manners.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Han snorts, so Yoshiro thinks at the very least he\u2019s talked his cousin down from an impending panic attack.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNot to mention, I accidentally embarrassed him the other day and he--\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou did </span>\n<em>\n<span>what?</span>\n</em>\n<span>\u201d Han asks in shock.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIt was an accident!\u201d Yoshiro defends. \u201cAnyway, you know what he did? He pouted at me, Han. </span>\n<em>\n<span>Pouted. </span>\n</em>\n<span>And then went and hid in his office for a few hours.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cSpirits, Yoshiro,\u201d Han says breathlessly. \u201cHow could you do something like that?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWell, it really was an accident,\u201d Yoshiro says plainly. \u201cI asked him why he was doing things in such a complicated way when there was a simpler option, he called himself stupid for not thinking of that first, and then took my suggestion.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAre you serious?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cVery. And to be honest, I didn\u2019t once think I was in danger.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Han sighs once again, this one sounding much more put-upon than the others. \u201cI suppose I should give him a chance then, huh? It is my livelihood on the line after all.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI don\u2019t see any harm in it, truly,\u201d Yoshiro says. \u201cAnd I\u2019m sure Fire Lord Zuko would allow me in the room as well if I asked. But, if you don\u2019t want to, there\u2019s no pressure to do so.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI\u2019ll think about it, then.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>***</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Han tells him he\u2019ll ask around and see if some other farmers would like to come with him a few days later. Yoshiro asks him if he\u2019s sure, and all Han says is, \u201cI kind of want more stories about FIre Lord Zuko, but yeah I\u2019ll ask around.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Yoshiro tells him about the time he caught Fire Lord Zuko feeding the stray cats that wander around. About the time Fire Lord Zuko started meddling in some gossip in order to get two other staff members together. About the time the Avatar landed unannounced in the middle of the caldera and gave the Fire Lord such an enthusiastic hug, that they both tumbled to the ground and the Fire Lord only laughed in response.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>With each new little story, it seems Han gets a bit more confident in going to the palace, and with each new story, more farmers agree to come. At last, Han asks Yoshiro to get a time and date that would best work for Fire Lord Zuko for all of them to come.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Yoshiro\u2019s conversation with the Fire Lord goes as such:\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cFire Lord Zuko, may I speak to you quickly?\u201d Yoshiro asks at the end of his shift the next day.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOf course,\u201d he says, looking up from his paperwork. \u201cIs everything alright?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYes, everything\u2019s fine. My cousin, the- uh farmer? He wanted me to ask you when would be a good time for them to come and see you?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOh! Oh, whenever they have the time, honestly. I\u2019d gladly drop other things to do this,\u201d Fire Lord Zuko says, not a hint of joking in his voice.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Yoshiro winces. \u201cIs this new budget really that big of a deal?\u201d he asks.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Fire Lord Zuko sighs. \u201cI don\u2019t know anymore. I think it\u2019s kind of ridiculous and more than a little stupid to want to cut the budget for the people that literally provide the food for our nation. Especially when it\u2019s looking like we\u2019ll have a bad drought this summer and need to be prepared. But some of the advisors are fighting with me on this, and it\u2019s divided enough that me making a forceful decision of my own will just cause more problems.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Fire Lord Zuko blushes suddenly, \u201cAh, I\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t mean to just- unload on you like that. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIt\u2019s not a problem, Lord Zuko, I promise. I\u2019ll tell my cousin and the people he\u2019s gathered to come as soon as possible.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThank you,\u201d Fire Lord Zuko says, all quiet now. \u201cHave a nice night.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou as well, sir.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>***</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>The Impromptu Farmer Meeting, as Yoshiro is calling it, happens just a few days later.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Yoshiro walks to work with a hoard of farmers following him (fifteen of them, Yoshiro is kind of surprised), and Yoshiro is somehow both a little embarrassed but also empowered by it. They get looks as they walk, and Yoshiro can\u2019t help but find the whole situation hilarious. Upon seeing them, the guards at the gates fully break and start laughing themselves. Yoshiro starts to explain himself, but they wave him away.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cFire Lord Zuko mentioned you would be bringing some people in soon, you\u2019re good,\u201d Ai says, still chuckling. His partner, Hachi, is leaning against his staff, trying to catch his breath. Yoshiro passes them into the palace with a sigh of his own. They make their way to Fire Lord Zuko\u2019s office, where Yoshiro assumes he is.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Yoshiro idly wonders how he\u2019ll react, since Yoshiro neglected to warn him that they were coming today.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<span>Ah, well, </span>\n</em>\n<span>he thinks. </span>\n<em>\n<span>A little surprise will be good for him.\u00a0</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Yoshiro nods in greeting to Ming and Rin, the guards currently posted outside of Fire Lord Zuko\u2019s office door. Rin, to her credit, is doing a marvelous job of keeping a straight face. Ming, however, head guard or not, isn\u2019t even bothering to try.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Yoshiro knocks on the door waiting until he hears a muffled \u201cYes?\u201d before opening the door. Yoshiro notices that Fire Lord Zuko seems to be in a somewhat heated conversation with two men adorned in military regalia. Yoshiro tries not to wrinkle his nose.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYes, Yoshiro?\u201d Fire Lord Zuko asks. His brow is furrowed and his face is tight, as if in pain. Yoshiro assumed the poor kid has a headache from whatever these men are telling him.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cPardon my interruption, Fire Lord Zuko,\u201d Yoshiro says, not really sorry at all. \u201cBut the group for your agriculture meeting is here.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Fire Lord Zuko seems to light up. He turns to the two men in front of his desk.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cGet out,\u201d he tells them. \u201cThis is going to be more interesting than you two could ever be, I guarantee.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>The two men sputter angrily, trying to argue, but Fire Lord Zuko speaks over them. \u201cMing, you wouldn\u2019t mind escorting them out, right?\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOf course, sir,\u201d Ming says, delighted. \u201cIf you\u2019ll follow me.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>The men follow Ming out, however unwillingly, glaring as they pass Yoshiro and the balking at the crown gathered just outside the doors.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThank you so much, Yoshiro,\u201d Fire Lord Zuko says, standing.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAh, don\u2019t thank me yet,\u201d Yoshiro says. \u201cYou haven\u2019t even met them yet.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Fire Lord Zuko walks to the door, opening it a bit wider. \u201cDo you want to come in, or\u2026\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>He trails off as he catches sight of the men and women standing in the hall. They stare back at him. Fire Lord Zuko looks back into his office, most definitely realizing that it\u2019s too small for everyone to fit comfortably.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cPerhaps a meeting room would be more appropriate,\u201d Fire Lord Zuko says.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYes, I think so,\u201d Yoshiro agrees. Lord Zuko grabs a stack of papers from his desk, holding them in his arms as he walks out into the hall.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cUh, hello everyone,\u201d Fire Lord Zuko says, loudly enough for everyone to hear. \u201cI\u2019m Zuko, though I guess you already know that. Um, we\u2019ll head to a meeting room down the hall so everyone can be a bit more comfortable, if that\u2019s alright with everyone?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>He\u2019s met with various nods and grunts of approval. Fire Lord Zuko nods, mumbling a \u201cRight, okay then,\u201d under his breath. \u201cAh- follow me then, please?\u201d He says louder, turning to start walking down the hall. The crowd follows him, and Yoshiro goes along, sticking by Han\u2019s side. Fire Lord Zuko hasn\u2019t told him to leave yet, so he\u2019s not going to.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Once everyone is settled into the room, Fire Lord Zuko asks if everyone would like to introduce themselves. He\u2019s met with various reactions, most of them shock, but there is some fear there as well. It takes a few moments, and a few of the braver souls coming forward first, but introductions are made. Fire Lord Zuko keeps his voice much softer than Yoshiro think s it normally is. He also doesn\u2019t sit on the raised dais at the head of the table, but instead, places himself at the same level as everyone else. Fire Lord Zuko gives everyone a few moments to orient themselves and make themselves comfortable before beginning any discussions.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Yoshiro idly wonders how many times Fire Lord Zuko has tried to make himself appear smaller so as not to frighten anyone.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cSo,\u201d Fire Lord Zuko starts. \u201cI\u2019m not sure how much Yoshiro or Han have told you about this, though granted, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve explained much either. Well, um, basically, we have the agriculture budget, right? It encompasses how much we invest in farming and food trade and all that, and how much support we give you as farmers in the off-seasons. Essentially, this new proposal wants to cut that budget. </span>\n<em>\n<span>I </span>\n</em>\n<span>think it\u2019s bullshit, but everyone wants to argue with me, so I want to know what some actual farmers think about it. I have the papers if you\u2019d like to read them yourselves.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>As soon as Fire Lord Zuko finishes speaking, there are various reactions of outrage from around the room. From annoyed mutterings to frustrated sighs to scoffs of offense.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cMay I read the papers, Lord Zuko?\u201d Han asks in a moment of bravery.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOf course,\u201d Fire Lord Zuko says, already handing the documents over. Han reads in silence for a while before huffing out an irritated breath.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but a proposal like this would absolutely ruin us,\u201d Han says plainly. He hands the papers off to the woman sitting next to him to also read. The documents make their way around the table as Han keeps speaking.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOur budget is already small enough as it is. I understand that you\u2019ve cut the military budget significantly since the end of the war, and as wonderful as that is, it hasn\u2019t really done much to help us. And this proposal wants to cut our budget practically in half.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIt would really hurt us,\u201d May, one of the others, says. \u201cWe would most likely lose a lot of farmers, and that would drastically affect us as a nation.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>One by one, various others also speak up, voicing their opinions on the matter. The unanimous decision is that the new plan sucks and the current plan isn\u2019t even all that good, so that\u2019s saying something.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>For a group of people who were afraid to even say their names, they sure do get vocal when their livelihoods are on the line.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cSo what I\u2019m gathering here is don\u2019t lower the budget, but increase it instead,\u201d Fire Lord Zuko says. He\u2019s been listening to everyone speak for what Yoshiro assumes is at least an hour by now, and hasn\u2019t really said a word until now. The only times he\u2019s spoken thus far were to clarify something on the documents.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWell, ideally, yes,\u201d Han agrees.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cPerfect,\u201d Fire Lord Zuko says. \u201cI\u2019ll work out a new budget and try to get it passed as soon as possible.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWill you really be able to do that?\u201d someone else asks.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIt might be difficult and take some time, but yes, I\u2019ll be able to,\u201d Fire Lord Zuko confirms.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>After a few more questions, it seems that no one has anything else to say. Fire Lord Zuko walks them all to the gates, thanking them once more for coming. He waits until they\u2019re all out of sight, to turn to Yoshiro and say with a raised brow, \u201cAnd you should probably go to your assigned post now, don\u2019t you think? Just use me as an excuse, I\u2019m sure you won\u2019t get in any trouble with a supervisor.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Yoshiro blushes a brilliant red, hastily bows, stutters out a thank you, and hightails it to his post.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>A few weeks later, Yoshiro is doing his rounds when he hears yelling coming from a meeting room. Curious, Yoshiro inches closer to the door.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cBecause </span>\n<em>\n<span>my people </span>\n</em>\n<span>have spoken, and told me what they want. I don\u2019t care anymore what your \u2018new budget\u2019 says. I care about what my people say when their entire lives are at stake with this new plan. I\u2019m much more inclined to listen to the people who this actually affects instead of the people that won\u2019t be affected at all,\u201d Yoshiro hears Fire Lord Zuko saying. Or, yelling, rather.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Yoshiro walks away before he can hear any of the responses, fighting to keep a smug smile off his face.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>A month later, when a new budget is approved in favor of the farmers, the only thing Yoshiro can bring himself to be surprised about is how quickly Fire Lord Zuko got it done.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Emi and Hikaru are relatively new guards. Emi has been working in the palace for a little bit longer than Hikaru, but not much. After their introductory weeks, and then a few months of working with a more experienced guard at their sides, they\u2019re both finally allowed on their own. Well, they\u2019re partners, but the point is they no longer have other guards and supervisors breathing down their necks.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>But also, they\u2019ve both been working as palace guards for less than a year. Which begs the question:</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>How in the Spirit\u2019s name did they end up guarding </span>\n<em>\n<span>the Fire Lord </span>\n</em>\n<span>for a day?</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>In theory, Emi knows how it happened. She and Hikaru had been making their rounds when they heard a sound coming from one of the less used passageways. They went to investigate, on high alert for an intruder, only to be met with the sight of Fire Lord Zuko wearing civilian clothes and attempting to sneak out of the palace. He knew he was caught, because as soon as Hikaru pushed the door open and Emi rushed forward, a fireball in hand to light the dark passageway, Fire Lord Zuko simply sighed and let his head drop.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI was so close,\u201d he mumbled. Emi is pretty sure he hadn\u2019t meant for them to hear that.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cUh,\u201d Emi had drawn out, not sure what to say. \u201cWhat are you doing here, Lord Zuko?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI don\u2019t suppose you\u2019ll just let me keep going alone, would you?\u201d he had asked plainly.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cGo alone? Go where alone?\u201d Emi asked in shock. \u201cOf course not! It\u2019s not safe!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Fire Lord Zuko had sighed again. \u201cAlright then. I guess we\u2019re going on a walk. Outside. Like, through the town. Come on.\u201d Fire Lord Zuko gestured for them to follow him as he continued walking down the passageway. Emi and Hikaru shared a look, but they followed nonetheless.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Which is how Emi found herself walking with her fellow guard and </span>\n<em>\n<span>Fire Lord Zuko </span>\n</em>\n<span>through the city.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>What even is her life?</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>In an attempt at disguising himself, Fire Lord Zuko had left behind the more royal clothes, opting instead for a simple red tunic. Perhaps that may have been enough to not cause immediate suspicion of anyone who saw them, he had also left his hair down. Just long enough to reach the top of his shoulders, it did a wonderful job of mostly hiding his face.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>There was enough bustle around the city that not many people stopped to look at them. A few people did a double-take, seeing two people in military armor walking with a teenager, but Emi supposes most of them come to the conclusion that Fire Lord Zuko is simply the son of a rich aristocrat and not </span>\n<em>\n<span>The Fire Lord</span>\n</em>\n<span>.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>They walk for some time without speaking, which Emi is fine with since she doesn\u2019t know the first thing she would say. Emi has been in the military for quite some time now, since she was seventeen. Now at twenty-four, she\u2019s seen and dealt with many atrocities. She might not have balked in fear at being offered a guard position at the palace as some others may have, but that didn\u2019t mean she was clueless. She still had a healthy dose of wariness to her. She\u2019s heard horror story after horror story of what Fire Lord\u2019s are capable of. She knows that working in close proximity to one is dangerous, and she should be on her guard at all times. Not just because of her job as a guard, but just in case those in power decide to take their anger out on others.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Granted, none of those rumors have surrounded Fire Lord Zuko himself, but Emi knows he\u2019s not as good and gentle as he may seem. She knows Fire Lord Zuko has earned his title, not by virtue of being the last one alive and healthy, but because he </span>\n<em>\n<span>won it. </span>\n</em>\n<span>She\u2019s heard the rumors of the fight between him and Princess Azula. She\u2019s heard the rumors that he was able to fend off Fire Lord Ozai\u2019s legendary lightning strikes. She knows that he is the one who taught Avatar Aang firebending and helped plan the final battle on the day of Sozin\u2019s Comet.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>So she knows, logically, that Fire Lord Zuko is plenty capable of fighting and coming out on top. She knows he has a temper, she\u2019s witnessed him yelling at enough officials to know the young man has a strong set of lungs on him. She knows who his father is, who his uncle is, what his family lineage is. Knows that he\u2019s capable of powerful things.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>The only thing is, Emi is having a hard time connecting that knowledge to the figure in front of her, who is stopping </span>\n<em>\n<span>once again </span>\n</em>\n<span>to feed a stray with food he must have snuck out with him.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Emi almost wonders if she should be suspicious. If this is some kind of test to see if he can get them to be unprofessional around him. If they\u2019ll let their guards down when they\u2019re supposed to be guarding him.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Well, Emi doesn\u2019t plan on losing this job anytime soon. Regardless of the risk factor, and minus the occasional assassination attempt that happens, this is the most cushiony job she\u2019s ever had. Plus, the pay is pretty damn good. There\u2019s no way she\u2019s messing this up, no matter how cute the cat in front of them currently is.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Hikaru, however, does not seem to have the same reservations as her. He kneels down next to Fire Lord Zuko, petting the cat along with him without a care in the world. Emi tries to remember Hikaru\u2019s credentials, knows he was in the navy, but she can\u2019t recall much else. Emi suspects he hasn\u2019t really been around a strict supervisor before.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cEmi,\u201d Hikaru says in awe. \u201cYou have to pet this cat. It\u2019s so soft.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d Emi says, keeping her distance and looking around them.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cBut Emi,\u201d Hikaru whines. </span>\n<em>\n<span>Whines</span>\n</em>\n<span>, for Spirit\u2019s sake. \u201cIt\u2019s so soft and pretty.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI\u2019m allergic.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNo, you\u2019re not!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWell, I don\u2019t want to touch the stray cat. It could have a disease, you know.\u201d As soon as Emi says that, the thought really hits her and she says, \u201cActually, that\u2019s a fair point. Lord Zuko, you shouldn\u2019t--\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI think I can decide which animals to pet and which to not, Emi,\u201d Fire Lord Zuko interrupts her. \u201cAnd please don\u2019t call me that out here. I\u2019m trying not to be noticed, ya know?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Regardless of his words, Fire Lord Zuko stands fully, brushing his hands of fur and crumbs. \u201cI guess we can keep going though. It\u2019s kind of warm today, would either of you like a drink? I can\u2019t imagine you\u2019re very comfortable in your armor.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNo, thank you,\u201d Emi says at the same time Hikaru says, \u201cSure, thanks.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Emi feels her eyebrow twitch.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Maybe she\u2019s just being overly paranoid, she thinks as she follows Fire Lord Zuko to a stall a bit down the road. He\u2019s having a quiet conversation with Hikaru about </span>\n<em>\n<span>animals </span>\n</em>\n<span>of all things. Fire Lord Zuko looks calm and content, his shoulders are relaxed, and his body isn\u2019t holding any tension, compared to earlier when they left and he looks as tightly strung as a coil. He\u2019s walking freely, and though Emi does notice he keeps a watchful eye on his surroundings, he\u2019s mostly moving without care. His steps are light, arms swaying as he walks, and Emi spies a small smile on his face as he talks with Hikaru.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>He looks relaxed, and Emi thinks she may be overreacting just a bit.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>(Can you really blame her though? She\u2019s been surrounded by violence since she was old enough to bend, she doesn\u2019t think acting cautious around the Fire Lord is a bad thing.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Maybe there\u2019s a middle ground, though.)</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>At the stall, Emi stays a few paces back, keeping an eye on the street while Hikaru stands next to Fire Lord Zuko. Emi assumes they\u2019ll return with drinks of water, seeing as it is warmer today than usual. She doesn\u2019t want to admit it, but she </span>\n<em>\n<span>is </span>\n</em>\n<span>sweating a bit unpleasantly in the armor.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>She most definitely isn\u2019t expecting Fire Lord Zuko to hand her a cup of shaved ice upon his return.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Emi stares for a moment, looking between Fire Lord Zuko and Hikaru, who\u2019s already enjoying his own treat. Fire Lord Zuko simply keeps holding out the cup, an inviting smile on his face.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Slowly, Emi takes it. She hasn\u2019t had one of these since she was a little girl. Her mother always told her they were an indulgence, a special treat for small children on blistering hot days, and Emi grew up with that mindset. It\u2019s an expensive treat, certainly not an everyday one, and for a moment, Emi feels a little embarrassed for having accepted such it without so much as a token protest.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThank you, Fire--\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAh, nope,\u201d Fire Lord Zuko interrupts her. Right, he\u2019s already told her not to call him that.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cUm, thank you, Zu- Zu-. Ah, thank you, sir,\u201d she eventually stutters out, unable to call him only by his name.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cClose enough, I suppose,\u201d he says anyway, shooting her a smile. \u201cWe\u2019ll work on it.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>As Emi eats her treat and follows alongside Fire Lord Zuko, she thinks;</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<span>This has certainly been a surprise.\u00a0</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Choi and Minji have a plan, an idea, an </span>\n<em>\n<span>adventure </span>\n</em>\n<span>complete</span>\n<em>\n<span>.\u00a0</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Now, if only the boys would stop being babies about it.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Who cares if Choi is only eight and Minji is only six? Both Taro and Liu are </span>\n<em>\n<span>ten </span>\n</em>\n<span>so it should balance out. Besides, Choi didn\u2019t go through all the work of figuring out which kids in her school also had parents or relatives that worked in the palace for her plan to </span>\n<em>\n<span>not </span>\n</em>\n<span>go through because </span>\n<em>\n<span>the boys </span>\n</em>\n<span>were scared. At least Minji is on her side.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201c</span>\n<em>\n<span>Come on</span>\n</em>\n<span>, guys,\u201d she whines to them during one of their outside breaks. Choi has the four of them gathered around a table. Liu is sitting on top of the table, because apparently, this is cooler than sitting </span>\n<em>\n<span>at </span>\n</em>\n<span>the table. Taro is sitting next to him, but on a seat, and Minji and Choi are standing as they argue their case. \u201cThis can totally work! We just need to commit!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cCommit what?\u201d Liu asks. \u201cA crime? Because that\u2019s what you want us to do!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIt\u2019s not that bad,\u201d Choi insists.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIf we get caught, we could get in a lot of trouble,\u201d Taro says, looking around to see if anyone else is listening to them. \u201cOr our parents could get in trouble, and what then?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Choi knows no one is paying them any attention, she\u2019s done her research. Taro, despite being very nice and sweet, doesn\u2019t seem to have many friends. More people have been talking to him lately, and it really bothers Choi that she doesn\u2019t know what changed. Something with his teacher, she thinks. And even though Liu is really cool and people like him, he likes to be left alone most of the time. He\u2019s a good enough firebender even at ten that people tend to listen when he tells them to leave. Choi did not, and now he\u2019s stuck with her, so there. And Minji, like her brother, is also really nice, but unlike her brother, </span>\n<em>\n<span>does </span>\n</em>\n<span>have a lot of friends. It was a bit difficult to get Minji alone, but once she heard Choi\u2019s plan, she\u2019s stuck to her like glue.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Choi does have her own friend group that she\u2019s been ignoring these past few weeks, but Choi </span>\n<em>\n<span>knows </span>\n</em>\n<span>her plan is all going to be worth it. She\u2019s been planning this for what feels like forever, and with this group of kids, she thinks they can pull it off.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Her plan is to sneak into the palace and find Fire Lord Zuko. What she\u2019ll do when they find him, she\u2019s not sure, but she wants to meet him.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>(Mom always has nice stories about it, and everyone only says good things about him. But she\u2019s never </span>\n<em>\n<span>seen </span>\n</em>\n<span>him. In-person, at least. She\u2019s seen his picture before, everyone has. But Choi thinks if everyone is going to say he\u2019s so nice and cool and a good Fire Lord, then they should at least get to see him in person!</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Besides, Taro has met him, and Choi is jealous.)</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>See, for eight-years-old, Choi thinks she\u2019s very smart for her age. Her mom says so, her teachers say so, and </span>\n<em>\n<span>she </span>\n</em>\n<span>says so. Here\u2019s the information she\u2019s gathered:</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Taro and Minji\u2019s dad works in the palace kitchen. What exactly he does in there she doesn\u2019t know and it doesn\u2019t really matter. What matters is that he works every day except for weekends from the time they start school until the evening. This means they have to make sure to steer clear of the kitchens when they sneak in so they don\u2019t run into Taro and Minji\u2019s dad.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Liu\u2019s older brother is a cleaner. From what Liu has learned, or from what he\u2019s relayed to her at least, he goes around the palace and cleans all the paintings and portraits. That admittedly makes things more difficult, since there\u2019s no way to tell where he\u2019ll be and when. This just means they have to be </span>\n<em>\n<span>extra </span>\n</em>\n<span>sneaky when they\u2019re looking for Fire Lord Zuko. If they get caught by Liu\u2019s brother, they\u2019ll definitely be kicked out.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>As for Choi, her mom works as a seamstress in the palace, so she spends most of her time in the laundry rooms. So, they just need to avoid there and they\u2019ll be fine. Now, Choi doesn\u2019t know </span>\n<em>\n<span>where </span>\n</em>\n<span>the laundry rooms are, exactly, but she doesn\u2019t think they\u2019ll be hard to avoid.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Choi has seen the palace and the gates around it before. There\u2019s a section of the gate near the back of the palace that has a small hole dug under it. It hadn\u2019t been filled the last time she checked, and she thinks no one has bothered because the only thing small enough to fit through it has been animals.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>They underestimate the tinyness of children.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>After that, all that\u2019s left to do is find a door and sneak around until they find Fire Lord Zuko. Simple, easy, and to the point. If only the boys would </span>\n<em>\n<span>agree.\u00a0</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNo one\u2019s going to get in trouble because we won\u2019t get caught,\u201d Choi insists.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cCome </span>\n<em>\n<span>on, </span>\n</em>\n<span>Taro,\u201d Minji says, bouncing closer to him and pulling his arm. \u201cThis could be fun! Besides, you said Fire Lord Zuko was really nice when you met him! Do you really think he\u2019d get mad?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIt\u2019s not </span>\n<em>\n<span>him </span>\n</em>\n<span>I\u2019m worried about,\u201d Taro says. \u201cIt\u2019s the guards, and the workers, and </span>\n<em>\n<span>everyone else. </span>\n</em>\n<span>If we manage to find Fire Lord Zuko without getting caught, I don\u2019t think he\u2019d get mad, but if anyone else finds us we\u2019ll get in a lot of trouble!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI agree with Taro,\u201d Liu says. He jumps off the table and Taro stands with him. \u201cThis is way too dangerous. What if we get hurt? What if we get caught and they think we\u2019re trying to hurt Fire Lord Zuko because we\u2019re kids and look unthreatening? People have used kids in assassination attempts before, ya know.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>When it looks like Taro and Liu are going to walk away, Choi steps in their path, pulling Minji with her.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cLiu, seriously look at me and Minji,\u201d she says. \u201cWe\u2019re </span>\n<em>\n<span>adorable. </span>\n</em>\n<span>No one\u2019s going to think we\u2019re up to no good.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Liu scoffs and rolls his eyes but Choi continues. A ten-year-old shouldn\u2019t even know </span>\n<em>\n<span>how </span>\n</em>\n<span>to scoff for Spirit\u2019s sake. \u201cPlus everyone there knows Taro. He goes there every other day and during the weekend to study. If they see us with him they\u2019ll probably just think that we\u2019re there with him to study.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Taro looks like he might be caving, and Choi should probably feel bad about pressuring him into this, but she also thinks she\u2019s being perfectly logical, so it\u2019s a toss-up. Liu doesn\u2019t look convinced yet, but he doesn\u2019t look as mad as he did a second ago. Progress.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIf we do get caught, and in the moment we don\u2019t think the studying excuse will work. I\u2019ll take the blame,\u201d Choi says.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Liu says, all suspicious. Choi rolls her eyes.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI mean, I\u2019ll tell them I needed to find my mom for an emergency and I was scared to come alone, so I made my friends come with me. I\u2019ll even cry.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Liu narrows his eyes at her. \u201cThere\u2019s no way you can cry on command.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>In response, Choi simply makes her eyes fill with tears until they brim over. She makes her lips tremble and widens her eyes, breathes faster. Liu looks at her in shock.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cSee?\u201d she says smugly, wiping her eyes before any teachers see her crying.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhoa,\u201d Minji says. \u201cCan you teach me how to do that?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cSpirit\u2019s no,\u201d Taro begs.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYeah!\u201d Choi says.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cUgh, fine,\u201d Liu groans. \u201cTaro? What do you think?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWell, if- if everyone else is gonna do it\u2026\u201d Taro begins. Choi cheers, but Liu shushes her.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI didn\u2019t ask what everyone else thinks,\u201d Liu says. \u201cI asked what you think. Hypothetically, you have the most to lose here because your dad </span>\n<em>\n<span>and </span>\n</em>\n<span>your tutor work there.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Taro groans. \u201cFine. I\u2019m nervous and a little scared, but I don\u2019t </span>\n<em>\n<span>think </span>\n</em>\n<span>we\u2019d get in trouble. Especially if we use me as an excuse for being there. It makes more sense that I would bring people to study than Choi would to find her mom.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYes!\u201d Choi and Minji both cheer. Liu rolls his eyes again, but Choi thinks he looks excited.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cTonight!\u201d Choi says.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cTonight?\u201d Liu and Taro exclaim.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cTonight!\u201d Minji agrees.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAfter school,\u201d Choi continues. \u201cWe\u2019ll go after school. None of you can change your minds if we go today.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cFine,\u201d Liu sighs. \u201cWe\u2019ll meet here at the table after school. If you\u2019re more than five minutes late I\u2019m going home.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cFine,\u201d Choi agrees.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Liu grabs Taro\u2019s arm and starts to pull him away. \u201cCome on, class is gonna start again in a few minutes. We\u2019re doing partner work today and I need a new one because that girl that was my partner only giggles.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Taro sputters as he\u2019s pulled away, but Choi doesn\u2019t care what they are saying to each other as they walk away, she\u2019s too excited.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cMinji,\u201d she says, voice an octave higher due to her excitement. \u201cThis is going to be amazing.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>***</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThis is the worst idea ever,\u201d Taro whispers as the four of them sneak up to the gate that Choi has marked as having the hole. \u201cWhat if we don\u2019t fit?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThen we make the hole bigger, duh,\u201d Choi says.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHow would we make it bigger?\u201d Minji asks. \u201cI\u2019m wearing a new tunic, I don\u2019t want to get it dirty by digging.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cMinji! You\u2019re gonna get it dirty just by crawling through the dirt,\u201d Taro says.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHuh, I guess so,\u201d Minji says, then shrugs. \u201cSo I guess it doesn\u2019t matter if I get it a little more dirty by digging.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous,\u201d Choi says. \u201cWe won\u2019t ruin your new tunic. The boys can dig instead.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Both Taro and Liu gives vaguely offended scoffs, but Choi ignores them. They\u2019re so close to their goal. They make it to the gate and Choi breathes a sigh of relief that the hole is still there. It\u2019s the same size as last time, maybe a bit bigger from the animals coming and going. Choi thinks that Minji will definitely fit, though Liu, who\u2019s the biggest out of all of them, might not.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHm,\u201d she says. \u201cI think we should maybe make it a little bigger, just so we have some wiggle room.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Taro and Liu sigh, but Choi thinks the boys have finally accepted their fate as they begin making the hole bigger. Choi shares a victorious smile with Minji.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>After the hole is significantly bigger, Choi gives the go-ahead for Minji to wiggle through. She makes it through the hole easily, coming out the other side unharmed and mostly dirt free. Choi goes next, and since she\u2019s not much bigger than Minji she gets through easily. Taro struggles a bit, having to wiggle a little more, but after some struggling, he makes it, too. Liu examines the hole again, shifting the dirt around to make it just a bit bigger on the sides. He starts to go through, making it about halfway pretty easily before he hits a snag. Taro starts digging at the sides, making more room for him to wiggle when Liu speaks.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI had a thought,\u201d Liu says, stopping his wiggling.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhat?\u201d Taro asks.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIf we\u2019re gonna use Taro as an excuse anyway if we get caught, why didn\u2019t we just </span>\n<em>\n<span>go through the front</span>\n</em>\n<span>?\u201d Taro freezes, eyes wide.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHuh,\u201d Minji says. \u201cWhy </span>\n<em>\n<span>didn\u2019t </span>\n</em>\n<span>we go through the front?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201c</span>\n<em>\n<span>Because</span>\n</em>\n<span>,\u201d Choi says. \u201cThe whole point is to </span>\n<em>\n<span>not </span>\n</em>\n<span>get caught. The excuses are just a backup plan.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThis is stupid,\u201d Liu says, continuing his wiggling finally. He makes it through without any more problems and only limited grumbling. When they\u2019re all through and have finished brushing the dirt off themselves because</span>\n<em>\n<span> they can\u2019t go into the palace dirty, what kind of first impression is that? </span>\n</em>\n<span>They start looking around for doors, only to see one right across the small garden they\u2019re in.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cPerfect,\u201d Choi says. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>***</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Zuko has just finished his meeting and is looking forward to some nice, quiet, alone time in his office when he hears a commotion down somewhere near him. He stops, and the guards that are with him hear it too because they start heading towards the noise.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cPerhaps you should stay back, Lord Zuko,\u201d Ming says. \u201cIt could be dangerous.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cMing, what kind of self-respecting assassin would be making that much noise?\u201d Zuko asks, raising an eyebrow and continuing forward.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNever listens to me,\u201d Zuko hears Ming murmur, and smirks to himself. Ming cares, and most of the time Zuko appreciates it, but it\u2019s also just too easy to rile him up. Rin is offering him empty comforts as they move along, Ming walking a little faster to be in front of Zuko. Zuko lets him have it this time.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>The closer they get to the noise, the more they can make it out. There are a few distinct voices that stand out, two maybe three of them? The voices sound harsh, like whoever it is is arguing with each other. Zuko can\u2019t quite make out what they\u2019re saying but he can definitely recognize the tones.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Ming and Rin turn the corner first, and both of them freeze. The voices stop as well.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWell, what is it?\u201d Zuko asks as he rounds the corner, only to stop himself once he sees it.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Standing in the middle of the hallway and slightly smudged with dirt, stand four kids. Two boys and two girls.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Kids.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>In the palace.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Zuko is confused.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>One of said kids is Taro, who Zuko actually recognizes, giving him some hope that someone isn\u2019t sending their kids out to try an assassination attempt. However, Taro isn\u2019t supposed to be here today, Zuko is pretty sure.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cFound him,\u201d one of the girls, the taller of the two, says, only to be immediately shushed by the boy that isn\u2019t Taro.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cUuuh,\u201d Zuko says. \u201cTaro? What\u2019s going on?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cUm-\u201d the boy stutters, looking like prey that was just cornered. Zuko immediately feels bad for the kid. \u201cUm- we- I- I brought some friends to come study?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Even if the poor kid wasn\u2019t so nervous, he\u2019s a terrible liar.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI thought you weren\u2019t supposed to be studying here today?\u201d Zuko asks.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cUm- ah- well, I forgot?\u201d he says, though it comes out sounding like a question.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cRight,\u201d Zuko sighs, taking a couple of steps forward and kneeling down in front of them. \u201cWhat\u2019s really going on? Tell me the truth, please.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>For a second, none of them say anything. Zuko looks between all of them, and all three of them seem to be looking for the older girl for answers.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>The girl sighs like she\u2019s giving, and takes a step forward from her friends. Accomplices?\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIt was my idea,\u201d she says. \u201cI had an idea to sneak into the palace and try to find you.\u201d The girl dips into a formal bow and the other kids follow suit. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Zuko tries to ignore Ming coming up to stand at his shoulder, always on guard. \u201cWhy were you trying to find me?\u201d Zuko asks.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI just wanted to meet you!\u201d the girl says. \u201cEveryone\u2019s been saying such nice things about you since you became Fire Lord, but people have hardly ever seen you. So I made a plan to see if I could find you.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Zuko blinks a few times, trying to process what he\u2019s heard. He looks to Ming and Rin who also look a bit confused.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAnd you dragged your friends along why?\u201d Zuko asks.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWell\u2026\u201d she trails off. \u201cI kind of did some\u2026 research.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cResearch?\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYeah. I figured out who went to my school who had a relative who worked here, and thought that if we worked together, we could all do it.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Zuko is well and truly blown away by now. \u201cI- I don\u2019t really know what to say. How old are you?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cEight.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cEight? I\u2019m kind of impressed, I\u2019m not gonna lie,\u201d Zuko says.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cLord Zuko!\u201d Ming chastises. \u201cDon\u2019t encourage this behavior.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cDid no one see a group of four kids sneaking into the palace?\u201d Zuko asks. \u201cIs our security that bad? Will one of you go ask around and see if anyone saw anything?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI will,\u201d Rin says, and immediately takes off. Zuko can hear her laughing from down the hall.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWell,\u201d Zuko says. \u201cYou\u2019ve come all this way, you might as well stay awhile. Wanna see my office?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cLord Zuko!\u201d Ming chastises once again.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYes!\u201d both of the girls say in excitement.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAre you upset, Fire Lord Zuko?\u201d Taro asks suddenly. \u201cAre we in trouble?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Zuko blinks in shock. \u201cNo, no one\u2019s in trouble, I promise. We\u2019ll go sit in my office for a bit, talk, and maybe have a snack. No one\u2019s in trouble.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou told us you didn\u2019t think we\u2019d get in trouble,\u201d the girl in front of Zuko says to Taro.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWell, I didn\u2019t think we would but I had to make sure!\u201d Taro says.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Zuko stops for a second, something in him softening and warming about the fact that Taro didn\u2019t think Zuko would react negatively and punish him and his friends. He knows he should probably worry about giving himself a soft reputation, but Zuko doesn\u2019t </span>\n<em>\n<span>care. </span>\n</em>\n<span>He doesn\u2019t want his people to be afraid of him, he doesn\u2019t want his staff to be afraid of him, and he certainly doesn\u2019t want </span>\n<em>\n<span>children </span>\n</em>\n<span>to be afraid of him.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Let him have a soft reputation, Zuko never wants anyone to feel about him the way people felt about his father.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cCome on,\u201d Zuko says, standing up fully. \u201cLet\u2019s go ahead and head to my office. I have a sofa in there and some chairs, so you should all be comfortable. I\u2019ll have Ming send for snacks, as well.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Ming huffs, but Zuko knows he\u2019s just as soft as Zuko himself. Taro had looked about to cry for a moment, and Zuko is willing to do whatever it takes to make sure the kid never cries.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Zuko leads the kids to his office and watches as they shuffle around to get comfortable. It seems the two girls in this group are the much bolder ones and have taken it upon themselves to explore a bit. Meanwhile, Taro and the other boy have stuck pretty closely together. Zuko knows that Taro is naturally shyer, so he\u2019s not surprised that he immediately goes to the sofa and sits in the corner. What </span>\n<em>\n<span>does </span>\n</em>\n<span>surprise him is that the other boy firmly sits himself beside Taro. Zuko hopes this means that Taro\u2019s been having an easier time in school and is making friends now that his previous teacher is out of the picture.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>If not, Zuko feels no qualms about going back to have another chat with the headmaster. He has to do a follow up with the schools anyway to make sure they\u2019re making the changes he wanted to implement, it would be all too easy to give the man another scare.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Zuko not wanting his people to be afraid of him </span>\n<em>\n<span>does not </span>\n</em>\n<span>extend to the ones that are harming others, no matter which way that may be.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Zuko takes a seat at his desk, letting the girls get their fill of exploring and snooping.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>After all, Zuko is still debating on whether to tell their parents about this. He knows he should, and he probably will, but he wants to have his own conversation with the kids first.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAlright,\u201d Zuko says, once the girls have settled down and Ming has brought in a plate of snacks. The kids all squish themselves onto the sofa, the plate of snacks settled in the middle of them.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIntroductions,\u201d Zuko continues. \u201cI\u2019m Zuko. What are your names?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>The kids introduce themselves, as Choi (the leader), Minji (Taro\u2019s little sister), and Liu (only willing to participate because Taro agreed). Zuko also manages to wrangle out of them who their relatives in the palace are. Zuko knows that Akeno is working today, and he passed Chen in the hallway earlier, so the young man should also still be here. Choi admitted that her mother was working today as well, so he\u2019ll have to send for Yuka as well.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Zuko indulges the kid\u2019s in some conversation for a while, letting them ask some questions and answering them as child-appropriately as possible. It\u2019s mostly Choi and Minji who are asking questions, but every now and then Liu or Taro will ask for more details about something.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Zuko knows he has to have a Serious Talk with the kids about this, and he knows he\u2019s losing time. The thing is, Zuko isn\u2019t sure how to go about it.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<span>Think about how to talk to kids</span>\n</em>\n<span>, Zuko tells himself, but the first thought that pops into his head is of Ozai. </span>\n<em>\n<span>Okay, scratch that</span>\n</em>\n<span>, he thinks.</span>\n<em>\n<span> How would Uncle talk to kids?</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAlright,\u201d Zuko says once most of the snacks are gone. \u201cYou all knew this was coming. Time for a serious talk and to let your families know where you are.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Zuko is met with looks of betrayal from all around, and for a brief moment, Zuko worries about how powerful these kids could be in the future. They managed to </span>\n<em>\n<span>sneak into the palace</span>\n</em>\n<span>, Zuko is sure if they stay friends they could be a force to be reckoned with when they\u2019re older.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cCome on,\u201d Zuko says. \u201cYou all knew this was coming. Don\u2019t get upset with me.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cBut you said we weren\u2019t gonna get in trouble\u201d Choi pouts.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI said </span>\n<em>\n<span>I </span>\n</em>\n<span>wasn't going to get you in trouble. I didn\u2019t say anything about not telling your families.\u201d When he\u2019s once again met with cries of betrayal, Zuko sighs. He calls Ming in and asks him to send for their family members.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cLook, let me put it this way,\u201d he says. \u201cYou four trusted me, or at least trusted your friend\u2019s opinion of me, to humor you in doing this without giving you a punishment. Your families trust me to keep their loved ones safe and protected. This includes telling them when you\u2019ve done something wrong that could have ended badly.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>When none of the kids try to argue anymore, Zuko keeps going. \u201cLook,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ve done my fair share of breaking and entering-\u201c\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou have?\u201d Taro asks, scandalized.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThat\u2019s not the point here,\u201d Zuko says, regretting this already. For Spirit\u2019s sake he\u2019s only seventeen himself, how is he supposed to lecture kids on how to behave? \u201cThe point is, this thing you four did was very dangerous. More than getting caught, you could\u2019ve gotten hurt. How do you think your families would feel if something bad happened to you because of this?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>All of the kids are looking down in various levels of shame. Zuko must actually be turning too soft because he </span>\n<em>\n<span>feels bad</span>\n</em>\n<span>, but he knows he has to have this conversation with them.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNow, while I\u2019m not getting punishing you for this, I do have some expectations, understand?\u201d Zuko continues. \u201cI expect you to not do anything like this again, okay? It was dangerous, </span>\n<em>\n<span>super </span>\n</em>\n<span>dangerous, to try and break into the palace. You\u2019re lucky none of you got hurt or got into big trouble. But, if you decide to make breaking and entering a hobby of yours, it\u2019s going to have consequences.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI\u2019m not saying that I expect you guys to,\u201d Zuko says in response to their horrified looks. \u201cBut not everyone will be as kind to you as I am here. And if you do this again, you\u2019re risking getting in serious trouble or getting seriously hurt, </span>\n<em>\n<span>or both. </span>\n</em>\n<span>\u00a0Do I have a promise from you all to not do this again?\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>The kids all give him quick and enthusiastic \u2018yes\u2019s, nodding frantically.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cGreat!\u201d Zuko says. \u201cBecause I\u2019m pretty sure your parents and your brother are almost here.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>The kids gasp in horror, and Zuko only revels in it a little, he swears.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Sure enough, sooner rather than later, there\u2019s a knock on Zuko\u2019s office door. Zuko stands to open the door himself, though he does move out of the way of the angry parents that come through the doors.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cUm, hi,\u201d Zuko says, painfully awkward.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYoung lady,\u201d Choi\u2019s mother Yuka says, coming to stand in front of her daughter. \u201cJust what in the world were you thinking?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAnd I\u2019m very disappointed in you two,\u201d Akeno says, hands on his hips. \u201cHow am I supposed to explain this to your mother?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOh Spirit\u2019s,\u201d Chen says. \u201cI have to tell </span>\n<em>\n<span>our mother </span>\n</em>\n<span>about this, Liu! How am I gonna tell her?\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWell, you don\u2019t really </span>\n<em>\n<span>have to </span>\n</em>\n<span>tell her, do you?\u201d Liu says, already wincing.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cLiu! I absolutely do!\u201d Chen exclaims.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWe\u2019re really sorry,\u201d Choi says sullenly. \u201cAnd Fire Lord Zuko already gave us a talking to. We won\u2019t ever do anything like this again.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWell, I tried,\u201d Zuko says to the people now looking at him. \u201cI tried to explain how dangerous this was and why to not do it again. And I\u2019m not\u2026 angry or anything like that, and they won\u2019t be getting in any trouble with me, so I hope you\u2019re not too upset with them. But, I\u2019m not a parent or anything like that, so\u2026\u201d Zuko trails off.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThank you so much for keeping them safe, Lord Zuko,\u201d Akeno says. \u201cI\u2019m sure you had better things to do than deal with our kids.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYes,\u201d Chen agrees. \u201cThank you. I\u2019m sure you were busy, it was kind of you to stay with them.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWell, this is my job isn\u2019t it?\u201d Zuko says, a little thrown off by the somewhat blase attitudes. \u201cTo keep my people safe and take care of them.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAnd you do a wonderful job at it,\u201d Yuka says, nodding once at him. \u201cNow, if you don\u2019t mind, I think I\u2019ll take my daughter home now.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI suppose I should take the kids home as well,\u201d Akeno agrees. \u201cI hope you two are thinking of ways to explain this to your mother.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cCan\u2019t believe I have to explain this to our parents,\u201d Chen mutters. \u201cThis is gonna be a nightmare.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNow, I want you to apologize to Fire Lord Zuko for disturbing him. I can\u2019t believe you snuck in here just to bother the Fire Lord. He has many important things to be doing, you know,\u201d Yuka says.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Properly chastised, the kids all stand, once again dipping into bows, hands folded in front of them, and say, \u201cWe\u2019re sorry, Fire Lord Zuko.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Zuko can\u2019t help the small smile that takes over his face. \u201cApology accepted.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>One by one, the kids leave, still being lectured to varying degrees. Slowly, Zuko sits back down at his desk. It feels too quiet now that the chatter of the kids is gone.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p><br>\n<span>As he pulls a stack of paperwork forward, all Zuko can think is, </span>\n<em>\n<span>that was kind of a nice surprise.</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>"
