  "text": "<p class=\"p1\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\"> Lan Sizhui remembers coming to Gusu, though he\u2019s never told anyone about it. The memory itself is unmoored, disconnected from his first life in the mounds and his second life in the clouds, and since he\u2019s never asked Lan Wangji or Lan Xichen or anyone else who was there, he\u2019s never known for sure whether what he remembers is real or made strange by a child\u2019s fevered imagination. </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\"> The memory starts with footsteps - the rushed sound of boots thudding over wood, the clatter of a door thrown open. The weight of his own body, crawling with fever, sticky and grimy and soiled, and tightly held.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\"> \u201cWangji!\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\"> More than the fever, more than how it hurts when the person holding him is shaken, and him too by proxy, it\u2019s the terror in that voice that makes him cry.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">The last thing Brother Xian said was, \u201cBe brave, and be quiet,\u201d and A-Yuan had been both, had stayed still and silent in the sour-smelling tree, covering his face with his hands to help him hide better, as the whole world became very loud and then very, very quiet, and stayed quiet for a long time. He has been swallowing his tears for days, as full of tears as fever, and though he tries to stay brave they just keep pouring out.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">The crying makes the shaking stop. It brings silence where the only sound is crying and the fast, ragged heartbeat pressed against A-Yuan\u2019s ear.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cWangji?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">The second time it\u2019s barely more than a breath of air. Careful hands unearth A-Yuan from the cradle of arms and the robe wrapped around him. They pry his little fingers away from the long, sweat-matted hair and the ribbon threaded between them. They pull him away, into candlelight and a room he\u2019s never seen before, and all above him are a crowd of faces he\u2019s never seen before, and no matter how hard he looks he doesn\u2019t see Granny or Brother Xian or Sister A-Qing or Uncle Four or Brother Ning among them, not anywhere. </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\"> He might have cried forever, if a hand hadn\u2019t reached out and settled warm against his belly, clumsily patting at him. He looks at the hand first, which is glowing blue, and then at the person it belongs to, who A-Yuan doesn\u2019t recognize until he does: until he sees that it\u2019s Brother Rich, whose face is red and sweaty and covered in dirt, whose pretty robes are smeared with dirt too. He smells like the dark pool in the back of Brother Xian\u2019s house, and he looks more like a corpse than a person. A-Yuan stops crying in surprise. </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\"> \u201cWangji,\u201d someone says again, and A-Yuan thinks for the first time of looking up and seeing who\u2019s holding him. He looks like Brother Rich, except that his eyes are dark like A-Yuan\u2019s, and he doesn\u2019t look like a corpse at all. \u201cWangji, whose child is this?\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\"> When Brother Rich says nothing, the other looks down at A-Yuan and asks, \u201cWhose child are you?\u201d and A-Yuan says nothing to that too, because he doesn\u2019t know. On the mound he was everyone\u2019s child. </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\"> \u201cAre you sick?\u201d A-Yuan asks Brother Rich, instead.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\"> When Brother Rich says nothing, the other sighs and says, \u201cHe is sick. You are both very sick.\u201d And then he turns to the pale faces huddled around them and says to one, \u201cPlease go fetch the doctor,\u201d and to another, \u201cPlease tell my uncle,\u201d and to the others, \u201cPlease go, and say nothing to anyone for now.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\"> The other people go away. The doors slide closed behind them. The man adjusts his hold on A-Yuan, enough to curl one long hand around Brother Rich\u2019s wrist and pull it gently away from A-Yuan. The blue light flickers out like a candle. </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\"> \u201cWangji,\u201d the other sighs. \u201cWhat have you done?\u201d He stands, with A-Yuan in his arms. From up high the room swims into focus. The round windows, the cloud paintings. The silks that drip from the walls like fog. They\u2019d all been sitting on the ground next to a big wooden bed. Brother Rich is leaned up against it, like he\u2019d tried to sit and fell instead. His chest heaves up and down. His eyes follow A-Yuan\u2019s as the other sets A-Yuan sniffling down on the bed, carefully re-swaddling him in the sweet-smelling robe.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\"> The other kneels down next to Brother Rich. He touches his long hair and says, just as carefully and softly as he\u2019d carried A-Yuan, \u201cYou keep nothing for yourself, do you, didi?\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">He pulls Brother Rich up onto the bed as well. This time Brother Rich is the one who makes noise: a long, terrible groan that makes A-Yuan yank the edge of the robe up over his face in fright. The whole of his back is wet and covered in red, and when he is flat on his stomach the smell of Brother Xian\u2019s dark pool is strong and home-like. His eyes are very pale in the candlelight. Later, when he\u2019s older, it\u2019s this that A-Yuan will remember most: the stretch of silence, the two of them both dirty and shaking with fever, as he looked at Brother Rich, and Brother Rich looked back at him. </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\"> Brother Rich tugs free the sleeve of the robe he\u2019d taken off and wrapped around A-Yuan, back on the mounds. It\u2019s very warm, a blue so pale it\u2019s almost the color of clouds, cleaner than any other part of them. He uses it to carefully brush away the tears on A-Yuan\u2019s cheeks. He holds it up to A-Yuan\u2019s sticky nose, and keeps it steady while A-Yuan, well-trained by Granny, blows into it. He folds the dirty fabric in on itself, tucks it carefully away from their hands and faces. </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\"> Brother Rich tells A-Yuan, low and gravelly, \u201cI am here.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\"> After a while, A-Yuan tucks his chin into his chest and nods. Brother Rich nods back, very seriously. Brother Rich\u2019s brother has stepped away, gone to stand next to the door to see if the doctor is coming yet, so it\u2019s just the two of them, watching each other closely, waiting to see what will happen next. </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\"> \u201cI am here,\u201d Brother Rich repeats, even though now he\u2019s the one with tears running down his cheeks, and A-Yuan the one who stretches out his small hands to wipe them away.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p2\" align=\"center\">\n<span class=\"s1\">-</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">As for what happened next, Lan Sizhui only knows what he is told. That Hanguang Jun did not always look after him; that Hanguang Jun was in seclusion when he was very young. Of course the elders would not let Lan Wangji keep the child he\u2019d appeared with so suddenly, both of them covered in blood and gravedirt - not after he refused to tell them whose child this was, no matter how obvious the answer might have been, and not after his panicked flight to Yiling brought him closer to death than the whips by themselves had. For months afterwards he lingered at the bank of that long river, drifting on the currents, unable to walk or sit up or, truly, to wake or sleep. Both Lan Wangji\u2019s memories and Lan Sizhui\u2019s memories of those in-between times have only really ever been fragments. </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\"> By the time the fever left them both, A-Yuan had been given over to the care of others: Grannies who looked after the Lan clan\u2019s children while their parents were elsewhere. But no one had told these venerable ladies that this boy had been saved from a killing field, that everyone he\u2019d ever known was dead - and there were so many other children to care for. No one in Cloud Recesses knew that this quiet, morose child had been so free with his smiles and laughter back home in the mounds. There was no one left alive except for Lan Wangji to tell them otherwise. When A-Yuan asked for his own Granny and Brother Xian and Sister A-Qing and Uncle Four and Uncle Six, they shook him off their skirts and told him to go play with the other children. In the clouds, A-Yuan was no one\u2019s child. So he grew more quiet, and more morose, and instead of playing he hit and bit and cried, which is what happens when Lan Wangji finally reappears in his life.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\"> Granny Two brings A-Yuan to a little house that sits on the edge of the clouds, where the white buildings grow thin and the bamboo grows thick and the mountain starts to tumble back down to earth. The little house is locked away behind a thick fence, with a garden full of white stones and a long wooden deck and endless white-papered doors that look like watching eyes, or the barriers that Brother Xian would set around the places A-Yuan was forbidden to go. But he\u2019s already started to forget about that - the edges and details of Brother Xian\u2019s cave have grown dim on the other side of his fever - and all he really knows is that the little house looks like a place A-Yuan is not welcome. </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\"> He tugs his arm away from Granny Two\u2019s hand before they can go up the low steps to the little house, to the man in white who sits straight-backed on the long deck, so still that at first A-Yuan hadn\u2019t seen him at all. There\u2019s a second cushion next to him, and a table with food set out in covered jars and lacquered trays. A-Yuan can smell the food, and his stomach fights him even as he crouches behind one of the big stone lamps and hides. He can hear Granny Two and Brother Rich speaking, and then Granny Two shuffles back down the stairs. She hisses at him as she passes, says: \u201cYou behave for Second Master Lan,\u201d and then she\u2019s gone. </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\"> A-Yuan stays where he is, scowling. His hands wrap around his knees. He watches the ants crawl back and forth under his feet. He listens to the wind rattle the bamboo around. Maybe he could run away into the forest. His feet know the slope of a mountain, and he thinks from here he could find the cave and his home and all of his family. He could go home. His stomach gurgles again.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\"> Brother Rich kneels down next to A-Yuan. His white robes spread across the white stone and his face, too, is white, even his mouth, like he has no blood in him at all. He made no noise coming closer, and he is very large and very scary looking, so of course A-Yuan jerks away. Brother Rich, eyes wide, snatches his wrist to keep him upright, which makes A-Yuan yell, and in answering surprise Brother RIch lets him go, and A-Yuan falls down. His butt hits the ground; his head hits the stone lamp. For a second he doesn\u2019t cry, and Brother Rich stares down at him in open shock, and then A-Yuan opens his mouth and starts to howl. It\u2019s the sort of crying that\u2019s terrifying to people who aren\u2019t used to children. Great, heart-rending sobs, too big and loud for the small chest they come from. </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\"> Lan Wangji is not used to children, and his heart - just barely stitched together - is torn to pieces again. His hand dangles uselessly in the air. He can see that A-Yuan is not really hurt - his palms aren\u2019t scraped, his clothes not torn. Lan Wangji\u2019s fingers, when he remembers he has them, find not even a bump on the small head. But still A-Yuan cries, loud enough to break the clouds.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\"> Lan Wangji\u2019s hands curl and soften, finally, and move to hold A-Yuan, but then A-Yuan sobs, \u201cBrother Xian!\u201d and - heaven help him - Lan Wangji looks. The motion is automatic: he always looks, he always <em>will</em> look. The day he\u2019d met A-Yuan his eyes scanned the crowd for rescue to swoop in on black and red wings, even before he\u2019d known who A-Yuan belonged to. But the forest and the Jingshi are as empty as they always are, as they always have been. </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">For a moment it\u2019s as if the whips are striking him again. For a moment he is fiercely, hungrily jealous of the way A-Yuan can cry. And then A-Yuan pushes him away, as hard as his little arms can, and kicks him too, in case it wasn\u2019t enough.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">It rocks Lan Wangji back on his heels, but not from the force of it. </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\"><em>No one is coming</em>, he wants to tell A-Yuan. But A-Yuan must already know this. The child had already lost everything there was for a person to lose, over and over. If he were Wei Ying, he would have the words to comfort A-Yuan - but even the brush of that name against his throat is enough to make him want to tear it out. </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">He pulls away. A-Yuan\u2019s yell catches halfway out of his mouth and he looks at Lan Wangji with wide eyes, suddenly terrified. Lan Wangji doesn\u2019t know that the fear in his little heart is that Brother Rich will call Granny Two, and that A-Yuan will be shuffled back to the little compound and be left to sit in corners by himself. Hiccuping, tears still streaming down his face, A-Yuan puts his arms around his own shoulders and mutters, so soft that Lan Wangji barely catches the words: \u201cGood A-Yuan, precious A-Yuan. Everything is okay,\u201d which was what Granny used to whisper to him as she rocked him in her soft arms.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Lan Wangji puts his hands under A-Yuan\u2019s arms and pulls him to his feet. He wraps a hand around A-Yuan\u2019s impossibly small one and leads him, still crying, out from behind the thick fence and away from the little house. His injuries make it nearly impossible to carry the boy. Instead he walks very, very slowly and very, very carefully, so carefully that A-Yuan never stumbles over the uneven ground, even though his eyes are shut tight with grief. Eventually the narrow path widens into a little meadow, which is dense with grass and ferns and dotted all around with small white fluffy balls, which sit up quickly as they approach.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">The crying stops. The silence is blissful, as is the thin hope of not having failed in this, as he has in everything else.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">He can tell at once that A-Yuan has never seen a rabbit before. He\u2019s sure that if one had come within a li of the Burial Mounds it would have been gobbled right up. Lan Wangji saw, too, the Wen detention camp with his own eyes: there were no animals there at all. Lan Wangji may as well have taken his hand and walked them to the surface of the moon. </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">A-Yuan allows Lan Wangji to seat him on the ground, and then kneel next to him. The rabbits, in color and substance like the mist that drifts through the mountains, circle around them and shake their long ears. As soon as one gets close, Lan Wangji picks it up and gives it to A-Yuan. He puts three in A-Yuan\u2019s small hands, four or five more in his lap, and balances a particularly docile one on his head. The rabbits, of course, don\u2019t stay still but wiggle their soft paws up onto his arms and shoulders. They balance on his knees and press their twitching noses to his. Even a jade statue would start to giggle under such an assault, or feel his heart lighten to watch it.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cBe gentle,\u201d he tells A-Yuan, with a voice as soft as rabbits\u2019 fur. \u201cPet with the back of your hand.\u201d And he demonstrates, the rabbit happily shutting its eyes under his touch. </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cOh,\u201d A-Yuan breathes. He is gentle, without having to be told twice, and the rabbits settle down into a furry blanket on his still, thrilled lap. His tears dry on his cheeks and beside him, unnoticed, Lan Wangji\u2019s panicked heartbeats slow to their usual pace. </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Lan Wangji says, hesitantly, \u201cGood A-Yuan. Precious A-Yuan. Everything will be okay,\u201d and puts a single hand on A-Yuan\u2019s back.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">A-Yuan sighs very deeply. The rabbits tumble slowly to the forest floor as he carefully gets up, crawls into Lan Wangji\u2019s lap, and buries his face in his chest.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\"><em>Oh,</em> Lan Wangji thinks.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">He will never tell Lan Sizhui - not then, not later, not ever - that he had saved him from the Burial Mounds with no particular plan in mind. The soul he had gone to find was Wei Ying\u2019s, and anyone else\u2019s would have been incidental. His grief was so terrible that it seemed impossible to imagine that he would even continue to exist. His grief was an extension of the violence done to the rest of his body: it sickened and isolated him. The simple act of waking up, day after day, was astonishing and unfair. Wei Ying was dead - he was dead, he was <em>dead:</em> that was all that mattered. Lan Wangji had brought the child to Cloud Recesses because despite the whips, he had only ever known safety in one other place, and that place - that person - was gone. </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">He puts his arms around A-Yuan, who is so small that it almost feels like holding one of the rabbits. It hurts, of course - any movement at all pulls at the wounds on his back, as it will for many years, and indeed never fully cease. But he holds A-Yuan until the sun has chased shadows all the way across the little meadow. He holds A-Yuan until he nearly falls asleep himself. He holds A-Yuan until his wounds scream too loud to be ignored and then, regretfully, achingly, he hauls himself to his feet. </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">A-Yuan stirs in his arms. His face is hot against Lan Wangji\u2019s neck. His hand is heavy on Lan Wangji\u2019s shoulder. His little fingers curl around the shape of bandages under Lan Wangji\u2019s robes. He murmurs, still mostly asleep, \u201cA-Yuan doesn\u2019t want to go back. A-Yuan wants to stay with Brother Rich.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\"> Lan Wangji\u2019s arms tighten.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\"> Uncle hadn\u2019t asked about the boy, though of course he knew. Neither had Brother, though he had stayed faithfully by Lan Wangji\u2019s side through the worst of his sicknesses, and had even helped him take his first steps out of the Jingshi. It was lucky that one of them hadn\u2019t taken it upon themselves to rehome A-Yuan somewhere out of the Cloud Recesses entirely, before Lan Wangji could do anything about it. No one has asked him what his intentions were, and in truth he hadn\u2019t any, not until that day he\u2019d buried the boy under rabbits.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\"> \u201cYou will,\u201d he says to A-Yuan, and so he does.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p2\" align=\"center\">\n<span class=\"s1\">-</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">The first clear memory that Lan Sizhui has of living with Lan Wangji is of new robes. He never really had anything new before and the novelty of it, the specialness, never really fades from his mind. There are several sets of clothes, so even if he dirties one he doesn\u2019t have to sit naked by the river while someone cleans it, the way he used to. There are new shoes, made of leather instead of coarse straw. A small bed in one corner of the Jingshi, and a cabinet to put books and notepaper and toys. And a thin white ribbon that Brother Rich ties on his forehead every morning after he brushes A-Yuan\u2019s hair. Sometimes he still is put in the care of Grannies One, Two, and Three, but not often and not for long. Lan Wangji has a long road of recovery ahead of him and is, officially, in secluded meditation and not permitted to leave the boundaries of Cloud Recesses, for fear that he\u2019ll expose either his heresy or discipline wounds to outsiders, or come back with another wayward orphan and refuse to explain where he\u2019d gotten it.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Mostly to A-Yuan <em>secluded meditation</em> means Brother Rich doesn\u2019t go many places, and when he does he usually takes A-Yuan with him. In the morning they feed the rabbits (Brother Rich brings extra vegetables since A-Yuan will eat as many carrots as the rabbits do). In the afternoon he sits on the long deck and watches A-Yuan play. Before dinner he teaches A-Yuan to read, or positions his fingers above the guqin, showing him music his hands are too small to yet make. He still walks slowly and not for any distance, and he will never speak much. That doesn\u2019t bother A-Yuan, who absorbs attention like sunlight and care like sweet rain, and blossoms once again. </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\"> Later, when Lan Sizhui is older, he will eat almost all of his meals with other people. With his clan in the big hall during festivals and happy occasions. With the other disciples in their own little courtyard, jostling each other\u2019s elbows and laughing. Regularly, too, with Lan Wangji, even after he moves into the disciples\u2019 quarters, and later into his own rooms as a leader of the Gusu Lan - just the two of them in the little house at the edge of the woods, and he\u2019ll find the silent meals meditative and soothing, and feel settled and happy afterwards. It won\u2019t seem strange to him that they spent much of his first years in the clouds like that: alone. </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\"> If not for the efforts of Lan Xichen, his refusal to sideline his brother, they might have remained that way.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\"> One summer night, not too many months after A-Yuan has come to live at the little house at the edge of the clouds, Lan Xichen and Lan Qiren join them for dinner. They eat on the little pavilion outside where they can all feel the cool breeze rolling off the mountains, and A-Yuan can watch the fireflies playing in the grass. The meal is silent, as it always is; Brother Xichen smiles through it, and Master Lan scowls through it, as they usually do. That night there are <em>five</em> different dishes on the table, and A-Yuan has been allowed to try <em>all</em> of them, even the soup with its bitter, bitter leaves; even the meat in its thin gravy; even the bamboo although he spits out the first crunchy piece Brother Rich puts into his bowl. </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\"> \u201cDon\u2019t waste food,\u201d Master Lan snaps at A-Yuan, though he\u2019s already put the strange vegetable back in his mouth and is chewing gamely on it.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\"> \u201cImprove your posture,\u201d Master Lan orders A-Yuan, though he\u2019s been sitting very carefully too. He does his best to wiggle straighter anyway, and doesn\u2019t tell Master Lan that speech is forbidden during meals. </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cGood,\u201d Brother Rich tells A-Yuan, pointedly, and puts more food into A-Yuan\u2019s bowl before Master Lan can catch him hiding any of it in his sleeves. A-Yuan stays still and quiet and follows all the precepts he\u2019s learned so far, and when he\u2019s finished eating his reward is to lean most of his body weight against Brother Rich\u2019s arm, and play with the fine white fabric of his sleeve while the adults talk. </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\"> \u201cYou spoil him,\u201d Master Lan says.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\"> \u201cHe looks healthy,\u201d Brother Xichen says, and then to Brother Rich, \u201cThe first of the watchtowers have started construction on the Ouyang sect\u2019s lands. I have a letter from them that I\u2019d like your opinion on.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\"> Brother Rich doesn\u2019t say anything. A-Yuan drapes the long sleeve over his own knees and draws it off, bunches the fabric between his little fingers to look like white flowers, ripples it to look like rushing water.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\"> \u201cQinghe Nie will be hosting a martial arts conference next month,\u201d Brother Xichen says.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\"> \u201cOh? Will Lanling Jin be attending?\u201d Master Lan says.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\"> \u201cUncle,\u201d Brother Xichen says, chiding. \u201cA-Yao has mended his friendship with Da-ge. He visits him often in the Unclean Realm. Do not worry.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\"> Brother Rich doesn\u2019t say anything. A-Yuan sags against him, his head heavy despite the fancy of the fireflies, sparkling in and out of sight. His stomach is full and his robes are cozy warm. His fingers soften around the sleeve. He rubs his face against Brother Rich\u2019s arm.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\"> \u201cSit up straight,\u201d Master Lan snaps again.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\"> \u201cA-Yuan is young still,\u201d Brother Xichen says gently. </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\"><em> \u201cIf</em> he\u2019s to be raised here, then he\u2019ll follow the same rules as any other outside disciple,\u201d Master Lan says. \u201cOtherwise, send him down the mountain and be done with it.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\"> Brother Rich\u2019s arm has turned to stone against A-Yuan\u2019s cheek. He says, very low, \u201cHe won\u2019t be an outside disciple.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\"> The silence is very tense. A-Yuan straightens up without having to be told, rubbing at his eyes. Master Lan and Brother Xichen are frowning at Brother Rich, and then Master Lan turns to frown at A-Yuan, studying him very deeply. \u201cWhat is he wearing?\u201d he asks, sharp.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\"> Brother Rich says nothing, but it\u2019s a nothing that feels sharp all over to A-Yuan, like needles on his skin, or a blood red pool that he only barely still remembers. He tugs on Brother Rich\u2019s sleeve, and turns on a smile. \u201cA-Yuan wants to go pet the rabbits,\u201d he pleads. \u201cCan we go pet the rabbits? They\u2019re very hungry.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\"> \u201cThe rabbits are sleeping,\u201d Brother Rich tells him. He brushes one hand over A-Yuan\u2019s hair, very softly. \u201cWe will see them in the morning.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">A-Yuan whines playfully in his throat. He\u2019d been raised to tease, even if he won\u2019t remember it for a long, long time. He pushes his lower lip out for added effect. \u201cBrother Rich,\u201d he begs, but his efforts are interrupted.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cYou will address your elders <em>properly,</em>\u201d Master Lan snaps, his voice growing even sharper, sharp enough that A-Yuan feels real alarm for a moment, just until he remembers that Brother Rich is there and it will be okay. Master Lan points to Brother Rich. \u201cHe is Hanguang Jun.\u201d He points to Brother Xichen. \u201cZewu Jun.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\"> A-Yuan looks up at Brother Rich. Brother Rich looks back at him. </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\"> \u201cWe will watch the fireflies,\u201d Brother Rich decides. He picks A-Yuan up, sets him on the ground, and takes his hand to lead him away.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\"> The grass grows long on the far side of the Jingshi, away from the stone garden and the long deck that overlooks it. It\u2019s the perfect height for both fireflies and A-Yuan to hide in, and this night both of them do, dipping and dancing between the gently waving stalks. Brother Rich sits down in the grass to watch him, which is good, and he smiles as A-Yuan tries his best to catch fireflies, which is even better. But they\u2019re not so far away that A-Yuan can\u2019t hear Brother Xichen and Master Lan still arguing, in the strange, quiet way people seem to argue in the clouds.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cUncle,\u201d Brother Xichen says, \u201cdon\u2019t trouble yourself. When he starts his schooling we can discuss addressing family in public.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\"> \u201cThis child is not -\u201d Master Lan starts to say, and Brother Rich tenses, looking over his shoulder instead of at A-Yuan - but then Brother Xichen laughs. It\u2019s a good laugh, and it\u2019s comforting to A-Yuan to hear it.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\"> \u201cApologies, Uncle,\u201d Brother Xichen says, \u201cbut you saw the embroidery on his forehead ribbon. He clearly is.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\"> Brother Rich stretches out one hand and closes it around a firefly, so easy it seems like magic. A-Yuan shouts with happiness and rushes over to see the light flickering in between Brother Rich\u2019s fingers. The firefly darts around inside Brother Rich\u2019s palm, bashing against his calloused skin, and it\u2019s beautiful. After a moment he lets A-Yuan pry his fingers apart and set the light free, and then he captures another firefly so that they can repeat the process.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\"> Distracted, A-Yuan almost forgets about the argument happening on the little pavilion, but the same warm breeze that rattles the bamboo also brings Brother Xichen and Master Lan\u2019s voices to them again. \u201cWhat are you trying to achieve, doing these things?\u201d Uncle Xichen asks. </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\"> Master Lan <em>harrumphs.</em> \u201cChildren need a firm hand,\u201d he says. \u201cIf Wangji refuses to accept his responsibilities, then they will be taken away.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\"> A-Yuan looks wide-eyed at Brother Rich, who only shakes his head firmly, and sets another firefly free. \u201cI don\u2019t think he\u2019s refusing anything,\u201d Brother Xichen says. \u201cLook at them, Uncle. A-Yuan is clearly very happy here. And - I think Wangji is happy too, now.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\"> \u201cWhat does happiness have to do with it?\u201d Master Lan demands.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\"> There\u2019s a stretch of silence. A-Yuan puts his hands over his mouth to stop it from quivering. He squats down and starts pulling out long strands of grass, so that Brother Rich will weave them together to make a crown or a sword for him. He sighs deeply, this time not even meaning anything by it, his teasing finished, his sadness real. </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\"> \u201cA-Yuan?\u201d Brother Rich prompts. A-Yuan doesn\u2019t say anything for a while, but Brother Rich is better at silence than any child, other than the one he himself had been. </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Finally, A-Yuan sighs again and says, softly, \u201cHe doesn\u2019t like A-Yuan.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\"> Brother Rich looks at him. \u201cMaster Lan just doesn\u2019t like radishes,\u201d he says. He starts pulling grass himself, gathering it in a neat pile on one knee. Over the years he\u2019ll get better at teasing, and eventually he\u2019ll be good enough to confound a soul made to tease, but his efforts now are rough. \u201cWhen you first sprouted from the soil, it scared him.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\"> A-Yuan gives his handfuls of grass to Brother Rich, who accepts them solemnly and begins to weave. \u201cGusu\u2019s soil is thin,\u201d he says, after long minutes. \u201cWe\u2019re not lucky here, to grow many children only with sun and rain.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\"> \u201cJust me,\u201d A-Yuan says glumly. He knows. If there were other children like him then the grownups wouldn't wonder where A-Yuan comes from. He hears them asking sometimes, mostly when A-Yuan goes to be watched by the Grannies. It happens when they think A-Yuan cannot hear. </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\"> \u201cJust you,\u201d Brother Rich repeats, but the way he says it makes A-Yuan feel special instead of sad. He makes himself a nest in Brother Rich\u2019s lap, and forgets about his tears, and about Master Lan and Brother Xichen, who now are speaking so softly that even Lan Wangji can\u2019t hear their words.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\"> \u201cWe <em>need</em> him,\u201d Lan Qiren says to his nephew. \u201cThe war may be over but Gusu Lan is still rebuilding, Xichen. When Wangji is finished with this - this <em>tantrum</em>, he must resume his place at your side.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\"> \u201cUncle,\u201d Lan Xichen says, very faintly. \u201cHe nearly <em>died.</em>\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\"> Lan Qiren blows angry air through his nostrils. \u201cThe Yiling Patriarch is the one who died,\u201d he points out. \u201cWangji lives, so he must <em>live.</em>\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\"> Lan Xichen draws in a deep breath, and is silent for a long time. When he finally speaks, his voice is as mild as ever, belying the fact that it\u2019s the second time in his life that he\u2019s dared to argue with his uncle. \u201cOne day,\u201d<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 </span>he says slowly, \u201cyou will ask Wangji to do something he cannot.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\"> And Uncle says, firmly, \u201cThere is nothing Wangji cannot do.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\"> Cradled gently in the grass, A-Yuan looks up at Brother Rich. \u201cIs Brother Rich a bad name?\u201d he asks, curious.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\"> Brother Rich shakes his head, and places a grass crown on top of A-Yuan\u2019s head. \u201cYou may call me what you like,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen you\u2019re older, I\u2019ll give you a name too.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\"> A-Yuan is falling asleep for real this time, his eyes getting heavier and heavier. The fireflies smear across his sleepy gaze. He\u2019s rocked gently within Brother Rich\u2019s arms, mostly by accident as Brother Rich continues to weave together long tails of grass, making abstract shapes with them. \u201cBrother Zhan,\u201d he tries. Brother Rich flinches, just a little. A-Yuan opens his eyes back up, gauging the reaction. \u201cBrother Rabbit!\u201d he says, wanting to please. That one is better, and earns him a curl of Brother Rich\u2019s lips, as fast as a firefly. A-Yuan glows too. </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Cheeky, with his little heart beating fast, he says, \u201cDaddy?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\"> Brother Rich becomes very still. Snuggled close, A-Yuan doesn\u2019t see the firefly smile reappear, tucking itself like a secret into the corner of his mouth - but he can feel Brother Rich\u2019s heartbeat thudding against his ear, beating just as fast. He straightens A-Yuan\u2019s crown carefully, and tells him again, \u201cYou may call me what you like.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p2\" align=\"center\">\n<span class=\"s1\">-</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\"> Lan Sizhui turns seven or eight the year that Lan Wangji emerges from his forced seclusion. The two of them spend the years in between growing stronger, twining together like trees towards the sunlight. After the first year, Lan Sizhui can read and write as well as the other children, despite his late start. After the second, he is allowed to prove it. He takes to school like he was born to it, swallowing any scrap of knowledge given to him, and hiding the leftovers in his sleeves to puzzle over later. His posture is perfect during lessons. He is kind to his classmates and dutiful to his teachers. In public he always says Hanguang Jun, and Zewu Jun, and Master Lan. He gives no one cause to wonder whose child he is.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\"> The third year, a few days after the first snowfall of the season, Lan Wangji takes Lan Sizhui to his brother and says he has business out of Gusu, and asks if he will watch over him. He doesn\u2019t say where he\u2019s going. He doesn\u2019t say when he will be back. He doesn\u2019t say goodbye. Dubiously, Lan Sizhui and Lan Xichen look at each other, and then Xichen asks if he\u2019d like to learn how to play the xiao. </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">That night is the first night that A-Yuan and Wangji spend apart from each other in more than two years. A-Yuan sleeps poorly in the Hanshi, which is closer to the center of Cloud Recesses than the set apart home of Xichen\u2019s mother, and accordingly noisier. There are servants that bustle through the bordering courtyards. The clatter of wooden chimes in the wind. Each morning when Xichen opens his eyes, A-Yuan is already awake, curled in his blankets and playing quietly to himself with one of the little boy treasures he keeps in his sleeves: a wooden puzzle, or a grass butterfly, or a little book full of basic calligraphy. He picks over his food. He practices guqin fingering on empty tables.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\"> They feed Wangji\u2019s rabbits together, who greet disappointment each morning as they dash across the meadow to say hello and then realize all over again that Xichen is not their master. They shake their ears and kick grass at Xichen to express their feelings, and then clamber all over A-Yuan to beg for sympathy. A-Yuan brings his schoolwork so that he\u2019ll have an excuse to linger when Xichen excuses himself to see to his duties. </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\"> Wangji sends no word for five days. The silence lingers like incense as Xichen goes about his day, and hangs heavy in the Hanshi as he and Uncle and A-Yuan eat their meals. When they were younger, Wangji often disappeared for days at a time, finding himself wherever the chaos was. And of course Xichen had worried then: Wangji had been unfathomably young to be doing such things, but that was all before -<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 </span><em>before,</em> a word that feels so inadequate that all the poetry in the world could not describe the gulf of experience between Xichen and his younger self - and the worry poisons him. <em>Before,</em> he had so little idea of what evils were out there in the world for his little brother to find.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\"> Voices wake Xichen in the middle of the fifth night. A-Yuan\u2019s round face flashes pale in the dark when Xichen flies to the door, not bothering to light a candle. </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\"> \u201cIt\u2019s Hanguang Jun,\u201d the messenger says, speaking Xichen\u2019s greatest fear to life, but the words that follow undercut his terror with confusion. \u201cHe\u2019s wrecking the storeroom.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\"> The messenger wears a plain white ribbon and an expression of poorly banked disbelief - asking him <em>why is Wangji wrecking anything</em> would be pointless. \u201cI\u2019ll come,\u201d Xichen says instead. He lingers long enough to throw a robe over his sleeping clothes and to tell A-Yuan, \u201cStay here. Don\u2019t come out for any reason.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\"> At this time of night Cloud Recesses is completely silent, their footsteps swallowed up by the mist. Even the noises coming from the partially open door of the storeroom seem dream-like. \u201cGo back to your posts,\u201d Xichen tells the messenger, and another outer disciple standing guard outside the storeroom. He goes to face his brother alone.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 </span></span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\"> In the morning, Wangji will need to be told what he\u2019s done. He\u2019ll wake in the back room of the doctor\u2019s quarters, and he\u2019ll vomit onto the floor because Xichen doesn\u2019t know enough about drunkenness to have a bowl ready, or even to anticipate such a thing happening. His eyelashes will frost over and clump together with tears, because Wangji hadn\u2019t known anything about drunkenness either, and will feel a type of sick pain that he\u2019d avoided his whole life. He will sit and stare at his bare, dirty feet when Xichen describes the rules he\u2019s broken - the destruction of their clan\u2019s treasures, the two empty bottles of liquor left on the steps of the Jingshi - and the look of horror on his face will soften Xichen\u2019s retelling. He won\u2019t mention the bruise that darkens his jawline. He\u2019ll leave out that he tried to wrestle the Wen brand away from Wangji\u2019s grip, and failed. He\u2019ll never describe to anyone the smell of his brother\u2019s skin burning, not even to himself. </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\"> In the night, in that moment, the stink is inescapable. It fills the ruined storeroom as Lan Xichen stands panting over his brother\u2019s unconscious body. He stoops to pick up the brand and is sickened by his failures and also by the charred bits of skin that adhere to the iron. He rolls Wangji onto his side to see if the scars on his back have torn, if he has any other injuries. He allows himself a single moment of indulgence when he finds they have not - a few breathless, grateful seconds where he presses his forehead to his brother\u2019s shoulder and listens to the thud of his unsteady heart - before he pulls Wangji\u2019s robes closed and gathers him into his arms. </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\"> The guards have not gone to bed, nor back to their post. They hover on the edge of the lamplight with wide eyes and open ears. \u201cWake the doctor,\u201d Xichen sighs. </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\"> Lan Qiaohua receives the pair of them into her offices with surprise concealed only a little better than the outside disciples\u2019. \u201cI thought I\u2019d seen the last of him for a while,\u201d she allows, as Xichen sets his burden down. She was the doctor for Wangji\u2019s birth; for Xichen\u2019s too. She cured A-Yuan of the fever that nearly took his life, and Wangji when the whips nearly took his. \u201cWhat happened now?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\"> Xichen draws a breath, and finds he doesn\u2019t have the words. \u201cI need to speak to my Uncle,\u201d he says. \u201cWangji has a wound on his chest that will need seeing to. For the rest of it \u2026\u201d He leaves the words unspoken, because he doesn\u2019t know. He doesn\u2019t know.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">The steps to his Uncle\u2019s rooms, not far from Xichen\u2019s own quarters in the Hanshi, have been walked so often that he\u2019s practically worn grooves in the wood. But the way before him feels unfamiliar. Every step feels wrong, as if the path has already fallen out from under his feet without his notice: washed out when their home burned and he and Wangji\u2019s father was murdered. Not for the first time he wishes for the wisdom and comfort of his sworn brothers - but he\u2019s already ushered in a new year without Da-Ge beside him, and the memory of that loss makes him breathless. The thought of losing Wangji as well is a horror beyond his ability to voice, and one he\u2019d foolishly hoped had died three years before.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\"> \u201cUncle?\u201d he calls, and almost hopes that an answer won\u2019t come.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\"> They walk back in silence. A gray dawn is just beginning to break. Through windows Xichen can see candles being lit, and hear the sounds of people waking up. The sleeplessness is wearing on him. His eyes feel gritty. His body is sore all over, bruised beneath his robes. His memories lie to him. They tell him that Wangji had gotten better. That he\u2019d finished grieving and made his peace, and was ready to rejoin the world. </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Uncle says very little to the doctor\u2019s pronouncements. From the alcohol, Wangji should suffer no ill effects besides the usual. From the brand, he would be adding a sun to his collection of scars. Wangji doesn\u2019t stir; he breathes shallowly on the sick bed, sleeping a false sleep. His shoulders are bare; the blanket is pulled up to his collarbone. It\u2019s nearly high enough to cover the bandages. His skin is sallow. The lids of his eyes are reddened and fragile looking. He still smells of liquor. </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Lan Qiaohua waits for questions and receives none, and retreats with her arms held in a loose salute, to go make her morning tea.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cDid you know he\u2019d go to Yiling?\u201d Uncle asks, when they\u2019re alone. </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Xichen shakes his head. He thought Wangji might, though. \u201cTo pay his respects,\u201d he says numbly. \u201cAnd to say goodbye.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">The silence that follows is profound and considering. Xichen traces the features of Wangji\u2019s sleeping face. The last of Wangji\u2019s babyfat had melted away during the Sunshot Campaign but he never stopped looking soft and young to Xichen. He\u2019s never forgotten the weight of his brother, hefted on one hip.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\"> \u201cAnother year of seclusion,\u201d Uncle declares. </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\"> \u201cNo,\u201d Xichen says.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\"> \u201cNo?\u201d Uncle repeats, disbelieving.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\"> It\u2019s the third time in all of Xichen\u2019s life that he has, in some meagre way, defied his uncle. No doubt Da-Ge (or even A-Yao) would have thought little of his rebellion. In the moment he thinks very little of it himself, feels no flicker of nerves or anger or much of anything at all. Just an uneasy, disbelieving fear, like standing too far away from a fire to feel either warmth or danger. What good is another year, if thirty-three lashes did not beat obedience back into Lan Wangji? </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\"> \u201cWei Wuxian is dead,\u201d Uncle says, and Xichen hears his own fear and confusion echoed back to him. It\u2019s true - Wei Wuxian is dead, leaving not even a ghost behind, vengeful or otherwise. And yet here they sit. </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\"> For a moment Xichen feels true anger lick at him: they have been through so much, the three of them. The last of their immediate family. Xichen\u2019s own sleep is disturbed often with memories of the war, of killing. The memories he seals away during the daytime come rushing back to him at night, as unspoiled and sharp as when he was in the thick of things, where he held dying men, and learned to fear death. Had they not all suffered terribly? Had Xichen not sat locked away with their clan\u2019s books, imagining his brother\u2019s death a thousand times over, in a thousand different ways - the helplessness worse than any battlefield?\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\"> He hadn\u2019t imagined this - that death would be something Wangji would choose, if given the opportunity. He knows with chill certainty what waits at the end of this narrow path, and that Wangji will only hurry his steps towards it unless - </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\"> Unless - </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\"> He doesn\u2019t know, and Wangji wakes before Xichen can even think of what might save his brother\u2019s life. </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\"> It\u2019s Uncle who moves first, to scoop Wangji\u2019s hair away from his face, and to hold it twisted softly at the back of his neck until he\u2019s finished being sick, and it\u2019s Uncle who leaves first as well, not even waiting for punishment to be decided between the three of them. \u201cKeep him, then,\u201d is all he says as he shakes his sleeves and sweeps out of the room.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Wangji\u2019s eyes flicker up to Xichen\u2019s and, for once, stay there for a long time. He doesn\u2019t look away until Xichen begins to tell him what happened, what he\u2019s done. The words are difficult to find. He\u2019s forgotten how to speak the language they used to share. His brother\u2019s face looks nothing but blank to him. </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cYou will kneel as punishment, for as long as you see fit,\u201d Xichen tells him, after the story runs out. The tea that Lan Qiaohua brought both of them has grown cold. The incense she lit to clear the room has long burned out. \u201cI must go see to your son.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Wangji\u2019s hands clench in his lap. His mouth quivers. He says nothing, so Xichen takes his leave too. The world has come alive again while Wangji has been dreaming. Cloud Recesses is full of everyday activities, the sounds and sights he\u2019s grown too accustomed to. The sight of disciples clustered in groups, <em>Hanguang Jun</em> on their lips, who break guiltily apart when they see Zewu Jun coming - that, too, is painfully familiar.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Lan Sizhui is not in class, when Xichen peers in through the open doorway. He sighs, and goes to the kitchen first, to get a meal in case his adopted nephew interpreted \u201cDon\u2019t come out\u201d as, \u201cuntil you\u2019re told otherwise.\u201d When he returns to the Hanshi it seems that this is the case: A-Yuan has dressed himself and fixed his own hair and forehead ribbon, and is waiting, so very patiently, for the door to open and someone to come for him. His little hands still on Xichen\u2019s writing desk, positioned for chords. His dark eyes dart over Xichen\u2019s shoulder, seeking Wangji, and he looks down quickly to hide his disappointment.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Xichen sets their meal down on the table, sets out a bowl and spoon and chopsticks for each of them. He scoops rice mechanically into A-Yuan\u2019s bowl, as if the boy is still too small to serve himself. His face aches, where Wangji hit him last night. Each mouthful makes the bruise feel more tender and, anyway, only tastes like ashes. Xichen puts his own bowl down with a sigh. </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\"> \u201cWhere is Father?\u201d A-Yuan asks.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\"><em> Speech during meals is forbidden,</em> Xichen thinks automatically, but A-Yuan isn\u2019t eating any more than he is. </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\"> Wei Wuxian is dead - and yet here Xichen sits, helping to raise the man\u2019s child. Perhaps he was a fool, not to see this coming. Perhaps he has been a fool all along, to think that raising the boy would be good for Wangji, and not a living reminder of all of their failures: as if Wangji hadn\u2019t named A-Yuan after his own grief, and dared the world to say anything about it. Was A-Yuan happy? Could be happy, in such a home, with such a guardian? \u201cHe\u2019s receiving punishment,\u201d Xichen says finally. </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\"> From the look that passes over A-Yuan\u2019s face, it probably would have been less alarming to hear that Wangji had been injured on his travels. \u201cCan I see him?\u201d A-Yuan asks. His little hands make anxious fists on his knees. His posture is impeccable. He breathes fast, like one of Wangji\u2019s rabbits. </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\"> \u201cNo,\u201d Xichen says.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\"> \u201cI want to see him,\u201d A-Yuan says. He\u2019s too old to make demands like this, and Xichen can see on his face that he knows it. </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\"> \u201cA-Yuan,\u201d Xichen starts, and it\u2019s against the rules to interrupt your elders and against the rules to show excess emotion but the plea bursts from A-Yuan\u2019s heart like an arrow, and plunges into Xichen\u2019s own. </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\"><em>\u201cPlease,\u201d</em> A-Yuan begs. \u201cPlease let me see my father.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\"> Throughout his life, Lan Xichen will have many opportunities to repent for his own softness. He will try over and over again to harden his spirit, and he will always fail to do so, and he fails to do so now. Years later, when he is so alone, and questioning every choice he\u2019d ever made in life, he will look out of the windows of his quiet heart and think: at least Wangji lived. </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\"> Xichen breathes out. He says, mostly to himself, \u201cHe would want to see you.\u201d And then to A-Yuan, \u201cAll right. Eat first. Then I\u2019ll take you.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\"> Bellies full, dishes neatly stacked, they go together to a part of the Cloud Recesses A-Yuan would probably not have visited before. The buildings are all newly washed, the wood hallways and paths neatly swept. The stones in the courtyards are perfectly white around the hills and bumps of ornamental plants, dusted lightly with the falling snow. This is a place for adults to go, not for children. But A-Yuan had asked, and Xichen had listened, and now they\u2019re here, and Xichen watches A-Yuan steel his emotions and straighten his face.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\"> The people there look at Lan Xichen and Lan Sizhui with disbelief on their faces, and whisper quietly as they pass. They thin like trees as the two of them get closer to the heart of Cloud Recesses, until they turn a corner and there is no one at all except for Lan Wangji, kneeling alone on the ground without a cushion or a winter robe. His head is bare, the silver headpieces gone, his hair up only in the half-knot he wears inside the Jingshi. There\u2019s snow in the wispy pieces hanging around his face, snow across the lashed bamboo poles he holds at shoulder height, perfectly still. Xichen\u2019s chest throbs to see him. </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\"> A-Yuan pulls his hand out of Xichen\u2019s and runs the last few steps, flinging himself onto his knees next to Wangji, who flinches visibly. He looks at Xichen instead of at A-Yuan, his eyes narrowing. He\u2019s furious that Xichen allowed A-Yuan to come, to see him like this. The part of Xichen that isn\u2019t soft, that wants to rip the bamboo out of Wangji\u2019s hands and shake him until he\u2019s actually sorry, has no trouble meeting that angry gaze. Wangji will always be the one who looks away first.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\"> A-Yuan molds himself to Wangji\u2019s side, his little hands resting gingerly on Wangji\u2019s arm, careful not to pull him off balance. He\u2019s a small child. Even for his age, even measured against anything other than Wangji and his height, he\u2019s so small. \u201cWhy?\u201d he cries. It\u2019s a large question, open to many interpretations. Why is this happening? Why is Wangji being punished? Why was he left alone? </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\"> \u201cThis is his decision,\u201d Lan Xichen says carefully. \u201cA-Yuan, there are consequences to every action.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\"> But A-Yuan shakes his head. \u201cNo,\u201d he says, his fingers tightening on Wangji\u2019s arm. \u201cNo, why did you - where did you <em>go?\u201d</em></span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\"><em> Tell him,</em> Xichen thinks. <em>He knows who the Yiling Patriarch is. You taught him yourself. Maybe he would remember more, if given a chance to. Maybe you could grieve together. Tell him.</em> But Wangji says nothing, stares straight ahead, looking through them.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\"> \u201cTake me with you next time,\u201d A-Yuan begs. \u201cPlease, take A-Yuan with you.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\"> Lan Xichen\u2019s voice turns so sharp it\u2019s as if Uncle is speaking through him. \u201cThere will be no next time,\u201d he says, and then says again, softer, his eyes flickering to A-Yuan, \u201cWangji, there are consequences to every action.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Wangji\u2019s eyes widen. His breath comes as shallow puffs in the chill air. Xichen\u2019s breath doesn\u2019t come at all. The threat hangs between them, stretching as thin as Xichen\u2019s patience, his hope. Neither of them say anything for a long time.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Wangji looks away first, as Xichen knew he would. He squeezes his eyes closed and lowers his head. He sways, almost imperceptibly, closer to his child. He nods once. Xichen\u2019s breath tumbles out of his chest.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 \u00a0</span></span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">It\u2019s started to snow again, just little whispers against A-Yuan\u2019s cheeks. Seeing this, Xichen holds out his hand. \u201cLet\u2019s go inside,\u201d he says. A-Yuan looks to his father, who finally looks back. He gives a small shake of his head. </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">A-Yuan doesn\u2019t protest. But instead of taking Xichen\u2019s hand, he reaches into his sleeves, digging around for a moment before he pulls out a rumpled, faded-brown grass butterfly, and gently sets it on Wangji\u2019s knee. He wipes his face, climbs to his feet, and gently brushes the snow out of Wangji\u2019s hair. Only then does he take Xichen\u2019s hand and allow himself to be led away, looking over his shoulder until father is out of sight once more.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p2\" align=\"center\">\n<span class=\"s1\">-</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\"> The first time Lan Sizhui leaves the clouds and represents Gusu Lan to the world, he is ten or eleven years old. They travel by boat, and he is sick the entire length of the journey. He is sick from the moment he steps on their boat each morning, and for hours after they disembark at night. It is three full days of suffering, broken only by the humiliation of Hanguang Jun bringing him broth and clean wet cloths to wipe his face. </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\"> The trip comes three months after he\u2019d donned the white uniform of a junior disciple and left the Jingshi for the dormitory his cohort will live in throughout their training. Two months after that, a letter had arrived in Cloud Recesses. Enclosed in the purple scroll was an invitation to a Cultivation Conference, written on purple paper. It was delivered during the evening meal, on a night that Lan Sizhui had been eating with his family instead of his peers, so he\u2019d been present as Master Lan unrolled it, read it through carefully, and then passed it to Uncle to read.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cThey must have finished the renovations to the hall,\u201d Master Lan said.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cI will send Gusu Lan\u2019s acceptance,\u201d Uncle said.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Father\u2019s lip had curled, very slightly, but he said nothing.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cWangji, you will attend as well,\u201d Master Lan said. </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Father and Uncle looked at each other. \u201cWe\u2019ll take Sizhui with us,\u201d Uncle said, after a moment. Master Lan made a noise into his beard, and Uncle added, \u201cHe\u2019s old enough. He will need to know about these things, given his position in the family.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Uncle rolled his eyes to the heavens, but only said, \u201cYou will do as you like.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">And here Sizhui was, making a mess of everything. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he begs Hanguang Jun, the first night. \u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s wrong with me,\u201d he says on the second. On the third he says, as determined as he can manage, \u201cI won\u2019t eat anything at all tomorrow so that when we arrive I can stand with you to greet our hosts.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Father wipes the sweat off Sizhui\u2019s forehead, and smiles his almost-smile. \u201cIn the morning, you\u2019ll eat,\u201d he orders. \u201cThe ceremonies tomorrow aren\u2019t important. Rest, and be ready for the next day. There\u2019s much for you to learn.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Lan Sizhui is eager to learn, eager to show himself as a credit to Gusu Lan, eager to see famous cultivators perform feats of swordsmanship and archery and song, eager to see a place so different than his home, but he is sick instead - and so miserable that he doesn\u2019t notice at all the tight, pained way his father moves, the way he speaks even less than usual, the way his hands hold a tremor almost too fine to be seen. </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Yunmeng is indeed beautiful, even if Lan Sizhui has to watch their approach through their boat\u2019s slitted curtain, his face propped up on Hanguang Jun\u2019s bundled outer robe so that he can feel the breeze on his face, and also be close enough to the water in case he needs to throw up again. </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cHow are you from Gusu,\u201d Lan Jingyi says, though he sounds more confused instead of disgusted. Lan Sizhui, who by this time remembers nothing of a life before the clouds, wonders the same thing.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">The lake they enter stretches almost as far as the eye can see, gracefully dotted with strange plants that sprawl across the surface of the water, which has become so shallow that Lan Sizhui can see flashes of carp scales almost within reach of his fingertips. He throws up one final time before they make their landing - partially out of fear that he\u2019ll do it on the dock instead, right at the clan leader\u2019s feet, but also partially because as they get close the air becomes redolent with things he\u2019s never smelled before, like chili peppers, and spices that numb the tongue and heat the blood, and fatty meat grilled on an open flame. He isn\u2019t the only Gusu Lan disciple who looks queasy clambering onto Lotus Pier.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">He doesn\u2019t throw up at the clan leader\u2019s feet, which he will offer prayers of gratitude for later since the Jiang clan leader is fierce and unfriendly and disconcertingly uncourteous. The most ill-mannered person Lan Sizhui can remember meeting is Lan Jingyi, so Sandu Shengshou is an unappetizing glimpse into the world outside of Gusu. But Lan Sizhui is a forgiving and optimistic child, and more importantly knows he\u2019s only expected to sit silently and absorb knowledge from his elders, so there\u2019s no need to be too frightened. The next day, once the sea sickness has passed, he diligently starts to record his observations for Hanguang Jun, who will save them in a lacquered chest along with A-Yuan\u2019s first pair of shoes, his battered toys, his best schoolwork, and many, many childish drawings of rabbits. (Decades later, he will return these faithful notes to Lan Sizhui as \u201cpreparation\u201d for assuming leadership of Gusu Lan, and Sizhui\u2019s other father will laugh himself sick upon reading them.) </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">He keeps as close to Hanguang Jun\u2019s hem as he can over the next few days, which is not close at all, not nearly as close as Sizhui is used to or would like. It\u2019s not only that Hanguang Jun is very important, and many people want his brusque opinion on this matter or that; or that as the smallest and most junior of the Gusu Lan disciples (excepting Lan Jingyi), he is seated or standing in the least important position (excepting Lan Jingyi). But it is also true that Hanguang Jun seems strangely forgetful. He is far away even when Sizhui is standing right next to him.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">But to Sizhui everything seems fine until the fourth day. The Gusu Lan contingent has been housed right next to the lake, in a series of rooms circling a lovely little courtyard with flower patterns everywhere. They light their lamps in a pale blue dawn, the morning so misty that it\u2019s seeped under doors and through open windows. Lan Sizhui loves it, loves the strangeness of it; he feels like he\u2019s woken up in a magical land. When mist comes to Cloud Recesses it chills the bones, but here it\u2019s warm like bathwater, like how he imagines the lake with its strange plants to feel. </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">On the first morning Father had called Sizhui to his room, so early he was still stumbling bleary-eyed and queasy, and it had been the entirety of the time they spent with each other for the whole day, so on the next day and the next Sizhui had gone without needing to be called. </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">On the fourth day he wakes early. They eat breakfast with Uncle, and then Father combs Sizhui\u2019s hair for him and fixes his ribbon, something he hasn\u2019t done since Sizhui left the Jingshi. The first morning it almost lulled him back to sleep, but this morning he can barely sit still. He wants to talk about the archery competition that yesterday Hanguang Jun had easily won. He wants to talk about the monsters he\u2019s heard about in the discussions, and whether Father and Uncle have ever faced anything so terrible. He wants to know what exciting things they\u2019ll see when they all go into Yunmeng today.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">But Father remains seated when Uncle and Sizhui rise to leave, and since Uncle doesn\u2019t ask why Father isn\u2019t coming with them, Sizhui can\u2019t ask either. He smooths his face over and doesn\u2019t pout, though he is a little quiet as they meet the Jiang disciples who will escort them around Yunmeng. Sandu Shengshou isn\u2019t one of them, thankfully, although Lianfang Zun is, who Lan Sizhui knows well from his frequent visits to Cloud Recesses. Lianfang Zun is kind, and is such a knowledgeable tour guide that the Jiang disciples stop talking and listen to him instead, even though he isn\u2019t from Lotus Pier or Yunmeng at all. He buys Sizhui and Jingyi flaky scallion pancakes, and spicy peanuts, and sweet red bean buns when the spiciness makes their eyes water.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Yunmeng is beautiful, and Lan Sizhui is learning so many wonderful new things, but he can\u2019t shake off his quiet feeling, no matter how much Lan Jingyi tries to trick him into eating more peanuts. Zewu Jun smiles his real-smile all day, the first time Lan Sizhui has seen it in Lotus Pier. He doesn\u2019t seem bothered that Hanguang Jun stayed behind, or that Lan Sizhui\u2019s chin is low against his chest, or that Lan Jingyi eats so much that he\u2019ll spend the rest of the night being very sick. </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Over lunch, Lianfang Zun remarks, \u201cIt\u2019s good to see your brother at the conference. I\u2019ve been afraid he would never again leave Cloud Recesses, except to defend fishing villages from fierce corpses.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Zewu Jun actually laughs. He says, \u201cHe had to be ordered to attend, A-Yao. Do you know, this is the first time he\u2019s ever been to Yunmeng at all? All this time, he\u2019s avoided the region entirely.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Lianfang Zun makes a thoughtful noise, sympathetic. \u201cThere are many ghosts for him at Lotus Pier,\u201d he says.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Zewu Jun admits, \u201cI wake up every day expecting him to have abandoned us all and gone back to Gusu, or vanished into the wind.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Lan Jingyi kicks Lan Sizhui under the table. They make eyes at each other to express their outrage: <em>Abandon us?? Never!</em> But Lianfang Zun only sighs. \u201cIt\u2019s clear he\u2019s unhappy,\u201d he says. \u201cAfter yesterday\u2019s performance, others came to me to complain about -\u201d but he stops himself. His eyes are so apologetic that they look like mountain pools, fascinating in their clarity, every stone exposed.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cIt was an,\u201d Zewu Jun says softly, \u201cungracious thing to say.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cOnly unpolitic,\u201d Lianfang Zun says soothingly. \u201cWe live in peaceful times now, Er-ge. People want to forget about the past.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cExcept my brother,\u201d Zewu Jun says.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">What Hanguang Jun had said, after the final arrow had soared and the crowd had cheered and Sandu Shengshou came to congratulate him on the win, was, \u201cEveryone better than me is dead.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\"> Lianfang Zun puts a hand over Zewu Jun\u2019s. \u201cGive him time,\u201d he says. \u201cHe will take off the mourning robes eventually.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\"> Zewu Jun sighs. \u201cIt\u2019s been almost seven years.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\"> \u201cThree of which were spent in,\u201d Lianfang Zun retorts but then he looks at Lan Sizhui and Lan Jingyi and doesn\u2019t finish the thought. He continues, more quietly, \u201cHe\u2019s a private man. You know this better than anyone. He will come back to the world if he is given the space and the choice to do so.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cI only ask that he stays until the end of the conference,\u201d Zewu Jun says, but his smile is back, the real one. He turns his hand over to wrap his fingers around Lianfang Zun\u2019s. \u201cIf he manages it I will not ask anything of him for another seven years.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">On the way back to Lotus Pier, Lianfang Zun buys one more treat. He crouches a little so that he\u2019s the same height as Lan Sizhui. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you give this to Hanguang Jun,\u201d he suggests, and smiles. \u201cHe wouldn\u2019t have had this before. I bet it will make him feel better.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Hanguang Jun is not in their rooms, though. He\u2019s not at the training fields. He\u2019s not in the big hall where all of the important meetings have been held. Lan Sizhui doesn\u2019t run, because running is forbidden even when you\u2019re not in the Cloud Recesses, but he walks as quickly as his little feet will carry him. Hanguang Jun would never abandon them, but he <em>has</em> been sad, and Sizhui feels foolish not to have seen it before, because he could have <em>helped.</em> There are many adults bustling around, and they don\u2019t pay any attention to him at all.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">He finds his father, finally, in a little courtyard tucked down a winding walkway so far away from the busy places that the buildings are more like piers themselves, up on stilts above the lake. Sizhui\u2019s feet slow automatically, finding pace with the sigh of water moving back and forth underneath the walkway. It\u2019s a peaceful place to sit and rest, with a beautifully carved wooden bench and a pretty little tree in a pot next to it. The sun is dying behind the far away hills, and it bounces over the surface of the water and paints patterns along the dark wood, the little pavilion, Father\u2019s silver headpieces, and his bowed head. He doesn\u2019t react when Sizhui approaches. His eyes are the kind of far away that keeps Sizhui quiet, waiting to be noticed. He waits for a long time.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Father\u2019s expression is strange when he looks up. He says nothing. He reaches up and strokes Sizhui\u2019s hair. The corners of his eyes are very red. </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">There\u2019s a quality to his stillness that is unnerving. A little scary.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cI brought you something,\u201d Sizhui blurts. He pulls the little paper bag out of his sleeve and unrolls the top of it, holds it out for Father to take. He\u2019d saved the whole bag just like Lianfang Zun had told him to, but he\u2019d eaten a little bit from Lan Jingyi\u2019s portion and he thinks maybe Father will like them, that maybe it will help. \u201cThey\u2019re fresh lotus seeds.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Father flinches. His fingers twitch back from where they were about to lift the bag of seeds out of Lan Sizhui\u2019s hands. But Sizhui had already had the bag set on his fingertips, and it spills everywhere. The lotus seeds land on the bench and bounce off Father\u2019s robes. They fall between the planks and disappear soundlessly into the water. Sizhui stares in horror. </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">And then jumps - when a very loud, very angry voice calls out to them.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Lan Sizhui\u2019s insides turn to dust when he sees who is yelling. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d Sandu Shengshou demands, from far away. \u201cThis is not a public area of Lotus Pier. Who are you looking for, Lan Wangji?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Hanguang Jun is on his feet in an instant, pushing Lan Sizhui behind him. Behind his sleeve, Sizhui watches Sandu Shengshou stomp down the pier. \u201cWell?\u201d Sandu Shengshou says. He\u2019s so loud. His fist is sparkling with purple lightning. </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">For seven years, Lan Sizhui has not heard a raised voice or seen a fist lifted in anger. Hanguang Jun\u2019s hand tightens on his shoulder, but it\u2019s shaking, and he doesn\u2019t say anything - and for the first time in all his life Sizhui realizes that maybe he can\u2019t.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">His feet move before his head can think about it. He ducks under Hanguang Jun\u2019s hand - and then steps in front of <em>him.</em> \u201cPlease, Clan Leader Jiang!\u201d he says, and bows as best as he possibly can. \u201cPlease, it is this disciple\u2019s fault. I - I wanted to see the fish in the lake. Hanguang Jun was only bringing me back.\u201d He looks up at Hanguang Jun and says, sincerely, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Hanguang Jun.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Sandu Shengshou stares at him, and then looks at Hanguang Jun. He wears so many emotions on his face that it\u2019s dizzying for Lan Sizhui to look at him, but at least the lightning has gone away. Lan Sizhui is frozen in his bow, his eyes trained on the wood beneath their feet. His hair falls down over his shoulders. Through the slats he can see fish, wriggling just below the glittering surface. He wishes Hanguang Jun would put a hand back on his shoulder. </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cIs this your kid?\u201d Sandu Shengshou says abruptly. \u201cHe looks like you.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Lan Sizhui looks up. The question curls unpleasantly in his stomach. He\u2019s never been asked, not outright, not like this. Everyone in Cloud Recesses knows who Lan Sizhui is, but equally they all know what Sizhui isn\u2019t. When neither of them say anything, Sandu Shengshou laughs. \u201cNo,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t suppose there\u2019s any woman who would have caught your eye, Second Master Lan.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Lan Sizhui frowns. He doesn\u2019t understand what Sandu Shengshou means, not really, but it sounds bad, like an insult. \u201cHanguang Jun is my father,\u201d he says, as firmly as his rabbit heart will allow.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Faintly, too soft to be heard over the sound of water, Lan Wangji exhales. His eyes are unfocused, unsteady, aimed somewhere in the middle distance. His expression doesn\u2019t change, not more than it ever really does. Only the miniscule parting of his lips betray that he feels anything at all, much less that he is breathless and overwhelmed: so sad that he feels it as a mortal wound, so furious that he would probably choke if he tried to give voice to his contempt. </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Lan Wangji has known for years that grief is a tree without roots, that it cannot be dug from the heart by any ordinary means. He lives with his sadness the way he lives with the scars on his back, without hope that either will fade until the seas run dry and the mountains crumble. He has put ten thousand li between himself and the things he can never have, never undo - and if it had been his choice, the whole of Yunmeng would never have known his name. But there have been few choices offered to Lan Wangji throughout his life, and fewer still that mattered. </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Uncle had said to go to Lotus Pier, so he\u2019d gone to Lotus Pier. Anticipating the pain and finding the reality worse: his grief as fresh as snow, as refined and perfected as a wine aged for many years, which is the same number of years he\u2019d known Wei Ying at all. They weigh him down and make him old. They rob him of the little patience he has for politics and the responsibilities he never really wanted in the first place. He returned to the world to find it more or less as he\u2019d left it, and himself more bitter for the time that had passed. </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">So Lan Wangji had left. Had climbed onto his sword when the day was hot and the shifting clouds blocked the white sun, and abandoned his duties and his family, meaning never to return. It wasn\u2019t the first time he had done it, and it\u2019s far from the last. It\u2019s a cycle that happens so often it\u2019s become a habit, whenever he feels like the clouds and the quiet will strangle him. He will deliver Sizhui to his brother\u2019s care and descend the mountain in search of whatever chaos he can lay his hands on. It calms him, and makes quiet the misery that lives in his chest, and makes it easier to come back to Gusu and be Lan Wangji again. </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">He\u2019d gotten nearly all the way across the vast lake before he realized that there was nowhere for him in Yunmeng, and no chaos to be found there that would satisfy. His shadow trailed forlornly over the clear water, outlined in stark solitude. He turned back, but made it only to the furthest pier and no further, unable to clear his muddied thoughts and reassemble the armor that had gotten him through the last few days.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">He wants Wei Ying to be alive. That\u2019s the simple truth of it, unadorned by poetry or beauty or any of the words he doesn\u2019t have to describe how much he wants. That Wei Ying is not alive is a mistake that will never be undone. He has pictured, over and over, turning around and simply finding Wei Ying there - whole, alive, smiling, beautiful, the way he should be. Every path he has walked in Lotus Pier, Wei Ying has walked half a step behind. Which had been his rooms? The books he\u2019d owned, the clothes he\u2019d worn, the arrows he\u2019d hunted kites with? His favorite foods? Favorite places to play, trees to climb, ponds to swim through? </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">He\u2019s spent days combing through his memories until they\u2019re barely more than threads, so well-loved and abused that they feel like paper creased until it\u2019s nearly torn. Was he ever told these things? He doesn\u2019t know; he can barely remember. Every dish becomes Wei Ying\u2019s favorite. Every tree is the best tree in Yunmeng to climb. Every heartbeat feels like the echo of a life he only truly was ever on the outskirts of. Every breath strangles him with regret.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">But there - standing between Lan Wangji and the last person left alive that Lan Wangji truly hates - there are the shaking shoulders of his child, narrow and inadequate but there, a shock that is wholly new and one he is truly unprepared to deal with.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">It\u2019s enough of a shock that, standing behind Sizhui, he takes a breath of his own. His head clears a little of the fog that\u2019s haunted him for days. He sees the surprise in Jiang Wanyin\u2019s eyes, the conflict there. Sizhui\u2019s defense of him has pushed them both off-balance.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Lan Wangji is the first to recover, as he always is. He puts his hand back on Sizhui\u2019s shoulder, then pushes him forward. Jiang Wanyin lets them pass, abruptly quiet - his arms folded across his chest, his expression complex. </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">When they\u2019re nearly away, Jiang Wanyin calls after them. \u201cDon\u2019t go wandering around anymore,\u201d he says. \u201cYou won\u2019t find who you\u2019re looking for at Lotus Pier, Second Master Lan.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Lan Wangji keeps a hand on Sizhui\u2019s shoulder as they walk back to Gusu Lan\u2019s quarters. They\u2019re both trembling, walking too fast. By the time Lan Wangji closes the doors behind them, Sizhui is near tears. He pulls away from Lan Wangji and runs to the desk the room had been equipped with. There is paper and ink and brushes already on top of it, and a pile of correspondence that Xichen had left behind in Wangji\u2019s room for him to read through. Sizhui folds himself down, takes a moment to rearrange his hair and his posture and wipe his face, and then wets a brush and bends to work.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Lan Wangji sits next to him, watching intently. His thoughts tumble through him. He can\u2019t speak, but he wouldn\u2019t know the words to choose even if he could. He\u2019s never had the ability to name his emotions, and especially not if more than one of them comes crashing through him. He might as well try to lure the moon from a pond, or ask the rabbits to interpret his own temperament to him. </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">He reaches out and covers Sizhui\u2019s hand with his own, and moves it gently away from the page. Sizhui\u2019s fingers twitch around the brush. He\u2019s only on the fifth precept. \u201cI broke rules,\u201d he mumbles.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">With profound effort, squeezing each word between everything else that\u2019s crowding his heart, Lan Wangji says, \u201cPunishment is waived.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Sizhui\u2019s eyes flicker up to his face, and then back down to their hands. His jaw pushes out a bit, even as a few tears slip from his eyes and trail down his round cheeks. He wants to take the punishment anyway. He\u2019d accepted the consequences of his actions before he\u2019d even stepped forward. </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Strangely, Lan Wangji wants to laugh. It would probably scare Sizhui if he did, so he doesn\u2019t, but he lets the feeling settle into his chest, lets his heart get quiet. He pulls one sleeve over his fingers and wipes Sizhui\u2019s tears away as he has so many times before. Sizhui leans into it, unselfconscious in the way that children are if only you let them, and the feeling grows, sets down roots. </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\"><em>Wei Ying,</em> he thinks, and for once it hurts a little less.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p2\" align=\"center\">\n<span class=\"s1\">-</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">At the age of thirteen or so, most Gusu Lan disciples have been studying cultivation for nearly a decade. They are proficient in the Five Arts (some more than others, depending on temperament and ability) and well-versed in identifying and suppressing monsters, ghosts, and other dangers of the night (some more than others, depending on how scary a particular monster is and whether it is something truly terrible, like a snake or a spider). Their golden cores hum with the desire to prove themselves, to win glory and respect, to see the world below the clouds, to further their cultivation at the feet of the very best.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">So of course it\u2019s crushing when, three days before they are to leave the mountain as junior cultivators for the first time, it is announced that Hanguang Jun will not be the one leading them.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cBut <em>why?\u201d</em> Lan Jingyi cries, following Lan Sizhui to the lower meadow where the rabbits live. Whenever Hanguang Jun is not at Cloud Recesses, it falls to the juniors to tend to his colony, or more usually, to Sizhui and Jingyi. It\u2019s forbidden to kill animals within the boundaries of Cloud Recesses, so after many years there are many rabbits, and many snares that lay just outside of the boundaries of Cloud Recesses. The rabbits know no fear and even less respect, and do their best to trip Jingyi as he trails pathetically after Sizhui, distributing lettuce and carrots. \u201cWhy isn\u2019t he coming with us?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Sizhui says. He upturns his basket and gives it a shake, letting vegetable scraps rain down on the crowd of hungry little faces at their feet. \u201cHe travels often, Jingyi. And I don\u2019t think anyone even <em>asked</em> him if he wanted to escort us.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cWhy would they need to <em>ask?\u201d</em> Jingyi demands. He throws himself down among the rabbits. \u201cHe teaches us all the time. Way more than the other junior classes. And it\u2019s your first night hunt! Doesn\u2019t he want to come?\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\"> Sizhui laughs. He settles down onto the grass next to Jingyi, but with much better posture. The rabbits hop right on up into his skirts, nosing at his hands for more treats. One particularly fat rabbit, white with a big black spot over one eye, ambles its way over to Jingyi instead and headbutts him in the knee as hard as it can. \u201cWe are not friends,\u201d Jingyi tells it angrily.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\"> \u201cHanguang Jun is very busy,\u201d Sizhui says. He pulls a carrot out of his sleeve but eats it himself instead of giving it to the rabbit. \u201cWe\u2019re lucky to have him as a teacher at all.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\"> Jingyi looks over his shoulders, but there\u2019s no one around. Why is Sizhui being so formal? He\u2019s not even <em>looking</em> at Jingyi - he\u2019s got his head bowed over the rabbits, gently fending them away from his carrot. \u201cYeah, but,\u201d Jingyi says, chewing at his bottom lip. \u201cWon\u2019t he be worried about you? <em>I\u2019d</em> be worried about you. Maybe he\u2019s <em>too</em> worried. Maybe he thinks if he sees you in danger he won\u2019t be able to stop himself from swooping in and saving you, and then you wouldn\u2019t learn <em>anything</em> and probably the rest of us wouldn\u2019t either.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Sizhui shoots an elbow into Jingyi\u2019s side, and then pats his shoulder soothingly, which is nice because Sizhui is <em>very</em> strong. \u201cWorry about yourself,\u201d Sizhui retorts. \u201cIsn\u2019t your mother\u2019s cousin leading us? Fifth Senior is a strong cultivator.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cI guess,\u201d Jingyi admits. Unwillingly, he pets the fat rabbit. It flings its entire long body at him shamelessly. \u201cBut he\u2019s not <em>Hanguang Jun</em>. Don\u2019t you just - feel better when he\u2019s there?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Sizhui smiles so warmly that for a moment Jingyi feels like one of the rabbits, fat and fearless and secure. \u201cOf course I do,\u201d he answers, and nudges Jingyi with his shoulder. \u201cBut he\u2019s taught us really well. We\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">They leave the mountain three days later, in two straight rows. Their white robes and forehead ribbons snap and flutter in the wind. They make for a beautiful sight as they walk behind Lan Zhiyi, even though sometimes their footsteps slow to exchange grins behind their sleeves. Even Sizhui and Jingyi can\u2019t help but feel giddy, for all that they\u2019d agreed in the meadow that they <em>would</em> feel better if it was Hanguang Jun leading them. Their senior, Lan Zhiyi, <em>is</em> strong, but he\u2019s also impatient with younger disciples, and believes that beatings are love and name-calling is affection, especially when it comes to Lan Jingyi. He allows them only one break for rest, to fill their waterskins at a river and rest their feet and eat whatever snacks their families had packed for them, and he spends most of it shouting at Jingyi.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cStop fooling around!\u201d he says.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cI wasn\u2019t!\u201d Jingyi shouts back, hopping off the boulder he\u2019d been trying to climb.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cPut your sword away!\u201d he says.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cIt wasn\u2019t out!\u201d Jingyi cries, resheathing his sword behind his back.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cIf you sit down and eat he\u2019ll stop yelling at you,\u201d Sizhui tells Jingyi, and hands him a steamed bun. Arguing with Sizhui is like arguing with a wall, so Jingyi takes it and stuffs half of it into his mouth instead of trying to convince him that nothing stops Lan Zhiyi from yelling, not even if Jingyi tried his best to <em>behave like a proper Lan.</em> The inside of the steamed bun is still warm, and full of mushrooms and bamboo, which is a combination that Jingyi loves and Sizhui hates. He must have asked the kitchen for it specially, knowing that Jingyi would forget to bring any food for himself.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d Jingyi says around mouthfuls of mushroom, feeling mollified. \u201cWe need to keep our strength up before doing battle. Do you want to practice sword fighting for a little while, just so we\u2019re warmed up before we come upon any fierce corpses?\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Sizhui grimaces at him. Jingyi hastily wipes his mouth on the inside of his sleeve, which is already stained from breakfast. \u201cIt\u2019s only one fierce corpse,\u201d Sizhui says. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to be scared.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cI\u2019m not scared,\u201d Jingyi says immediately. He reaches into Sizhui\u2019s bag for another bun. Sizhui dodges expertly, and then relents and hands Jingyi one anyway. Mushroom and bamboo again. The warm, soft taste of it melts comfortingly on Jingyi\u2019s tongue. \u201cYou\u2019re right though,\u201d he says, swallowing. \u201cYou\u2019re right. It\u2019s only one fierce corpse.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Their destination is only two or three li from Caiyi Town. When they passed through Caiyi, Sizhui became very nervous that a boat would be involved, but they only end up following a canal that becomes a stream that becomes a charming little river, with fish and birds and pretty reeds that grow from it. The water keeps pace with them, and its surface swarms with dragonflies. \u201cSwap positions with me,\u201d Jingyi hisses at Sizhui, \u201cI want to look at the river.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cYou should pay attention to Fifth Senior instead,\u201d Sizhui says, but he does it anyway.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Lan Zhiyi brings them to a halt just as night falls for real, on the side of a dusty road that\u2019s barely better than a trail through the forest. \u201cNo fooling around,\u201d he warns them sternly. \u201cEven a low-level corpse can hurt you, if you\u2019re not careful. I\u2019ll scare it into the open and you\u2019ll take turns freezing it with the talismans I have for you. If anything unusual happens, don\u2019t be brave - just run away and let me handle it. That means <em>you,</em> Jingyi.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cI wasn\u2019t doing anything,\u201d Jingyi protests. He says to Sizhui, \u201cI wasn\u2019t.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Sizhui ignores him. \u201cSenior,\u201d he asks instead, \u201cwhy haven\u2019t we gone to interview the villagers about the fierce corpse? Shouldn\u2019t we find out more information about it? Where it came from, if there are any other disturbed graves in the area, or -\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cWe already have the information we need,\u201d Lan Zhiyi says. \u201cTwo villagers came to Cloud Recesses a week ago to ask for our help. It\u2019s only a low-level corpse, but it keeps bothering their livestock. It\u2019ll be good practice for you.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Sizhui frowns. He doesn\u2019t seem nervous at all, even though he\u2019s <em>talking back.</em> \u201cBut Hanguang Jun says -\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\"><em> \u201cHanguang Jun,\u201d</em> Lan Zhiyi says, in the kind of tone he usually saves for Jingyi, \u201cisn\u2019t here. You\u2019re listening to me tonight. Do you understand, Lan Sizhui?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\"> Sizhui\u2019s lower lip juts out, but he drops his gaze. \u201cYes, Senior,\u201d he says.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Lan Zhiyi turns away. He pulls a stack of talismans out of a qiankun pouch and starts counting through them. He mutters angrily to himself as he does it, quietly enough that Jingyi only catches some of the words, which sound like \u201cnot enough chaos\u201d and \u201cstill chasing after his dead wife.\u201d He rouses himself to hold out a portion for each junior. Jingyi accepts his without a protest, and so does Sizhui, even though he\u2019s still got the ghost of backtalk lurking in his eyes.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">They leave the river behind as they walk on. The forest feels too quiet around them, the only sound the crunch of their boots on the road. It\u2019s too early in the night for the frogs to sing, and too early in the year for cicadas, and after a few minutes every sound starts to sound like the shuffle of corpse feet. Jingyi wipes his sweaty palms off on his clothing, and then puts one hand back on his sword.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cYou\u2019ll be able to smell it before it gets close,\u201d Sizhui says to him, out of the side of his mouth.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cI know,\u201d Jingyi says quickly. He touches the talismans in his sleeve, crinkling the paper anxiously. \u201cDoes Hanguang Jun really have a dead wife?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Sizhui turns towards him, his thick eyebrows knitting together in confusion. Did he not hear Lan Zhiyi complaining? \u201cNo,\u201d he says. </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cNo?\u201d echoes Jingyi, and so do the two boys in the next row behind them.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cNo? Where did you come from, then?\u201d Shuren says, leaning forward.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cNo? Isn\u2019t that where he goes all the time, to look for her soul?\u201d Liuxian asks, close enough that his sword handle pokes into Jingyi\u2019s back.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cHe goes to help people,\u201d Sizhui says, exasperated now. His face is a pale smear against the black trees. He walks facing forward, and doesn\u2019t turn around even when Jingyi shoves Liuxian back into formation. The boys bringing up the rear titter behind their sleeves, and everyone falls silent quickly when Lan Zhiyi whips a stern look over his shoulder at them.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cFocus,\u201d he snaps at them. \u201cWe\u2019re almost at the farmhouse.\u201d And then something lunges out of the darkness and drags him to the ground.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">For a moment all of the juniors are as still as trees. The <em>thing</em> is on top of Lan Zhiyi, and they scuffle right there in the dirt, a wide circle of white and brown robes, and there\u2019s less noise than Jingyi thought there would be - to fight a fierce corpse, but also just to fight <em>anyone</em>, to fight for real instead of just sparring, where you shout to be scary and also because it\u2019s fun to shout. The thing is shaped like a man, and it sounds like a man, making the same little muffled grunts that Lan Zhiyi is making, and it\u2019s only as the seconds flow by and they\u2019re <em>still fighting,</em> Lan Zhiyi still struggling and grunting with his back on the ground, that Jingyi smells it, faint and heavy. This corpse is so barely dead that he hardly stinks at all, the smell more like sour sweat than rot, his skin colored like skin instead of slimy green. Hanguang Jun\u2019s voice echoes through Jingyi\u2019s ears: <em>this one can\u2019t have been dead more than a day or two. It\u2019s a different corpse. There\u2019s more than one corpse in the woods.</em></span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cRun!\u201d Lan Zhiyi roars.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jingyi\u2019s feet obey before his mind can even hear the words. He runs. He grabs Sizhui by the elbow and together with the other junior disciples, they flee into the darkness. The moon isn\u2019t any brighter than their robes, and though he can see the farmhouse up ahead through the trees there\u2019s not a single lamp lit inside of it, all the windows cold and black. There\u2019s only a pathetic little fence around it, more brush than anything else, good for keeping chickens fenced in but not for much else. \u201cWe\u2019ll lock ourselves inside the house,\u201d Sizhui calls, and they run faster. </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">They fling the door closed behind them. Inside is a small space, entirely dark and smelling of hay and stale cooking. Xieren is the first to light a talisman, and the yellow flames reveal eight scared, pale faces, surrounded by the detritus of a life: hammers and chisels and wicker frames and half finished objects, scattered and dusty on work tables, everything from farm tools to musical instruments. It\u2019s cold inside, like the windows were left open, and it smells - strange. </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cIs everyone okay?\u201d Sizhui asks. Each boy pats himself down, checks his sleeves, wraps his fingers around the handle of his sword, breathing hard. </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cYes,\u201d Jingyi answers, and the rest of them nod fervently.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cDo you think Fifth Senior is okay?\u201d Liuxian whispers.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cHe\u2019ll be fine,\u201d Sizhui answers firmly. \u201cIt\u2019s better if he doesn\u2019t have to worry about us. We\u2019ll stay here, and if he doesn\u2019t come find us in an hour, we\u2019ll send up a signal flare.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Everyone nods again, and a few people reach out and pat Sizhui on the shoulder, as if in thanks. Jingyi\u2019s one of them, and Sizhui shoots him a little smile, like he\u2019s saying thanks back. It\u2019s a good plan, and Jingyi feels safer for it, even though the smell of the place is climbing up his spine just like the silence in the woods did. Is that stale cooking oil? Had whoever lived there hung game up in the rafters and forgotten about it? </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cCan we light a candle?\u201d Jingyi asks abruptly. \u201cIs there a brazier we can -\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">There\u2019s a low moan from the other side of the room, where a dim, dark doorway sits. All of the juniors go silent as one. </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">The talisman flickers in Xieren\u2019s hand, which has started to shake. The light bounces in his hands and makes lies of the shadows, so much so that when a green, greasy hand wraps around the doorframe, Jingyi can\u2019t make himself believe it\u2019s really there. </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">The corpse hauls itself piece by piece into the light. Its feet slide across the floor like they\u2019ve been nailed to the boards. Its clothing is half rotted off, and dusted with animal hair and mud. The wind blows through the room and the stench of it rises abruptly, filling the small space completely. </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jingyi\u2019s heart is beating so fast that suddenly he can\u2019t hear anything else. The room is small and he\u2019s the closest one to the corpse. What should he do? Throw a talisman at it? What if he misses? His sword is in his shaking hands. Should he attack? What if it moves as fast as the one that had come out of the woods? What if it hurts him?</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\"> The corpse takes another step into the room. It\u2019s making a noise low in its throat, something not quite like a groan. It\u2019s staring right at Jingyi, and he can\u2019t look away. </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cEveryone, get back outside,\u201d Sizhui says. He sounds like he\u2019s very, very far away. \u201cDon\u2019t push, but do it quickly. If it follows us we\u2019ll freeze it with talismans out in the yard just like we planned. If it doesn\u2019t follow we can trap it in the house again.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">The wind shifts again, cold on the back of Jingyi\u2019s neck, which is damp with sweat. Someone has opened the door. The corpse is closer, its arms coming up, groping for Jingyi, almost close enough to reach past his outstretched sword. He needs to turn around. He needs to follow Sizhui\u2019s lead and go outside, where they can maneuver better, and fight the corpse together. </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cJingyi!\u201d Sizhui shouts. \u201cJingyi, come on!\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\"> If he\u2019d had another moment - just one more second - Jingyi would have run. He\u2019d tensed to run, his whole body going stiff with the anticipation of movement. But then Xieren drops his talisman, and the lights go out.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\"> Everything happens all at once.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">He feels something collide with his sword, and then yank it right out of his hands. He hears metal clatter on the floor, and he turns to run.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\"> Pain flashes bright against the back of his eyes, sharp and bright enough that he almost thinks someone\u2019s lit another talisman.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\"> His face feels abruptly wet and hot. He snorts blood into his nose and down his throat and chokes on it.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\"> A huge, awful weight collides with his back.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\"> Everyone around him shouts, and three boys get stuck trying to run out of the open door.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\"> And Sizhui screams, \u201cJingyi!\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\"> Jingyi registers all of this in the time it takes to hit the ground, the fierce corpse on top of him. He\u2019d cried out in fear as he fell, and the weight crushes the rest of the air out of him. The absence of oxygen is as shocking as the pain of it all, of being crushed against the wooden boards. There\u2019s blood streaming down his face and into his nose and mouth and he doesn\u2019t know how it happened, did the corpse bite him, did it hurt him? The corpse is so much <em>bigger</em> than he is, all the way grown up and twice Jingyi\u2019s weight, and if he could <em>breathe</em> he could fight back but he\u2019s choking instead.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\"> Something collides with the corpse. Its bulk rocks a little, and one awful dead hand lifts from Jingyi just long enough to fling whatever it is away. Jingyi barely registers the movement and he doesn\u2019t at all hear the thud of a small body as it hits the work table all the way across the room. He\u2019s struggling against the horrible, suffocating mass on top of him, still choking. Only seconds have passed since the light went out. The corpse\u2019s humid breath is hot against his face. He\u2019s not going to be able to overpower it.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\"> The worst sound Jingyi has ever heard cuts abruptly through his terror, and leaves a silence in its wake so profound that even the coughing, sobbing sound of Jingyi\u2019s own breathing feels muted. It\u2019s not the noise itself but the feeling that follows it, dark and sticky. It fills the room like oily smoke and suddenly, his heart pounding, Jingyi realizes that he\u2019s fighting nothing: that the corpse has stopped, that its huge body is curved above him and not moving, and that his hands are free.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\"> He plunges his right hand into his left sleeve and blindly shoves all of the talismans he can at the corpse\u2019s face.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\"> For a second nothing happens. Then, slowly, the corpse collapses, burying Jingyi again under its weight. </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Voices collide, far above him. </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cIs he dead?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cHelp!\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cWe need to send a flare!\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cIs Jingyi <em>dead?\u201d</em></span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jingyi tries to move and can\u2019t. He\u2019s stuck firm, his breath coming as thin, pathetic whistles. \u201cUrgh,\u201d he wheezes.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 \u00a0</span></span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">A pair of knees hit the ground next to his face, barely visible through the tacky blood in his eyes. \u201cGet it off of him,\u201d Sizhui says urgently.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">It takes all of their combined strength to roll the corpse off of Jingyi. Sizhui\u2019s arms go around his shoulders halfway through and pull him upright. Sizhui speaks the whole time, directing the other boys where to go, to fetch water from the pump outside, to be careful of Jingyi\u2019s legs, to angle the dead weight properly. He\u2019s shaking, hard enough that it shakes Jingyi too. Each time he inhales, he shudders at the top of the breath. Jingyi wraps a hand around Sizhui\u2019s wrist. Sizhui puts his hand on top of Jingyi\u2019s, and they hold onto each other until Jingyi is all the way free.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Someone else puts a wet cloth to Jingyi\u2019s face, and starts wiping the blood off of him. It stings when it touches his forehead, and Jingyi hisses automatically between his teeth. \u201cSorry,\u201d he hears Liuxian say. \u201cYou ran into the tip of my sword when the lights went out.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Was that what happened? In his head he hears the ghost of his mother say, <em>you\u2019re lucky you still have both your eyes.</em> He shivers, and Sizhui\u2019s hand tightens around his own.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Suddenly, like stones being dropped into a dark pool, Xieren says, \u201cYou used demonic energy.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Sizhui tenses all over. \u201cNo I didn\u2019t,\u201d he says. Jingyi would struggle upright but he\u2019s not sure that he can now - Sizhui is <em>very</em> strong, and he feels like he\u2019s held by a rock. He stays still, stuck in the middle, waiting impatiently as whoever wipes blood out of his eyes.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cYes you did,\u201d Xieren says. \u201cI saw you. You picked up that dizi and you stopped the fierce corpse with it. Those are the Yiling Patriarch\u2019s tricks.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cEnergy is energy,\u201d Sizhui says. \u201cHanguang Jun says so. To be strong cultivators we need to be quick and use any tools at our disposal. That\u2019s all that I did.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cSizhui,\u201d Jingyi tries to say, but there\u2019s still blood in his mouth and it comes out strange and garbled. He spits, and the towel comes obligingly up to wipe his lips. </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cIt\u2019s heretical,\u201d Xieren says, but he sounds a little uncertain about it. Sizhui\u2019s the best student among all of the juniors, and everyone\u2019s friend. The question of using resentful energy has come up in their lessons before, and each Lan senior seems to have a different opinion of it. </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cIt\u2019s the Yiling Patriarch\u2019s invention,\u201d Shuren says, sounding less uncertain. His cousin was one of the ones who left Gusu Lan for Moling Su, and that whole group had been full of opinions about the Yiling Patriarch.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 </span>\u201cGrand Master Lan says anything that that the Yiling Patriarch made is evil.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cThe Yiling Patriarch invented the Stygian Lure Flags too,\u201d Sizhui says. His arm tightens around Jingyi\u2019s chest, who lets out an uncomfortable gurgle. \u201cGusu Lan didn\u2019t make that up. And the fire talisman you\u2019re holding, Xieren, he made that too.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">And the Compass of Evil, but maybe Jingyi\u2019s the only boy that has one of those, because Sizhui doesn\u2019t mention it. Jingyi taps on Sizhui\u2019s arm, trying to get him to let up, but Sizhui doesn\u2019t seem to notice. He can\u2019t open his eyes yet but he can hear the other boys shuffling around the room, drawing closer together, maybe. Drawing together against <em>Sizhui,</em> maybe. Everyone sounds so <em>tense</em> that his heart, just barely having accepted that maybe they didn\u2019t get killed by a fierce corpse, picks its pace right back up again.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cHey,\u201d Jingyi tries to say, but no one listens. </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cYou have to turn yourself in for punishment,\u201d Shuren says, sounding smug about it.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cPunish myself for <em>what?\u201d</em> Sizhui snarls, and the tone is enough to spur Jingyi into action, <em>really</em> into action, because he\u2019s never heard Sizhui raise his voice, not ever, and especially not against his own family, and he knows Sizhui would never hurt anyone but right now he\u2019s squeezing bruises into Jingyi\u2019s already bruised chest and he\u2019d like everyone to just <em>stop now! </em></span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cEveryone stop yelling!\u201d Jingyi yells, as loud as he can, and it\u2019s enough to startle everyone into obeying.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jingyi flails around until Sizhui finally lets him go, startled. Jinygi wipes his eyes with his grubby sleeves and finally, finally is able to open them. His eyes have been closed for so long that the light from the candles wavers strangely, and he has to blink hard a few times before everyone\u2019s faces swim back into focus. Like he\u2019d thought, the rest of the boys are clumped together in a weird, suspicious circle at the corpse\u2019s feet, except for Liuxian, who\u2019s kneeling next to Jingyi with a bloody cloth and a bucket full of water he\u2019d barely snatched out of range of Jingyi\u2019s thrashing limbs. </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jingyi fixes everyone with an icy glare. It works pretty well, probably because he\u2019s still pretty covered in blood; Xieren actually shrinks back behind Shuren\u2019s shoulder. \u201cStop talking,\u201d Jingyi tells them. His voice shakes a little, but he sounds as vicious as he means to be (which isn\u2019t nearly as vicious as Sizhui just now, but that\u2019s not what\u2019s important right now). </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">He turns to Sizhui, and sees him too for the first time: bruised all over, covered in Jingyi\u2019s blood, clean tear tracks on his cheeks, and a look on his face that\u2019s a little scary, one that Jingyi has never seen before. It kind of makes Jingyi want to cry too, if he\u2019s honest, but maybe that\u2019s another effect of almost getting his head taken off by a fierce corpse.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">So Jingyi grabs Sizhui by his shoulders, and gives him a good hard shake. \u201cYou stopped that thing with a flute?\u201d he demands. \u201cThat awful noise was a <em>flute?\u201d</em></span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Sizhui blinks at him. His chin is low against his chest. He thinks Jingyi is going to yell at him too. \u201cYes,\u201d he admits, after a moment.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cThat was terrible,\u201d Jingyi informs him, and gives him another shake. \u201cHanguang Jun would have your skin for playing so badly. If I was a fierce corpse I would have died a second time.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cI,\u201d Sizhui stutters. Another tear rolls down his cheek. \u201cI only know how to play the xiao, a dizi has a completely different mouthpiece.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cUgh,\u201d Lan Jingyi says. He looks down at his sleeves in despair. He finds a clean corner down at the very bottom of the left one, and uses it to wipe the tears off of Sizhui\u2019s face. He puts his other arm around Sizhui\u2019s shoulders, and shoots a hard look at the other boys. \u201cDon\u2019t be embarrassed,\u201d he says to Sizhui, and gives particularly fierce attention to Shuren. \u201cWe won\u2019t tell Hanguang Jun you can\u2019t play the dizi.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Shuren drops his eyes. Xieren scuffles his feet across the floor. Liuxian bursts into tears, drops his bucket of water, and flings his arms around both Jingyi and Sizhui. After a moment, the other boys kneel down on the wet ground and do the same, and that\u2019s exactly how Lan Zhiyi finds them, a little while later.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">They make for a sorry sight, trudging home as the sun rises. Jingyi came off the worst of it, of course - his whole head wound with bandages, his robes stiff with dried blood and sloughed off pieces of corpse - but Lan Zhiyi had the harder fight and looks almost as battered. Sizhui makes little wheezing noises as he walks, one hand across his ribs to protect where he\u2019d gotten thrown across the room and into a table. The rest of the juniors are dusty and disheveled, and stifling yawns behind their sleeves as they walk. They see a few villagers on their way back - early risers tending to cattle or squatting in their yards, watching over a child or washing clothes - but no one waves. </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">By the time they\u2019re nearly to Cloud Recesses, Jingyi is nearly one of the walking dead himself. He\u2019s looking downwards, watching his sore feet very closely to make sure they don\u2019t make him slip and tumble back down the mountain, so he doesn\u2019t notice that anything is wrong until Lan Zhiyi says, \u201cOh no.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Hanguang Jun is waiting for them at the gates. He\u2019s wrapped in the morning fog, so still that for a moment Jingyi mistakes him for a beautiful statue. The other juniors fall silent as one except for Sizhui, who sucks in a breath so fast that it actually startles Jingyi.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cAre you okay?\u201d he asks in an undertone. \u201cDid you get hurt and not tell me?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cNo,\u201d Sizhui says weakly. He doesn\u2019t look over at Jingyi, but Jingyi sees him wipe his hands off inside his sleeves - like he\u2019s nervous, which is weird.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Hanguang Jun watches them approach and make their bows. His eyes flicker over each of them without a word or change in expression. Jingyi straightens his spine anyway when it\u2019s his turn, trying to hold still - which is <em>very</em> difficult since he\u2019s practically vibrating out of his skin, suddenly awake and eager to tell Hanguang Jun everything that had happened. He fought a fierce corpse! He and Sizhui overpowered it! It was amazing! </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cWait here,\u201d Hanguang Jun says to the juniors, and he and Lan Zhiyi step off of the path and out of earshot. </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">The rest of them mill around the stone steps, not quite daring to sit down and rest. Only Sizhui stands dead still, his hand on his sword and his chin lifted high like he\u2019s pretending to be Hanguang Jun. After a few minutes of this, Jingyi joins him and starts pretending too. They watch Lan Zhiyi make many, many tiny bows as he - Jingyi assumes - explains exactly what happened on the night hunt. Once or twice he gestures at where Jingyi and Sizhui are standing together. Jingyi lifts his chin a little higher and imagines communicating his displeasure with a single wordless <em>look,</em> and having the whole world listen to him. He imagines being tall, and never being questioned. Never being yelled at or made to do anything he wouldn\u2019t want to. He imagines being good and righteous and loved all the time.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jingyi tries looking down his nose, but he only really sees his nose. He nudges Sizhui with his shoulder. \u201cDo you think you\u2019ll be that tall, when you\u2019re older?\u201d he asks. </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cWhat?\u201d Sizhui asks, and gives him a look like Jingyi is crazy. \u201cWhy would I be?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">It\u2019s true that Sizhui is the shortest boy in their class, but there\u2019s no reason to be mad about it. Jingyi sniffs, and practices a cold, haughty expression, like the one Hanguang Jun makes whenever someone wearing Yunmeng Jiang purple robes crosses his path. He nudges Sizhui again. \u201cStop staring,\u201d he says. \u201cThey\u2019ll let us go home when they\u2019re ready.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cHe\u2019s mad,\u201d Sizhui mutters.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cIs he?\u201d Jingyi squints. \u201cAre you sure?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cOh yeah,\u201d Sizhui says, and swallows thickly. </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jingyi squints harder. Hanguang Jun looks the same to him, but he trusts that Sizhui would know. </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Sizhui\u2019s shoulders hitch like he\u2019s about to start crying again, and then he leans in close to Jingyi\u2019s ear to whisper, very rapidly, \u201cI used resentful energy to stop the corpse.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jingyi gives up pretending to be Hanguan Jun so he can stare at his friend. \u201cI know,\u201d he says. </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cI - I don\u2019t know how I did it though,\u201d Sizhui says. \u201cNo one\u2019s ever taught me, I just, I picked up the flute and I knew what to do.\u201d He looks at Jingyi with big and despairing eyes.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jingyi frowns at him. \u201cDo you think Hanguang Jun\u2019s mad at <em>you?\u201d</em> he asks. Sizhui doesn\u2019t say anything, just keeps staring at Jingyi with those big eyes. \u201cUgh, stop,\u201d Jingyi tells him. \u201cWhy would he be mad at you? So what if you used resentful energy? Liuxian stabbed me in the face and my cousin let us fight a corpse by ourselves. <em>You\u2019re</em> fine. You did good!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cJingyi,\u201d Sizhui says, exasperated. </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jingyi sighs very deeply, and very loudly, so that Sizhui will know he means it, and wipe that look off his face. \u201cWhat does Hanguang Jun always tell us?\u201d he demands. \u201cWhat\u2019s the most important thing?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Sizhui\u2019s mouth twists. He\u2019s silent for a long time, thinking it over. His eyes flicker back and forth between Jingyi and Hanguang Jun, uncertainly. He already knows the answer, because he\u2019s the best student in their class, and Jingyi thinks that one day he\u2019ll be just as strong and good as Hanguang Jun. </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cCome home safe,\u201d Sizhui admits. \u201cDo what it takes to make sure <em>everyone</em> comes home. That\u2019s the most important thing.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Jingyi nudges Sizhui with his shoulder for a third time. \u201cSee? You said we\u2019d be fine and we were,\u201d he says, feeling very satisfied. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll have a really great scar to show for it! I don\u2019t really think we\u2019re going to get in trouble, but even if we were, that\u2019s worth getting in a little trouble for. Right?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Sizhui nudges him back, hard enough that he almost sends Jingyi spinning off his feet. He has to shoot a hand out to catch Jingyi, who\u2019s laughing too hard to catch himself. He pats Sizhui\u2019s shoulder. \u201cOkay, okay,\u201d he says. \u201cOh, look, they\u2019re coming back. You better stop fooling around, Lan Sizhui, before Hanguang Jun catches you.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Sizhui almost pushes him off the path again, but they manage to school their expressions before the adults return. Hanguang Jun sweeps another thrillingly majestic look across the lot of them. How does he <em>do it?</em> Doesn\u2019t his own nose get in the way, like Jingyi\u2019s? Jingyi is going to have to practice more. \u201cYou are excused from morning classes,\u201d Hanguang Jun tells them. Is he still mad? Is he mad at them? Jingyi really can\u2019t tell at all. Adults are mad at Jingyi all the time, so he\u2019s pretty used to it, but he\u2019s not sure how he\u2019d feel if Hanguang Jun were mad at him. Pretty terrible, probably. No wonder Sizhui still looks so nervous.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cCome on,\u201d Lan Zhiyi says, and makes a gesture with both hands like he can sweep children up the mountain, like dust. He looks at Sizhui and Jingyi and says, \u201cNot you two. Hanguang Jun will escort you both to see the doctor before you return to the dormitories.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Sizhui bows, and murmurs, \u201cThank you for your guidance, Fifth Senior,\u201d and shoots a look at Jingyi too, like he\u2019s expecting him to forget his manners. As if he would, when Hanguang Jun is standing right there! Jingyi scoffs to himself, and makes an even prettier bow, and says his thanks even more politely.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Then it\u2019s just the three of them, standing together in the morning fog. Jingyi has been awake and sleepy for so long that he\u2019s starting to feel like maybe he\u2019s both awake and asleep at the same time, but he tries to keep his back straight and his eyes open. Sizhui still looks a little scared - they didn\u2019t tell Lan Zhiyi exactly what he\u2019d done to save Jingyi, but he had to know, right? Did he tell Hanguang Jun about it? <em>Are</em> they going to be in trouble? How <em>much</em> trouble?</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Hanguang Jun looks from Sizhui to Jingyi, and says, \u201cGood work.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Lan Jingyi\u2019s soul just about flees from his body. It pushes him up on his toes in excitement and shoves his heart up against his rib cage. Good work! <em>Good work! </em></span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">He looks at Lan Sizhui to share the joy, but Sizhui isn\u2019t looking back - he\u2019s beaming up at Hanguang Jun, like he\u2019s never been scared of anything at all.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p2\" align=\"center\">\n<span class=\"s1\">-</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\"> When Lan Sizhui is sixteen or so, he meets a man in a small village who wears faded, smeared makeup and a smile that never leaves his face. </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Lan Sizhui likes him immediately. He likes the rapid way the man speaks, the lofty arrogance of his tone, so far above his station and the circumstances they find him in. He pities the way the man cringes away from something as simple as a hand to help him to his feet, and how he greets Sizhui\u2019s courtesy with an odd, quiet puzzlement. He admires the quickness of the man\u2019s mind: the neatness of his explanation of the stone goddess on Dafan Mountain, and the way he\u2019d twisted out of Sandu Shengshou\u2019s claws. </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Then they bring the man back to the Cloud Recesses. Back to the Jingshi. </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Sizhui wakes early, the morning after Mo Xuanyu comes to Gusu. The dormitory is silent, filled only with the breathing of the other junior disciples, as soft as clouds except for Jingyi, who whistles through his nose as he sleeps. He stares at the ceiling for a long time, watching the wood warm with the approaching sun. </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">He shouldn\u2019t concern himself with the private affairs of others. </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">But even Uncle had said how unusual it was. That Father had never brought guests back to Cloud Recesses before. </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">And Sizhui had liked Mo Xuanyu - immediately, immensely - and he knew they had to protect the poor man from Sandu Shengshou\u2019s paranoia, but - </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">But Mo Xuanyu had spent the night in the Jingshi, where no one except Sizhui was normally allowed to go.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">It\u2019s not like Sizhui is stupid. He knows what cutsleeves do. He knows that Father has never had a wife but that he\u2019d lost <em>someone,</em> and Sizhui has wondered, just a little bit, if there\u2019s a reason why no one seems to speak this person\u2019s name. If it wasn\u2019t Sizhui\u2019s mother, maybe it had been his father. Or maybe -</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">He\u2019s almost asked, so many times: who this person was, how long they\u2019d known each other, how this person had died. How it was possible to still wear white for them, even after so many years. He wants to know about a love like that.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">He doesn\u2019t know how to reconcile that with Mo Xuanyu, mercurial and clever, dragged into Cloud Recesses in the throes of the fakest hysterics Sizhui has ever seen. Father had watched the juniors wrestle Mo Xuanyu all the way up the mountain, and he\u2019d ignored Sizhui completely while they did it. Uncle had only sighed, and looked heavenward, and then patted Sizhui\u2019s shoulder and told him not to worry. Maybe he hadn\u2019t realized exactly where they\u2019d been taking Mo Xuanyu. Maybe Sizhui was just breaking rules, putting his nose in other people\u2019s business.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Sizhui sighs and slips out of bed. He combs his hair and fixes his forehead ribbon. He breathes deeply in through his nose, and closes his eyes as he exhales. It helps a little, but the feeling of strangeness doesn\u2019t leave even as he closes the doors behind himself, or as he traces the well-worn, winding path from the dormitory to his childhood home. Instead, it clings to his white-robed shoulders like mist, or rabbits\u2019 fur. He knows that if he can only talk to Father privately he\u2019ll feel better, and as the path gets steeper his steps quicken. The sun is burning through the fog, and when he finally sees the Jingshi\u2019s thick brush fence and white stone garden, his heart squeezes gladly. </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">And then falters.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">For a long moment Lan Sizhui is frozen, one foot through the Jingshi\u2019s gate and the other lifted to complete the step, only his toes still resting on the ground. His breath feels caught in his chest, even though he can see the steam of his own exhales in the morning air. If you asked him to explain his hesitation, he might not have the words - but he probably wouldn't even really need them. The sight that greets him as he walked through the gate would make anyone in Cloud Recesses stop dead and stare.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">The door to the Jingshi is open to the sunlight, and Father is standing out on the long deck. He\u2019s dressed in the sort of light robe that he might wear only at home, or walking to and from the cold springs. His hair is pulled up in a loose half knot, free of ornamentation. His eyes are closed, and his face is tilted up to greet the sunshine, and he\u2019s smiling.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Lan Sizhui takes a step closer, and another. He sets his feet lightly, carefully on the stone. He watches Father closely, as if his smile were a particularly timid rabbit that might startle and vanish at any moment. But it doesn\u2019t - it stays, so warm and soft around his mouth and eyes, as Sizhui climbs the low steps of the Jingshi and comes to stand at his father\u2019s side. Sizhui knows he\u2019s staring. He feels his mouth hanging open in astonishment. His hands make damp fists inside his sleeves, self-consciously. He reaches instinctively for the soft pouch he always keeps in there, and the old, crumpled grass toy inside of it that he\u2019s had for longer than he can remember, which always makes him feel better. </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Father opens his eyes. They\u2019re cut through with sunlight, which turns his eyes into polished glass, with little bits of gold and green and brown throughout. He looks down at Lan Sizhui, who can\u2019t help but smile back at him, wide and helpless and weirdly overwhelmed. After a moment it\u2019s too much, and Sizhui looks away, into the Jingshi where it\u2019s dark and quiet. \u201cIs Senior Mo still sleeping?\u201d he asks.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Father nods, and then reaches behind himself and slides the door closed. \u201cHe\u2019ll sleep for a few more hours,\u201d he says - and there, at the corner of his mouth, the smile gets fonder, turns up at one corner. Sizhui watches it, fascinated. Father says, \u201cArrange for breakfast to be brought at nine.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cNine?\u201d Sizhui repeats, unsure if he heard right. \u201cAre you sure? That\u2019s so late ...\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Father nods. He moves away from the door, and Sizhui follows automatically. \u201cThere should be some chili oil leftover from the Qinghe Nie delegation two weeks ago,\u201d Father tells him. \u201cAsk the cook to include some with the meal.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cOkay,\u201d Sizhui says faintly. \u201cBut Father -\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">A strange look passes over Father\u2019s face, and he turns and faces Sizhui fully. Sizhui straightens automatically, unsure of what he\u2019s looking for. Father\u2019s scrutiny sometimes makes him feel like his forehead ribbon is crooked, even though he knows it isn\u2019t. He feels impatient, too - full of questions he doesn\u2019t know how to ask. </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cA-Yuan,\u201d Father says abruptly. </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">He doesn\u2019t usually call Sizhui by his birth name, even when it\u2019s just the two of them, so to hear it is kind of alarming, on top of everything else that\u2019s happened since yesterday. \u201cYes?\u201d Sizhui asks. He looks over his shoulder, at the white eyes of the Jingshi\u2019s paper windows.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cA-Yuan,\u201d Father says again, urgently. Startled, Sizhui looks back at him.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">They watch each other for a long moment. The tension and curiosity in Sizhui\u2019s heart stretches like spun sugar, almost to a breaking point. Words crowd up his throat and into his mouth, jockeying for position. He thinks, maybe, that Father is feeling the same: after a lifetime of exposure, he can pick out <em>anxiety</em> on Father\u2019s brow and <em>worry</em> in his eyes. He\u2019s scared about something - scared for <em>Sizhui.</em> But there, tucked like a secret in the corner of his mouth - that\u2019s something else. Something Sizhui has never seen before.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cAre you,\u201d Sizhui asks, tentatively, and his head says, <em>Okay?</em> And his heart asks, <em>Happy? </em></span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">In the end he can\u2019t say either one. He looks at his father, helplessly silent, and his father looks back at him, and, slowly, the worry fades again, for both of them.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">Sizhhui laughs. It bubbles up unexpectedly from his chest, surprising him. Father only nods, like Sizhui had asked his questions after all. \u201cIt\u2019s early,\u201d he says, and turns away, starting down the Jingshi\u2019s steps. \u201cWe will feed the rabbits.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\n<span class=\"s1\">\u201cYes, Father,\u201d Sizhui says, still smiling, and they fall in step together.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u00a0</p>"
