  "summary": "<p>Bakugou Katsuki, in typical fashion, makes a brash decision that changes his life irrevocably. Anger has always had a way of bringing Bakugou what he wants, though. He just hadn't realized dating someone would be so fucking difficult.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>(Or, that one where Bakugou agrees to pretend to date Todoroki just to piss off Endeavor, and ends up falling in love instead.)</p>",
  "notes": "<p>Happy (belated) TodoBaku Week. Day six brought to you by the prompt: Family. </p>\n<p>Lord have mercy on me, this fic was originally going to be fairly short and then it just kept going and going and then it became SMUT and eventually it was 20k. Have you ever written so much in such a short amount of time that you don't even know if it's making sense anymore? That's where I'm at. Yet again. Ffffffffff</p>\n<p>I'm also dedicating this fic to mybrainproblems, who honestly gave me the entire inspiration for this story. Our mutual hatred of Endeavor has brought something useful to the fandom, I hope, lmfao. ILU FRIEND.</p>\n<p class=\"jump\">(See the end of the work for <a href=\"#work_endnotes\">more notes</a>.)</p>\n<p>For the love of all that is holy, please come scream at me about bnha on tumblr.

  "text": "<p>Bakugou was wandering around the dorms of U.A. aimlessly on a day much like any other when he made a decision that would change his life irrevocably.</p>\n<p>He had been walking the hallways in an effort to stretch his legs after finishing up an assignment, hoping to relieve some of the built-up frustration that came with working on math for several hours. It was an unusually hot day, the kind that left a strong feeling of discomfort lingering in the air even when Bakugou was nice and comfortable inside his dorm room, AC cranked up to the max. As a result, he was already in a pretty terrible fucking mood, truth be told, but he was also feeling exceptionally good because he <em>knew</em> without a doubt he\u2019d at least done the homework perfectly.</p>\n<p>Bakugou loved being right. Specifically, Bakugou loved being more right than everyone else. Being the best was a better feeling than just about anything else he\u2019d ever known.</p>\n<p>This combination of emotions lead to what Kirishima sometimes called Bakugou\u2019s worst mood of all: the sort where he went out looking for a fight because he was convinced he could win.</p>\n<p>He wasn\u2019t <em>actively</em> seeking out a confrontation, though. After three years, getting yelled at by Aizawa was starting to lose it\u2019s charm, so picking a fight needlessly wasn\u2019t \u00a0exactly something he was intent on. But maybe he\u2019d stumble on some poor soul who was also out wandering the halls, and who would be foolish enough to agree to spar with him.</p>\n<p>Or maybe he\u2019d just hit the kitchen and grab some food.</p>\n<p>He was feeling unpredictable like that.</p>\n<p>As he rounded the corner of the bottom stairwell connecting to the downstairs lobby, Bakugou heard raised voices coming from near the front doors. He recognized one raised voice in particular immediately as Todoroki\u2019s, Bakugou\u2019s hair raising on end at the unexpected anger he could hear even from where he stood. The other voice Bakugou was less familiar with, but it was still one he\u2019d recognize anywhere from countless hours watching him on TV growing up.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m tired of this rebellious behavior, Shouto,\u201d Endeavor\u2019s voice rang, loud enough to echo through the open space of the lobby. \u201cYou will go to the omiai.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI am not a <em>child</em> anymore, father,\u201d Todoroki\u2019s disembodied voice replied, clearly aggitated. \u201cI refuse.\u201d</p>\n<p>Bakugou felt his hackles rise for some inexplicable reason.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou <em>will </em>marry a woman who will bring you strong heirs, Shouto. I won\u2019t hear any arguments about this,\u201d Endeavor replied. As though this were obvious and Todoroki should already know it. As if he didn\u2019t have a fucking say in his own life at all. \u201cThere is no one else better suited to mix your quirk with. You will attend. I won\u2019t take no for an answer.\u201d</p>\n<p>Bakugou peered surreptitiously around the corner before padding forward quietly, somehow instinctively knowing Todoroki\u2019s next response would be harder to hear if he didn\u2019t.</p>\n<p>This wasn\u2019t eaves-dropping, he told himself. He wasn\u2019t being <em>rude</em> by listening in. Hell, they were standing in the middle of the goddamn foyer; their conversation wasn\u2019t exactly <em>private</em> in the first place.</p>\n<p>But Bakugou couldn\u2019t deny he had a personal investment in hearing what was taking place, either. Ever since their first year in school, Bakugou had born a powerful hatred of Endeavor. He hadn\u2019t liked him well before that, but once he\u2019d seen how he treated his son, that dislike had turned into an active feeling so powerful it was nearly visceral at times.</p>\n<p>Like now, for example.</p>\n<p>Bakugou didn\u2019t feel particularly endeared towards Todoroki most of the time. They\u2019d reached a tentative state of truce over the years, their relationship fading from outright hostility to civil rivalry and slowly into an unspoken mutual respect.</p>\n<p>That didn\u2019t make them friends, though. Bakugou shouldn\u2019t really care what happened between Todoroki and his father.</p>\n<p>But he did. Intensely. At least when it came to this, for reasons he couldn\u2019t fully explain.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to marry a woman who will give me strong heirs,\u201d Todoroki responded through what sounded like gritted teeth, \u201cBecause I won\u2019t be marrying a <em>woman</em>. I\u2019m <em>gay</em>, father. I have <em>told</em> you this. Many times, in fact. It\u2019s not something I can change or help.\u201d</p>\n<p>Bakugou felt his eyebrows climb into his hairline. Well, that wasn\u2019t something he had ever been sure about, but he\u2019d always had his suspicions. He suddenly felt a kinship with Todoroki he hadn\u2019t known he\u2019d even been capable of until that moment.</p>\n<p>\u201cI won\u2019t hear any more of this <em>nonsense</em>, Shouto,\u201d Endeavor boomed, Bakugou watching as Todoroki flinched back in response. \u201cYou will marry whoever I say. I will not have my son be so disgraceful as to lay with another man.\u201d</p>\n<p>Bakugou felt like he\u2019d been stabbed in the gut, something in him that had been wrought tight suddenly snapping like a frayed wire.</p>\n<p>Maybe it was the mood he\u2019d already been in earlier, maybe it was the idea that Endeavor was trying to make something so fucking unimportant and perfectly normal into something so shameful, or maybe it was the idea that Todoroki would flinch away from absolutely <em>anyone</em>, but Bakugou was suddenly prepared to do whatever he had to do to make sure Endeavor regretted ever having uttered those fucking words.</p>\n<p>Without further thought, he marched straight up to Todoroki, wrapping one arm around his waist before dropping his chin to rest possessively on his shoulder. \u201cHey, babe. You didn\u2019t tell me your dad was coming by today,\u201d he said, voice flat and eyes hard.</p>\n<p>\u201cB-Bakugou?\u201d Todoroki stammered, turning his head to look at him with wide eyes.</p>\n<p>But Bakugou wasn\u2019t looking at Todoroki. Bakugou was looking at Endeavor.</p>\n<p>He smiled, knowing the expression was anything but friendly. \u201cHello, <em>dad</em>,\u201d Bakugou said, eyes dancing with barely-suppressed rage. \u201cI\u2019m sure you already know who I am, but let me reintroduce myself. I\u2019m Bakugou Katsuki, Shouto\u2019s boyfriend.\u201d</p>\n<p>He felt Todoroki seize up beneath him, but he made no move to pull away. Bakugou didn\u2019t know what to make of that, but continued talking anyway.</p>\n<p>\u201cGreat to see you again,\u201d Bakugou finished, voice full of false cheer. \u201cLooking forward to being a part of the family someday.\u201d</p>\n<p>It wasn\u2019t often Bakugou had the chance to show up the world\u2019s Number Two hero, but based on the look Endeavor was currently sporting, he was pretty confident he could mark this moment down as a life achievement.</p>\n<p>Endeavor\u2019s face was red\u2014not with flame, but with anger. He looked like he was about to have a fucking aneurism, much to Bakugou\u2019s amusement. Bakugou didn\u2019t bother to suppress his grin, which was a lot more of a threat than it was a friendly gesture, teeth sharp and gleaming.</p>\n<p>Endeavor shook with visible outrage, his skin mottled, eyes burning. \u201cShouto. <em>What</em> is the meaning of this?\u201d</p>\n<p>Bakugou opened his mouth to reply, assuming Todoroki would be too baffled and probably weirded out to respond himself, but was shocked when he felt a sudden pressure against the top of his head, Todoroki tilting his own to rest it against Bakugou\u2019s. One of his hands came to rest on top of his where it rested against Todoroki\u2019s waist, entertwining their fingers as if it was the most natural thing in the world. \u201cPrecisely what it sounds like, father. This is my boyfriend, Bakugou Katsuki.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBoyfriend?\u201d Endeavor repeated, as though he couldn\u2019t comprehend it.</p>\n<p>Todoroki made a motion that felt like a careless shrug. \u201cI did try to tell you, but you wouldn\u2019t listen.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut\u2014he can\u2019t <em>possibly</em> be, he\u2019s\u2014\u201c</p>\n<p>\u201cYep, his boyfriend,\u201d Bakugou confirmed. \u201cSo I\u2019d appreciate it if you\u2019d stop trying to get him to date women and shit. Otherwise we\u2019re gonna have ourselves a problem, <em>dad.</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>Endeavor\u2019s face contorted at the word, and Bakugou felt a spike of absolute glee shoot through his veins. It was probably that sense of victory going to his head that made his next action seem perfectly reasonable.</p>\n<p>He turned slightly, jostling Todoroki just enough to reach up and plant a kiss on the side of his face. The fingers around his own squeezed reflexively in surprise, but again, Todoroki made no move to pull away from him.</p>\n<p>\u201cBecause he\u2019s <em>mine</em>,\u201d Bakugou continued darkly, lips brushing Todoroki\u2019s skin with every word. He shot a look at Endeavor from the corner of his eyes, voice low. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t take kindly to people taking shit from me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Endeavor opened his mouth and closed it several times, clearly attempting to find something to say to this but apparently beyond comprehensible thought or speech.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>We will discuss this later</em>,\u201d he finally managed to hiss at Todoroki before he turned abruptly on his heel and marched out the front door, not bothering to look back even once, the door slamming shut behind him with a sense of finality.</p>\n<p>Neither of them moved or said anything until he was out of sight, Bakugou suddenly hit with the realization that he had maybe, <em>possibly</em>, over-stepped his bounds.</p>\n<p>He\u2019d just gone and done that. Even <em>he </em>almost couldn\u2019t believe it.</p>\n<p>Fuck.</p>\n<p>Well, at least his itch to fight had been scratched, he supposed.</p>\n<p>He loosened his hold on Todoroki, pulling away slightly but stopping when he realized Todoroki was shaking.</p>\n<p>Oh, god. <em>Fuck</em>, what were people supposed to do in this kind of situation? Bakugou hadn\u2019t signed up for <em>crying</em> today, no fucking thank you, and yet he somehow felt responsible enough that he was obligated to do something about it.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey, uh,\u201d he began, not sure where the hell he was going with this. \u201cAre you fucking ok?\u201d</p>\n<p>Todoroki suddenly threw his head back, the widest grin Bakugou had ever seen on his face as he laughed, full-bodied, hands clutching his stomach, the sound of his laughter ringing throughout the hallway radiantly.</p>\n<p>The sight of it stole the breath from Bakugou\u2019s lungs, and apparently took Bakugou\u2019s remaining sanity along with it. Because all he could think as he watched Todoroki giggling like a fucking child was how captivating he looked when he laughed like that.</p>\n<p>After a moment Bakugou realized he, too, was grinning, a surprised snort escaping him before he could stop it.</p>\n<p>Todoroki looked up at him at the sound, their eyes locking briefly.</p>\n<p>And then they were both doubled over, Bakugou cackling, Todoroki wheezing with laughter until tears threatened to leak from the corners of his eyes.</p>\n<p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe that just fucking happened,\u201d Bakugou gasped once he\u2019d calmed down slightly, still grinning at the memory of Endeavor\u2019s scandalized expression.</p>\n<p>Todoroki snorted, breath labored as he tried to get himself under control. \u201cI\u2014I can\u2019t believe you <em>did </em>that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFuck, me either,\u201d Bakugou admitted in a rare show of honesty, likely due to the euphoria he was experiencing. \u201cHe just really pissed me off.\u201d</p>\n<p>Awareness seemed to return to Todoroki abruptly, his expression sobering and turning cautiously curious as he gazed at Bakugou.</p>\n<p>Bakugou could immediately tell they were about to have some kind of <em>talk</em> about feelings and shit, and as a result he instantly felt uncomfortable.</p>\n<p>Fuck. This is why he didn\u2019t get involved in other people\u2019s shit.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat did he do to piss you off?\u201d Todoroki asked, seeming genuinely confused.</p>\n<p>Ugh. Jesus, he hated conversations like this.</p>\n<p>He scrubbed a hand angrily through his hair, groaning. \u201cFuck, I don\u2019t know, everything?\u201d</p>\n<p>He received a questioning look in response. This asshole wasn\u2019t going to give up unless he got a real answer, he knew. Todoroki was annoyingly persistent when he wanted to be.</p>\n<p>\n<em>Fuck my life.This is why I\u2019m never nice to anyone.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u201cI didn\u2019t like the way he was talking to you. Like you were fucking\u2014fucking <em>property</em> or something,\u201d Bakugou spat, turning to glare at the front door and wishing he could\u2019ve punched Endeavor just once. \u201cYou can do whatever you want and fuck whoever you like, and he should keep his fucking nose out of it.\u201d</p>\n<p>There was silence following this statement. He turned, jolting when he found Todoroki looking at him with something close to awe. Like he\u2019d never really seen Bakugou before this moment and was now pleasantly surprised by what he found.</p>\n<p>Which was just wrong. Bakugou wasn\u2019t a nice person. He didn\u2019t deserve to be looked at like that. Not for that reason, at least. It was just common sense. Just because Endeavor didn\u2019t possess a shred of decency didn\u2019t mean Bakugou deserved a medal because he did.</p>\n<p>Yet he couldn\u2019t stop himself from adding, \u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with being gay, alright? So don\u2019t let that fucker make you feel stupid about it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Todoroki\u2019s eyes widened further, like he couldn\u2019t believe what he was hearing.</p>\n<p>\u201cFuck, whatever. That\u2019s all I\u2019m saying about it,\u201d Bakugou mumbled, turning away. He was prepared to march straight back up to his room but froze when a hand clasped firmly around his wrist.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2014I know you don\u2019t like talking about things like this. Or to me,\u201d Todoroki added as an afterthought. \u201cBut I want you to know that I am sincerely grateful for what you did. That was the greatest moment of my life, I think.\u201d</p>\n<p>Bakugou flushed, something pleasant thrumming in his chest at the words, but he didn\u2019t turn around. \u201cYeah, well. If you ever need a fake boyfriend again,\u201d he mumbled, waiving his free hand around as if that explained absolutely anything.</p>\n<p>It apparently did, though, because Todoroki slowly let him go. \u201cYeah. Ok,\u201d he mumbled, voice soft.</p>\n<p>Without looking back, Bakugou made a hasty retreat to his room, practically running most of the way there. He slammed his door closed before dropping heavily onto his bed to stare at the ceiling.</p>\n<p>He had no idea what he\u2019d just done. Not really. But something in his gut told him that what he\u2019d done was more serious than he\u2019d first realized, and that he couldn\u2019t take back.</p>\n<p>He didn\u2019t know how he felt about that.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>A week later and Bakugou had mostly forgotten the incident. School had a way of distracting him from most personal problems in his life simply because he was determined to be the best in the class and spent a shitload of his time studying as a result.</p>\n<p>He also occasionally threw himself into school work and hero training as a way to distract himself from said personal problems, but no one <em>else </em>had to know that.</p>\n<p>So a week later, when he was in his room studying late one night, he was not too shocked to hear a knock on his door. Probably Kirishima wanting to see his answers to the calculus homework, he figured.</p>\n<p>He <em>was </em>shocked when he opened the door to find Todoroki fucking Shouto standing there instead. Todoroki looked almost as surprised as he was, mouth hanging open a little, his eyes looking Bakugou up and down.</p>\n<p>Bakugou blinked, looking down at himself and remembering he was wearing nothing but his boxers and one of his fitted black tank tops. It was fucking <em>hot out</em>, what was he supposed to do?</p>\n<p>\u201cThe fuck do you want?\u201d Bakugou bit out, trying not to feel self-conscious.</p>\n<p>Todoroki\u2019s eyes snapped up to look him in the face at the words as if suddenly remembering himself. \u201cI, um. May I come in? I had something I wanted to\u2026 discuss with you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAm I going to like this?\u201d Bakugou asked, feeling a headache rapidly coming on.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo. Probably not.\u201d</p>\n<p>For fuck\u2019s sake.</p>\n<p>He sighed, giving a long groan as he weighed his options, his fingers rubbing at the crease between his brows. Slam the door in Todoroki\u2019s face, or invite him in and figure out what the fuck was going on?</p>\n<p>Curiosity won out, much to Bakugou\u2019s annoyance. He opened the door wider, gesturing sharply at Todoroki to come in wordlessly.</p>\n<p>Todoroki stepped swiftly across the threshold and into the room as though afraid Bakugou might change his mind if he didn\u2019t hurry, stopping to stand awkwardly in the center of the dorm as Bakugou slammed the door closed behind them.</p>\n<p>Bakugou leaned back against the wall beside the door, crossing his arms over his chest and cocking one hip. \u201cAlright, asshole. Talk.\u201d</p>\n<p>Todoroki looked uncomfortable, his shoulders tense, a slight frown turning down the corners of his mouth. He swallowed visibly, seeming to steel himself. \u201cRight. I wanted to ask you if\u2014if\u2014\u201c</p>\n<p>His fists clenched at his sides, like he was struggling to force the words out.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou said I could come to you if I ever needed a fake boyfriend again,\u201d he said in a sudden rush. \u201cWere you\u2026 serious about that?\u201d</p>\n<p>Bakugou felt his eyes widen, his arms dropping to his sides in surprise. <em>Was</em> he serious about that?</p>\n<p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t <em>not</em> serious. I guess,\u201d he said, thinking aloud and finding it was true.</p>\n<p>Todoroki nodded, looking relieved. \u201cIf that\u2019s the case, then I may have a favor to ask you.\u201d</p>\n<p>A sense of foreboding loomed over Bakugou. Sadly, caution wasn\u2019t something really in his vocabulary.</p>\n<p>He sighed, walking across the room to sit on the edge of his bed, gesturing vaguely at Todoroki to take his desk chair. \u201cSit the fuck down and explain what the hell you\u2019re talking about.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAlright. But first, I\u2019m going to ask you something because it\u2019s\u2026 it\u2019s bothering me, to be honest, and I also want to avoid making you unnecessarily uncomfortable,\u201d Todoroki said as he pulled out the chair, straddling it to face Bakugou and gripping the back of the seat hard enough that his knuckles were white.</p>\n<p>\u201cKay,\u201d Bakugou said, annoyed. \u201cJust fucking ask me, idiot. I\u2019m <em>already</em> fucking uncomfortable as it is.\u201d</p>\n<p>Todoroki sighed, sounding pained. \u201cAre you gay, Bakugou?\u201d</p>\n<p>Bakugou felt his eye twitch.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhelp, you\u2019re right. I\u2019m definitely fucking uncomfortable as hell now,\u201d Bakugou groused, closing his eyes and rubbing at his forehead, because he now had a full-on headache pounding behind his eyeballs. \u201cJesus christ, I hate that we even have to talk about shit like this.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to answer if you don\u2019t want to,\u201dTodoroki said, sounding embarrassed. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have asked something so personal. I just\u2014\u201c</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not fucking gay, idiot,\u201d Bakugou sighed. \u201cI\u2019m also not straight. Alright? Happy?\u201d</p>\n<p>He opened his eyes to find Todoroki blinking at him, that same look on his face from the week before, when he\u2019d looked like he was really seeing Bakugou like he\u2019d never actually <em>looked</em> until just then.</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t fucking care what\u2019s in someone\u2019s pants,\u201d Bakugou clarified, irritated beyond all reason. \u201cAs long as someone is strong, smart, dedicated, and reasonably attractive, I\u2019d probably like them. Doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019d date everyone though. Most people are fucking horrible to deal with outside of sex.\u201d</p>\n<p>Silence followed this statement before Todoroki suddenly huffed, a small smile gracing his features.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2026 somehow it\u2019s both surprising and yet not to hear you say that,\u201d he admitted.</p>\n<p>Bakugou shrugged. <em>Uncomfortably</em>. Because they were talking about feelings and personal shit and this was starting to feel suspiciously like a bonding moment.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo what was the point of you asking me this shit again?\u201d he prompted, voice strained.</p>\n<p>Todoroki shook his head as if to clear it. \u201cI wanted to make sure my real purpose wouldn\u2019t make you uncomfortable before I bothered to ask. And now that I\u2019ve ascertained that I\u2019m at least not outright excluded from your criteria,\u201d he murmured, eyes trained on Bakugou with such intensity that he felt like Todoroki was attempting to see into his soul. \u201cWould you mind pretending to be my boyfriend again? Perhaps on a more\u2026 extended basis?\u201d</p>\n<p>Bakugou blanched, not fully understanding. His face must have conveyed his confusion well enough, because Todoroki rushed to explain.</p>\n<p>\u201cMy father is attempting to manipulate me into marriage to a woman I have never even met and have no desire to spend the rest of my life with. I have thought about this long and hard, and the only way I can think to stop him is to out myself. Publically.\u201d</p>\n<p>Bakugou\u2019s eyes widened, understanding dawning on him as Todoroki continued to speak.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat I\u2019m asking for you to do is to pretend to go on dates with me where reporters might catch a glimpse of us. They will be tipped off ahead of time, of course. My father will be unable to force a marriage on me without hurting his own hero image socially, so this is the only real pressure I am able to put on him in order to make him stop pursuing his little <em>project</em>,\u201d Todoroki said, venom dripping off the last word.</p>\n<p>\u201cBut in doing so, you will basically be my official boyfriend, according to the public. And as a result, you will be outed as well.\u201d</p>\n<p>He couldn\u2019t believe what he was hearing. Frankly, it was an excellent plan, and Bakugou could completely see the merit in it. He just absolutely hated the idea that <em>he </em>was the one who had to take part as Todoroki\u2019s significant other.</p>\n<p>\u201cI am aware that this is a lot to ask of you, and I\u2019m not exactly thrilled to be putting myself in your debt here. But if you do this,\u201d Todoroki said, swallowing, his eyes dancing with something that wasn\u2019t quite fear but was definitely something close to it, \u201cI will grant you any one request.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou want me to be your boyfriend, and take you on dates and do couple shit with you,\u201d Bakugou summarized, \u201cAnd in return, I get a favor from you back?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Any one request</em>,\u201d Todoroki emphasized. \u201cIt can be anything. I will do whatever you want without question.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo if I asked you to intentionally let me have the number one hero spot, you\u2019d step down and give it to me?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d Todoroki said without hesitation, though his eyes hardened. \u201cI would.\u201d</p>\n<p>Bakugou felt his throat close up. He would never actually use something so fucking underhanded to win the number one spot, but just knowing that Todoroki was willing to give that up if it meant Bakugou agreed to help him with this made made Bakugou realize how serious he was.</p>\n<p>It also made him weirdly aware of two things:</p>\n<p>1.Todoroki desperately needed his help. Him, Bakugou, and no one else. It made Bakugou feel strangely important to Todoroki in a way he had never anticipated he would be, suddenly holding a spot of such significance in the life of someone he had previously tried to keep at arms length.</p>\n<p>2. Bakugou hated helping people unless he had a very good reason for doing so. Those reasons were nearly always to his benefit in some way, and while Todoroki was offering him a very serious consolation prize for participating in this, Bakugou realized some part of him wanted to help even if he got nothing in return.</p>\n<p>Maybe it was just the thought of how much this would inevitably piss off Endeavor. That alone was a strong motivator. Bakugou wanted to believe that was his reason and not something as stupid and weird as actually giving a shit about Todoroki.</p>\n<p>Which he didn\u2019t. <em>Obviously.</em></p>\n<p>\u201cFine,\u201d he blurted abruptly. \u201cI\u2019ll do it. But you <em>will </em>owe me for it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Todoroki\u2019s mouth dropped open. His hands clutched at the wood of the desk chair so hard it was a wonder he didn\u2019t somehow snap it in half. \u201cYou will? You really will?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI just fucking said I would, didn\u2019t I?\u201d Bakugou hissed, turning his head away in embarrassment. Because now his brain was supplying him with all kinds of useless images of him and Todoroki doing stupid mushy couple <em>things</em> and it was so gross and disgusting it was making his heart race.</p>\n<p>\u201cSorry, I just didn\u2019t think you\u2019d actually agree. At least, not that easily,\u201d Todoroki acknowledged.</p>\n<p>Bakugou huffed, indignant, but didn\u2019t feel up to arguing any more just then. \u201cCan we maybe finish talking about this some other time? Never, preferably, but definitely not <em>right fucking now</em>?\u201d</p>\n<p>Todoroki snorted, standing up from the chair. \u201cWe can discuss the details later, I suppose.\u201d</p>\n<p>Bakugou felt a childish urge to trip Todoroki as he walked across the room towards the door. He didn\u2019t like how fucking amused and <em>pleased</em> Todoroki seemed to be by the whole thing.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll text you later, then?\u201d he asked as he swung the door open, glancing back to give Bakugou one last lingering look.</p>\n<p>Bakugou scowled. \u201cDo whatever you want. Just get out of my room.\u201d</p>\n<p>The door closed, leaving Bakugou with the image of Todoroki\u2019s smile flashing just before he disappeared from sight.</p>\n<p>He flopped back heavily against his bed, arms splayed out. His head was fucking pounding, his heart racing, blood rushing in his ears.</p>\n<p>None of this really made a lot of sense to Bakugou, and yet for some reason, he found he was weirdly excited by the whole thing.</p>\n<p>He wouldn\u2019t admit to that aloud even under threat of death, however.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He was sitting at lunch the next day with Kirishima and Kaminari when his phone vibrated in his pocket. Which was unusual, because only a handful of people texted him, and he could see them all in the lunch room at that very moment.</p>\n<p>He pulled it out curiously, attempting to keep the two idiots at his table from noticing what he was doing. Which wasn\u2019t too hard, given that they were in the middle of flirting obnoxiously with one another.</p>\n<p><strong>[Half \u2018n Half]: </strong>Are you free this coming Saturday?</p>\n<p>Bakugou frowned. He\u2019d forgotten he even had Todoroki\u2019s number in his phone.</p>\n<p><strong>[Explodo-King]: </strong>yeah i guess im free why?</p>\n<p>Barely ten seconds went by before his phone jolted with a reply.</p>\n<p><strong>[Half \u2018n Half]: </strong>I\u2019d like to go on our first date, if you\u2019re willing.</p>\n<p>Bakugou felt his face redden immediately, his hand gripping his phone hard enough to threaten to break the damn thing.</p>\n<p>Right. They had to go on a date. He was <em>aware </em>of this. He just hadn\u2019t thought it would happen so soon.</p>\n<p>He didn\u2019t feel mentally prepared. Which was stupid, because Bakugou believed in being prepared for anything at all times. He replied immediately, largely out of spite for himself.</p>\n<p><strong>[Explodo-King]:</strong> fuck, fine i guess. when and where?</p>\n<p><strong>[Half \u2018n Half]: </strong>I was thinking something simple. Maybe coffee in the evening, if that works for you.</p>\n<p><strong>[Explodo-King]: </strong>whatever, idc. meet me in front of the dorms at 6 then.</p>\n<p><strong>[Half \u2018n Half]: </strong>Alright.</p>\n<p>Bakugou stared at his phone, feeling awkward. The conversation seemed over, but also ended abruptly enough that he felt like he should be saying something else, though he wasn\u2019t sure what.</p>\n<p>Christ. Even <em>fake </em>dating was hard. He couldn\u2019t imagine doing this shit for real.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy are you making that face?\u201d Kirishima asked suddenly, jarring Bakugou out of his thoughts.</p>\n<p>He stuffed his phone hastily back into his pocket. \u201cWhat fucking face, shitty hair?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou know, the stupid one,\u201d Kaminari replied, waving a hand at him as if that explained everything. Beside him, Kirishima nodded as though it actually <em>did.</em></p>\n<p>Bakugou glared. \u201cDo you want to finish the rest of your lunch, or d\u2019ya want to watch it go up in flames, asshole?\u201d</p>\n<p>Kaminari\u2019s mouth shut immediately, though he still looked pleased with himself. Bakugou didn\u2019t miss the fact that he surreptitiously scooted his plate closer to himself, however.</p>\n<p>\u201cSeriously though man, what\u2019s up? You\u2019ve been staring at your phone for a while now. Everything ok?\u201d Kirishima asked, eyes gleaming with genuine concern and affection.</p>\n<p>Bakugou suddenly realized that he and Todoroki had neglected to discuss a very important aspect of this whole dating bullshit, which was what they were supposed to tell their friends. Or if they were supposed to tell them at all, though he had a feeling they\u2019d find out once this shit all hit the news\u2014which Bakugou knew without a doubt it would.</p>\n<p>\u201cCan\u2019t talk about it,\u201d Bakugou mumbled, stuffing a spoonful of spicy curry into his mouth. He chewed, watching Kirishima and Kaminari\u2019s eyebrows draw together in concern and knowing they weren\u2019t going to shut up about it now. \u201cI\u2019m fuckin serious, I can\u2019t tell you right now, alright? Christ. Everything\u2019s fine, just\u2014just fucking be patient or something and I\u2019ll tell you when I can.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThis is sounding way more serious than I thought it was gonna be,\u201d Kaminari said.</p>\n<p>Kirishima was frowning. \u201cYeah. I thought you were gonna tell me your battery was dying or something. What the hell is going on, dude?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat did I <em>just fucking say</em>?\u201d Bakugou hissed, pounding his fist on the table. \u201c<em>I will tell you later.</em> I\u2019m not gonna talk about this right now so just fucking let it go.\u201d</p>\n<p>The mood surrounding their lunch table was tense, but after a minute Kirishima sighed, deflating. \u201cAlright. I trust you, man.\u201d</p>\n<p>Kaminari snorted. \u201cThat\u2019s going a little far, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShut the fuck up,\u201d Bakugou bit out without much heat, kicking Kaminari under the table, who winced and grabbed at his shin in response, Kirishima offering to kiss it better immediately, Bakugou rolling his eyes.</p>\n<p>The two of them lapsed into banter, leaving Bakugou with his thoughts. Which he supposed was kind of nice of them, but it also meant that Bakugou actually had time to think, which he sort of hated.</p>\n<p>Saturday. That was only a few days away.</p>\n<p>Fuck.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The rest of the week passed in a blur of school and physical training, and before he knew it, Saturday had already arrived.</p>\n<p>He tried and failed to focus on homework for most of the day, managing to finish up only <em>some</em> of what he\u2019d actually wanted to get done.</p>\n<p>Most of his day was spent pacing back and forth in his room, glaring at the clock as it steadily ticked closer and closer to six.</p>\n<p>Why had he agreed to this. What a fucking horrible idea.</p>\n<p>He didn\u2019t know the first thing about dating. Sure, he\u2019d seen plenty of it around him growing up, so he knew how it was supposed to work\u2014in theory, anyway, because he\u2019d never actually <em>done it</em>. Bakugou had fooled around with a few people before, but keeping anyone around for longer than a few days just seemed like too much work.</p>\n<p>What if he fucked up and made Todoroki uncomfortable? What if he did something stupid in front of a reporter? Hell, what the fuck was he supposed to <em>wear</em>?</p>\n<p>Bakugou hated a lot of things, but right now it felt like he hated virtually everything ever. This was a fucking nightmare.</p>\n<p>By five minutes till 6PM, Bakugou was a ball of angry nerves and no closer to knowing what the hell he was supposed to do. He stomped over to his closet in frustration, pulling on a nicely fitted shirt rather than the loose-fitting monstrosities he sometimes wore. It was black, but most of his clothing was, so he supposed that couldn\u2019t be helped.</p>\n<p>He glanced at himself in the mirror, turning slightly. His pants were baggy but hung low on his hips, clinging to the swell of his ass just right. The shirt showed off his arms, his abs just barely visible when he turned a certain way and the fabric pulled a little tighter as a result.</p>\n<p>Well. <em>He\u2019d</em> fuck himself, so he couldn\u2019t look <em>that</em> bad, he guessed.</p>\n<p>He stuffed his hands in his pockets, storming down the stairs rapidly before he had any more time to dwell on what he was about to do.</p>\n<p>Bakugou Katsuki was the best. Bakugou Katsuki was <em>amazing</em>. There was no way he\u2019d be bad at dating anyway, so worrying was clearly a waste of his time.</p>\n<p>He came to a stop at the bottom of the stairs, looking out the windows to the front lawn to find Todoroki already standing near the entrance, his hands in his pockets as he gazed up at the passing clouds, a slight flush to his face. He was dressed slightly nicer than usual in a light blue button-up shirt, which was rolled up to his elbows, and had on a pair of brown cargo shorts that fit him too well to be accidental.</p>\n<p>Bakugou realized he was still frozen in place, staring. He shook his head, forcing himself back into motion.</p>\n<p>When he stepped outside, Todoroki turned to look at him, eyes widening as they looked Bakugou over.</p>\n<p>Bakugou glared. \u201cWhat? Got a problem?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNot\u2014not at all,\u201d Todoroki replied, eyes locked on Bakugou\u2019s arms for some reason. \u201cYou look\u2026 good. Very good, actually.\u201d</p>\n<p>The light was playing off of Todoroki\u2019s eyes in a way that made them seem like they were glowing, and Bakugou wanted to argue that he wasn\u2019t the only one looking unfairly attractive just then.</p>\n<p>But he didn\u2019t. That might seem like flirting. Which he wasn\u2019t doing.</p>\n<p>Because they weren\u2019t actually dating. They were just supposed to <em>look</em> like they were.</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course I look good,\u201d Bakugou said instead, turning away. \u201c<em>Obviously</em>. You look\u2026 decent, I guess.\u201d</p>\n<p>He glanced at Todoroki just in time to see him roll his eyes. \u201cThat\u2019s high praise coming from you, I suppose.\u201d</p>\n<p>They managed to catch one another\u2019s eye on accident, both breaking into an awkward flush.</p>\n<p>Jesus christ this was going to be difficult.</p>\n<p>\u201cAlright, fuck this. I\u2019m not having this awkward crap all damn night, I can\u2019t fucking deal,\u201d he growled, stomping up to Todoroki and abruptly clasping his hand in his own.</p>\n<p>Todoroki made a sound that Bakugou would have called a startled gasp it had come from anyone else.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhere the fuck are we going?\u201d Bakugou asked without preamble. \u201cI\u2019m hungry.\u201d</p>\n<p>Todoroki seemed stunned, but still managed to reply. \u201cI was planning on going to the coffee shop a few blocks over.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFan-fucking-tastic,\u201d Bakugou responded before pulling Todoroki along down the street in that direction. \u201cYou\u2019re paying.\u201d</p>\n<p>Todoroki didn\u2019t even stumble, damn him, keeping up easily, though he did sigh. \u201cI had a feeling you might say something like that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, well, you know me,\u201d Bakugou said. \u201cAlways thoughtful and shit.\u201d</p>\n<p>Todoroki didn\u2019t reply, but Bakugou saw him smile out of the corner of his eye as he entwined his fingers between Bakugou\u2019s own, following him down the road without further comment.</p>\n<p>And if Bakugou wordlessly paid for their food and drinks when they arrived at the coffee shop, Todoroki was wise enough not to say anything about it.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>They spent a couple of hours sitting in the coffee shop. This was the part Bakugou had figured would be most difficult, given that he and Todoroki had never really been great at conversation, but he was surprised to find that Todoroki was shockingly easy to talk to.</p>\n<p>Bakugou had assumed they had nothing in common. He had assumed completely wrong, apparently.</p>\n<p>\u201cAlright, I\u2019m not gonna argue with you that they\u2019re a good band,\u201d Bakugou was saying, \u201cBut I <em>am </em>going to say that they\u2019re definitely not the fucking best, alright.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHave you even listened to them, Bakugou?\u201d Todoroki asked, resting his chin in the palm of his hand as he gazed at Bakugou.</p>\n<p>Bakugou opened his mouth before closing it again briefly. \u201cThat\u2019s entirely beside the point. Nothing is better than Metallica. Absolutely nothing.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThey\u2019re a symphonic metal band. They made their break into the industry by playing <em>Metallica</em> cover songs. I am fairly certain you\u2019d love them.\u201d When Bakugou made to argue, Todoroki waved him off. \u201cYou know what? I\u2019ll just lend you my CDs. You can tell me they\u2019re not the best <em>after</em> you\u2019ve actually heard what they can do.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat the fuck ever, man,\u201d Bakugou mumbled, leaning back and crossing his arms over his chest as he attempted to fight off the flush threatening to rise on his cheeks. For some reason, Todoroki letting Bakugou borrow something that was obviously so important to him made him feel\u2014 well, it made him feel something. He wasn\u2019t sure what, exactly. But it definitely made him uncomfortable.</p>\n<p>He glanced out the window, blinking in surprise when he saw a camera pointed directly at them. \u201cUh,\u201d he said eloquently.</p>\n<p>Todoroki turned to look, eyebrows raising. \u201cOh. Looks like they\u2019ve noticed.\u201d</p>\n<p>There was a sudden tension between them that hadn\u2019t been there before. This was the part they were supposed to play up, wasn\u2019t it? And weren\u2019t they meant to seem like they\u2019d been maybe dating for a while now anyway?</p>\n<p>\u201cGive me your hand,\u201d Bakugou said, stretching his arm across the table.</p>\n<p>Todoroki looked quietly stunned but complied without comment, reaching his hand out to Bakugou slowly, as if afraid of startling a wild animal. Bakugou grasped it firmly in his own, entwining their fingers. Without thinking, he moved his feet forward under the table, pressing his legs against Todoroki\u2019s own.</p>\n<p>He wasn\u2019t sure the cameras could see that. He also wasn\u2019t sure they <em>couldn\u2019t,</em> either, he reasoned.</p>\n<p>\u201cLook at me like you like me or something,\u201d Bakugou mumbled, staring at Todoroki.</p>\n<p>Todoroki\u2019s mouth quirked up in amusement, though the tension in his eyes belied the fact that he was actually somewhat nervous. \u201cThat might be easier to do if you weren\u2019t glaring at me like you were hoping I\u2019d catch fire.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShut the fuck up,\u201d Bakugou said, his scowl deepening.</p>\n<p>\u201cI <em>can</em> catch on fire if you want, you know,\u201d Todoroki offered, eyes dancing.</p>\n<p><em>He\u2019s flirting with me</em>, Bakugou realized suddenly. Was that part of this act? Surely the reporters couldn\u2019t hear what they were talking about. Todoroki had no real reason to flirt with him.</p>\n<p>Unless he was trying to rile him up, perhaps. But two could play at that game.</p>\n<p>\u201cPretty sure I could <em>make </em>you catch fire if I really wanted to,\u201d Bakugou replied, voice low as he rubbed his thumb over the skin of Todoroki\u2019s wrist.</p>\n<p>Todoroki\u2019s eyes widened, his face reddening, mouth opening slightly in shock.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh?\u201d Todoroki asked, swallowing. \u201cHow so?\u201d</p>\n<p>Bakugou wasn\u2019t sure what was going on anymore. He also wasn\u2019t willing to back down, either.</p>\n<p>He raised his eyebrows, pulling Todoroki\u2019s hand slowly towards him and giving Todoroki plenty of time to stop him if he wanted.</p>\n<p>He didn\u2019t.</p>\n<p>Bakugou brough their entwined hands close to his face, tilting his head slightly before turning to press his lips to Todoroki\u2019s pulse. He made sure not to break eye contact, opening his mouth slightly to graze his teeth briefly along the skin of Todoroki\u2019s inner wrist before darting out his tongue to taste him.</p>\n<p>He heard Todoroki give a sharp intake of breath, his eyes wide and dark as they tracked the movement of Bakugou\u2019s mouth, seemingly unable to look away. His hand squeezed Bakugou\u2019s impulsively, his expression looking slightly lost and more than a little turned on.</p>\n<p>\u201cLike that,\u201d Bakugou murmured quietly, lowering their hands back to the table.</p>\n<p>Fuck.</p>\n<p>What the fuck. What the fuck did he just do.</p>\n<p>Shit. <em>Shit.</em></p>\n<p>This almost certainly qualified as taking things too fucking far or making Todoroki uncomfortable.</p>\n<p>And yet Todoroki was looking at him with that fucking <em>look</em> again, like he couldn\u2019t believe Bakugou was real. Only this time there was a flush riding high on his cheeks, his mouth hanging open, eyes hungry.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat was\u2014\u201c Todoroki started, breaking off when his voice cracked.</p>\n<p>Bakugou swallowed, looking back out the window. \u201cYeah, well. You asked. I was just proving a point. Doesn\u2019t mean anything.\u201d</p>\n<p>But that was a lie, and Bakugou knew it, because that had <em>definitely </em>meant something. At least to him.</p>\n<p>Todoroki\u2019s hand went slack in his own at the words, Bakugou\u2019s eyes snapping up to his face to find him looking out the window with an odd expression. \u201cAh. Right,\u201d was all he said.</p>\n<p>A silence hung in the air between them. Bakugou watched the reporter across the street with detachment, his stomach churning.</p>\n<p>He felt like he\u2019d fucked up and now he wasn\u2019t sure how to fix it.</p>\n<p>\u201cI wanted to talk to you about something,\u201d Bakugou said, mostly to break the quiet, which now felt suffocating. \u201cThe fuck are we supposed to tell the people we know about this?\u201d he asked, gesturing at the two of them.</p>\n<p>Todoroki gave him a cautious look, his eyes still seeming distant. Bakugou hated it. \u201cWhat would you like to tell them?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m asking <em>you, </em>asshole.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd I\u2019m wondering about your own opinion.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t <em>have</em> an opinion, ok? I\u2019ll do whatever you want,\u201d Bakugou hissed, throwing his free hand up in the air. \u201cThis is all for you anyway. I don\u2019t give a shit.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFine,\u201d Todoroki said, sounding mildly annoyed. \u201cWe\u2019ll tell everyone we\u2019re dating for real, then.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Fine</em>,\u201d Bakugou agreed, face reddening when he realized what he\u2019d just agreed to.</p>\n<p>That meant telling Kirishima and Kaminari that he was dating this idiot. And probably Ashido and Sero, too. Not to mention Ochako, who couldn\u2019t keep her nose out of anything he did most of the time.</p>\n<p>Fuck.</p>\n<p>What really bothered him was not the fact that he\u2019d have to talk about his feelings, though he definitely hated that part too. But the thing that didn\u2019t sit well with him was knowing he\u2019d be lying when he did it.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe should probably head back soon,\u201d Todoroki noted, draining the last of his drink. He let Bakugou\u2019s hand go as he stood up. Bakugou felt weirdly bereft, but stood to join him.</p>\n<p>They didn\u2019t hold hands the rest of the way back. For some weird reason, Bakugou had to stop himself from reaching out to grasp at Todoroki\u2019s hand repeatedly during the walk home.</p>\n<p>What the fuck was wrong with him?</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The next morning, he woke up to pounding on his dorm door. Which was a bad fucking move for whoever was on the other side, because if there was one thing most people knew, it was that you did <em>not </em>wake Bakugou up suddenly with loud noises.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat the FUCK do you want?\u201d he yelled, slamming his open palm against the wall and letting off an explosion with a resounding <em>boom</em>.</p>\n<p>The pounding stopped briefly. \u201cI <em>told </em>you he was still asleep<em>,</em> he\u2019s gonna be so pissed, man.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t care,\u201d came another voice just before the pounding resumed.</p>\n<p>\u201cFor fucks sake,\u201d Bakugou hissed, throwing the blankets off of himself as he stormed across the room to whip the door open with a flourish.</p>\n<p>Kaminari\u2019s fist was still raised as if to hit the door again, Kirishima hovering nervously behind him but looking determined.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat do you fucks want that couldn\u2019t possibly wait, hah?\u201d Bakugou growled.</p>\n<p>Kaminari thrust his cellphone in Bakugou\u2019s face accusingly. \u201cWhat the hell is this, dude?\u201d</p>\n<p>Bakugou snatched the offending object from his hands, peering at the screen.</p>\n<p>\n<em><u>Love Alive And Well at U.A.?<br>\n</u>Heroes in Training Todoroki Shouto and Bakugou Katsuki spotted on a romantic evening out!</em>\n</p>\n<p>Beneath the headline of the article were several pictures of him and Todoroki sitting at the caf\u00e9 together. In one, Bakugou appeared to be almost smiling, and in another Todoroki was gazing at Bakugou was a soft and obviously very fond expression.</p>\n<p>The final photo was like a punch to the gut, the picture showing him kissing Todoroki\u2019s wrist, their eyes locked. Just the sight of the picture was enough to make Bakugou\u2019s mouth dry, a spike of desire shooting through him.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo?\u201d Bakugou finally said, looking up from the pictures to find Kaminari and Kirishima both giving him questioning looks. \u201cWhat\u2019s the problem?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you fucking dating Todoroki?\u201d Kaminari accused.</p>\n<p>Bakugou handed his phone back to him\u2014without breaking it even slightly, which was new. \u201cYeah. I am,\u201d he answered, surprised at how easy it was to say aloud.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd you didn\u2019t <em>tell us</em>?\u201d Kirishima pressed, sounding hurt.</p>\n<p>Oh.</p>\n<p>\u201cLook, remember the other day when I told you I had something serious I couldn\u2019t talk to you about just yet?\u201d he said, sighing.</p>\n<p>Both of their eye widened in recognition.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah. So, there you go. We\u2019re fucking dating. Or whatever,\u201d Bakugou finished anticlimactically.</p>\n<p>\u201cDude,\u201d Kaminari sighed. \u201cThank god.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, I am <em>so </em>happy this finally happened,\u201d Kirishima gushed. \u201cCongratulations, man. That\u2019s awesome.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWait, finally?\u201d Bakugou asked, eyebrows drawing down in confusion.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, obviously,\u201d Kaminari replied, sharing a look with Kirishima. \u201cI mean Todoroki\u2019s been so obvious about being into you for like, at least a good year now, man. It wasn\u2019t exactly a secret. And you\u2019ve always been sort of weirdly fixated on him. We figured it was just a matter of time before you two worked things out.\u201d</p>\n<p>Bakugou gaped at them both, unable to speak.</p>\n<p>\u201cPlus now this means we can go on double dates and stuff!\u201d Kirishima cheered excitedly. \u201cIt\u2019ll be great, I can\u2019t wait.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhaaat,\u201d Kaminari groaned. \u201cI don\u2019t want to go anywhere with them. Didn\u2019t you see how mushy they were in those pictures? I\u2019ll puke, man. I can\u2019t handle that.\u201d</p>\n<p>Bakugou heard Kirishima laugh, saying something in response, but it all sounded like it was coming from far away. He couldn\u2019t get past the words <em>he\u2019s been so obvious about being into you for like at least a year now</em>. They just kept ringing in his head, over and over, his heart feeling like it was about to jump straight out of his chest.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s too early for this shit,\u201d he said suddenly. \u201cDon\u2019t bother trying to wake me up again. I won\u2019t answer.\u201d</p>\n<p>He then slammed the door in their faces, hearing Kirishima whine before Kaminari said something to him in response and they both walked off laughing.</p>\n<p>What the fuck was going on?</p>\n<p>Todoroki wasn\u2019t into him. Not like <em>really</em> into him, not for real. He couldn\u2019t be. It didn\u2019t make any fucking <em>sense</em>.</p>\n<p>\u201cDating people is horrible,\u201d he said aloud to himself. But despite that there was no one there to tell him that he was full of shit, he still knew he wasn\u2019t exactly upset by what was going on.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>A few hours later, as he laid in bed moping about how much he hated everything and everyone \u2013a typical day, really\u2014his phone suddenly vibrated with an incoming text.</p>\n<p><strong>[Half \u2018n Half]: </strong>We made the news.</p>\n<p><strong>[Explodo-King]: </strong>i fucking heard, dumbass. congrats.</p>\n<p><strong>[Half \u2018n Half]:</strong> Are you mad?</p>\n<p><strong>[Explodo-King]: </strong>no?</p>\n<p><strong>[Half \u2018n Half]: </strong>Did you see the pictures?</p>\n<p>Bakugou had seen the fucking pictures. He\u2019d spent the last few hours gazing at them on and off after saving them all to his phone for reason he couldn\u2019t explain. Todoroki didn\u2019t need to know that, though.</p>\n<p><strong>[Explodo-King]: </strong>yah i saw. not bad.</p>\n<p><strong>[Half \u2018n Half]: </strong>I liked the last one best.</p>\n<p>Bakugou swallowed, burying his face into his pillow for a moment before attempting to respond. This felt strangely like flirting again.</p>\n<p><strong>[Explodo-King]: </strong>who wouldn\u2019t. it looked hot.</p>\n<p><strong>[Half \u2018n Half]: </strong>That\u2019s a good way of describing it.</p>\n<p>Bakugou\u2019s face flushed. What the fuck did he want from him? Christ.</p>\n<p><strong>[Explodo-King]: </strong>i\u2019m new to dating, ok, not sex. ffs give me some credit here.</p>\n<p>There was no immediate reply to this, and for a while Bakugou began to wonder if he\u2019d perhaps said the wrong thing. But a few minutes later, he finally got a response.</p>\n<p><strong>[Half \u2018n Half]: </strong>I think we should go on another date. Maybe a few, if you\u2019re willing. I want to keep the publicity going.</p>\n<p>That\u2026 did sound reasonable. One date probably wasn\u2019t enough to put enough pressure on Endeavor to leave Todoroki alone. He supposed he could suffer through a few more.</p>\n<p><strong>[Explodo-King]: </strong>fuck. fine, i guess. when and where?</p>\n<p><strong>[Half \u2018n Half]: </strong>Is Wednesday night too soon?</p>\n<p><strong>[Explodo-King]: </strong>it\u2019s fine, idc.</p>\n<p><strong>[Half \u2018n Half]: </strong>Good. We\u2019re going to dinner and a movie this time.</p>\n<p>Bakugou immediately imagined sitting in the dark with Todoroki for several hours. He also immediately began to fidget, the mental image almost too much.</p>\n<p><strong>[Explodo-King]: </strong>whatever. just tell me what time and i\u2019ll meet u out front again.</p>\n<p><strong>[Half \u2018n Half]:</strong> 5:30PM. Don\u2019t be late.</p>\n<p><strong>[Explodo-King]: </strong>fuck u, as if i would be.</p>\n<p>Bakugou threw his phone across his bed, listening to it land with a thump near his feet. So they had another date. Alright, fine. And so what if this one was a little more intimate that the last? Bakugou could handle it. Bakugou could handle <em>anything</em>, goddammit.</p>\n<p>The butterflies swarming in his stomach said otherwise, but really? Fuck them.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The next day, as he was walking back from class, his phone starting ringing in his pocket.</p>\n<p>Why the fuck was everyone determined to bother him all the time now?</p>\n<p>He sighed, pulling it out and blanching when he saw it was his mother. He had a sense of foreboding as he pressed the button to take the call, bracing himself for the worst.</p>\n<p>\u201cBAKUGOU KATSUKI, YOU LITTLE SHIT,\u201d his mother screamed into the phone. He winced, holding it away from his ear slightly.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe fuck do you want, hag?\u201d he yelled back.</p>\n<p>\u201cHow <em>dare </em>you, you ungrateful brat.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHow dare I <em>what</em>?\u201d Bakugou growled, fearing the worst.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou have a goddamn boyfriend and you didn\u2019t even bother to tell your own mother before she read about it in the paper? I can\u2019t believe you. My own neighbors know more about your love life than I do, for gods sake.\u201d</p>\n<p>Oh. That\u2026 had not actually occurred to Bakugou. \u201cLooks, it\u2019s kind of a recent development, alright? I just didn\u2019t think about it. I\u2019m not, like. Leaving you out or whatever, so just chill the fuck out.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI will chill the fuck out precisely when you tell me everything I want to know about you and this boy,\u201d she answered, clearly on a mission.</p>\n<p>Could he literally <em>never </em>catch a break? Jesus.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Fine</em>,\u201d he hissed into the phone, stomping his way across campus. \u201cWhat do you want to know?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cEverything, damn you. You\u2019d better start talking or I\u2019ll come down there myself and wring it out of you.\u201d</p>\n<p>He knew better than to think that was an empty threat.</p>\n<p>He spent the next several minutes rambling on to her about Todoroki as a result.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe sounds perfect for you,\u201d she told him once he was done.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s an asshole and he\u2019s confusing and his hair is <em>distracting</em>, mom.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI <em>said</em> he was perfect, didn\u2019t I?\u201d Bakugou could practically hear her grin.</p>\n<p>\u201cUgh, fucking\u2014whatever,\u201d he mumbled, wiping a hand across his face. \u201cCan I go now? I have to study.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019d better be studying, dammit. Just because you\u2019re in love now doesn\u2019t mean you can let your grades drop, got it?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShut the fuck up,\u201d he hissed. He\u2019d never said anything about <em>love</em>, not even once. What the fuck.</p>\n<p>She had the audacity to laugh, damn her. \u201cAlright. Well good luck on your date, kiddo. I love you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, yeah. Love you too. Bye,\u201d he replied, abruptly ending the call.</p>\n<p>Some part of Bakugou felt weirdly grateful that she\u2019d called, even though he\u2019d never tell her so. It was nice to know your parents had your back.</p>\n<p>The thought made something in Bakugou\u2019s chest hurt, like he\u2019d just been stabbed with a needle, when he thought about how Todoroki must feel.</p>\n<p>Fuck Endeavor. He was lucky to have a son like Todoroki in the first place. The fact that he was hung up on something so fucking stupid was nothing short of infuriating.</p>\n<p>Bakugou had a brief mental image of Todoroki the day he\u2019d found them in the foyer, flinching back from his father\u2019s tone. Something in him turned from molten rage to cold hard steel.</p>\n<p>He\u2019d make damn sure Endeavor never made Todoroki feel like that ever again.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wednesday arrived too soon in Bakugou\u2019s opinion. By the time they were done with class, Bakugou barely had enough time to run back to his dorm to get ready. He showered as fast as he possibly could, throwing on one of his usual t-shirts but opting for a pair of tight-fitting dark jeans this time around.</p>\n<p>The combination of the skull on his shirt, the tight pants, and the combat boots he threw over them gave him a distinctly bad-boy look, he noted with no small amount of pride, gazing at himself in the mirror.</p>\n<p>Did it pass the test?</p>\n<p>\u201cYep. I\u2019d fuck myself,\u201d he said aloud in confirmation that yes, it did indeed pass the test. \u00a0He turned to march out the door and down the hall.</p>\n<p>Todoroki was once again waiting for him outside, and like before, Bakugou paused to give him a thorough once-over before Todoroki could notice he was there. He was dressed similarly to Bakugou, jeans hugging his long legs as he cocked a hip, leaning against the wall of the dorm hall. His shirt was dark this time, and he looked all the better for it in Bakugou\u2019s opinion. Not to mention that it was a very tight-fitting shirt.</p>\n<p>Bakugou swallowed.</p>\n<p>Whatever. It didn\u2019t really matter <em>what</em> he was wearing, he supposed. He was just worried about how it would look for the cameras. That was all.</p>\n<p>\u201cYo,\u201d Bakugou greeted flatly as he stepped outside, enjoying the way Todoroki\u2019s eyes raked over him quickly and not missing the way they lingered over his legs. \u201cAre we eating first or watching a movie?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDinner first,\u201d Todoroki responded, pushing off the building to walk up to Bakugou. He noticed that Todoroki didn\u2019t bother to ask if that was ok with him this time, and somehow Bakugou felt like that was some kind of progress.</p>\n<p>\u201cGood. I\u2019m fucking hungry,\u201d Bakugou answered, falling into step seamlessly beside him and reaching out to clasp their hands together. Todoroki linked their fingers wordlessly, seeming much more at ease this time around, mumbling something under his breath about Bakugou always being hungry, which he kindly chose to ignore. \u201cWhere are we eating?\u201d he asked instead.</p>\n<p>He got an amused look in response. \u201cI was thinking that Chinese food place you like so much. It\u2019s fairly close to the theater anyway.\u201d</p>\n<p>Bakugou\u2019s mouth fell open. How did Todoroki know his favorite place to eat?</p>\n<p>But when he thought about it, he realized he was also aware of the fact that Todoroki\u2019s favorite place to go for food was a particular ramen bar a few blocks away because they served cold soba noodles there.</p>\n<p>How in the <em>fuck</em> did he know that? Or more importantly, <em>why</em>? Todoroki\u2019s likes and dislikes had never been something that Bakugou had cared enough about to pay attention to.</p>\n<p>Except that he apparently had, because he suddenly realized he knew a lot of them.</p>\n<p>\u201cAlright. But only if we can go to the ramen shop next time,\u201d Bakugou agreed, just to see Todoroki\u2019s eyes widen in surprise, that fucking <em>look</em> on his face again and <em>dammit</em> Bakugou wasn\u2019t sure if he liked that or not honestly. He couldn\u2019t figure out what it meant.</p>\n<p>There was a soft squeeze of his hand before Todoroki managed to reply. \u201cI think I can agree to that.\u201d</p>\n<p>Once they reached the Chinese restaurant, they spent most of their time talking again. It came even easier this time, Bakugou finding himself almost teasing Todoroki rather than antagonizing him on multiple occasions. Todoroki refused to tell him what movie they were seeing once they finished eating, on the grounds that it was \u201ca surprise,\u201d but Bakugou was convinced Todoroki was mostly doing it just to piss him off.</p>\n<p>As they were leaving the restaurant, Bakugou noticed a camera pointed at them from across the road. He wrapped one arm around Todoroki\u2019s shoulders, pulling him in close. That seemed like the sort of thing two people who were dating might do.</p>\n<p>Right? He thought so, anyway.</p>\n<p>Todoroki turned to give him a surprised look. Bakugou gestured at the reporter slightly with a tilt of his head.</p>\n<p>\u201cAh. I see we\u2019ve been noticed again,\u201d Todoroki murmured.</p>\n<p>Bakugou snorted. \u201cThat\u2019s the plan, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p>\n<p>He felt a pressure on his waist and looked down, Todoroki\u2019s hand resting gentle but firm on his hip, his arm wrapped around his lower back comfortably as they continued to walk leisurely toward the theater.</p>\n<p>It was\u2026 nice. Bakugou wasn\u2019t used to this kind of casual affection\u2014other than the stuff he sometimes got from Kirishima, who was too touchy-feely for Bakugou\u2019s sanity sometimes. This was different, though. Warm and casual, yet with something deeper attached to it. The feel of their arms wrapped around one another like this was a different kind of intimate than holding hands. Protective, almost. Or maybe possessive was a better word.</p>\n<p>Regardless, Bakugou found he was reluctant to drop his arm from Todoroki\u2019s shoulders once they reached the theater, but he did when Todoroki let his hand fall from his waist as he purchased two tickets for them without even bothering to ask Bakugou. Bakugou wasn\u2019t exactly keen on stopping him, either, to be fair.</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you want to get anything to eat or drink?\u201d Todoroki asked him once they\u2019d made their way past the ticket booth.</p>\n<p>Bakugou shot him an incredulous look. \u201cWe just fucking ate.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo harm in checking,\u201d Todoroki muttered under his breath, stalking off past Bakugou towards Theater Six, where their movie was apparently playing. Bakugou hadn\u2019t caught the name when Todoroki was buying the tickets, and Todoroki still refused to tell him \u2013\u201cIt was on your ticket, didn\u2019t you look before you handed it over?\u201d\u2014but had assured him that it wasn\u2019t a romantic comedy at least.</p>\n<p>Bakugou didn\u2019t necessarily <em>hate </em>that sort of movie, exactly. He just wasn\u2019t sure he could handle any more romance than he already was at the moment.</p>\n<p>They passed through the doors into the dim room, Bakugou taking in the screen and the fact that not many people were in the theater with them. Must be a movie that had been out for a while already, then. Todoroki seemed intent on where he was going, so Bakugou followed him without complaint towards the back of the theater, even though he usually preferred sitting right up front. He was feeling unusually charitable, though, deciding not to bother arguing.</p>\n<p>He was also feeling a sudden bout of extreme nerves for some fucking reason. That could have been part of his silence, too.</p>\n<p>Bakugou had been to the movies plenty of times. In fact it was pretty common for Kaminari and Kirishima to drag their group of friends out to see <em>something</em> at least once a month. The experience was always loud and full of laughter, Ashido throwing popcorn at something Sero had said while Kirishima laughed obnoxiously at some lame comment Kaminari had made, everyone taking turns shouting commentary out at the screen when something particularly noteworthy happened. They\u2019d been nearly kicked out on more than one occasion. On more than several, honestly.</p>\n<p>This was different, though, Bakugou noted uncomfortably as he sat down beside Todoroki in the back row. Everything was too quiet, and the familiar chatter that always accompanied an outing with his so-called friends was completely absent\u2014and strangely missed.</p>\n<p>Bakugou kicked his feet up on the seat in front of him, resting his elbows on the arm rests and stretching out. He wasn\u2019t really sure what to do with himself otherwise.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t seen this yet, have you?\u201d Todoroki asked quietly as they waited for the show to begin.</p>\n<p>Bakugou shot him a look. \u201cI don\u2019t know, since <em>some</em> <em>asshole</em> still won\u2019t tell me what the fuck we\u2019re even seeing.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you telling me you can\u2019t figure it out for yourself?\u201d Todoroki asked, voice kind, but there was a glint in his eye that told Bakugou he was being mocked.</p>\n<p>\u201cI will fucking punch you. I swear to god,\u201d he warned, upset with himself for knowing he didn\u2019t actually mean it. He must be going soft. What the fuck.</p>\n<p>Todoroki gave him a soft smile, like he knew Bakugou didn\u2019t mean it either. Damn him.</p>\n<p>The lights suddenly dimmed completely, a hush falling over the room as the movie began to play.</p>\n<p>If you asked Bakugou what the movie was about, he wouldn\u2019t have been able to tell you, because an hour into the film he wasn\u2019t sure he could remember a single goddamn thing about it.</p>\n<p>His mind was completely elsewhere, hyper-fixated on the man sitting beside him.</p>\n<p>He couldn\u2019t stop thinking about how close Todoroki\u2019s hand was resting to his own, or how their shoulders touched in a barely-there brush of fabric if he breathed in too deeply; how dark it was in the room and how they were completely alone and they were both sitting so, so close to one another and yet it might as well be miles away.</p>\n<p>Bakugou didn\u2019t know what he wanted, but he had a suspicion it was more than he should be wanting regardless.</p>\n<p><em>You don\u2019t have fucking <strong>feelings</strong> for Todoroki Shouto</em>, he told himself internally as he watched Todoroki\u2019s eyes reflect the light of the movie on the screen, face awash in shadows and swirls of color.</p>\n<p><em>You don\u2019t have any <strong>right</strong> to want more than you already have</em>, he told himself when Todoroki gave a quiet laugh at something in the film, Bakugou\u2019s hand twitching reflexively as he suppressed the urge to take his hand in his own.</p>\n<p><em>There aren\u2019t even any cameras around, you can\u2019t get away with passing it off as part of some fucking plan</em>, he berated himself, hating everything but especially hating himself for wanting to lean in and press his lips against Todoroki\u2019s skin.</p>\n<p>Bakugou blinked slowly, an idea occurring to him.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey,\u201d he said, leaning closer to Todoroki. \u201cJust how far are we going to take this, anyway?\u201d</p>\n<p>He felt Todoroki turn to look at him but kept his own eyes forward, unable to look at him just then, <em>knowing </em>what he was about to do and feeling guilty for it already.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Todoroki whispered back, confused.</p>\n<p>\u201cI <em>mean</em>, how much PDA do you want to do for the cameras?\u201d Bakugou asked nonchalantly, as if this were nothing at all. \u201cAre we gonna kiss in front of them, or what?\u201d</p>\n<p>The silence that stretched out after this question was long enough that Bakugou began to worry, and made the mistake of actually turning to glance at Todoroki as a result.</p>\n<p>Todoroki was looking at him with wide eyes, his expression unreadable. \u201cI suppose that would probably be wise,\u201d he said slowly. \u201cIt would leave no question as to the nature of our relationship, if we did.\u201d</p>\n<p>Bakugou nodded, as if that was exactly what he\u2019d been thinking all along. \u201cAlright. Whatever. But have you ever actually kissed anyone before?\u201d</p>\n<p>Todoroki\u2019s eyes widened further. Bakugou couldn\u2019t look away, watching his irises shift and dilate in the dark of the room. \u201cOnce or twice,\u201d Todoroki murmured. \u201cBut nothing very serious, if that\u2019s what you\u2019re asking.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m asking if you\u2019d feel fucking confident kissing in front of a camera, idiot,\u201d Bakugou mumbled.</p>\n<p>It looked like Todoroki was warring with himself internally over how honest to be. \u201cThen no,\u201d he replied. \u201cProbably not.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI fucking figured,\u201d Bakugou replied, though his voice lacked bite. In fact he sounded slightly nervous. \u201cIf you want to practice before giving it a go for all the world to see, now is probably as good a time as any.\u201d</p>\n<p>Todoroki froze. It sounded like he wasn\u2019t breathing.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou don\u2019t fucking have to, obviously,\u201d Bakugou mumbled, finally looking away. \u201cJust throwing it out there or whatever so you don\u2019t fucking embarrass yourself later and then blame me for it.\u201d</p>\n<p>A few minutes passed in silence, wherein Bakugou stared blankly at the moving images before him while his heart raced like it was trying to win an Olympic fucking medal, his stomach clenched tight with nerves.</p>\n<p>He couldn\u2019t fucking believe he\u2019d just suggested that. God, of all the stupid, lame-ass things he could have possibly said\u2014</p>\n<p>\u201cYou really wouldn\u2019t mind?\u201d Todoroki asked, voice quiet, but Bakugou would have been able to pick out the words in a crowd of thousands.</p>\n<p>He turned his head cautiously, finding Todoroki leaning towards him and sitting even closer than they already had been. \u201cGuess not,\u201d he mumbled, when inside he felt like he was screaming.</p>\n<p>\u201cThen I\u2019d like to. Um,\u201d Todoroki started, seeming unsure of how to go about this. \u201cPractice, I mean.\u201d</p>\n<p>Right. Ok. Bakugou was definitely not panicking right now. He was also definitely not feeling like he\u2019d just won a prize greater than every medal or trophy he\u2019d received in his life.</p>\n<p>He clearly had more experience with this than Todoroki, so he figured it only made sense to try and take control of the situation. Probably.</p>\n<p>It didn\u2019t really matter because Bakugou would have done so regardless, but still.</p>\n<p>He nodded at Todoroki in response, gesturing for him to scoot back far enough that he could lift up the arm of the seat that was between them. Once he did so it felt like something shifted in the air, like a safety net he hadn\u2019t even known existed had been pulled away, because now there was nothing separating them at all.</p>\n<p><em>Todoroki Shouto wants you to kiss him</em>, his brain supplied completely uselessly, as if he\u2019d fucking forgotten.</p>\n<p>He still somehow couldn\u2019t believe it, though.</p>\n<p>\u201cCome here,\u201d Bakugou murmured, turning to face him and scooting slightly closer. Todoroki did as he asked, shifting nearer hesitantly, seeming unsure of himself\u2014which was so fucking unusual that Bakugou almost couldn\u2019t believe what he was seeing.</p>\n<p>He rested a hand on Todoroki\u2019s shoulder gently, watching the way Todoroki\u2019s eyes widened infinitesimally at the contact. He took one of Todoroki\u2019s free hands with his own, bringing it up and resting it along the juncture of his collar bone.</p>\n<p>They both stared at each other, getting used to the feeling of their hands on one another.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis ok?\u201d Bakugou asked, because he wasn\u2019t about to force himself on anyone no matter how much he wanted this.</p>\n<p>And he did want this. Desperately, he realized.</p>\n<p>Todoroki nodded, still looking disbelieving.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna kiss you now then, alright?\u201d Bakugou clarified, watching a flush work its way up to settle high on Todoroki\u2019s face. \u201cIf you don\u2019t like it or if you want me to stop, tell me. \u201c</p>\n<p>He could see emotions lurking in Todoroki\u2019s eyes but the only one he was able to discern for certain was resolve. \u201cAlright,\u201d Todoroki whispered, tongue darting out to wet his lips.</p>\n<p>Bakugou tracked the movement with his eyes, captivated, unconsciously mirroring the action.</p>\n<p>And then he leaned forward, letting his eyes drop closed as he touched his mouth to Todoroki\u2019s own.</p>\n<p>The kiss was soft, gentle and searching, full of nerves as they both tried to feel each other out. Todoroki pressed back against him, mouth moving ever so slightly but enough to be encouraging, so Bakugou pulled back just slightly before pressing in to do it again, his hand sliding up from Todoroki\u2019s shoulder and working its way around his neck to pull him in closer.</p>\n<p>Todoroki made a quiet noise at the touch, his mouth opening slightly as he did so. Bakugou didn\u2019t waste the opportunity, using his newfound grip to tilt Todoroki\u2019s head just so before pressing back in against him, open mouthed.</p>\n<p>Something changed immediately. Bakugou could feel it, the hairs rising on the back of his neck and arms with a sort of electricity that went straight to his head. Todoroki\u2019s own hand shifted to grasp more firmly at Bakugou, wandering high enough to run through the base of his hair as he gripped along the back of his neck firmly, moving them even closer together.</p>\n<p>Bakugou gasped, not knowing how Todoroki had managed to find one of his weaknesses but also not caring because it felt fucking amazing. He curled his free hand around Todoroki\u2019s hip in response, squeezing as he slid his lips along his with an impending loss of control.</p>\n<p>Without thinking, Bakugou slipped his tongue along Todoroki\u2019s open mouth, letting it glide wetly along his bottom lip before sucking it between his own and biting down gently.</p>\n<p>Todoroki moaned, the sound sending a spark of desire to his groin like a shock of lightning. The sound seemed to startling them both enough that they broke apart, gazing at one another wide-eyed, breathing labored.</p>\n<p>\u201cGood?\u201d Bakugou asked.</p>\n<p>\u201cGood,\u201d Todoroki agreed, voice rough.</p>\n<p>\u201cMore?\u201d Bakugou tried, testing his luck.</p>\n<p>\u201cPlease,\u201d Todoroki replied, hand fisting fully in Bakugou\u2019s hair.</p>\n<p>And then they weren\u2019t just kissing, they were making out, and Bakugou frankly wondered why they hadn\u2019t done this years ago.</p>\n<p>He pressed Todoroki backwards, lifting the arm of the seat behind him barely in time as he pushed Todoroki down across the seats. He figured Todoroki would be embarrassed, or at least shy about the move. He was shocked in the best possible way when instead Todoroki fisted his hands in the front of Bakugou\u2019s shirt, hauling him down bodily on top of him.</p>\n<p>Their mouths found each other again immediately, hands seeming to be everywhere all at once. Bakugou would never have guessed Todoroki to be inexperienced with kissing at all, because he was downright great at it. Bakugou honestly wasn\u2019t sure he\u2019d ever made out with <em>anyone</em> and had it feel this fucking good.</p>\n<p>He licked against Todoroki\u2019s open mouth, swallowing his gasp greedily, repeating the action. When Todoroki\u2019s own tongue suddenly slid tentatively against his own, Bakugou sucked in a sharp breath, groaning at the feeling of the wet glide and the heat of Todoroki\u2019s mouth.</p>\n<p>\u201cFuck,\u201d Bakugou hissed, breaking away just long enough to latch onto Todoroki\u2019s neck. \u201cYou\u2019re too good at this.\u201d</p>\n<p>Todoroki moaned in response, head dropping to the side to give Bakugou better access.</p>\n<p>Bakugou licked his way up the straining muscle, kissing and biting affection into every inch of skin he could reach. \u201cYou taste amazing,\u201d he murmured without thinking, meaning it, because Todoroki tasted like something Bakugou wasn\u2019t sure he\u2019d ever get enough of.</p>\n<p>Beneath him, Todoroki\u2019s arched, pressing up and into Bakugou, his arms wrapped firmly around his torso, hands fisted in the back of Bakugou\u2019s shirt. He seemed half out of his mind.</p>\n<p>Bakugou could relate.</p>\n<p>He bit down hard against the skin Todoroki\u2019s neck, sucking a mark into his flesh and almost shaking at the broken sound Todoroki made in response.</p>\n<p>Two hands were suddenly tangled in his hair, pulling his head back sharply. Bakugou broke away with a cry, face flushed, eyes wild.</p>\n<p>\u201cGet back here,\u201d Todoroki growled, the sound going straight to Bakugou\u2019s groin before he surged up, mouth sealing over Bakugou\u2019s possessively once more.</p>\n<p>They spent the rest of the entire movie making out, just barely managing to keep things from going any further than they already had. Bakugou wanted to, fuck, he <em>desperately </em>wanted to, but he wasn\u2019t sure if he\u2019d be able to forgive himself for doing so later.</p>\n<p>This was already taking way too much advantage of Todoroki as it was. Bakugou knew he was going to feel horrible about it later, but right then, he couldn\u2019t find it in him to care about anything beyond the feel of Todoroki against him.</p>\n<p>When the credits started rolling and the lights came back on, they finally managed to pull apart. Bakugou was frankly shocked that so much time had passed so quickly. He was also possibly <em>slightly</em> disappointed that his opportunity was now over.</p>\n<p>When he looked down at Todoroki to find his face flushed, hair wild, lips swollen and red, he wondered if maybe he\u2019d gone too far. He also knew he\u2019d do it all over again if given half the chance.</p>\n<p>He didn\u2019t know if that made him feel better about it, or worse.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe should go,\u201d he said, moving away from him and standing awkwardly, unable to look Todoroki in the eye anymore.</p>\n<p>He heard Todoroki shuffle around before standing up beside him as well.</p>\n<p>They both adjusted their clothes and hair into a more normal position, faces red and dazed as they walked out of the theater.</p>\n<p>By the time they made it out onto the street, they still hadn\u2019t said anything to one another. Bakugou wasn\u2019t sure if he was physically capable of doing so without saying something completely stupid like \u201chey can we maybe try that again forever?\u201d so he kept his mouth firmly shut.</p>\n<p>When they\u2019d turned the corner down the road, Bakugou noticed a reporter lurking around. Probably waiting for them, he realized, reaching out to take Todoroki\u2019s hand in his own without further thought.</p>\n<p>He did have a job to do, after all.</p>\n<p>Todoroki jolted, as if shocked by the touch. His eyes pinned Bakugou with a curious stare, Bakugou tilting his head towards the reporter wordlessly in reply.</p>\n<p>\u201cRight,\u201d he heard Todoroki murmur, more to himself than anyone else.</p>\n<p>Before he could think too much about it, Bakugou turned to face him, hand cradling the curve of his face as he pulled him down for a chaste kiss right there in front of everyone.</p>\n<p>Todoroki made a sound of surprise before pressing into the kiss. Bakugou felt his pulse pounding in his ears, but he was reluctant to let Todoroki go. He didn\u2019t know if he\u2019d ever get a chance to do this again.</p>\n<p>After a while though he finally did pull back, clearing his throat awkwardly. \u201cIf that\u2019s not front page tomorrow I\u2019ll eat my own fucking shoe.\u201d</p>\n<p>Todoroki blinked, looking stunned.</p>\n<p>The guilt over what had just happened between them seemed to hit Bakugou all at once, and he turned away, frowning. \u201cLook, I\u2019m sorry if I made you uncomfortable in the theater,\u201d he forced himself to say, not used to apologizing for\u2014well, anything, really. \u201cI probably took that too far. I won\u2019t do it again.\u201d</p>\n<p>Something in his chest hurt, sharp and painful as he spoke.</p>\n<p>He heard a disbelieving sound come from Todoroki but was too afraid to look at him to find out what it meant. \u201cYou\u2014you think <em>you</em> took it too far?\u201d</p>\n<p>Bakugou raised his eyes then, glancing at him sternly. \u201cDon\u2019t make me say it again, asshole.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not, I\u2019m just\u2014\u201c Todoroki broke off, clearly trying to gather his thoughts. \u201cI didn\u2019t think you did.\u201d</p>\n<p>Oh.</p>\n<p>Well, in that case.</p>\n<p>Uh.</p>\n<p>Bakugou had no fucking idea how to respond to that, actually.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe fuck does that mean?\u201d he managed to ask, feeling half afraid of the answer.</p>\n<p>Todoroki\u2019s hand squeezed his in response, as if grounding himself with the contact. \u201cI mean I didn\u2019t dislike it. So there\u2019s no need to apologize.\u201d</p>\n<p>What the fuck? He didn\u2019t dislike it?</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat, are you saying I can do it again, then?\u201d Bakugou blurted, regretting the words the moment they left his mouth.</p>\n<p>Todoroki\u2019s head snapped to look at him. \u201cI\u2026 wouldn\u2019t say no to more practice,\u201d he responded, voice careful.</p>\n<p>Ah. Right.</p>\n<p>Practice.</p>\n<p>Because they weren\u2019t actually dating.</p>\n<p>Some part of Bakugou had actually forgotten.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell if you ever feel like you need more fucking practice, you know where to find me,\u201d Bakugou said, trying and failing to not sound disappointed.</p>\n<p>He could see Todoroki frowning at him out of the corner of his eye, like he was fucking confused. Well, good then. Bakugou didn\u2019t give a shit.</p>\n<p>Neither of them said anything further for the rest of the walk home.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bakugou barely slept that night. He couldn\u2019t get Todoroki out of his fucking head. The feel of him writhing beneath him, the sound of his breath heavy in Bakugou\u2019s ear, the taste of him warm and wet against his tongue.</p>\n<p>It was three o\u2019clock in the fucking morning, and Bakugou Katsuki was having a crisis. He was feeling <em>feelings</em>. The kind he <em>wasn\u2019t supposed to fucking feel</em>.</p>\n<p>He knew he couldn\u2019t deny what he felt for Todoroki anymore. He just also knew he couldn\u2019t do anything about it at this point because he\u2019d agreed to be part of the smartest and yet stupidest plan of all time.</p>\n<p>Bakugou sighed, hating himself.</p>\n<p>He spent his night silently replaying their date over and over in his mind because there was nothing he could do to fucking stop it.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The next morning, Bakugou was walking to class when Ochako ran up beside him, sporting a grin that Bakugou knew from experience meant trouble.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe fuck do you want now,\u201d he sighed as she fell into step with him.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, not much. Just wanted to congratulate you on the new romance,\u201d she hummed, eyes gleaming with something Bakugou knew was going to give him a headache. \u201cAnd on the date last night, too. Looks like it must have gone reeeeeally well.\u201d</p>\n<p>Bakugou\u2019s brows drew together in a frown. \u201cWhat the fuck is that supposed to mean, angelface.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, I saw Todoroki on my way back from breakfast this morning,\u201d she replied, teeth gleaming in a way that wasn\u2019t necessarily nice. \u201cI noticed he had a <em>very</em> interesting mark on the side of his neck. I don\u2019t suppose you\u2019d know anything about that, would you?\u201d</p>\n<p>Bakugou was very familiar with explosions. And right now he was pretty certain he was about to explode with embarrassment.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Shut the fuck up</em>,\u201d he hissed, taking a swing at her. \u201cMind your own goddamn business!\u201d</p>\n<p>She dodged easily, laughing at him as she took off down the hall in the direction of class. \u201cMight want to be more careful about where you leave those next time, then!\u201d</p>\n<p>Fuck. <em>Fuck</em>. He was going to get shit from <em>everyone </em>about this all fucking day, he just <em>knew</em> it.</p>\n<p>He let out a frustrated yell, stomping off towards class with resignation.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Later that night, he got a text.</p>\n<p><strong>[Half \u2018n Half]:</strong> You marked me.</p>\n<p>Jesus fucking christ. As if he hadn\u2019t been hearing about this exact thing for <em>literal hours</em>.</p>\n<p><strong>[Explodo-King]: </strong>it wasn\u2019t on purpose. ffs no one will shut up about it.</p>\n<p><strong>[Half \u2018n Half]: </strong>I\u2019m not mad.</p>\n<p>Bakugou was suspicious of that. It seemed like the sort of thing <em>he </em>would have been mad about if it\u2019d been done to him. He watched, his phone showing Todoroki was typing again.</p>\n<p><strong>[Half \u2018n Half]: </strong>I was just wondering how you did it.</p>\n<p>Bakugou almost dropped his fucking phone.</p>\n<p>What the fuck was he supposed to say to <em>that</em>? Was this flirting? It felt suspiciously like flirting, but maybe he was just projecting.</p>\n<p><strong>[Explodo-King]:</strong> the fuck kind of question is that? idk how to explain it i just kno how to do it.</p>\n<p><strong>[Half \u2018n Half]: </strong>Then can you show me?</p>\n<p><strong>[Explodo-King]: </strong>are u asking for more practice?</p>\n<p><strong>[Half \u2018n Half]: </strong>I\u2019d like to learn, so yes.</p>\n<p>Well. Bakugou was a lot of things, but despite knowing how much this would probably hurt him in the long-run, he wasn\u2019t stupid enough to turn an offer like that down.</p>\n<p><strong>[Explodo-King]: </strong>fine. when and where?</p>\n<p><strong>[Half \u2018n Half]: </strong>Is tonight too soon?</p>\n<p><strong>[Explodo-King]: </strong>what like rn?</p>\n<p><strong>[Half \u2018n Half]: </strong>If you\u2019re not too busy.</p>\n<p>Bakugou\u2019s heart felt like it was about to jump out of his fucking chest, adrenaline suddenly spiking through him.</p>\n<p><strong>[Explodo-King]: </strong>fine. come 2 my room then.</p>\n<p>He received no reply, and somehow he knew that meant Todoroki was probably on his way already.</p>\n<p>Fuck. He couldn\u2019t believe he\u2019d just agreed to that. What the fuck was he supposed to do?</p>\n<p>Somehow this was a completely different situation than making out in a fucking dark movie theater.</p>\n<p><em>There\u2019s no real reason to stop things from going further when you\u2019re in the dorms</em>, a voice in his mind pipped up, and he had a moment of internal panic when he realized that was actually true.</p>\n<p>Shit.</p>\n<p>Self-control suddenly sounded a helluva lot more difficult when you had the object of your affections willingly in your room. Alone. With a nice, comfy bed available.</p>\n<p><em>Fuck</em>.</p>\n<p>There was a tentative knock on his door. Bakugou jumped, cursing at himself for being so fucking <em>stupid</em> about this.</p>\n<p>He was just going to show Todoroki how to leave a hickey on someone. Probably. Which would likely involve either leaving another on Todoroki, or Todoroki leaving one on <em>him</em>.</p>\n<p>\u201cFuck fuck fuck,\u201d he muttered, scrubbing a hand over his face in an effort to reign himself in before he pulled the door open.</p>\n<p>Todoroki stood on the otherside, a neutral expression in his face, the eerie quiet of the hallway seeming to follow him into the room.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell? Are you fucking coming in or what?\u201d Bakugou asked, gesturing sharply at him to come inside.</p>\n<p>Once the door shut behind them both, Bakugou forced himself to take a deep breath, trying to keep rational about this.</p>\n<p>He had no idea what the fuck he was doing. Or what Todoroki was doing, for that matter.</p>\n<p>\u201cAlright, explain to me what the hell it is you\u2019re wanting right now. Because I honestly don\u2019t fucking know anymore,\u201d Bakugou finally said, breaking the quiet and opting for complete and utter sincerity for once.</p>\n<p>Todoroki\u2019s face colored slightly, but he tilted his head to the side, pointing at his neck where a vibrant redish purple mark sat prominently right over his pulse.</p>\n<p>Bakugou\u2019s heart skipped a beat, something possessive roaring inside him with victory at the sight.</p>\n<p>\u201cI want to know how you did this,\u201d Todoroki said, voice too calm for Bakugou\u2019s liking. \u201cAnd I want to know how to do it to someone else.\u201d</p>\n<p>Bakugou swallowed, feeling his palms break out in a sweat. \u201cAre you asking for a demonstration?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you willing to give me one?\u201d Todoroki asked, the first hint of nerves showing in the way his voice sounded slightly strained.</p>\n<p>Bakugou took a step forward, feeling a little more confident at the show of weakness.</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you fucking asking me to <em>mark you</em>?\u201d he wondered aloud, his voice low. Dark. Bakugou saw the way the sound if it made Todoroki\u2019s eyes widen. He took another step forward.</p>\n<p>He brought a hand up, reaching out to lightly trace the bruise on Todoroki\u2019s neck with the pad of his index finger and reveling in the way Todoroki shivered in response.</p>\n<p>One of Todoroki\u2019s hands came up abruptly to grasp Bakugou firmly by the wrist, stopping the motion against his skin instantly.</p>\n<p>Bakugou froze. He opened his mouth to say something, hell, maybe even to apologize, suddenly worried he\u2019d crossed a line, but Todoroki spoke before he could get a word out.</p>\n<p>\u201cI am,\u201d he said, voice firm. \u201cI don\u2019t have a lot of experience with this sort of thing,\u201d he admitted. \u201cBut you said you do, right?\u201d</p>\n<p>Bakugou couldn\u2019t believe what he was hearing. \u201cRight,\u201d he agreed.</p>\n<p>\u201cI know this isn\u2019t explicitly part of our deal,\u201d Todoroki went on, \u201cBut I\u2019d like to learn whatever you\u2019re willing to teach me.\u201d</p>\n<p><em>Whatever you\u2019re willing to teach</em>, Bakugou\u2019s mind repeated, over and over, until the words stopped making sense.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat the fuck are you actually asking for?\u201d he asked, voice cracking. He was too stunned to even care.</p>\n<p>Todoroki, for his part, looked slightly terrified. \u201cFor whatever you\u2019re willing to give me.\u201d</p>\n<p>This couldn\u2019t be real. There was no way.</p>\n<p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t like something, you tell me to stop,\u201d Bakugou said, voice rough with repressed emotion as he leaned in slowly.</p>\n<p>Todoroki\u2019s eyes fluttered closed, Bakugou\u2019s doing the same a moment later. \u201cI\u2019m not <em>going</em> to tell you to stop, Bakugou,\u201d Todoroki whispered, their lips brushing with the words.</p>\n<p>Something in Bakugou came undone.</p>\n<p>They pressed against one another, Bakugou wrapping his arms around Todoroki fully, pulling him flush against his chest, Todoroki repeating the action in kind. They kissed, mouths open and hot, god, so fucking <em>hot</em>, the two of them sharing the same air between them with greedy sighs and quiet gasps of breath.</p>\n<p>Bakugou steadily walked Todoroki backwards until the backs of his legs hit the edge of his bed, Todoroki pulling away from him with a surprised jolt.</p>\n<p>\u201cLay down,\u201d Bakugou told him, his breath sounding labored.</p>\n<p>Todoroki sat on the edge of the bed, allowing Bakugou to push him down as he climbed on top of him much like he had the day before.</p>\n<p><em>I could do this forever and fucking like every minute of it</em>, Bakugou realized distractedly, knowing it was true.</p>\n<p>He was too busy taking in the sight of Todoroki stretched out <em>on his own fucking bed</em> to think about it for very long, though.</p>\n<p>They left off right where they\u2019d been the day before, making out for who knew how long, the wet glide of tongues and the sharp feel of teeth making Bakugou lose track of time. At some point, Bakugou finally couldn\u2019t stand it any longer.</p>\n<p>\u201cTake this off,\u201d he mumbled against the underside of Todoroki\u2019s jaw, tugging at his shirt with a frustrated noise.</p>\n<p>He felt more than heard Todoroki\u2019s sharp intake of breath. \u201cFine. But only if you take yours off, too.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Fine</em>,\u201d Bakugou said, pulling back to whip his over his head in short order, because that <em>did</em> seem like a fair request he guessed.</p>\n<p>He looked down at Todoroki impatiently, but Todoroki seemed frozen, his gaze locked on Bakugou\u2019s torso like he was physically incapable of looking away.</p>\n<p>Bakugou felt himself flushing from the undivided attention. \u201cWhat? You\u2019ve seen me shirtless before. It\u2019s not a big fucking deal.\u201d</p>\n<p>Which was true. They\u2019d shared changing rooms for years. This wasn\u2019t anything new.</p>\n<p>\u201cNot like this I haven\u2019t,\u201d Todoroki answered, raising one hand to run it reverently along the planes of Bakugou\u2019s abs, which tensed at the touch. Todoroki licked his lips distractedly, eyes roving lower, and Bakugou felt his blood rush immediately south.</p>\n<p>Who was supposed to be the experienced one here again? <em>Fuck.</em></p>\n<p>\u201cWhatever,\u201d Bakugou mumbled, finally managing to wrestle Todoroki\u2019s shirt awkwardly over his head.</p>\n<p>And then Bakugou was having a crisis of his own, staring down at the sight before him.</p>\n<p>The pale skin on display was almost too good to be true, smooth and lean and muscular in a way that drove Bakugou absolutely mad. Bakugou could see a few scars scattered here and there and had a strange desire to kiss each and every one.</p>\n<p>\u201cI call bullshit,\u201d Bakugou blurted, running his fingers over Todoroki\u2019s chest.</p>\n<p>Todoroki blinked, finally looking away from Bakugou\u2019s exposed skin to give him a confused look. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThis is unfair,\u201d Bakugou said, his mouth running without a filter. \u201cNo one warned me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWarned you?\u201d Todoroki asked, his head tilting slightly.</p>\n<p>Bakugou let one finger trace across Todoroki\u2019s right nipple, Todoroki giving a startled groan, his back arching into the touch as his eyes fluttered closed.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat you were this fucking beautiful,\u201d Bakugou finished, Todoroki\u2019s eyes flying open just before Bakugou leaned forward and kissed him for all he was worth.</p>\n<p>Todoroki wrapped his arms around Bakugou\u2019s waist, pulling him down to lie against him fully, the feeling of skin on skin almost too much for Bakugou to handle. He moaned at the contact, loving the heat, the feeling of controlled power lurking in every subtle shift and move of Todoroki\u2019s body turning him on more thoroughly than just about anything else ever could.</p>\n<p>Bakugou knew he would never forget this. Something instinctive in him told him this was an experience he\u2019d best treasure while he had it, because it was the sort that didn\u2019t come along often.</p>\n<p>He was suddenly fucking hell-bent on making <em>damn </em>sure Todoroki never forgot this night either.</p>\n<p>He pulled back, moving down Todoroki\u2019s torso and slowly working his lips against every bit of Todoroki he could reach until he had him gasping and writhing beneath him.</p>\n<p>Bakugou moved lower still, licking his way slowly down Todoroki\u2019s navel and not stopping until he reached the waistline of his jeans. He tugged them down just enough to expose the sharp jut of his hips, raising his eyes to lock with Todoroki\u2019s own.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou wanted to know how to leave a mark?\u201d Bakugou asked.</p>\n<p>Todoroki made a choked noise before nodding, eyes wide.</p>\n<p>\u201cThen fucking watch and learn something,\u201d Bakugou breathed, flashing his teeth before leaning down to bite at the juncture of Todoroki\u2019s hip sharply.</p>\n<p>He cried out, and Bakugou could see one of his hands fisting in the sheets out of the corner of his eye. Bakugou opened his mouth, licking languidly at the bite mark before sealing his lips over it and giving a harsh suck.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh my god,\u201d Todoroki gasped. Bakugou raised his eyes again to find Todoroki\u2019s gaze locked on him, his eyes wild, his face flushed and wanting.</p>\n<p>Bakugou raised his eyebrows, moving lower, letting his tongue slide suggestively along the hem of Todoroki\u2019s pants before slipping it ever so slightly beneath them.</p>\n<p>Todoroki\u2019s hand suddenly fisted in his hair, though he didn\u2019t push or pull at Bakugou either way.</p>\n<p>Bakugou knew Todoroki was hard. He could feel the heat of it, could smell it even through the layers of clothing.</p>\n<p>He wondered what it would taste like, too.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnyone ever sucked you off before?\u201d Bakugou asked, like it was a perfectly normal topic of conversation.</p>\n<p>The hand in Bakugou\u2019s hair squeezed reflexively, Todoroki\u2019s face reddening even further. \u201cNo,\u201d he answered, sounding strained.</p>\n<p>\u201cWant to change that?\u201d Bakugou offered, trailing a hand along Todoroki\u2019s inner thigh and rubbing distracted little circles into his skin.</p>\n<p>Todoroki shivered, his eyes falling closed as he bit his bottom lip. \u201c<em>Yes</em>,\u201d he said in a rush.</p>\n<p>\u201cThen take your fucking pants off,\u201d Bakugou murmured, licking his lips. \u201cI don\u2019t have all night.\u201d</p>\n<p>Except that he kind of did, and they both knew it.</p>\n<p>Todoroki looked like he was about to combust, his eyes almost wide enough that Bakugou wondered if they might fall right out of his head. Bakugou briefly wondered if Todoroki would complain about the fact that Bakugou wasn\u2019t removing any more of his own clothing, but was surprised when he made no further comment, hands simply dropping to his waist to undo the button of his jeans.</p>\n<p>Bakugou\u2019s eyes honed in on the movement, watching as Todoroki slid down the zipper before lifting up his hips and sliding them down over the swell of his ass.</p>\n<p>There was a very obvious tent in his boxers. Bakugou thought it was probably weird that the sight made his mouth water, but he couldn\u2019t be bothered to give a shit.</p>\n<p>He settled himself in between Todoroki\u2019s legs, getting comfortable before pressing his open mouth against the skin of his navel again. He let his tongue trace lower, dipping under the hem of Todoroki\u2019s boxers once more, able to go much farther now that the jeans were out of the way.</p>\n<p>Todoroki\u2019s hand was suddenly back in his hair, sifting through the strands almost in silent wonder. Bakugou hooked his fingers around the top of the fabric of his boxers, glancing up at him briefly before pulling down to expose Todoroki\u2019s flushed cock.</p>\n<p>His mouth actually watered. He wasn\u2019t sure he\u2019d ever been this turned on his in life.</p>\n<p>He leaned down, opening his mouth to let his breath gust warmly over the head, Todoroki\u2019s cock twitching in response.</p>\n<p>Bakugou leaned forward to lick at the skin of his navel again, inhaling the musky scent of arousal\u2014one of those things that Bakugou always found to be ridiculously attractive for some reason. His moved further, tongue tracing through a bead of precum that had found its way from Todoroki\u2019s cock to his abdomen, letting the bitter taste sink into him and licking his lips in response.</p>\n<p>Todoroki\u2019s breathing was labored, the hand in Bakugou\u2019s hair clenching and unclenching with impatience.</p>\n<p>Bakugou smirked.</p>\n<p>He still didn\u2019t put his mouth where Todoroki clearly wanted it most, grinning as he moved lower, biting and sucking marks into the skin of Todoroki\u2019s thighs just to feel them quivering around him.</p>\n<p>\u201cB-Bakugou,\u201d Todoroki bit out, sounding winded. \u201cStop teasing me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Bakugou looked up at him, raising an eyebrow as he breathed hotly against Todoroki again. \u201cWho said I was fucking teasing?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Bakugou</em>,\u201d he hissed, pulling at his hair lightly.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the magic word?\u201d</p>\n<p>Todoroki clamped his mouth shut, clearly fighting with himself internally to keep from begging.</p>\n<p>That was fine. Bakugou liked a challenge.</p>\n<p>He wrapped his fingers loosely around the base of Todoroki\u2019s cock, moving it closer to his mouth\u2014 only to stop just before he could touch it with his lips, licking exaggeratedly at the air just a hairs-breadth away from Todoroki\u2019s skin.</p>\n<p>\u201cF-fuck,\u201d Todoroki cursed, throwing his head back with a frustrated noise. \u201cFine. Please.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat was that?\u201d Bakugou asked again, letting his lips just barely brush the head as he spoke.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Please</em>, dammit,\u201d Todoroki bit out, sounding half broken.</p>\n<p>Bakugou wrapped his mouth around him abruptly, swallowing him down as far as he could go.</p>\n<p>Todoroki cried out, clearly not expecting that, falling back slightly against the bed. His hand pulled almost painfully tight in Bakugou\u2019s hair now, the feeling of it going straight to Bakugou\u2019s own cock. He swirled his tongue, licking the entire shaft before taking him in again, able to go even further this time, Todoroki gasping beneath him.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh my god,\u201d he chanted, voice strained. \u201cOh my god, Bakugou. I\u2014slow down, please, or I\u2019ll\u2014\u201c</p>\n<p>Bakugou pulled off, giving Todoroki a moment to catch his breath. He looked at him, amusement gleaming in his eyes. \u201cThat\u2019s kind of the idea, idiot.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI <em>know</em> that, but I\u2019m\u2014\u201c Todoroki broke of, sounding as though words were difficult.</p>\n<p>\u201cHaving fun?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Yes</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t want it to end too soon?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cExactly,\u201d he breathed, sounding relieved.</p>\n<p>Bakugou hummed as though considering this. \u201cToo bad. I\u2019m not that nice.\u201d</p>\n<p>Before Todoroki had a chance to respond, Bakugou\u2019s mouth was back around him, pressing down as far as he could go, taking whatever he couldn\u2019t swallow in his hand and pumping in time with the movement of his mouth. He flattened his tongue, letting it glide smoothly over the underside of Todoroki\u2019s cock, pressing down harder each time he reached the tip. His pace was unrelenting, fast and hard, and he could feel Todoroki falling apart rapidly as a result.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Ah</em>, Bakugou,\u201d Todoroki cried out, hands letting go of Bakugou\u2019s hair to fist in the sheets of the bed, his harsh breathing echoing in the small room. \u201cOh, god.\u201d</p>\n<p>Bakugou hummed encouragingly, lips still around Todoroki\u2019s cock, Todoroki\u2019s legs shaking beneath him in response. \u201cBakugou, please, I\u2019m\u2014I\u2019m going to\u2014\u201c</p>\n<p>Bakugou knew damn good and well he was about to come, and he wanted it more than he\u2019d ever wanted just about anything in his life.</p>\n<p>He gave a particularly hard suck, twisting his hand and swirling his tongue just right, eyes looking up to lock with Todoroki\u2019s as he watched him move over his cock.</p>\n<p>Todoroki threw his head back with a silent shout, his entire body seizing up as he came down Bakugou\u2019s throat, Bakugou gladly swallowing everything given to him.</p>\n<p>He wiped his mouth when he was done, moving further back up the bed to lie beside Todoroki with a grin. There were few things more fun than knowing he\u2019d successfully given someone one of the best orgams of their life. And Bakugou was certain it <em>was</em> one of the best. He was the best at everything, after all.</p>\n<p>Todoroki\u2019s eyes were closed as he gasped for air, chest rising and falling as he tried to catch is breath. His face looked more relaxed and at peace than Bakugou had ever seen it, the sight of it twisting something in Bakugou\u2019s chest.</p>\n<p>Without thinking, he reached one hand out, tracing it along the curve of Todoroki\u2019s cheek gently, his eyes blinking open as he turned his head to look at him with an awed expression.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat was\u2014\u201c Todoroki started, seeming unable to continue.</p>\n<p>Bakugou\u2019s grin widened. \u201cGreat?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat is a <em>severe</em> understatement,\u201d Todoroki told him.</p>\n<p>Bakugou snorted. \u201cObviously.\u201d</p>\n<p>He received a surprised laugh in response, Todoroki\u2019s hand reaching up to tangle with his. Bakugou\u2019s heart gave another tug, thinking it was too sweet somehow, but he didn\u2019t try and stop him.</p>\n<p>\u201cI want to make you come,\u201d Todoroki said suddenly, Bakugou\u2019s grin dropping from his face instantly, an embarrassed flush rising it it\u2019s place.</p>\n<p>He scowled, uncomfortable to suddenly be the center of attention. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sure I don\u2019t,\u201d Todoroki agreed. \u201cBut I want to.\u201d</p>\n<p><em>I want to</em>. Bakugou couldn\u2019t get past the words.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell I\u2019m not stupid enough to stop you if you\u2019re offering,\u201d he told him instead, but his voice came out far too soft.</p>\n<p>Todoroki tucked himself back into his boxers before rolling over, pressing Bakugou back against the bed and laying half on top of him. He bent down, kissing him gently, the passion and the rush they were in earlier seemingly forgotten in favor of slow and curious now that Todoroki was sated.</p>\n<p>Bakugou felt himself flushing at the attention, conflicted. He didn\u2019t know how to respond to this. Bakugou hadn\u2019t exactly had a lot partners, true, but the ones he <em>did</em> have had never taken their time with him like this.</p>\n<p>Todoroki took Bakugou apart methodically, like he was a puzzle Todoroki was trying to figure out, seeming intent on finding all the places that made Bakugou\u2019s breathing sharpen and his voice turn breathy. His hands wandered along his skin, slowly working their way to his shorts before sliding them carefully down.</p>\n<p>\u201cIs it alright if I use my hands?\u201d Todoroki asked, seeming unsure. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I\u2019m ready to try what you just did.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s\u2014more than fine,\u201d Bakugou replied, breath coming to him in gasps already. He hadn\u2019t expected to get anything in return at all, honestly.</p>\n<p>He also liked the idea of Todoroki using his hands in general, because it meant Bakugou could keep kissing him, which he found himself strangely reluctant to stop.</p>\n<p>Todoroki paused, raising his palm to his mouth and slicking it generously with his tongue. Bakugou felt his eyes darken, tracking the motion hungrily.</p>\n<p>\u201cFuck,\u201d he murmured, Todoroki smirking at him briefly before lowering his hand again to wrap around Bakugou\u2019s straining cock and giving a slow, firm stroke.</p>\n<p>Bakugou\u2019s head fell back against the pillow, his eyes falling closed. \u201cGod, yeah. Just like that.\u201d</p>\n<p>Todoroki\u2019s head fell to the crook of Bakugou\u2019s neck as he continued to pump him, keeping up the same slow, hard rhythm, Bakugou\u2019s arms wrapped around his waist and skating along the skin of his back distractedly. He felt something warm and wet lick at the skin of his shoulder, Todoroki slowly working his way up Bakugou\u2019s neck with his mouth before biting down suddenly at the juncture of his collar bone.</p>\n<p>Bakugou arched up beneath him, crying out, eyes flying wide. Fuck, it felt <em>so good</em>, Todoroki\u2019s mouth sucking at his skin as if trying to devour him.</p>\n<p>\u201cFuck, <em>yes</em>,\u201d he gasped, his hips thrusting forward unconsciously, Todoroki speeding up his pace slightly in response, his tongue still working along his throat. \u201cGod, you\u2019re so good, <em>shit</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re surprisingly vocal during sex,\u201d Todoroki murmured into his ear, biting gently at the soft skin of his ear lobe and giving a light tug. \u201cI like it,\u201d he continued, voice husky, his hand tightening around Bakugou\u2019s shaft at the words.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh god, don\u2019t stop, please, <em>ah</em>, fuck, <em>fuck</em>,\u201d Bakugou babbled, eyes squeezing shut, feeling his desire peaking, everything coiling into one white-hot point within him.</p>\n<p>Todoroki pulled back to seal his mouth over Bakugou\u2019s, his tongue sliding sinfully against his own.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re amazing,\u201d Todoroki breathed against his mouth, voice full of wonder.</p>\n<p>And just like that, Bakugou was gone.</p>\n<p>He threw his head back, crying out loudly as he came, Todoroki\u2019s name falling from his lips.</p>\n<p>His brain was swimming, his whole body seizing up before suddenly feeling completely lax, everything warm and comfortable. He opened his eyes in a daze to find Todoroki gazing down at him, his eyes wide. He had that same fucking <em>look </em>on his face again, like Bakugou had just shown him something he could hardly believe was real.</p>\n<p>Bakugou was in no shape to deal with that shit right now, so he simply wrapped his arms tighter around Todoroki, pulling him down against him and not giving a shit about the fact that he had come all over his stomach. Todoroki didn\u2019t seem to mind too much either, to be fair, if the way he curled up around Bakugou was anything to go by.</p>\n<p>They lay there in silence, Bakugou\u2019s heart slowly calming. The way it felt to be curled up in bed like this with Todoroki felt far, far too easy. It was wonderful. Bakugou hadn\u2019t ever felt anything in his life he felt comfortable calling wonderful before. It was like being given a gift he hadn\u2019t ever expected to receive, and now wondered how he\u2019d ever lived without.</p>\n<p>Except it wasn\u2019t his gift to receive, because none of this was real.</p>\n<p>The realization washed over him like a bucket of ice cold water, Bakugou\u2019s heart freezing.</p>\n<p>\u00a0All at once, he was suddenly fucking angry.</p>\n<p>He\u2019d never wanted a relationship with <em>anyone</em> for fucks sake, and yet here he was, mooning over the guy who was just using him as a way to get back at his father.</p>\n<p>He hated himself. He couldn\u2019t believe what he\u2019d just done, knowing full well what he couldn\u2019t fucking have.</p>\n<p>Something hot and bitter coiled low in his stomach.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, I hope you learned something,\u201d he said evenly, glaring at the ceiling.</p>\n<p>Todoroki made a contented sort of hum. \u201cI think I learned several things,\u201d he answered, sounding happy.</p>\n<p>That only made Bakugou angrier.</p>\n<p>\u201cGreat. Happy to be of fucking service,\u201d he replied, disentangling himself from Todoroki abruptly. \u201cYou can go now.\u201d</p>\n<p>Todoroki sat up, looking like he\u2019d been slapped. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI said <em>you can go</em>. Get out of my room. You got what you wanted.\u201d</p>\n<p>Bakugou made the mistake of looking him in the eye briefly before snapping his head away to glare at the door, gesturing to it angrily.</p>\n<p>A heavy tension settled between them. After a moment, Todoroki climbed off the bed, collecting his discarded clothing before throwing it all on in silence.</p>\n<p>He left the room without another word, slamming the door behind him.</p>\n<p>Bakugou tried everything he could, but couldn\u2019t get the look of hurt Todoroki had worn on his face out of his head.</p>\n<p>Bakugou didn\u2019t sleep that night, either.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The next morning, he woke up to a picture of the two of them gracing the front page of just about every news source he came across.</p>\n<p>It was a photo of them kissing on a street corner, their hands clasped, Bakugou\u2019s free hand loving resting against the side of Todoroki\u2019s face as their mouths pressed sweetly to each other. Todoroki had such a fond expression on his face, a smile resting on the corners of his mouth.</p>\n<p>Bakugou wanted to cry.</p>\n<p>He didn\u2019t go to class. He didn\u2019t think he could bare it if he did.</p>\n<p>Bitterness simmered under every last inch of his skin. He could still feel Todoroki\u2019s lips against his own if he closed his eyes.</p>\n<p>When he looked in the mirror, he laughed humorlessly, realizing his neck was covered in bite marks. The sight of it made him feel sick with longing.</p>\n<p>Around lunch time, he finally received a text.</p>\n<p><strong>[Half \u2018n Half]:</strong> We made the front page. I guess we don\u2019t need to go on any more dates after all.</p>\n<p>Bakugou didn\u2019t reply, and after an hour, he finally received another.</p>\n<p><strong>[Half \u2018n Half]: </strong>Thank you.</p>\n<p>Bakugou threw his phone across the room, hearing it crash loudly against his dresser and hoping it shattered.</p>\n<p>He buried his face in his pillow, pretending the water soaking into the fabric beneath him didn\u2019t exist.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYooo, Bakugou,\u201d a voice called from the other side of the door.</p>\n<p>Bakugou blinked his eyes for what felt like the first time in hours, his gaze drifting from the ceiling to look toward the source of the noise.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou ok man? You weren\u2019t in class and we didn\u2019t see you at lunch,\u201d another voice called.</p>\n<p>\u201cMaybe he\u2019s not here,\u201d Kaminari thought out loud.</p>\n<p>He heard Kirishima make a confused sort of noise and could almost see his frown through the door. \u201cWhere else would he be, though?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOn a run? At the gym? Visiting his mom? Who knows, man.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBakugou, if you\u2019re in there, I\u2019m coming back to check on you later. And I won\u2019t take no for an answer, I\u2019ll break the door down if I have to. You know I\u2019m serious.\u201d</p>\n<p>Bakugou closed his eyes. He didn\u2019t reply.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe fuck is going on. Todoroki looked really upset today too. Almost heartbroken,\u201d he heard Kaminari say as they moved down the hall.</p>\n<p>Bakugou sat up in bed abruptly, straining to hear the conversation.</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, man. You don\u2019t think they actually broke up, do you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo way. Even Bakugou isn\u2019t stupid enough to let someone like Todoroki out of his grasp,\u201d he heard, their voices slowly fading away.</p>\n<p>Bakugou stood, walking across the room in a daze and leaning his head against the closed door, his eyes burning. He looked down, noticing his phone, which was disappointingly not broken.</p>\n<p>He picked it up numbly, unlocking it and dialing the only number he knew by heart.</p>\n<p>\u201cMom?\u201d he said into the receiver, voice thick. \u201cI\u2026 need some help.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The next day dawned, bright and clear, and with it dawned a tentative renewal of Bakugou\u2019s hope.</p>\n<p>He had a fucking plan now, thanks to his mother. He\u2019d spent most of the night telling her absolutely everything (though he did skimp on some of the finer details of his sex life, to be fair) and in true Bakugou fashion, she\u2019d found a way for him to fix things.</p>\n<p>Or at least, a way for him to do <em>something</em>, dammit.</p>\n<p>He checked his phone after breakfast, seeing a text from his mother.</p>\n<p><strong>[Old Hag]: </strong>Meeting the reporter to give an interview at 2pm kiddo. I\u2019ll let you know how it goes. Make sure you go to class today dammit. No more sulking.</p>\n<p>He sent back a hasty reply, but walked to class with a smile on his face for the first time in what felt like years.</p>\n<p>He might have fucked things up with Todoroki, but he wasn\u2019t going to stop until he\u2019d done everything he could to help him.</p>\n<p>He wished he could see the look on Endeavor\u2019s face.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>By the time the weekend rolled around, Bakugou was ready. Which was wise, because there was an absolute shit-storm waiting for him when he woke up Saturday morning.</p>\n<p>He had about fifteen unopened texts and several missed calls\u2014none from Todoroki, he noted, not bothering to open the rest.</p>\n<p>He clicked on the app that connected him to the hero news network, seeing his own face first thing.</p>\n<p>There was a picture of himself kissing Todoroki on the street corner, only this time a photo of Bakugou\u2019s parents appeared next to it, his mother grinning in a way that looked utterly victorious.</p>\n<p><u>The New Generation of Hero Romance!<br>\n</u> <em>Mitsuki Bakugou gives us an inclusive interview about her son, Bakugou Katsuki, and his new budding romance with Endeavor\u2019s son Todoroki Shouto!</em></p>\n<p>Bakugou scanned the article, honing in on a few snippets here and there. One stood out to him more than the rest.</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cMy son is head over heels for that boy,\u201d Mitsuki told Hero Action News. \u201cHe\u2019s never been so serious about anyone else in his whole life. It\u2019s frankly a bit terrifying, but I can\u2019t think of anyone who\u2019d be a better match for my kid\u2019s explosive personality.\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>Bakugou blushed, skipping towards the bottom of the interview.</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cI encourage you to hit up Endeavor for an interview next. I\u2019m sure he\u2019d love to talk about how happy and in love Shouto is,\u201d Mitsuki told this reporter. \u201cHe\u2019s so proud of that boy. A constant well of support for his son. I\u2019m sure he\u2019d be thrilled at the chance to gush to you about one of the world\u2019s next top heroes!\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>This reporter contacted Endeavor Hero Office yesterday and is happy to report that we have a scheduled interview with Todoroki Endeavor in the works for early next week! Look forward to hearing more from us at Hero Action News soon! And to the two happy love birds, best wishes from us all!</em>\n</p>\n<p>Bakugou sat his phone down on his bedside table before standing up, walking over to his closet to pull on some fresh clothes. He selected his outfit carefully, as per his mother\u2019s advice, going for something slightly less aggressive in appearance than he usually would.</p>\n<p>What he ended up pulling on was a white tank-top, one of the few articles of clothing he owned that was <em>not </em>black, and a pair of blue jeans that weren\u2019t baggy, black, <em>or</em> camo print.</p>\n<p>He figured that was about the best he could do.</p>\n<p>When he was finished, he turned to look at himself in the mirror. He looked reasonably more angelic than usual. Or at least, not <em>entirely</em> fucking demonic for once.</p>\n<p>He grabbed his phone, shoving it in his pocket as he turned to leave the room before glancing one last time at his reflection in the mirror.</p>\n<p>Hope swelled in his chest, and as stupid as it sounded, Bakugou was reluctant to try and stop it.</p>\n<p>He was fucking smiling. He couldn\u2019t stop, and honestly, he didn\u2019t really want to.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Once he was out in the hallway, he whipped his phone back out, texting as he walked towards the stairs.</p>\n<p><strong>[Explodo-King]: </strong>r u busy right now?</p>\n<p>He was pleased when he got a response almost immediately. A part of him had been scared he wouldn\u2019t get one at all.</p>\n<p><strong>[Half \u2018n Half]:</strong> I\u2019m not busy, no.</p>\n<p>Well. That wasn\u2019t\u2026 <em>discouraging</em>, exactly. But close.</p>\n<p>Bakugou shook it off though, determined.</p>\n<p><strong>[Explodo-King]: </strong>meet me outside.</p>\n<p><strong>[Half \u2018n Half]: </strong>Right now?</p>\n<p><strong>[Explodo-King]: </strong>yeah</p>\n<p><strong>[Half \u2018n Half]:</strong> Why?</p>\n<p><strong>[Explodo-King]: </strong>just fucking do it ok? please.</p>\n<p>The please was hard to type, but not as hard as he thought it would be. He guessed some things were easier to sacrifice his pride for than others. Todoroki Shouto\u2019s affection appeared to be one of them.</p>\n<p>He was all the way at the bottom of the stairs when he finally got a reply.</p>\n<p><strong>[Half \u2018n Half]: </strong>Fine. I\u2019ll be there in a minute.</p>\n<p>He stuffed his phone back in his pocket, fighting off the urge to pump his fist in victory as he walked out the front doors and stood out on the concrete in the early morning sun.</p>\n<p>Except he couldn\u2019t sit still, because he was fucking nervous as hell, so he just ended up pacing back and forth on the sidewalk, a scowl on his face. He kept running his hand through is hair, a nervous gesture he sometimes had.</p>\n<p>About five minutes later, the front door of the dorms swung open. Bakugou froze, looking up with wide eyes to find Todoroki stepping out onto the sidewalk.</p>\n<p>Bakugou had never thought he\u2019d be glad to see Todoroki, and yet here he was, happy to be being glared at. He was clearly out of his fucking mind.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell?\u201d Todoroki prompted, sounding just polite enough to not be considered rude. \u201cWhat did you want?\u201d</p>\n<p>Bakugou squaring his shoulders. \u201cDid you see the hero news this morning?\u201d</p>\n<p>Todoroki scowled, crossing his arms over his chest, his eyes darting away from Bakugou\u2019s. \u201cI did.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd the interview my mom gave?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes. What of it?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re free now,\u201d Bakugou said, taking a step forward. \u201cDon\u2019t you get it?\u201d</p>\n<p>Todoroki\u2019s eyes flicked back to him, his eyebrows drawing down in confusion.</p>\n<p>\u201cMy mother <em>publically acknowledged</em> you\u2019re dating me. There\u2019s a picture of us kissing with the article, for fucks sake. And at the end, she said they should contact Endeavor for an interview, too. And they <em>did.</em> And he fucking <em>agreed to give one</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>Todoroki\u2019s eyes widened, understanding dawning on him.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe can\u2019t deny anything now without making himself look bad,\u201d Bakugou continued. \u201cHe\u2019s going to be forced to come out in support of you if he doesn\u2019t want to hurt his precious fucking image.\u201d</p>\n<p>Todoroki looked absolutely stunned, his mouth falling open. \u201cYou\u2026 set this up. For me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah. Yeah, I fucking did,\u201d Bakugou agreed, something warm and elated rising dangerously in his chest.</p>\n<p>Todoroki\u2019s expression flashed with pain for a moment before settling back into something more neutral, but the tremor in his voice betrayed him when he said, \u201cBut <em>why</em>? You don\u2019t even like me, why would you\u2014\u201c</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t be a fucking idiot,\u201d Bakugou cut in, taking a step forward. \u201cLook. Honestly, I didn\u2019t really even call you out here to talk about the fucking article.\u201d</p>\n<p>He watched Todoroki\u2019s expression falter, his arms finally dropping to his sides. \u201cThen why <em>did </em>you call me out here?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cRemember that one request you owe me for doing all this shit? I\u2019m fucking calling it in.\u201d</p>\n<p>Todoroki\u2019s eyes registered shock, his hands twitching. Bakugou stepped closer again, Todoroki backing up half a step before seeming to forget there was a closed door behind him as he came into contact with it.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou swore. Any one request,\u201d Bakugou reminded him, eyes a silent challenge.</p>\n<p>Todoroki nodded, eyes steeling with resolve. \u201cI did. Name it, and it\u2019s yours.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFucking wonderful,\u201d Bakugou said, taking one final step forward and reaching out to clasp Todoroki\u2019s hand in his own without further comment. \u201cThen from today on, you\u2019re dating me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Todoroki\u2019s mouth dropped open. \u201c<em>What</em>?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMy request, idiot. Date me for real,\u201d Bakugou answered with a scowl, bringing Todoroki\u2019s hand up to his mouth to plant a kiss across his knuckles briefly.</p>\n<p>He watched Todoroki shake his head in disbelief. \u201cYou have to be kidding. There\u2019s no way you\u2014you <em>kicked me out of your room</em> after we\u2014\u201c</p>\n<p>\u201cI was a fucking idiot, alright? I was mad because I thought you were just\u2014just fucking <em>using</em> me or something, and I\u2014\u201c Bakugou took a deep breath, swallowing his pride. \u201cI wanted it to be real. And I was pissed because it wasn\u2019t.\u201d</p>\n<p>He wasn\u2019t sure he\u2019d ever been so open and apologetic in his entire life, honestly. But he also knew he\u2019d fucked up royally, and knew exactly where and how, thanks to his fucking mother.</p>\n<p>\u201cLook, I\u2019m sorry, alright?\u201d he muttered, looking down and letting Todoroki\u2019s hand drop reluctantly. \u201cI know I fucked up. And I can\u2019t promise I won\u2019t fuck up again, but I\u2019d at least like the chance not to.\u201d</p>\n<p>If saying sorry was what he had to do to get what he wanted, then he\u2019d fucking do it, goddammit, pride be damned.</p>\n<p>It was weird, realizing there was something he valued more than his own pride.</p>\n<p>He waited, heart aching painfully behind his ribs. This was the part he\u2019d dreaded most, truth be told. It was one thing to have control over his own fate; it was another thing entirely to let his fate rest on the decisions of someone else. It made him feel vulnerable in a way almost nothing else ever had.</p>\n<p>Two hands suddenly grasped either side of his face, hauling him forward with enough force to make him stumble, Bakugou\u2019s hands landing on Todoroki\u2019s shoulders in an effort to keep himself upright. Todoroki\u2019s eyes were absolutely blazing, anger and something else dancing in their depths. But he had that fucking <em>look</em> on his face <em>again</em>.</p>\n<p>Bakugou finally thought that this time, he maybe understood what it was.</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t <em>ever</em> do that to me again,\u201d Todoroki threatened, voice wobbling slightly.</p>\n<p>Bakugou swallowed thickly, nodding as much as he could in Todoroki\u2019s hold. \u201cI won\u2019t,\u201d he told him, because he meant it.</p>\n<p>\u201cGood,\u201d Todoroki said with an air of finality. \u201cNow make it up to me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Bakugou\u2019s face drew down into a small frown, his mouth opening to ask how the fuck he was supposed to do that, exactly.</p>\n<p>But before he could say anything, Todoroki sealed his mouth over Bakugou\u2019s own, kissing him with a kind of ferocity that made Bakugou\u2019s knees feel weak. Todoroki\u2019s tongue pushed into his mouth, rough and demanding, and Bakugou moaned in response, not fighting it at all, tilting his head to give him better access and understanding that Todoroki wanted him to know he\u2019d been thoroughly conquered and claimed. That\u2019d he\u2019d lost, and he was at Todoroki\u2019s mercy.</p>\n<p>Frankly, Bakugou wasn\u2019t about to fucking complain.</p>\n<p>Bakugou wasn\u2019t sure how long they stood there pressed up against the door. Eventually, the sound of someone clearing their throat loudly came from behind them, the two of them broking apart, startled.</p>\n<p>\u201cLook, not that I\u2019m not happy for you guys, but can you maybe not block the door at least?\u201d Ochako asked, sounding thoroughly amused.</p>\n<p>\u201cShut the fuck up, angelface,\u201d Bakugou muttered, face beat red as he pulled Todoroki to the side so she could move through the doorway.</p>\n<p>\u201cBy the way, Bakugou. I like your matching neck accessories. Very cute,\u201d she said just as the door closed, winking at them both.</p>\n<p>Bakugou clasped a hand over his neck, almost having forgotten that the marks were <em>still </em>in fact there, even days later. \u201cWe need to work on your technique,\u201d he muttered to Todoroki when she\u2019d left. \u201cYou made them too deep.\u201d</p>\n<p>Todoroki made a noise that sounded like a poorly restrained laugh. \u201cIs that so?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Bakugou said, leaning forward to speak against Todoroki\u2019s ear suggestively. \u201cHow about you come up to my room and I\u2019ll show you how it\u2019s really done?\u201d</p>\n<p>Todoroki shivered. \u201cIs this you offering to make it up to me?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, I\u2019ll make it up to you, alright,\u201d Bakugou promised, nipping at his ear lightly before pulling back with a feral grin.</p>\n<p>They made their way inside, running up the stairs in an unspoken race to Bakugou\u2019s dorm room before pushing each other through the door, Bakugou cursing loudly when he nearly fell on his face as a result.</p>\n<p>They didn\u2019t come out of Bakugou\u2019s room for the rest of the day. When Kirishima, Kaminari, and Izuku began to worry, Ochako made sure to assure them that everything was absolutely fine and that if they wanted to preserve their sanity, it was probably wise to let the two of them be.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><em> <u>A Tale of Fire and Ice: Endeavor Tells All!</u> </em> <u><br>\n</u> <em>Todoroki Enji sat down with Hero Action News to dish the goods on his son\u2019s new beau!</em></p>\n<p>\n<em>Todoroki Enji has always had high hopes for his son, but having his son score one of the biggest names in the up and coming hero scene in this season\u2019s hottest whirlwind romance shocked even the world\u2019s Number Two hero.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cMy son has always been destined for great things,\u201d Endeavor told this reporter last Monday in a one on one interview. \u201cThis was certainly not expected, but Bakugou Katsuki is a formidable rising name in the industry.
