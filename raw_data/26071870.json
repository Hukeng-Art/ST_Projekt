  "text": "<p>Wei Ying has been feeling like a grey, wrung-out, mildewed dishrag for a week when Lan Zhan slopes in from a trip to the store looking blank-faced and awkward and sets a pregnancy test down on the kitchen counter.</p>\n<p>\u201cHuh?\u201d says Wei Ying. Then, \u201c<em>What?</em> No!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt is six weeks since your heat,\u201d says Lan Zhan. \u201cYou spent it with an alpha.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, with <em>you</em>,\u201d Wei Ying says, somewhat petulantly because Lan Zhan has always seemed embarrassed about their arrangement, and that kind of thing stings a little bit. \u201cAnd you\u2019re on birth control. And <em>I\u2019m</em> on birth control, so there\u2019s no fucking way.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo birth control is one hundred percent effective,\u201d says Lan Zhan, and then he does that lethal manoeuvre where his eyes go all serious and soft and says, \u201cPlease.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wei Ying has no defence against that look. So he goes into the bathroom and pees on a stick, and waits impatiently for two minutes because this whole thing is completely pointless. Then he looks at the result and frowns. He compares it to the picture on the box, and frowns again, and feels the prickle of sweat at his armpits. He sticks his head out of the bathroom door.</p>\n<p>\u201cCan you go get me a different one?\u201d</p>\n<p>Wordlessly, Lan Zhan hands over two more little boxes of different brands.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh. You were pretty sure about this, huh,\u201d says Wei Ying, perfectly steady despite the bubbling hysteria in his gut.</p>\n<p>\u201cMn.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWant to share with the class?\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan\u2019s ears go pink. \u201cYour scent,\u201d he says.</p>\n<p>\u201cBullshit.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s\u2026 subtle.\u201d</p>\n<p>So to add to the weirdness of the situation, apparently Lan Zhan has a pregnancy-related super-nose, even though nobody is supposed to be able to tell until like, month four. Wei Ying really wishes he could double down on his call of bullshit, but test number one seems to support the evidence. He looks at tests two and three, and realises he doesn\u2019t have enough piss in him right now for them to be helpful.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna drink some water,\u201d he says. So he does that, and then sits down on the couch and leans up against Lan Zhan while they watch Say Yes to the Dress, and they don\u2019t talk about how Lan Zhan accidentally maybe knocked him up.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">***</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tests two and three agree with test one. Wei Ying is quite literally fucked.</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay,\u201d he says, \u201cwhat the hell do we do now?\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan looks him dead in the eye and says, \u201cWhatever Wei Ying wishes.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wei Ying is very tempted to smack him in the mouth, because that is Not Helpful. What Wei Ying wishes is to not be in this situation in the first place. What Wei Ying wishes is to not be stuck with the bitter irony, that this \u2013 <em>this</em>, not the heats when he was in college and stupid and careless and Jiang Cheng bawled him out and told him what was going to happen \u2013 is how he earns himself a visit to the abortion clinic.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI want you to make me an appointment to get rid of it,\u201d he says. \u201cI have to go throw up.\u201d</p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t. He\u2019s queasy but he doesn\u2019t puke, he just kneels in front of the toilet for long enough that Lan Zhan will have everything covered, and he can emerge and just ask <em>when, where, will you drive me?</em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">***</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He\u2019s always wanted babies. As a teen, he was secretly stoked to present as an omega because it meant he\u2019d be able to have them on his own, even if he didn\u2019t find the mate and the normal life that seemed so far off and implausible. But that was then. Now, having a kid on his own, with no mate, no support, would make the life he\u2019s building for himself totally fall apart. As a junior engineer \u2013 the company\u2019s <em>best</em> junior engineer \u2013 he earns enough that, with Lan Zhan pitching in just a bit more than his fair share of the rent, he can afford to enjoy a decent life and even save some money. But he couldn\u2019t fit a baby in their apartment, even if Lan Zhan would put up with having one around. He\u2019d have to move into some barely affordable shithole, and he wouldn\u2019t have a hope in hell of paying for daycare, so he\u2019d get fired for smuggling his baby into the office, and he\u2019d be back to living on the streets, fighting stray dogs for scraps.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a bean-sized embryo developing inside him right this minute, determinedly dividing and differentiating its cells into something that might have Lan Zhan\u2019s serious little face, or his own smile, and he <em>wants</em> it, and he can\u2019t have it.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">***</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It\u2019s early enough that they can just give him a prescription. At least Lan Zhan\u2019s super-nose saved him from the surgical procedure. It\u2019s still going to be shitty, according to the nice omega nurse\u2019s description of the side-effects, but it could\u2019ve been much worse.</p>\n<p>They fill the script at the pharmacy on the way home. As soon as they get through their front door Wei Ying pours himself a glass of water, but before he can pop open the little blister pack with the first pill the nausea rises again and he has to dive for the kitchen sink, no time to make it to the bathroom. Lan Zhan rubs his back while he pukes, and helps him to the couch afterwards and tucks him under a blanket, and goes back to the kitchen to clear up the mess Wei Ying made. Wei Ying lies there, shaky and limp, and doesn\u2019t think about anything at all.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">***</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWei Ying,\u201d Lan Zhan says three days later. He\u2019s holding the unpopped blister pack.</p>\n<p>Wei Ying wordlessly holds out his hand for it.</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan hesitates. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to take them.\u201d</p>\n<p>It\u2019s such a patently stupid comment that it gets Wei Ying up off the couch to snatch the pack out of his hand and march over to fill another glass of water. He slams into his room, sets the pills and the water on the nightstand, and gets into bed. It\u2019s seven thirty.</p>\n<p>At nine thirty there\u2019s a tap on the door. Lan Zhan ghosts in, dressed in his perfect white pyjamas, hair braided for sleep. He waits just inside, until Wei Ying makes a little noise that he doesn\u2019t want to be a sob but probably is. Then Lan Zhan comes over, pulls the covers back and slides in next to him. Wei Ying is still fully clothed, jeans and hoodie separating their bodies, but Lan Zhan pulls him close, and \u2013 <em>oh</em> \u2013 his scent fills the air. During Wei Ying\u2019s heats that scent is molten pleasure, but the rest of the time it\u2019s like a herb garden under the summer sun, fresh and fragrant. For a while he doesn\u2019t say anything, just holds Wei Ying\u2019s trembling body in his arms. Then, sounding shy and uncertain in a way that isn\u2019t like him at all, he says, \u201cI\u2019m in a position to support a child financially. If you want. I could. I would support you. I would help. I would like to be a parent, even if\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\n<em>Even if it\u2019s with you.</em>\n</p>\n<p>The answer should be an immediate no. Lan Zhan has always been too kind, too considerate. Kind enough to be a steadfast friend when they ended up at the same college, despite all the shit Wei Ying put him through in high school. Kind enough to agree to room together after they graduated, even though it was always going to be an unequal arrangement. Kind enough to say yes when Wei Ying moaned that solo heats were so terrible, and <em>your perfect alpha dick is right in the next room, Lan Zhan, do you know how hard that is to deal with?</em></p>\n<p>Look where that got them.</p>\n<p>He should say no, but he doesn\u2019t. The next day Lan Zhan takes the pills back to the pharmacy to be disposed of and makes another appointment at the omega health clinic.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">***</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSoooooo,\u201d Wei Ying tells his siblings at the safe distance of video chat, \u201cI have news.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat did you do now?\u201d says Jiang Cheng, in a tone that would make Wei Ying pout and complain in any other situation. In this one, though? Yeah, what <em>did</em> he do now?</p>\n<p>\u201cI got myself knocked up,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m gonna have Lan Zhan\u2019s baby.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jiang Cheng is so astonished that there are several seconds of dead silence before he explodes, but when he does, it\u2019s epic.</p>\n<p>After the yelling is over, Wei Ying tells Lan Zhan, \u201cMy sister sends hugs. I think my brother is buying flights so he can come out here to murder you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHm,\u201d says Lan Zhan.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">***</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan doesn\u2019t have much family and most of what he does have is on the elderly and judgemental end of the spectrum, particularly Uncle Qiren who had his heart surgically removed and replaced with the Lan family rulebook. Lan Huan makes up for a lot of that by being the sort of supportive, loving, dedicated big brother that doesn\u2019t usually exist outside of TV. So it\u2019s a shock to Wei Ying that he takes the news <em>worse</em> than Jiang Cheng did.</p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t yell, of course. He doesn\u2019t say anything disapproving. He offers to help in any way he can with a gentle smile on his face and a devastating worry and sadness shining in his liquid Lan eyes.</p>\n<p>\u201cCongratulations, Wei Ying,\u201d he says as they drink the last of their drinks in the fancy tea shop Lan Zhan picked for the conversation. \u201cI hope this makes you happy.\u201d</p>\n<p><em>You\u2019re destroying my brother\u2019s life, you little prick,</em> he doesn\u2019t say. <em>Get your filthy claws out of him, you\u2019re not fit to touch the ground he walks on. </em>And he doesn\u2019t say, <em>Didi, don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll rescue you from this terrible situation, </em>either.</p>\n<p>Instead, he says to Lan Zhan, \u201cLet\u2019s you and me meet again after work tomorrow,\u201d which is basically the same thing.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">***</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan returns from their meeting looking mulish and irritable and carrying an oversized box of the doughnuts Wei Ying has been craving all day.</p>\n<p>\u201cBrother says we must talk,\u201d he says, and sulks off into the kitchen to make tea.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u201cUh. Talk?\u201d says Wei Ying worriedly. \u201cAbout what?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cExpectations,\u201d calls Lan Zhan, barely raising his voice to carry over the sound of the faucet.</p>\n<p>\u00a0And\u2026 okay, Wei Ying has to admit that\u2019s the kind of thing a sensible big brother would suggest. It\u2019s very grownup-sounding. Wei Ying is twenty-four and objects to having to do anything grownup-sounding, but he is also less than seven months away from being a father so he\u2019s going to have to suck it up.</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan brings him tea and a doughnut (on a plate, with a napkin) and then he sits there like a deep mountain pool reflecting the sky, beautiful and quiet and not talking about expectations.</p>\n<p>Wei Ying sighs. \u201cSo, what did your brother mean exactly? We did talk about\u2026 some stuff.\u201d</p>\n<p>They had, in that Wei Ying had said things like, \u201c<em>You\u2019d be okay with us still living together?\u201d </em>and, <em>\u201cYou\u2019ll be able to cover the bills and food and stuff if I can\u2019t work for a while?\u201d</em> and, <em>\u201cYou\u2019re not allowed to change your mind, Lan Zhan, I\u2019m fucking serious. You have to be sure,\u201d</em> and Lan Zhan had hummed his assent to all of it.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe said\u2026\u201d Lan Zhan begins, and sips his tea, which means he\u2019s kind of unsettled and needs time to think. \u201cWill I have the right to see my child?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to be <em>living</em> with your child.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLater. If we no longer live together. Will I\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat the fuck?\u201d says Wei Ying. He wants to go punch Lan Huan for putting that look on Lan Zhan\u2019s face, and kind of wants to punch himself for being enough of an uncommunicative dumbass that it <em>could</em> be put there. \u201cOf course you will. It\u2019s your baby too.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe are unmated. You have no obligation to put my name on the birth certificate.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell I\u2019m going to! Unless you don\u2019t want me to?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI want you to.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay,\u201d says Wei Ying, and finds his voice is shaking a little. \u201cI\u2019m not cheating my kid out of the chance of having you as a dad. It\u2019ll be ours. Equal partners.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan\u2019s mouth softens into a slight curve. \u201cI would like that,\u201d he says. Then he takes a steadying breath and says, \u201cAlso\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh god. What?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSeeing other people.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wei Ying\u2019s stomach does a sideways triple flip.</p>\n<p>\u201cWei Ying?\u201d says Lan Zhan, looking at him with intense concern.</p>\n<p>\u201cI just feel a bit...\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan whisks the remainder of the doughnut out of sight and fetches the bag of ginger candies instead. Wei Ying sucks on one, taking careful, shallow breaths through his nose, until the nausea subsides.</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay,\u201d he says, plastering on a smile. \u201cI\u2019m good. What were we talking about?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">***</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Of course he\u2019s thought about it.</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan is his best friend, tied with his sister for his favourite person in the world, and an alpha, and gorgeous. Wei Ying is only human. Of course he\u2019s thought about it.</p>\n<p>But. Lan Zhan is his <em>best friend</em>, and Wei Ying had come close to fucking that up with the \u201c<em>Hey, can I sit on your dick?</em>\u201d request. And also, it would never work out between them. Lan Zhan puts up with Wei Ying\u2019s antics as a friend, but he\u2019s certainly not the kind of person who would <em>date</em> a hyperactive loudmouth with authority issues and a habit of waking up after a night out with half his clothes missing and fuzzy memories of extremely regrettable decisions. Equally, Wei Ying is not the type to date a fuddy-duddy who goes to bed at nine and thinks that playing the guqin alone in his room is as exciting as a hobby needs to be.</p>\n<p>Come to think of it, they\u2019re so different that they have no business raising a child together. Perhaps Wei Ying should have thought about <em>that.</em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">***</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u00a0</p>\n<p>It\u2019s weird how normal life is. Wei Ying goes to work every day and doesn\u2019t drink coffee, meets up with friends and doesn\u2019t drink alcohol, and spends most of his time hanging out with Lan Zhan.</p>\n<p>They\u2019re not telling anyone but their siblings yet. Wei Ying is not good at keeping his mouth shut most of the time but he\u2019s feeling weirdly private about this. Protective, like it\u2019s his secret to be nurtured. So he develops a range of entertaining lies \u2013 \u201cI\u2019m giving up alcohol for New Year! Did I ever tell you how my family celebrate New Year in May?\u201d \u2013 and mostly gets away with it.</p>\n<p>Nie Huaisang, who\u2019s been Wei Ying\u2019s desk buddy for nearly a year, isn\u2019t buying it, but neither is he buying Wei Ying being pregnant so he\u2019s basically just really confused.</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t get it,\u201d he says. \u201cYou can\u2019t be. Why would you be? Babies are terrible!\u201d</p>\n<p>Wei Ying laughs himself silly. \u201cA-Sang, I\u2019m not pregnant,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s a social experiment. I\u2019m dropping subtle hints and seeing who jumps to conclusions about how irresponsible I am.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYour jokes are too complicated for me,\u201d Nie Huaisang pouts, which is rich coming from someone whose intricate gossip empire spans every engineering firm in the city. Wei Ying wants to place bets on when Nie Huaisang will actually figure it out and how he\u2019ll react, but the only person he has to bet with is Lan Zhan and that\u2019s no fun at all.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">***</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>After another month, Wei Ying stops feeling like he wants to sleep half the time and hurl the other half. \u00a0Instead, the nesting hormones kick in like crazy.</p>\n<p>He manages to suppress the instincts that tell him to go into Lan Zhan\u2019s room and rub his scent glands over every single thing Lan Zhan owns, though he does find himself wandering in occasionally and just standing in the middle of the room, letting his presence stamp itself in the air. He also manages to suppress the instincts that tell him that the only comfortable spot in the apartment is in Lan Zhan\u2019s lap, and that Lan Zhan should be spending the evenings running a comb through his hair.</p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t try to suppress the baby-related ones. \u201cI want to decorate the baby\u2019s room,\u201d he says. \u201cWe need to get a place with a baby\u2019s room.\u201d And then he stays up until four in the morning making sketches of bunny-filled meadows for a mural, until Lan Zhan gets up to go to the bathroom and catches him at it and gets all disapproving about sensible bedtimes.</p>\n<p>Wei Ying also blames the omega hormones for the fact that Lan Zhan being mad at him is equivalent to the apocalypse. He can\u2019t sleep, lies in bed feeling like something Lan Zhan would scrape off his shoe in disgust. The next morning he stumbles out of his room with his eyes red and swollen from crying. Lan Zhan takes one look and turns pale and apologises solidly for about half an hour. It\u2019s a mess.</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan makes up for it by finding them a gorgeous three bedroom apartment with a terrace which he <em>buys</em> because his family is even more fucking loaded than Wei Ying realised and his uncle (still living in blissful ignorance) is all like, <em>oh, a property investment? Good idea, here\u2019s the cash</em>.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s much more than Wei Ying deserves. Much more than he ever thought he\u2019d have. And though it\u2019s Lan Zhan\u2019s apartment, not his, Lan Zhan chose it with him in mind. Maybe it\u2019s another hormone thing, but Wei Ying has an urge to make it a home for <em>them.</em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">***</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>There are so many books to read.</p>\n<p>Baby psychology is fascinating. While Lan Zhan reads all the stuff about caring for a pregnant omega, pros and cons of different birthing strategies and establishing a routine for a newborn, Wei Ying reads about the developing brain, neural connections, how his baby will perceive and reason and learn.</p>\n<p>\u201cDid you know that early on, babies process language and music like they\u2019re the same thing?\u201d he tells Lan Zhan. \u201cHey, do you think if we only played to the baby instead of talking to it, it would learn to speak music?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat is nonsensical,\u201d says Lan Zhan from behind his mountain of books. \u201cAnd our baby is not a science project.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt seems a waste not to use it to test a few theories. One of the main problems in advancing child psychology is that most experiments would be unethical. But, like, if it\u2019s <em>our</em> kid\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWei Ying,\u201d sighs Lan Zhan. And then he says, \u201cWe should start looking at the local preschools.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got <em>months</em> before we need to do that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u201cWe do not. There are waiting lists. And I\u2019m emailing you a list of omega birthing classes. Let me know which you would prefer.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t seem fair that I have to go back to school for this,\u201d Wei Ying complains. \u201cYou\u2019ll come with me though, right?\u201d</p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t want to be the only omega without an alpha there. But he feels weird about it too. Lan Zhan won\u2019t want to spread their business around, he probably won\u2019t tell anyone they aren\u2019t mated. But everyone is going to look at Lan Zhan and think Wei Ying bagged the best alpha on the planet, and that makes him\u2026 uncomfortable.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">***</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jiang Yanli flies across the country to be there for the first big scan.</p>\n<p>\u201cA-Ying, your scent!\u201d she says, delighted, pressing her face into his neck and breathing him in.</p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t have much of a bump yet. Even in his summer t-shirts he just looks like he\u2019s put on a bit of weight. But he has been catching people at work taking a subtly deeper sniff on occasion, and a few days earlier a brisk silver-haired alpha with grandpa vibes had offered him a seat on the bus.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s so great having her there. She cooks for him, and helps him search for baby furniture, and squeals with him over tiny onesies. She is super nice to Lan Zhan too, which is actually slightly upsetting, because the converse is not true, in that Lan Huan is still treating the whole thing like he\u2019s holding his brother\u2019s hand and murmuring comfort while walking him to the gallows. Not that he\u2019s rude to Wei Ying, but he\u2019s not <em>nice.</em> He\u2019s not the warm, friendly presence he has always been before. He still clearly thinks the whole thing is a gigantic mistake.</p>\n<p>But if one older sibling is not on board, the other one is making up for it in spades. She\u2019s a rock at the scan. Wei Ying is nervous as fuck and he\u2019s not sure he\u2019s allowed to hold Lan Zhan\u2019s hand, so he clings to hers the whole time. She and Lan Zhan sit side by side on the guest chairs, and after the ultrasound technician says the baby is healthy she kisses Wei Ying\u2019s cheeks and strokes his hair and has tissues ready for him.</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan stares at the screen looking awed and painfully young.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">***</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI think we should name him Mochi,\u201d says Wei Ying, shoving a last bite of celebratory ice cream into his mouth.</p>\n<p>His sister laughs at him over her own dessert. \u201cI forbid you from giving him a joke name. That poor child will have enough to put up with.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI think we should name him Yuan,\u201d says Lan Zhan.</p>\n<p>Huh. Wei Ying had figured on irritating Lan Zhan with a bunch of terrible suggestions and arguing about a bunch of others, and not really making any decision until after the baby was born.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhich Yuan?\u201d he asks.</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan takes his hand and traces the character on his palm. Wei Ying twitches, half laughing. \u201cThat tickles.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSorry.\u201d</p>\n<p>He looks at his hand where the invisible character still burns. It\u2019s fitting. Yuan for sincerity, because he\u2019ll be Lan Zhan\u2019s son. Yuan for wishing, because Wei Ying wanted him so badly, <em>wants </em>him so badly, will do stupid, reckless things to keep him.</p>\n<p>\u201cLan Yuan,\u201d he says, trying it out.</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan blinks at him, looking momentarily stunned. \u201c<em>Wei</em> Yuan,\u201d he says.</p>\n<p>Wei Ying\u2019s cheeks heat. \u201cWei Yuan,\u201d he repeats. \u201cI like it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">***</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jiang Yanli leaves and Wei Ying is bereft, partly because he misses her and partly because he no longer has a distraction from an ever-increasing problem.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s read a lot of articles about increased libido in the second trimester. Most of them say, not in so many words, that he should take advantage, because pregnant sex is likely to feel awesome. Wei Ying can see that \u2013 he\u2019s sensitive everywhere, even trailing his fingers over his nipples gets him hot and bothered and the thought of Lan Zhan\u2019s mouth on them is overwhelming. But most of the articles assume he has a partner, not just a model-gorgeous roommate he\u2019s not allowed to touch, and none of them provide helpful hints on how to handle it when Lan Zhan, while chopping veggies for stir fry, slips a slice of carrot between his soft pink lips and hums in pleasure at the taste.</p>\n<p>Wei Ying is jerking off like he\u2019s going through puberty all over again, and it isn\u2019t even close to what he needs.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">***</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He kept the secret for longer than he expected to, but after the 18-week scan Wei Ying bites the bullet and tells his manager he\u2019s pregnant \u2013 which also means he might as well stop fucking with the rest of his office-mates. Nie Huaisang wails, \u201cI don\u2019t understand,\u201d for a solid minute before he gets around to offering congratulations. Wei Ying\u2019s other friends are baffled but accepting, in a <em>rather you than me </em>kind of way.</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan also decides it\u2019s time to come clean with his uncle. Lan Qiren avoids Wei Ying wherever possible, so they could probably have got all the way to the birth without him noticing, but apparently that\u2019s not on the table.</p>\n<p>\u201cUncle is very disappointed in me,\u201d says Lan Zhan, when he gets back from the conversation Wei Ying is incredibly glad not to have been part of. He doesn\u2019t look sad about it. He looks more like a quiet version of a righteous, vengeful god, keen for some smiting.</p>\n<p>\u201cHow did he take it?\u201d says Wei Ying. \u201cWhat did you tell him?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI told him that we are having a child together. And that we are not mated, nor do we plan to be.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d says Wei Ying. He swallows. \u201cI mean, he must have been pleased about that last part, right? At least he doesn\u2019t have to put up with me as a son-in-law.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe was not pleased about any of it,\u201d says Lan Zhan.</p>\n<p>\u201cIs he going to\u2026 uh, take the apartment away or something?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe apartment is mine. I negotiated the terms of the arrangement with this situation in mind.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wei Ying barks an astonished laugh, because wow, that\u2019s kind of cutthroat. Lan Zhan talked his uncle into straight-up <em>giving </em>him a ridiculously expensive apartment, knowing full well that he was about to piss the man off enough that he\u2019d snatch it back again if he possibly could? A thousand points for forward planning, negative one million for being a dutiful nephew, and it\u2019s very sexy that Lan Zhan doesn\u2019t seem to give a shit about the latter.</p>\n<p><em>Very</em> sexy, goddammit.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">***</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>They move into Lan Zhan\u2019s new apartment. <em>Our home</em>, Wei Ying\u2019s troublesome hormones insist. <em>Our family home.</em></p>\n<p>He\u2019s forbidden from helping, so he sits and watches Lan Zhan\u2019s biceps flex as he moves box after box and tries not to come in his pants.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">***</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Things come to a head \u2013 heh \u2013 when they\u2019re watching a movie together on a random Monday night. Wei Ying is wiped, because he still gets more tired than usual. Every work day drags, and also he\u2019d snapped at Ruby from payroll for trying to touch his ever-growing bump and then felt like a shit for doing it for the rest of the day.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s wiped, but he has Lan Zhan\u2019s fresh, warm scent all around him. He had to drape the blanket carefully over his lap before the intro sequence was even finished, and now he\u2019s so hard that he\u2019s squirming in his seat.</p>\n<p>\u201cWei Ying,\u201d say Lan Zhan, and when Wei Ying dares to glance sideways he finds Lan Zhan\u2019s gaze laser focused on him, heated but also somehow lost, uncertain and vulnerable. Lan Zhan\u2019s hand comes to rest over his heart, then strokes down over the swell of his belly, and Wei Ying chokes out a moan, desperate.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Please</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWei Ying,\u201d says Lan Zhan, his voice rumbling low in his chest, and then he\u2019s slipping down off the couch with liquid grace, pushing Wei Ying\u2019s legs apart and going to his knees between them. \u201cDo you want me to suck you?\u201d he says.</p>\n<p>Wei Ying can\u2019t manage a coherent response, but he can manage to frantically work his horrible pregnancy jeans out of the way, and then thread his fingers into Lan Zhan\u2019s hair and pull him down onto his cock.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s electric. It\u2019s <em>fast</em>, hits like a train all through him. He comes within minutes, pinching his own nipples, Lan Zhan\u2019s fingers moving roughly inside him, fucking up into Lan Zhan\u2019s hot mouth, crying out in glorious relief. It\u2019s so good, Lan Zhan smells <em>so good</em>, and he can barely catch his breath after, sobs and gasps until his body stops trembling with aftershocks and turns syrupy-sweet and heavy.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s drifting away. Vaguely he\u2019s aware that Lan Zhan didn\u2019t get off and he doesn\u2019t want to be that guy but he\u2019s so warm and so tired and everything feels amazing. He feels Lan Zhan cleaning him up and pulling him close. It\u2019s nice to be held. It\u2019s so good to rest his head on Lan Zhan\u2019s shoulder and sigh into his neck and breathe him in. The world blurs into disjointed fragments, then into dreams.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">***</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Apparently they\u2019re having sex now. At least, Wei Ying is. He\u2019s getting off, getting sucked and fingered and jerked off whenever he wanders up to Lan Zhan and whines that he\u2019s horny. When he tries to reciprocate, however, Lan Zhan gives him a look of gentle reproof and murmurs, \u201cNo need.\u201d</p>\n<p>So, Lan Zhan is doing him a favour. Wei Ying shouldn\u2019t be surprised. This whole thing is Lan Zhan doing him a gigantic favour, giving him the chance to have a baby when there\u2019s no practical way he could manage it on his own. When Lan Zhan has already turned his life upside down, what\u2019s a few blow jobs more or less? And if he doesn\u2019t want Wei Ying to touch him, Wei Ying is just going to have to respect that.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">***</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYour brother hates me,\u201d says Wei Ying, after they get back from a truly awkward brunch. \u201cThe legitimate contender for the title of the world\u2019s nicest human being straight up hates me.\u201d</p>\n<p>It sucks. The times he\u2019s felt like a shitty friend, like he\u2019s dragging Lan Zhan into trouble, dragging him down, there\u2019s always been the comfort that Lan Huan, inexplicably, is glad Wei Ying is in his little brother\u2019s life. Now that\u2019s all changed. The one person who has Lan Zhan\u2019s best interests completely at heart wants Wei Ying gone.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t hate you,\u201d says Lan Zhan.</p>\n<p>\u201cEvery time I touched you he looked like he wanted to drop-kick me into the river,\u201d Wei Ying says. \u201cHe hates me, Lan Zhan, he\u2019s not being fucking subtle about it.\u201d All the pregnancy hormones get him upset over the smallest things these days, but he thinks he\u2019d be pretty devastated even at his most resilient. There\u2019s nothing to do but have a good cry and maybe a nap and hope that when it\u2019s over he feels less like someone\u2019s dug out his insides with a spade. \u201cI\u2019m going to lie down,\u201d he says.</p>\n<p>\u201cWei Ying\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m fine. I don\u2019t care what he thinks of me. I\u2019m growing a person in here, I\u2019m tired,\u201d says Wei Ying, and bolts for his room.</p>\n<p>He muffles his sobs against the pillow, cries until he\u2019s damp and horribly dehydrated and somehow still desperately needs to pee. Which means he has to leave his goddamn room and it\u2019s going to be obvious to Lan Zhan that he\u2019s been bawling his eyes out.</p>\n<p>Whatever. It was probably obvious anyway.</p>\n<p>But Lan Zhan isn\u2019t out in the lounge, or in the kitchen. He\u2019s in his room, talking to someone, and he\u2019s angry. It\u2019s not the chilly contempt he usually projects when someone has pissed him off. It\u2019s raw and bleeding and hurt.</p>\n<p><em>Shit</em>, Wei Ying thinks, and presses his ear to the door.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou were rude. You were hostile. It\u2019s unacceptable. I will not have you upsetting him. You may think my choices are unwise, but they are <em>mine. </em>Not his.\u201d</p>\n<p>\n<em>Oh, shit.</em>\n</p>\n<p>The Lan brothers don\u2019t fight. Wei Ying has never so much as heard Lan Zhan speak sharply to his brother before. This is unknown territory, but he knows that if this whole situation ends up coming between the two of them he will never, ever forgive himself.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a pause, before Lan Zhan\u2019s voice snaps out again.</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course he noticed!\u201d</p>\n<p>More silence, broken by the slight scuff of bare feet as Lan Zhan paces.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat is not funny, brother.\u201d</p>\n<p>Another pause. Then Lan Zhan\u2019s breath gives a watery hitch, halfway to a laugh. \u201cAlright,\u201d he says, \u201cit is a little funny. But in most things he is very observant. Please. Please be kind.\u201d</p>\n<p>His voice is soft again. Like nothing is permanently broken.</p>\n<p>\u201cBrother,\u201d Lan Zhan begins, and then is cut off by something Wei Ying can\u2019t hear. After a few moments, gently, he says, \u201cThank you. I\u2019m sorry too.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wei Ying breathes a sigh of relief, and then his bladder twinges. He stops eavesdropping, out of necessity more than morality. When he pauses by Lan Zhan\u2019s door again on the way back to his room, water in hand and honestly ready for a nap, Lan Zhan is talking about baby things. Wei Ying can hear the smile in his voice when he says <em>A-Yuan</em>.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">***</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI need your cock, Lan Zhan. I need it in me. Want to feel you in me.\u201d</p>\n<p>It\u2019s not the first time. He\u2019s blurted it out before in the heat of things and Lan Zhan has always ignored it, but it\u2019s never felt so urgent, so necessary. He writhes on Lan Zhan\u2019s fingers, fucking himself back onto them, forward into his mouth, and it\u2019s good but it\u2019s not enough, he needs the hot length of Lan Zhan inside him, the weight of Lan Zhan\u2019s body pressing him down.</p>\n<p>\u201cNng, ah, I want your cock, I want you to fuck me.<em> More</em>. Please, please, please.\u201d He\u2019s sobbing with it, begging, shameless. \u201cI need you, I want you inside me, I want to feel you.\u201d Tugging frantically at Lan Zhan\u2019s shoulders. \u201cCome here, come up here, put it <em>in</em> me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan makes a throbbing growl that Wei Ying didn\u2019t know he <em>could </em>make, and then he\u2019s climbing on top, fumbling between them to get his cock out, awkward and clumsy until he sinks in with one smooth push and proceeds to <em>go the fuck to town</em>.</p>\n<p>Wei Ying makes a noise of mingled bliss and shock. He feels out of his body, floating on pleasure, barely connected to the physical sensation of Lan Zhan pounding into him. Distantly he can hear the noises he\u2019s making, and hear Lan Zhan groaning his name. Closer, more real, is the feel Lan Zhan\u2019s flushed skin under his fingertips as he cradles that beautiful, intent face in his hands, matches the rock of their bodies to curve forward so their mouths brush together.</p>\n<p>He comes like that, with Lan Zhan\u2019s mouth on his and Lan Zhan\u2019s cock thrusting into him at a frantic pace, vibrating all through him, and everything is oversensitive, almost painful but he doesn\u2019t care and Lan Zhan doesn\u2019t stop. <em>No manners</em>, Wei Ying thinks even as the pleasure starts its long, slow build to a second peak. He comes again, jerking his own cock and whining, when Lan Zhan\u2019s pace finally falters and he moans his release into Wei Ying\u2019s neck.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s a while before Wei Ying rouses himself enough to give Lan Zhan a shove. \u201cHeavy,\u201d he complains.</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan peels his eyes open, and his face goes worried. He rolls to one side and sits up, which wasn\u2019t the intended outcome at all. Wei Ying goes after him, gathering him close, trying to smooth the frown away with careful fingers.</p>\n<p>\u201cWas I too rough?\u201d asks Lan Zhan in a very small voice.</p>\n<p>\u201cNonono, you were good, sweetheart,\u201d Wei Ying babbles. He drops kisses everywhere on Lan Zhan\u2019s face and neck and even the sweaty collar of his shirt. \u201cYou were so good, you fucked me so good, holy shit.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan makes a noise of relief like he was really, honestly worried he broke Wei Ying with his dick, which \u2013 it\u2019s big, but it\u2019s not <em>that</em> big, Wei Ying has solid evidence that he can handle getting fucked by it for two days straight. Lan Zhan isn\u2019t usually so uncontrolled, even though the previous times they\u2019ve always had Wei Ying\u2019s heat scent to spur him on, but it\u2019s a change Wei Ying is not going to complain about.</p>\n<p>He kisses Lan Zhan a bit more, and they hang out and cuddle for a while, and then Wei Ying complains that he\u2019s sticky until Lan Zhan picks him up bodily and carries him into the shower.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">***</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>They don\u2019t talk about it. They probably should talk about it. But what\u2019s Wei Ying going to say? <em>I\u2019m glad you\u2019re getting off too now, but can you please go back to just blowing me so I don\u2019t accidentally fall in love with you</em>?</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan didn\u2019t sign up for that kind of bullshit.</p>\n<p>Still, Wei Ying thinks about it more than he used to.</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan is his best friend and they\u2019re having a baby together, and they\u2019re also having a lot of sex. He can\u2019t help but think about it.</p>\n<p>He\u2019ll always be a hyperactive loudmouth with authority issues, but he\u2019s going to have someone small and helpless depending on him very soon, and that means he\u2019s going to learn a bit of diplomacy if it kills him. And he\u2019s still going to make bad decisions, but with a baby at home he\u2019s much less likely to be wasted while doing it. Maybe he has the chance to grow into someone who wouldn\u2019t be a completely ridiculous prospect for a responsible person like Lan Zhan.</p>\n<p>And Lan Zhan will always be a fuddy-duddy who goes to bed at nine, but it\u2019s actually pretty nice to be around someone who wants nothing more than to make a healthy meal and play the guqin and maybe have some spectacular sex. Add to that the fact that Lan Zhan is obviously going to be a patient, loving, wonderful father, and it\u2019s not Wei Ying\u2019s fault that his emotions are getting\u2026 a little confused.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">***</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Ying\u2019s birthday is Halloween. It\u2019s the one night of the year he has absolute authority to drag Lan Zhan out with him and make him stay out past his bedtime. Lan Zhan has always submitted to it with good grace.</p>\n<p>He goes overboard with the costume. Full-on Morticia Addams, complete with a three-legged baby onesie on a pair of knitting needles. The makeup alone takes him nearly an hour, careful contouring and blood-red lips and epic eye shadow, and the dress is <em>killer</em>. He looks great.</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan is his Gomez, of course. Wei Ying puts him in the purple velvet smoking jacket outfit from the movie, ties up his hair so it looks slicked-back, and paints a moustache on him. The effect is hilarious. Scorching hot, because it\u2019s Lan Zhan, but mostly hilarious.</p>\n<p>The party is a good time, even if he can\u2019t drink. There\u2019s a chunk where everyone\u2019s trying to teach Lan Zhan quotes from the movies, and Wei Ying doesn\u2019t think Lan Zhan is going to be into it at all\u2026 but then he just goes for it, murmurs, \u201cCara mia,\u201d into Wei Ying\u2019s ear and kisses his wrist and up along his arm, all the way to his mouth while everyone cheers.</p>\n<p>So Wei Ying has a great night. And then it\u2019s over. He wakes up the next morning twenty-five years old, nearly seven months pregnant, and unlikely to get another real night out in a very long time.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">***</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The first trimester had its moments. The second ended up being kind of a blast. By the middle of the third, Wei Ying is officially no longer having fun.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s huge. He can\u2019t find a way to sit that doesn\u2019t press A-Yuan against his internal organs. His back aches all the time, and he has to pee every two minutes. A-Yuan\u2019s constantly kicking or getting tiny, adorable fits of hiccups that keep them both awake all night.</p>\n<p>As November turns into December, they have a run of grey, foggy weather. The mural in A-Yuan\u2019s room is half-finished, and Wei Ying can\u2019t look at all the little blank, blocked-in bunnies without wanting to cry.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s not ready. The crib is bought, the stroller is waiting, there are little onesies in the drawers and a changing mat set out, but the mural isn\u2019t ready.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou have time,\u201d says Lan Zhan, when he finds Wei Ying sitting helplessly on the floor in the middle of the room, paints untouched in front of him. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to do it today.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI want to get it done.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCan I help?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>No</em>,\u201d Wei Ying snaps. \u201cI don\u2019t need your help for everything. Just \u2013 fuck off and leave me to it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan goes. Wei Ying sits there feeling sick and useless and achy, until A-Yuan kicks him hard in the kidney.</p>\n<p>\u201cFucking <em>ow</em>,\u201d says Wei Ying, and then starts to laugh because that was pretty much exactly what he needed. \u201cOkay, okay, I hear you. I\u2019m doing it.\u201d He squeezes paint out of the tube, shuffles himself and his unwieldy belly into place, and starts work. One rabbit. He\u2019ll focus on one, and that will be better than nothing.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">***</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a month to go. Then two weeks. Then it\u2019s any day now. Wei Ying is off work, with nothing to do except call his sister and complain about how uncomfortable he is. He even calls Jiang Cheng, who tells him it\u2019s all his own fault and he should suck it up, and then asks how soon after the baby\u2019s born he\u2019s allowed to visit.</p>\n<p>The backache gets really bad. Wei Ying can\u2019t sleep. He gets up, one hand on the wall to steady himself, and goes to knock on Lan Zhan\u2019s door. \u201cSomething\u2019s happening,\u201d he says. \u201cI think. I don\u2019t know. I think?\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan comes out and sits with him, and things progress until Wei Ying is actually pretty sure, his body squeezing itself painfully into a new configuration for what\u2019s coming. So they call the hospital, and the midwife tells them it\u2019s time to come in.</p>\n<p>Wei Ying hangs up the phone and turns to Lan Zhan. \u201cTell me I\u2019ve got this,\u201d he says.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got this,\u201d says Lan Zhan, and he pulls Wei Ying close, warm with alpha scent, and kisses his mouth.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">***</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It doesn\u2019t hurt the way he thought it would. Not a helpless kind of pain. It\u2019s the pain of working insanely hard, pain like he\u2019s carrying the whole world on his back and taking a step forward, and another, and another, not stopping because if he does he\u2019ll be crushed. The pain of knowing there\u2019s a marathon to run, and he\u2019s given it everything and the finish line is still miles away. It\u2019s pain that he grits his teeth through and sets aside and gets the fuck on with things. He\u2019s never felt so focused in his life.</p>\n<p>There are people around him, nurses and doctors and Lan Zhan holding his hand, but he\u2019s not really aware of them. It\u2019s him and his body and A-Yuan. Bringing his baby into the world is the hardest thing he\u2019s ever faced, but the birthing classes knew what they were talking about. He knows what to expect, he knows what he has to do.</p>\n<p><em>I can</em>, he thinks. <em>I can</em>. And he does.</p>\n<p>He screams through the last of it, and then he\u2019s panting with shock at the crazy feeling of something so huge slithering out of his body. There\u2019s a cry and Wei Ying can\u2019t sit up, can\u2019t reach out, but he babbles, \u201cWhere is he? Where is he? Give him to me,\u201d and they place a tiny, flailing, puffy, perfect baby into his arms.</p>\n<p>Wei Ying stares down at him, and he thinks, <em>yes</em>.</p>\n<p>He spends an eternity admiring each tiny fingernail, each soft eyelash, the little wrinkles of skin at elbow and knee. Finally, he thinks to glance up to the person who\u2019s been there with him the whole time.</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan looks like someone hit him with a brick. His cheeks are wet.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s amazing, isn\u2019t he?\u201d says Wei Ying.</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan nods. \u201cYou\u2019re both amazing,\u201d he says.</p>\n<p>Honestly, Wei Ying agrees. He feels pretty badass.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s not quite done with labour, but he can do the whole placenta thing with A-Yuan cuddled up against him, mouthing sleepily at his nipples, tiny baby reflexes trying to figure out how to suckle. And then it really is over, and he\u2019s moved to a comfy, quiet room where he can sleep if he wants to, if he can bear to put A-Yuan down and close his eyes.</p>\n<p>\u201cCan I hold him?\u201d says Lan Zhan, all hopeful and quiet, and that\u2019s when Wei Ying realises that he\u2019s been a total baby-hog this entire time. He doesn\u2019t think he could bear to give A-Yuan to anyone else, but it\u2019s okay to let Lan Zhan take him. Lan Zhan is uncertain at first, but when A-Yuan settles against him he sighs out a whole world of tension. He cradles Wei Ying\u2019s baby like the most precious thing imaginable. Poor A-Yuan\u2019s fast asleep, exhausted by the scant first hours of his life. Wei Ying knows how he feels. He\u2019s more tired than he ever remembers being, but he lies there and watches while the minutes tick by and Lan Zhan whispers words of welcome to their son.</p>\n<p>\u201cLan Zhan?\u201d he says, in the dreamlike unreality of their little room.</p>\n<p>\u201cWei Ying?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI love you,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m in love with you.\u201d</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a pause. Wei Ying blinks drowsily, and finds Lan Zhan staring at him with an expression so still that, to Wei Ying\u2019s semi-focused brain, it\u2019s like there\u2019s nobody living behind his eyes.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re tired,\u201d says Lan Zhan.</p>\n<p>\u201cMm,\u201d says Wei Ying, and drifts off to sleep.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">***</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u00a0</p>\n<p>In the morning, he wishes he didn\u2019t remember. But he does, with far more clarity than he\u2019d felt at the time. He remembers saying it, and he remembers the out Lan Zhan gave him, the tacit request to pretend it didn\u2019t happen.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s probably for the best. He\u2019s just confused, his hormones have been heightened for months with an alpha in close proximity. He\u2019s feeling things that aren\u2019t real.</p>\n<p>Anyway, he\u2019s got A-Yuan, and that\u2019s what matters.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">***</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>They go home. They show A-Yuan the mural and watch his little face screw up as his eyes completely fail to focus. They put him in his crib for all of ten seconds before Wei Ying snatches him up again. They take him into Wei Ying\u2019s room, but it seems really impractical, because Wei Ying needs to crash and he needs Lan Zhan to take point. So they all three of them get settled in Lan Zhan\u2019s room instead.</p>\n<p>Wei Ying is tired and sore and bleeding, and he wants to just pass out for a week but instead the rest of the day is a blurred mess of fragments of sleep, in-between feeding A-Yuan, or changing him, or soothing him, or just obsessively watching him breathe. The night is the same. As is the next day, and the next, and by that point he\u2019s teetering on the edge of some kind of precipice.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">***</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Ying has very mixed feelings about Lan Huan, but they\u2019re stumbling around in a sea of disgusting laundry and takeout containers, one of them holding A-Yuan, the other one trying to hunt down a onesie that isn\u2019t covered in fluids, or take the used diapers to the trash, or eat dry cereal out of the box, but mostly just staring at the wall in a sleep-deprived haze. When Lan Zhan suggests, pitifully, \u201cMy brother could help,\u201d all Wei Ying can manage to say is \u201cOh God yes.\u201d</p>\n<p>So Lan Huan comes over and cooks and cleans and tidies, as is the way of his people. He sets a million loads of laundry running while holding A-Yuan nestled in the crook of his arm, because he\u2019s a superhuman multitasker. (\u201cHe has slept more than five hours in the past seventy-two, unlike either of us,\u201d Lan Zhan says, and then faceplants into the pillow.) He\u2019s only there for a day, but it\u2019s the day they need. Suddenly everything is no longer terrible. Suddenly they have energy. Suddenly Wei Ying remembers how awesome his son is, and goes from semi-breakdown to being ridiculously, joyously content.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">***</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jiang Cheng is pissy because Lan Huan got to see the baby first, just by dint of not living a thousand miles away, and has already proven his worth in the uncle department by being there when they needed him. The result is Jiang Cheng being aggressively attentive to Wei Ying\u2019s needs. It\u2019s bizarre and hilarious and Wei Ying is intrigued to see how far he can push it. Further than he thought, as it turns out. \u201cBrush my teeth for me, A-Cheng, my arms are too tired,\u201d is apparently Jiang Cheng\u2019s limit.</p>\n<p>The other limit is when Wei Ying, after some circumspect experimentation, manages to figure out how to press on the taut, swollen area around his nipples in just the right way that he can, when Jiang Cheng leans down to pass A-Yuan back to him, catch his brother full in the face with a jet of milk.</p>\n<p>A-Yuan almost gets dropped, Jiang Cheng threatens to break Wei Ying\u2019s legs, and Lan Zhan gives them both a look of livid fury and snatches A-Yuan away. Fortunately Jiang Yanli is there to smooth things over. She has a lot of practice at apologising for her brothers.</p>\n<p>As a side-effect, Wei Ying discovers that he can handle having Lan Zhan mad at him again.\u00a0 The pregnancy hormones are wearing off.</p>\n<p>Maybe soon he\u2019ll stop feeling like he\u2019s in love with more than just his son.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">***</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>They get two weeks of charmed life. Then Lan Zhan has to go back to work.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s miserable about it. He lingers by the front door in a cloud of distress scents, like he\u2019s battling against every instinct he has.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be late,\u201d says Wei Ying.</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan opens his mouth to say something, but then he snaps it shut again, makes a frustrated noise through his teeth, and frog-marches himself out of the door.</p>\n<p>Wei Ying\u2019s not really keen to be left alone, but at least he has plans. The health visitor is coming by, and then he and A-Yuan will take an experimental trip out in the stroller, just around the block so he can figure out if he can handle getting out of the house on his own. And then A-Yuan will nap, hopefully, and Wei Ying will collapse and die for a little bit.</p>\n<p>That\u2019s the general idea. But once he\u2019s actually alone, their bright apartment becomes a grim, chilly prison. The health visitor, when she arrives, is awful simply because she isn\u2019t Lan Zhan. She\u2019s kind enough, and she weighs and measures A-Yuan with gentle hands and pronounces him healthy, and checks over Wei Ying and pronounces him healthy too, but there\u2019s a slight frown on her face. \u201cYou know, it\u2019s really not recommended for your mate to leave you this soon,\u201d she says. And then she catches his eye, and glances at his file, and apologises. \u201cThe scent,\u201d she says sheepishly. \u201cI just assumed. I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019ll make a note.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wei Ying wants to scream.</p>\n<p>When she leaves, he finds he has three texts from Lan Zhan asking if he\u2019s okay. He sends back something soothing, because he\u2019s fine. He\u2019s fine. He is.</p>\n<p>They don\u2019t manage to get out of the house. Poor A-Yuan cries like he knows something is wrong. By the time he finally falls asleep, Wei Ying is only able to lie down with him and have a little crying fit of his own.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">***</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan gets home two hours earlier than expected. Wei Ying is in the middle of his millionth circuit of the room, helplessly bouncing his wailing baby, when Lan Zhan slams through the door and sweeps them both into his arms.</p>\n<p>\u201cWei Ying,\u201d he breathes. \u201cA-Yuan.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, thank god,\u201d says Wei Ying.</p>\n<p>They don\u2019t separate even to manoeuvre to the couch. They shuffle there mid-hug, and Wei Ying settles into Lan Zhan\u2019s lap. A-Yuan finally stops crying. Wei Ying strips his gross milk-stained t-shirt off to let him feed. Lan Zhan wraps all around him, as though worried he\u2019ll get cold.</p>\n<p>\u201cLet\u2019s never do that again,\u201d says Wei Ying, with more than a little bitterness, because they\u2019re going to do it again tomorrow.</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan shifts under him. \u201cIf we were mated I would be eligible to work from home,\u201d he says.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, it sucks.\u201d Wei Ying burrows his head against Lan Zhan\u2019s shoulder in a sulk. And then he catches the tone and says, \u201cWait, what?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI will lie,\u201d says Lan Zhan. \u201cIf I have your permission, I will tell my manager that the situation has changed.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019ll <em>lie</em>?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMm.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSeriously? You?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWei Ying, do not ask me to leave you again,\u201d says Lan Zhan, like he\u2019s close to tears, and wow, his day must have been even worse than theirs.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat about when they figure out it\u2019s not true?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI will explain my reasons and hope that my value to the company outweighs the deception. If it does not, I will find another job.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s crazy,\u201d says Wei Ying. \u201cFuck. Do it, go for it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">***</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Of course Lan Zhan had been perfectly ready to die on his hill of righteousness and demand that his uncle be the first to reach out, but it wouldn\u2019t have been fair to A-Yuan. Lan Qiren might be chilly and inflexible but he\u2019s the only grandparent-type figure their child is ever going to have. They\u2019ve already lost three sets of parents between them. So Wei Ying insists, even though he gives about even odds that it\u2019s all going to go to hell.</p>\n<p>\u201cWelcome, uncle,\u201d says Lan Zhan with icy politeness.</p>\n<p>\u201cA-Zhan,\u201d Lan Qiren says, not quite as frostily, and then he gives Wei Ying the faintest of nods before his eyes zero in on the baby. His fingers twitch.</p>\n<p>Wei Ying wants to laugh, it\u2019s so easy.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis is A-Yuan,\u201d he says. \u201cWould you like to hold him?\u201d</p>\n<p>He still doesn\u2019t get more than a nod. He doesn\u2019t get a smile, or a friendly word. But he does get the gratification of seeing how the old man melts when Lan Zhan takes the baby and passes him over.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s beautiful. He looks like you, A-Zhan,\u201d says Lan Qiren.</p>\n<p>Wei Ying manages not to chime in with, \u201cYeah, it turns out I guessed right about who the father is!\u201d because Lan Zhan starts radiating a quiet sort of satisfaction and he doesn\u2019t want to ruin it.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">***</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u00a0</p>\n<p>He keeps waiting for the other shoe to drop. For the last of the mess of hormones to finally flush themselves out of his body, and for his heart to discover that really, Lan Zhan is just his best friend who has done him an amazing list of favours.</p>\n<p>But time stretches on, and he thinks about it more and more. He thinks about how it might be if they actually were mates. He thinks of Lan Zhan\u2019s arms around him for <em>him, </em>not because they\u2019re new parents and their instincts are going nuts.</p>\n<p>He thinks of saying, \u201cI\u2019m in love with you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Then he thinks of Lan Zhan\u2019s face going still and blank, and he keeps his mouth shut.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">***</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>A-Yuan is perfect, of course, but he doesn\u2019t do a whole lot for the first weeks of his life. He waves his hands around, he wriggles and blinks, he yells his little heart out if he\u2019s not happy, but it\u2019s hard to know what he\u2019s reacting to. Wei Ying coos at him and makes faces, but can\u2019t tell if he actually likes it. He sings to him when he cries, but can\u2019t say if it\u2019s that or just time that eventually calms him down.</p>\n<p>And then there\u2019s a moment when Lan Zhan finally has the time and energy to sit down at his guqin. At the first notes, A-Yuan goes still in Wei Ying\u2019s arms, eyes wide. Then he starts grasping with his tiny fingers as though he could somehow reach out and bring the music closer.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh my god,\u201d says Wei Ying.</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan stops playing, concerned. A-Yuan freezes, and then his little face crumples and he <em>screams.</em></p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t stop!\u201d says Wei Ying. \u201cHe likes it. Shh, it\u2019s okay, A-Yuan, Papa\u2019s going to play for you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan obediently sets his hands back on the strings. A-Yuan quiets instantly, returning to his rapt attention, and Wei Ying carries him over so they can sit close by the instrument.</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you think he remembers?\u201d he said. \u201cHe must have heard it while he was inside me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d says Lan Zhan, and plays a beautiful, rippling run of notes that makes A-Yuan wriggle, lips shaping around little formless noises of his own.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey, you know what I told you about babies\u2019 brains and music?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s not a science experiment, Wei Ying.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">***</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSo,\u201d says Joe, one of the other omegas at the baby yoga group Wei Ying joined to stop himself going stir-crazy, \u201cthe <em>gorgeous </em>alpha who just dropped you off... that\u2019s Lan Zhan?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMm,\u201d says Wei Ying noncommittally, while raising A-Yuan\u2019s legs in the air and making a silly face. New parents are so bored they turn into worse gossips than Nie Huaisang. About three minutes into his first class, everyone knew he was unmated and living with his baby-daddy.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with him?\u201d says Joe, who Wei Ying is starting to no longer like. \u201cIs he a pervert? Why haven\u2019t you let him bite you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBecause I\u2019m chaste and virginal and nice omegas don\u2019t do that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou have a <em>baby</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cImmaculate conception,\u201d says Wei Ying. He coos at A-Yuan, \u201cWho\u2019s a beautiful second coming of Christ? You are!\u201d</p>\n<p>Joe, who has a fancy crucifix tattoo, picks up his kid from the mat and moves away.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">***</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>They move Lan Zhan\u2019s home office stuff into Wei Ying\u2019s room. Why not? It\u2019s not like Wei Ying is using it for anything except storing his clothes. And then, because it\u2019s inconvenient to walk in on Lan Zhan\u2019s conference calls when he needs a shirt that doesn\u2019t have spit-up on, they move the clothes into Lan Zhan\u2019s room too.</p>\n<p>Sometimes, in the middle of the night, Wei Ying lies listening to A-Yuan\u2019s snuffling snores, and has to reach out and touch a perfect, chubby, baby-soft cheek. They keep the bassinet on his side of the bed, close enough that he barely has to shift in Lan Zhan\u2019s arms to do it.</p>\n<p>He can\u2019t imagine moving back into the room that was once his own. He\u2019s beginning to feel like they <em>are</em> mated, in everything but the bite.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">***</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It happens when they ask Lan Huan to take A-Yuan out for a walk.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s the first time A-Yuan has been away from both of them. They plan for twenty minutes; five minutes to the park, ten minutes of hanging around, and then home again, provided A-Yuan doesn\u2019t wake up hungry and crying, in which case Lan Huan is under strict instructions to bring him straight back to be fed. Wei Ying is feeling very cool about it until the door closes with his baby <em>on the other side of it,</em> and then he has to fight off the urge to sprint down the street and wrestle the stroller out of Lan Huan\u2019s hands.</p>\n<p>\u201cFuck,\u201d he says, and turns to Lan Zhan for a hug.</p>\n<p>\u201cMm,\u201d Lan Zhan agrees, all twitchy and unsettled.</p>\n<p>They hold each other, finding what comfort and reassurance they can. Lan Zhan is warm and solid, and his fresh, sun-warmed scent begins to seep out from behind the overlay of tension. It\u2019s good. Wei Ying tilts his head to share a smile, and Lan Zhan leans in and kisses him.</p>\n<p>Wei Ying jerks back.</p>\n<p>They stare at each other.</p>\n<p>Wei Ying gives the most awkward laugh ever heard in this universe. \u201cShit,\u201d he says. And then he bolts into A-Yuan\u2019s room.</p>\n<p>He stands there, one hand pressed against his chest, the other braced on the changing table to keep his knees from buckling.</p>\n<p>They kiss all the time, affectionate pecks on the cheek or the forehead or even the lips, but it had been more than a peck. It was a <em>kiss</em>, the kind of kiss they haven\u2019t had since Wei Ying got too pregnant and grouchy to be interested in sex. It was a makeout kiss. And it turns out, that\u2019s a big problem. Because Wei Ying has made out with Lan Zhan a hundred times before, and it\u2019s never felt like having his heart torn out of his body and dragged over broken glass.</p>\n<p>He can\u2019t let Lan Zhan kiss him. He can\u2019t do that to himself. A-Yuan needs his heart unbroken.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">***</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Ying slopes back out into the lounge.</p>\n<p>\u201cUh,\u201d he says. \u201cSorry.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMy fault,\u201d says Lan Zhan. \u201cWei Ying, I overstepped. I forgot myself. It will not happen again.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s fine. It was nothing. I just\u2026 I don\u2019t think we should do that anymore.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p>\n<p>It\u2019s so awkward He\u2019s such an idiot.</p>\n<p>He sits on the couch and waits, watching the closed front door. He wants A-Yuan. He wants his baby in his arms. Lan Zhan comes to sit with him, not close, not touching. Silent.</p>\n<p>It takes <em>forever. </em>But finally the buzzer rings. As soon as the stroller is through the door, Wei Ying is crouching to get A-Yuan out. \u201cHe\u2019s hungry,\u201d he says, which is ridiculous because A-Yuan is still fast asleep. \u201cI\u2019m going to take him. You two \u2013 you should hang out. Have some bro time.\u201d And once again, he bolts.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">***</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>After three days of fake smiles and avoidance, Wei Ying decides he has to get it out in the open. Not because honesty is the moral choice \u2013 Lan Zhan already knows, he heard it and shut it down on the night A-Yuan was born \u2013 but because what he\u2019s doing, living so close to Lan Zhan and pretending he isn\u2019t affected by it, is going to kill him in the long term.</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan is the person whose help and advice he needs in a crisis, and this is definitely a crisis.</p>\n<p>He waits until A-Yuan is napping, eased into sleep with a guqin lullaby, and then he asks if they can talk. He sits them both down on the couch, a respectable distance apart, and takes a deep breath.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo I\u2019m in love with you,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd I know that\u2019s a problem. But we need to figure out how to fix it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan\u2019s face does something\u2026 strange.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou are not,\u201d he says.</p>\n<p>Wei Ying blinks. \u201cI am,\u201d he says. \u201cI love you. It\u2019s driving me crazy.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWei Ying. It\u2019s hormones. And A-Yuan.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wei Ying shakes his head, laughing painfully. \u201cIt\u2019s really not. I pretty much adore you. I <em>want</em> you. All the time. Believe me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan looks at him with that awful stillness, that nothingness behind his eyes. Deathly, horrible. \u201cHow can I?\u201d he says. And after another moment he drops his head, hiding his face in his hands.</p>\n<p>\u201cSweetheart,\u201d says Wei Ying helplessly. \u201cLan Zhan. Is it so terrible? I\u2019m not asking you for anything. I won\u2019t get in the way when you find someone you want to be with. And A-Yuan is ours. Equal partners. That won\u2019t ever change. I just need to find a way to manage where I don\u2019t tear myself apart pretending.\u201d He waits for some kind of response, but Lan Zhan is a fall of glossy hair, a taut curve of shoulder and back. Unmoving. \u201cLan Zhan? Please, can we just talk about it?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI have loved you for years. I can\u2019t bear to hear this and have it not be true.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wei Ying\u2019s mind goes blank. He stares, dumbfounded.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou are my world,\u201d says Lan Zhan. He raises his head. In his still face, his eyes burn. \u201cYou and A-Yuan. I would give you everything I am. But don\u2019t \u2013 don\u2019t ask me to believe you. You have just given birth to my child. Your emotions will be unsettled for a while, but they will go back to what they were before. You never wanted me in that way. Just \u2013 friendship and heats. I can give you that, but don\u2019t make me believe\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShit,\u201d says Wei Ying. Everything is turning upside down around him. He can\u2019t process it, there\u2019s too much. He reaches out, wraps both his hands around one of Lan Zhan\u2019s sturdy forearms and holds on. \u201cListen to me. I love you. I do, I love you, I swear.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWei Ying, <em>please.\u201d</em></p>\n<p>It sounds like anguish. Like all the pain he\u2019s been feeling, but magnified. How much pain has he caused this man who has asked nothing from him and given him everything? No wonder Lan Huan hates him. Step by step, and each one might have been designed specifically to torture. <em>Be my friend. Live with me. Satisfy me. Have a child with me.</em> He should never have asked. Would never have asked, if he\u2019d known.</p>\n<p>He is loved. Lan Zhan loves him. It\u2019s wonderful and appalling. \u201cYears? All this time? Why didn\u2019t you tell me?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI should have,\u201d says Lan Zhan, and his expression cracks. He hides his face again. \u201cBut you would have left me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">***</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m too little for this,\u201d says Wei Ying. \u201cI\u2019m only three years old. I can\u2019t handle it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jiang Yanli, on the other end of the video call, presses her lips together in sympathy. \u201dYou poor boys,\u201d she says. \u201cA-Ying, do you need me to fly out there?\u201d</p>\n<p>Wei Ying pouts. He wants her to. But it\u2019s a long trip, and it hasn\u2019t even been a month since her last visit. There are valid reasons to drag someone across the country, but <em>\u2018I really need a hug\u2019</em> isn\u2019t one of them.</p>\n<p>\u201cI need a way to convince him,\u201d says Wei Ying. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t believe me. It\u2019s so fucking stupid.\u201d He winces and drops an apologetic kiss on A-Yuan\u2019s head. \u201cSorry. Daddy will try to stop swearing, but right now Papa\u2018s driving him to it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou have been sending him some mixed messages,\u201d says Jiang Yanli.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m being clear <em>now</em>,\u201d says Wei Ying. \u201cI literally couldn\u2019t be any clearer. He doesn\u2019t want to hear it, he just goes all \u2013 fragile and sad, and I can\u2019t do that to him. I can\u2019t keep saying it. And god, Jiejie, you should see the way he looks at me, now he\u2019s not trying to hide it...\u201d</p>\n<p>If Lan Zhan had ever looked at him like that before, Wei Ying would not only have known, he\u2019d have fallen for him on the spot.</p>\n<p>\u201cI love him so much. And I want to strangle him and I want to punch myself,\u201d says Wei Ying.</p>\n<p>She chuckles gently. \u201cMaybe just give him some time before you try violence.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m terrible at waiting.\u201d He sniffles and wipes his eyes with his fingers, then his sleeve. A-Yuan, jostled, gives a whimper of protest. Wei Ying winces again, rocks him. \u201cShh, it\u2019s okay,\u201d he murmurs, but nope. Nope, Daddy fucked up. A-Yuan blinks his eyes open and starts wailing like a banshee<em>.</em> \u201cShit. I gotta go. Talk to you later.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGive A-Yuan a kiss from me,\u201d says Jiang Yanli. \u201cAnd tell Lan Zhan he can always call me if he wants to talk.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">***</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It sucks, having someone think he\u2019s an irrational, hormone-driven mess who doesn\u2019t know his own feelings. It especially sucks because for the past few months he <em>has</em> been an irrational, hormone-driven mess and he <em>didn\u2019t </em>know his own feelings. But he knows them now.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s always been drawn to Lan Zhan. He\u2019s been building inevitably towards love from the very beginning. His pregnancy just moved him a little faster along a path he\u2019d already been walking for years.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">***</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>A-Yuan gets sick.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s nothing serious, as it turns out. But because he\u2019s so small, so new, the risks are higher and the paediatrician is cautious. They spend two nights in the hospital. A-Yuan cries, weak and incessant, suffering, and there\u2019s nothing Wei Ying can do except be there, hold him, and hold Lan Zhan\u2019s hand to get through it. Lan Zhan is a rock. He asks all the right questions, he exudes calm. He makes it bearable.</p>\n<p>When they\u2019re finally allowed to go home, they load A-Yuan\u2019s car seat into Lan Huan\u2019s car and both cram into the back seat alongside it. As the car pulls out into the traffic, Lan Zhan leans his forehead against Wei Ying\u2019s shoulder and shudders with relief. Wei Ying whispers, \u201cI love you,\u201d and never even considers that he shouldn\u2019t.</p>\n<p>At home, they curl around one another on the couch. A-Yuan rests on Wei Ying\u2019s chest, and Lan Zhan\u2019s hand makes a blanket for his tiny body. They can both feel him breathing.</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you think I can find a way to put him back inside me?\u201d says Wei Ying. \u201cHe could grow up in there for another year or so. Nice and safe.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMm,\u201d says Lan Zhan. He sounds approving, but after a pause he adds, \u201cI would miss seeing his face.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe could install a window in my belly.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay,\u201d says Wei Ying. \u201cI\u2019ll get right on that.\u201d</p>\n<p>That night, the careful distance Lan Zhan has been maintaining vanishes. They\u2019re too raw, too tired. Wei Ying has no energy to pander to Lan Zhan\u2019s reservations and Lan Zhan, it seems, has no energy to put up protections around his own heart. So they kiss gently in the dark and fall asleep together, one of Wei Ying\u2019s hands resting in the bassinet, and Lan Zhan\u2019s hand cradling his elbow, making Wei Ying\u2019s arm an extension of his own.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">***</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Ying is done with Lan Zhan\u2019s issues. He\u2019s had enough.</p>\n<p>\u201cI know you don\u2019t like me,\u201d he tells Lan Huan, \u201cand I get it. But I need your help.\u201d</p>\n<p>He\u2019s probably got about thirty minutes to get this done. Then Lan Zhan\u2019s going to call and ask, over the sound of outraged shrieking, if he would please come home <em>now</em> because A-Yuan has decided that bottles are not acceptable today.</p>\n<p>Lan Huan tilts his head. He has a very assessing gaze. Gentle, but keen. He doesn\u2019t miss much. \u201cI like you, Wei Ying,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot to like about you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wei Ying wags a finger. \u201cThey say Lans don\u2019t lie, but your diplomacy is pure bullshit.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t like the way you use my brother,\u201d Lan Huan admits.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019m not crazy about that either. I didn\u2019t mean to!\u201d says Wei Ying, frustrated. \u201cI didn\u2019t know. And I don\u2019t want to do that anymore. I love him. I want to be his mate. He\u2019s told you that, right?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe told me that you said it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI mean it. And I need him to accept it and stop waiting for the day I come to my senses and walk away. It\u2019s not going to happen. He won\u2019t listen to me, but he listens to you.\u201d He\u2019s pacing, talking with his hands \u2013 something he\u2019s barely able to do anymore, because there\u2019s usually a baby in them.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy should I believe you, if he doesn\u2019t?\u201d says Lan Huan.</p>\n<p>\u201cBecause you can think about it rationally. Because I haven\u2019t spent years accidentally fucking up your emotions.\u201d</p>\n<p>There\u2019s that assessing look again. Wei Ying fidgets under it. Lans are so rigid, so keen to pass judgement. But Lan Huan is by far the most easy-going and flexible of the ones Wei Ying has met, and eventually he gives a slow nod.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll make tea,\u201d he says, \u201cand you can make your case.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">***</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He waits afterwards. He waits a week. It\u2019s a stressful week, because they\u2019re trying to figure whether it will be possible to put A-Yuan into daycare. A-Yuan is eleven weeks old, and they\u2019re still paranoid over him getting sick again, and Lan Zhan still hates being away from him for more than an hour or two at a time, is still determined to work from home as long as he can get away with it \u2013 but also, Wei Ying is going to go crazy with boredom if he doesn\u2019t get to go back to work soon. Part time. From home, if he has to. He needs to be doing something, creating things, using his mind.</p>\n<p>\u201cTry humming again,\u201d he says, crossing his arms over his chest. He has his wrap on, holding absorbent pads over his little swollen breast nubs, because A-Yuan crying makes him leak like a faucet and it\u2019s really gross.</p>\n<p>\u201cI have <em>tried</em> humming,\u201d says Lan Zhan tightly. He picks up the second nipple, the one Wei Ying has carefully pierced extra holes in, dips the tip in milk and swaps it out. \u201cYou need to not be here.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cJust give him to me for a bit. I\u2019ll get him started, then we can switch him to the bottle.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWei Ying.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s a strategy,\u201d says Wei Ying defensively.</p>\n<p>\u201cAn unsuccessful one, every time. Go into the bedroom.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wei Ying scowls, but he does it. He lies on his belly on the bed and listens to Lan Zhan\u2019s coaxing and A-Yuan\u2019s protests and grumbles and finally, silence. He sneaks back out. Lan Zhan, who has A-Yuan snuggled in his arms sucking away at the bottle, lowers his eyebrows and mouths <em>piss</em> <em>off</em>. It\u2019s adorable.</p>\n<p>Wei Ying goes to lie down again, and this time the quiet lulls him. He wakes to find Lan Zhan setting A-Yuan down in the bassinet beside him, sated and fast asleep. Lan Zhan crawls onto the bed with him and they lie side by side, staring up at the ceiling.</p>\n<p>\u201cSix months,\u201d says Lan Zhan out of nowhere.</p>\n<p>\u201cHuh?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSix months. If you still feel the same way.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wei Ying sits up, bouncing a little. His heart is hammering, his chest bubbling with excitement, because this is the closest he\u2019s got, the best sign that there\u2019s hope. But still, come <em>on</em>. \u201cSix months?\u201d he says, and then winces and lowers his voice. \u201cSix months? Seriously? Why?\u00a0 I\u2019m not going to change my mind!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cProve it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut\u2026 six <em>months</em>, Lan Zhan!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI waited for you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh my god,\u201d says Wei Ying. \u201cYou manipulative son of a bitch. How am I supposed to say no to that?\u201d He bounces again, in a little creak of bedsprings, and muses, absently scratching his nose as he thinks. \u201cSix months from when A-Yuan was born,\u201d he counters.</p>\n<p>\u201cHmm.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wei Ying beams. \u201cHis six month birthday.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI did not say yes.\u201d</p>\n<p>He didn\u2019t say no either. Wei Ying pounces on him and presses kisses to his forehead and cheeks.</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan pushes him off. \u201cWei Ying! Six months means <em>not yet</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat wasn\u2019t couple-type kissing. That was just because you\u2019re the cutest.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019ll wake A-Yuan,\u201d says Lan Zhan, thoroughly exasperated.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">***</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It isn\u2019t six months. There\u2019s no finish line to cross. Instead, it\u2019s a gradual thing. Lan Zhan still flinches to hear \u2018I love you,\u2019 but he starts to say it. His body language subtly shifts sometimes, when they\u2019re out, his shoulders square and he positions himself at Wei Ying\u2019s shoulder when Wei Ying chats to a cashier in the grocery store or stops to speak to another parent in the park. There\u2019s still not much in their lives that isn\u2019t about A-Yuan, but they start him in daycare three mornings a week and that means Lan Zhan can take an early lunchbreak and they can eat together and talk \u2013 and talking sometimes means flirting, a low simmer of heat between them. Then there\u2019s the evening when they\u2019re watching mindless TV and Lan Zhan shifts his arm so his wrist lies against Wei Ying's neck, his scent-gland pressed against the point where a mating bite would be. Wei Ying goes hot all over, forgets how tired he is, overwhelmed by the need to bare himself under Lan Zhan, throat exposed\u2026 but he doesn\u2019t, he can\u2019t, <em>not yet</em>.</p>\n<p>It happens again, and this time Lan Zhan slides his hand down into Wei Ying\u2019s lap.</p>\n<p>It happens again, and Lan Zhan climbs on top of him, presses into him and, with no ceremony whatsoever, bites down.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou asshole,\u201d says Wei Ying afterwards, blissed out and laughing with pure happiness. \u201cNot even flowers, Lan Zhan? Not even dinner?\u201d His neck is stinging and tingling, spreading warmth through every part of him.</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan rumbles satisfaction deep in his chest. \u201cFelt like the time,\u201d he says.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s <em>been</em> time,\u201d says Wei Ying, and grabs his hand, guiding it back down between his legs to start on round two. Except that\u2019s when A-Yuan\u2019s unmistakeable <em>I\u2019m hungry </em>cry emanates from the bedroom. \u201c<em>Fuck</em>. Is there milk in the fridge? You have to do it, I can\u2019t feed him with your come dripping out of me.\u201d</p>\n<p>They peel apart. Lan Zhan, after a perfunctory clean-up, goes to feed the baby. Wei Ying takes a little more time, but he doesn\u2019t shower, doesn\u2019t want to wash away the scent of it just yet. Then he goes into the bedroom, where Lan Zhan is propped against the pillows, cradling A-Yuan. He goes to sit with them, and A-Yuan looks up at him and abandons sucking to beam and coo and giggle. Wei Ying beams back, makes faces at him, and murmurs, \u201cOh my god, why? Why is he so awake, he\u2019s going to be up for fucking hours.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t swear in front of him.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, alpha,\u201d says Wei Ying sweetly, and when Lan Zhan turns an utterly incredulous face to him he cracks up.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>No</em>,\u201d says Lan Zhan.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou bit me,\u201d says Wei Ying, sticking out his tongue. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to deal with me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan smiles. \u201cForever,\u201d he says, and wraps his arm around Wei Ying, pulling him close.</p>"
