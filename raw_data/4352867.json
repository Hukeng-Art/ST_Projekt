  "text": "<p>\n<em>Yook Taesun is just an ordinary man. He works a steady job in a pretty office building, and goes on dates that his mother sets up for him. He is happy with his life.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>-</em>\n</p>\n<p>Min Yoongi is one of the Korean film industry\u2019s biggest stars.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s been acting ever since he was a young teenager, starting off as \u2018younger protagonist\u2019 or \u2018neighborhood child\u2019 in weekly dramas. Of course, his stubbornness had refused to let it end there. When he finally had managed to score the lead in a deeply thoughtful, artistic piece about a blind piano prodigy\u2014a critically acclaimed success\u2014it had won him the BIFF Actor of the Year award. It had cemented his place as one of the best actors in the business.</p>\n<p>And Yoongi\u2019s already bored of it all.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s bored of his face on all the magazine covers.\u00a0 He\u2019s tired of variety shows praising his \u201cunorthodox looks\u201d and \u201ckawaii tsundere vibe.\u201d (He\u2019s not even sure what the second one means, since it\u2019s in Japanese and he\u2019s never bothered to look it up.) He\u2019s tired of being offered awards and certificates and honors because he\u2019s <em>not</em> honored by any of it. Yoongi knows that it\u2019s all just a show to try to get his attention, to get his sponsorships, to get a piece of his fame. He\u2019s tired, jaded, and so, so bored.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis one has Kim Saeron casted as the female lead.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yoongi\u2019s been tuning his manager out for a while, but he\u2019s forced to pay attention when Hoseok slaps his cheek lightly.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey, this cheek is insured for like 7 billion won,\u201d Yoongi complains, rubbing at his face roughly to try to get the red mark he knows is there to dissipate faster. Hoseok only snorts at him, and Yoongi wonders where the days back in the beginning of his career when Hoseok used to actually dote on him like a normal manager went.</p>\n<p>\u201cEven if I did get your face insured, it wouldn\u2019t be worth that much,\u201d Hoseok scoffs. \u201cNow, like I was saying,\u201d he continues, but Yoongi\u2019s had enough of it.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not acting with Kim Saeron,\u201d Yoongi interrupts harshly, ripping the script out of Hoseok\u2019s hands and tossing it onto the steadily-growing pile of rejected screenplays on the floor. \u201cShe\u2019s like 14, I\u2019d feel so gross trying to act with her. Imagine if she was your sister or someone!\u201d</p>\n<p>Hoseok makes a face. \u201cDon\u2019t pull the sister card on me, I\u2019d never let you even look at her.\u201d He looks down at the rejected script sadly. \u201cThat probably would have been a hit, you know. She\u2019s getting big after she did <em>Hi! School Love On</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yoongi exhales loudly through his nose, which Hoseok interprets as a sign to let the topic die. He rifles through his bag before pulling out another stapled packet. Yoongi sighs internally. They do this at least twice a week, shuffling through the dozens of screenplays mailed to his P.O box. Hoseok\u2019s always rigorous, and never allows Yoongi to skip over even the lowest-budgeted, straight-to-video films, because his philosophy is to always search for the diamond in the rough. Yoongi thinks his philosophy is horse shit.</p>\n<p>(\u201cYou were a diamond in the rough once, you know.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShut up.\u201d)</p>\n<p>\u201cHow about this one? It has Park Shinhye,\u201d Hoseok suggests, waving a script in front of Yoongi\u2019s face. The actor ignores Hoseok\u2019s waggling eyebrows and takes the script, glossing over it before tossing it to the ground with the other. No, he doesn\u2019t feel like acting in another overplayed love story. He\u2019s tired of pretending to be a fool in love.</p>\n<p>Hoseok frowns, \u201cShe even called you her ideal type, you know. You could at least consider it a little longer. She\u2019s a big star these days. She could really help you make another big hit.\u201d And Yoongi hates that, hates the way Hoseok suggests he needs some co-star\u2019s help in making a movie a success because Hoseok, as his manager, is supposed to be on Yoongi\u2019s side, not suggest that Yoongi needs to team up with the latest hot actress to make himself more <em>marketable</em>. He\u2019s an actor, not a prostitute.</p>\n<p>Yoongi just wants something different.</p>\n<p>\u201cAm I picking movies just based off of which pretty face they cast now?\u201d Yoongi asks sourly, crossing his arms over his chest. \u201cWhat happened to me picking movies that I actually liked? Or should I give up on that and just switch over to hosting variety shows?\u201d</p>\n<p>Hoseok looks chagrined, but no less determined as he spreads out the stack of scripts across Yoongi\u2019s coffee table. \u201cListen, I\u2019m sorry I can\u2019t offer you the role that you\u2019re looking for, but it\u2019ll come, okay? Until then, just pick the role you hate the least.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yoongi heaves out a sigh and leans back against his patent leather sofa, rubbing at his eyes. It\u2019s wrong to get snappy with Hoseok; it\u2019s not like he writes the scripts. In the end, Hoseok, just like Yoongi, is only trying to make a living, and he\u2019s glad that for some reason, Hoseok\u2019s stuck around for this long even though Yoongi\u2019s well aware that he can be a brat at times. All the time.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll choose something,\u201d Yoongi mumbles, dropping his hands from his face only after his vision\u2019s gone thoroughly blurry. Hoseok smiles thinly, nodding once, and then gets up and heads out, his hand going to the Bluetooth headpiece that\u2019s ever-present on his ear. Yoongi stares at Hoseok\u2019s retreating back and wonders if it\u2019s possible for managers to ever take vacation days.</p>\n<p>But he\u2019s just a little too selfish for that, since Yoongi would be lost without Hoseok.</p>\n<p>Sometimes he wonders why he\u2019d ever agreed to be an actor in the first place when he\u2019s so obviously bad at interacting with other people. But then again, Yoongi thinks, when you don\u2019t know how to be human, you should at least pretend. And that\u2019s what acting is.</p>\n<p>-</p>\n<p>\n<em>Yook Taesun works as a photojournalist for a local newspaper. Photography is his only passion in life. He\u2019s happy with his life, he thinks, but he would be happier if he could one day make it big in the newspaper. He wants to be known, to be heard. That\u2019s his dream.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>-</em>\n</p>\n<p>Yoongi hates getting fan letters. He hates how girls send him perfumed pink notes, sometimes decorated with their nail polish or favorite markers or, god forbid, <em>tears</em>. Even back when he was a dumb teenager, Yoongi had never cared about anyone enough to send them handwritten notes and little gifts.</p>\n<p>He wonders why the teenagers of today don\u2019t have anything better to waste their time on.</p>\n<p>Yoongi would have long ago abandoned opening his fan mail if Hoseok hadn\u2019t insisted that it was only polite to acknowledge his fans. And while Yoongi may be an asshole, he isn\u2019t a rude asshole, and so every other day at noon he slips on his sunglasses and face mask and makes the long journey from his comfy condominium in Cheongdamdong to his P.O box.</p>\n<p>And even though he tries his best to remain discreet, he\u2019s still surrounded by a shrieking crowd of fans the minute he exits the post office.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, yes, thank you,\u201d Yoongi murmurs quietly, accepting a small box of chocolates from a young girl who looks so nervous that Yoongi\u2019s scared for her blood pressure. He puts it in his jacket pocket, and then turns to bow to all the fans standing behind him.</p>\n<p>So maybe he hates fan mail, but he can\u2019t hate his fans. He doesn\u2019t really understand how other famous stars go on interviews and profess their undying love towards their fans, since Yoongi really has to strong feelings about them either way. But he knows he\u2019s supposed to be kind and gracious and lovely. That\u2019s what\u2019s expected of him, so that\u2019s what Yoongi will deliver.</p>\n<p>Acting is all about pretending to feel, after all.</p>\n<p>\u201cThank you all for coming to see me,\u201d Yoongi speaks up a bit more to address the crowd, squinting his eyes against the blinding glare of dozens of cameras. \u201cI have to go now, but perhaps I\u2019ll see you later, hmm?\u201d</p>\n<p>The words cause loud squealing to erupt from the group, and Yoongi forces his smile even wider to fight against the urge to cover his ears. He nods his head one last time in farewell before quickly slipping into the waiting taxi.</p>\n<p>Hoseok\u2019s grinning at him from the backseat, and Yoongi feels the sudden urge to punch him in the mouth.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re always so sweet to your fangirls,\u201d Hoseok coos, and Yoongi sits on his hands so he can\u2019t do anything harmful with them. Hoseok pulls the stack of envelopes off of Yoongi\u2019s lap before flipping through them carefully, not even skimming over a single letter. A plain manila envelope apparently catches his attention, and Yoongi watches as his manager peers at it in confusion.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d Yoongi asks, his curiosity getting the better of him. Hoseok looks at the contents of the envelope quickly.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s a script sent to you from Kim Namjoon,\u201d Hoseok replies, flipping through the packet.</p>\n<p>Yoongi doesn\u2019t recognize the name, and it\u2019s a little unusual for novice producers or bargain-busters to try to get Yoongi to feature in their films. \u201cWho is that?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cRemember <em>Silent Forest</em> from last year?\u201d</p>\n<p>Of course Yoongi remembers it. There\u2019s probably not a soul in Korea that hasn\u2019t watched <em>Silent Forest</em> at least twice. It had taken the media world by storm, a melancholy half-horror-half-romantic piece about a depressed woman and her dead lover, and had been nominated for nearly every award there was. It quite possibly had been, Yoongi has to admit, a masterpiece.</p>\n<p>\u201cKim Namjoon directed it,\u201d Hoseok says again, narrowing his eyes as he scans through the script. Yoongi\u2019s immediately intrigued.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat, so he sent me a screenplay? Me personally?\u201d Yoongi hates to say it, but he\u2019s honestly excited. Kim Namjoon\u2019s movie had been outside the realm of traditional blockbusters, and Yoongi had secretly envied the lead actor in it because he had gotten to do something different than boring romance-action-thriller plots assigned the rest of them.</p>\n<p>Hoseok nods, and then Yoongi leans over and grabs the script out of his hands. He skims over the first page and introduction, and then wrinkles his nose.</p>\n<p>\u201dIt\u2019s called <em>Banchan</em>? Side dishes?\u201d Yoongi mutters, running the pad of his finger over the embossed letters on the front of the packet. \u2018Side dishes\u2019 doesn\u2019t sound particularly inspiring, but Yoongi has no reason to doubt Kim Namjoon yet.</p>\n<p>He reads over the beginning lines of the script\u2014boring as all movies are, really\u2014and then flips straight to the end. Certain words jump out at him, \u2018death\u2019 and \u2018love\u2019 and suddenly \u2018boyfriend,\u2019 and that\u2019s when Yoongi realizes that this movie is not a typical girl-meets-boy type of story.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s about two men?\u201d Yoongi raises his eyes to meet Hoseok\u2019s own doubtful ones, and then he looks back down at the script to make sure he\u2019s not misunderstanding anything.</p>\n<p>\u201cFrom what I\u2019ve heard through the grapevine,\u201d Hoseok begins, fidgeting a little in his seat, \u201c<em>Banchan</em> is about two ordinary men discovering extraordinary love. Or something like that. I don\u2019t know, I\u2019ve just heard some whispers here and there.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yoongi doesn\u2019t move his gaze from the script, and Hoseok gnaws on the nail of his thumb.</p>\n<p>\u201cA lot of actors refuse to do something like this,\u201d Hoseok continues, watching Yoongi\u2019s face for any sign of a reaction. \u201cIt\u2019s still really a very touchy subject these days, you know? It probably will get more bad attention than good, honestly, so I\u2019ll completely support you and it\u2019s totally fine if you decide not to\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI want it,\u201d Yoongi breathes, stopping Hoseok in his tracks. Yoongi clutches the script tightly in his hands and looks up at Hoseok with a growing sense of excitement. It\u2019s something he hasn\u2019t felt in a long time, and it scares him a little, how badly he wants to feel more of it.</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d Hoseok looks uncertain and sounds even more so. \u201cReally, it\u2019s going to be difficult. You\u2019re going to have to act closely with another man. You should think about this some more. Also, you\u2019re throwing Park Shinhye away for some indie film.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t care,\u201d Yoongi says adamantly, holding the script a little closer to him. \u201cDon\u2019t you see? This is <em>perfect.</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>-</p>\n<p>\n<em>There\u2019s nothing Taesun hates more than the feeling of being in a rut. His life is just one big rut, really, and he hates it so much he wants to die. So when he finds an unexpected chance to escape that rut, he takes it.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>-</em>\n</p>\n<p>Yoongi gets the role.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s no surprise, really, since Min Yoongi is a household name, and every director worth their salt knows that signing Yoongi onto a movie is practically a guarantee for good rating. Kim Namjoon is probably a little more desperate than most to have a good name associated with his rather risky movie, and so Yoongi glosses by the audition process with little more than a glance at the script.</p>\n<p>The only thing that remains is to find his co-star.</p>\n<p>Namjoon is a nice enough guy, and he\u2019s younger than Yoongi so he doesn\u2019t try to talk down at him like some other directors do. (Or maybe that\u2019s because Namjoon\u2019s still a relative newbie in the field despite his success in the past, and Yoongi\u2019s so famous he has his face on every carton of banana milk.)</p>\n<p>Namjoon\u2019s willing enough to give into some of Yoongi\u2019s demands\u2014like no washing out the color in his scenes because his skin\u2019s light enough and he doesn\u2019t want to look like a ghost, dammit\u2014but he\u2019s adamant about having the other male lead be an unknown actor rather than someone as famous as Yoongi, because he doesn\u2019t want his movie to be supported only by the fame of its stars.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt needs to be heard for its story, you know?\u201d Namjoon says, gesturing wildly. \u201cAnd I think you\u2019re the key to drawing people in, Yoongi-ssi. But can you imagine this movie with two Min Yoongis? I think people would then start to lose focus on the actual story.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yoongi is more than okay with that stipulation, but he\u2019s not sure if it\u2019s because he genuinely agrees with Namjoon or if it\u2019s because he\u2019s selfish and doesn\u2019t want to share the spotlight with another popular face. It\u2019s probably both.</p>\n<p>Before Namjoon selects a second male lead for the movie, he introduces Yoongi to Kim Seokjin, who apparently is the writer of the screenplay. Kim Seokjin is tall, well-proportioned, and handsome enough to be an actor himself, but Yoongi can tell that he prefers to be behind the camera and not in front of it from his shy demeanor and soft voice.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s not Seokjin\u2019s first screenplay, Yoongi soon discovers. He\u2019s more than just a little shocked to find out that Seokjin was also the creative mind behind <em>Silent Forest</em> as well, because never would he have imagined that such a happy face was capable of thinking up such a serious script. But then again, this is the movie industry, and Yoongi knows better than others that nothing is as it seems.</p>\n<p>Through Seokjin, Yoongi finds himself understanding the story of <em>Banchan</em> better. It\u2019s a rather simple story, really, and nothing unrealistically dramatic happens to the two main characters at all.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s the story of how a man named Taesun tries to find his own story to tell,\u201d Seokjin explains, eyes flashing, \u201cand along the way, he happens to find Sooha. Really, it\u2019s a very simple story about love and work and family\u2014things that all people experience. I don\u2019t want this to be some adventurous and silly commentary about the lives of men who love other men, you know? It\u2019s more to show that all people are only human. I think a lot of us have yet to understand that.\u201d</p>\n<p>When it\u2019s put that way, Yoongi has to agree.</p>\n<p>Seokjin is unusually prominent in all of the discussions regarding <em>Banchan</em>, considering that most writers of at least all the films Yoongi\u2019s been in have been content to sit back and let others deal with the process of animating their words. Seokjin treats the script like it\u2019s his child, regarding it with a fierce sort of pride and love, and Yoongi can appreciate that because anybody who loves something to that extent has to be invested in it. Yoongi\u2019s always invested in all of his roles, and he\u2019s glad to meet someone that treats their job with the same kind of fervor.</p>\n<p>So whereas Yoongi is expecting Seokjin to attend the second wave of auditions, he\u2019s not expecting it when Namjoon asks Yoongi to come as well.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s the person who\u2019s going to be acting by your side for the next two months, right?\u201d Namjoon says, his wide smile dimpling his face. Yoongi has certainly worked with less friendly directors before.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou should have a say in this too.\u201d</p>\n<p>And that is a new thing even for someone as experienced as Yoongi, so he nods yes and agrees to sit at the end of the judging table during auditions for the part of Taesun\u2019s lover.</p>\n<p>The first wave of auditions is thoroughly unimpressive. Each new actor walks in, stares a little nervously at Yoongi and Namjoon, and then reads off a few scenes from the script. They\u2019re all jittery, too focused on getting all the words completely correct that they forget to focus on the meanings behind them. They\u2019re uninspired and <em>boring</em>, Yoongi thinks bitterly, and he mentally prepares himself to work with one of these dimwits. Namjoon, though, is apparently not ready to settle, and kindly dismisses all the actors before shutting the door to the audition room.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe can\u2019t use any of them,\u201d Namjoon laments, sinking down to the ground. Seokjin, still in his seat, shrugs his shoulders.</p>\n<p>\u201cAren\u2019t there more waiting to be auditioned?\u201d</p>\n<p>Namjoon looks tense, and Yoongi can practically read his thoughts. There aren\u2019t many more waiting for their auditions; there might even be none left at all. There aren\u2019t many actors at Yoongi\u2019s level that are willing to work in such a movie with such risky themes, let alone rookie actors that are eager to jeopardize their careers before they\u2019ve even started. Seokjin is bright-eyed and hopeful, and Yoongi finds him to be such a breath of fresh air in such a jaded industry that he can\u2019t bring himself to say what he knows both he and Namjoon are thinking.</p>\n<p>A sudden knocking at the door startles all three of them, and Namjoon opens the door just a sliver to see a dark-haired boy standing hunched over in the doorway, hands braced on his knees as he pants a little.</p>\n<p>Namjoon opens the door wider, and Yoongi watches as the boy looks up and then hastily bows three times in quick succession, his waist bending the full ninety degrees every time. Yoongi can\u2019t tell if it\u2019s hero worship or just extra-politeness anymore. The boy\u2019s clutching a script, and as Yoongi catches his first proper glimpse of his face he\u2019s struck by how <em>young</em> the boy looks. Yoongi knows that Namjoon had put out a word for rookie actors, but this kid looks like he\u2019s straight out of cram school, not acting school. He\u2019s got wide, drooping eyes and a thick-lipped smile and Yoongi finds his uncommon features oddly refreshing.</p>\n<p>\u201cMy name is Park Jimin?\u201d The boy phrases it like a question. He seems to notice his nervous faux pas and quickly clears his throat to try to cover it up. Namjoon suppresses a smile, but Seokjin outright laughs. Park Jimin\u2019s ears tinge red, but he continues speaking.</p>\n<p>\u201cI was told that you\u2019re currently auditioning actors for the part of Sung Sooha?\u201d Jimin asks a little more confidently, swiveling his head between Namjoon, Seokjin, and Yoongi as if he\u2019s not sure who to focus on. Namjoon turns and shoots Yoongi a worried look, one that he can understand. Auditions had begun an hour ago, which means Jimin is <em>late</em>. And a late actor means late filming, which means a late premier, and Yoongi is painfully aware that having a late premier is only a small step away from having no premier.</p>\n<p>But still, they really do need someone to fill Sooha\u2019s role quickly, so Yoongi nods at Namjoon and watches carefully as Jimin cheerfully walks into the room.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019d like to read the scene where Sooha comes across his dead mother,\u201d Jimin says, looking at Namjoon for the nod of approval. Yoongi\u2019s by no means memorized the entire script yet, but he\u2019s well aware of the passage Jimin wants to perform. Not many of the people that had auditioned earlier had attempted this particular scene, in which Sooha returns home and comes across the dead body of his mother in her bed. It\u2019s ultimately the turning point for his character, and the script just reads <em>[Sooha returns home and is shocked to see the body of his mother],</em> and so every single auditionee had approached the scene with variations of crocodile tears and loud emotions.</p>\n<p>That\u2019s why Yoongi is surprised when Jimin suddenly drops to his knees, and is silent.</p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t make any noises, but the wide set of his eyes and the trembling of his hands is more than enough to set the mood. Jimin reaches out slowly, eyes fixed on some horrible sight in front of him that only he can see, and the quiet hitch of his breath seems deafeningly loud in the silence of the room.</p>\n<p>\u201cUmma,\u201d Jimin whispers, his face crumpling slowly as he bites at his lip. He turns his head down, and while Yoongi can\u2019t see his face anymore, he can see teardrops hit the ground, and he\u2019s secretly impressed because realistic fake crying is something that Yoongi has a hard time with even now.</p>\n<p>\u201cI shouldn\u2019t have\u2026\u201d Jimin speaks, his voice wavering just enough to seem genuine, \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have told you about us, right?\u201d</p>\n<p>He smiles, then, slow and sweet and sad and Yoongi takes a moment to glance in surprise at Namjoon because no other auditionee had <em>smiled</em> in this scene, and Jimin\u2019s method is unconventional enough that Yoongi can\u2019t tell if he\u2019s brilliant or plain crazy. Jimin reaches out carefully and then pulls back again, rubbing at his cheek.</p>\n<p>\u201cI should have kept quiet,\u201d Jimin mumbles, pulling his knees up. His smile wavers, and then breaks into something terribly, terribly sad. \u201cMaybe then you would have been alright.\u201d</p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t say anymore, doesn\u2019t even finish the rest of the scripted lines because he\u2019s too busy trying to keep down his sobs, gasping in deep breaths of air.</p>\n<p>And then it\u2019s suddenly over, and Jimin\u2019s standing up and bowing and smiling brightly as if he hadn\u2019t just been playing the part of an unexpectedly-orphaned boy just a few seconds ago.</p>\n<p>\u201cUh, that was really all that I memorized,\u201d Jimin laughs nervously, rubbing at the back of his neck. \u201cI\u2019m sorry it was so short. If you want, I\u2019ll also improvise another section?\u201d</p>\n<p>Namjoon shakes his head, and Jimin suddenly looks terrified. Yoongi sighs as he prepares himself to see yet another young hopeful get rejected. Jimin had been better than most, yes, but the role of Sooha requires a little something extra, and honestly, Yoongi doesn\u2019t know how Namjoon expects a complete newbie to be able to fill the role of the second male lead for this\u2014</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re hired!\u201d Namjoon exclaims, breaking Yoongi out of his thoughts. Yoongi gapes at him.</p>\n<p>Jimin\u2019s mouth falls open as well, and he clasps his hands together gleefully. \u201cReally? Oh my gosh, thank you!\u201d</p>\n<p>He darts forward and pulls a pen out from his pocket, and then scribbles his name and number down on an extra copy of the script which he hands over to Namjoon. \u201cThank you again, really, this means everything to me! Here is my contact information, you can call me to let me know when you have dates and timings fixed! I\u2019m really sorry, I have to leave now or my manager\u2019s going to beat my ass, but really, thank you!\u201d</p>\n<p>And then Park Jimin is gone, and Yoongi still hasn\u2019t shut his mouth. Namjoon and Seokjin are both staring at him, twin grins on their expectant faces as they wait for his opinion, and then Yoongi simply shakes his head and says, \u201cWhat the <em>fuck.</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>-</p>\n<p>\n<em>Sung Sooha works at his mother\u2019s family-style restaurant. He\u2019s a good cook, and he loves his mother, and he\u2019s happy to help her out, but he\u2019s terribly bored with his life. He meets Taesun because he eats at the restaurant regularly. Taesun likes the side dishes. Sooha likes Taesun.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>-</em>\n</p>\n<p>Filming starts a month later, and Yoongi and Hoseok make the long drive down from Seoul to Daegu. The streets feel familiar, and Yoongi thinks that maybe the familiarity of them must be the \u201chomesickness\u201d he\u2019s often heard about. He thinks about visiting his mother, but then remembers that she\u2019s at the vacation house on Jeju Island that Yoongi had bought for her two years ago.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt must be nice being back here, huh?\u201d Hoseok asks, showing off his patent sunny smile. \u201cMaybe we can go have a night out on the town?\u201d</p>\n<p>Yoongi, as expected, scoffs and tells Hoseok to go alone, and then goes and locks himself in his bedroom until the first day of filming.</p>\n<p>Yoongi always has a ritual for the first day.</p>\n<p>He wakes up at five in the morning, just to ensure that he can take his time puttering around his Daegu condo and getting ready slowly. He always eats a cup of yogurt and tries to leave it at that, but then Hoseok always shows up at six in the morning and forces Yoongi to eat an entire pancake breakfast because according to Hoseok, pancakes can prepare a grown man for anything.</p>\n<p>Yoongi\u2019s grumpy just as he always is, because out of all the days of filming, the first one is always the hardest.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s the one where the crew is the most enthusiastic and cheerful and happy, and nothing grates on Yoongi\u2019s nerves more than <em>happy</em>.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re like a vampire or something, I swear you never smile,\u201d Hoseok mutters, trying to fix Yoongi\u2019s hair so that it looks like anything other than a bird\u2019s nest.</p>\n<p>\u201cVampires don\u2019t <em>sleep</em>, not smile,\u201d Yoongi replies, swatting his manager\u2019s hands away from his face. \u201cStop messing with my hair, it doesn\u2019t matter what it looks like because the coordis will just fix it anyway. Can we go now?\u201d</p>\n<p>And Hoseok knows that it\u2019s useless to argue with Yoongi, so they arrive at the set with Yoongi\u2019s hair in complete disarray. The coordis let out a collective sigh, but everyone in the industry is aware of Yoongi\u2019s less-than-cheerful disposition and they\u2019re all too afraid to comment on his appearance.</p>\n<p>\u201cYoongi!\u201d</p>\n<p>Seokjin is the only one who dares to approach Yoongi this early in the morning, and even though Yoongi doesn\u2019t mind Seokjin\u2019s company, his blindingly bright smile just pisses him off more.</p>\n<p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it exciting?\u201d Seokjin marvels, sitting down in the chair next to Yoongi\u2019s. It\u2019s marked \u2018Director,\u2019 but Namjoon is nowhere to be found yet and Yoongi has the feeling he wouldn\u2019t mind Seokjin stealing it anyway.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, super exciting,\u201d Yoongi mumbles, hoping that Seokjin will be able to hear the lack of enthusiasm in his voice and get the memo to back off. He doesn\u2019t, sadly.</p>\n<p>\u201cI love seeing everyone get ready to film,\u201d Seokjin continues, looking around the set in excitement. \u201cAt first I didn\u2019t know that there was so much that went into making a movie. It all seems so simple, but actually it\u2019s a lot of work. Although, I guess you\u2019d know more than I do, with all your experience and all.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yoongi shoots him a tired look. \u201cYeah. It\u2019s a lot of work, and the first day is always the most work.\u201d</p>\n<p>He\u2019s saved from having to talk more when there\u2019s a big commotion at the coordi station, and Yoongi peers over to see that Park Jimin has finally arrived.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy are you all wet?\u201d a senior coordi squeals, rubbing at Jimin\u2019s head roughly with a towel. \u201cNow it\u2019ll take extra time for us to dry and style you!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSorry, sorry,\u201d Jimin mumbles, reaching up to help the coordi dry his hair. \u201cIt\u2019s raining outside, and I didn\u2019t have an umbrella on me.\u201d</p>\n<p>The coordi tuts at him, \u201cShouldn\u2019t your manager take care of you better?\u201d</p>\n<p>That\u2019s when Yoongi notices the sullen-looking man standing next to him, scrolling through his smartphone. He looks up and frowns, and Yoongi thinks that this must be Jimin\u2019s manager\u2014and somehow, he looks even younger than Jimin.</p>\n<p>There are too many children in the film industry these days, Yoongi scoffs internally.</p>\n<p>\u201cMaybe if Jimin would stop running off, I could follow him around with an umbrella,\u201d the manager remarks dryly, jabbing the corner of his clipboard into Jimin\u2019s side. Yoongi mentally thanks god that Hoseok is far more easy-going (although maybe that\u2019s because Yoongi can be mean enough for the both of them).</p>\n<p>Jimin doesn\u2019t seem to mind the rough treatment too much, though, and turns to sling a friendly arm around his manager\u2019s neck. Yoongi vaguely thinks that Jimin would probably be good friends with Hoseok.</p>\n<p>Yoongi doesn\u2019t get to see Jimin anymore before he\u2019s whisked off to hair and makeup, and the costuming coordis manage to dress him in no less than seven different outfits before he finally snaps violently enough to have one intern run off the set in tears. Hoseok shoots him a pained look, but doesn\u2019t say anything.</p>\n<p>Yoongi does have a bit of a reputation. He\u2019s notoriously fussy, not easily satisfied, and he doesn\u2019t smile much. The media thinks it\u2019s because he\u2019s a tortured soul, Hoseok thinks it\u2019s because he\u2019s secretly depressed, and only Yoongi knows that he\u2019s the way he is because he just can\u2019t bring himself to care. He hasn\u2019t cared about anything in a long time, not about himself, others, his career. The only things Yoongi cares about are the characters he plays.</p>\n<p>At least they care about other things.</p>\n<p>-</p>\n<p>\n<em>Taesun only knows Sooha as the man who runs the restaurant. He\u2019s nothing more, nothing less. It\u2019s not until Taesun nearly gets fired from his job and storms into the restaurant after closing hours that he gets a chance to properly talk to Sooha. He\u2019s much different than he had imagined.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>-</em>\n</p>\n<p>Yoongi doesn\u2019t know why he\u2019s an actor when he hates every single part about the film industry.</p>\n<p>He hates the multiple takes required to get the perfect shot because Yoongi\u2019s positive he had it right the first time, regardless of what Namjoon thinks. He doesn\u2019t like the plain-Jane actresses hired to play Taesun\u2019s coworkers because they\u2019re boring, fawning over Yoongi not because they enjoy his acting, but because they enjoy his face. He absolutely hates how Park Jimin loves the film industry.</p>\n<p>They don\u2019t shoot many scenes together, not yet, because Taesun doesn\u2019t properly meet Sooha until after the big fiasco at the newspaper, and so Yoongi won\u2019t get a chance to act with Jimin until a few days later.</p>\n<p>Yoongi stays back after his own scenes to watch Jimin though, because he is a little intrigued after watching Jimin\u2019s impressive audition.</p>\n<p>The character of Sooha is one filled with deep regrets and sadness. He works long hours at the restaurant and goes home to take care of his ailing mother at night, and he\u2019s torn between the pain of liking Taesun and the need to hide that fact from the world. He matches none of the cheer and enthusiasm that Yoongi\u2019s come to associate with Jimin.</p>\n<p>But Jimin\u2019s a better actor than Yoongi had originally thought, and the way he seamlessly transitions is something Yoongi\u2019s a little envious of, since Yoongi always struggles to keep his character and his own persona separate.</p>\n<p>Yoongi doesn\u2019t stick around for long because he needs to go and rehearse his own lines on his own, so he taps Hoseok\u2019s shoulder to let him know that he\u2019s leaving and then heads off to his trailer. He locks the door behind him and collapses onto the twin bed, letting out a muffled groan into his pillow to try to release some of his frustration.</p>\n<p>Acting is always hard work, and as much as Yoongi enjoys this role, it exhausts him. Yoongi channels all of himself into playing Taesun. He\u2019s always like this, always feels too much for his characters, always empathizes with every fiber of his being until sometimes he can\u2019t tell who Min Yoongi is anymore. Hoseok had once advised him to try yoga but Yoongi barely has time to sleep, let alone meditate for hours.</p>\n<p>Someone knocks on the door to his trailer, and Yoongi contemplates throwing a fit before getting up and answering it.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s Jimin.</p>\n<p>\u201cHello, Yoongi-ssi,\u201d Jimin says cheerfully, striding into Yoongi\u2019s trailer like it\u2019s his own. \u201cJust wanted to introduce myself. Isn\u2019t it weird that we\u2019re going to be playing lovers and we haven\u2019t even had a proper conversation yet?\u201d</p>\n<p>He\u2019s smiling innocently, and Yoongi wonders if it\u2019s not too late to drop the movie because if there\u2019s one thing that Yoongi absolutely hates working with, it\u2019s too-cheerful co-stars.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe don\u2019t need to have a conversation,\u201d Yoongi deadpans, shutting the door because it appears that Jimin has no intention to leave. \u201cOnly our characters do.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin pulls a face. \u201cWhat kind of attitude is that? I don\u2019t think our characters will turn out very well if we hardly know each other ourselves, right?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cA real actor can make any character seem convincing,\u201d Yoongi parrots the words of his old acting coach, sending Jimin a withering glare.</p>\n<p>Jimin shrugs. \u201cMaybe I\u2019m not a real actor yet, then. Oh well. They say practice makes perfect, you know?\u201d</p>\n<p>Yoongi stares at Jimin\u2019s enthusiastic face and thinks that he hates it.</p>\n<p>-</p>\n<p>\n<em>The minute Taesun meets Sooha, he doesn\u2019t like him. He can\u2019t understand why anyone would give up college, his dreams, his life to run a shabby old restaurant.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>The minute Sooha meets Taesun, he falls in love.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u00a0</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Taesun is not good at being a normal person. He\u2019s shy and awkward and doesn\u2019t like being around others. He\u2019s too judgmental and talks too fast and has a nervous tic where he tugs at the hair on the back of his head. Sooha finds him utterly charming.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>-</em>\n</p>\n<p>Apparently Yoongi is the only person in the entire world who\u2019s not immediately smitten with Park Jimin.</p>\n<p>In the few short weeks since filming\u2019s started, Jimin had managed to make friends with everyone from Namjoon and Seokjin to all the coordi noonas. Yoongi had even heard the shy intern in charge of buying coffee and sandwiches gushing about \u201cJimin oppa\u201d to her friends over the phone.</p>\n<p>Even now, when they should be filming, Jimin\u2019s off talking to the bright-haired chief cameraman off to the side, gesturing wildly with his hands as the other man laughs loudly. Yoongi squints, trying to remember his name. Tae-something.</p>\n<p>\u201cAlright, we\u2019ll roll it again?\u201d Namjoon calls out loudly, and although he\u2019s polite enough to phrase it as a question, everyone understands that it\u2019s really an order. Yoongi cracks his shoulders\u2014Hoseok sends him a grossed-out look\u2014before returning to the set, settling down at the fake restaurant booth. Jimin waves goodbye to the cameraman before following after Yoongi, taking his place by Yoongi\u2019s side.</p>\n<p>They\u2019re filming the scene where Taesun finally shows off some of his favorite photographs to Sooha. It\u2019s not emotionally difficult and Yoongi knows it\u2019s supposed to be simple, but something about being forced to sit in such close quarters with Jimin makes it hard to focus on getting his lines right.</p>\n<p>\u201cAction!\u201d Namjoon calls out, and Yoongi waits until the familiar <em>clack</em> of the clapperboard signals him to begin.</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t normally show these to many people,\u201d Yoongi says, instinctively dropping his voice to the lower register he\u2019s decided to use for Taesun. \u201cSo consider yourself privileged.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin\u2014as Sooha\u2014snorts, wiping his hands on the small dish towel stuffed into his pocket before sitting down across from Yoongi. \u201cYes, yes, I\u2019m very lucky.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yoongi slides over the few old prop polaroids Namjoon\u2019s snagged from various crew members. Jimin looks over them carefully, and Yoongi catches himself staring for just a little too long at how Jimin\u2019s tongue darts out to wet his lips.</p>\n<p>No, not Jimin. Sooha. This is all Sooha, and Yoongi is Taesun. There\u2019s a difference. (Although, Yoongi mentally decides that Taesun is definitely attracted to Sooha. Not Yoongi, Taesun.)</p>\n<p>\u201cI like this one the most,\u201d Jimin says, pointing to a photo of who\u2019s actually the head coordi\u2019s grandmother. \u201cShe reminds me of my mother, a little. She\u2019s very beautiful, you\u2019ve done a good job in capturing that.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yoongi coughs a little, willing his ears to turn red because Taesun\u2019s supposed turn shy at the praise. \u201cWell, older people have a lot more time to become beautiful, you know?\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin smiles widely, leaning forward across the table, and this time it\u2019s all Yoongi that makes his eyes widen.</p>\n<p>\u201cSometimes some people are just born beautiful, I think,\u201d Jimin says, pinning Yoongi down with his stare, his mouth open just slightly, and suddenly Yoongi can\u2019t remember his next lines so he blurts out, \u201cI think you\u2019re full of shit.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCut!\u201d a voice calls out, and Yoongi leans back and throws his arms over his head in frustration. The line was supposed to be \u2018I think you\u2019re just trying to get on my good side\u2019 but somehow Yoongi\u2019s potty mouth had gotten the better of him.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Yoongi says, standing up to face Namjoon, and he\u2019s surprised to see Seokjin sitting in the director\u2019s chair instead.</p>\n<p>\u201cActually, I liked that,\u201d Seokjin says, smiling gently. He looks good, sitting gracefully in the chair with one long leg folded over the other, and Yoongi finds himself wondering again why Seokjin doesn\u2019t just act himself.</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t think Taesun is the type to always be so polite about everything,\u201d Seokjin continues, waving a hand dismissively at the confused intern who\u2019s frantically pointing at the flubbed line in the script. \u201cIf you ever feel like changing a line a bit, Yoongi-ssi, just say it and we\u2019ll see how it works, okay? After all, I doubt a few cuss words would really impact this movie much, hmm?\u201d</p>\n<p>Yoongi nods dumbly, because yeah, that\u2019s a little new to him, but he doesn\u2019t fight it since polite writers are a blessing in the film industry.</p>\n<p>Yoongi hears the clapperboard go off again and turns back to face Jimin. The little glint of amusement in Jimin\u2019s eyes makes Yoongi want to jump out a window, but he grits his teeth and then continues with the script as usual.</p>\n<p>-</p>\n<p>\n<em>They start by having lunch together. That turns into having dinner together. And then into Taesun simply stopping by to say hi. It\u2019s not like he wants to like Sooha, he just can\u2019t help himself. Sooha is captivating, and it\u2019s been so long since anything\u2019s captivated Taesun.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>-</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m so tired,\u201d Jimin whines, turning his head to look at Yoongi. They\u2019re relaxing after a long day of filming, sitting with their heads tipped back as their hair gets a fresh coat of dye applied. Yoongi wants to block out Jimin, he really does, but it\u2019s hard when the younger is sitting literally right next to him.</p>\n<p>And even though Yoongi\u2019s tried his absolute best to ignore Jimin whenever they aren\u2019t in character, he realizes that for some reason Jimin\u2019s taken a liking to him. This time, Yoongi thinks, it feels a little different than dealing with just another starstruck fan, since Jimin doesn\u2019t fawn over Yoongi like everyone else does.</p>\n<p>No, Jimin\u2019s different. He always waves to Yoongi when he leaves, always compliments him after a tough scene, always hands him a thermos of ginseng tea every morning because \u201cTaehyung\u2019s mom says it\u2019s good to build up your strength, and you\u2019ve been looking a little pale, hyung\u201d (to which Yoongi grumpily replies \u201cno, that\u2019s just my skin, you idiot,\u201d but he always drinks the tea anyway).</p>\n<p>\u201cThen rest,\u201d Yoongi bites out, shutting his eyes stubbornly so he doesn\u2019t have to look at Jimin\u2019s hurt puppy expression. \u00a0He\u2019s seen it enough, considering that Yoongi isn\u2019t always the most polite with words.</p>\n<p>\u201cHow am I supposed to rest? I have to go home and run lines with my manager. I should probably exercise a little too, I\u2019ve been slacking recently.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yoongi opens his eyes just in time to catch Jimin raising his shirt critically, displaying a chiseled abdomen that makes Yoongi\u2019s mouth go a little dry. (And no, that doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s attracted to Jimin, definitely not. But now he\u2019s thinking about when he was in secondary school and kissed another boy behind the sports shed for the first and last time in his life and maybe Jimin\u2019s abs are something the 15-year-old Yoongi would have liked.)</p>\n<p>\u201cShut up,\u201d Yoongi coughs, turning his eyes back onto his phone quickly. \u201cYou\u2019re such a gym rat, I bet. I\u2019ve even caught you doing pushups with your manager one day.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin laughs, and it sounds so pleasant that Yoongi feels the urge to get up and leave since he <em>hates</em> pleasant things. \u201cYeah, my manager is pretty strict about staying healthy. But he\u2019s not a fanatic or anything, he\u2019s just making sure I don\u2019t get too lazy.\u201d</p>\n<p>And Yoongi holds back a snort like that, because if Hoseok was ever to try to get Yoongi to be less lazy, Yoongi would probably take back the motorcycle he bought Hoseok on his last birthday.</p>\n<p>\u201cYour manager seems to be pretty strict, though,\u201d Yoongi replies conversationally, thinking back to all the times he\u2019s seen Jimin\u2019s manager snapping at him or wagging a finger. \u201cYou must be patient for putting up with him.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAh,\u201d Jimin laughs again, rubbing at his arms, \u201creally, he\u2019s not so bad. Actually, Jungkookie and I grew up together in Busan, so we\u2019re good friends even though he\u2019s younger than me. When I moved to Seoul halfway through college he demanded to come with me. He\u2019s always been the pushy type, you know?\u201d</p>\n<p>And no, Yoongi doesn\u2019t know, and he can\u2019t really see the stern Jeon Jungkook as a \u2018Jungkookie\u2019 either.</p>\n<p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know that,\u201d Yoongi says quietly, looking over to the corner of the salon where Hoseok\u2019s gleefully antagonizing Jungkook. Jungkook looks like he\u2019s tired of it, yes, but the more Yoongi looks the more he realizes that Jungkook doesn\u2019t necessarily lookmean either.</p>\n<p>A slight tap on his head prompts Yoongi to tip his head back obediently as the coordi noona starts to wash the brown dye out of his hair. Jimin\u2019s hair\u2019s been dyed an even deeper shade of black than it already is, and Yoongi briefly thinks that the contrast looks good against his smooth skin and bright eyes.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s a good kid,\u201d Jimin interrupts Yoongi\u2019s thoughts quietly, smiling to himself. \u201cActually, he\u2019s a good actor too. Way better than me, at least. I keep telling him to give it a shot, but he\u2019s just so shy. I hope that being involved as my manager at least will open some more doors for him. I know he can do a lot better than be the manager to some third-rate newbie.\u201d</p>\n<p>And the self-deprecating tone in Jimin\u2019s voice makes Yoongi frown, although he\u2019s not sure why since it\u2019s not like they\u2019re friends or anything. Maybe Yoongi just doesn\u2019t like hearing anyone sell themselves short.</p>\n<p>But he never gets the chance to say anything because suddenly Seokjin appears and calls out to Jimin, who flashes Yoongi one last easy smile before gets up and leaves, his hair still wet.</p>\n<p>The coordi starts toweling Yoongi\u2019s hair dry, and even when the towel covers his vision he can still see Jimin\u2019s smile plastered to the backs of his eyelids.</p>\n<p>-</p>\n<p>\n<em>One day, Sooha confides to Taesun that it would be his dream to go to culinary school, and then maybe transform his simple restaurant into something great. He can\u2019t though, since he needs to take care of his sick mother and run the restaurant and earn money and pay the bills. Taesun thinks that Sooha\u2019s life is unfair, and wonders why it makes his own heart hurt.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>-</em>\n</p>\n<p>Namjoon\u2019s a man with connections, and somehow \u2018connections\u2019 means a fully-stocked buffet bar for lunch every day.</p>\n<p>Yoongi\u2019s not complaining of course, since he\u2019s a fan of meat and all the side dishes available. Sometimes he wonders if Namjoon had purposely ordered only the best side dishes to be served at the filming of a movie named <em>Banchan</em>.</p>\n<p>But it irks him that even though the side dishes are good, they\u2019re all that Jimin will eat.</p>\n<p>\u201cWill you stop eating like a literal bird?\u201d Yoongi asks in exasperation, watching as Jimin drops his chopsticks when he\u2019s startled. Yoongi ignores how Jimin\u2019s eyes go wider than normal and instead focuses on Jimin\u2019s small plate. There\u2019s a helping of pickled radishes and a sad stack of lettuce, and that\u2019s it.</p>\n<p>The thought of Jimin putting his body through so much to prepare for this role, the idea of him growing thinner and pale and sickly makes Yoongi\u2019s heart drop into his stomach, and he doesn\u2019t know why.</p>\n<p>\u201cGod, you\u2019re sad,\u201d Yoongi mutters, immediately dumping half his serving of fried chicken onto Jimin\u2019s plate. \u201cThere\u2019s all this good food available and you\u2019re eating pickled radishes? Without any rice too? Are you an alien or something?\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin\u2019s obviously flustered, his mouth opening and closing uselessly as Yoongi continues to fill his plate.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m trying to diet,\u201d Jimin says weakly, looking down at his now-full plate miserably. \u201cThis stuff really isn\u2019t good for me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou piss me off so much,\u201d Yoongi says truthfully, ignoring the way Jimin frowns in hurt. \u201cSeriously, how am I supposed to act next to a guy who barely eats? It\u2019s depressing. What if you faint on set? I\u2019d be so embarrassed.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yoongi wants to slap himself because he\u2019s being meaner than he intended, but it\u2019s better than grabbing Jimin by the shoulders and shaking him around and shouting at him to take better care of himself. <em>Because Yoongi cares about Jimin</em>.</p>\n<p>\u00a0Somehow, Jimin must possess some sixth sense of intuition because he catches the real meaning behind Yoongi\u2019s words and perks up again.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re so nice, hyung,\u201d Jimin beams at him, and Yoongi narrows his eyes because it\u2019s the first time Jimin\u2019s called him that and he\u2019s not sure how he\u2019s supposed to feel about it. How do normal people deal with too-attractive, extra-cute co-stars?</p>\n<p>\u201cShut up and eat,\u201d Yoongi says, deciding that when in doubt, being rude works best. Jimin doesn\u2019t look hurt by the words, though, and takes a bite of the chicken. Yoongi watches him for a while to make sure he finishes at least two pieces (and boy, when Jimin eats he <em>eats</em>).</p>\n<p>He finishes his own meal and mumbles a quick goodbye to Jimin who\u2019s still eating, and tries to make his voice sound as unfriendly as possible because he doesn\u2019t want Jimin to think they\u2019re friends or anything, since they\u2019re <em>not</em>.</p>\n<p>Yoongi meets up with Hoseok at the exit of the studios, a bit taken aback at the mischievous expression he can see on his manager\u2019s face.</p>\n<p>\u201cI saw that,\u201d Hoseok says, grinning widely. \u201cYou totally like him. Oh my god, I never thought I\u2019d say those words before. I should journal about this.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShut up,\u201d Yoongi scowls, reaching out to punch Hoseok\u2019s arm. \u201cYou know I hate him.\u201d</p>\n<p>Hoseok snorts. \u201cOh yeah, you hate him enough to share your food with him and tell him to eat properly. Okay.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yoongi gets into the car and frowns to himself, pondering over Hoseok\u2019s words. So what if he was concerned for Jimin? If he was to be unhealthy, then that could possibly delay the filming. And that would be bad for Yoongi, so really Yoongi\u2019s just looking out for himself.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou can think what you want,\u201d Yoongi says quietly, settling into the passenger seat as Hoseok fires up the engines, \u201cbut I don\u2019t like him. I don\u2019t like anybody.\u201d</p>\n<p>Hoseok doesn\u2019t try to disagree anymore, but the teasing smile on his face still makes Yoongi angry.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey Yoongi, you still like me, right?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI tolerate you.\u201d</p>\n<p>-</p>\n<p>\n<em>When Taesun falls in love with Sooha, it\u2019s not like fireworks going off. It\u2019s not like a bomb exploding. It\u2019s quiet and soft and feels like falling into bed after a long day\u2019s work. When Taesun thinks back about it, he realizes that maybe he was in love with Sooha all along.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>-</em>\n</p>\n<p>They only have two weeks of filming left, but Yoongi knows that they\u2019ll be the hardest to get through. Namjoon\u2019s insisted on filming all of the easy scenes first, all of the scenes involving all of the characters except Yoongi\u2019s and Jimin\u2019s. Jimin had filmed Sooha\u2019s mother\u2019s death scene just a few days ago, and afterwards he had been so drained that Namjoon had given him a day off in sympathy.</p>\n<p>Yoongi\u2019s still the most impressed by Jimin\u2019s acting in that scene, but he\u2019ll never tell Jimin that.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m going to head to my trailer,\u201d Yoongi murmurs tiredly to Hoseok quietly. They\u2019re sitting behind the director, watching as Namjoon films some of the extras.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll text you if anything comes up,\u201d Hoseok says simply, patting Yoongi on the butt. Yoongi\u2019s a little too exhausted to glare at him, so he decides he\u2019ll do it later as he plods off to his trailer, rubbing at his sore neck. He steps inside his trailer, locks the door behind him, and then lets his body collapse onto the bed.</p>\n<p>\u201cOw, hyung!\u201d</p>\n<p>Yoongi nearly screeches in surprise as he hurries to fling Jimin off the bed, watching as the younger lands in a heap on the floor.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat the fuck are you doing in my trailer?\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin looks adorably sleepy, his hair mussed and his eyes drooping. He looks around in mild confusion before rubbing at his cheek with one hand\u2014and internally, Yoongi tells his heart to stop beating so fast because dammit, he doesn\u2019t need these kinds of feelings.</p>\n<p>\u201cI thought I was in my own trailer,\u201d Jimin says petulantly, standing up and rubbing at his arms. Yoongi\u2019s still half-frozen in surprise, so Jimin takes the opportunity to climb back in bed.</p>\n<p>\u201cGet out,\u201d Yoongi grits, and he thinks that maybe Jimin\u2019s gone deaf because he does the exact opposite and wraps his arms around Yoongi\u2019s shoulders, nestling his cheek in the crook of Yoongi\u2019s neck. The warm breath of air that slides over his collarbones makes him shiver, and Yoongi hates himself for it.</p>\n<p>\u201cCan I please just stay a little longer,\u201d Jimin whines, and even though Yoongi hates whining he thinks that it\u2019s not so bad when paired with Jimin\u2019s flushed cheeks and pouting lips. \u201cI\u2019m so tired. And I don\u2019t know where Jungkook is. And I hate being by myself in my trailer, it smells weird and it\u2019s too cold.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin\u2019s sleep-talking now, Yoongi realizes in dismay, since the younger\u2019s eyes are firmly shut and his breathing\u2019s starting to slow down. Yoongi reaches behind his neck to try to unlatch Jimin\u2019s fingers, but he\u2019s halted by the feeling of how warm and soft Jimin\u2019s hands are.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re not cold at all, hyung,\u201d Jimin slurs, and Yoongi belatedly realizes that somehow his arm\u2019s now wrapped around Jimin\u2019s waist. \u201cEveryone says you are, but I know better.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yoongi wonders when Jimin\u2019s stopped talking about temperature.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou can stay for a little while, I guess,\u201d Yoongi allows, and he\u2019s not sure why he\u2019s talking out loud since Jimin can\u2019t hear him. He leans back into the pillows and feels Jimin shift with him, pressing his body closer, all hard planes and edges. Yoongi traces the soft curve of Jimin\u2019s cheek with his eyes, thinks about the softness of his hands, and wonders how Jimin is so different from everyone else he\u2019s met.</p>\n<p>\u201cI really wish you\u2019d leave me alone,\u201d Yoongi whispers, figuring that since Jimin won\u2019t say anything back, it\u2019s a good time to talk to him. \u201cI wish you\u2019d be like all the other people in the cast who just ignore me, because I know how to deal with that. I don\u2019t know how to deal with you, Park Jimin. I think maybe I like you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin gasps.</p>\n<p>-</p>\n<p>\n<em>The relationship between Sung Sooha and Yook Taesun is not an easy one. It\u2019s a good one, but it\u2019s hard. Their friends stop talking to them, customers at the restaurant sneer, and Taesun gets made fun of at work. Sooha sometimes wonders if the stress from their relationship is what made his mother drop dead.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>-</em>\n</p>\n<p>Yoongi doesn\u2019t speak to Jimin for four days after the \u2018incident.\u2019 He figures that if he tries hard enough, he won\u2019t have to speak to Jimin ever again.</p>\n<p>Taesun still needs to speak to Sooha, however, and that\u2019s how Yoongi finds himself face to face with Jimin. And they\u2019re <em>naked</em>.</p>\n<p>\u201cJust because this is a sex scene doesn\u2019t mean it has to be raunchy,\u201d Namjoon explains to them quickly, hands waving around in the air. \u201cI really want to showcase the artistry of it all, you feel me? So we\u2019ll capture things like silhouttes, blankets moving, stuff like that.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yoongi nods, shifting around from his spot where he\u2019s cocooned in blankets. It\u2019s not his first 19+ scene, and the fact that the opposite party is another man doesn\u2019t change much from the actor\u2019s perspective.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s Jimin\u2019s first time doing anything even remotely naughty, though, and Yoongi had felt the absurd urge to laugh at the sight of Jimin\u2019s eyes going comically large when he was handed the little sock to hide his dick in.</p>\n<p>And really, Yoongi\u2019s a little confused why they\u2019re filming the 19+ scene before they even film any of the kiss scenes, but then he figures that he should take this as a blessing since he\u2019s not sure if he\u2019d be able to stay in character if he was made to kiss Jimin right now.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo, just pretend like you\u2019re going at it, okay?\u201d Namjoon finishes, and Yoongi nods.</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Jimin murmurs, quieter than usual. He\u2019s laying down on his stomach in the middle of the large bed they\u2019d been provided with, resting his head on top of his crossed arms. He\u2019s nervous, Yoongi can tell, because he\u2019s biting at his lip and his knuckles are white with tension and he doesn\u2019t relax even when Namjoon moves back to his seat.</p>\n<p>Yoongi allows himself to peek over his shoulder, looking at Jimin. The younger looks miserable.</p>\n<p>\u201cLook, Jimin,\u201d Yoongi whispers quietly, turning to face him completely. Namjoon\u2019s off talking with Taehyung, discussing angles for the next shot, and Yoongi knows he\u2019s got a little extra time.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry for what I said,\u201d he says quickly, ignoring the way Jimin opens his eyes wide. \u201cI thought you were asleep, and I was just thinking out loud, and really, I didn\u2019t mean it to go like that. I don\u2019t know what I meant.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin nods slowly, trying to take it all in. Yoongi watches as he licks his lips.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo, you didn\u2019t mean what you said then. You\u2019re\u2026 taking it back?\u201d</p>\n<p>And Jimin looks more hurt than he\u2019s ever looked before, and even if Yoongi had wanted to lie to him he can\u2019t now that Jimin\u2019s eyes are shining and he\u2019s clenching his hands more than ever. He hears the <em>clack</em> of the clapperboard signaling them to begin, and so he leans down and whispers against Jimin\u2019s ear so the microphones won\u2019t pick it up.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, I still like you.\u201d</p>\n<p>And then Jimin goes stiff, hiding his face in the pillows and Yoongi doesn\u2019t know what his reaction is and the strange sensation of hot worry fills his chest. But the cameras are rolling and Yoongi can feel the warmth of the stage lights burning his shoulders so he forces himself to become Taesun and ignores the fact that this is the first time the transition\u2019s never come easy to him.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey, relax,\u201d Yoongi coaxes, drumming his fingers against Jimin\u2019s shoulders softly. Jimin turns to look at him, but Yoongi only sees Sooha in his eyes and knows that Jimin\u2019s just acting. For some reason, Yoongi feels disappointed.</p>\n<p>\u201cI am relaxed,\u201d Jimin huffs out, lifting himself onto his elbows to look at Yoongi.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh good,\u201d Yoongi smiles thinly, and he leans forward to press his lips against Jimin\u2019s forehead. He tries not to think about the fact that this is the first time his lips have ever touched any part of Jimin\u2019s skin.</p>\n<p>Jimin\u2019s still stiff though, stiff and unfeeling and Yoongi thinks that there\u2019s no way he looks convincing at all, so he lets his fingers run down and trace over Jimin\u2019s ribs, dipping into the soft hollows at his hips.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou don\u2019t feel very relaxed,\u201d Yoongi remarks, and when he moves his hands around to feel across the younger\u2019s spine he finally feels Jimin sink into his touch. His sigh is too soft for the microphones, and Yoongi\u2019s glad that in their oh-so-public moment he has a little part of Jimin just for himself.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m just a little\u2026\u201d Jimin bites at his lip, and Yoongi\u2019s not sure if that\u2019s because of the script or because of Yoongi\u2019s thumbs rubbing circles into the soft skin of Jimin\u2019s hip.</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2014nervous,\u201d Jimin finishes lamely, his breathing quickening a little. Yoongi grins, and maybe it\u2019s a bit predatory but he can\u2019t help himself because Jimin\u2019s all spread out underneath him, all long lines and smooth skin and Yoongi thanks Namjoon with all the breath in his body for hiring that one auditionee that walked in late.</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t be nervous,\u201d Yoongi soothes, leaning down to trace Jimin\u2019s collarbone with his lips. Yoongi <em>knows</em> that Jimin\u2019s shiver isn\u2019t scripted, and it makes him smile just a little more.</p>\n<p>\u201cAfter all,\u201d Yoongi continues, belatedly remembering that he\u2019s supposed to be going off the script and not just the intoxicating feeling of touching Jimin\u2019s body, \u201cYou never need to be nervous as long as I\u2019m around.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin looks up at Yoongi with trusting eyes, and Yoongi presses hot kisses up the side of Jimin\u2019s neck.</p>\n<p>\u201cI love you,\u201d Yoongi finishes, glad he doesn\u2019t have to remember any more lines since the way Jimin is looking at him is making it hard to remember anything.</p>\n<p>And Jimin doesn\u2019t say it back since Sooha never says it to Taesun, and that\u2019s alright because suddenly Jimin\u2019s lips are pressed against Yoongi\u2019s and Yoongi manages to think that he\u2019s a terrible actor right before his mind goes blank.</p>\n<p>They stay like that for longer that Yoongi had expected, long enough for him to map out the inside of Jimin\u2019s mouth with his tongue and feel the way Jimin\u2019s hands thread into his hair. It\u2019s so long that he nearly forgets that they\u2019re filming, and he\u2019s surprised when Namjoon calls out \u201ccut.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yoongi looks up to see Taehyung rolling the camera to the side, and Seokjin\u2019s flashing him a thumbs up so Yoongi assumes their scene looked alright. Jimin looks downright startled at the sudden influx of attention and hurries to tuck his face against Yoongi\u2019s shoulder, pressing his hot cheek against Yoongi\u2019s skin.</p>\n<p>\u201cHyung,\u201d Jimin whispers quickly, and Yoongi looks down at him curiously.</p>\n<p>Jimin looks up to meet his eyes and smiles brilliantly. \u201cI like you too.\u201d</p>\n<p>-</p>\n<p>\n<em>It\u2019s Sooha that finally inspires Taesun to pick up his camera and take the kind of photos he loves again. Taesun starts by taking photos of Sooha. And then he takes photos of interesting people that wander into the restaurant. And then he takes photos of interesting people around town. He gathers their stories, collects their words, and releases a book. Somehow, it\u2019s a success.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>-</em>\n</p>\n<p>Filming wraps up neatly. Namjoon\u2019s pleased with the work that they\u2019ve done, and when the film finally reaches the final stages of post-production he calls Jimin and Yoongi and tells them to be prepared to visit the Busan International Film Festival.</p>\n<p>And yes, that\u2019s a big step for such a small indie film, but Min Yoongi is a household name, and Kim Namjoon\u2019s starting to become one too.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s exciting, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Seokjin says, and even though he\u2019s the oldest one out of all of them he\u2019s bouncing on the tips of his toes like a little kid. Yoongi smiles, since he\u2019s come to grow fond of Seokjin throughout the filming process, and it\u2019s nice to see him get excited about something. He deserves is, Yoongi thinks fondly, given all the work he\u2019s put into <em>Banchan</em>.</p>\n<p>\u201cI can\u2019t wait,\u201d Namjoon agrees easily, and Yoongi laughs to himself because even though his tone is confident his fingers are shaking.</p>\n<p>\u201cRelax, Namjoon,\u201d Yoongi cuts in, and the only reason he\u2019s not as jittery as the other two is because he\u2019s been here before. (Winning BIFF Actor of the Year is enough to placate his nerves for a century, he thinks.)</p>\n<p>\u201cEasy for you to say.\u201d</p>\n<p>It\u2019s Jimin\u2019s voice that interrupts him, and Yoongi can\u2019t even be mad or berate him about his manners because Jimin suddenly turns and plants a kiss on Yoongi\u2019s cheek, and all of the negative emotions melt away.</p>\n<p>Seokjin snickers, and Yoongi half-heartedly gives him the finger.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re only calm because you\u2019ve won an award here,\u201d Jimin continues, and his expression is so warm and proud and fond that Yoongi\u2019s not sure if he wants to kiss Jimin or roll his eyes.</p>\n<p>\u201cMaybe you\u2019ll win one next, huh?\u201d Yoongi teases, pinching at Jimin\u2019s side. Jimin laughs and brushes his hand away, and Yoongi takes a moment to let himself get caught up in Jimin\u2019s breathless smile and bright eyes.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe should go find out seats,\u201d Namjoon says, looking down at his watch. \u201cYou guys can go be disgustingly cute after the show, okay?\u201d</p>\n<p>The director pulls Jimin with him out to the rows of auditorium seats, and Yoongi\u2019s left fuming by himself since Min Yoongi is <em>never</em> disgustingly cute.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m glad things have worked out for you two,\u201d Seokjin says, resting a hand on Yoongi\u2019s shoulder.</p>\n<p>\u201cMe too,\u201d Yoongi admits, watching fondly as Jimin whacks at Namjoon\u2019s shoulder and then scurries away, hiding behind a bored-looking Jungkook. \u201cI guess I have to thank you for writing <em>Banchan</em>, since without it I never would have found Jimin.\u201d</p>\n<p>Seokjin grins. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to thank me. Writing it was probably the best thing I\u2019ll ever do in my career anyway.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yoongi looks at Seokjin curiously, since he\u2019d assumed that <em>Silent Forest</em> is probably the highlight of Seokjin\u2019s career so far. \u201cReally? Why is that?\u201d</p>\n<p>He watches as Seokjin stares out into the audience, and then follows his line of vision until he can tell that Seokjin\u2019s looking at Namjoon, who\u2019s already sitting in his seat.</p>\n<p>\u201cA similar story happened to me,\u201d Seokjin smiles, and his entire expression softens and Yoongi wonders how he\u2019d never noticed it before. \u201cWell, minus the ending of course. That\u2019s just to make it more interesting.\u201d</p>\n<p>That makes Yoongi laugh, and he follows Seokjin out to claim their own seats. Next to him, Jimin greets him with a toothy smile and secretly laces his fingers with Yoongi\u2019s. Yoongi wonders how he\u2019s managed to play a hundred characters that fall in love, and yet he\u2019s never felt this way before.</p>\n<p>The next hour passes in a blur, and Yoongi fidgets the entire time until before he realizes it, he\u2019s suddenly being shoved up on stage.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe won, we did it!\u201d Jimin\u2019s shouting next to him, and somehow him and Namjoon and Seokjin are all clustered around Yoongi in the center of the stage. Blood\u2019s pounding through his ears so he can\u2019t hear Seokjin and Namjoon make their speeches, and he barely makes out Jimin\u2019s babble of \u201cthank yous\u201d and \u201coh my gods,\u201d and then suddenly the sleek trophy is thrust into his arms and his mouth\u2019s in front of the microphone.</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t really know what to say,\u201d Yoongi stammers, faced with thousands of upturned faces and flashing lights. He feels the solid warmth of Jimin at his side and steels himself. \u201cJust, thank you, for voting <em>Banchan</em> as the winner. I know a lot of these topics are still taboo, but as a people, how can we get anywhere without acknowledging this?\u201d</p>\n<p>There\u2019s polite applause from the audience, and Yoongi lets it die down before he continues.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sure many people didn\u2019t expect me to take on this role,\u201d he says quietly, narrowing his eyes as his voice still resonates throughout the hall. \u201cHonestly, I didn\u2019t expect it either. But I\u2019m so, so glad I did.\u201d</p>\n<p>He turns and looks at Jimin who\u2019s practically glowing with happiness, and suddenly all of Yoongi\u2019s many awards and accolades don\u2019t matter because he\u2019s never been as proud of anything as he is of Jimin in this moment.</p>\n<p>\u201cWithout <em>Banchan</em>,\u201d Yoongi continues, and his eyes are only trained on Jimin because no one else in the room even matters, \u201cI would never have met Park Jimin.\u201d</p>\n<p>The room erupts into noise, and there\u2019s yelling and boos intermixed with the cheers and three security guards quickly usher them backstage, but none of it matters to Yoongi because Jimin leans in and whispers, \u201cI love you too.\u201d</p>\n<p>-</p>\n<p>\n<em>Sung Sooha is killed in a car crash.
