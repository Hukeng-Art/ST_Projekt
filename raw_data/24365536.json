  "text": "<p>\n<span>When they get to New York City, the first thing Luke wants to do is shop.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>For </span>\n<em>\n<span>clothes.</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<span>In Soho.</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Percy regrets his life so hard right now.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>It\u2019s worse than shopping with his mom. Luke doesn\u2019t even let Percy sit on an armchair and exchange commiserating glances with the other innocent bystanders. Instead, he drags Percy around with him, shoving hangers into his hands and telling him it\u2019s for strength training when he complains. Percy\u2019s about to just drop everything on the floor\u2014not even Luke can get away with murder in a public place\u2014when Luke glances down at his arms, then back up at his face, and raises his eyebrows. And then, well. It\u2019s only when Percy finds himself press-ganged into a fitting room does he realize that Luke has tricked Percy into shopping, too.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Evil. Pure evil. This trip is doomed.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Percy doesn\u2019t need new clothes. His Camp Half-Blood shirt looks fine. It doesn\u2019t have holes in it or anything. Honestly, they both have enough to wear. Luke even has two pairs of shoes now, since Percy gave him the flying ones back as soon as Argus dropped them off.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIs this blood?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYeah. But it\u2019s my blood.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIs that supposed to make me feel better about blood on my shoes?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cConsidering that you tried to kill me with them, yeah.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>At that, Luke had rolled his eyes, like Percy was the one being a big baby about a few drops of blood. Whatever. The stupid cursed flying shoes are Luke\u2019s problem now. Percy\u2019s going to use the free backpack space to pack actually important things, like snacks.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Luke buys a designer suit jacket, a shirt that isn\u2019t bright orange, fitted pants and a pair of fashionable sneakers, pulling off the evil male model look as well as he did when he was raising an army of monsters and putting Kronos together like a one million piece puzzle. Percy buys one plain blue T-shirt, and then he drags Luke to a mini mart, where he makes Luke buy him ten packs of jelly beans and a couple king-size M&amp;Ms.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>When Luke starts adding things like vegetables to his grocery basket, Percy tells him that he\u2019s gonna wait outside. Thankfully, this time Luke lets him go.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Percy beelines for the skateboard shop across the street and presses his nose to the front window. There\u2019s a bright orange longboard with \u201cI SURVIVED SCHOOL TODAY\u201d painted on it in big white letters, which seems pretty useful. Still, the boards aren\u2019t as cool as the ones in the shop at Rockefeller Center. Percy will take what he can get, though.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>That\u2019s pretty much his plan for this entire trip anyway.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Percy leans his forehead against the cool glass, only resisting the urge to knock his head against it a few times because the shopkeeper is already giving him a dirty look.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>What is he doing? They aren\u2019t ready to go get the Golden Fleece. Percy\u2019s operation in Camp Half-Blood can carry on without him for a couple days, but he needs to be there in order to really make progress. Without a camper to coordinate, there\u2019s only so much the naiads and nymphs can do.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>But, Percy also needs to figure out what to do with Luke. Keeping him at camp like this won\u2019t end in anything but tragedy. And if Percy can\u2019t defuse the landmine, he\u2019s going to have to step on it, and he doesn\u2019t want Annabeth or Grover or anyone else to be around for the explosion.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Yup. Percy\u2019s doing just fine. He doesn\u2019t need to know what he\u2019s doing. This is how he rolls.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Suddenly, a shadow. Percy\u2019s entire body twitches, and he hears a soft scoff.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhy are you looking at skateboards?\u201d asks Luke.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cMaybe Kronos wants us to get a skateboard.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Luke presses a hand on the top of Percy\u2019s head and physically turns him away from the window display.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cDoes Kronos want us to get a skateboard,\u201d he says.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201c\u2026No.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Luke gives Percy a dirty look. Then he lets Percy\u2019s head go in favor of grabbing his wrist, dragging him away from the store like he\u2019s an actual child.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Jerk.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Well, Annabeth wouldn\u2019t have let Percy waste time by looking at the skateboards either, but that\u2019s different. Annabeth is Percy\u2019s friend. Luke is the guy who tried to drag him into Tartarus by his own flying shoes.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHey!\u201d Percy protests. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to pull me.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThen walk on your own,\u201d Luke says. He tightens his grip painfully before letting go.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Percy rubs his wrist, sulking, but he doesn\u2019t stray from Luke\u2019s side again.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>After a moment of silence for Percy\u2019s dignity, Luke side-eyes him and asks, \u201cWhat\u2019s your plan for getting us to the Sea of Monsters? And don\u2019t tell me that we\u2019re skateboarding there.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Percy shuts his mouth.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Last time, Percy had prayed to the ocean, and then his dad had sent a school of hippocampi to help him out. For some reason, Percy doesn\u2019t think that\u2019ll happen this time around.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>So he just says, \u201cUh, hello?\u201d while gesturing to his general son-of-Poseidon-ness</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Luke makes a face that says, </span>\n<em>\n<span>Oh, right, Percy\u2019s a weirdly powerful demigod, but I momentarily forgot again because he\u2019s such a Seaweed Brain.</span>\n</em>\n<span> It\u2019s a face that Annabeth wears a lot, and it\u2019s making Percy miss her even more.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<span>You promised, Seaweed Brain. We would not get separated! Ever again!</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>No. Things will be different this time around.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cPercy?\u201d Luke says, in a tone that implies he\u2019s already repeated himself several times.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cRight.\u201d Percy blinks. \u201cThe Sea of Monsters. No big deal. Not to brag,\u201d he continues, bragging, \u201cbut I could sail us there on a pool floatie.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cBut you won\u2019t,\u201d Luke says. He looks like he has a headache.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201c...But I won\u2019t,\u201d Percy agrees reluctantly. \u201cWell, how do you want to do it then? I don\u2019t think anyone\u2019s gonna sell two kids a boat for,\u201d Percy checks his pockets, \u201cfour blue jelly beans and the destruction of Western civilization.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cFirst of all, you\u2019re a kid. I\u2019m an adult. And second,\u201d Luke pauses dramatically, looking pleased to know something that Percy doesn\u2019t. \u201cThere is someone who would sell us a boat for that.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p><br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u2014\u2014</span>\n</p>\n<p><br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Okay, Percy understands why Luke wanted that evil male model look now.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Luke\u2019s boat seller lives in one of the fanciest skyscrapers in Manhattan, the kind with a doorman and a receptionist and personal elevators to the top floors. Framed in the weird geometric couch that Percy couldn\u2019t figure out how to sit on, Luke looks right at home. Percy is getting dirty looks from the receptionist.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Honestly, Percy hasn\u2019t felt this much like a bug crawling on someone\u2019s shoe since he was fourteen and talking to Athena for the first time. And he wasn\u2019t even pretending to be allied with a titan lord trying to destroy an entire pantheon of gods then.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Percy shifts uncomfortably.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Yeah. This is much worse. But, it\u2019s fine. Even if he isn\u2019t dressed for the part, Percy can totally pull off evil.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>He glances up at Luke, trying to figure out how to project the desire to exact vengeance on his parents and destroy Western civilization regardless of how many of his friends will die. Is it the scar? Percy doesn\u2019t think he can give himself a facial disfigurement in the next two minutes and still have it look cool.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Luke frowns. \u201cWhat are you doing with your eyebrows?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNothing,\u201d Percy grumbles.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>They sit in silence until\u2014</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cMr. Germanicus will see you now,\u201d says the receptionist, gesturing to one of the elevators. He sniffs imperiously as Percy passes his desk. Percy resists the urge to stick out his tongue. Then he does it anyway, since there has to be at least one upside to being twelve again.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Besides, you know, being able to change the course of your entire life.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The elevator ride is direct and short, which is good because Percy isn\u2019t sure if he can actually share a small space with Luke for more than twenty seconds without either one of them suffering a serious injury. So, it\u2019s a pretty awkward ride to the top floor of the building. Luke stares stonily at the doors, and Percy tries not to fidget noticeably. At least the boat seller has better elevator music than the Underworld.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>As the doors open, Luke straightens up further. Percy didn\u2019t even know that was possible. He was already standing like Kronos had ironed out his spine.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>And the guy he\u2019s so nervous about doesn\u2019t look like much either.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAh, hello, Mr. Castellan,\u201d says the guy. \u201cI thought we\u2019d be seeing you again.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Luke\u2019s boat seller looks like a weird mix of Mr. D and Smelly Gabe, but with a neckbeard. His purple suit seems expensive, and he\u2019s wearing gold chains around his neck. Lounging on the sectional behind him are two other guys, a beefier version of Hercules and a skinny guy who reminds Percy of a pike. Maybe they\u2019re the boat seller\u2019s more good-looking entourage. Rich people like that kind of thing, right?</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cSirs.\u201d Luke nods at the boat seller and his entourage.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAnd your friend\u2026?\u201d The boat seller smiles at Percy. It feels slimy.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Friend is a strong word, but Percy will let it slide, since, judging by the look Luke\u2019s giving him, he might get tossed out the floor-to-ceiling windows if he doesn\u2019t.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Luke clamps a hand on Percy\u2019s shoulder and answers, \u201cPercy Jackson, son of Poseidon.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cPoseidon?\u201d Pike Man asks. His gaze is flat and cold.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYeah,\u201d Percy says. \u201cWhat\u2019s it to you?\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Luke\u2019s hand tightens like a vise. \u201cPlease excuse him. He gets cranky when he\u2019s hungry.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Percy opens his mouth to protest, but then Luke\u2019s grip goes so tight that Percy becomes genuinely worried about whether he\u2019ll be able to regain full use of his shoulder. As Percy tries his best to keep his face from twisting, Luke steps forward, walking half in front of him as the boat seller leads them to the couch.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Mr. Castellan. I know how children are. I have a young daughter myself, you know. But, enough pleasantries.\u201d The boat seller settles down between Beefier Hercules and Pike Man. \u201cWhy have you come to speak with us today?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Luke leans forward, lacing his fingers together. \u201cI have a proposal I think you might be interested in.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cReally?\u201d The boat seller smirks. \u201cWell, I do hope you\u2019ve improved your pitch from last time. We are rather choosy, but that\u2019s because we take each investment quite personally. We don\u2019t involve any outside investors\u2014just our own capital, and though it is substantial, we don\u2019t like letting it go to waste.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYes,\u201d Luke says. It sounds like he\u2019s forcing the words out through his gritted teeth. \u201cI spent a long time thinking over your advice.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The boat seller folds his hands under his weak chin. \u201cLet\u2019s hear it then.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>And Percy knows that Luke is charismatic. He\u2019s a good public speaker, and he\u2019s very convincing. That\u2019s part of the reason why he was able to recruit so many demigods from Camp Half-Blood even before he had a shipful of monsters. But, Luke\u2019s only ever put a token effort into coaxing Percy over to Kronos; he\u2019s always been much more interested in killing him. That\u2019s why Percy\u2019s still surprised when he hears Luke explain his plan to the boat seller.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>It doesn\u2019t sound like the half-formed idea Percy described to Luke in the woods, constantly pausing and restarting, his voice so quiet that the creek almost drowned it out. With the bare bones Percy tossed him, Luke paints the end of Western civilization in brilliant technicolor. The retrieval of the Golden Fleece, the strategic recruitment of an army, the completion of the 1000 piece titan puzzle. Death. Destruction. The normal Kronos stuff. It\u2019s a glorious vision of everything Percy spent four years fighting against.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Luke carefully skirts around the prophecy\u2014probably because he isn\u2019t sure if Percy knows about it yet\u2014but the way he glances at Percy when he talks about the fall of Olympus indicates that the boat seller is probably aware.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The way that the boat seller\u2019s eyes glint when he looks at Percy, too, confirms that.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Once Luke finishes, there\u2019s a brief silence. Beefier Hercules and Pike Man exchange glances. The boat seller claps his hands together.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWell,\u201d he says, \u201cthis has been very interesting, Mr. Castellan. I must confess that previously we were somewhat skeptical of your...ability to execute your proposals.\u201d Luke\u2019s jaw twitches. \u201cBut you\u2019ve made a good pitch.\u201d The boat seller looks at Percy one more time, smiling in a way that makes him feel dirty, before turning back to Luke. \u201cThere\u2019s a ship docked at the Manhattan Cruise Terminal. The </span>\n<em>\n<span>Princess Andromeda</span>\n</em>\n<span>. You\u2019ll find it rather hard to miss, I\u2019m sure, and\u2014\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHold on a sec,\u201d Percy blurts out. Is this guy for real? \u201cYou\u2019re living it up in Manhattan. Why do you want Western civilization destroyed?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Luke glares at Percy, his hands curling, but Percy\u2019s more annoyed by how the boat seller is looking at him like he\u2019s a particularly dumb puppy.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhy, Mr. Jackson,\u201d the boat seller cries, \u201cit\u2019s because we\u2019re investors, of course! The current Western civilization is all well and good, but why be satisfied with good when there is always better? Mr. Castellan and you have so much potential. We want to provide our full support and guidance to young people like you two who can lead our world into a better future.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Beefier Hercules coughs into his fist. Pike Man rolls his eyes.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The boat seller grins.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAnd to fertilize the ground for a better future,\u201d he continues, leaning towards Percy like he\u2019s sharing a secret, \u201cthere needs to be a true conflagration. Flames stoked by blood.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>In his eyes, Percy can see a city on fire, people burning alive on crosses. He tries to move away, but he finds that he\u2019s already flattened himself against the back of the couch.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Luke clears his throat. The boat seller sits back. He\u2019s still smiling.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Wait a minute.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Incredible wealth. Investment in the future. Flames and blood.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Luke is speaking. \u201cThank you for your generosity\u2014\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Flames and blood.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou\u2019re Nero,\u201d Percy says.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Luke\u2019s words cut off.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cMy,\u201d Nero says. \u201cI\u2019m flattered that someone as young as you would know little old me.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cCommodus,\u201d Percy looks at Beefier Hercules. \u201cCaligula.\u201d He shifts his gaze to Pike Man.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThree for three!\u201d Nero turns to Commodus. \u201cThe Internet truly is a wonderful invention, isn\u2019t it? Seven hundred years ago, your average child couldn\u2019t even\u2014\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Percy would like to say that he had a plan before moving. That it was a calculated decision to uproot a threat before it speared them in the back.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>But, the truth is that he wasn\u2019t thinking about his plans.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>He wasn\u2019t thinking about anything but the quest he refused, the funeral he wasn\u2019t invited to, the body he never saw.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<span>It\u2019s Jason.</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Emperors.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Murderers.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>They should all just die.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Blades. Arrows. Blood in the water.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Die, like how Jason died.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Wait.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>No.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>First, they have to suffer.</span>\n</p>\n<p><br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>It probably only lasted a few seconds. Maybe minutes. Definitely not hours.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Percy isn\u2019t sure. At this point, all he knows is that he\u2019s lying on the carpet for some reason. He\u2019s cold. His stomach hurts. His cheek is sticky and wet.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cPercy.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Someone is saying his name. He should answer.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Percy shifts his gaze in the direction of the voice. He sees a pair of stained sneakers, the pant cuffs above them ripped and splattered dark.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cCan you hear me?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Slowly, Percy nods.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOkay,\u201d says the voice. \u201cOkay. I\u2019m going to move closer to you now.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Don\u2019t. No.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Percy isn\u2019t really sure what he does, but by the end of it, he\u2019s gasping on the floor, and the sneakers are gone.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOr not.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The sound of someone walking, moving around him. Water running.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>It comes to Percy\u2019s attention that being in an unknown situation, possibly surrounded by people, is not a good thing. He should fix that. Probably by getting up and actually trying to figure out what\u2019s going on.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>But, Percy also feels like if he moves wrong, his body will collapse into a puddle of water, and he only hears one person\u2019s footsteps anyway, and everywhere he looks, everything is covered with\u2014with\u2014</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Percy doesn\u2019t throw up. But that\u2019s only because his entire abdomen might shatter if he does.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>So he just lies there, shaking and shaking and shaking.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>An indeterminable amount of time later, the voice returns.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI\u2019ve got the papers for the boat, Percy. Once you\u2019re ready, we can go.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Percy doesn\u2019t move.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cCan you stand?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>He concentrates on making himself breathe. It seems like such a chore all of a sudden. The air is too heavy. And it\u2019s cold.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Why is it always so cold?</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>A long silence.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>And then\u2014</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cDo you want me to help you up?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>No. All Percy wants to do is lie here and close his eyes and sleep forever.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Instead, he reaches out a hand.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Luke takes it.</span>\n</p>\n<p><br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u2014\u2014</span>\n</p>\n<p><br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The </span>\n<em>\n<span>Princess Andromeda</span>\n</em>\n<span> is officially the worst boat Percy has ever sailed. And that\u2019s not even because he got Charlie Beckendorf killed here once upon another time.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Percy just hates cruise ships, okay? They\u2019re big and clunky and mostly electronic. Percy\u2019s good with boats, not floating Lotus Hotels. Even the </span>\n<em>\n<span>Pax</span>\n</em>\n<span> moved like an extension of his body. Controlling the </span>\n<em>\n<span>Princess Andromeda</span>\n</em>\n<span> is like trying to do origami with his feet, except he has plastic sporks instead of toes. Also, it feels like bad things are always happening on cruise ships. This trip included.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>At least Percy has managed to avoid Luke so far. The only reason why he knows Luke hasn\u2019t toppled over the side of the yacht, thereby neatly solving the problem of what Percy should do about him, is because celery sticks and baby carrots keep on appearing in the bridge, where Percy spends most of his time coaxing the </span>\n<em>\n<span>Princess Andromeda</span>\n</em>\n<span> into giving them running water and keeping the lights on and actually going where they need to go. In return, Percy takes the candy bags he\u2019s picked all the blue pieces out of and leaves them outside the admiralty suite\u2019s stateroom. Even budding villains need a balanced diet, after all.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Percy\u2019s not really avoiding Luke on purpose. That would be counterproductive. He\u2019s just...busy. It takes a lot of work to run a cruise ship single handedly, especially when that ship would rather light up the indoor mall or fill the pool instead of sail at a respectable speed.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>And if Percy spends way too much time inventorying the storerooms in such detail that Annabeth would be proud, that\u2019s just because he doesn\u2019t want to have to stop and resupply at Monster Donut. Not because he\u2019s trying to take his mind off the thing he can\u2019t think about because if he does, he\u2019ll have to lie down, and then he\u2019ll never be able to get up ever again.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Come to think of it, Luke seems to be taking that thing pretty well. He hasn\u2019t even run away screaming. Possibly because he\u2019s been avoiding Percy as much as Percy\u2019s been avoiding him.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Luke hasn\u2019t been ignoring Percy, though. Instead, it feels more like he\u2019s observing. Carefully. He\u2019s been moving around the ship like he has experience living around people who might go crazy at any second. Which he does.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Percy also tries not to think about that. Thinking about it makes him feel sorry for Luke, which he\u2019s uncomfortable about and which would probably make Luke want to kill him even more than he already does.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Still, this means the scare-Luke-straight plan was never going to work, and Percy can cross that one off the list. Which is a relief, because he doesn\u2019t actually know what would happen if he tried being scary.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Percy doesn\u2019t want to know what would happen if he actually tried being scary.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Maybe annoying Luke into submission will work. Of course, this has never gone well for Percy before, and it involves actually talking to Luke, which has always been at the bottom of Percy\u2019s bucket list. Why is he even considering this again?</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<span>Whether you feel like you succeeded or not, you reminded Luke who he was. You spoke to him.</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Alright, alright, Percy knows that he\u2019s procrastinated enough already. It\u2019s fine. Percy\u2019s an adult. He can speak to Luke. And if this doesn\u2019t work out, there\u2019s always the duel to the death.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>And it looks like Luke\u2019s already getting ready for it.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Percy follows the sound of something getting the shit beaten out of it to the mall, where Luke has dragged all the mannequins out into the plaza. He\u2019s outfitted them in yoga mat armor secured with woven belts and is now dismembering them one by one.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>It\u2019s not that creepy. Percy has to tell himself this several times before he can convince himself to step away from the door and into the mall.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cLuke,\u201d he calls from a safe distance. \u201cI need to ask you something.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cBusy,\u201d Luke grunts, hacking away at one mannequin\u2019s torso. Is it just Percy, or is he slashing at it even more enthusiastically than before?</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNo, you\u2019re not.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI\u2019m training.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cCan\u2019t train without a sword.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhat?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Percy wags his fingers, and Luke\u2019s water bottle topples over. A jet of water spurts forward, knocking Backbiter out of his hand.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cPercy!\u201d Luke turns, finally letting the mannequin rest in pieces.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cDon\u2019t you use your camp counselor voice on me,\u201d Percy says. He keeps his voice light, trying not to sound intimidated or murderous or anything that might make Luke attack him. He still has the water from Luke\u2019s water bottle if things go wrong, though, so it\u2019s all good.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cFine.\u201d Luke folds his arms and narrows his eyes. \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Percy hesitates.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cCan you tell me about Thalia?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Luke blinks, his face gone slack. Percy spent a long time thinking about this approach, and this is the only opening he could come up with. If Luke decides to stab him here, then he won\u2019t know what else to do.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Thankfully, Luke doesn\u2019t stab him. Instead, he\u2019s quiet for a long, long time.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Then he says, in a low voice, \u201cWhy do you want to know about her?\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>He seems suspicious.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Percy shrugs. Be cool, be cool. \u201cOne time, Annabeth told me that we were pretty similar. That either we would be best friends or that we would strangle each other.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Luke snorts. \u201cAnnabeth was wrong. Thalia would\u2019ve strangled you after five minutes of hearing you speak.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Okay, no, actually Luke\u2019s the one who\u2019s wrong. It only took two minutes.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>But Percy can\u2019t point that out, and Luke is still talking. \u201cShe was strong. Tough.\u201d He looks Percy up and down, then shakes his head. \u201cShe\u2019d be better at this than you.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Percy isn\u2019t sure if he should be offended or not. \u201cBetter at what? Talking? Serving Kronos?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cBringing down Olympus,\u201d Luke snarls. He walks closer to Percy and picks Backbiter back up.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Percy stands his ground. \u201cYou really think Thalia would be into that?\u201d he asks.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Luke smiles coldly, his scar rippling. \u201cYou don\u2019t know anything, Percy. Because of the gods, Thalia and I lived on the streets for years, always running from monsters, always struggling to stay alive. And then, when Grover was sent to retrieve her\u2014only her\u2014she demanded that Annabeth and I be brought to safety, too. She stayed behind to fight off the Kindly Ones and save our lives. She was brave,\u201d he says, voice growing lower and lower. \u201cShe was worthy. And then, instead of saving her, her father turned her into a tree.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Luke\u2019s eyes flash, and then he\u2019s suddenly yelling in Percy\u2019s face.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cA tree!\u201d he screams. \u201cA fucking tree! After everything she did! She\u2019d be happy to see Olympus destroyed! Every throne crushed to rubble!\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Percy can\u2019t breathe. He\u2019s frozen in Luke\u2019s shadow.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Luke stares at Percy for one second, two. Then he backs away, Backbiter trembling in his white-knuckled grip.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIf Thalia were alive,\u201d Luke says, \u201cshe\u2019d be on my side. And we\u2019d tear the gods out of the sky. Together.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<span>Well? Are we going to stop him or not?</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>For some reason, Percy doubts that. He doubts that hard.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>You don\u2019t know Thalia at all, he wants to say. You\u2019re disrespecting her and her sacrifice, and when you get your second chance to know her again, you\u2019ll be too blind to even see her for who she is.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>But, if Percy says that, then they\u2019ll really have to have their duel to the death now, and there won\u2019t be any third chances. For either of them.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>So he tries another way.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cFine,\u201d Percy says, happy that his voice doesn\u2019t shake. \u201cThen if Kronos ordered you to destroy Thalia\u2019s tree, would you do it?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>A long silence. Percy knows they\u2019re floating in the middle of the ocean right now, but he can\u2019t even hear the waves.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Finally\u2014\u201cHe wouldn\u2019t,\u201d Luke says calmly. But his jaw is tight.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIt\u2019s strategic,\u201d Percy insists. \u201cWithout Thalia\u2019s tree, Camp Half-Blood is vulnerable. You could invade the camp, take demigods as prisoners of war, force them to join you or die. The gods wouldn\u2019t be able to move against you if you controlled all their children. Kronos could be resurrected using the power of their pledged loyalties. He\u2019d defeat the gods by sending an army of their children to die at their feet, and then he\u2019d tear Olympus down stone by stone, just like you always wanted.\u201d Percy smiles and nods, hoping he doesn\u2019t look as sick as he feels. \u201cAll you need to do is kill Thalia.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>By the time the word \u201ckill\u201d leaves Percy\u2019s lips, Luke already has Backbiter pointed at his throat.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI won\u2019t!\u201d Luke says frantically. \u201cI\u2014\u201d His eyes quiver, and he visibly forces his sword arm down. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter! Thalia\u2019s already dead!\u201d He takes a couple breaths, before continuing, \u201cThe gods made sure of that.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>His voice has gone flat again. It\u2019s the tone of a man who\u2019ll do anything\u2014hurt anyone\u2014for revenge.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNo,\u201d Percy tells him. \u201cNo. She\u2019s still there. She\u2019s the one protecting the demigods who\u2019ll defeat you.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>And that\u2019s when Percy goes too far. He knows it, because Luke smiles, and it\u2019s not cold or calculating or even cruel. It\u2019s just blank. A void.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cTell me, Percy,\u201d Luke says, creeping towards him at the pace of a predator. \u201cHas Kronos really ordered Thalia\u2019s tree destroyed, or are you just running your mouth again, just a stupid little kid abusing the name of the lord he serves?\u201d He looms over Percy, Backbiter in his hand. Percy is once again aware of how small he is at twelve, how Luke towers above him. He always did.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Luke leans into Percy\u2019s face and whispers, \u201cHow do you think Kronos will punish you for this?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Percy shudders. But it\u2019s not Kronos he\u2019s afraid of. Really, it rarely ever was.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cSomehow,\u201d Percy says quietly, backing towards the door. \u201cI don\u2019t think he\u2019ll find out. Besides, a stupid kid\u2019s still a better tool than someone who\u2019s blinded by their own rage.\u201d He adds, in a stronger voice, \u201cYou don\u2019t belong with Kronos, Luke.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cGet out,\u201d Luke says.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou know I\u2019m right.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201c</span>\n<em>\n<span>Go.\u201d</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cLuke,\u201d Percy says, staring up into his eyes. \u201cIf you bring down the gods, then you will destroy the people you love. You\u2019re going to have to make the choice to kill them over and over and over again. And once Kronos rises, it won\u2019t matter if you change your mind. You won\u2019t be able to protect anyone or preserve anything. You\u2019ll only get what you want when everything that was once Luke Castellan vanishes from this earth.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>For the first time, Percy is telling Luke the complete truth, and perhaps Luke can sense that. He\u2019s not moving, barely even breathing. He can\u2019t seem to tear his eyes away from Percy\u2019s.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Percy reaches the door. For a moment, neither of them say anything.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Then Percy adds, \u201cI bet Thalia wouldn\u2019t want that.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The spell breaks.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cGET OUT!\u201d Luke roars.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Backbiter clangs against the wall. He\u2019s thrown his sword at Percy.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cL\u2014\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cGET OUT!\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Percy gets out.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>So.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>That didn\u2019t really go according to plan.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Then again, in Percy\u2019s experience, nothing ever does. It\u2019s always been his crazy ideas that keep his head above water, and luckily, he never runs out of those.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Still, Percy decides to go back to avoiding Luke. Just for a couple of days. After all, the duel to the death was looking pretty imminent there for a second, and Annabeth would be sad if Luke never made it back to camp.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Also, Percy\u2019s never actually killed Luke before, and he isn\u2019t totally sure if he can do it. He really doesn\u2019t want to find out, either.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Percy goes back to hiding out at the bridge. Neither Luke nor his vegetables come visit, and Percy is perfectly fine with that. It feels sort of like living with Smelly Gabe again, except instead of his mom coming to get him when it\u2019s safe, Percy doesn\u2019t have anyone.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Of course, that doesn\u2019t mean he has the pleasure of pretending that Luke doesn\u2019t exist forever. Percy needs a way to check on his operation at Camp Half-Blood. Unfortunately, Percy can\u2019t I-M Annabeth or Grover for help because they\u2019ll want to know where he is, what he\u2019s doing, and why, which are all questions he can\u2019t answer without putting them in the danger he\u2019s actively working to keep them out of. And the other campers don\u2019t really trust Percy enough yet, so he can\u2019t trust them to not run off to Chiron or Mr. D the second that they figure out what he\u2019s doing.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Basically, what Percy needs is a spy who\u2019s already under his control. The good thing is that Luke has one of those, which means Kronos has one of those, which means Percy has one of those, since he\u2019s pretending to be Luke\u2019s hotline to Kronos. The bad thing is that this means Percy has to talk to Luke again.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Great.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Percy paces and thinks and plans. By the time he feels ready, it\u2019s nighttime, but maybe that\u2019s better. Maybe Luke will be less prickly when he\u2019s sleepy. Percy\u2019s also hoping that maybe Luke doesn\u2019t sleep with his sword. The image of Luke brandishing a pillow at him instead is amusing enough that he musters the courage to go knock on the stateroom door.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Percy waits for a couple seconds.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>No response.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>He knocks again. \u201cLuke, I need to talk to your spy at camp.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Nothing.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Is he already asleep?</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Percy pounds on the door. \u201cLuke!\u201d he yells. \u201cKronos wants me to talk to your spy!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The door suddenly swings open. Percy accidentally punches Luke in the chest.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cSorry!\u201d Percy says, leaping back. Luke folds his arms, leaning against the door frame. His hair is mussed, but Percy can\u2019t tell if it\u2019s bedhead or a specific look cultivated by evil nineteen year olds who are trapped on boats with preteens they\u2019re debating whether or not to murder. His face is completely neutral.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Percy tries not to scowl. He isn\u2019t that weak, is he? Actually, scratch that\u2014It\u2019s probably better this way. There\u2019s no reason to upset a murderous teenager unnecessarily, especially when you\u2019re asking him a favor.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Luke still isn\u2019t saying anything or moving. He\u2019s almost more intimidating this way. Percy really wishes his growth spurt would come sooner.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cUm,\u201d Percy says. \u201cCould you put me in contact with your spy, please?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Luke just looks at him.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Percy tries not to fidget. \u201c...You do have a way of contacting them, right?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>After a moment, Luke replies, \u201cYeah.\u201d He doesn\u2019t move out of the doorway.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Alright. Time to bring out the big swords. \u201cIf you help me, I\u2019ll show you what I was doing for Kronos over the summer,\u201d Percy cajoles.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Silence.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Luke taps his fingers on his bicep. He looks Percy up and down, clearly weighing his options.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Finally, he steps back, jerking his chin towards the inside of the stateroom.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>So far, so good. Percy does not feel like he\u2019s walking into a drakon cave at all.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The curtains are drawn across the huge windows stretching across the back wall, and that\u2019s the only reason why Percy can stay in the stateroom at all, considering that the rest of it looks almost exactly the same as it did when Percy was thirteen and Luke was asking him about his mom at javelin-point.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Percy hears the door slam shut behind him, and he flinches.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>It\u2019s fine. There\u2019s no golden sarcophagus here. Things are different this time around.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Luke walks around Percy and starts rustling through his backpack. Unless he\u2019s been keeping a sprinkler in there, he\u2019s probably not going to I-M his spy, which makes sense. I-Ms aren\u2019t exactly subtle.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Hold on a sec. Should Percy be concerned? He hadn\u2019t been thinking about this before, but if Luke\u2019s already recruited a spy and put a non-rainbow-dependent long-distance communication system in place at this point, does that mean\u2014</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou don\u2019t happen to have an army of monsters, too, do you?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Luke looks up. He seems caught off guard. \u201cNo.\u201d Then he adds, \u201cBut if Kronos needs one, I can\u2014\u201c</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNope, that\u2019s fine,\u201d Percy says quickly. \u201cKronos doesn\u2019t want us doing stuff with monsters. They\u2019re too\u2014uh, monster-y. He doesn\u2019t like that.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Luke shoots Percy a weird look, but goes back to his backpack. Percy swallows his sigh of relief.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>After another second of searching, Luke pulls out the gaudiest hand mirror in existence. It\u2019s a monstrosity, with curling roses and little angels sculpted around the rim. He takes it over to the sofa and sits down, raising an eyebrow at Percy until he walks over, too, settling down as far away from Luke as he can possibly get.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Luke clears his throat. \u201cMirror, mirror, in my hand\u2014\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cReally?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201c\u2014Aphrodite is the fairest in the land,\u201d he finishes, ignoring Percy entirely.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>For a moment, nothing happens.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Then there\u2019s rustling, a quick curse, and the sounds of someone getting their shoes on and closing a door with a click, shutting out the noise of snuffles and snores.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cLuke!\u201d a voice hisses. \u201cDo you know what time it is? And\u2014Where are you? What in the world are you doing? You told me that\u2014\u201c</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou\u2019re not in a position to ask questions, Silena,\u201d Luke interrupts. \u201cReport.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Wow. What an asshole. No wonder Silena defected. That\u2019s a pretty good reason, on top of the whole evil titan lord killing all her friends and family thing.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>A pause. Percy can hear Silena inhale.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>When she speaks again, her tone is mechanical. \u201cYour absence was noted a couple hours after you were supposed to return to camp. Two days ago, Chiron left to search for you and Percy with\u2014\u201c</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWait, Chiron left?\u201d Percy blurts out. He scrambles over to Luke\u2019s side of the sofa, bracing his hand against the cushion over his shoulder, and then he peers into the mirror. \u201cChiron\u2019s not at camp?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cPercy!\u201d Silena exclaims. Her hair is tied back in a messy braid, and she has dark circles under her eyes. \u201cYou\u2019re\u2014with Luke?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Luke sighs and pulls Percy\u2019s ankle out from under him, so his shoe isn\u2019t on the sofa. \u201cI didn\u2019t kidnap Percy, Silena.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYeah,\u201d Percy says, too excited to protest being manhandled again. \u201cI kidnapped Luke.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhat?\u201d Silena asks, while at the same time Luke flatly says, \u201cNo.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYes,\u201d Percy nods, mind spinning. \u201cHe had a nervous breakdown in the woods, so I decided to take him on a ten day cruise.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNo, I did not\u2014Silena!\u201d Luke says, as he notices the sympathetic look Silena is giving him.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou have seemed rather stressed this year,\u201d she says apologetically.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWell,\u201d Luke bites out, \u201cmaybe I would be less stressed if\u2014\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Okay, not the time. \u201cExcuse me?\u201d Percy raises his hand. \u201cCan you guys do this later?\u201d Preferably when he isn\u2019t here. \u201cSilena, I need you to go to Long Island Sound.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHuh?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cPlease?\u201d Percy begs. \u201cIt\u2019s important.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Silena looks equally confused and grumpy about being asked to trek to Long Island Sound in the middle of the night, and she grumbles quietly the whole way to the fireworks beach. Luke doesn\u2019t say anything as she walks, but he is watching Percy out of the corner of his eye, like he\u2019s trying to read his secrets directly off his face.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOkay,\u201d Silena says. \u201cWe\u2019re here.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cCan you point the mirror at the water?\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Percy squints at the dark waves. Then he takes a deep breath, leans towards the mirror, cups his hands around his mouth, and yells, \u201cHey! Is anyone home?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>His view of the estuary shakes as Silena fumbles her grip. Luke drags Percy back by the collar of his shirt, but he can still see the forms of the naiads swimming up to the surface.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHi, guys,\u201d Percy calls. \u201cHow\u2019s it going?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The naiads float just beneath the waves, a little shy in front of Silena and probably more than a little wary about Percy yelling at them through a fancy mirror. Still, they wave and point down and give him a thumbs up. One naiad even mimes a chef\u2019s kiss before winking.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Percy knows what that means.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThat\u2019s great!\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s\u2014That\u2019s better than great.\u201d The naiads work a lot faster than he expected. Maybe all of Percy\u2019s plans would go better if he just let other people do them. \u201cI owe you guys. A lot. Tell you what, how about the next time I see you, I do another flush of the narrows, get some of the runoff out of there?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The naiads all nod enthusiastically. If there\u2019s any body of water that deserves a good sand dollar or twelve, it\u2019s Long Island Sound.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cDid you seriously wake me up just to flirt with the naiads?\u201d Luke hisses.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Percy ignores him. \u201cCool. It\u2019s a date. Do you mind setting up tonight? Silena will help pick a spot.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI\u2019m doing what now?\u201d Silena says, sounding almost as irritated as Luke. \u201cPercy, what\u2019s going on?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAwesome.\u201d Percy flashes the naiads two thumbs up. \u201cKeep up the good work.\u201d Then he adds, \u201cSilena, you should probably take a few steps back.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cPercy,\u201d Luke begins dangerously, but he never finishes his sentence. Probably because he gets distracted by the splash of something huge emerging from the water.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>There\u2019s a building floating on the surface of Long Island Sound. It looks like a cross between the Hermes and Poseidon cabins. The roof is wood, but the base is stone, and the windows are mosaics of sea glass.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Luke\u2019s whole body tenses. \u201cIs that...\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIs that a cabin?!\u201d Silena shrieks.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNo,\u201d Percy says. He\u2019s grinning so wide that his cheeks hurt. \u201cIt\u2019s a small house that\u2019s going to magically appear near the cabins tomorrow morning.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cSo it\u2019s a cabin,\u201d Luke says numbly. \u201cAnother cabin. You\u2019re building cabins for the minor gods?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Ack. \u201cI\u2019m not,\u201d Percy says. \u201cThe minor gods don\u2019t have cabins at Camp Half-Blood.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cSo we should start building cabins for them?\u201d Silena asks. She sounds really excited.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNo, I meant\u2014\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNo, Silena, you heard Percy,\u201d Luke says. \u201cHe wants you to start building small houses for\u2014\u201c</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHey!\u201d Percy snaps. \u201cLook, the minor gods don\u2019t have cabins in Camp Half-Blood, because if they did\u2014and they don\u2019t\u2014it would look like Camp Half-Blood was trying to destroy the balance of power on Olympus\u2014\u201c</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhen, in fact, we\u2019re trying to destroy Olympus\u2014\u201d Luke mutters.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201c\u2014But,\u201d Percy says louder, \u201cif campers want to participate in a new arts and crafts project on campgrounds, that\u2019s our business, right? The gods shouldn\u2019t care about that.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>A pause.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Luke mouths the words \u201carts and crafts\u201d like he\u2019s never heard them before.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWell,\u201d Silena says. \u201cI don\u2019t see why they would.\u201d They\u2019ve never cared about anything else we\u2019ve made before, she doesn\u2019t say. But Percy still hears it.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>At Percy\u2019s direction, the naiads start floating the house down Euros Creek. Silena helps kick branches and rocks out of the way, keeping them from clipping the house\u2019s edges.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Luke doesn\u2019t say anything, but he doesn\u2019t look away from the mirror either. Every time a view of the house flashes by, his lips thin, and his eyes gleam.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Once they make it to the lake, Percy tells the naiads to take a break. Silena recenters her face in the mirror. Despite how tired she looks, she\u2019s beaming. \u201cThis is\u2026This is amazing, guys. I can\u2019t believe it.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI can\u2019t either,\u201d Luke says. \u201cOnce Mr. D sees that thing, he\u2019ll blast it to pieces.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cMr. D won\u2019t notice.\u201d Percy assures him, though he doesn\u2019t even find himself very convincing.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Luke gives Percy a look that makes it clear he\u2019s questioning his intelligence. \u201cHe has eyes.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t even know our names,\u201d Percy points out.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYeah, but he can count to </span>\n<em>\n<span>twelve.\u201d</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Percy considers that for a second.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Then\u2014\u201cHow often does Mr. D leave the Big House?\u201d he asks sweetly.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201c\u2026Fine.\u201d Luke gives in. Or maybe he just gives up. \u201cThe cabin might last a couple of weeks.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou mean the small house\u2014\u201c</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWe get it, Percy.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Percy turns back to the mirror and finds Silena looking at them with big, glittering eyes. She\u2019s still smiling.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cSilena?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cSorry.\u201d She laughs. \u201cI just\u2014I\u2019m so happy. I feel like I\u2019m finally doing something that helps.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cUh,\u201d Percy says. Whether this will help or not is still very up in the air. Like, so up there that Zeus couldn\u2019t hit it with his Master Bolt. Percy actually feels very bad about dumping all this responsibility on Silena, too. But he can\u2019t think of a better option. In the end, he trusts her to do what\u2019s best for the demigods. \u201cThen\u2014do you mind doing some more helping?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNot at all!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cUm,\u201d Percy takes a deep breath. \u201cI need you to find campers who\u2019ll help the naiads build. And people who\u2019ll negotiate with the dryads\u2014They\u2019ll exchange timber for protection against satyrs, and if you prune their branches, you\u2019ll get to keep the clippings. And you should pull a couple people from the Hermes cabin right now and have them occupy the first house. Mr. D can\u2019t harm campers. If he doesn\u2019t like our arts and crafts projects, we\u2019ll need to have people who\u2019re willing to shield them. And they can\u2019t be afraid of being turned into dolphins. Try Ethan Nakamura first,\u201d he suggests. \u201cI think he\u2019d do a lot for his own bed.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Silena looks a little overwhelmed, but she nods firmly. \u201cGot it.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThanks,\u201d Percy sighs. Then\u2014\u201cWait, there\u2019s one more thing.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYeah?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cCould you also find a way to actually get some beds?\u201d Percy glances away from the mirror, his cheeks hot. \u201cI, uh, I forgot about building furniture.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Silena laughs again. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, Percy. I know someone who\u2019d love to help.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Oh. Percy doesn\u2019t know how he feels about getting even more people involved in this. Well, he does know how he feels, but it isn\u2019t something he can explain to Silena without talking about the hundred other things he can\u2019t talk about. Then again, Percy has never fought any of his battles alone before, so there\u2019s no reason why he should expect things to be different this time.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>It\u2019s just\u2014hard. While creating a future where his friends are in less danger, how much danger should he be okay with putting them in? None of Percy\u2019s math classes have ever taught him how to balance this equation.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>While Percy worries about class action and divine retribution and plausible deniability, Silena directs the naiads in their placement of the house. Luke interjects occasionally, displeased with \u201ca vaporization ready to happen\u201d being planted so close to the Hermes cabin. Silena makes a comment about waterfront aesthetic, Luke retorts with a note on land-use regulation, and then they quickly descend into a hissed debate about city planning and yard space and form versus function in the construction of operational bases\u2014Houses, Luke, not bases. Small houses!</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Personally, Percy\u2019s on the side of the naiads, who are sighing and rolling their eyes as they bob the new cabin along the surface of the lake.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>And then\u2014Okay, Percy wouldn\u2019t say that he fell asleep, because it would be dumb to fall asleep in the same room as someone who has tried to kill you before and has done nothing to suggest he won\u2019t try again. Percy\u2019s stupid, but not that stupid. But, he really doesn\u2019t care about Camp Half-Blood\u2019s feng shui unless it prevents more campers from having their own beds. So, can you really blame him for blanking out halfway through Silena\u2019s argument against parallel house plots? Or...Actually, Percy isn\u2019t really sure when he stopped listening. It feels like he just blinked a couple times, and then bam! Everything\u2019s quiet, and the mirror\u2019s gone, and pale light is peeking through the drawn curtains.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>And Percy\u2019s drooling on Luke\u2019s shoulder.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Holy Hades!</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Percy scrambles backwards, almost falling off the sofa. Luke lifts his head and eyes him, looking bored.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Percy opens his mouth, but the only thing going through his head is </span>\n<em>\n<span>fuck fuck what the fuck</span>\n</em>\n<span> and </span>\n<em>\n<span>I can\u2019t believe I woke up alive</span>\n</em>\n<span> and also a lot of incoherent yelling. So, in the end, he doesn\u2019t say anything.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Luke smirks, but it doesn\u2019t last. He runs his hand through his hair. He seems tired.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThe gods are going to notice,\u201d he says quietly. Then he must see Percy\u2019s look of total confusion, because he adds, \u201cYour little house, Percy. It\u2019s a fool\u2019s errand.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Looks like they\u2019re just going to pretend that Percy wasn\u2019t just burrowed into Luke\u2019s side like a cat seeking warmth. Cool. Percy\u2019s down.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThat\u2019s weird,\u201d he tells Luke. \u201cIt\u2019s like you think they care.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Luke makes a face. \u201cI\u2019m just saying. This seems like a pretty shitty plan for Kronos.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Uh oh. Quick, um\u2014\u201cBecause his plan to have one demigod steal Zeus\u2019s Master Bolt while all the gods were meeting on Olympus was so much better,\u201d Percy says.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Luke glares. He looks like he regrets not smothering Percy in his sleep now.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>It would be more intimidating if he didn\u2019t still have that patch of drool on his shoulder.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Percy pretends to zip his lips.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>After a moment, Luke says, \u201cDedicating space to the minor gods will help the Hermes cabin\u2019s overcrowding problem a little, but it doesn\u2019t fix the fact that the undetermined still don\u2019t belong anywhere.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>You can get claimed and have your own cabin and still not belong, but Percy knows that\u2019s not what Luke\u2019s asking about. So, instead he shrugs and says, \u201cThen all we have to do is determine them.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Luke looks at him like he\u2019s the dumbest demigod on the planet. \u201cAnd how will we do that?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThe question isn\u2019t how we\u2019ll do it,\u201d Percy says. \u201cThe question is how Ethan will do it.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>For a moment, Luke just stares.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Then he collapses to one side, burying his face into the arm of the sofa. \u201cSomeday,\u201d he says, his voice muffled, \u201cyou\u2019re going to say something that actually makes sense.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cSomeday, you\u2019re gonna say something that doesn\u2019t make you sound like a total jerk,\u201d Percy grumbles.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI heard that.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Percy\u2019s about to respond with something that doesn\u2019t make him sound like he\u2019s actually twelve\u2014something that\u2019s not just \u201cSo what?\u201d\u2014but then there\u2019s a crashing sound from above deck.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>And the wind howls.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Luke lifts his head.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cDid you hear that, too?\u201d Percy whispers.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYeah,\u201d Luke says grimly. \u201cSomething\u2019s wrong.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u2014\u2014</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHurricane?\u201d Luke asks, squinting at the black clouds in the distance.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNo.\u201d But the storm looks familiar. Percy\u2019s seen this before. Where\u2014\u201dOh, hey,\u201d he realizes, \u201cit\u2019s Charybdis.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhat?\u201d Luke says, even though Percy knows he knows who Charybdis is. He\u2019s probably just confused because Percy pointed out Charybdis in the same way that you say \u201cOh, hey, it\u2019s the Statue of Liberty\u201d or \u201cOh, hey, it\u2019s my friend\u2019s weird aunt who works at Dollar General.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Percy nods. \u201cLooks like we finally found the Sea of Monsters.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cFound?!\u201d Luke says, rounding on Percy. \u201cYou mean you didn\u2019t know where you were going before? You\u2019re the son of Poseidon!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Percy crosses his arms and looks away. \u201cI know exactly where we are. I just\u2014didn\u2019t totally remember where everything else is. But I got it now,\u201d he adds quickly, since it looks like Luke would throw him overboard if he didn\u2019t know he could survive that just fine.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Hey, it\u2019s not Percy\u2019s fault that he can\u2019t remember the exact coordinates of Polyphemus\u2019 island. He still managed to sail them to the Sea of Monsters on this floating island of electronic garbage\u2014That has to count for something, right?</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Luke doesn\u2019t seem to think so. \u201cOkay,\u201d he says through gritted teeth. \u201cSo if you know exactly where we are, do you know how to steer us in exactly the right path so that we can actually get into the Sea of Monsters?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Percy shrugs. \u201cWe can just sail right through after Charybdis is gone.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Luke takes a couple moments to process that. Then he stares.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou want to kill Charybdis,\u201d he says slowly.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201c...Yeah? Better her than Scylla.\u201d At least in the water, Percy thinks he might stand a chance.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Luke gives Percy a look that says </span>\n<em>\n<span>I already knew you were crazy, but this is really pushing it.</span>\n</em>\n<span> Which is sort of offensive, considering that this is the guy who started a war and got himself possessed by a titan lord in order to say \u201cFuck you, dad.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Percy stares Luke down.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Luke looks out at the stormy sea, back at Percy, then down at his feet. He heaves a long sigh. Finally, he shakes his head and says, \u201cSure. Why not? Let\u2019s go.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Percy blinks. \u201cYou\u2019re coming with me?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Luke frowns. His eyes narrow. And then he snarls.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou think I\u2019m going to hold you back,\u201d he accuses.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhat?\u201d Percy says blankly. Then\u2014\u201cNo! Are you crazy? Have you ever looked at you and then looked at me?\u201d He waves his hand at Luke\u2019s\u2014everything, before gesturing back at himself.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Percy didn\u2019t think about this too much when he was actually twelve, but standing next to Luke does nothing for a guy\u2019s self esteem. Yeah, Percy got taller eventually, but he didn\u2019t look as fit as Luke does, and when it comes to sword fighting, they never truly got to compare. Either one of them was a kid at the time or the other had had his sword melted down and reforged into a scythe by the titan possessing his body. They really were like two sword fighting ships passing in the night.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Luke appears slightly mollified, but Percy can still see the tension in his jaw, the scars from years spent trying to get used to being pitied and underestimated and demeaned.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Percy turns away, gazing at Charybdis\u2019s faraway whirlpool. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to prove anything to me, Luke,\u201d he says. \u201cI just thought I\u2019d go alone because I can\u2019t drown, and it\u2019ll be easier for you to fish my body out of the water than it will be for me to get you.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>A pause. The roaring wind pushes the pool chairs across the deck with a cacophony of screeches.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Finally, Luke says, \u201cNo one\u2019s going to need to be fished out of the water if we do this right.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Percy whips his head around. \u201cYou have a plan?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYeah,\u201d Luke says, his expression relaxed again. Then he raises an eyebrow. \u201cYou don\u2019t?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cUh.\u201d Percy hesitates. \u201cStab her until she dies?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Luke looks like he really wants to put his head in his hands.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou use the water to restrict Charybdis\u2019s movements and keep her from submerging,\u201d he tells Percy, \u201cso I can get in close and \u2018stab her until she dies.\u2019\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cSounds good,\u201d Percy nods. \u201cBut, how are you going to\u2026\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Luke\u2019s already tying on his flying sneakers.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou got the blood off!\u201d Percy says.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYeah.\u201d Luke straightens up and smirks. \u201cYour toothbrush was very helpful.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Before Percy can react, Luke calls \u201cMaia!\u201d and shoots off towards the oncoming storm.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cMy toothbrush?\u201d Percy yells after him. \u201cLuke? Luke?! Fine! We\u2019ll revisit this conversation once we finish kicking monster butt!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Percy grabs a lifeboat and throws both it and him over the deck, pulling the waves forward so that he\u2019s moving at the speed of a pegasus. The lifeboat isn\u2019t Percy\u2019s favorite combat vehicle, but he\u2019s never tried walking on water, and now is not a good time to figure out if he actually can.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>By the time Percy reaches the edge of the whirlpool, Luke\u2019s already swooping around Charybdis\u2019s open mouth, scanning for vulnerable spots and weaknesses. He seems very grossed out by her clogged braces.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>If Percy had had his way, Luke wouldn\u2019t be within a mile of Charybdis\u2019s teeth. Still, he\u2019s kind of glad he\u2019s not the one who has to play orthodontist. He gets to wrestle control of the tide from an ancient monster who Odysseus barely survived instead.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Fun.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Percy stands up and clenches his teeth. Then he reaches for the ocean.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>It\u2019s like playing tug of war with a giant, except the rope is his guts. It\u2019s like holding up the sky again but sideways, so the force is pressing his rib cage into his lungs. But, it\u2019s fine. It\u2019s totally fine. Percy can do this. He\u2019s actually held up the sky before, and that hadn\u2019t even been the worst part of his day.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The whirlpool slows, then calms completely, fading into the normal rocking of the waves. Charabdis\u2019s mouth remains gaping open as she sucks and gasps like a fish drowning on air.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI think that\u2019s the best I can do!\u201d Percy calls breathlessly.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Luke flashes him an okay sign before raising Backbiter and diving into Charybdis\u2019s maw, disappearing completely from Percy\u2019s line of sight.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Percy tells himself to breathe, slow and even, and he does his best to ignore the part of his brain that\u2019s screaming </span>\n<em>\n<span>You just let Charybdis eat Luke! How are you going to explain this to Annabeth?!</span>\n</em>\n<span>\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Luke\u2019s doing just fine. Percy can tell, because each time he lands a blow, Charybdis thrashes, and then Percy has to focus really hard on calming the new waves so that none of the water makes it into her mouth.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Ugh.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>How long does it take to stab a huge sea monster until she dies?</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>After what feels like an eternity, Percy can\u2019t take it anymore. \u201cHurry up!\u201d he screams.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Luke flies out between Charybdis\u2019s molars just so he can glare. \u201cIt\u2019s not that easy!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>He says that, but Percy can see the half-grin on his face, the sweat slicking his hair back, the relaxed grip he has on Backbiter\u2019s bloody hilt. Percy knows what Luke looks like when he\u2019s toying with his enemy.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Luke\u2019s taking his time. He\u2019s enjoying this.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Percy\u2019s arms are shaking. \u201cLuke?\u201d he asks.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cStay where you are, Percy. Don\u2019t get in my way.\u201d And then Luke goes back to\u2014to taking out his repressed anger on Charybdis\u2019s gums.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Percy wants to throw up. He wants to lie down. He wants to go home and hug a hot water bottle to his stomach and let his mom brush his hair away from his face and sit with him, like she always does when he\u2019s sick.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>He\u2019s tired. He wants to be with someone who cares about him, since Luke apparently doesn\u2019t.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>This battle needs to finish now. Percy carefully turns his attention to the water sloshing inside Charybdis\u2019s throat\u2014His lifeboat jerks to the side\u2014and he thinks hard about spears. Whaling harpoons.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>He brings his hand up sharply.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Charybdis lurches, and Luke yelps.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHey!\u201d he says. \u201cI told you\u2014stay out of this!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou\u2019re. Being. Too. Slow!\u201d Percy bites out, punctuating each word with another slash of his arm.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The ocean rocks around him as Charybdis moans. The lifeboat almost tips over, and Percy staggers.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cShut up and follow my\u2014Shit!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Charybdis flails.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Luke\u2019s sentence cuts off.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Fuck.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cLuke!\u201d Percy screams. He forces the choppy waves to push him closer and closer to Charybdis\u2019s open mouth, searching for a glint of gold hair, the shine of Backbiter\u2019s blade.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>But, there\u2019s nothing but sea and sky and darkness.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Oh no.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Come on, really? Like this? Is this for real\u2014</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>That can\u2019t be\u2014</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>But, maybe it\u2019s better\u2014</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>No, shut up, no. No, no, no, nonononononono\u2014</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>It\u2019s his fault. Why is he always so\u2014</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Charybdis makes a gargling noise as Luke blasts into the air, his sword twirling, his face furious. There\u2019s seaweed on his head. He\u2019s bleeding from a puncture wound on his calf.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Percy\u2019s never seen a more beautiful man in his life.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou,\u201d Luke sputters, so angry that he can\u2019t even speak. \u201cYou\u2014\u201d Then his eyes widen. \u201cPercy, don\u2019t let go of\u2014\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The rest of his words are lost when Percy\u2019s lifeboat capsizes.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Percy probably hits his head on some driftwood or a shark or something, because by the time he\u2019s done processing </span>\n<em>\n<span>Luke\u2019s alive! Thank all the gods</span>\n</em>\n<span> and </span>\n<em>\n<span>I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m happy that Luke\u2019s alive</span>\n</em>\n<span> and </span>\n<em>\n<span>I lost control of the whirlpool</span>\n</em>\n<span>, he\u2019s floating in complete darkness, buffeted by the storm of debris swirling around him.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>He\u2019s...inside Charybdis\u2019s mouth.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Wow. That was really stupid, wasn\u2019t it?</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Just as Percy\u2019s reaching into the black, trying to figure out if he\u2019s in danger of being impaled any time soon, he hears someone say, </span>\n<em>\n<span>Mother told me you would come.</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>At first, he thinks it\u2019s one of the sharks\u2014maybe he hit one on the head as hard as it hit him\u2014but then he realizes that the voice is vibrating through the water, coming from everywhere around him. Everywhere.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Charybdis?</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<span>I was once Father\u2019s favorite child, too, you know, </span>\n</em>\n<span>she tells him.</span>\n<em>\n<span> I was beautiful, powerful. Under my hand, the sea swallowed so much land that Zeus made me a monster in fear that we would conquer all.\u00a0</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Mother? Father?</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Oh, gross, wasn\u2019t one of them enough\u2014</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<span>Father doesn\u2019t like monsters as much,</span>\n</em>\n<span> Charybdis says sadly.</span>\n<em>\n<span> So now I only retain the hungry tide. What do you think he\u2019ll leave for you, faithless brother?</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>It\u2019s getting colder. Charybdis must be diving. But why\u2014</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<span>I bet Mother will be happy to see you, though.</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Mother.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>No. Nope, no. Percy refuses. He can\u2019t. Ignoring the rocks and wood and fish crashing into his arms, Percy calls upon the sea and tries to press his way out of Charybdis\u2019s throat, tries to cut through her, burst her open.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>But, nothing happens. The water might as well be concrete.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Shit.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Is this favoritism? This is favoritism, isn\u2019t it? Maybe Percy should\u2019ve been burning his blue jelly beans\u2014</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>No, that\u2019s not helpful, Percy. How did they defeat Charybdis last time? Tyson was there, and so was Clarisse, because they were all on the creepy Confederate steamboat Ares had given her\u2014</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Is it because Charybdis was turned into a monster against her will, and Percy\u2014</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Shut up, shut up, shut up! They didn\u2019t defeat Charybdis last time, stupid! They never did. They barely even got away. If the engines hadn\u2019t overheated\u2014</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Wait.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>That\u2019s it.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Percy thinks hard about light. Warmth. Fire and explosions and Mount Saint Helens erupting at his back. Steam. Please, let it all turn into steam.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Luke is waiting above. Annabeth and Grover and his mom are waiting back home. They still need him, the di Angelos still need him, Camp Half-Blood still needs him. And\u2014and Percy doesn\u2019t want to go into the cold and dark again.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Warmth. Please.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<span>Ever since she came back, it\u2019s just been Percy Jackson this, Percy Jackson that, Percy Jackson says that Devil\u2019s Ivy will instantly bring life to the drakon swamp, but\u2014What are you doing? What\u2014No! Stop! You\u2019re burning m\u2014</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Please.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Percy wakes up feeling like he\u2019s gone a hundred rounds with the Minotaur. His body can\u2019t seem to decide if it\u2019s freezing or feverish, so he\u2019s shivering as he sweats, and it\u2019s making him ache.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>He blinks up at the ceiling and tries to decide if being conscious is worth it.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cFinally,\u201d Luke says.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Percy tilts his\u2014ow\u2014head up. Luke looks down at him expressionlessly from where he\u2019s leaning against the headboard of the bed. Which means that the soft thing Percy\u2019s lying on must also be the bed.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>What\u2026?</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Something nudges against his lips. It\u2019s Luke\u2019s water bottle. \u201cYou\u2019re on the </span>\n<em>\n<span>Princess Andromeda,\u201d</span>\n</em>\n<span> Luke tells him, as he pours water into his mouth. \u201cWe made it into the Sea of Monsters. After Charybdis swallowed you, she never resurfaced. It\u2019s been a day since I had to fish your body out of the ocean, and you\u2019re an idiot who\u2019s incapable of following the simplest order. Anything else?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Ouch. Percy coughs, choking. Once Luke withdraws the water bottle, he clears his throat and asks, \u201cAre you okay?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Luke snorts. \u201cNo thanks to you.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Percy\u2019s chest feels tight. Luke has dark circles under his eyes. He must\u2019ve packed some ambrosia squares, because the wound on his calf is healed over. The new skin is shiny and pink.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>It\u2019s the wrong shape for a bite mark.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Percy whispers.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Luke glances away, lips pressed tightly together. Percy closes his eyes.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>This trip is a disaster. Percy got swallowed by a sea monster, almost shish kabobed Luke, t\u2014did something </span>\n<em>\n<span>really bad</span>\n</em>\n<span> to some really bad people, went shopping in Soho, and all he\u2019s learned is that he still can\u2019t let Luke live, and he still can\u2019t let Luke die.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>He really is bad at this, isn\u2019t he?</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Luke could ask for that duel to the death right now, and Percy honestly wouldn\u2019t blame him.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>But, Percy must look truly pathetic because instead of storming away or yelling or grabbing Backbiter and chopping his head off, Luke just says, \u201cI figured out how to operate the bridge and docked us at an island. It looks like some sort of tropical paradise.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Whoa, does this mean Percy could\u2019ve been making Luke sail the stupid yacht this entire time?</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Wait. Did he just say tropical paradise?</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Percy pushes himself\u2014ow, ow, ow\u2014up and off the bed. Then his knees decide that now is a good time to mutiny, so he\u2019s left half slumped on the mattress, kneeling on the ground.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cPercy?\u201d Luke says. He sounds alarmed.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cFine, I\u2019m fine,\u201d Percy says. He sits himself all the way down on the floor. The floor\u2019s a nice place anyway. Why doesn\u2019t he spend more time on the floor? Fumbling in his pocket for Riptide, Percy asks, \u201cDo you have some paper?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Luke pauses halfway through his circuit towards Percy\u2019s part of the floor. He eyes Percy like he\u2019s a rabid hellhound and says, \u201c...Why?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Percy uncaps his sword, tries to ignore how Luke tenses and steps back, then taps the cap on the hilt, transforming Riptide back into a pen. \u201cI need to take some notes.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>A pause. Luke opens his mouth, then closes it again, like he doesn\u2019t know if he\u2019s more confused by Percy\u2019s pen or his words.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>In the end, he just says, \u201cYou need to take notes. Here. On this random island.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Percy nods, then immediately stops nodding because it\u2019s making his head spin. \u201cKronos really wants some detailed drawings of this random island\u2019s, uh, plants. And stuff.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Luke takes a deep breath, holds it for three seconds, then exhales. He does this a couple more times, looking like he\u2019s doing his very best to find his happy place. Percy wonders if that\u2019s where he satisfies his inner desire to viciously beat up Hermes.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Finally\u2014\u201cFine,\u201d Luke says lightly. He walks over to the nightstand and pulls one of those little hotel notepads out of the single drawer. Percy can see that it has Andromeda\u2019s terrified face printed at the bottom instead of a logo, which is just great.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Luke holds the notepad above Percy\u2019s head. Percy lifts his\u2014ow\u2014arm and finds that the tip of his middle finger just barely brushes the cardboard backing.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHey,\u201d Percy says, wiggling his fingers.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Luke glances down at him, the corners of his lips curling up. \u201cNo nature drawing unless you can stand. I\u2019m not going to carry you all over the place.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Wow. Okay, be that way then. Percy already knew that Luke was just hiding his inner evil deep, deep down.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>With a lot of cursing, grumbling, and pushing off the wall, Percy manages to move himself into a standing position with minimal pain, since he\u2019s now distracted by the headache caused by the realization that Luke must have carried him to bed like he was a total baby.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Luke taps him on the forehead with the notepad before Percy snatches it away and stumbles towards the door.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Using his palm as a desk, Percy writes down \u201cCaldecott Tunnel - Oakland Hills, San Francisco, CA, USA\u201d as neatly as he can while using his stupid shaky hand, shuffling to the lower deck, and keeping the notepad away from Luke, who\u2019s shadowing him from two feet away.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Wait. That\u2019s not going to work.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Percy whirls around, almost trips over his own feet, and has to be steadied by Luke\u2019s hand on his arm. Embarrassed, he straightens up immediately, hiding the notepad behind his back. \u201cWhy are you following me?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Luke shrugs. \u201cKronos wants something here. I\u2019m allied with Kronos.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Whoa, hey, Percy\u2019s the only one allowed to use Kronos-shaped excuses around here.\u00a0 \u201cLuke,\u201d he says seriously. And he\u2019s probably still kind of delirious from boiling himself in the world\u2019s grossest pressure cooker, because he puts his hands on Luke\u2019s shoulders, whacking him in the cheek with the notepad, and yanks until Luke is at eye level. \u201cLuke,\u201d Percy says, patting him on the cheek with his non-notebook hand. \u201cI need you to tell me something. Do you secretly want to spend the rest of your life as a guinea pig?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhat?\u201d Luke says.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cDo you like celery? Have you ever tried being a vegetarian but just needed one last push to commit? Deep, deep down, do you want to become a guinea pig?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>A pause.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Luke stares, wide-eyed.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201c...No?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Satisfied, Percy says, \u201cThen don\u2019t follow me.\u201d He pats Luke on the cheek one last time before sprinting for the gangway.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>No time for doubt. Percy leans over the railing and calls, \u201cExcuse me?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYes?\u201d says the placidly smiling lady with the clipboard.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Even with the blue business suit, tight ponytail, and perfect makeup, there\u2019s no denying her resemblance to the Amazon queen who had it out for him for years. \u201cAre you Hylla Ram\u00edrez-Arellano?\u201d Percy asks.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Hylla\u2019s smile goes stiff. \u201cWhere did you learn that name?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIf Reyna ever gets tired of combing hair on a magical island, tell her to go to this address,\u201d Percy tosses the notepad onto the boardwalk. Hylla jumps back, staring at it like it\u2019s a dead rat.\u00a0 \u201cIt\u2019s a refuge for demigods. She can go to school and train and make friends her own age. She\u2019ll be safe there.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWho are you?\u201d Hylla says, pulling out her dagger. \u201cHow do you know Reyna?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Yup, time to go. \u201cI know you want to protect her,\u201d Percy says quickly, backing away from the railing, \u201cbut she should have a choice.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Percy runs back to the door and slams straight into Luke.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhat is going o\u2014\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cStop!\u201d Hylla yells. She sounds like an Amazon queen already. Percy can almost feel the traumatic flashbacks coming on. \u201cAttendants!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNo time to explain.\u201d Percy spins Luke back around and shoves him in the direction of the bridge. He doesn\u2019t think Luke would eat any of his dad\u2019s fun multivitamins even if Hermes did show up with a bottle, and Percy really, really can\u2019t spend the rest of his life as a guinea pig.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Though that would be a fitting conclusion to the practical joke that is his life.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Nope, this is not the time! Percy pushes Luke harder. \u201cGo, go, go, go\u2014\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u2014\u2014</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>After their quick stop at C.C.\u2019s Spa and Resort, Luke can\u2019t seem to decide if Percy was hallucinating from fever or just plain fucking with him. Percy doesn\u2019t care either way, because Luke apparently concludes that the appropriate response to both these possibilities is enforced bedrest.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Yeah. And Luke is taking the \u201cenforced\u201d part really seriously.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>He tries tying Percy\u2019s wrists to the bedpost with a towel before giving up on that idea, probably because Percy kicked him in the nuts during the attempt. Then he settles on rolling Percy into a blanket and tucking him under the sheets very, very tightly.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cGet up, and I\u2019ll flush the rest of your jelly beans down the toilet.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t dare.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>After a mistimed escape attempt, Percy learns that Luke does indeed dare.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>It\u2019s tragic. Percy almost calls for a duel to the death right then and there.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Eventually, once they\u2019ve both survived another incident involving the M&amp;Ms, Luke\u2019s non-flying shoes, and better timing on Percy\u2019s part, Luke just starts locking Percy in the stateroom. Apparently, he doesn\u2019t need a key to lock or unlock doors.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>And that\u2019s fine. Percy doesn\u2019t mind being locked in a room he once had nightmares about. He can keep the curtains closed. It\u2019s totally fine.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>While Percy\u2019s wasting away in time out, Luke sails the </span>\n<em>\n<span>Princess Andromeda</span>\n</em>\n<span>. Every hour, he\u2019ll come ask Percy if he\u2019s going in the right direction, but otherwise he handles operating the giant hunk of floating garbage on his own. And Percy will never tell him this, but he\u2019s not half bad at it.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Maybe, when this is all over, Luke will retire from evil and become a cruise ship captain. Percy tries to picture it and then immediately stops trying to picture it. He can\u2019t tell if that image is the product of a fever dream or a new nightmare.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Either way, once Percy gets out of here, he\u2019s going to have to convince Luke to teach him the normal person way to sail. Yeah, he can control the ship without ever touching a button, but, well, the more you know, right?</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Right. Percy can\u2019t rely on his power over water for everything. Maybe he shouldn\u2019t be relying on it at all.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>No, wait, stupid thought. How\u2019s he gonna do anything without water? The ocean, on the other hand\u2014</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Okay, for real, just stop. On a cruise ship with a guy who might still want to murder him (possibly?) is not a good place to make this decision. Maybe Percy just...needs a little time. More time.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>It\u2019s fine. He\u2019s not a monster. Not a monster. Not a monster.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Anyway, bedrest is boring, even when Percy\u2019s so achy that he doesn\u2019t want to fight his way out of Luke\u2019s blanket burrito the second he leaves the room. Eventually, once Percy gets tired of sleeping, he rolls out of bed and uncaps Riptide. Luke can take his jelly beans, but he can\u2019t take his pockets, and Percy needs to practice fighting somewhere with a ceiling. After he lands a killing blow on the sofa, he decides that that\u2019s probably enough sword fighting training for now. Artfully rearranging the sofa cushions takes up a little more time, but then Percy finds himself trying to figure out the best way to shatter the windows and free himself from this hellhole.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Sometimes he thinks he can see a glint of gold out of the corner of his eye. It\u2019s driving him crazy.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Hey, wait, is that Luke\u2019s backpack? Did Luke leave his backpack here?</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>...Percy has an idea.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOkay, give it another try.\u2019</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Ethan stares two inches to the right of the mirror, dead-eyed. With all the passion of a middle school news anchor reading off a teleprompter, he says, \u201cI am Ethan Nakamura, son of Nemesis, and she hath bestoweth upon me the power to shame those who have wronged her by inflicting their children upon them. Step forward, and with mine eye, I shall\u2014\u201c</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhat is going on in here?\u201d Luke says.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cEvil,\u201d Percy says, while at the same time Ethan deadpans, \u201cTorture.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cEvil torture,\u201d Percy amends agreeably. He hops up from the floor and runs to Luke, handing him the mirror while trying not to be too obvious about slipping towards the door.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cLuke,\u201d Ethan nods. \u201cI like the new arts and crafts projects. Silena told me I have you and Percy to thank for that.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Luke grabs the collar of Percy\u2019s shirt before he can make it into the hallway. \u201cRight,\u201d Luke says. \u201cThe projects.\u201d He pauses, then adds, \u201cEthan, you should know that we\u2019re not just\u2014\u201c</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHey, Ethan,\u201d Percy says loudly. \u201cWe should totally show Luke what we\u2019ve been working on.\u201d He tells Luke, \u201cEthan\u2019s fixed the undetermined camper problem.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Luke raises an eyebrow. He still hasn\u2019t let go of Percy\u2019s shirt.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cDo I have to?\u201d Ethan says. He sounds like he\u2019d be whining if he didn\u2019t consider it beneath his dignity.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYes,\u201d Percy nods insistently, even as he tries to untangle Luke\u2019s fingers. \u201cBut, maybe try putting a little more, uh, emotion in it this time.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Ethan takes a deep breath. He gazes up at the sky, like he\u2019s begging his mom for mercy. Then he recites, in a complete monotone, \u201cI am Ethan Nakamura, son of Nemesis, and she hath bestoweth\u2014\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNo, that\u2019s fine, Ethan,\u201d Luke interrupts. \u201cI\u2019ve already heard\u2014enough.\u201d He turns to Percy, shaking him gently by the collar. \u201cAre you planning on convincing the gods to claim their kids through second-hand embarrassment? Because if they don\u2019t care about how their kids live or die, I don\u2019t think\u2014\u201c</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWe\u2019re not trying to make the gods claim their kids,\u201d Percy explains. \u201cWe\u2019re just gonna tell their kids who their godly parent is.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Luke looks like he\u2019d be rubbing his temple if his hands weren\u2019t full. \u201cHow do you know who their parents are?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cEthan\u2019s eye knows all,\u201d Percy says mysteriously, at the same time that Ethan says, \u201cPercy has a list.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cA list?\u201d Luke\u2019s eyes narrow.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Ah, shit. \u201cEthan!\u201d Percy says. \u201cI told you not to tell!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Ethan rolls his eyes. \u201cYou didn\u2019t tell me not to tell. You told me not to ask where it came from.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIt was implied!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Luke\u2019s jaw is tense again. He\u2019s definitely going to have teeth problems by the end of this trip. \u201cWe\u2019ll contact you later, Ethan.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cPractice your speech!\u201d Percy calls, right before Luke closes the connection. \u201cTraitor,\u201d he mumbles.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Luke spins Percy around and slams him into the wall, pinning him there with a forearm across his neck. So this is where Annabeth gets it from.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Luke leans forward, drawing Percy\u2019s attention back. \u201cA list?\u201d he asks.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYeah,\u201d Percy says, staring at the air over Luke\u2019s right shoulder. \u201cKronos told me who everyone\u2019s parents are. He\u2019s a real family guy once you get to know him.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Silence. Luke seems to be considering the pros and cons of trying to shake all of Percy\u2019s secrets out of him.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Percy tugs at Luke\u2019s wrist. \u201cSo\u2026am I done with bedrest now?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Luke blinks, realizes that he\u2019s a quarter inch away from choking Percy out, and abruptly lets him go. Percy rubs his throat, eyeing the half-open door. Luke looks away.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI\u2019m going to go train,\u201d he says, striding into the hallway.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Freedom! And just in time. Percy glances at the stairway to the aft deck. He hasn\u2019t been outside in so long...But\u2014Percy trots after Luke, asking, \u201cAgain? Don\u2019t you do anything else?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Luke ignores him.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Percy zips around Luke, forcing him to either trip or stop. \u201cHey, if you want to serve Kronos, you can\u2019t just train. You also have to learn how to work with other people.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI don\u2019t want to serve Kronos,\u201d Luke says. \u201cI want to bring down the gods.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAnd I\u2019m sure that fighting the mall mannequins is helping you a lot with that, but I have something better for you to do.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Luke stares up at the ceiling. He looks like he\u2019d be praying for patience if he still believed in the gods. \u201cYou really are a little brat, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI prefer pain in the ass, thanks,\u201d Percy says. Then he grabs Luke\u2019s hand and starts pulling him towards the staircase.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u2014\u2014</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNo,\u201d Luke says. \u201cWhat? No!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI know this is a big step in our relationship\u2014\u201c Percy coaxes.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThere is no relationship! We don\u2019t have a relationship!\u201d Luke points at Percy and says, \u201cI am not talking to your mom.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Fine, they can do this the hard way. Percy crosses his arms and tells Luke, \u201cThis is an order from Kronos.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>If possible, Luke looks even more freaked out. \u201cKronos wants me to meet your mom?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHey,\u201d Percy says, \u201cmy mom\u2019s awesome. And Kronos says that moms are important. If he didn\u2019t have his mom\u2019s help, he wouldn\u2019t have been able to chop his father up into tiny little pieces or throw his dick into the sea.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Not that Percy\u2019s trying to drown any dicks or chop anyone up into little pieces (right now?). He just wants to see what his mom thinks of Luke. He trusts her judgment, and he needs to make sure that this growing attachment isn\u2019t just some kind of Stockholm syndrome that you get when you\u2019re stuck in a cruise ship with only your mortal enemy for company. If she can see what Percy sees in Luke, too, then...then something. Percy hasn\u2019t totally figured that part out yet.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>But he knows it\u2019s important.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cPercy\u2014\u201d Luke starts.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAlso, it\u2019s my birthday,\u201d Percy says, \u201cand you owe me a birthday present.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou can\u2019t know if it\u2019s your birthday,\u201d Luke argues. \u201cWe don\u2019t know what day it is. Time moves differently in places where\u2014\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Yeah, yeah. \u201cPresent.\u201d Percy sticks out his hand. \u201cMore jelly beans will work. Or we I-M my mom. Or,\u201d he adds, \u201cI\u2019ll tell on you to Kronos.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Luke gives Percy a look that says </span>\n<em>\n<span>Are you thirteen or are you three?</span>\n</em>\n<span>\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Percy gives Luke a look that says </span>\n<em>\n<span>The only way you\u2019re getting out of this is if you jump off this ship, and even then, I\u2019ll figure out a way to haul you back up.</span>\n</em>\n<span> At least Percy hopes it says that. These sorts of looks usually involve a lot of eyebrow. Percy\u2019s not great with his eyebrows.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Luke stares out at the sea, clearly considering his options.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Percy frowns. He knows Luke flushed all the jelly beans. Does he really care so little about what Kronos does to him, or is he just allergic to moms?</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Neither option is good.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cFine,\u2019 Luke sighs. \u201cI\u2019ll do the I-M.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cGreat!\u201d Percy says. Then he ponders the sparkling fountains for a moment. \u201cDo you think we can set those up so it looks like we\u2019re underwater?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Luke pinches the bridge of his nose. \u201cWhy do we need to look like we\u2019re underwater?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cSo we can pretend that we\u2019re in the canoe lake.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201c...Is that what you were doing in the lake all summer? I-Ming your mom?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Percy pleads the fifth.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The underwater background doesn\u2019t happen, but Percy thinks he can pass off the outside of the cruise ship as a weirdly shaped cabin, as long as they don\u2019t stand near the railing. Using the drachma he snuck out of Luke\u2019s backpack, he starts the I-M, trying not to get too nervous about saying his mom\u2019s address in front of Luke.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>And it seems like his mom\u2019s been waiting for him to call, since she\u2019s yelling even before the connection is stable.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201c\u2014cy Jackson! Do you have any idea how worried I\u2019ve be\u2014\u201d She cuts herself off as soon as her eyes fall on Luke, who shifts uncomfortably.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Percy clears his throat. \u201cHi, Mom. Sorry I missed last Saturday.\u201d He grabs the hem of Luke\u2019s shirt and tugs until he\u2019s standing a bit closer. \u201cThis is my friend Luke.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAh,\u201d his mom says. She\u2019s glancing between them, wide-eyed. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to meet you, Luke.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cMa\u2019am,\u201d Luke says stiffly.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Silence.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>So. This is awkward.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Percy looks at his mom, trying to ask </span>\n<em>\n<span>What\u2019s wrong?</span>\n</em>\n<span> with his eyes. She\u2019s never been this quiet with someone he\u2019s introduced as a friend before.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Is it because Luke\u2019s so far gone that she can tell he\u2019s evil without him saying more than one word to her?</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Percy\u2019s heart starts going cold.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cUh,\u201d he says, floundering. \u201cI know I haven\u2019t called in a while, but I\u2019ve been busy with, um, camp things.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cRight. Camp things,\u201d his mom hesitates. Then she asks, \u201cDarling, are you alright? Is\u2014Did something happen? I got a call from Chiron...\u201d She trails off, quickly glancing at Luke again before giving Percy a meaningful look.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhat?\u201d Percy says.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Luke tenses.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Then Percy realizes\u2014</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201dOh my g\u2014No, Mom, he didn\u2019t\u2014\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>As Percy sputters, he can see his mom relax a little, though her brow is still creased with concern.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Percy can\u2019t believe Chiron got his mom involved! Okay, he can believe it, but that was so not cool, man! So not cool.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Even though Percy\u2019s been I-Ming his mom all summer, he\u2019s never told her about what he\u2019s really been doing. And he\u2019s never going to. He knows it\u2019s unfair to her. He knows that his mom\u2019s the only person whose life he\u2019s definitely going to make worse, after everything is over. But, what choice does he have?</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>She\u2019s his mom. And she\u2019s a good mom. And he\u2019s not an easy kid. And\u2014And as long as she knows that he\u2019s out there somewhere, she\u2019ll never stop worrying about him.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<span>I\u2019m telling you we have to go up! My son\u2014</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>That\u2019s going to kill her someday.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>These IMs are Percy\u2019s way of spending time with her, using what little time he can spare. Soon he won\u2019t have any. Yes, he knows it\u2019s cruel. But, what choice does he have? Her life will be sadder, but at least she\u2019ll have one.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>He wants to be there with her so badly.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>No time. His mom will be able to tell if he\u2019s lying, so Percy gives her a half-truth. \u201cI wasn\u2019t\u2014doing great, after the whole Underworld thing,\u201d he explains. He\u2019s still holding onto Luke\u2019s shirt, just in case he tries bolting away in mortification. \u201cAnd camp\u2019s nice and all, but it gets a little\u2014I just needed to blow off some steam, so I, um, I sort of ran off without telling anyone?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cPercy!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cSorry, Mom. But it\u2019s okay. Luke followed me and talked to me, and he got us a boat, so now we\u2019re doing some sailing before we head back. Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019m feeling a lot better. Luke\u2019s the sword fighting instructor at camp, and he\u2019s been teaching me how to kick monster butt!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Percy feels like he\u2019s laying it on pretty thick, but his mom seems cheered by his enthusiasm. She turns a smile on Luke, who makes a face like he\u2019s staring down Medusa.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOh\u2014\u201d Luke stutters. \u201cUh, I haven\u2019t really\u2014\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>After another couple seconds of incoherency, Percy\u2019s mom takes pity on him and says, \u201cThank you, Luke. I\u2019m glad to hear that Percy\u2019s found such a good role model.\u201d Percy swallows his snort. Luke goes kind of green. \u201cYou should come over for dinner the next time you\u2019re free.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Luke blanks. It\u2019s like he\u2019s never heard of dinner before.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Percy nods, adding, \u201cMy mom makes the best meatloaf in the state.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>And it appears that her urge to make Luke into that meatloaf evaporated completely after Percy explained that Luke had not, in fact, kidnapped him. It\u2019s a relief to know that Luke isn\u2019t giving her bad vibes. No one\u2019s going to survive this if Percy\u2019s judgment is that terrible.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOh! That reminds me\u2014\u201d His mom walks out of view. There\u2019s the sound of the fridge opening and closing, and then she comes back with a blue cupcake covered with blue frosting. \u201cHappy birthday, baby. I can\u2019t believe you\u2019re already thirteen. It feels like I was giving you bubble baths just yesterday.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cMom!\u201d Percy complains. Not the bathtime stories again!\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Then there\u2019s a candle and some singing, and Luke still standing there awkwardly, his expression caught between discomfort and longing. Percy still won\u2019t let go of his shirt.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAre you really gonna eat my birthday cake in front of me?\u201d Percy says sadly.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>His mom takes a huge bite. There\u2019s frosting on her nose. \u201cWell,\u201d she says through a mouthful of cake, \u201cyou did go missing this year, so I think I deserve it.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Percy makes his eyes big and pathetic. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Mom.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>She continues sending him a stern look until he adds in an exaggerated pout, and then she breaks, laughing. Then she turns to Luke and says, \u201cYou really should come over and visit, Luke. I\u2019ll bake you a thank you cake. We can eat it in front of Percy together.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Luke blinks, then cracks a grin. It softens his entire face. \u201cI\u2019m looking forward to it,\u201d he says.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Percy groans. \u201cI never should\u2019ve introduced you two.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cPercy\u2019s always been easily embarrassed, but he used to blush more. It was a lot of fun, actually,\u201d his mom confesses to Luke. \u201cThere was this one time when he was four\u2014\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cSo, Mom,\u201d Percy interrupts loudly, \u201chow\u2019s your writing class going?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>As his mom talks about journaling, the short stories she\u2019s been reading, and this classmate she\u2019s becoming friendly with, Luke nods and makes affirmative noises. When she mentions her GED, he asks about how her admissions process went, and then they\u2019re talking about extracurriculars and requirements and how prepared she feels compared to the other students. They both seem pleased to have someone to talk to about this.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Percy slowly loosens his grip until he\u2019s let go entirely. Luke doesn\u2019t run.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u2014\u2014</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>After they finish the call, Luke shoots Percy an extremely confused look before he shuts himself in the stateroom, probably to sort out all the warm and fuzzy feelings Percy\u2019s mom has infected him with. She\u2019s good at stuff like that.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Percy goes to the bridge and curls up on the captain\u2019s chair, staring out at the sea. He thinks about his mom and the blue cupcake that was waiting in the fridge. He thinks about the empty apartment, still freshly de-Gabe-ed. He thinks a lot about the people he\u2019s left back home. Maybe that\u2019s why he dreams of Camp Half-Blood when he falls asleep.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The first thing he sees is Annabeth, aggressively slamming clay onto a pottery wheel in the Arts &amp; Crafts Center. Grover hovers over her, looking on nervously.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThe Oracle still won\u2019t give you a prophecy?\u201d he says.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNo,\u201d Annabeth grunts. She punches the clay twice, rattling the wheel. \u201cI I-Med Chiron, and he said\u2014Well, you saw the penthouse.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYeah. All that blood\u2026\u201d Grover shudders. He hesitates, before continuing, \u201cAnnabeth, you don\u2019t think Luke and Percy\u2026\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Annabeth whips her head around, glaring. \u201cDon\u2019t say stuff like that,\u201d she bites out. \u201cThey\u2019re fine. I bet Percy just got worked up over a lost dog flyer, and then Luke followed him to keep him out of trouble.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Hey! Percy\u2019s not that bad, is he?</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYeah,\u201d Grover says. \u201cMaybe.\u201d Then his eyes widen. \u201cThat\u2019s it!\u201d he exclaims.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhat?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cLost! He went looking for someone who\u2019s lost!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cGrover.\u201d Annabeth stands up, grabs Grover\u2019s shoulders, and shakes, getting wet clay all over his shirt. \u201cYou better start making some sense right now, or I swear I\u2019ll\u2014\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cPan!\u201d Grover bleats. \u201cPercy asked me not to go looking for Pan over the summer, because he had to take care of something first. I bet that wherever Luke and Percy went, it has something to do with Pan.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Oh no. Come on, man. Percy really understands why loose lips sink ships now.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Annabeth\u2019s eyes light up. \u201cSo if we go looking for Pan\u2014\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201c\u2014we might be able to find them,\u201d Grover finishes.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cDo you think you can\u2014\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI\u2019ll tell the Council of Elders tomorrow. They weren\u2019t happy when I had to delay anyway, so they\u2019ll definitely approve. But, Annabeth, if the Oracle won\u2019t give you a prophecy\u2026\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI know,\u201d Annabeth nods grimly. \u201cI\u2019ll figure something out.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Just when Percy\u2019s about to try yelling at the people in his dreams again\u2014Because what if it actually works this time?\u2014he glimpses a shadow moving at the door and hears\u2014</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou don\u2019t need a prophecy.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Annabeth jolts. Grover shrieks.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cClarisse?\u201d Annabeth says. And it is her, looking angry and grim, with a pale cast to her face that Percy doesn\u2019t remember her having at this age. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI\u2019m leaving camp tomorrow,\u201d Clarisse says, \u201ceven if the Oracle isn\u2019t giving out prophecies anymore.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d Grover begins. Annabeth cuts him off with a raised hand. \u201cWhy?\u201d she asks instead.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Clarisse presses her lips together. \u201cMy father gave me a steamship. And a mission.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>That\u2019s weird. She doesn\u2019t look excited at all. She\u2019s not even gloating.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Annabeth obviously senses the same wrongness that Percy does. Her voice is quiet and careful when she says, \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Clarisse swallows, looking down at the rattled pottery wheel.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cKill Percy Jackson.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Percy spills out of the chair, awake even before he hits the ground.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>He stares up at the ceiling and breathes.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Later, Percy will worry about Annabeth and Grover trying to make it to the Sea of Monsters on their own, Clarisse coming to assassinate him on Ares\u2019s word, the clash of these two quests with his own and the danger his friends don\u2019t even know they\u2019re heading towards.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>But, right now, lying spread-eagle on the floor, all he can think about is Annabeth telling Grover that the Oracle won\u2019t give her a prophecy. The Oracle won\u2019t give anyone prophecies.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>That means\u2014</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Percy grins, laughs to himself in relief. He can\u2019t believe\u2014Of course, they\u2019d suspected this would happen, but they hadn\u2019t known for sure. Now he knows. Now he\u2019s sure.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The Oracle can\u2019t give prophecies anymore. No one knows what the future looks like. And no one can control it.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>That means they have a chance.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cPercy,\u201d Luke says, \u201clet\u2019s train.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhat?\u201d Percy\u2019s busy right now, thanks. \u201cNo, I just figured out where they were hiding all the real food.\u201d There\u2019s a box of thin mints lying half an inch away from his outstretched fingers, and he can hear it taunting him. How evil do you have to be to shove all the cookie boxes behind the jars of pickled vegetables anyway?</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Luke makes a strangled sound, grabs Percy\u2019s ankle, and then pulls him out from underneath the storeroom shelf. Percy takes this with his usual grace, which means he\u2019s wiggling like a fish on dry land and cursing Luke out with everything he\u2019s ever heard his mom yell while driving.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Ever since Percy got a somewhat confused Luke to teach him How to Sail a Cruise Ship For Sons of Not Poseidon 101, they\u2019ve been swapping shifts at the bridge, getting closer and closer to Polyphemus\u2019s island. It\u2019s slow though, slower than what Percy could do on his own, using his power over the ocean. But Percy still can\u2019t\u2014He just doesn\u2019t want to spend so much energy on controlling this steaming trash pile of a ship anymore, okay? Even though he\u2019s worried about Annabeth and Grover also trying to make their way down south and Clarisse gunning for his head and what if they catch up before Percy and Luke get the Golden Fleece? Why is Percy always leading his friends into danger? Why why why why\u2014</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Anyway. Percy\u2019s been trying to eat his feelings, which is hard when he used the last of his M&amp;Ms to get back at Luke. He needs these cookies.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Luke shakes Percy\u2019s ankle, drawing his attention back. He looks a little concerned. \u201cYou can get hopped up on sugar later,\u201d he says. \u201cYou need to train now. You\u2019re out of practice.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou\u2019re out of practice,\u201d Percy mutters.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>But he still lets Luke help him up and lead him to the aft deck. Luke has never asked Percy to spend time with him like this, and it makes the part of Percy that still feels like his dumb twelve-year-old self get all excited. The other part of him is wondering if this means he\u2019s finally made progress in smothering Luke\u2019s inner evil, and the other other part of him is still screaming, </span>\n<em>\n<span>It\u2019s a trap! You better kill him before he kills you!</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>So, Percy thinks he\u2019s earned the right to sound whiny when he asks Luke, \u201cDo we have to fight on the yacht? Can\u2019t we wait until we\u2019re on land?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Luke shakes his head, kicking some of the deck chairs out of the way. \u201cYou never know where you might bump into a monster. Do you really think a hellhound will stop and wait if you say \u2018Hey, do you mind moving this fight somewhere else?\u2019\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>No. \u201cI won\u2019t know until I try.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Luke sighs heavily, shooting Percy a disapproving look that rivals his mom\u2019s.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Percy scuffs the toe of his sneaker on the deck. \u201cI just don\u2019t like fighting on yachts,\u201d he mumbles.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Luke settles into a ready stance, nodding Percy forward. \u201cConsidering who your father is, I\u2019d expect you to prefer it to land.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI\u2019m not my father.\u201d Percy uncaps Riptide. \u201cJust like you\u2019re not yours.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Luke\u2019s eyes flash. Looks like he still can\u2019t quench his instinctive rage at every mention of Hermes. That\u2019s fine. It\u2019s better that he spends his anger on Percy instead of hiding it and letting it simmer. Maybe someday he\u2019ll learn to be an angry knitter instead of an angry sword fighter. He and Annabeth can start a club.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>And Percy should probably start paying attention now because Luke has just lunged forward and cut a stray thread off the hem of Percy\u2019s shirt sleeve.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cKeep your guard up,\u201d Luke says, smirking.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Percy\u2019s undoubtedly clever comeback is drowned out by the clang of Backbiter\u2019s blade on Riptide\u2019s.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>At first, it\u2019s just the easy back and forth of a Camp Half-Blood warm up. Slash. Jab. Thrust. Parry. If Percy doesn\u2019t look at Luke\u2019s face, he can pretend that he\u2019s just getting ready for another sword fighting lesson, another day trying to teach kids who\u2019re too young how not to die under a monster\u2019s claw.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Then Luke picks up the pace.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>He\u2019s faster than Ares, but his hits are lighter. Backbiter\u2019s still a foot longer than Riptide though, and Percy isn\u2019t willing to get closer to Luke, no matter how much he presses. That means Percy\u2019s mostly restricted to defense.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Luke doesn\u2019t seem very happy with that. He lunges forward, even quicker than before, and hacks downward.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Percy\u2019s head fuzzes out. It\u2019s like his soul is going through a tunnel and losing its connection to his body. On instinct, he rolls. A deck chair is halved under Luke\u2019s blade.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Luke grins.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<span>I\u2019ll kill you quickly.</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>No. Percy pulls himself back. They\u2019re training. Luke isn\u2019t even carrying a shield. It\u2019s different this time.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Stay focused, Percy. Stay present.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Percy\u2019s sweating, but he feels cold. Luke jabs, he leaps back, and then he realizes that Luke is herding him towards the pool.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Percy sprints towards Luke, feints, and then somersaults over Backbiter, putting Luke between him and the water.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Luke spins around, eyebrows raised. He looks reluctantly impressed.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Then his eyes narrow. \u201cWhy aren\u2019t you using the water, Percy?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cDon\u2019t need it to beat you,\u201d Percy says, before leaping forward and smashing his blade against Luke\u2019s.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Actually, Percy\u2019s kind of been thinking about this a lot, too. Water is his father\u2019s element. So, how much of Percy\u2019s power is a gift from his father, and how much of it is really his? How much can he rely on? How much can be taken away?</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>In the past future, Luke didn\u2019t seem to rely on anything of Hermes\u2019s. The flying shoes were cursed to Tartarus. His sword was not a weapon of the gods. Percy bets that if Luke had recognized any part of his power as Hermes\u2019s, he would have burned it out of his veins even before Kronos burned out all the rest of him. Hermes certainly wouldn\u2019t have pulled away. He loved Luke, even though he sucked at showing it. Percy never did quite figure out if Luke hated him because he didn\u2019t know this or because he did.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Percy doesn\u2019t hate his dad. He\u2019s resented him, yeah, but he\u2019s not angry. Or he\u2019s not angry in the same way Luke was angry. But, Percy doesn\u2019t know if he can love him like he loves his mom. They just...haven\u2019t had enough time together. And if Percy can\u2019t figure out how to love his father, then he definitely can\u2019t expect his father to love him. Especially now.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Maybe that\u2019s the best answer. Maybe it\u2019s better to push people away before they can reject him.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Percy\u2019s tired of being expelled.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Thrust, parry, jab, slash. Percy moves around Luke like a moth dancing around a flame, trying to touch a part of him without getting burned by Backbiter.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cCome on, Percy. You\u2019ll never hit me like that.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Luke\u2019s bigger, stronger, heavier, and Percy is out of practice, if you call losing years of conditioning and muscle memory to time travel getting out of practice. Either way, it feels like he\u2019s moving through syrup. Like time is slowing down.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Percy leaps out of the way of a downward strike, and the scythe cuts a gash in the deck right between his feet.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Wait, no, it\u2019s a sword, not a scythe. Sword, not scythe.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Luke takes advantage of Percy\u2019s momentary distraction and shoves him to the floor, leaning his weight on their crossed swords.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cUse the water,\u201d he says in Percy\u2019s face. \u201cOr are you too much of a coward to face your own power?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Cheap blow. Percy can feel the familiar anger boiling at his arteries, can taste the brackish sweat on his lips.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Percy kicks Luke\u2019s feet out from underneath him and rolls, scrambling to his feet a safe distance away. Then, as Luke\u2019s climbing to his feet, he leaps forward and slams Riptide down.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Luke parries, stuck in a crouch. \u201cNow that\u2019s more like it!\u201d he says.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Faster, even faster. Percy gets in close, striking Backbiter\u2019s hilt and aiming for Luke\u2019s joints, trying to disable, trying to disarm. Luke dodges and ducks, slashes and thrusts\u2014the best sword fighter in three hundred years\u2014and when Percy\u2019s arms wobble and lower, Luke whacks him in the ribs with the flat of his blade.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>A pause. Both of them back away, recover distance.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Percy blinks the sweat out of his eyes while Luke examines the tear in his shirt. Then his eyes shift back to Percy, who brings Riptide up again. He belatedly realizes that Luke has forced him back towards the pool.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThe water, Percy,\u201d Luke cajoles. \u201cWhat\u2019s the point of all that power if you aren\u2019t going to use it?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>There is no point. There was never\u2014\u201cI don\u2019t want to,\u201d Percy says.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Luke shrugs. \u201cIt\u2019s your funeral.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>And then he hits so hard that Percy believes him.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Slash, miss, recover. Percy barely has time to attack now. He tries the feint and leap again, but Luke is ready for him and uses an arm across his gut to keep him grounded.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>As Percy reorients himself, Luke crouches and jabs\u2014</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Percy\u2019s leg is burning. His vision is blacking out. He\u2019s crawling towards the pool, but he\u2019s never going to make it, and Luke\u2019s going to let his bear minions kill Annabeth and Grover don\u2019t do it why Luke please\u2014</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>No. That\u2019s not\u2014</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The blade grazes Percy\u2019s arm, and he stumbles backwards. Black spots crowd his vision. He lunges forward blindly, even though he knows the strike won\u2019t land.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<span>A poor performance, Percy Jackson. Luke tells me you were never his match at swordplay.</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>No, wait. This is wrong. Where are the giants? Where\u2019s Beckendorf? And\u2014</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The boat lurches to the side, and water shoots out of the swimming pool, dousing Percy and Kronos and everyone on deck. The water revitalizes Percy, and he thrusts his sword forward, and\u2014</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>An exhilarated laugh.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Luke\u2019s laugh.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>He\u2019s laughing?</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>And it\u2019s his voice. Not Kronos\u2019s. And his scar still looks faded.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Are his eyes\u2014</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>He parries with Backbiter, knocking Percy off balance, but he doesn\u2019t take the opportunity to stab Percy in the thigh. Instead, he drops his sword and pushes Percy into the pool.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>What\u2014</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Percy falls.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>This is wrong.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Underwater, the world is quiet and calm. And even through the ripples, Percy can see\u2014</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Luke\u2019s eyes are blue.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Percy resurfaces, panting like he\u2019s just escaped from Cerberus again.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Luke\u2019s breathing hard, too. His hair is plastered to his forehead, like he\u2019s dumped his water bottle over himself after another bout in the arena. And he\u2019s smiling in a way that reminds Percy of why he once mistook Apollo for him.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cSee?\u201d Luke says. His shoes squeak against the wet floor. He crouches down at the edge of the pool and reaches out a hand.\u00a0 \u201cYou\u2019re fine. There\u2019s nothing to be afraid of.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<span>You\u2019re an unreliable weapon. You need to be replaced.</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>No. Percy caps his sword. He lets Luke pull him out of the pool and hopes Luke doesn\u2019t notice how he\u2019s trembling.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cPercy?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Percy can\u2019t look at him. He dodges Luke\u2019s outstretched hand and runs down, down, down to the engine room, tucking himself into a corner so small that Luke won\u2019t be able to reach him when he comes looking.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The noise drains all the chaos from Percy\u2019s head. It\u2019s warm. He presses his forehead to his knees and tries to breathe.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Luke doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s talking about.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u2014\u2014</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Eventually, Luke lures Percy out with the box of thin mints and a box of samoas thrown in for good measure. He eyes Percy carefully while Percy shoves cookie after cookie in his mouth, not stopping until he feels sick.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>It\u2019s fine. At least it\u2019s a different kind of sick from before. At least Percy knows this sick will go away.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>He pulls himself together in time to check in with Silena, who seems both more frazzled and more animated each time they call. Luke is reluctant to let Percy hold the mirror, which is annoying, considering that Percy\u2019s hands are only kind of shaking. The sugar rush will wear off soon anyway. Still, Luke gives him uneasy looks as he dodges Silena\u2019s questions about how their cruise is going and when they think they\u2019re coming back, instead telling her stories about helpful hippocampi and magical resort islands.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cDid that really happen?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>In another life. \u201cSure.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Once the pleasantries are over with, they dive into business.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHas Mr. D said anything?\u201d Percy asks. The houses are important to him, but he really doesn\u2019t want any campers to be turned into dolphins for them. If anyone should be standing in the line of vaporization, it should be him.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Thankfully, Silena answers, \u201cNope! He\u2019s been holed up in the Big House. Castor told me that he\u2019s been having headaches.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Headaches. Percy wonders...</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>But that\u2019s something for another time. Percy has priorities, too. \u201cWhat about Chiron?\u201d he says. \u201cIs he back yet?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Silena hesitates. \u201cYeah. He\u2019s...I\u2019m not sure if he approves, but he hasn\u2019t made any official announcements about us. He seems a bit\u2014preoccupied.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Percy glances at Luke, who looks back, eyebrows furrowed. In Percy\u2019s dream, Annabeth had mentioned the Manhattan penthouse. Percy can\u2019t\u2014doesn\u2019t recall how they left that place, but he\u2019s sure it wasn\u2019t pretty. Luke managed to dig up the paperwork for the </span>\n<em>\n<span>Princess Andromeda</span>\n</em>\n<span> there. And Chiron knows about the Romans. Is it possible that if he searched the apartment, he would have found\u2014</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Not the time. Silena\u2019s looking worried now, so Percy tells her, \u201cJust keep going then. And if he really does start threatening the new arts and crafts projects\u2026\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Percy pauses. Will Chiron threaten them? If he knows about Camp Jupiter, then he should also know about New Rome and what it offers to demigods. Then again, community development is not what Chiron is at Camp Half-Blood for. Sure, he cares about the campers, but in the end, his job is to train heroes. Not raise kids.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Chiron\u2019s a good teacher. The best Percy\u2019s had. But, he\u2019s seen a lot of kids die young, and he\u2019s resigned to seeing a lot more. He\u2019s used to mourning over heroes who sacrifice themselves to preserve humanity\u2019s good.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>That\u2019s not what Percy\u2019s fighting for. And it never has been.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Something hits Percy\u2019s knee, and he flinches. It\u2019s Luke\u2019s thigh. He\u2019s sending Percy a concerned look, and Percy realizes that he\u2019s been quiet for too long.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>He shakes his head, trying to clear his thoughts away. \u201cIt\u2019ll be fine,\u201d he tells Silena. \u201cWe\u2019ll figure something out.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>She doesn\u2019t look reassured. Honestly, Percy isn\u2019t either.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Luke presses his lips together and looks down at his hands.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Silena lets out a shaky breath, then smiles. \u201cOn a brighter note, I brought another person who wants to help out!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>She turns to the side, waving someone over, and it\u2019s\u2014</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHey, guys,\u201d Beckendorf grins. \u201cI heard that you\u2019re building ca\u2014\u201c</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHouses. Small houses,\u201d Silena interrupts. She nudges Beckendorf with her shoulder, then just stays there, leaning against him. \u201cJust a couple of arts and crafts projects, really. Charlie, we\u2019ve been over this.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cRight,\u201d Beckendorf rubs the back of his neck sheepishly. \u201cSorry, Silena.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Percy smiles, hoping he looks welcoming and not absolutely horrified. Beckendorf is definitely the guy you want on your side in any situation, but Percy does remember what happened the last time he helped him out.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Maybe Percy should be asking the naiads to help him build underground apocalypse bunkers, too, so that he can lock all his friends away when\u2014</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWe\u2019re happy to have your support, Beckendorf,\u201d Luke says. He seems to waver for a second before continuing, \u201cBut I think Silena\u2019s given you the wrong idea\u2014\u201c</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Okay, no. \u201cYeah,\u201d Percy says loudly. \u201cBecause it\u2019s not just houses. We need furniture and decorations too.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cDecorations?\u201d Beckendorf asks, looking intrigued.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Percy nods. \u201cSome of the campers might want to customize their arts and crafts. With decorations. Related to their specific abilities or their heritage or the things they like,\u201d he adds. This way, it\u2019ll be easier to pass Beckendorf off as just an admirer of godly abilities or an innocent artist if anything happens. Not that anything will happen, since Percy refuses to fuck up again.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Beckendorf winks. \u201cGotcha, Percy. Leave it to me.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>While Percy flounders through Beckendorf\u2019s questions about the other stuff they might need, he also keeps an ear out for Silena, who\u2019s addressing Luke quietly at the side.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201c\u2014ted to say that I\u2019m sorry for doubting you. I didn\u2019t tell you this but\u2014\u201d Silena glances up at Luke, then away. \u201cThe way you were talking last winter kind of scared me. I\u2014I was afraid that you were just using us to get back at the gods. That we were just your pawns. But, this\u2014\u201d She smiles. \u201cThis could really be something. Did you know that Ethan actually laughed the other day? And Chris and the other undetermined campers\u2014they finally look like they have hope for the future. They\u2019re finally\u2014\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Silena looks down, then wipes her eyes. Beckendorf, distracted from his speech about wall fixtures, turns to her, whispering something Percy can\u2019t catch. She shakes her head, and he hugs her closer to his side.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>After a moment, Silena faces the mirror again. She says, \u201cThis is really helping, Luke. This could save lives.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYeah,\u201d Luke says blankly. \u201cSaving lives.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>When Silena and Beckendorf both grin at them through the mirror, they look like a better representation of love than any temple of Aphrodite.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Luke\u2019s expression is slack and strange. He looks like he\u2019s staring at something all the way across the sea.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Hey. Percy reaches out and tugs at Luke\u2019s index and middle fingers until he looks down and sees that he\u2019s pressing pink crescent moons into the back of his clasped hands. He untangles his fingers and places his palms on his thighs.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou know, Luke,\u201d Silena says. \u201cI think you really needed this cruise. You look a lot better than you did at camp.\u201d She flashes Percy a look full of mischief and adds, \u201cYou should thank Percy.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYeah,\u201d Percy repeats, \u201cyou should thank me.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Luke glances down at him, unamused. \u201cI\u2019ll thank you with some extra sword fighting practice later.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Percy fakes his look of horror, but his shudder is all real.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Better change the subject. \u201cSo,\u201d he says to Beckendorf. \u201cHow soon do you think you can finish a set of furniture?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Beckendorf frowns. \u201cNot quickly enough to meet demand. Especially if the campers also want something that\u2019s\u2014specific.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cMost of the campers who\u2019ve\u2014um, who\u2019re really dedicated to their projects are still in sleeping bags,\u201d Silena says.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Luke furrows his brow. \u201cYou should prioritize getting them off the floor. Can you mass produce a basic bed and then work on the custom builds later?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNot exactly,\u201d Beckendorf says slowly. \u201cI could probably get some of the dryads to help, but that would take manpower away from home construction.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cDryadpower, Charlie.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cRight, dryadpower.\u201d Beckendorf grins adoringly at Silena. \u201cMy bad.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThe Poseidon cabin has a ton of extra beds,\u201d Percy says. \u201cYou could take some.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Beckendorf makes a face. \u201cI don\u2019t really want to be turned into sea foam by your father, Percy.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cBut he doesn\u2019t live there,\u201d Percy points out. \u201cI do.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYeah, but I\u2019d be the one dragging your furniture out the door, not you.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>True. And Percy really doesn\u2019t want Beckendorf to be sea foam either. Maybe\u2014\u201cDo you think you could convince some other campers to donate furniture from their cabins? If they move their own stuff out, it shouldn\u2019t be a problem.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWe can try!\u201d Silena says. \u201cA lot of people have been interested in getting involved in the arts and crafts projects already. Don\u2019t worry,\u201d she tells Luke. \u201cWe haven\u2019t told them that they\u2019re for\u2014a specific purpose. But, I don\u2019t think many of them will be happy if we start asking for their things.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Yeah. Percy deflates. He can\u2019t see Clarisse or her siblings willingly giving up a chair or two to some reject wimp they\u2019ve already dunked in a toilet.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Then Luke says, \u201cWhat if you\u2019re not asking for their things?\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Huh?</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHuh?\u201d Silena asks.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhat if you\u2019re offering them something in exchange for some old furniture they don\u2019t even use?\u201d Luke says, looking thoughtful. \u201cYou said people were interested in getting involved? A lot of Athena kids, I\u2019m guessing, and maybe some from Hephaestus?\u201d he adds, glancing at Beckendorf, who nods. \u201cThey\u2019ll want input and creative control, a place to show off their skills\u2014Delegate the design and construction work to them, and they\u2019ll be willing to donate more than just their time.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Silena\u2019s eyes brighten, but Luke\u2019s just getting started.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThe Ares cabin already wants the Hermes cabin to be split up for strategic purposes\u2014The only good part about being overcrowded is that we sway Capture the Flag victories towards whichever cabin we\u2019re allied to,\u201d he says sourly. \u201cTake that angle to convince them.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Beckendorf nods in agreement. Silena\u2019s scribbling down notes in his pocket sketchbook.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOffer the Demeter kids free reign over the yards\u2014You have been allocating yard space, right? The Apollo kids might be willing to help as soon as they figure out we\u2019re resolving the Hermes cabin\u2019s fire safety problem. The Aphrodite cabin\u2026\u201d Luke trails off.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI\u2019ve already talked to some of my siblings,\u201d Silena explains, \u201cbut they aren\u2019t very eager to get their hands dirty.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Luke thinks for a moment, then says, \u201cWhat if we promised to build them a space where they can\u2014\u201d He glances down at Percy, before continuing \u201c\u2014enjoy some private time?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Silena goes red, her gaze flickering to Beckendorf for a second. \u201cThat...That might work.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cGood.\u201d Luke ignores Percy\u2019s scowl\u2014He\u2019s not a little kid!\u2014finishing with, \u201cAnd you should be able to convince Castor and Pollux to give furniture and run interference against Mr. D by telling them you know about their secret wine stash in the strawberry fields.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI knew it!\u201d Beckendorf exclaims. \u201cNo one can be that happy about sitting around and making plants grow all day.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI\u2019m sure growing strawberry plants is very relaxing,\u201d Silena says.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNot as relaxing as getting hammered,\u201d Beckendorf mutters.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Silena elbows him in the side, and he doubles over, groaning exaggeratedly.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Luke gives them a moment, his lips curling upwards with reluctant amusement. The set of his shoulders and the tone of his voice remind Percy of the young general who headed Kronos\u2019s army and almost killed him on this boat. But, his face is quite different.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Percy stares up at Luke, not bitter or cold or spilling over with hate, and thinks, </span>\n<em>\n<span>How long did he spend coming up with this stuff?</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Does this mean that if things had just been a bit different last time, if Luke\u2019s life hadn\u2019t been so warped by the wills of gods and titans, if he had realized what power he already held in his own two hands, then maybe\u2014</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cDid you get all of that?\u201d Luke says.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYup!\u201d Silena flips Beckendorf\u2019s sketchbook shut and shoves it back into his pocket. \u201cJust leave it to us, Luke. You\u2019ll be looking at a totally new camp by the time you get back.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cGood,\u201d Luke nods. \u201cThere\u2019s no reason for kids to be on the floor when we have empty beds.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Maybe he does have a place in the future Percy came back to create.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>After a couple more assurances from Silena and Beckendorf, Luke shuts down the mirror call. It takes Percy a second to remember to put his hand down.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Luke lets out a breath, sitting back and stretching his arms across the length of the sofa. Then he glances down at Percy, one eyebrow raised.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhy are you looking at me like that?\u201d he asks.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNo reason,\u201d Percy says.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Just thinking about hope.</span>\n</p>\n<p>The stars are bright tonight. Bob would\u2019ve loved this.</p>\n<p>Percy wishes he could show him, sit him down on the neighboring beach chair and let him gaze up at the sky. But Bob isn\u2019t Bob, and Percy won\u2019t be able to be his friend again.</p>\n<p>Shut up, Percy. This isn\u2019t the time for thoughts like that.</p>\n<p>Percy came to the upper deck to watch for\u2014Well, he actually doesn\u2019t know. A cannonball from Clarisse\u2019s steamship? Annabeth and Grover paddling towards him on a lifeboat? Even though he\u2019s the one who should always know what\u2019s going on, he feels lost. He never imagined he could be lost at sea.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s keeping him awake, the plans and back up plans and back up back up plans spinning around in his head. There\u2019s so much he can\u2019t control, an entire ocean of variables pushing up against his ribs and abdomen, and he\u2019s already so tired. But, it\u2019ll be worth it. He has to believe\u2014The future he\u2019s making will be worth this. Worth everything.</p>\n<p>It\u2019ll be fine. Luke is different, he thinks. And Annabeth and Grover and Clarisse\u2014They won\u2019t be in danger if Percy destroys every danger before it can reach them.</p>\n<p>Annabeth will have to protect Grover from being guinea pig-ed though. Percy\u2019s not powerful enough to do anything about that.</p>\n<p>Percy looks up at the stars, the ocean breeze brushing against his cheek. As he waits, all the monsters inside him slowly go quiet.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Footsteps.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo that\u2019s where my jacket went,\u201d Luke says, amused.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m cold,\u201d Percy tells him.</p>\n<p>\u201cThen you should\u2019ve bought a jacket before we left.\u201d Luke plops down on the chair beside Percy. He leans over, tugs the jacket\u2019s lapels closer together, then starts doing up the buttons.</p>\n<p>\u201cI was saving up for a skateboard.\u201d Percy bats Luke\u2019s hands away before they can reach his neck, and Luke flicks him in the chin in retaliation.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not even that cold out,\u201d Luke says, sitting back and folding his hands behind his head.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m a fish,\u201d Percy insists. \u201cWe\u2019re cold blooded.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYour dad is a fish,\u201d Luke points out. \u201cYou\u2019re a half-fish.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you have to argue with me about everything?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll stop arguing with you when you start making sense.\u201d</p>\n<p>Percy snorts. Luke\u2019s definition of sense has never agreed with his own. Then again, maybe that can change, too.</p>\n<p>The <em> Princess Andromeda </em> is big enough that the waves can\u2019t rock it. Here, underneath the stars with Luke lying quietly beside him, Percy can almost understand why people actually pay money to go on cruises.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Almost.</p>\n<p>Still, Percy muses, \u201cMaybe if Mr. D blasts the arts and crafts projects, we can just move everyone here.\u201d</p>\n<p>Luke shifts. \u201cWe should be moving everyone here anyway. Building an army on enemy grounds isn\u2019t a good idea.\u201d</p>\n<p>Enemy grounds? No, wait\u2014\u201cAn army?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIsn\u2019t that what Kronos wants the projects for?\u201d Luke turns to Percy, bracing himself up on his elbows. The starlight isn\u2019t bright enough for Percy to read his expression.</p>\n<p>Percy takes a breath, lets it out, and tries not to sound too annoyed when he says, \u201cWe\u2019re not recruiting campers for Kronos\u2019s army. They\u2019ll die.\u201d</p>\n<p>Luke tilts his head to the side, not arguing.</p>\n<p>The anger shoots through Percy\u2019s veins like poison from the Chimera\u2019s snake head, acrid and sudden.</p>\n<p>He sits up and asks Luke. \u201cWhy do you want to kill demigods so badly?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to kill demigods,\u201d Luke says coolly. \u201cI want the gods to fall.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd letting demigods die is the only way to do that?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSoldiers die in war. That\u2019s natural.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re not soldiers. We\u2019re kids.\u201d</p>\n<p>Luke shrugs. \u201cKids die in war, too.\u201d</p>\n<p>Asshole. What a fucking\u2014\u201cThey shouldn\u2019t have to,\u201d Percy argues.</p>\n<p>Luke laughs, pushing himself all the way up, and Percy almost punches him in the jaw. \u201cDon\u2019t be naive, Percy,\u201d he says, leaning forward until they\u2019re nose to nose. \u201cDemigods are born to fight their parents\u2019 battles for them. Our lives are messy and violent and cursed and short.\u201d His voice is tight and bitter.</p>\n<p>\u201cThen why join Kronos?\u201d Percy says. \u201cWhat makes fighting his battles for him any better?\u201d</p>\n<p>Luke smiles, but his eyes are dark and cold. \u201cAt least with Kronos I\u2019ll get to take Olympus down with me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Silence. Percy searches Luke\u2019s face.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Nothing but shadows.</p>\n<p>\u201cIs revenge really worth your entire life?\u201d Percy says, not quite sure if he\u2019s asking for a real answer or begging for the one he needs.</p>\n<p>Luke doesn\u2019t say anything for a long time.</p>\n<p>Then he throws his head back, stares up at the sky, and sighs. \u201cMy life\u2019s already over,\u201d he mutters. \u201cThis is what I have left.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Before Percy can figure out a good response to that\u2014something besides \u201cFuck that noise\u201d\u2014Luke asks, \u201cWhat about you, Percy? Why are you with Kronos?\u201d</p>\n<p>Uh. Well. About that.</p>\n<p>Percy shrugs and hopes that his expression is as unreadable as Luke\u2019s is in the starlight. \u201cI just want to keep some people alive.\u201d</p>\n<p>A pause.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Then Luke snorts, shaking his head.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re such a child,\u201d he says.</p>\n<p>Okay, first of all, fuck you. Second of all, <em> fuck </em> you. \u201cI\u2019m not a child for wanting to protect my friends,\u201d Percy snaps.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re a child for believing that you can,\u201d Luke says. And the worst part is that he doesn\u2019t say it like he\u2019s taunting Percy or making fun of him. He says it like he\u2019s stating something as simple as <em> A cyclops has one eye </em> or <em> Zeus is a dick. </em></p>\n<p>Percy stares at Luke\u2019s face, shrouded in darkness. He doesn\u2019t know whether he wants to shout or swear or just grab him by the shoulders and shake and shake and <em> shake </em> until he finally stops saying things that make it seem like this world can\u2019t be saved.</p>\n<p>They\u2019ve been in the same boat for days, and yet there\u2019s still an ocean between them.</p>\n<p>Why is Luke like this? What can Percy say?</p>\n<p>\n<em> You can\u2019t give up on your family, no matter how tempting they make it. </em>\n</p>\n<p>But how can Percy change someone who doesn\u2019t want to be changed?</p>\n<p>Luke sighs again. He stands. \u201cGo below deck if you\u2019re cold. It\u2019s past your bedtime anyway.\u201d</p>\n<p>Percy watches Luke walk away, a black silhouette against the dark sky. He wonders if he\u2019ll soon have to accept the fact that the only thing Luke wants from the bottom of his heart is the destruction of everything he hates, even at the cost of everything he loves.</p>\n<p>Of course, because Percy\u2019s life is a joke, that\u2019s exactly when the Sirens start singing.</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>\u2014\u2014</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>Actually, Percy doesn\u2019t realize what\u2019s happening at first.</p>\n<p>He just sees Luke stop halfway to the door. For a moment, he\u2019s standing perfectly still. Then he slowly turns in the direction of the railing.</p>\n<p>\u201cLuke?\u201d Percy says.</p>\n<p>Luke sways.\u00a0</p>\n<p>And then he starts sprinting. At full speed. Straight towards the side of the yacht.</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t\u2014!\u201d Percy leaps off the beach chair and tackles Luke in the legs, downing him right before he can crash into the railing.</p>\n<p>Note to self: Luke isn\u2019t just a great sword fighter. He\u2019s also a half-decent wrestler, even when he\u2019s trying to jump into the ocean and drown himself.</p>\n<p>While Percy tries to get his hands around Luke\u2019s ears, he takes an elbow to the face and a knee to the gut. As Luke tries to kick his legs free, Percy scrabbles forward and throws his entire weight onto Luke\u2019s stomach, knocking the breath out of him. This gives Percy enough time to put him in a guillotine choke hold.</p>\n<p>Not for the first time, Percy is very grateful that Annabeth agreed to spend so much time sparring with him.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, Annabeth learned how to fight from Luke, so Percy actually holds him for about one second before Luke\u2019s rolling and smashing Percy into the deck floor. Luke presses his shoulder into Percy\u2019s neck. It doesn\u2019t take long before Percy\u2019s wheezing and seeing spots.</p>\n<p>On the bright side, at least he can\u2019t hear any Siren song over the buzz of blood rushing to his head.</p>\n<p>Percy is breathing like a fish out of water, but he can\u2019t let Luke go. He keeps his legs locked around Luke\u2019s waist even as his clamp on his neck weakens enough that Luke pries his arms off. Luke climbs to his feet, Percy still clinging to him like a koala with mild smoke inhalation, and continues stumbling forward.</p>\n<p>And before Percy can even think about going for Luke\u2019s ears again, Luke tips them over the railing.</p>\n<p>The cool air rushes past them, and Percy can see the stars falling away. The water below is dark and unforgiving, so black that it\u2019s almost indistinguishable from the void that his dreams tend to feature.</p>\n<p>Later, Percy will think about this moment and wonder why he doesn\u2019t call up a geyser from the sea to break their fall. He\u2019s done it before, so he won\u2019t understand why he doesn\u2019t remember to do it now. Maybe it\u2019s because Annabeth isn\u2019t with him. Then again, that\u2019s the whole point of this trip.</p>\n<p>Percy doesn\u2019t remember to soften their landing. Instead, he remembers to fold and tangle Luke\u2019s legs with his own, so Luke probably won\u2019t shatter his shins on the ocean\u2019s surface. He remembers to tuck Luke\u2019s head under his chin. He remembers to close his eyes.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Protect him. <em> Brace yourself. </em></p>\n<p>The water is cold.</p>\n<p>At first, Percy thinks the darkness is from the ocean. But he doesn\u2019t feel the weight of the waves pressing down on him. And his arms are empty.</p>\n<p>The panic chokes him worse than Luke did.</p>\n<p>Where is he?</p>\n<p>\u201cL\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLuke?\u201d</p>\n<p>Percy\u2019s words break off.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He knows that voice.</p>\n<p>\u201cLuke, I\u2019m sorry it took so long, but it\u2019s alright now. I\u2019m here. Where are you?\u201d</p>\n<p>That\u2019s...</p>\n<p>\u201cLuke?\u201d And the creak of a door opening.</p>\n<p>Light floods Percy\u2019s vision.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s Hermes. He\u2019s standing in the doorway, framed by the warm light. And he\u2019s smiling down at\u2014</p>\n<p>Percy looks to his right. Then down.\u00a0</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a mini Luke curled up on the ground next to him. Percy\u2019s never seen an elementary school edition of Luke in real life before. He\u2019s really small.</p>\n<p>\u201cThere you are,\u201d Hermes says. He kneels down in front of Luke and holds out his hand. \u201cIt\u2019s alright. You can come out now. Everything is alright.\u201d</p>\n<p>A pause.</p>\n<p>Hermes doesn\u2019t waver.</p>\n<p>Slowly, cautiously, Luke reaches out with one skinny arm. He takes Hermes\u2019s hand.</p>\n<p>The dark walls around them vanish.</p>\n<p>Percy barely recognizes Ms. Castellan\u2019s kitchen. It looks a lot different without all the moldy peanut butter sandwiches stacked on the counter or the trays of burnt cookies on top of the stove or the Hermes collage taped above the sink.</p>\n<p>It also looks a lot different with Ms. Castellan from before she tried to host the Oracle standing there in the middle of the room.</p>\n<p>Hermes guides Luke towards her, waiting patiently as he hesitates.</p>\n<p>When Ms. Castellan spots Luke, her eyes well up, and she drops to her knees. She opens her arms.</p>\n<p>For a brief moment, Luke shrinks into himself, eyeing her cautiously. After she does nothing but blink tears out of her unclouded eyes, he glances up at Hermes, who nods.</p>\n<p>Then he rushes forward.</p>\n<p>Luke\u2019s hugging Ms. Castellan so tightly that Percy\u2019s surprised she even has the breath to speak, but she does. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I scared you, baby. But I\u2019m okay now.\u201d She rubs Luke\u2019s back, presses his head into her shoulder. \u201cI\u2019m okay,\u201d she says softly. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I hurt you. It\u2019ll never happen again.\u201d</p>\n<p>Percy doesn\u2019t really remember what Ms. Castellan\u2019s voice sounds like. The glowing eyes made a much deeper impression. But, right now, she kind of sounds like Percy\u2019s mom.</p>\n<p>Down to the way she says, \u201cI love you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Hermes joins the two figures kneeling in the kitchen and wraps his arms around both of them. Whole, balanced, and bathed in golden light, they look like a perfect family.</p>\n<p>Then mini Luke shudders, rippling, and he grows into the Luke who Percy knows. Except he doesn\u2019t have a scar. It makes him look\u2014honestly, sort of weird. Like there\u2019s something essentially Luke missing from his face.</p>\n<p>Luke\u2019s parents don\u2019t stop hugging him, but after a moment, he gently untangles himself from their embrace and helps them to their feet. Ms. Castellan beams and pats his hand. Hermes leans close to Luke\u2019s ear and says something that Percy can\u2019t catch.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Then there are footsteps pounding towards them from the living room.</p>\n<p>Annabeth and Thalia tumble into the kitchen, smiling, laughing. Luke\u2019s eyes widen. And then he grins, as warm as the sun.</p>\n<p>Percy watches Luke hug Thalia before lifting her into the air, spinning her in a circle while she yelps in protest, pounding his back, and Annabeth giggles.\u00a0</p>\n<p>They look so happy.</p>\n<p><em> This is how it should have been, </em> Percy thinks.</p>\n<p>Suddenly, Luke meets Percy\u2019s eyes over Thalia\u2019s shoulder. There\u2019s a flash of\u2014something.</p>\n<p>And then it all disappears.</p>\n<p>Somehow, Percy feels like he\u2019s falling again.</p>\n<p>The water is cold. And dark. The waves press down on him with suffocating weight.</p>\n<p>But, Luke is still here.</p>\n<p>That\u2019s enough.</p>\n<p>Percy feels Luke thrashing in his arms, trying to kick them towards the surface, and for a second, he thinks that he\u2019s still fighting to get to the Sirens. Then he remembers that Luke can\u2019t breathe underwater.</p>\n<p>Right.</p>\n<p>Percy concentrates on summoning bubbles until there\u2019s an orb of air around Luke\u2019s head, like an astronaut\u2019s helmet. Once that\u2019s done, Luke finally goes still.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He\u2019s not limp, which is the only reason why Percy doesn\u2019t freak out about accidentally drowning him. But he doesn\u2019t react when Percy ducks down to check if his feet are broken. And he doesn\u2019t react when Percy hooks an arm around his waist and jets him back to the yacht. And he doesn\u2019t react during the whole time they spend trailing the yacht through the dark water.</p>\n<p>At first, Percy\u2019s glad. He doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019d do if Luke began crying in front of him. He\u2019d rather fight Charybdis again, actually. But, after about ten minutes of zero reaction from a guy who just got shown his deepest desire before it was ripped away, even the most heartless monster would start getting worried.</p>\n<p>Percy tightens his grip around Luke\u2019s waist, focusing, and he manages to shoot them out of the ocean and onto the gangway. Honestly, it\u2019s not one of his more graceful landings, but Luke doesn\u2019t seem to mind. He just rolls onto his back, taking deep breaths of the night air. After a moment, Percy crawls forward, patting the ground blindly until he touches Luke\u2019s wrist. He dries Luke off.</p>\n<p>Luke flinches like Percy\u2019s burning him and quickly shakes him off. He gets to his feet, looming over Percy.</p>\n<p>\u201cLuke\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou saw nothing,\u201d Luke says. His voice is low and hoarse and brittle. \u201cNothing. Got it?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Percy says, raising his hands even though Luke probably can\u2019t see them. \u201cOkay. But, hypothetically,\u201d he adds carefully, \u201cif I had seen something, then I\u2019d tell you that you don\u2019t have anything to be embarrassed about.\u201d</p>\n<p>Luke scoffs. \u201cOf course I don\u2019t. Why would I feel embarrassed? That wasn\u2019t my deepest desire. That was\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>He cuts himself off.\u00a0</p>\n<p>A heavy silence, broken only by the crashing of waves into the sea.</p>\n<p>Percy wonders if they\u2019d both been expecting the same thing. Luke enthroned in the rubble of Olympus. The gods\u2019s heads on pikes outside of whatever nightmare palace Kronos wants to build in its stead. Hermes, beaten and bleeding, kneeling at his feet.</p>\n<p>The reality of what Luke really wants is shocking to Percy. He can\u2019t imagine how Luke feels.</p>\n<p>Percy watches Luke carefully. Maybe his shoulders are shaking. Maybe it\u2019s just the boat.</p>\n<p>Either way, no matter how much Luke is hurting right now, Percy can\u2019t allow him to deny this truth.</p>\n<p>It may not save Olympus. But, it\u2019ll definitely save him.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnnabeth told me,\u201d Percy says slowly, \u201cthat the Sirens show you things that you didn\u2019t know about yourself.\u201d He gets to his feet, facing Luke in the shadows. \u201cI didn\u2019t see anything, but maybe you should think twice about whether you want to stay blind.\u201d</p>\n<p>Luke makes a sound that\u2019s caught between a snarl and a sob. Other than Kronos\u2019s voice, it\u2019s the scariest thing Percy\u2019s heard come out of Luke\u2019s mouth.</p>\n<p>Percy stays still and silent as Luke struggles to regain control over himself. His harsh breathing grows slower, quieter, until he can say, with his normal amount of dry bitterness\u2014</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd you, Percy? What pretty lie did the Sirens show you?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Percy blinks.</p>\n<p>Right. He didn\u2019t plug his ears this time. So why did he see\u2014</p>\n<p>\u201cNothing,\u201d Percy says.</p>\n<p>\u201cCome on, Jackson. Get off your high horse.\u201d Percy can\u2019t make out Luke\u2019s face in the darkness, but he can imagine the sneer twisting up his scar. \u201cOr are you afraid to admit you\u2019re just the blind leading the blind?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m telling you the truth,\u201d Percy insists. \u201cI really didn\u2019t see anything.\u201d</p>\n<p>Luke pauses. Percy wonders if he can hear that Percy is as incredulous as he is.</p>\n<p>Then Luke shakes his head, evidently giving up on making sense of any of the impossible things that\u2019ve happened tonight. \u201cWere your ears plugged with the fuzz from your brain?\u201d he mutters, stalking back inside.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Percy calls, \u201cbut listening to your stupid justifications did make me go deaf!\u201d</p>\n<p>Luke doesn\u2019t respond. His angry footsteps quickly disappear into the bowels of the ship.</p>\n<p>After a moment spent considering if Luke might respond well to being pushed a bit more right now, Percy decides to just let sleeping demigods lie. Luke deserves time to think. Besides, Percy needs to think a little bit, too.</p>\n<p>He lowers himself back onto the deck, staring out at the dark sea until light starts creeping up over the water.</p>\n<p>Looks like Percy can\u2019t be shown his deepest desire.</p>\n<p>Maybe it\u2019s because he\u2019s already living it.</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u2014\u2014</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>After a night spent gazing at stars, dodging Sirens, and watching the sunrise, Percy\u2019s looking forward to getting some shut-eye. Not in a bed, because Percy has a hard time falling asleep in a room where he once saw Kronos\u2019s body recomposing. Fortunately, the captain\u2019s chair is big enough (Or is it that Percy\u2019s still small enough?) to be comfortable.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, as soon as Percy enters the bridge, Luke slams him into the wall. Again.</p>\n<p>Between Annabeth and Luke, Percy\u2019s been getting closely acquainted with a lot of walls this year. He doesn\u2019t remember Thalia being so much of a wall slammer. She\u2019s his new favorite now.</p>\n<p>Luke pulls Percy out his thoughts by pressing his forearm to his throat. \u201cKronos didn\u2019t tell you to build cabins,\u201d he says.</p>\n<p>\u201cSmall houses,\u201d Percy corrects automatically. Then\u2014\u201dWait, what?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re not loyal to Kronos,\u201d Luke enunciates carefully. \u201cAnd everyone knows they\u2019re cabins, Percy. We\u2019re not stupid.\u201d</p>\n<p>Well.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Fuck.</p>\n<p>Turns out that being busted for not worshiping an evil titan lord is better than coffee. Percy is very awake now.</p>\n<p>The sting of alcohol on Luke\u2019s breath helps, too. Percy hates having beer breath in his face. It always makes his heart start racing. Where did Luke even find a bottle? Or maybe it was vodka. Whiskey? Percy doesn\u2019t know. He hasn\u2019t tried a lot of the stuff. In his experience, a drunk demigod is more likely to become a dead demigod. Besides, it\u2019s never fun when Percy loses control over himself.</p>\n<p>Hey, wait, focus, Percy! Remember the angry demigod pinning you to the wall!</p>\n<p>Should Percy try denying it? Would Luke even believe him? He accused him with the confidence of someone who\u2019s been gathering evidence for a very long time. Then again, drunk Luke.</p>\n<p>Bang! Luke slaps the wall next to Percy\u2019s face. Then he leans forward, eyes narrowed. Apparently drunk Luke isn\u2019t patient when he wants answers.</p>\n<p>Okay, uh\u2014\u201cI don\u2019t have to be loyal to Kronos to fight for him,\u201d Percy reasons. He\u2019s pretty sure most of the demigods who defected last time didn\u2019t do it because they wanted Kronos to rule. If anything, they were more loyal to Luke.</p>\n<p>\u201cBut you don\u2019t even want to fight,\u201d Luke smiles meanly. \u201cYou\u2019re having us build houses. I bet you\u2019re gonna tell us to hold hands with our parents and sing \u2018Kumbaya\u2019 around the campfire next.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHey, how\u2019d you guess?\u201d</p>\n<p>For that, Percy gets two seconds of Luke leaning what feels like his entire weight on his throat. Then Luke draws back, watching as Percy coughs.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou have a lot of secrets, Percy. And I\u2019ll admit it: I still don\u2019t know how you interfered with my connection to Kronos. But, it doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d</p>\n<p>Luke reaches behind the captain\u2019s chair and pulls out Backbiter, twirling it in his hand.</p>\n<p>Shit. Percy tenses.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll just beat it out of you,\u201d Luke says.\u00a0</p>\n<p>And then he charges.</p>\n<p>Percy doesn\u2019t even have time to grab Riptide from his pocket. He ducks under Luke\u2019s first slash, which gouges into the wall, and rolls closer to the controls, so Luke won\u2019t be able to hit him without sacrificing his ability to sail the cruise ship.</p>\n<p>Luke doesn\u2019t seem to care about that, though. He swipes at Percy and takes out the captain\u2019s chair when he dives.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Not good. Luke\u2019s tearing up the floor as Percy throws himself out of the way of his blade again and again, trying not to make it obvious that he\u2019s moving towards the door. It\u2019s harder than it should be, because Percy\u2019s still wearing Luke\u2019s stupid designer jacket and it\u2019s restricting his movements.</p>\n<p>Luke is doing just fine, despite stinking like he\u2019s played ten games of poker with Smelly Gabe. He moves with the care of someone who knows they\u2019re drunk and is doing their best to not show it. But, he\u2019s also swinging Backbiter like he doesn\u2019t care about which part of Percy he hits as long as he does actually hit him. That\u2019s different. Even when Luke lashed out before, he always grabbed Percy with purpose: to threaten, to silence, to disarm. Not now. Now he just wants to hit him.</p>\n<p>So, this is when Percy really starts feeling scared.</p>\n<p>\u201cUndo what you did,\u201d Luke says between blows. \u201cGive me my dreams back.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo Kronos can hurt you again?\u201d Percy manages. The door is finally within an arm\u2019s length. If he can distract Luke for a little longer\u2014</p>\n<p>Luke hacks downwards, and Percy curls up, using the momentum to roll to his feet so that he doesn\u2019t lose them.</p>\n<p>Both of them are breathing hard, the sound harsh and unsteady over the hum of the bridge. Luke\u2019s eyes are red and unfocused. Despite being the one who\u2019s been swinging his sword around here, he looks wrecked. And small. Like mini Luke curled up in the closet, waiting for someone to finally come get him and tell him everything\u2019s okay.</p>\n<p>Percy knows he should be grabbing Riptide right now, but he can\u2019t bring himself to fight Luke when he\u2019s like this. If Percy just\u2014runs and lets Luke tire himself out, is there a chance that he\u2019ll forget this ever happened when he wakes up?</p>\n<p>Can\u2019t it just be another nightmare?</p>\n<p>Percy glances at the door. When he looks back, Luke is already smashing Backbiter\u2019s hilt into his side.</p>\n<p>Hard.</p>\n<p>Percy staggers, falls, slams his head into the wall. He\u2019s seeing stars again, though they\u2019re not the nice kind this time.</p>\n<p>Then there\u2019s a hellhound on his chest and a line of ice on his neck. When Percy\u2019s vision clears up, he finds Luke holding Backbiter against his throat, frustration pulling at his scar.</p>\n<p>\u201cUndo it,\u201d Luke says.</p>\n<p>Percy hopes he doesn\u2019t look as scared as he feels. He swallows and feels Backbiter slice into his skin. \u201cNo. You don\u2019t belong with Kronos, Luke. You\u2019re just gonna have to find another way to get your revenge.\u201d</p>\n<p>Luke presses closer. His eyes are moving rapidly across Percy\u2019s face. And\u2014his hand must be shaking, because Backbiter is twitching along Percy\u2019s neck, like Luke is the worst barber in the history of demigod barbers.</p>\n<p>\u201cUndo it,\u201d Luke whispers. Then Percy actually feels Backbiter sink into his throat, cold and burning and only deep enough to hurt.</p>\n<p>Percy breathes, quick, shallow. The air feels thin.</p>\n<p>How did he get here? Is this really how this is going to\u2014</p>\n<p>No. Percy refuses. He can\u2019t die here. He can\u2019t.</p>\n<p>Fuck, Luke\u2019s hand is still trembling. Percy can feel the itch of blood crawling down his neck and pooling behind his collarbone.</p>\n<p>Wait.</p>\n<p>Blood.\u00a0</p>\n<p>His blood. Percy can. Percy can use that.</p>\n<p>Luke has his arms pinned, but Percy only needs a finger. He is his own weapon.</p>\n<p>If this is really Luke\u2019s choice, then\u2014then\u2014</p>\n<p>Percy will do it. He will. He knew when he led Luke out of Camp Half-Blood that this was one of the ways this trip could end.</p>\n<p>A smarter demigod would have done it sooner.</p>\n<p>Just\u2014Why can\u2019t Percy stop thinking about Luke in Ms. Castellan\u2019s kitchen, the second before the vision fell apart, when Luke looked at him, smiling so warmly, and almost called him over?</p>\n<p>Why can\u2019t he just\u2014</p>\n<p>Why\u2014?</p>\n<p>Percy stares up into Luke\u2019s eyes. \u201cI thought you didn\u2019t want to kill demigods,\u201d he says.</p>\n<p>The words pierce through the air like an accusation.</p>\n<p>Luke blinks the grey morning light out of his eyes. His gaze trails down Percy\u2019s face and reaches his neck, following the little stream of red into the collar of his jacket. For a second, he looks surprised.</p>\n<p>And then he just looks haggard.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lost.</p>\n<p>Luke takes a deep breath. And another.</p>\n<p>Percy waits. He slowly curls his fingers.</p>\n<p>Then\u2014</p>\n<p>Luke moves Backbiter away from Percy\u2019s neck. The edge of the blade is stained pink.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He tosses the sword aside, letting it slide into one of the gouges he left in the floor, and then he rolls off of Percy, slumping against the wall next to him.</p>\n<p>\u201cKilling you,\u201d Luke says heavily, \u201cwon\u2019t fix anything anyway.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s the spirit,\u201d Percy says. His voice is shaking.</p>\n<p>Sitting up is too much work. Percy presses his palm to his neck, and it comes away wet. Now that the adrenaline is starting to wear off, even his own blood feels cold and gross on his skin.</p>\n<p>Luke reaches over, like he wants to finish the job with a good throttling or maybe like he actually wants to help. Percy can\u2019t deal with that right now, and it probably shows on his face, since Luke jolts to a stop, then puts his hand down. He looks too shattered for being the one person in the room not currently bleeding out.</p>\n<p>Percy needs Luke to stop looking like that. He pinches the cut closed, squeezes his eyes shut, and concentrates on keeping his blood inside his body. And he doesn\u2019t really know if he can make his blood clot faster, but hoping that he can do something crazy has let him do a lot of crazy things in the past.</p>\n<p>Ugh. It feels like there are tiny snakes moving through his arteries, which isn\u2019t great, but it seems to be\u2014</p>\n<p>Whoa.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Percy\u2019s really dizzy. And weak, like, stomach flu for eight hours and battle with an ancient sea monster weak. This must be why people don\u2019t eat their own legs when they\u2019re starving.</p>\n<p>But, hey, the bleeding\u2019s stopped. Cool.</p>\n<p>Percy opens his eyes and finds Luke staring at him like he just nailed Kronos in the eye with a blue hairbrush. So, that probably looked pretty weird from the outside.</p>\n<p>But, there are more important things they need to talk about right now.</p>\n<p>Percy drags himself upright, until he and Luke are sitting shoulder to shoulder. Luke still sort of smells like an open bar, but he seems more alert now. Maybe the sight of Percy\u2019s blood sobered him up.</p>\n<p>It better have. Percy hates bleeding for no reason.</p>\n<p>Percy spends a couple seconds gathering his words. Then he carefully turns towards Luke. He tells him, \u201cYou don\u2019t want Kronos in your head, Luke. You can live a long, peaceful life with the people you love if you just learn to<em> let go.\u201d </em></p>\n<p>Luke keeps staring straight ahead at the bisected captain\u2019s chair, but he doesn\u2019t go for Backbiter again, which is an improvement. \u201cYou\u2019re delusional,\u201d he says.</p>\n<p>Percy doesn\u2019t even have the energy for frustration anymore. \u201cThe houses are being built. Did you know that Annabeth designed all of them? You won\u2019t have to spend the rest of your life in a crowded cabin full of abandoned kids. She\u2019ll jump at the chance to design another place just for you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Luke still doesn\u2019t move.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need to obsess over your revenge,\u201d Percy continues. \u201cYou can just\u2014live your life. And you\u2019re a leader, Luke. Once the other campers see that they can thrive even if they don\u2019t fixate on their parents\u2014especially if they don\u2019t fixate on their parents\u2014more and more of them will turn their backs on the gods. No more sacrifices. No more pawns. Isn\u2019t that what you want?\u201d</p>\n<p>Ow. Even Percy can hear the edge in his voice when he finishes. He hopes Luke didn\u2019t nick anything really important in his throat.</p>\n<p>He glances up at Luke\u2019s face. Nothing.</p>\n<p>Fine. Percy has time. The day\u2019s just getting started.</p>\n<p>Percy\u2019s neck itches. Is it the drying blood or a consequence of whatever he did to himself? He reaches up to touch, but before he can brush skin, Luke catches his wrist and returns it to his side.</p>\n<p>Luke won\u2019t look at Percy, but he keeps his hand on his.</p>\n<p>They sit quietly for some time.</p>\n<p>Finally\u2014\u201cHalf-bloods don\u2019t live long lives,\u201d Luke says. His voice is hoarse. \u201cThere\u2019s always another fight. Another monster.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, what if all the monsters were gone?\u201d Percy asks.</p>\n<p>Luke gives him a tired look. \u201cMonsters can\u2019t die, Percy.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yeah, he knows, but that doesn\u2019t mean\u2014\u201cJust humor me for a second,\u201d Percy says. \u201cPlease?\u201d</p>\n<p>And he must look pretty pathetic right now, because Luke only hesitates for a moment before nodding.</p>\n<p>Good. Time for a pop quiz.</p>\n<p>\u201cPicture this.\u201d Percy waves his free hand in the air. \u201cNo monsters. No gods. If you could just\u2014live without worrying about the next myth who\u2019s gonna show up and screw you over, what would you want to do? Who would you want to be?\u201d</p>\n<p>Luke doesn\u2019t say anything.</p>\n<p>\u201cA lawyer?\u201d Percy guesses. \u201cA CEO? An Olympic fencer, a cruise ship captain, a preschool teacher, an actor at a Renaissance fair? Oh, wait, I know, a Broadway\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShut up!\u201d Luke snaps. \u201cA social worker, okay?\u201d</p>\n<p>Yes! Luke does dream of something besides the destruction of Western civilization!</p>\n<p>Wait, what did he just say?\u00a0</p>\n<p>Percy shuts up and hopes his eyebrows are doing a good job at broadcasting his surprise and confusion.</p>\n<p>Luke sighs. Then he explains, \u201cBefore I knew about Camp Half-Blood, I wanted to be a child protection social worker. So I could help demigods whose mortal parents didn\u2019t treat them well.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHow?\u201d Percy asks, curious.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWelfare checks where the kids don\u2019t have to be afraid of being called liars for seeing through the Mist,\u201d Luke says. \u201cAdvice for how to cope with their parents and their powers. Removal, if necessary.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cRemoval to where?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cA community center. A community. A safe place where demigod children can be with people like them and know that they aren\u2019t\u2014\u201d Luke cuts himself off, staring down at the ruined floor.</p>\n<p>Percy keeps pressing. \u201cWould you live there too?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo. That sort of place isn\u2019t meant to be a permanent residence. The goal is integration, learning how to live in the mortal world and how to live well. I always wanted\u2014\u201d Luke thinks for a moment, then smiles wanly. \u201cWell, a townhouse would be best for us. I\u2019d like an ocean view, but it\u2019d also have to be close to a university where Annabeth wants to study, and Thalia would\u2014\u201c</p>\n<p>Luke shuts down again.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Percy realizes that he\u2019s squeezing his hand. Tight.</p>\n<p>After a moment, Luke\u2019s grip loosens. Then he takes a deep breath, staring out at the sea.</p>\n<p>\u201cBut,\u201d he says, \u201cthat\u2019s never going to happen.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt will,\u201d Percy replies, before he realizes that he has nothing to promise Luke with except his words. And Luke has a good reason not to trust his word right now.</p>\n<p>Fortunately, Luke seems too drained to get mad again. He just glances down at Percy, hollow-eyed.</p>\n<p>Percy squeezes his hand. \u201cIt\u2019ll happen, Luke,\u201d he says. \u201cJust wait. I\u2019ll show you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\n<span>As the </span>\n<em>\n<span>Princess Andromeda</span>\n</em>\n<span> approaches Polyphemus\u2019s island, Percy can feel the power of the Golden Fleece, even from the ruined bridge. He stretches, pulling at the raised scar on his neck, and sighs.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Luke inhales slowly, and his jaw relaxes for the first time since he dragged Percy into the bathroom, splashed the blood off his neck, and saw the clotted wound Backbiter left across his throat. Percy took a shower after that, but whatever he did made the cut heal faster on the outside than on the inside, leaving a bumpy white scar. Luke\u2019s been a little on edge ever since.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>It was Percy\u2019s turn to sail, but Luke had been coming in to check on him every fifteen minutes or so. It took Percy an embarrassing amount of time to figure out that he was doing full sweeps of the ship in some sort of drunken crisis. Pacing, instead of sleeping. After that, Percy tried pushing Luke back into the stateroom and rolling him into a blanket burrito, but he took to being burrito-ed with even less grace than Percy, which is to say none at all.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Eventually, they compromised on both staying at the bridge, Luke staring blankly at the sea while Percy monitors the controls. Backbiter still lies discarded on the floor, Percy\u2019s blood staining the blade. That\u2019s definitely a biohazard, but Percy\u2019s had worse, and Luke doesn\u2019t look ready to deal with it right now.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The Fleece seems to be helping him, though, even at a distance. Polyphemus\u2019s island is just a blot of white sand and greenery in the blue water, but Luke\u2019s already perking up.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Can the Fleece cure sleep deprivation and teenage angst? If so, Percy wants in on that.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Once Percy starts steering them towards the back side of the island, Luke turns to him, brow furrowed. \u201cIf you\u2019re not helping Kronos,\u201d he asks, \u201cthen why are we getting the Fleece?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>He doesn\u2019t really sound angry about it anymore. Nice. Percy should\u2019ve spitted himself on Backbiter ages ago.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThe Poseidon cabin is chilly,\u201d Percy tells him. \u201cI want another blanket.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Luke sighs so heavily that Percy\u2019s surprised he doesn\u2019t pull something. \u201cYou know, Percy,\u201d he says, \u201cif you don\u2019t want to answer a question, you can just keep quiet. You don\u2019t have to say something stupid.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cBut then how would I annoy you?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Luke gives Percy a look. The look says </span>\n<em>\n<span>I am very tired in general but especially tired of your shit.</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Percy smiles back.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Then it\u2019s down to business. Percy parks the </span>\n<em>\n<span>Princess Andromeda</span>\n</em>\n<span> by the cliffs that lead up to Polyphemus\u2019s cave, so they\u2019re not very close to the Fleece, but at least the ship is hidden. Even Polyphemus would be able to spot a gigantic yacht sailing towards him.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cSo what\u2019s your plan here?\u201d Luke says.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>They\u2019re on the upper deck, Luke glancing up at the high cliffs then down at the rocks below. He\u2019s wearing his flying shoes, which is good. He also has Backbiter, freshly cleaned, slung across his back, though Percy\u2019s hoping he won\u2019t have to use it.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Maybe Polyphemus is taking a nap in his cave. Please let Polyphemus be taking a nap in his cave. Something about this trip has to go according to plan.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOkay,\u201d Percy says, \u201cthere\u2019s a tree surrounded by carnivorous sheep on the other side of the island, and on\u2014\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cCarnivorous sheep?\u201d Luke seems intrigued.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Nope. \u201cWe are not fighting the carnivorous sheep,\u201d Percy says sternly. \u201cThey\u2019re piranhas with wool.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Luke rolls his eyes. \u201cI wasn\u2019t going to say we should fight the sheep, but they might be useful for\u2014\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThey\u2019re humongous bloodthirsty fluff balls. They\u2019re only useful if you\u2019re tired of having skin,\u201d Percy points out. \u201cAnd they\u2019re guarding the tree that the Fleece is on anyway, so we can\u2019t\u2014\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Percy gets interrupted again, but not by Luke this time.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>By a scream.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Percy whips his head around, staring at the top of the cliff.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>For a split second, he thinks\u2014hopes\u2014that it\u2019s one of Polyphemus\u2019s sheep, hollering about not having enough grass or something. Giant piranha sheep should be able to scream like people, too, right?\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>But, Percy is too familiar with the sound of someone crying out in fear.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>No. This can\u2019t\u2014</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThat voice,\u201d Luke says. His shoulders are stiff. \u201cIt almost sounded like\u2014\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAnnabeth,\u201d Percy whispers. \u201cPolyphemus has Annabeth.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Fuck. How could he let this happen again?</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Percy starts to dash for the edge of the ship, but then Luke catches his arm. \u201cWhy would Annabeth be h\u2014\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>There\u2019s no time. \u201cShe\u2019s in danger! We need to get up there fast!\u201d Percy tries to shake Luke off, fails, and begins dragging him along like a very annoying and well-armed anchor.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Thankfully, Luke seems willing to take Percy\u2019s word on this one. Or maybe he\u2019s finally learned that there are things he doesn\u2019t want to risk. After stumbling two feet forward, he scoops Percy up, then cries, \u201cMaia!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Now, Percy actually likes flying, though being cooped up on a magical flying warship with six other demigods and a crazy old satyr does take a bit of the shine off the whole thing. This doesn\u2019t mean that he appreciates Luke picking him up like he\u2019s a little kid and zooming up the cliff at what feels like Mach 1.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Maybe he flails. Briefly.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>But, Luke doesn\u2019t get a sneaker to the face, so Percy thinks he\u2019s handling everything pretty well, all things considered.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>And then they can see the entrance to Polyphemus\u2019s cave, and all concerns about bruised dignity drain out of Percy\u2019s mind.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The first thing his eyes go to is Grover, lying next to the fire heating Polyphemus\u2019s cooking pot. His right arm and shoulder look like they\u2019ve been mangled by a school of giant piranhas. He\u2019s not moving.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Percy gags, and it\u2019s only partly at the smell of blood and burnt flesh.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Luke places his hand over Percy\u2019s nose and mouth. \u201cShh,\u201d he whispers. \u201dHe\u2019s alive. Annabeth must\u2019ve cauterized his wounds. But why would she\u2014\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Any \u201cwhy\u201d question Luke might\u2019ve asked is answered by Polyphemus, stomping up the path and shaking his fist like Smelly Gabe when the game on TV isn\u2019t going his way. Then a Yankees cap falls to the dirt, and Annabeth appears, snarling, her face red. Polyphemus is holding her upside down by the legs.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Luke\u2019s fingers are digging painfully into Percy\u2019s shoulder, frozen and unyielding as steel. It\u2019s hard to care about that, though, when his blood is turning into ice.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Polyphemus isn\u2019t blind enough to shrug off invisible demigods becoming visible again. He raises Annabeth to his one cloudy eye.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou a satyr, too?\u201d he asks, squinting at her face. \u201cSatyrs are good eating.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Annabeth doesn\u2019t answer. Instead, she does a hanging sit up and stabs Polyphemus in the pinky.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The good thing is that he howls and drops her. The bad part is that he drops her head first onto the rocks.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>And she stops moving.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Percy doesn\u2019t even have time to absorb this new wave of horror before Luke unceremoniously plonks him onto the ledge.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI\u2019m going to kill him,\u201d Luke says, deceptively calm. Then he swoops down to do just that.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Percy\u2019s brain doesn\u2019t have the space to worry about Luke right now. His thoughts are just buzzing and white noise, waves crashing into a stormy sea. He dives off the cliff, rolling to spare his ankles and wrists, and dodges Polyphemus\u2019s stumbling feet to sprint over to Annabeth.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>She\u2019s breathing, but her eyes are half lidded. Percy can see the whites peeking out. Her palms are red and blistered. There\u2019s blood in her hair.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Please, no. This can\u2019t\u2014</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Polyphemus\u2019s heel lands too hard, too close, and Percy braces himself over Annabeth to shield her from the chunks of stone blasted their way.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>There\u2019s no time for denial. Trying not to think about spinal injuries and brain damage, Percy picks Annabeth up and moves as steadily as he can towards Grover. If he could think of a safe place, he would carry them both there, but he\u2019s not smart enough or fast enough or strong enough to keep his friends out of danger, apparently. The only thing he can do is keep them together.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>And fight.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Luke\u2019s gotten a head start on that. He\u2019s zigzagging around Polyphemus\u2019s head, slashing at the base of his neck, his forehead, his eye. Polyphemus\u2019s face is scratched and bloody, but he\u2019s just stomping around harder, not faltering.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Actually, he\u2019s yelling about grinding Luke into sheep chow while slapping at him like he\u2019s just a really murderous mosquito. Which isn\u2019t ideal.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Percy joins in by stabbing at Polyphemus\u2019s knees and ankles when he\u2019s not dodging around his feet, trying to push him back down the path, away from the fire. But even with Percy and Luke both fighting\u2014or maybe because they\u2019re both fighting\u2014they\u2019re not making a lot of progress. It feels like they\u2019re trying to kill Polyphemus with a thousand paper cuts.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Too slow. This is taking too long. Percy doesn\u2019t\u2014They never killed Polyphemus either, did they? They managed to trick him, knock him over, outrun him, but they didn\u2019t hurt him in any way that mattered.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Who knows what it\u2019ll take to really bring him down this time?</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Backbiter flashes overhead, and Polyphemus howls, but he doesn\u2019t stumble. Percy swipes at his calf, leaving a long gash. Nothing changes. It\u2019s not enough.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Percy glances back at where Annabeth and Grover are lying, as frozen as the dead, and he knows\u2014</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cLuke!\u201d he yells. \u201cStop fighting! You have to go get the Fleece!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhat?\u201d Luke zips out of the way of Polyphemus\u2019s palm. \u201cNo! I\u2014\u201c</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>No time. Percy stabs Riptide into the back of Polyphemus\u2019s knee, and he growls, pulling away from Luke to slap at his legs.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAnnabeth and Grover are hurt!\u201d Percy says, leaping back. \u201cThey\u2019re dying! They\u2019ll die!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Luke plunges forward, aiming for Polyphemus\u2019s neck, but then he has to swerve to avoid his swinging elbow. \u201cThen why don\u2019t you\u2014\u201c</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>There\u2019s no time! \u201cYou\u2019re the one wearing the stupid flying shoes!\u201d Percy screams, so loud that it feels like his throat is tearing. He can\u2019t help it. He\u2019s suddenly furious at everything, furious at Luke, furious at himself for needing someone else to save his friends again. Someone who he can\u2019t even get to </span>\n<em>\n<span>listen</span>\n</em>\n<span> to him\u2014</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Percy dives, narrowly avoiding getting squashed like an ant.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Okay. Obviously, being mad at Luke isn\u2019t going to help him right now. Polyphemus only needs one blow to end this fight, and Percy\u2019s vulnerable like this, weaving between his feet, especially with Luke up above making him jerk around unpredictably.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Except Luke\u2019s not doing that, because right now he\u2019s just hovering in midair like an idiot, glancing quickly between Polyphemus and Annabeth and Grover, Backbiter only half-raised.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cBut\u2014\u201c he says.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Holy Hades.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>What the fuck does he think he\u2019s doing?!</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cDon\u2019t just stand there!\u201d Percy yells. \u201cMake a choice!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Luke does just stand there, and he does not make a choice. Percy jabs Riptide under Polyphemus\u2019s moldy big toenail\u2014so gross\u2014so he can\u2019t swat Luke out of the air like the dumb hover fly he apparently is.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cLuke!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>And the sound of Percy calling his name combined with Polyphemus\u2019s yelp must finally be loud enough to snap Luke out of it, because he jolts like Thalia just electrocuted him and flies out of Polyphemus\u2019s swinging range.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Luke takes a breath. Then another.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>And then he lowers Backbiter.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Finally.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Luke sweeps down by Percy, jaw tight, eyes gleaming, and says, \u201cLead him away from them. I\u2019ll come help you once they\u2019re stable. And don\u2019t you dare die, Percy.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Percy bites down on the urge to reply \u201cDon\u2019t tell me what to do\u201d and says, \u201cFine, just go!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Luke zips off, so quick that the breeze follows him, carrying the scent of blood and burning with it.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Percy gives Polyphemus\u2019s foot one last stab before backing away, Riptide up and ready.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOkay, Ugly,\u201d he taunts. \u201cI\u2019m Nobody, and if you want to kill me, you better be ready for the worst pedicure of your entire life!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Polyphemus roars. Probably not about the pedicure part. But, it doesn\u2019t matter, because he\u2019s charging at Percy either way.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Without Luke distracting Polyphemus, Percy is the target of all his swipes and blows, which means he\u2019s doing a lot of jumping and dodging and rolling. It kind of feels like he\u2019s on a really deadly version of </span>\n<em>\n<span>Wipeout</span>\n</em>\n<span>, but at least it\u2019s easy for him to lead Polyphemus towards the chasm that bisects the island like this.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>By the time Annabeth and Grover are out of sight, Percy\u2019s ready to go all out on attacking. It\u2019s not really the smart thing to do. He\u2019s sweating, his arms and legs burn, and he\u2019s covered in dust and dirt. Annabeth would probably want him to continue feinting and eventually trick Polyphemus into falling onto the rocks under the bridge. But, Annabeth isn\u2019t here right now.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Polyphemus hurt his friends, so Percy\u2019s going to take him down and enjoy it.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>And he does.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>It\u2019s exhilarating, letting himself go like this, pushing all his frustration and fear and anger into his blade, into Polyphemus\u2019s flesh. It\u2019s not like training in the woods or sparring with Luke. Percy isn\u2019t even thinking about what he\u2019s doing anymore. All that\u2019s going through his head is </span>\n<em>\n<span>he hurt them he almost killed them they might still die he\u2019s gonna pay.</span>\n</em>\n<span>\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The fury burns him bare. His body moves on instinct. His blade is an arc of destruction.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<span>You just...with a sword...you just\u2014</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Percy barely even notices Luke passing overhead. It feels like a dam inside of him is breaking. Polyphemus yelps and howls like a wounded animal, stumbling back, getting knocked down and down by Riptide.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Percy might be laughing. He can\u2019t tell.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Now he understands why Luke didn\u2019t want to stop.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>By the time Percy comes back to himself, the tip of Riptide is hovering an inch away from Polyphemus\u2019s cloudy eye. Polyphemus is cowering next to the bridge, covered with gashes and the red of budding bruises. He\u2019s shaking. They\u2019re both shaking, actually.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cDon\u2019t kill me!\u201d Polyphemus whimpers.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Percy doesn\u2019t say anything.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>He wants to. He should.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>But.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>There are worse things to suffer than death.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Without looking away from Polyphemus or letting his sword waver, Percy lifts his left hand, and he presses the base of his palm to the blade. He\u2019s not used to hurting himself on purpose, so it takes some effort, but eventually he gets a good flow going.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>As his blood pools onto the dirt, slowly sinking into the earth, Percy says, \u201cKnock knock! I got you a guinea pig!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>A pause.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Nothing happens.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Hey. Percy knows she\u2019s awake. He smears his blood out more with a sneaker, drips it in an arc, stomps on the ground a little. Does he need to spell it out in Morse code or something?</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhat is a guinea pig?\u201d asks Polyphemus.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Percy\u2019s too busy to answer that. Besides, he\u2019ll find out soon enough.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>After jabbing Riptide another centimeter forward to dissuade Polyphemus from fidgeting, Percy stares unblinkingly at the dark earth for another moment, picturing his blood seeping down, down, down, down.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Still nothing.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Fine then. Percy will do it himself. He already knew he couldn\u2019t rely on a goddess to solve his problems anyway.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>So, Percy closes his eyes and thinks about the darkness and the cold, red clouds and black cliffs, the water screaming and burning and sobbing and devouring, falling into the heart of the earth, the earth reaching up\u2014There she is\u2014the earth reaching back, and he points his bleeding palm at the ground, and he pushes, and he </span>\n<em>\n<span>shoves\u2014</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>You should never take your eyes off of your enemy, even if he\u2019s been knocked down.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Good thing Percy doesn\u2019t have to learn this lesson again.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>When Percy opens his eyes, the first thing he sees is Polyphemus\u2019s outstretched fist, ready to smash him into a pancake. But it hasn\u2019t reached him, and it never will, because the ground underneath Polyphemus\u2019s feet has cracked open.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>And below, there\u2019s nothing but a void.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Polyphemus, eye wide and blank, falls into the tear in the earth, too surprised to even scream.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Percy inches over to the pit. \u201cRemember to submit your complaints to the nearest suggestion box,\u201d he says into the endless black. \u201cYour feedback is valuable to us.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>And then, with a stream of his blood and a clench of his gut, he slams the fissure shut.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The ground is seamless. The sun is warm. The birds chirp, the sheep bleat. It\u2019s like nothing even happened.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Percy caps Riptide with trembling hands. He wants to throw up. It feels like someone\u2019s taken a baseball bat to all his internal organs.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>But, he has to admit it. She was right. This way is a lot cleaner.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Not counting the blood he\u2019s getting everywhere, of course.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Percy grips his left wrist tight. He tries to take a deep breath, but his lungs feel heavy. His heart pounds against his ribcage, quick and painful.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>That seems bad. He\u2019s sweating a lot, too. He should probably try that thing he did to scab his neck after Luke decided not to take his head off, but right now, Percy feels like he\u2019s more jello than muscle. He knows that he can either do the thing and black out, or he can go back and check on Annabeth and Grover.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>It\u2019s not even a choice.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Dizzy, Percy staggers up the path as quick as he can. You know, he thought that with Luke and him both on board, getting the Golden Fleece would be a piece of cake, but it seems like everything Percy does is just destined to go wrong in some way. It\u2019s like he can\u2019t take his eyes off anyone without them getting hurt.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Wait, no. Destiny\u2019s already gone on vacation. Percy\u2019s just really bad at keeping his friends safe, that\u2019s all. He\u2019s just\u2014screwing up again. And again and again.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>It\u2019s cold. That\u2019s weird. Why is it so cold?</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Percy\u2019s watching the trail of smoke that marks the finish line of his terrible hike, so he doesn\u2019t notice Luke until he\u2019s roping an arm around his waist and keeping him from face planting into the dirt.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Luke is breathing hard, and Backbiter is in his left hand. He hasn\u2019t had time to sheath it yet. He\u2019s also shaking a little, his arm a band of warmth across Percy\u2019s back. Actually, it\u2019s kind of hard to tell, because Percy\u2019s shaking, too. The adrenaline is draining out of him fast.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>But, Percy still has enough energy to glance up at Luke and spy the edge of his grin, too wide for joy but too genuine for anything except relief.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Percy watches his scar crinkle and wonders, absently, if he\u2019ll count this as a successful quest. Not something to cover up his last one but a balm, to push the memory back.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Kronos will never touch him. The scar will fade.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cPolyphemus?\u201d Luke asks, half-dragging and half-carrying Percy the rest of the way back.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cFell,\u201d Percy says. He can\u2019t focus on anything but Annabeth and Grover lying by the fire, the Golden Fleece draped over them both. They look better. Not as pale. Or maybe that\u2019s just the flames.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThe Fleece is healing them,\u201d Luke says. \u201cThey\u2019ll be okay.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The relief washes over Percy like cool water, and he shivers.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>That was too close. If they\u2019d gotten here a minute later, a second later...</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Something touches Percy\u2019s hand. He would flinch, but he doesn\u2019t have the energy. It\u2019s just Luke anyway, peeling Percy\u2019s fingers away from the cut on his wrist. And isn\u2019t that strange, feeling reassured by the thought of Luke.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Guess you really can\u2019t be trapped on a yacht with only your (ex) mortal enemy for company and come out of it exactly the same.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThis is from a blade,\u201d Luke notes. He looks at Percy, eyes narrowed. \u201cPolyphemus didn\u2019t have a blade.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Uh. \u201cThat\u2019s. Weird,\u201d Percy forces out. He hopes Luke doesn\u2019t press. He\u2019s too lightheaded to think up a plausible\u2014or funny\u2014explanation, and talking is kind of a chore right now. His tongue feels like a deadweight anchor.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Luckily, massive blood loss seems to be a good enough excuse for not explaining, even by Luke\u2019s standards, because he just places Percy\u2019s hand back around his wrist and presses on his shoulders until he plops onto the ground, barely missing the fire pit.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cFine,\u201d Luke says,\u00a0 \u201cBut we will be revisiting this later.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Then he orders, \u201cGet under the Fleece.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Um. Percy stares blankly. He\u2019s pretty sure even magical blankets have maximum capacities, and he\u2019s not going to risk Grover\u2019s arm or Annabeth\u2019s brain over something he did to himself.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Besides, he doesn\u2019t\u2014You can\u2019t make a manhole to Tartarus and come out of it completely clean. He can still feel the cold lacing his bones like frost, the darkness swirling in the pool of his gut. He doesn\u2019t want to touch any of his friends\u2014Annabeth especially\u2014when he\u2019s like this.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Percy will fix this on his own. He just. He needs some time to pull himself together.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Percy tries explaining this to Luke, but he must be further gone than he thought, because it just comes out as, \u201cNn\u2026\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Luke raises an eyebrow, unimpressed. \u201cYour lips are blue,\u201d he says.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>And then he pushes Percy down, shoves him next to Annabeth, and rearranges the Golden Fleece until the three of them are covered. He even tucks them in, and Percy would feel really embarrassed if he wasn\u2019t too busy feeling tired. They probably look like three kids sharing a blanket after a really unfortunate camping trip.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Percy starts to wiggle himself out, but then Luke sits down by his head. And his expression looks serious enough that Percy doesn\u2019t think he\u2019ll take an escape attempt kindly.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Fine. The blue lips thing doesn\u2019t sound great anyway, even if you are what you eat.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Annabeth\u2019s hand is brushing his. Percy uses the last of his strength to turn his head and look at her face, peaceful and painless. Even though he can\u2019t see the healing going on beneath her skin, he still feels the need to watch. It feels like if he turns away from his friends for even a second more, they\u2019re going to be in danger again, and he won\u2019t be able to keep them safe. Again.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>There won\u2019t always be a magical healing blanket on the tree next door.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Suddenly, there\u2019s a hand over his eyes, blocking his view.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cSleep,\u201d Luke says.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Percy wants to protest, but he knows that he needs to regain his strength if he\u2019s going to be useful. And it is very warm near the fire and with his friends beside him.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>They\u2019re healing. Polyphemus is gone. Luke won\u2019t let them be eaten by any carnivorous sheep.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Percy closes his eyes.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>A little nap won\u2019t hurt, right?</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Two seconds later, he\u2019s slipping into the darkness.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u2014\u2014</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Percy wakes up to a rock digging into his back and hair tickling his face. He blinks a couple times, trying to get his eyes to focus, before lifting his hand.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Annabeth pulls him up so that they\u2019re sitting shoulder to shoulder. \u201cWell,\u201d she says, \u201cthe zombie lives.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Percy leans over. He gives her a hug.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Annabeth breathes out sharply, and Percy immediately lets go, worried about broken ribs, but then she\u2019s squeezing him twice as hard, and Grover\u2019s bleating \u201cPercy!\u201d and crashing into both of them, almost knocking them into the fire, so any caution that Percy\u2019s put into this hug is all wasted anyway.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>It\u2019s great.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Percy feels safe in their arms. For the first time in what feels like forever, he lets himself relax.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>And he\u2019s still not happy that Annabeth and Grover are here, but he is glad that they\u2019re with him.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>After a middle school-appropriate amount of hug time\u2014during which Percy slowly becomes aware that Luke is watching them very carefully\u2014Percy extracts himself from the tangle of limbs.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAre you guys okay?\u201d he asks.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYup,\u201d Grover says, rotating his shoulder, \u201cjust like new. Though I think I lost a bit of hair on my\u2014\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Annabeth decides that learning about Grover\u2019s unfortunate hair loss comes second to her demonstrating her okay-ness by punching Percy in the arm. Hard.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOw!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI can\u2019t believe you left camp to find the Golden Fleece, and you didn\u2019t. Take. Me!\u201d Annabeth growls, punctuating each of her statements with another punch. She nearly knocks Percy onto his back again.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWell,\u201d Percy says, quickly scooting out of punching range, \u201cI can\u2019t believe you tried to fight a cyclops alone! You could\u2019ve died!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou could\u2019ve died!\u201d Annabeth counters. She\u2019s scooting after him, fists still clenched. \u201cYou could\u2019ve\u2014\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Luke steps between them and grabs the collars of their shirts, hoisting them to their feet and separating them like he\u2019s wrangling kittens. \u201cI\u2019m sure we can all agree that you both could\u2019ve died horribly,\u201d he says. \u201cPlease don\u2019t reinjure each other. Unless you want to spend more time cuddling under the Fleece?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Annabeth flushes. Probably out of rage.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Hey, did Percy survive sailing a cruise ship, living with Luke, and fighting Polyphemus only to be murdered by a thirteen-year-old version of his (past? future?) girlfriend?</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>That seems appropriate, considering how his life is going.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Meanwhile, Grover is examining the Golden Fleece. \u201cIt feels like Pan,\u201d he mutters. \u201cIt must\u2019ve been luring satyrs here for\u2014for centuries! No wonder they never found him!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>At that, Luke\u2019s eyes glint dangerously. He turns to Grover, letting Percy and Annabeth go. \u201cBy the way, Grover,\u201d he says pleasantly, \u201cI was wondering if you could explain why you and Annabeth are on this particular island in the middle of the Sea of Monsters with minimal supplies and no backup\u2026\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Grover gulps.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Percy and Annabeth exchange a look. Then Annabeth grabs Percy\u2019s hand, and they escape to the wall of the ledge, abandoning Grover to Luke\u2019s tender mercies.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Percy doesn\u2019t feel guilty. Grover\u2019s a big satyr. He\u2019ll be fine.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Well, he won\u2019t die.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>And Percy can\u2019t even say the same for himself, because Annabeth has thrown down his hand and is now looking at him like she\u2019s trying to decide which part of him will work best as a new sheath for her dagger.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Percy tells her. And he is. Probably not for the thing she wants him to be sorry for, but still.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Annabeth\u2019s shoulders relax a little. \u201cYou do this again,\u201d she says, \u201cand you won\u2019t have to worry about dying, because I\u2019ll hunt you down and kill you myself.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cShouldn\u2019t I be even more worried about dying then? Ow!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Percy rubs his arm, pouting exaggeratedly. Annabeth rolls her eyes.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cJust bring me along next time, Seaweed Brain,\u201d she says. \u201cWe\u2019re friends. I\u2019ll always fight by your side.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>By the time Annabeth\u2019s done talking, her eyes have shifted from Percy\u2019s face to the rocks by his sneakers, but Percy can tell that she means it.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>She always meant it. Even after he stopped deserving it.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThanks, Annabeth,\u201d Percy says. Now he can\u2019t look at her either.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Luckily, they only have to weather a couple seconds of standing in an awkward silence and not looking at each other before Luke is waving them over, Grover hunched over miserably beside him.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cCome on,\u201d Luke says, folding the Fleece into his arms. \u201cLet\u2019s get off this island.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Percy pats Grover\u2019s shoulder. Seems like Luke didn\u2019t go easy on him. But then, before Percy can say anything comforting, Grover\u2019s stomach growls. Loudly.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Honestly, Percy would\u2019ve thought that another monster was approaching if he hadn\u2019t seen him blush.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Annabeth smirks. Luke glances back, eyebrows raised.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cUh,\u201d Grover stammers. \u201cDo any of you happen to have any food?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Percy laughs.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Good old Grover. Never change.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>As Luke sighs, shaking his head, Percy throws an arm around Grover\u2019s shoulders. \u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019ve got plenty of cans on the yacht.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cA yacht?\u201d Annabeth asks.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYeah,\u201d Luke says. \u201cWait, how did you guys get here?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Annabeth hesitates. \u201cWell\u2014\u201c</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou hijacked Clarisse\u2019s ship?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Standing before the </span>\n<em>\n<span>CSS Birmingham,</span>\n</em>\n<span> Percy can\u2019t tell if Luke is disapproving or proud. But, judging by the smile he\u2019s trying to tamp down, he\u2019s leaning towards proud.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cTechnically, no,\u201d Annabeth says. Despite this, she looks very satisfied with herself.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWe just captured Clarisse,\u201d Grover explains.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Oh, so they just captured Clarisse. Okay. Cool.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Wait.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWha\u2014\u201d Percy starts.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou haven\u2019t captured shit, idiots,\u201d Clarisse calls, stomping across the deck. \u201cI\u2019ve just been restrained.\u201d She shakes her bound hands at them aggressively. \u201cOnce I get out of these ropes, your asses are mine.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>If possible, Luke looks even more amused.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNice to see you too, Clarisse,\u201d Percy says.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cPrissy.\u201d Clarisse glares. \u201cDamn, I was hoping you were dead. Would\u2019ve saved me a lot of trouble.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHow could I deprive you of the chance to kill me yourself?\u201d Percy asks, trying to sound more offhand than he\u2019s being. He knows that Clarisse doesn\u2019t actually need her hands free to kill him, even though she probably wouldn\u2019t do it with so many witnesses around.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Though it is weird that Annabeth and Grover didn\u2019t tie up her legs, especially since she flat-out told them that Ares ordered her to perform murder. If Percy was feeling optimistic, he\u2019d guess that Annabeth and Grover might\u2019ve made a deal with her, but they\u2019re flanking him a little too closely for that. And Percy never feels optimistic anymore.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>For the barest millisecond, Clarisse looks uncomfortable. Then she snorts dismissively. \u201cYou aren\u2019t worth my time,\u201d she says.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>And before Percy can figure out what that means, Luke steps in front of him, examining the steamship. \u201cDon\u2019t you have any crew?\u201d he asks.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWe were attacked by Charybdis,\u201d Clarisse shrugs. \u201cNo other survivors. Unfortunate.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cCharybdis?\u201d Percy says. \u201cI thought we ki\u2014Ow!\u201c</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Percy turns to stare at Annabeth, who lifts her foot off of his toes without looking at him. Then he turns back to Clarisse, who blinks at him slowly.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIt was,\u201d she says, \u201ca very unfortunate monster attack. Right, guys?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cRight!\u201d Grover says quickly.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>When Percy glances at Annabeth, she meets his eyes and nods meaningfully.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>A tense silence.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Uh. They didn\u2019t do what Percy thinks they did, did they?</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201c...Okay,\u201d Luke says, looking between them, his eyebrows raised. \u201cWe might as well just take the yacht then. Get all your stuff. Let\u2019s plan on taking off in two minutes. I don\u2019t like the way those sheep are looking at us.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u2014\u2014</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Luke makes Annabeth and Grover untie Clarisse, reasoning that they don\u2019t need to restrain her since they\u2019re not hijacking her ship anymore. Annabeth and Grover protest, and even Clarisse seems reluctant\u2014which Luke obviously finds confusing\u2014but since none of them will explain why they still want her tied up, Clarisse regains the use of her hands.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>There isn\u2019t any rope burn on her wrists. Not even a red mark.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhat\u2019re you looking at?\u201d Clarisse growls.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYour manicure,\u201d Percy replies. \u201cDid you get it done at the Kindly Ones\u2019 Nails and Spa?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Clarisse cracks her knuckles. Then Grover cuts in between them and drags Percy away, babbling something about cans.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Neither Grover nor Annabeth seem willing to let Percy near Clarisse, actually. Which is nice, but also annoying, because Percy needs to stay by Clarisse if he wants to catch Ares visiting the ship to yell at her for not murdering a fellow camper. That seems like the kind of asshole thing he would do, and Clarisse seems to think so, too. With each day that passes, she looks more and more nervous.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Though it\u2019s also possible that she\u2019s just cracking under the pressure of being stuck on a yacht with Percy.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cGo away, Jackson! Stop stalking me!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI can\u2019t help it. It\u2019s a small ship.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIt\u2019s a fucking gigantic yacht!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Eventually, Annabeth tells, and Luke makes Percy help him at the bridge while Clarisse and Annabeth pulverize the mall mannequins under Grover\u2019s extremely anxious supervision. At first, Percy\u2019s sort of worried about Ares showing up when he\u2019s not there, but then he reminds himself that Ares is the type of chicken shit who asks his teenage daughter to kill the thirteen year old who kicked his ass last summer, so he probably won\u2019t visit a cruise ship with that thirteen year old on it anyway.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>And he doesn\u2019t. Still, Percy considers starting to keep track of all the gods who have it out for him, so he doesn\u2019t have to worry about unexpected guests and murder attempts. Then he realizes that just means keeping track of all the gods who\u2019ve met him.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>That\u2019s much easier.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>By the time they dock at New York, Percy and Luke have unearthed the yacht\u2019s instruction manual from one of the dented cabinets and have thereby figured out how to actually sail fast, Annabeth and Clarisse have shredded basically the entire indoor mall, and Grover has developed a nervous tick under his right eye. All in all, it\u2019s a smooth trip home. Percy\u2019s proud of them all.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Not everyone is happy to be back, though. Luke grows more and more tense as they approach Half-Blood Hill. It\u2019s a gloom that not even the Golden Fleece, which he\u2019s carrying in his arms, seems able to cure.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Honestly, he\u2019s making Percy nervous, too, even though Percy knows what\u2019s coming. Last time he and Annabeth left camp without permission, their return was mostly ignored. And there\u2019s nothing really bad about being ignored. At many points in his life, Percy would\u2019ve paid the gods and titans and monsters to ignore him.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>But, Percy isn\u2019t sure how Luke will react. Even if he\u2019s less murderous than he was when they left, Percy still doesn\u2019t think he\u2019ll be happy just sliding back into his role of counselor, sword fighting instructor, and all around nice demigod.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>He\u2019s changed and moved forward. What if he gets frustrated that the world hasn\u2019t kept up? What if he becomes lonely?</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Fortunately, it turns out that Percy didn\u2019t need to worry about any of that.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>They don\u2019t even make it past the Big House before they\u2019re being swarmed.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>At first, Percy startles, convinced that Ares has somehow coerced all his children into coming to murder him, but then he realizes that Clarisse\u2019s siblings are just welcoming her back. They\u2019re also checking that she\u2019s okay in the family tradition: with lots of shoulder punching and back slapping and hugs that are tackles in disguise.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The rest of them aren\u2019t spared this fate either. There are a lot of hands and a lot of arms and a lot of people saying a version of \u201cThank the gods you guys are safe!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Annabeth seems disgruntled by her older siblings\u2019s fussing, but Percy can tell that she\u2019s holding back a smile. Grover pats Percy on the back before trotting off to the forest. Percy understands. Grover has important news, and the Council of Cloven Elders can\u2019t wait.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Then Percy turns just in time to see Luke get dogpiled by the entire Hermes cabin. They\u2019re all trying to talk to him at the same time, laughing like he\u2019s just pulled off the best prank in all of Camp Half-Blood history.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Luke looks so surprised that Percy can\u2019t help but grin.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>It\u2019s good to be back.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Eventually, Beckendorf and Silena push their way over, Beckendorf digging Luke out from underneath the campers and helping him to his feet.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>After Silena gets a good look at Luke\u2019s face, she laughs, too. \u201cDid you really think we wouldn\u2019t miss you?\u201d she says. \u201cThe entire Hermes cabin\u2019s been running wild since you left.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNot just the Hermes cabin,\u201d Beckendorf adds. \u201cThe whole camp\u2019s been restless. And then once Annabeth and Clarisse left, it really got crazy! At one point, the counselors started debating whether to send out search teams or interrogate the Oracle. Man, I\u2019ve never seen Chiron so flustered\u2014\u201c</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWe weren\u2019t gone that long\u2014\u201c Luke points out.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>But, Silena\u2019s already whirling on Percy, pointing a finger at his nose. \u201cI thought you said it was a ten day cruise! You\u2019ve been gone for weeks! We\u2019ve finished four of the arts and crafts projects already!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cFour?\u201d Percy says, while Luke explains, \u201cTime works differently in the Sea of Monsters.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou went on a cruise to the Sea of Monsters?!\u201d Silena exclaims.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cFour,\u201d Beckendorf winks. \u201cPretty fast, huh? Once we finish the...specific craft projects, we\u2019ve been planning on building projects with more stories, for people who aren\u2019t\u2014or who don\u2019t want to live in...specific housing. If that\u2019s okay with you two,\u201d he adds, glancing between Luke and Percy.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWait\u2014\u201d Annabeth shoulders her way into the conversation. \u201cYou guys are the ones in charge of the houses? I thought\u2014\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cDon\u2019t ask me,\u201d Percy says, raising his hands. \u201cI\u2019m just a naiad coordinator. Luke\u2019s the brains of this operation.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t a cruise,\u201d Luke tells Silena. \u201cWe were just on a cruise ship\u2014Wait, what?\u201c He turns to Percy and Beckendorf.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>But, Percy\u2019s dealing with more important stuff right now. Like escaping Annabeth.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201c\u2014I knew those designs looked familiar! Percy, did you give my rough drafts to the naiads? You should have told me! I could have put\u2014\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cMultiple story buildings,\u201d Beckendorf repeats. \u201cAnd nonspecific housing.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Percy backs away and almost trips over Michael Yew. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to get you in trouble\u2014Ow, ow, stop hitting me!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNo, Beckendorf\u2014\u201d Luke is saying. \u201cI mean, yes about the projects. Multiple stories would be great. I don\u2019t know why we never insisted on expanding the Hermes cabin. And I think nonspecific housing is a good idea, too, especially considering how many people don\u2019t want to live with their siblings for the rest of their lives, but you have to keep in mind the space\u2014\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Once Percy feels like he may never recover full use of his arms, Annabeth leaves him alone, hurrying towards another Athena cabin kid while muttering about support columns. Percy takes this opportunity to duck out of the crowd, heading for the glint of gold he can see hiding in the tall grass.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Two paces away from the flock of campers, the Golden Fleece lies abandoned on the ground. Percy picks it up, dusts off a dirty footprint, and starts climbing up Half-Blood Hill, leaving the chatter behind him.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Thalia\u2019s tree towers above him, healthy and green. Percy eyes the upper branches, wondering if there\u2019s a way to hide the Fleece between the needles until Peleus can come guard it. Or maybe they should just tell everyone that the Fleece is a fake, so no one will really want to steal it. After all, there\u2019s nothing like a full grown dragon to announce to the world that your glittery gold blanket is the real deal.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>It\u2019s only when Percy hears someone calling his name that he turns to look back.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cPercy!\u201d Luke repeats, jogging up the hill. His hair is disheveled, cheeks red. He\u2019s grinning.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Good. This is the Luke that Thalia deserved to see, all those years ago and never in the future.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou know,\u201d Luke says as he draws closer, \u201cfor a Big Three kid who can\u2019t take three steps without getting into trouble, you sure are slippery. Why did you tell Beckendorf I was in charge of the\u2014Percy?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Percy glances up at him. Luke\u2019s staring at the Fleece in his arms, his smile fading.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cPercy,\u201d he says slowly. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cShowing you,\u201d Percy says.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>And then he reaches up and drapes the Golden Fleece onto Thalia\u2019s tree.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Percy takes two steps back, so he\u2019s standing side by side with Luke.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>For one second, nothing happens.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Then\u2014</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Well, it turns out that when the Fleece doesn\u2019t have to cure a deadly poison first, it actually works pretty fast. Which is good, because if it didn\u2019t, Percy would be feeling pretty embarrassed right now.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Instead, he feels the rush of magic in the air and the rise of something in his chest as Thalia appears at the foot of the tree. She\u2019s lying down, eyes closed, face peaceful, like she\u2019s just been asleep for the past six years.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Like it was all just a nightmare.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Luke doesn\u2019t move. The voices of the campers fade away, and the world goes still and silent. Percy listens to his breathing stutter and grow ragged.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The magic lingers like early morning fog, gradually being chased away by the warm sun.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Then Thalia\u2019s hand twitches, and her eyelids flutter. Luke makes a choking noise.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>He rushes forward, pulls her into his lap, braces her head on his shoulder.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cLuke?\u201d Thalia says, her hand slowly rising to his face.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThalia,\u201d Luke whispers. \u201cThalia.\u201d He repeats her name like it\u2019s a prayer.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cStrangest dream\u2026\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI can\u2019t believe it. I can\u2019t believe\u2014Is it really\u2014\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cDying.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNo,\u201d Luke says, voice rough. \u201cNo. You\u2019re okay, Thalia. You\u2019re safe. It\u2019s alright. Everything is alright now\u2026\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Percy turns away, letting them have a moment of privacy. He stares out at the camp, at the campers who\u2019re starting to notice something going on, at the new houses that trail out to the lake.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Suddenly, he can see the future rolling out before him.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Now that Annabeth knows Camp Half-Blood is being designed to her specifications, she\u2019ll be drawing up bigger and better buildings all the time; Percy will have to make sure he or someone else reminds her to eat. Beckendorf will continue making beds to put people into, and he\u2019ll probably recruit his entire cabin into the effort by virtue of being Charlie Beckendorf. Silena will delegate and coordinate and set up a team that\u2019s dedicated to protecting nymphs from harassment in exchange for all the help they\u2019ve offered so far. Maybe she\u2019ll even open a branch of her dad\u2019s chocolate shop here, once there\u2019s a space. Badgered by the cult of demigods who believe in the power of his magical eye, Ethan will develop a systematic way to identify godly parents as he crosses more and more names off the list Percy gave him; Percy will freely offer him very questionable advice. Maybe that can be his restoration of balance.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Luke will help Thalia process the six years that she spent covered with more pine needles than anyone was comfortable with, and Thalia won\u2019t let Luke brood about Kronos or revenge or the destruction of Western civilization. Between her, the revitalized Hermes cabin, and the new arts and crafts projects, they have a pretty good chance of convincing Luke that the world he dreams about might just be the one he lives in now.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>And Percy? He\u2019ll watch over everyone and train and train and train, so that he\u2019ll never make the same mistakes again. He won\u2019t put another demigod in danger. No more sacrifices, no more pawns. No titans or gods will ever touch his friends, and hopefully things will be peaceful for some time.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u2014\u2014</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>In the end, Percy gets a month.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The nightmare starts like all the others do, with Percy on the banks of the River Cocytus, alone. That\u2019s why he doesn\u2019t notice that one of the mountains has a face on it until he hears\u2014</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cPercy Jackson.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Percy swears that he must\u2019ve jumped a foot in the air. He whips around, instinctively hopping towards the edge of the black water before he remembers where he is and who he\u2019s dealing with.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHey,\u201d Percy says, doing his best to sound nonchalant. Judging by the mountain\u2019s smirk, he\u2019s not doing a great job. \u201cI don\u2019t appreciate you talking about me behind my back.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cMy daughter acted of her own accord,\u201d the mountain says, before adding in a snooty voice, \u201cBut, I do not appreciate her being exploded. She is exceptionally whiny when reforming.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Percy definitely doesn\u2019t want to unpack that. So, instead he asks, \u201cHow\u2019s Polyphemus?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHe\u2019s a pathetic whelp.\u201d The mountain scowls, which is a really weird look for a mountain, by the way. \u201cYou must at least attempt to beat some discipline into the riff-raff before sending them my way. I had to assign him to the mango grove by the lava moat. He\u2019s no good for anything but picking his own food.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHuh,\u201d Percy says. \u201cLava mangos. Do I want to know how you got the seeds or\u2014\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou are not using the Golden Fleece to mend my son,\u201d the mountain interrupts.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>No more small talk then. Fine. Percy\u2019s not good at faking politeness anyway.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThe Fleece belongs to the children of the gods,\u201d he says.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWe made a deal,\u201d frowns the mountain. The river begins to boil, as the ground shudders.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAnd I\u2019m fulfilling it,\u201d Percy says quickly. \u201cI just thought you\u2019d appreciate a more personal touch. Don\u2019t you think your son would be happier with a shiny new body instead of one that\u2019s already been chopped into a thousand little pieces?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>A pause.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The earth stops shaking. The river lies back in its bed.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cKronos grows restless,\u201d the mountain sighs. \u201cHe is a stubborn child. I demand that you render him hale, hearty, and back at my side within a fortnight.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cUh,\u201d Percy\u2019s never associated Kronos with the word hearty before. Kronos probably couldn\u2019t grow a heart if he read all of Aphrodite\u2019s romance novels. \u201cAre you sure you\u2019re ready?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cReady?\u201d The bloody sky darkens as the mountain appears to tremble with indignation. \u201cOf course I\u2019m ready! I\u2019ve been getting Tartarus to clean up his act for months! I\u2019ve unchained my children, I\u2019ve set up chore schedules, I\u2019ve sewn get along shirts\u2014We even have mangos now! Mangos! Do you know how much work it takes to grow mangos, Percy Jackson?! Tartarus is a model household! Everyone here is very happy!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Wow. Okay.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>It seems like someone didn\u2019t listen to the suggestion box tip. Maybe Percy should start asking his mom for parenting advice. She is the best parent he knows, since she\u2019s the only really good parent he knows. Percy\u2019s not a great example of why, but that\u2019s not her fault. Everything wrong with him is entirely his own.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cFine,\u201d Percy says. \u201cI\u2019m the one who\u2019s not ready. The deal includes all my friends, remember? And I haven\u2019t even visited Camp Jupiter yet.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The mountain\u2019s expression is suddenly very, very neutral.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThe Romans are not your friends,\u201d she replies.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYes, they are,\u201d Percy says slowly.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Silence. Now the mountain won\u2019t meet his eyes.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWait,\u201d Percy says. \u201cDid you do something to the Romans?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>More silence.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Percy\u2019s mind starts racing. Frank shouldn\u2019t be at Camp Jupiter yet, and it can\u2019t be Hazel\u2014He doesn\u2019t think he\u2019s done anything that might affect them at this point either. Reyna might\u2019ve made it there already, but it\u2019s more likely that\u2014</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cDid you do something to Jason?\u201d Percy asks.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The mountain hesitates. \u201c...Perhaps if the blood of more demigods was offered to me, I would be strong enough to summon the Trojan Sea Monster back.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Fucking\u2014\u201cNo, okay?! You get my blood or no blood. We\u2019ve been over this! Wait, the Trojan Sea Monster?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>If mountains could stick their noses in the air, this mountain would be doing that right now. \u201cI have not broken our deal. Jason Grace will be fine. He defeated the Trojan Sea Monster in the other life.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cDid he do it when he was twelve?!\u201d Percy\u2019s going to throttle this entire mountain. He\u2019s going to figure out how to do it, and then he\u2019s going to do it hard.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The mountain falls silent. Then she says, \u201cThe Trojan Sea Monster is no longer within my control. You did not inform me that the Romans were your friends. This is your responsibility.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNo, it\u2019s n\u2014\u201d The landscape starts swirling away into darkness as the dream pulls away. \u201cWait!\u201d Percy yells. \u201cWe\u2019re not done yet! We\u2019re not done! Gaea!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u2014\u2014</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201c\u2014ou\u2019re really that bored, you don\u2019t have to stay.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Percy blinks a couple times, then lifts his head off Annabeth\u2019s shoulder. All of it\u2014the sunlight, her hair, the drafting paper spread across the dining table\u2014it\u2019s all a big bright blur. Percy wipes his eyes once, twice. His arms are trembling.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Annabeth pulls his hands away. \u201cPercy?\u201d she says.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>And Percy can only blame the post-dream confusion for what tumbles out of his mouth next.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cFuck,\u201d he says blearily. \u201cI need to go to San Francisco.\u201d</span>\n</p>"
