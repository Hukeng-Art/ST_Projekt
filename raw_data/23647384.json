I guess that could be a good thing, depending on how you look at it...</p>\n<p>I've just been blown away by all the support I've had on this fic! I literally can't stop writing it because I'm enjoying it so much - so I'm really glad that other people are enjoying it, too! </p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p> <strike>And I finally get to crack out my favourite \"Idiots In Love\" tag, excellent!</strike></p>\n<p>\n(See the end of the chapter for <a href=\"#chapter_5_endnotes\">notes</a>.)\n</p>\n<p>I want to say a massive thanks to everyone who's read, kudosed, bookmarked, and commented! The response has been wonderful, and I'm so grateful. I've enjoyed writing this fic so, so much (evidenced by the fact that I've churned out 40K words in like ten days, whoops), and I found it so difficult to end that I'm very tempted to write more...</p>",
  "text": "<p>\u201cHave you seen that witcher today?\u201d </p>\n<p>Jaskier stops dead in the middle of the street, hand flexing uncomfortably around the strap of his lute case. The marketplace of this out-of-the-way little town is busy enough that his eavesdropping isn\u2019t obvious, but at the same time he doesn\u2019t want to particularly be caught staring at the admittedly very buxom local woman whose gossip he\u2019s just overheard. There are more than enough big, burly men around here who could snap him in half without even thinking about it if he pisses them off, and ogling their wife, girlfriend, sister, daughter, mother, whoever is always a bad way to go. </p>\n<p>\u201cThe one who took the contract down by the Saliman farm?\u201d the buxom woman\u2019s friend asks, as Jaskier pretends to be interested in a display of beetroot. \u201cSaw him in the tavern yesterday evening. Barti tried to pick a fight with him, but the Saliman boy stopped it before it started, said he wanted to talk to him.\u201d She shrugs, running her fingers over a bolt of rough linen. \u201cThey left soon after.\u201d </p>\n<p>The buxom woman frowns. \u201cHe\u2019s not come back yet,\u201d she says, passing a couple of coins over to the stallholder and accepting a length of pale green ribbon in return \u2013 and all of a sudden, Jaskier\u2019s mouth is dry. </p>\n<p>Her friend snorts out a laugh. \u201cYou worrying about a <i>witcher</i>, Maria?\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cNot <i>worrying</i>,\u201d Maria answers defensively, tucking the ribbon away in the satchel slung over her shoulder. \u201cJust\u2026 wondering.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll have four yards of this,\u201d her friend says to the stallholder, then turns back to Maria, eyebrow raised. For some reason, there\u2019s a golden beetroot in Jaskier\u2019s hand and the greengrocer is staring at him suspiciously. He puts the beetroot back down, and moves on to the furrier next door. \u201cBe honest with me,\u201d Maria\u2019s friend is saying, a lick of humour creeping into her voice. \u201cYou just want him to come back so you can shove your tits in his face again.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201c<i>Jessa</i>,\u201d Maria hisses. </p>\n<p>Jessa snorts. \u201cCome on, Maria, I saw the way you were looking at him,\u201d she teases. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t blame you. If I didn\u2019t have Barti, well, I\u2019d be doing the same thing. Those <i>muscles</i>, those <i>thighs</i>.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s the eyes,\u201d Maria sighs. \u201cThose golden eyes, oh, Jessa, the things I want those eyes to watch me do\u2026\u201d </p>\n<p>Jessa laughs, and pays for her purchased linen. \u201cMores the pity,\u201d she says, \u201cgiven that he\u2019s probably not coming back.\u201d </p>\n<p>Jaskier\u2019s fingers freeze, fingertips caressing a mink that\u2019s probably worth more than his entire outfit \u2013 and this is one of his better ones, too. The furrier is watching him out of the corner of one eye, but he\u2019s not yet as suspicious as the greengrocer so Jaskier keeps up the pretence. </p>\n<p>Maria\u2019s frowning. \u201cIs that what you think?\u201d </p>\n<p>Jessa shrugs. \u201cI think that if he\u2019d come back, we\u2019d know,\u201d she says. \u201cBarti would have tried to slit his throat, or something equally idiotic. Given that my idiot husband <i>isn\u2019t</i> currently on his arse in a pile of horseshit, the witcher hasn\u2019t come back. And if he\u2019s not back by now, he\u2019s probably not coming back.\u201d Jaskier\u2019s heart thuds so loud in his chest for a second that he struggles to catch his breath. \u201cHe\u2019ll be dead in a ditch somewhere \u2013 that\u2019s how witchers usually end their lives, isn\u2019t it? It\u2019s a waste of a good pair of delightfully thick thighs, but it\u2019s to be expected.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201c<i>Bard</i>.\u201d </p>\n<p>Jaskier jumps, his fingers spasming tight around the mink. </p>\n<p>The furrier is looking at him, one eyebrow raised. \u201cYou buying that?\u201d he asks, sounding distinctly unimpressed. </p>\n<p>\u201cAh, no,\u201d Jaskier says, carefully detaching himself from the ridiculously expensive fur. He pats it delicately, smoothes it out, flashes the furrier as much of a smile as he can manage \u2013 but by the time he turns back to the market, the two women are nowhere to be seen. \u201c<i>Shit</i>,\u201d he spits, because sure, okay, he knows there are other witchers in the world, knows that it\u2019s not necessarily Geralt, knows that, well, Geralt probably wouldn\u2019t want to see him even if it was him \u2013 but at the same time, what if he walks away and Geralt of fucking Rivia is <i>actually</i> dying in a ditch in this poxy backwater? \u201cShit,\u201d Jaskier swears again, hoists his lute higher on his shoulder, and goes to find out where exactly the Saliman farm is. </p>\n<p>He only has to ask a handful of townspeople before a gruff farmhand points him in the right direction, not without a growled warning about generic monsters and mayhem. Jaskier just nods and smiles, trying to distance himself from this conversation as quickly as he can, then sets off at a brisk walk down the track that leads out to the farm. A brisk walk which becomes a slow jog as the track starts to wind through scraggy woodland, which rapidly turns into a flat-out run when he rounds a final bend in the track and sees what can only be described as pure carnage laid out in front of him. </p>\n<p>\u201cShit, fuck, <i>bollocks</i>,\u201d Jaskier mutters frantically under his breath, boots slipping on the muddy cart-track, because the building that he\u2019s guessing was once the Saliman farm is in utter ruins, crushed and destroyed beneath the razor claws and lashing wings of two huge wyverns. He can see the beasts\u2019 corpses draped over the ruins of the farmhouse, see their blood splattered across the bricks and mortar \u2013 and there, in front of the destroyed building, head and shoulders hidden by the sharp, venomous end of one of the wyvern\u2019s tails, is a body. </p>\n<p>For a second, Jaskier thinks he might vomit. </p>\n<p>He runs as fast as he can towards the devastation, lute case bumping painfully against his back, and all he can imagine is Geralt\u2019s face, slack in death, golden eyes half-lidded, silver-white hair stained with blood and dirt. It hurts worse than any words spoken in anger on the top of a mountain, and there are tears pricking his foolish eyes already, stinging at the back of his throat, spurring him onwards so faster that he almost runs straight into the horse that he hadn\u2019t even fucking <i>noticed</i>, the horse that\u2019s nosing around the bloody grass a few metres away from the witcher\u2019s body.</p>\n<p>The horse that <i>isn\u2019t Roach</i>. </p>\n<p>Jaskier comes skidding to a halt, heels slipping in the gravel, and goes to his knees next to the witcher who isn\u2019t Geralt. \u201cThank fuck,\u201d he mutters, shrugging his pack and his lute to the ground, then leans forward over the sluggishly-oozing rent in the witcher\u2019s stomach. \u201cWell, that\u2019s not good, is it?\u201d he says, heart still racing, then looks up at the witcher\u2019s face, dark hair, thick scars running down one cheek. \u201cSo you don\u2019t all have weird white hair,\u201d he says, falsely cheery, then reaches up, feels for a pulse. It\u2019s weak but it\u2019s there, and he sighs, turns his attention back to the gaping wound. \u201cTook on a bit too much there, didn\u2019t you?\u201d he asks, peeling back the layers of the witcher\u2019s clothes to expose his wound a little more. \u201cOh, that\u2019s <i>nasty</i>,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s from that lovely beastie\u2019s tail, isn\u2019t it? I remember Geralt getting hit by one a few years ago, took him a couple of days to recover. Lucky for you I was in the area!\u201d The witcher, understandably, doesn\u2019t respond. Blood loss, poison, exhaustion \u2013 he\u2019s pretty solidly unconscious. \u201cRight,\u201d Jaskier says brightly. \u201cWhere are your potions, my friend? Ah, I\u2019m guessing you\u2019re like Geralt and you keep everything with your horse.\u201d </p>\n<p>The witcher doesn\u2019t answer, but Jaskier goes to fetch the horse anyway.</p>\n<p>He brings the grey gelding closer, lashes its reins to the splintered remains of a tree, then starts searching through its saddlebags. \u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re more willing to play with strangers than Roach is,\u201d he says to the gelding, running a soft touch down its nose. \u201cShe would have bitten my hand off by now. Ah hah!\u201d He pulls out a secure leather pouch that clanks with the soft noise of vials bumping against one another, then goes back to the witcher\u2019s side, retrieves his own waterskin and rummages around in the leather pouch. \u201cRight,\u201d he says, talking to the unconscious witcher and the grey gelding as much as to himself. \u201cIt\u2019s a wyvern, so you\u2019ve been poisoned. I wrote a song about a wyvern once, <i>The Lay of the Dragon\u2019s Tail</i> \u2013 well, I made it into a dragon, sounds more intimidating to lay folk. And poison means you need\u2026 this one!\u201d He shuffles up to the witcher\u2019s head, tilts his head back, opens his mouth with his thumb and drips the potion slowly between his lips. \u201cCome on, I\u2019m going to need you to drink it,\u201d he says softly, running a comforting hand through the witcher\u2019s hair \u2013 and, much to his delight, the witcher\u2019s throat slowly bobs as instinct makes him swallow. </p>\n<p>\u201c<i>Brilliant!</i>\u201d Jaskier says. \u201cWe might make it through this after all, my dear witcher. Right, this wound.\u201d He winces, grabs his waterskin. \u201cThis is going to hurt,\u201d he says apologetically. \u201cJust\u2026 stay unconscious, yeah?\u201d He pours the water over the wound, flooding out as much of the blood and dirt as he can, then goes back into the witcher\u2019s leather pouch. He finds a potion he recognises as an antiseptic, uncorks it, grimaces up at the witcher, says, \u201cSorry\u201d, and pours the foaming liquid over the gash in his stomach. </p>\n<p>The witcher jolts upright with a cry, eyes as golden-bright as Geralt\u2019s. He casts around himself wildly, hands scrabbling at the dirt, clearly maddened by the pain, and then he catches sight of Jaskier, frozen at his side. His pupils narrow into slits in an instant and he grabs Jaskier\u2019s wrist with all his witcher strength, spits, \u201cWho\u2014\u201d, but then clearly the pain gets too much and he slumps back down to the ground, breathing hard. </p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d Jaskier says, as calmly as the pain in his wrist allows, valiantly\u2014and pointlessly, of course\u2014trying to pry those fingers off himself. \u201cI\u2019m a friend, you can trust me. You\u2019re badly hurt, and I\u2019m going to need my hand back so I can help you, okay?\u201d </p>\n<p>The witcher\u2019s eyes are fixed on him, forehead furrowed, teeth bared \u2013 and then Jaskier sees his nostrils flare, sees him scent the air. Confusion flickers across the witcher\u2019s expression, but before Jaskier can give too much thought to it, his eyes roll back in his head and he passes out again. </p>\n<p>\u201cOne way to solve <i>that</i> problem,\u201d Jaskier mutters, slipping his wrist free of the witcher\u2019s fingers. He eyes the wound, still foaming with antiseptic, then says, \u201cRight. Where\u2019s your needle and thread? I\u2019ll have to sew this up.\u201d At predictable lack of an answer, Jaskier gets to his feet, goes to rummage in the witcher\u2019s saddlebags again until he unearths a small medical kit: needles, thread, bandages, all the basics. \u201cExcellent,\u201d he says, settling himself back down on the ground, then eyes the witcher\u2019s slack face again. \u201cI\u2019m going to ask very politely that you don\u2019t wake up in the middle of this and break my neck.\u201d He waits for a beat, then shrugs into the silence. \u201cAlright then, I\u2019ll take that as a promise, my friend.\u201d </p>\n<p>It takes him half an hour or so to sew up the wound, thanking whatever gods might be listening under his breath every time he knots off a stitch without getting a witcher\u2019s fist to the side of his head. He washes his hands when he\u2019s done, then rinses as much blood and gore off the closed wound as he can. He\u2019s got a pot of healing salve in his own pack that he fishes out and smears across the ragged edges, then retrieves the witcher\u2019s bandages and pauses for a second, looking between the clean fabric and the wound. \u201cI\u2019d love to wrap this around you,\u201d he says slowly, \u201cbut you\u2019re looking pretty heavy, my friend, and I\u2019m not really strong enough to manhandle you.\u201d He puts the bandages back. \u201cWe\u2019ll try that when you\u2019re conscious, yeah?\u201d He waits for an answer he knows isn\u2019t coming, then nods sagely. \u201cGlad you agree. I think we\u2019re going to get along just fine.\u201d</p>\n<p>The witcher just lies there, breathing slow, heartbeat even slower. </p>\n<p>It was already midafternoon when Jaskier left town to go witcher-hunting, and the sun is rapidly sliding down the horizon. The wyvern carcasses are also starting to smell distinctly unpleasant, so Jaskier figures he should probably try to find them some shelter a little further away. Once he\u2019s fairly confident the strange witcher isn\u2019t going to die the moment he turns his back, he manages to find a small outhouse that\u2019s not completely destroyed \u2013 it\u2019s sheltered from the elements, with most of its roof left and even a couple of bales of hay for the witcher\u2019s horse. \u201cPerfect,\u201d he says to himself, and deposits his lute case and pack by the entrance. \u201cNow I just need to get him all the way from over there\u2026 to in here\u2026\u201d Jaskier props his hands on his hips and clicks his tongue against his teeth. \u201cThis could prove problematic.\u201d </p>\n<p>In the end, it\u2019s actually not so bad. He obviously can\u2019t actually move the witcher by himself, because, much like Geralt, the man is pretty much wholly dense muscle and therefore weighs an absolute tonne. Jaskier, though, was never daunted by a challenge, and before long he rigs up a passable litter with a couple of straight-ish branches and a blanket out of the witcher\u2019s saddlebags. He manoeuvres the witcher onto the litter with only a moderate amount of heaving and cursing, then lashes the litter to the gelding\u2019s saddle and slowly\u00ac\u2014<i>very slowly</i>\u2014walks the horse over towards the outhouse. </p>\n<p>The witcher twitches and even groans a couple of times as the makeshift litter bumps over the uneven ground, but the wound stays closed and he doesn\u2019t wake, so Jaskier isn\u2019t too worried. He manages to get him into the little outhouse before it\u2019s fully dark, then he plumps a couple of handfuls of hay down in front of the gelding and goes back out to the destroyed farmhouse with the last of the light. He\u2019s pretty sure he\u2019s got most of the witcher\u2019s possessions tucked carefully away, his saddlebags, his potions, but the two items that are conspicuous in their absence are his swords.</p>\n<p>Jaskier knows how important Geralt\u2019s swords are, and he\u2019d wager a guess that this strange wounded witcher is much the same. </p>\n<p>He finds the steel sword fairly quickly, bloody and half-hidden under the wyvern\u2019s tail that\u2019s still red and flaking with the witcher\u2019s blood. He takes that back to the outhouse, carrying it with both hands\u2014\u201cGods,\u201d he mutters, \u201cno wonder these bloody witchers are <i>heavy</i>.\u201d\u2014and then, after a moment\u2019s pause, ventures into the ruins of the farmhouse itself. </p>\n<p>Looking up at the corpse of a twenty-metre wyvern, eye still half-open in death, the sun setting behind its horned head and shadows stretching long and dark beneath its body, Jaskier feels a thrill of fear flood through his gut. \u201cThe things I do for witchers,\u201d he says, trying to force himself to be cheerful, then plunges into the fray. The silver sword takes a little while to find, stabbed through the roof of the wyvern\u2019s mouth and into its brain, and even longer to retrieve \u2013 turns out that those witcher muscles are <i>also</i> useful for pulling blades out of monster skulls. Jaskier gets it out in the end, though, by which time he\u2019s covered in sweat and wyvern gore, and returns to the outhouse just as the sun\u2019s last rays disappear beneath the horizon. </p>\n<p>\u201cGreat,\u201d he says to himself, depositing the filthy silver sword next to its twin. \u201cNow I have to start a fire in the dark.\u201d </p>\n<p>The witcher, the ungrateful bastard, doesn\u2019t say anything. </p>\n<p>It\u2019s pitch black outside by the time that Jaskier manages to get a fire going, delicate little flames licking up around the sweet-smelling hay that he\u2019s having to use for kindling. He blows them carefully until they catch fully, then adds a couple of twigs and finally a chunk of the tree he tied the witcher\u2019s gelding to earlier. The fire is crackling along merrily before long, and Jaskier goes to check on his patient. </p>\n<p>The witcher seems to have settled into a genuine doze, now, instead of unconsciousness induced by blood loss and shock, which is a good sign. The wound in his stomach is already showing signs of closing, thanks to that wonderful witcher healing, and Jaskier lets out a soft sigh. \u201cLooks like you\u2019ll be staying with me in the land of living a little while longer,\u201d he says, and pats the witcher\u2019s shoulder companionably. He pauses for a second, squints, then leans closer \u2013 because the witcher\u2019s medallion must have slipped out of his shirt while he was being dragged behind his horse like a sack of potatoes, and now it lies flat and shining against his bloody clothes, glinting in the firelight. </p>\n<p>It\u2019s an exact replica of Geralt\u2019s.</p>\n<p>\u201cStands to reason,\u201d Jaskier mutters, returning to his own seat on the other side of the fire. \u201cThe eyes are the same, too. I bet you know him, don\u2019t you? I bet you\u2019re just\u2026 best friends.\u201d His voice breaks, just a little, so he does what he always does and hides his emotions behind bustle and activity, pulling a couple of strips of jerky out of his pack, settling down next to the merrily crackling fire and laying his lute across his lap. He eats quickly, quietly, keeping up a running commentary on the taste of the jerky, the smell of the merchant he bought it from, the discomfort of the uneven ground under him, the warmth of the fire on his face \u2013 and it\u2019s weird, he\u2019s finding, because he never feels the need to talk his backside off like this when he\u2019s by himself, and he\u2019s basically by himself right now. Except he\u2019s not, obviously, because there\u2019s a hulking, over-muscled witcher sleeping like the dead on the other side of his fire.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s not like, in his experience, witchers actually give a shit about his conversation, anyway.</p>\n<p>Jaskier tucks the remainder of the jerky away, then strums the strings of his lute and hums softly under his breath. </p>\n<p>He\u2019s in an isolated outhouse, sitting by a fire that\u2019s probably going to attract all the murderers and predators in the surrounding area, next to a destroyed farmhouse that\u2019s draped in the rotting corpses of two wyverns. There\u2019s a catatonic, injured witcher that he\u2019s never met before in his care, breaths soft and heavy in the cooling night air, and all he has to protect himself is a pair of witcher swords that he can\u2019t lift, a small dagger in his boot, and his lute. </p>\n<p>Jaskier lets out a breath, and keeps playing. </p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t sleep that night, and, surprisingly enough, he doesn\u2019t really get tired. It\u2019s probably the adrenaline, probably the fear, but he spends the dark hours feeding the fire, singing under his breath, plucking chords from his lute. He doesn\u2019t sing anything in particular for a while, just experiments with discordances and awkward harmonies, looking for something that he can\u2019t quite put his finger on, but then he slips into older melodies, easier melodies, stories of heroics and heartbreak, tales of epic deeds and star-crossed lovers. </p>\n<p>The songs hurt, of course, but he\u2019s learning to cope with it. </p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re Geralt\u2019s bard.\u201d </p>\n<p>Jaskier nearly jumps out of his skin. </p>\n<p>The witcher is awake and watching him, yellow-gold eyes sharply intent, and Jaskier husks, \u201cFuck! You scared me.\u201d He puts his lute to one side, gaze going to the wound in the witcher\u2019s stomach, then says, \u201cTry not to move too much, yeah? That wound\u2019s healing, but it was pretty bad.\u201d He gets to his feet, moves around the fire, then pushes witcher flat and studies the gash in his stomach. \u201cGotta love those witcher mutations,\u201d he mutters, seeing that the horrific injury is already starting to knit itself closed, then sits back on his heels, meets the witcher\u2019s gaze, offers him a smile. \u201cMy name\u2019s Jaskier,\u201d he says, going back to his side of the fire. \u201cAnd you are?\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cEskel,\u201d the witcher says, then narrows his eyes. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d </p>\n<p>Jaskier barks a laugh. \u201cYou\u2019re the one with the hole in your gut \u2013 you tell me!\u201d </p>\n<p>Eskel frowns, looking down at himself. \u201cThere were two wyverns,\u201d he says, plucking at the ruined fabric across his stomach. \u201cTricky, but not impossible \u2013 and the Saliman fella agreed to pay double, so I figured, hey, why not? The first one wasn\u2019t so bad, but then my silver sword got stuck in that motherfucker\u2019s skull and the second was\u2026 tough. It\u2019s a bit hazy towards the end, but I think the bastard got a stray hit in just as I took it down. I must\u2019ve passed out.\u201d He slumps back down to the hard ground, wincing. \u201cFucking <i>hell</i>, that hurts.\u201d He glances over at Jaskier, the scars on his face winking in the firelight. \u201cAnd how exactly did <i>you</i> get involved?\u201d </p>\n<p>Jaskier\u2019s a little dumbstruck, mainly because this witcher is\u2026 well, <i>chatty</i>. \u201cOverheard some of the people in the town talking about a witcher who\u2019d gone hunting and hadn\u2019t come back,\u201d he says, mouth oddly dry. \u201cI thought I\u2019d come check it out. Found you, you know, dying.\u201d </p>\n<p>Eskel frowns at him. \u201cYou just came trotting after a strange witcher?\u201d he asks, voice scratchy. \u201cNot knowing anything about the contract, or even about who it was you were tracking?\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cAre you really complaining?\u201d Jaskier asks, raising an eyebrow. \u201cPretty sure I saved your life.\u201d </p>\n<p>Eskel grunts, fingers hovering hesitantly over his gut. \u201cYeah, pretty sure you did,\u201d he says, and the gratitude in his voice isn\u2019t grudging, isn\u2019t hesitant, isn\u2019t awkward. \u201cThanks for that, Jaskier. I appreciate it.\u201d </p>\n<p>Jaskier blinks, momentarily lost for words. </p>\n<p>Eskel stares at him. \u201cYou look like I just spat in your face.\u201d </p>\n<p>Jaskier barks a laugh. \u201cNo, it\u2019s just\u2026\u201d He trails off, shakes his head. \u201cI\u2019m used to witchers being all grumpy and monosyllabic. And having to drag thanks out of them with a pair of pliers.\u201d </p>\n<p>Eskel laughs. \u201cThat\u2019s what you get for spending time with Geralt,\u201d he says. \u201cHe might be very good at killing monsters, but he\u2019s not exactly the continent\u2019s greatest conversationalist.\u201d He shifts a little, glances down at himself again. \u201cI\u2019m assuming that I\u2019ve got Geralt to thank for the fact that you\u2019ve patched me up pretty damn neatly?\u201d</p>\n<p>Jaskier snorts. \u201cI like to think that you\u2019ve got me to thank for that,\u201d he says haughtily, \u201cbut if you\u2019re asking if it\u2019s because of Geralt that I know what all your potions are, if it\u2019s because of him that I know how to treat a wyvern\u2019s venom, if it\u2019s because of him that I\u2019m a surprisingly dab hand at sewing up gaping holes in witchers\u2019 stomachs?\u201d He deflates a little. \u201cThen yeah, you\u2019d be right.\u201d </p>\n<p>Eskel\u2019s just watching him, firelight casting deep shadows across his pale face.</p>\n<p>Jaskier grabs his pack, finds the remainder of the jerky, passes it over the fire. \u201cYou should eat,\u201d he says. \u201cI know you\u2019re a witcher and all that, but you need to keep up your strength.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cThanks,\u201d Eskel says, and takes a bite. He chews for a second, eyeing Jaskier critically, then says, \u201cWant to tell me why you smell like you want to vomit whenever you say my brother\u2019s name?\u201d </p>\n<p>Jaskier\u2019s heart seizes in his chest. \u201cWhat?\u201d </p>\n<p>Eskel snorts and chews another mouthful. \u201cYou know I can hear that your heart just sped up, right?\u201d </p>\n<p>Jaskier feels his cheeks flushing, and he grabs his lute, hauls it into his lap like a barrier. \u201cI think I prefer Geralt\u2019s monosyllabism.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cNo, you don\u2019t,\u201d Eskel says, tearing another strip of jerky off with his teeth. He studies Jaskier for a moment, the look in those golden eyes as familiar as it is astonishingly alien. \u201cHe talks about you, you know,\u201d he says eventually. </p>\n<p>Jaskier\u2019s head flies up. \u201cGeralt does?\u201d </p>\n<p>Eskel nods, swallowing. \u201cI usually only see him during the winters,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd don\u2019t get me wrong, bard, it\u2019s not like he\u2019s singing your praises from the rafters.\u201d Jaskier laughs shortly at the mental image, plucks a soft chord from the strings of his lute. \u201cBut he\u2019s mentioned you, your songs, your company. He seems to appreciate it.\u201d </p>\n<p>Jaskier can\u2019t hold back a disbelieving snort. \u201cSure,\u201d he mutters under his breath. </p>\n<p>Eskel\u2019s eyes narrow. \u201cWhat did he do?\u201d </p>\n<p>Jaskier\u2019s lips are tight. \u201cWhat makes you think that he did something?\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cBecause I\u2019ve known that man longer than you\u2019ve been alive,\u201d Eskel says flatly. \u201cI know he gives a shit about you. But I also know he has a bad habit of being an emotionally-stunted fuckwit when he wants to be.\u201d </p>\n<p>Jaskier gives Eskel an appraising look, his fingers plucking idly at his lute. \u201cDid I just manage to adopt the one witcher who doesn\u2019t understand how to interact with actual people?\u201d he asks, incredulous. \u201cIsn\u2019t that just my luck.\u201d </p>\n<p>Eskel laughs, then winces, his hand flexing into a fist over his stomach. \u201c<i>Ow</i>,\u201d he says. \u201cFucking wyverns.\u201d </p>\n<p>Jaskier retrieves the blanket from his own pack and gets to his feet. \u201cSleep,\u201d he says. \u201cGather your strength. You might be a magic witcher, but you\u2019ve still got a damn hole in your stomach.\u201d He can see the tiredness in the droop of Eskel\u2019s eyelids, and he shakes the blanket out over him, tucks him in like a mother tucking in her child. </p>\n<p>\u201cYou gonna heat up a bottle of milk for me, too?\u201d Eskel asks. \u201cMaybe brush my hair?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat costs extra,\u201d Jaskier says, and pats Eskel\u2019s hair firmly. \u201cGo to sleep, witcher.\u201d </p>\n<p>Eskel closes his eyes, settles back into the hard ground. \u201cThanks, bard,\u201d he says, and is asleep in moments. </p>\n<p>Jaskier sits with his lute for a long moment, fingertips sliding up and down the strings, listening to the haunting whirr that movement makes. He knows he\u2019s staring at the sleeping witcher, knows that should probably give the injured man whatever modicum of privacy he can, but at the same time there\u2019s a dryness in his throat and a tightness in his stomach that he can\u2019t quite place. </p>\n<p>That\u2019s a lie, of course. He knows <i>exactly</i> where that discomfort comes from, knows <i>exactly</i> when that discomfort started, but he\u2019s not about to tell that to some fucking stranger. Well, actually he\u2019ll sing it to any stranger in a tavern who cares to listen \u2013 but this witcher, he\u2019s not a stranger, not really. He\u2019s Geralt\u2019s fucking <i>brother</i>. </p>\n<p>\u201cShit,\u201d Jaskier mutters under his breath, and bows his head over his lute. </p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The sun rises over the wyvern\u2019s carcasses with its usual regularity, but Eskel doesn\u2019t wake. Jaskier stays in the little outhouse for a while, then makes the mistake of getting a whiff of himself\u2014sweaty, dirty, still covered in wyvern gore\u2014and vomits a little in his mouth. He leaves Eskel to recuperate while he goes to find whatever water source serves the farm, finds a miraculously untouched well round the back and even a couple of buckets nearby, then draws up enough water to wash off the worst of the muck and even give his doublet and undershirt a rough rinse. He hangs them up next to the front of the outhouse to dry, then goes to fetch another few buckets back for whenever Eskel decides to rejoin the land of the living.</p>\n<p>Which, as it turns out, is when he gets back, shirtless and lugging two buckets of water like a farmhand. </p>\n<p>Eskel eyes him critically, one eyebrow raised. \u201cExcellent service in this inn of yours, Master Bard,\u201d he says, lips quirked in a grin. He\u2019s managed to manoeuvre himself upright, and he\u2019s sitting with his back propped up against the wall of the outhouse, his swords across his thighs, cleaning wyvern innards of the blades with practiced motions. </p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m expecting good tipping,\u201d Jaskier says, dumping the buckets down next to Eskel\u2019s horse. He gestures at the weapons in Eskel\u2019s lap. \u201cSorry for not cleaning them up a bit. Geralt once threw me in a river for trying to help him with them, so I figured the bond between a witcher and his swords was probably not one worth fiddling with.\u201d</p>\n<p>Eskel looks amused. \u201cHe threw you in a river?\u201d he asks. \u201cFor trying to help with his swords?\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cIt was a small river,\u201d Jaskier says defensively, reaching for his now-dry undershirt. \u201cAnd, well, it was maybe a bit more complicated than that. I was asking about his swords, and he told me that he didn\u2019t trust me with them as far as he could throw me, which, you know, <i>rude</i>, and he might have been joking but I wasn\u2019t about to let it slide \u2013 so I might have flicked some of the oil I use on my lute in his face.\u201d </p>\n<p>Eskel nods, understanding. \u201cSo he threw you in the river,\u201d he says, tone light and laughing. \u201cGot to say, Jaskier, it sort of sounds like you brought it on yourself.\u201d </p>\n<p>Jaskier\u2019s smile freezes a little. \u201cYes, well,\u201d he says. \u201cI am very good at shovelling shit.\u201d </p>\n<p>Eskel gives him an odd look, thoughtful and keen, but Jaskier just bustles through the moment and ignores him. \u201cHow\u2019s the stomach?\u201d he asks, crouching down and moving Eskel\u2019s absurdly muscled body around so he can get a better look. </p>\n<p>\u201cAlready pretty closed up,\u201d Eskel answers. \u201cI downed another dose of the healing potion while you were gone, should be good to go by tomorrow.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jaskier shakes his head. \u201cYou witchers,\u201d he says. \u201cAnyone else would be dead. You? Two days and you just shake it right off.\u201d </p>\n<p>Eskel shrugs, smile playing around his lips. \u201cThat\u2019s what the horrifically painful mutagens and Trials are for!\u201d he says, <i>way</i> too bright and cheery. \u201cTwo wyverns and a gaping stomach wound is small fry, easily dealt with.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cAs long as you have a passing bard to patch you up,\u201d Jaskier points out.</p>\n<p>\u201cWith some very tidy stitches, too,\u201d Eskel says. \u201cNot just good with a lute.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cI have many talents,\u201d Jaskier says, beaming a smile. His doublet is still a little damp so he leaves it for now, just sits down on the ground a few feet away and watches Eskel oil his swords. \u201cYou reckon you\u2019ll be able to head back to town today? Might be better for your recovery to sleep in a bed rather than in an outhouse.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, should be able to,\u201d Eskel says. \u201cSee if I can collect payment for the job that nearly killed me, or if that Saliman bastard tries to wriggle out of it. He seemed like a wriggler, not gonna lie.\u201d He glances up at Jaskier, frowning. \u201cOr you could just sing that song of yours, couldn\u2019t you? Geralt always said it\u2019s surprisingly effective.\u201d </p>\n<p>Jaskier preens, just a little. \u201cWhat can I say? I know how to charm the hearts of the masses.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cYou know how to write a fucking catchy tune is what you know how to do,\u201d Eskel says bluntly. \u201cFirst time I heard that damn song, I had it stuck in my head for a week.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t really see how that\u2019s my problem.\u201d</p>\n<p>Eskel laughs. \u201cI see why Geralt likes you,\u201d he says wryly, and it\u2019s probably a good thing that all his attention is focused on his swords at that moment because Jaskier can\u2019t stop the flash of hurt that dances across his expression. \u201cYou got business in the town?\u201d </p>\n<p>Jaskier pastes on a smile. \u201cNothing particular,\u201d he says. \u201cJust making my way to Oxenfurt \u2013 I was planning to spend the winter there. Seeing the continent a little on the way, you know how it is.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cThat I do,\u201d Eskel answers, sliding his swords back in their scabbards. \u201cHard beds, shitty food, and people who scowl at you whenever you enter a room. What better way to live your life?\u201d </p>\n<p>Jaskier shrugs. \u201cSwap your swords for a lute,\u201d he says. \u201cYou\u2019ll get glared at less.\u201d </p>\n<p>Eskel snorts. \u201cGeralt\u2019s told me enough about your\u2026 <i>escapades</i>,\u201d he says, \u201cto know that you don\u2019t exactly live the quiet life, bard. What\u2019s the long-standing one, the love of your life \u2013 the Countess de Cael?\u201d </p>\n<p>Jaskier\u2019s cheeks flush, and he\u2019s not sure whether it\u2019s because apparently Geralt has been talking about his conquests with his witcher brothers or whether it\u2019s because of the grossly-inaccurate phrase <i>love of your life</i>. \u201cDe Stael,\u201d he corrects. \u201cAnd I\u2019m not sure that\u2019s exactly how I\u2019d describe her. And, I\u2019d like to point out, none of <i>that</i> kind of trouble is because I\u2019m a bard!\u201d</p>\n<p>Eskel cocks a mocking eyebrow. \u201cWhy is it, then?\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cBecause I am a man who enjoys fine company,\u201d Jaskier says, aiming for lofty, \u201cwho is perpetually misunderstood by those around him.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cYou enjoy fine company,\u201d Eskel muses, \u201cyet choose to spend your days with Geralt of bloody Rivia, the least <i>fine</i> man on the continent. That\u2019s an interesting life choice, bard.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cGeralt\u2019s fine in his own way,\u201d Jaskier says almost on instinct, words leaving his lips even as a sharp pang floods through his heart. \u201cAnd anyway, it\u2019s not like I\u2019m with him right now, am I? Are you going to criticise your own company now, witcher? Not that you\u2019ve <i>been</i> much company, admittedly \u2013 mostly either unconscious or asleep, while I slave away to see to your every need.\u201d </p>\n<p>Eskel snorts and holds up his hands. \u201cTruce, Jaskier,\u201d he says, full of amusement. \u201cI\u2019m just a humble witcher. I don\u2019t stand a chance against a wordsmith of your\u2026 talents.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jaskier\u2019s pretty sure there\u2019s an insult in there somewhere, but he\u2019s going to take it anyway. \u201cIt\u2019s good to meet a witcher who knows when he\u2019s beaten,\u201d he says primly, not quite able to resist on final jibe. </p>\n<p>Eskel just laughs, and shakes his head. </p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jaskier doesn\u2019t know why he\u2019s still so surprised at how quickly witchers heal, because only a little over a day after he crashed to his knees next to his nearly-dead body, Eskel\u2019s up and about, only a little slowed down by the fact that yesterday there was a gaping gash in his body. His first priority is going to the wyverns to take their teeth as proof of the kill\u2014Jaskier stands back from <i>that</i> particular task, unwilling to get himself drenched in wyvern gore <i>yet again</i>\u2014and after that he busies himself with loading up his grey gelding, fingers deft and quick on the buckles of the saddle. </p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s his name?\u201d Jaskier asks as Eskel eyes the stirrups, clearly assessing whether or not it\u2019s a good idea to try to mount. </p>\n<p>\u201cLlwyd,\u201d Eskel answers, the word faintly musical on his tongue, then slots his foot into the stirrup and hoists himself onto the horse\u2019s back. His face is twisted in pain as he does so, and for a moment after he seats himself he just sits there, bent forward, catching his breath. \u201cHis name is Llwyd,\u201d he repeats finally, straightening up, and Jaskier is relieved to see that there\u2019s no blood seeping through the bandages they finally managed to wrap around his stomach. </p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s just Elder for \u2018grey\u2019,\u201d he points out, slinging his lute across his back and hoisting his pack onto his shoulder. \u201cNot exactly original.\u201d</p>\n<p>Eskel snorts a laugh, then winces, his hand pressed to his side. \u201cThe name came with the horse,\u201d he says wryly. \u201cSome backwoods seller who clearly thought that Elder names would jack up his prices.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cDid it work?\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cNot on me,\u201d Eskel says, and glances down to him. \u201cWell, come on then.\u201d </p>\n<p>Jaskier blinks. \u201cYou lead on,\u201d he says, gesturing broadly to the rutted track that will eventually lead them back to the town. \u201cYou\u2019re the wounded one, you should probably set the pace.\u201d </p>\n<p>Eskel stares at him for a long moment. \u201cJaskier, get up here,\u201d he says slowly, like he\u2019s talking to a child. \u201cLlwyd can take both our weight, and I know you didn\u2019t sleep last night \u2013 you must be exhausted. Ride with me.\u201d </p>\n<p>Jaskier stares up at him. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t I meet <i>you</i> in fucking Posada when I was eighteen and looking for inspiration?\u201d he asks, high-pitched and a little shrill. </p>\n<p>\u201cBecause I wouldn\u2019t be seen dead in fucking <i>Posada</i>,\u201d Eskel answers, and pats Llwyd\u2019s flank. \u201cUp you get, bard. I\u2019d offer you a hand, but I think that might make me fall off right now.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cWe wouldn\u2019t want that,\u201d Jaskier says, scrambling up onto Llwyd\u2019s back behind Eskel. \u201cThen I\u2019d just have to steal your horse and ride off into the sunset with all your belongings \u2013 what a <i>shame</i>.\u201d </p>\n<p>Eskel snorts, then twitches the reins and directs Llwyd into a slow walk. \u201cIf you were going to rob me, I reckon you would have done it already,\u201d he says, amused. \u201cYou know, when I was unconscious and bleeding to death yesterday? Instead of pouring healing potions down my throat and getting me into shelter for the night. You even retrieved my damn swords for me.\u201d </p>\n<p>Jaskier shrugs, then feels as the horse trots over a pothole, feels Eskel sway in the saddle more than he should do, hears the catch in his breath. He steadies him carefully, hands on his sides, then says, \u201cIs it explicitly trained into all you witchers to ignore your serious injuries and just pretend you\u2019re fine when you\u2019re obviously not?\u201d </p>\n<p>Eskel laughs. \u201cPretty much,\u201d he says, then presses his hand over Jaskier\u2019s. \u201cYou do realise that you\u2019re pretty rare in wanting to help us, right? Most people would be <i>much</i> more likely to rob me and leave me to bleed to death.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPeople are arseholes.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re not wrong,\u201d Eskel says, and spurs Llwyd onwards. </p>\n<p>It only takes them a few hours to get back to the town. Eskel perversely seems to gain strength the closer they get, and Jaskier barely has to steady him at all by the time they trot through the marketplace. They get a few strange looks but nothing that Jaskier isn\u2019t used to, and by the relaxed slant to Eskel\u2019s shoulders it seems that he\u2019s not exactly worried, either. Eskel directs Llwyd straight to the local inn, then they dismount as carefully as they can, Jaskier holding the reins as Eskel climbs down. \u201cYou good?\u201d he asks, gently stroking the horse\u2019s mane. </p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019m good,\u201d Eskel answers, barely any tightness in his voice. He flashes Jaskier a brilliant smile, bright and beaming. \u201cThis is where we part ways, bard,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m going to get a room, a bath, and probably sleep until the morning \u2013 and then I\u2019ll be off before first light.\u201d </p>\n<p>Jaskier nods. \u201cI\u2019ll find a tavern,\u201d he says. \u201cSing a few songs, make some money. I\u2019ll stay out of your hair.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re not in my hair,\u201d Eskel says, raising an eyebrow. \u201cYou saved my life, Jaskier, and I\u2019m very grateful for it. But the winter\u2019s closing in, and I\u2019ve got a long journey ahead of me.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cKaer Morhen?\u201d </p>\n<p>Eskel nods. \u201cI\u2019ll say hi to Geralt for you.\u201d </p>\n<p>Jaskier can\u2019t quite stop his expression twisting. \u201cYou do that,\u201d he says, a little strangled, then pastes on a smile. \u201cGood to meet you, Eskel.\u201d </p>\n<p>Eskel reaches out, grips his shoulder tight, then pulls him into a brief hug. Jaskier is, frankly, a little stunned by this whole business, but he doesn\u2019t object. \u201cI hope we meet again,\u201d he says, a gently formality in his voice, and he grips the back of Jaskier\u2019s neck, presses their foreheads together for a moment before letting him go. \u201cIt\u2019s been an honour.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cFor me, too,\u201d Jaskier says, a genuine smile creeping across his lips. \u201cSee you around, Eskel.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSee you around,\u201d Eskel answers, and turns back to his horse.</p>\n<p>Jaskier wanders back through the town, a strangely light feeling in his chest, until he finds a tavern, already noisy despite the fact it\u2019s mid-afternoon. He ducks inside, barters with the barkeep, gets a plate of bread and cheese and an ale in exchange for a performance, then leaves his pack behind the bar and takes out his lute. The tavern\u2019s patrons are average at best, some watching him and singing along with moderate enthusiasm, others just carrying on their conversations, but he earns a good double handful of coins, enough to get him a room for the night and keep him in hot meals for the next few weeks. He gets sent a couple of pints of ale, too, which he drinks slowly as the afternoon turns into the evening, then the barkeep offers him a bowl of soup, on the house, and he accepts with a smile. </p>\n<p>He plays until his fingers are numb, until his voice is going hoarse, until it\u2019s getting difficult to keep his eyes open because, well, he has been awake for going on two days now. He bows out with a larger smattering of applause than he expected, collects up his earnings, and steps out of the tavern with a friendly wave from the barkeep. </p>\n<p>It\u2019s cold outside, and getting colder. Jaskier wraps his arms around himself, his breath just starting to mist on the air, and starts back towards the inn, footsteps a little heavier than usual. There\u2019s a part of him that\u2019s sort of hoping he runs into Eskel again before he leaves, but he knows in his heart that that wouldn\u2019t be a good idea \u2013 because it\u2019s not <i>Eskel</i> that he wants to see. The man is startlingly good company, easy with his affection, and that\u2019s brilliant, sure, but it\u2019s not what Jaskier actually wants. </p>\n<p>Jaskier sighs, rubs at his eyes. \u201cFuck,\u201d he mutters to himself and doesn\u2019t think about golden eyes and silver-white hair, about bitter words in the bitter mountain air, about loss and heartbreak and all the other things that he sings about to strangers in taverns across the continent. He hums a few bars of <i>Her Sweet Kiss</i> under his breath as he treads the cobbles of this sleepy backwoods town, then frowns as he glances up at the bright moon overhead \u2013 because the edges of its horns are sort of\u2026 fuzzy? </p>\n<p>It only takes a moment.</p>\n<p>Jaskier pauses, thinks about the taste in his mouth, soup and ale and something else, bitter across the back of his tongue. \u201cOh, <i>shit</i>,\u201d he says, comes to a halt on the cobbles\u2014<i>swaying!</i>\u2014and that\u2019s when he hears it, behind him, quiet enough that he didn\u2019t hear it before over his own humming. </p>\n<p>Footsteps. </p>\n<p>Fear slicks cold through his stomach. </p>\n<p>He\u2019s not far from the inn, he\u2019s pretty sure about that, but the streets are unfamiliar in the dark \u2013 and add that to the fact that he\u2019s pretty sure he\u2019s been drugged because the houses are currently twisting around the edges, well, it\u2019s not looking good right about now. \u201cBollocks,\u201d he husks under his breath, tries to grope for the knife in his boot but instead just finds himself on his hands and knees on the cobbles, breath hitching, head inordinately heavy. His lute cases slides off his back, thuds to the ground, and then the footsteps are getting louder, too loud to just be one person, three, maybe even four. He\u2019s being grabbed, hoisted to his feet, held between two men wearing what he\u2019s pretty sure is <i>Nilfgaardian armour</i>, and oh, shit. </p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s him,\u201d a voice says, slurred through whatever they\u2019ve drugged him with \u2013 he shouldn\u2019t have drunk that fucking ale, Geralt always <i>told</i> him not to drink the ale that strangers bought him. \u201cThe witcher\u2019s bard.\u201d </p>\n<p>Jaskier tries to protest, but the only sound that comes out is garbled moaning. </p>\n<p>\u201cCome on,\u201d another voice says in a pronounced Nilfgaardian accent \u2013 and, shit, Jaskier knows there\u2019s a war on, knows that Cintra has fallen and everything\u2019s going to shit, but he was hoping that he was far north enough that he was <i>safe</i>. Apparently fucking not, and that voice is saying, \u201cLet\u2019s get him out of here.\u201d </p>\n<p>And then Jaskier\u2019s being dragged away, feet battering limply against the cobbles, barely even able to keep his head up \u2013 and he\u2019s been in danger before, sure, faced bandits and monsters and a heartbroken witcher, full of wrath on the top of a mountain, but he doesn\u2019t think he\u2019s ever been this <i>afraid</i> before. The Nilfgaardians\u2014oh shit, what has he done to piss the bloody <i>Nilfgaardians</i> off?!\u2014chat casually over his head, easy, laughing, barely even acknowledging the fact that they\u2019re drugging and kidnapping a humble bard \u2013 but he knows this isn\u2019t good. <i>The witcher\u2019s bard</i>, they said, and that was what Eskel said, too: <i>You\u2019re Geralt\u2019s bard.</i> </p>\n<p>Even now, he can\u2019t get away from Geralt of fucking Rivia. </p>\n<p>Jaskier makes a moue of noise in the back of his throat, broken and panicked.</p>\n<p>\u201c<i>Hey!</i>\u201d </p>\n<p>The Nilfgaardians stop in their tracks, but Jaskier\u2019s head is lolling against his chest at this point so he can\u2019t exactly see much. His head is also getting fuzzier and fuzzier, so he\u2019s pretty sure that he\u2019s on the verge of passing out \u2013 and all of a sudden he\u2019s falling, slipping, only being held up by one arm anymore and then not at all, he\u2019s on his knees, he\u2019s slumping forward, hitting the cobbles hard, something warm and sticky dripping down the side of his face, and, well.</p>\n<p>Everything goes black for a while.</p>\n<p>Jaskier is woken rudely by his stomach emptying itself into a bucket. He comes to mid-vomit, bile staining the back of his throat, gut tied in painful, angry knots, and curls up as much as he can, spittle hanging thick and slick from his lips. </p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re alright, bard,\u201d a gruff voice says, and he absently becomes aware that there\u2019s a hand rubbing circles on his back. \u201cCome on, I know there\u2019s more in there. Keep going.\u201d </p>\n<p>Obediently Jaskier turns his head back to the bucket and vomits again, yellow bile streaked with something ominously black and shiny. He lies there for a second, head hanging off the edge of the bed, panting, then manages a very eloquent, \u201c<i>What?</i>\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cYou were drugged,\u201d that same voice says, and Jaskier is carefully rolled back onto the bed. \u201cAnd then some lovely Nilfgaardians tried to kidnap you.\u201d </p>\n<p>The first thing Jaskier sees is bright golden-yellow eyes, focused on him sharp and keen, and for a second adrenaline floods through his abused gut. \u201cGeralt?\u201d he asks, muttered and hazy.</p>\n<p>\u201cNot exactly,\u201d the golden eyes say, and the face resolves into Eskel, frowning and concerned. \u201cHow you feeling?\u201d </p>\n<p>Jaskier moans, which he figures answers that question eloquently enough.</p>\n<p>\u201cNeed to vomit again?\u201d </p>\n<p>Jaskier shakes his head as much as he can. \u201c \u2018M alright,\u201d he says, then refocuses on Eskel. \u201c \u2018S you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s me,\u201d Eskel says, eyebrow cocked. \u201cHappened to be coming back from collecting my fee from the Salimans when I saw some poor drunk fool getting manhandled in the street ahead of me. Didn\u2019t think much of it to begin with, but then I saw the lute and I smelled your scent and the drugs, and I figured I\u2019d get involved.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTh\u2019nks.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome,\u201d Eskel says, settling himself into a chair next to the bed that Jaskier\u2019s currently sprawled out across. \u201cNow go to sleep, bard. I\u2019ll be here when you wake up.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jaskier figures he might as well do as he\u2019s told. He sleeps. </p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>When Jaskier wakes again, it\u2019s to the smell of fresh bread and a soft, slightly tone-deaf humming. He lies still for a while, just listening, cataloguing the sick feeling in his stomach, the ache in his limbs, the faint throbbing pain in his head and the bruised tightness in his knees, sorting it all out as much as he can. He opens his eyes eventually, blinking hazily at the ceiling, careful not to move too much because, well, he doesn\u2019t really want to vomit everywhere again. </p>\n<p>\u201cMorning sunshine,\u201d Eskel says, perched in the chair next to him, feet propped on the end of the bed. He\u2019s eating a hunk of bread, dropping crumbs all over himself, and he looks remarkably relaxed given that he\u2019s got a drugged bard in his bed. \u201cHow you feeling?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBetter, I think,\u201d Jaskier says, pulling himself up against the headboard. He rests his hand on his stomach, then makes the mistake of running his tongue over his teeth, nearly gags again. \u201c<i>Gods</i>, my mouth tastes foul.\u201d </p>\n<p>Eskel roots around in his pocket for a minute, then passes him a sprig of mint. \u201cChew this,\u201d he says. \u201cShould help.\u201d </p>\n<p>Jaskier accepts the mint and does as he says. It helps a little, and he spits the chewed herb out into his palm, swaps it for the glass of water Eskel offers him next. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d he asks. </p>\n<p>\u201cA couple of Nilfgaardian soldiers drugged you and tried to kidnap you,\u201d Eskel says, shredding a piece of bread with his fingertips. \u201cI saved you.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cRepaying the favour?\u201d </p>\n<p>Eskel doesn\u2019t answer. He flicks a shredded pile of crumbs onto the floor, tosses the rest of the bread into Jaskier\u2019s lap. \u201cI spoke to one of the Nilfgaardians while you were sleeping,\u201d he says. </p>\n<p>Jaskier pauses. \u201cI\u2019m assuming \u2018spoke to\u2019 is a euphemism for \u2018beat up\u2019?\u201d </p>\n<p>Eskel hums his agreement \u2013 and, oh, there it is, <i>there\u2019s</i> Geralt\u2019s brother in arms. \u201cHe said some\u2026 worrying things,\u201d he says, folding his arms. His eyes are bright and fixed on Jaskier. \u201cYou\u2019re a wanted man, bard.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jaskier\u2019s heart seizes in his chest. \u201cI\u2019m a what now?\u201d </p>\n<p>Eskel\u2019s lips press tight together. \u201cYou\u2019re wanted by Nilfgaard,\u201d he says. </p>\n<p>\u201cFor <i>what?!</i>\u201d Jaskier squeaks. </p>\n<p>\u201cFor Geralt,\u201d Eskel answers with a sigh. \u201cApparently my idiot brother has something that they want, but they\u2019re having trouble finding him.\u201d </p>\n<p>Understanding dawns. \u201cSo instead, they look for me,\u201d he says slowly. \u201cShit, I heard them say something about me being the witcher\u2019s bard.\u201d Fear floods his throat. \u201cThey were going to\u2026 do what you did to that Nilfgaardian to me, weren\u2019t they?\u201d</p>\n<p>Eskel watches him carefully. \u201cIt\u2019s likely.\u201d </p>\n<p>Jaskier lets out a considered breath. \u201cRight,\u201d he says slowly. \u201cAnd I\u2019m guessing they\u2019re not the only ones looking for me?\u201d</p>\n<p>Eskel shakes his head.</p>\n<p>Jaskier is brave in many ways. He\u2019ll drag a witcher out of the way of a werewolf\u2019s claw, he\u2019ll face the wrath of a jilted spouse, he\u2019ll offer his heart to a friend and hope that it doesn\u2019t get torn apart on the top of a windy, dragon-infested mountain. What he\u2019s not so hot on, however, is violence and torture. \u201cI guess I\u2019ll be lying low for a while,\u201d he says, unable to stop himself from sounding strangled. \u201cI\u2019ll\u2026 hide. Somewhere. Should probably avoid Oxenfurt, that\u2019s a fairly obvious place to look for me. And Novigrad, Vizima. Basically all the major cities. I guess I\u2019ll have to stick to little backwoods places like this\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cJaskier.\u201d </p>\n<p>Jaskier knows he\u2019s spiralling. He snaps his jaw shut with a click.</p>\n<p>Eskel\u2019s studying him keenly. \u201cYou\u2019re coming with me,\u201d he says, leaning forward, elbows propped on his knees. </p>\n<p>Jaskier blinks at him for a second, not understanding. \u201cBut you\u2019re going to Kaer Morhen.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cExactly.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cHumans aren\u2019t allowed at Kaer Morhen.\u201d</p>\n<p>Eskel\u2019s lips twist. \u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 not strictly true,\u201d he says. \u201cIf you come with a witcher, you\u2019re fine. The others might be a little frosty at first, but, well, it\u2019s not like you\u2019re a stranger.\u201d </p>\n<p>There\u2019s a bitter taste in the back of Jaskier\u2019s throat that isn\u2019t just the aftertaste of his own vomit. \u201cThat\u2019s not a good idea.\u201d </p>\n<p>Eskel shrugs. \u201cI figure it makes sense,\u201d he says. \u201cYou\u2019re at risk because of a witcher. It stands to reason that a witcher should protect you. And there\u2019s nowhere safer than Kaer Morhen.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cI appreciate the gesture,\u201d Jaskier says, the hunk of bread crushed in his palm. \u201cI really do. But, Eskel, I can\u2019t accept. I can\u2019t come with you.\u201d </p>\n<p>Eskel frowns. \u201cYou know I can\u2019t come with you, either,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m a witcher, not a bodyguard. And if you stay in the open, even if I\u2019m here to protect you, it\u2019ll just be attack after attack. Do you want to spend the next however many years of this godsdamned war in <i>hiding</i>?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t,\u201d Jaskier says, as level as he can manage. \u201cBut please trust me when I say that I am not welcome at Kaer Morhen, Eskel.\u201d </p>\n<p>Realisation spreads slowly across Eskel\u2019s face. \u201cWhat did my idiot of a brother do?\u201d </p>\n<p>Jaskier grits his teeth and does his best to push the heartbreak down as far as he can manage. \u201cHe made it quite clear what he thinks of me,\u201d he says, bright and cheery. \u201cThat I might have spent the last few decades of my life thinking that we were friends, that we were\u2026\u201d He swallows down the word more. \u201cWell, that we were friends. But I was apparently reading that whole situation wrong. He\u2026 set me straight. Said some fairly explicit things involving me being responsible for everything that went wrong in his life, and about how the one blessing he\u2019d ask from life would be for me\u2026 to not be in it.\u201d Jaskier takes a breath. It\u2019s surprisingly steady. \u201cThat was, oh, over a year ago now? Haven\u2019t seen him since.\u201d He snorts. \u201cSo the Nilfgaardians are barking up the wrong tree anyway \u2013 I couldn\u2019t tell them where Geralt is if I wanted to. May as well just leave me to their tender mercies. It\u2019s not like it\u2019ll do Geralt any harm.\u201d </p>\n<p>Eskel just studies him for a long moment, expression unreadable. \u201cDo you know how I knew you were Geralt\u2019s bard before I even spoke to you?\u201d he asks.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s a bit of a tangent, but Jaskier figures he\u2019s probably best to just go with it. \u201cBecause of the unrivalled storytelling ability and musicality that\u2019s led to me being famous across the continent?\u201d </p>\n<p>Eskel snorts. \u201cNo, not that,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s because of the way you smell, Jaskier.\u201d </p>\n<p>Jaskier briefly remembers Eskel half-conscious, hazed with pain, grabbing at his arm until his nostrils flared wide and he breathed in deep. \u201cHow I <i>smell?</i>\u201d he echoes slowly. \u201cAre you saying that I smell like <i>Geralt</i>?\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cNot exactly,\u201d Eskel says. \u201cIt\u2019s actually more like <i>Geralt</i> smells like <i>you</i>.\u201d </p>\n<p>Jaskier\u2019s pretty sure he\u2019s hearing things. \u201cExplain that one more time.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cWhenever I see him,\u201d Eskel explains, \u201cwhether it\u2019s at Kaer Morhen, or if it\u2019s whenever we bump into each other on the road, he smells like\u2026 things a witcher isn\u2019t supposed to smell like. Sometimes it\u2019s lavender, sometimes it\u2019s oranges. Sandalwood, rose oil, honeysuckle.\u201d </p>\n<p>Jaskier frowns. \u201cThose are the scents I use.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI know,\u201d Eskel answers, nodding. \u201cI saw all the little vials of oil in your pack when I dragged you in here, took the liberty of having a sniff. Those are the scents I recognise from Geralt\u2019s clothes, his hair, his\u2026 fucking <i>horse</i>, sometimes. Because you know what he\u2019s like, he doesn\u2019t exactly <i>bathe</i> particularly often \u2013 so scents like that stick around. I\u2019ve got used to them.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cBut surely if you can smell them, he can smell them, too?\u201d Jaskier asks. \u201cI know you witchers have weird heightened senses \u2013 so if Geralt stinks of my very expensive orange oil, presumably he <i>knows</i> he stinks of my very expensive orange oil?\u201d </p>\n<p>Eskel just looks at him. </p>\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d Jaskier says. \u201cRight.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re coming to Kaer Morhen,\u201d Eskel says. \u201cWhatever that fucking idiot said to you, I\u2019m pretty sure that he\u2019d never speak to me again if I let you get kidnapped and tortured. And, well, for a witcher, \u2018never\u2019 is either a very, very long time or a very, very short time.\u201d </p>\n<p>Jaskier looks down at the mangled bread in his lap. \u201cYou should know,\u201d he says, slowly, carefully, digging his thumbnails into what\u2019s left of the crust, \u201cthat I\u2019m sort of \u2013 kind of \u2013 maybe \u2013 completely in love with him.\u201d </p>\n<p>Eskel sighs. \u201cI figured as much,\u201d he says. \u201cBut you know what, bard? I like you. And I\u2019m not about to let you throw your damn life away just because you want to avoid being in the same room as a bloody fool who isn\u2019t good at emotions and who, I\u2019m guessing from the way you stink of adrenaline and sadness right now, pretty much broke your heart.\u201d </p>\n<p>Jaskier\u2019s smile is twisted. \u201cNo \u2018pretty much\u2019 about it.\u201d </p>\n<p>Eskel shakes his head and levers himself out of his chair. \u201cWe should get going as soon as we can,\u201d he says. \u201cThose Nilfgaardians, they\u2019ll be back \u2013 probably with reinforcements. We don\u2019t want to be here when they return.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jaskier shifts against the bed, testing his strength. He\u2019s a little unsteady, yes, but he\u2019s pretty sure that he\u2019s strong enough to ride a horse out of this rickety little town in the middle of nowhere. \u201cYou didn\u2019t kill them?\u201d he asks. </p>\n<p>Eskel\u2019s packing his saddlebags, and he glances back at Jaskier. \u201cI didn\u2019t,\u201d he confirms. \u201cWitchers don\u2019t kill humans if we can help it, bard. You should know that.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cI do,\u201d Jaskier says, then thinks about the creep of paralytic through his body, the roughness of the hands on his body, the crippling fear. \u201cJust wishful thinking.\u201d </p>\n<p>Eskel just studies him a moment longer. \u201cGather your things,\u201d he says eventually. \u201cWe\u2019ll get some food downstairs, then get on the road.\u201d </p>\n<p>Jaskier nods, and does as he\u2019s told. </p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>For the first day, Eskel hoists Jaskier up in front of him on Llwyd, steadying him whenever he loses his balance \u2013 which is fairly regularly, given that he was drugged and also cracked his head pretty solidly on the cobbles when he fell. The wooziness fades eventually, though, and after a night\u2019s moderately decent sleep under the stars, Jaskier\u2019s feeling strong enough to walk. Eskel insists he ride behind him for another day, though, and Jaskier\u2019s not going to argue with a free ride. He says as much to Eskel, who snorts with laughter and says, \u201cAnd I thought you were supposed to be good with words.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jaskier flushes, and shuts up.</p>\n<p>Travelling with Eskel is remarkably similar to travelling with Geralt, after a while. It\u2019s the same rhythm, the same patterns: moving during the day, sometimes walking, sometimes riding, then finding somewhere to rest at night, an inn or a room above a tavern when they\u2019re in more populous areas, a stable or an outhouse when they\u2019re in farmland, sometimes a fire underneath the open sky. The main difference is that when Jaskier chatters away, Eskel chatters back. When he strums his lute, when he sings, Eskel doesn\u2019t just roll his eyes and ignore him \u2013 he listens, he responds, he asks questions. Sometimes he even offers <i>suggestions</i>, which confuses Jaskier so much he has to ask him to stop.</p>\n<p>He does adopt some of the suggestions, though. Eskel apparently has a way with rhymes. </p>\n<p>They\u2019re camping out one night, Jaskier wrapped up in two blankets and lying probably too close to the fire to be strictly safe, when Eskel stirs. \u201cJaskier?\u201d</p>\n<p>Jaskier opens his eyes, glances up. \u201cYeah?\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cDid you and Geralt ever\u2026\u201d He trails off.</p>\n<p>Jaskier frowns. \u201cEver what?\u201d </p>\n<p>Eskel makes a noise of frustration that\u2019s so startlingly familiar it makes Jaskier laugh quietly. \u201cFuck,\u201d he says flatly.</p>\n<p>Heat rushes to Jaskier\u2019s cheeks. \u201cAh, no,\u201d he says. \u201cNo, we never did\u2026 that.\u201d </p>\n<p>Eskel\u2019s quiet for a moment. \u201cWhy not?\u201d</p>\n<p>This is a very surreal conversation. \u201cBecause he\u2019s not interested?\u201d Jaskier answers, voice pitching higher. \u201cI\u2019m not even sure he\u2019s interested in <i>men</i> \u2013 I\u2019ve only ever seen him with women, whether he\u2019s paying for their company or just\u2026 moping after violet-eyed sorceresses.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s more than one of those?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI was exaggerating,\u201d Jaskier says with a sigh, then cranes his head up, looks over at Eskel. \u201cYou know about Yennefer?\u201d</p>\n<p>Eskel hums. \u201cHe\u2019s mentioned her.\u201d </p>\n<p>Jaskier\u2019s heart twists in his chest, and he looks away. \u201cOf course,\u201d he says, and changes the subject. \u201cWhy do you ask? Is this your way of flirting with me?\u201d </p>\n<p>Eskel laughs. \u201cSorry, bard, you\u2019re not my type,\u201d he says. \u201cMissing a few parts, if you know what I mean.\u201d He pauses, and for once Jaskier is content just to listen to the quiet crackle of the fire, the rustle of the leaves in the late-autumn breeze. \u201cGeralt is, though, you know.\u201d </p>\n<p>Jasker blinks. \u201cHe\u2019s what?\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cInterested in men,\u201d Eskel answers. </p>\n<p>Jaskier lies there a second longer, staring at the heart of the fire, then hoists himself up on his elbow and peers at Eskel. Eskel seems unfazed by this whole bizarre conversation, hands tucked behind his head, eyes closed. If not for the fact that he seems to be insistent on discussing Geralt of fucking Rivia\u2019s sexual preferences, Jaskier would think he was asleep. \u201cWhy are you telling me this?\u201d Jaskier asks, not even bothering to keep the tightness out of his voice. \u201cYou know about Yennefer, you know that he loves her. And if you don\u2019t, well, let me tell you: <i>he fucking loves her</i>. He\u2026 bound her to him with a djinn wish, he\u2019s fucked her across the continent, he mopes around after her like a kicked puppy. So why exactly, Eskel, are you telling me this? To, what, mock me? Oh, hey, Jaskier, here\u2019s what you <i>could have had</i>?\u201d</p>\n<p>Eskel opens his eyes and looks over at him. \u201cI\u2019m not mocking you.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cThen what <i>are</i> you doing?\u201d Eskel seems lost for words for a moment, which is a witcher state that Jaskier is more than familiar with. He doesn\u2019t give him a chance to answer. \u201cWhatever it is, stop. This whole <i>Kaer Morhen for my own safety</i> bollocks is going to be hard enough for me as it is. I don\u2019t need you trying to make it better but actually just making it <i>worse</i>, okay?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Eskel says. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Jaskier.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jaskier huffs, wraps his blankets tighter around his shoulders, and rolls onto his side, facing away from the fire. He doesn\u2019t sleep for a long while. </p>\n<p>In the morning, Eskel doesn\u2019t bring it up again, and they travel onwards.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Less than a week later, they stop for the evening in a small hamlet right at the edge of the foothills. Jaskier\u2019s been avoiding playing so far, figuring that advertising himself as a bard who tends to sing about witchers is probably a spectacularly bad idea, given that he\u2019s seen Nilfgaardian insignia and heard Nilfgaardian accents pretty much everywhere, even this far north \u2013 but here? Here, he must be safe. </p>\n<p>Eskel doesn\u2019t look too convinced. \u201cAre you sure?\u201d he asks.</p>\n<p>Jaskier shrugs, twisting one of his lute\u2019s tuning pegs. \u201cNo,\u201d he says. \u201cBut aren\u2019t you getting sick of being my only audience?\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cNot particularly.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cWell, <i>I\u2019m</i> getting sick of you being my only audience,\u201d Jaskier says lightly. \u201cPlus, we\u2019re going to need to start heading into the mountains soon, right? If I can earn us a decent amount of money today, then we can stock up on supplies.\u201d He plucks at his doublet, silken and definitely not winter-appropriate. \u201cI will definitely freeze to death if this is all I have.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Eskel says. \u201cBut I\u2019m not leaving you alone. I\u2019ll be right here.\u201d </p>\n<p>Jaskier flashes him a smile. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like you care.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cI <i>do</i> care,\u201d Eskel says, eyebrow raised. \u201cRemember: I\u2019m not Geralt. I\u2019m capable of expressing my emotions in a functional way.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jaskier laughs. \u201cVery true.\u201d He slides away from their little corner table, swaggers up to the bar with all the confidence he can and barters with the barman for a while. The man is actually fairly enthusiastic about having a bard play for his patrons, and Jaskier gets set up quickly, starts with a couple of dancingly-quick jigs before sliding into the epic tales of adventure and derring-do that he\u2019s probably best known for. He peppers in love songs and, as the night gets deeper, a few erotic ballads, carefully avoiding the drinks that are sent his way, only drinking what\u2019s given to him directly from the barman or, on a couple of occasions, passed to him by Eskel\u2014he could get used to be treated like this by his witcher\u2014and, to be honest, he\u2019s feeling it, and so is his audience.</p>\n<p>This is why he performs, he thinks absently, grinning into laughing faces, stamping along with dozens of thumping feet, dancing between the tables, all eyes on him. Nights like this, where the ale is sweet and the food is hot and he\u2019s just\u2026 <i>happy</i>. </p>\n<p>He glances over at the table in the corner, just once, lips caught in a smile that he can\u2019t control, genuine, ecstatic, wanting to share that joy \u2013 and when he sees Eskel\u2019s answering smile, his stomach drops, just a little. His fingers falter and he has to catch himself before he loses the thread of the song, so he turns back, loses himself in his audience, in his performance, in the character that he puts on stage for the whole world to see. </p>\n<p>For the briefest second, he forgot that he wasn\u2019t with Geralt. </p>\n<p>There\u2019s a young man sitting at one of the tables closest to the bar, and Jaskier hasn\u2019t missed the fact that his eyes have been fixed on him, intent and intense, the whole way through his performance. It\u2019s an expression that Jaskier knows very well by now. He\u2019s been mostly ignoring that fact so far because, well, he\u2019s not really been feeling the need for any rough and tumble for a while now \u2013 but all of a sudden there\u2019s pain in his heart, sharp and biting, and he wants to lose himself in more than just music. For his last few songs he returns the man\u2019s glances, just enough that it doesn\u2019t look like he\u2019s neglecting the rest of his audience, flashes him smiles and attention and dances his fingers along his shoulders, narrower than he wants but still broader than his own. </p>\n<p>The man\u2019s eyes flare, hungry and bright, and Jaskier feels an answering need start to build in his belly. </p>\n<p>He finishes his performance to applause that borders on the rapturous, then goes to Eskel\u2019s table, lays his lute on the tabletop. \u201cI\u2019m just gonna\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe guy by the bar?\u201d Eskel interrupts. </p>\n<p>Jaskier flushes. \u201cThat obvious?\u201d </p>\n<p>Eskel shrugs. \u201cYou sure that\u2019s safe?\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cWho are you, my mother?\u201d Jaskier laughs. \u201cYes, dear, I\u2019ll be fine. I\u2019m sure I can survive a fumble in the stables. Just keep an eye on my lute?\u201d </p>\n<p>Eskel rolls his eyes. \u201cI\u2019m not your fucking butler,\u201d he mutters, but Jaskier\u2019s spent enough time with him, now, that he can hear the agreement. </p>\n<p>Jaskier flashes him a smile. \u201cWon\u2019t be long.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you won\u2019t.\u201d </p>\n<p>Jaskier is going to ignore that.</p>\n<p>The young man is still watching him, green eyes heavy, and Jaskier meets his gaze, cocks his head towards the door to the stable. Something Jaskier can\u2019t quite define flashes in the man\u2019s expression and he gets to his feet, follows Jaskier out. This isn\u2019t actually what Jaskier usually prefers to do, the anonymous shag in the alleyway behind the tavern, he usually likes a little romance, a little flirting, a meeting of minds \u2013 but he can still feel that pain in his heart, that fucking <i>heartbreak</i>, and there\u2019s nothing better for heartbreak than to go and fall in love with someone else.</p>\n<p>That ignores the fact that he\u2019s been in love with Geralt for the last few decades of his life, of course.</p>\n<p>The young man grabs him pretty much the second the door shuts behind them, pushes him up against the wall of the stable and kisses him hard. Jaskier gives as good as he gets, chasing the taste of beer on the man\u2019s tongue, carding his hands through his hair, and then the man\u2019s hand is reaching down between them, grabbing at his crotch, squeezing maybe a little too hard \u2013 but not hard enough to stop his cock starting to harden. Jaskier groans and the young man laughs, sucks a bruise into the side of his neck as he starts to work on the laces of his trousers. Jaskier lets his head fall back against the stable wall, eyes closed, feeling the young man\u2019s cock rutting hard and rough against his thigh. </p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s him.\u201d </p>\n<p>The young man\u2019s fingers still, and he makes a strange gurgling noise in the back of his throat. </p>\n<p>Jaskier\u2019s eyes fly open, and all of a sudden he\u2019s assaulted by the smell of blood, sharp and acrid. The young man whose hand was halfway down his trousers a heartbeat ago is dead on the ground at his feet, a knife clean through his throat, and there are three strangers arrayed in front of him, eyes hard, hands scarred, two men and a woman. Shit, Jaskier knows mercenaries when he sees them \u2013 and the woman kneels, tugs the knife out of the young man\u2019s throat, wipes it clean on a nearby haybale. \u201cI recognise him,\u201d she says. \u201cSeen him before with the white wolf.\u201d</p>\n<p>\n<i>Oh, shit. </i>\n</p>\n<p>\u201cI think you must have got me confused with someone else,\u201d Jaskier says, holding up his hands placatingly, trousers still unlaced but erection very much deflated. </p>\n<p>\u201cNo, we haven\u2019t,\u201d the man to his right says, shaved head gleaming in the faint light from the tavern. \u201cYou\u2019re the famous Jaskier \u2013 I saw you perform in Oxenfurt six months ago.\u201d He flashes a wicked smile, studded with gold teeth. \u201cI really admire your musicality, to be honest, but the Nilfgaardian army is offering a <i>lot</i> for your capture.\u201d </p>\n<p>Jaskier licks his lips. \u201cWe can come to some kind of arrangement, surely,\u201d he says. \u201cYou want money? I can pay you. I\u2019ve got a bag full of gold in there \u2013 you can have it.\u201d </p>\n<p>The woman laughs. \u201cWhatever you can give us, bard,\u201d she says, \u201ctrust me, Nilfgaard will give us more. They <i>really</i> want your witcher.\u201d She comes forward, grabs him by the neck of his doublet, hauls him forward with a knife to his throat. </p>\n<p>The second man cocks his head, grabs Jaskier\u2019s hands and yanks them behind his back. \u201cI heard that it\u2019s not actually the witcher they want,\u201d he says conversationally, looping rope tight around his wrists. \u201cHe\u2019s got something they\u2019re after \u2013 something about a lion cub?\u201d </p>\n<p><i>A lion cub?</i> Jaskier thinks, confused, and then: <i>Oh shit,</i> the <i>Lion Cub. </i></p>\n<p>\u201cA lion cub?\u201d the woman asks. \u201cI don\u2019t think Nilfgaard wants a fucking lion cub, idiot. They\u2019re not trying to put together a <i>menagerie</i>.\u201d </p>\n<p>The man shrugs. \u201cThat\u2019s what I heard.\u201d </p>\n<p>The first man folds his arms. \u201cI don\u2019t think it really matters,\u201d he says, eyebrow raised. \u201cThey\u2019ll pay just the same, either way.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cTrue,\u201d the woman says, and laughs brightly. \u201cWe\u2019re gonna be <i>rich</i>.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re gonna be something, that\u2019s for sure.\u201d </p>\n<p>All three mercenaries freeze, and Jaskier sags a little. \u201cThank the gods,\u201d he says. </p>\n<p>Eskel\u2019s standing in the entrance to the stables, steel sword held almost casually in his hand, and to the untrained eye he almost looks relaxed, maybe even a little drunk. Jaskier knows better, though, and he\u2019s pretty sure his would-be kidnappers are the same. \u201cSorry lads,\u201d Eskel drawls. \u201cI\u2019m going to have to ask you to untie my friend there and then get out of this place pretty sharpish, or I\u2019m going to have to use this.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cShit,\u201d Jaskier hears the woman husk. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t supposed to be <i>another</i> witcher here.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cAnd yet, here I am,\u201d Eskel grins at her. He hefts his sword, props it against his shoulder. \u201cWhat\u2019s it going to be?\u201d </p>\n<p>Jaskier hears the rattle of a sword being drawn from its sheath, and Eskel meets his gaze. \u201cJaskier,\u201d he says. </p>\n<p>\u201cEskel?\u201d Jaskier squeaks.</p>\n<p>Eskel\u2019s yellow-gold eyes are bright. \u201cGet down.\u201d </p>\n<p>Jaskier figures it\u2019s probably best to just get down. </p>\n<p>Unsurprisingly, Eskel makes short work of the three mercenaries, sustaining nothing more than a small nick to his right elbow which he actually looks pretty annoyed at himself for letting happen. The woman and the second man die on his sword before the first man throws up his hands in surrender, tosses his sword to the ground at Eskel\u2019s feet \u2013 and Eskel levels him with a crack to the back of the head, lays him out cold next to his dead friends and their dead victim. </p>\n<p>Jaskier gets to his feet and picks his way out of the mess of blood and body parts. \u201cWe should probably go,\u201d he says quietly. \u201cBefore he wakes up. Or before we\u2019re found next to a pile of corpses.\u201d </p>\n<p>Eskel sighs. \u201cGo grab our stuff,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ll get Llwyd.\u201d He pauses, glances down. \u201cMaybe do your trousers up first.\u201d </p>\n<p>They\u2019re on the road within five minutes, taking the darkened road at as fast a pace as Llwyd can manage. They sleep in the woods that night, far away from the road, and they don\u2019t dare light a fire so it\u2019s <i>cold</i>. Eskel drags Jaskier close without a word, wraps an arm around him and drapes his blanket across them both. The extra warmth helps, and Jaskier\u2019s teeth stop chattering enough for him to actually get out coherent words. \u201cI know why Nilfgaard is looking for Geralt,\u201d he says, chin buried in the rough blanket.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah?\u201d </p>\n<p>Jaskier nods, then hears Eskel make a noise of annoyance, presumably as his hair tickles his nose. \u201cThose mercenaries said that Nilfgaard is looking for a lion cub,\u201d he says, his heart beating a little faster in his chest. </p>\n<p>Eskel snorts. \u201cNilfgaard\u2019s trying to start a zoo?\u201d </p>\n<p>Jaskier rolls his eyes. \u201cThey made the same joke,\u201d he says dryly. \u201cNo, Nilfgaard isn\u2019t looking for an animal, Eskel. They\u2019re looking for the <i>Lion Cub of Cintra</i>.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cIsn\u2019t that the Cintran crown princess?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s exactly the Cintran crown princess,\u201d Jaskier says, unable to stop a certain amount of affection seeping into his voice. \u201cHer name is Cirilla.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cYou sound like you know her.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cNot well,\u201d Jaskier says, \u201cbut yeah, I do. I\u2019ve played at the Cintran court quite a lot over the years, partly because Queen Calanthe actually pays surprisingly well, but also because, well\u2026\u201d He shrugs, and Eskel smacks him in the back. \u201cI wanted to keep an eye on her. <i>Someone</i> had to, and it wasn\u2019t about to be Geralt, was it?\u201d </p>\n<p>Even Eskel\u2019s silence sounds confused. \u201cWhy would Geralt need to keep an eye on the Cintran crown princess?\u201d </p>\n<p>Jaskier twists around to face him, pulls the blankets closer around him. Eskel gives him a strange look but doesn\u2019t move away, which Jaskier really does appreciate because, you know, body heat. \u201cDid he not tell you about his Child Surprise?\u201d </p>\n<p>Eskel looks unimpressed but not particularly surprised. \u201cHe really didn\u2019t.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cCirilla is his Child Surprise,\u201d Jaskier says. There\u2019s something that might almost be pride seeping into his chest \u2013 but then, of course, it fades. He twitches a sad smile. \u201cSomething else that\u2019s my fault. And he spent\u2026 gods, years and years and <i>years</i> ignoring it, pretending it hadn\u2019t happened, that he <i>hadn\u2019t</i> tied an innocent child to him through Destiny and all that bullshit.\u201d He smiles a little wider, a little warmer. \u201cHe must have gone back for her,\u201d he says. \u201cHe must have found her.\u201d </p>\n<p>Eskel studies him, yellow-gold eyes bright in the moonlight. \u201cYou sound like you\u2019re proud of him.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cI think I am,\u201d Jaskier says simply. </p>\n<p>Eskel huffs out a quiet laugh. \u201cYou\u2026 confuse me, Jaskier,\u201d he says eventually. \u201cI can smell your adrenaline and your hurt every time I so much as <i>mention</i> my brother\u2014with good reason, from what you\u2019ve told me\u2014but here you are, feeling <i>proud</i> of him for, what, demonstrating basic emotional decency?\u201d </p>\n<p>Jaskier smiles. \u201cYou know him better than I do,\u201d he says. \u201cYou know how hard basic emotions are for him.\u201d </p>\n<p>Eskel hums. \u201cYou\u2019re not wrong.\u201d He pauses for a second, then says, \u201cYou know that if he gives you any grief when we get to Kaer Morhen, you just tell me and I will kick the shit out of him.\u201d </p>\n<p>Jaskier barks a laugh. \u201cMy hero,\u201d he says dryly. \u201cAlthough I\u2019m offended that you don\u2019t think I can beat him up myself.\u201d </p>\n<p>In the darkness, Jaskier can just about make out Eskel\u2019s raised eyebrow. \u201cAre you saying that you could?\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cI could definitely write a very rude song about him,\u201d Jaskier tries. </p>\n<p>Eskel snorts. \u201cGo to sleep, bard,\u201d he says. \u201cWe need to cover a lot of ground tomorrow, so you\u2019ll need to be well-rested.\u201d </p>\n<p>Jaskier shifts around until he\u2019s back in his original position, back pressed to Eskel\u2019s chest, Eskel\u2019s arm thrown lazily across his waist. It\u2019s strange, really, because he remembers cold nights like this with Geralt, remembers the way that Geralt\u2019s touch would be oddly tentative, the way his breath would pause, stutter on the back of his neck, remembers the intimacy of the gesture, of the physicality \u2013 but now he\u2019s in exactly the same position with Eskel, the witcher curled around him, flush to him in pretty much every way he can be, and it\u2019s just\u2026 practical. Nothing more, nothing less. </p>\n<p>Jaskier closes his eyes, and tries not to think about Geralt. </p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>They stop in the next town they come across and spend pretty much all the money Jaskier has left. Eskel takes a handful of gold coins to buy as much food as Llwyd can carry, then Jaskier goes and spends pretty much everything he has left on warm clothes. A fur-lined cloak which is pleasantly practical <i>and</i> sharply stylish. A thick woollen jacket and dark woollen trousers. Full-length undergarments that stretch to the wrists and the ankle, which definitely aren\u2019t good for seducing fair maidens but will probably keep him alive on the top of a snowy mountain. He\u2019s midway through bartering for a pair of solid winter boots when Eskel shows up and tosses him a pair that he\u2019s already bought. \u201cThese are cheaper <i>and</i> better quality,\u201d he says, eyeing everything on the cobbler\u2019s stall with disdain. \u201cYou got longjohns?\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201c<i>Yes</i>, I\u2019ve got longjohns,\u201d Jaskier answers. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be seen dead in them, but I\u2019ve got them.\u201d </p>\n<p>Eskel snorts and pulls him away. \u201cCome on,\u201d he says. \u201cOne last night in an inn, hopefully where I <i>won\u2019t</i> have to save you from getting kidnapped, and we\u2019ll set out for the keep in the morning.\u201d </p>\n<p>Despite everything, excitement starts to bubble up in Jaskier\u2019s chest. \u201cKaer Morhen,\u201d he says, almost dreamily. \u201cFuck, I can\u2019t believe you\u2019re actually taking me there.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cBlame my brother for that,\u201d Eskel says, amused, and Jaskier tries his best not to flinch. \u201cAlthough, to be honest, if I was him, I would have brought you there <i>years</i> ago.\u201d </p>\n<p>Jaskier gives him an odd look. \u201cYou would have?\u201d </p>\n<p>Eskel shrugs, hefting a bag of dried foodstuffs onto his shoulder. \u201cYou\u2019re a part of his life, Jaskier,\u201d he says, \u201ceven though he\u2019s doing his best to ignore that. And I\u2019ll be honest \u2013 you and your songs have made the last few decades easier for us. Even if some fuckers tend to take the whole <i>toss a coin </i>thing far too literally.\u201d </p>\n<p>Jaskier stares at Eskel a moment longer. \u201cI\u2019ll say it again,\u201d he says. \u201cWhy did I have to meet <i>Geralt</i>?\u201d </p>\n<p>Eskel looks at him sideways, an odd light in his eyes. \u201cI\u2019d say it was Destiny,\u201d he says softly, \u201cif I didn\u2019t know how badly Geralt tends to react to that word.\u201d </p>\n<p>Jaskier flashes him a smile. \u201cThank you,\u201d he says after a moment. </p>\n<p>\u201cFor what?\u201d Eskel asks, head cocked to one side.</p>\n<p>\u201cSaving me from Nilfgaardian torture,\u201d Jaskier says, shrugging. \u201cProtecting me. Offering me sanctuary in probably the most precious place in the world to you witchers. Letting me complain about Geralt as much as I want.\u201d </p>\n<p>Eskel raises an eyebrow. \u201cYou really don\u2019t complain about him that much.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cYou know what I mean,\u201d Jaskier says. </p>\n<p>\u201cYou saved my life, Jaskier,\u201d Eskel says. \u201cReally, honestly, truly saved my life. Found me bleeding out and unconscious in a fucking wyvern graveyard \u2013 and you\u2019d never met me before, probably never even <i>heard</i> of me, given how fucking tight-lipped Geralt can be, but you stitched me up, got me to shelter, and saved my life. I don\u2019t think you realise how much of a debt I owe you.\u201d </p>\n<p>Jaskier blinks. \u201cYou don\u2019t owe me anything.\u201d </p>\n<p>Eskel just laughs, and strides ahead to the inn. </p>\n<p>They set off the next morning at practically the crack of dawn, Jaskier grumbling and rubbing sleep from his eyes, Eskel subdued and oddly taciturn. The path into the mountains is steep and winding from the get go, rocky and uneven under Jaskier\u2019s boots, and within a few hours Eskel is on foot next to him, leading Llwyd by his reins. Jaskier\u2019s sweating through his undershirt before long and he\u2019s sure to let Eskel know, keeping up a rambling litany of complaints and observations about the foothills around them\u2014\u201cIs that a bear?\u201d \u201cGods, when was the last time the local council came up here? This path needs some work.\u201d \u201cIs that a wolf?\u201d \u201cHow am I supposed to compose when I\u2019m trying not to trip over my feet every five minutes?\u201d \u201cIs that a snow leopard?\u201d\u2014but, for once, Eskel doesn\u2019t push back. He offers the occasional remark, catches Jaskier by the back of his jacket when he\u2019s about to stumble face-first into a tree, but for the most part, he\u2019s as monosyllabic as Geralt. </p>\n<p>They stop for the night in the first of a series of bothies that\u2019s scattered up the mountainside, and it\u2019s cold, yes, but it\u2019s not unbearable. They eat a meal of dried meat and the freshest bread they\u2019re going to have until they reach the keep, and Jaskier studies Eskel, forehead furrowed. \u201cIs something wrong?\u201d he asks eventually, when the quiet has stretched between them for a few moments too long.</p>\n<p>Eskel glances up at him, offers him a tired smile. \u201cI\u2019ve been quiet today, I know,\u201d he says. \u201cSorry. It\u2019s not you, Jaskier. I\u2019m just\u2026\u201d He shrugs, pulls his cloak tighter around his shoulders. \u201cIt\u2019s been a long year,\u201d he says eventually. \u201cA lot\u2019s happened \u2013 and this war\u2026\u201d He shakes his head. \u201cWintering at Kaer Morhen is when we go home,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s when we get a chance to recover from all the shit that\u2019s been thrown at us during the year. But this year?\u201d He shakes his head again, faster, tighter. \u201cI\u2019m getting the feeling that this winter is just going to make things more complicated.\u201d </p>\n<p>Jaskier\u2019s quiet for a moment. \u201cI was starting to wonder if you were regretting bringing me with you.\u201d </p>\n<p>Eskel flashes him a smile, reaches out and squeezes his shoulder. \u201cNot everything\u2019s about you, bard,\u201d he says, eyes glinting with humour.</p>\n<p>Jaskier scoffs. \u201c<i>Everything</i> is about me, thank you very much,\u201d he says, and they spend the rest of the night in comfortable silence. </p>\n<p>The next few days pass in much the same way. Eskel\u2019s quieter than usual but Jaskier doesn\u2019t push him, just keeps up his usual constant stream of chatter and waits for him to start jibing back with his usual frequency. When it gets to the point that Eskel trips him into a thigh-high pile of rotting autumn leaves and mulch, it all seems pretty much back to normal \u2013 but then he\u2019s covered in rotting leaves and mulch, so to be honest he probably preferred it before. He says as much, and Eskel just rolls his eyes and keeps on going up the trail.</p>\n<p>On the morning of the sixth day, Jaskier peers out of the bothy to find that the world has turned white overnight. He kicks at a drift of the soft, powdery snow, arms folded. \u201cIsn\u2019t this going to be a problem?\u201d he asks, glancing back at Eskel.</p>\n<p>Eskel shakes his head. \u201cWe\u2019ve done most of the climb,\u201d he says. \u201cFrom here, it\u2019s pretty flat. Shouldn\u2019t be too bad, as long as it\u2019s not too icy \u2013 and given that this is the first serious snow we\u2019ve encountered, it won\u2019t have iced too much yet.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jaskier studies the snow. \u201cHow much further?\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cThree, maybe four more days.\u201d </p>\n<p>Jaskier nods. The cold is seeped into his bones, now, thick and heavy, and he\u2019s glad for the bloody longjohns Eskel made him buy. He wraps himself in as many clothes as he can manage, hood pulled up around his reddened ears and pinked cheeks, and follows in Eskel\u2019s footprints. His lute case is heavy on his back, the boots are heavy around his feet, his head is heavy on his shoulders \u2013 and not that he\u2019s going to say this, no, that would be ungrateful to the extreme given that Eskel\u2019s saved him not once but twice, but, <i>fuck</i>, he\u2019s starting to wish he\u2019d just gone to hide out in Oxenfurt. </p>\n<p>Eskel\u2019s hand lands on his shoulder, shakes him a little. \u201cYou good?\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cFucking brilliant,\u201d Jaskier grinds out through gritted teeth. </p>\n<p>Eskel squeezes his shoulder, and lets go. </p>\n<p>Jaskier doesn\u2019t remember much about those last few days up to the keep. It\u2019s cold, and the path is a mess, and at points he\u2019s so frozen he can\u2019t feel his fingers. He\u2019s pretty sure that Eskel ends up half-carrying him at one point, and he vaguely remembers a conversation that mainly consists of him shouting at Eskel for dragging him up this <i>godsdamned motherfucking arsebackwards bloody wanking mountain</i>, but for the most part, the only thing he really remembers afterwards is the front gate of the keep looming up in front of him, jagged and ragged against the deepening blue of the evening sky. </p>\n<p>\u201cYou made it,\u201d Eskel says, hugging him tight against his side, breath frosting in the clear, cold air. \u201cYou hear me, Jaskier? We\u2019re here.\u201d </p>\n<p>Jaskier\u2019s teeth are chattering so hard he can\u2019t speak. </p>\n<p>Eskel leads him through the winding corridors of Kaer Morhen with the kind of unerring confidence that only comes from living somewhere for the formative years of your life. Jaskier follows behind, feet still a little numb but getting warmer, hands stripped of their gloves and held in front of his mouth, desperately trying to warm them with his breath \u2013 but then Eskel opens a door that leads into a small, surprisingly cosily furnished hall, and all of a sudden Jaskier is just hit by <i>warmth</i>. He makes a little groaning noise in the back of his throat, feels a startling urge to just hurl himself into that <i>roaring fire</i> burning in the grate in front of him \u2013 but comes up short, because the hall isn\u2019t empty. </p>\n<p>\u201cVesemir,\u201d Eskel says, almost as warm as the fire. </p>\n<p>The witcher sitting by the fire can only really be described as <i>grizzled</i>, hair a distinguished salt-and-pepper, skin weathered, eyes bright and wise. He looks up at their entrance, a ghost of a smile crossing his lips at the sight of Eskel \u2013 but then his gaze moves to Jaskier, and he frowns, inhales sharply. Understanding blooms in his eyes, and he shifts his attention back to Eskel. \u201cYou brought Geralt\u2019s bard?\u201d he asks, no greeting, no warmth. </p>\n<p>Jaskier\u2019s too tired to protest at this point. </p>\n<p>Eskel explains the situation to Vesemir as Jaskier slumps down in front of the fire, closing his eyes as he bathes in the seeping, blazing warmth. His skin prickles with something close to pain as blood rushes back to his extremities, tingling his fingers and toes, sparking in his cheeks and the tip of his nose, and to be honest he doesn\u2019t care if this Vesemir throws him in a bloody dungeon right now, as long as he doesn\u2019t have to go back out into the cold. </p>\n<p>He\u2019s vaguely aware that he\u2019s swaying a little, but there\u2019s a bearskin rug under his knees and a blazing hot fire in front of him so he doesn\u2019t mind if he passes out a little. The world goes deliciously hazy around him and he slumps down further, runs his fingers through the fur, listens to the crackle of the fire and the whisper of voices behind him. He\u2019s so fucking <i>tired</i>, and now here he is, at Kaer Morhen, at the witcher fortress, at Geralt\u2019s home, and all he can think is <i>sleep</i>.</p>\n<p>Jaskier curls up on the bearskin rug in front of the fire, and sleeps.</p>\n<p>Jaskier wakes in a sparsely-furnished bedroom, curled up under a mound of blankets and furs with the distinctive smell of honeyed porridge wafting through the air around him. He doesn\u2019t move for a long time, slowly feeling out the soreness in his limbs, the chapped dryness of his lips, the greasiness of his hair, then eventually sneaks an arm out from his nest of warmth to grab for the bowl of lukewarm porridge that\u2019s been left next to the bed. He eats ravenously, his stomach already clamouring for more by the time the bowl is empty, then pushes himself up into a sitting position, groaning at the ache in his limbs as he does so, and studies the bedroom. It\u2019s small, plain stone with an ochre-coloured tapestry stretched along one wall, a rough wooden table against another with a couple of empty shelves above it. His bag and lute case are stacked in one corner, his boots and his shoes lined up next to the door. </p>\n<p>Jaskier just sits there for a moment, fingers pushed into the fur thrown across his legs, and for the first time wonders what exactly he\u2019s got himself into now. </p>\n<p>When he leaves his room, fur-lined cloak wrapped tight around his shoulders and hair raked into as much of a presentable mess as it can be, the corridors of Kaer Morhen are quiet and empty. When he glimpses the sky outside through a small window, it\u2019s dark \u2013 but he has no idea what time it is, whether it\u2019s early morning, late at night, whether he\u2019s slept only a few hours or if he\u2019s slept the whole day through. He also very quickly gets lost, wandering around the echoing stone corridors with little to no idea where he is or how to get back to the bedroom he woke up in, and he\u2019s starting to get frustrated and more than a little worried when he rounds a corner and comes face to face with another witcher he doesn\u2019t recognise. </p>\n<p>Jaskier stops in his tracks, fixed in place by familiar yellow-gold eyes in an unfamiliar face. \u201cUh, hi?\u201d he says, voice a little hoarse, a little strangled. </p>\n<p>The stranger laughs in the back of his throat. \u201cJaskier, right?\u201d he says, voice a deeply satisfying bass that rumbles in Jaskier\u2019s bones. His cheekbones are sharp, the line of his jaw is slanting and strong. There\u2019s a scar traced across one eye, and his hair is dark, cropped close to his head. </p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s me,\u201d Jaskier answers, trying for bright and cheery. \u201cAnd thanks for not going straight for <i>Geralt\u2019s bard</i>, like everyone else.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cFrom what Eskel told me, Geralt\u2019s fucked up enough that he\u2019s lost his claim on you,\u201d the stranger says, head tilted, gaze almost\u2026 assessing? Curious? Intrigued? Jaskier isn\u2019t sure what the right word is, but he\u2019s saved from having to figure it out. \u201cI\u2019m Lambert,\u201d the stranger says, interrupting his train of thought. \u201cAnd I\u2019m guessing you\u2019re lost?\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cNot sure I\u2019d use the word \u2018lost\u2019,\u201d Jaskier says, smiling as brightly as he can. \u201c \u2018Turned around\u2019, maybe. \u2018Confused\u2019.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLost,\u201d Lambert repeats, laughter dancing in his eyes. \u201cHungry?\u201d </p>\n<p>Jaskier\u2019s stomach growls its answer. \u201cVery,\u201d he answers, and follows Lambert down the corridor. \u201cAh, don\u2019t suppose you know how long I was asleep for?\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cA day or so,\u201d Lambert answers. \u201cI was about half a day behind you and Eskel, got here about midday. You\u2019ve been asleep since last night, apparently.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cSo it\u2019s tomorrow night?\u201d</p>\n<p>Lambert glances at him sideways. \u201cYou could say that.\u201d </p>\n<p>Jaskier nods. \u201cAnd I\u2019m assuming I\u2019m not getting kicked out yet?\u201d he asks, voice squeaking a little too high because, well, he\u2019s still half-convinced that that grizzled old witcher is going to grab him by the ear and toss him back out into the snow. </p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re good,\u201d Lambert answers. \u201cEskel\u2019s vouched for you, and for the danger you\u2019re in. Plus, you\u2019d probably die trying to get out of the mountains.\u201d </p>\n<p>Jaskier smiles, a little wan. \u201cI\u2019ve stumbled my way down a hostile mountain before,\u201d he says, pressing the hurt and the heartbreak down as far as he can. Dull pain sits cold in his gut, as ever. \u201cNot going to lie, I\u2019m glad I don\u2019t have to do it again.\u201d </p>\n<p>Lambert\u2019s looking at him again, an expression caught across his scarred features that Jaskier still can\u2019t identify. \u201cIn here,\u201d is all he says, though, and pushes open the same door that Eskel lead him to yesterday. The hall is pretty much how he remembers, although the outlines are a little more solid today \u2013 probably because he\u2019s actually managed to get some decent sleep that isn\u2019t in a freezing cold bothy on the side of a damn mountain. Eskel glances up as they come in, raises a hand in greeting, and Vesemir\u2019s sitting at the head of the table, expression inscrutable, so Jaskier should probably say something to him, a greeting, flattery, <i>something</i> \u2013 but there\u2019s a pot of stew and a couple of loaves of fresh-baked bread sitting on the table and, fuck, the <i>smell</i>. </p>\n<p>Jaskier slides onto the bench next to Eskel, grabs a bowl, serves himself, and eats. </p>\n<p>Lambert laughs, settling across the table from them. \u201cThe bard got lost,\u201d he says. \u201cFound him wandering around near the armoury. We\u2019re gonna have to put a leash on him or something.\u201d </p>\n<p>Jaskier should object to that, but his mouth is currently full of mutton so he just makes an incoherently offended noise. </p>\n<p>\u201cKeep your weird fetishes to yourself, Lambert,\u201d Eskel says lazily, mopping up the remnants of his stew with a hunk of bread. He glances at Jaskier. \u201cI\u2019ll show you around tomorrow,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s not the easiest place to get around, but we\u2019ll do what we can. We can draw you a map or something.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Vesemir says, his voice as gravelly and deep as his exterior suggests. Jaskier eyes him, trying not to look too suspicious, but there\u2019s no aggression in his eyes. \u201cI\u2019ll show the bard what he needs to see. You two need to see to the eastern curtain wall: there\u2019s some storm damage that\u2019s too severe for me to fix alone. We\u2019ll need it patched up before the blizzards set in.\u201d </p>\n<p>Lambert glances up. \u201cI thought Co\u00ebn and Eskel fixed the eastern wall last winter?\u201d he asks. </p>\n<p>\u201cThey did,\u201d Vesemir agrees.</p>\n<p>Lambert shoots Eskel a wicked look. \u201cClearly not very well.\u201d </p>\n<p>Eskel rolls his eyes. \u201cWe fixed the damage,\u201d he says flatly, \u201cbut the wall\u2019s, what, centuries old? And designed to be maintained by hundreds of witchers, not\u2026 well, four.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cExcuses, excuses\u2026\u201d </p>\n<p>Eskel throws a morsel of bread across the table and it bounces off Lambert\u2019s head. </p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be expected to help out, bard,\u201d Vesemir says, apparently quite content to ignore the fact that there\u2019s a minor food fight brewing in front of him. \u201cThere\u2019s no room for dead weight at Kaer Morhen in the winter.\u201d Jaskier\u2019s heart twists a little in his chest, but Vesemir\u2019s expression is oddly\u2026 kindly? \u201cBut I do appreciate that you are human,\u201d he says, the wrinkles deep around his golden eyes. \u201cI won\u2019t ask you to rebuild the eastern wall \u2013 although perhaps Lambert and Eskel could benefit from your intelligence.\u201d </p>\n<p>Jaskier can\u2019t help but snort a laugh. There are identical offended expressions on Lambert and Eskel\u2019s faces, and he says, \u201cIt\u2019s good to know that there\u2019s at least one witcher here who can appreciate quality when he sees it.\u201d </p>\n<p>Vesemir raises an eyebrow. \u201cDon\u2019t get ahead of yourself, bard,\u201d he says wryly. \u201cShow me how well you can muck out a stable and then I\u2019ll judge your quality.\u201d </p>\n<p>Jaskier wrinkles his nose, and Eskel barks a laugh. \u201cGood luck with that, Vesemir,\u201d he says. \u201cHe stepped in a bear\u2019s shit on the way up the mountain and complained about it for two days.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jaskier jabs him with his spoon. \u201cHey! I saved your <i>life</i>.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cAnd I stopped you getting kidnapped <i>twice</i>,\u201d Eskel points out. \u201cI figure that makes us just about even.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not <i>my</i> fault I was getting kidnapped!\u201d Jaskier protests. </p>\n<p>\u201cI mean, if you hadn\u2019t gone to shag that guy in the stables, you would have been safe the second time,\u201d Eskel points out, grabbing another piece of bread and smearing it with butter. \u201cI get that the whole kidnapping situation is ultimately Geralt\u2019s fault, but you could have done a <i>little</i> more to keep yourself out of harm\u2019s way.\u201d </p>\n<p>Jaskier shrugs. \u201cI was coming to spend the winter at a witcher fortress,\u201d he says lightly. \u201cFigured I\u2019d need one last roll in the hay before a season of celibacy. Not like there\u2019s going to be much by way of anonymous encounters up in the mountains.\u201d \u2013 and if the thought of Geralt crosses his mind at that, well, he puts it to one side. </p>\n<p>Eskel rolls his eyes. \u201cYeah, but did you need to take the whole <i>roll in the hay </i>thing so literally?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHay can be comfy.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cDo you regularly fuck strangers in stables?\u201d Lambert asks, a lick of amusement in his voice. </p>\n<p>\u201cOnly when the occasion calls for it,\u201d Jaskier answers, a little snooty. </p>\n<p>\u201cEnough,\u201d Vesemir says, only a little long-suffering. \u201cI don\u2019t want to hear about any of you fucking strangers in stables.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cTechnically, Jaskier\u2019s the only one who we know for sure has fucked a stranger in a stable,\u201d Lambert points out. </p>\n<p>Jaskier takes Eskel\u2019s lead and throws a lump of crust across the table at him. Lambert catches it out of the air before it hits him then pops it into his mouth, holding Jaskier\u2019s gaze as he does so. There\u2019s something in his eyes that Jaskier doesn\u2019t expect, something almost <i>heated</i> \u2013 and Jaskier doesn\u2019t know if it\u2019s because he hasn\u2019t had sex in way too long, if it\u2019s because he\u2019s tired and fractious and on edge, if it\u2019s because he\u2019s wanted golden eyes to look at him with hunger and lust for so many fucking years now, but an answering warmth kindles in his belly. </p>\n<p>He looks away, hands suddenly unsteady. </p>\n<p>Eskel walks him back to his room after they\u2019ve eaten, and Jaskier doesn\u2019t expect to be particularly sleepy given that he\u2019s apparently just slept for a full day but he\u2019s yawning already. \u201cBreakfast will be in the small hall in the morning,\u201d Eskel says, arms folded, pausing outside a door that Jaskier vaguely recognises. \u201cWant me to grab you on the way? Or do you think you can find your way there?\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cShould be able to find my way,\u201d Jaskier says, flashing him a tired smile. \u201cIf I can navigate from Kaedwen to Novigrad without a map, I can probably figure out where to go in a draughty old witcher keep to get food.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cYou are good at following your nose,\u201d Eskel agrees. \u201cAlright. Vesemir will probably come looking for you if you get too lost, so, you know. Maybe wear a bell.\u201d </p>\n<p>Jaskier laughs. \u201cLambert wants to put a leash on me, you want me to wear a bell\u2026\u201d He shakes his head. \u201cI\u2019m learning things about witchers that I never really wanted to know.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cWe both know you did,\u201d Eskel says, light and teasing, but it hits harder than Jaskier expects. His smile slips, and he looks away. Eskel pauses, just for a second, then says, quieter, \u201cBe careful, Jaskier.\u201d </p>\n<p>Jaskier cocks his head. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d </p>\n<p>Eskel gives him a sharp look. \u201cDon\u2019t play the fool with me,\u201d he says. \u201cFirstly, I have <i>eyes</i>. Lambert wasn\u2019t exactly subtle: he was looking at you across the table like you were\u2026 a piece of <i>meat</i>. Secondly, I\u2019m a witcher, Jaskier \u2013 enhanced senses, remember? Your heart sped up, your pupils dilated, and I\u2019m pretty sure I <i>smelled</i> you getting half-hard in your trousers.\u201d His nose wrinkles. \u201cNot something I particularly want to smell again, if I\u2019m honest.\u201d </p>\n<p>Jaskier flushes. \u201cAre you going somewhere with this?\u201d he says, crossing his arms defensively. </p>\n<p>Eskel sighs. \u201cI\u2019m just asking you to be careful,\u201d he says. \u201cLambert is my brother, yeah, but he\u2019s not exactly the\u2026 romantic type. He doesn\u2019t want to wine and dine you, bard. What he wants\u2026\u201d He trails off, sighs again. \u201cIt starts with \u2018f\u2019 and rhymes with what Vesemir wants you to do to the stables.\u201d </p>\n<p>Jaskier feels a slow smile spreading across his face. \u201cYou\u2019re <i>worried</i> about me,\u201d he says, almost wondering. \u201cYou are, aren\u2019t you? You don\u2019t want me to get hurt.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cGeralt\u2019s already fucked you over once,\u201d Eskel says flatly. \u201cAnd you start smelling all bitter and sour when you think about him, so forgive me if I don\u2019t want to have to spend all winter with you smelling like that around <i>Lambert</i> as well.\u201d </p>\n<p>Jaskier presses his lips tight, glances down at the floor. \u201cYou do realise that once Geralt gets here, you\u2019re probably going to be smelling that pretty often anyway?\u201d he says softly. </p>\n<p>Eskel huffs out a sharp breath through his nose. \u201cYeah,\u201d he says. \u201cYeah, I figured. But I also figured that I can just beat the shit out of Geralt to make myself feel better. I\u2019d rather not have to beat up <i>two</i> of my brothers.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jaskier laughs quietly. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, Eskel,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m not about to go falling in love with Lambert.\u201d His lips twist. \u201cI think that boat has\u2026 pretty conclusively sailed for me.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cFuck, Jaskier\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>Jaskier forces a smile, reaches out and squeezes Eskel\u2019s shoulder. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to worry about me,\u201d he says. \u201cI appreciate that you <i>do</i>, but you don\u2019t need to. You witchers might be the experts in monsters and mayhem, but I\u2019m a dab hand at dealing with a broken heart.\u201d </p>\n<p>Eskel sighs. \u201cI knew I shouldn\u2019t have brought a bard to Kaer Morhen,\u201d he mutters. \u201cYou\u2019re really fucking with the equilibrium of the place.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cYou can blame Geralt for that one,\u201d Jaskier says, and smiles despite the sudden stab of pain in his heart. </p>\n<p>Eskel studies him flatly. \u201cJust\u2026 be careful,\u201d he says again, after a moment. \u201cAnd please don\u2019t make me hate <i>another</i> one of my brothers.\u201d </p>\n<p>Jaskier frowns. \u201cYou don\u2019t hate Geralt, Eskel.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMaybe not,\u201d Eskel mutters. \u201cBut I do want to smack him around the head.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t we all,\u201d Jaskier says, bright and cheery. \u201cI\u2019ll see you tomorrow, Eskel.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cNight, Jaskier,\u201d Eskel says, and leaves him to it. </p>\n<p>Jaskier clambers back into the pile of blankets and furs that he only left a few hours ago, nestles himself into the softness and the warmth, and closes his eyes. He doesn\u2019t sleep for a long while, despite his tiredness, just lies there in relative comfort breathing soft and slow, thinking about the spark in Lambert\u2019s eyes and the fury in Geralt\u2019s the last time he saw him. </p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jaskier manages to find his way to the small hall without too much incident in the morning. Breakfast is more of the honeyed porridge he woke up to yesterday, and it\u2019s even better when he\u2019s alert enough to actually taste it. He groans and moans as he makes his way through a second bowl, forgetting that these particular witchers aren\u2019t entirely familiar with his specific brand of theatrics, and then looks up to find all three of them staring at him with varying levels of surprise in their identical golden eyes. </p>\n<p>\u201cSorry,\u201d he mutters around his last mouthful, and washes the whole thing down with a glass of milk. </p>\n<p>If he\u2019s being honest with himself, the look in Lambert\u2019s eyes is actually less surprise and more, well, <i>anticipation</i>, but Jaskier\u2019s not going to think about the implications of that. </p>\n<p>Vesemir holds true to his promise and spends the morning showing him the keep. The halls, the armoury, the kitchens, the library\u2014oh, Jaskier\u2019s eyes practically bulge out of his <i>head</i> when he sees the library\u2014the training ground, the bedchambers, the bathhouse\u2014<i>the bathhouse!</i>\u2014the stables, the granary, the storage rooms, and round and round and round, more and more that he tries desperately and unsuccessfully to cram into his head. </p>\n<p>Vesemir laughs at his astonishment. \u201cThis keep is the product of a millennia of witchers,\u201d he says. \u201cYou can\u2019t expect to learn its ways in a morning, bard.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cI can try,\u201d Jaskier remarks, but he knows he\u2019s out of his depth.</p>\n<p>\u201cKeep to the area around the small hall and the training ground,\u201d Vesemir says. \u201cThat\u2019s where we\u2019ll spend most of our time \u2013 the bedrooms are all in that area, too. If you\u2019re confident finding some of the more out of the way areas, the library, the bathhouse, you\u2019re welcome to use them \u2013 but be warned that you may get lost, and there might not be anyone around to help you find your way.\u201d </p>\n<p>Jaskier wants to say something about how right now, he\u2019d be happy to literally never be found again in these meandering halls if it meant he could wash his fucking hair, but he figures that\u2019s probably not the kind of thing Vesemir wants to hear, so he just nods. \u201cI understand.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGood,\u201d Vesemir says, his eyes bright like he knows exactly what Jaskier\u2019s not telling him. \u201cCome with me.\u201d </p>\n<p>Vesemir takes him to the eastern curtain wall, where Eskel and Lambert are already toiling away, clearing debris away from the sizeable gap that\u2019s been knocked in the old stones by the trunk of a thirty metre high pine tree. Jaskier blinks at the scope of the damage, waves briefly to the other witchers, then follows Vesemir up the narrow flight of stairs that leads to the top of the wall. \u201cHow long will it take them to fix this?\u201d he asks on the way up, keeping one hand against the wall for balance. </p>\n<p>\u201cA few days at least,\u201d Vesemir answers. \u201cIt\u2019ll be quicker once the others arrive.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cHow many others will come?\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cMost likely only two more,\u201d Vesemir answers. \u201cCo\u00ebn, and Geralt, of course.\u201d </p>\n<p>Jaskier ignores the pull in his heart at Geralt\u2019s name, and just nods. \u201cYou said it was a storm that did that?\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cI did,\u201d Vesemir says, reaching the top of the wall. He turns around, offers Jaskier a hand for the last few feet where the steps are worn smooth as glass \u2013 and hauls him up alongside him. \u201cNow hush, bard. I know you like to talk, but there are places where talking isn\u2019t necessary.\u201d </p>\n<p>Jaskier would usually vehemently disagree with that statement, but all of a sudden his words are stolen away.</p>\n<p>The eastern curtain wall stands at the head of a long, snowy glen, nestled in the heart of the mountains all around. It\u2019s a cold, clear day, the sky blue over last night\u2019s heavy snowfall, and for a long, long moment Jaskier just stands there, looking out over the world, the pine forests, the loch gleaming through the distant trees, the winding mountain trails that pick their way through the landscape. The mountains rear high on either side, purple-headed, wreathed in snow, and it\u2019s quiet, so quiet, broken only by the call of the kites circling overhead and the dull grinding of stone down below. </p>\n<p>Jaskier can\u2019t quite breathe. </p>\n<p>\u201cI want you to understand what this place is, bard,\u201d Vesemir says softly. \u201cKaer Morhen is not just a place for witchers to spend the winter, to throw food at each other in the small hall and bicker over imagined slights \u2013 although I warn you, there will be a lot of that. Kaer Morhen is\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSanctuary,\u201d Jaskier interrupts, gaze still fixed on the sheer beauty of the vista sprawled out before him. \u201cSafety. A moment to catch your breath and just\u2026 exist.\u201d </p>\n<p>Vesemir hums. \u201cAh, you <i>are</i> a poet.\u201d </p>\n<p>Jaskier licks his lips. \u201cWould you allow me to sing of this place?\u201d he asks, his voice oddly hoarse. \u201cI understand that that might not be appropriate, and of course I\u2019ll hold my tongue if that\u2019s what you wish, my lord witcher, but it would be my genuine honour to sing of\u2026 <i>this</i>.\u201d He gestures broadly, encompassing the landscape, the keep, the witchers below, the home behind them, all of it. </p>\n<p>Vesemir studies him. \u201cWrite your songs, bard,\u201d he says. \u201cBut only sing them here.\u201d </p>\n<p>Jaskier nods. \u201cThank you,\u201d he says, his fingers itching for his lute. \u201c<i>Thank you</i>.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cYou are a strange one,\u201d Vesemir says, an amused slant to his lips. </p>\n<p>Jaskier shrugs. \u201cIt\u2019s been said,\u201d he answers, still not quite able to take his eyes off the glen that rolls out from beneath his feet. \u201cCan I stay here for a while?\u201d </p>\n<p>Vesemir\u2019s hand lands on his shoulder, squeezes briefly. \u201cYou can come back later,\u201d he says, a little firmer. \u201cFor now, there are other things I need to show you.\u201d </p>\n<p>The yearning that settles deep in Jaskier\u2019s chest is almost strong enough to make him forget the pain in his heart. He goes with Vesemir, learns the rest of the ways of the keep, gets shown how to muck out a stable, mucks out a stable very badly under Vesemir\u2019s unimpressed gaze, but when the day is done, when Vesemir lets him go with an hour or so to go before the evening meal, he goes to his room, grabs his lute, and goes straight to the eastern curtain wall. Eskel and Lambert have disappeared so the world is dead silent, now, only the whisper of the wind and the creak of the old stones \u2013 and Jaskier clambers up to the top of the wall, sits on the edge, boots dangling off into the sheer drop below, and watches. </p>\n<p>He watches the sun sink below the horizon, painting the clear sky in golds and oranges and reds and pinks, warm colours that slowly slide into the inky velvet blue of night. He watches the stars come out, pinpricks of brightness in the dark, and then the moon rises into the heavens, shining white, casting its eerie glow across the glens and the mountaintops below. There\u2019s a peculiar shine to the world, Jaskier sees with eyes that are somehow wet with tears, a glimmer that the moon casts across the snow, the trees, the water of the loch, and he sits there with his lute in his lap, fingers unmoving, and lets the mountains fill him with their splendour.</p>\n<p>The wind whispers gently against the taught strings, teasing a quietly musical rustle out into the night. </p>\n<p>The moon is high in the sky when he hears soft footsteps behind him. He glances back over his shoulder, sees Eskel climbing up the narrow stairs with inimitable witcher grace, a bowl in one hand and a tankard in the other. He takes a seat next to Jaskier, offers him the bowl which is full of some kind of pottage, thick and hearty. \u201cYou missed dinner,\u201d he says, eyebrow raised. </p>\n<p>Jaskier realises that he must have been up here for much, much longer than he intended. \u201cAh, bollocks,\u201d he says, suddenly feeling the gnaw of hunger in his stomach. He slings his lute onto his back and accepts the bowl. \u201cSorry. Time must have got away from me.\u201d </p>\n<p>Eskel hums and looks out across the glen below them. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it,\u201d he says. \u201cVesemir knew where you were, said we\u2019d leave you to it.\u201d He pauses, then bumps his shoulder lightly against Jaskier\u2019s. \u201cI think Lambert missed having someone to ogle, though.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jaskier snorts as he spoons down the pottage. \u201cI\u2019m sure he\u2019ll survive,\u201d he says, taking the tankard out of Eskel\u2019s hand and drinking a mouthful. \u201cBesides, if he wants to bed me, he\u2019ll have to work for it.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cFuck\u2019s <i>sake</i>, Jaskier.\u201d </p>\n<p>Jaskier shrugs. \u201cYou were the one who brought it up.\u201d </p>\n<p>They sit in silence for a while as Jaskier eats, Eskel taking the occasional sip of his ale, the wind still humming its whisper across the exposed strings of his lute. It\u2019s companionable, it\u2019s easy, and it twists Jaskier\u2019s heart in his chest. He pauses halfway through the bowl, lowers it to his lap, and feels tears sting at the back of his eyes, blurring his vision, just a little. </p>\n<p>\u201cJaskier?\u201d Eskel asks quietly. </p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t be offended by this,\u201d Jaskier says, barely more than a whisper, \u201cbut I really fucking wish you weren\u2019t the one who brought me here.\u201d </p>\n<p>Eskel\u2019s head dips. \u201cGeralt.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cGeralt of fucking Rivia,\u201d Jaskier sighs, shaking his head. \u201cI pine after the man for twenty godsdamned years. He breaks my godsdamned heart. And then I run into <i>you</i>, you bastard, and you\u2019re noble and friendly and you can <i>hold a conversation</i> and you aren\u2019t afraid to give a shit about me \u2013 and you bring me <i>here</i>, to <i>this</i>.\u201d There are tears on his cheeks, now, freezing in the frozen air. \u201cAnd all I can fucking think is how I wish you were <i>him</i>.\u201d </p>\n<p>Eskel\u2019s quiet for a moment. \u201cTalk to him,\u201d he says eventually. \u201cWhen he gets here, and he will, talk to him, Jaskier.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd say what, exactly?\u201d Jaskier scoffs. \u201cHe made his feelings <i>perfectly</i> clear on the matter.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cYou don\u2019t lose anything by talking to him.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s very true,\u201d Jaskier agrees, feverbright. \u201cHe\u2019s already taken everything, anyway.\u201d </p>\n<p>Eskel sighs. \u201cFuck,\u201d he says, resigned. \u201cHe really did a number on you, didn\u2019t he?\u201d </p>\n<p>Jaskier wipes his eyes with his sleeve, doing his best to ignore the tremble in his fingers. \u201cUnfortunately, yes.\u201d </p>\n<p>Eskel slings his arm around Jaskier\u2019s shoulders, careful to avoid his lute, and pulls him into the side of his chest. \u201cEat the pottage,\u201d he says, rough around the edges but still achingly kind. \u201cI\u2019d like to be able to say it\u2019s magical pottage that\u2019ll fix everything, but that would be a lie. It\u2019s food, though, and you haven\u2019t eaten properly since midday. Food will help.\u201d </p>\n<p>Jaskier looks down at the bowl in his lap, and does as he\u2019s told. It\u2019s not as good as yesterday\u2019s stew but it\u2019s still more than edible, and Eskel\u2019s right. It helps, and when he\u2019s finished it he puts the bowl to one side, finishes the ale, then folds his hands in his lap and sighs. \u201cSorry,\u201d he says. \u201cYou didn\u2019t sign up for all the dramatics.\u201d</p>\n<p>Eskel hums. \u201cI knew what I was signing up for when I decided to make friends with a bard,\u201d he says wryly, his arm still heavy around Jaskier\u2019s shoulders. \u201cAnd you\u2019re really not that bad, Jaskier. You haven\u2019t threatened to throw yourself off the wall yet.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cDo you want me to threaten to throw myself off the wall?\u201d</p>\n<p>Eskel barks a laugh. \u201cNot really,\u201d he says. \u201cNow come on. You haven\u2019t actually washed since you got here, have you? Let\u2019s get you a bath, and then get you to bed \u2013 <i>without</i> Lambert.\u201d Jaskier laughs, the sound a little wet. \u201cYou\u2019ll feel better in the morning.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jaskier looks out at the moonlight mountains one last time, feels the serenity of the landscape soothe the gaping wound in his heart, and sighs. \u201cA bath does sound good,\u201d he says, and tugs at a stray lock of his hair. \u201cWill you wash my hair for me?\u201d</p>\n<p>Eskel snorts. \u201cWash your own fucking hair, bard,\u201d he says, unhooking his arm from around Jaskier\u2019s shoulders. \u201cI\u2019m not your damn manservant.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cPity,\u201d Jaskier sighs. \u201cYou\u2019d make a very dashing manservant.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cFuck off.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cDraw me a bath and I will.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cI will push you off this mountain.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cVesemir would yell at you if you did.\u201d </p>\n<p>Eskel rolls his eyes. \u201cI regret ever meeting you,\u201d he says, warm with affection. </p>\n<p>\u201cNo, you don\u2019t,\u201d Jaskier says faux-brightly. \u201cI\u2019m a <i>delight</i>.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The days settle into a routine surprisingly quickly. The witchers spend most of their time hard at work repairing the eastern wall, and Jaskier does the menial tasks around the keep that Vesemir tosses to him: taking care of the horses, preparing meals, sweeping the dirt and dust out of disused rooms, a dozen other tiny tasks that fill up his days and keep him busy. He comes up to the eastern wall most nights after the work has finished for the day, sits at the top and plucks a new song from the strings of his lute, mumbling words under his breath, testing out rhythms and rhymes, and it\u2019s taking shape but it\u2019s still nowhere near good enough. Eskel joins him sometimes, shares an ale and some good humoured conversation, and Vesemir spends an hour or so with him one evening, standing beside him in silence, the Old Wolf in his mountain fortress. </p>\n<p>Jaskier writes a whole new verse about <i>that</i>. </p>\n<p>And then there\u2019s Lambert, of course, who looks at Jaskier with interest in his eyes and only gets bolder with every passing day. He sits next to him at meals, thigh pressed hard and muscled against Jaskier\u2019s, cracks dirty jokes that somehow aren\u2019t quite jokes, squeezes his shoulder with a light in his eyes that\u2019s just the wrong side of comradely. It\u2019s not disrespectful, no, and if Jaskier\u2019s being honest with himself, the attention isn\u2019t unwanted. It\u2019s just\u2026 strange, to be so obviously wanted like that by a witcher. It\u2019s not what he\u2019s used to. </p>\n<p>Eskel just rolls his eyes and keeps on throwing bread at Lambert across the table. </p>\n<p>The fourth witcher arrives a few days later, appearing out of the dimness of a swirling snowstorm like something out of a fairytale. Jaskier\u2019s with the horses when he arrives, feeding Llwyd slices of dried apples that he snuck out of the pantry, and he watches as this new arrival\u2014Co\u00ebn, he\u2019s assuming\u2014dismounts and leads his horse into the stables. He pushes his hood back, eyeing Jaskier with those oh-so-familiar golden eyes, and says, \u201cYou\u2019re Jaskier the bard.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jaskier\u2019s momentarily surprised. \u201cI am,\u201d he answers. \u201cAnd I\u2019m assuming you\u2019re Co\u00ebn?\u201d</p>\n<p>Co\u00ebn nods. \u201cI saw you perform at the midsummer festival in Novigrad a few years ago,\u201d he says, pulling off his gloves with his teeth, running long fingers down his mare\u2019s dun nose. Jaskier offers him a slice of apple and he takes it, feeds it to his horse. \u201cYou beat that Marx fella in the final round and he stormed off-stage screaming at you.\u201d </p>\n<p>Jaskier snorts. \u201cValdo likes to cause a scene,\u201d he says. </p>\n<p>\u201cYour music\u2019s good, I like it,\u201d Co\u00ebn says, then cocks his head. \u201cDid Geralt finally get the balls to bring you here for the winter, then?\u201d </p>\n<p>Jaskier\u2019s getting pretty good at hiding his slipping smile whenever Geralt comes up in conversation. \u201cEskel did, actually,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s a whole story.\u201d He holds out his hand. \u201cGive me her reins, I\u2019ll get her settled. You head in, get something to eat. It\u2019s nasty out there.\u201d </p>\n<p>Co\u00ebn nods, still studying him with that peculiar witcher keenness, and hands him the reins. \u201cThanks, bard,\u201d he says, and disappears into the snowy wildness of Kaer Morhen. </p>\n<p>Jaskier stands there for a moment, holding the reins of Co\u00ebn\u2019s horse, and tries not to think about how being called <i>Jaskier the bard</i> instead of <i>Geralt\u2019s bard</i> is simultaneously a relief and somehow a disappointment. </p>\n<p>Co\u00ebn, as it turns out, is surprisingly interested in music, and one night a few days after his arrival Jaskier ends up having a lengthy conversation with him over dinner about the importance of comparative historiography in songwriting. Vesemir interjects occasionally on a finer point of mythology or creature biology, and somehow the three of them end up taking an after-dinner trip to the library to go through some of the older witcher texts in search of parallels for the monsters described in an obscure Kaedwenian ballad that Jaskier learned one term at Oxenfurt. It\u2019s particularly pertinent because the ballad\u2019s proem states quite definitively that it was written after an encounter with a witcher who Vesemir has actually heard of, but the monster in question doesn\u2019t sound like anything either Vesemir or Co\u00ebn have come across before. </p>\n<p>\u201cBut then again,\u201d Vesemir says, frowning, \u201cit\u2019s an old ballad, and mutation and adaptation have wreaked havoc with the older creatures\u2019 bloodlines.\u201d </p>\n<p>Eskel and Lambert just stare at them like they\u2019re mad, then announce that they\u2019re going to stay in the small hall and get drunk to celebrate the end of the construction work on the eastern wall. </p>\n<p>After a really pretty interesting hour or so in the library, poring over dusty old books and getting precisely nowhere in their inquiries but having a fascinating time doing so, Vesemir sits back and announces that that\u2019s probably enough history for one night. \u201cGo join the others in their celebrations,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ll see you both in the morning.\u201d </p>\n<p>Co\u00ebn laughs. \u201cThey\u2019re probably both already pissed by now,\u201d he says, then flashes Jaskier a smile. \u201cWant to go see how much witchers can drink, bard? That\u2019ll be another song for you.\u201d </p>\n<p>They tread the corridors of the keep together, engrossed in companionable conversation about the annual midsummer festival in Novigrad and the rise and fall of Valdo Marx. When they get back to the small hall, the stink of alcohol hits Jaskier the moment they open the door. He wrinkles his nose, says, \u201cWhat is <i>that</i>?\u201d, but doesn\u2019t have much of a chance to get his bearings because a glass of something that burns his throat like <i>dragonfire</i> is being shoved into his hand and, well, it looks like he\u2019s got some catching up to do. </p>\n<p>Jaskier gets drunk with a bunch of witchers, which, in retrospect, was never going to end well. </p>\n<p>Somewhere between that first glass of what he thinks is supposed to be vodka and the moment that Eskel upends the bottle over his mouth and nothing comes out, Co\u00ebn loses his shirt to the fire, Lambert breaks a bench by sitting on it, and Jaskier manages to persuade Eskel to let him braid his hair. It\u2019s too short to be as satisfying as it would be to braid Geralt\u2019s hair, of course, and Jaskier says as much, but then he points out that Geralt is a fucking idiot who wouldn\u2019t know a good thing if it hit him in the face \u2013 which makes Co\u00ebn snort so hard he sprays vodka out of his nose. Lambert comes and physically separates Jaskier from Eskel eventually, bodily carrying him to the bench next to the fire, sprawling them out together, Jaskier\u2019s leg kicked out across his lap, and he sits with his palm pressed flat and warm to Jaskier\u2019s inner thigh as he continues to argue with Co\u00ebn about the best way to distract a bruxa. </p>\n<p>Eskel sits in an old armchair opposite them, feet propped up on the now-empty barrel of ale they got through with dinner, and meets Jaskier\u2019s gaze, surprisingly coherent given how much he\u2019s drunk. Jaskier knows what the look means\u2014<i>You sure, bard?</i>\u2014and he nods, smiles as soberly he can. </p>\n<p>Lambert laughs at something Co\u00ebn says, sharp and bright, and his fingers squeeze Jaskier\u2019s thigh with a confidence that feels like a promise. </p>\n<p>The braids are unravelling from Eskel\u2019s hair when they run out of vodka, and he sighs, peers into the empty bottle. \u201cMight be time to call it a night,\u201d he slurs, blinking heavier than usual, and hoists himself to his feet. He sways a little, catches himself against Jaskier\u2019s shoulder, then makes a disconcerted noise. \u201cAh, shit, Vesemir\u2019s gonna want us to start drills in the morning, isn\u2019t he?\u201d </p>\n<p>Co\u00ebn barks a laugh. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it,\u201d he says. \u201cAt least you\u2019ll have an excuse for when you lose.\u201d </p>\n<p>Eskel kicks him, but it\u2019s uncoordinated and the blow doesn\u2019t really land. \u201cI\u2019m going to bed,\u201d he says pointedly. \u201cYou should do the same before you end up throwing the rest of your clothes in the fucking fire, Co\u00ebn.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cHe has a point,\u201d Lambert rumbles, golden-yellow eyes bright and dancing in the light of the fire. </p>\n<p>Co\u00ebn grumbles something under his breath but follows Eskel out of the small hall nonetheless, catching himself on the doorframe and cursing at the cold air outside. The last thing Jaskier sees before the door slams shut is Co\u00ebn breaking into a run, making a dash for the warmth of his room as Eskel howls his laughter to the moon \u2013 and then the door\u2019s shut, and it\u2019s just him and Lambert, basking in the heat of the fire. </p>\n<p>Lambert\u2019s fingertips press into the soft flesh of his inner thigh. \u201cI\u2019ve got a bottle of brandy in my room,\u201d he says, head tilted. \u201cIf you want.\u201d </p>\n<p>Jaskier smiles a smile he\u2019s worn a hundred times before, a warm smile, an easy smile, a smile that says <i>yes, please</i> more than his words ever could. \u201cSounds good,\u201d he says, and sees an echoing smile curling Lambert\u2019s lips. </p>\n<p>Lambert\u2019s room is larger than Jaskier\u2019s, scattered with years\u2019 worth of trophies and prizes and memories, skins hanging from the walls, elaborately-woven rugs strewn across the floor. There\u2019s a small cabinet in one corner, carefully carved with a repeating wolf motif, the wood polished to a shine by soft rags and the passage of the years. Lambert retrieves the promised bottle of brandy and two glasses from inside, pours a couple of measures and knocks his own back straightaway. \u201cIt was part of my payment for a job a few years ago,\u201d he says, dangling Jaskier\u2019s glass in his hand. \u201cSome lord who was a lot more hard up than he wanted to admit.\u201d He shrugs. \u201cIt\u2019s good shit.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll be the judge of that,\u201d Jaskier says, eyebrow raised, and reaches for the glass.</p>\n<p>Lambert bats his hand away. \u201cCome here,\u201d he says, voice dropping lower, rougher, and Jaskier feels his heart thudding faster as he obeys. Lambert tilts Jaskier\u2019s head back with his free hand and raises the glass to his mouth, tips the brandy between his lips and catches a stray droplet with the pad of his thumb \u2013 and Jaskier\u2019s fingers flutter to rest around his wrists as he drinks, not stopping, not pausing, just touching because that\u2019s what he wants, that\u2019s what he <i>needs</i>. </p>\n<p>The glass is empty, and Lambert puts it down on the cabinet behind him with a soft clink. </p>\n<p>Jaskier isn\u2019t sure who instigates it but all of a sudden they\u2019re kissing, hard and fierce, Lambert\u2019s tongue in his mouth and Lambert\u2019s arms around his waist, hands big and heavy, tugging him closer. Jaskier\u2019s drunk enough that his balance is a little off, and when Lambert takes a step forward, guiding them back towards the bed, he stumbles over his own feet. Lambert catches him with a laugh, kisses him again, deep and sensual, and his hands feel <i>so fucking good</i> against Jaskier\u2019s overheated skin. \u201cTell me, bard,\u201d he murmurs, nosing against the arch of Jaskier\u2019s throat. \u201cDo you want me to fuck you?\u201d </p>\n<p>Jaskier\u2019s breath stutters in his throat and his gut twists, suddenly painful. </p>\n<p>Lambert stills, pulls back. \u201cJaskier?\u201d he asks, concern trumping lust and alcohol. </p>\n<p>Jaskier can\u2019t quite meet his gaze. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he says, because yeah, okay, he\u2019s drunk and there\u2019s a golden-eyed witcher in his arms asking oh so politely to take him apart and make him scream \u2013 but this isn\u2019t right. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Lambert,\u201d he says again, heart beating so hard it feels like it\u2019s practically vibrating. \u201cI can\u2019t do this. It isn\u2019t fair on you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lambert loosens his grip but doesn\u2019t move away. \u201cWhat isn\u2019t fair on me?\u201d </p>\n<p>Jaskier\u2019s heart hurts. \u201cI don\u2019t want <i>you</i>,\u201d he says bitterly, then pauses, rephrases: \u201cIt\u2019s not that I don\u2019t <i>want</i> you, don\u2019t get me wrong, I\u2019d really quite like you to fuck me senseless right now \u2013 but you\u2019re not the one that I\u2026\u201d He falters, can\u2019t quite bring himself to say the words. </p>\n<p>Lambert\u2019s smile is surprisingly soft. \u201cI don\u2019t need you to love me to spend the night with me,\u201d he says, leans forward slowly enough that Jaskier can back away if he wants to, catches his lips in a kiss. \u201cHell, it\u2019ll make a nice change for <i>both</i> of us to be thinking about someone else during sex.\u201d Jaskier looks at him sharply, surprised, and for the first time sees a ghost of heartbreak in Lambert\u2019s eyes, too. Lambert smiles, brushes a stray tear off Jaskier\u2019s cheek. \u201cIt\u2019s Geralt, isn\u2019t it?\u201d </p>\n<p>Jaskier closes his eyes, nods. </p>\n<p>\u201cI wondered,\u201d Lambert says, tilts Jaskier\u2019s chin up with his fingertips, kisses him slowly, searchingly. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to,\u201d he whispers, pressing kisses to Jaskier\u2019s throat. \u201cJust say the word and I\u2019ll stop, no hard feelings. But all I want is to make you feel good.\u201d He laughs, hoarse and throaty. \u201cAnd to fuck that perfect arse of yours so hard you won\u2019t be able to walk properly tomorrow, but that\u2019s negotiable.\u201d </p>\n<p>Jaskier groans, head falling back. \u201cAre you sure?\u201d he asks, breathless. </p>\n<p>\u201cVery,\u201d Lambert murmurs against the skin of his throat. </p>\n<p>Jaskier brings his hand up, runs his fingertips over Lambert\u2019s close-cropped hair, all of a sudden needing to ask. \u201cWho is it?\u201d </p>\n<p>Lambert pauses, just for a moment, then straightens up and sighs. \u201cNo one you\u2019d know,\u201d he says, his words a whisper against Jaskier\u2019s lips. \u201cAnd the others, they don\u2019t know. So I\u2019d appreciate it if you kept this to yourself.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jaskier kisses him. \u201cOf course,\u201d he whispers, as honest as he can manage, then kisses him again harder, presses closer, feels the hitch in Lambert\u2019s breathing and the slow pound of his heart. \u201cI have to say, I\u2019m interested to see how you plan to fuck me so hard I can\u2019t walk,\u201d he says, breathy and a little drunk, full of the companionship of shared suffering. \u201cI warn you, I\u2019m very resilient.\u201d </p>\n<p>Lambert\u2019s laugh is halfway to a snarl. \u201cYou\u2019ve never been fucked by a witcher before,\u201d he says. \u201cMore to the point, you\u2019ve never been fucked by <i>me</i> before.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cPromises, promises,\u201d Jaskier murmurs, digging his fingernails into Lambert\u2019s shoulders, and kisses him with all the ferocity he can manage. </p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>They gather at the training ground the next morning bright and early, the sun just beginning to top the walls of the keep, painting the old stones in brilliance. Jaskier\u2019s exhausted and hungover, his body sore and, okay, yeah, his gait <i>is</i> a little off \u2013 but at least he doesn\u2019t have to jump and leap and parry under Vesemir\u2019s merciless gaze, no, he gets to sit by the side with a large bowl of porridge and offer helpful commentary. He laughs when Eskel has to take a break to go vomit in the corner, but he offers him a waterskin in recompense so, really, he\u2019s a saint. </p>\n<p>Eskel grabs the skin from him and rinses out his mouth, spits onto the stony ground. \u201cFuck, Jaskier,\u201d he says. \u201cTake a <i>bath</i>. You stink of sex and Lambert, which is <i>not</i> a combination I particularly want to be exposed to.\u201d </p>\n<p>Jaskier shrugs, eats a spoonful of porridge. \u201cAnd miss all this?\u201d he says, gesturing to where a hungover Co\u00ebn has just fallen on his arse for the second time. \u201cNever. I\u2019m going to write a song about witchers who can\u2019t handle their vodka. It\u2019ll be my best composition yet. I can\u2019t just <i>leave</i> because you want me to have a <i>bath</i>.\u201d </p>\n<p>Eskel smacks the back of his head lightly and drops the waterskin in his lap. \u201cJust say that you\u2019re too hungover to move and be done with it.\u201d </p>\n<p>Jaskier waves a finger at him. \u201cIt\u2019s <i>also</i> because my body aches all over from the sex.\u201d </p>\n<p>Eskel groans. \u201c<i>Don\u2019t</i> tell me that.\u201d </p>\n<p>Jaskier stretches out in his seat, bowl of porridge propped on his belly, fur-lined cloak tucked tight and warm around his ears. \u201cThere was <i>a lot</i> of sex,\u201d he says, grinning broadly. \u201cMe and Lambert. All night. <i>Sex</i>.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna throw up again,\u201d Eskel mutters, and goes back to Vesemir\u2019s drills. </p>\n<p>Jaskier doesn\u2019t actually spend the rest of his day sitting there, watching the witchers work off their hangovers. He finishes his porridge then takes his bowl through into the keep\u2019s kitchens, tidies up after the mess of breakfast, then notes that the stock of coal and logs for the fire is running low so takes a trip to one of the outside stores to replenish it. He whiles away the morning like that, rebuilding the fire in the small hall, cleaning the dead leaves out of one of the southerly courtyards, then stops by the training ground again, cloak tossed back over his shoulders. \u201cYou know,\u201d he remarks, as Co\u00ebn pauses to catch his breath, \u201cI\u2019m starting to feel like you witchers think I\u2019m a bloody skivvy or something.\u201d</p>\n<p>Co\u00ebn snorts. \u201cLambert thinks you\u2019re a <i>fuckable</i> skivvy, if that helps.\u201d </p>\n<p>Jaskier rolls his eyes and goes to get something to eat for lunch. </p>\n<p>He goes back to the training ground in the afternoon, perches on a low wall with his lute and strums jaunty tunes as the witchers hone their skills against their brothers, last night\u2019s excesses long since burned away, light and nimble on their feet, their fighting more like dancing in the cool winter light. He doesn\u2019t watch any of them in particular, just absently studying the patterns of their movements like he\u2019d gaze at ripples in a pond, then starts plucking the chords of the song he works on when he sits on the eastern wall, words about fate and sanctuary and hope sitting silent at the back of his tongue. It\u2019s a very particular focus that he gets when he\u2019s composing like this, intense and narrow to the exclusion of pretty much everything else, and he\u2019s deep in that focus, now, his eyes following the witchers\u2019 pirouettes and parries even as his mind is elsewhere, in the pine forests, in the lochs, in the purple mountains and the achingly empty skies. </p>\n<p>That\u2019s probably why he doesn\u2019t notice the footsteps until it\u2019s too late. </p>\n<p>\u201c<i>Geralt!</i>\u201d Co\u00ebn calls, full of warmth and welcome, and Jaskier feels the bottom drop out of his stomach. </p>\n<p>His fingers spasm so tight around the neck of his lute that he hears the wood creak, and he half-notices Eskel\u2019s worried glance in his direction but it\u2019s not exactly what he\u2019s focusing on, no, it\u2019s not what he\u2019s focusing on <i>at all</i> because there he is. Geralt of fucking Rivia, tall and travel-worn, saddlebags thrown over his shoulder, swords on his back, a weary expression creasing his forehead and a young girl\u2019s hand held tight in his. Geralt hasn\u2019t seen him. He\u2019s greeting Co\u00ebn and then Vesemir, introducing them to the girl at his side\u2014ash-blond hair, blazing green eyes, skin so pale it\u2019s barely a shade darker than the snow\u2014and for a panicked second all Jaskier can think is <i>run</i> \u2013 but then Geralt\u2019s gaze moves, slides to Lambert and Eskel, standing a little further away, and then those golden eyes flicker once more and, well, there it is. </p>\n<p>A stunned expression unfurls across Geralt\u2019s face. \u201cWhat the fuck is he doing here?\u201d he snaps, rage and bitterness in his voice \u2013 and any tiny, fleeting hope that Jaskier might have nursed deep in the depths of his heart is abruptly snuffed out like a candle in a hurricane. </p>\n<p>He hears Eskel snap something at Geralt, the words too hazy to make out, but that\u2019s okay, that\u2019s alright. Jaskier gets to his feet slowly, carefully, every movement sort of feeling like it\u2019s something out of a dream, and sets the strap of his lute carefully across his shoulder. He crosses the training ground on light feet, presses a reassuring touch to Eskel\u2019s wrist as he passes, doesn\u2019t look at Geralt, <i>doesn\u2019t look at Geralt</i>, crosses the training ground and goes to one knee in front of the young girl with dirty blond hair and a haunted look in her eyes. \u201cPrincess Cirilla,\u201d he says, quiet and gentle. \u201cDo you remember me?\u201d </p>\n<p>The girl studies him for a moment, tiredness written in the lines of her forehead, and then recognition blooms across her expression. \u201cYou sang at my grandmother\u2019s court,\u201d he says, reaching out to touch the strings of his lute. \u201cYour name is Jaskier.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d Jaskier says, and offers her his hand. \u201cIt\u2019s good to see you again, princess. You must be hungry after that journey. The food\u2019s not exactly fit for royalty here, but it\u2019ll fill you up. Want to come with me and get something to eat?\u201d </p>\n<p>The princess studies him for a moment, then places her hand in his and nods. \u201cCall me Ciri,\u201d she says, that Cintran regality still strong and clear in her voice. </p>\n<p>\u201cCiri,\u201d Jaskier repeats, and nods his respect. His hands aren\u2019t shaking, his hearing is clear and sharp, his voice is smooth. \u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re here, Ciri. Now, tell me: what do you like to eat?\u201d </p>\n<p>Jaskier\u2019s vaguely aware that Eskel\u2019s grabbed Geralt by the arm and pulled him away, that they\u2019re deep in a quiet, angry conversation that he\u2019s choosing not to listen to, but Ciri\u2019s looking at him with those wide green eyes and talking about pears and figs and honeycakes, about roast pork with apple slices and baked cod, and there\u2019s a nostalgia in her voice that breaks his heart. \u201cWell, I don\u2019t know about the honeycakes,\u201d he says, smiling. \u201cI\u2019m not much of a baker. But I know there\u2019s a jar of dried figs in the kitchen that I\u2019ve been meaning to crack open before these witchers can get to it. Sound good?\u201d </p>\n<p>Ciri looks at him, a warm smile starting to curl her lips, and nods. </p>\n<p>Jaskier abruptly realises that he\u2019d let Geralt break his heart a dozen times over just to see that smile again. \u201cCome on, then,\u201d he says, and squeezes her hand. \u201cLet\u2019s go steal some figs.\u201d</p>\n<p>They don\u2019t just steal figs, in the end. They <i>start</i> with the figs, sure, and Ciri digs a handful out of the jar with delight on her face, shoves them into her mouth as fast as she can manage. Jaskier laughs at that to begin with before he realises that, well, she\u2019s probably had to learn to eat fast or lose her food \u2013 and then he just hands her the jar when she\u2019s done, says, \u201cEat as many as you like. They\u2019re not going anywhere.\u201d </p>\n<p>She glances up at him, gaze sharp, then takes one final fig out and eats it, a little slower. </p>\n<p>After the figs, they find the honey that goes into their porridge every morning, eat spoonfuls of that, and then Jaskier grabs a loaf of bread that came out of the oven this morning and they cover it in freshly-churned butter, eating and eating and eating. It\u2019s excessive and probably wasteful\u2014Jaskier imagines he\u2019ll get yelled at for that later\u2014but it makes the little girl with sadness in her eyes smile like the sun, so frankly Jaskier doesn\u2019t give a fuck about the waste. </p>\n<p>Ciri pauses eventually, sucking butter and honey off her fingers, and looks up at Jaskier. They\u2019re sitting on the floor of one of the pantries, surrounded by crumbs that Jaskier will sweep up later so that Vesemir doesn\u2019t start shouting about rats again, and Jaskier doesn\u2019t know where the witchers are, what arguments they\u2019re having, but right now he\u2019s glad that they\u2019ve left them alone. \u201cGeralt\u2019s mentioned you,\u201d she says, a bright birdlike intelligence gleaming in her eyes. </p>\n<p>\u201cDid he now?\u201d Jaskier says, hoping that his smile comes across as amused rather than devastated. \u201cWell, we used to travel together. I\u2019d be offended if he didn\u2019t.\u201d</p>\n<p>Ciri\u2019s still watching him. \u201cHe seemed surprised that you were here.\u201d </p>\n<p>Jaskier snorts. \u201c \u2018Surprised\u2019,\u201d he echoes, smiling a conspiratorial smile. \u201cAh, I\u2019ve missed that talent for understatement that you only get growing up in a royal court.\u201d </p>\n<p>Ciri flushes, just a little. \u201cHe <i>was</i> surprised,\u201d she says, lips twitching at the corners. \u201cHe even used the kind of language he always uses when he\u2019s\u2026 surprised.\u201d </p>\n<p>Jaskier cocks his head. \u201cWhat kind of language is that, exactly?\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201c \u2018Fuck\u2019,\u201d Ciri answers, prim and proper.</p>\n<p>Jaskier snorts. \u201cWhy, Princess Cirilla, you\u2019ve got a <i>mouth</i> on you.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cBlame Geralt,\u201d Ciri says, and swipes another fingerful of honey. Jaskier laughs quietly but can\u2019t quite summon the words to reply, not with that pain still swirling fresh and bloody in his heart, but that\u2019s okay because the princess is still watching him as she sucks the honey off her fingertip, gaze heavy and level. \u201cI haven\u2019t left his side since he found me,\u201d she says eventually. \u201cNot once. I think it\u2019s because he doesn\u2019t trust anyone else enough to be around me without him there.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cSounds like Geralt,\u201d Jaskier says, smiling a lopsided smile. </p>\n<p>Ciri\u2019s eyes are so very bright. \u201cHe let me go with you.\u201d </p>\n<p>Jaskier\u2019s smile falters, and she\u2019s just a girl, she\u2019s just a child, but there\u2019s a depth of wisdom and knowledge in her eyes that he can\u2019t deny. \u201cThis is his home,\u201d he says eventually, hoping that he sounds wistful and romantic rather than, well, destroyed. \u201cHe knows you\u2019re safe here. He knows that there\u2019s nothing and no one here that could hurt you.\u201d </p>\n<p>Ciri\u2019s expression is frozen, her lips tight and thin. She stares at the floor between her feet for a minute, then lets out a long breath, slow and pausing. \u201cMy home,\u201d she starts, then stops before she can continue that thought \u2013 and, oh, shit, there are tears shining bright in her eyes. \u201cMy home is gone,\u201d she says finally. \u201cI saw it burn.\u201d </p>\n<p>Sorrow floods Jaskier\u2019s chest. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry,\u201d he says, barely more than a breath. </p>\n<p>Ciri shrugs with one shoulder, gaze still fixed on the floor. \u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m not the only one who lost something.\u201d </p>\n<p>Jaskier frowns, leans forward. \u201cBut just because you\u2019re not the only one who\u2019s lost something, it doesn\u2019t mean that your loss doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d he says, insistent. \u201cIt\u2019s not a competition, Ciri. There are all different kinds of ways to hurt, and they\u2019re all valid. They\u2019re all important.\u201d </p>\n<p>Ciri looks up at him. \u201cYou\u2019re hurting,\u201d she says with the blunt perceptiveness of a child. \u201cAren\u2019t you? Because of Geralt.\u201d </p>\n<p>Jaskier grits his teeth. \u201cThat\u2019s a different kind of hurt.\u201d </p>\n<p>Ciri nods, as if absorbing this. \u201cBut just because it\u2019s different,\u201d she says slowly, \u201cthat doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s unimportant.\u201d </p>\n<p>The swell of affection in Jaskier\u2019s heart is almost uncontrollable. \u201cYeah, that\u2019s right,\u201d he says, nodding, then pauses. \u201cAnd you know, Ciri, that if you need someone to talk to about\u2026 your home, if you want to talk to someone who isn\u2019t Geralt and who can therefore communicate with you in more than just grunts and the word \u2018fuck\u2019, I\u2019m here.\u201d </p>\n<p>Ciri flashes him a small smile, thankful, grateful. \u201cGeralt says he\u2019s going to train me,\u201d is what she says, though, adopting what Jaskier recognises as a classic Geralt of Rivia technique and changing the subject when it all gets a bit too emotional. \u201cTo be a witcher. To <i>fight</i> like a witcher.\u201d </p>\n<p>Jaskier huffs a laugh. \u201cBetter you than me,\u201d he says dryly. \u201cI\u2019ll watch from the sidelines and compose hexameter epics about your prowess with a sword.\u201d </p>\n<p>Ciri shifts, reaches inside her worn brown cloak, retrieves a dagger. It\u2019s small enough that it doesn\u2019t overwhelm her hand, the blade bright and plain, the handle wrapped with surprisingly attractive red leather. \u201cGeralt gave me this,\u201d she says, holding it out to Jaskier. </p>\n<p>He takes it gingerly, watches Ciri\u2019s gaze follow the little knife. \u201cHave you had to use it?\u201d he asks. </p>\n<p>\u201cNot yet.\u201d </p>\n<p>Jaskier silently hopes that she never has to, but there\u2019s a tension in her shoulders and a brightness in her eyes that tells him that\u2019s not the response she wants. \u201cGeralt is a good teacher,\u201d he says, handing the dagger back. \u201cEven if he is grumpy and tetchy and doesn\u2019t really understand the concept of positive reinforcement. Listen to him, and you can\u2019t go wrong.\u201d </p>\n<p>Ciri returns the dagger to wherever she had it hidden inside her cloak. \u201cI remember you,\u201d she says, studying him. \u201cYou were at the feast for my tenth birthday, and you sang a ballad about the Lion Cub of Cintra.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI wrote it specially for the occasion,\u201d Jaskier says, nodding. \u201cIt was requested by your grandmother\u2019s consort, if I remember correctly.\u201d </p>\n<p>Ciri smiles, just a little. It isn\u2019t a happy smile. \u201cEist sang that song to me for weeks afterward,\u201d she says \u2013 and there it is again, that little painful twist in Jaskier\u2019s heart. \u201cDo you still remember how it goes?\u201d </p>\n<p>Jaskier smiles. \u201cI remember how all my songs go,\u201d he answers. \u201cI can sing it to you sometime, if you want.\u201d </p>\n<p>Ciri nods. \u201cI\u2019d like that.\u201d </p>\n<p>The door to the pantry opens, hinges squeaking softly in the quiet, and Jaskier flinches instinctively, shoulders hunching \u2013 but it\u2019s only Vesemir, Eskel a shadow at his shoulder. The grizzled witcher glances at Jaskier briefly, then looks to Ciri, a gentle smile on his lips. \u201cWe\u2019re sorting out a room for you, princess,\u201d he says. \u201cCome with me.\u201d </p>\n<p>Ciri gets to her feet, offers Jaskier a smile, and says, \u201cThank you.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome,\u201d Jaskier answers, echoing her smile, and doesn\u2019t move. </p>\n<p>Vesemir takes Ciri\u2019s hand and leads her away, talking to her in a soft voice that Jaskier would almost describe as grandfatherly. Eskel steps back to let them pass, then comes into the pantry, closes the door behind him. He eyes the mess of breadcrumbs that Jaskier\u2019s currently sitting in, then takes Ciri\u2019s spot opposite him and sighs. \u201cYou two made a bit of a mess in here.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll clean it up,\u201d Jaskier says flatly. </p>\n<p>Eskel hums. \u201cYou alright?\u201d </p>\n<p>Jaskier sighs. \u201cNot really,\u201d he says, letting his head fall back against the barrel he\u2019s leaning against. \u201cSorry for disappearing with Ciri. It was the only thing I could think to do that didn\u2019t involve just\u2026 running away. Figured she\u2019d be hungry and tired after slogging up that bloody mountain, thought I\u2019d get her to eat something before she did what I did and just passed out in front of the fire. Didn\u2019t anticipate that we\u2019d eat half a jar of figs and most of the honey, but, you know, she\u2019s royalty, she\u2019s used to getting what she\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cJaskier,\u201d Eskel interrupts gently, stopping him mid-ramble. </p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Jaskier says, and lets out a sharp breath. </p>\n<p>\u201cI spoke to Geralt,\u201d Eskel says. \u201cExplained why you\u2019re here. Told him in no uncertain terms that it\u2019s his fucking fault, and if he has a problem with it, he can take it up with me.\u201d </p>\n<p>Jaskier laughs. \u201cDefending my honour?\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cProbably should have stopped you fucking Lambert if I wanted to do that,\u201d Eskel observes wryly. </p>\n<p>\u201cTrue.\u201d </p>\n<p>Eskel\u2019s quiet for a moment. \u201cHe\u2019ll come speak to you at some point,\u201d he says. </p>\n<p>Jaskier rolls his eyes. \u201cWon\u2019t <i>that</i> be a fun conversation.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cI <i>told</i> him to come speak to you,\u201d Eskel says, his voice a little harder. \u201cAnd now I\u2019m going to tell you that, when he does, you\u2019re going to speak to him, too.\u201d He holds up a hand to forestall Jaskier\u2019s protests, yellow-gold eyes flashing a warning. \u201cYou\u2019re <i>going to talk to him</i>, Jaskier, if only because the rest of us are not about to spend the whole godsdamned winter tiptoeing around the pair of you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jaskier eyes him. \u201cI thought you were on my side.\u201d It\u2019s petulant, he knows, but he can\u2019t stop himself.</p>\n<p>Eskel sighs. \u201cI\u2019m on the side of not having a headache until spring,\u201d he says. \u201cGeralt\u2019s an idiot, and he fucked up. He hurt you.\u201d Jaskier opens his mouth to dramatically elaborate on exactly <i>how much</i> Geralt hurt him, but Eskel just rolls his eyes and steamrollers over him: \u201cAnd yes, I know, he didn\u2019t just <i>hurt</i> you, he <i>destroyed</i> you, he broke your heart, he tore you apart and flung you to the wolves, blah blah blah \u2013 I\u2019ve heard your damn songs, Jaskier, you\u2019re not exactly subtle.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jaskier sniffs. \u201cI\u2019ll have you know, I\u2019m praised for my subtlety of touch across the continent.\u201d </p>\n<p>Eskel pulls a face. \u201cI mean, that just sounds like you\u2019re going to start talking about Lambert again,\u201d he says, and Jaskier laughs. \u201cBut honestly, Jaskier, Geralt fucked up. Here\u2019s the big surprise, though \u2013 he <i>knows</i> he fucked up.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cI find that <i>very</i> unlikely.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cHe told me,\u201d Eskel says, and no, no, Jaskier can\u2019t listen to this, he <i>can\u2019t</i>, because he can feel hope already starting to swell in his chest, foolish, idiotic hope. \u201cI was\u2026 pretty pissed, after how he spoke you before. Yelled at him a bit. It was pretty satisfying, to be honest \u2013 which was sort of ruined by how he pretty agreed with everything I said.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jaskier closes his eyes, presses the heels of his hands to his forehead. \u201cEskel\u2026\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cJust let him say his piece,\u201d Eskel says. \u201cThat\u2019s all I\u2019m asking.\u201d </p>\n<p>Jaskier snorts. \u201cIt\u2019ll be three words,\u201d he says, then does a passable imitation of Geralt\u2019s rumble: \u201c \u2018<i>Fuck off, Jaskier</i>\u2019.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, then you can send him back to me and I\u2019ll smack him in the head until he apologises,\u201d Eskel says. \u201cOr get Vesemir to do it, maybe. He can break out the cane again, beat some sense into him like he used to when we were young.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201c<i>That</i> I\u2019d like to see.\u201d </p>\n<p>Eskel\u2019s gaze is level. \u201cSo?\u201d</p>\n<p>Jaskier understands the unasked question. He looks down, studies his hands, sticky with honey and spattered with bread flour. \u201cI\u2019ll listen to whatever he has to say,\u201d he says finally. \u201cAnd then I\u2019ll probably go get spectacularly drunk again, follow your lead and throw up in a corner somewhere.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll drink with you and make sure you don\u2019t throw yourself off the eastern wall,\u201d Eskel says, then wrinkles his nose. \u201cOr into bed with Lambert.\u201d </p>\n<p>Jaskier wags his finger. \u201cYou really ought to try it before you knock it,\u201d he says, mock-serious, unable to fully stop the smile that twitches at the corner of his lips. \u201cLambert\u2019s a very generous lover.\u201d </p>\n<p>Eskel mimes vomiting and kicks Jaskier\u2019s ankle. \u201cIf you tell me any more details about fucking Lambert, I swear to the gods I\u2019ll throw you off the eastern wall myself.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cNo, you won\u2019t,\u201d Jaskier says, laughing. \u201cYou\u2019d miss my sparkling conversation too much.\u201d </p>\n<p>Eskel hums and levers himself to his feet, brushes breadcrumbs off his trousers. \u201cI\u2019m going to spar with the others,\u201d he says. \u201cVesemir said that he\u2019s going to talk to Ciri and Geralt in the library, so, you know, maybe avoid that part of the keep for a while.\u201d He offers Jaskier a hand, pulls him up. \u201cYou should genuinely clean up in here,\u201d he says. \u201cYou know what Vesemir is like about rats.\u201d </p>\n<p>Jaskier nods. \u201cI\u2019ll probably give dinner a miss,\u201d he says. \u201cI ate\u2026 quite a lot of figs.\u201d </p>\n<p>Eskel squeezes his shoulder. \u201cYou know where I\u2019ll be,\u201d he says. \u201cIf you need me.\u201d </p>\n<p>Jaskier nods, all of a sudden not quite able to speak, and flashes Eskel as bright a smile as he can manage. </p>\n<p>It doesn\u2019t take him long to clean up the detritus of his and Ciri\u2019s afternoon snack, but by the time he leaves the pantry, his lute slung carefully across his back, the sky is already dark. He pauses for a moment by the training ground, squinting at the vague shapes of three witchers who are now sparring in the dark, then makes his way through the keep to the eastern curtain wall. He\u2019s still tense as he climbs the steps up to the top of the wall, but by the time he\u2019s perched in his usual place, heels kicking gently at the outside stonemasonry, he can feel a little of the tension seeping away. It\u2019s a cloudy night, the moon only glimmering across the glens in slim slivers, but he doesn\u2019t mind: the darkness is almost relaxing. </p>\n<p>Jaskier sits on the top of the wall, the cold wind curling through his hair, picking absent chords from the strings of his lute until his fingertips are too numb to feel. </p>\n<p>Somewhere far away, hidden by the blackness of the night, a wolf howls in the mountains, long and lonely. </p>\n<p>Jaskier knows that the only reason he hears the footsteps behind him is because he\u2019s meant to. He forces himself not to flinch, not to stiffen, not to let the fear and pain eat him alive from the inside out \u2013 and, oh, now that he\u2019s thinking about it, maybe Eskel\u2019s right. That\u2019s not the subtlest image in the world, is it? If he\u2019s going to get a real classic out of his whole fuck-up of a situation, he\u2019s going to have to make sure he\u2019s not so\u2026 <i>on the nose</i> with the whole thing. That\u2019s a surefire way to slip into mediocrity.</p>\n<p>\u201cEskel said I\u2019d find you here.\u201d </p>\n<p>Jaskier blows a breath out slowly, watching as it freezes on the air. \u201cI like it up here,\u201d he answers. \u201cIt\u2019s peaceful. And the view is beautiful, especially at sunset.\u201d </p>\n<p>Geralt moves slowly, quietly. He almost seems unsure as he joins Jaskier on the wall, sitting a little further away than Eskel does, and then he says, \u201cIt\u2019s a long fall. It\u2019s not safe.\u201d </p>\n<p>Jaskier suddenly remembers another mountain, another cliff-face, another conversation where he talked about everything and anything except what he actually wanted to talk about. \u201cHow\u2019s Ciri?\u201d he asks, changing the subject to stop his heart bleeding out in his chest. Again, so <i>literal</i>, so <i>over the top</i>. And he thought heartbreak was supposed to be <i>good</i> for artists. </p>\n<p>\u201cShe\u2019s sleeping,\u201d Geralt answers. \u201cThe journey here wore her out.\u201d He pauses for a second, then says, \u201cThanks for feeding her.\u201d </p>\n<p>Jaskier snorts. \u201cIt was mostly figs and honey,\u201d he says flatly. \u201cNot exactly a balanced diet.\u201d </p>\n<p>Geralt hums, and doesn\u2019t answer. </p>\n<p>\u201cYou went and found her, then,\u201d Jaskier says eventually. \u201cYour Child Surprise.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cI did.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s good,\u201d Jaskier says, then lapses into silence. </p>\n<p>Here\u2019s the thing: Geralt isn\u2019t particularly good at words. Oh, he\u2019s eloquent enough when he needs to be, he can spin up the perfect words to tell a lord to go fuck himself or to explain in perfect specific detail what a milkmaid needs to do to prevent malicious magical spores from coming back and sending all her cattle into a frenzied rolling-eyed panic every full moon. But when it comes to more delicate matters, to <i>emotions</i>, to <i>feelings</i>, well, he\u2019s borderline useless. And that\u2019s the void that Jaskier always used to fill. He would spill his own leaking heart into the quiet between them, chatter on about everything and nothing, never really expecting to get much of a response and being eternally delighted whenever Geralt saw fit to grace him with a hum or a few words or even just a smile. So this dynamic that they\u2019re resting in now, this quiet, it\u2019s not unusual. </p>\n<p>What <i>is</i> unusual is that Jaskier absolutely fucking refuses to fill it.</p>\n<p>Geralt shifts next to him, clearly uncomfortable. \u201cCan we get down off the wall?\u201d he asks after what seems like an age. </p>\n<p>\u201cWorried I\u2019ll fall?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI want to talk to you,\u201d Geralt says, every word measured and careful, \u201cand I want to be able to see your face when I do.\u201d </p>\n<p>Jaskier has known Geralt in pretty much all emotional states, scared, furious, mocking, even affectionate, even nervous \u2013 but he doesn\u2019t think he\u2019s ever heard him sound quite as <i>vulnerable</i> as he does right now. And, fuck it all, Jaskier has never been able to refuse Geralt anything he asks for. That\u2019s sort of part of the problem, of course, but he just sighs, nods. \u201cSure,\u201d he says. \u201cSure, that\u2019s fine.\u201d</p>\n<p>Geralt goes first, padding silently down the worn steps that lead to the small courtyard behind the eastern wall. He turns and watches as Jaskier follows him, footsteps heavier, louder, more human, his lute slung across his back and one hand steadying himself against the stones because, well, fuck, apparently he\u2019s a little shakier than usual. Not that surprising, really, given his current situation \u2013 and he comes to the bottom, stands a careful distance away from Geralt, crosses his arms. \u201cSo,\u201d he says, and doesn\u2019t elaborate. </p>\n<p>\u201cEskel explained why you\u2019re here,\u201d Geralt says. \u201cHe said he had to save you from Nilfgaard twice, that they wanted you to get to me and Ciri.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d Jaskier says, flat as he can manage. </p>\n<p>Geralt bows his head. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have been in danger because of me,\u201d he says, his voice quieter. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t supposed to happen.\u201d </p>\n<p>Jaskier shrugs, an uncomfortable one-shouldered affair that jostles his lute more than he intends. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d he says. \u201cI was lucky enough to stumble across another witcher who was kind enough to offer me his protection, so, you know. I don\u2019t need your help.\u201d </p>\n<p>Something sharp and almost <i>painful</i> crosses Geralt\u2019s expression \u2013 but Jaskier knows that, to anyone else, Geralt\u2019s face has hardly moved at all, barely a flicker of an eyelid, a twist of the lips. \u201cEskel seems to like you,\u201d he says. </p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s because I\u2019m actually a very likeable person,\u201d Jaskier says flatly, then adds, \u201cAnd I like him, too. He called me his friend the other day, you know? Didn\u2019t take him, oh, two decades to get to that point. <i>Friend</i>. Pure and simple.\u201d He snorts. \u201cI finally found myself a witcher who isn\u2019t afraid of human emotion. I\u2019m not going to lie, it was a little confusing at first. I didn\u2019t really know what to do with it \u2013 but, you know, I coped. I figured it out.\u201d </p>\n<p>The look in Geralt\u2019s eyes is strained, shadowed. He doesn\u2019t speak.</p>\n<p>Jaskier sighs, looks down. This isn\u2019t going well. \u201cI told Eskel I\u2019d listen to whatever it is you want to tell me,\u201d he says. \u201cSo go on, Geralt. Talk to me.\u201d </p>\n<p>Geralt takes a step forward. \u201cI wanted to thank you,\u201d he says, quiet and oddly formal. \u201cFor saving Eskel\u2019s life. He\u2019s a good man, and it would have grieved us all to have lost him. So thank you for that.\u201d He pauses, giving Jaskier an opportunity to interject, but there\u2019s a strange little buzzing building in the back of Jaskier\u2019s skull that\u2019s stopping him from forming much by way of coherent thought. \u201cHe\u2019ll be a worthwhile subject for your songs,\u201d Geralt is saying, his lips quirking bitterly. \u201cProbably better than I ever was. He\u2019s better with people than I am.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jaskier just stares him. </p>\n<p>Geralt looks a little bemused by his continued silence, but he keeps on gamely going. \u201cCiri will benefit from your presence here, I think,\u201d he says. \u201cShe seemed calmer after she spoke to you. She has\u2026 nightmares, and she\u2019s human, like you. If you could\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<i>Are you fucking kidding me?</i>\u201d </p>\n<p>Jaskier isn\u2019t sure what broke the dam that was holding back his words, that was keeping him silent and stupefied, but Geralt stops short, surprise flashing bright in his golden eyes, and, well, fuck, Jaskier guesses this is happening now. He takes a step closer, his hands balling into fists at his sides, his shoulders hunching around his ears, and his breath is like fire in his lungs. \u201cIs this how you\u2019re going to do it?\u201d he asks, sharp and shrill, chest heaving. \u201cIs this how you\u2019re going to fucking apologise? By telling me that Eskel will give me plenty of songwriting material and asking me to play nursemaid to the Lion Cub of fucking <i>Cintra</i>?\u201d </p>\n<p>Geralt\u2019s nostrils flare in that particular combination of frustration and anger that Jaskier knows oh so well. \u201cAnd what <i>exactly</i> should I be apologising for?\u201d he bites off, that strange formality swept clean away. </p>\n<p>Jaskier can\u2019t help it: he laughs. He flat out laughs, borderline deranged. \u201cYou cast me away like a dog,\u201d he says, and it\u2019s flat and it\u2019s bitter and it\u2019s full of a year\u2019s worth of pain and heartbreak. \u201cI gave you the best years of my very short human life, and you spat them back in my face. And you don\u2019t think that deserves a fucking <i>apology</i>?\u201d </p>\n<p>Geralt closes the distance between them in a single stride. \u201cYou don\u2019t exactly seem to be <i>suffering</i> because of it,\u201d he spits \u2013 and wait, what\u2019s that there, in his eyes, underneath the anger and the frustration? Oh shit, Jaskier realises with a start, it\u2019s <i>pain</i>. \u201cYou\u2019re here in my home like you\u2019re meant to be here and you\u2019re, what, <i>best fucking friends</i> with my brother now \u2013 didn\u2019t take you long to replace me, did it? And with a witcher who\u2019s <i>much</i> better suited to you than I was.\u201d </p>\n<p>There\u2019s a sickness starting to build in Jaskier\u2019s throat. \u201cI\u2019m only here because I have to be,\u201d he says tightly, \u201cand I haven\u2019t <i>replaced</i> you, Geralt, I can be friends with more than one bloody witcher.\u201d </p>\n<p>Geralt\u2019s hand shoots out and grabs him by the front of his cloak, eyes bright, almost maddened. Jaskier doesn\u2019t think he\u2019s ever seen him like this before, driven wild with anger and vulnerability and <i>pain</i>, so much pain, engraved in every line of his face \u2013 and why is Geralt looking at him with <i>so much hurt</i> in his face? What the fuck is going on? \u201cYou\u2019re supposed to be <i>mine</i>,\u201d Geralt grinds out, every word looking like it physically wounds him to say. \u201cYou\u2019re not supposed to be <i>Eskel\u2019s</i>, you\u2019re <i>mine</i>.\u201d </p>\n<p>Jaskier smacks at Geralt\u2019s hand, unsurprisingly doesn\u2019t manage to dislodge him in the slightest. \u201cYours?\u201d he trills. \u201c<i>Yours?</i> I\u2019m a fucking <i>person</i>, Geralt \u2013 and yeah, okay, I get that it\u2019s easiest for your bloody fellow witchers to call me <i>Geralt\u2019s bard</i> but I am <i>not</i> about to take that shit from <i>you</i> as well!\u201d</p>\n<p>Geralt\u2019s grip tightens, and he pulls Jaskier closer, impossibly closer, his golden eyes sparking with something strange, something bright, something heated. </p>\n<p>Jaskier knows that look. Lambert wore that look when he sat across the table from him in the small hall and caught a crust of bread out of the air, ate it with his gaze on Jaskier like he was <i>prey</i>. </p>\n<p>It hits Jaskier all at once. </p>\n<p>He\u2019s pretty sure his mouth literally drops open. \u201cWhat the <i>fuck</i>, Geralt?\u201d he whispers. </p>\n<p>Geralt snarls at him, wordless and animal, and all that emotion he\u2019s <i>so damn good</i> at bottling up just\u2026 overflows. He lunges forward, kisses Jaskier with a vehemence that borders on the violent \u2013 and it\u2019s everything Jaskier has ever wanted and it\u2019s so fucking <i>wrong</i> that he doesn\u2019t know what to do, because he loves Geralt, yes, of course he does, he loves him with every fibre of his weak human heart, but Geralt is <i>out of control</i>. He doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s doing, he <i>can\u2019t</i>, and so Jaskier pushes at his chest, pushes him away as much as he can, and when Geralt\u2019s lips leave his it\u2019s like <i>dying</i> but it\u2019s what he has to do. \u201cNot like this,\u201d he gasps, winding his hands in Geralt\u2019s shirt, trying to calm him, trying to bring him back from whatever precipice of <i>his own heartbreak</i> he\u2019s hurled himself over. \u201cGeralt, please. Calm down, I need you to <i>calm down</i>.\u201d </p>\n<p>All of a sudden, Geralt goes very, very still. </p>\n<p>Jaskier blinks, his heart beating rabbit-fast in his chest. \u201cGeralt?\u201d </p>\n<p>Geralt looks at him, pupils blown wider than Jaskier has ever seen them without a potion, and his nostrils flare in that very, very distinctive way that witchers have when they\u2019re scenting the air around them. </p>\n<p>All of a sudden Jaskier realises that he still hasn\u2019t had a chance to take a godsdamned bath. </p>\n<p>Geralt\u2019s hands drop from his cloak and he steps backwards, steps away, his head held at an angle, chest heaving like he\u2019s just run the whole way here. \u201cYou fucked Lambert,\u201d he says, an odd note in his voice, not the strange formality of earlier, no, this is something different. It\u2019s almost disassociated. It\u2019s absent \u2013 and, ah, shit, Jaskier gets it. </p>\n<p>\u201cGeralt,\u201d he says, vaguely aware that he\u2019s using the kind of voice he\u2019d use to try to calm a spooked horse. \u201cGeralt, look at me. I haven\u2019t replaced you, I could <i>never</i> replace you.\u201d He reaches out, tries to catch Geralt\u2019s hand \u2013 but Geralt just moves away. \u201cGeralt, do you hear me?\u201d </p>\n<p>The absence in Geralt\u2019s expression resolves into a crystalline hardness that Jaskier <i>has</i> seen before. It\u2019s the look he wears when he\u2019s stoned out of small-minded, backwards villages, it\u2019s the look he tries to hide when mayors sneer in his face and ironmongers spit at his feet. It\u2019s hurt and it\u2019s betrayal, and Jaskier never thought he would see that look on Geralt\u2019s face because of <i>him</i>. </p>\n<p>Geralt turns on his heel and takes off through the corridors of the keep. </p>\n<p>\u201c<i>Shit</i>,\u201d Jaskier husks, and runs after him.</p>\n<p>Except Geralt is a witcher, of course, with witcher strength and witcher stamina and, most importantly right now, <i>witcher speed</i>, so Jaskier doesn\u2019t stand a chance of keeping up with him. That doesn\u2019t matter, though, because Jaskier knows where he\u2019s going. It\u2019s the evening, it\u2019s just after dinner, the others will be gathered in the small hall, sharing a drink and their strange witcher camaraderie, <i>Lambert</i> will be sharing a drink and that strange witcher camaraderie, and Jaskier is abruptly very, very glad that Ciri\u2019s already gone to bed.</p>\n<p>He hears shouts of alarm from up ahead, and he runs faster.</p>\n<p>When Jaskier comes skidding into the small hall, lute clutched in his hands in a frantic effort to stop it being bashed to pieces against his back, Geralt has Lambert flat on his back on the floor, hand fisted in his shirt, and Lambert\u2019s bloody nose is spewing across his lips and chin. As Jaskier watches, momentarily speechless, Geralt punches Lambert again, in the gut this time, driving all the wind out of him \u2013 and Jaskier spent the morning watching witchers fight each other, watching them dance around each other with grace and precision and perfection, but this is absolutely anything but that. </p>\n<p>\u201c<i>Geralt!</i>\u201d Eskel barks, and in the blink of an eye he\u2019s on him, Co\u00ebn joining him half a second later, the two of them forcibly dragging Geralt off a very dazed-looking Lambert. \u201cWhat the fuck are you doing?\u201d Eskel snaps in Geralt\u2019s face, into his snarling, grief-stricken face \u2013 and then he looks up, sees Jaskier, glances between him and Lambert, and his expression blossoms into understanding. \u201cI told you to take a fucking bath,\u201d he growls at Jaskier, then shoves Geralt down when he tries to get up again. \u201cLambert, you should go.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cWhat the fuck did <i>I</i> do?\u201d Lambert snarls, one hand pressed to his nose. \u201cHe just fucking <i>leapt</i> at me!\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cGo,\u201d Vesemir orders, tone brooking no argument. \u201cAnd you, bard.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cBut I\u2014\u201d Jaskier tries. </p>\n<p>\u201c<i>Go</i>,\u201d Eskel snaps at him, frustration thick in his voice, and he shoves his knee into Geralt\u2019s chest, uses his bodyweight to pin him to the ground. He glances up at Jaskier. \u201cThis is <i>not</i> what I meant when I told you to talk to him.\u201d </p>\n<p>Vesemir strides forward, grabs Lambert by the collar and Jaskier by the arm, guides them both out of the small hall. \u201cClean yourself up, both of you,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019ll deal with him.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cVesemir,\u201d Jaskier starts, but Vesemir closes the door in his face before he can say anything else.</p>\n<p>Lambert swears, dabs tentatively at his nose. \u201cWhat the fuck got into <i>him</i>?\u201d he asks. \u201c<i>Ow</i>, fuck, this <i>hurts</i>.\u201d </p>\n<p>Jaskier lets out a shaky breath. His heart is pounding in his chest, and he can still feel the ghost of Geralt\u2019s hands in his cloak, the memory of the press of his lips. \u201cHe smelled you on me,\u201d he says shortly, holding his lute to his chest, cradling it like he would a child. \u201cHe smelled what we did last night.\u201d </p>\n<p>Lambert frowns. \u201cAnd he reacted like <i>that</i>?\u201d He pauses, and his eyes go wide. \u201cFuck, Jaskier, you never said that <i>he felt the same way</i>.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jaskier has had about enough of this witcher bullshit for one day. \u201cRight,\u201d he says, rubbing his forehead. \u201cOkay. Thanks for that, Lambert. I\u2019m gonna go take a bath.\u201d </p>\n<p>Lambert eyes him. \u201cYou okay?\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d Jaskier says, and all of a sudden he\u2019s just so fucking tired. \u201cSee you tomorrow.\u201d </p>\n<p>Jaskier leaves Lambert standing outside the small hall, blood dripping into the neck of his shirt, and goes to his room. He leaves his lute, gathers up soaps and oils, then makes his way through the dimly lit corridors to the bathhouse, buried deep in the bowels of Kaer Morhen. It\u2019s more functional than flamboyant, a series of artificial pools carved into the living rock that are fed by the hot springs inside the mountain, lit by flickering oil lamps, but the only thing Jaskier gives a shit about now is getting in that hot, faintly sulphurous water and scrubbing his skin red and raw.</p>\n<p>He strips off his clothes, leaves them in a haphazard pile on the floor and sinks into the nearest pool, submerging himself completely under the water, eyes closed, breath caught tight in his chest. He stays under for as long as he can manage, until his lungs are bursting for air, then breaks the surface, gasps in a breath, slumps back against the edge of the pool and runs a hand through his sopping wet hair. \u201cShit,\u201d he whispers to the echo of the rocky bathhouse. \u201c<i>Shit</i>.\u201d </p>\n<p>Jaskier washes his hair with quick, jerky motions, then reaches for a cloth and cleans his body as thoroughly as he can, wiping away the sweat and the grime with detached precision. He runs his hands over the finger-shaped bruises on his hips, the fingernail scratches in his thighs, the bitemark dug into his belly \u2013 and he breathes out through his nose, fingers clenching in the washcloth, eyes prickling with tears. Fuck, he doesn\u2019t even know why he\u2019s so <i>sad</i> \u2013 he should be happy, shouldn\u2019t he? Geralt fucking <i>kissed</i> him. He\u2019s dreamed of that happening for literally <i>years</i>, and now it\u2019s happened and it\u2019s done and it\u2019s over and he\u2019s getting the horrible feeling that he\u2019s managed to ruin everything already. </p>\n<p>\u201cFuck,\u201d he says, and sinks under the surface of the water once again. </p>\n<p>Jaskier stays in the bathhouse for a long time, curled against the carved side of the pool, doing his best to lose himself in the warmth of the water and the rich, sweet smell of his orange oil. His breathing steadies, after a while, his heartbeat slows \u2013 and he starts to feel the ache in his legs from his headlong dash through the keep, feet sore, knees twinging. Combined with the bruises at his hips and the still-lingering echo of the hangover, he feels like, well, shit. </p>\n<p>Footsteps sound in the corridor outside, quick and sharp, and Eskel comes padding into the bathhouse before Jaskier can start to panic. He plumps himself down next to Jaskier\u2019s pool, sighs heavily and says, \u201cWell, <i>that</i> was a fucking mess.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cIs he okay?\u201d Jaskier asks. </p>\n<p>Eskel nods. \u201cHe\u2019s alright,\u201d he says, softer. \u201cWe calmed him down before he broke anything else. Or any<i>one</i> else.\u201d He shakes his head. \u201cHe felt like shit pretty much immediately, wanted to come find you. Vesemir said that if he dared come close to you right now he\u2019d kick him out of the keep, and then told him to go to bed.\u201d </p>\n<p>Jaskier laughs faintly. \u201cGeralt of Rivia, sent to bed like a naughty child.\u201d </p>\n<p>Eskel watches him, his eyes a rich, dark gold in the light from the lamps. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d he asks, incredulous, astonished. \u201cThe last I saw him, he was coming to find you to tell you he\u2019s in fucking <i>love</i> with you, not to lose his <i>head</i> like that.\u201d </p>\n<p>Jaskier has had a very long day. </p>\n<p>He leans forward in the sulphur-heated pool, skin raw and over-sensitive from the constant heat, nose full of the smell of oatmeal soap and orange oil, and buries his face in his hands. He stays there like that for a long moment, eyes closed, just breathing, but then he thinks <i>he\u2019s in fucking love with you</i> and it\u2019s way, way too much. He sucks in another breath, short and trembling, and then he just can\u2019t do it anymore and he\u2019s crying, sobbing, struggling to get enough oxygen into his lungs between hoarse, wracking sobs. </p>\n<p>\u201cFuck,\u201d Eskel mutters, then splashes into the pool next to him without a second thought, fully dressed, boots and everything. He pulls Jaskier to him, strong and solid, wraps his arm around his shoulders and tucks his head under his chin. \u201cIt\u2019s alright,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s okay. You\u2019re okay.\u201d </p>\n<p>Jaskier just cries, and he doesn\u2019t even really know what he\u2019s crying for. </p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jaskier sleeps until midmorning, curled up in his mound of furs and blankets, surrounded by the familiar, soothing scents of oatmeal soap and orange oil. He misses breakfast, obviously, so when he finally manages to leave his room he goes to root around in the pantry, eats a couple more of the dried figs he plundered with Ciri yesterday\u2014gods, was that only yesterday?\u2014and fights the urge to wash them down with a nip of vodka. He doesn\u2019t have much appetite, which is both unsurprising and frustrating, so he slips a bread roll into his pocket for when he inevitably gets horrifically hungry a few hours down the line. </p>\n<p>He can hear familiar voices coming from the training ground. He takes a breath, steadies himself, and goes. </p>\n<p>Kaer Morhen\u2019s training ground is clearly designed for more witchers than the handful who are currently wintering at the keep, which is a realisation that twists Jaskier\u2019s heart a little more than it probably should. It also means that, even with all of the keep\u2019s current inhabitants occupying that circle of beaten earth, they don\u2019t fill it, not even close \u2013 and Jaskier pauses at the edge, arms folded across his chest, surveying. Vesemir is currently showing Ciri something that looks worryingly like a miniature version of a witcher sword, Eskel at his shoulder offering occasional commentary with a wry smile, and Co\u00ebn seems to be setting up some form of bizarre torture apparatus involving unpadded wooden beams that Jaskier is guessing is actually for agility training. What\u2019s more surprising, though, and what makes Jaskier\u2019s breath catch in his throat a little, is the fact that Geralt and Lambert are currently lounging together on the low bench Jaskier spent yesterday morning on, recovering from his hangover \u2013 and they\u2019re not fighting, not arguing, no, they\u2019re just sitting there, knees comfortably butted up against each other in their sprawls, watching as Ciri takes the blade from Vesemir with a serious, intense expression on her young face. </p>\n<p>Something twists in Jaskier\u2019s chest, longing and yearning and grief all tied up together. </p>\n<p>Lambert catches sight of him standing there awkwardly, then elbows Geralt in the side and says something Jaskier can\u2019t hear. Geralt glances over, every line of his body suddenly flooding with tension, and then so does Eskel \u2013 who promptly shoots Geralt a look that says in no uncertain terms <i>stay the fuck down</i> and comes to Jaskier\u2019s side. </p>\n<p>This whole thing is so fucking weird that Jaskier sort of wants to laugh, but he figures that really wouldn\u2019t help right now so he keeps it in. </p>\n<p>Eskel cocks an eyebrow at him. \u201cYou alright?\u201d </p>\n<p>Jaskier nods, not quite trusting himself to speak just yet. </p>\n<p>\u201cYou eaten something?\u201d Eskel asks. \u201cYou missed breakfast.\u201d </p>\n<p>Jaskier rolls his eyes. \u201cYes, <i>mother</i>, I\u2019ve eaten something,\u201d he says, taking refuge in mockery. \u201cI washed behind my ears, too \u2013 do you want to check?\u201d </p>\n<p>Eskel\u2019s lips quirk. \u201cI know you did,\u201d he says. \u201cI watched you trying to drown yourself in the baths, remember?\u201d </p>\n<p>Jaskier flushes. \u201cThat\u2019s not what I was doing,\u201d he mutters. </p>\n<p>Eskel\u2019s quiet for a moment, and Jaskier is suddenly keenly aware of the fact that Geralt is watching them, laser-focused. Now that Jaskier thinks about it, he can probably hear every word they\u2019re saying, too \u2013 godsdamned witcher hearing. \u201cGeralt wants to talk to you,\u201d Eskel says eventually, voice determinedly neutral. \u201cAnd he promises that he\u2019ll <i>actually</i> talk this time, instead of losing his shit and going to break Lambert\u2019s nose again.\u201d On the bench next to Geralt, Lambert snorts and says something that Jaskier is pretty sure is along the lines of <i>he can fucking try</i> \u2013 which just confirms that, well, every bloody witcher on the damn training ground can hear this conversation. </p>\n<p>\u201cWell,\u201d Jaskier says, aiming for bright and breezy. \u201cIf he <i>promises</i>.\u201d </p>\n<p>Eskel laughs, then reaches out, grips Jaskier\u2019s shoulder. \u201cYou sure?\u201d </p>\n<p>Jaskier lets out a low breath. \u201cI\u2019m sure.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cWant me to come along?\u201d Eskel asks, and there\u2019s a seriousness in his expression that seems to oddly settle Jaskier\u2019s nerves. \u201cHe\u2019s not going to react like he did yesterday, he\u2019s fucking sworn he won\u2019t, but I understand if it\u2019d make you feel safer.\u201d </p>\n<p>Jaskier blinks. \u201cAre you\u2026\u201d He trails off, clears his throat. \u201cAre you offering to protect me?\u201d he says quieter, stepping a little closer. \u201cFrom <i>Geralt</i>?\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cI can if you need me to,\u201d Eskel answers, just as quiet. </p>\n<p>Jaskier\u2019s heart thuds so hard against his ribs it hurts. \u201cGeralt would never hurt me,\u201d he says softly, then laughs, short and a little bitter. \u201cNot physically, at least.\u201d He pauses, remembers the djinn. \u201cAt least not on purpose.\u201d </p>\n<p>Eskel doesn\u2019t look convinced. \u201cYou sure about that?\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201c<i>Yes</i>, I\u2019m sure,\u201d Jaskier answers, exasperation seeping into his voice. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t <i>my</i> nose he broke, was it?\u201d He reaches up, covers the hand that Eskel\u2019s still got gripping his shoulder and squeezes lightly. \u201cAnd anyway, if he <i>does</i> break me in another fit of jealous, emotionally-repressed rage, I expect you to avenge my death in an appropriately dramatic fashion then get the best bard Oxenfurt can produce to compose an epic ballad about my tragic fate.\u201d He wrinkles his nose. \u201c<i>Not</i> Valdo Marx. I trust Co\u00ebn\u2019s taste, he can help you find someone suitable.\u201d</p>\n<p>Eskel smiles a little and drops his hand. \u201cGeralt,\u201d he says, not raising his voice in the slightest \u2013 but Geralt\u2019s on his feet immediately, covering the space between them in a handful of heartbeats. Vesemir and Co\u00ebn keep Ciri distracted, fortunately, Co\u00ebn showing her what looks like basic fencing footwork and Vesemir strategically positioning himself so the bulk of his body blocks off this bizarre tableau Jaskier\u2019s found himself a part of \u2013 and then Geralt\u2019s just <i>there</i>, broad and silent, his yellow-gold eyes heavy on Jaskier like he never wants to stop looking at him. </p>\n<p>Eskel puts himself between the two of them and faces Geralt, his jaw set. He doesn\u2019t say a word, just stares Geralt down \u2013 and Geralt just takes it, steady, unmoving. Eskel sighs, after a long moment, then punches Geralt\u2019s shoulder and says, bordering on playful, \u201cDon\u2019t fuck this up, brother.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t plan to,\u201d Geralt says, deep and solid in his chest. </p>\n<p>Eskel sighs, glances back to Jaskier one last time, and leaves them to it. </p>\n<p>Geralt just stands there for a moment, looking somewhere between deeply uncomfortable and starkly hopeful. \u201cWould you like to go somewhere else?\u201d he asks, soft and pausing. </p>\n<p>Jaskier eyes the others. \u201cMight be best,\u201d he says, and leads them away from the training ground. It\u2019s a bright but cold day, the sun shining in the pale blue sky with little real heat, and the stones of Kaer Morhen are icy to the touch. Jaskier shrugs his fur-lined cloak closer around himself, buries his chin in the softness of the collar, and just walks. \u201cI don\u2019t know where I\u2019m going, by the way,\u201d he says after a moment. \u201cJust figured that we probably didn\u2019t want to have this conversation where everyone else could hear.\u201d He snorts. \u201cThey already know <i>far</i> more about this whole situation than I\u2019d like them to.\u201d </p>\n<p>Geralt hums, low and familiar, and Jaskier can\u2019t help it \u2013 something warm and affectionate twists in his heart at the sound. He takes a breath, pushes the feeling to one side. Not now. \u201cI know a place,\u201d Geralt says, apparently unaware of Jaskier\u2019s inner struggle, and takes the lead. </p>\n<p>Jaskier follows, as always. </p>\n<p>Geralt leads him to a small courtyard somewhere in the outer ring of the keep. It\u2019s open to the sky but perfectly positioned to catch the mid-morning sun, and there\u2019s a rectangular stone table sitting in the middle, heavy wooden benches set on either side. Iron trelliswork stretches overhead, laced with bare green vines that, Jaskier\u2019s assuming, flower in the spring, hang heavy with leaves in the summer, drop fruit in the autumn, and there\u2019s traces of ornamental carvings stretching around the courtyard\u2019s walls in a wide band at shoulder height. There\u2019s a little snow on the ground, a few icicles hanging from the trellis, but it\u2019s early enough in the winter that the ice hasn\u2019t had much of a chance to build up yet. </p>\n<p>Jaskier gazes around, borderline wondrous. \u201cI\u2019ve not seen this courtyard before,\u201d he says. \u201cVesemir must not have brought me here when he gave me the tour.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t exactly have a purpose,\u201d Geralt says, taking a seat on one of the wooden benches. \u201cVesemir likes things that have a purpose. But it\u2019s peaceful.\u201d He shrugs, self-conscious. \u201cI thought it might be appropriate.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s <i>beautiful</i>,\u201d Jaskier corrects, wandering over to the carved band, running his fingertips along images that he\u2019s pretty sure tell of witcher history, battles and banquets, monsters and magics. \u201cI\u2019m going to have to try to remember how to get here.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cI can show you the way again,\u201d Geralt says, then pauses, adds, \u201cIf you like.\u201d </p>\n<p>Ah, yes. There\u2019s a reason they came here. </p>\n<p>Jaskier leaves the carvings, goes to the table, brushes a few flakes of snow off the bench opposite Geralt and takes a seat. The expanse of stone stretches between them, wider than it looks, and all of a sudden Jaskier\u2019s heart is in his throat. Geralt\u2019s watching him, expression still but golden eyes as vulnerable as they were last night, the faint breeze catching loose strands of his silver-white hair, and, fuck, he\u2019s as stupidly beautiful as he always was. </p>\n<p>Geralt clears his throat. \u201cSo,\u201d he says. </p>\n<p>Jaskier licks his lips. \u201cSo,\u201d he echoes, and spreads his hands palm-down on the table between them.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou never had any problem with me fucking other people before,\u201d Jaskier says. </p>\n<p>It\u2019s maybe not the <i>least</i> confrontational opening gambit he\u2019s ever gone for, but, oddly enough, it seems to work. Geralt\u2019s shoulders relax, just a little, and he leans forward, props his elbows on the stone table. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t because you <i>fucked</i> Lambert,\u201d he says, golden eyes bright. \u201cIt was because you fucked <i>Lambert</i>.\u201d </p>\n<p>Jaskier raises an eyebrow. \u201cSo it would be fine if I\u2019d fucked Eskel?\u201d he asks, trying for some reason to keep this whole thing lighthearted because, you know, the last time they got serious Geralt broke someone\u2019s nose.</p>\n<p>Geralt\u2019s lips thin. \u201cThat would be worse.\u201d </p>\n<p>Jaskier\u2019s stomach twists, and he remembers that bitter, frantic betrayal in Geralt\u2019s eyes. \u201cTo be clear,\u201d he says, shifting a little in his seat, \u201cI don\u2019t want to fuck Eskel. I also don\u2019t really want to fuck any of the other witchers I\u2019ve met up here, including Lambert.\u201d He pauses for a beat, then figures, well, he\u2019s committed now. \u201cI only want to fuck <i>you</i>, Geralt, but that\u2019s just a bit\u2026 complicated right now.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cI want that, too,\u201d Geralt says, his voice strangled and tight in his chest. </p>\n<p>Jaskier flinches almost violently, then forces himself to take a breath. \u201cOkay,\u201d he says, rubbing at his face to hide the way that his hands are shaking, to disguise the fact that he can\u2019t meet Geralt\u2019s eyes. \u201cShit. Right.\u201d </p>\n<p>They sit in silence for a long moment. </p>\n<p>Surprisingly enough, Geralt\u2019s the one who breaks it. \u201cI fucked up,\u201d he says shortly, and it\u2019s such a straightforward Geralt of Rivia statement that, perversely, it warms Jaskier\u2019s heart. \u201cAfter the dragon hunt. I was pissed off with Yen, and with Borch, and with\u2026 <i>Destiny</i>. And you were an easy target.\u201d </p>\n<p>Jaskier picks at an invisible spot on the table with his thumbnail. \u201cSpeaking of my favourite violet-eyed terrifying sorceress,\u201d he says, and leaves it there. </p>\n<p>Geralt\u2019s lips tighten, and for the first time he looks away. \u201cYou heard about Sodden?\u201d </p>\n<p>Jaskier blinks. The question\u2019s a little unexpected, but given the stories he\u2019s heard about what happened at the Battle of Sodden, he thinks he might know where Geralt\u2019s going with this. \u201cI have,\u201d he says. \u201cBig stand off between Nilfgaard and a bunch of scrappy sorcerers, right?\u201d </p>\n<p>Geralt nods. \u201cYen was there,\u201d he says. \u201cShe was hurt, pretty badly.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cIs she okay?\u201d Jaskier asks, surprised to find concern needling at his heart. </p>\n<p>\u201cShe\u2019s alright,\u201d Geralt answers. \u201cRecovering. We stayed with her for a while, me and Ciri, in this little cottage she had hidden away in the woods.\u201d His lips quirk at the corner, just a little. \u201cIt was peaceful, very rustic. You would have liked it.\u201d He pauses, apparently studying the carvings that run around the span of this little courtyard. \u201cWe spoke,\u201d he says. \u201cShe was\u2026 less angry than she was before. And she loves Ciri.\u201d </p>\n<p>Jaskier takes a breath, tries not to think about this as preparing to get his heart broken all over again. \u201cSo you\u2019re back together?\u201d</p>\n<p>Geralt shakes his head. \u201cNo,\u201d he says, and Jaskier can tell by the flare of his nostrils and the slump of his shoulders that it\u2019s painful for him to talk about. \u201cWe agreed that it\u2026 wasn\u2019t a good idea. That we aren\u2019t good for each other as lovers, but that we can maybe be better as friends.\u201d He pauses, just briefly, glances up at Jaskier for the first time. \u201cShe wants to be a part of Ciri\u2019s life,\u201d he says, something almost <i>nervous</i> in his voice. \u201cThe plan is that Ciri will spend the winter here, learning to defend herself, then she\u2019ll go to Yen to train as a sorceress, too.\u201d </p>\n<p>Jaskier\u2019s eyebrows jump. \u201cA princess-witcher-sorceress?\u201d he asks, and all of a sudden his fingers are itching for his lute. \u201cNow <i>that\u2019s</i> going to be a song worth singing.\u201d </p>\n<p>Geralt gives him an odd look. \u201cWould you <i>want</i> to sing it?\u201d he asks, strangely tentative.</p>\n<p>Jaskier scoffs. \u201cHave you ever known me <i>not</i> to want to sing a song like that?\u201d he asks \u2013 then realises half a heartbeat too late that, oh, that\u2019s not the question Geralt is asking. \u201cGeralt,\u201d he says, a little breathless. \u201cJust so I\u2019m clear. What you\u2019re <i>actually</i> asking me there is whether I want to be a part of your life again \u2013 yours, and Ciri\u2019s? And apparently maybe also Yennefer\u2019s?\u201d</p>\n<p>Geralt nods, wordless. </p>\n<p>\u201c<i>Of course</i> I want that,\u201d Jaskier says before he can think better of it \u2013 and then, because obviously he immediately starts overthinking, \u201cIf that\u2019s what you want?\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cI do,\u201d Geralt says. A muscle jumps in his jaw. \u201cI missed you.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cFucking hell, Geralt,\u201d Jaskier says, his voice tight. \u201cYou really know how to make a man feel weak at the knees, you know that?\u201d </p>\n<p>Geralt smiles, just the faintest curl of his lips. \u201cYesterday,\u201d he starts, then stops, exhales through his nose. \u201cI didn\u2019t expect you to be here,\u201d he says, after a long moment of silence. \u201cI didn\u2019t <i>want</i> you to be here.\u201d </p>\n<p>Jaskier huffs a short laugh. \u201cThanks.\u201d </p>\n<p>Geralt frowns, shakes his head. \u201cNot like that,\u201d he says, voice tight. \u201cI thought you\u2019d be in Oxenfurt, or Novigrad, maybe. Somewhere safe, somewhere far away from the war. I <i>need</i> you to be safe.\u201d Jaskier\u2019s heart thuds louder against his ribs at the sheer <i>fear</i> in Geralt\u2019s voice. \u201cYou\u2019re not safe here,\u201d Geralt says, and then, \u201cYou\u2019re not safe if you\u2019re <i>with me</i>.\u201d </p>\n<p>Jaskier snorts. \u201cI think I conclusively proved that the safest place for me to be right now is with a witcher,\u201d he says dryly. \u201cI was just lucky that I bumped into Eskel when I did.\u201d </p>\n<p>Geralt\u2019s gaze is steady, no flare of jealousy, no throb of impending violence. \u201cYour smell is all over him,\u201d he says, words clipped and short. \u201cThe others, too, but mostly Eskel.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s a problem?\u201d </p>\n<p>Geralt doesn\u2019t answer. </p>\n<p>Jaskier remembers. \u201cBecause I\u2019m supposed to be yours,\u201d he says, echoing the words that spilled from Geralt\u2019s lips like venom last night. They\u2019re softer, in the light of day. \u201cYou know I am, Geralt. Yours.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know,\u201d Geralt says. \u201cI couldn\u2019t tell. I thought\u2026\u201d He trails off, breathes. \u201cI thought I\u2019d lost you,\u201d he says. \u201cI thought you\u2019d moved on. I thought I\u2019d fucked it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou thought I\u2019d replaced you,\u201d Jaskier says softly. \u201cThat\u2019s what you said, that I\u2019d replaced you with Eskel.\u201d \u2013 and he doesn\u2019t say it, doesn\u2019t say it because it\u2019s too raw even for this moment, but he knows how hard it is for Geralt to lose people, knows how hard it is when they leave him. It must be so much worse to be left for one of his brothers, one of the few people in this world that he\u2019s supposed to be able to trust without hesitation, without reservation. \u201cAnd then,\u201d Jaskier says, slower, so careful, \u201cyou smelled Lambert on me. And that was <i>another</i> kind of replacement.\u201d </p>\n<p>Geralt drops his head. \u201cI didn\u2019t deal with that well.\u201d </p>\n<p>Jaskier laughs quietly. \u201cNo, you didn\u2019t.\u201d He cocks his head. \u201cLooked like you\u2019ve patched things up with him, though.\u201d </p>\n<p>Geralt nods. \u201cWe\u2019re good.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cDid you\u2026 talk to him?\u201d Jaskier asks, fighting the urge to laugh. \u201cOr did you just go down the more witchery route and let him punch you back?\u201d </p>\n<p>Geralt\u2019s lips twitch in a smile. \u201cVery funny.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cI think so,\u201d Jaskier says archly. </p>\n<p>Geralt\u2019s quiet for a minute. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have kissed you like that,\u201d he says, mouth twisting in a sharp slant of distaste. \u201cI didn\u2019t give you a choice. I just\u2026 couldn\u2019t stop.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cYou stopped when I asked you to,\u201d Jaskier says, then he shifts in his seat, tries to smile. \u201cAnd under different circumstances\u2014just so you know, for future reference\u2014I think I\u2019d really quite like it if you kissed me like that.\u201d </p>\n<p>Geralt studies him, and for a long moment he\u2019s as silent as the mountains around them. \u201cFor future reference,\u201d he echoes eventually, his golden eyes bright as the cold sun. </p>\n<p>Jaskier\u2019s heart beats a little faster. \u201cI mean, if I\u2019m not allowed to let your witcher brothers fuck me,\u201d he says lightly, trying not to sound quite as breathless as he feels, \u201cthen I figured I should probably be entitled to <i>something</i> from you instead.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou have everything from me,\u201d Geralt says, and it\u2019s so unexpectedly heartfelt that Jaskier <i>does</i> lose his breath. </p>\n<p>They just sit there for a moment, facing each other across a stone table in the icy cold of Kaer Morhen. The sky is blue and wide overhead, and far above a hawk spins in circles, riding the updrafts. </p>\n<p>\u201cHow long?\u201d Geralt asks. </p>\n<p>Jaskier understands. He shrugs, leans back, piles his hands in his lap. \u201cI\u2019ve wanted to shag you from the moment I saw you,\u201d he says. Geralt\u2019s wry smile sends a thrill of delight through his heart, and he beams back, then laughs, says, \u201cOh, and look.\u201d He reaches into his pocket, pulls out the roll he took from the pantry earlier. \u201cI\u2019ve got bread in my pants again.\u201d He rips the roll in two, tosses one half to Geralt and takes a bite out of the other. \u201cIf we\u2019re talking about more than just sex, though?\u201d he says, easy and straightforward, around a mouthful of the fresh bread that Co\u00ebn made this morning. \u201cThat took a little while longer.\u201d He nods thoughtfully. \u201cIt was probably when you took all that money the kid in Posada gave you to kill their mysterious devil and just gave it away to Filavandrel and his people without a second thought.\u201d </p>\n<p>Geralt, halfway through a mouthful of bread, looks stunned. \u201cThat was the day we met.\u201d </p>\n<p>Jaskier smiles. \u201cI know it was, I was there,\u201d he says, laughing, then shrugs. \u201cIn my defence, I tend to fall in love pretty quick. It\u2019s just that, well, usually I fall <i>out</i> of love just as quickly. But this time, that never happened.\u201d He pauses, eats another mouthful. \u201cYou?\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cLong enough,\u201d Geralt says. </p>\n<p>Jaskier snorts. \u201cThat\u2019s all you\u2019re going to give me?\u201d he asks, incredulous. \u201c \u2018Long enough\u2019? I mean, I know you\u2019re monosyllabic, Geralt, but <i>come on</i>.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201c \u2018Enough\u2019 is two syllables.\u201d </p>\n<p>Jaskier splutters. \u201c<i>Geralt</i>.\u201d </p>\n<p>The lick of amusement in Geralt\u2019s eyes fades as quickly as it appeared. \u201cI couldn\u2019t let myself feel that way,\u201d he says finally. \u201cIt was dangerous. For you.\u201d He pauses for a second, finishes the bread. \u201cPeople don\u2019t like witchers, Jaskier. They tend not to like witchers\u2019 lovers, either. So I\u2026 ignored it. As much as I could.\u201d </p>\n<p>There\u2019s something primal and dark that thrills in Jaskier\u2019s gut at <i>witchers\u2019 lovers</i>, but now really isn\u2019t the time to be focusing on that. \u201cTurns out they\u2019re not huge fans of witchers\u2019 bards, either, if you hadn\u2019t noticed,\u201d he points out. \u201cFuck knows what would have happened to me if Eskel hadn\u2019t been around to stop me getting taken. Nothing good, I imagine.\u201d </p>\n<p>Darkness flashes in Geralt\u2019s eyes. \u201cShould have been me.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cYes, it should have been,\u201d Jaskier says, open and honest because, well, he\u2019s not wrong, is he? \u201cBut I stumbled across Eskel, dying in a ruined farmhouse, and then <i>he</i> stumbled across <i>me</i>, drugged and in the process of being abducted \u2013 and we\u2019re all here now, safe and sound in Kaer Morhen.\u201d He lets out a long breath, watches Geralt closely. \u201cSo what now?\u201d</p>\n<p>Geralt\u2019s nostrils flare. \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d he asks. </p>\n<p><i>There\u2019s</i> a question. \u201cI want you,\u201d Jaskier says, then scratches the side of his head. \u201cBut I somehow don\u2019t think it\u2019s the best idea for us to just fall into bed, you know?\u201d He grimaces. \u201cYou did break my heart, after all. And I <i>want</i> you to, you know, have your wicked witcher way with me in pretty every room in Kaer Morhen, I really do \u2013 but I think I need a little more time.\u201d</p>\n<p>Geralt nods. \u201cWhatever you need.\u201d </p>\n<p>Jaskier pauses, doesn\u2019t move. \u201cI love you,\u201d he says, the words like rose thorns on his tongue. </p>\n<p>Geralt inhales sharply. \u201cI love you,\u201d he answers, a confession and an apology all at once. </p>\n<p>Jaskier flashes him a smile. \u201cNow that <i>that\u2019s</i> sorted out,\u201d he says, bright and cheery, \u201cyou should probably get back to making sure that Lambert doesn\u2019t corrupt that sweet little Cintran princess any more than you\u2019ve already managed to ruin her.\u201d He gets to his feet, brushes breadcrumbs off his cloak, and Geralt mirrors him on the other side of the table. \u201cPoint me in the direction of the eastern wall? I need my daily dose of gazing wistfully at the scenery like the poet I am.\u201d </p>\n<p>Geralt\u2019s lips twitch in that little half-smile of his again. \u201cFollow that corridor,\u201d he says, pointing. \u201cWhen it forks, go right. That will take you to the stables.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cI know the way from there,\u201d Jaskier says, nodding. He pauses for a second, a tightness in his heart like a coiled spring, then moves around the table, purposeful and quick before he can change his damn mind \u2013 and he takes Geralt\u2019s face between his hands and kisses him, brief and fleeting and barely more than a press of lips to lips, if he\u2019s honest, definitely not his best work by any stretch of the imagination, fuck, he kissed <i>Lambert</i> with more passion than that. </p>\n<p>Geralt looks like he\u2019s just seen the faces of the gods. </p>\n<p>\u201cRight,\u201d Jaskier says, his heart thundering in his chest, fighting to school his features into the cool, calm, relaxed expression of a world-famous bard who absolutely isn\u2019t going moon-eyed over an emotionally stunted witcher. \u201cOkay. I\u2019ll see you later, Geralt.\u201d </p>\n<p>Jaskier goes, stepping down the corridor Geralt pointed him to with alacrity, the heels of his boots snapping on the cold stone, and winds through the passageways of Kaer Morhen with ease, head held high. He makes it to the eastern wall in short order. He scrambles up to the top of the wall, boots slipping a little in his haste, then takes his usual spot, feet kicking out over the beauty of the continent\u2019s majesty, full of the glens and rivers and lochs and sky, full of the world in its glory, full of life.</p>\n<p>The grin on his face is broad and bright enough to put the sun to shame. </p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Dinner that night is full of laughter and alcohol, the table groaning under the weight of the haunch of boar that Vesemir spent the afternoon slow-roasting over a spit in the large kitchen. It\u2019s a celebration, Jaskier thinks, a celebration of the fact that they\u2019re all here, that they\u2019re alive, that they made it through another year \u2013 but no one says as much, so he figures he won\u2019t bring it up. Ciri plants herself next to him, hair a messy mop that <i>really</i> needs a brush before it starts to tangle so bad it won\u2019t come out, and pretty much narrates her whole day, the training, the drills, the tour of the armoury that Lambert apparently gave her \u2013 which, well, Jaskier thinks he\u2019s going to have to talk to these bloody witchers about what exactly is appropriate entertainment for a Cintran princess. </p>\n<p>But at the same time, there\u2019s such bright excitement in her eyes that it makes Jaskier\u2019s heart warm. </p>\n<p>The boar is delicious, the ale is cold, and the fire lights the small hall with its dancing warmth. </p>\n<p>Ciri starts to droop, eventually, tired out by the cold and a long day of the physicality of witchers. The others don\u2019t notice, to start off with, engrossed in a laughingly-loud argument that\u2019s raging between Lambert and Co\u00ebn. Ciri rests her cheek against Jaskier\u2019s shoulder, eyelids fluttering, and he rests his arm around her shoulders, brushes hair out of her eyes. \u201cHey, Ciri,\u201d he says softly. \u201cYou want to go to bed?\u201d </p>\n<p>She nods, her hand wound into the thick wool of his sleeve. </p>\n<p>He strokes her hair. \u201cI\u2019m going to need you to wake up just a little bit,\u201d he murmurs, and she shakes her head, buries deeper into his jacket. He laughs, presses a kiss to her pale hair. \u201cI don\u2019t know where your room is, darling, you\u2019ll need to show me.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll take her,\u201d Geralt says, his voice little more than a rumble in his chest. He\u2019s crouched down next to the bench, one hand already resting against Ciri\u2019s back, and he gently lifts her into his arms. She protests a little, but then she shifts, nestles into his shoulder, and dozes off once more. Geralt makes sure she\u2019s comfortable, readjusts the wrap of her cloak, then flashes Jaskier a soft smile. \u201cGoodnight, Jaskier.\u201d </p>\n<p>Jaskier feels his heart swell in his chest. \u201cNight,\u201d he says, a smile flickering around his lips, and he watches Geralt carry Ciri out of the small hall. He\u2019s known Geralt a long time, sure, he knows that he\u2019s not the harsh, cruel monster the world wants him to be \u2013 but he doesn\u2019t think he\u2019s ever seen this <i>softness</i> to him before. </p>\n<p>He didn\u2019t think that he could love that bloody witcher any more than he did already. </p>\n<p>Across the table, Lambert snorts. \u201cFucking hell, bard, you are <i>gone</i> on him, aren\u2019t you?\u201d </p>\n<p>Jaskier throws a scrap of oily gristle at him and hits him in the eyebrow, then crows his victory as Lambert pulls a face and wipes grease off his eyelid. </p>\n<p>\u201cStop it, you two,\u201d Vesemir grumbles, then sighs. \u201cAnd here I thought that a courtly bard would bring a little <i>dignity</i> to Kaer Morhen.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got the wrong bard if you\u2019re after dignity, Vesemir,\u201d Eskel jokes. </p>\n<p>Jaskier kicks him under the table. \u201cI\u2019m very dignified, thank you very much!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou slept with Lambert,\u201d Co\u00ebn says, laughing sharply. \u201cThat\u2019s not usually considered particularly dignified.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cHey!\u201d Lambert protests.</p>\n<p>\u201cA moment of madness,\u201d Jaskier dismisses archly. </p>\n<p>Eskel barks a laugh, and Lambert shoots him a look, leans forward with his eyebrow raised, elbow slipping into Geralt\u2019s discarded plate. \u201cYou weren\u2019t complaining when I had my cock in your\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<i>Lambert!</i>\u201d Vesemir snaps. </p>\n<p>Lambert flushes bright red, and Co\u00ebn practically <i>guffaws</i>. </p>\n<p>Once the others have peeled off one by one to bed, Jaskier and Eskel are left to tidy up. They carry the used dishes through to the kitchen, then Eskel washes them as Jaskier runs a broom around the usual mess that\u2019s left in the small hall after meals \u2013 crumbs, thrown food, spills of ale. It\u2019s late by the time they\u2019re done, everything spotless and ready for breakfast tomorrow, and they slump down next to the guttering fire, sharing a final drink. \u201cSo,\u201d Eskel says, heavy with meaning. \u201cHow was your little\u2026 <i>talk</i>?\u201d He snorts, sips his ale. \u201cGeralt managed not to punch anyone tonight, which is an improvement, and don\u2019t think I didn\u2019t notice that you basically <i>melted</i> when he picked up Ciri like that.\u201d </p>\n<p>Jaskier sighs. \u201cThe talk was good,\u201d he says, nodding. \u201cSurprisingly\u2026 verbal? As in, there was actual talking? With words?\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cMiracles do happen,\u201d Eskel says, mock wondrous. </p>\n<p>Jaskier laughs. \u201cI think we\u2019ve patched things up,\u201d he says. \u201cSorted some things out.\u201d </p>\n<p>Eskel nods. \u201cDo I need to trip him up when we\u2019re training? Push him down the well? Leave a pile of Llwyd\u2019s shit in his bed?\u201d </p>\n<p>Jaskier rolls his eyes. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to protect my damn virtue, Eskel.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cWell, as the whole Lambert situation demonstrates, you <i>clearly</i> can\u2019t protect it yourself,\u201d Eskel points out, then cocks his head. \u201cYou going to let Geralt have a go at your virtue, too?\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201c<i>Eskel</i>.\u201d </p>\n<p>Eskel raises an eyebrow. \u201cWell, are you?\u201d </p>\n<p>Jaskier squints at him. \u201cYou told me in no uncertain terms that you didn\u2019t want to know <i>anything</i> about what happened with Lambert,\u201d he says. \u201cNow you\u2019re asking\u2026 that?\u201d</p>\n<p>Eskel sighs, glances at the guttering fire. He\u2019s quiet for a moment. \u201cI don\u2019t want to know if you\u2019re going to fuck him,\u201d he says eventually. \u201cI want to know if you\u2019re going to\u2026 <i>be with</i> him.\u201d </p>\n<p>Jaskier\u2019s heart twists. \u201cHe asked me if I wanted to be a part of his life,\u201d he says, flexing his fingers around his mug of ale. </p>\n<p>\u201cDo you?\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cObviously I do,\u201d Jaskier answers, but his smile is a little sad. \u201cBut what\u2019s to stop him just\u2026 being an arsehole again?\u201d He\u2019s quiet for a moment. \u201cI love him, sure, and apparently\u2014<i>astonishingly</i>\u2014he feels the same about me, but\u2026\u201d He trails off. </p>\n<p>\u201cDo you trust him?\u201d Eskel asks quietly. </p>\n<p>Jaskier sighs. \u201cThat\u2019s the question.\u201d </p>\n<p>Eskel hums. \u201cWell, there\u2019s no rush,\u201d he says. \u201cThe snows will set in soon, and then we\u2019re all stuck here until it melts. It\u2019s a good couple of months. Plenty of time.\u201d </p>\n<p>Jaskier thinks about the last year of his life, alone on the road, the quiet days, the silent nights. \u201cI guess.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cOr,\u201d Eskel says, studying him carefully, \u201cyou could just decide <i>fuck it</i>, and crack on.\u201d </p>\n<p>Jaskier laughs. \u201cI\u2019m sure there\u2019s a happy medium somewhere.\u201d</p>\n<p>Eskel shrugs, and drinks slowly. \u201cYou don\u2019t smell afraid,\u201d he says after a moment. \u201cWhen he got here, when he snapped at you like that, you smelled\u2026 gods, Jaskier, it was just this flood of <i>panic</i>. I thought you were gonna pass out. It was like when you nearly got taken by those fucking Nilfgaardians \u2013 not good.\u201d He shakes his head, sinks down deeper in his chair. \u201cLast night wasn\u2019t much better, when you came running in here after Geralt. So much <i>fear</i>, Jaskier, <i>fuck</i>. It\u2019s not a good thing to smell on a friend, not good <i>at all</i>. But now you just smell like\u2026 you. It\u2019s better.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cNot like Lambert?\u201d </p>\n<p>Eskel snorts. \u201cThank the gods, not anymore.\u201d He wrinkles his nose. \u201cWhen you do fall into bed with Geralt, <i>please</i> have a bath before you see me. I honestly don\u2019t think I can take that again.\u201d </p>\n<p>Just for a moment, Jaskier thinks about Geralt, about the press of his lips, the brightness of his eyes, the warmth of his body. The winter nights that they spent curled around each other, sharing heat, sharing breath. The play of the scars across his bare chest, the wet heat of his skin in the bath. </p>\n<p>\u201c<i>Stop it</i>,\u201d Eskel groans, pressing his hand to his eyes. </p>\n<p>Jaskier laughs and gets to his feet. \u201cI\u2019m going to bed,\u201d he says, leaving his mug on the end of the table. \u201cGot something to\u2026 take care of.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cWhat the <i>fuck</i>, Jaskier!\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m joking!\u201d Jaskier laughs, then waggles his eyebrows. \u201cMaybe.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cFuck you, bard,\u201d Eskel grouses. </p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019ll have to talk to Geralt about that first,\u201d Jaskier answers lightly. </p>\n<p>A surprisingly affectionate smile plays around Eskel\u2019s lips. \u201cIt\u2019s good to see you happy, Jaskier,\u201d he says. \u201cIt suits you better than heartbreak.\u201d </p>\n<p>A wave of warmth floods Jaskier\u2019s chest. He smiles, softer, gentler. \u201cIt feels good, too,\u201d he says, then, \u201cI\u2019ll see you tomorrow, Eskel.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNight,\u201d Eskel says, and settles back in his chair. </p>\n<p>Jaskier goes back to his room, padding softly through the quiet corridors of the keep. He crawls into his mound of furs and blankets, buries himself deep, closes his eyes and goes to sleep with the memory of Geralt\u2019s silver-white hair caught in the dance of the breeze, whispering in a carved courtyard with a winter-stripped vine twining the trellis above his head. </p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Days settle into a routine at Kaer Morhen. </p>\n<p>The witchers train in the mornings, dancing around each other with the kind of speed and agility that Jaskier can only dream of \u2013 and in between training with each other, they train Ciri, as well. She takes to it like a duck to water, running their forest trails and leaping their apparatuses with increasing confidence, her long ash-blond hair pulled back in a tangled, knotted plait that Jaskier does his best to untangle every night before dinner. The afternoons are quieter, more relaxed, less structured, and once the day\u2019s maintenance has been finished, Jaskier spends his hours at the eastern wall, or in the library, or in the baths. </p>\n<p>Geralt joins him, sometimes, not all the time, and they talk. It\u2019s comfortable, it\u2019s easy, it\u2019s like they always were before \u2013 but there\u2019s a charged undercurrent, too, an intimacy that sets Jaskier\u2019s heart racing, because Geralt keeps <i>touching</i> him. Only lightly, and never without permission, but now there\u2019s a hand pressing against his lower back in the halls, an ankle nudging his under the table, and once, when he was bending over his lute in concentration on a windy day at the eastern curtain wall, Geralt brushed his hair out of his eyes with such tentative, exacting care that Jaskier forgot to breathe for a second.</p>\n<p>They haven\u2019t kissed since that day in the carved courtyard. </p>\n<p>Jaskier\u2019s cleaning out Roach\u2019s stall in the stables one morning, chattering to her merrily about the quantity and quality of her shit, sneaking her apple slices out of his pocket when he thinks the other horses can\u2019t tell \u2013 which is ridiculous, obviously, because they\u2019re horses, but he sort of feels bad about not lavishing Llwyd with the same attention. \u201cYou\u2019ll keep my secret, though, won\u2019t you, girl?\u201d he murmurs, rubbing Roach\u2019s velvety nose, and laughs quietly when she bumps her head against his shoulder. \u201cYou\u2019ve been keeping them for years, after all.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been telling Roach your secrets?\u201d </p>\n<p>Jaskier didn\u2019t even hear Geralt approach. There\u2019s a bale of hay in his arms and a tiny smile on his lips, and he watches Jaskier as he deposits his burden in the stables. \u201cYou talk to Roach all the time,\u201d Jaskier says primly. \u201cIs there a reason I shouldn\u2019t?\u201d </p>\n<p>Geralt runs his hand through Roach\u2019s mane, rubs her forehead, tugs her ears affectionately. \u201cWhat secrets have you told her?\u201d he asks, something almost nervous in his voice. </p>\n<p>Jaskier smiles, warm in the cold of winter. \u201cMostly about how I saw your arse when you were bathing in the river a few years ago and I\u2019ve had constant dreams about it ever since,\u201d he says, tapping his chin thoughtfully. \u201cOr how the sunset makes your eyes blaze like fire and it drives me <i>mad</i>. How I watch your hands when you\u2019re sharpening your swords and I want those hands to be doing\u2026 other things.\u201d He shrugs, smiles innocently. \u201cJust things like that.\u201d </p>\n<p>Geralt\u2019s gaze is heavy. \u201cJaskier,\u201d he says, then pauses, just for a moment, cautiously reaches out and brushes his fingers against Jaskier\u2019s cheek. \u201cCan I kiss you?\u201d </p>\n<p>Jaskier\u2019s heart thuds so fucking hard in his chest. \u201cIn front of <i>Roach?</i>\u201d he asks, mock-scandalised. </p>\n<p>Geralt laughs, a surprising lightness to the sound, and he takes Jaskier\u2019s hand, pulls him away from Roach and into one of the empty stalls. They\u2019re out of sight of the courtyard, away from the horses, hay caught in Geralt\u2019s hair and horse shit rubbed into Jaskier\u2019s boots. \u201cIs this better?\u201d Geralt asks, soft, intimate, loving.</p>\n<p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t kiss me right now,\u201d Jaskier says, voice trembling, \u201cI swear I\u2019ll\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>But he doesn\u2019t get a chance to finish his threat because Geralt kisses him, long and searching, his hands cupping Jaskier\u2019s face, caressing his neck. Jaskier melts into it, sighs against Geralt\u2019s lips as Geralt presses him up against the rough wood of the stall, body hard and firm and oh, shit, Jaskier thinks he could die like this. </p>\n<p>Geralt breaks away, rests his forehead against Jaskier\u2019s. \u201cYou okay?\u201d he asks, concern in his voice. </p>\n<p>Abruptly Jaskier realises that there are tears on his cheeks. \u201cI\u2019m good,\u201d he says, carding his fingers through Geralt\u2019s hair. \u201cYeah, I\u2019m better than good. I\u2019m <i>great</i>.\u201d </p>\n<p>Geralt smiles and kisses him again, just as intimate, just as perfect. \u201cYou should finish mucking out Roach\u2019s stall,\u201d he whispers, after a moment. </p>\n<p>\u201cAnd you should probably go make sure that Co\u00ebn doesn\u2019t let Ciri crack her head on that torture beam thing again,\u201d Jaskier answers, just as soft. </p>\n<p>Neither of them moves for a long while.</p>\n<p>Jaskier can\u2019t quite wipe the smile off his face for the rest of the morning. </p>\n<p>Lambert appears in the stables a little before lunch with a sugar cube for his mare, and he eyes Jaskier a little suspiciously. \u201cWhat are you grinning about?\u201d he asks, tugging a knot out of his horse\u2019s mane with gentle fingers, then he sniffs. A sly smile quirks his lips. \u201cGeralt was here, wasn\u2019t he?\u201d </p>\n<p>Jaskier flushes. \u201cHe was.\u201d </p>\n<p>Lambert folds his arms, leans against the wall of Llwyd\u2019s stall. \u201cYou two kissed,\u201d he says, and it isn\u2019t a question. \u201cIt\u2019s going well then, I take it?\u201d </p>\n<p>Jaskier just glares at him. </p>\n<p>\u201cWant me to give him some tips?\u201d Lambert asks, full-on smirking now. \u201cGet him up to speed with how you like to be fucked before the main event?\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201c<i>Lambert</i>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMaybe how you like getting your hair pulled?\u201d Lambert says thoughtfully. \u201cOr that you really seemed to enjoy getting thrown around a bit?\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cYou know I\u2019m literally holding a shovel full of shit right now?\u201d Jaskier says. \u201cAnd I will throw it in your face?\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cOr how you made the <i>filthiest</i> noises when I twisted my fingers just like\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>Jaskier throws the shovel full of shit at him. Most of it splatters the ground in front of Lambert\u2019s boots but more than enough splashes up the front of his trousers, a little reaching as high as his thigh, and he splutters, looking suddenly appalled. \u201cThe <i>fuck</i>, Jaskier?\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cI did warn you.\u201d </p>\n<p>Lambert glowers at him. \u201cCome here,\u201d he says, stalking towards Jaskier \u2013 who abruptly realises that he just threw a shovel full of horse shit at a witcher, and bolts. He makes it as far as the small courtyard just outside the stables before Lambert tackles him around the waist, bringing him crashing to the paving stones with an undignified yelp. Lambert pins him to the ground with his thighs and traps his hands either side of his head, then snorts, raises an eyebrow. \u201cThis feels familiar.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cGet off, you bastard,\u201d Jaskier laughs. </p>\n<p>Lambert raises an eyebrow. \u201cYou going to throw shit at me again?\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cOnly if you\u2019re an arsehole again.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cFair enough,\u201d Lambert says, and lets him up. He hauls them both to their feet, brushes Jaskier down brusquely, then flashes him a startlingly genuine smile. \u201cI\u2019m happy for you,\u201d he says, quieter. \u201cHonestly.\u201d And then, because he\u2019s Lambert: \u201cBut I <i>am</i> very happy to give Geralt some advice. It\u2019ll be hard for him to live up to the standard I\u2019ve set, and I wouldn\u2019t want you to be too disappointed, you know?\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cThere is a lot more shit in that stable, Lambert,\u201d Jaskier says flatly, trying not to smile. </p>\n<p>Lambert shrugs. \u201cYour loss,\u201d he says, and goes. </p>\n<p>That afternoon, Jaskier wraps himself tightly in his cloak, gets his lute, and goes to the eastern curtain wall. It\u2019s even colder than it was when he first arrived here with Eskel, now, and the sky is heavy with snowclouds \u2013 but there\u2019s a vibrancy burning in his heart that he doesn\u2019t want to waste. He clears snow off the top of the wall, takes his usual seat, and takes a long breath before his fingers start to dance across the strings. He\u2019s been working on this for a few weeks now, editing and changing, experimenting with keys and tonality, but he thinks he might have finally got it \u2013 so he sings it now, sings it for the wilds of the mountains and the stones of the keep, sings it into the snow that\u2019s just starting to fall. </p>\n<p>It\u2019s a song of history and memory, of loss and grief, but it\u2019s a song of today, as well, of Kaer Morhen as it is, as it survives. The stone and the wood, the swords and the horses, the food in the kitchens and the smoke in the fireplaces, it\u2019s everything, it\u2019s everything that Jaskier has found in this place, the safety, the companionship, all of it. It\u2019s a song of the people who spend their winters here, the witchers, their strength, their sorrows, and sometimes it hurts to sing \u2013 but it\u2019s a <i>good</i> kind of hurt. </p>\n<p>Jaskier sings to the mountains, the words sweet and heavy on his tongue, and watches the snow fall heavier, and heavier, and heavier. </p>\n<p>And then he remembers that he\u2019s sitting on a very high, very slippery wall with an irreplaceable elven lute that\u2019s rapidly getting covered in snow. He yelps, covers his lute with his cloak, and scrambles down to shelter. </p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The snow keeps falling for the next four days. </p>\n<p>The witchers keep training as much as before because, as Vesemir tells Jaskier, they need to be able to be at their best in all kinds of weather. At first, they keep Ciri with them, but when her teeth start to chatter and her lips start going blue, Geralt scoops her up and brings her inside. Jaskier\u2019s in the small hall when he does, getting a decent enough fire going to warm the hall for the afternoon, and he looks up when Geralt brings Ciri to the fire, sits down in front of the hearth and wraps her in his warm embrace. \u201cYou okay there, Ciri?\u201d Jaskier asks, frowning. </p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m <i>fine</i>,\u201d Ciri objects, but there\u2019s a sluggishness to her tone that belies her words. </p>\n<p>Jaskier catches Geralt\u2019s gaze. \u201cThere\u2019s hot water in the kitchen,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ll get her something to drink, help warm her up.\u201d </p>\n<p>Geralt nods, his expression worried.</p>\n<p>Jaskier runs to the kitchen, grabs a cup of warm water and brings it back, along with a lump of cheese and a scrap of ham. He gets Ciri to cradle the cup in her cold hands and breathe in the steam before she drinks it, then gives her the cheese and the ham, watches carefully as she eats them both, leaning back against Geralt\u2019s chest. He tucks her hair back behind her ears, takes her hands in his to warm, then asks, \u201cBetter?\u201d </p>\n<p>Ciri nods. \u201cSorry,\u201d she whispers. </p>\n<p>Jaskier frowns. \u201cWhat for?\u201d </p>\n<p>Ciri twists, looks up at Geralt. \u201cI couldn\u2019t keep up with you,\u201d she says, her voice so damn <i>small</i>. \u201cYou and Co\u00ebn, the daggers, it was so cold, I couldn\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>Geralt shushes her, holds her tighter. \u201cYou have nothing to apologise for, Ciri,\u201d he says softly. \u201c<i>Nothing</i>.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Geralt says. \u201cYou\u2019re human, Ciri. You can\u2019t deal with the cold like we can, you don\u2019t have our stamina. You have to learn to know your own limits, not <i>our</i> limits. And you have to <i>push</i> your own limits \u2013 but not to the point that you harm yourself.\u201d He pauses, holds Ciri\u2019s gaze. \u201cDo you understand?\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cI understand,\u201d Ciri says, eyes so bright and so young. </p>\n<p>Jaskier looks at them, the witcher and the princess, sitting in front of a crackling fire at Kaer Morhen, snowmelt on their clothes, dripping to the stones beneath them, and abruptly realises that this is exactly where he wants to be for the rest of his life. With <i>them</i>, whatever happens. </p>\n<p>That night, after dinner, Jaskier puts his hand on Geralt\u2019s wrist, lets his touch linger. \u201cCome with me?\u201d he asks softly, aware that his heart has started beating harder in his chest and all these bloody witchers can probably hear it. </p>\n<p>Geralt nods. \u201cOf course,\u201d he says, and follows him out of the small hall. </p>\n<p>The snow is still falling outside, steady and thick, blanketing everything in a thick carpet of impenetrable white. The parts of the keep that aren\u2019t heated are <i>cold</i>, bitterly so, and Jaskier finds himself shivering even in the covered corridors. \u201cGods, it\u2019s cold,\u201d he says, pressing closer to Geralt. \u201cReally wishing I had your magical witcher body chemistry right now.\u201d </p>\n<p>Geralt just hums, then wraps his arm around Jaskier\u2019s shoulder and holds him close as they walk. \u201cWhere are we going?\u201d he asks. </p>\n<p>\u201cHere,\u201d Jaskier says, and stops outside the door to his bedroom. </p>\n<p>Geralt looks at him, what Jaskier thinks might be hope shining in his eyes. \u201cJaskier?\u201d </p>\n<p>Jaskier\u2019s mouth is oddly dry, and he opens the door. \u201cIt\u2019s warmer in here,\u201d he says, tugging Geralt inside. \u201cI keep a fire burning pretty much all day otherwise I can\u2019t sleep, it\u2019s so cold. Come on. No point in freezing our backsides off out in the snow when we don\u2019t have to.\u201d </p>\n<p>Geralt shuts the door behind him, then stands there in the space between the table and the bed, looking remarkably awkward for such a powerful man. Jaskier just looks at him for a long moment, takes him in, broad shoulders and strong arms and so much more. \u201cGeralt,\u201d he says, then pauses, not quite sure what he wants to say.</p>\n<p>Geralt moves. He doesn\u2019t take his eyes off Jaskier, doesn\u2019t drop his gaze at all as he starts to strip, shedding layers of wool and fur and leather, kicking off his boots, tugging the tie out of his hair, stripping down to nothing but skin, scarred and hard in the flickering light of the fire. Jaskier forgets to breathe for a second when Geralt takes a step towards him, then another, crossing the space between them in a handful of heartbeats \u2013 and then Geralt\u2019s right there, naked and silent and the most obscenely beautiful thing Jaskier thinks he\u2019s ever seen. </p>\n<p>Geralt doesn\u2019t touch him, doesn\u2019t kiss him, just offers him the smallest, warmest smile and sinks to his knees in front of him. He sits back on his heels, looks up at Jaskier with that same warmth in his eyes, then says, \u201cEverything.\u201d </p>\n<p>Jaskier chokes, falls to his knees, seats himself astride Geralt\u2019s lap and kisses him as hard as he can. \u201cFuck, Geralt,\u201d he whispers, kisses him again. \u201cI\u2019m going to need you to get me naked <i>right now</i>, okay?\u201d </p>\n<p>The rumble in Geralt\u2019s throat is practically a growl, and his hands move faster than Jaskier thought possible, stripping him down to his skin so fast he\u2019s pretty sure some seams get torn. Geralt pulls him back into his lap, kisses him, one hand on the back of his head, the other around his waist, holding so tight it almost hurts. \u201cJaskier,\u201d he murmurs, thick with need. \u201cI want to take you to bed.\u201d </p>\n<p>Jaskier doesn\u2019t think he\u2019s never been as hard as he is right now. He makes an unintelligible noise in the back of his throat, kisses Geralt so hard their teeth clash, then says, \u201cYes, please, <i>gods</i>.\u201d </p>\n<p>Geralt stands and picks him up in one smooth motion, carries him to the bed in two steps and basically drops him in the mound of furs. Jaskier laughs, pulls Geralt down as best he can, kisses him thoroughly, deeply, runs his hands through his silver-white hair and bucks up against him. Geralt breaks the kiss, buries his face in Jaskier\u2019s neck, husks, \u201cWant to mark you.\u201d </p>\n<p>No, Jaskier is pretty sure he\u2019s never been as hard as he is right <i>now</i>. \u201c<i>Fuck</i>,\u201d he spits. \u201cAre you trying to kill me, Geralt?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIs that a yes?\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cFuck, yes, <i>right now</i>.\u201d</p>\n<p>Geralt sucks a bruise into his neck where Jaskier knows he won\u2019t be able to cover it tomorrow, bites the flesh gently, laves his tongue over the mark and then presses his knee between Jaskier\u2019s thighs, rolls his hips slowly against him. \u201cWant to touch you,\u201d he murmurs, kissing his throat. \u201cWant to come inside you. Want to make you scream my name.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201c<i>Geralt</i>.\u201d </p>\n<p>Geralt chuckles. \u201cYeah, like that,\u201d he says, and claims Jaskier\u2019s lips in a kiss. \u201cCan I?\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cGeralt, you can do whatever you want to me,\u201d Jaskier gasps. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to keep <i>asking</i>.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cYou seem to like it when I ask,\u201d Geralt says, then all of a sudden his hand wraps around Jaskier\u2019s cock, hot and firm. \u201cOr am I reading this situation wrong?\u201d </p>\n<p>Jaskier groans. \u201cIt\u2019s like a sexy threat,\u201d he gasps, doing his best to thrust up into Geralt\u2019s fist. \u201cFuck, Geralt, <i>get on with it.</i>\u201d</p>\n<p>Geralt hums\u2014because of <i>course</i> he hums\u2014and gets on with it. </p>\n<p>His touch is hot and skilled, taking Jaskier apart with all the experience of his long years, keeping him on the verge of orgasm but never quite spilling over just enough that before long Jaskier\u2019s <i>begging</i> him, incoherent and broken, arching off the bed. Geralt relents, kisses him fiercely, grabs one of Jaskier\u2019s oils\u2014the lavender, as it turns out\u2014and opens him up relentlessly, masterfully, oh <i>gods</i>, and then he pauses, smiles an astonishingly filthy smile and twists his fingers <i>just so.</i> </p>\n<p>Jaskier\u2019s answering whine is high and broken and panting. </p>\n<p>Geralt kisses his hip, wet and open-mouthed. \u201cLambert was right about that,\u201d he murmurs, laughter in his voice, and Jaskier glares at him, mouth open in outrage \u2013 but then Geralt does it again, and whatever he was about say dies on his lips. \u201cThe noises you make,\u201d Geralt says, shifting so he\u2019s kneeling between Jaskier\u2019s spread thighs. \u201cBeautiful.\u201d </p>\n<p>Jaskier groans. \u201cJust fuck me, Geralt,\u201d he husks out. \u201c<i>Please</i>.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d Geralt rumbles, voice cracking just a little, then he\u2019s hoisting Jaskier\u2019s legs up around his waist, sinking into him, rocking his hips in slow thrusts and, shit, fuck, <i>oh</i>, it\u2019s so good. \u201cShit,\u201d Geralt swears, adjusts the angle, thrusts harder \u2013 and okay, wow, now it\u2019s even <i>better</i>. </p>\n<p>Jaskier comes with tears in his eyes and Geralt\u2019s name on his lips. Geralt doesn\u2019t last much longer. </p>\n<p>They lie together for a good while after, just breathing, sticky and sweaty in the fire-warmed air. Geralt shifts, eventually, cleans them up, gathers Jaskier\u2019s discarded clothes and puts them in a slightly neater pile next to the table. Jaskier\u2019s in enough of a dozy, fucked-out haze that it takes him a while to realise that Geralt hasn\u2019t come back, and he opens his eyes, looks up, sees him standing to one side of the bed, that awkward look back on his face. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Jaskier asks. </p>\n<p>Geralt\u2019s eyes are so bright in the firelight. \u201cDo you want me to stay?\u201d </p>\n<p>Jaskier opens his mouth, closes it again, then hoists himself up on his elbows and reaches for Geralt\u2019s hand. \u201cI didn\u2019t just bring you here to fuck me,\u201d he says softly, pulling him back into the bed. \u201cYou said you\u2019d give me everything, Geralt. That\u2019s what I want. <i>Everything</i>.\u201d </p>\n<p>Geralt hums deep in his chest, and smiles. </p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jaskier wakes in Geralt\u2019s arms, sore and lazy and so fucking content that he never wants to move again. That plan is disrupted by the grumble of his stomach, unfortunately, and they get up slowly, leisurely, pausing for soft touches and long, slow kisses. Geralt disappears to his own room to grab a change of clothes and Jaskier goes straight to the small hall, finds Eskel there halfway through a bowl of Kaer Morhen\u2019s finest porridge. </p>\n<p>\u201cMorning!\u201d Jaskier says brightly, trying to keep the smile off his face, then slides onto the bench next to Eskel, too close than is strictly necessary given they\u2019re the only people in here.</p>\n<p>Eskel gives him a funny look. \u201cWhat are you doing, Jaskier?\u201d he asks \u2013 but then his eyes flicker to the bruise on Jaskier\u2019s neck, his nostrils flare almost involuntarily, and his expression dissolves into a particularly delightful combination of disgust and despair. \u201cFuck\u2019s <i>sake</i>,\u201d he sighs. \u201cWhat is <i>wrong</i> with you?\u201d</p>\n<p>Jaskier laughs and moves to a more normal distance, grabs himself a bowl and starts eating. </p>\n<p>Eskel eyes him dubiously. \u201cTell me you\u2019re going to take a bath.\u201d </p>\n<p>Jaskier shrugs. \u201cMaybe,\u201d he says around a mouthful of porridge. \u201cMaybe not, though. I\u2019ve got a busy day. Might not have time.\u201d </p>\n<p>Eskel stares at him for a second, then smiles a smile that\u2019s downright <i>evil</i> \u2013 and before Jaskier really has time to figure out what\u2019s going on, he\u2019s being tossed over Eskel\u2019s shoulder and bodily carried out of the small hall. \u201cEskel!\u201d he barks, smacking as much of Eskel\u2019s back as he can manage. \u201cWhat are you doing? Where are you taking me? <i>Put me down!</i>\u201d</p>\n<p>Eskel just pats the backs of his thighs. \u201cYou brought this on yourself,\u201d he says, sweet as honey. </p>\n<p>\u201cEskel?\u201d Jaskier hears Geralt ask, full of amusement.</p>\n<p>\u201cMorning, Geralt!\u201d Eskel answers, excessively cheery. \u201cI\u2019m just going to go give your bard a bath so I can get the smell of you two fucking out of my nose. Any issue with that?\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cNone at all.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cGeralt!\u201d Jaskier yells, but is roundly ignored.</p>\n<p>Eskel pauses a moment longer, sniffs. \u201cAnd I\u2019m going to politely request that <i>you</i> have a bath too, Geralt,\u201d he says. \u201cMainly because I can\u2019t just throw you over my shoulder and <i>make</i> you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Geralt just laughs. </p>\n<p>Eskel carries Jaskier to the bathhouse, kicking and shouting, and bodily dumps him in one of the pools, still fully clothed. He tosses a bar of soap at him, says, \u201c<i>Wash</i>,\u201d then bolts when Jaskier tries to splash him. </p>\n<p>Jaskier figures, well, he\u2019s here now, so strips off his sodden clothes and washes. Twenty minutes later, Geralt turns up with a change of clothes for him and, well, they spend a little longer than Eskel probably expected in the sulphur-hot water. </p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThat song you\u2019ve been writing up on the eastern curtain wall,\u201d Co\u00ebn says to Jaskier one afternoon as they shovel snow off the training ground. \u201cYou ever going to perform it?\u201d </p>\n<p>Jaskier shrugs. \u201cVesemir said that I could only sing it here,\u201d he answers. \u201cIt\u2019s a shame, because I think that the people of the continent really deserve to know the\u2026 <i>majesty</i> of this place \u2013 but I do get it. Witchers don\u2019t exactly trust humans, and it\u2019s probably best that they <i>don\u2019t</i> know certain things. If I was going to sing of Kaer Morhen in the cities of the world, I\u2019d have to\u2026 heavily edit it. If I just sing it here, I mean, you all know far more about this place than I do, anyway. Not like I\u2019m giving any secrets away.\u201d He leans against his shovel, kicks absently at the snow. \u201cWhich is all a long way to say that no, I probably won\u2019t ever perform it for an appreciative audience.\u201d </p>\n<p>Co\u00ebn cuts another swathe through the snow with his shovel. \u201cI meant are you ever going to perform it for us?\u201d he asks, eyebrow raised. </p>\n<p>Jaskier pauses, then smirks. \u201cI did specify an <i>appreciative</i> audience,\u201d he says, and Co\u00ebn snorts. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Jaskier says after a moment. \u201cI wasn\u2019t sure anyone here would be interested in listening. Geralt was never traditionally particularly bothered about my music, although I guess Eskel was a little more engaged when I was performing on our way here.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019d be interested,\u201d Co\u00ebn answers. </p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s because you have <i>taste</i>.\u201d </p>\n<p>Co\u00ebn laughs. \u201cVesemir, too,\u201d he says. \u201cHe\u2019s mentioned it to me, seems intrigued.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cReally?\u201d Jaskier asks, something oddly proud swelling in his chest \u2013 which is ridiculous because he\u2019s been a bard for over twenty years now, he\u2019s performed for more audiences than he can count, he\u2019s entertained dukes and countesses, princes and queens. He really shouldn\u2019t be getting excited over the approval of a grizzled old witcher who lives in a crumbling keep in the middle of the mountains. \u201cWell, I suppose I could try it out on a <i>moderately</i> appreciative audience,\u201d he allows. \u201cCiri\u2019s royalty, she should know a quality composition when she hears it. And hopefully I won\u2019t disappoint Vesemir\u2019s expectations too much.\u201d </p>\n<p> \u201cFinish clearing the snow first,\u201d Co\u00ebn says, amused. \u201cThat\u2019ll set you in good stead.\u201d </p>\n<p>Jaskier grimaces. \u201cI hate clearing snow,\u201d he says, but grabs his shovel again. \u201cWe\u2019ll just have to do it again in a few days. It\u2019s <i>pointless</i>.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cThe faster you shovel, the quicker it\u2019s done,\u201d Co\u00ebn points out. </p>\n<p>Jaskier grumbles a little more, but shovels faster. </p>\n<p>It\u2019s quiet, that evening, the snow laying thick and heavy over the keep like a shroud, and Jaskier brings his lute with him to dinner in the small hall. He\u2019s played for the witchers and the princess before, of course, a couple of times, jaunty tunes before Ciri\u2019s gone to bed, raunchy nonsense ballads afterwards, usually, but he\u2019s never felt <i>nervous</i> before. He does now, though, and he\u2019s quieter than usual as they eat, only having a <i>brief</i> argument with Lambert over the last slice of bread. </p>\n<p>Eskel\u2019s sat next to him, and halfway through, he nudges him with his elbow. \u201cYou good?\u201d he asks, soft enough that the others know to ignore him. </p>\n<p>Jaskier can feel Geralt watching from across the table, and he flashes them both a smile, nods. \u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d he says, taking a mouthful of ale. \u201cI\u2019ve just got a\u2026 debut performance in mind for tonight. Running some of the lyrics in my head.\u201d </p>\n<p>Eskel seems to accept that as an explanation, but Geralt doesn\u2019t look away. Jaskier meets his gaze, sees the concern there, the worry, because Eskel might be warm and easy and astonishingly friendly for a battle-hardened monster killer but Jaskier\u2019s life has been intertwined with Geralt\u2019s for two decades, now. Geralt knows he doesn\u2019t get nervous about new songs. Geralt knows he has more than enough confidence in his own talents that he doesn\u2019t <i>need</i> to get nervous \u2013 but here he is, regardless, clammy palms and uneven breaths. </p>\n<p>There\u2019s a trust and a support in Geralt\u2019s gaze that blazes like the fire in the hearth. </p>\n<p>Jaskier takes a breath, and turns his attention to his meal.</p>\n<p>\u201cGo on, then, bard,\u201d Lambert says, slouching back in his seat when they\u2019ve picked the platters and bowls clean. \u201cSing us a song.\u201d </p>\n<p>Ciri claps her hands loudly. \u201cYes!\u201d she says. \u201cA dancing song, I want to dance!\u201d </p>\n<p>Co\u00ebn laughs, ruffles Ciri\u2019s hair. \u201cHow do you still have so much energy?\u201d he asks. \u201cClearly we\u2019re going to have to work you <i>twice as hard</i> tomorrow if you\u2019ve got the strength for dancing.\u201d He looks up at Jaskier, smiles an eager smile. \u201cBut I think the bard\u2019s got something else in mind for tonight.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cRead my mind, Co\u00ebn,\u201d Jaskier says, getting to his feet and going to fetch his lute from the sidetable it\u2019s laying on. \u201cIt\u2019s <i>almost</i> as if we had a whole conversation about this this afternoon \u2013 what a remarkable coincidence.\u201d </p>\n<p>Eskel snorts. \u201cGet on with it, Jaskier,\u201d he says. \u201cAt this rate, it\u2019ll be spring before you even start.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jaskier sniffs, strums a chord. \u201cYou can\u2019t rush art, Eskel,\u201d he says. \u201cEven a <i>witcher</i> should know that.\u201d </p>\n<p>Geralt is just sitting there, arms folded across his chest, medallion escaping from the neck of his shirt to glint in the candlelight. He\u2019s watching Jaskier with a smile that\u2019s practically fond, eyes bright and golden-rich, and there\u2019s still hurt nestled in Jaskier\u2019s heart, deep down, a hurt that will take a long time to fade away \u2013 but it\u2019s moments like this, he thinks, that make it worth it. </p>\n<p>\u201cI call this,\u201d he says, not grand, not bombastic, just as open and honest as he can be, \u201c<i>The Song of the Mountain Cold</i>.\u201d He pauses, waves his hand. \u201cI might change that, haven\u2019t decided yet. An alternative was <i>The Song of the Mountain Wolves</i> but, you know, that\u2019s maybe a bit on the nose, don\u2019t want to be too obvious.\u201d He reconsiders. \u201cBut obvious can be good sometimes, I suppose?\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cJaskier,\u201d Geralt interrupts, soft and gentle.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Jaskier says. \u201cYeah, okay.\u201d </p>\n<p>And he sings. </p>\n<p>In many ways, it\u2019s not a complicated song. It\u2019s more a simple narrative than a technical showpiece, the rhyme scheme fairly straightforward and the melody more liltingly lyrical than anything that\u2019s going to win any prizes in Oxenfurt competitions \u2013 he\u2019s composed far more complex pieces in a far shorter timeframe. But that\u2019s the thing: this isn\u2019t a song for a competition, it isn\u2019t a ballad to be used for victory and glory. </p>\n<p>This is a song of Kaer Morhen, a song of the witchers and their home, of the things they\u2019ve lost and the things they\u2019ve suffered through \u2013 but at the same time it isn\u2019t a sad song, no, how could it be a sad song when Jaskier came to this place and found such <i>beauty</i>? And yeah, sure, the landscape is beautiful and there\u2019s more than a few stanzas devoted to the extravagance of the scenery and the quiet majesty of the keep \u2013 but what he\u2019s singing about when he sings about the beauty of Kaer Morhen is the beauty of its <i>witchers</i>. Scarred and broken in their own individual ways, heartbroken and heartsick, handy with a sword and a shovel and a broom, full of stories and traumas and suffering \u2013 but still welcoming, still friendly, still <i>loving</i>. They\u2019re a study in contradictions, an essay in complexities, and Jaskier would let all the technicians in the world scoff at his easy harmonies and smooth melodies if they\u2019d just take another look at his witchers. </p>\n<p>Jaskier runs out of words before he\u2019s ready to finish singing, so he just plays the notes of the last verse over and over again, hums the melody instead of singing it for as long as his voice holds out, then lets the sound peter out at its own pace until there\u2019s nothing left but silence. </p>\n<p>When he looks up, Vesemir is standing in front of him with tears in his eyes. Jaskier\u2019s too startled to react when he lifts a hand to lay against his cheek, just stands there as still as he can manage, not wanting to ruin whatever witcher ritual he\u2019s found himself in the middle of, and then Vesemir pulls his head forward, presses their foreheads together, and says, \u201cThank you, bard.\u201d </p>\n<p>A shudder runs through Jaskier\u2019s spine, tremulous and somehow ecstatic all at once. Vesemir releases him, respect and honour and <i>gratitude</i> blazing in his eyes, and then Jaskier looks at the others and there\u2019s a similar weight in all their faces, Geralt and Eskel, Co\u00ebn and Lambert, even Ciri. </p>\n<p>Jaskier doesn\u2019t quite know what to do. </p>\n<p>\u201cFuck,\u201d Lambert spits, breaking the silence and wiping at his face with his sleeve. \u201cPlay something fucking happy next before we <i>all</i> start bloody crying.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cFair enough,\u201d Jaskier says, trying to suppress the smile that\u2019s desperately twitching his lips, and launches into something a little less serious. He plays a dancing jig for Ciri, watches with a smile as she drags Co\u00ebn up and whirls him around the small hall, then she demands a pavanne so she can teach him the steps which is just such an absurdly wonderful scenario that Jaskier obeys immediately. After the minuet that Ciri requests next, Co\u00ebn declares that\u2019s quite enough of that, scoops Ciri up and tosses her into the air, and Jaskier switches to a fast-paced song of martial strife and heroic deeds that seems to suit everyone\u2019s tastes. </p>\n<p>He plays the evening out, fingers sore by the time Ciri\u2019s escorted off to bed, hand in hand with Lambert, then comes to sit next to Geralt, shoulder pressed to shoulder, thigh to thigh. Eskel passes him a mug of ale which he drinks gladly, his throat tired and sore, and nods to him, a gesture of thanks and acceptance and sincerity that makes Jaskier\u2019s heart stutter a little in his chest. He drains the ale slowly, watching Eskel return to his conversation with Co\u00ebn and Vesemir, then puts the mug down on the table with a quiet thud. </p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s a good song,\u201d Geralt says after a moment, his voice a rumble like thunder. </p>\n<p>\u201cI know it is, Geralt,\u201d Jaskier answers, brashness to cover the pride that swells in his heart. \u201cIt\u2019s one of <i>mine</i>.\u201d He pauses, sighs. \u201cIt\u2019s just a pity it can\u2019t leave the walls of the keep. It\u2019d do well in the towns, maybe less so in the cities, and it would be useful, you know? Maybe get a few more people on the side of the witchers.\u201d He shrugs. \u201cBut that\u2019s alright. I have other songs.\u201d </p>\n<p>Geralt doesn\u2019t answer for a second. \u201cYou could sing it for me,\u201d he says eventually, an awkwardness in his voice that Jaskier knows is born of trying to peel away years of control and emotional restraint. \u201cAnd Ciri, I suppose. When there\u2019s no one else around.\u201d He pauses. \u201cI\u2019d like that.\u201d </p>\n<p>Jaskier just stares at him, open-mouthed.</p>\n<p>Geralt looks embarrassed. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to,\u201d he starts to say \u2013 but oh, no, no, <i>no</i>, there is no <i>way</i> Jaskier is letting him retract that statement. </p>\n<p>He lunges forward, kisses Geralt as searingly hard as he can, winds his hands into his hair and practically climbs into his lap right there at the table in the small hall. Geralt makes a quiet noise of surprise but doesn\u2019t seem averse to the whole situation, hands settling at his waist, holding him steady \u2013 and then what feels like a morsel of stale bread hits the side of Jaskier\u2019s face and Eskel barks, \u201cGet a fucking <i>room</i>!\u201d </p>\n<p>Jaskier breaks the kiss but doesn\u2019t leave his newfound position in Geralt\u2019s lap. He finds the stale bread where it fell onto Lambert\u2019s empty plate and throws it straight back, hits Eskel in the chest, laughs at the offended noise that Eskel makes and says, \u201cYou don\u2019t like it, Eskel, <i>don\u2019t look</i>.\u201d </p>\n<p>Co\u00ebn pulls a face. \u201cI\u2019m with Eskel,\u201d he says, laughing. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a damn brothel, bard. We don\u2019t need to see that.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cWe can already <i>hear</i> it well enough,\u201d Eskel grumbles. \u201cYou\u2019re not exactly bloody quiet, Jaskier. Geralt, can\u2019t you <i>gag</i> him?\u201d </p>\n<p>Much to Jaskier\u2019s surprise, Vesemir <i>chuckles</i>, shaking his head fondly. </p>\n<p>Geralt hums. \u201cThat might shut him up long enough for a little peace and quiet,\u201d he says, mock-thoughtfully.</p>\n<p>Jaskier smacks him in the chest. \u201cLeashes, bells, gags, I am <i>horrified</i> by the things you witchers come up with.\u201d </p>\n<p>Geralt smiles, his hand squeezing lightly at Jaskier\u2019s hip. \u201cYou don\u2019t <i>smell</i> horrified.\u201d </p>\n<p>Jaskier\u2019s pretty sure he blushes to his hairline, and Eskel snorts with laughter. \u201c<i>Go</i>,\u201d he says, hurling the tiny piece of stale bread at Geralt, this time. \u201cI don\u2019t want to have to look at you two making eyes at each other anymore. You have rooms, go use them. Or at least don\u2019t use <i>this</i> room, yeah?\u201d </p>\n<p>Geralt noses at Jaskier\u2019s neck. \u201cYou did say you wanted me to have my way with you in every room in the keep,\u201d he says, barely more than a breath, and Jaskier feels heat surge in his belly. </p>\n<p>Eskel wrinkles his nose. \u201cI only heard half of that,\u201d he says, long-suffering, \u201cbut I\u2019m going to politely request one last time that the two of you fuck off before you start ripping each other\u2019s clothes off on the table.\u201d He shakes his head. \u201cI should have let those Nilfgaardians take you, bard. That would have made my life a whole lot easier.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cIn which case,\u201d Jaskier answers, lofty and arch, \u201cI should have left you to die with those wyverns, shouldn\u2019t I? Should have just taken Llwyd and left you to bleed to death in the dirt. That would have been a <i>whole</i> lot simpler.\u201d </p>\n<p>Geralt laughs, and Co\u00ebn whistles admiringly. \u201cYou have a vicious tongue.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m a bard,\u201d Jaskier says, flashing him a bright smile. \u201cIt comes with the territory. Now, Geralt. Shall we go and fuck on Eskel\u2019s bed?\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cIf you fucking <i>dare</i>\u2014\u201d</p>"
}
