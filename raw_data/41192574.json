  "notes": "<p>Second work on this site, first in both of these fandoms. Not much to say, except I hope you enjoy this!</p>\n<p class=\"jump\">(See the end of the work for <a href=\"#children\">other works inspired by this one</a>.)</p>\n<p>Due to an overwhelming amount of support, this story will be continuing! I'm at one of the most busiest times of my year, so updates will be sparse until around the end of October. If there's anything in particular you'd like to see, feel free to comment!</p>\n<p>I'm warning you now, there will be discussions of canonical child death and grief. Nothing too explicit, but still part of the chapter. You have been forewarned.</p>\n<p>\n(See the end of the chapter for <a href=\"#chapter_3_endnotes\">more notes</a>.)\n</p>\n<p>It continues! Fluff approaches, don't worry and my free time has greatly increased! If there's anything in particular you'd like to see, feel free to comment. Hope you enjoyed!</p>\n<p>I think this chapter is twice the length of previous ones. Oops.</p>\n<p>\n(See the end of the chapter for <a href=\"#chapter_4_endnotes\">more notes</a>.)\n</p>\n<p>I really appreciated seeing all the things you guys commented last time! I touched on a lot of the things some of you wanted to see, but some parts were kind of short. Fear not! There is more to come. Comment on things you want to see in the future, and I'll do my best to fit it in. Disclaimer, no Anger Management in this story. We're sticking to platonic feels in this one!</p>\n<p>You can check out my Tumblr @lirabuswavi . There's also fanart! Shout out and love to @doodlesforfics on Tumblr for the amazing art they did for the first chapter. Please check it out!</p>\n<p>\n(See the end of the chapter for <a href=\"#chapter_5_endnotes\">notes</a>.)\n</p>\n<p>Hi. It's been two months. Writer's block killed me, so the Superboy chapter has been delayed. In it's place, a slightly shorter chapter as an interlude. Jason now knows! He knew about Danny being Phantom but not Billy being Marvel, as Billy wasn't ready to tell him. Now there's another addition to the ones in the know! And welcome to the new year everyone. New year, same me though. This was based off my own experience in therapy, so I hope it felt like it worked like it does for me.</p>\n<p>The long awaited chapter, the introduction of Kon and Elle! I broke this into two parts. Part two is mostly written so should come out pretty soon. Be on the look out for that!</p>\n<p>Me: I have most of the chapter written, so the next chapter should be coming soon!<br>Writer's Block:<br>Me:<br>Writer's Block:<br>Me:<br>*Three Weeks Later*<br>Me:...Fuck.</p>\n<p>So, this took way longer than I wanted, but it's here now! Whoo!</p>\n<p>\n(See the end of the chapter for <a href=\"#chapter_7_endnotes\">more notes</a>.)\n</p>\n<p>Next up, expect to see some Danny-Billy bonding time, as someone suggested. I appreciate every single comment left here, each one makes my day! Feel free to comment what you'd like to see in future chapters, I do consider each comment/suggestion left.</p>\n<p>So. Life has kicked my ass. School, musical, upcoming graduation (so close, so fucking close, almost there) have all eaten my free time and will power. My preferred update \"schedule\" is at least once a month, and I missed last month's and almost this one too. But here it is! Danny and Billy bonding at last.</p>\n<p>\n(See the end of the chapter for <a href=\"#chapter_8_endnotes\">more notes</a>.)\n</p>\n<p>Graduation is impending. HOPEFULLY I can get something out in May, but given that musical showdates (finally), finals (ew), and graduation (pleasesocloseholyfuckplease) are all impending, it might not happen. However, next up in planning! A mini arc! Ghost King Danny, Crime Lord Jason, and one Champion of Magic who does not need a babysitter, thank-you-very-much. Should be about three chapters. Build up, climax, aftermath. As always, every singly comment and suggestion is seen and appreciated! How a lovely *squints* 1AM.</p>\n<p>After three months I am back! I have graduated, had time to recuperate, and worked on this chapter over the course of the summer so far. This is a part one of three. And welcome to our first outsider POV, hope y'all like it.<br>Going to throw out some chapter warnings for this one. Drug mentions and overdose mentions talked about in the past tense.<br>Hope you enjoy the chapter!</p>\n<p>\n(See the end of the chapter for <a href=\"#chapter_9_endnotes\">more notes</a>.)\n</p>\n<p>In the end, Jason went with a white shirt for his suit. If anyone would be willing to draw Billy and Jason in their matching outfits, I would cry. You can find me @lirabuswavi on Tumblr. As always, comments and kudos are appreciated. Thank you for reading!</p>\n<p>*Huff, wheeze* Am I- *gasp* late?<br>I'm back from the dead! Or writers block, whichever comes first. Of course the block was only for this story, and I wrote two different one-shots in the time I've been gone (feel free to check them out, one's Miraculous Ladybug and DP, the other's DP and Transformers: Rescue Bots). And also of course once the block was gone I wrote this chapter in two days. Go figure.</p>\n<p>\n(See the end of the chapter for <a href=\"#chapter_10_endnotes\">more notes</a>.)\n</p>\n<p>Next up! Some more Ghost King Danny, a new POV, and someone knows more about Captain Marvel and Phantom than they're supposed to...<br>Fun Fact! Most spirits born of something without human involvement use it/its pronouns. Like the Leshen, they don't subscribe to the societally enforced binary of humans.<br>Second Fun Fact! There was a scene in this inspired by one of @doodlesforfics drawings for this story! Check it out in the Works Inspired for this story, or on their Tumblr.<br>As always, I love comments and kudos. Feel free to tell me what kind of things you'd like to see more of in the future. Have a great day, and I hope you enjoyed this chapter!</p>\n<p>Hello hello! A little over one month later, and I'm back! This is the last part of the Three Strikes arc, I hope y'all liked it. And a new POV is entering the ring! Wonder how much the resident telepath knows.</p>\n<p>Chapter warning! None, I think. If you think there's something I need to add, put it in the comments and I'll fix it.</p>\n<p>\n(See the end of the chapter for <a href=\"#chapter_11_endnotes\">more notes</a>.)\n</p>\n<p>And that's that! I hope y'all liked it. Up next, I make good on my threats of angst, hurt, and comfort! Danny has a bad time, so it's a good thing his family is there to catch him when he falls.</p>\n<p>If you like my writing, then check out some of my other works! I have a Miraculous Ladybug x Danny Phantom crossover oneshot, as well as a Danny Phantom x Transformers Rescue Bots series with over 31,000 words so far. Please check them out.</p>\n<p>Thank you for reading, and have an awesome day!</p>\n<p>Back again! Perhaps less angst than I promised, and more comfort instead, but I hope you enjoy anyways!<br>Chapter warnings: Some casual mentions of death (canon), rejection by biological parents, and not read through before posting.</p>\n<p>\n(See the end of the chapter for <a href=\"#chapter_12_endnotes\">more notes</a>.)\n</p>\n<p>And there we have it: I am officially all out of ideas. Tell me what you'd like to see next in the comments. Hope you enjoyed this chapter! See you in the new year!<br>Bonus: whose order do you think is whose?</p>\n<p>Hey there! I'm alive! And updating on my birthday! I really loved seeing all of the suggestions you guys gave, but then one that stuck was, drumroll please... Sam and Poison Ivy! Man, that was a lot of exclamation marks in a row. Anyways, there's not content warnings for this chapter, beyond the regular cursing, which you should really know about and expect at this point.<br>Please check out the end notes for some important updates on the future of this fic.<br>I hope you enjoy this chapter!</p>\n<p>\n(See the end of the chapter for <a href=\"#chapter_13_endnotes\">more notes</a>.)\n</p>\n<p>And there we have it! I hope you enjoyed.<br>Now, to get a little bit more serious. I really didn't mean to take this long to update, but a lot of IRL shit happened, none of it good. But in that time, it gave me the opportunity to think about where exactly I'm going with the various stories I've got going on. And the conclusion for this one was, no matter how much I love it on a personal level, I'm just not particularly motivated to write for it.<br>Who's Old Now? is my baby. It's my most popular story, with the most chapters, and the first multi chap that I've ever written. I love it, but I don't feel motivated to write for it. I'm a firm believer that you can tell when a writer loves what they're writing, and I just haven't been feeling that.<br>There is now a firm chapter count. There isn't an end date, because I don't know how long it'll take to write, but this story is coming to a close. The plan is a birthday chapter for Billy and three chapters for The Reveal. One of the most popular suggestions last chapter was The Reveal, but The Reveal was always supposed to be the end point. And, well, we're getting there.<br>This story will be finished, even if it takes me months and months. Hell, if I die IRL I'll possess my computer, just to finish it. I won't leave you hanging. You're all such fantastic readers, and I enjoy every single comment I get, even if I don't reply to most of them (curse you anxiety!).<br>While Who's Old Now? is winding down, I'm still writing in other areas. Check out my other works to see what I'm up to; there's more than one other Danny Phantom crossover.<br>I'll see you back for the future chapters, hopefully. Hope you have a great day!</p>\n<p>Happy Birthday, I sure hope nothing goes wrong! Well, nothing does in this chapter. Next chapter? No promises.</p>\n<p>\n(See the end of the chapter for <a href=\"#chapter_14_endnotes\">more notes</a>.)\n</p>\n<p>Hope you liked this quick little slice of life. I don't know when the next chapter will be out, but it will come eventually. I hope you have an awesome day, and if you like my writing, check out some of the other stories I've done. See you next chapter!</p>\n<p>It's here~. We made it! The reveal! We're slowly getting towards the end. I hope you enjoy this chapter!</p>\n<p>\n(See the end of the chapter for <a href=\"#chapter_15_endnotes\">more notes</a>.)\n</p>\n<p>And that's that! Next chapter's the fallout, and the one after that is the ending/epilogue! I hope y'all enjoyed this chapter, and if you like my writing, check out some of the other stories I've done! I appreciate comments, kudos, extra kudos, questions, rereads, and anything else you're willing to give me. For a more direct line of communication, you can find me @lirabuswavi on Tumblr. Have a great day, and I'll see you for the next chapter.</p>\n<p>Second to last chapter, let's fucking go!<br>Chapter warnings: Swearing, but by this point you should be familiar with it.</p>\n<p>\n(See the end of the chapter for <a href=\"#chapter_16_endnotes\">more notes</a>.)\n</p>\n<p>I love a good dramatic reveal. I love betrayl and breaches of trust in writing, they're great. I've read many 'reveals gone bad' stories. But this story? Isn't one of them. I love drama but I also love understanding. And this is what I wanted it to be! There's hurt, there's worries, there's broken trust, but they're also not taking it out on each other. The point of a meeting is to talk, to listen, to try to understand, not yell or berate. Like was said in this chapter, they know better. Do they have flaws? Blindspots? Of course! Batman's allergic to sharing his thoughts, Superman's bad at handling things when they hit too close to home, Flash sometimes forgets that people don't think as quick as him. They're all people. They all have flaws. But they're also heroes, they chose to be heroes, they chose to hold themselves to a higher standard, and they're going to do their damn best to meet it. So, as much as I love drama and emotionally charged situations... this ain't it. This is rational, intelligent people having a rational, intelligent conversation. And it works!<br>I hope you enjoyed this chapter, there's only one left to go. The formatting for the next one is going to be a little different, if all goes to plan. I love comments, kudos, questions, extra kudos, and whatever you're willing to give me. Have an awesome day, and I'll see you next time for the final chapter.</p>\n<p>Chapter Warnings: None.</p>\n<p>\n(See the end of the chapter for <a href=\"#chapter_17_endnotes\">more notes</a>.)\n</p>\n<p>So that\u2019s the end of things. I\u2019m not quite sure what to say. I\u2019ll start with the facts. This was the first multichapter I started. This will also be the first one I finish. As of writing this, Who\u2019s Old Now is part of 30 collections, has 2,438 comments, 4,017 bookmarks, 15,052 kudos, and 200,113 hits. Even with the numbers laid out in front of me, I\u2019m still in shock. This is far more than I ever thought it\u2019d be.<br>I started this as just a oneshot, a fun little idea cobbled together from a few tidbits on Tumblr that culminated into a fun little scene. I was inspired by @doodleforfics on Tumblr, when they gave me my first ever fanart. I was in the car, and had to pull over in my culdesac I was crying so hard. The first thing I did was send it to my brother, because I was so overwhelmed with all I was feeling. Proud? Honoured? Flattered? So indescribably happy and excited that I was almost late for my appointment? Whatever it was, it was what inspired several scenes in this fic and its overall expansion from a oneshot.<br>So, I guess that this is thank you. Thank you @doodlesforfics for my first ever piece of fanart. Thank you to every person who commented, I read all of them, and I love them. Thank you to the people who commented on every chapter, who binge read and left a comment as you went. I saw them and I love them. Thank you for all the kudos, waking up to a kudos email from AO3 has gotten me through some bad days. Thank you to the people who left ideas that inspired chapters, thank you to the people who told me I made them smile, to the ones who told me I made them cry. Thank you so much.<br>And then this is goodbye. Goodbye to my most popular story. Goodbye to the story I\u2019ve worked on the longest. Goodbye to this labour of love. You\u2019re an important part of who I\u2019ve made myself to be, and I know I\u2019ll grow further. I love you, and I\u2019ll miss you even as I know this ending is for the best. I\u2019m glad I finished this.<br>So, for the last time on Who\u2019s Old Now, thank you for reading. I love comments, kudos, extra kudos, questions and whatever you\u2019re willing to give me. If you like what I\u2019ve done here, check out my account to see what else I\u2019ve done. I have multiple ongoing stories and series. Have a good day and an even better life.<br>Goodbye.</p>",
  "text": "<p align=\"left\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It had started simply, as most complicated things did. It had started with Billy Batson, currently as Captain Marvel, opening his stupid mouth.</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cI know someone.\u201d He said, much to his immediate regret when Batman suddenly zeroed in on him. As well as the rest of the League in the meeting room. When Batman had called a meeting, Marvel hadn\u2019t thought it would be Batman showing an extremely grainy picture of a ghost riding a motorcycle in Gotham and declaring him the newest menace to society. A mysterious being who glowed, and seemed to be entirely impenetrable to attacks. Until Constantine had shown up, complaining and cursing \u2018stupid motherfuckin\u2019 ghosts bothering me, it\u2019s the fuckin\u2019 middle of the night\u2019, and performed an exorcism. Batman was entirely displeased with being caught unawares, especially in his own territory. So, he had come to the League, presenting this new, mysterious threat that had dodged him within his own territory and that he knew practically nothing about. The League had been lamenting their lack of knowledge of this particularly dangerous enemy, before Marvel spoke up.</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Because Marvel, in all his twelve-year-old-masquerading-as-an-adult glory had decided to bring up the one thing, the one <em>person, </em>he didn\u2019t want to bring up in conversation with the League. Batman narrowed his eyes. </p>\n<p align=\"left\">\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cWho.\u201d He growled out. And Marvel, or more honestly Billy in that situation, froze. Because he knew for a fact he could not lie for shit. Any misdirection would be suspicious, and he couldn\u2019t backtrack out of it without giving a reason, and <em>I\u2019m actually a twelve year old masquerading as an adult, and was previously homeless until my current guardian took me in and whenever he transforms into Phantom he looks like he\u2019s fourteen again because he\u2019s a half ghost, but he would also know the most despite retiring from being a vigilante at eighteen and doesn\u2019t want to be brought back into the fold unless it had to do with ghosts, and right now it really did have to do with ghosts, but calling his </em><strike><em>Dad </em></strike><em>guardian to come help was embarrassing. </em>Aaand, he had been silent too long and they were all staring at him. </p>\n<p align=\"left\">\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Marvel breathed out deeply and mustered up both the Courage of Achillese and the Courage of Billy Batson for what was going to come. \u201cI\u2019ll call him,\u201d he said and brought out his communicator.</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cYour League communicator frequency is not to be given out, Captain,\u201d Batman rumbled dangerously.</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cI needed to give it. For emergencies,\u201d Marvel replied. Danny had insisted that Billy have a line to him, even as a League member in case he needed help. \u201c<em>Just because you can do it without help doesn\u2019t mean you should. I\u2019m here for you, kid.\u201d </em>Marvel let Danny\u2019s words ring briefly through his head, words that had been agreed with by Solomon, and dialed Danny\u2019s number into his communicator. He avoided looking up at the Leaguers staring at him, feeling their gazes burn into his head like they all had Superman\u2019s heat vision. When the line connected, he immediately began talking before Danny could get a word out. \u201cHey Phantom! I\u2019m with the League right now. A ghost was causing some trouble in Gotham a little while back, and we were wondering for general information? Whatever you\u2019re willing to give.\u201d He added at the end, knowing Danny kept ghostly information close to his chest when it came to strangers.</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A hissing, static noise erupted from the communicator, and Marvel saw the Leaguers around him jolt in surprise before the static died down into a voice. \u201cSure!\u201d Phantom\u2019s young, static laced voice came through. It never failed to amaze Billy at the difference in Danny and Phantom\u2019s voiced. Danny was an adult, with a job and paid taxes and sent Billy to school, with a low but soft voice. Phantom was light and curious, a voice made to be heard over crowds and chaos. \u201cWhat can I do for ya\u2019?\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Batman leaned closer to Marvel (when the hell did Batman get beside him, what the fuck?) and spoke. \u201cCan you identify a ghost based on the description I\u2019m about to give you?\u201d And\u2026 what? Why was Batman pulling out the less growly nice voice that he used\u2026 for\u2026kids. Oh. The League was probably entirely under the impression Marvel had called a random kid to ask for ghost advice. Shiiit, how was he going to explain his way out of this one?</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cYeah, sure.

He loved <strike>Dad</strike>\u00a0Danny and the way he never treated Billy like a stupid kid. He had parents, and they died. He had foster parents, and they, along with the system, failed him.

Johnny probably just got lucky with the natural portal and felt like causing trouble. That being said, there have been\u2026 misconceptions about ghosts. We\u2019re not inherently bad. The trouble makers are the ones that slip out the most, and given that\u2019s what most people\u2019s experiences are, a lot of people and so called professionals can be.. rather bigoted. Most of us are peaceful. We just want to live our afterlives, alright?\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The League was silent once more. \u201cIn the event this happens again, how can we protect ourselves from malignant,\u201d Batman paused briefly, \u201cghosts?\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201c...Magic works best. Most ghosts just want to cause mischief, not death. We already know what that feels like,\u201d And oh, the League flinched bad at the reminder that they were talking to someone who died, much less what they thought was a dead kid. The only sign of it affecting Batman was the minute tightening of his jaw that Marvel could only see with how close he was. \u201cOther than magic?

He smiled softly and looked up. The smile quickly fell into discomfort at the fact that everyone was staring at him. Marvel looked up at Batman, who was still looming over his shoulder. \u201cCan I\u2026\u201d His gaze flicked back over to the <em>still staring </em>Leaguers, \u201cGo now?\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Superman seemed to blink out of a stupor. \u201cOh, yeah, of course,\u201d he said, \u201cThank you for both you and Phantom\u2019s help.\u201d And here Superman gave him a weird look, one that was weirdly soft and full of awe.</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"left\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cMeeting adjourned,\u201d Batman growled, \u201cIf you encounter any of these ghosts, call in for an available magic user\u2019s assistance.\u201d With that, Batman gave Marvel an inscrutable look before sweeping out of the room. Marvel stood up, deliberately avoiding the eyes of the <em>still staring Leaguers, why were they looking at him like that? </em>So Marvel turned around casually, and walked purposefully to the door. The room was still silent and anxiety prickled at his spine. Why were they all still looking at him?

When he called the wizard\u2019s name and turned back into Billy, it was like his mind was zapped back into him.

Which was how his career as Captain Marvel started as well, so maybe it was a bit auspicious (Sam taught him that word when she taught him about Tarot).\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0Billy didn\u2019t spend a lot of time at the Rock of Eternity. Sure, it was secure, safe, and away from the elements, a big step up from a condemned apartment with doors that didn\u2019t lock and windows that only closed halfway, but there were too many downsides. Time was weird at the Rock. A minute there could be an hour, a day, one time Billy lost a whole week of Earth time. Thank the gods there weren\u2019t any emergencies that Captain Marvel was needed for that week. He did, however, miss a Monitor shift. Any other job wouldn\u2019t accept \u2018unexpected time dilation\u2019 as an actual reason for absence; the Justice League, however, was different. But Billy only spent as much at the Rock of Eternity as he had to. Also, the Rock felt\u2026 weird. Maybe it was all the ancient evil artifacts that were stored here. Maybe it was the Sins\u2019 statues. Maybe it was the Rock itself. Or the fact that the Wizard died here. Or the doorways.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0Doors that lined the walls, some even hiding on floors or the ceilings. Some led to other rooms, like normal doors. Only half of those Billy could reasonably assume were actually at the Rock of Eternity. So many were just\u2026 weird. And with so many back entrances, Billy was constantly revising whether or not the Rock was really safe. Only by virtue of every other magic user Billy had ever met giving him A Look of something between disbelief and terror when he had talked about having access to the Rock of Eternity swayed him back to the idea that it was safe. Constantine himself had replied to Billy, \u201cWhat the absolute fuck, that shit\u2019s supposed to be a myth, and I\u2019ve gone to five different hells, what the fuck kid\u201d.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0So, doors. Half led to rooms. The other half\u2026 apparently led to instances like these?</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0Billy stared at the door that had opened. From the other side. The other person, the man, looked like he wasn\u2019t expecting this either. Billy catalogued the situation, just like Batman had talked about. One person, rather tall, scruffy short black hair, piercing blue eyes, vaguely familiar, and a really odd aura. Matching the swirling green-purple dimension (?) Billy could see behind the man and the door he had just opened. Exit routes. The door behind the man, and the opening to this crevice behind him. It was empty otherwise, precisely the reason Billy chose to store some of his more precious items here.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0Weapons? Magic, of course. But he doubted a picture of his parents and Tawky Tawny the stuffed tiger plush he kept here really counted. So, unknown situation, little to no weapons, what would Batman do?</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u2026Try to learn more about his situation. So Billy took a stabilizing breath, pasted on a smile and said brightly, \u201cHi there! Can I help you with something?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0******</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0For Danny, it started with him wanting to take an Ancients damned break. Sure, he was still only the Heir Apparent to the throne of the <em> entire Infinite Realms </em> so he didn\u2019t have the full workload of <em> High King </em>(it still broke his brain to think about it). And he wouldn\u2019t until he was two hundred and fifty years dead.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0That had been the biggest surprise of his life in a while. At fourteen he wasn\u2019t sure if he\u2019d live until tomorrow or if Skulker would finally do him in. At seventeen, he was counting down the days until his reveal, when he\u2019d finally show himself to his parents, but only after he was a legal adult. At twenty one, spending a good amount of time in the zone, he still expected to have the average lifespan of a human. <strike>He forgot that he was already dead.</strike>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0So, now at twenty seven, just princely duties to attend to, lessons from Clockwork, Pandora, Frostbite, and others to learn, working as a mechanic, checking in on Sam, Tucker, and Jazz in Gotham, checking on Elle at least once a month, and and and\u2026</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0So. Danny wanted a break. From his jobs, from lectures and learning, despite how he did enjoy his time with his mentors and friends, and so many expectations; he hadn\u2019t felt this strangled since being a hero. With both man made portals destroyed, he wasn\u2019t needed anymore. He had never wanted to be a Hero, he just wanted to help. So, at eighteen and moving away to Fawcett City, Phantom hung up the proverbial cape, and retired after four too long years of fighting. So Danny, as his human self, floated through the green and purple swirling landscape.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cPick a door, any door.\u201d He sang under his breath. \u201cIf you pick a place, any place, what challenge will you find?\u201d Danny paused, then shook his head. \u201cIf Ember heard me, she\u2019d <em> definitely </em> hit me over the head with her guitar.\u201d Danny felt a brush of\u2026 something. It was barely there, leaving a strange, electric feeling in his mouth, but it drew his attention anyways. Danny looked to his left and saw a gray door. <em> Was it really a good idea to follow a strange sensation to a random door?...Well he was already dead.\u00a0 </em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0Danny drifted over to it, took an (unnecessary) breath, and opened the door to\u2026\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0A cave. A <em> magic </em> cave, he could taste it in the air. A magic cave with a very startled child. The kid (small, dirty, skinny, <em> too skinny </em>) stared at him. Danny stared back. The kids' eyes started flicking around. Up and down Danny (assessing a threat), behind him, around the small cave (searching for exits), and then at the contents of the cave (looking for weapons). The kid looked back at Danny (too serious, eyes that had seen too much and grown up too fast), took in a breath and smiled (routine, faked, the kind Danny had practiced in front of a mirror before going down to his parents, pretending that he hadn\u2019t died).\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cHi there!\u201d The kid said brightly, \u201cCan I help you with something?\u201d Danny blinked, forcefully rebooted his brain, and smiled back awkwardly..</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cUh, hi to you too. I\u2019m sorry, I just think I\u2019m a bit lost,\u201d Danny glanced over his shoulder, and then back to the kid. \u201cMy name\u2019s Danny. What\u2019s yours?\u201d The kid's shoulders relaxed a bit, and he tilted his head with a slightly more genuine smile. (Like Danny had when meeting a new ghost as Phantom, desperate for an ally, searching for a friend for <em> help- </em>).</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cMy name\u2019s Billy. Glad you didn\u2019t ask for my name.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0Danny laughed and then grinned. \u201cNever had to tangle with the fae before, <em> so </em> glad for that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWhere did you come from?\u201d Billy asked, peering around Danny\u2019s shoulder to the door that was still open.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cOh, that\u2019s the Infinite Realms.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0Billy\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cThe <em> Infinite Realms??! </em> You mean where all the afterlives are, the main connection between timelines!? I heard about that from Zeus and-,\u201d The kid\u2019s mouth snapped shut, the energetic light in his eyes immediately dying at his slip. Danny, in turn, was also panicking.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0The kid reminded him of himself, sue him! And the kid looked like he was working himself into a panic, looking at Danny in fear, looking for an exit, looking at Danny like he was a <em> threat </em>(he hadn\u2019t seen that look since his parents).</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cOh, I know his dad.\u201d Danny internally face palmed. What kind of response was <em> that?? </em> But at least Billy was looking him in the eyes again. Well, also looking at him like he was crazy, but he had been on the receiving end of that look from his friends too often to be discomforted by it.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYou\u2026 know Kronos?\u201d Billy asked with hesitance.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0Danny shrugged. \u201cOne aspect of him, yeah. Not the child eating one, the omniscient Master of Time one.\u201d He corrected himself quickly. Saying he was friendly with a child cannibal was a great way to make enemies. \u201cBut yeah. I talk with Clockwork, that\u2019s the name he prefers,\u201d Danny paused for a moment, a thought occurring to him. \u201cActually the last time we were talking was about the new Champion of Magic, Captain Marvel, who\u2019s apparently\u2026\u201d Danny trailed off, eyes widening.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cApparently what?\u201d Billy asked nervously.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cAn eleven year old,\u201d And before Danny could let Billy work himself into a panic over a blown secret identity, Danny started rambling. \u201cThat\u2019s so cool! I live in Fawcett, actually, and you do a really good job protecting people, and I\u2019ve wanted to thank you before, but I also didn\u2019t want to step on any toes, or draw too much attention to myself as a nonhuman in town.\u201d Danny snapped his mouth shut as he blushed (and it was probably a bit green too, embarrassment transcends dimensions after all).</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0Billy blinked. \u201cOh, you\u2019re Danny the mechanic. I thought you looked familiar, and felt kind of weird when I saw you,\u201d Billy paused, \u201cThat was rude, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d He asked sheepishly.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0Danny, however, just laughed it off. He\u2019d been called worse things than \u2018kind of weird\u2019. \u201cYeah. And I\u2019m sorry for, like, breaking in?\u201d Danny looked around. \u201cI thought there weren\u2019t any cave systems in Fawcett?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cThis isn\u2019t part of Fawcett. It\u2019s\u2026 it\u2019s the Rock of Eternity,\u201d Billy admitted tensely.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cOh, cool,\u201d Danny replied. Billy looked at him weirdly.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201c...I\u2019ll be honest, I was expecting more of a reaction,\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0Danny grinned, \u201cI see a lot of weird shit,\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cAren\u2019t you not supposed to curse around children?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI saw you get pile drived into a road last week. Old enough to fight for your life, old enough to curse how you like.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0Billy gave a sharp grin, the most natural smile Danny had seen on him yet. \u201cAw, fuck yeah. I can\u2019t curse as Marvel, that would be giving a bad impression. Gotta keep my \u2018Boy Scout to Rival Superman\u2019 title,\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0Danny laughed. It felt nice. \u201cAlright then, boy scout. Sorry for breaking into your Marvel Cave. Can I treat you to lunch as sorry? On me, of course.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0The scrutinising look was back on Billy. The assessment of threat, if the offer was genuine, if an adult would hurt him <em> again </em> (who had failed this child? Danny knew who failed himself, who hurt him, who made him scared to ever trust any adult when he had been hugged with one arm and stabbed with another). So Danny just adjusted his grin, into something a bit more playful, a bit more goofy.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s the least I can do. Call it an exchange for not calling the magic police on me,\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cThe magic police?\u201d Billy snorted.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYeah, for my magic breaking and entering onto magic private property.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0Billy laughed. \u201cI hate to break it to you, but,\u201d Billy planted his fists on his hips and widened his stance, \u201c<em> I </em>am the magic police,\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cAn officer of the magic law! Can I make like Gotham and bribe you, officer?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWhatcha offerin\u2019?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cAll you can eat at Sally\u2019s Diner, full expenses paid,\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cIncluding desert?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cAw, officer, you drive a hard bargain. But yes, including desert. We have a deal?\u201d Danny reached out his hand to Billy. And Billy hesitated, looking from the outstretched hand and then to Danny\u2019s face. He hoped his eyes were telling what words couldn\u2019t. <em> I\u2019ve been there </em> and <em> I\u2019m going to help, it\u2019s okay </em> and maybe even <em> I\u2019ll take care of you </em>. Whatever it was the Billy saw, he seemed to find it acceptable, as he reached up to grasp Danny\u2019s hand, to accept help.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYou\u2019ve got a deal,\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 *****How it\u2019s Going*****</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cBilly, wake up! You don\u2019t want to be late for morning patrol!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0Billy groaned and buried his head beneath his pillow.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cCome on Champ, can\u2019t put it off forever.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0Billy pulled the pillow off his face. \u201cI have an alarm!\u201d He shouted, \u201cFor after you leave, it\u2019s fucking eight in the morning! I got back from evening patrol at one!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYou were supposed to be back at midnight!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI got called in to fight a mage in a different time zone! High noon is apparently a relative to magic.\u201d There was a knock at his door. \u201cCome in,\u201d he sighed. Danny entered, dressed for work.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cAlright. I understand. Bad guys have no respect for sleep schedules,\u201d Danny ruffled Billy\u2019s hair. \u201cThis is why you\u2019re homeschooled too,\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0Billy sighed. \u201cThanks Danny,\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cAnytime, kiddo. Anytime.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201c</span>\n<span>Marvel, stay after. I\u2019d like to\u2026 </span>\n<em>\n<span>speak </span>\n</em>\n<span>with you,\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Captain Marvel stared. Batman wanted him to stay after. With him. In private. For a </span>\n<em>\n<span>conversation.</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOoh, someone\u2019s in trouble~\u201d Hal snickered. The Captain agreed. Had he been found out? Would Batman stare him in the face and call him Billy? Or would he bring up Danny!? Recite his address and see how he reacted??! Batman was silent. And also glaring at Hal, </span>\n<em>\n<span>hard.</span>\n</em>\n<span> Hal put up his hands.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cGoing, going!\u201d Hal said, \u201cIt was nice knowing you, Cap,\u201d He wandered out of the meeting room. Superman nodded to both Marvel and Batman before exiting, Cyborg concilatorally patted his shoulder, and he got more than one piteous or curious look.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>So now Billy was alone. With Batman. Staring at each other. In silence.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<span>Avert eye contact, it\u2019s a challenge to predators,</span>\n</em>\n<span> Solomon advised. Very unhelpfully, Billy might add.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cFollow me,\u201d Batman growled.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<span>Secondary location, getting taken to a secondary location by a scary adult! </span>\n</em>\n<span>The part of his mind that still lived on the streets whispered as Marvel followed behind Batman. Okay, no, all parts of his brain including various gods needed to be quiet. What would Danny do? For one, stay calm. Two, it was Batman. He was trusted. And Billy could leave. Say no. He had the body and the privileges of an adult. And they were still in the Watchtower. Sure, they were walking to a little used part, that Billy knew nothing about, and mind control existed, and nanobots, and shapeshifters, and </span>\n<em>\n<span>Billy needed to calm the fuck down.\u00a0</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Batman turned abruptly and opened a door to\u2026 a cozy looking common room? There was a little kitchenette to the side, and a pair of soft green couches facing each other over a low coffee table. The part that took Billy\u2019s breath away and dimmed his fears was the large window that stretched wall to ceiling, open to the gorgeous view of Earth. He never got over how beautiful it was to see the view from space. To look down and </span>\n<em>\n<span>know </span>\n</em>\n<span>that he was protecting each and every life. A small part of something bigger. It stirred something weird in his chest, an emotion that felt too big for a twelve year old to comprehend or contain.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cMarvel,\u201d Batman growled, immediately calling attention back to him. Marvel snapped his head over and waited for Batman to speak. And waited. And then waited a little bit more. Had Batman stopped breathing? Marvel didn\u2019t think he\u2019d seen Batman move since they entered the room. Wait, no, there was\u2026 a minute tightening of his fist. Not in a </span>\n<em>\n<span>I\u2019m gonna hit you way </span>\n</em>\n<span>but, a\u2026 nervous way? A nervous tick? There was no way. No way at all that Batman was </span>\n<em>\n<span>nervous </span>\n</em>\n<span>for a conversation with </span>\n<em>\n<span>him. </span>\n</em>\n<span>So Batman wouldn\u2019t take the first steps. That\u2019s okay. Marvel could do it instead.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Marvel took the initiative and sat down on one of the couches, the one facing the kitchenette. He gave Batman what he hoped was a disarming smile. \u201cLet\u2019s sit down. I\u2019m nervous enough already,\u201d There, the ball was in Batman\u2019s court. An admission of vulnerability, putting control back in Batman\u2019s hands.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Batman swept over silently, and sat on the opposite couch with catlike grace.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIs there something in particular you\u2019d like to talk about?\u201d Marvel asked in what he hoped was a soft tone (that maybe he was mimicking from Danny. Just a little bit). That, however, just made Batman </span>\n<em>\n<span>sigh, </span>\n</em>\n<span>in the most world weary voice Marvel had ever heard from him, and put his head in his hands. Marvel waited for Batman to say something, and eventually with a deep breath in, he spoke.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cMarvel. I am going to be\u2026 </span>\n<em>\n<span>honest </span>\n</em>\n<span>with you. This is going to be\u2026 difficult for me. I am trusting you with this,\u201d And Marvel was struck dumb. Batman was trusting him? Batman was going to be </span>\n<em>\n<span>honest?? </span>\n</em>\n<span>Mister enigma wrapped in a riddle with a side of a red herring clue??! But before the Captain could say anything, Batman continued. \u201cI have decided you might be one of the best people to talk to this about,\u201d Batman\u2019s voice was less growly, what was going on?! \u201cMy son died. And he came back. How do you\u2026 manage?\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Oh no. </span>\n<em>\n<span>Oh no. </span>\n</em>\n<span>This was coming back to bite him so bad. He wasn\u2019t the dad of a kid that had died, he was just\u2026 Billy! Marvel lowered his eyes. He couldn\u2019t come clean now! That would be so awkward! So just\u2026 honesty. Lies of omission. He could do this. He could.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI\u2026 didn\u2019t know him, before he died. He\u2019s always been like this to me. It\u2019s,\u201d and here his voice warbled, \u201cTerrifying to think I might have never even met him,\u201d It raised an aching pressure in his chest to even verbalize the thought that he\u2019s had before, and Marvel lifted his watering eyes to Batman\u2019s face, \u201cI have to tell myself that I\u2019d know </span>\n<em>\n<span>something </span>\n</em>\n<span>was missing. Phantom\u2019s presence in my life was something I knew I wanted, from the moment I first realized what he meant to me. And what I meant to him. And not knowing him? Knowing that something was missing, but never who? That\u2026 terrifies me. So much. That he could have stayed dead, and I wouldn\u2019t have my only family,\u201d Marvel choked on his breath and wiped lightly at his eyes. \u201cI manage by reassuring myself that he </span>\n<em>\n<span>is </span>\n</em>\n<span>here. He may have been hurt. Horribly. And that he didn\u2019t have to come back. But he did. And in his own way, he stayed,\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Batman stared at him silently. Then nodded, slowly. \u201cI\u2026 appreciate your candidacy on the subject. My son came back, so full of anger. I\u2019ve tried, but I don\u2019t know how I can truly help him.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Okay, continuing with the advice train. How to help with someone full of anger. He couldn\u2019t do it from a parents perspective, he could do </span>\n<em>\n<span>none of it </span>\n</em>\n<span>the way Batman wanted. But\u2026 he knew what it was like to be a kid. Hurt and alone and angry. Even if Billy had hidden it well behind the polite smiles that got grannies to give him little bits of candy and dollars for being \u2018such a nice young man\u2019. He knew what it was like, to be a kid full of complicated emotions and not knowing what to do with them. So he couldn\u2019t give parenting advice. But he can say what he would\u2019ve wanted, to be told or how to be treated in that situation.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAnger is part of grief, you know. It\u2019s okay that he\u2019s angry. With you, or himself, or with the world that killed him. It\u2019s okay that he\u2019s angry, and telling him he shouldn\u2019t be is one of the most counterproductive things you can do. He\u2019s hurting, but also,\u201d Marvel made direct eye contact with Batman, \u201cYou\u2019re there for him and that\u2019s the most important thing you can do. Making sure he knows you have his back. Not just for vigilante things, but for everything. If he\u2019s still legally dead, help him how he wants to deal with that. Fake identities, or resurrect his civilian one. Weirder things have happened in this world, there have been mass resurrections before. Easy enough to say he was brought back in one of those. And maybe encourage him to try online school, for whatever stage he\u2019s at or missed. Ask about his hobbies, listen to him. For anything. Don\u2019t make your relationship </span>\n<em>\n<span>professional</span>\n</em>\n<span>,\u201d Marvel couldn\u2019t help but spit that out, the social workers that looked at him as nothing but a job flashing through his mind briefly. \u201cHe\u2019s your son. And you\u2019re his dad. That\u2019s the most important thing, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Batman looked at Marvel. \u201cIt is,\u201d he said quietly, and then with more conviction, \u201cIt is,\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Marvel couldn\u2019t help but think that this was Batman without a mask. Not literally, he was still </span>\n<em>\n<span>Batman</span>\n</em>\n<span>, but the lack of growl in his voice, the absence of a pronounced frown, a casual posture that spoke more of a man than a myth.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI can\u2019t say it\u2019ll be easy. For you or him. There will be, and probably already have been, ups and downs. Just stay focused on the core of these feelings. What is that to you?\u201d Billy wanted to take it back as soon as he said it. You don\u2019t </span>\n<em>\n<span>ask </span>\n</em>\n<span>about Batman\u2019s </span>\n<em>\n<span>feelings</span>\n</em>\n<span>! That\u2019s nuts! But Batman just looked at Marvel, and replied,</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThat I love him,\u201d and there was quiet. Not the stifling quiet that had driven Marvel to speak first, but a considering quiet. And Billy took this moment to think. Where would he be, if Danny had stayed dead at fourteen? Billy would never know. Never know that his </span>\n<strike>\n<span>Dad</span>\n</strike>\n<span> guardian that he loved had died in agony as a child. It threatened to steal his breath just thinking about it.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>But that was in the past. And he couldn\u2019t do anything about it. Simply accept what it was, and be grateful for what he had. A home. A stable source of food and comfort. A family, in Danny, Jazz, Elle, Sam, and Tucker.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Batman stood suddenly, startling Billy out of his thoughts. \u201cThank you for your time, Captain,\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThank you for letting me help,\u201d Marvel replied.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>********</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Danny was tilting the skillet in his hand when he heard Billy come in.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHey Billy! Hope you like pan fried chicken. It\u2019ll probably be bland, I need to run out for more spices, and-\u201d Danny cut off when he felt little arms encircle his waist. He set the pan down and turned down the heat of the stove. \u201cEverything alright, Billy? Did something happen?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNo,\u201d Billy\u2019s voice came muffled from where it was buried in Danny\u2019s shirt, \u201cJust happy you\u2019re here,\u201d Danny paused, wondered briefly how this could have come up, then shrugged it off.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI\u2019m happy you\u2019re here too,\u201d Danny replied, ruffling Billy\u2019s hair, \u201cAlways happy to have you,\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>*****</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cJason,\u201d Bruce called. Jason stopped and sighed before turning around. It was a quiet night, he had worked with Timber perfectly civilly, and had barely shot anyone with his rubber bullets. A Batman approved evening, what could he be in trouble for </span>\n<em>\n<span>now?</span>\n</em>\n<span>\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhat, old man? I stuck to all the rules, and I\u2019d like to get some sleep tonight. I may have died, but I still got a life,\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Instead of the usual flinch when Jason mentioned his death, Bruce simply pulled back his cowl and looked at him with an unidentifiable emotion. \u201cI have something I want to show you,\u201d Oh, a case. Jason could work with that. Red Hood and Batman had established rules. Jason and Bruce\u2026 well, despite not being related by blood, avoiding emotions ran in the family. Jason sauntered over to Bruce by the Batcomputer and looked over his shoulder. It was\u2026 a fake ID with his face on it. A </span>\n<em>\n<span>good </span>\n</em>\n<span>fake ID. And his death records. A list of John Does, the last mass resurrection because death didn\u2019t even always stick for civilians when the laws of the universe were fucked with regularly, applications for online colleges\u2026</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cDo you need me to go undercover, or something Bruce?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>A brief silence. Jason looked at Bruce\u2019s bare face, and the way he was avoiding Jason\u2019s eyes. Fuck, he jinxed it. Bruce wanted to talk about </span>\n<em>\n<span>emotions</span>\n</em>\n<span>. Why the fuck would Bruce gather the courage to do that now?</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201c...You enjoyed school, while you went,\u201d Oh shit, they were talking about </span>\n<em>\n<span>before, </span>\n</em>\n<span>Bruce never brought that up, \u201cAnd you\u2019ve helped Tim, Damian, and Duke more than once when they asked for your opinion on classic books. If you wanted to get a GED, then try online classes, I want to\u2026 support you in that,\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Jason\u2019s eyes flicked back over the screens, rolling implications around in his head. A fake civilian ID, to have a legal identity. His death record, and\u2026 mass resurrections. \u201cYou want to bring me </span>\n<em>\n<span>back?</span>\n</em>\n<span>\u201d Jason asked incredulously. \u201cLittle Jason Todd, son of Bruce Wayne? I\u2019m not that kid Bruce, and you can\u2019t make me be-,\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI don\u2019t want you to be,\u201d and for some reason the words stung something deep within Jason, \u201cI want you to be as you are. I can\u2019t change you,\u201d And here Bruce made eye contact for the first time in this conversation, \u201cNor do I want to. You can take the fake ID, or the resurrection, or neither. It-it doesn\u2019t matter to me what\u2019s changed, because no matter what, you\u2019re my son,\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Jason had no reply. He was blue screening. Because, what?? Bruce had an emotionally competent conversation, and he was </span>\n<em>\n<span>accepting </span>\n</em>\n<span>Jason, after all he\u2019s said and done?! Bruce still thought of him as\u2026 his son? So he made like a </span>\n<em>\n<span>normal emotionally constipated person trained by Batman </span>\n</em>\n<span>and walked away.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNope. Too tired to deal with this tonight. I\u2019m out,\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cTake as much time as you need, Jaylad,\u201d And Jason </span>\n<em>\n<span>did not </span>\n</em>\n<span>choke back a lump in his throat at the old, affectionate nickname. Jason simply reached his bike and slung his leg over it. Then paused.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhat\u2019s Alfred making for breakfast?\u201d Jason asked, sounding far more unsure than he would have liked.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cTurnovers, I believe. Duke did well on his last test, so he got to pick breakfast,\u201d Bruce replied, eyes glittering far too much for Jason\u2019s taste.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201c...Alfred makes good turnovers. I\u2019ll be back to take your food. And </span>\n<em>\n<span>maybe </span>\n</em>\n<span>we can talk about college,\u201d He had wanted to go to college. He had loved school. Bruce wanted him to have a legal ID, to be able to get his GED, go to college, simply because\u2026 Jason enjoyed it. Because Jason wanted to. Because Bruce still, after all this time, thought of Jason as his son. \u201cWho\u2019d you get your advice from on this?\u201d Jason asked, and Bruce didn\u2019t do him the disservice of lying. It would have been a very obvious lie, someone talked to Bruce about this. Dick, maybe? Alfred?</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cCaptain Marvel,\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThe Big Red Cheese?\u201d Jason asked incredulously. \u201cYou asked for advice from a magic user on the Justice League who you don\u2019t know the identity of?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI know enough,\u201d Bruce said mysteriously, with the glint in his eye that said he was teasing, as much as the man behind Batman ever could.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAlright then, keep your secrets,\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cSafe travel Frodo,\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIn the book, it\u2019s actually Gandalf that says it. I see I\u2019m going to need to educate you troglodytes,\u201d Jason sniffed. \u201cSee you later, B,\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cSee you later, Jaylad,\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>As Jason roared down the tunnel out of the Batcave on his motorcycle, his mind was spinning with a lot of things. But what came out on top was, </span>\n<em>\n<span>he should probably hit up his favorite undead mechanic. He could maybe thank Marvel while he was there too.</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAnd then, </span>\n<em>\n<span>and then- </span>\n</em>\n<span>socket wrench, thank you- he says that no matter what, I\u2019m his son! Bruce doesn\u2019t get mushy, but we have it! On video! It\u2019s a miracle, Danny,\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cSome people just need a push. Or twenty. Pressure gauge, thanks Jay. But actual, emotionally competent conversation. Do you know what spurred this on?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Jason looked up at Danny over his motorcycle, grease smeared on his cheek and a smile on his face. \u201cApparently I have Captain Marvel to thank for that. The Captain\u2019s getting pretty high up on my favorite hero list,\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Danny gave a teasing grin, \u201cBut never above Wonder Woman,\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNever. Speaking of Amazonian goddesses, how\u2019s your sister?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou two live in the same city, man. You could check in on her if you wanted,\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cBeen busy this past week. First, B drops an emotionally competent conversation on me, then I can\u2019t even do anything about it because there was a fucking mass breakout at Arkham, so it\u2019s been all hands on deck for the past week!\u201d Jason threw up his hands, wrench going dangerously close to Danny\u2019s face. Well, dangerous if he was an average human. \u201cJust finally got out here to talk to you and get a check in on my bike. And I can\u2019t even swing by for dinner or to see Billy,\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOh?\u201d Danny perked up, \u201cWhat do you have going on?\u201d Jason rolled his eyes.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201c\u2018Parently it\u2019s \u2018bring your kid to work day\u2019 in the Justice League. B\u2019s dragging me and the demon child along. I\u2019m only going because I can meet Wonder Woman, I\u2019ll have you know,\u201d Jason wagged his wrench at Danny\u2019s smirking face, \u201cNo other family bonding reason or whatever you\u2019re cooking up,\u201d Danny\u2019s face broke into an unsettlingly wide, sharp, grin.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOh, I\u2019ve got a plan cooking up. You wouldn\u2019t be able to come to dinner tonight anyways, I now have\u2026 an alternate plan,\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Jason deadpanned at Danny. \u201cIf I didn\u2019t know you\u2019re a fellow undead vigilante, I\u2019d be far more concerned by that. Do I want to know?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cFormer vigilante. And you\u2019ll find out soon enough. I wouldn\u2019t want to ruin the surprise,\u201d Danny chuckled in a way Jason could only define as somewhere between \u2018mischievous\u2019 and \u2018menacing\u2019.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHow do you think Billy\u2019s going to feel about your mysterious \u2018plan\u2019?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Danny\u2019s grin stretched from \u2018vaguely inhuman\u2019 to \u2018edging on eldritch abomination territory\u2019. \u201cIt\u2019s every parents job to embarrass their kid at least once,\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>********</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>The moment Billy walked into the apartment, something in his brain began screaming \u2018predator\u2019. This did not alarm him as much as it probably should have. The last time he had felt this, it had been when he walked in on Danny and Elle having a staredown over what kind of seasoning to use on the chicken. (Elle argued for some burn your face off spices she had brought from her latest travel, while Danny argued for something more mild, </span>\n<em>\n<span>he grew up in the midwest for fucks sake. </span>\n</em>\n<span>Elle won. Billy enjoyed dinner. Danny did not.) Before that it had been Danny staring down a floating eyeball ghost in the living room before telling them to fuck off. So Billy wasn\u2019t concerned. Until he walked in to see the unholy, impish light glowing off of Danny in his Phantom form.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201c</span>\n<em>\n<span>Biiillllyyy~\u201d </span>\n</em>\n<span>Danny sang in a way that made the hairs on the back of his neck stand up. \u201cYou didn\u2019t tell me there was a bring your kids to work day event!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Static electricity prickled at the back of his neck, and Zeus needed to </span>\n<em>\n<span>stop laughing.</span>\n</em>\n<span> Okay, play it cool. Do not indulge in mischief. \u201cIs there? I hadn\u2019t heard,\u201d He didn\u2019t talk like that, that was just suspicious.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cToo late, Jason told me! And </span>\n<em>\n<span>I </span>\n</em>\n<span>want to meet your coworkers,\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNo way, are you nuts!? We could get caught!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cFor what?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cLying about our ages!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHey, we never told them how old we were, it\u2019s their fault for assuming based on appearances,\u201d Billy leveled a flat look at Danny floating serenely. \u201cYeah, yeah, lie of omission and all that. But it\u2019d be so fun! I want to meet your coworkers, and it\u2019s a </span>\n<em>\n<span>space station </span>\n</em>\n<span>Billy,\u201d Danny said as if that were all the explanation that was needed. Which, given Danny\u2019s fascination with space, was an explanation in its own way.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWe barely managed a conversation on a call, how could we keep it up for an </span>\n<em>\n<span>entire evening </span>\n</em>\n<span>in front of the </span>\n<em>\n<span>Justice League.</span>\n</em>\n<span> Including their kids!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cDo they know you\u2019re human?\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Billy rolled with the change in topic, as both he and Danny had had these kinds of arguments before. \u201cNo,\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThen how should they know how you\u2019re supposed to raise your kid? I\u2019m a different species, we could have different milestones, or concepts of caretakers. You\u2019re a </span>\n<em>\n<span>demigod, </span>\n</em>\n<span>Billy. They can\u2019t tell you how to parent your \u2018kid\u2019. And if they do try, you can tell them off! Win-win,\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cBut I\u2019d be </span>\n<em>\n<span>lying, </span>\n</em>\n<span>even more, even worse! I don\u2019t\u2026 I know I\u2019m always doing it to them, but I don\u2019t like lying. I don\u2019t want to hurt them,\u201d Billy wilted and looked down at the floor. A cold presence announced Danny getting closer.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHey. I didn\u2019t want to pressure you. You don\u2019t want to go, we won\u2019t! I think it\u2019d be a fun type of prank, but if it isn\u2019t fun to you, then I won\u2019t,\u201d Billy lifted his face to Danny\u2019s gentle smile, \u201cThe choice is always yours, kiddo. I didn\u2019t mean to stress you out.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Billy slumped forward into Danny, and felt small, cold arms wrap around him. Even when Danny was the size of a teenager and wrapping around him like a gaseous snake, Billy felt comforted. \u201cI think,\u201d Billy mumbled into Danny\u2019s hazmat suit, \u201cThat it would be like, </span>\n<em>\n<span>so funny. </span>\n</em>\n<span>But I don\u2019t want to do it if I feel worse about doing it than it makes me happy,\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThanks for telling me. We won\u2019t if you don\u2019t want to. We can make Mac and Cheese and watch a movie before you go out on patrol, or whatever you feel like,\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Billy weighed his options. He could stay home. Maintain status quo. Or he could take a risk. Risk his identity. Risk Danny\u2019s. But he could take Danny up to the Watchtower. Show him the stars, and what he does, and his coworkers and the people he considers friends. \u201c...Will Jason be there?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYup! And his youngest sibling,\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cDo you think he\u2019ll go with it?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHe\u2019s always in favour of pulling one over people. He\u2019ll keep my secret,\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201c...Alright. Let\u2019s do it,\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>**********</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>When Jason choked on his drink, the only one to notice was the Demon Brat. \u201cTt. What is your malfunction, Hood?\u201d But even with the disparaging comment, Jason could tell Damian was sweeping the room with his eyes. It was a standard kind of \u2018party\u2019 set up. Snack table, with sealed and unsealed foods and speedster snacks in between, drink table, also with seal and unsealed options, and various League members and their proteges scattered around. Jason pegged the exact moment Damian saw what Jason was looking at. \u201cHm. I was unaware Captain Marvel had spawned,\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Jason said nothing and continued to stare. Because Captain Marvel had not \u2018spawned\u2019, \u2018sired\u2019, or \u2018produced\u2019 or any other weirdly formal word Damian would use. That was Danny. In his Phantom form, hovering around the Captain and generally acting like a giddy kid in a space station full of heroes.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThat\u2019s Phantom,\u201d Batman said from behind them, and Jason </span>\n<em>\n<span>did not </span>\n</em>\n<span>jump at his reappearance from wherever the hell The Batman disappeared to during parties, \u201cHe\u2019s Marvel\u2019s adopted child. He\u2019s a ghost,\u201d And then the old man glided over in the direction of Marvel and Phantom who were quickly gaining attention, with his Robin trailing at his heels.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Jason was frozen in some form of shock. Some part of his brain decided to hysterically remind him of the first time Danny had introduced him to his friends and sister.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<span>\u201cTwo truths and a lie?\u201d Jason had asked incredulously.</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<span>\u201cYup,\u201d Sam had replied.</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<span>\u201cWith the wacky shit that happens to us, we can have the fucking coolest games,\u201d Tucker had said, waving half of a circuit board around, \u201cBut since we were all there for it, we can only play it when someone else is brought into the know, which isn\u2019t often,\u201d</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<span>\u201cI\u2019ll go first,\u201d Danny replied, \u201cWe\u2019re unsure of how many times I\u2019ve died, I\u2019m ghost royalty, and I can quote a good third of Pride and Prejudice,\u201d</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<span>Spoiler alert: Jason lost a lot. But he did get them with \u2018an assassin cult leader has possession of my brother\u2019s left kidney\u2019 lie. Tim had lost his spleen, not his kidney.\u00a0</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>That had been almost half a year ago, and it seemed Bruce wanted to play too. Truth: that was Phantom. Truth: he\u2019s a ghost. Lie: he\u2019s Captain Marvel\u2019s kid.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>What. The. Fuck.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>And then, that little shit made eye contact from across the room, hanging over Marvel\u2019s shoulder like the undead schrodinger's ghost cat he was, and winked.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Well. Jason supposed pretending to be Captain Marvel\u2019s kid in front of the Justice League would be embarrassing to Billy. Jason saluted back to Danny. </span>\n<em>\n<span>Godspeed, you bastard</span>\n</em>\n<span>, Jason thought at Danny. Phantom\u2019s sharp toothed grin widened.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>*******</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Barry couldn\u2019t believe it. He couldn\u2019t believe it when he had first heard the call. Or when the Zeta had called out that Captain Marvel was here, along with a guest. </span>\n<em>\n<span>But what did he know?</span>\n</em>\n<span> Because that was a teenager literally hovering around Marvel, smiling at Diana and saying </span>\n<em>\n<span>how lovely it was to meet her, Pandora sends her well wishes, and the Master of Time approves of her actions, and oh of course he knows gods, he lives with Captain Marvel after all.\u00a0</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cClose your mouth, Flash, you might accidentally eat Atom,\u201d Black Canary teased as she came up beside him at the snack table to watch the show. Said show currently being Diana offering Phantom sword lessons, and Phantom looking to Marvel with puppy eyes while the Captain looked somewhere between uncomfortable and exasperated. Rather like how Barry had felt when Wally had asked him permission to train with the Bats during his Kid Flash days, \u2018</span>\n<em>\n<span>Rob had offered after all\u2019. </span>\n</em>\n<span>These thoughts zipped through his mind in less than a second before he replied to Dinah.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cVery funny, but Atom\u2019s not here. And you can\u2019t say you\u2019re not tempted. Did you ever think that Cap would be a </span>\n<em>\n<span>dad?</span>\n</em>\n<span>\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cStranger things have happened,\u201d Dinah replied with a little smirk, \u201cAnd from what I\u2019ve seen, the Captain\u2019s doing a perfectly fine job,\u201d Her smirk melted into a little smile. \u201cHave you ever seen him this honestly happy?\u201d Barry wanted to argue. Marvel gaves Supes a run for his boy scout title. The dude always smiled, he was so chipper and genuine in his enthusiasm to be part of the Justice League, to </span>\n<em>\n<span>help people.</span>\n</em>\n<span> But Barry kept his mouth shut, and looked like Dinah said.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Looked at how Marvel\u2019s thousand watt smile was smaller, softer, content. Looked at how his bright eyes dulled to less like the sun, but a cozy fireplace at home. Looked at how his broad shoulders were slumped, like a tension he had been carrying was lightened simply by being near Phantom and his casual chatter. He looked at Captain Marvel, and Barry thought he finally understood Marvel\u2019s \u2018World\u2019s Mightiest Mortal\u2019 title. He didn\u2019t look like a demigod, larger than life and brimming with confidence and power. He looked like a man. A man simply happy to be with his family.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHe\u2026 Yeah, he looks happy. Really happy- oh shit he\u2019s coming this way,\u201d Barry replied before cutting himself off. Marvel and his kid seemed to be tired of getting stuck in conversations at the door and were coming over in their direction. Barry had never seen someone fly like Phantom did. There was a grace, a fluidness, like all gravity was artificial and optional to Phantom. So sue him if he jumped a little when Phantom slid past him to grab at something on the snack table.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHi Black Canary, Flash,\u201d The kid greeted, holding onto his prize. But Barry noticed something on the packaging.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHey kid. I don\u2019t think you want to eat that, it\u2019s for speedster metabolisms. Don\u2019t want you to get sick,\u201d Barry said with a light grin.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d Phantom said, waving him off and unwrapping the healthy carbohydrate filled cookie. Barry flashed a look up to Marvel, waiting for him to say something. But then the Captain crossed his arms and raised his eyebrows in a challenging manner. The look took Barry aback a bit, but, well, when someone questioned whether it was \u2018actually healthy\u2019 for Wally to eat as much as he did Barry probably gave that kind of Look too. The, \u2018You heard him\u2019 Look. Barry didn\u2019t press any further.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou got a big metabolism too?\u201d Barry asked instead.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYup. Helps to compensate when I can\u2019t get enough ectoplasm,\u201d Barry had no clue what that was, but let it go. Phantom\u2019s face screwed up into a contemplative look and he looked over to Marvel (not up, Phantom hovered at the same height as Marvel). \u201cHey, do you think Phantasm could some of these? So she doesn\u2019t have to take as many ectoplasm supplements when traveling?\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Before the Captain could reply, Barry blurted out, \u201cWait, you\u2019ve got more family?\u201d Marvel just stared at Barry before looking over to Phantom. Phantom, in return, nodded as if giving permission.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYeah. She goes by Phantasm. She enjoys traveling, so she isn\u2019t home often,\u201d Marvel answered.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOlder sister?\u201d Canary questioned, and Barry almost jumped. He had almost forgotten she was there.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNah. Clone. But we prefer little sister,\u201d Phantom replied casually, biting into his cookie as if he hadn\u2019t just dropped a metaphorical bomb into the conversation. Because Superman had been approaching and had frozen at hearing the \u2018c\u2019 word. </span>\n<em>\n<span>Walk away, walk away, walk away, </span>\n</em>\n<span>Barry chanted internally. While Supes and Conner had a better relationship now, it was still rocky; Superman always hung up on the clone thing and Conner being unhappy with his rejection. Which, fair. But that wasn\u2019t Barry\u2019s business. It was Batman\u2019s self appointed job to deal with that mess, because he had no fear of an angry kryptonian. But no. Nope. They were not that lucky. Superman was approaching even quicker, and both Barry and Canary (hah that rhymed) were trapped up against the snack table. (And also trapped by societal convention, but that was besides the point.)</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cClone?\u201d Superman asked with an agitated tone. Phantom turned to look at Superman with narrowed eyes.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYes, I love her very much. That\u2019s not an issue, right?\u201d Phantom\u2019s tone was perfectly placid, but Barry could swear there was more of a chill in the room than there was before. But for some reason, Superman relaxed slightly.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOh, you chose to have her?\u201d He asked innocently. It was however definitely the wrong thing to say. In addition to the chill in the air, there was now static electricity prickling along Barry\u2019s arms. He looked over to Canary with wide eyes, but she just made a calm gesture and continued to watch the superpowered train wreck of a conversation.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhat does that have to do with loving her?\u201d The Captain asked with a hostile tone Barry had never heard from him before. Marvel didn\u2019t even talk to his villains like this, always speaking with compassion and reaching a hand out before even making a fist. It was something Barry had always admired about the Captain before. But Superman had somehow found the breaking point on a good man: defending his family.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Superman blinked and looked surprised (and vaguely unsettled). \u201cOh, I just assumed-\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou assumed that she had to be made with my knowledge and willingness to love her? She didn\u2019t ask to be made,\u201d Phantom fired off, ghostly tail flicking with what Barry could think of as agitation. The room was quieting, attention drawn by the two most non-confrontational yet powerful members of the League staring each other down, with an angry teenager hovering over Marvel\u2019s shoulder.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIs this why Superboy doesn\u2019t live with you?\u201d Marvel demanded. \u201cYou rejected him when he came to you in need?\u201d The Captain was full on glaring, and Barry was tempted to crawl under the table to avoid this confrontation. Ozone was wafting through the air, frost spiralling on Marvel\u2019s shoulder where Phantom hovered. (Superman looked scared.)</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI didn\u2019t-\u201d Superman protested, \u201cHe- I didn\u2019t know he was made! He was made by my biggest enemy to replace me, of course I was alarmed!\u201d </span>\n<em>\n<span>Wrong move, </span>\n</em>\n<span>Barry thought hysterically as what sounded like lightning cracked out in the now dead silent room, </span>\n<em>\n<span>wrong move, wrong move!\u00a0</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHe was a scared child, and he needed you. And you rejected him? </span>\n<em>\n<span>You call yourself a hero?</span>\n</em>\n<span>\u201d Marvel rumbled. Barry had seen Marvel in many different ways. In awe of the heroes he found himself joining two years ago, compassion and determination during fights and saving people, battling forces of nature. Barry thought he knew what Marvel looked like as a demigod. He was wrong. </span>\n<em>\n<span>This was a demigod. </span>\n</em>\n<span>Ozone in the air, danger prickling on his spine, the air pulled out of his lungs, the overwhelming feeling of someone bigger, stronger, </span>\n<em>\n<span>angry </span>\n</em>\n<span>in the room. Barry felt like he was staring up a mountain, knowing he would never truly understand how it came to be, how it experienced existence, what it had </span>\n<em>\n<span>seen-</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI\u2019m going to pull a Batman,\u201d The young voice cut through the fog in Barry\u2019s mind, and he felt like he could finally breathe. He looked up at Phantom (when had he looked down?) who was now firmly ignoring Superman and was instead looking at Marvel. Marvel cut a confused look over to Phantom, the tension in the room cutting down another notch as Marvel started looking less hostile (Superman looked as pale as a Gothamite, and seemed to be looking for the nearest polite exit).</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhat?\u201d Marvel asked.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cPull a Batman. Adoption. I can do it,\u201d Phantom said with the absolute surety of a stubborn teenager with a barely thought through plan (he had heard that from Wally so many times, Barry almost reflexively said no. That would\u2019ve been awkward).</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Marvel turned to fully face Phantom and Barry felt his heart go down from \u2018speed of sound\u2019 to \u2018I just ran around the world fifteen times\u2019. \u201cYou don\u2019t have a legal identity. How would you manage that?\u201d Marvel seemed amused, and far less pissed than he did moments before.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI don\u2019t have an </span>\n<em>\n<span>Earth</span>\n</em>\n<span> legal identity, I could adopt him through the ghost system,\u201d Phantom turned to floating on his back in front of Captain (also being a convenient barrier between Marvel and Superman), \u201cBut that might also take a century. How about a magic adoption, oh Champion of Magic?\u201d Marvel snorted, and Barry felt some more of the tension leave his body.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNot sure that\u2019s how it works. And Phantasm will fight you for the right,\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAh, damn it. I didn\u2019t think of that. She\u2019ll pull a Batman all by herself, she doesn\u2019t need any help,\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHow about Superboy Sr.'s phone number?\u201d Red Hood asked, waving his phone over at Phantom and Captain Marvel. \u201cRed Robin said he\u2019ll give it to me, but only if I tell him what for, and I don\u2019t know how I\u2019m supposed to phrase this,\u201d Marvel fully turned away from Superman and strode over to Red Hood, with Phantom chattering idly over his shoulder.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>No more ozone. No more frost. No more static electricity making him feel like he was seconds away from the accident that gave him his powers all over again. Barry turned to Dinah. \u201cCan I move my appointment closer?\u201d The League\u2019s resident therapist looked at him, then the rest of the League as chatter began to slowly resume.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI\u2019ll try to fit you in. I have a feeling I\u2019m going to be very busy, very soon,\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>********</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Danny ran his fingers through Billy\u2019s hair, pulling gently at tangles and smoothing them out. They were reclining on the couch at home. They hadn\u2019t stayed much longer after, well, Superman. \u201cSo that was an evening,\u201d Danny said. Billy huffed and buried his face in Danny\u2019 stomach. \u201cTell me what\u2019s on your mind?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Billy sighed deeply. \u201cIs it bad I don\u2019t regret getting mad at Superman? And insulting him? You\u2019re not exactly supposed to insult your coworker. And I think I really scared Flash. I didn\u2019t mean to, but that doesn\u2019t change the fact that I did. He didn\u2019t do anything wrong,\u201d Danny smiled gently and scritched lightly at Billy\u2019s scalp.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou were defending your family. And I think Superman may have needed the fear of six gods and one Billy Batson put into him. If you apologized to Flash for scaring him, I\u2019m sure he\u2019d accept your apology. And I doubt this is the first time that one of the League members got scary. Batman is always scary, isn\u2019t he?\u201d Danny poked Billy in the side and Billy let out a giggle.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cBatman wasn\u2019t scary when he was talking about Jason,\u201d Billy laughed.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cSo you can be reverse Batman; not be scary when it comes to everything but family, while he\u2019s always scary except when it comes to family,\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Billy snorted. \u201cThat\u2019s not how it works. I bet that anyone who insults any of the Bats faces Batman\u2019s fury.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAnd why do you have to be any different? You were defending Elle, and Superboy. I\u2019m proud of you for telling him off,\u201d Danny smiled and pressed a kiss to Billy\u2019s head. Danny felt Billy\u2019s hands clench in his shirt</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI did it for them, yeah. But\u2026 I think I did it for me too,\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYeah?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI was\u2026 I was a scared kid too. And people always tell you, your family will be there for you, the police will help you, it\u2019s your teacher\u2019s job to help, they\u2019ll believe you. I was a scared kid, and I just wanted </span>\n<em>\n<span>someone-</span>\n</em>\n<span>\u201d Danny felt his core pull as Billy sniffled into his shirt, \u201cTo look at me. Really see me, and how I feel, and not </span>\n<em>\n<span>reject </span>\n</em>\n<span>me. I needed a hero. Superboy needed a hero, to look at him and to see him. And Superman rejected him. I couldn\u2019t get people to help me, when I was younger but\u2026 I can do something for Superboy, even when I can\u2019t do something for the person I was. A hero is supposed to help everyone, unconditionally. And Superman didn\u2019t. So when a hero fucks up,\u201d Billy looked up at Danny, blue eyes glinting with determination and the surety of knowledge millenia old contained in a twelve year old, \u201cIt\u2019s gotta be someone who cares that fixes it. And I do. I care,\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAnd that, I feel, is your greatest superpower,\u201d Danny said quietly, adjusting Billy into a hug. Billy latched on like a koala bear and shoved his warm face into Danny\u2019s neck. Danny heard a mumble. \u201cWhat was that?\u201d Billy turned his face.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIt\u2019s yours too,\u201d Billy whispered, and Danny could have sworn his core stopped pulsing in time with his heart. \u201cYou care. You care for </span>\n<em>\n<span>me. </span>\n</em>\n<span>You may not be on the Justice League, or fight crime, but,\u201d Blue eyes filled with lightning and knowledge beyond his time met blue eyes shadowed with green and an innate understanding of death people were never truly supposed to know, \u201cYou\u2019re my hero,\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Danny held Billy close as his core pulsed with an indescribable feeling that mostly just made him want to cry. \u201cI love you,\u201d He whispered.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI love you too,\u201d Billy replied. The two remained on the couch for a while longer, and Danny\u2019s legs went numb, but he wouldn\u2019t trade this. Not for anything in or out of existence.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>*******</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Hundreds of miles away, a young woman took out her phone to check her notifications. She looked at her text notifications as her long black hair whipped behind her. </span>\n<em>\n<span>Oh? </span>\n</em>\n<span>She thought, looking at the texts from the man she called brother and the boy she claimed as her nephew, </span>\n<em>\n<span>A hopeful new addition to the family? </span>\n</em>\n<span>Her face split into a wide grin that did not truly fit on her face. </span>\n<em>\n<span>I call dibs.</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 Billy checked the time. 6:55. He paused his game and opened a new tab. LePete was going to have to wait for his donuts for the next hour. It was time for therapy with Jazz. Pull up the email with the recurring link, put on his headphones, double check his volume, and-</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 The screen loads quickly to show that Jazz was already there, and he smiles, quickly enabling video. \u201cHi Billy,\u201d She says, smiling, \u201cHow was your week?\u201d Billy grins slantedly in return.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u201cWell, there was a bit of an incident. You remember how the League mistook Phantom for Marvel\u2019s kid? Danny convinced me to take him to a \u2018bring your kid to\u00a0 </span>\n<span>work\u2019 evening. It went\u2026 interestingly,\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u201cOh? In a good way or a bad way?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u201cUh, kinda bad. I scared a bunch of the Leaguers when I got mad at Superman. I apologized to the ones I scared, particularly Flash, and they said it was fine,\u201d He paused, and the silence stretched for a moment as Billy tried in vain to pick a word to continue his story.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u201cCorrect me if I\u2019m wrong, but I feel like I\u2019m sensing a but here?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 Billy frowned and brought his right leg up onto his chair and curled into it, propping his chin on his knee. \u201cYeah. I didn\u2019t apologize to Superman. And I don\u2019t want to! He\u2019s the one in the wrong, and it\u2019s okay for me to be mad and express it. But I just wonder, why\u2019s my first instinct to apologize? Even though I know I\u2019m in the right, I still get the impulse to. Where\u2019d that come from?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 Jazz shifted on screen, uncrossing her legs and leaning forward slightly. \u201cWhere do </span>\n<em>\n<span>you</span>\n</em>\n<span> think that came from?\u201d She asked. Billy recognized this, giving him the chance to explore his thoughts and feelings and whatever possible answers he could think of.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 Billy tilted his head from where it lay on his knee. \u201cOne reason I can think of is because, I guess I\u2019m used to it? Being expected to apologize even when I don\u2019t want to. Like giving attitude to a foster parent when they\u2019re the ones who are shouting at me and not listening to what I\u2019m saying. Or \u2018cause he\u2019s an adult and I\u2019m not supposed to talk back. That makes problems for me in the future, and I\u2019m gonna need to work with Superman later, and the rest of the League,\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u201cSo, it being reflex and being worried about it impacting you negatively later. Can you think of any other reason?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 Billy scrunched up his nose. \u201cWell, a reason I would feel like apologizing was if I was actually in the wrong. But I\u2019m not, so that\u2019s off the table. I can\u2019t really think of anything else,\u201d He shrugged, bringing up his other leg onto his chair and propping it under him as he sat up.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u201cThat\u2019s perfectly fine,\u201d Jazz replied, \u201cI think you\u2019ve brought up plenty to work with. You brought up previous foster parents?\u201d Billy nodded.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u201cYeah, I had to apologize even when I didn\u2019t mean it. Like getting into a fight with another kid because he was picking on one of the younger kids for whatever. That happened a bunch. And then we\u2019d have to apologize to each other, but they never meant it so why should I?\u201d He scowled and crossed his arms, leaning back into his chair. \u201cAnd if I pissed off my foster parents too much, made \u2018too much trouble\u2019, they would kick me to the next group that would take me. And back in my younger years, I was too scared of the streets to try to go it alone. So I sucked it up and apologized to whoever I had to to try to keep from burning any more bridges than I had to,\u201d Billy tilted his head. \u201cMaybe the reasons I gave are linked. A reflex other people drilled into me when I was trying to keep things from coming back to bite me later. Yeah, that sounds about right,\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 Jazz smiled. \u201cOkay, so you figured out where it came from and why. Do you want to do something about it?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 Billy squinted and thought over the question for a moment. \u201cYou\u2019re going to have to define \u2018it\u2019. I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re referencing,\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u201cThanks for telling me,\u201d Jazz smiled, \u201cI meant about the situation with Superman. Can I ask why you got mad at him in the first place?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u201cSuperman said and implied a bunch of shit about clones. Like how they have to be wanted to be loved. Or, well, made with the cell donor\u2019s permission. But it felt like he was saying that. And he\u2019s been neglecting Superboy, and that isn\u2019t right! I talked with Danny about it, and, well. We were thinking of introducing him to Elle. Or Elle to him. We have Superboy\u2019s number and everything, and I think we\u2019re going to go with it. He can join the black-hair-blue-eyes-messed-up-age club. He\u2019s like, four years old and still looks like when he first showed up, as a teenager. But Superman? I don\u2019t even know what I want to do about that,\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u201cYou said you didn\u2019t want to apologize. But what if he apologizes to you?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 Billy huffed. \u201cI\u2019m not the one he hurt, just the one he offended. He needs to apologize to Superboy and understand what he did wrong, and I can\u2019t make him do that. He needs to want to change for change to truly happen, no matter what I want,\u201d Jazz nodded.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u201cI think that\u2019s really mature of you,\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u201cReally?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u201cAs a therapist, I can only help people who want to be helped. That\u2019s why they go to a therapist in the first place. I think it\u2019s very mature of you to acknowledge that,\u201d Billy felt the warm glow of approval wash over him and he smiled bashfully, swinging his legs down from where they were propped on his chair.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u201cThank you,\u201d He replied, unsure of any other way to acknowledge it. Jazz smiled in return.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u201cNow, asides from Superman, is there anything else you want to talk about? Anything else happen at the event that you want to talk about?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u201cWell, it was kind of amusing to see Jason lose his mind to see Danny with Captain Marvel. Maybe I should let him in on my identity. I feel like that\u2019d make things easier,\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u201cHow so?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u201cWell, for starters\u2026\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>*****************</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 Danny looked up from where he was finishing dinner at the sound of Billy coming out of his room. \u201cHey Billy! How\u2019d therapy go?\u201d Billy dropped into his seat at the table.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u201cFine,\u201d Billy replied easily. Danny nodded and turned back to the pasta sauce he was finishing.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u201cJason\u2019s coming for dinner since he\u2019s in the area,\u201d Danny told Billy.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u201cHuh, that\u2019s a coincidence,\u201d Danny quickly clicked the stovetop off and ducked down to check on the garlic bread before turning to Billy.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u201cWhy?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u201cWell,\u201d Billy kicked his feet, not quite meeting Danny\u2019s eyes, \u201cI wanna tell him. About me being Captain Marvel,\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 Danny nodded and turned to the strainer in the sink. He picked it up and moved to pour the pasta back into the pot while he spoke. \u201cCool. Think you could do it tonight, or would you rather have more prep time and do it later?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u201cTonight, I think. I never feel ready to tell anyone, but I trust Jason. Might as well tear off the bandaid and get it over with. But could you do something for me?\u201d Danny put the now empty strainer down and turned to Billy.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u201cAnything,\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u201cFilm his reaction,\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u201cHell yeah,\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>*****************</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 Tucker turned from the tv to his phone as it buzzed, and hardly noticed Sam picking hers up too. In the \u2018in the know family group chat\u2019 chat, there was a new video message from Danny, labeled Highlights of The ReactionTM. Tucker looked over to Sam. \u201cYou seeing this?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 She nodded, \u201cOh yeah. Wanna watch it together?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u201cFuck yeah,\u201d Tucker grinned as he slid onto the arm of Sam\u2019s armchair. She pressed play, and the video took a moment to load before opening on Jason in Danny\u2019s living room, jaw hanging and eyes wide, and Billy, looking nervous but relieved. Jason pointed from Billy to the cameraman, then back to Billy, then back to cameraman, Billy, cameraman, before burying his face in his hands and screaming. The video jumped to a new point of view.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 Jason still had his face in his hands, and Billy was patting his back concilatorily while the cameraman shook with hardly contained laughter. \u201cIt\u2019s so obvious! But not- how did I not see it? How did Batman- oh my god Batman asked for parenting advice from a twelve year old, holy </span>\n<em>\n<span>fuck-\u201d </span>\n</em>\n<span>Another jump.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 Jason was now laughing uproariously on the floor, with Billy looking on very concerned from the couch. \u201cThey let a- hah- twelve- hah- they- hah!\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 Another jump. Jason was still laughing hysterically. Jump. Jason inhaled deeply as he seemed to be over his laughing fit. He inhaled deeply. Dissolved into laughter again. Jump.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u201cThey think you\u2019re what? Why??\u201d Jump.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u201cThat\u2019s fucking hilarious, I\u2019m in. What are you planning with Superboy though?\u201d Jump.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019ve got black hair, blue eyes, and a fucked up age, am I part of the club?\u201d Jason asked, lounging on the couch with a grin.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u201cYeah. Welcome to another fucked up black haired blue eyed adoptive family, little brother,\u201d The cameraman, Danny, spoke coherently for the first time. Jason\u2019s face dropped.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u201cWh- you can\u2019t adopt me! I\u2019m an adult! We\u2019re Batmanning Kon, not me!\u201d Jason protested before Billy giggled before falling into peals of laughter, tipping into Jason\u2019s side. Jason\u2019s face visibly softened as he looked down at the giggling child.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u201cUncle Jason,\u201d Danny whispered. Jason flipped the camera off. The video ended. Tucker looked at Sam. Sam looked at Tucker. With timing that could only be assisted by Clockwork, the group chat chimed again. They looked down.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<span>\u00a0 Jason Todd has been added to the chat.</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Kon stared at his phone. He took his sunglasses off, took a deep breath, and looked again. Nope, still there. Unknown number. Five second video he hadn\u2019t dared open. The ominous message of \u2018one of us\u2019. There could only be one culprit.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>He picked up on the second ring.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cTim, what the fuck?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou\u2019re gonna have to specify,\u201d the sleepy voice of his best friend came through on speaker phone as Kon sat up on the couch at Young Justice. (He was going to ignore the fact that the couch is where he slept most days. He didn\u2019t exactly have a real home to go to.)</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cUnknown number on the phone </span>\n<em>\n<span>you </span>\n</em>\n<span>coded. I know you had to have something to do with it. If the video is a rick roll, I swear-\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNot a rick roll. I gave Jason your number,\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Kon blinked. He had, of course, heard of the infamous undead-on-and-off-again-murderous-but-has-calmed-down-significantly-in-the-past-year Bat vigliante that Tim called a brother. But what the hell would he want with Kon? He hadn\u2019t done anything\u2026 he thinks. \u201c</span>\n<em>\n<span>Why?\u201d </span>\n</em>\n<span>Kon asked, exasperated.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhy what?\u201d Tim replied.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhy does he have my number? Why did he text me? Why does it say \u2018</span>\n<em>\n<span>one of us\u2019</span>\n</em>\n<span>? Pretty much any of those things, Tim,\u201d Kon could practically hear Tim blink slowly in the way that he did when he was still processing waking up.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOne of us? Yeah, I think I know why you received that. Though I\u2019m not sure he sent you that. I gave him your number to pass along, after all,\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Kon inhaled. Exhaled. \u201cPass along </span>\n<em>\n<span>to who??</span>\n</em>\n<span>\u201d He was fairly sure he was at the end of his, admittedly short, rope.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWatch the video, that might clear things up,\u201d Tim suggested.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIt\u2019s five seconds long, what the hell could it clear up?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cJust watch it, dude.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cFine!\u201d Kon clicked away angrily from the call, leaving it running as he pulled up the text and subsequent video again. He clicked it, and waited for barely a moment before the camera opened to\u2026 Captain Marvel, glaring at Superman who looked rather afraid, with a glowing teenager with no feet hovering over his shoulder. The camera was shaking like the camera person was shivering or resisting the urge to laugh. \u2018I\u2019m going to pull a Batman,\u2019 The teenager spoke loudly. And then the video ended. \u201cTim,\u201d Kon said,</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYes?\u201d Tim replied far too innocently.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThis still makes absolutely nothing clear. Who\u2019s the kid?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cPhantom, Captain Marvel\u2019s adopted ghost kid,\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHe has a- no, not the point. Was the kid threatening to\u2026 fight </span>\n<em>\n<span>me</span>\n</em>\n<span>? Superman? Ban metas from Fawcett like Batman does with Gotham? What the hell does pulling a Batman mean?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAh, okay. Yeah, out of context I can tell it\u2019d be weird. Am I gonna have to be the one to explain this? Man, fuck Jason. I thought Marvel, Phantom, Phantasm, and he had it handled,\u201d Tim replied disgruntledly.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cPhantasm who?\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cPhantasm me!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Kon shrieked and threw his phone across the room. A white gloved hand was reaching </span>\n<em>\n<span>out of his phone screen, </span>\n</em>\n<span>which was some Ring horror shit, and seemed to be </span>\n<em>\n<span>pulling themselves out of the phone screen. </span>\n</em>\n<span>Nevermind the young feminine voice that spoke before. Nevermind how small the hand that was pulling themselves was. Little ghost girls pulling themselves out of your phone was a </span>\n<em>\n<span>fucking horrific nightmare.</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cKon?\u201d Tim asked. Good, the call was still on. Someone would at least hear him before he died.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThe girl from the Ring is going to murder me. Divide my stuff between you, Cass, and Bart,\u201d Kon replied, staring in horror as a little head </span>\n<em>\n<span>squeezed </span>\n</em>\n<span>then popped through the screen.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNot her! She\u2019s actually pretty nice once you get to know her,\u201d The kid with glowing green eyes and a white ponytail flowing like water spoke easily, like that wasn\u2019t a highly disturbing sentence. In a reality bending move, the kid, Phantasm (?) pulled herself the rest of the way out of his phone. She squeezed the rest of the way out, and then floated over his phone across the room. She looked over at Kon and grinned a bright smile. \u201cHi! Thanks for opening the video, finally gave me the connection to come meet you,\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI-What?\u201d Kon asked.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOh, are you Phantasm? You sound younger than I expected,\u201d Tim added, sounding unconcerned with </span>\n<em>\n<span>Kon\u2019s impending murder.\u00a0</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYup!\u201d Phantasm picked up Kon\u2019s phone and zipped over to him, legs fusing into a wispy tail. Kon looked her over again, and compared her to the kid he saw in the video, Phantom. Black and white jumpsuit. Wispy tail, glowing green eyes, floating white hair. Extreme similarities to Captain Marvel\u2019s kid, was she another one of his? Why did she want to see him?\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>She stuck her hand out with his phone and grinned cheekily. He noted her fangs. \u201cYou dropped this,\u201d Kon took it back.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThanks, I guess. So uh, what are you doing here?\u201d Kon checked his phone. The call with Tim was still running.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI wanna ask you to join the club,\u201d She smiled, floating lazily in the air. He noted the odd way she flew, hardly moving up or down, less like she was flying by concentration but that it was her normal state of being, rather than staying on the ground.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhat club?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThe-black-hair-blue-eyed-fucked-up-age family club,\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThe what?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIt\u2019s for our member\u2019s ears only, so I\u2019m gonna have to ask you to leave mystery phone guy,\u201d </span>\n<em>\n<span>Please don\u2019t leave, please don\u2019t leave, please-</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYeah, sure,\u201dTim said before the phone in Kon\u2019s hand chimed, indicating that he hung up. Leaving him alone. With a small, floating, glowing child staring at him with big, innocent, green eyes.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cSo uh,\u201d Kon started. Stopped. \u201cDo you want to sit down?\u201d He gestured over to his couch.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cSo polite!\u201d Phantasm chirped, floating over, before sitting down, tail unfurling back into legs. \u201cSo, I get that I\u2019m the guest here, but also the one with answers,\u201d Phantasm pointed finger guns at Kon, \u201cFire away,\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Kon inhaled. Exhaled. Sat down on the couch as well, and decided to start from the top. \u201cAlright, so, what did the \u2018one of us\u2019 text mean?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Phantasm grinned, \u201cWell, besides the aforementioned club, I meant,\u201d And here she grew slightly nervous, twirling the end of her ponytail around her hand, \u201cAs a fellow clone,\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Kon blinked. \u201cI-oh. You\u2019re\u2026 like me?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Phantasm smiled, \u201cYeah. A lot like you. I want to start this off with full honesty, so,\u201d White rings swept over Phantasm, starting at her middle and spreading out. The young girls eyes he had been staring at were now a hoodie-clad chest. He looked up into a young woman\u2019s blue eyes which sparked with a sort of nervousness he almost recognized. \u201cI\u2019m a half ghost,\u201d The girl, now woman, said, spinning her black ponytail between her fingers, \u201cWhen I was created, I was at about the development of a twelve year old. It\u2019s been thirteen years, and I have the physicality and mentality of a twenty five year old,\u201d Her nervous smiled slanted, \u201cMy brother slash genetic donor jokes that I still act like a twelve year old. And then I easily beat him with my spice tolerance and he stops talking about it,\u201d She joked.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Kon just stared. Clone. Twelve. Thirteen. Twenty five. Turned from white hair green eye child into black haired blue eyed woman. Tried to joke with him, and share parts of herself, and looked at him with nervous eyes. Waiting. Assessing him (like the doctors used to. Like Superman did. Like the Justice League did, </span>\n<em>\n<span>what powers did he have, how did he act, how was he </span>\n</em>\n<b>\n<em>different</em>\n</b>\n<span>). But then he blinked. Looked in her blue eyes. Wait, she wasn\u2019t assessing him. She was waiting for </span>\n<em>\n<span>his </span>\n</em>\n<span>assessment. Looking for some kind of recognition, the hope of acceptance, reaching out for kinship, hoping he would take the hand she stretched out. Was this how he had looked at Superman? Looking for recognition of his actions, hoping for acceptance </span>\n<strike>\n<span>for family</span>\n</strike>\n<span>, reaching out a hand to be lifted up out of the isolation he had been born into?</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>But\u2026 he wasn\u2019t the one reaching out a hand. It was another clone. Who seemed to have a good relationship with her original. Who looked at him, like he was\u2026 a gift. </span>\n<strike>\n<span>He\u2019d seen Superman look at Jon that way.</span>\n</strike>\n<span> Kon didn\u2019t know what was going on, anymore than he did at the beginning of his call to Tim. But\u2026 he wanted this. It wasn\u2019t selfish to want to know more, right? To want to take the hand offered to him. So Kon\u2026 reached back.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI\u2019m Kon,\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Her eyes sparked with unbridled joy, and she grinned widely. \u201cI\u2019m Elle,\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>And she took his hand.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWait, wait, let me see if I\u2019ve got this straight. You. Are the clone of a vigilante-\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cRetired vigilante,\u201d Elle cut in. Kon ignored her.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cMade by his nemesis to replace him, said nemesis being a billionaire with an unhealthy infatuation with him. You, however, rebelled against your conditioning and broke free with the help of a couple teenage vigilantes. Do I have that right?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0Elle leaned back onto the arm of the couch. \u201cYup,\u201d she said, popping the \u2018p\u2019.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cDude,\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cDude?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cThat\u2019s basically my origin story. Did Luthor like, rip off Vlad? Did they work together on it or something, because that is so creepily close to me?\u201d Kon leaned towards her.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0Elle smiled. This was going far better than she thought it would, especially with the, well, interesting introduction she chose. She just didn\u2019t know how else to do it! She wanted to meet him as soon as possible, and to explain, and to learn all about him, </span>\n<strike>\n<span>and adopt him</span>\n</strike>\n<span>, and to make a good impression. When she\u2019d first heard from Danny that there was a clone like her that he wanted her to meet, she had been intrigued. Then Billy had added his two cents on how Superman had </span>\n<em>\n<span>neglected </span>\n</em>\n<span>Kon, and well\u2026 New friend became new family member, and then she met him and became new son. He just\u2026 he was just-</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYou\u2019re really cool,\u201d Kon said, snapping Elle out of her head.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWhat?\u201d She asked, utterly bewildered. Where had this come from?</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0Kon fidgeted, rocking back and forth on his hands. \u201cIt\u2019s, well\u2026\u201d Kon trailed off and looked away. \u201cYou, you know what you want. What you\u2019re doing. How you want to live your life. Your travels sound amazing! You go where you want when you want and you\u2026 you make me feel like\u2026\u201d Elle held out her hand towards Kon. He took it and squeezed. He looked up at her. \u201cI\u2019ve barely met you and you already make me feel like I could be someone. That maybe,\u201d He swept the hand that wasn\u2019t in Elle\u2019s under his sunglasses, \u201cMaybe I could be me and that isn\u2019t a bad thing,\u201d His voice broke, and so did the few shards remaining of Elle\u2019s self restraint.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cCan I hug you?\u201d She asked quietly. Kon nodded, and tore his sunglasses off before burying his face in Elle\u2019s shoulder as she wrapped her arms around him. \u201cIt\u2019s okay to not know who you are,\u201d She whispered to the teenager in her arms as she rocked him side to side </span>\n<strike>\n<span>like the child she never got to be</span>\n</strike>\n<span>, \u201cShow me a teenager who says they know exactly who they are, and I\u2019ll show you a liar. Being a clone adds a hell of a lot more complications, but this is our life, and despite what others may have said, there\u2019s nothing wrong with that. You </span>\n<em>\n<span>are</span>\n</em>\n<span> someone. You can be Kon, or Superboy, or the next Superman, or a school teacher, a librarian, a politician, hell you could be, like, a priest if you wanted to,\u201d Kon huffed a wet laugh into Elle\u2019s shoulder, and she took it as a win, \u201cBecause you are a </span>\n<em>\n<span>person. </span>\n</em>\n<span>A unique, amazing person, who is so kind and deserves the world, and I would give it to you if you let me,\u201d Kon lifted his head up to look her in the eyes, though he remained halfway curled into her lap.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWhadda you mean?\u201d He sniffed, and Elle\u2019s heart ached as he looked so hopeful, looking at her like </span>\n<em>\n<span>she </span>\n</em>\n<span>was a hero with a plan and answers to save him. So she put on the smile she had seen Danny use during his vigilante days, the one she thought looked like a hug and the words that everything would be alright.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI travel a lot, and I would stop and settle down around you if you asked, but I also want to know if you\u2019d like to travel with me,\u201d Kon looked at her, blue eyes wide, and Elle had to resist the urge to bundle him in blankets and protect him from everything that ever hurt him, \u201cI traveled to find myself, to get away from what people said I had to be. I never got into the whole vigilante thing like Danny, though I got some good urban and cryptid legends. I just got out there, and lived the life I hadn\u2019t gotten to experience. There was always somewhere new, something new to experience, and not a single person knew me. Not a single person to expect something of me or tell me what to be. Traveling was amazing for me, and I\u2019d love it if you traveled with me. I can show you the best food stand in Hong Kong, and that the most amazing sunsets are at Rarotonga, or absolutely anywhere you want to go!\u201d Elle was getting excited. It\u2019d been years since Danny had traveled with her, and as much as she enjoyed the independence, it still got lonely.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cAnd, you wanna know something?\u201d Elle smiled.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0Kon looked up at her. \u201cYeah?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI think </span>\n<em>\n<span>you\u2019re </span>\n</em>\n<span>the really cool one. You\u2019ve been so strong, to do this all on your own. To find the strength to try to help other people. Even if you did it initially to prove a point to someone, you kept going. You saved </span>\n<em>\n<span>lives, </span>\n</em>\n<span>you\u2019re so young and you\u2019ve done so much for other people. But you can let go now. You can do things for yourself. It isn\u2019t selfish to want to live your life,\u201d Kon shoved his face into Elle\u2019s shoulder, making vague sniffling noises. There was definitely snot on her hoodie, but she\u2019d had worse things on it, so whatever.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s okay to be selfish,\u201d She said again, rocking Kon back and forth as his tears increased. Elle pursed her lips as her eyes teared in turn. \u201cIt\u2019s okay to be selfish, it really is, I know it\u2019s hard to accept, but it\u2019s okay, you\u2019re okay,\u201d Whoops, she was sobbing too now. She should\u2019ve expected this, she had seen Danny and Billy and their upbringing-related trauma emotional-breakdowns, so it was her turn, apparently, to have one.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYou can be you, and that\u2019s okay. It\u2019s okay, it\u2019s okay,\u201d She didn\u2019t know how long she rocked back and forth, crying quietly with Kon in her arms. When her sniffles finally ran out, and Kon moved his head from her shoulder and blinked wearily, she smiled softly. \u201cSo,\u201d she asked, sounding more congested than Billy and his pollen allergies at the DC cherry blossom festival, \u201cWhat\u2019s a woman gotta do to get a drink around here? My head hurts,\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0Kon sniffled and laughed. \u201cMe too,\u201d He rubbed his eyes. \u201cKitchen\u2019s to the\u2026\u201d He trailed off and waved vaguely to the left, \u201cThat way,\u201d Elle stood up, and started to turn away when Kon grabbed her wrist. \u201cWait!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0Elle turned to him and smiled softly, \u201cYeah?\u201d Kon chewed his lip before standing up beside her.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cTake me with you?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0Elle grinned, and shifted her grip to hold Kon\u2019s hand. \u201cAlways,\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>**************</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0Danny closed the hood of his client's car and wiped his forearm across his forehead. It was probably smudging any oil or dirt on his face even further, but whatever. His phone buzzed in the pocket of his overalls, and he quickly crossed over to one of the conveniently placed sinks.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0Danny dried his hands off, and pulled his phone out. It was a text from Elle. He opened it, and then smiled. Elle had her arm looped over the shoulder of a teenage boy wearing a leather jacket with studs on the shoulders and a hesitant smile. Elle was grinning brightly and had one hand thrown up in a peace sign. </span>\n<em>\n<span>Travel companion acquired! </span>\n</em>\n<span>the subsequent text read. Danny grinned. Billy would be so happy to hear this.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0There was nothing like flying, in Billy\u2019s opinion. Absolutely nothing. People had asked him before what flying felt like to him. Civilians, his aunts and uncles, even some of the Justice League had asked him before. And the truth was, he couldn\u2019t explain it.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0Was it like a prehensile tail? An entirely different set of muscles that other people didn\u2019t have and let him do things that others couldn\u2019t? While the comparison of different muscles made a certain amount of sense, it just didn\u2019t encompass the full feeling. It wasn\u2019t just a limb attached to you, it was something </span>\n<em>\n<span>more.</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0And it wasn\u2019t like it was for Danny, when gravity was hardly more than a suggestion. Danny could transfer his flight to others when in contact, so Billy knew what it felt like, and it certainly wasn\u2019t what it felt like as Captain Marvel. Everything was just\u2026 zero gravity. Absolutely nothing affected the way you wanted to go except for wanting to go that way. It was entirely, completely effortless. That wasn\u2019t what flying was like for him.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0If he had to pick something, how flying </span>\n<em>\n<span>really </span>\n</em>\n<span>felt like for him, it would be how professional figure skating looked. It was a glide through the air, seemingly so easy but entirely deceptive of the effort that went into it. It was full body, he used every muscle he had to maintain control.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0The impeccable balance of figure skaters as they twirled and glided, leapt through the air only to crash back down onto an unforgiving surface and never lose their stride. Young children had to learn how to walk, to develop a sense of balance before going to anything more complicated like dancing or any of that. Flight was teaching yourself how to balance all over again. What force do you exert to stay upright? Where? Did balancing on one foot make it easier, like he\u2019d seen some other heroes do, flying upright with one leg tucked like an absurdly coloured flamingo?</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0It was both as freeing as it was intensive, muscle memory to focus, intentions to purpose. It looked like defying gravity to some people, but it most certainly wasn\u2019t. You had to work with gravity to catch people falling off buildings, to slow the inertia of a train without killing everyone inside with what was basically a stoppable force against an immovable object. One of those would win. One of those could be irreparably broken.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0Superpowers weren\u2019t easy. The learning curve of broken cement when he landed with too much force, learning how to ease into turns and pivots of flying rather than catapulting himself into a billboard, or an opponent, or an opposing billboard (it\u2019s happened). How much electricity would knock someone out? How much would </span>\n<em>\n<span>kill </span>\n</em>\n<span>them?\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0It was terrifying. It was wonderful. It was exhilarating. It was </span>\n<em>\n<span>awful. </span>\n</em>\n<span>The fear, so much fear, when he had realised what he was capable of. </span>\n<em>\n<span>He was so, so lucky</span>\n</em>\n<span>, Billy thought looking over to Danny where he was swatting his hand playfully through a cloud, </span>\n<em>\n<span>that he had someone to guide him</span>\n</em>\n<span>. Someone who had went through it before he did, who could teach him, </span>\n<em>\n<span>help him, </span>\n</em>\n<span>if only he reached out to take it. And he did.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cLast one to the exosphere is a rotten egg!\u201d Billy called before shooting up. He laughed when he heard Danny\u2019s indignant squawk behind him. Billy relished the wind throwing his hair around his face, how the blue sky tried to swallow him whole. It was utterly beautiful, how the clouds he punched through left a brief dew on his skin before being whipped away by the wind. Anyone below might see the sudden change in the shape of the cloud and a red blur, but that was it. There was so much anonymity to be found in the stratosphere.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0And also Danny whipping past him, form vaguely translucent in the way that meant he was intangible. Danny was taking advantage of being intangible for no air resistance? Well two could play at that game. Marvel cast a quick speed charm that he had picked up from Mercury and rocketed ahead. Billy saw Danny make a face, and then stuck his tongue out before pulling up beside him.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0The wind would have torn his breath away, if he had needed to breathe, and it howled in his ears like a triumphant shout. It was over all too soon, and the speed of a god overcame the advantage of intangibility.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0He pivoted to a stop, a chill he barely felt enveloping him in the thin atmosphere. \u201cI win!\u201d Billy called.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0Danny came to an abrupt halt beside him, pouting ridiculously. \u201cOh come on, you used magic. That\u2019s cheating,\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYou used intangibility. Turnabout is fair play,\u201d Billy crossed his arms with a smirk.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cGasp! So rude. Betrayed, by my very own son! I shall ne\u2019er recover. Tragedy of the highest degree, how shall I ever- uh. Billy? Are you okay?\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0And Billy\u2026 Billy just blinked his watering eyes (he hadn\u2019t even known he could cry as Marvel) and stuttered, \u201cIt, um\u2026 That\u2019s the-the first time you\u2019ve called me, uh\u2026 your son,\u201d Billy wrung his hands and looked down. He didn\u2019t know what was going to happen next. His mind spun out into worst case scenarios. Danny would take it back. That he didn\u2019t feel the same way towards Billy, but that was </span>\n<em>\n<span>stupid </span>\n</em>\n<span>because they had already claimed each other as family, but it felt different to be family than\u2026 dad and son.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0A white gloved hand reached over to him and took his, stopping their nervous motions. He looked up to Danny\u2019s nervous, glowing face, a hesitant smile adorning his features. \u201cYeah. You are my son. Not like, or I view you as. To me, you are my son. And it\u2019s okay if you\u2019re not ready to\u2026 or don\u2019t want to reciprocate that. I love you Billy, very, very much,\u201d Billy felt the tears that obscured his vision overflow, and he leaned forward to bury his face in Danny\u2019s thin shoulder.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201c</span>\n<em>\n<span>Dad</span>\n</em>\n<span>,\u201d He choked out. He felt small arms come up to encircle him, holding him close, softly, </span>\n<em>\n<span>tenderly </span>\n</em>\n<span>(and somewhere deep in his subconscious, in the part that was Marvel in more than just body, past champions felt warmth, even though they were long dead. Captain Marvel did not get held softly. Champions did not receive tender hugs from their parents. Magical avatars of the gods did not get happy endings. But this time? Maybe they would). \u201c</span>\n<em>\n<span>Dad,</span>\n</em>\n<span>\u201d Billy said again, and it felt just as right as the first time he said it.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cMy son,\u201d Danny murmured back, \u201cMy son,\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0High above the clouds, where there was no one else than themselves and the stars reaching above, Billy let himself smile and cry.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0He was home.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0Black and white. White and black. So similar, yet so different. Opposing worldviews but without the other the world couldn\u2019t exist as it did. Yin and yang, an eternal balance that spun around and around until the heat death of the universe. Wasn\u2019t that its own balance? A big bang and then billions of years later a big crush as it all collapses.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0But which to choose. Black on black. Black and white. White and black. Could there even be a choice? Or was it just choosing the colours of today before plunging back into the unknown murky waters of every other day of his life?</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0Jason shook his head. As much fun as it was to monologue safely within the confines of his own mind, he was still on a deadline. Now, white shirt or black shirt? With the black pants and jacket already, the white might be a good break to the same colours. It would match well with his red tie and his helmet too, but then again he could say the same for black. White and black were base colours that could go with any accent. Now in terms of practicality in the face of bloodshed? Both of those had their pros and cons.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0Okay, </span>\n<em>\n<span>maybe </span>\n</em>\n<span>Jason didn\u2019t have to labour over his clothing choices so much. He was the goddamn Red Hood, people judged him at the peril of their own kneecaps. But it was also about </span>\n<em>\n<span>sending a message. </span>\n</em>\n<span>He couldn\u2019t appear anything less than professional at his own semiannual board of goonion review, as he liked to call it.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0Jason didn\u2019t exactly </span>\n<em>\n<span>give up </span>\n</em>\n<span>his crime lord status once the green of the Lazarus Pit had receded. No fucking way, he spent too much time and effort on it. Was there a sharp decline in the number of heads in duffle bags to zero? Yes, absolutely. But was there good he could do with his status? Also yes. Staying on top was a good way to protect people. Having his own agenda and group meant he could curb the effects of criminals that he might not have reached before.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0There were good people who did bad things because there was nowhere else to go. He could provide a place to go, a job to have that wasn\u2019t too far out of their comfort zone, and be a place where people could find their feet in an uncaring city.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0Ergo, crime lord. It was also very efficient for making a living. No living legal identity (for now\u2026?) made it hard to get a job. So he made his own job. Being a crime lord was difficult, yes, but it was plenty fulfilling in its own way.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0Now, black shirt had its pros, it was less likely to show blood in case of a fight, but he couldn\u2019t exactly bleach it. White, of course, he could dunk in a vat of bleach or vinegar (not both at the same time, if he was going to make chlorine gas it would be </span>\n<em>\n<span>on purpose </span>\n</em>\n<span>thank you very much) with reckless abandon. The blood would be very evident in the moment, however\u2026 Which had its own bonuses in the name of intimidation. Why did this have to be so complicated! He could roll up in full Hood outfit and none of his beloved minions would judge him! But he would judge himself. So\u2026</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0Black on black, black and white, white and black\u2026\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0Jason was about a minute away from giving up and choosing via eeny-meeny-miny-mo when a brilliant green portal tore open in his living room. Given Danny\u2019s predisposition for popping in, Jason wasn\u2019t worried. He\u2019d have to tell Danny to buzz off though, there was only a short period of time considered \u2018fashionably late\u2019 to your own function. (Ugh, so Bruce </span>\n<em>\n<span>did</span>\n</em>\n<span> teach him something besides vigilantism. Gross.)</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0Danny stuck his head through in Phantom form, eyes blazing a ferocious green, and rarely seen crown spinning agitatedly over his head. \u201cYou. I need you to keep an eye on Billy,\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0Jason blinked. Danny seemed very ruffled. \u201cI kind of have my own thing going on soon. Does he really need a baby-sitter?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cFor my own peace of mind and so I don\u2019t bite someone\u2019s head off, </span>\n<em>\n<span>yes. </span>\n</em>\n<span>There\u2019s a trial, and Tucker\u2019s there as the reincarnation of Duulaman, and Sam\u2019s in the zone dealing with Overgrowth\u2019s garden with Jazz and Elle\u2019s in the Mariana trench with Kon so I can\u2019t get in touch with her and-\u201d Danny paused, took a deep (and while in Phantom form, entirely unnecessary) breath, \u201cPlease. For my own peace of mind. I know it\u2019s your board of review today, but I couldn\u2019t think of anywhere safer with people I trust,\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0Jason sniffed, because there was dust in his eye, he was </span>\n<em>\n<span>not </span>\n</em>\n<span>touched by this show of trust by someone he considered a big brother, no absolutely not. \u201cYeah. Yeah, I got him. If any of the guys try to mess with him, they shouldn\u2019t have been part of my gang anyways,\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0Danny smiled, seeming entirely tired and relieved. \u201cThank you so much, now gottagobyeIloveyouseeyoulaterbegoodbye!\u201d Billy came popping out of the portal and Danny vanished as quickly as he had spoken his farewell. The portal in Jason\u2019s living room closed like it was never there, sans one vaguely ruffled twelve year old.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0Billy didn\u2019t get coddled often, nor babysat as far as Jason knew. The kid was far too independent and Danny too respectful of Billy\u2019s autonomy to try to infringe on that. That Danny asked for supervision in the first place, and that Billy </span>\n<em>\n<span>went along with it? </span>\n</em>\n<span>Yeah, some shit was up. But that wasn\u2019t Jason\u2019s concern, no Jason only had one pressing thing at the moment.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cSo, kid. Black shirt or white shirt?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>*****************</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0Sean liked to think he was your average Gothamite. By which he meant his entire life was, to any outsider, so goddamn weird. Started out fine. Went to school, got shoved into lockers, practiced active shooter drills with all the other kindergarteners, pick pocketed his siblings for fun, you know. The usual. He even went to college! Didn\u2019t graduate, of course, what </span>\n<em>\n<span>crazy</span>\n</em>\n<span> gothamite would actually be able to graduate college? (Given how many rouges had PHDs, Sean was probably correct on that.)</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0And then life. Got. Weirder. Bat cryptid? Fine, mothman reboot, whatever. Bat cryptid purportedly has a small child dressed like a traffic light? Umm\u2026 Bat cryptid is </span>\n<em>\n<span>real?? </span>\n</em>\n<span>And fist fighting a famous lawyer. A doctor of chemistry, medicine, and psychology too. Ecoterrorism but now with extra biological warfare. And then there were </span>\n<em>\n<span>more </span>\n</em>\n<span>crawling out of the woodwork, vigilante and rogue alike, like all they needed was one to start the avalanche.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0Sean did what any good Gothamite should do and rolled with the punches. With the emergence of new criminal elements, a new job pool opened. And, well, insulin doesn\u2019t pay for itself. Sean loved his family. He loved his siblings. He would do anything for them.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0Anything.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0Sean did a lot of things he wasn\u2019t proud of, but he tried to work for bosses he agreed with, or at least didn\u2019t hate. Cobblepot worked for a while, but the Bats busted in too often, and Sean couldn\u2019t afford to get arrested. Poison Ivy worked for a while, but the problem with being an ecoterrorist engaging in biological warfare was you got exposed to all the nasty stuff, and well, Sean couldn\u2019t afford to get sick either.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0And then there was a new boss hanging around, right in Crime Alley. He would\u2019ve taken a job with Red Hood only for the shortened commute. But the Hood said don\u2019t fuck with kids. The Hood said don\u2019t mess with the girls and guys working the street corners. And the Red Hood delivered. The Red Hood was working up to build a criminal empire, and every empire needs someone to work the spreadsheets.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0Sean didn\u2019t finish getting a degree as a business analyst, but by god he was going to use the skills he had learned. And it was fine! Great even. The boss was understanding, paid days off to take care of the family, and didn\u2019t act like he knew better than Sean at the job he was hired for.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0Sean ignored the emotional instability and mild amounts of murder. Couldn\u2019t swing a rat by the tail without hitting a killer in Gotham, and any crime boss in Gotham couldn\u2019t claim to be emotionally or mentally stable. Hood killed rapists, pedophiles, and sick fucks that no one worthwhile would be sad to see go. Sean was fairly content, making spreadsheets for weapon deals and keeping inventory of their bases and what they had in them.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0And then the Red Hood had to go ruin it all by taking off the goddamn hood. Because he was a fucking kid. Built like a tank? Yes. Extremely competent with weapons and a dead shot with a gun? Absolutely. Scruffy on the chin with nicks that showed inexperience with a razor? Yes. Sean was older than his boss by a mile.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0He knew, oh Sean </span>\n<em>\n<span>knew </span>\n</em>\n<span>what this city did to kids. Everyone grew up too quick, everyone carried a pocket knife and had sharp eyes, and kids weren\u2019t exempt. But fuck, Sean could see his little brother in the scruffy black hair that spoke of needing an actual haircut. He could see his Angel and their stubborn teenage pride in the set of Hood\u2019s jaw and the way he scowled like the world personally offended him.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0Sean tried to not change his behavior in regards to his boss, but well\u2026 After the second time he reflexively chided Hood on his language in a meeting, he had to come clean. Hood was understanding if not a tiny offended in the way that all over independent teenagers were. So Sean apparently couldn\u2019t stop his big brother instincts. Fine then. He\u2019d channel them in different ways.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0Sean packed an extra lunch every day, because his boss was a teenage tank and obviously needed a high caloric intake. Sean carried a bottle of over the counter advil, because he wouldn\u2019t doubt a crime boss/vigilante having chronic pain from injuries of some kind. And Hood obviously knew what Sean was doing, the moments of blank staring from a deadpan helmet made it clear. But Hood put up with it, and Sean continued to pack an extra lunch, and Sean had a good, stable job that he could on some level be proud of. Proud of his boss and the work he did, and the good that came of it for Crime Alley.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0Sean had to remind himself of all these things so he didn\u2019t lose his mind the instant Hood came through the door for the meeting, a small </span>\n<em>\n<span>child </span>\n</em>\n<span>in identical suit and tie </span>\n<span>trailing behind him.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cUh, whatcha got there boss?\u201d Pedro, one of the heads of \u2018acquisitions\u2019 asked. Hood held up his hand, showing off the May\u2019s Coffee Shop cup he held.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cA latte,\u201d Hood replied, striding to the head of the table, grabbing a spare chair along the way. The kid trailed behind Hood, face covered by a comically oversized Red Hood helmet, holding a smaller to-go cup in their hand. Hood sat down, and pulled the chair he grabbed to his side, the kid hopping up to sit right beside the Red Hood, crime lord extraordinaire. The kid pulled off the helmet, showing a young face with black hair and blue eyes. He sipped whatever he had in the cup and made direct eye contact with Sean. Was it too late to ask for a raise?</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cBoss, if you say this is your sidekick I will be morally required to kick you in the balls,\u201d McKenzie said bluntly, staring at the small child with what looked like a hot chocolate mustache from their to-go cup.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cIf I got a child sidekick, I'd ask you to kick me in the balls. Nah, I\u2019m just watching him as a favour. Now, let\u2019s get to it. Just because I\u2019m babysitting doesn\u2019t mean we don\u2019t have shit to get to. Let\u2019s start with Sam, what do you got for me?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0And just like that, Sean fell back into the flow of a meeting, forgetting the kid for a time as he listened to Sam and what he got from the suggestion box (hey, if it works it works), McKenzie\u2019s budgeting for the semester (rather good, they might be able to up the amount of hours their soup kitchen was open), and eventually what Sean had to say on the overall organization side of things.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cSince you made whatever truce you have with Bats we\u2019ve lost less safe houses. Not to say the Bats don\u2019t know about them, I\u2019m not stupid, but they\u2019re no longer considered a compromisation to the organization,\"</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0Hood nodded, \"Yeah, they definitely have all the places bugged,\" He sighed, almost fondly.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0\"Batman knows a lot of things,\" the kid spoke up, \"But he sure don't know everything,\"</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0\"Yup. It's Red Robin you got to watch out for,\u201d Pedro replied, \u201cHe\u2019s a scary little fu-uuudger,\u201d Pedro cringed at his lame attempt to censor himself. Sean snorted and studiously avoided the glare Pedro aimed at him. The meeting continued without any more derailments, except for when Hood handed the kid a Lunchable when they all had their lunch break.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cAnd with that, I think we\u2019re good. Any last comments?\u201d Hood asked, hours after their lunch break. Sean hoped no one else would say shit, he was so fucking tired. Whether you were talking about quarterly revenue for a legitimate business or a crime syndicate, it was all equally boring after the first five hours. \u201cAlright then. You have your tasks, we have a plan. Go forth my minions out into the world! Away with you, for familiarity breeds contempt!\u201d Sean shook his head at his boss\u2019s antics as the room quickly vacated with amused laughter. Sean stood up and cracked his back. He was in his late twenties but he was already too old for this. He sighed and grabbed his bag, giving a quick check of the rest of the room in case someone forgot something. Table looked clean. The only people left in the room were Hood, the kid, himself, and, for some reason, Camilla from PR. \u201cCamilla? Is there an issue?\u201d Hood asked.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cNo, it\u2019s just-. Kid, you wouldn\u2019t happen to be Billy, would you? From Fawcett?\u201d She asked and the Red Hood straightened up from his relaxed slouch.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWhat\u2019s it to you?\u201d he asked, voice edging on a hostile growl.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYeah, it\u2019s me. Hi Ms. Suniti, you seem like you\u2019re doing a lot better!\u201d The now named Billy cut in, smiling happily. It made sense the kid was from Fawcett, that kind of cheer was not native to Gotham.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYeah, I am, kid. You seem like you\u2019re doing better too,\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI got a dad. You\u2019re clean?\u201d The kid asked casually.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cThree and a half years. You got me my start kiddo, I can\u2019t thank you enough,\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cNuh uh,\u201d Billy denied, \u201cYou\u2019re the one who stuck with it. You just needed someone to believe you could do it,\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cBilly, I was new on the streets. You guided me through it, told me the good shelters to stay at, which ones to avoid, which jobs would give someone like me a chance. Kid, I </span>\n<em>\n<span>know </span>\n</em>\n<span>if it weren\u2019t for you I would\u2019ve ODed long ago,\u201d Camilla\u2019s eyes were shining as she crouched down in front of the kid, whose eyes looked similarly wet, \u201cCaptain Marvel wasn\u2019t around back then. The only hero I had was you, kid. So thank you. For saving my life,\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0Billy sniffled and Sean did his best to pretend that it was absolutely his dust allergies acting up, he wasn\u2019t tearing up. \u201cThank you for letting me. Can I give you a hug?\u201d Camilla nodded and spread her arms, and Billy settled into them, wrapping his arms around her. Sean looked to his boss, who seemed to be currently taking a picture and nodded at him. Hood nodded back and Sean walked out the door.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0He had a family to get back to. And hug. And maybe cry a little.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0Man, Cahal was going to tease him so much. \u2018Nothing interesting ever happens in meetings\u2019 his ass.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>**************</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0Danny looked down at his phone and the texts Jason had sent him. There was a picture of Billy hugging an Indian woman with tears slipping down her face. The text read,\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<span>Your kid rescues people in and out of costume, get a hold of him before Bruce tries for co-adoption.</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0Danny snorted and texted back.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"rtl\">\n<em>\n<span>That\u2019s my hero. And I\u2019d like to see him try</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0Danny smiled and tucked his phone into one of the pockets of his hazmat suit. A bell rang through the halls, low and haunting. Phantom let the smile fall from his face and squared his shoulders. He had the trial of one Leshy of the Okhotsk-Manchurian Taiga to get to. This would not be pleasant. Phantom straightened the Crown of Fire floating over his head, and headed back into the flames of the politics of the Infinite Realms.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0If there was one thing Captain Marvel hated about fighting in an urban environment, it was the collateral. Forget about the sheer amounts of property damage from getting flung around into buildings, parks, and pavement. It was the </span>\n<em>\n<span>people </span>\n</em>\n<span>that worried Billy. It was the people in their homes, and the kids in the parks, and the families walking along the street when they\u2019re supposed to be safe. It was even worse when there were multiple enemies, and even </span>\n<em>\n<span>even </span>\n</em>\n<span>worse when they weren\u2019t all focused on Captain Marvel.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0If it was just minions being sicced on Captain Marvel, it would be fine. Well, fine-ish. Invulnerability was good for a lot of things, but couldn\u2019t cover everything. Billy could take a hit, though. The average person on the street? When the bad guys were specifically looking to cause mass harm, to lunge at people and snap and hurt-</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0Billy couldn\u2019t handle this. He was getting overwhelmed. He was fending off what looked like the fucking </span>\n<em>\n<span>timberwolves </span>\n</em>\n<span>from My Little Pony, desperately trying to keep them away from people. But there were </span>\n<em>\n<span>so many. </span>\n</em>\n<span>And it didn\u2019t help that their particular brand of magic was effective against Billy. He was taking more solid hits than he liked.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0The interesting thing about Captain Marvel being a construct of magic and embodiment of living lightning was the fact that he didn\u2019t work like mortals. There was no blood, Captain Marvel didn\u2019t have a heart to pump it. He didn\u2019t bruise, there was nothing underneath the veneer of impenetrable skin. So when Marvel </span>\n<em>\n<span>did </span>\n</em>\n<span>get hurt, it looked\u2026 different. The gashes in his arms from claws and teeth didn\u2019t bleed, they sparked. Yellow-white lightning that flicked up and out of his arms, leaving a permanent glow lurking at the edge of his wounds. The bruises on his face from his initial encounter with the Leshen behind it all glowed an aching yellow.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0But Billy couldn\u2019t let that slow him down. He refused. This stupid forest spirit was attacking </span>\n<em>\n<span>his </span>\n</em>\n<span>city, full of </span>\n<em>\n<span>his </span>\n</em>\n<span>people. But it was so hard to protect them, as the Leshen had disappeared soon after arriving, spawning a horde of wooden wolves that attacked pretty much anything that moved. These pack animals just kept </span>\n<em>\n<span>coming </span>\n</em>\n<span>and Billy couldn\u2019t search out the Leshen while they still attacked people. And the searching, grasping vines that erupted from the streets, grabbing and crushing anything it touched, it was all too much.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0It-he couldn\u2019t- Billy was- he couldn\u2019t do this. Not alone. Captain Marvel straightened up, blowing out an exhausted but unnecessary breath. He tapped on his comm as he took to the sky, on the lookout for the next source of trouble. Maybe if he was lucky he\u2019d see where the Leshen was hiding.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cCaptain Marvel, requesting back up for civilian evacuation and threat control,\u201d Marvel said, not even bothering with pleasantries.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cUnderstood,\u201d Came the calm voice of Martian Manhunter. He must be the one on monitor duty today. \u201cAre you requesting anyone specific?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0Captain Marvel eyed the empty streets and the vines slowly encroaching across them. The wolves attacked at random intervals, sometimes in overlapping periods, and showed up anywhere across downtown Fawcett. He needed someone who could move quickly. \u201cAny of the Flashes would work. Medium number of targets across a large area, while I focus on the main threat,\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cUnderstood, Flash in en route,\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0Billy smiled at the calm demeanor of his coworker. Billy appreciated it, especially when he was getting so frazzled. It seemed, for the moment, he was getting a reprieve. Which gave him enough time to think.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0Leshen. Forest spirit. Summoning or creating wooden wolves that attacked indiscriminately. Vines that spread and contorted and strangled, springing up from the pavement like evil dandelions that ignored there was nothing from them to grow from. If they spread out above ground, he\u2019d be able to trace them to their source, but there was nothing, so there went that lead.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0Okay, weaknesses. Fire, obviously, it was a nature spirit made of wood, um, blunt force seemed to work on its minions at least. But what could Billy do? Where did it even come from?</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0\u2026Didn\u2019t Danny say something about a nature spirit that escaped from custody during its trial last week? Could this be it? Billy fired off a quick text to Danny, before shoving the phone back into his pocket dimension.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0Flash had arrived.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0Captain Marvel touched down.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWassup, Cap? What\u2019s the sitch?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0Billy quickly gave Flash all the information he had, sans the potential of this involving Danny. And just in time too. Marvel\u2019s head whipped around as a stirring of magic threaded across the street. \u201cSomething\u2019s coming. Two blocks west, I\u2019ll try to track the Leshen while you keep the wolves distracted!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0Flash saluted quickly before disappearing in a blur of red. Billy inhaled, and tried to settle. Focus on his magic, the ebb and flow. How it flowed through his body. The heated static that crackled idly throughout his being. And then how it flowed outwards. How it moved through his skin, trying to draw the torn edges back together, healing abrasions slowly to the beat of his magic.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0His magic flowed into his aura, and radiated outwards. Follow the waves, as it extended out into the world, how it caught on the edges of foreign magic invading the space where the Rock of Eternity held sway. Follow the jagged edges, how its \u2018scent\u2019 of rotting fruit and decaying flesh got stronger as he followed it.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0Flash\u2019s crackling energy and his Blessing from Mercury brushed up against Billy\u2019s senses, and was dismissed just as easily. He had to follow the sickeningly rotten energy, towards what was supposed to be a being of life. A particularly strong tear, and a tug on the fabric of Fawcett\u2019s native magic, and-</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0Captain Marvel opened his eyes and took off to Fawcett City\u2019s central park. </span>\n<em>\n<span>There it was.\u00a0</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0When he arrived, what was normally a lovely park was wildly overgrown into an ominous, dark forest. The magic around here was\u2026 malevolent. Tasted like anger and\u2026 corpses. That (literally) magically grown forest looked like the kind of forest from fairy tales, where parents warned their children not to go in, and anyone who did was never seen again except for screaming in the forest on the anniversary of their disappearance.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0\u2026Maybe Billy had been reading too many spooky stories. Point was, that forest was really, really suspicious. Billy had a feeling that\u2019s where the Leshen was prowling. And if it thought that he was stupid enough to try to engage with it in its own territory, it had another thing coming.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0Fire. Specifically it had fire coming. A fire spell in the hands of a beginner could be far more dangerous than one in the hand of an expert, if only for sheer unpredictability. And with Billy\u2019s power? Yeeaahh, Danny made him learn multiple water spells before he even let Billy </span>\n<em>\n<span>touch </span>\n</em>\n<span>a fire spell.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cHello, Mx. Leshen?\u201d Billy called, \u201cI\u2019m going to ask you to please leave under your own power, before I force you. The harm caused to me and mine is cause for expulsion from my territory. It is simply a matter of how peacefully you go,\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0The park was silent. The wind that tousled Marvel\u2019s hair didn\u2019t touch the leaves on the darkening trees. He blinked, and suddenly he was in the dark forest, leaves canopying over his head and smothering any possible sunlight.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0Billy sighed, and discharged a burst of electricity that cracked sharply against the ground. The illusion faded away. \u201cThe hard way it is,\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0A wave of vines erupted from the ground, lashing out at Marvel. He dodged up into the air as they struck out. Marvel grabbed them and ripped them from the ground, before lashing out in return with a wave of electricity that naturally channeled into the ground. If the Leshen was hiding underground nearby, it should be affected. And if the multi-layered, earsplitting screeching coming from a nearby copse of trees was any indicator, it was.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0Captain Marvel threw a second wave of lightning into the trees where the screeching was, and they exploded under the impact. The forest </span>\n<em>\n<span>screamed</span>\n</em>\n<span>, a sound so terrible it could only be magically enhanced. Marvel winced, resisting the urge to cover his ears.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0It was only because he continued to listen beyond the faint ringing in his ears that he picked up on the movement behind him. Marvel dodged to the side, ragged, wooden claws just barely missing where he had been.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cSo, you finally show yourself, huh?\u201d Marvel asked, lowering himself as he raised his fists.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0The now revealed Leshen </span>\n<em>\n<span>hissed </span>\n</em>\n<span>in a way that echoed in Marvel\u2019s head. It was lowered to all fours, gangly limbs disproportionate so that they towered and hinged above where its own crouched body was. Its face was like a deer skull mask made of mossy, decayed wood. Moss and vines dangled off of its skeletal, primordial body.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0Both Marvel and Billy had seen nature spirits before. But this one seemed\u2026 decayed. Unhealthy. Almost emaciated. Even nature spirits separated from their source of power didn\u2019t have this level of </span>\n<em>\n<span>wrongness </span>\n</em>\n<span>to its aura. This felt more like a being that went against its nature\u2026 and was now paying the consequences.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0Billy let none of these thoughts show, and cocked an eyebrow instead. \u201cI know you're intelligent enough to speak. How about we have a polite conversation instead of growling at each other?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0The Leshen grumbled lowly, before standing up, and in a rumbly, echoing voice, began to speak. \u201c</span>\n<b>Champion of Magic</b>\n<span>,\u201d It hissed, \u201c</span>\n<b>You will not be leaving this encounter alive</b>\n<span>,\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI\u2019ve heard that one before. Any particular reason you\u2019re targeting me?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0The Leshen growled and tossed its head, wooden jaw clattering in aggravation.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201c</span>\n<b>The False King seeks to persecute me, and I will not allow him to do so. I will kill you, and paint my message in your blood. I will not be stopped</b>\n<span>,\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0Billy scowled. Was it just targeting him to get to Danny? It sounded more and more like this was the escaped prisoner Danny was looking for. Billy hoped Danny would show up soon. Though it seemed like Billy would have time. The Leshen was monologuing.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201c</span>\n<b>I am eons old, my domain wide. The people I killed and the souls I ate have fueled my power, this young upstart will not undo me and my effort. I am powerful, beyond your will and comprehension. I will see that upstart who overthrew Pariah Dark kneel before me in despair, knowing that I have consumed the flesh and soul of his son-</b>\n<span>\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI\u2019m sorry, you\u2019re going to do what?\u201d Phantom said suddenly from behind the Leshen, flicking his ghostly tail and narrowing his eyes, rarely utilized crown spinning idly over his head.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0Billy wasn\u2019t afraid to admit he was embarrassed about the result of the next few seconds. Now matter how happy he was at Danny\u2019s appearance, Marvel shouldn\u2019t have let his guard down.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0The Leshen had suddenly </span>\n<em>\n<span>screamed</span>\n</em>\n<span>, and vines erupted from the ground. Marvel didn\u2019t react in time, and got punched in the face by a vine. Phantom had dodged, and lunged towards where Marvel was reeling. The vines scrambled up Marvel\u2019s arms, thorns stabbing through his skin and into the lightning beneath.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0Billy yelped and attempted to throw the vines off, but they just scratched deeper and tore his skin further. Phantom seized the vines and froze them solid. Marvel broke them seconds later, the magic vines shattering into pieces. Another vine jumped straight at Phantom, but he grabbed it without even looking. Ice began to creep up the vine towards the Leshen that had thrown it from its own body.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201c</span>\n<em>\n<span>You,</span>\n</em>\n<span>\u201d Phantom seethed. The Leshen tried to pull away, but it couldn\u2019t pull its vine back. \u201cYou </span>\n<em>\n<span>hurt</span>\n</em>\n<span> my son,\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0The Leshen appeared to cower before the slowly encroaching ice, before coming back to itself with a snarl. \u201c</span>\n<b>No less than you deserve, you pretender-</b>\n<span>\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0The ice darted forward and encased half of the Leshen. It cut off with a pained hiss of anger. \u201c</span>\n<em>\n<span>No one </span>\n</em>\n<span>deserves the pain you inflict, much less my son,\u201d Phantom looked away, </span>\n<em>\n<span>looked away </span>\n</em>\n<span>back to Billy. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d Phantom, Danny, his </span>\n<em>\n<span>dad, </span>\n</em>\n<span>asked softly. Billy rubbed at where his lightning sparked over his skin and past the confines of his form. Phantom didn\u2019t wait for any further answer and glared back at the Leshen.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI want to make one thing clear,\u201d Phantom spoke, voice as cold as the ice that continued to creep along the terrified Leshen, \u201cYou could have perhaps found amnesty in the courts of the Infinite Realms. All you had to do was cooperate. Instead, you took the mercy granted to you in the interim, and used it to break out of the Realms. You targeted my home, my </span>\n<em>\n<span>family. </span>\n</em>\n<span>This could have been so much easier. And now I\u2019m going to have to freeze you over and drag you back to the realms for a much </span>\n<em>\n<span>harsher</span>\n</em>\n<span> justice,\u201d Phantom released the vine, and floated closer to the frozen Leshen.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cOh, and one last thing,\u201d Phantom continued, before seizing the base of the vine and </span>\n<em>\n<span>snapping. </span>\n</em>\n<span>\u201cIf you ever touch my family again,\u201d He intoned over the screaming of the Leshen, \u201cI will rip you apart molecule by molecule,\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0Phantom tore open a portal and Sparta kicked the still screaming Leshen through.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0Marvel laughed a little hysterically. \u201cThanks for the help, Phantom,\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0Phantom rolled his shoulders and shrugged. \u201cHe was my problem to begin with. I\u2019m sorry he came after you. Thank you for helping, Flash,\u201d Billy startled and looked to the side. Flash was there, looking a little terrified and a little gobsmacked.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cAh! Yeah, thank you Flash! I hope the minions weren\u2019t too much trouble for you,\u201d Billy smiled.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWh- Oh, yeah. No problem, man. I came to find you when the wolves collapsed. Got here right before Phantom kicked him through a portal. Uh, where, exactly, did it go?\u201d Flash asked awkwardly.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cThe Infinite Realms. It's going to be put on trial. Again. For even more crimes,\u201d Phantom sighed and rubbed the bridge of his nose. \u201cThis is going to be </span>\n<em>\n<span>such </span>\n</em>\n<span>a headache,\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI\u2019d imagine, but uh. Follow up question. What\u2019s the crown for?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0Billy was struck with the sudden realization that he\u2019d never told the League that Phantom was High King of the Infinite Realms. And all that entailed. Marvel looked to Phantom. Phantom looked at Marvel. They spoke in unison.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cShit,\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>************</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cSo, are we going to talk about-\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cNot right now Flash. Later. I need to help with cleanup first,\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cOh, good point! But, uh, you\u2019re kinda\u2026\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWhat?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cSparking?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cOh. Yeah. That happens sometimes,\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0J\u2019onn J\u2019onzz was an intelligent man, but he was not the kind of man that could work </span>\n<em>\n<span>in</span>\n</em>\n<span> Intelligence. He didn\u2019t have the correct skills to work in intelligence on Mars. If he ever expressed this to his friends on the Justice League, J\u2019onn knew they would be confused. He was such a powerful telepath, after all. What they seemed to consistently forget was that </span>\n<em>\n<span>all</span>\n</em>\n<span> Martians were telepaths.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0It wasn\u2019t the strength of the telepathy that mattered, it was how well you could shield yourself. Both from others hearing you, and you hearing others. J\u2019onn had never been good at shielding his mind. He was always naturally open; it was simply his nature.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0On Mars, that was not a bad thing. Though his \u2018ears\u2019 were more open, the people around him knew how to shield well enough for it to not matter, beyond the occasional headache or sensory overload.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0But here? On earth? Where mental shielding was a </span>\n<em>\n<span>rarity </span>\n</em>\n<span>instead of being common? J\u2019onn could have been one of the most well informed people on the entire planet. No person\u2019s mind was entirely closed from him. He could enter any person\u2019s mind with a bit of effort, tear it to shreds to find what he wanted.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0But he didn\u2019t. He didn\u2019t go looking for secrets, unless it was for the safety of others. He never caused damage to people\u2019s minds purposefully, and if he did he always tried to fix it. And he tried not to overhear his friends and coworker\u2019s thoughts.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0Emphasis on tried.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0Even after all these years, he wasn\u2019t much better at shielding. And while they may not be telepaths, it didn\u2019t stop his friends from being\u2026 mentally loud. Some projected. Heavily. So no matter what he wanted, J\u2019onn would overhear their thoughts anyways.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0J\u2019onn had asked Clark how he avoided overhearing people\u2019s secrets. But Clark, despite his best attempts, had been ultimately unhelpful. J\u2019onn could not simply \u2018tune them out\u2019. He could not let the noise fade to the back of his mind or \u2018dial down\u2019 his telepathy. Though J\u2019onn may liken his telepathy to hearing, it was ultimately not the same.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0His friends were polite about it, and accepted what he could or couldn\u2019t do. They accepted that trying his best was the best he could do. \u201c</span>\n<em>\n<span>Besides,\u201d </span>\n</em>\n<span>Flash had joked, \u201c</span>\n<em>\n<span>We don\u2019t get mad at Bats for knowing our secrets, and he looks for them on purpose!</span>\n</em>\n<span>\u201d Batman had not deigned to acknowledge that comment at the time, but later he had reassured J\u2019onn that even he, one of the most secretive of the League, bore no ill will towards J\u2019onn. It also likely helped that Batman was one of the few who </span>\n<em>\n<span>had </span>\n</em>\n<span>mental shields.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0So, no matter what secrets J\u2019onn overheard from his friends, he never shared them. Never.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0This occasionally left him in a predicament. Sometimes he mentioned an anecdote his friend had never told someone before. J\u2019onn had simply overheard it. Those led to some very awkward pauses. Or those times J\u2019onn desperately wished to advise his friend on a personal issue they had, but J\u2019onn could say nothing. His friend hadn\u2019t asked for advice, and if they wanted J\u2019onn to know, they\u2019d tell him.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0Or, a situation like this. Where J\u2019onn had the information, but simply no clue what to do with it.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0Like the fact that Captain Marvel was a child named Billy. Or his \u2018child\u2019 was an adult named Danny. Captain Marvel, like most human children J\u2019onn had encountered, was a loud presence. J\u2019onn had known his coworker was a child since the first time J\u2019onn had looked Marvel in the eyes, and caught the high pitched, whispered thought, </span>\n<em>\n<span>I really hope he doesn\u2019t find out I\u2019m ten.\u00a0</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0J\u2019onn\u2026 hadn\u2019t known what to do with that. His coworker was a child. Captain Marvel was a child with almost godlike power. A hero, who had already operated for quite some time and caught the attention of the League.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0J\u2019onn had told no one of his discovery, but instead watched. And listened. He shouldn\u2019t listen in on the minds of others, unless someone was in danger. But every second Captain Marvel spent with the League meant he was in danger, so J\u2019onn forgave himself.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0What he discovered was that nothing would stop Captain Marvel from being a hero. Billy was a highly selfless individual, and would work to help everyone he could, no matter if he had help or not. That was what tipped J\u2019onn over into telling no one.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0If J\u2019onn told the League and Captain Marvel was kicked out, Billy would still work as a hero. He just wouldn\u2019t have the resources of the Justice League. He wouldn\u2019t have a support system. He wouldn\u2019t have backup. Billy would be alone. So J\u2019onn told no one.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0Instead, J\u2019onn tried to make it clear he was always available to Captain Marvel. J\u2019onn tried to stay a calm, steady presence to Billy. J\u2019onn simply remained </span>\n<em>\n<span>kind</span>\n</em>\n<span>.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0And then J\u2019onn started catching stray thoughts of someone named Danny. How cool he was. How nice he was. How much Billy wanted to trust him. It was reassuring to know Billy had someone to rely on in his civilian life.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0And then, it was only after he learned that Billy had moved in with Danny that J\u2019onn discovered that Billy had been homeless the entire time. It was\u2026 shocking, to J'onn, that he had never realized this before. And it was shameful as well. How had he never realized? He was a telepath, and Billy was so easy to read! So how could he miss it?</span>\n<span>\n<br>\n<br>\n</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0It was a humbling realization, when J\u2019onn realized that he never knew because Billy simply never thought about it. J\u2019onn couldn\u2019t have picked up a thought on his predicament if Billy simply never thought about it. It was J\u2019onn\u2019s own assumption that anything significant would be at the forefront of someone\u2019s mind that was J\u2019onn\u2019s fall. He didn\u2019t like it, but he did appreciate the reminder.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0Telepathy wouldn\u2019t convey everything. J\u2019onn couldn\u2019t </span>\n<em>\n<span>know</span>\n</em>\n<span> everything. And he didn\u2019t want to. He had fallen into a trap of his own hubris, growing enticed at the thought of the power of knowledge. He had allowed his resolve to slip, covering it in the name of concern for Billy, when instead he had simply enjoyed letting his control slip and allowing himself to overhear and know as much as he could.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0J\u2019onn had carefully reeled in his mind, as much as he could, and any time he was tempted to listen in to his friend\u2019s thoughts out of concern, J\u2019onn reminded himself that it wasn\u2019t effective, nor was it what he wanted. Telepathy may have been the normal state of Mars, but on Earth it was a power, one J\u2019onn could not allow himself to abuse. These days, J\u2019onn only heard what was too loud or too close for him to not hear.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0And the fact that Phantom was Danny was a thought practically shouted into J\u2019onn\u2019s mind at the fateful meeting. And then even more so when Phantom came to the Mentors and Mentees night. Phantom\u2019s mischief had come through in every glee filled thought that brushed against J\u2019onn\u2019s peripheral.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0And now Phantom was on the Watchtower once more, hovering and fussing over Captain Marvel despite the visible wounds Marvel had sustained in his fight having long since subsided. Captain Marvel bore the fussing with only mildly embarrassed grace.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0J\u2019onn\u2026 wasn\u2019t quite sure why they were all there, to be honest. Phantom had a crown. This, on its own, would not be an issue. But instead, Phantom and Marvel treated it as a big deal, which caused the others around them to treat it as a big deal.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0And now they were here. In a conference room on the Watchtower, conspicuously not in the larger meeting room they usually used. However, the group gathered there was not a complete meeting. J\u2019onn actually hadn\u2019t been asked along at all, he had simply been on the Watchtower and joined the group when he had not been turned away.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0Among their number was Aquaman, who had kindly come in when asked despite still being on the tail end of his parental leave. Wonder Woman was there, as well as Batman. Flash was also there, as the person who stumbled across whatever secret this was first.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0Captain Marvel and Phantom were at the head of the conference table, having dragged their chairs to be next to each other. Marvel was nervously drumming his fingers on the table, which echoed in the silence once Phantom sat down and stopped fussing.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0Ditditditdit. Ditditditdit. Ditditditdit. </span>\n</em>\n<span>Phantom reached over and put his hand over Marvel\u2019s. \u201cCalm down, you\u2019re starting to give me anxiety,\u201d Phantom grinned.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0Marvel rubbed the back of his neck sheepishly. \u201cSorry,\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0Phantom rolled his eyes good naturedly before turning back to the rest of the table, smile fading. \u201cSo. Since this whole thing is, well, my problem, I\u2019ll kick things off. Most of you have been asked here for your specific backgrounds, or relevant skills,\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0Batman narrowed his eyes. \u201cAre you in trouble?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cNnno? Uh, depends on your definition of trouble. We\u2019re focusing on the non-combative part of the Justice League\u2019s purview,\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0Wonder Woman cocked her head. \u201cOur disaster relief?\u201d She asked.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cNo,\u201d Phantom replied bluntly. \u201cYour international and intergalactic diplomacy peacekeeping, liaisons, and missions,\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0Flash drew in a breath. \u201cOh,\u201d He breathed, \u201c</span>\n<em>\n<span>Oh,</span>\n</em>\n<span>\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0Phantom inclined his head regally. \u201cYeah. Would you mind telling me what parts you heard, at the end of our encounter?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI got there at the \u2018make one thing clear\u2019 part. Y\u2019know. The threats. And, uh, something about amnesty and justice? And the crown,\u201d Flash gestured above his head.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cCrown?\u201d Aquaman asked.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYeah. </span>\n<em>\n<span>My</span>\n</em>\n<span> crown. I\u2019m not here as Captain Marvel\u2019s family. I\u2019m here as Heir Apparent Phantom of the Infinite Realms,\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0There was a beat of silence. Batman steepled his hands in front of his face, adopting a face of contemplation. Flash was staring. Aquaman and Wonder Woman had straightened in their seats, their mental auras hardened into the miens of authourity that J\u2019onn associated with the powerful and politicians.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI was unaware that Pariah Dark had taken an heir,\u201d Wonder Woman said carefully, eyes flickering to Marvel.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0Phantom loudly thought, </span>\n<em>\n<span>absolutely not. </span>\n</em>\n<span>When he spoke, it was far calmer than his own internal thoughts. \u201cNo. By the Right of Conquest as dictated by the Infinite Realms, I unseated Pariah Dark and as such took his title and all that came with it,\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cThen why, if I may ask, have you not attained the High King title?\u201d Aquaman asked, voice diplomatic.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI\u2019m too young to inherit, of course,\u201d Phantom smiled wryly. J\u2019onn could sense his amusement at the irony, given they thought he was a teenager instead of an adult.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0Wonder Woman and Aquaman focused in on Captain Marvel. \u201cThen, as his parent, are you\u2026\u201d Wonder Woman trailed off.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0There was a sudden burst of hilarity, coupled with Marvel suddenly cackling. Phantom giggled and covered his face with his hands. J\u2019onn quirked his lips, finding their amusement infectious. Of course they found it funny, that when told someone was too young to fully inherit, they turned to a person, in fact, younger than them, and asked if they were in charge instead. \u201cHah! No, no. I\u2019m\u2026 I\u2019m not eligible. Conflict of interest as Champion of Magic, you see. And also the whole \u2018not being dead\u2019 thing,\u201d Marvel grinned.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0Wonder Woman nodded sagely. \u201cI understand. Heir Apparent Phantom, who then, is your regent?\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cDon\u2019t have one,\u201d Phantom chirped.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cAnd why not?\u201d Aquaman asked, brow furrowed.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI\u2019m going to eventually be </span>\n<em>\n<span>High </span>\n</em>\n<span>King. You could technically say I </span>\n<em>\n<span>do</span>\n</em>\n<span> have a Council of Regents, in the form of the many rulers and their various kingdoms. Right now, my responsibilities amount to anything that the rulers bring up to me specifically, or anything that would affect the entire Realms. The Infinite Realms survived for over 6,000 years without Pariah Dark. It can wait for me to reach the age of ghost majority, and survive with only my occasional input,\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cIf that\u2019s the case, then why are you meeting with us?\u201d Batman asked.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0Phantom sighed. \u201cPart of what I do, is occasionally preside over what you would consider our felon cases,\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cSo, that\u2019s what the tree monster was?\u201d Flash piped up for the first time.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cExactly. It escaped holding and targeted Marvel as my family in order to threaten me into submission. That, of course, didn\u2019t work,\u201d Phantom smirked, but soon fell back into a frown and quieter mindset. \u201cThe reason I\u2019m bringing this up is\u2026\u201d Danny sighed and rubbed his forehead. \u201cI\u2019m not sure how to put this,\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0Marvel put his hand on Phantom\u2019s shoulder. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d He asked softly.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201c</span>\n<em>\n<span>No,</span>\n</em>\n<span>\u201d Phantom replied miserably. \u201cI\u2019ve hardly slept this last week, the trial was really complicated and I hardly knew what I was doing, and then it </span>\n<em>\n<span>broke out, </span>\n</em>\n<span>and </span>\n<em>\n<span>attacked you, </span>\n</em>\n<span>because of </span>\n<em>\n<span>me. </span>\n</em>\n<span>And to top it all off, we\u2019re going to have to restart the trial </span>\n<em>\n<span>all over again, </span>\n</em>\n<span>because it has now committed </span>\n<em>\n<span>even more crimes,</span>\n</em>\n<span>\u201d Phantom sighed heavily. \u201cI\u2019m </span>\n<em>\n<span>so tired,</span>\n</em>\n<span>\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0Marvel pulled Phantom into his side, embracing him with one arm. \u201cHow about I talk about it. I know a bunch from you ranting about it a ton. I can fill them in on the situation, and then you can do your whole big king diplomacy,\u201d Marvel poked Phantom in the side, and he giggled before elbowing Marvel in the side.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cAlright,\u201d Marvel started, acting like he didn\u2019t have a ghost nestled into his side, sitting on the arm of his chair, \u201cSo the first thing you got to know is that one of the greatest crimes in the Ghost Zone is to end another ghost or otherwise undead. Ghosts and other people of the Infinite Realms are extremely hard to kill. You really, </span>\n<em>\n<span>really </span>\n</em>\n<span>have to be trying to permanently end someone. Another one of the worst crimes is to touch a ghost\u2019s core. It is the center of their being, the most intimate part of them, pretty much their </span>\n<em>\n<span>soul</span>\n</em>\n<span>. It\u2019s all they are, were, and ever will be. To mess with a ghost\u2019s core is one of the worst things you can do. However, killing </span>\n<em>\n<span>humans </span>\n</em>\n<span>is uh,\u201d Marvel shrugged. \u201cThe legality of it depends on your region,\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0Flash\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cOh. That\u2019s uh\u2026\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYeah, a lot of them generally view humans as like\u2026 I don\u2019t know, there\u2019s really no one to one comparison. Maybe apes? They generally look at people as animals with above average intelligence,\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cAnd what about non-humans?\u201d Wonder Woman challenged, raising her chin in defiance.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cDepends,\u201d Phantom spoke up, leaning out of Captain Marvel\u2019s side, looking more collected than he did moments before. \u201cIf a denizen of the Infinite Realms were to kill an Amazonian or Atlantean, there would be consequences. You\u2019re god people, and when you live in a place where there are a large amount of dead or death gods, there\u2019s a general taboo. There\u2019s enough powerful people to put that line in the sand and back it up. However, </span>\n<em>\n<span>aliens,</span>\n</em>\n<span>\u201d Phantom winced and glanced at J\u2019onn. \u201cI managed to get a ban on not hunting endangered species like Martians or Kryptonians at least. There\u2019s a hunter in the local area of the Zone who focuses on rare or unique species. Generally trying to get their pelts on his wall,\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cThank you for ensuring I am not legally hunted for sport,\u201d J\u2019onn said dryly.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0Phantom chuckled nervously and rubbed the back of his neck. \u201cUh, you\u2019re welcome, I think. None of that\u2019s to say that there are a lot of ghosts out to kill people. There are some, but those are generally motivated by vengeance, particularly when the alive person can be blamed for their demise. But overall, there isn\u2019t much killing of the living, not when the chance of them just coming back as a ghost and getting you back is a possibility,\u201d Phantom blew out a breath. \u201cNow, the issue with Leshen, wasn\u2019t the fact that it was killing humans and subsuming them into its forest,\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cHe was </span>\n<em>\n<span>what,</span>\n</em>\n<span>\u201d Batman growled. Phantom did not look intimidating.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cIt, not he,\u201d Phantom corrected off-handedly. \u201cAnd it\u2019s part of Overgrowth\u2019s purview. It wouldn\u2019t get in trouble </span>\n<em>\n<span>just </span>\n</em>\n<span>for that. No, the problem was it was </span>\n<em>\n<span>eating the souls and developing cores </span>\n</em>\n<span>of the people it consumed,\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWhich, as said before, is one of the felony crimes of the Infinite Realms,\u201d Aquaman said.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0Phantom nodded. \u201cExactly so. And the reason it was brought up to </span>\n<em>\n<span>me </span>\n</em>\n<span>and made an entire Infinite Realms issue was that fact that it has been doing it for a </span>\n<em>\n<span>long </span>\n</em>\n<span>time. If you were to look up the Okhotsk-Manchurian Taiga, you\u2019d get a lot of longstanding stories on how it\u2019s haunted and people go missing in it. The reason no one noticed until now was because Leshen left no clues, and most ghosts don\u2019t pay attention to humans and their local stories. We found out because of Ghost Writer, a ghost who\u2019s constantly looking for more stories to expand his collection. He came across the stories and followed them to their source. The Leshen tried to absorb him. It was pure </span>\n<em>\n<span>luck</span>\n</em>\n<span> that he had a powerful protection charm on him from his last search. Ghost Writer made it back to the Zone, and investigation was launched, and,\u201d Phantom spread his arms, \u201cNow we\u2019re here,\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cThank you for the information, Heir Apparent Phantom,\u201d Wonder Woman acknowledged. \u201cWe appreciate the knowledge of the reasoning behind the attack, and the information that such a powerful ruler spends his time on Earth,\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s more than that,\u201d Phantom drummed his fingers on the table, much like his son had earlier, before straightening up. \u201cI would like to offer the Justice League the assistance of the Infinite Realms in searching the Okhotsk-Manchurian Taiga for the remains of Leshen of Okhotsk-Manchurian Taiga\u2019s victims,\u201d Phantom said officially.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cDo you have knowledge of the victim\u2019s locations?\u201d Batman asked.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cNo, but I have more </span>\n<em>\n<span>friendly</span>\n</em>\n<span> nature spirits at my command who can assist in detection and unearthing them,\u201d Phantom replied.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0Wonder Woman inclined her head. \u201cWe will make the request to the Russian authorities for permission to enter their land and search. We thank you for your offer of assistance, Heir Apparent Phantom, and would be most grateful for your assistance in the matter,\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0Phantom nodded sagely, and the table briefly descended into serious, contemplative, silence. The ghost then relaxed and leaned back into Marvel\u2019s side, and gave a weak grin. \u201cI\u2019m done with all the official stuff now,\u201d Phantom gave a mock salute, \u201cAt ease,\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0Wonder Woman snorted. \u201cYou comport yourself well, Phantom. I have met many a politician and ruler less composed and respectable than yourself,\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI have also met politicians, and I completely agree,\u201d Phantom snorted.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cImagine becoming the enemy,\u201d Marvel grinned.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI\u2019m not a </span>\n<em>\n<span>cop,</span>\n</em>\n<span>\u201d Phantom grinned back.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI would say not all cops, but I know that it wouldn\u2019t go over well,\u201d Batman rumbled. J\u2019onn thought he remembered something about Batman\u2019s eldest becoming an officer, so that made sense that he would make an attempt at standing up for the profession, despite belonging to one of the most corrupt cities on Earth.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0Phantom perked up. \u201cBatman made a joke, I can\u2019t believe it, I saw with my own two eyes and heard with my own two ears, Batman. Make an actual joke,\u201d He grinned, beaming mischief and joy like a child.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0Batman simply grunted and stood up. He nodded to the inhabitants of the room and swept out in a wave of darkness. J\u2019onn thought he could, maybe, faintly, detect embarrassment from Batman as he stalked past. J\u2019onn smiled, and looked back to the others.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0Everyone except him was standing up now, conversing idly. Aquaman was speaking with Flash, who was asking question after question a mile a minute on how Mera was doing, and the kid, and him, and the kingdom, and the sea, and his city, and and and\u2026</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0Wonder Woman was showing off her sword and a whetstone to Captain Marvel and Phantom, who both looked enthralled.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0J\u2019onn settled in his seat and looked at the joy and contentment he could see. Yes, he did not need to over use his telepathy to know the state of things. He could simply wait and see. And it could be all the more satisfying for it.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0\u2026</span>\n<em>\n<span>as said before, for anything short of the active, literal end of the world, do not contact me.</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0Billy paused. Was that too rude? Hmmm, nah. This was just him making sure he really emphasized the point. The point being \u2018please have someone watch over Fawcett while I\u2019m unavailable.\u2019</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0Thank you for your understanding. I will contact you again in a week.</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0Sincerely, Captain Marvel</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0Billy quickly read over his email again. Going out of contact for a week, can someone please deal with Fawcett if it\u2019s being actively attacked, don\u2019t even look in my direction unless the world is actively ending, blah blah blah. Yeah, that sounded about right.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cBilly?\u201d Danny called nervously from the other room. Billy hit send without even looking.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI\u2019m coming!\u201d He called, pattering over quickly. Danny was sitting on the living room\u2019s pull out couch, surrounded by a nest of blankets and pillows. His skin was pale and his eyes shot with green, leaning heavily into Jazz\u2019s side. He wordlessly made a grabbing motion, and Billy wormed his way between Sam and Tucker to slide into Danny\u2019s arms.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0Danny pulled him close, folding his arms around Billy in a protective embrace. Billy sighed and snuggled closer. \u201cBetter?\u201d He asked.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cBetter,\u201d Danny confirmed, voice muffled from where his face was buried in Jazz\u2019s shoulder. At least he wasn\u2019t nonverbal yet. That was a good sign. Billy knew it wouldn\u2019t last long. It never did, around Danny\u2019s Death Day.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0Last year, the first time Billy had been around for it, Danny had explained it to him like this: around a ghost\u2019s Death Day, more specifically the week surrounding it, their instincts and obsession would slowly be dialed up to eleven. However, they\u2019d also be bedridden with the pain of their death, causing them to be practically powerless. Danny had a protection obsession. He also had a highly agonizing death, causing him to pretty much be paralyzed a quarter of the way in. Not being able to move, combined with a protection obsession was\u2026 volatile. At best.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0Danny said on his first Death Day he had broken into Sam and Tucker\u2019s houses, kidnapped them, and crashed in Jazz\u2019s room, barring the door and refusing to let anyone enter or leave. Or at least trying to, because he had hit his limit soon after and was reduced to a shaking, agonized mess.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0After that\u2026 yeah, they learned how to adapt, and it pretty much came to: hole up in one room with a pile of snacks and water bottles, an adjoining bathroom, and don\u2019t leave for the entire week.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0Danny had wrung his hands when he told Billy. </span>\n<em>\n<span>I\u2019m going to be really clingy, and physically affectionate. But I\u2019ll also be in a lot of pain. I understand if you\u2019re not comfortable staying with me during that.</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0Will it hurt you if I\u2019m away? </span>\n</em>\n<span>Billy had asked. Danny hadn\u2019t done him the disservice of lying.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0Yes. But I\u2019m the adult here. It\u2019s not your job to deal with my issues. I\u2019ll have Sam, Tucker, and Jazz with me, so you can crash at their place for the week instead of being here. </span>\n</em>\n<span>Danny had said.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0Billy had hid his nerves, and resolutely shoved himself into Danny\u2019s side. </span>\n<em>\n<span>A hero doesn\u2019t leave people in pain when they can help. </span>\n</em>\n<span>He had said.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0Danny had hugged Billy in return, and whispered, </span>\n<em>\n<span>you\u2019re a good kid.</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0It had been unnerving, and a little uncomfortable. He was constantly around people, the entire time, unable to leave for longer than five minutes without Danny dissolving into heart wrenching sobs. But Billy had stuck out the cuddles, and the whimpers of pain, and the feeling of being an intruder in such an intimate scene, and spent time with his new guardian. In the end, Billy felt like their relationship came out stronger for it. Danny was there for Billy when he needed it, and it had been his turn to reciprocate.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0And now it was a year later, and Billy was in a blanket nest with his dad, aunts, and uncle. And he </span>\n<em>\n<span>knew </span>\n</em>\n<span>he belonged. Danny\u2019s body suddenly wracked with a violent tremble, and he whined in pain.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0Jazz shushed him quietly, running her fingers through Danny\u2019s hair. \u201cWe\u2019re right here, little brother. We\u2019re all right here,\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cNnno,\u201d He slurred. \u201cWh\u2019r\u2019s Jason?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cOn his way, Danny,\u201d Sam reassured, glancing at her phone screen. \u201cAny minute now,\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0There was a knock on the door, and Billy moved to go get it, but didn\u2019t get more than a foot before Danny was yanking him back into his lap. \u201cI guess that means I\u2019ll get the door?\u201d Tucker snickered. Billy flipped him off and he escalated into full blown guffaws.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0Sam simply rolled her eyes and got off the bed with a quick pat to Danny\u2019s shoulder.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0She yanked open the door, grabbed Jason by his shirt, and tugged him in. Jason yelped and frantically tried not to drop the pile of take out containers in his arms. \u201cHey, watch it!\u201d He exclaimed.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cNo,\u201d Sam replied with a smirk. Jason rolled his eyes, but then immediately snapped his gaze over when Danny whined. \u201cDanny?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0Danny simply made a grabbing motion and looked piteously at Jason. Jason shoved the take out containers into Sam\u2019s arms and marched over to Danny. Danny shoved his head into Jason\u2019s side, latching onto his shirt with ferocity.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWow,\u201d Jason said, sounding concerned, \u201cYou really weren\u2019t kidding,\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cW\u2019dn\u2019t joke \u2018bout this,\u201d Danny mumbled incoherently.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI know,\u201d Jason said, awkwardly smoothing a hand through Danny\u2019s hair.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0Jazz smiled with a tired understanding. \u201cHe gets cuddly like this. It\u2019s okay if you need a break every once in a while,\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cPssh, I\u2019ve gotten worse from Dick\u2019s octopus hugs,\u201d Jason dismissed. \u201cIt ain\u2019t a crowbar or an exploding warehouse: I\u2019ll live,\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0Billy smiled. It felt good to see how much better Jason had gotten about his death in the time he\u2019d known the family. It probably had a lot to do with having someone who understood, plus a side of actually getting enough ectoplasm to not have his core constantly cannibalizing his sanity. Who knew \u2018Pit Rage\u2019 was a side effect of ectoplasm deprivation? Well, not Jason, and it took Danny dragging Jason halfway through their acquaintanceship to Frostbite to actually get an answer, and a solution.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYour Death Day was last month, right? How did it go?\u201d Jazz asked.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cThey were just happy I wanted to spend time around them. They\u2019re all equally clingy around then, so they didn\u2019t think I was weird,\u201d Jason\u2019s face screwed up in a grimace. \u201cI\u2019m not looking forward to when I get enough ectoplasm in my system to actually </span>\n<em>\n<span>feel </span>\n</em>\n<span>it, rather than, y\u2019know,\u201d Jason waved his hand idly.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cThe extreme emotional instability that bordered on insanity and manifested in extremely violent ways?\u201d Tucker asked dryly, briefly looking up from his current favouite PDA.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYeah, that,\u201d Jason shrugged.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cMind telling me what\u2019s in these?\u201d Sam asked, hefting the precariously stacked containers that had been shoved at her.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cGuess,\u201d Jason said, smirking.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cKosher tofurkey burger on rye, no cheese, and extra lettuce, a four meat cheeseburger, extra bacon, a classic cheeseburger, no onions, chicken caesar salad, dressing on the side, chicken fingers with barbeque sauce on the side, a chicken nuggets kids meal, and enough french fries to turn someone\u2019s blood into gravy,\u201d Tucker rattled off easily.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0Jason blinked. \u201cI was going to say \u2018dinner\u2019, but yeah. That,\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYou have our orders memorized?\u201d Billy asked, because yeah, he\u2019d heard that enough times to know whose was whose.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0Jason blushed and scowled. \u201cI\u2019m a Bat. Of course I know everything. But how did </span>\n<em>\n<span>you </span>\n</em>\n<span>know that?\u201d Jason accused Tucker.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0Tucker simply held up his PDA in a toast. \u201cSubtle, you are not, my friend,\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0Jason rolled his eyes. \u201cI know a non-answer when I hear one. But yeah. Fine,\u201d Jason flopped down in front of Danny. \u201cI\u2019ve officially put myself on blackout mission status. No one\u2019s going to try to talk to me or try to look for me for the next week,\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cIs that something you can do?\u201d Billy blinked. \u201cI just told the Justice League that I\u2019d be unavailable except for emergencies,\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0Jason snorted. \u201cNo, you did the correct thing. If you said what I said you\u2019d freak everyone the fuck out,\u201d Jason grinned sharply. \u201cBlackout missions generally mean undercover infiltration, where someone you know trying to contact you could get your cover blown, with a major side of killed,\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cAnd Captain Marvel doesn\u2019t have a single unsubtle bone in his body,\u201d Billy nodded in understanding. \u201cThey only tried to put me on a civilian recon mission once. I showed up in a trench coat and a fedora over my suit, because, well, it doesn't come off. They sent me home,\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0Jason dissolved into, frankly, unwarranted laughter. It wasn\u2019t </span>\n<em>\n<span>that </span>\n</em>\n<span>funny.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0Sam rolled her eyes and started passing around take out containers. The food was, somehow, still hot. Danny grabbed his container of chicken fingers and started shoving them into his mouth like he was a black hole.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cBreath, little brother,\u201d Jazz said, patting Danny lightly on the back. Danny only mildly slowed down.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201c\u2018M \u2018ungry,\u201d Danny mumbled through a mouth full of food. Jazz rolled her eyes.</span>\n<span>\n<br>\n<br>\n</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI can see that,\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>****************</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cTruth or dare?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cHmm,\u201d Billy tapped his chin, \u201cTruth,\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWhat\u2019s the weirdest thing you had to eat on the streets?\u201d Jason asked.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWell, after I became Captain Marvel, but before I met Danny, sometimes magic creatures would try to give me stuff? As thanks, after I saved them. Some I declined, some is, like, somewhere in the Rock of Eternity, but they\u2019ve also given me food too,\u201d Billy said. \u201cOne time, this pack of werewolves gave me jerky, which tasted really awesome. I asked them what it was, and they told me it was Leprechaun jerky. I was too scared to ask if they meant made </span>\n<em>\n<span>by </span>\n</em>\n<span>Leprechauns or made </span>\n<em>\n<span>of </span>\n</em>\n<span>Leprechauns. I\u2019m still too scared to ask,\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWhat did it taste like?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cIt was magically delicious,\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cBilly!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>***************</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWhy. Why would you do this to me?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s not the end of the world, Tucker,\u201d Sam scoffed.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0Tucker waved his handfuls of Uno cards wildly. \u201cMaybe not for you it isn\u2019t! I fucking hate this game,\u201d Tucker continued drawing, until he finally grabbed the one he needed. \u201cFucking finally,\u201d Tucker moaned, placing down his red reverse.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0Jazz maintained her usual poker face she had in all games, whether or not there were any stakes. She maintained direct eye contact with Tucker as she put down a red reverse as well, sending the turn back to Tucker.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI fucking hate this family!\u201d Tucker cried out.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>*****************</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cBreath Danny, you still need to breathe. You\u2019re still alive,\u201d Jazz cajoled in a quiet whisper.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0Danny, beyond the reaches of coherency or speech, was holding his breath while a scream stirred in his chest. It was alarming. It was worrying. It was heartbreaking. And there was nothing Billy could do about it except burrow into Danny\u2019s embrace and tap a beat onto Danny\u2019s arm, hoping that it would somehow reach him through the haze of pain.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0Danny\u2019s chest finally moved from the forcefully still tremble he had had before, but the air in his lungs only came out in a pained wheeze, like he\u2019d been stabbed. He gulped in a lungful of air, and the next exhale came out as a pained cry.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0Billy winced and blinked tears out of his eyes. This was the </span>\n<em>\n<span>worst. </span>\n</em>\n<span>Well, yeah, it was the literal worst it could get, but really, the entire thing </span>\n<em>\n<span>sucked. </span>\n</em>\n<span>He just wanted Danny to stop hurting, but there wasn\u2019t anything he could do about it. Not any further than he already was. Or the rest of the family either.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0Danny was tucked to Jazz\u2019s chest, and Billy to his. Sam and Tucker were sitting on either side of Danny, like they always did. This year, their newest addition. Was sitting in front of Billy, hands on Danny\u2019s legs, facing them. Danny was entirely surrounded by people who loved him. But he was still in so, </span>\n<em>\n<span>so </span>\n</em>\n<span>much pain.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0Gods, Billy hated this. But he could never hate Danny. Never.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>***********</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYou need to eat </span>\n<em>\n<span>something, </span>\n</em>\n<span>Danny,\u201d Sam said pleadingly. Danny simply whined and hid his face in Jazz\u2019s shoulder.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI know, man, I know,\u201d Jason soothed, running his fingers through Danny\u2019s hair. \u201cBut you gotta have </span>\n<em>\n<span>something</span>\n</em>\n<span>. If solids aren\u2019t good, I can heat up some soup?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0Danny huffed and grabbed Jason, pulling him into a hug. Jason sighed and patted his back. \u201cYeah, yeah, love you too. God, you\u2019re worse than Dick when he\u2019s sick,\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWhat am I, chopped asparagus?\u201d Sam grumbled, but obligingly moved towards the kitchen. The great thing about an open floor plan was that Danny could see everyone pretty much no matter where they went, so at least Sam going to the kitchen wasn\u2019t distressing.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>*****************</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cHey Jason?\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYeah?\u201d Jason looked up from where he was zipping up his jacket. They\u2019d made it to the end of the week, once again. Sam, Tucker, and Jazz had left late the evening before, since they had work the next morning. Jason had stayed one more night. Danny had said that he could leave too, but Jason had declined.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0Billy thought it was because Jason, on some level, had enjoyed their sleepover. The good parts, at least. The entire week, not a single one of them had nightmares, besides Danny, and with some of their occupations, nightmares were a bit of a given. Billy thought that people slept better when they felt safe, and what was safer than being with the people you love?</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cThanks for coming over, man. You didn\u2019t have to,\u201d Danny said, leaning against the wall.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWhat? No, of course I did. You\u2019re my friend and I care for you, of course I\u2019ll be there for you,\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0Jason said that so simply, like it was a matter of fact. Billy hugged Danny\u2019s waist when he sighed and leaned heavily on the wall.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWish my parents had said something like that,\u201d Danny said morosely.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0Jason paused. \u201cYou never really talk about them,\u201d Jason said cautiously.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0Danny shrugged limply. \u201cI\u2019m fine telling you. It only hurts some days. When I came out to them as Phantom, they told me to leave and never come back,\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cOh,\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYeah. I was prepared for a lot worse. They said if they ever saw me again, they\u2019d treat me exactly like they treated the rest of my kind,\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cShit man,\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0Billy tightened his arms around Danny\u2019s waist. Danny shrugged again. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t bother me as much as it used to. But, it means a lot to me. That you\u2019re here,\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0Jason strode forward and wrapped his arms around Danny\u2019s shoulders. They were about the same height, but Jason was bulkier in the shoulders, which made it easy for him to engulf Danny in his embrace. \u201cYeah. I\u2019m here. And I\u2019ll keep coming back, whenever you need me. I\u2019ll drop whatever, just to be with you. Because whatever else is family good for?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0Danny buried his face in Jason\u2019s shoulder and hugged back. Billy leaned his head on Danny\u2019s hip and smiled.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0Yeah. Family. A family could be a half dead adult, a psychiatrist who gave therapy to her own family, a plant witch, the reincarnation of an ancient pharaoh, the Champion of Magic, and a crime lord. And it could be great.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0Billy wouldn\u2019t have it any other way.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0Some days Sam wondered why Gotham hadn\u2019t just stopped giving doctorates in any of their universities. Honestly, how many Rogues had a doctorate? The answer was too many, and they should\u2019ve given up on higher education a long time ago. But that would require Gotham to be </span>\n<em>\n<span>sane </span>\n</em>\n<span>or to have </span>\n<em>\n<span>common sense, </span>\n</em>\n<span>which it didn\u2019t, of course.</span>\n<span>\n<br>\n<br>\n</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0But then again, who was Sam to talk? She\u2019s the one who voluntarily chose to move here. Granted, Jazz had already been there for two years, because she had chronic \u2018I can fix him\u2019 syndrome and decided to apply that to Arkham Asylum. Tucker hadn\u2019t even bothered with university because he had made enough of a name for himself in the white hat hacker community and got himself an offer at Wayne Industries right out the gate.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0Sam could\u2019ve gone many places, and Gotham wasn\u2019t supposed to be particularly high up on the list, but she was there anyways. Why? It was\u2026 complicated. And probably best summarized by her relationship to Dr. Pamela Isley, aka Poison Ivy.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>**************</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0Most people generally didn\u2019t put protests on their vacation itinerary, but since when has Sam cared what most people do? Activism was her idea of a good time, and she didn\u2019t care what her parents said. They\u2019d thought they were compromising by bringing Sam to Gotham in the summer before her senior year. Sam got to see all the gothic architecture, and in return she\u2019d shmooze with Gotham\u2019s upper class, right? Wrong.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0Sam wasn\u2019t afraid to climb out of her hotel room window and three stories to the ground, she\u2019d done crazier with Danny. And she wasn\u2019t afraid to go participate in the various kinds of protests in Gotham. Marches? She\u2019s there. Sit ins? Sign her up. Petitions? Her name was on it.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0It had all gone surprisingly well, which should\u2019ve indicated something was going to go wrong.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0And it did. The protest outside a factory with illegal waste dumping practices had been going well, until the factory blew up.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0For a moment Sam had worried that something had gone catastrophically wrong with her Undergrowth powers, as vines writhed and overtook the factory in seconds. But then she remembered where she was.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0This wasn\u2019t Amity Park where the only person around with plant powers was her. This wasn\u2019t Amity Park where the ambient ectoplasm from the portal made her powers extremely reactionary to even mildly strong emotions. This wasn\u2019t Amity Park. This was Gotham, and there was a very well known, very powerful plant user with a vendetta against people and corporations that harmed nature.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0Poison Ivy.\u00a0</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0Sam\u2019s fellow protestors had been walking past her, calmly adjusting their gas masks that any self respecting Gothamite had, but Sam only had eyes for the beautiful, destructive green rapidly overtaking the factory. The vines grew and lashed out, winding and twisting and </span>\n<em>\n<span>breaking </span>\n</em>\n<span>chimneys like snapped necks. Moss crawled like a tide of insects, seeping through cracks and mortar. Flowers bloomed, spitting out clouds of coloured pollen which swept like a glittering breeze across the factory.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0It was terrifying. It was dangerous. It was awe inspiring. It was </span>\n<em>\n<span>beautiful.\u00a0</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0Sam\u2019s experiences with plant powers had so far been Undergrowth (traumatic) and the tenuous control she had over her own plants (more difficult than it was gratifying). But now? Now she had an example of what it </span>\n<em>\n<span>could </span>\n</em>\n<span>be. And it was </span>\n<em>\n<span>amazing. </span>\n</em>\n<span>Sam didn\u2019t know what it would take to meet Poison Ivy, but in that moment, she knew she would do damn near anything to meet her new idol and, hopefully, learn how to use her powers like she did.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>**************</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0Five years, one bachelor's degree in botany, and starting her graduate degree later, Sam had her chance. Well, technically not really, but honestly it was the university\u2019s fault for not being more specific on what it meant to \u2018mentor under an expert in your field\u2019 as one of its requirements. They definitely meant an internship or job at some kind of flower shop, or, at best, the environmental department at Wayne Industries. Not apprenticing under an ecoterrorist.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0What a shame that they didn\u2019t word it specifically enough to keep Sam from searching out Dr. Isley. Really, they only had themselves to blame. Sam was a young, impressionable mind, how was she supposed to know that hunting down a rogue to teach her the ways of chlorokinesis wasn\u2019t what they meant? It wasn\u2019t against the rules either. The law? Yes. The university's rules? No. And the university\u2019s own rules said that they couldn\u2019t discriminate against students based on their criminal records. If they were, say, in jail and missed too many classes, then yes, they could be kicked out. But if they kept everyone with a criminal record out, there\u2019d be no one left to attend the university.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0Nonetheless, Sam had no intentions of being caught.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0It was easier to find Poison Ivy than she thought it\u2019d be. Honestly it was a little embarrassing. All it\u2019d taken was bullying Tucker into finding her last known location, and then picking the closest, largest patch of nature in that area. Again, embarrassing. The Box Ghost had hid his tracks better in the past than Poison Ivy, via simple reverse psychology that one time he\u2019d hid in a circular room rather than, y\u2019know, a cube room.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0Sam had met no resistance when she walked into a dilapidated, overgrown cottage, until a thorny vine had surged forward and curled around her throat, inches from her skin. Well. It seemed she was right.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cAre you lost, little girl?\u201d Poison Ivy purred threateningly, which Sam hadn\u2019t even known was possible in real life, which, </span>\n<em>\n<span>awesome.</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cNo. I\u2019m exactly where I want to be,\u201d Sam said calmly. Fangirling would not be conducive to getting what she wanted.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWhat are you, some kind of vigilante? Running in with a half cocked plan? That\u2019s won\u2019t work, little girl-\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cSam,\u201d Sam interrupted, \u201cMy name is Sam. I\u2019m working on my graduate degree in botany and I\u2019d like for you to mentor me, Dr. Isley,\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0Poison Ivy stared at Sam, before bursting into raucous laughter. \u201cHah! Haven\u2019t heard that one before. What a weird tactic for a sting operation the Bats are employing this time,\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI\u2019m being serious. You can find my student ID in my pocket,\u201d Sam gestured to the coat pocket where her wallet was.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cThat wasn\u2019t the issue. Little girl, why would you possibly think that </span>\n<em>\n<span>I\u2019m </span>\n</em>\n<span>what, willing? A good option? Please, find a better lie,\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cDoctor Isley, I\u2019ve read every paper of yours I could find. Your treatise on revitalizing endangered species of fungi was </span>\n<em>\n<span>inspired. </span>\n</em>\n<span>You\u2019re dedicated, passionate, and not afraid to defenestrate someone for what you believe in. You\u2019re </span>\n<em>\n<span>amazing. </span>\n</em>\n<span>I wouldn\u2019t be able to find anyone half as interesting as you to mentor under, and,\u201d Sam paused, biting at her bottom lip. She flattened her palm towards the floor, reaching and </span>\n<em>\n<span>feeling. Seeds, leaves, compost, dead wood from planks, grass, lichen, and right there, that little bit of green-</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0Poison Ivy stared at the floor beneath Sam as a curl of vine grew out from between the floorboards. Hardly something of remark if she had made it. But she didn\u2019t. Sam did, with a shaky grasp and more determination than skill.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI\u2019ve seen your work,\u201d Sam continued, \u201cAs Dr. Isley and Poison Ivy, and both sides are </span>\n<em>\n<span>incredible. </span>\n</em>\n<span>I want to be like you, and learning under you is my best chance,\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0The cottage was silent. Sam had said her piece, there wasn\u2019t anything else she could do. Poison Ivy rolled her eyes. \u201cYou\u2019re not the first meta, plant growing hopeful that\u2019s approached me. I\u2019m not more impressed with you than I was them. But how about I make you a deal,\u201d Poison Ivy walked forward, hips swaying with confidence. \u201cBring me the seed of an extinct plant species, and I\u2019ll teach you anything you want. But until then, you don\u2019t show your face to me, and if you do, I\u2019ll tear your face off. How does that sound, little girl?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0Sam\u2019s lips twitched, and she grinned. Wide, sharp, and a little crazy, just like every other Amity Parker. \u201cSounds like you\u2019ve got a deal, Dr. Isley,\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>*************</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s been a week, is your memory so bad you\u2019ve already forgotten what I </span>\n<em>\n<span>said</span>\n</em>\n<span>- what\u2019s this?\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cA lepidodendron cone,\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201c...The lepidodendron tree went extinct over 250 millions years ago,\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI\u2019m aware,\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cHow the fuck did you get this, kid?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0Sam grinned. \u201cBribery, blackmail, and a couple threats of defenestration,\u201d Mostly targeted towards Danny, plus a little bit of time travel, but Dr. Isley didn\u2019t have to know any of that. \u201cSo. When do I start?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0Poison Ivy stared at Sam, then the rigid spore container in her hands. Up. Down. Back up. Poison Ivy sighed and pinched the bridge of her nose. \u201cFuck it. How do Saturdays at three work?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>*************</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0Sam knocked on Pamela\u2019s door and heard the barking of Harley\u2019s hyenas, shouting, and some minor crashing. The usual sounds when she came over. She\u2019d been Pamela\u2019s \u2018apprentice\u2019 for five years, and she\u2019d loved every moment of it, including when she\u2019d gotten introduced to Harley after she\u2019d broken up with the Joker.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0Speaking of Harley, she whipped the door open, balancing on one foot as she used the other to push Bud and Lou back. \u201cHey! Red\u2019s favourite plant baby! Back from your sabbatical, huh?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0Sam rolled her eyes and pushed her way in, ignoring the fond smile she could feel creeping on her face. \u201cIt was just a week, Harley. I only missed one girls night,\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cExactly! Criminal!\u201d Harley exclaimed, shutting the door behind them. \u201cWe missed ya, Selina especially! Ya\u2019ve got the longest hair, and she wanted to try this new fangled braid style she learned, and ya weren\u2019t there!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cIs that Sam?\u201d Pamela poked her head out from around the corner, mouth quirking up at the edges when she saw her. \u201cGood to see you. Come on, we\u2019ve got </span>\n<em>\n<span>Legally Blonde</span>\n</em>\n<span> ready to go as soon as Selina\u2019s here,\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201c</span>\n<em>\n<span>Legally Blonde</span>\n</em>\n<span>? I thought it was </span>\n<em>\n<span>Mean Girls </span>\n</em>\n<span>tonight?\u201d Harley asked, trotting over to Pamela and pecking her on the cheek.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cIt would be, if that fucking time loop a month back didn\u2019t fuck up our schedule,\u201d Pamela said. \u201cNow let Sam out of the foyer, will you?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0Sam smiled as she took off her shoes, hanging them up on the shoe rack to keep Bud and Lou from stealing them.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0Gotham was smelly, dark, and not exactly far enough from Amity Park for her tastes. Her parents kept pestering her to go to literally any gala in the area, no matter how much of a hotspot for rogue attacks they were. Tucker kept forgetting to put the toilet seat down and Jazz kept breaking in to steal their coffee creamer. But Pamela gave fantastic hugs and taught her how to take no shit more than standing up to her parents did on its own. And Harley helped Sam dye her hair, no matter how much of a hassle it was, given its length. And Selina took Sam to all the good thrifting shops in the area.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0And Sam felt so, so loved. And that\u2019s what kept her coming back.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0Billy woke up on his thirteenth birthday feeling no different than he had the evening before. Not that he ever had, really. Billy was pretty sure that birthdays didn\u2019t work like that for anybody. But if there was one thing that marked this birthday as different, it was this was the first one Billy had with Danny as his dad. Danny had been there for the last one, but Billy had still barely known him at the time, and didn\u2019t let him do anything more than take Billy out to his favourite diner and give him a scarf.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0It was Billy\u2019s favourite scarf, now.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0But even though Billy didn\u2019t feel any older, that didn\u2019t mean he didn\u2019t keenly feel the difference between this one and the last. He didn\u2019t wake up cold, he woke up underneath warm blankets and a stable roof. He didn\u2019t eat a whole granola bar that he\u2019d saved specifically for his birthday. He woke up to Danny putting a plate piled with pancakes on the table. He didn\u2019t wake up alone. He woke up to Danny giving him a smile and a hug and a kiss on the forehead.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0Billy didn\u2019t wake up feeling any different than he had yesterday. He woke up feeling loved.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cHow\u2019s my big teenager feeling?\u201d Danny teased.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0Billy rolled his eyes. \u201cI\u2019m exactly the same as I was yesterday,\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cAre you sure? I think you might\u2019ve grown a whole foot,\u201d Danny waved his hand over Billy\u2019s head with a grin. Billy rolled his eyes again and batted Danny\u2019s hand away. \u201cAny plans for today?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0Billy raised an eyebrow. \u201cNo. Besides my usual patrols, that is,\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cGreat! We have a lunch date,\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWith who?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cThat\u2019s a surprise,\u201d Billy rolled his eyes again. \u201cYour face is going to get stuck like that, y\u2019know,\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cNo it won\u2019t,\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYes it will,\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cNo it won\u2019t,\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYes it will,\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201c...You\u2019re a dork, Dad,\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cThanks!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>***************</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cElle!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cDanny!\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0Billy grinned as Elle stood up from the diner table, wrapping Danny in a hug and squeezing tightly. \u201cHow are you?\u201d Danny asked, returning the hug.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWe\u2019re doing great! I\u2019m sorry I missed your Death Day,\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s okay. There\u2019s no way any of us could have predicted underwater vampires building a portal to an alternate universe,\u201d Danny turned to Kon, who was sitting stiffly in the booth, \u201cThanks for keeping Elle safe. I rested a lot easier knowing that she had someone with her,\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cUh, no problem, sir?\u201d Kon rubbed at the back of his neck.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cDon\u2019t call me sir,\u201d Danny waved his hand dismissively, \u201cYou can call me Danny, or Mr. Danny if you have to,\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cUh, alright, Danny. And, um,\u201d Kon looked at Billy, \u201cCaptain Marvel?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0Billy grinned. \u201cBilly. And Kon, right?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYeah,\u201d He paused, \u201cNone of them really know?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cNope,\u201d Billy said, with what he thought was only a little bit of smugness. After all, it wasn\u2019t everyday a ten year old fooled the entire League. And kept it up for three years.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cCome on sit down,\u201d Elle cajoled, \u201cThis brunch won\u2019t eat itself,\u201d Elle sat back down next to Kon, and Danny and Billy slid into the seats across from them.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cBilly!\u201d Aisha called, walking over with her notepad in hand. \u201cNice to see you, and your dad. These two more of your family?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYeah! This is my aunt Elle and my cousin Kon,\u201d Billy smiled, happy to see his old friend. Aisha had always been really nice to Billy, giving him leftovers when he was homeless and couldn\u2019t afford to pay. This was where Danny had taken him the year before. Billy was happy to come back for his birthday.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cNice to meet ya\u2019, when can I get you started on?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0Billy happily kicked his feet as his family ordered their drinks. This was shaping up to be a great birthday.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYou, uh,\u201d Kon hesitated as Aisha walked away.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d Billy tilted his head.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYou called me your cousin,\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0Billy had? He hadn\u2019t even been thinking about it. \u201cOh. Uh, yeah. Since Elle pretty much, um adopted you, and at least that\u2019s what I thought\u2026 It\u2019s okay if you don\u2019t want to be my cousin, I\u2019m sorry if I made you uncomfortable,\u201d Billy fiddled with the menu in front of him, unable to look Kon in the eye. He was so embarrassed!</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cUm, it\u2019s okay,\u201d Kon said, rubbing at the back of his neck. \u201cI don\u2019t mind. I\u2019ve never really had a family before, so I don\u2019t really know how it works\u2026 But it\u2019s fine if you want to call me your cousin,\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0Billy perked up and grinned. \u201cCool! This isn\u2019t the first family I\u2019ve had, but I can tell you it\u2019s a good one,\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0Kon glanced over at Elle. \u201cYeah, I can tell,\u201d He suddenly blushed and looked away. \u201cSo!\u201d He said, a little too loudly, \u201cWhat\u2019s good here?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cThe blueberry pancakes are awesome here,\u201d Billy said.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cBut their spiced veggie omelets are good too,\u201d Elle added.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI think I\u2019m going to go with a chicken parmesan today,\u201d Danny said, closing his menu and sliding it into the middle of the table.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cBut aren\u2019t those\u2026,\u201d Kon trailed off.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWhat\u2019s confusing you, kiddo?\u201d Elle said with the ease of refrain.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cThose are breakfast foods. And also lunch and dinner food. Why can I have both at the same time?\u201d Kon looked baffled.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cThat, my dear nephew, is the magic of brunch,\u201d Danny grinned slantedly. \u201cIt\u2019s both breakfast and lunch! Best of both worlds,\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cPancakes, omelets, salads, sandwiches, soups, sides, they\u2019ve got it all,\u201d Elle chimed in.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0Kon looked down at the menu like it was a venomous snake. Or like a venomous snake with kryptonite fangs, since regular snakes wouldn\u2019t be able to pierce his skin. \u201cThat\u2019s a lot of options,\u201d He said slowly.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYeah. How about I point out some of my favourites, and you can pick which sounds good. We can always come back later. Add it to your bucket list: try every single food at Sally\u2019s Diner. We got time,\u201d Elle replied easily.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYeah. Yeah, we\u2019ve got time,\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0Billy kicked his feet happily, the tips of his sneakers barely skimming the floor. He remembered the first time he came here with Danny, after the very first time they had met. Billy had been so nervous, constantly feeling a thrum of </span>\n<em>\n<span>gogogo </span>\n</em>\n<span>in his veins. He didn\u2019t know how to stay still and let the time pass. He never felt like he had enough time.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0There was always the worries of being a hero, and a member of the Justice League, and the Champion of Magic, and homeless, and a kid. There was always somewhere to go, something to do. Schedule a meeting with Justice League Dark, show up for Monitor Duty with the main part of the Justice League, hop into a parallel magic dimension to negotiate a treaty between two warring factions of fae adjacent folk, figure out where he was going to sleep since he got kicked out of his last place by the police, meet up with Freddy at the park and play and deflect any mentions of going back into the system. Billy never had the time to </span>\n<em>\n<span>stop.\u00a0</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0Because it felt like the moment he did, he wouldn\u2019t be able to do it anymore. And he wasn\u2019t. He slowed down. He paused, he stopped, to meet up with Danny. Pop by and say hi, just because he could. Get ice cream and sit in silence, feeling the rest of the world go by. Laying down in Danny\u2019s guest room when he didn\u2019t have anywhere to go where he wouldn\u2019t freeze to death in one of the worst winter storms Fawcett had ever seen.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0He slowed down, he stopped, he </span>\n<em>\n<span>breathed. </span>\n</em>\n<span>And then he collapsed. Not as catastrophically as it could have been, not with Danny to catch him. But he didn\u2019t patrol as much as he did before, not when he had actual, stable, timed meals to get to. He didn\u2019t volunteer for as many Monitor shifts as he had when he had no one to go back to. He didn\u2019t make every meeting anymore because now he had preexisting plans, someone to </span>\n<em>\n<span>do </span>\n</em>\n<span>things with.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0He wasn\u2019t constantly on the move anymore. He wasn\u2019t always </span>\n<em>\n<span>gogogoing </span>\n</em>\n<span>with nary a pause. He didn\u2019t do quite as many things as he did before, he didn\u2019t spend as much time as a hero, as </span>\n<em>\n<span>Captain Marvel. </span>\n</em>\n<span>But he couldn\u2019t help but feel like he was a better hero for it. He was sleeping more, yes, but he wasn\u2019t as tired when he had to fight. He spent less time as a hero, but that meant he had the energy to be there faster when he was needed. He wasn\u2019t just connecting to himself as Captain Marvel, but as </span>\n<em>\n<span>Billy Batson.\u00a0</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0The Wisdom of Solomon was just as important as the Stamina of Atlas as the Strength of Heracles as the Speed of Mercury as the Strength of Zeus as the Courage of Achilles as the Heart of Billy Batson. He\u2019d practiced and developed his powers and gifts from his patrons, but in doing so, Billy Batson had fallen to the wayside.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0But as he thought, and Solomon agreed, Captain Marvel would not be Captain Marvel if it weren\u2019t for Billy Batson. There had been dozens, hundreds, </span>\n<em>\n<span>thousands </span>\n</em>\n<span>of Champions of Magic before. Each was different in how they handled their powers, each were unique in what they did with their abilities, and every single one brought something different to the title of Champion of Magic. Billy was no exception. There were no Champions before that were like him, and there weren\u2019t going to be any after him who would be. There would be Champions after Billy, that was entirely undisputed, but there would never be another </span>\n<em>\n<span>Billy.\u00a0</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0It was important to be himself, it was </span>\n<em>\n<span>good </span>\n</em>\n<span>to be himself, with all that entailed. It was good to spend time with Danny, and go to school, and sleep eight hours a day, and watch movies, and make friends with Freddy\u2019s new foster siblings. It was good to take time. To be him. To do good. To be more than just a hero, a member of the Justice League, the Champion of Magic. He was more than all those things. He was something amazing, that no one else had ever been or could ever be again.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0He was Billy Batson.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0And he had time.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0This is the way the world ends. Not with a bang but a whimper. </span>\n</em>\n<span>It was the opposite way for Billy, and how his lies collapsed around him.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0Well, that sounded a little bit dramatic. Not that most of his life wasn\u2019t dramatic, theatre seemed to be an essential component of being either a superhero or a supervillain. No, Billy meant it in a literal way. His unwilling reveal was the product of a whole lot of noise all at once, and then a whole lot of silence right after.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0He wasn\u2019t making any sense, was he. Well, it made perfect sense to Billy, but literally any of those words in that conjunction would only confuse his poor coworkers, and hopefully, somehow, after all of this, friends, further. Better to figure it out in his own head so he could lay out the facts that much easier.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0Billy and his dad had just finished waving off Kon and Elle, who after brunch had to leave for Kon\u2019s first appointment with Frostbite, because no one was sure if Kon was vaccinated, needed to be vaccinated, could develop more powers as time progresses, could </span>\n<em>\n<span>lose </span>\n</em>\n<span>powers as time progresses, etcetera.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0Danny and Billy had been about to go home, when Billy\u2019s comm rang. The League needed help with a series of magical, hydra-esque creatures who just wouldn\u2019t stay down, and who better to help with a magical problem than Captain Marvel?</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0And it had been working. Really well, actually. Apparently all that it took to keep the animated army of animalistic, old pottery shards from multiplying when they\u2019d been broken had been to, y\u2019know, zap \u2018em. With the discovery that magic was the most important factor, his colleagues had turned to herding the monsters towards him and Zatanna.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0More towards him, really. If there was one thing that godlike powers and nigh unlimited magic was good for, it was wanton destruction. He was tearing through them, clay shattering to dust as his lightning branched out and struck them, leaving behind black lichtenbergs; which wasn\u2019t strictly scientifically possible, but it was magic lightning on magic clay, so who knew?</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0It was going just fine. Up until the charred, shattered remains rattled and swirled into a ramshackle kaiju. There was someone, a wizard, a sorcerer, just some guy with a spell book, shouting out his evil monologue, but Marvel hadn\u2019t been listening.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0The way it fell, Zatanna, Batman, and Martian Manhunter went to fight the evil magic dude, while Superman and Flash went with Marvel to fight the giant monster.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0It hadn\u2019t been going well. Anytime Superman or Flash got a hit in, it healed just as quickly. And whatever effectiveness Marvel\u2019s lightning had had, it had waned in strength, like reparation for its earlier power.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0They\u2019d hoped that once the dollar store wizard was taken down, the magic would collapse without the structure of a caster. Captain Marvel along with Superman had focused on trying to pin the monster and keep it from destroying the buildings around it, while Flash, almost simultaneously, served as civilian evacuation, and the occasional distraction for the bargain bin sorcerer (Billy bet Danny would have lots of creative nicknames to share with him later, if Billy asked).</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0The porcelain creature did not collapse when its creator went down. In fact, it only seemed to be getting stronger. They weren\u2019t panicking, not yet, but the potential for it was there.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0Billy hadn\u2019t thought about it, not really. His thoughts, and maybe a little bit of Solomon\u2019s and Zeus\u2019, about lightning, and how even when the monster\u2019s parts cracked apart and came back together, the scorch marks stayed, flitted past at Flash level speeds.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0He didn\u2019t stop to consider what he was doing, hesitation on a battlefield was a terrible idea, and Captain Marvel was more impulse and power than thought and skill like Batman.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0So, with power flowing through Captain Marvel, and the Wizard\u2019s name on his lips, Billy Batson came back into the world at the same time that the clay monster shattered into dust-to-pebble-sized flecks.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0Unfortunately, when Billy inhaled to call the Wizard\u2019s name again before he, y\u2019know, hit the ground, he got a lungful of magic monster dust. Hard to say anything when you\u2019re attempting to cough out at least half of your lung.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0Martian Manhunter caught Billy, as he emerged from the slowly drifting dust in freefall, and brought him down to the ground.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0They knew. They all had to know, they had to have seen Billy, and must be coming to their own conclusions, maybe even the right ones.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0The battlefield was silent in the wake of Billy\u2019s cacophonous lightning. He hoped it wasn\u2019t so loud that it hurt the others. He\u2019d never really transformed around other people, besides Danny, but Danny was an outlier in most things, so he didn\u2019t count.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0Billy stood on a pile of shattered and blackened pottery, feeling it crunch and grind under his sneakers, trying to not think too deeply on the weight of the stares around him.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cCaptain Marvel? Are you alright?\u201d Zatanna asked, picking her way around the various craters and piles of debris with a slight limp.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI-,\u201d Billy coughed, choking on the dry dust he\u2019d inhaled. Blegh, his mouth tasted awful. He shakily held up a thumbs up instead.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYou\u2019re\u2026 you\u2019re Cap?\u201d Flash asked shakily, staring at Billy.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0Billy breathed deeply to get his breath under control, and tried to think as quickly as he could. Lies swirled in his head, half formed plans of energy saving forms, latent curses, and simply refusing to give any answers inundated his brain. But all of it just left\u2026 a bad taste in his mouth. Beyond the clay, that was.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0He could lie, he could say a lot of things, Batman would figure it out of course, but he could fool the others, maybe. But\u2026 he didn\u2019t want to. He didn\u2019t want to lie to them, anymore than he already had. There was a difference between misdirection and omission, and straight up lying to their faces. He didn\u2019t want to lie anymore than he already had. It felt\u2026 bad. And he was tired of it. He\u2019d always thought he\u2019d be caught out, one day. Either he\u2019d say the wrong thing, or Batman would look too close, or, like now, he\u2019d sacrifice his secret identity to save the day, because people always came before secrets.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0So Billy straightened up and cleared his throat, swallowing back overwhelmed tears of anxiety, and smiled. \u201cYeah, Flash. It\u2019s me,\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0Silence. Dead silence.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0Billy ignored it. \u201cIs everyone alright? No injuries? Zatanna?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0Zatanna startled slightly. \u201cRolled my ankle a little, but it\u2019ll be fine,\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0Billy scrunched his nose. \u201cHeels, Zatanna. Why?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s for the </span>\n<em>\n<span>aesthetic</span>\n</em>\n<span>,\u201d She teased, smiling at their familiar argument.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWell maybe the aesthetic is stupid,\u201d Billy teased back. \u201cAnyone else hurt?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cNo,\u201d Batman said. He stared at Billy. Billy stared back. \u201cHow old are you?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cAs of today? Thirteen,\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cHappy birthday,\u201d Martian Manhunter said politely, from where he still stood at Billy\u2019s side. Billy\u2026 appreciated it.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cThank you. Now,\u201d Billy turned back to the rest of his\u2026 hopefully still coworkers, hopefully still friends, \u201cI know you have a lot of questions, but we still have a job to do right now. Can we all agree on that?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0There was a pause as people glanced at each other, before Batman nodded decisively. \u201cMarvel, Zatanna, work together to gather and contain any latent magical artifacts, as well as Xiefl Xanderghiest,\u201d Was that the magic guys name? Wild. \u201cSuperman, start moving debris, Martian Manhunter, assist him with anyone that\u2019s buried. Flash, medevac. I\u2019ll liaison with the police and get a perimeter set up,\u201d Batman spun on his heel, cape flaring dramatically behind him as he walked away. Billy had always found it impressive, and vaguely endearing, that Batman was always so confident that people would listen to him.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0Billy almost wished he had that decisiveness, but if he did, he wouldn\u2019t be him. He asked, and cajoled, and requested, but rarely ever commanded. It didn\u2019t feel right. He had all this power, godlike and eternal with the authority of an inherited mantle, it\u2019d be so easy to get people to listen to him. To obey him. Just because they were scared of his power, and Billy didn\u2019t want to be that person. He could never let himself be that person, allow Captain Marvel to be corrupted by his power.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0He wasn\u2019t a god, he was more than the Champion of Magic, he was Billy Batson, and one of the most important things about him was his </span>\n<em>\n<span>heart. </span>\n</em>\n<span>He wouldn\u2019t lose that. He refused.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0Even if this went awfully, if the Justice League kicked him out and he lost all of the friends he\u2019d made, he would continue to be a hero. He\u2019d be Captain Marvel, because that wasn\u2019t something he could stop being. He\u2019d continue to do good, and good would follow.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0After all, he wasn\u2019t alone. Zatanna and Constantine would help him if he asked, they\u2019d already known about his age. And he had his dad. And Sam, and Tucker, and Jason, and Elle, and Kon, they wouldn\u2019t abandon him. They cared for him, and he cared for them too.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0No matter what, Billy wasn\u2019t alone in this.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0No matter what.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0Tick. Tick. Tick. Tick.\u00a0</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0Billy wondered why there were analogue clocks in the Watchtower. With all the money poured into a high tech space station, why not spring for digital clocks?</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0Tick. Tick. Tick. Tick.</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0Well, people did have their phones. Well, most of them. Or maybe only some of them, they might just only take their comms up to the Watchtower.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0Tick. Tick. Tick. Tick.</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0Or maybe the designers wanted at least some areas that weren\u2019t purely dependent on technology. Magic and electric powers both tended to fuck with digital things, so maybe this was a compromise where they could?</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0Tick. Tick. Tick-.</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0Fuck it.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cSo,\u201d Billy clapped his hands together, making a startlingly loud noise. Whoops, big Captain Marvel hands made for a big clap, apparently. \u201cWho wants to start?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0The gathered Leaguers averted their gazes, and Marvel tried not to sigh. Honestly, this was ridiculous. They\u2019d had secret identity conversations before, this wasn\u2019t </span>\n<em>\n<span>that </span>\n</em>\n<span>different\u2026 Hopefully.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cNobody? Okay then, I\u2019ll start, and then you can ask questions. How does that sound?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cThat makes sense, Captain,\u201d Zatanna said, and Billy couldn\u2019t help but feel a rush of affection for her. He was glad he had people in the room who already knew, who would support him.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cAlright then. My name is Billy Batson. And when I was nine, I was chosen by The Wizard to become Champion of Magic. I used my abilities given to me by the Gods to be a hero for my city, Fawcett,\u201d Billy took a deep breath and let it out. \u201cA year after I started, I was approached by members of this League to join them. It was made expressly clear to me that sharing my identity was not required to be a part of the Justice League; only a desire to help people how I can and assist when others ask and I\u2019m available. Yes,\u201d Billy swept his gaze around the meeting table, meeting every pair of eyes he could, \u201cI covered up the fact that I\u2019m a kid. While it wasn\u2019t an explicit lie, it was still a lie of omission. And, given the opportunity, I can\u2019t say I wouldn\u2019t do it again,\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWhy?\u201d Flash blurted out, sounding slightly hurt and Billy smothered a wince. Anger he could deal with. Hurt was\u2026 far more difficult.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cBecause I don\u2019t know how this is going to turn out. I don\u2019t think any of you do,\u201d Billy sighed. \u201cWhen I joined the Justice League, I knew that my identity would come out one day. I\u2019d never be able to keep it up forever, and I didn\u2019t want to. But that didn\u2019t matter to me. What was more important was saving people, and being a part of the Justice League would allow me to save the most people I could. Even if my identity would come out sooner, even if I had to lie simply through inaction, I would do it because the most important thing, to me, was to save people,\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0There was silence around the meeting table. Billy averted his eyes. \u201cAnd, to be completely honest, I was scared,\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cScared of what?\u201d Diana asked, and Billy appreciated the lack of patronizing in her tone. She\u2019d made it clear before that she respected Captain Marvel as a skilled warrior and one of her Father\u2019s chosen mortals. Perhaps that respect hadn\u2019t entirely gone away.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cScared of the unknown. I was scared of what would happen if you, any of you, any adult hero, found out that I was a kid. I was afraid you\u2019d try to make me stop being a hero, stop being the Champion of Magic. I still am, but I\u2019m a lot more confident than I was then. And I\u2019d hope you know me better than that too. That you know that nothing short of death will keep me from being a hero, from using these powers that I have been given to be the best hero I can be. So if any of you are thinking of trying to prevent me from being a hero,\u201d Billy narrowed his eyes at the people around him, \u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cAnd, and please correct me if I\u2019m wrong, there was a fear that we\u2019d try put you back into the foster system, yes?\u201d J\u2019onn said carefully. Billy stared at him in shock.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cHow did you- oh. Right. Telepath,\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cThe discovery was accidental, I assure you,\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cHow long have you known?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cThree years,\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cThree years?!\u201d Flash shouted. \u201cYou\u2019ve known since the beginning?!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYou never said anything,\u201d Billy blinked in shock.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cIt was not my place to say anything. Any secrets I accidentally learn from my friends, I do not bring up,\u201d J\u2019onn said calmly. \u201cI do </span>\n<em>\n<span>not </span>\n</em>\n<span>make exceptions, for if I do it once, what\u2019s to stop me from doing it again? These are my principles,\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWe can talk about principles of power usage on a different occasion. That\u2019s not what we\u2019re here for,\u201d Batman said lowly.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cRight. Right. We\u2019re here for transparency. Okay. Yes, I was homeless for the first two years of being a hero,\u201d Billy put his hands on his hips. He refused to cross his arms, he refused to be defensive, he refused to be </span>\n<em>\n<span>ashamed </span>\n</em>\n<span>of his time being homeless. That resolve was born of many, many therapy sessions, but it was his resolve all the same.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell us? We would\u2019ve helped,\u201d Superman said.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cAnd what exactly is your idea of help? Putting me back in foster care? Forcibly sharing my secrets? Monitoring me? Trying to stop me from being a hero because I\u2019m \u2018too young\u2019?\u201d Superman said nothing. No one did. \u201cAnd that\u2019s why I didn\u2019t tell you. I\u2019m </span>\n<em>\n<span>very </span>\n</em>\n<span>familiar with the other end of \u2018for your own good\u2019, and more often than not, it doesn\u2019t turn out </span>\n<em>\n<span>very good</span>\n</em>\n<span>,\u201d Billy sighed and rubbed at his forehead. \u201cYou\u2019re my heroes. You have my admiration. You have my respect,\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cBut we don\u2019t have your trust,\u201d Black Canary said, perhaps a little sadly.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0Billy shrugged. And then nodded. \u201cI was scared. I didn\u2019t want my choices to be taken away, and I didn\u2019t want to fight you. Was I young when I started? Yeah. In over my head? Fuck yeah, I had no clue what I was doing. But I had to. There was no one else who could. And if you say that you can\u2019t relate to that, then you\u2019re lying,\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0There was silence around the meeting table for a moment. Batman had his hands folded in front of his face, not seeming to be looking at anything in particular. Superman was frowning at the table, Flash was leaning back in his seat and was either resting his eyes or staring at the ceiling, Hal was drumming his fingers on the table, and Green Arrow and Black Canary were having a silent conversation. Zatanna smiled when Billy caught her eye, and Diana simply nodded at him. J\u2019onn had his eyes closed, and might\u2019ve been suppressing a headache from being in close proximity to so many strong thoughts and emotions. Captain Marvel frowned. He should try to end this.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cSo. What happens next?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0No one looked at him. No one seemed willing to give him an answer. Except Batman.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWhat do you want to happen?\u201d He asked lowly, and Billy couldn\u2019t help but smile at him.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cPreferably? Nothing. Nothing changes. I come up for my Monitor Duty shifts, I help with missions, I come as backup when asked, and just help however I can,\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWhat about school?\u201d Flash asked.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cOnline, to catch up for the years I missed and to leave room for superhero things,\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYou said you\u2019re not homeless anymore. Do you have a guardian?\u201d Diana asked.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYes, and he knows about me being Captain Marvel and supports me how he can,\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWhat about friends?\u201d Green Arrow asked.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWell,\u201d Billy rubbed at the back of his neck, \u201cI think of you as my friends. And I understand how that might\u2019ve changed for you after,\u201d Billy waved his hand vaguely, \u201cThis. But I hope the way you view me hasn\u2019t changed too much. Yeah, as of yesterday I\u2019m thirteen, but I\u2019m still me. Having powers, I like to think, didn\u2019t change me too much. It just gave me the ability to do something about how I already felt,\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWell that\u2019s something pretty much every Green Lantern can relate to,\u201d Hal laughed bitterly, speaking up for the first time. \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure there are kid Lanterns out there. I mean, if a </span>\n<em>\n<span>cat </span>\n</em>\n<span>has enough rage to be a Red Lantern, then why can\u2019t kids have enough rage, willpower, or hope? I don\u2019t,\u201d Hal sighed and rubbed a hand over his face before making eye contact with Billy, \u201cI don\u2019t like this. I don\u2019t think kids should be anywhere near </span>\n<em>\n<span>this. </span>\n</em>\n<span>Near death experiences, fights, all of this shit. But I understand what it means to be chosen to do something that you were already willing to do, and not being willing to back down,\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0Everyone stared at Hal. \u201cThat was very poignant, Hal,\u201d Diana said.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI play the fool, but that doesn\u2019t mean I am one,\u201d Hal turned up his nose playfully.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYeah, you\u2019re just a wiseman who eats expired foods if they don\u2019t smell weird. Well, too weird,\u201d Flash teased.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cRude!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cBut accurate,\u201d J\u2019onn said, and Hal grabbed at his chest like he\u2019d been stabbed.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cDamn! Coming for me too, J\u2019onn?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI speak nothing but the truth,\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0Everyone, except Batman, chuckled at them, but Billy was pretty sure that he saw Batman smirk a little in amusement.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cSo that\u2019s it?\u201d Billy asked.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cThis does feel\u2026 a little easy?\u201d Superman said, sounding a little baffled.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWhy does it need to be hard?\u201d Zatanna asked, crossing her arms.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cIt doesn\u2019t need to be, but I gotta be honest I expected this to be more\u2026 emotional? Loud?\u201d Flash said.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cIt shouldn\u2019t be,\u201d Billy crossed his arms. \u201cLike, in my worst case scenarios I imagined there\u2019d be a lot of shouting, but worst case scenario doesn\u2019t mean likely case scenario. I can\u2019t say we\u2019re all adults here,\u201d Billy joked slightly and hoped it wasn\u2019t too soon, \u201cBut I can say we\u2019re all mature, rational people. We all know shouting isn\u2019t helpful. We all know that emotion and logic aren\u2019t always in line with each other. I hoped that we could talk through this instead of, y\u2019know, shouting, and we did,\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYou should know better,\u201d Batman growled at the people at the table, \u201cAnd you didn\u2019t prove me wrong. Good. Secret identities are just that: secret. We allowed for these secrets, and being mad when something unexpected happens is foolish. Captain Marvel is an exemplary member of the League who has proven time and time again to be both a good hero and a good person. The Justice League defends everyone, regardless of age, species, gender, or elsewise. It makes sense that anyone can defend people, regardless of age, species, gender, or elsewise. Agreed?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0No one spoke out against Batman. \u201cGood. Any further issues can be handled individually. Dismissed,\u201d There was a pause, where no one moved, and then Zatanna stood up.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cIt was nice seeing you, Billy. Tell your dad hi for me,\u201d And then she walked out.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYeah, uh, nice getting to know you better, Cap. I\u2019m going to ask for all the stories during Monitor Duty, though,\u201d Flash grinned tentatively, and then brightened when Billy smiled back. From there it was a steady stream of people leaving, tentative goodbyes backed by relieved smiles when Billy didn\u2019t dismiss them out of hand. He didn\u2019t know why they thought he would. Then again, their trust in him was shaken. And they\u2019d learned that his trust in them wasn\u2019t as strong as they thought it was.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0But maybe\u2026 no they </span>\n<em>\n<span>would </span>\n</em>\n<span>learn to trust each other. They\u2019d learn, and it\u2019d be stronger than it was before. It wouldn\u2019t necessarily be </span>\n<em>\n<span>easy</span>\n</em>\n<span>, but often the hard things had some of the best results. Billy smiled to himself and let his shoulders fall as he finally relaxed.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0That went\u2026 really good. Better than he expected it to. Better than his worst case scenario, better than his most likely case scenario, too. This was\u2026 good. It was good. He was good. </span>\n<em>\n<span>Do good and good will follow. </span>\n</em>\n<span>Billy appreciated the almost irony of his own phrase coming back to him in the best of ways.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cBilly,\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0Billy yelped and jumped slightly. Gods damnit, he\u2019d forgotten about Batman! Captain Marvel cleared his throat. \u201cBatman,\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI understand your motivations for keeping your situation hidden,\u201d He paused and Billy stared at him. Was Batman waiting for an answer?</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYes?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI hope that the reactions of the League allow for you to\u2026 come to us, if you have an issue again,\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cIf I can\u2019t handle it on my own, sure,\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0Batman stared at Billy. Billy stared at Batman. Batman sighed. \u201cBilly. I\u2019m saying\u2026 as a father, that if you need assistance, I\u2019m here for you. In whatever capacity you\u2019ll allow,\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0Billy couldn\u2019t help but smile softly. Batman was usually so stern and confident, but Billy really did like to see the human parts of him. The man who asked for help only when it came to his children, and stumbled over his words, and tried so, so hard even when it didn\u2019t work. Maybe especially when it didn\u2019t work.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI\u2019ll keep that in mind,\u201d Billy said, \u201cPromise,\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0Batman nodded firmly and swept past Billy, the end of his black cape swirling past like a flurry of socially awkward shadows.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0Billy stood alone in the meeting room for a moment, before drifting over to the windows. This side of the Watchtower was currently facing away from Earth, so all there was to see were stars.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0Lights of stars and suns and planets, all glinting together in a beautiful tapestry of ink. Together but still so far apart. How amazing was it, to live on a planet with so many people. To live on a planet saturated with magic. To live on a planet with humans and animals and Gods and aliens and </span>\n<em>\n<span>friends. </span>\n</em>\n<span>Of all the places in the universe, of all the </span>\n<em>\n<span>people </span>\n</em>\n<span>in the universe, Billy was here.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0Wasn\u2019t life amazing?</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0Billy\u2019s phone, that he\u2019d for once made sure to have on him as Captain Marvel, buzzed. Billy pulled it out of a pocket, which he was pretty sure his suit hadn\u2019t had before today, and looked at the notifications. Danny had texted him. Billy unlocked his phone and pulled up the text.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<u>\n<em>\n<span>Everything going well?</span>\n</em>\n</u>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0Billy smiled and texted his reply.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"right\">\n<u>\n<em>\n<span>We\u2019re done. It actually went better than I thought it would.</span>\n</em>\n</u>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<u>\n<em>\n<span>I\u2019m not going to say I told you so, but\u2026</span>\n</em>\n</u>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"right\">\n<u>\n<em>\n<span>Yeah, yeah, you were right.</span>\n</em>\n</u>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<u>\n<em>\n<span>They\u2019re good people, Billy.

They really were beautiful. Life was beautiful. And Billy was doing great. His phone buzzed again.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<u>\n<em>\n<span>So how did they take, y\u2019know, my whole situation?</span>\n</em>\n</u>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0 \u00a0\u2026Shit.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<span>Flash</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<span>to batman@justiceleague, captainmarvel@justiceleague, superman@justiceleague, wonde\u2026</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<span>RE: Phantom???</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Hey, so, I cc\u2019d everyone who was at the meeting here, because I literally just remembered, but Phantom?

My ghost form looks the same as when I died (do NOT ask any questions about my death, forward ghost etiquette questions to Zatanna or Constantine), while my human form continued to age. I may look like a 14 year old ghost, but it\u2019s way more accurate to call me 27. I am an adult, and Billy is my adopted son. Hope that clears things up!
