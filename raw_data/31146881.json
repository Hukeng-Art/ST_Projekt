  "summary": "<p>Izuku comes home a week after the sludge villain incident to find the apartment nearly empty, his mom gone, her stuff gone, and enough money to pay for a single month's rent. So, being the intelligent motherfucker he is, decides he's going to get his own place, open his own business, and fucking thrive. Oh, and Hawks is his mom now. So there's that.</p>",

  "text": "<p>Izuku sighs to himself as he tapes the large box of limited edition merch closed, and smacks the shipping label on it, he\u2019d kept some from his collection; Hawks, Eraserhead, Present Mic, Midnight, Miruko, Ingenium. He sold all his All Might merch, he just couldn\u2019t look at it the same way anymore, not after the roof top incident, realistic he said, it\u2019s okay to dream, but you have to think about what\u2019s real.</p>\n<p>Sighing to himself once more, he hefts the heavy box up, and carries it through the living room to the door, the post man was coming around in a little over an hour to pick it up.</p>\n<p>He looks around the sparsely furnished room, his mom had taken all her stuff and left, leaving him with enough money for the month\u2019s rent, and a note telling him how she just couldn\u2019t do it anymore.</p>\n<p>Shaking his head, he makes his way back to his room to continue packing his things in boxes, doing so in the silence of the apartment, his mom had stopped paying the phone bill, thus, he had no data, and there hadn\u2019t been any wifi since she disappeared that one day all those weeks ago.</p>\n<p>The knocking on the door pulls him out of his self-depreciating thoughts, exiting his room, he makes his way to the door, and pulls it open carelessly. \u201cHello.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHey kid,\u201d the post man, a short man, balding on top, spares him a small smile. \u201cPackage pick up?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUm, yea,\u201d the teen lifts the large box. \u201cHere you go, careful, it\u2019s heavy.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u2026</p>\n<p>Izuku, not Midoriya, he didn\u2019t want to be associated with that name, Izuku has a little over two thousand bucks to his name. He spends it wisely, he knows he needs a source of income, a steady source of income, so he thinks things through, possible job opportunities. People are always hiring for analysists, but then, he\u2019s only fourteen, so that\u2019s extremely unlikely. He could get a job at a caf\u00e9 or a store, but then, he\u2019d need a parental signature approving the minor\u2019s permit to work.</p>\n<p>Caf\u00e9.</p>\n<p>He could open a caf\u00e9.</p>\n<p>Make up some story to get the space and thrive from there.</p>\n<p>Nodding, he searches through his laptop, on his hotspot, from the mobile plan he\u2019d purchased for himself, searching for vacant properties. He comes across one, small, not overly so, but small enough that it was cozy, asking price was for six hundred and fifty bucks, he could make that work, if he was frugal about it.</p>\n<p>He calls the seller.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u2026</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Day one.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>His new caf\u00e9 is a dump.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s no other way to put it.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s a dump.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s trash everywhere, the lights don\u2019t work, the kitchens trashed, there\u2019s no lock on the door, the counter is rotting through, and that\u2019s just the ground level, the loft upstairs is even worse, no water, cracked pipes, no lights, wall paper peeling, window broken.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s a dump.</p>\n<p>But, he\u2019s not one to turn away from a challenge, his entire life is one big challenge, admittedly, those with his condition don\u2019t usually make it to his age, so that in itself is quite an accomplishment, one that is both disheartening and something to be proud of.</p>\n<p>Izuku leaves for the hardware store, where he checks the discount aisle, finds himself a sledge hammer, gloves, a protective suit, and safety goggles. He stops at the convenience store on his way back to get some hefty strong trash bags, extra-large, and sets to work up his return. Dawning his gear, he takes the first step in renovating his new caf\u00e9, by bashing a large hole into the rotting counter with his new sledge hammer named Bruiser.</p>\n<p>He tears out the counter and examines the booths to check for their ability to be salvaged, those, surprisingly, are in good condition, well made products usually are. The first thing he installs that night is a lock on the front door.</p>\n<p>The teen gets himself a broom, and starts cleaning out the trash, sweeping up the mess on the floor, peeling the wall paper off the walls, throwing away the old rotten cushions from the booths.</p>\n<p>At the end of his first day, he surveys the front room, clean, somewhat, not sanitized yet, and cleared of clutter, all the trash and other non-needed items in a pile where the counter used to be.</p>\n<p>He sleeps on the floor of his new caf\u00e9.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u2026</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Day Two. </strong>\n</p>\n<p>He wakes up bright and early the next morning, stretches, checks his phone and social media accounts, and sets off to work, starting with lugging the trash and junk out back to the dumpster.</p>\n<p>Izuku decides his mission for the day is to get the kitchen taken care of, so, the teen dawns his gear, and begins his work. Tearing off the tiles on the wall, cleaning up the trash littered around the room, tearing the rotten wood off the kitchen pass through between the back room and front room. He tears the pipes out and pulls the appliances out to check on the wiring behind them, like the booths themselves, the wiring connecting the appliances to the wall are intact and good.</p>\n<p>He lugs all the trash out to the main room before making another trip to the hardware store, where he purchases new tiles and new plumbing.</p>\n<p>Finding videos on YouTube, he manages to learn how to fix the plumbing himself and fix the sink.</p>\n<p>At the end of day two, his kitchen is in semi working order, and finds himself with running water.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u2026</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Day Three.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>He decides to dedicate the third day to the loft upstairs, which is a monster all on it\u2019s own, but he\u2019s up to the challenge, bring it the fuck on.</p>\n<p>The teen\u2019s first wise decision was to push the dumpster up under the upstairs window, making it so much easier to dispose of the garbage bags as they fill up with the garbage littering the loft. He breaks the entire window out with Bruiser, just smashes it, and watches it crash into the dumpster below. The floorboards are rotting, so he pulls them up, one by one, and throws those out the window too. The bathroom is fucking gross, but he soldiers on, tearing it apart, throwing it out the window, and sweeps the upstairs with his broom when everything\u2019s cleared away.</p>\n<p>With that done, he works to bring it together, returning to the hardware store, he buys lumber, sealant and stain, a tape measure, a handsaw, nails, and a hammer.</p>\n<p>In the front room of the downstairs, he saws the floor boards down to size, stains them, and carries them upstairs, one by one, to reconstruct the floor. By the time he\u2019s got the floor down, his arms are sore, so he takes a break, eating a small sandwich he\u2019d brought from the old apartment, and chugs a bottle of water, before setting off to work again.</p>\n<p>Another trip to the hardware store for a glass panel, measure out, he remakes the window, and screws a hook lock on for safety.</p>\n<p>He retiles the bathroom, regroups the rub, replaces the shower head, and redoes the plumbing.</p>\n<p>Izuku finds himself able to take a shower at his new place on day three.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u2026</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Day Four. </strong>\n</p>\n<p>The electric.</p>\n<p>That\u2019s a hard one.</p>\n<p>A few fixtures have to be rewired, he goes to YouTube for that, gets what he needs from the hardware store, and only electrocutes himself seventeen times.</p>\n<p>Surprise, bitches, he\u2019s not dead.</p>\n<p>He sets about furnishing the upstairs first, he gets himself a new bedframe, cheap, on sale at Ikea. A new mattress, a big one, so he can stretch out, he gets himself a new dresser, small, he doesn\u2019t have that many clothes to put inside of it, he hangs most of his clothes anyway. A desk, and a desk chair, a kitchen table and some chairs, he gets a fluffy rug because why not, and the necessary things for one to have in their bathroom.</p>\n<p>Izuku moves his things to his new home that afternoon in a series of trips and long walks that make his legs burn, but he\u2019s under the impression that the burning means its working, and his body will thank him for the work out later. He sets his merch up to rest on the shelves he installed, sets his lamp on the nightstand, unpacks his boxes of belongings, and takes a minute to survey his new place.</p>\n<p>He calls it an early night, considering the day as a job well done, and he\u2019s out by the time his head hits his new pillow.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u2026</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Day Five. </strong>\n</p>\n<p>On the fifth day, he does up the kitchen and the front room, he makes another trip to the hardware store for more wood, and rebuilds the counter, he electrocutes himself a total of four times as he rewires the display cases.</p>\n<p>He buys new cushions for the booths, paints the walls a soft neutral color, rewires the light fixtures with a total of eight shocks, and cleans the front windows.</p>\n<p>The teen retiles the kitchen and scrubs down the appliances.</p>\n<p>Izuku makes it nice and cozy, soft colors, rugs, couches along the back walls with pillows. Lamps and mini tables for the floor, if one didn\u2019t want to sit in a booth, and he gets the things one needs for a kitchen, especially a caf\u00e9 kitchen.</p>\n<p>Day five is the day he finishes his work, challenge completed, I\u2019m a bad bitch you can\u2019t kill me style, and he stands in the middle of his small caf\u00e9 with a triumphant smile.</p>\n<p>\n<em>Fuck you, Kacchan, I did accomplish something. </em>\n</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u2026</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, a cat caf\u00e9!\u201d Izuku tells himself as he eats a muffin, sitting on the edge of the counter, looking around at his masterpiece. \u201cI could do a cat caf\u00e9!\u201d He finishes his muffin and tosses the wrapper in the trashcan behind the counter. \u201cThat\u2019d be cool.\u201d</p>\n<p>He counts the money he has left, not a whole lot, but he owns the small building, so he doesn\u2019t have to worry about a rent payment or anything.</p>\n<p>Making a trip to Target, a few trips to Target, he gets what one would need to get in order to own a cat caf\u00e9, then he goes to a number of shelters, he wants to give them all a forever home, but he knows he can\u2019t, so he takes the ones that are often passed up.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u2026</p>\n<p>His little hole in the wall cat caf\u00e9 unironically named <em>\u2018Read The Catmosphere!\u2019</em> gathers a small crowd of people from all walks of life, mainly couples, teens, and the various sketchy looking guys who look like they may be a villain, but he has enough self-preservation not to say anything about it. He makes enough money to enroll himself into online high school courses.</p>\n<p>Surprisingly, his little caf\u00e9 becomes a popular hangout among the hero community, there he was, minding his own business, refilling the display case when Eraserhead and Present Mic come walking through his front door, he almost passed out, no joke, he literally almost did, but he refrained, took their orders, and internally fanboyed when he was given the impression that they liked his food.</p>\n<p>One of them must have shared their experience, because next thing he knows, all these people are showing up. Not that he\u2019s complaining, more people means more customers, and more customers means more money, and more money means more security.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u2026</p>\n<p>\u201cAnother day, another dollar.\u201d Izuku mutters to himself as he carries the trash out back to the dumpster behind his hole in the wall Caf\u00e9, lugging it behind him, it was heavy, he had to change out the kitty litter, and that shit was heavy as fuck. \u201cI\u2019m gonna have to replace the light socket in the front room.\u201d He loved the heroes who came to visit him in his caf\u00e9, but sometimes they could get a bit too zealous, and thus, he now had a broken light socket that needed replaced. \u201cCould be worse.\u201d</p>\n<p>Grunting under the weight of the trash bag, he swings it up into the dumpster, and jumps, shrieking in surprise, when he hears a soft groan. \u201cWhat the fuck\u2026.?\u201d Creeping around the length of the dumpster, he curls his fingers around the edge, and peers around, eyes widening at <em>who</em> lays there, unconscious to the world around him. \u201c\u2026.Hawks?......\u201d He garners no response from the man, not that he expects to, said man is completely dead to the world. \u201cI repeat my previous sentiment, what the fuck?\u201d</p>\n<p>Looking down one end of the alley, then down the other, he steps around the edge of the dumpster, and squats in front of the unconscious winged hero, reaching out tentatively to poke him in the cheek. \u201cYou okay?\u201d Izuku garners no response, once again, he wasn\u2019t expecting one. \u201cCome on man, not the part of town to be sleeping outdoors.\u201d The man\u2019s taller then him, bigger, he\u2019s a fucking midget, so he ends up dragging him across the alley and in through the back door of his caf\u00e9. He feels a tad bit bad about it, watching his wings drag limply over the dirty asphalt under him, his costume is probably getting all sorts of dirty too. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry man, you can have whatever off the menu for free for the next month, I\u2019ll pay for your dry cleaning too.\u201d</p>\n<p>Tugging him inside, he carefully sets the hero down to close and lock the back door, setting the alarm, Caf\u00e9\u2019s closed for the night, cats are fed, litter boxes are nice and fresh, he\u2019s set to retreat upstairs for the night. \u201cCome on man.\u201d Curling his arms under the hero\u2019s arms, around his chest, he lugs the man up the stairs to the apartment above. \u201cHow are you so thin but still so heavy, dude!\u201d He\u2019s panting by the time he gets the hero upstairs and takes a minute to catch his breath at the top of the stairs, before turning into his studio apartment. \u201cYou can have the bed, I guess, I\u2019ll take the couch.\u201d Izuku drags the man across the threshold, and grunts as he hefts him up, turning his head to avoid a wing to the face, and throws the unconscious hero up onto his bed as best as he can. Panting, he rubs his hands together, and moves around to the foot of the bed to remove the hero\u2019s shoes. \u201cOkay, uh, sleep tight, don\u2019t die, please for the love of god don\u2019t die.\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku eyes the unconscious hero for a minute longer before turning away, nodding to himself, he digs through his dresser for some clothes, spare clothes he\u2019d saved from his dad\u2019s things, and sets them on the nightstand next to the man, writes him a little note, where the bathroom is, etcetera.</p>\n<p>Rubbing at the back of his head, he smiles when Biscuit jumps up onto the bed with Nugget, and climbs up to sleep on the hero\u2019s chest, before turning to make his way to the bathroom to take a shower.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u2026</p>\n<p>Keigo is well aware of the warm rumbling weight on his chest when consciousness returns to him, and he groans, reaching up slowly to rub at his face with his hands, blinking his eyes open, he tilts his head when he finds himself staring up at the ceiling of a building, the inside of the ceiling of a building, and looks down to see what the weight on his chest is, eyebrows furrowing when he\u2019s met by the golden eyes of a honey colored cat bathing a kitten on his chest. \u201cHey\u2026.\u201d He lifts the tag on the cat\u2019s collar. \u201cBiscuit and,\u201d he lifts the tag on the kitten\u2019s collar. \u201cNugget.\u201d Petting their heads, he smiles when they purr louder. \u201cMind if I get up?\u201d</p>\n<p>Neither cat put up a fight when he slowly starts moving, migrating from his chest to the bed, to resume their grooming, and he pushes himself up slowly, eyes catching the stack of folded clothes and note on the nightstand, and reaches out for the slip of paper to skim over the words. \u201cHmmm.\u201d He hums, setting the note aside, he leans over for the stack of clothes, he doesn\u2019t recognize the room, but he does recognize the cats, he knows he\u2019s in the caf\u00e9, the little owner is around here somewhere. \u201cShower it is.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u2026</p>\n<p>Izuku tilts his head when he hears the water turn on, and breathes a sigh of relief, that means the hero\u2019s awake, i.e. not dead. Pulling his ladder up under the light fixture, he carefully climbs up with one hand, setting his tool bag on the top of the ladder, he carefully starts unscrewing the light fixture from the ceiling, and tosses it on the cushion of the booth next to him, and carefully begins taking apart the socket.</p>\n<p>It takes him a few minutes, working slow, wanting to get it done right the first time, though he\u2019s got it down, he still doesn\u2019t want to rush it and half ass the job and make a fire hazard waiting to happen.</p>\n<p>Fixing the wires in place, he yelps when he shocks himself and his muscles spasm, he falls backwards off his ladder and prepares to meet the floor. Again.</p>\n<p>\u201cWoah!\u201d Arms catch him before he makes impact with the floor. \u201cWhat the hell are you doing?\u201d</p>\n<p>Opening his eyes, he meets amused concerned gold, and he smiles. \u201cOh, hey, you\u2019re awake!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYea, hey,\u201d Hawks carefully sets him on his feet and nods up at the half complete socket. \u201cYou just electrocuted yourself, why not get an electrician?\u201d</p>\n<p>The teen wipes his hands on his the front of his shirt. \u201cWhy pay someone to do something you can do yourself?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUm, so you don\u2019t do <em>that</em>.\u201d The hero nods meaningfully at the socket, and the ladder, from which he\u2019d just fallen after electrocuting himself. \u201cYou know, you don\u2019t electrocute yourself to death.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, please,\u201d he waves a hand at his concerns dismissively. \u201cThat\u2019s nothing compared to the one when I first rewired the front room.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it.\u201d Izuku climbs back up his ladder. \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019m immortal, lady fate\u2019s been trying to kill me since I was four and hasn\u2019t succeeded yet.\u201d He looks down when he feels the stare, and meets the hero\u2019s gold eyes questioningly, tilting his head in confusion. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p>\n<p>Hawks shakes his head. \u201cI\u2019m not even going to <em>begin</em> unravelling that statement.\u201d He holds his gloves up in offering. \u201cAt least use these, they\u2019re shock proof.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, cool, thanks.\u201d The teen takes said offering happily, slipping the large gloves on his small hands, and gestures to the kitchen. \u201cHelp yourself.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYea,\u201d the hero shakes his head again and turns. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t mention it.\u201d Izuku turns his attention back to the socket, listening to the sound of a coffee machine coming to life behind him in the kitchen, and finished rewiring the socket, before replacing the light fixture. \u201cDone and done.\u201d Coming down from his ladder, he throws his tool bag on the closest table, and cracks his back. \u201cHeh, only electrocuted myself once this time.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>What</em> does that even <em>mean</em>?\u201d He turns to see the hero leaning over the counter with a cup of coffee in one hand. \u201c<em>Only</em> once?\u201d</p>\n<p>The greenette tosses the hero\u2019s gloves down on the counter, confiscates his coffee for a moment to take a large gulp, and passes the mug back. \u201cUm, that I only electrocuted myself once this time, what <em>else</em> would it mean?\u201d</p>\n<p>Hawks stares at him for a long time, but ultimately appears to decide against commenting further, and quickly changes the subject. \u201cThanks for bringing me in last night.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHey,\u201d he waves at him. \u201cI\u2019d only want someone to return the favor if they found me passed out in an alley.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy would <em>you</em> be passed out in an alley?\u201d</p>\n<p>He throws the man a finger gun. \u201cReasons.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to touch that.\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku nods. \u201cProbably for the best.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u2026</p>\n<p>Izuku\u2019s taking out the trash when he hears it, the soft mew of a small kitty cat in dire need of some help, and who\u2019s he to turn away a small kitty cat in dire need of some help, he took in a hero he found in the back alley who was in dire need of some help who has yet to leave, so it would be a tad bit hypocritical to turn away a small kitty cat in dire need of some help.</p>\n<p>Setting the large trash bag down, he searches the space. \u201cHello, kitty cat?\u201d Another soft mew, two soft mews, two little kitty cats. \u201cWhere you at, little kitty cats?\u201d</p>\n<p>Shuffling around the trashcans, he searches, water dripping down from his coat hood, the rain pouring over him in torrents.</p>\n<p>Moving the last one, he peers in behind the dumpster, and smiles. \u201cThere you are.\u201d The two little kittens mew at him and he cautiously reaches in for them. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, I\u2019m not gonna hurt you, wanna come in outta the rain?\u201d He holds his hand out, feeling two little wet noses brush against his fingertips. \u201cCan I pick you up?\u201d Carefully, he curls his fingers around the one and lifts it out, tucking it up in his coat, he reaches back out for the other one. \u201cCome on, little fluffballs, let\u2019s go inside.\u201d</p>\n<p>Forgoing the bag of trash in front of the dumpster, he makes his way back for the door, reaching out carefully for the door handle, he let\u2019s himself in. Kicking the door closed, he sets the alarm, kicks off his sneakers.</p>\n<p>Keigo\u2019s waiting upstairs when he makes his appearance, takes one look at him, and plants his hands on his hips. \u201cHow many?\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku smiles sheepishly. \u201cUmm\u2026.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNestling,\u201d the hero gives him <em>that</em> look. \u201cHow many?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell\u2026.\u201d He carefully pulls the kittens out from inside his coat. \u201cTwo.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cKiddo,\u201d the man eyes the poor wet kitty cats. \u201cYou just brought a new one in two days ago.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAw, but Kei, look at\u2019em!\u201d The teen holds the two pitiful kittens up for the hero to see. \u201cThey\u2019re so sad!\u201d</p>\n<p>The hero heaves a sigh. \u201cOkay, okay, stop making that little puppy pouty face.\u201d He rolls his eyes fondly. \u201cI\u2019ll go get a towel, <em>you</em>, get out of those clothes and into something warm.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay, <em>dad</em>.\u201d The teen snarks, laughing lightly when the hero tugs on his ear playfully as he passes him, a playful warning, all in good fun. \u201cCome on, little kitties.\u201d Walking over to the cat bed on top of the dresser, he sets his two new family members down, and pets their heads with a finger. \u201cWe\u2019ll get you all dry and warm.\u201d</p>\n<p>He\u2019s just pulling his sweatshirt on when Keigo returns, he\u2019d given him a few minutes to change in privacy, \u2018watching\u2019 with his feathers to know when he was finished. \u201cOkay, you,\u201d he points at himself when the man points at him and the hero nods. \u201cGet under those blankets before you catch a cold. I\u2019ll dry off and tuck in the little kitties.\u201d</p>\n<p>Giggling under his breath, he nods, padding over to his big bed, and climbs in on the left, Keigo\u2019s side was the right. He watches the big bad number three hero gently rub the two fluffy kittens dry, tuck a small blanket around them, and set a small bowl of food and water next to them, before tossing the towel over the heater to dry, and making his way into his side of the bed.</p>\n<p>\u201cGet in here, hatchling.\u201d Izuku scoots in close when the hero holds his arms open to him, cuddling into his chest, sighing contentedly when arms curl around him. \u201cGetcha all warmed up, you should know better then to stay out in the rain this time of year.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay <em>mom</em>, I was wearing my coat.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHey!\u201d The kid laughs at the indignation in the hero\u2019s voice. \u201cI am not <em>\u2018mom\u2019</em>!\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku nods into the hero\u2019s chest. \u201cYea, I know. I\u2019ll be fine, papa bird, don\u2019t worry about it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYea, you say that now, just you wait until you\u2019re walking around here sniffling everywhere you go.\u201d He pulls the blankets up over the youth just a bit more. \u201cYou\u2019re gonna be coughing and hacking up lungs, sick as a dog.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCalm down, <em>mama</em> bird.\u201d The teen smiles when a wing folds over them. \u201cSo, Kei, not that I\u2019m complaining, but it\u2019s been like a month and a half since I dragged your unconscious as\u2014<em>butt</em> in from the alley and you haven\u2019t left yet, do you just live here now or something?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku smiles, a real smile, not that his other smiles aren\u2019t real, but this smile is different then the other smiles, and nods in closer. \u201cCool.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u2026</p>\n<p>\u201cWe should buy the place next door.\u201d That, is not something Izuku is expecting to hear at nine thirty in the morning, and he swears loudly when he drops the pot of freshly brewed coffee. \u201cWoah, hey, fledgling, be careful!\u201d He\u2019s eternally grateful for Keigo when feathers catch the pot before it can hit the floor and shatter.</p>\n<p>He looks up at him incredulously. <em>\u201cWhat!\u201d</em></p>\n<p>Keigo smirks at him, because though he was concerned about possibly burns, he still found it amusing, like the asshole he is. \u201cI said, we should buy the place next door, your little caf\u00e9 is starting to become a tad on the popular side, maybe we should expand.\u201d</p>\n<p>Shaking himself out, he steps forward, picking up the coffee pot, he steps around the man to return to the front room, pouring Eraserhead (Aizawa\u2014as he\u2019s been told to call him) his fresh large cup of coffee, receiving a grunt of appreciation from the man as he turns to collapse on one of the couches in the back to be cat piled on while enjoying his god juice. \u201cKei, that\u2019s a lot of work, it took me a week to get this side this way, and I\u2019m <em>still</em> working on it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYea,\u201d the hero curls around him from behind. \u201cBut this time you wouldn\u2019t be doing it on your own, think about it, tear down the separating wall, expand the floor, <em>we could get more cats</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>He turns his head to look up at his new roommate with narrowed eyes. \u201cAre you bribing me with cats?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt depends.\u201d Keigo smiles down at him. \u201cIs it working?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p>\n<p>It worked.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u2026</p>\n<p>Izuku knew his good week was going to well, he knew something was going to come, it was going to come to a head, he knew it. People like him can\u2019t have nice things, quirkless Deku\u2019s don\u2019t get to have nice things, as soon as they find something they like, someone finds a way to take it from them, it\u2019s just how things worked.</p>\n<p>He drops his bags, groceries, cat supplies, refills for the sweeteners and creamers, when he comes to find his caf\u00e9 in shambles. Burnt out on the inside, the glass windows broken, the booths and couches charred and singed, the counter still smoldering, and he drops his things, darting inside, his mind still reeling that his livelihood is <em>gone</em>, calling for his kitties, his babies, his best friends (outside of Keigo). Darting up the back steps, two at a time, he\u2019s relieved to find the upstairs apartment virtually untouched, his little feline friends all hiding scattered through the room.</p>\n<p>Upon completing a head count and finding everyone present, he returns to the downstairs to take stock of the damage, searching through news feeds for what happened, why his caf\u00e9 was in this state.</p>\n<p>Endeavor.</p>\n<p>He should have known.</p>\n<p>Izuku feels tears burn in his eyes as he slowly looks around his burnt cusp of a caf\u00e9, all his hard work, blood, sweat, and tears, all down the drain.</p>\n<p>He falls to his knees, tears finally streaming down his face, staring at the remnants of his caf\u00e9.</p>\n<p>Time passes by, he doesn\u2019t even realize it, he just sits there in devastation, staring at the tatters and remnants of his world shattered around him. \u201cFledgling!\u201d He hears something hit the ground outside, boots stomping the pavement, the sound of glass cracking underneath. \u201cFledgling, are you oka\u2014\u201d The words cut off immediately, interrupted by a deep inhale, glass crackles underneath him as the hero enters their caf\u00e9. \u201cFledgling, it\u2019ll be okay.\u201d Hands curl around his arms from behind and he just sits there, staring at his ruined caf\u00e9, silent tears streaming down his face. \u201cIt\u2019ll be okay, little fledgling, it will.\u201d</p>\n<p>Slowly, the teen turns his head, broken green meeting sorrowful gold, and he voice cracks when he finds it. \u201cK\u2014Kei\u2026M\u2014My caf\u00e9\u2026..\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI know, lil bird.\u201d Keigo nods lightly. \u201cI know, are the cats okay?\u201d</p>\n<p>He nods numbly, looking back to his ruined home. \u201cT\u2014They\u2019re upstairs.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGood, that\u2019s good, at least our kitties are okay.\u201d Fingers curl under his arms and he\u2019s lifted to his feet. \u201cCome on, hatchling, let\u2019s go pack a bag, we\u2019ll go stay at a hotel until we can get things sorted out.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cM\u2014My caf\u00e9\u2026..\u201d Izuku can\u2019t tear his eyes away. \u201cP\u2014Papa bird\u2026.My c\u2014caf\u00e9\u2026.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI know, baby bird, I know.\u201d He guides the teen around gently. \u201cCome on, it\u2019s gonna be okay, I promise, we\u2019ll get it all fixed up again, just like before.\u201d The teen nods numbly, letting himself be guided up the stairs, he watches numbly as Keigo packs a bag for him, as an arm is curled around his waist and he\u2019s guided back around, back down the back stares, and out the front door, what was supposed to be the front door. He says nothing, simply exists, when he\u2019s scooped up off his feet.</p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t pay attention enough to see where it is exactly that they fly, he\u2019s in a daze, his mind trying to wrap itself around the fact that his small caf\u00e9 is in ruins, his home, everything he\u2019d worked for is gone. He doesn\u2019t hear the conversation that transpires as his hero converses with the woman at the desk, as they\u2019re handed a key, and off they go to their room.</p>\n<p>Izuku curls up when he\u2019s set down on their hotel room bed, feeling the man carefully pull his sneakers off and tuck the blankets up around him, the edge of the bed dips as he sits down next to him, combing his fingers through his curls gently. \u201cIt\u2019ll be okay, nestling, I promise.\u201d</p>\n<p>He finally speaks his first words as he turns to look up at his closest companion. \u201cPromise, Kei?\u201d</p>\n<p>The hero nods, rubbing his cheek lightly with his knuckle. \u201cI swear.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what I\u2019d do without you, Kei.\u201d He rubs a hand over his face. \u201cI\u2019d probably have killed myself.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHey now, don\u2019t talk like that.\u201d Keigo pets his bangs back. \u201cYou do have me, that options not even on the table, we\u2019ll get our caf\u00e9 fixed up in no time.\u201d</p>\n<p>He rubs at his nose. \u201cAt least the cats are okay.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSee, there is some positivity in this.\u201d The man pinches his nose playfully. \u201cOur kitties are just fine, a little startled, but otherwise untouched.\u201d</p>\n<p>The teen tugs on the front of the hero\u2019s shirt until he\u2019s forced around, and just flops down on top of him, and the greenette curls his arms around the man\u2019s shoulders, the weight of him resting his head on his chest playing the role of an anchor to keep him from losing his shit at what\u2019s been done to his pride and joy of an establishment.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u2026</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay, you have to the count of three to stop being a Pouty Polly before I stop it myself.\u201d Izuku was not happy that the hero was using his money to fix up his caf\u00e9, he\u2019d lived under the impression, for the last year, of <em>\u2018why pay someone to do something you can do yourself\u2019</em> and he was not happy that this was happening and had every intention to make sure his partner in crime knew this, hence the silent treatment he\u2019d been giving him since breakfast when he\u2019d first told him. \u201cFledgling, I\u2019m not kidding, stop giving me the silent treatment.\u201d</p>\n<p>It didn\u2019t matter to him that as the number three hero, Keigo had more than enough to fund the rehabilitation of their caf\u00e9, he didn\u2019t want to owe him, and it didn\u2019t matter to him that the man swore that he wouldn\u2019t, because under the <em>\u2018I owe you\u2019</em> laws of the universe, he <em>would</em> owe him one no matter how much he denied he did.</p>\n<p>\u201cOne.\u201d</p>\n<p>He turns to glower at the older taller male.</p>\n<p>\u201cTwo.\u201d</p>\n<p>His glare speaks volumes.</p>\n<p>\u201cThree.\u201d</p>\n<p>He shrieks when he\u2019s swept up off his feet.</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay mister, I can see we need to have a visit with our favorite <em>best friend</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>That breaks his silent treatment, and he starts squirming, because he knows who that statement is in reference to, and when Keigo got like that, it was brutal. \u201cNo! Wait! I\u2019ll stop! Please no! I\u2019ll stop! I promise!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, no, you had your chance.\u201d The blonde man carries him across their hotel room. \u201cIt\u2019s too late, they\u2019ve already put you into their schedule, there\u2019s not stopping them now.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cKei, please! No more silent treatment! I swear!\u201d He\u2019s a desperate man when they come to stand at the foot of their bed, bracing his hands around the man\u2019s shoulders, he shakes his head frantically, no, not a visit from that supposed <em>best friend</em>. \u201cNo more! I promise! No more silent treatment! No more Pouty Polly! I swear! Not them! Please!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, but, my beloved little nestling.\u201d Keigo smiles up at him and he decides he decidedly does not like that smile, not at all. \u201cThey\u2019ve already arrived.\u201d The teen shrieks as he\u2019s tossed back, bursting into giggles with the hero seemingly looms over him before flopping down over him, and he shakes his head, giggling frantically when fingers slowly walk up his sides towards his ribs, slow and teasing, the man\u2019s such an asshole like that. \u201cThey take special care of Pouty Polly\u2019s who give their bestest friend in the whole wide world the silent treatment.\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku tries to catch his hands before the reach their final destination. \u201cKehehei!

Those fingers dig in slightly, he\u2019s such a tease, it\u2019s what makes him such an asshole when it comes to these things, and the greenette shrieks softly, throwing his arms down. \u201cI love it when you shriek like that, you sound like a mouse, let\u2019s hear it again, shall we?\u201d He shakes his head, but those fingers dig in again, and he shrieks softly once more. \u201cIt\u2019s adorable. You\u2019re adorable and I feel so blessed to have gotten to know you like I have. Truly,\u201d they dig in again and he shrieks once again. \u201cI do. Having a little baby bird in my life gave me something I didn\u2019t know I needed, I was missing out on, until I finally had it.\u201d</p>\n<p>The teen giggles brightly when those evil fingers knead in lightly. \u201cYour such a softie!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPfff! Yea, I am, but only when it comes to you, Eyas.\u201d The man grins. \u201cGuess what happens next.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUmm,\u201d Izuku curls his arms around himself. \u201cYou let me go?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNow, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s what happens next.\u201d He shakes his head. \u201cI think our best friend digs their claws in, or should I say, they dig their <em>talons</em> in.\u201d Those fingers poised over his ribs claw in harshly, and he arches his back, squealing brightly, curling his arms around himself tighter. \u201cOh yea, that\u2019s the good stuff, let me hear it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku shrieks with laughter, trying to rock from side to side, no easy task with a man who weighs double his weight laying over him, his fingers clawing into one of his worst spots. \u201cKehehehehei!

I like having this in my life. It\u2019s so sweet and adorable. A little hatchling\u2019s laughter.

The teen tries to cover his exposed side, but large hands catch his, and in retaliation, the man takes a deep breath and blows a massive raspberry, and he squeals loud and proud, struggling to free his hands when he takes another deep breath and blows another massive raspberry into his side.</p>\n<p>\u201cKEHEHEHEHEIIII STOHOHOHOHOP!

KEEHEHEHHEHEEIII NOHOHOHOHOHOHO!\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u2026</p>\n<p>Keigo meets with the repair technicians downstairs while he heads upstairs to take care of the cats, he doesn\u2019t want to spend more than a minute in the burnt out shell of his beloved cat caf\u00e9 floor then he has to, so he\u2019ll spend his time upstairs in their otherwise undamaged apartment with the cats, while the hero goes over the floor plans with the restoration technicians.</p>\n<p>He wants his caf\u00e9 to look exactly like it did before the fire, maybe minor changes, but basically the same set up.</p>\n<p>Keigo knows what he wants, and he trusts the man to make sure the workers get the job done right, it helped that he was the number three hero, and no one really wanted to let him down in half-assing the job or doing it outside of what he wants as the finished project.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u2026</p>\n<p>It takes two months for their caf\u00e9 to be completely restored, Keigo is so cheesy, he blindfolds him, saying he wants it to be a surprise, even though they changed very, very few things from the original layout, but he goes along with it, if only to make the man child happy.</p>\n<p>\u201cCan I look now?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNot yet!\u201d</p>\n<p>Heaving a sigh, he nods, trusting the winged hero not to let him run into anything.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s the ringing of a bell, the sound of shuffling feet, and then there\u2019s tension on the blind fold. \u201cOkay, ready?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI was born ready.\u201d</p>\n<p>Keigo snorts at his sass, but undoes the blindfold all the same, and he\u2019s met with a full caf\u00e9, just the way it was before the fire.</p>\n<p>He fucking <em>sobs</em>.</p>\n<p>Keigo freaks out thinking he did something wrong.</p>\n<p>Miruko and Midnight laugh at them.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u2026</p>\n<p>\u201cIzuku Midoriya-Takami.\u201d It wasn\u2019t officially his last name, but Keigo started adding his own surname on his full name, and the teen couldn\u2019t find it in himself to tell him to stop, it made him feel all warm and fuzzy on the inside. \u201cWhen did taking the trash out turn into an hour adventure?\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku smiles sheepishly. \u201cWell, you see\u2014\u201d he\u2019s cut off by a soft mew from within his overly large hoodie\u2019s pocket.</p>\n<p>Keigo narrows his eyes, if his hands hadn\u2019t already found their way to his hips, like the <em>mama</em> bird he is, they\u2019d most certainly be there now. \u201cWhatcha got in there, young nestling?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNothin.\u201d He carefully pulls his right hand out of his hoodie pocket. \u201cMy hand.\u201d He replaces that hand and pulls the other out. \u201cMy other hand.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUhuh.\u201d The man nods lightly. \u201cHow\u2019s about you keep those hands where I can see them.\u201d</p>\n<p>Swallowing thickly, the greenette pulls both hands out of his hoodie pocket, pointedly ignoring the softly mewing bulge in said hoodie pocket. \u201cSee, nothin\u2019.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI repeat, <em>uhuh</em>.\u201d The hero points at the noticeably moving bulge. \u201cWhat\u2019s that there?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUmm\u2026..Nothin\u2019?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNothin\u2019 huh?\u201d Keigo crosses his arms, and they find themselves in a stare down. \u201cTell me the truth, fledgling.\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku licks his lips. \u201cHis name is Boo.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIzuku. Midoriya. Takami. Do not tell me you have a kitty cat in that pocket.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay.\u201d The hero narrows his gold eyes and the teen smiles slightly. \u201cI won\u2019t tell you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re more trouble then you\u2019re worth.\u201d The man points at the window. \u201cIt\u2019s snowing, you naughty little hatchling, you were out in the snowy weather for an hour in nothing but a pair of sweats and a hoodie, you\u2019re gonna get yourself sick.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMoooom.\u201d He whines as he pulls the fluffy black kitten out of his pocket. \u201cBut Booooo! He was so scared, he wouldn\u2019t come out from under the dumpster, and he looked so cold, I couldn\u2019t just leave him out there.\u201d Izuku\u2019s eyes widen when he involuntarily sniffles. \u201cWait!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWas that a <em>sniffle</em>?\u201d Keigo points at him. \u201cDid you just <em>sniffle</em>?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo! No I did not!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou did too!\u201d The winged hero steps forward to carefully snatch the kitten up out of the boy\u2019s hands. \u201cOkay, young fledgling, you get yourself all bundled up, I\u2019m talking socks, flannel PJ\u2019s, the works, and under those blankets.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt was <em>just</em> a sniffle!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t talk back to your mama bird, hatchling! You do as your told!\u201d</p>\n<p>The teenager throws his hands up. \u201cIt was <em>just</em> a sniffle!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUhuh,\u201d the man stares at him, then at the dresser, then back at him, then at the bed, and right back at him. \u201cAnd that sniffles gonna turn into a stuffy nose, and that stuffy nose is gonna be joined by a sore throat, and that sore throat\u2019s gonna invite a stomach ache, and that stomach ache is gonna call over a cough, and that cough is going to tell that sore throat to make itself at home.\u201d He cradles the chubby little kitten in one hand and points at the bed. \u201cMarch, eyas.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMooom!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHatchling, if you think this mama bird won\u2019t change you himself if you don\u2019t get your little self movin\u2019, you got another thing comin\u2019.\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku points at the dresser and bed over his shoulder. \u201cI\u2019m gonna go change and get in bed.\u201d</p>\n<p>Keigo pats his head as he walks passed him for the towel draped over the heater. \u201cGood nestling.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u2026</p>\n<p>Izuku knows the part of Musutufa his Cat Caf\u00e9 is located isn\u2019t the best part of Musutufa, crime rates pretty high, even with more heroes seemingly patrolling the area, these people in these here parts are crafty sons a bitches, they know how to work around the playing field.</p>\n<p>Now, the teen doesn\u2019t want an alarm system, he doesn\u2019t think he needs one, thus far his small caf\u00e9 has been untouched. He serves to all kinds of members of society, other kids, runaways, police, villains, heroes, criminals (not villains because there is a difference), and he\u2019s made his small caf\u00e9 a neutral territory, no fighting and no arrests, once you\u2019re outside those doors though, man eat man world, too bad, so sad.</p>\n<p>Most people in the area knows that the Cat Caf\u00e9 owned by the badass (everyone else would say adorable) green haired kid is protected by the villain community just as much as it was protected by the hero community, because he treated them (specifically the villains) like they were people and not just what they\u2019d done.</p>\n<p><em>\u2018Read The Catmosphere\u2019</em> is off limits, no criminal or villainous activity is permitted within the establishment, no heroics was permitted within the establishment, it was neutral territory for all sides involved, the one place where villains and heroes alike could come together and hold conversation like normal human beings.</p>\n<p>Now, as it was said, Izuku doesn\u2019t want a security alarm, he\u2019s more than capable of protecting his cat caf\u00e9 from anyone who came with the intent of causing some sort of damage, whether it be physical or financial.</p>\n<p>He has a baseball bat, it\u2019s name is Bowser, and it\u2019s his second best friend.</p>\n<p>Keigo\u2019s his first best friend.</p>\n<p>Though he\u2019s still deciding on whether or not he counts given the fact that he\u2019s more of a parental figure then a friend.</p>\n<p>But he digresses.</p>\n<p>The teen looks up from brewing fresh pots of coffee when the doors to his fine feline caffeine establishment slam open, and a man he <em>doesn\u2019t</em> recognize flies inside, his eyes narrow at the smoke rolling off his form, the burns littering his skin.</p>\n<p>In the back of the caf\u00e9, Eraserhead stands from his reclining position on one of the couches, much to the annoyance of the cats using him as their personal resting spot. Across from him, Midnight and Present Mic rise in turn, Miruko pushes the chair she\u2019s seated in back, leaving her pastry on the plate on the table as she stands.</p>\n<p>Along the far wall, a group of individuals stand, a pale skinned blue haired man, whom he\u2019s been told to call Tomura (he calls him Tomu and hasn\u2019t been told to stop), a dark haired man stands next to him, blue fire climbing up his arms, he knows him under the moniker of Dabi (Izuku\u2019s no dumbass and he knows he\u2019s Todoroki Touya but he\u2019s also no bitch and won\u2019t say anything unless the man says anything first), and a blonde girl, a few years older then him, hair done up in two messy buns on top of her head, red eyes staring longingly and fiercely at the two bit newb who\u2019s just crashed into everyone\u2019s caf\u00e9.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou okay, man?\u201d Izuku turns away from the coffee machines and leans over the counter. \u201cLook a little roughed up.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHelp me! Please! I didn\u2019t do anything! It was baby formula! I lost my job and my wife, and my daughter was hungry!\u201d</p>\n<p>The man looks around wildly, pleading for anyone to assist him in escaping his pursuer, Izuku turns his head when he sees orange, and his expression darkens.</p>\n<p>Bitch, not again.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey,\u201d he leans over, reaching under the counter for Bowser, and addresses the criminal at the same time, the man\u2019s wild terrified eyes meet his, and he nods at his side. \u201cCome stand back here man, when I tell you to give me the fire extinguisher under the counter, toss it over, got it?\u201d</p>\n<p>The man nods faintly, confusion overtakes his features, but decides against questioning it, darting around the counter as the teen climbs up to stand on it, positioning himself just right, he feels the tension in the room rise as the orange flaming blur grows closer and closer, the villains preparing to flee, he sees a manic light fill Dabi\u2019s eyes, but glares him into staying put, and the heroes preparing to run damage control.</p>\n<p>Izuku pulls his arms back, fingers curled around the handle of his baseball bat, and waits until the doors are thrown open again before swinging.</p>\n<p>A resounding crack echoes loudly through the caf\u00e9, and the flaming hero: Endeavor goes <em>down</em>, landing flat on his back with a loud thud, and lays there unmoving as blood slowly trickles down from a gash gracing his temple.</p>\n<p>The teen sets his bat down and turns to the man behind the counter. \u201cFire extinguisher.\u201d Said man tosses him the fire extinguisher, and the teen turns back to the flaming hero, spraying him down, leaving an unconscious number two hero with a dent in his temple covered in white extinguishing fluid laying on the floor in front of the doors to his fine cat and coffee serving establishment. \u201cBitch, I don\u2019t fucking think so.\u201d</p>\n<p>He hops down from the counter, and finally takes notice of the silence in the room, looking up to see all eyes focused on him containing various amounts of amusement and awe. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cKid.\u201d Dabi whistles lowly. \u201cYou\u2019re my fucking hero, I swear to fucking god, good show, <em>good</em> show.\u201d</p>\n<p>Himi cheers softly. \u201cIzu, that was beautiful!\u201d</p>\n<p>Eraserhead collapses back onto his couch and his cat companions return to their previous spots. \u201cNice swing, problem child.\u201d</p>\n<p>He gets various compliments from his patrons, and he bows, like the little shit he is, Keigo\u2019s gonna be pissed that he put himself in harm\u2019s way (Oh god, he\u2019s gonna eat my side for-fucking-ever!), but that\u2019s a problem for future Izuku to deal with, and he turns to the man behind his counter. \u201cWhat\u2019s your name, sir?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cK\u2014Kioshi Yamashita.\u201d</p>\n<p>The man, Yamashita, seems to be in shock.</p>\n<p>Izuku slowly crosses around behind his counter. \u201cCome on, Yamashita, I\u2019ll help bandage you up.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u2026</p>\n<p>\u201cHey, uh, I saw the sign in the window.\u201d Izuku looks up from cleaning the expresso machine at the voice, and raises an eyebrow, purple gravity defying hair, Gucci eyebags, he looks like death warmed over, like, as hot as the sun, he feels an instant connection (not that he would know, Keigo curls around him when they get in bed, the man\u2019s such an octopus, not that he\u2019s complaining, he sleeps like a baby in the octopus\u2019s embrace). \u201cWas wondering if the position was still open.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUh, yea,\u201d he sets his dish towel down. \u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShinsou.\u201d The \u2018dead to the world\u2019 teen introduces himself. \u201cShinsou Hitoshi.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, sup, Shinsou, I\u2019m Takami-Midoriya Izuku, you can call me whatever you\u2019re comfortable with.\u201d He leans forward against the counter. \u201cYou\u2019re interested in the part time position we have?\u201d</p>\n<p>Shinsou nods slightly. \u201cYea.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCool,\u201d Izuku nods. \u201cI\u2019ll have to ask my partner first; we make decisions together.\u201d They really don\u2019t, well, Keigo doesn\u2019t, when he wants to do something, he usually just tortures him until he agrees to go along with whatever he wants to do. Keigo\u2019s an asshole. But he loves him that way. He turns his head slightly. \u201cHey! Mom!\u201d</p>\n<p>In all honesty, Shinsou is expecting an older woman to come out from the kitchen, he does not expect, however, for the one called \u2018mom\u2019 to be the number three pro hero, the winged hero: Hawks.</p>\n<p>\u201cYea,\u201d the man looks between the two teens, a dish towel hanging over his shoulder, feathery blonde hair pulled back in a small bun. \u201cWhat\u2019s up, who\u2019s this?\u201d</p>\n<p>Shinsou stares, because the green haired boy just called out to his <em>mom</em>, and it was <em>Hawks</em> who answered.</p>\n<p>Izuku gestures at the purple haired teen. \u201cHe\u2019s asking about the job offering.\u201d</p>\n<p>The hero nods. \u201cAh, cool,\u201d the purple haired teen blinks in surprise when those gold eyes focus solely on him. \u201cGot any experience?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Shinsou announces. \u201cBut, I\u2019ve been making and drinking coffee since I turned four and I know the good shit when I see it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCool.\u201d Hawks tosses the dish towel at him. \u201cYou\u2019re hired, finish drying the dishes in the back.\u201d</p>\n<p>He blinks in surprise, but catches the towel, and nods, stepping around the counter for the kitchen. He pretends not to hear Izuku ask Hawks if he\u2019s Eraserhead\u2019s secret love child, because fucking god, he wishes he were.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u2026</p>\n<p>Shinsou stares down at the body laying in front of the pastry case with raised eyebrows, before turning to his boss, perched on the counter, baseball bat, whom he\u2019s been told is named Bowser, laying across his lap, the other teen\u2019s face buried in his hands. \u201cUm\u2026..\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cKeigo,\u201d Izuku slowly lowers his hands. \u201cIs going to be <em>so</em> pissed.\u201d</p>\n<p>The brainwasher stares at him, still a tad overwhelmed from the fact that the other boy calls the number three hero by his first name, that <em>he</em> was told to call the aforementioned hero by his first name. \u201cI\u2019ll totally help you hide the body, no questions asked, all I ask is free expresso shots, no cap, for a month.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDeal.\u201d The greenette carefully sets Bowser aside. \u201cIs he even dead?\u201d</p>\n<p>Shrugging, the taller teen squats and presses his fingers to the man\u2019s neck, searching for a pulse. \u201cNah, there\u2019s a pulse.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, thank god!\u201d Izuku hops down off the counter. \u201cIf I killed him, Keigo would\u2019ve seared my ass off, not pleasant.\u201d He rubs his hands together and looks up at the taller teen when he straightens. \u201cHelp me lug his ass to the alley out back, we gotta get rid of the evidence before Keigo gets back, or I\u2019m not gonna be sitting for at least a month.\u201d</p>\n<p>Shinsou nods sagely. \u201cYea, you get his feet, we\u2019ll carry him out back and stash him behind the dumpster.\u201d</p>\n<p>The greenette nods in turn and looks around him to the two bit not-so-villainous wannabe villains staring at them from a table a few tables away. \u201cWe got witnesses.\u201d</p>\n<p>Shinsou nods. \u201cBody first, witnesses second, lock the door so they can\u2019t escape.\u201d</p>\n<p>A nice friend will help you move, a good friend will hire you a lawyer, a great friend will help you hide the body, but a REAL friend will help you get rid of the witnesses.</p>"
