Timeline-wise it falls after season 1 of Daredevil and in the middle-ish of season 1 of Lucifer. </p>\n<p>Fic title is from 'Bloodstream' by Ed Sheeran; which, in my opinion, is an excellent song for Matt.</p>\n<p class=\"jump\">(See the end of the work for <a href=\"#work_endnotes\">more notes</a>.)</p>\n<p>If you enjoy my writing, consider checking out my original fantasy novel, available <a href=\"https://books2read.com/u/mKpED5\" rel=\"nofollow\">here!</a></p>",

And I didn\u2019t hear about it until he was 13 and had been stuck in this orphanage-nunnery horror straight out of a Dickens novel for two years. I adopted him and took him back to California. He lived with me for five years, until he started university and came back to New York. He still visits for major holidays and the like.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Chloe stared at him; he could practically see the wheels spinning in her brain. \u201cThen why do children freak you out so much?\u201d she finally blurted and he nearly laughed at the absurdity of it all.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cMatthew was a perfect student and a paragon of virtue, and I still wanted to throw him off a very tall building some days. Children are terrible.

And taking him in like that? That was a good thing to do. The right thing to do.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Lucifer bristled, \u201cI\u2019m the prince of darkness, I never do the \u2018right\u2019 thing or the \u2018good\u2019 thing.

Wouldn\u2019t want undue angelic attention.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Chloe rolled her eyes, \u201cAngelic attention.

It had fallen open when it tumbled out of the devil\u2019s pocket and exposed was a line of gleaming platinum credit cards, a driver\u2019s license\u2026and a photo. An old one. The detective squinted at it, surprised and curious. A woman, dark-haired, with a dangerous smile (the detective recognized her, the bartender at Lux), a man, dark-haired, with wicked eyes (the detective\u2019s wayward, unasked-for partner), a boy, dark-haired, with a clever, sharp face (the detective didn\u2019t know who he could be). </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cAh, thank you for holding onto that, Detective,\u201d and just like that, the wallet disappeared from her hands, vanishing back into a suit more expensive than her car. </em>\n</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\n<em>\u2026</em>\n</p>\n<p>NOW</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cMatt\u2019s the kid in the photo, isn\u2019t he?
