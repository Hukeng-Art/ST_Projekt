  "summary": "<p>\u201cSo let me get this straight,\u201d Arthur said, folding his fingers together as the man in front him awkwardly shifted. \u201cYou are under the impression if you win the favor of my servant that you will then win my favor?\u201d He asked and the nobleman shifted again. </p>\n<p>\u201cWell, sire.\u201d He said \u201cThat is the common consensus among\u2026 The chatter.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe chatter.\u201d Arthur repeated and his mind flashed to all the kindness Merlin had received from other nobles. Dear God. </p>\n<p>Or</p>\n<p>Merlin has all of Camelot (and neighboring kingdoms) wrapped around his finger and Arthur is beginning to resign himself to the fact his servant somehow has more power than he does.</p>",

  "text": "<p>\u201cLord Ponte is a git.\u201d Merlin announced as he stomped into Arthur\u2019s room, causing the usual ruckus as he banged door open and dropped Arthur\u2019s newly polished boots onto the floor. The king glanced up at him from his desk, but didn\u2019t bother to reprimand the treasonous words. He had heard it enough times that he was almost immune to it.</p>\n<p>\u201cDid you finish with my armor?\u201d He asked instead, dipping his quill into a pot of ink to sign yet another form. From across the room, Merlin huffed.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, no thanks to your lovely <em>visitor</em>.\u201d He grumbled. Arthur wondered if he should humor him by asking what Lord Ponte did, but his servant didn\u2019t seem to need to be asked as he launched into a tirade. Apparently the visiting noble had tried to enlist Merlin\u2019s help in seducing another visiting Lady. Why anyone would think <em>Merlin</em> was a good wingman was beyond Arthur, but nevertheless Merlin seemed to have vehemently opposed the situation anyways.</p>\n<p>\u201cI hope you choose somebody else to give the title to.\u201d Merlin finally mumbled \u201cPonte is just going to use it to try and crawl his way onto women.\u201d He wrinkled his nose and closed Arthur\u2019s curtains. The king hummed absently, trying to focus more on the task in front of him than Merlin\u2019s words.</p>\n<p>\u201cThere isn\u2019t anyone else qualified.\u201d He commented \u201cBut I will talk to him about he treats those in my household.\u201d He added as an appeasement. Merlin didn\u2019t look appeased.</p>\n<p>\u201cLady Ponte is more than qualified.\u201d He pointed out and Arthur paused.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Lady</em> Ponte?\u201d He repeated with some curiosity. He hadn\u2019t seen much of Lord Ponte\u2019s wife, but knew Merlin had spent time helping her around the castle. She was a warm, sweet lady who Arthur was fairly certain would also cut your throat if offended. It might have been Merlin\u2019s fondness of her that led to his annoyance towards Lord Ponte.</p>\n<p>\u201cShe runs most of her husband\u2019s affairs anyways,\u201d Merlin shrugged, fluffing some pillows \u201cThis one would simply be in her name. She more than deserves it with putting up with her gross husband.\u201d He added. Arthur put down his quill, considering. He hadn\u2019t really contemplated a woman to be burdened with this responsibility\u2026 But he didn\u2019t see what the issue would be.</p>\n<p>\u201cAlright,\u201d He finally said after weighing the pros and cons in his head. \u201cIf only to get you to shut up at Lord Ponte.\u201d He rolled his eyes. Merlin smiled brightly.</p>\n<p>\u201cI can\u2019t wait to see the prat\u2019s face.\u201d He beamed. Arthur sighed. It was amazing Merlin had lived so long with his blatant disrespect of some nobles. Granted, it wasn\u2019t everyone, but if he didn\u2019t like someone it wasn\u2019t at all discreet. Probably most of the castle would be familiar with his servant\u2019s disapproval towards the visiting noble. He hoped after the ceremony this afternoon he would never have to hear about him again.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou look exhausted.\u201d</p>\n<p>Arthur blinked in confusion as Lord McGuire glanced over in his direction. He didn\u2019t feel particularly tired, nor had he been missing much sleep. His confusion must have shown on his face because the older man chuckled.</p>\n<p>\u201cI was speaking to your servant, sire.\u201d He bowed his head \u201cI apologize for the lack of clarity.\u201d</p>\n<p>Brows crinkling together, Arthur turned to look at Merlin who was behind him with a jug of wine. He did look awful. Arthur wasn\u2019t sure how he hadn\u2019t noticed it earlier. Dark circles were under his eyes and face a slightly paler shade than his usual translucent color. Arthur wondered if he was sick, hung over, or something else entirely.</p>\n<p>\u201cMerlin?\u201d He asked and the boy in question met his eyes with a jolt.</p>\n<p>\u201cUm, yes sire.\u201d He shifted \u201cI\u2019ve been helping Gaius with patients all night.\u201d He admitted and Arthur sighed. Of course he was. Merlin talked non-stop unless it was anything of actual importance. That was when he seemed to become tight-lipped about everything. Pinning him with a hard look he nodded.</p>\n<p>\u201cGo get George then.\u201d He ordered him \u201cAnd get some sleep, idiot. We\u2019ll talk about this later.\u201d He warned. Merlin looked like he wanted to argue, but Arthur\u2019s glare cut him off. Muttering pleasantries, he put the jug down and stumbled out of the room. Lord McGuire smiled.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re kind to your servants.\u201d He noted \u201cI\u2019ve heard you treat all members of your household with great respect.\u201d</p>\n<p>Arthur wasn\u2019t entirely sure if he had missed the part where he called Merlin an idiot or if he just had exceptionally low standards for treatment of the lower class. Either way, he wasn\u2019t going to correct him.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt appears I could stand to be more observant,\u201d He commented \u201cThank you for noticing. Merlin doesn\u2019t\u2026 Tend to understand physical health at times.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMy understanding was he was the physician\u2019s apprentice.\u201d McGuire told him, grabbing another plate of grapes. Arthur held his arms out slightly with a sigh.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt makes the frustration greater.\u201d He admitted and the lord laughed.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis why I would like my son to be trained under you,\u201d He said and nodded when George refilled his cup eagerly (how did he get here so quickly?). \u201cI\u2019m not as young as I used to be and want to know he has learned to be kind to his charges once I am gone. My own father was\u2026 Strict with our household. It brought nothing but pain and betrayal.\u201d He sighed. Arthur nodded. He hadn\u2019t really considered McGuire\u2019s son too closely for knighthood. Perhaps he was only considering his skills and not his potential.</p>\n<p>Besides the man deserved some kind of thank you for not letting Arthur work his servant to death. He really needed to talk to the moron about that.</p>\n<p>It wasn\u2019t unusual for visiting ladies to flirt with Merlin.</p>\n<p>Arthur often found it amusing. Merlin had been so profoundly uncomfortable with it at first he often offended many of them by just walking away whenever they tried to talk him. Now, he seemed to take it in stride with small nods and bright smiles that had them all cooing over him.</p>\n<p>Nobody had really given him gifts before though. Arthur shouldn\u2019t be terribly surprised. Whenever Lady Kenna visited she often looked more forward to seeing Merlin than actually greeting the King. The two had become good friends over the course of her visits where she would try and teach him Greek poetry and he would show her how to make different potions and medicines.</p>\n<p>So Arthur wasn\u2019t completely shocked when she brought him a few rare books that contained old works of Homer. Merlin had been scandalized, insisting he couldn\u2019t accept. Kenna had merely rolled her eyes at him and threatened to have him in the stocks if he didn\u2019t accept.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou can\u2019t throw me in the stocks!\u201d Merlin had replied indignantly. Kenna rose a brow and turned sparkling eyes onto Arthur who threw his servant a wicked grin.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m always looking for a reason to put you in the stocks.\u201d He shrugged and Merlin immediately tugged the books close to his chest with a glare at both of them. Kenna beamed, patting Arthur\u2019s hand affectionately before prompting Merlin to read the first book.</p>\n<p>\u201cI want to see how much you\u2019ve forgotten.\u201d She teased and Merlin gave a gasp of offense. Arthur rolled his eyes. Lady Kenna\u2019s mother was asking for help to choose a suitable suitor for her, which was both a blessing and a curse. A blessing because Arthur wouldn\u2019t have to do any work \u2013 Merlin would be passionate enough about ensuring his friend ended up with someone kind and loving. A curse because Merlin would think <em>nobody</em> was good enough for his friend.</p>\n<p>\u201cHere, you choose.\u201d Merlin told her after pushing the final three candidates at her. Kenna peered over at the men, tapping her lip as if picking out a dress rather than a husband. Her eyes paused over one of the names before scowling up at the pair.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Merlin</em>.\u201d She scolded, but her eyes were bright \u201cHow on earth did you get Robert on this list?\u201d She asked and Merlin gave a small shrug. Arthur sighed. Kenna and Robert had chemistry ever since they first laid eyes on one another a year ago. Unfortunately, Robert was courting another woman who Merlin was not a fan of (\u2018She called Percival a dog, Arthur!\u2019) and thus, not available. After a lot of needling from a certain servant, Arthur eventually intervened and pointed out that Lady Kenna would be a better match than his current bride to be. Robert didn\u2019t need much convincing and with the king\u2019s blessing he was free to break the engagement without consequence.</p>\n<p>\u201cI swear, Merlin.\u201d Kenna laughed \u201cYou might be the best ally to have in Camelot.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d Arthur blinked, but Merlin gave a bright smile to both of them.</p>\n<p>\u201cShe said what she said, Arthur!\u201d He beamed and Arthur crossed his arms, glowering over at him. It was a bit hard to be annoyed when he was obviously so pleased by the compliment, but Arthur wasn\u2019t one to let him get away with <em>everything</em>.</p>\n<p>\u201cEnough of you. Stocks.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThis is why you\u2019re the worst ally in Camelot.\u201d Merlin muttered.</p>\n<p>It was strange.</p>\n<p>Ever since Lady Kenna gifted Merlin with those two books other nobles began to do the same. Lords, Ladies, knights, and even some visiting kings and queens offered some sort of small trinket to Merlin whenever they visited whether it be something from their homelands or things that might help him with his duties. Merlin had been just as puzzled as Arthur \u2013 while Kenna\u2019s gift had made sense, there was no reason for all of nobility to start treating a servant this way.</p>\n<p>\u201cMaybe they think it\u2019s a sign of respect.\u201d Merlin told him after they finished eating a pie a duchess had brought them earlier that day \u201cIt is well known how you treat members of your household. They might want to show you they will do the same.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t <em>spoil</em> you.\u201d Arthur scoffed \u201cI would be satisfied if they refrained from punching you.\u201d He said, swiping his wine away from Merlin who had been trying to sneak a sip. \u201cIf this keeps up you\u2019re going to start thinking you\u2019re entitled to things.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLike you do?\u201d Merlin told him flatly and Arthur aimed a kick from underneath the table.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m the king.\u201d He grumbled.</p>\n<p>\u201cCome, boy.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSire?\u201d Merlin asked, confusion coloring his tone as he was offered a seat across from the King of Wessex himself. The man looked to be about a hundred with tiny eyes and a rather large mustache that was pure white. He patted the seat again.</p>\n<p>\u201cPlay with me.\u201d He said, gesturing to the black and white board in front of them. Merlin eyed it warily.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure I know how.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAll the better. I\u2019ll teach you.\u201d He insisted and when Merlin hesitated, offered a warm smile. After a few minutes of coaxing him, Merlin finally sat down and got lost in the rules of chess. When Arthur came by hours of later, they were on their eighth match.</p>\n<p>\u201cHave you heard of this game, sire?\u201d Merlin glanced up. Arthur was watching them with an air of exasperation, arms crossed as the other king moved one piece further up the board \u201cYou should learn. It\u2019s fun.\u201d He said, tongue poking out of the corner of his mouth.</p>\n<p>\u201cI see that.\u201d Arthur commented, disapproval heavy. Wessex\u2019s king blinked up at him, confusion lacing his brows before sending his queen to finish off Merlin.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou can keep it.\u201d He said when Merlin tried to help him pack it away. Arthur was honestly aghast.</p>\n<p>The trend continued.</p>\n<p>It seemed as though everyone with a speck of noble blood in their veins was attempting to woo him. The gifts continued, many nobles took him aside to teach him some new skill or subject (Merlin\u2019s favorite so far had been astrology), or sometimes he was invited simply for tea.</p>\n<p>Nobody knew why. Arthur wasn\u2019t entirely convinced sorcery wasn\u2019t involved. Sure, nobles had always been either charmed or horrified by Merlin. He was a bold personality you either hated or loved, but it was never to this extent.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s the cheekbones.\u201d Gwaine suggested during training. Merlin had just come back to lug Arthur\u2019s armor to him after stopped by a young prince who <em>insisted</em> on showing Merlin proper sword fighting. Arthur will admit he wasn\u2019t fond of <em>that</em> particular gesture. Especially since Arthur himself could teach Merlin if he so chose. \u201cThey look so regal. People must think he\u2019s an undercover royal.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHey!\u201d Merlin frowned and the other knight laughed fondly.</p>\n<p>\u201cWorry not, Merlin. I would never let nobility claim you.\u201d He smiled, ruffling the boy\u2019s hair. Merlin gave a nod of affirmation before handing Arthur his sword.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s so strange. What would they gain by having me like them?\u201d Merlin shook his head \u201cYou lot don\u2019t even buy me\u2026 Uh. What were they? Macroons?\u201d He said and Leon scoffed.</p>\n<p>\u201cBecause we can get you to like us with our personalities.\u201d The knight told him and gently cuffed the back of his head \u201cArthur is right. You are getting much too spoiled.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, we need to bully you more.\u201d Elyan teased \u201cGwen said last week you were given a horse of your own.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cA <em>horse</em>?\u201d Arthur repeated, eyes flicking to Merlin in alarm. The servant only shrugged. \u201cWhat the- I don\u2019t understand.\u201d He groaned \u201cYou have to give that back.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI tried!\u201d Merlin said helplessly \u201cBut the duke said no and then he told me if I didn\u2019t take her then they were just going to kill her anyways and I can\u2019t be responsible for Sylvia\u2019s death!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou named it!?\u201d Arthur asked, mouth gaping open. Merlin paused.</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2026no.\u201d</p>\n<p>Arthur sighed.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the harm?\u201d Gwen chuckled later that afternoon. \u201cThey aren\u2019t causing any trouble.\u201d She pointed out, sitting on the edge of his bed. Arthur was sorting through some papers, having been in the midst of plotting to stop this madness.</p>\n<p>\u201cI just don\u2019t understand <em>why</em> it\u2019s happening.\u201d He shook his head \u201cAre they trying to kill him somehow? What would a dead Merlin do for them?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cArthur,\u201d Gwen interrupted with a frown. She had pulled out Arthur\u2019s sword and was balancing it in her hand \u201cWhat do you mean you don\u2019t know why? It\u2019s obvious.\u201d She told him and Arthur froze. When he didn\u2019t respond, the girl sighed. \u201cThey want <em>you</em> to like them.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell they aren\u2019t giving <em>me</em> horses, are they?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo. They are giving your best friend horses.\u201d Gwen told him and Arthur stared. She stared back. For a solid five minutes they just looked at each other before Arthur spoke again.</p>\n<p>\u201cMerlin isn\u2019t my friend.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, whatever you label him as.\u201d Gwen rolled her eyes though there was something in her expression that told him she hadn\u2019t been thinking of the word \u2018friend\u2019 either. \u201cPeople know that if <em>Merlin</em> doesn\u2019t like them then <em>you</em> won\u2019t like them.\u201d Gwen explained as if speaking to a small child. Arthur opened and closed his mouth. That just didn\u2019t make any sense. The idea that Merlin had any political sway at all was ridiculous.</p>\n<p>On some level Arthur knew he should be angry people thought a servant had that much influence on his decision making, but he was more offended these nobles had been using his servant like chess piece (yes, Merlin finally got him to play the damn game).</p>\n<p>Jaw clenched, he stabbed his signature on another form. Gwen sighed. Her eyes were watching him closely, lips pushed out slightly, concentrating with pinched features.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou know,\u201d She said casually \u201cI think I can see why you\u2019re worried.\u201d</p>\n<p>Arthur paused. If he was honest\u2026 He wasn\u2019t entirely sure <em>why</em> he was worried. He just knew he was. More annoyed, but\u2026Maybe a little worried too. Gwen set his sword down beside her, clasping her hands together \u201cEventually they\u2019ll start giving him land and money. Enough so he could get a nice home of his own \u2013 which I\u2019m sure would be <em>lovely</em>. Especially when they offer him a wife or-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you insane?\u201d Arthur squawked. His quill had dug a hole into the parchment. Arthur tried to ease his grip, but it only ended up snapping the tip off. Gwen smiled. \u201cWhy would they think I would approve of that?\u201d He glowered. For some reason, the maid\u2019s smile grew even wider.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t you?\u201d She countered \u201cI mean, it would make it hard for Merlin to work for you-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThen what\u2019s the <em>point</em> of any of it? If he doesn\u2019t work for me then he has no way to tell me if he likes them or not. <em>If</em> that was a thing.\u201d He said and Gwen held up her hands in surrender. For some reason though, her expression wasn\u2019t one of someone who had lost.</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course, sire.\u201d She nodded \u201cIt was just my humble theory on the matter. Would you like me to draw you a bath before you go?\u201d She asked, standing up to dust off her dress. Arthur shot a suspicious glance, giving up on his work. For once, his chambers were clean and well attended to. He wondered when Merlin had done it, considering he hadn\u2019t seen him most of the day.</p>\n<p>\u201cMerlin will be here soon,\u201d He dismissed. He expected Gwen to curtsey and leave, but he looked up to find the girl gnawing at her lower lip. \u201cYes?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell\u2026 Merlin actually won\u2019t be here tonight.\u201d She admitted and Arthur rose a brow. Something told him he would not be fond of her next words \u201cDuke Orley requested Merlin join him on a trip to the carnival in the lower town.\u201d She said. Arthur pinched the bridge of his nose.</p>\n<p>\u201cGet me Gaius.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re <em>joking</em>!\u201d Merlin whined as Arthur steered him away from the courtroom and down the stairs, hand firmly grasping his upper arm \u201cThis isn\u2019t my fault! I never asked-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI know, but it hardly matters now, does it?\u201d Arthur asked him. He was a few strides ahead of the servant so that Merlin stumbled a bit as he was dragged along. A few muttered words under his breath had Arthur not feeling quite as bad when he shoved him into the cell.</p>\n<p>\u201cIf the guards are nice are you going to behead me?\u201d Merlin snapped when Arthur locked the door.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s only for a few days.\u201d Arthur rolled his eyes \u201cUntil the House of Newcastle leaves. I don\u2019t need anyone drooling over you while I try to organize a treaty.\u201d He said and Merlin crossed his arms. Arthur met his gaze without much remorse, smirking a bit when he jangled the key in front of him and snapped it on his belt. Fury played over the other man\u2019s gaze.</p>\n<p>\u201cRemember I\u2019m the one who brings you your food!\u201d He yelled as Arthur marched out \u201cIt would be all too easy to slip something in there!\u201d</p>\n<p>Arthur wished the guards were just a little fazed at the threat to their king\u2019s life, but neither of them even turned to look at Merlin. Great. When he came back he half-suspected Merlin would be surrounded by admirers offering to redo the dungeons to his taste.</p>\n<p>As it happened, Arthur\u2019s plan did work quite well in the end. The treaty was successful and only one person asked about his servant\u2019s whereabouts. Nobody tried to offer any gifts, lessons, treats, smiles, or favors.</p>\n<p>The dungeon was in perfect shape too. Aside from one thing.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhere is my servant?\u201d He asked the guards as he stared the empty cell. The pair glanced over at him from where they were playing chess (had Merlin taught the entire castle?) before looking at one another.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe asked to be let out.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2026 What?\u201d Arthur blinked, taken aback.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell,\u201d The guard frowned, shifting his grip on his weapon slightly \u201cWe didn\u2019t think you serious about putting him in there.\u201d He began and when Arthur spluttered the guard hurriedly tacked on \u201cWe just mean, my lord, that your servant didn\u2019t commit a crime. We figured you were just annoyed with him or something.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo, you let him <em>out</em>? <em>Without my permission</em>?\u201d He snapped out, anger coiling around his stomach.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe said you wouldn\u2019t mind.\u201d The other pouted and Arthur took a heaving breath. \u201cAnd I mean, sweet thing like him hardly can cause much trouble, can he?\u201d</p>\n<p>King Arthur Pendragon of Camelot. Son of a long line of proud rulers, knight of his land, slayer of dragons and hero among his people. One would <em>think</em> he would have enough power to keep his servant locked up for three days. Apparently not. <em>Apparently</em>, he was to be outdone by his servant\u2019s charm.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhen I come back, I\u2019ll have you both in the stocks. If not <em>worse</em>.\u201d He hissed at the pair and slammed the door back open. He was going to <em>kill</em> Merlin.</p>\n<p>\u201cCome on, Arthur.\u201d Gwaine sighed \u201cHe looks so miserable.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGood.\u201d Arthur muttered as he wiped the sweat off his brow. The training session had been intense and in the sweltering heat, he wanted nothing more than to strip off his armor and sleep the rest of the day away. The rest of his knights were in a similar position, minus Gwaine who looked as though he was too busy feeling sorry for Merlin.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt really isn\u2019t his fault,\u201d Gwaine continued \u201cWhat\u2019s torturing him like this going to do?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cKeep him out of trouble.\u201d Leon, bless him, spoke up. Arthur knew the older man would take his side \u201cDo you ever notice how often he sneaks off now? I\u2019m worried some noble is trying to get something from him.\u201d He said and Arthur paused at that. He looked at Merlin across the field. Had he been disappearing?</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, no.\u201d Elyan dismissed \u201cMerlin has always done that. Gwen said he did it when he was first hired too. No nobles involved. I\u2019m with Gwaine on this one.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTechnically, I\u2019m doing him a favor.\u201d Arthur shrugged \u201cHe needs to learn to fight eventually. How many times have we been attacked by bandits on expeditions?\u201d He asked and Gwaine crossed his arms, his eyes drifting back to where Percival had knocked him back down. Arthur had Merlin engaged in knight training for the past week, knowing there was nothing Merlin hated more than being forced to use a sword. Except for maybe hunting.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, maybe a drink will cheer him up.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo!\u201d Arthur scowled \u201cNot you too.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s my best mate. I\u2019m allowed to be nice to him.\u201d Gwaine snorted and pushed sweaty hair for his forehead \u201cMaybe you should try saying something to the <em>nobles</em> if it bothers you so badly. Nothing will change if you keep punishing Merlin for it.\u201d He said. Arthur wanted to argue it wasn\u2019t technically a <em>punishment</em>. It was productive. If Merlin happened to hate it then that was just a bonus.</p>\n<p>\u201cWater,\u201d Merlin breathed when Percival (literally) dragged him over a few minutes later \u201cI can\u2019t feel my arms. Gwaine.\u201d He said and dramatically held out an arm for the knight to place a waterskin in. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPoor Merlin.\u201d Arthur said, not a hint of sympathy in his voice. The servant looked pitifully up at him from where he lay on the ground. Arthur rolled his eyes.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Arthur said with a firm shake of his head \u201cI draw the line here. Absolutely not.\u201d</p>\n<p>From beside him, Merlin made a noise that kind of sounded like a strangled cat. For once, Arthur couldn\u2019t blame him as he looked at the mess in front of them.</p>\n<p>\u201cMy lord?\u201d The noble asked and Arthur tried not to gawk and the bewildering state of it all. Why, in any life, would Merlin ever need or <em>want</em> a sorcerer?</p>\n<p>\u201cYou <em>do</em> realize magic is outlawed in Camelot? And we do not give <em>people</em> as gifts?\u201d He demanded, eyes flicking towards where the druid girl sat in chains. Her eyes were blown wide, lips cracked and bleeding in a way that suggested she hadn\u2019t had anything to drink in a long time.</p>\n<p>The noble blinked. From the corner of his eye, Arthur could see Merlin\u2019s hands clench. Unsurprising. His servant was a bleeding heart for every cause. Looking back at him he tilted his head slightly. Merlin gestured subtly towards the girl and Arthur nodded.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d Arthur asked her and she flinched.</p>\n<p>\u201cToo loud.\u201d Merlin hissed at him quietly, and took a few long strides before stopping a good foot away from her. \u201cI\u2019m going to unchain you, alright?\u201d He said and yanked the key away from the noble, who was watching the exchange with bafflement.</p>\n<p>\u201cLela.\u201d The girl whispered when Merlin undid the locks \u201cMy name is Lela.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m Merlin.\u201d He smiled back \u201cWe\u2019re going to get you to our physician, Gaius, alright?\u201d He told her and Lela\u2019s eyes drifted to where Arthur stood. Subtly, her hand drifted to her neck. She pressed a bit more into Merlin when the king met her gaze.</p>\n<p>\u201cI have made peace with the druids,\u201d He reassured her \u201cAfter you heal you will be allowed to leave, free of punishment.\u201d He promised \u201cI give you my word.\u201d</p>\n<p>He wasn\u2019t sure what was better \u2013 Lela\u2019s relief or Merlin\u2019s smile.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo tell me,\u201d He said after the pair disappeared out of the room \u201c<em>Why</em> is my servant being gifted? It has been months and I still cannot fathom why he is in the midst of such attentions.\u201d</p>\n<p>The noble man grimaced and with a wave of his hand ordered the rest of his people out of the room. An either wise or very unwise choice on his part. Arthur gestured for them to sit at the dining table, silently hoping George would somehow know he was needed. Within seconds he heard the sound of goblets hitting the table and knew his prayers had been answered. He should really check to see if that man was using sorcery. His efficiency was bewildering.</p>\n<p>Or maybe he was just used to Merlin.</p>\n<p>\u201cSire,\u201d The nobleman started and pressed the tips of his fingers together \u201cI don\u2019t wish to\u2026Overstep, but it has come to the attention of many that\u2026 You treat the members of your household with respect.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCorrect.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd\u2026While <em>all</em> members your household receive such honorable respects from you, there is\u2026 Favoritism.\u201d He said slowly. Arthur stared. He has <em>got</em> to be kidding.</p>\n<p>\u201cFavoritism.\u201d He repeated \u201cYou mean, Merlin.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes!\u201d The noble said, nodding eagerly \u201cYes, exactly. People have seen that you regard him\u2026Differently than others in your service. With more trust.\u201d</p>\n<p>Arthur didn\u2019t understand. He didn\u2019t even trust Merlin to bring him his breakfast in timely manner.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd in the past, people who have won your servant\u2019s affections have received profit.\u201d</p>\n<p>Dear God. Gwen was <em>right</em>.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo let me get this straight,\u201d Arthur said, folding his fingers together as the man in front him awkwardly shifted. \u201cYou are under the impression if you win the favor of my <em>servant</em> that you will then win <em>my</em> favor?\u201d He asked and the nobleman shifted again.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, sire.\u201d He said \u201cThat is the common consensus among\u2026 The chatter.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe chatter.\u201d Arthur repeated and his mind flashed to all the kindness Merlin had received from other nobles. Dear God. How was he going to get himself out of this one?</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, your majesty.\u201d The noble nodded and Arthur considered.</p>\n<p>\u201cWould you excuse me for a moment?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe\u2026The <em>audacity</em>!\u201d Arthur yelled \u201cThe <em>nerve</em>! The\u2026 Audacity!\u201d He shouted again for lack of a better term as a paced the length of the armory. His knights made varying noises of agreement that seemed more amused than actually sympathetic. Arthur ignored them. \u201cCan you believe this?!\u201d He asked. Merlin shook his head, popping another chocolate in his mouth.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s crazy!\u201d He said and Arthur paused.</p>\n<p>\u201cWho gave you that?\u201d He asked, looking at his servant \u201cChocolate is\u2026It is a <em>rare</em> delicacy that is expensive.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI know! Lady Yolanda said she had extra.\u201d Merlin told him brightly and tilted the cloth to him \u201cWant one?\u201d He asked and Arthur took a long breath.</p>\n<p>\u201cHow do I fix this?\u201d He asked \u201cI <em>cannot</em> have my peers thinking I am manipulated by a servant!\u201d</p>\n<p>Merlin licked his fingers clean of the chocolate, offering Gwaine a bite.</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d He shrugged and bit into another chocolate \u201cIt doesn\u2019t seem so bad.\u201d He said and Arthur stared at him with pursed lips. Leon, for his part, did look a little sorry that Arthur was in this situation and clapped a hand on his shoulder.</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t see what the problem is,\u201d Gwaine said, snagging a few of the chocolates from Merlin \u201cIt isn\u2019t like they actually <em>are</em> manipulating you\u2026 Or Merlin.\u201d He said and sighed at the sweet taste in his mouth. Arthur sighed, but did give a small hum at that. It was true\u2026 Despite, well, everything he would say his policies had been sound.</p>\n<p>\u201cBesides,\u201d Merlin piped up \u201cIt\u2019s good. I know a lot of things about the other nobles.\u201d He said with a shrug. Arthur rolled his eyes. He honestly wasn\u2019t that interested in whatever gossip Merlin had found out during his time with\u2026 Everyone. \u201cFor example, I know Lady Helene is planning on killing her husband.\u201d He said and the room paused. \u201cWhich might be important considering King Bayard is giving him a rather large portion of his land to him that would undoubtedly be passed to her if he met a, uh, ill fate.\u201d He added and bit into more chocolate.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Merlin</em>,\u201d Leon admonished, mouth dropping as he paused in polishing his sword \u201cWhy would you not mention that sooner? The man\u2019s life is at stake!\u201d He scolded. Merlin puckered his lip out, putting a hand over his chest in affront.</p>\n<p>\u201cI know,\u201d He sniffed \u201cAnd I already told the Duke of Cassingworth.\u201d He said and paused as if waiting for there to be a gasp of realization. When he only received blanked stares, the servant sighed and put the chocolate down before glowering at them all. \u201cHer husband\u2019s <em>cousin</em>?\u201d He pressed. Nothing. \u201cFor the \u2013 Once Bayard finds out she is trying to murder her husband he isn\u2019t going to give them the land and will reward the Duke, a member of <em>Camelot\u2019s</em> court, with the land.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure what he just said,\u201d Gwaine frowned \u201cBut it sounded genius.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2026 Tricked Bayard-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI didn\u2019t trick him!\u201d Merlin objected and paused \u201cThough I did trick Prince Gerran into giving us extra grain from his kingdom.\u201d He said and wrinkled his nose \u201cWas that wrong\u2026?\u201d He asked, a little uncertainty \u201cI only did it because I knew they were just using me to get to you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Arthur stared.</p>\n<p>\u201cHave you been doing this the whole time?\u201d He asked and the servant looked around at where the knights were all watching him with expectant eyes.</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2026maybe.\u201d</p>\n<p>Perhaps Arthur should have been upset that his servant was meddling with political affairs. But\u2026 A larger part of him was almost a little relieved. It turns out Merlin hadn\u2019t been so easily dazzled by the pretty offers the nobles had for him. He should really know better than to underestimate the man\u2019s loyalty at this point.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2026Fine,\u201d He murmured \u201cFine. But Merlin you must start telling these people no and <em>stop</em> getting involved in things that will certainly have you killed.\u201d He warned \u201cIf they found out you were using them-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThey were using <em>me</em>!\u201d Merlin objected and Arthur stared him down. \u201cAlright, but I think I have a plan on how to lower taxes through Lady Trina\u2019s marriage. She\u2019s a toad of a person so you won\u2019t mind if I rob her, right?\u201d He asked with\u2026Yep. That was hope in his voice. Arthur felt as though his knights should be more appalled by this. Leon didn\u2019t let him down as the knight began to sputter indignantly.</p>\n<p>\u201cOoh\u2026 Isn\u2019t she the cow who told Gwen not to look her in the eyes?\u201d Elyan piped up \u201cYeah, we can rob her.\u201d He mused. Arthur shrugged. Fine. Whatever. It wasn\u2019t like <em>he</em> had a say in things. Oh no, not when King Merlin wanted something. Arthur? Arthur who? Camelot only knew of his highness Merlin.</p>\n<p>Preposterous.</p>\n<p>And yet\u2026He knew he probably wouldn\u2019t do anything about it. Maybe if pressed he would admit that\u2026Down. Deep, deep down. <em>Deep</em> down that Camelot was essentially a reflection of himself\u2026 And damnit, if he could give Merlin everything he wanted\u2026Maybe he would.</p>\n<p>Not that Merlin would ever find that out in a million years.</p>\n<p>Besides, he had other problems to attend to. The druids being the prime one at the moment. Despite his firm refusals, they kept sending him gifts \u2013 magical remedies, beautiful mementos from ancient sorcerers, rare blessings\u2026 He wasn\u2019t sure that making peace with them warranted such kindness.</p>\n<p>Not to mention there was the whole situation where a white dragon (yes, a <em>dragon</em> \u2013 apparently, he had not killed the last one) kept coming along and healing him whenever he got injured. He hadn\u2019t dare to mention it to anyone\u2026 Mainly for the fact he wasn\u2019t sure <em>why</em> this dragon was healing him in the first place when he was no friend to it.</p>\n<p>Why was the magical community suddenly trying to please him anyways?</p>\n<p>\u201cArthur?\u201d Merlin interrupted suddenly, brows coming together with a slight tilt of his head \u201cWhat is that around your hand?\u201d He asked cautiously. Arthur glanced down to see a beautiful band of silver with markings dotting the outside and a symbol in the middle. He touched it, having forgotten it was there.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, yes.\u201d He mused \u201cIt was a gift from a boy I saved some time ago,\u201d He shrugged \u201cGilli, I think. He was attacked by bandits and I helped.\u201d He said, with a small shake of his head. \u201cHe insisted I keep this\u2026 He said something about Emrys using it to protect me.\u201d He added with a wry shake of his head. He wasn\u2019t sure what that meant, but at any rate Gaius had only smiled secretly and assured him the ring meant no harm.</p>\n<p>Merlin, for his part, seemed exasperated.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy do they spoil you?\u201d He grumbled and held up his hands as if giving up on everything. Arthur wanted to argue that his people thought he was a great king which seemed like a reason enough to spoil him. However, Merlin had already disappeared, still muttering under his breath.</p>\n<p>\u201cI want a cool ring!\u201d Gwaine complained loudly as the exited the armory.</p>\n<p>Arthur wasn\u2019t sure how, but three days later Gwaine received, in fact, twelve different rings.</p>\n<p>Percival also happened to come across some magical armor that somehow fit him. Elyan found an old sword that he swore was his father\u2019s work from when he was a boy. Leon came across a beautiful old relic that he claimed had been stolen from his family many years ago.</p>\n<p>Merlin only shook his head.</p>\n<p>But really, he had no reason to be so frustrated. King Baylor had just gifted him with an entire library. So if anyone was spoiled\u2026It was him.</p>\n<p>\u2026And apparently this Emrys guy that people kept saying they were honoring when giving Arthur things. </p>"
