Would love to know your thoughts on the chapter, honestly every comment and dissection and favourite sentence quoting fills me with such joy. Next up is the chapter I've been building to for a while.

Oh, he\u2019s had glimpses of it. For a few short years he\u2019d convinced himself that it was something he could hold in his hands, carve into his life like the etchings on a map. He had laughed often, abrasively, disgustingly joyful. Loved recklessly. Sometimes he can still feel the way it had sat in his chest and crinkled in the corner of his eyes.\u00a0</p>\n<p>But a life like his can\u2019t contain joy for long. He\u2019d sensed it even then, pressing on the windows of Hogwarts. The outside slowly creeping in. James would smile it all away. <em> It will be okay Moony, </em> he\u2019d say. <em> As long as the Marauders stick together. </em>And he\u2019d throw his arm across Remus\u2019s shoulders and reel him back into whatever scheme they were conjuring up.\u00a0</p>\n<p>After... <em> after, </em>Remus remembers the way Lily would try to smooth over any worry. Would hold them together, tentatively, like they were all precious. Maybe she was the only one who knew how breakable they were. It makes Remus want to cry, but then... he hasn\u2019t done that in a long time either.\u00a0</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>When Remus apparates to his front door and sees Dumbledore and McGonagall waiting patiently, he almost wants to turn around and walk the other way. He knows what he looks like. His clothes are old, worn and wrinkled. He stinks of smoke and sex. He is scraped empty, a bag of bones and a fresh scar on his face that catches the light. It\u2019s been nearly three years since... and they have not been kind years to him. Remus sighs, resignedly walks forward. Then he shudders to a stop.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Between the two professors is a little boy. He\u2019s so small, Remus almost missed him hiding in the robes that swarm around him. He has messy, jet-black hair and dark skin. His eyes are green and round. His clothes hang off him and his face has a mottled, angry bruise across one cheek.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Remus can feel his breath leave his body. It\u2019s been so long since he\u2019s seen \u2013 <em> before</em>... fuck. His eyes flash up to Dumbledore\u2019s. He is wrenched apart and adrift and much too hungover to deal with this.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWe have one last thing to ask of you, Mr Lupin,\u201d says Dumbledore calmly.\u00a0</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Once he has a cup of tea in his hands \u2013 with an added splash of whiskey that has McGonagall frowning at the bruises on his knuckles \u2013 he feels less like his world is falling around his ears.<br><br>Harry, <em> Merlin it\u2019s Harry</em>, is playing on the floor, scribbling with some pencils that Dumbledore has conjured up from who knows where.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThe boy isn\u2019t safe with them,\u201d Minerva says. \u201cI thought as much when we dropped him off, that terrible night. So I went back to check after Christmas, and as you can see...\u201d she trails off.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Remus looks at Harry again, at the hand-shaped bruise on his face and the ones Dumbledore say curl around his arms. Dursley did have big, meaty hands... that one time Remus met him. Anger burns at the back of his throat as he swallows his whiskey-tea.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat do you want me to do?\u201d Remus says, tiredly. All he wants is to curl up on his bed. Smoke a pack of cigarettes. Get drunk. He can\u2019t stop looking at Harry.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cRemus...\u201d Dumbledore is gentle. Remus hates when he has that tone. Hates that he knows it will hurt. \u201cThere is no one else left.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>A bitter laugh escapes him. \u201cSo you\u2019ll curse the poor thing with a werewolf for a guardian?\u201d He stands up, can\u2019t bear to sit across from the two commanders of a war that he is still not recovered from. \u201cSurely Molly Weasley has a place in her home for another one?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cShe has a young baby and six other children, Remus.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThe halls of Hogwarts, then.\u201d<br><br>\u201cCold stone and no one to call his own?\u201d Dumbledore looks over his half-moon glasses at him. Delivers a deadly blow. \u201cJames would have wanted...\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Remus snarls. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me what Ja... don\u2019t tell me what he would have wanted, because it certainly wouldn\u2019t be this.\u201d He clenches his hands around his tea cup and looks at Harry. The boy is staring at him now, wide-eyed. Remus forces himself not to think of Lily.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He turns back to the people who welcomed a young werewolf into their school. Made sure he was warm and safe in Gryffindor tower. Assigned him to a dormitory with...<em>\u00a0</em>he still can\u2019t bear to think of them. It still hurts too much, like a bad dream. Like another life, best to forget. But he can\u2019t, not with Harry staring at him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI have <em> nothing,\u201d </em>Remus\u2019s voice cracks. \u201cNothing left. You have given and taken it all.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>McGonagall frowns and Remus can\u2019t bear the fucking pity of it. When Dumbledore looks at him gravely, he knows that he is going to pull at the tatters left of his life anyway.\u00a0<br><br>\u201cMaybe it is Harry who will give something to you.\u201d</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Remus doesn\u2019t really remember what happened <em> after</em>... after the night his whole fucking world exploded. He has snippets of celebrations in the street. He\u2019d poked his head out the window and watched as wizards and witches cried in desperate, gasping happiness.</p>\n<p>\u201cOi!\u201d He\u2019d yelled. \u201cWhat\u2019s happened?\u201d</p>\n<p>A young witch had looked up at him. Remus remembers that she\u2019d been a vision of Lily. Her eyes were filled with tears.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe war is over! He is dead.\u201d<br><br>Remus had wanted to cry. And laugh hysterically. Most of all he\u2019d wanted to sweep James and Peter and Lily and Harry and <em> Siri... him, </em> in his arms and say <em> we made it, we fucking made it</em>. Bruised and angry but alive<em>.\u00a0 </em></p>\n<p>\u201cHow?\u201d He had stuttered instead.<br><br>\u201cThe Boy Who Lived, that\u2019s who.\u201d Another wizard grabbed the girl in his arms and spun her around. She laughed delightedly through her sobs.<br><br>\u201cMerlin give thanks to Harry Potter!\u201d</p>\n<p>Remus remembers reeling backwards. He remembers the taste of vomit in his mouth when he was sick on the floor. He remembers shaking at the smack of the paper delivered by an owl, as if it were an ordinary morning. <em> The war is over</em>, it read<em>, James and Lily Potter dead at the hands of You Know Who.\u00a0 </em></p>\n<p>He remembers the owls that filled the sky in tawny colours, drowning out the sun. The Wizarding population couldn\u2019t keep up \u2013 Remus couldn\u2019t keep up, couldn\u2019t breathe, the manic, laughing face taunting him in black and white. <em> Traitor Sirius Black arrested for the murder of 12 muggles. All that is left of Peter Pettigrew is one finger...\u00a0 </em></p>\n<p>He thinks it might have been\u00a0a week of lying blankly in that room surrounded by sick and darkness before anyone came. The key had rattled in the lock. Remus remembers the old, rusted clinking. He remembers Moody grumbling <em> should\u2019ve remembered the boy sooner, Albus </em>and Dumbledore lowering his eyes.\u00a0</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Dumbledore and McGonagall leave with the promise of bringing more things for Harry. Remus waves them away and sits on the floor next to the toddler. They stare at each other. <em> What the fuck am I going to do now? </em>Remus thinks.</p>\n<p>Harry is quiet... quieter than Remus remembers him being when he was a baby. He had been such a little thing, learning to walk and babble. Clapping and smearing pumpkin mash on the walls with a mischievous grin.<em> Mumma! </em> He\u2019d say. <em> Dadda and Padf... </em>Remus shakes his head.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m...\u201d he pauses. He feels ridiculous for being scared. The boy is only four. There is very little chance of him remembering the tired, world-angry twenty year old who popped so rarely into his life between missions. But Remus had been at the birth, had held the child gently and looked into his eyes. Had watched Lily\u2019s fill with tears of happiness. And James, beaming. He takes a breath.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m Remus,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m going to take care of you. Would you like that, Harry?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Harry reaches out. Traces the new scar running from Remus\u2019s eyebrow, across his nose and cheek. Remus closes his eyes, and lets him.</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Harry says, in a thin voice. He sounds just as scared as Remus.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Remus repeats. He breathes. And breathes.\u00a0</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Dumbledore sends Molly Weasley. She pretends not to look disapproving at the admittedly-horrendous state of Remus\u2019s flat. Falling apart, chipped walls and no personal belongings. All he can afford, really.<br><br>\u201cI know,\u201d he says. \u201cI suppose finding a new place is next.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>He tries not to sound overwhelmed, but she must sense the panic in his voice. He is twenty four. He is looking after his dead best friends\u2019 son. He needs a cigarette.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSit down before you fall,\u201d Molly says. He slumps into the dining chair.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNow I\u2019ve brought you toys. Blankets. Clothes \u2013 Ron has grown out of these already and Dumbledore said Harry is small for his age. I\u2019ve also got books \u2013\u00a0for him and for you. Read them, ignore the advice you don\u2019t like and cling to the parts you do. Sleep when you can. Don\u2019t forget to eat,\u201d she pauses, looks him up and down. \u201cYou\u2019re too skinny, Remus.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cFuck, Molly,\u201d he says. \u201cHow...?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>He leaves all the questions he wants to ask hanging in the air. <em> How do I do this? How do I make sure I don\u2019t fuck him up? How do I look at him without thinking of them? </em></p>\n<p>\u201cI know,\u201d she says. She puts her hand on his shoulder.<br><br>*</p>\n<p>Remus gives Harry his bed. The boy looks like he\u2019s drowning in the duvet, a tiny thing in a sea of blankets. He doesn\u2019t complain. In fact, he barely says a word.<br><br>\u201cYou okay, Harry?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>The boy nods his head.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay, well... g\u2018night.\u201d Remus switches the light off.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Later, as Remus quietly smokes a cigarette out his window and lets the cold air soothe the anxiety-heat creeping up his neck, he hears a sound from the bedroom.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He stubs out his cigarette and quietly pushes open the door. \u201cHarry?\u201d He murmurs.\u00a0</p>\n<p>For a second, panic grips his body. Harry isn\u2019t in his bed. Instead it lies empty, the duvet pulled down so that it drips onto the floor. Remus follows it with his eyes, and sees Harry curled up underneath the bed. They look at each other.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cMiss my cupboard,\u201d Harry says sadly. He blinks at Remus tearily.</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Remus breathes. Dumbledore \u2013 or McGonagall... someone in the blur of it all \u2013 had told him about Harry\u2019s last living quarters. A tiny boy in a tiny cupboard, hidden away. But not just any boy. A Potter. James Potter and Lily Evans\u2019s son. Remus can feel the sick rising in his throat.\u00a0</p>\n<p>While Remus had been drinking, screwing around with whoever would take his scarred body, smoking in alleyways and forgetting, forgetting it all <em> so desperately.</em>.. Harry had been forgotten too.\u00a0</p>\n<p><em> What a monster I am, </em>Remus thinks angrily to himself.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry Harry,\u201d he says instead. \u201cThere\u2019s no cupboard here. But how about I stay? Would that make you feel better?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Harry nods and Remus helps him back into bed. He tucks Harry in firmly, more like the cocoon of his cupboard. He perches tentatively on the edge of the bed.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cStory?\u201d Harry asks him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Remus looks down at him and aches so sharply that he wants to cry \u2013 suddenly\u00a0\u2013 like a child. He swallows. \u201cHave you heard the one about Babbity Rabbity?\u201d He says.<br><br>Harry shakes his head.\u00a0</p>\n<p>As Remus starts to tell him the story, haltingly from memory, Harry snakes one arm out of the duvet and holds Remus\u2019s hand. Remus clutches it in return.</p>\n<p align=\"right\">\n<em>Just breathing, my hearts with you</em><br>\n<em>Thought we'd try to build a home</em><br>\n<em>Turns out I was wrong</em><br>\n<em>I was just leaving, leaving like I do</em><br>\n<em>Leaving like I do</em>\n</p>\n<p align=\"right\">- Ryan Montbleau, I Was Just Leaving</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Dumbledore urges Remus to flee somewhere remote. Hide in France. Or Ireland. But Remus... he understands how it feels to grow up hidden. A shameful secret clawing in the basement, watching other children from a distance. Wondering why the scars on his body had wrenched him from the world.</p>\n<p>His mother had tried her best \u2014 and he can't say he\u2019d had an unhappy childhood, simply a quiet, lonely one of books and cracking bones. Even when he was roaming the Forbidden Forest with animals he called pack and boys he called friends, he felt that lonely child brimming beneath the surface. An imposter who had snuck into the world craving friendship handed out like crumbs. And love \u2013 oh, well he threw himself on that viciously.</p>\n<p>He can\u2019t create the same life for James and Lily\u2019s child. Not when James had grown up bathed in so much love yet refused to take a drop of it for granted. And Lily, who knew how powerfully love could hurt but chose to wield it with kindness instead. Harry deserves that. He deserves more than that.</p>\n<p>Remus is an awful choice to give it to him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>\u201cI hope you know what you\u2019re doing, boy,\u201d Alastor Moody says as smoke fills the crisp air between them. He tilts sideways, sways a little as he rests on the wooden leg gained from a battle Remus still feels he\u2019s fighting.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Harry is already inside their new cottage, safe beneath the protection spells they\u2019ve guarded it with \u2014 Remus can hear him rummaging around, opening and closing cupboards curiously.\u00a0</p>\n<p>It\u2019s an old Order safe house, nestled by the woods at the edge of a small Muggle village. They\u2019re not too far from the high street, where kids in school uniforms nick sweets from the corner shop and gossip spreads like Fiendfyre. It\u2019s disgustingly ordinary and Remus already misses the anonymity of his dingy London flat.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHe can\u2019t grow up in the Wizarding world,\u201d Remus says. He wants to say,<em> I can't stay in the Wizarding world</em>. \u201cHe\u2019s too famous.\u201d He takes a drag of his cigarette.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Moody scoffs. \u201cAnd it\u2019s too dangerous. See what happened to the Longbottoms?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cExactly. But I won\u2019t...\u201d Remus blows out a breath. \u201cIt can\u2019t just be him and me. It isn\u2019t fair on a little boy.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>If he\u2019s honest with himself, Remus knows it\u2019s because he doesn\u2019t think he has enough love to give anymore. Harry can\u2019t live on scraps and that is all Remus has left. He needs people. Children he can laugh with, fight with, grow with. A village he can roam in freely, without fear. Oh Remus will be there watching it all, patching up scraped knees and broken hearts. But Harry needs to be filled with love. Overflowing with it.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI hear the Weasleys will be taking him at least once a month.\u201d Moody gives Remus a sideways look.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d Remus says tiredly. \u201cI won\u2019t have him anywhere near when...\u201d<br>\n<br>\nMoody flicks his cigarette to the floor, stamps it out with his wooden leg. \u201cOh I\u2019m not concerned about that shit. You know more protection and defensive spells than some of our best Aurors.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Moody looks at the gnarled and twisted trees that overarch Remus\u2019s new home, like he can see the layers and layers of spells they\u2019ve placed \u2013 some darker than others.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThis whole operation... it\u2019s not secure,\u201d Moody says. \u201cHe was meant to be with his mother\u2019s sister. Blood protection. Someone will go looking for him soon and notice that Harry Potter isn\u2019t where he\u2019s supposed to be. And it\u2019s hard to be vigilant when so many people know where and who the boy is with.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOnly people from the Order know,\u201d Remus replies. \u201cAnd even then, only a few.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Moody barks out a mad laugh. \u201cBecause the Order is so good at keeping secrets,\u201d he bites. Then he glances at Remus. \u201cYou know better than anyone, Lupin, just how blind we are.\u201d<br>\n<br>\nRemus turns back to look at the cottage, sees Harry placing his toys in an orderly line across the windowsill. Remembers the black dog plushie James had bought his son as a joke, in Harry\u2019s old life. Feels sick with the thought of his new one.</p>\n<p>\u201cI rarely make the same mistake twice.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Harry likes burnt toast with thick honey. It drips onto his plate and smears his face golden. He runs around with sticky fingers, he doesn\u2019t put shoes on, he breaks things and cries, he is so quiet sometimes Remus wants to shake him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>When he is not playing silently or roaming around the house, Harry watches him. His eyes follow Remus accusingly around their disaster of a cottage, stares as he organises books onto shelves and unpacks the mountains of blankets that Molly Weasley has knitted for them and mashes pumpkin and folds socks.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Once, after a dinner that Remus has destroyed so badly the pan smokes and sputters, Harry\u2019s eyes seem to trace his pacing as he fights the urge to throw all the dishes out the window. Back and forth, back and forth. Remus takes a deep breath.\u00a0</p>\n<p><em> You\u2019re really fucking this up</em>, every moment of silence seems to tell him. <em> You have no bloody clue what you\u2019re doing, do you?\u00a0 </em></p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Remus tries not to let himself think of the past. After, after it all... he shut himself down. Barely picked up his wand. Simply got up every morning. Went to a job at the pub. Or bookstore. Or manual labour. Whatever was around when Remus inevitably got fired. He still brushed his teeth. Dressed. It was habit, perhaps.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Occasionally Remus took too many drugs. He would drink and drink and drink and then have sex with people who looked too much like... but didn\u2019t that just prove there was still life left in him? It was too simple to give up. Too easy.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He remembers begging Dumbledore, once. When he was dragged to a safe house and thrown in a shower and told the full story. <em> Are you sure? </em> Remus had sobbed. It was the last time he cried. <em> Are you sure?\u00a0 </em></p>\n<p>After that, Remus stopped seeing anyone from the Order. There was nobody left to see anyway. But he wanted a clean break \u2013\u00a0like all other chapters in his life. Before the wolf. After the wolf. Before Hogwarts. After Hogwarts. Before Halloween. After Halloween.</p>\n<p>Perhaps that is how he knows to keep stumbling forward. One foot in front of the other. On and on.\u00a0</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>One night, Remus can hear Harry start to cry.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>Remus is already awake, can feel his bones shifting beneath his skin with the pull of the moon and the thoughts that circle endlessly like a record on repeat. In his old-new life, this would be when Remus decided to get truly plastered, would follow the hand on his lower back leading him to bed. Always someone different.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Instead there is a tiny boy with messy black hair crying alone in his bedroom next door. Remus tries not to feel tired, already. Tries not to wish for the past. Or the past-past. He pushes Harry\u2019s door open slowly.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cA\u2018right Harry?\u201d He asks. The boy is curled up, clutching his blanket and a rabbit toy with torn ears that Molly has given him. His tears trail into the collar of his pyjamas.</p>\n<p>\u201cScared of monsters,\u201d Harry says sadly.\u00a0</p>\n<p><em> Oh there are plenty</em>, Remus wants to say. Instead he settles into a calm, reassuring expression. \u201cLet me show you something,\u201d he replies.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Harry clambers out of bed and together they put on slippers and walk outside. It\u2019s dark, the moon barely a sliver. The forest in their backyard sways in the breeze and the sound of it is an angry rustle. It could be frightening, Remus supposes, if you weren\u2019t so used to winding in the empty spaces between trees.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWatch,\u201d he says. And he raises his wand so that all the forest is filled with light \u2013 the wards he and Moody placed shimmering brightly. Rabbits jump, startled and birds shake from their nests confused by the not-sun. Harry is wide-eyed, the green of the forest in the green of his eyes \u2013 like damp-new, like seeing magic for the first time.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThis is our home,\u201d Remus says fiercely. \u201cAnd no monster can pass.\u201d<br>\n<br>\nHarry looks up at him in wonder. He shuffles closer and Remus picks him up. He settles Harry on his aching hip and the boy\u2019s black hair tickles his nose. Remus remembers how James would style his when he was eleven \u2013 all sticking up and mad. How it would look after a night of frantic frolicking in the woods.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Well</em>...\u201d Remus amends, because he refuses to make promises he cannot keep. His eyes flick to the pale moon. \u201cOnly the ones we know.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>When Lily had given birth, Remus and... Remus and Sirius had been there.</p>\n<p>The cry had rung out. Harry\u2019s first. Remus had tried not to think of the cries in battle, scared and urgent. Or the howls of werewolves to the moon that ruled them. Sirius had turned to Remus. The smile on his face had been <em> golden </em> and he had kissed Remus full on the mouth, like Harry was theirs too.</p>\n<p>That moment is etched, forever. As much as Remus tries to claw it out. As much as he tries to understand how that much joy can turn to so much destruction.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lily had looked tired, when they were permitted to enter. Tired but glowing and fierce and strong. Her arms curled protectively around her baby. Her red hair falling to cover the child, like a charm warning those who could hurt him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Remus had smoothed a hand over her head and she had smiled up at him. He remembers the tears in her eyes. He remembers James shaking. So young and scared. So desperately hopeful. \u201cCongratulations,\u201d he had murmured as he kissed her temple.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Later, Remus had stepped outside alone.</p>\n<p>The night air had been cool. Remus\u2019s hands had shook as he fumbled a cigarette out of the pack and lit it with a click of his fingers. The smoke curled in his mouth and he had blown it out in a shape resembling a dragon, just like <em>he</em> used to when they were young and still learning not to cough with each inhale. Remus remembers it all so clearly, even as he tries to blow the smoke of it away.\u00a0</p>\n<p>James had snuck up behind him. \u201cOne for me?\u201d He'd asked.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cLast one before you become a proper family man.\u201d<br>\n<br>\nJames\u2019s laugh had echoed in the empty night as he took the offered cigarette. \u201cTo be honest mate, it still doesn\u2019t feel real.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou and Lils are going to be stellar parents,\u201d Remus remembers telling him. He had glanced at James, saw how fearless and tired they all were. He wants to remember James like that, forever. Glowing. \u201cI mean that.\u201d</p>\n<p>James had smiled, nudged him with his shoulders. \u201cSirius will be wanting his own next,\u201d he joked as he took a drag of his cigarette.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Remus had looked away. \u201cI\u2019m leaving tomorrow,\" he'd confessed. James had known what it meant. He watched Remus steadily. \u201cAnother mission.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAh,\u201d James flicked his cigarette. Let the ash drift to the ground.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHaven\u2019t had a chance to tell him yet. Not with...\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI s\u2019pose you\u2019ll tell him while you\u2019re packing again, will you?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cJames...\u201d Remus had sighed. So many mistakes had been made, during the war. So many missed conversations. So many raised voices. If Remus could go back... \u201cYou know I don\u2019t want to,\u201d he had said instead.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cC\u2019mon Moony,\u201d James replied with a false cheer. \u201cWe both know how invaluable that brain of yours is. Dumbledore will send you on a jaunty research trip and you can come up with another brilliant invention like your Patronus messages.\u201d<br>\n<br>\nRemus had taken a deep breath. The missions that Dumbledore assigned him made him sick. And scared. And he wasn't able to tell anyone even though the secret of it had already felt like it was spilling out. Like it was already written on his body. He had been angry, so often. Helplessly angry that none of them knew. It wasn't their fault. Remus was good at hiding. It was an art to him. But they should have\u00a0<em>known.\u00a0</em></p>\n<p>\u201cWill you be back for the moon?\u201d James had asked.<br>\n<br>\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure,\u201d Remus remembers replying, even though he had been.</p>\n<p>No, he did not return for that moon. In fact, he would end up missing a few moons, howling and clawing it away with packs that destroyed Remus piece by piece. And when he did come back, it would seem the world had shifted, slightly. Like he was out of sync with the Marauders. One step behind. Even <em>he\u00a0</em>had been different. Remus can see that now. Wishes he'd seen it then.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cJust come home, yeah?\u201d James had said simply. He had put his hand on Remus\u2019s shoulder. Remus remembers feeling time slipping through James's curled fingers as he tried desperately to hold on, to pull it back to harmless mischief in Hogwarts corridors. Friends safe and laughing by the fire.</p>\n<p>Remus had nodded. Inhaled smoke slowly. Exhaled slower. This time, a wolf leapt into the air.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>The first time Harry laughs \u2013 a proper giggling, toddler laugh \u2013 Remus feels a knot unwind in his chest. He lets the sound of it echo in him. He watches as the butterfly tickles Harry\u2019s nose, such a small thing to delight in. Such a wonder that this can still exist. He reminds himself that the war didn\u2019t take Harry like it did Remus.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He joins the boy outside to watch the fluttering of colour as more butterflies join the dance. Harry chases them, runs around him, between his legs, bumping into him and yelling \"Remy, Remy look!\"<br>\n<br>\nHis arms are skinny but the bruise on his face is nearly gone.\u00a0</p>\n<p><em>\"</em>Aren't they lovely, Harry?\" Remus replies. He thinks of Lily and how she had looked at her son like he was a miracle. Like she didn\u2019t know what to do with something so precious. And James, who cried in happiness. Laughed and loved in the darkest of times.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He hopes they can see Harry now. He hopes they can see that Remus did come home. Bruised and battered but carrying their child into some semblance of a life. He hopes they can <em> see. </em></p>\n<p>\n<em>I want someone to grow with</em>\n<br>\n<em>Songs I can sing to</em>\n<br>\n<em>And a family to cling to</em>\n<br>\n<em>But if I can't get the things I want</em>\n<br>\n<em>If I can't get the things I want</em>\n<br>\n<em>Just give me what I need</em>\n</p>\n<p>- The Paper Kites, On The Train Ride Home</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>When Remus hears the charm alerting him that someone has apparated near their home, it takes him a moment to find his wand. He kicks himself for not being more battle-ready, reminds himself of his training.</p>\n<p>But it's just Dumbledore. He ducks to enter the house, wearing a long, purple, pointy hat that Remus hopes the neighbours didn't see. He fidgets as the man peers around Harry\u2019s new home.</p>\n<p>There is a burgundy velvet sofa that sags sadly in one corner. A fireplace with no wood. Mostly-empty bookshelves. A colourful corner where Harry has run out of paper and moved to the walls instead. A kitchen with only enough pots, pans and dishes for two. There is no cupboard under the stairs.<br><br>Dumbledore looks at Remus gravely \u2013 at this barely-functioning home and life \u2013 and hands him the key to the Potter vault.</p>\n<p>\"For you to take care of the boy,\" he says. \"I know money is not...\"</p>\n<p>Remus thanks him hurriedly, exchanges pleasantries that he won't remember later and throws up in the kitchen sink when Dumbledore leaves.</p>\n<p>James had tried to give him money, in those long years of war when Remus and Sir... when they were in a fight. Would hide it in bags, would turn up at his latest flat with groceries, would secretly transfer galleons to his vault.</p>\n<p>Remus remembers yelling at Lily one day, <em> I\u2019m not your fucking charity case, </em> and Lily raising an eyebrow, <em> no Remus, you\u2019re our friend so just bloody well shut up and go buy some vegetables.\u00a0 </em></p>\n<p>Now Remus has their child and fortune. He vows that every coin will be spent on Harry. Not a sickle for himself. And when the boy turns 17, Harry will be given back the vault that is owed to him. A cruel exchange for a dead family.\u00a0</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Remus spends time in the garden. The cottage has been\u00a0abandoned for so long that weeds and vines have intertwined with each other on the dense floor. It feels like he is doing something useful, when he digs his hands into the dirt and realises that there are still things in this world that grow. It feels like repentance.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>Harry helps. He puts his wellie boots on and totters around, jumps in mud piles and enthusiastically rips out plants. He asks questions, endlessly. <em> What\u2019s this, Remy? What\u2019s that? Watch this! </em></p>\n<p>One day as they work in the front garden, a neighbour wanders past. Others have been curious, some doing the circuit to reach Harry and Remus\u2019s house at the very end of the lane. Few have been brave enough to approach.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This woman is elderly, her cane tap tap taps and then comes to a stop. \u201cOh it\u2019s nice to see this place with life in it again,\u201d she muses to herself.</p>\n<p>Remus looks up. He knows she sees the scars, because her eyes trace his face. Then she flicks over to Harry. The boy looks so different from Remus. Dark skin where Remus is pale. Short and increasingly-stocky where Remus is bones.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, it will be quite beautiful when it\u2019s finished,\u201d Remus says politely.\u00a0<br><br>\u201cHave you and your wife moved into the area?\u201d<br><br><em> Oh, </em> Remus thinks. <em> This is a gossip mission.\u00a0 </em></p>\n<p>\u201cJust the two of us,\u201d he says, pointing to Harry. He stands up. \u201cI would shake your hand, but...\u201d He looks down at his dirt-palms.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNo need dear.\u201d The woman has a kind face. Her white hair reaches the middle of her back and she wears a blue dress. \u201cI\u2019m Neris. I live a few streets over.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cRemus,\u201d he replies. \u201cAnd this is Harry, my...\u201d He doesn\u2019t know how to finish the sentence. He is not Harry\u2019s father. Not his legal anything. Certainly not his godfather. <em> The son of my two dead best friends. Killed by my... </em></p>\n<p>\u201cRemy looks after me,\u201d Harry says quietly. He sidles up to Remus. \u201cWe make dirt. And soup. Dirt soup. I like it.\u201d<br><br>Neris laughs. \u201cWell, nice to meet you both. If you need anything, we\u2019re a friendly bunch. Make sure you introduce yourself down at the market.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>As the woman taps away on her cane, Remus blows out a breath. He doesn\u2019t remember the last time he\u2019d had a conversation so ordinary, so free of pain. He looks down at Harry.<br><br>\u201cThat didn\u2019t go too badly, did it?\u201d<br><br>Harry squints at him and dives into the mud headfirst.\u00a0</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>They go to the shops the next day. Remus dresses a wriggly Harry in his nicest clothes so the pair can make a semi-decent impression.</p>\n<p>As they walk along the street, they hold hands. Harry\u2019s eyes are wide. People cycle past and teenagers smoke discreetly behind dumpsters. There is no magic in the air, and Remus\u2019s shoulders relax.\u00a0</p>\n<p>They pop into the market to pick up meat and vegetables and rice and pasta. Harry caresses each carrot and potato before they choose it and Remus lets him, just to see the happiness on his face.\u00a0</p>\n<p>At the checkout, a young girl with wavy black hair scans their groceries and smiles down at Harry. She gives him a lollipop for free and he clutches it in his hands.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSay thank you, Harry.\u201d Remus nudges him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThank you!\u201d The boy chirps.</p>\n<p>\u201cCute kid,\u201d the checkout girl says to Remus. Her name tag says Gemma and she smiles at him shyly. \u201cJust like his Dad.\u201d She clumsily brushes a piece of hair off her face, looks at him from under dark, soft eyelashes.\u00a0</p>\n<p><em> I\u2019m being flirted with</em>, Remus thinks distantly. He wonders why a girl so young would be interested in a man with a face full of scars and a child. He studies her and quickly realises she is probably only a few years younger than him. <em> What a difference war makes. </em></p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s not... I\u2019m not...\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOh!\u201d Gemma says. \u201cWait. You must be the two from End Lane. Gran said you\u2019d be \u2018round soon.\u201d The scanner beeps and Gemma hits a key without looking at it.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNeris is your Gran?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSure is. The old bat likes to wander in the woods. You\u2019ll see her go past your house every so often.\u201d<br><br>\u201cShe seems very nice,\u201d Remus murmurs.<br><br>Gemma smiles. \u201cOh yes, everyone here is nice. Even the yobs over there.\u201d She tilts her head towards the smoking teenagers and her eyes crinkle in a fond smile. \u201cThere\u2019s rarely any trouble in this village, you\u2019ll soon see that. In fact, you two moving here will probably churn the gossip mill for another few weeks at least. Thanks for that, by the way. Stops them talking about my indiscretions.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>The girl winks. With her dark hair and grey eyes she looks too much like someone Remus used to know. They leave the store hurriedly.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Gemma is right in her assumption that the villagers seem to be fascinated with Remus and his young ward. They all stop and watch as the pair walk by. Harry cheerily waves and Remus nods his head. Some people wave back.\u00a0</p>\n<p>When Harry plasters himself against the window of a sweet shop saying <em> Remy, Remy, chocolate</em>, a mum with a daughter the same age smiles in commiseration. Harry can\u2019t be dragged away until they have a bag of sweets each.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Then in the charity store, an old man behind the counter grills Remus on the latest fashion in London \u2013 as if Remus has a clue \u2013 and watches as Harry carefully picks out an orange shirt. \u201cNot that colour,\u201d the man grumbles. He stands up, offers Harry a small, forest green sweater. Harry clutches it to his chest, his eyes wide. \u201cThis one suits you much better, lad. Matches the eyes.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>And in the toy store, a plump woman with a kind face coos over Harry and shows him where toys for the <em> best behaving boys </em> are. She smiles at Remus as Harry picks one from the pile.<br><br>\u201cYou can choose more than that,\u201d Remus says. He\u2019s at another shelf, selecting educational products. <em> Fuck I\u2019m meant to be teaching him things</em>, Remus thinks. <em> Not just letting him eat dirt and draw on walls.\u00a0 </em></p>\n<p>He watches as Harry pauses. Makes another selection and looks back at Remus. Remus nods and Harry smiles.\u00a0</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>They have lunch in the pub. There is an empty booth in the corner. Remus tries not to imagine Peter sitting there, already nursing a beer and waiting patiently for people he loyally calls friends but seem to consistently let him down. They would miss pub nights so regularly, during the war. Peter would be disappointed every time. Remus shakes his head and tries not to think of Peter at all.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Harry and Remus choose a seat by the window. The village outside bumbles along and they both watch, a little stunned at this new life they have found themselves in. Then they look at the menus, Harry holding his upside down and pretending to read with a frown. It\u2019s cute. It hurts Remus to think that. He wishes he wasn\u2019t the only one to witness it.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat would you like?\u201d Remus asks.<br><br>Harry gazes at him, confused.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat do you like to eat, Harry? There\u2019s bangers and mash. Fish and chips.\u201d Remus points at the pictures that are on the menu. Harry watches his finger. \u201cFor lunch.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t know,\u201d he says. Harry sounds small, suddenly. \u201cNot allowed.\u201d</p>\n<p>Remus swallows. <em> Oh</em>.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re allowed anything you want, Harry,\u201d he replies gently. \u201cShall we try fish and chips? It comes with mushy peas.\u201d<br><br>Harry looks up at him and grins suddenly. \u201cMushy mushy. Like the green slime we found in the garden, Remy?\u201d<br><br>\u201cBut much tastier.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>When the pub starts to fill with locals and Harry devours an entire bowl of mushy peas, the bartender switches the television to football. Remus watches men in red and gold run around and remembers arguing with James that football is much better than Quidditch. <em> But you fly, Remus! Fly! I won\u2019t have this slander. </em></p>\n<p>Suddenly, a man behind them starts to yell. \u201cOi what does the ref think he\u2019s doing!? Bloody bastard!\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Remus flinches at the sound. He\u2019s thrown back into a battle during the war, one of many that sneak up on him in the strangest of moments. With green and red bolts of light. Bodies thudding to the floor. Maniacal laughter and dark red blood that drips from Remus\u2019s neck.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Sirius screaming, <em> you fucking bastard, </em> in between curses and his friends out there \u2013 defenseless and duelling and Remus can\u2019t <em> see </em>them and Sirius pulls him back against him, hard, protects them with a shield charm and... he takes a deep breath and a shaky sip of his beer. Tries to clear his head.\u00a0</p>\n<p>What he doesn\u2019t miss, even in the midst of his own panic, is that Harry had flinched too. <em> Harry had flinched too. </em>Had raised his arm to protect his face. The boy has tears in his eyes that he tries to blink away. The man behind them is grumbling under his breath.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Remus reaches across the table towards Harry, touches his hand gently. \u201cHey,\u201d he says quietly. \u201cHow about we take all this home and crack open some toys, yeah?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Harry nods.\u00a0</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>That night, Harry crashes to sleep on the sofa. His black hair sticks up. His limbs are splayed and every so often he murmurs to himself. Remus watches him in silence. Pulls a blanket over the boy and reassures himself with every rise and fall of his little chest. Every breath. Every smile in his sleep.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He goes outside for a smoke. The air is cold and the moon nearly full. Soon it will be time to drop Harry at the Weasley\u2019s and become a beast, once again. Soon it will be Halloween, and three years since...\u00a0</p>\n<p>Remus looks up at the stars. It\u2019s a clear night. He remembers Astronomy lessons in the tower, James and... him, making mischief in the corner. Remus had been partnered with Peter. The poor boy had been scared of the centaur that taught the class. His hands had shaken the telescope and moved it slightly out of position. <em> I can\u2019t see</em>, Peter had said despairingly. <em> It\u2019s all just darkness.\u00a0 </em></p>\n<p>Not long after Peter had been killed, his mother had been given an Order of Merlin. Remus had been drunk when he\u2019d seen the picture in an old copy of the Prophet, her hands shaking as she held the medal and tried not to cry. It was a very poor price to pay for betrayal.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat I don\u2019t understand,\u201d Remus had pleaded with Dumbledore. \u201c...is why? Why, why, why.\u201d His voice had been hoarse. He\u2019d been yelling.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWe may never know, my boy<em>,</em>\u201d Dumbledore had said.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cBut he... he loved us.\u201d Remus had been empty and angry. What he wanted to say was, <em> but he loved me</em>. But he didn\u2019t. He couldn\u2019t. To say it out loud was to say the truth of the matter, which is that maybe he never did.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Remus finishes his cigarette. He looks up at the sky one last time. And if he is drawn to the Canis Major constellation and traces it angrily, hungrily, with his eyes... who is there to judge him? Nothing but the darkness.</p>\n<p>\n<em>They say that suffering will make a woman wiser</em><br>\n<em>I hate being asked if I am some sort of survivor</em><br>\n<em>But all I know is I have kept myself steady</em><br>\n<em>I walk that line between the darkness and the ready</em>\n</p>\n<p>- Nadia Reid, High &amp; Lonely</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Remus can\u2019t get out of bed. He can feel the pull in his bones, in the way they ache and splinter in his body \u2013 ready to crack with the rise of the moon. <em> A case of the monthlies</em>, he thinks in a voice that echoes from the past. Lily, by the fire.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Over the years, Remus has carved shapes out of himself. He doesn\u2019t mean physically \u2013 though he has done plenty of that too \u2013 but the necessary removal of parts that simply hurt too much. He tears at them like the wolf tears at his face or gnaws at his foot. Get rid of the source quick, before it can fester and gangrene and infect the rest of the body.\u00a0</p>\n<p>But when it is the moon. When the wolf hides beneath a single layer of skin, ready to hunt and fight and feast and fuck and... the shapes he has carefully removed slam back in and the memories overwhelm his senses, reverberate like pain up and down his weak, human body.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Shapes like Hogwarts. The slope of the grounds. The circle moon over the lake. And Prongs, their steadfast leader galloping in joy. Or Wormtail, riding high on antlers. And, and... <em> Padfoot</em>. With the wolf. By its side, nipping and playful and running and licking. Oh, on the full moon the pack would run and it was recklessly free.</p>\n<p>Every moon after, <em> after</em>, has been empty. And the wolf has been angry. It misses Padfoot in a desperate amplification of all the ways Remus does. It misses home. It misses love and family. So it takes it out on the closest thing there is.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Remus closes his eyes and takes a deep, trembling breath. Tries not to <em> feel </em>even as his body shudders in a sick practice run of the shift. Tries to resist, like always. Fails, like always. He knows he needs to get up. He needs to make Harry breakfast. He needs to watch him buzz about outside in beautiful bursts of innocent energy and laugh and learn and, and, and...\u00a0</p>\n<p>Instead, Remus lies there. And eventually Harry finds him. He climbs up into bed and slips under the covers. Rests his head on Remus\u2019s chest. Harry seems to understand silence. It\u2019s something they have in common, even though Remus wishes desperately they didn\u2019t. The need to be still \u2013 for a moment. The pain that can choke a single second.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The tiny child opens a book \u2013 one they picked out from the store together. Remus sits up. He reads the words but doesn\u2019t hear them. Harry seems content. His weight anchors Remus. A centre point, a fixture to the world that he will disappear from. Another person here, to hold his bones together for as long as they can.\u00a0</p>\n<p><em> Pack, </em> his mind whispers. <em> Pack, pack, pack, pack...\u00a0 </em></p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Eventually, Remus and Harry stumble downstairs. It is late in the day, the afternoon sun is leaking across the ground and warming the garden with a golden hue. They make sandwiches. Harry eats five. Remus chews on one, doesn\u2019t taste it.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou know what\u2019s happening, don\u2019t you Harry?\u201d Remus says. He won\u2019t, he <em> can\u2019t </em> lie. Not to Harry. Not about this.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cRemy turn into a wolf,\u201d Harry says. The boy looks up at him from under a dark fringe of hair.\u00a0</p>\n<p><em> I need to get that cut, </em> Remus thinks absentmindedly. <em> No, I need to ask him if he wants it cut. I need, I need</em>... he feels his stomach turn. He feels his body turn. Preparing, preparing... <em> \u00a0 </em></p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d he replies instead. \u201cYou\u2019ll be staying with Molly, you remember her? She\u2019ll be having you for a sleepover. You can play with her son Ron, he\u2019s the same age as you. And in the morning, I\u2019ll come and get you. That sound okay?\u201d<br>\n<br>\nHarry watches him gravely. \u201cRemy be okay?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p><em> Oh Harry. </em>Remus wants to hold him, suddenly. Wants to stay in their own pocket of the world that they have carved out, together. Wants to put it in a pensieve and live it over and over, the heady mixture of happiness and pain. Can\u2019t bear to forget how they can coexist and make each other sweeter.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYes Harry,\u201d he says tiredly. \u201cI\u2019ll be okay.\u201d<br>\n<br>\nIt is maybe the first lie he has told Harry. Maybe.\u00a0</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p><em> Darling</em>, Remus remembers Sirius kissing into his ear in the morning after a full moon, when it was just the two of them curled on a splintered, wooden floor. <em> Darling, wake up. </em>Sirius\u2019s callused hands had traced the new, open and bleeding wounds that dripped onto the ground. Had helped patch the tears up tenderly, like they were something to still be loved, even when they hurt. Especially when.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Remus blinks his eyes open. He is alone. His pain is his. It leaks unhindered onto the floor. He lets it, for a long time. Doesn\u2019t let himself think that maybe he likes it. Maybe he deserves it. For letting himself have something so fucking beautiful and for letting war destroy it. For all the ways he let Sirius down. For all the ways Sirius let him down. For not seeing it until it was too late, and his friends were dead. For the fights. And the fucks. And the love. Oh, the love.\u00a0</p>\n<p>*<br>\n<br>\nMolly takes in Remus\u2019s haggard appearance when he arrives to pick up Harry the next day. She shakes her head. Her eyes don\u2019t leave the new scars that stretch across Remus\u2019s throat in a panicked swipe to remove a voice before it can howl out all the misery that is contained within.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cRemus...\u201d She is soft. He hates it. Remembers why he avoids people around full moons. Why he avoids people in general. Except, except...\u00a0</p>\n<p>Harry comes barreling into the Burrow. His face is bright with happiness and flushed from running in the garden. He barges into Remus\u2019s legs and Remus staggers backwards with a grunt. Clutches the child to him in a desperate embrace. Oh. Oh.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Later that night, the adults have tea together. Arthur is home. Remus\u2019s hands shake as he takes sip after sip. His bones feel heavy, his skin still feels like it is rising and falling and shaping into something monstrous. He is not himself, he is never himself. He used to have someone to remind him who he was...\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cRemus...\u201d Arthur reaches across the table. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you let Harry stay another night?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Remus can see the boy snuggled beneath a blanket with Ron. There is a picture book between them and their eyelids are drooping in big, comical blinks. <em> He's my best friend, Remy</em>, Harry had said as he'd introduced Ron. The young pair of boys had held hands and Ron looked deliriously excited to have a person of his own.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t <em> you </em> stay tonight, my dear?\u201d Molly adds.<br>\n<br>\nHe looks down at his tea. Wishes desperately that his best friend was here, to run a hand down his back and bite his neck and work out the vestiges of energy that brim beneath the fingertips and toes of a body so recently transformed.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIf Harry wants to stay, that would be lovely Molly. But I will return home,\u201d he says blandly.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Harry is overjoyed at the prospect of one more night, though he checks and checks and checks with Remus. <em> Are you sure? You sure Rem? You sure? </em>And Remus reassures him twice over that he is sure, that he wants Harry to have fun, that tomorrow they will go home and no, the house won\u2019t be lonely and neither will Remus.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Arthur drops a heavy hand on Remus\u2019s shoulder when he leaves. For a man so good at pretending to be bumbling, so capable of slipping into the background, it should be unsurprising just how much he sees. Remus is still startled.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t do...\u201d Arthur stops himself. Steps back and smiles sadly. \u201cSee you tomorrow, Remus.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Remus apparates directly to the entrance of a club hidden in the north of England. The bouncer tips his head as Remus drops a couple of sickles into his hand and swipes the vial out of his palm.</p>\n<p>Inside, the walls are black and bodies press against each other. Music blasts so loudly that it shudders the shattered-and-restored bones of all who enter. It is for creatures of dark. Of night. Of pain.<br>\n<br>\nHe never would have known about this place, if it wasn\u2019t for the war and the missions that Dumbledore insisted he take on. Where pack was made of fear. And fear turned to lust and hatred and a toxic imitation of love. And these sick and scared people created places where they could be sick and scared together, occasionally. Where they could turn to each other as human bodies, where they could swallow potions that shut the world off for a blissful moment before they were flung back into the wilderness of animals. It is an underworld nobody wants to talk about. An underworld he had been sent into alone, with shaking knees and a schoolboy stammer.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Remus had been innocent, once. Had been a boy who collected books like friends and ate chocolate by the handful and kissed sweetly. Yes, there had been darkness. Loneliness and <em> so much pain </em>but... war. War was different.\u00a0</p>\n<p>In the middle, Sirius had told Remus that <em> he\u2019d changed</em>. Yelled it, really. Another night, another argument, another angry fuck with skin too tight and the moon too fresh.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Remus had known he was different. Had known that his soft edges were becoming sharp and hard. Sweaters and laughter and gentle touches had been replaced by biting teeth and armour and dark, wry humour and scars \u2013 more than ever before \u2013 more than he could explain away. He let himself become the weapon he needed to be.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Sirius hadn\u2019t changed. <em> At least, </em> Remus thinks as he takes a hit in one quick gulp and lets the green-gold magic seep into his body, feels the pulse of the music and the eyes that follow him hungrily around the room... <em> at least not until it was too late to change back. </em>Perhaps it had always lurked in Sirius, like the wolf in Remus. Perhaps Remus had been blind.\u00a0</p>\n<p>But oh, he had been so bright and beautiful and daring. Sirius had glowed during the war, him and James both. Reckless and stunning. The makings of legend. And they wore it with a humility so unexpected, even as Remus and Peter had lurked in the shadows they cast.\u00a0</p>\n<p>There was darkness. Sirius would come home with blood on his hands. Or they would be separated in battle, frantic and alone. Friends would die. Friends would nearly die. Sirius laughed a lot those days. He cried a lot too.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m scared for him,\u201d James had confessed, one late night when Remus couldn\u2019t stand the waiting. \u201cHe\u2019s too good at this.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSomeone has to be a hero,\u201d Remus had replied, and James had looked at him and looked and looked.\u00a0</p>\n<p>That night, that argument, when Sirius had come home with blood in his mouth and a curse on his lips and the names of dead friends and enemies-who-had-once-been-friends, Remus remembers how Sirius spat out <em> you\u2019ve changed </em>and how they bit and fucked and Sirius had cried.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI need you,\u201d Sirius had said. \u201cI need you to stay soft and human. Don\u2019t let me forget.\u201d</p>\n<p>Remus had gasped promises he couldn\u2019t keep, stuttered into an orgasm that brought tears to his eyes, knowing he had already betrayed him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Now, he does the same. Lets a werewolf who has dark hair that curls behind his ears and a wicked smile lead him to the bathroom. And lets them fuck. And lets his tired bones settle and rearrange and settle again.\u00a0</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>This time, Molly drops Harry at home. She surveys each room with a small smile, her hand in Harry\u2019s little one as he leads her around proudly. It is not the Burrow, none of the bustling energy and character. But it is gentle. It is soft.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Remus watches them. His heart beats beneath the sweater he has thrown on. The wolf has receded to the part of Remus it likes to lurk in while it waits for the moon to make its cycle once more.\u00a0</p>\n<p>When Molly eventually extracts herself and leaves with a gentle touch to the scar on Remus\u2019s cheek, he and Harry sit in front of the fire. Harry clambers onto Remus\u2019s lap and looks at the pictures in the book they are reading. He traces each face that peers out from beneath the word <em>family</em> contemplatively.</p>\n<p>\u201cRemy,\u201d Harry says. \u201cI like the Weasleys...\u201d<br>\n<br>\nRemus hums and turns the page.<br>\n<br>\n\u201c... And Ron is my best friend. And the twins are silly. And Molly said to call her Aunty Molly. And Uncle Arthur is funny...\u201d The boy pauses for a second. Then he twists to look at Remus in the face. \u201cBut you\u2019re keeping me?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Remus looks down at Harry. Feels his world shake and settle once more. Hears Sirius spit <em> you\u2019ve changed. </em> Lets the comedown flow over him and all the knots that the wolf tried to untangle with its claws come loose.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOh yes Harry,\u201d he says fiercely. \u201cWe are pack.\u201d\u00a0<br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p align=\"right\">All I had was you and all you had was me<br>\nThere was no tomorrows<br>\nWe'd packed away our sorrows<br>\nAnd we saved them for a rainy day</p>\n<p align=\"right\">- Tom Waits, <em> Martha </em>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Strangely, life settles.</p>\n<p>Remus has never been one to hope for a quiet existence \u2013\u00a0has never had time to hope for any kind of future, if he\u2019s honest \u2013 but somehow it rests gently in his chest. He feels... not happy, but content. He knows what to expect.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Every morning, Harry wakes as the sun does. Remus can hear the child stretch and yawn. He knocks on the bedroom door and helps him get dressed. Or sometimes they don\u2019t, instead wandering to the kitchen in their pyjamas. Harry\u2019s little dressing gown flutters behind him like a cape as he jumps down each step.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He makes honey on toast for Harry. Or porridge. Or yoghurt. Harry learns to ask for what he wants, and it makes Remus glow every time he says <em> pancakes please </em>in a small voice. He carefully arranges chocolate chips in the batter, tapping them with his wand so they dance around on the pancake. It makes Harry giggle every time.\u00a0</p>\n<p>They spend their morning in the garden. It\u2019s starting to take shape, again. Seeds are dug into the soil and bees buzz around happily. Harry gets stung by one and doesn\u2019t cry. He says <em> sorry </em> to the poor thing. Remus thinks of James and Lily... their incredible empathy for creatures capable of pain. How James would visit him in the hospital wing and say, <em> not your fault mate </em> even as he hastily healed the scratches on his arm. It doesn\u2019t hurt as much, to remember them. Not when Harry is there.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Occasionally, Neris walks past. She offers tips on pruning and planting. <em> The soil round here is tough, </em> she says. <em> But I think you\u2019re a match. </em>As a thank you, Remus makes her remedies to soothe her aching joints. She bakes them biscuits in return. It becomes a trade that makes Harry very happy.\u00a0</p>\n<p>When the weather is good, they go into town. They start to recognise more people. There is Gemma, of course. She flirts shamelessly with Remus, even as he stammers like he is sixteen. Then there is Sally, from the sweetshop. Old Julian, from the charity shop. And Tommy, from the pub. Harry likes Tommy best, because he supplies the mushy peas.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Harry joins a group of Muggle children at the park. On Monday, Wednesday and Friday they play together. Remus sits and watches him, smoking a cigarette. He thinks about friends, how tentative and important they are. How they can save lives and break them. Harry looks ecstatically happy to be jumping off equipment with other children and collecting bruises like they\u2019re a trophy of play well done. <em> He\u2019ll be good at Quidditch, </em> Remus thinks wryly.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Every month, Harry spends a night at the Weasleys as Remus tears into his own flesh and lets his blood drip onto stained floors.<em>\u00a0</em>Harry is good at not being too concerned, but Remus knows the boy watches him carefully afterwards.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Sometimes, Remus has a night off to visit a dark club and let desperate fingers dig bruises into his hips and the haze of heady potions take away the world, for a while. But the next morning he always returns, and the smile on Harry\u2019s face repairs some of the clawed pieces inside of him.</p>\n<p>\u201cAm I doing this right?\u201d Remus asks Molly Weasley one morning, when the early sun is casting a glow over her back garden and he can hear childish giggling in the adjacent room. Remus knows he\u2019s still coming down from whatever he took last night, knows he\u2019s not a perfect mother or father like Molly and Arthur Weasley. He is young and tired and <em> trying.\u00a0 </em></p>\n<p>Molly takes a sip of her tea. \u201cNone of us know if we\u2019re doing it right, Remus,\u201d she says. \u201cAll we know is that Harry is safe. And he\u2019s happy. And he loves you.\u201d<br>\n<br>\nRemus looks away. He wants to say <em> I love him too, </em> but he doesn\u2019t know how to speak the words anymore. And then the conversation is dropped as Arthur Weasley runs in shouting about winning a Daily Prophet competition. All the children clamber into the kitchen in an uproar, no pretence of sleep as they bounce about in excitement.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHoliday, holiday, holiday!\u201d They clap together as a group, and Harry claps along with them \u2013 excited for his friends and not the least bit jealous. Remus is so fucking proud of him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>When Ron shows Harry the picture of their family in the paper the following month, Harry looks up at him, stunned. <em> Ron, you\u2019re famous</em>, he breathes and Remus laughs and laughs and laughs until he chokes and Molly Weasley has to thump him on the back. The smirk at the corner of her mouth gives her away, though.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>That\u2019s not to say they don\u2019t have bad times. Harry is a child like any other. He wants to understand the edges of his world, explore where he\u2019s been told not to and look into the face of the adult in charge with a<em> well, what are you going to do about it then?\u00a0 </em></p>\n<p>Remus has been surprised by how quiet and calm Harry is. He hasn\u2019t had an easy start to life, but he seems to take <em> yes </em> and <em> no </em> and <em> stop </em> with grace. But now they know each other, and Remus can feel frustration well up in Harry. He knows he is finally being tested.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The first time Harry throws a tantrum, it is over something so simple. It\u2019s bedtime and Remus wants Harry to brush his teeth.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s important Harry,\u201d Remus pleads to the stubborn child. \u201cWe do this every night.\u201d<br>\n<br>\nHarry crosses his arms. He stamps his feet. He cries. Remus tries not to get angry. It\u2019s <em> so stupid </em> and he\u2019s tired and he wants to go to bed too. After nearly an hour of negotiation, pleading and not a single second of tooth-brushing, Remus gives up and puts Harry to bed. He doesn\u2019t read Harry a story. Simply tucks him in quietly and leaves the room. Later that night, Remus hears his door creak open and Harry crawls into bed. His breath is minty and he says <em> sorry. </em>Remus hugs him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>It continues. In town, Harry darts away from Remus suddenly. He is nearly hit by a cyclist, and Remus chases after the boy. \u201cDon\u2019t do that!\u201d He yells, breathless. He is scared, shaking. Harry watches him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSorry,\u201d he grumbles.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Remus takes another breath. \u201cMerlin, Harry. Sorry I yelled, but you scared the pixies out of me. Don\u2019t do that again, please.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Then dinner is too hot. Or too cold. Remus jokingly calls Harry goldilocks and the child screams \u201cI\u2019m not!\u201d in a huge angry voice before he stomps away. He refuses to put shoes on. Or coats. He hides in the woods until Remus sets up a barrier ward to keep him within the boundary of their back garden. He hasn\u2019t had to do that before, Harry always knew where he was and wasn\u2019t allowed. Remus doesn\u2019t like it, it feels too much like a cage.</p>\n<p>The last straw comes as they are cleaning up dinner. They\u2019d always done this together, the Muggle way. It soothes Remus to wash the plates by hand. Harry likes to play with the suds and Remus will blow them into shapes that jump in the air. Tonight though, Harry is in a mood.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He grumbles as Remus hands him a small plate to dry. \u201cDon\u2019t want to, Remy,\u201d he mutters angrily. It has been a long day and the child must be tired, but Remus wants him to learn the value of chores.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cC\u2019mon Harry,\u201d Remus replies with false cheer. \u201cJust a couple of plates and then off to bed.\u201d<br>\n<br>\n\u201cDon\u2019t want to go to bed. I want to play.\u201d He slams the plate onto the counter. Remus winces.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe can play tomorrow, Harry,\u201d he says, handing the boy another plate. \u201cWe\u2019ll go to the park, you like the park don\u2019t you?\u201d</p>\n<p>Then Harry screams, \u201c<em>No!\u201d </em> His voice is filled with anger and he throws the plate on the ground at Remus\u2019s feet. It shatters between them, and the sound is violent and stark against the quiet of the kitchen and the gentle suds that well up from the sink.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHarry!\u201d Remus finally yells. Not out of anger, but shock. The shards of ceramic are scattered all over the kitchen floor. Remus frantically scans Harry up and down to make sure no jagged pieces have hit him. He moves towards him. \u201cAre you oka-\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>But Harry flinches back, defensive. Tears burst from his eyes. Remus is astounded at the fear he sees in them. At how small and scared Harry looks. <em> Is this what it\u2019s been about? </em> Remus thinks. <em> Does he not know? </em>Harry scrambles away to his room without a word. Remus takes a deep breath and follows him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The small, dark-haired boy is curled up on his bed. His breath is coming in huge, gasping sobs. It is pitiful and makes Remus ache. He perches on the edge of Harry\u2019s bed.</p>\n<p>\u201cHarry,\u201d Remus says gently. He pauses. \u201cHarry, I want you to know that no matter what you do, I will never, <em> ever </em> hit you.\u201d<br>\n<br>\nHarry turns around to face him. He is streaked with tears and snot. Remus wants to <em> kill </em>the Dursleys in a sudden, murderous rage. He takes another breath. He reaches a hand out tentatively and Harry leans into it. Remus strokes his hair.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWe don\u2019t hit in this house. We don\u2019t touch anyone in anger. We don\u2019t touch anyone if they don\u2019t want to be touched.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>The child shudders and Remus lies down next to him properly. Harry curls against his chest and his sobs die down. \u201cWe can feel angry, or frustrated or sad. But we talk about it. We say <em> why</em>, okay? We don\u2019t hurt each other.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry for throwing, Remy,\u201d Harry says. His voice hitches, he still sounds scared. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to hurt... I didn\u2019t <em> mean</em> to... \u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI know Harry,\u201d Remus reassures him. \u201cSometimes our emotions want to explode. But when they do, I want you to talk to me, okay? And we can go outside and kick a ball or we can run in the woods or draw or play loud music, or... or we can go and yell at the trees, not that they deserve it. Sometimes yelling can help, though.\u201d<br>\n<br>\nHarry giggles.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd then we\u2019ll go back and finish what we were doing. Okay?\u201d<br>\n<br>\nHarry nods against him. \u201cOkay.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>With a groan, Remus gets off the bed. He feels the enormity of the responsibility he has, now. Not just to feed and clothe Harry, but to help him be safe and kind and grow into a good man. To guide and nurture. Remus doesn't know how a fuck-up like him will do it. But he's trying. <em>Merlin </em>he's trying.<br>\n<br>\nTogether, they go back downstairs. Harry and Remus pick up each shard by hand \u2013 carefully \u2013 because if you\u2019re going to break something you are going to fix it, too. They finish washing the dishes. They go to bed. And as Remus is tucking Harry in for the night, Harry reaches up and says \u201cI love you,\u201d and Remus feels as shattered as a ceramic plate on the kitchen floor.\u00a0</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Halloween arrives. Remus spends the night smoking cigarette after cigarette until his mouth and fingers and hands and <em> everything </em> smell of ash. The Potter home had been burnt to a crisp from the force of the Killing Curse. Remus can <em> taste </em>it. Can taste the anger.</p>\n<p>He watches Harry sleep, that night. The scar is stark on his forehead, a white line that splits and multiplies through dark skin. It moves every time Harry breathes or frowns or smiles. Like a curse moving through the air.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The other day, Harry had asked Remus if he had parents. \u201cAmelia said that everyone has them,\u201d he\u2019d enquired innocently. Remus had known the question would come, but he didn\u2019t expect... not so <em> soon.\u00a0 </em></p>\n<p>\u201cOh yes Harry,\u201d Remus had replied. \u201cYou had parents. And they loved you very much. But they died. Do you know what that means?\u201d<br>\n<br>\nAnd Harry did, because of books. And because he had friends who talked about such things, as children do. Harry had cried as Remus held him and then he\u2019d looked at Remus and said, \u201cI have you now,\u201d as if that was enough. It wasn't. It isn't. Remus knows he is an incredibly poor substitute for James and Lily Potter.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Now he thinks, <em> I love you, I love you, I love you, </em>desperately at a sleeping Harry because he can't say it, only hope that it is half the amount of love that his parents had for him. Hopes that it will help Harry dream well, even through the most terrible night.</p>\n<p>Eventually, Remus goes back outside. He smokes more. He does not look at the stars.</p>\n<p>Remus bitterly knows love cannot cure all. Because if love was enough, James and Lily would be alive and desperately happy. Harry would be safe and free of scars. Peter would be badly singing nursery rhymes. And Remus...\u00a0</p>\n<p>If love was enough, Sirius Black would not have killed them. He would have loved them enough. Remus would have loved Sirius enough. <em>But, </em> he thinks angrily as he remembers harmless pranks-turned attempted murders and angry fucks and cold arguments. <em> Sirius was always very good at hurting the people he loved.\u00a0 </em></p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Harry and Remus decide one morning to walk to the markets. They slip on their coats, wrap scarves around their necks and Harry pulls on the giant red boots that Old Julian had saved especially for him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Hand in hand, they trudge up to the shops. They wave at Neris, who is sitting on her porch. She smiles in return, but seems distracted by the radio next to her. Remus can\u2019t hear what is being said, but she looks worried.\u00a0</p>\n<p><em> Perhaps some bad Muggle news</em>, Remus thinks. He has kept away from Wizard newspapers since he and Harry moved to the village. He is too afraid that he will see Harry\u2019s name pop up and the anonymity of their small world will be shattered. If there is something to report, he knows Dumbledore will tell him.</p>\n<p>When they get to the high street, it is strangely empty. Remus feels something prickle at the back of his neck. He pulls Harry closer to him. There are no mothers pushing prams or laughing groups of gossiping locals. Instead people are hurrying to their next location or whispering in hushed tones.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cBad stuff,\u201d someone mumbles to their friend as Harry and Remus walk past. \u201cSerious...\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>They\u2019re gone before Remus can hear more. If he hadn\u2019t been so comfortable in the village and in desperate need of food, Remus would have turned back home. Instead, he and Harry do their shopping quietly \u2013 clearly affected by the mood.<br>\n<br>\nGemma isn\u2019t at the cash register, but the man who rings them up is distracted as well.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt seems quiet around here,\u201d Remus says to try and spark conversation. The man just grunts in response. They leave the store quickly.</p>\n<p>Outside, a group of smoking teenagers are clumped together. They\u2019re muttering, half in excitement and half in anxiety. One boy is telling what seems to be a particularly gruesome story and a girl hits him. \u201cThat\u2019s <em> so </em>not funny!\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOi!\u201d Remus says before he thinks. He shields Harry behind him, who is looking up at Remus worriedly. \u201cCan any of you lot tell us what\u2019s going on?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>The girl looks from Harry to him and back again. \u201cHaven\u2019t you heard?\u201d She takes a drag of her cigarette. Blows out smoke. \u201cThat crazy bloke from a couple of years back... the one who bombed all those people in London? He\u2019s escaped from prison. What a fucking riot. Got half of England hunting him down.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Remus goes hot. Then cold. Then hot again. He drops all the groceries on the ground, yoghurt splatters and fruit rolls away. Harry lets out a yelp. He clutches Remus.<br>\n<br>\n\u201cWatch it mate!\u201d The girl yells.</p>\n<p>Remus picks up Harry. He runs.\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"right\">He operates on a low frequency<br>To take down the pillars of our society <br>Walking out of sadness, walking out of grief <br>He's walking out of badness and walking like a thief</p>\n<p align=\"right\">- Johnny Flynn, <em> Raising the Dead </em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Remus apparates directly into his living room with a violent pop. It looks obscenely normal. Harry\u2019s drawings are still scattered on the floor and blankets thrown on the velvet sofa. The fire is on, the wood collapses in a giant <em> crack </em>and ash flies up the chimney.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Harry screams, clutching his ears.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m <em> sorry</em>!\u201d Remus mutters as he holds the boy close to his chest. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, fuck Harry, sorry.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>He paces around the room, Harry in his arms. His cries soften as Remus shushes him. He shouldn\u2019t have apparated with a child so young \u2013 too dangerous, too painful for them \u2013 but he had to get out of there. Had to get home \u2013 they were too exposed, too... fuck.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Remus stops. The wards are pulsing in alarm. He can feel the magic of them in his arms, vibrating up his chest to choke him. He puts Harry down on the couch and crouches in front of him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI need you to stay here, okay? This is important, I need you to stay.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Harry nods. He hugs a blanket to himself and cries silently. Remus kisses the top of his head, casts a shaky protego around him and stalks outside the house. His wand hums in his hand. He hasn\u2019t felt like this in so long \u2013 adrenaline fired and desperate and <em> scared </em> \u2013 but he remembers how it simmers in his body.</p>\n<p>The wards in the backyard are glowing red. They swell angrily. Remus can see a person trapped inside. Someone has tried to <em> get into their home </em> and Remus won\u2019t have it, he won\u2019t allow it. Not now, not ever. <br><br>He makes a cut on the palm of his hand and holds it to the shimmering barrier. Blood drips. The wards pulse again and again and... a body falls through. Lands with a thud on the garden floor.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Alastor Moody looks up at him. He\u2019s lost an eye since he was last here\u00a0\u2013 is the fight still on? Has Remus been so blissfully unaware? Of course he has, because Sirius Black. <em> Sirius fucking Black </em>is escaped. Moody\u2019s new eye swivels around madly. It fixes on Remus. The man smiles, savage and deranged.</p>\n<p>\u201cAdded a couple of darker wards since I was here last, hey boy?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>\u201cWho knows where we are?\u201d Remus says, pacing back and forth in the kitchen.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Harry is settled at the table. He\u2019s scooping up ice cream with his fingers. His face is still teary but not as panicked. Moody watches in fascination as chocolate drips onto the table in front of the boy. He looks like wants to laugh. Instead, he turns to Remus.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDidn\u2019t I tell you? I told you. Constant vigilance. Too many people.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Remus slams his hand down on the table. Harry looks startled, so Remus takes a deep breath. <em> When you feel your emotions ready to explode, Harry...\u00a0 </em></p>\n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s me and you,\u201d Remus continues. He had checked Moody with every diagnostic scan he could think of. Had questioned him on things only Moody would know. Secret missions Remus had been responsible for. Had given him potions to reveal polyjuice and veritaserum to confess his true name. He was Alastor Moody. \u201cThere is Dumbledore. Minerva McGonagall. And Molly Weasley. They are the only people who have set foot in this house.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNeighbours?\u201d Alastor leans back on his chair. He swings carelessly. <br><br>\u201cThey walk past, but no one has been in. Not a single person has been through the wards. We\u2019re basically unplottable. Even if the townspeople were asked where we lived, any directions they gave would be confunded. End Lane. That\u2019s all they know. And they couldn\u2019t tell anyone where that is if they <em> tried.</em>\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNeris knows,\u201d Harry pipes up.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Moody\u2019s eye swivels to him. Then back to Remus. \u201cNeris?\u201d <br><br>\u201cShe\u2019s an elderly neighbour. Yes, maybe she has seen through the wards enough times. She could probably give the most detailed description of our house and where it is. She walks past a few times a week. They all know our names though. We talk to them. We... They...\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSloppy, Remus. Sloppy.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t you think I...\u201d Remus runs a hand through his hair. \u201cI know, okay. I know. But how could we <em> expect... </em>\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Moody grunts. The front legs of his chair slam back on the floor with a solid <em> thud. </em>Remus leans his palms down on the table and closes his eyes. He breathes. He breathes again.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSo you weren\u2019t expecting him.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Remus looks up at Moody, confused. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll come right out and say it. You\u2019re not working with Black, are you?\u201d</p>\n<p>Remus staggers away from the table. His back hits the sink. It bruises his spine in a sharp ache. Is this what they think of him? Is that what Dumbledore has sent Moody to check? That he\u2019s not harbouring a criminal... that he\u2019s not playing house with the man that killed Remus\u2019s friends and Remus himself, for a long time.</p>\n<p>\u201cAfter all this?\u201d He breathes. \u201cYou think that after everything I have done for the Order, everything I have <em>done</em>! And everything that <em>he has done</em> to destroy my life, you still think that I would work with him?\u201d <br><br>\u201cWe all know what he was to you, Lupin.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>The worst thing is that Moody isn\u2019t even accusing Remus. His tone may not be gentle, but it isn\u2019t angry. Facts. Hard facts. Remus grits his teeth. He will be defined by this forever. His love will be twisted and used to make him suspicious, forever. Just like the wolf. Another mark against his name. He is so, so tired.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI will never, <em> ever </em> let any harm come to Harry. Even if I have to...\u201d He looks at Harry. The child\u2019s eyes are large, they\u2019re flicking back and forth between Remus and Moody like he\u2019s watching a close Quidditch match. <em> Even if I have to kill the man I loved. </em> <br><br>Moody sighs. \u201cGood to know.\u201d <br><br>*\u00a0</p>\n<p>Remus gives Moody his bed and sleeps with Harry instead. Harry curls up against his chest and shivers. Remus piles more blankets onto him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHarry, today was scary. And you\u2019re allowed to be afraid,\u201d he says into the dark of the night. The wards have doubled, tripled in strength. Moody is assigned to the house and they have to stay within the boundaries of it. Remus is glad, for once, to be away from the hunt. It hurts too much. \u201cI\u2019m afraid too. But we will protect each other. You and me. In it together.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Harry nods. Remus can feel tears soaking his shirt. He brushes Harry\u2019s hair with his fingers, traces his scar and hums.\u00a0 <br><br>\u201cWhy does the scary man want us?\u201d Harry asks eventually. Remus had told Harry, gently, about Sirius Black. Had sat on the sofa and blankly narrated the story like he was an outsider reading a particularly gruesome tale.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He hasn\u2019t told Harry that the mass murderer is his godfather. Only that he worked for bad people and killed Remus\u2019s friends \u2013 his <em> family. </em>And that Harry and Remus may be in danger. He hasn\u2019t mentioned Harry\u2019s parents. Hasn\u2019t mentioned what Sirius... what he was to him.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe don\u2019t know what he wants, Harry. But you\u2019re... <em> we\u2019re </em>important to him. So we\u2019re going to keep quiet and safe until he\u2019s caught, okay? We\u2019ll stay in the house.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Harry lets out a small sob. \u201cBut... miss Neris. And Amelia. And Tommy.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ll see them again, Harry. When it\u2019s safe.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t say <em> I promise</em>. He can\u2019t make the words form in his mouth. He doesn\u2019t know, anymore. Too many things have been taken away from him and he can\u2019t... he can\u2019t let Harry be one of them. This life, so tentative and new. It\u2019s the closest he\u2019s felt to settled, since... since.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Harry falls into a restless sleep. Remus lies awake and listens to him breathe.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>It\u2019s tense, in their tiny house on End Land. Moody stomps around, walking the perimeter. He leaves in the morning and returns at night. Harry is fascinated by the man with a wooden leg and magic eye. He calls him a <em> pirate. </em>Remus tells him it\u2019s rude, but it seems to amuse the Auror.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Moody supplies food. Harry and Remus bake. They draw. They create stories. Remus shows Harry small pieces of magic. Frivolous. It reminds him that there can still be good created with a wand. More than blood wards, protection and war.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Harry is incredibly resilient. He cries before he takes his nap, but Remus sits with him and hums mindless tunes. He understands the way fear can burst from a body.\u00a0</p>\n<p>One evening when Moody is back from patrol, the two of them drink whiskey at the kitchen table in silence.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re good at the kid thing,\u201d Moody says. \u201cDidn\u2019t expect that.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Remus sighs. He has sheltered Harry, fed him, given him a home and a scarred version of love. But he has not been able to protect Harry from his greatest mistake. \u201cNot good enough,\u201d he replies.\u00a0</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>For once, Remus lets himself remember the past. It has been so long since he has uttered the name Sirius Black that the shape of it is foreign in his mouth. The memories, so carefully compressed like coal, are starting to crumble back into existence.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He smokes cigarette after cigarette out open windows. He doesn\u2019t dare step foot outside and it makes him angry. Anxious. He can feel the wolf pacing around his body like a caged animal, desperate to be free. Even now, Sirius can control his life.</p>\n<p>Remus will never love anyone like he had loved Sirius. For seven years, his world shaped itself around Sirius Black. He is the beginning and end of all Remus\u2019s experiences \u2013 blissfully good and unspeakably bad. His laughter still echoes in lonely nights when Remus finds another warm body to fill his own. His anger still stings. Sirius was so, <em> so </em>alive.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The betrayal of it all had perhaps been so shocking in its abruptness because there was simply nothing Remus could pour into the empty mould left behind. Remus found, suddenly, that he could no longer be happy or unhappy. The person that had defined those emotions \u2013 who had created plenty of them \u2013 didn\u2019t exist anymore. Perhaps had never existed, in the end.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Their last argument had been silent. Polite, like two distant strangers. Remus had packed his meagre belongings. He\u2019d already had an apartment ready up north that he would use as a base for his last mission. Remus and Sirius\u2019s house was no longer a home, instead an empty vessel where two angry people occasionally met.\u00a0</p>\n<p>They had looked at each other for a long time. Sirius had seemed tired. There was no hint of the violence that was to come. Remus remembers wanting to cry, for Sirius to hold him and tell him that it would all be okay. Instead, he\u2019d said nothing. How do you tell the person you love in the middle of a war that you don\u2019t want to fight anymore? That you\u2019re exhausted, when you know they are too. That it hurts too much, when you know they are hurting too. That you simply don\u2019t like it anymore.\u00a0</p>\n<p>War had drained Remus. He was half man, half wolf. And Sirius hated him for it. All the Marauders had looked at him differently. But Sirius had been two extremes too. Half violently angry \u2013 every conversation bitingly sour and every fuck bruised. And the other half aristocratically cold. A perfect Black. Too perfect, Remus now knows.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He feels the smoke of his cigarette curl in his mouth. He lets it fill his chest and breathes the rest out into the empty, cold night. Sometimes, he thinks he can still smell Sirius in the air \u2013 the Sirius he likes to remember best \u2013 wet, dog-nose, tobacco, teenage boy and a grinning spark of danger. Just a spark... waiting to be lit. <br><br>*</p>\n<p>The Patronus lands in the kitchen with a brilliant blaze of power. Moody and Remus shield their eyes from where they sit at the table \u2013 nursing their whiskey and pointedly not talking about all the people who have died.\u00a0</p>\n<p><em> Sirius Black is at Hogwarts, </em> it says in Dumbledore\u2019s voice. <em> Alastor, we need you here.\u00a0 </em></p>\n<p>Moody grumbles as he gets up. He gives Remus a long look. His new eye swivels from Remus\u2019s clenched hand to the blank, straight set of his mouth. He apparates away without a word.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Remus takes a sip of his whiskey. And another. And another.\u00a0</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>When Dumbledore appears at the front door, it feels like an omen. Moody is next to him. His wooden leg thumps on the ground as they walk up the path. The pair are strangely somber. It\u2019s an echo of war, when they found Remus covered in his own sick. Empty, <em> empty </em>of everything.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Harry curls his arms around one of Remus\u2019s legs and peeks out at the two men. His weight keeps Remus on the ground. Otherwise, he would drift helplessly away.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s dead, isn\u2019t he?\u201d Remus says.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Dumbledore replies. His eyes are calm behind his half-moon glasses. Time is floating, ephemeral between them. Remus is scared to discover who he will be when it starts once more<em>.</em> \u201cHe\u2019s innocent.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"right\">Keep your head up, hold your head up<br>\nEven though it's a cruel world<br>\nCount your blessings, you won't need them<br>\nWhen you're gone</p>\n<p align=\"right\">- Active Child, <em> Cruel World </em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The whole sordid tale spills out on the kitchen table. Remus can feel each word circle the room, the agony of the past alive. The mistakes. Blame, thick enough to choke on. He watches Dumbledore and Moody blankly. His thumb circles the edge of his favourite teacup. It has a chip, near the handle. If he presses hard enough, it will catch his skin.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou promised me,\u201d Remus aches. Harry is seated next to him. He squirms, uncomfortable. But Remus won\u2019t send the boy away. <em> When you are older, Harry. When you are older you deserve to remember this part of your life. </em></p>\n<p>Dumbledore says nothing. His face is calm, passive. Remus can feel the wolf ricochet around his body. His insides twist. \u201cI was never informed of the switch,\u201d Dumbledore replies. \u201cIf I had been, I can assure you...\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI begged you,\u201d Remus interrupts. His thumb continues to circle around the edge of the teacup. The chip, still exposed. \u201cI asked if you were sure. You promised me.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNow boy,\u201d Moody walks around the kitchen. He can\u2019t sit still. Too much of an Auror and not one particularly good at delivering bad news. \u201cWe did the best we could with the information we had. All evidence pointed towards Sirius. We all thought he was the Secret Keeper...\u201d<br>\n<br>\n\u201cNo,\u201d Remus breathes. And breathes. \u201cI was last to know, I was never <em> in on any secrets</em>...\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Dumbledore is gentle. \u201cYou thought he was the traitor too.\u201d</p>\n<p>Remus\u2019s thumb presses too hard on the chip and his skin splits. Sharp, sudden pain. Harry makes a small noise of concern. Remus watches as blood leaks from the cut in thick, fat drops. Obscenely red. He wipes it away.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Dumbledore and Moody leave soon after with a quiet, <em> we\u2019ll keep you updated</em>. Remus sits there, empty. His tea goes cold. His world rearranges itself once more. Broken pieces lay shattered inside him. Must he get on his hands and knees and pick them up again? Assemble them in the shape of a man, make his mouth move and his eyes blink? Maybe now is the time he can finally leave them destroyed on the floor.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Instead, Harry clambers up to sit in Remus\u2019s lap. He is careful as he buries his face in the side of Remus\u2019s neck. They hug for a long time, just like that. A monster and a child, both chipped. Both trying not to press too hard where it hurts.\u00a0</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>The full moon is two days later. It\u2019s a bad one.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Remus has been angry at Sirius for so long that he doesn\u2019t know what to do with the excess that spills out of him. With the guilt that replaces it. It\u2019s so unfair, the whole disgusting story of it. It\u2019s so unfair it makes Remus want to howl at the moon until his voice gives out.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The wolf knows what to do. He carves long, thick lines into Remus\u2019s face. His legs are chewed to the bone. His torso broken, bloody, scratched and twisted. The scars on his body become evidence of a crime scene.\u00a0</p>\n<p><em> Here</em>, Remus wants to point at the gaping wound in his side, <em> this is where my dead friends are. And here is their betrayer. And here is the person I have betrayed. And here are all the people who touched me when he was gone. And here is when I stopped loving him</em>. <em> And here is where I never could.</em>..</p>\n<p>When he apparates to Molly and Arthur\u2019s home, he collapses. Molly gasps and catches him. Harry bursts into tears.<br>\n<br>\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d Remus tries to say. \u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Instead, his voice is hoarse and comes out like a pained groan. Molly carries him upstairs. She puts him to bed. She smooths his hair. She slathers potions onto each cut and hums as she does. Remus tries not to cry. He blinks up at the ceiling.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cMolly,\u201d he says eventually. Her hands pause for a moment. Remus turns to look at her. \u201cI need to see him, don\u2019t I?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>He needs to. But he doesn\u2019t <em> want </em>to. It\u2019s a confession whispered in the dark. On a sick bed. Remus has said his goodbyes. He\u2019s grieved. He\u2019s drank and fucked and coped. And now the past is back. He\u2019d thought he had buried it, like every other tragedy in his life. But Remus should have known better. The past isn\u2019t fixed and forgotten. It\u2019s a cycle that rises and falls just like the moon. And once you\u2019ve been bitten, it can break you just as easily.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOh Remus,\u201d Molly replies. He knows it\u2019s a yes.\u00a0</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>The halls of the Ministry of Magic are cold. When Remus exhales, he can see his frozen breath. Last time Remus had been here, he was getting his registration number. He\u2019d gone alone, pushed fresh out of school into a world that didn\u2019t want him. Sirius had been furious. Now he feels the tattoo itch on the inside of his elbow \u2013\u00a0an echo of pain.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s this way,\u201d Arthur Weasley says. He glances at Remus. His eyes follow the fresh scars. But Remus remains silent. He lets the black-tiled walls hug him in an icy embrace as he limps forward. They see nobody. They don\u2019t speak.<br>\n<br>\nEventually they arrive at a door with two guards.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you want me to...?\u201d Arthur asks.<br>\n<br>\nRemus shakes his head. \u201cNo, it\u2019s okay. Thank you, Arthur.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>The door opens and Remus steps through. It\u2019s pure blackness. The long corridor is filled with prison cells. Each bar hums with sharp magic. Remus hears his steps tap, tap tap on the floor as he looks at the pitiful faces cut from their source of power. Some, he knows, will be innocent. Others will be Death Eaters. It is near impossible to tell the difference, these days.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He reaches the cell he is looking for. In the far corner, a young man is curled up. His clothes are baggy, filled with holes. His tears are quiet. What has become of them, the Marauders? That they would end like this, stripped bare, when they started so blissfully unaware of their own happiness. It\u2019s cruel.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Remus wraps a hand around a prison cell bar but hisses as it stings his palm. The man looks up. Oh.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Same sandy hair. Same wide eyes. But now his round cheeks are stained red with desperation. He is young and scared. He is empty and angry. Remus chokes out the words...</p>\n<p>\u201cHello Peter.\u201d</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Remus and Peter had spent a lot of time together at school. Softly hopeless. Unknowingly brilliant. Oh, Peter had been the most human of them all. Where James and Sirius were loudly fierce, daring and beautiful, Remus and Peter had a shared acknowledgement that they were both the moon to James and Sirius\u2019s shining sun. In the gentle moments, they would study together. Watch the mischief unfold delightedly. Laugh together.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Now, Remus looks at Peter in the dark of his cell. The man is twisted, on his knees as he begs. The dark mark is obscene on his forearm. His hair falls across his sweaty forehead. His nose twitches, like a rat.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cPlease Remus, you must believe me my friend. Oh, my Moony, please.\u201d</p>\n<p>He shudders. \u201cDon\u2019t call me that.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou know I couldn\u2019t stand up to him Remus, you know, you <em> saw. </em>His followers, Remus. They would have killed me.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cBetter to die then, Peter. I would have died for them.\u201d Remus turns away. He feels sick rise in his throat. The black walls are oppressive around him, each bar of magic vibrates in agony. He blows out a breath.</p>\n<p>Peter, <em> Peter, </em> did this. Quiet Peter. The one who cried when Remus showed him his registration number. The one who hid chocolate frogs in his pockets when Remus had a bad moon. Who laughed so beautifully. Who waited for them at every pub night. He had betrayed James and Lily. He had killed them. He had nearly killed Harry. And he\u2019d blamed it all on Sirius. How, <em> how... </em><br>\n<br>\nWas this Peter, this dark one, of their own creation? Had Remus, Sirius and James teased him too much? Forgotten him too often? Let war ravage him in imperceptible ways? He had sought approval elsewhere. He had found it in death. In betrayal.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cTell me why, Peter.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>The man cries. His sobs warp, echo and mix with the cries of other prisoners. He presses his face as close as he can to the bars and looks up at Remus. His eyes are the same, <em> the same.\u00a0 </em></p>\n<p>\u201cI was scared.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cTell me!\u201d Remus shouts.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Peter flinches. \u201cHe had... <em> so much power</em>, Remus. He gave it out like Honeydukes sweets. I wanted a bite, I wanted to feel...\u201d<br>\n<br>\n\u201cYou wanted power. Dead friends for power you could never harness. Never control. You <em> weren\u2019t capable</em>, Peter. He could have given you all the power in the world but you couldn\u2019t use it. Weak. <em> Weak...\u201d\u00a0 </em></p>\n<p>Then Remus sees it. Peter\u2019s face changes. Unrecognisable. Not young. Not soft. Tears gone. Sharp. Angry. His eyebrows pull in and his mouth clenches. His hands become gnarled. He is dark, dark magic. He is blood promises and snake tattoos.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, not too weak to do it though, was I?\u201d He snarls. Peter wraps both his hands around the bars of his cell. He doesn\u2019t even flinch. \u201cIt was <em> so easy </em> to be the spy. One word here, one word there. Breadcrumbs that led to the big, bad wolf. Who would have suspected poor little Peter Pettigrew?\u201d<br>\n<br>\nRemus reels backwards. He hits the wall behind him. It doesn\u2019t feel solid.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cEven Sirius, oh Sirius. He thought his beloved werewolf had finally betrayed him. It\u2019s in your nature, after all. And when he found it was me who killed them, <em> me </em>who turned them all against you... you want to know what true power feels like, Remus?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Peter presses his face against the bars. They leave bright, red marks. Like claw marks. Like madness. \u201cHis face, in the street,\u201d Peter laughs. \u201cHe was powerless and I was powerful Remus. For one, beautiful moment. I was powerful.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Remus and Harry return home. Molly has packed them a mountain of food. She kisses Harry on the cheek. <em> Take care of your Remy, </em>she says to the boy. Harry nods seriously at her.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Somehow, Remus lives. He gets up every morning and makes Harry breakfast. They go outside. The ground is frozen solid but they build snowmen with smiley faces that make Harry erupt with laughter. He catches snowflakes on his tongue as Remus watches. They make dinner together. They clean up plates. They go to bed and do it all over again.\u00a0</p>\n<p>At night, Remus sits in the backyard. He smokes. He opens the latest letter that Dumbledore has sent him. <em> Sirius is doing well. The trial is scheduled soon. Peter has confessed. It won\u2019t be long now...\u00a0 </em></p>\n<p>His hands tremble. He doesn\u2019t dare feel hope. It\u2019s a fire too small to nurture, too broken to repair. Instead he waits.\u00a0</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>The newspaper arrives with a flurry of owl wings, ferocious pecks and a solid thud as it drops onto the kitchen table. For a long time, Remus stares at it. It\u2019s folded, the front page hidden. Harry is happily eating cereal opposite him. The round, coloured loops jump up and down in the bowl as he tries to catch them with his mouth.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Remus reaches out a hand. It shakes as he opens the paper.\u00a0</p>\n<p>There, in black and white, is Sirius Black. Alive. <em> Alive. </em>He looks... not old \u2013 none of them are old \u2013\u00a0but tired. Like the world has scraped him empty, just like it has for Remus. Lines wrinkle the corner of his eyes. His hair is long and unkempt. He\u2019s still so fucking beautiful.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWho that?\u201d Harry asks, his mouth full of sopping cereal. He\u2019s never seen a picture of Sirius.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s your godfather, Harry,\u201d Remus replies softly. \u201cThe one who the Aurors \u2013 the Wizard police \u2013 made a mistake about. Remember?\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry nods. He goes back to his cereal.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Remus watches the picture. Watches Sirius. He\u2019s in front of a crowd. He seems bewildered. Overwhelmed. None of the Black aristocracy. Just a young, scared man. Sirius's eyes gaze in front of him, grey and stormy. The photo makes it seem like he is searching the reader. Secrets, exposed. Remus desperately wants to catch his gaze. He can\u2019t bear to.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Instead, he moves his eyes to the headline. In thick black font it screams the same three words that have been on repeat since Dumbledore dropped them on his front step. <em> SIRIUS BLACK INNOCENT. </em></p>\n<p>For the first time, it is real. Sirius is free.\u00a0</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>There is a knock on the front door.\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"right\">Maybe I'm too young<br>To keep good love from going wrong<br>But tonight, you're on my mind so<br>You never know<br>- Jeff Buckley, <em> Lover, You Should\u2019ve Come Over </em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Remus fell in love with Sirius when he was thirteen years old. He can remember the exact, ordinary moment. He was in Charms. Professor Flitwick had forcibly separated James and Sirius that year, thinking it would make a difference to their mischief. It hadn\u2019t. Instead, their jokes spanned two tables and eventually the entire room.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Next to him, James had been slumped at his desk. His glasses had slipped down his nose as he huffed out a breath in boredom. He and Sirius were brilliant, that was their problem. They mastered each spell while the rest of them still twisted the shape of Latin around their tongues.\u00a0</p>\n<p>That day, James had used his spare time to create a flock of paper birds. With a flick of his wrist, he had launched them at the back of an equally-bored Sirius\u2019s head. They pecked his ears and tangled in his hair.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Sirius had turned around. Remus remembers the way fragmented light had caught his smooth, straight nose and halo of long, dark locks. He\u2019d been laughing as he swatted at the birds, teeth white and pointed. It was a peek of the man he was to become. More than handsome. Dangerously beautiful.\u00a0</p>\n<p>In a sharp, sudden realisation, Remus\u2019s stomach had sunk. Swooped, like the birds around the room. Sirius\u2019s eyes had slid to him. They\u2019d looked at each other for a long moment. There was something foreign and tense inside Remus\u2019s body, not the wolf but <em> worse. </em>So much joy-hope-love that it hurt.</p>\n<p>Sirius\u2019s eyes had bubbled with laughter. His lips had curled into a subtle half-smile in the corner. He had raised a single, elegant eyebrow at Remus. A question. When he got no reply, Sirius had winked. Turned away. And Remus was <em> gone. </em><br><br>*\u00a0</p>\n<p>Now, Sirius stands at Remus\u2019s front door. It\u2019s snowing, the night blustery. His hair is sodden, bedraggled around his shoulders. His eyes are dark and tired. He has lost his playfulness, his mischief. They are twenty four years old and the world has taken laughter from them both.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cMoony,\u201d he says.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Remus flinches back. Sirius looks startled at the reaction. His voice. <em> His voice. </em> Remus has dreamed it so many times. Whispering dark, dirty promises in his ear. Shouting at him from across their flat. Saying, <em> I love you </em> until Remus couldn\u2019t bear to sleep from the fear of it.\u00a0</p>\n<p>His dreams had captured none of the nuance. Sirius\u2019s voice is rough. <em> From screaming in Azkaban, perhaps. </em>But it is deep and rich when he says Remus\u2019s childhood nickname like that and... Merlin, it is painful.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cCome in,\u201d Remus replies hastily, stepping back into the warmth of his home. He feels... fuck. He feels completely out of his depth. As much as he\u2019d <em> hoped</em>... he still can\u2019t say Sirius\u2019s name \u2013 can\u2019t stand the way it would curl in the air.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Sirius pauses and looks at him. Remus doesn\u2019t meet his gaze. Instead, he focuses somewhere in the vicinity of his chest. Someone has given Sirius their old clothes. They\u2019re loose around his shoulders, none of the fitted leather jackets or Rolling Stones tees he\u2019d worn to piss off his family. He is skinny, gaunt.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cRemus...\u201d Sirius sounds wrecked. His voice trails away and he takes a hesitant step forward, closer to the house.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou are...\u201d Remus fiddles with the sleeve of his sweater. \u201cYou are here to stay, aren\u2019t you?\u201d He hates that he is unsure. That he\u2019s small and <em> scared. </em>Sirius is a living Boggart he can\u2019t bear to banish. Instead he invites him in, politely, like they are strangers and not friends-pack-lovers-betrayers.\u00a0</p>\n<p>When they would fight \u2013 at Hogwarts and out of it \u2013 their friends were always there to hold them together. Tentative strings that interwound them, pulling them close. Tying them back.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Now there is no James to sling his arms around their shoulders and smirk through the awkwardness. No Lily to curl up against Remus in the library and tell him dirty jokes until he chuckled. No Peter to... no Peter. Instead it is emptiness and ghosts and all the unsaid things that lie in the valley between them.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Sirius steps properly into the house. His second-hand boots leave wet snow on the hardwood floor. His chest rises and falls. He is here, in the shoddy home Remus has carved out of the ruins of his life. He is here.<br><br>\u201cYes. Yes I would very much like to stay.\u201d<br><br>*\u00a0</p>\n<p>The kettle whistles on the hob. It\u2019s an old Muggle one from the charity shop, not one of those fancy Wizard kettles that brew themselves exactly when you need a cuppa.\u00a0<br><br>\u201cDo you want to talk about...\u201d Remus starts to say as he pours the boiling water. He feels braver with his back to Sirius. Like he can pretend he\u2019s talking to empty air. <em> Do you want to talk about it? Those years you were in prison, when I thought you were a traitor. Or the year you thought I was a traitor. Or our dead friends, or...\u00a0 </em></p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Sirius interrupts. \u201cIt all still feels like a bad dream.\u201d<br><br>\u201cMaybe Hogwarts was the dream,\u201d Remus replies. He turns back around and hands Sirius his tea. Their fingers brush, for the briefest moment. It burns. He sits down at the table, his own hands clutched around his teacup. Sirius is opposite him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Outside, the snowstorm rages. It is dark, the only hint of light from the lamp and candles Remus lit with a wave of his wand. Sirius had watched the movement with the same intensity he used to plan pranks.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He\u2019d been given his wand back, after the trial. It\u2019s the only belonging he has on him. All the rest, Remus knows, are sitting in the sealed and empty flat they had once lived. Or at Grimmauld Place. Or destroyed in the wreck of James and Lily\u2019s home. Remus has never been to any of those places, has never wanted to see another relic of Sirius Black again. Now there is one in front of him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSometimes, in Azkaban, I thought that was true. That Hogwarts was a dream. That I\u2019d been there for decades and gone mad with it,\u201d Sirius takes a sip of his tea. He looks haunted. \u201cThen I would transform into Padfoot and know it was real.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPadfoot did always have a way of simplifying things,\u201d Remus says.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He remembers, vividly, the moons they were together after the Prank. How the wolf took out its anger on Padfoot. How they nipped and bit and scratched and whimpered. How it was months before Padfoot submitted. How afterwards Sirius finally kissed Remus for the first time, fierce and angry in the early light of their dormitory.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d Sirius says simply. He seems to be remembering too. Then he looks up at Remus, whose eyes shift to a point behind Sirius\u2019s head. \u201cDumbledore told me that you have Harry.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI do.\u201d Remus takes a sip of his tea.<br><br>\u201cI won\u2019t be intruding, will I? I thought I could help. It can\u2019t be easy, looking after him by yourself afte\u2013\u201d Sirius cuts his sentence short.</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course you can,\u201d Remus replies. Of course, <em> of course </em>he\u2019s here for Harry. \u201cYou\u2019re his godfather, after all.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Remus gives Sirius his bedroom. The man looks like he is going to fall over. How long has it been since he\u2019s had a warm shower, a soft bed, a place that hasn\u2019t had every ounce of happiness sucked out?\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Sirius says awkwardly at the threshold of the bedroom. Young, brash Sirius had never been awkward. He had worn his emotions on his face. Had laughed joyously. Hated furiously. He has changed. Remus supposes he has too. \u201cWhere will you...?\u201d<br><br>\u201cOh, I\u2019ll bunk in with Harry,\u201d Remus replies. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t mind. He\u2019s a good kid.\u201d<br><br>\u201cYeah?\u201d Sirius seems hungry for any information on the child. A man only just able to swallow hope for the future. \u201cDumbledore said he looks a lot like...\u201d He stops, choked.</p>\n<p>\u201cJames, yes.\u201d Remus finishes. \u201cJames with Lily\u2019s eyes.\u201d\u00a0<br><br>There is a wave of grief. For the first time, Remus shares it with someone who <em> knows</em>. Who truly understands the hollow place where James and Lily should be. Their past, their loss. It is unimaginable to anybody but them.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cRemus...\u201d Sirius says eventually. He hasn\u2019t uttered <em> Moony </em> since the first time, when Remus flinched. \u201cWe\u2019ll talk in the morning, yeah? And I\u2019ll... I can meet Harry?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Remus swallows. It\u2019s all too much. They are strangers on the precipice. Known and unknown. Different and terrifyingly the same. Perhaps there are too many words to say and not enough time. Perhaps they have been broken too often. \u201cYeah okay.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Instead of sleep, Remus goes outside to smoke. He holds the letter Dumbledore sent this morning in one hand as the other drifts back and forth to his mouth, balancing the cigarette shakily between his fingers. He hasn\u2019t had time to read it yet. Now he knows what it will say.</p>\n<p>\n<em> Sirius has requested to stay with you and Harry. I have told him your location. I do hope that old wounds can now be put to rest.\u00a0 </em>\n</p>\n<p>He feels bitterly, bitterly angry. Has every moment in his life been perfectly orchestrated? Dumbledore, the conductor. He waves his wand and Remus is at Hogwarts. Then a soldier in war. Then alone. Then the guardian of his dead friends\u2019 child. Now this. Fuck.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Remus knew it would happen, of course he <em> knew </em>that he and Sirius would be reunited. He had wanted it, in fact. Had hoped for it desperately as he bled out on the floor under the light of the moon. But now the reality is here and it is much too soon.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He isn\u2019t prepared to look at the past. To try and give it some meaning, a purpose. No. Remus has stored it so neatly. Has clambered away from it with bloody hands. Has managed to stand on two feet and run, to hold Harry as he goes, only to be thrown back to the ground again.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He takes a drag of his cigarette. The smoke lingers in his throat. Remus blows it out in a breath. As he does, he whispers into the frozen night air like he is practicing the shape of the word so beautiful in his mouth...</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Sirius</em>.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Harry wakes early. The morning light streams from his window and gives his dark skin a soft, rich glow. His messy, black hair sticks in every direction, pressed against his pillow. He blinks slowly, yawns. Curls into Remus\u2019s chest.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cG\u2019morning Remy,\u201d he murmurs quietly.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Remus <em> aches</em>. He loves this child. Desperately. Has cultivated this home to keep him curious and innocent and free. But now the time of just the two of them is over. Remus is afraid their quiet existence will disappear. And Harry will too, like all pure things Remus has loved. He\u2019s so scared that he won\u2019t be able to hold on.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHarry,\u201d he says. \u201cLast night we had a visitor.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Harry tilts his head to look at Remus. His eyes are a bright, vivid green. In the morning, when the light hits them just so, he can see Lily in the common room by the fire. The flecks of gold that would reflect off her irises as they studied together.</p>\n<p>\u201cRemember your godfather, Sirius? He\u2019s come to stay with us.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIs he scary?\u201d Harry\u2019s voice is quiet. He clutches his soft rabbit toy and snuggles closer to him. They are surrounded by blankets, cushioned, protected. Outside, the air is eerily silent with fallen snow. As if their whole house is waiting.\u00a0</p>\n<p><em> Yes, </em> Remus wants to say. <em> He\u2019s fucking terrifying.\u00a0 </em></p>\n<p>\u201cNo Harry. He... he\u2019s so excited to meet you.\u201d<br><br>*</p>\n<p>They make breakfast. Harry has honey on toast. His small, sticky fingers leave prints on the table, his face, Remus\u2019s sweater. It seems they are holding their breath in anticipation for one man to walk in and disrupt the easy routine of it all.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Eventually, they hear the sound of feet on the stairs. Sirius thuds down, heavy. He\u2019s in the same clothes from last night. He looks less tired, his black hair tied in a messy bun at the top of his head.\u00a0</p>\n<p>When he spots Harry, he stops. For a moment, he wavers. Remus can see the panic in his eyes. The past pulls him back, like it once did for Remus. Its grasp can tear at reality and make even the smallest child your greatest fear.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHarry,\u201d Remus says softly. \u201cSay hello to Sirius.\u201d</p>\n<p>His voice pulls Sirius out of his silent terror. The man takes a step closer. His hands tremble at his sides as he scans Harry in wonder. Remus knows what a miracle it is, that this child exists. That there is a living, breathing, <em> laughing </em>future for James and Lily. He knows the enormity of joy and grief it contains.\u00a0</p>\n<p>For a long moment, Sirius and Harry stare at each other.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAll everyone... they were afraid,\u201d Harry says eventually. He is matter of fact. Slowly, he moves forward and reaches out to touch Sirius\u2019s hand. To make him real. Just like he once had for Remus. \u201cBut you\u2019re not so scary.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Once, Sirius would have been indignant. Would have stood tall, his leather jacket stretched across broad shoulders as he twirled his wand and smiled with dangerous eyes.</p>\n<p>Now, he softens. He curls inwards, towards Harry. His hair falls in front of his face as he looks down at the small boy with instant love.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Remus knows that Harry is curious and kind. He has endured a terrible home, accepted a werewolf as his guardian and joyously joined a brood of redheads. He cries as much as he laughs. He feels with his whole heart. He is the best of James and Lily. The <em> absolute best</em>. There is no way he won\u2019t love Sirius just as much as they had. It terrifies Remus to the core.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNo Harry,\u201d Sirius replies quietly. For the first time, his eyes are bright. \u201cI hope not.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"right\">This house<br>She's holding secrets<br>I got my change behind the bed<br>In a coffee can<br>Throw my nickels in<br>Just in case I have to leave<br><br>- Gregory Alan Isakov, <em> If I Go, I'm Goin </em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Somehow the house of two becomes an uneasy home of three.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Harry is enamoured by Sirius. As the man trudges around wearily and gives Remus tired looks, Harry is on his heels, silent but aware. He absorbs every word Sirius says, soaks up this new addition to their lives with an intrigued quirk of his head.\u00a0</p>\n<p>And Sirius responds beautifully. Even when the new wrinkles at the corner of his eyes stretch painfully, he is interested and engaged. Harry clambers all over him. Pulls his hair and throws snowballs at his back and pokes and prods with questions until he laughs. With Sirius, Harry is rough and tumble in a way that he never is with Remus.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Suddenly, Remus realises just how similar they are. Both Harry and Sirius have endured horrors only they can comprehend. Both crave joy, chase their fix of laughter. And even in the darkest of times they are able to hold happiness safely in their hands. To protect it, nurture it. They know how valuable it is.\u00a0</p>\n<p>But while joy thrives in the day, slow, quiet sadness fills the home at night. Suddenly Remus and Sirius are solitary people who drift around the empty home. There are simply spaces they cannot cross. Topics they refuse to enter, barred like closed doors and secret corridors.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Sirius is quiet, in the dark. Sometimes he is angry. His fists clench and he bites out words. He doesn\u2019t sleep much. Instead, he insists Remus take back his own bed and prefers to curl up on the sofa as Padfoot. Without Harry, they are two men who don\u2019t know how to speak anymore. Two people who cannot see the other, even as they try to squint at the blurry outline of what they had been.</p>\n<p>Sometimes when Remus lies awake and stares up at the ceiling, he can hear the yips and cries of a dog in distress. And then he\u2019ll hear the sound of Sirius\u2019s footsteps. And the kettle boiling. And then the clink of two, hopeful teacups. But Remus doesn\u2019t get out of bed. He lies still as the kettle whistles. And the second cup is put away. And the night continues on, each man alone with their fears.</p>\n<p>*\u00a0</p>\n<p>Conversations start and stop like this:</p>\n<p>Sirius has been home for less than a week. He tiptoes around the house but his presence soaks into the fabric of every room. One evening, Remus is slumped on the sofa. Harry has fallen asleep curled in his lap, but he can\u2019t bear to move him. Instead, he brushes his fingers through the child\u2019s hair. Back and forth. Back and forth. He remembers the way Lily would rock her baby to sleep. How James would run his thumb down Harry\u2019s tiny nose.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Remus hears a noise behind him and turns his head. Sheepishly, Sirius shuffles into the room. He\u2019s wearing joggers and a soft t-shirt. His hair is in a bun, whisps curled around his forehead. He hands Remus a cup of tea and looks down at Harry. The fire pops and crackles. Sirius breathes.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cEarl grey, splash of milk with one sugar, right?\u201d He says. His eyes move from Harry to Remus. They are grey and familiar. Sirius gives him a small smile.\u00a0</p>\n<p>And there is such a shock of lost routines and easy comforts that Remus has to swallow the burn of it. Late at night, when they first moved into Sirius\u2019s flat in London and Remus would lose himself curled up with a book, Sirius would bring him tea. Slide his hand down his arm, kiss his neck and draw him to bed. Away from fantasy and back into the warmth of their world.</p>\n<p>Sirius hovers for a beat, waiting, like he is expecting the intimacy they once had.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Remus doesn\u2019t say anything. Instead, he takes the tea and inclines his head. Looks back down at Harry. Away.</p>\n<p>Or:\u00a0</p>\n<p>Early one morning, when Remus wakes as the light only just begins to filter through the pale curtains and give his scars a soft glow. He gets up with a groan and stumbles out into the corridor... only to run into a shirtless Sirius still wet from the shower.\u00a0</p>\n<p>And Sirius <em> looks at him</em>. Because he\u2019s Sirius. And Remus can\u2019t catch his eye because it hurts too damn much to remember all the places that mouth has pressed. Instead, he looks to the floor. But not before he catches a glimpse of...</p>\n<p>\u201cYou have a new tattoo,\u201d he says dumbly. Two runes intertwined, solid on the top of his arm where they twist like the branches of a family tree.\u00a0</p>\n<p>And Sirius\u2019s face shutters closed as he steps back. \u201cYes,\u201d he replies.<br><br>Remus opens his mouth to say something \u2013\u00a0anything \u2013 apologise, maybe, for prying or apologise for not knowing this body anymore or fucking apologise for any of it. But Sirius keeps going.<br><br>\u201cJames and I got them... just before. During the war.\u201d He looks at Remus. His face is hard, angry. He bites out, \u201cyou would have known, if you\u2019d been there.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Or:\u00a0</p>\n<p>Late at night, when it is just the two of them at a safe distance by the fire. The silence is heavy and wary between them. They are strangers who share a room and a past and now a child. Remus reads a book as Sirius watches the flames.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI want to show Harry Padfoot,\u201d Sirius says. \u201cIs that okay?\u201d</p>\n<p>Remus glances up at him. \u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t that be okay?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t mentioned him yet. I wasn\u2019t sure.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Then the buried memory of the first time Sirius transformed hits Remus.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He remembers the angry, snarling almost-wolf backed into a corner who lashed out at his friends because he was scared, because the moon was rising in less than an hour and <em> why were they in the Shrieking Shack </em>and James\u2019s laugh at the astounded look Remus had given the shaggy black dog that had appeared in front of him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>And the tears that followed. And the fear and gratefulness and dread and love all wrapped in a display of devotion too big to put a name to except <em> pack.\u00a0 </em></p>\n<p>Now Remus looks back down at his book. Thinks. Hurts. \u201cHarry <em> has </em> been asking for a pet,\u201d he says, purposefully dismissive. Sirius flinches.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Or:\u00a0</p>\n<p>Harry and Sirius. Deliriously happy, they giggle together on the floor beneath the kitchen table as Remus steps into the room. He opens his mouth to say something, but neither of them have noticed him. Instead, he watches as Sirius gently pushes the boy\u2019s fringe out of his eyes. His hand is big on Harry\u2019s face. Harry leans into it. Remus makes a small noise and they both turn to look at him.</p>\n<p>Or:\u00a0</p>\n<p>Sirius asleep. Screaming.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Or:\u00a0</p>\n<p>Remus awake, peering into darkness. Hearing a dog pace around downstairs.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Or:\u00a0</p>\n<p>Long looks and half-words and no sudden movements and careful space between two bodies that have already mapped the landscape of each other.</p>\n<p><em> This is torture</em>, Remus thinks to himself as he makes breakfast for Harry and Sirius, as if it is any old morning. As if their friends aren\u2019t dead, <em> Harry\u2019s parents aren\u2019t dead</em>. Or Sirius has never been to Azkaban and Remus has never been alone. A dream. A new life.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Harry flings a cereal loop at Sirius, who catches it in his mouth and they laugh and laugh and laugh until Remus wants to cry.<em> I can\u2019t... I can\u2019t, I can\u2019t.\u00a0 </em></p>\n<p>*<br><br>Remus goes to visit Molly Weasley. He leaves Sirius alone with Harry for the first time and it terrifies him to the core. Like Harry will forget him. Or he\u2019ll be hurt or gone or <em> dead </em>like everything Remus has loved and taken his eyes away from.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Molly reaches out across the kitchen table and takes his shaky hand.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI can\u2019t do this,\u201d Remus admits painfully. It\u2019s an echo of when Harry had first lived with him. <em> I can\u2019t do this. I can\u2019t do this.\u00a0 </em></p>\n<p>\u201cYou can,\u201d Molly replies. \u201cAnd you will.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThis is worse,\u201d Remus says. He has to look away. Take a sip of his tea. It\u2019s horrible to say the truth of it. \u201cThis is worse than when he was gone. When... when he was in the past I could forget about it... I could pretend that...\u201d<br><br>\u201cBut Remus,\u201d Molly interrupts. \u201cWere you <em> happy? </em>\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t say anything. Outside, Arthur is playing with his kids. They\u2019re in the field around the Burrow, pelting each other with snow and laughing and little Ron is clinging to his father\u2019s leg as the twins taunt him and Percy is reading so intently that he fails to notice his older brother until snow is shoved down the back of his jacket.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He looks back at Molly. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d<br><br>Molly looks angry. Not at Remus though.<em>\u00a0</em>She is the one gentle thing that he can hold on to.<em>\u00a0</em>The one solid person that makes sense. \u201cThis is overwhelming. I understand. But James and Lily would want you to be happy. Both of you. All of you.\u201d<br><br>\u201cI don\u2019t know if I can be... I...\u201d He hates that he stutters.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou can. But now is the time to talk, Remus. Now is the time to live. Just talk to him, please.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>When Remus apparates back home, he pauses outside to have a smoke. It\u2019s dark, the only light shining from the antique lamp in the living room. Remus can see the window glow, like a warm, buttery welcome.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Harry must be in bed already. Remus wonders if the boy missed his goodnight kiss from Remus or if he hadn\u2019t even thought of it in the excitement of Sirius\u2019s stories. If Sirius knew how to stroke his hair back and trace the scar until his eyes fell shut.</p>\n<p>The air is so cold that it burns the back of Remus\u2019s throat when he inhales, but he savours the blissful pain of it and closes his eyes. Soon, Christmas will be upon them. Already the town is bustling with baubles and tinsel, hurried shoppers hustling up the high street to buy last minute gifts. He has bought Harry\u2019s already, with his own meagre money. A toy that Harry had been eyeing. A book for them to read together. And a photo of his parents, Sirius and Remus. They all smile in it.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cFilthy habit,\u201d a teasing voice says beside him. Sirius steps out the back door. His breath comes in balloons of frozen white air as he looks up at the stars. At the Canis Major. Back at Remus. He rubs his hands together.</p>\n<p>\u201cWant one?\u201d Remus asks, holding out the packet.<br><br>Sirius shakes his head. His dark hair is tucked behind his ears. \u201cNah, gave those up when Harry was born. Add a few years in Azkaban and the craving is truly gone...\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOh.\u201d There is a long silence. That Sirius can joke about prison like that... Remus takes another drag. He tries desperately not to think of stolen cigarettes behind the Herbology greenhouse. Of smoke shared between two mouths. Sirius had been the one to introduce him to the joy of it. He\u2019d taught all the Marauders how to smoke. How to exhale into shapes that danced around your head. He said it was <em>so</em> <em>fucking cool Moony.\u00a0</em></p>\n<p>Now, Sirius stares at Remus\u2019s hand where he holds the cigarette like it is poison. Then his eyes flick up to Remus\u2019s face. For a long moment, they look at each other. Remus breaks away. Back to the stars. Thinks about what Molly said, he <em> can\u2019t, he can\u2019t... </em></p>\n<p>But Sirius has always been the brave one. \u201cAre we ever going to talk about it?\u201d He asks eventually.</p>\n<p>\u201cAbout what?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cEverything. Fuck. Anything, Remus.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Remus takes another drag. His stomach sinks. He has spent years avoiding the horrible truth of it. Has fucked it away. Smoked it. The past was meant to stay there, but now Sirius Black stares him in the face and demands it unearthed. If anyone has the power, it is him. If anyone has the courage...</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy would we do a thing like that?\u201d Remus asks sardonically instead. <em>Fuck, fuck. </em><br><br>Sirius\u2019s hands clench. For a moment, Remus fucking <em>dares him </em>to have a go... but he lets out a breath. Unfurls. Sirius takes a step back and looks at Remus. He blinks slowly and his eyes seem to scan Remus like he is taking measurements for a new dress robe.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI spent years with those Dementors,\u201d Sirius says. His words are soft. \u201cEvery horrible, agonising moment of my past was replayed on repeat. Every dread amplified. I have lived that pain, in my mind, in my body. I know how real it is. But you know what seems even worse?\u201d He meets Remus\u2019s eyes. \u201cNot letting yourself feel it at all.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Remus grits his teeth and looks down. \u201cYou don\u2019t know what the fuck you\u2019re talking about.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t I?\u201d Sirius says. He rocks forward, closer to Remus. \u201cI <em> know </em> you. You like to think I don\u2019t, but I do. I know every fucking inch of you inside and out...\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd you still thought I was the traitor.\u201d It is despicable in the cold of the night.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThere you are,\u201d Sirius says, like he is relieved. Like he was waiting for it. Poking the wolf, wanting a reaction. But Remus can\u2019t... he can\u2019t give it to him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI miss James so fucking much.\u201d The pain seems to steal Sirius\u2019s breath, for a moment. \u201cHe was everything. And Lily. My family, you know? They were my family and I killed them. Don\u2019t you even <em> miss </em> them?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p><em> Don\u2019t you miss me?</em><br><br>\u201cI miss everything,\u201d Remus replies.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He wants to cry but he can\u2019t. If he cries, he will never stop. He could spend a lifetime crying for James and Lily. He could spend another crying for Peter. And for Sirius. For what they had and what they lost. When do you stop? Is it even possible?\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThey were my family too,\u201d he says. \u201cYou think you\u2019re the only one who loved them?\u201d He can\u2019t get his words out. They choke him. Like when he was told they were dead and Sirius a traitor. Bile spilling out his mouth. But now it\u2019s an angry, black cloud of twisted emotion.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Peter\u2019s mad confession reverberates in his mind. The wolf snarls. <em> Did any of you ever really love me? </em></p>\n<p>Sirius watches him with dark, hungry eyes. Remus knows what he wants. For him to scream. Scream and cry and yell and kiss him angrily like they used to fuck out all their arguments... but Remus is empty. He is empty of it all.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Instead, he lets out a heavily-restrained breath. He looks at Sirius, who is wild and bruised. \u201cAnd you didn\u2019t kill them,\u201d Remus adds for good measure as he stubs his cigarette out against the wall. \u201cSo stop saying you did. It doesn\u2019t absolve you.\u201d</p>\n<p>He throws the cigarette butt into the ashtray and slams back inside.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>As Remus lies in bed the next morning, he can see Peter\u2019s face. Round, rosy-cheeked, happy. In the quiet of the Hogwarts library, he would gently ask Remus for help. Call himself stupid. <em> You\u2019re not Petey, </em> Remus would say. <em> You just solve things differently to others.\u00a0 </em></p>\n<p>Now, all Remus can remember is his friend\u2019s snarled, angry face pressed red into prison bars. <em> How easy it was to convince them it was you. </em>Spitting. Scarred. Lashing out with bitterness and fear. Solving it the way he knew how... by unraveling the truths that kept them together.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Inside Remus is a monster. He knows that. It howls and scratches and yearns. When he was young, he thought that was all he was. A monster in boy\u2019s clothes. It took the Marauders \u2013 the group of people he loved most in this world \u2013 to show him that he was more than that. And to have that trust taken away...\u00a0</p>\n<p>Downstairs, Remus can hear Sirius make himself a cup of tea. The kettle boils. Sirius\u2019s feet patter softly on the wooden floor. Instead of listening to the familiar routine, Remus gets out of bed. He makes his way silently downstairs to hover at the kitchen door.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>Here, in the quiet hour when the Earth still holds her breath with the possibility of day, Sirius is extraordinarily beautiful. His tired eyes still have soft laughter lines that hint at mischief. His hair twists delicately around his cheekbones. He has gained happy, healthy weight. He is young and old.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Remus leans against the door. It creaks and Sirius turns. Freezes.</p>\n<p><em> I can\u2019t hate you, </em>Remus thinks. He simply can\u2019t hate Sirius. Not when he looks at him like that. But he can be angry. And bitter. And sad. Sirius probably feels the same. Moreso, perhaps, with the added darkness of Azkaban. Of seeing James and Lily dead. The betrayal of it all...\u00a0</p>\n<p><em> Just talk, </em>Molly Weasley had said. As if it were the simplest thing. And maybe it is. There are so many questions Remus has unanswered. So many hurts. If they had all talked before the war, maybe this could have been avoided. Maybe... but it doesn\u2019t do well to dwell on maybes. All he can do now is plunge his fingers into the wound left behind and dig the hurt out, just like he weeded the garden around his new home.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDid they...\u201d Remus pauses, hesitant. Sirius simply looks at him. He lets his arms drop to his sides as his grey eyes watch Remus carefully, hopefully. Still sore from the conversation last night. \u201cDid Prongs and Lily... did they think I was the traitor too?\u201d<br><br>There is silence. Outside, snow falls. The sun is a hint on the horizon, it catches on the windowsill and spreads orange obscenely across the kitchen. Sirius is steady but sad. Honesty, now. That is all they have left.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d Sirius says.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Remus replies, agonised, breathless. He didn\u2019t think there was a part of him left to break, but there <em>was</em>. Fuck, there was. \u201cOkay.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>It is a start.</p>\n<p align=\"right\">I'm sorry I haven't been myself<br>\nAnd something's got me down<br>\nWhat it is, I cannot tell<br>\nI won't be satisfied with anything I've earned<br>\nFear is just a part of love<br>\nAnd one thing I found<br>\nIs love is what you deserve<br>\n<br>\n- Briston Maroney, <em>Freakin' Out On the Interstate</em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Honesty comes in sentences pulled from the back of their throats. Involuntarily, like a howl to the moon.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Remus feels bruised. But it is not the wolf that has laid siege to his body this time. There are no claw marks to close, no salve that can be applied. Only more wounds, fresh. Picked at the scab until they bleed and bleed.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>He feels detached. He makes dinner. He plays with Harry. He escapes outside to smoke.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Sirius watches him, like a wretched ghost of a man. They are betrayer and betrayed, both of them. Is it worse that Remus believed Sirius had actually killed James and Lily or that Sirius ever thought Remus could? Perhaps they cancel each other out. Perhaps they are equally sinned and atoned. It doesn\u2019t feel like it.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Instead, in the dark of an evening when the clock ticks endlessly and the fire smokes and breaks, Remus traces the edge of his whiskey glass and watches the amber liquid dance with the reflection of the flames.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWas it the wolf thing?\u201d He asks.\u00a0</p>\n<p>And Sirius tilts his long neck up to look at him from where he sits on the floor by the fire. A dog, curious and cautious. His eyes are dark. His lips are wet with beer. He raises an eyebrow.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWas it the Black thing?\u201d Sirius replies.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>In the harsh snow-white of day, Remus has never seen Harry so excited. He hops around the house putting up garlands of orange and holly. He insists Remus play the Muggle radio so that Christmas music fills the home.</p>\n<p><em> He is James, </em> Remus thinks. <em> Like James with joy. </em>But then he can\u2019t. His black hair sticks up just like... his eyes exactly like... Oh, to feel angry at people he cannot be. It is hard to look at Harry. It is even harder to look at...</p>\n<p>Sirius\u2019s grin is sideways \u2013 <em> young \u2013 </em> as he levitates a small, patched tree from the forest into their living room. It bumps into the furniture. His eyes sparkle as he says <em> oops </em>with a look that says he isn\u2019t sorry at all. Harry screeches in delight and insists that he\u2019s put on Sirius\u2019s shoulders.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Together they fasten hastily transfigured decorations to drooped branches as Harry checks once again whether they\u2019re <em> sure Saint Nicholas will know where I am.\u00a0 </em></p>\n<p>\u201cYes Harry,\u201d Sirius says patiently as Harry tugs at his hair. Sirius growls and pretends to bite at his foot. Harry giggles and squirms, barely staying atop Sirius\u2019s shoulders.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cMr and Mrs Dursley said he didn\u2019t know about children in cupboards,\u201d Harry says. \u201cBut Ron said Saint Nicholas knows <em> everything.</em>..\u201d</p>\n<p>Remus swallows the lump in his throat. He looks down at the candles in his hands. When Harry was a baby, Remus remembers how Lily would make them dance around his crib so that he could follow the flames with his eyes. <em> Oh, if she was here... if she heard... </em></p>\n<p>Sirius pauses. \u201cHarry,\u201d he says with a disjointed tone. He takes a breath. \u201cHarry, Saint Nicky knows about you personally. I promise. That\u2019s how damn good a boy you\u2019ve been.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cReally?\u201d Harry peers over Sirius\u2019s shoulder to look at Remus. Remus smiles at him. It hurts.<br>\n<br>\n\u201cReally.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Later when Harry is in bed, Sirius and Remus hover in the kitchen. There is barely-light. White shapes on tired, shadowed faces. Sirius drinks beer and Remus washes the dishes, slowly. Then... honesty, again. Sharp.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you get him sooner?\u201d Sirius says.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Remus hunches forward. Closes his eyes.\u00a0</p>\n<p>It\u2019s a double-ended wand, that question. He didn\u2019t get Harry sooner because he couldn\u2019t. It hurt too much to think of the child. And when he did \u2013 between drinks and men and potions\u00a0and claws \u2013 Remus simply preferred the dream that Harry had a happy life compared to the stark reality that without James and Lily, it was destined to be an empty one.</p>\n<p>But that is not the question Sirius asks. No. And that is not the answer he wants either. <em> Why didn\u2019t you get me sooner.\u00a0 </em></p>\n<p>\u201cYou know why,\u201d Remus says blankly.\u00a0</p>\n<p>There is a long silence. He hears the thud of Sirius putting his beer down on the table firmly. The scrape of his chair.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIt seems that it must be very hard to feel sorry for someone else,\u201d Sirius says. His voice is rough, shaky. \u201c...when you\u2019re too busy feeling sorry for yourself.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>He slams out of the room. Remus scrubs the dishes, one by one.\u00a0</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>In the darkness of past-midnight, Remus tries to remember the last conversation he had with James. And with Lily. Had they laughed? Did he say that he loved them? Surely, in the middle of the war, Remus had made sure to say that he <em> loved them </em> every time he walked out the front door. Did they say it in return? He can\u2019t remember. He can\u2019t... he can\u2019t fucking remember.\u00a0</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Two days before Christmas, Sirius corners Remus in the hallway. His eyes look somewhere in the direction of Remus\u2019s ear. His mouth is a straight line. They haven\u2019t spoken since the last time. Each word feels too much like blame. Is this... is this their life now?\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI need to go to London,\u201d he says. \u201cThere is... a Christmas gift for Harry is there. At the apartment. I just... would that be okay?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWould it be...\u201d Remus is uncertain.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cTo go,\u201d Sirius finishes. \u201cJust to... pick up the gift.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>And Remus is shocked into a jumble of honesty. \u201cSirius... you do know that... you do know that you don\u2019t have to stay here, right? You can come and go as you... we\u2019re not. I\u2019m not... this isn\u2019t <em> prison...\u201d </em></p>\n<p>This whole time, Sirius skulking around the house. Late at night. Up at first light. Did he think he was trapped? <em> Too busy feeling sorry for myself</em>, Remus thinks.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Sirius scoffs, but his shoulders loosen. \u201cI <em> know </em>that.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Then he looks at Remus squarely in the face. Sees something, maybe, in the way Remus can\u2019t meet his eye. He repeats firmly, \u201cI know that, okay?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>\u201cHarry, put your boots on,\u201d Remus says later that afternoon, when Sirius is out of the house and it\u2019s just the two of them. \u201cWe\u2019re going to visit Neris.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry hurries and skips the entire walk. It\u2019s been... it\u2019s been entirely too long since any of them have been out of the house. Remus has already broken promises to himself and to Harry. Not to hide him away. Not to be outsiders. He wonders if there will ever be a time he doesn\u2019t feel like he is failing at this strange life.\u00a0</p>\n<p>On the way, Harry stomps in the snow and insists on holding Remus\u2019s hand. Remus looks down at him.<br>\n<br>\n\u201cHarry,\u201d he says. The boy has grown, already. How has he grown? When did he go from a small, scared thing hidden under a bed to this? Sirius\u2019s words ring in his ears. Has he not paid enough attention to him? \u201cAre you... you like Sirius, don\u2019t you?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Harry smiles. \u201cSirius is the bestest. And Padfoot.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cGood,\u201d Remus says distractedly. \u201cAnd you like... us all living together?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOh yes,\u201d Harry says. Then he pauses. Looks up at Remus uncertainly. \u201cIs that okay? Sirius is... he\u2019s pack too, right?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d Remus swallows. \u201cHe is pack.\u201d The words are heavy in the crisp air.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cGood,\u201d Harry replies.\u00a0</p>\n<p>When they reach Neris\u2019s house, it is covered in Christmas lights. A bright spark on the street. She greets them at the door with a smile, gives Harry a hug and lets him roam the house. It is covered in photos of family, fine china and ceramic ornaments of women dancing in beautiful dresses. Harry touches everything, gently.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s been a little while,\u201d Neris says as she pours Remus tea. \u201cYou\u2019ve been well?\u201d<br>\n<br>\nRemus smiles politely. \u201cYes, we\u2019ve been keeping quiet at home, with the... snow.\u201d<br>\n<br>\n\u201cOh yes,\u201d Neris says. \u201cTerrible out there.\u201d</p>\n<p>There is a long, awkward pause as Remus takes a sip of his tea. He crosses his legs. Uncrosses them. Crosses them again.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Neris leans forward. Puts her hand gently on Remus\u2019s knee. \u201cChild, I assume this isn\u2019t just a social call. As happy as I am to see Harry, there seems to be more on your mind.\u201d<br>\n<br>\nRemus sighs. \u201cI have... someone staying with us. An old... a friend from school. He\u2019s been through a lot. He... well he recently got out of prison. Not that he\u2019s dangerous! I mean... Merlin, I\u2019m fucking this up.\u201d<br>\n<br>\nNeris laughs. She raises an eyebrow. \u201cYou came all this way to tell me you have a gentleman caller at your house?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not like that! I mean... Sirius, is his name. He\u2019s been in the papers a bit lately...\u201d<br>\n<br>\n\u201c<em>Sirius Black</em>...\u201d Neris breathes. \u201cOh yes, we all heard about his escape. And then they had a closed trial, didn\u2019t they? Innocent, they said. After all that time. Dreadful, dreadful. Honestly...\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s been staying at my place. We\u2019ve kind of... we\u2019ve been hiding out there. But I don\u2019t want him to have to hide. For Harry to have to... I was hoping that you could, I don\u2019t know... spread the word?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Neris laughs again. \u201cAh, you\u2019ve come to start the gossip machine. I see you\u2019ve been talking to my granddaughter, Gemma. She\u2019s usually good at this sort of thing.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Remus looks down sheepishly. \u201cI was hoping we could go into town tomorrow. I just... I don\u2019t want to scare anyone.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNot to worry,\u201d Neris says briskly. \u201cI\u2019ll sort it out.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>The town is busy on Christmas Eve. Each shop is lit in brilliant rainbow colours. Beautiful yellow lights overhang the high street as if the stars have come down to say hello. And carolers sing on the corner. There is joy in the air, real joy. It\u2019s a stark contrast to silent evenings at home.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Harry holds Sirius\u2019s hand. Surrounded by the life and colour of the street, Sirius looks young. His hair is tucked behind his ears. He\u2019s neatened his stubble and is wearing a long black coat and scarf that wraps snugly around his neck. He is a far cry from the man in the paper, but that doesn\u2019t stop the townspeople from staring. When they walk past, people turn away. Or whisper to each other. But nobody is startled.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI should\u2019ve come as Padfoot,\u201d Sirius mutters. \u201cSafer. Easier.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThis is our home,\u201d Remus says firmly. Sirius looks sideways at him. There is something angrily fond in his eyes.</p>\n<p>\u201cThank you,\u201d he says.</p>\n<p>Harry pulls them in whichever direction he chooses. To the sweet shop, where he gets a free Christmas chocolate and the ladies coo over him while pointedly trying not to look at Sirius. To the charity shop where Harry runs up to Old Julian to see their new collection of scarves. While Harry makes his selection, Julian greets Remus and Sirius.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cBad, that business with the coppers,\u201d he says gruffly. \u201cGood to have you here, boy.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>And then Gemma and Neris, in the street. They\u2019re strolling together slowly, arm in arm. When they spot Remus, Sirius and Harry, they veer over. Gemma looks scandalously delighted.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, Remus Lupin has finally emerged. Who knew you\u2019d bring more drama to our little village than I ever could?\u201d Gemma grins, reaches down to tug at Harry\u2019s new scarf. \u201cHey kiddo.\u201d And then she looks up at Sirius. \u201cNo need for an introduction, Gran told me all about the new man in town. The paper did you no justice, you\u2019re <em> much </em> better looking in person.\u201d<br>\n<br>\nSirius raises an eyebrow as Remus hurriedly explains. \u201cThis is Gemma and Neris.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cPleased to meet you both,\u201d Sirius says politely.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Neris laughs, pats Sirius on the cheek with a mittened hand. \u201cOh no need to be so...\u201d<br>\n<br>\n\u201cSerious?\u201d Sirius smirks. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, that joke has been made plenty of times.\u201d And Remus has to stop himself from saying something ridiculous, like <em> fuck I\u2019ve missed it though. </em>Because he sounds like Sirius before war, when words weren\u2019t used as weapons, instead for the simple pleasure of making each other laugh.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Later, Harry spots some of the children he used to play with. They\u2019re making snowmen. Scrunching snow in their hands. Chasing each other. Harry looks at Remus and then back to the playground, but he doesn\u2019t say anything. Simply holds Sirius\u2019s hand tightly, unsure.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cGo on,\u201d Remus murmurs, giving him a nudge. Harry grins and runs to join them.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Sirius and Remus sit on a bench under a nearby tree. There are a group of mothers at the other end of the park. They look at Sirius warily, but don\u2019t approach. Remus reaches in his pocket and pulls out a cigarette from his pack.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI think I forgot,\u201d Sirius says suddenly. \u201cThat there\u2019s a world out here. Even before... Azkaban. During the war. I forgot there were still people who went about their ordinary lives.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWe all forgot,\u201d Remus says. He takes a drag of his cigarette. In the before, it didn\u2019t much seem like there would be an after. Only endless days of battle.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s a happy kid,\u201d Sirius murmurs. \u201cYou\u2019ve... you\u2019ve done a good job.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI didn\u2019t do anything, he did it on his own.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cRemus, I\u2019m trying to give you a bloody compliment here, okay?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Remus sighs. He looks down at the cigarette in his hand. The ash lands heavily in the snow. Sirius wrinkles his nose. The cold bubbles around them, the town bustles, the children laugh.\u00a0</p>\n<p>To Remus, it all still feels muted. These realities, these lives, they never stay. Remus knows better than anyone. Good fades. Until it is hollow and alone. He watches Harry fall backwards into the snow. Get up again.</p>\n<p>\u201cJames and Lily wouldn\u2019t have wanted him with me,\u201d Remus says. It is a bruise he hasn\u2019t pressed on enough yet, a pain he simply cannot heal. \u201cIf they didn\u2019t <em> trust </em>me... he, he should be with you.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Sirius, angry. \u201cHe is with me. And you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMaybe I shouldn\u2019t...\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t you fucking <em> dare...\u201d\u00a0 </em></p>\n<p>He can feel the moon rise in his bones. Sirius breathes, heavily.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t the wolf thing,\u201d Sirius says. He runs a hand through his hair. He looks at Remus steadily. \u201cI... It was so fucked up, during the war. You weren\u2019t there. And fuck, I\u2019m not saying that to... whatever, I\u2019m saying that because you don\u2019t understand what they were like, at the end. What we were all like. Afraid of our shadows. Doubting everything. Each other...\u201d<br>\n<br>\n\u201cThey didn\u2019t doubt <em> you</em>,\u201d Remus takes another drag of his cigarette.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cBecause I was there. Within their line of sight, most of the time. The only thing they trusted was what they could see with their own eyes. Fuck, most of the time you\u2019d come back and couldn\u2019t <em> look </em>at us.\u201d</p>\n<p>He pauses. \u201cI\u2019m... I\u2019m sorry, Remus. And I know... they would be sorry too. More than you can know. You\u2019re good with him, <em> you love </em>Harry. Don\u2019t give that up because of that fucking war. Don\u2019t you dare.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Sirius of the past would make a joke, right about now. Would bat his eyes and say <em> pretty please Moony. </em>But they are changed. The past is heavy on Remus too. It lays within his bones like the wolf. It tears just as angrily. It pulls with just as much hurt. He wishes he had the energy to grieve, still. Maybe that would get it out.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Remus chokes instead. \u201cFor...\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI know,\u201d Sirius says.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t the Black thing,\u201d Remus says.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI know,\u201d Sirius replies.\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"right\">Don't tell me the truth<br>\nTell me that it didn't happen<br>\nThere's been a mistake<br>\nThere's been a misunderstanding<br>\n<br>\n- Aidan Hawken, <em> Walking Blind </em>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Christmas breaks bright and early. Remus pads downstairs just as the sun rises. Already he can hear Harry and Sirius tear around the living room like nifflers on a hunt. He pauses by the door, catches the scene.</p>\n<p>They\u2019re in their pyjamas. Sirius looks so much like he did the first Christmas in their new flat, his face breathless with happiness. Then, it had only been the two of them. Sirius had bounced on his toes by their shoddy Christmas tree, dressed only in his pants and a Santa hat. He\u2019d said, <em> looks like Santa was good to you Moony. I think he deserves a kiss, </em>and Remus had fallen into him with a helpless laugh.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Now Sirius chases Harry yelling, <em> ho, ho, ho! </em>Harry laughs, shoves chocolate in his mouth. Bounces on the sofa and does a loop around the room. When Sirius spots Remus, his face settles into an expression Remus can\u2019t place. Happy-sad. Yesterday\u2019s apologies have gentled them.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He says, \u201cMerry Christmas, Moony.\u201d This time, Remus doesn\u2019t flinch at the childhood nickname.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cMerry Christmas,\u201d he replies.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Sirius is soft in the morning light. He smiles cautiously.</p>\n<p><em>J</em><em>ust give us a day</em>, Remus thinks. Then he stumbles awkwardly backwards, rocked by Harry who has launched straight into him. Harry jumps up and down, hugs Remus\u2019s legs.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cMerry Christmas Remy! Saint Nicholas was here. Sirius said he caught his bottom on fire. I think he was <em> lying. </em>Are we going to open presents? You have to open yours. And Sirius said we could have chocolate for breakfast. And then see Ron! And...\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Remus crouches down to wrap him in a proper hug. There are empty spaces around them, people who should be here and aren\u2019t. He breathes Harry in.<br>\n<br>\n\u201cPresents first?\u201d He suggests.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Together they sit by the tree. Its branches already wilt and droop, but Harry doesn\u2019t notice. Instead he pauses at the small pile of gifts.<br>\n<br>\n\u201cWhich one is mine?\u201d He asks.<br>\n<br>\nRemus and Sirius look at each other. Away.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThey\u2019re all yours,\u201d Remus says gently.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Harry turns wide eyes on them. \u201cWow. Thank you,\u201d he breathes.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Harry unwraps each present reverently. There are not many, not like other children. But he is incredibly grateful. His smile is brighter than the lights on the Christmas tree as he unwraps drawing pencils, a book, a toy and a few clothes. Harry clambers over to squish his nose against their faces. He laughs <em> thank you, thank you! </em></p>\n<p>When he opens Remus\u2019s special gift \u2013 he looks at him uncertainly. It\u2019s a photo album. The first half is filled with photos. Of his parents, when they were young. Him as a baby. Sirius throwing Harry in the air as James screeches. Lily asleep with Harry on her chest.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s your Mum and Dad, Harry,\u201d Remus says. Then he picks up the small camera that came with the gift. Molly had pressed it into his hands a few days ago. \u201cAnd this is for us to fill up the rest of the book. With new memories.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Harry touches the album, gently. He doesn\u2019t understand now, but he will. \u201cThank you, Remy,\u201d he says.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Remus doesn\u2019t look at Sirius. He can feel the man\u2019s eyes on the side of his neck, burned. He doesn't think of James and Lily, who trusted him until they didn't. Instead, he continues to hand out gifts. Harry has made each man a card, clumsily-heartfelt drawings with love hearts and Christmas decorations. Remus has to take a breath when he receives it. Tries to imprint the picture behind his eyelids.\u00a0</p>\n<p>For Sirius, Remus bought a second-hand leather jacket. It\u2019s soft and worn beneath his fingers. Sirius smiles and hands Remus his present. A sweater of warm, blue wool. Memories pass between them. Years unfinished.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Harry\u2019s final gift is from Sirius. It\u2019s clumsily-wrapped, awkwardly-shaped. Harry opens it and laughs in delight. Remus blinks, rapidly. It\u2019s the toy dog. The one that James had bought Harry as a joke, to tease Sirius. Fluffy, black and harmless. James had said, <em> it\u2019s you, Padfoot. </em> And Sirius had said, <em> fuck off I\u2019m much scarier </em>but insisted Harry sleep with it every night.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s from when you were a baby,\u201d Sirius says. \u201cYou left it at my house, once. Now I can give it back to you.\u201d<br>\n<br>\nHarry crushes the dog to his chest, says, \u201cNow I can take Padfoot everywhere.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>And Sirius says, \u201cYes, yes always, Harry.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>The Weasley house is overwhelmingly loud. Children scream and shout. Glass smashes to the ground. Baby Ginny cries. As they step out of the floo, a Quidditch ball flies past their faces. The twins throw it back and forth, clambering over furniture, knocking over ornaments.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Molly storms through, yelling, \u201cTake it outside boys! I said no balls in the house!\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Sirius leans over. \u201cDoes she mean us?\u201d He asks with a grin.<br>\n<br>\nRemus shushes him as Molly wraps Remus and Harry in a warm hug. She smells like Christmas cookies, a twitch of frantic magic and home. When she releases them, she rocks backwards to look at Sirius for the very first time. Her eyes travel up and down, they soften.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cMerry Christmas Molly,\u201d Sirius says. He awkwardly juts out the bottle of wine and homemade skincare Remus whipped up. Molly sweeps them into her arms and then Sirius, too.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cMerry Christmas, Sirius,\u201d she says with a catch in her voice. He looks slightly alarmed.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The noise starts up again and they are whisked away. Plied with wine and sat by the fire. Ron rushes Harry to the kitchen to show him the presents he received. <em>I got Bill\u2019s old broom! The one for kids,</em> he exclaims excitedly. Molly makes them promise not to fly it alone. Or in the house. The boys nod solemnly. Sirius gives them a cheeky wink as Remus raises an eyebrow.</p>\n<p>But the biggest surprise comes when Arthur hands Harry his present. It's wrapped in brown paper. One of the children has written HARRY in big sloping letters. Harry looks up at Arthur and Molly, whose faces shine with joy. He tentatively opens the gift to reveal a red sweater with the letter <em> H </em> stitched proudly. Harry immediately puts it on. His face is wide with a grin, he looks at Remus, teary.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re one of us now,\u201d Ron says.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWow,\u201d Harry manages to breathe.\u00a0</p>\n<p>As a child, Remus had barely been able to imagine friends. His family consisted of a distant father and a mother desperate to do her best. He was lonely, a lot. He was sad, a lot. And he knows he would be just as stunned as Harry to be surrounded by people who loved him enough to make him one of their own.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He leans down, smooths Harry\u2019s fringe off his forehead. \u201cSay thank you, Harry,\u201d he says.</p>\n<p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Harry whispers. Arthur ruffles his hair and Molly kisses him until Harry squirms away with a laugh and Ron says,\u00a0<em>gross Mum! </em>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Later, they sit around the table. It bustles with food and love. Sirius regales the twins with Marauder tales in a voice that hides any waver of tragedy. He smiles at Molly as she pushes another helping onto his plate. Gladly accepts more red wine from Arthur.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The children laugh with each other. Bill says, <em> wait you\u2019re saying that\u2019s </em> the <em> Harry Potter </em> until Arthur quietens him. Charlie shoves a carrot up Percy\u2019s nose that makes him cry. Harry and Ron play catch the peas<em>, </em> a competition that involves throwing green projectiles into each other\u2019s mouths. Molly sighs and says, <em> at least they\u2019re eating their vegetables </em>and Remus can\u2019t help but agree. He is warm with wine, soft with Christmas cheer.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Sirius watches him across the table. He watches Sirius.\u00a0</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>When they get home, they slump onto the sofa. Even Harry can\u2019t seem to move, only roll around the floor saying <em> I\u2019m stuffed, Siri. I\u2019m gonna explode! </em> He picks at leftover chocolates and gives them a swipe with his tongue. When he realises he may <em> actually </em>explode, Harry sadly puts them back in the tray. Remus makes a note of which ones have been covered in kid saliva with a reminder to feed them to Sirius later.\u00a0</p>\n<p>In the meantime, Sirius somehow manages to sniff out a stash of tequila hidden in the kitchen cupboard. He raises his eyebrow at Remus and gestures with the bottle, <em> you want some? </em> Remus nods in reply.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Together, the three of them sit by the fire. Harry wraps himself up between Remus and Sirius. He has the photo album in his lap and flips through it like a storybook. Harry asks yawning questions like, <em> was my mum a princess? </em> To which Sirius snorts and Remus says <em> oh yes of course. </em> And <em> what did he sound like? </em> To which Sirius says, <em> exactly like you.\u00a0 </em></p>\n<p>And as they drink and reminisce and Harry\u2019s eyes begin to droop, Sirius gets quieter. And his expression slips. And he pours more tequila. And his breath shallows. <em>What goes up must come down, </em> Remus thinks. <em> \u00a0 </em></p>\n<p>Harry eventually crashes into a chocolate-induced sleep. When Remus puts him to bed, he smiles. His Weasley sweater is still stained with Christmas lunch and his arms wrap around the toy dog that Sirius returned to him. Remus kisses his hair, traces the lightning scar that cracks through his forehead.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cMerry Christmas, Harry,\u201d Remus whispers. Sopped with tequila and memories, the words sound a lot like, <em> I love you.\u00a0 </em></p>\n<p>When he makes his way back downstairs, Sirius is slumped. He has tequila in one hand and the photo album in the other. He brings the bottle up to his downturned lips. His profile carves a curved silhouette. Hunched, ached.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSirius,\u201d Remus murmurs as he enters the room. He crouches down on the floor in front of him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Sirius\u2019s eyes are wet and furious. He doesn\u2019t meet Remus\u2019s gaze. Instead he watches the photographs. Lily and James smile, obscenely-alive in each frame. Vibrant. So <em> young </em> that it is revolting they ever spent a minute wasting it on war.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t fucking fair,\u201d he says. He throws down the album.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI know,\u201d Remus replies.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Sirius\u2019s fist clenches. His nails bite half-moon crescents into his palm. Remus touches each knuckle, gently.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHe would\u2019ve...\u201d Sirius is too angry to speak. \u201cHe would\u2019ve fucking <em> adored </em>today. He would\u2019ve... it should be him. It should be him!\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>He is despair, personified. Sirius\u2019s eyes are endless, hollow pools when he finally <em> looks. </em>He is emptied out of every ounce of joy and laughter. Used it up, for Harry. Smiled it out, for Molly. Remus doesn\u2019t dare breathe.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Here, with each other. They can be nothing. It\u2019s what they have left, isn\u2019t it? Dead friends. A dead relationship. Dead memories. They look at each other. And look.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI know,\u201d Remus whispers. It should\u2019ve. It fucking should have. Remus and Sirius both know, they should be dead and Lily and James should be alive. The two of them would have made it. Would know what to do, how to continue, how to breathe.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you remember,\u201d Sirius says. \u201cDo you remember our first Christmas? At Hogwarts.\u201d He takes another swig of tequila. \u201cJamie stayed because my parents decided I needed to be punished that year. Cause, Gryffindor. He... he <em> stayed</em>. And you stayed because of the moon, and... and...\u201d<br>\n<br>\n\u201cAnd Peter stayed, because he didn\u2019t want to be left out,\u201d Remus continues for him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThat rat bastard,\u201d Sirius says viciously. \u201cBut we ate so much food. And found so many tunnels. Planned pranks. And we laughed. We spent the entire holiday laughing. Fuck, it was one of the greatest Christmases I ever had.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sirius sucks in a breath. Memories are visceral, Remus knows that. He can see James. The way his smile lit up an entire dormitory. And his joy was contiguous, infectious. That Christmas, he had forcibly dragged every lonely child into the courtyard for <em> the greatest snowball fight Hogwarts has ever seen</em>. It lasted for three days. Remus had seen the Professors placing bets.\u00a0</p>\n<p>And James... well, James was Sirius\u2019s person from that moment on. Remus knows this as certainly as he knows the moon will rise. They were more than brothers. Soulmates, sentences unspoken. Remus and Lily would share wry smiles and winks. Would joke, <em> why don\u2019t you just marry each other then, </em>and Sirius would swoon into James arms and they would pretend to snog with loud-wet sounds.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIn Azkaban,\u201d Sirius says, shaking his head. \u201cThe Dementors... they take every good thing. They take it all. What if I...? I can\u2019t forget him, Remus. I can\u2019t... <em> don\u2019t let me</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>He lets Sirius curl into him. He tucks his hair behind his ears and takes the tequila bottle out of his hand. Sirius shudders.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou won\u2019t,\u201d Remus whispers. \u201cYou could never.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI miss him,\u201d Sirius says.<br>\n<br>\n\u201cI know,\u201d Remus replies.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd her,\u201d Sirius says.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d Remus replies.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd you.\"</p>\n<p>Sirius falls asleep on the couch. His lips still smell of tequila when Remus pulls a blanket up under his chin. He imagines James, standing with his arms crossed next to him and joking with a crooked smile, <em> the drunken lush, aren\u2019t you going to kiss him better, Moony? </em> And Remus would elbow him and say <em> do it your bloody self</em>.</p>\n<p align=\"right\">My friend is gone, he ran away<br>I can tell you, I love him each day<br>Though we have sparred, wrestled and raged<br>I can tell you I love him each day<br><br>- Sufjan Stevens, <em>The</em> <em>Predatory Wasp of The Palisades Is Out To Get Us\u00a0</em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The space between Christmas and New Year is slipperier than melted snow. Days stretch and retract. They slide from one to the other, content. Gentled, heavy with leftovers.\u00a0</p>\n<p>After the great tequila confession that we <em>need not speak about Remus</em>, a secret corridor opens between the two men. They funnel memories surreptitiously, cautiously. They put down the ghost of their pain, if only for a day or two. They let it rest.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Instead Sirius smiles when he talks about James. Remus tries to smile with him. When he can\u2019t, he reminisces. <em> Do you remember how James snored? </em>He describes the sound,\u00a0<em>a hoot, a snort, a honk</em> until Sirius laughs with tears. A piece inside Remus quakes and breaks back into place. It is enough.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Sirius touches him more. Remus wishes he didn\u2019t notice but he <em>does.</em> Wishes his body wasn\u2019t so tuned to the gentle fingers that brush his shoulder. Or the toes that touch his shin beneath the kitchen table when Harry says something they\u2019re not meant to laugh at. They circle the intimacy they used to occupy. Remus retreats each time.<em>\u00a0</em></p>\n<p>On New Year\u2019s Eve, Sirius insists they have a party. <em>A new start for all of us, </em>he says. His eyes ache and hope in equal measure. The three of them wear pointed party hats. They put up decorations and pour wine. Harry takes to counting down at random intervals throughout the night, bounding in happiness. Each time he reaches one, they cheer.\u00a0</p>\n<p>When the clock finally turns over to midnight, Harry is curled on the sofa. He sleeps peacefully into their new beginning. His chest rises and falls. They follow each breath, five, four, three, two... and raise their glasses in a silent celebration. They watch each other.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHappy New Year Moony,\u201d Sirius murmurs. His eyes are dark. Lips stained red with wine.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHappy New Year,\u201d Remus swallows.\u00a0</p>\n<p>For the first time, Remus thinks about the future. Another year of this. And as much as he tries not to \u2013 he thinks, <em> yes. </em>Yes I could do this one more year. Yes, I could make something of this shoddy mess. This broken and patched existence. Maybe, maybe...\u00a0</p>\n<p>But as always, the moon approaches. Remus can feel it drag his bones to a shudder and halt. His body twists. His spine aches. Really, he should be used to the way it wrenches him from himself. A sick, moon-led puppet.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He isn\u2019t.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Sirius avoids Remus when he is Padfoot. Slinks out of the room. Distracts, yips and nips at Harry. If they startle upon each other, his grey eyes turn away. His ears flatten back. He sinks belly-low to the floor.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Human-Remus feels the same. It hurts to look at Padfoot. He is a creature of childhood. Blissfully, angrily pack. If he could, he would lay on the floor too. Supplicate, humbly. Say, <em>sorry for all the hurt we've caused each other as humans. </em>\u00a0</p>\n<p>But the wolf inside Remus yearns and hates in equal measure. It is angry. And Sirius can feel it. How sick with need the wolf is. For stag, rat and dog. For child. They are so close to the surface. Sunken into Remus's skin. Entwined in him. He knows that this moon will be a bad one. But still \u2013</p>\n<p>\u201cYou will go with Harry,\u201d he says with false-calm to Sirius. \u201cAnd spend the night with the Weasleys. This isn\u2019t up for negotiation.\u201d</p>\n<p>Now Sirius has none of the submission he has as Padfoot. He is furious, fierce. It\u2019s an argument they\u2019ve had every day leading up to the moon. \u201cYou don\u2019t just get to <em> decide...\u201d </em></p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d Remus says, hard. \u201cYes I do.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Sirius runs an angry hand through his hair. He snarls, \u201cI thought we were equals here.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Angry words catch on his teeth. Remus chokes them back. \u201cNot about this.\u201d His jaw clenches. \u201cI will not...\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAccept help? Instead you\u2019ll tear yourself up alone. Such a fucking <em> martyr.</em>\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI will not risk you! Or Harry!\u201d Remus stumbles backwards, takes a breath. In the other room, Harry plays obliviously with toys. Remus will not subject him to another argument. He lowers his voice, whispers angrily, \u201cWhat do you think the wolf will do Sirius? I have been alone for so many moons. Even before...\u201d</p>\n<p>He stops himself. <em> Even before you were gone, </em> hangs in the air between them. During the war there had been endless lonely moons. Endless agonising ones. At one point, Remus realised that James, Lily, Peter and even Sirius had forgotten to track them. They would look shocked, when Remus returned. Shocked and \u2013 what Remus now recognises \u2013 suspicious.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Sirius raises his eyes. Traces the scars that stretch across Remus\u2019s face. Throat. Arms. He is an assembled, mangled body of mistakes. Remus can sometimes hardly believe he ever let Sirius touch it.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cPadfoot can help...\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPadfoot can\u2019t <em> look at me. </em> And you think the wolf will be <em> overjoyed </em> to see you either? No. He\u2019ll kill you. Like he tries to kill me. If anything happened to you, Sirius. I couldn\u2019t...\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Sirius is quiet. \u201cI don\u2019t agree,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t think you would hurt me. I think you are <em> better </em>with Padfoot. Don\u2019t you want to try?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThink of Harry,\u201d Remus says. \u201cHe needs one of us. Please.\u201d He sags. Then asks again, the only thing he can ask of Sirius. \u201cPlease.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Sirius watches him. His mouth holds unhappy so beautifully. \u201cFine,\u201d he says.\u00a0</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>For days, the wolf paces like a shadow between them. Sirius tries to match its stride. He can\u2019t keep up.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>At nearly-full, Remus sneaks outside with his pack of cigarettes. He watches the stars, can feel the earth rotate as he barely holds onto the surface. It\u2019s comical, really. How much the moon must have seen. How small and scared and insignificant they must all look. His hand traces across the layers of spells that arch over their home. The protections he has put in place to keep his family safe. It doesn't feel like enough, anymore. What do you do when the monster is inside?</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you out here being bloody morbid again?\u201d He hears Sirius ask behind him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Remus hums. He inhales and exhales. \u201cOnly a bit.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Sirius joins him in the garden. He leans back on the wall and digs his toe into the sogged ground, kicks a rock with his shoe. The snow has dripped away to reveal the undergrowth. Come spring, they will plant again. Grow once more.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou don\u2019t smile as much as you used to,\u201d Sirius says suddenly. An abrupt, brutal conversation starter. Around him, his hair tangles in the night air. The bright end of Remus\u2019s cigarette is a spark in the cold.<br><br>\u201cDon\u2019t I?\u201d Remus asks.<br><br>\u201cNo. Sometimes I think you will. But then you stop short, like you don\u2019t remember how.\u201d Sirius scrubs a hand across his face. \u201cI really thought... I don\u2019t know, it\u2019s stupid.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Remus looks up. Sirius watches him with furrowed brows, but when their eyes catch he skitters away. The moon glows eerily on his face. It is unnatural on him. He should never be cast in its bleak light.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhen I heard you had Harry, I had this fantasy I think. During my trial. Of you, happy out here. But you haven\u2019t been, have you?\u201d\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>Remus wants to say something ugly. Like, <em> how could you ever think I\u2019d be fucking happy? </em> Or <em> are you really that naive? </em>But he can\u2019t. Every day Sirius trudges towards the raw insides of Remus. Soon he will open him up and gaze in disgust at the blackened, empty spaces left behind.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIt hasn\u2019t been easy,\u201d Remus replies blankly instead.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWas there...\u201d Sirius pauses for a moment, then plows ahead. \u201cDid you have someone?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Remus takes a drag of his cigarette.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve had many people,\u201d he says. There is an object in his chest he can barely move around. It hurts to speak.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Sirius flinches back. Exhales. \u201cNobody, then.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Remus looks at him. \u201cSirius...\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re so close to being you again. With Harry. The old you. Not the war one. Except for your smile.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Fucking hell</em>,\u201d Remus replies.</p>\n<p>The cigarette burns to ash in his fingers, Remus throws it to the ground with a hiss. In the dark, Sirius is curved. His neck soft and vulnerable under the moon. Remus can see his breath crystalise in the air. His hands twitch at his sides. They\u2019re on the precipice. Both of them balanced wobbly, neither wanting to fall.</p>\n<p>\u201cI promised you, when we first...\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d Remus interrupts. He remembers the exact words. Sirius had kissed him. They were so fucking young. And Remus had yelled, <em> you can\u2019t fucking do that, when you leave... when you... </em> And Sirius had kissed him again. Hard. <em> You won\u2019t ever be alone Moony, I promise you.\u00a0 </em></p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry you were the last of us left,\u201d Sirius says. \u201cBut you don\u2019t have to be afraid anymore.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Remus closes his eyes.\u00a0</p>\n<p>During the war, he was secretive. He hid the festered, ugly, animal parts of himself. He even began to enjoy the wild-freedom of a werewolf full moon. When he ran with vicious packs. When they bit and ravaged each other. Even when... no, he had not enjoyed Greyback.</p>\n<p>But Sirius still doesn\u2019t understand who he became. Will never understand. Remus had told him, <em> I won\u2019t let war change us, </em>when he knew he was already changed. Then they were gone, and with them the boy Remus had been. He'd thought, <em>that's what I deserve for thinking I could keep them</em>. Now there are too many things that can be taken away. He won't let them.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWe've all made promises we couldn\u2019t keep,\u201d Remus replies.</p>\n<p>\"Please,\" Sirius says in a sick imitation of their argument. \"Let me be there.\"</p>\n<p>A pause. \"I'm sorry,\" Remus says.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Sirius smiles a small, defeated smile. He wouldn't be him, if he didn't have one last stab at it. Now he turns to go back inside. Says, \u201cDon\u2019t stay out here being miserable too long.\u201d</p>\n<p>Remus lets his eyes follow the slope of Sirius\u2019s back in an old black sweater. His knobbly wrists. He says, \u201cSirius?\u201d And the man turns back around. His grey eyes, distant. Tequila, a memory between them.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI miss you too.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>The next morning, Remus can\u2019t get up. His chest is leaden. Even soft, winter light is too bright. A hand has dissected him and left him exposed, his guts spilled on the ground. He is numb.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d Sirius says in understanding. He\u2019s been summoned by Harry, who scampered to him when he failed to rouse Remus from bed. \u201cOh, Moony.\u201d His voice is gentle. It has been a long time since Remus heard it like that. If he had energy, he would sob.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Instead Remus turns away. His body curls. His intestines knot inside him. His bones crack and reform. His teeth grow, snap back. Shift and pull. Harry crawls into bed behind him. His tiny fingers trace soothing, incomprehensible patterns along Remus\u2019s spine.</p>\n<p>Sirius leaves, then returns with tea. The air smells of chamomile. In his heightened state he can almost taste old-pack and he aches with want. A wide palm brushes his forehead. The soft hum of transformation. Padfoot at his feet.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He feels only moon. Only beast. And this time he allows himself to succumb, lost in the agony of pre-transformation. He disappears into pain. Savours it, relentlessly. Welcomes it. Despises it.\u00a0</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>When it is time to go, Harry cries. It is a miracle Remus can hold himself up to watch them depart. He leans heavy on the furniture. If even a feather landed on him, he would simply sink to the ground. Watching Harry sob, he wants to anyway.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cPlease don't,\u201d Sirius says to Harry. Tries to hush and soothe his crying. It\u2019s the first time he has witnessed a proper tantrum. Harry struggles in his arms. Tries to leap towards Remus. Every time he does, Sirius\u2019s eyes harden. His mouth is straight and accusatory. <em> Look at what you\u2019re doing to us.\u00a0</em></p>\n<p>Remus steps closer. \u201cI will be okay, Harry,\u201d he tries to reassure.</p>\n<p>Harry cries harder.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cLook at me,\u201d Remus is firm. \u201cLook at me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry\u2019s eyes meet his. They are swollen and red. His irises are a deep, vivid green washed with tears. His breath shudders, stutters.\u00a0<em>Oh,\u00a0</em>Remus thinks. <em>You and I are full of the same fear.\u00a0\u00a0</em></p>\n<p>Instead he asks, \u201cHave I ever lied to you?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Harry murmurs.</p>\n<p>\u201cThen hear me now. Sirius will take care of you. Ron is waiting, like every month. And you will see me tomorrow. I promise.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Harry reaches out again and this time Remus lets him wrap his arms around his neck and bury his nose in Remus\u2019s hair. His face is wet. He smells of strawberry shampoo, the damp-dog of Sirius and home. In there is the memory of Lily and James. Sirius watches.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cGo on,\u201d Remus says. It breaks his heart.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Harry turns away. Calmer now, he presses his face to Sirius\u2019s. Their black hair intermingles and Remus thinks <em>my pack.\u00a0 </em></p>\n<p>At the hearth, Sirius pauses. He turns. His eyes trace Remus desperately, angrily. He opens his mouth. Then closes it again. They have both begged enough. Both pleaded too much. Definitively, Sirius scoops some floo powder into his hand and throws it to the ground. A flash of green surrounds the pair.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThe Burrow,\u201d Sirius bites.\u00a0</p>\n<p>And Remus is alone to face the moon.\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"right\">I'm a bad liar<br>\nWith a savior complex<br>\nAll the skeletons you hide<br>\nShow me yours, and I'll show you mine</p>\n<p align=\"right\">- Phoebe Bridgers, <em> Savior Complex </em> <em> \u00a0 </em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Remus wakes to the thick, metallic smell of blood. It slides slick and slowly from his body. Deep claw marks have wrenched his skin open. The edges flap bare in the cold air of the bunker. His arms are mangled and twisted around him. His legs gnawed to the bone. He can feel his belly exposed to the elements, the way his transformed insides twist and turn back into shape. His eyes are crusted shut with black blood. Every broken patch of him hurts. But he is alive. That is enough for now. He lets himself fall back into darkness.\u00a0</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>When he wakes again, his arms have snapped into place and the flesh on his body aches a raw pink new. Blood has congealed and the stitch of fresh skin already itches. He sits up. Inside, the wolf paces angry and fierce. It is not done with him yet. <em> Where is pack</em>, it asks over and over. <em> Where is pack? </em></p>\n<p><em> Pack is safe</em>, Remus thinks angrily in return. <em> Away from you. </em> And the wolf howls because it can <em> smell </em>pack somewhere, close, why won\u2019t you let me... And so Remus deliberately breaks a finger, the sharp sudden pain of it interrupting any thought.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Young Remus would have quaked in the face of such an animalistic display. He had cried over every split lip. Queasied at the sight of blood. Frankly, he had been terrified of the monster inside him. But this Remus, who has killed before he could be killed, who has run under the moon, who has bitten, who has fought, who has fucked, who has forgotten... this one knows that the horror of the wolf and the man are the same.\u00a0</p>\n<p>In fifth year, Sirius (<em>pack pack pack</em>, the wolf howls) led Snape into a dismal tunnel under Hogwarts and the wolf had chased the smell of meat. When Remus had woken in the Hospital Wing it had been with sick, blood and fear in his nostrils, desperation and blind hunger.\u00a0</p>\n<p>And he had understood that he was no better than the wolf, because in him were the same dark, twisted parts that hated Snape with an equal fury. Who wanted him hurt for the torment he inflicted. Who wanted him scared. Perhaps Peter had been the only one to see the truth of the matter, that inside him was an animal to be used and so he had and it had <em> worked</em>.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Now, he feels the wolf bite. Throw itself against his ribcage. Remus snarls in return. As long as he is more... more angry, more stubborn, more animal, more... then the wolf will settle until the moon sets it free once more.\u00a0</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>When the battle within him has raged its last, tired howl, Remus lets himself free. He crawls out of the trapdoor hidden in the thick of the forest and slumps onto the melted, snow-covered floor.\u00a0</p>\n<p>For a moment, he rests. He watches the way the sun arches across the sky, it\u2019s shy beams bounding through the treetops. Every day it rotates, endless and relentless in its mission to drive away darkness. If Remus dreads and fears the moon, then the sun is a welcome refuge that illuminates all the dark places inside him. Already he can feel how each golden spark licks across the new scars on his face. How they twist and curl, owned by the mark of the wolf.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He could lay here forever, if he wanted. Let the forest floor cover his body, take it back home. Before, he used to. Would ache in silence as he looked at the sky for hours until some hidden urge forced him in search of water. Now he thinks, <em> Harry. </em> Harry. Merlin, beautiful Harry. It is the same moment he wrestles with every month. And every month it is the same answer. This time it is, <em> Harry and Sirius.\u00a0 </em></p>\n<p>Slowly, he crawls back to the house. He leverages himself up to push against the front door until it creaks open with a long groan. His wand is on the hallway table next to neatly folded clothes. He picks it up and traces the worst of his injuries, muttering well-practiced spells. Just to close them. Just so he can stand.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He puts his clothes back on. It feels like a mockery, to dress. To hide the animal with a big sweater and frayed trousers. As if he is human and soft. Now, <em> now </em>would be when he would usually apparate to the dark confines of a werewolf clan. And he\u2019d let another animal take all the pretense away again.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Instead, he hobbles to the fireplace and gingerly floos to the Weasley\u2019s home. There, the fire crackles warm and inviting. He can hear children laughing. He can smell the faint spark of magic that lingers in the air, tea and scones in the oven. It is another world, another life.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cRemus?\u201d he hears.\u00a0</p>\n<p>On the sofa are Sirius and Harry. Harry looks tired. So does Sirius. His face is drawn, pale. His hair hangs loosely around his shoulders. Their eyes reflect the flames back at him, and the tall shadow of man-Remus that has stepped into their lives once more.</p>\n<p>He forces a smile onto his face. He knows his teeth are bloody. \u201cSee?\u201d he says, splays his arms open wide as if to say, <em> I\u2019m totally fine. </em>Blood trails towards the sleeves of his sweater, he can feel the rivulets curve and descend down his forearm. His face stings.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Sirius does not look reassured. Instead, he is angry. \u201cYes, I see,\u201d he says with gritted teeth. Harry looks between the two men, his chin wobbles. Sirius takes his hand.<br>\n<br>\n\u201cC\u2019mon, let\u2019s go play outside while Remus properly cleans up,\u201d he says. They leave without a backward glance. Remus slumps. Too human, once more. Not human enough.\u00a0</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Later that night, Harry dozes against Remus\u2019s chest in front of the fire. His head is tucked under Remus\u2019s chin, his socked feet pressed under his legs. Sleepily, the boy reaches up to trace the new scar that curls on Remus\u2019s forehead.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cLike mine,\u201d Harry says. Remus smiles down at him. He runs his thumb along the lightning bolt scar. Harry closes his eyes and drifts into a sleep free from monsters that haunt those who know the world.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not, you know,\u201d Sirius says quietly from the doorway. His mouth is still stubborn and furious. His grey eyes burn. Remus has to look away. \u201cHis scar is born of sacrifice and hope and... and love. Yours are...\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI know,\u201d Remus says quietly. His are animal and hatred and fear.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy won\u2019t you let me... <em>anyone...</em>\u201d Sirius begins.<br>\n<br>\nRemus tiredly closes his eyes. He is young but his body is exhausted. Each bone is broken and cracked. Each piece of flesh stitched and replaced too many times. Is there any of the old Remus left?\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNot tonight Sirius,\u201d he says. \u201cNot tonight.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>*<br>\n<br>\nAnd so it continues every month. Remus sends Sirius and Harry away. Sirius is angry. He bellows and argues and stomps and sulks. When that doesn\u2019t work, he forces Padfoot onto him. Bounds and barks and curls up against Remus\u2019s thigh late at night. A grim companion. A reminder. <em> See, </em> the dog\u2019s eyes tell him imploringly. <em> Pack. See.\u00a0 </em></p>\n<p>January turns to February turns to March. Harry flourishes under two pairs of watchful eyes. They teach him the curved shape of letters and all you can say with them, the sharp order of numbers and how they organise the world. At the Weasleys, he learns to share and play and imagine. Each week he bounces home with excited ramblings about all he has discovered.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s a nerd like <em> you,</em>\u201d Sirius says with a smirk at the corner of his upturned mouth.</p>\n<p>Remus runs his hand through Harry\u2019s messy hair. \u201cNo. He\u2019s like Lily.\u201d</p>\n<p>On Wednesdays they take him to a Muggle playgroup at the park. Sirius charms all the mothers whilst Remus hides behind a tree with a cigarette in his hand. He fools neither Sirius nor the women that surround him. Instead he lets the smoke twist in his mouth as he watches Harry learn how to curb the accidental magic that sparks out of him. As he watches Harry understand that his magic makes him no better or worse than any other child.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Occasionally they go to the pub. Remus pretends not to notice how Sirius presses his leg against Remus\u2019s in the booth. The arm slung around his shoulders. Or his hand on Remus\u2019s thigh, tapping to get out and order another drink. When Gemma joins them, she raises an eyebrow as Sirius slinks towards the bar.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you...?\u201d She asks.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Remus shakes his head. He can feel every place Sirius pressed.<br>\n<br>\n\u201cWere you...?\u201d<br>\n<br>\nRemus grimaces and Gemma smirks slyly. It reminds him of friends at Hogwarts, the ones lost to war too early. Their names stacked on top of each other in his memories. They weren't wrong then and Gemma isn't now.</p>\n<p>Because late at night, just the two of them, Remus dares to <em> want. </em>Sirius by firelight. Sirius reading to Harry. Sirius crying. Sirius laughing. He is just as loud and vibrant and angry in the rebuild of his life as he was in its destruction and Remus,\u00a0<em>Merlin,\u00a0</em>Remus loves... but he can't. He won't. That road is trampled and it hurts.\u00a0</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Time marches on.</p>\n<p>Remus celebrates his 25th birthday wrapped in a blanket on the sofa. He is surrounded by the Weasleys, Harry and Sirius. His bones thump and the moon tugs at him. Sirius sings happy birthday ridiculously out of tune until Molly slaps him on the arm and he settles back into his classically Pureblood vocals, a lovingly sarcastic twist to the tone. Remus blows out the candles on his birthday cake and tries not to notice how shallow his breath is. There is grey at his temples already. He aches.\u00a0</p>\n<p>March to April. April to May.</p>\n<p>Sirius continues to have nightmares. The new year has not robbed him of that. He wakes in cold sweats and paces around the room. Remus listens to each footstep until he cannot bear the pain of it anymore and creaks downstairs.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cTell me,\u201d he says gently. He presses a cup of tea into Sirius\u2019s shaking hands. He guides him to the kitchen table. Or when Sirius is furiously, justifiably angry he takes him outside so that he can scream without waking Harry.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Sirius will talk or yell or both. About the dead blankness of James\u2019s eyes. About Lily crumpled next to the crib and the tears and snot and blood that ran down baby Harry\u2019s face. About Peter, who laughed even as he sliced his own finger to drop heavily on the floor, a gavel sentencing Sirius to Azkaban without trial. About the Dementors. The cold flagstones of Azkaban. The prisoners who raved. The ones who gloated. And the awful, slow suck of his memory, the selective misery of his existence on repeat.\u00a0</p>\n<p>When it\u2019s over and he has talked himself out for the night, Sirius will turn to Remus. Sometimes his eyes will be wet. Sometimes there will be dread. Most often they search for something Remus isn\u2019t sure he can give. \u201cTell me,\u201d he says. \u201cRemus, tell me.\u201d<br>\n<br>\nAnd Remus will think blankly of the emptiness and the drugs he took and the bodies he let take him and the moon that ruled him. What excuse did he have? To be so empty without Dementors to take it from him. To be so angry without knowing true injustice. War made him who he was. The silent destruction that followed, well Remus has nobody to blame for that but himself.\u00a0</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>The next moon is too much. Instead of flooing to the Burrow, Remus sends a Patronus to Molly to tell them he has an <em> errand </em>and escapes to a werewolf hideout instead. He lets the drugs disappear him, the rolling of bodies, the teeth of sharp, sweaty animals. He lets a wolf with dark hair put his hands on him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d The wolf asks. His mouth scrapes against Remus\u2019s neck. His eyes are grey and hungry. \u201cC\u2019mon, tell me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Remus flinches. He pushes back from the man and weaves his way through the crowd, where animals rut up against each other and blood has already spilled across the floor. Creatures roar. Remus feels it rise in his chest. He apparates home.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Sirius is there. His head snaps up when Remus falls through the door. He watches Remus for a long time. The way he scrambles to get himself in some semblance of order. To hide the bruise on his neck and stem the flow of blood from scars that have torn open.</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you <em> high?\u201d </em>Sirius asks incredulously.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI... I don\u2019t...\u201d There\u2019s no excuse. Remus can barely hold a thought. He is lost and barren. He misses Sirius like he misses the bones in his body when they splinter and betray him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cFucking hell, Moony. Fucking hell.\u201d But his hands are gentle as he helps Remus up. And he\u2019s steady as he leads him to bed. And his voice is soft as he traces his wand along the worst of Remus\u2019s wounds.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI can\u2019t do this for much longer,\u201d Sirius says. His fingers brush through Remus\u2019s grey hair. \u201c<em>You </em> can\u2019t do this for much longer. Something will break.\u201d His eyes say,\u00a0<em>you</em><em>\u00a0will.</em></p>\n<p>Remus grabs Sirius\u2019s wrist. He digs his sharp fingers into the bone. Feels the pulse that hammers him home. Is reassured by it. Needs it. They look at each other for a very long time.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI still do,\u201d Remus tries to confess, drugs twisting the dark, ugly words out of his mouth. The ones he hasn't been able to say, even to Harry.<em>\u00a0I still do love you, can\u2019t you see this is for you? Can\u2019t you see you deserve more than this? </em> His throat is thick with unshed tears. \u201cEven when I thought you were... when you\u2019d... I couldn\u2019t help but... Isn\u2019t that <em> fucked up... </em>\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cShhh,\u201d Sirius says. \u201cOkay? Tell me tomorrow. Tell me.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>The next morning there is a letter tucked in with their Daily Prophet. Sirius shakes it loose as he takes a bite of his toast and tries to stop Harry from sloshing milk on the table. Remus surveys the scene before he carefully inches into the room. Harry says, <em> Remy Remy watch this </em>as the dragons in his cereal start to bellow marshmallow fire and Remus smooths a hand down the back of Harry\u2019s head. Sirius gives him a small, tired smile. There\u2019s a promise in his grey eyes. He looks back down at the letter.</p>\n<p>Remus swallows. He can barely remember... just the way Sirius had rested his hand on his forehead. And the way his mouth had looked as he formed words. And his wrist in Remus\u2019s hand. He hopes he didn't. He hopes he <em> did</em>...\u00a0</p>\n<p>Instead Remus settles at the table and picks up the paper. He whips it open just as Sirius, low and angry, says <em> fucking hell. </em> All of a sudden, Remus can feel bile rise in the back of his mouth. Days, months, years-old sick. His body rattles empty. Harry says, <em> Aunty Molly said that\u2019s a bad word </em> but Remus can barely hear it.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He looks up at Sirius. Between them is their childhood, sunken and dark. The final broken piece flung free. Sirius\u2019s grey eyes are so hard and unforgiving it hurts. Remus looks back down at the stark headline in black and white. He puts the paper down. Isn\u2019t it awful that even after, <em> after, </em>Remus had forgotten him. Peter alone at the pub. Peter alone in a cell.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em> Peter Pettigrew to receive the Kiss. </em>\n</p>\n<p align=\"right\">Give me one more year to get back on track<br>Give me one more life to win you back<br>Smoke's in our eyes or in the distance<br>Either way, we're gonna miss it<br>When it's gone</p>\n<p align=\"right\">- Matt Berninger, One More Second\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Peter\u2019s Kiss takes place in a stifled, closed room at the Ministry. It hums of dark, sick magic. Remus can feel it shudder up his newly-healed bones. The walls and floor are made of curved, black tiles. They shuffle in and sit on rows of stadium-like steps, let the cold soak into their backs and thighs. There\u2019s hardly any people to witness the devastation.\u00a0</p>\n<p><em> This is justice, </em> Sirius had argued in the silence of their<em>\u00a0</em>kitchen. The letter still clutched in his hand, Harry still munching unaware of the turn of the Earth and the two men desperately trying to stay on it.\u00a0</p>\n<p><em> It won\u2019t bring them back, </em>Remus had replied. For days that sat between them as they skirted around the edges of their past and the people that used to be in it.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Now the Wizengamot members are stern, Dumbledore\u2019s face appropriately grave, McGonagall an ached frown and Peter\u2019s mother sobs so wretchedly silent it\u2019s like she has nothing left to give but blank despair. She is closest to the chair in the middle of the room.</p>\n<p>Remus can\u2019t... he can barely sit still. He can taste the stench of Dementors in the air and the spark of silver that the Ministry protects its walls with. His leg moves restlessly and he pokes at the worn holes of his trousers until Sirius places a hand over his. They don\u2019t look at each other.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Merlin, he wants a cigarette. He wants to escape. He wants to run and hide. He wants to turn back time so that he never has to sit in this room with these people waiting for... but then it\u2019s too late.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Peter is hauled in.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He is skinny, his prisoner garment torn and hanging off his limbs. His blonde hair is limp and ragged. His eyes are empty pools and Remus flashes back to how scared and round they\u2019d been on their first night in Gryffindor tower, when the wind had howled around the dorm and James and Sirius had laughed at the small, rotund boy whose cheeks went red with fear.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Remus had comforted him then. There\u2019s a part of him that wants to comfort him now. There\u2019s a larger part that hates himself for that and hates Peter for still, <em>still, </em>invoking that base instinct in him. Remus can very easily push away the bright and good. But the dark, the twisted, the tormented. He wants to fold those perverse pack members into his arms and shake them until he\u2019s bloody.<em>\u00a0</em></p>\n<p>\u201cPeter Pettigrew, you have been found guilty of aiding and abetting the first-degree murder of James Potter and Lily Potter,\u201d says the head Wizengamot judge. Her voice is hard, firm. Remus blanches at the cold, factual declaration that spins around the room. Sirius vibrates in restrained rage.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou have been found guilty of aiding and abetting the attempted first-degree murder of Harry James Potter. You have been found guilty of attempted first-degree murder of Sirius Black III. You have been found guilty of second-degree mass murder of twelve non-magical persons including three children.\u201d</p>\n<p>Remus swallows, breathes. How,<em> how? </em></p>\n<p>\u201cYou have been found guilty of magic exposure to the non-magical public. You have been found guilty of conspiring to commit murder on multiple occassions as outlined in witness testimonies. You have been found guilty as a member of the outlawed hate organisation known as the Death Eaters for which your atrocities know no bounds. For these crimes, we are here today to carry out the sentence applied to you. The Dementor\u2019s Kiss.\u201d</p>\n<p>If Dementors could feel any emotion other than hungry despair, the ones that swoop in behind Peter would be positively gleeful. Their bodies and faces are like a black hole, twisting and sucking all light and energy from the room. They circle around Peter, hungry animals ready for their prey. They are cold, the air bounces off the tiles and is pulled out of their lungs in a sick consumption.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Next to him, Sirius startles. His breath is shallow. <em> Are you sure you want to do this? </em> Remus had asked him yesterday. The echo of Sirius\u2019s screams in the dark of night reverberate around them. <em> I have to, </em>Sirius had replied.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Now, Sirius leans forward. He controls his breath. And he looks, angrily, desperately at the downcast face of Peter. What he wants to see, Remus doesn\u2019t know. What he expects to find will not be there.\u00a0</p>\n<p><em> Why? </em> Remus had desperately asked Peter a lifetime ago. And Peter had looked him in the eyes and had burned his cheeks against the prison bars and said, <em> Sirius\u2019s face, in the street. I was powerful and he was powerless. </em>Does he still feel powerful, strapped to a chair and starved and facing soullessness? Has he left Sirius and Remus powerless still?</p>\n<p>Remus wants to shake him, wants to ask again, what it meant, why he did it, how he could. They have had everything wrenched from them. He wants to say it was Peter\u2019s fault, but he knows, perhaps better than Sirius, more logically, with a forced analytical distance, that the events of that Halloween had been a long time coming. That Sirius made a mistake. That Remus did. That James and Lily did. And that Peter did a hundred times over, blindly traitorous and grasping and scared and angry.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you have any last words?\u201d the Wizengamot judge asks.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Peter takes a long time to look up. As if his head is too heavy, his body stiff and unused. He is already detached from it, like he is water in a vessel ready to be emptied out into sea. When he finally does, his gaze bypasses his weeping mother and focuses directly on Sirius and Remus.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He opens his dry, cracked lips. \u201cI don\u2019t regret it,\u201d he says clearly. \u00a0<br><br>Remus hears it like a claw to the stomach. Next to him, Sirius stands. He\u2019s distantly yelling, <em> you traitor. You bastard! How dare you, how fucking dare you...\u00a0 </em></p>\n<p>But Peter\u2019s eyes skip over him. Attach to Remus again, clasped, like he is a Dementor and Remus is the victim sentenced to drain slowly.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNot a single moment of it.\u201d And Peter smiles. And he is the boy he used to be. And war, and time and betrayal seeps away. And in that twisted smile is a pool of sadness that has a depth Remus can\u2019t begin to reach and Remus <em> doesn\u2019t, doesn\u2019t forgive him, </em>how could he ever, even if they had once called each other pack?</p>\n<p>And Sirius is crying and yelling and furious but Remus knows that even he, <em> Merlin</em>, even he wouldn\u2019t dare change a single moment of their shared past because it had been so joyously happy. Except for the end. The devastation that Peter brutally and vindictively chose for them all for no other reason than that they made him feel what he never wanted to be. He had killed them for it. He had orphaned Harry for it. He had decimated their lives.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The Dementors swoop closer as McGonagall grabs Sirius\u2019s arm and hauls him back. With each pass, Peter is sucked emptier and emptier. His eyes go glassy, like the first time he got drunk in Hogsmeade and they had to carry him home. And his cheeks sallow like when he broke his arm during his only attempt at Quidditch under James\u2019s proud and concerned and laughing gaze.</p>\n<p>And there goes the happiness, in the air. The sweets that Peter used to share when Remus was sad. The pranks he could never quite come up with but jubilantly joined every detention for. The late night laughter. His first kiss, the first of all Marauders, and the midnight pub excursions and the letters home to his mother and the homework and the mischief and the heartbreak.\u00a0</p>\n<p>And there goes even the darkness, pulled into the destruction. The whispers of <em> wolf </em> in James and Sirius\u2019s ears, the dark mark stark on a pale forearm, the scared blankness of his lies and black robes and alleys and the nights he waited alone for people who hardly ever showed but would have when he needed, <em> would have.\u00a0 </em></p>\n<p>The glow of his soul is sucked slow and empty. It is terrible. Atrocious and monstrous to see it stripped from him, even if he deserves it. Even when.\u00a0</p>\n<p>And then it is over. And he is powerless. And he is empty. And with that the past they once had and the future he, they, all of them could have had together is empty. A strange, hollow grief settles over Remus. He feels sick in his throat.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Slowly, they are ushered out of the room. Ministry workers flinch away from them.<br><br>At one point, Dumbledore talks to them. Something about <em> a memory that was taken from Peter </em> and <em> can I ask you please... one last time? </em></p>\n<p>And Sirius turns to him, fierce and low and angry. \u201cNo,\u201d he says. It brooks no arguments. He puts his hand on Remus\u2019s shoulder, steers them both away from these wizards who make judgements like they have the right to play politics with people\u2019s small and crumbling lives. \u201cYou have asked enough.\u201d</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>When they apparate back home, Remus vomits in the garden.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThat was awful,\u201d Remus says. He can\u2019t say anymore.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Sirius is bleak. His eyes have shadows that look like James and Lily. The outlines of their body on the floor of the family home. The sick, snake-green of death. \u201cYes,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>They go inside. Their cottage is as it has always has been. Remus feels wrapped in its embrace. He sees the corners where Harry has followed a crayon along the wall. Sirius\u2019s book splayed open on the sofa. A blanket tossed on the ground. Remus\u2019s hands shake as he pours a whiskey for them each.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cFor James and Lily,\u201d Sirius says. He raises the glass and looks over its rim at Remus. His hand shakes.<br><br>And in his mind, Remus thinks, <em> for Peter too. </em>For the boy he had once been. The friend they had loved. For Peter had died too, today and with every choice he made during the war. In small and final ways. Now he is finally gone in an obscene pantomime of intimacy.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cFor James and Lily,\u201d he repeats.\u00a0</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>When Molly drops Harry back home the next day, she puts her hand on each man\u2019s cheek. Her eyes are gentle. Remus remembers her brothers, the Prewetts. She has lost much to war too. She was broken too. But the home she has built, the children she nurtures, she continues on.</p>\n<p>\u201cBe done with it now,\u201d Molly says. She smiles.\u00a0</p>\n<p>They sit with Harry for a long time. They watch him. He is beautiful and alive and more powerful in his gentleness and kindness than Peter Pettigrew could ever want or understand. He chases the butterflies in the garden and laughs delightedly at the rabbits that spring from the forest.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you think James and Lily...\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Sirius says. He looks lost and sad. \u201cWe do the best we can.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>When it is lunch time, Harry wanders over to the two men. He takes Sirius\u2019s hand and they all sit down for a picnic in the backyard.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d Harry asks carefully. He looks shy. He may not understand what is happening but they are family and Harry can tell. Harry knows. <em> Perhaps that is what the word love means</em>, Remus thinks to himself, <em> to know and be known. </em></p>\n<p>Sirius bundles Harry into his arms. Remus nudges them both with his shoulder and smiles. It feels right.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes Harry,\u201d he says gently. \u201cWe\u2019ll be okay.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Later, Sirius and Remus sit outside under the stars. Harry is safe in bed upstairs, tucked in his blankets <em> like ham in a sandwich, </em>Remus says as he tightens the covers and Sirius smooths his hand down Harry\u2019s forehead. Their child. It is precious and terrible to have the privilege of Harry. To love him and guide him and see him bloom into a future for James and Lily.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Now, the two men watch the silent night. Without Harry, words slip in the gaps between them, conversations unfinished and pains unprodded. They have barely spoken since the night of the moon. When Remus, drunk on pain and uninhibited, had nearly unearthed the terrible truth inside of him.</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you remember when Peter...\u201d he starts, taking a drag of his cigarette. And Sirius looks at him with a deep, tired anger. They have hurt too much. Suffered enough.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t talk about him,\u201d Sirius says. \u201cI don\u2019t want to hear his name ever again.\u201d\u00a0<br><br>\u201cBut he\u2019s part of us, isn\u2019t he?\u201d Remus tosses his cigarette to the ground and wraps his arms around himself. He is cold and dark. The Dementors still linger in his body, no amount of chocolate able to drive away the terrible certainty of what they can take. To think Sirius spent years in their embrace is too horrendous to linger on.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNo. If there is one thing I want to forget, it's him.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>And Remus shudders. Peter\u2019s eyes haunt him, a ghost that drags Remus out like he is disappearing into his own hollow kiss, the emptiness inside him enveloping his waking hours even as he tries to count the precious time he still has left to live them.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI can\u2019t forget. I don\u2019t want to,\u201d Remus says stubbornly.<br><br>\u201cWhy?\u201d Sirius asks. His voice rises. His mouth is clenched. \u201cHow can you feel <em> sorry </em>for him?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>And Remus looks at him for a long time. The way the wind rustles the trees of the forest and the dark hair that whips around Sirius\u2019s cheekbones. How the hollow indent of his cheeks leads to his full mouth and the tattoos he used to know and the ones he still discovers. His eyes, gazing away from Remus and into the sky where he and his family are etched in a terrible history that tries not to repeat itself.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cBecause I still loved you,\u201d Remus says quietly.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Sirius blanches.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe was my friend and he destroyed us and I want to forgive him but I don\u2019t, I never will. Not like I forgave you.\u201d<br><br>\u201cRemus...\u201d Sirius takes a stumbling step towards him, but Remus flinches back. Oh, to open the cavern inside you and let someone look at the emptiness. Isn\u2019t this what he\u2019d been scared of all along? Now he hopes someone can finally see it before it\u2019s all gone, kissed away like Peter was.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou thought I was the traitor and you did the correct thing. You pushed me out of your life. You... you stopped loving me because you loved <em> James more </em>and fuck okay, of course that\u2019s okay. But I thought you\u2019d killed them and even then I couldn't... do you know how fucking selfishly grateful I was when you were innocent? I loved you when I thought you were a murderer and... don\u2019t you dare say I shouldn\u2019t try and do the same for him, don\u2019t you dare...\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Sirius takes Remus\u2019s face in his hands. His eyes are dark and rounder than the moon that overhangs them and the shadow of the past it casts over their future.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cRemus...\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Sirius wavers forward. A gasp between them. His lips, startlingly close.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Remus kisses him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>It\u2019s as easy as taking his next breath. As safe. As warm. Sirius groans and pulls him closer, one hand tangles in the hair at the nape of Remus\u2019s neck like an anchor. His fingers press into the soft spot. He tastes the same. He kisses the same. Fierce and overwhelming and consuming. Sirius has always been good at taking what he wants and now he slots back in like a missing piece, seamless.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Moony,</em>\u201d Sirius murmurs against his lips. He leans back. Kisses his cheek, the vulnerable underbelly of Remus's neck. His lips, again.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Remus slams his eyes shut. It\u2019s too soft, too much like care. Instead he pulls Sirius\u2019s hair and the man takes a shaky breath. Sirius's eyes are dark and soft under the night sky. He is gentle. Remus is not gentle. He is consumed and angry and he <em> hates Peter </em>and he doesn\u2019t and he\u2019s animal and he\u2019s not and he loves Sirius and sometimes he doesn't want to.</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Sirius says. He <em>knows </em>him, isn't that the joke? It hurts to be known.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Sirius pushes Remus back against the wall. He gasps as Sirius bites bruises onto his neck, as they pant into each other's mouths. His hands dig into Remus's hips, up the back of his shirt, the waistband of his trousers. This, this is what a body is for. Not cracked pain, bones and blood. <em>This.\u00a0</em></p>\n<p>\u201cI want your... I want your...\u201d Remus can\u2019t think.<br><br>Sirius laughs into the hollow of his neck. He pushes Remus\u2019s hair back from his forehead with his giant, rough hands. Whispers darkly into his ear, \u201cI know what you want, darling. I know.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>When they stumble upstairs and fall into bed, Sirius traps Remus\u2019s wrists above his head. Slides into him slowly, like he is breakable. He is not. Many have tried. Instead, he feels the wounds finally starting to scab, to scar. Sirius pants in his ear. He thrusts harder, like he is starved, like he never believed he could, like he never believed they would again. It is hot and consuming and he claws at Sirius\u2019s back and finally cries like he hasn\u2019t since the first anonymous fuck after Sirius was imprisoned.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOh sweetheart,\u201d Sirius says. He wipes the tears away, kisses Remus again. His mouth is <em> everything</em>. \u201cI\u2019ve got you.\u201d</p>\n<p>His lips taste like the salt. His face is so close that Remus can see every lash, every freckle. The scar James gave him next to his ear. The one Remus did next to his mouth. The marks that said they were there, once. They existed and it was real.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI missed you,\u201d Remus says. \u201cI missed you, I\u2019m sorry, I missed you.\u201d<br><br>And Sirius replies in turn. \u201cI did too, I\u2019m sorry, I love you.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Later when the sweat cools on their body, Sirius traces his hand down a long scar on Remus\u2019s torso. It\u2019s new to Sirius. As are most of his scars. As are most of Sirius\u2019s. They are learning each other again.<br><br>\u201cTell me,\u201d Sirius says. His eyes are shadowed and for the first time Remus doesn\u2019t feel like he\u2019s talking to the ghost of the boy he\u2019d once loved. No, instead it is the man. Sirius is grown and hurt and angry and broken into pieces just like Remus is. They are changed, forever.\u00a0</p>\n<p>James is gone. Lily is gone. Peter is now gone. And the people that Sirius and Remus had been are gone too, the relationship they had marred by too many betrayals. But this one, this family they have created. It\u2019s new and vulnerable and tender and painful.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Maybe it\u2019s time he grieved for what they had been and what they have lost. Maybe it\u2019s time he let himself accept this new reality. Every time he\u2019d dared to hope, it had been taken away brutally. But fuck, maybe it\u2019s time.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Remus closes his eyes. He starts to talk.</p>\n<p align=\"right\">but here i am with arms unfolding<br>i guess it isn't quite the end<br>old partner in crime, i am going to try<br>to fall in love with you again.<br>- dodie, <em> arms unfolding </em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Conversations start like this:</p>\n<p>Curved, warm light across the aristocratic nose of Sirius Black. His dark hair splayed like scars across Remus\u2019s white pillow. His mouth, upturned. His eyes search Remus\u2019s face in the golden arch of sunrise and the grey sweep of them feels like a caress. Remus smiles too, teetering on the precipice of sad. His wounds exposed.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re beautiful,\u201d Sirius says carefully. \u201cI\u2019d forgotten that.\u201d<br><br>\u201cYou are too,\u201d Remus replies. \u201cI hadn\u2019t.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kindness is something to be practiced. In their soft disheveled sheets as the sun rises, they are gentle with each other. They are gentled.\u00a0</p>\n<p>And:\u00a0</p>\n<p>Harry, again. \u201cTell me about Mummy and Daddy,\u201d he says.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Remus and Sirius look over his head at each other. Then back down at the photo book that Harry has recently become more interested in, his tiny hands tracing the ghost of Lily\u2019s smile and the spark of James\u2019s eyes. It aches, to think that maybe the time has come that he realises something is missing. That perhaps they can\u2019t cover the hurt, only soothe it.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Remus presses his hand to Harry\u2019s cheek, who looks up at him with bright and trusting eyes. Magic, Harry is. Pure, beautiful magic. \u201cWell, the first thing you need to know about your Daddy is he\u2019s the most <em> stubborn </em>man I ever met, even more than Sirius here...\u201d</p>\n<p>Memories wrap between the three of them, embraced and warm and loved. James and Lily are in every breath, in every laugh, in every tear. Sirius smiles.\u00a0</p>\n<p>And:\u00a0</p>\n<p>Remus, naked in front of a mirror. His scars are pink and raised. Wrapped around the hard, boney edges of his body. Behind him, Sirius catches his eye. The rough pads of his fingertips trace a bite over Remus\u2019s hip. The indent of each tooth is brutally clear. A question.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSix months, after... after everything,\u201d Remus says. He looks away, remembers the sink of nearly-werewolf teeth into his hip and the tongue that traced the blood that welled up before it entered his mouth, sick and swollen. \u201cI wanted it, I guess.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Later Remus tells him about how he spent a month moving shit at a farm in Wales until he couldn\u2019t breathe without the fumes being ingested into his body but the mindless repetitiveness of the shovel in and out stopped him from even thinking the names James, and Lily, and Peter, and Sirius.\u00a0</p>\n<p>How he\u2019d sat in sick and piss until Dumbledore and Moody remembered him. How he\u2019d often wished they hadn\u2019t, that he sometimes thought they really might not have \u2013 and this was all a dream, that he lay there still in a world that he could never imagine.\u00a0</p>\n<p>And he tells Sirius how some nights he\u2019d look up at the crescent moon and think, <em> again again how can I do another</em>... and so he would find a warm body that had dark hair like Sirius and dark eyes like Sirius and a smile like Sirius and would feel found, for a moment.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>How he would flinch when he saw a baby with green eyes. Or a man in round spectacles. Or a woman with a sympathetic smile. And so he stopped being around people all together. His next job, in a remote castle on a bleak, distant island, was based in a dusty underground cellar sorting historic papers for an absent lord. He saw nobody and smoked cigarettes until his lungs burned and fucked the blonde gardener and didn\u2019t dare linger on the past for a second.\u00a0</p>\n<p>How he spent longer and longer lying in the brambles, on moss, in the dirt, after a moon. His body empty and bleeding and decaying and aching until the ongoing trudge of his will to live kicked in. How sometimes he wished it wouldn\u2019t.\u00a0</p>\n<p>How he couldn\u2019t look at the stars without thinking about Sirius.</p>\n<p>How he was so fucking, unbelievably furious at James. And at Lily. And at Sirius. And at Peter.\u00a0</p>\n<p>So angry sometimes that it burned like the pull of the moon and how he was so afraid that his rage would slink into his memories like a rotten, starved beast and tear right through them that it made him helpless and hopeless and animal and...\u00a0</p>\n<p>And then Sirius tells him that it's alright, fuck, <em> of course it's alright Moony, to be angry. Of course, Merlin, of course. </em>And Remus cries until he feels full again.\u00a0</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>The war Remus cannot find the words for. It clings to the back of his throat until he wants to be sick with the pain of it. So instead, Sirius says <em> show me.\u00a0 </em></p>\n<p>One evening when Harry is having a sleepover, <em> please please Remy can I go, Ron promised me we\u2019d throw gnomes, </em> Remus takes Sirius\u2019s hand and apparates to the wilds of Scotland. He sits on the ground, hard. Beneath his feet he can feel the memory of congealed blood and torn throats and the sharp shudder of his fear, left like an echo in the dark abyss of the sky.</p>\n<p>He looks up at Sirius, blank, empty. \u201cHere is where I killed another wolf for the first time,\u201d Remus says.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Sirius inhales sharply. He reaches a hand out, then stops.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Remus looks away, bites his lip. \u201cDumbledore... he told me it was a secret mission. To tell you that I was doing a research job. So I did. But every time I was called away it was to a different pack. To ask them to join our side in the war. To run with them and...\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>He takes a breath and lies down in the dirt to look up at the sky. Did the bones of the wolf he killed stay here to decay, to sink into the mud with the winter rain? Distantly, he hears Sirius clamber down to lie next to him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThey were scared, mostly. Some of the packs were kids, <em> kids.</em>..\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou were a kid,\u201d Sirius interrupts.<br><br>It startles Remus. He turns to look at him. Sirius\u2019s eyes are hollow and fierce. He looks furiously angry, despairing. Sick. Remus turns back to the sky.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI suppose so,\u201d he acquiesces. \u201cMost of them wanted nothing to do with Wizard politics. The young packs, or the family ones, or the hidden ones, mostly lived off the land. They were kind. After a while, the Order told me to give up on them. To go after the... not so peaceful packs.\u201d<br><br>Remus feels his fingers dig into the hard ground beneath his palm. \u201cSo I did. And I ran under the moon with them. And I let them bite and I bit them and when it was over we would cower together in the dark underground corners of their hideouts where they fucked and took drugs and cried and hoped desperately for something better...\u201d</p>\n<p>He turns to Sirius, whose eyes glisten with tears. \u201cI tried, Sirius, I really did. They were scared. Their leaders were cruel. I worked my way up... I... so many died. I thought maybe, maybe if we joined the war we could show the Wizarding World that we were more than animals. That we could help, that we were good. Maybe they wouldn\u2019t let powerful wolves take advantage of these helpless ones...\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>He shakes his head. \u201cThen Greyback turned up,\u201d Remus laughs ugly. It chokes him. \u201cHe was, fuck. My personal nightmare. He looked at me all the time. He knew what I wanted, he knew what I would risk to get it. He started to... play the wolves against each other. To whisper in their ears about a new power they could have. The next time I turned up for the moon... one of the young ones attacked me.\u201d<br><br>Remus closes his eyes. \u201cHe was, <em> Merlin, </em>he would have only been 16. He leapt on me and it was ugly and awful and... I killed him.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Remus can taste the blood in his teeth even now. Can feel the way the boy\u2019s bones cracked beneath his palms and how the word monster sat smugly on his shoulders and had covered his body ever since. How when he got home from that mission, Sirius had kissed him in greeting and Remus flinched away for the first time. The beginning of the end of it all.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cGreyback laughed, when it was done. Clapped me on the back. Said, <em> stronger than you look Lupin, </em> like a proud father. It was...\u201d he looks at Sirius suddenly, desperate. \u201cThat\u2019s not even the worst of it, that\u2019s not even... fuck, how can you <em> look at me</em>... how can you touch...\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Gently, Sirius kisses the words out of his mouth. Remus doesn\u2019t flinch.\u00a0</p>\n<p>*\u00a0</p>\n<p>That night, Remus dreams. A memory.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He\u2019s at the beginning of sixth year, when the Prank still hovers like an eclipse and the end of their time at Hogwarts seems both impossibly far away and improbably close.\u00a0</p>\n<p>James slides smoothly into the seat opposite Remus, the library hushed and reverent around them. His dark, black hair has grown wild in front of his eyes. Remus remembers how he\u2019d twirl it around one finger and shoot a wink at Lily when she dared to look. Somehow, James had grown serious that year. The childish mischief that clung to him like baby fat had melted away in slow contemplation.\u00a0</p>\n<p>In dream, in memory, he looks at Remus steadily from behind his glasses. His eyes trace the scar that Remus knows runs deep at the side of his neck, the curled remnants of antlers.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou love him, don\u2019t you?\u201d James says simply.</p>\n<p>And his hand shoots out across the table, snags the sleeve of Remus\u2019s sweater before he can fold into himself and scurry away. Merlin, the four of them had known each other like more than brothers, like soulmates, like they could anticipate each other\u2019s moves before they\u2019d even been set in motion.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Dream-Remus freezes just like he did that day. Like a wild beast that knew it was outmatched. He looks away, at the books that surround them with their impossible stories. To love Sirius was a dangerous rebellion. To love him was hard. But he did, he <em> did.\u00a0 </em></p>\n<p>So Remus nods, and awful tears spring to his eyes. He shudders into James, whose arms wrap protectively around him. And the silence of the aftermath of the Prank is broken with that last destructive secret \u2013 that Remus could never stay angry at Sirius even when he should.</p>\n<p>Remus\u2019s dream lingers. And the candles of the library get bright when in reality they had melted down into stumps before he\u2019d disentangled himself from James. In his half-dream state, he can still feel James\u2019s arms on him, the soft curl of his hair.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cTell him,\u201d James whispers, like he did that day. Like he does now, in the dream. \u201cTell him you berk, can\u2019t you see he loves you too?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>When he wakes, it\u2019s with Sirius\u2019s arms around him and James\u2019s voice in his ear. A beautiful echo. An ache.\u00a0</p>\n<p>*\u00a0</p>\n<p>With the onset of warm weather, breakfast becomes an outdoor affair. They take a picnic basket into the backyard, lovingly packed with outrageously sugary cereal and colourful fruit and a thermos of hot coffee, and spread out on a blanket to eat under the delicious morning sun.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Harry\u2019s skin and entire disposition glows in happiness and even Remus reluctantly starts to peel and tan.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s good for you,\u201d Sirius laughs as he applies more sun cream to Remus\u2019s shoulders. \u201cJamie always said you\u2019d turn into a ghost if you spent too much time indoors.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry giggles. Remus rolls his eyes and puts a blob of sun cream onto Harry\u2019s nose, who goes cross-eyed trying to look at it before he gives up and scrubs it away.\u00a0</p>\n<p>They eat quietly, listening instead to the birds that chirp around them and the bees that Harry imitates and the push-pull of the wind through the forest at the edge of their gate. The forest Harry isn\u2019t even remotely afraid of anymore, only curious, only gentle.\u00a0</p>\n<p>When Harry eats an entire piece of fruit by himself, they clap his achievement. When Remus's fingers twitch but he resists a cigarette with his coffee, Sirius mockingly raises an eyebrow and claps him too. Remus sticks his tongue out and instantly regrets it when Harry starts imitating him with mischievous interest.\u00a0</p>\n<p>In a moment of absolute clarity, Remus suddenly realises he has never felt this happy. Not since school, when the Marauders would lounge next to the lake and Sirius would kiss him, lips still warm and wet. Now, in this exact moment, he can see the new future that has appeared. And it stretches forward endlessly and doesn\u2019t feel empty. No, it seems pressingly full with wonder.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Opposite him, Sirius has gone still. Perhaps sensing a shift in Remus\u2019s mood. He always had been incredibly perceptive and he still is, Remus had forgotten that. How they could catch each other across a room and how Remus could <em>know in return</em> and not just be known. He smiles at how it feels. At how it fills.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHarry,\u201d Remus says. He crouches low. He looks at this wondrous boy, who has started putting wildflowers in his hair and hums along with bees and runs with vigour and laughs, always. Gone in his mind is the image of the boy who hid under a bed and shook. Who asked for a cupboard. Instead Harry is radiant. And they will have the exquisite agony and pleasure to see him grow up. To have their lives restored by him. <em> \u00a0 </em></p>\n<p>\u201cI love you,\u201d Remus says. His palm caresses the side of Harry\u2019s head, catches on a flower and holds there for a moment. \"I <em>love</em> you.\"<br><br>And Harry, blindingly happy and oblivious, looks at him sweetly in return. As if it is no big deal because he knows what love is and he\u2019s received it in spades. It makes Remus want to cry. \u201cI love you too Remy,\u201d Harry replies brightly.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Over his shoulder, Sirius watches. Sirius smiles. Sirius mouths, <em> I love you too.\u00a0 </em></p>\n<p align=\"right\"><em> It gets easy to become blind to<br></em> <em> The good things when times are rough<br></em> <em> But when there's nothing left to try and do<br></em> <em> It's okay to throw your hands up<br></em> <em> 'Cause there's no use in getting burned<br></em> <em> From the same lessons that you learned<br></em> <em> So carry them with you and be wiser </em> <em> \u00a0 </em></p>\n<p align=\"right\">\u2013 Laura Zocca, The Art Of Getting By\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Once, Remus believed that happiness was as simple as sailing across the Great Lake into the outstretched arms of three boys he would call more than friends. That it was a path you could follow on a map or the joyous adventuring of four animals in a forbidden wood.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Now he knows better. Remus has been betrayed and betrayer. He has seen death and caused death and grieved death too many times. And happiness \u2013\u00a0he has learned \u2013 simply doesn\u2019t come naturally. It can be taken away in a flash of green. In a whispered lie and a cry. In the pause between ragged breaths and a cracked werewolf neck.\u00a0</p>\n<p>But fuck, that doesn\u2019t mean he shouldn\u2019t work for it every day.\u00a0</p>\n<p>To live, <em> Merlin </em>to really bloody live \u2013 happiness is simply a choice he must make. A deliberate action he has to take. For Harry, who knows what it means to be unloved but chooses love anyway. For Sirius, who was forgotten but chooses to remember. And mostly \u2013\u00a0and this is where it gets tricky \u2013 mostly, Remus has to choose happiness for himself. He has to soak in it until the dried cracks of his brittle bones break so they can finally be set right again.\u00a0</p>\n<p>In their beautiful, short existence, James and Lily had chosen happiness. In war, they had chosen love. In death, they had chosen Harry\u2019s life. And in darkness, they had chosen laughter. They had laughed until they cried, held close in the knowledge that sometimes all you will have left is the echo of it in your throat to remind yourself of just how happy you had really been.\u00a0</p>\n<p>And so he holds on. And he gets by. And when Remus looks at Sirius and Harry \u2013 at the home they have built and the love they carefully tender \u2013 he laughs. And he lets the echo of it reverberate out like ripples on the surface of the Great Lake as he glides toward the two people who showed him that happiness may not be easy \u2013 but when the healing itch of pain subsides, there really is nothing left to choose but the freshly laid future ahead, ready to sail once more.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>One summer afternoon when the light is barely descending towards the horizon and Sirius \u2013 shameless\u2013 has thrown off his shirt to bask in the sun and give the neighbours a show, the house at End Lane is visited by a small tabby cat with very familiar markings around the eyes.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Remus hears the ward alarms sound and watches as the cat stops on the front path and observes the scene with a haughty swish of her tail.</p>\n<p>Harry \u2013 who has a tendency to run towards and affectionately squeeze the daylight out of any animal he sees \u2013 fortunately hasn\u2019t spotted her yet. Instead, he plays in the front garden like he did so many moons ago, when it had just been the two of them and their helpless patch of dirt. Now it heaves with vegetation and tumbles \u2013 quite literally in Harry\u2019s case \u2013 with new life.</p>\n<p>\u201cWatch me, watch me, watch me!\u201d Harry cries to Sirius as he jumps over plants and does a clumsy half-forward roll.<br><br>Sirius has one hand over his eyes, shading them from the sun and deliberately not looking in Harry\u2019s direction. He has a smirk playing on the edges of his lips that Remus tries hard not to find disgustingly attractive.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m watching,\u201d Sirius says, his eyes closed.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Remus laughs. He wipes his forehead and plucks herbs from the garden with a reminder to create more tincture for Neris. And from the footpath, the tabby cat watches the scene play out in front of her. She looks at Remus with eyes that blaze knowingly. Her whiskers twitch in the approximation of a smile and she inclines her head once.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Remus smiles. He nods to her in return. Years \u2013 moons \u2013 an entire childhood \u2013 and this new life that she gave to him one fateful, hungover morning \u2013 passes between them.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Then he whips around suddenly as he hears Harry scream and Sirius let out a humongous \u201coomph!\u201d Harry\u2019s squeals turn to laughter from where he\u2019s thrown himself bodily onto Sirius\u2019s stomach as Sirius catches his breath, clutching dramatically at his aching ribs.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cRight, I\u2019m gonna get you for that!\u201d Sirius laughs. Harry runs away, ducking to hide behind Remus as Sirius launches to his feet with a mock growl. \u201cI\u2019m gonna gobble you right up!\u201d<br><br>By the time Remus thinks to look for the cat again, she is gone. Satisfied that the home Harry lives in now overflows with more love than the one she had visited so long ago.\u00a0</p>\n<p>*\u00a0</p>\n<p>Sadly, grief doesn\u2019t simply go away. It catches them in the oddest moments. When Sirius teaches Harry to play catch and the image of James\u2019s sparkling eyes and hands outstretched in victory threatens to overwhelm him. Or dinner at the Weasley\u2019s, when Molly pulls her orange-red hair up in a twist at the nape of her neck and sticks her wand haphazardly through it \u2013\u00a0not at all like Lily but <em>enough</em>, enough that Remus has to swallow and excuse himself from the table.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Later, when Sirius is helping Arthur in the shed \u2013 with who knows what vehicular disaster they\u2019re sure to hear about soon \u2013 Remus and Molly make a cup of tea. The kettle whistles between them as each mug hops itself down from the shelf, Remus\u2019s favourite misshapen one toddling straight into his hands.</p>\n<p>\u201cDoes it ever stop?\u201d Remus asks. He thinks of Molly and the twin brothers she adored, and the children that surround her.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Molly twists to look at him. \u201cDoes what stop?\u201d</p>\n<p>He grimaces, throws a hand out. \u201cThe... I don\u2019t know. The fear that it could all disappear tomorrow?\u201d<br><br>Molly laughs and it is bright and startling and obnoxious. \u201cOh Remus,\u201d she says, shaking her head as if he has told a particularly amusing joke.\u00a0</p>\n<p>They take their tea into the living room as she chuckles to herself. The entire Burrow sags in one corner. Rugs are worn through with the patter of feet and the endless stars of the night sky are visible through a haphazard window as Remus sinks down onto a dilapidated sofa.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This home is held together by three things: magic, love and Molly Weasley, who makes sure that every crack and crevice is infused with years of laughter and tears and whines of \u201cMuuuum!\u201d that descend down the stairs like an avalanche.<br><br>From where Remus sits, he can see the Weasley Clock. Last week, Arthur had added Harry, Remus and Sirius to it. He had mentioned it casually, like it was no big deal. Like they were simply part of the mechanics of their lives, forever turning together in endless time. It feels like a family he never knew he was missing and for a brief moment, it is enough to hold the grief at bay.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Remus says as he looks back at Molly. She\u2019s smoothing a hand down Ron\u2019s hair, then switches to Harry so that they\u2019re both equally showered with her affection. She watches Remus with a smile. \u201cYeah I suppose it\u2019s a bit like that.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sirius and Remus take Harry home much too late\u00a0that night \u2013\u00a0way past his bedtime. He whines when they tuck him in and he frowns in a way that makes his lightning scar shudder down his forehead. Remus runs his fingers down each bolt and hopes that to Harry this scar is just another part of him, a small, singular, painful part but not the entirety of who he is. Just like when Sirius had looked at him and said softly to Remus,<em> I barely see James and Lily anymore. Only Harry. </em>And it had felt like a release they hadn't known they needed. A permission.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Harry smiles sleepily at him. He snakes an arm out from under his duvet and holds Remus\u2019s hand. Remus smiles and clambers into bed next to him. Sirius follows, Harry sandwich between them like the wheel that turns the hands of a clock.<br><br>\u201cTell me the story of Babbity Rabbity again, Remy,\u201d Harry says, yawning.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Remus smiles and begins the tale, watching as Sirius and Harry\u2019s eyes droop and the fear he feels is only distant proof that he has something too precious to lose.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>When the next full moon arrives, Sirius doesn\u2019t ask. Instead, Remus is the one to gently touch his shoulder and say, <em> would you?\u00a0 </em>Slowly, Sirius nods. And after they drop Harry at the Weasley\u2019s, they leave together.\u00a0</p>\n<p>It\u2019s too dangerous to wander the woods yet, so they hurry into the bunker and lock the trapdoor behind them. Sirius looks around the large room, his eyes lingering on the claw marks and dried blood until his gaze lands back on Remus. He softens.<br><br>\u201cWhat now?\u201d he asks, as if their bodies don\u2019t already know the routine.\u00a0</p>\n<p>They take off their clothes and reveal their animal underbellies to each other. Their knees press together when they sit down on the cold, dirt floor. Remus can feel the pull of the moon in his bones. His toes already start to bend and crack. He pants and whines and shudders until he falls forward, his forehead on Sirius\u2019s shoulder. Sirius traces his spine, up and down, up and down, until it is all Remus can think. The single touch that reminds him he still has a body, that it\u2019s his for now and it will be his again.\u00a0</p>\n<p>And when he doesn\u2019t, when his body is disappeared and his mind has run with the moon \u2013 when the wolf takes over and is angry and searching and scared and hungry \u2013 Padfoot is there. And that is Remus\u2019s last coherent thought as he turns animal and falls into the soft, black fur that catches him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em> Padfoot is here.\u00a0 </em>\n</p>\n<p>When he wakes, it is to Sirius\u2019s soft voice.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cC\u2019mon love, there you go,\u201d he says as Remus feels a blanket wrap around him. Then he is levitated through the woods, his eyes barely open enough to peek at the sky, and deposited in the soft comfort of their bed. He hears Sirius clamber downstairs, then back up again.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cA pain potion, yeah?\u201d<br><br>He helps Remus sit up. Remus swallows the potion gratefully and looks at Sirius in the mid-morning light. It washes his face golden, his lips where he smiles and the dark curls of his hair twisted with leaves.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI didn\u2019t...\u201d He can\u2019t ask the question. Sirius looks... but who knows what <em> Remus</em>, what the wolf...</p>\n<p>Sirius leans forward. He presses a kiss to the corner of Remus\u2019s mouth. To his cheek. He tucks Remus\u2019s light hair \u2013 where it has grown slightly too long \u2013 behind his ear and lets his fingers linger there.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNo sweetheart, I\u2019m fine,\u201d Sirius says. And as he does, Remus realises he\u2019s fine too. Tired, maybe. His bones ache and the transformation will shudder up and down them for at least another day, but there are no permanent scars. The wolf had not turned on itself in loneliness, because for the first time in many years, it was not. It had pack.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI love you,\u201d he says to Sirius. He kisses him hard. He draws him into bed. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Life in their house and in their village continues on. It may not be quite the happily ever after they had expected, but it is enough.\u00a0</p>\n<p>One afternoon, Remus goes to visit Neris. His hands in his pockets, lanky tall and shoulders rounded. She welcomes him into her home with a smile as if she had been expecting him. Reaches up to pat his cheek as he smiles. Maybe she is always this welcoming to strangers. Maybe Remus is no longer a stranger who lives in an abandoned house on a shrouded lane.\u00a0</p>\n<p>As they sit for tea, Remus hands her jars of ointments and creams. If he had used a bit of magic here and there, well <em> nobody has to know Sirius, </em> he\u2019d argued as Sirius had laughed and riled him up \u2013 secretly pleased that his Moony was breaking rules once more. <em> Who knew arthritic joints were what it would take, hey, </em>Sirius had said.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>They take their tea in the front room, surrounded by fine china ornaments. Neris smiles at Remus in the space between a discussion about the weather and Gemma\u2019s latest boytoy, a Scottish lad who she is having an immense amount of fun with \u2013 and says gently, out of the blue \u2013\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cMy sister was a witch, you know.\u201d</p>\n<p>Remus sits back in his chair. The cup of tea in his hand sloshes slightly. He can feel the way he is gaping at Neris, his mouth open in stunned shock. He slams it closed.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI... That is...\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOh Remus,\u201d Neris laughs. \u201cDo you think there would be a war around us and we wouldn\u2019t know?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNeris... you <em> can\u2019t </em> know, it goes against... the safety...\u201d Remus can barely get his thoughts in order. The corner of Neris\u2019s lips twitch as she seems to hold back laughter at Remus\u2019s stumbling words. In her, Remus can see Gemma for perhaps the first time.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOh love, don\u2019t be naive. There are many of us out there that know about the world but don\u2019t participate in it. My sister was the only witch in our family and we were incredibly proud of her. We grew apart, naturally, but I loved her dearly.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Remus remembers Lily crying when another unopened letter to her sister was returned. For the first time, he thinks about the people who are left behind. And the people, like Neris, who don\u2019t let it make them hard. Only soft, only understanding.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat happened to her?\u201d He asks warily.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Neris smiles sadly. \u201cGwendolyn died, early in the war. Not a big hero. A casualty in a big roundup of... what do you call people like her? Mug... Oh yes, muggleborns. Her body was found in a house with a group of those poor darlings. They told me it was a gas leak, but I knew.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Her old, arthritic fingers trace the edge of her teacup as she looks at Remus.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSometimes when people die, an entire world mourns them,\u201d she says. Remus flinches. \u201cBut other times, other victims, it\u2019s quiet. And there are only one or two people who know what an incredible joy it was that they existed. My Gwen didn\u2019t change the world. But she lived beautifully and she died before her time. And for that, I suspect I share your sadness.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Remus reaches forward. He takes her hands in his.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou have a special boy there,\u201d Neris says. \u201cAnd a special partner. And special wards around your house and a very special, very small village that will close around you now. So don\u2019t hide away too much, Remus. You are home.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>When Gemma barges through the door after her shift at the shop, throwing off her apron in disgust, she tells Neris to stop <em>nattering to the poor boy </em>and that she\u2019s <em>taking Remus out for a proper drink. </em>Neris smiles and shoots a wink in Remus\u2019s direction, hurrying him out the door and into the night as if she hadn\u2019t just moved the world around him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>At the pub, Sirius is already there with Harry \u2013\u00a0who has mushy peas smeared all over his face and bounds over to Remus with an energy only evoked by too much fizzy drink. Sirius shrugs not even remotely apologetically.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Gemma buys him and Sirius a round with a sly smile in Sirius\u2019s direction and the declaration that <em> posh boy here can get the next three rounds. </em> Sirius takes his pint with a huff and stalks towards the dodgy jukebox, claiming that he needs to <em> bring some taste to this backwater village. </em>Harry follows with a doglike loyalty.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSo, how\u2019s it going with the two of you then?\u201d Gemma asks with a raised eyebrow.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou know,\u201d Remus shrugs, tracing the edge of his glass. The notes of an old song \u2013 one that James and Lily had danced to on the steps of Hogwarts as if the future was theirs, a memory the world may not know but Sirius and Remus <em> do </em> \u2013 starts to play. Remus smiles softly, watching as Sirius takes Harry\u2019s hand to dance with him.<br><br>Gemma makes a face. \u201cUgh, disgusting,\u201d she says over her pint. But her hand gently lowers to rest on his arm, and her eyes crinkle at the corner in a reluctant, welcome happiness. Friendship feels so warm and familiar. Remus had forgotten that.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI know.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>At Hogwarts, Remus knows that he had experienced happiness so singular he could bypass the moon to touch the stars. And he did touch them. Gladly. Irresponsibly. With a cigarette in one hand and the other stretched in the air like he was invincible. He had been wondrous and reckless with the knowledge that his scarred fingers would rarely get to dip into the sky.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Now, Remus has two feet on the ground. And the beautiful ordinary of it is what takes his breath away.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>The way Sirius still gets up in the middle of the night to make tea after a nightmare. And how his hands tremble. And how a gentle kiss to the back of his neck is all it will take for him to slump and the words to spill out of him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Or that Sirius knows, even after all this time, the place to tickle Remus that will elicit the loudest, highest squeak. That he will use it only once in front of Harry \u2013 but once is all it takes.<br><br>Or that Sundays are reserved for the Weasleys and that every burnt contribution they bring to the table is met with a loud cheer that has Sirius bowing extravagantly and Remus shaking his head with a resigned sigh.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Or that Remus knows how Neris takes her tea and her ointments. And how Gemma takes her beer and her men.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Or that Harry still delights in the small everyday bursts of magic \u2013 the dragons that bellow marshmallow fire in his cereal and the way that the sun creeps over the horizon in the morning to wash their backyard like a watercolour painting, the beauty of it so routine that it becomes perfectly ordinary for them to sit and watch it unfold in front of them.\u00a0</p>\n<p>They watch it now, their feet wrapped in fuzzed socks as the morning sun inches forward to reach their toes. Sirius clings to his coffee like it is his only salvation and Remus despairs at the state of Harry\u2019s pyjamas \u2013\u00a0already covered in honey. But it is perfect. It is theirs.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Once, Lily and Remus had sat out by the Great Lake and hid for a brief moment of respite from their rowdy friends. Her eyes had been a fierce green as she took in his tired, sloped shoulders. Her round, dimpled face framed by gentle, red bangs. Remus had loved her fiercely then, and she had loved him. They were soft with each other when not many people were.\u00a0</p>\n<p>And so as the water had lapped gently towards them and distant shouts of laughter echoed over the lake, Lily had put her hand over his scarred one like she could trace the constellations of them. And she had said, <em> you deserve to be happy, you know. </em> And he had replied, <em> I\u2019ll try. </em>Just like that.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He wishes she were here for one last sunrise. Just to see the way it would slip through her hair. Or reflect on James\u2019s glasses as they looked down at their son to marvel in the person they had created more beautiful than any watercolour.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Remus looks at Sirius and Harry now. At how Harry smiles and tugs Sirius into a game that has them running after each other, Sirius desperately trying to avoid sticky honey hands. How Harry\u2019s socks get wet with morning dew and he slips into the dirt, only to stand up with a laugh. Keep playing. Keep loving. Keep laughing. And how the sun wraps around the trees of the forest and sparks on the wards that protect them.</p>\n<p>Remus knows that if he lets the happiness of them \u2013 of Harry and Sirius and the sunrise and the stars \u2013 slip out of his hands, it will drain away like joy against a Dementor. So he clings on, somehow <em> still </em> hopeful, that happiness will continue to rise after every fall. That there is more joy to come, if he keeps his feet on the ground and his fingers reaching towards the sky.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Somewhere in the distance, Sirius laughs, \u201cOh c\u2019mon that\u2019s just cheating!\u201d There is a squeal as Sirius picks Harry up in retaliation and throws him over his shoulder. Then holds him above his head in the air.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cRemy, Remy, Remy!\u201d Harry screams with laughter. \u201cI\u2019m flying!\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>And so Remus picks himself up from the ground. He dusts his hands and looks to the sky once more, where Sirius holds Harry high enough to touch the stars.\u00a0</p>\n<p><em> I\u2019ll try</em>, he promises Lily as he walks towards his happiness, their black hair wild and faces lit ever golden by the morning sun. <em> I\u2019ll always try.\u00a0 </em></p>\n<p>\n<b>THE END</b>\n</p>\n<p>So the incredible <a href=\"https://twitter.com/VeloxVulpes3\" rel=\"nofollow\">@VeloxVulpes3</a> has done the most beautiful cover art for this fic, which I just had to share.
