  "summary": "<p>AU in which Yuuri still doesn\u2019t remember the banquet, somehow doesn\u2019t blow Japanese Nationals, runs into Victor at the World Championships, and has absolutely no idea why his idol is suddenly friendly and <em>incredibly</em> handsy.</p>\n<p>Does Yuuri care about his reasons? No. It\u2019s Victor Effing Nikiforov.</p>\n<p>Basically this is an excuse for total fluff. <strike>And porn.</strike> And shit-talking with bonus smut. (Edited for accuracy.) Happy birthday, Victor.</p>\n<p>~~</p>\n<p>Victor turned back to him, supernova smile in place once more. \u201cI really, really like you. Promise you\u2019ll still dance with me at the banquet if you take gold this time around.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yuuri stared at the man. He looked at their entwined hands\u2014he hadn\u2019t wanted to pull away\u2014and their thighs, pressed together despite there being plenty of room in the backseat of the cab. That scent of Victor\u2019s cologne\u2014just a dab, lightly applied somewhere on his neck\u2014swirled around him. This was too real to be a dream, too physical for him to have imagined it.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Yuuri said slowly. \u201cBut\u2026have we talked before?\u201d</p>",

  "text": "<p>\u201cYuuri!\u201d</p>\n<p>The hotel lobby was full, and Yuuri\u2014slinking against the wall, heading out to grab dinner on his own\u2014had no idea who was calling his name. Phichit hadn\u2019t arrived yet, and Celestino had plans with some other coaches.</p>\n<p>Who else did he know? A few people, yes, but talking to other skaters beforehand inevitably left him psyched out. Nothing good would come of having attention called to himself, not here. He\u2019d choked at the Grand Prix final; all he wanted was to put in a respectable showing at World\u2019s.</p>\n<p>The words came again. \u201cYuuri! Over here!\u201d</p>\n<p>Yuuri squinted into the center of the lobby, only to see Victor Nikiforov waving madly in his direction.</p>\n<p><em>What the hell?</em> Yuuri swallowed, his throat suddenly dry. Victor was smiling and gesturing, and for a moment, Yuuri felt his whole face heat. <em>Who, me?</em> He almost took an involuntary step forward, before reason asserted itself.</p>\n<p>No. Of course not him. Victor was probably talking to the Russian Yuri. Why would Victor effing Nikiforov have any idea who Yuuri was? He sighed and looked away.</p>\n<p>He managed to take three steps before someone grabbed his arm.</p>\n<p>\u201cYuuri,\u201d said Victor Nikiforov\u2019s voice in his ear, \u201cWhere are you going? I have been looking for you for hours.\u201d</p>\n<p>For a moment, Yuuri felt frozen in place. That was <em>Victor Nikiforov\u2019s</em> voice. He\u2019d heard it in interviews all too often. It seemed impossible that Victor\u2019s voice would be connected with the hand on Yuuri\u2019s elbow.</p>\n<p>Nothing was making sense. This was probably a dream. He was still on the plane. He\u2019d fallen asleep, and the food had disagreed with him, as it sometimes did. But he felt Victor\u2019s fingers dig into his elbow, and when he turned\u2026</p>\n<p>Victor Nikiforov. Victor fucking Nikiforov, with his heart-shaped smile and silver hair, beaming at Yuuri as if they had somehow become best friends.</p>\n<p>\u201cCongratulations on your win at the Japanese nationals!\u201d Victor\u2019s smile almost knocked Yuuri over with its enthusiasm. \u201cYou really did your program justice. And also, the bronze at the Four Continents\u2014great showing, even if\u2014never mind, we can talk about that later tonight. I almost went to the Four Continents, you know, but Yakov was screaming at me about pushing the difficulty of my short program, and I couldn\u2019t miss the practice. Sorry I wasn\u2019t there to cheer you on.\u201d</p>\n<p>Cheer him on? What the hell was this? Yuuri pinched himself, but even though this was definitely a dream\u2014an incredibly realistic dream, one where Victor was standing so close that Yuuri could smell the faint splash of some spicy, heady cologne\u2014he didn\u2019t wake up.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnyway,\u201d Victor said, as if this were all completely normal, \u201cof course you\u2019re coming to dinner with us, right? I can\u2019t believe I didn\u2019t get your number.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHuh?\u201d It was the only word Yuuri could think of.</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell me you already ate.\u201d Victor sighed. \u201cToo bad; you\u2019re still coming along. We need to catch up.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWho is us?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMe, Yuri Plisetsky, Mila, Christophe, Emil\u2026? Probably some others. It\u2019s a huge group. I told them I\u2019d wait for you in the hotel lobby and meet up with them as soon as I found you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yuuri had known that Victor Nikiforov was a force of nature. This was the first time, though, that he\u2019d experienced it in person\u2014that broad smile, the bright sunshine of his personality bearing down on him.</p>\n<p>\u201cUh\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCome on, I\u2019m starving.\u201d Victor gave Yuuri a wink that suggested a great deal more than physical hunger\u2014no, no, Yuuri\u2019s rational brain protested, don\u2019t project your own wants on him\u2014and before Yuuri knew what was happening, entwined their hands together and started marching out the door.</p>\n<p>Dream. This was a dream. There was no way this was anything except a dream, because Victor was <em>holding his hand</em> and <em>hailing a cab</em> and, as they piled into the backseat, Victor\u2019s thigh pressing into him close, too close, he was <em>handing him his phone</em> and demanding that he put his number in.</p>\n<p>Yuuri did so with shaking hands. Victor then proceeded to send him an SNS. <em>It\u2019s Victor. Not getting away again so easily.</em></p>\n<p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d Victor asked. \u201cYou seem a little subdued. Jet lag?\u201d</p>\n<p>Yuuri looked over at him. \u201cUh\u2026 Well\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>Victor\u2019s face changed subtly. \u201cOh. It\u2019s me. I\u2019m babbling too much. That\u2019s it, right? I\u2019m babbling. Oh, God, you have no idea\u2014my rinkmates make fun of me all the time, I\u2019m a nervous babbler, I have been kicking myself for the last months for not getting your number, but of course if we\u2019d been exchanging SNS this whole time I wouldn\u2019t be so nervous.\u201d</p>\n<p>The night was going from strange to surreal. \u201c<em>You\u2019re</em> nervous?\u201d Yuuri squinted at Victor. \u201cWhy are you nervous? You\u2019re Victor fucking Nikiforov.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI watched all your programs,\u201d Victor confessed in a low voice. \u201cYou\u2019re brilliant. I adore you. I honestly think if you had a clean skate, you could beat me, you know.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cRidiculous.\u201d Yuuri stared at him. He pinched himself again with his free hand through his jeans. He still wasn\u2019t waking up.</p>\n<p>\u201cYour program components score could wipe me out. And I know you\u2019re landing the quad Salchow in practice all the time now, so if you could do it in competition\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cRidiculous,\u201d Yuuri repeated more emphatically.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd you have more stamina than any skater I\u2019ve seen,\u201d Victor concluded. \u201cHonestly, your free skate doesn\u2019t take enough advantage\u2014but oh, God, I\u2019m babbling again.\u201d Victor looked up at the ceiling. \u201cShut up, Victor; he doesn\u2019t want to hear you critique his free skate program.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yuuri shook his head in bafflement, and then Victor turned back to him, supernova smile in place once more.</p>\n<p>\u201cI really, really like you. Promise you\u2019ll still dance with me at the banquet if you take gold this time around.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yuuri stared at the man. He looked at their entwined hands\u2014he hadn\u2019t wanted to pull away\u2014and their thighs, pressed together despite there being plenty of room in the backseat of the cab. That scent of Victor\u2019s cologne\u2014just a dab, lightly applied somewhere on his neck\u2014swirled around him. This was too real to be a dream, too physical for him to have imagined it.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Yuuri said slowly. \u201cBut\u2026have we talked before?\u201d</p>\n<p>Victor looked at him. Slowly, that brilliant smile faded from his face. He turned away. \u201cOuch.\u201d</p>\n<p>The word came out lightly. But\u2026Yuuri could have sworn the man was actually hurt, which made no sense.</p>\n<p>\u201cAh, damn.\u201d Victor\u2019s hand pulled from his. \u201cDamn. That\u2019s\u2026 No, no, it\u2019s fine. I get it. Is it Christophe? Or do you have someone else at home?\u201d</p>\n<p>Yuuri swallowed. \u201cNo,\u201d he said slowly. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t. It\u2019s just, I just\u2026 I\u2019ve looked up to you for a really long time, you know? And at the Grand Prix final, you didn\u2019t even know I was a fellow competitor.\u201d</p>\n<p>Victor winced. \u201cNo. You\u2019re right. I didn\u2019t realize it until the banquet. I\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t realize that bothered you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yuuri bit his lip.</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course it bothered you,\u201d Victor said, a little more steadily. He gave a short nod, as if coming to a decision. \u201cDamn, I should have got your number then, and we could have worked this out before now. I was just so blown away at the time, I couldn\u2019t even think.\u201d</p>\n<p>The strangest thing about this conversation was that it didn\u2019t feel strange. It should have felt intrusive, to have Victor this close to him. To have his fingers play across Yuuri\u2019s wrist. It absolutely should have felt unnatural when Victor tapped Yuuri\u2019s chin, tilting it up, looking into his eyes.</p>\n<p>Instead, it felt right. As if all of Yuuri\u2019s life up until this moment had been hummed subtly off key, and the moment Victor walked up to him and took his hand, the melodies asserted themselves as they should be.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Victor said. \u201cThis is more complicated than I imagined. Let me make it up to you?\u201d</p>\n<p>His eyes were blue layered on gold. His mouth tilted up in a smile, and that damned cologne\u2026</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, no,\u201d Yuuri said. \u201cThat\u2019s not necessary.\u201d</p>\n<p>The cab stopped. They\u2019d arrived.</p>\n<p>Victor tapped his thumb against Yuuri\u2019s lips. \u201cOh,\u201d he said softly. \u201cBut it <em>is</em> necessary. If I\u2019ve upset you in any way, I intend to make it right.\u201d</p>\n<p>#</p>\n<p>The evening continued in that same bewildering vein. Victor insisted on paying the driver. He locked his hand in Yuuri\u2019s, and then conducted him to the second floor of a crowded restaurant, where all the top men\u2019s figure skating competitors were already seated around a table laden with dishes.</p>\n<p>\u201cVictor!\u201d They were, of course happy to see him; Yuuri expected that. But\u2026</p>\n<p>\u201cYuuri!\u201d said Cristophe Giacometti. \u201cThe man of the hour. I see Victor\u2019s already laid claim to you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yuuri had never been the man of the hour. For that matter, he\u2019d never been the man of the <em>minute.</em></p>\n<p>But Victor\u2019s hand tightened around Yuuri\u2019s almost possessively. \u201cDon\u2019t answer,\u201d he said lightly. \u201cChristophe is just being a jerk.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTch,\u201d said Yuri Plisetsky from down the table. \u201cI can\u2019t believe you found him and brought him here. You know he\u2019s just going to flub his jumps.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYuri,\u201d Christophe said patiently, \u201cwhen you enter the senior division, you\u2019ll discover that it\u2019s not just about how high you jump, it\u2019s about the motion you make while doing it. I\u2019d explain more, but you\u2019re still a minor, and I do have <em>some</em> standards.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yuuri choked.</p>\n<p>\u201cTry to be polite,\u201d Victor said to the other Yuri, \u201cunless you want to settle things with a dance off?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, sick burn,\u201d said Leo de la Iglesia, and for some reason, the Russian Yuri seemed to think that this baffling comment was, in fact, a sick burn, because he flushed red and muttered something under his breath about <em>cheating</em> and <em>next time </em>and <em>disgusting.</em></p>\n<p>Victor pulled Yuuri down to sit next to him. \u201cIgnore Yuri,\u201d he said. \u201cWe all do.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHey, asshole, I\u2019m right here! I can hear you!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s just jealous because you have more artistry when you fall on a jump than he has when he makes them.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBitch, I know where you live!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI love you too, Yuri.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThis is too confusing,\u201d said Mila. \u201cI knew this would happen. We can\u2019t have two Yuris at the table. Yuri Plisetsky, from here on out, you\u2019re Yurio.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat the hell? That\u2019s not my name. And I was here first! Shouldn\u2019t <em>he</em> be called Yurio?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, if you want to dance for it\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>For some reason, that baffling interjection left the entire table, except Yuuri, cackling\u2014and Yuri Plisetsky frowning and muttering imprecations under his breath. Rinkmates and their inside jokes, he supposed.</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you sure you should be using that kind of language?\u201d Mila said with a shake of her head. \u201cYou\u2019re awfully young for it, Baby Yuri.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not baby Yuri, you hag, and\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it past your bedtime?\u201d Victor said.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s <em>not even eight,</em> I hate you all, just wait until I enter the senior division, I will <em>kick your asses so hard, </em>yes, even you, Mila, I don\u2019t have to be directly competing against you to <em>destroy you forever.\u201d</em></p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s loud,\u201d Victor whispered in Yuuri\u2019s ear, \u201cbut we love him. Don\u2019t take anything he says seriously. He only yells at people he respects. He\u2019s like a kitten, pouncing on anything that moves.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yuuri blinked, remembering that time a few months back in the bathroom. Respect? He looked over at the Russian Yuri\u2014Yurio.</p>\n<p>Yurio glared at him. \u201cYou\u2019re gonna suck in your short program. Both of you. You and Victor. You\u2019re both going to suck. I will be the only Yuri left standing. I will <em>eat your skates.\u201d</em></p>\n<p>\u201cHuh,\u201d Yuuri said. \u201cRespect.\u201d And after that, he began to relax.</p>\n<p>#</p>\n<p>Victor fed him dessert.</p>\n<p>That wasn\u2019t even the weirdest part\u2014Victor ordering tiramisu, holding up a bite on his fork, and leaning toward Yuuri, teasing him until he opened his mouth and let the delicious treat dissolve on his tongue.</p>\n<p>The weirdest part was that nobody else at the table seemed to think this was weird. Mila didn\u2019t gasp. Christophe just smiled. Emil just shrugged, as if it were absolutely normal for Victor to grab skaters he barely knew from the hotel lobby and then feed them dessert.</p>\n<p>The only person who expressed any opinion at all was Yurio. \u201cGet a room, you two,\u201d he snarled.</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d Victor said casually. \u201cI have one.\u201d</p>\n<p>Did Victor do this so often that nobody even blinked an eye at it? How many of his fellow competitors had he seduced this way? Yuuri had a Google alert set for Victor\u2019s name, and in all the gossip that swirled about the man, he\u2019d never heard of anything like <em>this. </em>He really ought to have.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, maybe Victor left his conquests so satisfied that they didn\u2019t dare complain.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnother bite,\u201d Victor whispered.</p>\n<p>\u201cSorry.\u201d Yuuri felt his cheeks flush. \u201cI have to compete in a few days. And it\u2019s very good, but dairy doesn\u2019t always agree with me\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>The smile slid off Victor\u2019s face. \u201cOh, damn. I should be sorry. I should have asked. There\u2019s a flourless chocolate cake; I can get that instead?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy should you have asked? You were ordering for yourself.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2026\u201d Victor shook his head. \u201cBut\u2026 Ah, well. It\u2019s a couple miles back to the hotel. Want to walk back with me?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUh\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>Victor grinned and tilted his head at the rest of the crowd. \u201cThey\u2019ll be taking cabs. I want you all to myself, if you don\u2019t mind.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yuri agreed in a helpless daze.</p>\n<p>Victor was <em>good</em> at seduction. He probably had a long line of conquests. His friends were used to him deciding on a different nobody every time. They were so used to it, they didn\u2019t even comment. And for some unknown reason, Victor Nikiforov had decided that Yuuri would be next in that line.</p>\n<p>Yuuri should have been offended.</p>\n<p>Instead\u2026 He couldn\u2019t help thinking that this meant that he could have Victor\u2019s full attention, even for just this evening.</p>\n<p>Stupid Victor. Yuuri had been seduced by him years ago. He hadn\u2019t needed tiramisu or dinner or a walk together to make him give in. He\u2019d just needed Victor.</p>\n<p>If Victor wanted to walk him back to the hotel and whisper sweet nothings in his ear the whole way, Yuuri planned to let him.</p>\n<p>He planned to let him do everything.</p>\n<p>#</p>\n<p>Victor did not whisper sweet nothings.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou know what I don\u2019t understand?\u201d Victor said, as they walked hand in hand along the boulevard. \u201cI don\u2019t understand why you don\u2019t win more.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yuuri felt himself flush. \u201cI do. It\u2019s because I\u2019m not as good as you. You don\u2019t have to flatter me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not flattering you,\u201d Victor said impatiently. \u201cYou have the skills to win. Your artistic interpretation is better than mine, and I\u2019m as arrogant as they come, so if I\u2019m admitting it, it <em>must</em> be true. You don\u2019t get tired easily, and while you can\u2019t land a quad flip or a quad loop yet, I\u2019ve seen you in practice, and you\u2019re pretty consistent with the toe loop and the Salchow. You should have placed at the Grand Prix final a few months ago.\u201d</p>\n<p>When had Victor ever seen him in practice? Yuuri blanked out, until he remembered the little segment that had aired a few weeks ago. It\u2019s not like anyone could get a sense of him from that highly edited piece, anyway. It felt frankly bizarre to know that Victor must have seen that one video Japanese media had made of him practicing, after he\u2019d won the national competition. Where else Victor would have seen him, Yuuri had no idea. It felt even more bizarre to have someone else echo his most arrogant thoughts, the ones he was afraid to even let himself think.</p>\n<p>\u201cCome on,\u201d Yuuri said. \u201cThis is embarrassing. My total score at the Grand Prix final was a hundred points below yours, you know, and\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd it shouldn\u2019t have been,\u201d Victor said passionately. \u201cWhat was going on?\u201d</p>\n<p>Yuuri swallowed. \u201cMy\u2026my dog died the night before the competition.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, no. I\u2019m so sorry. I would have been devastated.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI was stressed because of the pressure, and\u2026\u201d He couldn\u2019t make himself look at Victor. \u201cAnd on top of all that, I suppose\u2026 I suppose I lack confidence. I always have.\u201d</p>\n<p>Victor didn\u2019t say anything to that. He just kept hold of Yuuri\u2019s hand as they walked, swinging it gently. Yuuri glanced over, to see the other man biting his lip pensively.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not new,\u201d Yuuri said. \u201cI\u2019ve always been like this. No matter how prepared I am physically, I\u2019m mentally weak.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMmm.\u201d Victor nodded. \u201cIt\u2019s a little surprising to hear you say that. But it explains a lot. Is that why your free skate program is\u2026like that?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLike what?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell.\u201d Victor swung their hands as they walked. \u201cIt\u2019s safe. Even your short program is a little too safe, but I was especially wondering about your free skate program. Why are your biggest jumps in the first half?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, my coach thought, since I have difficulty landing in competition\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYour <em>coach</em> put your jumps in the first half?\u201d Victor was beginning to look angry.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes. He choreographs all my programs.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s ridiculous. You don\u2019t have a problem landing <em>jumps.</em> You have a problem being confident. And when your <em>own coach</em> gives you a program that says that <em>even he</em> does not believe you are capable of landing jumps, that just undermines you yet again. You know what I would do, if I were choreographing your program?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUm. What?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI would give you three quads. Maybe four. I\u2019d put them all in the back half of the program, because you can do it. I\u2019d push up the difficulty level by twenty points\u2014no, don\u2019t frown\u2014and when you looked at me like that, I would tell you in no uncertain terms that I believed you could do it. Because I do.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yuuri swallowed. He wasn\u2019t sure what this feeling inside him was. It was something strange, something he couldn\u2019t quite wrap his head around.</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you\u2026just telling me this so that I\u2019ll rearrange my program and mess it up?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy would I do that?\u201d Victor asked. \u201cFirst, I like you. I wouldn\u2019t screw you like that. Second, it makes no sense. You can\u2019t beat me with your program as it is now. You can\u2019t even come close. You\u2019re not competition, not like this. But you could be.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yuuri looked over at Victor. In the moonlight, his hair shone like silver. He had a smile on his face\u2014a mocking, taunting smile. He was still holding Yuuri\u2019s hand.</p>\n<p>\u201cI skate best when I\u2019m challenged,\u201d Victor whispered. \u201cChallenge me, Yuuri.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m supposed to meet Yakov at nine tomorrow morning for practice,\u201d Victor said. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you what. Meet me on the ice at seven, and we\u2019ll go over your short program together. I <em>did</em> tell you I\u2019d make up for not recognizing you as a competitor, didn\u2019t I?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFine,\u201d Yuuri said. \u201cFine. I\u2019ll meet you.\u201d</p>\n<p>For a while, they didn\u2019t say anything. The evening was crisp, not cold, and the lights were beautiful. They walked, holding hands, leaning into each other. Victor\u2019s hand enveloped his. He didn\u2019t just hold it; he ran his thumb up and down Yuuri\u2019s palm as they walked, and after a little bit, Yuuri responded, caressing him back.</p>\n<p>He\u2019d never been a conquest before. He didn\u2019t know if he should keep the fact of his virginity to himself, because it might inconveniently spoil the mood, or if he should mention it to explain his inevitable fumbling inexperience.</p>\n<p>Victor brought him up to his room. Yuuri rescued his room key from the jumble in his pockets and opened the door. Thank God he was naturally neat; he\u2019d put away most of his equipment in the hotel drawers already.</p>\n<p>Victor just smiled languidly down at him.</p>\n<p>\u201cAren\u2019t you going to come in?\u201d Yuuri asked.</p>\n<p>To his surprise, Victor just leaned down until their noses brushed. His lips tasted Yuuri\u2019s for the barest of instants.</p>\n<p>\u201cIf I come in,\u201d Victor said, \u201cwe\u2019re not likely to sleep, are we?\u201d</p>\n<p>Yuuri felt himself blush fiercely.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re skating early in the morning. Better not.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh.\u201d Yuuri tried to tamp down the stab of disappointment.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd besides,\u201d Victor said, \u201cI want to savor this. We have plenty of time, don\u2019t we?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2026do?\u201d He\u2019d thought that they would have a night. Maybe, if they were enthusiastic, it would spill into a morning. But apparently, Victor was thinking they might spend all of the World Championships doing\u2026whatever this was. Maybe that\u2019s why Chris had called Yuuri the man of the hour.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe do,\u201d Victor said.</p>\n<p>Oh, what the hell. Yuuri was already blushing. He\u2019d reached peak embarrassment a while back; it couldn\u2019t get any worse. \u201cVictor?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMmm?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI still might not sleep.\u201d</p>\n<p>For some reason, Victor grinned in delight at this confession. \u201cI know,\u201d he said, brushing Yuuri\u2019s cheek with his hand. \u201cMe neither, I\u2019m so happy. But we should try.\u201d</p>\n<p>#</p>\n<p>On the ice, Victor was all business.</p>\n<p>\u201cHere,\u201d he said seriously, handing Yuuri a paper cup with a cardboard sleeve. \u201cI went over your short program from the Four Continents.\u201d He pulled out a list he\u2019d made of Yuuri\u2019s jumps. \u201cWere you planning on the same difficulty this time around?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUm, no. My coach changed this triple flip to a triple loop, and\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?! He <em>lowered</em> the difficulty for Worlds?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, as it was, I was\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s ridiculous,\u201d Victor said. \u201cDoes he <em>not</em> want you on the podium? Does he not think you can make it?\u201d</p>\n<p>Yuuri lowered his head. \u201cHe said if I skated well, I might end up\u2026top ten?\u201d It sounded arrogant to even admit that he thought he could do such a thing.</p>\n<p>Victor emitted something like a low growl. \u201cYou made the Grand Prix finals this year, and he thinks you should <em>maybe</em> shoot to end up in the top ten? Oh, no he didn\u2019t. I will track him down, and\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cVictor, please stop. It\u2019s okay. I just\u2014he wants what\u2019s best for me, he\u2019s thinking of my weakness, and next year\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s not thinking at all,\u201d Victor groused. \u201cDoes he understand this sport? There is no next year. No next competition. There\u2019s only the one you\u2019re in right now. One injury, one skating accident, and there is no future. You take what you have, when you have it, and you give it your all. Or what\u2019s the point in doing it?\u201d</p>\n<p>Yuuri swallowed. Good advice, and for more than just skating.</p>\n<p>\u201cJump higher. Move faster. Land better. That\u2019s the only way you\u2019ll move forward. Now tell me what you think you can do.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yuuri looked at the page before him. He could see the choreography in his mind, imagine himself speeding up this section here just a hair\u2026 The music would actually support that.</p>\n<p>\u201cTriple flip,\u201d he said, tapping a jump. \u201cA quad loop here. Switch this double and this quad Salchow for the points.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGood,\u201d Victor said. \u201cKeep going.\u201d</p>\n<p>And so he did. They spent an hour rearranging his short program, Victor making him practice sections over and over until he had the flow down.</p>\n<p>\u201cThere,\u201d Victor finally said. \u201cI think you can practice on your own. Any advice for me?\u201d</p>\n<p>Yuuri looked over at him. \u201cVictor. How could <em>I</em> advise <em>you?</em> That\u2019s\u2026 That\u2019s just nuts.\u201d</p>\n<p>Victor raised an eyebrow. \u201cIs it? You\u2019ve never had one critical thought about my short program? Not once? Or have you not watched it?\u201d</p>\n<p>Yuuri felt himself flush. Well. As it turned out\u2026</p>\n<p>Victor leaned in. Brushed Yuuri\u2019s cheek with his finger. \u201cTell me what you\u2019re thinking, Yuuri.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s nothing, really, it\u2019s nothing. But, you know, just a few things. On the part where you come out of the Ina Bauer\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>Last night, Yuuri had thought that nothing would be more seductive than Victor feeding him tiramisu. This morning, he\u2019d revised that thought\u2014nothing was more seductive than Victor facing him with the megawatt power of his star smile, telling him that he was <em>going</em> to land that quad Salchow at the end, that he <em>expected</em> him to do it.</p>\n<p>He had been wrong yet again. Victor asking him for advice\u2014as if he were an equal, not a skating mortal compared to a god\u2014and then <em>taking it\u2014</em>that was the most seductive of all.</p>\n<p>Yuuri was fairly certain that he wasn\u2019t going to survive this championship intact. He was just as certain that he didn\u2019t want to. He wanted this\u2014all of this\u2014for as long as Victor would have him.</p>\n<p>#</p>\n<p>\n<em>Yuuri, dinner tonight?</em>\n</p>\n<p>The SNS came at about three PM\u2014after Yuuri had finished his own practice session with his coach, ignoring the man\u2019s flat looks as he worked Victor\u2019s adaptations into his program.</p>\n<p>Celestino had been more than a bit taken aback. \u201cYuuri, are you sure? This seems terribly ambitious. You should skate a program geared to your abilities.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yuuri had thought of Victor telling him that there was no competition but the one he was in. \u201cI\u2019m sure,\u201d he had said.</p>\n<p>He was sure of this, too. <em>My rinkmate is also in town for world\u2019s,</em> he wrote back. <em>Is it okay if he comes along?</em></p>\n<p>\n<em>Okay! It was my friends last night, so it\u2019s only fair. As long as I get you to myself for a little while. </em>\n</p>\n<p>#</p>\n<p>\u201cYuuri,\u201d said Phichit halfway through dinner, when Victor had temporarily excused himself, \u201chow is it that you failed to mention that you were <em>dating Victor effing Nikiforov?\u201d</em></p>\n<p>Yuuri found himself blushing. \u201cShut up, Phichit. We\u2019re not dating.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, you\u2019re just <em>holding his hand</em> and letting him <em>kiss your knuckles</em> and tell you that you\u2019re <em>ravishing </em>in that color for no reason?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not like that,\u201d Yuuri started. But he stopped himself. \u201cOkay, it\u2019s exactly like that. But the way I see it is, um\u2026\u201d He trailed off.</p>\n<p>\u201cUm.\u201d Phichit scowled at him. \u201c<em>Um</em> is not nearly enough explanation. Spill it, girl.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not dating,\u201d Yuuri finally said with a sigh. \u201cVictor just walked up to me yesterday at the hotel, took my hand, and announced I was going to dinner with him. I think he just\u2026decides on someone he\u2019s going to seduce for the tournament or something?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd you just went along with it?\u201d</p>\n<p>Yuuri flushed. \u201cWhat was I going to say? \u2018Victor, I\u2019ve been fantasizing about you for years, please don\u2019t touch me?\u2019 Of course I went along with it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCongratulations,\u201d Phichit said in awe. \u201cYou big slut. I\u2019m so proud of you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI was a little taken aback at first,\u201d Yuuri confessed. \u201cIt was the weirdest thing. Suddenly, he was like my best friend\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cI\u2019m your best friend.\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, of course you are,\u201d Yuuri said hurriedly. \u201cBut he knew my skating programs and everything. He even brought me tea this morning\u2014and he got his hands on genmaicha, which <em>I </em>haven\u2019t been able to find here! How did he <em>know </em>that\u2019s what I drink in the morning? Honestly, I would have been satisfied with him knowing my name. But no, Victor Nikiforov seduces the way he skates\u2014like I\u2019m the only thing in the world, and nobody stands a chance.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s good, then?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe actually\u2014um, we\u2026 We actually haven\u2019t\u2026 That is to say, I\u2019m\u2026still a virgin.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yuuri heard a choking noise behind him and turned rapidly. Victor was standing behind him, his eyes wide.</p>\n<p>Oh. No.</p>\n<p>\u201cUm. Victor. Hi! How long have you been\u2026um\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019d be satisfied with my knowing your <em>name?\u201d</em> Victor sounded incensed. \u201cWhat the <em>hell.\u201d</em></p>\n<p>\u201cPhichit. You <em>knew</em> he was there.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, yes, but\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNever mind,\u201d said Victor, sitting down next to Yuuri. \u201cIt\u2019s fine, that\u2019s fine. What were we talking about before I left?\u201d</p>\n<p>#</p>\n<p>It wasn\u2019t fine. Yuuri couldn\u2019t quite figure out why Victor kept shooting him dark looks. He didn\u2019t <em>want</em> him to have expectations, did he? Yuuri was a virgin, not an idiot. Celebrities didn\u2019t just become miraculously handsy with their biggest fans because they wanted a long-term relationship. That\u2019s not how this worked.</p>\n<p>Victor shared a cab back to the hotel with Phichit and Yuuri, though, scarcely touching Yuuri.</p>\n<p>He walked Yuuri to his room, his hands clasped together behind his back, his eyes dark and stormy. And when Yuuri paused there, wondering if he was even going to get a kiss tonight, Victor turned to him.</p>\n<p>\u201cFor the record,\u201d Victor said, \u201cI found an interview with you from three years ago that said you had a cup of genmaicha in the morning. So I ordered some online when I was in Russia and brought it along this trip, on the off chance that you might share a room with me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yuuri swallowed, shaken.</p>\n<p>\u201cI know your name,\u201d Victor said. \u201cI know your hometown. I know what your parents do for a living. I know you majored in linguistics at college, I know your birthday is November 29th, and I know that you used to have an adorable poodle named Vicchan.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yuuri found himself blushing.</p>\n<p>\u201cI know that nobody in the world believes in you the way I do. You changed my life at the Grand Prix banquet. You were the brightest, most beautiful thing I had ever seen. Go ask any of my rinkmates\u2014Georgi, Mila, Yuri. Go ask Christophe or Emil; they were with me at the European championships. I have literally not stopped talking about you since that moment.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yuuri didn\u2019t know what to do with this confession. It made no sense. He\u2019d gone to the banquet, hid against the wall, and drank himself into a stupor of regret and sorrow. How the hell had Victor even noticed him? Why had he even cared? Did Victor have a soft spot for despairing, failing drunks?</p>\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d he said stupidly.</p>\n<p>\u201cI redid the choreography for my short program after that banquet so it was about meeting you. I redid my free skate so that it was about missing you,\u201d Victor said. \u201cAnd I will be <em>damned</em> if you watch me skate tomorrow and imagine that I\u2019m thinking of anyone but you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yuuri shook his head, unsure what to do with this.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou deserve someone who thinks you can make all your jumps,\u201d Victor said. \u201cAnd Christ, really? You\u2019d let me take your virginity just because I knew your goddamned <em>name? </em>Have some standards.\u201d</p>\n<p>It was really too much. How was Yuuri supposed to understand any of this? Victor was the inexplicable genius, the one who made up his mind to have something and pursued it. Yuuri just wanted to be pursued, dammit.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s my virginity,\u201d he said quietly. The words still seemed forceful. \u201cI can give it up to anyone I want, any way I want, for whatever reason I want. It\u2019s not like I\u2019ve lacked opportunity before now.\u201d</p>\n<p>Victor paled. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean it like that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI <em>have</em> standards,\u201d Yuuri said. \u201cHigh standards, if you want to know the truth. Here\u2019s the biggest one: I didn\u2019t want to have sex with someone when I knew I was going to be imagining you the entire time. It\u2019s not that I\u2019ve been waiting for someone to know my name. I\u2019ve been waiting for someone who could make me forget <em>yours.\u201d</em></p>\n<p>It was Victor\u2019s turn to stare at him stupidly. \u201cOh,\u201d Victor finally said. \u201cOh.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFor the record, my poodle, Vicchan? He\u2019s named after you.\u201d</p>\n<p>A third time: \u201cOh.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m going to demolish you in the short program tomorrow,\u201d Yuuri heard himself promise. In the back of his mind, he could hear his more careful self screaming. <em>No, no, Yuuri, what are you doing? Why are you challenging Victor Effing Nikiforov, of all people, to a skate off?</em> \u201cAnd when I do, Nikiforov, you\u2019re coming back to my room, and this time, you\u2019re coming in. And you\u2019re going to do exactly as I say. Do you hear me?\u201d</p>\n<p>Victor\u2019s eyes glowed. \u201cLoud and clear, Katsuki. But if <em>I</em> outperform you, you\u2019re coming back to <em>my</em> room, then. And don\u2019t think I\u2019ll let you off easily. Now that I know the truth, you\u2019re never getting away.\u201d</p>\n<p>#</p>\n<p>Victor had a suite on the top floor of the hotel, one that was almost the size of the apartment Yuuri had shared with Phichit in Detroit. Victor poured out glasses of bubbly water with a squeeze of lime\u2014\u201cWe shouldn\u2019t drink mid-competition,\u201d he murmured as he passed the flute to Yuuri\u2014and pointedly did not look in the direction of the bedroom.</p>\n<p>Instead, Victor sat on the couch.</p>\n<p>\u201cA quarter of a point,\u201d Yuuri said. \u201cA quarter of a point between us, and you had to get another world record, didn\u2019t you? I would have beaten you in any other competition.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBest PCS score I\u2019ve ever achieved,\u201d Victor said, \u201cand it\u2019s all your fault, Yuuri. You\u2019re adorable when you sulk. Come here anyway. Aren\u2019t you supposed to do as I say?\u201d</p>\n<p>Yuuri\u2019s heart was beating hard. \u201cYes. Of course. What\u2026what do you want with me?\u201d He hoped they started slow. Kissing. Maybe moving to blow jobs or something. As excited and willing as he was, he didn\u2019t know if he could just jump right into the hardcore stuff\u2026</p>\n<p>Victor patted the seat on the couch next to him, and Yuuri came to sit next to him. Their thighs touched. Victor draped his arm around him.</p>\n<p>\u201cYuuri,\u201d he said, \u201cdo you know what\u2019s coming next?\u201d</p>\n<p>Yuuri had some idea. There was porn, after all, and even without porn\u2014which Yuuri suspected was probably overblown, since it didn\u2019t seem possible that people who had not taken ballet were that bendy on a regular basis\u2014there were plenty of articles online covering everything from blowjobs to rimming to anal.</p>\n<p>Yuuri flushed. \u201cI\u2019m a virgin,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I\u2019m a virgin with internet access. I have some idea.\u201d</p>\n<p>Victor just grinned at him. \u201cYou have <em>no</em> idea, because <em>I</em> get to tell you what we\u2019re doing tonight. Tonight, we\u2019re looking at pictures of Makkachin.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yuuri tilted his head. \u201cMakkachin. Your <em>dog?\u201d</em></p>\n<p>Victor retrieved a tablet from the table. \u201cMy dog,\u201d he said. \u201cThe best dog, the most wonderful dog. Here\u2019s Makkachin when he was a puppy. Oh my god, this picture\u2014one of my favorites\u2014Makkachin chewed the laces off my skates\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>Victor showed him pictures of St. Petersburg, his dog, his competitions, his dog, his rinkmates, his <em>dog</em>\u2026</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m saving the best for later,\u201d he told Yuuri, turning off his phone as the Victor on his camera roll started looking more and more like his present-day self. \u201cIt\u2019s your turn.\u201d</p>\n<p>So Yuuri shared his pictures in return\u2014Vicchan, when he was a puppy, then Hasetsu, Mari and her pictures with Vicchan, his time in Detroit, a road trip with Phichit to the Grand Canyon.</p>\n<p>It was ten by the time they finished.</p>\n<p>\u201cSleep with me?\u201d Victor asked. \u201cAnd I do mean sleep. Because we\u2019re getting up early to go over your free skate program, you know. Just because there\u2019s a day off between programs doesn\u2019t mean we can rest. How else are you going to get me back to your room to have your way with me?\u201d</p>\n<p>Yuuri shouldn\u2019t have been able to sleep, not after that. Especially not after he stripped down to his underwear and borrowed one of Victor\u2019s shirts. Not when he climbed into bed and Victor threw an arm around him, pulling him close. Not when his heart beat with excitement at Victor\u2019s proximity. But Victor pressed a kiss against his forehead and\u2026</p>\n<p>And it really had been a long day, starting with morning practice, and ending with the short program event.</p>\n<p>\u201cGood night,\u201d he said.</p>\n<p>\u201cGood night.\u201d</p>\n<p>#</p>\n<p>\u201cWake up, sleeping beauty.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yuuri frowned and turned over. He had no idea where he was. What he was doing. The room seemed large, and the clock read five in the morning. What the hell. He managed an incoherent groan.</p>\n<p>\u201cCome on,\u201d Victor said, \u201cwhat are you waiting for? Up, up, up. Time is wasting.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh my god.\u201d Yuuri buried his head in the pillow. \u201cYou\u2019re a morning person.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMmm. I made you tea.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yuuri turned his head. Yes. Tea. He reached out and took a hold of the cup and inhaled. \u201cNice.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cVery nice,\u201d Victor said. \u201cAnd I have breakfast, because we need to go practice.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPractice? At five in the morning?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Victor said. \u201cHow else will we get through both of our free skate programs together?\u201d</p>\n<p>#</p>\n<p>It turned out that Victor was an absolute madman at practice. They spent two hours refining Yuuri\u2019s program, pushing, pushing, pushing until Yuuri was ready to scream. Then they started talking about Victor\u2019s, and for some reason\u2026</p>\n<p>For some reason, Yuuri had opinions, and today, he wasn\u2019t afraid to use them. \u201cLook,\u201d he said, \u201cthat step sequence\u2026 You can do so much better than that, you\u2019re not using your <em>hips,</em> see, if you\u2019d push off like this\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>Victor Nikiforov, four-time world champion, was listening to him. He was taking Yuuri\u2019s advice. He was using it, and his program was getting better for it.</p>\n<p>By the time Celestino arrived at the rink, sometime around nine thirty, Yuuri had discovered that he was actually better at spins. Better. At spins. Then Victor Effing Nikiforov.</p>\n<p>Victor didn\u2019t bother to deny it, either.</p>\n<p>#</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s too much,\u201d Celestino was saying five hours later. \u201cYou\u2019re missing your last jumps, and you know that you always underperform under pressure, Yuuri. I know you have some idea that you can put together a technical program that\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>He stopped as another skater came to an abrupt halt next to them in a spray of ice. Yuuri looked over. It was Yurio\u2014small and angry, like a tiny bristling mountain lion. His hands clenched into fists and he glowered up at Yuuri. \u201cSo are you coming to lunch with us or not?\u201d he demanded.</p>\n<p>\u201cUm\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYuuri still has to practice,\u201d Celestino said. \u201cHe\u2019s flubbing his jumps\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Of course </em>he\u2019s flubbing his jumps,\u201d Yurio said with a roll of his eyes. \u201cFirst, he\u2019s an incompetent <em>idiot</em> of a skater who I expect will crash <em>every single fucking landing tomorrow,</em> and second, he hasn\u2019t eaten since five thirty this morning. What kind of a moron tries to do quad toe loops when he\u2019s so hungry his hands are shaking?\u201d</p>\n<p>Celestino looked at Yuuri\u2019s hands. \u201cOh,\u201d he said in surprise. \u201cReally? I thought\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI got here a few hours early,\u201d Yuuri explained.</p>\n<p>\u201cIn that case\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>Celestino left, and Yuuri was left to look at Yurio. The boy just rolled his eyes. \u201cNot only are <em>you</em> an incompetent idiot, your <em>coach</em> is an incompetent idiot. Everyone knows that if you practice jumps when you\u2019re worn out you\u2019ll just learn to do them wrong.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUh. Thanks?\u201d</p>\n<p>Yurio shrugged this off. \u201cWe\u2019re meeting outside the locker room in ten minutes. Don\u2019t think we\u2019ll wait for you, moron.\u201d</p>\n<p><em>We</em> turned out to be the Russian contingent once again\u2014Georgi, Mila, Anya, Yuri, and Victor. Victor\u2019s eyes lit up when he saw Yuuri.</p>\n<p>\u201cYuuri! You\u2019re coming to lunch with us?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI was kind of dragged into it,\u201d Yuuri said, and Victor captured his hand again.</p>\n<p>They found a small cafe near the rink. The waiter had just delivered bread and drinks, when\u2026</p>\n<p>\u201cSo,\u201d Mila said, \u201cVitya, did you finally get laid?\u201d</p>\n<p>Victor spat out his drink.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh my God,\u201d Anya said. \u201cYou\u2019re right. He did! Congratulations on the sex, you two!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShut up!\u201d Yurio snapped, turning bright red. \u201cThere are minors present! Think of my innocent ears.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yurio was not the only one blushing. Yuuri could feel his face heating. His whole <em>body.</em> Of course, of course everyone assumed they\u2019d had sex. They <em>slept</em> together. They were holding hands.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re cute together,\u201d Georgi said. \u201cNot as cute as me and Anya, but still cute.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI apologize,\u201d Victor said to Yuuri. \u201cMy friends are terrible. Truly terrible.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo, Yuuri, have you called him Vitya yet?\u201d Mila practically cooed.</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you even know about Russian forms of endearment?\u201d Anya said. \u201cVictor <em>wants</em> you to call him Vitya, you know.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOnly if he wants to,\u201d Victor said, in a voice that sounded suspiciously like a whimper, \u201cand\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut how will he even know if you don\u2019t tell him? In fact, that\u2019s good advice for just about everything in the bedroom.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGah.\u201d Yurio shook his head. \u201cStop it, all of you. Stop this stupidity <em>this very instant</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou know who gets to talk about my sex life?\u201d The tips of Victor\u2019s ears were red, almost as if he were embarrassed. Yuuri found that particular shade of pink fascinating. He hadn\u2019t thought that it was possible to embarrass Victor. He was older\u2014four years older\u2014and more experienced, and for God\u2019s sake, he was one of the hottest bachelors around, and a worldwide heartthrob. But he was blushing.</p>\n<p>\u201cEveryone who landed a quad flip in practice, that\u2019s who gets to talk about my sex life,\u201d Victor concluded.</p>\n<p>Yurio slammed a fist on a table. \u201cNo fair! I\u2019m not even allowed to do quads yet!\u201d</p>\n<p>Victor turned to him. \u201cI thought you didn\u2019t want to hear this, let alone talk about it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI <em>don\u2019t,</em> but that doesn\u2019t mean you can <em>tell me what to do. Suck it, </em>you bag of dicks.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh no,\u201d Mila said, \u201cYuuri is blushing, too.\u201d She turned to him, which made Yuuri blush even more. \u201cI know you just got here, and we don\u2019t really know you, and it must seem really mean to tease you like this.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cEhhh\u2026\u201d Yuuri managed.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry if we\u2019re making you feel uncomfortable. I like you. I just didn\u2019t think you were the kind of person to be phased by this kind of thing. You know, you\u2019re the confident, assertive, type.\u201d</p>\n<p>Confident? <em>Assertive?</em> What the hell was even happening? Had the entire group somehow confused him with JJ Leroy?</p>\n<p>\u201cIf you only knew how many <em>years</em> of shit-talking we have had to put up with from Victor,\u201d Georgi said sadly, \u201cyou would understand.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo many years.\u201d Mila sighed. \u201cSo much shit.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo <em>many</em> fucking years,\u201d said Anya. \u201cThe payback is real.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d said Yuuri, his face burning. \u201cIt\u2019s okay. It\u2019s kind of funny.\u201d And it was. They were teasing Victor, but there was a lot of love in it. And he didn\u2019t get the impression that Victor <em>minded. </em>He was blushing, yes, but also\u2026it was cute. \u201cI guess you\u2026don\u2019t have to stop.\u201d</p>\n<p>Victor frowned at him. \u201cDid you land a quad flip in practice, Yuuri? No? Then I don\u2019t think you can say anything, either.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHuh,\u201d Yuuri said. Somehow, being around people who thought he was <em>confident</em> and <em>assertiive</em> made him feel\u2026more secure. Which is probably why he heard someone say, in his own voice, \u201cbut I don\u2019t think you really thought that rule through.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHmm?\u201d</p>\n<p>Yuuri\u2019s face was so hot he could have cooked an egg on it. Still, though\u2014Yuuri wasn\u2019t sure how\u2014he found the nerve to arch a brow in Victor\u2019s direction. \u201cIf I can\u2019t talk about your sex life,\u201d he said, \u201chow will I tell you what to do later tonight?\u201d And then he clapped a hand over his mouth, because holy <em>crap </em>how had those words come out of there?</p>\n<p>\u201cOh my God!\u201d Mila waved her hands excitedly. \u201cVictor, I think I love him.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s the shit-talking boyfriend that Victor deserves!\u201d declared Georgi.</p>\n<p>Victor didn\u2019t say anything about that <em>boyfriend,</em> didn\u2019t disclaim it, didn\u2019t say that this was just for the competition.</p>\n<p>\u201cFuck you all!\u201d growled Yurio. \u201cThere are <em>children</em> present. Will someone please think of the goddamned children?\u201d</p>\n<p>Victor just looked at Yuuri with brilliant, shining eyes, as if he had said the best thing ever.</p>\n<p>\u201cFine,\u201d Mila said. \u201cFine. We\u2019ll be nice to you, Vitya. We won\u2019t tease you hardly at all. I mean, it\u2019s not like this is <em>funny</em> or anything.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay, but can we please not stop yet?\u201d Anya interjected. \u201cStory time. You know who I talked to today? Phichit Chulanont.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d said Georgi, \u201cPhichit! Our man Phichit.\u201d</p>\n<p><em>Their man</em> Phichit? \u201cUm. I didn\u2019t know you guys knew Phichit.\u201d In fact, Yuuri was pretty sure they <em>didn\u2019t.</em> Phichit hadn\u2019t said anything at dinner or at practice. Hell, Phichit had never mentioned anyone at this table, and he was such a gossip that he <em>would</em> have.</p>\n<p>Anya waved a hand. \u201cVictor made us all follow him on Instagram and Vine so we could talk about you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Um. \u201cWhat? How?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHow are you so dumb?\u201d Yurio glared at him. \u201cOf course we follow Phichit! How do you think we all know how you skate in practice, you cow-brained moron? It\u2019s not like you ever post anything on social media. Dimwit!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo anyway,\u201d Anya said, brushing off these baffling revelations as if they were nothing, \u201cI sort of accidentally on purpose went over to adjust my laces next to him at the side of the rink? He was taking pictures of Vitya talking to Yuuri.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d Yuuri said, wincing. \u201cOh dear.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd I may have wondered aloud if they\u2019d, um\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh.\u201d Yuuri squeezed his eyes shut.<em> \u201cDear.\u201d</em></p>\n<p>\u201cSo Phichit dropped the biggest bomb. He said something about Yuuri having fifteen posters of a certain <em>someone</em> on his wall.\u201d</p>\n<p>Victor\u2019s ears turned a brighter red.</p>\n<p>Yuuri felt his entire face heat. \u201cI do not.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, too bad,\u201d Victor said. \u201cI thought that sounded\u2026sweet.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yuuri looked up to see Victor fighting a smile. Not a mean smile or a triumphant smile. A giddy, brilliant smile, the smile of someone who was as delighted in Yuuri as Yuuri was in him. It was a strange and beautiful feeling. He had no idea what was happening, or why, but somehow, some way, Victor Nikiforov had figured out that Yuuri <em>existed,</em> and he seemed to like him despite having personal knowledge of his shortcomings.</p>\n<p>Maybe that was why Yuuri finally gave in. \u201cIt\u2019s not fifteen,\u201d he admitted with a sigh. \u201cIt\u2019s seventeen. Eighteen, if you count the framed photo on my bedside table.\u201d</p>\n<p>Mila let out a little shriek. \u201cThis is the cutest World Championship ever. Vitya, you\u2019re going to be so happy. And I am going to give you <em>so much shit</em> for it.\u201d</p>\n<p>#</p>\n<p>\u201cI honestly have no idea what is going on,\u201d Yuuri said later that night, when they\u2019d retreated to Victor\u2019s room. \u201cAnd that is, to put it bluntly, the mildest way I can express myself. I walked into the hotel thinking, don\u2019t choke, don\u2019t choke, maybe try to talk to one new person. The next thing I knew you were dragging me to dinner and suddenly all your friends are telling me how confident and cute I am. What is even happening?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUm.\u201d Victor insinuated his hand in Yuuri\u2019s. \u201cI didn\u2019t think this was hard to figure out. You\u2019re currently in second at the World Championships.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, and what the <em>hell</em> is that?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re currently in my room,\u201d Victor said.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhich makes absolutely no sense. You\u2019re Victor fucking Nikiforov.\u201d</p>\n<p>Victor just smiled and brought up Yuuri\u2019s hand so he could kiss it. \u201cAnd you\u2019re Katsuki fucking Yuuri. You <em>are</em> cute. I think you\u2019re beautiful, and fun, and one of the best skaters I\u2019ve known. Honestly, if you perform your free skate like you did in practice, you can beat me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s another thing,\u201d Yuuri muttered, yanking his hand away. \u201cYou have this idea that just because I <em>can</em> do this program, I <em>will. </em>You seem to think I\u2019m on your level.\u201d</p>\n<p>Victor reached out and took his hand back. He turned it over, tracing little figure eights on his palm. \u201cYuuri. How are you not on my level? You are literally 0.24 points away from me after I set a world record on my short program.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat was an accident,\u201d Yuuri said baldly. \u201cThis whole thing is an accident. It feels like you\u2019re confusing me with someone else.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat <em>was</em> your short program score? 115.81?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, but\u2026 That was seriously an accident! I was so focused on impressing you in the short program that somehow, I never got anxious. But tomorrow is different, and you seem to think I\u2019m this confident person. I\u2019m not. I\u2019m mentally weak. I have been my entire career. That\u2019s why I\u2019ve never matched you. That\u2019s why I never will.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMentally weak.\u201d The figure eights on Yuuri\u2019s palm turned into three-point turns. \u201cWhat do you mean, you\u2019re mentally weak?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI get anxious.\u201d The words sounded ugly when Yuuri said them aloud, confessing the worst part about him to the person he most wanted to impress. \u201cMy heart races. My hands get clammy. My skates feel like they weigh forty pounds. Sometimes I can barely even see, and it\u2019s not just because I take my glasses off, you know? My anxiety is so bad that I have a prescription for it. Sometimes, if I\u2019m not in training, I\u2019ll use it just so I can get through the day. But it\u2019s not safe to skate and take the medication. So.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh.\u201d Victor\u2019s arm came around him.</p>\n<p>Yuuri didn\u2019t understand why Victor was <em>holding</em> him when he\u2019d just confessed his worst secret.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo there you are,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s what happened at the Grand Prix final. You seem to have this idea that I\u2019m this confident, brilliant skater, and one of these days, you\u2019re going to figure out that you\u2019re not. Ask Yurio\u2014he found me crying in the bathroom afterward.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe told me,\u201d Victor said absently.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2014what? You knew?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMmm.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou knew, and you win <em>everything,</em> everything all the time, and\u2026and\u2026you\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMmm,\u201d Victor said again. \u201cHe told me, and I thought\u2026 Oh. Maybe Yuuri will understand.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yuuri blinked. He <em>didn\u2019t</em> understand. Victor was the champion of everything; how could Yuuri\u2019s weakness connect them? But he was beyond protesting.</p>\n<p>And Victor looked at their interlaced hands and shook his head. \u201cMy parents died when I was ten. I had just started to achieve success as a skater. They left me a little money. I fell to the care of my uncle, though. He didn\u2019t think much of skating, but when I said I wanted to keep on under Yakov, he shrugged and said I could do so until the money from my parents ran out.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yuuri held his hand, and held his breath.</p>\n<p>\u201cSkating is expensive,\u201d Victor said. \u201cThere are coaching fees, rink fees, housing. You know. Then there are costumes and choreography. My parents left me enough for one year. One year of skating, that was all I had. If I wanted to keep going, I was going to have to win prize money. A lot of prize money.\u201d Victor shrugged. \u201cFor the first three years, I\u2026 I couldn\u2019t afford to miss a podium at a competition. I told everyone I was doing my own choreography because I knew myself best, but the truth is I needed to do it to save money.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yuuri tilted his head. Victor was still idly stroking his palm, but he was looking off in the distance. There was something almost vulnerable about him. This was not the Victor Nikiforov Yuuri had seen in interviews, always confident, always sure of himself.</p>\n<p>\u201cI almost ran out of money three times. There was a point where it was so close I had to sell my extra set of skates. I pawned my medals.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, no.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI got my first sponsorship when I was thirteen, and things mostly improved after that. But those three years\u2026 I had all these nights where I\u2019d stay awake, think of the bills I had to pay, knowing that I\u2019d lose my entire world if I messed things up.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d Yuuri said softly. \u201cVitya. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd of course you know the Victor Nikiforov story after that. Things turned around, and once I started winning everything in juniors, I got real sponsorships and advertising money. But once you\u2019ve got in the habit of worrying, it\u2019s hard to stop. I know it\u2019s irrational, but I always feel like I\u2019m one loss away from disaster.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yuuri leaned his head against his shoulder.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhen I joined seniors, it took me a while to start winning again. Maybe, I think, my first few seasons were terribly inconsistent because I had to prove to myself that I <em>could</em> lose. That it was allowed. That I could make a mistake and not have my world collapse around me. I had to learn that I could lose before I could start winning again. So, yes, Yurio told me about your crying in the bathroom, and I thought\u2026maybe you would understand.\u201d</p>\n<p>It was strange. Victor Nikiforov was not a god. Yuuri had begun to realize that before, but this was proof. He was\u2026human, and somehow all the sweeter for it.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re Victor,\u201d Yuuri said. \u201cI didn\u2019t expect you to be\u2026<em>this,</em> too.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat,\u201d Victor said, \u201ca giant liar? Everyone always talks about how effortless my skating is. What they don\u2019t know is that it\u2019s hard every time. I just can\u2019t let anyone know how hard.\u201d</p>\n<p>They didn\u2019t say anything for a while after that. They sat on the couch, holding hands, holding each other, Yuuri feeling his world shift in the best possible way. He had never been able to believe that Victor Effing Nikiforov would take an interest in him for anything except a meaningless fuck. But Victor\u2014<em>this</em> Victor\u2014might.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s interesting, what you told me about anxiety,\u201d Victor said. \u201cYou said you were mentally weak, and I\u2019m curious why you think that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUh,\u201d Yuuri said, \u201cbecause sometimes I stop breathing, miss all my jumps, and land in rock bottom?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s not what I heard,\u201d Victor said. \u201cYour anxiety is serious enough that you\u2019ve been prescribed medication, which you can\u2019t take if you want to skate. And yet you qualified for the Grand Prix final. You won your national championship. You\u2019re here at the World Championships, in second place after the short program, behind only the four-time World Champion, Victor Nikiforov.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cEnh, but\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019ve accomplished the exact same thing that I\u2019ve accomplished in this competition, except you did it with anxiety,\u201d Victor said. \u201cYou\u2019re not mentally <em>weak. </em>You\u2019re so strong that you can outskate everyone else here wearing forty pound skates.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2014but\u2014that is\u2014\u201d Yuuri frowned. Nobody had ever put it quite like that.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd you thought that telling me this would make me like you <em>less?\u201d</em></p>\n<p>\u201cUm. Yes?\u201d</p>\n<p>Victor\u2019s fingers curled, hooking around Yuuri\u2019s, pulling him close. Their noses brushed, and Yuuri inhaled. There it was\u2014that hint of cologne, bringing with it a wave of rising interest.</p>\n<p>\u201cWrong,\u201d Victor said. And he kissed Yuuri.</p>\n<p>Somehow, in the whirlwind of the last few days, in that weird space where Victor acted like he <em>knew</em> Yuuri, where their friends all thought they had banged\u2026 Somehow, Yuuri himself had forgotten that they\u2019d barely kissed, and that only once.</p>\n<p>He remembered it now. Remembered it as Victor pulled an arm around his waist, dragging him close. He remembered it far too well as their mouths came together, lips and tongue tasting each other. The touch was light at first, and then\u2014as they grew used to the idea of each other\u2014deeper, <em>more.</em></p>\n<p>Victor shed his shirt first. Skating left little room for fat on the body; Yuuri ran his hands down Victor\u2019s chest, touching the rippling muscle, down his abdomen, and then up.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, God,\u201d Victor whispered. \u201cThat\u2019s nice. So nice.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yuuri touched him again, and again, growing bolder with every caress. He dared to thumb Victor\u2019s nipples, and was rewarded with a heavy gasp when he did.</p>\n<p>\u201cLet me,\u201d Victor said. \u201cLet me touch you, too.\u201d</p>\n<p>And so he did. There were a few moments of overwhelming shyness\u2014when Victor unsnapped his jeans, when Yuuri slid his hands up Victor\u2019s thighs for the first time.</p>\n<p>The first time when Victor stroked the length of his erection through his underwear.</p>\n<p>\u201cNice,\u201d Victor said.</p>\n<p>Yuuri shut his eyes. \u201cDo it again.\u201d</p>\n<p>The warmth of Victor\u2019s touch shot through him, an electric bolt spearing him from one end to the other.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s almost midnight,\u201d Victor said.</p>\n<p>\u201cMmm. Do it again.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe free skate is tomorrow,\u201d Victor said. \u201cAnd\u2026 I\u2026 I hate to be rational and everything, but\u2026we need to stop.\u201d</p>\n<p>Damn it. Damn it. Damn it. Yuuri exhaled, burying his face in Victor\u2019s shoulder. \u201cOkay,\u201d he muttered. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSleep with me?\u201d Victor asked, casually.</p>\n<p>The shirt Victor loaned Yuuri smelled like him. It didn\u2019t matter that the bed was soft and the room was dark. It didn\u2019t matter that he\u2019d worn himself out in practice. Yuuri could feel Victor\u2019s presence close, so close. It was different, now that he knew what he looked like. What he tasted like. What his hand felt like, running the length of his erection.</p>\n<p>Now Yuuri knew how close Victor was, and now he wanted him.</p>\n<p>He forced himself to lie in place, teeth gritted, ordering his mind to stop conjuring up images of Victor\u2019s chest, the bulge in his underwear. He had to fall asleep. The free skate was tomorrow. If he tossed and turned, he\u2019d disturb Victor.</p>\n<p>He had to go to sleep. He had to. Too bad his erection had another idea entirely. By the clock in the room, the minutes ticked by slowly. One. Two. Ten. He was still thinking about Victor. About what Victor had done to him, what he wanted to do back. Twelve. Fifteen.</p>\n<p>God, they hadn\u2019t even taken off their underwear. This was a bad, bad sign.</p>\n<p>Twenty.</p>\n<p>\u201cYuuri,\u201d came Victor\u2019s voice, gentle in the dark. \u201cYou can\u2019t sleep, either?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI, um.\u201d</p>\n<p>Victor rolled over. Close to him, warm and oh, softer than he\u2019d have imagined.</p>\n<p>\u201cI think,\u201d Yuuri said carefully, \u201cI should probably go to my room.\u201d Where he could rub one out and sleep without Victor to distract him.</p>\n<p>\u201cMmm. Maybe. But I\u2019d miss you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Victor\u2019s hand was on his bicep, and\u2026</p>\n<p>And that part of Yuuri, the confident part, the assertive part, the one that had teased Victor earlier, that had promised to tell him what to do\u2026 That part came to life.</p>\n<p>\u201cOr,\u201d Yuuri heard himself say, \u201cif you\u2019re having the same problem I am, I could help you take care of yourself.\u201d</p>\n<p>There was a long pause. Then a low moan. \u201cYuuri. You\u2019re going to kill me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Yuri said. \u201cI won\u2019t.\u201d He slid closer to the man. \u201cI\u2019m going to make you feel really, really good.\u201d</p>\n<p>He wasn\u2019t sure what had got into him, but he leaned down and kissed Victor\u2019s neck.</p>\n<p>\u201cAhhh.\u201d</p>\n<p>He was so responsive. So interested. Victor gasped underneath him, and Yuuri took pleasure in it.</p>\n<p>He found his nipple with his tongue. Felt the man jolt, his arm go around him.</p>\n<p>\u201cThere,\u201d Victor said. \u201cThat. Do that. Do you mind\u2026?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Yuuri said. \u201cDo it. Can I touch with you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes.\u201d The word was hot, urgent, whispered in his ear. \u201cYes, I want you to touch.\u201d</p>\n<p>So the first time Yuuri touched Victor\u2019s cock was in the dark. With his lips on the man\u2019s chest, his body pressed against him, his own erection hard against Victor\u2019s hip. He let his hand slide on top of the other man\u2019s, let himself get used to the rhythm of Victor\u2019s strokes, the way he liked to pause at the end, the way his breath came undone as he came closer.</p>\n<p>\u201cYuuri,\u201d Victor said. \u201cYuuri. You\u2019re so perfect.\u201d</p>\n<p>Nobody had ever thought Yuuri was perfect before. Victor came with a growl, his hand speeding up.</p>\n<p>It was probably the hottest, most wonderful moment in his entire life. He\u2019d done that\u2014he\u2019d taken apart Victor Nikiforov, world heartthrob. He\u2019d made him come.</p>\n<p>And then the next moment was hotter. \u201cYour turn,\u201d Victor said, turning to him. \u201cCan I\u2026?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d Yuuri said. \u201cYes. Everywhere. Anywhere.\u201d</p>\n<p>He wouldn\u2019t have thought that Victor would be tentative about this, but he was at first. Kissing him. Touching him. Sliding his hands down Yuuri\u2019s abdomen as if he were trying to memorize him.</p>\n<p>\u201cThere,\u201d Yuuri said. \u201cTouch me there.\u201d He was touching himself, firm, strong strokes. He\u2019d touched himself before, but this, <em>this, </em>with Victor\u2019s hands on him, his mouth on him, magnifying everything\u2026 This was more. Bigger. Harder. Better.</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you like this?\u201d Victor asked.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThis?\u201d His lips kissed their way down Yuuri\u2019s chest.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Yes.\u201d</em></p>\n<p>\u201cThis?\u201d Down his abdomen.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d Yuuri was chanting. \u201cYes. <em>Yes.\u201d</em></p>\n<p>\u201cAnd this?\u201d His lips touched the end of Yuuri\u2019s penis, interrupting his strokes, and Yuuri didn\u2019t care, didn\u2019t care at all, it was so hot, so perfect.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d Yuuri said. \u201cYes, yes, oh fuck, yes, more, please, please don\u2019t stop, god. I\u2019m going to come. Victor. Victor. There.\u201d</p>\n<p>Holy shit. Holy shit. Everything was different, and still the same. The bed was still soft. The room was still dark. Everything was warmer, though, and Victor was cuddled against him.</p>\n<p>\u201cWas that okay?\u201d Victor\u2019s voice was breathless.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh my god,\u201d Yuuri heard himself say. \u201cMore than okay.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGood.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt was the best,\u201d Yuuri said. \u201cThe absolute <em>best.\u201d </em>He yawned. \u201cVictor, you better fucking skate like hell tomorrow because if I win, I am coming for your ass.\u201d</p>\n<p>For a moment, there was silence. Then he realized what he had said\u2014oh, God, what would Victor think? Had he really said that out loud?</p>\n<p>\u201cWell,\u201d Victor finally said, \u201cthat\u2019s convenient, because if <em>I </em>win, you\u2019ll be coming for my ass, too. But since we both need to sleep\u2026maybe now is not the time to work ourselves up about it.\u201d</p>\n<p>#</p>\n<p>They could hear the commentators from the podium.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s Victor Nikiforov, silver medalist, giving the gold medalist, Katsuki Yuuri, a hug.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, you know, sometimes these close matches can turn into rivalries, but we saw Katsuki and Nikiforov in practice earlier today. It looked like they were actually working through each other's programs together. There\u2019s a real friendship there.\u201d</p>\n<p>Friendship. Yes. It was that, all of that, and\u2026</p>\n<p>\u201cHonestly, I\u2019ve been trying to get the inside scoop on that,\u201d said one of the other commentators. \u201cApparently, they met at the Grand Prix final earlier in the season, and hit it off really well. There\u2019s some kind of story there, but nobody\u2019s really talking\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>Oh, skating gossip. Always the furthest thing from the truth. Yuuri couldn\u2019t help but smile. If they knew the <em>real</em> truth of the Grand Prix\u2014that Victor hadn\u2019t even known who he <em>was\u2014</em>they\u2019d probably be as baffled by this turn of events as Yuuri himself.</p>\n<p>And yet somehow, he was here. On the podium. Standing above Victor. Who had promised to do anything he wanted if he won.</p>\n<p>Yuuri wasn\u2019t entirely sure what he\u2019d done to deserve this, and part of him was still convinced that he was going to wake up at any moment, but\u2026</p>\n<p>Well, if this was a dream, he was going to enjoy it to the utmost.</p>\n<p>\u201cCongratulations,\u201d Victor said from his place on the podium just beneath Yuri. \u201cSo what exactly am I going to be doing tonight?\u201d</p>\n<p>Yuuri smiled. But for the first time that night, his anxiety started to assert himself. What the hell had he been thinking? <em>You\u2019ll do whatever I say</em>. Haaaa. This was Victor Nikiforov, international heartthrob, hottest man alive. And he was supposed to do what Yuuri wanted? Yuuri was supposed to put what he wanted <em>in words?</em></p>\n<p>This\u2026 This was not going to go well.</p>\n<p>He managed a shaky smile. \u201cI\u2019ll think of something.\u201d</p>\n<p>#</p>\n<p>They didn\u2019t say much on their way up to Yuuri\u2019s room. Their eyes met in the elevator, and in Yuuri\u2019s gut he felt something like excitement mixed with nausea.</p>\n<p><em>We\u2019re doing this.</em> And also: <em>Oh, fuck, what are we even doing?</em></p>\n<p>Victor met his gaze calmly, as if he expected <em>Yuuri</em> would have it all under control.</p>\n<p>Yuuri was not quite in a blind panic by the time they got to his room, but he was close. His heart pounded heavily in his chest. He\u2019d already started to imagine Victor laughing at him\u2014God, Victor somehow thought he was hot, and he was actually quite ordinary, and this was all a mistake and Victor was going to realize it\u2026</p>\n<p>He opened his door, pulled Victor in, and pushed up for a kiss in something like a blind panic.</p>\n<p>Victor set his fingers on Yuuri\u2019s lips. \u201cWait. Before we start, I have\u2026 Can I just tell you something first? I\u2019m not going back on anything. I want to do\u2026everything. But\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>But everything was already going wrong, and Yuuri could do nothing to stop it. \u201cOf course,\u201d Yuuri said.</p>\n<p>He had no couch in his room, just a bed. They sat, and Victor took out his phone. \u201cThe other night, I showed you pictures of St. Petersburg and my dog and my home and\u2026 And I skipped some of the most important pictures to me. Can I show you them first?\u201d</p>\n<p>Anything to put off Victor\u2019s inevitable disappointment. \u201cSure.\u201d</p>\n<p>Victor thumbed his phone open and brought up his camera roll, navigating into a folder. His face was pink, and gently\u2014nervously, Yuuri thought, why would Victor be nervous?\u2014he handed over his phone. \u201cHere. Start here.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yuuri was looking at his own face, flushed and arrogant, right up in the lens of the camera. He frowned.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat? What\u2019s this?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFrom the Grand Prix banquet, of course,\u201d Victor said shyly. \u201cI\u2026 I don\u2019t know if you noticed, the way my rinkmates were teasing me at lunch the other day. But\u2026 It turns out\u2026\u201d His voice dropped. \u201cYou\u2026 You aren\u2019t the only one of us that\u2019s a virgin.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?! But how\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCrushing desperation about losing when I was younger,\u201d Victor said, \u201cfollowed by\u2026well, a lot of work, and the fact that every time I got close to someone, I\u2019d hear nothing but, oh, you\u2019re so bruised, you should take a break\u2026 Pfft. I didn\u2019t want to have sex with someone who didn\u2019t understand me, and that meant I was looking for someone who understood skating.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut you\u2019re Victor Nikiforov, hottest man alive,\u201d Yuuri said blankly.</p>\n<p>Victor gave Yuuri a shallow grin. \u201cI did tell you I was a liar. And, you know, the other night, after our bet about the short program, when I showed you pictures of Makkachin?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cActually, that was really fun.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI wanted to do more,\u201d Victor said. \u201cBut I chickened out. Deep down, I was actually\u2026kind of glad you won tonight. It took the pressure off me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut you\u2019re an international heartthrob,\u201d Yuuri said. \u201cReporters have written articles about your love affairs.\u201d</p>\n<p>Victor ducked his head. \u201cSorry I got mad at you the other day when I lectured you about standards for giving up your virginity thing. It wasn\u2019t my place to criticize.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d Yuuri pulled him close.</p>\n<p>\u201cI just wanted to think that when I gave up mine, it would mean something to you. I wasn\u2019t trying to tell you what to do, or how you should think. I honestly don\u2019t care what your past is. I wanted you when I thought you were a playboy.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWait, you thought I was a playboy?\u201d Yuuri frowned. \u201cWhere the hell did you get that idea?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe banquet at the Grand Prix final, duh.\u201d Victor gestured to his phone. \u201cWe got sidetracked. I was telling you how I saw it. Where were we? Right. I was waiting for the right person. And then you walked up to my rinkmates and me, drunk off your ass, at the banquet.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yuuri blinked and looked down at the image of himself on the phone. There he was, bright red\u2014<em>stupid</em> Asian flush\u2014and definitely drunk off his ass, gesturing with a champagne bottle. \u201cI did <em>what?\u201d</em></p>\n<p>Victor didn\u2019t notice Yuuri\u2019s disbelief.</p>\n<p>\u201cI know,\u201d he said with a soft chuckle. \u201cYou walked up to us, looking as hot as <em>that.</em> And you said, \u2018Yuri Plisetsky, you little shit, if you think you\u2019re better than me than take me on in a dance battle.\u2019\u201d</p>\n<p>Victor thought he looked hot? \u201cI said <em>that?\u201d</em></p>\n<p>\u201cIt was so great.\u201d Victor gave a happy sigh. \u201cAt first, I tried to calm things down between the two of you. But you looked at me and said, \u2018Just because you have a great ass does <em>not</em> mean I\u2019m going easy on you. Just try me, Victor.\u2019\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, God. No. I said that? At a banquet? In front of everyone?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt was my favorite thing that has ever happened at any banquet anywhere.\u201d Victor was flipping happily through photos on his phone. \u201cHere,\u201d he said, \u201chere, this is the point right here when I asked you who you were, and you said, \u2018It\u2019s Katsuki Yuuri, and you <em>better not </em>forget my name again.\u2019\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m dead, I\u2019m dead.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt took me\u2026 Maybe fifteen minutes?\u201d</p>\n<p>Victor flips through the photos, burbling delightedly about Yuuri and how much fun he had. There is actual proof that this all happened, even though Yuuri has no memory of it. But there he is, pawing at the ground and making fake horns at Victor, who\u2019s flapping his jacket at him as if it were a red cloak.</p>\n<p>\u201cThere,\u201d Victor said. \u201cThere. That\u2019s the exact moment when I knew I wanted it to be you.\u201d</p>\n<p>More photos\u2014Yuuri dipping Victor, grabbing hold of his thigh. Oh, holy shit. Was that a <em>pole? </em>Was Yuuri in his <em>underwear?</em> In front of all the skating officials? How had anyone let this happen? Why hadn\u2019t anyone stopped him?</p>\n<p>\u201cHere,\u201d Victor said, his voice getting thick. \u201cIn the photo before, I knew I <em>wanted</em> it to be you. This? This is the moment when I knew I <em>needed</em> it to be you. I knew that nobody else in the entire world would do. I wanted your hands on me. Your thighs against mine. Your mouth\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh my god.\u201d Yuuri put his head in his hands.</p>\n<p>Victor pulled away and contemplated him. \u201cIs that shallow? I guess it sounds shallow. I mean, you\u2019re incredibly hot, but it wasn\u2019t just that, it was, it was this beautiful connection, you see? Tell me you felt it the way I did. Just a little bit.\u201d</p>\n<p>The man looked so hopeful. Yuuri couldn\u2019t bear to break his heart. But he couldn\u2019t bear to lie to him either.</p>\n<p>\u201cVictor,\u201d Yuuri said. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I was so incredibly drunk. I don\u2019t remember <em>any</em> of this.\u201d</p>\n<p>There was a long pause. Victor\u2019s face went blank. \u201cYou\u2026don\u2019t\u2026remember.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI remember going to the banquet. Glaring at you. Drinking. Staggering up to my room, and waking up with a splitting headache.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWait.\u201d Victor stood. \u201cSo you thought I just walked up to you in the hotel lobby, having never spoken to you before, and demanded you come to dinner with me?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPretty much,\u201d said Yuuri. \u201cThat\u2019s how it happened.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhen you told me that we hadn\u2019t really spoken before, that\u2019s what you meant. You weren\u2019t trying to put me in my place. You meant that you literally believed that we hadn\u2019t spoken before.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUh, basically that.\u201d</p>\n<p>Victor paced across the room, shaking his head. \u201cThen my friends all told you that you were confident and assertive, and you didn\u2019t think that was weird?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt did seem pretty weird, honestly. I told you that. You didn\u2019t believe me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI told you about stalking Phichit\u2019s instagram for news of you, and you didn\u2019t wonder <em>why?\u201d</em></p>\n<p>\u201cI <em>did</em> wonder why. Honestly, it seemed pretty random, but you\u2019re Victor Nikiforov. You like to surprise people. I was extremely surprised, so, I mean, it seemed in character?\u201d</p>\n<p>Victor turned back around, pointing at him in accusation. \u201cWe all made fun of Yura\u2019s inability to dance off against you, and you thought\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re friends, and friends have inside jokes?\u201d</p>\n<p>Victor was looking more and more appalled. \u201cI took your hand, fed you dessert, told everyone we were planning on sleeping together, and you thought we had <em>never spoken before?</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUm. Yes?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou thought I was going to sleep with you while barely knowing who you were, and you were <em>okay</em> with that?\u201d</p>\n<p>Yuuri considered this. \u201cNo,\u201d he finally said. \u201cI wasn\u2019t just <em>okay</em> with that. I was over the moon about that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShit,\u201d Victor said, breaking into helpless laughter. \u201cI don\u2019t deserve you. I can\u2019t believe you don\u2019t remember. And to think that I never really lived until that moment when you whispered, \u2018Victor Nikiforov, I\u2019m going to do filthy things to you\u2019 in my ear.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh my God. I <em>said</em> that to you?\u201d Yuuri hid his face in his hands.</p>\n<p>Victor came over, knelt in front of him, and pulled his hands away. \u201cNo,\u201d he said, a delighted smile on his face. \u201cYou didn\u2019t say that. I was just teasing. But it\u2019s not too late to start.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yuuri looked into Victor\u2019s blue eyes. He felt his own heart hammering in his chest. He didn\u2019t know what he was doing, but\u2026 But, well. He was shy and anxious, but also\u2026maybe\u2026he was a little confident, too?</p>\n<p>He reached out and brushed Victor\u2019s hair away back. \u201cVictor Nikiforov,\u201d he said quietly, \u201cI\u2019m going to do filthy things to you. I don\u2019t know what they are or how to do them, but we aren\u2019t leaving this room until we figure them out.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s always porn,\u201d Victor said. \u201cThat should help.\u201d</p>\n<p>#</p>\n<p>Porn did not help. In fact, all the things that they both thought they should be able to do easily, according to porn, just did <em>not</em> work in reality.</p>\n<p>\u201cHow is this hard?\u201d Victor muttered. \u201cSlot A, Tab B, right?\u201d</p>\n<p>They ended up googling three times before things began to make sense, and if any of the skating gossip circle ever got wind of their google searches, the damage to both their reputations would be immense.</p>\n<p>They finally found an angle where Yuuri could slide in\u2014slowly\u2014waiting minute by minute for Victor\u2019s body to adjust, touching each other, feeling each other the entire way. It took some experimentation even then, once he was inside, the heat of Victor\u2019s body compressing him, to discover the precise rotation of hips that hit Victor\u2019s prostate.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh.\u201d Victor\u2019s eyes widened the first moment Yuuri found it. \u201cOh. There. That\u2019s why\u2026 Oh, god. Keep going.\u201d</p>\n<p>After that, they were off to the races, bodies coming together, lips coming together. Victor begging, <em>begging,</em> and Yuuri\u2019s anxiety evaporating at the sight of the other man beneath him, coming apart because of what <em>he</em> was doing to him. Victor came first\u2014Yuuri\u2019s cock, Yuuri\u2019s hands on him\u2014and the sounds he made when he did, soft and vulnerable, were enough to send Yuuri over the edge.</p>\n<p>It took them an hour in bed, holding each other, kissing, unwilling to let go, before they were ready to go again, switching positions this time. It was a little easier this time.</p>\n<p>\u201cHere,\u201d Victor said, \u201cit helped me when my legs were like this. There. No, I\u2019m not going to just push through it, are you nuts?\u201d</p>\n<p>It got better every time they woke from their exhausted stupor to try each other again. And again. And again.</p>\n<p>They missed the pairs figure skating final the next day, ordering giant bottles of water and pasta from room service to replenish their energy.</p>\n<p>It was around four in the afternoon\u2014an exhausted, delighted, four\u2014when Victor finally turned over and sighed. \u201cI\u2019m going to have to go back to my room to change for the banquet,\u201d he muttered into Yuuri\u2019s naked shoulder.</p>\n<p>\u201cMmm.\u201d Yuuri\u2019s arms closed around Victor. \u201cNo. Not allowed to leave. Not yet.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI suppose I could show up to the banquet like this. It would do wonders for both our reputations.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHaaaaa.\u201d Yuuri slowly sat up. \u201cI suppose.\u201d</p>\n<p>And then Victor asked the question, the one he hadn\u2019t wanted to let himself think about. \u201cWhen does your flight leave?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTomorrow.\u201d Yuuri\u2019s voice was low. \u201cTomorrow at ten.\u201d</p>\n<p>Victor didn\u2019t say anything for a while. They had a little more than twelve hours together, and a good portion of those hours would be spent at the banquet or sleeping\u2014and however little Yuuri <em>wanted</em> to sleep, they\u2019d gone one night without. Another would be impossible.</p>\n<p>A few hours together. He tried not to get depressed. Victor showered with him, soaping him off and then rinsing him clean, kissing each other under the hot spray as if they\u2019d never see each other again.</p>\n<p>And\u2026who even knew? Maybe they wouldn\u2019t.</p>\n<p>It would be eight months until the skating competition season started again. There was the ever-present possibility of injury, and who knew what else could happen in that time? Eight months, without excuses to see each other. Despite everything they\u2019d told each other, they hadn\u2019t talked about what this was.</p>\n<p>Victor waited until Yuuri was putting on his suit before he said anything.</p>\n<p>\u201cLook,\u201d Victor said, his voice low, \u201cthis may be a little forward of me\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBe forward,\u201d Yuuri urged. \u201cPlease be forward.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2026But I think we both know that you need a new coach.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yuuri blinked. This wasn\u2019t where he had thought the conversation would go.</p>\n<p>\u201cCelestino is holding you back,\u201d Victor said. \u201cAnd\u2026after I made everyone at the rink watch everything about you, I\u2019m sure Yakov would take you on. He thinks very highly of you, you know.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2026does?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019d have to train in St. Petersburg,\u201d Victor went on, \u201cand, um, I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve noticed, but we\u2019re actually good training partners? Our strengths are very complementary. And my rinkmates really like you, and\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd?\u201d Yuuri asked shyly.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd\u2026what are you doing?\u201d Victor stood, frowning at him. \u201cSeriously, what is wrong with you?\u201d</p>\n<p>Yuuri paused in the middle of tying his tie, his hopes freezing in his chest. \u201cUm. What <em>am</em> I doing?\u201d</p>\n<p>Victor took hold of his hand. \u201cComing with me to my room,\u201d he demanded. \u201cYou\u2019re not wearing that tie. The suit is bad enough, but there\u2019s nothing to be done about it at this point. That tie, though\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s my tie,\u201d Yuuri said, frowning. \u201cI bought it. I like it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMy <em>boyfriend,\u201d</em> Victor said passionately, \u201cis not going to his first banquet with me wearing a department-store tie.\u201d</p>\n<p>His <em>boyfriend.</em> Yuuri couldn\u2019t help but smile. \u201cYour <em>boyfriend,\u201d</em> he said with a smile, \u201cdoesn\u2019t know a thing about fashion, and he isn\u2019t going to start caring just because you tell him to do so. If you don\u2019t like the tie, take it off when we get back to the room. You don\u2019t touch it before then.\u201d</p>\n<p>Victor stared at him. He licked his lips. \u201cDamn,\u201d he said slowly. \u201cI never thought a lack of fashion sense could be hot.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBesides,\u201d Yuuri said calmly, \u201cI won gold this time around. You can take my tie when you come in first. We\u2019ll have plenty of chances to compete, now that I\u2019m moving to St. Petersburg.\u201d</p>\n<p>A predatory gleam shone in Victor\u2019s eye. \u201cIs that so?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, Nikiforov. It is.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re on, Katsuki.\u201d</p>\n<p>#</p>\n<p>An hour later, they were both clean and polished, all signs of their sex marathon erased so that they could present a somewhat innocent appearance at the banquet.</p>\n<p><em>Somewhat</em> being the key word.</p>\n<p>They even made a point of not arriving together. Yuuri waited in Victor\u2019s room for a few minutes after Victor went down, counting in his head.</p>\n<p>Still, the moment he walked into the banquet hall, his eyes met Victor\u2019s, and\u2026 And that smile. The way they moved toward each other as if nobody else were around. Why were they even bothering to pretend?</p>\n<p>\u201cHoly fucking crap,\u201d said Yurio, at Yuuri\u2019s elbow. \u201cStop it, you two. There are <em>children</em> present.\u201d</p>"
