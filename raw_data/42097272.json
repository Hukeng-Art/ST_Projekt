  "summary": "<p>Batman is insulted during a Justice League mission, which wouldn't be a problem except Nightwing is there to hear it. The other League members don't know this is a problem because they have no idea Batman has kids, much less that Nightwing is one of them. Bruce decides to do the only reasonable thing: go on vacation. His children probably won't burn down anything too important.</p>\n<p>Dick just wants to defend his family and brag about his siblings. Good thing his father taught him a few things about the importance of detailed plans and talented allies.</p>\n<p>The prank war starts with petty theft, purple, and cows.</p>\n<p>Possible ghost kitties, a cow, a cactus, and several Bats invade the Tower. There are a few realizations had but the Bats still aren't found.</p>\n<p>Bruce returns to the Watchtower is not surprised by what he finds. The Justice League has questions and actually gets some answers. The Batfamily definitely wins the war though.</p>",
  "notes": "<p>Hello everyone! I started this story at a random point in my time travel work when I needed a bit of lightheartedness. This story has a couple family feels moments (I can't help myself)) but mainly focuses on BAMF Batfamily pranking the League. I've always loved the identity/children reveal stories and so here I go!</p>\n<p>We have art now! Please take a look at the adorable <a href=\"https://www.tumblr.com/doodlebriggs/707743788791103488/aquaman-crying-over-stephs-purple-cactus-from\" rel=\"nofollow\">art </a>created by BDBriggs.</p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy the start of the prank war and the League not yet knowing what's hitting them. There's a bit of batsibling bonding, because I cannot help myself.</p>\n<p>One more to go! A few people are cluing in but the big reveal won't be until next chapter. Please enjoy a caring Hood and a giant cactus.</p>\n<p>I hope you enjoyed and got some laughs out of this story! It was a little different for me but I really enjoyed writing it!</p>",
  "text": "<p class=\"p1\">Bruce was tired.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">He was tired, sore, and actually rather itchy despite the blissfully warm containment shower he had taken upon their return to the Watchtower. The mission hadn\u2019t been difficult, exactly, but his regular human skin had not fared quite as well against the magical sparking vat of orange liquid as that of his alien and god teammates. The Batsuit could only do much.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Nightwing, thankfully, had been in a different part of the building and hadn\u2019t been exposed to the liquid at all. His suit had significantly less protection than the Batsuit to allow for his acrobatics and Bruce worried.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">His son also had more common sense than most of the other heroes at this table, at least from what they\u2019d shown on this recent mission to stop a mad scientist holed up with significant ray gun technology and an entire brainwashed town. The League had rescued the town and the scientist was currently in the hands of the proper authorities, so the mission was hardly a disaster.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">It was also hardly a success.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Unfortunately, the whole team knew this and were attempting to debrief. Bruce had tried to share what he considered the top three issues and had been simply talked over, which wasn\u2019t a usual problem. Batman was generally listened to when he spoke. Part of that reason, however, was the fact that Batman choose his moment to speak carefully and Bruce could recognize that this wasn\u2019t a good moment. Everyone was too overly energetic and there wasn\u2019t an incoming threat or mission to use as a focus.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Besides, it would hardly do his reputation good to be talked over <em>again.</em></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Nightwing was providing a more enjoyable alternative than attempting to corral the masses with his scathing commentary over various hand signals and slight facial expressions. Bruce would be insulted by some of Dick\u2019s comparisons of the Justice League to the Titans (and on at least two occasions Damian\u2019s dog, Titus), except at this moment Bruce rather agreed with him.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">He wondered how much longer until Dick faked a Titans\u2019s emergency and ducked out of the meeting, since the ability to prioritize his own team had been one of the agreements struck when Flash had recruited Nightwing. The Justice League had been more than willing to accept a few conditions for a hero of Nightwing\u2019s reputation, not to mention the several Titans that even Hal could tell only joined to support their leader.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Bruce had been so proud the day Nightwing had been sworn in, Cyborg and Raven flanking him for the entire ceremony. It was perhaps a bit bittersweet, since Bruce knew the moment signalled the end of almost all his arguments for keeping his kids a secret. Oh, the Justice League knew there were additional vigilantes in Gotham but the secretive nature of the Bats and Gotham itself had allowed Bruce to keep information to a minimum with a few judiciously applied glares.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Bruce understood Gotham and, while he knew and completely believed in the importance of the Justice League, it was easier to keep his children safe in Gotham. To believe they were safer outside of their city when they couldn\u2019t be linked back to Batman and used against each other. When not even the heroes knew that any of his children had an entire support network that was completely unseen and only a call away.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">But he trusted the Justice League now, today\u2019s mess notwithstanding, and his children knew it. Knew that Bruce would never have let Dick join (have backed his joining in full view and support of Flash\u2019s nomination) if the League wasn\u2019t trustworthy. His children were humouring Bruce, now, and only because they could see that Bruce himself knew the time was approaching to reveal their secret identities to their friends.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Besides, the no civilian names thing had been leveraged with impressive cohesion and teamwork to get Bruce to relax almost every other rule that wasn\u2019t directly related to safety. Tim and Damian, of all partnerships, had been directing their siblings in what to ask and when, casually pulling the \u2018since we can\u2019t reveal our names, can we at least\u2026\u2019 card with brutal efficiency.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">There had been two parties in the Batcave, holiday costumes for the last year, and nine separate team-ups with some of the greyer villains. Not to mention the Gopher Incident and the mini-golf debacle. Dick had stood on the manor grounds after that one, lazily twirling a putter he\u2019d picked up after walking into the mess side by side with Bruce (after saving him from a four hour Board Meeting) and said that Bruce now folded as reliably as a bat sought the dark.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Alfred had actually agreed. Aloud.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Bruce sighed. He\u2019d fold soon enough on the names, too. His kids were good and strong and together. They could handle themselves and he\u2019d just have to handle the worry.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Though not just yet. This nonsense could fuel his arguments for anonymity for at least another two to three weeks. None of his children had the patience for this kind of mess, except maybe Jason who\u2019d like to incite the chaos to greater heights. Or Steph who\u2019d throw food at the heroes while heckling them the entire time. Or Tim who\u2019d record everything for blackmail.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Maybe he\u2019d better not mention it after all.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Bruce refocused briefly when he heard his name again, someone trying to point out flaws in his performance that didn\u2019t exist. He knew he had flaws, he knew he made mistakes (his children loved to point them out, at length and at volume), but <em>Bruce </em>had followed the plan.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Hal was the one who uttered the death blow, which certainly wasn\u2019t a surprise. Nor was the way he blithely continued on as if he hadn\u2019t doomed them all.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cLook, I just don\u2019t see why we need to take advice on teamwork from a man who dresses up as a Bat and \u2018Works Alone.\u2019 Not that anyone besides us would put up with you, so I can\u2019t imagine you\u2019d get much practice.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Bruce blinked, slowly, and used his considerable training to refrain from pinching the bridge of his nose. He ignored both Diana and Clark arguing against Hal, which was rather sweet of them, to stare at his oldest son.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Dick had gone still in a way that very few ever pegged as dangerous. Bruce, however, had been convinced by a tiny child on completely calm feet that having a colourful acrobat tailing his shadow across dreary, crime-filled rooftops was a good idea. Bruce understood that a still Nightwing meant he was utterly focused and it was time resort to evasive manoeuvres.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The rest of Bruce\u2019s children had taken longer to make that connection, what with Dick intentionally hiding behind a smile and a laugh and his role of big brother. Sometimes Bruce<em> hated</em> how much he\u2019d let fall onto Dick shoulders, but then Dick would show up with pizza and movies and always always end those evenings with a hug and a whispered <em>thank you </em>in Bruce\u2019s ear.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">They\u2019d caught on though. Barbara first (she\u2019d always been Dick\u2019s confidant) and then Cass and Jason and all the others. These days a quiet Nightwing spread ripples of concern through the entire Gotham rotation as they tensed with uneasiness and prepared for complete mobilization because their Big Bird was going nowhere alone.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The Justice League could perhaps be excused for not recognizing the danger in the iron-straight spine of their newest recruit. They hadn\u2019t had near enough exposure to the cheery hero to see beyond the smiles. Though Barry was eyeing the man he\u2019d sponsored with a caution that Bruce was honestly surprised and bit impressed to see.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Dick began typing into the tablet he\u2019d had in front of him, ostensibly for playback and mission reports. Bruce glanced at his own screen, which stayed blank for for longer than he thought it should have before the message appeared.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Nightwing: <em>Nothing Agent A won\u2019t approve, promise.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></em></p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Bruce leaned back, getting the attention of a concerned looking Clark which Bruce summarily ignored.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Bruce thought about his butler. He thought about how Alfred\u2019s eyes always darkened when any of his family was insulted. He thought about how the man had been sending Bruce disappointed looks for months now as he put off introducing the League to his children.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">He thought about his children. He thought about how his children had come together and settled over this last year under his guidance and Dick\u2019s care and their own choices to become a more solid family than he could have ever dreamed. A family that could and would protect each other.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">He thought about the Justice League and how Bruce\u2019s children didn\u2019t always listen to him but would have known better to poke a fucking button next to a vat of unidentified liquid in the middle of a villain\u2019s lair.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Bruce stood, cape flaring out and gaining the attention of everyone in the room almost instantly.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cI\u2019m going on vacation,\u201d Bruce said. He didn\u2019t think he\u2019d ever seen his teammates look so flabbergasted or Dick so proud. \u201cMaybe I\u2019ll learn something about teamwork while away.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">He certainly would, since he planned on burying himself in his competent children. Though maybe he\u2019d take a bit of time off with Selina somewhere warm and see if he could sneak back as many jewels as she stole.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cDon\u2019t call me for two weeks,\u201d Bruce continued as if one of the silent Justice League members had said anything at all. Dick\u2019s nose wrinkled and Bruce sighed. \u201cMake that four. Try not to burn anything to the ground while I\u2019m gone.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Hal started sputtering indignantly, but Bruce hadn\u2019t been talking to him.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Dick only smirked, which wasn\u2019t an agreement. Bruce paused a moment, but decided it wan\u2019t his problem and left with what might have passed as a wink to Diana and Clark. They had tried to defend him after all, so maybe deserved a little bit of warning.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<b>We are the Night</b>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Dick: <em>We\u2019re going to war with the Justice League.</em></p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Jason: <em>Fuck yes.</em></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Jason: <em>I\u2019ll bring the explosives.</em></p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Tim: <em>Which contingency?<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></em></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Tim: <em>I\u2019m prepared for Plans B, K, and L through AX.</em></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Tim: <em>Though need appropriate time to unlock the relevant bunkers for the 63-2 series.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></em></p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Cass: <em>I like Plan Q.</em></p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Tim: <em>Plan Q is easier now that Ivy\u2019s with the Sirens.</em></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Tim: <em>She\u2019d totally get us enough plants if Selina asks.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></em></p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Damian: <em>I could also get us the required botany.</em></p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Tim: <em>Right.</em></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Tim: <em>I forgot the Sirens think your savageness is adorable.</em></p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Damian: <em>They have good taste, unlike some I could mention.</em></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Damian: <em>Though I would prefer to use my katana.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></em></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Damian: <em>It is a more appropriate response for the Caped Cretins finally having proven themselves insufficient to be Father\u2019s allies.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></em></p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Duke: <em>Okay, so that\u2019s a decent point.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></em></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Duke: <em>If.</em></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Duke: <em>As the only one with common sense</em></p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Jason: <em>Rude.</em></p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Cass: <em>Honest.</em></p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Steph: <em>Accurate.</em></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Steph: <em>And Plan AG is my favourite.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></em></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Steph: <em>Glitter, bombs, and glow-in the dark paint.</em></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Steph:<em> What else needs to be said?</em></p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Duke:<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span><em> I feel the need to ask what actually happened.</em></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Duke: <em>I mean, I\u2019m down for both pranking the shit out of the League or destroying them utterly.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></em></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Duke: <em>Because you\u2019re a cult and I\u2019ve been corrupted.</em></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Duke: <em>But I still like to know why occasionally.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></em></p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Jason: <em>Big Bird?</em></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Jason: <em>You\u2019re damn quiet.</em></p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Steph: <em>Unusually so.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></em></p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Dick: <em>\u2026</em></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Dick: <em>I am upset.</em></p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Damian: <em>Richard?</em></p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Dick: <em>Firstly;

Partly because escalation was a sound battle strategy but mostly because they were petty little shits. Petty little shits with four whole weeks.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">They started by stealing all the spoons. Well, Cass stole all the spoons, because she was a damn ghost and the least likely to be distracted with the entire Batfamily arguing on the comms about the definition of \u2018spoon.\u2019 She was clearly still listening, however, since she also grabbed soup ladles, measuring cups (both science and kitchen), wooden stirring spoons, two gardening spades, and two large cleaning buckets to carrying everything.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">She was frowning when she came back, that particular expression that Dick knew was part genuine disappointment and part pout.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cToo easy,\u201d Cass said as she placed the buckets on the table with an audible thump that really expressed her irritation.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cI completely agree.\u201d Babs frowned from the Batcomputer that she and Tim had taken shared custody over as soon as Bruce had left the manor. The man had tried to use his Justice League vacation to catch up on Gotham work for all of an hour before he caved to Alfred\u2019s frosty glare and the combined eyes of Tim and Damian.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Dick had maybe deserved the glare Bruce had sent his way as a laughing Selena tugged him to the car, but only maybe. His brothers had really added their own flare to the Baby Bird Eyes of Dick\u2019s youth, so he would argue that he was no longer responsible. But Bruce was gone so couldn\u2019t actually assign blame anyways.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Babs pulled up a still frame from the surveillance footage of Black Bat casually sitting on top of cabinet, one leg dangling, as Green Lantern and Hawkgirl walked down the hallway.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Dick scratched the back of his head. \u201cThey\u2019re in a safe place. They know they\u2019re secure so are relaxing their guard.\u201d<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">At the incredulous looks his family was sending, Dick held up both palms. \u201cHey, none of that now. Didn\u2019t say it was excusable. My Titans would be running drills for weeks, remember? Just want to put out a little context and keep in mind the fact that these people are highly trained. And that we\u2019re literally poking them into paranoia with a sharp, bat-shaped stick so we can\u2019t expect this behaviour the whole way through.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cFair enough,\u201d Tim scowled as he typed. \u201cBut it\u2019s still going in the report.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cCourse, Baby Bird.\u201d Dick leaned on the back of Tim\u2019s chair. \u201cHow\u2019s the cybersecurity?\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Tim and Babs scoffed as one, Damian looking over from where he and Duke were paying way too close attention to something Jay was doing with wires. Damian looked just slightly confused at how similar their sound was to his trademark noise. No one else noticed the reaction, however, so Dick vowed to keep it to himself. For now.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cAbysmal.\u201d Babs huffed again, crossing her arms to glare at the screen that held security from all across the Watchtower. \u201cI mean, I helped Bruce set a lot of this up, so it\u2019s not like it was going to be particularly challenging for me to get into, but I haven\u2019t been involved in maintaining the systems and it shows.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cPart of Bruce\u2019s over-protective paranoia,\u201d Tim explained rather unnecessarily, but slightly petulantly. Dick knew the boy had permanent routes into the Justice League databases but had mostly, reluctantly, also left the security alone.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Babs started typing again. \u201cI know Cyborg at least is better than this.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cCyborg isn\u2019t allowed that deep into the systems yet. Technically all us newbies are still on probation.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Babs looked over her glasses at him. \u201cThat\u2019s both fair and an extreme waste of resources.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cWe are ready for Stage Two,\u201d Damian announced before Dick could respond.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cNo,\u201d Dick told Damian, Duke, and Jason, none of them even attempting to hide the small detonation device they\u2019d been working on. \u201cThat\u2019s like, Stage Six. At the earliest. And I know you all know that; you were part of the planning and the briefing.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cTt.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cFine, Dickiebird. Ruin our fun. Come on, Demon Brat, just means more time for building.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Duke didn\u2019t follow Jason as the man walked away. Instead he tilted his head. \u201cSo when exactly is Stage Two starting?\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">There was a cackle and all heads turned back to the screens, Cass offering Dick a handful of popcorn from the bowl she\u2019d somehow produced.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cDo I want to know why you had that much purple spray paint on hand?\u201d Tim asked, sighing at the screen Duke was now staring at with hands on his hips.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cProbably not, Baby Bird,\u201d Dick lied as he settled on the arm of his brother\u2019s chair to watch Spoiler creep through the vents he\u2019d extensively mapped within a week of gaining probationary access to the Watchtower. \u201cProbably not.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Spoiler spray painted all the weapons in the Tower purple for Stage Two. She started in the armoury only to use the fuss of everyone being drawn to the armoury by the newly purple weapons to hit what was left in the training rooms. She didn\u2019t get everything, leaving weapons that would be damaged permanently by the paint or might react badly to the chemicals (there were some odd alien or magic things in the Tower), but otherwise was very thorough.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">And Dick and Steph had been very thorough with the paint itself. It was Batpaint. It was not coming out without a particular mixture that the Flash could maybe synthesize, except for the part where he was an ally and wouldn\u2019t dare.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Steph also hit the things that were only weapons to a Bat. She found a couple of umbrellas. Replaced the kitchen pans with specialty purple ones that wouldn\u2019t contaminate food. Painted a couple of small, decorative statues. Managed to paint the entirety of a bookcase (while leaving all objects on said bookcase untouched) in honour of the shelving unit Damian had managed to topple onto drug kingpin last month.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">She also placed her purple cactus Stevie on the kitchen counter under Aquaman\u2019s snacks. Dick had given her that cactus for Christmas, and was very happy to see it weaponized for a good cause. Tim had thought the force-field enabled pot a bit overkill, but Dick had known it would come in handy.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Really, Steph had been <em>Dick\u2019s </em>Batgirl, in the awful time when he\u2019d worn the Batman cowl. The Batfamily had no excuse not to realize just how frequently he and Steph were in perfectly coordinated cahoots. The only one who had picked up on their particular, patient brand of chaos was Damian (<em>their </em>Robin), and he was In On It half the time.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The fact that the paint was not being used for the original intended purpose was a little disappointing, but he and Steph agreed that needs must. Besides, another month of false-security where Bruce\u2019s beloved Batmobile remained untouched would only be to their benefit.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Timing had to perfect for revenge, after all.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<b>Heroes of the Tower</b>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Green Lantern: <em>So I know we were worried about the weapons all being purple.</em></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Green Lantern: <em>But so are all the pencils.</em></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Green Lantern: <em>And the stuffed moose that Wonder Woman brought back from that carnival mission.</em></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Green Lantern: <em>I think we\u2019re fine and the fucking prankster just went wild with purple paint and started with the weapons.</em></p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Nightwing: <em>I once captured a villain with a pack of pencils.</em></p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Green Lantern: <em>Kid?</em></p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Cyborg: <em>I remember that.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></em></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Cyborg: <em>Why Beast Boy and Red Arrow keep betting against you I\u2019ll never know.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></em></p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Nightwing: <em>Pencils are very dangerous things if sharpened correctly!</em></p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Raven: <em>Didn\u2019t you also plant explosives in several stuffed animals?</em></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Raven: <em>For that distraction in New York?</em></p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Nightwing: <em>It hurt my heart to do it.</em></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Nightwing: <em>But sometimes needs must.</em></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Nightwing: <em>I\u2019m sure Penguin agrees, what with all his weaponized umbrellas.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></em></p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Flash: <em>So all in favour of searching every single purple thing in case it\u2019s a weapon in disguise?</em></p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Green Lantern: <em>Fuck.</em></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Green Lantern: <em>I ain\u2019t going near that moose.</em></p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Hawkgirl: <em>I\u2019ll take the cookware.</em></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Hawkgirl: <em>I\u2019ve always wanted to whack someone up the head with a skillet.</em></p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Nightwing: <em>Oh!

Duke had suggested an early lull to further make things seem like just a couple of small pranks and allow for one on one targeting. He had been abashed when Cass had patted him on the head, but pleased with the general approval of the family. His psychological warfare training had clearly been progressing smoothly.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Cass took Green Lantern for her part in the one on one targeting, hiding any remote from his view but always returning it when someone else appeared and Hal asked. Wonder Woman\u2019s expression when she\u2019d pointed to the remote for the monitors sitting on the nearby table was a thing of beauty.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Duke himself was responsible for using his illusion powers to periodically move Steph\u2019s cactus in a strategic manner. He\u2019d chosen Aquaman as his target to Steph\u2019s approval.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Jason had methodically switched all the books on the Watchtower to poetry volumes and Shakespeare. Martian Manhunter was more bemused than anything, but seemed to actually enjoyed the volumes and go on a hunt for the others. Green Arrow was a different story, particularly when technology started beeping at him and the physical instruction manuals were no longer to be found.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Tim signed Hawkgirl up for a mailing list about cookware, and then proceeded to find other lists for other heroes that referenced conversations that he shouldn\u2019t have had access to in the first place.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Damian had created an intel report focused on the fictional Rancher King\u2019s plan to steal all the world\u2019s cows. It was a thing of beauty, full of details and just enough plausibility that Shazam couldn\u2019t quite dismiss it off hand and pulled in Flash and Black Canary.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Steph and Babs had loved this particular plan so much that Steph was on page twenty four of the Rancher King\u2019s manifesto and Damian and Dick were currently on the Batplane to check out a recently decommissioned farm warehouse (the Riddler had recently tried a plan involving the international stage, animal puns, and way too many eggs) in order to repurpose it as the Rancher King\u2019s lair.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">They wouldn\u2019t take the Justice League\u2019s attention from actual cases, naturally, but it had been a fairly calm week and the \u2018case\u2019 would build slowly. Hints would be dropped at appropriate (non-life-threatening) times to allude to the Rancher King\u2019s unfortunate past as a mistreated farm hand after his tragic accident in a lab that specialized in shrinking technology.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">They were running a little wild, but really, they\u2019d seen stranger things. Also, Dick was very glad that none of his family were really inclined to jump into the whole costumed villainy thing, Jay\u2019s anti-hero declarations aside. Steph\u2019s fake manifesto was very impassioned and Tim had a lot of ideas on how one might reasonably steal all the world\u2019s cows, starting in the US.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Dick would be concerned, but he was too busy being proud.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Damian came to sit on the arm of Dick\u2019s chair and Dick switched everything over to autopilot; they still had a good thirty minutes before they arrived. He waited patiently, absently pretending to check different instruments until Damian found whatever words he needed.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cIs it my fault?\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Dick didn\u2019t actually know what his baby brother was talking about so he bit back the desire to promise that \u2018it\u2019 wasn\u2019t. He loved Damian with all his heart but knew well the kid was a bit of a hellion who, through no fault of his own, sometimes needed the \u2018assassin ways of doing things are not the only or even the best ways of doing things\u2019 conversation.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cIs what your fault, Baby Bat?\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cFather\u2019s lockdown on identities. I am the youngest. It would be logical to assume that if I was not involved the order would have been removed long ago.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Dick leaned back, head thumping lightly into the chair. \u201cNo, Damian, it\u2019s not you fault.\u201d Before Damian could scoff, Dick nudged the boys shoulder and wrapped a hand around the kid\u2019s knee, making him just a bit more secure on his perch. \u201cDuke is newer than you, though not younger, and without your extensive training. The lockdown order was because we were young as a family, and so were the various Superhero teams. And because B is paranoid.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Dick raised a hand and traced it along Dami\u2019s cheekbone, a move that the kid wouldn\u2019t have accepted a year ago and probably still wouldn\u2019t accept from anyone else. \u201cWe weren\u2019t ready, Baby Bat. Not with everything that\u2019s happened in Gotham and the family in the last few years. But we are now. We know exactly how we\u2019ll react when one of us is in trouble and its by pulling <em>together.</em> We trust our allies and our training and each other and it\u2019s time now. Despite the way B\u2019s love is making him scared.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Damian leaned in, slight relief lacing his spine. Dick couldn\u2019t help but think this would be good for them all and not just because of the increased social connections and security to their friendships. They were all comfortable in the shadows, in secrecy, but there was something weighty in being acknowledged. It wasn\u2019t just his Baby Bat that could use another, more public claim that he belonged. That he was theirs.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Dick was going to tell <em>everyone </em>how proud of his family he was. He had a list. There were photos attached. It was maybe more of document or a report. In Power Point. With animations.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Regardless, he had so much bragging to do.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cAnd Father will agree?\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Dick didn\u2019t say that he was pretty sure Bruce already had. While he was irritatingly good at ignoring comments aimed his way because Batman didn\u2019t care and Brucie didn\u2019t notice, he was also irritatingly good at reading Dick. Bruce knew what giving Dick, much less the entire family, free reign actually meant.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">With a smile, Dick wrapped his arms around Damian\u2019s waist, ignoring the slight squawk and what were only token protests. \u201cCourse he will. That\u2019s Robin\u2019s job, isn\u2019t it? To pull Bruce into the light even when the shadows are his own fears?\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Damian looked at Dick for a long moment, face still and intent, before he scoffed. \u201cAnd to hurt those who hurt him.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Dick laughed.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">His brother wasn\u2019t wrong, after all.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<b>(Purple) Heroes of the Tower<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></b>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Black Canary: <em>Are we going to talk about the cows?</em></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Black Canary: <em>I feel like it\u2019s time to talk about the cows.</em></p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Flash: <em>Look, no one is stupid enough to try and kidnap the world\u2019s cows.</em></p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Shazam: <em>No!</em></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Shazam: <em>We don\u2019t challenge the bad guys to be dumb.</em></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Shazam: <em>That\u2019s stupid.

They knock into the wall, which explodes in glitter and triggers a pouring of thick, oily goop onto both their heads from the ceiling. There is a loud, high shriek and a roar of rage as the video pans around the full mess.

At least for the first few days. It was a very simple plan that basically boiled down to moving more shit around. They moved furniture slightly. Left cups and weapons and briefing notes in places that were not where their owners had left them.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Tim started the escalation by fucking with the temperature of the Watchtower and creating cold rooms that did not match the readings. After that, he played the recordings at random times from hidden speakers. Many were ambient Gotham noise from particularly high up gargoyles, since the wind really shrieked around those stone wings.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Jason had quite a bit of fun gaining the rest and he wasn\u2019t specifying where exactly the screams and moans came from. Dick would have been more concerned but he was the sole owner of the knowledge (excepting Bruce and Alfred who did not count) that Jason had been in the drama club during high school.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Besides, being dramatic asses together was a core foundation of his and Jason\u2019s relationship. They had also maybe spent too long getting the Robin Cackle to bounce back just right off rooftops but they weren\u2019t going to tell anyone.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Besides, the way Green Lantern flinched and Shazam twitched every time Timmy played the cackle recording was hilarious. Particularly when he timed it with the glitching of various electronic equipment.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">They let recordings take center stage for a good day or so before the writing appeared. The writing that was maybe more like random graffiti located all around the Watchtower in inconspicuous places like vents, baseboards, shelf edges, and the fridge. And the the walls, doors, and lighting fixtures. Also inside the cabinets and cereal boxes.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Shazam had been pulled off the cows to looks at the writing, since he might not have a lot of experience with ghosts, but did with \u2018magic mumbo jumbo,\u2019 in the words of Green Arrow. Unfortunately for Shazam (and Dick was planning on inviting the poor kid for dinner after this as he could probably use some of Alfred\u2019s lasagna), the writing wasn\u2019t magic at all.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">A week and a surprising assist from Superman later had Shazam bursting into the most recent meeting about the nature and threat assessment of moving purple<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 </span>folding chairs while waving a stack of papers.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cIt\u2019s another manifesto!\u201d Shazam shouted.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cFrom the ghosts?\u201d Asked Dick, smiling benevolently and getting suspicious looks from Green Lantern and Hawkgirl. They didn\u2019t really believe Dick had made friends with the ghosts, but were still suspicious. This was fair because Flash and Cyborg had started asking Dick how the ghosts were doing in a conversational manner only for less stuff to go wrong directly around them.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cFrom the <em>cactus.\u201d<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></em></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Aquaman twitched so hard that he tried to cover it up by slamming his palms on the table and standing abruptly. \u201cI knew its disappearance was trouble!\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Steph giggled madly in Dick\u2019s ear as the boys took potshots at the various heroes\u2019 inability to multitask. Dick was already waiting for Superman\u2019s look when the man heard the voices on Dick\u2019s comm, resting his chin on his hand as various shouts and complaints built around them, much like they had after that disastrous mission that had started it all.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cShh, Uncle Supes,\u201d Dick whispered into his hand, able to tell by the fairest frown between Superman\u2019s eyebrows that he was indeed able to hear the whisper over the growing cacophony. \u201cDon\u2019t want to spoil B\u2019s surprise, now do we?\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Superman blinked, mouthed the words \u2018uncle\u2019 and \u2018B\u2019 before his eyes rounded comically wide and he made an odd jerk of the head that Dick imagined would have led to whipping his head around had B been there or had Supes not already been looking at Dick.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Dick lowered his hand to smirk, low and self-satisfied in a way that he had absolutely stolen from his father when Batman had made a particularly clever deduction or solved a particularly difficult problem. Dick would have gone with the Batgrowl or Batglare, but the growl needed a certain level of volume to be effective and the glare would have been too effective at silencing the<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 </span>surrounding nonsense.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Superman blinked for another moment before beaming at Dick. Dick huffed a laugh; the man had no subtly at all. Thankfully, only Wonder Woman noticed Superman\u2019s odd behaviour, the rest bickering about priority rankings between cows, ghosts, the colour purple, and getting a full tech re-working of the Tower because cold spots, malfunctions, and random Disney songs could not be normal operating procedures and where was Bataman when you needed him? Did no one else have the missing instruction manual memorized?<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Dick didn\u2019t even have to try to add to the chaos.

Dick had almost cried when they\u2019d presented it. He didn\u2019t, because that would make one or both of them clam right up, start insulting the other, and bring out something sharp. But the temptation was there.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Damian proposed bringing several of the stray Gotham cats up to the Watchtower in order to cause confusion. Gotham cats were, naturally, as tough if not tougher than her people and Damian had been feeding them for months. He was the Pied Piper of cats to the point where Bruce had tested the boy for a Meta gene twice.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Tim proposed adding several robotic cats. Apparently, Tim had been working on a spy-cat for Damian\u2019s birthday that was ready for some practical testing. This would have the dual benefit of gaining more information and messing with anyone who could communicate with animals.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Tim went to add that he could modify the cactus-pot-forcefield into collars for the living cats, so they could be extra safe. The Justice League were heroes and generally quite fond of animals, but one never could be too safe when dealing with unpredictable powers. The surprised look that Damian sent Tim was edged with just a bit of awe, which Tim caught, if the embarrassed blush was anything to go by.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">They ironed out some of the details as a group before patrol, with Damian and Tim going out together to select which of Damian\u2019s cats (because Bruce was coming back to a bunch of adopted strays that he wouldn\u2019t be able to deny after they\u2019d defended Bruce\u2019s honour so valiantly) as the ones that would be suited for or enjoy a new environment.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Jason had volunteered to partner with Dick, which wasn\u2019t unusual, exactly, but not particularly common either. Jay would accept Dick latching on to him for patrols with minimal grumbling, and the occasional pleased slant to his sneer, but wasn\u2019t generally keen on volunteering for anything that wasn\u2019t immediate violence.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">So Dick was not surprised when, halfway into the surprisingly quiet patrol (or maybe not that surprisingly, since the entire Batfamily was in the city and that was the kind of thing Gothamites noticed), Jason removed his helmet and turned to Dick on an empty rooftop.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cSo what\u2019s eating you, Goldie?\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Dick sighed, but Jay\u2019s mask didn\u2019t do anything to hide the determined slant to his jaw. Dick\u2019s baby brother was bracing for Emotions.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Dick leaned back against the nearby gargoyle, stone claws digging faintly into his back as he crossed his arms.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cWell, you ain\u2019t denying there\u2019s something, so I guess that\u2019s a start.\u201d Jason came to loom right in front of Dick and Dick almost wanted to tear up again. Jason hated emotional talks, yet here he was, <em>worried </em>for <em>Dick.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></em></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cYeah, that\u2019s what I mean. What\u2019s up with the tears, Dickhead?\u201d Jay\u2019s hand tapped at Dick\u2019s jaw, having read the tenseness there just as easily as Dick had Jay\u2019s.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Dick sighed again, but stepped forward. He didn\u2019t go for a full hug, because Jay really had to be in the right mood for those particularly when in the open, but leaned his head on his brother\u2019s armoured chest. Dick melted just a bit closer when a large, gloved hand settled on the back of his neck.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cJust tired, Hood.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Jason paused, mind clearly turning. \u201cOkay. Tired from what? Or of what?\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cI already told you about the League.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cYeah, which is why I know that\u2019s not it. We have a plan for that shit. Sides, Batman can take care of himself-\u201c</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cIt\u2019s not just about Batman!\u201d Dick winced as he felt his brother flinch at Dick\u2019s volume. When Jay didn\u2019t move away, Dick pressed his forehead just a bit harder into his baby brother\u2019s armour and raised his hands so they were anchored in Jay\u2019s leather jacket.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cIt\u2019s not just about B,\u201d Dick repeated, softer. \u201cNot really. It\u2019s just. He shouldn\u2019t have to. We can all look after ourselves, Hood. B would never have let us run wild if we couldn\u2019t. But we <em>don\u2019t have to.</em>\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Dick took a half step back and raised his head to look Jason in the face.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cI sat in the fucking Tower when Red Arrow hopped on his bike and rode to answer your distress call last month. Spoiler and Red Robin brought down that Pumpkin Monster on National television and I couldn\u2019t tell the hero right next to me that those were my baby siblings. That idiot vigilante from Maine told Robin to stop throwing a tantrum for his legitimate concerns about an alien bear\u2019s safety and I couldn\u2019t give her the verbal beatdown of her life.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Dick\u2019s gloved fingers flexed in Jay\u2019s jacket and the younger man reached up to cover them.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cI get B\u2019s secrecy policy. I even agreed with it, mostly, when I wasn\u2019t being an idiot teenager. But, it\u2019s been a hard few years.\u201d Dick lowered his head again, right over his baby brother\u2019s (beating, not stopped) heart. \u201cA really hard few years. We\u2019ve come so far, Little Wing. So far. Robin and RR are plotting together. Signal\u2019s admitting he\u2019s ours unprompted. BB and Spoiler haven\u2019t missed a family dinner in months. You\u2019re willingly patrolling with me because you\u2019re worried. I\u2019m just so so proud of us. And, I don\u2019t- I want people to <em>know.\u201d</em></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Jason shifted slightly as Dick breathed, his hands pressing into Dick as if bracing him.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cWhen the Joker kidnapped Robin,\u201d Jason started slowly, tensing along with Dick though neither moved away, \u201cwe were patrolling together. I remember hearing Bruce\u2019s voice on the comms, but not his words. There was a lot of green in my vision, but I still saw you, your expression. I remember thinking, \u2018Oh, so we\u2019re going to war.\u2019 There was no hesitation, no doubt that you wouldn\u2019t be exactly at my side. That the other\u2019s wouldn\u2019t be at our backs.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cOurs,\u201d said Cass, leaping lightly down from the gargoyle with a scuff of sound that was nothing less than courtesy. She wrapped herself around Dick\u2019s back and he adjusted with practiced ease as she leaned forward and hooked her arm around Jay\u2019s neck. \u201cOur baby siblings. Protect.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Dick laughed, probably a bit wetly.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cYeah,\u201d Jason agreed, definitely a bit gruffly. \u201cAnd sure, B\u2019s plan for the secret army to protect the kids with the element of surprise was fine, but I\u2019m for something a bit more direct. We\u2019ll let the world know what Gotham already does.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cHurt a Bat, get all Bats,\u201d Cass agreed.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Dick released Jay\u2019s jacket with on hand to grip his sister\u2019s arm.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">He wondered what exactly Jay had seen in his expression that night Dami had been taken, either at the moment or later, when the Joker had ended up broken at Nightwing\u2019s feet. Dick knew that all the kids had looked at him differently after that night. Not in a bad way, but in a more knowing way.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Dick had watched his parents die. Dick had lost his baby brother before he\u2019d known how to handle a baby brother and getting Jay back hadn\u2019t really changed the fact that he\u2019d been <em>gone</em>. Dick had watched is family grow and take the skies and try to do nothing more or less than <em>help. </em>Dick had taken a long look at all the strays his father had started trying to care for, to save, and said okay. Had said alright. Had said <em>mine.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></em></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The Batkids knew what that meant, now. Bruce had always known, even if he\u2019d briefly forgotten, because Bruce had let a child call himself Batman\u2019s partner and understood that for all the ways it wasn\u2019t true, there was more that one way it <em>was</em>.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cBig Bird not alone, either.\u201d Cass buried her face in Dick\u2019s hair.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cFuck no,\u201d Jay said. \u201cI ain\u2019t letting you fuck shit up on your own. Time to punch all those shitheads in the face.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Dick laughed again. This time the sound was warm and soft and bladed around the edges.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<b>(Purple) Heroes of the (Haunted) Tower<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></b>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Green Arrow: <em>Is this a ghost cat?</em></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Green Arrow sent a photo: <em>[A pale grey cat with one missing eye and claw marks raked down it\u2019s back sits in the middle of an empty hall staring at the camera with reflective eyes.]</em></p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Wonder Woman: <em>I do not believe so.</em></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Wonder Woman: <em>This one, however, is not alive.</em></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Wonder Woman sent a photo: <em>[Glowing red eyes and a faint feline face are just visible through the grate of a vent.]</em></p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Aquaman: <em>There are two in the kitchen.</em></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Aquaman: <em>One is purring so probably not dead.</em></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Aquaman: <em>Though it\u2019s sitting in the initial cactus zone so is suspicious.</em></p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Hawkgirl: <em>Will you leave the cactus thing alone?</em></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Hawkgirl: <em>It was a plant and therefore not stalking you.</em></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Hawkgirl: <em>If it ever even existed.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></em></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Hawkgirl: <em>The cactus manifesto was clearly just another prank.</em></p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Aquaman: <em>You will regret doubting the danger of the cactus.</em></p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Shazam: <em>The possible ghost kitties like the cow!</em></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Shazam sent a photo: <em>[A large brown cow is standing on polished floors while chewing something from the large pot in front of it.

J\u2019onn had finished reading Eustace two volumes of poetry and Dick and J\u2019onn had made it through three games of Go Fish when the Flash came to find them.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cSuperman said you two are on plant-watch.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cYup,\u201d Dick popped the sound. \u201cPretty easy gig, to be honest. Bit of a safe zone, if Eustace likes you.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cReally?\u201d Asked Barry, eyeing the giant cactus that rustled threatening over his head. He didn\u2019t bat an eye at the name.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cQuite,\u201d J\u2019onn replied. \u201cShe likes poetry.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cCool. Cool cool.\u201d He zipped away only to return with four of Jay\u2019s poetry substitutions, a pizza, and three kinds of chips. \u201cHope you don\u2019t mind, but I could use a bit of time in a safe zone. Aquaman\u2019s crying in a closet, Green Lantern is being defeated by the possible ghost kitties, Green Arrow is being defeated by the computer, and Superman and Wonder Woman have taken over for Shazam and Black Canary after the fourteenth shell company for the Rancher King made Black Canary chuck a laptop at the wall.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cYou are welcome to join us.\u201d J\u2019onn gestured to the ground beside his camp chair, missing the slightly dirty look Flash sent Nightwing at the mention of the Rancher King. Dick ignored him, but the point was fair. Tim and Babs had maybe gone a bit overboard in protecting the identity of their fictitious villain.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Oh well, Cass and Duke had a fantastic time selecting all the stuffed cows, puzzles, and plastic animals, not to mention all the charitable organizations that were about to get very large donations of farm-related toys. <span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cDon\u2019t mind if I do,\u201d Barry sighed.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span>They made it to round eight before Dick decided to ask the question. Round eight had progressed to giving the draw pile to Eustace and letting her wave the cards about on long needles. J\u2019onn was using telekinesis to retrieve the cards, Barry his speed, and Dick both the fact that he was Eustace\u2019s favourite and that he had cards stashed in his boot.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span>\u201cSo,\u201d Dick drawled as he and his companions ignored a distant explosion. \u201cWhen do we call for backup?\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Flash paused after receiving the Jack of Diamonds from a slightly pouty J\u2019onn. \u201cWhy does no one realize all our children follow you?\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cMy sister says it\u2019s because my smile is full of secrets. My brother says it\u2019s because I\u2019m a demon in disguise. Which rude, I\u2019m much worse than those bozos we took out last week.

He hadn\u2019t expected to find his children in an all-out stand-off with the Justice League and was actually rather disappointed in himself. Now that Bruce was presented with the line of Gotham vigilantes facing a battered Justice League, supplemented with the occasional Titan and reserve member, this outcome seemed rather obvious.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Bruce eyed the pockmarked walls behind the standoff warily. There had clearly been several minor explosions and not all of the glitter and goop variety.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cBatman!\u201d Wonder Woman called out, obviously pleased with the battle so far and face to face with Robin, both with swords drawn. \u201cI hope you enjoyed your vacation.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cIt was adequate.\u201d They only mistake he\u2019d made was listening to Alfred when the man encouraged him to head right up to the Watchtower. The man never wanted him to head right up to the Watchtower. \u201cDare I ask?\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cWe\u2019re being invaded!\u201d Hal had obviously taken more hits than the others and was still partially doused in yellow paint. He almost had Bruce\u2019s sympathy; personal experience told Bruce that the paint did not come out in the wash.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Nightwing, however, chirped, \u201cTeamwork exercises!\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">All the heroes turned to look at him, dawning realization in several stances, particularly the Titans. Wonder Girl, Kid Flash, Aqualad, and Red Arrow all audibly groaned.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Martian Manhunter nodded. \u201cI see.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cI don\u2019t. What the hell?\u201d Asked Green Arrow.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cI\u2019ll explain it to you later,\u201d Red Arrow told him from his place beside Black Canary. \u201cJust arm up.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">To his credit, Green Arrow did raise his bow again.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Hood grinned from the Bat side. \u201cTime to choose a side, Old Man.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Bruce didn\u2019t look to see the reactions to that particular comment, though he did hear at least three gasps at the name. Instead, he threw a handful of smoke bombs and lunged at Aquaman.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Bruce never had to choose when it came to his children.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Aquaman flinched hard enough that Batman knew his children hadn\u2019t been holding back while he was gone. It took a swift kick and a Batarang and the man\u2019s trident went flying, Spoiler catching it with a cackle as she raced by. Aquaman whirled at the sound, as he was meant to, and Batman swept his feet from under him and had the man tied up in a matter of moments.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Batman turned, ducking as he went to avoid an arrow and almost smiled as Robin threw Green Lantern\u2019s ring into the middle of empty space. Green Lantern crowed, thinking he\u2019d finally get the ring back, but Signal appeared in true Bat fashion to snatch it from Green Lantern\u2019s grasp.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Red Robin and Black Bat were dealing with both the Flashes, keeping them occupied as Hood lay down cover fire while also duelling projectiles with both Arrows. Batman felt this was a lot for Hood to be dealing with, so threw a series of Batarangs at Green Arrow, who split his attention from Hood to face Batman. This was a mistake, since he completely missed Spoiler creeping up behind him in order to whack him in the arm with a large purple frying pan.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Green Arrow went down to one knee at the force of the blow and Batman slid forward into the space to bind him. Green Arrow glared at Batman, frown only growing as Spoiler yanked his quiver off his back and danced away after a quick sideways hug for Batman.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cWhat the fuck are you doing?\u201d Green Arrow asked.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cWinning,\u201d Batman replied.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">He watched Spoiler kick Black Canary in the stomach, Red Robin attacking from behind after switching spots with Signal. Signal and Hood were wrapping up the fight with the Flashes, using Signal\u2019s powers to manoeuvre both speedsters into the optimal position for Hood\u2019s tranquilizers. Kid Flash was already down, cuffed, and hurling playful insults at Nightwing.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Nightwing and Robin were dancing.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The two of them were taking on Hawkgirl and flipping around each other so much that Hawkgirl was getting dizzy, swearing up a storm and demanding they stay fucking still. Batman could have told her that Nightwing didn\u2019t do still.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Wonder Girl came to Hawkgirl\u2019s rescue and Nightwing ducked down so Robin could spring off his back, gaining height for a spectacular barrage of Birdarangs. Robin landed amidst a pink smoke bomb thrown by Nightwing and disarmed Hawkgirl of her mace which was sent flying into Spoiler\u2019s waiting clutches. Nightwing took the moment to signal for Black Bat to take over for him, since he was intentionally avoiding fighting any of the Titans as they were already highly familiar with is abilities.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">This probably also explained why Raven was already off to the side, bearing a cheap name-tag style sticker that read \u2018Out\u2019 in blue marker on her cloak. She looked quiet content to sit and watch. Cyborg was ignoring everything to type madly at a computer. Batman knew the stance of a techie losing a battle with Oracle well.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Batman barely had time to check his own takedowns of Aquaman and Green Arrow and confirm that one of his children had attached an \u2018Out\u2019 sticker to both their foreheads, before he spun and caught Wonder Woman\u2019s sword on his gauntlet.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cYour children are marvellous,\u201d she told him, a wide grin on her face.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">He let himself smile back, amused at the increased glee on Wonder Woman\u2019s face. \u201cI know.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">He ducked, and Wonder Woman started, just slightly, which unbalanced her when she ducked a moment later to doge Nightwing\u2019s kick. Nightwing crouched for just a moment, back pressed into Batman\u2019s shin, grinning wildly. Batman placed one heavy palm on his son\u2019s messy hair and then they moved.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Back and forth, sideways and zigzag, he and Nightwing pressed ever forward in a pattern they\u2019d been perfecting for years. They\u2019d worked for this smoothness, for this ability just to <em>know </em>where the other would be. They\u2019d worked to get it back after harsh words and changing styles had damaged what once had been instinctive.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Batman was the strong arm, the brute and ruthless force. Nightwing was the precision weapon, the sharp and relentless edge. They backed Wonder Woman up, step by step, until she stood almost back to back with Superman.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Superman was holding Red Hood up by the scrub of his coat, letting him dangle there with crossed arms. Clearly, the man didn\u2019t quite know what to do with Hood now that he was caught. This wasn\u2019t exactly an uncommon experience with Hood.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Nightwing, however, pivoted off Batman\u2019s back (exactly as Damian had done his, and Bruce hadn\u2019t teared up the first time he\u2019d seen them complete that manoeuvre, Tim and his photography were <em>lying</em>) to leap over Wonder Woman\u2019s head, land neatly on Superman\u2019s shoulders, and shove Kryptonite in his face.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Superman staggered, which released Hood just enough for the man to slip cuffs out of his coat and onto Superman\u2019s wrists. There was an \u2018Out\u2019 tag in blue and red marker on the cuffs with a note underneath saying \u2018We both know these could have been laced with Kryptonite; sit the fuck down.\u2019</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Wonder Woman continued her turn to track Nightwing and shifted in a move meant to free Superman. She halted half way when Black Bat tapped her on the shoulder and pointed to the \u2018Out\u2019 sticker Black Bat had placed on her skirt during Nightwing\u2019s showy move.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">With a laugh, Wonder Woman sat, dragging a bemused Superman down with her.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Batman turned to survey the rest of the chaos, and saw that it had mostly wrapped up. Martian Manhunter was also sitting calmly, tag on his cloak and smile on his face. Shazam was wrapped in some sort of jelly substance, sticker on his cheek. Black Canary was sitting against a wall, meta cuffs on her wrist and sticker on her boot.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Red Arrow and Wonder Girl were arguing with each other as Robin stuck a sticker to each of the arms, right over the reinforced rope that tied the two together. Aqualad had a gag over his mouth with an \u2018Out\u2019 tag hanging off it and was sitting at his mentor\u2019s feet and patting him on the leg in what was either meant to be a comforting or condescending manner.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cWell, I think that wraps things up nicely, don\u2019t you?\u201d Nightwing asked, coming to stand at Batman\u2019s side.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Batman eyed his son speculatively and waited. Spoiler dropped down from the ceiling, sack full of now purple weaponry clanking to the floor and drawing the attention of all the heroes. Except for Green Lantern, who Hood dropped next to the sack.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cNow we\u2019re wrapped up,\u201d Red Robin said as he approached with Black Bat and Signal trailing him.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Batman sighed.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cWhat. The. Fuck.\u201d Green Lantern glared at them all, but mostly Batman.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cTeamwork exercises.\u201d Nightwing sang at him.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cLet us go, you fucking nightmares.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Seven domino masks turned to look at Batman. Bruce crossed his arms because they clearly didn\u2019t need him to defend them. \u201cYou are nightmares.\u201d<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">There were various shrugs and grins, because they were self-aware nightmares and proud of the fact.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Dick leaned forward. \u201cNot until you admit we\u2019ve won.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Green Lantern grew red in the face as he drew breath to shout something that would be more effective if he wasn\u2019t tied up with something that looked like a child\u2019s yellow skipping rope. It wasn\u2019t, but one of Bruce\u2019s children had tied tassels to it for the express purpose of pissing Green Lantern off.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cOf course!\u201d Wonder Woman beat Green Lantern to speaking. \u201cWe certainly concede victory. Your teamwork was most excellent.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cAgreed,\u201d said Superman who raised his cuffed hands in a silent question. It took Bruce a bare moment to realize that all his kids were looking at him again, even Nightwing.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cYou\u2019ve had your fun. Release them.\u201d Bruce was rather proud that he didn\u2019t sigh or pinch the bridge of his nose. Or smile.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cDo we have to?\u201d Muttered Damian, but Cass and Tim were already setting the League members that needed freeing go, Stephanie following behind to hand out now purple weaponry to their respective owners.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Wonder Woman and Superman approached, apparently quite happy to go with the tacit agreement that Green Lantern would be released last.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cI have never seen you fight quite like that, Batman,\u201d said Diana, \u201cnot once over our many years of friendship.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cWell, I\u2019ve been fighting with him even longer than that,\u201d Dick said from Bruce\u2019s elbow.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cWhat?!\u201d Both Flashes popped up at their sides, heralding the crowding of everyone else.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cHow the heck do you all know each other.\u201d Hawkgirl was swinging her mace as she spoke, seemingly not too upset at it being purple.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cPlease tell me you noticed the bats.\u201d Tim was pinching his nose. \u201cAt least four of us literally have bats emblazoned across our chests. Please tell me one of you noticed that.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cI did,\u201d said Diana, slightly smug.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Clark nudged her in the side with his elbow. \u201cHey, I knew first.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cOnly cause I gave it to you, Uncle Supes,\u201d Dick said rather fondly.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cSmiling Batman,\u201d Barry muttered at Dick\u2019s expression, apparently ignoring the uncle part completely.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cCalled it!\u201d Wally shouted, beaming as he nudged his own uncle in the ribs.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cAlright over there, Flashes?\u201d Dick asked.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cI know you\u2019re aware that your generation calls you the smiling Batman,\u201d Bruce told his son, quite happy to ignore the way Clark was practically glowing at being called an uncle.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Dick smiled up at him. \u201cYup! Spent like three months trying to decide what to do if they confronted me about it.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Tim leaned around Jason. \u201cYou were going to gaslight them, right? Deny everything like you were utterly confused about what ever led them to that connection?\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cWell, yeah. Much more fun. But they all kept it to whispers behind my back. Like hearing the whispers behind your back wasn\u2019t Day One of Dad\u2019s Bat Training.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Bruce frowned because that was not Day One of Bat Training.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cDon\u2019t be stupid, Dickface. That\u2019s Week Six.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cThank you, Jason,\u201d Bruce said, because Jason wasn\u2019t wrong.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cJason!?\u201d Bruce tilted his head as he realized several of his children\u2019s voices had been in that mix.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cYes? I thought that was the second part of this. Weren\u2019t you making it impossible to hide you existence so you could reveal your identities?\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cYup.\u201d Nightwing bounced forward, draping himself over Bruce\u2019s back. \u201cHiding made sense when we were still vulnerable and young, but we\u2019re in a good place B. Time to step out of the shadows, just a bit.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Bruce hummed. But, well, Dick had always been pulling him out of the shadows.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">He turned to the Justice League, absently noting both speedsters practically vibrating and Clark and Diana both smiling at him with a warm softness that seemed all the brighter for the vernal shock the others were still operating under.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cDad\u2019s Bat Training. Batman is a father. He has <em>children</em>.\u201d Oliver said to Dinah in what was probably supped to be a whisper. He turned to Roy. \u201cWait, please tell me you didn\u2019t know about this?\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cNope.\u201d Roy said, glaring at an unrepentant Dick</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cThis is my oldest,\u201d Bruce started, ignoring them all, \u201cDick Grayson. He\u2019s an acrobatic barnacle.\u201d<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Jason and Tim both snorted, the older outright cackling, but Bruce could feel his oldest beam as he tightened his arms.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cB adopted me when I was a kid after I watched my birth parents die. I started young, but B saved me. And I saved him.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cRobin.\u201d All heads turned to a soft-eyed Wonder Woman who was looked between Nightwing and Damian with the R on his chest. \u201cWe thought he was a myth, a false legend. Particularly when a Robin appeared with the Titans and denied all connection to Gotham. But he was your <em>son.</em>\u201d<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cHe was. The League was still new and I didn\u2019t trust you yet. Not with him.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cRobin became a mantle.\u201d Dick smile, warmth genuine and not bladed as it had been for the last few weeks. \u201cJay had it for a while, then Tim, Steph, and now Damian.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cI only had it for coverage purposes!\u201d Steph piped up.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cStill counts,\u201d everyone else said, excepting Damian.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Damian crossed his arms. \u201cTt. You should take pride in your part of the esteemed legacy of Robin.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Dick let out a coo that made several of the heroes, probably ones he\u2019d kicked in the head, flinch. He released Bruce in order to pounce on Damian with a hug the boy might have escaped if it wasn\u2019t for Steph joining in.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Bruce sighed, but there was a fondness there that he knew Diana at least had caught. \u201cJason Todd, known as Red Hood, is my third eldest, but the second adopted.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cI stole the tires off the Batmobile,\u201d Jason told the room with a smirk as he removed his hood and mask.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cTimothy Drake, known as Red Robin, discovered our identities and was adopted shortly after.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cWe had to deal with his parents first!\u201d Chirped Dick to general alarm.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Tim side-eyed his brother before taking off his own mask and addressing the assembled heroes. \u201cI helped. They just signed over custody. Not like they really cared one way or another.\u201d<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Jason ruffled his hair and Duke patted him on the arm.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cDamian,\u201d Bruce continued, \u201cthe current Robin, is both an Al Ghul and a Wayne. He\u2019s the youngest and the only one biologically mine.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cThe Blood Son!\u201d Every single one of his children chorused with varying tones. Damian scoffed but didn\u2019t throw off Dick or Steph, even as Dick gently peeled away the boy\u2019s domino.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cStephanie Brown, currently known as Spoiler, isn\u2019t legally mine-\u201c</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cJust spiritually and financially!\u201d The girl thew in.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201c-and was an independent vigilante until Tim befriended her and brought her into the family.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cNo take backs.\u201d Tim and Dick agreed with a high-five over a giggling Steph\u2019s head.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cDuke Thomas, known as the Signal, is our newest addition. He\u2019s the only exception to the no metas in Gotham rule.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cNice to meet you,\u201d Duke told the Justice League, who looked a little awed at his manners. Duke must have seen that however, because he promptly ruined it after removing his mask. \u201cI\u2019m new, but I promise my initiation was very thorough.\u201d<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">This time Dick and Jason exchanged grins that had Garth taking a step behind a flabbergasted Arthur.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">There was a moment of silence before Diana grinned. \u201cAnd the last?\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Heads started turning as most of them realized there had been another. Cass dropped down from the ceiling next to Bruce, completely silent, startling a few others into retreating steps.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cCassandra Cain, known as Black Bat. She\u2019s my second eldest.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Cass patted his cheek before going to lean on Tim.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cBut,\u201d Bruce cut off a grinning Clark, \u201cthe last is actually Oracle, formally Batgirl.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cWait,\u201d Barry said. \u201cI thought Signal was the only other meta. Is Oracle invisible?\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cI\u2019m not,\u201d Barbara\u2019s voice came clearly through the speaker system. \u201cBarbara Gordon, at your service.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cShe\u2019s our tech goddess and you should always do as she says,\u201d Tim told the League earnestly.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cHello, Oracle,\u201d chorused every Titan in the room to the amusement of a grinning Nightwing.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cTitans,\u201d she acknowledged.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Dick shrugged as the League turned to him. \u201cBabs and I are best friends and the original Bats. She\u2019s never physically met the Titans but I wasn\u2019t about to lead a team she wasn\u2019t part of.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cCouldn\u2019t if you tried, Boy Blunder.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cTrue,\u201d Dick agreed happily.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cSo all this was to fucking introduce yourselves? To get Daddy Bats to spill your names to your friends?\u201d Hal asked, not sounding particularly pleased as a glob of paint rolled off his suit and puddled onto the floor. He had still not been handed back his ring and Bruce wasn\u2019t even sure which child had it. Jason wasn\u2019t currently smug enough to still have it in his possession.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Hal didn\u2019t notice each of the kids tense, but the other heroes certainly did.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cNo,\u201d Cass said.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cThis was because you insulted Batman,\u201d Tim continued.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cAnd that\u2019s our job.\u201d Jason leaned onto Tim\u2019s shoulder.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Dick stepped forward, the others fanning out loosely behind him, not quite threatening but explicitly supportive.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cYou fucked up,\u201d he told the Justice League. \u201cYou messed up a mission and instead of talking about it like adults, or even like the teenagers I\u2019ve trained, you took it out on one of your senior members. One of your friends.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">There was shifting feet and downward glances.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Dick stepped forward again and Bruce was absently impressed that Hal didn\u2019t step back.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cBatman is abrasive, authoritarian, reticent, secretive, and <em>kind. </em>He\u2019s given more to this team than you can possibly understand and I sat there and watched you ignore his input, blame him for following a plan you all agreed upon, and insult his every effort. Batman has worked with partners before the Justice League took down it\u2019s first mugger, and, though I\u2019m not sure you caught this with your selective hearing, he <em>adopted </em>a bunch of baby vigilantes to make sure we were safe and prepared and <em>never alone.\u201d</em></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Nightwing took another step forward, his demeanour still and sharp even as he didn\u2019t reach for a weapon. Not that he had to, what with six highly-trained and possibly trigger-happy siblings at his back.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cNo, Green Lantern. This wasn\u2019t an introduction, it was a threat. Get your act together or we\u2019re taking him back.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Nightwing stared at Hal for a long moment, making sure that the man had nothing to say. When Dick clapped his hands together and tossed Hal\u2019s ring back, three different heroes jumped, to the snickers of the Batfamily and sympathetic looks of the Titans.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cNot that we want that outcome. We\u2019re just so happy that B has friends!\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Bruce was too busy staring to refute that comment with his usual disdain. His children had just threatened, effectively, the entire Justice League. He was slightly put out but also very proud.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Tim was nodding. \u201cAlso. Agent A has prepared cookies, if anyone want to join us at the Manor.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cAnd you do,\u201d Dick told the Titans, \u201cbecause those are the cookies that you lot once literally destroyed a floor of the Tower over.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cAgent A?\u201d J\u2019onn asked, coming closer from where he\u2019d, quite intelligently, been lurking around the edges. \u201cIs there another child?\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">That actually made each of his children blink for a moment, before bursting out into various chuckles and guffaws. Even Damian was smirking.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cAgent A is my father,\u201d Bruce explained.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cWe would be honoured to meet you father.\u201d Diana clapped Bruce on his shoulder before linking their arms. \u201cI look forward to seeing your home and learning more about your wondrous children.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cWait a fucking second!\u201d Oliver yelled, Dinah\u2019s hand on his arm. All heads turned to him and he pointed at Bruce. \u201cBruce Wayne is Batman?!\u201d<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cOh my god, you absolute Dickhead,\u201d muttered Roy who\u2019d actually met all the Waynes at one gala or another.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cHuh,\u201d Dick smiled as his siblings fell into even deeper laughter. \u201cGuess we forgot that part.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Bruce sighed again, but he also smiled as he removed the cowl.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">(Bruce would get to write a very detailed status report about how wonderful his children were and make the entire Justice League read each and every page.)</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<b>Private<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></b>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Dick: <em>We\u2019re bringing home guests!</em></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Dick: <em>Mission accomplished.</em></p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Alfred: <em>Well done, Master Dick.</em></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Alfred: <em>Very well done, indeed.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span></em></p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n<b>(Purple) Heroes of the (Invaded) Tower</b>\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Shazam: <em>So if the Rancher King is fake, what happened to the cow?</em></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Shazam: <em>Did she go home?</em></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Black Canary:<em> And the Rancher King is fucking fake, right?</em></p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Nightwing: <em>Very fake.</em></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Nightwing: <em>Batcow\u00a0belongs to Robin and is currently getting pampered for her \u2018masterful performance.\u2019</em></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Nightwing: <em>Robin says you can come to the Batcave and visit her, Shazam.</em></p>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Shazam: <em>Yes please!</em></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Black Canary:<em> Batcow.</em></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Black Canary: <em>You know what?
