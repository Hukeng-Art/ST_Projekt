  "notes": "<p>Hello everyone! I ranted about my issues with this on tumblr the other day, and then last night I was in A Mood and decided I wanted to write a fic about it. If Recovery Girl is one of your faves, you probably won\u2019t enjoy this, so I\u2019d advise keeping that in mind before you decide to read! </p>\n<p>Obviously, there are parts of this that I took liberty with, hence the canon divergence tag. But the core of the scene that inspired the idea sticks to canon. </p>\n<p>Thanks to <a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/users/12Redsky34\" rel=\"nofollow\">Red</a> for beta reading!</p>\n<p class=\"jump\">(See the end of the work for <a href=\"#work_endnotes\">more notes</a>.)</p>\n<p>Wow, so uh, hi! A lot of you like this fic! Like, waaaaay more of you than I expected. I don\u2019t really know what to say other than thank you! </p>\n<p>This isn\u2019t a continuation of the main fic, but I felt inspired to write out two scenes that could have made it into the fic if I had chosen a different focus or route. I thought people might enjoy reading a few bonus scenes, just for fun! </p>\n<p>\n(See the end of the chapter for <a href=\"#chapter_2_endnotes\">more notes</a>.)\n</p>\n<p>In case anyone is wondering, I love Aoikaze with my entire heart. I will find a way to include him in one of my other fics and that is a <em>threat</em>. /j </p>\n<p>Anywho, I hope you enjoyed these bonus scenes! </p>\n<p>I had a lot of fun with this one, I hope y\u2019all enjoyed! </p>\n<p>main tumblr: <a href=\"https://liarielle.tumblr.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">liarielle</a><br>bnha tumblr: <a href=\"https://yamadadzawa.tumblr.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">yamadadzawa</a><br></p>",
  "text": "<p>The words still echo through Izuku\u2019s mind, and past the full body ache he felt coming out of surgery, there\u2019s something else now too. He\u2019s sweating, but it\u2019s nothing like what he feels after training. He\u2019s cold, and jittery, and the back of his neck prickles sharply, especially whenever Recovery Girl walks back into view. </p>\n<p>All Might had to leave a few minutes ago to change and get ready for the medals ceremony. A few other students ebb in and out of the medical center, and for some reason, Izuku finds himself watching Recovery Girl\u2019s interactions with them, analyzing every word, flinching at every admonishing tone. </p>\n<p>And Izuku knows this feeling, it\u2019d be impossible not to after carrying it for nearly a decade before coming to UA. But it\u2019s been months since it last happened so what... </p>\n<p>\u2018Just so you know, I won\u2019t be healing injuries like this anymore!\u2019 </p>\n<p><em>\u201cI\u2019m not going to keep doing this, Midoriya!\u201d</em> </p>\n<p>\u2018You need to find a better way for him to use his power, something less self destructive!\u2019</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cYou\u2019re always so clumsy! And you need to stop provoking those boys, it\u2019s your fault you keep getting hurt.\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>Oh. <em>Oh</em>. </p>\n<p>Izuku...forgot. He spent the first week or two on edge, trying to read his teachers the way he has every year since second grade. But that quickly fell to the side, in favor of updating his analysis entries on all of them. </p>\n<p>Izuku forgot. He\u2019s been so caught up in his hero worship that he forgot. The staff at UA are all heroes, but they\u2019re also <em>teachers</em>. And teachers don\u2019t like him. Up until now, he\u2019s been seeing Recovery Girl\u2019s actions towards him as scolding, exasperated maybe, yet still tinged with fondness towards a hero hopeful. </p>\n<p>But...was he wrong? Was he always one mistake away from-</p>\n<p>\u2018I won\u2019t be healing injuries like this anymore!\u2019 </p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cI won\u2019t waste any more time on you!\u201d </em>\n</p>\n<p>Izuku\u2019s vision grays at the edges, as he looks down at his scarred hands and wonders. Is it...just Recovery Girl? Or has Izuku missed the warning signs with all of his teachers? </p>\n<p>He remembers now, and he has to be careful. </p>\n<p>-----</p>\n<p>There\u2019s an awkward gap between choosing their hero names and waiting for internship week. Izuku\u2019s skin crawls under his uniform, and the bandages on his arms and hands itch unbearably, leave him flushed and overheated. </p>\n<p>His notes have been suffering so far today, as he loses focus on lectures to carefully note his teachers\u2019 expressions when they look at him, and their tone when they say his name. And the pain...Izuku forgot this too. The sore muscles and joints, a result of sitting tensed in his seat for hours. </p>\n<p>He used to be better at this, back in middle school. He knew how to keep a watch on his teacher, and his peers, and still keep his notes up to standard. He could anticipate shifts in tone, predict when attention would be fired his way, and prepare accordingly. It\u2019s been just over a month, and he\u2019s out of practice. So when Yamada-sensei calls on him to read the next phrase on the board, he jumps. Stupid. </p>\n<p>-----</p>\n<p>Hizashi knows some of the kids are all probably still worn out from the Sports Festival, even with the days off they had after. Especially the ones who made it to the third round, and <em>especially</em> Midoriya. He\u2019s doing his best to keep things light today, and he purposefully picked a few English tongue twisters for the kiddos to try out. Laughter is the best medicine after all. </p>\n<p>Midoriya is nervous, Hizashi can tell from the way he jumped when he called on the little listener, but his attempt is good! His tongue twister isn\u2019t easy, but he very nearly gets it. He just stumbles over a few words, and Hizashi laughs good naturedly, flashing the kid a big smile. </p>\n<p>\u201cYou almost had it, little listener!\u201d He praises. \u201cKeep practicing, and you\u2019ll get that one in no time!\u201d </p>\n<p>-----</p>\n<p>Izuku is burning as he sinks into his seat, Yamada-sensei\u2019s laughter still ringing sharply through his ears, echoed by the laughter of his classmates. </p>\n<p>\u2018You almost had it,\u2019 Yamada-sensei says. Izuku doesn\u2019t believe him. </p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cI suppose that\u2019s close enough.\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u2018Keep practicing, and you\u2019ll get that one in no time!\u2019 Past Yamada-sensei\u2019s smile, Izuku can\u2019t help but wonder if he\u2019s being mocked. </p>\n<p><em>\u201cKeep practicing Midoriya, maybe you\u2019ll have a chance to catch up with the rest of the class.\u201d</em> </p>\n<p>-----</p>\n<p>Out of all his coworkers, Ectoplasm prides himself on being the best at keeping a close eye on all twenty students at once. And no, not with the use of his quirk, though he did get good at it because of his quirk. Awareness of his surroundings and everyone in them comes naturally, but it\u2019s also a skill he\u2019s honed for years. Aizawa is the only one who may edge him out of that \u2018best\u2019 spot someday. </p>\n<p>So Ectoplasm can tell, just minutes after class begins, that Midoriya Izuku is having a bad day. He hasn\u2019t seen the boy this on edge or jittery since the first week of class. He makes a mental note to say something to Aizawa. For now, he keeps class moving, and calls on Midoriya when it\u2019s his turn. </p>\n<p>His stutter from that first week is back as well, and he won\u2019t look right at Ectoplasm. The man tries not to let that sting. Midoriya was the first child to ever look at him without a trace of fear the day they first met, and Ectoplasm thinks he understands now why some heroes like attention. </p>\n<p>Midoriya\u2019s answer is close, but he skipped a step towards the end of the problem, leaving him with the incorrect answer. Ectoplasm tells him this, as gently as he can. Instead of the usual determined spark in his eyes though, there\u2019s distress. Ectoplasm decides to let the kid have a break for the rest of the hour, and doesn\u2019t call on him again. </p>\n<p>-----</p>\n<p>Damn it, damn it, damn it! How could he have missed that step? Ectoplasm-sensei is ignoring him now, not even looking at him to answer another question, and Izuku feels like his chest is full of wasps. </p>\n<p>He can do better, he knows he can do better, but sensei won\u2019t look at him, won\u2019t call on him, won\u2019t let him try again. </p>\n<p><em>\u201cI gave you your chance Midoriya. I have other students to teach, you know.\u201d</em> </p>\n<p>Izuku curls a hand over the back of his head and ducks his face down, keeping his eyes on his notes. If sensei is in the mood to ignore him, he needs to stay small. Shame curls in his gut, and Izuku tries to ignore the feeling of his classmates\u2019 eyes burning into him. </p>\n<p>-----</p>\n<p>Something is wrong with Midoriya. Shouta wouldn\u2019t have needed Ectoplasm\u2019s note to figure that out, he just <em>knows</em>. The kid is curled in on himself, his hands are shaking, and his lip is bitten raw. Shouta\u2019s seen him anxious before, but never this bad. He has two options here, and he wrestles between them, weighing the consequences of each. He can let Midoriya participate in the exercise, and see if the activity coaxes that spark of determination out of him. Or he can have the kid sit out, give him a break and some time to himself. </p>\n<p>While Shouta is deciding what to do, and the kids are waiting for instructions, Kaminari and Kirishima say something that gets to Bakugou, and the boy pops off a few small explosions in their direction to make his anger known. Midoriya flinches, and that makes Shouta\u2019s decision for him. If the kid is this on edge right now, it\u2019s not safe for him to participate. He could get hurt. </p>\n<p>Rather than single the kid out and remove him in front of everyone, Shouta explains the exercise and sends the brats to the locker rooms to change. Before Midoriya can leave, Shouta subtly gets his attention and motions him over. </p>\n<p>Midoriya\u2019s shoulders hunch as he walks over, and his hands twist and bunch together in front of him, which can\u2019t be good for him after what happened at the Sports Festival. Shouta reaches out and taps lightly on Midoriya\u2019s hand, frowning when the kid freezes and tenses. </p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t do that,\u201d Shouta scolds, as gently as he can. Midoriya nods and puts his hands at his sides, and Shouta notices that he stills almost entirely, save for some small twitches here and there. Shouta sighs and lays a hand on the kid\u2019s shoulder. </p>\n<p>\u201cYou seem pretty wound up today,\u201d Shouta says. \u201cIs everything alright?\u201d Midoriya\u2019s mouth thins into a tight line, and he nods firmly. </p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m fine, sensei,\u201d he replies, a faint tremble in his voice. Shouta frowns. </p>\n<p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d Shouta presses. \u201cIf there\u2019s anything wrong, you can tell me. If I can\u2019t help you myself, I\u2019ll find someone who can. Okay?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, sensei,\u201d Midoriya whispers. \u201cBut I\u2019m fine.\u201d Hmm. Shouta will have to stop pressing, for now at least. </p>\n<p>\u201cAlright,\u201d He relents. \u201cBut I think you should sit out today. This exercise requires a lot of focus, and I\u2019m worried you\u2019ll get hurt.\u201d Shouta likes to think he knows Midoriya pretty well by now, so he\u2019s expecting a burst of energy, fists clenched at his sides, loud, passionate protesting. That\u2019s not what happens. </p>\n<p>Midoriya...<em>wilts</em>. His face just barely starts to crumple before he seems to catch himself and smooths it out. </p>\n<p>\u201cYes, sensei,\u201d he repeats, even quieter than before. Shouta wonders for a moment if the kid even spoke. Something is <em>wrong</em>, and Shouta has to admit, it\u2019s scaring him a little. He squeezes the kid\u2019s shoulder lightly. </p>\n<p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you go see Recovery Girl?\u201d He suggests. \u201cMaybe some rest will do you good.\u201d Midoriya nods, so Shouta writes him a note and sends him on his way. </p>\n<p>He has a hard time getting that small, quiet voice out of his head for the rest of the day. </p>\n<p>-----</p>\n<p>He knows. </p>\n<p>\u2018I think you should sit out today.\u2019</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cMidoriya, go sit on the bench. You\u2019re not joining today.\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u2018I\u2019m worried you\u2019ll get hurt.\u2019</p>\n<p><em>\u201cYou\u2019re just going to get hurt if you try to play like everyone else. You\u2019re too fragile.\u201d</em> </p>\n<p>Aizawa-sensei knows. Aizawa-sensei is like <em>them</em>. </p>\n<p>No! No, that can\u2019t be right. Aizawa-sensei saved them, protected them at the USJ. He still wears the proof of his care for them on his body. Maybe he hates Izuku, like the rest of them, but he\u2019s still, he\u2019s not like them. He can\u2019t be. </p>\n<p>Izuku doesn\u2019t want to see Recovery Girl. He\u2019s not injured from his quirk, but he still feels guilty, and he\u2019s scared that she\u2019ll grow even more tired of him if he\u2019s back in her office so soon. He\u2019s done nothing but make mistakes today, he can\u2019t keep doing this! </p>\n<p>He has to be better. He has to <em>do</em> better. </p>\n<p>He stops as he\u2019s passing one of the training facilities. Eta, he thinks. It\u2019s a large building filled with smaller training rooms, fit for individuals or small groups. Izuku peers through the window, and doesn\u2019t see anyone working a check-in area or anything. He tries the door, and the air in his chest rushes out in a gasp when it opens. He steps inside and starts looking around, until he ends up walking down the hall that has the individualized rooms. He sees one that\u2019s empty and approaches it. </p>\n<p>His heart hammers at his throat, and he tries the door. Locked. Damn it! It\u2019s then that he notices a spot for his ID to scan, and he realizes that students probably have to reserve a room, to get keyed in. No matter how much he wants to try his ID on the door, he knows it\u2019s not a good idea. </p>\n<p>\u201cTrying to sneak in some extra training?\u201d A voice startles him from behind, and Izuku yelps. He whirls around to see an older boy, a second or third year, grinning at him. </p>\n<p>\u201cWh- uh, no!\u201d Izuku waves his hands frantically. \u201cI was just looking, honest!\u201d The boy laughs and shakes his head. </p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t look so nervous, I\u2019m not gonna get you in trouble!\u201d He nudges Izuku to the side and swipes his ID on the door. \u201cYou were pretty badass in the Festival. So I don\u2019t mind giving you my hour.\u201d The door beeps and the boy opens it for Izuku. \u201cJust try not to break anything, okay? I\u2019d rather not get in trouble with Snipe-sensei.\u201d </p>\n<p>Izuku tries to argue, but the boy just places a hand between his shoulders and pushes him into the room. Izuku realizes that any resistance his feet should have made as he dug them into the ground seems to have done nothing. Negated by the boy\u2019s touch? By the time he turns around to gush about the boy\u2019s quirk, he\u2019s gone, the door swinging shut behind him. </p>\n<p>Izuku turns back around and looks at the room. It\u2019s small compared to the rest of the facility, but it\u2019s still probably bigger than all of the rooms in his apartment combined. There\u2019s equipment stored neatly along one of the walls, along with some training dummies. Izuku sets his bag down and shrugs out of his uniform jacket and dress shirt, down to his undershirt. He moves one of the dummies to the center of the room, and secures it in place. </p>\n<p>He starts with some warmups and stretching, and then cycles through some basic exercises, not using his quirk yet. It feels good to burn off some of this energy, to work his nerves and anger out on the dummy. But that only lasts for so long, before Izuku\u2019s mind starts to catch up with him. </p>\n<p>As he starts thinking about how to use his quirk without hurting himself, he wonders what Aizawa-sensei told the rest of the class when they returned from the lockers and he wasn\u2019t there. <em>Did anyone even notice?</em> A pitiful part of his mind whispers. </p>\n<p>Of course they did! Iida and Uraraka would notice, at the very least. But what did Aizawa-sensei tell them? That he was too weak to join them? Too fragile? That they had to be careful with him since he\u2019s quirkless-</p>\n<p>That\u2019s not <em>now</em>. That\u2019s not Aizawa-sensei. He doesn\u2019t know, and even if he did...</p>\n<p>If he did...what would he say? How would he treat Izuku? How would any of them treat him if they knew? Would they still want to be his friend? Would they still smile at him, accept him for all of his weird habits? Kacchan could tell them, but he hasn\u2019t. But what if he did? Why hasn\u2019t he? </p>\n<p>None of them know yet, but Yamada-sensei still made fun of him. Ectoplasm-sensei still ignored him. Aizawa-sensei still figured out that he\u2019s weak. Recovery Girl still...still grew tired of helping him. Won\u2019t help him anymore, because if he gets hurt, it\u2019s his own fault. </p>\n<p>And he does. Get hurt, that is. He\u2019s so tangled in his thoughts, so tightly wound, that when he tries to break free, he accidentally uses One for All for a split second when he throws his next punch at the dummy. Thankfully, nothing in the room breaks. </p>\n<p>Izuku\u2019s left wrist isn\u2019t so lucky. He\u2019s broken enough bones by now to know that it\u2019s almost certainly broken. He keens quietly, and cradles his wrist close to his chest, tears stinging his eyes. The Eta Facility isn\u2019t too far from Recovery Girl\u2019s office, it\u2019s just a short walk and then-</p>\n<p>Then nothing. He can\u2019t go to her. She\u2019ll be able to tell, she\u2019ll know he hurt himself with his quirk again, and she <em>told</em> him. She won\u2019t heal injuries like this anymore. He has to deal with this on his own. </p>\n<p>There\u2019s a first aid kit in the room, and he gets lucky. There\u2019s a wrist brace, along with a cold pack. He unwraps the bandages that were already on his wrist, leftover from the Sports Festival, and awkwardly gets the brace on and into place. He whimpers quietly whenever he jostles his wrist too much, and winces at the cold after he snaps the pack and places it down over his wrist. Then he carefully and clumsily wraps the bandages back into place. </p>\n<p>It\u2019s a bit messy, and bulky because of the brace under it, but Izuku is pretty sure that once his uniform sleeve is covering it, he\u2019ll be able to keep it hidden. </p>\n<p>Getting his dress shirt and uniform jacket back on is a slow and painful process, his wrist throbbing sharply in time with his hammering heartbeat. And Izuku...he\u2019s been in pain before. He\u2019s had pain worse than this before. But something, some child-like instinct, still has him crouch in the corner of the room by his bag, crying quietly as he rocks himself. </p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t know if he can do this. If he can work around broken bones, until he finds a way to use his quirk without hurting himself anymore. And he has to. All Might has said plenty of times, he doesn\u2019t know what\u2019s different for Izuku, why Izuku is struggling to control this power when he was able to use it at 100% from the very beginning. Izuku knows, though. </p>\n<p>It\u2019s because All Might is strong, and worthy, and Izuku isn\u2019t. Maybe the quirk knows. Maybe One for All feels cheated, being stolen from the Symbol of Peace by a weak, quirkless kid. He\u2019ll have to earn it then. Earn the right to use this quirk, get stronger through the pain until it stops hurting. He\u2019s been doing that since he was four years old, he can do it a little longer. </p>\n<p>Izuku makes sure the room is set back the way he found it before he leaves. By the time he gets back to the classroom, Aizawa-sensei and the others are back too, filing into the room. Izuku can feel everyone\u2019s eyes on him, Aizawa-sensei\u2019s especially. </p>\n<p>He needs to do better, <em>be</em> better. He has to. </p>\n<p>-----</p>\n<p>Something about Midoriya is still off when he rejoins the class, and it nags Shouta all through the night. He hounds his fellow teachers before he leaves that day, asking for every detail they can remember about the classes they taught, trying to piece together what might be wrong. They all say the same things. Midoriya seemed down, or off, so in their own ways, they tried to encourage him, if appropriate, or give him space otherwise. </p>\n<p>Shouta can\u2019t ignore the feeling that he\u2019s missing something. Something important that will make everything else make sense. The feeling is still with him the following day, and seeing Midoriya when he walks into homeroom only makes it worse. The kid looks miserable. Or rather, to the untrained eye, he looks normal. But his smile is strained, his eyes carry pain, and Shouta can tell the kid doesn\u2019t want to be here. </p>\n<p>There\u2019s an ugly thought forming in Shouta\u2019s head, one he hopes isn\u2019t true. Midoriya\u2019s mood seemed to shift after they returned to school, after the Sports Festival. And now, the kid is definitely hurt and in pain, even if Shouta can\u2019t figure out where. There are two theories in Shouta\u2019s mind. </p>\n<p>Midoriya spends an unusual amount of time with All Might outside of class, and met with the man frequently leading up to the Sports Festival. Shouta doesn\u2019t like the idea that the Number One hero would belittle and hurt a child for failing to win, but he can\u2019t dismiss it as a possibility, even if it seems ridiculous. </p>\n<p>The other possibility, of course, is that someone at home hurt Midoriya. Either because of his performance in the Festival, or for some other reason. Shouta thinks that\u2019s the more likely possibility, as much as he hates the thought. He\u2019s no stranger to abused kids, but it\u2019s always harder when it\u2019s one of his students. Especially one that he has a mild soft spot for. </p>\n<p>He sends a discreet message to his coworkers asking them to keep an eye on the kid leading up to lunch. It\u2019s much the same as yesterday, though they do mention that the kid seems a bit more lively and determined today. They see it as a positive thing, but to Shouta, it\u2019s dangerous. He remembers that small, quiet voice from yesterday, the way the kid curled in on himself. Midoriya may just be more determined to hide his problems today. </p>\n<p>Shouta enters the classroom just as the bell releases the students for lunch and approaches his desk at the front of the room. He tries for the most casual approach he can. </p>\n<p>\u201cMidoriya, stick around for just a minute,\u201d he calls out. He watches through his hair as Midoriya tenses and nods, and though he smiles at the teasing from his classmates, it\u2019s even more strained than it was this morning. After everyone has finally filed out, Shouta walks to the door and closes it, seeing Midoriya flinch from the corner of his eye. </p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re not in trouble,\u201d Shouta says gently, frowning when his words don\u2019t seem to help at all. Midoriya nods politely and shifts in his seat. </p>\n<p>\u201cWhat, um, what did you want to talk about?\u201d He asks, voice raising in pitch towards the end of his question. Shouta walks over and stands near Midoriya\u2019s desk, leaning against Sero\u2019s. </p>\n<p>\u201cI wanted to ask you again if everything is alright,\u201d Shouta begins carefully. He holds up a hand to halt whatever answer the kid was going to give. \u201cBecause I think you\u2019re in pain.\u201d There, Midoriya definitely flinched at that, as minute as it was. \u201cKid, I\u2019m trying to help.\u201d Midoriya gnaws on his lip for a moment before he finally answers. </p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m just a little sore,\u201d he says. The words sound careful, measured. \u201cFrom the Sports Festival. I wasn\u2019t expecting it to still hurt a bit, but I guess it makes sense. I did have surgery this time.\u201d And that? That\u2019s <em>news</em> to Shouta. His eyebrows raise and he steps closer to the kid\u2019s desk. </p>\n<p>\u201cSurgery?\u201d He repeats, testing the word. Midoriya looks up at him and nods, confusion and wariness in his eyes. </p>\n<p>\u201cOn, um, on my arm, and my hand,\u201d Midoriya explains, a faint tremor in his voice now. Shouta wasn\u2019t informed of that, and it bothers him. He looks at the boy's arms and hands, and it\u2019s then that he notices the way Midoriya is holding his left wrist. He doesn\u2019t think first. He steps closer, reaches out, and takes the boy\u2019s wrist in his hand. His grip isn\u2019t tight, but it is somewhat firm, and Midoriya...</p>\n<p>He whimpers, and reacts with a full body flinch, curling in on himself...but he doesn\u2019t pull away. He leaves his wrist in Shouta\u2019s grip, despite the way his arm trembles, despite the fact that it\u2019s definitely Shouta\u2019s grip that\u2019s hurting him. Shouta releases him immediately, and meets the boy\u2019s eyes. Midoriya looks so <em>wrong</em>. Hurt, betrayed, afraid. Afraid of <em>him</em>. </p>\n<p>\u201cMidoriya,\u201d Shouta says softly, slowly crouching so he can better see the boy\u2019s face. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, kid. I didn\u2019t mean to hurt you. I didn\u2019t realize it was...injured.\u201d Midoriya\u2019s mouth trembles, and he looks like he wants to believe Shouta. \u201cWill you show me? My hands will stay right here.\u201d Shouta places his hands on his own knees, keeping them visible. After some time, Midoriya relents and nods. </p>\n<p>The kid shrugs out of his uniform jacket and awkwardly unwraps the bandage from around his wrist. Shouta wants nothing more than to help, but he has to do this on the boy\u2019s terms. He can\u2019t stop the hissing breath he sucks in through his teeth when he sees the brace that\u2019s under the bandages, and the dark bruising around the kid\u2019s wrist. </p>\n<p>\u201cOh, kid,\u201d Shouta whispers brokenly. \u201cAlright. Let\u2019s get you to Recovery Girl.\u201d </p>\n<p>If Shouta thought the kid\u2019s flinch when he grabbed his wrist was bad, it\u2019s <em>nothing</em> compared to the flinch he sees now, or the way Midoriya shakes his head and shrinks back in his seat. Shouta settles back down on his heels and tries to puzzle this out. He can\u2019t. </p>\n<p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want to go to Recovery Girl?\u201d Shouta asks carefully. Midoriya ducks his face down, hair shielding his eyes, but it doesn\u2019t stop Shouta from seeing the tears that drip down his chin. </p>\n<p>\u201cCan\u2019t,\u201d Midoriya\u2019s voice is hoarse, and broken. Shouta\u2019s hands shake a little against his thighs. </p>\n<p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cSh-She said, I-, she won\u2019t heal injuries like this anymore,\u201d Midoriya chokes out between quiet hitching breaths, near sobs. Shouta\u2019s blood boils so quickly that it runs cold, and he can\u2019t control himself. He can\u2019t stop the dangerous tone that enters his voice. </p>\n<p>\u201cShe said <em><strong>what</strong></em>?\u201d He hisses. Midoriya flinches, but before Shouta can apologize, the kid seems to figure out Shouta isn\u2019t angry at him. </p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s my fault,\u201d he whimpers, and Shouta <em>hates</em> those words, always hates those words when they come from the mouth of a child, but never has he hated them this much. \u201cI\u2019m the one who keeps breaking my bones. I have to find a better way.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cMidor...Izuku, please look at me,\u201d Shouta begs, voice shaking with his anger. Midoriya lifts his head, just enough to meet Shouta\u2019s eyes through the fringe of his hair. \u201cThere is <em>no</em> excuse for withholding medical treatment from anyone, especially a child. It doesn\u2019t matter how you got hurt. It is Recovery Girl\u2019s job to treat you. We all have to face consequences for our actions, but there is no reason why you should have to suffer like this for yours. You have done nothing wrong. Will you let me take you to the staff room?\u201d </p>\n<p>Midoriya begins to tremble about halfway through Shouta\u2019s speech, and jerks his head down in a nod when he\u2019s done. Shouta stands and stays close when Midoriya follows suit, grabbing the kid\u2019s uniform jacket and bag for him. </p>\n<p>Shouta leads him down to the staff room, and tucks him into his private office. He gets the kid seated on his couch, and after some gentle coaxing, has Midoriya hand over his wrist so Shouta can get the brace on properly. He also gives him some ice, and an appropriate dose of a good painkiller. </p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll be back in just a few minutes,\u201d Shouta says. \u201cUntil then, I\u2019ll make sure Mic knows not to let anyone in here, okay?\u201d Midoriya sniffles quietly and nods. Before Shouta leaves, he reaches behind the couch for one of his comfy blankets, handing it to the kid. He closes the door on the sight of Midoriya wrapping himself in the soft fabric, and turns around to face Hizashi. </p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell anyone he\u2019s in there, and keep them out,\u201d Shouta says. Hizashi, who before Shouta spoke, looked like he wanted to tease him, now sobers and frowns. </p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve seen you this angry in a long time,\u201d Hizashi sounds worried. \u201cIs everything alright?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Shouta replies through grit teeth. \u201cBut I\u2019m handling it.\u201d Hizashi accepts that and squeezes his shoulder. </p>\n<p>\u201cOkay,\u201d he says. \u201cJust remember that I\u2019m here if you need me.\u201d Shouta nods sharply. </p>\n<p>\u201cI know, that\u2019s why you\u2019re guarding the kid for me,\u201d Shouta reminds him. Hizashi smiles and bumps his fist against Shouta\u2019s shoulder, stepping aside to let him leave. </p>\n<p>-----</p>\n<p>Shouta enters Recovery Girl\u2019s office, and his temper flares when he sees she\u2019s not there, before he remembers that she\u2019s likely at lunch. He\u2019s just about to turn around and march through the school to find her, when he has a different thought. He steps the rest of the way into her office, and lets the door close behind him. </p>\n<p>Her computer isn\u2019t locked, so Shouta opens her files and looks through the first year student folders until he finds Midoriya\u2019s. It\u2019s empty. Shouta\u2019s stomach twists, and he looks around the office, eyes catching on a filing cabinet with a lock in the far corner. It takes him a few minutes to pick, and he finds a folder of paper files for Midoriya stashed in the back of the drawer. </p>\n<p>He flips through and begins to read, and tries to make sense of everything through his ever growing rage. </p>\n<p>For starters, not one of Midoriya\u2019s injuries since the start of the term seem to have been reported to his mother. Her signature is missing from every single incident report, replaced instead with Recovery Girl\u2019s. </p>\n<p>Even worse, the consent form for Izuku\u2019s surgery seems to have been signed by All Might and Nedzu. Shouta doesn\u2019t understand what the fuck is going on, but whatever it is can\u2019t be good. </p>\n<p>But what really catches Shouta\u2019s eye are the pages of notes on Midoriya\u2019s injuries. Comments about his quirk, theorizing why it keeps injuring him the way it does. Comparing it to...to All Might, and his use of his quirk when he was Midoriya\u2019s age. </p>\n<p>Once again, Shouta feels like something is missing. Something that would connect these dots into a full picture, instead of the muddy image they are now. But he doubts he\u2019ll get those answers if he asks nicely. No. Shouta has no intention of asking. He closes the folder and the filing cabinet, and takes the folder with him as he leaves Recovery Girl\u2019s office. </p>\n<p>He returns to the staff room to find it, thankfully, still empty besides Hizashi. He steps into his office, and softens when he sees that Midoriya has fallen asleep, curled up on the couch in Shouta\u2019s blanket. </p>\n<p>Immediate problem first, he needs to get the kid some proper treatment for his wrist. Then they can deal with the file. He opens the folder and flips to the front page, then takes out his phone and dials the number listed. </p>\n<p>\u201cHello?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMidoriya-san,\u201d Shouta says politely. \u201cMy name is Aizawa Shouta, I\u2019m your son\u2019s homeroom teacher at UA. I need a few minutes of your time.\u201d</p>\n<p>-----</p>\n<p>Shouta should have known his phone conversation with Midoriya-san would be longer than a few minutes. Despite how much he was buzzing with impatience, he understood why she was crying so much. He can\u2019t imagine how difficult it would be to learn that your child was injured and kept it hidden from you. He gained her permission to take Midoriya to a hospital for some treatment, after which he\u2019ll take the boy home, so he can sit down with Midoriya-san and show her everything else. </p>\n<p>Midoriya seems nervous about going to the hospital, until Shouta reassures him that he\u2019s been treated there before. Predictably, the boy is fascinated by the quirk used to heal the worst of his injury, flower petals that bloom and cover the doctor\u2019s hand before she touches his wrist, and the petals glow until the healing is complete. He\u2019s left with some minor bruising and aching, with instructions to take it easy and ice the area until the bruising heals. </p>\n<p>His excitement quickly drains when he remembers that Shouta is bringing him home. More than once during the train ride, Shouta has to remind him to not twist his hands together. As they climb the stairs to Midoriya\u2019s floor, Shouta begins to wonder if he\u2019s misjudged the situation. He stops Midoriya in the hall before they reach his door. </p>\n<p>\u201cKid,\u201d Shouta says. \u201cIs your mom...does she hurt you? Is that why you\u2019re nervous?\u201d Midoriya\u2019s eyes widen in a way that would be comical in any other situation. </p>\n<p>\u201cNo!\u201d He yelps, quickly clapping a hand over his mouth to stifle the sound, removing it a moment later and lowering his volume. \u201cNo. Mom has never hurt me, I promise, sensei. She\u2019s...she\u2019s the best. I just, it\u2019s. There\u2019s so much I haven\u2019t told her, and I\u2019m scared she might want to pull me out of UA.\u201d Honestly, Shouta wouldn\u2019t blame her if she did. But he doesn\u2019t say that out loud. Instead, he nods and squeezes the boy\u2019s shoulder reassuringly. </p>\n<p>\u201cI understand,\u201d Shouta nods. \u201cI just had to be sure.\u201d Midoriya sounds relieved when he sighs, and he lets Shouta into the apartment when they reach the door. Midoriya-san predictably fusses over her son, still teary eyed from earlier it seems, though she is quick to offer Shouta some tea as well. Shouta doesn\u2019t much care either way, but he accepts, because he imagines the social niceties will help calm her. </p>\n<p>They sit in the living room together, with cups of tea, and some cookies on a tray. Shouta opens the folder he took from Recovery Girl\u2019s office, and hands over some of the files. </p>\n<p>\u201cI need you to tell me if you were ever contacted about any of these injuries,\u201d Shouta says. Midoriya\u2019s eyes widen again, and Shouta can\u2019t help but split his attention between the boy and his mother. Tears glide over Midoriya-san\u2019s cheeks as she reads, shaking her head. She looks at her son, and Shouta can see how much she\u2019s trying not to look betrayed. </p>\n<p>\u201cIzuku, why...why didn\u2019t you tell me about this?\u201d </p>\n<p>Midoriya looks down at his lap and shrugs, then shakes his head. Shouta frowns and hands over another file to his mother. </p>\n<p>\u201cAnd...this?\u201d He asks. Midoriya-san presses her hand to her mouth this time, stifling a sob as she reads about the surgery performed on her son less than a week ago. The boy in question squeezes his eyes shut and flinches at the sound of his mother\u2019s crying. Shouta wants the answer now. He wants whatever that missing piece is, because it feels closer than ever, yet simultaneously like it might slip from his hands without warning. </p>\n<p>\u201cRecovery Girl has several pages on your son\u2019s quirk, and the injuries it has caused him,\u201d Shouta says carefully. \u201cAnd the reason I\u2019m here at all, is because after his surgery, she apparently told him she would no longer heal injuries caused by his quirk.\u201d </p>\n<p>Midoriya-san <em>breaks</em>. She presses both hands to her mouth and curves down over herself, her body shaking with the force of her cries. Midoriya\u2019s eyes snap open, flooded with guilt as he watches his mother cry, frozen next to her. Shouta raises from his seat and crosses over to crouch in front of them, looking up at the mother. </p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s happening,\u201d Shouta admits, as much as it pains him. \u201cBut I want to help. Something here isn\u2019t right. And Recovery Girl, All Might, even Principal Nedzu, they\u2019re all in on it.\u201d Shouta glances at Midoriya, sees him still unmoving, every bit of him still screaming his guilt. He knows something, but Shouta doesn\u2019t know how to ask. </p>\n<p>\u201cSh-She was, was the one who called me,\u201d Midoriya-san\u2019s breath hitches as she cries. \u201cTo tell me about Izuku\u2019s quirk, when it came in at the entrance exam.\u201d Shouta stiffens and stares between them. </p>\n<p>\u201cWhen it...<em>what</em>?\u201d Shouta barely breathes. Midoriya is shaking now, hands fisted in the fabric of his pants. </p>\n<p>\u201cI know,\u201d Midoriya-san says. \u201cIt sounds crazy, but my boy was quirkless until then, we were sure of it. We had the x-ray of his foot and everything. And then, Recovery Girl, she called, and said Izuku had manifested a quirk. She said it must have been dormant, until his body was strong enough to use it. She...\u201d Midoriya-san\u2019s voice softens, and she sounds like she\u2019s far away from them as she speaks. \u201cShe strongly discouraged me from taking Izuku to a specialist for a second opinion. She told me it would just be a waste of money. I believed her, because she\u2019s a hero. I <em>believed</em> her, and now, all of this, I...\u201d </p>\n<p>Shouta is still watching Midoriya, watching the way he shakes, and flinches, and his eyes dart towards the door like he\u2019s thinking of running. Shouta reaches out, slowly, and lays a hand over one of Midoriya\u2019s. The boy startles violently, looking down at Shouta with wild eyes. </p>\n<p>\u201cIzuku,\u201d Shouta says softly, rubbing his thumb over the boy\u2019s hand. Over his scars. \u201cPlease.\u201d Midoriya bows his head, eyes squeezing shut again, as his mother realizes what Shouta does, that her son has answers. Her hands hover and dance over his form, ghosting across his arm and his cheek, brushing hair back from his eyes. Shouta continues to stroke his knuckles, both of them giving gentle comfort, trying to coax the boy into speaking. </p>\n<p>\u201cAll Might,\u201d Midoriya finally whispers, barely breathing the man\u2019s name. \u201cI got my quirk from All Might.\u201d </p>\n<p>It shouldn\u2019t make sense, because it doesn\u2019t. Except it <em>does</em>. Shouta may not know exactly what it means, but the dots all suddenly snap together, into a clear, and enraging picture. </p>\n<p>He tells them then. Of a quirk that stockpiles power, passed from one person to the next. Of eight users before him, all champions of justice, including the man himself, All Might. How they met, what happened on the roof, with the sludge villain, how All Might then offered the boy his quirk, and trained him to prepare for it. </p>\n<p>All the while, Shouta and Midoriya-san are careful to stay gentle with him, even as anger burns in their eyes. The boy is exhausted when he finishes, and Shouta retreats to let Midoriya-san convince her son to go to his room for a nap. When she returns, she all but collapses onto the couch, and Shouta joins her. </p>\n<p>For a long time, nearly an hour, both of them are silent. They sit, side by side, stewing in their rage. At All Might, for training a child for this power that breaks his body, without ever thinking to involve the boy\u2019s mother, or Shouta, once he started at UA. At Recovery Girl, for keeping All Might\u2019s secret, and for hiding the boy\u2019s injuries from his mother so she wouldn\u2019t pull him from UA, because he needed to stay with All Might. With Nedzu, for allowing it all, for reasons still unknown to them. Shouta is the one to finally break the silence. </p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll help you,\u201d he murmurs. \u201cIf you want to...\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSue?\u201d Midoriya-san finishes for him, matching his volume. He nods. He means it. She\u2019s well within her rights to sue, and Shouta can\u2019t bring himself to think of a single reason why she shouldn\u2019t. </p>\n<p>\u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d Midoriya-san whispers. \u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d Shouta\u2019s mouth twists down, and he wants to shake her, to take this timid woman by the shoulders and demand to know <em>why</em>. Instead, he turns his head to look at her, and she does the same to look at him. He doesn\u2019t need to ask. </p>\n<p>\u201cThose villains, they\u2019re already targeting UA,\u201d Midoriya-san says. \u201cTargeting All Might. Izuku could be a target too. If I...if I do that, if it got out, what they did, it could ruin them. And I don\u2019t want to care, but I...it would give those villains what they want. And I would be taking All Might away from Izuku, and he\u2019s the only one who actually understands this quirk. I would be putting so many people in danger. What if the villains went after more kids, while the school is breaking? What if they found out about Izuku, or...\u201d She doesn\u2019t finish, but Shouta understands. He can see the logic. Too many innocents could be hurt and put in danger, for the sake of one kid. One family. But fuck, aren\u2019t they <em>enough</em>? </p>\n<p>\u201cSomething has to change,\u201d Shouta says. \u201cIt can\u2019t go on like this. I won\u2019t let it.\u201d Midoriya-san smiles weakly at him, and reaches out to pat his hand. </p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re a good man, Aizawa-san.\u201d </p>\n<p>-----</p>\n<p>Mom and Aizawa-sensei have been in a room meeting with Principal Nedzu, All Might, and Recovery Girl for hours. The room is definitely sound proofed. Izuku has tried pressing his ear to the door, to try and hear something, anything. His only reward had been silence, so he now sits on a couch in the staff room, trying to get some of his homework done. He doesn\u2019t know if he made the right choice, telling Mom and Aizawa-sensei the truth, but he didn\u2019t know what else to do. </p>\n<p>He jumps when the door finally opens, and Aizawa-sensei walks out. No one else joins them, even as Aizawa-sensei drops down on the couch next to him with a heavy sigh. Izuku bites at his lip and fidgets, trying to work up the courage to apologize. </p>\n<p>\u201cYour mom is a lot scarier than I gave her credit for,\u201d Aizawa-sensei murmurs. Izuku looks at him, as the man puts his eye drops in, and can\u2019t help a small smile. </p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve heard that before,\u201d Izuku replies. Aizawa-sensei chuckles and nods. </p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, I bet,\u201d he groans as he sits up and stretches, and then he finally looks at Izuku. \u201cRecovery Girl is going to retire.\u201d Izuku goes numb with shock and guilt, tears stinging his eyes. Aizawa-sensei brushes away some that fall with his thumb. \u201cIt\u2019s not your fault, kid. She...she made a lot of mistakes. She says she never actually intended to withhold treatment from you, and I believe her, but...she never should have told you she wouldn\u2019t. We\u2019re lucky it was just a broken wrist you tried to hide.\u201d Izuku ducks his head down and fights back more tears. </p>\n<p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t seem fair,\u201d he admits. \u201cFor her to leave, when Principal Nedzu and All Might...\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTrust me, they\u2019re on thin fucking ice,\u201d Aizawa-sensei growls, and Izuku stares at him in shock. The man at least looks embarrassed about his outburst. \u201cUh. Sorry. What I mean is, your mom is still laying into them pretty good. They\u2019ll have to meet her terms. Recovery Girl chose to retire on her own.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d Izuku whispers. He\u2019s still not sure how he feels about that. </p>\n<p>\u201cNedzu is going to hire a full medical team,\u201d Aizawa-sensei continues. \u201cWhich, quite frankly, we should\u2019ve had years ago. And uh, I guess there\u2019s more All Might needs to tell you about your quirk, so we\u2019re gonna deal with that this weekend. From now on, any time you meet or train with All Might, I have to be there too.\u201d </p>\n<p>Izuku flinches and curls inward, already bracing himself for harsh words. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he whispers. Aizawa-sensei sighs softly. </p>\n<p>\u201cYou have nothing to be sorry for, kid.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cI-I\u2019m, I\u2019ve caused you so much trouble, and now you, you have to do this, waste your time on me, a-and-\u201c</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t <em>have</em> to do anything,\u201d Aizawa-sensei cuts him off. \u201cAnd helping you, teaching you, will never be a waste of time. You are not a burden on us, Izuku. On any of us. We love teaching you, kid.\u201d Izuku can\u2019t comprehend that. It just doesn\u2019t make <em>sense</em>. He lifts his head and looks at Aizawa-sensei, and his protests dry up on his tongue. Aizawa-sensei is smiling at him, and the fond look in his eyes can\u2019t be mistaken for anything else. </p>\n<p>\u201cI know it might take you some time to believe that again,\u201d Aizawa-sensei continues. \u201cAnd that\u2019s okay. We\u2019ll give you all the time you need, kid. One day, I hope I can earn your trust.\u201d Izuku\u2019s vision blurs, but even through his tears he can still see his teacher. The fresh scar under his eye. The gentle smile. The genuine care. The fact that Aizawa-sensei <em>knows</em>, and it hasn\u2019t changed anything. With a burst of courage, Izuku throws his arms around the man\u2019s neck and holds tight to him. Aizawa-sensei\u2019s arms lift to circle around him in return, and Izuku speaks nothing but the truth when he says, </p>\n<p>\u201cYou already have.\u201d</p>\n<p>A background scene from the meeting with Aizawa, Inko, All Might, Nedzu, &amp; Recovery Girl that didn\u2019t make it into the main fic because of the focus I decided to go with. Gives some insight on Recovery Girl\u2019s decision to retire. </p>\n<p>---</p>\n<p>\u201cI have decided to retire,\u201d Shuzenji says calmly, despite the way All Might and Nedzu startle at her words. So she didn\u2019t tell either of them beforehand.</p>\n<p>For a moment, a small vindictive part of Shouta thinks, <em>Good</em>. And then the rest of him realizes that it\u2019s horribly convenient for UA, for Nedzu, if Shuzenji takes full responsibility and the consequences that come with it. He doesn\u2019t mean to activate his quirk, but he feels his hair begin to lift all the same, eyes narrowed in a glare that he fixes on Nedzu. He\u2019s startled into dropping his quirk when Shuzenji reaches across the table and rests her hand on his. </p>\n<p>\u201cShouta,\u201d she chides gently. \u201cLook at me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Shouta sighs and obliges, flicking his gaze away from his boss to Recovery Girl. Something about her smile silences anything he was thinking about saying. </p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m tired,\u201d Shuzenji says bluntly. \u201cI\u2019m tired of watching children break themselves to fix problems they had no hand in causing. It gets worse every year.\u201d Nedzu opens his mouth to speak, but Shuzenji glares sharply and raps her cane on the ground. </p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d she snaps. \u201cI don\u2019t want to talk about the greater good, or what we all do to save others! I spent decades in the field, I am more than aware of what we do, what we sacrifice. But these are children, and I fix them over and over, and so many of them leave here and forget that I\u2019m not out there to heal them. Too many of them <em>die</em>.\u201d </p>\n<p>Shouta feels it seep away now, the rage, the iron claws that have been digging into his lungs ever since he heard Midoriya\u2019s broken voice say those awful words; <em>my fault</em>. It bleeds out of him, a kind of calm taking its place. </p>\n<p>\u201cFor years, it\u2019s just been me,\u201d Shuzenji continues. \u201cHundreds of students toying with their health like it\u2019s <em>nothing</em>, and me. I thought...\u201d She sighs and closes her eyes. \u201cI thought I had it handled. I did. For so many years. But it\u2019s all gone wrong, and I didn\u2019t even notice.\u201d </p>\n<p>Shuzenji opens her eyes and looks between Shouta and Midoriya-san. \u201cIt\u2019s all gone so very wrong,\u201d her mouth trembles. \u201cI didn\u2019t even think about what I was saying to your boy. I didn\u2019t mean it, of course I didn\u2019t, I would never\u2014but I, that I even said it...all I can say is that it\u2019s gone wrong. It shouldn\u2019t have taken this for me to see. I am tired, and I need to be done. I...I am <em>allowed</em> to be done.\u201d At that, she returns her gaze to Nedzu, and Shouta watches as a tremor seems to ruffle through his fur. </p>\n<p>Nedzu bows his head. \u201cOf course, Chiyo,\u201d he replies softly. \u201cI...I miscalculated. I have taken you and your quirk for granted for long enough.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019ll hire a proper medical team now, you hear me?\u201d Shuzenji demands. </p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d Nedzu nods, lifting his head to look at each of them. \u201cYes, of course. I will not make this mistake again.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ll hold you to that,\u201d Midoriya-san warns. Shouta sits up straighter and nods his agreement. </p>\n<p>\u201cI am glad,\u201d Nedzu smiles sadly. \u201cChiyo is right. It has all gone so very wrong, and I will rely on the two of you to help me ensure it goes no further. I do not expect your forgiveness, but I hope I can ask for your help.\u201d </p>\n<p>Shouta looks at Midoriya-san, just for a moment, but he doesn\u2019t really need to. He knows her answer is the same as his. \u201cFor these kids? Always.\u201d </p>\n<p>-----</p>\n<p>A scene that would have been in the fic if I went a route with Nedzu in a more adversarial role. Essentially the route where Nedzu fights back to discourage Shouta and Inko from rocking the boat or suing, for the sake of maintaining UA\u2019s reputation/avoiding more bad PR, because he\u2019s focused on the long term or grand scheme of things. Not meant to portray him as a <em>villain</em>, but rather as the type of character believing that they\u2019re making the right choices to benefit the greater good, even if those choices are morally gray or wrong. </p>\n<p>---</p>\n<p>\u201cI do empathize with your situation,\u201d Nedzu says calmly, his paws folded in front of him on the table. \u201cBut you must understand, there is no proof behind your accusations.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cNo proof?!\u201d Midoriya-san cries. \u201cMy son has been injured multiple times, and I\u2019ve never once been contacted. Recovery Girl performed surgery on him without my permission!\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cSo you say,\u201d Nedzu\u2019s voice remains calm, but Shouta recognizes that glint in his eyes. The worst part is, he knows it\u2019s not malice, even if it looks that way. \u201cBut the evidence does not agree.\u201d Nedzu pushes a tablet across the table, and Shouta doesn\u2019t even need to look. </p>\n<p>Shouta knows what he\u2019ll see. An electronic version of Midoriya\u2019s medical record when there was none before. Midoriya Inko\u2019s signature on paperwork she never saw, maybe even video footage of her visiting the school, or audio of a phone call between her and Recovery Girl, neither of which ever happened. What\u2019s worse, he knows that this is his fault. There\u2019s no doubt in his mind that Nedzu was aware of Izuku\u2019s injury, that he monitored the situation as it unfolded and took action to protect them before it even crossed Shouta\u2019s mind to encourage Midoriya-san to do the same. </p>\n<p>He expects Midoriya-san to deny it, to scream at Nedzu, cry, <em>something</em>. Instead, when Shouta looks at her, there is a calm and calculating look in her eyes. \u201cI see,\u201d she says quietly. \u201cAnd what about his most recent injury?\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cWhat about it?\u201d Nedzu tilts his head, and oh how Shouta <em>hates </em>that tone. </p>\n<p>\u201cMy son broke his wrist in one of your training facilities and hid his injury because he was told he wouldn\u2019t be healed if he injured himself with his quirk,\u201d Midoriya-san replies sharply. \u201cWhile I recognize that I cannot prove he is telling the truth, there is still the issue that my son injured himself on school grounds and <em>no one noticed</em>. That he came to school the following day, attended classes taught by Pro Heroes, and no one noticed his injury for hours. He was training unattended while injured, and not a single Hero on this campus realized he was hurt until he revealed it to Aizawa-san.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cAnd the issue that you, his mother, did not notice?\u201d Nedzu taps his paws lightly on the table. </p>\n<p>\u201cI worked a late shift,\u201d Midoriya-san answers easily. \u201cWhich can be confirmed by my employer.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cI see,\u201d Nedzu nods. \u201cAnd you can prove that Izuku came to school injured because he was not healed until Aizawa-san took him to the hospital.\u201d </p>\n<p>Shouta feels a prickling along his skin, a sense of unease caused by Nedzu\u2019s casual agreement. Midoriya-san clearly feels the same way, judging by the look she gives Nedzu. Part of him wants to interject, but he\u2019s not afraid to admit that Midoriya-san is holding her own against Nedzu with much better success than he would. Nedzu knows him too well. </p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d she answers cautiously. </p>\n<p>\u201cWhile it is troubling that Izuku was not treated sooner,\u201d Nedzu begins. \u201cIt is to be expected that his injury went unnoticed. The Sports Festival was merely a few days ago, and given your son\u2019s behavior with his quirk, it is perfectly reasonable for the staff to have thought any discomfort he showed was due to lingering pain from that experience. Midoriya-san, I believe you work as a secretary for a small law firm in Musutafu, correct?\u201d Nedzu pauses only long enough for Midoriya-san to nod. \u201cThen I\u2019m sure you are aware that most reasonable people would agree with my assessment.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cAnd what of the fact that he was injured while training in an unattended facility?\u201d Midoriya-san points out. Shouta can hear it in her voice. She, like him, already knows that Nedzu has something up his sleeve for this as well. </p>\n<p>\u201cWe have no security footage that confirms he was injured here,\u201d Nedzu confirms their suspicions. \u201cAnd no records indicate his ID being used to access one of the training rooms.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cBecause he was swiped in by an upperclassman,\u201d Shouta grits out. \u201cVideo footage or not, the word of a well ranked student would be taken seriously. I\u2019d like to hear from Aoikaze.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cOf course!\u201d Nedzu smiles, and Shouta feels his stomach sink. </p>\n<p>A moment later, one of Nedzu\u2019s secretaries opens the door, and Nedzu ushers Aoikaze into the room, gesturing for him to sit. The boy bows and greets them, then does as Nedzu asks and sits at the table. </p>\n<p>\u201cThis is the student that Midoriya Izuku described, yes?\u201d Nedzu asks Shouta. </p>\n<p>Shouta doesn\u2019t feel like playing this game. Right now, what he wants more than anything is to take the Midoriya\u2019s to the other side of Japan, bundle them in blankets, and <em>rest</em>. Shouta knows he doesn\u2019t have much choice though, so he grunts quietly and nods. </p>\n<p>\u201cExcellent,\u201d Nedzu chirps. \u201cAoikaze, your ID was used at training facility Eta a few days ago. Midorya-kun has claimed that you let him into your room. Is this true?\u201d </p>\n<p>Even though Shouta knows Midoriya-san has caught onto Nedzu\u2019s game, she still looks at Aoikaze. She\u2019s impressively composed, but Shouta can see the desperation in her eyes. Shouta can\u2019t bring himself to try. Aoikaze is a good kid, a second year who\u2019s taking Aizawa\u2019s underground heroics elective. He\u2019s a damn good kid, but if Nedzu got to Aoikaze, then\u2014</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, that\u2019s true,\u201d Aoikaze answers. Shouta snaps his head up and stares. \u201cI was scheduled to use training room 19 for an hour. Instead, I used my ID to unlock the room and let Midoriya Izuku in. I came back the next hour to use the room. Midoriya-kun was already gone, but I did notice that the first aid kid had been used. I know what\u2019s in each kit. There was an ice pack and a wrist brace missing.\u201d </p>\n<p>For a moment, there is blissful silence as Nedzu stares at Aoikaze, all while Aoikaze meets his eyes without flinching. It\u2019s a rare thing, seeing Nedzu so caught off guard, and Shouta is pretty sure he\u2019s going to treasure this moment for years. </p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m confused, Aoikaze,\u201d Nedzu finally says slowly. \u201cThat is not what you told me this morning.\u201d Translation: that\u2019s not what you agreed you\u2019d say. </p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, here\u2019s the thing,\u201d Aoikaze gestures at Shouta. \u201cI like him more than I\u2019m scared of you.\u201d </p>\n<p>It\u2019s not enough. Shouta knows none of it is enough to actually get <em>anywhere </em>against Nedzu, but that? That\u2019s sure as hell something. As Aoikaze looks away from Nedzu and meets Shouta\u2019s eyes, Shouta can\u2019t help the wide, feral grin that stretches across his face. </p>"
