  "text": "<p>It\u2019s the end of the Sorting Ceremony and Derek isn\u2019t paying attention.</p>\n<p>In fairness to him, no one really pays attention to the last part of the Sorting Ceremony. At least, not fourth years. The second years remain excited because it\u2019s their first time being in charge of clapping loudly and the seventh years take every new member as some sort of personal victory and the people with siblings obviously stay invested but really\u2026 by the end of the alphabet, the vibe is just not the same.</p>\n<p>Derek doesn\u2019t have anything to keep his attention. Cora had predictably joined him and Laura at the Gryffindor table a while ago and now he just wants to eat.</p>\n<p>Still, he manages to keep his eyes pointing in the right direction, just to be polite and so when the last kid goes up (<em>Zelmann, Noah</em>), Derek claps along as he heads to the Hufflepuff table and then turns and-</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd we have one transfer student who will be joining the 4<sup>th</sup>\u00a0years,\u201d Professor McGonagall announces before the chatter can start up in earnest. \u201cMr. Stilinski.\u201d</p>\n<p>She doesn\u2019t offer any other information, even though transfer students are rare. Rare enough that a buzz of questions whips through the room as a boy stands up from the end of the Hufflepuff table and heads towards the stool. Derek isn\u2019t sitting close enough to really see much besides light skin and a mop of brown hair but McGonagall\u2019s face goes a bit pinched when the boy grabs the Sorting Hat almost roughly and plants it on his head.</p>\n<p>\u201cSLYTHERIN!\u201d The Hat shouts the word before even finishing its downward trajectory. Stilinski rips it off, again none too gently, and heads over to the far side of the Great Hall.</p>\n<p>He looks out of place, sitting with the eleven year old kids at the end of the table, but that\u2019s all the thought Derek really gives him. He\u2019s a Slytherin. He\u2019ll land on his feet.</p>\n<p>Besides, one school song and then there will be food.</p>\n<p>*^*^*^</p>\n<p>Derek is not really part of the school\u2019s gossip chain. He\u2019s popular enough, being a from the well-known Hale family and playing as first-string Keeper on the Quidditch team, but generally he doesn\u2019t hang out with too many people. He has Isaac, Boyd, and Erica and that\u2019s pretty much it. And that\u2019s only because the first day of Potions, Isaac sat next to him and they\u2019ve been partners ever since, Boyd is the other 4<sup>th</sup>\u00a0year on the Quidittch team (he plays Beater) and Erica simply showed up in his compartment on the train to Hogwarts and decided she was sticking around. At least when she feels like it.</p>\n<p>And he\u2019s fairly unashamed of the hours he spends alone, studying. He likes the peace and quiet and he likes most of his subjects.</p>\n<p>But, that doesn\u2019t mean Derek isn\u2019t aware of the Hogwarts gossip.</p>\n<p>Because\u00a0<em>he</em>\u00a0might not be socially connected, but his sisters are. With Laura a prefect and all but a shoe-in for Head Girl next year, she seems to make it her personal mission to know everything about everyone. And though Cora arrived<em>literally</em>\u00a0a week ago, she already seems to be more in touch than Derek could ever hope of being.</p>\n<p>In essence, their weekly Saturday Hale-Only breakfast means that Derek is alarmingly current on all the latest news. He knows that the 7<sup>th</sup>\u00a0Year Hufflepuff Power Couple, Maggie and Alec, broke up over the summer. He knows that the word is Timothy Reeves from Ravenclaw apparently accepted an invitation to be an Auror after graduation. He is well aware that Gregory (who is just a year about him in Gryffindor) and Polly (a 6<sup>th</sup>\u00a0year Hufflepuff) spent the entire summer sneaking back and forth to each other\u2019s houses. (Both his sisters agree it\u2019s romantic.)</p>\n<p>Of course, the transfer kid gets mentioned because transfers are rare, but the news isn\u2019t that exciting. In fact, according to Laura, no one even seems to know his first name. The only thing anyone has really figured out about him is that he\u2019s American. And that\u2019s not exactly hard because he obviously has an accent.</p>\n<p>Other than that, even Laura seems stumped. The only news she has from the other prefects is that he\u2019s already getting into trouble in some classes and a few of the teachers seem to dislike him (<em>That\u2019s probably cause he\u2019s a Slytherin</em>, Cora says. Laura tells her not to be ridiculous. Though that\u2019s after nodding slightly.)</p>\n<p>Derek can only shrug when they look over at him. Sure, he has Potions, Astronomy, and Care of Magical Creatures with the kid, but it\u2019s been a week. That\u2019s only a total of six hours spent together. And it\u2019s not like Derek talks to him at all. He stays on his side of the classroom and Stilinski stays on his.</p>\n<p>The only thing Derek really knows is that, despite other reports, he seems quiet enough, prefers to work alone, and has the most amazing shade of amber eyes that Derek has ever seen.</p>\n<p>Not that he\u2019s looking.</p>\n<p>*^*^*^</p>\n<p>Three weeks later, he knows one more thing about Whatever-His-First-Name-Is Stilinski.</p>\n<p>He is absolutely\u00a0<em>awful</em>\u00a0at Potions.</p>\n<p>Usually, as Head of Slytherin, Slughorn seems to relish in giving Slytherins points for anything, praise for doing the bare minimum, and providing extra tips and tricks when required.</p>\n<p>However, with Stilinski, it is clear that not even Slughorn can help him.</p>\n<p>In almost every single class now, Stilinski\u2019s potions have ended up entirely and completely wrong. The smell is often overpowering. Explosions are no longer rare. Even Slughorn is fed up. Snapping at Stilinski just leads to sarcastic responses that result in Slughorn having to take points from his own house.</p>\n<p>\u201cHALE!\u201d Slughorn yells into the relative silence halfway through their lecture. \u201cGo help Stilinski. He\u2019s useless.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek twists to look towards the back of the room. The transfer\u2019s cauldron is smoking. The heat shouldn\u2019t even be on yet. Stilinski has gone red but doesn\u2019t seem to be in the mood to argue with Slughorn today. Maybe he realizes there\u2019s really nothing to argue about. He is pretty useless at Potions.</p>\n<p>\u201cBut-\u201d he starts. Isaac has always been his partner. And he\u2019s a Gryffindor.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Go!</em>\u201d Slughorn growls and Derek sighs but moves. He knows he\u2019s been picked so none of the other Slytherins have to waste time. As he crosses the line, there is definite snickering from the Slytherin side. And maybe a few giggles from the Gryffindors.</p>\n<p>He tries to keep his face fairly neutral, because honestly, Stilinski gets yelled at almost every class and that has to be rough, especially as a transfer student but as he gets closer, he fails. His face falls into a scowl of part disgust and part disbelief because,\u00a0<em>good lord</em>, what the hell has the kid been doing?</p>\n<p>\u201cSorry, man,\u201d Stilinski says as he sits down. He manages to sound both somewhat sincere and incredibly annoyed. His leg is jumping up and down as if he can\u2019t help it. It\u2019s shaking the table. It\u2019s annoying. \u201cI was fucking shit at<em>regular</em>\u00a0Chemistry and this shit is just\u2026 dragon blood, dude, seriously? I mean, fuck, I didn\u2019t even know dragons\u00a0<em>existed</em>\u00a0and now I\u2019m supposed to just dump their blood places.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek blinks. Apparently the rumors that Stilinski curses like a sailor are true. And his American accent sounds ridiculous. It takes a moment for Derek to actually process what he\u2019s even said because he\u2019s talking to fast and his vowels are doing strange things and by that time Stilinski is looking down and-</p>\n<p>\u201cWait,\u201d he says. \u201cYou\u2019re Muggle-born?\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek didn\u2019t even know that was possible. For a Muggle-born Wizard to be put into Slytherin. Well, no, thinking about it, obviously that would have to be<em>possible</em>, it was just-</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Stilinski replies, raising an eyebrow. \u201cI thought that would be obvious.\u201d He gestures to his ruined pile of ingredients.</p>\n<p>And then the rest of it clicks into place.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhere did you transfer from?\u201d Derek asks slowly.</p>\n<p>\u201cUh, Beacon Hills High?\u201d Stilinski replies. \u201cI mean, it\u2019s a public school in California, so I don\u2019t think you would have heard of it-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou mean you didn\u2019t even transfer from a\u00a0<em>magic</em>\u00a0school?\u201d Derek says, slightly aghast. No wonder Stilinski is a bloody disaster at Potions. It\u2019s a surprise he hasn\u2019t killed himself! \u201cHow are you a 4<sup>th</sup>\u00a0year? Shouldn\u2019t you be with the first years?\u201d</p>\n<p>He should be a first year. Okay, yes, he\u2019d be a little old but-</p>\n<p>\u201cI can do all the rest of it,\u201d Stilinski says, voice going a bit hard. \u201cAnd I\u00a0<em>can</em>\u00a0do this, I just- fuck, just forget it, alright. It\u2019s fine. I got it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHey, wait, no,\u201d Derek says, feeling bad as Stiles degrades into mumbled curses. Slytherins and their pride. \u201cSorry, I didn\u2019t mean- I just meant that that explains a lot. About why you need some help.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stilinski, to his credit, looks a bit contrite for immediately jumping to the wrong conclusion and Derek forgives him without thinking about it.</p>\n<p>\u201cDerek,\u201d he says impulsively, even though Gryffindors and Slytherins usually stick to their last names.</p>\n<p>\u201cStiles,\u201d Stilinski replies. At Derek\u2019s raised eyebrow, he shakes his head. \u201cMy real first name is a mess. Not even you guys could pronounce it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAlright,\u201d Derek says, smiling a little bit. \u201cWell, first, you have to cut that lengthwise, and wait, is that your eye of Newt?\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles never stops restlessly moving but Derek find he doesn\u2019t mind as much as he thought he would.</p>\n<p>*^*^*^</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He gets Stiles through that potion and then at the start of the next class, he hovers for just a moment before sitting down next to Isaac.</p>\n<p>The entire class, he keeps expecting to be banished to the Slytherin side once more but Stiles must be studying because he manages to make it through the class without blowing anything up.</p>\n<p>He makes it through the next one too.</p>\n<p>Derek tells himself he\u2019s not disappointed.</p>\n<p>*^*^*^</p>\n<p>The first time he sees Stiles on his own, it\u2019s a Thursday a week later, he\u2019s running to see Professor McGonagall about making sure his broom was officially cleared for flying and there\u2019s a string of muttered cursing coming from a corridor a few minutes from her classroom.</p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t even really think about it, he just turns towards the noise and finds Stiles.</p>\n<p>His books are scattered across the ground and at first Derek thinks it\u2019s just an accident, but then as he moves forward, Stiles sort of flinches back from the sound, eyes wide and wary before landing on Derek.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d he says, his voice going carefully casual. \u201cHey, Derek.\u201d</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a cut along his left cheekbone. It\u2019s bleeding.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Derek says, rushing forward more quickly now.</p>\n<p>\u201cNothing much,\u201d Stiles says, turning away to reach for a book. \u201cYou know, the usual.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Derek says stupidly. He has no idea what Stiles is talking about. What usual?</p>\n<p>Stiles glances back up at him and catches the confusion in his face. His face twists into a smile.</p>\n<p>\u201cRight,\u201d he mutters, more to himself than to Derek. \u201cYou\u2019re a Gryffindor. You guys don\u2019t get beat up. Probably too strong and brave, right?\u201d</p>\n<p>He\u2019s still grabbing his books and supplies and so Derek does the only thing he can think of and bends down to help. He doesn\u2019t know what to say. Because, yes, he knows that fights\u00a0<em>happen</em>\u00a0at Hogwarts, he\u2019s just never really seen one or been a part of one and the one time Evan Wallace, a Hufflepuff, had tried to start something with him, Professor Longbottom had seen and Wallace was stuck in detention for four nights in a row.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou really don\u2019t have to,\u201d Stiles says as Derek starts making his own stack. \u201cIt\u2019s fine. I got it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a problem,\u201d Derek says, frowning in Stiles\u2019 general direction. \u201cReally.\u201d</p>\n<p>He should say more, but he still doesn\u2019t know exactly what to say, so for a moment, they work in silence. Derek grabs a pile of notes and tries to organize them but quickly gives up. He can barely make out a few words on each page.</p>\n<p>\u201cUh,\u201d he says, holding them out and feeling bad. \u201cSorry, I can\u2019t-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d Stiles says, glancing over. \u201cNo, yeah, I\u2019ve got the worst handwriting. ADD and all and these non-lined scrolls don\u2019t really help. Seriously, you guys should have lines. Like for the good of humanity. And spiral notebooks. Nothing is wrong with regular paper, you know? I mean- uh. Just stick \u2018em in a pile and I\u2019ll organize them later.\u201d</p>\n<p>When Derek looks over, Stiles\u2019 face is tinted red and he is chewing on his bottom lip as if to physically stop himself from talking.</p>\n<p>Derek wants to tell him not to bother. He hadn\u2019t really understood a word Stiles had said \u2013it must be an American thing. Or a Muggle thing. Or maybe just a Stiles thing, but he hadn\u2019t minded listening.</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Derek says, because he doesn\u2019t know how to say any of that. They fall back into silence.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey,\u201d Stiles says suddenly, not looking up from reaching for another book. He makes a face at the torn cover before continuing. \u201cWhat\u2019s a mudblood?\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek freezes. He\u2019s never even\u00a0<em>said</em>\u00a0that word. His mother would literally kill him. No one says that word anymore. It\u2019s dirty and vile and-</p>\n<p>\u201cI mean, I know it\u2019s an insult,\u201d Stiles continues when Derek doesn\u2019t answer. \u201cI just like to know what exactly I\u2019m being insulted about this time, you know?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt, uh,\u201d Derek starts. He doesn\u2019t know why explaining it still feels so wrong. It doesn\u2019t actually mean\u00a0<em>anything</em>. \u201cIt a nasty word for when someone is Muggle-born.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d Stiles replies, nodding and looking somewhat satisfied with the information. He doesn\u2019t seem insulted. Probably because he doesn\u2019t understand the full meaning behind the word and Derek doesn\u2019t want to tell him but he can feel his blood start to boil. \u201cGotcha. Real original.\u201d</p>\n<p>It only gets worse when Stiles straightens with a flinch and small gasp of pain and Derek watches as he swipes a hand across his cheekbone to try to clean up the blood.</p>\n<p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe your own\u00a0<em>House</em>\u00a0would do this to you,\u201d Derek growls, standing as well and holding out the books for Stiles to grab. Seriously. Everyone knows Slytherins are the worst, but they usually at least are semi-decent to their own members.</p>\n<p>Stiles laughs. It\u2019s not a particularly pleasant sound.</p>\n<p>\u201cDude, you think\u00a0<em>Slytherins</em>\u00a0did this to me?\u201d He asks, raising an eyebrow and stacking his books in a precarious pile in his arms. \u201cPretty sure your Gryff prejudice is showing.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut-\u201d Derek sputters. Everyone knows that Slytherins are the ones who still care about things like bloodlines and-</p>\n<p>\u201cNope,\u201d Stiles says, rolling his eyes. \u201cThis was all Ravenclaw. They\u2019re a little miffed I\u2019m kicking their asses in Transfiguration.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek stares. That doesn\u2019t make any sense. Ravenclaws don\u2019t pull this sort of thing. Well, a few of them are prats but he still didn\u2019t think they would do\u00a0<em>this</em>.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, thank you ever so much for your help,\u201d Stiles says, interrupting his train of thought and dipping his head in an exaggerated nod. \u201cYou have truly lived up to your Good Guy Gryffindor Role. All is right with the universe.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek scowls at him. Stiles gives him a cheeky grin.</p>\n<p>\u201cLook, we should really report this,\u201d Derek says, as Stiles turns to leave. \u201cI mean, I can tell McGona-\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles snorts.</p>\n<p>\u201cPlease,\u201d he says, his voice losing some of its playfulness. \u201cTeachers don\u2019t do shit about this kind of thing.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek opens his mouth to tell him that this isn\u2019t America, that in Hogwarts, teachers most certainly\u00a0<em>do</em>\u00a0handle this sort of thing, especially if improper use of magic is involved, but Stiles is suddenly smirking at him.</p>\n<p>\u201cSeriously, don\u2019t worry about it,\u201d he tells Derek and his eyes have gone cold and his voice oddly confident and Derek is suddenly very, very aware that Stiles is a\u00a0<em>Slytherin</em>. \u201cThey\u2019ll regret it.\u201d</p>\n<p>*^*^*^</p>\n<p>The next day, word spreads that an extremely potent Itching Hex had been placed on the couches of the Ravenclaw Common Room and that no less than<em>seven</em>\u00a0students had to be admitted to Madam Pomfrey\u2019s for severe rashes. Of course, it could only be a Ravenclaw because only they could get into their own Common Room but no one is ever punished.</p>\n<p>*^*^*^</p>\n<p>Derek does most of his studying in the Gryffindor Common Room, because he, Boyd and Isaac have basically carved out a table in the corner and not many people bother them. Except for Erica. But Derek\u2019s gotten pretty used to tuning things out.</p>\n<p>But, the Charms Exam tomorrow is supposed to be a tough one and Isaac is freaking out and even Erica is attempting to study, which means she\u2019s mumbling loudly to herself and so Derek heads to the library. He needs silence. Or at least something close to it.</p>\n<p>That may be hard to find though, because apparently, Flitwick schedules all his exams for the same day. The library is packed with people and it seems all of them are flicking their wrists and scribbling notes and Derek scowls as he pushes deeper and deeper into the stacks.</p>\n<p>And there, sitting alone in a back crook of the library, is Stiles.</p>\n<p>Doubtlessly, there are open tables if he keeps going because, well, it\u2019s Hogwarts and Derek has never heard of someone being literally unable to find the exact study space they wanted but-</p>\n<p>But he finds himself walking over and hovering until Stiles looks up. There are dark smudges under his eyes and his hair is sticking up in a thousand directions and he still somehow looks adorable.</p>\n<p>Derek shakes himself. That\u2019s not what he-</p>\n<p>\u201cHi,\u201d Derek says abruptly, realizing he\u2019s been staring. \u201cDo you mind?\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles looks up, squinting one eye in confusion. He appears to be so tired that his leg isn\u2019t even jerking up and down under the table.</p>\n<p>Derek blinks, not sure why he remembers that fact from one shared Potions table two weeks ago.</p>\n<p>\u201cUm, uh, no,\u201d Stiles says shaking his head and waving a hand at the other side of the table. \u201cGo for it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek puts his stuff down and Stiles throws him a half-smile before turning back to his book.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo, you studying for the exam tomorrow?\u201d he asks. Just to be friendly. Just because Stiles is a Slytherin doesn\u2019t mean he should be rude. Plus Stiles looks exhausted enough to fall asleep in his book. Derek is just being a good person and keeping him awake.</p>\n<p>\u201cExam?\u201d Stiles sounds alarmed. \u201cWhat exam? For what class?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCharms,\u201d Derek says, concerned. This is worth something crazy like 20% of your grade. If Stiles\u2019 performance with Potions is anything to go by-</p>\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d Stiles says, his entire body sagging in relief. \u201cOh, thank god. Yeah, no, that one. I got that one.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou already studied?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNah, Charms is easy,\u201d Stiles replies. \u201cThat\u2019s no problem.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek frowns. For most people, Charms is one of the hardest subjects. And it\u2019s the most important. Maybe Stiles doesn\u2019t know how the Hogwarts grading system works\u2026</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s just on size manipulation, right?\u201d Stiles says. \u201cOr is it heat transference too?\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek blinks. \u201cNo, no, that\u2019s the next unit I think,\u201d he says.</p>\n<p>\u201cGotcha,\u201d Stiles replies. He seems unconcerned with the answer.</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you already know heat transference?\u201d Derek asks. That doesn\u2019t make any sense either.</p>\n<p>\u201cDude,\u201d Stiles says, yawning and then covering it. \u201cHeat transference is the reason I\u2019m stuck here.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek doesn\u2019t bother saying \u2018what\u2019 out loud but his eyebrows draw into a thin line and Stiles must read the question in them. He looks up and snaps and-</p>\n<p>There is a flame of fire above his fingers.</p>\n<p>He snaps again and it\u2019s gone.</p>\n<p>Derek stares.</p>\n<p>That is\u2026 that should be\u00a0<em>impossible</em>. Wandless magic is\u00a0<em>insanely</em>\u00a0difficult and Stiles had admitted that he just started learning magic a little over a\u00a0<em>month</em>\u00a0ago and\u2026 what?</p>\n<p>\u201cYou can\u2026\u201d He stops. Doesn\u2019t quite know what to say. \u201cYou can control\u00a0<em>fire</em>?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Stiles grumbles and Derek watches as his face falls. \u201cI mean, I sort of can now but that\u2019s why I had to come here. I\u2019ve always been able to do little tricks with stuff but then I started losing control and you let one little fireball loose in Chemistry class and suddenly there\u2019s an owl at your door and you\u2019re being shipped off to boarding school.\u201d</p>\n<p>His voice has gone low and\u00a0<em>sad</em>\u00a0during his speech and his grip around his quill has tightened and-</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s amazing,\u201d Derek says, partly because he\u2019s honestly impressed and partly because he doesn\u2019t quite understand Stiles\u2019 shift in tone.</p>\n<p>\u201cSure,\u201d Stiles\u2019 face flicks into a smile that doesn\u2019t reach his eyes.</p>\n<p>\u201cWandless magic is\u00a0<em>rare</em>, Stiles,\u201d Derek says. Stiles hadn\u2019t even had to say<em>words</em>\u00a0to create that flame. In fact, he\u2019s never heard of someone who can do magic without a wand when they were only fifteen. And exactly how many tricks does Stiles know how to do? Derek\u2019s mom can only do a few and-</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, yeah,\u201d Stiles mutters. \u201cWandless magic is a gift. It\u2019s special. I should be grateful to be here.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek freezes and frowns. It sounds like\u2026</p>\n<p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t want to come here?\u201d It doesn\u2019t make sense. Most Muggles are fascinated by the Wizarding World. Isaac knew more about Hogwarts than even Derek did and was still constantly asking questions and had already declared that he would be a teacher here one day and, yes, Derek knows it is also in part because Hogwarts had saved Isaac from a life with his father but\u2026</p>\n<p>But still. It\u2019s magic. That Stiles can do without even a wand. He should be-</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course not,\u201d Stiles says, rubbing one hand across his face. He says it like it\u2019s obvious. \u201cBut I also don\u2019t want to fail Potions, so\u2026\u201d He lifts his book slightly and Derek takes the hint. Time for silence.</p>\n<p>He still doesn\u2019t get much studying done.</p>\n<p>*^*^*^</p>\n<p>The next time Derek sees Stiles, he hears him long before he sees him.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s walking up to the Owlery, having been given the job of actually mailing their sort-of-weekly letters home by his sisters. He doesn\u2019t mind doing it. He usually heads up once a week to visit Twinkles anyway. (He would love to say that Cora named the family owl, but really, it had been him and no matter how many times he tries to explain that her name just\u00a0<em>was</em>\u00a0Twinkles, everyone laughs at him.)</p>\n<p>It\u2019s a peaceful Saturday afternoon, cool without being actually cold and Derek is enjoying his hike up to the highest point of Hogwarts when-</p>\n<p>\u201cFuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. You fucking piece of shit. Fuck.\u201d</p>\n<p>The voice sounds half-angry, half-desperate and it probably shouldn\u2019t be so easy for Derek to pick out exactly who it is before he even sees him.</p>\n<p>But then again, Stiles is the only American currently enrolled in Hogwarts so maybe Derek can\u2019t be considered a total stalker.</p>\n<p>He takes the turn up the last flight of stairs slowly, a part of him fully expecting to see Stiles, lying on the ground, injured somehow.</p>\n<p>(Derek had only found him like that once, but it still seemed a valid fear. Stiles\u2019 sarcasm is quickly becoming somewhat legendary.)</p>\n<p>But, when he turns, the litany of curses is still somehow coming from above him and he cranes his neck upward to see that Stiles is stretched out on the roof.</p>\n<p>The roof of the\u00a0<em>Owlery</em>. The highest point of Hogwarts. Where there are\u00a0<em>holes</em>for the owls to fly\u00a0<em>in and out of</em>. This is where Stiles has decided to spend his time, staring at a small black device and stabbing at it in frustration.</p>\n<p>\u201cStiles?\u201d he calls. And then flinches because Stiles\u00a0<em>leaps</em>\u00a0in surprise and almost falls into one of the aforementioned holes (which would at least be better than falling\u00a0<em>off the roof</em>) but-</p>\n<p>\u201cShit on my-\u201d Stiles gasps. Then, \u201cI\u2019m getting down, don\u2019t worry.\u201d</p>\n<p>A moment later, Stiles is dangling over the edge of the roof and dropping down. He looks\u2026 defeated, giving Derek nothing more than a slight nod in recognition as he keeps staring at the black thing in his hand.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat were you\u00a0<em>doing</em>\u00a0up there?\u201d Derek asks. \u201cThat can\u2019t be allowed.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Gryff,\u201d Stiles says, rolling his eyes. \u201cI\u2019m not going to make a habit of it. Just trying something.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTrying\u00a0<em>what</em>?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTrying to get some freaking cell service,\u201d Stiles admits, holding up the black thing. \u201cI dunno, I just figured if I could get high enough then maybe\u2026\u201d he cuts off, scowling.</p>\n<p>\u201cElectronics don\u2019t work in Hogwarts,\u201d Derek offers, shrugging.</p>\n<p>Stiles glares at him.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he says, throwing Derek an exaggerated thumbs-up. \u201cThank you. I got that.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek frowns. For all he\u2019s heard of Stiles\u2019 sarcasm, it\u2019s never been directed at him before. He doesn\u2019t like it.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhatever,\u201d Stiles mutters. \u201cI just- I\u2019m just trying to get word out to my dad. In the real world, communication is so\u00a0<em>easy</em>\u00a0and free and here it just\u2026 it just sucks. Fucking shitty-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you use the School owls?\u201d Derek suggests, cutting him off. His voice comes out a little bit less than friendly. Just because Stiles doesn\u2019t want to be here doesn\u2019t mean he should go around calling\u00a0<em>Hogwarts</em>\u00a0a fucking shitty place. It\u2019s<em>\u00a0Hogwarts</em>. \u201cThey\u2019re free to students and-</p>\n<p>\u201cThey\u2019re retired post owls,\u201d Stiles interrupts, his voice matching Derek\u2019s tone. Clipped and more than a little angry. \u201cNone of them are cleared to fly internationally. And do you have\u00a0<em>any</em>\u00a0idea how much it costs to send an owl to California? In\u00a0<em>dollars</em>? Or even in freaking British pounds? Which you then have to practically double to get it in dollars!\u201d</p>\n<p>Just like that, Derek feels his anger leave him. Because he\u2019s\u2026 he has no idea how much that would cost. He\u2019s never tried to send a package internationally and even if he had to, he\u2019s a Hale. Money is not an issue. And why would he ever need to know the conversion rates?</p>\n<p>\u201cErm\u2026 No. I- I-,\u201d Derek offers, feeling stupid.</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course you don\u2019t,\u201d Stiles snaps. \u201cNo one here knows\u00a0<em>anything</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek opens his mouth to say something, to maybe try to apologize again, but Stiles barrels on. As if he can\u2019t stop now that he\u2019s started.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd it\u2019s not just you, you know\u2026 it\u2019s- it\u2019s this entire fucking\u00a0<em>school</em>. With its fucking ridiculous dress code and stupid classes with weird shit I\u2019m never going to need to know again in my\u00a0<em>life</em>\u00a0and then- then to top it all off, I\u2019m sorted into some weird team thing that seems to make everyone hate me or some shit. Fuck, I didn\u2019t even get a\u00a0<em>say</em>\u00a0in it!\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles has picked up speed now, waving his arms around enough that \u00a0Derek is concerned the device is going to just fly out of his hand. But it\u2019s not that that makes Derek flinch. It\u2019s because his family has always been strict on the rhetoric of kindness to all Houses but he has to admit that sometimes he slips. Sometimes they all slip.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd, yeah, the people in my House hate me but that\u2019s because I lose us like\u2026 a fucking billion points a day and no one else seems to realize that the House Cup is literally just some wack system that has no bearing on real life, but at least they hate me for a\u00a0<em>reason</em>. Everyone else just hates me for being a Slytherin. Or a mudblood. Or because I can transform a rat into a teacup without a wand. Which, for the record,\u00a0<em>I don\u2019t even want to be able to do!</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles stops to take a breath and Derek is horrified to hear that it hitches and suddenly Stiles doesn\u2019t sound angry but sad and maybe hopeless and-</p>\n<p>\u201cSo now I\u2019m stuck here. And I just want to talk to my dad. Or S-Scott,\u201d he stops, mouth twisting, for a heartbeat. \u201cA-and I can\u2019t even do that because the stupid, fucking magic means that there\u2019s no\u2026 fucking electricity. Or-or internet. Or-\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles stops and heaves in a breath and his eyes are filled with tears and then seems to realize that Derek is still standing there. Because he looks upwards and blinks furiously and sucks in another shuddering breath and forces himself to hold it and he turns away from a moment, running a hand across his eyes and-</p>\n<p>\u201cSorry,\u201d he says, angling towards Derek but not quite looking at him. He pulls his face into a smile that looks more like a grimace of pain. \u201cSorry about\u2026 about that. You can go. It\u2019s just\u2026 I\u2019m just having a bad day. It\u2019s fine. Just, uh, I\u2019ll see you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWait,\u201d Derek says, because there\u2019s no way he can just let Stiles leave like this. Not when he is still sniffling and his face is still red and he still looks somehow<em>smaller</em>\u00a0than Derek has ever seen him. \u201cWait, here, stop. Use my family\u2019s owl.\u201d</p>\n<p>Hurriedly, he sticks up an arm and in a moment Twinkles is there. He basically shoves her in Stiles\u2019 face. He\u2019d do pretty much anything to get Stiles to stop almost-crying.</p>\n<p>Just the sight of it feels so wrong it\u2019s almost like a physical pain. And\u00a0<em>he</em>\u00a0was the one to suggest something so stupid like\u00a0<em>Use a school owl</em>\u00a0and so this is partly his fault and-</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, that\u2019s, really,\u201d Stiles says, shaking his head. \u201cThat\u2019s okay. I\u2019m fine.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShe\u2019s authorized to fly internationally,\u201d Derek says. \u201cIt will take a week or so, but she can make it to California.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, I can\u2019t,\u201d Stiles replies. \u201cReally, you don\u2019t have to-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPlease,\u201d Derek says. \u201cYou\u2019re right. It\u2019s a shit system. You deserve- your dad will want to hear from you. She can bring a letter back too.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles stops taking steps away. Derek sees the desperation in his eyes before he even says the next words,</p>\n<p>\u201cA-are you sure?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Derek says. \u201cOf course, here, you\u2019re just gonna attach the letter right there and then give her a name. She\u2019ll find them.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI- I still have to write it,\u201d Stiles replies, looking down. \u201cShould I-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHere, I\u2019ve got parchment,\u201d Derek replies. He turns to his bird. \u201cTwinkles, stay with Stiles and then pick up some return paper, in case they don\u2019t have any, and then deliver his message, okay?\u201d</p>\n<p>Twinkles hoots seriously as if she knows this is important. Stiles stills looks a bit overwhelmed. Derek walks over to the small table that\u2019s kept in the corner for writing down addresses and then pulls out the stool. Then he dumps all the paper out of his pocket onto the table and set Twinkles down.</p>\n<p>\u201cThere,\u201d he says satisfied that Stiles can take it from here. \u201cJust, uh,\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you sure this is okay?\u201d Stiles asks even as he moves towards the desk. \u201cI mean, you really don\u2019t-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d Derek interrupts, wondering if it would be weird to conjure up a few tissues. \u201cReally, don\u2019t even worry about it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cO-okay,\u201d Stiles says, his voice small. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo problem,\u201d Derek says. \u201cTake your time.\u201d</p>\n<p>And then, because Stiles is still standing and fidgeting as if he doesn\u2019t quite know what to do with the turn of events, Derek leaves.</p>\n<p>He\u2019ll use the school owls to mail his letters tomorrow.</p>\n<p>*^*^*^</p>\n<p>Derek doesn\u2019t quite know what he expected to happen after such an awkward meeting. It seems like he and Stiles should be closer now that he\u2019s seen Stiles have a sort of mini-meltdown and offered his family owl to fly thousands of miles but he doesn\u2019t want Stiles to think that he\u00a0<em>owes</em>\u00a0Derek anything so he keeps his same routine. Which means not sitting next to Stiles in Potions or any of their other classes and not seeking Stiles out in the library (well, he only tries that twice before giving up).</p>\n<p>A few things change, though.</p>\n<p>They start doing a small awkward wave at the beginning of Potions and Derek keeps telling himself he should go over and say hi but by the time he works up the courage, Stiles is already looking at his book again.</p>\n<p>In Astronomy, most of Derek\u2019s time is spent trying not to fall asleep and subtly copying from Boyd, who is a whiz as Astronomy, but every once and a while he catches himself staring over at Stiles. And Stiles seems to constantly forget that you are supposed to be using the telescope and spends most of the class staring up at the stars without taking notes.</p>\n<p>Derek starts trying to inch whatever animal he\u2019s working with that day closer to Stiles. Or at least the Slytherin side. Because no matter what the creature, Stiles seems to handle them all the same: He gives them a name that makes absolutely no sense, talks at them constantly, and then politely asks them to do random tasks. There is also crooning, baby-talk, and singing involved.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s the happiest Derek ever gets to hear him. It\u2019s possible Derek is addicted to it.</p>\n<p>And he doesn\u2019t exactly\u00a0<em>see\u00a0</em>Stiles any more often than before, but he does find himself glancing over more. Just to make sure he\u2019s okay. And it\u2019s amazing what you can pick up about a person, just by watching them.</p>\n<p>He knows that Stiles always brings a book to breakfast and often gets so engrossed that he seems to forget to eat. He knows that sometimes, Stiles will casually stir his food by waving one hand around his spoon without touching it and doesn\u2019t seem to notice the amazed stares he gets before people become used to this.</p>\n<p>He knows that for some reason Stiles isn\u2019t usually at lunch or dinner.</p>\n<p>So, he only gets breakfast and three precious classes to watch him. And breakfast is the easiest option, so he has to do it now, has to try to focus his eyes from across the room and make sure that no new bruises have appeared or he\u2019s forgetting to eat again and-</p>\n<p>\u201cDerek! Derek!\u201d The tone of Cora\u2019s voice means that she\u2019s definitely tried to get his attention more than once.</p>\n<p>He blinks and then scowls and swipes the hand away from his face.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he growls. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p>\n<p>Saturday morning is probably not the best time to space out while staring across the room at the Slytherin table. Both of his sisters raise matching eyebrows at him.</p>\n<p>Luckily, he has a reputation for ignoring them when they start talking too much about the weird political schemes of Hogwarts students so they don\u2019t push too much.</p>\n<p>\u201cI was\u00a0<em>asking</em>,\u201d Cora says in between bites of waffles. \u201cWhere you sent Twinkles off to. I was going to send a letter to Grandma but when I went up, she wasn\u2019t there.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d Derek says and then hesitates because, well, Twinkles won\u2019t be back for at least another week, maybe more and-</p>\n<p>\u201cDid you forget to send the letters home from last week?\u201d Laura asks, sighing. \u201cThis is why Mom always yells at us for not writing often enough.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m telling Dad to point his disappointed sighs only at you,\u201d Cora grumbles. \u201cI swear, my letter was actually pretty long this time too!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI sent them!\u201d He protests, flicking his eyes to Stiles. \u201cI just lent Twinkles to someone. It\u2019s not a big deal.\u201d</p>\n<p>It\u2019s the wrong thing to say. Telling his sisters that something isn\u2019t a big deal is basically informing them that there is a huge secret they must uncover.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy would you lend Twinkle-toes to someone?\u201d Cora asks. \u201cThere are like a hundred school owls people can use.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThey don\u2019t fly internationally,\u201d Derek says and considers it a win when Laura blinks in surprise.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy would someone need to send something\u00a0<em>internationally</em>?\u201d Cora demands. Derek flushes.</p>\n<p>\u201cBecause they live overseas,\u201d he says, hoping maybe that\u2019s the end of it.</p>\n<p>He should know better. It\u2019s his sisters. That\u2019s never going to be the end of it.</p>\n<p>It takes Laura all of two seconds to put two and two together.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou gave our owl to\u00a0<em>Stilinski</em>?\u201d she says, disbelief clear in her voice. \u201cI heard he yelled at McGonagall for taking points off just because his transformed ashtray was shaped like a\u00a0<em>penis</em>!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd Hannah told me that her brother said he keeps interrupting in History of Magic and demanding to know why wizards don\u2019t intervene in Muggle stuff,\u201d Cora says.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe loses at\u00a0<em>least</em>\u00a0fifty points a day,\u201d Laura says, her voice entirely judgmental. \u201cEven the Slytherin prefects think he should be expelled!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Cora replies. \u201cHe\u2019s a\u00a0<em>Slytherin</em>. He\u2019s a git!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLook,\u201d Derek says, his voice rising in anger. \u201cJust because he\u2019s a Slytherin doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s a bad person and neither of you know\u00a0<em>anything</em>\u00a0about him and he hasn\u2019t gotten to talk to his family since he\u00a0<em>got</em>\u00a0here so, yes, I told him he could use Twinkles. It was the right thing to do so\u00a0<em>back off</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>He\u2019s standing as he speaks, pushing his side of the bench back angrily and he\u2019s glad that Stiles is on the other side of the room and can\u2019t hear him or his sisters. He\u2019s glad that when he looks over, Stiles seems to have fallen asleep, one hand propping up his head, mouth slightly open, and so there\u2019s no way that Stiles can even see him as he ignores his sisters\u2019 shocked faces and storms away.</p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s so mad about. That everyone in the school seems to hate Stiles or that his own sisters are being so close-minded or that, a week ago, he thought pretty much the same way.</p>\n<p>*^*^*^</p>\n<p>Both his sisters eventually offer up apologies, in their own way.</p>\n<p>Cora swings by to his back corner, puts down a pile of three chocolate frogs (his favorite) on his table, loudly claims she got them for him only because he\u2019s fat and she\u2019s the best sister ever and then walks away before he can say anything.</p>\n<p>Laura is a bit more direct. Derek finds her inexplicably outside the door to his Divination class, not so subtly giving two Slytherins ten points each for \u201clooking engaged in learning\u201d before swinging and arm over Derek and walking him down the hall.</p>\n<p>She talks about nothing for a while, asking him questions about the upcoming kick-off Quidditch match and how he plans on beating Ravenclaw and if he is excited for practice to start up. Derek is about to tell her that he gets it, that she can stop trying so hard, when they arrive at her classroom and she slaps him on the shoulder.</p>\n<p>\u201cSorry I was being a jerk before,\u201d she says, meeting his eyes seriously.</p>\n<p>Then, she turns and heads into her classroom without another word.</p>\n<p>Maybe they aren\u2019t the best apologies, but Derek forgives them because they\u2019re his sisters and he loves them and he knows they didn\u2019t really mean anything by it.</p>\n<p>Still, he can\u2019t help but feeling that it shouldn\u2019t be him they are apologizing to.</p>\n<p>*^*^*^</p>\n<p>The only good thing about Stiles being a Slytherin is that Derek is pretty sure if it were any other boy that he had become so oddly protective of, his sisters would be on him and teasing him about his crush in an instant. Not that it was actually a\u00a0<em>crush</em>\u00a0because he doesn\u2019t know Stiles and he\u2019s pretty sure you have to know someone before you can have a crush on them. Still, he\u2019s grateful that the next Family Breakfast passes without issue. The closest they come to discussing Stiles is when Laura asks if Twinkles is back yet.</p>\n<p>Derek tells her he\u2019ll let them know as soon as he knows.</p>\n<p>Turns out, that wouldn\u2019t be necessary.</p>\n<p>On Tuesday morning, the owls rush in with their usual hoots of welcome and Derek is scanning them idly when-</p>\n<p>\u201cHOWLER!\u201d Someone yells from the Hufflepuff table and there\u2019s a small cheer from the room. Howler\u2019s are always fun to watch. Even the teachers sitting at the Head Table look up with varying degrees of disguised interest.</p>\n<p>Derek squints up into the rush of bird and has just spotted the telltale red envelope when he realizes he\u00a0<em>knows</em>\u00a0the owl to which it is attached and for a brief second he thinks that Twinkles must have stopped home to check if they had mail and his mother is annoyed at him for lending her for a transatlantic journey without asking her first. Which sucks. Howlers are always embarrassing.</p>\n<p>But Twinkles is heading to the far side of the Great Hall.</p>\n<p>She\u2019s heading for Stiles.</p>\n<p>And the nervous feeling in his gut sinks into something more dismayed. Because Stiles\u2019 father must not\u00a0<em>know</em>\u00a0that it wasn\u2019t Stiles\u2019 fault that he couldn\u2019t write for almost a month and he must be furious. Worse, Stiles seems completely unaware of the whispers that have broken out and opens reaches for the red letter to open it without even trying to make a run for it and-</p>\n<p>\u201cOH MY GOD OH MY GOD OH MY GOD!! DUUUDE!!!\u201d The American voice that bursts from the red card doesn\u2019t sound angry. It sounds\u2026 well, happy isn\u2019t a strong enough word. It\u2019s more like elated. The Great Hall goes silent anyway. \u201cYOU SENT US A LETTER! A REAL LETTER! WITH AN OWL! WE WERE LIKE FREAKING GOING NUTS NOT HAVING HEARD FROM YOU AND THEN THIS OWL TOTALLY FOUND ME AT\u00a0<em>WORK</em>, DUDE! LIKE IT FLEW IN WHILE I WAS GIVING MR. HARRIS\u2019 CAT A FLEABATH- OH MY GOD, THAT\u2019S RIGHT. HIS CAT HAS THE\u00a0<em>WORST</em>\u00a0CASE OF FLEAS EVER. YOU WOULD LOVE IT.</p>\n<p>\u201cANYWAY, OH MY GOD. I CAN\u2019T BELIEVE THIS. THIS IS THE BEST. I\u2019M WRITING ON THIS RED PIECE OF PAPER BECAUSE I THINK IT MEANS LIKE\u2026 EMERGENCY DELIVERY? I DON\u2019T REALLY KNOW. THE OWL IS POKING AT IT SO I GUESS THAT\u2019S WHAT IT MEANS. CAN YOU TALK TO OWLS YET? OR IS IT STILL ONLY SNAKES? BRO, I TOTALLY HOPE YOU CAN TALK TO OWLS. THIS ONE SEEMS AWESOME. OR DRAGONS! DID I READ THAT RIGHT? DRAGONS ARE REAL?!\u201d</p>\n<p>The voice coming through the Howler is amazed and young somehow and also the most American thing that Derek has ever heard and he doesn\u2019t understand why most people look a little annoyed that Stiles didn\u2019t run for it. Maybe without the juiciness of someone being yelled at, it becomes just a loud breakfast annoyance but Derek thinks it\u2019s\u2026\u00a0<em>wonderful.</em></p>\n<p>\u201cOKAY, FOCUSING, HOME IS GOOD, MAN. TOTALLY GOOD. I MEAN, IT\u2019S NOT\u00a0<em>TOTALLY</em>\u00a0GOOD SINCE YOU\u2019RE NOT HERE AND DUDE, BRO, GEOMETRY IS LITERALLY KICKING MY ASS BUT NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT! WE\u2019VE BEEN FEEDING YOUR DAD PLENTY- NO MEAT, DON\u2019T WORRY - AND I THINK- WAIT, FUCK, I\u2019M RUNNING OUT OF ROOM. I CAN PROBABLY WRITE SMALLER. I THINK YOUR DAD JUST ABOUT HAD A HEART ATTACK WHEN HE GOT YOUR LETTER, THOUGH. DEATON LET ME LEAVE EARLY TO RUN THEM OVER AND HE WAS RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF ARRESTING SOMEONE AND DUDE, THE GUY TOTALLY COULD HAVE ESCAPED RIGHT THEN.</p>\n<p>\u201cFUCK, THIS PAPER IS NOT BIG ENOUGH- BUT, STILES, MY MOM LITERALLY\u00a0<em>BURST</em>\u00a0INTO TEARS. LIKE IT WAS HILARIOUS. WAIT, I GOTTA SWITCH-\u201d</p>\n<p>The Howler cuts off abruptly and then, as usual, bursts into flames. Dimly Derek hears a few people sneer about Muggles not knowing what a Howler is supposed to be used for but his eyes don\u2019t leave Stiles.</p>\n<p>Stiles is staring at the pile of ash on the table and, again, happy isn\u2019t a strong enough word. His hand is clutching the remaining pile of letters and his face is pulled into a smile of part disbelief, part ecstasy, and as Derek watches, he blinks hard and then leans over and taps his forehead against Twinkle\u2019s head gently.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s as Twinkles flies off that he seems to realize he has a bit of an audience. He flushes and then frowns down at the pile of ash, mutters something, smirks a little when the pile of ash is suddenly a red piece of paper again, and leaves the Great Hall.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Derek is resisting every urge in his body that wants to follow him, just so he can catch another glimpse of that smile, when Twinkles suddenly lands on his shoulder, her feathers ruffling to reveal another letter.</p>\n<p>Derek does half rise then, grabbing it and assuming that Stiles has missed one but then he catches sight of the envelope:</p>\n<p>TO THE GUY WHO LENT STILES HIS OWL</p>\n<p>He sinks back down and opens it slowly. It\u2019s a short message, hastily scrawled on a torn piece of thin paper:</p>\n<p>THANK YOU SO MUCH! THAT WAS TOTALLY AWESOME OF YOU! \u2013 SCOTT</p>\n<p>*^*^*^</p>\n<p>\u201cHey.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek jumps as Stiles slides up next to him as he leaves Transfiguration. As usual, he\u2019s the last one out the door because if there\u2019s one teacher truly obsessed with Quidditch, it\u2019s McGonagall and the game against Ravenclaw is only two weeks away. Which means she\u2019s taken to holding him back and \u201ccasually reminding\u201d him of the shooting styles of the three Chasers.</p>\n<p>\u201cBloody- Stiles!\u201d Derek says, heart still hammering. People should not move so silently. Or jump out at people right as they left classrooms. Stiles is supposed to be practically on the other side of the school in Charms class anyway. \u201cStop being such a-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSneaky Slytherin?\u201d Stiles suggests, raising one eyebrow. Derek scowls.</p>\n<p>\u201cI was going to say freaking stalker,\u201d he says.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re the one who keeps showing up wherever I am,\u201d Stiles points out and Derek fights to keep his face from blushing because that is 100% true. \u201cUsually when I\u2019m in some form of distress.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell maybe you should stop being in distress then,\u201d Derek mumbles.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd deny you the chance to save the day?\u201d Stiles asks, grinning. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t dream of it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek scowls, but it\u2019s more so that he doesn\u2019t grin. He can\u2019t remember ever seeing Stiles look so\u2026 balanced. And happy. For once, his banter doesn\u2019t seem to be barbed or ironic or masking some sort of pain.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnyway,\u201d Stiles says, his playful grin sliding from his face. \u201cI just wanted to say thanks for, uh, letting me use your owl. It, well, it was really nice. And Scott works for a vet and he looked her over and said she was fine. And my dad apparently bought her a bunch of mice to eat, so\u2026 um, yeah she should be good.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d Derek says, shaking his head. \u201cOh, he didn\u2019t need to do that. She can totally hunt for herself. But, I mean, that\u2019s really nice of them.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, well, my dad literally dedicated a whole paragraph to telling me about the mice and worrying about whether that was the right thing to do so, I\u2026\u201d Stiles shifts, his right hand fluttering towards his pocket. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSeriously,\u201d Derek says and he has no idea why it was so much easier to talk to Stiles a moment ago. \u201cDon\u2019t-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMr. Stilinski.\u201d</p>\n<p>Professor McGonagall\u2019s voice cuts through their awkward attempts at conversation like a whip. Derek sort of freezes for some reason and Stiles practically flinches away from him and-</p>\n<p>\u201cI need to see you in my classroom, please,\u201d McGonagall finishes.</p>\n<p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t even doing anything!\u201d Stiles protests immediately. \u201cI haven\u2019t done anything all day!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhich seems to imply that you did do something less than honorable<em>yesterday</em>, Mr. Stilinski,\u201d McGonagall says and, as usual, it\u2019s a little hard to tell whether or not she\u2019s joking. Derek suspects she is, but Stiles scowls at her and he vaguely recalls stories about how the two don\u2019t get along and suddenly that\u2019s unacceptable. He loves McGonagall but it seems to him that the entire school is against Stiles for some reason and he has his mouth open to say something when-</p>\n<p>\u201cMy classroom, Mr. Stilinski,\u201d McGonagall says, holding the door open a bit more. \u201cMr. Hale, I suggest you get to class.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles walks in with a defeated slump to his shoulders and Derek turns as if he\u2019s heading to class, but then-</p>\n<p>He turns and casts a small listening spell before he really thinks about it.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>I honestly don\u2019t see how I could have pissed you off,</em>\u201d Stiles is saying. \u201c<em>I don\u2019t even have your class till tomorrow! And I did the reading! I could duplicate that stool six times right now! I even know where my wand is! And I-\u201d</em></p>\n<p>\n<em>\u00a0</em>\n</p>\n<p><em>\u201cMr. Stilinski!\u201d\u00a0</em>McGonagall interrupts.\u00a0<em>\u201cYou are not in trouble.\u201d</em></p>\n<p>\n<em>\u00a0</em>\n</p>\n<p><em>\u201cI- I\u2019m not?\u201d</em>\u00a0Stiles says.\u00a0<em>\u201cBecause I may have lied before\u2026 I actually have no idea where my wand is.\u201d</em></p>\n<p>\n<em>\u00a0</em>\n</p>\n<p>Derek can help it. He snorts a laugh.</p>\n<p><em>\u201cI called you in to apologize,</em>\u201d McGonagall says. And Derek guesses from Stiles\u2019 silence that he\u2019s stunned. \u201c<em>On behalf of the staff. I\u2019m afraid that we were\u2026 unaware of the current issues regarding your ability to communicate with your family and have resolved to fix this immediately.\u201d</em></p>\n<p>\n<em>\u00a0</em>\n</p>\n<p>Another moment of confused silence.</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cWhat?\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p><em>\u201cHere,\u201d</em>\u00a0McGonagall says. \u201c<em>A list of all the faculty who have personal owls cleared to fly internationally. You are free to use any of them at any time. It was\u2026 I cannot tell you how unacceptable it is that this aspect of your learning was overlooked.\u201d</em></p>\n<p>\n<em>\u00a0</em>\n</p>\n<p><em>\u201c\u2026 really?\u201d</em>\u00a0Stiles sounds amazed. Maybe a little suspicious, but more amazed. \u201c<em>Any- any time I want?\u201d</em></p>\n<p>\n<em>\u00a0</em>\n</p>\n<p><em>\u201cYes,\u201d</em>\u00a0McGonagall sounds firm but her voice has softened. \u201c<em>And is there anything else you need as an international student that we are not currently providing?\u201d</em></p>\n<p>\n<em>\u00a0</em>\n</p>\n<p><em>\u201cN-No,\u201d\u00a0</em>Stiles says. He still sounds a bit shaky. \u201c<em>No, that\u2019s it.\u201d</em></p>\n<p>\n<em>\u00a0</em>\n</p>\n<p><em>\u201cWell, I expect you to inform either myself or Professor Slughorn if that changes,\u201d</em>\u00a0McGonagall says, her voice firm but a clear dismissal. \u201c<em>And, you had best go find your wand, Mr. Stilinski. I\u2019ve told you time and time again that just because you\u00a0</em>can<em>\u00a0do magic without it-\u201d</em></p>\n<p>\n<em>\u00a0</em>\n</p>\n<p><em>\u201cDoesn\u2019t mean I should leave it lying around,\u201d</em>\u00a0Stiles finishes and Derek doesn\u2019t need to see him to know that his cocky grin is back.</p>\n<p>McGonagall probably says something back but Derek breaks his charm and then all but flees the scene. He\u2019s in no mood to get stuck with Detention for eavesdropping.</p>\n<p>And he doesn\u2019t need Stiles knowing just how creepy he really is.</p>\n<p>*^*^*^</p>\n<p>He ends up in Detention anyway.</p>\n<p>They\u2019re walking back from Care of Magical Creatures and Jason Collins, a Gryffindor who Derek has never really liked all that much as he seems more than a bit conceited, hangs back, pretending to help clean up and then-</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m thinking of writing my mother later today,\u201d he says, loudly and Derek is already tensing. He\u2019s going for a joke, Derek knows and Jason\u2019s jokes are almost always shit. Especially when he sets himself up like this. And Stiles is the only Slytherin still in earshot. \u201cMaybe I\u2019ll send her a friendly little Howler. Apparently that\u2019s the thing to do these days!\u201d</p>\n<p>To the other Gryffindors\u2019 credit, no one laughs.</p>\n<p>But no one tells him off either.</p>\n<p>Derek feels his temper rising and he\u2019s known as a quiet kid but he opens his mouth to say something when-</p>\n<p>\n<em>Bang!</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u00a0</em>\n</p>\n<p>The books Jason was carrying are suddenly five times larger. He drops them in surprise, yelping a bit, and then it becomes obvious that they are not stopping in their expansion. Instead, they are getting bigger and bigger and Jason is forced to leap backwards and Derek hadn\u2019t noticed it before but the quill he was holding is doing the same thing, now almost the size of a small tree sticking up out of the ground and-</p>\n<p>\u201cFucking hell, Stilinski!\u201d Jason says, spinning to glare at Stiles. Almost everyone else has stopped walking too. \u201cChange them back!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about,\u201d Stiles says, his voice a sarcastic drawl. \u201cI don\u2019t even have my wand out.\u201d He earns himself a few chuckles from the crowd.</p>\n<p>\u201cShut up!\u201d Jason says. \u201cEveryone knows you bloody well don\u2019t need it. Now fix it!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSorry,\u201d Stiles says, sounding anything but. He has to talk a full five steps to the right to get around the still-growing school supplies. \u201cCan\u2019t help you.\u201d More than a few people giggle this time.</p>\n<p>That\u2019s what does it.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou fucking-!\u201d Jason snarls. \u201cJust because your fucking idiot of a friend is too bloody stupid-\u201d</p>\n<p>Maybe everyone else is watching the books, or even watching Jason as his face goes red in rage, but Derek is watching Stiles.</p>\n<p>So he sees when the insult to Scott lands and Stiles\u2019 eyes suddenly lose all of their playfulness and his mouth twists, but behind all that anger there is a flash \u2013 just a flash \u2013 of\u00a0<em>hurt</em>\u00a0and how\u00a0<em>dare</em>\u00a0Jason ruin this day for him and-</p>\n<p>Derek lunges forward and punches Jason across the mouth before he really thinks about it. Before Stiles can do something to get himself expelled.</p>\n<p>Jason goes down easily and there\u2019s a gasp from the crowd and a few people to step forward to stop him but Derek is already stepping away, breathing hard, and it\u2019s no surprise when Professor Kettleburn is suddenly\u00a0<em>there</em>.</p>\n<p>(At this point, the books are almost twenty feet across. They aren\u2019t exactly hard to miss.)</p>\n<p>\u201cMr. Hale!\u201d Kettleburn snaps. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d With a wave of his wand, the books return to their natural size. Jason is still on the ground next to him.</p>\n<p>\u201cNothing,\u201d Derek grunts, still glaring at Jason.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat did not look like\u00a0<em>nothing</em>,\u201d Kettleburn says. \u201cFollow me. We\u2019re going to see Professor McGonagall\u00a0<em>immediately</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek doesn\u2019t argue. Can\u2019t really. Jason is still pouting on the ground and Derek\u2019s hand is stinging (and maybe bleeding) and he\u2019s still having difficulty hearing over the rush of blood in his ears and when Kettleburn starts walking, Derek goes to follow.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s a fucking\u00a0<em>Slytherin</em>,\u201d Jason says furiously at his back.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, well, you\u2019re a fucking piece of shite,\u201d Derek calls over his shoulder. He only manages to catch a few of the stunned looks from his classmates, before flicking his eyes over to Stiles.</p>\n<p>Even when he\u2019s stuck cleaning the dungeons for three hours that night, Stiles\u2019 look of complete shock is worth it.</p>\n<p>*^*^*^</p>\n<p>Derek doesn\u2019t hesitate this time. He walks into Potions class, throws Isaac a nod that he hopes conveys some sort of apology, and throws his stuff down next to Stiles.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a burst of mutters throughout the classroom, from both sides, but Derek purposefully timed this so that there wouldn\u2019t be much time for conversation or complaint.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat are you-\u201d Stiles doesn\u2019t even get a chance to finish the question before Slughorn sweeps into the room and starts going over the procedure for today\u2019s potion.</p>\n<p>Which works out. Because Derek doesn\u2019t really have an answer.</p>\n<p>Well, he knows the basics: he\u2019s sitting with Stiles. But beyond that, he has nothing. He\u2019s sitting with Stiles because he wants to and because Stiles needs someone and because, honestly, fuck Gryffindors right now and if the Slytherins say anything, fuck them too.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s still oddly angry too. Punching Jason didn\u2019t calm him down as much as it should have. He\u2019s annoyed that he\u2019s become the center of gossip, that when he returned from his detention, it was only to have the Common Room break out in whispers. He hadn\u2019t stuck around to hear what those whispers were<em>saying</em>, had swung up to the bedroom and drawn the curtains around his bed in a clear\u00a0<em>Don\u2019t talk to me</em>\u00a0message.</p>\n<p>And he\u2019s avoided his sisters so far, but he knows that Saturday morning is going to be a string of questions and complaints and Laura\u2019s going to worry that he\u2019s ruined her chances at Head Girl and, really, when did Hogwarts get so bloody\u00a0<em>annoying</em>?</p>\n<p>He keep his eyes firmly on Slughorn and the chalkboard and then when Slughorn releases them to try making the potion, he keeps them firmly on his desk.</p>\n<p>At first, he and Stiles work in a sort of tense silence though everyone else has started chatting. Derek doesn\u2019t doubt at least some of it is about them.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou shoudn\u2019t have done that,\u201d Stiles mutters finally. He sounds annoyed. Derek finally risks looking over to find that, unlike him, Stiles is glancing around the room rapidly, as if to catalogue everyone\u2019s reactions.</p>\n<p>\u201cDone what?\u201d Derek grunts, looking back towards his bat spleen. Stiles snorts. Derek can practically\u00a0<em>hear</em>\u00a0his eye roll.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou know what.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCollins deserved it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNot that,\u201d Stiles says and Derek looks up to see that he\u2019s\u00a0<em>still</em>\u00a0glaring around the room. \u201cEnough people saw him being a dick. You could have gotten away with that. But this-\u201d he waves a hand between them. \u201cSitting with me\u2026 it\u2019s going to cause problems.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek blinks. He didn\u2019t even think about his actions making Stiles\u2019 life even<em>more</em>\u00a0difficult. He has his mouth open to apologize when Stiles sighs.</p>\n<p>\u201cLook, Collins is already muttering to Lovatt,\u201d Stiles says. \u201cAnd everyone knows Lovatt\u2019s older brother is best friends with Bedi.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Derek asks, eyebrow climbing to the top of his head. That was-</p>\n<p>\u201cAarav Bedi,\u201d Stiles says, finally looking over to give Derek a judgmental look. \u201c<em>Your\u00a0</em>Quidditch captain.\u201d</p>\n<p>That\u2019s when it finally clicks.</p>\n<p>Stiles isn\u2019t worried about\u00a0<em>himself</em>. He\u2019s worried about Derek.</p>\n<p>For some reason, that makes Derek furious.</p>\n<p>\u201cStiles,\u201d he growls only for Stiles to ignore him completely. Stiles\u2019 leg is bouncing up and down even faster now, eyes flicking around the room as he chews on his bottom lip.</p>\n<p>Derek knocks his elbow into Stiles\u2019.</p>\n<p>\u201cStop it,\u201d Derek says. \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you want help with this potion or not?\u201d Derek snaps, scowling.</p>\n<p>Stiles blinks at him. Frowns.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t,\u201d he says, glaring just as hard as Derek. Derek is unsure when this became a fight but that\u2019s fine. He\u2019s in the right mood for it anyway.</p>\n<p>\u201cToo bad,\u201d Derek says. \u201cYou\u2019re cutting your caterpillars wrong.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI am\u00a0<em>not</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, you are,\u201d Derek says, snatching the knife out of Stiles\u2019 hands. \u201cWatch.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI do not need-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou do,\u201d Derek says. \u201cYou missed three\u00a0<em>years</em>\u00a0of basics. We\u2019re meeting up on Tuesday nights to go over this.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles gapes at him for a moment. Then,</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Fine</em>,\u201d he says. A beat. \u201cWhere?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe library,\u201d Derek offers. \u201cWhere we studied that one time.\u201d He realizes it a beat after he says it that Stiles might not have that exact location of their study session almost three weeks ago memorized like Derek because he might not be a\u00a0<em>crazy person</em>. \u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201c6 o\u2019clock,\u201d Stiles says.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s\u00a0<em>dinner time</em>,\u201d Derek says, exasperated. As if he needed another reminder Stiles skips dinner almost every night.</p>\n<p>\u201cAright, 8 o\u2019clock,\u201d Stiles grumbles. As if\u00a0<em>he\u2019s\u00a0</em>the one doing the favor.</p>\n<p>\u201cGreat,\u201d Derek replies. \u201cNow watch me chop these caterpillars.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles huffs and manages to be silent for all of three seconds. Then,</p>\n<p>\u201cYou know this is disgusting, right?\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek sighs. He\u2019s not sure what he\u2019s just gotten himself into.</p>\n<p>But for some reason, he is in a better mood.</p>\n<p>*^*^*^</p>\n<p>Stiles isn\u2019t quite right.</p>\n<p>Derek\u2019s new seat in Potions causes some whispers and more than a few looks and, for a few days, that knowledge paired with the now rather epic tale that is circulating about him punching Collins, creates what Laura calls \u201ca bit of a stir.\u201d</p>\n<p>But, it doesn\u2019t cause \u201cproblems.\u201d In fact, all things considered, it dies down pretty quickly. The rumor adjusts itself and within a week, people seem convinced that Slughorn\u00a0<em>made</em>\u00a0Derek switch seats, and more importantly, Stiles and Derek do nothing but argue so there\u2019s nothing to worry about. The rift between Gryffindor and Slytherin remains intact. The social order lives on.</p>\n<p>It annoys Derek. Because generally he doesn\u2019t have very many friends\u00a0<em>anyway</em>and he doesn\u2019t really want that many friends and so maybe he\u2019s just never noticed how deep the Gryffindor/Slytherin divide goes.</p>\n<p>Most people are best friends with people from their own House. That\u2019s just how it is. Students share some classes with the other Houses, but you are together in\u00a0<em>every</em>\u00a0class with your Housemates and you sleep with them and eat with them but\u2026 friendships between the Houses\u00a0<em>happen</em>. As do relationships.</p>\n<p>And, okay, yes, he\u2019s aware that the bias against Slytherin hasn\u2019t completely gone away yet. The fact remains that most of them have family who fought on the wrong side of the War and their House is still literally known for cunning and pride and many of the oldest Wizarding families run through Slytherin and, so, yes, maybe Slytherins are a little less likely to form friendships outside of their House.</p>\n<p>He just never assumed that he wouldn\u2019t be\u00a0<em>allowed</em>\u00a0to befriend a Slytherin. That there was some weird stigma against it. He thought that the reason there were less friendships between Slytherins and the others (and virtually none between Slytherins and Gryffindors) was because Slytherins didn\u2019t\u00a0<em>want</em>\u00a0to be friends with anyone else. Or- or something like that.</p>\n<p>And now he\u2019s realizing that that might not be true. That it was a bloody stupid thing to think in the first place.</p>\n<p>Because suddenly he\u2019s noticing every little barb made against the Slytherin House. The most frequent insult around the Common Room is to call someone a \u201cSlyth.\u201d Green is\u00a0<em>never</em>\u00a0worn by anyone from the other houses, even though trading ties and trying to sneak into other classes is something of a Hogwarts tradition.</p>\n<p>And, often, far too often, it\u2019s just as Cora said: \u201cHe\u2019s a Slytherin. He\u2019s a git.\u201d As if that is the only explanation necessary.</p>\n<p>So, it\u2019s stupid and he\u2019s stupid for not realizing it sooner and he\u2019s even more stupid because he should have squashed the rumors that Slughorn\u00a0<em>made</em>\u00a0him sit with Stilinski sooner. But he didn\u2019t. Because he\u2019s not sure where that one even came from and the second half of it- that he and Stiles do nothing but fight \u2013 is fairly accurate.</p>\n<p>They do fight. Stiles is constantly trying to find shortcuts and is completely unwilling to listen to Derek when he explains over and over that\u00a0<em>there</em>\u00a0<em>are no shortcuts in Potions, Stiles.</em>\u00a0Half the time, Stiles is playing with the ingredients rather than chopping them and the other half of the time, he asks random questions that don\u2019t make any sense and he and Derek end up basically yelling at each other almost every class.</p>\n<p>That doesn\u2019t mean he doesn\u2019t enjoy it.</p>\n<p>In fact, Tuesday nights have become his favorite night of the week. Even over Quidditch practice.</p>\n<p>Stiles is\u00a0<em>smart</em>\u00a0for one. He doesn\u2019t know any of the basics, the things that Derek takes completely for granted because he had grown up knowing that you can never use heating spells on potions, that you always have to use a real fire or else the magical components break down. Stiles doesn\u2019t already know why using different knifes is be important \u201cif it\u2019s all going in the same pot anyway\u201d (and he refuses to call it a caldron, not matter how many times Derek corrects him). He doesn\u2019t understand the most simple of steps and he is constantly rushing things and-</p>\n<p>And he\u2019s still smart as a whip.</p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t know anything but once you tell him something, he remembers it. And Derek is horrified to find out that he\u2019s been limping by these past few weeks without Derek by going back and trying to read up on all the ingredients he\u2019s going to need before even using it. He blushes when he admits that he often gets too distracted to get through all of them but he has an entire\u00a0<em>scroll</em>\u00a0of notes on Scarab beetles.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s freaking creative for another thing. Derek mentions that his handwriting has gotten better, and Stiles smirks and tells him that actually he created a spell that automatically fixes up the lettering after he finishes writing. Derek stumbles on a whole scrolls that\u2019s filled with what looks like spell design and he can\u2019t even begin to figure out what they would be used for. He doesn\u2019t get the chance to ask because Stiles is saying something ridiculous like \u201cCould you brew some kind of Polyjuice potion and change just your bottom half into an animal or something?\u201d Which, again, is ridiculous but it\u2019s also something\u00a0<em>new</em>. Something that Derek doubts anyone else has ever asked before.</p>\n<p>And\u2026 the magic. Derek has known for a while that Stiles can do wandless magic and the rest of the school is now aware, but Derek doesn\u2019t think anyone (except maybe the teachers) realizes the full\u00a0<em>extent</em>\u00a0to which Stiles doesn\u2019t need his wand. \u00a0Or words. Working with Stiles is endlessly distracting because not only is\u00a0<em>Stiles</em>\u00a0constantly in motion, but everything around him is too. Books are constantly opening to new pages and he\u2019s worked out how to have ink fly itself onto his quill when he taps it and Stiles blinks in confusion when Derek asks him how he already knows the\u00a0<em>Accio</em>\u00a0spell but things fly towards them as needed all the same.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s not peaceful, exactly, not unless he catches Stiles on a day when Stiles looks like he hasn\u2019t slept the night before and everything moves a bit more sluggishly, but Derek loves it all the same.</p>\n<p>He just doesn\u2019t know how to extent their contact any further. And he wants to.</p>\n<p>But Stiles still carefully keeps to himself in their other two classes and he sometimes nods if they pass each other in the hallway, but sometimes he doesn\u2019t (Derek hasn\u2019t been able to work out what decides the change). And so maybe Stiles doesn\u2019t enjoy working with Derek as much as he seems to. Maybe their mostly-playful fights and Stiles\u2019 always playfully smug smirks are just for show.</p>\n<p>Derek is getting desperate. There has to be a way-</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you going to Hogsmeade this weekend?\u201d he blurts one Tuesday in November as they are packing up.</p>\n<p>\u201cUh, yeah,\u201d Stiles says, not quite looking up from shoving things into his bag. His face is almost entirely hidden by the hood of one his many Muggle sweatshirts. The second the weather went below 20 degrees, he started wearing them whenever he\u2019s not in class (aka he\u2019s worn them all year). Despite this, Stiles is constantly doing warming spelling on himself. Stiles claims that humans are not meant to withstand such temperatures. \u201cYeah, I am. You?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Derek says, shifting. \u201cTotally. Maybe we can meet up or something?\u201d</p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t quite know what\u2019s happening. It appears his mouth is moving without his permission.</p>\n<p>And what has come out sounds a weird attempt at asking Stiles on a\u2026 date? Which wasn\u2019t he meant to do. Obviously. He just wants to be friends or- well, at least friends for right now because Stiles clearly needs a friend but he is also, like, attractive so maybe one day, if Stiles wants, but not-</p>\n<p>God, even in his head, this is a disaster.</p>\n<p>\u201cI mean, maybe I\u2019ll see you there,\u201d he clarifies, praying to God that Stiles doesn\u2019t see how red he is.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Stiles\u2019 face flicks into a smile that doesn\u2019t seem quite natural. \u201cMaybe.\u201d</p>\n<p>It\u2019s a decided non-answer and Derek tries to tell himself that Stiles didn\u2019t say<em>no</em>, so that has to mean something but-</p>\n<p>\u201cLater, Derek!\u201d Stiles says and then leaves.</p>\n<p>At least maybe he didn\u2019t notice anything.</p>\n<p>*^*^*^</p>\n<p>Derek doesn\u2019t see Stiles in Hogsmeade.</p>\n<p>He heads first The Three Broomsticks and grabs a pint of Butterbeer with Boyd, Isaac, and Erica and stays for a while, hoping Stiles will come in from the cold eventually.</p>\n<p>He goes to Zonko\u2019s next because that seems like the kind of store Stiles would like. Stiles isn\u2019t there either.</p>\n<p>And then he just keeps wandering. He goes past Honeydukes and Spintwitches (where he gets mildly distracted by the new Nimbus 3X) and ends up getting his hair trimmed because he can\u2019t think of a good excuse for walking into the salon.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s disappointing and when he gets back to Hogwarts with the others, he finds he doesn\u2019t really feel like watching everyone examine and exchange whatever trinkets they picked up from the stores.</p>\n<p>So he politely thanks the people who compliment his new haircut, delivers Cora the supplies from Zonko\u2019s, and then leaves.</p>\n<p>It turns out that it\u2019s the moment he gives up looking for Stiles that he finds him.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s meandering through the lower levels of the school not really paying attention to where he\u2019s going when he sees a flash of red turn around a corner and then-</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Mister Stilinski!</em>\u201d it\u2019s not one voice but dozens that cry out in welcome. Derek lengthens his stride and then slows and peeks into the kitchen.</p>\n<p>Stiles is standing there with a bag from Honeydukes, elves crowded around him, all talking over each other in their haste to welcome him.</p>\n<p>\u201cHi, everyone!\u201d Stiles says, laughing as a few of them literally jump up and grab his arms in greeting. \u201cI bring gifts!\u201d He manages to make his way to one of the huge islands and spills the bag over the surface. \u201cI couldn\u2019t get too much,\u201d he says, frowning a little. \u201cBut I think if people split them, then maybe everyone can have at least a piece.\u201d</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a round of Thank You\u2019s and Derek can no longer make out what Stiles is saying because he\u2019s bending down to talk to a few elves in turn, grinning and shaking his head when he\u2019s repeatedly offered a piece. Derek finds himself leaning closer to try to somehow catch what Stiles is saying even though his back is now towards the door.</p>\n<p>\u201cExcuse me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek jumps at the very serious voice that suddenly booms across the kitchen. Silence falls instantly as one elf straightens and walks towards Derek as the crowd parts for him.</p>\n<p>\u201cThere are no students allowed in the kitchens.\u201d The elf tells him and Derek sees Stiles sort of flinch. Suddenly there are at least twenty sets of eyes glaring at him. A few go so far as to step in front of Stiles as if they will protect him if Derek tries to enter.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s not going to try to enter. Elf power is practically legendary at this point and he is well aware that even if he\u00a0<em>had</em>\u00a0his wand out and ready, they could easily take him.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d he says, his voice at a higher decibel than usual. \u201cOh, no, I was just-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDerek?\u201d Stiles says, voice slightly confused. At least he turns and sees Derek there. That\u2019s good. Maybe he can convince his friends not to kill him.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou know this student?\u201d the elf who seems to be in charge says.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, Harley, wait up,\u201d Stiles says, carefully stepping around elves. \u201cThat\u2019s Derek. Derek Hale.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou like him?\u201d the elf says, glancing back at Stiles for just a moment. Derek holds his breath. Stiles laughs.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, Harley, jeez,\u201d Stiles replies. \u201cDon\u2019t kill him! He\u2019s the one teaching me potions!\u201d</p>\n<p>It\u2019s as if a spell is broken. In an instant, the leader, Harley, is beaming at him and suddenly at least three different elves are grabbing his hands and pulling him into the kitchen and-</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you here to help with Thanksgiving?\u201d one asks him, nodding furiously as if to encourage him to say yes.</p>\n<p>\u201cUh-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to make Brussel sprouts with\u00a0<em>bacon</em>,\u201d another tells him. \u201c<em>American\u00a0</em>bacon.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe had it special ordered,\u201d a third adds.</p>\n<p>\u201cUm, guys,\u201d Stiles says. \u201cI don\u2019t think Derek wants to-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s not here to learn?\u201d an elf interrupts. She\u2019s frowning.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, he-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI am,\u201d Derek says quickly because that seems to be the right answer. \u201cOf course!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cINGREDIENTS!\u201d Harley yells and suddenly all the elves are scattering throughout the kitchen.</p>\n<p>\u201cRemember it\u2019s just a test run!\u201d Stiles calls over the fray. \u201cWe\u2019re not making the full meal! Small sizes, guys! Only feeding ourselves!\u201d</p>\n<p>He slides a few steps closer to Derek.</p>\n<p>\u201cSorry,\u201d he says. \u201cI think you\u2019re stuck here now.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s fine,\u201d Derek replies quickly. Maybe too quickly. It\u2019s more than fine, really. It\u2019s Stiles smiling and laughing and giving fist bumps to elves as they walk by without looking and- \u201cBut what is happening?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d Stiles says, blushing a little bit. \u201cThey\u2019re teaching me to cook with magic.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek raises his eyebrows. Stiles opens his mouth to answer, but-</p>\n<p>\u201cStiles has been learning since September,\u201d a passing elf tells them. She is very round and looks a little proud. \u201cHe is improving.\u201d</p>\n<p>She walks past quickly and when Derek looks back to Stiles again, he looks delighted.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s Pauline,\u201d he says in a whisper. \u201cShe thinks everything I make is terrible!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s cause humans can\u2019t cook,\u201d a much smaller elf says, looking up at Derek.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey!\u201d Stiles says. \u201cI\u2019m a great cook!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFor a human,\u201d Harley says.</p>\n<p>Derek\u2019s head is spinning a little bit.</p>\n<p>\u201cWha- when?\u201d he manages. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, um, my mom used to be a cook,\u201d Stiles says, suddenly very interested in rearranging the onions that have already been laid on the counter. \u201cSo when she- well, I took over and then, I guess I sorta missed it after coming here so\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles sort of shrugs and he\u2019s looking down and rubbing the back of his neck, clearly embarrassed.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he says. \u201cI wandered around until I found the kitchens and I was going to just do some good old fashioned Muggle cooking in the middle of the night but-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo one cooks in my kitchen without me knowing,\u201d Harley says seriously.</p>\n<p>\u201cPsh,\u201d Stiles replies, perking up a little. \u201cI made a whole omelet before you got here.\u201d He\u2019s grinning but Derek watches Harley and recognizes the little twitch of Harley\u2019s lips.</p>\n<p>He highly doubts that Harley wasn\u2019t aware the moment Stiles stepped into his kitchen.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou managed for ten minutes,\u201d Harley grumbles good naturedly. \u201cNow enough chit-chat. Let\u2019s get to work.\u201d</p>\n<p>The next hour and a half is a whirl wind. The elves all work together as if it\u2019s a coordinated dance and Stiles seems to know enough of the steps to at least bounce along and though some of the elves try to hide it, all of them clearly adore him. Stiles gets tips and tricks and is allowed to taste the food as it\u2019s cooking and occasionally gives directions as it\u2019s his Thanksgiving dinner they seem to be making.</p>\n<p>Derek is used more as a human errand boy. He chops what\u2019s put in front of him and reaches for things placed on the high shelves and the one time he pulls his wand out to make dice the garlic, he gets it literally smacked out of his hand by Pauline.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo wands!\u201d she snaps. \u201cThey\u00a0<em>ruin</em>\u00a0the food!\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek blushes and Stiles laughs at him and the tiny elf from before \u2013 Daisy \u2013 tells him that that\u2019s why Stiles is the first human they\u2019ve\u00a0<em>ever</em>\u00a0taught, because he\u2019s the one only who could even begin to master elf cooking and Stiles is just starting to smirk a little, when Harley jabs him in the shin and tells him not to get cocky and-</p>\n<p>It\u2019s the best time Derek has had in weeks.</p>\n<p>The kitchen is insane and Stiles is smiling the whole time and different elves keep introducing themselves to him and he\u2019s frantic to get their names right but it\u2019s\u00a0<em>impossible</em>.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou get them all eventually,\u201d Stiles whispers in his ear as he leans over to grab the garlic that Derek had spent almost twenty minutes dicing. He frowns, mutters something, and suddenly the garlic is chopped even finer and Derek is positive he did that just to show off.</p>\n<p>\u201cExcept for the triplets,\u201d Stiles says, glancing in the direction of the three elves currently arguing about the pumpkin pie. \u201cJust avoid direct address with them.\u201d</p>\n<p>A second later the three dissolve into a fist fight.</p>\n<p>Derek doesn\u2019t really notice it happening but suddenly food is finishing and Stiles gets the first bite of everything and is then ruthlessly quizzed as to whether or not it is \u201cproper American\u201d food. And then Derek is being instructed to eat as well.</p>\n<p>Refusing doesn\u2019t seem to be an option. He doesn\u2019t manage to give very good opinions, not like Stiles who is locked in a serious discussion with an elf named Tang about whether or not they should put more cream cheese in the mashed potatoes, but the elves beam at him anyway.</p>\n<p>\u201cTime to clean up,\u201d Harley announces eventually. Derek is pretty sure he is going to die. He\u2019s that full.</p>\n<p>\u201cAlright,\u00a0<em>now</em>, you can use your wand,\u201d Stiles tells Derek as the elves rush to put ingredients away. \u201cYou know where the pigs are out behind the Gamekeeper\u2019s hut? Banish all the food there.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek still feels slightly out of place using a wand with the elves and Stiles merely muttering and snapping at plates but he notices that he\u00a0<em>is</em>\u00a0able to do more at once, which is nice, and he smirks just a little at Stiles.</p>\n<p>Stiles rolls his eyes.</p>\n<p>Leaving is another ten minute affair, with Stiles accepting a bag of something and then leaning down to hug almost every elf and promising to be back soon, and yes, Thanksgiving is definitely on Thursday. It\u2019s on Thursday every year.</p>\n<p>It seems the only way to get away for Stiles is to keep talking and slowly back towards the door so Derek hangs back and lets him do that and then-</p>\n<p>\u201cMister Hale,\u201d Harley says, snagging Derek by the wrist as he goes to follow Stiles out. \u201cYou must make sure he eats. He skips too many meals. Not good.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUh, okay,\u201d Derek says, feeling himself turning red. He does not see Stiles as often as Harley and the others think he does. He could try to get Stiles to eat dinner on Tuesdays. Aside from that, he\u2019s practically useless. But he has no idea how to explain that. Or if he should even try. \u201cOkay, I will. I\u2019ll try.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGood,\u201d Harley replies, nodding seriously as if he and Derek had just come to a formal agreement. He holds out a bag. \u201cNow take these. They\u2019re your favorite.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek tries to protest, but Stiles sticks his head back in long enough to glance at him, realize the situation, and shake his head.</p>\n<p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Derek says instead. \u201cThank you very much.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, thank you\u2019s,\u201d Harley says. \u201cJust watch out for Mister Stilinski. Be a good friend.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek goes to nod again, open his mouth to say thank you one more time, but Harley snaps his fingers and suddenly Derek is being propelled out the door.</p>\n<p>Stiles catches him before he can careen into the far wall.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou tried to refuse the food, didn\u2019t you?\u201d he asks, holding up his own bag. It looks even bigger than Derek\u2019s. \u201cRookie mistake.\u201d</p>\n<p>Something in Derek\u2019s bag starts\u00a0<em>moving</em>\u00a0and he\u2019s concerned at first until he opens it and finds a pile of home-made chocolate frogs.</p>\n<p>*^*^*^</p>\n<p>On Thursday, all the tables of the Great Hall are full with the dishes he\u2019s already tried and when he looks across the room, he sees that Stiles is actually at dinner for once. He\u2019s reading a pile of papers rather than a book but he seems to actually notice Derek\u2019s stare this time.</p>\n<p>At least, he looks up and they make eye contact.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Happy Thanksgiving</em>,\u201d Derek mouths across the Great Hall.</p>\n<p>Stiles smiles, just a little.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Thanks.\u201d</em></p>\n<p>*^*^*^</p>\n<p>\u201cSorry, I\u2019m late,\u201d Derek grunts a few days later, throwing his books down with a bit more force than necessary.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s annoyed he\u2019s almost half an hour late because that cuts into his time with Stiles, but he\u2019s also annoyed \u2013 no,\u00a0<em>furious</em>\u00a0because-</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Stiles asks, frowning at him.</p>\n<p>Derek sucks in a breath. Opens his mouth to tell Stiles that it\u2019s nothing, that he\u2019s fine.</p>\n<p>\u201cSome asshole Slyths stole Cora\u2019s diary,\u201d he says instead. \u201cFucking twats grabbed it when she was eating lunch or something and opened it and started reading aloud before the teachers arrived. Then they Banished it somewhere and they won\u2019t tell her where.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek scowls. \u201cThey\u2019re threatening to post the whole thing around school if she tells anyone and, obviously, she\u2019s only eleven so it\u2019s not like there is anything<em>in</em>\u00a0there but-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut she\u2019s really upset,\u201d he finishes. \u201cShe spend the last hour crying to me and Laura and Laura\u00a0<em>says</em>\u00a0that she\u2019ll talk to the Slytherin prefects but we all know they\u2019ll just deny knowing where it is \u2018cause they\u2019re bloody Slyther-\u201d</p>\n<p>Abruptly, Derek remember who he\u2019s talking to.</p>\n<p>\u201cSorry,\u201d he says, flushing. \u201cSorry, it\u2019s not just \u2018cause they\u2019re Slytherins. It\u2019s just\u2026 they\u2019re assholes. Cora\u2019s mortified and Laura\u2019s pissed and-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d Stiles says shortly and Derek can\u2019t quite tell if he\u2019s telling the truth. \u201cWho were they?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFifth years- that Kali and Ennis couple,\u201d Derek replies, feeling his jaw clench. \u201cFucking wankers.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d Stiles says softly. \u201cYeah, they are kind of jerks.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Derek takes a deep breath. There\u2019s no use getting angry about it. At least, not now. Their Potions final is in two and a half weeks. \u201cLet\u2019s focus. Potions.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAlright,\u201d Stiles agrees. But then falls into an uncharacteristic silence. And that gives Derek the opportunity to replay what he\u2019s just said in his head and-</p>\n<p>\u201cI really am sorry,\u201d Derek says after a few awkward minutes. Stiles looks up at him. \u201cFor what I said. About Slytherins. I didn\u2019t really mean it, I just-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a big deal,\u201d Stiles assures him, shrugging. \u201cYou grew up hating Slytherins, it\u2019s not like you can change that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Derek says, blinking in surprise. \u201cNo, no, I didn\u2019t grow up hating Slytherins. That\u2019s not- \u00a0that\u2019s not true.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOoo-kay,\u201d Stiles says, his whole face going disbelieving.</p>\n<p>\u201cI didn\u2019t!\u201d Derek says. \u201cI wasn\u2019t taught to hate anyone!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not saying you were\u00a0<em>taught</em>\u00a0to hate anyone,\u201d Stiles says quickly, putting his hands up in a calming manner. \u201cI\u2019m just saying\u2026 well, dude, the first thing you pointed out about Kali and Ennis was that they were Slytherins. And then you implied that Slytherins would lie, like other kids in other House wouldn\u2019t, and\u2026 look, it\u2019s fine. I didn\u2019t take it personally. Seriously.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Derek says again. His anger has almost completely shifted into guilt. It feels even worse.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo problem,\u201d Stiles says. \u201cNow\u2026 potions?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI just\u2026 I wish you weren\u2019t a Slytherin, sometimes,\u201d Derek admits. It would be easier. They could just be friends openly and Derek wouldn\u2019t have to worry about saying the wrong thing at times like this. They could eat breakfast together and Derek could make sure Stiles was eating the other two meals of the day and-</p>\n<p>\u201cHey,\u201d Stiles says, his voice a little sharp for the first time in their conversation. \u201cThat\u2019s messed up. I\u00a0<em>like</em>\u00a0being a Slytherin.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Derek says. \u201cNo, you don\u2019t.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUh, yes, I do,\u201d Stiles replies. \u201cThe Slytherin traits? Cunning, resourcefulness, and ambition? Yeah, sign me up. Those are awesome.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut, you\u2026 you hated it,\u201d Derek replies, feeling more and more confused by the moment. \u201cAt the Owlery\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI said I hated that everyone\u00a0<em>else</em>\u00a0hated me automatically,\u201d Stiles corrects. \u201cThat\u2019s not a Slytherin problem. That\u2019s a Rest-of-the-School problem.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou said they hated you too,\u201d Derek mutters and he can\u2019t help it. It comes out a tad whiney.</p>\n<p>\u201cI mean, most of them do,\u201d Stiles agrees easily. \u201cBut, dude, I came in here and basically fucked up the curve in half their classes and\u00a0<em>am</em>\u00a0loud and obnoxious and I do lose us a\u00a0<em>fuckton</em>\u00a0of points. I\u2019d hate me too.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt just sounds like they\u2019re jealous,\u201d Derek replies. \u201cAnd House Points are no reason to hate anyone. You said it yourself, it doesn\u2019t even mean anything.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTrue,\u201d Stiles says, nodding. \u201cBut did you know that Slytherin hasn\u2019t won the House Cup since the big war you guys always talk about? It ended like fifteen years ago and they haven\u2019t won since. Haven\u2019t had a Head Boy or Girl either. This is a House that literally\u00a0<em>prides</em>\u00a0itself on pride. And apparently the Slytherin grades are almost always as high, if not better, than the other Houses. They just don\u2019t get as many random points throughout the day. Slughorn is the only teacher that regularly rewards Slytherin students. And it\u2019s still not enough. They don\u2019t win anymore. People are mad about it. And they can\u2019t be pissed at the rest of the school since that\u2019s what got them into trouble in the first place, so they\u2019re pissed at me. Which is fine. I honestly don\u2019t care.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek can\u2019t think of anything to say. He hadn\u2019t even known that the Slytherins hadn\u2019t won since the War. And everyone else in the school sees Slughorn as an obnoxious example of favoritism, but maybe\u2026</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd even though they hate me,\u201d Stiles continues, pulling out paper. \u201cAt least they\u2019re interesting about it. All the tricks they try to pull are subtle and they almost always give me a chance to try to work my way out of it and\u2026 well, I respect them. I think most of them respect me too at this point. At least, the other day, two sixth years warned me that douchebag Grant from Hufflepuff was in the Greenhouse messing with my Mallowsweet.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI- I didn\u2019t\u2026 I\u2019ve never thought of it like that,\u201d Derek admits softly. It still seems strange to him. To like and respect people who hated you.</p>\n<p>\u201cI mean, don\u2019t get me wrong, some of us are assholes,\u201d Stiles replies. \u201cLike Kali and Ennis. Total fuckers. But there are assholes in every House. And most of us aren\u2019t\u00a0<em>that</em>\u00a0bad.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek nods mutely or at least he tries to and then Stiles is helpfully shoving a book in his face.</p>\n<p>\u201cAlright dude, enough weird magic politics. We need to make sure I\u2019m not going to fail Potions.\u201d</p>\n<p>*^*^*^</p>\n<p>It\u2019s weird that someone who spend an alarming amount of time dropping, losing, or somehow mangling his quill or generally injuring himself while sitting is still able to completely surprise Derek when he wants to.</p>\n<p>But Derek descends the ladder from Divination, turns down one hallway and then almost doesn\u2019t notice it when Stiles slides up next to him.</p>\n<p>\u201cStiles!\u201d Derek says, trying not to show how thrilled he is. He almost never gets to see Stiles on Wednesdays. And he\u2019d stayed up half the night thinking about what Stiles had said and realizing just how right he was. In all the other Houses, the assholes are considered the exception. But with Slytherin, the ones who manage to have friends outside of Slytherins,\u00a0<em>they\u2019re</em>\u00a0the exception. And that\u2019s ridiculous and he needs to know\u00a0<em>more</em>. Is there documented evidence that Slytherin students don\u2019t get as many House points? Do the prefects ever talk about this? What exactly would happen if-</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s about Potions,\u201d Stiles starts, glancing around at the other people in the area. \u201cI need you to-\u201d</p>\n<p>He stops suddenly and all but shoves Derek into an empty classroom. Derek can only stare as Stiles glares around the room suspiciously.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat are you-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHere,\u201d Stiles says, reaching into his bag and pulling something out. \u201cGot it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek looks down. Blinks. Feels his mouth drop open in surprise.</p>\n<p>In Stiles\u2019 hand is Cora\u2019s\u00a0<em>diary</em>.</p>\n<p>\u201cBut- how?\u201d he asks.</p>\n<p>Stiles grins. \u201cI\u2019ve got my ways, Derek.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou-\u201d Derek keeps gaping.</p>\n<p>\u201cC\u2019mon,\u201d Stiles says, still smirking. \u201cLike those freaking losers are going to out-Slytherin me? Please. I\u2019m the smartest of the lot.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut, you,\u201d Derek says. \u201cYou don\u2019t even\u00a0<em>know</em>\u00a0Cora.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, well,\u201d The smirk slides from Stiles\u2019 face as he lifts one shoulder. \u201cShe\u2019s your sister, right?\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek doesn\u2019t really know how to respond to that, but luckily Stiles is already moving away.</p>\n<p>\u201cGotta get to class, dude,\u201d he says, lifting his hand in a strange wave. \u201cOh, and don\u2019t tell anyone I got that for you. I mean, I can outwit \u2018em any day, but those fifth years are\u00a0<em>huge</em>. They\u2019d find a way to kill me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI- I won\u2019t,\u201d Derek promises because Stiles voice had come out playful but his eyes are a bit serious.</p>\n<p>\u201cOr I\u2019d have to kill them to\u00a0<em>stop</em>\u00a0them from killing me,\u201d Stiles continues, waving a hand flippantly. \u201cIt would be a mess. Say you found it on the stairs to the Owlery or something. Blame their craptastic Banishing skills.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cStiles,\u201d Derek says, wishing that he could make Stiles stop moving for just a second. Stiles glances over his shoulder. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about,\u201d Stiles says and then with a cheeky salute, he\u2019s gone.</p>\n<p>*^*^*^</p>\n<p>Cora is ecstatic. She jumps up and down and declares him to be the best big brother in the entire\u00a0<em>universe</em>\u00a0and, even though he says he found it up by the Owlery per Stiles\u2019 suggestion, by the end of the day, Cora is telling people that he used highly advanced magic to track it down himself and basically fought Kali and Ennis off with his wand hand behind his back.</p>\n<p>Which he didn\u2019t do.</p>\n<p>Stiles did.</p>\n<p>He opens his mouth maybe a thousand times to just\u00a0<em>tell</em>\u00a0her that it was Stiles, especially when the rhetoric around the House quickly becomes another tale of \u2018Gryffindor beats Slytherin: The World Rejoices\u2019 but Stiles had asked him not to and Stiles has to\u00a0<em>live</em>\u00a0with them.</p>\n<p>So he sticks to repeating the \u201creal\u201d story \u2013\u00a0<em>I just went up to see Twinkles and found it by the Owlery</em>\u00a0\u2013 over and over again until it dies down.</p>\n<p>When it comes to Stiles, any attempt at thanks is waved off with a dismissive hand and so Derek does the only thing he can think of.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey,\u201d he says as they pack up their stuff. It was their last Potions study session of the semester. The exam is on Thursday and then Christmas break officially starts Friday afternoon. \u201cWould you like to swing by the kitchens?\u201d</p>\n<p>He has an exam the next day, but it\u2019s just Transfiguration and Stiles has taken to showing him a few tricks at their end of their potions sessions so Derek feels fine about it. He can wake up early and study in the morning anyway.</p>\n<p>Stiles raises an eyebrow.</p>\n<p>\u201cReally?\u201d he asks, smirking a little. \u201cGryffindor goody-two shoes is going to break curfew?\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek scowls at him. Okay, yes, usually he heads back to the common room after he and Stiles finish because, unlike Stiles, he doesn\u2019t\u00a0<em>enjoy</em>\u00a0losing points and getting detentions and he can\u2019t afford to miss Quidditch practice but that doesn\u2019t mean he\u00a0<em>never</em>\u00a0breaks the rules. He just prefers not to.</p>\n<p>\u201cAlright, alright,\u201d Stiles says, reading the answer on his face. \u201cC\u2019mon. I know all the passages the teachers don\u2019t bother patrolling.\u201d</p>\n<p>It turns out that Stiles knows all the passages Derek didn\u2019t even know\u00a0<em>existed</em>. Derek spends half the journey thinking they are going in the wrong direction but they wind up at the kitchens all the same.</p>\n<p>And Derek considers it a success because Stiles steps into the welcome and love of the elves as if he\u2019s stepping into sunlight. His shoulders relax in a way that they don\u2019t even do with Derek and his smile becomes a thousand times more genuine and one day Derek will figure out how to make Stiles laugh like that but for now, just listening to it is enough.</p>\n<p>They make three different kinds of Christmas biscuits. Stiles keeps getting wacked by elves for calling them cookies, Derek gets hit more than a few times for laughing at the sound of Stiles apologizing profusely to elves a third of his size, and they\u00a0<em>both</em>\u00a0get hit for trying to sneak bites of the dough.</p>\n<p>Stiles\u2019 smile goes sad a few times for no reason and Derek frowns and sometimes goes to say something, but the elves seem to have that under control as well. Sometimes they are on him in an instant, loudly yelling in his ear about whatever they believe he has done wrong; a few times Daisy takes the opportunity of Stiles\u2019 stillness to climb up to his shoulder and marvel at how tall he is. One time, they all seem to glance at Harley, who shakes his head minutely, and if by agreement, they all just let him be. They talk around him and don\u2019t ask him to do anything, and when Stiles shakes himself and reanimates a few minutes later, they all accept him back as if his blank stare and sluggish movements never even happened.</p>\n<p>At the end of it, Harley nods at Derek solemnly and his Take Away bag is even more packed with food than it was the last time.</p>\n<p>Derek takes that to mean he was right to bring Stiles here.</p>\n<p>\u201cAlrighty,\u201d Stiles says just outside the picture of the Fat Lady. He had offered to walk Derek back so that the teachers wouldn\u2019t catch him. It\u2019s almost midnight. Derek is just now realizing that he hadn\u2019t had to tell Stiles where the Gryffindor dorm room was. \u201cBack safe and sound. Your honor intact.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAt least I have honor,\u201d Derek mutters, but they\u2019re both smiling.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou wound me,\u201d Stiles says. \u201cI should have abandoned you in the dungeons.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, get out of here,\u201d Derek says. \u201cYou\u2019re the worst.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAlways,\u201d Stiles grins. \u201cHey, if I don\u2019t see you before break, have a nice Christmas.\u201d</p>\n<p>Oh. Right. Exams are separated by House so Derek won\u2019t even be there to see if Stiles is screwing up the Potions mid-term and-</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he says, smile slipping. \u201cYeah, you too. You must be really excited to be going home.\u201d</p>\n<p>They wouldn\u2019t even be able to exchange owls. Not when it takes pretty much two weeks for Twinkles to fly back and forth. Still, two weeks isn\u2019t that-</p>\n<p>\u201cNah,\u201d Stiles says, shrugging one shoulder in that way he has that Derek is pretty sure he hates. \u201cI\u2019ll be here. Terrorizing the remaining staff and such. Probably try to find a few more sneaky ways to get through the school. The usual.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2026 you aren\u2019t going home?\u201d Derek asks. There are always a few students who don\u2019t go home for the break, but he just assumed Stiles would be psyched to see his dad and Scott again.</p>\n<p>\u201cDude,\u201d Stiles replies. \u201cPlane tickets remember? Over a thousand dollars. And it\u2019s a twelve hour flight- I nearly went crazy on the way here.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut\u2026 the Floo network?\u201d Derek suggests. \u201cCouldn\u2019t you-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTakes forever to get international clearance for that,\u201d Stiles says and his voice isn\u2019t angry but it goes a bit\u2026 forced. It\u2019s clear he doesn\u2019t want to talk about this. He takes a breath and smiles. \u201cBesides, I live in\u00a0<em>California</em>. We don\u2019t even have a fireplace to hook up.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek knows his face must be doing something ridiculous because Stiles looks over at him and his smile grows.</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about me, Der,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s really not a big de-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou should come to my house,\u201d Derek blurts before he really thinks about it. Stiles freezes. And then Derek does think about it for a moment and he realizes it\u2019s a great idea. They have\u00a0<em>tons</em>\u00a0of room and Stiles wouldn\u2019t have to be alone in this big castle and- \u201cIt\u2019ll be great. You can see a full Wizard House and we can hang out and\u2026 stuff!\u201d</p>\n<p>He grins. This is perfect. The perfect excuse to spend a whole two weeks with Stiles away from this stupid school and all the stupid people in it.</p>\n<p>\u201cReally?\u201d Stiles says and Derek\u2019s heart skips a beat when he realizes that Stiles sounds\u00a0<em>excited</em>. \u201cThat would be-</p>\n<p>\u201cWait,\u201d Stiles is suddenly frowning. \u201cWait, um, you haven\u2019t even checked with your family yet.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell\u2026 that doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d Derek says, his face matching Stiles\u2019. Okay, yes, they didn\u2019t generally have other people over for Christmas and even Isaac goes to Boyd\u2019s but that\u2019s because Isaac and Boyd are really close and Boyd had asked first. He\u2019s sure that once he explains that Stiles hadn\u2019t been\u00a0<em>invited</em>anywhere else, his parents will be fine with it. \u201cI can tell them you\u2019re coming tomorrow.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles is already shaking his head. \u201cNo, no, man,\u201d he says. \u201cI think you should check first. I mean\u2026 I\u2019ve never even talked to your sisters and I don\u2019t want to just crash your Christmas vacation. Christmas is an important time for family.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek wonders if he knows how ridiculous he sounds when he says that. Considering that a moment ago, he admitted that he didn\u2019t even get to be with his for Christmas.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sure they\u2019ll be fine with it,\u201d Derek says, sounding a bit exasperated.</p>\n<p>Stiles glances towards the Gryffindor crest on the wall.</p>\n<p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d he allows. \u201cBut- but if not, don\u2019t worry about it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll ask tomorrow,\u201d Derek says. \u201cWe leave on Saturday morning.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Stiles says but he doesn\u2019t sound sure. \u201cI\u2019ll, uh, I\u2019ll see you tomorrow then. Let me know.\u201d</p>\n<p>As usual, he\u2019s gone before Derek gets a chance to say anything else.</p>\n<p>*^*^*^</p>\n<p>\u201cYou invited a\u00a0<em>Slytherin</em>\u00a0to our house for Christmas?\u201d Cora exclaims when Derek tells them. He understands that she\u2019s not happy with that House at the moment, but his eyes still go flat. \u201cAfter what they did to me?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI didn\u2019t invite a Slytherin, I invited my\u00a0<em>friend</em>,\u201d Derek snaps, nerves sliding into his stomach. He needs his sisters to get on board with this. So that they can get their parents on board with this. \u201cHe was going to be stuck here alone for two weeks and so, yes, I asked him.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCora, don\u2019t be rude,\u201d Laura says and Derek hopes for a second that she is on his side, but her face doesn\u2019t soften when it turns to him. \u201cDerek, no one is he can\u2019t come because he\u2019s a Slytherin, but\u2026 but you can\u2019t just go inviting strangers to our house! For Christmas!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s not a stranger,\u201d Derek says. \u201cHe\u2019s my friend.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ve never ever seen you hang\u00a0<em>out</em>\u00a0with him,\u201d Cora mutters, a bit petulantly.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe have Potions together,\u201d Derek replies, trying not to roll his eyes. \u201cWe\u2019re partners.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBecause Slughorn\u00a0<em>made</em>\u00a0you help him,\u201d Laura says. Derek blinks. He hadn\u2019t thought they had heard that rumor.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s not true,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u00a0<em>offered</em>\u00a0to be his partner. Because I\u00a0<em>like</em>\u00a0him. As a friend. He\u2019s cool.\u201d</p>\n<p>Cora scoffs. Laura rolls her eyes.</p>\n<p>\u201cDerek, I literally\u00a0<em>heard</em>\u00a0him tell Matthias Baker that Slughorn made you guys sit together,\u201d Laura says. \u201cAnd he didn\u2019t sound too happy about it either so I don\u2019t know why you\u2019re trying to-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe said\u00a0<em>what</em>?\u201d Derek cries, something sinking in his stomach. \u201cThat\u2019s not- oh my\u00a0<em>god</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t really sound like you\u2019re friends,\u201d Cora says. She sounds smug. Derek is going to kill her. \u201cMaybe\u00a0<em>you</em>\u00a0think you are but-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u00a0<em>are</em>\u00a0friends,\u201d Derek snaps. \u201cWe study Potions together every Tuesday night and we cooked Thanksgiving dinner with the elves down in the kitchen and, you know why you haven\u2019t met him? Because I knew you both would be freaking\u00a0<em>rude</em>\u00a0about it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re not being\u00a0<em>rude</em>\u00a0about it,\u201d Cora snaps back. \u201cWe\u2019re just saying-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell don\u2019t\u00a0<em>just say</em>,\u201d Derek interrupts, his voice rising. \u201cBecause you know what?\u00a0<em>He\u2019s</em>\u00a0the one who made sure you got your diary back, Cora. Gave it to me the day after I told him about it and told me to claim I found it randomly so his own\u00a0<em>housemates</em>\u00a0wouldn\u2019t know that he was the one who stole it back and hate him even\u00a0<em>more</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>Cora\u2019s mouth falls open but Derek doesn\u2019t give her the chance to say anything.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd\u00a0<em>he\u2019s</em>\u00a0the one who hasn\u2019t even\u00a0<em>agreed to come yet</em>\u00a0because he wanted to make sure that\u00a0<em>my family</em>\u00a0was okay with it. But I guess they\u2019re not. So I\u2019ll just go tell him, he\u2019s uninvited, that he can just stay here,\u00a0<em>alone</em>, for two weeks over the holidays because he can\u2019t afford a ticket home and\u00a0<em>god forbid</em>\u00a0the Hales have a bloody\u00a0<em>Slytherin</em>\u00a0in their house.</p>\n<p>\u201cExcept,\u201d Derek continues, standing. \u201cNo. No, he won\u2019t be alone. Tell Mom and Dad I decided to stay too. Fuck this.\u201d</p>\n<p>He turns to leave, perfectly content to stalk out, but-</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Derek</em>,\u201d Laura snaps. Her tone makes it clear that his little temper tantrum isn\u2019t going to slide. \u201c<em>Calm down.</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>He bristles at her tone, which seems to consist of entirely judgement and rebuke and how\u00a0<em>dare</em>\u00a0she be mad at him when\u00a0<em>she\u2019s</em>\u00a0the one who is being a complete tosser, but- but then he eyes flick to Cora and Derek realizes abruptly that he had just yelled at his\u00a0<em>eleven</em>\u00a0year old sister. Cora\u2019s face is white and her eyes are filled with tears and-</p>\n<p>He\u2019s still mad but he suddenly doesn\u2019t feel very good about it.</p>\n<p>He sits down.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re sorry,\u201d Laura starts, which is a good thing because Derek thinks if she said anything else, he might have hit her. \u201cWe\u00a0<em>are</em>. It was shitty of us to try to somehow prove you two aren\u2019t friends.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek nods decisively. It was. \u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cBut,\u201d Laura says and Derek feels his jaw go square. \u201cBut, Derek, in the\u00a0<em>four months</em>\u00a0that we have been in school, you have mentioned Stilinski - Stiles \u2013 exactly once. When you told us you lent him our owl, which, I think, we both thought was just you being nice.\u201d</p>\n<p>Cora nods her head miserably. Derek opens his mouth to say something but Laura holds up her hand.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo, you can\u2019t blame us for being a bit\u2026 surprised,\u201d she continues. \u201cYou never told us about learning Potions together \u2013 the one time I\u00a0<em>asked</em>\u00a0you about potions, you just said it was \u2018fine.\u2019 So, you can be mad at us all you want for being rude or judging him because he\u2019s a Slytherin, but, Derek, you weren\u2019t exactly announcing that you two were friends either. And you didn\u2019t give us any chance to get to know him. And that wasn\u2019t fair. To him or us.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek opens his mouth. Closes it.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd you can\u2019t blow up every time someone asks you questions,\u201d Laura finishes. \u201cMom and Dad are going to be curious too. Because I\u2019m willing to bet you haven\u2019t mentioned him to\u00a0<em>them</em>\u00a0either.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Derek admits softly. He hadn\u2019t seen it as purposefully\u00a0<em>hiding</em>\u00a0Stiles. More\u2026 not rushing their friendship. Of course, that doesn\u2019t mean anything when he invites Stiles over for Christmas without even thinking about it.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell Mom and Dad when we talk in the fire tonight,\u201d Laura says and he knows that\u2019s her version of giving him a few days to prepare himself. She\u2019ll probably even make it seem like she and Cora knew all about Stiles. It\u2019s an apology and protection wrapped all up in one.</p>\n<p>She makes a good buffer for the conflict that sometimes erupts in their family. Always has.</p>\n<p>\u201cTell Stiles we\u2019re leaving at 8am on Saturday,\u201d she says, rising. \u201cSee you then.\u201d</p>\n<p>She leaves and Cora follows her and Derek is once against left thinking that he<em>always</em>\u00a0manages to screw things up.</p>\n<p>At least this time, he can fix it.</p>\n<p>*^*^*^</p>\n<p>Come Saturday morning, Derek finds himself feeling more confident. Confident and ready for many things.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s ready for his sisters to be awkward and maybe a little standoffish. He\u2019s ready for Stiles to be nervous. He\u2019s ready for his Mom to ask way too many invasive questions when they finally get to the house.</p>\n<p>He is\u00a0<em>not</em>\u00a0ready to see Stiles in full Muggle clothes.</p>\n<p>Stiles is near constantly getting uniform infractions for forgetting his tie or refusing to wear his vest or leaving his robes undone. Derek has actually seen his Muggle tennis shoes before (he thinks they\u2019re called Chucks or something) because Stiles tends to wear those every day until he gets told to change.</p>\n<p>But he is not ready to see Stiles in dark blue jeans, wearing a black shirt with some kind of bat symbol on it, a plaid shirt thrown over it and one of his famous hoodies thrown over that. He\u2019s not ready to see Stiles somehow look more like\u00a0<em>himself</em>\u00a0than ever before.</p>\n<p>And he\u2019s certainly not ready for Stiles to leap up from where he\u2019s sitting next to a ratty duffel bag with an oversized check on it and run his hands nervously through his hair.</p>\n<p>Derek has seen the motion before but\u2026 but, god, even when Wizards dress in regular clothes it\u2019s all jumpers and tweed jackets and American shirt sizes must run small because he can practically see Stiles\u2019 chest strain against his shirt at the movement.</p>\n<p>Derek must look like an idiot, he realizes. He\u2019s still wearing robes because\u2026 he\u2019s used to robes and it\u2019s chilly out and-</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you\u00a0<em>sure</em>\u00a0this is okay?\u201d Stiles asks, shifting his weight as if preparing to run back into the castle. \u201cLike, really, I don\u2019t know about this. Maybe\u2026 maybe I should just stay.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cStiles,\u201d Derek says, hoping his voice comes out even. \u201cIt\u2019s fine. Promise.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI dunno,\u201d Stiles mutters. \u201cI\u2019ve only ever stayed over at Scott\u2019s house and his mom is like\u2026\u00a0<em>used</em>\u00a0to me and- oh my god, should I still be wearing robes? I only have school robes but I could go get them. Is this\u2026 I don\u2019t have any formal clothes, Derek!\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek is well aware he\u2019s grinning like an idiot. He just can\u2019t stop.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou look fine, Stiles,\u201d he says. He\u2019s lying. Stiles doesn\u2019t look fine. He looks more than fine. He looks fantastic. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. Christmas is casual.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Stiles says. He takes a deep breath. \u201cOkay. I just\u2026 I can still just stay here. Your family-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMy family wants you to come,\u201d Derek says. It\u2019s true. At least he hopes it\u2019s true. He and his sisters hadn\u2019t exactly talked about it anymore and he hadn\u2019t talked to his parents\u00a0<em>directly</em>\u00a0but his mom had sent a separate owl to him asking if Stiles had any food allergies or preferences so\u2026 she\u2019s onboard. Which means everyone else will get on board. That\u2019s how their family works. \u201cThey\u2019re totally excited to meet you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles opens his mouth as if he\u2019s going to argue but then he spots something over Derek\u2019s shoulder and snaps it shut audibly.</p>\n<p>Derek turns to see his two sisters walking down the Hogwarts steps.</p>\n<p>They\u2019re an intimidating pair without trying to be. Laura is a good 10 cm taller than Derek, which means even\u00a0<em>taller</em>\u00a0than Stiles and Cora is already holding herself with all of Laura\u2019s confidence. And their dark hair and piercing green eyes don\u2019t exactly help matters.</p>\n<p>They walk up and Stiles starts fidgeting with the string of his sweatshirt and Derek finds himself glaring at his sisters. Even though this was his fault. Even though he really should have introduced them earlier. And in a less awkward setting.</p>\n<p>\u201cStiles!\u201d the voice that comes out of Laura\u2019s mouth is warm and welcoming. She\u2019s grabbing Stiles\u2019 hand as if they are old friends. \u201cIt\u2019s great to meet you!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe you got stuck being Derek\u2019s friend,\u201d Cora pipes up, her face the picture of younger sibling mischief. \u201cThat must suck.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek stares at them. Stiles does too but then Laura is asking him if he has everything and Stiles recovers enough to thank them for letting him come and Laura waves that off and-</p>\n<p>Derek doesn\u2019t get a chance to say much. He had forgotten how aggressively nice his sisters can be when they feel like it.</p>\n<p>Laura asks Stiles if he\u2019s ever used the Floo Network before and then patiently explains how it\u2019s done. Cora assured him that it\u2019s best to do it on an empty stomach because the first time\u00a0<em>Derek</em>\u00a0had used Floo, he threw up\u00a0<em>everywhere</em>and Derek grumbles a little at that story, but it makes Stiles laugh so he doesn\u2019t really mind.</p>\n<p>(Though, he minds a little. He still feels ridiculous standing next to Stiles when Stiles looks so bloody\u00a0<em>good</em>.)</p>\n<p>His sisters pop through the fireplace first and though Stiles has relaxed a little, he still tells Derek to go through first (<em>You should see your parents first, dude).</em></p>\n<p>So Derek goes through first and he can\u2019t help but grin at the sight of the cozy room his parents have set up for Floo Network. It\u2019s a perfect blend of his mother\u2019s artwork and his father\u2019s never-ending collection of books.</p>\n<p>\u201cHello!\u201d He says.</p>\n<p>\u201cDerek,\u201d his mother greets him with a hug. \u201cLaura and Cora ran up to put their things away before tea. But, where\u2019s your friend?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s coming,\u201d Derek replies, casting a nervous look towards the fireplace. Technically, Stiles should be coming through any moment.</p>\n<p>They wait for a moment. Derek frowns.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s Muggle-born,\u201d he says, chewing on his bottom lip. \u201cMaybe I should-\u201d</p>\n<p>The next instant, Stiles is bursting through the fireplace. He looks a little pale but otherwise fine.</p>\n<p>\u201cHello,\u201d Derek\u2019s mother says, smiling. \u201cFor a while there, we were afraid you had gone to the wrong place!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFirst time using the Floo Network?\u201d his father asks. \u201cIt can be a bit disorienting.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUm, yes,\u201d Stiles says, blushing. \u201cYes, first time. Um, hello.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMom and Dad,\u201d Derek says. \u201cThis is Stiles. Stiles, my parents.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHi,\u201d Stiles says again, dropping his bag without ceremony and stepping forward to shake each of their hands. Derek swears Stiles looked less nervous when staring down hippogriffs in Care for Magical Creatures. \u201cTh-thanks for having me. I hope it\u2019s not too much trouble. Seriously, you can just stick me on a couch somewhere. Or the floor. That works too.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek\u2019s mom laughs. Derek blushes. They have no less than\u00a0<em>three</em>\u00a0guest rooms.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe have a guest room all set up,\u201d she says. \u201cDerek can show you there now.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, that\u2019s really- wait,\u201d Stiles says, jumping a bit as he interrupts himself. \u201cWait, before I forget.\u201d</p>\n<p>His hands flutter for a second in the way they do when he is in a bit of a panic and he spins in place twice, apparently trying to look for his bag, then finds it.</p>\n<p>He frowns at it and his bag opens and then he mutters something and just as suddenly a pie is in his hand. Apparently, he\u2019s still too flustered to notice that both Derek\u2019s parents are staring at him in awe.</p>\n<p>Derek feels himself swell with pride for no reason. It\u2019s not like\u00a0<em>he</em>\u00a0is the one who can perform wandless magic without a second thought. But the amazed look on his parents\u2019 faces is how he thinks everyone should look at Stiles and even though he\u2019s gotten used to it, it really is incredible and-</p>\n<p>\u201cHere,\u201d Stiles says, holding out the tray to Derek\u2019s mother. \u201cIt\u2019s Pecan pie. Actually it\u2019s Bacon Bourbon Pecan pie. But, uh, it should be good. I think. We made three different versions to be sure.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>You</em>\u00a0made this?\u201d Derek\u2019s mom says. She sounds a little bit overwhelmed. Fair enough, Stiles is overwhelming. In all the best ways.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d Stiles says and he\u2019s turning red now. More red than Derek has ever seen him. \u201cWell, not just me. I mean, I had help so, really, it was more like half me? Or less. A quarter? I mean, not that I didn\u2019t help, I just-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cStiles is learning to cook from the elves at school,\u201d Derek cuts in. Stiles takes a breath and shoots Derek a grateful look. Derek nods.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat sounds wonderful,\u201d Derek\u2019s father says. \u201cAnd was that wandless magic I just saw?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, uh, yeah,\u201d Stiles says. \u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 that\u2019s how I do magic mostly. No one really knows why.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s incredibly rare,\u201d Derek\u2019s father says. He\u2019s sliding into his researcher voice. Derek is suddenly positive that he and Stiles are going to get along great. \u201cExcept for among elves, which I\u2019m sure you knew. In fact, I wonder if you harness magic the same way. That would be-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDear,\u201d Derek\u2019s mom interrupts. \u201cWhy don\u2019t we let Derek show our guest to his room before we start quizzing him.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, oh, yes, of course,\u201d Dad says. \u201cWe\u2019ll talk later.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThank you so much for the pie,\u201d his mom says, smiling. \u201cI put him in the guest room closest to yours, Derek.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek nods and pulls Stiles along and-</p>\n<p>\u201cGuest room closet to yours?\u201d Stiles asks under his breath as he grabs his bag. For all his skill with magic, sometimes it seems he forgets to use it. \u201cYou mean there\u2019s more than one?\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek flushes.</p>\n<p>And doesn\u2019t bother responding. Instead, he just opens the door to from the Floo Room to the main entryway of their house which is\u2026</p>\n<p>Well, it convey more than words exactly how big their house is. He\u2019s a Hale. It\u2019s more like a mansion. The opening room is a full double staircase and it\u2019s all warm woods and beams but it\u2019s still\u00a0<em>big</em>\u00a0and-</p>\n<p>\u201cHoly\u00a0<em>shit</em>,\u201d Stiles says. He\u2019s staring up at the ceiling. And at the back wall that\u2019s entirely windows. Half of which are stained glass. \u201cDerek, this is\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek shifts. He sort of hates this. Hates when people get awkward or think this is what his family is really about or-</p>\n<p>\u201cWell,\u201d Stiles says, clearing his throat so he doesn\u2019t sound quite so awed. \u201cI guess I won\u2019t be sleeping on a couch.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek relaxes. \u201cTold you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPsh,\u201d Stiles says. \u201cYou told me nothing. Are you secretly like Lord and Ladies? This is England. That\u2019s sort of the picture I have in my head.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek groans. Stiles grins at him.</p>\n<p>*^*^*^</p>\n<p>It\u2019s alarming how well Stiles fits into their family.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s a little awkward and nervous first and never quite stops rambling or tripping over his words but he still\u2026 he still\u00a0<em>fits</em>\u00a0somehow. He and Cora form a frankly terrifying alliance that seems to be dedicated to causing destruction and revealing Derek\u2019s most embarrassing moments. Laura remains a little bit distant at first but then Stiles mentions over dinner that he\u2019s teaching himself Geometry so he can help his friend, Scott, and Laura\u00a0<em>loves</em>\u00a0arthimancy and offers to help him and they take to spending at least an hour a day, crouched over books.</p>\n<p>And that\u2019s nothing compared to how much time Stiles spends talking to his parents. Derek\u2019s mother has always been fascinated with wandless magic and though Derek knows that Stiles usually sees it as more of a burden then a gift, he makes the effort to explain how he does it. Derek doesn\u2019t even know what Stiles and his dad end up talking about because it seems to be entirely theoretical (something about energy?) and entirely over Derek\u2019s head.</p>\n<p>And Derek can\u2019t get enough of living right next to him. Stiles takes ridiculously long showers and sings Muggle songs at the top of his lungs the entire time. He stays up way too late, muttering curses to himself, but Derek learns to falls asleep to the sound so it\u2019s not a big deal. (He doesn\u2019t quite manage to fall asleep to the explosions that sometimes happen, but that\u2019s okay. He likes the reminder that Stiles is there.)</p>\n<p>On the first day, they walk into town so that Stiles can use the internet and Derek has to admit that Muggle technology really is quite astounding. Stiles takes out his laptop and shows Derek the wonder of computers and typing and then he gets a phone call from his dad and it\u2019s not quite talking through a fire, but Stiles can see his father\u2019s\u00a0<em>face</em>\u00a0on the screen and-</p>\n<p>Well, Derek waves hello and then leaves to give him his privacy. Stiles takes to running over in the morning so he can talk to his father and Scott before they go to sleep.</p>\n<p>And then he\u2019s back and helping cook breakfast, no matter how many times each of the Hales tells him he\u2019s a guest and he doesn\u2019t have to cook.</p>\n<p>Christmas morning brings a subdued Stiles. He goes into town for a longer stretch of time than usual and comes back oddly quiet. But then he seems to realize that they\u2019ve waited for him to get back before opening presents and then he sees that he\u00a0<em>has</em>\u00a0presents from everyone (even Cora) and he gradually comes back to himself. By midday, he\u2019s alternating between laughing and stammering and blushing and-</p>\n<p>It\u2019s just all going by alarmingly quickly. And smoothly. Too smoothly.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s not even surprised when he wakes up the day they are due to return to Hogwarts to find his mom in the kitchen. Stiles must be out talking to his family one last time. His mother appears to be waiting for him.</p>\n<p>He knows what\u2019s coming, he just doesn\u2019t see a way to get out of it.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo,\u201d she says conversationally. \u201cAn American, muggle-born, Slytherin transfer. Who uses wandless magic without thinking about it.\u201d</p>\n<p>She pauses. Derek flushes. Then tries to hide it by turning and pretending that getting tea is a complicated process.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou sure know how to pick \u2018em,\u201d she says when Derek finally turns back around.</p>\n<p>Derek goes for arranging his face into something carefully blank. With a hint of a question.</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay, okay,\u201d his mother replies, standing regally. \u201cYou\u2019re too cool to talk about it with your mother. That\u2019s fine.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Mom</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut fair warning,\u201d she continues. \u201cLaura knows. So does Cora probably. So would half the people in your school if you let yourself hang out with him publically.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s not-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m just saying,\u201d she says. \u201cYour father and I think he\u2019s\u00a0<em>wonderful</em>. We totally approve.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMom, we\u2019re just\u00a0<em>friends</em>,\u201d Derek tries. \u201cReally.\u201d</p>\n<p>She raises an eyebrow at him. \u201cI thought I taught you better than to lie to your parents.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not lying,\u201d Derek says. \u201cI just\u2026 I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know what?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cJust\u2026 stuff,\u201d Derek says, shrugging and wondering if it\u2019s too late to just run away.</p>\n<p><br>\n\u201cYou don\u2019t know if you like him?\u201d his mother asks.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, I know- I mean,\u201d Derek takes a breath. \u201cIt\u2019s just more complicated at school. We don\u2019t\u2026 we don\u2019t get to see each other that much.\u201d</p>\n<p>His mom goes very still. Derek hunches his shoulders. He feel bad just for<em>saying</em>\u00a0that. But it\u2019s true. He and Stiles\u00a0<em>don\u2019t</em>\u00a0get to see each other every day at Hogwarts. They don\u2019t get to eat all their meals at the same table or stay up chatting over desserts or spend an entire day doing all the snow-related activities that Stiles had never gotten to do before.</p>\n<p>At Hogwarts, Stiles is still oddly careful when he says hello to Derek and starts rumors that Derek was\u00a0<em>forced</em>\u00a0to sit next to him in Potions and-</p>\n<p>\u201cDerek,\u201d his mother says, waiting until he looks up to meet his eyes. \u201cIf you want to spend time with him, then do it.\u201d</p>\n<p>She says it like it\u2019s easy. Like he doesn\u2019t have to concern himself with what his Housemates would say or worry Stiles getting bullied even more for being seen with him or consider that Stiles may not\u00a0<em>want</em>\u00a0to hang out with him.</p>\n<p>\u201cFrom what I\u2019ve seen,\u201d she continues. \u201cStiles doesn\u2019t seem to care about tradition or what people think or what people will say. But he does seem to care about you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course,\u201d she finishes, leaning forward and ruffling his hair. \u201cI might be a bit biased.\u201d</p>\n<p>*^*^*^</p>\n<p>He takes his mom\u2019s advice.</p>\n<p>He makes a point to arrive early to talk with Stiles before Potions class, and stands next to him during Care of Magical Creatures and invites Stiles over to sit with him and Boyd during Astronomy. He makes a point to hang around the classrooms of Stiles\u2019 other classes as they end so he can catch Stiles in conversation. He talks loudly and laughs openly and takes to yelling at anyone who says anything remotely negative about it.</p>\n<p>He gets two more detentions for fighting.</p>\n<p>Stiles scowls and calls him an idiot and tries to start a rumor that he is blackmailing Derek that absolutely no one believes.</p>\n<p>And the third time Derek winds up in Detention for punching a Ravenclaw because they imply that Stiles is cheating somehow, Stiles lights McGonagall\u2019s robes on fire and ends up cleaning bedpans with him.</p>\n<p>*^*^*^</p>\n<p>Still, Derek knows it\u2019s not really\u00a0<em>just</em>\u00a0for him, knows that Stiles prefer doing work outside rather than in the library, knows he shouldn\u2019t read into it too much, when Quidditch starts up again and Stiles takes to sitting on the bleachers when Gryffindor practices. He tells himself those things over and over again, but he still gets a thrill every time he looks over to see Stiles stretched out, scribbling furiously, curled in layers of clothes along the sideline.</p>\n<p>It causes a stir at first, since practices are supposed to be closed and a<em>Slytherin</em>\u00a0hanging around obviously can\u2019t be trusted. (Stiles doesn\u2019t help matters by merely shrugging and saying \u201cI could be\u201d when asked if he is spying.) But eventually Derek talks his team around. By which he means, he glares a lot, accuses them of cowardice, and assures them that if it looks like the other team has an advantage in the next game, he will be held personally responsible.</p>\n<p>Stiles receives a few more threats, which just make him grin, and then it\u2019s settled. Or at least, no one tries to physically remove him from the premises.</p>\n<p>His team really doesn\u2019t have anything to worry about though. For the most part, Stiles doesn\u2019t even seem to glance up.</p>\n<p>At least, he\u2019s never looking when Derek risks taking his eyes off the ball and looking down. (He only manages it about three times before missing a save and earning himself a talk from his captain.)</p>\n<p>Still, it\u2019s a good practice and when it ends, he doesn\u2019t hesitate to jump off his broom a little higher than necessary and land hard in front of Stiles.</p>\n<p>He gets a jump and gasp of surprise and he grins.</p>\n<p>\u201cHoly fucking-\u201d Stiles gasps. \u201cWarn a guy next time!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cC\u2019mon,\u201d Derek says. It\u2019s almost eight but it\u2019s still light out. \u201cIt\u2019s a beautiful day. Want to take a turn?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMuggle, remember?\u201d Stiles says, waving at his face.</p>\n<p>\u201cMuggle-born,\u201d Derek corrects, frowning. Stiles rolls his eyes.</p>\n<p>\u201cStill, I\u2019ve nearly killed myself playing\u00a0<em>lacrosse</em>,\u201d he says, shrugging one shoulder. \u201cAnd that is played on the ground. In protective gear.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, c\u2019mon,\u201d Derek says. \u201cYou\u2019ve been studying all day.\u201d</p>\n<p>With that, he reaches over and grabs Stiles\u2019 elbow, pulling him too his feet.</p>\n<p>\u201cDerek, no,\u201d he sputters. \u201cDude, I skipped first year! I didn\u2019t even get the Intro to Flying Crash Course!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll teach you,\u201d Derek says, continuing to march Stiles to the middle of the field. He doesn\u2019t feel bad about it. By this point he\u2019d learned the difference between Stiles\u2019 fake protests and his real ones. (Hint: His real protests usually end up with the other person on the ground.)</p>\n<p>\u201cAlright,\u201d Derek says once they\u2019re near the middle of the field. \u201cIt\u2019s not hard. Here, take the broom. Now, put one leg on either side, that\u2019s it- two hands, Stiles. Hold on with two hands and feel that? It\u2019s technically hovering. Now you just gotta hop up a bit. It\u2019ll catch you. Ready? 1-2-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWait!\u201d Stiles yelps suddenly. He\u2019d actually been obeying up to this point. \u201cWait, what the fuck? I\u2019m supposed to do this\u00a0<em>by myself?</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, yeah,\u201d Derek says, leaning back. \u201cHow else would you do it?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUh, I don\u2019t know!\u201d Stiles says, voice at least an octave higher than usual. \u201cWith another person! Or on some sort of safety broom! Or like a simulator of some kind. That\u2019s what I want. A broomstick simulator.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI have no idea what that is,\u201d Derek admits.</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course you don\u2019t,\u201d Stiles sighs. \u201cStill, there\u2019s no way. No way I\u2019m doing this. Uh-uh. I\u2019m out.\u201d</p>\n<p>He goes so far as to start stepping out of the broom.</p>\n<p>\u201cWait, wait, wait,\u201d Derek says. \u201cStiles, you can do this. Are you\u2026 are you afraid of heights or something?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Stiles says. \u201cBut I might be afraid of rocketing a thousand feet in the air and then falling to my\u00a0<em>death</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>He does sound a little panicked. Derek takes pity on him.</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay, okay,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ll go with you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIs this going to be like when people claim they are holding the bike but then they let go of the bike?\u201d Stiles asks, his eyes squinting in suspicion.</p>\n<p>\u201cSuch a bloody Slytherin,\u201d Derek says. \u201cJust trust me. Here, slide up so you can steer. And before you ask, yes, I can take over from back here.\u201d</p>\n<p>It\u2019s as Derek is throwing a leg over the broom that he realizes that in order to do this, he is going to have to hold on to Stiles. And that Stiles\u2019 back is going to be pressed against his chest. And that his face is basically going to be buried against Stiles\u2019 neck.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s okay. He can focus. He\u2019s a fucking Gryffindor. He\u2019s got this.</p>\n<p>(He\u2019s also been spending too much time with Stiles if he\u2019s cursing this much in his head, but that\u2019s not important at the moment.)</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay,\u201d he says, trying to keep his grip on Stiles\u2019 hips professional. \u201cOkay, now we jump on three, okay?\u201d</p>\n<p>Silently he says a prayer that the broom will hold them both.</p>\n<p>\u201cFuck,\u201d Stiles breathes.</p>\n<p>\u201c1\u20262\u20263!\u201d</p>\n<p>Despite it all, he\u2019s not really surprised when Stiles actually jumps. He jumps higher than Derek even and so for a moment Derek is afraid he\u2019s going to slide off the back but he grips Stiles\u2019 hips harder and then the broom seems to realize that there are two people on there and it straightens and-</p>\n<p>\u201cFucking shit, fucking shit, fucking shit,\u201d Stiles is muttering. Derek laughs.</p>\n<p>\u201cStiles, we\u2019re fine,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019re like six feet off the ground.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMore like twenty,\u201d Stiles mutters.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, stop being a baby,\u201d Derek says. \u201cNow lean forward a little bit so we can move.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles doesn\u2019t stop mumbling curses the whole time but he manages to listen anyway. And he\u2019s not bad. His movements are a bit spastic and a few times that means they are flying off faster than Derek would have suggested but Stiles seems to delight in going higher and higher and Derek delights in the feel of Stiles pressed against him and then has to try to\u00a0<em>stop</em>\u00a0delighting in it because \u2013uh-</p>\n<p>\u201cDude, we\u2019re so high,\u201d Stiles says as he pulls them to a stop high over the ground. \u201cThis is so cool.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Derek agrees, blinking and dragging his eyes away from Stile\u2019s neck. \u201cYeah, I\u2019m just glad it can hold both of us.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?!\u201d Stiles says. \u201cThis thing isn\u2019t meant for two people?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, I\u2019ve done it before,\u201d Derek replies, shrugging.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d Stiles calms. For a moment. Then, \u201cWait-\u00a0<em>when</em>\u00a0exactly did you do this?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhen I was learning to fly,\u201d Derek says seriously. Then laughs. \u201cWhen I was three.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh my\u00a0<em>god</em>,\u201d Stiles says but he\u2019s grinning. Derek can tell without being able to see his face. \u201cYou\u2019re the worst.\u201d</p>\n<p>They keep flying. Eventually Derek asks if Stiles would like to try it on his own and he senses Stiles\u2019 hesitation, feeling the muscles of his shoulders clench for just the briefest moment, and Derek doesn\u2019t really know what it means. But Stiles shakes his head a moment later, glancing back to reveal that his bottom lip is trapped between his teeth.</p>\n<p>\u201cNah,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s okay. It-uh- maybe next time.\u201d</p>\n<p>He\u2019s going for casual, Derek knows.</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Derek replies, keeping his voice equally light, even though he\u2019s sure he feels the same level of nerves. \u201cWanna try a barrel roll?\u201d</p>\n<p>Predictably, Stiles objects fervently to that idea.</p>\n<p>They do it anyway.</p>\n<p>*^*^*^</p>\n<p>It\u2019s the elves that warn him.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s late March and it seems that Stiles is almost always busy these days. He bursts into their Tuesday meetings late and spends large chunks of time staring into space and forcing Derek to repeat his instructions. He always looks happy to see Derek, but it\u2019s a muted happiness. A happiness tinged with exhaustion and stress and there\u2019s no real reason for it because it\u2019s not exam season.</p>\n<p>Even his magic seems worn out. Books that once rocketed from the shelves to meet up with Stiles\u2019 hand now sluggishly make their way across the room and most of the page turning is done by hand. One day, he actually gets out his<em>wand</em>\u00a0in order to enlarge a book to read it more easily.</p>\n<p>Derek isn\u2019t too worried. Stiles has been through stretches like this before. Maybe not as long, but every once and a while, there\u2019s a project that demands all his attention. Stiles is still there eating at lunch and he\u2019s making it to a fair amount of dinners. And he doesn\u2019t seem to mind when Derek sneaks him food in Potions and Care of Magical Creatures.</p>\n<p>Derek\u2019s going to give him a while longer before starting to freak out. Because he\u2019s also wearing himself a little thin. They\u2019d won their match against Ravenclaw, but lost narrowly to the Slytherins (Stiles had been good enough not to rub it in too much) which means that they have to beat the Hufflepuffs by a landslide. Otherwise Ravenclaw takes the cup. It means flying practice every day for Derek and lunch meetings to go over strategy and the kind of pressure that starts messing with his sleep. And the match is still weeks away.</p>\n<p>He\u2019ll calm down eventually, he knows, but until then, their study sessions have been a bit lackluster.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s one Tuesday when he and Stiles both fall asleep twenty minutes in and wake up at the sound of the warning bell groggy and embarrassed.</p>\n<p>(Derek learns that he looks ridiculous with the imprint of a book across his face and Stiles somehow still looks adorable even with one side of his hair plastered down.)</p>\n<p>He keeps falling asleep right after practice and falling behind on school work, so he starts waking up early to do it over breakfast. Or at least attempt.</p>\n<p>It here, early enough that he\u2019s the only Gryffindor at the table when there is suddenly a voice at his elbow.</p>\n<p>\u201cMister Hale!\u201d Derek jumps. He hadn\u2019t been sleeping. Just resting his eyes. \u201cDerek!\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek looks down to see a set of very familiar eyes looking back up at him.</p>\n<p>\u201cDaisy!\u201d he says and then immediately wakes up. \u201cWhat wrong?\u201d</p>\n<p>She tilts her head at him.</p>\n<p>\u201cNothing, but we were wondering what the plan was,\u201d she bounces up and down in excitement. Derek is very confused.</p>\n<p>\u201cPlan?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFor Mr. Stilinski\u2019s birthday!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBirthday?\u201d</p>\n<p>Daisy no longer looks excited. Now she looks like she is concerned she has the wrong human. She looks around and then back at him.</p>\n<p>\u201cMr. Stilinski,\u201d she repeats. \u201cStiles. Your friend. He brought you to the kitchens.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, I know who Stiles is, Daisy!\u201d Derek says, rubbing one hand across his face. Maybe this is some weird Transfiguration dream.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s his birthday,\u201d she says. \u201cOn the 8<sup>th</sup>\u00a0of April. In a week and a half.\u201d</p>\n<p>It should not be possible for such a tiny person to convey such a great amount of judgement.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe were wondering if you had a plan. Unless\u2026\u201d Her frown shifts. \u201cDo Americans not celebrate birthdays?\u201d She sounds horrified by the idea.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, they do,\u201d Derek says, things finally clicking into place. \u201cThey do, I just\u2026 I don\u2019t have a plan yet.\u201d</p>\n<p>He hadn\u2019t even known it was Stiles\u2019 birthday but he doesn\u2019t think admitting that is a particularly good idea.</p>\n<p>So that\u2019s how he ends up planning a surprise party for Stiles. It shouldn\u2019t be very hard since it\u2019s decided early on that Derek will just drag Stiles to the kitchens where the elves will have laid out his favorite foods and at least three different kinds of cakes, but it is. Because despite his repeated attempts to tell Harley that he doesn\u2019t\u00a0<em>know</em>\u00a0Stiles\u00a0<em>ultimate</em>\u00a0favorite food, the elf refuses to believe him. He is also called to consult on the exact shade of green that Stiles prefers and questioned on whether it is customary to wave an American flag at people\u2019s parties. Basically, it turns into a very extensive job.</p>\n<p>And on top of all of that, he has to get a present. Though, actually, he has one fire-chat with his Mom and that is apparently handled.</p>\n<p>It all goes off without a hitch.</p>\n<p>He notices that Stiles gets what looks like three cards and a small parcel delivered at breakfast and sort of waits all day for Stiles to casually mention that it\u2019s his birthday.</p>\n<p>But he doesn\u2019t and Derek is a little miffed at that, but in this case, it\u2019s for the best. And he manages not to give it away.</p>\n<p>Even the story that gets them both down in the kitchen is carefully constructed. Derek tells Stiles that Daisy came up to tell him that Harley isn\u2019t feeling well and Stiles instantly agrees that they should go down and say hello.</p>\n<p>His face when he opens the door is priceless.</p>\n<p>All the elves are screaming in excitement and Derek had not realized the three cakes they were planning were all\u00a0<em>tiered</em>\u00a0cakes and Stiles nearly\u00a0<em>kills</em>\u00a0himself laughing at the giant flag Daisy had insisted on draping along the back wall of the kitchen.</p>\n<p>The dinner stretches on for three hours, all the elves sitting around and talking over each other in a way that has become entirely peaceful. Stiles doesn\u2019t stop grinning and apparently the Hogwarts elf tradition of gifting socks is allowed to included Honorary Elves so he winds up with a pile of socks by his elbow.</p>\n<p>Gradually, the elves start to wander off to clean up or get some sleep or maybe Harley gives one of his unseen signals but eventually, it\u2019s just the two of them.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry I\u2019ve been so busy lately,\u201d Stiles says around a mouthful of cake. Derek doesn\u2019t have any idea how he\u2019s still eating. He thinks he\u2019s going to die. \u201cI\u2019ve just been trying a few things.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek wants to ask. Wants to, but doesn\u2019t because if Stiles wanted to tell him, he would have.</p>\n<p>And that\u2019s okay. He still looks happier than Derek has ever seen him.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s alright,\u201d he says honestly. \u201cI\u2019ve been busy with Quidditch too.\u201d</p>\n<p>He\u2019s just glad that the elves told him. That they could get together and celebrate Stiles\u2019 birthday.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd,\u201d he says, smiling a little. \u201cI think my present can help with that.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles stares at him.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he asks. \u201cYou- you got me another present? Besides the party?\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek really thinks that Stiles shouldn\u2019t be so amazed by that. Obviously he was getting Stiles a present. It\u2019s his birthday and he\u2019s Derek\u2026 well, he\u2019s Derek\u2019s best friend. Maybe more.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s from me and my sisters,\u201d he allows. \u201cAnd my parents.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDerek,\u201d Stiles says and he sounds suspicious. \u201cWhat did you do?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cEasier to show you, I reckon,\u201d Derek replies. The elves hadn\u2019t exactly been happy to keep Stiles\u2019 present in the back pantry of their kitchen but they\u2019d agreed. \u201cOne moment.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek can\u2019t help but be excited. He grabs the present, wincing a little at the sight of the godawful bow he had planted on top of it, but-</p>\n<p>He couldn\u2019t even categorize what Stiles\u2019 face does when he walks out with it.</p>\n<p>His eyes go big and his mouth drops open and he makes a high pitched sound that Derek has never heard come out of a human body before and-</p>\n<p>\u201cYou got me an\u00a0<em>owl</em>,\u201d Stiles squeaks. He stands and takes a cautious step forward as if afraid</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, you idiot,\u201d Derek says, rolling his eyes. The bird in the cage he\u2019s carrying is clearly not an owl. \u201cIt\u2019s a falcon. A Peregrine falcon.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles doesn\u2019t take his eyes from the falcon. Derek isn\u2019t sure how much he\u2019s actually processing. He continues anyway.</p>\n<p>\u201cThey\u2019re one of the fastest birds in the world,\u201d Derek says. \u201cHe\u2019s been trained like an owl though. And the trainer assured me that he\u2019s young enough that he\u2019ll bond with you and they\u2019re supposed to be super loyal and-. \u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles takes another small step closer.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d he says firmly. \u201cNo, I can\u2019t. Derek, this is\u2026 it\u2019s too much. I don\u2019t\u2026 I don\u2019t know how much falcons cost but falcons must cost\u2026 like a billion dollars. Like a fortune. Or a sizeable chunk of a fortune.\u201d</p>\n<p>Technically, Stiles isn\u2019t wrong. But Derek originally only asked for money to get Stiles his own owl and then his father had mentioned trying to get a falcon and his mother\u2019s friend\u2019s friend knew a guy and it was done before Derek really had a say in it.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s not important,\u201d Derek replies. \u201cWhat\u2019s important is that he\u2019s yours. Already bought and paid for. Though, my dad did really want to meet him at some point.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s\u2026 I can\u2019t, Derek. You have to tell them it\u2019s too much.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cStiles,\u201d Derek says. \u201cHe can get to California in almost half the time.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles goes very still. His hand sort of flutter once before clenching into fists and then he finally tears his eyes away from the bird. He reaches out very carefully to take the cage and then sets it on the counter and then-</p>\n<p>Then, Derek\u2019s arms are suddenly full of Stiles.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s the first time they\u2019ve ever hugged and he\u2019s too stunned to really react.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Thank you</em>,\u201d Stiles says, clinging, and eventually he pulls away but it takes a little while. He wipes at his eyes quickly and that\u2019s okay because Derek sort of has to swipe at his.</p>\n<p>By the time he looks over again, Stiles has broken Derek\u2019s promise to the elves to keep the \u201cbird of death\u201d in its cage and the falcon is already perched on his wrist.</p>\n<p>He stares at it for a solid minute in silence.</p>\n<p>\u201cAppa,\u201d he says finally.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s Derek\u2019s turn to blink.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHis name,\u201d Stiles says. \u201cHe shall be my powerful six-legged flying bison.\u201d Good lord, he\u2019s already crooning.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh my god, dude,\u201d Stiles groans. \u201cWe have to get you caught up on Muggle television. I am figuring out this electronics issue as my next project.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek rolls his eyes. At this point, the list of Muggle television that he is supposed to watch is entirely unmanageable.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe can\u2019t stay in the Owlery,\u201d Derek adds. \u201cHe won\u2019t get along with the owls, but I got McGonagall to say he could sleep in your dorm.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles looks delighted.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh my god!\u201d he says, pulling Appa closer and rubbing his face in the bird\u2019s chest. Derek is glad to see that the falcon looks taken with Stiles. At least he\u2019s not clawing his arm off. \u201cWe can totally snuggle all night, my beautiful air bending master of the sky.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek snorts. Appa twists his head to glare at him.</p>\n<p>\u201cDude, McGonagall must really love you,\u201d Stiles says. \u201cWhat did you do? Promise to kill if necessary win the Quidditch cup or something?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Derek says. \u201cI just told her it was a good idea. And that it would be no different from a student having a rat or a toad.\u201d</p>\n<p>And he\u2019d gone on a fairly lengthy speech about how it was still ridiculous that Stiles had to wait almost two weeks before hearing back from his family and how it was\u00a0<em>unacceptable</em>\u00a0that Stiles was ever put in that situation in the first place and how having Appa was essential to Stiles\u2019 happiness and-</p>\n<p>McGonagall had stopped him halfway through, right before he was going to threaten to get his parents involved (because he wasn\u2019t above playing that card if he had to) and told him that it was fine, that, as an international student, Stiles would be allowed to keep a falcon in his dorm as long as he kept it\u00a0<em>neat</em>and the bird didn\u2019t distract the other students.</p>\n<p>He and Stiles spend the next hour cooing over Appa and petting him and eventually a few of the elves are brave enough to come in and cautiously poke at him with in finger. Appa remains good natured about it even though Derek is sure that the trainer told him that falcons were notoriously temperamental.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s also pretty sure it\u2019s supposed to take birds longer to warm up to their owners but by the end of the night Appa is unashamedly nibbling gently on Stiles\u2019 ear and snaps at Derek when he gets too close. Which is very rude because he\u2019s lived with Derek for three days now and so Derek would appreciate some loyalty.</p>\n<p>Except not really. Because Stiles hasn\u2019t stopped grinning the whole time and he\u2019s already talking about how stoked Scott is going to be and the third time Appa snaps at Derek, Stiles pulls him up to eye level and gives him a very firm lecture on how Derek is awesome and, yes, he\u2019s a Gryffindor, but he\u2019s still cool.</p>\n<p>\u201cHappy Birthday, Stiles\u201d Derek says, smiling as they go to part ways. By this point, he doesn\u2019t need Stiles to walk him all the way back to the Gryffindor common room.</p>\n<p>\u201cThanks,\u201d Stiles says and then he\u2019s looking down and blushing a bit. \u201cIt really was a good one.\u201d</p>\n<p>His voice is soft, full of wonder and just a touch of true surprise.</p>\n<p>Derek nods and turns to leave and almost misses it the quiet continuation:</p>\n<p>\u201cMaybe the best.\u201d</p>\n<p>*^*^*^</p>\n<p>Derek gets pretty used to Appa dropping notes on his head. Usually, Appa is gone, clearly making the transatlantic journey back and forth with letters from Stiles\u2019 dad and Scott. But Stiles seems overly careful to give him at least a week to recover, or maybe it\u2019s just a week that Stiles gets to spend cuddling with him.</p>\n<p>Either way, there\u2019s usually a few days when Stiles seems to get a kick of sending Appa with letters to Derek even though, despite being busy, they manage to see each other in class three days a week and on Tuesday nights. And Appa seems to get a kick out of dropping Stiles\u2019 notes directly on Derek\u2019s face. And then refusing to move until Derek sends a return letter.</p>\n<p>Still, Derek isn\u2019t so happy when he wakes up from a perfectly pleasant dream with a piece of paper on his forehead. He\u2019s even less happy that it\u2019s not actually the piece of paper that wakes him up. It\u2019s a sizeable falcon jumping repeatedly on his chest.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhaaa-?\u201d Derek groans. Then recognizes the stupid bird. Then looks over to see that its freaking two o\u2019clock in the morning. \u201cOhmygod, no.\u201d</p>\n<p>He grabs the piece of paper and rolls over, perfectly content to leave it till morning. Just because Stiles seems unwilling to go to sleep at a reasonable hour does not mean that Derek doesn\u2019t get to sleep. He can read whatever random thought Stiles sent him in the morning. One time the message had been a tiny drawing of a stick-figure Derek.</p>\n<p>Appa keeps jumping on him.</p>\n<p>\u201cGo\u2019way,\u201d Derek mumbles, waving an arm at the stupid bird. He regrets ever getting Stiles the damned thing. \u201cI\u2019ll write back in the\u2019 mornin\u2019.\u201d</p>\n<p>Appa flies up for only a second, only enough to avoid Derek\u2019s arm and then he\u2019s latched onto Derek\u2019s wrist\u00a0<em>hard</em>\u00a0and flapping his wings and Derek gasps in surprise and pain and-</p>\n<p>The next second, Appa is\u00a0<em>screeching.</em></p>\n<p>\u201cShut up!\u201d Derek says, sitting up in an instant. He doesn\u2019t need the world waking up to see him getting attack by a falcon. And he and Stiles are going to have a very firm talk about appropriate times to send Appa along and maybe training Appa to not be so-</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m looking at it!\u201d He waves the piece of paper in front of Appa\u2019s face for good measure.</p>\n<p>Appa stops screeching but he doesn\u2019t let go of Derek\u2019s wrist.</p>\n<p>\u201cBloody hell,\u201d Derek mutters and then he\u2019s opening the note.</p>\n<p>And then he\u2019s flying out of bed because the note just says \u201cPotions\u201d in Stiles\u2019 unenhanced, awful handwriting and it looks extra shaky and there looks like there is\u00a0<em>blood</em>\u00a0at the corner of the page.</p>\n<p>He throws on trousers and the first shirt he can find (which, to be honest, he\u2019s not sure is his) and then all but sprints out of the dorm.</p>\n<p>He ignores the Fat Lady\u2019s protests at being swung open so harshly in the middle of the night and mentally shrugs at her threats to contact Professor McGonagall. And he ignores all the secret passages Stiles has shown him over the past four months and just takes the most direct route to the Potions classroom. At least it\u2019s late enough that most of the teachers who patrol the castle have given up.</p>\n<p>\u201cStiles!\u201d he all but yell as he bursts into the room. \u201cWhat\u2019s wron-\u201d</p>\n<p>He cuts himself off because it\u2019s clear in an instant what is wrong.</p>\n<p>Stiles is sitting on a table near the back, shirtless, and blood is running down his shoulder. No, not running. Pouring. Blood is pouring out of an open wound and it\u2019s clear he\u2019d tried to use his shirt to stop the bleeding. He doesn\u2019t look quite scared but Derek can see the relief in his eyes as Derek enters.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey,\u201d Stiles says, clearly going for casual even though his back is covered in<em>blood</em>. The bastard is even smiling a little. \u201cYou did okay on your Medical Charms exam, right?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat is\u2026 we are going to Madam Pomfrey!\u201d Derek says, recovering from his shock and rushing over. Stiles is still too thin in his opinion, but for once it works out because he can just carry Stiles up to the Hospital Wing. Or Levitate him. Yeah, that could also work. Or send Appa. \u201cC\u2019mon. You\u2019re-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo!\u201d Stiles gasps, leaning away from Derek and then groaning. \u201cNo, can\u2019t go there.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat are you\u00a0<em>talking</em>\u00a0about?\u201d Derek says. Up close, the wound looks even worse. It\u2019s like a bit of Stiles\u2019 shoulder is\u00a0<em>missing</em>. \u201cOf course, we can. We are!\u201d</p>\n<p>He wraps a hand around Stiles\u2019 uninjured arm and then snatches it back as if burned when Stiles\u00a0<em>flinches</em>\u00a0and, okay, carrying isn\u2019t going to be an option. He\u2019s sending Appa.</p>\n<p>\u201cDerek,\u201d Stiles says. \u201cYou need to calm down.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek can\u2019t really say exactly what his face does at that statement. He knows it can\u2019t be good.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe cannot go to Madam Pomfrey,\u201d Stiles says, still talking as if\u00a0<em>Derek</em>\u00a0is the crazy one. \u201cBecause I know these injuries seem strange. But they are actually pretty easy to identify. If you know what to look for.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek flicks his eyes back to Stiles\u2019 shoulder. Maybe it\u2019s actually some type of burn? He doesn\u2019t know. He can\u2019t-</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd,\u201d Stiles continues. \u201cIf Hogwarts finds out what I\u2019m up to, I\u2019ll definitely be expelled.\u201d He grins. \u201cYou don\u2019t want that, do you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMaybe you\u00a0<em>should</em>\u00a0be expelled,\u201d Derek mutters but he stops trying to get Appa\u2019s attention.</p>\n<p>Stiles laughs and then groans. \u201cDoubtless.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Derek says and forces himself to take a breath. To calm down. \u201cAs long as we agree on that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDefinitely,\u201d Stiles says. \u201cNow come here.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek wishes he could say that Stiles\u2019 apparent extensive knowledge of First Aid Magic makes him feel better about the situation. But it doesn\u2019t. Because it just makes it more obvious that Stiles had expected something like this to happen and, more than once, he mutters how if it wasn\u2019t his\u00a0<em>wand</em>\u00a0arm and he could see it properly, he could have totally handled this himself. Which is stupid. Stiles shouldn\u2019t be handling this himself.</p>\n<p>In the end, it takes three different spells to get Stiles\u2019 shoulder to stop bleeding. And then another spell to Summon bandages (luckily Stiles is able to pull that one off because Derek still needs to be able to see things in order to Summon them). And then Stiles thinks Derek should just wrap the bandages naturally, but a lifetime of Quidditch has taught Derek the proper spell to wrap a wound and so-</p>\n<p>All told, it\u2019s only twenty minutes before Stiles\u2019 arm is wrapped up and Derek stops worrying that Stiles is going to bleed to death. Stiles still looks pale though. And he\u2019s still breathing shallowly and sweating. And he\u2019s still sitting and Derek hasn\u2019t yet removed his hand.</p>\n<p>\u201cStiles,\u201d Derek says, hand tightening on Stiles\u2019 good shoulder. \u201cWhat were you<em>doing</em>?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI- I can\u2019t tell you,\u201d Stiles replies softly. He sounds sorry, but firm. \u201cBut don\u2019t worry. I know it doesn\u2019t look it, but this is actually the easy part.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe\u00a0<em>easy</em>\u00a0part?\u201d Derek says, his voice rising. \u201cThe\u00a0<em>easy</em>\u00a0part? Stiles, a chunk of your\u00a0<em>shoulder</em>\u00a0is just bloody gone!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay, yes,\u201d Stiles says. \u201cFrom an outsider\u2019s perspective, this would appear to be the hard part. But seriously. It\u2019s not. And I figured out what I did wrong, so it\u2019s not going to happen again.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIf you knew what you were doing, it would have happened in the\u00a0<em>first</em>\u00a0place,\u201d Derek snaps.</p>\n<p>\u201cI may have been rushing just a little bit,\u201d Stiles admits. \u201cBut, Derek, I\u2019m\u2026 I\u2019m so\u00a0<em>close</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cStiles,\u201d Derek says. \u201cWhatever it is, it\u2019s not worth it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles doesn\u2019t bother saying anything. It doesn\u2019t matter. Derek can see the disagreement all over his face. He shakes his head but doesn\u2019t say anything more as Stiles snatches his wand and Banishes the pile of bloody clothes somewhere.</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d Stiles says, standing with a silent gasp of pain. There is still dried blood soaking the back of his trousers. He takes a few shallow breathes and then turns to Derek. \u201cI\u2019m almost done.\u201d</p>\n<p>He limps out slowly and Derek watches him.</p>\n<p>He just wishes he knew what Stiles was talking about.</p>\n<p>*^*^*^</p>\n<p>After that, Derek vows to keep a closer eye on Stiles. He\u2019s going to bring meals to\u00a0<em>every</em>\u00a0Tuesday study session and sit next to him during all the classes they have together, and after Quidditch practice, he will simply wander the castle until he finds him. And make sure he\u2019s still alive.</p>\n<p>His plan fails.</p>\n<p>Stiles\u00a0<em>cancels</em>\u00a0their next Tuesday session, sending Appa with a cryptically short message. Sitting next to him in class doesn\u2019t do any good because Stiles spends the entirety of the time scribbling in his notebook. He doesn\u2019t even pretend to pay attention.</p>\n<p>And the one time Derek wanders the castle, he ends up roaming for two\u00a0<em>hours</em>muttering about stupid, sneaky, stubborn Slytherins before accepting defeat. He doesn\u2019t try again. If Stiles doesn\u2019t want to be found, he won\u2019t be.</p>\n<p>By the time Saturday rolls around, Derek is so nervous and fed up that he can\u2019t even get excited about the Ravenclaw/Slytherin Quidditch game.</p>\n<p>He goes, of course, because the whole team goes to see if they will even have a chance at winning the Cup, but after twenty minutes, Derek realizes that all he\u2019s doing is scanning the Slytherin side of the stadium for Stiles. And Stiles doesn\u2019t\u2019 seem to be there.</p>\n<p>He leaves. It\u2019s the first Quidditch game he\u2019s not watching in his entire Hogwarts career.</p>\n<p>He has every intention of going to the Owlery and sending Stiles a message. He\u2019s not sure what it will say yet, but Twinkles will be able to find him and Derek just needs to at least\u00a0<em>talk</em>\u00a0to him.</p>\n<p>But then on his way up to the Owlery, he hears something.</p>\n<p>A laugh.</p>\n<p>A loud, joyful,\u00a0<em>incredible</em>\u00a0laugh.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s coming from a nearby empty classroom \u2013 McGonagall\u2019s classroom actually - and Derek frowns because he swears, it sounds similar to Stiles\u2019, but\u2026</p>\n<p>But Stiles has never sounded like\u00a0<em>that</em>\u00a0before. Not even when he\u2019s surrounded by elves all yelling at him for not visiting for three whole weeks.</p>\n<p>Derek freezes, still struggling to imagine that Stiles could ever sound like that and half convinced it must be someone else, when-</p>\n<p>\u201cDude!\u201d Definitely Stiles. \u201cDude, I think someone\u2019s coming.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHoly shit!\u201d The voice sounds giddy rather than truly concerned. Derek doesn\u2019t recognize it.</p>\n<p>\u201cHide!\u201d Stiles whispers.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhere?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI dunno! Uh-\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek swings the door open.</p>\n<p>He finds Stiles standing in front of the desk, clearly trying to push another boy<em>behind</em>\u00a0the desk but the other boy seems to be too busy giggling to bother bending over enough and-</p>\n<p>\u201cStiles?\u201d Derek asks, frowning. He doesn\u2019t\u2026 what\u2019s happening?</p>\n<p>Stiles grabs the boy by his robes and stands him up straight.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey!\u201d Stiles says, smiling a bit too broadly. Then, \u201cDerek!\u201d</p>\n<p>He sounds thrilled. Thrilled and maybe a little relieved. The boy next to him shoves his elbow into Stiles\u2019 side.</p>\n<p>\u201cDerek,\u201d Stiles says, yelping away from the elbow and taking a moment to glare at his friend. \u201cYou\u2019ve met\u2026 Stanley, right? From Hufflepuff?\u201d</p>\n<p>The boy next to Stiles is indeed wearing a yellow and black tie and is nodding next to Stiles, grinning hopefully, and Derek is positive he\u2019s never seen him before in his life.</p>\n<p>\u201cUh,\u201d he says.</p>\n<p>\u201cWait,\u201d the kid says and, just like that, he smile broadens to include Derek as well. \u201cHold up. This is\u00a0<em>Derek</em>?\u201d</p>\n<p>His accent is American.\u00a0<em>He\u2019s</em>\u00a0American. He\u2019s\u2026</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Scott?</em>\u201d Derek gasps. Stiles groans.</p>\n<p>\u201cDude!\u201d Stiles says, shoving Scott over even as he bursts into laughter. It\u2019s the special kind of laughter again. The kind that Derek could die happy listening to. \u201cYou were supposed to be practicing your British accent.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d Scott says. \u201cI forgot!\u201d</p>\n<p>The two dissolve into bickering that involves too many grins and playful punches to be anything other than completely ecstatic and Derek feel like his brain is melting.</p>\n<p>It should not be possible. For Scott to be here. It is 100%\u00a0<em>impossible</em>\u00a0and yet here he is. Standing in McGonagall\u2019s classroom. Wearing robes and a Hufflepuff tie. A Muggle. In Hogwarts. On a random Saturday in April.</p>\n<p>\u201cStiles,\u201d he starts when both boys stop talking to grin at each other. \u201cStiles, what did you do?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d Stiles says, shrugging. \u201cI figured out a way to get Scott here.\u201d</p>\n<p>That turns out to be the greatest understatement in history.</p>\n<p>Because, first and foremost, \u201cgetting Scott here\u201d meant learning how to Apparate. Illegally. Over international borders. And then learning how to do it with a passenger which most people did not do until they were well into their twenties. And it turns out that that\u2019s what Stiles had been doing when he was injured. He wasn\u2019t injured. He was partially\u00a0<em>splinched.</em></p>\n<p><em>\u201cAnd I threw up for like two days afterwards</em>,<em>\u201d Stiles admits with a shrug. \u201cIt was fucking gross, dude.</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cBro,\u201d Scott says, frowning. Stiles rolls his eyes and conjures water from nowhere to pour over Scott\u2019s head. The story is held up for a brief amount of time for an impromptu wrestling match.</em>\n</p>\n<p>And that\u2019s just the tip of the iceberg. Because Stiles frowns and explains that not even he could figure out a way to get around Hogwarts\u2019 anti-Apparition Security Wall, so he was forced to find secret passages out of the school. Most of which had been locked up after the War, but Stiles rolls his eyes when Derek mentions that and insists that there\u2019s always a way.</p>\n<p>Scott catches Derek\u2019s eye and shrugs apologetically.</p>\n<p>But, then, the greatest achievement of Stiles\u2019 (and the one he downplays the most) is somehow tricking Hogwarts into thinking that Scott is a Wizard. Because Hogwarts it supposed to be\u00a0<em>invisible</em>\u00a0to a Muggle (or at least, entirely unremarkable) and so Scott shouldn\u2019t be able to see anything. He should get the irresistible urge to go be with his family or check his gas meter or balance his checkbook the moment he gets too close.</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cAh, that was a bit tricky,\u201d Stiles admits. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit of essence trading and camouflaging and, actually, the Patronus Charm was really helpful once I tweaked it a bit.\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cWas that the puppy thing you did?\u201d Scott asks. \u201cI liked that puppy.\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cOf course, you liked the puppy,\u201d Stiles says. \u201cIt was literally your aura in corporeal form!\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cMy aura is very cute.\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>The conversation quickly derails from there and Stiles seems completely uninterested in explained exactly how he got past Hogwarts\u2019\u00a0<em>ancient</em>\u00a0security systems. He seems even less interested in hearing Derek\u2019s repeated assertions that the magic he\u2019s invented is\u00a0<em>incredible</em>.</p>\n<p>Stiles seems to only be concerned with marveling with how easy it was to sneak Scott in with everyone at the Quidditch game and filling Scott in on all the crazy drama while giving him a tour of Hogwarts. In turn, Scott tells Stiles all about Beacon Hills, a girl named Allison and Stiles\u2019 dad and his mother and-</p>\n<p><em>\u201cDude, you\u2019re going to have to see when you get home for the summer, but I think\u2026 I think they\u2019re like\u2026\u00a0</em>together<em>.\u201d</em></p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cMy dad? Your mom?\u201d Stiles sounds a mixture of horrified and delighted. \u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 no way!\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p><em>\u201cI\u2019m just saying,\u201d Scott says. \u201cThey sit and talk for a\u00a0</em>long time<em>\u00a0after dinner ends. Like\u2026 I have gone to bed with them still talking.\u201d</em></p>\n<p>There are a few times when Derek offers to leave but both boys glare at him and then Scott focuses and is asking him a million questions and any that Derek stumbles over,\u00a0<em>Stiles</em>\u00a0somehow knows the answers. Scott gets to hear all about his sisters and Christmas and Derek\u2019s Keeper position on Quidditch and-</p>\n<p>\u201cFlying must be awesome!\u201d Scott says as Derek finishes briefly explaining the rules. Derek has completely lost track of how much time has passed. All he knows is that it\u2019s dark out. They\u2019re camped out in Stiles\u2019 and his usual study spot because they know no one is going to be in the library after a Quidditch match.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, you can totally try if you want to,\u201d Derek says. \u201cIt\u2019s dark enough that no one but us will see you. And even if they do, the field is too far away from the castle anyway.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDude,\u201d Scott says. \u201cReally?\u201d</p>\n<p>He sounds amazed. Stiles looks like Derek just gave him another falcon.</p>\n<p>Derek blushes, but he\u2019s smiling.</p>\n<p>*^*^*^</p>\n<p>Unlike Stiles, Scott shows absolutely no fear at the thought of flying by himself. He practically bursts with excitement when Stiles assures him that the spell he created to make Scott seem like a magic-user should work with broomsticks as well and the next moment is he straddling Derek\u2019s broomstick and kicking off and-</p>\n<p>Stiles and Derek settle back on the bleachers to watch. Derek is half-afraid Scott is going to kill himself but Stiles seems all too happy to throw out ridiculous challenges and then laughs as Scott struggles to complete them. Derek is just content to sit and flick his eyes between the two of them. Because he wants to be ready if Scott falls, but he also wants to capture every moment of joy on Stiles\u2019 face.</p>\n<p>\u201cThanks,\u201d Stiles says suddenly as they watch Scott slowly lift higher and higher in the air. \u201cFor this. It\u2019s probably the only sport in the world that you can do even if you have asthma.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSure,\u201d Derek says. It\u2019s not a problem. He just can\u2019t believe Stiles somehow managed all this.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd,\u201d Stiles hesitates, squirming a little on the seat. \u201cAnd for everything, really. Just\u2026 thank you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek has never heard Stiles sound so sincere and then, his face stays pointed up towards Scott, but suddenly his hand is sitting\u00a0<em>on top</em>\u00a0of Derek\u2019s and it\u2019s very, very warm out even though it isn\u2019t and-</p>\n<p>\u201cNo problem,\u201d he manages to croak.</p>\n<p>Stiles\u2019 hand doesn\u2019t leave until Scott lands.</p>\n<p>And it gives Derek\u2019s a little squeeze before it moves.</p>\n<p>*^*^*^</p>\n<p>Derek is pretty sure he was Sorted into the wrong house.</p>\n<p>Because after the handholding and the smiling and Scott wrapping him in a hug before leaving and whispering \u201cGo get him, buddy,\u201d a brave person would make a move.</p>\n<p>A brave person would ask Stiles on a date to Hogsmeade properly or would reach out to grab his hand again as they walk through the halls or would try just pulling Stiles in by the shoulders and kissing him and seeing what happens from there.</p>\n<p>A brave person would at least stop\u00a0<em>blushing</em>\u00a0ridiculously whenever they make eye contact that goes on a beat too long.</p>\n<p>But Derek does none of those things. No, instead he just keeps stealing glances at Stiles and jumping whenever Stiles arranges it so their legs brush underneath their study table and stammering when Laura and Cora ask him how things with him and Stiles are\u00a0<em>going</em>.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s not a brave person. He belongs to the wrong House.</p>\n<p>Maybe there\u2019s a secret fifth House whose traits are nervousness, second-guessing, and cursing themselves in their heads. Maybe that\u2019s the House he belongs too.</p>\n<p>And, really, this should\u00a0<em>not</em>\u00a0be that hard. He is like\u2026 95% certain that Stiles wants Derek to kiss him. The looks are getting longer and Stiles\u2019 mouth keeps quirking into that little half smile that Derek has never seen him give anyone else, not even Scott, and every once and a while his eyes dance downward to Derek\u2019s mouth. Just for a moment.</p>\n<p>Unless it\u2019s all in his head and Derek is just making it up and maybe friends squeeze each other\u2019s hands all the time and-</p>\n<p>It builds for another two weeks before Derek can\u2019t take it anymore.</p>\n<p>He can\u2019t. He\u2019s going crazy. He\u2019d missed an\u00a0<em>entire</em>\u00a0Charms class because he\u2019d been daydreaming about Stiles\u2019 collarbones and he-</p>\n<p>He walks out of History of Magic early. He doesn\u2019t care if Professor Binns notices. He suspects he doesn\u2019t.</p>\n<p>He walks out and marches himself so he\u2019s outside Stiles\u2019 Herbology class. He\u2019s a Gryffindor. He can do this.</p>\n<p>The Ravenclaws and other Slytherins glance at him but his face must look some degree of determined because aside from a few raised eyebrows and some giggles, no one dares to say hello to him.</p>\n<p>Stiles comes out towards the end of the pack.</p>\n<p>\u201cI need to talk to you,\u201d Derek says roughly. \u201cRight now.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWha-why?\u201d Stiles says, but he doesn\u2019t protest as Derek wraps a hand around Stiles\u2019 arm and starts pulling him towards the nearest empty room. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek doesn\u2019t bother answering. He opens one door to find it full of 1<sup>st</sup>\u00a0year Gryffindors. He thinks Cora gasps his name but he doesn\u2019t wait around to say hello.</p>\n<p>\u201cSeriously, dude,\u201d Stiles says and he sounds worried. \u201cIs it something with your sisters? Or that Collins kid again? Because I swear, this time-\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek shakes his head and tries another door and-</p>\n<p>Okay, it turns out the nearest empty room is a broom closet. That\u2019s fine. He yanks Stiles in and slams it shut. Luckily a torch comes on automatically. Stiles is still staring. Then he looks around, squinting in confusion.</p>\n<p>\u201cI am a\u00a0<em>Gryffindor</em>,\u201d Derek tells him. Or maybe himself. Stiles nods. Slowly.</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay?\u201d Stiles says it like a question. Like he hasn\u2019t figured out what\u2019s going on quite yet.</p>\n<p>It makes sense. Stiles\u2019 brain is always going toward analyzing disasters. He\u2019s probably still convinced that Derek is in some sort of trouble.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat means I\u2019m the brave one,\u201d Derek says, and his voice is lower than usual for some reason. \u201cI\u2019m the brave one and I do brave things.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek watches as Stiles starts to get it. He blinks once and then his face slides into that small half smile and-</p>\n<p>Derek can\u2019t wait another moment.</p>\n<p>He grabs Stiles by the robes and pulls him in and plants his lips on Stiles\u2019.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s not exactly coordinated and Derek thinks that maybe he should have calmed down and done it slower because it seems a bit forceful but he can\u2019t bring himself to back off now because Stiles\u2019 lips are\u00a0<em>on his own</em>\u00a0and\u00a0<em>this is happening</em>\u00a0and\u00a0<em>holy shit, holy shit.</em></p>\n<p>\n<em>\u00a0</em>\n</p>\n<p>He thinks Stiles is kissing back. But he can\u2019t really tell because his grip is still too strong around Stiles robes and he\u2019s holding his breath and- crap, Stiles is pulling away and-</p>\n<p>\u201cSorry,\u201d Derek says immediately. That was too rough. Too forceful. Crap, he did that all wrong and, wait, are they in a\u00a0<em>broom closet?</em>\u00a0\u201cSorry, I- uh-\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles is\u00a0<em>smirking\u00a0</em>at him.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou may be brave,\u201d he says and Derek is having trouble focusing because Stiles\u2019 lips look a little bit swollen. And kissable. Still so bloody kissable. \u201cBut I\u2019m a Slytherin. That means I\u2019m the clever one.\u201d</p>\n<p>And then Stiles is pulling Derek in again, but this time his hands go\u00a0<em>under</em>Derek\u2019s robes to slide up against his neck and his lips are capturing Derek\u2019s before prying them open and then his tongue is sliding against Derek\u2019s and his fingers are tangled in Derek\u2019s hair and-</p>\n<p>\n<em>Oh, okay.</em>\n</p>\n<p>He was wrong about everything.</p>\n<p>Cleverness definitely trumps bravery.</p>\n<p>*^*^*^</p>\n<p>Derek somehow gets even more detentions after that.</p>\n<p>They get detentions for snogging in various empty classrooms (some of which turn out to be not so empty) and they get detentions for being out past curfew and Derek gets another detention for punching Collins\u00a0<em>again</em>\u00a0and-</p>\n<p>Well, Laura keeps trying to lecture him on\u00a0<em>propriety</em>\u00a0and\u00a0<em>basic decency</em>\u00a0and even Cora expresses her horror and finding out her brother was found practically naked in the Astronomy Tower in the middle of the day.</p>\n<p>(For the record, they were not \u201cpractically naked.\u201d They were just missing shirts. Totally different.)</p>\n<p>Stiles lives up to all his Slytherin traits. He lies to teachers constantly to get Derek out of class and into shady corners. He\u2019s exceedingly ambitious when it comes to how much snogging he assumes they can do in a day and how loud he can get Derek to moan before someone notices. And the resourcefulness\u2026 it\u2019s frankly a little alarming how Stiles manages to make the best of out any situation.</p>\n<p>And, for the record, Stiles\u2019 ability to use wandless magic is just downright unfair. Derek considers himself brave just for going along with it.</p>\n<p>They also discover that Stiles\u2019 control sort of\u2026\u00a0<em>slips</em>\u00a0when he gets too excited. The first time it happens, Derek thinks that the books just happen to slide off of the library shelf and it only takes a moment for Stiles to frown and banish them back, but then a stool in Flitwick\u2019s classroom\u00a0<em>explodes</em>\u00a0and\u2026</p>\n<p>Well, they both end up in Madam Pomfrey\u2019s with unexplained second degree burns the first time Derek tries to go down on Stiles.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s alarming how little that stops them from trying. Stiles claims that he has to learn control eventually and Derek notes that there\u2019s no point in magical medicine if you don\u2019t use it and-</p>\n<p>They get a very long and awkward lecture from McGonagall the next time it happens.</p>\n<p>In the end, the last month and a half of school go by too quickly. It\u2019s over before he even knows to worry about it ending.</p>\n<p>School is ending and that means Stiles is flying home for the summer and that\u2019s almost\u00a0<em>three months</em>\u00a0before Derek can see him again.</p>\n<p>\u201cI could totally pop over and visit,\u201d Stiles says for the thousandth time as they stand on the train station. Stiles is heading back to King\u2019s Cross before taking the tube to Heathrow and then home. Derek is just using the Floo network. \u201cJust send me a detailed map of where your house actually\u00a0<em>is</em>\u00a0and-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Derek grumbles, also for the thousandth time. \u201cIt\u2019s too risky. You\u00a0<em>don\u2019t</em>really know where my house is and you could end up splinched again.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI got splinched\u00a0<em>once</em>,\u201d Stiles mutters. \u201cAnd only a little!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>And</em>,\u201d Derek continues as if Stiles hadn\u2019t spoken. \u201cAnd you have to save your illegal Apparating for when you need to get Scott to Hogwarts.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI told you,\u201d Stiles says. \u201cI\u2019m totally setting up a Portkey next year. I\u2019ve already started doing the research!\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek rolls his eyes. Stiles may have managed to get past the international apparition borders but the security on Portkeys was ridiculous since the war. There was no way-</p>\n<p>\u201cStiles, it\u2019s three months,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s nothing.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re the worst,\u201d Stiles sighs. \u201cIt\u2019s like you hate me.\u201d Derek laughs. Because they both know that\u2019s not true. They haven\u2019t quite said the \u201cL\u201d word yet because they\u2019re barely fifteen and it had seemed to soon but Derek is positive they feel it. Maybe he\u2019ll manage to make that moment more romantic then grabbing Stiles and throwing him in a broom closet.</p>\n<p>So Derek settles for kissing him. He\u2019s gotten better since their first kiss. Stiles practically melts into his side. Or maybe he melts into Stiles\u2019. He can\u2019t tell anymore.</p>\n<p>\u201cAlright, train,\u201d he says, leaning back and regretting it already. The conductor already called for the students to board ten minutes ago. \u201cGo.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo demanding,\u201d Stiles mutters, but he grabs his bag (still just the one duffel that has the check-mark on the side) and Appa\u2019s cage.</p>\n<p>\u201cWill you run after the train?\u201d Stiles asks, one foot on the step.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Derek says. \u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIf you were at all romantic, you\u2019d run after the train,\u201d Stiles tells him. Derek shoves him inside.</p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t run after the train. He does stare at it for a while though before heading back though.</p>\n<p>He stares at it for too long. It\u2019s embarrassing.</p>\n<p>But eventually he gets back to the Great Hall and takes the Floo Network home and when he gets there, he finds Appa waiting for him.</p>\n<p>I CAN\u2019T BELIEVE YOU DIDN\u2019T RUN AFTER THE TRAIN, the letter reads. I WILL NEVER FORGIVE YOU FOR THIS. I HATE YOU.</p>\n<p>ALSO, I MISS YOU.</p>\n<p>ALSO, COULD YOU SEND HIM BACK WITH MY WAND? I THINK I BANISHED IT TO YOUR BAG INSTEAD OF MINE.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0End.</p>"
