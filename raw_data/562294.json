  "text": "<p>Derek woke up on a Thursday morning, just after dawn, with a gold band on his left hand and Stiles tucked up under his arm. He had about thirty seconds to lie there, reeling in confusion before Stiles stirred too, blinking awake. </p>\n<p>\u201cHoly shit,\u201d he said, jerking out from under Derek\u2019s arm, sitting up in a rumpled mess. \u201cWhat the hell?\u201d</p>\n<p>The air was cold where Stiles was disturbing the covers, so Derek yanked the blankets closer, burrowing in. </p>\n<p>\u201cHow did we get here?\u201d Stiles said, voice verging on hysterical. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on? Derek, pay attention. Were we drugged? Why aren\u2019t you freaking out? Did you do this? Did you kidnap me?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d Derek said. \u201cI kidnapped you as part of my nefarious plan to murder you by letting you drool on me.\u201d He should be freaking out, he knew it, but this bed was pretty comfortable, and Stiles seemed to be doing well for both of them. </p>\n<p>\u201cShut up,\u201d Stiles said, flushing. He looked around. \u201cWhere are we?\u201d Derek didn\u2019t know, so he didn\u2019t answer. Stiles threw up his hands, and shoved off the bed, crossing to the window. \u201cOkay, still Beacon Hills,\u201d he said, peering at the street sign. \u201cOver by the school.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Derek said, and contemplated going back to sleep. </p>\n<p>There were strange creaking noises, however, so Derek cracked an eye open again to find Stiles across the room, looking in drawers. \u201cThese are my socks,\u201d he announced. </p>\n<p>\u201cGood find,\u201d Derek said. </p>\n<p>\u201cThey\u2019re touching your socks,\u201d Stiles said, like it clarified his objection. \u201cWhy would someone go through the trouble of moving our socks? Oh my God, are you going back to sleep? Why are you going back to sleep?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t have a job,\u201d Derek said, unbothered. \u201cWhy not?\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cFuck,\u201d Stiles said. \u201cWork!\u201d He flew around the room, pulling random drawers open, muttering angrily as he located his clothes. He was gone in a hurry, and Derek listened as the Jeep roared out of the driveway. He dozed for a little while longer, then rolled out from the covers. Stiles had been correct, their clothes were all here, and mixed together. It smelled right, though, in a way that was hard for him to explain. Everything smelled right, like it had been that way for years, like there had been time for Derek\u2019s scent to soak into everything, like this was home. </p>\n<p>It was powerful magic, whatever it was. </p>\n<p>Derek wandered the house. There were pictures on the wall, pictures of the betas, of Scott, of Jackson and Lydia, of the Sheriff with his arms tight around Melissa McCall. There were strangers too, people Derek only vaguely knew as friends of Stiles. And there was were pictures of them. Derek with his arms around Stiles on the beach, picking him up over his shoulder, clearly about to throw him in the surf. Stiles, mugging and holding up devil\u2019s horns behind Derek\u2019s head at what looked like a diner. A candid, the two of them laughing in front of a campfire. There was a life splayed out here, and he stopped to trace over one in a large frame, just the two of them, in tuxes. Their faces were happy, and he stared at the smile on his own face. It was their wedding, he could tell. He ran his finger over the gold band on his finger, the surface warmed by his own body heat. </p>\n<p>He went outside and looked at the house. It was red, with a neat driveway and big windows. It looked nothing like his parents\u2019 house, but he supposed it was pretty nice. He made the rounds of it. There was a stair broken in the back, and he thought how strange it was for those little details to exist in this--whatever it was that was going on. </p>\n<p>He went into the kitchen. There wasn\u2019t much in the cupboards or fridge to eat so he made himself a sandwich from the odds and ends he could find, and then went out. There was a grocery store he liked to go to on the opposite side of town, that was less crowded and terrifying than the supermarket downtown. He wandered through the aisle, grabbing random things off shelves. He guessed at things Stiles might eat, and then brought everything to the register. </p>\n<p>\u201cMorning, Derek,\u201d the cashier said cheerfully. \u201cHow\u2019s everything?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGood,\u201d Derek said automatically, hands tightening on the edge of the counter. He had never talked to her before, but he had seen her nearly every time he came in. \u201cHow are you?\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cWell,\u201d she said, and launched into a story about her grandchildren, as if this was a topic they regularly discussed. He nodded at intervals, watching as she waved his items in the air as she talked. He belatedly realized she had hit the punchline of the story, and laughed, just a beat too late. \u201cEverything okay?\u201d she said, narrowing her eyes at him. </p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd Stiles too?\u201d </p>\n<p>He coughed uncomfortably. \u201cI guess,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s at work.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh honey,\u201d she said, and patted his hand. \u201cDon\u2019t you fret too much if you\u2019re having problems. Marriage is tough work. Jim and I have been married forty years, and we still fight all the time.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cThanks, June,\u201d he said, and paid his bill. He realized when he got back to the house, that she had snuck a candy bar in the bag. He ate it slowly, savoring each bite.</p>\n<p>He started going through the house more closely in the afternoon. There was a room that was clearly an office, and he went through the drawers. There was mail, some of it his, some of it Stiles\u2019s, some of it addressed to both of them. The bottom drawer had bills in it, and he recognized his scrawl on them, noting the date they had been paid. There was a safe in the corner, and on a whim, he tried Laura\u2019s birthday and it popped open. Inside was the deed to their house, the titles to their cars, and their marriage certificate. He texted a picture of it to Stiles, and fifteen minutes later, his phone rang. </p>\n<p>\u201cMy job is the same,\u201d Stiles said, in lieu of a greeting. \u201cEverything's the same, but everyone asked how you were. Did you know we went to see the new James Bond movie last night?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI heard that was good,\u201d Derek said, balancing the phone on his shoulder as he went through the rest of the documents. They apparently had written each other into their wills. Made as much sense as anything, he supposed. </p>\n<p>Stiles made an outraged noise, and Derek could just picture him flailing. \u201cCan you just once react like a normal person about something?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat time are you coming home?\u201d Derek said.</p>\n<p>\u201cStop calling it home. Also, why?\u201d Stiles said. \u201cDo you have a plan to deal with this?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI just wanted to know when to start dinner.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles was quiet for a long moment. \u201cI\u2019m gonna sleep at my dad\u2019s,\u201d he said eventually. </p>\n<p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Derek said, and hung up without saying goodbye. </p>\n<p>In the morning, he woke up in the bed that smelled like Stiles and him. He took a shower, and dried off with a large towel that smelled like the detergent he preferred most. He poked around until he found a door that led to the basement. He could tell right away that this was mostly his domain, Stiles\u2019s scent was almost nonexistent down here. The washing machine and dryer were down here, along with boxes and a few exercise.machines. But there was a corner with tools and a drop cloth, and on the drop cloth was a motorcycle. It was rusted and half taken apart, and there was a mess of broken parts and gears littered around. He had always wanted to customize a bike. He sat down on the stool near it, and carefully ran his hands over it. </p>\n<p>He took himself out for lunch at a nearby diner when his stomach started growling. The place was pretty empty, so he just picked a random booth in the back to slouch into. When the waitress walked up, he opened his mouth to place his order, but closed it again when she slid into the booth across from him. </p>\n<p>\u201cJune said you and Stiles are having problems,\u201d she said without preamble. Her name tag said Sheila. He felt certain he had never talked to her before. </p>\n<p>\u201cJune talks too much,\u201d he said, hunching his shoulders. It seemed like the thing to say. His social skills were getting a workout. </p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t I know it.\u201d she agreed. \u201cBut I saw his Jeep in the Sheriff\u2019s driveway last night.\u201d She focused her eyes on him like laser beams. \u201cAll night.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDid you,\u201d he said flatly. </p>\n<p>She seemed unbothered by his uncommunicativeness. \u201cNow, I saw the good Sheriff at the drugstore yesterday, and he seemed fine, and I know Melissa is doing fine. So it seems June might be onto something.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe roast beef looks good,\u201d Derek said pathetically, tracing a finger on the menu. </p>\n<p>She ignored him. \u201cNow if it is serious enough that you kicked him out, Derek, I would have to say--\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI didn\u2019t kick him out,\u201d Derek interrupted. It was the truth, strictly speaking. </p>\n<p>Her entire demeanor changed instantly. \u201cOh honey,\u201d she said, sympathetically. \u201cHe left?\u201d He nodded. \u201cYou poor thing,\u201d she said, rising. She pulled the menu out of his hands, and stalked off. Derek hadn\u2019t actually ordered, but he sat there quietly, and stared at his hands. When Sheila returned, she was carrying several plates, all of his favorites. He didn\u2019t know how she knew, but there was even whipped cream on a sliver of pie. Every time she walked by, she squeezed his shoulder reassuringly. He left her a huge tip when he finished. </p>\n<p>He went to Autozone next. He had a list of things he needed for the motorcycle, and he spent a satisfying amount of time picking them out. When the man at the counter rang him up, he handed over the receipt with a gruff, \u201cKeep your chin up.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cThanks,\u201d Derek said, and went home. </p>\n<p>Around six, Stiles slammed into the house. Derek was outside, flipping burgers on the grill, but he could hear Stiles shouting his name and stomping around. When he finally stuck his head outside, Derek calmly shut the top of the grill, and turned to face him. </p>\n<p>\u201cDid you sic everyone in this damn town on me?\u201d Stiles said, furious. </p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Derek drawled. </p>\n<p>\u201cFernando at the coffee shop refused to serve me,\u201d Stiles shouted. \u201cDo you know how long he\u2019s known me? Since I was <i>five</i>. When I asked him what his problem was, his wife told me you were a <i>nice boy</i> and I shouldn\u2019t be so mean.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI am a nice boy,\u201d Derek said, smirking a little. </p>\n<p>\u201cYou are a gigantic asshole, is what you are,\u201d Stiles informed him. </p>\n<p>Derek noticed the duffel bag on his shoulder. \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d he said, gesturing. </p>\n<p>Stiles rolled his eyes, color coming to his cheeks. \u201cMy dad said he wasn\u2019t aiding and abetting my giving up without a better reason.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t tell him it was a spell?\u201d Derek asked. </p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Stiles shot back. \u201cI like not being committed for insanity.\u201d He shifted his weight from one side to the other, suddenly uncertain. \u201cI can get a hotel room if you\u2019d rather.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s your magic house too,\u201d Derek said, turning back to the grill. \u201cGo get me a plate.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes dear,\u201d Stiles said dryly but he was smiling when he turned away. </p>\n<p>When Stiles started yawning, and dropped his head back on the couch, Derek said, \u201cTake the bed. I\u2019ll sleep out here.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, okay,\u201d Stiles said, and disappeared down the hall. Derek watched his slim hips as he walked away. </p>\n<p>In the morning, Derek did the laundry. Stiles had left his duffel next to the bed, and Derek picked through it enough to take out the things that smelled worn, and added them to his own pile. He\u2019d been doing his laundry at the laundromat previously, and he was man enough to admit that this was better, easier. It was nice to be able to leave the dryer unattended as he puttered around the house, doing the stuff that needed to be done. Maybe when the spell was done, and his life went back to normal, he\u2019d find this house and buy it. If it really existed. </p>\n<p>When he was done, he went grocery shopping again. Stiles had eaten cereal standing up this morning, and he supposed they\u2019d need more milk sooner than not. June smiled at him when he walked in.</p>\n<p>\u201cCouldn\u2019t help but notice the Jeep in your driveway last night,\u201d she called. </p>\n<p>\u201cCouldn\u2019t help but drive by to check, you mean,\u201d an older man loitering by the beer snorted. </p>\n<p>\u201cShut up, Jimmy,\u201d June snapped, but turned a beaming grin on Derek. \u201cPlanning a welcome home dinner?\u201d she said hopefully. </p>\n<p>\u201cUm,\u201d Derek said, caught off guard. </p>\n<p>\u201cI thought so,\u201d she said. \u201cJimmy, didn\u2019t I say so? I said, I bet Derek Hale\u2019ll be in today to buy some of that swordfish for his man, just you wait.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cCould use some of that fish myself,\u201d Jimmy said.</p>\n<p>\u201cShut up, Jimmy,\u201d she said, and grabbed Derek by the wrist, towing him towards the back. </p>\n<p>He stopped for gas on the way home. At the pump, a familiar cop car pulled up behind him. \u201cDerek,\u201d the Sheriff said, slamming the door shut. </p>\n<p>\u201cSheriff,\u201d Derek said, knuckles squeezing tight around the handle. </p>\n<p>\u201cStiles come home last night?\u201d he asked, sticking his hands in his pockets. </p>\n<p>\u201cYes sir,\u201d Derek said. </p>\n<p>\u201cGood,\u201d the Sheriff said. \u201cYou know, I expected this years ago.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDid you?\u201d Derek said, aiming for casual. </p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t play stupid, son,\u201d he snapped irritably. \u201cI know I didn\u2019t have much faith in the beginning, especially considering how young Stiles was. But I told him, and I\u2019ll tell you now that there are things worth fighting for and your family is one of them.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI know that,\u201d Derek said. </p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d the Sheriff said. \u201cI\u2019m sure you do.\u201d </p>\n<p>The fuel pump clicked as it finished, and Derek busied himself with putting it away, trying to avoid Stiles\u2019s dad\u2019s eyes. </p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll expect you Saturday as usual,\u201d the Sheriff said, finally, turning away. </p>\n<p>\u201cNo problem,\u201d Derek said, and got in the car. </p>\n<p>Stiles came home just as everything was beginning to fill the house with good smells and he made an appreciative noise, coming into the kitchen. \u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d he said, looking in the oven. </p>\n<p>\u201cNothing,\u201d Derek said. \u201cI had time.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt looks good,\u201d Stiles said. \u201cI always liked fish.\u201d</p>\n<p>Watching Stiles eat was mildly horrifying. He talked the entire time, not even pausing to chew. Derek listened to his complicated story about a coworker\u2019s fight with the water cooler, which turned into a rant about tap water, which went into a rant about climate change. Stiles\u2019s brain worked so differently than his own, it was fascinating to listen to. </p>\n<p>\u201cSorry,\u201d Stiles said abruptly, cutting himself off. \u201cYou should have stopped me. What\u2019d you do today?\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek shrugged, chasing the last bite of fish around his plate. \u201cDid laundry,\u201d he said. \"Fixed the back steps.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re a regular househusband,\u201d Stiles said. \u201cMust be why I keep you around.\u201d</p>\n<p>It was the first time Stiles referenced anything about their situation being positive, but it was hard not to scowl at Stiles\u2019s tone. </p>\n<p>\u201cHey,\u201d Stiles said, catching his face. \u201cSorry, I didn\u2019t mean--\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d Derek said, picking up his plate. \u201cI\u2019ll be upstairs if you need me.\u201d</p>\n<p>He was reading in the office when he heard a car pull up. \u201cStiles,\u201d Scott yelled from the driveway. His voice was tinged with anger, and Derek tensed. </p>\n<p>He heard Stiles open the door. \u201cStop yelling, you know the neighbors are nosy as hell.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy did I have to hear that you and Derek are divorcing from the guy at the liquor store?\u201d Scott squawked as he came inside. \u201cHave you even been to counseling? Why didn\u2019t you <i>call</i> me?\u201d</p>\n<p>It was a good point. Why didn\u2019t either of them think of Scott? Derek put a bookmark in his book, and closed it. </p>\n<p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t a big deal,\u201d Stiles said grumpily. \u201cI slept at my dad\u2019s house <i>one night.</i>\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLike you\u2019ve ever done that before,\u201d Scott said. \u201cI\u2019m surprised Derek didn\u2019t sleep on his roof.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cJesus, Scott. He\u2019s right upstairs,\u201d Stiles hissed, and Derek took that as his cue to come down. </p>\n<p>\u201cScott,\u201d he said, nodding. </p>\n<p>\u201cHey,\u201d Scott said, ducking his head. \u201cSorry about--\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek waved him off. It wasn\u2019t exactly an unfair judgment. </p>\n<p>\u201cDude, so have you noticed anything strange going on lately?\u201d Stiles said. \u201cOr smelled anything with your wolf nose?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLike what?\u201d Scott said, confused. </p>\n<p>\u201cLike magic?\u201d Stiles suggested. \u201cHas anyone new come to town? Anything freaky?\u201d</p>\n<p>Scott looked between them both like they were nuts. \u201cDoes this have anything to do with why you were fighting?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m going out,\u201d Derek said, grabbing his coat. \u201cI\u2019ll be back later.\u201d He wasn\u2019t all that invested in finding out what was going on anyway. </p>\n<p>When he returned, Stiles was alone. \u201cDid you tell him?\u201d Derek asked. </p>\n<p>\u201cTried,\u201d Stiles admitted. \u201cHe didn\u2019t understand, like at all. He thinks we lost our memories.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek grunted, shedding his jacket and hanging it up. </p>\n<p>\u201cHey,\u201d Stiles said suddenly. \u201cDo you want to switch off who gets the bed?\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s okay,\u201d Derek said. \u201cYou take it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Stiles said, determined. \u201cIt\u2019s not fair. We could share, then.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat,\u201d Derek said.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s a big bed,\u201d Stiles said. </p>\n<p>Derek thought of the soft blankets and the pleasant smell that permeated every square inch. \u201cIf you\u2019re sure.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sure,\u201d Stiles said. </p>\n<p>Stiles was terrible at bedsharing, as it turned out. They started off on their own sides, bodies stiff and not touching. Then, Stiles drifted off, and relaxed. Not long after that, he rolled, tucking his body against Derek\u2019s, an arm swung over his chest. Derek thought about what Scott\u2019s theory, that they had lost their memories. Stiles hadn\u2019t agreed with it, continuing to argue for an alternate universe, or something like that. </p>\n<p>Derek sort of thought it was all wish fulfillment, on his side at least. It sort of sucked for Stiles to be caught up in it. </p>\n<p>The next day was Saturday, which meant that Stiles didn\u2019t have to go to work. Derek carefully shoved Stiles off and went for a run. He stuck to the woods mostly, avoiding his family\u2019s burned out house, but circled the rest of the territory. On the way home, he cut through some residential streets, and there were people standing in their driveways, getting the paper, mowing their lawns, and many of them nodded to Derek, like he was a part of the community, like he was someone not to be afraid of. </p>\n<p>That was the part of all this that freaked him out the most, he thought. </p>\n<p>When he got back, Stiles was watching TV in his pajamas, looking rumpled and sleepy-eyed. Derek tossed a paper bag on his chest, and Stiles immediately attacked it, ripping it open to find the pastry Derek bought him.</p>\n<p>\u201cDude, sweet,\u201d he said gratefully. </p>\n<p>Derek parked himself on the couch next to him and tried not to find it endearing when Stiles managed to get powdered sugar and cream filling all over himself in his haste to devour it.</p>\n<p>\u201cYour dad mentioned dinner,\u201d he said eventually. </p>\n<p>\u201cApparently it\u2019s a regular thing,\u201d Stiles said reluctantly. </p>\n<p>\u201cWe don\u2019t have to go,\u201d Derek said. \u201cOr you can go, and I\u2019ll stay home.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles shook his head. \u201cHe\u2019d probably freak out. Better to just get it over with.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek had never been in the ground level of the Stilinski home before. It was nice, bright and airy, and the house smelled good, like pot roast. </p>\n<p>\u201cDerek, Stiles,\u201d the Sheriff said as he opened the door. His gaze was assessing, and Derek was pretty sure he was going to fail whatever test the Sheriff was throwing at him. </p>\n<p>Scott and Allison were there already, sitting on the couch, talking to Melissa. Stiles got involved in whatever they were discussing pretty quickly, hands moving in a blur as he talked. Derek stood there, trying not to loom and not succeeding. </p>\n<p>\u201cSit down,\u201d the Sheriff ordered, pointing to a chair near his own. \u201cYou\u2019re making me nervous.\u201d </p>\n<p>As a kid, Derek\u2019s house had always been full of people. He had five sisters, and their friends were usually tramping down the stairs yelling, while the adults of the pack came in and out. People were always trying to see his grandmother, who had been alpha, and his father who had been her second. He had disliked it at the time, always trying to slip away, to get some time on his own. </p>\n<p>When he got it, all those long years of time on his own, he had surprised himself with how much he hated it. He didn\u2019t know how to change it, couldn\u2019t seem to be less alone. Apparently in this world he had, and it was clear from the way Scott was easy with him, the way Melissa directed conversation at him, that he was considered family here. </p>\n<p>He had no idea how that could possibly have happened. It seemed an insurmountable task for even magic to achieve. </p>\n<p>After a while, he settled into the chair more easily, content. He met the Sheriff\u2019s eyes at one point, and they seemed slightly warmer. Maybe the test was easier than he thought. </p>\n<p>Stiles was tense on the way home. Derek couldn\u2019t figure out why, because he seemed fine, happy even, at dinner. It had gone well, he thought, minus how there had been a weird moment when Melissa had hugged Derek goodbye, and he hadn\u2019t been expecting it. His arms had gotten trapped at his sides and he had been stiff as a board, but Melissa had hung on until he managed to wiggle his arm up to pat her on the back. </p>\n<p>Then they had stepped out into the cold air, and Stiles had been rigid, radiating unhappiness everywhere. Derek didn\u2019t know what he\u2019d done, but he waited, sure Stiles would tell him.</p>\n<p>He was right. The moment they stepped through their door, Stiles whirled on him. \u201cWe have to figure out what\u2019s doing this,\u201d he said tightly. \u201cThis can\u2019t just be our lives now.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek took a moment to figure out how to react, hanging his jacket on the coatrack, but Stiles misinterpreted his silence as Derek ignoring him. </p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m serious,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t understand why you\u2019re not. We need to be hunting this, or investigating. We should go to Deaton, or find some books, do <i>something.</i> Derek, come on, you know I\u2019m right.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course you\u2019re right,\u201d Derek said, anger beginning to color his words. \u201cI know, I know you\u2019re miserable and you hate this. I know this is your nightmare, but it\u2019s not mine, so don\u2019t act like you don\u2019t know why I\u2019d want to stay here.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou think this is a <i>punishment</i> for me?\u201d Stiles yelled. \u201cYou\u2019re wrong. Jesus, why do you think I\u2019m so mad? You didn\u2019t even like me, and now we\u2019re <i>married</i>, we\u2019re together, and you\u2019ve never wanted--\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek kissed him, trying to stop the flow of words. It didn\u2019t work at first. Stiles was still trying to yell at him, aggrieved noises escaping out of his mouth but his hands came up to wind around Derek\u2019s neck, hauling him closer. Derek let him, clutching at his hips, and kissed him all the harder, trying to convey exactly how much he has wanted. Stiles stopped trying to talk after a bit, and tugged backwards, forcing Derek to take a few lumbering steps towards the couch. They fell together, Derek shooting his hands out to catch his weight before he landed on Stiles. </p>\n<p>\u201cThis is the opposite of what I was going for, actually,\u201d, Stiles said breathlessly, but his hands were busy at Derek\u2019s waist, shoving his shirt up around his armpits. Derek took it off, tossing it to the floor. \u201cGod, you\u2019re ridiculous,\u201d Stiles groaned, and his nail scraped over Derek\u2019s nipple, making him hiss and arch. Stiles did it again, and Derek dove forward, hiding his moan into in Stiles\u2019s mouth. The way his lips curved into a smirk under his said Stiles had heard it anyway. </p>\n<p>Stiles\u2019s hands were everywhere, running up Derek\u2019s back, his arms, cupping the back of his neck. It made Derek shiver, and his skin felt like it was on fire everywhere Stiles touched. He twitched when Stiles bit his lip, and the movement made their cocks align, made them both groan. </p>\n<p>\u201cBack up,\u201d Stiles hissed, shoving at Derek\u2019s chest. \u201cThe pants have gotta go, they gotta,\u201d but the rest of his sentence was bitten off when Derek moved backwards onto his heels, absolutely ripping at Stiles\u2019s fly until he got it open and got his hand around Stiles. He leaned down to take it in his mouth immediately, reveling in the taste. Stiles arched, body strung tight with surprise and Derek gripped his hips, holding him down as he sucked. \u201cOh my God,\u201d Stiles said, voice low, like the words were being torn out of his chest. \u201cDerek, fuck.\u201d</p>\n<p>He let go of Stiles\u2019s hip with one hand, and shoved at Stiles\u2019s thigh until Stiles got it, and bent it, spreading himself wider. Derek stroked his hand down the inside of his thigh and then cupped Stiles\u2019s balls. He ran a finger behind, pressing between Stiles\u2019s cheeks, just testing, and Stiles grunted his approval, opening his legs wider. Derek pressed the tip of his finger into Stiles\u2019s hole, dry, and Stiles howled, his whole body tightening as he spilled down Derek\u2019s throat. </p>\n<p>Derek made to back off but Stiles shook his head. \u201cC'mon,\u201d he urged. \u201cDo it.\u201d</p>\n<p>They were going too fast, Derek thought, Stiles was probably going to regret this, regret <i>him</i> tomorrow, but he couldn\u2019t stop himself from wetting two fingers and fingering Stiles open. Stiles was shaking a little under his hands, but he was starting to push back down on Derek\u2019s fingers, his cock twitching like it could be ready to go again. Derek had to shove his own cock against the couch cushions, still encased in his jeans to keep from blowing it too soon. \u201cI don\u2019t have anything,\u201d he gritted out. \u201cI don\u2019t know where in this house--\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles barked out a laugh. \u201cI do, found it this morning.\u201d He reached up, the long line of his arm stretching to reach the deep pocket on the side of the couch, and produced a tube of slick. Derek surged up to kiss him again, and Stiles gasped as his cock dragged against the rough of Derek\u2019s pants. \u201cC\u2019mon,\u201d he said again, plucking weakly at Derek\u2019s belt. Derek stood up long enough to get them off, kicking them sideways, and then dropped back down over Stiles. </p>\n<p>\u201cAre you sure,\u201d he said intensely, trying to read Stiles. \u201cWe don\u2019t have to, we could stop--\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll kill you if you do,\u201d Stiles said, taking himself in hand. He was hard again and was flushed with it, sweat running down his neck. \u201cWe\u2019re doing this.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek kind of thought it might kill him if he did, but he wrapped a hand around his cock, slicking it as best he could and guided it in. </p>\n<p>\u201cOh my God,\u201d Stiles said, his eyes going impossibly wide. He clutched at Derek\u2019s back, nails digging in as Derek pressed farther and farther until he couldn\u2019t get any closer. </p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019ve done this before, right?\u201d Derek said, the thought only just occurring to him. </p>\n<p>\u201cSex, yes,\u201d Stiles said, shifting his hips experimentally. \u201cThis, in particular? No.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d Derek said, and buried all the ridiculous feeling his words triggered. \u201cI should\u2019ve--\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou should move,\u201d Stiles ordered. He smacked at Derek\u2019s shoulder, and Derek huffed out a laugh and did as told. He kept a slow pace, replacing Stiles\u2019s hand on his dick with his own, and jacked him in time with his thrusts. Stiles unraveled underneath him, eyes bright and lips so red where he was biting them. Derek wanted to burn this all into his memory, the sight of Stiles like this for him, the feel of him where Derek was inside, the sounds that were coming out of his mouth, unabashed and loud. </p>\n<p>\u201cStiles,\u201d he had to say, too soon. \u201cI\u2019m close, I\u2019m gonna--\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Stiles said. \u201cYeah, c\u2019mon, let me see.\u201d Derek came with a groan, shuddering with his orgasm. His grip on Stiles slowed and slackened, and Stiles arched underneath him, fucking himself into Derek\u2019s fist until he was coming again, warm and sticky between them. </p>\n<p>\u201cRocks, paper, scissors you for cleanup,\u201d Stiles said after a minute or two of afterglow. </p>\n<p>\u201cCould shower together,\u201d Derek said. Stiles\u2019s eyes lit up and he held his hands out imperiously. Derek grabbed him and hauled him to his feet, and led him upstairs. </p>\n<p>He fell asleep, with a gold band on his left hand and Stiles tucked up under his arm. </p>\n<p>He woke up alone in the train station, on the cold, hard pallet in the corner. It was inevitable, he thought to himself. None of it was real to begin with, so what was the point of mourning it? He forced himself to close himself off, to squash the softness of the last week out of him, but he found himself dressing anyway, jumping in his car to trace the streets back to that red house. </p>\n<p>It existed in reality, he found. It was for sale too, sitting empty and quiet on the street. None of the neighbors waved to him but their eyes were open and curious and he held up a hand in greeting. </p>\n<p>He leaned against his car, studying the house, and tried to pull himself together. He heard the Jeep before he saw it, rec ognized the heartbeat that was pounding just a little faster than normal. </p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s real,\u201d Stiles said when he had shut off the car and climbed out. \u201cI thought maybe it\u2019d be an empty lot or something.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s real,\u201d Derek said, and refused to look at him. Stiles came over and leaned against the car with him, sides barely brushing. </p>\n<p>\u201cYou should buy it,\u201d Stiles said, and Derek froze. \u201cI would, but I have about ten dollars in the bank.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat would I do with it?\u201d Derek said. </p>\n<p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m not having sex in your train car, so that\u2019d be reason one.\u201d </p>\n<p>Derek looked at him then, turning his whole body to stare. Stiles\u2019s color was high in his cheeks, and his fists were clenched in determination, but there was also hope in his eyes. </p>\n<p>\u201cYou still want all that?\u201d Derek said, incredulously, gesturing at the house. His chest was tight and he clenched his fist to keep his hands from shaking. </p>\n<p>\u201cI think we should maybe date first,\u201d Stiles said. \u201cWe don\u2019t have to skip all that this time.\u201d He emphasized \u201cthis time\u201d with a wry tone to his voice, smiling.</p>\n<p>\u201cDate,\u201d Derek said dubiously, and he knew he was saying it like other people would say \u201cshark attack.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cDate,\u201d Stiles repeated firmly, but he bumped his hip against Derek\u2019s. </p>\n<p>Derek turned and pinned him against the car, kissing him. \u201cI\u2019ll make an offer on Monday,\u201d he said hoarsely. </p>\n<p>\u201cGood,\u201d Stiles said, and pulled him close.</p>"
