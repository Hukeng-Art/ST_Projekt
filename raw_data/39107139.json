  "summary": "<p>Tim knows, he just knows, that Jason is about to ruin everything. Jason is going to tell Bruce about his parents, and Bruce is going to misunderstand, and then he\u2019ll call CPS, and Tim is going to be trapped in a group home and nobody is going to adopt him because nobody wants to adopt a fifteen-year-old, and he\u2019s going to get into drugs and die under a bridge before he\u2019s eighteen, and it\u2019s all because of one stupid broken arm.</p>",
  "notes": "<p>Wrote this in 36 hours because i just had to get it out of my system. Thanks to <a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/users/cynassa\" rel=\"nofollow\">cynassa</a> and also to the guy next to me on the train who let me take possession of the charger for the entirety of the train ride.</p>\n<p class=\"jump\">(See the end of the work for <a href=\"#work_endnotes\">more notes</a>.)</p>\n<p>Tim moves into the Manor, and the next time his parents come back to Gotham, Bruce blackmails them into letting Tim stay with him officially. Jason calls it kidnapping, Bruce calls it parenting.</p>",
  "text": "<p>The beginning of the end starts when Tim breaks his arm. </p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t even break it on patrol. If he did, things might have been different. But he breaks it during PE, which is just embarrassing. He breaks it while getting tackled by Scott Andrews during a friendly football match, which is worse, especially because Scott seems genuinely apologetic and keeps asking if he needs anything.</p>\n<p>The only thing Tim needs right now is for the school nurse to not call his parents, but he can\u2019t say that, so he just tells Scott it\u2019s cool and his arm barely even hurts anymore, really, there\u2019s no need to feel bad or do anything. </p>\n<p>It's also what he tells the nurse, who does not seem impressed while they wait for the ambulance to arrive. \u201cThey\u2019re busy,\u201d he says, which is true. They <em>are</em> busy. On a dig in South Africa. \u201cI can just get a cab home from the hospital.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI can\u2019t let you do that. I\u2019m very sorry, but if your parents don\u2019t answer their phones until you\u2019re ready to be released, the school and the hospital are going to have to act.\u201d</p>\n<p>Shit, Tim thinks, shit, shit, shit. Okay. The chance of either of his parents checking their phones any time soon? Slim. The chance of them calling back? Practically non-existent. He needs a plan, and he needs it now.</p>\n<p>\u201cMy parents are on a business trip. They probably don\u2019t have service right now,\u201d he says. When backed into a corner, it\u2019s always best to start with the truth. The nurse is frowning, but he\u2019s just heard sirens in the distance, so he needs to be quick about this. \u201cThat\u2019s why my uncle is watching me right now. They must have forgotten to inform the school. So you don\u2019t have to worry about me going to the hospital on my own, because our uncle will meet me there.\u201d</p>\n<p>The nurse is starting to look a bit more relaxed. It\u2019s probably not because of Tim\u2019s lying skills, but rather because she doesn\u2019t actually want to deal with a case of criminal neglect, but, whatever. He\u2019ll take it. \u201cWhat\u2019s your uncle\u2019s name?\u201d she asks, getting a notepad and a pen. \u201cIf you give me his contact details, I\u2019ll be in touch.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cEdward Drake,\u201d Tim says, trying not to fidget while the nurse writes this down. The sirens are getting closer, and the ambulance will be here any minute now. He needs to lock this down now, before the story can spiral out of control. </p>\n<p>The nurse pauses, her pen expectantly hovering over the paper as she waits for him to give her the phone number. Tim takes a deep breath, partly to clear his head and partly to lessen the pain in his arm. </p>\n<p>\u201cAlright,\u201d he says, \u201chere it goes-\u201c</p>\n<p>At least, he thinks later when he\u2019s finally in the ambulance, he had enough foresight not to give her a fake. That would have been even more suspicious, and wouldn\u2019t have helped him in any case. No, it had to be real. It also had to be someone who never answers his phone, ever. Someone who, simply by ignoring all calls out of spite, would give Tim enough time to think of a better plan. Hire an actor to play the part of Edward Drake, maybe. He\u2019s positive he can do it. All he needs is a little bit of time. </p>\n<p>Literally all Jason needs to do is not answer his phone.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">*</p>\n<p>Jason is a busy man. He <em>is</em>. Just because he doesn\u2019t have, like, a job, or a degree, or any prospects whatsoever, doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s just sitting around all day doing nothing, no matter what Dick thinks. Besides, it\u2019s not like Mr Drop Out is any better. </p>\n<p>\u201cLook at me, I\u2019m Dick and I\u2019m so much better than you because I have a gun and a stupid uniform,\u201d Jason mutters spitefully. </p>\n<p>\u201cWhat was that, Master Jason?\u201d Alfred asks politely. </p>\n<p>\u201cNothing,\u201d Jason says and goes back to making pie crust. He\u2019s only doing this because Alfred asked, and because Jason took the time out of his otherwise very full schedule, and also because Alfred is getting old and Jason wants him to look back on his life in a few years and realise that out of all the kids Bruce kidnapped, Jason was the only one thoughtful enough to help out with stuff like this. </p>\n<p>What he hadn\u2019t realised when he agreed is that the pies aren\u2019t for the Wayne family to enjoy, but rather to donate to a local pie-eating-contest that Brucie Wayne organised for good publicity after the latest sex scandal. They need thirty pies, they need them by tomorrow, and Alfred has turned from a mild-mannered gentleman into a scary military taskmaster who is going to haunt Jason in his nightmares. </p>\n<p>Finished with this pie, Jason has just moved on to the next when his phone rings. </p>\n<p>\u201cLess dawdling, more baking,\u201d Alfred says. \u201cThese pies aren\u2019t going to make themselves.\u201d </p>\n<p>Jason looks from the pies to Alfred, who does not appear amused, back to the pies. There\u2019s <em>so many of them</em>. They\u2019re going to be here until midnight, and it\u2019s barely noon. </p>\n<p>Jason\u2019s phone rings again. </p>\n<p>Fuck it. </p>\n<p>\u201cSorry, Alfred, gotta take this,\u201d Jason says, wiping his hands on the apron Alfred forced on him, \u201ccould be important.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYoung sir-\u201c</p>\n<p>\u201cBe right back,\u201d Jason lies and hurries out of the kitchen before Alfred can stop him. He answers the phone while he\u2019s still in earshot, just in case anybody is eavesdropping, saying loudly and exaggeratedly: \u201cHello?\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cThis is Gotham Academy,\u201d says the woman on the other end of the line. \u201cAm I speaking to Mr Drake?\u201d</p>\n<p>The No is already on the tip of Jason\u2019s tongue, but he holds it back just in time. Gotham Academy. Mr Drake. It doesn\u2019t take a genius to figure out that this lady wants to talk to the Replacement\u2019s parents. Maybe he\u2019s in <em>trouble</em>, Jason thinks gleefully. This could be the perfect blackmail material.</p>\n<p>\u201cYep,\u201d he says, \u201cthat\u2019s me. What\u2019s Timothy done now?\u201d</p>\n<p>The woman from Gotham Academy launches into a story that Jason only listens to enough to figure out that, sadly, Tim hasn\u2019t done anything wrong. Something about an accident during PE, broken bones, very sorry, come to the hospital to get him, get in touch with his parents to- wait. Jason tunes back in just in time to hear that apparently, the school failed to contact Mr and Mrs Drake so far, but Tim informed them of the situation, so as long as his uncle has written permission to check Tim out of the hospital and take him home, it\u2019s all fine. </p>\n<p>Jason\u2019s good mood is restored instantly. </p>\n<p>\u201cSure, I\u2019ll come right now,\u201d he says, already pulling on his leather jacket. He remembers just in time that the lady on the phone said something about permission, so he scribbles down a few lines on a piece of paper he found, tugs that into his pocket and is off after telling Alfred that sadly he has to leave right now but he\u2019s sending someone to take his place. On his way to Gotham General, he actually stops at a red light for once, taking the opportunity to text Dick that he needs to come to the manor right now, this very instance, because there\u2019s an emergency and they might have a life or death situation on their hands. That should do it. </p>\n<p>Mr Drake, he thinks once he arrives in the hospital and has successfully bullied a nurse into telling him where the Replacement is being kept. She was clearly sceptical that an 18-year-old is both uncle and current guardian of a 15-year-old, but he must have pulled it off, because she didn\u2019t call the cops. He still has no idea why the school called him instead of the kid\u2019s actual uncle, but it doesn\u2019t matter. This has the potential for a lot of jokes, so Jason is going to give it his all. At the very least, he can go check on the kid and see if he\u2019s dead yet. </p>\n<p>Tim is sitting on the bed, his arm in a cast, ineffectively trying to tie his shoelaces with one hand when Jason comes in. Jason snorts, and Tim\u2019s head snaps towards him. Immediately, Tim pales. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d</p>\n<p>Jason holds up the shitty permission slip he wrote earlier. \u201cGetting you out of here, apparently. What, aren\u2019t you happy to see me, nephew?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t funny,\u201d Tim hisses, eyes darting around in paranoia, probably checking if someone is listening. Nobody is. This is Gotham, this hospital only has like, twenty nurses and doctors, and they\u2019re all busy dealing with the victims of yesterday\u2019s evil sentient flood. There is no way anybody has time to eavesdrop. \u201cSeriously, why are you here?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI got a call saying you needed a lift,\u201d Jason says coldly. \u201cNot my fault the school messed up. I\u2019m surprised you haven\u2019t gone crying to your actual uncle yet.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMy-\u201c Tim stops, frowns. Then, just like that, his face smooths out until his expression is perfectly calm, revealing nothing. \u201cYes,\u201d he says, \u201cyou\u2019re right. I\u2019m going to call him right now. Thank you for coming by.\u201d </p>\n<p>It\u2019s a clear dismissal, which Jason expected. What he didn\u2019t expect is this weird politeness. He admittedly hasn\u2019t talked to the Replacement much since he returned from the dead a few months ago, besides, well, almost killing him that first time, but he does know that the kid isn\u2019t this polite. Not to anybody, and especially not to Jason. </p>\n<p>The only explanation he can come up with is that Tim wants him to leave badly enough to try anything, and, well, that won\u2019t do. </p>\n<p>\u201cI think I\u2019ll stay here until your uncle comes,\u201d Jason says, flopping down on the visitor\u2019s chair. \u201cThat cool with you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, I don\u2019t give a shit.\u201d </p>\n<p>Tim gives up on his shoelaces and, under Jason\u2019s watchful eye, pulls out his phone. The screen is cracked. Tim types in the code, pulls up his list of contacts, selects one and presses the call button. Zero hesitation there, and zero indication that something is up. Suspicious. </p>\n<p>\u201cUncle Ed?\u201d Tim says, ignoring the way Jason is wiping his boots on the bedding. \u201cYeah, it\u2019s me. I\u2019m in Gotham General \u2013 nothing, just a broken arm. Can you come get me? Uh-huh \u2013 okay \u2013 no problem. Alright, I\u2019ll see you tonight.\u201d Tim puts down the phone and says, \u201cMy uncle is busy, so I\u2019ll just take a cab home. Can you-\u201c</p>\n<p>And now, Tim really does hesitate. \u201cCan you sign me out?\u201d</p>\n<p>Jason stares at him, long and hard. Tim blinks back innocently. </p>\n<p><em>Bull. Shit.</em>, Jason thinks, but he doesn\u2019t say so out loud. Instead, he claps Tim on his uninjured shoulder and says, \u201cAlright-y\u201d, and whistles obnoxiously all the way to his bike.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">*</p>\n<p>Jason is here. Tim did not plan for Jason to be here. Tim does not understand <em>why</em> Jason is here. What is he getting out of this? Is this a new form of torture? Tim knows that technically, he should be happy, because Jason did get him out of this mess, but he cannot relax, his mind stuck on all the possible nefarious reasons Jason could have for it. </p>\n<p>That being said, it takes him a while to notice that Jason is not taking them to Bristol. Tim, who is only holding on to Jason\u2019s waist with one arm anyway, uses his cast to tap Jason on the shoulder. \u201cHey,\u201d he says when Jason doesn\u2019t react, \u201cyou\u2019re going the wrong way.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNope.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cAre you kidnapping me?\u201d Tim asks, frowning and, when Jason only laughs, decides to do the only reasonable thing here. He throws himself off the bike. </p>\n<p>Not his smartest idea, considering he has a broken arm. </p>\n<p>While he\u2019s busy gritting his teeth and trying not to scream from the pain, he barely notices Jason pulling to a stop and coming towards him. What he does notice is Jason lightly kicking him. </p>\n<p>\u201cGet up, moron.\u201d</p>\n<p>Tim breathes in, out, in, and finally admits, \u201cI think I broke my wrist.\u201d</p>\n<p>He expects Jason to laugh, but instead, he curses. \u201cWhich one?\u201d</p>\n<p>Tim considers this. \u201cRight one.\u201d He holds up his cast for emphasis, except that only jostles arm <em>and</em> wrist more, making him bite down on a whimper. </p>\n<p>\u201cCould be worse,\u201d Jason says, bowing down to help him up. \u201cIt\u2019s not like you were gonna use that one anytime soon, anyway. Come on, up you go.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to go back to the hospital,\u201d Tim confesses once he\u2019s standing and leaning against Jason\u2019s side. His mind feels sluggish, but he doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s a concussion. Painkillers, probably. </p>\n<p>\u201cYeah? How are you proposing we get your wrist fixed up, then?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t you know a guy?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Jason asks. Weirdly enough, he sounds like he\u2019s holding back a laugh. \u201cWhat guy?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cA guy,\u201d Tim insists. \u201cYou\u2019re a crime lord. You should know a guy.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cAlright, fine,\u201d Jason admits. \u201cI do know a guy. You sure you don\u2019t just want to go back to the hospital, though? It\u2019s not like you got this during patrol. Your parents are allowed to know, and your uncle-\u201c</p>\n<p>\u201cOh my god,\u201d Tim says, \u201cshut up about my stupid uncle and take me to your guy before I punch something with my good hand.\u201d\u00a0 </p>\n<p>Jason refuses to try the bike again and hotwires a car instead, which he locks from the inside so that Tim can\u2019t try another escape attempt. Not that Tim is going to. He is now fairly certain that Jason is taking him to a doctor, or at least someone who can help, even if he still doesn\u2019t know where he\u2019ll be taken afterwards.</p>\n<p>Maybe, he thinks hopefully, Jason will just take him home. </p>\n<p>For the hundredth time today, he checks his phone. Still nothing. </p>\n<p>Jason, picking up on this, runs over a red light and says, \u201cWhat about Bruce?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat about him?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIf your uncle really is busy, you could come back to the manor today, spend the night there.\u201d</p>\n<p>Tim tilts his head, confused. \u201cI can\u2019t patrol,\u201d he points out. </p>\n<p>Jason barely avoids running over a pedestrian, honks the car three times, flips the pedestrian the bird, yells, \u201cFucking move it, grandma!\u201d, and finally says, \u201cSo? You can\u2019t patrol, who cares?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBruce cares.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, if you, like, skipped patrol for fun. But it\u2019s not your fault your arms are like twigs.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThey\u2019re not like <em>twigs</em>,\u201d Tim says, offended. \u201cThey\u2019re very muscular. I work out <em>every day</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd you still got tackled by a teenager,\u201d Jason says, shaking his head sadly. </p>\n<p>\u201c<em>I\u2019m</em> a teenager!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou sure sound like one right now,\u201d Jason says, which doesn\u2019t even make sense. Tim wants to cross his arms petulantly, but he can\u2019t, because of the stupid cast and his stupid broken wrist which is probably going to get a cast of its own soon, and god, why does his life suck so much? </p>\n<p>Jason\u2019s guy lives in a shady basement. He takes one look at Tim, clucks his tongue disapprovingly, and gets to work. \u201cCan\u2019t give you any painkillers,\u201d he says while he examines Tim\u2019s wrist, \u201cbut I probably got some heroin lying around somewhere. Want some?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, thank you,\u201d Tim says politely.</p>\n<p>\u201cCoke?\u201d</p>\n<p>Tim looks to Jason, who shakes his head. \u201cNo, thank you,\u201d Tim repeats. </p>\n<p>Jason\u2019s guy resets his bone and gives him a new cast, Jason exchanges a quick manly hug and fist bump with him that Tim watches in vague disgust, but before they can get out of there, Jason suddenly tells him to wait. \u201cGot to sign your cast!\u201d He takes a pen and writes something on the plaster. Tim cranes his neck and sees that Jason has written SHITHEAD in capital letters. </p>\n<p>\u201cThat kind of makes it sound like that\u2019s your signature,\u201d Tim muses. Jason nods, accepting this criticism, and adds an arrow that points directly at Tim, who probably should have seen this coming. </p>\n<p>And then, because life has the worst timing, Tim\u2019s phone rings just as they\u2019re back in the car that Jason is in the process of hotwiring again. Tim glances at Jason and answers it, angling his head to the side so that Jason won\u2019t hear the other end of the line. </p>\n<p>\u201cRemind me \u2013 how old are you again?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUm,\u201d Tim says, his stomach sinking, \u201cfifteen.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFifteen. You know there are other kids your age who are already in college. When <em>I</em> was fifteen, I would certainly have been able to call for a cab.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI wanted to,\u201d Tim protests, \u201cbut the school-\u201c</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you know how much we pay for your school fees each year?\u201d his mother interrupts in a clipped voice. </p>\n<p>Tim\u2019s stomach sinks further. \u201cUm, a lot?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cA lot,\u201d his mother repeats. There\u2019s another voice, barely audible, and then his mother\u2019s voice again, no longer addressing Tim: \u201cHe says he thinks it\u2019s \u2018a lot\u2019.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSorry,\u201d Tim mutters, but his mother isn\u2019t listening anymore. </p>\n<p>\u201cWe pay sixteen thousand dollars a year, to give you the best education possible, and we pay it in the assumption that it\u2019s enough for your school to not bother us about every trivial incident.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMom-\u201c Tim tries. From the periphery of his vision, he sees Jason turn to stare at him. </p>\n<p>\u201cI suppose this is our fault,\u201d his mother says, in a tone that makes it clear that she thinks otherwise, \u201cfor trusting you to be mature about this. Your father and I owe you an apology for overestimating you. Jack?\u201d More mumbled voices, then: \u201cApologise to Tim for overestimating him.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cMom, you don\u2019t need to-\u201c</p>\n<p>\u201cSorry, son,\u201d his father says, apparently having taking possession of the phone, \u201cdon\u2019t mind your mom. We\u2019d be there if we could, but you know we can\u2019t leave here until August.\u201d </p>\n<p>Tim drops his gaze. It\u2019s May. The last time he spoke to his parents, they said they\u2019d be back in July, in time for his birthday. They <em>promised</em>. </p>\n<p>\u201cWe gotta go,\u201d his father says, \u201cso take care of that broken leg, and we\u2019ll talk to you soon, okay, buddy?\u201d There\u2019s a click. He hasn\u2019t even said goodbye.</p>\n<p>Jason is still staring. \u201cWere those your <em>parents</em>?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Tim lies, but Jason takes the phone from his unresisting fingers and points accusingly at the caller ID, where it clearly says MOM. Tim deflates. \u201cAlright, so it was my parents,\u201d he admits. \u201cBut they\u2019re very busy. They can\u2019t be expected to deal with this sort of thing.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat sort of thing, having a son?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo! Just, you know. All the annoying bits. Like getting calls from the school or making doctor\u2019s appointments and stuff. I\u2019m old enough to take care of myself.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jason\u2019s stare is getting more intense. It makes Tim\u2019s skin itch. \u201cI thought your uncle was watching you,\u201d he says. </p>\n<p>Tim rapidly nods. \u201cHe is! Today was just bad timing because he\u2019s out of town, but he\u2019s coming back tonight.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYour parents didn\u2019t mention him.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThey were probably just annoyed that the school called them instead of him.\u201d</p>\n<p>A few seconds pass. Then, suddenly, Jason smiles a sharkish grin. Tim shudders. \u201cAlright then, you win.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI do?\u201d Tim asks suspiciously.</p>\n<p>\u201cYep. I\u2019m driving you back to your house, right now. And when we\u2019re there, we can wait for your uncle together.\u201d</p>\n<p>Tim forces a smile on his face. \u201cThat\u2019s not necessary, I can-\u201c</p>\n<p>\u201cPlease,\u201d Jason says and winks, \u201cI insist.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"center\">*</p>\n<p>So Bruce\u2019s new kid is a little fucked up, no surprise there. Jason did think it was suspicious, back when he first came back and realised that this isn\u2019t another orphan that Bruce adopted, it\u2019s just the neighbour\u2019s kid. Where\u2019s the trauma, he thought, where\u2019s the horrific backstory?<br>\nTurns out it\u2019s right there, happening in front of Bruce\u2019s eyes. </p>\n<p>While Jason drives them both to the Replacement\u2019s house, he remembers that he\u2019s been here before, one time. This was before his attack on the Tower, when he was still in the process of stalking Bruce\u2019s new kid in order to best figure out his weaknesses. He\u2019d watched little Timothy Drake eat cereal straight from the package, ignore all the dishes piled up high in the sink, and use the polished floors of the ballroom for skateboard practice. Somehow, it had not occurred to him that all of this might be happening without parental supervision. </p>\n<p>\u201cGo on ahead,\u201d he tells Tim once they arrive, \u201cI\u2019m just gonna have a quick smoke.\u201d It\u2019s not a lie, but he uses his smoking break to text Bruce: <em>Does Tim have an uncle?</em> </p>\n<p>Bruce\u2019s reply is instantaneous. <em>No</em>.</p>\n<p>Jason nods to himself and texts back: <em>Who\u2019s watching Tim while his parents are out of town?<br>\n</em></p>\n<p>This time the reply takes longer. <em>The housekeeper, I assume. Why?<br>\n</em></p>\n<p>Jason replies <em>nvm lol </em>and follows Tim into the house. He comes to a stop in the kitchen, where on a large calendar every Tuesday and Thursday is highlighted in yellow. Every yellow box reads MRS MAC. Twice a week, then. </p>\n<p>The picture is starting to get clearer. </p>\n<p>Tim is nowhere in sight, so Jason rummages around in the fridge for some ingredients that he can use to make a quick dinner, only to find that the fridge is empty save for two dozen cans of Red Bull and the remnants of a takeout meal that must have been a curry once upon a time. </p>\n<p><em>Does Tim eat at the manor?</em> He texts Bruce. </p>\n<p>Instead of texting back, Bruce calls him. </p>\n<p>Jason doesn\u2019t answer. He doesn\u2019t have time for the old man\u2019s paranoia. He has to deal with his own paranoia first. \u201cTimtam,\u201d he calls out, \u201ccome here this minute or I\u2019m burning the place down.\u201d</p>\n<p>He counts the seconds in his head, reaching all the way to twenty-seven before Tim comes running into the kitchen on socked feet, nearly slipping but catching himself on the counter in the last minute. </p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPack a bag and get your coat,\u201d Jason orders. \u201cWe\u2019re going to the Manor.\u201d</p>\n<p>Tim attempts to cross his arms, only to wince when he is forcibly reminded of the cast. \u201cNo, we\u2019re not. You promised we\u2019d wait for my uncle.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jason sighs. \u201cTim, you don\u2019t have an uncle.\u201d</p>\n<p>The doorbell rings. </p>\n<p>Tim lights up. \u201cI\u2019ll go!\u201d He\u2019s disappeared before Jason can catch him, and by the time Jason has made his way into the front hall, there\u2019s a strange man standing there, trapping Tim in a firm hug. Tim\u2019s look is one of triumph. \u201cJason, meet Uncle Eddie.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHi,\u201d Uncle Eddie says, giving Jason a little wave. \u201cHey, aren\u2019t you Brucie Wayne\u2019s kid? Can I get an autograph?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s your uncle,\u201d Jason says flatly. Tim nods. \u201cBullshit,\u201d Jason hisses, pointing an accusing finger at him. \u201cNo way.\u201d</p>\n<p>Uncle Eddie releases Tim from his hold and says, \u201cHey, man, no need to be so aggressive about it. Take a chill pill.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat the <em>hell</em> did you just say to me?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cJason!\u201d Tim says and, after a quick glance to his left, adds, \u201cUncle Eddie, stop it. Why don\u2019t you, um, go to your room?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat room?\u201d Uncle Eddie asks.</p>\n<p>\u201cYour room,\u201d Tim says pointedly. \u201cThe guest room, where you always stay when you\u2019re watching me. That room.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cRight, that room,\u201d Uncle Eddie says, salutes them, and walks into what Jason, thanks to all his stalking, knows to be a supply closet. </p>\n<p>Jason\u2019s phone rings; it\u2019s Bruce again. </p>\n<p>\u201cAren\u2019t you going to answer that?\u201d Tim asks, eyes darting nervously between Jason and the closed closet door. No doubt that the second Jason is distracted, Tim, having realised the jig is up, is going to bolt. </p>\n<p>Jason takes his still-ringing phone and, looking Tim dead in the eye, drops it in the trashcan. </p>\n<p>It keeps ringing. </p>\n<p>\u201cUm,\u201d Tim says, \u201cwas that, like, meant to do anything? Because I think all you managed to do is crack your screen.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jason takes the phone out, throws it on the ground, and stomps on it. The ringing stops. </p>\n<p>\u201cNow,\u201d he says coldly, \u201cyou can pack a bag and come willingly, or I can knock you unconscious and carry you. What\u2019s it going to be?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut my uncle-\u201c</p>\n<p>\u201cTim.\u201d </p>\n<p>Tim is the first to look away, dropping his gaze to inspect his shoes. \u201cWhat\u2019s going to happen in the Manor?\u201d he mutters. </p>\n<p>Jason frowns at him. \u201cYou\u2019re going to tell Bruce that your parents suck, you\u2019re going to have a dinner that\u2019s not made of caffeine or mold, and then you\u2019re going to bed early because you\u2019re injured and you\u2019ve been on your feet all day.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, but- my arm.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Jason says, uncomprehending, \u201cI know. I just said-\u201c</p>\n<p>\u201cNo!\u201d Tim lifts his arm with the cast, beginning to look frustrated. \u201cI won\u2019t be able to do <em>anything</em> for at least a month. I can\u2019t even write, because I\u2019m right-handed.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cYeah? So? If you\u2019re that worried about being bored, I\u2019ll rec you some good movies later.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cJason,\u201d Tim says, and, oh, he sounds serious. \u201cYou\u2019re not listening. I\u2019m useless like this. It\u2019s already hard enough being Robin when you\u2019re right there all the time, but there is no way Bruce is going to let me keep it after this. The only thing that\u2019s going to happen in the Manor is that I\u2019ll be kicked out.\u201d</p>\n<p>A few seconds pass, then a few more. Jason has understood every word, but his brain is somehow not computing. Because if he heard right, then, god, the Replacement is more messed up than he thought. Where does Bruce <em>find</em> these kids?</p>\n<p>\u201cFine,\u201d Jason says eventually. \u201cDon\u2019t pack a bag then. But you\u2019re coming with me, and if I\u2019m right, which I literally always am, then you\u2019re the one who will have to come all the way back here later just to get your shit. Now get that idiot out of the closet and let\u2019s go.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"center\">*</p>\n<p>Tim has literally never been this nervous. He\u2019s so anxious he wants to throw up, and that feeling isn\u2019t helped by the fact that when they enter the Manor \u2013 without ringing the doorbell, they just walked in like criminals \u2013, there is the overwhelming smell of pie everywhere.<br>\nThere are voices drifting out of the kitchen, Alfred\u2019s dry tone and Dick\u2019s excitement unmistakable. There is also \u2013 oh no \u2013 Bruce\u2019s deep rumble, followed now by an offended: \u201cDon\u2019t <em>touch</em> that!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, shit,\u201d Jason says, and Tim barely has time to wonder why he, too, suddenly looks queasy, but then they enter the kitchen \u2013 the kitchen with what appears to be several dozen pies \u2013, and Alfred, hands on his hips, disapproval radiating off him in waves, says, \u201cMaster Jason, I\u2019d thought you had quote-unquote \u2018an emergency\u2019.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTim,\u201d Dick says happily, shoving past Alfred to trap Tim in a firm hug, \u201cdid you come to help us out? We really need it. I\u2019ve never been this sweaty in my life.\u201d When he pulls back, Tim\u2019s shirt is both wet and covered in flour. </p>\n<p>Bruce, because he\u2019s Bruce, has had his eyes firmly fixed on Tim ever since he came in, and he now asks, \u201cWhat happened to your arm?\u201d</p>\n<p>Tim flinches. Jason wraps an arm around his shoulders and says, \u201cTimbo fell victim to the horrors of PE.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat did the doctor say? Did you get an X-Ray? Do you have their contact information? I\u2019m calling them,\u201d Bruce says, already standing up. He bumps into a pie in the process, which promptly falls to the floor with a big, sad splash. Bruce looks contrite. </p>\n<p>For the past few hours Tim has been half-convinced that Jason has been having some sort of mental break, and that theory only gets strengthened now. Instead of laughing like a maniac at Bruce like he normally would, Jason barely glances at the now-ruined pie. He has a determined look on his face. Tim knows, he just knows, that Jason is about to ruin everything. Jason is going to tell Bruce about his parents, and Bruce is going to misunderstand, and then he\u2019ll call CPS and it\u2019s going to be horrible because without Robin, Tim literally has nothing else going on in his life, and he\u2019s going to be trapped in a group home and nobody is going to adopt him because nobody wants to adopt a fifteen-year-old, and he\u2019s going to get into drugs and die under a bridge before he\u2019s eighteen, and it\u2019s all because of one stupid broken arm.</p>\n<p>\u201cBruce, I have to tell you something,\u201d Jason says. Tim\u2019s breath hitches. Any second now, he thinks.</p>\n<p>But Bruce isn\u2019t watching Jason. He\u2019s still watching Tim. </p>\n<p>\u201cTim,\u201d he says, quiet but firm, \u201ccome with me. Let\u2019s have a talk in my office.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBruce,\u201d Jason protests, \u201cyou don\u2019t have all the facts, you can\u2019t just-\u201c</p>\n<p>Bruce holds up a hand. \u201cNot now, Jason,\u201d he says. \u201cNot before I haven\u2019t talked to Tim.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut-\u201c</p>\n<p>\u201cEnough,\u201d Bruce says, sharp enough that Jason falls quiet. \u201cTim?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, sir,\u201d Tim says, hurrying to follow Bruce. It\u2019s okay, he tells himself. He knew this was going to happen. It\u2019s better this way, even. Bruce won\u2019t have to waste time on hearing Tim\u2019s sob story about being so privileged that he literally has an entire house to himself, because Tim is just not going to tell him. They can part amiably, at least.</p>\n<p>Bruce actually has two offices, one for official Wayne Enterprises business and one for private family matters. He leads Tim into the one for family now, and Tim can\u2019t help but feel slightly touched by that fact. </p>\n<p>He waits until they\u2019ve sat down, Bruce behind his desk, Tim on one of the leather chairs in front of it, but before Bruce can say anything, Tim speaks first. Quick, he thinks, like ripping off a band-aid. \u201cI need to clear out my locker in the Cave, but that\u2019s it. All my case files are up to date, so you should be able to follow those notes easily. I can be out of here in twenty- no, thirty minutes,\u201d he corrects, thinking of his bandaged arm. It\u2019s better to be thought of as slow than to set unreasonable expectations from the start. Still, there is one thing \u2013 \u201cDo you think maybe I could come over every once in a while? Not long enough to be a bother, you don\u2019t even have to be here. I just think it would be kind of cool to talk to Dick and Jason sometimes.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTim,\u201d Bruce says, causing Tim to fall silent. \u201cI want you to know that I respect your privacy, which is why before today, I have not looked at your file more than necessary. However, due to some worrying texts I have received earlier today, I decided to do a little research.\u201d</p>\n<p>A little research, Tim thinks. Oh no. No, no, no, no-</p>\n<p>\u201cThese are the facts,\u201d Bruce says, still calm, his massive palms spread openly out on the desk like he wants to show Tim that he has nothing to hide. \u201cYour parents are currently in South Africa. Your housekeeper comes twice a week while you\u2019re in school, a gardening service comes once a month to take care of the grounds. You have no other relatives besides a great-aunt, who is currently in a nursing home in Minnesota. Every day, the only person in that house is you. Have I missed something?\u201d</p>\n<p>Tim looks down at his hands and shakes his head. \u201cYou weren\u2019t supposed to notice,\u201d he mutters. \u201cI only became Robin to help you get better. You had enough to worry about, I didn\u2019t want to add to that.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cA noble intention at the time,\u201d Bruce says lightly. \u201cAnd what about now? Do you still think I have enough to worry about now?\u201d</p>\n<p>Tim hesitates, takes a moment to really think about it. Dick\u2019s and Bruce\u2019s relationship is mostly recovered. Jason has returned from the dead, and while he still fights with Bruce on a regular basis, it's obvious to Tim that this, too, is just a matter of time. There are no major crises right now, no alien invasions, and Bruce has so much time on his hands right now that he went golfing with Clark last week. Objectively, this is probably the least worried Bruce has been in years.</p>\n<p>But that still doesn\u2019t mean Tim is Bruce\u2019s problem. </p>\n<p>Bruce must take Tim\u2019s silence as answer enough, because he smiles, though it looks pained more than anything. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he says, and that simple sentence is enough to make Tim stare at him, wide-eyed. \u201cI\u2019m sorry that I made you think that you couldn\u2019t come to me with your troubles. You can always come to me, Tim. Always.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDoes this mean,\u201d Tim asks, immediately focusing on the only thing that matters, \u201cthat I can be Robin again once my arm is healed?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d Bruce says, simply, just like that, like Tim hasn\u2019t gone numb in relief at that one word. \u201cBut that\u2019s not what I wanted to talk to you about. There is no good way to say this, so I\u2019m just going to say it anyway. I want you to move into the Manor.\u201d</p>\n<p>And that \u2013 that doesn\u2019t make sense.</p>\n<p>\u201cBut I\u2019m not an orphan,\u201d Tim blurts out. He feels like he can\u2019t not say it. Maybe Bruce forgot about this. Maybe Bruce has him confused with someone else. </p>\n<p>But Bruce merely smiles again. \u201cI\u2019m aware. But you\u2019re an unsupervised minor, and you should have someone to watch out for you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI do,\u201d Tim says. \u201cMy parents-\u201c But Bruce already knows about his parents. \u201cMy uncle-\u201c But Bruce already knows that he has no other relatives. \u201cI can take care of myself.\u201d There. He\u2019s found his angle. Bruce appreciates self-sufficiency, and surely if he wants Tim to stay Robin, this is the most convenient route for both of them. </p>\n<p>\u201cI know you can, but-\u201c</p>\n<p>\u201cThen why can\u2019t you just let it go?\u201d Tim snaps, louder than he meant to. \u201cI come over for patrol and go home afterwards, and it\u2019s worked out like this for both of us. I always knew you didn\u2019t want another son, that you just needed a Robin and nothing else, and I never tried to be anything but that. So if you don\u2019t mind waiting for me to heal before I can patrol again, what\u2019s the problem? Why are you suddenly pretending to care?\u201d</p>\n<p>Bruce looks <em>gutted</em>. \u201cI do care. I\u2019m sorry that I let you believe that I don\u2019t. I want you as Robin, yes, but even if you told me you would never do another patrol again, I\u2019d still want you here. Not as Robin, but as someone I care about. Which is why,\u201d he says, taking Tim\u2019s hands over the desk, \u201cI want you to move in. I want all my family to be close by.\u201d</p>\n<p>\n<em>All my family.</em>\n</p>\n<p>Tim\u2019s heart skips a beat, only to start up again with increased force. It\u2019s beating so hard in his chest that he thinks Bruce must be able to hear it, and if he can\u2019t, then he must at least notice the tears that have gathered in Tim\u2019s eyes. </p>\n<p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to say anything,\u201d Bruce tells him. \u201cNot right now. What do you say we go back downstairs and watch your big brothers\u2019 ill-advised attempts at making pies?\u201d</p>\n<p>Tim, his throat choked up, manages a nod. </p>\n<p>\u201cOh, I nearly forgot,\u201d Bruce says, just as Tim is about to leave the office. \u201cI have one more question. Listen carefully, because it\u2019s of the utmost importance.\u201d When Tim turns around, his stomach in knots, Bruce is holding up a pen. \u201cMay I sign your cast?\u201d</p>\n<p>Tim smiles so widely that he thinks his cheeks must split apart.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">*</p>\n<p>When Tim finally goes back to school three days later, the SHITHEAD and the arrow are surrounded by three names, a dozen of stickers, and a clumsily drawn bat. Tim has never liked anything more.</p>"
