  "notes": "<p>Aaand this is the last part of this particular series. Just putting it out there before tomorrow 'cause I have this really bad feeling that either Steve or Eddie are gonna die.<br>It's gonna be two chapters a day or something.<br>Enjoy.</p>\n<p>I have no idea if Volume 2 is already out 'cause I'm literally in work right now, but I can't wait to see what bullshit they're gonna pull on us. In the mean time, here's Nancy POV.</p>\n<p>Well...those two episodes happened. Can't say I liked them.<br>Here's some Will POV, and I guess I'll get started on that Fix it fic I really hoped I wouldn't need.</p>\n<p>\n(See the end of the chapter for <a href=\"#chapter_6_endnotes\">notes</a>.)\n</p>\n<p>That's it for now. Thank you for reading. If I find the time and motivation, I might at some point add some more chapters from some of the other kids but for now I've got another project planned.</p>",
  "text": "<p>When his brother had died, Wayne had known it would only be a matter of time before his sister-in-law would pack her bags and skip town, which was why he'd made sure she left the baby with him instead of dragging him around the country, sleeping in dodgy motels and the back of the car. The kid deserved a stable home, if nothing else, and, by God, when he'd held little Eddie in his arms for first time, he'd sworn to protect the boy, and if it was the last thing he did. They were family. They looked out for each other.</p>\n<p>And it wasn't easy. Of course, it wasn't easy. Wayne had never expected it to be, but he did his damned best and he\u2019d liked to think that they were doing alright.</p>\n<p>When Eddie started coming home with bloodied noses and bruises, he was starting to worry. Kids could be cruel, he knew, but Eddie seemed to take it in stride, wearing his black eyes like badges of honour, and Wayne made sure they always had a well-stocked first aid kit at hand.</p>\n<p>When Eddie started dealing drugs, Wayne worried even more, remembering his brother six feet underground, but Eddie was always careful about it, never getting into too much trouble, and using the money to help out where he could.</p>\n<p>When Beverly Walker told Wayne's she'd seen Eddie kiss another guy, he wasn't even surprised, to be totally honest. Maybe he should have even expected it. Eddie had always been a little different, after all. And it wasn't an issue. Not for Wayne. So he made sure to let Eddie know that he had his back and to maybe not stick his tongue down a boys throat in plain sight in the future.</p>\n<p>When they found the dead body of a cheerleader in their trailer and all of Hawkins started a manhunt for Eddie, Wayne did not have a single doubt in his heart that Eddie was innocent because, at the end of day, Eddie was a good kid, damnit. And then Eddie disappeared over spring break, and when he came back, he was changed. He tried to hide it, sure, the same wicked smile still gracing his face, the same restless energy still filling his eyes and his heart, but Wayne could see it in the quiet moments and the way he was almost never sober anymore, and he realised that his best wasn't good enough anymore and he was losing his nephew.</p>\n<p>And then Steve fucking Harrington knocked on the door of their new trailer.</p>\n<p>\u201cCan I help you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cEr, hi, I\u2019m \u2013 uhm \u2013 is Eddie in?\u201c</p>\n<p>\u201cShop\u2019s closed.\u201d</p>\n<p>The boy blinked. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShop\u2019s closed. If you're here to buy, you better come back some other time.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, no. No, I'm not \u2013 I'm a friend.\u201d</p>\n<p>It took a lot to not laugh, to not show any reaction, to not slam the door in the boy\u2019s face because who the hell did he think he was, anyway? And lying to Wayne\u2019s face about it, too?</p>\n<p>\u201cHe's through there.\u201d</p>\n<p>As much as Wayne hated to admit it, but Eddie got better afterwards. He no longer spent night and day in his trailer, no longer got high on his own supply, no longer stared into the middle distance as much as he had before, and Wayne was glad. He was. If having Steve Harrington in his trailer every once in a while, was the price for his nephew to be happy again, Wayne was more than willing to pay it.</p>\n<p>And the thing was, he seemed to be having Steve Harrington in his trailer a lot these days.</p>\n<p>\u201cDidn't realise you were friends,\u201d he said to Eddie one day after Steve had left.</p>\n<p>Eddie shrugged, holding two beer cans in his hands and throwing one to Wayne. \u201cWe weren't. Now we are,\u201d he answered, opening his can. \u201cIf that's alright with you, old man,\u201d he added with a teasing smile, and Wayne raised his hands in surrender.</p>\n<p>\u201cAs long as you know what you're doing.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDon't worry about me,\u201d said Eddie, walking over to the couch.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat's my job, boy.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGet a different job, then.\u201d</p>\n<p>And Wayne wasn't blind or anything, he could see what was happening here, could see the crush the size of Empire State Building Eddie was harbouring for this boy and his ridiculous hair, and he was worried because that was his job but also because he didn't want to see Eddie get hurt.</p>\n<p>But he didn't say anything because it wasn't his place and he trusted Eddie to be smart about this and so instead Wayne kept his eyes and ears open and made sure to be there in case Eddie needed him.</p>\n<p>It was just another regular day when Harrington came by once again. Eddie had been shutting himself off in his room all day, and Wayne had started to think that, maybe, something had happened the previous night, and when he saw the slightly crazed look on Harrington's face, he was almost certain about it.</p>\n<p>\u201cEr. Hi. Is \u2013\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIn his room,\u201d Wayne answered before Harrington could even finish his question, stepping aside to let the boy in, \u201cYou know the way.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harrington stepped inside, nodding in thanks at Wayne before knocking on Eddies door, and Wayne almost expected his boy to not answer, but he did.</p>\n<p>\u201cCome in!\u201d</p>\n<p>Steve pushed open the door and Wayne sat back down in his armchair, watching through the reflection in the mirror on the wall as Eddie appeared, his eyes wide in surprise.</p>\n<p>\u201cHi,\u201d Harrington said awkwardly, and Wayne raised the volume on the TV, if only to give the boys some semblance of privacy, but not enough to miss Eddie\u2019s next words.</p>\n<p>\u201cNot gonna lie, I didn't think I'd see you again any time soon.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah. Well.\u201d Harrington cleared his throat. \u201cCan I come in?\u201d</p>\n<p>And then the door to Eddie\u2019s room closed and Wayne was left with the sound of the news he didn\u2019t even want to watch.</p>\n<p>Not that it did much. The paper-thin walls of the trailer weren't exactly made for being soundproof, and as much as Wayne tried not to listen, he couldn't help but catch the occasional snippets of their conversation. Enough to piece together what was going on.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, okay?\u201d Harrington\u2019s voice sounded through to him, \u201cI freaked out. I\u2019m still kinda freaking out!\u201d</p>\n<p>It didn\u2019t take a genius to figure out, and as much as Wayne believed that Eddie could hold his own, he was getting ready to jump in and do whatever he needed to do. Just in case.</p>\n<p>But nothing happened.</p>\n<p>Their voices lowered, became calmer. There was no sound of fighting, no sound of a struggle, no sound of anything but a civilised conversation.</p>\n<p>Wayne strained his ears, trying not to feel too guilty about it. He was just looking out for his nephew, after all. But there was no sound coming from Eddie's room.</p>\n<p>And so Wayne waited.</p>\n<p>When Eddie's door finally opened again and his nephew emerged, heading straight for the fridge, Wayne had to keep himself from staring. Looking at Eddie, it was quite obvious just what they'd been doing in there, if the messy hair and rumpled shirt and swollen lips were anything to go by. Eddie, himself, seemed equally set on not acknowledging his uncle.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo. Steve Harrington, huh?\u201d Wayne's asked, unable to hold his tongue for much longer.</p>\n<p>Eddie paused for a second, crouched in front of the fridge. \u201cYeah,\u201d he said softly, retrieving two beers and straightening up.</p>\n<p>\u201cMake sure he treats you right.\u201d He didn't trust that Harrington kid, truth be told.</p>\n<p>\u201cDon't worry about me,\u201d Eddie told him, turning around, leaning back against the fridge.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt's my \u2013\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cJob. I know.\u201d Eddie pushed off the fridge and crossed his arms, stepping a little closer to Wayne. \u201cI'm fine.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wayne took a moment too look at the boy. He did seem fine. There was a glint in his eyes that had been missing for a long time now, Wayne had almost forgotten what it had looked like. Not that he would say that, of course.</p>\n<p>\u201cShould you leave your boy waiting like this?\u201d he grumbled instead, turning back to the TV and almost expecting Eddie to leave. He didn't.</p>\n<p>\u201cIs this gonna be a problem?\u201d</p>\n<p>Frowning, Wayne looked back at Eddie. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThis.\u201d Eddie gestured back at his room. \u201cSteve. Me. Steve with me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI already told you, I don't give two shits about \u2013\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI know,\u201d Eddie cut him off, \u201cBut it's one thing to vaguely know that I get with guys when I'm out, and another thing all together to have it happen in literally the next room.\u201d</p>\n<p>Every once in a while, Wayne was taken by surprise at the guts Eddie had. There was zero fear in his face, zero shame. He wasn't trying to skirt around the topic, and Wayne appreciated that.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell then let me tell you again, a little clearer this time, that I don't care what you get up to with your boyfriend, or whatever he is. In fact, I'd rather you do it here, where it's safe, than out there where God knows what can happen. Understood?\u201d</p>\n<p>Eddie regarded him for a moment before nodding his head. \u201cUnderstood,\u201d he said, \u201cThanks.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wayne waved his hand dismissively and, this time, Eddie did turn to go back to his room, bringing the beers with him.</p>\n<p>Wayne still wasn't quite sold on Harrington, but he meant what he'd said. As long as Eddie was happy and safe, Wayne was doing his job. In fact, it didn't even matter what he thought of Harrington, because this wasn't about him. This was about Eddie. This was about protecting his nephew. His family.</p>\n<p>It wasn't until a few weeks later that Wayne thought, maybe, he'd gotten it all wrong.</p>\n<p>He was coming home late, his body aching from the day, and he was almost surprised to see the faint light seeping through the cracks of the drawn blinds of the trailer, even more surprised to find Eddie and Harrington sitting on the couch together, Harrington leaning against Eddie's chest, craning his neck a little to smile at the other boy, their legs and hands entwined. Wayne didn't miss the way Harrington froze and tensed up when Wayne entered, the way his fingers twitched but he didn't pull away, the way his eyes grew wide as he stared up at Wayne.</p>\n<p>\u201cBoys,\u201d he greeted them.</p>\n<p>There was real fear I'm Harrington's face, as if he was only waiting for something to happen.</p>\n<p>\u201cRelax,\u201d Eddie muttered into his ear, still loud enough for Wayne to hear, \u201cHe's cool.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, don't mind me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harrington did relax a little, a least, though his eyes were still trailing Wayne as he made his way to the fridge for some beer.</p>\n<p>\u201cNeed us to clear out?\u201d Eddie asked.</p>\n<p>\u201cNah. You stay where you are if you don't mind me joining in.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cKnock yourself out, old man.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wayne took the old armchair, groaning a little as he settled into the cushions and opened the beer with a satisfying hiss. Eddie clearly didn't care that he was there, going back to playing with Harrington's hair, but the same couldn't be said about Harrington, and as much as Wayne still had his reservations about the boy, he couldn't stand the deer-caught-in-the-headlights look he had going on.</p>\n<p>\u201cRelax, son,\u201d he said, taking a swig from his beer, \u201cAin't got nothing to fear from me.\u201d</p>\n<p>He didn't know this boy, obviously. Not really. But he had met Harrington Senior a couple times, enough to know that he wasn't exactly a pleasant person which mean he probably wasn't a pleasant father either and, goddamn it all, but this kid probably didn't even know better than to be scared for his life and ready to make a quick exit if need be.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIn fact,\u201d Wayne tagged on with a little sigh, \u201cOur door\u2019s always open for ya, alright? If you ever need a safe place to stay, or somethin\u2019.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harrington's eyes grew a little wider but some of the fear receded, while Eddie shot Wayne a glance that was somewhere between grateful and frustrated.</p>\n<p>Harrington cleared his throat. \u201cRight. Thanks. Mr. Munson,\u201d he said, a little unsteady, and grimaced at himself.</p>\n<p>Wayne rolled his eyes. \u201cJust call me Wayne like everyone else.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cRight.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wayne went back to sipping his beer and trying not to be too obvious about watching the two boys.</p>\n<p>Eddie started talking about a new campaign he'd planned for his club, his hands moving animatedly, and his face lit up in joy, and Harrington listened. It was quite obvious that he knew little about D&amp;D but there was a fond smile on his face and he made sure to ask questions at just the right moments, keeping Eddie talking, and the more he did, the more Harrington relaxed, the more Wayne realised that maybe, just maybe, he'd been wrong about the boy. They looked comfortable like this. Familiar. And more importantly, Eddie looked really and truly happy. And whatever made Eddie happy was good enough for Wayne.</p>\n<p>He left the boys to it, in the end, sitting on the couch and bickering in low voices, while he turned in for the night, but he did think, just before he closed his eyes and fell asleep, that he might be coming around to Harrington after all.</p>\n<p>Dustin wasn\u2019t jealous.</p>\n<p>For almost a year he\u2019d managed to keep both Steve and Eddie all to himself and separate from each other, thank you very much, because Steve and Eddie would never get along, would never find common ground, were so fundamentally different like day and night and could never, under any circumstances, exist in the same realm.</p>\n<p>And then Chrissy Cunningham dies.</p>\n<p>And then Eddie was on the run from the law and an angry mob.</p>\n<p>And then Steve and Eddie and Nancy and Robin got trapped in the Upside Down.</p>\n<p>And then they defeated Vecna and sealed off the Upside Down once and for all.</p>\n<p>And <em>now</em> Steve and Eddie were apparently attached at the hip.</p>\n<p>And Dustin wasn\u2019t jealous. There was nothing to be jealous of. It was perfectly normal for them to want to be friends with someone their own age, someone they could smoke and drink and party with, someone they could talk about boring adult stuff with. In other words, someone who wasn\u2019t Dustin.</p>\n<p>It wasn\u2019t that Steve and Eddie had friends other than Dustin that was the problem here. Steve had been friends with Robin for a while now and Dustin <em>liked</em> Robin, and Eddie had his band and they all seemed pretty cool. No, it was that Steve and Eddie were now apparently <em>each</em> <em>other\u2019s </em>best friend and they\u2019d forgotten all about Dustin in the process.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Family Video, this is Steve, how can I help you?</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSteve!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Henderson!</em>\u201d Steve asked, sounding actually happy to hear from him for once, \u201c<em>What\u2019s up, man?</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou. Me. Cinema. Tonight. 6:30.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Aww, man, I\u2019m sorry, I can\u2019t,</em>\u201d said Steve, sounding genuinely sorry, but at this point Dustin didn\u2019t even care anymore, because this had been the fifth time in two weeks that Steve had blown him off.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat? Why?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>I\u2019m hanging with Eddie.</em>\u201d</p>\n<p><em>Of course you are</em>, Dustin thought bitterly.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo? He can come too.\u201d</p>\n<p>Steve let out a laugh and Dustin wasn\u2019t sure if it was the connection, but it had sounded slightly hysterical. \u201c<em>Yeah, no, that\u2019s not happening, short stuff</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Because it just isn\u2019t, okay?</em>\u201d Steve snapped, \u201c<em>Some other day. Not tonight.</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCome one, Steve \u2013\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Look, I\u2019m sorry, okay? I can give you a lift if you wanna go with someone else, but I can\u2019t stay.</em>\u201d It sounded oddly final. Dustin was usually very good at making Steve agree to anything he wanted but something told him that that wouldn\u2019t be happening here, and he didn\u2019t understand why.</p>\n<p>\u201cFine,\u201d he snapped, \u201cBut don\u2019t bother coming to me the next time you wanna cry about your lack of a dating life because I\u2019ll be busy. I can\u2019t tell you what I\u2019ll be busy with. But I\u2019ll be busy.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Oh, come on, man, don\u2019t \u2013</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHave a nice day, Steve.\u201d Dustin slammed the receiver down, nearly breaking the damn thing, and huffed. \u201cSome other day, not tonight,\u201d he grumbled in his best Steve impression, \u201cWell, screw you too, Harrington!\u201d</p>\n<p>He ended up staying home that night, angrily leafing through several comic books at once, but not even Captain America could cheer him up.</p>\n<p>And it kept happening, was the thing.</p>\n<p>\u201cSorry, can someone else drive you to the arcade? I\u2019ve got a. Thing.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSorry I\u2019m late, Eddie and I lost track of time.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSorry I couldn\u2019t be there, Eddie and I got drunk last night. Next time, though, eh?\u201d</p>\n<p>And it wasn\u2019t like <em>Eddie</em> was any better. There had been little things, at first \u2013 He stopped hanging out with them as much after their campaigns, he started telling Dustin to please stop coming to the trailer unannounced, he gave the same lame-ass excused for why he couldn\u2019t spend time with Dustin on that particular day \u2013 and <em>then</em> he cancelled D&amp;D night.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou can\u2019t <em>cancel</em> D&amp;D!\u201d he all but shouted.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s just the once,\u201d Eddie explained calmly, \u201cWe\u2019ll reschedule for the week after and we can make it a double session, alright? But this is important.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat could possibly be so important that you have to reschedule our campaign?\u201d</p>\n<p>Eddie opened his mouth as if to answer before stopping himself, his fingers fiddling with the rings on his hand. \u201cI can\u2019t tell you right now.\u201d And that was the end of that particular conversation.</p>\n<p>The worst part was that the others didn\u2019t even seem to notice. Or if they did, they simply didn\u2019t care.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a big deal,\u201d Mike had said with a shrug, and Lucas had agreed.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, Dustin, relax. It\u2019s just a game.\u201d</p>\n<p>Except it wasn\u2019t about the stupid game, was it? It was about <em>Eddie</em> and <em>Steve</em> no longer wanting to spend time <em>Dustin</em>. And he didn\u2019t understand why, didn\u2019t understand what he\u2019d done wrong, what had made them hate him like this. He was very aware that he could be a little loud, sometimes, a little rude, even. Annoying, probably. But he\u2019d always thought that Steve and Eddie <em>liked</em> those things about him.</p>\n<p>Apparently not.</p>\n<p>So when the night of the cancelled D&amp;D session rolled around, Dustin told his friends that he wouldn\u2019t be coming to their sleepover in Mike\u2019s basement and instead decided to go and see what Eddie was getting up to, lying in wait outside the trailer.</p>\n<p>He didn\u2019t have to wait for long.</p>\n<p>A painfully familiar BMW rolled down the dirt track and stopped next to Eddie\u2019s beat-up van, and out stepped stupid fucking Steve Harrington, with his stupid fucking hair, and his stupid fucking polo shirt, and Dustin wanted to scream. Of <em>course</em>, Eddie had blown them off for Steve. Of fucking course. Dustin wasn\u2019t even sure anymore why it surprised him. It really shouldn\u2019t. And even though he\u2019d initially wanted to, Dustin couldn\u2019t sit around and watch as his two best friends had a better time with each other than with him, so he left, and when he got home, he did scream, the sound muffled by his pillow, and if his eyes were a little puffy and red afterwards, no one had to know.</p>\n<p>Dustin did not show up to the rescheduled campaign.</p>\n<p>Dustin did not go to the next movie night.</p>\n<p>Dustin stopped calling Steve at the store.</p>\n<p>And it was fine. Everything was fine. Dustin was minding his own business, he was not sulking, he was not moping, and he was <em>not</em> jealous.</p>\n<p>\u201cDustin!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat, mum?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYour friend is here!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFriend?\u201d Dustin asked himself as he got off his bed, \u201cWhat friend?\u201d</p>\n<p>And there, leaned against his car, stood Steve, his hands buried in the pockets of his trousers and a concerned expression on his face. \u201cHey, man, you okay?\u201d</p>\n<p>Dustin frowned. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI came to see you, dipshit. Since you\u2019ve been avoiding me, or something.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, yeah? I wonder why.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI do wonder why, actually!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not the one whose avoiding you, Steve,\u201d Dustin snapped, \u201cYou\u2019re the one who stopped hanging out with me!\u201d</p>\n<p>Steve blinked. \u201cWhat? No, I didn\u2019t.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cEr, yes you did,\u201d Dustin argued, \u201cAnd I can take a hint, okay? I mean you could have said something, but whatever. It\u2019s fine. We\u2019re cool. So now go away.\u201d</p>\n<p>He didn\u2019t wait around to see if Steve really would go away, instead turning to go back into the house.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey, now, wait a second!\u201d Steve called after him, \u201cHey! Don\u2019t walk away from me, Dustin!\u201d</p>\n<p>Something snapped and Dustin swiveled around \u201cI said <em>go away</em>!\u201d Dustin shouted, \u201cGo and hang out with <em>Eddie</em> like I know you want to!\u201d</p>\n<p>A few passers-by had stopped on the street to look at them, and Steve stood frozen, his eyes wide as something like realisation dawned on his face. \u201cAh, shit, man,\u201d he muttered, running a hand through his hair, \u201cLook, can you, just \u2013 can you get in the car, please?\u201d Dustin scoffed, crossing his arms. \u201cPlease?\u201d Steve said again, his eyes almost nervously flitting around. \u201cI\u2019ll explain everything, I promise, but not <em>here</em>, okay? Just get in the car.\u201d</p>\n<p>Dustin kept his arms firmly crossed over his chest and wanted nothing more than to say no, except he really didn\u2019t, because what he wanted was to get his friend back.</p>\n<p>\u201cFine,\u201d he huffed, walking around to the passenger door and getting in.</p>\n<p>Steve started the engine, lowering the volume of the radio. He\u2019d been listening to Accept of all things and Dustin nearly started screaming again because <em>Steve Harrington</em> did not listen to music like <em>Accept</em>.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell?\u201d he prompted after a few minutes, \u201cAre you gonna talk, or what?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m working up to it, alright?\u201d Steve snapped, his hands gripping the steering wheel like a lifeline, his knuckles white.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s there to work up to? You replaced me with Eddie. It\u2019s fine.\u201d</p>\n<p>It wasn\u2019t fine.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s not \u2013 it\u2019s not what you think, okay?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThen what is it?\u201d Dustin demanded, turning in his seat to look at Steve properly, and Steve \u2013 Steve started laughing. \u201cWhat\u2019s so funny?\u201d</p>\n<p>Steve was laughing, definitely a little hysterical this time, his eyes wide and crazed. \u201cI can\u2019t believe this is my life.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah. Well. You and me both,\u201d Dustin muttered. He did feel a little calmer now, though, because Steve was clearly going through something here. Or maybe he had finally lost his mind.</p>\n<p>Steve kept driving and the music kept playing and then Steve stopped driving and the music stopped playing and they were in the middle of nowhere and Steve was still white-knuckling the wheel and Dustin was starting to get seriously worried. But he waited.</p>\n<p>\u201cAlright,\u201d said Steve, releasing a deep breath and the tension in his shoulders all at once. He let go of the wheel, reached into his pocket and pulled out a pack of cigarettes, lighting one of them. \u201cI\u2019ve worked up to it,\u201d he announced.</p>\n<p>\u201cGreat.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry I haven\u2019t been there, Dustin. I really am.\u201d He sounded sorry, his eyes meeting and holding Dustin\u2019s gaze, and Dustin almost felt a little guilty for shouting at him. \u201cBut I haven\u2019t replaced you, okay?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThen why won\u2019t you hang out with me anymore? Why won\u2019t Eddie?\u201d Dustin asked, \u201cLike, I get that I\u2019m younger than you, and maybe that\u2019s boring, or whatever, but you didn\u2019t care about that before, so I don\u2019t understand why you care now, and if you did, I don\u2019t understand why you couldn\u2019t just tell me, instead of ignoring me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Steve was still looking at him, a series of emotions flickering over his face before settling on regret, and he took a long drag from his cigarette, waving the smoke away with his hand.</p>\n<p>\u201cEddie and I are dating.\u201d</p>\n<p>Dustin blinked. Once. Twice. Three times. \u201cWhat.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cEddie and I are dating.\u201d<br>\u201cSee, I thought that\u2019s what you said.\u201d Not that it had made any more sense the second time around. \u201cWhen the hell did this happen?\u201d</p>\n<p>Steve\u2019s hand was trembling ever so slightly as he brought his smoke back up to his lips, his face now turned straight ahead. \u201cCouple weeks ago.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cA couple <em>weeks</em>?\u201d Dustin asked, his voice rising a few octaves higher than he thought it could. \u201cAnd I\u2019m only hearing about this now?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes. Alright? Don\u2019t be a dick about,\u201d Steve said defensively, \u201cWe\u2019re still figuring things out and we just wanted some time to ourselves to do that, and I didn\u2019t even think I was \u2013 I didn\u2019t think I could \u2013 <em>that</em> \u2013 and we\u2019re dating, and you are literally the first person I\u2019m telling about this, okay? Kind of, anyway. Eddie knows, obviously. And Robin, \u2018cause she helped me figure some stuff out. And I think Eddie\u2019s uncle might know \u2018cause he keeps giving me these <em>looks</em>, but that\u2019s not the point. The <em>point</em> is, you are my friend, you annoying little shit, and as my friend, I am telling you that I \u2013 you know.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat you have a boyfriend,\u201d Dustin slowly filled in the blank, and Steve nodded.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat I have a boyfriend,\u201d he repeated, and now Dustin felt like a right ass because it wasn\u2019t just Steve\u2019s hand that was shaking but his voice as well.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry I yelled at you,\u201d he said, \u201cI guess I was just \u2013 I guess I was just jealous. I thought you\u2019d replaced me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Steve glanced at him. \u201cHenderson, it is literally impossible to replace you,\u201d he said, looking and sounding a lot calmer now as he finished his cigarette, an almost-smile on his face. \u201cSo,\u201d he drawled out, \u201cWe\u2019re good?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Dustin nodded. \u201cWe\u2019re good.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGood.\u201d Steve started the car back up. The music made sense now, Dustin thought. \u201cHey, er, I was gonna swing by Eddie\u2019s, if you \u2013 if you wanna hang out with us?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou sure?\u201d Dustin asked, feeling a little self-conscious suddenly, but Steve rolled his eyes.</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2019Course I\u2019m sure,\u201d he answered, pulling onto the road and driving back towards Hawkins, \u201cHe missed you, too, you know.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGuess I owe him an apology.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGuess you do.\u201d</p>\n<p>They arrived at Eddie\u2019s trailer and the self-consciousness had transformed into actual nerves that made Dustin bite his lower lip. What if Eddie was actually angry with him? What if he\u2019d messed up and lost one of the best friends he\u2019d ever had? What if Eddie threw him out of the Party for not going to their last campaign? What if \u2013</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, well, well. Look what the cat dragged in.\u201d Eddie was lounging on the couch, his hair pulled up in a bun, wearing a worn-out Black Sabbath t-shirt with the sleeves cut off, and a sharp expression on his face. \u201cYou better be crawling on your knees, begging for forgiveness, if you wanna play D&amp;D with us again, Henderson.\u201d</p>\n<p>Dustin froze where he stood while Steve walked past him and sat down close next to Eddie.</p>\n<p>\u201cCut him some slack, Eddie,\u201d he said, \u201cKid was upset, people do stupid shit when they\u2019re upset.\u201d</p>\n<p>Some of the hard edges on Eddie\u2019s face softened, his eyes widening. \u201cDid something happen?\u201d he asked, leaning forward as if he was ready to jump into action.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Dustin answered, \u201cBut I thought it did. I was wrong. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d It wasn\u2019t much of an explanation, and Eddie questioningly looked back and forth between Dustin and Steve, waiting for either to elaborate. So, Dustin did, \u201cSteve told me you\u2019re dating,\u201d he said, not missing the flash of surprise on Eddie\u2019s face, \u201cWhich is cool, obviously, but I was jealous because you both kinda stopped hanging it with me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Understanding dawned on Eddie\u2019s face, quickly morphing into his usual self-assured and slightly amused grin. \u201cWell, we can\u2019t have our child, our own flesh and blood, thinking his parents abandoned him, can we Lord Harrington?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe really can\u2019t, Sir Munson,\u201d Steve played along, and Dustin thought he may have accidentally entered a whole other alternate dimension of reality, but then Steve slid up the couch to make space between himself and Eddie and patted the cushions and Dustin stopped caring if this was Hawkins or the Leftside Right.</p>\n<p>\u201cTake a seat, Henderson,\u201d said Eddie, \u201cWe\u2019ll watch whatever movie you want.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cEven an R-rated horror movie?\u201d Dustin asked, sitting down between the two older boys.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, no, come guys \u2013\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cEven an R-rated horror movie,\u201d Eddie confirmed with no regard to Steve\u2019s protests.</p>\n<p>They did not end up watching a horror movie but the Life of Brian and Dustin didn\u2019t even pay that much attention to the film anyway, too busy noticing Steve and Eddie holding hands behind his head and the way they were sharing a single can of Coke for some reason instead of just getting two. That was okay, though. He\u2019d seen it before, after all, and he got to spent time with his two best friends again because, as it turned out, there had never been anything to be jealous of.</p>\n<p>As much as Nancy hated to admit it, but learning that both Robin and Eddie were gay came as a surprise. Even more of a surprise was that Steve had apparently known about it and not cared. She was certain that the Steve she\u2019d known back in school, the Steve she\u2019d dated, would have had a very different reaction. Watching them now, though, all three sharing a beanbag in her basement, whispering and giggling and teasing each other, it suddenly hit her just how much Steve had changed. Sure, she'd seen it happening over the last few years, had seen the way he was with the kids, the way he was always there protecting the people around him, the first to jump in front of the bullet, but somehow it hadn't quite clicked until now. Steve was a different person. A good person.</p>\n<p>It made her a little sad, in a way. Made her wish they could try again, maybe. But that wouldn't happen, she knew. They'd both moved on.</p>\n<p>But she still couldn't quite shake the intrigue in this new Steve.</p>\n<p>Watching him with Robin had filled her with a strange, rather irrational jealousy for reasons she couldn't explain. So sure had she been that they were secretly dating and simply not telling anyone about it. Looking at them now, Nancy had no idea how she could have ever thought something so outlandish. It was clear that they loved each other, sure, the same way Steve loved all the kids, the same way she loved Mike. It was a familial love, a deep-running, unconditional loyalty born out of shared trauma and too many sleepless nights. Platonic, with a capital P.</p>\n<p>Eddie, though. Eddie was different. Of course, he was different, he was Eddie Munson. Nancy felt for him, really. Being pulled into their world of monsters and world-ending catastrophes, on top of being the main suspect for a murder he hadn't committed must have been terrible, and yet he\u2019d stayed by their side and not left since.\u00a0</p>\n<p>But Eddie was also <em>different</em>. Different with Steve. Nancy almost thought she was imagining it at first, but no. Eddie was flirting with Steve, Nancy was almost certain. His eyes crinkled in the corners and his smile turned just a little softer whenever he thought no one was looking and his eyes were trailing Steve wherever he went and his voice lilted just a little bit.</p>\n<p>And the thing was, Steve didn't seem to care.</p>\n<p>Quite the opposite actually.</p>\n<p>Steve looked comfortable around Eddie, more comfortable than she'd seen him around anyone else, except for Robin, maybe, but it wasn't the same. Where Steve and Robin endlessly teased each other and apparently voiced their affections through insults, Nancy could have sworn she\u2019d caught Steve blushing more than once after Eddie had called him honey or darling or sweetheart again, could have sworn she'd seen his eyes linger, could have sworn shed heard a familiar drawl to his words when talking to Eddie, the same drawl he'd had when talking to <em>her</em>. Back when.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Had anyone told Nancy even just a few months ago that Steve Harrington \u2013 high school sweetheart, prom king, certified ladies man \u2013 had a crush on Eddie Munson, she would have laughed. Now, however, she wasn't so sure anymore. Because Steve was a different person, and when Eddie put his arm around him, Steve didn't move back like she might have expected him to but leaned into it, and when Eddie smiled at him, Steve smiled back in a way that was familiar because she remembered him smiling at <em>her</em> like that, and when\u00a0Eddie leaned in just a little too close than was strictly necessary, Steve got a little flustered and his eyes dropped down to Eddie\u2019s lips, just for a second.</p>\n<p>It was another movie night. They\u2019d just finished Superman and were just debating between Indiana Jones and Ghost Busters as their second movie, when Nancy saw Steve getting up from his spot on the floor, loudly asking if anyone wanted more drinks or snacks.</p>\n<p>\u201cMore popcorn, please!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCan we get some chocolate?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd water. I want water.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWater? What is wrong with you?\u201d</p>\n<p>Steve gave the kids an exasperated look but didn\u2019t complain when he went upstairs, and Nancy decided to give him a hand.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re good with them, you know. The kids,\u201d she said when she\u2019d caught up to him at the top of the stairs.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m spoiling them, is what I\u2019m doing,\u201d Steve replied, but there was nothing but fondness in his voice.</p>\n<p>They passed her dad on the way to kitchen who didn\u2019t even look up from behind his newspaper.</p>\n<p>\u201cHow are you doing?\u201d Nancy asked quietly, reaching into the fridge for some drinks while Steve got started on the popcorn.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m fine, I guess. You know how it is.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah. Yeah, I know.\u201d Going through deeply traumatic events several times in a span of just a few short years left a mark, and Nancy would be lying if she didn\u2019t feel it on herself every single day. \u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re not dealing with it on your own.\u201d</p>\n<p>Steve glanced at her over his shoulder, his eyes almost calculating. \u201cYou too,\u201d he said slowly, and Nancy nearly laughed. Whatever was happening with Jonathan, she was almost sure that it wouldn\u2019t be happening for much longer, and the worst part was, she was okay with that, but that also meant she was pretty much on her own these days. Or she would be. Strangely enough, after the nightmare that was Vecna had finally come to an end, Nancy had found herself a new friend in Robin Buckley of all people. It had started slow at first, but then Nancy had offered to help the other girl study, and now they <em>friends</em>. Nancy didn\u2019t think she\u2019d had a real friend since Barb died.</p>\n<p>\u201cI think Jonathan and I are gonna break up soon,\u201d she found herself saying and Steve turned around to face her properly.</p>\n<p>\u201cSorry to hear that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, no, it\u2019s okay.\u201d Nancy shook her head. \u201cI don\u2019t even know why I\u2019m \u2013 we\u2019re still friends, right?\u201d</p>\n<p>Steve frowned, the same adorable crease forming between his eyebrows as he\u2019d had when they were still together. \u201cOf course, we\u2019re friends,\u201d he said, as if it was the most obvious thing in the world, \u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t we be?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d She actually had no idea what she was trying to do here, and she was running out of time. \u201cWe don\u2019t hang out much these days.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, sorry about that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cRobin said you guys are close now?\u201d Steve said while the popcorn behind started popping, and Nancy smiled.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe are. She\u2019s great.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShe <em>is</em> great,\u201d Steve agreed, \u201cDon\u2019t know where I\u2019d be without her, most days.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI was jealous, you know,\u201d Nancy confessed, hating how her cheeks started to feel hot.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat \u2013 of Robin?\u201d Steve asked incredulously.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, what was I supposed to think, Steve? There\u2019s suddenly this really pretty girl around you all the time and you\u2019re practically attached at the hip.\u201d</p>\n<p>Steve was laughing and shaking his head. \u201cWell, I\u2019m definitely not her type.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes. I know that <em>now</em>,\u201d said Nancy, trying and failing to hold back her own smile. \u201cI think it\u2019s really cool, by the way,\u201d she continued, \u201cHow you support her. And Eddie.\u201d</p>\n<p>There was something in Steve\u2019s eyes, like guilt and alarm and protectiveness, that almost confirmed her theory. Almost. It was gone before she could look at it too closely, and then Steve had his back turned to her completely.</p>\n<p>\u201cEddie\u2019s great, too,\u201d he muttered at the kitchen counter.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe is,\u201d Nancy agreed softly.</p>\n<p>The popcorn was almost done now.</p>\n<p>Making a decision, stepped up next to Steve and leaned closer until she could see his face again. \u201cI think you two are good together,\u201d she told him, looking out for his reaction, any reaction. Waiting for the denial, maybe, but it never came. Instead, Steve\u2019s eyes snapped to her, wide and surprised and a little terrified, before that, too, passed, and he smiled abashedly.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou think so?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI do.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThanks, Nance.\u201d Steve poured the popcorn into a bowl and reached up into the cupboard for the chocolate Dustin had asked for. \u201cYou know,\u201d he said, meeting her gaze, \u201cYou and Robin would be good together, too.\u201d</p>\n<p>It was Nancy who stilled, Nancy who averted her gaze, Nancy who blushed just a little at his suggestion. \u201cWe\u2019re not, though.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut you could be.\u201d</p>\n<p>And it wasn\u2019t like Nancy hadn\u2019t thought about it before. Robin was beautiful and funny and brave and smart and, yeah, maybe Nancy had the teeniest tiniest crush on her, but that didn\u2019t mean anything would ever come of it.</p>\n<p>Still.</p>\n<p>\u201cI know,\u201d she whispered, looking at Steve who was looking right back at her. The two of them standing in her kitchen, getting snacks for a group of the most unlikeliest friends, this strange family they\u2019d build, talking about their respective crushes. It was ridiculous.</p>\n<p>\u201cLook at us,\u201d Nancy laughed, \u201cWho\u2019d have thought this is where we end up?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI sure didn\u2019t,\u201d Steve answered, \u201cI don\u2019t think Past-Steve would have liked it very much.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, he would have hated it,\u201d Nancy agreed, grinning at her friend, \u201cI\u2019m glad <em>you</em> don\u2019t.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMe too.\u201d Steve reached for the bowl of popcorn, presumably to bring it downstairs before the kids staged an insurrection, but Nancy held him back, just for a moment, just long enough to pull him into a crushing hug.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m happy for you, Steve,\u201d she whispered into his ear.</p>\n<p>Steve closed his arms around her, squeezing lightly. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p>\n<p>By the time they went back downstairs to the others, the kids had apparently decided on Indiana Jones, and Nancy started up the movie before sitting back down between Steve and Robin. She did see Steve subtly taking Eddie\u2019s hand in the flickering shadows of the basement, hidden by the blanket he\u2019d pulled into his lap, and smiled, glancing over at Robin. They <em>would</em> be good together, wouldn\u2019t they? She looked back over at Steve who only had eyes for Eddie, though he must have noticed her watching because he sent her a quick smile, and Nancy smiled back, and with one last, final breath, she reached out for Robin\u2019s hand.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n<span>It was weird. Despite everything, Johnathan didn't think he'd ever actually had a one-on-one conversation with Steve.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n<span>Sure, they'd saved each other and Hawkins and the world together, and something like that struck a bond between two people, and sure Steve routinely played chauffeur to the kids including Will now that they'd moved back, and sure every once in a while they both had to wait together outside the arcade or the cinema or the school or Eddie Munson\u2019s trailer for their respective charges to come out and they exchanged meaningless pleasantries, but there had never, not once, been an actual conversation. Part of it was Johnathan\u2019s fault, of course. He had no idea what the protocol was for dealing with his maybe ex-girlfriend\u2019s ex-boyfriend.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n<span>And he might have even left it that way, if it hadn't been for Will offering up their house for a D&amp;D session. Since it was the summer and the school was closed, they\u2019d been circling through everyone's houses to play, occasionally even getting Steve to agree to being the host, but this was the first time that it was at their house since both mum and Hopper were out on a date or something.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n<span>It had started off quite normal.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n<span>Eddie had shown up with Max and Lucas, helping Will set up in the living room, and then Steve had arrived with Dustin and Mike, and <em>then</em> Steve had stayed. For some reason Steve had stayed and settled on the couch in the back and taken out some magazine and a Walkman and looked quite content being there for the next who knew how many hours. And that's when Johnathan had realised that he'd never really spend any time alone with Steve before. Not that they were alone now, really, but that was beside the point.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n<span>Johnathan played host, making sure the kids ate something and drank enough water while Eddie spun his tale about a knight looking for her son, the room hanging onto his every word, and Johnathan had to admit that he was good at this. Telling stories. Even Steve seemed enraptured, having lowered his magazine and taken off his headphones, staring at Eddie from across the room, a strange expression on his face \u2013 soft and fond in a way Johnathan hadn't seen before, in a way he hadn't thought Steve was even capable of. Because, yes, somehow Steve had turned into the designated babysitter \u2013 and the when and how and why of that particular story was still a mystery to him \u2013 but they were literally kids, little children, or at least had been when everything had started, so maybe that made a little sense, and yes, Steve kept helping them when he really didn't have to, when he could have simply gotten into his car that first time and left Nancy and him to die, and yes, Steve was less of an asshole these days but Johnathan supposed that was simply a side effect of being dethroned and slipping all the way to the bottom of the social food chain which was bound to teach anyone at least a little humility. But Johnathan had never expected to think of Steve as <em>sweet</em> and yet here he was, smiling and laughing at Eddie and his jokes, and during a little fife minute bathroom break he heard Steve tell Eddie how good of a job he was doing, and it was <em>weird</em>. It wasn't like Johnathan hated Steve or anything, hadn't hated him in a long time, but not-hating someone and liking them were two completely different things and, frankly, he wasn't sure what the hell he was supposed to do with that.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n<span>\u201cSteve stop flirting with Eddie,\u00a0we need to keep going,\u201d Dustin called out, blunt and a little rude as ever, and Johnathan would have expected Steve to protest but he didn't, simply rolled his eyes and grumbled something about how the kid should get his attitude checked, before casually reaching into the inside pocket of Eddie's leather jacket he was still wearing and pulling out a pack of cigarettes.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n<span>\u201cHave fun,\u201d he told the older boy, \u201cNerd.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n<span>\u201cOh, I will,\u201d Eddie replied, \u201cJock.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n<span>And Johnathan just didn't get it, so when Steve went to sit outside on the porch for a smoke, Johnathan decided to follow him.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n<span>\u201cHey.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n<span>Steve turned his head, nodding in greeting. \u201cWant one?\u201d he asked, offering up the cigs.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n<span>Johnathan shrugged. \u201cSure, why not.\u201d He sat down, accepting the smoke and lighter from Steve. \u201cYou don't have to wait here, you know,\u201d he found himself saying, just to get rid of the strange silence between them, \u201cWe can figure out how to get the kids back later.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n<span>Steve glanced over at him, cigarette dangling from his lips. \u201cI don't mind.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n<em>\n<span>Why?</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n<span>\u201cI never apologised, you know.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n<span>\u201cWhat for?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n<span>Steve patted off the ashes of his cigarette. \u201cBeing such a dick,\u201d he answered, \u201cI was horrible. Made your life miserable. Tried to kick your ass. Badly.\u201d Johnathan chuckled lightly. \u201cNot sorry about breaking your camera, though,\u201d Steve added, taking another drag, \u201cThat shit was not cool, man.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n<span>\u201cI know,\u201d Johnathan agreed, \u201cI shouldn't have done that.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n<span>\u201cYou really shouldn't have.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n<span>\u201cI'm sorry, too,\u201d Johnathan said, because why the hell not. This was apparently happening. \u201cI kinda stole your girlfriend from you.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n<span>Steve shrugged. \u201cI don't think you did, to be honest. Not sure if it would have worked out, anyway.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n<span>\u201cCome on, you two were, like, <em>the</em> couple. High school sweetheart, destined to make a good life together. Or something.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n<span>Steve frowned at him. \u201cYou don't actually believe that.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n<span>\u201cWell. No. But I thought I'd try and be nice.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n<span>\u201cIt's cool, man,\u201d said Steve, \u201cShe was happy with you, right?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n<span>Johnathan shrugged. \u201cI think so?\u201d he answered though it came out more like a question. <em>Had</em> Nancy been happy with him? He couldn't even say anymore, as if the months in California and the constant worrying had somehow tainted all his memories. \u201cI think we\u2019re over now.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n<span>\u201cYeah?\u201d Steve asked, finishing his cigarette, and Johnathan nodded.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n<span>\u201cYeah.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n<span>\u201cSorry, man.\u201d He really did sound sorry.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n<span>\u201cWhat. You're not happy about that?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n<span>\u201cWha \u2013 why would I be happy about that?\u201d asked Steve sounding genuinely confused as he ground out the smoke underneath his shoe.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n<span>\u201cI thought you still had a thing for her.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n<span>\u201cWhy does everyone keep saying that?\u201d Steve threw his hands up in the air. \u201cI don't have a thing for Nancy, anymore, okay? I moved on. We both moved on.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n<span>Johnathan finished his own smoke, dropping it to the ground. \u201cAlright. Sorry. It's just, Max said \u2013\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n<span>\u201cOf fucking course she did.\u201d Steve groaned. \u201cWell, if you're willing to take my word over that of a 15-year-old, I'm not into Nancy, okay, I \u2013\u201d He ran a hand through his hair \u201c\u2014I moved on,\u201d he finished, his voice a lot softer than before, a lot gentler, a lot more meaningful, and Johnathan frowned. Was Steve seeing someone at the moment? He didn't think so. Usually, Dustin was meticulous at keeping everyone updated on Steve's disastrous love life, but he hadn't said anything in a couple weeks now, and, surely, if Steve was dating someone for that long, they'd have all heard about it by now.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n<span>\u201cAlright,\u201d said Johnathan instead of asking any of the questions swirling around in his mind, \u201cSorry to bring it up.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n<span>\u201cIt's fine. Just \u2013\u201d Steve shrugged and shook his head. \u201cIt's fine,\u201d he concluded before standing up and going back inside and Johnathan followed suit. </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n<span>The campaign was in full swing again, the kids with their heads stuck together furiously whispering strategy, and Jonathan watched as Steve walked up to Eddie and slipped the pack of cigarettes back into his inside pocket, whispering something into the other boy\u2019s ear. Eddie turned to look at Steve, a smile on his, and nodded, their eyes locked for a few long seconds and then the moment was gone and Steve sat back down on the couch, and Jonathan felt more confused than ever.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n<span>The truth was, he barely even knew Steve. He knew the person Steve used to be, but that had been years ago, and he'd clearly changed, so now that things were finally, indefinitely over, and all the gates were closed and sealed, and the Upside Down was nothing more than a bad memory and the stuff for nightmares, maybe, Jonathan thought, he should change too. And maybe he should make an effort to try and get to know this new Steve a bit more.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n<span>So make an effort, he did.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n<span>The next time they ran into each other outside the Wheeler's house, Jonathan made a point of smiling at him and asking how his week had been, how work was going, and if he had anything planned for the weekend. Steve's answers were short at best. The week had been normal, work was work, and this weekend would look like any other weekend. Still. Jonathan marked it down as progress.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n<span>\u201cIs Steve dating anyone?\u201d Was apparently his next step, the question directed at Nancy the next time he saw her.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n<span>\u201cHello to you, too,\u201d she replied curtly, her shoulders and back stiff, and Jonathan grimaced.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n<span>\u201cSorry,\u201d he muttered, \u201cHey.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n<span>\u201cWhy do you want to know about Steve?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n<span>\u201cNo reason,\u201d Jonathan answered with a shrug, \u201cJust curious, really.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n<span>Nancy hummed, her eyes regarding his face as if she was looking for something. \u201cMaybe you should ask, Steve, then.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n<span>\u201cWell yes,\u201d Jonathan agreed reluctantly, \u201cBut I'm asking <em>you</em>.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n<span>\u201cAnd I can't answer you.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n<span>Jonathan knew Nancy. Sure, things had been a little awkward since he'd moved back to Hawkins and they hadn't talked about their steadily fading relationship yet, but Jonathan <em>knew</em> Nancy. And he knew when she was keeping secrets.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n<span>\u201cYou're not back together, are you?\u201d he asked despite himself, mostly because it was the only logical explanation. Why else would Nancy not tell him?</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n<span>\u201cWhat?\u201d Nancy looked at him incredulously. \u201cNo, Jonathan, me and Steve are not back together. Not that it's any of your business.\u201d She stilled as soon as the words had left her mouth. \u201cSorry,\u201d she said, \u201cI didn't mean \u2013\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n<span>\u201cIts fine,\u201d said Jonathan, \u201cAlthough,\u00a0I mean, we never officially broke up, so \u2013\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n<span>\u201cIs that what you want? For us to officially break up?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n<span>Was that what he wanted? Jonathan wasn't sure, actually. He loved Nancy, he really did, but he wasn't sure if it was still the same kind of love as before he'd moved California.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n<span>\u201cIs that what you want?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n<span>Nancy looked at him for a long moment. \u201cI don't know,\u201d she answered honestly, \u201cBut I can promise you that Steve and I are over.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n<span>Jonathan nodded, waiting for the relief to set in, but it never came. Truth was, he probably wouldn't mind if they did start dating again, which, all on and by itself, should have been answer enough to Nancy\u2019s question.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n<span>But he didn't want to think about that just now, so he didn't, instead shifting his focus back to getting to know Steve.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n<span>If Harrington found it weird that he suddenly found himself spending time with Jonathan, he didn't say so. He was nice about it, actually. When Jonathan showed up at Family Video under the thinly veiled disguise of finding a movie for their upcoming movie night and ended up simply making stilted small talk with both Steve and Robin, when Jonathan made a point of sitting with Steve and Eddie during said movie night, when Jonathan invited himself to smoking sessions at Eddie\u2019s trailer whenever Steve was there, Steve was nice about it. Nice about him being there. Pleasant and polite and sometimes even teasing the way he was with the kids and Robin and Nancy and Eddie, almost as if they, too, were friends now. As if there was nothing weird about Jonathan Byers and Steve Harrington hanging out outside of world-ending scenarios. </span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n<span>Except it <em>was</em> weird. Wasn't it?</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n<span>\u201cThis is so weird, man,\u201d Jonathan said one day, almost at the end of the summer break, all the older members of their little adventure group hanging out at Robin\u2019s house while kids had a sleepover at Lucas\u2019.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n<span>\u201cWhat is?\u201d Steve asked, passing the joint back to Jonathan.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n<span>They were both sky high at this point and it was getting pretty late. Nancy and Robin had disappeared off to somewhere else, probably to get some sleep, and Eddie was fiddling with the stereo.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n<span>\u201cThis, man. Us sitting here like this. You and me.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n<span>Steve frowned up at him. \u201cWhat are you talking about, dude?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n<span>Jonathan shrugged and shook his head, the motion sluggish and lazy. He wasn't sure what he was talking about. \u201cNever thought I'd hang out with Steve Harrington of all people.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n<span>\u201cWe've been hanging out for years now, Byers.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n<span>\u201cYeah, when the world was ending. Not like this.\u201d He took another hit from the joint, blowing the smoke out into the living room, when Eddie re-joined them and Iron Maiden started playing in the background.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n<span>\u201cDon't worry, man,\u201d he said, patting Jonathan on the back and taking the blunt from him, \u201cI was where you are now, but \u2013\u201d He took a drag \u201c\u2014Stevie here really isn't all that bad.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n<span>\u201cHigh praises,\u201d Steve grumbled, and Eddie flashed him a grin.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n<span>\u201cAww, you know I love you, darling.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n<span>Jonathan watched Steve, waiting for a reaction but the only thing he got was pair of rolled eyes and a barely concealed smile.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n<span>\u201cYou going soft on me, Munson?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n<span>Eddie was still grinning, a little dopey, his eyes crinkling as he leaned in closer and placed a finger on Steve's lips. \u201cShhh, I have a reputation to uphold,\u201d he whispered.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n<span>And Jonathan kept watching as both men dissolved into helpless giggles, their foreheads pressed together and Eddie's finger still on Steve's lips, and he didn't get it because even stranger than Jonathan Buyers and Steve Harrington hanging out was Eddie Munson and Steve Harrington hanging out. And unlike Jonathan and Steve, Eddie and Steve seemed to be genuine, real friends.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n<span>Since his smoking buddies seemed a little distracted with laughing at the sound of their own laughter, Jonathan decided to do them all a favour and finish the joint, settling down on the armchair. It was comfy. Warm. Like sitting on a soft cloud, lulling him in, and Jonathan had just enough awareness to drop the joint into one of the half-full glasses on the table before he gave in to the sweet oblivion of sleep.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n<span>When he woke up the next morning, it was to a splitting headache and a rancid taste in his mouth.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n<span>He let out a long-suffering moan, peeling his eyes open and immediately regretting it when the sunlight falling through the windows hit him with all the force of a sledgehammer.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n<span>\u201cFuck.\u201d The sound of his own voice was too much, the word coming out gargled and rough, and he quickly closed his eyes again, slipping down to the floor and crawling on his hands and knees to where he remembered the kitchen to be. Blindly, he felt his way forward to the sink and experimentally cracked one eye open, finding the kitchen much darker and more bearable. Once he\u2019d downed several glasses of water and washed his face a little, he raided the bathroom in search of painkillers, getting enough for himself and the others for when they woke up, and decided to sit in the dark, cool kitchen until his head didn't feel like it was about to explode anymore. The house was quiet, everyone apparently still sleeping, which Jonathan counted as a blessing.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n<span>And then the girls came down the stairs, looking a little worse for wear.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n<span>\u201cMorning.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n<span>\u201cShh,\u201d Robin shushed him, \u201cToo loud.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n<span>\u201cSorry,\u201d Jonathan whispered, \u201cI got painkillers.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n<span>\u201cThanks.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n<span>Nancy, as the more coherent of the two, looked around. \u201cSteve and Eddie?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n<span>\u201cI don't know,\u201d Jonathan answered, \u201cI think they may have slept on the couch. I'll check if they're still alive.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n<span>Nancy nodded in acknowledgement but her attention was solely on Robin, holding her hair back as Robin drank straight from the tap, one hand rubbing soothing circles on her back.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n<span>Jonathan went back into the living room and \u2013</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n<span>Froze.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n<span>Sure enough, there were Steve and Eddie sleeping on the couch, both very much shirtless and snoring, with Steve essentially functioning as a human blanket to the older guy and Eddie's arms firmly wrapped around Steve. And as much as Jonathan understood passing out after a night of drinking and smoking, he found it hard to believe that they'd end up like that by accident.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n<span>\u201cJonathan?\u201d Nancy's voice sounded from the hallway, \u201cIs everything okay?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n<span>\u201cYeah. Yeah.\u201d Jonathan walked backwards, still staring at the couch. \u201cThey're asleep.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n<span>He nearly bumped into Nancy who was standing in the doorway now, a cup of coffee cradled in her hands, Robin next to her, both watching the two sleeping bodies on the floor.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n<span>\u201cAww, that is so disgustingly cute,\u201d Robin rasped out.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n<span>\u201cYou knew?\u201d asked Jonathan, looking back and forth between the girls who both nodded.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n<span>\u201cI take full credit for this,\u201d Robin said, gingerly walking over to the couch and nudging Steve, \u201cWake up, dingus. You\u2019re hogging the couch.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n<span>\u201c'ss'off,\u201d Steve slurred into Eddie's chest.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n<span>\u201cRude.\u201d But Robin did apparently declare the couch a losing battle and abandoned it in favour of slumping into the armchair. Nancy joined her, sitting down on the armrest and offering Robin some of her coffee.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n<span>Jonathan stayed back, watching the two girls in the armchair and the two boys on the couch and having the inkling suspicion that he\u2019d been running around with a blindfold on these last few weeks but now someone had taken it off and he could see \u2013 the smile on Steve's face, the fond and gentle and soft look in his eyes, the familiar and comfortable closeness \u2013 and maybe it made sense after all.</span>\n</p>\n<p>Will wasn't blind and Will wasn't stupid and he knew there was something going between Steve and Eddie. But he didn't say anything because it was also none of his business.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He did watch them, though.</p>\n<p>He'd been doing that a lot lately. Watching. Watching people and things and waiting for the other shoe to drop.\u00a0</p>\n<p>It was strange, being back in Hawkins. After everything that had happened, Will had almost expected the town to be different, more significant, somehow, but it was just a town. Shitty and small and a little grimy, but just a town. Before \u2013 before California and Vecna and El saving the day for good \u2013 Will had become accustomed to feeling like he didn't belong here. The things that had happened to him, the things he'd seen, on top of other things, more normal things, marked him as a freak and an outsider, more so than the others. And it wasn't that he'd been fine with that, exactly, but he'd gotten used to it, expected it even. When Mike and Lucas and Dustin had forgotten all about their friendship because of girls, it had hurt, sure, but he hadn't been surprised, because that was what was supposed to happen, wasn't it? Except it didn't happen for him because he was just <em>not like that</em>, because he was different, because he was on his own in this.</p>\n<p>Except he wasn't.</p>\n<p>Not anymore.</p>\n<p>He was back in Hawkins and suddenly there were people like him, people who were different, people who were also <em>not like that</em>.</p>\n<p>Like Robin, like Eddie, and like Steve, apparently.</p>\n<p>And it helped, knowing that there were others. Will was grateful for them, Robin and Eddie especially, for coming out to the whole group that one night in Mike's basement, because if they could, then so could he. One day. Maybe.</p>\n<p>In the meantime, there was something going on between Steve and Eddie and Will was watching them.</p>\n<p>\u201cCome <em>on</em>, Steve.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI said no!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re a lameass bitch, you know that?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHey!\u201d Eddie cut in, \u201cDon't you talk to your mother like that.\u201d</p>\n<p>They were in Family Video, Steve and Robin standing behind the counter, Eddie sitting criss-cross applesauce style <em>on</em> the counter like an overgrown shop cat, and Dustin was petulantly crossing his arms over his chest.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy do I have to be the mum?\u201d Steve asked, a deep crease of confusion between his eyebrows as he looked up at Eddie, \u201cWhy can't I be the dad?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBecause dad's suck,\u201d Eddie answered matter-of-factly, and both Dustin and Max nodded in agreement while Will tried to bite back a smile at the whole situation. Next to him, Lucas wasn't even trying. Mike was scowling.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh yeah? What's that make you then, the other mum?\u201d Steve asked in exasperation.</p>\n<p>Eddie gave a long, considering hum, leaning back on his hands, his shirt riding up his stomach and Will caught Steve staring at the exposed skin.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019d like to think of myself as the cool gay uncle.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIs that a thing?\u201d asked Steve, his eyes jumping back and forth between Eddie's face and Eddie's stomach, \u201cDo people have cool gay uncles?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI do,\u201d Max supplied, \u201cLives up in Canada. My mum fucking hates him.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLanguage,\u201d Steve warned her, pointing a finger, and Max simply stuck her tongue out at him. \u201cFine,\u201d Steve exclaimed, throwing his hands up in the air, \u201cI'm the mum. And as your <em>mum</em>, I'm saying I won't buy you alcohol because you're way too young for that shit.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe're 15,\u201d Dustin argued, \u201cAlmost 16.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cToo. Young.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhen\u2019d <em>you</em> start drinking?\u201d Max questioned, stepping forward.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat's so not the point.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou're right,\u201d Max agreed, \u201cThe point is that you're boring.\u201d</p>\n<p>Steve opened his mouth to protest but Eddie was quicker, putting a ring-clad hand on his arm.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAs the cool gay uncle,\u201d he announced, \u201cI will buy you the booze \u2013\u201d Steve's eyes snapped up in alarm and betrayal, while Dustin and Max high fived. \u201c\u2014under one condition,\u201d Eddie continued, waiting until they'd all quieted down before saying, \u201cBeer only, and we'll be there to keep an eye on things.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat's two conditions,\u201d Lucas pointed out but quickly backed down when Eddie turned a sharp look at him.</p>\n<p>\u201cDeal or no deal?\u201d asked Eddie, offering his hand to Dustin who whooped and accepted it with a grin on his face.</p>\n<p>\u201cDeal.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat are you doing, man?\u201d Steve hissed at Eddie when the others had moved further into the store to look for a movie to watch during Max\u2019 birthday party that night, both apparently forgetting that Will was still standing in earshot.</p>\n<p>Eddie leaned down close, his hair falling into Steve's face, but Steve didn't seem to mind. \u201cThey're gonna get shitfaced either way,\u201d he answered, \u201cIf we don't buy it for them, they'll find someone who will, and with our luck one of them is gonna get alcohol poisoning or fall and break their neck or some shit, so.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo, you'd rather be there to keep an eye on things,\u201d Steve finished Eddie's train of thought, nodding slowly.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou get me, darling.\u201d Eddie was smirking down at Steve, staying close, and Steve wasn't moving away, and Will thought, maybe, he should stop staring. But he didn't.\u00a0</p>\n<p>It was Robin who broke the tension eventually, pointedly clearing her throat, and Steve blinked owlishly.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou got something to say, Buckley?\u201d Eddie asked, turning his gaze into her.</p>\n<p>\u201cNancy's gonna kill you both when she finds out, you do realise that, right?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd, pray tell, how would Nancy possibly find out, unless you told her?\u201d</p>\n<p>Robin remained quiet, her cheeks tinged a little red before she muttered something about regret and walked away, leaving Steve and Eddie alone at the counter and, this time, Will really did stop staring.</p>\n<p>In a way, being in California had helped him, actually. He felt like he had a bit of a new perspective now, like he was more his own person. Less confused. Still hopelessly pining after Mike, but less confused, and in the grand scheme of things Will counted that as a win, and he welcomed the normality of it. He'd rather be freaking out about his crush than another world-ending crisis. Even if that crisis had come eventually. But it was over now. For good this time.</p>\n<p>And he was still pining over Mike. But that was okay.</p>\n<p>They'd figure it out.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Probably.</p>\n<p>He'd learned a thing or two in California, was the thing, where people were a lot more open about a lot of things. For example, Will knew that the handkerchief dangling from Eddie's back pocket had a very specific meaning, and so when said handkerchief disappeared, Will didn't have to be a genius to figure out what had happened, just as he didn't have to be genius to know that it had something to with Steve.</p>\n<p>He'd seen them, after Vecna had been defeated and they'd all been reunited, had seen the way they'd looked at each other, had seen the way they'd slowly grown closer, had seen the way Eddie's smile had gradually become less and less mocking and more and more fond, had seen the way Steve had stopped rolling his eyes quite so hard and started sitting closer to Eddie than Robin during movie night.</p>\n<p>And he was seeing them now sitting side by side on the edge of Steve's pool, feet in the water.</p>\n<p>Everyone else was asleep, passed out after drinking two beers, and all safely tucked into the makeshift beds in Steve's living room, with only Will left awake. He hadn't wanted to drink and kind of regretted it now; maybe he'd be able to fall asleep as well if he had. But he hadn't so he wasn't, meaning there was not much else to do than look at Steve's and Eddie's backs and the way they were clearly holding hands as they shared a cigarette and a beer of their own, their voices muffled through the closed door but occasionally Will could hear one of them laughing, head thrown back and filled with happiness, and Will smiled to himself.</p>\n<p>One day, maybe, that could be him. And maybe it would be Mike by his side, or maybe someone else, someone who was different, someone who was not like that, someone who would take his hand and share his drink with him in the dead of night the way Steve and Eddie did.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Hawkins had, over the past two or three years, gotten very used to people dying. What it was not used to was dead people coming back to life. Metaphorically speaking, or whatever, since Jim hadn't been dead. Just kidnapped and tortured by Russians. He got over it.</p>\n<p>Being back Hawkins, though, it was weird, was what it was. He hadn't missed it, exactly, except maybe he also had, because the second he saw dilapidated town, smelled the manure from the fields, felt the chill from the breeze, he could have cried with joy and relief. Probably would have, too, if he'd been anyone else.</p>\n<p>And things were slightly better now what with Joyce back in the picture and the two of them living together with Will and Jonathan, even if the latter was bound to move out and away for college by the end of the summer. Still. It was nice, being surrounded by people for once. Having a family again.</p>\n<p>And it didn't seem to stop with Joyce and her two boys. While Jim had been busy breaking out of a Gulag, making it back to the States in one piece, and explaining how it was he was still alive, all the kids had apparently become even closer to each other and even found one or two new editions, like Jonathan's strange friend Argyle, or Eddie fucking Munson.</p>\n<p>Jim knew Munson, was the thing, knew what he got up in the woods and in his van and at parties. He'd given him more than one warning over the years and would have liked nothing more than to send the useless, little piece of shit to rot in jail, if only so Jim wouldn't have to hear him and his stupid band again.</p>\n<p>But that had been then.</p>\n<p>These days, Jim wouldn't have cared if Eddie sold crack to middle-schoolers, because nearly dying for the fourth time in a row really did seem to put some things into perspective. Besides, Eddie actually seemed like an alright guy, all things considered, even if Jim would have rather gone back to Russia than admit that out loud. Not that he had to, mind, since no one ever asked his opinion on the matter. Munson was just <em>there</em> \u2013 driving the kids around in his beat up van, walking down the street with his arm around Robin Buckley\u2019s shoulders, showing up to lunches and dinners and movie nights with the rest of the group as if he belonged there, that smug, impish grin always on his face and a glint in his eyes. At least he seemed to be doing his best to steer clear of Jim.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He and Joyce had decided to go the fun fair they'd set up again in occasion of the end of summer break, this time without worrying about Russian Arnold Schwarzenegger, and as much as Jim hated to admit it, he was having a good time, actually. They hadn't gone on any rides yet, but he hadn't missed the way Joyce was eyeing the Ferris Wheel, and Jim was mentally preparing himself for that, when he spotted Steve and Munson from the corner of his eye at one of the booths. Munson was trying his hand at throwing darts at balloons and apparently doing quite well if the small crowd of children watching them in awe was anything to go by\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHow are you so good at this?\u201d he heard Steve ask, just as Munson was about to throw another dart.</p>\n<p>\u201cI've been winning rigged games since before I could walk, princess,\u201d Munson replied with confidence and took aim. The dart hit the balloon with a little pop, and the children cheered as the owner of the booth handed over a big, plush teddy bear to Munson who immediately offered it up to Steve.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat am I supposed to do with this?\u201d asked Steve, even though he'd already accepted it, hugging the teddy with both his arms.</p>\n<p>Munson patted the teddy on its fuzzy head. \u201cCherish it with all your heart, Harrington.\u201d</p>\n<p>And, again, Jim wouldn't say this out loud under horrendous torture, but it was nice seeing them like this, happy and safe, after everything they'd gone through. After everything they'd all gone through.</p>\n<p>And then things took a turn for the worse.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou've got some nerve coming here,\u201d a loud voice proclaimed, \u201cMurderer.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jason Carver stood tall, looming over the children who quickly scattered, a group of Jason's friends flanking his shoulders, Tommy H among them.</p>\n<p>Jim watched as Munson let out a heavy sigh before turning around, his teeth bared. \u201cLong time no see,\u201d he said, \u201cCan't say I missed it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou're not welcome here, freak.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd you,\u201d Munson replied, taking a step forward and poking a finger into Jason's chest, \u201cAre not the boss of me, pretty boy.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jason slapped his hand away, his face distorted in sheer hatred and disgust. \u201cDon't touch me, fag.\u201d</p>\n<p>Munson raised his hands in mock surrender. \u201cMethinks the jock doth protest too much,\u201d he said, still grinning sharply as if he found the entire situation terribly amusing. Jim couldn't say he agreed. \u201cYou're a little obsessed with me, aren't you, Carver? I'm flattered, really, but, alas, it would just never work out between us.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jason looked like he was about to throw either throw up or throw a punch, and Jim got ready to step in, just in case. Steve, apparently, must have had the same idea, because he was stepping forward now, one hand laid on Munson's shoulder.</p>\n<p>\u201cCome on, Eddie, let's go.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cReally, Harrington? You hang out with the freak now?\u201d Tommy H sneered. Steve didn't react beyond rolling his eyes and gently steering Munson away, and Jim was just about to relax, when Tommy called after them.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou better be careful, or people might get the wrong idea.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI think they'd get the right idea,\u201d Jason said, \u201cI think he likes taking it up the ass from the pervert.\u201d</p>\n<p>Steve snapped back around, walking up close to Jason. \u201cWhat did you call him?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSteve, don\u2019t \u2013\u201d</p>\n<p>Jason smirked maliciously. \u201cYou heard. Pervert.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jim wasn't a 100% sure on who threw the first punch, but his money was on Steve, and he was almost ashamed to say that it took him a moment to react, too stunned by the two boys screaming and hitting at each in blind rage.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat's enough,\u201d he yelled, grabbing Jason by the shoulders and flinging him off Steve, against the side of the dart booth with a little too much force, maybe. \u201cWalk away,\u201d he warned the boy, standing protectively in front of Steve.</p>\n<p>Jason scoffed, rubbing the blood off his face. \u201cThis isn't over yet,\u201d he declared, finger pointed threateningly at Steve and Munson, but he did walk away.</p>\n<p>\u201cAlright everyone, show\u2019s over,\u201d Jim called out to the bystanders, glancing at Steve to make sure he didn't need an ambulance. The boy did look a little worse for wear, blood dripping from his nose and his lip, one eye already swollen, and his knuckles were clearly scrapped and bruised. Munson was supporting him, glaring at Jason's retreating back.</p>\n<p>\u201cCome on, let's get you cleaned up.\u201d Jim took both boys to his car before going on a search for some water and a clean cloth.</p>\n<p>Joyce was eerily silent next to him, her fists clenched.</p>\n<p>\u201cI'll get them something to eat and drink,\u201d she announced curtly, not waiting for a response before stomping off and Jim watched her go.</p>\n<p>When he returned to his car with a bowl of ice cold water and a cloth, Steve and Munson were sitting on the hood, their backs turned to him, a cigarette passing back and forth between their hands, and despite the noise coming from the fair, Jim could hear Munson's voice, clear as day.</p>\n<p>\u201cI don't need you to defend my honour, Steve.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou heard what he called you, right?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes. Yes, I heard. I'm not deaf. But getting into fights over it, isn't helping anyone. Least of all you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWasn't really thinking about me,\u201d Steve muttered, running a hand through his hair and wincing a little.</p>\n<p>Jim stood behind them, a little undecided and not wanting to intrude.</p>\n<p>\u201cI just \u2013\u201d Steve continued, \u201c\u2014I fucking hate it, okay? The way they treat you. It's not fair.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat, and you think I'm enjoying this?\u201d Eddie asked rhetorically, \u201cYou think I like walking through town and people crossing the street the second they see me? I mean, don't get wrong, I've never been Mr. Popular, but this is different, because when they called me a freak and a fag, at least I knew where I was at and I could laugh it off because they had no idea how right they were, but this?\u201d He shook his head, blowing out the smoke before handing the cig back to Steve. \u201cI didn't kill Chrissy.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jim didn't miss the way Steve shifted closer until their shoulders touched, reaching out to take Munson's hand, nor the way Munson leaned into the touch, and he suddenly felt like he was in the wrong place at the very wrong time.</p>\n<p>\u201cThey kinda have point though, y\u2019know,\u201d Munson muttered, \u201cPeople are starting to talk. Wondering what golden boy Steve Harrington is doing with a schmuck like me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah well, fuck em.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat's the spirit.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jim made another attempt at coming closer, the bowl of water in his arms growing heavy, but apparently, Munson had other ideas.</p>\n<p>\u201cHow are you doing?\u201d</p>\n<p>Steve shrugged, taking a drag of the cigarette and reaching up to his face. \u201cIt's just a few cuts and bruises. I've had worse.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat's not what I meant,\u201d Munson responded, leaning forward a little to look right at Steve, and Jim took a step back again.</p>\n<p>\u201cI used to be like them,\u201d Steve muttered, handing the cigarette to Munson and lowering his head, \u201cI used to say those words and I mean them like they did.\u201d</p>\n<p>Munson took a drag, smoke spilling from between his lips. \u201cI know,\u201d he said casually, as if they'd been through that particular conversation before.</p>\n<p>\u201cI guess \u2013\u201d Steve huffed out a breath. \u201c\u2014I guess I just didn't realize how much it hurts, y\u2019know?\u201d</p>\n<p>Munson hummed, finishing the cigarette and leaning back a little, his weight supported by one hand behind his back. \u201cI could be a complete dick now and say something fucked up about karma and poetic justice, but I won't, because I like you and apparently I'm nice now.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cEddie Munson being nice?\u201d Steve teased him, laughter in his voice, \u201cSomeone call the papers.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHmm, headline practically rights itself.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jim decided he'd enough, then. Whatever moment the two boys had had, it was clearly over, and he really wasn't interested in lurking behind them for another hour, so instead he loudly cleared his throat and approached.</p>\n<p>He caught Munson quickly letting go of Steve's hand and the flash of disappointment on Steve's face, but decided to ignore it.</p>\n<p>\u201cFor your face,\u201d him said, offering up the bowl and the cloth.</p>\n<p>\u201cThanks,\u201d said Steve, taking both, beginning to clean up his wounds, but Munson slapped his hands away and instead dipped the cloth into the water himself and delicately wiped the blood off Steve, while Jim watched, feeling just a little awkward.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSo,\u201d he prompted, hoping to alleviate some of the tension, \u201cYou into street fights now?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe deserved it,\u201d Steve muttered, glancing at Jim from the corner of his eye, barely wincing as Munson dabbed the wet cloth against his split lip.</p>\n<p>\u201cNot gonna argue with you there, but, well, you should probably not make a habit of it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWasn't planning on it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGood.\u201d Jim nodded, folding his arms across his chest. \u201cYou should go see a doctor if you're starting to feel dizzy or nauseous.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDon't worry, I will,\u201d Steve promised, turning his head to look at him, much to Munson's annoyance, \u201cYou don't have to, like, babysit us, you know. I've had worse.\u201d</p>\n<p><em>I know</em>, Jim thought darkly, remembering Steve's face after Starcourt and the scar on his stomach.</p>\n<p>\u201cAlright,\u201d he said instead, starting to back away just as Munson set aside the bowl of now bloodied water, wiping his hands on his jeans, his eyes fixed on Steve's face, and there was something about the look he was giving Steve that made Jim falter and stop. \u201cHey, uh \u2013\u201d He hesitated, debating with himself if he should really get involved in this. \u201c\u2014Hey, you boys gonna be okay?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe'll be fine,\u201d Steve answered dismissively, \u201cLike I said, I've had worse.\u201d</p>\n<p>It was a good out, and Jim almost took it, except Munson was looking at <em>him</em> now, a calculating expression on his face.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat's not what I meant,\u201d Jim echoed Munson's earlier words, and Steve stilled, his shoulders growing tense.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe'll be fine,\u201d said Munson the same calculating expression still on his face as if he was trying to see right through Jim's skull and into his brain. It reminded him a little bit of how El used to look at him, back in the beginning, all wide-eyed and suspicious.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, if \u2013 If anyone else gives you any more shit about \u2013 about anything, you call me, alright? Being chief of police must be good for something.\u201d</p>\n<p>Munson still didn't look convinced, but Steve at least gave him a weak smile, his shoulders relaxing a little. \u201cThanks. Thanks, Jim.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDon't mention it, son.\u201d Jim rubbed the back of his neck. \u201cJust. Be careful out there. It's a shitty world.\u201d</p>\n<p>Steve opened his mouth as if to answer, but Joyce chose that moment to return with two comes of dripping ice cream.</p>\n<p>\u201cSorry it took so long, there was a \u2013 a really long line.\u201d</p>\n<p>Steve's eyes grew wide as Joyce handed him one of the cones. \u201cI \u2013 thanks, but \u2013\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAlso, you're coming to dinner tonight.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, no, you don't have to \u2013\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI insist. God knows your parents are never home and I doubt you cook for yourself.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe doesn't,\u201d Munson chimed in, accepting his own ice cream with almost childish glee, \u201cAnd we'd love to come by for dinner.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDude.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Munson shrugged at Steve \u201cIt's free food, man.\u201d</p>\n<p>Steve rolled his eyes, but he did thank Joyce again. \u201cYou really don't have to cook for me though.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI want to. You're family.\u201d</p>\n<p>That night, Jim found himself at a table that was too small for the amount of people sitting at it, but he wasn't complaining.</p>\n<p>And when Max and Lucas started throwing peas at each other and half of them landed on the floor that he knew he would have to clean up afterwards, he didn't complain, and when Mike and Dustin started arguing about some comic, he didn't complain, and when Steve grabbed Munson's hand right there next to his plate for everyone to see, he smiled because Joyce was right. They were all family and he was alive and the people of Hawkins clearly didn't know what they were missing.</p>"
