  "text": "<p>\n<span>Midoriya Izuku finds out at a very early that the world is unfair. </span>\n<em>\n<span>Quirkless\u2013</span>\n</em>\n<span>the first label he\u2019s given on the playground. It stings\u2013hurts, really\u2013when he sees Katsuki standing opposite him instead of beside. It hurts more when Kacchan flings insults at him, but Deku stands up to him. He may not be strong, and he doesn\u2019t have a quirk to fight back with, but he doesn't back down. The disparity between Deku\u2019s strength of will and his fighting strength irk Katsuki to no end.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>They stop being friends, but they grow up in close proximity. They grow up center of attention and stepped on. Deku grows up hounded at every turn by the only person he thought of as a friend. Katsuki hurls insults and puts a wall between them. Deku never questions it. He never questions why Katsuki is so sure of himself or why he looks down on people who are quirkless. He knows why. He knows he\u2019s weak. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Deku learns to hunch his shoulders and make himself as small as possible. He stands up to Kacchan by refusing to run. Maybe it\u2019s not the smartest thing to do, but he refuses to back down. He stops crying when Kacchan hits him. His breath stops hitching at every insult. He learns to listen and not take things to heart right away. (He does that later, when he\u2019s alone in his room with the door shut and his mother sleeping soundly.) </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>When Deku gets a cold halfway through third grade. He doesn\u2019t notice that Kacchan doesn\u2019t touch him for those ten days. He doesn\u2019t notice that all Kacchan does is yell \u201cnerd\u2019 at him as they pass in the hallway. He doesn\u2019t notice the pair of red eyes that trail after him as he blows his nose into an overused tissue. The regular insults and getting shoved aside comes back when the cold goes away.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>When they turn thirteen, Deku gets another label. </span>\n<em>\n<span>Markless.</span>\n</em>\n<span> The thirteenth birthday is around when everyone starts getting soulmarks. They appear small, just a single dot or a simple design. Girls appear in class with brightly-colored ribbons tied around theirs. Some of the boys use bandages to look cool. Other people use stickers to cover them. Very few people let the marks go in the open. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Deku doesn\u2019t bother lying about it when people ask. </span>\n<em>\n<span>No, he doesn\u2019t have one.</span>\n</em>\n<span> He checks himself in the mirror every morning. All that marks his skin are freckles.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Katsuki covers his with a bright red bandage, proudly holds it up so people see he has it, but doesn\u2019t answer a single question about who it is. Deku tries to keep his eyes on his notebook and not on the red fabric around Katsuki\u2019s right hand. He gets used to it in time, but his eyes still catch on crimson when he lets his thoughts wander. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<span>Markless.</span>\n</em>\n<span> Deku considers putting a bandage over some random place. His arm maybe or telling people it\u2019s on his hip where they won\u2019t bother to look. He doesn\u2019t. He knows bullies. They might just use it as an excuse to humiliate him further, so he keeps his head down. </span>\n<em>\n<span>Markless. </span>\n</em>\n<span>The questions of \u201cdid you get it yet\u201d die out, but the label stays.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>They grow up Kacchan and Deku\u2013two boys who dream of nothing but being heroes. They\u2019re two boys who look at the same view of the world with different lenses. They\u2019re the two boys, first from their school, who get into Yuuei.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>The last year of junior high, Deku pretends he doesn\u2019t notice that stops talking to him. There are no passing shouts of \u201cfucking nerd\u201d or \u201cquirkless\u201d as they pass each other. He doesn\u2019t know if it bothers him. He puts all his energy into becoming a hero. He walks down the hallway completely invisible. Katsuki and the boys who follow him around are the only ones who ever talked to him.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>He doesn\u2019t know if Katsuki\u2019s silence is a good thing or if it\u2019s unsettling. Except he does. Deku is good at going through and figuring things out. He\u2019s figured out how to look at his feelings and how to reason them out and then stuff them away if he needs to.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>The next time he sees Katsuki, it\u2019s at the entrance exam. They\u2019re seated by school in the large auditorium, and the few centimeters between them has never felt so far. Maybe something will change. (It already has.)</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Katsuki makes his friends and Deku makes others. And, yes, he actually makes friends. He\u2019s grown up keeping his mouth shut, but now he doesn\u2019t have to. He has a powerful quirk through the miracle known as All Might and people are looking at him with something other than contempt in their eyes.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>In Yuuei class 1-A he\u2019s Deku, no longer quirkless but vying for top-of-the-class. They haven\u2019t talked about soulmarks yet. He doesn\u2019t ask his classmates about it, and they don\u2019t ask him. Katsuki has long ago taken to wearing gloves that cover the spot the strip of red cloth once did.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Villains start making their move, and Deku fills his mind with ways to get stronger. He trains hard and harder. Deku takes up his name and wears it proudly. Katsuki meant it as an insult, but that doesn\u2019t matter now. Deku. It\u2019s short and simple, and it\u2019s a name he wore through childhood and through whatever life threw at him. He\u2019ll carry that name through his teenage life, and through the foreseeable future. It\u2019s his name now.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Deku finds Todoroki Shouto. He adds him to his growing list of friends by blowing through his insecurities. Deku ends up losing their fight, but he wins something better. Their bond is strong battle-forged and battle-tested. By the beginning of their second year, they\u2019re Shoucchan and \u2018Zuku. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>The villains grow stronger, but so do the heroes. Izuku trains hard every day to control his quirk. It\u2019s difficult, but he\u2019s improving. Deku studies hard and trains harder. He manages to make friends and keep them even in the busy and competitive classroom. They may end up vying for the same spots as the world\u2019s heroes one day, but he still wants to be friends with them. Maybe that\u2019s only because he grew up alone.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Ochako becomes one of his best friends in class and out. She\u2019s the first person to bring up soulmarks in their class. She mentions it suddenly when they have a free moment.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIwanttoshowyoumysoulmarktoseeifyouknowwhoitis,\u201d she says.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Deku blinks at her and asks her to repeat it. He does his fair share of talking quickly, but it\u2019s still not easy to understand. He puts down the pencil he\u2019d been using to scribble notes on heroes and looks up at her. The pink on her cheeks is more pronounced than usual, and she doesn\u2019t make eye contact the way she usually does. Ochako takes a deep breath and forces herself to look Deku in the eye.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI want to show you my soulmark, to see if you have any ideas of who it is.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>The color in Deku\u2019s face rises quickly, and he stammers that he has no experience and is probably not the person anyone should ask because he doesn\u2019t have one and\u2013</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou don\u2019t?\u201d She asks, surprised.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Deku\u2019s face falls. He didn\u2019t want to talk about it, didn\u2019t mean to bring it up. Now he\u2019ll gain that label again. </span>\n<em>\n<span>Markless.</span>\n</em>\n<span> When he looks up, he\u2019s surprised to see the smile on her face.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou can still fall in love, you know? Or maybe it\u2019s just late, like your quirk.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>He nods. He can\u2019t tell her his quirk isn\u2019t something he was born with. She\u2019s trying to comfort him, and he\u2019s grateful for that.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cCan I still show you mine?\u201d She asks.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>He nods again. </span>\n<em>\n<span>Sure</span>\n</em>\n<span>.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Ochako rolls up the sleeve of her Yuuei uniform past her elbow, and turns her arm toward Deku. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHere.\u201d She points.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>There\u2019s a green mark on her arm. It doesn\u2019t quite have a shape, and Deku has no guesses as to what it might be. It looks like a photograph that\u2019s out of focus. Marks change. They grow in response to the person they\u2019re on and the person their for. They\u2019ll change when the two people meet, and they\u2019ll change when the two people interact, and they\u2019ll change even more when the two realize. It will focus someday and then she\u2019ll know.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I don\u2019t know,\u201d he mutters.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Ochako bites her lip and walks away, rolling her sleeve back down to recover the mark. Katsuki snaps a pencil in half behind him. Deku turns around, and just catches the glare he\u2019s given. A shiver runs down his spine. He didn\u2019t </span>\n<em>\n<span>do</span>\n</em>\n<span> anything.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Katsuki corners him the next day. It\u2019s a situation he hasn\u2019t experienced for a while, but Deku instinctively presses himself against the wall and shrinks down. It\u2019s habit by now. He hesitatingly looks up to see an angry glare, though for Katsuki, that\u2019s normal.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAre you really markless?\u201d Kacchan growls.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYes,\u201d he nods. He doesn\u2019t have a reason to lie.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Katsuki chews on his lip and turns away. \u201cFucking useless,\u201d he spits.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Deku thinks he hears a little something other than anger. Maybe he\u2019s just imagining it. Katsuki probably has some reasons.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Second year continues between normal classes and the occasional skirmishes villains. After their big face-off against All For One in their first year, the villains seemed to be recuperating. They\u2019re coming back in force.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>The school struggles to keep their doors open. Eventually, they decide to give the hero class students to use their quirks if they\u2019re threatened. It\u2019s not a good solution, but it makes them more confident. They don\u2019t have to run away if confronted. They\u2019re supposed to contact a pro hero if possible, but they don\u2019t have to worry about getting in trouble if they need protect their lives.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Deku lands in the hospital for the upteenth time. It\u2019s not too bad. When he wakes up, he sees Shouto perched on the end of his bed. He\u2019d been somewhere else for the fight. The moment Deku stirs, Shouto\u2019s eyes open. There\u2019s the greeting of \u201cyou\u2019re awake.\u201d Shouto smiles softly. It\u2019s not something that happens often, but Deku treasures it every time it does. He can sympathize with Shouto. After all, they both grew up alone, though for very different reasons. So he appreciates those smiles that he knows can\u2019t come easily. He returns it as best he can, and Shouto promises to bring him notes from the day\u2019s classes.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Ochako comes to him a few days after he gets out of the hospital with a smile on her face. \u201cI figured out what my mark was.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>It takes a full minute for Deku to process what she\u2019s talking about. He\u2019s been so preoccupied by training and One for All that he\u2019s all but forgotten about soulmarks. When he does, he reads the smile on Ochako\u2019s face.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWho is it?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>She rolls up her sleeve again. It\u2019s no longer blurry but clear. A green frog sits on her arm. As he looks at it, the frog sticks out a pink tongue and blinks at him. It reminds him clearly of another member of their class. Deku looks up at his friend.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cA-asui?\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Ochako nods, her face brighter by the second.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHave you\u2013?\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\n<br>\n</span>\n<span>Ochako nods faster.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cSo are you\u2013?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cShe kissed me!\u201d Ochako exclaims. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Then buries her face in her hands. Her forehead, that\u2019s still visible, is very, very pink. Not that Deku isn\u2019t, too. They both burst into a fit of embarrassed laughter, that only stops when someone slams down their notebook on the desk behind them. Deku turns to see Katsuki sulking. Ochako goes to her seat quietly. Deku stares at Kacchan for another moment before turning back to his own notes. They were being noisy, true, but Kacchan\u2019s reaction seems out of place. Then again, it\u2019s Bakugou Katsuki. Deku shrugs to himself and turns around.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>He can\u2019t shake the feeling that there\u2019s a pair of eyes boring holes into him. He tucks his head into his elbow, and does his best to ignore the glare. Someone pokes him the shoulder a moment later. It\u2019s Shouto\u2013Shoucchan. Deku is still thinking about soulmates and soulmarks so he says something he wouldn\u2019t normally.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhat do you think\u2019s the latest anyone\u2019s developed a soulmark?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Shouto looks at him like he\u2019s grown three heads, but he also flushes slightly. Deku starts to backtrack, with \u201cit doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d Shouto settles in his seat, still turned towards Deku. They were allowed to pick seats when second year began. Katsuki sits directly behind Deku, and Shouto chose one next to him. Ochako sits on his other side.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI never really thought about it,\u201d Shouto answers, when he recovers from the initial shock.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI see.\u201d A sigh.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cDo you want to see mine?\u201d Shouto leans on the table, chin in his hands.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWha\u2013nonono, it\u2019s fine, you don\u2019t have to\u2013\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Shouto looks away. \u201cI don\u2019t mind,\u201d he says almost too quickly.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYesplease.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAfter class, then.\u201d Shouto turns away.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWait why?\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Shouto looks up at him. His face is a little pink, and somehow Deku feels his chest flutter at that. Wait what? Deku turns back to his desk, trying to settle his heartbeat and hope that his face isn\u2019t as red as it feels.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIt\u2019s here,\u201d Shouto answers, tapping his chest with his hand.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Deku lights up like a traffic signal. Yeah, later sounds good. A lot later. Later when his heart rate is under control. Halfway through class, he can\u2019t think about the lesson at all. Everyone laughs when the teacher has to call his name twice for him to notice. He only looks up because Shouto prods him from the side with his foot. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>After class, he follows Shouto out into the hallway. There are too many people there. Shouto\u2019s not exactly self conscious, but it\u2019s not really appropriate to unbutton his shirt in the hallway. They end up in a bathroom five minutes later. Deku presses himself into a corner of the stall and Shouto leans against the other. Come to think of it, the last time he was in bathroom stall was when Kacchan decided it would be fun to stick his head in a toilet. Fun times\u2013for the blond, at least. Deku tries to keep his gaze somewhere other than his friend.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cSorry, about this,\u201d Shouto mutters, nodding to the cramped walls.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>His hands fumble with his tie and the buttons of his jacket and hands them to Deku. Deku folds them over his arm keeping his gaze down. He tries not to think about what exactly they\u2019re doing or what anyone else would think if they walked in. Shouto clears his throat.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou can look now, \u2018Zuku,\u201d he murmurs.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Deku turns towards his friend and feels his face heat up again. It\u2019s some comfort that Shouto, too, is more than a little pink. Izuku\u2019s eyes trace down Shouto\u2019s chest and then stop. The mark is in the center of his chest, basically over his heart. It\u2019s a bright red spiky star that stands out against his skin. Lines swirl around the star. They glow with energy, sparking as Deku looks.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThat looks like my\u2013\u201d Deku starts, then slams a hand over his mouth. His eyes dart up quickly.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIt\u2019s your quirk,\u201d Shouto says. \u201cI guess I wanted you to know.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Shouto reaches for the hem of his shirt to close it again at the same time as Deku reaches his palm forward. They freeze. Shouto slowly lets go of his shirt again. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cGo ahead,\u201d he prompts.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Deku presses his palm flat against Shouto\u2019s chest. Shouto\u2019s skin is warm. The lines of energy seem to glow brighter and the points of the star-like shape sharpen. There\u2019s a steady pulse under Deku\u2019s palm. It\u2019s steady, but fast. Deku realizes what he\u2019s doing and pulls back like he\u2019s been given an electric shock.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cSorry, Shoucchan, I didn\u2019t mean\u2026um\u2026\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Deku looks to the side silently as Shouto re-buttons his shirt, and hands his friend back his tie and uniform jacket. Shouto finishes, but neither of them makes another move.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI\u2019m your soulmate,\u201d Deku mumbles.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYeah.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cBut I don\u2019t have a\u2026\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI don\u2019t care. I\u201d Shouto places a hand on his shoulder. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t care if you weren\u2019t my soulmate at all. I think I\u2013\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>And of course, then is when the door is blasted off it\u2019s hinges. Because Bakugou Katsuki has impeccable timing and great self-control.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhat the fuck?\u201d The blond slams his hands against the wall, against each of the stall walls. \u201cWhat the fucking shit is going on here?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNone of your business, Bakugou,\u201d Shouto says stepping in so he edges in front of Deku.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Katsuki mirrors him. Deku stutters both their names, but Katsuki doesn\u2019t look and Shouto doesn\u2019t waver.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYes, it fucking is,\u201d Katsuki spits.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>He lifts his hands exposing his palms\u2013the gloves he usually wears blown to pieces along with the door. There are twin marks on the palms of his hands. Each has a sort of blurry gold shape in the center, but each is surrounded green circles. When he looks more closely, he sees that there are words in the lines. After a moment of reading, he realizes that the words are random notes about heroes\u2013things he\u2019s probably muttered at some point or other.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Suddenly, Deku has two boys towering over him\u2013one furiously flaming and the other staring with an unreadable sort of expression.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIt\u2019s really fucking obvious this is yours. It even started out a disgusting little green lump.\u201d Kacchan clenches his fist. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Deku answers quickly, and it sounds more like a question than it should.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>He startles when Katsuki slams his fist against the side of the stall. \u201cIt\u2019s not your fault. I fucking hate how you try to take responsibility for every single fucking thing.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>They\u2019re dragged back to the the classroom by the teacher. Katsuki sticks his hands deep into his pockets so no one can see his palms. Deku briefly wonders why he used to only cover his right hand, but is way too terrified to ask. Katsuki goes through the rest of the day yelling a little louder than usual, and keeping his hands under the desk. He gets detention for destroying school property. Shouto hardly talks to Deku for the rest of the day, and voices a hardly-audible goodbye as he leaves.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Izuku watches Ochako and Asui walk to the school gates together. He\u2019s happy for them, he really is, but he doesn\u2019t want to think about the mess of his own soulmates. Maybe getting the quirk from All Might somehow screwed it up. Or maybe Shouto and Katsuki are somehow mistaken. Deku has never considered himself to be one for a relationship. It would make sense, really, if he didn\u2019t have one. Yes, that must be it.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Deku starts shrinking again when he sits in class. He still trains as hard as he can, but he talks a little less to his classmates. He wants to, but he\u2019s not sure what he would say to them. Ochako has less time for him, but she still greets him cheerily every morning. He spends more time with Iida when he can. Deku purposefully looks away from Shoucchan\u2019s seat next to him and ducks his head whenever Kacchan is around. He thinks it\u2019s fine, until Ochako pulls him aside.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIt\u2019s not good if the top three in class don\u2019t even look at each other. What happened?\u201d She looks concerned, and Deku can\u2019t quite face her. \u201cI thought you were friends with Todoroki-kun.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Deku worries his bottom lip. He was friends with Shouto. He was friends with Katsuki, too, long, long ago. He glances nervously at Ochako\u2019s concerned expression. The problem is he doesn\u2019t know what to do. No clue. From what he\u2019s heard about marks, they come in pairs. If he doesn\u2019t have one, and both Shouto and Katsuki have his, where does that leave them? He hates making Ochako worry, so he bites his lip.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI\u2019ll talk to them,\u201d he promises. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>The moment the words are out of his mouth, he regrets it. Now he really has to talk to them. Shoucchan is quieter, but still possibly very, very terrifying and Kacchan is\u2013well\u2013he\u2019s Kacchan. He doesn\u2019t have a chance to start a conversation with either one of them for the rest of the day. He intends to look for Shouto first. They\u2019re better friends, or were. Luckily or unluckily, they find him first.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cDeku, are you really fucking sure you don\u2019t have a mark?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>They\u2019re standing outside of Yuuei at the end of the day. Deku presses himself into the side of the school building\u2013still a habit.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI\u2019m curious, too,\u201d Shouto adds, much more gently than Katsuki. \u201cWhen was the last time you checked?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cShoucchan, um, well\u2026istoppedcheckingbecauseitwasn\u2019tshowingupI\u2019msorry.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Shouto looks at him with a hint of sadness. \u201cDo you remember what I told you?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Deku flushes. </span>\n<em>\n<span>Yeah, he remembers.</span>\n</em>\n<span> Katsuki glares at both of them. He probably heard that part, too.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cFor the record, I fucking hate both of you\u2013\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI know,\u201d Deku replies. \u201cI\u2026I know that.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI\u2019m not fucking finished!\u201d Katsuki interjects. Deku pushes into the wall a little more.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI\u2019d really fucking hate it though if I didn\u2019t have to see your dumbass faces every day.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>His face colors. \u201cFuck!\u201d He slams a hand onto the wall right next to Deku\u2019s head.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Shouto squeezes in next to Katsuki. \u201cI meant what I said\u2013I don\u2019t care if we\u2019re soulmates or not. I\u2019m in love with you.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cTodoroki, what in the fuck\u2013\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI was here to talk to him first, Bakugou.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cLike hell you were! He\u2019s not yours, fucking half-and-half asshole.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Deku shoulders his way between them before they start fighting. \u201cStop!\u201d They stop.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cKacchan, I\u2019d hate it if i didn\u2019t see you every day, too, and Shoucchan, I really like you, but if you have a soulmate\u2026sh-shouldn\u2019t you find them?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Shouto shakes his head. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter. I might never find them, after all.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cBut\u2013\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIt\u2019s my choice, isn\u2019t it?\u201d He asks with a hint of a smile on his lips.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOkay, fuck. I don\u2019t hate you, okay? And there\u2019s no way I\u2019m about to fucking lose to Todoroki.\u201d Kacchan elbows his way back in.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIt\u2019s not up to us,\u201d Shouto says, pushing back.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cChoose,\u201d Kacchan says, turning to Deku.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHuh?\u201d There\u2019s not a way for him to press any further into the wall. \u201cI, I like you\u2013both\u2013Um, I can\u2019t do something like that\u2013pleasedon\u2019tkillmekacchan.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Katsuki turns to walk off angrily.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWait! Um\u2026\u201d Both of them turn to stare at Deku again. \u201cI\u2013well,\u2013I thought maybe you could check me? For a mark. If it\u2019s there, maybe it would help.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Deku\u2019s fingers fumble at his school jacket. Shouto instinctively takes it when he pulls it off. Kacchan kicks the wall, not making eye contact. Deku\u2019s fingers fumble more as he reaches the buttons on his shirt. He hands that to Shouto, too, who\u2019s now staring off to the side and hiding his reddening face with one hand. Deku glances down his chest, trying not to think about how exposed he is. They\u2019re all guys, but\u2013</span>\n<em>\n<span>still.</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI don\u2019t see anything,\u201d he says hesitantly.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Shouto glances at him, then quickly looks away, the color of his face deepening. \u201cWhat about your back?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cMy\u2013uh, I haven\u2019t checked.\u201d He turns around, crossing his arms over his chest. \u201cIs there anything?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Deku tries to look over his shoulder, but he can only catch a sort of glimpse and has no idea what it is. The other two have a perfect view. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>The first answer Deku gets is Kacchan\u2019s \u201cFucking fuck!\u201d \u00a0The second is Shouto\u2019s quiet \u201cso it\u2019s both?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhat, uh, what is it?\u201d Deku asks, still trying to see what it is.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cPut your fucking shirt back on first.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>He takes it back from Shouto, and buttons it clumsily. Katsuki kicks the wall.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cEverything involved with you is so fucking complicated, Deku.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cShut up, Bakugou.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHow the fuck are you okay with this?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Shouto sighs. \u201cIt\u2019s supposed to be the three of us, okay?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Katsuki\u2019s eyes widen. He looks purely surprised for a moment, then they settle into his more usual expression of anger.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cFuck!\u201d Kacchan punctuates the word with another kick to the wall.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Shouto turns away from the angry blond. \u201c\u2018Zuku, the choice is still yours\u2026your mark looks like both mine and\u2026his, but it\u2019s your choice. I\u2019ll accept it.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cSh-Shouchan.\u201d Deku looks up, then bites his lip and looks away again. \u201cI need to th-think about this. I\u2019m sorry!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>He slips away sideways, and runs home. He can\u2019t look his mother in the eye as he pushes the door open. He glances once at the shape that twists around her wrist, and bites back any questions he has. He\u2019ll figure it out somehow. Somehow. Maybe. But he knows he can\u2019t keep running.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Midoriya Izuku is kept up that night by whirling thoughts. He\u2019s closer to Shouto. They\u2019re better friends. But it\u2019s not like he considers Katsuki an enemy. In fact, when he tries to think about a life where he doesn\u2019t hear Katsuki\u2019s \u201cfucking nerd\u201d at least once a week, it makes his stomach turn. When he thinks about Katsuki, he usually thinks about Katsuki yelling at him or pushing up against walls or punching him. Or angry with him\u2013and that\u2019s almost worse.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>When morning comes, he goes to school with dark shadows under his eyes and an attention span worse than it was in first grade. Shouto has to prod him several times before he answers the teacher\u2019s questions, and he can feel Katsuki\u2019s eyes drilling holes in him from the back. At lunch, he third wheels at Ochako and Asui\u2019s table. Ochako asks him once if he\u2019s talked to Katsuki or Shouto yet, but stops when she sees the borderline-traumatized expression on his face. She leaves him a pat on the shoulder and a \u201cit\u2019ll work out.\u201d He dearly hopes that\u2019s true.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>The next day is Sunday, and they have the day off. Sometimes, he\u2019d hang out with one of his friends, but Deku doesn\u2019t feel like it this week. He hears that Kirishima and Katsuki are hanging out, and he hangs his head. If Katsuki and Shouto forget about him, he\u2019ll understand. Maybe it would be easier that way. Deku shakes his head. He can\u2019t think like that. He\u2019ll work it out with his soulmates\u2013both of them. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>An hour later finds him standing in the bathroom twisted around so he can see his back. At first, he can\u2019t believe what he\u2019s seeing. It\u2019s so </span>\n<em>\n<span>gorgeous.</span>\n</em>\n<span> How could something that looks like that possibly be part of him? </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>There are wings that slope from his shoulderblades, one of fire, one of ice. A large circle of light hovers between them and countless other smaller ones sparkle across his back. As he looks, one of the stars explodes. There\u2019s no question of who the fire and ice is for.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>He reaches his hands around his shoulders to try and touch it. The flames wrap around his fingers. He can\u2019t feel any warmth, but the way the flicker makes them look so real. One of the stars pops in response. It turns into a burst of orange and red before going back to white. When he looks at his face, he sees a smile. Maybe he really does like both of them.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Deku sighs and rests his elbows on the bathroom sink. It would be simpler if he only had one soulmate. Or even zero. He had managed to get used to that idea, but two? Is that even possible? When he thinks about it, he wouldn\u2019t want to be parted from either of them. When he really thinks about it, he feels that way about a lot of his friends. But this is a different kind of doesn\u2019t-want-to-be-parted.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>He thought he had a crush on Ochako in their first year of high school, but the reddening of his cheeks stopped happening and the stutters in his heartbeat stuttered out. He likes her, of course, but not in anything other than a friendly sense. He figured out he liked Shouto. He doesn\u2019t think he likes Katsuki in quite the same way. Or does he? His mind supplies him an image from training one day when Katsuki either blew up or ripped off his shirt. Okay, maybe he does like Katsuki the same way.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>That doesn\u2019t make things easier. The two don\u2019t really seem to get along, and Deku is doubtful of whether they can learn. He remembers the red star-like shape on Shouto\u2019s chest. That could be an explosion. That could be Katsuki\u2019s. But Katsuki? He didn\u2019t think the rest looked like Shouto\u2019s. Or maybe it did. He can\u2019t even remember it clealry now.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Deku spends the rest of Sunday at home and looks at old news reports. Watching the glory days of the heroes he grew up hearing about is comforting. He pulls finds the clip where All Might saves hundreds of people alone and watches that, too.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>School returns on Monday. Deku slips a note onto Shouto\u2019s desk with the words \u201cTalk after school?\u201d and sends a glance behind him to where Katsuki sits. Katsuki glares at him for a moment, and Deku knows he\u2019ll be there too without even sending him a note. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>That\u2019s the plan, anyway, until the villains come crashing back into their lives. They\u2019ve been lucky, really, to have a few weeks of peace. In his concern over soulmates, he nearly forgot about villains. Nearly. But now he\u2019s almost thankful to have something else to focus on.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>The number of teachers present at training sessions has been increased, and so has the security of the individual facilities, but the villains manage to get in anyway. Deku finds himself frozen to the spot when he comes face-to-face with All For One for the second time. His blood turns to ice. In the second he hesitates, Shouto and Katsuki surge ahead of him. He catches up in an instant. They stand, all three together, for a moment.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cGo help the others!\u201d Deku yells, as he steps into the space between them.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>He doesn\u2019t have to look around to see their classmates fighting, to know that some of them are struggling. Their pro-hero teachers can\u2019t be everywhere at once, so Izuku prioritizes the safety of his classmates and sends the people he trusts the most to fight with them and tip the scales.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou better not fucking lose, before I come back to kick his ass!\u201d Katsuki yells over his shoulder.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Kacchan\u2019s yell bolsters his strength. And Deku can stand taller now and with a stronger heart.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cBe careful, \u2018Zuku!\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Shouto leaves with a pat on Deku\u2019s shoulder, and Deku almost wants to take hold of that hand and keep him from going. But he doesn\u2019t. This is an enemy he\u2019s destined to face. This is an enemy he has to face, even without All Might to stand next to him.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>He should anticipate the near-fatal injuries and the narrow victories by now. It doesn\u2019t matter that he has better control of his quirk and can use up to 10% of it without damaging himself. Sometimes, he doubts if 100% would be enough to let him win. They make it through with minimal injury\u2013no one dies. They make it through with One For All and Deku\u2019s self-sacrificing streak. They make it through with altogether too many yells of \u201cfuck\u201d from Katsuki. They make it through with Shouto\u2019s hand-curse finally acting on Tomura.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>They make it through but All For One escapes in the end. They\u2019ve suffered too many injuries to send anyone after him. When Deku tries, he\u2019s held back by two sets of arms. He just registers that there are two sets of warm hands before he collapses from exhaustion. He\u2019s getting used to using his quirk, but he\u2019s not there yet. He can\u2019t draw out enough of it\u2019s power. Really, they\u2019re lucky not to have lost anyone this time.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Deku wakes up hours later in a hospital bed that\u2019s more familiar than it should be. His eyes blink open under the bluish light that\u2019s left on in the middle of the night. His body feels heavy, and there are bandages everywhere. He didn\u2019t think he\u2019d been hurt that badly, but maybe he hadn\u2019t noticed in the heat of the moment. He tries to shift quietly, but there\u2019s a warm weight by his stomach.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>When he looks down, he sees the unmistakable half-white, half-red of Shouto\u2019s hair. Shouto stirs in his sleep, and Deku freezes. He didn\u2019t mean to wake his friend. As he looks longer, that position can\u2019t be comfortable. Shouto is on the tall side, and his back is arched over.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cShoucchan,\u201d Deku says, his voice a lot hoarser than he expected.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>His eyes meet Shouto\u2019s mismatched half-asleep ones a moment later. Shouto blinks once, twice, and then sits up quickly, rubbing his eyes.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201c\u2018Zuku, are you okay?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cY-yeah,\u201d he answers quickly. \u201cYou?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Shouto nods, suppressing a yawn. \u201cNothing Recovery Girl couldn\u2019t handle. I\u2019m just\u2013\u201d He yawns again. \u201cTired.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Shouto\u2019s eyes fall shut again, head still resting by Deku\u2019s side. Without thinking, he reaches his bandaged hand to run through the red half of Shouto\u2019s hair. He\u2019s met with those mismatched eyes again.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAh, sorry, Shoucchan! I just\u2013\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d he answers with a tired smile. \u201cI love you.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cShoucchan!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Deku can feel his heart pounding in his chest, especially as Shouto leans into his hand. He can\u2019t brush his fingers through Shouto\u2019s silky hair like he would if he wasn\u2019t bandaged within an inch of his life, but he can still feel the gentle weight. Shouto closes his own hand around Deku\u2019s bandaged one, rubbing his thumb over the strips of cotton.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNow go to sleep, we can talk to Bakugou in the morning.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIs he okay?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHe was snoring obnoxiously when I checked.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Deku laughs quietly. He\u2019ll be okay. They\u2019ll be okay. With those thoughts in mind, he drifts into a deep sleep.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>They wake when a nurse comes in and gasps much louder than necessary at their proximity. Shouto gets sent back to his own room rather rudely, but he shrugs it off. Deku has to endure a lot more poking and prodding and some checking of bandages, but then he\u2019s left alone again. When all the nurses and doctors are gone, he tests his legs slowly. He knows he\u2019s not in good shape, but if he can find enough strength to walk over to Kacchan\u2019s room, that\u2019ll be enough. When he opens the door, he finds Shouto leaning against the opposite wall.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Shouto already knows where Katsuki\u2019s room is, so it doesn\u2019t take long before they\u2019re standing in front of it. Deku hesitates, does he really want to see Kacchan? Yes, yes, he does. He opens the door and peers in side. Happy to see that the room is empty save for one very-angry looking blond, Deku opens the door the rest of the way.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cKacchan\u2013\u201d A glare cuts him off mid-sentence.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI\u2019m already in pain, and now I have to deal with both of you fuckwads. Great.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>He doesn\u2019t say anything about them leaving, though, so Deku takes that as a plus. He moves to stand at the foot of the bed, gaze darting from his childhood friend and then away.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAgh, fuck, stop doing that!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Deku\u2019s gaze jerks to Katsuki, and he holds it there.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIf you have something to say, spit it the fuck out.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Deku swallows. \u201cUh, well, I don\u2019t think this is the time\u2013\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI don\u2019t give a shit what you think. I\u2019m fucking sick and tired of sitting here, and the dumbshit mark on my hands is getting fucking clearer. So talk, you fucking nerd.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Deku looks at the floor. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIt\u2019s supposed to be the three of us, right? So let\u2019s\u2026let\u2019s try that.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>He feels Shouto\u2019s arms close around his waist and his head rest on his shoulder.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhat the fuck? Stop that!\u201d Katsuki gets out of bed with surprising speed and little care for the IV in his arm. \u201cYou better learn to share, half-ass.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Katsuki stands a little in front of them, pointing a finger into Shouto\u2019s face. Deku reaches his arms forward hesitantly to include Katsuki in their hug. The blond flinches at first, but doesn\u2019t back away. He inches forward and raises his own arms to reciprocate, muttering a \u201cI really fucking hate both of you.\u201d Shouto\u2019s eyes widen when he feels two hands on his back.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNice try, Katsu,\u201d Shouto smirks.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWho the fuck is \u2018Katsu?\u2019\u201d He asks, burying his head in Deku\u2019s unoccupied shoulder.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Deku laughs lightly into Katsuki\u2019s chest, ignoring the angry mumbling in his ear. Katsuki breaks away first, hand going to his bandaged ribcage.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cKacchan, are you alright?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI\u2019m fucking perfect, now get in bed before you collapse.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>He drags Deku gently\u2013well, sort of gently\u2013 to the hospital bed, ignoring all protests. They manage to settle, with a bunch of </span>\n<em>\n<span>ouches</span>\n</em>\n<span> and trying not to put weight on injuries. Deku\u2019s head rests on Shouto\u2019s chest, and Katsuki lies on his side, somehow managing not to fall off. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n<span>Maybe having two soulmates will work out, after all.</span>\n</p>"
