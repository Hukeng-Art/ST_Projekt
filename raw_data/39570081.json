Daily updates will resume until I have posted everything. I messed with this chapter for a long time, to the point that I have no idea whether or not it is any good. I hope you enjoy it!</p>",
  "notes": "<p>Hello...Welcome. This is what happened when an interesting character detail that I observed turned into a funny idea for a scene, and then that snowballed into basically a full-blown romance novel. It's not finished yet, but it's sitting at 25k words currently, so your comments are the sustenance that will give me the strength to complete it, preferably before Season 4 Volume 2 comes out and ruins it. Sex scenes will be in this, but I make no promises about them being any good. I only promise that they will contain jokes. I hope you enjoy!</p>\n<p>Also, I am coming back to add to this later.. Please come talk to me on tumblr! <a href=\"https://ao3soidade.tumblr.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">@ao3soidade</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://subbaculture.tumblr.com/post/695615427203792896/fic-covers-3\" rel=\"nofollow\">subbaculture</a> on tumblr created a wonderful book cover for this fic, which I am inserting below so you can enjoy the experience of seeing the cover before reading. Thank you subbaculture!</p>\n<p>Thank you, everyone, for all the lovely comments! I am almost done with the fic now, so I'm hoping I'll be able to post one chapter per day until it's finished. Your comments are keeping my skin clear, my dog fed, my crops flourishing, etc, etc. I love you all.</p>\n<p>\n(See the end of the chapter for <a href=\"#chapter_4_endnotes\">more notes</a>.)\n</p>\n<p>Please look up the cover of Accept\u2019s Balls to the Wall. The Accept pin on Eddie\u2019s vest is one of the pieces of evidence on my mental \u201cEddie is Gay\u201d conspiracy theory bulletin board, along with the black bandana, the handcuffs in his room, and various other things. I have connected the dots.</p>\n<p>Hi, hello. So. Bad news first, always: I am having some computer trouble. I'm currently posting this at work, but I am pushing the limits of what I could be caught posting and not lose my job. The next chapter would DEFINITELY get me fired (this is actually the good news.) Anyway, I have everything in google drive, so the worst case scenario would be that I am unable to post as early in the day as I have been. So if you don't spot the update in the morning tomorrow, don't worry! It is still coming; it just might have to be in the evening, after work, when I can borrow someone's computer.</p>\n<p>\n(See the end of the chapter for <a href=\"#chapter_5_endnotes\">more notes</a>.)\n</p>\n<p>For anyone not familiar, the movie they watched is Pink Flamingos. It\u2019s an interesting experience. The fact that they were still in the mood to make out after watching it is a testament to their attraction to each other.</p>\n<p>My computer...she is struggling. But here I am. For you. I am very nervous about posting this, so please be kind and gentle to me. Remember that I never promised that the sex scenes in this would be hot, only that they would have jokes. Personally, I think I delivered on that part at least.</p>\n<p>Thank you again for all the comments, and all the support on the last chapter! I have definitely been nervous about posting this in general, but especially that last one (and future ones such as chapter...10? Just to tease you all a bit.) Everyone's support has assuaged some of that anxiety and also made me so, so happy. I hope you like this chapter as well! It was one of my favorites to write.</p>\n<p>Hi all! I have been overwhelmed (in the best of ways) by the response to this fic. Thank you so much for all of your comments. I am replying to as many as I can, but there are definitely some slipping through the cracks. I also might have accidentally replied to some multiple times because I forgot that I already replied to them. Oops! </p>\n<p>Quick update on my progress with this fic: It is complete through chapter 11. All of the other chapters that I have planned are partially written. So, I will definitely be finishing this, but the updates might slow down a bit after chapter 11. I will spend some time this weekend trying to get myself caught up so that I am still able to post every day, but it might be a few more days between updates after Chapter 11. Currently I have 15 chapters and a short epilogue planned, but I may end up splitting them in different ways or adding things. I don't think it will be less than that. </p>\n<p>Thank you again for your comments and love!</p>\n<p>It's way too early in the morning for me to be posting content like this. I am blushing. I hope you enjoy, whatever your time zone.</p>\n<p>There is a mention of Indianapolis in this chapter. I have no idea how far it is from Hawkins because Hawkins is not real and there is no consensus on what part of Indiana it\u2019s in. Let\u2019s just assume it\u2019s kind of out of the way but not crazy far. It isn\u2019t that important, honestly.</p>\n<p>I struggled so hard to give Vickie a personality. I am sorry she\u2019s so bland; the writers really gave me NOTHING to work with. Robin is always a joy to write though, so I hope you like the chapter! Thanks for reading!</p>\n<p>\n(See the end of the chapter for <a href=\"#chapter_12_endnotes\">more notes</a>.)\n</p>\n<p>So, this is the last chapter I am finished with. All other chapters are partially written, and I have basically every scene planned, so don't worry. This WILL be finished. I am just at the end of my daily posting streak. I am also determined to get this finished and posted before Vol. 2 comes out and ruins it...</p>\n<p>Would you all be interested in reading more related to this fic, or unrelated Steddie stuff, even if Vol 2 puts all of it firmly in the AU category? I have some ideas of what I might want to write next. I will definitely need a break after finishing this one, but we probably have at least 2 years until Season 5 comes out, so we will need something to entertain us in the meantime! Let me know what you think!</p>\n<p>Just wanted to give a warning that this chapter will include discussions of past child abuse and trauma. Take care of yourselves!</p>\n<p>\n(See the end of the chapter for <a href=\"#chapter_14_endnotes\">more notes</a>.)\n</p>\n<p>It\u2019s sadboy hours. Do you need some period-appropriate music to cry to? Might I suggest:<br>Temptation - New Order (Steve\u2019s choice)<br>Losing More Than You\u2019ve Ever Had - Accept (Eddie\u2019s choice)<br>Damaged Goods - Gang of Four (My choice)<br>P.S. Please trust me. &lt;3</p>\n<p>\n(See the end of the chapter for <a href=\"#chapter_16_endnotes\">notes</a>.)\n</p>\n<p>Thank you all so much for reading! We are officially at the end of the line! I'm sorry the last chapter is such a short one, but I didn't want to pad it out just for the sake of length. I feel like I said what I wanted to say, and here we are at the end! Tomorrow I'm going to be posting a very brief epilogue, which is just a short scene that popped into my head that I had to put out there. Thanks to everyone for your support, your lovely comments, and your continued readership! I love you all!</p>\n<p>This is just a very brief scene that popped into my head, taking place some indeterminate amount of months in the future. If I decide to write a sequel to this fic, I reserve the right to retcon this epilogue out of existence.</p>\n<p>\n(See the end of the chapter for <a href=\"#chapter_17_endnotes\">more notes</a>.)\n</p>\n<p>Thank you so much for reading. I am so incredibly grateful to everyone who has read and commented on this! I can\u2019t believe how much attention it has gotten and I\u2019m so glad that so many people enjoyed it. I have some thoughts about possibly writing something else in this universe. The idea I have in mind would be starting shortly after this one ends (after chapter 16, hence possibly scrapping the epilogue,) but from Eddie\u2019s perspective this time. I have not fleshed the idea out enough to actually commit to writing it, but I hope I'll be able to! I also have other fic ideas, and some non-fanfic writing projects I want to devote some time to, so I\u2019m not sure when I will be posting something next! I am anticipating Volume 2 of Season 4 will break my heart, so I might need some time to recover from that! Thanks again, everyone. I\u2019ll see you in the next one!</p>\n<p>Edited to add on 7/20/22: Yes, volume 2 did break my heart but it won't stop me from writing more Steddie. Also, I made a tumblr specifically for talking about my fanfic and related topics, so please go follow me! ao3soidade.tumblr.com</p>",

His stupid car wasn\u2019t working, and his dad had promised to help him. It turned out that his dad\u2019s version of helping was to tell Steve what part he needed to get, and to leave him to figure it out himself from there. So Steve was out here with the hood up, in a t-shirt and an old, beat-up pair of jeans so he wouldn\u2019t ruin his good clothes, with a bandana tied around his forehead to keep the sweat out of his eyes. Because it was hot out. Of course it was hot out.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Everything Steve Harrington knew about fixing cars had been learned against his will. It was one of the things his dad had used to try to force them to bond. But any time Steve got something the slightest bit wrong, his dad had used it as an excuse to berate him. Not that he needed an excuse, but it was somehow worse. Steve figured his dad was just mad that Steve wasn\u2019t naturally great at the hobbies he wanted him to like. Father-son car \u201cbonding\u201d time was just another way for Steve\u2019s dad to reinforce what a disappointment he was.\u00a0</p>\n<p>So Steve felt some sense of vindication when, after almost an hour of messing around under the hood, he discovered that his dad was wrong. Sure, his dad hadn\u2019t actually looked at it, but he was still wrong, and Steve was right. And now he had to get to the hardware store to get the parts he needed. Without a working car. Great.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He wiped his face with the bandana and shoved it in his pocket, then messed with his hair for a minute. It wasn\u2019t going to look good without a shower and a blow dry, but he wasn\u2019t likely to see anyone he knew at the hardware store, so it didn\u2019t really matter.\u00a0</p>\n<p>It took longer than he expected to find what he needed, and by the time he did, the exhaustion of working on the car, the walk over, and the search had gotten to him. He stood outside the store, holding the plastic bag with his purchase, and took a deep breath, preparing for the walk back.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHarrington?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Great. Of course. He shouldn\u2019t have jinxed it by assuming he wasn\u2019t going to see anyone he knew. He turned to see Eddie Munson approaching him, eyes narrowed.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat are you doing here, Harrington?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Steve lifted his plastic bag, a strained smile on his face. He didn\u2019t feel like explaining himself. He and Eddie were friends, but Steve was in a mood.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cRiiiight,\u201d Eddie said slowly. He leaned back on his heels, looking behind Steve, then faced forward. \u201cListen, Harrington\u2026\u201d He trailed off, pulling on a strand of his long brown hair. He gave Steve a conspiratorial glance.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Steve asked. He wasn\u2019t really in the mood to talk, and he wished Eddie had picked up on that. There was no reason for Eddie to be able to pick up on the nuances of Steve\u2019s moods, though. They didn\u2019t have a whole lot of one-on-one conversations. Usually, when they hung out, there was some sort of social buffer, often in the form of Robin.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSo\u2026\u201d Eddie said. Steve hadn\u2019t been sure if Eddie was acting weird, because Eddie was a weird guy. But now he was pretty sure Eddie was being weird, because Eddie was one of the most talkative people he knew, next to Robin. And, for some reason, he seemed like he couldn\u2019t get out what he wanted to say. \u201cLook, I\u2019m just asking, okay? Not\u2013 I don't mean anything by it. But, uh.\u201d His eyes darted back and forth, then he leaned in close to Steve. Steve had gotten used to that, kind of. The guy had no concept of personal space. \u201cAre you flagging?\u201d Eddie finally finished.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Steve shook his head slowly, eyes narrowed. He had no idea what that meant. He had no answer. \u201cWhat?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Eddie leaned away from Steve, facing forward again and nodding. \u201cOkay, got it. That answers my question. Carry on.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat the hell are you talking about, Munson?\u201d Steve turned to him, brow furrowed.</p>\n<p>Eddie shook his head. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it.\u201d He looked behind Steve again. \u201cYou might want to take that bandana out of your back pocket, though.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Steve instinctively, immediately, pulled the bandana out of his pocket and examined it. It was just a plain gray bandana, maybe a little dirty but otherwise normal. \u201cWhy? What do you want me to do with it?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Eddie put his hands up in a shrug. \u201cI don\u2019t know. Shove it in there deep enough that it\u2019s not sticking out. Put it in your front pocket. Get rid of it. Just don\u2019t leave it like that.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Steve was bewildered. He had no idea what was going on. \u201cSeriously, what are you talking about?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Eddie stared at Steve for a moment, cocking his head. \u201cDo you need a ride?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Steve couldn\u2019t even complain about the non-answer because yes, he did very much need a ride. He sighed. \u201cYeah. Yeah, I do, actually.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Eddie gestured dramatically toward the parking lot, a smooth flourish with both arms. \u201cYour chariot awaits.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Once they were in Eddie\u2019s car and on their way, Steve had to ask again. It was too weird. \u201cSo, uh, what was that about?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat was what about?\u201d Eddie glanced over at Steve, his eyes wide and innocent. Steve didn\u2019t buy it for a second.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThe bandana thing,\u201d Steve said. \u201cThe question. You generally being super weird. What\u2019s flagging?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, that,\u201d Eddie said, as though he had completely forgotten it. \u201cIt\u2019s a gay thing. People might think you\u2019re gay.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you fucking with me?\u201d A bandana meant someone was gay? How? Why?\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNot at all, no.\u201d Eddie sounded serious, but Steve knew that Eddie was capable of a completely deadpan delivery, and Steve had fallen for it a number of times.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIf you\u2019re trying to make fun of me, you need to get better material, man. Jokes about people being gay are stale. And not cool.\u201d Steve of a few years ago would have been surprised to hear current Steve say that, but he had grown a lot. Not to mention his best friend was gay.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m pleased to hear you say that, Harrington. But no, I\u2019m not making fun of you. I\u2019m completely serious.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHow do you even know that?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Eddie took one hand off the steering wheel and pulled a black bandana from somewhere, waving it in Steve\u2019s face.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWait.\u201d Steve paused. Considered. \u201cAre you telling me that you\u2019re gay?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou catch on quick.\u201d Eddie smiled wryly.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWait,\u201d Steve started. Eddie was not what he pictured when he thought of a gay guy. But there was no one way that a gay person could look, obviously. Steve knew that. He had just never even considered the possibility. He was quickly reframing every time Eddie had invaded his personal space. Not that Eddie was into him or anything, it just felt different knowing that he <em> could </em>be into him. Different how, Steve hadn\u2019t quite decided. He would have to think about that more later. In the meantime, he needed to find a way to end his sentence. \u201cSo what, any guy with a bandana is gay?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNot necessarily.\u201d Eddie shrugged one shoulder. \u201cIt doesn't have to be a bandana, it can be basically any piece of cloth you want. It depends on the color, the placement, and there are generally context clues. The hardware store isn\u2019t typically a cruising spot, as far as I\u2019m aware.\u201d He grinned, seemingly amused by what he had said.\u00a0</p>\n<p>A cruising spot? Steve knew what cruising was. Or, he had at least vague knowledge of what cruising was from hearing about the movie <em> Cruising </em>with Al Pacino. Were there cruising spots in Hawkins? That Eddie knew about? Eddie went cruising? That thought made Steve\u2019s stomach feel weird for a reason he couldn\u2019t identify. Another thing to think about more later.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSo, how does it work? The bandana thing? The colors have different meanings or something?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, they\u2019re about, you know, what kind of stuff people are interested in doing.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Steve raised his eyebrows. \u201cLike what?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you ask one of your other gay friends?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat makes you think I have other gay friends?\u201d Steve said quickly. It sounded more defensive than he meant it to. It was just that Eddie knew basically all of his friends. If Steve hinted too much, Eddie would be able to guess.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, Robin told me you know about her, and she told me you guys have one other gay friend, but she wouldn\u2019t say who he is.\u201d</p>\n<p>Robin and Eddie had talked about this? And Robin had told him about Will?\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHe wouldn\u2019t know about this stuff,\u201d Steve said.\u00a0 Since the Byers had moved back, Will had opened up to Steve and Robin about being gay. Well, first, Robin had made Steve a co-conspirator in a campaign to spend more time just the three of them, so she could casually mention liking girls enough times to make Will feel comfortable. But Will was just a kid. He wouldn\u2019t know the answers to Steve\u2019s questions. Right? \u201cGod, I <em> hope </em>he doesn\u2019t know about this stuff.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d Steve said. He realized how weird that must have sounded. Like he had some kind of problem with gay sex, or cruising, or flagging. Which he <em> didn\u2019t, </em>he just really didn\u2019t want to think about those things in relation to Will. \u201cNot like\u2014 it\u2019s just because\u2014\u201c Steve didn\u2019t want to give too much away. Robin hadn\u2019t identified Will, so Steve knew he shouldn\u2019t either. \u201cHe\u2019s only fifteen.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLike most of your friends.\u201d Eddie nodded. \u201cSay no more.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Steve chose to ignore that. \u201cAnd even if he was old enough, I don\u2019t think he would be interested in that stuff. He\u2019s pretty hung up on one guy. Who\u2019s straight.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAh, yeah,\u201d Eddie said. \u201cBeen there.\u201d</p>\n<p>They pulled up to Steve\u2019s house then, so Steve didn\u2019t get a chance to ask any more questions. He got out of Eddie\u2019s car, then turned toward Eddie.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThanks for the ride,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd the tip. About the, uh, bandana.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAny time, Harrington,\u201d Eddie said, grinning again.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Steve decided not to think about any of the things he had talked about with Eddie, or any of the weird feelings he\u2019d had because of them. That was too much for today. He still had to finish fixing up his car, and after that, all he wanted to do was pass out.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He shoved the thoughts to the back of his mind, locked them in a box with all the other times he had looked at a guy and felt funny. It wasn\u2019t something he was ready to address. Maybe he wouldn\u2019t ever be ready to address it.</p>\n<p>\n<span>The next morning, Steve took his newly fixed car to pick up Robin for work. It was summer now. Robin had graduated, and was heading to college in the fall, but he at least had the summer with his best friend, working at Family Video.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>He and Robin had a few minutes of small talk, but when there was a lull in the conversation, Steve decided to take a shot.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHey, Rob,\u201d he said, trying his hardest to keep his voice casual. \u201cDo you know what flagging is?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYeah. I mean, kind of? Why do you ask?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIt\u2019s like\u2026\u201d she thought for a moment. \u201cIt\u2019s a code. For gay people to find casual sex, without straight people knowing what it means. So they take a handkerchief, or a bandana, or whatever, and the color means what you want to do, and the side it\u2019s on means if you\u2019re a top or a bottom. Where did you even hear about that?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cFrom Eddie.\u201d He glanced at her. \u201cBy the way, why didn\u2019t you tell me Eddie is gay?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cUh,\u201d Robin said sarcastically. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you tell people I\u2019m gay?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThat\u2019s different!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHow is it different?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>She had him there. \u201cOkay, good point.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI still don\u2019t understand what happened. Eddie told you he\u2019s gay? And the hanky code came up in conversation somehow?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Steve sighed. \u201cI had a bandana in my pocket. Eddie asked if I was flagging, I had no idea what he meant, and then he explained. Kind of. That\u2019s why I had to ask you.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOh my god,\u201d Robin said, her voice rising in volume. \u201cWas Eddie hitting on you? Was he, like, </span>\n<em>\n<span>propositioning </span>\n</em>\n<span>you?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Wait, was he? \u201cNo,\u201d Steve remembered. \u201cBefore he asked, he specifically said he was just asking. And he told me the hardware store isn\u2019t a good cruising spot.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Robin laughed. \u201cWhat were you even doing at the hardware store?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cDo you see this car you\u2019re riding in? This well-oiled, perfectly-running machine?\u201d Steve pointed to himself. \u201cI did that. I fixed it, all by myself.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cPull over,\u201d Robin said, reaching for the door. \u201cI\u2019m finding another ride.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHa ha,\u201d Steve said flatly. \u201cVery funny.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>They got to work shortly after and set up to open the store. It would be a little while before the customers started to come in, so Steve decided to ask some more questions while he had the chance.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cSo, the colors. Do you know what they mean?\u201d He asked, trying to sound casual again.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cColors?\u201d Robin looked up from the computer, confused. \u201cWhat colors? What are you talking about?\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThe\u2014\u201c Steve waved his hand around. \u201cBandana thing. Flagging.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOh, are we still on that?\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI\u2019m just wondering!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhat color bandana were you wearing?\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cGray.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhich pocket was it in?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cRight.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOh.\u201d Robin nodded. \u201cHmmmm.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cSo what does that mean?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI have no idea.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cRobin! I thought you said you knew about this stuff!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI mean, I know about it </span>\n<em>\n<span>vaguely</span>\n</em>\n<span>. I don\u2019t use it! I didn\u2019t even realize Eddie used it. What color was his bandana?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cBlack, but I didn\u2019t see what pocket it was in.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOh,\u201d Robin said, raising her eyebrows. \u201cI see.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Finally, they were getting somewhere. \u201cWhat does the black bandana mean?\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAlso no idea.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cRobin, come on!\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhy do you even need to know all this?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI don\u2019t </span>\n<em>\n<span>need</span>\n</em>\n<span> to,\u201d Steve said. \u201cI\u2019m just curious.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOkay.\u201d Robin\u2019s eyebrows were still raised. She looked at Steve in a way that seemed very pointed, but he wasn\u2019t sure what she meant by it. \u201cCurious. Got it.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhat\u2019s that supposed to mean?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Steve didn\u2019t get a response, because at that moment the bell on the door jingled. Customers. Back into work mode.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Later, when there were only a few people around, Steve walked casually over to the action section and found the movie </span>\n<em>\n<span>Cruising</span>\n</em>\n<span>. He had never actually seen it, but now he was wondering about the plot, and how it connected to the title. And how that connected to what Eddie had told him.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cCome on,\u201d Steve muttered to himself after reading the description on the back of the box. \u201cHis name is </span>\n<em>\n<span>Steve? </span>\n</em>\n<span>Seriously?\u201d Al Pacino\u2019s character was a cop who had to go undercover to gay S&amp;M clubs. Named Steve. And it seemed to hint that going undercover cruising awakened something in cop Steve, which might cause some sort of conflict with his girlfriend, </span>\n<em>\n<span>Nancy</span>\n</em>\n<span>. That was too much of a coincidence. He had to watch the movie now, right? He hoped it didn\u2019t awaken anything in him like it did with cop Steve.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhat are you doing, Harrington?\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Steve put down the tape and whirled around to find Eddie Munson leaning over him. He was just a little too close, as usual.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI\u2019m working,\u201d Steve said. \u201cPutting stuff away. What are you doing here?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Eddie held up a tape in answer to Steve's question, then looked at the row of movies behind Steve. \u201cJust putting stuff away, huh?\u201d He said. \u201cI thought maybe you were doing some research.\u201d He bit his lip, holding back a smile, and his eyes flicked over to the </span>\n<em>\n<span>Cruising </span>\n</em>\n<span>tape.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cResearch?\u201d Without turning, Steve reached over to straighten up some tapes. \u201cI\u2019m just fixing these tapes.\u201d He heard one clatter to the ground. \u201cWhat research would I be doing?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWell,\u201d Eddie said, tilting his head and locking eyes with Steve. \u201cYou seemed pretty curious the other day.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI mean\u2014\u201c Steve looked away. Eddie\u2019s eye contact was a little too intense for his liking. \u201cI guess.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou still want to know?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYeah,\u201d Steve said. Then, afraid he had responded too quickly, he added, \u201cI guess. It doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Eddie raised an eyebrow. \u201cSo you don\u2019t want to know? What your bandana meant?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>He really, really did, and he didn\u2019t know why it mattered so much. \u201cSure.\u201d He looked back at Eddie, who was still staring at him intensely, and then looked away again.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cSure.\u201d Eddie smirked, nodded once. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you, then.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOkay.\u201d Steve looked at Eddie. He held the eye contact this time, his heart beating fast. \u201cTell me.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Eddie leaned in. His long hair touched Steve\u2019s shoulder, and he tilted his head to get his mouth close to Steve\u2019s ear. His voice was barely audible, forcing Steve to tilt his head even closer so he could hear.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIt means you like to be tied up.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Steve felt more than heard what Eddie said. He inhaled sharply, which he hoped Eddie didn\u2019t hear. He also hoped Eddie didn\u2019t see the goosebumps that immediately popped up, trailing down from Steve\u2019s neck, where he still felt Eddie\u2019s breath.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Eddie leaned away, grinning, and took a step back. He spoke in a normal tone of voice. \u201cSee you around, Harrington.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Shit. He didn\u2019t even need the fucking movie to awaken something in him. He was in trouble.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Steve and Robin were going to a party at the Byers house. He supposed he should call it the Byers-Hopper house, because the pair were officially cohabiting. This weekend, though, Joyce and Hopper were out of town, and the Byers boys were having a party. Jonathan and Will were </span>\n<em>\n<span>good </span>\n</em>\n<span>boys though, so they had actually managed to get permission for this party, on the conditions that it stayed small, and that there would be no underage drinking. Steve hoped that second rule wasn\u2019t going to be followed </span>\n<em>\n<span>too </span>\n</em>\n<span>stringently. He had barely hung out with Nancy while Jonathan was there, at least not when they weren't fighting monsters, and the thought made him nervous.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>When Steve and Robin arrived, there were already a few cars parked outside of the Byers\u2019 new house. Some looked familiar, but he couldn\u2019t quite place them. Despite his amazing feat of repair work the previous week, Steve still didn\u2019t give a shit about cars.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Steve knocked, and was surprised when the door was opened by Jonathan\u2019s long-haired stoner friend.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHey!\u201d Steve said, plastering a smile on his face. \u201cIt\u2019s\u2026you!</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHey yourself, man!\u201d Jonathan\u2019s friend said, wrapping Steve in a hug that went on just a little bit too long for someone whose name Steve couldn\u2019t even remember.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>He rounded on Robin next, but she managed to dodge. \u201cHey Argyle! Good to see you!\u201d </span>\n<em>\n<span>Argyle</span>\n</em>\n<span>. Steve wasn\u2019t sure how he had forgotten that name; it was genuinely one of the weirdest things about his spring break. Who named their kid Argyle? \u201cYou\u2019re visiting?\u201d Robin asked.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYeah, dude, I just flew in. Had to see the new digs, see all of you lovely people, hang out in Hawkins for a while.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cGreat,\u201d Robin said. \u201cWhere are\u2013\u201d She peered around Argyle and into the house.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOh, yeah, come on in. Everyone\u2019s out in the yard.\u201d Argyle ushered them through the living room and out to the back yard.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Steve scanned the yard, scoping out the party. Dustin and Will were talking nearby. Couples were coupled up\u2013 Max and Lucas, El and Mike, Nancy and Jonathan. Ugh. There was music playing from a small boombox, and next to it sat Eddie, looking through a pile of tapes.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Steve and Robin walked over to Eddie. \u201cAnything good?\u201d Steve asked, gesturing toward the cassettes.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cFor a certain value of good,\u201d Eddie said. \u201cNot my thing, but not bad.\u201d He put down the last tape and looked up at Robin and Steve. \u201cWhere have you two been?\u201d\u00a0\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYeah, I can\u2019t believe we\u2019d be the last ones to arrive at a sober party full of mostly high school sophomores.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThe sophomores are sober, but we don\u2019t have to be.\u201d Eddie stood. \u201cI\u2019m gonna get a beer, you guys want one?\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI thought there was no underage drinking allowed.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI\u2019m twenty-one.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWait, you were supposed to graduate the year before me, right?\u201d Steve did some quick math in his head. \u201cSo you should only be a year older than me. I\u2019m nineteen.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWell, apparently I\u2019m two years older.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhy?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhy?\u201d Eddie looked incredulous. \u201cBecause I was born two years before you. It really doesn\u2019t matter, Harrington. Do you want a beer or not?\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYeah,\u201d Steve said. He was glad that someone had brought drinks, though surprised that Jonathan would risk Hopper\u2019s wrath.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cRobin?\u201d Eddie asked.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cSure,\u201d she said, avoiding Steve\u2019s surprised glance.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Eddie walked off to get the drinks.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou\u2019re drinking?\u201d Steve asked Robin. \u201cYou never drink at parties.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNot </span>\n<em>\n<span>never</span>\n</em>\n<span>,\u201d she said. \u201cJust\u2026rarely. I need to calm my nerves.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhat are you nervous about? There are like six people here.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThere are twelve,\u201d Robin corrected. \u201cAnd hopefully Vickie will be the thirteenth.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhat? You invited Vickie?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYeah. I told you I was going to.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNo, you didn\u2019t.\u201d Steve was sure he would have remembered that.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYes, I did,\u201d Robin insisted. \u201cYou just forgot.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou didn\u2019t tell me,\u201d Steve said. \u201cBecause if you had told me, I wouldn\u2019t have wanted to come be a third wheel. And if I didn\u2019t come, you wouldn\u2019t have a ride.\u201d His eyes widened as it dawned on him. \u201cYou tricked me!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Robin looked guilty.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI can\u2019t believe you tricked me so you could bring a date!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIt\u2019s not a date.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOf course it\u2019s a date. You like her, don\u2019t you?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cShhh.\u201d Robin looked around to make sure no one was listening. \u201cYeah, but if it\u2019s a date, she doesn\u2019t know about it.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cFine, it\u2019s not technically a date. But I\u2019m still going to be majorly third wheeling. Who am I supposed to hang out with when everyone\u2019s all paired off?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNot </span>\n<em>\n<span>everyone\u2019s</span>\n</em>\n<span> paired off. You\u2019ve got Dustin and Will.\u201d She pointed at them. \u201cArgyle.\u201d A dark haired girl walked out of the house and greeted Argyle with a kiss. \u201cOkay, maybe not Argyle. But there\u2019s Eddie,\u201d she finished, gesturing to Eddie as he reappeared in front of them.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhat about me?\u201d He asked, handing them their beers. Steve opened his and took a swig.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cSteve was saying he wouldn\u2019t have anyone to hang out with if I was busy talking to Vickie.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou wound me, Harrington.\u201d Eddie put a hand over his heart, staggering backward theatrically. \u201cAm I not good enough company for you?\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNo,\u201d Steve said quickly. \u201cIt\u2019s not that. It\u2019s just\u2014she tricked me.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIt was for love,\u201d Eddie said mock-seriously. \u201cShe had to do it. I\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t try to stop her. I thought the end justified the means.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWait, did you know about this?\u201d Did Robin really tell Eddie about her date before Steve?</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Eddie put his hands up in a gesture of surrender. \u201cI must admit,\u201d he said in the same dramatic tone. \u201cI did.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou two were conspiring against me. I can\u2019t believe it.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cMaybe I was just conspiring to get you alone,\u201d Eddie said. His head was tilted down and he looked up at Steve through his eyelashes. Steve couldn\u2019t tell if this was part of the bit, if he was still joking around. He didn\u2019t want to respond to it without knowing, so he killed some time by taking a long drink of his beer, and then decided to ignore it.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou owe me big time,\u201d he said to Robin. \u201cI\u2019m serious.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOkay, yes, absolutely.\u201d Robin wasn\u2019t paying attention. \u201cHey, Vickie!\u201d She said as she walked away, toward the girl who had just arrived.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cUnbelievable,\u201d Steve said. He took another drink.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAre you actually mad?\u201d Eddie asked. \u201cI thought you\u2019d be happy for her.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>That made Steve feel guilty. \u201cI am,\u201d he said. \u201cIt just feels weird, being around all these couples when you\u2019re single, you know?</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI know,\u201d Eddie said.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Of course. It had to be even more difficult for Eddie, knowing that he couldn\u2019t bring a date most places. Steve was pretty sure that most of the group here would accept it if he did, but he knew that wasn\u2019t the case everywhere. Especially not in Hawkins.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cSorry,\u201d Steve said. He drained the rest of his beer and set down the empty can.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Eddie took a pack of cigarettes out of one of his jacket pockets.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThose things will kill you,\u201d Steve said, glad for the change of subject.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI\u2019m sure something else will beat them to it,\u201d Eddie said. \u201cJoin me?\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Steve considered for a moment. \u201cSure,\u201d he said. Fuck it.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>They walked over to the side of the house. It was far enough away that they couldn\u2019t hear other people talking, could barely hear the music.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Eddie opened the pack of cigarettes. He took one out and handed it to Steve, who placed it between his lips. Eddie lifted his lighter, holding eye contact while he lit Steve\u2019s cigarette for him. Steve found it hard to look away. He pulled the smoke deep into his lungs, then exhaled. Steve didn\u2019t smoke often\u2014he was an athlete all through high school, after all\u2014-but he had to admit he liked it.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>He liked the way Eddie was looking at him, too, but he wasn\u2019t quite ready to admit that yet. That day in the video store had brought some things to the surface\u2013 some things that Steve had tried to bury a long time ago. And when Eddie looked at him like that, he thought that maybe they had been rising to the surface for a while. Maybe since spring break.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Steve had to say something. He had to break the tension, because if it kept building he wouldn\u2019t know what to do with it.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI can\u2019t believe Robin tricked me and I\u2019m not even going to be able to get drunk,\u201d Steve said. \u201cHow much beer do they have?\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Eddie had lit his own cigarette, and took a drag before replying. \u201cNot a ton. They\u2019re monitoring it very closely so the kids don\u2019t get their hands on any, but it\u2019s pretty much only four people drinking.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOnly four?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cArgyle doesn\u2019t drink. I don\u2019t know about his girlfriend. I haven\u2019t really met her yet.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cArgyle doesn\u2019t drink? The guy smokes weed like most people drink water, and he won\u2019t drink alcohol?\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cSays it\u2019s bad for you.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Steve shook his head. \u201cThat guy is so weird.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI think he\u2019s hilarious.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Steve was surprised. Eddie was so intense, and Argyle was the complete opposite. He wouldn\u2019t have expected the two to get along. But, Steve figured, Argyle visiting was probably single-handedly keeping Eddie in business, so maybe that was why he liked him.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>They stood smoking in silence for a while, then Steve felt something bump against his arm. It was Eddie\u2019s hand, holding a flask. \u201cHere,\u201d he said.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou were holding out on me, Munson.\u201d Steve smiled at him. \u201cMade me think we only had shitty beer.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNah,\u201d he said. \u201cShitty liquor, too. I didn\u2019t want to take it out in front of the kids. Go ahead.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAre you trying to get me drunk, Munson?\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cMaybe.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Steve took a swig. \u201cUgh, what\u2019s in here, rubbing alcohol?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Eddie shrugged. \u201cClose enough.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI\u2019m supposed to drive,\u201d Steve said. All that talk about wanting to get drunk, and he almost forgot he had to get himself and Robin home after the party.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI got your back. Just don\u2019t drink all of that. You might go blind.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIs that a challenge?\u201d Steve raised an eyebrow.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIt really isn\u2019t.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Steve took another swig. \u201cUgh.\u201d It was disgusting.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIf you don\u2019t like it, don\u2019t drink it.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIs </span>\n<em>\n<span>that </span>\n</em>\n<span>a challenge?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cTrust me, Harrington, you\u2019ll know when I\u2019m issuing a challenge.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Steve turned to him. \u201cOh yeah?\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYeah.\u201d Eddie looked at him, grinning as he spoke. \u201cYou\u2019ll see my calling card.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhat\u2019s your calling card?\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI'm not saying. A man\u2019s gotta have a little mystery.\u201d He looked away from Steve, threading his fingers into his long hair.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThen how will I know it was you?\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOh, you\u2019ll know it when you see it.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll keep an eye out for it.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNo, don\u2019t keep an eye out. That won\u2019t do any good. It\u2019s coming when you least expect it.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Steve turned toward Eddie. He tried to keep the smile off his face, to keep up with Eddie\u2019s deadpan delivery, but he felt his lips curling upward. \u201cThat\u2019s </span>\n<em>\n<span>too </span>\n</em>\n<span>mysterious. Give me something to work with here.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI gave you the flask,\u201d Eddie said. Eddie put his hand over Steve\u2019s, the one holding the flask, and pushed it lightly into Steve\u2019s chest.\u00a0 \u201cWork with that.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Steve took another drink. \u201cSo you </span>\n<em>\n<span>are </span>\n</em>\n<span>trying to get me drunk.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI don\u2019t hear you complaining.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Steve heard someone clear their throat. He jumped away from Eddie, suddenly aware of how close they had been standing.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cUm.\u201d It was Robin. Steve slipped the flask into his jacket pocket so Robin wouldn\u2019t see it. \u201cThere\u2019s pizza.\u201d She pointed over her shoulder. \u201cFood\u2019s here. Steve, can I talk to you for a second?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Eddie put out his cigarette. \u201cI\u2019ll go get some pizza,\u201d he said.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d Steve asked after Eddie left. \u201cEverything okay with Vickie?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cEverything\u2019s great with Vickie, actually,\u201d she said, though she didn\u2019t look happy.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThen what did you need to talk about?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cFirst of all\u2026\u201d she yanked the cigarette out of his hand and threw it on the ground, stomping it out with her boot. \u201cGross.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHey, you didn\u2019t do that to Eddie.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cSpeaking of Eddie,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s the second thing. Why are you flirting with him?\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Steve scoffed. \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d He thought back on his conversation with Eddie. \u201cHow long were you standing there?\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cLong enough,\u201d she said. \u201cI have seen you flirt with every girl who ever comes into our store. I know all your moves. All your tricks. I know what you look like when you\u2019re flirting.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI\u2019m not gay, Robin.\u201d Saying it felt weird. Like maybe it wasn\u2019t the truth somehow. But Steve knew he liked women, loved women. So why did it feel\u2026off?</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIf you\u2019re so </span>\n<em>\n<span>not gay</span>\n</em>\n<span>, why are you flirting with Eddie? Don\u2019t mess with him, Steve.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI\u2019m not messing with him! I\u2019m not a total asshole, Robin. Seriously, we\u2019re just talking. We were having a really nice conversation. Completely platonically.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOkay\u2026\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIf I decide to flirt with Eddie Munson, you\u2019ll be the first to know.\u201d That was a lie. Robin had pointed it out, and now Steve saw it too. He was flirting with Eddie Munson. He had no idea why, and he certainly didn\u2019t want to talk to Robin about it. At least not now. Not here. \u201cGo have fun with Vickie,\u201d Steve said. \u201cI\u2019ll be fine.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Steve walked back over to the rest of the group. He saw Eddie, with a slice of pizza on a paper plate, talking to Dustin. He headed over to them.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHey guys,\u201d Steve said, raising his hand in a wave.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHey, Harrington,\u201d Eddie said. \u201cYou should get some food. Soak up some of that alcohol.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhat alcohol?\u201d Dustin asked. \u201cI thought there wasn\u2019t any alcohol here.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNo alcohol that </span>\n<em>\n<span>you</span>\n</em>\n<span> know of,\u201d Eddie said. He shot Steve a conspiratorial smile.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThat\u2019s not fair,\u201d Dustin said. He looked at Steve. \u201cCome on, don\u2019t try to tell me that you never drank at our age. Wouldn\u2019t you rather we do it under your supervision? Where it\u2019s safe?\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNice try, Henderson,\u201d Steve said. He sat down next to Dustin. \u201cDon\u2019t drink. It\u2019s bad for you.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Eddie handed Steve his plate. \u201cHere, have this. I didn\u2019t eat any yet. I\u2019ll go get another one.\u201d He wandered off toward the table where the food and drinks were.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Steve was starting to wonder why Eddie kept doing stuff for him tonight. Was he always like that? Steve thought about it. Eddie was a generally nice person. He liked to help his friends. Was that what this was, or was it something else?\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAre you drunk already, Steve? You got here like twenty minutes ago.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Steve realized he had been staring at Eddie, not paying any attention to Dustin. He checked his watch. \u201cHalf an hour,\u201d he corrected.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThat\u2019s still pretty fast.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI\u2019m not drunk,\u201d Steve said. He wasn\u2019t, not from one beer and a few swigs of something stronger. But he could feel the alcohol relaxing him, making him feel a little lighter, like maybe he could have fun at this party despite Robin ditching him, and despite the weird conversation they had just had.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhy are you just staring off into space, then?\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>He wasn\u2019t. He was very much staring at Eddie, and he wasn\u2019t really even trying to hide it at this point. But he was still glad that Dustin hadn\u2019t realized. He looked over at Dustin. \u201cJust thinking.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAbout what?\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNothing you need to worry about, Henderson.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Dustin glanced over at Nancy and Jonathan, then back at Steve. That was fine. Let Dustin think Steve was staring off into the distance because he was jealous of Nancy and Jonathan, not because he was staring at Eddie Munson\u2019s ass. Which he wasn\u2019t, actually. He was just looking for the black bandana, to see if it was in his pocket today. It wasn\u2019t, at least not visibly, and Steve definitely did not keep looking after he had realized that. Because he wasn\u2019t gay. He took another swig from the flask, turning away from Dustin to hide it from him.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Eddie came back with more pizza, and Steve remembered that he should be eating. He let Dustin and Eddie carry the conversation for a while, and he let the pizza be an excuse for his silence. After a while, Dustin looked over at Will, who was sitting alone. Will was staring too, at Mike and El. Dustin frowned.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI\u2019m gonna go check on Will,\u201d he said. He stood and started walking over, leaving Steve and Eddie alone again.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Eddie and Steve watched the two boys for a moment, Dustin approaching Will, talking to him, trying to make him laugh, and Will still shooting occasional glances over at Mike. As they watched, Steve offered Eddie the flask again.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Eddie took a drink, then handed it back. \u201cOkay, that\u2019s my last one. If I\u2019m gonna be driving you home, I should stop. Keep it.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Steve took another drink. The flask had been almost full when Eddie gave it to him, and now it was half empty.\u00a0\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>So.\u201d Eddie gestured over toward Will and Dustin. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on there?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI, uh\u2013\u201d Steve knew he shouldn\u2019t talk about it. Will had told him those things in confidence. \u201cI can\u2019t really say.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWill\u2019s your other gay friend?\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Steve gave an exaggerated shrug. \u201cI can neither confirm or deny.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYeah, I figured it was Will.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t make assumptions based on stereotypes, Munson.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWho said it was based on stereotypes? Now you\u2019re the one stereotyping Will.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOh, I\u2013\u201d Steve thought for a moment. </span>\n<em>\n<span>Was</span>\n</em>\n<span> he stereotyping Will? He assumed that Eddie had guessed because Will was sensitive and artistic, not to mention he was the only boy in that group without a girlfriend. Those were stereotypes, weren\u2019t they? Shit. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Eddie slapped him on the back. \u201cIt\u2019s fine, Harrington. I was just messing with you. I guessed because of the way he looks at Mike Wheeler. He\u2019s not subtle.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Steve looked over at Will, who was looking at Mike again. Steve winced. \u201cYeah, you\u2019re right. He\u2019s really not.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Eddie sat, staring intensely at Will and Dustin. \u201cMaybe I should talk to him.\u201d He sounded serious, somber, different from the lighthearted conversation they\u2019d been having most of the night.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAbout being gay?\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYeah, maybe. I don\u2019t know.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI think it\u2019s a good idea. Let him know, you know, it gets easier.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Eddie laughed dryly, without humor. \u201cI can\u2019t really tell him that.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Steve felt a pang. He knew it must have been hard for Eddie, must still be hard, but he really didn\u2019t know </span>\n<em>\n<span>how</span>\n</em>\n<span> hard. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he said again.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIt\u2019s whatever.\u201d Eddie stared at his hands, fiddling with his rings. \u201cWill\u2019s from a good family. He\u2019s got good friends\u2026\u201d Eddie trailed off.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI\u2019ve never met him, but I heard his dad\u2019s a real piece of shit.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWell,\u201d Eddie said. \u201cSomething else I can talk to him about.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Steve stared. Was Eddie saying that he could relate to that? That his dad was also a piece of shit? Eddie had never mentioned his parents. Steve had sort of assumed Eddie had always lived with his uncle. But he must have had parents at some point. Should Steve ask?</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>He didn\u2019t get a chance. Eddie interrupted his thoughts. \u201cAnyway, I\u2019m just saying, he has a support system. It won\u2019t be easy, but he\u2019ll be fine. He won\u2019t turn out like me.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Steve looked over at Eddie, trying to catch his eye again. \u201cI don\u2019t think you turned out so bad.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOh, Harrington,\u201d Eddie said. The light tone was back, and there was a small smile on his face. \u201cYou have </span>\n<em>\n<span>no idea</span>\n</em>\n<span> how bad I can be.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Steve\u2019s heart was beating way too fast. Had he had too much to drink? Had he not had enough to drink? He drank from the flask again, as though that might help him figure out how to navigate the feelings he was having.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cMaybe you can show me sometime,\u201d Steve heard himself say.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Eddie held eye contact with Steve for a moment, smiling wickedly, and then he stood up.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI\u2019m gonna go talk to Will,\u201d Eddie said. Steve watched him walk away, confused.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Steve felt someone sit down next to him, and turned to find Nancy. \u201cOh, hey, Nance.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHey, Steve. How\u2019s it going?\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou want a beer?\u201d She held a can out to him.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cUh.\u201d Steve felt like maybe he should stop, but Nancy didn\u2019t know how much he\u2019d already had to drink. And she had already brought one over. What was she going to do with it if he didn\u2019t take it? \u201cSure,\u201d he said.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWho\u2019s Robin\u2019s friend?\u201d Nancy asked, gesturing toward Robin and Vickie.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOh, Vickie,\u201d Steve said. He cracked open his beer and took a drink. \u201cThey were in band together. I don\u2019t know her that well.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIs that why you\u2019re not hanging out with them? You and Robin are usually inseparable.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cRobin and I aren\u2019t dating,\u201d Steve said instinctively.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI know, Steve,\u201d Nancy said. \u201cYou\u2019ve both made that very clear.\u201d She paused. \u201cAre you seeing anyone?\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Steve was caught off guard by that. \u201cUh, not seriously. Why do you ask?\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Nancy shrugged. \u201cWell, you\u2019re not dating Robin, but she\u2019s the only girl you ever bring around to hang out with everyone. So I was just wondering.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Steve went on dates, but there was no one he liked enough to introduce to his friends. \u201cI\u2019m not looking for anything serious right now.\u201d More like not </span>\n<em>\n<span>finding </span>\n</em>\n<span>anything serious, but still.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWell, I hope you find the girl for you, Steve. You deserve it.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cUh, thanks.\u201d Nancy had definitely been drinking, too. It had made her sentimental. Steve looked around for an escape from this conversation, and he made eye contact with Eddie, who started waving him over. \u201cOh.\u201d Steve nudged Nancy\u2019s arm and then pointed at Eddie. \u201cI should\u2013\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cGo ahead.\u201d Nancy smiled. \u201cWe\u2019ll talk later.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>He gave Nancy an awkward wave as he walked away.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Dustin had wandered off to talk to Max and Lucas, so it was just Will and Eddie when Steve got there.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThanks,\u201d Steve said. \u201cThat was super awkward.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYeah, I bet,\u201d Eddie said. \u201cEx-girlfriends, huh?\u201d He looked at Will. \u201cDo you have any?\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Will looked confused, and a little flustered. \u201cNo?\u201d He looked at Steve, who shrugged.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cMe neither,\u201d said Eddie.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cSeriously?\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNot really my thing.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Steve caught Will\u2019s eye and raised his eyebrows. Will, brow furrowed, shook his head.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Eddie let that hang for a second, and then he changed the subject. \u201cHave you seen the new </span>\n<em>\n<span>Creature Catalog</span>\n</em>\n<span>?\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Steve had no idea what that meant, but apparently Will did. \u201cWhy would you need that when there\u2019s already the </span>\n<em>\n<span>Monster Manual</span>\n</em>\n<span>?\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Nonsense. Steve refused to believe that any of these things were real.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cBut the </span>\n<em>\n<span>Monster Manual</span>\n</em>\n<span> is only for AD&amp;D,\u201d Eddie pointed out.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYeah, but why would I want to play with the old rules when there are updated ones?\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Okay, Steve realized. This was about their dragon game. He still had no idea what they were talking about.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Eddie gave an exaggerated gasp. \u201cYou can\u2019t be serious. You have to return to the classic at least some of the time!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cBut the added complexity of the new rules makes it more challenging, which also makes it more fun.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Steve absolutely could not listen to any more of this. He tuned them out, looking around the party. Nancy and Jonathan were arm in arm, talking to Argyle and his girlfriend. Fine. Robin and Vickie stood in a dark corner of the yard, standing very close together as they talked. Good for Robin. Mike and El were making out. Gross. Dustin and Max were engaged in some sort of heated argument as Lucas looked on warily. It seemed weird that everyone was separated into little groups at such a small party, but he realized the older and younger groups didn\u2019t really hang out together unless they were fighting monsters. Except for Steve. Steve was friends with everyone. Eddie kind of was too, after spring break.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Steve must have been watching the others for a while, because when he looked back at Eddie, Will was no longer next to him. He had wandered off, seemingly to help break up the argument between Dustin and Max, which was still raging.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cSorry for checking out,\u201d Steve said to Eddie. \u201cI never got into that stuff. Dustin tried to get me to play, but I didn\u2019t really get it. Too many dice.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Eddie laughed. \u201cNo problem, Harrington. Your services were not needed for that particular conversation.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI figured,\u201d Steve said. \u201cSo, you didn\u2019t tell him?\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNo. Not yet.\u201d He paused, playing with his hair absently. \u201cI mean, I dropped a pretty strong hint.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHe didn\u2019t pick it up,\u201d Steve said. His silent exchange with Will had told him that. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you try again?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI will,\u201d Eddie said. \u201cBut he doesn\u2019t know me that well. I still need to build some groundwork there. Let him know he can trust me.\u201d He paused. \u201cAlso the kid has some absolutely bogus opinions on D&amp;D. I had to set him straight.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Steve laughed into his beer can. Set him </span>\n<em>\n<span>straight.</span>\n</em>\n<span> \u201cNot sure you can do that.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Eddie looked at him incredulously. \u201cHarrington, you\u2019re drunk. </span>\n<em>\n<span>And </span>\n</em>\n<span>immature.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThe first part is your fault.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAnd the second?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Steve shrugged. \u201cBad parenting? The public school system?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOkay, well, I had both of those, and I\u2019m neither, so\u2026\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Steve spent pretty much the rest of the party talking to Eddie. He was a little surprised how much fun they had together, even without Robin as their social buffer. Eddie was easy to talk to, and Steve didn\u2019t think it was just because of the alcohol loosening his tongue.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Robin\u2019s date with Vickie seemed to have gone well, because when Steve explained that he couldn\u2019t drive her and that they\u2019d have to ride with Eddie, Vickie jumped at the chance.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOh, I can drive you home, Robin!\u201d She seemed so excited about it. Steve was sure that she must like Robin too.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cSounds good,\u201d Steve said. He shot finger guns at Robin. \u201cSee you tomorrow.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou won\u2019t, actually. Neither of us is working tomorrow. But goodnight, Steve.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Everyone else was saying their goodbyes, but Steve felt a little unsteady on his feet, so he sat down. To his surprise, Argyle\u2019s girlfriend came over to say goodbye to him. He hadn\u2019t even caught her name. She seemed nice, though.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>After a few minutes, Eddie came to retrieve him.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cLet\u2019s get you home, Harrington.\u201d Eddie grabbed the back of Steve\u2019s shirt collar and hauled him to a standing position.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Steve felt a weird swooping sensation in his stomach as he was lifted to his feet. It must have been the alcohol, although that wasn\u2019t a symptom of being drunk that he remembered ever having before. \u201cI can drive,\u201d he said, even though he knew he couldn\u2019t, and had already said he wouldn\u2019t.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNah,\u201d Eddie said. \u201cYou can\u2019t. I\u2019m taking you home. Come on, kids, you too.\u201d He clapped twice and Dustin, Lucas, and Max stood up and started walking over. \u201cYou too, Wheeler.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI can stay here,\u201d Mike said.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Eddie put his hands on his hips, tilted his head, and shot Mike the most skeptical expression Steve had ever seen.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIn Will\u2019s room,\u201d Mike added quickly.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Will looked around wildly, his arms half raised with palms up. This was clearly the first he had heard of this.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYeah, and how long were you planning to </span>\n<em>\n<span>stay </span>\n</em>\n<span>in Will\u2019s room?\u201d Eddie asked. \u201cCome on Wheeler, I had enough trouble with the law this year. I don\u2019t need your girlfriend\u2019s cop dad on my ass for letting this happen.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cArgyle\u2019s already staying in my room,\u201d Will chimed in.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhy doesn\u2019t Argyle stay in Jonathan\u2019s room?\u201d Steve wasn\u2019t sure why that came out of his mouth. It wasn\u2019t like he wanted to facilitate this. Eddie was completely right. Steve looked over at Jonathan, who was looking at Nancy. \u201cOh.\u201d Why did that make his heart drop? Steve was over Nancy. He was pretty sure that he was over Nancy, at least, but it still hurt for some reason.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Steve glanced over at Eddie and was surprised when their eyes met. Eddie held his gaze for a moment, then clapped again, looking back at Mike.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cSounds like that plan is shot, Wheeler.\u201d Eddie tilted his head toward the door. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Mike shot a betrayed look at Will, who was pointedly looking away, and then joined the rest of them.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Steve waved a quick goodbye at those who were staying\u2014 Jonathan, Will, El, Argyle and, apparently, Nancy. They piled into Eddie\u2019s car. Steve took the passenger seat, with the kids in the back. Mike mostly moped while the rest of them chatted. Eddie dropped the kids off one by one, and then only Steve was left.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou okay, Harrington?\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Steve was leaning against the window. The cool glass felt good against his head, which had started to throb. He had passed the fun part of being drunk and was starting to feel like shit. The Nancy and Jonathan thing hadn\u2019t helped.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cSteve?\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Steve hadn\u2019t felt like answering before, but that was the first time tonight that Eddie had used his first name. \u201cYeah, I\u2019m good,\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou sure?\u201d Eddie asked. \u201cYou got real quiet all the sudden.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cMy head hurts.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIs that all?\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Steve sighed. It annoyed him how perceptive Eddie was. It had annoyed him back when they were in the Upside Down and Eddie was giving him speeches about how he and Nancy should be together. And it annoyed him now, when he could clearly see that Steve was feeling weird about seeing her with Jonathan.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI don\u2019t know, man,\u201d Steve said. \u201cI\u2019m over her. But something just\u2013 Have you ever been in love?\u201d Steve couldn\u2019t seem to control the words coming out of his mouth. He felt dizzy.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Eddie paused for a long moment. Steve looked over at him as best he could without actually moving his head. He didn\u2019t want to risk making himself more dizzy. The last thing he needed tonight was to throw up. He could see out of the corner of his eye that Eddie was staring straight ahead, his expression blank.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNope.\u201d Eddie shook his head.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWell, you know how when you love someone\u2013 Wait, you just said\u2013 Sorry.\u201d Steve hadn\u2019t quite processed Eddie\u2019s answer yet. \u201cShe\u2019s the first person I ever fell in love with. The </span>\n<em>\n<span>only </span>\n</em>\n<span>person I ever fell in love with. I don\u2019t want to be with her anymore, but\u2026\u201d He trailed off, shrugging.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAre you sure you don\u2019t want to?\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYeah.\u201d Steve realized he actually was. He could truthfully say to himself that he was no longer in love with Nancy, no longer wanted to be with her. \u201cI\u2019m sure. It\u2019s just weird seeing her with someone else. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m gonna find someone else.\u201d There it was. That was the anxiety he had been feeling about seeing Nancy and Jonathan together. He hadn\u2019t found someone for himself. And he was afraid he never would.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOf course you will,\u201d Eddie said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got no shortage of options, Harrington. The women are lining up to get a date with you.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIt\u2019s not working.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cCan\u2019t get it up?\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Steve whipped his head around to look at Eddie, and the nausea made him immediately regret it. \u201cThat\u2019s not what I\u2019m talking about. This,\u201d Steve said, gesturing vaguely toward his crotch. \u201cWorks fine.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cGood to know. So what\u2019s the problem, then?\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Steve shrugged. \u201cI don\u2019t know. Nobody\u2019s\u2026right.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou\u2019ll find a connection.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cA connection!\u201d Steve raised a finger. \u201cThat\u2019s it. You know what I mean.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYeah, I do,\u201d Eddie said. \u201cOkay, we\u2019re here.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHuh?\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Eddie got out of the car and came around to Steve, opening the passenger side door for him. Eddie pulled Steve up by his arm. \u201cCome on, Harrington.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Steve probably could have walked on his own, but he didn\u2019t mind the support. Steve leaned on Eddie and they walked to the front door together. It took Steve a few tries to get his key in the lock, but he got the door open.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWell.\u201d Steve looked at Eddie.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou need me to take you to bed?\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Did Eddie hear how suggestive that sounded? His tone had been completely neutral, so probably not. Steve didn\u2019t really need that much help walking, but for some reason he agreed. \u201cSure,\u201d he heard himself say.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Eddie wrapped an arm around Steve and walked them through the door together. \u201cWhere\u2019s your bedroom?\u201d he whispered in Steve\u2019s ear.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cUm.\u201d Steve swallowed hard. It wasn\u2019t the first time he had arrived at his front door in the arms of someone who was whispering in his ear, asking where his bedroom was. It was different, obviously. Eddie wasn\u2019t asking for the same reason as the others. But for a moment, it made him pause.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Eddie stared, his face still close to Steve\u2019s. \u201cSteve,\u201d he whispered. \u201cWhich way?\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Steve pointed, and the two of them started in that direction. They made it to Steve\u2019s room, and Eddie opened the door, pulling Steve inside. He directed him toward the bed, then turned him around, dropping him so that he ended up laying on his back on the bed.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAlright, Harrington,\u201d Eddie said, his voice still soft. \u201cGoodnight.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWait, Eddie,\u201d Steve said. \u201cC\u2019mere.\u201d He beckoned him closer.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cShhh,\u201d Eddie said. \u201cYou\u2019re very loud. Your parents are going to wake up.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cJust come here,\u201d Steve said, more quietly.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Eddie leaned over Steve. \u201cWhat? What do you need?\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Steve looked up at Eddie, staring into his eyes. \u201cHow come we don\u2019t hang out more?\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Eddie laughed. \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cLike, just you and me. Hanging out. It would be fun.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Eddie smiled. \u201cSounds good.\u201d He stood up straight. \u201cSee you later, Harrington.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNight,\u201d Steve said.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Eddie walked toward Steve\u2019s bedroom door, and then turned around and came back. He grabbed Steve and pulled him up onto his side. Then he grabbed the trash can from under Steve\u2019s desk and put it next to the bed.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIn case you yak.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThanks.\u201d Steve didn\u2019t think he was going to throw up, but he appreciated the thought.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Eddie stood in the doorway for a moment, looking at Steve, then he left.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The next morning, Steve was woken by a knock on the door. Opening his eyes was painful, so he closed them again, assuming one of his parents would get it. After a few minutes, the knock came again.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Okay, apparently his parents weren\u2019t getting it. He dragged himself out of bed, head pounding. He had fallen asleep in his clothes from the previous night, but had at least managed to kick off his shoes at some point. He ran a hand through his hair, but assumed it was a lost cause.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>He made his way through the house to the front door, which he opened to find Eddie Munson.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cRise and shine, Harrington,\u201d Eddie said, grinning.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cEddie?\u201d Steve squinted at him. \u201cWhat time is it?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Eddie checked his watch. \u201c11:45. I thought you might want to join the land of the living. Want to get breakfast?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>That explained why Steve\u2019s parents didn\u2019t answer the door. They weren\u2019t home. They had already gone to work. It didn\u2019t explain why Eddie was here, though.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cBreakfast?\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYeah, it\u2019s the meal you eat when you first wake up? Is that ringing a bell?\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhy are you here?\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Eddie spread his arms wide. \u201cHey, you said you wanted to hang out more. And what better cure for a hangover than breakfast with your good friend Eddie?\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Eddie looked so earnest. Steve couldn\u2019t say no.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAlright,\u201d he said after some consideration. \u201cGive me five minutes.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>It was more like ten, by the time Steve had changed, brushed his teeth, washed his face, and done his hair. He really wanted a shower, but he didn\u2019t want to make Eddie wait any longer.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAlright,\u201d Steve said. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>They got into Eddie\u2019s car and pulled out of the driveway.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHow\u2019s your head?\u201d Eddie asked.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Steve mentally workshopped a joke response, but he was too hungover to get all the way there. \u201cNot great,\u201d he admitted.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThere\u2019s aspirin in the glove box.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Steve opened the glove compartment, half expecting to find a full pharmacy of illicit drugs, but there was just one innocent little bottle of aspirin. He took two and swallowed them dry.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHow\u2019s\u2026the rest?\u201d Eddie asked when he was done.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThe rest of what?\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou seemed pretty upset last night. Just wanted to know if you\u2019re okay.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Was that why Eddie had turned up on his doorstep? To check on him? That was\u2026really nice, actually.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYeah, I\u2019m fine,\u201d Steve said. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about me.\u201d He </span>\n<em>\n<span>was </span>\n</em>\n<span>fine, right at this moment, because he wasn\u2019t thinking about it. Steve had gotten really good at compartmentalizing. Or repressing, if he </span>\n<em>\n<span>really </span>\n</em>\n<span>didn\u2019t want to think about it. It was a fine technique, probably. It worked for him, pretty much.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Eddie glanced over at him, seemingly unconvinced. \u201cAlright,\u201d he said.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>They pulled up to a diner then, an old-fashioned place that Steve had been a handful of times before. The conversation paused as they were seated, consulted menus, and ordered. Despite the fact that it was now a little after noon, they both ordered breakfast.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cSo,\u201d Eddie said while they waited for their food. \u201cLet\u2019s talk about this Nancy situation.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIt\u2019s not a Nancy situation,\u201d Steve said. \u201cThere\u2019s no Nancy situation.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIt really seemed like there was a Nancy situation, especially over spring break.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYeah, you mentioned that at the time.\u201d Steve had definitely felt something then, and maybe Nancy had too. It was like an echo of their relationship. Nancy was missing Jonathan, and Steve was having no success in finding a girl he could really connect with. He had been longing for that connection, and Nancy was the closest thing he could find at the time. But it wasn\u2019t real.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI honestly thought you two would be getting back together. The </span>\n<em>\n<span>chemistry</span>\n</em>\n<span>\u2013\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWell, obviously we\u2019re not,\u201d Steve snapped.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhoa, okay.\u201d Eddie put his hands up. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, that\u2019s clearly a sore spot.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNo,\u201d Steve said. \u201cIt\u2019s fine. It\u2019s not like that. I care about her. Love her, even. But not the way I used to.\u201d The thought of getting back together with Nancy didn\u2019t feel right. They weren\u2019t kids anymore. They had been through so much, and they had changed enough that they didn\u2019t work together in that way anymore. And Steve knew that Nancy blamed them being together for Barb\u2019s death. That would never stop hanging over either of their heads.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Eddie nodded slowly. \u201cSo\u2026what was all that during Spring Break? All the\u2026glances and stuff.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Steve sighed. \u201cWe were just- We were both lonely, and remembering what we used to have. But we were different people back then. It\u2019s not there anymore.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Eddie nodded. \u201cSo you don\u2019t think the people you are now would be good together?\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNo.\u201d Steve hadn\u2019t thought about it this deeply until Eddie had brought it up, but now he was sure. \u201cDefinitely not. Why do you want us to get together so badly? She has a boyfriend.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Their food arrived then, and the conversation paused as they began eating.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAlright, Harrington,\u201d Eddie said with a shrug. \u201cI believe you. I\u2019ll stop pushing it.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Finally. They could talk about something else. \u201cSo, are you dating anyone?\u201d Steve found himself saying.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Eddie cocked his head and gave Steve a look\u2014eyebrows raised, lips pursed.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhat? Why is that such a crazy thing to ask?\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThere\u2019s not really anyone who\u2019s my type here in Hawkins. Or at least not anyone who would also consider me to be their type.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIf there\u2019s no one, what\u2019s all the bandana stuff for?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWell, it\u2019s not for </span>\n<em>\n<span>dating.</span>\n</em>\n<span>\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Steve wasn\u2019t stupid. He had gotten the rundown on the hanky code from Robin. He had read the back of the box for </span>\n<em>\n<span>Cruising,</span>\n</em>\n<span> though he couldn\u2019t get up the nerve to actually rent it. He knew that Eddie was talking about casual sex, probably with guys he had just met. But that didn\u2019t mean there was no chance he could make a connection with someone.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou could meet someone,\u201d Steve said.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIt\u2019s really not like that, Steve.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOkay.\u201d Steve put up his hands, just like Eddie had a moment ago. \u201cNo relationship talk about either of us, then.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Neither of them said anything for a minute. Steve ran through Eddie\u2019s interests in his mind. D&amp;D, fantasy novels, music that Steve had never heard of. Except, actually-</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI heard a song by that band you were talking about. Black Sabbath?\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Eddie\u2019s face lit up. \u201cYeah? Which one?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cUh,\u201d Steve began. He had to think about that for a second. Because he hadn\u2019t really just heard a song. He had bought the tape. He had seen the tape at the store, recognized the name of the band, and bought it. He didn\u2019t know why, and had almost backed out when the music store employee gave him a weird look. Apparently Steve, in his polo shirt and Members Only jacket, didn\u2019t look like the kind of guy who listened to Black Sabbath. \u201cHeaven and Hell,\u201d he finally said.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOh,\u201d Eddie said. \u201cOzzy\u2019s not on that one. The guy who did the bat thing?\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Well, now Steve felt stupid. That had been the whole reason he bought the tape, because Eddie had compared him to that guy. Or, no- there was no reason actually, because that would be a really weird reason. He just bought it on a whim. It was fine.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThat\u2019s from when Ronnie James Dio was in the band,\u201d Eddie continued, clearly oblivious to Steve\u2019s internal monologue, which Steve was glad about. \u201cAnd\u2014\u201c Eddie twisted in his seat, indicating a large patch on the back of his vest\u2014the vest that Steve had borrowed. It said \u201cDIO\u201d in large gothic letters. \u201cI\u2019m a big fan of his current band. If you liked Heaven and Hell, you should listen to some Dio. And some classic Sabbath, get the Ozzy experience.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Steve wasn\u2019t sure yet if he had liked it. It was a lot. It was very different from what Steve usually listened to, and it had made his dad yell at him, which was more of a point in its favor than anything. But there was something about it he liked. Maybe that it reminded him of Eddie. Or maybe not, because there was something uncomfortable about that thought.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYeah, maybe,\u201d Steve said.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou could come over sometime,\u201d Eddie said. \u201cI could play them for you.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOkay.\u201d Steve nodded. \u201cSure.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The conversation moved on and kept going, from the music Steve listened to (whatever was on the radio, mostly,) to the books they read (Eddie: Tolkien, Zelazny, Moorcock, and a bunch of other authors Steve had never heard of and wouldn\u2019t remember the names of. Steve: not much since high school English class,) to the kids they had both somehow taken under their wing. That was a topic where they had a lot in common. They both cared about those kids a lot, and they both were especially close with Dustin. Steve was glad he wasn\u2019t the only one who had found himself becoming a babysitter. Despite the fact that they didn\u2019t have much in common on the surface, they kept finding things to talk about.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>So that was how they ended up making plans for later in the week. Steve went over to Eddie\u2019s place, listened to metal music, actually enjoyed some of it, and was also surprised by how homoerotic some of it was. Steve wasn\u2019t great at knowing when something was gay, but even he could tell that the cover of Accept\u2019s album </span>\n<em>\n<span>Balls to the Wall </span>\n</em>\n<span>was pretty gay. Steve wondered if all metal music was kinda gay, or just the stuff Eddie listened to.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Steve and Eddie kept hanging out. It was a little weird, maybe. Their other friends definitely thought it was weird at first. But it was nice. Sure, Steve had a stray maybe-sorta-gay thought every once in a while, or found himself staring at Eddie\u2019s lips for a little too long, but he ignored that. He was just happy that they were friends. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Steve was really enjoying hanging out with Eddie. He was so different from anyone else Steve knew. He was charismatic, but also a dork. He was intense, but also funny. He was really nice, but there was also something that seemed dangerous about him.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Maybe it was the drugs. Steve knew that Eddie sold weed, maybe other stuff too, but Eddie never brought it up. Most guys Steve had known who smoked weed regularly couldn\u2019t talk about anything else. Maybe Eddie didn\u2019t actually smoke it, just sell it. But when Steve got up the nerve to ask Eddie whether he ever got high on his own supply, he had just laughed, and invited Steve over to find out. So he went over to Eddie\u2019s one evening after his uncle had left for a night shift.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Steve was no stranger to weed, but Eddie\u2019s tolerance level was off the charts. As Steve tried to keep up with him, he quickly found himself more stoned than he ever had been. He thought it rivaled the Russian truth serum, but it was overall a better experience since no one was punching him in the face and he wasn\u2019t wearing his stupid Scoops Ahoy uniform.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Eddie was not as affected as Steve, but he still seemed like he was having a good time, and after a while he posed a question.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cDo you want to watch a fucked up movie?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Steve raised his eyebrows. \u201cWhat, like a porno?\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNo, it\u2019s not a porno. I mean, it\u2019s X-rated, but\u2014\u201c</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Steve interrupted him. \u201cIs there sex in it?\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYeah, but it\u2019s not sexy. At all.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWait, like a movie sex scene or like actual sex?\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIt\u2019s real, but again, it\u2019s not sexy. It\u2019s mostly just gross.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Steve tilted his head. \u201cReal sex in a movie that isn\u2019t a porno?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Eddie looked at Steve seriously. \u201cSteve, you\u2019re really caught up on the sex part. I need you to understand that this movie is gross. The sex that\u2019s in it is gross.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIf it\u2019s gross, why do you want to watch it?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIt\u2019s good! It\u2019s political, it\u2019s a statement about degeneracy and society and shit.\u201d Eddie threw up his hands. \u201cIt\u2019s counterculture!\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOkay, fine, I\u2019ll watch it!\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Gross turned out to be a massive understatement, but Steve found himself unable to look away from the parade of filth in front of him. Indecent exposure, forced pregnancy, incest, arson, murder, cannibalism, and some truly shocking feats of the human body that Steve had never imagined possible. And yes, sex, but Eddie had been right. It was not remotely sexy.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The movie ended and Steve stared at the blank screen. \u201cWait,\u201d he said after a moment. \u201cIs she a dude?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Eddie looked at Steve in disbelief. \u201cYou are so fucking stupid, Harrington.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Steve stared at Eddie. He couldn\u2019t think of anything to say. The weed had slowed him down enough that he couldn\u2019t keep up with their usual banter.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYes, she\u2019s a dude. She\u2019s a drag queen so, yeah, in her day to day life she\u2019s a dude. Is that seriously all you got out of this?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNooo,\u201d Steve said. But he did get stuck on that for a second. If she was a dude, then this movie contained some seriously gay content. He was grossed out by it, but not because it was gay. As Eddie had warned him, the sex in this movie was very gross. But he thought it was kind of crazy that something like that could be in a movie. \u201cI liked the part where they ate the cops,\u201d he added.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Eddie laughed. \u201cAlright, alright. If that was your favorite part then I guess you kinda get it.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYeah, totally,\u201d Steve said. He didn\u2019t really know what Eddie meant, but he was glad that Eddie thought he did. \u201cI didn\u2019t even know you could put shit like that in a movie.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIt isn\u2019t like some Hollywood movie,\u201d Eddie explained. \u201cWhen this came out, it was some underground shit. It was written, directed, produced, filmed, and edited by one guy. And narrated.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThat\u2019s cool. Who is he?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cJohn Waters. He\u2019s this amazingly creative gay artist who\u2019s just out there, being gay and making fucked-up shit, and he\u2019s famous for it.\u201d Eddie clearly admired the guy, and Steve could see why.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIt\u2019s cool how he\u2019s able to be like\u2026out in the open and everything,\u201d Steve said.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Eddie smiled. \u201cIt\u2019s cool that you think it\u2019s cool.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI mean, most straight guys wouldn\u2019t even enjoy a John Waters movie, let alone think it was cool for people to be openly gay.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI don\u2019t know if I would say I enjoyed it. It was pretty disgusting.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYeah, but that\u2019s the point!\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOkay, then I guess I loved it.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Eddie laughed. \u201cYou\u2019re alright, Harrington.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>They sat in silence for a while. Steve thought about what Eddie had said, about straight guys. Was Steve straight? He\u2019d had some thoughts, back in high school, thoughts that made him panic at the thought that he might be gay, but he always calmed down when he thought about how much he liked girls. If he liked girls, he couldn\u2019t be gay, right? He assumed that all straight guys appreciated the male form from time to time. He\u2019d never felt the same way about a specific guy as he had about specific girls. Right?\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou\u2019re quiet tonight,\u201d Eddie said, interrupting Steve\u2019s train of thought.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI\u2019m very stoned,\u201d Steve admitted.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have tried to keep up with me.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou know I can\u2019t say no to a challenge.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI explicitly said it </span>\n<em>\n<span>wasn\u2019t</span>\n</em>\n<span> a challenge.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYeah, but you always say that.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Eddie laughed, and then fell silent, letting Steve sink into his thoughts again.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>He thought about the night at the Byers\u2019 party, when Robin confronted him about flirting with Eddie. He </span>\n<em>\n<span>had </span>\n</em>\n<span>been flirting. Why? Because he was drunk? But no, he wasn\u2019t even drunk yet when Robin said that. He had been flirting with Eddie entirely of his own accord. Was he attracted to Eddie? The feeling he\u2019d had, when Eddie had said that thing at the video store\u2026</span>\n<em>\n<span>it means you like to be tied up. </span>\n</em>\n<span>Steve had pushed that one down extra hard. It took a lot of effort to stop thinking about that. The feeling in his stomach when Eddie had leaned over him like that. Yes, okay, Steve was attracted to Eddie. And maybe he was curious about bondage now, too. He didn\u2019t know what to do with either of those facts.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhat are you thinking about?\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Steve said, not looking at Eddie. \u201cWhen did you know you were gay?\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOh.\u201d The tone of surprise told Steve that Eddie had not been expecting that question. \u201cI guess I kind of always knew. Ever since I was a little kid.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIs it like that for everyone?\u201d Steve definitely hadn\u2019t always known about whatever this was. Whatever these feelings meant about him.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNo,\u201d Eddie said slowly. \u201cI think I realized pretty early. Some people might figure it out around puberty, you know, when they start thinking about sex. Some guys don\u2019t know until they\u2019ve been married for thirty years and finally realize why they\u2019re not attracted to their wives. Everyone\u2019s different.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Steve didn\u2019t know what to say. Was that reassuring, or worrying?\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhen did you know you were straight?\u201d Eddie asked with a mocking smile.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Steve turned toward Eddie quickly, alarmed. He had no idea what kind of face he was making, but as soon as Eddie saw it, the smile dropped from his face.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cShit, Steve,\u201d he said. \u201cI was just kidding. I shouldn\u2019t have\u2013 What\u2019s up?\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI\u2019m not sure,\u201d Steve said. \u201cI like girls. I </span>\n<em>\n<span>love</span>\n</em>\n<span> girls. But I\u2019ve had\u2026thoughts.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThoughts about guys?\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Eddie looked so serious that Steve was almost afraid to look at him. He nodded.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAnd\u2026other stuff,\u201d Steve said.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhat kind of other stuff?\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou remember that day in Family Video? When you told me what the bandana meant? I don\u2019t know\u2013 It\u2019s stupid.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Eddie shook his head. \u201cIt\u2019s not stupid. But you know bondage isn\u2019t inherently a gay thing. You could ask a girl to tie you up.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2026want it to be a girl.\u201d Steve had considered it, and it didn\u2019t interest him. He could only picture it happening with a guy. Mostly one specific guy. \u201cIs that weird?\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNo.\u201d Eddie shook his head. \u201cYou can like both. And like different stuff with guys than with girls. That\u2019s\u2026lots of guys are like that.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cReally?\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYeah, bisexuality is a thing, Harrington.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI kind of thought David Bowie made that up.\u201d Was Steve bisexual? He didn\u2019t feel like he was ready to decide that.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Eddie laughed. \u201cNo, definitely not.\u201d He looked serious again, his face close to Steve\u2019s. \u201cDo you want me to tell you how to meet guys?\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhat, so I can just ask some random guy I just met to tie me up?\u201d The thought made Steve feel a little sick. \u201cAnd\u2026whatever else?\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Eddie shrugged. \u201cI mean, that\u2019s kind of how I do it. Except, you know, the opposite.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Steve didn\u2019t ask what Eddie meant by that, but he could infer. Eddie liked to do the tying. Knowing that was scary, because it made the thoughts Steve had seem a little closer to being real. Like they could, maybe, actually become real.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNo,\u201d Steve said. \u201cI can\u2019t. Not with a stranger.\u201d That would take a lot of trust. Steve wasn\u2019t going to put that responsibility in the hands of someone he\u2019d never met before. And what else would that hypothetical guy expect of Steve? He didn\u2019t even know if he would like all of that. \u201cI\u2019ve never even kissed a guy.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cDo you want to?\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Steve\u2019s heart skipped a beat. He searched Eddie\u2019s face. Was he asking in the abstract, or specifically, right now? Their faces were already so close together, but Eddie was a close talker. It had annoyed Steve since the moment they met. But it didn\u2019t annoy him now. Steve couldn\u2019t help staring at Eddie\u2019s mouth. His lips looked full, soft. Steve really wanted to kiss them. To kiss Eddie.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Steve licked his lips. Not in an alluring way, just, his mouth was so dry. From the weed, or the nerves, or maybe both. \u201cYeah,\u201d he said.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Eddie leaned in, slowly closing the gap between them, and Steve followed. Their lips met slowly, and Steve thought Eddie seemed oddly hesitant for someone who had just been talking about picking up strangers for kinky sex.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>But Steve was hesitant, too. How was he supposed to kiss a guy? Was it the same as kissing a girl? He could feel the roughness of stubble against his face, which was new, but he didn\u2019t mind. He put his hand up to touch Eddie\u2019s face, still uncertain. Eddie followed his lead, slipping his hand around the back of Steve\u2019s head, threading his fingers through his hair and pulling him closer.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Yes, okay. Steve liked this. He was into this. He let his other hand wander a bit, feeling the hard muscle of Eddie\u2019s shoulder and arm. Eddie felt different from anyone he had ever kissed, but it felt right. Like Steve had been missing something all these years by </span>\n<em>\n<span>not</span>\n</em>\n<span> kissing guys. He put his arms around Eddie, wanting to be closer. Eddie held Steve tightly, one hand in his hair and one on his back. He was strong. Steve liked that. He liked the way Eddie set the pace, leading him, guiding him. Even though Eddie was gentle, he was in control. No one had ever kissed Steve like that before.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWait, wait,\u201d Eddie said, his face still close to Steve\u2019s, eyes still closed. \u201cWe have to stop.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhat? Why?\u201d Steve thought Eddie had been enjoying himself.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou\u2019re stoned as </span>\n<em>\n<span>fuck</span>\n</em>\n<span>.\u201d Eddie pulled away from Steve and sat straight on the couch, elbows resting on his knees and hands on either side of his face.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cSo?\u201d Steve didn\u2019t understand what was going on.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cSo I shouldn\u2019t have kissed you.\u201d Eddie sounded guilty.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI wanted you to.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYeah, but would you have wanted me to if you were sober?\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYeah,\u201d Steve said. He was still staring at Eddie\u2019s lips. If he was being honest with himself, he had wanted Eddie to kiss him for a very long time.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOkay.\u201d Eddie didn\u2019t sound convinced. \u201cOkay, but we still have to stop. That- that\u2019s it.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhat if I don\u2019t want that to be it?\u201d Steve didn\u2019t want to pressure Eddie, but it had felt like he was just as into it as Steve was.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Eddie stared at Steve for a long moment. \u201cIf you still want it when you\u2019re sober, then\u2026\u201d He put his hands out, indicating his surroundings. \u201cYou know where to find me.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Steve nodded. He was pretty sure he was still going to want it. He was pretty sure he had wanted it for a long time. He just wasn\u2019t sure exactly </span>\n<em>\n<span>what</span>\n</em>\n<span> he wanted with Eddie. But it seemed like he would have some time to think about it.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Eddie stood. \u201cI have to go to bed,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can crash on the couch if you want. You probably shouldn\u2019t drive.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYeah, okay.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Steve watched Eddie disappear into his bedroom, still a little bit in shock. So many things had happened tonight. He had smoked probably more weed than he ever had in his life, combined, had admitted his feelings about guys, kissed a guy, been rejected\u2013at least temporarily\u2013by that guy. Not to mention watching a drag queen literally eat shit in the weirdest movie he had ever seen. It was a lot to process.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>He wasn\u2019t expecting to fall asleep; there was too much to think about. But he did, drifting off on Eddie\u2019s couch.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Hours later, he heard a door open and saw light streaming in. Where was he? He looked around to see Eddie\u2019s trailer, and the previous night came flooding back to him. But he couldn\u2019t think about that right now, because there was a man walking through the door. Steve scrambled to a seated position and, for some stupid reason, started trying to fix his hair.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWho are you?\u201d The guy asked. Probably Eddie\u2019s uncle, back from the night shift.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cSteve Harrington. I\u2019m a friend of Eddie\u2019s? He said I could crash on the couch.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Eddie\u2019s uncle looked at Steve, then shifted his eyes to Eddie\u2019s bedroom door. Did he suspect something? No, Steve had slept on the couch. That wasn\u2019t suspicious, right? Eddie\u2019s uncle looked back at Steve. \u201cWayne Munson,\u201d he said. \u201cWhere is Eddie?\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Steve said. \u201cIn his room, I guess? Probably still asleep.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Wayne narrowed his eyes at Steve. \u201cOkay, then.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cUh,\u201d Steve said. \u201cI\u2019m gonna\u2026go. I should go.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAlright. See you around, Steve Harrington.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYeah, see you around.\u201d There was something very weird about this conversation, but Steve didn\u2019t know what it was.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Steve went home, showered, and headed to work. It was a pretty normal day, even if he was a little quieter than usual. Robin didn\u2019t seem to notice; she just did all of the talking for both of them.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Steve thought about Eddie. About what had happened that night, and what he might want to happen on future nights. It made sense. Steve was curious. About guys and about bondage. But the thought of hooking up with random guys, especially letting them tie him up, was way too scary.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>So why not do it with someone he trusted? A friend? Why not do it with Eddie? He knew he would be safe with Eddie. Eddie wouldn\u2019t hurt him, despite the fact that he had held a broken bottle to Steve\u2019s neck the first time they met. That was a misunderstanding. And, in retrospect, it was\u2026 kind of hot.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>He would address that thought later. He had already figured out enough things about himself today.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Steve ended up back at Eddie\u2019s trailer after work.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHey,\u201d he said when Eddie answered the door. \u201cCan we, uh, talk?\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYeah,\u201d Eddie said casually. He smiled, clapped Steve on the shoulder. \u201cCome on in, Harrington.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Steve peered around him. \u201cIs your uncle around?\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHe\u2019s still asleep. Why?\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Steve said. \u201cHe kind of freaked me out this morning.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHe\u2019s pretty harmless, Steve.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWell, I didn\u2019t know that! It felt like he might\u2026\u201d Steve lowered his voice just in case Wayne Munson wasn\u2019t actually sleeping, but eavesdropping. \u201c</span>\n<em>\n<span>Suspect something.</span>\n</em>\n<span>\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Eddie laughed. \u201cTrust me, I\u2019ve done way worse in his home and he has never once suspected anything.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThat\u2019s kind of what I wanted to talk about,\u201d Steve said. </span>\n<em>\n<span>I want you to do way worse to me</span>\n</em>\n<span>, he thought. \u201cBut maybe we can go somewhere more private?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cSure,\u201d Eddie said. \u201cLet\u2019s go to my room.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Eddie sat on his bed. Steve thought about sitting next to him, but decided a chair was a safer bet.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Eddie said once they were settled. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have done that. Kissed you. Are we cool? Because\u2014\u201c</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYeah,\u201d Steve said. \u201cOf course we\u2019re cool. And you don\u2019t have to apologize because I definitely wanted to kiss you.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cCool,\u201d Eddie said in a measured tone. \u201cSo, uh, what does that mean?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I\u2019m still kind of figuring that out. I don\u2019t know if I like guys.\u201d That wasn\u2019t entirely true. He knew he liked kissing Eddie. \u201cI mean, I don\u2019t know </span>\n<em>\n<span>how much </span>\n</em>\n<span>I like guys, I guess. I\u2019ve thought about, you know, doing stuff with guys.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou mean sex?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Steve tilted his head from side to side, considering. \u201cMaybe,\u201d he admitted. \u201cI\u2019m not sure. I wouldn\u2019t feel comfortable picking up strangers or anything, though. It would have to be someone I trust.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Eddie raised his eyebrows, smirking. \u201cLike your good friend Eddie.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Steve stood up. \u201cYou know what, this was a stupid idea. I\u2019m sorry, I\u2014\u201c</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWait, no. Steve.\u201d Eddie stood and held up his hands. \u201cThat\u2019s not what I\u2019m saying. Look, I\u2019m\u2014\u201c he paused. \u201cVery much in favor of the idea, actually.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cReally?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYeah. You should be able to experiment if you want to, and it would be way safer to do it with a friend than to pick up some random creep down by the quarry or something.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The quarry? That was too specific; did Eddie pick up guys down by the quarry? Steve had to sit down again.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cSo what are we talking, here?\u201d Eddie asked. \u201cYou wanna make out? Fool around?\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYeah, I guess. But also, you know, the other stuff. We talked about.\u201d Steve was too embarrassed to say the word.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Eddie raised his eyebrows again. \u201cBondage?\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIf you\u2019re not into it\u2014\u201c</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOh, I\u2019m into it, Harrington. I would be happy to\u2026\u201d he paused, frowning thoughtfully. Considering something. \u201cShow you the ropes. No, that was terrible. Forget I said that.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>It </span>\n<em>\n<span>was </span>\n</em>\n<span>pretty terrible, but Steve laughed anyway. It diffused some of the tension. Steve felt more at ease now.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAnyway, Harrington, as much as I would love to help you out with this right now, my uncle is going to wake up soon and he has the day off tomorrow. His next night shift is Friday, if you\u2019re interested.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThis Friday?\u201d That was so soon. This was actually happening.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Eddie shrugged. \u201cIf you want.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cUh, yeah. Okay. Should I bring anything?\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Eddie shook his head, shrugging. \u201cLike what?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Steve said. \u201cLike the things you bring when someone\u2019s having you over to their house? Beer? Weed?\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cFirst of all,\u201d Eddie said. \u201cWho are you getting weed from other than me? Rude. I thought we were friends. Second of all, no. If we\u2019re doing this, we\u2019re doing it one hundred percent sober.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhy?\u201d Steve felt like he would need something to calm his nerves, if he was really going to do this.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIf you\u2019re drunk, or stoned, or whatever, you might agree to do something you wouldn\u2019t normally do.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Steve felt like that was sort of the point, but based on Eddie\u2019s reaction to kissing Steve when they were stoned, he didn\u2019t think that would go over well. \u201cOkay,\u201d he said. \u201cTotally sober bondage session between friends. Friday night.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIt\u2019s a date,\u201d Eddie said. \u201cOr, you know, not a date. The thing you said.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Steve felt like he was sleepwalking through the next couple of days. All he could think about was his not-date with Eddie. He was excited, anxious, and confused. On Friday, he was totally checked out at work, and Robin noticed.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cEarth to Steve,\u201d she said. \u201cYou okay?\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYeah.\u201d Steve crossed and uncrossed his arms, feeling restless. \u201cI\u2019m fine. Just tired. I really want to get home and get to bed.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>When Steve did finally get home, he showered, changed, did his hair. All the things he would do for a normal date, or a hookup. That\u2019s what this was, he figured. A hookup. He was hooking up with Eddie Munson.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>He drove to Eddie\u2019s trailer, parked, knocked on the door.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Eddie answered. \u201cWelcome to my humble abode,\u201d he said, gesturing for Steve to go inside.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cSo, your uncle isn\u2019t home?\u201d Steve looked around, as though Wayne Munson might suddenly jump out from around the corner and catch them.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHe\u2019s working the night shift again,\u201d Eddie said. \u201cIt\u2019s just you and me.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>They went into Eddie\u2019s bedroom. Eddie sat on the bed and patted the spot next to him. Steve sat.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cSo\u2026\u201d Eddie started. \u201cWe should probably lay some ground rules. Set some boundaries, expectations, all that.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOh,\u201d Steve said. He had sort of thought they would just get right into it and figure that stuff out as they went along. \u201cI guess, uh, start it out kind of light. Just my hands tied, maybe. Not too serious.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAlright. And if you ever want me to untie you, or to stop for any reason, you can just say stop, or no, or any normal thing you would say. Unless you want that to be part of it.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhat do you mean</span>\n<em>\n<span> part of it</span>\n</em>\n<span>?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cPart of the scene,\u201d Eddie said. Steve hadn\u2019t heard the term </span>\n<em>\n<span>scene </span>\n</em>\n<span>in this context, but considering how theatrical Eddie was in his day to day life, it made sense. \u201cIf you want me to keep going when you say no. If you want to struggle, and for me not to stop. Then we\u2019d need a safe word.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Steve swallowed. He wondered how often Eddie did that. He thought about it for a second, and discovered that, while the thought wasn\u2019t entirely unappealing, it was terrifying. \u201cNo,\u201d he said finally. \u201cStop is fine. Stop if I say stop.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOkay.\u201d Eddie paused. \u201cHow far do you want to go with this?\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Steve\u2019s mouth felt dry. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cCome on, Harrington, use some context clues. Do you want to fuck or what?\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWow, um.\u201d Steve was a little shocked that Eddie just came out and said it. He also wasn\u2019t quite sure how to respond to it. \u201cThat was direct.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWell, I tried being slightly less direct, but you did in fact ask for clarification.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThat\u2019s fair.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou still haven\u2019t actually answered the question.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cMaybe we can just leave our clothes on. You know, this time.\u201d He wasn\u2019t sure if there would be a next time. He wasn\u2019t sure if he would </span>\n<em>\n<span>want</span>\n</em>\n<span> a next time, after they were done. \u201cIs that weird?\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNo. Not weird at all.\u201d Eddie didn\u2019t look disappointed, which Steve was glad about. \u201cWe\u2019ll start slow.\u201d He stood up. \u201cGet on your knees on the bed.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhoa,\u201d Steve\u2019s breath caught in his throat. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t sound like starting slow.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNot like that, dumbass. Just like\u2013\u201d He straightened his back, put his hands behind himself, demonstrating. \u201cLike this, but on your knees. Sitting on your feet.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhy can\u2019t I just sit normally?\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cBecause then you could just get up and walk away,\u201d Eddie said slowly. \u201cI thought you wanted to be restrained.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOh,\u201d Steve said. Right. He got in position as Eddie told him to, taking a deep breath to try to prepare himself.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Eddie got behind Steve, and that was enough to get Steve\u2019s heart beating fast.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhat are you going to use?\u201d Steve asked. \u201cRope, or\u2026?\u201d He trailed off.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNah,\u201d Eddie said. \u201cIt\u2019s your first time. I\u2019m taking it easy on you.\u201d He waved the black bandana in front of Steve\u2019s face.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cCome on,\u201d Steve was skeptical. \u201cThere\u2019s no way that\u2019s gonna hold me. It\u2019ll slip right off.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Eddie grabbed Steve\u2019s wrists and leaned forward over his shoulder, his lips almost touching Steve\u2019s ear. \u201cNow, </span>\n<em>\n<span>that</span>\n</em>\n<span> sounds like a challenge.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Steve let out a shaky breath. He couldn\u2019t believe how turned on he was already. He was definitely not straight. \u201cYeah, I guess it is, Munson.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Steve felt Eddie start tying knots around his wrists, but he must have been doing it without looking, because his head was still next to Steve\u2019s.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cMaybe this is a good time to tell you what the black bandana means,\u201d Eddie said. \u201cIt\u2019s S&amp;M. And I wear it on the </span>\n<em>\n<span>left</span>\n</em>\n<span> side.\u201d He emphasized that by pulling the knots a little too tight, tight enough to hurt, for just a moment before loosening them.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Steve let out a small whimper. He had never heard himself make that noise before. He was torn between feeling horribly embarrassed and thrilled that this was actually happening.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou know what that means, Harrington?\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOf course I know what that means,\u201d Steve said. \u201cI said I wasn\u2019t gay, not that I was celibate.\u201d Even if he wasn\u2019t into that sort of thing, or hadn\u2019t been until recently, he knew what S&amp;M meant. Sadism and Masochism. People who liked to get hurt during sex, and people who liked to do the hurting. And he could infer that if his gray bandana on the right meant he wanted to be tied up, Eddie\u2019s on the left meant that he was the one doing the tying. And the hurting.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cReally? Because this feels kind of gay to me.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYeah, okay.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI don\u2019t normally tie guys up for straight reasons.\u201d He finished tying and dropped Steve\u2019s wrists, standing up. Steve was a little disappointed. It had felt really good to have Eddie behind him, holding his wrists, whispering in his ear.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cTry it,\u201d Eddie said. \u201cTry to slip out.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Steve moved his wrists, struggling against the bandana tied around his wrists, but he couldn\u2019t get out. It was like handcuffs. Like the handcuffs Steve had just noticed hanging on Eddie\u2019s wall. Right out in the open. He wondered if those were on the table, but thought it might be too much. His heart was already beating so fast that he felt like it might explode.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOkay,\u201d Steve said. \u201cI admit it. You\u2019re good.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cSo, the S&amp;M stuff,\u201d Eddie began.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYeah, I heard you were a dungeon master but I didn\u2019t realize that\u2019s what they meant.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThat\u2019s\u2014 okay, that\u2019s pretty good,\u201d Eddie admitted, grinning.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNever heard that one before?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNo, those parts of my life don\u2019t tend to intersect.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThat makes sense,\u201d Steve said. He didn\u2019t tend to think of guys who played D&amp;D as guys who had a lot of sex. Apparently he was wrong, at least in this one case.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAny way, what I was going to say was\u2014the S&amp;M stuff tends to go hand in hand with the bondage stuff, but if you\u2019re not interested\u2013\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI\u2019m interested,\u201d Steve said. The words came out before he had even processed them. But it was true. He was interested. One of the times that Steve had the shit beat out of him, they must have knocked something loose in his brain, because the thought of Eddie roughing him up actually sounded good. Really good. Once again, he remembered the first time they had met, when Eddie had pinned him up against a wall. He could maybe do without the threat of cutting his throat, but the rest\u2026</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Eddie looked at Steve with a smile that Steve felt like he had seen a few times before. When they had been, Steve admitted to himself, flirting. Eddie smiled like he wanted to eat Steve alive. And as Steve looked up at him, barely able to move, totally vulnerable, he wanted Eddie to do it.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYeah, I can tell you\u2019re interested, Harrington,\u201d Eddie said. He looked Steve up and down, then looked pointedly at his crotch. \u201cI can\u2019t believe you\u2019re hard already. Are you that eager for it? Damn, you must be a natural sub.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Steve\u2019s face got hot. He had never thought of himself as submissive before. He had never had any desire to do anything like that with a girl. And yeah, he was embarrassed that he had gotten hard, especially this fast, but the embarrassment was only making it worse. Eddie looking at him like that and saying those things only turned him on more.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cShut up, Munson,\u201d he mumbled, looking away.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Eddie was on him in a second, straddling him. He put his hand to Steve\u2019s throat and held it firmly, not enough to choke him but enough to pull his face forward so he had to look at Eddie. \u201cWhat makes you think you\u2019re the one giving orders here, Harrington?\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Eddie\u2019s body was firmly against Steve\u2019s. Steve could feel Eddie\u2019s dick pressed up against his own, Eddie\u2019s hand on his throat, the bandana tight against his wrists, and Eddie\u2019s eyes intensely focused on his own. Steve didn\u2019t know what to do with all of that stimulus. He wanted to rub up against Eddie, wanted to kiss him, but he also kind of wanted to run away.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Eddie jumped back suddenly. \u201cShit,\u201d he said. \u201cThat was too much. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d His eyes had lost the intensity. He looked concerned, nervous.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNo,\u201d Steve said. He hadn\u2019t wanted to stop, but he realized now that he was trembling. Maybe it was a little too much, even if he wanted it.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cLet\u2019s\u2013\u201d Eddie ran his hand through his hair, and then moved toward Steve again. \u201cLet\u2019s stop here. Take a break.\u201d He started untying Steve\u2019s wrists.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Steve knew he had ruined it. He wanted it. He wanted it </span>\n<em>\n<span>so badly</span>\n</em>\n<span>. Why had he reacted like that?\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>After untying him, Eddie coaxed Steve into a lying position, on his back. Then Eddie got on the bed next to him, pressing his body against Steve and putting an arm around him.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Steve asked.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAftercare, dipshit.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Steve was not as bad at reading context clues as Eddie thought. He could guess what aftercare was. But this wasn\u2019t really </span>\n<em>\n<span>after </span>\n</em>\n<span>anything. They had barely started when Steve fucked it up.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cDoes aftercare generally involve calling someone a dipshit?\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIf he\u2019s a dipshit, yeah,\u201d Eddie said.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Steve said.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Eddie rubbed Steve\u2019s arm gently. \u201cWhat are you sorry for?\u201d His voice was low in Steve\u2019s ear, but not like it had been earlier. He sounded calm, soothing.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI fucked it up,\u201d Steve said. He had calmed down a little, at least. He wasn\u2019t shaking anymore.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNo,\u201d Eddie said in the same soothing tone. \u201cYou did great. It\u2019s fine.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Steve didn\u2019t respond. He just lay there, comforted by the warmth of Eddie\u2019s body, the light, tender touch of his hands. After a few minutes, he turned his head toward Eddie, who was still looking at him with concern. He couldn\u2019t believe how kind Eddie was being, how he could go from rough to soft so quickly. It made Steve want to kiss him.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>So he did. He leaned forward, pressing his lips against Eddie\u2019s. Eddie didn\u2019t respond at first, maybe out of surprise, but then he brought a hand up to Steve\u2019s face and began kissing him in earnest, parting his lips for Steve\u2019s tongue. They kissed for a while, slowly, and Steve ran his hand down Eddie\u2019s side, pulled him close.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>They sat up, still kissing, and Eddie shrugged off his jacket. Steve thought that seemed like a good idea, so he ran his hands up under Eddie\u2019s t-shirt, pulling it over his head. They undressed each other slowly, gently. They were laying down again, in only their underwear now, pressed together, with Steve\u2019s mouth on Eddie\u2019s throat, when Eddie stopped them.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWait,\u201d he said breathlessly. \u201cWait, are we doing this?\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cDoing what?\u201d Steve asked. He had vague knowledge of what gay sex entailed, but he didn\u2019t know what Eddie had in mind.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI don\u2019t know, Harrington! You tell me, because you\u2019re the one who said you didn\u2019t want to have sex tonight!\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Steve said. \u201cI don\u2019t know, just\u2013 Just touch me, okay?\u201d He needed it. He needed Eddie, or at least wanted him. Just as badly as he had wanted anyone.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOkay,\u201d Eddie said. He pulled Steve close again, kissing his neck as he started rubbing him through his boxers.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Steve pushed up against Eddie\u2019s hand, and Eddie slipped his hand under the elastic of Steve\u2019s boxers and started stroking him slowly. Steve closed his eyes, letting Eddie take control.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Steve didn\u2019t do anything for a bit, just enjoying the feelings of Eddie sucking at his neck as he stroked his cock. When he realized, he felt like he should take some sort of action. He reached out, grabbed Eddie\u2019s hips and pulled him closer. The feeling of his dick pressed against Eddie\u2019s earlier had been so good, and he wanted that now, without the clothes in the way. He pushed against Eddie, and Eddie got the idea.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>In a moment, they were naked and Eddie was stroking both of them with one hand. Steve thrusted against him and moaned into his mouth. They continued like that, getting faster and more erratic, Eddie breathing hard, breaking their kiss to suck on Steve\u2019s neck again. He sucked harder, then bit down. That took Steve over the edge, and he came with a soft cry. Eddie followed soon after, then pulled his hand away, pulled apart from Steve, just far enough to look at him.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Eddie was still panting as he stared at Steve, looking utterly bewildered. Steve figured he looked pretty much the same.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI think I\u2019m bisexual,\u201d Steve blurted out.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYeah, Harrington,\u201d Eddie said, rolling onto his back. \u201cI gathered.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>When Steve left the next morning, Eddie was still passed out. Steve expected him to wake up at some point while he got dressed, but the guy was a deep sleeper.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Steve found a notebook and pen on Eddie\u2019s nightstand. He flipped past a few pages of what looked like lyrics and tore out a blank sheet, on which he quickly scrawled three lines.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<span>Early shift at work. Didn\u2019t want to wake you. Talk soon.\u00a0</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>He considered signing his name, but realized a note like that, signed </span>\n<em>\n<span>Steve</span>\n</em>\n<span>, would raise some eyebrows if anyone ever found it. And besides, who else would Eddie think it was from?\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>He didn\u2019t have time to go home. He left Eddie\u2019s and went straight to Robin\u2019s to pick her up for work.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>She hopped in the passenger seat exactly as she did every day. It was weird to Steve, somehow, for her to act so normal. He felt like something about him must be different, like she had to notice eventually.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAre you wearing the same clothes you were wearing yesterday?\u201d There it was.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYeah.\u201d He didn\u2019t bother denying it. She wouldn\u2019t believe him, and then she\u2019d make it into a whole thing, and it would make it that much harder for him to talk about it. Because he was pretty sure he needed to talk about it.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOkay, gross. What, you had a hot date last night you didn\u2019t tell me about?\u201d She peered over at him. \u201cOh my god, you did! You have a hickey!\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Steve clapped a hand over his neck. He could remember, vividly, where Eddie\u2019s mouth had been.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWho was it?\u201d Robin asked.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cRobin, if I tell you something, do you promise not to freak out?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI\u2019m not gonna freak out. When do I freak out? I don\u2019t freak out.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201c</span>\n<em>\n<span>Robin.\u201d</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<span>\u201c</span>\n</em>\n<span>Okay, okay, I promise.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI kind of\u2026\u201d Steve trailed off. He braced himself for Robin\u2019s freakout. \u201cHooked up with Eddie.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Robin shrieked.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Steve had not braced himself enough. He swerved, narrowly avoiding a car that sped past him, honking.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cRobin, can you not do that while I\u2019m driving?\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNo! Oh my god, no, I can\u2019t not do that because holy shit! What do you mean hooked up? How far did you go with him? Wait, I don\u2019t want to know that, actually. Or, I kind of do, just out of curiosity, because I can\u2019t really picture it\u2013\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cStop trying to picture it!\u201d Steve needed Robin to calm down, or he was going to start panicking too, and he was really proud of how long he had gone without panicking about this.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOh my god, Steve.\u201d Steve glanced over at her. He had never seen her look so shocked, which didn\u2019t bode well since he had seen her infiltrate a secret Russian base and enter an alternate dimension full of monsters. \u201cI knew you were attracted to men,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I didn\u2019t know that </span>\n<em>\n<span>you</span>\n</em>\n<span> knew.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhat do you mean you </span>\n<em>\n<span>knew</span>\n</em>\n<span>?\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI mean, I knew you liked to </span>\n<em>\n<span>look </span>\n</em>\n<span>at them, not that you liked to\u2013\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Steve tuned her out for a moment. How had she noticed? Sure, he looked at guys in movies sometimes, but he figured it just looked like he was paying attention. And he had made a concerted effort to not look at attractive guys who came into the store. Had she noticed him </span>\n<em>\n<span>not</span>\n</em>\n<span> looking?\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cSteve.\u201d Robin was a little quieter now, which Steve felt might be a good first step to being able to actually communicate with her. \u201cHow did that even happen?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d He told Robin a lot, but he wasn\u2019t going to tell her that he had asked Eddie Munson to tie him up. He didn\u2019t want her to scream again. \u201cIt just happened.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOh my god.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYeah, you said that a few times now.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m just surprised.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI got that.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cUm, congratulations on your bisexual awakening, I guess.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThanks.\u201d He had wanted to talk about it, but now he didn\u2019t know what to say. Steve gripped the steering wheel hard and looked straight ahead.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cBe careful, okay?\u201d Robin said after a moment.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI\u2019m not an idiot, Robin,\u201d he said defensively. \u201cAnd it\u2019s not like we even did anything that required\u2026 protection.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOh. </span>\n<em>\n<span>My god. </span>\n</em>\n<span>Okay. Thanks. Much easier to picture now.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cStop picturing!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOkay, okay! I\u2019ll stop.\u201d She paused. \u201cThat\u2019s not actually what I meant by </span>\n<em>\n<span>careful</span>\n</em>\n<span>. Just be careful with him, okay? With Eddie.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhat? He should be careful with me! I\u2019m the one\u2014\u201c he almost finished the sentence with </span>\n<em>\n<span>getting tied up</span>\n</em>\n<span>, but they had arrived at Family Video and he needed Robin to not be catatonic so she could help him open. \u201cWho\u2019s never done this before.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>As they unlocked the doors and got things ready for the morning, Robin seemed deep in thought. It was only after the shop opened and people started coming in and out that she spoke again.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cLook, Steve. I was debating whether to tell you this, but I think I have to. Maybe you already know, but\u2026\u201d she trailed off.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI won\u2019t know if I know until you tell me. Just say it.\u201d He was sorting tapes, only half listening.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhen I said to be careful, earlier.\u201d Steve looked up. \u201cI meant\u2014 the person we were talking about\u2026has kind of a </span>\n<em>\n<span>thing</span>\n</em>\n<span> for you,\u201d she finished.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Steve stared at her. \u201cA </span>\n<em>\n<span>thing</span>\n</em>\n<span>? What kind of thing?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cLike\u2026an attraction thing. Maybe a crush thing.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhat?\u201d Steve looked around the store to see how openly he could talk. There was a group of guys over in the horror movies, and an elderly couple in the romances. So, not openly at all. \u201cDid this person tell you that?\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Robin looked worried. Maybe a little guilty. Was she worried about telling Eddie\u2019s secrets? How did she even know Eddie\u2019s secrets? They must have been hanging out without Steve. He was kind of jealous.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThe first part, yes,\u201d Robin said. \u201cThe second part was more implied.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNo way.\u201d Eddie had been very clear about this being casual, not to mention mainly for Steve\u2019s benefit. He had assumed Eddie was attracted to him, or else it wouldn\u2019t have happened. But a crush?</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Robin rolled her eyes. \u201cGod, Steve, how can you have sex with someone and not realize they have a crush on you?\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cShhhhh,\u201d Steve hissed. But everyone in the video store had stopped what they were doing to look at Robin and Steve.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Steve put one hand on his hip and smiled out at everyone. The patented Steve Harrington move for diffusing tension.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The old couple gave him a disgusted look and went back to looking at movies. The group of guys was shooting glances at Steve and barely stifling their laughter.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNot me,\u201d Robin called over to them. \u201cSomeone else. We\u2019re just friends,\u201d she said, gesturing between herself and Steve.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThanks, Robin, that\u2019s very helpful,\u201d Steve said, smile still plastered on his face.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNo problem, buddy.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Once everyone had stopped looking at them, Steve dropped the smile and lowered his voice. \u201cFor your information,\u201d he whispered to Robin. \u201cEddie and me are </span>\n<em>\n<span>also</span>\n</em>\n<span> just friends.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWith benefits.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYes. Exactly.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Robin raised her eyebrows. \u201cOkay,\u201d she said. She didn\u2019t sound convinced. \u201cAs long as you\u2019re on the same page about that.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWe are,\u201d Steve hissed. \u201cWe discussed it, actually. Everything was made very clear.\u201d It was one of the longer conversations about boundaries and expectations Steve had ever had before having sex with someone. Eddie was thorough. But, Steve realized, he had sort of messed that up by insisting that they weren\u2019t going to have sex and then changing his mind.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Robin exhaled loudly. \u201cFine. That\u2019s good.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Steve didn\u2019t think Eddie had a crush on him. He was sure that Robin had just misunderstood. He wasn\u2019t worried about that. They were just two friends who were attracted to each other, and decided to have sex. Steve was exploring some things, and Eddie was helping him out, as a friend. It was platonic, with a capital P. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Steve was a little nervous about contacting Eddie after that night. They had been spending a lot of time together as friends, but this obviously complicated things. Was it going to happen again? Steve certainly wanted it to, but what if his inexperience had turned Eddie off?\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>When the phone rang a few days after he had hooked up with Eddie, Steve rushed to it.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHey, Steve,\u201d the voice said after he answered.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOh. Hey, Robin.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWow, sorry to disappoint you.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNo, no.\u201d Steve hadn\u2019t meant to let that come through in his voice. \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWho were you hoping would be calling? Your </span>\n<em>\n<span>boyfriend</span>\n</em>\n<span>?\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cRobin, he\u2019s not\u2013\u201d Steve looked around to make sure that his parents were nowhere in earshot. \u201cIt\u2019s not like that.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cBut you </span>\n<em>\n<span>were</span>\n</em>\n<span> hoping it would be him.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I guess.\u201d Steve leaned against the kitchen counter. It </span>\n<em>\n<span>would </span>\n</em>\n<span>be nice if Eddie called him. \u201cWe haven\u2019t really talked since\u2026you know.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhat?\u201d Robin\u2019s voice was shrill. \u201cAre you serious? Why haven\u2019t you called him? What\u2019s wrong with you?\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHey, the phone goes both ways, Robin.\u201d Steve cringed. It sounded like something his dad would say.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cJust like you, apparently.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Steve rolled his eyes. \u201cWhy are you even calling? What do you want?\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cCan\u2019t a girl call her best friend sometimes? Especially when he\u2019s late picking her up for work?\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWe don\u2019t work on Mondays.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIt\u2019s Tuesday.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Steve looked at his watch. \u201cOh, shit!\u201d They were supposed to be at work in 15 minutes. \u201cOkay, I\u2019ll be right there.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Steve sped out the door and to Robin\u2019s house. They made it to work only ten minutes late, which Steve thought wasn\u2019t that bad. Keith evidently disagreed, but he was in too much of a hurry to do more than glare.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Steve and Robin had the afternoon shift, which meant that they walked right into a rush of customers. Robin kept shooting Steve meaningful looks, but they didn\u2019t get a chance to talk. When things had finally slowed down a bit, she rounded on him.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cSteve! I can\u2019t believe you haven\u2019t talked to Eddie about what happened. What\u2019s wrong with you, seriously?\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Steve put his hands up. \u201cNothing\u2019s wrong with me, Robin. I\u2019ll talk to him, I just haven\u2019t had time.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOh, you\u2019ve had time to hang out with him basically every day this summer and now that you hooked up with him you don\u2019t have time?\u201d She hissed.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWe don\u2019t hang out every day,\u201d he deflected. It was true, anyway. They only hung out a few times a week.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cCome on, you hang out with him more than me these days.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAre you jealous?\u201d Steve raised an eyebrow</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNo.\u201d Robin held out her hands, eyes wide. \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure his companionship is filling a </span>\n<em>\n<span>very</span>\n</em>\n<span> different need for you. And anyway, that wasn\u2019t my point. You have to\u2013\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The bell at the door jingled, and Steve\u2019s stomach leapt as he saw Eddie walk through the door. He walked toward the counter, holding the video he had rented last time he was in. Some horror movie. He looked good. He looked the same as he always did: jeans, t-shirt, the jacket and vest combo that worked so well in a way Steve didn\u2019t understand. But today Steve just took more notice of how good he looked.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHey, Eddie!\u201d Robin said with conspicuous overenthusiasm. \u201cIt\u2019s </span>\n<em>\n<span>so </span>\n</em>\n<span>good to see you. How are you doing? What\u2019s new?\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOkay\u2026\u201d Eddie licked his lips. He did that a lot, as Steve had noticed basically the first day they met. Which, he suddenly realized, meant he had been paying too much attention to Eddie\u2019s lips for a while now. He decided to ignore that. \u201cSo you told Robin. Cool.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Steve winced. \u201cYeah, uh. Sorry.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Eddie crossed his arms. \u201cIt\u2019s fine. So, uh.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>They stared at each other for a moment, not saying anything. Steve couldn\u2019t think of anything to say, especially not inside the store. Robin stared at both of them.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOh!\u201d Robin checked her watch with an exaggerated gesture. \u201cSteve, I think it\u2019s time for your break.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>It wasn\u2019t, but Steve understood what she was doing. \u201cYeah,\u201d he said. \u201cYeah, I\u2019m gonna go\u2026out back.\u201d He made eye contact with Eddie, who nodded.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Steve walked through the back room of the store and out the back door. He took a deep breath. He thought about what he was going to say to Eddie and found that he didn\u2019t have anything remotely cool to say, so he was just going to have to be direct. Or at least try to.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHey,\u201d Eddie said casually. \u201cHow are you doing?\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cGood,\u201d Steve paused. At the moment he felt pretty nervous, but he wasn\u2019t going to say that. \u201cYeah, I\u2019m good. How are you?\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAlso good.\u201d Eddie fidgeted with his hands, twisting his rings around. Steve watched him do it for a moment, then looked away.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cSo, what did you tell Robin?\u201d Eddie asked, still looking down.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cJust that we, uh.\u201d Steve rubbed the back of his neck. \u201cHooked up. I didn\u2019t give her any details.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOkay.\u201d Eddie looked over at Steve. \u201cSo, are we good?\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYeah,\u201d Steve said. \u201cYeah, of course. I, uh, I had a really good time.\u201d Ugh. That sounded so stupid. Wasn\u2019t he supposed to be good at this kind of stuff?\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cMe too.\u201d Eddie gave him a half-smile.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Steve got lost in Eddie\u2019s huge ridiculous doe eyes for a moment. He had to look away so he could think clearly enough to say something. \u201cSo we can keep hanging out?\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHanging out, or </span>\n<em>\n<span>hanging out</span>\n</em>\n<span>?\u201d Eddie said the second one with finger quotes.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cUh.\u201d Steve shrugged. \u201cPreferably both?\u201d Yes, Steve wanted to do that again, and probably do other similar activities. But he also enjoyed spending time with Eddie. Watching movies, listening to music, and just enjoying each other\u2019s company. He was happy to do the friends with benefits thing, as long as the friends part stayed the same.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYeah.\u201d Eddie smiled. \u201cAgreed.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Steve smiled back.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cSo, do you want to come over tomorrow night? Watch a movie?\u201d The implication of what they would do after the movie hung in the air. Steve hoped he was picking up on that correctly.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYeah, definitely. Oh, also,\u201d Steve remembered. \u201cDo you want to go to a party with me and Robin on Saturday?\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWow, I didn\u2019t realize you two were such party animals.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWe\u2019re not,\u201d Steve said. \u201cIt\u2019s at one of her band friends\u2019 house. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s not gonna be that big of a thing.\u201d He couldn\u2019t imagine that band geeks got too wild. \u201cI\u2019ll drive this time.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cSounds good.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>They stood in silence for a bit longer, and then Steve checked his watch. \u201cI should get back in there,\u201d he said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t actually time for my break.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYeah, I could tell. Subtlety is not Robin\u2019s strong suit.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYeah, you\u2019re right. So, uh.\u201d Steve had the urge to hug Eddie goodbye, but he thought it would be weird, so he just nodded at him. \u201cSee you tomorrow.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Eddie nodded back. \u201cTomorrow,\u201d he said with a smile.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>After Eddie left, Steve went back inside the store.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHow did it go?\u201d Robin had an excited gleam in her eyes.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cFine.\u201d Steve shrugged nonchalantly. \u201cEverything\u2019s cool. We didn\u2019t even have that much to talk about. I told you, we discussed it before.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOkay, great,\u201d Robin said flatly. \u201cSo you\u2019re </span>\n<em>\n<span>both</span>\n</em>\n<span> emotionally stunted.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWe\u2019re not emotionally stunted, Robin, we\u2019re just\u2026it\u2019s casual. We\u2019re friends. Everything\u2019s good.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Robin rolled her eyes.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAnd he\u2019s coming with us to the party on Saturday.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOh, so now </span>\n<em>\n<span>you\u2019re</span>\n</em>\n<span> the one inviting a date to our hangouts.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIt\u2019s not a date! You\u2019re friends with him too! And besides, wasn\u2019t the whole reason you wanted to go to this thing because Vickie is supposed to be there?\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAlright.\u201d Robin sighed. \u201cFair enough.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>They finished their shift uneventfully and Steve dropped Robin off at home, making plans to pick her up on Saturday.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The next evening, Steve went to Eddie\u2019s place again. They watched another movie, something that was less gross, at Steve\u2019s request. They tried the wrist-tying thing again, and Steve didn\u2019t freak out this time, so they tried it again with less clothing. Things happened pretty similarly to how they had the first time, except with Steve tied up. He spent the night again. He wasn\u2019t sure if that was normal for friends with benefits, but he didn\u2019t really care. It worked for them.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>On Saturday, Steve picked up Robin and Eddie for the party. Robin gave him directions, and they ended up in a nice neighborhood, pulling up to a very large house that already seemed to have dozens of cars parked in front of it.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHow many people are gonna be at this party?\u201d Steve asked Robin.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Robin said defensively. \u201cI didn\u2019t plan it, I was just invited to it. I kind of thought I was pushing it by bringing you two.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cApparently not.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>They found a place to park, and heard loud music as soon as they got out of the car.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Eddie looked nervous. \u201cI thought you said this party was going to be a bunch of band geeks.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI guess band geeks get wilder than I thought they did.\u201d Steve had been to parties like this before, but they certainly hadn\u2019t been thrown by the kids from the school band. Maybe there were wild band parties happening all along, and Steve just wasn\u2019t invited.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201c</span>\n<em>\n<span>I </span>\n</em>\n<span>don\u2019t.\u201d\u00a0 Robin\u2019s eyes were wide. \u201cThis isn\u2019t what I was expecting either.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>They walked toward the house. There were empty cans and cups littered on the front lawn, and the front door was wide open. As they walked in, Steve felt eyes on them, and saw a few people whispering as they watched.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI shouldn\u2019t be here,\u201d Eddie said, his eyes darting back and forth. \u201cThere are way too many people here.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Spring break wasn\u2019t that long ago. Yes, the U.S. government had stepped in, making sure that there was a believable cover story and Eddie was fully exonerated, but that didn\u2019t mean people had forgotten about it. They had thought Eddie was some sort of possessed satanist serial killer, and that wasn\u2019t so easy to forget. Eddie hadn\u2019t been a particularly popular guy to start with, but that hadn\u2019t bothered him much, as far as Steve was aware. He had always seemed to be pretty confident regardless of what other people thought about him. But now he had everything from spring break hanging over his head, and his confidence had clearly been shaken.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d Robin put a comforting hand on Eddie\u2019s back. Steve wished he could do the same. \u201cLet\u2019s just try to have fun. If it gets too weird, we\u2019ll bail.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>They passed a table full of drinks. Steve grabbed one and put it in Eddie\u2019s hand.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThe music is terrible,\u201d Eddie said, frowning as he took a swig of his drink.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYeah,\u201d Robin said. She smiled up at Eddie. \u201cYeah, it totally is. So come dance with me, okay?\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Robin looked at Steve, who gave her a little nod, and she pulled Eddie by the hand toward a group of people who were dancing. Steve watched his friends with affection. They were both terrible dancers, but after a few minutes Eddie at least seemed calmer, more comfortable.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cSteve!\u201d he heard, and turned toward the voice to find that it belonged to Nancy, walking over with Jonathan at her side.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHey,\u201d Steve said, raising his voice so he could be heard over the music. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cVickie invited us?\u201d Nancy said uncertainly. \u201cBut we haven\u2019t actually seen her yet. It\u2019s pretty crowded.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYeah,\u201d Steve said. \u201cI didn\u2019t really expect this. You guys are friends with Vickie now?\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Nancy shrugged. \u201cWe talked to her when she came over for Jonathan\u2019s party. She\u2019s nice.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Steve glanced over at Robin and Eddie, and Nancy followed his gaze. \u201cDid you come with them?\u201d She asked.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYeah.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Nancy watched Robin and Eddie for a moment and smiled. \u201cThey\u2019re cute together.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Steve laughed. \u201cNo. They\u2019re just friends. We\u2019re just\u2026three friends who drove here together.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWell, they look </span>\n<em>\n<span>really</span>\n</em>\n<span> friendly,\u201d she said. She turned to Jonathan. \u201cDon\u2019t you think they would be cute together?\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Jonathan shrugged one shoulder, looking away.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhat?\u201d Nancy asked.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Jonathan said, shuffling his feet. \u201cI heard\u2026\u201d he trailed off.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhat did you hear?\u201d Steve felt suddenly defensive. He had a feeling he knew what Jonathan was going to say, but he wasn\u2019t sure if it was going to be about Eddie or Robin.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Jonathan shrugged again. \u201cJust some guys said\u2026\u201d He paused. \u201cEddie might be gay.\u201d Steve somehow doubted that the guys in question had said </span>\n<em>\n<span>gay</span>\n</em>\n<span>, and it pissed him off. He was glad, at least, that Jonathan wasn\u2019t using whatever word they had probably chosen.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Steve didn\u2019t know what to say. He knew he should deny it, but he wasn\u2019t sure how to do that without making it sound like he thought being gay was a bad thing.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Nancy laughed. \u201cEddie? I doubt it.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWell, Steve would know better than me,\u201d Jonathan said, gesturing to him.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Steve froze. \u201cWhat\u2019s that supposed to mean?\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Jonathan\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cI just meant, you\u2019re better friends with him than we are. I don\u2019t really know him that well. He\u2019s cool, I wouldn\u2019t care if he was gay. My\u2013 I know gay people.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<span>My brother is gay</span>\n</em>\n<span>. That was almost certainly what Jonathan had just stopped himself from saying. Steve should have assumed he knew. Should have assumed he was cool with it. He was getting defensive for no reason.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYeah,\u201d Steve said, trying to keep his voice measured. \u201cPretty sure we know the same gay person.\u201d He didn\u2019t know if Nancy knew, so he didn\u2019t want to say Will\u2019s name. \u201cIt\u2019s not Eddie, though.\u201d Wait, did that sound </span>\n<em>\n<span>too</span>\n</em>\n<span> certain? \u201cAs far as I know,\u201d he added, hoping it sounded casual.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYeah, I mean, of course it wouldn\u2019t </span>\n<em>\n<span>matter</span>\n</em>\n<span> if he was,\u201d Nancy said. Steve wondered if she really believed that, and how far she would extend that acceptance. To Robin? To Steve? \u201cI just don\u2019t think he is.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cRobin likes someone else, anyway,\u201d Steve said, just to change the subject.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWho?\u201d Nancy\u2019s eyes lit up. \u201cWait, no, don\u2019t tell me. I should talk to her myself. We haven\u2019t hung out one-on-one since spring break; I should plan something with her. It\u2019s really nice to have a girl friend again. I haven\u2019t really, not since\u2013\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Barb. Okay. This conversation was going in all the worst directions that it possibly could.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYeah,\u201d Steve said, trying to back up a bit. \u201cYou should call her, she would definitely be interested.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Steve looked back over at where Eddie and Robin had been dancing, but they were both gone. \u201cDid you see where they went?\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Nancy shook her head, looked to Jonathan, who shrugged again.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWe were supposed to stay close,\u201d he explained. \u201cIn case we wanted to bail.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou could just wait here for them,\u201d Jonathan said. \u201cSo they know where you are.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYeah.\u201d\u00a0 Nancy smiled. \u201cWe\u2019ll wait with you.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThanks.\u201d He wasn\u2019t sure if he wanted to stand around talking to Nancy and Jonathan all night, but he supposed it was better than navigating a large, crowded house party by himself.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>They talked for a while, and Steve was surprised by how comfortable he was talking to them. Any residual jealousy seemed to have melted away, and he could talk to them like he would any other friends. It was mostly small talk, but he didn\u2019t mind. It was a huge relief to know that everything was fine between them.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>They had been talking for quite some time, Steve occasionally glancing around to see if he could spot either Robin or Eddie, when Steve felt an arm come to rest around his shoulders.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHarrington! There you are!\u201d It was Eddie.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYeah, right where you left me,\u201d Steve said.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Eddie nodded at Jonathan and Nancy. \u201cHey, dudes. How\u2019s it going?\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cGood,\u201d Nancy said, looking at Eddie with some concern. Steve saw her eyes pass over the arm that was wrapped around him, and he shrugged Eddie off, remembering their earlier conversation. Eddie stumbled.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhoa, okay,\u201d Steve said, grabbing Eddie\u2019s arm to steady him. \u201cAre you drunk?\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYep. I lost Robin, but then I found shots, so\u2026\u201d He gestured broadly, as though presenting himself. \u201cHere we are.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHow many shots did you have?\u201d Steve didn\u2019t think they had been separated that long. Eddie had managed to get himself about as drunk as Steve had been at the last party they\u2019d gone to, but he\u2019d done it in less than an hour.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIt\u2019s impossible to know for sure,\u201d Eddie said seriously.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOkay,\u201d Steve said slowly. \u201cAs long as you\u2019re having a good time, I guess.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOh no,\u201d Eddie laughed. \u201cYou misunderstand. I\u2019m having a terrible time.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Steve glanced over at Nancy and Jonathan, who were both frozen, watching Eddie. He couldn\u2019t blame them. He figured they must be worried about Eddie, because he certainly was.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI got called a freak about a dozen times, and a fag twice,\u201d Eddie said, listing them off on his fingers.\u00a0\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Steve cringed, both at the word itself and the implication. He was angry that someone had said that, and wished he had been there to do something about it, though he wasn\u2019t sure what. He was mad enough hearing about it secondhand, so maybe it was better that he wasn\u2019t there to start a fight. He also hoped Eddie wouldn\u2019t regret saying all of that in front of Jonathan and Nancy.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cBut, you know, I\u2019m used to those,\u201d he said lightly. \u201cI can handle them.\u201d A dark expression came over his face and his voice lost its humor. \u201cIt\u2019s </span>\n<em>\n<span>murderer</span>\n</em>\n<span> that really stings.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cEddie\u2026\u201d Steve wasn\u2019t sure what to say. He wanted to reassure Eddie, to make him feel better, but it was really hard to think positively when so many people still believed those horrible things.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Nancy was the one who spoke up. \u201cThey don\u2019t know what they\u2019re talking about, Eddie,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019re a hero. You saved Steve and Robin and me more than once. And you helped save the world. I just wish everyone could know that.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Eddie softened. \u201cThanks, Nance. That- that really means a lot.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Steve smiled at Nancy. He was incredibly grateful, but also a little embarrassed that he hadn\u2019t thought to say those things himself. He should have been the one to comfort Eddie. He was Eddie\u2019s\u2026good friend.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cDo you wanna go?\u201d Steve asked. At least he could do that for Eddie. He could take him home.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYeah, this party fucking blows.\u201d He inclined his head toward Nancy. \u201cExcuse my language.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Nancy laughed, but she still looked worried. \u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAlright.\u201d Steve patted Eddie on the back. \u201cLet\u2019s go find Robin so we can get out of here.\u201d He looked to Jonathan and Nancy. \u201cSee you guys later.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Eddie was quiet as they walked through the house together, looking for Robin. Steve still wasn\u2019t quite sure what to say. He wanted to ask if Eddie was okay, but it was clear that he wasn\u2019t, so what good would that do?\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>They had been walking around the house for about ten minutes, squeezing through the crowds and not talking to each other, when Robin burst out from behind a closed door, almost slamming into Steve.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cSteve!\u201d she said. \u201cWe have to go. Right now.\u201d She grabbed both of their hands and began dragging them toward the front door of the house.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOkay, okay,\u201d Steve said. \u201cWe wanted to go anyway. We were looking for you. What\u2019s wrong?\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNot here.\u201d Her voice was frantic. \u201cCome on, let\u2019s go.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Robin dragged them most of the way to Steve\u2019s car, where she quickly got into the passenger seat. Steve started the car.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAre you going to tell us what\u2019s going on?\u201d he asked.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI kissed Vickie. Or, Vickie kissed me. I don\u2019t know. It happened so fast.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHey!\u201d Eddie exclaimed from the back seat, where he was now lying down. \u201cNice!\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhat?\u201d Steve looked at her incredulously. \u201cSo why are you running away?\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Robin said, throwing her hands up. \u201cIt got weird. We were talking, and then all the sudden we were kissing, and then she was like, </span>\n<em>\n<span>oh my god, I\u2019ve never kissed a girl before,</span>\n</em>\n<span> and I was like, </span>\n<em>\n<span>me neither. </span>\n</em>\n<span>And she was like, </span>\n<em>\n<span>oh my god, that\u2019s so funny, </span>\n</em>\n<span>and then\u2013\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cSlow down,\u201d Eddie said, pinching the bridge of his nose and shaking his head. \u201cSlow down, I have no idea what\u2019s going on.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Robin twisted around to look in the back seat. \u201cAre you drunk?\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYes,\u201d Eddie said in a matter-of-fact tone. \u201cObviously.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Steve started driving. \u201cRobin, why are you here right now and not in there making out with Vickie?\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI told her I had to go.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhy?\u201d Steve was glad they were leaving, but he would have stuck around a while for Robin\u2019s sake, or at least waited in the car.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t even know why she kissed me.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou could have asked. Or just not asked, and just kissed her more.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNo! I don\u2019t know. What if she doesn\u2019t like me like that?\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cRobin, why would she kiss you if she didn\u2019t like you like that?\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI don\u2019t know! Maybe it was like, a friend kiss.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cA friend kiss? What even is a friend kiss?\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOh, that\u2019s rich coming from you, Mr. </span>\n<em>\n<span>just casual sex between friends.</span>\n</em>\n<span>\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cShe\u2019s got you there, Harrington.\u201d Eddie lifted a finger, inclining it toward Steve. \u201cYou have definitely done some friend kissing. And also friend\u2013\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOkay!\u201d Steve didn\u2019t know what word was going to come out of Eddie\u2019s mouth next, but he didn\u2019t think he wanted Robin to hear it. \u201cThat\u2019s enough.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cDon\u2019t tell me what to do, Harrington.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cFine,\u201d Steve said. \u201cJust\u2013\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cUsually you prefer when I tell </span>\n<em>\n<span>you</span>\n</em>\n<span> what to do.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOh my god,\u201d Robin said, turning to look at Eddie with wide eyes and a huge grin. \u201cWhat?\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Eddie sat up and leaned close to Robin. \u201cLet me tell you\u2013\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cPlease do not!\u201d Steve interrupted. \u201cRobin, what about Vickie? Talk more about that.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThere\u2019s not much more to say,\u201d Robin said. \u201cI kind of just panicked and left.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWell, you\u2019ve gotta call her tomorrow,\u201d Steve said. \u201cShe\u2019s going to think you freaked out because you\u2019re not into girls, instead of just because you\u2019re super awkward.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHey!\u201d she exclaimed.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, Robin,\u201d Eddie said. \u201cEveryone\u2019s first kiss is awkward. Don\u2019t worry about it.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThanks for being supportive, Eddie,\u201d Robin said with a pointed look toward Steve.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhat?\u201d Steve asked. \u201cI\u2019m supportive! I\u2019m super supportive!\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Robin turned toward Eddie. \u201cYou know, maybe you\u2019re too good for him.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cSeriously?\u201d Steve threw one hand in the air, the other still on the steering wheel.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Eddie laughed, laying down in the back seat again.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>They got to Robin\u2019s house, and she opened the passenger side door.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cRobin, for real,\u201d Steve said as she got out of the car. \u201cCall her. She definitely likes you.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOkay,\u201d Robin said. She still looked nervous, but she nodded. \u201cI will. I promise.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>As Steve drove off again, he smiled and shook his head. \u201cI\u2019m glad you didn\u2019t say any of that stuff around Nancy and Jonathan.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNah,\u201d Eddie said. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t do that. I wasn\u2019t even going to tell her anything. I just like making you squirm.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYeah, I\u2019ve figured that out.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>When they got to the trailer park, Eddie sat up again and leaned over Steve\u2019s shoulder. \u201cYou should come inside,\u201d he said.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNo.\u201d Steve said. It wasn\u2019t that he didn\u2019t want to. He just knew it wouldn\u2019t be right. \u201cYou\u2019re drunk.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d Eddie\u2019s face was close to Steve\u2019s, his hair falling over Steve\u2019s shoulder. It took every ounce of willpower he had to resist.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNot when you\u2019re this drunk,\u201d he said. \u201cThat would be breaking your rule.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThat rule\u2019s for you, not me.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThat\u2019s a double standard.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNo,\u201d Eddie said. He moved his head off of Steve\u2019s shoulder and leaned on the back of the passenger seat, looking at him. \u201cNo, you might do something you would regret if you were drunk. It doesn\u2019t matter what you do to me.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWow,\u201d Steve\u2019s eyebrows shot up, and he turned to look at Eddie\u2019s face.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter what I do to you,\u201d he repeated flatly. \u201cYou really know how to sweet talk a guy.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Eddie shook his head. \u201cI just mean, it\u2019s- I\u2019ve done it all before, Steve. You don\u2019t have to worry about me. You don\u2019t have to care about me like that.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhat?\u201d Steve drew his head back quickly, surprised. \u201cOf course I care about you. You\u2019re my friend.\u201d Eddie\u2019s past experience had no bearing on that.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cUgh.\u201d Eddie tilted his head back. \u201cThat\u2019s not what I meant.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhat did you mean, then?\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Eddie took a deep breath, then looked at Steve again, nodding. \u201cYou\u2019re right, Steve. It\u2019s a double standard. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Steve shrugged. Eddie hadn\u2019t really answered the question. \u201cIt- It\u2019s okay.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cSo. Goodnight, Steve.\u201d He started to move away.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWait, wait,\u201d Steve said. He pulled Eddie close for just a moment, kissing him gently. Eddie tasted like cigarettes and cheap tequila, and Steve didn\u2019t want to stop. But he did. \u201cGoodnight.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Steve drove home, thinking about what Eddie had said. He had always thought Eddie was so confident, so self-assured. But he had seen a different side of Eddie tonight. Eddie had been scared at the party. It made sense, considering how recently he\u2019d had an actual murderous mob after him. Of course he was afraid of what those people would think, and what they might do because of it. And of course he had been upset, when they said all those things about him. But what Eddie had been saying in the car\u2013 Steve still wasn\u2019t quite sure what he had meant by all that. Steve shouldn\u2019t care about him? It didn\u2019t matter what he did to him? Despite his outward confidence, Eddie obviously had some serious self-esteem issues.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Steve had trouble getting to sleep that night. He couldn\u2019t stop thinking about Eddie. What he had said made Steve feel a little sick. It sounded like he didn\u2019t think he was worthy of being cared about, or at least not worthy of the same consideration he always gave Steve. It couldn\u2019t just be spring break that made him think those things. It felt a lot deeper than that. He must have been bullied, considering the words he had mentioned he was used to hearing. Eddie spent so much time insisting that he didn\u2019t care what people thought about him, but it was clear that someone\u2019s words had gotten under his skin at some point. And Steve also remembered when Eddie said he related to Will\u2019s dad being a piece of shit. What did that mean?\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>When he woke up the next morning, Steve was still worried about Eddie. As he got ready, he tried to think of something he could do to make Eddie feel better about the previous night, and to show him that he cared. He thought about the last time the two of them had been at a party together, and he realized that Eddie had already shown him the perfect way.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Soon, he was knocking on Eddie\u2019s door. An exhausted, hungover Eddie answered, with bedhead and pajamas. Well, he had at least managed to change. That was better than Steve had done after the last party.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHarrington,\u201d Eddie said, brow furrowed. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHey.\u201d Steve smiled hesitantly. \u201cBreakfast?\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Eddie laughed lightly, biting his lip. \u201cYeah. Yeah, okay.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>After several nights together, all featuring variations on the same kind of thing, Steve was starting to get restless. He wanted more, and he was pretty sure Eddie did too, based on how he looked at Steve, all flashing eyes and devilish smile. Eddie had made it very clear that, despite the dynamic in the bedroom, Steve was steering this ship. He was the one who set the boundaries, the pace, the schedule. So Steve had to find the nerve to tell Eddie what he wanted.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>One evening, when they were half-naked and making out, Steve decided it was as good a time as any to ask. \u201cDo you want to do something else tonight?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cLike what?\u201d Eddie asked. \u201cPlay monopoly?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNo,\u201d Steve said. \u201cI mean like\u2014\u201c He didn\u2019t know why he was having such a hard time putting it into words. Steve had never been shy about sex. \u201cYou\u2019re the gay sex expert. What other kinds of gay sex are there?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t necessarily call myself an expert, but thanks. And you don\u2019t have to keep saying </span>\n<em>\n<span>gay sex. </span>\n</em>\n<span>It\u2019s kind of implied, considering the fact that we\u2019re two men having sex.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cFine. What kinds of sex could we be having together, as two men?\u201d Just two guys, being bros. Two friends having sex. Two pals doing\u2014</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOral, anal, intercrural\u2026\u201d Eddie listed off, counting on his fingers.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOkay.\u201d Steve interrupted him. \u201cI don\u2019t know what that last one is but I\u2019m pretty sure I don\u2019t want to do anal.\u201d He didn\u2019t rule out the possibility for the future, but right now, the idea was a little scary.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThat\u2019s fine. It\u2019s not that different from doing it with a girl, though, just for future reference. I mean, so I\u2019ve heard.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure it would be </span>\n<em>\n<span>very </span>\n</em>\n<span>different from when I do it with a girl, considering your left side bandana, which, if I remember correctly, indicates that you\u2019re a top.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOh,\u201d Eddie said. \u201cWell, I do usually top, but for me it\u2019s more of an indication on the BDSM side of things. I want to be the dominant one. I can do that either way.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Steve hadn\u2019t thought of it that way. And because he hadn\u2019t thought of it that way, he hadn\u2019t even entertained the notion that Eddie might want to do it that way. \u201cReally?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYeah, of course. I can be dominant doing anything.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhat about blowjobs? There\u2019s no way anyone can be dominant while giving a blowjob.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIs that a challenge, Harrington?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>It hadn\u2019t been, but it very much was now. \u201cYes. It definitely is.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI accept your challenge,\u201d Eddie said. \u201cLay on your back and put your arms up.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNow?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIf you\u2019re ready.\u201d Eddie didn\u2019t say that part as a challenge. Despite their now-running joke, Eddie didn\u2019t issue challenges, not sexually. Everything was discussed, negotiated. He always made sure Steve was comfortable before taking control.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYeah, I\u2019m ready.\u201d Steve said, laying back as Eddie had asked.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cGood job.\u201d Eddie looked Steve over with a smile.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWow, thanks,\u201d Steve said. \u201cDo I get a gold star?\u201d Despite the sarcasm, Eddie\u2019s approval did something to him.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWe\u2019ll have to see how you do on the exam.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Eddie stood, opening his nightstand to pull out some rope. They had long since moved on from the bandana, with Eddie introducing Steve to a variety of different types of restraints.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Eddie made quick work of tying Steve\u2019s wrists to the headboard. Steve tilted his head toward Eddie, watching him intently. He hadn\u2019t spent much time looking at Eddie\u2019s body the first time they got naked, but he took the opportunity as often as he could after that. He had been surprised when he realized how fit Eddie was. He was thin, but with broad shoulders, muscular arms. He must work out. Eddie was full of surprises.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>And then there were tattoos. Steve had never liked tattoos, or maybe just hadn\u2019t thought about them that much. But on Eddie, Steve was definitely a fan. His eyes lingered on the one on Eddie\u2019s chest.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Eddie finished tying Steve\u2019s wrists and moved down between Steve\u2019s legs. He unbuttoned Steve\u2019s pants and quickly finished undressing him, then spread his legs apart and started tying his ankles as well.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWell, obviously you can be dominant if I can\u2019t even move.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Eddie didn\u2019t look up from what he was doing. \u201cOh, you\u2019re not going to move? Is that a promise?\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou\u2019re making it pretty difficult right now.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIf you say so, Harrington. In that case, you\u2019d better stay still.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI don\u2019t really see how I have any other choice.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Eddie slapped Steve\u2019s inner thigh. Steve flinched. He couldn\u2019t help it. He liked it, but it caught him off guard. Which was actually a good thing, as Steve had learned. A little pain got Steve worked up, it turned out. And the surprise only added to that.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou moved,\u201d Eddie said.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhat?\u201d Of course he had moved. It wasn\u2019t like he could go far, but he couldn\u2019t have avoided reacting to that.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou said you were going to stay still.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou know that\u2019s not what I meant.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIt\u2019s what you said, though.\u201d Eddie\u2019s tone was playful, but with a dangerous edge to it. \u201cSo I\u2019m going to hold you to it.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cCome on,\u201d Steve said. \u201cThat\u2019s not possible. I can\u2019t stay completely still.\u201d If he was having trouble doing it now, it was going to be </span>\n<em>\n<span>much</span>\n</em>\n<span> more difficult once they really got going.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYeah, completely still,\u201d Eddie echoed. \u201cI think </span>\n<em>\n<span>quiet</span>\n</em>\n<span>, too. You\u2019re getting a little whiny.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Steve stared at Eddie for a moment, then couldn\u2019t resist saying more. \u201cI\u2019m not\u2013\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cDo I need to gag you, Harrington?\u201d Eddie spoke quietly, but firmly. He had that expression again, the one where he looked like he wanted to eat Steve alive. And maybe, if Steve played his cards right, he would.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Steve shook his head, bewildered.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOkay, good.\u201d Eddie settled between Steve\u2019s legs. He stroked his hands up Steve\u2019s thighs.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Steve breathed in deeply, willing himself not to lift his hips. Eddie moved up Steve\u2019s body, pressing soft kisses to his stomach, hands raking through his chest hair and lingering on his nipples. No one had ever bothered to touch Steve\u2019s nipples before Eddie, and Steve felt like he had really been missing out. Eddie took Steve\u2019s dick in his hand. Steve lifted his head to watch as Eddie finally put his mouth on him. He sucked gently at the tip for a few seconds and then lifted his head, taking his hand away at the same time.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Eddie looked at Steve admonishingly. \u201cYou moved already.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI just- I just wanted to look at you.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Eddie cracked a smile. \u201cOkay, that\u2019s pretty cute.\u201d He lifted his hands in surrender. \u201cFine, you can look as much as you want. And I\u2019ll forgive the talking, but just this once.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Eddie started again, slowly but confidently. It took Steve\u2019s entire force of will to not move. When Eddie looked up at him with his mouth around Steve\u2019s dick, he had to look away. He couldn\u2019t look at those huge brown eyes right now, or he was really going to lose control. He clenched his fists.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Steve lay back for a moment, then he looked at Eddie again. Eddie had one hand on the base of Steve\u2019s cock, the other pressing against Steve\u2019s thigh as he sucked him slowly. Steve was breathing hard, biting his lip, trying not to let Eddie see how strongly he was reacting. Eddie was good. He sped up gradually, building the tension but not taking Steve over the edge too quickly. Steve was glad about that; he wanted this to last.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>But maybe Eddie was </span>\n<em>\n<span>too</span>\n</em>\n<span> good, because after a few minutes, Steve felt himself starting to get close. He felt like he should warn someone before coming in their mouth, but Eddie had told him not to talk. Technically he had told him to be quiet, but Steve couldn\u2019t help the gasping breaths or soft little noises in his throat.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cEddie,\u201d Steve said, when he was right on the edge, almost too late.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Eddie quickly took his mouth and hand away, looking at him with a frown. \u201cWhat did I tell you?\u201d he asked</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHuh?\u201d Steve was confused. He had been </span>\n<em>\n<span>right there</span>\n</em>\n<span> and now he was sitting unsatisfied as the pleasure started to recede. \u201cWhat- what\u2019s wrong?\u201d Eddie must have stopped for some reason.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI told you to be quiet,\u201d Eddie said. His voice was almost apologetic, but Steve knew it was an act. He was messing with him.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOkay,\u201d Steve said, breathing still ragged. \u201cOkay, I\u2019ll be quiet.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAnd still,\u201d Eddie added.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYeah,\u201d Steve said. \u201cYeah, just- Please?\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Eddie smiled at that, and stroked Steve\u2019s dick slowly before wrapping his lips around it again. His pace was a little quicker this time, but he wasn\u2019t going as far down as he had before. Steve could tell it was on purpose. Eddie was too good. Every move he made was calculated to make Steve break. To give in, lift his hips to get just a tiny bit further into Eddie\u2019s mouth.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Steve refused to give in, though the effort was taking a toll on him. His breathing was fast, erratic, and the involuntary noises were even harder to hold back. Steve had never been particularly loud during sex, but this was bringing it out in him.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>As he got close again, Steve tried to be quiet, but he couldn\u2019t. Eddie didn\u2019t stop even when Steve let out a noise somewhere between a whimper and moan, something he would have been humiliated to do if he were having sex with anyone else. He clenched and unclenched his hands, just trying to make it there without breaking any of Eddie\u2019s rules.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>And then he was there again, the tension built up as high as it could go, right on the edge, when he felt his hips shift against his will. He had just barely thrust up into Eddie\u2019s mouth, trying to get that last bit of stimulation so he could finally come.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>And Eddie was off him again as quickly as before.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cPlease, Eddie.\u201d Steve felt delirious. He didn\u2019t know how much more he could take. \u201cPlease.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Eddie tilted his head, looked at Steve with a soft expression. \u201cYou\u2019re real pretty when you beg, Harrington.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Steve didn\u2019t know how to respond to that. No one had ever called him pretty and meant it as a compliment.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou know,\u201d Eddie said gently. \u201cYou could have come a long time ago if you just listened to me.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI tried!\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cTry harder.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Eddie put his mouth on Steve again, sucking harder and faster this time. The more times they did this, the more difficult it was for Steve to stay still, to stay quiet. He didn\u2019t know if he could make it.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>It took much less time for Steve to get to the edge, but it felt more intense, and when Steve heard himself cry out \u201c</span>\n<em>\n<span>fuck,\u201d </span>\n</em>\n<span>he was barely aware that the sound had come out of him.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou\u2019re not very good at this, Harrington.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d Steve said. \u201cI can\u2019t. Please, Eddie.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cBeg for it.\u201d There was fire in Eddie\u2019s eyes, and his tone was so firm that Steve didn\u2019t even consider disobeying.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201c</span>\n<em>\n<span>Please</span>\n</em>\n<span>,\u201d Steve said. \u201cPlease, Eddie.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cPlease </span>\n<em>\n<span>what</span>\n</em>\n<span>?\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cPlease let me come. Please just\u2026finish me off.\u201d Steve didn\u2019t mean for it to sound like he wanted Eddie to kill him, but at this point it was honestly one or the other. \u201cPlease, Eddie. I can\u2019t do it. I\u2019m begging you. Please.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Eddie smiled again, crookedly. \u201cOkay.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOkay?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYeah, you\u2019ve convinced me.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Steve didn\u2019t believe him. \u201cDon\u2019t fuck with me, Eddie.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI\u2019m not. Seriously, I\u2019ll let you come this time. And since you asked so nicely, you can move and talk as much as you want.\u201d Eddie held eye contact as he sunk down again, and Steve couldn\u2019t look away this time.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Eddie\u2019s mouth was so soft, and so hot, and Steve wanted so badly to thrust hard and fast into it, but he didn\u2019t want to hurt Eddie, so he just moved gently along with Eddie languid rhythm.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>After a minute, Eddie moved further, swallowing Steve all the way down, and it was over for him. He couldn\u2019t control his movements, his voice, or the feeling flooding through his whole body.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cFuck.\u201d Steve struggled at his bonds as he came. He could feel it all the way down to his toes and it seemed to come in waves. \u201cFuck, Eddie.\u201d All of the buildup had paid off in the form of the longest and most intense orgasm of Steve\u2019s life.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Eddie sucked him through it, digging his fingers, hard enough to hurt, into Steve\u2019s thigh. He didn\u2019t stop until Steve was quiet and still yet again. Then he sat back on his heels and stared at Steve, biting his lip. Steve wondered what he looked like, because Eddie was obviously enjoying the view.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cFuck you,\u201d Steve said as soon as he caught his breath. \u201cThat was\u2014\u201c intense, incredible, agonizing, mind-blowing. A lot of adjectives ran through Steve\u2019s mind. \u201cFuck you,\u201d he settled on.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou should be a little nicer to the person who just gave you the best head of your life.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou\u2019re confident.\u201d Steve tried to summon up the energy to be snarky, but he just sounded tired. Eddie\u2019s confidence was definitely not misplaced.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYeah, I am.\u201d Eddie turned away for a second, rubbing his jaw.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cToo much for you, Munson?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cDon\u2019t flatter yourself, Harrington. You\u2019re not all that.\u201d Eddie rolled his eyes. \u201cGot my jaw broken a while ago. It\u2019s given me trouble since then.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhat?\u201d Steve tried to sit up, but quickly realized he was still tied down. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Eddie noticed Steve struggling and started to untie him. \u201cLet a man have his mysteries, Steve.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNo, seriously.\u201d When Steve\u2019s arms were free, he lifted himself up on his elbows. \u201cThat\u2019s horrible. What happened?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it, Steve. It was a long time ago. Really. Just imagine the potential if it hadn\u2019t happened.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Steve thought about it, but he couldn\u2019t imagine any concrete ways that could have been better. \u201cThere would be no survivors,\u201d he said finally.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Eddie finished untying Steve, then slid in next to him, resting his head on Steve\u2019s chest. \u201cCut down in my prime,\u201d he said with a sigh.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Steve closed his eyes. He needed a breather before he even thought about moving again. He wrapped his arm around Eddie and stroked his hair. They lay like that for a few minutes.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHey, uh,\u201d Steve said, pulling away slightly so he could look at Eddie. \u201cYou want me to return the favor?\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to do that.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI want to,\u201d Steve said. He had thought about it a lot, actually. \u201cUnless you already\u2026\u201d he trailed off, glancing down at Eddie\u2019s crotch, still clad in his black jeans.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI didn\u2019t come in my pants, Steve. I\u2019m not thirteen.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThen why not?\u201d Steve smiled at him. \u201cCome on, Steve Harrington </span>\n<em>\n<span>always </span>\n</em>\n<span>reciprocates oral sex.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cSteve Harrington should stop talking about himself in the third person.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWell, if you think about it, Steve Harrington wouldn\u2019t be able to talk at all if he was going down on you.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI think my equipment\u2019s a little different than what you\u2019re used to working with.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Steve shrugged. \u201cSo maybe I\u2019ll need a little practice.\u201d He was sure he wouldn\u2019t be as good at it as Eddie was, but that was a high bar to clear.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI just don\u2019t want you to do anything you\u2019re not comfortable with.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cEddie, I\u2019m comfortable with it. I want to do it. Do you want me to?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYeah. Sure.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Steve smiled. \u201cOkay, then. How do you want me?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Eddie shrugged. \u201cHowever you want.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cEddie, seriously.\u201d They had started this for Steve\u2019s benefit. So he could experiment, figure things out. Steve was well aware of that, and he appreciated how Eddie was always so respectful of his boundaries. But Steve wanted Eddie to get something out of this, too. \u201cI want it to be good for you. I mean, keep your expectations low, it\u2019s my first time, but\u2026\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Eddie disentangled himself from Steve and sat on the edge of the bed. Steve stood up, and when he was in front of him, Eddie spread his legs and gestured to the floor with both hands at his thighs.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Steve sank to his knees and looked up at Eddie. \u201cLike this?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYeah.\u201d Eddie ran his fingers through Steve\u2019s hair. \u201cYeah, that\u2019s perfect.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Steve unzipped Eddie\u2019s pants and Eddie stood so he could pull them off. Eddie was already hard, and Steve\u2019s heart was beating fast.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOkay, um.\u201d Steve was suddenly nervous. \u201cJust tell me if I do something wrong, or\u2014\u201c</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t worry about that,\u201d Eddie said. \u201cI\u2019m gonna be honest, the sight of Steve Harrington on his knees for me is doing a lot of the work here.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI thought we weren\u2019t talking about Steve Harrington in the third person.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Eddie took Steve\u2019s chin in his hand, pressed his thumb over Steve\u2019s lips. \u201cShut up, Harrington.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>On impulse, Steve parted his lips and sucked Eddie\u2019s thumb into his mouth, still looking up at him.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cJesus Christ,\u201d Eddie said, leaning his head back and closing his eyes. \u201cYou\u2019re going to kill me.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Steve really liked that he could have this effect on Eddie. Obviously he liked it when Eddie focused on him, but seeing how much he could turn Eddie on was a particular thrill.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Eddie made eye contact again and slowly pulled his thumb out of Steve\u2019s mouth, dragging it along his lower lip.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAlright,\u201d Eddie said, his voice back to the quiet, measured tone he tended to use during sex. The tone that showed Steve who was in charge. \u201cLet\u2019s put that pretty mouth of yours to good use, Harrington.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Steve leaned forward slowly. He wrapped his hand around the base of Eddie\u2019s dick and slowly stroked it a few times. That part he had done before. He had gotten used to it, started to learn how Eddie liked it. The next part made him nervous.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cSteve.\u201d This voice was different. This was the sweet, caring Eddie who always held Steve, stroked his hair, made him feel safe. \u201cYou can stop anytime you want, okay?\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYeah,\u201d Steve said. \u201cI know.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Something about that gave him confidence, and he leaned forward, wrapping his lips around the tip of Eddie\u2019s dick. He felt like he had never been more conscious of his teeth in his life, especially as he started moving downward, trying to position his lips and tongue so he wouldn\u2019t accidentally scrape Eddie\u2019s skin. He didn\u2019t dare go too deep, afraid of choking, so he moved his hand in time with his mouth, finding a rhythm.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Eddie watched intently, pushing Steve\u2019s hair back from his forehead. \u201cThat\u2019s it,\u201d he said softly. \u201cYou\u2019re doing so good.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Steve huffed out a breath through his nose, eyes fluttering closed. Why was </span>\n<em>\n<span>that</span>\n</em>\n<span> what got him flustered? He was sucking a dick for the first time, and it was some light praise that got him going?\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Eddie must have sensed his reaction, known what was causing it, because he ran his hand through Steve\u2019s hair again, leaning back with his other hand flat on the bed. \u201cYou look so good like this,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re so good for me, Steve.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Eddie kept up a constant stream of praise and Steve let the words wash over him as he sank into a state of pure sensation. The sound of Eddie\u2019s voice, the taste of him, the weight on Steve\u2019s tongue, Eddie\u2019s hand in his hair sending goosebumps down his spine. It all wrapped around him like a warm blanket, like sinking into a bath. He felt like he was floating, with Eddie, in a world where nothing else existed.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>He wasn\u2019t sure how long he had been at it when Eddie\u2019s voice got sharper, breaking him out of the haze.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cSteve, I\u2019m-\u201d He tugged Steve\u2019s hair gently, more to get his attention than to hurt. \u201cI\u2019m really close, so unless\u2013\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Steve had snapped out of the dreamlike state he\u2019d been in, but he still didn\u2019t stop. He wanted to make Eddie come. He wasn\u2019t afraid of it. He picked up his pace a bit, feeling Eddie\u2019s hand tighten in his hair.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Eddie came, barely making a noise, but Eddie was always quiet. At least compared to Steve, who had never been loud in bed until he\u2019d met Eddie. Steve kept his mouth on Eddie while he came, and, well, it wasn\u2019t the </span>\n<em>\n<span>worst</span>\n</em>\n<span> thing Steve had ever tasted. The force of it against his throat was a little surprising, though, and he coughed a bit before swallowing.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>When Eddie\u2019s grip on Steve\u2019s hair slackened, Steve slowly moved away, tilting his head up to look at Eddie.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Eddie was looking down at Steve with an expression he couldn\u2019t identify. Affection, surprise, maybe even pride?\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cGood?\u201d Steve asked. They were both breathing hard, and it was all Steve could get out.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Eddie nodded, let out a small laugh, and coaxed Steve into a standing position, pulling him close into a tight embrace. Steve\u2019s knees were weak, and he felt a little dizzy, but in a good way, almost like he\u2019d been drinking.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>They fell onto the bed together, intertwined, and lay like that for a while before Eddie spoke.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me you have a praise kink?\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Steve shook his head. \u201cI don\u2019t know what that means.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOkay, well, you have one.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cGood to know. Is that why\u2013\u201d Steve felt mostly normal now, but he had felt different a moment ago. \u201cI don\u2019t know, I felt really weird. But in a good way,\u201d he added quickly. Maybe he just </span>\n<em>\n<span>really</span>\n</em>\n<span> liked sucking dick, but he had a feeling that wasn\u2019t all it was.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cDid you feel\u2026floaty?\u201d Eddie asked. \u201cLike an out-of-body experience?\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYeah.\u201d Steve lifted his head off the pillow, looking at Eddie curiously. \u201cHow did you know?\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThat\u2019s subspace.\u201d Eddie raised his eyebrows, looking impressed. \u201cDamn. I knew you were a natural.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Steve was familiar with the terms dom and sub; intimately so, by this point. But he had never heard that one.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhat\u2019s subspace?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIt\u2019s a euphoric state that people sometimes go into when they\u2019re being submissive. Kind of like a trance or something.\u201d Eddie brushed a lock of hair off of Steve\u2019s forehead. \u201cIt was really hot.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAre you doing the praise thing again now?\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cA little. But I also just think it\u2019s really cool that it happened.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhy, because it means you\u2019re a really great dom?\u201d Steve teased.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cMore like you\u2019re a really great sub.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Or maybe they were just really great together. Steve wanted to say it, but he couldn\u2019t. He was too afraid Eddie would take it the wrong way. He was kind of afraid that he felt it the wrong way.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cSee, now I\u2019m never going to know if you\u2019re actually complimenting me or just trying to turn me on,\u201d he said instead.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWell, that\u2019s the thing,\u201d Eddie said. \u201cI\u2019m always trying to turn you on.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Steve laughed. \u201cSo, have you seen that sort of thing a lot? The subspace thing?\u201d The thought made him a little jealous.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNah,\u201d Eddie shrugged.\u201cThat takes, like, trust and shit.\u201d He said it casually, like it was no big deal.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>So Steve had been right. It did mean that they were good together. \u201cWell,\u201d he said, looking at Eddie. \u201cI trust you.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Eddie smiled, putting his hand up to Steve\u2019s face and leaning in slowly. \u201cGood,\u201d he whispered, right before their lips met. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Sometimes Steve went over to Eddie\u2019s place when his uncle was home. They would hang out in the living room, or keep the door to Eddie\u2019s room open, so that Wayne would think they were just normal friends.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>One day, they were listening to music in Eddie\u2019s room, waiting for Wayne to leave for work, and Steve figured Dio was loud enough that their conversation wouldn\u2019t be overheard.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cSo how often do you do it?\u201d Steve asked. \u201cThe whole </span>\n<em>\n<span>cruising </span>\n</em>\n<span>thing?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Eddie said. \u201cNot that often. Just, you know, whenever I get the urge.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Steve had no idea what that meant. It seemed like Eddie got the urge pretty much every day, at least when it came to Steve.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAnd there are places in Hawkins where you can just go pick up random guys for sex?\u201d Steve couldn\u2019t imagine that kind of thing happening in Hawkins, but a few years ago he couldn\u2019t imagine portals to an alternate dimension opening up in Hawkins. Clearly his imagination had its limits.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI mean, yeah, but it\u2019s slim pickings here. Unless you like closeted middle aged dads.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Steve raised his eyebrows. \u201cDo you?\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Eddie tilted his head. \u201cNot generally. There are gay bars in Indianapolis, though.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThat\u2019s kind of far.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYeah, well, that\u2019s actually a good thing. Less likely that anyone from Hawkins will see me.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOh,\u201d Steve said. He hadn\u2019t thought of it that way, but it made sense. \u201cSo you bring guys all the way back here from Indianapolis?\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI\u2019ve been known to.\u201d Eddie shifted uncomfortably. \u201cWhy do we have to talk about me all the time? How often do you pick up women?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThat\u2019s different,\u201d Steve said.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhy, because you\u2019re straight?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cDefinitely not straight, but no, that\u2019s not what I meant.\u201d He wasn\u2019t going out to bars, taking home women he had just met. But it wasn\u2019t like he knew most of them that well. Maybe it wasn\u2019t that different.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIs it because you buy them dinner first?\u201d Eddie asked, eyebrows raised.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYeah, that must be it.\u201d Steve laughed. \u201cHow come you never buy me dinner?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cFuck you, Harrington. I live in a trailer park. You buy me dinner.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOkay.\u201d Steve stood up.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Eddie looked up at him with a bemused smile. \u201cWhere are you going?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cDinner. Get in the car.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>While they were driving to the restaurant, Steve found the source of his anxiety. The reason why the thought of Eddie cruising made him feel weird.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cSo.\u201d He tried to keep his tone casual. \u201cHave you done it since we started?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cDone </span>\n<em>\n<span>what </span>\n</em>\n<span>since we started </span>\n<em>\n<span>what</span>\n</em>\n<span>?\u201d Eddie asked.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHad sex with anyone else. Since we started this.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNo.\u201d Eddie paused. \u201cHave you?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNo.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>They both sat quietly for a bit, then Steve decided he had to say what he was thinking.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cCan we\u2026keep it that way?\u201d He asked. \u201c If that\u2019s okay with you,\u201d he added quickly\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYeah,\u201d Eddie said. \u201cYeah, of course.\u201d He smiled. \u201cI probably wouldn\u2019t have anyway. You\u2019re a lot to handle.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Steve\u2019s eyes lit up, seeing an opportunity.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNo,\u201d Eddie said, interrupting him before he even started. \u201cI\u2019m not saying you have a big dick.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cBut you think I do, though,\u201d Steve insisted.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cEh.\u201d Eddie shrugged. \u201cYou\u2019re alright. I\u2019ve seen bigger.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou should be nicer to the guy who\u2019s about to buy you dinner,\u201d Steve said.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYour dick is the perfect size. Can I order dessert?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Dinner was good. Steve still couldn\u2019t believe how he and Eddie never ran out of things to talk about. It felt like a date. A good one. A better one than Steve had been on in a long time. He almost forgot that it wasn\u2019t. Not really.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Steve wasn\u2019t sure if it was the dinner, or the conversation about exclusivity, or something else entirely, but that night they did something new. He found himself naked on Eddie\u2019s bed with his wrists tied above his head, which was pretty familiar by now, but with Eddie straddling him, tearing open a condom packet with his teeth.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAfraid you\u2019re going to get pregnant?\u201d Steve joked.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNo.\u201d Eddie stared at Steve like he had never heard anything so stupid in his life. Steve was getting used to getting that look from Eddie. \u201cThere are a lot worse things I need to worry about if I don\u2019t use condoms.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cShit.\u201d Steve was an idiot. Of course, as a gay man, Eddie had to be especially careful. Steve knew what was going on in the world. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, that was a stupid thing to say. Obviously I want to use it. It was just a dumb joke. I\u2019m an asshole.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou are,\u201d Eddie agreed. \u201cI\u2019ll punish you later.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou could punish me now.\u201d Steve was very curious about what that would entail.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNah,\u201d Eddie said, leaning over to give Steve a kiss. \u201cI\u2019m gonna be nice to you tonight. Because of the dinner.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cSee, I told you it was different.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou can shut up now, Steve,\u201d Eddie said gently.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Steve did.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The next morning, Steve woke to Eddie shaking his shoulder.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cRise and shine, Harrington. I gotta get going, so unless you want to hang out with my uncle\u2014\"</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNo thanks.\u201d Steve sat up. \u201cWhere are you going?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWheeler\u2019s house.\u201d Eddie picked up his jacket off the floor and put it on.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhy? Can I come? What time is it, anyway?\u201d Steve got out of bed and started looking around for his pants.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cD&amp;D. I guess, if you want to. And it\u2019s eleven. You\u2019re a really late sleeper.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI\u2019m not, usually. You just tire me out.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cGood.\u201d Eddie smirked. \u201cI try. So, are you coming with me?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Steve had located his clothes and was now almost fully dressed. \u201cSure.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Steve had no interest in D&amp;D, but he did want to go, for some reason. He snuck to the bathroom to finish getting ready. He was pleasantly surprised that Eddie had everything he needed to make his hair presentable. He should have guessed that Eddie\u2019s hairstyle took some work.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>When they got to the Wheelers\u2019 house, Dustin answered the door. He was smiling, but frowned when he saw Steve. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWow, nice to see you too, Henderson. Why are you even answering the door? This isn\u2019t your house.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNone of Mike\u2019s family is home. I came up to answer the door for Eddie, who I expected.\u201d He looked at Eddie. \u201cSeriously. Did you bring him, or did he just show up on his own?\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI brought him,\u201d Eddie said with a shrug. \u201cSorry.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhy?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWe were just hanging out and he wanted to come along. I didn\u2019t think you\u2019d mind.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhy were you hanging out first thing in the morning?\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Oh, that was a good question. Maybe Eddie shouldn\u2019t have said that.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWe\u2019re adults, Dustin,\u201d Steve cut in. \u201cWe wake up at a reasonable time.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYeah.\u201d Eddie looked at Steve with a knowing smile. Steve definitely had not woken up at a reasonable time. \u201cWe do all sorts of stuff in the morning.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Dustin narrowed his eyes at them, then let out a heavy sigh. \u201cFine. I guess it doesn\u2019t matter if Steve is here.\u201d He started walking away.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Steve and Eddie exchanged a glance and then followed him, down to the Wheelers\u2019 basement.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>At the table were Mike, Will, and Lucas. They all looked surprised as Steve entered the room, but none of them were as annoyed as Dustin.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhere are, uh\u2026\u201d Steve felt guilty as he realized that he didn\u2019t actually know the names of Eddie\u2019s other friends. \u201cThe rest of the Hellfire boys,\u201d he finished.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cJeff went off to college early so he could take summer classes, and Gareth is on vacation with his family. Eddie didn\u2019t tell you this, since you two are apparently best friends now?\u201d Dustin was clearly jealous that they were hanging out with each other more than him. It was a weird reversal of the previous school year, where Eddie and Steve had been jealous of each other because of the time they were each spending with Dustin.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNo,\u201d Steve said. \u201cIt didn\u2019t come up. Can we tone down the hostility a little bit?\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI just think it\u2019s interesting how you never wanted to play D&amp;D with us before, but now that you\u2019re friends with Eddie you suddenly want to play.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWell </span>\n<em>\n<span>I </span>\n</em>\n<span>think it\u2019s interesting how last summer none of you guys wanted to play with Will because you were </span>\n<em>\n<span>too mature</span>\n</em>\n<span> for D&amp;D, and then as soon as school started, you met Eddie and D&amp;D was cool again.\u201d Steve had been underneath the mall while most of that was happening last summer, but Will had told him about it.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201c</span>\n<em>\n<span>Thank you</span>\n</em>\n<span>,\u201d Will said.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYeah,\u201d Eddie said, looking at Mike, Lucas, and Dustin. \u201cThat actually really sucks, dudes.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cUh, sorry,\u201d Lucas said, looking at Will warily.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYeah, sorry,\u201d Mike added.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Dustin rolled his eyes. \u201cCan we just talk about the game today? Steve doesn\u2019t even know how to play.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI can be on Eddie\u2019s team,\u201d Steve said.\u00a0\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThere are no </span>\n<em>\n<span>teams</span>\n</em>\n<span>, Steve,\u201d Dustin said witheringly. \u201cAnd Eddie\u2019s the Dungeon Master.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAh, right.\u201d Steve thought of the joke he had once made about that, and he glanced at Eddie with a small smile. \u201cI remember now.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Eddie bit his lip. \u201cIt\u2019s fine. I already rolled a character for him.\u201d He pulled out a paper and handed it to Steve.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou made this for me?\u201d When had Eddie had time to do that? \u201cLet me see.\u201d Steve skimmed the paper. \u201cI\u2019m a human fighter. Neutral good. Two-handed weapon proficiency. Oh, I have a lot of weapons. These are my stats? Okay, highest stat is CHR. What\u2019s CHR?\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cCharisma,\u201d Eddie said.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOh.\u201d Steve inclined his head toward Eddie, flattered. \u201cThanks.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThat\u2019s </span>\n<em>\n<span>not</span>\n</em>\n<span> a good stat for a fighter, Steve,\u201d Dustin interrupted.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d Will said. He kept looking from Eddie to Steve, and Steve wondered if he sensed something. \u201cLet\u2019s just play.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Steve was pretty overwhelmed by the rules of the game, not to mention the dorkiness. Eddie did all kinds of weird voices, and was actually a pretty good actor. Steve found himself staring at him a lot. A few times he caught Will watching him watch Eddie, and then he started intentionally avoiding looking at Eddie. He was afraid that might be just as conspicuous, but he wasn\u2019t sure of the exact right amount to look at Eddie so that no one would suspect he was attracted to him.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Steve was also pretty sure that the dice were rigged, somehow. Everyone else rolled a variety of different numbers, but he only rolled shit.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cSorry, Steve, that\u2019s a critical miss.\u201d Eddie shook his head.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHow could I miss him? He\u2019s right in front of me!\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cBecause you rolled a </span>\n<em>\n<span>one</span>\n</em>\n<span>,\u201d Dustin said. \u201cThat\u2019s the worst possible roll you could get.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYeah, I understand how numbers work, Dustin.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou suck.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI get it.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>They took a break at one point, and Steve offered to be the one who went to get snacks from the Wheelers\u2019 kitchen. He asked Eddie to join him, saying he would need help carrying stuff. Will watched them leave.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Once they got to the kitchen, Steve had to tell Eddie the real reason he\u2019d asked him to come with him to the kitchen.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI think Will\u2019s on to us.\u201d Even though none of Mike\u2019s family was home and the boys were in the basement, Steve whispered. \u201cHe kept giving me weird looks.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Eddie shrugged. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s just because you look so good today.\u201d Eddie grabbed the bottom edge of Steve\u2019s shirt and tugged him forward.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Steve rolled his eyes, but still let Eddie pull him in close. \u201cCome on, be serious.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIt\u2019s your fault, you know. You\u2019re the one flirting with me in front of them.\u201d Eddie put his arms around Steve\u2019s waist.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI\u2019m not flirting. I think I would know if I were flirting.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cApparently not. Aren\u2019t you supposed to be suave or something?\u201d He smirked. \u201cAre you just so attracted to me that it makes you into a complete idiot?\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cShhh,\u201d Steve said, pulling away from Eddie. He wasn\u2019t wrong, but now was definitely not a good time for all of that. Steve took a few steps back. \u201cYou\u2019re going to get us in trouble.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Steve heard someone in the doorway, and he was glad he had moved away when he did.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIn trouble?\u201d It was Dustin. He looked at them with narrowed eyes. \u201cIn trouble how?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cUm.\u201d Steve looked around, grasping for an excuse. \u201cI just meant, uh\u2014\"</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWait a minute.\u201d A look of dawning realization came over Dustin\u2019s face, and Steve felt like he was going to throw up. \u201cAre you guys\u2014\" Steve took a deep breath. \u201c</span>\n<em>\n<span>On drugs?\u201d</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Steve and Eddie looked at each other, eyes wide. Steve had been so sure they were about to be found out.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYes,\u201d Steve said, still looking at Eddie. \u201cTotally\u2014 totally stoned.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Eddie spread his arms wide, an apologetic smile on his face. \u201cYou caught us!\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Dustin glared at Steve. \u201cI can\u2019t believe you. Ever since you two started hanging out, you\u2019ve been a terrible influence on him.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Steve\u2019s jaw dropped. \u201cMe?\u201d He looked over at Eddie, who had his fist pressed against his mouth, choking back laughter. \u201cHe\u2019s the one\u2014\" Steve paused. He was pretty sure that Dustin didn\u2019t know about Eddie\u2019s chosen profession, and he wasn\u2019t going to be the one to tell him. \u201cIt was his idea,\u201d he finished.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Eddie raised his eyebrows and shrugged. \u201cSorry,\u201d he said.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Dustin sighed. \u201cI knew you guys were acting weird. Can we just finish the game now?\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYeah, of course,\u201d Steve said. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>They followed Dustin back down to the basement, holding the promised snacks and shooting each other disbelieving looks. It was an incredibly close call.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The rest of the game went relatively smoothly, aside from the occasional glance from Will, which Steve pointedly ignored, and the fact that Steve still had no idea what was going on. He was relieved when his character died, and he could just relax and watch the others play. It was dorky, yeah, but he was still happy to hang out with his friends. Dustin was right, in his way; Eddie and Steve had been spending a lot of time with each other, and hadn\u2019t been making as much time for the rest of their friends.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Steve especially enjoyed watching Eddie interact with the kids. They clearly admired him, especially Mike and Dustin. And Eddie was good with them. Apparently Steve wasn\u2019t the only one who was a damn good babysitter. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHey, Steve!\u201d Robin was on the phone, sounding conspicuously cheerful.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOkay, what do you want?\u201d Steve crossed his arms, balancing the receiver on his shoulder.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWow, once again super happy that your </span>\n<em>\n<span>best friend </span>\n</em>\n<span>is calling.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI can tell you\u2019re calling to ask me for a favor.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou can\u2019t possibly tell that. That\u2019s not something you can just figure out from tone of voice. At least not from just two words.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThen why are you calling?\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Robin was quiet for a moment. \u201cI\u2019m going to lunch with Vickie in two hours, and I need you to come with me.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhat? I\u2019m not coming with you on your date, Robin.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI don\u2019t even think it\u2019s a date. It\u2019s probably not a date.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cShe likes you, right? And you like her. It\u2019s a date.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cBut she didn\u2019t say like, </span>\n<em>\n<span>do you want to go on a date with me? </span>\n</em>\n<span>She just said we should meet for lunch.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Steve rolled his eyes. \u201cRead between the lines, Robin. Why do I have to tell you this? Aren\u2019t you supposed to be the smart one?\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cPlease, Steve. I\u2019m way too nervous to do this on my own. I know I\u2019m not gonna be able to shut up, and she\u2019s gonna think I\u2019m weird.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure she already knows you\u2019re weird, and she still likes you, so\u2026\u201d He trailed off.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cSteve! Come on. What am I even supposed to wear? Like a dress or something? I don\u2019t even own a dress. Should I wear, like, a cool hat? What do I talk about, the news? Like Chernobyl? Or the Challenger explosion?\u201d Robin didn\u2019t pause long enough to catch her breath, let alone allow Steve to process everything she had said.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cA cool hat?\u201d It took him a moment to catch up. \u201cRobin, why are those your examples of news stories to talk about? Don\u2019t talk about people dying horribly on your date!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cSee, this is the problem! This is why I need you to be there.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHow am I supposed to help?\u201d Steve certainly couldn\u2019t stop Robin when she got going like this, so he wasn\u2019t sure what she expected him to do. \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure having me there is just gonna make it worse.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou can bring Eddie.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Steve sighed. \u201cDo you need me to pick you up?\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI can walk! Thank you, Steve! I owe you big time, seriously!\u201d She hung up.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Two hours later, Steve and Eddie pulled up to a local burger joint and got out of the car. Steve saw Robin and Vickie standing out front, and he waved.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOh my god,\u201d Robin said in an excited tone that was, to Steve\u2019s ears at least, total bullshit. \u201cI can\u2019t believe you guys are here. That\u2019s so funny. Vickie, you remember my friends Steve and Eddie?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYeah.\u201d Vickie gave Robin a sidelong glance as she greeted them. \u201cHey, guys.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Eddie waved. Steve just stared at Robin.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou guys should sit with us,\u201d Robin continued.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOh, no, we couldn\u2019t possibly\u2026\u201d Eddie said. His bullshitting was actually a lot more believable than Robin\u2019s.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI insist,\u201d Robin said. She turned to Vickie. \u201cCome on, let\u2019s go get a table.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The girls started inside, and Eddie leaned over to Steve.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIs that how we\u2019re playing this?\u201d He nudged Steve\u2019s shoulder with his own. \u201cYou should have told me, I would have gotten in character ahead of time.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIn character?\u201d Steve raised an eyebrow.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYeah, I would have acted way more surprised to see her. So I could really sell it.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Steve shook his head. \u201cShe didn\u2019t tell me she was going to do that. I assumed she told Vickie we were coming.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNo, of course she didn\u2019t,\u201d Eddie said. \u201cThat would have been much less awkward.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Steve shook his head. \u201cMake something less awkward? Not our Robin.\u201d He sighed. \u201cOkay, let\u2019s get this over with.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>They headed inside, following Robin and Vickie to a table where they were already sitting on one side of the booth. Steve slid in on the other side and Eddie sat next to him.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cSo,\u201d Robin said. \u201cWhat\u2019s up with you guys?\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Steve couldn\u2019t believe that Robin was expecting Eddie and him to lead the conversation on her date. Or, he could believe it, since she had basically said she was going to. He was just annoyed.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cJust getting lunch,\u201d Steve said with a tight smile.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>They all sat in awkward silence for a moment, and Steve was surprised that Vickie was the one to break it.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cUm, I like your pins,\u201d she said to Eddie.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Eddie raised his eyebrows. \u201cYou listen to metal?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYeah,\u201d Vickie said. \u201cI listen to a bit of everything. I just really love music. All kinds. But yeah, Judas Priest and Dio,\u201d she said, pointing at the pins as she mentioned them. \u201cI\u2019m a big fan of both.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cA woman of taste,\u201d Eddie said, smiling. He inclined his head toward Steve. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t listen to metal.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYes I do,\u201d Steve protested. \u201cI listen to it all the time!\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYeah, when I play it for you.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThat counts!\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI can\u2019t picture you listening to metal, Steve.\u201d Of course Robin would chime in now that the topic was making fun of Steve. \u201cBut then again, six months ago I couldn\u2019t picture you hanging out with Eddie.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cImagine my surprise when I found out Steve Harrington wasn\u2019t a douchebag,\u201d Eddie said to Vickie.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI was surprised too, honestly,\u201d Robin added.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOkay, okay,\u201d Steve said. \u201cThat\u2019s enough.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHey, we said you </span>\n<em>\n<span>aren\u2019t </span>\n</em>\n<span>a douchebag,\u201d Robin said. \u201cThat\u2019s a compliment.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYeah,\u201d Eddie said, looking at Steve fondly. \u201cDespite appearances, he\u2019s actually a really good guy.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhy do you guys have to compliment me in a way that sounds like an insult?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhatever,\u201d Eddie said. \u201cI compliment you all the time.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Steve couldn\u2019t argue with that. At least not in front of Robin and Vickie. It was technically true, but Eddie complimented him the most in a very specific context.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cFine,\u201d Steve said. \u201cBut can we talk about literally anything else?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI saw on the news\u2014\u201c Robin began, but Steve shook his head at her, frowning. He remembered the news stories she had mentioned on the phone. Robin saw him, but continued after a pause. \u201cUm, they did an expedition to find the remains of the Titanic. There was a bunch of video of the ship.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Okay, it wasn\u2019t Chernobyl, but it was still bad. Did Robin only pay attention to news stories about tragic disasters? Steve looked at her in disbelief.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The waitress came by then, a gray-haired lady wearing a bright pink dress. \u201cAww, a double date?\u201d She asked as she set down their menus.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>All four of them began protesting at once.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNo, no, we\u2019re all just friends,\u201d Steve said, but he could barely hear himself over the sound of Robin, Vickie and Eddie saying similar things.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOkay, kids,\u201d the waitress said, looking bewildered. \u201cI\u2019ll be right back to get your orders.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>They sat in silence for a moment after she walked away, and Steve waited for his heart rate to return to normal.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWait,\u201d Vickie said. \u201cShe probably didn\u2019t mean\u2014\u201c</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYeah, no,\u201d Robin said. \u201cI think she meant\u2014\u201c she gestured from herself to Steve, who sat across from her, then looked over at Vickie and Eddie.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOkay,\u201d Eddie said. \u201cSo that was\u2026unnecessary.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Vickie laughed. \u201cWe\u2019re so stupid. Now she probably thinks we\u2019re a bunch of freaks.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Eddie shrugged, smiling. \u201cBeing a freak\u2019s not so bad. You\u2019ll get used to it.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Some of the awkward tension seemed to fade between the four of them, even if it increased again briefly when the waitress came back to take their orders. Robin and Vickie couldn\u2019t stop giggling. Steve watched them, happy for Robin. They got along well, and it looked pretty unambiguously like a date to Steve, despite Robin\u2019s earlier uncertainty.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The four of them chatted easily, pausing only when their food arrived. The waitress was still giving them weird looks when she came by, but she was mostly avoiding them except when necessary.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>When Robin got up to use the bathroom, Steve and Eddie were alone with Vickie, which brought back some of the awkwardness. But once Eddie and Vickie started talking about music again, it was okay.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI think Screaming for Vengeance is the best Judas Priest album,\u201d Vickie said. They had been discussing this for a few minutes and Steve had very little input. He had probably listened to a few of the albums they were discussing, but he hadn\u2019t formed any nuanced opinions on them. Eddie was too distracting.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI respect that,\u201d Eddie said. \u201cBut Defenders of the Faith is my favorite,\u201d he added, stealing a French fry off of Steve\u2019s plate.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHey, get your own!\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou can afford it!\u201d Eddie looked at him with puppy dog eyes. \u201cCome on, I\u2019m poor.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI\u2019m not falling for that again.\u201d Steve shook his head, biting back a smile.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYeah, you are.\u201d Eddie took another fry. \u201cYou fall for it every time.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Steve wasn\u2019t sure if the thing he fell for every time was Eddie convincing him to pay for meals or those huge brown eyes. Either way, he was right. Steve pushed the plate toward Eddie. Eddie laughed and continued to eat Steve\u2019s fries.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Steve noticed then that Vickie was watching them, a smile on her face.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhat?\u201d Steve asked.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOkay,\u201d Vickie said. \u201cI get it.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cGet what?\u201d Eddie asked.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI get why Robin invited you.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cInvited?\u201d Eddie shook his head. \u201cNo, we just happened to be here.\u201d Steve was still impressed by how good of an actor Eddie could be when he wanted to. Steve would have believed it himself if he hadn\u2019t known better.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Vickie laughed. \u201cNo, I saw through that right away. Robin\u2019s a terrible liar. I just didn\u2019t understand what she was doing. But now I do.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhat was she doing?\u201d Steve asked.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI\u2019ve been really nervous, you know? About all of this. I didn\u2019t know if I could like a girl. Or, I knew I liked her but I was afraid of what that would mean. I\u2019ve never known anyone like that, and I guess I never thought that it could be\u2026normal. Happy. Nobody ever told me it could be.\u201d She paused. \u201cBut you guys are so happy together. You obviously care about each other a lot, and you\u2019re just a normal, healthy couple. I guess she just wanted me to see that it was possible.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Steve froze. He stared, open-mouthed, at Vickie. He didn\u2019t know what to say.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Next to him, Eddie let out a laugh. \u201cNo,\u201d he said. \u201cNo, we\u2019re just friends. Seriously.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYeah.\u201d Steve forced a smile. \u201cFriends.\u201d It almost hurt to say it. Because Vickie had been so happy. Because he didn\u2019t want to disappoint her. That had to be it, because Steve knew they were just friends. He had been saying it all summer. They had to be.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOh.\u201d Vickie\u2019s eyes widened. She looked suddenly scared. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry, I thought\u2014\u201c</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d Eddie said quickly. \u201cWe\u2019re\u2014 I\u2019m gay.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Steve looked down. He wondered what Eddie had stopped himself from saying. </span>\n<em>\n<span>We\u2019re</span>\n</em>\n<span> what? What were they?\u00a0 \u201cYeah,\u201d he said after a moment. He tried his best to keep the smile in place. \u201cIt\u2019s fine. You don\u2019t have to worry about us. I\u2019ve been listening to Robin talk about how much she likes you for months.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cMonths?\u201d Vickie was smiling again. Steve was happy that he had successfully changed the subject.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYeah, it\u2019s been pretty adorable,\u201d Eddie added.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Robin came back to the table then. \u201cWhat are you guys whispering about?\u201d She sat down, then looked at Steve sitting across from her. \u201cOh my god, Steve, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d she asked, eyes wide.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNothing!\u201d Steve had been pretty sure he was still smiling, but now that he thought about it, it did feel more like a grimace. He dropped the fake smile entirely, trying to make his expression neutral.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIt\u2019s my fault,\u201d Vickie said. \u201cI thought Steve and Eddie were dating.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Robin looked at Steve. \u201cIt\u2019s an easy mistake to make,\u201d she said. \u201cBut </span>\n<em>\n<span>of course</span>\n</em>\n<span> they\u2019re </span>\n<em>\n<span>just friends.</span>\n</em>\n<span>\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The way she said it really annoyed Steve. The way she emphasized the words made it obvious that she didn\u2019t believe what she was saying. She had never really believed it, had she? She had thought Eddie had a crush on him, way back when this all started. But she was totally off base. If Eddie had a crush on him, he wouldn\u2019t have reacted that way when Vickie assumed they were dating. Like the mere idea of it was ridiculous. Steve was a little hurt by that, actually. They weren\u2019t dating, but it wasn\u2019t that crazy to imagine, was it? Did Eddie not think he was dateable?\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>But it didn\u2019t matter if Eddie thought that. Steve had no right to be hurt by it. He tried to push the hurt down into the place in his mind where he used to hide all the things he didn\u2019t want to think about, but it wasn\u2019t working as well these days. It was like once he opened it up, he couldn\u2019t close it again. He wasn\u2019t mad at Eddie. They had been very clear about being just friends, and he probably didn\u2019t mean it as an insult to Steve. Steve was just being oversensitive.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>He was kind of mad at Robin, though, which was why he pulled her aside when the four of them were on their way out of the restaurant.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHey, Robin, can I talk to you real quick?\u201d Steve asked.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYeah, sure.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>They walked away from Vickie and Eddie. Steve glanced over at them. They were talking, and far enough away that hopefully they wouldn\u2019t overhear.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cDid you, like, do this on purpose?\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cDo what on purpose?\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cInvite me and Eddie.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYes?\u201d Robin looked at him with confusion. \u201cI explicitly invited you. Remember when I called you this morning?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYeah. No. That\u2019s not what I meant. Vickie thought you invited us to make her more comfortable by showing that there are healthy gay relationships, or something.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOh, god, no.\u201d Robin laughed. \u201cYou guys don\u2019t have a healthy relationship. You won\u2019t even admit you\u2019re </span>\n<em>\n<span>in</span>\n</em>\n<span> a relationship.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThat\u2019s because we\u2019re not.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Robin gestured forcefully at him. \u201cSee? Denial is not healthy.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cJust because you don\u2019t understand it doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re in denial.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Robin rolled her eyes. \u201cYou care about each other, right?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYeah, of course. We\u2019re friends. I care about you too.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cVery sweet. Beside the point. So, you care about each other and you\u2019re also having, like, tons of sex.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou don\u2019t know how much sex we\u2019re having.\u201d It wasn\u2019t that she was wrong. Steve just didn\u2019t like the point she was trying to make by saying it.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI guess I just assumed because you guys always look like you\u2019re about ten seconds away from ripping each other\u2019s clothes off. I figured you were doing it constantly.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWe do other stuff together.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Robin nodded. \u201cOh yeah? Like watch movies? Eat meals together? Have long talks?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYeah, sure.\u201d They did all of those things.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Robin narrowed her eyes at him. \u201cThat\u2019s dating, Steve. You\u2019re dating.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Steve shook his head. \u201cI do those things with you, too.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYeah, but we don\u2019t have sex after. Seriously, Steve. What fundamental difference is there between a relationship and what you and Eddie are doing?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI\u2014\u201c Did Robin actually have a point here? \u201cIt\u2019s- it\u2019s feelings. The feelings.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAre you really gonna stand here and tell me you don\u2019t have feelings for each other?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Steve thought for a moment. </span>\n<em>\n<span>Was </span>\n</em>\n<span>he going to stand here and tell her that? He was, right? Because it was true, right? He needed it to be true, because otherwise he was in trouble. \u201cYes.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOkay,\u201d Robin said flatly. She pressed her lips into a thin line.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOkay?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYep. Whatever you say, Steve.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhat, you\u2019re just giving up?\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOh, did you want me to keep going?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>He kind of did. \u201cNo, I\u2019m just surprised. You\u2019ve been harping on this all summer.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYeah, and I\u2019m tired of it. If you want to be an idiot about this, that\u2019s your prerogative. If you decide to stop being an idiot, feel free to come talk to me about it. I\u2019m going to say goodbye to Vickie.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Robin walked over to Vickie and Eddie. Steve watched all three of them talk for a moment. Robin hugged both Eddie and Vickie goodbye, though she lingered much longer with Vickie. She and Vickie walked in opposite directions, and Eddie walked toward Steve.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHey, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d Eddie\u2019s face was so earnest, so open, that Steve almost told him. If he only could figure out how to put it into words.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNothing,\u201d he said instead. \u201cI\u2019m just\u2026super tired.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhat were you talking to Robin about?\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI\u2019m just annoyed that she invited us to her date with Vickie and didn\u2019t even tell her. Or tell us that she wasn\u2019t telling her.\u201d That was part of the truth, at least.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIt turned out okay,\u201d Eddie said. \u201cDidn\u2019t you have fun?\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNo.\u201d Steve had been annoyed and awkward at the beginning, then fine in the middle. It could have ended up being fun, but now Steve just felt\u2026something. Confused, mostly.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAlright.\u201d Eddie looked at Steve for a long moment, but he didn\u2019t push him to say any more. \u201cLet\u2019s go, then.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>They didn\u2019t talk much in the car. Eddie tried, but gave up after a few monosyllabic answers from Steve. When they got to the trailer park, Eddie looked out of all the car windows, checking to see if anyone was around. He moved downward, folding himself into the space in front of the passenger seat.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Steve asked.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cCome here,\u201d Eddie said, beckoning to Steve.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Steve bent over hesitantly, and Eddie put his hand on the back of Steve\u2019s head, pulling him into a kiss. Steve was concerned for a moment, but he realized that must have been why Eddie was looking around. And they were below the windows of the car. Nobody would be able to see them unless they had a particularly high-angle view.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Eddie kissed him slowly, gently. It wasn\u2019t a seductive kiss. It was a comforting one. Eddie knew he was upset, and he wanted to make him feel better. Eddie cared about him. He cared about Eddie. Maybe Robin was right. Maybe Steve was an idiot. An idiot with feelings that he really needed to think about.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>They kissed for longer than they probably should have, considering it was broad daylight and they were in public, but at least it made Steve realize something.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>He was definitely an idiot. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>It was almost the end of the summer. Everyone was getting ready for school, whether it was the kids busily preparing for their sophomore year, or the recent graduates preparing to go off to college. Everyone except Steve and Eddie. Steve and Eddie were staying here, doing the same shit they always did.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The only change in routine came when Steve\u2019s parents went away for the weekend. With them out of the house, Steve could finally have Eddie over to his place. They had planned it as soon as Steve knew about his parents leaving. It was perfect. They would have the house to themselves, so they wouldn\u2019t have to worry about anyone catching them.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>But after the not-double-date with Vickie and Robin, Steve felt conflicted. Was it wrong for him to keep doing this when he had feelings for Eddie? He would have talked to Robin about it, but he was still annoyed with her. Mostly for being right. If he had talked to her, he was sure her answer would be that Eddie felt the same way, that Steve should tell him and they would live happily ever after. But it wasn\u2019t that simple. Steve hadn\u2019t even fully processed his feelings, let alone figured out how to talk about them.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>He knew Eddie cared about him. Eddie had shown him that over and over again. Steve had played back every instance of it in his head, starting with when he jumped into the lake after Steve and ending with the kiss in the car. Had it changed at some point? Was there some switch that flipped that changed the way Eddie cared from platonic to romantic? Steve wasn\u2019t sure. He hadn\u2019t even figured out when the switch had flipped for himself. Probably a long time ago. He really was an idiot.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Steve knew he had to figure out a way to talk to Eddie about how he felt. Everything in this relationship had been initiated by Steve in some way. Eddie always waited for Steve to ask, to escalate. He must be waiting for Steve to say it first. He must feel the same way. Probably. Hopefully.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>And having Steve\u2019s house to themselves? It was the perfect time. He was going to do it. He just had to decide how.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>When Eddie arrived at Steve\u2019s house, he looked around, examining everything from the furniture to the wallpaper to the ugly art Steve\u2019s mom had hung up. He pulled a book off the shelf in the living room and started flipping through it.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThat\u2019s not mine,\u201d Steve said. If Eddie was trying to get some sort of evidence about what Steve liked, the living room was not the place to do it.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI know,\u201d Eddie said, as though it were the most obvious thing in the world. \u201cCan you even read, Harrington?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWow,\u201d Steve said. \u201cInsult the guy who invited you into his home, the guy who\u2019s </span>\n<em>\n<span>cooking you dinner</span>\n</em>\n<span>\u2014\u201c</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou\u2019re cooking?\u201d He sounded shocked and intrigued. \u201cHuh. Playing house with Steve Harrington. I never could have imagined. Where\u2019s your frilly apron?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI could probably dig one up, honestly.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Eddie tilted his head. \u201cOnly if you\u2019re not wearing anything under it.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWell, it would be my mom\u2019s, so\u2026\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Eddie wrinkled his nose. \u201cYeah, that would be a bridge too far, even for me. Way to kill the mood.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI didn\u2019t even realize there </span>\n<em>\n<span>was </span>\n</em>\n<span>a mood. You just walked in the door.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou always put me in a mood, Harrington.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t sound like a good thing when you put it that way.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWell\u2026\u201d Eddie shrugged, a teasing smile on his face. \u201cIt isn\u2019t always.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAgain with the insults! Get out of my house, Munson.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNo, no.\u201d Eddie rushed forward, wrapping his arms around Steve in an exaggerated bear hug. \u201cThank you for having me, Steve. I\u2019m sure you can read and that your mom\u2019s apron is extremely sexy.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThank you,\u201d Steve said sarcastically. \u201cThat\u2019s exactly what I needed to hear.\u201d He extricated himself from Eddie\u2019s grip before continuing. \u201cNow please never mention my mom in relation to anything sexual ever again.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI\u2019ve never actually seen your parents. But if your dad looks anything like you, I think he would be the one I would go for.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI thought you weren\u2019t into middle-aged dads.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI\u2019m not, but I\u2019m </span>\n<em>\n<span>really </span>\n</em>\n<span>into making you uncomfortable.\u201d He grinned. \u201cNot into it in a sexual way. It\u2019s just hilarious.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWell, I\u2019m glad one of us finds it funny.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure you like it too. Otherwise you wouldn\u2019t keep me around.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou have other good qualities.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYeah? Like what?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Steve considered. Was this a good moment? Should he just start listing all the things he liked about Eddie? Maybe if he did that, he could figure out what to say. But they had been joking around. He couldn\u2019t just get super serious all of the sudden.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI\u2019ll tell you later,\u201d Steve said, trying to keep the playful tone.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Eddie sighed dramatically. \u201cYou men only care about one thing.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Steve laughed. \u201cYeah, you\u2019re definitely good at that. But it\u2019s not the only reason I keep you around.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThere\u2019s also my sparkling personality.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cExactly.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAnyway, my point was, I had no idea you could cook. Very domestic of you.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cDon\u2019t get your hopes up too high. I can only kind of cook.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Eddie tilted his head toward the kitchen. \u201cSmells pretty good.\u201d He smiled gently at Steve. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to be so nervous about it. You know I\u2019ll eat anything.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>That wasn\u2019t why Steve was nervous, but he wasn\u2019t surprised that Eddie had picked up on it. He always seemed to know how Steve was feeling. Maybe he knew about Steve\u2019s feelings for him, too. That would make it easier. Then Steve wouldn\u2019t have to say anything.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cUh, yeah,\u201d Steve said. \u201cYou can go sit down. I\u2019ll bring it out. The dining room is this way.\u201d He started walking, and Eddie followed.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWow, the </span>\n<em>\n<span>dining room</span>\n</em>\n<span>,\u201d Eddie said. \u201cFancy.\u201d He looked over the table, which Steve had already set, and smirked. \u201cWhat, no candles?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI didn\u2019t realize you were such a romantic.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI\u2019m not. Or, I don\u2019t know if I am. No one has ever romanced me before.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThat\u2019s too bad,\u201d Steve said. His heart was racing. He had butterflies in his stomach. This was a chance. \u201cI\u2019ll get candles.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Eddie bit his lip, smiling. \u201cWhat if I\u2019m not a romantic?\u201d he called after Steve, who was walking out of the dining room.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Steve found candlesticks and long candles in a kitchen cabinet, and brought them out to the dining room. \u201cI guess we\u2019ll just have to find out.\u201d He put the candlesticks in the center of the table.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Eddie shrugged one shoulder. \u201cOkay.\u201d He took out his lighter.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Steve watched Eddie light the candles, remembering when he had smoked with Eddie at that party. He had felt something when Eddie had lit his cigarette. Was that where it had all started?\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNo,\u201d Eddie said. \u201cThat\u2019s not doing anything for me. I think there\u2019s too much light in here.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Steve turned off the lights. It was now dark except for the two small flames. He could barely see Eddie\u2019s face.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNow it\u2019s too dark.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOkay, Goldilocks. Hold your horses.\u201d Steve turned the lights back on, then slowly turned the dimmer knob.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOkay,\u201d Eddie said, once they had the perfect soft glow. Steve watched the candlelight flicker across Eddie\u2019s face. Eddie rolled his eyes, but he was smiling. \u201cYeah, that\u2019s pretty fucking romantic.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Steve hid his smile as he walked back into the kitchen. Eddie might have suggested the candles as a joke, but he wouldn\u2019t have said that as a joke, right? Maybe if Steve just dropped enough hints, Eddie would bring it up. That would make things a lot easier.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Steve brought out the food and they started eating. It wasn\u2019t bad. Eddie insisted that it was great.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cSeriously, Steve. You didn\u2019t have to cook for me. That\u2019s\u2026\u201d he paused. \u201cToo nice.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI wanted to do something nice for you.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou do nice stuff for me all the time.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cI\u2019m not used to that.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Steve shrugged. \u201cMaybe you should get used to it.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI probably shouldn\u2019t. It\u2019ll be too hard to go back to normal once you stop.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWell, I\u2019m not planning on stopping anytime soon.\u201d He kept his tone light. He was just hinting. That was the new plan.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Steve felt like they were pretty strong hints, but Eddie didn\u2019t bring it up during dinner. He had to be picking up on it. Eddie wasn\u2019t stupid. Maybe he knew exactly what Steve meant, but he just didn\u2019t feel the same way. Or maybe he was just enjoying watching Steve sweat. It would be a lot easier if Steve knew how to phrase it. Then he could just say it and get it over with. However Eddie responded, at least he would know.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>After dinner, they watched a movie. Steve didn\u2019t pay any attention to it, because he was nervous, but also because it was the first time they had ever sat on a couch together without the fear of someone walking in. It was a small thing, but it felt big, the way they settled so easily next to each other, legs pressed together and Eddie\u2019s arm around Steve\u2019s shoulder. It felt so natural, like they did this every day. Steve wanted to do it every day.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Partway through the movie, Steve, having absorbed none of the plot, put his hand on Eddie\u2019s thigh. Eddie leaned in to kiss Steve, and all pretense of watching the movie was quickly abandoned. Steve tried to ignore the sounds of an action sequence as they kissed. He shifted to face Eddie, who put one hand flat on Steve\u2019s chest. After a few moments of gentle kissing, Eddie grabbed a handful of Steve\u2019s shirt and moved forward, throwing one leg over Steve\u2019s lap to straddle him. The movie was gone. Steve could only hear the sounds of his own heartbeat and of Eddie\u2019s breath as he nibbled on Steve\u2019s earlobe and trailed biting, sucking kisses down his neck. Soon, the friction of Eddie rubbing against him wasn\u2019t enough for either of them, and he felt Eddie\u2019s hands fumbling with the button of his jeans.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Eddie undid Steve\u2019s pants, and Steve almost didn\u2019t stop him there. \u201cWait, wait,\u201d Steve said reluctantly. He caught his breath before continuing. \u201cAs much of a fuck-you it would be to my parents to have gay sex on their couch, we should go to my bedroom.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Eddie stood, still facing Steve. He looked and sounded much more composed than Steve felt. \u201cI told you, you don\u2019t have to say </span>\n<em>\n<span>gay</span>\n</em>\n<span> sex. It\u2019s implied.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIt was relevant that time.\u201d Steve buttoned his jeans again before standing up. He turned off the movie.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAlright, lead the way,\u201d Eddie said.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou\u2019ve been to my bedroom before. Did you forget?\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cRight, when you were too drunk to walk on your own.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Steve shrugged one shoulder and smiled. \u201cI could have walked fine,\u201d he admitted.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Eddie\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cHarrington, you little slut.\u201d He shook his head, smirking. \u201cI can\u2019t believe you manipulated me like that.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhat are you gonna do about it?\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Eddie stared at him for a moment, eyes narrowed. Steve took off toward his room at a run. Eddie caught up with him next to the bed and kissed him hard, pushing him down onto the bed at the same time. Their teeth crashed together, and Steve gasped against Eddie\u2019s mouth.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou okay?\u201d Eddie asked.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Steve nodded. He put his hand on the back of Eddie\u2019s head and pulled it down, pressing their lips together again.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>They kissed feverishly, breaking apart only to peel away the layers of their clothing.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhere do you keep your condoms?\u201d Eddie asked, sitting up. He sat on Steve\u2019s thighs, keeping him pinned to the bed.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cTop drawer,\u201d Steve said, gesturing toward his nightstand. He looked up at Eddie, who was leaning over to retrieve a condom and lube from the drawer. \u201cHey, you know,\u201d Steve said. \u201cI think this is the first time we\u2019ve done this without my hands tied.\u201d They had done plenty of other stuff without bondage being involved, but not this. \u201cI could\u2026\u201d He raised his eyebrows.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Eddie looked down at him skeptically. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to finger me, Steve. It\u2019s not my first time.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYeah, I\u2019m well aware. Also not really sure why you think that makes foreplay unnecessary.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cDo you really want to?\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>He did, but he also didn\u2019t want Eddie to do it just because of that. \u201cWhy is it always about what I want?\u201d Eddie always focused on Steve, always asked Steve what he was in the mood for. \u201cDo you want me to? Would you like it?\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Eddie looked away, licking his lips, then he looked back at Steve. \u201cYeah. Sure.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYeah? You don\u2019t sound that enthusiastic about it.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhat do you want me to do, jump up and down? Yeah, I want it.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOkay. Why don\u2019t you lay down?\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Eddie tilted his head, looking thoughtful.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to, but\u2013\u201d He shrugged. \u201cYou always take care of me, Eddie. Maybe you can let me take care of you sometimes.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Eddie looked at Steve intensely for a moment, then nodded slowly. One side of his mouth turned up in a smile. \u201cOkay.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Eddie lay down as Steve sat up. Steve looked down at Eddie, whose eyes were round, face open and trusting. He wanted to prove he was worthy of that trust. He wanted to make Eddie feel good, to feel cared for. He wanted to make him feel loved.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>As Steve looked into those eyes full of trust and affection and all the things he had known were there for such a long time, he found the words. He was an idiot for not realizing it sooner. He was in love.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Steve leaned forward, kissing Eddie tenderly for a moment, then moving to trail kisses down his neck, his shoulders, all the way to his fingertips. Eddie watched with a fond but bemused expression.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Steve moved to Eddie\u2019s chest, caressing him as he kissed down his body. When he got to Eddie\u2019s legs, which were bent at the knee, he lifted one to kiss the inner thigh. Eddie made a small noise and twisted away from him slightly.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Steve was worried at first, then he realized. \u201cAre you ticklish?\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Eddie shook his head, eyes wide. \u201cNo.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Steve brushed his fingers gently along Eddie\u2019s inner thigh. Eddie kicked his leg, pulling it out of Steve\u2019s grasp.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou are!\u201d Steve grinned.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI </span>\n<em>\n<span>will</span>\n</em>\n<span> kill you, Harrington.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAlright, alright, no need for death threats.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cFine, but you\u2019re on thin ice,\u201d Eddie said with a small smile. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you just get to the point already?\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOkay, I guess you\u2019re </span>\n<em>\n<span>not</span>\n</em>\n<span> a romantic.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI thought maybe I was, until just then.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Steve laughed. He locked eyes with Eddie for a moment, finding the same trusting expression from earlier. He spread Eddie\u2019s legs, pushing his bent knees back further. He grabbed the lube and looked at Eddie, who nodded. Keeping his eyes on Eddie\u2019s face, he pressed slick fingers into him.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Eddie exhaled lightly, eyes closing. Steve watched Eddie as he slowly began to move, looking for signs of what was good, how Eddie was feeling.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Eddie opened his eyes again to find Steve watching him. He smiled. \u201cWhat are you staring at?\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou,\u201d Steve said. \u201cYou\u2019re so\u2026\u201d Eddie\u2019s cheeks were flushed and he was breathing hard. Steve looked at his eyes, his lips, his chest rising and falling more quickly as Steve kept going. \u201cYou\u2019re gorgeous.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Eddie didn\u2019t reply. He just shook his head a little, biting his lip. Soon his eyes closed again, his brow furrowing. Steve went a little faster, and Eddie inhaled sharply, his mouth falling open.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Steve paused. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d\u00a0\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYeah, it\u2019s\u2013\u201d Eddie said breathlessly. \u201cThat was a good sound.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOkay.\u201d He started moving his fingers again, resuming the quicker pace. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to hold that back. No one\u2019s around to hear us.\u201d Eddie rarely made more than the softest noises, so that gasp had been unusual for him. Steve liked it. He liked seeing Eddie lose some of his usual composure; not just because it was incredibly hot, but also because Eddie was letting himself be vulnerable with Steve in a way he hadn\u2019t before. In a literal, physical sense, but also in an emotional sense. That was the more important part.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Eddie\u2019s breath was ragged, and he let out a quiet whimper. After a while, he spoke, still breathless. \u201cStop, stop.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Steve stopped. \u201cSorry, are you\u2013\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYeah, just, that\u2019s enough.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Steve pulled his fingers out slowly. Eddie took a moment to catch his breath and then pounced, pushing Steve onto his back and kissing him roughly. He ripped open the condom he had retrieved earlier.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThis okay?\u201d Eddie asked.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYeah,\u201d Steve said. \u201cOf course.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Eddie rolled the condom onto Steve\u2019s cock, then sank slowly down onto it. Watching him do that intensified the sensation somehow, and Steve was overwhelmed for a moment. When he found himself again, he sat up to wrap his arms around Eddie. Eddie put his mouth to Steve\u2019s neck and Steve moaned, thrusting up into him.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>It wasn\u2019t long before they found a rhythm, moving together. They knew each other\u2019s bodies so well at this point that Steve felt like they were perfectly in sync.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Steve ran his hands down Eddie\u2019s body, feeling smooth skin and hard muscle. He shuddered as Eddie dug his fingers into his back. They kissed, and Eddie captured Steve\u2019s lower lip between his teeth. Steve thrust harder into Eddie and Eddie moaned softly. When Steve felt himself getting close, he slid his hand between their bodies to wrap around Eddie\u2019s cock, stroking along with the pace they had set. Their movements got rougher and more inconsistent as they got closer to the edge until finally they came, together, Eddie murmuring Steve\u2019s name against his neck.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>They sat there for a while longer, still holding each other tightly, then Eddie moved off of Steve, pulling him gently down onto the bed. Eddie put a hand to Steve\u2019s face and kissed him tenderly. Steve almost said it, almost said </span>\n<em>\n<span>I love you </span>\n</em>\n<span>right then, but he thought better of it. It would seem insincere, right after sex. He didn\u2019t want Eddie to think he\u2019d only said it because of that. He definitely didn\u2019t only feel it because of that.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>They cleaned up and fell into each other\u2019s arms again. As Steve drifted off to sleep, Eddie holding him close, he decided he would say it tomorrow. First thing in the morning, he would tell Eddie that he loved him.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>When Steve woke up, he didn\u2019t open his eyes right away, letting thoughts of the previous night wash over him. He almost didn\u2019t want to get up, so he could live in that memory a little longer.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>But he had to do it today. He had to tell him. He couldn\u2019t waste any more time. He turned onto his side, facing Eddie. He would open his eyes, look into Eddie\u2019s, and say it. </span>\n<em>\n<span>I love you</span>\n</em>\n<span>. He was a little nervous, but last night had made him confident, both in his own feelings and in Eddie\u2019s. Steve opened his eyes.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The bed was empty.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Steve blinked a few times. He tried not to panic. Maybe Eddie was in the bathroom. He stood up, walked down the hall. The bathroom was empty.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cEddie?\u201d He called. No answer. He went down the stairs and walked around aimlessly until something caught his eye in the kitchen.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>A piece of paper on the kitchen counter. It has been pulled off of a notepad Steve\u2019s mom kept stuck to the fridge. </span>\n<em>\n<span>The Harringtons</span>\n</em>\n<span> was printed on the top in block letters.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>A note, in Eddie\u2019s handwriting. </span>\n<em>\n<span>Sorry I had to run. Thanks for dinner, etc. </span>\n</em>\n<span>The bottom of the page had been torn off, but Steve could see pen marks, the tops of letters. What had Eddie written there? Why had he changed his mind about it? Steve understood why Eddie had to keep the note vague. Anything in writing might be seen by the wrong person. But he could have just woken Steve up to say goodbye.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Steve dialed the phone. \u201cHey, Robin. Can you talk?\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYeah,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m home alone. What\u2019s up?\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIn that case, can I come over?\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cSteve, are you okay?\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYeah, yeah,\u201d Steve said quickly. \u201cI just need to talk. About Eddie.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201c</span>\n<em>\n<span>Oh. </span>\n</em>\n<span>Yeah, of course.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Steve threw on some clothes and drove to Robin\u2019s house. She had said she was home alone, so when he got there he tried the door. It was unlocked, and he opened it to find Robin sitting on the couch in the living room, waiting for him.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHey.\u201d He sat next to her on the couch.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cSo, what\u2019s going on?\u201d She asked. She seemed excited. \u201cWhat\u2019s up with Eddie?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWe were together last night,\u201d Steve said.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYeah, I could tell. You have, like, </span>\n<em>\n<span>a lot </span>\n</em>\n<span>of hickies.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Steve rubbed his neck. \u201cYou should see the other guy.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Robin rolled her eyes. \u201cGross. But I assume if you\u2019re here to talk about him, you\u2019ve probably decided to be less of an idiot, so let\u2019s talk about that.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cLast night was\u2026intense.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIntense?\u201d Robin leaned forward, her eyes wide. \u201cIntense how?\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWell, I mean, sexually.\u201d Robin wrinkled her nose at that. \u201cBut not just that. We talked about romance and stuff? I felt like we were kind of talking around something that we both knew was there. And he was just really, I don\u2019t know, vulnerable with me? Emotionally,\u201d he clarified quickly. He didn\u2019t want Robin to start picturing things again.\u00a0\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOh my god,\u201d Robin said. \u201cWow. That\u2019s\u2026wow.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cBut, when I woke up this morning, he was just gone.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Robin\u2019s eyes got somehow wider. \u201cHe slept over?\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYeah.\u201d Steve shrugged one shoulder. \u201cWe always sleep over.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Robin\u2019s eyes were now the size of dinner plates, and her eyebrows were threatening to take off into orbit. \u201cYou </span>\n<em>\n<span>always </span>\n</em>\n<span>sleep over? Oh my god, Steve, you are </span>\n<em>\n<span>in a relationship.</span>\n</em>\n<span> Do you always cuddle too?\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>They did, actually, but that wasn\u2019t the point right now. \u201cWe\u2019re not in a relationship, Robin.\u201d He paused, unsure of what to say. \u201cBut I feel like I\u2026want to be?\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYes!\u201d Robin actually clapped her hands. \u201cOh my god, that\u2019s amazing. Wait, wait. You wanna </span>\n<em>\n<span>go steady</span>\n</em>\n<span> with him? Get it? Because, like, Steve plus Eddie.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Steve just stared at her.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou don\u2019t get it. It\u2019s like, if you </span>\n<em>\n<span>combine your names\u2013\u201d</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI get it, Robin! It\u2019s just really stupid.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIt\u2019s hilarious, but whatever.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI just\u2026I thought things were going really well. I wanted to finally talk to him about it. Why did he leave?\u201d That was the only thing that made him doubt how Eddie felt.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cDid you ask him?\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNo.\u201d Steve shrugged. \u201cI mean, he left a note but it just said he had to go.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Robin threw her hands up. \u201cAnd you called me before you called him? Steve, what\u2019s wrong with you? Why are you incapable of calling the person you need to talk to?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI don\u2019t know! I got scared. I needed advice. I don\u2019t know if he feels the same way.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHe definitely does. Based on what you told me, and what </span>\n<em>\n<span>he\u2019s </span>\n</em>\n<span>told me\u2014\u201c\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhat did he tell you?\u201d Steve didn\u2019t know Eddie and Robin had talked about it.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNot a lot, but I can read between the lines.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cRobin, what did he say?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI asked him if things were going well with you, and he gave me some joke answer, but Steve. His face.\u201d Her own expression softened as she said it. \u201cI don\u2019t even know how to describe it. I\u2019ve never seen Eddie look so happy. I\u2019m not sure I\u2019ve seen </span>\n<em>\n<span>anyone</span>\n</em>\n<span> look so happy. And he looks at you like that all the time.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Steve thought about it for a moment. He could picture exactly what Robin was talking about. Eddie\u2019s big brown eyes, full of so much trust and affection. He had to feel the same way.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d Steve said. At least, he hoped she was right.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOf course I\u2019m right. I\u2019ve been right this whole time. Call him.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI will.\u201d Steve stood up.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cActually, I don\u2019t trust you. Call him here.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Steve shook his head. \u201cYou just want to eavesdrop.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou\u2019re not going to tell him how you feel over the phone. Just call him and ask him to go back to your house.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Steve sighed, but he walked to the phone. Robin watched him.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>When Eddie answered, Steve felt a jolt of anxiety in his stomach.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHey, Eddie. It\u2019s me. Um, it\u2019s Steve.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOh, hey, Steve.\u201d Eddie sounded calm, casual. \u201cSorry for running out on you. I had to meet some people. You know, work-related.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOkay.\u201d Steve knew that drug dealers didn\u2019t exactly keep regular working hours, but if Eddie knew he was supposed to meet someone in the morning, why didn\u2019t he mention it last night? \u201cUh, are you free now?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Eddie was quiet for a moment. \u201cYeah, what\u2019s up?\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cCan you come back? To my place? I wanted to talk to you about something.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou can\u2019t talk about it over the phone?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cUh, no. Not really.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOkay. Yeah. I\u2019ll come by.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAlright. See you soon.\u201d Steve hung up the phone.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Robin put her hands up. \u201cYou didn\u2019t even say goodbye?\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI said see you soon!\u201d Steve replayed the conversation in his head. \u201cHe didn\u2019t sound that happy about coming over again.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou didn\u2019t sound that happy either. Maybe he thinks you need to talk about something bad.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cGreat.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter!\u201d Robin grabbed Steve\u2019s shoulders and started pushing him toward the door. \u201cGet out of here! Go get your man!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Steve was nervous when Eddie arrived. After last night, and after talking to Robin, he was pretty sure that Eddie felt the same way he did. But he was still scared. The only person he had felt this strongly about before was Nancy, and that was different. He had just asked her out at school. This whole thing with Eddie had started in such a weird way, and he knew dating a guy would be very different from dating a girl. Steve wasn\u2019t sure what the best approach was.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Eddie was his normal self. Calm, cocky, completely disregarding the concept of personal space.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhat did you want to talk about, Harrington?\u201d He asked, leaning in close enough to kiss Steve. Steve wished he would, but he knew the conversation would be completely derailed if he did. There would be time for that after.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cSo, we\u2019ve been doing this for a while,\u201d Steve started. \u201cThis casual thing. And it\u2019s been good. Really good.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cBut?\u201d Eddie was half-smiling. Steve wondered if he knew what was coming. If he did, and he was smiling, that was a good thing, right?</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cBut it doesn\u2019t\u2014 I don\u2019t feel casual about it anymore.\u201d Steve looked into Eddie\u2019s eyes, trying to figure out what he might be thinking as Steve spoke. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I ever really did, not completely. But now I feel\u2026 serious. Really serious. About you.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhat are you talking about, Steve?\u201d Eddie looked away, licking his lips.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Steve\u2019s heart sank. Eddie didn\u2019t sound happy. Steve had really thought this was going to go well. \u201cI\u2019m saying I have feelings for you.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cFeelings?\u201d Eddie said it with what sounded almost like a laugh, but he didn\u2019t look like he was laughing. \u201cMan, I can\u2019t do shit with that.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Steve felt like he had been punched. \u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Eddie took a step back and turned away from Steve. \u201cI can\u2019t do shit with your feelings, Steve! I can\u2019t\u2014 I can\u2019t deal with that!\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhat?\u201d This wasn\u2019t how Steve had pictured this. He had been so </span>\n<em>\n<span>sure. </span>\n</em>\n<span>\u201cI thought\u2014 I kind of thought you felt the same way.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOf course I do. You\u2019re Steve fucking Harrington, everyone is in love with you.\u201d He didn\u2019t look at Steve when he said it.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAre you being sarcastic?\u201d Steve asked weakly. It would be a really shitty thing to be sarcastic about it, but if he was serious, why did he sound so angry?\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI wish.\u201d Eddie fidgeted with his rings, avoiding Steve\u2019s gaze. \u201cFuck.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d So Eddie had feelings for him. Maybe was even in love with him. But he was upset that Steve felt the same way? \u201cWhat\u2019s the problem?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cMe.\u201d Eddie gestured at himself with both hands. \u201cI\u2019m the problem!\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou\u2019re- you\u2019re not a problem, Eddie.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYes, I am.\u201d He pressed the heels of his hands to his eyes and then looked at Steve again. \u201cThis is my fault. I guess I was having too much fun playing at being in a relationship.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI\u2019m not playing, Eddie. I want to be in an actual relationship with you.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNo.\u201d Eddie shook his head. \u201cI should never have let it go this far. This whole thing was a mistake.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhat, is that why you left last night? It got too real for you?\u201d Steve hadn\u2019t really believed Eddie\u2019s excuse, but he had given him the benefit of the doubt. Had Eddie just been messing around, the whole time? It really hadn't felt like it.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t supposed to go like this.\u201d Eddie sounded frantic. \u201cYou weren\u2019t supposed to have feelings for me, Steve. You were supposed to fuck around for a while, get it out of your system. Then you\u2019d go find some girl, get married, have kids, have a normal life.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI don\u2019t want that. I want to be with you.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cSteve. You don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about. You don\u2019t know what that life would be like. Do you really want to hide that from everyone? What if your parents found out?\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cFuck my parents,\u201d Steve said. \u201cI don\u2019t even want to talk to them once I move out. None of that matters.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Steve knew what Eddie was saying. Obviously they wouldn\u2019t be able to be open about their relationship, but Steve had no illusions about that. They would tell Robin, maybe a few other friends, people they trusted. To everyone else, they\u2019d just be\u2026close friends. Maybe roommates. They could get a two-bedroom apartment; nobody would ask questions.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cSteve, don\u2019t do this,\u201d he said firmly. \u201cJust don\u2019t. You can\u2019t throw your life away like that. Not for me.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Steve\u2019s mouth opened, but he couldn\u2019t find any words that made sense. \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d he finally got out.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThis isn\u2019t\u2014 I can\u2019t do this, Steve. We can\u2019t do this.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhy not?\u201d Steve didn\u2019t get it. If he felt the same way, why was he so adamant that they couldn\u2019t be together?</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Eddie rubbed the back of his neck. \u201cDo you remember when you asked me if I\u2019ve ever been in love?\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYeah,\u201d Steve said. He had been pretty drunk at the time, but he hadn\u2019t forgotten that conversation.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhen you asked me that\u2026\u201d Eddie pushed his hand into his hair, resting his palm on his forehead. \u201cI had never even considered that. It was never on the table. I knew it would never happen.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhat? Why?\u201d Steve found that hard to believe. Yeah, it would be hard growing up gay in Hawkins, but Eddie could have met someone here. Or he could have moved somewhere better, somewhere gay people didn\u2019t have to hide. Or, at the very least, he could have </span>\n<em>\n<span>imagined </span>\n</em>\n<span>doing those things.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIt\u2019s just not for people like me.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Steve furrowed his brow, confused. \u201cLots of gay people are in love, Eddie. There are gay people out there saying they want to get married.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou don\u2019t get it. I\u2019m not talking about that. I\u2019m\u2013\u201d Eddie\u2019s eyes darted around, looking everywhere except at Steve. \u201cI\u2019m damaged goods, Steve. I can\u2019t let you do this. It\u2019s not worth it.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou\u2019re not </span>\n<em>\n<span>damaged goods</span>\n</em>\n<span>.\u201d What did that even mean? \u201cJesus, Eddie.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Eddie leaned his head back, biting his lips. He closed his eyes for a second, took a deep breath, then opened them. \u201cYou know why I live with my uncle?\u201d Eddie waited a moment, staring intensely at Steve.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Did he want an answer to that? Steve shook his head, almost imperceptibly.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cMy parents figured out that I was gay in middle school,\u201d Eddie said.\u00a0 \u201cI was just a kid. I wasn\u2019t even\u2013 I don\u2019t know. There were enough clues and I wasn\u2019t a good liar.\u201d He looked down for a second, took another deep breath and looked at Steve again. \u201cIt\u2019s not like they were ever great parents. Yeah, my dad hit me before then. But not like this. He beat the shit out of me </span>\n<em>\n<span>so bad</span>\n</em>\n<span>\u2014\u201c Eddie stabbed the air with his hand for emphasis. \u201cThat the state took me away from him. Do you know how bad it has to be for them to do that?\u201d Eddie didn\u2019t look sad, or angry. He just looked tired. \u201cI cannot emphasize enough how much the state of Indiana </span>\n<em>\n<span>does not give a shit </span>\n</em>\n<span>about abused gay kids, Steve. He really fucked me up. I could have died.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cEddie\u2026\u201d Steve reached out, trying to take his hand, but Eddie pulled it away. Steve wanted to cry, or maybe scream. He couldn\u2019t believe Eddie wasn\u2019t crying and screaming now, or all the time, to have gone through that. Steve knew a lot of shitty dads, including his own, but this was different. How could someone do that to their own kid?\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHe broke\u2026a lot of stuff.\u201d Eddie put a hand to his face. \u201cMy jaw was wired shut for like three months. I missed so much school I had to repeat the year. And the whole time I was just waiting on the judge to decide whether my parents should have to take me back. God knows they didn\u2019t want me.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>It was horrible. It was the worst thing Steve had ever heard. But he still didn\u2019t understand what it had to do with Steve\u2019s feelings for Eddie.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cSo my uncle took me. I don\u2019t even know why. We\u2019ve never talked about it. None of it.\u201d Eddie\u2019s eyes looked hollow. \u201cAnd then in high school, I\u2013 I\u2019ve done a lot of things I\u2019m not proud of. You wouldn\u2019t be, either. You wouldn\u2019t be doing this right now if you knew all of it.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cEddie, that\u2019s\u2014\u201c</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Eddie cut him off. \u201cIt\u2019s shit, Steve. Is that really what you want? My life is shit. I\u2019m shit.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Steve felt transported back to the night that Nancy had proclaimed everything bullshit, the night he knew their relationship was over. That\u2019s what Eddie was doing. He was ending things. But it was different from when Nancy had done it. It was wrong. Eddie wasn\u2019t ending it because of how he felt about Steve, he was ending it because of how he felt about himself.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cEddie. You\u2019re not shit. You don\u2019t deserve any of that.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWell, it\u2019s what I\u2019ve got. So you should go find something else. </span>\n<em>\n<span>Please</span>\n</em>\n<span>.\u201d He said the last word with a desperation that Steve had never heard from him before. He stared at Steve for a moment and then started toward the door.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cEddie!\u201d Steve felt himself getting louder, which he knew wouldn\u2019t help, but he couldn\u2019t stop. He felt like he was trying to be heard from across a crowded room, like if he could just get Eddie to </span>\n<em>\n<span>hear him</span>\n</em>\n<span>, he could get through to him. He could make it okay. \u201cWill you just listen to me for a second?\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Eddie reached the door, but he turned back, his hand still on the knob. Steve felt a burst of hope.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cDon\u2019t call me, okay?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Steve\u2019s heart sank again. \u201cWhat, like, ever?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI don\u2019t know, man.\u201d Steve couldn\u2019t see Eddie\u2019s face, but he heard his voice start to break. \u201cMaybe.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Steve didn\u2019t know what to do after Eddie left. He just went to his room, put on his Black Sabbath tape, and cried.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Steve had never been much of a crier. It didn\u2019t come easily. Each sob was physically painful, tearing through his chest. By the time the tape was over, he felt numb and exhausted. He couldn\u2019t cry anymore. His body couldn\u2019t handle it.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>He went downstairs to the kitchen. Eddie\u2019s note was still on the counter. Steve stared at it for a moment, trying to figure out what Eddie had written at the bottom and then torn off. Maybe it didn\u2019t matter. Maybe it was just his name. Steve wished, if it had been his name, that he had left it there. Then at least Steve would have that. Now he had nothing. He crumpled up the paper and threw it away.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>He picked up the phone, listened to the dial tone for a long moment, then called Robin.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHey,\u201d he said when she answered.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cSteve? What\u2019s going on?\u201d She must have heard in his voice that something was wrong. Or maybe she was just surprised to hear from him so soon.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou were wrong.\u201d That wasn\u2019t fair. This wasn\u2019t Robin\u2019s fault. \u201cWe were both wrong.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhat do you mean? He doesn\u2019t\u2026\u201d she trailed off.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHe dumped me. Or, I guess,\u201d Steve said with a laugh that was completely devoid of humor. \u201cI guess he didn\u2019t dump me, because we were never actually together.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cMe neither.\u201d Steve couldn\u2019t talk anymore. He hung up the phone.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>After a few seconds, the phone started ringing. Steve unplugged it.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Steve didn\u2019t talk to anyone for a couple of days. He just sat in his room, feeling numb. He didn\u2019t talk to his parents when they got home. He called in sick to work. He felt bad that Robin would have to get another ride, but he couldn\u2019t face her. He couldn\u2019t face anyone.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>After a while, he couldn\u2019t stand being in his room anymore. He took to wandering around town, avoiding places where he might see anyone he knew.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>He was at a park, just walking around, trying to find an area away from all the people. Eventually he found a secluded bench, but someone was already sitting on it. It was Will.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHey, what are you doing here?\u201d Steve asked. He had barely said anything for days, and his voice felt rusty from disuse. \u201cCan I sit?\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cSure,\u201d Will said. \u201cJust came here to think.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYeah, me too.\u201d That wasn\u2019t exactly true. Steve was mostly trying to avoid thinking right now. Thinking would make him feel sad, and angry. Right now he just felt nothing, which was better. \u201cWhat are you thinking about?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Will looked off into the distance. \u201cI\u2019m thinking about telling Dustin and Lucas that\u2026you know. I\u2019m gay. I\u2019m just worried about how they\u2019ll react.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI think they\u2019ll be okay.\u201d Dustin and Lucas were good kids. Steve had to believe they would be good about this. \u201cIt might take them a little while to, I don\u2019t know, adjust. But you guys are best friends. That\u2019s not gonna change that easily.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI guess so.\u201d Will didn\u2019t sound convinced.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhat brought that on?\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cTelling people has been pretty okay so far.\u201d Steve knew that he and Robin knew, and Jonathan and Mike. He wasn\u2019t sure if Will had told anyone else. \u201cEvery time I do, I feel a little better. I know that not everyone is going to be that accepting. But it\u2019s just so exhausting, hiding a part of myself all the time.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYeah, I know what you mean.\u201d Steve had been hiding his sexuality, his relationship with Eddie, and his true feelings for Eddie. The last one he had even been hiding from himself, somehow. \u201cI\u2019ve been meaning to tell you, actually. I would have told you when you told me, but I hadn\u2019t realized it yet.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Will looked at him. \u201cYou\u2019re gay?\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cBisexual. You don\u2019t sound surprised.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNo. I mean, I would have been, but\u2014 is there something going on between you and Eddie?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYeah,\u201d Steve said. So Will\u2019s weird looks had been because he suspected. \u201cWell. There was.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou guys broke up?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI guess. We weren\u2019t even really dating. Not officially, at least.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Steve didn\u2019t know where to begin. It was hard to tell this story without including details that he definitely didn\u2019t want to share with Will. \u201cWe started hanging out a lot. We got really close. It got\u2026\u201d he searched for a word.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cRomantic?\u201d Will offered.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYeah.\u201d Sure, Steve would go with that. It wasn\u2019t even wrong. It was true that things had gotten sexual before they got romantic, but in retrospect it really didn\u2019t take long for it to be both. \u201cBut we kept saying we were just friends. Not just to other people. To each other, and to ourselves. It took me a stupidly long amount of time to realize how I really felt about him. But I did realize, and I told him.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHe didn\u2019t feel the same way?\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Steve shook his head. \u201cThat\u2019s the thing. He did. He does.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cSo what\u2019s the problem?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Steve let out a dry laugh. \u201cYeah, I asked him the same thing. He just doesn\u2019t think we should be together.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhy not?\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t get it. He kept saying I deserved better, stuff like that. Like he wasn\u2019t good enough for me. Or good enough for anyone to care about him. He\u2019s been through a lot, but\u2013\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHis dad was abusive.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHe told you that?\u201d Steve was surprised.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Will shrugged. \u201cMostly hinted, but I got the picture.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cProbably not the whole picture. Trust me, abusive doesn\u2019t even begin to cover it. He was\u2026 a monster.\u201d Steve knew monsters. He had seen monsters. Eddie\u2019s dad was definitely up there in the rankings of worst monsters he\u2019d heard of.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Will looked down at his hands, which were folded in his lap. \u201cIt can really make you feel worthless,\u201d he said after a moment. \u201cLike, if your own dad doesn\u2019t love you, how could anyone? Why should they?\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWill\u2026\u201d Steve had never known Will\u2019s dad, but he had heard stories.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI have a lot of people who care about me. I know I do. My mom, Jonathan. All of my friends. But I still sometimes think\u2026\u201d He was still staring at his hands, not looking at Steve. \u201cSomeday they\u2019re all going to realize.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cRealize what?\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThat I\u2019m not worth it. That I deserved all the bad stuff that happened to me.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWill, of course you didn\u2019t.\u201d Steve looked at him, trying to catch his eye, but he was still looking down. \u201cOf course you\u2019re worth it.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI know,\u201d Will said. \u201cI know. But I\u2019ve had my mom and Jonathan there telling me that my whole life, and I still feel like that sometimes.\u201d He turned to Steve. \u201cWho did Eddie have?\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Steve shook his head. No one. When Eddie was growing up, he didn\u2019t have anyone telling him that he was loved, that he was worthy. \u201cHe has me, now.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cBut he doesn\u2019t believe it.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHe said if I knew everything in his past, I wouldn\u2019t care about him like that.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cDo you know what he was talking about? The stuff in his past?\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI\u2019ve got some idea.\u201d Eddie had said his dad hit him, even before the worst time. And that his parents didn\u2019t even want him after they found out he was gay. Those were the things that made Eddie feel like he was worthless. But there was also the stuff Eddie had said he wasn\u2019t proud of. Steve didn\u2019t know what that was. Sex? Drugs? Did it matter? \u201cNothing that would make me stop loving him.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cDid you tell him that?\u201d Will asked, looking at Steve with raised eyebrows.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhat, that his past doesn\u2019t matter or that I love him?\u201d It felt good to say it out loud. It felt right.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cBoth.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI didn\u2019t really get a chance to say the love part. He stopped me as soon as I said I had feelings for him. But I told him, you know, he\u2019s not </span>\n<em>\n<span>damaged.</span>\n</em>\n<span>\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cBut he is, though.\u201d Will\u2019s tone was matter-of-fact, like it was obvious.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cDon\u2019t say that.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIt\u2019s true. What he\u2019s been through left damage. Scars. I mean, physical, mental, I don\u2019t know. But he\u2019s damaged. So am I. You probably are, too. I don\u2019t mean it as an insult. It\u2019s just what happens when you go through stuff like that.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Steve didn\u2019t think he was damaged. But if he wasn\u2019t damaged by his parents, why had he felt so guilty about not getting into college when he didn\u2019t even want to go? If he wasn\u2019t damaged by the Upside Down, why did he still have nightmares about monsters and look around every room he entered to see what he might be able to use as a weapon? Eddie had said he wanted Steve to have a normal life, but how was he supposed to do that? The things he had been through made that impossible.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Will was right. It might not sound nice, but it was true. They were all damaged. All of Hawkins probably was, after the last few years.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cSo what am I supposed to say?\u201d Steve asked. \u201cYou </span>\n<em>\n<span>are </span>\n</em>\n<span>damaged, and I love you anyway?\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cSomething like that,\u201d Will said. \u201cMaybe not those exact words.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou think that will work?\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWork how? It\u2019s not going to fix him. It\u2019s not going to erase what happened to him.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI don\u2019t need it to. I don\u2019t want it to. I just want to be there for him, and show him that he\u2019s worth it. Every day. So maybe someday he\u2019ll start to believe it.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Will smiled. \u201cTell him that.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhen did you get so\u2026\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWise?\u201d Will finished, a half-smile on his face.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Steve remembered their D&amp;D session and laughed. \u201cOkay, Will the Wise. Come here, man.\u201d Steve pulled him into a hug. He couldn\u2019t believe he was getting relationship advice from one of the kids. They were really growing up. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The day after his talk with Will, Steve drove to the trailer park. He had to. He couldn\u2019t leave all those things unsaid. He couldn\u2019t live with himself if he didn\u2019t at least try.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>He knocked on the door, and Eddie answered. Steve had thought he might be angry, might even slam the door in Steve\u2019s face, but he just looked sad.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhat are you doing here, Steve?\u201d He spoke in a quiet monotone.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI need to talk to you.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWe talked.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI didn\u2019t get to say everything I needed to say.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI heard enough. Please, Steve. Just move on.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d Steve tried to stay calm, but he could hear the desperation in his voice. \u201cJust give me five minutes, Eddie. Please. If you don\u2019t like what I have to say, I\u2019ll leave.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Eddie stared at him for a moment, his expression blank, then stepped out of the doorway and walked inside. Steve followed, closing the door behind him.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Steve took a deep breath, but Eddie spoke before he had the chance.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cSteve, before you say whatever you think you want to say, just think about it for a second, okay? This doesn\u2019t make sense. We don\u2019t make sense. This isn\u2019t how it\u2019s supposed to be for you. What would your friends from high school think if they knew you were hanging around the trailer park with some drug dealing loser faggot?\u201d The word made Steve flinch. \u201cLet alone fucking him?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cEddie, why the hell would I care what anyone from high school thinks? You know all the people who matter to me. They\u2019re your friends too. They love you.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cDon\u2019t say that.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhy not? It\u2019s true. Dustin and Mike idolize you.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI really wish you wouldn\u2019t\u2014\u201c He winced, like something had stung him. \u201cThey shouldn\u2019t. They don\u2019t know anything about me. Not really. If they knew everything\u2014\u201c</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThey would still love you.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNo.\u201d Eddie shook his head. \u201cNo one would love me if they knew everything about me. And they really shouldn\u2019t.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI accept that challenge.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI\u2019m not joking, Steve.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNeither am I. I love you, Eddie.\u201d\u00a0There. It was out. Whatever came of it, at least he had gotten it out. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cDon\u2019t say that, Steve. You don\u2019t know what you\u2019re signing up for with that.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYes, I do. I know you\u2019ve been through some really serious shit, which probably fucked you up in ways that I don\u2019t fully understand\u2014\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou can\u2019t understand.\u201d His voice was strained.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cEddie, I\u2019ve been through shit, too! Some of it with you, remember? I can definitely understand some of it, okay? And the rest\u2014 I want to try. I want to understand everything. Please, Eddie. Just let me try.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Eddie just shook his head. Steve thought he saw tears in his eyes, but Eddie looked away quickly when he saw Steve looking.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI love you, Eddie. The good parts, the bad parts, the scary parts. I love you. What you\u2019ve been through, or what you\u2019ve done, or whatever it is that makes you feel like no one should love you\u2013 I don\u2019t care about all that.\u201d He shook his head. That wasn\u2019t right. He thought about his conversation with Will. \u201cNo, I do care about it. I care a lot. I\u2019m sorry you went through it, but I\u2019m not ignoring it, okay? I\u2019m not pretending it doesn\u2019t exist. I know you\u2019re not perfect, but I\u2019m not asking you to be. I know who you are. I love you.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cSteve\u2026\u201d He sounded choked up, and the tears that Steve had seen before were definitely there. Eddie wiped his eyes quickly, turning his head away.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cDo you love me, Eddie? If you really don\u2019t, I\u2019ll leave, I swear. I know you\u2019re scared, and you think you\u2019re not worth it, but just let me\u2013 please. I want to show you that you are.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cSteve.\u201d Eddie looked down at his hands, which were twisting together nervously, then up at Steve. His eyes were wide. \u201cAre you sure?\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYes.\u201d Steve stepped closer to Eddie. \u201cYes, I\u2019m sure. Probably the most sure I\u2019ve ever been about anything.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Eddie still looked uncertain, his brow furrowed. \u201cOkay. Yeah.\u201d He nodded.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Steve moved forward, taking Eddie\u2019s face in his hands. \u201cYeah?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYeah.\u201d It was like a weight had been lifted. Eddie\u2019s expression cleared, and he let out a shaky laugh. \u201cYeah, I love you, Steve.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>As soon as Eddie said it, Steve leaned forward to kiss him. Steve wanted Eddie to know how he felt, all of the love and affection and care he had, and he tried to put all of that into one kiss. He wasn\u2019t sure if he accomplished that, but he hoped there were many more kisses in the future that he could try with. He knew there were.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>When they broke apart, Steve still held Eddie\u2019s face. \u201cI love you,\u201d he said again. \u201cI love you.\u201d\u00a0He felt like he couldn't say it enough times.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Eddie smiled. \u201cI love you too.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cExcuse me,\u201d a voice said from behind them. \u201cCould you boys step to the side a bit? Just, it\u2019s the only walkway.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Eddie jumped back, away from Steve. \u201cUncle Wayne! It\u2019s not\u2014 I\u2019m not\u2014\u201c He looked at Steve, pleadingly, but Steve couldn\u2019t see a way out of this either. There was really no explanation other than the truth.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIt\u2019s fine, Eddie.\u201d Wayne\u2019s voice was even. He didn\u2019t seem angry about what he had seen, or really even surprised. \u201cJust trying to get to my room.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cBut, um.\u201d Eddie looked nervously toward Steve again, and then back at his uncle. \u201cYou\u2019re not\u2014\u201c\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cDid you think I didn\u2019t know, Eddie?\u201d Wayne asked. \u201cYou boys are </span>\n<em>\n<span>not </span>\n</em>\n<span>as sneaky as you think you are. Besides, I always knew about you, Eddie. Did you think I didn\u2019t know why that good-for-nothing brother of mine did that to you? Why I took you in? And I loved you anyway, didn\u2019t I?\u201d He paused, looking at Eddie for a long moment. \u201cI knew it wouldn\u2019t be easy for you. But all I wanted was for you to be happy. For </span>\n<em>\n<span>my kid</span>\n</em>\n<span> to be happy. So if this\u2014\u201d he looked Steve up and down \u201c\u2014</span>\n<em>\n<span>Steve Harrington </span>\n</em>\n<span>makes you happy? Well.\u201d He threw up his hands, a small smile on his face. \u201cMazel tov. Don\u2019t fuck on the couch.\u201d He walked past them toward his bedroom. Steve and Eddie watched him in disbelief.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWell,\u201d Eddie said after a moment, gesturing toward his own bedroom. \u201cYou heard the man.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>They fell onto Eddie\u2019s bed, holding each other. They kissed a little, shed a few more tears. But mostly they just talked. They talked more honestly about their feelings than they ever had. Steve felt so relieved to open up to Eddie, and to have him do the same. He was happier than he had been in a very long time.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI didn\u2019t know that my uncle knew. I figured he never would have taken me if he\u2019d known.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI can\u2019t believe he never talked to you about it.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWe don\u2019t talk a lot. That might have been the most words he\u2019s ever said to me at once. I didn\u2019t even realize he cared that much.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHe loves you.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYeah.\u201d Eddie looked bewildered. \u201cI think I\u2019ve heard those words more today than I ever have in my life.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>That broke Steve\u2019s heart a little, but he smiled at Eddie anyway. \u201cWell, get used to it. Because I love you.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhen did you know?\u201d Eddie asked. He looked at Steve with gentle curiosity. \u201cThat you were\u2026in love with me and shit.\u201d He made his voice light. He was clearly still having trouble being serious about the topic. That was okay with Steve. The fact that they were even having this conversation was enough for him, considering the drama of the past few days.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI think it happened gradually,\u201d Steve said. \u201cThere were clues that I probably should have seen sooner. But when I was sure\u2014really sure? It was that night. When you left.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Steve.\u201d Eddie met Steve\u2019s eyes. \u201cI should never have left like that. I just wasn\u2019t ready to face it.\u201d He paused. Sighed. \u201cYou were right. It got too real. I\u2019d never done that with anyone before.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cDone what?\u201d He found it hard to believe that anything they\u2019d done, that night or any other, was completely new to Eddie.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cCome on, don\u2019t make me say it.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou\u2019re going to have to say it, because I have no idea what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI\u2019d never\u2026</span>\n<em>\n<span>made love.</span>\n</em>\n<span>\u201d He cringed. \u201cOkay, that was too corny. Forget I said that.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNo,\u201d Steve said, shaking his head and smiling. It </span>\n<em>\n<span>was </span>\n</em>\n<span>corny, but he knew exactly what Eddie meant. \u201cI\u2019ll never forget it.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Eddie smiled back, a little reluctantly.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhen did you know?\u201d Steve asked.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHmm\u2026\u201d Eddie made exaggerated thinking noises. \u201cDefinitely when you took a bite out of that demobat.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cFuck off.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNo, I\u2019m serious,\u201d Eddie said. \u201cThat was\u2026\u201d he trailed off, looking wistful. \u201cThe hottest thing I\u2019d ever seen. I knew it was either love or extreme horniness. Turns out it was both.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou\u2019re a freak,\u201d Steve said, with affection.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYeah, but you love me for it.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Steve leaned in for a kiss. \u201cYeah, I do.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cGod, you guys have more hair products than Nancy,\u201d Robin said, her voice muffled behind the bathroom door.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cBut you can\u2019t argue with the results!\u201d Steve said.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Eddie, sitting next to Steve on the bed, turned toward him with a tender smile. He reached out to brush Steve\u2019s cheek and tuck a lock of hair behind his ear. \u201cI look better than you,\u201d he said softly.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Robin came out of the bathroom. \u201cSo, this is Steve\u2019s room? And the other one is Eddie\u2019s? Is that what we\u2019re saying? I just want to make sure we have our stories straight.\u201d She tilted her head. \u201cSo to speak.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Steve and Eddie looked at each other.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI don\u2019t know, Rob,\u201d Steve said. \u201cWe were kind of thinking of\u2026not doing that. Not with them.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cSo, what? This is a coming out party as well as a housewarming?\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Steve shrugged. \u201cMaybe? What do you think?\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI think they\u2019re your best friends. Our best friends. And we\u2019ve been through so much shit together that I can\u2019t imagine anything changing that.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThat\u2019s kind of what we were hoping,\u201d Steve said.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>There was a knock at the door, and the three of them rushed to it together. Robin looked through the peephole.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWho is it?\u201d Steve asked.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cUm.\u201d Robin hesitated. \u201cEverybody?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhat do you mean? How can it be everybody?\u201d Steve pushed her aside and looked. Nancy, Jonathan, Mike, El, Will, Lucas, Max, Dustin, and Vickie were all standing there. \u201cHow did they all get here at exactly the same time?\u201d This was ridiculous. There was no way they had all come together. Steve had anticipated doing this slowly, gradually. One or two people at a time. Maybe dropping a few subtle hints first. So much for that plan.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Eddie held out his hand. \u201cAre we doing this, Harrington?\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Steve put his hand in Eddie\u2019s. \u201cYeah,\u201d he said. \u201cYeah, we\u2019re doing this.\u201d He took a deep breath and opened the door.\u00a0</span>\n</p>"
