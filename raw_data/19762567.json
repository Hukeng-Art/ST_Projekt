(New Vegas for life). Then after writing it I realized I'd written Shigaraki liking a game where (SPOILERS) the central plot twist is that the villain is a child who was ripped away from his family and raised to lead a sinister villainous organization... and then I made myself sad.</p>\n<p>\n(See the end of the chapter for <a href=\"#chapter_2_endnotes\">notes</a>.)\n</p>\n<p>i didn't give natsu much focus in my todofam month fics and he deserves better, so he's the star of the show here. it's important that you all know that natsuo is taller than every single league member with a canon height. also he is indeed a med student! he studies medical welfare. i know he's canonically heat-sensitive but i still really like the hc of him being quirkless.</p>\n<p>korusukan-ku is named after coruscant, of course, following in horikoshi's proud tradition of naming everything after star wars places (see: musutafu, kamino, hosu). yes, storming tartarus is a reference to the area 51 raid, what a time to be alive.</p>\n<p>ALSO my good pal <a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/users/Saccha/pseuds/Saccha\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sacchari</a> decided to write the <b>VERY NSFW</b> <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cjOM6SVYR-qSt4V3f2I7Ny6o2Z__EgcYqXrCiauDskQ/edit?usp=sharing\" rel=\"nofollow\">thirsty tweets</a> from the video at the start of this episode. i would disintegrate my phone too. </p>\n<p>the response to every story in this universe has been absolutely mind blowing, thank you guys so much. i definitely have more stories i want to tell in this series- i want to do something following up on the deku bit at the end of this story, something focusing on a certain winged someone who's spent the story so far desperately trying to avoid getting caught in the league's videos, and, of course, more hero theory, as well as maybe others. </p>\n<p>i can't promise when any of those will be finished, since i'm currently very busy and i like to take my time on these stories, and they take longer since each is more or less self-contained, because i don't want to ever leave you guys hanging, but i definitely want to write them.</p>\n<p>&lt;3 love you, folks!</p>",
  "text": "<p>It starts with Toga\u2019s sneak-uploaded response video to a certain theorist channel publishing a theory on Dabi\u2019s true identity as Touya Todoroki. The video is about thirty seconds long, shaky and handheld, and consists of Dabi screaming obscenities and ranting against both his father and brother, blue sparks raining from his fists, as Shigaraki cackles hysterically offscreen.</p>\n<p>Despite being flagged and removed multiple times, it garners a total of upwards of five million views in the first twenty-four hours.</p>\n<p>Now, of course, that <em>could</em> have been the end of it, with the League of Villains subsiding back into the shadows of their notoriety, existing only as a threatening phantom in the public consciousness. It could have been. But Himiko Toga is a person who loves two things very much: her friends\u2026 and attention.</p>\n<p>So, perhaps unsurprisingly, that isn\u2019t the end of it at all. It\u2019s just the beginning.</p>\n<p>The first channel pops up around ten days after the Dabi/Touya debacle. It has a blank icon, and is just called <em>Himi and her Friends :)</em>. The first video, uploaded shortly after the channel creation, is as follows.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u00a0---</p>\n<p>The video opens on a slightly shaky shot of what looks like a rundown, nondescript basement. In the distance, voices can be heard yelling indistinctly, as well as the undertones of what sounds like a television in the background.</p>\n<p>The camera flips around briefly to show Toga, who puts a <em>shhh</em> finger to her lips, before flipping back around and approaching a nearby doorway. As it draws nearer, the voices (it becomes evident that there are three, all overlapping) become both louder and clearer, allowing the viewers to catch snippets.</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201c-no, listen, you are so full of shit-\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201c-just won\u2019t admit that you\u2019re wrong-\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201c-fucking fight you-\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201c-can you both just shut up-\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>The camera reaches the door, a scene coming into view: Shigaraki and Spinner glaring each other down, shouting at each other. Dabi is standing between them, a hand twisted up in each of their collars, physically holding them apart. He looks somewhere between furious and exasperated, smoke rising from the seams in his wrists. It is evident that none of them know they are being filmed.</p>\n<p>\u201cFallout Four is <em>not</em> better than New Vegas!\u201d Spinner shouts. \u201cYou\u2019re- wrong! You\u2019re just <em>wrong</em>!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNew Vegas doesn\u2019t even have a <em>plot,</em> you\u2019re just wandering around the desert!\u201d Shigaraki yells back. \u201cFallout Four has <em>story</em>!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNew Vegas lets you choose your own adventure and actually affect the wasteland! What\u2019s the point of \u2018story\u2019 if it\u2019s just Finding Nemo but <em>sadder</em>!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, what, do plot twists make you cry, you little baby?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCry with boredom, maybe! I saw it coming a mile away!\u201d</p>\n<p>The camera pans briefly over to the television- a paused game of Fallout 4 is on the screen- before moving back to the fight.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re so full of shit,\u201d Shigaraki snaps. \u201cAt least my game isn\u2019t <em>buggy as shit</em>-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>They were on a deadline!</em>\u201d Spinner cuts him off. \u201cAnd the game is even <em>more</em> impressive for the limits they had to work with!\u201d</p>\n<p>Dabi groans. \u201cAre you two done yet?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>No!</em>\u201d the two bickering parties yell at approximately the same time, before glaring at each other even more fiercely.</p>\n<p>Dabi rolls his eyes, hard, and in doing so catches sight of the camera- he focuses on it, eyes widening before narrowing abruptly. \u201cToga, you <em>better not be</em>-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s she- oh, shit,\u201d Spinner says, twisting around to catch sight of what Dabi is looking at. Dabi releases both of the shirts he\u2019d been holding, clenching his fists, and then the picture disappears into a blur of darkness as the filmographer makes a hasty escape, her giggles audible in the background.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u00a0---</p>\n<p><strong>Fallout 4 vs. Fallout New Vegas: League of Villains Debate</strong><br>\n19,787 views</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Comments \u2022 133</strong>\n</p>\n<p><strong>Ammi</strong><br>\nIs this.

The shot is at a diagonal angle, as though whoever is taking it is trying not to look like they\u2019re filming. On the table is a half-built pyramid constructed of shotglasses and playing cards. Spinner and Mr. Compress are hovering over it, the latter unmasked except for his balaclava, as Compress neatly lays a layer of playing cards over the mouths of the top layer of glasses.</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay, for real though,\u201d Spinner is saying. \u201cWhy do you carry those around everywhere?\u201d</p>\n<p>Compress smiles cryptically. \u201cYou never know when they might come in handy.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSure, but are there really that many situations where they\u2019re handy?\u201d Spinner persists. \u201cThis is like the third deck. When would you need three decks of cards?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cA magician never reveals his secrets,\u201d Compress says, unruffled, as he places a new shot glass in the center of the next layer of the pyramid.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis is boring,\u201d Dabi\u2019s voice calls, and the camera jerks over to where he\u2019s seated a few feet away, watching with a supremely bored expression, head propped up on one hand. \u201cFill the glasses, cowards.\u201d</p>\n<p>Compress raises his eyebrows (probably- it\u2019s difficult to tell behind the mask). \u201cIs that a challenge?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo what if it is?\u201d Dabi saids, grinning.</p>\n<p>Compress is silent for a moment before turning towards the direction of the camera. \u201cToga, be a darling and go grab me the whiskey.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u00a0---</p>\n<p><strong>Ten Foot Tall Shotglass Tower TOPPLES</strong><br>\n54,081 views</p>\n<p><strong>Bert Bally</strong><br>\ngod this just gets funnier the longer it goes on</p>\n<p><strong>\u6c34\u306e\u4e2d</strong><br>\nOn one hand I feel bad about all the wasted work Compress put in but on the other hand there\u2019s no way he didn\u2019t set that up to fall exactly the way it did</p>\n<p><strong>Wen Were</strong><br>\n7:02 when Dabi started sparking and everyone started screaming because of all the flammable alcohol everywhere\u2026 fdgfhdgsfhj</p>\n<p><strong>May Juugo</strong><br>\nWHY DO THESE VIDEOS KEEP GETTING TAKEN DOWN I JUST WANT TO WATCH WANTED CRIMINALS BE IDIOTS</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u00a0---</p>\n<p>\u201cToga.\u201d</p>\n<p>Toga considers her options. Shigaraki is using the Leader Voice (it was a work in progress, but had reached about a fifty percent success rate). That means whatever it is is probably serious, and furthermore, she will not be able to dodge out of this conversation.</p>\n<p>\u201cYe-essssss?\u201d she says slowly, hands tangling together behind her back.</p>\n<p>She\u2019s pretty sure she has an idea of what it was about, but that won\u2019t stop her playing dumb for as long as was humanly possible.</p>\n<p>Shigaraki stares her down. She stares back, yellow eyes big and innocent.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou need to stop posting those videos.\u201d</p>\n<p>Toga\u2019s face crumples into an expression of anguish. \u201cBut they\u2019re so fun! And they\u2019re not hurting anyone!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThey\u2019re hurting our <em>image</em>,\u201d Shigaraki says emphatically. \u201cThey\u2019re making us into a laughingstock.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cActually,\u201d Compress speaks up suddenly (Toga wonders briefly when he entered the room before deciding not to question it), \u201cI disagree. I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve been reading the comments-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course I\u2019ve been reading the comments, what do you take me for,\u201d Shigaraki mutters.</p>\n<p>\u201c-but people like the videos,\u201d Compress continues, unfazed by the interruption. \u201cMore importantly, though, they like <em>us</em>. The videos make us more relatable. More likable. Which means people are more likely to listen to our message.\u201d</p>\n<p>Shigaraki makes a considering face. \u201cSo you mean-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBefore, we launched Noumu attacks downtown to get attention. To get an audience,\u201d Compress presses. \u201cBut with the videos, we can accomplish the same thing much more successfully and, if I may say, at a much lower cost. It\u2019s just basic showmanship.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut people are <em>laughing</em> at us,\u201d Shigaraki protests.</p>\n<p>\u201cBecause they <em>like</em> us!\u201d Toga chimes in again. \u201cThey think we\u2019re fun! And funny! That\u2019s a <em>good</em> thing!\u201d</p>\n<p>Shigaraki inhales, and sits in silence for a long moment. Toga opens her mouth to continue, but Compress shoots her a warning look (or at least, she thinks he does) before she can.</p>\n<p>\u201cFine,\u201d Shigaraki finally says. \u201cBut from now on you\u2019ll run all the videos past me before you post them to make sure they don\u2019t give anything away. You\u2019re also going to give the whole League the login, so anyone can post videos. If we\u2019re doing this we might as well make it official. I\u2019m going to make one explaining our manifesto.\u201d</p>\n<p>Toga blinks. \u201cWe have a manifesto?\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u00a0---</p>\n<p><strong>League of Villains: Mission Statement</strong><br>\n201,081 views</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Comments \u2022 591</strong>\n</p>\n<p><strong>\u4e0b\u3055\u3044</strong><br>\nthis video is like 10% about the actual lov and 90% railing against stain</p>\n<p><strong>Annagramma</strong><br>\nBetween this and Hero Theory, it kinda looks like the heroes vs villains fight is going digital.

It could have been anywhere in the city. It might not even be in this prefecture.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI see,\u201d Tsukauchi mutters wearily.</p>\n<p>\u201cDr. Matamoto is having a field day, though,\u201d Yamato offers after a moment, nodding over at their department\u2019s resident criminal psychologist, who is scribbling in a notebook with the latest video paused on her computer screen.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sure she is.\u201d Tsukauchi shakes his head. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t make sense. They\u2019re more than a month now into a lull with no major criminal activity connected to them, ever since the last noumu incident. And it\u2019s not like they\u2019re releasing hostage videos or anything of the sort. They\u2019re practically a comedy channel. Even this \u2018manifesto\u2019 has <em>giggling</em> audible in the background.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell,\u201d Yamato says slowly, \u201cit\u2019s\u2026 it\u2019s better than them doing crime? Right?\u201d</p>\n<p>Tsukauchi throws his hands up. \u201cI mean, I <em>guess</em>!\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u00a0---</p>\n<p>\u201cIs it filming? Toga, is it filming? There\u2019s no little red light.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s filming! It\u2019s filming! Wait. No, it\u2019s not. Wait.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI <em>knew</em> it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay, <em>now</em> I\u2019m sure it\u2019s filming. Anyways, whenever you\u2019re ready!\u201d</p>\n<p>The video is slightly grainy from lack of light, the only source of illumination a bare light bulb somewhere off screen, and focuses on Spinner, who is sitting on a ratty couch with a low table covered in cloth. He grins at the camera.</p>\n<p>\u201cHello, YouTube! I\u2019m Spinner, of the League of Villains. And today I\u2019m gonna- uh, Toga, drumroll, please?\u201d</p>\n<p>There\u2019s the sound of someone somewhat clumsily drumming on a concrete wall before Spinner jerks the cloth off of the table with a flourish. Revealed is a spread of various sharp and shiny things, mostly knives with the occasional sword or shuriken.</p>\n<p>\u201cToday, I\u2019m gonna review some of my knife collection, for any fellow enthusiasts out there!\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u00a0---</p>\n<p><strong>Reviewing My Knives (Part 1)</strong><br>\n67,232 views</p>\n<p><strong>Lion King</strong><br>\nis he in cosplay?</p>\n<p><strong>Yoroshika</strong><br>\nMan I just realized when the league finally gets taken down we\u2019ll lose this stream of absolute comedy gold\u2026 any chance we can lobby the heroes to let them have cameras in jail?</p>\n<p><strong>Ena Matsu</strong><br>\nBruh a genuine traditional wakizashi??

Spinner reviews weapons and extols Stain\u2019s ideology. Toga films everything from prank videos to stolen makeup reviews (she favors bright red) to slightly ominous videos taken in public places, zooming in on random faces and giggling. Twice vlogs, and is terrible at it.</p>\n<p>Compress tends to upload cryptic videos, full of strange imagery, either silent or with garbled, distorted audio. Shigaraki is like, ninety percent sure he\u2019s running an ARG. At least it seems to be keeping him busy.</p>\n<p>The only one who hasn\u2019t apparently taken to it is Dabi- <em>Touya</em>, who\u2019s still sulking about getting outed in Toga\u2019s very first video. He\u2019s also angry they\u2019ve all but stopped using his dumb alias in the videos, but it\u2019s his own fault for lying to them, in Shigaraki\u2019s humble opinion.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u00a0---</p>\n<p><strong>League Youtube Tracker</strong> @LOVTracker<br>\nNew video!

I\u2019m just saying, the Internet\u2019s fucked us over before.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUh, no,\u201d Shigaraki says, shifting the jug of orange juice to his other arm so he can point at Dabi. \u201cThe Internet fucked <em>you</em> over, <em>Touya</em>, and that was because of your own brother more than, like, anything else.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t remind me,\u201d Dabi groans, head falling back so he can glare up at the smoggy sky. \u201cPeople keep commenting telling me to call my mom.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThen call her, dipshit,\u201d Shigaraki says, kicking a pebble a few feet down the alley. \u201cOr stop whining about it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not <em>whining.</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSure,\u201d Shigaraki says, and rolls his eyes again, even harder.

If we keep doing this, you know, we\u2019ll probably beat them for followers eventually.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNot if our channel gets getting deleted every fucking week,\u201d Dabi says, but he\u2019s obviously interested. Hah. Shigaraki <em>absolutely</em> has his number.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re not getting a following,\u201d Shigaraki says. \u201cThat only means more and more people are paying attention to us. What you have to understand, Touya, is that all publicity is good publicity.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u00a0---</p>\n<p><strong>Hero Theory Episode 37: Is Shigaraki Tomura Related to Shimura Nana?</strong><br>\n967,771 views</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Comments \u2022 2,072</strong>\n</p>\n<p><strong>Addie Bowie</strong><br>\nOh my god??

He mouths \u2018<em>karma</em>\u2019 with a wide grin, then flips the camera around.</p>\n<p>Shigaraki can be seen sitting on the bare concrete floor, staring blankly into the middle distance. There\u2019s a half-melted phone lying beside him, and the floor and walls all around him bear the tell-tale signs of someone with a five-point disintegration quirk having an emotional meltdown. The hands are nowhere to be seen.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey!\u201d Dabi calls from behind the phone. \u201cHow\u2019s it going over there, <em>Tenko</em>?\u201d</p>\n<p>Without hesitation, Shigaraki snatches up the half-disintegrated phone and hurls it directly at him.

I think the League of Villains is turning vigilante.</p>\n<p>First of all, a quick recap for those of you who haven\u2019t been paying attention to the League\u2019s YouTube uploads (and if you haven\u2019t been, I don\u2019t blame you, they have a new channel practically every other week and their videos get taken down even more often- @<u>LOVTracker</u> on Twitter and @<u>AchivingLOV</u> on Tumblr both do great work keeping track of them if you want to catch up):</p>\n<p>- Following the Endeavor v Noumu fight from a few months ago, where Dabi (Todoroki Touya, a story in itself worthy of a post) there\u2019s a period of radio silence from the league, with no high profile attacks. During this time members of the league, starting with Himiko Toga, start uploading youtube videos, mostly little comedic candid moments. They get popular very rapidly and the rest of the League quickly joins in.</p>\n<p>- About three and a half months into the league\u2019s rise to youtube fame, our very own boys at hero theory upload a <u>video</u> (guest starring ALL MIGHT HIMSELF) about Tomura Shigaraki potentially being the grandson of Nana Shimura/Adamant (the focus of hero theory ep 20). Kaminari says in the video that this was partially prompted by the league getting their own channel and the popularity of their other villain-based videos.</p>\n<p>- Around seven hours after this video goes up, the league (specifically Dabi) uploads a <u>video</u> that appears to confirm the theory, and furthermore that the revelation apparently had a hardcore emotional impact on Shigaraki/Shimura(?).</p>\n<p>- About a week later video uploads from the league resume, but with the notable exclusion of Shigaraki. The first video posted after the break (which you can find <u>here</u>) also features Toga saying Shigaraki has banned them \u2018from doing murders and stuff.\u2019</p>\n<p>- A few days later a burgeoning drug trafficking ring based in Musutafu is basically annihilated with signs from both Shigaraki and Dabi\u2019s quirks connected to the scene.</p>\n<p>- What I\u2019m saying is LOV = League of Vigilantes, basically.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u00a0---</p>\n<p><strong>League Youtube Tracker</strong> @LOVTracker<br>\nWe\u2019ve got a new video!!!

He looks absolutely furious, and is clearly blushing. He takes a step forward and the camera immediately disappears into a blur of motion as Toga sprints away, accompanied by manic giggling.</p>\n<p>The video then cuts to a title card by way of a clumsy Powerpoint transition: <em>League of Villains Reads Thirsty Tweets.</em></p>\n<p>It then cuts to Spinner, who is looking down at what is obviously a different phone, reading slowly aloud. \u201cCall me a\u2026 scalie\u2026 but\u2026\u201d he reads before trailing off into stammering silence. \u201cI\u2026 um\u2026 what?\u201d</p>\n<p>It then cuts to Touya, who stares at the phone for a full half minute without blinking before raising his head to glare flatly at the camera. \u201cNo.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAw, but <em>Touya-</em>\u201d Toga pouts.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>No.</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>Finally, it cuts to Twice, who reads his tweets with great enthusiasm and absolutely no hesitation.

A green-scaled hand reaches out and shoves a door to the left open, and the footage moves into a moldy bathroom. The tile is yellowish, the rusty tap dripping. The entire sink is stained black. There are rusty splashes of dried blood on the tiles and in the bathroom, and what used to be a white bathmat is now mostly brown.</p>\n<p>\u201cLook at this!\u201d Spinner\u2019s voice says from behind the camera, zooming dramatically in on the bloodstains. \u201cLook!

Noumu status: dust in the wind.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u00a0---</p>\n<p>\n<u> <strong>Breaking News: League of Villains Sighted Battling Noumu in Southern Musutafu</strong> </u>\n</p>\n<p>The League of Villains, famous for their highly-publicized attacks in Hosu and on Yuuei Academy, and more recently for their status as unexpected internet phenomenons, were sighted publically for the first time in weeks today.</p>\n<p>At approximately 17:20 in the Korusukan district of Musutafu, the police were flooded with calls reporting a massive noumu causing widespread devastation. The presence of the League was also reported; however, callers noted that the League appeared to be attempting to stop the noumu rather than controlling or encouraging it, as was the dynamic witnessed in Hosu.</p>\n<p>Heroes arrived shortly after the noumu was defeated. A search of the scene found no dead bodies save that of the noumu; the League was nowhere to be found, though multiple eyewitnesses have reported members receiving severe injuries in the brawl. Casualties are unknown but, at the moment, it is unlikely that any bystanders died, though some did require hospitalization from falling debris and smoke inhalation.</p>\n<p>As the situation is still developing, many questions are still unanswered. Foremost being: what happened to place the League at odds with the noumu when in every prior appearance they have been allies? Why did the fight take place? If the League were not controlling this particular noumu, who was?</p>\n<p>This article will be updated as more facts become clear.</p>\n<p>The location and status of the League is currently unknown.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u00a0---</p>\n<p>The video is posted about half an hour after the noumu fight. It opens on Twice. He\u2019s not wearing his mask- his face is smoke-stained, hair messy. There\u2019s a gash on his cheek, which he doesn\u2019t seem to notice, and his face is decorated with smaller cuts. He looks exhausted. No other members of the League are visible.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey,\u201d he says. \u201cSo, we\u2019re all pretty fucked up and we also pissed off our go-to doctor. I\u2019ll link a gofundme in the description. If you could donate to it so we, like, don\u2019t die, that would be super awesome. Thanks.\u201d</p>\n<p>He reaches out to turn the camera off, and the video ends.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">---\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>help us not die</strong><br>\n<em>Fundraiser Complete!</em><br>\n$105,027 raised of $5,000 goal in six hours.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u00a0---</p>\n<p><strong>Huhuu</strong> @wenwerewy<br>\nI hope the League is okay!

There\u2019s a television, hooked up by way of several extension cords that snake out of sight, quietly playing a report about the noumu battle.</p>\n<p>Shigaraki, pupils blown wide with concussion and one arm obviously broken and inexpertly splinted, leans forward from his perch on a bloody couch to squint at the intruder as the door clangs shut behind him, flexing his functioning hand in preparation to use his quirk. \u201cWho the fuck\u2026?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHey,\u201d Natsuo says, and drops the bag with a heavy thud. \u201cToga gave me your address. I\u2019m Touya\u2019s younger brother.\u201d</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a long pause, and then Twice, from where he\u2019s sprawled backwards on an overstuffed chair, says, \u201c<em>Younger?</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>Natsuo snorts, kneeling to dig through the bag. \u201cYup. He\u2019s three years older, if you believe it.\u201d He stacks a bottle of disinfectant, a box of sutures, and some other supplies into his arms.</p>\n<p>Toga, stirred by the conversation, lifts her head from where she\u2019d been dozing against Twice\u2019s side and brightens. There are bloody bandages wrapped around her head, masking one eye. \u201cOh! You\u2019re here!\u201d She twists around to call at a black lump at the end of the couch. \u201cTouya! Your brother\u2019s here!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re <em>younger</em>?\u201d Twice says again. Natsuo grins.</p>\n<p>Touya\u2019s bleary head rises from the pile of coat, squints towards Natsuo. There\u2019s a long pause. \u201c...Natsu?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHi, Touya!\u201d Natsuo says cheerfully. \u201cLong time no see, you asshole. You\u2019ve had Fuyumi worried sick. You guys were hard to find, you know.\u201d</p>\n<p>There\u2019s another long pause before Touya says, \u201cToga, once I can move again, I\u2019m going to kill you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re lucky you\u2019re alive at all, do you have any idea how fucking dangerous it is to run around with that many open wounds?

NEW VIDEO! NEW VIDEO! LINKS BELOW!\u2757\ufe0f\u2757\ufe0f</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u00a0---</p>\n<p>The first video in a week to be posted to a villain channel opens on a face that the viewers aren\u2019t familiar with, with a shock of bright white hair. There\u2019s a surgical mask pulled up over his face, but his eyes are crinkled up as though with a grin.</p>\n<p>(In the UA dorm, Todoroki Shouto swears and drops Kaminari\u2019s phone.)</p>\n<p>\u201cHey!\u201d the mystery person says, waving at the camera. \u201cSorry, not quite back to regular programming yet. But since I\u2019ve seen Twitter blowing up for the past few days, I thought you guys would appreciate some reassurance.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFirst of all,\u201d he says, and the camera flips around as he walks through a door, \u201cthe idiots are all still alive.\u201d</p>\n<p>The camera pans over Spinner (clean bandages running across his chest and one arm in a sling) and Toga (bandages wrapped around her head, giving the camera a peace sign) and pauses briefly on Touya, who has one leg in a cast and what looks to be a makeshift crutch fashioned out of fused scrap metal leaned up next to him, and is pointedly looking anywhere but the camera.</p>\n<p>\u201cFeeling better, Touya?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo. Fuck off.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNever. You\u2019re stuck with me now.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThis is hell,\u201d Touya tells the ceiling, irritably flipping off the camera in what looks like an almost automatic gesture. \u201cI\u2019m in hell.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd you deserve it,\u201d the cameraman says primly before panning to the next target- Compress, whose shoulder and torso are heavily bandaged and whose usual coat is absent.</p>\n<p>Compress nods politely to the camera, or perhaps to the cameraman, before the pan continues and comes to an eventual halt on Shigaraki.</p>\n<p>Shigaraki has one arm in a cast and appears to have his ribs wrapped in pressure bandages. There\u2019s a bright pink bandaid on one cheek. He glares directly at the camera.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat,\u201d he says, the word clearly directed at the mystery person behind the camera.</p>\n<p>\u201cYour fans want to know just what happened in Korusukan!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHow was I supposed to know that?\u201d Shigaraki complains. \u201cYou won\u2019t even let me use my phone.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cScreens are bad for concussions!\u201d the cameraman says. The camera shakes slightly- one gets the sense a finger is being waved. \u201cYou\u2019ll make the headaches worse. No screens. That\u2019s doctor\u2019s orders.\u201d</p>\n<p>Shigaraki groans dramatically. \u201c<em>Fine.</em> Not like it\u2019s much of a story, anyways. Just one old geezer being a real bastard.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe broke up with our old doc,\u201d Twice calls from offscreen. He sticks his face into frame from Shigaraki\u2019s other side, and it can be seen that his face is plastered with colorful bandaids. \u201cAnd he was a <em>bitch</em> about it!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIneloquent but basically correct,\u201d Compress agrees, half-visible on the other edge of the frame.</p>\n<p>Shigaraki rolls his eyes and waves the hand that\u2019s not immobilized in a cast, as if to say \u2018<em>yeah, that.</em>\u2019 \u201cYeah, that. So he set his latest greatest pet monstrosity on us, and we kicked its weak ass.\u201d</p>\n<p>There are some cheers from offscreen. It sounds like Spinner and Toga.</p>\n<p>\u201cRight, so that\u2019s been this week\u2019s League of Dumbasses update,\u201d the cameraman says, flipping the camera around to focus on himself again. \u201cStay tuned for more when they\u2019re all more recovered.

Todoroki, in the desk behind him, ignores him, eyes focused on his phone.</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s perfect! The villain episodes have always been hella popular, and since we know nothing about the guy we could go wild with theories! Who is he? Where did he come from? How did he get in contact with the League?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut <em>why</em>?\u201d Kaminari whines, leaning back even further to make upside-down puppy eyes at Todoroki. Suddenly, he straightens up, chair legs thumping against the floor, and whips around to look at Todoroki normally. \u201cUnless\u2026 you <em>know</em> something?\u201d</p>\n<p>Todoroki does not make eye contact. Kaminari gasps loud and long enough that Kirishima reaches over to thump him on the back, prompting a fit of coughing. Once he\u2019s recovered, he says, \u201cYou <em>do</em>!\u201d</p>\n<p>Todoroki is silent for a long moment, then rolls his eyes, pulls something up on his phone, and shoves it into Kaminari\u2019s chest. Kaminari has to scramble to grab it before it falls on the floor, and squints against the glare of the classroom lights on the screen.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s a family picture. It\u2019s a picture of a picture, really, an old and slightly singed photograph carefully aligned with the phone\u2019s camera. There\u2019s a mother, an instantly recognizable father, and four young children, all looking various degrees of stiffly uncomfortable.</p>\n<p>Kaminari focuses first on Touya (\u201cHe has a face!\u201d \u201cOf course he has a face, did you think he was born with staples?\u201d), so it\u2019s a moment before he sees it.</p>\n<p>\u201cDude.\u201d</p>\n<p>A sigh. \u201cI know.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDude.

Toga, seated crosslegged beside him on the sofa, nods seriously. \u201cBut if I was, I\u2019d say to do it all on one day, say, the fifteenth, and in a big group, and do it at around, oh, six PM, at about the time the guards are changing shifts-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Spinner, what the fuck are you doing?</em>\u201d Dabi\u00a0shouts from offscreen.</p>\n<p>\u201cNothing!\u201d Spinner yells back.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s organizing All for One\u2019s death by mob violence!\u201d Toga answers brightly at the same time.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s quiet for a moment.</p>\n<p>\u201cI guess that\u2019s okay, then,\u201d Dabi finally says.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">---\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Storm Tartarus to Kill All for One (+ Explaining the Korusukan Thing)</strong><br>\n837,402 views</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Comments \u2022 1,927</strong>\n</p>\n<p><strong>Bad for Education</strong><br>\nGfhdsjkgaf \u2018if you see this old bald bastard just brain him with a brick\u2019 god i love the LOV</p>\n<p><strong>Yonsenen</strong><br>\nwelp time to mark my calendar for the raid let\u2019s do this</p>\n<p><strong>Akio Yamato</strong><br>\nWAIT WAIT at the start at 0:03 that\u2019s the doctor guy\u2019s voice in the bg???

Toga and Twice are perched next to him, leaning together over a phone.</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay!\u201d Toga chirps, clapping her hands excitedly. \u201cLet\u2019s do this!

I mean, I ate my Wheaties. I exercised. What did I do <em>wrong</em>?\u201d</p>\n<p>Toga pats his arm, and scrolls down to the next question on the screen with her other hand. \u201c\u2018How did you end up working with the League?\u2019 Oh! I can answer this one! He messaged me on Twitter and said he wanted to help! And when he told me who he was I said sure! Next question- \u2018Are you a doctor?\u2019\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNope!\u201d Natsuo says. \u201cNot a licensed one, anyways. I\u2019m in med school. I\u2019m gonna be focused in therapy, assuming I don\u2019t get arrested over this.\u201d</p>\n<p>Toga blinks. \u201cOooh, could that happen?\u201d</p>\n<p>A shrug. \u201cProbably not. I haven\u2019t committed any actual crimes or anything. Since you guys haven\u2019t done any murdering since I\u2019ve been helping you I don\u2019t think I\u2019m even an accomplice.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHey, more motivation for us to stay on the more-or-less straight and narrow!\u201d Twice says.</p>\n<p>Toga nods. \u201cMhm! Next question- oh, actually I don\u2019t know this. \u2018What\u2019s your quirk?\u2019\u201d</p>\n<p>Natsuo grins. \u201cI don\u2019t have one!\u201d</p>\n<p>Toga and Twice both gawk in almost comical unison. \u201c<em>Really?</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a sigh in the background of the video, and then Dabi walks into frame, pausing behind the sofa. \u201cYeah, that\u2019s true. Even bigger disappointment than me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHell yeah,\u201d the disappointment in question says, and holds up a fist for a fist bump. Dabi gives it a flat look.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou have, like, seven years of absence to make up, you brat, do it or I\u2019ll call in Fuyumi.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou wanna try me?\u201d</p>\n<p>Dabi groans, and bumps his fist against Natsuo\u2019s. Twice and Toga are grinning as though the entire exchange is the best thing they\u2019ve ever seen.

But we should probably be sure there's no confusion.

His face is turned away from the camera, and his expression can\u2019t be discerned.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah. Hi. I\u2019d like to place a call to a patient there.
