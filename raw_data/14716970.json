  "text": "<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The thing Stiles hates most about death is the silence it leaves behind.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s always hated silence in general, since before he can remember. His father told him once that he used to babble to himself in his crib until he finally fell asleep. He plays loud music and puts the television on in the background while he does his homework. Maybe it\u2019s his ADD; maybe it\u2019s his anxiety. Either way, he just hates the quiet.</p>\n<p>And the silence left behind after someone dies is the worst kind, because it\u2019s always unexpected and there\u2019s never a way to prevent it. They\u2019ll be sitting at the table in the cafeteria and Scott will say without thinking, \u201cOh, yeah, Allison told me that \u2013 \u201d and then the table just falls silent while everyone grapples with her absence. Sometimes he manages to continue; sometimes someone else leaps in and changes the subject.</p>\n<p>Stiles will be listening to the radio in the Jeep and a song by Lady Gaga will come on that he remembers Allison singing and he has to pull over before he can lose control of the car.</p>\n<p>The teacher will be giving a lecture and the mere words \u2018partner up\u2019 will make everyone look at Allison\u2019s empty desk and shudder.</p>\n<p>Her absence pops its head up at the least expected moments, and there\u2019s no preparing for it, and nothing to do but sit and wait for the wrenching in his gut to subside.</p>\n<p>There have been a lot of sleepless nights lately. A lot of nightmares. A lot of stuff he doesn\u2019t want to talk about with anyone. Everyone wants him to be okay after what happened with the nogitsune. Stiles has adopted \u2018fake it til you make it\u2019 as his mantra. Scott and Lydia are dealing with Allison\u2019s loss. Derek\u2019s got his own shit going on. And he doesn\u2019t want to worry his dad, after everything that\u2019s happened.</p>\n<p>\u00a0The problem is that one sleepless night turned into two, turned into a week, and is getting close to a month now. He gets a few hours here and there. It\u2019s enough to keep him functional, but not much more than that. He\u2019s cold all the time, and he\u2019s never really hungry. He forces himself to eat, but everything tastes like cardboard.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s dealing with it the worst out of everyone, and he hates himself for that. Scott and Lydia have both found constructive ways of dealing with their grief. Lydia is studying her family heritage and how to control her banshee powers. Scott is training a lot and learning about how to be an alpha. His relationship with Kira was a little awkward for a few weeks. Kira wanted to give him space while he was dealing with Allison\u2019s loss, but it left her in a weird sort of limbo, and Scott, for his part, just wanted to be able to love her without reservation. They talked about it a lot, and Scott talked to Stiles about it while Stiles tried to hide how much hearing about it hurt.</p>\n<p>He has no right to be more upset about Allison\u2019s death than Scott and Lydia, but while they move on and build something from their grief, he can\u2019t. He can\u2019t even think about Allison without feeling the nogitsune\u2019s delight in their pain. It twists his stomach and clogs his throat and makes him want to be sick.</p>\n<p>Some days he even wants to talk about it. He wants to spill it out all over whoever\u2019s nearby. But he can\u2019t. He has no right to inflict that sort of pain on Scott or Lydia, and to be honest, they wouldn\u2019t understand anyway.</p>\n<p>So he says nothing. He drags himself out of bed every morning, exhausted after restless sleep and bad dreams, eats protein bars to keep himself from starving, forces himself to do his homework, catches a nap when he can.</p>\n<p>Everyone treats him with kid gloves, and it annoys the hell out of him. They\u2019ll stop talking when he comes into the room, or pester him into finishing his energy bar even though he doesn\u2019t want it. He knows that they\u2019re just worried, but that only makes it worse. He doesn\u2019t know why they think he\u2019s worth all of this, after what happened. They don\u2019t seem to understand that he\u2019s the one responsible for what happened.</p>\n<p>They did so much to save him, but he doesn\u2019t feel saved at all. And that only makes the guilt a hundred times worse.</p>\n<p>So he fakes it, keeping in mind the idea that someday he\u2019ll make it. He goes through the motions, goes to class and lacrosse practice. He makes salads for his father and tries to convince him to eat them, he pokes his nose into his father\u2019s detective work not because he cares, but because he knows it will look odd if he doesn\u2019t.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s not usually involved when supernatural shenanigans are afoot, because everyone is trying to keep him safe. But he tends to hear about them afterwards, when they\u2019re crashing at Derek\u2019s so he can explain to them exactly how little they know about all this stuff.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo what\u2019s a wendigo?\u201d Scott asks one evening, having called a pack meeting.</p>\n<p>\u201cCannibalistic shapeshifter,\u201d Derek says, not looking up from his book. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p>\n<p>Scott regales them with the story of how one had attacked him at the hospital, how he\u2019d had his hands full with a kid from the lacrosse team who was there for \u2013 Stiles stops listening at that point. He\u2019s cold and his stomach is growling and it\u2019s making it hard for him to concentrate. He unwraps one of his energy bars and takes a mouthful, forcing himself to chew and swallow the unappetizing mess.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo then I\u2019m halfway off the roof with that guy on my back,\u201d Scott is saying, \u201cand I only barely got him off in time to grab Liam before he could fall. I was this close to grabbing his arm in my teeth.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek glances up at this and says, \u201cProbably a good thing you didn\u2019t.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Scott asks. \u201cI mean, better that than falling to his death, right?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, yes, but still.\u201d Derek looks back down at his book and continues, \u201cEver wondered why werewolf bites are always in the abdomen?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0Scott blinks a little, and at this, Stiles looks up curiously. \u201cI guess I thought it was to hide them. You know, you don\u2019t want your nearly turned beta wandering around with a bite wound for hunters to see.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0Derek shakes his head. \u201cThe place you give the Bite has meaning. Biting someone on the side is to make them your beta. It makes them your subordinate, but it also invites them into the pack with the full protection of the alpha. Biting someone on the legs indicates that you\u2019re turning them to an omega. And biting someone on the arm, particularly the wrist, turns someone as your equal. It\u2019s a mating ritual.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0Stiles nearly chokes on a mouthful of granola. \u201cA what?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0The others give him the side-eye, but Derek says, \u201cA mating ritual. You know, wolves mate for life and that whole thing.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u201cWhoa, that would have been awkward!\u201d Scott says, laughing. \u201cI don\u2019t know, I know that it\u2019s normal for an alpha to turn betas, but . . .\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0He gets sidetracked onto that topic, while Derek doesn\u2019t say much because the loss of Erica and Boyd are still so fresh to him. Neither of them notices the way Stiles is still sitting with his jaw ajar, thinking of Peter holding onto his wrist that day in the parking lot. It seems like it was eons ago, to be honest. So much has happened since then.</p>\n<p>\u00a0He\u2019s never really understood why Peter offered him the Bite, for a lot of reasons. He doesn\u2019t understand why Peter would want him in his pack, and he especially didn\u2019t understand why Peter gave him a choice \u2013 and not only that, but respected his refusal. He had chalked it all up to \u2018Peter is weird\u2019 but now he\u2019s wondering if there\u2019s something else to it.</p>\n<p>\u00a0It\u2019s been a while since he\u2019s seen Peter, now that he\u2019s thinking about it. He had made himself scarce during the final days of the nogitsune\u2019s presence \u2013 a rather intelligent move, all things considered. Even before that, Stiles hadn\u2019t been exactly sure what to make of him. He\u2019s an asshole, sure, but Stiles knows that he can be an asshole sometimes, too. That didn\u2019t bother him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0Peter had done terrible things, but Derek still seemed to want him around for some reason, so everyone else tolerated him. And he had never, even in their brief moments together, said <em>anything</em> to Stiles about having proposed werewolf-marriage that day last winter.</p>\n<p>\u00a0Stiles resolves not to worry about it. He\u2019s probably just misunderstanding some aspect of werewolf culture. It can\u2019t actually mean what he thinks it means, and even if it does, who cares? He turned Peter down. It was over a year ago now. He hasn\u2019t mentioned it, and probably doesn\u2019t want to talk about it.</p>\n<p>\u00a0That thought gets him home, through a bowl of cereal, and a tepid shower. He crawls into bed and tries to pretend he\u2019s going to sleep.</p>\n<p>The thing is, it\u2019s a bad night, even worse than usual. He tosses and turns, and dozes briefly but wakes up shouting after a nightmare. His father is working night shift, which he hates. He constantly worries about his father, and it\u2019s even worse when he\u2019s working nights. He reminds himself that he can\u2019t just text his father every time he\u2019s worried over nothing. He wouldn\u2019t do anything else.</p>\n<p>But he can\u2019t stop worrying, and he can\u2019t focus, and he just wants to <em>sleep</em>, and the frustration is so thick in his throat that he can almost taste it. Somehow, and he\u2019s not really sure how, this leads to him getting out of bed just past midnight, throwing on some clothes, and heading over to Peter\u2019s apartment. He doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s going to say, or why he\u2019s doing it. He just wants to <em>feel</em> something. Maybe it\u2019ll be good if Peter gets angry at him. Anger has to be better than this nothingness that\u2019s consumed him ever since the nogitsune spit him out.</p>\n<p>\u00a0With his luck, he\u2019s half-expecting that Peter won\u2019t be there. But he is, still up and dressed in one of his ubiquitous V-necks and jeans. He arches an eyebrow and says, \u201cLook who the cat dragged in.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0Stiles takes two steps forward and kisses him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0It\u2019s not much of a kiss. Then again, he doesn\u2019t really have a great track record when it comes to kissing. He enjoyed kissing Heather, but the kiss he shared with Lydia was weird, and everything after that is hazed over. He thinks he kissed Malia in Eichen House, but it\u2019s so hard to know what of all that was real and what wasn\u2019t. He hasn\u2019t wanted to think about what happened in Eichen House, and he\u2019s done his best not to.</p>\n<p>\u00a0Peter doesn\u2019t really respond, although he doesn\u2019t push Stiles away. They stand there with their lips mashed awkwardly together until Stiles pulls away and tries to take a deep breath.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u201cAre you ill?\u201d Peter asks him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u201cYes,\u201d Stiles says, without thinking. \u201cI\u2019m not \u2013 I\u2019m not right. I can\u2019t feel <em>anything</em> anymore. I just wanted to feel something.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0Peter cocks his head to one side, looking at Stiles with some curiosity. Then he closes the door behind him and backs Stiles up to the wall. \u201cLike this,\u201d he murmurs, and kisses him again. Stiles lets Peter coax his lips open, feels Peter\u2019s tongue against his teeth. He waits for his body to respond, but it doesn\u2019t.</p>\n<p>\u00a0After a few moments, Peter pulls away. \u201cBetter?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0Stiles shakes his head, and is suddenly aware that he\u2019s crying. \u201cNothing\u2019s real,\u201d he says, and the dam bursts and everything he\u2019s kept inside for the past month comes flooding out. \u201cThis isn\u2019t even my body. The nogitsune stole my body and spit this one out and now I\u2019m stuck in it. I can\u2019t feel anything. Sometimes I feel cold, I guess. I\u2019m tired all the time. Everything I eat tastes like ash, nothing, nothing\u2019s real anymore \u2013 \u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0He continues in this vein for quite some time while Peter draws him over to the sofa and sits him down. Peter doesn\u2019t say anything, although he does take a book off a shelf and start flipping through. It\u2019s some huge magical text, labeled in Latin.</p>\n<p>\u00a0Finally, Stiles winds down. \u201cOkay, wow, sorry. I didn\u2019t really mean to show up at your door at midnight, throw myself at you, and then cry all over your sofa.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u201cYou\u2019re right, you know,\u201d Peter says, glancing up.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u201cAbout which part?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u201cAbout not being right.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m right about not being right?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u201cPrecisely.\u201d Peter gives him a sideways look and a smile that shows teeth. \u201cI had done some research on the nogitsune back after we found out that was what we were dealing with. I\u2019m the one who knew how to get it out of you, if you recall. I think I know what\u2019s happened.\u201d He sits down in the chair across from Stiles. \u201cA person, no matter their species, consists of four parts. Body, heart, mind, and soul. All of those things come together to form one complete person. But you\u2019re . . . detached. You\u2019re all in one place, but you haven\u2019t come together to be whole again.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0Stiles\u2019 jaw sags slightly. \u201cOh, I . . . that sounds, you know, bad.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u201cIt is bad. Given time, you\u2019ll probably deteriorate even further. But the good news is, I can fix you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0At this, Stiles eyes him suspiciously. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u201cYou\u2019re a great kisser.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0Stiles gives a snort of laughter despite himself. \u201cNo, seriously, why?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0Peter is quiet for a long moment. Then he says, \u201cBecause I know what it\u2019s like. To blame yourself for things that aren\u2019t your fault. To lose so much that it\u2019s hard to remember why you have to keep going.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0Stiles looks away, and snuffles a little. \u201cOkay. Yeah. What do I have to do?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u201cYou\u2019re going to need a few things . . .\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0Stiles listens while Peter describes the spell. About an hour later, he\u2019s back at Peter\u2019s loft. Peter has drawn an intricate symbol on the floor and has Stiles stand in the center. \u201cHere, drink this,\u201d he says, handing Stiles a cup of tea. It\u2019s a little tart and astringent, but not bad. They put down the items Stiles has gathered at the cardinal points. A lock of his hair, for the body. A coil of red string from his crime wall, for the mind. Some dirt from Allison\u2019s grave, for the heart. And his father\u2019s still-crumpled Sheriff\u2019s badge, for the soul.</p>\n<p>\u00a0Peter sits across from Stiles and reads some Latin for so long that Stiles is swaying on his feet by the end of it. He thinks there are some flashing lights and some mist or something like that, but honestly he doesn\u2019t even know. He\u2019s barely aware as the spell comes to an end.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d Peter asks.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u201cJust . . . tired,\u201d Stiles mumbles.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u201cCome lie down,\u201d Peter says, steering him over to a door that Stiles hadn\u2019t noticed. He feels fabric against his skin and then someone is tucking a blanket around his shoulders and then he\u2019s asleep.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>~ ~ ~ ~</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0When Stiles wakes up the next morning, he\u2019s warm and comfortable. Something smells good. He rubs his face into the pillow, trying to figure out where the hell he is. Then he realizes the smell isn\u2019t the pillow. It\u2019s food. He crawls out of bed, memory returning in dribs and drabs.</p>\n<p>\u00a0Peter\u2019s in the kitchen, wearing an honest-to-God apron, which Stiles takes only passing notice of. He\u2019s much more focused on the food. There\u2019s bacon and French toast. Peter hands him a plate and he\u2019s filling his face before he even says good morning.</p>\n<p>\u00a0It\u2019s the best God damned food he\u2019s ever tasted. He\u2019s had orgasms that weren\u2019t anywhere near as good as the first piece of bacon that passes his lips. He practically moans. Peter looks amused but doesn\u2019t say much, letting him eat, and finally saying, \u201cGo take a shower. You smell. I\u2019ve left some clothes for you on the bathroom sink.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0Stiles flips him off but does as he\u2019s told. The hot shower feels almost as good as the breakfast tasted. He doesn\u2019t leave until the water starts to turn tepid. Peter has left a pair of sweat pants and a T-shirt that Stiles puts on. He goes back out into the other room and finds Peter curled up on the sofa with a mug of tea. \u201cThought you were going to stay there all day,\u201d Peter remarks. \u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u201cActually not too bad,\u201d Stiles says. \u201cI mean, two years ago I probably would have said I felt normal. But in comparison to how I felt yesterday, I feel like I could fly.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u201cYeah?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u201cYeah. That spell was legit, so, you know. Thanks.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0Peter sets the book aside and gives Stiles that toothy grin. \u201cThat? Oh, I just made all that up.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0Stiles\u2019 jaw sags. \u201cWhat?!\u201d he squawks.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u201cYou want to know why you were cold and tired all the time? Because you weren\u2019t sleeping. Want to know why everything tasted like cardboard? Because the only thing you were eating were those disgusting energy bars. Nothing magical about it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u201cBut there were like \u2013 lights, and, and fog, I think? Honestly I\u2019m not even oh my God you drugged that tea, didn\u2019t you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0Peter nods, still smiling. \u201cWhile you were out gathering the components, I set up a little light show. That plus the drugs made it seem like some real magic had happened.\u201d Peter stands up, tossing his book aside, but he\u2019s surprisingly serious as he says, \u201cEverything that happened with the nogitsune \u2013 it\u2019s no surprise that you were fucked up. I just gave your brain a little reboot. All you needed was an excuse to start feeling okay again.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0Stiles\u2019 mouth opens and shuts several times. \u201cI\u2019m not sure if I should be punching you or kissing you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u201cWell, kissing me didn\u2019t seem to do a lot for you last night,\u201d Peter says, and quirks that damnable eyebrow again. \u201cCare to give it a try again today?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0Stiles leans in, and Peter closes the distance. It\u2019s . . . nice. Not exactly earth-shattering, but warm and gentle and pretty much the opposite of everything Stiles would have expected. When he pulls away, he searches for something to say. What comes out is, \u201cSo, um. This is happening.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0Peter gives a snort of laughter and returns to the sofa. \u201cYou should probably go. It\u2019s nearly noon, and people will be wondering where you are.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u201cYeah, okay. Thanks. I, um, you know. Just. Thanks.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0Peter picks up his book again, and doesn\u2019t look up as Stiles leaves.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>~ ~ ~ ~</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>By the time a few days have passed, what happened at Peter\u2019s apartment feels almost like a dream. It can\u2019t have actually happened the way he remembered it. No way was Peter that reassuring, that helpful, that <em>kind</em>. It flies in the face of everything Stiles knows about him \u2013 although he has to admit that in reality, that isn\u2019t much. If he considers everything that happened between the fire and Peter\u2019s resurrection as a bout of insanity, he really doesn\u2019t know much about Peter at all.</p>\n<p>Peter seems to disdain most of them, but it can\u2019t be denied that he\u2019s helped them, for the most part. He might be loath to actually get his hands dirty, but he helped them look for Erica and Boyd, helped Derek plan how to face Deucalion. In the hospital, he had been genuinely worried about Cora. So maybe he isn\u2019t as bad as Stiles has been assuming he is.</p>\n<p>Of course, if everything that happened actually happened the way he remembered it, he feels like he should say or do something. Send Peter a fruit basket, maybe? Did Hallmark make a \u2018thanks for fixing my brain\u2019 card?</p>\n<p>All of which is somehow secondary to the fact that he can\u2019t stop thinking about the fact that he and Peter kissed. Three times. Okay, they weren\u2019t exactly the best kisses in the universe, but that means he\u2019s kissed Peter more than he has kissed any other person on Earth (he thinks. He\u2019s still not sure about Malia, and still doesn\u2019t want to probe too deeply into those memories.).</p>\n<p>He keeps finding himself thinking about Peter at odd moments, when his mind wanders. Peter\u2019s mouth. Peter\u2019s arms. Peter\u2019s neck.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s embarrassing, frankly. There are other things he should be thinking about. He\u2019s not a lovesick kid. Now that he\u2019s not as fucked up, he needs to focus on school and lacrosse. He should be making sure Scott and Lydia are okay \u2013 but it\u2019s still so painful to be around them. He sure as hell can\u2019t talk to them about this. They both hate Peter \u2013 not unreasonably \u2013 and how can he talk to Scott about anything romantic, after what happened to Allison?</p>\n<p>All in all, he\u2019s a mess. Okay, he\u2019s a functional mess now, a mess that\u2019s going to school and able to enjoy a hot shower and eat pizza with friends. A mess that has been jerking off while thinking about Peter Hale way too much. A mess who still has insomnia. A mess who is currently standing on Peter\u2019s doorstep again because he can\u2019t sleep, wondering what the fuck he\u2019s doing there.</p>\n<p>He stands there for far too long. At least a full minute passes, before Peter opens the door and says, \u201cAre you going to stand out there all night?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI was thinking about it, yeah,\u201d Stiles says. Peter rolls his eyes and steps back, leaving the door open for Stiles to enter or not. Stiles walks in and shuts it behind him. \u201cI, uh, I couldn\u2019t sleep,\u201d he finally says. \u201cMaybe you could give my brain another reboot?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat trick only works if you don\u2019t know what I\u2019m doing,\u201d Peter says, placing a bookmark in the book he\u2019d been reading and setting it aside. \u201cBut you knew that, didn\u2019t you. So what are you actually doing here?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cJesus, I don\u2019t know, okay?\u201d Stiles says. \u201cAll I know is that last time I was feeling super fucked up, I came here and I left actually feeling like a human being again. I don\u2019t know what I want you to do. Just, just fix me, okay?\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter sighs. \u201cYou do know there\u2019s not actually a magic wand I can wave, right? Yes, last time I made you feel better. But I\u2019m not your therapist.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, last time I talked to one of those, she turned out to be a witch who worked for an insane alpha,\u201d Stiles says. \u201cThen I wound up in what was theoretically a psychiatric hospital but actually turned out to be a haunted torture chamber. I barely remember what happened there. I think I might have killed somebody, I definitely might have had sex in their basement with a girl I barely knew, I\u2019m pretty sure I just walked out when the nogitsune took over without anyone batting an eyelash, and now they\u2019re charging my father thousands of dollars for the quote-unquote care I received. I think I\u2019ll pass on the possibility of trying that again.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter considers that for a moment before he says, \u201cFair enough!\u201d and settles back onto the sofa. \u201cBut I\u2019m trying to watch this, so if you want to stay, you\u2019ll be quiet.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Stiles toes his shoes off and sits down next to him. Peter has already taken the video off pause, and Stiles sees that he was watching a nature documentary about carnivorous plants. Stiles isn\u2019t sure what he was expecting, but somehow this seems perfectly in line with the Peter he knows. Stiles sprawls out against the arm of the sofa and falls asleep within minutes.</p>\n<p>When he wakes up the next morning, still on the sofa, he finds that Peter is again cooking. This time he\u2019s making eggs benedict, which is certainly more complicated than anything Stiles ever bothers to make. \u201cSo do you like to cook?\u201d he asks, as he steals Peter\u2019s mug of coffee.</p>\n<p>Peter gives him a look and points at the mug rack and the pot of coffee sitting on the counter. \u201cAs it happens, I do.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles considers that as he makes his own mug of coffee and downs half of it in one swig. \u201cYeah, you like . . . have an apron. That says \u2018I believe I can fry\u2019. I mean. Did you buy that for yourself? Did someone give that to you? You\u2019re seriously fucking with my world view here, I want you to know that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, I can see how the concept of an individual who requires sustenance to live knowing how to cook would be completely unfathomable,\u201d Peter says.</p>\n<p>\u201cJust gonna glide past the apron with the stupid pun? Okay.\u201d Stiles takes a bite of the eggs and moans. \u201cOh God these are good.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter shakes his head a little as he dishes up his own plate. \u201cThe apron was a gift from Talia.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh.\u201d Stiles swallows and thinks that over. \u201cHuh. Okay. I didn\u2019t think you really had anything . . . left from back then. Which is probably super insensitive of me to say.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter shrugs. \u201cI have plenty of things from back then. I didn\u2019t live at the house, if you didn\u2019t know. I had an apartment. Not this one,\u201d he adds, gesturing to their surroundings. \u201cOne out on the east edge of town, closer to the den. After the fire, some benevolent soul packed up my things and moved them into a storage unit for me. When I got this place, I went and retrieved them. Curiosity satisfied?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah. I guess. No.\u201d Stiles frowns. \u201cWhy were you at the house that night, if you didn\u2019t live there?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBecause I\u2019d heard a rumor that it might be attacked. Not that my being there mattered.\u201d Peter sets down his fork. \u201cThat\u2019s the last question I\u2019ll answer about that. Your turn. Why are you showing up on my doorstep when you feel like shit? Don\u2019t you have friends for that sort of thing?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI can\u2019t \u2013 \u201d Stiles\u2019 throat is suddenly tight, and he has to force down the food he\u2019s got in his mouth. \u201cI can\u2019t talk to Scott and Lydia about this. Allison was \u2013 she meant so much to them. There\u2019s a part of me that knows it wasn\u2019t my fault, but \u2013 I just can\u2019t. I try but the words dry up in my mouth. They\u2019re both trying to heal in their own way. I don\u2019t want to drag them down with me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter sighs. \u201cYour father, then.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles shakes his head. \u201cI\u2019ve made him worry about me too much as it is. I want him to think I\u2019m okay.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLeaving aside your terrible logic, as I\u2019m sure he would rather know you\u2019re okay and have you actually <em>be okay</em>, I\u2019m sure there must be someone else.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThere isn\u2019t.\u201d Stiles studies his hands. \u201cThere isn\u2019t anybody who would \u2013 understand.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWonderful,\u201d Peter says.</p>\n<p>Caught between amusement and annoyance, Stiles says, \u201cHey, pal, this is on you. You could\u2019ve thrown me out that first time, but instead you drugged my tea, put on a light show, and fixed my brain. You\u2019re stuck with me now, whether you like it or not. You\u2019ve really only got yourself to blame.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter rolls his eyes and takes another drink of his coffee. They eat in silence for several minutes before he says, \u201cAllison\u2019s death wasn\u2019t your fault.\u201d</p>\n<p>The food turns to ash in Stiles\u2019 mouth. He has to fight down a wave of nausea at Peter\u2019s words, thinking of the way the nogitsune had controlled him. He puts down his fork and focuses on breathing for a few seconds. \u201cI remember, you know. I remember all of it. And if it had just been controlling my body while I rode backseat, that would be awful enough, but . . . but it was part of me. I felt what it felt. I felt strong, powerful . . . <em>amazing</em>. I can\u2019t stop thinking about that. It\u2019s not bad enough that that thing killed people. It\u2019s that it <em>loved</em> killing people, and so while it was me, so did I. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever forget how that felt.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter regards him for a few moments before saying, \u201cThat still doesn\u2019t make Allison\u2019s death your fault.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI know,\u201d Stiles says. \u201cBut I feel like . . . every day, for the rest of my life, I\u2019m going to go to bed and see her dying in Scott\u2019s arms. Every night, I\u2019m going to dream about what that thing made me do, made me feel. I can\u2019t . . . it\u2019s been over a month and I\u2019m already pretty much out of my mind. I can\u2019t even think about how to deal with this in the long-term.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThen don\u2019t,\u201d Peter says. \u201cTake it one day at a time. That\u2019s what I\u2019ve always done, and look at how well-adjusted I am.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles gives a snort. \u201cSo, I\u2019m doomed. Okay. Good to know.\u201d</p>\n<p>But it is good to know, really. Because despite Peter\u2019s many flaws, he\u2019s still in one piece. He still gets up every morning and keeps walking. Well-adjusted or not, Peter is smart and strong and has survived the unsurvivable. If Peter can do it, so can he.</p>\n<p>It gives him the courage to face the day, at least. It\u2019s a school day, and he goes home to grab his things. One day at a time, he tells himself as he looks at Allison\u2019s empty seat in history class. Survive today, then worry about the next.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>~ ~ ~ ~</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>A few days later, Stiles takes a nap after school and wakes up from the nightmare in a cold sweat. He forces himself through his homework, through making dinner, but as soon as his father leaves to work night shift, he flees the house. He can\u2019t stop thinking back to Allison\u2019s body, to the feeling of the nogitsune\u2019s lust for pain flowing through his veins. He nearly throws up twice on the way.</p>\n<p>When he knocks, nobody answers. He knocks again, more loudly and rapidly. Still nothing. Frustrated, he takes a bobby pin out of his wallet and picks the lock.</p>\n<p>The apartment is dark and empty, so at least Peter wasn\u2019t just ignoring him. Stiles wishes he was there, but finds that even just being in Peter\u2019s apartment is easing his nerves. He wraps himself in a blanket and curls up on the sofa, turning the television on. He channel surfs without thinking, letting the tension seep out of his body.</p>\n<p>The key turns in the lock about a half an hour later, and Peter comes in carrying a paper grocery bag. He gives Stiles a long-suffering look. \u201cDid you break into my apartment?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCry about it,\u201d Stiles says.</p>\n<p>Peter rolls his eyes. This time, he doesn\u2019t bother to ask what Stiles is doing there. He just heads into the kitchen. Stiles watches him over the back of the sofa, and blinks in surprise when a black cat emerges from the bedroom and jumps up onto the bar that separates the kitchen from the living room. \u201cWhoa, I didn\u2019t know you had a cat.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t like new people, so he was probably giving you a wide berth the first few times you were here,\u201d Peter says. \u201cBut now it\u2019s his dinner time, so he\u2019s willing to brave the stranger.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles watches the cat, sleek and short-haired with round green eyes, as it rubs its face against Peter\u2019s shoulder and makes a <em>mrow</em> noise. \u201cWhat\u2019s his name?\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter hesitates for just a moment before he says, \u201cT\u2019Challa.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles blinks again. \u201cYou. Have a black cat. Named T\u2019Challa.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, I do,\u201d Peter says, staring him down. \u201cWhat\u2019s your point?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMy point is that if you\u2019re a closet nerd, I\u2019m going to be <em>delighted</em>,\u201d Stiles says, with a mile wide grin.</p>\n<p>Peter\u2019s gaze turns icy. \u201cI\u2019m not a nerd.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWho\u2019s your favorite Avenger?\u201d Stiles asks.</p>\n<p>After a long moment, Peter mutters, \u201cWasp. It\u2019s fucking criminal that they left her out of the movies.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles chortles, heaving himself up off the sofa. \u201cOh my God. This is the best day ever.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t see what you\u2019re so excited about,\u201d Peter says, shaking cat food into a dish and then getting a can out of the pantry while T\u2019Challa makes demanding noises. \u201cI grew up reading those comic books, like many other men my age. Having a favorite Avenger doesn\u2019t make me some sort of circus freak.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, I know, but like . . .\u201d Stiles tries to think of a way to explain this. \u201cWe actually have something in common. That\u2019s a little weird.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe have a lot in common,\u201d Peter says, spooning cat food into the dish and setting it down on the bar. \u201cDespite whether or not you\u2019d like to admit it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay, true, but we have something <em>normal</em> in common. Do you like Star Wars? Tell me you like Star Wars. Tell me that you own the originals and not the weird \u2018updated\u2019 versions. Tell me Han shot first. Tell me that you think it\u2019s ridiculous that they discarded the extended universe rather than bringing Mara Jade to the big screen.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI was disappointed by that,\u201d Peter says, \u201cbut I quite liked Finn and Rey so I decided it could be forgiven.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHoly shit,\u201d Stiles says. \u201cI am so turned on right now.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter gives a snort of laughter and says, \u201cThat\u2019s an interesting kink you\u2019ve got there, Stiles.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShut up and come watch Clone Wars with me.\u201d</p>\n<p>He falls asleep on Peter\u2019s sofa again, with T\u2019Challa sprawled across his stomach.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>~ ~ ~ ~</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0Peter\u2019s apartment quickly becomes his safe place. When he\u2019s overwhelmed dealing with life, with his family or friends, with supernatural bullshit or school work, with anything, he finds sanctuary there. Sometimes Peter is there, sometimes he isn\u2019t. When he\u2019s not, Stiles curls up on the cushion under the big bay window with a book and some tea. The cat will usually come over and rest just out of arm\u2019s reach as if his being in Stiles\u2019 presence is a complete coincidence.</p>\n<p>When Peter is there, they\u2019ll watch a movie or some TV, or they\u2019ll talk about books or comics or the random trivia that they both collect. They rarely talk about whatever trouble is plaguing Beacon Hills. Stiles isn\u2019t even always in the know. He\u2019s aware that his friends \u2013 Scott particularly \u2013 are trying to keep him sheltered from any danger that comes to town. Part of him is grateful, another part insulted. It balances out to resignation. Whatever Peter knows \u2013 probably far more than anyone realizes \u2013 is unimportant to him.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s rare that they talk about their own lives, past or present, but Stiles slowly learns things about Peter, things he never would have guessed. For one thing, Peter doesn\u2019t just like cooking \u2013 he loves it. He\u2019s the sort of person who drives an extra twenty minutes to get to the grocery stores with ingredients he can\u2019t find locally. He owns a sous vide cooker and a dehydrator. He has more recipes memorized than Stiles has ever made.</p>\n<p>And it\u2019s not just that he likes to cook \u2013 he clearly likes to cook <em>for Stiles</em>. He asks what sort of things Stiles likes, modifies recipes so they\u2019re more to his tastes, has Stiles sample things while in progress. It\u2019s a little bit weird, but Stiles finds that he likes it, a lot more than he would have expected if someone had told him about it two months prior.</p>\n<p>Peter went to college at Berkeley and majored in history and political science. He spent a semester abroad in Denmark and had been slowly working towards getting a Ph D in the history of the supernatural, in \u201chow mythology and legend are based in and color our perceptions of reality\u201d. He had been to archeological digs on three different continents.</p>\n<p>He had owned two cats at the time of the fire. They had been picked up by the same good Samaritan who had packed up his things, and rehomed. He\u2019s thought about trying to get them back, but it\u2019s been six years. He assumes they\u2019re content with their new families.</p>\n<p>He had never gotten along with Talia, which seems to make his anger and guilt about her death worse. Like Stiles does, he second-guesses things he did in the days before the fire. He doesn\u2019t talk much about it, but it\u2019s in the little things he says, the tone underneath his words. Although he hadn\u2019t much cared for her, he had loved her children, a brood of five of which there were three survivors. He mentions time he had spent with them, gifts he had gotten for them. His grief over the death of the two youngest is clearly still strong. He talks about them frequently, especially when he cooks, but he never mentions Laura. The one time Stiles tries to ask about her, Peter just turns to him and says, flatly, \u201cNo.\u201d Stiles hadn\u2019t argued, and he didn\u2019t ask again.</p>\n<p>After a month goes by, Stiles is going over to Peter\u2019s three or four times a week, and not just when he needs to escape his father\u2019s concern or his friends\u2019 grief. He\u2019s going over just because he likes going there. He has no idea what to make of Peter\u2019s actual personality, and can\u2019t come up with a good way to ask. It\u2019s not like Peter isn\u2019t still his snarky self \u2013 Hell, half of the fun they have is judging other people together \u2013 or that he\u2019s any less, well, <em>Peter</em> about it when the others need his help with something. But it\u2019s still so hard to reconcile that with the things Peter did when they met, or the way he acts around the others.</p>\n<p>Once, and only once, he makes the mistake of going over to Scott\u2019s straight from Peter\u2019s, without stopping at home to shower and change clothes. Scott immediately frowns as soon as he gets his scent. \u201cWas Peter bothering you?\u201d he asks, forehead wrinkling with concern.</p>\n<p>Stiles notes with tired amusement that Scott immediately assumes Peter is the bad guy in this situation. But he doesn\u2019t bother to correct him, because he\u2019s not up to an argument. \u201cNo, I went over to his place to see if he had a book on banshees,\u201d he says. They\u2019ve been helping Lydia learn about her heritage and her powers lately. Lying to werewolves isn\u2019t that hard with enough practice \u2013 and his heartbeat always feels too fast these days anyway. \u201cHe had to know about her somehow, right? I thought he might have something that could help out.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDid he?\u201d Scott asks.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo. Says he lost most of his books in the fire.\u201d Another lie. But Scott accepts it, nodding. Stiles gingerly tests the waters. \u201cHe\u2019s actually been less of a jerk lately, huh? I mean, he did help out when I was possessed.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe only did that because Lydia agreed to tell him who his daughter is,\u201d Scott says.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, yeah.\u201d Stiles had almost forgotten about the fact that Peter has a daughter. He doesn\u2019t know what to make of it, and Peter doesn\u2019t talk about it. He makes a mental note to try to broach that topic and see how far he gets with it.</p>\n<p>Scott changes the subject, asking about something that had happened at school. They hang out for a little while, until the conversation trails off. Whenever this happens, Stiles feels the silence in his bones. He always feels like there\u2019s something he needs to say, but he never knows what it is. It\u2019s an awful feeling, being uncomfortable around Scott. He knows it\u2019s not Scott\u2019s fault, but even so, he flees the McCall house as quickly as he can.</p>\n<p>Peter glances up from the sofa as Stiles lets himself back in. \u201cDidn\u2019t think you\u2019d be back today.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, I . . .\u201d Stiles can barely choke out the words. The rift between him and Scott is a physical pain in his chest, in his gut. It\u2019s hard to breathe around it. He sinks onto the sofa, and then before he can think better of the idea, crawls into Peter\u2019s lap and buries his face in Peter\u2019s shoulder. He feels Peter\u2019s quick intake of breath at this, as if the physical contact is a shock to his system. It doesn\u2019t make much impact on him at the moment. He just curls up in and tries to swallow around the pain. After a moment, Peter\u2019s arms come up to circle him, pulling him closer. He presses his forehead into Peter\u2019s neck and curls tighter, while Peter\u2019s hand rubs up and down his back.</p>\n<p>After a while, the worst of it passes. He takes a few deep, even breaths, and says, \u201cSorry.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter gives a little shrug against Stiles\u2019 cheek, and says, \u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles accepts that, and he starts to pull away, but Peter\u2019s arms around him cling tighter for a second too long before letting him go. Stiles settles back into his embrace without saying anything. He realizes that he never really sees anyone touch Peter, not even Derek. He\u2019s not sure about how tactile werewolves really are \u2013 some of what he\u2019s read suggests that touch is a part of hierarchy, but other websites decry that as romantic nonsense \u2013 but Peter\u2019s a person, too. It would be normal for him to crave contact.</p>\n<p>Peter doesn\u2019t say anything, and the silence, so natural and comfortable, is a blessed relief. It isn\u2019t a black hole that he feels an intense need to fill. It\u2019s just quiet. He relaxes more heavily against Peter\u2019s shoulder while Peter\u2019s fingers idly wander over the back of his neck.</p>\n<p>Nearly ten minutes have gone by before Peter finally says, \u201cAre you hungry?\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles has noticed that Peter\u2019s go-to strategy when Stiles seems upset is to try to feed him. He wonders if that has to do with being a werewolf, too, if feeding him makes Peter feel better. So it\u2019s with some reluctance that he says, \u201cNot really.\u201d But he squirms a little to make himself more comfortable and turn so he can see the TV. \u201cHey, pull up Hulu, the newest episode of The Good Place is up.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSure,\u201d Peter says, reaching for the remote. He doesn\u2019t tell Stiles to move, so Stiles doesn\u2019t. A few minutes later, they\u2019re both laughing at the show, and things seem okay, or at least as okay as they can be.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>~ ~ ~ ~</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Stiles glances up as the front door to the house opens, and waves to his father as he comes in. \u201cHey, Dad. Rough day?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo more or less than usual.\u201d Sheriff Stilinski takes off his shoes and hangs his gun holster on the usual hook. He\u2019s frowning slightly as he walks over to the table. \u201cBut there are a few things we need to discuss.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles has to squelch the immediate urge to run for the hills. \u201cUh, sure. What\u2019s up?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou weren\u2019t home last night,\u201d Noah says, leaning back in his chair. He\u2019s slouching, which is good, but his arms are folded over his chest, which is bad.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, Dad, I was at Scott\u2019s,\u201d Stiles says.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, you were not,\u201d Noah says. \u201cYou have not been at Scott for most if not all of the nights you had told me you were going to Scott\u2019s. I know this, because I saw him last night, and he is an exceptionally bad liar.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh.\u201d Stiles makes a mental note to thank Scott for at least trying to cover for him, and realizes this is why Scott had texted him that morning, asking where he had been the previous night. He\u2019s glad he had lied and said he was over at Derek\u2019s loft, rather than saying he was at home. Scott had accepted that, although he\u2019s probably going to have a boatload of questions the next time they see each other. \u201cUh, yeah, so. What happened is \u2013 \u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNope, stop.\u201d Noah holds up a hand. \u201cI know the face you make when you\u2019re concocting some story to tell me. I\u2019d like to know where you were, Stiles, but I\u2019m not going to make you tell me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles blinks. \u201cUh. What? You\u2019re not?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo. You want to know why?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah . . .\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBecause whatever it is you\u2019re doing, it\u2019s helping you.\u201d Noah leans against the table, looking at his son earnestly. \u201cI know how much you\u2019ve been hurting, kid. I also know that you didn\u2019t want to talk to me about it. Maybe you thought I wouldn\u2019t understand, or that I\u2019d be upset. Or maybe you were just being a teenager. But I knew you were hurting. How could you not be?\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles looks away, fiddling with his pencil.</p>\n<p>\u201cBut I know that lately, you\u2019ve been feeling better. You\u2019ve been talking more, you\u2019ve been telling me about the random stuff you learn on Wikipedia, you\u2019ve been sleeping better \u2013 on the nights you\u2019ve been home. You\u2019ve put some weight back on and you\u2019re playing lacrosse again. I know that things aren\u2019t perfect, that you\u2019re still having bad dreams and trouble in class. But you\u2019re better. If you want to tell me where you\u2019ve been going, I\u2019d love to listen. But if you don\u2019t feel like you can, I\u2019m not going to push.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles has to swallow the lump in his throat, wiping at his eyes impatiently. \u201cThanks, Dad.\u201d</p>\n<p>Noah nods. \u201cThe reason I\u2019m bringing it up is because someone was killed last night,\u201d he says, and Stiles\u2019 head whips up. \u201cAn omega werewolf. Decapitated. It might be an isolated incident. I\u2019ve talked to Derek about it. I won\u2019t ask where you\u2019re going, but I need to know that you\u2019re safe, that you\u2019re not wandering the forest or sitting at Allison\u2019s grave where you\u2019d be vulnerable.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, I . . .\u201d Stiles realizes that he actually wants to tell him. He\u2019s so sick of lies and secrets. The problem is, his father is almost guaranteed to freak out. He doesn\u2019t know Peter the way Stiles does. <em>Nobody</em> knows Peter the way Stiles does. \u201cI mean, I\u2019m safe. I\u2019m at a friend\u2019s place.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou promise?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, Dad, I promise.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Noah reaches out and squeezes his shoulder. \u201cYou know you can talk to me about anything, right?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah. Well, no, not really.\u201d Stiles winces. \u201cI mean, I <em>am</em> still a teenager. But, uh . . . I\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t come to you when I was so messed up. I wanted you to think I was okay. And I know that you would\u2019ve been happier with me actually <em>being</em> okay, instead of not being okay but pretending, but . . .\u201d He has to struggle for composure. \u201cSometimes I feel like . . . I cause you so much trouble. I didn\u2019t want to keep piling it on.\u201d</p>\n<p>Noah nods slowly. He\u2019s silent for a moment before he says, \u201cYou do cause me trouble. You are a sarcastic, unpredictable teenager with too much brains, not enough focus, and nowhere near as much respect for the law as I would prefer. Nobody has kids without thinking that they might cause trouble. Does having you in my life make things tough, and complicated, and sometimes scary? Of course. But I wouldn\u2019t give it up for anything, do you understand that? You are more important to me than anything or anyone else in the world. So if you ever stop for a second and think that I would be better off without you, I want you to know that you\u2019re wrong. Not just a little wrong. Epically wrong. Got it?\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles nods and wipes a few more tears away. \u201cOkay. Thanks, Dad.\u201d</p>\n<p>Noah gives his shoulder another squeeze. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI have a boyfriend,\u201d Stiles blurts out, which is kind of funny that <em>that\u2019s</em> the truth he manages to tell, when it\u2019s not even a truth at all. He has no idea how to describe what he has with Peter, but he\u2019s pretty sure that \u2018boyfriend\u2019 isn\u2019t really the right term for it.</p>\n<p>Noah blinks. \u201cShit, <em>that\u2019s</em> what you felt like you couldn\u2019t tell me? That you\u2019re gay?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, Dad, I \u2013 \u201d Stiles stops. \u201cWell, you know, there <em>was</em> that time you tried to tell me that I couldn\u2019t be gay based on how I dressed, which was pretty uncool of you, Dad.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhen was that?\u201d Noah asks, frowning.</p>\n<p>\u201cAt the club. The night the kanima attacked Danny. I said we were clubbing and you said \u2018you\u2019re not gay\u2019 and I said I could be, and you said \u2018not dressed like that\u2019.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, yeah. That\u2019s not what I meant, though. I see how it sounds, but \u2013 \u201d Noah flaps a hand at Stiles\u2019 clothes. \u201cI just meant, if you were trying to impress a boy, you would\u2019ve shown more care with your outfit. I watched you change six times before Lydia Martin\u2019s Christmas party your sophomore year. You don\u2019t just throw on the first thing that fits.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh!\u201d Stiles laughs. \u201cOkay, yeah. Point. I would not have worn that outfit to a gay club if I was actually looking for a date there. Uh, I\u2019m not gay, though. I\u2019m bi.\u201d His gaze darts anxiously at his father and he chews on his thumbnail despite the fact that intellectually, he\u2019s sure his father is fine with this.</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Noah says. \u201cAnd you have a boyfriend?\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles nods. \u201cHe\u2019s, uh. Not part of the clique, but he knows about supernatural stuff. I started talking to him when I was really messed up and he talked me through some of, you know, the worst of it. We\u2019re keeping it casual. I\u2019m not really . . . in a good headspace for anything serious right now. So mostly we watch movies and cuddle a lot, which, God, is <em>so</em> lame now that I\u2019m saying it out loud. But honestly, right now cuddling with him and watching movies is my favorite thing on earth.\u201d</p>\n<p>Noah is smiling, a truly fond smile. \u201cWhen I was seventeen, the summer before my senior year, your mother had a job at the diner downtown, as a waitress. And I went there every day and sat at the counter and just chatted with her in the down times. That was my favorite thing back then. So I get it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnything else you want to tell me about him?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t like him.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s made you feel a lot better. I like him already.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s just \u2018cause you haven\u2019t met him.\u201d</p>\n<p>Noah gives a snort of laughter. \u201cI\u2019ll take your word on it. I would like to meet him someday, though. Whenever you\u2019re ready.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>~ ~ ~ ~</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>About a week later, Stiles comes home to find that his father has bought some steaks to grill. Expensive steaks. He gives his father the side-eye and tries to find a polite way to ask about their financial state, given how worried he knows Noah has been.</p>\n<p>\u201cI see you looking at me, you know,\u201d Noah says, as he starts the grill. He shakes his head a little and says, \u201cWe\u2019re celebrating, because Eichen House has decided they\u2019re going to forgive the debt.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles blinks. \u201cForgive the \u2013 does that mean we don\u2019t owe them money anymore?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat is exactly what it means,\u201d Noah says. \u201cI guess some inspector is making them nervous about the treatment of people at their facility and they can\u2019t risk anyone causing a fuss right now. Go make a salad, okay? There\u2019s lemonade in the fridge.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAwesome,\u201d Stiles says. They eat dinner and talk about lacrosse and school, and afterwards he says, \u201cI\u2019m going to my boyfriend\u2019s for a while,\u201d a sentence which he\u2019s found he really likes to say now that he can.</p>\n<p>When he gets to Peter\u2019s, he\u2019s slouched on the sofa with T\u2019Challa on his lap, feet propped up on the coffee table and an air of smug satisfaction. \u201cOkay, what\u2019d you do?\u201d Stiles asks.</p>\n<p>\u201cMe?\u201d Peter asks, feigning innocence.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, you, you smug jerk,\u201d Stiles says, plopping onto the sofa next to him. \u201cI know that Eichen House didn\u2019t just magically decide we didn\u2019t owe them money anymore. It\u2019s not like my dad hadn\u2019t argued with them about charging us for my stay after everything that happened while I was there. They stuck to their guns until now. Why?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDid you know,\u201d Peter says, \u201cthat you don\u2019t actually need a lawyer to file a civil suit? As long as you know how to fill out the paperwork, you can represent yourself.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles gives him a sideways glance. \u201cOkay,\u201d he says. \u201cSo you sued Eichen House?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI actually just threatened to sue them. After stealing your records and the security footage.\u201d Peter gives a toothy grin. \u201cThey were really quite unhappy that I had those things. I asked them what they thought a jury would think of your stay there, and if they realized they could face criminal charges for administering a drug a doctor had not prescribed \u2013 the Haldol \u2013 which had resulted in injury to one of their other patients. He\u2019s not dead, by the way \u2013 the boy that the nogitsune controlled.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s not?\u201d Stiles breathes a sigh of relief. \u201cGod, there\u2019s so much about that whole thing that I don\u2019t remember. I really thought I had killed him.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, you only knocked him out \u2013 and I use the term \u2018you\u2019 loosely, since it wasn\u2019t really you at all. You also didn\u2019t have sex with Malia, by the way. You passed out around second base.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, thank God,\u201d Stiles says. \u201cWait, how do you know that?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat place was covered in security cameras, Stiles. Almost everything that happened there was caught on tape.\u201d Peter shrugs a little. \u201cIt seemed like it was troubling you, and it was easy to take care of. Eichen House will never close \u2013 the supernatural prison is too crucial to the area \u2013 but they also definitely <em>don\u2019t</em> want to be dragged into the spotlight. They\u2019d have to spends tens of thousands of dollars on lawyer for a case that they almost certainly wouldn\u2019t win, and it just wasn\u2019t worth it to them to continue to pursue it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThanks,\u201d Stiles says. \u201cReally, thank you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d Peter goes back to his book.</p>\n<p>Stiles ponders all of this for a moment before he says, \u201cHey, can I ask you something?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou can always ask.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMalia . . . she\u2019s your daughter, right?\u201d Stiles says, and Peter nods. \u201cIsn\u2019t that weird for you? I mean, do you want to get to know her? Do you remember her mom, what happened to her? Is her mom still around?\u201d Now that he\u2019s started asking the questions, he can\u2019t seem to stop. \u201cWhy did Talia take the memory of her from you? Why was she adopted out instead of just letting you and her mom raise her?\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter sighs. \u201cAre you done?\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles shrugs. \u201cI guess. Just . . . tell me whatever you want to tell me about her.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd if I don\u2019t want to talk about it?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll still be curious but I\u2019ll have to shut up about it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter gives a snort of laughter. \u201cAs for why we didn\u2019t raise her, to the best of my recollection, I was around your age when she was born. I\u2019m not even the paternal sort <em>now</em>; I definitely wouldn\u2019t have been in a position to raise a child when I was seventeen. I don\u2019t remember her mother very well, but the fact that Malia is a were-coyote means I know who it was, a girl I dated named Corinne, who was also a were-coyote. Wolves and coyotes typically don\u2019t get along; there are pack politics and territory issues, so it was a bit of a Romeo and Juliet sort of thing. By far the safest and least controversial thing to do with the child was to give it to mundane parents. I\u2019m guessing that one or both of us kicked up a fuss and that\u2019s why Talia took our memories of the child.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles mulls all that over for a minute before saying, \u201cThat\u2019s just a really horrible thing to do.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, yes and no,\u201d Peter says. \u201cI\u2019m sure Talia had the child\u2019s best interests in mind, and I was, shall we say, stubborn at that age. So I can see why she did it, even if I don\u2019t like it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI get that, but it\u2019s like she didn\u2019t trust you to listen to reason.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course not.\u201d Peter looks amused. \u201cThat\u2019s the way Talia was. She knew best, period, end of story. If she couldn\u2019t get her way by going through the obstacles, she would go around them. And that, of course, assumes that she didn\u2019t try to reason with me and I resisted her explanations, which remains very possible.\u201d He\u2019s quiet for a minute. \u201cI hate the fact that she did that, that she took my daughter away from me, that she took my <em>choices</em> away from me. But she\u2019s dead. It doesn\u2019t matter now.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles nods, pulling his knees up to his chest while he thinks all this over. \u201cSo what now?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIf Malia was an orphan, if she was living on the streets, I would take her in and do my best to be her father,\u201d Peter says. \u201cBut she\u2019s not. She has a father who loves her very much, who raised her, who takes care of her \u2013 eight years of living as a coyote notwithstanding, which neither he nor I can be blamed for. It\u2019s better if I don\u2019t interfere. As I said, I\u2019m not the paternal sort. I\u2019ve never really wanted children. So it\u2019s fine. I\u2019ll keep an eye on her and help out if needed.\u201d He frowns slightly and adds, \u201cI did send some tutors over, since some moron decided that they could just drop her back into high school as if she hadn\u2019t spent eight years living in a forest. I think Mr. Tate was confused, but I had them tell him it was part of a program the state sponsored for children who had been abducted or had their schooling interrupted in some other way. He believed that. Not a suspicious man, apparently.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles realizes he\u2019s smiling. \u201cYou\u2019re such a marshmallow.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI beg your pardon,\u201d Peter says, affronted.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou <em>are</em>,\u201d Stiles says, laughing. \u201cYou\u2019re so soft and gooey on the inside. I might be the only person in the world who knows that, but I\u2019m sure as hell never going to let you forget it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter sighs. \u201cI suppose it\u2019s too late to convince you of anything else, even if I reminded you of all the people I killed.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThey deserved it,\u201d Stiles says, shrugging. \u201cWell, except Laura. And your nurse.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI didn\u2019t kill Jennifer,\u201d Peter says, then amends, \u201cWell, not Jennifer Morrison, anyway.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles blinks. \u201cThere\u2019s a Jennifer you <em>did</em> kill? I don\u2019t \u2013 oh, <em>that\u2019s</em> what happened to Jennifer Blake. Okay, cool. No complaints here, since she tried to kill my dad and everything. But seriously, you didn\u2019t kill your nurse? You had her body in the trunk of your car.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI had her body in the trunk of <em>her</em> car,\u201d Peter says. \u201cAnd no, I didn\u2019t kill her. She had her issues, obviously. A substantial drug problem. Yes, I manipulated her, convinced her to help me. I\u2019ll make no bones about that. She became obsessed with the idea that we would run away together once I\u2019d gotten my revenge. I told her it wasn\u2019t going to happen, and she got upset, so I left. Next time I went to see her, she was dead of an overdose. I don\u2019t know if it was intentional or not.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo you . . . put her in the trunk of her car?\u201d Stiles asks, trying not to look as dubious as he feels.</p>\n<p>\u201cI needed a car. Hers was available. But if someone found her body, they\u2019d be looking for her car. So yes, I put the body in the trunk.\u201d Peter sighs. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t my finest moment, and I\u2019m not exactly proud of it, but I also wasn\u2019t precisely sane, so I did it. Still think I\u2019m a marshmallow?\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles shrugs. \u201cSometimes I really think of you as two people, you know? The real you, and the crazy guy who did all that stuff back then.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter shakes his head. \u201cThat\u2019s wrong, Stiles, and it\u2019s dangerous, too. Everything I did back then was me. Was I a bit unhinged? Sure. But it wasn\u2019t a Dr. Jekyll, Mr. Hyde sort of situation. It was me. I murdered people, I stalked and tormented your friends. I\u2019m capable of monstrous things if I think they\u2019re justified, and I have no delusions about the fact that my ideas of justified and other peoples\u2019 ideas might not match. Never, ever forget that.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles isn\u2019t sure what to say to all of that. He knows that Peter means every word, but he still can\u2019t help but think that after six years of unimaginable pain and solitude, he could have been fully in control of his actions. The fact that Peter did horrible things should matter to him, but the fact that Peter has been so kind to him matters, too. Finally, he says, \u201cOkay, but . . . if Jennifer Blake had killed my dad, I would have done things every bit as bad as you did, or worse. So maybe you\u2019re not a marshmallow. But I don\u2019t think you\u2019re as terrible as you seem to think you are.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo?\u201d Peter looks faintly amused. \u201cWhatever you say, Stiles.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>~ ~ ~ ~</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Having the weight of the financial problems off makes Stiles realize exactly how much it had been stressing him out. He\u2019s sure that his father would be annoyed by this, since he had repeatedly told Stiles it wasn\u2019t his problem and not to worry about it. Even so, he finds himself far more willing to buy things out of the school vending machines and treat himself to a new book or movie with his own pocket money.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019d ask where you get money, but . . .\u201d Peter says, when Stiles shows up at his place with a copy of Spider-Man: Homecoming.</p>\n<p>\u201cWriting papers online,\u201d Stiles says, immediately and without shame. \u201cIt\u2019s a real racket. I get a bonus if they get an A.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course you do,\u201d Peter says, his mouth curving in an amused smile.</p>\n<p>His friends can clearly tell that he\u2019s feeling better, too, because they seem more comfortable around him. They don\u2019t hang out as much as they used to, but they <em>do</em> hang out, and he even goes to the spring fling with Lydia, just as friends. He wonders what will happen once summer starts, when they want to do stuff and he just wants to hang out at Peter\u2019s every day.</p>\n<p>Lacrosse season is in full swing, so he\u2019s getting plenty of exercise even though he hates all the running. With effort, he manages to convince Scott that he shouldn\u2019t hold himself back when Stiles is groaning and gasping at the back of the team. Scott being team captain is important to him, and Stiles doesn\u2019t want to mess that up for him. Plus, if he doesn\u2019t have to put in as much effort, he enjoys it more, just jogging on the trails outside the school without caring too much what his time will be.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s trotting along on one of these days when he catches up with Garrett, who\u2019s sitting by the side of the trail, massaging his ankle. \u201cHey, man, you okay?\u201d Stiles asks.</p>\n<p>\u201cJust twisted my ankle,\u201d Garrett says. \u201cI\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles doesn\u2019t really like Garrett, but there are rules about this sort of thing, so he says, \u201cC\u2019mon, I\u2019ll give you a hand. You shouldn\u2019t just languish in the forest.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThanks,\u201d Garrett says. Stiles extends a hand and pulls him to his feet. He takes a step back as he does so, to give Garrett more room, and half-trips over a branch. It ends up saving his life, as he stumbles backwards and the knife Garrett thrusts towards his stomach ends up only tearing a shallow wound in his side.</p>\n<p>\u201cOw, what the hell!\u201d Stiles sputters, not realizing what had happened at first. Then he sees the knife, and takes another few steps backwards as Garrett slashes forward again. \u201cThe fuck, dude!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re pretty quick,\u201d Garrett says, grinning at him. \u201cWhat are you, anyway? You\u2019re not a werewolf. Figured you had to be, since you hang out with McCall all the time, but guess not.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUh, no,\u201d Stiles says, holding one hand to his sweatshirt, where blood is starting to soak through. He glances down at the wound through the gap in the fabric and sees a sticky yellow substance. Some sort of werewolf poison, probably, from what Garrett had said. \u201cWhy the fuck did you just stab me?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy do you think?\u201d Garrett asks, advancing on him again. Stiles keeps retreating, wondering where he can get a weapon. He doesn\u2019t have a lot of options, and he doubts he can outrun Garrett. He\u2019s seen him at the sprints.</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you a hunter?\u201d Stiles asks warily, as he takes steps backwards. \u201cBecause I know you guys aren\u2019t supposed to kill humans, and all jokes about being an abominable snowman aside, I check out.\u201d</p>\n<p>Garrett shrugs. \u201cI thought the list was only supernaturals, but hey, maybe I was wrong.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cList? What \u2013 \u201d</p>\n<p>Garrett doesn\u2019t let him finish the question. Stiles has to duck another blow, and since trying to get away isn\u2019t working, he grabs Garrett\u2019s wrist in both hands as he strikes. They struggle for a few minutes. Garrett\u2019s strong, but Stiles isn\u2019t exactly a weakling anymore. He tries to pry the knife out of Garrett\u2019s hand, closing his hand on the blade and wincing in pain.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey!\u201d a blessedly familiar voice shouts, as Scott comes over the rise to see what\u2019s going on. \u201cLet him go!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCarefully, Scotty, he\u2019s got some sort of poison on his knife!\u201d Stiles shouts.</p>\n<p>That\u2019s the least of Scott\u2019s concerns. Garrett hasn\u2019t let Stiles go; instead, a young woman drops out of a tree behind Scott and throws a wire over his head. It glows bright red, and for a moment Stiles can smell burning flesh as the wire cuts into Scott\u2019s throat. Then he grabs it in one hand, pulling it away, his eyes even more crimson than the thermal wire.</p>\n<p>\u201cHoly shit,\u201d the woman gasps, as Scott yanks the wire out of her hand and then throws it aside. She takes a few steps back as Scott snarls at her, and her defensive pose does absolutely nothing against him as he picks her up and throws her across the clearing.</p>\n<p>\u201cViolet!\u201d Garrett shouts. Stiles takes advantage of his momentary distraction, slamming his forehead against the bridge of Garrett\u2019s nose. Garrett yelps and staggers backwards, leaving the knife in Stiles\u2019 bloody hands.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d Scott asks, jogging over. Violet isn\u2019t moving, and within a bare second, Scott has Garrett\u2019s arms yanked up behind his back and his body pinned to the ground. When Stiles nods, Scott looks at the two assassins and says, \u201cYou\u2019d better call your dad.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah.\u201d It takes Stiles three tries to get his phone to unlock, since his hands are covered in blood. He manages to dial and briefly explain the situation to his father, and a few minutes later, the police and an ambulance are there. Stiles wants to go to the station, but his father insists he go in the ambulance after the EMT looks at the wounds and says he\u2019ll need stitches.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s over an hour later, and they\u2019re almost done with him, when his father shows up at the hospital. \u201cSo?\u201d Stiles demands, and his father gives him a weary but amused look. \u201cHey, no more secrets. We both agreed.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe did,\u201d Noah says, raising his hands in surrender. \u201cGarrett and Violet aren\u2019t talking, but it looks like they\u2019re professionals. We found a bunch of stuff in their car. And when we got their phone unlocked, we found this \u2018list\u2019 that they were talking about. A list of names and dollar amounts. Plenty of known supernaturals \u2013 Scott, Kira, Derek, et cetera.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles watches as Melissa continues to bandage his hands. \u201cI\u2019m on there?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah. Best we can figure is, someone doesn\u2019t realize that you and the nogitsune were separate.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWho else is on there?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cA lot of people. Almost a hundred names, total. We\u2019ll run them down, make sure they\u2019re all forewarned about whatever new type of hunter this is. It includes the man who was decapitated \u2013 presumably with that thermal wire that Violet uses \u2013 and a girl who was found dead a few days ago.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles frowns. \u201cYou guys didn\u2019t tell me about that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe were hoping we wouldn\u2019t have to,\u201d Noah says, and Stiles\u2019 frown deepens. \u201cOkay, okay. We should have told you. I think we\u2019ve all been a little <em>too</em> careful with you. If you\u2019d known that Demarco\u2019s death wasn\u2019t an isolated incident, you probably wouldn\u2019t have let Scott outdistance you by that much during the run.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Stiles says. \u201cI mean, at least we caught them, but . . . is there any way to trace the list?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNot that I see, but there may be a way to trace the payments the two of them have gotten so far. So we\u2019ll work on that. You, stay safe, don\u2019t go out alone. Okay?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Stiles wonders how he\u2019ll manage to go to Peter\u2019s without people knowing if he\u2019s not supposed to go out by himself, then figures that as long as he drives straight to Peter\u2019s and doesn\u2019t get out of the car, he\u2019ll probably be fine. \u201cYou be careful, too. Your name isn\u2019t on that list, is it?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo. But I\u2019ll be careful.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p>\n<p>Noah reaches out and tousles Stiles\u2019 hair, then leaves, saying he has a lot of work to do and not to wait up for him. When Stiles is released, Scott is waiting for him. \u201cHey, you okay? I\u2019ll take you home.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMy Jeep\u2019s still at the school,\u201d Stiles says.</p>\n<p>Scott shrugs. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be driving with your hands like that. I can pick you up for school for a few days.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Stiles says, since there isn\u2019t really anyway he can argue. To be fair, he\u2019s not sure how he would drive with his hands numb and bandaged anyway. Scott drops him off at home and then says he wants to go check on Kira and talk to Derek about identifying some of the other people on the list. \u201cI could come with you,\u201d Stiles says.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, man, you rest up. You\u2019ve had enough of a day,\u201d Scott says. They hug briefly, awkwardly, before Scott leaves.</p>\n<p>Stiles sinks onto the sofa and sighs. He takes his phone back out and studies it. He has Peter\u2019s number, but he\u2019s never actually called it, always just going over whenever he feels the need. He taps the screen a few times. Peter picks up a moment later. \u201cHey, it\u2019s me,\u201d Stiles says. \u201cI was gonna come over later but I can\u2019t, I don\u2019t have a car.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat happened to Roscoe?\u201d Peter asks.</p>\n<p>\u201cNothing, but I didn\u2019t drive him home and now I\u2019m stuck here and \u2013 ugh, it\u2019s a long story. Apparently there are some supernatural bounty hunters wandering around.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, I heard. Derek called me. I\u2019m only worth five million, which I think is insulting. Derek is worth fifteen! In what world is Derek three times the werewolf I am?\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles sniggers at Peter\u2019s pettiness. \u201cI wonder how much I\u2019m worth.\u201d</p>\n<p>He can practically hear Peter\u2019s sudden snap to attention. \u201cYou\u2019re on that list?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, that\u2019s why I\u2019m stuck at home. One of them tried to kill me during lacrosse practice. Scott took care of it; he was super badass. But I tried to get the knife away from him and my hand got cut up, so I had to get stitches. Anyway, long story short, Scott drove me home and my Jeep is still at the school.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you alone?\u201d Peter asks.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, but I\u2019ll be fine, the doors are all locked \u2013 \u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m coming over. Don\u2019t leave.\u201d Peter hangs up without another word.</p>\n<p>\u201cOoooookay,\u201d Stiles says to his phone, rolling his eyes. He surfs Reddit for a few minutes before the back door opens and Peter comes in. \u201cI\u2019d ask when you copied my keys but that\u2019s just doomed for failure, isn\u2019t it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMm hm.\u201d Peter is frowning as he scents the air. \u201cYou\u2019re hurt.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI <em>told</em> you I was hurt. Cut up my hand getting the knife away from him, remember? Plus he kind of, uh, stabbed me a little.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter snarls. \u201cStabbed you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOnly a little! It\u2019s a few inches long and shallow. It\u2019s stitched up and I\u2019ll be good as new. Geez, don\u2019t get all fussy over a few stab wounds.\u201d Stiles sees that Peter is looking more annoyed at him and decides to change the subject. \u201cAnyway, they got totally arrested and my Dad\u2019s going to throw all the books at them, so you don\u2019t have to come baby-sit me. I\u2019m fine.\u201d</p>\n<p>At this, Peter shakes his head. \u201cWith bounties in the millions, they were the first of many. And you\u2019re a high priority target. I called Derek on the way here to get the list of bounties, which he got from your father. You\u2019re worth twenty million.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cJesus!\u201d Stiles feels like he\u2019s been punched in the gut. \u201cTwenty <em>million</em>?\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter nods. \u201cSecond only to Scott, who\u2019s worth twenty-five.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy the fuck am I at the top of the list?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPresumably because whoever put it together doesn\u2019t realize that you and the nogitsune are not the same entity. Which says something interesting about them \u2013 whoever they are, they\u2019re not wholly versed in the supernatural. I\u2019m not sure how they would have put the list together. It\u2019s got about a hundred names on it, and there are ten times that many supernatural beings living in this area. The Nemeton draws them in like moths to flames.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles nods, thinking this over. \u201cSo they picked ones that had been in the news lately, metaphorically speaking.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd in some cases identified one, which led them to others. Satomi Ito is a well-known alpha, and they\u2019ve identified nearly all of her pack members.\u201d Peter gives a little shrug. \u201cThe nogitsune made quite a splash when it was impersonating you, so it doesn\u2019t surprise me that you\u2019re a high value target. But I\u2019m not going to let you sit at home alone when all this is going on.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLook, I won\u2019t argue with you for tonight because I\u2019d rather hang out than fight, but you can\u2019t spend every second with me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI won\u2019t try. I\u2019m sure you\u2019re safe as houses when Scott and Derek are around. Just don\u2019t go off alone.\u201d Peter takes out his phone. \u201cHungry? I\u2019ll order us some dinner.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles throws in the towel. \u201cSure, why not.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>~ ~ ~ ~</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Stiles frequently falls asleep on Peter\u2019s sofa, partly because it\u2019s one of the most comfortable sofas he\u2019s ever experienced. But he hardly ever sleeps the night through. He\u2019s always been a light sleeper, and it\u2019s worse in unfamiliar environments. Not only that, but T\u2019Challa has a habit of jumping up onto his feet in the middle of the night.</p>\n<p>When that happens, he knows it\u2019ll be a while before he falls back to sleep, if he manages to at all. Usually when he falls asleep, it\u2019s while the TV is still on and Peter is there on the sofa with him. In the middle of the night, when it\u2019s dark and silent and he\u2019s alone, it\u2019s much more difficult. He doesn\u2019t like to turn the TV back on because he doesn\u2019t want to wake Peter, so he\u2019ll put on music on his phone with his headphones on, and eventually fall back to sleep.</p>\n<p>Just as he\u2019s fumbling for his phone, he hears a noise from the bedroom. He\u2019s momentarily frozen with fear, but then realizes what it has to be. He gets up from the sofa and edges cautiously into the bedroom. Peter leaves the door open, so the cat can come and go.</p>\n<p>Peter\u2019s gotten the sheets wrapped tightly around himself, his body twitching slightly as one hand grips at the blanket. His eyes are squeezed shut, and there\u2019s sweat beading on his forehead.</p>\n<p>Stiles\u2019 immediate impulse is to reach out and shake him awake, but he knows that would be a bad idea. Peter might not be an alpha anymore, but he\u2019s still a werewolf. He could snap Stiles like a twig if he\u2019s startled. After a moment\u2019s thought, he jogs into the bathroom and fills a cup with water. He throws it onto Peter from about six feet away.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s not far enough. The next thing Stiles knows, he\u2019s pinned up against the wall with Peter\u2019s hand around his throat. Peter\u2019s eyes are gleaming bright blue, mouth twisted into a snarl.</p>\n<p>\u201cPeter, it\u2019s me,\u201d Stiles chokes out. Peter\u2019s claws dig in for a brief moment, and Stiles reaches up instinctively, not to try to pry them off, but to touch Peter\u2019s cheek. He can\u2019t say what prompts him to do it. He traces his thumb over Peter\u2019s cheekbone, keeping his touch gentle. Peter gives a small shudder, and the gleam fades out of his eyes. \u201cHey. It\u2019s me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFuck.\u201d Peter releases him and stumbles a few feet away, sinking down on the edge of the bed. \u201cDid I hurt you?\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles gingerly touches his throat, then says, \u201cJust a few scrapes. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m bleeding.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have woken me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t just leave you like that,\u201d Stiles says. \u201cI have bad dreams too, you know.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI know. Still, it was dangerous.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles shrugs. \u201cI guess I\u2019m not afraid of much anymore.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cA healthy attitude, I\u2019m sure,\u201d Peter says.</p>\n<p>With a snort of laughter, Stiles sits down next to him, close enough so his thigh is pressed against Peter\u2019s. After a moment, he asks, \u201cDo you dream about the fire?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSometimes,\u201d Peter says. \u201cBut usually not. I dream about what happened afterwards. About lying in the hospital, unable to move, unable to speak. It was . . . such a strange, frightening feeling. Claustrophobic. I wish I couldn\u2019t remember it, but I remember every minute. The pain was unimaginable, but the isolation was worse.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI can see that,\u201d Stiles says. \u201cHell, I\u2019d have gone nuts after six <em>days</em> of that, let alone six years.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, I did,\u201d Peter says, with a dry smile. \u201cAnd then I went another five years and three hundred fifty-nine days more nuts. Werewolves aren\u2019t meant to be alone like that. The healing, the pain, I could have handled, but being alone . . .\u201d</p>\n<p>Without thinking, Stiles reaches out and twines his fingers through Peter\u2019s. \u201cYou\u2019re not alone anymore.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter leans over, resting his head in the crook of Stiles\u2019 neck. \u201cYou don\u2019t even tell your friends that you\u2019re coming here.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles blinks at him, a little startled. \u201cWell, no, granted, but that\u2019s just they\u2019d make a huge fuss and I didn\u2019t feel like dealing with it. Does it bother you? Because if it does, I\u2019ll tell them. Hell, I\u2019ll hang up posters around Beacon Hills. If they want to say I shouldn\u2019t be around you, they can say it to my face, and I\u2019ll fucking throw down.\u201d</p>\n<p>That smile twitches at Peter\u2019s lips again. \u201cThat seems a bit excessive.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, \u2018cause you\u2019re such a model of restraint.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter gives a snort, and both of them end up laughing.</p>\n<p>\u201cC\u2019mon,\u201d Stiles says. \u201cMy mom always swore by cocoa and cartoons after a nightmare. You probably don\u2019t have anything as plebian as Swiss Miss in your kitchen, but I\u2019m sure we can find something that\u2019ll do.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>~ ~ ~ ~</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>After a week has passed and nobody else has tried to remove Stiles\u2019 head, everyone relaxes a little. Sheriff Stilinski hasn\u2019t had any luck tracing the payments, because they seem to have come in cash. It\u2019s not surprising, according to Peter. A lot of illegal activity results in cash payments. Stiles presumes he would know as well as anyone would.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhere did the people running this show even get all this money?\u201d Stiles wonders aloud, while Peter is making him dinner on a Friday night.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s an interesting question, but there are lots of possibilities,\u201d Peter says. \u201cPlenty of people involved in the supernatural world have under the table activities. Arms dealing, primarily. That\u2019s how the Argents made their money.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cRight, right, the Wal-Mart of guns,\u201d Stiles says, nodding. \u201cOkay. But why would someone like that be hiring bounty hunters instead of doing the dirty work themselves?\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter shrugs. \u201cI don\u2019t pretend to understand the mind of <em>every</em> monster. Human or non-human. Only my own.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe gonna have to have that talk again?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t feel the need to have any talk about that at all, no.\u201d Peter half turns with a spoonful of the sauce he\u2019s making. \u201cToo much ginger?\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles takes the spoon and licks it off. \u201cNuh uh. Perfect.\u201d So perfect that he wants to dive headfirst into the stir fry. \u201cHey, if you like to cook so much, why don\u2019t you ever cook for the others?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat others?\u201d Peter asks.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, Derek, mostly,\u201d Stiles says.</p>\n<p>Peter shrugs. \u201cDerek doesn\u2019t want me around, so I try not to inflict my presence on him when it isn\u2019t necessary.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI guess, but . . .\u201d Stiles searches for the right question. \u201cNone of the others even know you like to cook, or that you have a cat, or love Star Wars. It\u2019s like you\u2019re a totally different person around them.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, and that person is one who can tolerate being around them without strangling Scott with his own T-shirt,\u201d Peter says, and Stiles gives a snort of laughter despite himself. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t feel the need to \u2018share\u2019 with him, or any of his motley little crew. Why should I?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou share with me,\u201d Stiles points out.</p>\n<p>\u201cBecause you actually spend time with me voluntarily, and expressed interest in getting to know me as a human being, rather than simply calling me every time you wanted to take advantage of my expertise.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, you know. You can\u2019t exactly blame the others for not wanting to be besties.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t blame them. I even provide said expertise when requested, as long as it\u2019s not too far out of my way or will put me in danger. But I\u2019m still not going to talk to them about Star Wars or ask their opinion what kind of curry I should make this weekend.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles thinks this over for a minute before deciding that it basically makes sense. \u201cDerek, though. I mean, he\u2019s your nephew, you clearly care about him an awful lot. I honestly have no idea if he likes Star Wars or not, but he probably wouldn\u2019t say no if you wanted to make him dinner.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter turns away from his food and gives Stiles an annoyed look. \u201cAre you being deliberately obtuse?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Stiles says, scowling.</p>\n<p>\u201cReally? Are you really going to sit there and try to convince me that you don\u2019t know why I\u2019m not just going to show up on Derek\u2019s doorstep and say \u2018hello, nephew, I brought you some lasagna!\u2019\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI just think that you could try actually repairing your relationship with him instead of \u2013 \u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI killed his sister!\u201d Peter snarls, his eyes flaring blue. \u201cHe will never forgive me for that, and I will not ask him to. Drop the subject, Stiles. Now.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles goes quiet. After a moment, he says, \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I just don\u2019t like \u2013 seeing you unhappy.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter\u2019s shoulders, which he\u2019s been holding tense, relax slightly. He turns back to the food so he doesn\u2019t have to look at Stiles and says, \u201cI\u2019ve made peace with the consequences of my actions, Stiles. I don\u2019t need you to \u2018fix\u2019 me. Now hand me that jar of sesame seeds.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles nods and does so, and Peter cooks in silence for a few minutes. Fortunately, the meal is almost done, and once they\u2019re eating, Stiles can talk about the food and some memories he has of how much his mother loved Chinese food. It diffuses the worst of the tension. Before long, they\u2019re talking about Lord of the Rings as if nothing out of the ordinary had happened.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>~ ~ ~ ~</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Scott mentions Peter\u2019s encounter with the mouthless assassin in passing, as if it\u2019s something that doesn\u2019t matter to him at all. Stiles, unfortunately, blurts out, \u201cThe fuck, is he okay?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat? Yeah, he\u2019s fine, he\u2019s like a fucking cockroach,\u201d Scott says, frowning at Stiles. \u201cDerek went to see him, and then he was going to talk to your dad about the fact that we\u2019ve got another bounty hunter in town.\u201d</p>\n<p>Now Stiles is distracted. \u201cWhose idea was it to get my dad involved in this? That\u2019s a terrible idea! Mouthless assassins with tomahawks, Scott!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCome on, man, your dad can handle himself, and Derek will be with him.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles scowls. \u201cEven so, I don\u2019t like it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNobody likes any of this, man. But your dad is the sheriff and he\u2019s been very, very clear about needing to be kept in the loop. Especially since you\u2019re on that list.\u201d Scott reaches out and squeezes Stiles\u2019 shoulder. \u201cWe\u2019re going to keep you safe, okay?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, I . . .\u201d Stiles heaves a sigh. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCome on, I\u2019ll take you home.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles would really much rather go to Peter\u2019s, but he doesn\u2019t want to say that to Scott, who will undoubtedly make a huge deal out of it. He\u2019s also not quite stupid enough to try to go there on his own, after Scott gets him home safely. He\u2019d get kidnapped or murdered or worse. So he sits at home, silently fuming. He thinks once or twice about calling Peter, but if he\u2019s injured, he doesn\u2019t want to bother him.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s late before his father gets home, and he looks tired but otherwise unscathed. \u201cWhat happened, are you okay?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m fine, Stiles,\u201d Noah says. \u201cEverything\u2019s fine.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMouthless guy?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTaken care of. How about we order a pizza?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAbsolutely not! If you\u2019re hungry, I\u2019ll make you a sandwich, with things that won\u2019t clog your arteries.\u201d Stiles sees his father giving him a fond smile and says, \u201cUgh, you baited me and I fell for it! I\u2019m making you a sandwich anyway. Then can I go to my boyfriend\u2019s, if the assassin is gone?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSure,\u201d Noah says, clearly amused. \u201cBut go straight there. No stops.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles makes the sandwich (turkey on wheat bread with low-fat mayo, which makes Noah roll his eyes) and then grabs the keys to the Jeep. He texts Peter to let him know that he\u2019s on his way over, but doesn\u2019t wait for a reply.</p>\n<p>The healing wound in Peter\u2019s chest is so awful-looking that Stiles barely even notices that he\u2019s shirtless. \u201cYikes, you look like hell,\u201d he says, taking in Peter\u2019s overall appearance. He\u2019s sprawled on the sofa, wearing only a pair of jeans, with an open bottle of whiskey. His eyes are red and swollen, so he\u2019s probably been crying, although Stiles knows he would never admit it. \u201cThat\u2019s from Tomahawk guy?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Peter\u2019s voice is a little hoarse. \u201cDerek had to burn the wolfsbane out.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGross.\u201d Stiles steps over and examines the wound more closely, the reddened, angry skin surrounding it. \u201cI know that I\u2019m not innocent in this particular matter, but people have got to stop setting you on fire.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter gives a little snort of laughter despite himself. \u201cI admit I\u2019m not a fan of it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHow long will it take to heal?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cA couple days. Burns are the slowest wounds for werewolves to heal, even now that the wolfsbane is out.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDoes it hurt?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cExcruciatingly, yes, thank you for asking.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI wish I could do that pain drain thing you guys do.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI wish you could, too.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles frowns. \u201cOkay, but if Derek burned the wolfsbane out, couldn\u2019t he do it? How long ago was that, how long does it last?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNot long. Only about an hour. Although in this case it\u2019s irrelevant, because he didn\u2019t do it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUgh.\u201d Stiles makes a mental note to kick Derek\u2019s ass next time he sees him. Maybe sign him up for some magazine subscriptions or have a bunch of pizzas delivered to his loft. \u201cFucking rude.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter glances over at him and says, \u201cI\u2019m not up to an argument about my relationship with my nephew, so don\u2019t start one.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles sighs but says, \u201cOkay,\u201d before sitting down on the sofa with Peter, nudging Peter\u2019s leg with his. \u201cIs the whiskey helping, at least?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo. And I don\u2019t even like the taste.\u201d Peter takes another swig. \u201cI just keep drinking it hoping that it\u2019ll do something.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles rolls his eyes and takes the bottle out of his hands. Peter lets him, so he stands up to put it away, then decides to order them some dinner. He peruses the take-out menus neatly pinned to Peter\u2019s fridge and calls over, \u201cI\u2019m ordering from Cho\u2019s whether you like it or not. You shouldn\u2019t be on your feet and moving around.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter\u2019s response is a rude noise, and Stiles wonders exactly how much of the whiskey he had imbibed, and if it was enough to actually get him tipsy. He orders their food and then comes back into the living room, rifling through Peter\u2019s movie collection before selecting Alien and putting it in the DVD player. Peter allows this without argument, and when Stiles flops onto the sofa and puts his feet in Peter\u2019s lap, he curls one hand around Stiles\u2019 calf.</p>\n<p>They\u2019re barely five minutes into the movie when Stiles\u2019 phone rings. He glances down at it and sees that it\u2019s Scott, and says, \u201cHang on,\u201d before hitting the button to accept the call. Peter gives him a somewhat sour look but pauses their movie regardless. \u201cHey, what\u2019s up?\u201d Stiles asks.</p>\n<p>\u201cUgh, I\u2019ve had the worst day,\u201d Scott says, with feeling, before telling him about how he had to help Derek dispose of the body of the Mute. He vents for several minutes about how Peter didn\u2019t have to kill him, how they had him disarmed and helpless, and how awful Peter is in general. Stiles watches Peter, who can clearly hear every word Scott says, looking at first amused but then annoyed as the rant goes on.</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay, Scotty, I\u2019m gonna interrupt you here,\u201d Stiles says, \u201cand ask what in God\u2019s name <em>you</em> were gonna do with a mouthless assassin.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat? I don\u2019t know, but we had him captured, we could \u2013 \u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPut him on trial for murder?\u201d Stiles asks. \u201cYou think a mouthless assassin would play well on the six o\u2019clock news?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Scott says, clearly aggravated, \u201cbut even so, he can\u2019t just kill whoever he wants.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDude, the thing put a tomahawk in his chest,\u201d Stiles says. \u201cPretty sure that killing it wasn\u2019t an overreaction. I mean, I know, you\u2019re against killing as a general rule, and as a general rule that\u2019s completely fine by me, but sometimes things just need killing, you know? And I\u2019m pretty sure \u2018mouthless monster who has committed multiple murders with a tomahawk\u2019 is one of those things.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, well, I\u2019m pretty sure Peter is one of those things, too,\u201d Scott says.</p>\n<p>Stiles\u2019 stomach goes cold at the idea of the idea of Peter having been killed, at the idea of suddenly not having Peter in his life. He only barely manages to squelch the instinctual snarl that wants to escape. \u201cOkay, I\u2019m not going to ask you to create a Peter Hale fanclub any time soon, but you know as well as I do that ninety percent of what he did was because he was nuts after the fire, so let\u2019s not throw stones, okay?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m just saying,\u201d Scott says, sounding pissed. \u201cHe might not be nuts now, but he\u2019s still a murderer.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay, sure,\u201d Stiles says, \u201cbut I still don\u2019t see anything wrong with him killing the Mute.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe can\u2019t just do that,\u201d Scott says. \u201cWe have to be <em>better</em> than that.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles wants to reply to that, but he\u2019s suddenly thinking back to the nogitsune, to its dark amusement, its certainty in the knowledge that the others would <em>never</em> kill Stiles, that they would never risk harming him. It could rely on that, even rely on them to <em>protect</em> it from the Oni, if it meant protecting Stiles. He has to take a deep breath, fighting back nausea. Wanting to end the conversation, he says, \u201cGreat, go . . . go be better, Scott. I\u2019ve gotta go.\u201d He hangs up and tosses the phone away, putting his head between his knees and concentrating on breathing. A moment later, he feels Peter\u2019s hand on his back, rubbing up and down his spine. He manages to choke out, \u201cI\u2019m okay.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMm hm,\u201d Peter says, his tone conveying an entire universe of skepticism.</p>\n<p>\u201cI just . . . sometimes I wonder, if they had just killed me as soon as they knew I was possessed, would Allison have survived?\u201d Stiles says. He half-expects Peter to tell him to shut the hell up, but he doesn\u2019t. \u201cI think of Chris Argent pointing his gun at me, so close to pulling the trigger. I wonder if he thinks about it, too, about how if he had killed me then, his daughter would still be alive. They had \u2013 they had plenty of chances. If they had killed me, it would have died with me. But they wouldn\u2019t.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course they wouldn\u2019t,\u201d Peter says. \u201cIn their shoes, you wouldn\u2019t have either.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not exactly a saint,\u201d Stiles says, trying to smile. \u201cI was willing to kill you. Hell, I was willing to kill Jackson, when he wouldn\u2019t own up to the fact that he was the kanima.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter shrugs. \u201cOkay. But would you have been willing to kill Allison?\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles\u2019 stomach turns. \u201cNo.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cEven if you knew you were putting your own life at risk, by trying to help her, cure her, rather than end the threat by killing her?\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles can\u2019t manage to choke the word out through his aching throat. After a moment, he just nods.</p>\n<p>\u201cThere you are then.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut Allison \u2013 Allison was <em>good</em>,\u201d Stiles chokes out. \u201cShe was a better person than I was. I \u2013 I should have been better, should have fought harder. I tried to fight against it but it was so hard. It killed innocent people and I couldn\u2019t stop it. Allison would have stopped it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou have no idea if that\u2019s true,\u201d Peter says, \u201cand everything we know about the nogitsune suggests that it isn\u2019t.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles hunches up tighter and says nothing.</p>\n<p>Peter gives him a minute, then says quietly, \u201cAllison\u2019s death was awful. It was <em>unfair</em>. So your mind struggles to find a way to prevent it. But even if we could change the past, there\u2019s no way to know what might have made it happen differently. You are not the nogitsune, Stiles. You didn\u2019t imprison it. You might have inadvertently fueled its release, but you only did that because Jennifer Blake was threatening to kill your father, and in that, Allison was just as culpable as you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut why me?\u201d Stiles manages. \u201cWhy did it choose me? There, there must have been something about me \u2013 \u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt chose you because you were a spark. That\u2019s all. You can\u2019t be held responsible for that, any more than Allison can be held responsible for <em>not</em> being a spark.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles stays curled up for a moment, struggling against the nausea. Finally, he manages to take a deep breath, and the tightness in his throat eases. \u201cIt\u2019s not fair.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s not. And survivor\u2019s guilt is a bitch. Trust me, I know that from intimate experience.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles glances over at him. \u201cDo you ever \u2013 stop wondering? Why you survived?\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter\u2019s quiet for a moment, before he shrugs and says, \u201cI haven\u2019t yet.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles knuckles a few tears out of his eyes. \u201cThanks for being honest,\u201d he says, and crawls into Peter\u2019s lap, resting his head against Peter\u2019s shoulder, careful not to touch the healing wound. Peter leans back against the cushions to give him a little more room. After a few moments, he picks up the remote and puts the movie back on.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>~ ~ ~ ~</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Stiles is more than a little surprised when he goes to the station school and finds that Scott is there, and is engaged in a debate with his father. He catches, \u201cBut that\u2019s not the point!\u201d as he comes into the office, and then Scott looks surprised to see him, and a little embarrassed. \u201cHey, I, uh, I thought you were going to go straight home.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles gives him a sideways look. \u201cI did go home. And then I came here, with his dinner.\u201d He holds up the brown paper bag, then adds, \u201cI put in some almonds. They\u2019re good for you, so eat them.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI like almonds,\u201d Noah says mildly.</p>\n<p>\u201cGood. So are you two gonna tell me what\u2019s going on?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s nothing \u2013 \u201d Scott starts.</p>\n<p>At the same time, Noah says, \u201cScott and I have been discussing your ability to protect yourself from the bounty hunters. We couldn\u2019t come to a compromise, so maybe we should just ask you. Would you rather carry a Taser or a gun?\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles frowns and says, \u201cDare I ask how many bounty hunters I haven\u2019t heard about?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFive,\u201d his father says. \u201cNone of them got near you, and three of them have been arrested. I don\u2019t think the other two plan on coming back. But since this isn\u2019t going to be settling down any time soon, and I can\u2019t keep you in a bubble, I want you to be able to defend yourself.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not allowed to carry a gun on school property,\u201d Stiles says, \u201cso I guess a Taser. Though, maybe also a gun. And I could just carry it when I\u2019m not in school.\u201d</p>\n<p>Noah studies him for a long moment, then nods and says, \u201cOkay. I\u2019ll take you down to the range and teach you how to use one.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cStiles,\u201d Scott says, his voice painfully awkward, \u201cI don\u2019t want you to have to carry a gun. Just let us protect you, okay?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLook, if someone tries to kill me and you\u2019re standing right there, sure, I\u2019ll let you take the lead on that,\u201d Stiles says, \u201cbut we aren\u2019t together twenty-four-seven. My dad\u2019s right; I should be able to protect myself.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay, but it\u2019s one thing to say that and another thing to do it,\u201d Scott says. \u201cEspecially after everything that\u2019s happened.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles frowns. \u201cWhat\u2019s that supposed to mean?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI just \u2013 I just want you to be okay, Stiles,\u201d Scott says earnestly.</p>\n<p>Noah reaches out and squeezes Stiles\u2019 shoulder. \u201cHe will be. Okay, Scott? I\u2019m going to talk to him, we\u2019ll make sure he\u2019s safe.\u201d</p>\n<p>It\u2019s clearly a dismissal, and although Scott is still clearly uncomfortable, he nods and accepts it. He gives Stiles a hug and then jogs out of the room. Stiles is left blinking at his retreating back, until he turns to his father and says, \u201cWhat the hell am I missing?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cApparently,\u201d Noah says, his voice carefully measured, \u201cyou said some things to Scott about the Mute that left him concerned. He\u2019s afraid that you\u2019d be willing to kill to protect yourself, or possibly jump too quickly to that option, and he doesn\u2019t want you to have to do that.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles feels his gut twist a little, with both anger and guilt. \u201cYeah, well, it\u2019s not like I <em>want</em> to. But Scott talks like nobody ever has to kill anybody, ever, like he doesn\u2019t live in a world full of magic and monsters.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCome on,\u201d Noah says, \u201clet\u2019s take a ride. We\u2019ll head down to the range.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFine,\u201d Stiles says, sighing, sure that he\u2019s now in for a lecture.</p>\n<p>Once they\u2019re in the car, his father says, \u201cI don\u2019t think you\u2019re entirely wrong about the Mute, you know. I\u2019m not sure what exactly we would have done if it had survived. And I realized after the fact that a lot of my opinion on what happened \u2013 and probably Scott\u2019s opinion, too \u2013 was colored by the fact that it was Peter Hale pulling the metaphorical trigger. I realized that if this thing had attacked Derek, or Scott, and they had killed it in response, I would have felt that was appropriate. So I don\u2019t really think it\u2019s wrong for Peter to have done so; we just all have a bit of a knee-jerk reaction to Peter.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, I guess. I mean. He did bad shit,\u201d Stiles admits. He plays with the hem of his shirt, thinking about what his father would think if he found out about his relationship with Peter. \u201cI dunno, though. I mean, he was getting revenge after his family was brutally murdered, which seems pretty fair, honestly.\u201d</p>\n<p>Noah glances at him and says, \u201cI think the desire for revenge is natural. And I know that neither of us can imagine what those six years were like for Peter. But we have a justice system for a reason. If he knew Kate Argent had killed his family, he should have told the police that, not murdered everyone involved.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Stiles agrees.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s not even going into what he did to Scott, to you and Lydia \u2013 he hurt innocent people, and that\u2019s never okay.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Stiles says again, realizing that he doesn\u2019t actually know why Peter did some of these things, beyond generic \u2018he was half out of his mind\u2019.</p>\n<p>\u201cBut that\u2019s besides the point,\u201d Noah says. \u201cAll I\u2019m saying is that if you have to kill someone to keep yourself alive, then I trust you to make that judgment call in the moment, and yes, I want you prepared and capable of using lethal force if necessary.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles folds his arms over his stomach and says, \u201cBut Scott doesn\u2019t.\u201d</p>\n<p>Noah sighs. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a reflection on his opinion of your character,\u201d he says. \u201cI think Scott just . . . wants to live in a world where killing is never necessary.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMust be nice there,\u201d Stiles mutters.</p>\n<p>His father surprises him by giving a snort of laughter. \u201cYeah, I bet it is,\u201d he says. \u201cBut Scott\u2019s had a pretty rough year, so let\u2019s just let him have it for now, okay? We\u2019ll cross that bridge if we get to it. Hopefully we\u2019ll figure out who\u2019s behind these bounty hunters and it won\u2019t even come up.\u201d</p>\n<p>They spend about an hour at the range, and by the time they leave, he\u2019s moderately decent at hitting the target. Of course, he\u2019s not even legally allowed to own a gun at his age, but Noah says they\u2019ll overlook that, given the circumstances. He gives him a thorough lecture on gun safety and then turns him loose on the world.</p>\n<p>Stiles heads over to Peter\u2019s. He\u2019s not there, so Stiles curls up on the sofa with T\u2019Challa, and turns the television on. Peter arrives about an hour later, with a few bags from one of the grocery stores he goes to. He says he\u2019s going to marinate some steaks.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey, can I ask you something?\u201d Stiles says, watching Peter chop garlic, and Peter gives his usual shrug. \u201cWhy did you bite Scott?\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter glances over at him, a glance that seems simultaneously amused at the question and puzzled as to why Stiles has chosen to ask it now. \u201cI knew that I wouldn\u2019t be able to take Kate on by myself, so having a couple betas was in my best interest.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay, yeah, but . . .\u201d Stiles thinks about this for a few moments. \u201cTrying to force him to do what you wanted? To kill people?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, it was a terrible decision,\u201d Peter says, without hesitation. \u201cI wasn\u2019t thinking clearly at all, and it backfired on me spectacularly, and I deserved it. It was a combination of stubbornness and ego, two of my least attractive traits. I hated the fact that some random, goody-two-shoes teenager I stumbled on in the woods was fighting back \u2013 and <em>winning.</em> So I dug my heels in and tried to pull it out, when a far smarter thing to do would\u2019ve been to give up on him and choose somebody else. Will you grab the Worchestershire Sauce from the fridge?\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles gives a little snort and goes to do so. \u201cHey, did you know that Worchestershire Sauce was invented by accident? Like, these guys had this stuff in a barrel for years and forgot about it, and when they found it they decided to try it, and it turned out that it tasted good.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cInteresting.\u201d Peter looks amused. \u201cAnd here I thought we were talking about <em>my</em> bad decisions.\u201d</p>\n<p>That makes Stiles laugh. \u201cYeah. You did some fucked up stuff back then.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI did. I don\u2019t deny it.\u201d Peter measures out the sauce carefully, and then reaches for his black pepper grinder. \u201cBut like I told you, I would have done just about anything to get to Kate. The morality of my actions was completely unimportant to me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you regret doing that stuff?\u201d Stiles asks, curious.</p>\n<p>Peter shrugs. \u201cI regret hurting Derek.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd Laura?\u201d Stiles prompts.</p>\n<p>Peter\u2019s hands tighten convulsively, and the pepper grinder shatters. Stiles blinks at him, as he looks down at the marinade, now full of splintered wood. He clears his throat and says, \u201cYes. And Laura.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou, uh . . .\u201d Stiles says, at a bit of a loss for words. \u201cDo you want me to . . .\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo.\u201d Peter\u2019s voice is harsh and abrupt. He picks up the bowl and dumps it into the sink, washing the sauce and the bits of wood down the drain. He sweeps the remains of the pepper grinder, along with all the pepper, into the trash, while Stiles watches. By the time he\u2019s finished doing that, he\u2019s composed. \u201cLet\u2019s order some take-out.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Stiles hesitates, then says, \u201cSorry. I shouldn\u2019t have brought it up. I know you don\u2019t like to \u2013 \u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine. Papa Gino\u2019s?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter gets on his phone and places an order, and by the time he\u2019s finished, he seems mostly back to normal, putting the marinade ingredients away and saying, \u201cSo they just found an old barrel of sauce in their basement and decided to try it?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, I guess so,\u201d Stiles says. \u201cBut if you think that\u2019s bad, wait until you hear about how artificial sweeteners were discovered . . .\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter gives a snort of laughter and says, \u201cAll right, let\u2019s hear it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>~ ~ ~ ~</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It\u2019s probably not normal for someone to survive being trapped in a car and burned alive, so after it happens to Jordan Parrish, the group puts their minds together to figure it out. It turns out he\u2019s a Hellhound, which certainly isn\u2019t what Stiles had expected. When he thinks \u2018Hellhound\u2019 he doesn\u2019t picture \u2018mild-mannered but slightly smart-mouthed deputy with cute green eyes\u2019. Deaton explains it, but to be honest Stiles has stopped listening because he\u2019s trying to remember something he had read about banshees.</p>\n<p>He finds the book he wants and practically runs the Jeep off the road in his haste to get to Peter\u2019s. He slams the book down in front of him and says, \u201cTell me if you think this would work.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter glances down at the text. A slight frown furrows his forehead, and then he says, \u201cObviously not, you don\u2019t have \u2013 \u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cA Hellhound?\u201d Stiles interrupts. \u201cYeah, I do. Deputy Parrish is one. We just found out.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter\u2019s frown deepens as he reads the text. Finally, he shakes his head. \u201cIt\u2019s far too risky.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cRisky?\u201d Stiles asks, his voice rising. \u201cWho the hell <em>cares</em>? We \u2013 we could bring Allison back! And, and Erica and Boyd \u2013 even Laura!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThere will be no bringing back of anyone,\u201d Peter says, slamming the book shut. \u201cBringing people back from the dead is immensely difficult.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThis from you?\u201d Stiles asks incredulously. \u201cYou literally did it to yourself!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, and it was possible because of a very, very specific set of circumstances, that I bit a banshee less than twenty-four hours before my death,\u201d Peter says. \u201cI don\u2019t recall Allison doing that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay, yeah, but this spell is something different, you have to see that,\u201d Stiles says. \u201cYou need all four parts. A banshee to channel the dead, a kitsune to start the heart, a Hellhound to carry the body, and a spark to act as the guide. We have all those four parts! I could do this, I could go across the barrier and bring people back!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cStiles, no!\u201d Peter shouts, and Stiles stares at him in shock. \u201cYou have no idea how many ways a spell like this could go wrong. You could open a door you can\u2019t close, you could bring across something that\u2019s <em>not</em> one of your friends. You could get stuck there, or lost there, because there\u2019s a fifth part I notice you\u2019re conveniently not mentioning: an anchor to keep the spark tethered to the living. Lydia could anchor you when you went looking for the nogitsune but she wouldn\u2019t be able to do it this time, if she\u2019s keeping the channel open, and it would have to be an incredibly strong bond \u2013 \u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLike a mating bond?\u201d Stiles asks, lifting his eyes to Peter\u2019s in challenge.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d Peter retorts. \u201cLike a mating bond. Which is something we don\u2019t have.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re \u2013 \u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNot mates, Stiles!\u201d Peter shouts. \u201cYou refused me. You were right to do it and I don\u2019t blame you. But only an alpha and a spark can be mates, and only if the alpha offers the Bite and the spark willingly accepts. We can\u2019t be mates anymore, not today, not tomorrow, quite possibly not ever. And while we\u2019re on the subject, if you were going to accept the mating bond <em>now</em>, just to do this, I wouldn\u2019t want it anyway.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou know what, fuck you!\u201d Stiles snaps. \u201cYou\u2019re only saying all of this because you don\u2019t want me bringing Laura back! Because you don\u2019t want to face her after what you did!\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter\u2019s mouth tightens. \u201cAnd you\u2019re only doing this because you still feel guilty about Allison\u2019s death, so what\u2019s your point?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s a hell of a lot more noble than what you\u2019re doing! Hiding from the possibility that we could get our friends back because you killed your own niece and you can\u2019t face up to that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re not thinking clearly, Stiles,\u201d Peter says, a little more quietly. \u201cYou don\u2019t have any idea what a spell like this could do \u2013 you could literally tear apart the fabric of reality because <em>you</em> can\u2019t face the fact that Allison\u2019s death wasn\u2019t your fault.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cForget it,\u201d Stiles says, grabbing the book before Peter can stop him. \u201cI don\u2019t need your help anyway. Scott can anchor me. He\u2019ll do it \u2013 you know he will, if it\u2019s for Allison. So you can just, just fucking forget it.\u201d</p>\n<p>He storms out of the loft and down to the Jeep. He has to stop and take several deep breaths in order to calm down. Then he gets out his phone and texts Scott, Lydia, and Kira, saying to meet him at Derek\u2019s loft. That\u2019ll be the safest place to do it, the only place, really. He doesn\u2019t want to risk going to Deaton\u2019s \u2013 it\u2019s far too likely that the veterinarian will have a similar opinion to Peter\u2019s. They can call Jordan once he\u2019s gone over it with the others. He says he\u2019s going to grab some things and he\u2019ll meet them there.</p>\n<p>They beat him there, because of the stops he has to make \u2013 and so does Peter. He gawks slightly at the sight of Peter in the room with the others, talking to them like they don\u2019t hate his guts. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d he demands.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m preventing <em>you</em> from doing something colossally stupid and taking all of us off the cliff with you,\u201d Peter says.</p>\n<p>\u201cHow did you even know \u2013 \u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCome on, Stiles. I\u2019m not an idiot. Obviously you would call them right away, and obviously you would have them come to Derek\u2019s loft. I also knew that you would present this spell like the result that you want is a foregone conclusion, and not mention any of the risks that I just told you about.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles can barely talk, he\u2019s so pissed. \u201cYou son of a \u2013 come on, Scott, you, you know Peter\u2019s a liar! He just doesn\u2019t want us to do this because he doesn\u2019t want us to bring Laura back!\u201d</p>\n<p>Scott looks more worried than anything else. \u201cYeah, I know that Peter lies all the time, but I also know that magic like this is tricky and, and this sort of thing doesn\u2019t come without a price. So I called Deaton \u2013 \u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFuck me,\u201d Stiles says.</p>\n<p>\u201c \u2013 and he backed Peter up and said that the <em>best</em> case scenario is that Allison would come back okay, but Erica and Boyd have been gone so much longer, not even mentioning Laura, that it might drive them nuts to come back \u2013 \u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo, so, okay, we\u2019ll just get Allison, then,\u201d Stiles says. \u201cIf Allison is the only person who can come back, that, that\u2019s still worth the risk, right?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I said to Deaton and he reminded me that that was the best case scenario and that it was way, way more likely that we\u2019d get a demon masquerading as Allison, or bring something else over with her, if you managed to find and bring back anyone at all and didn\u2019t just get stuck between the world of the living and the dead.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles feels tears starting and he hates himself for that. \u201cBut it\u2019s <em>Allison</em>, Scott.\u201d</p>\n<p>Scott has to take a deep breath. \u201cAllison \u2013 Allison being gone is awful. I wake up with it every morning, how awful it is that she\u2019s dead. But we have to accept it and find ways to move on. I hate that as much as you do \u2013 \u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, you don\u2019t!\u201d Stiles shouts. \u201cNobody does! Nobody knows what this is like, knowing that \u2013 <em>feeling</em> what it was like to kill her. The Void wasn\u2019t still inside me when the Oni killed her but I know what it felt, I can feel it every night when I close my eyes, the way it reveled in the cruelty of taking her from us \u2013 \u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cStiles, stop,\u201d Scott says, taking Stiles\u2019 shoulders in both hands. \u201cAllison\u2019s death wasn\u2019t your fault. I won\u2019t let you risk your own life, your own <em>soul</em>, to bring her back. She\u2019s dead and she\u2019s gone and, and it\u2019s horrible and it\u2019ll always hurt, but that doesn\u2019t mean you should sacrifice yourself to try to save her. I can\u2019t lose you too, okay?\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles is crying too hard to speak. He folds into Scott\u2019s embrace. After a few moments, he feels Lydia come up behind him, wrapping her arms around both of them. He sobs so hard that his chest aches and his eyes burn, and at one or two moments, he thinks he might throw up. But gradually, the worst of it passes. He pulls away, his entire body trembling. Scott lets him go, leaning back into where Kira is waiting to comfort him. They\u2019ve both been crying, too, and so has Lydia. He looks around and sees that Peter is gone.</p>\n<p>Derek brings them over a box of tissues and sits down on the floor with them. \u201cThanks for thinking of Laura,\u201d he says quietly.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Stiles blows his nose. \u201cSorry Peter ruined it just because he didn\u2019t want to face her.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek\u2019s eyebrows go up. \u201cIs that what you think he did?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cObviously,\u201d Stiles says, still feeling sore about this.</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so,\u201d Lydia says. \u201cI mean, I only understand about a tenth of what\u2019s going on with him, but he was genuinely freaked when he got here. He practically shook Derek\u2019s teeth out as he demanded to know if you were here and what you\u2019d told us. He was really worried about you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m still going to kick his ass,\u201d Stiles mutters.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy did he know what you were going to ask us to do before we did?\u201d Kira asks. She\u2019s not as familiar with Peter\u2019s history, isn\u2019t as wary of him. \u201cDid you have to ask him about the spell?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI, uh, I run things by him sometimes. He knows a <em>lot</em>, you know, and as someone who actually came back from the dead, I figured he was probably the resident expert on the matter.\u201d Stiles sees both Scott and Lydia look somewhat skeptical of this explanation, despite it being one hundred percent the truth. He sighs. \u201cLook, um. After . . . everything that happened . . . it was hard for me to be around anybody. Especially you guys. I knew that losing Allison had hurt you so much, and I couldn\u2019t . . . I just didn\u2019t want you to see how much I was hurting, didn\u2019t want people worrying about me. One night when I was super fucked up, I went over to Peter\u2019s. I\u2019m still not even sure why I did it. Maybe I thought he would beat the shit out of me like I felt like I deserved. But . . . he didn\u2019t. He was actually . . . really nice to me. I know it sounds weird. But he made me some tea and let me have my hysterics on his sofa until I finally fell asleep, and then he made me breakfast the next morning. So I kept going over. He talked me through some of the worst of it, and when I asked why he was so nice to me, he said it was because he knew how it felt to lose so much that it felt impossible to keep going. I know he did a lot of bad shit, but he\u2019s not actually as bad as he seems. You know, when he\u2019s not fucking up my plans to bring my friends back from the dead.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, that was pretty reasonable of him,\u201d Lydia says, and shrugs. \u201cI\u2019ll never be his number one fan, but if he\u2019s helped you, I\u2019m glad.\u201d</p>\n<p>Scott wrinkles his nose, but keeps his opinions to himself, and Stiles can\u2019t help but be relieved. He sees the pensive look on Derek\u2019s face, and reaches out to prod him in the arm. \u201cYou look like you\u2019re thinking deep thoughts.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek scowls reflexively at him. \u201cI\u2019m just \u2013 he\u2019s my uncle, but I feel like I barely know him anymore.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, yeah, we\u2019ve talked about that,\u201d Stiles says. \u201cHe just says that you\u2019ll never forgive him for killing Laura, he won\u2019t ask you to, so therefore it\u2019s better if he doesn\u2019t try to be your friend. Do with that what you will. I\u2019m not getting involved.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek is still scowling, but it\u2019s a little less harsh. \u201cWhatever,\u201d he mutters.</p>\n<p>\u201cCome on, let\u2019s get you home,\u201d Scott says, helping Stiles off the floor. \u201cDid you bring the Jeep? Great, I\u2019ll drive. I can come get my car later.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFine,\u201d Stiles says with a sigh, leaning against him. But he can\u2019t help but smile a little at Scott\u2019s concern. Once they\u2019re in the car, he closes his eyes, exhausted. The silence doesn\u2019t feel as oppressive as it used to.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>~ ~ ~ ~</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It takes Stiles three days to muster up the courage to go talk to Peter. In the interest of buttering him up a bit, he brings food. Peter likes to eat almost as much as he likes to cook. There\u2019s a Vietnamese place downtown he\u2019s especially fond of, so Stiles picks up take-out and heads over. He knocks before letting himself in, figuring that some politeness wouldn\u2019t go amiss right now.</p>\n<p>Peter is in his usual place on the sofa, with a mug of tea and a book. He glances up as Stiles lets himself in, then looks back down at his book without saying anything. A bare moment later, the scent hits him and his gaze sneaks back up. \u201cIs that from New Dong Khanh?\u201d he asks.</p>\n<p>\u201cYep,\u201d Stiles says, heading into the kitchen with the bag. He hears Peter give a huff behind him, but then follow him. \u201cIt\u2019s a peace offering. Or, well, an apology offering. I fucked up and I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter gives him the side-eye again, but he\u2019s unable to resist the smell of Bo Luc Lac. He grabs one of the take-out containers. \u201cGlad to see you\u2019ve returned to your senses.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t push your luck,\u201d Stiles says, reaching for the dumplings, and Peter gives a snort of laughter. They eat in silence for a minute, before Stiles mentions something that had happened at the restaurant. They chat while they eat, and although there\u2019s an underlying note of tension, it\u2019s not as bad as it could be.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo . . .\u201d Stiles says, when they\u2019re done eating, \u201cI guess we kind of have to talk.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter shrugs. \u201cI don\u2019t see why.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles sighs. \u201cLook, I was a dick, and I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m not mad at you going behind my back because I totally deserved it. So we don\u2019t have to talk about my moment of insanity or bringing back the dead or any of that stuff, but we kind of have to talk about the mates thing.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNot really,\u201d Peter says. \u201cAs I told you, it\u2019s not something that can happen now.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, I remember, but . . .\u201d Stiles struggles to figure out what he\u2019s trying to say. \u201cI need to understand it. Because you say we\u2019re not mates, but at the same time, I feel kind of . . . drawn to you. I need to know what that\u2019s about. I mean. I guess it makes more sense that you\u2019ve been putting up with me all this time. If I\u2019m your mate, you have to.\u201d</p>\n<p>Now Peter is the one who sighs. \u201cIt\u2019s not like that. It\u2019s not some irresistible compulsion.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThen what <em>is</em> it?\u201d Stiles asks.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s just . . . it\u2019s a little hard to explain, actually, but think of it like a sixth sense. When you meet someone, you\u2019ll notice the way they look, the way they sound. An alpha can sense . . . the way they <em>are</em>. And there\u2019s a sense of compatibility. Scent is probably the best metaphor, or taste. Sometimes they go well together, some don\u2019t. Like this.\u201d Peter gestures at his food. \u201cThe basil, the garlic, the peppers \u2013 all of those are compatible flavors.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo like, you\u2019re a walking piece of garlic, and if you meet a piece of pepper you\u2019re like \u2018hey, that smells good\u2019 but if you met a banana you\u2019d be like \u2018ew, gross\u2019?\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter huffs a little but says, \u201cIt\u2019s as good a way of thinking about it as any.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Stiles thinks about all of this. \u201cSo when you met me back then, you thought . . . what, exactly?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat you would be a good match for me. In a variety of ways.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou know, you could have told me at the time that you were offering to werewolf-marry me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter snorts. \u201cYes, that would have made you even more eager to get the Bite, I\u2019m sure. I\u2019m not going to defend my actions that night. At least, not that one.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles chews on his lower lip, pondering. \u201cSo if all it is, is the ability to sense a compatible person, why are you so convinced that I\u2019m not your mate anymore?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not \u2018anymore\u2019. You\u2019re not my mate; you were never my mate. You were, and are, a potential mate. But until you get the Bite from me, all you are is that potential.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThen what does it mean to be a mate? There\u2019s a bond, right?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes. Like the bond between an alpha and his betas, but stronger. It would allow me to find you when needed, to know if you were hurt or in trouble. To draw your idiotic soul back through the Veil if you were dumb enough to cross it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles flips him off. \u201cI <em>said</em> I was sorry. And okay. So unless you become an alpha again, I can\u2019t be your mate, officially. But aren\u2019t we still like . . . something?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSure,\u201d Peter says, rolling his eyes. \u201cWe\u2019re \u2018something\u2019. What an amazing insight.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHey, here\u2019s a thought \u2013 try not being a total asshole about this.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat do you want me to say, Stiles?\u201d Peter asks. \u201cI told you that I didn\u2019t blame you for refusing me. It\u2019s probably a good thing you did, considering everything that\u2019s happened. But you don\u2019t get to blame me for being pissed about losing the chance to have that bond.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t blame you, but that\u2019s just it,\u201d Stiles says. \u201cYou\u2019re talking about this like the fact that we can\u2019t have some official, mystical bond means we\u2019re nothing to each other. That I\u2019m just a guy who hangs out here in the evening while you put up with my presence. Then you roll your eyes at me when I say that, like you don\u2019t understand why on earth I would think that. I like you, okay? I like hanging out with you. I want to know if you like me, too.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGod, that is so <em>junior high</em> \u2013 \u201d Peter says. He\u2019s interrupted when Stiles pushes his chair back and stands up to go. He snags Stiles by the wrist. \u201cI do like you, Stiles. I told you that back then, didn\u2019t I?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t even know me back then,\u201d Stiles says, but he sits back down. \u201cBut okay. I guess you did.\u201d</p>\n<p>They sit quietly for a moment. Then Peter says, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me that you knew?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI dunno,\u201d Stiles says, but realizes that he does. \u201cIt\u2019s just like, I didn\u2019t know what to make of it. I didn\u2019t <em>trust</em> it. I didn\u2019t know if you had been serious or if it was something you might offer again. So I didn\u2019t want to say anything. Then once we were hanging out, I was just . . . afraid of screwing things up. Of losing what we had by trying to have something else. I mean, I was drowning, you get that, right? Having a safe place here was a lifesaver, possibly literally. I was afraid if I brought it up, things would get weird and you wouldn\u2019t want me around anymore. I didn\u2019t want anything to change.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI suppose.\u201d Peter looks dubious.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not like you said anything to me,\u201d Stiles points out. \u201cYou assumed I didn\u2019t know and you were happier with me in the dark, so don\u2019t get up on a high horse about me keeping my secrets.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFair enough,\u201d Peter says.</p>\n<p>Stiles fidgets a little. \u201cSo . . . where do we go from here?\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter takes a drink of his tea, looking at Stiles over the rim of his mug. \u201cYou said you didn\u2019t want things to change, so in my opinion we should put this behind us and never talk about it again.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles gives a snort of laughter. \u201cSounds like a good, healthy coping mechanism.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s me. The paragon of healthy coping mechanisms.\u201d</p>\n<p>After a moment to consider, Stiles says, \u201cOkay, but can we like, kiss sometimes while we don\u2019t talk about it? I don\u2019t want things to change, but maybe we could add some stuff, because to be honest I\u2019ve been obsessing over the fact that you kissed me for months now.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHave you, now?\u201d Peter says, arching an eyebrow in a way that is just ridiculously attractive.</p>\n<p>\u201cMaybe a little.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t say anything about that, either.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cObviously.\u201d Stiles shrugs. \u201cFor the same reason. Not wanting things to change, not wanting to lose what we had by trying to have something else. But since we got through the whole discussion of the mates thing pretty much unscathed, I figured that after that, bringing up kissing was probably safe.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMm hm.\u201d Peter reaches out and snags Stiles\u2019 wrist again. He raises it to his mouth and then pauses, waiting to see if Stiles is going to object or pull away. This time, he doesn\u2019t, and Peter presses his mouth against the inside of Stiles\u2019 wrist, first with a kiss, then with a little nip, not quite hard enough to break the skin. Stiles can practically feel his eyes glazing over as Peter continues to press kisses up his arm.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat is just . . . way sexier than it should be,\u201d he manages, and Peter glances up and smirks at him. \u201cOh, fuck. Okay. I\u2019m gonna come in my pants and it\u2019s gonna be super embarrassing and I don\u2019t even care, will you just <em>kiss me</em> already \u2013 \u201d</p>\n<p>Peter does, and it\u2019s glorious. Stiles doesn\u2019t know a lot about what he\u2019s doing, but he leans into it, letting Peter take the lead. He reaches up to trace his fingers along Peter\u2019s face, and Peter pulls away with a sharp intake of breath. \u201cWhat?\u201d Stiles asks, worried. \u201cDid I do something wrong?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, not . . .\u201d Peter lets out a breath. \u201cThat side of my face is still sensitive, is all.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles nods, realizing that he was caressing the side of Peter\u2019s face where the burn scars were. He reaches up to do it again, rubbing his thumb against his cheekbone, trailing his fingers down along Peter\u2019s jaw. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t hurt, right?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt does not hurt,\u201d Peter confirms, his voice a little tight, strained.</p>\n<p>\u201cThen . . . does it feel good?\u201d Stiles asks, and he can\u2019t help leaning forward, ghosting a kiss over Peter\u2019s cheek.</p>\n<p>\u201cSon of a bitch,\u201d Peter says, his hand curling around the back of Stiles\u2019 neck. \u201cThat\u2019s quite enough of that,\u201d he adds, turning his face to capture Stiles\u2019 mouth with his own again. But he eases off after a few moments, turning the kisses more gentle, softer, before pulling away entirely. \u201cHow about dessert? I have ginger ice cream.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, hell yes,\u201d Stiles says happily. \u201cBest day ever.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>~ ~ ~ ~</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHey! Stiles, wait up!\u201d Scott catches up with Stiles just before he can get in the Jeep and head home after school. \u201cHey, where are you off to? Have you got a minute?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSure, hop in,\u201d Stiles says. \u201cI can give you a lift home.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not going home, Kira and I were going to \u2013 but we can just talk for a few and then you can drop me off back here if you want.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles has a sneaking suspicion that he\u2019s not going to like this conversation, and that Scott wants to have it in the Jeep so Stiles won\u2019t have to look at him or be able to hit him. But he\u2019s been waiting for that for almost a week now, so he sighs and gets in, pulling out of the parking lot.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo what\u2019s up with you and Peter?\u201d Scott asks.</p>\n<p>Stiles gives him a sideways glance and holds back a sigh. \u201cI told you what\u2019s up with me and Peter. We\u2019ve been hanging out.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay, but like.\u201d Scott\u2019s brow furrows. \u201c<em>What\u2019s up</em> with you and Peter?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou know that asking the exact same question with different inflection won\u2019t get you a different answer, right?\u201d Stiles says.</p>\n<p>Now it\u2019s Scott who sighs. \u201cOkay. But I don\u2019t get it. How can you want to be friends with him?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI literally already told you. I was fucked up. He was nice to me, and he made me feel better. You don\u2019t need to make a big deal out of it.\u201d</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a pause while Scott mulls this over, clearly trying to decide whether or not he should push this, and if so, how far. Finally, he says, \u201cLook, I\u2019m worried about you. Not just the whole thing with Allison. But what you said \u2013 about the Mute. Like, knowing that you\u2019ve been hanging out with Peter kind of puts it in a different light. Like he told you that you should be okay with him killing it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles opens his mouth, closes it, and wrestles for a long moment with his temper. \u201cOkay, so, I\u2019m gonna say a thing or two that you won\u2019t like. The fact that you don\u2019t like that Peter killed the Mute has nothing to do with the Mute, or larger morality, or anything other than Peter.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe can\u2019t just \u2013 \u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t have a problem with me and Jackson setting Peter on fire,\u201d Stiles says, \u201cwith every intention of killing him. You didn\u2019t have a problem with Derek finishing the job, beyond the fact that it meant <em>you</em> couldn\u2019t finish the job and see if it really cured your lycanthropy. Oh, and let\u2019s not forget the time you <em>literally</em> poisoned Gerard Argent with mountain ash and then maneuvered him into getting an alpha\u2019s bite, with the <em>full intention</em> that it was going to kill him. And he was human! We could\u2019ve put him in a freakin\u2019 jail cell. So this new golden boy attitude about killing because of your True Alphaness needs to take several seats.\u201d</p>\n<p>Scott\u2019s jaw tightens. \u201cIt\u2019s different.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, exactly. It\u2019s different. It\u2019s different <em>for you</em>. You don\u2019t hold yourself to the same standards as the rest of us and it\u2019s not fucking fair. You don\u2019t want me to carry a gun to protect myself because you don\u2019t trust my judgment when it comes to whether or not I should kill to protect myself or others. You hate the fact that Peter killed the Mute because <em>Peter</em> did it, even though if you\u2019d been attacked by a thing with a wolfsbane-laced hatchet, you probably would have killed it yourself. But it\u2019s different for you, right? Because you\u2019re the True Alpha. Because you didn\u2019t have to kill to get your Alphaness. You\u2019ve conflated these two things in your mind but they\u2019re <em>not</em> related, okay? Killing to survive and killing for power are two <em>entirely</em> separate things.\u201d</p>\n<p>Scott\u2019s quiet for a minute. Finally, he says, \u201cOkay. I mean, at least about the last thing. I don\u2019t know if I would have killed the Mute if it had attacked me. We could have put it in Eichen House, I guess.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, yeah, <em>that</em> would\u2019ve been more kind than killing it.\u201d Stiles resists the urge to roll his eyes into the next hemisphere. \u201cAnyway, my point is just that if you think Peter corrupted me into thinking that it was okay to kill monsters, you\u2019re five hundred percent wrong. Okay? That\u2019s all.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Scott says. \u201cAnd I guess I can see why you might have started going over there when you were messed up, but \u2013 you\u2019ve got us, you know? You don\u2019t have to hang out with Peter.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI like hanging out with Peter. We watch Clone Wars together.\u201d Stiles sees Scott\u2019s frown and says, \u201cI\u2019m not asking you to like him. Hell, I\u2019m not even asking you to like the fact that I\u2019m friends with him. I\u2019m just asking you not to believe that he\u2019s turning me into a horrible person. Okay?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, okay,\u201d Scott says, although he still sounds a little dubious.</p>\n<p>\u201cSuper.\u201d Stiles turns to head back to the school. \u201cLook, I know he did bad things. I even asked him about what he did and he admitted that he was wrong about what he did to you, and stupid on top of it. He regrets a lot of what he did, that he hurt Derek, and especially that he killed Laura. He still can\u2019t even <em>talk</em> about her with me. He wanted revenge for his family so badly that it seemed justified to him. I\u2019m not saying he deserves to win awards for it, just that I don\u2019t think it\u2019s entirely right to judge him for what he did when he was out of his mind. We can agree to disagree on that if it\u2019ll make you feel better.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Scott says again, as Stiles pulls back into the parking lot. \u201cHey, this Friday, we\u2019re going out to see the new Fast and Furious movie. You should come. Okay?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSure,\u201d Stiles says. \u201cSounds good.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>~ ~ ~ ~</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Stiles is relieved to find that their conversation really doesn\u2019t change anything. They still watch movies and talk about random crap. They kiss, yes, and kissing is awesome and amazing and he enjoys the hell out of it. Sometimes Peter leans in and nuzzles his neck, a gesture which is somehow both wolfish and adorable and sexy all at the same time. But other than that, the only real change is that they can go out in public together without Stiles worrying about his friends having a freak-out. They still don\u2019t know the full story, but they know enough that he figures they could handle hearing about him and Peter at the grocery store together.</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t you worry that people are going to recognize you?\u201d Stiles asks curiously, during a quick trip to Whole Foods. \u201cI mean, you\u2019re supposed to be dead.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter shrugs. \u201cPeople are incredibly inobservant, and it\u2019s not like there are \u2018wanted\u2019 posters hanging for me everywhere. Who cares?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI guess,\u201d Stiles says, laughing.</p>\n<p>\u201cBesides, let\u2019s say somebody did recognize me. What are they going to do about it? Report me to the police? I\u2019ll just say I\u2019m somebody else. I have multiple fake identities \u2013 \u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course you do.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c \u2013 and my fingerprints aren\u2019t on file anywhere. Plus, Peter Hale is not technically wanted for any crime, so even if they suspect I\u2019m him, they can\u2019t do anything about it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI get it already; you\u2019re a genius,\u201d Stiles says, rolling his eyes. \u201cOoh, strawberries, is it too early for strawberries? They\u2019re probably from Mexico or something, whatever, let\u2019s buy some strawberries and some chocolate and then let\u2019s eat chocolate-covered strawberries and make out.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou are a ridiculous creature,\u201d Peter replies, but he puts two containers of strawberries into the basket of the cart. \u201cI was going to make chicken cacciatore.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay, but, counterpoint,\u201d Stiles says, \u201cit\u2019s a gorgeous day out. We could buy some stuff at the deli and some chips and strawberries and go have a picnic and make out in the woods.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou just like finding different places for us to make out,\u201d Peter says, rolling his eyes.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, yes, obviously,\u201d Stiles replies.</p>\n<p>Peter doesn\u2019t say anything else about it, but he gets a bunch of stuff at the deli and then the bakery and before long they\u2019ve checked out and he\u2019s heading towards the preserve. Stiles slouches into the passenger seat, enjoying the purr of the car beneath him. Peter\u2019s car is incredibly sexy, and he doesn\u2019t mind telling Peter that at every opportunity. Peter always just smirks as if to say that he knows that.</p>\n<p>Peter parks the car on the side of a dirt road, and carries the two bags from the grocery as well as a blanket he keeps in the trunk of his car for emergencies. They\u2019re walking for about ten minutes before Stiles breaks down and asks where they\u2019re going.</p>\n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s a nice little picnic spot not far from the old house,\u201d Peter says.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh my God,\u201d Stiles says, excited. \u201cAre we going to your teenage make-out spot? And don\u2019t front with me and say you didn\u2019t have one, because I already know you had a kid when you were seventeen so you definitely weren\u2019t keeping it in your pants.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Peter says, amused. \u201cI never took Corinne here, or any of my teenaged flings. This was a family place.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles stops walking, startled although he can\u2019t say why. \u201cYou\u2019re taking me to a family place?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes. Why?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cJust . . .\u201d Stiles lets out a breath. \u201cI\u2019m surprised but I\u2019m not sure why. Like. I know what losing my mom was like, so I know how big a deal it is to bring someone to a special family place.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s a clearing in the woods. Don\u2019t get excited.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll get excited if I want to,\u201d Stiles says, and sticks his tongue out.</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t stick that out if you don\u2019t intend to use it,\u201d Peter says, and Stiles trips over a branch and nearly face-plants into a tree. Peter keeps walking without stopping to help him.</p>\n<p>It is just a clearing in the woods, but it\u2019s a <em>nice</em> clearing in the woods, shaded by some big oak trees and next to a little brook. Peter shakes out the blanket and starts setting out the food. Stiles makes himself a sandwich and sets to it, enjoying the sunlight and the warm breeze. \u201cYou know what\u2019s weird?\u201d he says, and Peter gives him a questioning glance. \u201cI feel okay. I mean. I feel good. Not like, super happy or excited or whatever, but just kind of mellow, that sort of good. I wasn\u2019t sure if I\u2019d ever feel good again.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter gives a little nod. \u201cGlad to hear it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat about you? Do you feel good?\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter\u2019s slight moment of hesitation gives away the answer, but at least he doesn\u2019t lie. Instead, he says, \u201cI feel all right.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBetter than other days?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Peter says. \u201cBetter than a lot of them.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles eats a couple chips and says, \u201cDo you think you\u2019ll ever feel good again? Like, before-the-fire, old-Peter-Hale good?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Peter says.</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Stiles says. \u201cThat\u2019s an okay answer. You know that, right?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSince when are you <em>my</em> therapist?\u201d Peter asks.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey, turnabout is fair play,\u201d Stiles says, smirking, and Peter just rolls his eyes. But when he changes the subject, Stiles allows it. They talk off and on while they eat, occasionally lapsing into a few minutes of companionable silence. Stiles eats way too many of the strawberries, and Peter eats too much of the chocolate.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo did you guys have picnics here, back in the day?\u201d Stiles asks, as he\u2019s sprawled out on the blanket.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, on occasion. Normally we\u2019d just eat in the backyard, but this place was nice enough that we would trek down here for special occasions.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIs this a special occasion?\u201d Stiles asks, excited.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Peter says, \u201cbut we can\u2019t exactly eat in my backyard anymore, can we.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, yeah. Guess not. What if \u2013 \u201d</p>\n<p>Peter lifts a hand, his head suddenly up, scenting the air. Stiles immediately snaps his mouth shut, because he\u2019s seen that behavior on all the wolves, and it never bodes well. He waits while Peter scans the horizon. \u201cWe should go,\u201d Peter says. \u201cLeave the food. There\u2019s not much left anyway. I\u2019ll come back for the blanket later.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Stiles scrambles to his feet. Peter takes off at a brisk walk, and Stiles practically has to jog to keep up with him.</p>\n<p>Bare seconds later, he hears a high-pitched whine and then a <em>thwap</em> and then he\u2019s staring down the head of a crossbow bolt an inch from his face and he nearly pisses his pants. \u201cJesus fucking Christ!\u201d he blurts out, as Peter tosses the bolt away.</p>\n<p>\u201cRun,\u201d Peter says, and Stiles does. They\u2019ve been running about twenty seconds, which felt like a short eternity, before Peter tackles him and throws him out of the path of another bolt. It tears a sizable gash in Stiles\u2019 thigh as it goes past, but doesn\u2019t impact directly. Stiles has barely climbed to his feet when Peter snatches another bolt out of the air, and then they\u2019re running again.</p>\n<p>Peter is a few paces ahead of him this time, so Stiles has a clear view of it when he suddenly stumbles and falls. Stiles tries to stop, overbalances, and lands on his ass in the dirt and leaves. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d he asks, panting for breath and searching the trees for the assassin.</p>\n<p>\u201cMy fucking hand,\u201d Peter grits out, holding it out where Stiles can see. Stiles looks at the angry red weal across his palm and swears. Dark red lines are already branching out of it. \u201cCoated the bolts in something, then barbed the stems. Was hoping it wouldn\u2019t kick in so fast. One I could have handled, but two \u2013 \u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat do we do?\u201d Stiles asks, but he\u2019s already on his feet and dragging Peter\u2019s arm up over his shoulders. He wobbles and nearly falls; his own wound isn\u2019t exactly minor.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re almost to the old house.\u201d Peter helps balance him and the two of them manage to stagger along. No more bolts come their way. Stiles realizes, with a sinking feeling, that the assassin probably believes the wounds he\u2019s given are fatal. All he has to do now is wait \u2013 why waste more bolts?</p>\n<p>They manage to get inside the house, and collapse in the front hallway. Stiles looks down at the blood soaking through his pants and swears. He\u2019s bleeding heavily. He manages to get his pants off and then strips his shirt off as well, folding it and applying pressure. Fortunately, the wound is on the outside of his thigh, so it\u2019s easy enough to sit down and put his weight on the makeshift compress.</p>\n<p>Peter has slumped against a wall. He\u2019s pale and breathing heavily, sweat beading on his forehead. \u201cRed wolfsbane,\u201d he says, panting. \u201cNot good. Even a low dose is fatal.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat do we do?\u201d Stiles asks.</p>\n<p>\u201cAlways felt like I\u2019d end up dying here,\u201d Peter says, eyes tracking aimlessly over the ceiling. \u201cThis is going to be the third time I\u2019ve done it, counting the fire \u2013 which I do. What are the odds of that?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPeter!\u201d Stiles gives him a light slap upside the face. \u201cFocus. Is there any treatment?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s an antidote, but it\u2019s not like I carry it on me. Deaton would have it.\u201d Peter\u2019s eyes sag shut. \u201cNever liked him. Such a sanctimonious ass.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles ignores his rambling and grabs his phone. He\u2019s halfway through composing a text to Scott when he realizes he has no signal. \u201cWhat the fuck! I\u2019ve had signal here before, I know I have \u2013 \u201d He swears profusely. Whoever has them cornered must have a signal blocker. He forces himself to take a deep breath. Those things only have a short range. He doesn\u2019t know which side of the house their attacker is on, but if he goes up to the second floor and moves around, he might be able to get a signal. \u201cPeter, I have to go try to get a signal so I can call the cavalry. Don\u2019t go anywhere, okay?\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter just nods. Stiles stands up, and the world grays out in front of him. He finds himself on the floor again, blinking up at the ceiling. \u201cFuck, how much blood have I lost?\u201d he mumbles, mostly to himself, since Peter certainly doesn\u2019t seem to be listening. He grits his teeth and sits up, then uses the wall to support his weight as he eases back to his feet. Nausea twists at his gut, but he doesn\u2019t faint again. After a moment, he hobbles towards the remains of the staircase.</p>\n<p>It takes far more effort than he had anticipated, and he has to stop twice, gamely hanging onto the railing and trying not to vomit. But he manages it through sheer stubbornness, and heads into the first room. No signal. The second room. No signal. Third, fourth, fifth . . .</p>\n<p>One bar.</p>\n<p>He takes a deep breath and opens a group text to his father, Scott, and Derek. He doesn\u2019t know if it\u2019ll take more time for a longer message to go through, so he\u2019s brief. \u2018Trapped at Hale house by assassin. Poisoned bolts. Be careful but hurry.\u2019 He hits send.</p>\n<p>His phone processes the message for a brief eternity before popping up \u2018message could not be sent\u2019. He swears and tries again, with the same result.</p>\n<p>He looks around and places himself in the building. He\u2019s in the back, in a corner. That makes sense \u2013 the assassin had followed them to the front and presumably set up camp there. He knows he\u2019s got them cornered, knows that the wounds he\u2019s dealt Peter at least are fatal \u2013 why bother coming in and risking himself, when he can simply wait outside until they\u2019re dead?</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a window on the back wall. Stiles shuffles over to it and holds his phone outside, hitting send with his thumb.</p>\n<p>It still doesn\u2019t work.</p>\n<p>\u201cGod <em>damn</em> it,\u201d he spits out, nearly crying from frustration. \u201cCome the fuck on!\u201d</p>\n<p>He climbs onto the windowsill, leaning the top half of his body out the window, wishing Peter was there to hold his legs. Stretches his arm out as far as he can. Hits send.</p>\n<p>It takes so long that he thinks it\u2019s going to time out again, but then the little time stamp appears. Sent. The relief is so strong that he nearly drops the phone. He hauls himself back inside and nearly throws up. He takes a moment to just sit and apply pressure to the wound again.</p>\n<p>Either several minutes or hours later, he realizes that he had passed out. He shakes himself and decides not to risk getting up. He shuffles down the hallway on his hands and knees. Of course, his wounded thigh does not like doing that at all, but the stabbing pain at least keeps him conscious. He half lowers himself, half falls down the stairs.</p>\n<p>Peter hasn\u2019t moved. His eyes are a little glassy, and the dark red veins have spread all the way up past his elbow. \u201cSon of a bitch,\u201d Stiles mutters, wishing there was something he could do. Peter blinks at him slowly. \u201cCome on, Peter, stay with me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThought you had gone,\u201d Peter coughs out.</p>\n<p>\u201cDumbass,\u201d Stiles says. \u201cI\u2019m not leaving you alone.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou should,\u201d Peter mumbles.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou just fucking saved my life like, three times in the last hour,\u201d Stiles says. \u201cDon\u2019t be stupid.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter shakes his head. \u201cCouldn\u2019t save them,\u201d he says. \u201cShould\u2019ve seen it. Talia . . . she depended on me. But I didn\u2019t see it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPeter, it\u2019s not your fault,\u201d Stiles says. \u201cLook, you\u2019re the smartest guy I know, okay? If you didn\u2019t see it, nobody could have. No matter what happened, I know that you did the best I could, that you never would have just let it happen.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter\u2019s eyes close. For a moment, Stiles thinks he\u2019s passed out, but then they open again, looking glassy, disoriented. \u201cNever would\u2019ve thought she could . . .\u201d His voice trails off. Stiles decides that unconsciousness might be his friend at this point, so he just holds Peter\u2019s uninjured hand in one of his own, using the other to press his shirt against his wound. \u201cHow could she?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cKate was psycho,\u201d Stiles says, not really paying attention to Peter\u2019s feverish ramblings.</p>\n<p>\u201cNot Kate,\u201d Peter says. \u201cLaura.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles frowns. \u201cLaura?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI didn\u2019t see it,\u201d Peter says. \u201cThings she said . . . she wanted to be alpha. She wanted . . . Talia was hard on her. On everybody. But she . . .\u201d His hand curls around Stiles\u2019 squeezing hard. \u201cHow could she?\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles feels the breath has been kicked out of him. \u201cWait, wait. Peter. Are you saying that <em>Laura</em> helped Kate kill your family? Is that . . . is that why you killed her?\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter rolls onto his side and gives a faint groan. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Talia. I\u2019m so sorry. I should\u2019ve seen it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cJesus Christ,\u201d Stiles says, because he feels like he has to say <em>something</em>, but hell if he knows what the appropriate response to this is. \u201cPeter, come on. Stay with me here. Tell me \u2013 tell me about Laura.\u201d He hopes that will keep Peter awake, which always seems important in the movies.</p>\n<p>\u201cI knew she hated Talia,\u201d Peter mumbles. \u201cNever really blamed her. Talia \u2013 expected so much. And she was \u2013 controlling.\u201d He pants for breath. \u201cIf she had killed Talia \u2013 I would have forgiven her. Accepted her as my alpha. But she didn\u2019t want anybody to suspect her. So she killed \u2013 everyone.\u201d A shudder rocks his body. \u201cI should have protected them. After \u2013 the fire \u2013 being alone like that \u2013 it hurt so much. We aren\u2019t made to be alone. I was alone for so long.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI know,\u201d Stiles says, squeezing his hand.</p>\n<p>\u201cThen you came . . .\u201d Peter\u2019s thumb traces over Stiles\u2019 knuckles, and then his eyes close.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey, hey, stay with me,\u201d Stiles repeats. He leans down and presses his mouth against Peter\u2019s. His lips are colder than usual, and he doesn\u2019t respond. \u201cCome on, Peter, stay with me. You\u2019re not alone anymore, and I \u2013 I don\u2019t want to be alone either, so don\u2019t \u2013 don\u2019t you dare leave me, you son of a bitch \u2013 \u201d</p>\n<p>Peter coughs, and his body convulses. He draws in a shuddering breath and then goes limp again. Stiles swears viciously and checks for a pulse. It\u2019s there, weak and erratic against his fingertips. \u201cCome on, come on,\u201d Stiles mutters, shaking Peter hard. He still doesn\u2019t wake, although he coughs again. Stiles looks down at his arm, at those dark red lines snaking up past his elbow and almost all the way to his shoulder. \u201cCome on, Peter, don\u2019t do this, you are the toughest son of a bitch I have ever met, you can\u2019t die here \u2013 \u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles practically jumps out of his skin when the front door to the house bangs open and Scott charges inside with Derek on his heels. \u201cThe assassin \u2013 \u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYour dad\u2019s got him; he\u2019s passing him off to one of the deputies,\u201d Scott says. \u201cFuck, you\u2019re bleeding, that looks bad \u2013 \u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about me, it\u2019s not too bad, but Peter \u2013 he\u2019s poisoned, he said it was red wolfsbane and that Deaton should have the antidote, but he passed out a minute ago and I can\u2019t get him to wake up.\u201d</p>\n<p>Scott gets an arm underneath Stiles\u2019 shoulders and helps him to his feet. Derek scoops Peter up, slinging him over his back in a fireman\u2019s carry. Stiles tries to follow them, but Scott is pulling him in the other direction, and he nearly falls. \u201cNo, wait, where are you taking me?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTo the ambulance, dumbass,\u201d Scott says, although his voice is patient. \u201cThat\u2019s not just a scratch; you\u2019re going to need stitches.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, I \u2013 I have to stay with Peter \u2013 \u201d Stiles says, trying to break free. His father jogs up, face creased in a frown. \u201cHe\u2019s been alone for so long and if he thinks he\u2019s alone again it might, might \u2013 I don\u2019t want him to think he\u2019s alone again \u2013 \u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe won\u2019t be alone,\u201d Derek says abruptly. \u201cI\u2019ll take care of him.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles wants to argue, but he knows they don\u2019t have <em>time</em>, that Derek needs to get Peter to Deaton <em>now</em>, and that he wouldn\u2019t be able to keep up anyway. He can keep fighting with Scott at the hospital. \u201cOkay, but \u2013 but you have to stay with him, okay? You have to stay with him and do the pain drain and, and try to remember that he\u2019s your uncle and you love him, or at least you used to. Promise me, okay?\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek\u2019s looking at Stiles like he\u2019s grown another head, but after a bare second he nods and says, \u201cYeah, I promise,\u201d before he takes off at a run.</p>\n<p>\u201cCome on, Stiles,\u201d Scott says, and tugs him over to the ambulance. Stiles goes with him, and grumbles as they get him up into the ambulance. Now that he\u2019s not so focused on Peter, he realizes that his leg hurts like a bitch. It takes what feels like a small eternity to get to the hospital, whereupon he only has a brief wait before he\u2019s examined and it\u2019s agreed upon that he\u2019s going to need stitches.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhatever gets me out of here fastest,\u201d Stiles says, itching with the need to check on Peter.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going anywhere in a hurry,\u201d the doctor says, examining the wound. \u201cYou\u2019ve lost a lot of blood. Not enough to need a transfusion, but definitely plenty of saline and rest. We\u2019ll keep you overnight to be on the safe side.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut \u2013 \u201d Stiles says.</p>\n<p>\u201cLet\u2019s get some painkillers into you,\u201d the doctor says, and Melissa comes over with what she needs for an IV.</p>\n<p>\u201cLook, I really can\u2019t stay overnight,\u201d Stiles says, as she approaches. His father is looking at him with a pinched expression on his face. He swings his legs over the side of the bed and stands up. \u201cI\u2019m fine, I just \u2013 ooh, I\u2019m on the floor. When did <em>that</em> happen?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cStiles,\u201d Noah intervenes here, as he and Scott get Stiles back onto the stretcher. \u201cPipe down and do as you\u2019re told.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, sir,\u201d Stiles says meekly. He lets Melissa get the IV started, and then there are painkillers, which, okay, he\u2019s glad he stuck around for that. He stares up at the ceiling and frets in silence while the nurse cleans out the wound and then the doctor stitches it up. They tell him they\u2019re going to come get him when they have a room ready and then leave him in the little ER alcove with his father.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhere\u2019s my phone?\u201d Stiles asks. \u201cIt was in my pants. Where are my pants?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYour pants are in the trash, and your phone is here.\u201d Noah seems to debate not giving it to him, but then decides that would just be cruel and unusual. He hands it over.</p>\n<p>Stiles immediately calls Derek, who picks up on the second ring. \u201cHey, how is he? Did you get him to Deaton\u2019s? You are still with him, right? You promised. Is he \u2013 \u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cStiles,\u201d Derek says, with a hint of exasperation. \u201cYes, I\u2019m still with him. Deaton is drawing the poison out, and it\u2019s a bit of a process, so I can\u2019t really talk right now.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut he\u2019s going to be okay?\u201d Stiles asks.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019ll live,\u201d Derek says. \u201cDeaton wasn\u2019t sure if he\u2019d keep his hand, though. The wolfsbane did a lot of damage to it and Deaton had to draw it all back to the lower arm to make sure it didn\u2019t reach his heart.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles winces, thinking of how he\u2019s watched Peter deftly chop vegetables and grind herbs and, well, do a lot of things that require two hands. He reminds himself firmly that lots of people are disabled and get by fine. \u201cOkay. Can I talk to him?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo. He\u2019s not conscious.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay, well, call me when he is,\u201d Stiles says, and hangs up. He sees his father regarding him pensively. He looks down for a moment, but then decides he\u2019s not going to let himself be embarrassed. He meets his father\u2019s gaze and says, \u201cHe saved my life today, Dad. He caught that second crossbow bolt even after he knew they were poisoned. He could have let me die to save himself, and he didn\u2019t.\u201d</p>\n<p>After a moment, Noah nods. He reaches over and tousles Stiles\u2019 hair, saying, \u201cWell, then, I\u2019m glad he was there. Now you get some rest, okay?\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles sighs and nods in return. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>~ ~ ~ ~</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Surprisingly, Stiles does fall asleep. The blood loss and the exertion have taken their toll on him. When he wakes up, it\u2019s because his cell phone is ringing. He fumbles around for it in something of a daze, then hears his father\u2019s voice. \u201cHey. Yeah, he\u2019s sleeping, I don\u2019t want to \u2013 \u201d</p>\n<p>That\u2019s as far as Noah gets before Stiles wakes up enough to tug the phone out of his hands. \u201c\u2019Lo?\u201d he mumbles.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou wanted me to call you when Peter was awake,\u201d Derek says abruptly.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, I \u2013 \u201d</p>\n<p>Derek has clearly handed off the phone already, because a few moments later, Peter\u2019s hoarse voice says, \u201cHello, Stiles.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, thank God,\u201d Stiles says. \u201cAre you okay? How do you feel? Did Derek do the pain drain? He promised he would.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m all right,\u201d Peter interrupts. \u201cMy hand feels like it was dipped in lava, but it seems to still be attached. Give me a day or two and I\u2019ll be back to normal. What about you? Derek said you were \u2013 how did he phrase this? \u2013 acting more weird than normal.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, I thought you might die,\u201d Stiles retorts. \u201cAnd I just \u2013 didn\u2019t want you to wake up alone. You were, uh, kind of out-of-it and I thought if you woke up and thought you were back in the hospital and your pack had abandoned you again \u2013 I don\u2019t know, okay? I lost a lot of blood and I was worried about you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNoted,\u201d Peter says, then a little bit more softly, \u201cand appreciated. Now get some rest and I\u2019ll see you in a few days.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Stiles says goodbye and hangs up, and sees his father giving him that look again. He fakes a huge yawn and closes his eyes without saying anything in response to the look. After a few moments, he feels his father tucking the blankets around his shoulders.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s discharged the next day, although his father makes him promise to take it easy. They\u2019ve got the assassin in custody, but both his father and Scott seem inclined to hover. He doubts he\u2019ll get a chance to go see Peter in the near future, so he texts him frequently, mostly about everyday stuff but occasionally just to check in.</p>\n<p>\u201cHow do we still not know the deal with these guys?\u201d he asks his father over dinner the next day.</p>\n<p>Noah grimaces. \u201cWell, part of the problem is that we\u2019re pretty good at our jobs. We can\u2019t try to trace payments if none are being made, and since we became aware of the list, none of the bounty hunters have been successful.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWow, hey, we\u2019re awesome,\u201d Stiles says. \u201cWhat about the list itself? Where did it come from?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cE-mail,\u201d Noah says, shaking his head. \u201cFrom a throwaway address that anybody could have used. All we know is that it was sent from Beacon Hills. The IP address that was used to send it was the free Wi-Fi at a coffee shop.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUgh,\u201d Stiles says. \u201cThis blows.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not fond of it either, trust me,\u201d Noah says dryly. \u201cOn the upside, you and Peter\u2019s misadventure yesterday has given us an opportunity. We\u2019ve kept it quiet that we apprehended the guy, and there hasn\u2019t been anything in the news. So since Peter was badly wounded, we can use the assassin\u2019s phone to say that he was killed and request a payment. If whoever\u2019s behind this pays, that might be something we can trace. And if he doesn\u2019t, we\u2019ll have to figure out how he knows that the claim isn\u2019t legit, and there are only a handful of ways he\u2019d be able to know that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNice,\u201d Stiles says, nodding approval of this plan. \u201cOkay. Keep me in the loop?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWill do.\u201d</p>\n<p>The next day, Scott has retrieved the Jeep from Peter\u2019s loft, where he had parked it before everything had happened. \u201cSo, uh . . . why were you over at Peter\u2019s?\u201d he asks, handing Stiles the keys.</p>\n<p>\u201cTo get his banana bread recipe,\u201d Stiles deadpans. Scott gives him the side-eye but seems to decide he doesn\u2019t want to push the issue. He says he\u2019ll see Stiles at school the next day and departs. Finally, Stiles is able to head over to Peter\u2019s, and finds, to his annoyance, that he\u2019s not there. He texts Peter, \u2018where are you?\u2019</p>\n<p>A few minutes later, Peter texts back, \u2018Getting a check up.\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018Okay,\u2019 Stiles replies, flopping onto the sofa. T\u2019Challa immediately jumps up onto his lap and settles in. \u2018I\u2019m at your place, stealing the love of your cat.\u2019</p>\n<p>Peter doesn\u2019t dignify that with a reply. He gets back to the apartment about half an hour later, carrying a paper bag in one hand. The other is wrapped in bandages and is somewhat pungent. \u201cGeez, what did Deaton do to you?\u201d Stiles asks.</p>\n<p>\u201cCured me, or so I\u2019m told,\u201d Peter says, setting the bag down. \u201cThe poultice is helping the skin heal. They drew the poison out through the veins in my hands, an experience only marginally less painful than being burned alive.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDerek did do the pain drain, right?\u201d Stiles asks suspiciously.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, but there\u2019s only so much it can do,\u201d Peter says. He sees Stiles\u2019 face and adds, \u201cI\u2019m fine, Stiles. I certainly hope I\u2019ll never repeat the experience, but I think I\u2019ll recover with no major scarring, physical or otherwise.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou just . . .\u201d Stiles shifts from foot to foot. \u201cYou got hurt like that to protect me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter arches an eyebrow at him. \u201cYes. A position I voluntarily put myself in. It\u2019s not like I didn\u2019t know you had that bounty on your head. What\u2019s your point?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMy point is that \u2013 I don\u2019t like it,\u201d Stiles declares, and leans in for a kiss.</p>\n<p>Peter huffs out a laugh against Stiles\u2019 mouth, then returns the kiss a little more generously, reaching up with his uninjured hand to run his fingers through Stiles\u2019 hair. \u201cI\u2019ll make a note of that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGood.\u201d Stiles pulls away. \u201cUh, but, we should probably talk about the whole thing with Laura.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLaura?\u201d Peter looks slightly blank, although Stiles isn\u2019t sure whether or not he\u2019s faking it. \u201cWhat about her?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLook, uh.\u201d Stiles rubs a hand over the back of his head. \u201cHow much of what happened in the house do you remember? Because you kind of said some stuff about Laura, and if you don\u2019t remember saying it, I might have to back up a little.\u201d</p>\n<p>Now Peter looks wary. \u201cI don\u2019t remember a lot after the poison took hold, and I definitely don\u2019t remember saying anything about Laura. And if you\u2019re waiting for me to give away things I don\u2019t want you to know by having me \u2018guess\u2019 what I might have told you, that\u2019s going to be a long wait.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, I really don\u2019t need to do that,\u201d Stiles says. \u201cYou pretty much told me everything. About how you killed Laura because she killed your family.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter\u2019s face closes off. \u201cI don\u2019t know what I said, but \u2013 \u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t try to convince me you didn\u2019t mean it or that you were delirious and imagining shit,\u201d Stiles says. \u201cCome on. Don\u2019t fucking insult me. It makes sense now that I\u2019m thinking about it, because I\u2019ve never understood why you killed Laura. Or why you were so vehemently against any chance I might be able to resurrect her.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter!\u201d Peter shouts, startling Stiles. Then he looks away and says flatly, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay, but it really, really does,\u201d Stiles says. He lets that sit for a moment before saying, \u201cHow did you know?\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter sighs. Seeing that Stiles isn\u2019t going to drop it, he says, \u201cProcess of elimination. I knew that whoever had set the fire had an inside source. The Hale house had a tunnel that led into the woods. Only the pack knew about it. But the night of the fire, it had been blocked off. That meant that somebody inside the pack had helped the killer. There were only three survivors. I knew it wasn\u2019t me, obviously, and it couldn\u2019t have been Derek. That left Laura.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou do know that <em>Derek</em> thinks it was Derek, right?\u201d Stiles says. \u201cI mean, he was dating Kate. He thinks he gave something away somehow. I don\u2019t know how much detail he has about what happened that night.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter shrugs. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t Derek, though. Because once I realized it could be Laura . . . a lot of things fell into place. She never got along with Talia. I\u2019ve told you what Talia was like, how she was domineering. Laura chafed under her control. We <em>all</em> knew that. They fought more as Laura grew up. Laura would talk about how she couldn\u2019t wait until she was alpha.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cEven so . . .\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI knew it was Laura,\u201d Peter continues, \u201cbecause Laura left me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles winces. \u201cI can see why you\u2019d be upset about that, but what does it prove?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHunters had just killed our family. But she left me behind, in a long-term care ward, under my <em>own name</em>. She didn\u2019t care if I lived or died \u2013 probably would have preferred the latter. And that was <em>her</em> decision. Not Derek\u2019s. The only reason Laura would have done that would have been if she wanted me dead \u2013 or at the very least, wanted to make sure I wasn\u2019t around her long enough to think about her involvement.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles thinks it all over, thinks about what he knows about Talia, about Laura, about Peter. Then he nods. \u201cI\u2019m surprised she didn\u2019t just have you killed, if we\u2019re going to be honest.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShe obviously originally intended that, but I think she left me alive for the same reason she let Derek live. Again, the process of elimination.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMeaning?\u201d Stiles asks, frowning.</p>\n<p>\u201cIf there were only two people alive, the innocent would know that she was guilty. But if there were <em>three</em> survivors . . .\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles nods slowly. \u201cYou could think it had been Derek, or at least you might not be sure it was her. And Derek might think it was you.\u201d His frown deepens. \u201cDidn\u2019t she know about Derek and Kate?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course she did. She and Kate planned it all together. But the idea was to muddy the waters as much as possible.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHow much of this do you have confirmation of?\u201d Stiles asks. \u201cDid you talk to her when she came back?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, Lord no. I wasn\u2019t about to give her a chance to escape.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThen how do you know?\u201d Stiles asks. \u201cI mean, how do you <em>know</em>? It could \u2013 could still be that Derek told Kate \u2013 \u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNobody could have <em>accidentally</em> told someone about that tunnel,\u201d Peter says. \u201cAnd that means it wasn\u2019t Derek. If it wasn\u2019t Derek, and it wasn\u2019t me, then it had to be Laura, and it had to have been on purpose.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles thinks about it for a long minute. Then he lets out a breath and nods. \u201cOkay. Yeah, okay. But why haven\u2019t you ever told anybody? Derek, I mean. It\u2019s not like you\u2019re going to start a conversation with a stranger about it, and I know you don\u2019t give a shit what the cops think, and everyone else is dead, but \u2013 Derek.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter gives him a look. \u201cIt took ten minutes to convince <em>you</em> that I was right, and you came into this conversation predisposed to believe me. Derek would never believe Laura was capable of such a thing. It\u2019ll just look like I\u2019m trying to avoid responsibility for killing Laura, manipulate him into forgiving me for murdering his sister.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay, but he deserves to know,\u201d Stiles says. \u201cHe still thinks it\u2019s his fault. Can you even imagine what living with that has been like for him?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI would lift that burden from his shoulders if I could,\u201d Peter says, \u201cbut I can\u2019t. Because he won\u2019t believe me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou could lay it all out for him, the way you did for me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe wouldn\u2019t let me get past the first sentence, and you know it,\u201d Peter says. \u201cAnd more than that, if I tell him about the tunnel, he might start thinking that I was the one responsible, because he\u2019ll know he didn\u2019t tell Kate about that.\u201d He shakes his head. \u201cNo, Stiles. It\u2019s a miracle that Derek even lets me live in the same town as him. If I try to bring this up, he\u2019ll never speak to me again. I have worked my ass off to stay in a position where I can protect him. I\u2019m not going to risk it for this.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles sighs. He can see where Peter\u2019s coming from, and he knows how deeply Peter loves his remaining niece and nephew. In Peter\u2019s shoes, he wouldn\u2019t want to take that risk either. \u201cOkay. Derek wouldn\u2019t believe you because, well, you\u2019re kind of a liar by trade. What if I \u2013 \u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMake them think that I\u2019ve manipulated you into believing me? Yes, what an excellent idea.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles flips him off. \u201cWhat if I <em>find evidence</em>,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s got to be something we can find, some concrete proof we could give Derek so he\u2019d have to believe it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLike what? I very much doubt Kate and Laura were texting each other about their murder plans, and even if they were, they\u2019re both dead now. I can\u2019t exactly go investigate them.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cKate\u2019s technically still an unsolved murder, so her phone and stuff are in evidence,\u201d Stiles says, \u201cwhich, okay, would maybe be a dead end. But she might have said something, told somebody something \u2013 there might be a way. It\u2019s at least worth <em>trying</em>, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter shrugs.</p>\n<p>\u201cLook, it\u2019s obvious that you still blame yourself for not figuring out what was happening,\u201d Stiles says, and Peter snarls at him. \u201cYou keep trying to find a way you could have prevented it, just like I kept trying \u2013 still keep trying, to be honest \u2013 to find a way to prevent Allison\u2019s death. But if that wasn\u2019t my fault, then this wasn\u2019t yours. I know that you did everything you could. But if you won\u2019t do it for yourself, then do it for Derek, because I know that he still hates himself for what happened. He blames himself just as much if not more than you blame yourself, and you know how much that sucks. So if you really love your nephew, you\u2019ll find some way to tell him the truth.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure knowing that Laura did it will be that much better,\u201d Peter says.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt will be.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI suppose.\u201d Peter sighs. \u201cAll right, fine. If you want to look into it, go ahead. Just don\u2019t say anything to Derek until you\u2019ve talked to me about whatever it is you find.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay. And if I can\u2019t find anything, well . . .\u201d Stiles steps closer and wraps his arms around Peter, hugging him tightly. \u201cAt least I know. So you don\u2019t have to carry it alone anymore.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHow sentimental of you,\u201d Peter says, but one of his hands is gripping the back of Stiles\u2019 shirt, and he presses his face into the crook of Stiles\u2019 neck. After a long moment, he says, \u201cI loved her, you know. Laura.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI know,\u201d Stiles says, and he holds Peter for a long time.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>~ ~ ~ ~</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay, so, I need your help with something,\u201d Stiles says, thinking that if he talks very fast, he might be able to glide past the details of the situation without his father asking too many questions. \u201cLet\u2019s just say that, hypothetically, I think someone involved in the Hale house fire might have escaped notice, and that, hypothetically, I wanted to look at Kate\u2019s phone to see if she\u2019d had contact with anyone that Peter missed. In that hypothetical situation, could you get Kate\u2019s phone out of evidence for me?\u201d</p>\n<p>Noah pinches the bridge of his nose, looking like he feels a migraine coming on. \u201cHypothetically, you should be in school.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShit, is it a school day? Uh, well, we can talk about that later,\u201d Stiles says, and his father looks even more pained. \u201cCome on, Dad. Help me out. I know you love a mystery. And you\u2019re the best detective I know! So if anyone can help me \u2013 \u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cStop,\u201d Noah says, and points to the chair. \u201cSit down. Cut the flattery.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, sir.\u201d Stiles plants himself in the chair and looks at his father hopefully.</p>\n<p>\u201cNow tell me why you\u2019re suddenly going on about the Hale house fire.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles hopes that some half-truths will suffice, since he certainly isn\u2019t going to tell his father whole ones. \u201cWhile we were trapped in the house and waiting to be rescued, and Peter was kind of delusional, he said something about the fire. About how the tunnel out of their basement had been blocked off. But how could Kate have known to do that? All this time, we\u2019ve assumed Derek accidentally let something slip to her \u2013 but he couldn\u2019t have accidentally told her about the tunnel, and he wouldn\u2019t have <em>purposefully</em> told her about the tunnel. Which means that Kate might have been talking to somebody else.\u201d</p>\n<p>Noah listens to this with a faint frown, and to Stiles\u2019 relief, he doesn\u2019t immediately argue. Instead, he says, \u201cI guess that\u2019s possible. But to be honest, I don\u2019t see that it matters now. If she was talking to somebody else, it would have been somebody else in the Hale family, and they\u2019re all dead now.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, I know,\u201d Stiles says, \u201cbut for Derek\u2019s sake, I think it might help him to know that he didn\u2019t betray his family, accidentally or otherwise.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFair point.\u201d Noah chews on this for a minute. \u201cBut why do I feel like there\u2019s more to this than you\u2019re telling me?\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles looks innocently at the ceiling. \u201cWell, geez, Dad, I don\u2019t know. I guess you have a suspicious type of personality \u2013 \u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd I\u2019m the best detective you know?\u201d Noah says, and Stiles rubs a hand over the back of his head, chagrined. Noah is still frowning at him thoughtfully. \u201cYou think it was Laura, don\u2019t you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhaaaaaat?\u201d Stiles says, trying to maintain his composure. \u201cThat, uh, that\u2019s a bit of a leap, right? How\u2019d you come to <em>that</em> conclusion \u2013 \u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBecause Laura was the only survivor besides Peter and Derek,\u201d Noah says, giving his son an unimpressed look. \u201cWhich means that if someone betrayed the family, it\u2019s most likely that it was her. And since Peter saved your life the other day, even risking his own to do it, you might have started thinking about what kind of a person he really is. And you should probably know, although I\u2019m pretty sure it\u2019s going to piss you off, that Scott was in here a couple weeks ago expressing his concern about the fact that you and Peter seem to have struck up some sort of friendship.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh my Goddddddddd,\u201d Stiles says, immediately forgetting about Laura entirely. \u201cI\u2019m going to kill him. I <em>told</em> him that I was fine, that it wasn\u2019t a big deal, and I knew he didn\u2019t like it but did he <em>seriously</em> go behind my back to <em>tattle</em> on me like we\u2019re still in elementary school \u2013 \u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cScott is worried about you,\u201d Noah says, \u201cwhich isn\u2019t a bad thing. And don\u2019t get me wrong, in your shoes I\u2019d be pretty annoyed at him too. But he has valid reasons to dislike Peter, so \u2013 \u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, I know,\u201d Stiles says. \u201cWe had a whole God damned discussion about it. If he didn\u2019t like what I had to say, he can address that with <em>me</em>, not go behind my back and \u2013 \u201d He stops and forces himself to take a deep breath. \u201cWhat\u2019d you say to him?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNothing he wanted to hear,\u201d Noah says, and Stiles feels at least a little of the tension go out of his shoulders. \u201cI told him that you were old enough to make your own decisions about who was and was not your friend, that you knew all about what Peter had done so you weren\u2019t making those decisions in ignorance, and that since your friendship with Peter obviously wasn\u2019t hurting you, I thought we should let it ride.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThanks,\u201d Stiles says.</p>\n<p>Noah waves this aside. \u201cYou think Peter killed Laura because she betrayed the family?\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles nods and says, \u201cHe did a lot of bad things. I won\u2019t deny that. Hell, <em>he</em> doesn\u2019t deny it, and when I told him that I thought of it like he was a separate person back then, he himself told me not to give him the easy out like that. That he was capable of doing awful things if he thought they were justified and he knew it. But I never got why he killed Laura. The way he talks about his nieces and nephews \u2013 he really loves them. Everything else he did, I could understand, but that \u2013 I don\u2019t know, Dad. I just feel like it\u2019s worth looking into.\u201d</p>\n<p>Noah studies him thoughtfully for a moment that goes on much longer than Stiles is comfortable with. He\u2019s keenly aware that he\u2019s totally given himself away, that his father knows damned well that Peter is his mystery boyfriend, and that he might or might not choose to have an opinion about it. Finally, he says, \u201cI can get Kate\u2019s phone out of evidence, but I wouldn\u2019t pin your hopes on it. The fire was a long time ago now. Even if they were working together, odds are good that there won\u2019t be any evidence of it now.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles lets out a breath that he hadn\u2019t realized he was holding. \u201cOkay. Thanks, Dad.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNow you get home. You\u2019re still injured and I don\u2019t want you gallivanting around. I\u2019ll be home around six.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Stiles stands and goes around the desk to give his father a hug. \u201cI\u2019ll see you then.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>~ ~ ~ ~</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kate\u2019s phone is just as much of a dead end as Stiles had been afraid it would be. He does a little quiet research on his own that he\u2019s one hundred percent sure his father wouldn\u2019t approve of. Since Derek had been a minor at the time of the fire, his portion of the insurance money and his inheritance had gone into a trust that Laura was the executor of. There\u2019s a lot less in it now than there had been at the beginning. Stiles supposes that some of it might be legitimate withdrawals, that she probably spent plenty of it on Derek or at his request, but he still doesn\u2019t like it.</p>\n<p>Investigating Laura herself was harder than he felt it should have been. She feels like a cipher to him \u2013 a blank slate that other people\u2019s opinions were cast onto. He didn\u2019t <em>know</em> her. It seemed like nobody did. She hadn\u2019t had any friends he could talk to now. She hadn\u2019t had a blog or a journal that he could read.</p>\n<p>Laura\u2019s phone had been given to Derek, after her death, and Stiles has no idea what he had done with it or how he might get it now.</p>\n<p>\u201cI told you that it wouldn\u2019t go anywhere,\u201d Peter says, not looking up from his book while Stiles paces around his apartment, grumbling about all the nothing he\u2019s found. \u201cIt\u2019s not like Laura left a \u2018how to murder my family\u2019 to-do list lying around.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, can we check to see if the tunnel is still blocked off?\u201d Stiles asks. \u201cThat\u2019s evidence in and of itself, right?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cEvidence that somebody betrayed the family on purpose, yes,\u201d Peter says. \u201cEvidence that Laura did it, no. Besides, it\u2019s not a great time to be wandering around in the forest. I seem to recall an overabundance of assassins in Beacon Hills.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Stiles groans. \u201cAnd we\u2019re still no closer to figuring that out, either. Dad tried to fake your death, right? Used the guy\u2019s phone to request payment. But it didn\u2019t go anywhere. Either there was a code word or something, or whoever\u2019s in charge knew you weren\u2019t dead and didn\u2019t pay.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHm.\u201d Peter\u2019s frowning slightly as he considers all this. \u201cI assume they\u2019ve tried to trace the number that the text was going to?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYep. It\u2019s a burner.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course it is.\u201d Peter taps his fingers against the end of the sofa. \u201cIf there was a code word, then it would have to be on the original list, since there\u2019s no evidence that the assassins were corresponding with whoever wrote it. Since there\u2019s not, it means that whoever\u2019s in charge knows I wasn\u2019t dead. How could someone have known?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, Deaton knew,\u201d Stiles says, \u201cbut as much as he\u2019s a shady, cryptic jerk sometimes, I doubt he\u2019s behind this. I mean, I\u2019d consider it if you were the only one targeted, but Deaton would never target Scott.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter nods. \u201cSomeone could have seen me leave the clinic the next day, I suppose.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah. I guess.\u201d Stiles mulls this over. \u201cThis red wolfsbane stuff \u2013 hard to come by?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cExtremely. It\u2019s one of the most potent forms of wolfsbane that a hunter can use. As you\u2019ve seen, even a small amount is lethal, and quickly so.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd there wouldn\u2019t be a lot of people who would just have the antidote lying around,\u201d Stiles says, \u201cso if the guy who nearly got us was known to use it, then whoever\u2019s financing the operation might have known to check Deaton\u2019s after he got the text.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI was gone from Deaton\u2019s by then, though.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cJesus, I don\u2019t know.\u201d Stiles flops down onto the sofa next to Peter. \u201cMy head hurts.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWant me to kiss it and make it better?\u201d Peter asks, with a slight smirk.</p>\n<p>\u201cHell, yes. Though, I mean, you can\u2019t really kiss my brain, which is the part of me that\u2019s hurting right now, but still \u2013 \u201d Stiles is cut off as Peter leans over and gives him a kiss, which was really his intention all along. Peter\u2019s an amazing kisser, and Stiles is left breathless, as usual, by the time Peter pulls away. Stiles pursues his mouth, crawling into Peter\u2019s lap for better leverage. One of Peter\u2019s arms snakes around his waist, his fingers sliding up underneath Stiles\u2019 shirt in the back, just a few inches. Stiles breaks off the kiss so he can hook his fingers under his shirt and pull it off entirely, but Peter gently pushes his hands back down, leaning in to nuzzle at Stiles\u2019 neck. \u201cWhat?\u201d Stiles asks.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat, what?\u201d Peter asks, not pulling away.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy\u2019d you stop me?\u201d Stiles asks, feeling awkward and uncertain. \u201cAm I doing something wrong?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Peter says. \u201cThere\u2019s just no need to be in such a rush.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat if I want to be in a rush?\u201d Stiles asks, leaning back so there\u2019s more space between him and Peter. \u201cI mean, come on, we\u2019ve been dating or whatever you call this for like six weeks now. But we still haven\u2019t even made it to second base with our clothes <em>on</em>, let alone off. What\u2019s up with that?\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter pinches the bridge of his nose. \u201cStiles. I hate to break this to you, but you\u2019re seventeen.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI know that,\u201d Stiles says.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m thirty-four.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI know that, too.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhich means that I can\u2019t have sex with you. You\u2019re underage.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles\u2019 jaw sags. His mouth works for several long moments before he blurts out, \u201cYou\u2019ve <em>killed</em> people! Since when do you give a shit about the law?!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI try not to break the law if I don\u2019t <em>have</em> to, which you well know.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, but \u2013 \u201d Stiles pulls away entirely, getting off the sofa. \u201cBut you don\u2019t have to fucking <em>lie</em> to me, if you don\u2019t want to have sex then just fucking say that, don\u2019t make up bullshit excuses.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cStiles,\u201d Peter says, looking pained. \u201cIt\u2019s not entirely a legal issue, it\u2019s that \u2013 \u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, you know what, forget it,\u201d Stiles says. He shoves his feet into his shoes, cheeks burning with embarrassment. \u201cJust \u2013 just forget it,\u201d he adds, and slams his way out of Peter\u2019s apartment, feeling the rejection down to his bones. What was the point of any of this if Peter doesn\u2019t want him? Is Peter even attracted to him? Is the whole \u2018mates\u2019 thing on a purely psychological level, and now Peter is stuck with a scrawny teenager that he finds repulsive? <em>Is</em> he repulsive? His self-esteem has never exactly been great to begin with, and now he can\u2019t stop thinking about it. If even his werewolf mate doesn\u2019t want him, how disgusting must he be?</p>\n<p>He\u2019s been thumping around in the kitchen, vigorously chopping carrots, for five minutes before his father says, \u201cYou\u2019re in a mood today.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUgh, don\u2019t even ask,\u201d Stiles says, with feeling.</p>\n<p>\u201cMm hm.\u201d Noah pulls out a chair and sits down, watching Stiles move around the kitchen. \u201cFight with your boyfriend?\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles scowls at him. \u201cIt\u2019s ridiculous that you can put your finger on that so quickly.\u201d</p>\n<p>Noah has to hide a smile. \u201cWell, son, I am a detective.\u201d He takes a drink of his beer, still regarding Stiles with some amusement. \u201cYou want to talk about it?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Stiles says, grabbing the peeler. \u201cNo, I do not want to talk about it, because I know you, and, and you\u2019ll <em>agree</em> with him and then I\u2019ll just be pissed at both of you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUh huh,\u201d Noah says. \u201cIf you think I\u2019ll agree with him, it means you privately think he\u2019s right, but just don\u2019t want to admit it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou know, contrary to popular belief, you are not right about everything,\u201d Stiles says, and his father just gives him a skeptical look. \u201cArrrrrg, oh my God, okay, I know you\u2019re going to agree but I just have to vent because he <em>won\u2019t have sex with me</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>Noah chokes on a mouthful of his beer, so that\u2019s satisfying, at least. He manages to clear his throat and says, \u201cUh. All right. Any particular reason why?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBecause! I\u2019m seventeen!\u201d Stiles gestures with a carrot. \u201cI\u2019m underage and he actually cares about that shit! Or so he says. But maybe he just secretly thinks I\u2019m hideous and doesn\u2019t want to hurt my feelings \u2013 \u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re not hideous, and I\u2019m pretty sure he wouldn\u2019t be your boyfriend if he thought you were,\u201d Noah says patiently. \u201cIs your boyfriend over the age of eighteen?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d Stiles mutters.</p>\n<p>\u201cThen you\u2019re right. I agree with him.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUgh, <em>Dad</em>,\u201d Stiles says. \u201cI knew I shouldn\u2019t tell you. It\u2019s a stupid law! What the fuck does it matter? You don\u2019t just turn into a different person on your eighteenth birthday. Does he really think I\u2019m going to be that much more mature in three months than I am now, that some, some switch is going to be flipped in my brain that will magically make me ready for sex? Come on! It\u2019s a, a ridiculous, arbitrary line and I\u2019m not going to front with you, Dad, my boyfriend has broken <em>many</em> laws, so the fact that he cares about this one is just fucking bizarre!\u201d</p>\n<p>Noah gestures and says, \u201cC\u2019mere. Sit down. We\u2019re going to have a talk about this.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles groans and flops dramatically into the chair.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles nearly falls out of the chair as his butt hits it. \u201cWait, what?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s an arbitary line. Most seventeen and nine month old people <em>are</em> ready for sex. Most seventeen and a half year olds are. Some sixteen year olds are. People mature at different rates, and many people are mature enough for sex before they hit their eighteenth birthday. But eighteen was the age at which professionals decided the vast majority of people <em>are</em> ready for sex. They err on the side of caution. To protect people who mature more slowly, who aren\u2019t ready for sex as early as some other people are, they forbid <em>everyone</em> from having sex until that line. Now, is that fair? You could argue either way. But since nobody is being hurt by having to wait an extra few months, I think it\u2019s worth protecting the late bloomers. Don\u2019t you?\u201d</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a pause while Stiles really thinks about that, before he sighs. \u201cYeah. I guess so. Though we could have a long argument about how some people <em>are</em> hurt because they\u2019re penalized for sleeping with an underage person \u2013 \u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut those people made a choice, Stiles. They chose to break a law that\u2019s in place to protect people. I\u2019m not in love with the idea of a nineteen year old getting prosecuted for having sex with a seventeen year old. But unless there was a lack of consent on the nineteen year old\u2019s part, which is a whole other ball of wax, then they should have considered not breaking the law.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, okay, but Pe \u2013 my boyfriend is not really a law-abiding sort of guy. I just don\u2019t get why he cares. <em>If</em> he cares, and didn\u2019t just say that to put me off.\u201d</p>\n<p>Noah sighs. \u201cOkay, I\u2019m trying to avoid making any assumptions about your mystery boyfriend, but I\u2019m assuming when he breaks the law, whatever it is he does, he\u2019s not hurting anybody that he cares about. But he cares about you, he wants to do right by you, so he\u2019s decided to defer to the law\u2019s judgment on the age of consent.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles is a little taken aback by this, by the idea that Peter wants to \u2018do right by him\u2019 in any sort of conventional sense. \u201cUh. I guess. That does kind of make sense.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay. Good talk.\u201d Noah stands up and squeezes his shoulder. \u201cWere you a jerk about it?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDefine \u2018jerk\u2019?\u201d Stiles says, and Noah gives him a look. \u201cWell, I kind of didn\u2019t believe him and accused him of lying to me. Which, okay, was probably the sort of thing a jerk would do.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou might want to think about an apology.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI guess.\u201d Stiles\u2019 nose wrinkles as he gets up and starts working on the carrots again, albeit with less vigor. He finishes making dinner, and they talk about school and lacrosse while he eats. Then he heads over to Peter\u2019s and finds the werewolf on the sofa with a book. \u201cSo, uh, I was a dick,\u201d he says. \u201cSorry.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter looks over the top of his book, and shrugs. \u201cI probably could have explained it better. You know it\u2019s not that I <em>don\u2019t want</em> to have sex with you, right?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah. I get that.\u201d Stiles blinks. \u201cWait. You want to have sex with me?\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter lets his head hit the arm of the sofa and stares at the ceiling. \u201cGood lord. You\u2019re an idiot.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles rubs a hand over the back of his head. \u201cYeah.\u201d He walks over and sits down on the end of the sofa, by Peter\u2019s feet. \u201cAre you attracted to me?\u201d He half-expects Peter to make fun of him, but Peter just nods. \u201cOkay, like, really? You\u2019re actually attracted to a skinny, pale dork like me?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFor one thing, yes,\u201d Peter says, \u201cI would be attracted to you if you were a pale, skinny dork. That\u2019s what you were when I first met you, and I was attracted to you then. Secondly, you should really look in a mirror and update your self-esteem about a year. When the term \u2018glow-up\u2019 was invented, they probably put your picture in the dictionary.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles flushes bright pink. \u201cOkay, no, that is not accurate.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt really is. So yes, Stiles, I am attracted to you, and I want to have sex with you, and you had better tell all your friends that your eighteenth birthday is hereby reserved, because I\u2019m going to spend the entirety of it showing you <em>exactly how much</em> I\u2019m attracted to you and want to have sex with you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay, wow, this room got very hot all of a sudden,\u201d Stiles says, and Peter smirks. Stiles drops his face into his hands and moans. \u201cOh my God. You\u2019re the worst. We can\u2019t have sex yet but you had better prepare yourself for the fact that I\u2019m taking my shirt off next time we make out.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you, now?\u201d Peter swings his feet over the side of the sofa so he\u2019s sitting, and quick as a flash, he has Stiles lying down and pinned beneath him. \u201cWhat if I do this?\u201d</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a knock on the door. Stiles groans and closes his eyes. A moment later, he feels Peter\u2019s weight lift off him. He hears Peter swing the door open and then says, \u201cSheriff Stilinski, to what do we owe the pleasure,\u201d and his eyes pop back open and nearly out of his head.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d he sputters at his father.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, after some things that were said earlier today, I decided it was high time I met this boyfriend of yours,\u201d Noah says, and Stiles flushes bright pink. \u201cI brought a six pack. The Giants are playing the Cubs.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter\u2019s mouth twitches into a smile and he stands back. \u201cCome on in.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPeter!\u201d Stiles protests, but he\u2019s not sure who he\u2019s supposed to be protesting. \u201cDad! What?! Why! How?!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCome on, kid, I\u2019ve known who your mystery boyfriend was ever since that whole thing two weeks ago,\u201d Noah says. \u201cIt was pretty obvious at that point, and if you think Scott and the others don\u2019t know that you two have something going on, you\u2019re deluding yourself. I was trying not to have an opinion, because he had obviously helped you a lot, so despite my initial impulse being to arrest the shit out of him, I held off. And now I\u2019ve heard that there\u2019s nothing I can even arrest him <em>for</em>, at least not in regards to you, so I figured we should get to know each other.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter arches an eyebrow at Stiles and says, \u201cYou told your father about our fight?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUh . . . yes,\u201d Stiles says. He\u2019s cringing a little, but then he rallies and says, \u201cAnd apparently he\u2019s decided that it means he\u2019s not going to chop your nuts off, so maybe you should be okay with that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFair enough,\u201d Peter says, and settles back on the sofa, turning the television on. \u201cWhat channel?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHow do you not know what channel the game is on,\u201d Noah says, rolling his eyes.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s a nerd, like me,\u201d Stiles says cheerfully, snagging Peter\u2019s book and dropping into the armchair. Peter shrugs and accepts this without argument. Noah shakes his head at both of them and cracks open a beer.</p>\n<p>Stiles has never been a big baseball fan. Far too much of the game is repetitive and boring for his taste. Peter gets into it after a little while, although Stiles thinks that he might just be feigning interest in an effort to get on Noah\u2019s good side. Before the game is halfway over, he\u2019s yawning. \u201cYou gonna stay here all night, Dad?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, at least until the game is over,\u201d Noah says, not looking away from the TV. \u201cI mean, what is this screen, forty-eight inches?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFifty-two,\u201d Peter says, somewhat smugly.</p>\n<p>Stiles gives a snort and shakes his head. \u201cOkay, I\u2019m going to bed, then. G\u2019night, Dad.\u201d</p>\n<p>He\u2019s aware that his father is watching him as he heads into Peter\u2019s bedroom, but given the events earlier that day, he\u2019s not really worried about it. He brushes his teeth, strips off his clothes, and crawls into bed. He can still hear the low murmur of the TV in the other room, and it quickly soothes him into sleep.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s rare for him to sleep through the night, and this particular night is no exception. He wakes a few hours later from a bad dream and decides to get up and make himself some tea and see if Peter\u2019s still up.</p>\n<p>Not only is Peter still up, but Noah is still there, too. \u201c \u2013 sleep in there often, then?\u201d is what Noah is saying as Stiles yawns his way towards the door. He stops to listen.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, he started sleeping in there because the cat was pouncing his feet at night,\u201d Peter says, and Noah huffs out a laugh. \u201cBut also because he has fewer nightmares when he\u2019s there. So do I, for that matter.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMm hm.\u201d Noah\u2019s quiet for a minute. \u201cHave to admit that I\u2019ve got some questions for you on that topic.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI figured you did.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI know why you killed Laura,\u201d Noah says, and Peter must make some kind of face, because Noah adds, \u201cThe <em>real</em> reason. My kid is a lot of things, but subtle ain\u2019t one of them. He asked me for help getting Kate\u2019s phone out of evidence. Which amazes me, to be honest, since I\u2019m pretty sure that six months ago he would\u2019ve just broken into the evidence room.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTruth,\u201d Peter says with a snort. \u201cFair enough. So if that\u2019s what you know, what do you not know?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou knew Kate was responsible for the fire, right?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI had a strong suspicion. Although I didn\u2019t actually confirm it until I talked to that chemistry teacher.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut you didn\u2019t have evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Peter says, \u201cbut if you\u2019re trying to turn this into some sort of situation where I didn\u2019t go to the police because of that, you\u2019re going to be disappointed. I won\u2019t lie to you, Sheriff. I could have had a taped, signed confession and a mountain of physical evidence, and I still would have killed her. Would have killed all of them. And if that was because of my bout of insanity, then I must still be insane, because that hasn\u2019t changed.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles lets his head thump against the wall and mutters, \u201cPeter, we want him to like you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, I appreciate your honesty,\u201d Noah says with a sigh. \u201cI think. And if we get into a debate over the death penalty we might be here all night, and I don\u2019t have enough beer for that. So okay. But you also hurt innocent people. Scott, Derek, Lydia \u2013 probably more people even if I don\u2019t know about them.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, that\u2019s true,\u201d Peter says. \u201cI did it to get to Kate. I didn\u2019t hurt them because that was my idea of a good time. Everything I did since I opened my eyes in that hospital room was to get to Kate. I\u2019m well aware that I did reprehensible things, and I won\u2019t pretend otherwise. To me, it seemed worth it. You have every right to disagree.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you regret it?\u201d</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a long moment of silence. Then Peter says, \u201cI regret that I felt it was necessary. I\u2019m not disclaiming responsibility, understand \u2013 only trying to explain how I feel about it. It\u2019s not something I took pleasure from doing. If I had been able to get to Kate without involving another soul, I would have done so. But I can\u2019t undo it. I can\u2019t take it back. All I can do is try to make up for it, now that Kate is gone.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Noah says. He seems to think about that for a moment, before he says again, \u201cYeah, okay. Understand that part of my opinion is based on the fact that Derek seems to want you here \u2013 since he would have happily told you to go to Hell if he didn\u2019t \u2013 and that Scott and Lydia both seem to have accepted your presence even if they don\u2019t like it that much. But since they\u2019re all okay with it, I can be okay with it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMore than fair,\u201d Peter says. There\u2019s the scrape of his chair against the floor as he gets up. \u201cThough I have to admit you haven\u2019t asked me the question I was really expecting.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhich is?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMy intentions towards your son.\u201d</p>\n<p>Noah barks out a laugh. \u201cI don\u2019t need to ask about that. I mean, even if you <em>hadn\u2019t</em> risked your life to save his a few weeks ago, I saw enough tonight to reassure me on that score. Every time Stiles wasn\u2019t looking at you, you were looking at him like he hung the God damned moon. I\u2019m not worried about your intentions.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter clears his throat. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t seem odd to you? That I would be interested in him?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, it doesn\u2019t seem odd. My son is brilliant, determined, devious \u2013 everything you would like in a person. He\u2019s also loyal and brave and a handful of other qualities that I imagine most people would find appealing. Hell, I find it more strange that the others don\u2019t seem to see it. It makes perfect sense to me that someone would fall for my son.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles knows he\u2019s flushed pink, and wonders if his father knows he\u2019s listening. Probably not, although it\u2019s very possible Peter does.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re not worried about his taste in men?\u201d</p>\n<p>Noah sighs. \u201cLook, Peter. There are things about you that I don\u2019t like, that\u2019s for damned sure. But you helped him out of a place so dark that I, I couldn\u2019t go there to help him myself. You were willing to die to protect him. What the hell more could I ask for?\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter quietly lets out a breath. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome. I\u2019m gonna take off, then \u2013 it\u2019s getting late. Tell Stiles if he doesn\u2019t go to school tomorrow, I\u2019m ordering pizza for dinner and he can\u2019t stop me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Now Peter laughs. \u201cI\u2019ll tell him.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>~ ~ ~ ~</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>After some thought, Stiles decides he should come clean about his relationship with Peter to Scott and the others. It feels weird and awkward to not talk about it when he\u2019s ninety percent sure that they know. Hiding it makes it seem like he\u2019s ashamed of it, like he agrees that their inevitable disapproval is warranted.</p>\n<p>He knows that it\u2019s Scott who\u2019s really going to be the problem, so he decides to tackle each of them separately. With Lydia, it\u2019s a casual, \u201cYou know Peter\u2019s my boyfriend, right?\u201d to which she replies with an epic eye roll and a tart, \u201cDuh.\u201d With Derek, it\u2019s the slightly less casual, \u201cSo are you okay with me and Peter being, like, together and shit?\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek gives him a look that clearly implies he wants no part of an actual <em>discussion</em> of this, and says, \u201cWould my opinion make any difference?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Stiles says. \u201cMaybe.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek sighs. \u201cWhatever, Stiles. It\u2019s not my business.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles takes that as a win, since Derek is usually happy to <em>make</em> things his business if he really has an opinion on them. He guesses that Derek feels somewhat conflicted on this, loving the person his uncle used to be but still wary of who he is now. Stiles decides that a more detailed discussion of this can follow after he\u2019s found evidence of what Laura did.</p>\n<p>That leaves Scott, and Stiles knows he won\u2019t be able to have this discussion in four sentences or less. He debates how to handle it until the next time Scott is over at his place. Noah is working night shift, and rather than going over to Peter\u2019s like usual, Stiles invites Scott over to stay the night, since he doesn\u2019t want to be alone in the house.</p>\n<p>They play Call of Duty and eat a ton of nachos and for a while, things are a lot like they used to be. He realizes how much he\u2019s missed it.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo how are things with you and Kira?\u201d he asks, after they\u2019ve worn themselves out and decided to go to bed.</p>\n<p>\u201cThey\u2019re good,\u201d Scott says, and waxes poetic about his amazing girlfriend for a while.</p>\n<p>When he finally runs dry, Stiles says, \u201cSo you wanna ask me your hundred questions about me and Peter now?\u201d</p>\n<p>Scott rolls over so he\u2019s lying on his stomach, chin resting on his arms, so he can face Stiles. \u201cYou don\u2019t mind?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll mind if you\u2019re a jerk about it, but in your shoes, I\u2019d be pretty curious too, so no. Ask whatever you want.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you two, like, dating?\u201d Scott asks immediately.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, basically,\u201d Stiles says, although he doesn\u2019t think he and Peter have done many things that qualify as a traditional date. He supposes that the picnic probably counts, interrupted by assassins though it may have been. \u201cHe\u2019s my boyfriend.\u201d</p>\n<p>Scott\u2019s face scrunches up a little. \u201cAre you . . . in love with him?\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles hesitates. \u201cI don\u2019t know, man. I like him a lot. I guess I might be falling in love with him.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay, but, like. How?\u201d Scott asks.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure I can really answer that question,\u201d Stiles says. \u201cI mean, who knows how or why you fall in love with someone? Yeah, when we met he was off his gourd and did a lot of terrible things. But he\u2019s different now. He is trying so hard to make up for everything back then, but because he doesn\u2019t talk about it, it\u2019s like you don\u2019t see it. He risked his life to save me two weeks ago. He could have run off and left me, but he didn\u2019t.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo he gets an award for that?\u201d Scott asks.</p>\n<p>\u201cSure,\u201d Stiles says with a snort. \u201cHe gets a \u2018not as big a jerk as he could have been\u2019 award.\u201d He sees the blank look on Scott\u2019s face and groans. \u201cI mean, for one thing, he gets my pop culture references. I just <em>like</em> him, Scott. He\u2019s super smart and really funny a lot of the time, and he loves to cook and he loves cats and Star Wars and a lot of the same nerdy things that I like. I don\u2019t know how to explain it any better than that. I understand why it doesn\u2019t make sense to you. You don\u2019t <em>know</em> him. And I\u2019m not blaming you for that, I mean, it\u2019s not like you\u2019ve had any reasons to be his pal. I\u2019m just saying, you would probably understand better if you actually spent some time with him in a non-world-ending, lives-at-stake, emergency situation.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI guess,\u201d Scott says. He lets out a breath. \u201cDoes he make you happy?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Stiles says. \u201cReally.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell . . . okay, then.\u201d Scott\u2019s nose crinkles again, but he adds, \u201cDoes he like the Marvel stuff?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDude, he has a cat named T\u2019Challa.\u201d</p>\n<p>Scott gives a burst of startled laughter. \u201cOkay, well, when the next Avengers movie comes out, maybe he should come with us when we go see it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Stiles can\u2019t help but smile. \u201cThat sounds good.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>~ ~ ~ ~</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Stiles has long considered himself pretty good at solving mysteries. That\u2019s why it\u2019s so annoying to find himself banging his head against not one but two brick walls. There\u2019s literally nothing he can find that links Laura to the fire. He has a few pieces of circumstantial evidence, but nothing that would change the mind of a skeptic.</p>\n<p>He had known it was going to be an uphill battle, but it\u2019s not until he\u2019s staring at his crime wall in defeat that he realizes how badly he had wanted to succeed. Not just for Peter\u2019s sake, but also for Derek\u2019s. He doesn\u2019t know how much longer he can keep the secret from Derek, knowing what he believes about the fire, but he can\u2019t imagine trying to tell him.</p>\n<p>It occurs to him that it\u2019s possible he and Peter are overthinking it. They don\u2019t <em>know</em> that Derek got along with his sister, that he even liked her. He wanted to solve her murder, but that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean he thought she was a great person. For all they know, he could tell Derek \u2018Laura killed your family\u2019 and Derek would just think for a second and then say, \u2018Yeah, that makes sense\u2019.</p>\n<p>But he can\u2019t find a way to bring it up that wouldn\u2019t be awkward or suspicious as hell, so he continues to gnaw on it in the back of his brain while he works on the <em>other</em> brick wall, which is that there are still assassins everywhere.</p>\n<p>At least on that, there\u2019s something to work on. The latest assassin they caught had received an updated list a few days prior, with higher bounties for Peter and Stiles. Peter is somewhat smug about that, because his bounty is now higher than Derek\u2019s, which Stiles is happy to tell him is an idiotic thing to be smug about.</p>\n<p>The list had been sent from another throwaway address, using the wi-fi of another coffee shop. It\u2019s not too far from the first, however, and Stiles and his father think that means he probably lives nearby. It\u2019s not a rich area, though, so Noah is trying to find any evidence of someone there who might have millions of dollars to burn.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat about the e-mail addresses themselves?\u201d Peter asks, perusing the evidence they have so far. \u201cAre they meaningful?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNope. Just gibberish.\u201d Stiles sighs. \u201cWhoever this guy is, he knows what he\u2019s doing.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter frowns thoughtfully. \u201cI can see why a hunter might start a list like this, but I don\u2019t understand why they would hire out rather than just doing it themselves. It\u2019s unlike them, for the most part.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, I don\u2019t know.\u201d Stiles pinches the bridge of his nose. \u201cMaybe we should try to set a trap.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLike, go somewhere and look vulnerable?\u201d Peter looks interested, but then shrugs. \u201cThat might draw out a singular bounty hunter, but it won\u2019t draw out the mastermind. He clearly considers the bounty hunters expendable, so he won\u2019t care if we capture one, and since they don\u2019t know the identity of whoever\u2019s behind this, they can\u2019t give us any information about him.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNrrrrg,\u201d Stiles says, annoyed.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s frustrating. School is finally out and it\u2019s summer and he wants to have fun. He wants to go down to the lake and go swimming, or organize games of Ultimate Frisbee, or do anything other than sit around in protective custody. He stares at the map that his father had drawn of the area around the two coffee shops. \u201cThere\u2019s barely even anything here! Some houses \u2013 not mansions, just regular old houses \u2013 a strip mall or two, an antique shop, an old folks\u2019 home, a park, an elementary school . . .\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAn old folks\u2019 home?\u201d Peter looks up, interested. \u201cIs it a nice one? A lot of those places are very expensive, and we know our adversary has money to burn.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles Googles the name of the facility. \u201cLooks nice, yeah. Twenty-four hour nursing care available, three meals a day in the dining room, all utilities included, biweekly housekeeping . . . you know, if a hunter got too old to keep killing people, and had plenty of money, I can see them deciding that they would hire out.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMaybe I\u2019ll make a few calls . . .\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles looks over at him, amused. \u201cMy dad is the sheriff, remember? Why don\u2019t we let <em>him</em> make a few calls, before you jump headfirst into heist mode.\u201d He texts his father the name of the facility in question and asks if there\u2019s any way they can get a list of residents.</p>\n<p>His phone rings a moment later, and his father sounds uncharacteristically cautious as he says, \u201cWhat made you focus on this facility?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, I dunno, it just seemed to fit,\u201d Stiles says. \u201cWe know our guy has lots of money, and it\u2019s in our search radius. What\u2019s up?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI have to go,\u201d Noah says. \u201cAre you at Peter\u2019s?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah. Why? What\u2019s happening?\u201d Stiles can\u2019t help but feel anxious.</p>\n<p>\u201cI have a theory and if I\u2019m right, I may be able to take care of this, but I want you to stay at Peter\u2019s. I\u2019ll call you later.\u201d</p>\n<p>Noah hangs up, leaving Stiles blinking at his phone. He looks over at Peter, who\u2019s frowning faintly. \u201cWhat the hell did my dad just figure out that we\u2019re still in the dark about?\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter shrugs. \u201cApparently your father is already acquainted with a geriatric psychopath.\u201d</p>\n<p>The words he uses make it click into place for Stiles. He jabs at his phone\u2019s buttons, and when Scott picks up, he demands, \u201cWhere\u2019s Gerard Argent?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Scott sounds confused. \u201cUh, some retirement home \u2013 Allison and I went to see him there that one time \u2013 \u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhich one?\u201d Stiles asks. \u201cDo you remember?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt was on the north side of town. Villa something.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShit, okay, how could we have not seen how <em>obvious</em> this is,\u201d Stiles groans. \u201cOf fucking course Gerard Argent wouldn\u2019t just sit quietly in a nursing home and be like \u2018oh, I guess the werewolves have defeated me\u2019, no, he\u2019s going to recruit a bunch of assassins to kill people. What a fucking dick! Look, Scott, my dad said he was going to \u2018take care of\u2019 things and I\u2019m pretty sure he thinks Gerard is gonna be a lot more of a pushover than he actually is \u2013 \u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll call Derek and meet you there,\u201d Scott says immediately.</p>\n<p>\u201cCool.\u201d Stiles hangs up and pulls on his shoes. Peter is frowning slightly, and Stiles says, \u201cTell me you\u2019re not going to give me some speech about how we should stay here where it\u2019s safe. That\u2019s my <em>dad</em>, asshole.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Peter says patiently. \u201cAlthough I think you\u2019re selling your father short. I\u2019m pretty sure he intends to call in a SWAT team before he decides to take Gerard on. But if you\u2019d like to go, we can go. In fact, you should text Scott and tell him to bring Kira. We\u2019ll need a fresh face.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWill do,\u201d Stiles says, pulling up his text messages. A moment later they\u2019re in the Jeep. Stiles is driving and Peter is on his phone. Stiles doesn\u2019t know who he\u2019s calling, but by the time they\u2019ve reached the retirement community, they know which wing and which room Gerard Argent lives in. They\u2019ve also made a stop at the grocery store to pick up a bouquet of flowers. Derek is waiting for them, and Scott pulls up a few moments later. He and Kira tumble out.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the plan?\u201d Derek asks.</p>\n<p>\u201cFirst order of business is guarding the exits,\u201d Peter says. \u201cGerard is in the main building here, which will help. Derek, take the back. Stiles, take the front. Kira, you\u2019re going to find out if Gerard is in his room.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUh, how?\u201d Kira says, although she looks game.</p>\n<p>Stiles grabs the bouquet out of the passenger\u2019s seat of Peter\u2019s car. \u201cWith these. Go knock on his door, if and when he answers just look confused and say you must have the wrong room.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGot it!\u201d Kira, as usual, looks excited to be taking part in subterfuge.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll be right down the hall from you,\u201d Scott says, without waiting for anyone to tell him where he\u2019s supposed to be.</p>\n<p>Peter doesn\u2019t look annoyed, so Stiles figures that he planned for that. \u201cWhere are you going to be?\u201d he asks Peter.</p>\n<p>\u201cAt the side exit. It\u2019s the closest to Gerard\u2019s room and therefore his most likely exit.\u201d</p>\n<p>Everyone agrees on this plan, and Scott and Kira enter the front. Stiles gets back into the passenger seat of the car because he figures he\u2019ll look less suspicious that way. But it turns out not to matter. Kira texts the group a few minutes later saying, \u2018Nobody is answering his door. What should I do?\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018Come back outside,\u2019 Peter replies, and they congregate back at the front of the building. \u201cWe can try again later, I suppose, but . . .\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut you feel like he\u2019s already beat feet?\u201d Stiles finishes for him, and Peter nods. \u201cHow could he have known we were onto him?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe answer to that will probably depend on your father, so let\u2019s wait for him,\u201d Peter says, and Stiles groans but agrees.</p>\n<p>They end up waiting about half an hour. Derek lingers at the edge of the group in his usual surly silence. Peter\u2019s not very talkative either, mostly because Stiles has struck up a conversation with Scott and Kira about a reality TV show they\u2019ve been bingeing. Peter disdains reality TV and has resisted Stiles\u2019 efforts to get him into the various Iron Chef shows.</p>\n<p>There are several squad cars that show up (Stiles pointed out to Peter that Beacon Hills doesn\u2019t even have a SWAT unit), and Noah sees the waiting group and groans. \u201cHe\u2019s not here,\u201d Stiles calls out to his father.</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to know why you know that,\u201d Noah replies, and continues with his work. It takes time for them to sweep the facility and decide that Gerard truly isn\u2019t there. Finally, he comes over to the group and says, \u201cOkay. Spill.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe were careful,\u201d Stiles says, and tells him about their ruse with Kira.</p>\n<p>\u201cI suppose I should be grateful for that level of subtlety from you,\u201d Noah says with a sigh.</p>\n<p>\u201cPeter\u2019s a good influence on me,\u201d Stiles says cheerfully.</p>\n<p>\u201cNow <em>that</em> is a truly horrifying thought,\u201d Noah says, as Scott chokes on his water. He shakes his head and says, \u201cThere\u2019s no point in sticking around here. Let\u2019s grab a bite to eat and then regroup.\u201d</p>\n<p>Since Stiles insists they can\u2019t get pizza if his father is going to be eating, they get Chinese take-out instead and head back to Derek\u2019s loft as the place with the most room. It\u2019s a little awkward, because Scott keeps shooting Peter wary looks that Peter ignores, and Stiles is desperate to start laying out facts about Laura for Derek, but mostly they eat in silence.</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Noah says, when they\u2019ve finished eating. \u201cSo the good news is, we know who\u2019s behind this now. All we have to do is find him.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd his accomplice,\u201d Peter says, and everyone blinks at him. \u201cHe\u2019s not doing this alone. He\u2019s elderly, infirm, suffering from chronic pain. He almost certainly has at least one person helping him, maybe more than one. He didn\u2019t go out to those shops and send those e-mails by himself. Plus he knew we were coming today. How?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay, but who the hell would help him?\u201d Stiles asks.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s probably one of the staff,\u201d Peter says. \u201cIf I could find someone willing to help me while I was in the long-term care ward, I\u2019m sure Gerard could manage to do the same.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt could also be another resident,\u201d Noah says thoughtfully. \u201cThat place had different kinds of units, parts of it were more like a retirement home than a nursing home. He\u2019d find it more easy to socialize with other residents. They take meals together, have activities together.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cEither is possible,\u201d Peter says, nodding.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s going to be a hell of a lot of possibilities,\u201d Derek says with a scowl. \u201cThere has to be hundreds of people living at that place.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles nods and chews on his lower lip. \u201cIs there anything we can use to cross reference?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIf we can pull Gerard\u2019s financials, then we can see if he made any withdrawals,\u201d Peter says. \u201cSo if he paid somebody to help him, it\u2019ll be in there. But I think that\u2019s less likely than someone helping of their own volition. I would look for anyone who has lost a family member or close friend to supernatural violence.\u201d</p>\n<p>Noah looks up from where he\u2019s been jotting down notes and grimaces. \u201cNot a bad idea. God knows there\u2019s been enough of that around here.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you going to want help going through it all?\u201d Stiles says, looking at his father hopefully.</p>\n<p>Noah gives him a look and says, \u201cDo you have a badge yet?\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles pouts, but Peter clears his throat and says, \u201cActually, you might want to think about letting us help, rather than having your staff sort through it. Because the other cross reference we could use is someone with ties to the police force.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou wanna back that up?\u201d Noah says, sounding a little disgruntled.</p>\n<p>\u201cGerard knew we were coming today. How? There were only a handful of people who knew that we had caught on to the fact that he was behind this, and most of them were on the police force. Also, when the assassin with the red wolfsbane was caught, we tried to request payment on his behalf, but Gerard didn\u2019t respond. He knew either that I was not dead, or that the assassin was in police custody and in no position to request anything. I can\u2019t figure out how he might have known the former, but he easily could have learned the latter if someone on the force was tipping him off.\u201d</p>\n<p>Noah grunts. \u201cGuess I can\u2019t get too high and mighty about the possibility after one of my deputies set Parrish on fire. Okay. We\u2019ll keep it in this room, and we can sort through the suspects together.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIn the meantime, what about finding Gerard himself?\u201d Derek asks. \u201cThat\u2019s the important part.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFind the accomplice, and you\u2019ll find Gerard,\u201d Peter says. \u201cHe\u2019s not going to be living on the streets.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek huffs a little and says, grudgingly, \u201cI guess.\u201d</p>\n<p>Noah shakes his head at them and says, \u201cI\u2019ve got work to do, so I\u2019m going to take off. I\u2019ll probably be late, so Stiles, stay at Peter\u2019s tonight.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Stiles says, and gives his father a hug before he departs.</p>\n<p>Scott is frowning faintly after Noah, and says, \u201cSo your dad, like, knows about you and Peter? He\u2019s okay with it?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes and yes,\u201d Stiles says, and Scott looks a little baffled. Stiles can sense that a Discussion is approaching, and stands up. \u201cC\u2019mon, Peter, let\u2019s go marathon Twin Peaks.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>~ ~ ~ ~</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Given everything that\u2019s going on, Stiles has to admit he\u2019s pretty nervous when his father insists he sits down before they have a talk. He knots his hands in his lap and tries to quell his anxiety. His father had been at the office for almost twenty-four hours straight before coming home and saying he was going to get some sleep, but first they had to talk. He opens with, \u201cSo, we\u2019ve found Gerard\u2019s accomplice.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles blinks. \u201cThat was quick.\u201d</p>\n<p>Noah grimaces a little and says, \u201cPeter was on point, I\u2019ll give him that. I filtered the list of residents and employees by police ties and then searched for family members who had been the victim of a crime, and that narrowed it down to only three possibilities. One of them was a resident who was too sick to have been out and about, another was an employee who worked in the kitchen and wouldn\u2019t have interacted with Gerard directly. The third was a resident named Maisie Lewis. Her son Tony is an officer with the Beacon Hills city police. She also had another son, Glenn, who was a deputy up until last year, when he was killed.\u201d Noah laces and unlaces his fingers. \u201cGlenn was killed by the bomb that the nogitsune planted at the sheriff\u2019s station.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh.\u201d Stiles swallows down the immediate wave of shame and guilt that threatens to consume him. \u201cI . . . oh.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMs. Lewis was already acquainted with Gerard in passing, so I imagine it was not too difficult for him to explain to her what had \u2018really\u2019 happened to her son, and secure her assistance with his plan.\u201d Noah rakes a hand through his hair. \u201cNow, Gerard knew damned well that you and the nogitsune weren\u2019t the same, but Maisie didn\u2019t, and she actually altered Gerard\u2019s list to give you one of the highest bounties. He had originally only put you down for five million.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s . . . super,\u201d Stiles says. \u201cHere I was flattering myself thinking that maybe Gerard actually had some respect for me and had given me that high bounty because he thought I was just that awesome.\u201d</p>\n<p>Noah gives a little snort, but he doesn\u2019t look like he really thinks it\u2019s funny. \u201cI don\u2019t think Gerard has much respect for anybody, to be honest.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m surprised Peter\u2019s wasn\u2019t higher,\u201d Stiles says, thinking this over. \u201cI mean, Peter is the one who killed Kate. You\u2019d think he\u2019d be enemy number one.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI think that was actually deliberate,\u201d Noah says. \u201cI had noticed that the bounties seemed a little oddly weighted and I asked Maisie about it. She said that Gerard priced some of them deliberately low because he didn\u2019t want the bounty hunters to think they were dangerous and avoid them. That\u2019s probably why Peter\u2019s bounty was lower than Derek\u2019s. But he knew he couldn\u2019t get away with that for Scott because everyone knew about the \u2018true alpha\u2019 business.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles nods. \u201cYeah, okay. That makes sense, I guess.\u201d</p>\n<p>Noah reaches out and squeezes his shoulder. \u201cYou okay?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI guess so. I don\u2019t know.\u201d Stiles hunches his shoulders a little, folding his arms over his stomach. \u201cI know that I didn\u2019t kill Deputy Lewis. And that, that feeling that I should have fought harder, should have found a way to stop the nogitsune from doing it, I know that that\u2019s irrational. It just . . . it\u2019s still so hard to <em>not feel</em> it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI know.\u201d Noah draws him into an embrace, and Stiles rests his face against his father\u2019s shoulder for a few moments. \u201cI know that I can\u2019t imagine what that\u2019s like. Just know that any time you want to talk, I\u2019m here. Okay?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah. Okay.\u201d Stiles wipes his eyes and pulls away. \u201cSo, uh, you talked to her? Ms. Lewis? She admitted it and stuff?\u201d he asks, and his father nods. \u201cWhat\u2019s going to happen to her? I don\u2019t want her to get arrested or anything.\u201d</p>\n<p>Noah sighs. \u201cShe\u2019s an accessory to murder, Stiles. You aren\u2019t the only person that Gerard targeted. The two people who were killed by the bounty hunters were both totally innocent, as far as we can tell.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI know, but . . .\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMs. Lewis being upset about her son being killed is perfectly natural,\u201d Noah says, \u201cbut being killed in the line of duty is something that police officers accept as a possibility. If Glenn had been killed by a black man, and Ms. Lewis helped someone start a mission to kill all black men, would you think she shouldn\u2019t be held accountable for that?\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles winces. \u201cNo.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo. The only difference is that Gerard clearly manipulated her and fed her false information about supernatural creatures. And believe me, Stiles, I am going to take that into account. I haven\u2019t decided what to do yet, to be honest. I\u2019m not sure bringing charges against her is even a possibility. I can\u2019t explain to a jury that Gerard started a bounty list for monsters, and I\u2019m not sure how else I could explain the list\u2019s existence. There\u2019s a lot to think about, but we\u2019ll figure it out.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles nods and wipes his eyes again. \u201cOkay. So, uh, if we know who the accomplice is, can we find Gerard?\u201d</p>\n<p>Noah grimaces a little. \u201cI haven\u2019t had any luck with that so far. I guess Maisie\u2019s son Tony was keeping an ear out, and when I called in the backup to go down to the retirement home, he tipped Gerard off. Maisie was still home, but Tony didn\u2019t show up to work today. We checked his place and it\u2019s empty, so we\u2019re monitoring his credit cards to see if he turns up. Plus we\u2019ve got a tap on his mom\u2019s phone.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Stiles sighs. \u201cKeep me posted?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWill do. And no going out alone until this is over.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat if I want to go to Peter\u2019s?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHave him come pick you up.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUgh, <em>Dad</em> \u2013 \u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI mean it, Stiles. Gerard knows we\u2019re onto him. He\u2019s going to be even more reckless and dangerous now. Until he\u2019s caught, I don\u2019t want you out by yourself, even if it\u2019s just to drive to Peter\u2019s. He can come over here or he can come pick you up. End of story.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles sighs. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p>\n<p>So after his father has gone to get some sleep, Stiles dutifully texts Peter to say, \u2018Wanna come hang out? Or pick me up? My father has decreed I\u2019m not to go out alone.\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018Okay,\u2019 Peter replies a minute later. \u2018Have you eaten?\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018No, but don\u2019t go to the grocery. It\u2019s not really safe for you out there, either. We can order.\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018All right. I\u2019ll be there in about twenty minutes. Don\u2019t leave the door unlocked \u2013 I\u2019ll ring the bell when I get there.\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018Okay,\u2019 Stiles replies, and flops down on the sofa to wait. He plays on his phone for a little while and surfs through Netflix to see if there\u2019s anything new out that he and Peter might like. He\u2019s been meaning to try Santa Clarita Diet, which he\u2019s heard is good. He glances up when the doorbell rings and jogs over to answer it.</p>\n<p>The man at the door is not Peter. He\u2019s taller, well muscled and wearing a T-shirt and jeans. Stiles starts to swing the door shut, but it\u2019s too late. The man grabs him by the wrist, and jams a stun gun into Stiles\u2019 side. There\u2019s a shock of pain and then blackness.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>~ ~ ~ ~</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Stiles jerks awake in the back of a car. His hands are handcuffed behind his back, and there\u2019s duct tape over his mouth. He makes a muffled noise and tries to squirm free, but there\u2019s no reaction from the driver of the car. He doesn\u2019t even turn his head.</p>\n<p>A few minutes later, the car pulls into the parking lot of what looks like an old garage. Stiles is unceremoniously hauled out of the back of the car and dragged inside, practically tripping over his own feet. He\u2019s shoved into a chair, and the handcuffs are momentarily removed so they can be put back on to secure him to the chair.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat the fuck,\u201d he tries to say through the duct tape, as he looks over to the other side of the room and sees that both Derek and Peter have already been brought there and secured to what looks like a chain link fence. From the looks of the wires and the equipment on the nearby table, Gerard is using voltage to keep them from shifting and breaking free.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, I see almost everyone is here,\u201d Gerard says, and steps over to rip the tape off Stiles\u2019 mouth.</p>\n<p>He manages to hold back the yelp of pain and instead looks at Peter and Derek and says, \u201cDid you two seriously get captured by a vanilla mortal?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cExcuse you,\u201d Peter says, his voice a little hoarse. \u201cHe sabotaged my perfect automobile.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, geez,\u201d Stiles says, with a nervous laugh. He should be terrified, but he\u2019s not having much of an emotional reaction yet. More than anything, he just feels annoyed. He thinks about asking Derek what had happened to him, but really, when has he ever seen Derek win a fight? He laughs again, sounding a little hysterical, and tries to calm down. \u201cAlmost everyone? I guess we\u2019re waiting for Scott, huh?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNaturally,\u201d Gerard says. \u201cHe\u2019d be tricky to capture, but once he knows you\u2019re here, he\u2019ll charge right in without stopping to think about the consequences. Then I\u2019ll be able to take care of everyone who destroyed my family.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFuck you and fuck your family,\u201d Derek retorts. \u201cYour family was a batch full of psychopaths with a couple rare exceptions.\u201d</p>\n<p>Gerard tsks, something that makes Stiles rattle the handcuffs in his sudden need to punch the old man across the face. \u201cYour air of superiority is ironic, considering what your family was like.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek looks momentarily confused, but then glances at Peter, remembers everything Peter\u2019s done. His jaw sets in that surly, angry expression that he used to wear all the time, when he first came to Beacon Hills. \u201cMaybe my family wouldn\u2019t be such a disaster if it weren\u2019t for yours.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou think so?\u201d Gerard says, and looks over at Tony, who\u2019s standing at the door, clearly guarding the exit. He gestures the man over, and says, \u201cYou see what happens when you give these animals an inch. They start thinking they\u2019re human. They don\u2019t understand that they, all of them, are controlled by their base instincts.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek rattles the chains, and Gerard turns the dial up on the equipment. Derek\u2019s body goes rigid, the cords of his neck standing out. Peter snarls, which earns him a dose of the same treatment. Stiles mutters profanities underneath his breath and struggles to get free. He\u2019s read somewhere that there\u2019s a trick to getting out of handcuffs, something about breaking one\u2019s own thumb, but he doesn\u2019t know how to go about it.</p>\n<p>After a moment, Gerard turns the dial back down for Derek, but not for Peter. Still addressing Tony, he says, \u201cThis man murdered my beautiful daughter, and do you know what? He thinks it was justified. That he had every right to do it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter tries to control his shaking underneath the voltage, and manages to grit out, \u201cAnd you won\u2019t change my mind.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd this is what they don\u2019t understand, no matter how many times they\u2019re taught the lesson,\u201d Gerard says. \u201cThat their bloodlust, their desire for revenge, for carnage, is all that drives them. They \u2013 \u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHey, why don\u2019t you shut up, fucknugget?\u201d Stiles calls over. \u201cDo you <em>ever</em> stop talking? I mean, seriously, that\u2019s coming from <em>me</em>. Are you seriously going to talk about the desire for revenge like it\u2019s a bad thing when you\u2019ve <em>literally</em> got us all chained up in some abandoned building for the purpose of getting exactly that?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not revenge,\u201d Gerard says. \u201cIt\u2019s justice. An eye for an eye.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHow the hell is that different from what Peter did?\u201d Stiles retorts. \u201cKate killed his family, so he killed her. Justice! Let\u2019s all go home.\u201d</p>\n<p>Gerard gives a cold smile and says, \u201cKate might have killed the Hale family, but she had her reasons.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUh, yeah, because she was a psycho who liked to murder people,\u201d Stiles says.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou never met Talia Hale, did you,\u201d Gerard says, walking over to the table that contains a briefcase. He opens it up and rummages around for a few moments. Stiles can\u2019t see what he\u2019s doing. \u201cYou don\u2019t know what she was like. Territorial, calculating, vicious. She arranged the death of more than one person who strayed across her borders. She ruled that family with an iron fist.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShut the fuck up,\u201d Derek snarls. \u201cThat\u2019s my mother you\u2019re talking about.\u201d</p>\n<p>Gerard gives a snort of laughter. \u201cYour mother, who set up Deucalion to be murdered because she didn\u2019t like the way he spoke to her. Your mother, who stole your uncle\u2019s child and then stole the memory of her on top of it. Your mother, who kept her entire family so oppressed that her oldest son fled into the arms of the first woman to show him a scrap of affection without ever even thinking that it might be a trap.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek sucks in a breath, and Stiles and Peter both wince. After a moment, Derek manages to growl, \u201cYou don\u2019t know anything about us.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, I know all about you,\u201d Gerard says, with a confident smile. He turns away from the briefcase, although his hands are empty, and taps at the dial on the voltage machine. But he doesn\u2019t turn it. He knows that his words are more painful than anything else ever could be. \u201cDo you think Kate didn\u2019t keep me apprised on what was going on here? That she didn\u2019t tell me all about your dysfunctional pack?\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter looks up suddenly, like he\u2019s scenting danger. His mouth works for a moment, but all he manages to say is, \u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t know, does he,\u201d Gerard says, with a cruelly pleased smile. \u201cAbout Laura.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Don\u2019t</em>,\u201d Peter repeats.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat about Laura?\u201d Derek says.</p>\n<p>\u201cNothing about Laura, don\u2019t listen to this crusty old wart on the butt of humanity,\u201d Stiles interrupts, talking loudly. \u201cHe\u2019s nothing but a fucking liar, we <em>know</em> that, he lies all the time \u2013 \u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNot when the truth hurts worse,\u201d Gerard says, still smirking. \u201cDon\u2019t get me wrong, Kate was going to kill your family one way or another, but when Laura got on her tracks \u2013 well, she could have killed Kate, but no, she had a better idea. Because Laura wanted to get rid of your precious mother, wanted to be the alpha she knew she was destined to be.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek has gone very still. He shakes his head and says, \u201cThat\u2019s not true.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLaura had wanted to kill Talia for years, but she knew she\u2019d never get away with it, that suspicion would immediately fall on her. But, hm, if <em>everyone</em> was killed \u2013 if she just happened to be one of the few survivors of an attack \u2013 well, who could suspect her then, right? Nobody did.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShut up!\u201d Derek shouts.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, except Peter, of course,\u201d Gerard says, and laughs as he turns up the dial on Peter\u2019s voltage. He grunts, his body thrashing against the chainlink fencing. \u201cShe crippled him and then left him to die. Hadn\u2019t you ever wondered why he <em>really</em> killed her? Tell me you didn\u2019t buy that excuse that he lost control.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh my God, stop!\u201d Stiles yells, nearly tipping the chair over in his attempts to escape. Tony grabs it before he can fall. \u201cWe fucking get the picture, now shut the fuck up!\u201d</p>\n<p>Gerard\u2019s smile falls off his face. He turns the voltage back down. Peter pants and gasps for breath, involuntary tears rolling down his cheeks. Derek is staring at him like he\u2019s a complete stranger. \u201cSorry,\u201d Peter manages to gasp out. \u201cDerek. Sorry.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIs it true?\u201d Derek asks.</p>\n<p>Peter closes his eyes, his body sagging in the restraints, and nods.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou son of a bitch,\u201d Derek says, his voice shaking. \u201cHow the hell could you hide that from me? After \u2013 after everything that happened, with, with Kate, I thought \u2013 I thought \u2013 \u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, by the way, that was Laura\u2019s idea,\u201d Gerard says casually. \u201cShe figured they should leave at least one either survivor, and she knew that you\u2019d be easy to manipulate, that the first time a woman smiled at you, you\u2019d be head over heels. She even managed to convince your mother that your sudden crush was just a little puppy love, nothing to worry about. It\u2019s a shame she was a werewolf, you know,\u201d he adds thoughtfully. \u201cI feel like she and I could have been great friends.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter\u2019s body shudders. Derek\u2019s face has gone into that stoic, distant, \u2018nothing can touch me\u2019 expression.</p>\n<p>\u201cBut you know what, for a little while I really did figure I had lost fair and square,\u201d Gerard says. \u201cGetting outsmarted by a teenager \u2013 that hurt, it genuinely did. I took it as a sign that maybe I had gotten too old for this shit. Take the loss, throw an occasional taunt your way, stay where it was secure. But then you.\u201d His gaze swings to Stiles. \u201cYou went and killed my only granddaughter.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe fuck I did,\u201d Stiles retorts.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, are you going to say that you were possessed, that it wasn\u2019t your fault?\u201d Gerard asks, with a sneer. \u201cLike you couldn\u2019t have stopped it? You know what I found really interesting about the story of Glenn\u2019s death?\u201d he adds, and Tony looks over at this, his face creasing into a scowl. \u201cThat the sheriff wasn\u2019t there. He had to go respond to an emergency \u2013 something that the nogitsune had done. Now, the Void would have wanted him in the station \u2013 which means that <em>you</em> did something to lure him away.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles chokes back the feelings of doubt and guilt that have plagued him for months. \u201cI just managed to time it right. I didn\u2019t do anything it didn\u2019t want to do.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou could have saved more than just him, couldn\u2019t you?\u201d Gerard says. \u201cYou could have saved Glenn. And I\u2019m sure you could have managed to find a way to save Allison. Were you jealous of her, Stiles? How she suddenly had all your best friend\u2019s attention? Did you <em>want</em> her gone? Did you not trust her, after what happened with Erica and Boyd, with the kanima?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t like that!\u201d Stiles says, aware he\u2019s being baited, but unable to bite back the response.</p>\n<p>\u201cSure it wasn\u2019t,\u201d Gerard says. \u201cShe\u2019s dead either way, though, and that\u2019s because of you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles loses his temper, and the words flood out of him so fast that they nearly trip over themselves. \u201cNo, you asshole, it\u2019s because of <em>you</em>! The nogitsune killed Allison! It got free because we woke the Nemeton, which we had to do to find our parents after Jennifer Blake kidnapped them, which she did because she wanted revenge on Deucalion! And Deucalion was nuts because of what <em>you</em> did to him! <em>You</em> are the one who did this, who did all of this, who, who soaked this entire town in hatred and violence and, and pointless fucking cruelty! Allison was my friend! I would never, <em>ever</em> have let anything happen to her if I could have prevented it! Don\u2019t you fucking <em>dare</em> stand there and say that her death was my fault when you\u2019re the author of every bad thing that\u2019s happened in this town since the God damned advent of disco!\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter practically chokes on the half-laugh he gives at Stiles\u2019 speech. Gerard\u2019s mouth tightens into a thin line, and he\u2019s about to speak when Stiles keeps going, this time directing his words at Tony. \u201cLook, Officer Lewis, I\u2019m sorry about your brother, I honestly am. I don\u2019t have any siblings but I know what it\u2019s like to lose someone, and I know that, that you must hurt so much that sometimes it feels like taking it out on other people is the only way to make it stop. You wanna hunt supernatural monsters, I will give you the number of the best hunter I know so you can get some training and do it right. But this guy is the fucking <em>devil</em> and you might wanna stop listening to a word he has to say.\u201d</p>\n<p>Tony is looking between Gerard and Stiles with a faint frown on his face. He shakes his head and says, \u201cYou\u2019ve got too much blood on your hands for me to let you go. It\u2019s better for everyone\u2019s safety.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThen kill me,\u201d Stiles says, holding his gaze, and hears Peter give a little hiss between his teeth. \u201cKill me if you want. Pick up your gun, pull the trigger. But once you\u2019re done you\u2019d better turn that gun on Gerard, because he\u2019s got more blood on his hands than every criminal you\u2019ve ever arrested, every criminal you\u2019ve ever <em>seen</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>Tony hesitates, and Gerard says dryly, \u201cMaybe hold off on that, Officer, until McCall has arrived. I still need Stilinski alive until then.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t see why,\u201d Stiles says. \u201cIt\u2019s not like we have a psychic link. He\u2019ll still show up even if I\u2019ve stopped breathing.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cStiles, could you please court death a <em>little</em> less actively?\u201d Peter interjects here, sounding exasperated.</p>\n<p>Stiles gives a shrug. Gerard shakes his head at them and turns back to the table where he has his things. Silence sits in the room for a long minute.</p>\n<p>Finally, Derek looks at Peter and says quietly, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me?\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter doesn\u2019t look at him, instead staring straight ahead as he admits, \u201cI didn\u2019t know how.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI thought \u2013 it was my fault.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI know.\u201d Peter closes his eyes. \u201cBut you wouldn\u2019t have believed me, Derek. And I just \u2013 you already hated me so much for what I had done. The idea that you would think I was lying about why I did it, trying to make excuses or manipulate you into forgiveness, the idea that you would hate me even more \u2013 I couldn\u2019t risk that. You.\u201d His voice chokes up slightly. \u201cYou were all I had left.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek looks down at the floor, and Stiles feels tears sting in his eyes.</p>\n<p>\u201cHow sentimental,\u201d Gerard drawls.</p>\n<p>Stiles\u2019 temper snaps again. \u201cOh my God! Shut up, shut up, just <em>shut the fuck up</em> \u2013 \u201d</p>\n<p>The door bangs open. Scott is standing there, claws out and fangs bared, eyes a vivid crimson. But before he can move, Gerard is behind Stiles and has a syringe pressed into Stiles\u2019 neck. Sheriff Stilinski comes up behind Scott, and they both go still. \u201cGood,\u201d Gerard says, when he sees them freeze. \u201cSheriff, why don\u2019t you get on your radio and call off your men.\u201d</p>\n<p>Noah nods. He takes out his radio and says, \u201cBack up to the perimeter,\u201d before hooking it back on his belt.</p>\n<p>\u201cCome on in, Scott,\u201d Gerard says. \u201cUp against the fence, there, if you want your friend to live.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t do it, Scotty,\u201d Stiles says. \u201cHe\u2019s just gonna kill me anyway, you know he is, he\u2019s going to kill all of us \u2013 \u201d</p>\n<p>Scott has moved a few steps into the room, but he stops when Stiles says that, his face twisting in indecision.</p>\n<p>\u201cBetter do as you\u2019re told, Scott,\u201d Gerard says. \u201cDo you have any idea what a dose of wolfsbane this big would do to a human? A wolf would die quick, but a human, well, he\u2019d linger for hours. You\u2019d never get to me before I \u2013 \u201d</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a noise so loud that Stiles yelps; two thunderous pops that he flinches away from. The syringe scratches his throat as Gerard staggers backwards before collapsing in a heap. Stiles\u2019 gaze snaps up to where his father is standing, his gun raised and still pointed at the space just above him.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s so sudden that everyone just stares for a moment. Then Scott leaps forward, catching Tony in a tackle and taking him to the floor before he can get to his own weapon. Noah is jogging forward, grabbing the set of keys on the table and then dialing the voltage all the way down to zero. Both Derek and Peter let out soft gasps of relief despite themselves.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou okay, did he hurt you?\u201d Noah asks, kneeling in front of his son.</p>\n<p>Stiles manages to shake his head. \u201cI mean, they tased me to get me here, but after that he just talked a lot.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Noah is back on his radio, calling for an ambulance, but certainly in no hurry to administer medical care to Gerard. He gets the handcuffs off Stiles, and then puts a set of his own on Tony, having him kneel against one wall. Scott frees Derek and Peter, the former of whom thanks him, the latter of whom says nothing.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou just . . .\u201d Scott looks down at Gerard\u2019s body, and then back up at Sheriff Stilinski. \u201cYou just shot him.\u201d</p>\n<p>Noah nods. But his tone is kind, gentle, as he says, \u201cSometimes that\u2019s what I have to do, to keep people safe.\u201d</p>\n<p>Scott swallows hard and turns away. Noah squeezes his shoulder.</p>\n<p>Stiles sees that Peter is hanging onto the fence for balance, and gets an arm around him, helping support him. \u201cCome on, we should get you two somewhere that you can get some rest. Dad, are you going to need me to give a statement right now?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI can get it from you later,\u201d Noah says. \u201cYou\u2019re right; it\u2019s more important that you all get somewhere safe right now. Scott, why don\u2019t you drive them back to your house? Your mom can check Stiles over and make sure he doesn\u2019t need medical attention.\u201d</p>\n<p>Scott nods. \u201cYeah. Okay.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>~ ~ ~ ~</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Peter passes out on the way to the McCall house. Derek quietly mentions that Gerard had used a lot of voltage on him while they were waiting for Tony to arrive with Stiles. \u201cHe knew about the way Peter had made Kate apologize, and he was trying to force Peter to do the same thing,\u201d Derek says, \u201cbut Peter wouldn\u2019t.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles is worried, but he knows that healing takes a lot of energy, so he doesn\u2019t try to wake Peter. Derek carries him into the house and lays him down on the sofa. Scott hovers awkwardly while Melissa checks Stiles over and proclaims him in good health.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo, uh, you hungry?\u201d Scott asks.</p>\n<p>It seems like a year ago that Stiles had been texting Peter about ordering some dinner. \u201cStarved, actually.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll go pick us up something,\u201d Scott says.</p>\n<p>Stiles nods and says, \u201cBe careful. There are still assassins out there. I mean, I get that news will spread that Gerard was the one bankrolling the effort and now he\u2019s dead, but it won\u2019t have happened yet.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll be careful,\u201d Scott promises. \u201cLa Carreta? I can get, like, a thousand tacos.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSounds great,\u201d Stiles says. \u201cOh, make sure Peter\u2019s don\u2019t have cilantro, though. He hates the stuff.\u201d</p>\n<p>Scott glances between the two of them, but then nods and says, \u201cSure thing,\u201d before he departs.</p>\n<p>Once he\u2019s gone, and the silence is starting to settle in, Derek says, \u201cI remember that. Peter hating cilantro. Mom used to tease him about his delicate tastebuds. He told her he had that special gene that made it taste like soap. But later he told me that he didn\u2019t really, he just hated it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles is smiling despite himself. \u201cYeah, he told me that story.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek sits down on the floor in front of the sofa, leaning his back against it. \u201cMy mom wasn\u2019t . . . she wasn\u2019t what Gerard was saying. She wasn\u2019t a bad person. She was strict, yeah, and she had really high expectations of us. I love her, loved her, but she didn\u2019t make life easy. And I remember how Peter . . .\u201d A little smile touches his own face. \u201cPeter was the one person who was never intimidated by her. He knew exactly how to push her buttons and tease her to the point where she was just exasperated.</p>\n<p>\u201cGrowing up, Peter was always my favorite uncle. I had another, and an aunt, but they were more like my mom, more traditional. Peter was the youngest, and he was closer to Laura and me in age than he was to most of his siblings, so he was more like a big brother than an uncle. And he always knew how to get my mom to lighten up on us for a bit, or how to get around her when he couldn\u2019t. Peter\u2019s the one who taught me that if I wanted to read comics in bed, I had to use a dark blanket to hide the light. He taught me how to scoop lima beans off my plate one at a time so Mom wouldn\u2019t see that I wasn\u2019t eating them. And he . . .\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek\u2019s voice trails off. Stiles sits down on the floor across from him, watching Peter sleep.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s so hard to think about Laura . . . doing any of what Peter says. But at the same time, I can . . . I can see it. Because she <em>did</em> want to get away from my mom. She always talked about it. After the fire, when we went to New York, she left me alone a lot. She told me she was working, but later I realized she wasn\u2019t. We had more than enough money from the insurance and everything. She just wanted to go out, have a good time, be . . . be <em>free</em>, I guess.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhen Peter told me he lost control, I accepted that because it was so hard to think of him purposefully hurting her, any of us. I didn\u2019t really believe it, but I <em>wanted</em> to believe it. Knowing what she did, though . . . it must have killed him. I just wish he had told me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles pulls his legs up to his chest, loosely draping his arms over them. \u201cHe wanted to, but God, he was so afraid that you wouldn\u2019t believe him. He made me promise not to tell you. I only found out because he was talking about it while he was delirious after that dose of red wolfsbane \u2013 he tried to deny it when I brought it up later. He didn\u2019t want anybody to know. And I know that part of the reason is because he feels guilty that he didn\u2019t see it coming, didn\u2019t find a way to prevent it.\u201d</p>\n<p>A faint frown crosses Derek\u2019s face. \u201cI don\u2019t know why he would have.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThere isn\u2019t a reason, not really. But when we were talking about Allison, he told me that when something so unfair happens, your mind struggles to find a way to prevent it, even if rationally you know there wasn\u2019t anything you could have done.\u201d</p>\n<p>After a moment, Derek nods. \u201cYeah. That\u2019s sure as hell true.\u201d</p>\n<p>When he falls silent again, Stiles says, \u201cIt\u2019s not how I would have wanted you to find out, but I\u2019m glad you know.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah. Me too.\u201d Derek glances over his shoulder at where Peter is still sleeping. \u201cFor what it\u2019s worth . . . I\u2019m glad that he had you. That he wasn\u2019t alone.\u201d Derek\u2019s throat works as he swallows hard. \u201cWe\u2019re not made to be alone.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI know,\u201d Stiles says. \u201cAnd now neither of you will be anymore.\u201d</p>\n<p>After a moment, Derek nods. \u201cYeah. Thanks.\u201d He turns slightly so he can rest his head against the sofa, reaches out and curves a hand around Peter\u2019s wrist. It\u2019s not much, but Peter seems to be able to sense his presence, the proximity of pack, and his body relaxes further into sleep. Derek closes his eyes, too.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>~ ~ ~ ~</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Stiles doesn\u2019t want to wake Derek and Peter when Scott gets back with the food, but he knows that they need to eat. \u201cEvery time I got injured, I ate like a horse afterwards,\u201d Scott says, as he opens up the bag with the food. So Stiles rouses both of them and ushers them over to the table. They both set to the food like, well, wolves.</p>\n<p>Noah comes in about half an hour later, looking a little tired but otherwise all right. He takes two of the tacos, gets a beer out of the refrigerator, and sits down at the table with them. \u201cSo,\u201d he says, \u201cStiles, I will need you to come give a statement tomorrow. For simplicity\u2019s sake, we\u2019re not involving Peter and Derek. We\u2019re just saying that Gerard targeted you because he blamed you for Allison\u2019s death. I came to get you, and shot Gerard because he pointed a lethal weapon at you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s really dead, right?\u201d Peter asks, looking up. \u201cTruly? We\u2019ve double checked?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTriple checked,\u201d Noah says, and some of the tension leaves Peter\u2019s shoulders. \u201cTo the point where I have an officer in the morgue to make sure nothing happens to his body. I\u2019ve spoken to Chris Argent and he\u2019s agreed that cremation is a fine idea. That will be done tomorrow.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMan, poor Mr. Argent,\u201d Scott says. \u201cI mean . . . in less than a year and a half, he lost his sister, his wife, his daughter . . . and now his father, too.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t think Chris will be shedding any tears over Gerard\u2019s death,\u201d Stiles says.</p>\n<p>\u201cMaybe not. I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s still his dad.\u201d Scott studies his tacos as he speaks. \u201cWhen you lose people . . . sometimes it\u2019s the ones you have a complicated relationship with that are the hardest.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter nods at this and says, \u201cYou aren\u2019t just grieving what was. You\u2019re grieving what could have been.\u201d</p>\n<p>Scott looks up, a little startled, but then nods and says, \u201cYeah.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat happened to the Argent family is sad,\u201d Noah says, reaching out to squeeze Scott\u2019s shoulder, \u201cbut ultimately, it didn\u2019t have a lot to do with any of us. Gerard was a poison in that family. Would Kate have still been who she was if she had been raised by someone different? I don\u2019t know. That\u2019s a question none of us will ever have the answer to. But Kate, Victoria, Gerard . . . they wrote the endings to their own stories. And as tragic as Allison\u2019s death was, she died fighting for what she felt was right, protecting people who couldn\u2019t protect themselves . . . and I think the best way to honor that is to try to continue to live by her ideals.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles feels tears sting at his eyes, and he has to knuckle them away. \u201cYeah, that\u2019s . . . that\u2019s a good way to think about it. Thanks, Dad.\u201d</p>\n<p>Noah reaches one arm out and briefly pulls Stiles against him, giving him a hard half-hug. \u201cChris also said he would reach out to a number of his contacts to make sure the news of Gerard\u2019s death, and the corresponding lack of impetus for bounty hunters to come here, made the rounds as quickly as possible. I think we\u2019ll all want to be careful for a week or two, but that should put an end to it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter nods, finishes chewing the last bite of his taco, and stands. \u201cOn that cheerful note, I\u2019m going to need a ride home.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, what exactly did that guy do to your car?\u201d Derek asks.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe blew it to hell, with me in it,\u201d Peter says, scowling. \u201cThen tased me while I was wondering what had just happened. The piece of shit.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going to happen to Officer Lewis?\u201d Stiles asks his father.</p>\n<p>Noah gives his son a look. \u201cHe assaulted and abducted you with the express intention of murdering you, so please don\u2019t tell me you think I shouldn\u2019t press charges.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles winces. \u201cI just, I feel bad for him.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe fact that his brother died was awful,\u201d Noah says, \u201cbut thousands, millions of people lose their brothers without murdering anyone who might have been even remotely involved with their death. Deputy Lewis was an officer of the law and he knew the risks his post entailed, especially in a place like this one.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI know, but . . .\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut you\u2019re trying to let him off the hook for everything because you still feel responsible for the deaths the nogitsune caused,\u201d Peter interrupts. \u201cYou feel like you deserved to be targeted, abducted, possibly even murdered. But that\u2019s not true, and you know it\u2019s not true, so shut up.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles makes a face at him and says nothing.</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay, probably not the most tactful way to phrase it, but accurate,\u201d Noah says, rubbing a hand over his face. He looks at Stiles and says, \u201cOkay?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, okay,\u201d Stiles says, grumbling a little despite himself.</p>\n<p>Noah reaches out and tousles Stiles\u2019 hair. \u201cPeter, Derek, I won\u2019t tell you what to do, but I think it\u2019d be better if we all stayed in one place tonight. There are still assassins out there, and you\u2019re both weak from everything that happened today.\u201d He sees the look of uncertainty on Peter\u2019s face and adds, \u201cIf you aren\u2019t comfortable with that, Derek can stay here with Scott tonight, and Peter, you can come back to our house with me and Stiles.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m fine with staying here if everyone else is fine with it,\u201d Peter says, decidedly not looking at Derek.</p>\n<p>Derek sighs explosively and says, \u201cFor God\u2019s sake, Uncle Peter, stop making it weird. We\u2019ll stay here tonight. Safety in numbers.\u201d</p>\n<p>A tiny smile touches Peter\u2019s face. \u201cAs you say, nephew.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek gives him a wary look. \u201cAre we going to have to talk about this?\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter hesitates, then says, \u201cJust tell me whether or not you believe me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d Derek says. \u201cI believe you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAll right.\u201d Peter sits back down.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo,\u201d Stiles says, reaching out and curling his hand around Peter\u2019s forearm. \u201cYou still look wiped out, and honestly I just wanna cuddle right now. There, I said it. Let\u2019s go upstairs and I\u2019ll show you where the guest room is and you can get some sleep.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI suppose if you insist,\u201d Peter says, putting up no fight whatsoever as Stiles tugs him to his feet and up the stairs. In fact, he\u2019s still yawning as he toes off his shoes and crawls underneath the blankets that Stiles lifts up for him. Stiles shucks off his jeans and crawls in after him, lying on his side so they\u2019re facing.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey,\u201d he says, and Peter\u2019s eyes, which had been sagging shut, open again. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m . . . better than I have been,\u201d Peter says. \u201cFor a long time. Today was awful. Derek finding out the truth was exactly as hard as I expected it would be. But at least it\u2019s done now, and there\u2019s a lot of relief in that.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles nods. \u201cWhat you said to Scott, about losing people . . . is that how you feel about it?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cObviously,\u201d Peter says, and Stiles gives him a look. \u201cI don\u2019t regret killing her. But I\u2019ll always have questions about what could have happened, if I had figured out what she was up to, if I had been able to stop her. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s too strange.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI wish I could fix it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI know. But some things can\u2019t be fixed, Stiles. You just have to wait for them to heal over time.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles sighs and nods. \u201cOkay.\u201d He leans in for a kiss. \u201cHey. Can I tell you something?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou frequently do.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI love you.\u201d Stiles swallows hard. \u201cOkay?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d Peter says, with a slight smile. \u201cThat is very okay.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles relaxes a little. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to say it back, if you\u2019re not ready. I get that it\u2019s hard for you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOn the contrary,\u201d Peter says, \u201cloving you is the easiest thing I\u2019ve ever done. I\u2019ve loved you from the day you broke into my apartment, made fun of me for my cat\u2019s name, and ordered me to tell you that Han Solo shot first.\u201d He leans in and kisses Stiles on the forehead. \u201cYou didn\u2019t even ask my opinion before you made yourself a place in my life. You\u2019re the first person in years who wanted to be a part of that, who wanted to know me. That was all I really wanted, you know. Somebody to know me.\u201d He drops another kiss on Stiles\u2019 forehead, then continues, \u201cNow, that is the sappiest thing I\u2019ve ever said in my life, so if you tell anyone about it . . .\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019ll tear my throat out with your teeth?\u201d Stiles says.</p>\n<p>Peter arches his eyebrows at Stiles and says, \u201cI\u2019ll make you wait until your <em>nineteenth</em> birthday.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles falls back onto the pillows, groaning melodramatically. Peter just laughs, looking far more smug than he has any right to be.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>~ ~ ~ ~</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>A few days later, Derek calls Stiles and says, \u201cI talked to Cora. Told her about what happened, about Peter and Laura. She\u2019s on her way up from Argentina.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCool,\u201d Stiles says.</p>\n<p>Derek audibly scowls and says, \u201cShe\u2019s gonna want to see Peter, so just tell us when a good time to show up is.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles is somewhat annoyed at being asked to play Western Union, and contemplates telling Derek to just call his uncle and ask him himself. But he knows that things aren\u2019t that easy for any of the Hales, so he can be a messenger for now. \u201cOkay, well, will Cora be here by Saturday?\u201d he asks, and Derek says she will be. \u201cI\u2019ll talk to Peter about having my dad over for dinner that night. You like lasagna, yes?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes . . .\u201d Derek says, seeming a bit wary. \u201cHow did you know?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBecause Peter told me, obviously,\u201d Stiles says, rolling his eyes. \u201cI\u2019ll tell him to make lasagna because my Dad likes it, which isn\u2019t even a lie. Come over around five thirty and we\u2019ll eat at six.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Derek says, and hangs up without another word.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s easy enough to set it up with all the involved parties, and a few days later, Stiles is chopping tomatoes for the salad when there\u2019s a knock on the door. Since he\u2019s told Peter that his father is coming, Peter doesn\u2019t seem concerned, so Stiles jogs over to open it. He\u2019s pleased to see that Cora made it, although both she and Derek have identical scowls on their faces. He bites back a smile and lets them in.</p>\n<p>Peter comes out of the kitchen, having heard the dual heartbeats and possibly recognized their scents, and now he\u2019s frowning, too. \u201cWhat are you \u2013 oh, hello, Cora. What are you two doing here?\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek folds his arms over his chest. \u201cStiles said you were making lasagna.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d Peter says, somewhat warily.</p>\n<p>Derek\u2019s glower bores into Peter\u2019s skull. \u201cI like lasagna.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter studies him for a long moment, then says, \u201cWell, all right, then. I\u2019ll make an extra loaf of garlic bread.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles grins and heads back into the kitchen to continue working on the salad. Cora says that they went to the grocery store and brought brownies for dessert. Noah arrives a few minutes later with a gallon of iced tea, a bottle of wine, and a six-pack of beer. The garlic bread smells so good that Stiles wants to rub his face in it.</p>\n<p>It would be easy for things to get awkward, but Stiles has prepared for that. Every time the conversation seems like it\u2019s in danger of lapsing, he jumps in with a question about Peter\u2019s cooking, or what Cora\u2019s been up to, or whether or not anyone besides him is about ready to give up on The Walking Dead.</p>\n<p>After they\u2019ve eaten, Derek clears the table and Cora scowls her way through rinsing the dishes and putting them in the dishwasher. Peter half-heartedly protests but doesn\u2019t really try to stop them. He\u2019s indulging in his third glass of the wine, and Stiles is teasing him about how werewolves can\u2019t get drunk so does he actually like the taste?</p>\n<p>\u201cWe, uh, we brought a movie,\u201d Derek says, fishing in his bag and taking out a DVD of <em>Galaxy Quest</em>.</p>\n<p>Peter\u2019s eyes go a little wide. \u201cI love that movie.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI know.\u201d A smile sneaks onto Derek\u2019s face. \u201cI remember when we were kids, when something wasn\u2019t going your way, you would stop and declare \u2018this episode was badly written!\u2019 I didn\u2019t realize it was a reference but always thought it was funny. Then later . . . in New York City, Laura and I caught it on TV and I realized you\u2019d been quoting it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles snickers. \u201cYou\u2019re such a drama queen, Peter.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter flips him off, and Derek and Cora both laugh. Then Derek says, \u201cWe, uh . . . I hated leaving you behind. I just want you to know that. I told Laura that we shouldn\u2019t have, that it wasn\u2019t right. Laura said . . .\u201d Derek has to stop briefly to maintain his composure. \u201cThat you would have wanted us to prioritize our safety over yours. That we had to protect ourselves, even if it meant leaving you behind.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, she was right, in some ways,\u201d Peter says. \u201cLeaving me behind wasn\u2019t necessary to your safety . . . but if it had been, I would have wanted you to do it. You couldn\u2019t have known differently.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah. I know. I just wanted you to know that I always wished we hadn\u2019t.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter nods. \u201cThank you, nephew.\u201d</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a brief moment of silence, and Stiles jumps in with, \u201cSo, the movie? I don\u2019t think my dad\u2019s seen it, you are in for such a treat even though half the jokes in it will probably go right over your head since you\u2019re not a Star Trek fan . . .\u201d</p>\n<p>They head into the living room. Cora puts the movie on. Peter sits down on the sofa and Stiles sprawls out over his lap. T\u2019Challa, who has been hiding from the company, ventures out and hops up onto the back of the sofa where he can sit right behind Peter. Stiles rests his head in the crook of Peter\u2019s neck, enjoys the feeling of Peter absently rubbing a hand up and down his spine. He\u2019s asleep before the first scene ends.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>~ ~ ~ ~</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Stiles wakes up after about an hour, when a burst of laughter ripples through the audience. He yawns and repositions himself so he can see better.</p>\n<p>Parting at the end of the movie is a little awkward. Peter clearly wants to know if they intend on making this a regular thing, but can't figure out how to ask. Derek is so socially dense that Peter's hints are going right over his head. After the first three attempts fail, Stiles gives up and takes pity on them. \u201cSo what should Peter cook next time?\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek scowls and says, \u201cCora should pick. She's been eating beetles in the jungle.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cReally?\u201d Stiles asks.</p>\n<p>Cora gives him a withering look. Then she deliberately ignores the question and says to Peter, \u201cThat slow-cooker chili you used to make?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAn excellent choice,\u201d Peter says. \u201cNext Saturday?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSure. And I'll bring Scattergories,\u201d Derek says.</p>\n<p>Peter gives a snort. \u201cIf you really want to embarrass yourself, by all means.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek glowers at him and says, \u201cI'm not fifteen anymore and I've spent the last six years with my nose in books. We'll see who ends up embarrassed.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles snickers as the Hale siblings depart. His father leaves after that, giving him a hug and saying, \u201cYou be good.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat are the odds?\u201d Stiles asks with a grin, and Noah rolls his eyes and leaves.</p>\n<p>\u201cOne brownie left,\u201d Peter says, examining what's left in the kitchen. \u201cWant to split it?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSure,\u201d Stiles says.</p>\n<p>Peter cuts it diagonally and hands stiles his piece on a napkin. \u201cSo, I assume you masterminded this?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, it took a real mastermind to figure out you'd like to have a nice family dinner,\u201d Stiles says. Peter gives him a look. \u201cYes, I put this together. But again. Not a mastermind.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNot for that reason, at least,\u201d Peter says. He leans over and gives Stiles a soft kiss on the cheek. Stiles returns it, then turns his head for a real kiss. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou're welcome. You know, you could have just asked them.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut I wouldn't have,\u201d Peter says, and Stiles sighs. \u201cDon\u2019t make that face like you\u2019re perfectly well-adjusted about everything and I\u2019m the strange one in this relationship. I\u2019ll remind you that on our first date, I drugged your tea and tricked you into thinking I was gluing your soul back together.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles laughs despite himself. \u201cThat\u2019s what you consider a date? Wow.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat would you call it?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, but definitely not a date.\u201d Stiles flops back onto the sofa. \u201cAt least you didn\u2019t count our first date as the time you abducted me, forced me to help you murder someone, and then I set you on fire.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPlus I proposed in the middle,\u201d Peter points out. \u201cMustn\u2019t forget that bit of romance.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles laughs even harder. When he\u2019s calmed down a little, he says, \u201cYou know, I was thinking about that. Because I don\u2019t really want to be a werewolf. I like being human. But I do want to be your mate. So I\u2019m gonna figure out a way to do it. You know, since I\u2019m a spark and all that jazz. I\u2019m going to find out how to duplicate that sort of bond without the Bite.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you, now?\u201d Peter says, seeming amused.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes. Yes, I am.\u201d Stiles looks over as Peter sits down on the sofa next to him, and moves so he can sprawl across Peter\u2019s lap. \u201cI think things are gonna be okay. You know? I wouldn\u2019t have believed it a few months ago. But I think they are. I think <em>we\u2019re</em> gonna be okay.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter arches an eyebrow and says, \u201cI\u2019ll defer to your superior judgment on the matter.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDamn right you will,\u201d Stiles says. He shakes his head a little and says, \u201cNo, it\u2019s more than that. It\u2019s not just that we\u2019re going to be okay. We\u2019re going to be okay <em>together</em>. We\u2019re going to be a <em>pack</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter\u2019s throat works a little as he swallows. \u201cI\u2019m not sure you know what those words mean to me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI do,\u201d Stiles says, reaching up to trace his fingers along Peter\u2019s cheekbone, where the burn scars had once been. \u201cThat\u2019s why I said them.\u201d</p>\n<p>After a moment, Peter nods. He reaches up and takes Stiles\u2019 hand, presses a kiss on the inside of his wrist, a kiss that feels like a promise.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>~fin~</p>"
