  "text": "<p>Harry flopped back onto the bed, staring up at the ceiling. Unlike at Hogwarts, the signs of magic in the rooms above the Leaky Cauldron were more subtle. There was more light in the bedroom than the scattered candles suggested, and Harry was sure he'd heard muttering from the mirror when he'd walked in. As unsettling as that had been, though, he felt the night had been a success.</p>\n<p>He wasn't going to be expelled for blowing up Aunt Marge. (He'd been pardoned by the Minister himself!) Now he had almost a whole month away from the Dursleys before he started back at Hogwarts. The Minister had seemed sure that Harry would be safe at the Cauldron, and Harry was just grateful to be away from Privet Drive.</p>\n<p>He could only imagine what his punishment would have been if he'd stuck around, and he was glad he wouldn't have to find out just yet. Hopefully everyone would forget the whole incident by next summer. (Unlikely, but Harry refused to let anything dampen his mood.)</p>\n<p>Hedwig hooted from her corner, and Harry tilted his head upside down to look at her. It felt silly and free. It was nice not to need to hush her in fear of Uncle Vernon overhearing and trying to throw her out again. \"What is it, girl? Did you not get enough to eat?\"</p>\n<p>Then, there was a sharp rap on his door.</p>\n<p>Cautiously, Harry stood up and walked over to it. Had the Minister changed his mind? Who else could already know Harry was there? Harry had been checked in under a fake name, and no one had seen him arrive except Tom. The Minister's words of caution on his mind, Harry called, \"Er, hello?\"</p>\n<p>There was a sigh from the other side. \"Open the door, Potter.\"</p>\n<p>Harry's blood went cold. He'd know that voice anywhere. Hoping he was wrong, Harry unlocked and opened the door. An imposing figure in black robes towered in the door frame, arms folded.</p>\n<p>\"Professor Snape,\" Harry greeted, dismayed.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">#</p>\n<p>Severus was not having a good evening.</p>\n<p>He was supposed to be at home working on his new alterations of Pepper-Up Potion, but a Patronus message from Dumbledore had torn him from his work and sent him on a mission into London. The information from Dumbledore had been short, to the point, and left no room for argument. The last point was the most frustrating, because Severus was already compiling a <em>long</em> list of reasons why this was Dumbledore\u2019s most absurd request of him yet.</p>\n<p>Though Severus hadn\u2019t actually prepared a list in advance of the ways he would least like to spend his summer holidays, being sent to London to collect a runaway Potter would certainly have been near the bottom.</p>\n<p>The boy in question looked no more excited to see his professor there. Despite the urgency of Dumbledore\u2019s message, he seemed unharmed. He was wearing faded, oversized clothing\u2014probably some unfortunate Muggle fashion trend\u2014and his green eyes were wide behind his glasses.</p>\n<p>Severus looked away from those eyes and strode into the room. \u201cGood,\u201d he said, spotting the trunk at the foot of the bed. \u201cYou didn\u2019t unpack.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\" Potter asked. He hovered between the door and the rest of the room as though he was considering making his second escape attempt of the evening.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou couldn\u2019t really expect that Dumbledore would allow you to stay unattended at a brewpub in the middle of London for the rest of summer,\u201d Severus said, exasperated.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe Minister said I could\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe Minister is a bumbling idiot who is just glad that you didn\u2019t end up a bloody corpse for him to do PR to cover up,\u201d Severus interrupted. \u201cHe has no authority over you, and should not have pretended to. Then again, if he hadn\u2019t, who knows where you might have ended up. Honestly, running away from home, Potter? Isn\u2019t that a level of juvenility beyond even your standards?\u201d</p>\n<p>Potter crossed his arms. \u201cI\u2019m not going back,\u201d he said.</p>\n<p>\u201cUnfortunately for you, Dumbledore agrees. It seems he can no longer trust you to remain put, and has decided on an alternate\u2014and far more distasteful\u2014solution for your accommodations for the rest of the summer.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCan\u2019t be much more distasteful than staying with the Dursleys,\u201d Potter muttered.</p>\n<p>Severus raised an eyebrow. \u201cYou\u2019re so sure?\u201d</p>\n<p>Finally, the boy hesitated. \u201cWhy? Where do I have to go?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt seems you caught Dumbledore in a strange mood this evening,\u201d Severus said. \u201cYou\u2019re staying with me.\u201d</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a moment of silence. \u201cWith you?\u201d Potter croaked. He cleared his throat. \u201cAt Hogwarts?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou don\u2019t actually believe professors live at the castle during the summer holidays,\u201d Severus said, but not very hopefully. The boy is just daft enough that he might. \u201cI have a residence in Cokeworth. We\u2019ll be staying there until I return to prepare for classes two days before the semester begins. That gives us slightly less than three weeks to drive each other to madness.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou can\u2019t be serious,\u201d Potter said.</p>\n<p>\u201cWould that I were kidding,\u201d Severus said.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe Weasleys would let me stay with them,\u201d Potter said.</p>\n<p>\u201cIf they were not in Egypt. You know as well as I do that they\u2019re not available,\u201d Severus said. \u201cBelieve me, I spent the entire journey here desperate to think of an alternative. But I do as Dumbledore says, and so shall you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHow do I know Dumbledore really sent you?\u201d</p>\n<p>Severus snorted. \u201cYou truly believe that this is an honor I would volunteer for if I weren\u2019t being coerced?\u201d</p>\n<p>There was an obstinate tilt to the boy\u2019s jaw. \u201cDo you have any proof? Can I talk to him?\u201d</p>\n<p>He shook his head. \u201cIf Dumbledore had the time to deal with you himself, he\u2019d be the one here in the middle of the night.\u201d When the boy didn\u2019t budge, he said, \u201cFine. How\u2019s this?\u201d</p>\n<p>He cast a quick spell to recreate the phoenix Patronus he\u2019d received earlier that night. The silvery bird was smaller than the original, hovering just at the tip of his wand. \u201cSeverus, I need you to away to London,\u201d it began. He let it speak just long enough for Potter to hear the headmaster\u2019s voice before he waved it away again.</p>\n<p>\u201cNow, there\u2019s no time to waste. It\u2019s late, and I have no desire to argue with you all night,\u201d Severus said. \u201cWe\u2019ll take the Floo to a neutral destination near my village, and then Apparate the rest of the way.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNow?\u201d Potter asked.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s nearly two in the morning. When else were you thinking?\u201d</p>\n<p>Potter cast a longing look at the bed, but then steeled himself with surprising grace. \u201cOkay,\u201d he said. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"center\">#</p>\n<p>By the time they arrived at Snape\u2019s house, Harry was barely able to keep his eyes open. The various adventures of the night had worn him out, and the extra precautions they\u2019d taken to get to Snape\u2019s house had sapped the last of his energy. He\u2019d fallen asleep as soon as he\u2019d been in front of a bed, without taking the time to look around. He remembered, vaguely, Snape muttering something derogatory, but Harry hadn\u2019t had the mental energy to decipher it.</p>\n<p>When he woke up, Harry jolted awake and looked around. He immediately remembered the events of the night before, and lashed himself mentally for falling asleep at all. Though his heart was pounding, his surroundings seemed\u2026normal. \u00a0</p>\n<p>He was in a small, neutral bedroom. It was a bit dusty, and was decorated in boring grays. The door was closed, and he seemed to be alone. There was a quiet rustle of feathers from across the room, and he amended that. Mostly alone, apart from a sleeping Hedwig.</p>\n<p>Cautiously, Harry stood up and looked around. There was, thankfully, a small attached bathroom, which he used quickly. His trunk was sitting at the foot of his bed. He hadn\u2019t bothered to change out of the clothes he\u2019d run away in before falling asleep, but he felt wrinkled and gross, so he swapped clothes now. He dressed quickly, half-expecting Snape to burst through the door, but everything stayed quiet.</p>\n<p>After making sure all of his belongings were in place, Harry pocketed his wand and went to the door. He was so sure that he would find it locked that he jumped when the knob turned under his hand.</p>\n<p>Despite Harry\u2019s expectations, the house beyond his bedroom didn\u2019t appear to be a haunted mansion. Like the bedroom, it had the bland, slightly dusty appearance of Aunt Marge\u2019s guest rooms, though without the photos of her dogs. He wondered if Snape had brought them to a safe home of some sort. He had trouble believing that this was the house Snape lived in full-time.</p>\n<p>According to the clock, it was nearly eleven in the morning. Harry started, immediately on edge. How had he slept so long? Aunt Petunia would have locked him back in his old cupboard with no lunch if he slept through his morning chores. There was no chance Snape was any different. Was Snape going to be sitting somewhere, watching the clock and waiting for him? What would he expect Harry to do around the house to pay for his room and board? They both knew this situation wasn\u2019t part of the kindness of his heart.</p>\n<p>\u201cThere you are,\u201d Snape said.</p>\n<p>Harry jumped and turned. Snape was standing in a small kitchen, his wand pointing at a kettle on the stove. Harry looked at the wand cautiously, but it didn\u2019t so much as twitch as Harry edged into the room.</p>\n<p>\u201cI wondered if you\u2019d ever wake up.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Harry said.</p>\n<p>Snape just raised an eyebrow. \u201cThis is what happens when one runs away from home and traipses through London all night. I\u2019d have slept longer myself, only I\u2019m not a twelve-year-old with no responsibilities.\u201d \u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m thirteen,\u201d Harry said quietly.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, of course,\u201d Snape sneered. \u201cForgive me for not having your birthday marked on my calendar. I expect you had a big enough celebration with all of your adoring fans to make up for my oversight. Sit down.\u201d</p>\n<p>When Harry sat, Snape hovered a plate and a cup of tea in front of him. Harry looked down at the toast and eggs (slightly overcooked, but palatable), and then frowned up at Snape, who was still standing by the counter. \u201cWhat\u2026?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cApologies if it\u2019s not up to your high standards,\u201d Snape said.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou made me breakfast?\u201d Harry asked.</p>\n<p>\u201cI imagine that Dumbledore would take issue if I let you starve in my care,\u201d Snape said.</p>\n<p>Harry blinked. \u201cI know how to cook,\u201d he said. Mrs. Weasley had never made Harry cook, but she liked to cook. She liked <em>Harry</em>. Why would Snape not leave Harry to fend for himself\u2014or cook for them both?</p>\n<p>Snape rolled his eyes. \u201cYou think I\u2019d let you interact fire in my kitchen? You forget, I\u2019ve been grading your Potions work for two years. We\u2019d be lucky if you weren\u2019t poisoned. You know eggs can contain bacteria if undercooked.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve cooked every breakfast for the Dursleys every day I\u2019ve been home for years,\u201d Harry argued, feeling defensive.</p>\n<p>Snape just gave him a skeptical glance and then nodded to the plate again. \u201cEat. I\u2019ll be in my lab. Just because it\u2019s summer doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t have work to do.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2026\u201d Harry trailed off. \u201cDo you not need breakfast?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI already ate, obviously. Tomorrow, if you don\u2019t sleep so late, you may even witness the event.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cRight,\u201d Harry said. \u201cShould\u2026\u201d He stopped again. Would Snape give him his list of chores now, or just expect Harry to figure things out? He didn\u2019t seem interested in talking more.</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t touch anything outside of your room. I\u2019ll know if you have. Bother me if you must, but only if you must.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, sir,\u201d Harry said. He waited until Snape left before he began to eat.</p>\n<p>This was\u2026weird. Harry didn\u2019t know what he\u2019d expected, but everything felt off. He was used to being ignored. The days when the Dursleys had refused to speak to him were always the most pleasant. But there was no pattern yet here, no set of rules laid out for Harry to follow. That meant, he had learned, that he\u2019d find the rules when he broke them.</p>\n<p>He couldn\u2019t get detention. This wasn\u2019t school. What was Snape\u2019s idea of a punishment for Harry breaking a rule in his house? Harry already felt as though he was on eggshells, and he\u2019d been awake in the house for less than an hour.</p>\n<p>For a moment, he was furious with Dumbledore for sending him here. Harry would have been better off alone in Diagon Alley. Dumbledore knew Snape hated Harry, and that the professor would set Harry up to fail. Was this punishment for running away? Why not just say so, instead of pretending it was for Harry\u2019s safety?</p>\n<p>When Harry finished eating, he washed his plate, the pan, and the kettle Snape had used, but the rest of the kitchen was clean. Should he dust? There was a layer on most of the cabinet shelves. Would Snape be angrier at Harry for leaving something dirty, or for touching his things?</p>\n<p>Finally, Harry retreated to his room without attempting to clean anything else. Snape had only given him the one instruction, and Harry wasn\u2019t going to step into a trap by breaking it already.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">#</p>\n<p>Severus wished he had a more taxing potion to work on. Pepper-Up was a relatively standard mix, and his alterations were all logical changes based on his understand of alchemical interactions. That left his mind free to think about his unwelcome house guest.</p>\n<p>Severus had cast a charm on Potter\u2019s door to alert him when it opened. Though part of him had expected the boy to make another escape attempt during the night, the alarm didn\u2019t sound until well into the next morning.</p>\n<p>Throughout breakfast, the boy had been silent. Then, afterward, he had returned to his bedroom again without arguing. Severus had expected more nosiness from Gryffindor\u2019s biggest troublemaker, or at least some demands to go outside.</p>\n<p>Potter was acting strange. Plotting something, most likely. Severus was starting to lose his mind waiting for the other shoe to drop. Why had Dumbledore done this to them? They\u2019d be lucky to get to the end of summer alive at this rate. Severus was one aborted sentence away from shouting.</p>\n<p>What was the boy doing in the guest room? If Severus hadn\u2019t trusted his own warding so thoroughly, he might have thought Potter had managed to slip away.</p>\n<p>Finally, after another few hours of silence, Severus was able to focus thoroughly on his work. By the time he left his lab that evening, he could almost pretend that he was alone in the house.</p>\n<p>Glancing at the clock, Severus frowned. It was later than he\u2019d expected, far later than they usually served dinner at Hogwarts. Had the boy ignored his instructions and cooked something? Maybe he\u2019d eaten one of the few snacks Severus kept around the house that didn\u2019t need preparation for both lunch and dinner. That hadn\u2019t been Severus\u2019s plan, but it would have been the easy answer for the boy in an unfamiliar setting. Surely the famous Harry Potter wouldn\u2019t feel an issue with grabbing what food he saw. Severus would need to go the store tomorrow to make sure he had enough supplies to feed them both.</p>\n<p>However, when Severus checked his wards, they confirmed that Potter hadn\u2019t left his room since he\u2019d finished breakfast.</p>\n<p>Potter must have brought food in his trunk. Severus should have predicted that. Teenage boys could eat their body weight in one sitting. Half of that trunk was probably full of sweets.</p>\n<p>Scowling, he knocked on Potter\u2019s door. \u201cPotter,\u201d he barked.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Potter called back.</p>\n<p>Did no one ever teach the boy manners? Any one of Severus\u2019s Slytherins would have at least added a \u2018sir\u2019 to that. \u201cDinner,\u201d he said, and went into the kitchen.</p>\n<p>By the time Potter slipped into the room, Severus was almost finished heating the leftover soup he\u2019d frozen the week before. Thank Merlin Severus had made enough to save. He\u2019d have hated to end the day cooking after spending so long over his cauldron.</p>\n<p>Severus plated two bowls and put one in front of Potter. Reluctantly, he sat across from the boy. To mitigate the awkwardness, he summoned the morning\u2019s Daily Prophet from the living room to skim while he ate.</p>\n<p>There was a long period of silence. Finally, unable to take any more, Severus snapped the newspaper closed and said, \u201cI\u2019d prefer if you didn\u2019t eat in the bedroom. Crumbs attract pests, even in magical houses.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cRight,\u201d Potter said, seeming confused.</p>\n<p>\u201cGood,\u201d he said.</p>\n<p>And that was the conversation for the night.</p>\n<p align=\"center\"><br>\n#</p>\n<p>The next morning after another awkward breakfast, Harry couldn\u2019t hold back the question anymore. \u201cSn\u2014Sir,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat am I meant to be <em>doing</em> here?\u201d He had spent the entire day yesterday in his room, rereading his letters and doing coursework. It had been a novelty to be able to read his magic textbooks without needing to sneak them from the cupboard, and it had been almost nice to have a room to himself without the threat of Dudley barging in. Still, Harry felt like he was missing something. Snape was letting Harry stay, and there was no chance that he wanted Harry to have the time as a vacation. Harry had been strictly forbidden from touching anything, but surely Snape had something in mind.</p>\n<p>\u201cMore than twenty-four hours, and you still haven\u2019t figured that out?\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry winced. Clearly Snape thought the answer was obvious. \u201cI\u2019m not used to wizard houses. All of the chores already seem to be done. I don\u2019t know what you want me to do.\u201d</p>\n<p>Snape narrowed his eyes. \u201cHilarious,\u201d he drawled. \u201cAre you really not able to entertain yourself? What do you do all day at home?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell,\u201d Harry prevaricated. Did Snape want the list? Would he use it as fuel to mock Harry with later, or was he looking for ideas on what he should be making Harry do for the next few weeks.</p>\n<p>\u201cHave you finished all of your homework?\u201d Snape prodded.</p>\n<p>\u201cAlmost,\u201d Harry said.</p>\n<p>\u201cSchool begins again in three weeks. You should have completed everything last month,\u201d Snape pointed out.</p>\n<p>\u201cI didn\u2019t have much time to work on things with the Dursleys,\u201d Harry said. With all of the chores he did during the day, it had been hard to stay up and complete his readings and essays by wandlight every night without exhausting himself. \u201cI just have one more essay to finish.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhich one?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s on the properties of Banishment,\u201d Harry said. \u201cI just have a bit more research to do.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI can only imagine. All right. You\u2019ll bring your homework for me to assess this evening,\u201d Snape said.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2026 What?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe thought of shoddy work being done under my roof is going to give me hives,\u201d Snape said. \u201cIf you\u2019re so bored, I\u2019ll edit what you\u2019ve done so far and give you ways to rewrite. Besides, if anyone finds out that you were in my custody this summer and still turned in your usual caliber of work, I\u2019ll never live down the shame.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to do that,\u201d Harry said quickly. He\u2019d thought the one perk of spending the summer with Snape was that he wouldn\u2019t have to worry about the teacher hounding him on his academic performance. The idea of Snape looking through his work and shredding him every day was terrifying.</p>\n<p>\u201cTonight,\u201d Snape repeated, and then turned back to his newspaper.</p>\n<p>He cleared his throat. Snape glanced up, clearly annoyed that the conversation was continuing. Harry pressed forward. \u201cI saw through the window that you have a garden,\u201d he said.</p>\n<p>\u201cAll true Potions Masters do.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s a bit overgrown.\u201d</p>\n<p>Snape\u2019s nostrils flared. \u201cIs that so? It\u2019s almost as though I have to work far away in a frozen castle nine months of the year.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not trying to\u2026\u201d Harry took a deep breath. \u201cI just thought I could help.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHelp?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhen I\u2019m not working on my essays,\u201d Harry said. \u201cI garden back home, and I\u2019m good at it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou garden?\u201d Snape didn\u2019t seem to know which word to emphasize more, so the sentence came out as an incredulous drawl. \u201cI don\u2019t recall hearing of any spectacular Herbology scores from you. I suppose it could have gotten lost in the exuberant praise you constantly acquire, but I recall a story about Miss Granger being the one to break Pamona\u2019s Devil\u2019s Snare trap. I always assumed that without her, you would have simply perished.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNot magical plants,\u201d Harry explained. \u201cJust regular ones. I\u2019ll be helpful, I swear.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll never understand the youth\u2019s attachment to the outdoors,\u201d Snape said. \u201cFine. But be careful. Some of those ingredients are worth more than your hide.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cStart with the vegetable patch. Surely there\u2019s nothing you can screw up there. Supplies are in the shed. I\u2019ll be in the lab. Try not to injure yourself.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, sir,\u201d Harry said.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">#</p>\n<p>Harry realized immediately when he got outside that he had underestimated Snape\u2019s garden. There was a greenhouse behind the house which had the more magical plants Snape had warned him to stay away from, but even the Muggle version of the garden along the east edge of the house was larger than any on Privet Drive. In addition to being more functional than decorative, like the plots Harry was used to, the garden had also been neglected for what looked like months. Weeds interlaced the vegetables and flowers with abandon, creating a tangled mess against the soil. Though there were some ripe tomatoes on the vine, most of the plants had already lost their fruit in the summer heat.</p>\n<p>Snape had warned him that there were wards in a hundred meter bubble around the main house, and that he shouldn\u2019t bypass that distance unless he wanted to set off an alarm and experience a mild shock. Harry, cautious of Snape minimizing the severity of the shock for the humor of seeing Harry stumble into it, made careful note of the wards so he wouldn\u2019t accidentally step through.</p>\n<p>Harry pulled on a pair of gloves he\u2019d found in the shed, and jumped when they automatically shrunk to fit his hands. He flexed his fingers. They fit perfectly.</p>\n<p>Though it was a hot day, there was something pleasant about spending time outside again. After a full day cooped in Snape\u2019s guest bedroom, trying to breathe quietly and not disturb his host, it was freeing to use his muscles and get dirty.</p>\n<p>For years, he\u2019d hated working on Aunt Petunia\u2019s flower beds. Her standards were unrealistic, inflated by the lawns she saw on the telly, and she resented any breaks Harry took to get water or eat. Once, when he was younger, he\u2019d fallen asleep on a bed of freshly-planted tulips after Dudley had kept him up all night by stomping above his cupboard. The fragile stems had been crushed under his body, and Petunia had taken away his dinner privileges for a week.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Over time, though, he\u2019d learned to appreciate the solitude. It was an excuse as good as any to avoid the Dursleys, and since none of them had any frame of reference for how long gardening should take, he\u2019d been able to steal time for himself.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Around midday, Harry popped back into his room for a glass of water from his sink, and took an hour to unpack. Then, he went back into the afternoon sun to continue working on the garden.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The sky grew dark around him, but Harry got absorbed clearing one particularly stubborn patch of yarrow weeds that had taken over an entire corner of the plot. The roots had been tangled deep into the soil, and he\u2019d needed to chop at them so hard that there were creases from the hand shovel etched in his palms.</p>\n<p>He didn\u2019t realize how late it had gotten until he glanced over and saw a pair of black boots on the grass beside him. With a startled jolt, Harry looked up\u2014and up\u2014at Snape.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>What</em>,\u201d Snape said coldly, \u201cdid you do?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2026\u201d Harry said, gesturing vaguely at the plot. \u201cGardening?\u201d What had offended Snape so much? He had been sure not to track in any dirt when he\u2019d gone in during the day, and the garden was already looking much better than it had that morning.</p>\n<p>Snape pointed to the pile of extracted yallow. \u201cAnd what is that?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWeeds?\u201d</p>\n<p>With a heavy sigh, Snape said, \u201cI should have known better than to trust you with this. If you hadn\u2019t already proven your ineptitude over the last two years, I could have just thought back to your father and realized that this would inevitably be too much for you to manage.\u201d</p>\n<p>Scrambling to his feet, embarrassed and aware of the dirt on his clothes, Harry said, \u201cI did what I said I was going to! You can\u2019t pretend now that you didn\u2019t tell me I could.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI said you could help clean things up, not tear out an entire patch of the main ingredient of homebrewed Skele-Gro,\u201d Snape said. \u201cThose were on the verge of blooming.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry glanced back down at the weeds he\u2019d just pulled up. \u201cYarrow is a Potions ingredient?\u201d he guessed.</p>\n<p>Snape folded his arms. \u201cYes, Potter. And if you\u2019d ever picked up a book, you\u2019d know that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI have\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI was planning on bringing some of my plants back to Hogwarts to cut the cost of bringing in Skele-Gro from St. Mungo\u2019s stores, but clearly that will have to wait until next year.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe could try to\u2026\u201d Harry trailed off. Magic could fix most things, but he had torn the roots of the weeds beyond repair. \u201cI\u2026\u201d Did Snape know that Muggles saw yarrow as a weed? Would he even care about Harry\u2019s arguments? Harry couldn\u2019t figure out if this had been a set-up, or if Harry had managed to screw up the one thing Snape had actually trusted him to do. Which was worse? Being set up to fail, or confirming Snape\u2019s terrible opinion of him only two days into their three week cohabitation?</p>\n<p>\u201cAre there any sentences you\u2019re planning on finishing, or are you going to continue hacking the English language as thoroughly as you did those plants?\u201d</p>\n<p>With a shaky sigh, Harry shook his head.</p>\n<p>\u201cThank Merlin I didn\u2019t let you into the greenhouse,\u201d Snape muttered.</p>\n<p>He pointed his wand at Harry, who flinched back. He\u2019d left his own wand in his bedroom. There wasn\u2019t much he could do to fight against a wizard like Snape anyway, but he wished he had something to defend himself with beyond a hand shovel. Instead of hexing him, though, the spell Snape cast created a quick breeze over Harry\u2019s form. Looking down, Harry saw that his clothes had been scrubbed completely clean.</p>\n<p>At Snape\u2019s imperious gesture, Harry followed Snape back into the house. When Snape split off toward the kitchen, Harry trudged toward his bedroom. \u201cWhere are you going?\u201d Snape asked. \u201cWhy do you think I came out to collect you? Dinner is ready.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry hesitated, waiting for the punchline. \u201cBut\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI messed up your garden,\u201d Harry blurted.</p>\n<p>\u201cPotter, you\u2019ve been working outside all day. If you ate lunch, it was surely whatever sweet treats you still have hidden away, since I\u2019m not missing any other food. I can\u2019t send you to bed without a real meal.\u201d Harry didn\u2019t answer. Snape huffed and rolled his eyes. \u201cYou may be looking for an excuse to report to Dumbledore what a cruel monster I was to you, but I won\u2019t stand for it. Sit down and eat.\u201d</p>\n<p>Reeling, Harry sat.</p>\n<p>Throughout the meal, he was on edge, waiting for Snape to yell again, or to laugh and take back the meal. But nothing happened. Snape levitated a scroll to spin slowly in front of him as he ate, letting him completely ignore Harry. Harry finished his bowl of stew, and found the bowl immediately refilled. He hesitated for a moment, not sure if it had been an automatic magical reaction or something Snape had done, but he ate the second helping anyway.</p>\n<p>When Harry stood to move his bowl to the sink, Snape said, \u201cBring your homework to the living room in an hour.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry winced. There was the punishment. He nodded and went to the sink. Just as he started to rinse it, the bowl was plucked magically out of his hand, scrubbed thoroughly, and set gleaming in a drying rack before Harry could even jump. He glanced back at Snape to see if he had done the spell, but his professor was still ignoring him.</p>\n<p>Full but confused, still dreading what the evening would bring, Harry finally escaped back to his room.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">#</p>\n<p>If Severus hadn\u2019t been paying attention, he wouldn\u2019t have noticed when Potter entered the living room. For a Gryffindor notorious for rushing into danger, the boy could move quietly when he wanted. Perhaps he was worried about retaliation for his mistake in the garden earlier. Good\u2014Severus wanted to keep him on edge. If Potter got too relaxed, Merlin only knew what mischief he would decide to cause.</p>\n<p>Once Potter had left the kitchen, Severus had gone back outside to assess the rest of the damage, and had been surprised to find that\u2014other than the yarrow incident\u2014an extremely well-manicured garden plot. Potter had done more work than Severus had expected, and had taken obvious care to retain the integrity of the plants he had known.</p>\n<p>Severus hadn\u2019t used the garden recently, which was one of the reasons he\u2019d felt comfortable turning the boy loose on it. However, Potter had done a good enough job that Severus was tempted to restart his gardening efforts to match the plot he now had on hand. With the three weeks he had left before the semester started, and a touch of magic, he\u2019d be able to turn over a decent amount of blooms and produce from the plot.</p>\n<p>Where had the boy been hiding his methodical talents for the past two years? If he was half as diligent chopping ingredients as he\u2019d been extracting weeds, his potions might not have ended up as such clumpy disasters.</p>\n<p>Potter had a stack of books in his hands, along with a series of rolled parchments precariously perched on top. As he approached, the stack wobbled, but he managed to set them on the coffee table without incident. From his armchair, Severus held out his hand. \u201cAn essay, if you don\u2019t mind.\u201d On the table, he had a quill already sharpened.</p>\n<p>Potter hesitated, hands hovering over the scrolls, before he finally selected one and handed it over. Severus glanced at the scratchy heading. It was for McGonagall\u2019s course, though he should have guessed from the heft of the parchment. It was good to see that Minerva wasn\u2019t skimping in her assignments of summer work.</p>\n<p>\u201cNot Potions?\u201d Severus asked, hiding a smirk.</p>\n<p>Potter puffed up slightly. \u201cI thought it would be cheating for you to look over your own assignment,\u201d he said.</p>\n<p>Severus hummed thoughtfully. He was mostly sure that Potter was just looking to avoid having Severus look over his shoddy workmanship on his own subject, but he let it slide. Without another word, Severus unscrolled the parchment and began reading.</p>\n<p>Potter, after a few moments of fidgeting, settled down with an open Charms textbook to take notes for his final essay.</p>\n<p>After only a few minutes, though, Severus put down the scroll. \u201cMerlin, Potter, your handwriting has gotten more atrocious than ever. Did you write this on a flying broomstick?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo!\u201d Potter snapped back, defensive.</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you simply not care about how you appear to your professors?\u201d Severus asked, warming to the rant. \u201cI suppose I can at least no longer take it personally. If this is the type of work you submit to your own Head of House\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI wrote it in the dark, okay?\u201d Potter exclaimed. \u201cThe lighting from the street isn\u2019t very bright in my room back at the Dursleys at night, so I did what I had to do. I\u2019d rewrite them if I had time, but I didn\u2019t think anyone would care. They\u2019re not illegible, are they? I still think my handwriting is probably clearer than Ron\u2019s.\u201d</p>\n<p>Severus frowned. \u201cWhy were you doing your homework at night?\u201d</p>\n<p>Potter cleared his throat, looking awkward now that his burst of anger was gone. \u201cMy aunt and uncle aren\u2019t the biggest fans of magic.\u201d</p>\n<p>From what Severus remembered of Petunia, that was likely the truth. He had never quite thought about what Lily\u2019s sister might have grown into. Surely Dumbledore wouldn\u2019t have left the boy with anyone less than doting. Still, it wasn\u2019t surprising that she was still harboring some resentment toward magic.</p>\n<p>When Severus didn\u2019t respond, Potter continued, \u201cIf they saw my books, they\u2019d confiscate them. I\u2019d have done everything during the day if I had the chance.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m surprised you did your homework at all with that sort of excuse. Children dream of having guardians who forbid them from doing their work.\u201d</p>\n<p>Potter snorted. \u201cI don\u2019t think any of my professors would accept that as a reason,\u201d he pointed out. \u201cBesides, if I did that, the Dursleys would win.\u201d</p>\n<p>Severus wasn\u2019t surprised to learn that Potter saw his relationship with his guardians as a competition, but he couldn\u2019t help but to agree. If Petunia was anywhere near as nasally and uptight as she\u2019d been the last time he\u2019d seen her, Severus was sure that subverting her rules was an enjoyable pastime. No wonder Potter had ended up the way he was.</p>\n<p>Severus skimmed the first few lines of the essay again, and then shrugged. \u201cYou\u2019ll have the chance to improve your handwriting when you rewrite this.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cRewrite it?\u201d Potter repeated.</p>\n<p>Dipping his quill in the inkpot, Severus slashed through the second sentence before nodding. \u201cRewrite it. Once I\u2019m done correcting this, Minerva won\u2019t be able to see your original handwriting anyway.\u201d</p>\n<p>Potter gulped audibly. It was a supremely satisfying noise.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">#</p>\n<p>Over the next week, against all odds, Harry fell into a rhythm in Snape\u2019s house. He spent his mornings working in the garden. Though he had made snippy comments about the yarrow incident for days, Harry had proven his skill enough for Snape to allow him into his magical greenhouse to continue his work there. Harry took that permission as tacit agreement of their deal\u2014as Harry continued to prune and weed the gardens, Snape continued both to fix both breakfast and dinner for him. Harry wasn\u2019t sure which of them owed the other for their nightly homework routine. Harry would hopefully end the experience with better scores, but Snape was the only one who seemed to enjoy the encounters.</p>\n<p>Harry thought that if Snape took as much vicious glee grading every paper as he did editing Harry\u2019s summer work, Snape loved being a professor more than Harry would have ever guessed.</p>\n<p>There were still times when Snape sent mixed messages, and Harry felt like he was constantly scrambling not to break any unsaid rules.</p>\n<p>Then, one morning, Harry woke up with a sharp, painful tickle in his throat, and a nose so congested he was left breathing through his mouth. He hacked a cough, and then bit his tongue to quiet the noise.</p>\n<p>At breakfast, he felt exhausted and uninterested in the food, but he forced himself to swallow the poached eggs and toast Snape had made. Snape, enraptured as always by the morning <em>Prophet</em>, didn\u2019t seem to notice.</p>\n<p>That was for the best. The last time Harry had been sick, Aunt Petunia had thrown a fit. Though she\u2019d thrown him a few packs of expired cold medicine when he was laid up in his room, she had refused to give him any extra attention. As she\u2019d said, if he couldn\u2019t be bothered to cook for himself, he didn\u2019t deserve to eat.</p>\n<p>Harry could imagine how much worse Snape\u2019s reaction would be. The professor, despite his profession, seemed to have no sympathy for weaknesses of any kind. Snape hadn\u2019t even volunteered to have Harry in his house at all. A sick Harry? There was no chance that would be tolerated.</p>\n<p>After breakfast, Harry drank a full glass of water, steeled himself, and then went outside.</p>\n<p>At first, it seemed as though he\u2019d be able to continue on without issue. Though he coughed and sniffled, his movements felt mostly strong. Then, as the day progressed and the pain in his head and throat worsened, Harry\u2019s breathing grew ragged.</p>\n<p>He had moved into the magical greenhouse to work now that the outside gardens were done, and the additional heat and moisture of the shed made Harry feel as though he was pushing his limbs through syrup.</p>\n<p>He knelt to pick up a watering can, and stumbled. He stayed sitting on the ground for a moment, trying to catch his breath. There was gray at the edges of his vision, and his head was spinning like he\u2019d just woken up from a nightmare. What time was it? Should he go inside to try to find some sort of lunch, or to at least drink some water?</p>\n<p>That wasn\u2019t their deal, though. It had been implied that Harry was supposed to work all day\u2014hadn\u2019t it? The thoughts were a bit difficult to hold on to.</p>\n<p>Shaking his head, Harry clambered to his feet. In a rush, the gray that had been teasing his eyes swarmed in, fuzzing out his vision entirely.</p>\n<p>Then, everything was dark.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">#</p>\n<p>When the emergency alarm appeared beside Severus\u2019s head, his first thought was that he\u2019d absently messed up one of his potion timers. Then, he identified the buzzing shape as the small snitch he\u2019d set up to monitor Potter. The alarm, inspired by a spell overprotective mothers set on their children, was set to alert him when the boy was injured. He\u2019d made some modifications for severity\u2014considering how often the boy had ended up in the Hospital Wing, Severus assumed he\u2019d have been getting daily warnings for general clumsiness.</p>\n<p>Potter was a target for many dark wizards, including the particular escaped convict that had been a large part of Dumbledore\u2019s reason for sticking him with the boy, and Severus had not wanted to be caught off-guard if the boy was attacked.</p>\n<p>He followed the spectral snitch at a brisk walk, resisting the urge to run only by reminding himself that if anyone could find a way to break his alarm system, it was Potter. If he reached the boy and found out that he\u2019d caused a false alarm on purpose, he didn\u2019t want to risk seeming invested. He held his wand at the ready, however, mentally preparing the spells he would need to bind Black or any other attacker.</p>\n<p>When he found the boy, though, there were no Dark wizards to be found. He was sprawled on the floor of the greenhouse, but there were no disturbances to the area around him. If someone else had been there, they hadn\u2019t triggered the wards, and they\u2019d managed to escape in the last two minutes. Severus walked closer and then kneeled beside the unconscious child, already murmuring a diagnosis spell. The astral snitch vanished just as Potter sat up. Their heads nearly collided before Potter noticed Severus looming over him and jolted backward.</p>\n<p>Potter reached up and touched the back of his head gingerly, and then scrubbed a hand over his face. \u201cWhat\u2026?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI was going to ask you the same question,\u201d Severus said. \u00a0</p>\n<p>The boy blinked, and then his face went blank. \u201cNothing. I\u2019m fine.\u201d</p>\n<p>When he tried to stand up, Severus stopped him with a hand on his shoulder. \u201cYou\u2019ll interfere with my spell,\u201d Severus told him. Just then, though, the diagnosis came back. A series of lights appeared on Potter\u2019s form. Purple, on the back of his head, marked an abrasion from where he\u2019d hit the floor, but it was relatively mild. More alarming was the green cloud of sickness drowning his face and lungs, and the pink haze over his chest and head that signified a fever.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re sick,\u201d Severus said. Now that he looked at the boy, he saw that his face was alarmingly pale, and there was a cloudiness to his gaze he\u2019d seen in a hundred fevered students over the years.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not,\u201d Potter said, and struggled to his feet. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p>\n<p>Severus rose with him, making sure he didn\u2019t lose his balance again. With Potter\u2019s luck, the next time he passed out would be directly onto a sharp gardening tool, and then where would they be then?</p>\n<p>Potter took a shaky breath and then reached to the table and <em>picked up his watering can again.</em></p>\n<p>\u201cYou idiot boy,\u201d Severus snarled. \u201cWhat are you thinking?\u201d</p>\n<p>Potter jumped at his exclamation, but didn\u2019t loosen his grip on the pail. \u201cI can keep working. It won\u2019t happen again.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re bloody right it won\u2019t,\u201d Severus said.</p>\n<p>Potter nodded once, and then turned away from him. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I bothered you.\u201d He still didn\u2019t seem steady on his feet, and Severus stayed close. If he had to catch a dramatically swooning Potter, he at least wanted them not to both be grievously injured in the process.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou cannot possibly be as dense as you\u2019re pretending,\u201d Severus growled.</p>\n<p>Potter didn\u2019t turn back to him. \u201cI can work,\u201d he said again.</p>\n<p>\u201cStop trying to play the martyr! None of your fans are here to applaud. You\u2019ll not work another minute out here today.\u201d</p>\n<p>Finally, Potter whirled on him. The movement left him unstable for a moment, but he regained his balance without falling. \u201cMake up your mind!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMy mind? I couldn\u2019t have been more clear with you, you imbecile,\u201d Severus snapped.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re mad at me for interrupting you and taking a break, but now you\u2019re telling me to stop working! How is that clear?\u201d The boy was breathing heavily, and there was a fire of defiance in his eyes. Under that, though, Severus recognized a wild desperation, like Potter knew he was being reckless by shouting. \u201cI don\u2019t understand what you want from me!\u201d</p>\n<p>Severus swelled with anger at the boy\u2019s defiance\u2026and then paused. There was defiance and anger in Potter\u2019s voice, yes. But, unless Severus was wrong, it came from confusion, not malice. There was nothing that should have been so baffling about this conversation, even with Severus\u2019s abominable reputation. Surely Potter could not genuinely believe that Severus was going to send him directly back to work after the boy had passed out in his greenhouse. If he had, he should have argued against the unfairness, not tried to work more without a complaint.</p>\n<p>\u201cDumbledore put you in my care,\u201d Severus said. He picked his words carefully, examining the boy\u2019s reactions for more clues. There was something going on here that he hadn\u2019t expected, hadn\u2019t factored into his plans for their interactions, and Severus did not appreciate stumbling about in the dark. \u201cIt\u2019s my job this summer to keep you safe. It would seem that today that means being sure that you rest, instead of working yourself into another faint.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut this is <em>my</em> job,\u201d Potter said, gesturing to the plants.</p>\n<p>\u201cYour job is to stay here with me until you\u2019re safe back at Hogwarts,\u201d Severus said. \u201c\u2019This\u2019 is extra. The plants certainly survived without you until now. Or, if they didn\u2019t survive, it wasn\u2019t a tragedy for me. This work doesn\u2019t need to be done. Especially not at the cost of your health.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cI may be a monster in many ways, but I would not treat you like slave labor. I suppose the jump isn\u2019t so extreme, considering our past interactions, but you seem to misunderstand our roles here.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not slave labor. You\u2019re letting me stay here,\u201d Potter said. There was still an edge of anger in his voice, as though he was frustrated by their miscommunications. He was still pale and shaky, but the defiant tension in his jaw said he wasn\u2019t ready to back down easily. \u201cYou can\u2019t send me back to the Dursleys again. I\u2019ve been helping, making up for it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re not being sent back to your relatives,\u201d Severus said. He had sent a letter to Dumbledore after the first day of their cohabitation asking the same question, and had been informed that Potter\u2019s parting stunt\u2014which Dumbledore had avoided describing explicitly\u2014had been bad enough that his uncle was refusing to set eyes on the boy until next summer. \u201cIf anyone owes me something for this situation, it\u2019s Professor Dumbledore for putting us both in this situation. While I do not mean to give you free rein over my house, which includes a workshop that would be dangerous for both you and my work, you are not required to pay your way.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand,\u201d Potter admitted.</p>\n<p>\u201cMerlin, boy, I don\u2019t know how else to say this. You. Do. Not. Need. To. Work. For. Me. Homework, yes. I will be ensuring that you finish your work as assigned. But I am not so desperate as to need a thirteen-year-old helping me around the house. You\u2019re not a servant.\u201d Severus sniffed. \u201cI have no expectations that you would trust me, but I assume you\u2019d at least trust Dumbledore not to put you into such a situation.\u201d</p>\n<p>That last bit, which Severus thought would clinch the argument, just seemed to make Potter droop.</p>\n<p>\u201cNow, come inside. It\u2019s hot out here, and hotter still inside this greenhouse. You need water.\u201d</p>\n<p>Potter followed him back inside the house, quiet and thoughtful.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">#</p>\n<p>Though Harry was still reeling from the strange conversation with Snape and the knock he\u2019d gotten on the head, the glass of water Snape made him drink in the kitchen made him feel slightly clearer. Once the professor had carefully watched him drink the first glass and then poured him a second, he moved around the kitchen to prepare lunch.</p>\n<p>Harry thought he\u2019d have a moment to close his eyes, but then Snape asked, \u201cDoes Molly Weasley force you to work for her when you\u2019ve stayed at their home during the summers? I know you were there last year. The incident with the flying car was quite memorable.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou mean when you tried to expel me?\u201d Harry snapped.</p>\n<p>\u201cPrecisely,\u201d Snape said with an unapologetic shrug. \u201cI\u2019ve heard the Weasley matron can be a taskmaster. Does she send you to weed her garden until you\u2019ve passed out from exhaustion as well? Since that seems to be the standard of your expectations.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShe would never,\u201d Harry said defiantly, feeling protective of Mrs. Weasley despite knowing that even her children would have called her taskmaster if they\u2019d been sure she couldn\u2019t hear. \u201cShe wouldn\u2019t let a guest do any work.\u201d</p>\n<p>Snape made a gesture as though expecting that to mean something extra.</p>\n<p>\u201cMr. and Mrs. Weasley wanted me to stay with their family,\u201d Harry pointed out when Snape didn\u2019t continue.</p>\n<p>\u201cFine,\u201d Snape said. \u201cWhat about your relatives? If there\u2019s a similar scenario where you may be expected to work for your room and board, I suppose one could consider that it, despite the familial bond. After all, many guardians expect their children to help about the house. You believe they would let you work yourself to death?\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry didn\u2019t answer. The response on his tongue was a loud and resounding <em>yes</em>. Of course he was supposed to work until he couldn\u2019t stand for the Dursleys. They\u2019d made that clear to him since he had been old enough to understand, and hadn\u2019t let up on that policy since. There was something strange in Snape\u2019s voice, though, something so dismissive and confident that Harry felt a strange tug of shame. What would Snape say if he knew the blithe comments he was making were true? There was already enough judgement in his tone. Harry didn\u2019t want to fuel Snape for all of his future arguments by admitting that he was right, or by complaining about the Dursleys.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He imagined, vividly, Snape bringing up Harry\u2019s home life during Potions, airing Harry\u2019s life of chores to a snickering, pampered Malfoy. <em>What are you, a house-elf? I always knew you were trash.</em> Malfoy would love to learn that someone loathed him as much as he did, especially if that someone had raised him. This kind of ammunition would fuel Malfoy for years.</p>\n<p>\u201cIf anything, just remember that I\u2019m fully aware that you can and will report anything I do to torment you to Professor Dumbledore, and that I\u2019m not interested in sabotaging my own career,\u201d Snape said before setting a bowl of soup in front of Harry. Harry wasn\u2019t sure if he\u2019d used magic to make it more quickly, or if Harry had just zoned out for longer than he\u2019d thought.</p>\n<p>Snape left the room, but returned quickly, setting down a glass vial beside the glass of water. \u201cDrink this.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry glanced up at him, suspicious.</p>\n<p>With an unreasonably dramatic eye roll, Snape said, \u201cI\u2019m not trying to poison you. Have you listened to a word I\u2019ve said to you today, or has it all fallen on deaf ears? I\u2019m getting tired of repeating myself. If you want this cold gone before you pass out again, you\u2019ll drink what I give you when I give it to you.\u201d</p>\n<p>It was that reminder that Snape was irritated and therefore likely not going to waste time deceiving Harry that made him uncork the bottle and swallow it. It tasted of distilled peppermint, and bit his throat with a frigid coldness on the way down. \u00a0</p>\n<p>After he ate, Snape herded him toward his bedroom. He tapped his foot impatiently until Harry crawled into bed, still in his freshly-cleaned working clothes. Harry resented being treated like a child, but he was grateful he was lying down when the potion\u2019s effects hit. Suddenly, the exhaustion from working the whole morning overwhelmed him, and his head swam. The magic traveled from where it had entered his stomach and moved back up his throat into his sinuses. The sensation tickled, like ice was growing throughout his insides. He hadn\u2019t realized how warm he felt until the pleasant chill spread completely.</p>\n<p>From then, it didn\u2019t take long for Harry to slip away into sleep.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">#</p>\n<p>For the next two days, Snape refused to let Harry leave the house. It was only when Harry insisted that he would lose his mind from boredom that Snape even conceded to let him continue doing his homework in the living room during the evenings. Even then, though, Snape kept an eagle eye on him, seeming to know the moment Harry\u2019s energy started to flag.</p>\n<p>The soup he made was consistently over-salted, and the potions ranged from a painful blast of peppermint to a bitter sludge, but Harry slowly began to feel better. It was\u2026strange, being taken care of so attentively. The only other time Harry had experienced someone paying attention to his health had been during his various stays in the Hospital Wing, and then it had been Madam Pomfrey\u2019s job to watch over him.</p>\n<p>If it hadn\u2019t been for the constant eye-rolling, Harry thought that this was what it might have been like to be taken care of by a parent.</p>\n<p>Dudley had been a hardy child, but had complained viciously about the slightest inconveniences. Aunt Petunia had never been particularly warm or nurturing, but she had always gone above and beyond any time she thought Dudley was in pain. Though Harry had been the one doing the cooking, she\u2019d made sure Dudley\u2019s favorite meals were prepared, and that someone (Harry) was there to answer his every demand. She\u2019d smothered Dudley so thoroughly that Harry had always been partially glad that he\u2019d never received the same treatment.</p>\n<p>(Or so he\u2019d thought when he was healthy. Later, when he was in his cupboard under all the blankets he could smuggle out from Aunt Petunia\u2019s watchful eye and shaking so hard that his teeth chattered, he dreamed of what it would be like for her to care for him half as much as she did Dudley.)</p>\n<p>Luckily, Snape wasn\u2019t quite as overbearing, but he was <em>attentive</em>. If Harry hadn\u2019t known better, it almost seemed like he <em>cared</em>.</p>\n<p>Harry couldn\u2019t understand it. Why wasn\u2019t Snape threatening to kick Harry back to the Dursleys, or to send him back to the Leaky Cauldron? He should have been calculating the cost of the potions ingredients he\u2019d poured down Harry\u2019s throat, and the time he\u2019d wasted brewing them. He should have been counting down the seconds until Harry was well enough to get back to work.</p>\n<p>Instead, he was being patient and casual. Snape acted like his attitude was expected. Like it was normal for him to take care of Harry, though he was only even letting Harry stay in his house because Dumbledore had forced him to. When Harry tried to hide how poorly he was feeling or offered to go back to work, Snape just ignored him and told him to focus on getting better before he accidentally killed himself.</p>\n<p>Where was the line? Harry was coughing and sneezing loudly all day and night. He was useless around the house. One morning, he\u2019d even forgotten to make his bed in the haze of his sickness. At what point would Snape finally snap?</p>\n<p>The next morning, Harry woke up with a head clear from mucus, but still full of doubts. His footing in Snape\u2019s house had been shaken, and he didn\u2019t know where he stood. When was the other shoe going to drop? The longer he waited, the tenser he felt.</p>\n<p>When he got up for breakfast, he deliberately left his covers in a rumpled mess at the foot of the bed, and his door cracked open so Snape would see. Snape didn\u2019t comment.</p>\n<p>At breakfast, he asked for a second helping of toast. Snape not only gave him the toast, but made a comment about being relieved that Harry was better. He sneered about no longer needing to play nursemaid, but there was no real bite in it. He still didn\u2019t mention the cost of the potions or the food.</p>\n<p>After double-checking him for a fever, Snape cleared Harry for work in the greenhouse again if he wanted. Harry, after a quick breath to steel his nerves, said that he didn\u2019t want to work that day. Not that he wasn\u2019t feeling better enough, not that he didn\u2019t think he was well enough to do the job right\u2014just that he didn\u2019t want to.</p>\n<p>And Snape <em>shrugged</em>.</p>\n<p>\u201cJust don\u2019t come into my lab,\u201d he said, and then went back to his morning paper. \u00a0</p>\n<p>Harry spent the day lounging in his room, slightly annoyed at himself for sabotaging his chance to get back outside. After being sick so long, he was desperate for some sunshine, but he\u2019d already told Snape he didn\u2019t want to work. He waited for Snape to come by his door, see that he seemed healthy and send him out to the greenhouse, but it never happened. Instead, Harry was alone and <em>bored</em>. Other than hearing Snape walk to and from the kitchen in the middle of the day, Harry could almost have been there by himself.</p>\n<p>Finally, he sat up. Why was he suffering through boredom? He wanted to see how far he could push Snape. The longer he walked on eggshells, the longer this whole farce would be drawn out.</p>\n<p>He grabbed his Nimbus from his trunk, which was still packed at the foot of his bed, and then left the house. He slammed the door loudly behind him, and then waited for a long moment just outside for Snape to appear. When his professor remained absent, Harry shook his head and went into the yard.</p>\n<p>For the first several minutes, he kept his broom close to the ground. How would Snape react? If he had a spell that would knock Harry off the broom, Harry didn\u2019t want a long fall. When he realized Snape wasn\u2019t coming, though, Harry started to widen his slow loop around the property.</p>\n<p>With Snape\u2019s wards, Harry had a space half the size of the Hogwarts Quidditch pitch to fly around, which was plenty for him to build up a bit of speed and test some of the moves he\u2019d read about in one of the Quidditch books Hermione had given him.</p>\n<p>Other than one move that left him skidding across the grass, the next several hours passed smoothly. If gardening had helped Harry escape some of the tension of his situation, flying made him feel absolutely weightless. He laughed to himself as he did a quick roll over Snape\u2019s roof, imagining that he was ducking a wayward Bludger.</p>\n<p>Flying was one of the many things he missed about magic during the summers. He\u2019d been jealous of the Weasleys\u2019 makeshift pitch. How much better would Harry be at flying if he had a chance to practice those extra three free months? Oliver would be delighted to know that Harry was getting any flying time in over the summer. Harry would have to mention it during their first practice of the season.</p>\n<p>Hogwarts was so close Harry could almost taste the Welcome Feast. He only had two weeks left with Snape before he\u2019d be back home.</p>\n<p>He frowned, his speed slowing slightly. He just had to survive two more weeks. Why was he risking Snape\u2019s wrath by sneaking out for a flying session? Would this be enough for Snape to put him out on his own\u2014or worse, send him back to the Dursleys? It was no wonder that Aunt Petunia loathed taking care of him. Harry couldn\u2019t resist poking and prodding the restraints set by authority figures, searching for the boundaries he couldn\u2019t cross and finding the rules through trial and error. \u00a0</p>\n<p>If this was going to be his last chance to fly for the summer, he wasn\u2019t going to waste it. Harry pushed his worries out of his mind, and then leaned forward over his broom. It was time to test how fast he could go.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">#</p>\n<p>Since Potter finally seemed stable enough, Severus had abandoned the soups he\u2019d been making the previous several days in favor of roast chicken and mashed potatoes that night. He\u2019d spent more time on the meal than usual, appreciating the empty kitchen while the boy had been outside.</p>\n<p>Besides, if he\u2019d had to eat soup one more day, he might have lost his mind.</p>\n<p>It had been a relief this morning when Potter had finally woken up without a fever. Severus had poured every potion he\u2019d had on hand down the boy\u2019s throat, but Potter had exacerbated what seemed an otherwise minor cold with his shenanigans that day in the greenhouse.</p>\n<p>To Severus\u2019s surprise, the boy had been a perfect patient, apart from an irritating need to constantly demur the potions Severus gave him. If there had been any student Severus would have expected to arrogantly see Severus\u2019s carefully-brewed potionwork as a given, it would have been Potter.</p>\n<p>But then, Severus was starting to think there were many assumptions he\u2019d made about the boy that were established on shaky ground. The Potter he\u2019d thought he\u2019d known would have jumped at the opportunity to lay around and be pampered. He\u2019d always imagined James Potter having his parents feed him with a silver spoon, and had never imagined anything different of Harry. Instead, the look Potter had given him every time Severus handed him a spell hadn\u2019t indicated any level of entitlement. If anything, his wary expression had reminded Severus of\u2026himself.</p>\n<p>It seemed more likely that Severus was projecting. Why would Potter need to look like a stray dog, someone more accustomed to a raised hand than a helpful one? Severus had given the boy ample reason to hate him over the last two years of their acquaintance, but never a reason to <em>fear</em> him. Had he?</p>\n<p>Last month, the idea of Potter harboring some healthy fear for him might have been satisfying. He would have seen it as a sign of the respect the boy had never seemed to possess. Now, though, that the boy was alone in a house with him and vulnerable, it made Severus feel like a monster.</p>\n<p>Not that Severus had done much in his life to avoid the label of monster. Still, he preferred to earn the title, not shoulder it by default.</p>\n<p>\u201cI saw you went flying today,\u201d Severus commented, taking a sip of wine.</p>\n<p>Across the table, Potter froze. He looked up, knife still stuck in the piece of chicken he had been cutting. There was that look again, like he expected Severus to lunge across the table or throw a hex at him. He didn\u2019t respond. It looked like he was holding his breath.</p>\n<p>\u201cDo try to avoid running into the wards around the property. I\u2019d hate to be forced to scrap you from the ground, and I don\u2019t believe the Headmaster would take kindly to it.\u201d Then, Severus went back to his meal.</p>\n<p>There was a long beat of silence, and then Potter asked, \u201cIs that it?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cJust be aware that no amount of practice will allow Gryffindor to steal another Quidditch Cup,\u201d Severus said.</p>\n<p>Potter didn\u2019t respond, but he gave Severus strange looks throughout dinner. Then, when they were almost finished, he began <em>tapping</em>.</p>\n<p>Rapidly, rhythmically tapping his fork on every surface in front of him.</p>\n<p>\u201cDesist,\u201d Severus said when he realized the boy wasn\u2019t slowing down.</p>\n<p>Potter just raised his eyebrows innocently and stopped. He waited until Severus looked back at the potions journal he was reading before starting again.</p>\n<p>Severus narrowed his eyes across the table at him. \u201cStop that.\u201d Potter, defiant, met his eyes.</p>\n<p>Finally, Severus cast a quick Silencing charm across the table to mute the noise.</p>\n<p>Severus thought that would be the end of it, but despite the silence, the boy kept doing it. Even without the noise, the flurry of movement in Severus\u2019s periphery combined with the slight shaking of the table to drive him to distraction. From the look on Potter\u2019s face, he knew how annoying he was being, and he was <em>daring</em> Severus to do something. What strange, misinformed Gryffindor nonsense was this? Severus had spent days taking care of the boy and then allowed the boy to go flying without the punishment he seemed to expect.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Finally, Severus had had enough. Slamming down his fork and knife, he glared at Potter. \u201cThat is <em>it</em>!\u201d he exclaimed. \u201cI\u2019m trying to finish my dinner, and you\u2019re deliberately driving me out of my mind.\u201d The boy stopped his tapping and waited, a challenge in his gaze. \u201cIf you can\u2019t sit still, go to your <em>room</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>Potter stared, slack-jawed, back at him.</p>\n<p>Severus pointed firmly toward the kitchen door.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s <em>it</em>?\u201d Potter demanded, making Severus regret not extending the Silencing charm to the boy himself.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, Potter. That is it. I\u2019ve had enough.\u201d</p>\n<p>Potter waved aside that explanation as if Severus had missed the point. \u201cThat\u2019s all you\u2019re going to do?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat, were you expecting me to join into your grating impromptu drum solo?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy aren\u2019t you sending me away?\u201d Potter burst. \u201cI was sick for days, I refused to work today, and I\u2019ve been annoying you tonight <em>on purpose</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI noticed that last one,\u201d Snape said dryly. \u201cAre you trying to get sent away?\u201d</p>\n<p>Potter shook his head. \u201cI mean, why aren\u2019t you <em>punishing</em> me? Why aren\u2019t you taking away my food privileges or adding bars to my windows or caning me?\u201d</p>\n<p>It took most of Severus\u2019s considerable training not to blanch at that litany. The boy had clearly conflated Severus and Filch in his mind. Even Filch was controlled by Dumbledore, though. Did he really think Severus was going to <em>starve</em> him? Merlin, could the boy have been more dramatic? Severus was torn between annoyance and horror. Dumbledore must have been mad when he\u2019d sent Potter to live there. \u201cDo you want to be sent back to your aunt and uncle for the rest of the summer?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo!\u201d Potter exclaimed, growing pale.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019d only need to ask, you know. No reason for hysterics. I\u2019m not holding you hostage. I\u2019ll remind you that I didn\u2019t precisely volunteer for this,\u201d Severus said.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, no. You can\u2019t send me back,\u201d Potter said.</p>\n<p>\u201cThen walk me through just exactly is happening in that brain of yours. Merlin knows I can\u2019t understand what you\u2019re attempting here. Do you want to work, or don\u2019t you? Do you want to stay here or not? Try being clear and using your words, Potter.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou don\u2019t understand? <em>I</em> don\u2019t understand!\u201d Potter said, a thread of desperation in his voice. \u201cYou\u2019re not doing anything I thought you would! I\u2019m just waiting for you to actually do something, and it\u2019s driving me insane! You\u2019ve been\u2026 You\u2019ve been\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>Severus gestured for him to continue.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been taking care of me,\u201d Potter finally finished, sounding both baffled and horrified. \u201cEven when I\u2019ve been bad. I don\u2019t know where the line is.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe line where I refuse to take care of you anymore?\u201d Severus confirmed, keeping his voice silky and light, using Potter\u2019s own term so they would be on the same page.</p>\n<p>\u201cExactly,\u201d Potter said.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd when I stop taking care of you, that\u2019s when there will be window bars and starvation?\u201d</p>\n<p>Potter hesitated. Smart boy. He\u2019d finally seemed to realize that Severus\u2019s quietness was a trap. \u201cYes?\u201d he offered.</p>\n<p>\u201cPotter,\u201d Severus said firmly, resisting the urge to rub his temples. \u201cI\u2019m in charge of your safety for the duration of the summer. Technically, I\u2019m always in charge of your safety, being your professor. But this summer, I\u2019m responsible for you. That\u2019s true whether you\u2019re being helpful or being a brat.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut\u2026\u201d Potter said, clearly not convinced.</p>\n<p>\u201cThere are certain obligations I have to you as a child in my care. When you\u2019re sick, I\u2019ll help you get better. When you\u2019re about to turn in your chicken-scratch to your professors, I\u2019ll intercede and make you rewrite it. When you\u2019re hungry, I\u2019ll provide food. None of these are unreasonable demands, no matter what you seem to think of me. If you act out, I\u2019ll send you to your room for my own peace of mind. Your punishments will match the crime, and they\u2019ll be explained in advance. If the situation grows desperate enough that I cannot fulfill my charge from Dumbledore to care for you, I\u2019ll be sure you have somewhere more suitable to go before I kick you out. You won\u2019t be thrown onto the streets.\u201d Severus took a deep breath. \u201cI may be\u2026volatile, at school, but I do have rules, both for myself and those under my care.\u201d</p>\n<p>Severus had still half-expected Potter to roll his eyes at that slow explanation, laughing that he\u2019d never been afraid of any of that. Instead, Potter just seemed cautiously awed.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd those rules are\u2026?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve told you them before. No going into my lab. No flying or walking past the wards. No tapping at the dinner table,\u201d he said, raising an eyebrow pointedly.</p>\n<p>Potter frowned. \u201cAre you sure that\u2019s all?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes.\u201d Potter was still hesitant, watching Severus from across the table like he was being faced like an unknown, poisonous spider. \u201cOr,\u201d Severus added, voice growing waspish, \u201cI could just beat you for every minor infraction, whether or not you knew it existed. Would that be preferable?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cKind of,\u201d Potter said with a strangled laugh. \u201cAt least then I wouldn\u2019t have to keep waiting for it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Severus stilled. Very, very quietly, he asked, \"Is that what your aunt and uncle would do?\"</p>\n<p>Potter matched his stillness, those bright green eyes darting over Severus's expression as though he was looking for the right answer. Not finding what he was looking for, he prevaricated, \"Well... I mean, I...\" Then he shrugged helplessly.</p>\n<p>\"You wanted to know my rules? This is one. I need honesty from you. When I ask you a question, you need to tell me the truth. Not what you think I want to hear, not what you think will get you in the least trouble\u2014the truth. That is not a rule you wish to break to test me.\u201d After Potter absorbed that, Severus continued, \u201cNow. I\u2019m asking what types of punishments your aunt and uncle preferred.\u201d</p>\n<p>That rephrasing helped knock Potter from his frozen state. \u201cThey mostly just sent me to my room. That\u2019s not such a bad punishment now.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNow?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIn my new room. It\u2019s bigger, and there\u2019s even a window I can look out of.\u201d</p>\n<p>What sort of room didn\u2019t have a window? Still, not as terrible as Severus had begun to imagine. If Severus had raised Potter, he imagined he\u2019d need time without him underfoot as well.</p>\n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s a flap where they can slide food in, if they\u2019re not too mad at me. That\u2019s probably their favorite punishment, since they don\u2019t have to deal with me. They can only do it when there\u2019s nothing they need from me right then, though,\u201d Potter said. \u201cIf I\u2019m supposed to be cooking, cleaning, gardening, or something, they have to find other ways.\u201d</p>\n<p>Severus gestured for him to continue. Potter just shrugged. Severus took a deep breath through his nose. \u201cFor example?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell. They yell at me. I\u2019ve learned how to mostly ignore that, though, so it\u2019s not very effective. Sometimes when Aunt Petunia is angry, she\u2019ll lock me out of the house so it\u2019s easier for Dudley to get at me. That\u2019s my cousin. He and his friends like to push me around.\u201d Severus\u2019s expression didn\u2019t change, which seemed to embolden the boy. \u201cAunt Petunia is pretty small compared to Dudley or Uncle Vernon, so there\u2019s not much she can do anyway. I just have to make sure not to annoy her in the kitchen where she can reach her frying pan.\u201d Potter rubbed absently at the side of his head, as though remembering a past injury.</p>\n<p>\u201cBut your uncle and cousin don\u2019t need kitchen instruments for their corporeal punishments?\u201d Severus prompted.</p>\n<p>Potter laughed. \u201cThey\u2019d be offended you thought they\u2019d need anything but their fists,\u201d he said. \u201cUncle Vernon would think it was weak to use a frying pan. But if you\u2019re looking for, um, inspiration, I\u2019d much rather be sent to my room without dinner,\u201d he added quickly.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019d prefer starvation to being beaten by a man five times your age,\u201d Severus said neutrally.</p>\n<p>Not neutrally enough. Potter flushed. \u201cIt\u2019s not like he was giving me black eyes every day,\u201d he said.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019d think not,\u201d Severus said. \u201cThat would have alerted your teachers to what was happening, and that would have stopped him from continuing. I\u2019m sure he was quite skilled at focusing his blows to where they would not be seen.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI had enough bruises from Dudley that no one would have noticed the difference. My teachers wouldn\u2019t have stopped him anyway,\u201d Potter said. \u201cThey don\u2019t have any control over how my guardians raise me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIs that something your aunt and uncle told you, or something you learned from experience?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBoth?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you sure? That sounded like a question.\u201d</p>\n<p>Potter looked frustrated again. \u201cYou\u2019re talking in circles. I can tell you\u2019re trying to get me to say something, but I can\u2019t tell what.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAs I said before, I\u2019m looking for honesty. As long as you\u2019re telling the truth, you\u2019re saying what I want you to say,\u201d Severus reminded him. \u201cSo. Did you enjoy being a punching bag for your relatives?</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course not! I hate the Dursleys,\u201d Potter exclaimed.</p>\n<p>\u201cThen why have you never told anyone about this?\u201d</p>\n<p>Potter blinked. \u201cWho was I supposed to tell?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYour teachers, for a start. If not in your Muggle schools, then at Hogwarts.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe Dursleys weren\u2019t at Hogwarts.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThank you for clarifying that,\u201d Severus drawled, and Potter flushed angrily. \u201cYou did not think that a Hogwarts professor would have found a way to intervene? Your Head of House, perhaps?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMcGonagall has more important things to worry about. I stayed at Hogwarts for all the holidays. I just had to survive the summers. What was she supposed to do then?\u201d Potter hesitated. \u201cI did ask if I could stay for the summer my first year, but Dumbledore said that I couldn\u2019t. No students can stay in the castle then. There\u2019s also some sort of magic bond with the Dursleys. He didn\u2019t explain it, but he said I\u2019d be safe there.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDid you explain your exact circumstances to the Headmaster?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t going to bother Dumbledore about that stuff,\u201d Potter said. \u201cThe only time he talks to me is after Voldemort has almost killed me. It would be stupid to complain about the Dursleys after that.\u201d Severus was about to point out the ridiculousness of that statement\u2014after all, Voldemort wouldn\u2019t need to concern himself with the boy if his relatives managed to kill him first\u2014but the boy continued. \u201cBesides, my Hogwarts letter was addressed to my cupboard. I assumed Dumbledore already knew everything, and just\u2026decided it was worth the cost.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCupboard?\u201d Severus repeated, voice very cold and very soft.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat was my room before I took Dudley\u2019s old one,\u201d Potter explained.</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course. Is there anything else I should know about your living situation with your relatives?\u201d he asked. When Potter shook his head, Severus nodded decisively. \u201cVery well.\u201d Standing up and pulling out his wand\u2014noting the boy\u2019s flinch\u2014Severus cast a Patronus. The resulting doe was very faint, a physical manifestation of his shaken nerves. \u201cTell the Headmaster that I need his presence at Spinner's End. Now.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat? What are you doing?\u201d Potter exclaimed.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m putting an end to this.\u201d</p>\n<p>Potter, if anything, looked more panicked. \u201cYou said that I just had to tell the truth! You can\u2019t send me back. I\u2019m sorry for complaining.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going back there. You\u2019re not going back there ever again.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"center\">#</p>\n<p>Harry reeled. His dinner was still half-finished on the table in front of him, but the night had taken a dramatic turn. Snape was standing at the other end of the table, looking absolutely thunderous. And, if Harry wasn\u2019t completely mistaken, it was for Harry\u2019s sake.</p>\n<p>When he\u2019d told Snape about life at the Dursleys, he\u2019d expected sneering. Maybe a comment about how the great Harry Potter could face down Voldemort, but whinged about being bullied by his relatives. Maybe Snape would even congratulate the Dursleys on keeping Harry in line.</p>\n<p>Instead, he\u2019d called Dumbledore.</p>\n<p>\u201cSir, don\u2019t overreact,\u201d Harry said. \u201cMaybe I didn\u2019t explain it right.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDid you lie to me?\u201d Snape asked.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Harry said quickly, remembering the rule of the night.</p>\n<p>\u201cThen I believe I\u2019m reacting perfectly reasonably.\u201d He took a breath so deep it seemed to pain him, and then sat back down. \u201cPotter,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat you have experienced at the hands of your guardians is entirely unacceptable. You have been abused and neglected for years, and it seems no one knew the breadth of the situation until now. So it is up to me to right it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou make it sound like\u2026\u201d Harry floundered for the words. \u201cYou make it sound like I\u2019m some poor abused kid. I wasn\u2019t always the victim. I deserved some of what happened.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou deserved none of it. Children are not punching bags for their guardians. Starvation is never an appropriate punishment. From your reaction when you got sick, I assume that your aunt had you doing household chores far beyond what could be reasonably expected. Did you ever pass out under her care?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026\u201d Harry was sure now that the answer would only make Snape angrier. \u201cSir, I\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBe honest, Potter. If you learned that Miss Granger had been kept in a cupboard by her parents, would you tell her she had deserved it?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course not,\u201d Harry said impatiently. \u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI know you think you\u2019re very special, Potter. I\u2019ve known that since the day I met you. I just never realized that you took it in quite the opposite direction as I\u2019d expected. You are worth protecting, Potter. It seems the adults in your lives have done a horrific job of it so far, but you are worth protecting.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry, for some reason, felt like crying.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo wonder you ended up taking on Voldemort on your own when you were eleven. I always thought you believed you could handle it alone. But the truth was, you didn\u2019t think anyone would help you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI tried to tell Professor McGonagall!\u201d Harry interjected, finding the one part of that rant he could even respond to.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd she dismissed your worries about Voldemort as the wild fantasies of an eleven-year-old with delusions of grandeur. Then, this past year, you assumed she would say the same about your discovery of the Chamber of Secrets, and you managed it on your own.\u201d Snape shook his head. \u201cMinerva will loathe herself for this.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou can\u2019t tell her.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCan\u2019t I?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPlease,\u201d Harry said. Would McGonagall respond this strongly? Would she feel like she\u2019d failed Harry? Or, worse, would she think that Snape and Harry were overreacting and that Harry was weak for needing help from his own relatives?</p>\n<p>Snape paused and gave Harry a considering look. \u201cI won\u2019t tell anyone you do not give me explicit permission to bring into your confidence,\u201d he said. \u201cExcept,\u201d he added before Harry could speak, \u201cthe Headmaster.\u201d</p>\n<p>As though that had summoned him, there was a knock on the front door.</p>\n<p>Harry gave Snape a pleading look. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to do this.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI very much do. Wait in the living room.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry trudged into the living room and stood behind the couch, keeping it between him and the door. Snape opened the door, whispering something to Dumbledore that Harry couldn\u2019t hear. Over Snape\u2019s shoulder, Dumbledore gave Harry a brief, warm smile. Aflame with embarrassment and shame, Harry didn\u2019t manage to return the expression, and Dumbledore\u2019s smile fell.</p>\n<p>When Dumbledore took a step forward, Snape stepped aside to let him through, and then locked the door behind him. Since Harry knew Snape could have done that with a spell, if he needed to do it at all with the wards surrounding the area, he wondered if Snape was also regretting bringing Dumbledore into this.</p>\n<p>\u201cGood evening, Harry,\u201d Dumbledore said, striding into the living room. \u201cWon\u2019t you sit?\u201d he asked, glancing at Snape to see if he objected.</p>\n<p>Snape waved his assent, and Dumbledore settled onto the couch. Harry moved around the couch to the other side, but didn\u2019t sit. He was hyperaware of how close they were to the safety of his bedroom. Just a few steps, and Harry could escape this situation. Harry wasn\u2019t sure whether it was his conviction that Snape would drag him right back out again or a desire not to seem weak that stopped him from bolting.</p>\n<p>When he realized Harry wasn\u2019t going to speak, Dumbledore said, \u201cI must admit, I was alarmed to receive such an urgent message from Professor Snape, so I\u2019m relieved to see that you seem to be in good health. You are doing all right?\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry nodded.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s doing better now that he\u2019s here,\u201d Snape said, striding into the living room. Like Harry, he declined to sit, and instead stood beside his usual armchair. \u201cHeadmaster, Potter has been telling me some stories I believe you need to hear.\u201d When Harry didn\u2019t jump in, he continued, \u201cStories about his current guardians.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIndeed?\u201d Dumbledore asked.</p>\n<p>\u201cHeadmaster,\u201d Snape snapped. \u201cDid you know?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDid I know what, Severus?\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry felt faint.</p>\n<p>\u201cPotter\u2019s guardians are horrific specimens of human beings, Muggle or otherwise,\u201d Snape said. \u201cThey\u2019ve tormented the boy for years, and he says that when he requested not to return there last summer, his request was ignored.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2026\u201d Dumbledore paused, looking forlorn. \u201cI know that the Dursleys do not appreciate what they have in Harry. However, the magic of his blood relation through Lily is undeniably powerful. That house is the safest place for him.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo. I\u2019ll be damned if Potter spends another day with Petunia and her awful husband.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI appreciate you taking care of him these few weeks, but it is vital that he continues to see Privet Drive as his home. I\u2019ll be honest,\u201d Dumbledore continued, a spark of amusement in his eyes, \u201cthat I did not expect quite this result when I assigned Harry to stay here. Have you found yourself getting attached, Severus?\u201d</p>\n<p>Snape waved his hand as though dismissing that idea as absurd. \u201cYou\u2019re not listening,\u201d Snape said. \u201cYou never do, do you? Not with this sort of thing.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s only natural to feel protective of Harry, as it seems you now understand.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI understand. But do you? Have you ever asked Potter what his life is like in that house?\u201d</p>\n<p>Dumbledore looked over at Harry. Finally, he seemed to grow solemn to the situation. \u201cI always thought Harry would tell me if there was something truly wrong,\u201d he said softly.</p>\n<p>Harry, immediately, felt terrible for implying earlier that Dumbledore had known everything the Dursleys had done. Snape, however, was less forgiving. \u201cEven I could have told you that Potter would rather handle the monsters in his life without involving competent adults. You never checked in on him, not in all these years? I find that difficult to believe.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThere was only so much I could interfere, considering the Dursleys\u2019 distrust of magic. A wizard appearing on their doorstep to interrogate them about their parenting style would not have gone over well.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd you thought they\u2019d enjoy <em>raising</em> a wizard better? Professor Dumbledore, your golden boy has been abused for years. You\u2019re telling me you truly didn\u2019t know? Or that you just thought it was worth it so that the boy would turn into the person you needed him to be?\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry didn\u2019t realize that he made a sound until both adults looked over at him. \u201cI thought Potter would contribute to this conversation, but it seems to be upsetting him,\u201d Snape said. \u201cMy office, Headmaster.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d said Dumbledore slowly, looking older than Harry had ever seen him. \u201cI do believe that\u2019s wise.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPotter, stay here,\u201d Snape instructed, and then practically marched Dumbledore toward his lab.</p>\n<p>When the door shut behind them, Harry finally sat down. He put his head down into his shaking hands.</p>\n<p>He couldn\u2019t decide who was at more risk being trapped in the room with the other\u2014Snape or Dumbledore. Normally, Harry would bet on Dumbledore in any encounter, but Snape had been seething with a level of rage Harry had never seen from him before.</p>\n<p>It was honestly disconcerting to know that, for once, Snape\u2019s rage was on Harry\u2019s behalf instead of against him.</p>\n<p>Harry also, though, felt a warmth in his chest knowing that there was someone fighting for him behind that closed door, someone who had heard Harry\u2019s problems and not only believed him, but had decided to <em>champion</em> for him.</p>\n<p>What were they saying? Was Dumbledore explaining that Harry have over-exaggerated his woes? Would Snape come out angry at Harry? Or worse, were they both sitting with their heads together, shaking their heads about poor, pitiful Harry who couldn\u2019t even stand up to his own family? Dumbledore, who was so proud every time Harry managed to stop Voldemort\u2019s plans and save the world, would be disappointed that Harry had never been able to save himself.</p>\n<p>Feeling sick to his stomach, Harry waited.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">#</p>\n<p>To his credit, Dumbledore listened to Severus\u2019s recount of his conversations and experiences with Potter in attentive silence. His expression, so kind and warm when the boy had been in the room, had calmed into a stoic mask that betrayed no emotion. Severus tried to emulate the same, but could feel passion slipping into his tone.</p>\n<p>He explained Potter\u2019s strange behavior when he had arrived, the way he had tiptoed around Severus as though waiting for an explosion. He told the story of Potter requesting to work in his greenhouse, and then continuing to do so while sick until he lost consciousness. Finally, he summarized the conversation of that night.</p>\n<p>It felt, disturbingly, like a betrayal of Potter\u2019s trust to tell Dumbledore the details, but Severus worried that Dumbledore would dismiss his claims if they were too vague.</p>\n<p>Severus would need to find a way to regain the boy\u2019s trust.</p>\n<p>That thought jarred him enough that he paused mid-sentence, stunned. Since when had he cared about the boy beyond excavating him from his current home situation? Why did he feel the need to make sure Potter knew he was different than his guardians?</p>\n<p>Dumbledore took that breath to interrupt. \u201cThank you, Severus. I understand. I must admit, I\u2019m surprised to find you as the boy\u2019s champion, no matter the situation.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou honestly believe I would let Lily\u2019s son live in a cupboard?\u201d Severus snarled.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou never seemed to mind when it was James\u2019s son.\u201d</p>\n<p>Severus was silent for a moment, biting down on his initial gut response to disparage his childhood bully. \u201cNot even Potter\u2019s son deserves this abuse,\u201d Severus said. He cleared his throat. \u201cIf one deserved suffering based on their father\u2019s actions alone, my life would\u2026 Well, I suppose it would look the same as it does now.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t be so dour, Severus. Despite your struggles, it seems that you\u2019ve moved far beyond the struggles of your youth. You\u2019re a brilliant Potions Master, you\u2019re free from Voldemort\u2019s control\u2014\u201d Severus flinched. \u201c\u2014and you seem to have made a connection with young Mr. Potter out there.\u201d</p>\n<p>Severus waved away that line of thought. \u201cWhat I\u2019m trying to say is that the boy has been suffering, and there\u2019s no reason to let it continue.\u201d When Dumbledore opened his mouth again, Severus pressed, \u201cNo blood bond will be worth it if the boy dies in their care. These situations escalate, especially if the abuser knows that no one will interfere.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI do not believe they would permanently harm him. They do fear me, if not as much as they perhaps should,\u201d Dumbledore said. \u201cYou must admit that Harry has grown into a spectacularly brave and selfless young man despite the circumstances of his childhood.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s brave because he doesn\u2019t think anyone will help if he asks. He\u2019s selfless because he\u2019s been taught that his life has no worth,\u201d Severus snarled.</p>\n<p>Dumbledore\u2019s shoulders slumped. \u201cWhat do you suggest then, Severus?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe needs somewhere safe to live. He can\u2019t go back to Petunia.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd where is this safe place?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe could stay at Hogwarts.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo few of us are there during the summer, that would be as good as asking the boy to live by himself. If I could take care of him, you know that I would, Severus. My duties involve far more travel and risk than reasonable, though, and I am an old man.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, Hogwarts wouldn\u2019t work,\u201d Severus agreed. \u201cAsk anyone in our world. Take out an ad in the newspaper and we\u2019d have a hundred applications by dawn.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAn entire list of people who want to have authority over the Boy-Who-Lived, who would treat him like a hero, and not a child.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe Weasleys would adopt him in a heartbeat. Don\u2019t forget, I\u2019ve met both Molly and Arthur. If their finances can\u2019t take it, ask anyone else from your Order. Don\u2019t pretend there aren\u2019t people you trust with this.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAh, but are there people <em>Harry</em> trusts?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat hasn\u2019t been your priority this far,\u201d Severus pointed out, but he took that to heart. The only reason Potter hadn\u2019t run away from Severus\u2019s house that summer was because the thought hadn\u2019t occurred to him. If he was with strangers in a house without wards, who could stop him from recklessly striking out on his own? Potter would need a firm hand, enough that he could trust his guardian to place and enforce rules that were for his own good, but someone subtle enough not to trigger the boy\u2019s fear. Severus narrowed his eyes. \u201cYou\u2019re trying to get me to volunteer.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI know better than to try to manipulate you, my boy,\u201d Dumbledore said. \u201cAnd moreover, despite your current rush of protectiveness, I do not see you happily agreeing to be Harry\u2019s guardian in the long term. For I fear that this placement will be for life. Harry\u2019s greatest tasks are yet ahead of him, and if we\u2019re going to tear him from his current home\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>Severus scoffed.</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2014we should be sure that the second placement is permanent. Leaving him floating between different guardians would likely be even worse for his wellbeing. Perhaps Dedalus would be willing to volunteer. He has a friendly demeanor.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou must be kidding,\u201d Severus said. \u201cDiggle would faint at the very idea. Potter doesn\u2019t need hero worship any more than he needed the abuse.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cArabella loves the boy, but she lives down the street from the Dursleys. I suppose if we erected the right wards\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe needs stability, not a madhouse.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI thought you had grown beyond your prejudice against Squibs,\u201d Dumbledore said coolly.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not her lack of magic I object to. It\u2019s the cats.\u201d</p>\n<p>Dumbledore tapped a finger to his chin. \u201cHagrid has always loved the boy.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHagrid is Hagrid. He wouldn\u2019t be able to maintain any level of discipline. Potter would be as ill-behaved as any of Hagrid\u2019s other charges within the year.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou see? It is not so easy as you said,\u201d Dumbledore said. \u201cWhy do you think I selected the Dursleys at first? Or sent him to you this summer? If there were an easy answer, I would have found it. Not to be arrogant, but there is rarely a solvable puzzle that I can\u2019t sort out, especially not after twelve years.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThen it seems we only have one option,\u201d Severus said. \u201cHe\u2019s staying with me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s not necessary,\u201d Dumbledore said.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou said it yourself. If that were easy to find, you\u2019d have saddled someone else with him this summer. But you didn\u2019t. There was only me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou understand that this is not a decision to make on a whim, or to prove something,\u201d Dumbledore said. \u201cHarry has an important future ahead of him.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou know I believe the Dark Lord will continue trying to return. Unlike you, I\u2019m not willing to leave his defeat in the hands of a thirteen-year-old simply because of a prophecy by that old bat. If he does return, I plan on doing all in my power to stop him. I\u2019ll make sure Potter can protect himself if he\u2019s targeted, but I won\u2019t usher him out the door to his doom. If that\u2019s what you\u2019re looking for\u2014and that is what the Dursleys would have done\u2014then maybe I\u2019m not the best choice in your eyes. But you\u2019d be wrong. He needs stability. He needs someone strong enough to protect him. I can do that.\u201d</p>\n<p>Dumbledore, to Severus\u2019s surprise, nodded. \u201cThen it\u2019s settled.\u201d</p>\n<p>The dual rush of panic and relief that crashed over Severus was nearly overwhelming, but he cleared his throat. \u201cThere is one <em>other</em> matter to discuss,\u201d he said silkily. \u201cThe matter of the Dursleys\u2019 punishment.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAh,\u201d Dumbledore said. \u201cThat, you will have to leave to me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut, sir\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo matter what you seem to believe, I do not take kindly to the abuse Vernon and Petunia committed under my watch. I was the one who placed Harry in their care, and it is up to me to provide\u2026feedback on their performance. I will not need assistance.\u201d</p>\n<p>There was an icy glint in Dumbledore\u2019s eye that Severus rarely saw, the one that betrayed the strength and cunning that was usually hidden behind a jovial mask. \u201cNo,\u201d Severus agreed thoughtfully. \u201cI suppose you won\u2019t.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"center\">#</p>\n<p>When Dumbledore and Snape emerged, Harry felt like a spring that had been compressed for years, just waiting to be released. He bolted to his feet, head rushing from the sudden movement.</p>\n<p>Dumbledore approached Harry, reaching for him, but stopped shy when Harry took a small step back. Harry realized he\u2019d been moving to put his hand on Harry\u2019s shoulder, and felt a shamed flush take over his cheeks. Dumbledore would never hurt him. He <em>knew</em> that. Why couldn\u2019t Harry just control his reactions?</p>\n<p>\u201cMy dear Harry,\u201d Dumbledore said. \u201cIt would seem I owe you an apology.\u201d Harry sent a quick glance at Snape, who was standing further back with a deliberately neutral expression. Dumbledore continued before Harry had to come up with a response. \u201cI do hope you\u2019ll forgive me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Harry said quickly. \u201cSure. I mean, of course, sir.\u201d Why was Dumbledore apologizing? For leaving him with the Dursleys? Or for letting him stay with Snape that summer?</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve only ever wanted the best for you, Harry. Unfortunately, even I make mistakes, and in this case, they have caused you suffering. And worse, you felt you could not tell me. That is my biggest regret of all.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry opened his mouth, but he couldn\u2019t find a response. He looked at Snape for guidance again. His professor just shrugged and gestured for Harry to turn his attention back to Dumbledore.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cGoing forward, please know that you can tell me anything, Harry. Not only that, but I expect to hear from you,\u201d Dumbledore said.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, sir,\u201d Harry said.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNow,\u201d Dumbledore said, straightening. \u201cYou must know that Severus and I have been discussing your future. Obviously, a return to the Dursleys would be untenable. You will not be returning to Little Whinging, not unless that\u2019s what you desire. Is that what you desire?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Harry said urgently. \u201cI don\u2019t want to go back.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHow was your summer with Severus? Would you also prefer not to stay here? At this point, school is about to start. You could come to the castle early, though I fear there would not be much in the way of entertainment. You can leave if that is what you want.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI,\u201d Harry faltered, looking for a third time at Snape.</p>\n<p>This time, Dumbledore shifted to block his line of sight. \u201cDo not fear to speak your mind, Harry.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t mind staying here.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d</p>\n<p>Feeling defensive, Harry said, \u201cThings have been good here. Snape cooked for me every day and helped me with my homework. He let me work in his garden, but also didn\u2019t care when I took a day to practice flying,\u201d Harry said. \u201cHe even took care of me when I was sick.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPotter, you know those are not supposed to be abnormal things,\u201d Snape drawled, but there was an unexpected hint of fondness in his exasperation.</p>\n<p>\u201cI like staying here,\u201d Harry told Dumbledore firmly.</p>\n<p>\u201cVery well. Then it\u2019s settled. Now, Harry, I must be off. It is getting late, though I suspect it is more trouble for my bedtime than yours. I\u2019ll see you at the start of term feast. Again, come to me whenever you need to talk. You know where to find me. The password this year is \u2018cauldron cake,\u2019\u201d Dumbledore said with a wink. Then, he tipped his hat and departed into the night.</p>\n<p>Severus closed the door behind him and waved his wand, presumably replacing the wards he let down to allow the Headmaster entrance to the house.</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course he leaves it to me,\u201d Snape grumbled quietly.</p>\n<p>Harry swallowed when Snape turned back to him. There was a strange blend of conflicting emotions on the professor\u2019s face, and Harry couldn\u2019t begin to guess what they meant.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to stay here,\u201d Snape said brusquely. \u201cNot if you don\u2019t want to. But if you do, you can.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry shrugged. \u201cI already told Dumbledore I\u2019d stay here for the rest of the summer.\u201d</p>\n<p>Snape just shook his head. \u201cSit down. We should talk.\u201d</p>\n<p>If it weren\u2019t for the fact that Snape also looked nervous, Harry would have been terrified. To his surprise, he found that he was less nervous than he would have expected. Normally when an adult in his life wanted a serious conversation with him, it was to scream at him, or tell him the story of his parents\u2019 murder, or to bully him into handing over the Sorcerer\u2019s Stone. Tonight, after everything Snape had already done for him, even Harry couldn\u2019t believe that he was about to yell at him.</p>\n<p>Snape had made the decision to call Dumbledore, had dragged the Headmaster away for a conversation, and had agreed to let Harry stay. He\u2019d looked out for Harry this far. He might be annoyed by Harry\u2019s reaction to the situation, about his unwillingness to help Snape start the conversation with Dumbledore. But even if he was mad, Harry was <em>safe</em> here.</p>\n<p>Harry perched on the edge of the couch, watching as Snape slumped into his armchair. Snape rubbed a hand over his forehead, and then said, \u201cYou might have guessed what I\u2019m about to ask you. And I am going to be <em>asking</em>, not telling. I don\u2019t imagine this would work without your cooperation. I\u2019ve seen your interactions with authority you\u2019re not interested in respecting.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSorry, sir?\u201d Harry asked, completely lost.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou need a new guardian. It seems I am the best candidate.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry took a moment to process that. \u201cYou mean\u2026permanently?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, Potter,\u201d Snape said with surprising patience. \u201cPermanently. You would come back here every summer until you\u2019re of legal age. I tend to stay at Hogwarts for Christmas and Easter, so you\u2019d either stay there with me or visit your friends at those times. As we discussed earlier, there would be some rules you\u2019d need to follow. Improving your handwriting would be at the top of that list. But, ah,\u201d Snape hesitated, \u201cI believe I can improve on the experience you had this summer, once we\u2019re on the same page. And I believe I would be an acceptable option. I know you\u2019re not fond of me, and that you might have someone else in mind, and I won\u2019t force the issue. This should be your choice.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou want to be my guardian,\u201d Harry repeated. There were a thousand questions in his mind, but all he could ask was: \u201c<em>Why</em>?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBecause you need a new guardian,\u201d Snape said.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d Harry said, slumping slightly. What had he expected? He had been nothing but trouble for Snape so far that summer. This was a request made from obligation. Dumbledore had probably forced him to make the offer.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd,\u201d Snape said, \u201cto everyone\u2019s surprise, I believe we may be a good fit. Having you here this summer was not quite as\u2026miserable as I expected. You\u2019re sharper than you show in class and you\u2019re motivated. It seems a shame that you have not been given the chance to reach your full potential.\u201d</p>\n<p>From anyone else, that would have all sounded like the faintest praise. From Snape, though, Harry felt like he was being awarded some high honor. Snape had basically just admitted to <em>liking</em> Harry.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need to decide tonight. Either way, rest assured that you will <em>never</em> go back to your aunt and uncle\u2019s house. That is in no way contingent on your response to me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe answer is yes,\u201d Harry blurted.</p>\n<p>Raising an eyebrow, Snape said, \u201cYou\u2019re so sure?\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry nodded. \u201cI\u2019m sure.\u201d</p>\n<p>For a moment, Snape seemed to be at a loss for words. Then, he nodded. \u201cI\u2019ll do my best to do this right,\u201d he said solemnly. \u201cNow, the Headmaster was right. It\u2019s getting late, and you\u2019ve had an active day, especially so soon after being ill. It\u2019s time for you to go to bed.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry considered protesting, wanting to hear more details about this new situation, but a yawn escaped him at the thought of getting some sleep. \u201cOkay,\u201d he said. He stood up and headed toward his room. He paused at the door. \u201cAnd, er, thank you, sir. For everything.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need to thank me, Pott\u2014Harry,\u201d Snape said. \u201cThis won\u2019t be easy,\u201d he added, as though needing to be sure Harry had thought through his answer.</p>\n<p>\u201cNothing is,\u201d Harry said wryly.</p>\n<p>That answer seemed to pain Snape, but he nodded. \u201cTogether, we\u2019ll see if we can change that. Sleep well, Harry.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry smiled, and went to bed.</p>"
