  "text": "<p>The first thing Stiles thinks when he opens the door is that it\u2019s not his birthday, but someone has sent him some kind of cop stripper. The guy is \u2014 god, he\u2019s <i>breathtakingly</i> hot, and Stiles is just not this lucky in life. When he moved back to Beacon Hills after college, he had resigned himself to basically not getting laid for the two years he planned to stay.</p>\n<p>Fortunately, Stiles just stares with his mouth open like a complete goober instead of voicing any of this.</p>\n<p>Then Mr. Cop Stripper actually tips his hat at Stiles and says politely, \u201cIs the Sheriff at home?\u201d</p>\n<p>Oh god oh god <i>real</i> cop, of course he\u2019s here to see Stiles\u2019 dad. \u201cOh, yeah, just \u2014 would you like to come in? He\u2019ll be right down.\u201d</p>\n<p>The guy looks at the door frame and then frowns at him. \u201cYou really shouldn\u2019t invite strangers into your home, you know.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles bristles at that. \u201cOh my god, seriously? I\u2019m not a kid, I promise you, but if you\u2019d like to condescend to me some more, feel free to stay on the porch.\u201d</p>\n<p>Of course Stiles\u2019 dad chooses that moment to come clattering down the stairs. \u201cDerek! You\u2019re a little early. Stiles, why did you leave him on the porch?\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles makes a face at him that he hopes appropriately conveys that <i>Derek</i> is on the porch because he\u2019s a jerk. A really, really hot jerk. \u201cWell, dad, you always told me not to open the door for people I don\u2019t know,\u201d Stiles says sweetly.</p>\n<p>His dad gives him a look. \u201cDerek, come on in. This is my son, Stiles. Stiles, this is Derek Hale, my new deputy.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPleased to meet you,\u201d Derek says, flashing Stiles a smile with too many teeth, and then takes one deliberate step inside.</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>Deputy Hale is an overnight sensation in Beacon Hills, which Stiles should have predicted. Most of the Hale family moved to a ranch an hour north about fifteen years ago, which means that the new deputy is rattling around the old Hale house in the woods by himself. The Hales have long roots in Beacon Hills, though, so just about everyone is falling all over themselves to make the prodigal son feel right at home again.</p>\n<p>Stiles remembers seeing Derek when he was a kid. It seemed like he was always with a bunch of his cousins, roaming around Beacon Hills in a pack \u2014 where there was one Hale kid, the others usually weren\u2019t too far behind. Once, when they were seven, Stiles and Scott both sneaked into Mr. Callahan\u2019s garage and took a bow and arrow from the wall and shot it into the woods, which was not the best plan because then they couldn\u2019t find the arrow. Stiles had been sick with anxiety while looking for it, just knowing they were going to be in the worst trouble when their parents found out \u2014 and they would, Stiles\u2019 mom always knew when he and Scott did something dumb.</p>\n<p>Derek had appeared out of nowhere and held out the missing arrow to Stiles, and told him to put it back where he found it and not to play with arrows anymore. Stiles promptly burst into tears and Derek had looked at him sort of awkwardly, and then walked them back to Mr. Callahan\u2019s to give the bow and arrow back. Stiles got a stern lecture from his dad, no dessert for two weeks, <i>and</i> he had to apologize again to Mr. Callahan, who probably never even would have known that he\u2019d been missing anything in the first place if Derek hadn\u2019t hauled him and Scott to his front door.</p>\n<p>Not that Stiles is carrying any grudges from when he was seven years old, or anything.</p>\n<p>\u201cStiles, I thought I\u2019d invite Derek over for dinner on Sunday,\u201d his dad says a few days after Derek showed up on their porch for the first time.</p>\n<p>\u201cHave fun with that,\u201d Stiles says, not looking away from the spreadsheet he\u2019s working on.</p>\n<p>\u201cLet me rephrase \u2014 sons who are living rent-free with their parental units after graduating from college should make dinner,\u201d his dad says dryly.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou could order something,\u201d Stiles says. \u201cAnd it\u2019s only for two years, this is not indefinite. This is a very time-sensitive and fiscally responsible arrangement for the paying off of student loans, remember?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDerek\u2019s family is all up north, now. He eats Hot Pockets for lunch.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles twitches.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd sometimes those burritos from 7-Eleven,\u201d his dad continues relentlessly.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s going to get <i>scurvy</i>,\u201d Stiles moans. \u201cAll right, all right, invite him over for dinner, if only because I know you don\u2019t want to find a new deputy next week if this one collapses of malnutrition before then.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re all heart,\u201d his dad says, and claps him on the shoulder.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, yeah,\u201d Stiles says, waving him away, and goes back to the project for his client.</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>Everywhere Stiles goes for the rest of the week, it\u2019s all, \u201cHave you met Deputy Hale?\u201d It\u2019s asked in varying tones of voice, from appreciative coo to sister-get-a-load-of-that. It\u2019s not like Stiles is disputing the fact that Deputy Hale\u2019s uniform fits him exceptionally well. But well-fitting uniforms do not make up for douchebaggery, a maxim Stiles has tried to live by but maybe kind of fails at eighty percent of the time, although he maintains it\u2019s not his fault that college rugby boys are so sexually flexible.</p>\n<p>Deputy Hale has given Mrs. Perkins a warning and two speeding tickets this week alone, and where one lady cougar leads, the rest follow. Stiles hopes Beacon Hills does something worthwhile with the impending windfall.</p>\n<p>But soon enough, it\u2019s Sunday, and since his dad is coming off shift just before dinner, and Derek will go on duty shortly afterward, Stiles can make dinner without any editorial comments and maybe dance around the kitchen a little. So of course, when Stiles and the Spice Girls are demanding to know what you want, what you really really want, he turns around to see Derek Hale watching from the doorway to the kitchen like the complete creeper he is.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh my god, learn how to <i>knock</i>,\u201d Stiles says, while he tries to figure out if he can die of mortification and get the casserole out of the oven at the same time. </p>\n<p>\u201cI did knock,\u201d Derek says, like he\u2019s being totally reasonable, which he\u2019s not \u2014 also, he\u2019s at least twenty minutes early and Stiles wants to smack that smirk right off his stupidly gorgeous face. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t hear me over the music.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles mutes it and pulls the baking dish out of the oven, and whoa, Derek is all right up in his space and sniffing the casserole from over Stiles\u2019 shoulder.</p>\n<p>\u201cSmells good,\u201d Derek says, although what does he know, he apparently thinks food that comes in plastic sleeves is perfectly acceptable. Which is not to say that Stiles\u2019 cooking is amazing or anything \u2014 he basically taught himself via YouTube after his mom passed away. Still, he\u2019s been feeding himself and his dad for more than a few years, now, and while he\u2019s never going to win any awards for presentation, nobody goes away hungry or regretting it. Tonight is a variant of a Tex-Mex casserole that he\u2019d perfected back when he and Scott were both going through major growth spurts and having almost daily lacrosse practice \u2014 which is to say, there should be enough to feed a small army.</p>\n<p>As it turns out \u2014 small army, yes. Deputy Hale, no.</p>\n<p>Stiles offers Derek seconds, and then thirds, and then Derek spends the rest of dinner manfully pretending that he\u2019s not interested in decimating the remainder of the casserole. So Stiles puts the leftovers in a plastic container and shoves it in Derek\u2019s hands when he sees him out the door.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t have to,\u201d Derek says eventually, clearly having unearthed manners from somewhere but not really winning any points for persuasive acting.</p>\n<p>\u201cBetter you than me,\u201d Stiles says. \u201cI\u2019ve got enough junk in my trunk.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek looks at him like he\u2019s an alien.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to be late for your shift,\u201d Stiles says, and shoos him in the direction of the patrol car.</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>When Stiles can\u2019t take staring at the same four walls while he\u2019s doing kickass contract work, he packs it up for the coffee shop, which is of course a national chain and trying way too hard, but whatever, it gets him out of the house and there\u2019s caffeine. And sometimes if he\u2019s stuck, the change of scenery can really work wonders.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s one of those times, so Stiles is typing away like a crazy person and mainlining coffee and completely tuning out everything else, so much so that he almost jumps out of his skin when he realizes someone is standing right behind him.</p>\n<p>Derek is in uniform \u2014 when is he not, it\u2019s like he\u2019s constantly on duty \u2014 and leans over to pick up Stiles\u2019 cup. He sniffs it once, swirls the coffee around a bit, and then takes a sip, like that is normal and not completely fucking rude, what the hell.</p>\n<p>\u201cI could have the plague, for all you know,\u201d Stiles says, leaning back in his chair to look up at Derek.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou don\u2019t,\u201d Derek says confidently, and then takes another sip. \u201cThis is terrible.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWow, crazy, but guess what \u2014 if you don\u2019t like it, don\u2019t drink it, and oh wait! \u2014 that\u2019s <i>my</i> coffee, so don\u2019t drink it anyway,\u201d Stiles snipes.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou really shouldn\u2019t drink any more today. You won\u2019t be able to sleep.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI will sleep just fine, because I will have finished this project and made more in six hours than you make in a week,\u201d Stiles says, and stabs viciously at his keyboard.</p>\n<p>Derek, who is obviously a freak, braces himself on the table with his arms on either side of Stiles, and leans down to look at his laptop screen. It puts his nose sort of behind Stiles\u2019 ear, which is definitely not okay because his breath is stirring Stiles\u2019 hair a little, and also when he speaks, it\u2019s directly in Stiles\u2019 ear. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNothing you would understand,\u201d Stile says, and resolutely keeps typing. \u201cAlso, I\u2019m working. Aren\u2019t you supposed to be working, too?\u201d</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a huff of air across Stiles\u2019 ear and he can\u2019t help the shiver that runs through him. Stiles has extremely sensitive ears, which is normally fine with him but obviously it\u2019s not so convenient when deputies are breathing all hot and heavy around him. \u201cAll right, then,\u201d Derek says, sounding amused.</p>\n<p>It takes Stiles about ten minutes to realize that Derek stole his coffee on his way out.</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>Derek starts coming around the house an awful lot, although this seems to be mostly related to a series of weird accidents where people are getting mauled by an as-yet unidentified animal. Of course, Stiles\u2019 dad and Derek mostly sit at the kitchen table and look through case files without talking about any identifying details in Stiles\u2019 earshot, but come on, he\u2019s not an idiot, and he can put a few things together. One, the accidents seems to be pretty regular, and Stiles really can\u2019t stop himself from multitasking while coding and thus links up the dates in question to the lunar cycle. Two, strange things are afoot at the Circle K, because none of the victims can give a coherent statement about their attack, which suggests some kind of drug. Or maybe a cult. Except he has a hard time thinking Mr. Carson is in a cult, because he\u2019s always writing these impassioned and well-argued letters to the newspaper editor, and if he\u2019s crazy about anything, it\u2019s about sustainability practices and composting.</p>\n<p>The attacks started about two months before Derek came to Beacon Hills, and it\u2019s been on the back burner for lack of new evidence, but Derek seems super serious and asks some good questions when Stiles\u2019 dad brings him up to speed. At least, Stiles thinks they\u2019re good questions, because his dad always seems a little surprised that Derek might actually be competent at his job. Then again \u2014 the last deputy wasn\u2019t overly blessed with problem-solving skills, or social skills, or any skills, really.</p>\n<p>Stiles sees Derek to the door that night, in what is almost becoming a tradition that he doesn\u2019t want to talk about \u2014 namely, he keeps cooking for at least five people, and gives the leftovers to Derek on the unspoken condition that neither of them acknowledge it in any way.</p>\n<p>\u201cStiles,\u201d Derek says, his breath curling in the cold air. He\u2019s clutching a tupperware with an egregious amount of leftover lasagna to his chest. \u201cStay home tonight.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles rolls his eyes. \u201cLook, I\u2019m a social butterfly and I can\u2019t be tamed, but there\u2019s really nothing to do around here. I\u2019m going to watch reruns of Mythbusters with my dad.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Derek says, sounding satisfied. He takes a step backwards, then turns to go.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s because it\u2019s a full moon, right?\u201d Stiles blurts out.</p>\n<p>Derek\u2019s head whips around and he stares at Stiles hard.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou think I\u2019m going to get nibbled on by a coyote?\u201d Stiles says jokingly, except that Derek\u2019s reaction is making him a lot more worried than he was a minute ago.</p>\n<p>Derek is back up the porch and in Stiles\u2019 space so, so fast. He ducks his head down to look Stiles in the eyes. \u201cStay here. Promise me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy should I promise you anything?\u201d Stiles says, and then licks his lips nervously.</p>\n<p>Derek\u2019s not even touching him, but he\u2019s standing so close that it feels like super inappropriate city, population: them. Derek breaks eye contact to lean closer still and growl, \u201c<i>Stiles</i>,\u201d in his ear.</p>\n<p>\u201cAll right,\u201d Stiles says quickly. \u201cStaying home. This is me promising.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGood,\u201d Derek says, and waits for Stiles to shut himself back inside the house and turn the locks before heading back to the patrol car.</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>The thing is, Derek should seriously know better if he\u2019s talked to Stiles\u2019 dad at all. Stiles promising not to do something is basically like a blood pact that he will. Not always on purpose, either.</p>\n<p>In his defense, he\u2019s just going to the store to pick up some eggs, because a dozen seriously isn\u2019t enough for the pre-shift breakfast he is going to have to make tomorrow morning. And probably another package of turkey bacon isn\u2019t a bad idea. He\u2019s expecting to run into a few people he knows, because it\u2019s Beacon Hills and you can\u2019t avoid it.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s not expecting the wolf.</p>\n<p>At least, he\u2019s pretty sure it\u2019s a wolf, and not a coyote. The coyotes are part of a repopulation project that Stiles finds fascinating, but most of them have radio collars and also really don\u2019t go out of their way to say hi to people.</p>\n<p>This thing definitely wants to say hi to Stiles, or so he deduces by the way it approaches him, winding its way across the brush to his jeep. Oh god, he thinks, it probably has rabies, he is going to get bitten by a rabid wolf, and he\u2019s going to die and also it will probably set back wolf conservation efforts a lot.</p>\n<p>And then something weird happens. The wolf gets close enough and sniffs the air around Stiles, and half circles Stiles before letting out a mournful whine and trotting away back into the forest. Stiles does not drop his groceries, but he does sit in his jeep for ten minutes while he waits for the adrenaline to subside. He drives home and puts the groceries away, but his dad is conked out on the couch during the Colbert Report and he doesn\u2019t really want to wake him up to tell him about his near impression of Steve Irwin, minus the stingray but plus a wolf.</p>\n<p>He hauls himself out of bed when he hears his dad\u2019s alarm go off early the next morning, stumbling down the stairs in an old t-shirt and pajama pants that have his alma mater\u2019s name across the ass. He\u2019s just starting on the turkey bacon when the front door opens \u2014 Stiles\u2019 dad had some sort of episode a few weeks ago because he gave Derek a spare set of keys \u2014 and Derek wanders into the kitchen, giving Stiles something that might be charitably described as a smile if you sort of squinted and were willing to give credit for minimal effort.</p>\n<p>\u201cMorning,\u201d Stiles says, brain still not quite online. He yawns and scratches his belly a little before he pokes the bacon with a spatula.</p>\n<p>\u201cMorning,\u201d Derek says, and he looks a little peaky, like maybe he didn\u2019t sleep much, but his uniform is clean and unwrinkled and still fits him obnoxiously well.</p>\n<p>Pre-shift breakfast is something that\u2019s happened a few times now, and it feels pretty comfortable and maybe even a little cozy with the dawn light streaming into the kitchen. Which is probably why what happens next is that much more shocking. It seems to happen so fast \u2014 one minute, Stiles is taking the bacon off the heat, and thinking about how many eggs to scramble for breakfast burritos, and then Derek is backing him up against the counter and saying roughly, \u201cI told you not to go out last night.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHow did you\u2014\u201d Stiles begins and then just stops talking when Derek actually rests his head in the crook of Stiles\u2019 shoulder, which is obviously <i>weird</i> but Derek seems to be close to shaking, and that\u2019s so alarming that Stiles finds himself bringing up his hands to grip Derek by the shoulders. \u201cOkay, but I mean, I just went to the store, and there was this wolf but I don\u2019t think it had rabies\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek makes a noise in his throat that sounds really fucking distressed, and Stiles seriously does not know what his deal is, but he\u2019s obviously pretty upset and the last thing Stiles ever wants is to make people worry about him. \u201cI\u2019m okay,\u201d Stiles whispers.</p>\n<p>Derek has avoided touching him so far, but he grips Stiles\u2019 nape then, and turns his face more fully into Stiles\u2019 neck, and \u2014 no, still seriously weird, but it\u2019s kind of \u2014 kind of \u2014</p>\n<p>Derek breathes against Stiles\u2019 skin, and Stiles is nearly breathing with him, at least until he realizes that is Derek\u2019s tongue licking up the tendon of his neck, and when Stiles\u2019 breath stutters to a halt, Derek gives him the messiest, <i>meanest</i> hickey Stiles has been the recipient of since basically ever, and all Stiles can do is scrabble at Derek\u2019s shoulders and make a weak noise because it hurts in the best way.</p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t know what would have happened next because Derek is pulling away and then Stiles hears his dad start to come down the stairs, and shit shit shit \u2014 he throws a dish towel over his shoulder, hoping it hides the worst of the damage, and Derek is still looking at him like he wants to have a go on the other side of Stiles\u2019 neck, and jesus, the thing is \u2014 Stiles would probably let him, and that definitely has to be weird, they haven\u2019t even kissed and Stiles just let a deputy police officer maul him in his kitchen.</p>\n<p>Stiles\u2019 dad doesn\u2019t say anything, but to be honest \u2014 his investigative powers aren\u2019t the best until his second cup of coffee.</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>There\u2019s no way Stiles can stay in the house after breakfast \u2014 he feels like he\u2019s going to vibrate out of his chair, and if he\u2019s going to get any work done today, it\u2019s not going to be in the same room as the proverbial scene of the crime.</p>\n<p>Which is too bad, because Stiles actually really likes working at the kitchen table. But he packs it up for the coffee shop, and thanks all available weather deities that it\u2019s well past cold enough to wear a scarf without looking like a douche. He actually gets some work accomplished, after meandering around Wikipedia and reading about wolves in a bid to let his brain wrestle with a thorny bit of coding and come up with a solution. It works, and thus Stiles has both triumphed over a project roadblock and learned more about wolves in his neck of the woods. None of it really explains a wolf trotting up to see him, and Stiles is even more convinced that it wasn\u2019t rabid. And it really doesn\u2019t explain Derek\u2019s weirdness, or how he knew that Stiles went out when he said he wouldn\u2019t \u2014 although, in his defense, he didn\u2019t really think he was going to encounter any wild animals at the grocery store. Probably Derek drove by and saw his jeep in the parking lot, or maybe somebody mentioned seeing him. Stiles knows from experience that there\u2019s a metric ton of gossiping that goes on at the station under the guise of keeping an eye on things in town.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s still light out when Stiles leaves for home. He can\u2019t deny it \u2014 he\u2019s a little spooked. Everything in him says he should get home before it gets dark. So of course his jeep, being the ancient, recalcitrant beast that it is, dies on the side of the road. It\u2019s getting darker every second, and when he calls his dad, he gets his voicemail \u2014 and shit, his dad has that county board thing tonight.</p>\n<p>Stiles pops the hood and looks at the engine in a desultory fashion, still wrestling with the sudden, strange realization that he can\u2019t call any of his old friends to pick him up, that nobody\u2019s <i>here</i> in Beacon Hills anymore, when a police cruiser pulls up and Stiles heaves a sigh of relief.</p>\n<p>And then just as quickly feels his heart start to race, because of course it\u2019s Derek.</p>\n<p>\u201cUh, hey,\u201d Stiles says, rocking back on his heels</p>\n<p>\u201cBattery die?\u201d Derek asks, maglite firm in his grip, and now is really not the time to be thinking about how comfortable Derek looks with his hand wrapped around a stick.</p>\n<p>Stiles sighs heavily and scowls at the innards of the jeep. \u201cIt\u2019s probably something far more fatal than that. I was really hoping to get through the next two years with this, but I\u2019d probably have to put more work into it than it\u2019s worth.\u201d He shivers a little, because it was chilly before the sun started to go down, and now it\u2019s downright cold, and his hipster scarf isn\u2019t really cutting it.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou can call a tow in the morning,\u201d Derek says. He shines a light on the engine and his brow, already perpetually furrowed, furrows further. \u201cI can take a look at it if you want.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou know stuff about cars?\u201d Stiles says skeptically.</p>\n<p>Derek\u2019s mouth twitches. \u201cMy family\u2019s ranch up north is pretty isolated. We do a lot of things ourselves, if we can \u2014 and I\u2019ve lost track of how many junk heaps my sister Laura has brought home to fix up.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles can\u2019t hide a smile, because it\u2019s not like cool, collected Deputy Hale is overly forthcoming with the heartwarming family stories, or any personal information at all, really. It\u2019s almost charming.</p>\n<p>Derek shuts the jeep\u2019s hood, then, and doesn\u2019t so much lead Stiles back to the cruiser as actively herd him toward it. He also turns the heat way up, for which Stiles is more than a little thankful. He finds himself loosening his scarf after a few minutes, though.</p>\n<p>Derek pulls the cruiser into Stiles\u2019 driveway and puts the car in park. \u201cYou should have called me when your car died,\u201d Derek says, looking straight ahead at Stiles\u2019 front door.</p>\n<p>Stiles does not rub the hickey that has to be perfectly visible to Derek right now, even though it seems to be throbbing slightly. \u201cLook,\u201d Stiles says awkwardly. \u201cJust because you\u2019re my dad\u2019s deputy doesn\u2019t mean I can just call you when you\u2019re on duty to bail me out of trouble.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek\u2019s hands clench around the steering wheel, and he turns to look at Stiles. \u201cI want you to call me,\u201d he says.</p>\n<p>Stiles licks his lips. \u201cYeah, okay, next time my jeep dies, you\u2019re on my speed-dial. Although I expect it to be dead-dead and not in the process of dying again for the next however many weeks, so it\u2019s probably not going to happen any time soon.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek actually makes a noise in his throat that Stiles might classify as a growl, and his eyes \u2014 man, were they always that blue? The light\u2019s got to be reflecting off them weird or something. \u201cI\u2019ll walk you to the door,\u201d Derek says, and kills the engine.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s less than ten feet to the porch, but Stiles has grown up around cops, and has long since stopped objecting when they escort him places. A good portion of his childhood involved being hauled around by the scruff by various officers, but what can Stiles say, he was a curious child and if you will leave said child to occupy himself while in a police station, you probably shouldn\u2019t be too surprised when he decides to go exploring and ends up halfway to the morgue or talking to the that one guy who\u2019s always eating Cheetos.</p>\n<p>Stiles digs his keys out of his pocket and pauses with his hand on the screen door. \u201cListen,\u201d he says, because Derek probably thinks it\u2019s part of his job, but that doesn\u2019t change that it nice of him to do. \u201cThanks for the ride.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek doesn\u2019t say anything, or even give him some sort of bro nod. What he does do is lean forward a little and breathe in through his nose, and Stiles has half a moment of wondering if he smells like the scones they were baking in the coffee shop, before Derek presses him up against the door and is nosing along his jawline before breathing warm air over the monster hickey on Stiles\u2019 neck.</p>\n<p>\u201cUm,\u201d Stiles manages to say, because this is sort of hot and extremely weird all at once, and it\u2019s probably not normal to get hard over a guy <i>sniffing</i> you, what is that, even. He\u2019s going to google this when Derek isn\u2019t busy holding Stiles\u2019 hips and oh god, moving his face to the other side of Stiles\u2019 neck, and what the hell, they haven\u2019t even kissed yet, and Stiles can put one hickey down to some kind of weird sleep-deprived, adrenaline-fueled freak out, but two is definitely, definitely\u2014</p>\n<p>Stiles makes a terribly unmanly mewling noise when Derek scrapes his teeth over Stiles\u2019 neck, and Derek must like that sound \u2014 he must like it a lot, because that growl is back and he puts one leg between Stiles\u2019 thighs, and oh god, there\u2019s no hiding the evidence that Stiles is turned on now, not that Derek seems to object because he is rocking his thigh up and licking Stiles\u2019 skin, and it\u2019s only when Stiles puts together that he has his fingers fisted in the embroidered Beacon Hills PD badge on Derek\u2019s shirt that he realizes what they are doing on the sheriff\u2019s porch. \u201cDerek,\u201d he whimpers. \u201cCome on, you\u2019re going to have to arrest yourself for \u2014 for something, lewd behavior, is this lewd behavior?\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek doesn\u2019t step back immediately, but he does stop molesting Stiles\u2019 neck and removes his leg so that Stiles is no longer riding his thigh. His breathing evens out, and then he pulls back enough to look at Stiles\u2019 face. He looks \u2014 well, he looks sort of uncomfortable, like he can\u2019t quite believe he just did that, but to be fair, Stiles can\u2019t quite believe he just did that, either.</p>\n<p>Oh god, please let Stiles not be Derek\u2019s first turn around the rainbow maypole, he was over that during his first semester in college and has no desire to revisit it. Stiles figures this is his cue to get inside and let the extreme awkwardness commence, or continue, really. He unlocks the door and steps inside, and Derek says, \u201cI mean it. I want you to call me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Stiles says, and swallows. \u201cSure thing. Night, Derek.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek stares at him for a minute, and then leaves without another word.</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>Google is not helpful. At first Stiles takes some heart in the fact that he\u2019s not the first person to pose the query, \u201cWhat does it mean when a guy sniffs you?\u201d But the answers are all terrible and mostly about shampoo, with a side order of Stiles really didn\u2019t want to know that ever, thanks.</p>\n<p>In the middle of the night, Stiles is jerked out of sleep, and it takes him a minute to realize that his dad didn\u2019t leave the television on \u2014 that\u2019s a dog howling outside. Stiles rubs his eyes and goes to his bedroom window to look. The moon is still new, but there\u2019s enough light pollution that Stiles can make out a shape at the edge of their property.</p>\n<p>That\u2019s no dog, and no coyote, either. It\u2019s a wolf, and it\u2019s baying at the night sky and it looks like it\u2019s staring straight at Stiles\u2019 window.</p>\n<p>His heart is hammering, and he\u2019s fumbling for his phone on his nightstand, only to wonder what he thinks he\u2019s going to do. Call animal control? The old veterinarian he knows?</p>\n<p>His thumb hovers over Derek\u2019s name in his contacts list. It\u2019s listed under \u201cDeputy Hale\u201d \u2014 it\u2019s probably his work cell phone number, and it\u2019s the middle of the night, and so what \u2014 so what if there\u2019s a wolf outside. It can\u2019t get to him. There\u2019s no reason to freak out. Just because his dad\u2019s working an overnight and he\u2019s alone in the house, there\u2019s absolutely no reason to panic.</p>\n<p>In the end, he goes back to bed, hand clutching his phone, and stares at the ceiling until he falls asleep.</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>He calls a tow when he wakes up the next morning, and wonders whether he should have them put it in the garage or leave it on the side of the driveway. It\u2019s going to be in his dad\u2019s way in either case, so he has half an idea to see how mushy the ground is and if he could just have them leave it in the side yard.</p>\n<p>But when he opens the front door, there\u2019s a dead body on the steps up to the porch.</p>\n<p>He makes a strangled noise, slams the door shut and locks it, and takes his phone with shaking fingers and he doesn\u2019t say hello, he just babbles out, \u201cOh my god, Derek, there\u2019s a dead person on my porch, okay like half a dead person, I don\u2019t think there are any legs, <i>Derek</i>\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cStiles,\u201d Derek says, his voice the kind of controlled and calm that Stiles knows they train into police officers. \u201cAre you inside the house?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d Stiles says, voice still wobbly, because that was a lot of blood, and cold dead eyes, and oh god, has it been on his porch all night?</p>\n<p>\u201cStiles, I want you to lock the door and <i>stay put</i>,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ll be right there.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh my god,\u201d Stiles says, scrubbing weakly at his face. \u201cI think I\u2019m going to be sick.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI need you to take some deep breaths,\u201d Derek says. \u201cI\u2019m on my way, okay? I\u2019m putting you on speaker, and you\u2019re going to talk to me until I get there.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTalk to you,\u201d Stiles repeats blankly. He sinks to the floor, his back to the front door like that will help keep it closed, like it will change the part where there is half a corpse less than ten feet from him and somebody must have put it there, was it dismembered before they left it on his porch, or \u2014</p>\n<p>\u201cStiles, I said talk, not hyperventilate,\u201d Derek says.</p>\n<p>\u201cI can\u2019t think of anything!\u201d Stiles protests miserably. \u201cI know, I know, usually I don\u2019t shut up but usually there aren\u2019t dead people on my porch.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek is quiet for a moment, and then says, \u201cTell me about lacrosse.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles boggles at his phone. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLacrosse. You played it in high school, right?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHuh? Yeah, I mean, I guess. I wasn\u2019t great. Still better than my best friend Scott, though, not that that\u2019s saying much since he had real bad asthma. I was a little klutzy in high school, not so good with the coordinated physical activity thing.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut you liked it,\u201d Derek prompts.</p>\n<p>\u201cUm, yeah? I mean, it sort of helped burn off some energy, I don\u2019t know if you know this, but my ADD was like six billion times worse in high school, and running around helped me focus a little. Well, that and a lot of Adderall.\u201d</p>\n<p>He hears Derek make a huffing noise at that. \u201cThere\u2019s a picture of you in your uniform in the hallway. You look like you\u2019re having fun.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles looks up, and he can just see the picture of him from where he\u2019s sitting. His hair was buzzed short back then, and he\u2019s grinning madly at the camera. His dad took the picture the night Stiles played first string for the very first time. They\u2019d still been so broken back then, a gaping mom-shaped hole in their lives, and that picture represented one of the few bright spots, a moment that Stiles could point to and say that at that moment, he\u2019d been pretty happy.</p>\n<p>But thinking of his mom brings him back to his very current problem on the porch. \u201cTell me you\u2019re almost here,\u201d Stiles says plaintively.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m turning on to your street. There\u2019s another officer behind me. Stay right where you are, Stiles.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Stiles says, clutching the phone even tighter. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p>\n<p>The next minutes are full of sirens and flashing lights, and Derek saying through the door, \u201cCome on, Stiles, I need you to move back so I can open the door, okay?\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles somehow hoists himself up on his feet, undoes the lock, and then Derek is gently pushing the door open and blocking Stiles\u2019 view of the porch, and he\u2019s wrapping his arms around Stiles and guiding his Stiles\u2019 face into his shoulder, and whispering, \u201cYou\u2019re all right. You\u2019re okay.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles just hides his face against Derek\u2019s uniform and they stand there in the entryway, Derek holding him tight, and Stiles doesn\u2019t know why he\u2019s shaking but he is. He doesn\u2019t know how long they stand there, just that it\u2019s until Stiles can hear his dad\u2019s panicked voice calling his name.</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>He\u2019s still trembling a little when Derek leads him out the back door and puts him in the police cruiser. On his dad\u2019s instructions, Derek is taking him down to the station to get his statement, even though Stiles knows it\u2019s really to get him out of the house so they can secure the scene.</p>\n<p>Derek\u2019s desk is crazy immaculate for a cop\u2019s desk \u2014 by comparison, the Sheriff\u2019s desk always looks like a paperwork hurricane hit it. Which isn\u2019t to say that Derek doesn\u2019t have files and papers, but they seem to be neatly organized, and the \u201cDeputy Hale\u201d of his nameplate is unobscured by dust and dirt.</p>\n<p>Derek gently pushes Stiles down into the chair next to his desk, and says, \u201cCan I get you something to drink?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI \u2014 what?\u201d Stiles blinks up at him.</p>\n<p>\u201cWater, not coffee,\u201d Derek says decisively, and returns with a cup that he presses into Stiles\u2019 hands. \u201cDrink that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI need coffee,\u201d Stiles says, but drinks the water anyway. \u201cI didn\u2019t sleep well last night.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy\u2019s that?\u201d Derek says, and it takes Stiles a second to realize that yeah, his neck is bare and Derek is staring at it. Derek meets his eyes, then, and he looks a little \u2014 well, a little guilty.</p>\n<p>\u201cNot because of that!\u201d Stiles hastens to say. \u201cI mean, not because of that thing where you \u2014 you. I got woken up in the middle of the night. I thought it was a dog howling? But I\u2019m pretty sure it was a wolf.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<i>What</i>,\u201d Derek says flatly.</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if it was the same one from the other night \u2014 but maybe, I don\u2019t know, how big is the wolf population of Beacon Hills, anyway?\u201d Stiles says, well aware that he\u2019s babbling but unable to rein it in.</p>\n<p>\u201cNot that big,\u201d Derek says darkly, and he looks <i>pissed</i>. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you call me?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSeriously?\u201d Stiles says. \u201cThe wolf was outside, what were you going to do about it? Also it was at least two a.m., weren\u2019t you sleeping or something?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI would have answered, no matter when you called,\u201d Derek says, looking really, really serious.</p>\n<p>Stiles knows his mouth is open, and he really should shut it, but that\u2019s \u2014 that\u2019s something guys usually don\u2019t say, especially not to Stiles. \u201cBecause you\u2019re an officer of the law?\u201d Stiles hazards.</p>\n<p>Derek stares at him. \u201cNo,\u201d he says slowly. \u201cBecause it\u2019s you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles takes a long minute to process that, and to cut himself some slack, he\u2019s had a long, eventful morning already. \u201cOh my god,\u201d Stiles says, jaw dropping. \u201cOh my god, are we like \u2014 are we dating?\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek makes a low noise of complete, utter frustration.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t even kissed me!\u201d Stiles protests in an urgent whisper. </p>\n<p>Derek closes his eyes for a moment, and then says, \u201cI\u2019m going to take your statement, now. And when we\u2019re not in my place of employment, I\u2019m going to fix that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cReally?\u201d Stiles marvels.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m going to fix it a lot,\u201d Derek promises him, and the look Derek pins him with makes him swallow. \u201cNow, start from the beginning.\u201d</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>By early afternoon, Stiles is almost swaying from exhaustion, due both to a terrible night\u2019s sleep and the events of the morning.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou can\u2019t go home yet,\u201d Derek says, sounding almost apologetic. \u201cI can take you back to my place.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles raises both eyebrows.</p>\n<p>\u201cTo sleep,\u201d Derek clarifies stiffly. \u201cYou could use some rest.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles is still feeling mystified by Derek\u2019s conception of dating, and is almost tempted to ask if the Hale ranch is in fact a cover for some sort of weird cult, but his curiosity at seeing Derek\u2019s old family home, not to mention his basic investment in getting laid with Derek at some point, wins out. He keeps his mouth shut and nods obediently.</p>\n<p>The Hale house is set back in the woods on quite a bit of land, and the house itself is way bigger than Stiles had imagined. When Derek unlocks the door, Stiles is pleasantly surprised by how bright and open it is, considering its age.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis way,\u201d Derek says, and leads him down the hallway. \u201cI\u2019m actually only occupying the first floor \u2014 I\u2019ve still got the upstairs and the basement closed off. Not really worth it to heat the whole house just for me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m getting that,\u201d Stiles says. They pass a door to a cavernous family room on his left before Derek halts outside a more modest bedroom that he\u2019s clearly been sleeping in, if the uniforms in the open wardrobe are any indication.</p>\n<p>Derek goes to the dresser and fishes out a shirt and throws it to Stiles. It\u2019s worn and soft and bears the name of the county police academy. \u201cI thought you\u2019d like to change into something different to sleep in,\u201d Derek says after a moment, like he\u2019s expecting Stiles to refuse.</p>\n<p>\u201cThanks,\u201d Stiles says, then swiftly strips out of his shirt \u2014 which is admittedly a little rank after Stiles basically fear-sweated through it \u2014 and pulls Derek\u2019s on.</p>\n<p>Derek\u2019s bed is a nest of quilts, some serious old-fashioned hand-sewn business, the kind that get passed down in families. There\u2019s one on the back of the Stilinksi couch that\u2019s ratty and coming apart and Stiles will never get rid of it, because it\u2019s warm and he has a whole childhood worth of memories attached to it. Stiles feels a little awkward, climbing into Derek\u2019s bed without Derek, but the sheets are soft and his exhaustion seems to really hit him as soon as he\u2019s wiggled into a comfortable position. \u201cYou going to tuck me in?\u201d he asks Derek.</p>\n<p>He thinks Derek is going to give him a look, but instead Derek sits down on the edge of the bed, and adjusts the quilts around his shoulders. It\u2019s \u2014 unexpected, and nice, and something else that just makes Stiles feel warm inside. And then Derek bends further down, and kisses him. It\u2019s slow, and heartbreakingly sweet, like Derek just wants to take all the time in the world to kiss Stiles, just for the sake of kissing him. And when he breaks the kiss, he nuzzles gently at Stiles\u2019 throat, over one of his massive love bites. \u201cGo to sleep,\u201d Derek murmurs.</p>\n<p>Stiles\u2019 eyes are already sliding shut. \u201cYou\u2019ll be around, right? You\u2019re not going to leave?\u201d he says.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll be right here. Go to sleep.\u201d</p>\n<p>And Stiles does.</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>He wakes up to the smell of eggs frying, and rubs his nose in the pillow under his cheek, and when he breathes in, it smells like Derek.</p>\n<p>His eyes fly open, and he remembers that it smells like Derek because he\u2019s in Derek\u2019s bed, wearing Derek\u2019s shirt, and wow, the sun has already gone down. He must have slept the afternoon away. When he pads out to the kitchen, Derek is wearing his uniform pants and an undershirt and poking at a frying pan with a spatula.</p>\n<p>\u201cUm, hi,\u201d Stiles says, and he\u2019s not sure what the rules are here \u2014 he\u2019s never really done the morning after thing when nothing happened. And even when he does do the morning after thing, he\u2019s only once woken up to the dude in question actually using the stove to make anything at all.</p>\n<p>Derek appears to be narrowly avoiding burning said eggs entirely, which means the yolk is going to be way more done that Stiles prefers, but he\u2019ll live. There\u2019s also a suspicious, lone piece of toast on a plate on the counter. Stiles wonders morbidly if this represents the sum total of the contents of Derek\u2019s fridge, which \u2014 considering Derek\u2019s appetite when Stiles cooks, probably.</p>\n<p>\u201cYour dad called while you were asleep,\u201d Derek says, divvying up the eggs between an empty plate and plate-with-solitary-toast before pushing the latter in Stiles\u2019 direction. \u201cI have to go back to the station for a bit. Want to ride along?\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles\u2019 heart flutters a little in his chest, which is not a feeling he would have predicted he\u2019d experience over getting what is likely the last piece of bread in Derek\u2019s cupboards. Too bad he can\u2019t soak it in egg yolk \u2014 Derek really did fry the hell out of the eggs. \u201cSure,\u201d he says, and crams in a mouthful. It\u2019s not the worst.</p>\n<p>At the station, Stiles\u2019 dad is about a seven on a scale of one to looking like hell. \u201cStiles,\u201d he says, and puts down the files he\u2019s holding and pulls Stiles close, and hugs him tight before releasing him. \u201cListen, the coroner ruled this an animal attack, but we can\u2019t go back to the house tonight. I have to stay here and coordinate with the sheriff down in Culver Point. Can you stay with someone tonight?\u201d </p>\n<p>Stiles frowns. \u201cI could ask Mrs. McCall, maybe,\u201d he says. He hasn\u2019t seen her much since high school, although back then, she would have had a good case for claiming Stiles as a dependent for tax purposes.</p>\n<p>Stiles\u2019 dad looks at Derek. \u201cI know it\u2019s a lot to ask, but could Stiles stay with you tonight?\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek has what is undoubtedly the best poker expression in the universe \u2014 seriously, Stiles could take that to Vegas and clean up. \u201cI don\u2019t mind. I\u2019ve got the room.\u201d</p>\n<p>His dad looks really relieved, which he probably wouldn\u2019t be if he could see Stiles\u2019 neck under his scarf and borrowed hoodie and knew who was responsible.</p>\n<p>Stiles more or less railroads Derek into stopping at the grocery store on the way back, so that he can buy real food to stock Derek\u2019s probably-empty fridge.</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you making meatballs?\u201d Derek asks at checkout, with a kind of hopefulness that is almost pathetic to behold.</p>\n<p>\u201c<i>Am</i> I,\u201d Stiles says, and doesn\u2019t even fight Derek that hard when he gently shoves Stiles out of the way to pay.</p>\n<p>Derek eats a pile of pasta and a really astonishing number of meatballs \u2014 which, not to blow his own whistle, but they are pretty delicious \u2014 and then they sack out in front of Derek\u2019s old television, one that was probably state of the art fifteen years ago, but is now just a huge behemoth that doesn\u2019t get HD.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou can barely see the puck,\u201d Stiles complains as they watch the mesmerizing patterns of hockey players moving up and down the ice.</p>\n<p>Derek has him tucked against his side, and seriously, he\u2019s like a furnace. \u201cMaybe not with your eyes,\u201d he says, his voice a low, soothing rumble.</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you calling my eyes deficient, is that what you\u2019re doing?\u201d Stiles huffs.</p>\n<p>\u201cI like your eyes,\u201d Derek says, and from anyone else, that would be such a line, but Derek just holds him and continues to watch the game.</p>\n<p>At the end of the first period, Stiles finally musters up the nerve to say, \u201cYou made me a promise earlier, you know.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek tenses next to him, and Stiles thinks he\u2019s misstepped, that he\u2019s broken whatever this is between them by mentioning it, but Derek just turns his face into Stiles\u2019 hair and inhales sharply.</p>\n<p>Maybe he\u2019s been conditioned into this response, but Stiles feels his face heat, and when Derek brushes his mouth over the curve of Stiles\u2019 ear, not even really kissing, just dragging his lips along until he gets to Stiles\u2019 earlobe, Stiles can hear the catch in his own breathing as he waits for Derek to do something, anything, his skin feeling agonizingly sensitized and when Derek slowly tongues the skin under Stiles\u2019 ear and then sucks the lobe in between his teeth, Stiles make a high, desperate noise and tilts his head to give Derek access to anything he wants.</p>\n<p>He wants to point out that this is still not kissing, still not what Derek promised, but he can\u2019t <i>think</i> when Derek starts in on the hickeys on his neck again, unzipping the hoodie Stiles borrowed enough to pull the impeding fabric out of the way so Derek can lick his skin, and again with the sniffing, but Stiles doesn\u2019t even care anymore, he just grabs Derek\u2019s shoulder with one hand and pulls him down, pulls him on top of Stiles, and Derek is obviously with that plan, he\u2019s with it a lot, he rearranges them so that Stiles\u2019 thighs are cradling Derek\u2019s hips, and wow, his eyes are looking a little extra blue again in the light from the TV, and Stiles opens his mouth to say something \u2014</p>\n<p>Derek finally kisses him, and Stiles\u2019 eyes slide shut, because this, this needs his complete and entire attention, and thank god ADD is not biting him in the ass right now, because for once, his brain is in total agreement \u2014 the only thing Stiles needs to focus on is the warm press of Derek\u2019s lips against his, the swipe of Derek\u2019s tongue in his mouth, the little subvocal groans Derek is making, like there\u2019s nothing better than this, nothing more that Derek wants, and oh god, Stiles might be tempted to agree except that Derek is also rolling his hips just slightly against Stiles, and <i>oh</i>.</p>\n<p>Stiles has just worked a hand up under the back of Derek\u2019s shirt when Derek ends the kiss abruptly and presses his face into Stiles\u2019 shoulder again, which, okay, probably Derek\u2019s neck-fixation is a full-blown fetish, but whatever, it\u2019s harmless and it\u2019s not like Stiles doesn\u2019t enjoy it. \u201cYou can,\u201d Stiles says, panting a little for breath, and then decides more encouragement is in order. \u201cI like it. I want you to.\u201d</p>\n<p>He can feel Derek <i>shudder</i> against him at that, but Derek doesn\u2019t take him up on it, just lies there quietly until their breathing has slowed to something approaching normal. And then Derek sits up, looks down at Stiles with a strange expression on his face, before he manhandles Stiles into lying down with him on the couch, Derek behind him and both of them facing the television.</p>\n<p>Okay. Maybe Derek is just really, really into hockey and didn\u2019t want to miss the second period.</p>\n<p>Stiles starts to doze off during overtime, and Derek relocates them to his bedroom \u2014 and before Stiles can feel any guilt about taking Derek\u2019s bed, Derek slides right in next to him. Stiles thinks that finally, finally he understands where this is going, but he\u2019s wrong again, because Derek just spoons him, knees warm where they\u2019re tucked behind Stiles\u2019 and Derek\u2019s arm draped over his waist. Stiles thinks he\u2019ll never be able to fall asleep, not with the long nap he had that afternoon, and especially not with Derek all wrapped around him, but he\u2019s wrong about that, too.</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>Stiles\u2019 dad and Derek both pointedly refuse to talk about the case with Stiles at all, even when he points out that as the person who found half a body on the porch, he might be the best person to talk to.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhich is why Derek took your statement,\u201d Stiles\u2019 dad says with a put-upon sigh. \u201cLeave the police work to the actual police, Stiles.\u201d</p>\n<p>Still, for all that they aren\u2019t talking about the case, Stiles notices a distinct synchronicity of scheduling that\u2019s pretty unusual for Beacon Hills PD \u2014 namely, that his dad and Derek are never on duty at the same time, and Derek seems to be spending all his off-duty hours with Stiles. Hours that include a whole lot of start-and-stop making out but zero orgasms, which is really making Stiles reconsider whether the Hales are a weirdo cult, after all.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m going to work on your jeep today,\u201d Derek says against Stiles\u2019 lips.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh god, please tell me that\u2019s a euphemism,\u201d Stiles says, and clutches more tightly at Derek\u2019s shoulders.</p>\n<p>He feels Derek smile against his lips before kissing him some more, and it\u2019s getting pretty heated before Derek breaks it off, and catches his breath with his forehead resting against Stiles\u2019 neck.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s really not a euphemism, but if Stiles had realized that Derek working on his jeep would net him Derek in jeans and tank top, he might have taken Derek up on his offer sooner. It\u2019s so, so dangerous, because he already wants to climb Derek like a tree all the time, and now he has a first class view of Derek\u2019s ass as he bends over while checking out the engine, and he can see the swirling lines of a tattoo between Derek\u2019s shoulder blades, and \u2014</p>\n<p>Derek is looking at him expectantly, with a little quirk at the corner of his mouth.</p>\n<p>\u201cDid you say something?\u201d Stiles says, dazed.</p>\n<p>\u201cCould you pass me the socket wrench?\u201d Derek says, obviously repeating.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhich one?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe one in your hand, Stiles,\u201d Derek says patiently, and yeah, he\u2019s definitely amused. Stiles just stews in sexual frustration while Derek does some mysterious things with the innards of his jeep, but when Derek tells him to start the jeep, it obediently purrs to life.</p>\n<p>\u201cMy hero,\u201d Stiles says, eyebrows going up in surprise.</p>\n<p>Derek has a few dark smears of oil on his skin, and his shirt isn\u2019t much better, but he\u2019s grinning and looking so pleased with himself that Stiles can only smile back helplessly in return.</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>Scott\u2019s apparently back in town for the weekend, or so Stiles deduces from the text message he gets, demanding his presence with the requisite glove and stick for a friendly pick-up game of lacrosse. Stiles thinks it\u2019s a little cold to be doing this for fun, but whatever \u2014 he\u2019ll layer, they\u2019ll run around, it\u2019ll be fine.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s a little nervous about them meeting after dark, but it\u2019s not like the field isn\u2019t pretty well lit. Just the same, though, he texts Derek to let him know where Stiles is going to be. It\u2019s not like they have actual plans, but he doesn\u2019t want Derek to come by the house only to find that Stiles isn\u2019t home.</p>\n<p>\u201cDude!\u201d Scott says when he gets to the field, and gives him a good bro hug. \u201cAre you okay? My mom said something freaky happened at your place, why didn\u2019t you tell me?\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles shrugs, then, feeling uncomfortable in a way he usually doesn\u2019t with Scott. \u201cNot the kind of thing you text, you know?\u201d he says.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, I guess,\u201d Scott says, and drops it easily. Stiles is trying to figure out if that bothers him, but he doesn\u2019t have time as everyone gets ready to play.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s actually a pretty fun game \u2014 they\u2019re not going all out, but they\u2019re having a good time and Stiles is pleased that this feels comfortable, and maybe he should have looked into doing something like this before now. He can see that he was a little lonely when he moved back in his dad, before he met Derek, like Beacon Hills was this place he didn\u2019t fit into anymore \u2014 well, he fit less than he ever did before.</p>\n<p>He looks up halfway through, for no particular reason, and sees that Derek is sitting off to the side, watching the game. He gives Stiles a little wave when their eyes meet, but then Stiles nearly gets clobbered by a weedy high school junior and decides that he\u2019d better pay attention.</p>\n<p>\u201cIsn\u2019t that Deputy Hale?\u201d says another one of the juniors after the game, less weedy and more tragically short. He sounds distinctly nervous.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, so don\u2019t crack open whatever bottom-shelf rum you have in your bag,\u201d Stiles says, rolling his eyes.</p>\n<p>The junior goes even more wide-eyed. \u201cHow did you know?\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles isn\u2019t sure, but he thinks he just saw Derek crack up at something. Must be something funny on his phone.</p>\n<p>He picks up the hoodie he took off about ten minutes into the game, and trots over to where Derek is waiting, hands in his pockets. He\u2019s still in uniform, with his official PD jacket on. \u201cHere to keep an eye on the hooligans?\u201d Stiles asks.</p>\n<p>Derek\u2019s mouth quirks into a smile, and he reaches out to brush a finger along the side of Stiles\u2019 neck, where the sweat has already cooled. \u201cSomebody has to. Where are you parked?\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles leads him down the field to the side of the road he parked on, knowing that Derek is going to insist on seeing Stiles into the inside of his jeep and following him home. But the closer they get to Stiles\u2019 jeep, the stranger Derek seems to be \u2014 he\u2019s sticking close, sort of bumping Stiles along, and seems awfully jumpy.</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d Stiles whispers, and Derek actually <i>growls</i> at him. Stiles\u2019 mouth snaps shut.</p>\n<p>And then, just like that, the wolf is back, but the difference is, Stiles isn\u2019t alone this time \u2014 he\u2019s with Derek, and at least Derek has a gun in case the wolf is rabid after all. \u201cOh my god, okay, that\u2019s the same wolf,\u201d Stiles says in an urgent murmur.</p>\n<p>\u201cI know he is,\u201d Derek says \u2014 snarls, really. \u201cLet me be absolutely clear \u2014 you\u2019re trespassing.\u201d</p>\n<p>The wolf paces back and forth a little, still looking at them, and \u2014 \u201cDerek, are you talking to a wild animal?\u201d Stiles says carefully. When he dares to take his eyes off the wolf for a second to look at Derek, all the air is sucked out of his lungs.</p>\n<p>Derek looks a little like the vampires from Buffy, only not so bumpy but jesus christ, seriously with the bright blue glowing eyes and the <i>really</i> sharp set of teeth, oh my god oh my god oh my god. \u201cYou\u2019re in Hale pack territory, and you wore out your welcome the first time you harmed a human,\u201d Derek says, all steely authority. \u201cYou\u2019ll leave tonight, or I\u2019ll give you up to the Hunters. Your choice.\u201d</p>\n<p>The wolf sits back on its haunches and howls, and it sounds like a taunt, of all things.</p>\n<p>\u201cOr we can go with option three, which is me tearing out your throat with my teeth,\u201d Derek says. \u201cI\u2019d prefer not to, but the longer you stay, the more likely that\u2019s looking.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles just holds his breath, waiting, and that\u2019s when shit gets uncomfortably real, because Derek is <i>taking off his clothes</i>, what the ever living fuck, just stripping down right there, and then \u2014</p>\n<p>Stiles is looking at a large, black wolf, and thinking very seriously about hyperventilating.</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>Because his dad instilled in him a certain measure of self-preservation, Stiles gets the hell out of the way when Derek mixes it up with the other wolf, because there is a lot of growling and claws and biting and <i>blood</i>, oh god, but the other wolf\u2019s coat is paler, and it looks like the blood is his. Before he knows it, the other wolf is rolling over, and okay, Stiles is actually a little worried that Derek\u2019s going to follow through on his threat, even though apparently Mr. Pale Wolf savaged a couple of people and also dismembered a jogger who had been killed in a hit and run, and therefore Stiles maybe shouldn\u2019t be sympathetic, but come on, it\u2019s still an animal, and Stiles really can\u2019t stand to see animals hurt.</p>\n<p>But the pale wolf whines, and then Derek steps back, and allows him to limp away. Derek turns then to face Stiles, before trotting over to his pile of clothes and all of a sudden, between one eye blink and the next, Derek is a wolf no longer, just an ordinary-looking human pulling a police uniform back on.</p>\n<p>\u201cI really, really didn\u2019t ask google the right questions,\u201d Stiles says finally. It\u2019s annoying, honestly \u2014 you think your research skills are top notch, pride yourself on your ability to analyze things, but then totally miss that your hot cop boyfriend is a werewolf.</p>\n<p>Derek tilts his head to the side a little, a gesture extremely reminiscent of himself in wolf form. \u201cWhy did you stay? Anybody else would have gotten in their car and driven off.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles snorts. \u201cI think we\u2019ve established that I\u2019m not anybody else.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek narrows his eyes. \u201cYour heartbeat is fairly steady. I expected you to\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou can hear my heartbeat from here?\u201d Stiles says. \u201cWow, okay, interesting. Wait, why are you a cop in Beacon Hills, you could be an amazing crime-fighting detective, seriously, you\u2019re totally wasted here.\u201d</p>\n<p>It\u2019s Derek\u2019s turn to snort. \u201cThe point is to stay under the radar, Stiles. Which is the opposite of what that jackass was doing.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHuh,\u201d Stiles says. \u201cAll right. Wait, okay, what, were you trying to be stealthy? Because the marks I\u2019ve got from your teeth \u2014 opposite of stealth, right there. Seriously, you need to make them under my collar or I\u2019m going to be doomed to douchey hipster scarf forever, and I really don\u2019t know if I\u2019m ready for that kind of image change.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek looks \u2014 wow, Stiles thinks he looks honestly <i>embarrassed</i>, and he\u2019s inching closer to Stiles, like he thinks Stiles is going to bolt at any second. \u201cI wasn\u2019t prepared,\u201d Derek says, his voice low. \u201cI didn\u2019t know that I was going to feel like that. Around you.\u201d</p>\n<p>He\u2019s close now, and Stiles has to look up to meet his eyes. \u201cLike what?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou make me <i>crazy</i>,\u201d Derek says, nearly a moan, and he rests his face against the side of Stiles\u2019 head, lips not far from the marks on his neck, and okay, maybe other people might have some second thoughts after watching a guy grow a set of fangs, but to Stiles, this feels comfortingly familiar. \u201cYou just \u2014 at first, you just smelled good.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles actually cracks a smile at that. \u201cUh, thanks. I mean, not so bad yourself.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Derek says. \u201cI mean, you smelled like \u2014 like a home. Like you could be my home. Like you could be mine.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles feels his eyes go wide, because that\u2019s a hell of a lot more than someone complimenting your moisturizer.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou make me crazy,\u201d Derek says again, words rumbling against the sensitive skin under Stiles\u2019 ear. \u201cI kept telling myself that we couldn\u2019t do anything until you knew about me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWait a second,\u201d Stiles says, his brain jumping track as it\u2019s wont to do. \u201cDoes my dad know? Is this like \u2014 is this some kind of <i>outreach</i>?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Derek says, pulling back to look at Stiles. \u201cAre you asking me if I\u2019m a \u2014 werewolf affirmative action hire?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Stiles says defensively. \u201cAlso, oh my god, your family home up north is like a ranch of werewolves, isn\u2019t it. That\u2019s better than what I was thinking, I thought you were some kind of cult that didn\u2019t approve of two people of the masculine persuasion getting it on.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek stares at him. \u201cNo, your father doesn\u2019t know,\u201d he says finally. \u201cAnd I can\u2019t believe you thought my family was a cult.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt seemed like a better explanation than the other ones available to me,\u201d Stiles says, wincing a little. \u201cWhich didn\u2019t include secret werewolf, just in case you were curious. I thought maybe you just \u2014 felt bad about it, or just didn\u2019t want that much with me. Even though I really \u2014 really wanted it with you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI wanted everything with you,\u201d Derek says, looking pained. \u201cI still do.\u201d </p>\n<p>Stiles stares at him, because \u2014 he doesn\u2019t know what to do with that, he really doesn\u2019t, but he can\u2019t stand to see Derek looking like that, still braced for Stiles to say thanks but no thanks, I liked you fine until I found about about your monthly problem. So Stiles gets a fistful of Derek\u2019s jacket and pulls him into a kiss. The noise that Derek makes against his mouth is small and vulnerable, and the kiss goes from sweet to desperate and if Stiles makes Derek crazy, the feeling is mutual.</p>\n<p>\u201cCan we go home, now?\u201d Stiles says after he breaks the kiss. \u201cBecause I\u2019m starving. And I need a shower. At minimum.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Derek says, smiling softly. \u201cWe can go home.\u201d</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>Stiles drives to Derek\u2019s place, Derek following behind, and it isn\u2019t until much later that Stiles realizes they never discussed whose home they were going to, but then again \u2014 that is probably some sort of sign. It starts to rain on the drive over, cold and steady and inevitably challenging Stiles\u2019 ability to keep his windshield from fogging up.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhen I said I needed a shower, I didn\u2019t mean this!\u201d Stiles grumbles to Derek as they make a break for the front door. It\u2019s too late, though \u2014 it\u2019s coming down hard, and they\u2019re both soaked by the time they get there. Derek unlocks the door and goes in first, and Stiles is wiping uselessly at his hair as he follows.</p>\n<p>Derek shuts the door behind them, and pushes Stiles up against it.</p>\n<p>\u201cI seriously reek,\u201d Stiles informs him. \u201cDon\u2019t you have some sort of super werewolf nose? I should be like, extra offending you right now.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek tucks his nose under Stiles\u2019 ear and sniffs him, and wow, he must have been seriously trying to restrain himself before, because with the werewolf out of the proverbial bag, Derek is sniffing and licking down his neck, his tongue catching rainwater as he goes.</p>\n<p>\u201cUnless you super get off on it, oh my god, you do, don\u2019t you,\u201d Stiles says, and he thinks he means for that to sound accusatory, but it just sounds breathless and hopelessly turned on, and Derek growls and manhandles him into the kitchen. Stiles wonders for a second if Derek actually intends to break up the festivities by feeding Stiles as planned, only not so much, as it turns out \u2014 because their wet clothes are hitting the tiled floor, and Derek backs him up against the counter, pulls down Stiles\u2019 boxer briefs and gets on his knees. He fights off a giggle when Derek dips his tongue in his navel, and then he\u2019s definitely not laughing when Derek sniffs and licks his way down Stiles\u2019 stomach, and then he doesn\u2019t even have time to have any reservations about sharp teeth before Derek sucks him in.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s not like he hasn\u2019t had a blow job before, but it\u2019s clear that, unlike drunken rugby hookups, Derek knows what he\u2019s doing, and he\u2019s <i>really</i> into it. Like, that level of enthusiasm is not something Stiles has a lot of experience with, and in combination with Derek holding his gaze while swallowing him down, it\u2019s no wonder his thighs are trembling under Derek\u2019s hands.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh my god,\u201d Stiles says brokenly, because Derek\u2019s tongue is <i>wrecking</i> him, and it\u2019s all he can do to clutch the counter edge to keep himself upright. The noises he\u2019s making echo in the kitchen, and if it sounds loud to him, then Derek has to hear every gasp as a shout, every choked moan as a wail, but if it bothers him, he doesn\u2019t show it \u2014 and when Stiles tries to warn him that he\u2019s going to come, Derek just grabs his ass with both hands and takes Stiles down his throat, virtually wresting his orgasm from him, demanding that Stiles give it up to him with the flex of his fingers against Stiles\u2019 ass and the slide of his lips around Stiles\u2019 cock.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh my god,\u201d Stiles says again, but more weakly. Derek lets him slide down to sit on the floor, and Stiles is about to beg for a minute or two grace period before returning the favor, but Derek just straddles him, unzips his uniform pants, takes out his cock and starts to jerk himself off roughly. \u201cI can \u2014 let me\u2014\u201d Stiles starts to say, reaching for Derek.</p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t get far, because Derek takes both of his wrists in one hand and pins them over his head, still staring at Stiles, hips rocking a little with his strokes, and okay, message received, but Stiles never takes a straight up no for an answer. \u201cYou sure?\u201d Stiles asks. \u201cYou don\u2019t want my mouth, maybe? Not to brag, but plenty of people like this mouth.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek actually snarls at that, and his eyes go dangerously blue, and Stiles can see a bit of fang when Derek\u2019s mouth drops open as he comes messily all over Stiles\u2019 chest.</p>\n<p>If Stiles was filthy before, he\u2019s beyond filthy now \u2014 and jesus, that was before Derek started rubbing his come into his skin, <i>what</i>. \u201cI need a shower for sure, now,\u201d Stiles says, watching the proceedings with an equal amount of disbelief and sure knowledge that it would turn him on if Derek hadn\u2019t just blown him to within an inch of his life.</p>\n<p>\u201cLet\u2019s eat, first,\u201d Derek says.</p>\n<p>\u201cReally?\u201d Stiles says, feeling dazed. \u201cYou want me to eat when I\u2019m all covered in \u2014 no, what am I thinking, of course you do.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI have leftover pizza,\u201d Derek informs him, looking extremely serious.</p>\n<p>\u201cAmazing,\u201d Stiles says, although mostly what surprises him is the idea that any leftovers lasted the night in Derek\u2019s fridge.</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>Insofar as actually getting clean is concerned, their shower is sort of two steps forward, one step back and a one lengthy side trip into Derek pushing him up against the tile and rimming him with a great deal of enthusiasm, then getting him filthy again by jerking off onto Stiles\u2019 back. Clearly, this is going to be a thing.</p>\n<p>When they are both clean again, and furthermore challenging an old water heater\u2019s will to live, Stiles pulls Derek back across the chilly hallway into the warmth of his bedroom, walking backward until he hits Derek\u2019s bed and sprawls back into the blankets. He\u2019s waiting for Derek to pounce, but Derek is just looking down at him, and really not making with the further demonstrations on how lycanthropy can be fun for everyone.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt was harder than I ever would have imagined,\u201d Derek says finally, his voice a gravelly husk. \u201cSmelling your scent all wrapped up in mine, here in my bed, and sleeping without you. I wanted so many crazy things, I barely recognized myself.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m here now,\u201d Stiles says, and offers an anxious half-smile, a little uncomfortable with the intensity of Derek\u2019s regard.</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you want to be?\u201d Derek asks.</p>\n<p>Stiles raises his eyebrows, and takes one look down as if to assure himself, yep, still hard, still waiting in Derek\u2019s bed with nothing doing. \u201cCan\u2019t you tell? I\u2019d think you\u2019d be able to smell me if nothing else.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d Derek says, and oh, that sounds <i>satisfied</i>, before he frowns again. \u201cBut it doesn\u2019t tell me if you want to stay.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles\u2019 throat tightens a little. \u201cWhat, for the night?\u201d he says, aiming for casual but missing by a mile with the wobble in his voice.</p>\n<p>\u201cNot just for the night,\u201d Derek says, with such certainty that Stiles stares at him wide-eyed, disbelieving, but Derek doesn\u2019t make it into a joke, doesn\u2019t take it back, just keeps his eyes locked on Stiles\u2019.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou want me to stay?\u201d he asks, voice small, because no one\u2019s ever asked him that before. \u201cYou really want me to stay?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI never want you to leave,\u201d Derek says, and then looks chagrined. \u201cWait, I know that sounds crazy. Of course you can leave, it\u2019s not house arrest, I just meant\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI want to be with you all the time,\u201d Stiles interrupts.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, that\u2019s what I meant,\u201d Derek says, looking relieved.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, Derek, I meant \u2014 I want to be with you all the time.\u201d It\u2019s strange how easy it feels to say that, but it\u2019s true, and it\u2019s been true for a while. None of tonight\u2019s revelations have changed that.</p>\n<p>Derek must see it, must believe it, because now he chooses to pounce, bracketing Stiles\u2019 head with his forearms and leaning down to kiss Stiles like he\u2019d do it forever, and Stiles just reaches up and grabs a handful of Derek\u2019s hair to keep him there.</p>\n<p>Eventually Derek does move his mouth elsewhere, largely because Stiles is whining, \u201cDerek, come on, you\u2019re killing me, not all of us got off in the shower, some of us just got our brains turned inside out and were left hanging, <i>Derek</i>\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek flips Stiles over onto his stomach, mouth nipping a stinging kiss at his nape before his tongue slides down Stiles\u2019 spine, and Derek parts his cheeks and licks into him <i>again</i>, like he didn\u2019t just nearly make Stiles come from only doing this, and Stiles sobs out, \u201cI can\u2019t, no more, you have to fuck me, <i>please</i>, oh please\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>He hears the click of a cap, and then Derek is pressing one slick finger into him, being so, so gentle, even though it\u2019s not like it\u2019s the first time Stiles has done this, but he knows better than to say so. Derek\u2019s apparently a little territorial, and Stiles really would rather he didn\u2019t go all werewolf-y in the middle of sex. Well. Maybe just a little, the growling is kind of hot. Derek leans down so that he\u2019s mostly covering Stiles with his body, steadily fucking Stiles with three fingers now, nosing around Stiles\u2019 neck and making pleased noises every time Stiles moans and writhes back onto his fingers.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve wanted to do this so bad, I wanted everyone to know you were mine,\u201d Derek says in his ear, and yeah, that growl is back.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou can, come on,\u201d Stiles says, and shoves his hips back once before deciding to adopt a different tack, because Derek is showing no signs of getting with the program. \u201cYou think it was good before, just rubbing it into my skin? You\u2019re going to fuck me, come inside me, mark me\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek freezes. \u201cYou\u2019d let me do that?\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles regains enough brain cell usage to say, \u201cCan we skip the part where I might have peeked at your medical records and just go with no condoms necessary, feel free to go to town?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<i>Stiles</i>,\u201d Derek says, and finally, finally pulls his fingers out and tugs Stiles\u2019 hips up, one hand bracing his shoulder while Derek slowly pushes his cock inside.</p>\n<p>Stiles is propped up on his forearms, head hanging down as he tries to get used to it, and it goes from a little uncomfortable to really, really good in almost no time, and he\u2019s about to wonder what he\u2019ll have to say to get Derek to cut loose, but apparently, he doesn\u2019t need to beg at all, because Derek just pushes Stiles\u2019 shoulders down, leaving his ass angled up, and begins to fuck him in earnest.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh god,\u201d Stiles moans, because he\u2019s going to come any second, he\u2019s sure, no one could withstand Derek\u2019s tongue twice and his cock and not have an earth-shaking orgasm, he\u2019ll barely have to touch himself to\u2014</p>\n<p>\u201c<i>No</i>,\u201d Derek snarls, and pulls his wrist away. \u201cLike this,\u201d he says, and grinds in, moving his hips until Stiles whimpers, because of course Derek has great observational skills and is totally committed to deducing the best angle and then <i>nailing</i> it.</p>\n<p>It doesn\u2019t take much more than that before Stiles takes in one shaking, desperate breath and then comes hard, all over the sheets beneath him, eyes squeezed shut as Derek slows down, then groans in Stiles\u2019 ear as his hips stutter against Stiles\u2019 ass. They stay like that until Derek eases him to lie down flat, Derek still inside him but not letting Stiles take all his weight.</p>\n<p>\u201cWow,\u201d Stiles says finally.</p>\n<p>\u201cMmm,\u201d Derek says, by way of agreement. He seems disinclined to roll off, even though it\u2019s got to be getting uncomfortable to prop himself up like that. Stiles can hold a plank with the best of them, which is to say about fifteen seconds, but this is ridiculous.</p>\n<p>\u201cCome on, off,\u201d Stiles says. \u201cZero snowballing can commence until you pull out.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek goes extremely still behind him.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat, seriously? You know you\u2019re going to do it. I want you to,\u201d Stiles cajoles.</p>\n<p>\u201cUnbelievable,\u201d Derek mutters, but of course, as it turns out, Stiles is totally right about everything.</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>Stiles doesn\u2019t have to be up, but Derek does, so he stays in Derek\u2019s wreck of a bed while Derek jumps in the shower.</p>\n<p>Derek still has damp hair and is only in his boxer briefs when his phone rings. He frowns at the display, then hits the screen. \u201cThis is Hale.\u201d A beat. \u201cYes, sir. He\u2019s right here.\u201d Stiles gives him an unfriendly look, but takes the phone.</p>\n<p>\u201cYo, dad,\u201d he says.</p>\n<p>\u201cYo, son,\u201d his dad says dryly. \u201cNow, I know we had this big talk before you moved back in, about how you\u2019re an adult and your own person, but I reserve the right to be concerned when Scott calls looking for you and says you\u2019re not answering your phone. And then you don\u2019t answer your phone when I call you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUh,\u201d Stiles says, and leans over the side of the bed to find his phone. The battery is seriously gone, and probably has been for a few hours. \u201cSorry about that, need to recharge it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI suppose I should be glad you\u2019re with Derek,\u201d his dad sighs. \u201cAlthough, again, I reserve the right to be extremely suspicious about Derek being able to immediately lay hands on you at seven in the morning.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, about that,\u201d Stiles says, because this isn\u2019t some flash in the pan, and Derek\u2019s not a rugby boy, and if his dad\u2019s going to freak out about Stiles having something cooking with his deputy, well, a.) he shouldn\u2019t have hired someone that attractive, b.) he\u2019d rather just get this out in the open and over with. He looks up at Derek, who has been shamelessly eavesdropping, he\u2019s sure, and waggles his eyebrows in an attempt to communicate, <i>hey, you want me to put this all on the table?</i></p>\n<p>Derek gives him a minute nod, and Stiles says, \u201cSo, about Derek.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo details, ever, and he keeps coming to Sunday dinner,\u201d his dad says immediately.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat, no threats? What if he breaks my heart? Come on, I\u2019m worth at least one good warning about how you have a gun, right?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGive the phone back to Derek,\u201d his dad says.</p>\n<p>Derek takes it and cradles it against his shoulder while he wanders out into the hallway, and Stiles can hear the wood floor creak as he walks down the hall. Stiles is just starting to do a vague cost-benefit analysis on dragging himself out of bed for breakfast, when Derek comes back into the bedroom, uniform on and everything in place.</p>\n<p>Stiles looks him up and down, because he can, and because <i>damn</i>. \u201cI know you have to go in to the station, but I really wish I could take those pants off with my teeth.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek pinches the bridge of his nose. \u201cDon\u2019t say things like that when I have to leave the house,\u201d he says, but he sounds more affectionate than scolding. He leans down to give Stiles a kiss, warm and tender and too brief, as far as Stiles is concerned. He pauses in the doorway on his way out and says, \u201cOh, and Stiles.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p>\n<p>The corner of Derek\u2019s mouth turns up. \u201cYour dad says he has a gun, and if I ever break your heart, the county coroner won\u2019t be able to identify my remains.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAwesome,\u201d Stiles says sincerely, and Derek snorts.</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>A year later, Derek is giving the pile of Stiles\u2019 stuff in his dad\u2019s garage a critical eye. \u201cIt\u2019s not that much. We can move it ourselves.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYour sister says she can come down with the truck,\u201d Stiles says, rocking back on his heels.</p>\n<p>\u201cCompletely unnecessary, in all ways. And why are you talking to Laura?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLook, if you track coyote movement on this thing called a computer, chances are, you spend a significant amount of time on said computer, which means you might be bored in the middle of the day and end up chatting with people who are online, namely me,\u201d Stiles says. \u201cAlso, we are bros.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek makes a face.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd your mom says she wants us to come up to the ranch for New Year\u2019s,\u201d Stiles continues.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy are you talking to my <i>mom</i>,\u201d Derek says, in something that he would deny is a whine but it totally is.</p>\n<p>\u201cBecause she calls me and she\u2019s nice,\u201d Stiles says. \u201cAnd I have blackmail material forever, believe me \u2014 your mom is really forthcoming. I thought the story about your ice-skating adventure when you were seven and accompanying ice vomit was particularly touching.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek grumbles, \u201cI am reconsidering all of my life choices.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou are not,\u201d Stiles says, and wraps one arm around Derek\u2019s waist. \u201cI mean, you\u2019re not, right? You still want me to move in?\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek wraps an arm around his shoulder and pulls him closer still. \u201cI want you to move in,\u201d he says against Stiles\u2019 hair.</p>\n<p>Whatever tension he was holding melts away. \u201cGood,\u201d Stiles says. \u201cI\u2019m just saying, if your sister is going to help us move, then we don\u2019t have to do this today. Also my dad is at the station. My point is, we could be giving my bed a fond farewell right now.\u201d</p>\n<p>He can feel Derek\u2019s suddenly interested inhale.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s not that he needs to sweeten the deal, but variety is the spice of life, etcetera. \u201cChase me,\u201d Stiles says, and Derek lets him wiggle away and run through the house and up the stairs, only to gently tackle him on the bed, abused springs creaking and Stiles\u2019 laughter filling the air.</p>"
