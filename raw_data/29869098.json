  "notes": "<p>There will be heavy triggers all through this fic. I will be sure to add new or specific ones at the start of each chapter, but if you are sensitive to descriptions of suicidal thoughts or actions, talks of eating disorders, or blood and violence, this fic is not for you.</p>\n<p>The playlist for the fic is here: https://open.spotify.com/playlist/4oSUCJDkYpdakoo7lhA8rf?si=0adp_dujTkiIBoGn06_rNQ</p>\n<p>Thank you for reading.</p>\n<p>TW: NON-GRAPHIC REFERENCE TO SELF HARM</p>\n<p>TW: TALKS OF ED RELATED TENDENCIES</p>\n<p>TW: MENTION OF ED RELATED TENDENCIES</p>\n<p>TW: TALKS OF SUICIDE ATTEMPTS, SELF-HARM, AND VOMITING</p>\n<p>TW: IN-DEPTH TALKS OF SUICIDE.</p>\n<p>\n(See the end of the chapter for <a href=\"#chapter_7_endnotes\">more notes</a>.)\n</p>\n<p>just a psa, I was not trying to get you to like Mina, just explain some actions. I am not condoning anything bad either of them have done, but mental illness makes you do bad shit sometimes and that can fuck with other people. I am in no way saying you have to like her, but please don\u2019t attack me for presenting reasonings for characters actions. I thought I made it clear Kirishima was apologetic because he\u2019s in a spot where he thinks everything is his fault, not because he is completely wrong.</p>\n<p>HEAVY TRIGGER WARNINGS FOR MOST TRIGGERS: INCLUDING SH AND DRUG RELATED OVERDOSE. </p>\n<p>DO NOT REPEAT THE ACTIONS SHOWN IN THIS CHAPTER.</p>\n<p>\n(See the end of the chapter for <a href=\"#chapter_14_endnotes\">notes</a>.)\n</p>\n<p>Wow... it's over. this fic has been such a journey for me as someone who was really just writing about their struggles. If you take anything for this, it's that you don't have to revert to the person from before to be happy. Trauma and mental illness do define you in ways, in little spaces of yourself you feel like you can never clean. That doesn't mean you can't be happy if some parts of you are tainted. I promise you will be alright. The person who was happy is still you, and they still have a chance.</p>\n<p>So much love,<br>- bri</p>",
  "text": "<p>\n<b> <em>Reason #34 to Live: Today, a little girl in line at the restaurant I stopped at pointed at me, then held up her shark toy. She had a huge smile on her face with all these cute gaps.</em> </b>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<b> <em>Maybe the teeth aren\u2019t so bad.</em> </b>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">***</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kirishima Eijirou was not perfect.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Sometimes he wore the same shirt two days in a row, forgot to brush his teeth in the morning, or didn\u2019t leave the door open for old ladies trying to get groceries.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Once, when he was fifteen, he threw a water bottle off the top of a bridge above the freeway. It had hit a car windshield, splattering so violently that the driver couldn\u2019t see. The red Camaro - yes, Kirishima remembered the exact car - swerved and rear-ended a truck in the passing lane. He hadn\u2019t told anyone about the incident, choosing to keep the extremely bad decision to himself.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kirishima Eijirou made a lot of mistakes; he was willing to admit that.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Oh, yeah.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Then, there was that time he slit his wrists in his bathtub.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It had been earlier that summer when he\u2019d sunk so low he saw no other escape. Yes, it hadn\u2019t been his brightest moment, perhaps one of the dumber things he\u2019d done.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kirishima didn\u2019t know how to tell people that, at the time, that did feel like the right decision. That all the life he had been living was better being swept down the drain than wasted on him. He was fine dying next to the shampoo bottles and last standing rubber ducky from his childhood.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>When he tried to express the feeling - the all-consuming black sludge that dragged him down to the depths of hell - it always came out as whining over his shitty friends, internship, or self-worth issues.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kirishima sunk back into the far too plush couch, eyes on his punishment from the summer\u2019s events.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cKirishima,\u201d his therapist, Ito, said. He leaned forward in his seat, \u201cWhat are you thinking about?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cUA mostly,\u201d Kirishima grumbled, uninterested in talking further. The school had required him to take on therapy after the \u2018incident\u2019, telling him he\u2019d be expelled if he didn\u2019t comply.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>At first, he thought about telling them to suck his dick, but he realized that he was in far too deep to just give up now.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Plus, that meant staying with his parents instead of at the dorms. He couldn\u2019t handle staring at the locked knife drawer anymore.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Ito nodded, \u201cThat makes sense. Are you excited to see your friends?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cFriends,\u201d Kirishima scoffed, digging his heel into the carpet, \u201cI don\u2019t really have those.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>That had been true since Mina had confessed her feelings at the end of their second year, under the dead cherry blossoms. He had politely declined, but it didn\u2019t matter. Mina took Sero and Denki like they were a set of dogs in the middle of a divorce.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>As for Bakugou?</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kirishima had spent the first two weeks of summer trying to get a response. He tried again after he got out of the hospital, going so far as to call his parents.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>There was a very uncomfortable voicemail on his phone to prove it.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He didn\u2019t know what he had done, but it was clear Bakugou Katsuki wanted nothing to do with him. It was inevitable; he and Midoriya had repaired their long-broken relationship.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>What was the point in keeping Kirishima around if he had Izuku?</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He was reminded of the fact that Ito and his parents were the only people he\u2019d spoken to in months. It made him feel like shit. Wiping at his eyes, he stood up, \u201cI don\u2019t want to be here anymore.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Ito seemed to be expecting that answer, \u201cPlease, I only have one last thing.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kirishima rocked back on his heels, making no move to leave as he waited. Ito dug through a mountain of papers to find why lay underneath them. There was a black notebook.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Opening it, he handed it to Kirishima, who took it reluctantly. He looked down at the blank pages, running a finger over some of the paper, \u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s a journal,\u201d Ito said, handing him a pen from his cupholder, \u201cKirishima, I\u2019m not stupid.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kirishima looked up, a bit confused by the accusation, \u201cDid I say you were?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Ito said, reclining back into his chair, \u201cbut don\u2019t act like you\u2019ve been invested in anything I have to say,\u201d he cracked the knuckles on one hand, \u201cyour inability to fix what you're struggling with is just another form of self-harm. You think you deserve to be depressed and isolated.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kirishima sighed, closing his very tired eyes. This guy was always talking like he knew anything about Kirishima beyond their hour a day. Besides, Ito was acting like he didn\u2019t deserve it, and he most certainly did. If his therapist really knew anything about him, he\u2019d see why he should be dead too.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI can\u2019t tell you that it\u2019s not what you deserve because you won\u2019t believe me,\u201d Ito continued, \u201cbut, in my absence, I\u2019m giving you a mandatory assignment. If you do not complete it, I will have to turn you into the school.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He was going to lose it on this guy, absolutely lose it.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the assignment?\u201d He said through gritted teeth.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cBy the end of the semester, you are to have one-hundred reasons to live written down in there. I don\u2019t care how you do it. I don\u2019t care if they are big or small reasons, as long as they are reasons, that is enough.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThis is stupid,\u201d Kirishima bit.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Why was he angry?</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Ito was just trying to help him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em> You don\u2019t deserve help. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>See, now you\u2019re just proving him right.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIt probably is,\u201d he said, a small smile on his face, \u201cmost of the reasons people stay alive are stupid. Some people do it for their cat or dog, others try to hold out until their favorite TV show ends,\u201d Ito cleared his throat, \u201cWhen I tried to do it in high school, I promised myself I wouldn\u2019t attempt again until All Might retired.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kirishima hated that this guy was so likable. He smiled a little, \u201cYet, you\u2019re still here.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d Ito said, shaking his head, \u201cbecause high school me died a long time ago.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Attention on the journal, Kirishima sighed, \u201cDo you think, one day, high school me can die too?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Ito smiled soft, \u201cHe\u2019ll die on his own, I promise. Let\u2019s not cut off his life early, yeah?\u201d Kirishima nodded, shoving the book into his bag, \u201cI\u2019m serious about the journal. You\u2019re going to show me every update when you come in. Since you\u2019re starting school, we\u2019re going to have to push your appointments back to every three weeks.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>That was fine with Kirishima. He was getting kind of tired of seeing this guy once a week, \u201cSure thing, Doctor Ito.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Ito waved his hand around, \u201cJust Ito, please. We\u2019ve been over this.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kirishima rolled his eyes in amusement, \u201cIt\u2019s still funny.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou keep telling yourself that, Kirishima,\u201d Ito said, smirking. Suddenly, he looked like a thought struck him, \u201cOh, and another thing.\u201d Kirishima hummed in acknowledgment, \u201cMaybe you should change up your appearance. It might help make you feel like\u2026 a different person than the one from this summer,\u201d Ito set a reassuring hand on his shoulder, \u201cI\u2019m not saying it\u2019ll fix everything, but it might help\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kirishima pondered his words for a moment, mind wandering back to the bathroom sink and the cabinet above, \u201cI understand.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Ito had this warped look of concern heavy on his face, \u201cAlright\u2026 Goodbye, Kirishima.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kirishima left, backpack weighing him down. He looked down at the journal as he stepped outside.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>An idea came to mind as he opened the book.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Contrary to popular belief, Kirishima was very competitive; he was a driven, goal-oriented person. Also, he was a firm believer in races.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He clicked the pen Ito had given him, opening the first page. In big letters, he wrote, \u201cReasons To Live: 1-100.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Then, he flipped to the middle of the journal. He paused, felt-tip inches from the page. This was gonna be another mistake to add to his long-running list, wasn\u2019t it?</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Caving, he put the pen to the page.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cReasons to Die: 1-100.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The idea was simple; old as time.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>First to one hundred wins.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">***</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He stayed up late that night, in the company of a bowl of black box dye and stained hands.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">***</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cGet the fuck off of me!\u201d Bakugou bit, shoving Denki off of his shoulder. It was the first goddamn day of school and he was already being annoyed beyond belief. He spent all fucking summer trying to help Deku with All For One and this is what he gets, huh?\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Denki whined, \u201cCome on man! We haven\u2019t seen you all summer! It\u2019s our last year, can you pretend to like us?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Bakugou said, pushing him away again. Mina, in all her bubbly glory, skipped up to the two. He felt like caving in his own skull; it was too early for this shit.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>She crashed into Denki, catching him by the shoulders, \u201cHey! Is that the guy that didn\u2019t text us once all summer?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bakugou growled lowly, turning around. He didn\u2019t need to put up with their bullshit anymore, \u201cIf it makes your bleeding hearts feel better, I didn\u2019t text anyone all summer. Don\u2019t think your fucking special.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhatever,\u201d Denki said, rolling his eyes, \u201cYou missed us.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>That was somewhat true. Working with Deku at Miruko\u2019s agency had been fucking tiring, but at least he was in the company of someone who understood him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Not that Bakugou would ever admit that.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Plus, they\u2019d learned a lot about the League\u2019s underworkings, and behind the scenes, they\u2019d gotten closer to getting Deku to the full mastery of his quirk. Sure, it was hard work, but there was a certain weight that had been lifted off his shoulders. It felt like repayment for his treatment of Deku in middle school.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He was okay with that. They were\u2026 friends now.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Speaking of friends.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhere is Shitty Hair?\u201d He said, looking at the pair. They shared a glance before returning his gaze, both looking extremely guilty.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2026 don\u2019t know,\u201d Mina answered honestly, shoe scuffing the dirt below it.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bakugou furrowed his eyebrows, \u201cYou don\u2019t know?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Denki studied Mina, making a vague gesture with the roll of his hand, \u201cTell him.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>She sighed, hanging her head, \u201cWe got into a fight.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhen,\u201d Bakugou questioned, stepping forward, \u201cand why?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>She made a noise of frustration, \u201cI confessed to him at the end of last year\u2019s semester. He rejected me and\u2026 I didn\u2019t take it very well. We haven\u2019t spoken since.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bakugou stared at them in disgust, \u201cAre you fucking serious? How pathetic.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not like he tried to reach out to me either!\u201d Mina defended, crossing her arms.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, he did,\u201d Denki whispered, sinking downward, \u201cHe texted you like a hundred times.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>She turned to him, \u201cWhen was the last time you talked to him, huh?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou told me not to!\u201d Denki said, putting his hands up.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bakugou felt the churning of anger deep in his gut, teeth grinding together, \u201cAnd you listened to her?!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI had to! Sero was just as mad; he and Mina are my best friends!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd Kirishima wasn\u2019t?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not like that!\u201d He said, \u201cDon\u2019t sit there and act like you care now! We couldn\u2019t even get you to answer us! Tell me when the last time you talked to him was!\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bakugou froze, his phone burning a hole in his pocket. Cutting off his friends had been necessary; he was trying to keep them safe while he and Deku looked into All For One. It\u2019s not like Deku had talked to his friends either\u2026</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Probably.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kirishima had texted him many times over the summer. They were all unread; he couldn\u2019t bring himself to look at them. There were at least a dozen missed calls and a voicemail that had sat there since the third week of break.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He was about to yell again when he caught sight of green hair. Looking down at the pair, he flipped them off, \u201cFuck you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, run away Bakugou! It\u2019s summer all over again,\u201d Mina screamed, pulled away by an upset Denki.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Deku looked over to him, a bit thrown off by his angry footsteps, \u201cKacchan?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cShut up nerd,\u201d He said, voice softer than before.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAh,\u201d Deku hummed, picking up on the frustration, \u201cAre you alright?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cFine,\u201d He said curtly, shoving his hands into his pockets, \u201cYou?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Deku laughed slightly, rolling his eyes, \u201cEvery once and awhile you could say, \u2018How are you Izuku? How has your day been?\u2019, y\u2019know?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bakugou smiled lightly, \u201cAs if.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>They walked in silence for a while, Bakugou trying his best to forget about the early encounter, regret sinking deep into his bones. At the time, his actions hadn\u2019t seemed that bad. Bakugou just assumed his friends would be fine with it. Maybe that had been selfish of him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIf you actually wanted an answer to your not question about my day,\u201d Deku said, a little too cocky for Bakugou\u2019s liking, \u201cIt was good. I finally got to see Ochako and Iida today. It\u2019s been hard only speaking to them over the phone.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Motherfucker</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cRight,\u201d Bakugou said, remorse flooding his tongue like sour milk. He was such an idiot.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>They finally passed through the classroom doors, Bakugou\u2019s mood somehow much worse than this morning. He took his seat behind Deku, making sure to give it an extra kick for good measure.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He looked back at him, shaking his head, \u201cWe can go to Ground Beta right now.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bakugou\u2019s shoulders dropped, \u201cOi. Not funny.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI thought it was,\u201d Deku said, turning back around with a grin.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bakugou glanced over to Kirishima\u2019s desk, noticeably empty despite all the other students being present. His leg bounced in nervousness.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Maybe\u2026</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Maybe Kirishima wasn\u2019t coming. It had been three months since they\u2019d seen each other, or even spoke. He might not be returning. Something could\u2019ve happened and now he didn\u2019t want to be a hero anymore. Kirishima might\u2019ve been hurt, or worse. If something had happened to him, why did nobody tell him and-</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>His phone seemed a lot heavier than usual.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Ignoring Kirishima all this time just to worry about him now? How stupid.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>If he really was a good friend, he would\u2019ve reached out when they weren\u2019t speaking. When <em>he</em> wasn\u2019t speaking. No wonder Kirishima wasn\u2019t here. He probably didn\u2019t want to see him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Just then, the door creaked open, and Bakugou\u2019s eyes shot up. Upon seeing the sight in front of him, his heart jumped into his throat.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kirishima stood there, leaning against the arm he had on the door. He looked\u2026 incredibly Bakugou-like, face twisted into mild annoyance as he stepped into the class. There was a lot different about him at first glance; he was taller, a bit bulkier, and\u2026</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>What the fuck?</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>His hair wasn\u2019t spiked up.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>His hair wasn\u2019t <em>red </em>anymore.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It was shorter and down; it was curlier too.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bakugou\u2019s first reaction was to look at Mina, who also turned to him. They gave each other looks of - what could be described as - mild horror. Denki made a choking noise as he spat back up the water he was drinking.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat the fuck?\u201d he heard Sero whisper, and red eyes snapped to him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kirishima\u2019s face bunched up, looking a certain type of disgusted. \u201cWhat?\u201d he hissed, fists bunching up, \u201cGot something to say all of a sudden?\u201d Sero sank back in his seat.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The mummers of confusion sparked up as Kirishima walked up to Ochako, who seemed unphased by Kirishima\u2019s appearance. He leaned down close to her, saying something softly; a small glimpse of the old Kirishima shining through. She listened intently, nodding along.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>She smiled at him, then picked up her stuff, moving to Kirishima\u2019s old desk.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHi, Kaminari,\u201d She said kindly, taking the seat.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The entire class had their eyes on Kirishima as he sat down, crossing his arms and reclining back in clear disinterest.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cKacchan,\u201d Deku whispered, turning around, \u201cWhat\u2019s up with him?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bakugou was at a loss for words, \u201c... I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know?\u201d Deku scream-whispered, \u201cHow do you not know?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWe haven\u2019t spoken since last semester,\u201d He said back, leaning forward.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Deku said, a little too loud. Red eyes moved to the corner of their sockets, staring Deku down hard.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Deku looked back for a moment before turning back around, \u201cFuck that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDid you just swear?\u201d Bakugou questioned.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Deku stayed facing forward, \u201cThat, Kacchan, is the kind of look you\u2019d give me in middle school. So let me repeat, fuck that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bakugou fell back, mind buzzing with a thousand thoughts as he tried his best not to look at the boy who he thought he knew.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Something really fucked was going on, and Bakugou was going to get to the bottom of it.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">***</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b> <em>Reason #56 to Die: It\u2019s 2 a.m.</em> </b>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<b> <em>I wonder if Denki is playing Mario Kart.</em> </b>\n</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong> <em> Reason #26 to Live: Someone spray-painted \u201cRed Riot\u201d on one of the walls downtown.

His shirt, a new addition to his hero costume, really had done its job of keeping the cold out. One of the support kids had made it for him out a kevlar; tearing would be minimal.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The day was nice, birds chipping the trees above the training ground. He felt calm here, surrounded by nature instead of people. Sure, in a few minutes, he would have to spar with someone, but it didn\u2019t really bother him. Kirishima knew he couldn\u2019t pick the usual four he\u2019d go with, which was fine. There were plenty of others he could choose from.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em> Like they\u2019d want to fight with someone so weak. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kirishima\u2019s shoulders dropped at the voice in his head\u2019s presence. Of course, the bastard couldn\u2019t let him have one good moment.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em> Well, I am you. So really, you just hate yourself. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Shut up, Kirishima thought, his mood significantly souring. He had been - mostly - fine this morning. He had put his fist through his mirror last night, and honestly, the absence of his reflection felt good.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>There was a lot of broken glass he would have to clean up, but it was better than having to look at himself.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Plus, he\u2019d gotten himself to eat food, which had also been a struggle for the past few days. His depression had kept him tied to the bed every second he wasn\u2019t in school. However, he\u2019d managed to get out of bed this morning to get some cereal in him, and he was proud.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em> Proud? You did something every person alive does. How pathetic. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay class,\u201d Aizawa deadpanned, and Kirishima took comfort in the distraction, \u201cit\u2019s your third year here so you should know the drill. I\u2019m not going to baby you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He walked away, undeniably going somewhere to nap. Kirishima smiled fondly; it was good to see the little things hadn\u2019t changed.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Looking around for a partner, Kirishima surveyed the area. Tokoyami was with Shoji, and Koda and Sato had already split off. Not wanting to hurt his feelings, he refused to look at his old friends. He certainly wasn\u2019t going to ask Bakugou.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Unable to stop himself, he looked at the blonde.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He was stalking towards him, red eyes glued onto Kirishima\u2019s frame. Panicking, Kirishima looked around desperately for an escape. Did literally everyone else have a partner?</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cKirishima!\u201d He heard a bubbly voice from behind him, and he turned back to his savior. Ochako was bouncing towards him, \u201cLet\u2019s be partners!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Sighing thankfully, he nodded, \u201cFor sure!\u201d She waved him over, linking an arm around his bicep when he got close.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou finally put on a shirt!\u201d Ochako laughed and smiled brightly.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kirishima knew people would comment on the change, but it still threw him for a loop. He\u2019d added the shirt because he couldn\u2019t stand to look at his body anymore. Reflecting on it now, it was stupid for him to assume <em>anyone </em>had wanted to see him. There wasn\u2019t much to look at. Just an ugly boy with an ugly body.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat? Miss the six-pack?\u201d He said, smirking.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Ochako gasped overdramatically, \u201cNo! Of course not! I only want to look at my boyfriend's abs, Kirishima.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The never-ending feeling of loneliness sunk its needles into Kirishima\u2019s mouth, sewing it shut. He felt the churn of breakfast in his stomach, face pailing. Fingers vibrated with emotional exhaustion.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSpeaking of boyfriends,\u201d Ochako continued, oblivious to Kirishima\u2019s state, \u201cI tried to save you from Bakugou back there. What\u2019s got him all riled up?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kirishima shook his head, \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know?\u201d Ochako questioned, cocking her head. The hands on his bicep tightened some, \u201cHe tells you everything.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kirishima could feel his eyes water, lip quivering as he tried to push down the feeling. The black hole of doubt was eating away at his brain, \u201cHe\u2026 he hasn\u2019t spoken to me since last semester.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Ochako stopped walking, effectively pulling Kirishima backward, \u201cWhat?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>His shoulder sank, breathing becoming faster, \u201cI don\u2019t know what happened. One day we were best friends, then he left for Miruko\u2019s agency and\u2026 silence,\u201d Kirishima wiped at his eyes, laughing at his own patheticness, \u201cI think he-,\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>His eyes fell to the ground, watching the salt water fall to the dirt. It sucked it in like a sponge, erasing his sadness from the earth, \u201cI think Deku just became more important than me. Which is fine!\u201d He reassured, trying his best not to offend Ochako, \u201cHe\u2019s way more powerful than me; he\u2019s also more fun to be around so I get it. I just wish he would\u2019ve told me he didn\u2019t want to be friends anymore.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Ochako pulled away, setting a hand on each of Kirishima\u2019s shoulders, \u201cI mean he and Deku are better friends now, sure, but\u2026\u201d She shook her head, looking angry.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kirishima sunk into himself. He hadn\u2019t meant to upset her.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em> Can\u2019t you do anything right? </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>I\u2019m trying.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em> Not hard enough. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t deserve that,\u201d she finally said, thumbs rubbing kindly across the fabric of his shirt.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>In shock, Kirishima stared at her.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em> Yes, I did. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He couldn\u2019t remember the last time someone had said something so nice to him. Looking back, it had been over three months - excluding Ito, because that\u2019s his job. His parents hadn\u2019t taken very kindly to his attempt, constantly chastising him for adding another burden to their lives. It was only fair; he had added an entire list of things they had to do for him to their already growing ones. Kirishima understood why they were upset.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThanks,\u201d He said instead, giving her his best smile.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI will be talking to him later,\u201d She said, finishing it with a \u201chmph.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kirishima sighed, knowing better than to argue with her. She continued her steady walking for only a moment before turning back, an odd look of understanding on her face, \u201cBy the way, I do <em>kinda </em>miss the abs. I think a lot of people do.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He smirked, chasing after her.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kirishima was just happy to finally talk with someone who felt familiar.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">***</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re in a bad mood,\u201d Deku said, dodging a blast from behind. He was much faster than he used to be, moving so quickly Bakugou couldn\u2019t keep up.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He growled, blasting himself into the air to attempt a downward-facing explosion, \u201cNo shit!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Deku simply jumped out of the way again, propelling himself upwards. He kicked Bakugou hard in the chest, sending him crashing into the ground.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bakugou laid there, absent of any air from his lungs. Stunned, he rolled onto his side. He tried his best to take in a breath, shuddering under the weight of the action.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>A red shoe dug itself into his temple, \u201cI win.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bakugou grumbled, swatting at the shoes while wheezing, \u201cI was distracted.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd now your face is in the ground,\u201d He laughed, removing his foot, \u201cCome on Kacchan, what\u2019s up with you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bakugou pulled himself up, hand on his chest, \u201cNothing.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Deku frowned, arching an eyebrow, \u201c<em> Sure</em>. You lost and you\u2019re not even a little upset. You\u2019re beating yourself up over something.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cStop psychoanalyzing me, you fucking weirdo!\u201d Bakugou yelled, trying his best to stand. Coughing, he managed to pull himself onto his feet. He turned his head at the sound of bubbly giggling.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Ochako was sending boulders into Kirishima, who was having a fucking ball splintering them into a dozen pieces.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He looked at his friend - could he still call him that? - absorbing the sight of him in a shirt. Something about it felt violently wrong, like all the confidence from before was buried somewhere under that polyester.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bakugou had never seen Kirishima look so unsure.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It was like he was constantly waiting for an enemy to appear over the horizon. It was pissing Bakugou off, the constant doubt Kirishima seemed to wear like a pair of handcuffs.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cKirishima is avoiding me,\u201d He said finally, glancing at his friend.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Deku nodded, gesturing to the two, \u201cHe seems like he\u2019s in a better mood than the first day,\u201d he handed Bakugou a water bottle, \u201cso it must just be you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHuh?\u201d Bakugou questioned, snatching the bottle, \u201cWhat about me?!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat bullshit did you pull this time to make him mad at you?\u201d Deku said, staring at him in mild disinterest.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bakugou looked away, huffing, \u201cI-,\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Guilt set heavy in his guts, tongue buzzing with a horrible noise as his throat contracted. Sighing, his fist bunched up tightly. \u201cI didn\u2019t do it on purpose,\u201d he muttered.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Deku let out a disappointed breath, \u201cDoesn\u2019t matter.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bakugou thought back to the voicemail on his phone he refused to listen to. Missed texts and phone calls swirled around his mind as his palms crackled with frustration.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThis summer,\u201d he said, eyes focused on dirt, \u201cwhen we were looking into All for One,\u201d he cleared his throat, trying to relieve the tension, \u201cI didn\u2019t talk to him. I didn\u2019t answer his calls or his texts. Not once the entire summer.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>There was a moment of silence before Deku spoke, \u201cKacchan.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bakugou moved to face him, only to hear a solid crack as his head snapped sideways. It took a minute for his brain to catch up to the fact that he\u2019d been slapped.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you an idiot!?!\u201d Deku said, grabbing him by the shoulders. Bakugou tried to focus on the words as he was shoved back and forth, \u201cYou didn\u2019t talk to him once? He\u2019s ignoring you because you\u2019re an asshole!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bakugou was not used to this kind of treatment. Normally, Deku would say something kinda pissy about his bad actions and they\u2019d move on. This reaction, all anger and heart, was different than usual</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s been your friend since our first year and you throw him away over one summer! What could\u2019ve possibly crawled into your brain and eaten so much of it that you came up with this decision?!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI was trying to protect him,\u201d Bakugou said, grabbing Deku back.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s going to be a Pro Hero too, Bakugou!\u201d\u00a0<em>Not the first name</em>. Damn, he really was mad, \u201cKirishima is perfectly capable of taking care of himself!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean I can\u2019t try to keep him out of danger!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cBy completely shutting him out?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat else was I supposed to do?!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHe probably thinks you hate him!\u201d Deku screamed, pushing Bakugou to the ground. The blonde hit the dirt, sprawling out onto his back.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The world spun around him as he contemplated the sentence. That was impossible, right? There was no way Kirishima thought Bakugou hated him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>But, then again\u2026</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Sure, Kirishima had moved his desk to get away from Denki, Sero, and Mina, but he\u2019d hadn\u2019t tried to stay close to Bakugou either. Kirishima's texts had stopped halfway through the summer, and when Bakugou had tried to partner with him earlier, Kirishima had been looking everywhere for an escape.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you really think that?\u201d Bakugou said, looking absolutely crestfallen, \u201cThat he thinks that I hate him?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Deku sighed, putting his hands on his knees, \u201cI would. I would probably hate you back for leaving me in the dark.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bakugou stared up at the sky, watching the swirling clouds as he tried to sort out his thoughts. He had known that not talking to Kirishima had been a dick move, but he thought maybe, somehow, they could fix their relationship when he returned.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI thought\u2026 I thought we could fix it after I got back,\u201d Bakugou said.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou were just going to take advantage of the fact that he cares about you,\u201d Deku sighed, \u201cIf I were him, I would\u00a0<em>absolutely</em>\u00a0hate you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bakugou bit his lips, eyes wide as Deku stood above him, \u201cYou need to apologize, and maybe,\u00a0<em>just maybe</em>, he might forgive you. If he doesn\u2019t,\u201d Deku reached a hand out to him, \u201cyou kinda deserve it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bakugou took the hand, being lifted off the ground with an easy swoop. Heels dug deep into the dirt, he huffed, \u201cI really fucked up, didn\u2019t I?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Deku said, patting his back, \u201cYou really did. You have time to fix it though.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He nodded, thinking about all the things he needed to do to make this up to Kirishima.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">***</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kirishima walked through the hall, steadying his breathing. His legs felt shaky as he made his way back to the dorms. Thinking about training earlier, he cringed. It was so obvious how far behind he had fallen. Aizawa should\u2019ve suspended him right there.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He\u2019d gotten caught up in the joy of being with a friend and had completely forgotten to actually practice. How stupid of him; Ochako deserved better than to train with him. She shouldn\u2019t have been stuck with such a weak, unfocused bastard.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He turned the corner, still muttering insults under his breath, and hit a wall.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Well, it wasn\u2019t a wall, it was a person, and that person was holding his waist tight, keeping him somewhat upright. Looking up, his vision was filled with blonde eyebrows and red eyes.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Neither of them spoke, Kirishima\u2019s hands on Bakugou\u2019s shoulders. He could feel the embarrassment heating his cheeks.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Ripping himself away, he fell back, \u201cSorry! I\u2019m so sorry! I was just trying to go back to the dorms; I didn\u2019t mean to bother you!\u201d He put his head down, trying his best not to taint Bakugou with his gaze</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Quickly, he tried to leave, only to be grabbed by the wrist. Wincing, he pulled it away, arms stinging.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWait, Kirishima,\u201d Bakugou pleaded, hands still out like he wanted to touch him, \u201cI\u2026 I need to talk to you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He paused, turning around slowly, looking extremely guilty. Bakugou's heart panged, remorse pulsing through him. God, he had really messed up.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cListen, Kiri, about this summer,\u201d Bakugou sucked in a breath, \u201cI-.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<strong> Why am I not saying it? Spit it out! </strong>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI was working all summer with Miruko and Deku. We were hunting down the really powerful villain, and it took up all my time.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<strong> No, that\u2019s not what I was trying to say. </strong>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd I was trying my best to make sure no one else got hurt.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<strong> Tell him you\u2019re sorry!\u00a0 </strong>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI cut you off because I was afraid you\u2019d end up dead if you stayed around me. That\u2019s all.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<strong> You motherfucker. You stupid motherfucker. </strong>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He looked at Kirishima expectantly, mind a mass of white noise. He watched in horror as regret consumed Kirishima\u2019s face \u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cBakugou, I\u2019m so sorry. I shouldn\u2019t have bothered you why you were doing something so important.\u201d Kirishima grabbed Bakugou's wrist, eyes sickeningly dull, \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to get in the way. Please forgive me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bakugou\u2019s hands went up in shock, and when his brain finally caught up, he set them on his friends' shoulders.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<strong> You didn\u2019t do anything wrong! </strong>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s ok,\u201d Bakugou choked out, kicking himself mentally.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThank you. I won\u2019t do it again.\u201d Kirishima said, pulling away.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<strong> What? </strong>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Bakugou questioned, thrown off by the answer.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kirishima let go of him entirely, \u201cI won\u2019t get in the way of your hero missions.\u00a0I\u2019ll be sure not to bother you anymore.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s not what I said,\u201d Bakugou protested, trying to reassure Kirishima, \u201cI-,\u201d he looked away, \u201cI want to be friends again.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kirishima didn\u2019t say anything, staring hard at the other. They stayed in the awkwardness for a moment.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bakugou was taken aback, mouth falling open softly, \u201cWhat do you mean \u2018why?\u2019\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kirishima gave him a smile that looked so unnaturally sad, \u201cWhy would you want to be friends with me after I almost messed up this summer for you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bakugou sighed, \u201cNo, Kirishima. You didn\u2019t ruin anything I-,\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, I did,\u201d He said, \u201cWhy do you think me and the others aren\u2019t friends anymore? It\u2019s because I\u2019m a bad person,\u201d Kirishima said, sounding far too honest.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s not-,\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to drag you down with me. I\u2019ll ruin you like I ruin everything else,\u201d Kirishima responded, voice rising. Anger and sadness boiled like an overflowing pot of water on a stovetop deep in his bones, \u201cI\u2019m bad for you. I\u2019m bad for everyone. You should stay away from me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to do that,\u201d Bakugou said, grabbing Kirishima\u2019s wrists again, trying his best to be careful.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Even the soft press burned white-hot and Kirishima grimaced. Bakugou didn\u2019t let go, \u201cAre you listening to me? You\u2019re not bad! I want to be friends, Kirishima.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kirishima sniffled, eyes closed as he tried to ignore the pain, \u201cOkay, okay. We can be friends.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bakugou looked down at his wrist, noticing small dots of red leaking through the fabric. Panicking, he let go, \u201cWhat the fuck?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kirishima also turned his eyes to the blood, pulling his arms away, \u201cMust be from training!\u201d He spat out, excuse coming out in full confidence, \u201cI didn\u2019t know I\u2019d even been scratched!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He laughed as Bakugou stared at him, completely confused. Something felt extremely off about the whole situation.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAnyways,\u201d Kirishima said, far too loud, \u201cI need to go. Goodbye!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bakugou was at a loss for words as his friend walked away, almost in a full sprint.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">***</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kirishima sat on his bedroom floor, crying softly as he wrapped the bandages over the splinters in the scabs.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He hadn\u2019t relapsed in a couple of days, and he had been proud of himself.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The trickling blood only served as a reminder about how incredibly fucked up he was. He could barely see through the tears, fingers trembling harshly as he tried his best to seal up the wounds.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">***</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<strong> <em> Reason #68 to Die: I went back to look at the spray-paint.\u00a0 </em> </strong>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<strong> <em> Someone drew an X over it and put the word \u201clame\u201d instead. </em> </strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong> <em> Reason #12 to Live: Bakugou wants to be friends again.

Kirishima wouldn\u2019t have known it existed had it not been for hide and seek last year; they\u2019d played it during a class-wide sleepover. He, Denki, and Bakugou had all snuck in there to hide, Bakugou had been dragged along by Kirishima.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He slammed a fist into the side of his head, scratching his temple slightly as he mentally kicked himself. He spent all those years dragging Bakugou along on things he didn\u2019t want to do. What a shitty friend.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Why couldn\u2019t he just leave people who weren\u2019t interested alone? It\u2019s like he had to be a nuisance to everyone around him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em> That\u2019s why people stopped liking you. It\u2019s because you\u2019re annoying. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kirishima groaned, setting his head on his knees.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em> Look at you, sitting alone at lunch while everyone else hangs out with their friends. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The grip on his hair tightened, fingers digging into his scalp. His whole body felt painfully numb, ears ringing with a neverending buzz; it was like a wasp had crawled in his ear canal.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Crying softly, he sunk back against the wall, eyes burning from the tears invading them. His hands were hardened and it was taking everything in him not to slam them into the concrete.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cKirishima?\u201d Ochako said, her kind voice drifting into the corner he was shoved into. Kirishima stood up completely straight, wiping at his eyes as he tried to compose himself.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cY-Yes?\u201d He stuttered out, waiting for her to appear around the corner. She did, holding a bento box full of food.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Ochako looked extremely concerned; her lips were drawn in tight together as she looked him over, \u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He opened his mouth to say something, only to feel the familiar closing of his throat as he choked on the words. He attempted to wave his hand instead, coughing hard on the rocks in his throat.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It seemed the sobs were inevitable.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><em> No one has asked if I\u2019m okay in </em> <strong> <em>so </em> </strong> <em>long. </em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Ochako started towards him, wrapping him tight into a hug. Kirishima collapsed into her, holding on for dear life as he broke. She was patient with him, brushing her fingers through his hair, \u201cYeah, I thought so,\u201d She looped her arms around his shoulders, still massaging his scalp, \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He wanted so desperately to tell her, to tell anyone really. The words, however, were buried somewhere deep in his brain, refusing to dislodge themselves. Instead, he shook his head against her sternum, the tears continuing.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>She hummed, pulling away just some, \u201cKirishima, did you find out about what happened at lunch today?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kirishima furrowed his brows in confusion as she brushed the tears away with her sleeve, \u201cWhat?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Ochako grimaced, looking away, \u201cAbout Mina?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Still confused, he rasped, \u201cDid she say something?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Ochako sighed, grabbing his face, \u201cListen, before I tell you this, you have to believe me when I say everyone was disgusted with her. It was a shit show after I left. Everyone was screaming at one another and I-,\u201d she gulped, nervousness swallowing her features.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kirishima nodded, gripping her arms tight.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, she was talking about this summer, mostly about how she confessed and all that. She said you were super mean about rejecting her, and I told her that didn\u2019t seem like you at all,\u201d Ochako seemed to breathe out her anger, \u201cthen, she\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>She started to tear up as well, eyes glued to the ceiling, \u201cThen, she told everyone you were gay.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kirishima stared in shock, heart falling through the chasm of his chest and collapsing into his stomach, \u201cShe\u2026 What?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry, Kirishima! Mina just kept talking; it was like she couldn\u2019t stop. I started yelling at her so maybe she\u2019d get mad at me instead of you. Then, Bakugou jumped in and things got really messy,\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em> Bakugou had defended him. Why? </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Ochako said, hugging him again, \u201cI realized you weren\u2019t there and I came to find you. Last I heard, Midoriya and Bakugou were screaming at her pretty loud.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Ochako sniffled, \u201cIt\u2019s like she\u2019s an entirely different person. She wasn\u2019t like this at all last year. Mina gets mad at everything; she\u2019ll jump on you for any little mistake. I think you just happen to be her biggest target.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kirishima was too tired to say anything, arms dangling freely as he simply leaned his head into his friend\u2019s shoulder, \u201cWhy do they hate me?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>She inhaled sharply, air broken up into segments, \u201cOh, Kirishima, I\u2019m sure that\u2019s not true. Even if she does, if Denki and Sero do too, I don\u2019t. So many of us love you so much.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em> Liar.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI mean it. You\u2019re friends with so many people.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em> She\u2019s lying. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWe care about you so much. Everyone was so mad at her.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em> She\u2019s lying so you\u2019ll stop talking to her. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve been so worried about you. You look so sad all the time and it\u2019s killing me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em> Look what you\u2019ve done. You made someone worry about you, and for what? Attention? Pity? You\u2019re disgusting. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re one of my best friends Kirishima. I like having you around. You\u2019re really great company, and you deserve better than this.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em> Kill yourself. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em> You\u2019re a burden. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em> Making people worry. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em> Disgusting. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em> Ugly. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em> Look at her, she\u2019s crying. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em> This is your fault. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em> Everything is your fault. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI know,\u201d He said, wrapping his arms around her in return.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He didn\u2019t really know which one of them he was talking to.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Ochako stood in front of him, hugging him close as he regained control of himself. Once the sniffles stopped, she pulled back, \u201cI hope you know none of us care that you\u2019re gay. I\u2019m sorry you didn\u2019t get to tell us when you were ready though.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kirishima chuckled, wiping his own eyes this time, \u201cI think it\u2019s sadder that none of you even questioned it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Ochako turned red, \u201cWell, I mean\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s okay,\u201d He said, smiling.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em> Don\u2019t let her know. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s kinda funny actually,\u201d He reassured, and she giggled.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m glad,\u201d She let go of him entirely, and he realized how long it had been since he'd hugged someone, \u201cAnyways, Bakugou packed you a lunch. I think it\u2019s his piss-poor way of apologizing.\u201d She grabbed the bento box from off the floor and handed it to him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kirishima accepted it, opening it to see three pieces of wagyu sushi, along with some sesame noodles. There were two taiyakis pinned down by a toothpick with a small shark on top of it.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI gave him the toothpick,\u201d Ochako said, pulling it out slowly. She wiped it off with her sleeve, waving off Kirishima\u2019s attempts at protest. The pick now clean, she tucked it behind his ear, \u201cThere you go! It suits you!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kirishima laughed, removing the chopsticks as he did so, \u201cI\u2019m glad you think so.\u201d He drove straight for the sushi, finally filling his empty stomach. Ochako sat beside him, setting her head on his shoulder as he ate.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI understand more than you think,\u201d Ochako said as he dug into the noodles. She twiddled her fingers idly, frowning some, \u201cIzuku pulled away a lot this summer too. We still kept in contact, for sure, but he was distant sometimes. I always felt like\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou were being left in the dark?\u201d Kirishima supplied, looking at her.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d She sighed, \u201cbut Bakugou, he knows everything. I can tell. They have all this inside knowledge on each other and I just feel\u2026 excluded.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kirishima nodded, mouth full, \u201cIt\u2019s just hard to make yourself fit in their dynamic because they know\u00a0<em> everything </em>\u00a0about each other.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Ochako swung her legs back and forth over the small ledge they were sat on. Her eyes picked with small tears as she laughed softly, \u201cIt\u2019s impossible. They laugh over all these inside jokes and stuff and I just can\u2019t keep up. But what am I supposed to do, stop them from being friends? They just fixed their relationship.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kirishima knocked her shoulder lightly, \u201cTo be fair, you have a piece of him Bakugou doesn\u2019t. He loves you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>In the silence, they could both hear the echo of what Kirishima hadn\u2019t said.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em> I don\u2019t have that piece of Bakugou. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Ochako wiped her nose, \u201cI\u2019m sorry! I just made this all about me, huh?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s okay!\u201d Kirishima insisted, chopsticks still in hand, \u201cIt\u2019s nice to know someone gets it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>They smiled at each other, a sense of understanding flowing through them both.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, it is.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">***</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bakugou stomped through the hall, anger flowing harshly through him. He looked down at his bloody knuckles, skin burned away in spots. He hadn\u2019t meant to get in a fight with that pink bitch, but when she\u2019d said that; when she <em>outed </em>his best friend to everyone. He couldn\u2019t stop himself.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>So yeah, he and Mina had gotten into a shoving match; her acid might\u2019ve gotten on his hands, what about it?</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It burned,\u00a0<em> fuck </em>\u00a0it burned like hell. Bakugou refused to let it show, simply trying to hunt down his friend. He didn\u2019t know how he was supposed to tell him without the other getting upset.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He walked through the open doorway that led to the stairwell, ears open for any sign of Kirishima.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThey have all this inside knowledge on each other and I just feel\u2026 excluded.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Was that Ochako? He had noticed her absence after Aizawa had split the two of them up.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He growled, thinking about the detention he had received. It was such bullshit; suddenly standing up for your friend isn\u2019t allowed?</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kirishima\u2019s voice followed. \u201cIt\u2019s just hard to make yourself fit in their dynamic because they know\u00a0<em> everything </em>\u00a0about each other.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<strong> Who was this about? </strong>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s impossible. They laugh over all these inside jokes and stuff and I just can\u2019t keep up. But what am I supposed to do, stop them from being friends? They just fixed their relationship.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<strong> Is this about me and Deku? </strong>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cTo be fair, you have a piece of him Bakugou doesn\u2019t. He loves you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The silence that followed was deafening. Bakugou tried to take in the emotions that lay in the space, but he couldn\u2019t. The two that were hiding from him had always been better at that stuff than he had been. His lacking emotional intelligence made him feel like an intruder, so he left.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He backed out of the doorway, walking himself to the dorms. Something felt so heavy in him; it was like the silence had grabbed a hold of him and latched itself into his bones.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bakugou just wished he could understand why it was happening.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">***</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kirishima had finally managed to leave his little nook, almost an hour after Ochako had left. Now, he was here, sunk deep into his pillows. He held his Crimson Riot plush close. Maybe it was childish to have a plush at 18, but it was one of the few things that brought him comfort anymore.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He hugged it close, tears falling softly from his eyes.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em> You ate so much for lunch today. No wonder you\u2019ve gotten fat. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>That\u2019s not true. Even if it was, it\u2019s not a big deal.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em> Yes, it is. How can you be a hero if you\u2019re ugly? </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>I\u2019m not ugly.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em> You\u2019re disgusting. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Shut up.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em> Pig. Revolting. Burden. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kirishima started to heave, the weight of his thoughts enough to make him sick. He watched tears fall to the hardwood floor.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em> You should slip on it. Maybe you\u2019ll split your head open and die. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t even make sense,\u201d Kirishima groaned, trying to fight against the irrationality. He was still leaning over the side of his bed, breathing in deep and slow.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cKirishima,\u201d He heard Bakugou's voice through the door, \u201cWho the fuck are you talking to?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kirishima went rigid, falling off the bed as he was startled. He landed with a loud thump.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cKirishima!\u2019 Bakugou said, sounding a bit nervous, \u201cOpen the fucking door please.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kirishima tried to pull himself up, crawling about halfway to the entrance before being able to do so. Attempting to appear normal, he opened the door, \u201cHey Bakugou. What\u2019s up?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bakugou looked him up and down, and Kirishima realized he was wearing a t-shirt. Feeling extremely naked, he wrapped his arms behind his back.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bakugou growled, pushing through the doorway, \u201cWe\u2019re hanging out.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It was a statement, not a question. Kirishima followed after him, looking visibly uncomfortable, \u201cI\u2019m really tired. Let\u2019s push it back, yeah?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSchool literally just ended. You weren\u2019t even there for the last half,\u201d Bakugou said, the words laced with a questioning tone.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Was this an interrogation? Kirishima began to pull back.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not asking for details, Shi-,\u201d Bakugou stopped himself, sighing, \u201cKirishima. Look, I just want to hang out with you for a little bit. You can kick me out in ten minutes just,\u201d He looked up at Kirishima, scrunching his face up for a moment before cracking open his eyes, \u201cCan we <em>please </em>hang out.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kirishima was dead, wasn\u2019t he? He really had slipped on his own tears and split his head open and died.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Kirishima said, eyes wide.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bakugou growled and began to take off his hoodie.\u00a0<em> What the fuck was happening?\u00a0 </em>Kirishima felt like the room was spinning at a hundred miles an hour. He tried his best to ground himself.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHere,\u201d He said gruffly, holding the hoodie up, \u201cYou look so fucking uncomfortable right now. I don\u2019t know why you\u2019re hiding your goddamn arms or whatever, but I\u2019m sick of looking at it,\u201d He gestured it out again, \u201cPut it on so you\u2019ll stop being so awkward.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bakugou huffed, seeming to hate his own statement, \u201cI mean\u2026 so you\u2019ll be more comfortable or some fucking bullshit; take the fucking hoodie!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kirishima started to reach for it, pulling back under Bakugou\u2019s gaze. Suddenly, the blonde looked up at the ceiling and Kirishima took the hoodie. Pulling it over his head, he took in the heavy scent of caramel.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It was soft against Kirishima\u2019s <em>ruined </em>skin.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><em> Ruined </em>skin.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Skin.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He shook his head, smiling, \u201cThank you, Bakugou.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He rumbled, throwing his hand forward, \u201cWhatever, don\u2019t worry about it.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kirishima noticed then the Switch Bakugou had with him, \u201cDo you wanna play something?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bakugou looked him over before walking over to the bed. He sat on it, leaning back entirely as he kicked his shoes off. Kirishima watched, confusion eating at him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou look tired,\u201d Bakugou said, adjusting himself so he lay in the middle of the bed, blonde hair on the pillows, \u201cso I won\u2019t make you lose against me in Mario Kart.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kirishima rolled his eyes, walking closer, \u201cOkay? What are we doing instead?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bakugou tapped the side of his chest lightly, \u201cLay down and take a nap. I\u2019ll be your stupid fucking pillow instead.\u201d He looked away, embarrassment on his face, \u201cLast year at that class sleepover, you kept talking about how it was easier to sleep when someone else was there. So here I am.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kirishima bit the inside of his cheek, careful not to draw blood, \u201cReally? You\u2019ll let me do that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDamnit Kiri,\u201d he bit, sitting up, \u201cI said it\u2019s fine. I\u2019m trying to be\u2026 nicer to you. Can you just accept the offer or kick me out?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He trembled some, the yelling throwing him back to a different time. Bakugou\u2019s eyes widened as he watched Kirishima shake in discomfort, possibly even fear, \u201cFuck.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He started to get off the bed, \u201cI keep fucking this up. I\u2019ll go, ok?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNo!\u201d Kirishima grabbed him by the shoulders, keeping him down on the mattress. They both exchanged gazes as Kirishima started to still, \u201cStay, please. Everything is quiet when you\u2019re here.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bakugou cocked his head in confusion, \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d He asked softly.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kirishima pushed him back down, \u201cUh, nothing! Just trust me!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bakugou didn\u2019t move for a moment, but began to readjust himself on the bed, Switch in his left hand as he did so. Kirishima crawled next to him, setting his head down on Bakugou\u2019s chest. They both laid together, far too stiff to enjoy.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Then, Bakugou picked up his Switch - had his hands been bandaged this whole time? - holding it above both of them so that Kirishima could watch. He booted up Stardew Valley, and Kirishima smiled, letting out a huff.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t you dare laugh,\u201d Bakugou said, but Kirishima could notice the small uptick in his voice. He settled against Bakugou, arm extending over his chest. Bakugou relaxed, sinking into Kirishima's hair.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWho did you marry?\u201d Kirishima asked, and Bakugou turned to him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAlex,\u201d he said, his character walking into the kitchen.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kirishima chuckled, \u201cA man after my own heart!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>If he had looked up, Kirishima could\u2019ve seen the spread of red across his cheeks, \u201cYeah. Something like that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kirishima closed his eyes, surrounded by the warmth of his friend as the clicking noises dragged him into sleep.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bakugou continued to play, heart beating like a snare drum as he watched the boy beside him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">***</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<strong> <em> Reason #4 to Die: My mom told me to slow down while eating today.

His body ached everywhere, his neck screaming with pain as he rolled over, hoping to find some warmth.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>There was none.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He felt his hand around the place Bakugou had been laying the night before, the sheets cold and abandoned. Something in his chest squeezed tight, air stolen from him as he took in the silence of the room.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He was alone.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em> Why would he stay? </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kirishima groaned, sitting up in an attempt to crush down the voice. The neverending dialogue continued.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em> You let him in and look at what happened. He got scared and ran away. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em> You\u2019re broken. Used. Look at you. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kirishima\u2019s core was white-hot, angry, and violent. He began to shake from the emotion, sharp teeth grinding against one another. Actions carried by nothing else than rage, he grabbed his pillow and tore at it, shredding through the stuffing with his hardened fingers.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He looked like a toddler throwing a tantrum - which was stupid because he was an adult. He didn\u2019t feel like an adult though.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He felt just like he did when his dad threw him in the deep end of the pool when he was four. When the cold water had touched his skin, he had gasped for air, only to take in a lung-full of water. Sure, he figured out how to swim pretty quickly after that; but why did he almost have to die just to learn how to float?</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kirishima felt like he couldn\u2019t breathe.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Sitting in the labor of his episode, Kirishima grabbed fistfuls of cotton. Wheezing, he folded into himself, crying softly as the embarrassment of fit caught up to him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He collapsed on his side, tears falling down his cheeks; his body felt incredibly stiff.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><em> How are you supposed to be a hero when you\u2019re like </em> <strong><em>this? </em> </strong></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Groaning, he grabbed at his hair.

He felt bad leaving Kirishima alone - something was obviously wrong with him - but he could tell that he hadn\u2019t been eating, and he was determined to fix that.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cKacchan?\u201d He heard, looking up to see Deku standing in the kitchen\u2019s doorway, \u201cWhat are you making?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He grumbled, \u201cSome steak for Kirishima.\u201d The knife made quick work of the vegetables as Bakugou kept up his speed, unaffected by his friend\u2019s presence. Deku hummed, taking a seat at the table.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy isn\u2019t he down here with you?\u201d Deku asked, yawning.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSleeping in,\u201d Bakugou said curtly, putting the onions in the skillet. The steak came next. Preferably, he would\u2019ve made it on a grill, but he didn\u2019t have time for that right now. Sighing, he leaned against the counter, \u201cDeku.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Deku looked up to him, but Bakugou kept his eyes on the steak, \u201cYeah?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSomething\u2019s wrong with him. I\u2019m not crazy, right?\u201d Bakugou asked, focused on the bubbling oil.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Deku didn\u2019t say anything for a moment, clearly thinking hard. Then, he let out a breath, \u201cYeah. Yeah, there is.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bakugou closed his eyes, grimacing at the confirmation. He leaned fully on his arms, hands gripping the granite countertop hard. He kicked the wood underneath the stove lightly.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIzuku.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Deku's eyes widened, completely baffled by the use of his real name, \u201cKacchan?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He turned, Deku taking in the sight of his friend. The bags under his eyes were intense, lips turned into a harsh scowl. He could see the pinprick of tears in red eyes.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m worried about him.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Taken aback, Deku stood up, \u201cKacchan.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He turned away with a growl, \u201cForget it. It\u2019s whatever. I\u2019ll figure it out.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cKatsuki!\u201d Deku insisted, walking over to the blonde, \u201cYou\u2019re right to be worried. I\u2019m worried about him too.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bakugou let out a bitter chuckle, slamming his fist on the counter, \u201cHow am I supposed to fix this? He was perfectly fine last year. I ghost him for an entire summer like a fucking idiot, and\u00a0<em> I\u2019m </em>the one upset. I couldn\u2019t be more of a selfish bastard. Why do I fuck everything up?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Deku shook his head, resting a scarred hand on Bakugou shoulder, \u201cYou figured out how to fix our relationship and - not to make it a competition - you screwed ours up a lot worse,\u201d He reassured, unfazed by Bakugou shoving his hand off, \u201cAlso, to be fair, I don\u2019t think this has to do so much with you as it has to do with Mina.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>They could both feel the lingerings of hate course through the room at the mention of the name, \u201cSo, maybe you can start there. There\u2019s got to be more to this than just a rejection.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bakugou cursed under his breath, \u201cAs if anything could give her the right to-,\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say that,\u201d Deku said, cutting him off, \u201cI\u2019m just saying they seem to hate each other now. Maybe, if you can get her to apologize, or at least back-off, you can fix the worst of it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bakugou nodded, flipping the steak again, \u201cYeah... maybe.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>They both set in the silence, that quiet understanding palpable between the both of them.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, I have to go. I promised Ochako I\u2019d go on a lunch date with her,\u201d Deku grabbed a strawberry from underneath Bakugou, \u201cYou want to hang out later?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bakugou thought it over, before turning to him, \u201cNo,\u201d He relived the quiet conversation he\u2019d overheard underneath the stairs, \u201cYou should spend the day with her. She deserves it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Deku cocked his head, before nodding, \u201cYeah, you\u2019re right. Then I\u2019ll see you tomorrow Kacchan,\u201d He took a bite of the strawberry as he waved behind him, \u201cTell Kirishima I say hi!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bakugou scoffed, smirking softly as he finished up the steak.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">***</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kirishima was awoken from his own head by knocking on his door. He didn\u2019t say anything at first, afraid that anyone would see the mess that he - and his room - were at the moment.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The knocks came again, \u201cKirishima, can I come in?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He looked at the door weakly, hands clutching the sheets.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He could hear the sigh from the other side of the door, \u201cI\u2019m coming in.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The door opened with a creak as Kirishima buried his head into the mattress. Tuning out the world, he could hear the buzzing of words but none of the meaning.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>There was a hand on his shoulder shaking him softly; he didn\u2019t move. Then, there was a hand sliding across his face, picking it up with care. Afraid to open his eyes or mouth, embarrassment inevitable if he did so, he pinched his trembling lips together.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cKiri, can you answer me? Please?\u201d Bakugou said, sitting on the bed next to him, \u201cI- I don\u2019t know what to do to make this better,\u201d He rasped, setting his head down on his lap, hands trailing through his hair.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kirishima shattered into a million unmendable pieces, reaching out to clutch Bakugou\u2019s shirt, \u201cYou can\u2019t. Nothing can.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>As Bakugou held his head tight, watching in the most agonizing helplessness, he reflected on a different time.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kirishima\u2019s room had always been a safe space; a place anyone could go to find solace. He could see the extra set of headphones Kirishima kept around from Jirou tucked into his penholder. Sero\u2019s copy of that manga they had been reading sat on the top shelf. Mina's butterfly clips were strewn out by his Crimson Riot figures. Denki\u2019s old charger; Deku\u2019s page on Kirishima\u2019s quirk, a keychain from Tokoyami, and cookbook Sato had given him all had their own place in his room.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He looked up the corkboard, littered with pictures of school trips and internships.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>And of them.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>A selfie he had been forced to take at the sport\u2019s festival, one of them the day they\u2019d gotten their hero costumes, Kirishima holding up their licenses together.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Through the oncoming tears, he could barely see the pictures anymore, but a final set caught his eyes.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It was them, four months ago on the last day of their second year. Kirishima was smiling, arm wrapped tight around Bakugou. His bright red hair stuck up in sharp spikes - fuck, he\u2019d almost forgotten what that looked like - and his eyes shined bright with an emotion Bakugou didn\u2019t think either of them could feel anymore.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>But Bakugou.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bakugou wasn\u2019t smiling. In fact, he looked incredibly angry; his nostrils were flared and his eyebrows furrowed. He was turned almost internally away like he was trying to escape the photo.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Then, next to it was a similar photo, almost exactly the same. Except now, Kirishima was glancing at him. His smile was almost gone, eyes duller than before. Somewhere behind the mess of crimson and fire, he could see the <em>hurt</em>.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bakugou looked down at the mess he'd made of the boy he once knew.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He looked so small, so lifeless and cold. Somehow, it was like Kirishima was already dead.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He pleaded, trying to get Kirishima to look at him, \u201cKirishima, it wasn\u2019t your fault.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, it was,\u201d he rasped, hiccupping on the words, \u201cIt\u2019s always me. I\u2019m always causing problems.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s not true!\u201d Bakugou said, smashing hard into Kirishima\u2019s emotional walls.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThen why does everyone leave!\u201d He cried, smashing a fist into his friend\u2019s chest. Caught off guard, Bakugou doubled over.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Before he knew it, they were wrestling. Kirishima tugged on him, yanking him back and forth as Bakugou tried to shoulder him away. They shoved at each other's faces, elbows and knees flying freely.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re a fucking dick!\u201d He screamed, hurling Bakugou into the mattress.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The blonde attempted to fight back, kicking at the other, \u201cKirishima, stop it!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy did you leave?\u201d He screamed, pulling Bakugou up by the shirt and slamming him back down, \u201cThis summer, this morning! Why do you always leave when I need you the most?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bakugou stared up at him, Kirishima\u2019s tears hitting his cheeks as they both panted from exhaustion; emotionally and physically. His shoulders were bunched as he kept a tight hold of Bakugou\u2019s collar, \u201cWhy does nobody ever stay?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kirishima collapsed against his friend\u2019s chest, body shaking under the sobs. Bakugou froze, body rocked by the shock of the moment.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kirishima was <strong><em>so </em></strong>tired. Empty from the fighting, the guilt; he was exhausted of never feeling like enough, \u201cI just want everything to end.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bakugou's hands shook, soft pops escaping him as the statement caught up to his brain, \u201cWhat?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He sat up, face and body corpse-like, \u201cNothing,\u201d he said, too tired to continue on his train of self-pity.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bakugou looked at his face, noticing the split in his lip, \u201cKirishima,\u201d he said, placing a hand on his cheek.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cStop pitying me,\u201d he growled, pulling away only a little.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat happened this summer wasn\u2019t your fault,\u201d Bakugou whispered.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, it was,\u201d Kirishima responded, eyes unseeing.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat happened this summer wasn\u2019t your fault,\u201d He repeated.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cStop lying.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat happened this summer wasn\u2019t your fault.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cStop it! I don\u2019t believe you!\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kirishima felt another hand on the other side of his face, trapped by warmth. He gazed down at Bakugou, only to see tears streaming down his temples and onto the ruins of the pillow, \u201cThen I\u2019ll keep saying it until you do.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kirishima shook his head, chest shaking with the pressure on his lungs, \u201cStop.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat happened this summer wasn\u2019t your fault.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cPlease, Bakugou,\u201d Kirishima whimpered, his entire weight held-up by those hands he had admired for so long.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>There was so much power contained in those palms. Right there on his fingertips lay a thousand fireworks. And yet, they cradled him so sweetly as he cracked like a mountain top under a volcanic explosion.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI was a shitty friend who ignored you because I was scared,\u201d He pulled down Kirishima\u2019s head into his shoulder, \u201cI\u2019m bad at this stuff but just know I-,\u201d He choked on the words, hugging Kirishima close, \u201cEijirou, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kirishima held him tight, rolling them both onto their sides as they scratched and clawed their way closer to each other.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>That severed ribbon was tied back together. Sure, it was sloppy and a little loose, but it would tighten over time, even if they yanked on it. It felt nice to have that tether, invisible or not, wrapped around their pinkies, everpresent.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>This hadn\u2019t <em>fixed </em>Kirishima, he didn\u2019t really think anything could at this point.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>But this ribbon, this rope, had tied some of the little pieces back to him. For now, that was enough.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry,\u201d Bakugou muttered, buried into Kirishima\u2019s chest.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d he admitted, fingers tightening into his shirt, \u201cI wasn\u2019t ever really mad. I forgave you a long time ago.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cGood,\u201d Bakugou coughed, pulling away, \u201cbecause I\u2019m not saying it again.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kirishima stared at him, smirking some as the pink crawled across the blonde\u2019s cheeks, nesting up on the top of his ears. There was this look on his face as he bit the inside of his mouth; remorse mixed with shyness.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to,\u201d he replied, wrapping their hands together. He brushed a kiss to the top of those important fingertips, \u201cI understand.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bakugou lit up like a firecracker, ripping his hand away as he sat straight up, \u201cI brought food.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kirishima chuckled at the awkwardness of the moment as Bakugou reached over to the bedside table. He held the plate over into view, the smell reaching Kirishima\u2019s nose.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Kirishima asked, leaning over the other\u2019s shoulder.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s a steak,\u201d He said, \u201cand you\u2019re lucky I wrapped it with foil or it would be cold by now.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kirishima accepted it, realizing just how hungry he was.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em> Disgusting. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He paused, the voice ringing out full force. Looking at the plate, he suddenly felt queasy.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em> Don\u2019t eat. Bad. Failure. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cKirishima,\u201d Bakugou said, snapping him from his trance, \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He shook his head, fingers trembling as he reached for the fork, \u201cM\u2019 fine.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bakugou\u2019s stomach churned with concern. Kirishima looked beyond pale, basically as white as the pillow stuffing that was still strewn around the room.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHey,\u201d he said, taking the knife, \u201cI didn\u2019t make this for you to waste.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He nodded, resting his head on Bakugou's shoulder. He cut him off a piece, feeding it to Kirishima before taking a slice for himself.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s good,\u201d Kirishima said, perking up some. He seemed more interested now.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bakugou almost made a comment about him talking with his mouth full, but stopped himself.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course it\u2019s good, I made it,\u201d he said instead. Kirishima hummed, starting to go at the steak by himself.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Smiling, Bakugou felt his nerves die down with the arrival of pride, and he wiped away the remaining tears on his friend's face.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kirishima grinned at him, looking a little shocked, \u201cMidoriya turned you into a softie.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bakugou\u2019s eyebrows dropped, \u201cNo, he didn\u2019t.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, he did!\u201d Kirishima laughed, eating the steak with fever now, \u201cYou spend one summer with the guy and come back like this? Don\u2019t get me wrong, I like it. You\u2019re still a hardass, which I like too!\u201d Kirishima said, throwing his hands up, \u201cbut you\u2019re a\u2026 softer hardass.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bakugou studied him, scowling. Then, he leaned in close to Kirishima, who paused his eating, \u201cI\u2019m not soft for anyone,\u201d his eyes darted away, \u201c... else.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kirishima was the one to blush this time, turning away as both of them hid from the moment.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>After a while, Kirishima turned back around. His lips quirked up, \u201cWell, I\u2019m glad\u2026 that it\u2019s just me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bakugou scrambled off the bed, stomping towards the door before Kirishima could get a word in. The door slammed, followed quickly by a repeat of the noise as Kirishima gnawed on the steak in confusion.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Suddenly, Bakugou appeared again, Switch held up in his hand.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cMove over.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kirishima happily obliged.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">***</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<strong> <em> Reason #19 to Die: I changed my official hero name to Riot today since I\u2019m not red anymore. </em> </strong>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<strong> <em> Not that I\u2019ll be needing it soon. </em> </strong>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<strong> <em> Reason #16 to Live: Bakugou drew a frowny face on my hand today while we were studying. </em> </strong>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<strong> <em> He smiled. </em> </strong>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\n<strong> *** </strong>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em> The porcelain was cold against his skin as he sunk into the bath, the faucet dripping slow. The splattering noise rang through Kirishima\u2019s ears. He noticed the red in the reflection of the water, hand coming up to his hair. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em> Where was he? </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em> Looking around, he noticed he was in his family\u2019s bathroom, though the door was missing and the walls were fuzzy, details absent. He tried his best to reach over to the handles, wanting to stop the dripping noise from continuing. He turned them to the right, knob tightening, but the flow of water worsened. Attempting the other direction, the water gushed out, filling up the already full tub. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em> His hand reached out to stop the flow, but when he caught sight of the red dripping into the water, he turned over his wrist. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em> Scars started to reopen, filling his sight with red as he tried desperately to stop the bleeding, but the cuts simply worsened. His skin peeled back as he attempted to take in a breath. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em> His lungs filled with water, and he realized he had been pulled under the surface.

Hurry up!\u201d Bakugou yelled, slamming his fist against the wood. Kirishima threw himself onto the floor, scrambling to the trash can as he emptied his guts.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tears stuck to his eyelashes as he looked at the back of his eyelids, a horrible red.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The doorknob jiggled, \u201cAy? You alright? Don\u2019t make me come in there.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kirishima wiped at his mouth furiously, panting like a rabid dog, \u201cI\u2019m good! Just give me a minute.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He would have loved to sit on the floor and contemplate life, but he was afraid his silence would cause Bakugou to come into his room, so he sat up instead. Pulling himself off the floor, he stumbled to a stance, hand gripping the bed.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cKirishima, seriously, are you alright?\u201d Bakugou asked, the concern palpable.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI said I\u2019m fine!\u201d Kirishima yelled, angry and bitter as the bad taste settled onto his tongue, \u201cJust give me one fucking minute!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bakugou didn\u2019t say anything, an awkward silence radiating through the room. Kirishima threw on some deodorant and changed his clothes, tossing the old ones into his overstuffed laundry basket. He brushed through his hair quickly, still a bit damp from the shower he managed to take last night.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Ruffling it up some, he stepped through the door, slipping his shoes on as he did so. Sighing, he looked up into the hallway, ready to head to the door.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bakugou leaned against the wall, looking downcast, red eyes dull as he rocked on his feet. Kirishima stared at him, mind churning with guilt.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em> He was just trying to be nice and you hurt his feelings. Can\u2019t you let anyone be happy? </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kirishima grimaced, walking towards his friend, \u201cHey, I\u2019m sorry man.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, it's alright,\u201d Bakugou rasped, kicking himself off the wall. His shoulders were sunken, pace lazy and slurred as he fell into line with Kirishima. They walked in quiet, Kirishima too angry at everything to attempt small talk as Bakugou tripping into silent remorse.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kirishima hated this, the disconnect between them that seemed to tear at the recently placed stitches that had brought them back together. Feeling the cracking rift in his chest, Kirishima looped a hand around Bakugou\u2019s wrist. He looked at him, startled by the action of reassurance. Kirishima\u2019s fingers dug into the soft skin right under the bone as he smiled sadly.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI had a nightmare,\u201d Kirishima whispered, letting go of his wrist.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bakugou grumbled, arms hovering in the space between him before he pulled it back into his pocket, \u201cYou could\u2019ve just told me that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI know. I\u2019m sorry for snapping at you,\u201d Kirishima sighed, knocking lightly into his shoulder. Bakugou straightened up a bit, smirking slightly.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The silence became more peaceful then, both boys feeling better after the kind interaction. They stepped onto the elevator, Kirishima pressed the button for the bottom floor. The descent was slow, and Kirishima cursed the budget shortcuts UA had taken.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHey,\u201d Bakugou mumbled, leaning his head against the cool metal of the elevator wall, \u201cyou can tell me about it. The nightmare.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kirishima hummed, glancing at him, \u201cNo, for once I don\u2019t think I can.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bakugou\u2019s breath hitched in this devastating way; it was as if he\u2019d just been shot in the chest, \u201cWhy?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kirishima turned away, begging the final floor to show itself.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you not trust me or something?\u201d Bakugou growled, that defensive edge reappearing. He didn\u2019t look angry, he looked like he was staring a particularly cruel death in the face.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>As the doors slid open, they were met by the blinding light in the entryway. Kirishima took in the brightness, sighing, \u201cNo. I don\u2019t. Not with this.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He stepped out, leaving a stunned Bakugou behind.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">***</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kirishima shifted uncomfortably in his seat, smashed between Ochako and Bakugou as they all ate. He felt like he was suffocating, eyes darting back and forth from one thigh to another, hands trembling as he tried to breathe.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The people around him were talking, but he wasn\u2019t hearing anything. It was just buzzing mummers with the occasional clear string of words.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cKiri!\u201d He heard, snapping his head upwards to face the noise. Jirou looked at him expectantly, as did the rest of the table. His chest tightened, air caught in the back of his throat as he clawed desperately through his mind to find out what he had been asked.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWho did you intern with this summer?\u201d Midoriya coaxed, and Kirishima sighed at the relief of knowing.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Then, the fear came again. He hadn\u2019t been an intern this summer; he\u2019d been in the hospital or kept locked up in his room the whole time. His parents and UA had been afraid he\u2019d \u201cdo something reckless\u201d if they let him be out on the field.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>What was he supposed to say now; that he\u2019d been too much of a danger to himself to be a hero? What a joke.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI didn\u2019t,\u201d Kirishima answered, and everyone stared him down. It was crushing, the number of eyes on him. Blood roared in his ears as his heart pounded; his tongue tasting of harsh copper as he realized he\u2019d bitten it.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Mina scoffed from the back, only to get elbowed by Sero as Kirishima ducked his head.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Iida lifted a hand, \u201cNot to pry, but why is that so?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Momo said, soft voice interjecting, \u201cAren\u2019t you afraid you\u2019ll\u00a0<strong> fall behind </strong>?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI-,\u201d Kirishima started, only to be cut off.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cEveryone worked with someone this summer, my friend,\u201d Tokoyami said, Dark Shadow hovering above him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cGuys, I\u2019m sure it\u2019s-\u201d Ochako tried.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Mineta slammed his hands on the table, sneering, \u201cYou get a hot girlfriend. Sorry,\u00a0<strong> boyfriend </strong>?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll kill you,\u201d Bakugou threatened, bringing up his palm, sparks flying.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI thought Gang Orca asked you to be his intern?\u201d Sato said.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jirou nodded, \u201cYou seemed really excited. What happened?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>There was no sound as everyone sank back into staring.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kirishima gulped, back pressed hard into the leather seat. He had to think of something to say or they would just keep asking.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI was\u2026 in the hospital,\u201d He said finally, chopsticks clutched hard in his hand.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>No one seemed to move, afraid of what would happen if they did. From the corner of his eye, he could see Sero and Denki glance at each other. Mina fell back, staring at her plate.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Bakugou breathed, leaning forward to look him in the eyes.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kirishima shuddered, looking away. Ochako held his hand, looking much more compassionate than he deserved.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em> What happened to not upsetting anyone? You\u2019re such a fucking failure.\u00a0 </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Ochako gripped his fingers tight as Midoriya also leaned forward to look at him, \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d Kirishima deflected, trying his best to act normal.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNot fine enough to be a fucking intern,\u201d Bakugou growled, and Kirishima sunk back into Ochako, who slapped him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>She grimaced, \u201cNot the right thing to say, Bakugou.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bakugou shut his mouth, fuming as he crossed his arms, \u201cFuck you, Pink Cheeks.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cKnock it off,\u201d Midoriya said firmly, turning his attention to Kirishima, \u201cAre you alright?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAs I said, I\u2019m fine,\u201d Kirishima said, trying his hardest to go back to eating.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Momo shuffled in her seat, \u201cIt must\u2019ve been bad for you to not be able to participate in hero work, Kirishima.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Most of the table hummed in agreement, and Kirishima closed his eyes, trying to ignore the world. His brain was pulsing under his skull as rested his face in his hands.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Iida put a finger to his lips to silence the table, \u201cKirishima seems overwhelmed at the moment, perhaps it\u2019s best if we leave the subject alone.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah guys,\u201d Jirou said, biting one of her nails, \u201cbesides, it\u2019s not like you almost died or anything, right?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The muffled whispers continued for a second before everyone realized Kirishima was not agreeing.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>His throat completely clogged, he coughed. Ochako\u2019s hand squeezed tighter as Bakugou grabbed his shoulder. Not looking at him on purpose, Kirishima stared at his free hand as it tore through the leather.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOi, Kirishima,\u201d Bakugou said, looking absolutely terrified, \u201cright?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kirishima shook his head, tearing his hand away from Ochako, afraid he might hurt her. Bakugou fingers curled into his skin, but Kirishima took some comfort in the pain.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Denki put his elbows on the table, hand in his hair as he stared at the wall. Sero clamped his jaw shut hard.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bakugou ripped him backward, forcing them to look at each other, \u201cYou idiot! Why wouldn\u2019t you tell me?\u201d He yelled.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cBakugou!\u201d Ochako said, yanking Kirishima to her, \u201cStop!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kirishima stared into a sea of red as tears welled in his eyes. They darted to Bakugou phone on the counter, orange case bright and obvious.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI did,\u201d Kirishima whispered, trembling, \u201cI tried, but you wouldn\u2019t return any of my texts or calls.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He looked over to his past friends, all looking a bit pale, \u201cI tried to reach all of you. No one would answer.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The world stilled, maybe from the silence or the lack of movement. It didn\u2019t matter, because it was so sickening that the cause was irrelevant. Nausea from this morning had returned full force as Kirishima flung himself under the table, crawling to the other side.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It was embarrassing, childish even. He didn\u2019t care though, as long as he could escape. Sprinting to the exit, he could hear the commotion behind him. There were blasts, yelling - seemingly from Ochako and Bakugou - and breaking of dishes.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Throwing himself through the doors, he ran for the dorms.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">***</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re a fucking bastard!\u201d Ochako screamed, wrestling Bakugou off the booth and onto the ground, \u201cYou left him alone!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bakugou tried to block the incoming punches, but it was half-hearted at best. He let the blows fall, hoping they\u2019d be a solid excuse for tears. She continued to wail on him until scarred hands reached under her waist and pulled her up.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Deku held onto her struggling frame as she kicked and pushed against him, \u201cNo! I\u2019m gonna kick his ass! Let me go!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou can kick his ass later, people are staring,\u201d Deku warned, turning her around, \u201cbesides, at least he was trying to fix things.\u201d He stared hard at the three ex-friends, grip tightening slightly.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Ochako burned with an anger that could be seen in her eyes, \u201cDon\u2019t think I\u2019ve forgotten you, slimy pink\u00a0<em> cunt </em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Most of the table gasped, Bakugou snickering from where he lay on the floor. He wiped at his bleeding nose.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He had taught her well.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The commotion caused a frenzy in the lunchroom as Ochako successfully kicked Deku\u2019s kneecap hard enough for him to let go.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t call me that! You weren\u2019t there!\u201d Mina screamed, standing up. Sero and Denki both moved away from her.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Ochako laughed grimly as she slammed her fist on the table, \u201cI\u2019m sure the story is very informational. Too bad I don\u2019t give a fuck about it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhen did you become such a bitch?\u201d Mina asked, bending forward. Everyone leaned back from the two girls with caution.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Ochako attempted to get on the table before she was yanked down, this time by Bakugou.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhen did\u00a0<em> I\u00a0 </em>become such a bitch? Look in a mirror! You haven\u2019t been the same since last year. What is wrong with you?\u201d Ochako asked, fighting against Bakugou much less than before.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know shit!\u2019 Mina said, hand leaking with acid. Sero jumped up, yanking her arm down. He winced in pain as the harsh chemicals fell onto his skin, burning him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Sero elbowed her backward, trying to use a napkin to get the acid off, \u201cMina! Knock it off!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSo now you\u2019re defending her?\u201d Mina asked, shoving him back. His shirt was eaten by the corrosive goo.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYes! We fucked up!\u201d He cried, leaning forward so the burns wouldn\u2019t move to his skin.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Denki stood, pushing the whole table into the other side, Iida stopping it with his hands, \u201cPlease, Mina. Look at what we did to him! Why are you so insistent on winning?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHe broke my heart!\u201d She yelled, her face flushed, \u201cdoes that not count for something?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cGood. A miserable bitch like you deserves it,\u201d Bakugou growled, Ochako nodding her head.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Deku pushed between them both, \u201cCan you cut it out? None of this fighting is gonna do anything other than upset Kirishima, which should be the last thing we\u2019re trying to do.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>That seemed to cause the table to calm down, Bakugou\u2019s hold on Ochako becoming more of a hug as they both sunk into guilt.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Mina was still seething, choosing to show it by stalking off. Sero and Denki stayed put, however, feet stuck to the floor by guilt.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNow, I\u2019m going to go talk to him,\u201d Deku said, trying to wipe away the emotional exhaustion from his face, \u201cand the rest of you are gonna go to class as if nothing happened. If Aizawa asks you where I am, you tell him honestly.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He stalked off, the table watching as he left.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">***</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Midoriya knocked calmly on the door, a far too familiar feeling settling into his lungs. He heard some shuffling from behind the wood.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Slowly, the knob turned, and the pair were face-to-face.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The raven-haired boy looked incredibly drained, the bags under his eyes were deep, like a violet cavern.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Neither of them said anything, Midoriya greeting him with a small smile.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>When it became obvious Kirishima wouldn\u2019t speak without prompting, Midoriya took matters into his own hands.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cKirishima,\u201d Midoriya said, twiddling his thumbs nervously, \u201cI might be overstepping but\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He looked down at his red shoes, a color Kirishima was starting to hate.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201c... you tried to kill yourself, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kirishima\u2019s hand clamped down on the doorframe, wood shattering under the pressure. Midoriya didn\u2019t even flinch, stepping forward instead. He placed a gentle hand onto Kirishima\u2019s shoulder, eyes filled with a revolting recognition.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHow did you\u2026\u201d Kirishima whispered.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Midoriya smiled at him sadly, his loose hand falling to his other shoulder.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Red eyes widened; this look wasn\u2019t pity, it was <em>understanding</em>.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhen I was in middle school, Ka\u2026\u201d Midoriya sucked in a breath, \u201ca bully told me to kill myself. My quirk didn\u2019t show until the summer I applied to UA. I was made fun of a lot for being quirkless and I\u2026\u201d He cleared his throat, \u201cI thought maybe he had a point. Maybe I should.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em> Ka </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Whose name starts with a Ka...</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em> chan. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cBakugou..?\u201d Kirishima asked, fear coursing through his blood. He knew they hadn\u2019t gotten along but\u2026</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><em> That\u2019s why he didn\u2019t answer. He </em> <strong> <em>wanted </em> </strong> <em>you to do it. </em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s changed,\u201d Midoriya assured, shaking him some, \u201cHe apologized over the summer for a lot of things. I don\u2019t think those two are even the same person.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>They were the same person to him though. Kirishima had never known Bakugou in middle school; they both didn\u2019t like to talk about those years.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em> He would\u2019ve eaten you alive. You were equal once\u2026 Now look at you. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Midoriya wrapped him in a hug. Kirishima realized then that he was a lot taller than he used to be, stronger too. Kirishima tried his best to return it, the exhaustion eating at him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Midoriya persisted, \u201cI know that look you have. Last week you dropped off all those collectibles in front of my door,\u201d Kirishima could hear the sniffle from below him, \u201cit was like you were trying to tell me you weren\u2019t going to need them anymore.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kirishima felt the tears slide down his cheeks, eyes still unblinking. He was angry at Midoriya; angry he knew about the plans Kirishima had <em>wanted </em>him to notice. The hypocrisy of his actions hadn't escaped him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cPlease, Kirishima,\u201d Midoriya urged, \u201cdon\u2019t. I know it probably doesn\u2019t mean anything right now, but our class would be devastated.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>That, Kirishima knew wasn\u2019t true. It had been clear since the second he\u2019d spent his nights in the hospital alone.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He didn\u2019t want to upset Midoriya, so he returned the hug, nodding.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cKatsuki would be devastated.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kirishima flinched at the name, the first name. Something deep in him wanted to disagree; it wanted to tell Midoriya to stop lying.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He choked back the protest, pressing tighter instead.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">***</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>There was a dark stairwell right off the side of the dorms. Bakugou didn\u2019t take the stairs often anymore; the superiority that came with saying he did had disappeared long ago.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He had used them today.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He wanted to know if Kirishima was okay.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Sitting against the wall, he closed his wet eyes as he listened to the voices. The guilt of knowing he was almost the reason his best friends were dead crawled under his skin like a parasite.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It was suffocating, like <strong><em>sludge</em></strong>; thick like the alleyway in middle school, and he swore he could hear the burning of paper and the snapping of bones. There was the whooshing of air and screams.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>A different time. A different place.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kirishima didn\u2019t need him right now.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">***</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<strong> <em> Reason #57 to Die: I miss my mom. </em> </strong>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<strong> <em> She doesn\u2019t miss me.\u00a0 </em> </strong>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<strong> <em> I\u2019ve been waiting for a phone call for weeks and there\u2019s been nothing.\u00a0 </em> </strong>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<strong> <em> I am nothing. </em> </strong>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<strong> <em> Hey, Bakugou. </em> </strong>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<strong> <em> It\u2019s\u2026 been a while since we spoke.

His discussion with Midoriya had been eating at him for the past couple of days. He had known Bakugou was a bully but he didn\u2019t know it had been that bad. He thought maybe it had been teasing and insults - which was bad, but it wasn't <em>this. </em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>On top of that, he\u2019d been ignoring Bakugou. It was like they had flipped roles, Kirishima tuning out the constant buzzing of his phone.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It felt shitty, he had no idea how Bakugou did it for so long. He wanted to flip his phone over and look at the screen so <em>badly, </em>even if it was just to see if Bakugou was okay.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em> To be fair, he always has been stronger than you. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kirishima nodded to himself, a confirmation that he was just as weak as everyone thought.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat are you thinking about,\u201d Ito asked, crossing his arms. His face was still kind, but he looked concerned.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kirishima could feel the bags under his eyes, that neverending presence of tiredness that coated every piece of him all the way to his core. It was so draining, giving everything he had just to stay alive.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Ito coughed, trying to regain Kirishima\u2019s attention, \u201cSomething to do with school?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Leaning back, Kirishima resting his head on the back of the couch, \u201cMe and Bakugou\u2026 we,\u201d Closing his eyes, he sighed, \u201cWe reconnected when I came back, y\u2019know?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d Ito agreed, \u201cI know. You told me last time you were here. Did something happen?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kirishima opened his eyes again, \u201cYeah.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Ito tapped his pen against his notebook, \u201cDo you want to tell me about it?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He didn\u2019t, not one bit, but he didn\u2019t know how much longer he could keep this inside. \u201cHe\u2026 There\u2019s this kid in my class, Midoriya. He\u2019s a friend of mine too. They didn\u2019t get alone in middle school, at all actually.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>His shoulders sunk, teeth clenched tight, \u201cI knew their relationship was bad, but I guess I didn't understand how bad it was. Bakugou, he\u2026 told Midoriya to kill himself.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI could see how that would affect you very deeply,\u201d Ito said, knuckles on his lips.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah well,\u201d Kirishima said, burning with anger, \u201cMidoriya keeps insisting that he changed. He says he\u2019s not the same person he was in middle school.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, has he changed?\u201d Ito asked, leaning back into his chair.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kirishima fiddled with his fingers, eyes cast downward, trying to dodge Ito\u2019s gaze. Bakugou was different, he could admit that. His explosiveness was still there, sure, but he was kinder - at least outwardly. He didn\u2019t blow up as much, and he stayed calm under insults.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>And\u2026 he and Izuku were best friends. Not just implied friends followed by the excuses of knowing each other forever. Real, genuine best friends.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>That was because they had changed, had grown.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Looking up into the round mirror on Ito\u2019s left, he caught sight of himself, his <em>sad, weak </em>self.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>If anyone hadn\u2019t grown, it was him. He was identical to the kid from middle school, with black hair and dark eyes. The same terrified expression covered his face, showing how much of a coward he really was.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He hated this kid, so why wouldn\u2019t Bakugou.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s changed,\u201d Kirishima rasped, cheeks becoming wet as he began to cry, \u201cbut I haven\u2019t.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Ito squinted at him, looking like he was trying to solve a very intricate puzzle, \u201cYou don\u2019t think you\u2019ve changed?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI know I haven\u2019t,\u201d Kirishima admitted, skin itching with the need to hurt himself. \u201cLook at me. How am I any different than I was before.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Ito sucked in a very telling breath, hands connecting at the fingertips, \u201cAnd\u2026 tell me, what did middle school you do that was so bad?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kirishima was fuming, sick of these god-awful questions, \u201cHe was a coward!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHe was a kid.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kirishima didn\u2019t say anything, couldn\u2019t say anything. It was like a chuck of him had cracked off and shattered into a million tiny pieces. There was only half of his body left.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHe was a scared kid who didn\u2019t know any better,\u201d Ito insisted, crowding his space, \u201cYou <em>are </em>a kid.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m supposed to be stronger than that!\u201d Kirishima yelled, slamming his fist on the table, cracking the wood. \u201cI\u2019m gonna be a hero for fucks sake! How am I supposed to do that when I can\u2019t save myself?!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Ito set a hand on his shoulder, \u201cYou can. Kirishima, you can.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kirishima slapped Ito\u2019s hand away, sight blurry through the tears, \u201cWhat if\u2026. What if I don\u2019t want to?\u201d He shot up, hands out protectively, \u201cWhat if I don\u2019t want to save myself?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He tried to steady himself against the side of the couch, head-spinning, \u201cI\u2019m not worth saving.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Ito stood as well, calm under Kirishima\u2019s storm, \u201cThat\u2019s not true. I wouldn\u2019t be here if it wasn\u2019t.\u201d Sighing, he closed his eyes, \u201cKirishima, don\u2019t you get it? Bakugou, Midoriya, Ochako, all these people you\u2019re telling me about, <em>they</em>\u00a0think you\u2019re worth saving.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThey\u2019re wrong,\u201d Kirishima rasped.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSo, you don\u2019t trust them?\u201d Ito asked.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, I-.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy are you the exception?\u201d He said, grabbing Kirishima\u2019s shoulders. \u201cWhat makes you the one thing they\u2019re wrong about.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kirishima shook his head, \u201cThey don\u2019t know me. Not really. Nobody does.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Ito caught Kirishima\u2019s stare, \u201cThen let them in. Let them see who you really are.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd if they leave?\u201d Kirishima said, voice wavering.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThey won\u2019t,\u201d he assured, \"Eijirou, they won't.\"</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kirishima fell into him, sobbing. Ito caught him, holding the boy up as he cried.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">***</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bakugou sat on his dorm room floor, head in his hands. They were bloody and bruised, skin cracked from the tantrum he had just thrown. They shook violently, fingers shredded.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Surveying his room, he took in the mess he had made. His bed frame was broken and the mattress had dozens of burn marks, sheets singed, and smoking. His mirror was shattered, there were holes in the plaster, and wallpaper was shredded.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He hadn\u2019t lost his temper like this in so long, but Kirishima\u2019s silence was killing him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It was stupid, being upset about something he had done first. He\u2019d done the same thing to Kirishima for three months. If this is what Kirishima\u2019s <em>entire </em>summer felt like, who was he to be sad about it?\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<strong> You deserve what\u2019s happening to you. </strong>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bakugou rested his head against the wall, drained of all energy. He was so tired of fucking everything up.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<strong> Why would anyone want to be friends with you? You break everything you touch. Your hands are made to kill. </strong>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He had been thinking a lot of fucked up things lately. Now that Kirishima knew the truth, he had left him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>And Katsuki deserved it.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>One day, he knew he would face the consequences of his middle school self\u2019s actions. He had hoped, however, his relationship with Kirishima wouldn\u2019t be affected. How dumb of him; Kirishima had told him - confided in him - his insecurities over his quirk. Of course his friend would be hurt by the kid he used to be.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>And, to be honest, he wasn\u2019t sure he would\u2019ve liked Kirishima in middle school either.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kirishima seemed to be kind and collected, the type to stick up for the kids Bakugou constantly bullied. The old Bakugou would\u2019ve called him a coward or a weakling.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bakugou hated him for it. He hated that stupid little boy that thought he was the only person alive.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>This kid he had spent years trying to push down deep inside himself had come back to destroy everything. He was furious he couldn\u2019t change it. All the hurt he had caused would eternally be there. He would always be just another childhood bully.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cKacchan,\u201d Deku said, beating on the door. \u201cShoji called me saying he heard explosions. Are you okay?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bakugou banging his fist on the wall, \u201cFuck off, Deku.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The door opened with a creak, Deku stepping through the entrance. He stopped when he saw the state of the room, backtracking slightly. Looking around in confusion, his eyes landed on Bakugou.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cKacchan? What happened?\u201d Deku asked, genuine concern in his voice.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bakugou turned away, grimacing, \u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYour room is destroyed. How is that fine?\u201d Deku said, walking over to him. He bent down, taking a seat next to his friend. \u201cKacchan, you can tell me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bakugou sniffled, wiping his nose with his bloody fingers, \u201cCan you get the fuck out?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Deku sighed, \u201cJust tell me what\u2019s going on, please?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He slumped over a bit, holding onto his broken hands, \u201cI heard your conversation the other day. I heard all of it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOh,\" Deku said, patting his shoulder, \u201cI-,\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI was in the stairwell. I had come up to check on him, but I didn\u2019t want to interrupt so I just waited,\u201d Bakugou said, resting his head against his knees. \u201cI heard what you said about\u2026 middle school, and about what I said to you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Deku made a noise of discontent, \u201cLook, I didn\u2019t mean to make you feel bad.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou should\u2019ve,\u201d Bakugou said, looking at him. \u201cI\u2019m an awful person, aren\u2019t I?\u201d His eyes were wet, face tilting slightly upwards as not to let the tears fall. \u201cYou both almost died, almost <em>killed yourselves </em>because of me. I\u2019m a monster, a fucking monster, and now.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He collapsed into himself, finally breaking under the pressure, \u201cNow he won\u2019t talk to me anymore. It\u2019s dumb for me to be upset because I did that to him for <em>three fucking months </em>and I can\u2019t even handle two days.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Deku hummed, thinking hard, \u201cWell, it is kind of payback for this summer, but I'm sure he didn\u2019t mean to make you feel that way.\u201d He breathed, studying in the ruined room, \u201cYou sucked in middle school, a lot. You were a raging bitch, really. I hated the way you treated me, even if I didn\u2019t hate you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bakugou\u2019s shoulders shook, cries kept completely silent.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cBut,\u201d Deku said, grabbing his wrist, \u201cyou\u2019ve changed, really and truly grown. I didn\u2019t mean to make you feel like you haven\u2019t.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He tugged on his arm so that Bakugou would look at him, \u201cI\u2019m proud of you. I\u2019m proud of <em>us. </em>\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bakugou turned away, \u201cI ruined everything Izuku, everything. He hates me, I can tell. I just started to fix things and now the old me went a fucking destroyed all my progress.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s a setback, one you can move on from,\u201d Deku reassured. \u201cI know you, and I know him. He\u2019s probably hurting, but if anyone\u2019s seen your progress it\u2019s him.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bakugou didn\u2019t feel like that was true, not one bit. He didn\u2019t know if he would ever feel like he deserved the forgiveness, but this wasn\u2019t about him. It was about Deku and Kirishima.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>And if one of them had chosen to forgive him, perhaps he could get the other one to as well. It would take a lot of convincing, and maybe some begging, but he could do it.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Probably.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">***</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kirishima raised his fist to the door, trying to convince himself to knock. He was shaking like a cold dog, terror licking at his heels. Ito had convinced him that, even if it was scary, they needed to talk.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He didn\u2019t really know what to say, the playbook he had in his head wasn\u2019t likely to play out, but he had to know. He had to know if Bakugou hated him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He tapped the door gently, the noise barely audible. Mentally kicking himself, he sighed. Why did he have to be such a coward all the time?</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>There was shuffling from behind the wood, the sounds of footsteps and things being kicked around. The door opened slightly, a red eye peeking out from the side. As soon as it caught sight of him, it widened.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Swinging the door open, Bakugou stared at him, lips tugged barely upward, \u201cKirishima?\u201d He asked breathlessly.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Taken aback, he scratched at his arms nervously. The words seemed stuck in his throat somewhere, the itchiness crawling from his lungs and to his lips. He couldn\u2019t even make eye contact with the blonde.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d they both said in unison, eyes snapping upwards. Bakugou went to say something but chose not to, mouth still half hung open. Kirishima, wanting a distraction from the discomfort of his own skin, grabbed his wrist.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He took in a deep breath, \u201cI am\u2026 numb all the time and I-.\u201d He used both of his hands to hold Bakugou\u2019s, \u201cI tried to kill myself this summer because I thought it would be so much better than being here. No one seemed to want me around, and if no one liked me and <em>I </em>didn\u2019t like me, why should I stay?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Gently, he pushed himself into Bakugou\u2019s space, walking them back in the room. He shut the door with his foot, \u201cThat feeling hasn\u2019t gone away. I'm sad and angry, sometimes I blow up without meaning to. I\u2019m working on it. I\u2019m trying to get better but\u2026 I need you to tell me that you don\u2019t hate me.\u201d Kirishima squeezed his hand, \u201cTell me that this me is okay too.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bakugou didn\u2019t say anything for a moment, thoughts fuzzy as he tried to shake them back to clear like a sad etch-a-sketch. \u201cKirishima, I didn\u2019t mean to make you feel like you weren\u2019t good enough. I thought-,\u201d he stopped, cringing at his own words, \u201cNo, whether I meant it or not it still hurt you and you didn\u2019t deserve that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He returned the grasp, Kirishima\u2019s lip trembling under the implications of such a small action, \u201cI spent so much time worried about fixing things with Deku that I left you behind. That\u2026 wasn\u2019t fair.\u201d He rolled his eyes away, trying to fight off that lump in his throat.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bakugou laughed sadly, \u201cYou remember everyone in class\u2019s birthday, you keep mementos from people you\u2019ve hardly met because they\u2019re that important to you, and you have a list of everyone\u2019s favorite snacks for when it\u2019s your turn to get groceries for the class.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He smiled softly, barely noticeable, \u201cI know you hate the color pink but still wear it sometimes because Ochako always gets excited, and you geek out with Deku even though you don\u2019t like All Might that much. For fuck\u2019s sake Kiri, you put up with <em>me</em>, even from the beginning.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Kirishima,\u201d he returned his gaze to sad eyes, \u201cthat I made you feel like <em>any </em>you isn\u2019t good enough.\u201d Gritting his teeth under the embarrassment, he sighed, \u201cI like all of you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Expecting some sort of response, probably an angry one, Bakugou stared at him. Kirishima laughed, tears finally escaping the confines of his eyes, \u201cGod, you looked like complimenting me was going to kill you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI tried my best dammit!\u201d He yelled, his face dusted with light crimson as little pops exploded from between their hands. Bakugou let out several curses, all covered by Kirishima\u2019s laughter.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Hands still intertwined, Kirishima moved forward, resting his head on Bakugou's shoulder. Letting out a grunt of surprise, Bakugou\u2019s tirade ceased.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you mean it, what you said?\u201d Kirishima rasped, removing his hands from Bakugou\u2019s to wrap them under his arms, hands landing on his shoulder blades.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bakugou slowly moved his hands as well, sliding them over Kirishima\u2019s waist and onto his back, \u201cI don\u2019t say shit I don\u2019t fucking mean.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWell,\u201d Kirishima whispered, pressing his face into the crook of Bakugou\u2019s neck, \u201cI like all of you too.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>They stayed like that for a moment, basking in the feeling of each other's embrace. Then, Kirishima pulled away.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"What happened to your room?\" Kirishima said, looking confused.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bakugou grimaced, \"I, uh, got angry and tore it apart.\"</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"Oh,\" Kirishima said. He smiled, far too bright for the dark and gloomy room, \"Let me help you pick up.\"</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bakugou shook his head, \"Absolutely not. I made the mess, I'll clean it up.\"</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"C'mon, it'll be like the first day we were in the dorms! Remember when I helped you unpack?\" Kirishima asked.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"Of course I do,\" Bakugou said, rolling his eyes.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"You were a real bitch back then,\" Kirishima said, grinning.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bakugou huffed, \"Yeah, I was, huh?\" Taking in the sight of Kirishima, who was bouncing nervously on his feet, he broke, \"Fine, you can help.\"</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kirishima agreed excitedly, following after Bakugou as he made his way to the worst of the mess.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">***</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you really think they\u2019ll figure it out?\u201d Ochako muttered, peeking out from the stairwell.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Deku nodded, \u201cI have faith in both of them.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWell duh,\u201d Ochako said sardonically, punching his shoulder lightly, \u201cbut this is, like, a big deal. I just want them both to be happy again. They look so sad all the time.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he agreed, looking at her quizzically, \u201cHow did your talk with Mina go?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>She rolled her eyes, \u201cBad. Denki and Sero were on my side at least. I just don\u2019t think Mina wants to admit she\u2019s wrong. To be fair, after fucking up this big, I probably wouldn\u2019t either.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cShe\u2019s dug her hole deep enough, she can pull herself out on her own,\u201d Deku muttered, eyes glued on the door.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>There was the sound of small pops, some louder than others, and then Kirishima\u2019s booming laughter. Smiling, the pair exchanged glances, sharing a small fist bump.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI think they\u2019ll be fine without us,\u201d Deku said, Ochako nodding.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cLet\u2019s go get mochi.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">***</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<strong> <em> I don\u2019t think I\u2019m coming back to UA.

He felt sluggish and exhausted, unable to properly move. Too tired to even keep his eyes open, he yawned.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He had spent the night helping Bakugou clean his room, both of them inevitably falling into bed without much of a thought, passing out in the early hours of the morning. Thankfully, his bedroom was as back to normal as it could be. Some things still needed replacing. He assumed that\u2019s what Bakugou was doing on his phone during English. Not that Kirishima had been looking, absolutely not.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>If he was, no one could prove it.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kirishima had managed to pull together enough energy to make it through his classes that day, even finishing most of his homework during his last period. Training had been canceled since the exercise grounds were under repair, so he had escaped the sore muscles that were sure to come had they proceeded.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He reached the bottom of the stairs, only to be yanked off to the side. Stumbling, he fell into the body that had pulled him away. Screwing his head back together, Kirishima looked up to the person.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>His vision was filled with pink.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Panicking, he drew away. Mina looked bored, maybe a little pissed; whatever emotion it was, it wasn\u2019t pleasant.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cKirishima,\u201d she said, leaning into the wall.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He scratched his name nervously, eyes shifting, \u201cHey, Mina.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t \u2018Hey, Mina\u2019 me, jackass,\u201d Mina bit, bending forward menacingly.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He snapped his mouth shut, shoulders bunching up in apprehension, \u201cRight. Sorry.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Rolling her eyes, she sighed, \u201cIs that all you ever do anymore, nod your head and agree?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kirishima opened his mouth to say something, but Mina lifted her hand, \u201cForget it. I already know the answer.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>There was a tense silence between the two, air thick with animosity. Kirishima wanted to say something, but couldn\u2019t think of the words that seemed right.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Scuffing her shoes against the floor, Mina kicked his leg, \u201cI\u2019m here to apologize. Well, that\u2019s what I told Ochako anyways.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat are you here to do then?\u201d Kirishima asked, shifting on his feet.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Mina propelled herself off the wall, putting a hand on each of his arms, \u201cYou\u2019re a dick.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Taken aback, Kirishima felt his body begin to fill with rage, \u201cI\u2019m a dick?\u00a0<em> I\u2019m </em>a dick?! Are you insane?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou act like you\u2019re entirely innocent! You know you\u2019re not,\u201d Mina whispered, voice somehow still powerful. \u201cDon\u2019t act like you were a fucking angel of a friend,\u201d she said, holding her phone up to his face.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kirishima tried to look down to the screen, eyes failing to see the text and Mina ripped it away. \u201cDo you know what this says?\u201d Mina asked, getting his space.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Failing to think of a reason Mina would be so upset, Kirishima shook his head. Scoffing, Mina began to read from the screen, \u201cHey Mina, I hope this text finds you well since it\u2019s obvious none of the other ones fucking did.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Eyes widening, Kirishima reached for the phone, \u201cWait. Hold on.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cMaybe if you weren\u2019t such a bitch this wouldn\u2019t have happened, but for some reason you\u2019re too stubborn to believe that anyone else on Earth is as important to you,\u201d Mina bit, becoming increasingly angry.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><em> He hadn\u2019t sent that. Sure, he had typed it out when he\u2026. was in the bathtub but he hadn\u2019t </em> <strong> <em>sent </em> </strong> <em>it.

I don\u2019t know what you told them, but no one will answer my texts or calls. I hate you. I hate you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI was so angry at the time and I was trying to get it all out. I didn\u2019t mean to hurt you. Please, I\u2019m so sorry,\u201d he pleaded.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNow you\u2019re sorry? You sent this, pressed the fucking button, and everything. You had months to apologize and you choose to now?\u201d Mina laughed bitterly, \u201cYou are a fucking coward.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kirishima grabbed her hands as softly as he could under the panic, \u201cI know. I know, okay?\u201d He took in body rocking breathes, eyes glassy, \u201cI didn\u2019t mean it. I didn\u2019t mean for you to see it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cBut I did!\u201d Mina yelled, shoving him to the ground, his head thumping against the wall. She let out a furious noise, face twisted in hatred, \u201cI saw it, and now I know you <em>actually </em>tried to do it. You seriously tried to kill yourself!\"</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kirishima rasped, terror resting in his bones, \u201cHow do you know?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cCome on!\u201d Mina screamed, bending down over him, \u201cI find out you went to the hospital right after you send me this and I\u2019m supposed to think it was anything else?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThis is what you wanted me to know before you did it?\u201d Tearing up, she bent over him as he rubbed his sore skull, \u201cHow was I supposed to fix our friendship when this is the last thing you wanted me to hear? You acted like I was a\u00a0<strong> <em> monster</em></strong>. You tried to kill yourself because you were lonely just to make me feel bad about it?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Kirishima whimpered, hands trembling as he tried to protect himself. \u201cI was so angry that you left me alone, I typed out every horrible thing I could think of. I wanted to hurt you the way you hurt me.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The room fell into an odd calmness, both with tears in their eyes they refused to admit to sharing, \u201cWhen I read it again, it sounded so stupid, and I knew it was wrong. I thought,\u201d Kirishima lifted his head, \u201cI thought I deleted it. I was\u2026 tired.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Hand dropping down to her waist, Mina stared at him, \u201cWhy were you tired?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kirishima didn\u2019t answer, looking away. She grabbed his face, yanking his head towards her\u2019s, cheeks covered in tears, \u201cWhy the fuck were you tired? Answer me!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI was bleeding!\u201d Kirishima answered, sobbing. He shoved her hand away, pushing her backward so she fell to his height.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Mina crawled back some, \u201cYou were bleeding?\u201d She stared up to the ceiling, a sick look of recognition on her face, \u201cYou were bleeding.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Neither of them said anything, Kirishima huddled into himself against the wall. Mina\u2019s eyes were still on the tile above them.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou were dying, weren\u2019t you?\u201d she whispered, wiping at the tears. \u201cYou sent that to me while you were dying.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean it,\u201d he whimpered, teeth grit together. \u201cI was so weak, and everything was so\u2026 dark. I must have hit send on accident. I didn\u2019t mean it. \u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>There was no refuge anywhere; he couldn\u2019t hide from his colossal fuck-up anymore. It was right there beneath the blue light.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Mina stood up, no offering of help to give to him. She looked tired, burdened.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>She looked like him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou did,\u201d she said, staring at the wall above him. \u201cMaybe you don\u2019t anymore, but you did then.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Shifting away, she smacked her hand against her thigh as if trying to calm herself, \u201cCan you imagine what it\u2019s like to hear the person you\u2026 love tell you that you\u2019re the reason they\u2019re going to kill themselves.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>She paused, before looking back at him, \u201cWhat if Bakugou had sent you that text?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Something hot and sharp burst through him like he\u2019d been shot, mind running through the scenario over and over in just a few seconds. The thought of Bakugou lying in a bathtub filled with red, murky water was enough to make him sick.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em> Head rolled to the side, eyes glossed over as his mother beat on the door. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<strong> <em> Katsuki, please!

I might be a bitch now, but I wasn\u2019t back then,\u201d she said, gesturing backward. \u201cI left because being around you <em>hurt</em>, Kirishima. Sero and Denki abandoned you on their own.\u201d Mina scratched her arm, \u201cWhy was that my fault?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kirishima shut his eyes, \u201cI never said it was. I didn\u2019t want you to apologize, okay? All the horrible stuff you\u2019ve done to me, I deserved. You were right to treat me like that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kirishima was too tired to keep arguing, \u201cI\u2019ve always deserved the bad things that happen to me. I just didn\u2019t know it at the time, so I was mad. I was angry everyone had left,\u201d he sniffled, \u201cbut now I realized you were right to go.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI fuck everything up,\u201d he said, emotionless, \u201cNo one should be ruined with me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Mina stared at him, black eyes looking everywhere and nowhere at once.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she said, turning around to leave, \u201cI\u2019m sorry that I hurt you. Maybe I shouldn\u2019t have gone so far but\u2026\u201d she sighed, \u201cI guess being angry gives you a pass to be a bad person, at least according to you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He attempted to reach out, only for her to move away from his hand, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I won\u2019t tell anyone about your text. I haven\u2019t even told Sero and Denki, so what\u2019s the point of making everything worse?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou stay away from me,\u201d Mina said, walking away. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll stay away from you. No point in ruining each other.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kirishima could do nothing but nod, sinking back into the brick wall.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The voice in the back of his head took over, returning from its shallow grave.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><em> If anyone\u2019s the monster here,\u00a0 </em> <strong> <em> it\u2019s you. </em> </strong></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">***</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bakugou bounced his leg up and down, sat on the couch with Deku and Ochako. They both looked just as concerned as he did. They had all decided they would meet up for a movie, a simple distraction from the day.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sure he\u2019s fine,\u201d Ochako tried to reassure, \u201cjust delayed.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It brought no comfort.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>To be honest, Bakugou was terrified when Kirishima was even a minute late these days. He\u2019d fidget nervously and check the clock and his phone a hundred times, waiting for something. It felt like a sign he shouldn\u2019t ignore, eyes always searching for red hair and sharp teeth.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Because, if he wasn\u2019t where he was supposed to be then maybe\u2026</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Maybe he was in his room.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Alone.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<strong> Dead. </strong>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Trying to shake the thought away, Bakugou rested his head in his hands. His muscles were tense, just like the rest of him, and he could feel the oncoming headache settling into his skull.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He stood up, needing to move, \u201cI\u2019m going to check on him.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The couple exchanged a glance before nodding. Bakugou stalked off, making his way towards the stairs.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>His stomach felt twisted, knotted together by apprehension and worry. Kirishima had promised he would be there, and now he wasn\u2019t. There were plenty of reasons that might be, but only one was swirling through his head.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He took two steps at a time.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He burst through the stairwell door, moving faster than he wanted to, but his body was running on adrenaline.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>As he reached for his friend's door handle the chemicals faded fast, replaced by an icy fear that stopped him in his tracks.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He wanted to open the door so bad, to rip it open to make sure everything was okay.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>But what if it wasn\u2019t?</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The pounding of his heart refused to cease as he knocked softly, \u201cKirishima?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>There was no answer.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cKirishima?\u201d He tried again, turning the handle some.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Nothing.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Panicked, he threw the door open, bursting in.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kirishima stood in front of him, looking pissed. Sighing in relief, Bakugou shook his head, \u201cFuck, Shitty Hair, you scare-.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDid I say you could come in?\u201d Kirishima bit, shoving him back.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Slamming into the wall, Bakugou growled, \u201cWhat the fuck!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI said, did I say you could come in?\u201d Kirishima said again, cracking his knuckles. His eyes burned bright with anger.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNo! But who gives a fuck! You could\u2019ve-.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cBeen dead?\u201d Kirishima replied, rolling his eyes. He laughed bitterly, shaking his fist, \u201cSuddenly you\u2019re all worried about me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bakugou sunk a bit, \u201cThat\u2019s not fair.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI think it\u2019s perfectly fair,\u201d Kirishima said, backing off. \u201cI think this summer proved enough.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re just trying to push me away! I won\u2019t let you,\u201d Bakugou answered, moving away from the plaster. \u201cI know what you\u2019re doing. I tried to do it myself.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kirishima grumbled, face dark, \u201cYou don\u2019t know shit about me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThen let me! Let me know you!\u201d Bakugou pleaded, hands outstretched. \u201cYou did it for me once, now let me do it for you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI slit my wrists in the bathtub,\u201d Kirishima bit, getting into Bakugou\u2019s space.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bakugou\u2019s face contorted into disbelief, \u201cWhat?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI cut my wrist with my mom\u2019s broken razor and now she hasn\u2019t shaved in three months. My dad busted down the door and broke his fingers doing it and now he can\u2019t make his fucking bento box in the morning because his hands shake from the nerve damage,\u201d Kirishima growled, balling up his fist in Bakugou\u2019s shirt.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cMy mom had the tub replaced because she couldn\u2019t get the red ring on it to go away. Don\u2019t you get it?\u201d He slammed Bakugou, still speechless, against the wall. \u201cI am a fucking burden on everyone I touch! Even when I\u2019m trying to do something\u00a0<strong> <em> good </em> </strong>\u00a0I fuck everything up!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy is killing yourself good?\u201d Bakugou asked, voice broken like the chipped tile on Kirishima\u2019s bathroom floor.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Unstoppable fingers rested against immovable skin.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kirishima dropped his face away from his gaze, \u201cBecause if I\u2019m gone, so is the burden.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIsn\u2019t that better for everyone?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bakugou bit the inside of his cheek, fingers curling into the far too soft skin, \u201cNo. Fuck, Eijirou. Please, tell me you don\u2019t believe that. Killing yourself... it's not the answer you think it is.\"</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kirishima shook his head, resting it against the blonde\u2019s sternum, \u201cIt has to be the right answer because I\u2019m just a fucked up patchwork mess of all the shitty things that make me a person. A terrible, depressed, coward of a person.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bakugou rested his lips against the other\u2019s hairline, muttering into his skin so it would soak through, \u201cI like patchwork.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Kirishima asked.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI lived in fashion my whole life. I know what patchwork looks like up close,\u201d He said, pulling Kirishima closer. \u201cSometimes it\u2019s weird and crooked with all those ugly fucking colors and shit, but it\u2019s <em>real. </em>\u00a0Everything is just a stitched-up dumpster fire of parts, that doesn\u2019t make it bad. If you\u2019re patchwork, then I like patchwork. It\u2019s that simple.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kirishima pulled his head up, inches away from Bakugou\u2019s face, \u201cAnd what if I fall apart?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI know how to sew.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kirishima stared at for a moment before trying his hardest to hold back a smile, \u201cYou do?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bakugou groaned, throwing his head against the wall, \u201cI was trying to - fuck I don\u2019t know - have a moment?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kirishima nodded, wiping at the tears as he laughed, \u201cIt was nice. I liked it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"I'm serious though. You're not bad, even if your pieces are a little disconnected,\" Bakugou said. \"I know I can't convince you of that right now, but I will. I promise I will.\"</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kirishima loosened some, relaxing as he listened to Bakugou's words, \"Thanks Bakugou.\"</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bakugou looked at him, taking in all his features. Red eyes with small bags and a toothy smile. There was this swelling in his chest, heart thundering under the storm that was Kirishima Eijirou. Reaching out a shaky hand, he rested it on his cheek, still even as Kirishima flinched.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHey,\u201d Bakugou said, voice dripping with caramel, \u201cKirishima.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Staring, Kirishima simply nodded in response. Bakugou leaned in closer,\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The room stilled, both of them inches away from the other. He rested his other hand on Kirishima\u2019s waist, holding on tenderly. Their noses were almost connected, \u201cI think I-.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>His phone rang.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Startled, they both jumped, Bakugou frantically reaching for his phone. He ripped it out of his pocket, bodies still connected.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d He growled, furiously clutching the phone. The caller ID,\u00a0<em> Number 1 Loser</em>, flickered on the screen.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIs everything ok?\u201d Deku asked politely.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bakugou let out a frustrated noise. Scoffing, he went to tell Deku off, fire burning inside of him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He gasped as there was a soft press of lips to his neck under his jaw. Kirishima's hair tickled his cheek as the boy blew air against his warm skin.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cY-Yeah. We\u2019ll be down in a minute!\u201d Bakugou called, hanging up fast.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The peppering kisses continued up the side of his face, hands on his waist pulling him close. He tried to tuck his head away, but there was no escape. He gritted his teeth to not let any noise out.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kirishima chuckled, lips against his hairline, \u201cWe should probably head down there.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Bakugou asked breathlessly, hands in Kirishima\u2019s hair.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThe others are worried, so we should head downstairs,\u201d He said it like it was the obvious thing in the world.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bakugou glanced around in disbelief, \u201cYou can\u2019t just\u2026 I-.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cCome on,\u201d Kirishima said, grabbing his wrist and pulling him out of the door, \u201cWe\u2019re already late!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bakugou stumbled after him, still in shock from the events minutes before. Shuffling to keep up, he looked down at their intertwined hands and smiled.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">***</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The rift in Kirishima's chest was wider than ever, but he had to ignore it. His plan would work out, he knew that, but maybe he could enjoy the little things before he went.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Like the smell of caramel and high-end shampoo.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Besides, if Bakugou thought there was something wrong, he'd try to stop him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He couldn't let that happen.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">***</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Deku watched the screen, end credits scrolling as Ochako whimpered beside him. He wept freely.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cKirishima, can you hand me the tissue?\u201d He blubbered, reaching towards the other end of the couch. When there was no response, he looked over, \u201cKiri?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kirishima was cuddled up on the couch, fast asleep. Bakugou was curled up in his lap, face against his stomach as his blonde hair fell over his face.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Their hands were tangled together.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Smiling, Deku pulled the blanket off of him, laying gently over the two as he and Ochako left them alone.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>As their footsteps disappeared, Bakugou smiled softer, snuggling in close.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">***</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<strong> <em> Reason #95 to Die: I sent the text.

Kirishima lifted his bangs with his fingers, a bit hot from the humid air. The birds chirped melodies around him, and there was a smile on his face.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>His notebook was tucked under his arm.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He was heading to his favorite childhood park, where a very important testament to his past lay. Passing the gate, he opened the book, flipping through the pages.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It had been a week since his confrontation with Mina, and she had made good on her promise. She had left him alone, no insults or gossip; there was only passive silence.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It hasn\u2019t been as nice as he thought.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Sighing, he tapped a hand against the metal swing set, stepping in a puddle as he did so. Thankfully, the water was minimal, so his sock remained dry.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He had been noticing the little things a lot lately. Just the other day he realized Ochako, Iida, and Deku had matching bracelets. He had made a point to sketch them in the back of his journal.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kirishima knew that the notebook would probably be found after he died. He didn\u2019t want it to be all bad. Maybe someone would read through it someday and realize he had been happy in moments. Perhaps, if they knew him, it would ease some of the pain.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He made it to the bench, sitting down on the cool metal after he brushed away the water. Leaning back, he basked in the morning sun for a brief second.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Blinking, he felt the drip of water on his face as the leaves on the tree above him shook. Some it landed on the pages as well, soaking through the paper into tiny splatters.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Staring at it, he pulled his pen out of his pocket and clicked it.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He set the ballpoint against the page.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em> Hello, my name is Eijirou Kirishima.\u00a0 </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em> I am a 3rd-year student at UA High School in the Hero Course.

Tapping his shoes against the bench, he looked up at the monument, eyes squinting under the sun just behind the figure. Crimson Riot seemed so powerful, arms carrying a dozen civilians to safety; the moment trapped in bronze forever.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He felt so incredibly small here, shadow casted over him from the statue. Kirishima wondered if, had things gone differently, he could\u2019ve been there eventually. Would people have built statues for him?\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He doubted it.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m really sorry sir,\u201d he rasped, standing. He walked over to the edge, placing the notebook right on the concrete ring around the hero. Trying to wipe the tears away, he stepped away, \u201cI\u2019m sorry I wasn\u2019t good enough for your name.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Leaving the notebook, filled with a hundred bad memories and eighty-two good ones, right there in the middle of his favorite park.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He wouldn\u2019t be coming back to get it.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p align=\"center\">***</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Opening the door to his house, Kirishima kicked off his shoes. His mom appeared in the entrance, smiling in her tender way.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHi baby!\u201d She said kindly, walking up to him for a hug. He wrapped his arms around her, a grin wide on his face.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Laughing, she gasped, \u201cWhat are you so excited for?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNothing special,\u201d Kirishima replied honestly, tucking his head into the crook off her neck. Pulling him away, his mom stared him dead in the eyes.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>She had this look on her face, eyes proud and lips tugged upwards. \u201cWhat?\u201d Kirishima asked, pulling on her shirt.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s just\u2026 you look so happy,\u201d she rasped, kissing his forehead gently. Before she removed herself, she pat his face in that motherly way.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kirishima followed her into the kitchen, his dad sitting at the table.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cEijirou!\u201d He said, surprised, \u201cWhy are you here?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWow, dad,\u201d Kirishima said, grabbing a soda from the fridge, \u201cnot even a hello.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>His dad chuckled, standing up. Grabbing his son from behind, he swung him around a couple times. Kirishima laughed softly, trying to shove him off, \u201cThat\u2019s not what I meant!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNow you\u2019re picky!\u201d His dad exclaimed, pushing his head down some.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>His mom, Aoi, slapped her wash cloth against her thigh, \u201cBoys! What did I say about wrestling the house!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Isamu groaned, dragging his son backwards a little, \u201cCome on! Me and Eijirou are just having some fun!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cFun that\u2019s going to bust my new fridge! I\u2019m not paying for it when you smash the ice dispenser,\u201d she said, crossing her arms.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWe got it mom,\u201d Eijirou laughed, smacking his dad\u2019s arm as he let go. Stumbling, he fell into the stove, bending over to look in the pot, \u201cWhat are you making?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou father <em> was </em>making Udon, but it seems he\u2019s forgotten about it. Again,\u201d Aoi said, grinning.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Isamu blew air, \u201cForgot? No! What? I never forget anything!\u201d He quickly stirred the soup.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kirishima looked over to the bathroom as his parents bantered lightly. The door was wide open, giving him the perfect view of the cabinet above the sink.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHey, guys?\u201d Kirishima said, stealing their attention. \u201cI\u2019m going to use my bathroom, okay?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Both of his parents paled, glancing at each other. His mom stuttered out a reply as he turned to go, \u201cHow about you use the downstairs bathroom instead?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Mentally high-fiving himself, Kirishima feigned innocence, \u201cYeah. I got it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He made his way to the bathroom faster than he probably should\u2019ve, shutting the door softly behind him. He flushed the toilet after an appropriate amount of time. Then, he turned on the sink and ripped open the cabinet.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Digging through the various medications, he found his bottle, stuffing it into the backpack he was still wearing. Then, he closed the doors and shut off the sink.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>As he walked out, both of his parents sighed in relief.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He felt bad, tricking them like this. He hated how naive they were, eyes shining with hope.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em> You could stay.\u00a0 </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>This is for the better. I know that now.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em> Look at them. You\u2019re going to hurt them.\u00a0 </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>If hurting them means they\u2019re free, then that\u2019s alright.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAre we having Udon for dinner?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">***</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The next morning, Kirishima slipped on his shoes. He stepped through the door, hand on the frame. However, with one foot outside, he paused. Turning back around, he shot his mom, who looked weary, a small smile.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cBye mom. Bye dad,\u201d he said, brows dipping.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>She perked up some, waving to him softly as his dad responded, \u201cWe\u2019ll see you later kid!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kirishima shut the door without answering.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">***</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you coming to karaoke tonight?\u201d Deku asked, leaning over the kitchen counter.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bakugou swatted him away, focusing on his cooking. He was planning to ask an important question later, excitement bundled in nerves heavy in his lungs.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cCome on Kacchan!\u201d Deku whined, tapping his fingers on the desk, \u201cYou never do anything with us! Come out this one night.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Grunting, Bakugou said, \u201cFine! Fine! I\u2019ll go. Stupid nerd.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou are being awfully mean today Kacchan,\u201d Deku said, straightening up. \u201cAre you planning something?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Sighing, he continued to move the meat around on the pan, \u201cYes! I\u2019m making dinner for\u2026 Kirishima and I\u2019m trying to focus so could you get off my back?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Deku drew out, hands in the air.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Ochako walked into the room, hair up, \u201cHey Izuku!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cO-Oh! Hey Ochako!\u201d Deku sputtered, seeming to forget that she was his girlfriend.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDo I look alright?\u201d She asked, slinging an arm over his shoulder.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He nodded furiously, face red, \u201cYep! Yeah! Of course!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Ochako giggled, looking over to Bakugou, \u201cHey! Have you seen Kirishima? I know he stayed with his parents last night, but I haven\u2019t seen him at all today. Have you heard from him?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Worry settling into his bones, he shook his head.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Then, the doorknob clicked, and Kirishima stepped through the frame. Ochako waved to him, \u201cKirishima! We were just talking about you!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d Kirishima said, looking unusually happy, \u201cAll good things I hope.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bakugou shuffled on his feet, rocking back and forth in fear. He had asked Ochako for advice on how to ask Kirishima out, but now that the moment was in front of him, he felt like running away.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Sniffing the air, Kirishima smiled brightly at him, \u201cAre you making food?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bakugou faltered over his quick response, \u201cWhat does it look like I\u2019m doing?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Ochako and Deku exchanged a glance before she rested her hand on his arm, yanking him up, \u201cWe need to get ready for the karaoke bar!\u201d She explained, pulling Deku towards the door, \u201cWe\u2019ll see you there!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>They both watched the couple, bewildered by the interaction.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kirishima walked over to where Bakugou was standing, who quickly went back to work on the food. Kirishima waited for a moment, Bakugou\u2019s back turned to him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He wrapped his arms around Bakugou\u2019s waist, hugging him from behind. The blonde blew air, the tips of his ears red.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kirishima wished he\u2019d gotten more of these simple moments of peace with Bakugou. He had hoped he\u2019d die without any remorse for the things he hadn\u2019t done.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>This, however, his failed relationship with the boy he loved, he\u2019d regret forever.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bakugou felt his shoulders shake with Kirishima's head, a wet spot forming on his shirt. Concerned, he tried to turn, only for the hands on his waist to tighten more. \u201cOi, Kiri? What the fuck?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNothing,\u201d Kirishima rasped, snuggling in closer as he sniffled. \u201cIt\u2019s not a big deal.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bakugou resigned himself to cooking, periodically looking back at Kirishima, who refused to let go. He didn\u2019t mind. It was nice to have Kirishima near him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAre going to the karaoke bar tonight night?\u201d Bakugou asked, clicking his tongue to punctuate the sentence.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kirishima shook his head, \u201cI really want to catch up on some sleep. You should go though!\u201d He said quickly, \u201cI want you to go.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay..?\u201d Bakugou said suspiciously, a little less focused on dinner. The bubbling oil was the only sound for a moment.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHey, I was thinking tomorrow, after lunch, we should\u2026 get food together,\u201d Bakugou said, nerves rattling. \u201cJust us this time.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kirishima didn\u2019t say anything, doubt crawling up Bakugou\u2019s fingers and biting his nails.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>There was a movement, and then a chaste kiss pressed to his reddened ear.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cCan\u2019t,\u201d Kirishima whispered, \u201cI won\u2019t be around tomorrow.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Confused, Bakugou tried to figure out what such a statement could mean. He lost all train of thought when a hand grabbed his, thumb rubbing against it tenderly.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI want to, really,\u201d Kirishima assured, right next to his ear. \u201cbut I can\u2019t. Maybe,\u201d there was an odd crack in his voice, \u201cmaybe another time.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bakugou nodded, looking down at their intertwined hands. He brought them up to his lips, kissing them softly. \u201cYou promise?\u201d He mumbled.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kirishima didn\u2019t answer, humming against his shoulder instead.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Without a reply, Bakugou started to really worry, \u201cMaybe I should sta-.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNo!\u201d Kirishima said, stopping him. They stared at each a moment.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He sighed, \u201cI know your cutting time out of your day to hang out with me, and only me, but I want you to spend time with your other friends too. It\u2026 makes me feel bad when you ignore them to be with me.\u201d He squeezed his hand tighter, \u201cYou should hang out with them for tonight. I\u2019m going to sleep anyway.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bakugou fiddled with their fingers, gloomier than before, \u201cWell then, can we hang out before I leave, since you won\u2019t be here tomorrow?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kirishima smiled lightly, wiping at his face, \u201cYeah, I\u2019d like that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">***</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Waving at the group as they left, Kirishima stood by the exit. His face fell as soon as they were out of earshot, muscles relaxing. He rubbed his sore jaw.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Walking towards the stairs, Kirishima grabbed his backpack off the kitchen counter. Shaking it to hear the noise of white against orange, he picked up his pace.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He took the steps two at a time.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Opening his bedroom door, he fished the bottle out, staring at the label.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em> They\u2019re going to miss you.\u00a0 </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThey\u2019ll get over it,\u201d Kirishima said out-loud.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em> Aren\u2019t you scared? </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cStopping because I\u2019m scared would make me a coward.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><em> Your parents </em>.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s better this way,\u201d he said, turning the cap.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em> What about your friends? Deku and Ochako? </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s better this way,\u201d he repeated, finally getting it off.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em> Ito? You\u2019re going to fail him! </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI was going to do that anyway.\u201d Speaking of Ito, this nagging little voice sounded an awful lot like his therapist.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em> Bakugou? </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kirishima stopped.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em> What if he\u2019s the one that finds you? How do you think he\u2019s going to feel knowing he couldn\u2019t save his best friend.\u00a0 </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>His hands shook violently, pills smashing together as he did so.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cStop it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><em> He thought you were happy!

Stay here for him! </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He shook his head, \u201cI can\u2019t give up now. I got all the way here.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em> Think about him! </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He did, mind swirling over moments and pieces in time. After awhile, he thought about Bakugou in the future, standing on stage while accepting his award for Number #1 Hero. He was smiling, big, bright, and very much un-Bakugou. There\u2019s this wicked look of pride on his face when he\u2019s pulled away from stage by a reporter.</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b> <em>\u201cCongratulations Dynamight!

Gagging, he stumbled over to his bed. Before crawling in though, he changed his mind, the coldness of the floor seeming particularly inviting.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Laying on the wood, he finally noticed the stinging in his leg. Looking down, he saw the giant claws marks that scaled his thigh.

He tried to blink the white from his eyes, still sat uncomfortably in the booth with his classmates. Sero and Denki flipped through the pages of the songbook with Tokoyami, trying to find him a dark enough tune. Ochako and Tsuyu were tearing through snacks, and Deku was singing\u00a0<em> very badly </em>\u00a0on the stage, Jirou, Shoji, and Iida cheering him all.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bakugou hadn\u2019t moved since he got to the bar, thinking hard over the last interaction he had with Kirishima. He had seemed happy, but was it weird to say he was too happy?

Fiddling with his straw, he burned holes into the tiles.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kirishima had been talking funny too, making all these cryptic statements and refusing to return promises. It made Bakugou feel seasick, like the floor was shifting around him, moving side-to-side.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>His phone buzzed on the other side of the table and he reached for it, only for it to be pulled away. Ochako held it up, shaking her head, \u201cNo phone. Kirishima\u2019s orders.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Sighing, Bakugou sunk back into the leather, scowling harshly. Mina grabbed the phone from Ochako\u2019s hand, earning her a nasty glance. \u201cSpeaking of Kirishima,\u201d she sighed, holding the phone up, \u201che\u2019s the one that called.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Worrying his lip, Bakugou ripped it from her grasp, looking at it.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em> 1 Missed Call: Kirishima </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Staring at the screen again, Bakugou watched as another notification popped up.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em> 1 Voicemail: Kirishima </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bakugou pushed out of the booth, waving off the group protests.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI have to piss,\u201d he snarled, the words a thin excuse. No one said anything.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He stalked off towards the door, pushing through it and into the cold bathroom. Shutting and locking himself in the stall, Bakugou sat on the toilet. He opened the phone app and went to voicemails.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>His box was almost full, stuffed to the brim with missed calls from his mom and dad, along with a couple from Best Jeanist. However, the newest and oldest voicemails were from the same person.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The first voicemail had never pierced his ears, refusing to put himself through the pain of the past so he could move forward. Now, it seemed to be calling his name. It had been sitting there since the third week of summer, a time that Bakugou now realized lined up with Kirishima\u2019s first attempt. He was struck with cold terror.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He put the phone up to his ear, the play button pressed. His knees were locked together, shaking under the tension.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em> Hey, Bakugou. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em> It\u2019s\u2026 been a while since we spoke.

She was incredibly bored, feeling a disconnect from the place around her.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tired of the ambiance, she got up, making her way to the exit without anyone\u2019s protest. She entered the open, light rain trickling against her face.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>She sat on the curb, pulling the phone out of her pocket as she covered it with her frame. Scrolling aimlessly for a minute, she heard fast footsteps.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cMiss!\u201d Someone called, causing Mina to turn around. A woman stood there, a notebook in hand, \u201cIs that your school uniform? Are you a UA student?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cUh, yes ma\u2019am,\u201d Mina answered, getting up to walk towards her.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The woman sighed in relief, holding the journal out, \u201cUA is written as the return address tag on the inside. There\u2019s no name though. It was left at the park; I think the owner lost it there.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Mina took the small book, flipping to the first page to get a look at it.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Her eyes widened as she read the header, recognizing the handwriting immediately, \u201cI know whose book this is ma\u2019am. I-I\u2019ll get this to him asap!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The woman nodded, waving as she left. Mina, when she was out of sight, tore through the book. There were a dozen empty pages.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>She caught sight of ink in the middle, reading carefully over the lines.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em> Reason #1-100 to Die </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>What?</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em> Reason #2 </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em> Reason #10 </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em> #25, #36, #68, #87, #95 </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>She almost dropped the journal as she read the last line.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em> Reason #100 </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Taking a moment to process what she had seen, she gasped, air stolen from her. She slammed the book shut, scrambling for the entrance to the karaoke bar.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">***</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Pulling the phone away from his ear, Bakugou felt nauseous. His legs were shaking as he leaned over, still on the toilet seat. That voicemail had been there for so long, and he had just ignored it. No wonder Kirishima thought he didn\u2019t care.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cBakugou!\u201d He heard Mina scream as the bathroom door was thrown open so hard the metal slammed against the wall.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat the fuck do you want?\u201d Bakugou grit out, seething. \u201cDidn\u2019t I tell you to stay the fuck away from me!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI think he\u2019s gonna try again! Open the fucking stall!\u201d She yelled, acid burning through the lock.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Suddenly, they were face to face, Mina on her knees, \u201cLook!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>She shoved a notebook in front of his eyes, and he squinted to read it.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em> Reasons To Die: 1-100.\u00a0 </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Reasons to Die? Why was Eijiirou looking for reasons to die?</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Then, the realization caught up to him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He ripped the book away in horror, flipping through the pages in a panic. He scanned over the ink, searching desperately for something he didn\u2019t want to find.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He found it anyways.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><em> Reason #100 to Die: </em> <strong> <em> \u00a0Bakugou deserves better.\u00a0 </em> </strong></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Breathing heavy, Bakugou stood, shoulders slamming into the side of the stall. This was why he had been acting so weird, wasn\u2019t it? He was planning on killing himself.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em> I won\u2019t be around tomorrow. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He felt boneless, eyes wide as he reread the reason a dozen times. Suddenly, he was shaken by pink hands.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll go get Aizawa, but you need to get to the school right now!\u201d Mina said, looking just as terrified as him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Nodding, he pushed his way out of the stall, running as fast as he could to the entrance.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cKacchan!\u201d Deku yelled as he passed him. The kids stood up in concern all muttering.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He ignored them, shoving open the door with a force that shattered the glass.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He took off for UA.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">***</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Stumbling up the stairs, Bakugou climbed them as fast as he could. He was panting, sweating tremendously as he finally burst through the floor\u2019s door.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He made a beeline for Kirishima\u2019s door, trying the handle only to be stopped by the lock.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cFuck!\u201d He yelled, kicking it harshly, \u201cOpen the door. Kirishima! Open the fucking door!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>When he didn\u2019t get an answer, he tried to blow off the lock. His first attempt was unsuccessful, but his second, much bigger explosion, blasted the door wide open.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Waving away the smoke, he tore into the room, searching everywhere for a sign of life.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He spotted a body on the floor.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Falling to his knees, he crawled over to Kirishima, noticing the very shallow breathing.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, no, no,\u201d Bakugou repeated, pulling Kirishima into his lap. \u201cFuck! Come on, you can\u2019t do this to me!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He slapped his face lightly, glossy eyes rolling around some to find his gaze, \u201cKirishima! Goddamnit, wake up!\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He looked around furiously for Kirishima\u2019s phone, since his was now dead. His eyes trailing every inch of the space around him. Bakugou noticed that his shirt felt increasingly wet, and he looked down to see the spreading of crimson on the fabric.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Trying to think quickly, he yanked the comforter off the bed, pressing it down onto the wounds, \u201cKirishima. Kiri. Eijirou!\u201d He pleaded, rocking them back and forth in a panic.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m... sorry,\u201d He muttered, voice weak, \u201cm\u2019 tired.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou can sleep when I get you to Recovery Girl, okay?\u201d Bakugou reassured, trying to calm him down by running his violently shaking fingers through his hair. \u201cCan you wait? I need you to stay awake.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kirishima looked at him, staring softly, \u201cDid I\u2026 turn off the water?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bakugou pulled him closer, hugging him tightly, \u201cThe water?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThe faucet. Mom will get mad,\u201d he coughed, breathing ragged and hoarse. \u201cI don\u2019t want her to\u2026 yell at me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cShe wouldn\u2019t,\u201d Bakugou said, still searching for his phone, \u201cYour mom won\u2019t care as long as you - fuck! - stay awake to tell her it was an accident.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kirishima shook his head, \u201cI wanna sleep. Let me go to bed.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNot if you\u2019re not going to fucking wake up!\u201d Bakugou cried, grabbing his face with bloody hands.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHey,\u201d Kirishima said, looking sober for the first time since Bakugou had found him, \u201cwhy are you mad?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bakugou sobbed, fingers running through black hair again, \u201cYou\u2019re going to die. You\u2019re going to die.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Trying to return the comfort, Kirishima snuggled closer to his chest, \u201cYou\u2019ll be okay.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou don\u2019t understand!\u201d Bakugou wailed, bending down to be closer to him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He wanted to take in his heat while he still could.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cPlease. I don\u2019t want to be alone,\u201d he whimpered, pulling Kirishima up just a little. \u201cStay with me. Eijirou, please stay.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kirishima simply hummed, \u201cI\u2019m sorry for\u2026 not telling you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cFor not telling me what?\u201d Bakugou asked, glancing up to see the reflection of the phone screen just barely under the bed. Panicking, he tried to reach for it, only to feel a hand on his wrist.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bakugou couldn\u2019t bring himself to look down at the arm.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI love you,\u201d Kirishima said, clear through the haze.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Looking at him, Bakugou whispered, \u201cWhat?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve loved you since,\u201d he wheezed, arms falling, \u201csince first year at Kamino, but I didn\u2019t want to get in the way. I know you\u2019re going to be a great hero and I would\u2019ve held you back.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bakugou stared at him, eyes ablaze as he bent over. He finally got his hands on the phone, fingers slipping a couple of times from the wet blood, \u201cFuck you. Take it back right now!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d It was Kirishima\u2019s turn to be confused.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou don\u2019t get to say that! Not right now! Tell me you love me when I\u2019m not covered in your fucking blood. Tell me later!\u201d He screamed, frantically trying to open his lock screen.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kirishima smiled softly, \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s going to be a later, Katsuki.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cStop it!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI just wanted you to-,\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cShut up and let me save you!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d Kirishima said, rubbing his thumb against the other\u2019s chest.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bakugou shook his head, searching for Aizawa\u2019s number, \u201cIt\u2019s not okay! None of this is okay!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kirishima grimaced, body trembling, \u201cI thought death was supposed to be\u2026 peaceful. Why am I in so much pain?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He sighed, hand seizing Bakugou\u2019s wrist again to stop its movement. He looked up through tear-soaked eyelashes, \u201cHey, Katsuki? Will you kiss me?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHuh?\u201d Bakugou uttered, finger over the call button.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI know you don\u2019t want to but I\u2026\u201d Kirishima\u2019s calm demeanor broke, \u201cI don\u2019t want to die without knowing what it felt like to be yours. Even if it\u2019s fake and only a moment. It\u2019ll be enough.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bakugou looked between him and the phone, unable to control his breathing. His heart was pounding hard in his chest, rib cage rattling.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>This might be his only chance. He couldn\u2019t leave all of this - all of them - an unknown.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He pressed the call button, leaning down to smash their lips together. Kirishima let out a small grunt, eyes widening at the contact. The kiss was nasty, laced with the bitterness of pills and copper, but Bakugou pressed on, eyes closed as tears fell from them. He threaded his fingers through his hair, pulling Kirishima\u2019s head up for a better angle.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>And then Kirishima\u2019s lips weren\u2019t moving anymore.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>His hand fell to the ground with a soft thud as the call clicked to life.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAizawa!\u201d He screamed, hearing his echo through the phone, \u201cMr. Aizawa, please! Get someone to send Recovery Girl up to Kirishima\u2019s dorm!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>There was a grunt on the other end of the call, \u201cI can\u2019t h-.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cRecovery Girl! Kirishima\u2019s room!\u201d Bakugou huffed out, lightly tapping his friend's face, \u201cC\u2019mon. Wake up!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>A noise of understanding carried over the waves, and the line went dead. Dropping the phone, he turned his attention back to Kirishima.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bakugou desperately shook him, hands on his face as he whispered, \u201cWake up. Eijirou, please get up.\u201d Kirishima didn\u2019t move, his chest was completely still. Putting his ear up to Kirishima's mouth, he realized there was no sound of breathing. His skin was beginning to pale.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He racked his brain for what to do, all the lessons for his First Aide class flying out the window as he looked at his cold body. Sobbing, he wrapped Kirishima up as tight as he could, muttering tiny words he didn\u2019t know he was speaking.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIt was real,\u201d Bakugou whispered, rocking Kirishima back and forth in his arms as he waited. He pressed soft kisses to his temple, tears falling onto unknowing skin, \u201cIt was real.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>After a moment of wailing into Kirishima\u2019s chest, everything flooded back to him. \u201cRescue breathing,\u201d he muttered, pulling away from Kirishima. He tried to move his hands, but they seemed to be stuck.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kirishima made a deep gurgling noise, and Bakugou sprung into action. He went through everything a hundred times; pinch nose, breathe air into his dead lungs, and repeat. His arms and airways were screaming with fatigue.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It felt like he did it forever, no air left to give, when he was pulled off by Aizawa. Thrashing, he tried to make his way back to Kirishima. Reaching desperately, his red-hot hands were pulled back.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>His eyes were open, but he couldn\u2019t see anything. \u201cIs he breathing? Aizawa\u00a0<em> please\u00a0 </em>tell me he\u2019s breathing!\u201d He screamed, still kicking against the hold. There were small pops from under his fingers.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Aizawa was talking, but he couldn\u2019t hear him, everything muffled in his tired ears. Vaguely, he could see two people standing over Kirishima, speaking something inaudible to Bakugou as they gestured widely.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He gave up his fight, sinking back into his teacher\u2019s hold as he sobbed violently, screaming just to\u00a0<em> hear\u00a0 </em>something.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Aizawa kept his grip tight, whispering to the trembling boy, \u201cYou did what you could kid. This isn\u2019t your fault.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Exhausted, Bakugou stilled completely, almost blacking out in his teacher's grasp as his eyes rolled backward. \u201cAizawa, tell me he\u2019s alive. Please. Please,\u201d he kept repeating it like it was a sick prayer.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Aizawa watched as they loaded Kirishima onto the stretcher, the boy still completely limp. His skin was almost blue now, veins visible.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He covered Bakugou\u2019s eyes with his hand.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWe have a pulse but no breathing!\u201d Aizawa caught, trying to listen into the conversation. Bakugou\u2019s cries were drowning out most of the noise. There was some more yelling, and just like that, they rushed him out of the room, missing the door like experts.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The room seemed so empty without Kirishima\u2019s body.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Then, Bakugou's cries stopped with a whisper, and his teacher looked down to see him unconscious against his chest. Stricken, Aizawa simply sat there, trembling softly as he held his student close.</p>\n<p>\n<strong> <em> Hey Eijirou,\u00a0 </em> </strong>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<strong> <em> I don\u2019t know why I keep calling.

Maybe it\u2019s some sick twisted way to make myself understand what this summer was like for you.\u00a0 </em> </strong>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">***</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The hospital was far too cold. Something about it felt wrong, that endless chill and weird smell. It felt like the place where people die.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Well, that was obviously because they\u00a0<em>did, </em>\u00a0but Bakugou didn\u2019t want to think about that right now.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He was huddled against one of those awful fucking chairs, with the color patterns that completely contrasted against the white tile and walls. Aizawa had given him his jacket earlier, but it didn\u2019t seem to stop the trembling. His clothes were dry, the blood had crusted against his stomach, but he couldn\u2019t take it off. Eijirou was on this fabric, and if he never saw him again then\u2026</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>This bloody shirt is all he would have left.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>His eyes had been shut for an eternity, but he couldn\u2019t sleep. The moment kept replaying over and over again.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Open the door, find Kirishima, hold him, kiss him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em> Watch him stop breathing. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Shaking his head furiously, he listened to the distant beeps and chatter, wondering how the world could simply continue along like his best friend wasn\u2019t dying a couple of rooms away. It felt like the only thing that should matter to anyone right now.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He peered over to his right, finally opening his eyes, to where Kirishima\u2019s parents were speaking to a doctor. From the lack of emotional screaming, Bakugou could gather that, at the very least, Kirishima wasn\u2019t dead.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The clasping of his father\u2019s hand over his mouth as he looked away, however, did not make Bakugou feel confident it would remain that way.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Stuck in his little seat in the waiting room, Bakugou did just that. He waited.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He strained his ears to hear whatever the doctor was saying, but it was useless. It was unlikely that his parents would tell him either.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>His mother had looked so hateful<em>\u00a0</em>when she had seen him. He probably deserved it; his silence had contributed to Kirishima\u2019s downfall. Still, he wished he could convince them that he was trying<em>\u00a0</em>to make things better.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>His phone buzzed in his pocket for the millionth time, fingers trembling as finally reached for it. He had ignored it forever, refusing to see whatever soft and shitty messages his friends had left. When he looked now, he could see the dozens of calls and the hundreds, yes\u00a0<em> hundreds </em>, of texts the idiots had left him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Forgetting about all of that, he opened the phone app again; the number had climbed to an amount he had forgotten. Finding his target, he pulled the phone up to his ear.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em> \u201cOut of all the reasons to stay, you were my favorite.\u201d </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kirishima had been laying on the bedroom floor, dying, in this message. Bakugou had been out with his friends despite the awful feeling he had left with. He ignored it, ignored Kirishima.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em> \u201cOut of all the reasons to stay, you were my favorite.\u201d </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Why did he sound so fucking happy? He must have wanted to die so badly for him to sound so euphoric while his lungs were slowly shutting down.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em> \u201cOut of all the reasons to stay, you were my favorite.\u201d </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He kept replaying it, scared he would lose what little pieces he still had left if he didn\u2019t.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em> \u201cOut of all the reasons to stay, you were my favorite.\u201d </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em> \u201cOut of all the reasons to stay, you were my favorite.\u201d </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em> \u201cOut of all the reasons to stay, you were my favorite.\u201d </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>There was a hand on his shoulder.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He didn\u2019t look up. He should\u2019ve, even if it was just to get a peek at whoever was standing above him, but he didn\u2019t have the energy. Everything felt so heavy.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cBakugou,\u201d Isamu said, bending down to the boy\u2019s eye line. Bakugou\u2019s eyes widened, falling forward a bit.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Isamu didn\u2019t recognize this kid as his son\u2019s best friend. That boy had been so fiery, a proud livewire with something to prove. He had laughed loudly and banged his fists on walls and caught everyone\u2019s attention.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He seemed so small now.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He shivered, leaning into the steadiness of Isamu\u2019s hand as he swayed. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he rasped, chest rattling as he breathed in. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Isamu had to look away, afraid he would lose what little composure he had left. Holding him up, he smiled. \u201cEijirou is alive. Do you hear me? He\u2019s alive.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bakugou nodded slowly, \u201cI know.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s here because of you,\u201d Isamu said, moving his hands to cup the boy\u2019s face. \u201cDo you know that?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bakugou cocked his head, tired eyes scanning his face, \u201cWhat?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Isamu choked, glancing down for a moment, \u201cHe- He would be brain dead right now if you hadn\u2019t tried to resuscitate him.\u201d He switched knees, the one planted on the tile becoming stiff, \u201cEijrou would\u2019ve been missing oxygen for too long, and\u2026 he wouldn\u2019t be here right now.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He tried to push him away, \u201cIt wasn\u2019t enough. I should\u2019ve noticed.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHe came to our house too, Bakugou. I saw him and I thought he was happy, just like you,\u201d Isamu admitted, hands still on the boy. \u201cHe tricked us too. I don\u2019t think he wanted us to know anything was wrong. You saved him Bakugou, even when he didn\u2019t want to be\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t let him die,\u201d Bakugou muttered, and Isamu could see the tears forming, \u201cnot before I-.\u201d He sobbed, \u201cI didn\u2019t get to tell him. I didn\u2019t get to tell him.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He cried, falling into strong arms that reminded him far too much of his best friend. Isamu gripped him tight, pulling him onto the floor with him. He held Bakugou like he was his own son, far too afraid it might be the last time he ever did something like this.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Aoi watched from the side, black book in hand.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">***</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Midoriya and Ochako sat on the couch, the place far too quiet. Nobody had really said anything since they had found out what happened. Although Aizawa had made up excuses for what had taken place, Deku and Ochako knew.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat if he dies?\u201d Ochako whispered, staring at him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He closed his eyes, \u201cHe won\u2019t.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIzuku,\u201d Ochako tried, grabbing his wrist, \u201cyou know that might not be true.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He slumped back into the couch, scared hands on his brow, \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Ochako looked away, fingers fiddling with the toothpick, the shark\u2019s eyes staring back at her. She wished she could tuck it in raven hair again.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Midoriya sighed, trying his best to stay strong. That endless lump in his throat just kept getting bigger.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat if he doesn\u2019t wake up?\u201d He muttered, feeling wet tears track his cheeks. \u201cWhat if yesterday was the last time we ever see him?\u201d Waving his hands around furiously, he pulled away from her, \u201cI was supposed to know! I knew what it was like and I didn\u2019t notice! I pulled all the same fucking tricks and I\u00a0<em> failed\u00a0 </em>to realize what he was doing.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Ochako reached out to him, trying to comfort him the best she could. \u201cIzuku, no. That was the whole point, for people not to notice.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cBut I knew!\u201d He yelled, scrambling to the other side of the couch. \u201cI know all about being suicidal and I didn\u2019t notice!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Ochako gripped him tight, pulling him into her chest, \u201cIt wasn\u2019t your fault.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, it-.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t your fault. You didn\u2019t know,\u201d She coaxed.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cBut I sho-.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>She cut him off by shoving her phone in his face. On it was a picture of the four of them, Kirishima, Bakugou, Midoriya, and her. She was holding up the phone for a selfie, eyes wide as Bakugou pointed a thumb behind them, looking rather amused. There, right under his finger, Kirishima and Midoriya were watching the trailer for that new hero-based fighting game. They both looked far too excited, hands on each other as they watched in awe.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He had just been excited to buy another game with All Might in it, but Kirishima had been waiting for one that included Crimson Riot forever. They had been fanboying hard, pulling on each other and yelling every time their favorite heroes had crossed the screen.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou made him happy,\u201d Ochako insisted, running a hand through his hair. \u201cWe are his friends, and that has to count for something.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Taking the phone from her, Midoriya scrolled through the album, all the pictures were moments with Kirishima in them. Getting boba, game nights, and both of them crying during movies.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He sobbed, burying himself in Ochako\u2019s lap as he cried.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>She let the tears fall silently.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">***</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>After hours of arguing with Aoi, Isamu finally convinced her to let Bakugou into Kirishima\u2019s room. The blonde had been reluctant at first, afraid he was stepping on the pair\u2019s feet. Isamu could tell how important it was to the boy and insisted he visit, even if it was only for a bit.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>So there he was, leaning over the railing as he ran fingers through black hair. He stared at Kirishima\u2019s far too pale face, \u201cDid they say\u2026 anything about when he\u2019ll wake up.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Aoi, patience thin, clenched her fist, \u201cThe bigger concern is\u00a0<em> if </em>\u00a0he\u2019ll wake up.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Pausing his actions, Bakugou looked over, \u201cWhat?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAoi,\u201d Isamu tried.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s brain is swollen and his body is weak. They\u2019re trying to get the swelling to go down with medicine, but it doesn\u2019t seem to be working,\u201d Aoi said, anger harsh in her voice.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd if it doesn\u2019t work?\u201d Bakugou asked quietly, eyes on Kirishima.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNormally, they would put him in a coma, but it seems the overdose did that anyway,\u201d she said, sucking in a breath. \u201cYour efforts lessened the effects of the lack of oxygen, but it still did a number on him.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Isamu tried to reach for his wife, but she pulled away. \u201cIf anything more happens, the brain swelling gets worse, he gets an infection, or his body is put under any kind of stress, he\u2019ll probably die.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bakugou opened his mouth to say something but was cut off. \u201cHe could go into cardiac arrest and die! He could have a stroke and die! He could breathe wrong and die! Who fucking knows,\u201d Aoi yelled, stepping closer to him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>There was a skip in the beeping of the machine beside them, and everyone turned to it to make sure it was a fluke.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI can\u2019t do this,\u201d Aoi said, walking to the door. She pushed through it, followed by Isamu\u2019s signs.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bakugou stayed silent, bringing his focus back to Kirishima.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cShe hates me,\u201d he whispered, causing Isamu to look at him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s not true kid,\u201d he assured, patting his shoulder lightly.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bakugou sniffled, \u201cShe should. I\u2019m the reason he\u2019s in here, aren\u2019t I?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He stared at Kirishima\u2019s dad, movements lifeless, \u201cI was trying to make things better, but it didn\u2019t work. I\u2019m a failure. I failed your son.\u201d Bakugou wiped at his face, \u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t you hate me?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, actually,\u201d Isamu said, looking at the book in his hands, \u201cyou were seven of the reasons he\u2019s in here, though three of them you couldn\u2019t have prevented.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He held the journal out, flipped to the first page, to Bakugou, who took it hesitantly, \u201cbut, you\u2019re also sixty-four of the reasons he wanted to stay.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Scanning the paper, he realized there was a list he hadn\u2019t<em>\u00a0</em>seen. He read through some of the reasons.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<strong> <em> Reason #2 to Live: I found all those pictures I took for the corkboard.

He tried his best to catch his breath as leaned down to kiss his cheek, straining against the railing. Sobbing against Kirishima\u2019s skin, his knees felt like they were going to give.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOut of all the reasons to stay, you were my favorite,\u201d he whispered, stroking his face gently.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Isamu suddenly felt like an intruder in his own son\u2019s room. He rubbed Bakugou\u2019s back, \u201cI\u2019ll give you some time alone, okay?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He nodded, still glued to Kirishima\u2019s side. Isamu walked out, taking a final glance back.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bakugou looked over his shoulder out into the hall that reeked of alcohol and death, searching for anyone important. When he saw no one, he caved, pushing down the side railing of the bed and crawling on. He kicked his shoes off as he sat down on the bed, lured in by Kirishima\u2019s steady breathing helped by the machine.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He scanned his face as he turned around, eyes catching on the tube down his throat. His lips were parted open to allow access, and he wished harder than anything he could kiss them until they started to speak.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Trailing his finger over Kirishima\u2019s cheek, he began to sob, ugly and loud. He threw himself down onto Kirishima\u2019s chest, burying his face into the gown as he desperately gripped at his sleeve, arm cast over his body.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kirishima didn\u2019t awake, not even as the bed shook from Bakugou cries. He pressed soft kisses onto Kirishima\u2019s jaw as he sobbed, trying to catch his breath.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cPlease. Please wake up. Don\u2019t leave me here,\u201d He wailed, hiding in the crook of Kirishima\u2019s neck.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>There was silence.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI love you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">***</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy are you being nice to him?\u201d Aoi growled, up in her husband\u2019s space.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Isamu sighed, tilting his head, \u201cbecause that\u2019s what Kirishima would want.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>She took a step back, thrown off guard, \u201cWhat?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHe loves that kid, Aoi,\u201d He reasoned, looking at the ground, \u201cHe adores him.

He\u2019s trying to be better.\u201d Isamu leaned against the wall, sliding down it. The tears he had been holding back finally appeared, \u201cIf Bakugou failed Kirishima, then so did we. He got the pills from our house, and they were from my surgery.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s not the same!\u2019 Aoi said, squatting down with him, \u201cBakugou was the reason the first one happened!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNo!\u201d Isamu yelled, \u201cYou\u2019re mad, and I get it, I\u2019m mad too, but you can\u2019t just blame everything on one kid! His friend\u2019s fucked him up, that school fucked him up, us not\u00a0<em> understanding\u00a0</em>when he tried to tell us fucked him up.

Then, she spotted Bakugou, curled up against Kirishima, asleep but shivering.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>She approached them softly, careful to keep quiet. She wanted to hate this kid so badly for everything he had done. For this summer, for the long nights of comfort she\u2019d given Kirishima at the beginning of their friendship, and for being the hundredth reason. Looking at him now, however, she couldn\u2019t bring himself to do it.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>If Eijirou could love him, then she would try to as well. Pulling a blanket out of her overnight bag, she rested over the two, Bakugou huddling in closer at the warmth.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>She kissed her son\u2019s forehead. When she pulled away, she noticed Kirishima\u2019s hands. They were wrapped in Bakugou\u2019s. Sighing, she tried her best to let go of the anger.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>She pressed a quick kiss to Bakugou\u2019s temple too, tucking the blanket in tighter.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">***</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<strong> <em> It sucks.\u00a0 </em> </strong>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<strong> <em> I don\u2019t know how much longer I can listen to those fucking rings.\u00a0 </em> </strong>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<strong> <em> I\u2019m sorry.

Bakugou had learned this in a moment of desperation, the need to be next to Kirishima outweighing everything else. He had broken in during the early hours of the morning, deciding to sleep in his bed.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The place still smelled of pre-workout and barbells, some sage wood mixed in there. Normally, Bakugou would make fun of him for having a room that reeked like a gym, but now he was under his covers, wrapped in Kirishima\u2019s favorite hoodie.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It had been a month since Kirishima\u2019s attempt.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bakugou had decided people who say grief gets better with time were fucking liars. It didn\u2019t help that Kirishima wasn\u2019t dead, just completely comatose.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The doctors kept saying that once the swelling went down they could heal him.

That hope did not exist. That jump in his throat when Isamu called him, the black pit it fell into, that wasn\u2019t the\u00a0<em> hope </em>\u00a0that Eijirou was awake.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It was the\u00a0<em> fear </em>\u00a0that he was dead.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He hadn\u2019t slept in so long.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The entire class had been given a two-week break following Kirishima\u2019s overdose. Thankfully, Aizawa had given him an extension on that time, allowing him to do most of his work online.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He didn\u2019t think he could face the class right now.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Trying his best to break the streak, he closed his eyes, cuddling into the pillow as exhaustion hit him in a wave.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">***</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em> Bakugou was awoken by a soft hand on his cheek, pulling him from slumber.

It doesn\u2019t make sense!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bakugou straightened up, trying his best to screw his head back on.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m mad because I\u2019m looking for reasons to blame myself, and I can\u2019t find any,\u201d she said finally, grabbing her phone. She started to scroll again, \u201cI know I\u2019m in the wrong, but\u2026 apparently Kirishima didn\u2019t believe that, and I can\u2019t figure out why.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Knocking his hands together, Bakugou sighed, \u201cProbably because he already forgave you. Maybe he thought you were right. I don\u2019t know either.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cVery helpful,\u201d she muttered, dragging her finger on the screen again.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bakugou watched her obsessively read back and forth, deciding to stand in her presence for a moment.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He didn\u2019t know what he would do if Kirishima didn\u2019t come back to explain these hanging threads.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">***</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Aoi paced back and forth, watching her husband sleep on the very uncomfortable chair in the corner. His face was pale, very similar to his son\u2019s, and his lips were chapped; his nervous tick of licking them had resurfaced.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The monitor started to pick up the pace, waking Isamu from his nap immediately.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It went off frantically, his heartbeat rattling off the charts as he began to shake violently, chest rising off the bed. Every muscle seemed to tighten, his eyes opening for the first time in weeks only to be completely white.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Aoi went to reach out to him, only to be blocked off by the nurse. \u201cYou should wait outside,\u201d she coaxed, far too nice for the situation at hand.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m going to stay,\u201d she insisted, only to be pulled back by Isamu\u2019s hands. \u201cGet off!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWe need to leave,\u201d he said, using a little force as he could to yank her away.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Aoi thrashed against him, watching as Eijirou collapsed, choking violently even in his state. The heart monitor was still running full speed.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cStop, Isamu, let go!\u201d She screamed, trying to shove him away. The door shut in her face.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">***</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cBakugou,\u201d Aizawa said grimly, phone in hand. \u201cMrs. Kirishima wishes to speak to you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Looking around the lunch table he had just rejoined today, Bakugou got up, walking over to where his teacher was standing. He took the phone, putting it up to his ear.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHello?\u201d He asked, turning away from the group.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cBakugou,\u201d she breathed, the post-crying break obvious in her voice. \u201cI have\u2026 something to tell you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Nervousness filling him, he shifted on his feet, \u201cYes, ma\u2019am.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cListen, Eijirou\u2019s brain swelling is dying down, which means he could wake up soon,\u201d she said, causing Bakugou to perk up.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cR-Really?\u201d He whispered, his lips tugging slightly upwards.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>She coughed, \u201cYes, but\u2026 the pressure was there for so long that its absence is causing issues and,\u201d her sniffle was audible, \u201ctonight might not go so well for him.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bakugou froze, stiff as ice, cold as it too, \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThe chances that\u2026 he, fuck-,\u201d she paused, sucking in a breath, \u201cthat he makes it through the night are really slim.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>His legs gave out, and he hit the floor in a single moment, fingers shaking. Aizawa set his hand on his shoulder, patting him softly. Once he regained his ability to breathe, he spoke again, \u201cBut, you just said he was getting better.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He could hear his classmates muttering behind him, some sounding extremely concerned. Bakugou blocked them out.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHe is, but his body isn\u2019t catching up with his brain,\u201d she said, and Bakugou realized he could hear Isamu crying in the background. \u201cHe\u2019s having seizures, and they\u2019re messing with his heart, which is still really weak.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cBakugou, you might want to come to the hospital.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Still frozen, Bakugou leaned over, feeling like he was going to puke, \u201cAre you saying I should\u2026 say goodbye?\u201d He choked, his words earning a myriad of gasps from the class.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cJust in case,\u201d Aoi supplied, sounding very unsure.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bakugou looked around him, reaching out an arm for Ochako, his closest comfort. She came to him quickly, followed closely by Deku. She rested her head against his back, crying softly as Deku tried to reassure them both.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cCan I bring a couple of... friends? They don\u2019t have to go into the room. I just don't think I can do this alone.\u201d Bakugou rasped, trying to steady himself.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course, dear,\u201d Aoi said, much sweeter than before.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay\u2026 I\u2019ll be there soon,\u201d he said, breathing hard, \u201cGoodbye, Mrs. Kirishima.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cGoodbye, Bakugou,\u201d she replied, and the call clicked off.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bakugou shattered into pieces on the lunchroom floor.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">***</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<strong> <em> Hey Eijirou,\u00a0 </em> </strong>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<strong> <em> I think I just realized why I keep calling\u00a0 </em> </strong>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<strong> <em> It\u2019s because it\u2019s the only time I hear your voice anymore.\u00a0 </em> </strong>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<strong> <em> My name is Eijirou Kirishima!

Aoi and Isamu were standing off to the side, both unable to get any sleep. The possibility that they might wake up without a son was too much to bear.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>There had only been silence for hours, the quiet charged with unescapable nervousness. Something about the room felt incredibly lifeless, from the white walls to Kirishima\u2019s unmoving body. All of these things combined made death feel like it was lurking around the corner.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bakugou had been holding onto unmoving fingers for hours now, waiting for them to twitch even a little.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Aoi watched as his whole arm trembled from exhaustion, the position of it against the bed must\u2019ve been extremely uncomfortable. There was a pang somewhere under her ribs.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou know,\u201d she started, looking at Bakugou, \u201cthe doctor said it was good to talk to him. I don\u2019t know if he meant good for us or good for Eijirou, but it might help.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bakugou nodded slowly, eyes half-closed as he scooted forward some. He laid his head down as close to Kirishima as he could get. He didn\u2019t want to talk, it felt wrong; it felt like he was an intruder in this closed-off room.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Anything had to be better than this.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you remember the night we hung up stars in your room?\u201d Bakugou asked, finger doing a small walking motion up Kirishima\u2019s arm. He\u2019d picked up the habit from Eijirou himself; he did it frequently during study sessions. \u201cYou had to stand on that really unsteady chair you use at your desk, and I told you it wouldn\u2019t work, but you didn\u2019t listen.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He smiled some, \u201cSo when you stood on it, the back gave out and folded on you. You hit the ground so hard I thought you were concussed.\u201d Chuckling lightly, his fingers touched black hair, \u201cAnd when you broke the chair, all the stars fell with you. They landed right on your face. You were just sitting there on the ground laughing, and when I went to check on you\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He brushed those pretty bangs back behind Kirishima\u2019s ear, \u201cThe stars were tangled in your hair. You were smiling, and you looked like a galaxy.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bakugou sniffled, attempting to blink away stray tears; he had cried too much in the last few weeks, \u201cand I realized you were the most beautiful thing I\u2019d ever seen.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know what to say,\u201d Bakugou admitted, still stroking his hair. \u201cI turned the lights off so I could see them glow, and it was perfect,\u201d shaking hands touched cold skin, \u201cyou are perfect, even in the dark.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bakugou tangled their fingers together, bringing them up to kiss them lightly, \u201cIt was the first time you had laughed in so long. I\u2026 I realized I didn\u2019t remember what it sounded like when you were really happy.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhen you get out of here,\u201d he said, ignoring the sinking feeling in his gut, \u201clet\u2019s put them up in my room too, yeah? We\u2019ll stick them to every inch of the ceiling, whatever it takes to see you laugh like that again. And\u2026 I\u2019ll kiss you like I should\u2019ve.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Startled by the sound of sniffling, Bakugou turned to see Aoi and Isamu staring at him, eyes watery. Retracting into himself, he looked away. He held Kirishima\u2019s fingers tighter, jumping when hands fell on his shoulders.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Aoi leaned down next to him, wiping his tears away gently. He worried about his lip, trembling.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she said, causing Bakugou to flinch.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Isamu kneeled on the other side of him, putting a hand on his shaking knee, \u201cBakugou.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He kept his eyes on the ground.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m glad someone like you cares about my boy,\u201d Isamu said, voice filled with hollowness. \u201cI can tell you love him very much.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bakugou shook his head, \u201cbut he doesn\u2019t know that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHe knows,\u201d Isamu said, Bakugou sucking in a harsh breath, \u201cHe\u2019s always known.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He closed his eyes, wishing to taste strawberry protein powder.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>His chest cracked, ribs shifting from the weight of the black hole of grief inside of him, and he fell into Aoi\u2019s body, clutching Isamu\u2019s hand as he desperately searched for comfort in their presence.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">***</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tokoyami looked at the door in front of him, the drying wax filling the sigil perfectly. The petals strew around the floor gave off an interesting odor, but he didn\u2019t mind.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cTokoyami?\u201d Aizawa\u2019s voice came from the other side of the hall.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHello, Mr. Aizawa,\u201d he answered, staying steady as he used his brush to paint on the remaining wax.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Aizawa tapped his foot, \u201cWhat are you doing to Kirishima\u2019s door?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m putting up an old religious sigil of luck. My grandmother taught me about it when I was young,\u201d he answered, completely unphased by the absurdity of the statement.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Aizawa walked closer, cocking his head to get a better look, \u201cWhat kind of sigil?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s one for luck. It is supposed to help expedite one\u2019s wish,\u201d he said, pulling his brush back.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNot to dampen the mood,\u201d Aizawa said, putting a hand on his student\u2019s shoulder, \u201cbut maybe this isn\u2019t the time to encourage Kirishima\u2019s wishes.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tokoyami sighed, looking at him, \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s true.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Aizawa asked, still seeking to understand his student.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t think he wants to die,\u201d he said, stepping back to get a good view, \u201cI think he wants to be happy. He wanted to feel good about himself, but he couldn\u2019t. To him, if he couldn\u2019t be happy, what was the point of living?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Aizawa stared at him, watching as Tokoyami took a keychain out of his pocket and set it in front of the door, \u201cHe didn\u2019t want to die, he just didn\u2019t want to be sad anymore. That was the only way he thought he could make the darkness end.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI think he wants to be better, wishes he could be,\u201d Tokoyami said, brushing his hands off, \u201cand I hope that wish is fulfilled.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Aizawa watched him walk away, head held high.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He looked at the keychain.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">***</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Swinging his legs back and forth, Deku watched as Bakugou stumbled out of the room, hand over his mouth. He sunk to the floor as he made it just outside the hallway, nurses replacing him as they rushed into the room.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Getting up to scramble to the trash can, Bakugou threw up.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Ochako shot out of her seat, running to his side to rub his back gently. Deku noticed the tear tracks, working hard to strain his ears to hear inside the room.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bakugou, finished with expelling his guts, dropped to his knees. Ochako pulled him into a side hug, brushing his bangs away from his sweaty forehead.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHe won\u2019t stop seizing,\u201d he whispered, Deku taking his shaking arms into his hands, \u201che\u2019s going to die, and I can\u2019t watch.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Ochako buried her head in the crook of his neck as he sobbed. Deku leaned on them both, attempting to keep his composure.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It felt like they were there for hours before the door opened again.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Aoi stepped out, tears running down her cheeks.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cBakugou,\u201d she breathed, taking a step towards him, \u201cIt\u2019s okay. He\u2019s okay.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bakugou just cried harder, hands burning holes into Ochako\u2019s jacket.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry,\u201d Aoi said, leaning down beside the trio, \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have let you stay knowing that might happen. Of course, it would affect you this badly.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>She set a hand on his face, as he started to pull himself together, \u201cYou should stay outside until tomorrow. I\u2019ll have the nurses bring you some blankets.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNo!\u201d Bakugou pleaded, removing his hands from Ochako to reach out to her, \u201cI want to stay. I can\u2019t leave him alone. Not again.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Aoi let out a breath, stroking his cheek, \u201cYou\u2019re not. You\u2019ll be right here if he wakes up.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Trying to crawl forward, he begged, \u201cPlease let me stay. Please. I\u2019m sorry for being too weak. I\u2019ll be stronger this time!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t do anything wrong.

Bakugou knew this because he had refused to fall asleep. He had laid there, two chairs moved to form a makeshift bed, and listened. He watched nurses and doctors run in and out of the room.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The idea of waking up without Kirishima here was too much to even think about. So he had stayed up, his eyes glued on the door.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Deku and Ochako had fallen asleep fairly quickly, worn to the bone from the stress of the day. Although Bakugou felt a tinge of guilt when he looked at them, he had to admit he wouldn\u2019t have made it through the night if they hadn\u2019t been here.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bakugou only knew it was daytime because of the clock. The lack of windows meant there was no way to tell when the sun came up, but the hands were on that seven-thirty maker.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He had been waiting patiently for Aoi or Isamu to come to get him, but they hadn\u2019t, and the anxiety was getting to him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Frustrated, Bakugou shoved the blanket off of him. He stood on tired legs, his vision swaying from the exhaustion. Breathing in deep to escape the blurriness, Bakugou walked towards the room.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He noticed the curtains were pulled closed and the lights were off. Knocking on the door lightly, it was immediately swung open.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Isamu, looking like a dead man walking, was staring at him. \u201cBakugou,\u201d he said, trying to pull on a smile, \u201cgood morning.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cMorning,\u201d he responded, trying to look behind him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Isamu glanced back, \u201cAh, don\u2019t worry. He\u2019s still there.\u201d He grimaced, body falling into the door.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThe doctors came in,\u201d Bakugou said, shifting on his feet, \u201cdoes that mean they were able to heal him?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSome,\u201d Isamu responded, still putting his weight on the wood, \u201cbut his heart stopped a couple of times too, that\u2019s why they came in.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bakugou understood why Isamu was holding onto the heavy oakwood for dear life. There was a rumbling of nausea in his gut at the realization that they had all watched Kirishima die. The fact that his death was a shared experience felt like a bag of rocks on his chest.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cBut,\u201d Isamu said, sighing, \u201che is doing better. They\u2019re not sure if the seizures will ever stop, but his heart is healthy enough that they were able to do some major repairs a few hours ago. He hasn\u2019t had an episode since. They\u2019re pretty sure he\u2019ll wake up sometime today.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cCan I see him?\u201d Bakugou asked, hand moving as he subconsciously reached forward.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Aoi appeared behind Isamu in the darkness, flicking on the light switch, \u201cI hate to leave Eijirou alone, but we really need to eat.\u201d She smiled at him warmly, \u201cI think we can trust you to watch him while we\u2019re gone.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bakugou nodded furiously, itching to see him, \u201cOf course! I\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Aoi said, kissing Isamu\u2019s shoulder, \u201clet\u2019s go get some food dear. It\u2019s been a whole day since we\u2019ve eaten.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Isamu nodded, patting Bakugou\u2019s shoulder gently as he walked by. Aoi gave him a small wave as well.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bakugou made his way into the room as fast as he could, eyes finding Kirishima\u2019s body immediately. Even after facing death, he looked relatively the same. His eyes were still closed, though the breathing tube that had been in his throat was removed. His lips were parted, chest moving on its own. There was just a small tube connected to his nose now.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Sighing in relief, Bakugou walked over to him. Even before he\u2019d gotten close, he noticed the tangles in Kirishima\u2019s hair. It was understandable, he had spent most of the night thrashing around, his hair shoved up against the pillow.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bakugou looked back at Aoi\u2019s overnight bag. Trying to be careful, he went through it, pulling out a black hairbrush. He walked back over to Kirishima, flipping the brush around. Not wanting to hurt him, he set him up a little, trying his best not to jostle him as he climbed in behind his back.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kirishima didn\u2019t stir, even as Bakugou pulled his knees up to keep him steady. His limp body laid against Bakugou, his head falling back against his shoulder. Shifting his position, Bakugou ran the brush gently through his hair, careful not to pull too hard.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Brushing his hair seemed stupid, Kirishima probably wouldn\u2019t mind that his hair was tangled when he woke up, but Bakugou felt useful for once. He was fixing a problem, and that was good enough for him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kirishima shifted some, Bakugou freezing when he made a small noise. He stared at him, waiting for anything else to happen. He didn\u2019t move anymore, face completely still.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Sitting back, Bakugou continued to brush his hair. He watched the black strands part under the bristles. They looked so soft, and Bakugou ran a hand through the detangled mess. He pulled Kirishima back all the way, ignoring the pressure his body put on his chest. He hugged him a little, kissing his temple tenderly.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Moving out from behind him, Bakugou planted his feet back on the floor. Trying to think of what to do, he pulled up a chair, sitting down.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He was still very tired, his head resting against the back of the seat. He kept his gaze on Kirishima\u2019s face, watching as his eyelids twitched. He leaned forward, looking back to see if Isamu or Aoi were anywhere near.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kirishima\u2019s eyes opened slowly, still partially rolled back as he tried to block out the light. His head rocked around a bit, his neck aching from the lack of movement.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bakugou shot up, leaning on the railing as he breathed out of a laugh of disbelief, \u201cKirishima! Holy fuck! Eijirou!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Still blinking, he attempted to move his eyes over to the blonde. Suddenly, there were hands on his face turning him towards Bakugou, skin soft as velvet.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re awake,\u201d he laughed, pressing a kiss to his lips, stealing a small whine from Kirishima. Then, he devolved into sobs, \u201cYou\u2019re awake.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He leaned over the bed, peppering him with light kisses which were barely reciprocated in Kirishima\u2019s weary state. His tired hand rested against Bakugou\u2019s side</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Gripping him tightly, he reached for the call nurse button, pressing it as leaned into Kirishima\u2019s touch.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kirishima laughed lightly, eyes barely open, \u201cThe afterlife is so... nice.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bakugou\u2019s joy was drained from him as he pulled away, \u201cWhat?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s so nice here,\u201d he sighed, rubbing Bakugou\u2019s arm with his finger. \u201cThis is perfect. It\u2019s everything I ever wanted.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cEijirou,\u201d Bakugou whispered, brushing his bangs away, \u201cYou\u2019re not dead.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kirishima stilled under his touch, \u201cWhat?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re not dead,\u201d Bakugou said again.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cY-Yeah I am,\u201d Kirishima insisted, becoming a bit panicked.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, you\u2019re not,\u201d Bakugou repeated.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The heart rate chart began to beep rapidly, and Bakugou was shoved off the bed. He watched Kirishima\u2019s frantic eyes search his surroundings, \u201cNo. No. No!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He tore at the chest pads, ripping the adhesive away as the nurse finally entered the room. \u201cI did it this time! It worked!\u201d Kirishima wailed, thrashing on the bed as the nurse took in the situation.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Terrified, Bakugou slotted himself in between the nurse and a panting Kirishima. He stroked his face as the nurse turned his attention to the cabinet. He retrieved a syringe as Bakugou coaxed Kirishima\u2019s trembling form, \u201cOi! Eijirou! You have to calm down!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNo! I\u2019m a failure!\u201d he wailed, trying to push Bakugou away.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bakugou grabbed his hands, placing them against his face, \u201cFuck, Eijirou, look at me!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kirishima stared at him as the nurse plunged the needle into the IV. Bakugou kissed his hands as Kirishima\u2019s breathing slowed, \u201cI\u2019m glad your alive idiot. I\u2019m glad you failed.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He sunk back into the pillows, red eyes trying desperately to focus on Bakugou as he started to descend into a light state, brain fuzzy from the drugs.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI can\u2019t do anything right,\u201d he whispered, the chemicals preventing him from crying as hard as he wanted to. \u201cI can\u2019t even kill myself properly.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Collapsing against the bed, his body too weak to keep him upright, Bakugou choked, \u201cStop saying that shit.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cBut it\u2019s true,\u201d Kirishima breathed, eyes rolling back some. \u201cHow can I be a hero when I\u2019m like this?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cCan\u2019t I just enjoy the fact that you\u2019re alive for a couple of fucking minutes!\u201d Bakugou screamed, earning a pointed look from the nurse. His fire died down some, \u201cYou\u2019ve been awake for a fucking moment and you\u2019re already concerned about throwing yourself back off the cliff! Just stop!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kirishima opened his mouth to say something, only for the door to swing open again. Aoi and Isamu stood there, both pausing as they took in the sight before them.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cEijirou?\u201d Aoi rasped, dropping her coffee onto the floor.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kirishima reached out, now fully under the effects of whatever was in the needle, \u201cMama?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cEijirou!\u201d she repeated, by his side in a flash. Bakugou backed off, letting his parents have their space. Isamu kissed his son\u2019s forehead as Kirishima wrapped his hand in his shirt, mumbling out apologies to both of his parents.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bakugou suddenly felt very out of place, the room closing in on him as he watched the scene. Kirishima didn\u2019t look at him or acknowledge his presence.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He suddenly felt very guilty.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bakugou's first response to Kirishima\u2019s stress was anger. He had yelled at him right after he\u2019d awoken from countless nights of being in a coma. After that, he expected Kirishima to want to talk to him? What an idiot.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kirishima\u2019s focus shouldn\u2019t upset him, he had almost died. His parents deserved time with him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>And Bakugou did not.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Backing out of the room, he made his way back to his friends, still asleep on their doubled-up chairs. He wanted to shake them awake but quickly decided against it. They deserved to sleep more.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Sinking against the wall, he grabbed the blanket off the chair. Covering himself with it, he rested his back on the plaster. With guilt slithering through his stomach, he put his head in his hands and cried.</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p align=\"center\">***</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b> <em>I\u2019m looking up at the stars right now.</em> </b>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<b> <em>\u2026</em> </b>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<b> <em>Goodnight, Eijirou.</em> </b>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Time is weird. Not in the sense that Bakugou didn\u2019t understand it, he understood it perfectly fine. It still pissed him off though, that constant drag he was unable to blast to pieces. Time marched on, Bakugou pulled behind it by an unbreakable chain looped around his neck. He would stumble and fall, snub his nose in the dirt and scrape his knees.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>And life would continue.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bakugou hadn\u2019t spoken to Kirishima in two months.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Time didn\u2019t care that it hurt, that every day he woke up to no missed calls or texts felt like a stab to the gut. If it did, it would pause. It would stop and let him sprint around the world to find Kirishima, track him down to some nook or fucking cranny and hold him until time restarted.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>But it wouldn\u2019t, because it didn\u2019t care.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>As the leaves turned red, a color he wished he could see somewhere else, Bakugou pulled away from the class. He still spoke to Deku and Ochako, kept up tabs with Denki and Sero, and sometimes sent a hateful message to Mina that was returned with the same spite, but it was different.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>UA had given them a small break for fall, Bakugou barricaded in the house since his parents had left for a fashion show.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He sat in his bedroom, eyes cast up at the ceiling looking at the stars. Checking his phone for the hundredth time, he pressed his lips together, the frustration gurgling in the back of his throat. No notifications, same as always.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He didn\u2019t complain about the silence, he had never expected Kirishima to forgive him in the first place. He sometimes wondered if his friend even remembered the words they exchanged when he awoke. If he did, the silence had to be indicative of the hate he held for him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Turning over onto his side, he buried his head into his pillow, clutching the phone to his chest. His lungs felt full as he drowned under a wave of guilt. Without an escape, he simply resigned himself to laying in bed forever.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He heard the doorbell ring, perking up some as he sat up. It rang again, sending Bakugou out of bed and shuffling down the stairs. Making his way to the front door, past the living room and kitchen, he turned the handle and pulled.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Deku and Ochako stood there, woven basket in hand as they smiled wildly.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Bakugou said, trying to close the door.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cCome on!\u2019 We have goodies!\u201d Ochako protested, holding up the basket so he could see its contents. There was chocolate, different types of mochi, and spicy hard candy.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Deku put his hand out, stopping the door from closing, \u201cand we came to talk about Kirishima.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Pausing, Bakugou slowly reopened the door, grimacing at the brightness of the duo. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about Kirishima and then you\u2019re leaving,\u201d he mumbled, ripping the basket from Ochako\u2019s hands.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cGeez,\u201d she said, putting her palms up, \u201cfine.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDidn\u2019t you hear? Kirishima should be returning to school after break!\u201d Deku said, leaning forward as he pushed past Bakugou. Stunned, he moved back as the two invaded his home.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHe said he\u2019s doing a lot better!\u201d Ochako also said, plopping herself on the couch as if she lived there.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The pit in his stomach bubbled, making Bakugou feel nauseous as he shut the door, \u201cCool.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cCool?\u201d Ochako questioned as he set the basket down on the coffee table. \u201cCome on! He\u2019s been gone for months! I thought you\u2019d be excited.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bakugou shrugged, \u201cSure, I guess.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Deku sighed, sinking next to Ochako as they both noticed the soda he\u2019d stolen from the fridge while they were talking, \u201cKacchan, I\u2019m sure it\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say shit,\u201d Bakugou growled, causing Deku to roll his eyes.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cBoys,\u201d Ochako said, moving between them, \u201ccan\u2019t we enjoy the fact our friend is coming back to school soon without arguing?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>They both looked away, arms crossed.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy are you <em>here </em>though?\u201d Bakugou asked, his eyes on a shitty painting on the wall.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cBecause,\u201d Ochako grumbled, \u201cbecause you haven\u2019t talked to us in a while. We wanted to see how you were.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bakugou scoffed, stalking off towards the stairs, \u201cFuck this, I\u2019m going to bed.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIt is two in the afternoon, even your old man bedtime isn\u2019t that early,\u201d Ochako responded, watching as he flipped her off over his shoulder.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWe can\u2019t talk about Kirishima\u2019s phone call if you're in bed,\u201d Deku said, grabbing the remote to turn on the TV.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Making a long noise of frustration, he paused again only a stair up, \u201cStop teasing me you fucking nerd!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not,\u201d Deku said, \u201cI spoke to him on the phone a couple of hours ago.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Realizing what that meant, Bakugou didn\u2019t move from his spot, \u201cHe spoke to you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, why?\u201d Deku questioned, looking over the couch.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>His chest felt heavy, tension crushing his shoulders as he grasped the railing, \u201cI didn\u2019t think he was talking to anyone.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Ochako asked, squinting at him, \u201cHe\u2019s called everyone in our class. Has he not called you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bakugou felt his muscles relaxing as he became numb, \u201cNo.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d Ochako said, glancing at Deku, \u201cI\u2019m so sorry. We didn\u2019t-.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhatever,\u201d he mumbled, knocking his knuckles against the wall. His mind was full of thoughts, most bad, as he ran through all the reasons why he was the only one Kirishima didn\u2019t want to speak to him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Ochako threw a pillow at him, snapping him out of his thoughts, \u201cCome on, sit down. We\u2019ll tell you what he said.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Turning around, Bakugou\u2019s curiosity got the better of him and he walked over to the couch.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">***</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Aoi stood at the doorway, shifting on her feet nervously. Isamu rubbed her shoulder reassuringly as Kirishima packed his car, boxes sat out on the sidewalk.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you sure you\u2019re ready?\u201d She asked, taking a small step forward.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kirishima turned around, smiling softly, \u201cYeah mom, I\u2019ll be alright.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He could still see the fear in his mom\u2019s eyes. He understood, when he had first woken up, he\u2019d been really difficult. He wouldn\u2019t eat, refused to allow doctors to touch him, and often ripped and destroyed his IVs. Anger was all he had felt in those few weeks, but after a while, the fight had left him. His mom had pleaded with him to stop, and he felt too guilty to continue.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Due to UA\u2019s threat of expulsion if he did otherwise, he\u2019d stayed in a psychiatric hospital, transferring over after his brain had been fully healed.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Honestly, it had helped. It wasn\u2019t fun, and he was still miserable, but the disconnection from the people he thought he was hurting stopped most of the worst thoughts.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He sat in therapy circles, took meds out of plastic cups, and was annoyed until he finally ate. Things got better. They never were fixed, he didn\u2019t leave the hospital feeling new or great, just better. A bit more whole.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He\u2019d returned home after three weeks, spending the next few catching up on homework, phone locked away by his own volition. When he had finished, still under observation from the hospital, he had asked for his phone back.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kirishima had called every person he could immediately, even his old friends. Everyone had been so kind, all of them saying they were excited to see him back. For a moment, he had forgotten why he hadn\u2019t thought that they were friends in the first place.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>But when he\u2019d picked up the phone to call Bakugou, everything had gone downhill. His mom had told him about how he\u2019d stayed with him, even on the worst night. She didn\u2019t know why he left, and Kirishima couldn\u2019t remember, but he assumed it had to do with his state when he first woke up. He could vaguely recall parts, though he was certain most of it was a dream. Soft kisses and fingers sometimes awoke him from his sleep.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He had seen the voicemails, and he\u2019d caved and listened to them too. Under the gruffiness of Bakugou\u2019s voice was a note of pain, and he never stopped, informing Kirishima of every detail he\u2019d missed</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He\u2019d yell, he\u2019d get angry and scream through the speakers, and Kirishima would listen. Other times he\u2019d cry and beg him to come back, to come <em>home</em>. Kirishima could hear small pops and the static as Bakugou, who he swore he could see huddled against the wall on his bedroom floor, sobbed into the mic.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Sometimes though, he would sound calm, retelling him stories of the day as he audibly fiddled with his hoodie strings. Something about those hurt most, the quiet acceptance of Kirishima\u2019s absence.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kirishima had replayed them a hundred times, trying to build up the courage to return the calls, but it didn\u2019t seem right. He was sick of telephone tag.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He wanted to see him in person.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>A small droplet hit his face as he hugged his mom tight, moving onto his dad when he was done, earring him a squeeze. Isamu helped him pack up the rest of his boxes, fitting them snugly in his passenger seat.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Hugging his parents a final time, he dusted his hands off and hopped into the driver\u2019s side.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">***</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bakugou laid on the couch, arms outstretched as he stared at the basket. He hadn\u2019t moved since Deku and Ochako had stopped by and left subsequently after a long discussion. He\u2019d been short with them, cutting them off constantly and refusing to listen.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Listening hurt, reminding him of his longing to talk to his friend who didn\u2019t want to talk to him. It felt shitty because they knew everything, and he knew nothing.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He wanted so desperately for his phone to buzz, for the screen to light up so he could read his name and hit the green call button. He\u2019d keep checking, maybe forever, for a call back.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Some anime played in the background as Bakugou closed his eyes, the sound of the rain pulling him closer to sleep.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>There was a knock at the door.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Sighing hard, Bakugou stood up, grumbling as he yelled out, \u201cDamnit Deku, I told you not to come back!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Ripping open the door, he stumbled when he caught sight of who was in front of them.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kirishima was staring at him, smiling sheepishly, \u201cUh... hey man!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bakugou was frozen in place, the wood of the door burning under his hand.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kirishima glanced at it nervously. Suddenly, he bowed deeply, \u201cI\u2019m so sorry! I didn\u2019t mean to ignore you!\u201d He let out a breath, still facing downwards, \u201cAfter I recovered, UA insisted I be sent to a mental hospital or I couldn\u2019t continue my schooling. They didn\u2019t allow phones there.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI promise I\u2019ve listened to every voicemail a hundred times!\u201d He said, finally looking upward, \u201cI wanted to call you back, but it felt wrong. We needed to talk face to face. I needed to apologize to you in person.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI brought you a gift basket of stuff that\u2019s in my car. It\u2019s got glow-in-the-dark stars and those hot tamales you like! I had your mom send me a picture of your old cat and I had a plushie made of it. Hopefully, that\u2019s not too weird. I also have a small project for us to-.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>His body moved on his own, surging forward to grab Kirishima by his shoulders as he kissed him hard.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kirishima caught him, wrapping his arms around his frame as their lips met.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It wasn\u2019t frantic or desperate as he thought it would be.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It was slow.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bakugou trailed his hands up Kirishima\u2019s shoulders as he breathed him in, that ribbon pulling them as close together as they could be. He took his time, imprinting the memory of Kirishima right on his fingertips. His waist was held tight, Kirishima leaning him backward some as he smiled into the kiss.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He tasted like strawberry protein powder.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Pulling away for a moment, Bakugou kissed him underneath his jaw, hand clutching his shirt. Shoving himself into the crook of Kirishima\u2019s neck, he could smell sage and rain and a hint of the black ice from his car.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It was incredibly Eijirou.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He let the water hit his skin, dying down the heat as he pushed further. Kirishima pressed a kiss to his hair, blinking the rain off his eyelashes.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re getting wet,\u201d He tried, pulling back to look at the blonde.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bakugou glanced up, unable to tell if the water on his face was tears or rain, \u201cI thought you\u2019d never want to talk to me again.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Kirishima asked, grabbing him by the shoulders, \u201cNo! That would never happen.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI left you there at the hospital,\u201d Bakugou sniffled, the wind picking up some.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cBakugou, the rain-.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou should hate me. Why don\u2019t you hate me?\u201d Bakugou asked, closing his eyes. Kirishima looked around, realizing his phone was still in his pocket and was about to be soaked. He latched onto Bakugou's wrist, pulling him back to the car.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Opening the back door, he pushed Bakugou inside, not caring when his clothes dampened the towels that were laid down. He climbed in beside him, shutting the door as the wind howled outside.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>They both sat there, panting as they tried to wrap their head around the emotions.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Bakugou said finally. \u201cI should\u2019ve been there.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou were,\u201d Kirishima answered, grabbing a blanket out of the top box. He wrapped it around Bakugou\u2019s shoulders, pulling it over his head to dry him off. He ran his hands back and forth over blonde hair, Bakugou scrunching his face up at the motion.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kirishima smiled as he slowed his movement, wiping some of the water off Bakugou\u2019s face, \u201cMom told me you were there. She also told me how you stayed that night, and how I was difficult when I woke up.\u201d He pulled his soaked jacket off, pulling the top box into the driver\u2019s seat so he could rummage through it.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He pulled out two hoodies and a pair of sweats., \u201cShe said it was hard for you, but you stayed with me when I was asleep.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201dIt doesn\u2019t matter anyway. Honestly, I don\u2019t know if I would\u2019ve let you back into my room after I woke up.\u201d He pulled Bakugou's wet shirt off like it was nothing, quickly replacing it with his old Crimson Riot hoodie.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He did the same to himself, relishing in the feeling of soft cotton against his skin. Bakugou stared at him like he was insane, \u201cI was angry I had failed, and I probably would\u2019ve taken it out on you.\u201d He offered the sweatpants, \u201cYou can wear them. I won\u2019t look either!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bakugou snaked their pinkies together, bundled up with a fresh hoodie and the blanket over his knees, \u201cS\u2019 fine.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cBakugou.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI said it\u2019s fine,\u201d Bakugou insisted, leaning down to place his head on Kirishima\u2019s shoulder.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kirishima shifted some, grabbing Bakugou's hand fully as they sat in the noise of the rain.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWas Fruits Basket really your favorite anime?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bakugou groaned, looking up towards the ceiling of the car, \u201cStop.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou had a cat! You had a cat you named after the main character of fucking <em>Fruits Basket</em>,\u201d Kirishima said, giggling slightly.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bakugou dropped down, resting his head against Kirishima\u2019s thighs, using the blanket to protect from the water, \u201cYes, I did.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYour favorite flavor of candy is cherry but you don\u2019t like actual cherries,\u201d Kirishima stated, running his fingers through Bakugou\u2019s hair.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI said that,\u201d Bakugou responded curtly, ignoring how good the massage felt.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kirishima continued his motions, \u201cyou sang the Pok\u00e9mon theme song for your talent show in second grade.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay, that\u2019s enough idiot,\u201d Bakugou growled, knocking a hand against his chest.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNo way! You said I could make fun of you as much as I wanted!\u201d Kirishima laughed, bending down slightly as his fingers connected to Bakugou\u2019s temple.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He turned away frowning, \u201cWhatever.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kirishima kept staring, brushing the hair from his face, \u201cYou keep souvenirs from your hikes and you run while listening to girl pop bands and you hate the feeling of velvet and\u2026 you love me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bakugou paused, eyes meeting Kirishima\u2019s as his face softened, \u201cI do.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>His face dropped some as he glanced off to the side, \u201cIt\u2019s gonna suck, you know that right?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat is?\u201d Bakugou asked, propping himself up some.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cLoving me,\u201d Kirishima responded, \u201cI\u2019m not\u2026 fixed. I\u2019ll still slip up and make a thousand mistakes.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bakugou scoffed, rolling his eyes, \u201cDo you know who you\u2019re talking to?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Chuckling, Kirishima wiped at his face, \u201cYeah, yeah. You\u2019re not as bad as you think.\u201d He sighed, \u201cI\u2019m just saying that I can be a burden at times. I might drag you down.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bakugou grabbed Kirishima\u2019s hand, pulling it away from his face, \u201cSure, sometimes you are a lot, and sometimes I have a hard time keeping up.\u201d He leaned up fully, inches away from Kirishima\u2019s face, \u201cbut what kinda hero would I be if I couldn\u2019t carry that weight when you need me too.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s heavier than you think,\u201d Kirishima rasped, trying not to meet his eyes.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t mind,\u201d Bakugou kissed him softly for no less than a second, grabbing his wrist as he pulled away. \u201cYou\u2019re worth the burden.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kirishima crumbled under Bakugou\u2019s touch, the little pieces of him pulling apart and reconnecting as he was peppered with light kisses. He grasped at the old hoodie as Bakugou put him back together with light fingers and lighter lips, rain thumping against the windows.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>As the night faded along with the downpour, the two made their way back into the house, Kirishima followed by curses about wet clothes and wetter floors.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you sure about this?\u201d Bakugou asked, looking at Kirishima in the mirror.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He thought about it really hard, staring at his reflection as Bakugou trailed his hands over his shoulders. Fiddling with his fingers, he shifted in his seat.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, I think I am,\u201d Kirishima said, looking up at him and smiling. Bakugou nodded, still seeming completely unsure.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He picked up some things from the counter, eyes glued on the bowl, \u201cI have no fucking idea what to do.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kirishima laughed, grabbed the stuff from his hands and he scooted his chair closer to the sink.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, I didn\u2019t think you would. That\u2019s alright,\u201d Kirishima said, mixing everything he needed as Bakugou watched.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kirishima stuck his tongue out, the little bit resting between his lips catching Bakugou\u2019s eye. Scoffing, he poked it, causing Kirishima to retract backward, \u201cHeh, you look like a dog.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Scowling, Kirishima punched his thigh, causing Bakugou to jump up onto one leg, \u201cOi! What the fuck asshole!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cStop making fun of me!\u201d Kirishima replied, going back to mixing what was in the bowl.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>After a while, he handed it back to him along with the brush, \u201cYou sure you can handle this Katsuki?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He growled, \u201cFuck off. You looking down on me?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNot at all!\u201d Kirishima assured, turning back around in his seat.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Holding up the brush, now covered with bleach, to his boyfriend\u2019s head, Bakugou stopped, \u201cUh\u2026 roots first.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNope!\u201d Kirishima replied, moving his head away first. \u201cRoots last.\u201d He grabbed a ponytail off the counter and tied his hair up, leaving the bottom section out, \u201cThere! Start with that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cUh, okay,\u201d Bakugou said nervously, holding a piece of hair with his gloved hand as he ran the brush over it.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kirishima stared back at his blonde hair, washed out with water and dried enough to take the dye, \u201cKatsuki! You did so well!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course I did idiot,\u201d Bakugou mumbled, turning his feverish face away. He pulled off his gloves, ready to put on a new set for the red. Kirishima grabbed his hand as he turned away, dragging him towards him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He stared at him for a moment before kissing his hand soft, feather-light, \u201cThank you so much for helping me Katsuki. I-.\u201d He closed his watery eyes, \u201cI didn\u2019t want to do it by myself.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Leaning down, Bakugou kissed his forehead, hands still intertwined, \u201cYeah, yeah, whatever you say, idiot. Of course I\u2019d help.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Smiling, Kirishima leaned into his lips, chasing them after he pulled away.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bakugou finally untangled their fingers, reaching for a new pair of gloves and the red dye.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kirishima looked at himself in the mirror, eyes set on the blonde. He touched it gently, fingers running through his hair as he took it in.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat are you thinking about?\u201d Bakugou asked, retaking his place behind him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kirishima\u2019s face was oddly helpless, \u201cWe look kinda similar, yeah?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Sighing with a small laugh, Bakugou rolled his eyes, \u201cYeah, a little.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI never noticed it before,\u201d Kirishima said, tapping his fingers against his scalp. \u201cI can\u2019t believe I\u2019m going to miss the blonde.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Glancing between their reflections, Bakugou could see the bittersweet expression he wore. With a huff, he scooped a bit of the red dye out and grabbed a piece of his hair that was resting against his scalp.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u2018What are you-?\u201d Kirishima started, watching as Bakugou lathered the strip with red, face twisted in complete concentration.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cTie one of your weird fucking horn pieces up,\u201d Bakugou muttered, still focused on his task. Kirishima did, separating away a piece that was similar to Bakugou\u2019s as he watched him ruin his perfect blonde hair.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThere,\u201d he said, turning to his boyfriend with a wicked smirk, \u201cnow we\u2019ll match. Blonde and red.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Blinking slowly, Kirishima sat back in his seat, Bakugou diving right into painting his hair with dye. He listened to the drag of the brush, felt the bristles touch his skin as Kirishima simply let Bakugou fix his mistake.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>After a few minutes, Kirishima whispered, \u201cYou want to match with me?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDuh,\u201d Bakugou said, acting as though it was a fact Kirishima should\u2019ve known before birth.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>With a small grin, Kirishima relaxed into his touch.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDone!\u201d Bakugou said, taking the towel off his head. Kirishima stood up to look into the mirror, eyes on the firetruck hair that was his hair.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>His soul swelled inside of him, filling up his chest cavity and making him unable to breathe. For the first time in so long, he didn\u2019t look like that kid from middle school. His eyes were still tired, still looking for the next mishap, but he was absent of the drowning darkness.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tears spilled out of his overfilled eyes as he looked back at Bakugou, who seemed shell-shocked, \u201cDid I fuck it up? I can do it again!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kirishima wrapped him up in a crushing hug, picking him up off his feet as he wheezed. Bakugou grasped him back, sighing in relief, \u201cIt\u2019s good?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, it\u2019s perfect,\u201d Kirishima wept, face buried in Bakugou\u2019s chest.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>They stayed like that for a bit, Bakugou dangled in the air as Kirishima cried softly.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you ready to go back?\u201d Bakugou asked, touching his new hair.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kirishima nodded, unable to produce much more than sounds. He put Bakugou\u2019s feet back on the floor, still wrapped up in his embrace.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bakugou pulled the seat around and sat them both down, Kirishima in his lap.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou look good,\u201d Bakugou mumbled, rubbing his back as soothing as he could.</p>\n<p><br>Kirishima laughed lightly, hands clutching his black hoodie, \u201cThanks.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bakugou nodded, kissing his temple. Kirishima pulled back, wiping at his face, \u201cI\u2026 I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Shaking his head, Bakugou leaned forward, \u201cI already told you I don\u2019t care if you cry.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNot about that, I just-,\u201d Kirishima swallowed hard, fingers trailing up his wrist, \u201cI\u2019m sorry about the silence.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou already apologized, idiot,\u201d Bakugou grumbled, turning his face to the side.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wrapping their hands together, Kirishima ran his thumb over Bakugou\u2019s fingers, \u201cBut I feel like you\u2019re still blaming yourself. When I woke up, I was <em>so </em>angry that I didn\u2019t want to speak with my own parents. I don\u2019t blame you for not coming back, because even if you had, I wouldn\u2019t have spoken to you. It was\u2026 embarrassing being alive.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bakugou sniffled, gaze still glued on the wall as Kirishima continued, \u201cThen, I was in the mental hospital for weeks and I didn\u2019t have my phone and I-.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou can stop apologizing,\u201d Bakugou rasped, pulling him closer. \u201cCan we just admit that we\u2019re both gonna feel like shit and move on.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Huffing, Kirishima closed his eyes, \u201cBut I don\u2019t want you to feel that way.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cRemember when you told me words couldn\u2019t fix you?\u201d Bakugou said, \u201cI\u2019m always going to feel like I could\u2019ve done more. I\u2019m always going to feel like I should\u2019ve <em>tried </em>harder or went to the hospital again and again until you let me in. I feel like I wasn\u2019t good enough, and that\u2019s not going to go away.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kirishima brushed Bakugou\u2019s newly red streak, \u201cI wish I could make you realize that\u2019s not true.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bakugou grabbed his wrist, staring at him with a hardened gaze, \u201cand I wish I could make you realize that you\u2019re worth more than not feeling the bad shit.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Taken aback, Kirishima grimaced, dropping his head, \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever feel that way.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThen I guess you\u2019re stuck with me until you do,\u201d Bakugou mumbled, connecting their lips.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>They sunk into each other, connected at the hands as he kissed him slowly.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kirishima pulled away for a moment, \u201cand if I do realize, are you gonna stick with me after?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Grinning, Bakugou squeezed their fingers, \u201cDuh, dummy.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Nervously, Kirishima tapped his feet against the tile, \u201cDo you think they\u2019ll be mad?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, and if they are I\u2019ll beat them into a pulp,\u201d Bakugou growled, holding his hand tight.<br><br>Kirishima nodded, putting a finger in his collar to let out the hot air. Grabbing his tie, Bakugou loosened it, a breath escaping Kirishima, \u201cYou\u2019re going to choke yourself.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He laughed tensely as Bakugou ran fingers through his hair, pulling on the little blonde piece.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou can go back to the dorms,\u201d He supplied.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Groaning, Kirishima shook his head like a wet dog, \u201cNo, I have to go in.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>His stomach was churning, making him nauseous. He really felt like he needed to puke, but swallowed it down as he gripped Bakugou\u2019s hand tighter.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay, I\u2019m ready,\u201d Kirishima said, stepping forward even though he was very much not ready.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He pushed open the door, finally able to hear Aizawa's voice. He was speaking on some type of fighting strategy, the words garbled from the nerves.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Stepping fully in the room, he was surrounded by silence.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Everyone was staring at him, looking so deep into his soul that he felt the need to hide, glancing around for spots to disappear into.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>With a sigh, Aizawa set down his mug and studied him before gesturing with his hand, \u201cWelcome back Kirishima.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The class moved in sync, everyone scrambling out of their seats and surrounding Kirishima in a moment. He felt extremely overwhelmed.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOh my god, you\u2019re back!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re so glad you\u2019re okay!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you still hurt? Are you back full time?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bakugou stepped in front of them, growling frighteningly similar to a rabid dog, \u201cBack the fuck off. You\u2019re making him uncomfortable.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Everyone seemed to take a big step away at once, Ochako and Deku remaining in the circle.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m happy you\u2019re back,\u201d Midoriya said gently, resting a hand on his shoulder.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Grabbing his arm, Ochako gazed up at him with watery eyes, \u201cYou look so good!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>With trembling lips, Kirishima smiled, \u201cThank you, guys.\u201d He turned his attention to the class, \u201cI\u2019m glad to be back.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>As the comments and questions continued, he caught sight of Sero and Denki. They seemed tired, the bags under their eyes a mix of dark colors as they kept their lips sealed. Kaminari put his hand up and waved a little, trying his best to smile.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kirishima waved back, chest tightening at the gesture.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>His gaze was torn from them by a pink hand extending outwards. In it was a journal, black and small; it was almost mistakable for his old one.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cTake it,\u201d Mina said, thrusting it out again.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kirishima took it slowly, the distraction giving him only a moment of reprieve before the mummers started up again, turning into chatter, and back into yelling.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He smiled, the familiarity of his surroundings settling deep into his bones as Bakugou intertwined their fingers. Soft hair brushed against his shoulder.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The class exploded.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kirishima sat in his little nook, hands on the book he\u2019d been given. He had yet to open it, a bit afraid of what he might see inside.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It was actually the same brand as his old journal, which he was sure had been trashed ages ago. The spine was worn, the cover torn in spots. It was obviously well used, which confused Kirishima even more.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He opened it, eyes searching the first page.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Examining closer, he could see that it was signed by all of his classmates and some outside of it, like Tetsutetsu and Shinsou. As he flipped through the pages, he saw the bunch of scattered paragraphs.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>One for each of the people that had signed the inside of the cover.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Most of them took up two pages, some more or a little less, but they were all kind. Filled with compliments and stories, Kirishima scanned each note carefully, soaking in every detail. He trailed his finger over some of the words, tearing up a bit as he stared at the ink. They were all so <em>kind</em>, expressing how much they missed him and hoped he would be okay.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kirishima wondered what would\u2019ve happened to his class if he hadn\u2019t returned.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wrapped up in the book, he didn\u2019t notice a pair approaching him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Sero waited patiently for his acknowledgment as Kaminari\u2019s foot tapped the ground. Torn from his reading by the noise, Kirishima looked up.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The room surged with tension as the three exchanged a stare.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Then, both boys bowed deep.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re so sorry Kirishima!\u201d Sero said, facing downwards.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kaminari nodded, pulling up his hand to wipe at his face.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Stuttering, Kirishima tripped over his words, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to do that. H-Hey, get up.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>They both rose, Kirishima able to see the tears Sero was trying to hold back, and the ones Denki couldn\u2019t.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kirishima put his hands up, trying to make the gesture reassuring, \u201cIt\u2019s not your fault!\u201d<br><br></p>\n<p>\u201cBut it is,\u201d Kaminari replied, taking a step closer, \u201cWe abandoned you this summer, made you feel alone. That was shitty of us. We were trying not to take sides but we kinda did anyway.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Sero agreed, \u201cWe feel awful. Is there anything we can do to make you forgive us?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Glancing between the both of them, Kirishima paused. He was hesitant to let them back in so soon after the pain these last months had caused. Looking at them now though, they seemed so sad, faces pale and eyes sunken in just a bit.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>In a moment of weakness, Kirishima spoke, \u201cI can\u2019t. Not yet.\u201d It was harsh, and it felt bad, but it was the truth, \u201cThis summer hurt a lot and I need more time to sort things out.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The boys deflated, Kaminari turning away to cover his face as Sero nodded slowly. Kirishima\u2019s leg shook fiercely as the guilt ate at him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, we didn\u2019t think you would,\u201d Sero said, a sad smile on his face.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kaminari sucked in a breath through the tears, \u201cThat\u2019s alright man, we understand.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kirishima wanted to reach out so badly, but he needed <em>time </em>to reconnect with them before he threw himself into that situation. He barely trusted himself around Bakugou; he still felt like he was stumbling with every step. To rush back into being friends with them, he knew it\u2019d be a mistake.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, um,\u201d Kaminari sniffled, pulling his hoodie sleeve over his hand, \u201cWe\u2019ll see you around.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>As they turned to walk away, Kirishima stood up, body moving mostly on its own, \u201cMe and Bakugou are having a movie night with Deku and Ochako tomorrow.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The pair looked over their shoulder before glancing at each other.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou should come,\u201d Kirishima said, extending the olive branch as far out as he could, hoping they would take it.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Kaminari whispered, voice hoarse, \u201cWe\u2019ll be there.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>They took their leave, Kirishima left behind with a black notebook.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He knew there would be gifts waiting for him upon his return, it had happened with his parents too. Deep down, he believed that most people thought they could fix pain with a present. They weren\u2019t wrong per se, though the fix was more like putting a staple in a stab wound than a bandaid over a papercut.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He hadn\u2019t expected, however, the number of gifts that would be waiting for him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Here he stood, in front of his door, unable to get through due to the mountain of gifts. Aizawa had actually told him he had <em>more </em>to bring up, which seemed impossible because everything under the sun seemed to be sitting on his doorstep.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>As he looked at the mound of gifts, he heard footsteps coming up the stairs.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>When he looked over, he was met with pink.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cKirishima,\u201d Mina said, walking over to him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He froze, unable to think of an answer. However, she seemed unfazed, \u201cThe silent treatment? Ah, should\u2019ve guessed.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d He finally said, shifting his gaze back to the presents.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>She didn\u2019t say anything for a moment, tapping her finger against her thigh, \u201cI\u2019ve been an asshole. You have every right to be angry with me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIf you\u2019re going to say what I think you\u2019re going to say, don\u2019t,\u201d Kirishima said, scoffing.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m <em> saying </em> I\u2019m sorry,\u201d Mina said, sighing, \u201cand I\u2019m telling you not to forgive me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kirishima tilted his head, \u201cThen why apologize?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cBecause I feel bad, I genuinely do. What I did was fucked up and wrong and I\u2019m a bad person for doing it,\u201d she answered, looking over the mound of gifts. \u201cI did it because being around you felt shitty, still feels shitty - even if it\u2019s for a different reason.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>She kicked at the ground, \u201cand now, because of what I did, being around me makes you feel shitty, right?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He didn\u2019t want to reply, but the silence seemed to say enough.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, I know,\u201d she turned to him, expression still unreadable. \u201cYou hurt me on accident, so I hurt you on purpose because I thought it was fair. That pain isn\u2019t going to go away for a long time, maybe ever. You deserve the space to heal Kirishima. After everything I\u2019ve taken, maybe I can give you that back.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He stared at her in awe; the exchange was awfully mature for a teenage girl whose life experience boiled down to learning to cheat death.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Or maybe it was perfectly mature enough.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kirishima didn\u2019t know.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>She picked up a box of Ochako\u2019s candies, ripping open the bag to hand him one.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It was the cinnamon kind he knew <em>she knew </em>he didn\u2019t like, \u201cIf there\u2019s anyone you should forgive, it\u2019s the boys. They were torn up about it from the start.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He nodded, half-listening and half-processing as she took a step back.</p>\n<p><br><br>\u201cI\u2019ll see you around,\u201d Mina said, walking off towards the stairs with a wave.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kirishima watched her before the same wave of adrenaline surged over him, \u201cMina!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>She looked back, wary.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kirishima grinned wide, \u201cI hate you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Taking a moment to process what she heard, Mina blinked.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Then she smiled too.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah. I hate you too, Red.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>She left, taking his candy with her down the stairs.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kirishima could feel the tears fall over his cheeks, colder than usual. He felt like he was grieving, the tightness in his tongue feeding the pit in his stomach as it swallowed up all the memories of the past, spitting them back into his face as he cried.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It felt relieving to be torn from her, and yet it still hurt in this all-consuming way. Pieces of him that had rotted away were being torn apart, and it was for the best, but <em> fuck </em> if it wasn\u2019t painful.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He felt a hand on his shoulder, jumping at the sudden sensation.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He turned, Bakugou\u2019s hands catching his face. Trying his best to blink away the tears, he could hear Bakugou\u2019s concern, \u201cWhat happened? Eijirou, c\u2019mon.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cMina,\u201d he managed to rasp, clasping onto Bakugou\u2019s wrist.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>His face soured, looking over Kirishima's shoulder, \u201cShe said some awful shit, didn\u2019t she? I swear of my life if she did something mean I\u2019ll-.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kirishima shook his head, laughing through the sobs, \u201cActually, I think she did something really nice.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Cocking his head in confusion, Bakugou sputtered, \u201cThen why are you crying?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kirishima wrapped his hands around Bakugou\u2019s waist, pulling him in close as he rested his head on his shoulder, \u201cIt <em> hurts </em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bakugou quickly returned the hug, his hands rubbing circles in his back that reminded Kirishima of a little spell; it was like he was trying to rid his body of the demons that plagued it. Falling into the rhythm of Bakugou\u2019s movement, he feared he might fall asleep standing up.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI wanna sleep,\u201d Kirishima mumbled, dragging himself away from the warm body, little specks of Bakugou body stuck to him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cGo ahead,\u201d Bakugou said, gesturing to the door, \u201cI\u2019ll bring the gifts in and I\u2019ll lay with you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>So, Kirishima cuddled up in his bed, listening to Bakugou huff and pant as he made several trips back and forth.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Once the dragging and placing had ceased, Kirishima felt the bed dip, hands touching his shoulder.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He shifted, spinning to grab Bakugou\u2019s hand, dragging him down next to him. He laid his head down on his arm, Kirishima\u2019s hand running up his back and resting against his absent wings, shoulder blades dull and welcoming. His forehead touched Kirishima\u2019s chest, listening intently to the heartbeat thump like a snare drum.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI missed your hair,\u201d Bakugou admitted, speaking the words into the dark room with a glowing ceiling.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kirishima snorted, \u201cDoes it remind you of the old me?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d He responded, tilting his head up to barely brush Kirishima\u2019s lips with his. \u201cIt reminds me of Eijirou. Every Eijirou.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bakugou kissed him, Kirishima breathing him in like a party drug he couldn\u2019t get enough of. Hands tangled themselves in his hair as they flipped positions.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kirishima noticed Bakugou tasted vaguely of strawberry protein powder.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He hadn\u2019t tasted like that before.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>With the stars hung above them, Bakugou used his calloused hands to pull Kirishima apart, setting the foundation for a new story to be told on Kirishima\u2019s scarred skin.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>And it felt right.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It felt like <em>living</em>.</p>"
