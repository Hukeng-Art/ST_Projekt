  "notes": "<p class=\"jump\">(See the end of the work for <a href=\"#work_endnotes\">notes</a>.)</p>\n<p>So just to clear up a few things before you guys read the chapter:</p>\n<p>- This does not directly follow the last chapter. That being said, it does not negate the ending of the previous chapter, of Lance's self-doubts (that is mainly something that will grow with this fic, and will be touched upon in a later chapter more specifically).</p>\n<p>- I'm getting carried away with plots, lol! I know the fic is focused mostly on Lance crying, but I felt that doing 5 scenarios of Lance randomly crying would not be as entertaining as perhaps making it part of his struggle in the overall chapter. I hope this is something you like?</p>\n<p>- Implied Galra Keith, but the team (including Keith) have no knowledge of it... Only Haggar does.</p>\n<p>\n(See the end of the chapter for <a href=\"#chapter_2_endnotes\">more notes</a>.)\n</p>\n<p>I had so many ideas that grew with writing this chapter, and I feel like it's something that I could definitely move to a whole fic of its own later on if you guys like it enough. So if you do, please leave a comment or message me on tumblr @daminwayne letting me know if you would be interested to see the after effects of Haggar's revelations with Galra Keith and the doubts Lance will face!!</p>\n<p>I hope you enjoyed xx</p>\n<p>Prepare the blankets and the hot chocolate!!</p>\n<p>A bit of a longer chapter for you guys today :p one of my personal favourites so far!</p>\n<p>\n(See the end of the chapter for <a href=\"#chapter_4_endnotes\">more notes</a>.)\n</p>\n<p>Ahhh what did you think?</p>\n<p>Yay last chapter!!! Lance finally crying ; u ; but not without more pain oops.</p>\n<p>Please note, this goes on a weird deviation to the season 1 finale. I wanted it to have the similar conflict, but keep it tied up with my previous chapter.. and so you got this interesting situation.</p>\n<p>Enjoy!</p>\n<p>please let me know what you think!<br>all comments/kudos/subscriptions are greatly appreciated!! </p>\n<p>+ You can find me on tumblr @ daminwayne! :)</p>",
  "text": "<p>\u201cDamn it, Lance,\u201d Keith curses, running a hand through his hair. \u201cThis is serious, alright? Shiro is on the bench for this mission, that doesn\u2019t mean you get to goof around and mess this all up.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lance pushes down his irritation, but can\u2019t help but bite back with, \u201calso doesn\u2019t mean you need to pretend to be Shiro.\u201d</p>\n<p>This mission is taking a bigger toll on them than they would like to admit. Shiro had been injured in the previous mission, and had only been out of his healing pod for twenty minutes before another distress call sounded nearby. They had assured Shiro they could handle it without him, but now\u2026</p>\n<p>Lance shakes his head. No, they can handle it. They <em>will</em> handle it. He\u2019s totally not freaking out. Not panicking. He\u2019s calm and collected, and he knows what he\u2019s doing. <em>Lance</em> panicking? Pssh. Yeah, right. As if.</p>\n<p>\u201cMaybe we can attack it from below, you know? Like, like maybe we can distract it by going around and around and around in circles until it gets like, dizzy? And then we attack it before it has a chance to stand still and\u2013\u2013and you know, regain its senses, I don\u2019t know, maybe, maybe Blue can ice it again, or maybe,\u201d He\u2019s definitely <em>not </em>rambling because he\u2019s panicking, nope. \u201cMaybe we can like, trick it into\u2013\u2013\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLance, for God\u2019s sake!\u201d Pidge shouts, distraught. \u201cWe need to focus, okay?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay!\u201d Lance exclaims, exasperated. \u201cOkay! But if you haven\u2019t noticed, we can\u2019t exactly form Voltron right now! I mean if we could, then I could have used my bayard and we could have used it to shoot the heck out of this monster but\u2013\u2013but Shiro\u2019s not here, and we can\u2019t form Voltron, and I\u2019m trying to think of ideas!\u201d</p>\n<p>If the other paladins notice his voice growing shaky and loud towards the end, they don\u2019t comment on it. Instead, Keith brings Red to a halt and grounds out, \u201cWe\u2019re all aware of that, Lance, but if you don\u2019t have anything useful to contribute, then keep it shut.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lance\u2019s jaw clenches, and he exhales heavily through his nose.</p>\n<p>Then it occurs to him: the monster\u2019s only using its right arm for attack, and its left arm for defence. If they can disable its defence system, then it would be vulnerable for attack on its left side, which would give them time to also distract it before it could fire again\u2026</p>\n<p>\u201cHey, guys, I think I got an idea,\u201d he says.</p>\n<p>He thinks he can hear Keith mutter something under his breath.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, seriously,\u201d Lance pushes on, shaking his head. \u201cLook, it\u2019s only using its left side for defence, and it\u2019s right arm for attack, so if Hunk and I try to disable its\u2013\u2013\u201d</p>\n<p>But no, apparently the team has other ideas. Okay, that\u2019s totally cool. Lance is not going to comment on how Keith, Pidge and Hunk all decided to attack the robot\u2019s head (which they\u2019ve <em>already tried</em>, but look how that went), leaving Lance behind, unsure of where to aim.</p>\n<p>So Lance decides to aim for left arm. Maybe that will make it more vulnerable to attacks from the other paladins, and it may distract it from them momentarily.</p>\n<p>But as he is Lance, and as the universe is never on his side, his plan for \u201cdistraction\u201d ends up with his lion spiralling straight down to the ground after a turbo blast aimed right for it.</p>\n<p>\u201cLance!\u201d Hunk calls out in concern. \u201cYou okay?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Lance tries to reassure them, gulping nervously. He takes a look back up at the robot now towering above him, and notices that his attack, at least, had worked. Its left side is completely open. \u201cIts left side is vulnerable, you guys should\u2013\u2013ah, shit!\u201d</p>\n<p>Blue crashes into the ground, hard, and Lance is thrown out of his seat. His shoulder collides with the wall, and he bites back against a scream as he feels a <em>pop</em>. He shuts his eyes, inhaling through his teeth, praying that that is <em>not</em> a dislocated shoulder.</p>\n<p>\u201cLance?\u201d It\u2019s Keith now, and Lance is surprised to hear the hint of concern lacing his voice. \u201cYou alright down there?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGreat,\u201d Lance mutters, pushing himself to stand up. Yep, that is definitely a dislocated shoulder. And it hurts.</p>\n<p>A lot.</p>\n<p>He walks back to the cockpit, but before he slides back into the seat, he hears the other paladins calling out for him in alarm. When he looks out the window\u2013\u2013technically, Blue\u2019s eye\u2013\u2013to see what\u2019s going on, he feels his heart drop.</p>\n<p>Another turbo blast, headed right towards Blue.</p>\n<p>Before Lance can react, the turbo blast hits them, and the lion rolls over across the harsh terrain, taking quite the beating when it begins to roll down a hill.</p>\n<p>Lance takes an even worse beating, however, when he is sent to the other side of the cockpit, crashing against the wall, and <em>ow</em>, his shoulder, that <em>hurts</em>. Then he falls forward when Blue rolls over again, then falls back, then he\u2019s thrown across the cockpit <em>again</em>\u2013\u2013</p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t know how long it goes on for, only that when Blue finally stills, he rolls over to his side and vomits. His head is thumping, and black is dancing around the edges of his vision. Sometime during the process, his helmet had fallen off his head, now lying across from him with a crack running down its centre.</p>\n<p>His shoulder is burning, his ankle is pulsing with pain, his head hurts and he wants to throw up again\u2026 Sitting up is not something he even wants to <em>think about</em>, but he can hear his teammates calling for him through the coms. He just has to reach his helmet. Simple.</p>\n<p><em>You can do it, Lance</em>, he tells himself, and rolls over onto his stomach before pushing forward and crawling over to his helmet.</p>\n<p>His entire body screams in protest, but finally, he reaches the helmet. \u201cGuys?\u201d He croaks.</p>\n<p>\u201cLance!\u201d It\u2019s Shiro. When did Shiro get on the coms? \u201cAre you alright?\u201d</p>\n<p>Lance remains quiet for a few moments, contemplating an answer. Is he alright? No, not really. His lip begins to tremble as the pain washes over him, and he shuts his eyes. But he can\u2019t tell Shiro that, can\u2019t let him down\u2013\u2013It was the <em>one</em> mission they had without him leading, and wasn\u2019t it enough that Lance had gotten himself into this mess? \u201cI\u2019m good,\u201d he lies in a small voice.</p>\n<p>Shiro pauses, skeptical of the boy\u2019s answer, but lets it slide. \u201cOkay. We\u2019re heading your way now, with the castle. Can you fly Blue?\u201d</p>\n<p>Shit. Can he? Lance closes his eyes, searching for the bond with Blue, searching for his lion\u2019s thoughts. Can she fly?</p>\n<p><em>Yes</em>, he feels her say, albeit tiredly. He\u2019s never felt her this tired before.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d he echoes to Shiro. Then, after a deep inhale, he pushes himself up to his knees, shutting his eyes when all he can see is black. <em>Inhale, exhale</em>. Slowly. Regain your footing. He opens his eyes again, then bites down on his lip when he grips the arm of the pilot chair and pushes himself to stand up.</p>\n<p>\u201cLet\u2019s do this, mi amore,\u201d he whispers to Blue, and the seat slides back closer to the control panel, which glows at his touch.</p>\n<p>The flight is wonky, at best, but Lance manages to reach the castle. What he expects when he finally makes it to the ramp is to be carried off to the healing pod, where he can actually relax and sleep for as long as he needs to.</p>\n<p>What he does not expect is for the entire team to be scowling at him, and certainly not for Keith to rush over to him only to jab a finger into his chest.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat the Hell, Lance?\u201d Keith is angry. Why is he angry? \u201cWhy don\u2019t you ever listen to us? We were all attacking its head, and you\u2013\u2013you decided to attack its arm! You didn\u2019t help us, and you left yourself open for attack!\u201d</p>\n<p>Lance flinches, his growing headache definitely not appreciating Keith shouting at such a close proximity. \u201cYou didn\u2019t even <em>say</em> what you were planning to do! I was telling you we should attack its defence, ah,\u201d his ankle throbs painfully again, \u201cand you guys were just off attacking the head again!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, we didn\u2019t say it, but we all agreed on it,\u201d Hunk chimes in, \u201cyou know, through the lions\u2019 bond. It was like we all had the same idea, and then it was like we all just decided to go for it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Pidge furrows her eyebrows. \u201cYou didn\u2019t feel that?\u201d</p>\n<p>Lance lets out a sharp breath, and looks down, shaking his head\u2026 which proves to be a bad idea when the world begins to tilt around him, and his nausea begins to creep up again. \u201cNo, I didn\u2019t, and apparently you guys didn\u2019t hear me trying to offer a better plan.\u201d He argues weakly.</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course you didn\u2019t feel it,\u201d Keith snaps, crossing his arms. \u201cYou weren\u2019t taking the mission seriously!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe paladins\u2026\u201d Allura hesitantly adds. \u201cThe paladins should all be able to feel this.\u201d</p>\n<p>Oh, okay. Lance gets it. Paladins should feel it, and he didn\u2019t, and it was his fault that the team decided to follow through with a dumb plan instead of listening to him, and it\u2019s his fault that he can barely stand on his feet and his shoulder is hurting and his head feels like it\u2019s about to burst open, yeah, okay. No, he gets it. \u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cLook, maybe you just need to work harder on your bonding,\u201d Pidge says. \u201cIn another mission\u2026 that could have cost someone their life. We need to all be able to communicate through our bond, Lance, and if you can\u2019t, then it might really hold us back.\u201d</p>\n<p>His lip begins to tremble again, and Lance wants to curse this habit, wants to curse the fact that he has no control over it. He closes his eyes, and as he lets out the next breath, he drops to his knees, unable to keep himself upright any longer.</p>\n<p>If his mom had been here, then she would have led him right inside, laid him down on his bed and made him some soup and gave him some painkillers\u2026 She would have hugged him tight and\u2026 and <em>then</em> she would have disciplined him\u2026</p>\n<p>But he\u2019s in space now, he\u2019s a defender of the universe.</p>\n<p>He lifts his eyes slowly, and when they meet with Shiro\u2019s, he drops his gaze immediately.</p>\n<p>He can\u2019t cry, not in front of his hero. Not in front of the team that already considers him to be their weakest. So he shuts his eyes, and tries to even out his breathing. He\u2019s not going to cry.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he whispers instead. But Keith does not look smug when his eyes meet Lance\u2019s; Instead, he looks very worried.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe should bring him inside,\u201d Shiro says, limping closer to Lance. \u201cYou don\u2019t look so great, kiddo.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI always look great,\u201d Lance fires back, attempting one of his big, toothy grins. It falls right off when Hunk touches his shoulder, however, and he hisses out in pain.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, jeez, I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d Hunk apologizes. \u201cHey, do you think you could put your arms across my neck? You don\u2019t look like you can walk very much, and I don\u2019t want to carry you if your shoulder is hurting\u2026 so maybe I can give you a piggy-back ride, just like our days back in the garrison?\u201d</p>\n<p>Lance nods, licking his dry lips, and wraps his good arm around Hunk\u2019s neck when his friend gets into position. Pidge and Keith help him wrap his legs around Hunk\u2019s waist, and Lance curls in on himself, shying away from their touch.</p>\n<p>He must look terrible if even <em>Keith</em> had stopped snapping at him.</p>\n<p>But as they make their way back to the castle, Lance cannot stop thinking about the fact that he could not feel the team\u2019s bond.</p>\n<p>Was he really not meant to be part of this team?</p>\n<p>Allura had assured them that this would be nothing but a simple mission: jump onto the planet, attack what appeared to be a small fleet of Galran robots, bring safety and peace to the civilization\u2026. the normal stuff. It was nothing new; Lance would have no problem shooting down a few Galran robots. He might even enjoy it!</p>\n<p>What Lance <em>does</em> have a problem with is the creepy Galran woman standing in front of him. She\u2019s dressed like a witch\u2013\u2013no, scratch that, she probably <em>is</em> a witch. A Galran witch. The same witch Shiro had mentioned?</p>\n<p>Oh. That\u2019s probably not good.</p>\n<p>\u201cShiro,\u201d Lance whispers into the coms, taking a cautious step back, his bayard gun trained on the witch. He receives no answer. \u201cGuys!\u201d</p>\n<p>After a few moments of the static cackling in his hears, Shiro\u2019s voice sounds again. \u201cLance?\u201d</p>\n<p>Lance breathes out a sigh of relief. \u201cThe weird Galran witch is here, and she\u2019s staring at me. Like, directly into my eyes, and this is very unnerving\u2026\u201d He takes another step back. \u201cUm, what do I do? I\u2019m kind of trapped. Do I kill her? I mean, that shouldn\u2019t bring me years of bad luck, right? Do I get cursed if I murder a witch?\u201d Oh no, he\u2019s rambling again. He gulps nervously. \u201cBut seriously, what do I do?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course you can\u2019t kill her!\u201d Shiro hisses, and Lance flinches in surprise. \u201cYou stay put where you are, Lance.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lance\u2019s back hits the wall behind him, then, and he begins to feel his panic rising. The witch seems to be approaching him without actually\u2026 walking. It\u2019s almost as though she\u2019s floating towards him. \u201cOkay\u2026 Hey, Shiro? I really don\u2019t know what to do.\u201d</p>\n<p><em>I\u2019m scared</em>.</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course you don\u2019t,\u201d chimes Pidge. \u201cWhen do you ever know what to do?\u201d</p>\n<p>Not helping, Pidge. Not helping.</p>\n<p>\u201cLook, Lance,\u201d Shiro says, and he sounds tired. Very tired. \u201cWe have a lot of things to cover over here\u2013\u2013can you stall for a while? Just keep her busy. We need to get those civilians to safety. Can you do that for me?\u201d</p>\n<p>Lance nods shakily to himself, gaze still locked with the witch\u2019s. \u201cOf course, Shiro.\u201d</p>\n<p>He can hear Keith snort, and he can\u2019t help but bite out with: \u201cThis isn\u2019t funny, Keith!\u201d</p>\n<p>Because for once, it\u2019s not.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s terrifying.</p>\n<p>Why is the witch staring at him? Why is she not attacking him, or speaking, or\u2026 you know, doing creepy witch stuff, like pulling out a wand or riding away on a broomstick?</p>\n<p>\u201cSure it is.\u201d Keith argues. \u201cIt\u2019s just funny that Shiro thinks you can handle that task.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lance shuts his eyes, forcing himself to take a deep breath. <em>Don\u2019t let him get to you</em>, he thinks. <em>Don\u2019t let him get to you. You can do this, you can prove to all of them that you can handle this.</em></p>\n<p>But why doesn\u2019t Shiro want the witch dead?</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ll be on our way soon,\u201d Shiro then reassures him. \u201cJust stay with her, okay? Keep her busy.\u201d</p>\n<p><em>Keep her busy, keep her busy. How am I supposed to do that! And why should I stay with her?</em> Lance wants to shout. But he doesn\u2019t, because that would be proving to Keith that he doesn\u2019t know how to handle the situation\u2013\u2013and he can! He totally can, and he will.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cUm, what do I do? I\u2019m kind of trapped. Do I kill her? I mean, that shouldn\u2019t bring me years of bad luck, right? Do I get cursed if I murder a witch?\u201d Lance asks nervously. \u201cBut seriously, what do I do?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, no,\u201d Shiro mutters. \u201cLance, you have to get out of there.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay\u2026 Hey, Shiro? I really don\u2019t know what to do.\u201d</p>\n<p>Shirt\u2019s heart clenches. Lance\u2019s voice is small, so small, and he sounds scared. Shiro had seen the witch, had been under her spell himself\u2026 He does not want Lance to suffer through it.</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Lance, we\u2019re almost done here.\u201d Pidge chimes, sliding under a robot and zapping it in the back with her weapon.</p>\n<p>\u201cLook, Lance,\u201d Shiro says, attempting to hide the tinge of fear in his voice. \u201cWe\u2019re on our way, yeah? Try to slip past her if you can. Fight her if you need to, but focus on escaping. We\u2019ll be there soon. Can you do that for me?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course, Shiro.\u201d Comes Lance\u2019s reply. He\u2019s clearly attempting to sound more confident than he probably feels\u2013\u2013and Shiro can respect that. Then: \u201cThis isn\u2019t funny, Keith!\u201d</p>\n<p>Keith, who is on an entirely different sector, furrows his eyebrows as he kicks off another alien. \u201cWhat? Lance, I didn\u2019t even <em>say</em> anything.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lance doesn\u2019t answer, but they can hear him inhale deeply.</p>\n<p>Shirt exchanges a worried glance with Hunk, who\u2019s fighting by his side, and promises: \u201cWe\u2019ll be on our way soon, Lance.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSo\u2026 You\u2019re a Galran witch?\u201d He pipes up, sounding a lot less confident than he would have liked.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d she answers, and Lance jumps in surprise. Her voice is\u2026 <em>inside</em> his mind, somehow. He shudders. \u201cMy name is Haggar.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHaggar,\u201d he muses, fingers tightening around the weapon in his hands. \u201cWhat a lovely name. You, uh, work for Zarkon?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI prefer to say I work with him,\u201d Haggar says, a corner of her lips moving up slowly. \u201cBut you cannot say that about your princess, can you? You work for her, like slaves. I suppose you will not understand my status with Zarkon.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHey, that\u2019s not\u2013\u2013that\u2019s not true!\u201d Lance argues. \u201cWe\u2019re a team. We\u2019re a great team, and we\u2019re going to bring you down, lady. You and Zarkon. You can\u2019t stand a chance against Voltron.\u201d His voice is a bit shaky, but he manages to build more strength into it.</p>\n<p>\u201cA team?\u201d She sounds amused. \u201cA team with a Galran hybrid as your leader, with a Galran child riding the red lion.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lance cocks his head to the side. \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d</p>\n<p>A Galran child riding the red lion?</p>\n<p><em>Keith</em>.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re messing with me,\u201d Lance decides, raising the gun again.</p>\n<p>\u201cI have no reason to \u2018mess with you\u2019, Blue Paladin,\u201d Haggar says, and Lance can almost feel her rolling her eyes. \u201cIt simply pains me to see a child, such as yourself, fighting valiantly for a lost cause.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a lost cause,\u201d Lance grounds out.</p>\n<p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it?\u201d Hangar asks, raising a hand to her chin. \u201cAre you fighting against the Galra, or are you fighting with them?\u201d</p>\n<p>Lance raises an eyebrow, taken aback by the question. \u201cOf course I\u2019m fighting the Galra!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWrong,\u201d she murmurs. \u201cYou truly sadden me, child. Step out, Shiro.\u201d</p>\n<p>When Shiro steps out from the shadows behind the witch, Lance feels nauseous. Shiro looks different\u2013\u2013darker, somehow. His eyes meet Lance\u2019s, and he smiles apologetically before shutting his eyes. When he reopens them, they are blank, they are yellow.</p>\n<p>They are Galra eyes.</p>\n<p>\u201cShiro?\u201d Lance whispers in horror.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat is he doing?\u201d Hunk asks. \u201cHe\u2019s talking to the witch!\u201d</p>\n<p>They can hear Lance\u2019s side of the conversation through their coms, but they cannot hear whatever the witch is telling him.</p>\n<p>Then Shiro hears Lance call out his name in disbelief, and his stomach drops. \u201cYes, Lance? I\u2019m here. I\u2019m here, kiddo. We\u2019re on our way, I promise.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat the Hell, Shiro!\u201d Lance exclaims, then, and Hunk startles. He turns to look at Shiro, confusion evident in his eyes. Shiro can only answer him with an equally puzzled look.</p>\n<p>\u201cLance, talk to me, buddy. What\u2019s going on?\u201d Shiro presses, speeding his pace and pushing his way through the rubble.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2013\u2013God, I can\u2019t believe this. No,\u201d Lance is saying, \u201cNo, you can\u2019t\u2026 Shiro\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>Realization dawns onto Shiro. \u201cHe\u2019s under the witch\u2019s control. We need to hurry!\u201d</p>\n<p>Hunk nods, hurrying alongside the older man.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cLance, I\u2019m sorry it had to come to this,\u201d Shiro says. \u201cBut it\u2019s time you knew the truth.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat the Hell, Shiro!\u201d Lance exclaims, heart beat\u00a0growing erratic.</p>\n<p>Shiro then steps closer to him, and Lance pushes himself closer to the wall behind him, nearly curling in on himself. He doesn\u2019t lower the gun, however.</p>\n<p>\u201cLance\u2026 I\u2019ve really grown to like you. You\u2019re a great pilot, you\u2019re trustworthy. I would rather have you fight by my side than be my enemy, and I think you have a lot of potential to give to the Galran army. Eventually, we will have to destroy Allura and Coran, we will use Voltron to fight alongside Zarkon\u2026 and we cannot do that without you, Pidge and Hunk. We need you to be our pilots.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2013\u2013God, I can\u2019t believe this. No,\u201d Lance wispers, \u201cNo, you can\u2019t\u2026 Shiro\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAll those team building exercises proved to me that we can fight well together as long as we have a common enemy. We needed Allura to find the lions,\u201d Shiro explains, and Lance finds that he has to look away from his yellow eyes. \u201cHowever, she convinced you that Zarkon was the enemy\u2026 and to keep the lions, to keep <em>us</em> as a team, we needed to play along with her for a while.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShut up!\u201d Lance shouts, shutting his eyes tightly. \u201cJust shut up!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThink about it, Lance! Look at this place. The Galran robots we fought were nothing more than guards to protect this planet and its people.\u201d Shiro shakes his head. \u201cRover blew up the crystal that day not because of Pidge, or because of Galra\u2026 but because of Allura. She was the only one who had the knowledge to re-program Rover. You jumped in to save Coran, didn\u2019t you? And yet we found him lying meters away from you, from the explosion\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>Lance slides down against the wall, and the gun dematerializes back to the idle bayard. \u201cShut <em>up</em>, Shiro.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy do you think the red lion was on board the Galran ship? Why do you think I never cared to take back the black bayard from Zarkon?\u201d Shiro prompts, crouching next to Lance. \u201cThink about it, Lance. The truth has been right there, the whole time.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI told you, he\u2019s too stupid,\u201d comes Keith\u2019s voice. Something about it sounds more rough. \u201cLook, Shiro, I said this before and I will say it again: maybe Lance isn\u2019t the right guy for this mission. Look, Pidge and Hunk are already on board\u2026 Lance is too oblivious to details, he\u2019s\u2013\u2013\u201d</p>\n<p>Shiro chuckles. \u201cHe won\u2019t be this way once he begins training with us, Keith. After all, he\u2019s never seen us in the training deck together, using our Galran enhancements and blood\u2026 But now he will, and he will understand our strength, our purpose.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s not going to see anything if he keeps his eyes shut like a coward,\u201d Keith glowers.</p>\n<p>Lance opens his eyes slowly, hesitantly, and inhales sharply when he\u2019s met with Shiro\u2019s yellow eyes once again. They\u2019re not gone. His eyes then snap to the left, where he could hear Keith\u2019s voice coming from and his stomach drops.</p>\n<p>That\u2019s not Keith.</p>\n<p>It can\u2019t be.</p>\n<p>\u201cKeith, you\u2019re\u2026\u201d <em>Galra\u2026 </em>But he cannot bring himself to say it. Instead, he stares at the man\u2013\u2013creature\u2013\u2013\u2013standing before him, purple skinned and yellow eyed\u2026 and yet, the same smirk continues to line his lips.</p>\n<p>\u201cGalra, yes.\u201d Keith confirms, crossing his arms. \u201cHalf-Galra, anyway.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lance\u2019s arm wraps tightly around his knee, and the bayard drops from his grip.</p>\n<p>Shiro leans in closer to him, and grips his shoulder gently. \u201cIt\u2019s too much for him to take in. We should give him some time to process it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cLance? Lance!\u201d Shiro calls out, running into the room. The witch is absent; she must have left as soon as she heard their incoming footsteps. Lance, however, is sitting on the ground, a knee on the ground and the other acting as a rest for his forehead.</p>\n<p>\u201cLance, can you hear me? We\u2019re here now, yeah? You\u2019re okay, the witch is gone.\u201d Shiro attempts to soothe.</p>\n<p>\u201cShut <em>up</em>, Shiro.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLance!\u201d Hunk calls out, running into the room. He pauses, however, at the sight. Pidge and Keith follow, not too far behind.</p>\n<p>\u201cLance, whatever you\u2019re seeing is not real.\u201d Shirt tells the younger boy. How did Haggar\u2019s magic manage to continue even after she had left? Hopefully it would not go on for much longer.</p>\n<p>\u201cLance, you okay?\u201d Keith asks, stepping into the room. He turns to Shiro. \u201cThe witch got to \u00a0him?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSeems like it.\u201d Shiro confirms, jaw clenching. \u201cLance?\u201d</p>\n<p>Lance then opens his eyes, slowly, and looks at Shiro. His eyes widen before snapping over to Keith, whom he gapes at. \u201cKeith, you\u2019re\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>Keith furrows his eyebrows again, lost. \u201cI\u2019m\u2026 what?\u201d</p>\n<p>Lance\u2019s dematerialized bayard drops to the ground, and Shiro frowns, gently placing a hand on Lance\u2019s shoulder. \u201cLance, kiddo, it\u2019s me, Shiro. Whatever you\u2019re seeing, it\u2019s not real, yeah?\u201d</p>\n<p>Lance remains tense, trapped in whatever vision the witch had laid onto him. Shiro lets out a heavy exhale, and leans in closer, wrapping Lance in his arms. Hopefully a hug would help him snap out of it.</p>\n<p>He can feel Lance\u2019s breathing grow more laboured, and he wraps him tighter. \u201cLance, buddy, you\u2019re good, you\u2019re okay. Whatever Haggar made you see is not real.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLance?\u201d Pidge calls out cautiously, stepping closer. \u201cWe\u2019re here. I\u2019m sorry we couldn\u2019t make it sooner.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lance looks up at that, and there seems to be a hint of recognition in his eyes. \u201cPidge?\u201d</p>\n<p>Pidge beams at the recognition, and she crouches next to him and Shiro. Keith and Hunk follow suit. \u201cYeah, it\u2019s me. How are you feeling?\u201d</p>\n<p>The whites in Lance\u2019s eyes begin to turn slightly red, and his lower lip trembles, ever so slightly. Hunk, unable to watch his friend like this any longer, joins the hug with Shiro. \u201cHey, whatever she showed you, it was all lies, man. You know that, right?\u201d</p>\n<p>Shiro studies Lance carefully, and a painful feeling tugs at his heart at the sight.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>When Lance hears Pidge\u2019s voice, he looks up again. Sure enough, Pidge and Hunk are standing there\u2026 and the witch is gone. \u201cPidge?\u201d He croaks.</p>\n<p>Keith, too, stands next to them\u2026 but he looks human again.</p>\n<p>Lance\u2019s eyes dart over to Shiro, and he sighs in relief at the sight of his grey irises.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, it\u2019s me. How are you feeling?\u201d Pidge asks, stepping closer. \u00a0</p>\n<p>How is he feeling? He doesn\u2019t know. How should he be feeling?</p>\n<p>Hunk then envelopes him in a hug, joining Shiro, and says: \u201cHey, whatever she showed you, it was all lies, man. You know that, right?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo we\u2019re not working for the Galra?\u201d Lance asks in a weak voice.</p>\n<p>Shiro\u2019s eyes widen, and he shakes his head immediately. \u201cNo, Lance, of course not.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo we\u2019re not bad guys?\u201d</p>\n<p>Shiro\u2019s eyes close slowly, and he runs a hand through Lance\u2019s hair. He hates how hopeful Lance sounds, how confused and <em>torn</em> he looks. \u201cNo, Lance. We\u2019re trying our best to be the good guys.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lance looks skeptical, but he gulps loudly, and nods, turning his gaze back to the ground. He can feel his eyes beginning to burn with unshed tears, but he refuses to let them fall.</p>\n<p>It was bad enough that Lance had fallen for the witch\u2019s magic, and had been unable to escape. It was even worse that he actually <em>asked </em>whether or not they were the good guys.</p>\n<p>He will <em>not</em> cry like the weak idiot he feels like.</p>\n<p>\u201cLance, Hunk, Pidge: you guys head into the cave, fight the troops there, and keep the civilians calm. Keith and I will keep watch out here.\u201d Shiro instructs. \u201cAll good?\u201d</p>\n<p>He receives a few nods in return, along with an enthusiastic \u201cyes, sir!\u201d from Lance. They had come out here with only two lions (Red and Black), and so Lance, Hunk and Pidge entered the cave on foot, grips tightening around their bayards.</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t like caves,\u201d Hunk stammers, growing nervous. \u201cIt\u2019s so dark in here.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lance nods in agreement, but Pidge scoffs. \u201cCome on, Hunk. We\u2019re guardians of the universe now. A cave shouldn\u2019t scare us\u2013\u2013even if it <em>is</em> very dark.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, Hunk has a point,\u201d Lance argues. \u201cCaves are <em>terrifying</em>. I mean, with the ocean, it\u2019s so wide and open\u2026 you can see the whole world around you! There\u2019s sun, there\u2019s land, there\u2019s water\u2026 But caves? You can\u2019t see anything, and there\u2019s no fresh air\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>Hunk nods aggressively. \u201cAnd bats, on Earth. Which means there are probably alien bats out here, which are probably much scarier, and\u2026 what if they feed on our blood?\u201d</p>\n<p>Lance pales. \u201cAlien vampire bats.\u201d</p>\n<p>As if on cue, a creature drops from above and flies over their heads. They shriek loudly, and Hunk begins patting away at his hair, trying to push it away. Once they realize it\u2019s gone, they stand up straight again, exhaling slowly. Lance cracks a sheepish grin at the other two, who begin to giggle.</p>\n<p>\u201cIs everything okay in there?\u201d Shiro asks, concerned.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, Shiro,\u201d Hunk immediately answers, clearing his throat. \u201cWe just\u2026 saw a vampire alien bat, and freaked out a little.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt was <em>not</em> a vampire alien bat,\u201d Pidge says pointedly. \u201cWe didn\u2019t even see how it looked!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you think it sparkles in the sun, like Edward Cullen?\u201d Lance wonders.</p>\n<p>Keith raises an eyebrow, having had listened to the conversation through the coms. \u201cWho\u2019s Edward Cullen?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat, Keith, you don\u2019t know Edward Cullen?\u201d Lance exclaims, halting in his steps. \u201cHello, <em>Twilight</em>? Come on, even if you hated it, you gotta know it.\u201d</p>\n<p>When he\u2019s met with silence, Lance only shakes his head, letting out a dramatic sigh. He continues trudging into the cave, then, with Hunk and Pidge at his feet.</p>\n<p>They walk in silence and darkness for a few more minutes\u2013\u2013though it feels much longer\u2013-and thankfully they do not encounter any more alien-bat-vampires. They are getting irritated, however, at the fact that they are not encountering <em>anything</em>. They had received a distress signal, claiming the Galra were here, and they had indeed fought a few soldiers upon arrival\u2026. but there appeared to be no sign of any civilians or Galra soldiers in those caves.</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay, is it just me, or is this kind of sketchy?\u201d Lance asks, a few minutes later. He stops, looking around the cave. They were walking in one straight tunnel, and it didn\u2019t seem to be leading them anywhere. Where were the civilians who had called for them?</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Shiro questions.</p>\n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s\u2026 nothing.\u201d Lance answers slowly. \u201cAre there any more Galra soldiers coming your way?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Keith answers. \u201cIt\u2019s really quiet out here.\u201d</p>\n<p>Pidge furrows her eyebrows, pushing her glasses up the bridge of her nose. \u201cDo you think they ceased the attack?\u201d A pause, then, \u201cbut even then, why haven\u2019t the civilians come out? Maybe we should ask Allura to double check if the distress signal is still going?\u201d</p>\n<p>Shiro is quiet for a while, presumably to contact Allura, and the trio in the cave wait in silence. Hunk kicks some rocks, humming a tune under his breath. The melody is cut off, however, when Shiro speaks up again: \u201cOur communications are cut off from the castle.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lance inhales sharply, and begins to tap his fingers on his bayard nervously. \u201cWhat do you mean, we\u2019re cut off from the castle?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI can\u2019t seem to contact them,\u201d Shiro says helplessly. \u201cThe signal is just not going through, and I\u2019m only getting static in response.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMaybe they should head back out of the caves?\u201d Keith suggests. \u201cSomething is really iffy. We can come back another day, make sure our com systems are back up and working well.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d Hunk says in approval. \u201cI like that idea. We should definitely get out of this place. I don\u2019t feel good about this.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lance wraps an arm around Hunk\u2019s shoulder, then nods to Pidge. \u201cMe neither, buddy. Well, let\u2019s get out of here.\u201d</p>\n<p>They turn around, walking a little faster this time, in a rush to escape the dark caves. A while later, Pidge stops and raises a hand. \u201cDo you guys hear that?\u201d</p>\n<p>Hunk and Lance come to a stop beside her, focusing carefully. Yes, they can. It sounds like\u2026 rumbling?</p>\n<p>Suddenly, the ground begins to shake beneath their feet, and Lance loses his footing, falling backwards and rolling down the path for a few metres before he crashes into a rock. He shakes his head, and pushes himself up. Thankfully, he doesn\u2019t think he\u2019s gotten too injured.</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2013\u2013Oh my God, is it an Earthquake? Are we\u2013\u2013are we getting trapped in here? What\u2019s happening, where\u2019s Lance? Oh quiznak, is it going to crash down on us?\u201d Hunk is rambling from the distance.</p>\n<p>\u201cHunk, please, calm <em>down</em>,\u201d Pidge is saying, though her voice sounds shaky as well.</p>\n<p>Lance stands up, begins to step towards them, and winces when a small joust of sharp pain shoots through his side. He inhales, and steps forward again. \u201cI don\u2019t think that was an Earthquake,\u201d he says slowly. \u201cOr\u2013\u2013a whatever-this-planet-is quake. I have a feeling this was all planned.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat, we fell into a trap? Oh, dear. How did we not see it?\u201d Hunk exclaims, his hands beginning to shake. \u201cDid the Galra plan it?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat would explain the communications being cut off from the castle,\u201d Pidge notes. Then she shakes her head. \u201cBut come on, we need to get out of here. Maybe we can run out before \u00a0the entrance gets blocked.\u201d</p>\n<p>Hunk nods quickly, and begins to run forward, Pidge at his side. Lance takes a deep breath, and springs into a sprint, following them closely. His side is throbbing, but Lance finds that he\u2019s able to push through it for now.</p>\n<p>\u201cShiro?\u201d He calls out, a little out of breath. \u201cWhat\u2019s happening out there? Is the cave being attacked from the outside, or should we watch out for infiltrators?\u201d</p>\n<p>Silence.</p>\n<p>Static.</p>\n<p>Silence.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe communications are cut off!\u201d He shouts to Hunk and Pidge. \u201cEven from Shiro and Keith?!\u201d</p>\n<p>Pidge cocks her head around in a haste, nodding at him. \u201cYeah. Must have been cut off before they could warn us.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHey, the entrance is still open!\u201d Hunk exclaims, pointing ahead of them. Sure enough, light is now streaming into the cave, providing better vision for the panicked paladins. \u201cHurry!\u201d</p>\n<p>They do. But the cave rumbles loudly again, and the ground begins to shake vigorously. Lance\u2019s jaw clenches as he attempts to hold his footing, but he is thrown into the wall next to him. He lets out a soft grunt, pushing himself away from it and focusing on getting to the exit.</p>\n<p>Push through, Lance. Push through.</p>\n<p>He makes it.</p>\n<p>As soon as he\u2019s out of the cave, he leans over, hands on his knees, and allows himself to suck in all the oxygen his lungs are burning for. As soon as he\u2019s caught his breath, he stands up straight again and turns around to look at Pidge and Hunk. \u201cWe made it, guys, that was <em>close\u2013\u2013</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>But Hunk and Pidge are not there.</p>\n<p>The entrance is blocked now, piles and piles of rocks covering it up.</p>\n<p>\u201cPidge! Hunk!\u201d He screams, running back over to the entrance. He pushes against the rocks with all his strength, but they won\u2019t <em>budge. </em>\u201cHunk! Pidge!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLance!\u201d It\u2019s Keith who calls for him. The coms must be working for him now that he\u2019s out of the cave\u2013\u2013but that means he can no longer contact Hunk and Pidge. \u201cLance, are you alright?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m\u2013\u2013I\u2019m\u2013\u2013\u201d Lance stammers, punching the rocks. \u201cHunk! Pidge! They\u2019re\u2013\u2013They\u2019re inside! They\u2019re\u2013\u2013Shiro! Hunk and Pidge are stuck, they\u2019re\u2013\u2013they\u2019re trapped, they\u2019re\u2013\u2013\u201d</p>\n<p>They\u2019re inside. What if the rocks had fell onto them, injuring them badly? Or\u2026 Or what if one of them was trapped under a rock, unable to pull their leg or arm from beneath it? What if they couldn\u2019t see <em>each other</em> in there?</p>\n<p>Lance\u2019s mind begins to run with endless theories, spiking his panic. His friends are trapped there, and he\u2019s not. He made it out, somehow, despite having been behind them <em>and</em> having gotten a little injured. How did he manage to make it out first? That\u2013\u2013that just wasn\u2019t fair. It made no sense. They should have been the ones to get out. What if he had blocked their path when he ran in front of them? What if\u2013\u2013</p>\n<p>\u201cLance, calm down,\u201d Shiro commands gently. The black lion lets out a laser beam, taking down the last Galran fleet, and turns towards Lance and the cave entrance.</p>\n<p>Lance slips away from the entrance, looking up at the black lion. His eyes are glassy, red with unshed tears, and his hands have clenched into fists by his sides. \u201cThey\u2019re <em>inside</em>, Shiro.\u201d He says in a broken voice.</p>\n<p>Shiro lets out a shaky exhale. \u201cI know, Lance. But don\u2019t worry, we can get them out. I\u2019m sure they\u2019re alright\u2026 we just need to take down this wall of rocks. It shouldn\u2019t be too hard when we got both Red and Black here to help us out.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lance stares at him\u2013\u2013well, stares at Black, but Shiro can still feel his gaze\u2013\u2013for a long moment before blinking quickly and nodding. He doesn\u2019t seem too convinced, but he doesn\u2019t argue.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you come up and ride with me in Black?\u201d Shiro offers. Black then rests her chin on the ground, and opens her jaw, sliding down the ramp for Lance to climb.</p>\n<p>Lance nods, and makes his way up to the cockpit, standing next to Shiro.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou alright, kiddo?\u201d Shiro asks, smiling weakly. Lance doesn\u2019t appear to be physically hurt, but the look on his face is worrying.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d Lance answers, though visibly tense. \u201cI\u2019m just\u2026 They\u2019re stuck there, Shiro.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cRed and I are going to start working on these rocks,\u201d Keith announces.</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay, Keith. Thank you.\u201d Shiro says. \u201cAnd yes, Lance, but like I said: we\u2019re going to get them out.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut I got out. And they didn\u2019t.\u201d Lance\u2019s breathing begins to grow laboured. \u201cI was behind them and I was more injured than them and.. and I pushed forward and made it out and they didn\u2019t.\u201d His voice is barely above a whisper by the time he finishes.</p>\n<p>Shiro furrows his eyebrows, and motions for Lance to come closer. When Lance steps towards him, Shiro gently squeezes Lance\u2019s arm. \u201cHey, at least you\u2019re out here, and we know that nothing too bad happened back there\u2026 you were all near the entrance, weren\u2019t you?\u201d</p>\n<p>Lance nods. \u201cYes. But\u2013\u2013but what if a fleet attacked them after the entrance closed? I should have stayed to help them.\u201d His shoulders sag. \u201cShiro, what if they needed my help? I ran alone, I didn\u2019t check if they were caught up\u2026 They deserved to be the ones who made it out, not <em>me.</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHey, no, don\u2019t do that to yourself.\u201d Shiro presses. He unbuckles his belt, and stands up next to Lance. \u201cThey\u2019re going to be alright. And why would you say that they <em>deserved</em> to be out here but not you?\u201d</p>\n<p>Lance shrugs, lower lip beginning to tremble.</p>\n<p>\u201cLance.\u201d Shiro pushes. \u201cYou <em>all</em> deserve to be safe and saved, none of you more-so than the other. We\u2019re a team, Lance\u2013\u2013\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>You\u2019re</em> a team,\u201d Lance grounds out, shaking his head. \u201cYou guys can communicate through your paladin bond, your lions can communicate very well together\u2026 You know I can\u2019t do that. If you lose any of <em>them</em>, then you lose Voltron. If you lose <em>me</em>, then you can find another paladin who will probably do the job much better.\u201d</p>\n<p>Shiro\u2019s eyes widen. Had that mission not left Lance\u2019s head? True, he had been unable to feel the paladin bond\u2026 but that did not mean that he was <em>undeserving</em> of being one, or that he was of any less value than his teammates\u2026</p>\n<p>\u201cLance,\u201d Shiro begins to say, before he is cut off by Hunk\u2019s loud voice blaring through the coms.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhoa, we\u2019re <em>free</em>!\u201d He exclaims, running out into the field and hugging Red\u2019s forelimb. \u201cLance, we actually <em>saw</em> the vampire-bat-alien! And it wasn\u2019t scary at all! It was actually very cuddly!\u201d</p>\n<p>Lance lets out a soft breath, and turns around before Shiro can finish speaking. He makes his way down to the field, and hugs Hunk tight. When they break the hug, he immediately turns to Pidge, hugging her as well. He doesn\u2019t care if she grumbles something under her breath\u2026. She\u2019s <em>alive</em>.</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you guys okay?\u201d He asks. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry, I didn\u2019t realize you guys were behind until after I made it out and didn\u2019t find you there\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>Hunk giggles. <em>Giggles.</em> \u201cNo worries, man. It seems you guys did all the kickass fighting out there. I was really scared at first, but then Edward Cullen came and comforted us. I\u2019m calling it that because it actually kind of glittered in the sun\u2013\u2013can you believe it!\u201d</p>\n<p>Lance stares at his friend for a long moment, before smiling weakly. They were alright. They were happy. He\u2019s not going to be the one to break the mood\u2026 especially when he hadn\u2019t been the one to even get trapped in that cave.</p>\n<p>So, he grins, and throws his hands up in disbelief. \u201cWhat! I knew it!\u201d</p>\n<p>He also misses the sad and concerned smile Shiro directs at him.</p>\n<p>\u201cLance, focus!\u201d</p>\n<p>Lance snaps out of his trance, eyes widening as he turns to look at Keith. \u201cWh\u2013what?\u201d</p>\n<p>The team is sitting on the big, sunken couches in the main hall, discussing upcoming battle plans and new training ideas. Lance, honestly, does not remember how he fell out of focus\u2013\u2013one moment he was listening, the other he was snapping back to reality at Keith calling his name. Whatever had had in between was a mystery.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis is important,\u201d Allura scolds, crossing her arms. \u201cPlease, Lance, focus with us.\u201d</p>\n<p>Shiro\u2019s gaze travels from Allura, to Keith, to Lance. Lance looks very <em>pale</em>, and it\u2019s not a look Shiro is used to seeing on the younger paladin\u2019s face. He notices how Lance\u2019s expression drops, shame colouring his cheeks, and decides to add: \u201cYou\u2019re part of the team, Lance, that\u2019s all. We really value your input, we want to make sure we\u2019re all on the same page.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lance nods, and sits up straighter. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I don\u2019t know what happened. I\u2019m all ears.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cVery well. We were discussing the use of your bayards,\u201d Allura says. \u201cIn the past, the paladins began to evolve new forms of their bayards. You may have started with a specific weapon, but you may find that it can form into something else as you need it to.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you think mine could form into a bow and arrow?\u201d Hunk wonders. \u201cI\u2019m actually good at archery. I\u2019ve always wanted my own bow and arrow, you know? Especially if it\u2019s a high tech bayard one.\u201d</p>\n<p>Allura smiles. \u201cThat\u2019s very possible.\u201d</p>\n<p>Keith glances at Lance, furrowing his eyebrows. Normally, Lance would have taken this opportunity to make a countless number of inappropriate and/or aggravating comments. Keith nudges him with his shoulder, and says, \u201cI bet that Lance\u2019s bayard could <em>never</em> transform into a sword that\u2019s as cool as mine, though.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lance cracks a weak grin, and pushes Keith lightly. \u201cNo, but I bet it could make something way <em>better</em>. And your bayard could probably only transform into a water gun instead of an actual, badass long-range weapon like mine.\u201d</p>\n<p>Keith places a finger under his chin, exaggerating a thoughtful expression. \u201cWell, Blue is the water lion. Since Red is the fire lion, it would mean I could get a <em>flamethrower</em>, which is way cooler than your current weapon\u2026 so I still win.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lance grumbles something under his breath, and rolls his eyes, enticing a few chuckles from around the room.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~ \u00a0~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2026 And the blue lion should then activate its ice ray, to give the rest of you enough time to pass around the monster before it breaks free,\u201d Allura instructs. \u201cIs that all clear?\u201d</p>\n<p>The team nods\u2013\u2013all save for Lance, who\u2019s nodding off. He\u2019s leaning forward, arms over his head, and he does not appear to be listening to Allura. It spikes her anger. \u201cLance!\u201d She shouts, clenching her fists. \u201cAre you not listening?\u201d</p>\n<p>Lance does not answer.</p>\n<p>Keith huffs out impatiently and shoves him, \u201cLance!\u201d</p>\n<p>Lance topples to the side, then startles, eyes snapping open. \u201cAh\u2013\u2013\u201d</p>\n<p>Allura stands up, glaring him down. \u201cLance, that\u2019s <em>enough</em>. You are the protectors of the universe, the defenders\u2013\u2013and you think this is a time for you to be dozing off into sleep? You are a solider, not a child. The <em>lives</em> of people are at stake, we can\u2019t afford to make any mistakes.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lance furrows his eyebrows, not quite able to focus on what Allura is saying. His head feels extremely heavy, and his eyes are burning. When he attempts to sit up, he has to shut his eyes to stop the dizziness and the black spots.</p>\n<p>Keith\u2019s hand is on him again, then, gripping tightly and attempting to move him. Allura is still angrily snapping at him. Hunk is muttering something under his breath. Pidge is making snide remarks.</p>\n<p>\u201cI told you,\u201d Pidge says with a small pout, \u201cthis is why he couldn\u2019t feel the paladin bond!\u201d</p>\n<p>Suddenly, everything is suffocating. The voices, the touch, the heavy air, the sounds of everyone\u2019s breathing, the shuffling of fabric\u2026. It\u2019s too much. \u00a0It\u2019s too much, and Lance has to fight to push down the nausea.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou are not listening to me,\u201d Allura says in disbelief. \u201cDo you think this is funny? You are being impeccably disrespectful, Lance. I expected better of you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lance wants to argue, wants to tell her that he\u2019s <em>trying</em>, but he can\u2019t. Instead, all that comes out is a soft whimper. Keith\u2019s grip tightens on his arm (whether in anger or concern\u00a0Lance cannot really tell), and Lance claws at it, pushing it away.</p>\n<p>Then, Lance\u00a0thinks he can see his older brother, poking at him, gripping at his arm tightly as he teases him.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Get off</em>,\u201d he whispers, his eyes still shut.</p>\n<p>Keith is about to retort with an angry comment, but Shiro puts a hand on his shoulder and shakes his head. Keith crosses his arms and sits back, which gives Shiro some room.</p>\n<p>\u201cLance?\u201d Shiro asks, voice gentle. He puts a hand on Lance\u2019s cheek. \u201cAre you feeling alright, kiddo?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPap\u00e1?\u201d Lance asks, leaning into the touch.</p>\n<p>Pidge lets out a soft snort. \u201cDid you just call Shiro <em>Papa</em>?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPidge,\u201d Shiro snaps, but without heat. He\u2019s alarmed by Lance\u2019s response. The boy\u2019s face is <em>burning</em> to the touch, and he must be extremely tired if he is unable to keep his eyes open or his head lifted. But calling Shiro his pap\u00e1? That is even more worrying.</p>\n<p>What if Lance has a fever? What if he\u2019s\u2026 hallucinating?</p>\n<p>\u2026 How had they not noticed any earlier?</p>\n<p>\u201cLance, it\u2019s me, Shiro,\u201d Shiro says, now holding Lance\u2019s head between his hands. \u201cCan you open your eyes for me?\u201d</p>\n<p>A shaky exhale from Lance, before he decides, \u201cNo.\u201d</p>\n<p>Shiro gulps, beginning to grow nervous. He had never had to deal with someone growing ill back on Earth\u2026 what is he supposed to do when they\u2019re in outer space? His head begins to race with questions; Lance is clearly ill. What virus had he contracted? How serious would it be? Did they have any medications for it?</p>\n<p>He can feel the rising anxiety in the room. Keith is now sitting up stiffly, looking tense and worried. Hunk is pale, and Pidge looks scared. Allura and Coran only seem to be puzzled, looking from Lance to Shiro and back.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat are you feeling, Lance?\u201d Shiro asks, turning his attention back to the blue paladin.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo estoy bueno,\u201d Lance admits, voice barely above a whisper. \u201cPap\u00e1? Estoy en casa?\u201d</p>\n<p>\n<em>I\u2019m not okay. Pap\u00e1, am I home?</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u201cLance, you\u2019re burning up.\u201d Shiro says, attempting to keep his voice level. \u201cI\u2019m not your Pap\u00e1, but\u2026 but maybe you can pretend I\u2019m your space Pap\u00e1 for now, yeah? Can you listen to your space Pap\u00e1?\u201d</p>\n<p>Everyone is now standing up, looking pale and concerned.</p>\n<p>\u201cS\u00ed.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay. Okay, good. I need you to tell me what you\u2019re feeling. In English, if you can.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lance raises an eyebrow at that, but nods. \u201cEnglish? Sorry. S\u00ed, I feel dizzy.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Shiro mutters. Then he strokes his thumb softly over Lance\u2019s cheek, urging him to continue. \u201cAnything else?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWant to vomit.\u201d Then, because he\u2019s <em>Lance</em>, he actually cracks a weak smirk. \u201cLike Hunk.\u201d</p>\n<p>Hunk chuckles nervously, then licks his dry lips.</p>\n<p>\u201cLike Hunk, huh?\u201d Shiro gives him a small smile. \u201cOkay. Do you think you can stand up at all?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Lance answers. \u201cWanna sleep.\u201d</p>\n<p>Shiro exhales patiently, then turns his gaze to Allura. \u201cHe\u2019s ill. That\u2019s why he was not listening to you\u2026 as you can see. Do you have any medications?\u201d</p>\n<p>Allura\u2019s eyes widen, guilt resting heavy in her chest. She looks to Coran. \u201cI\u2026 we\u2019d have to run tests on him to see what\u2019s causing it. Have any of you noticed him coming into contact with any unusual substances?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Hunk answers, fiddling with his jacket\u2019s zipper. \u201cAnd everything he ate we ate as well.\u201d</p>\n<p>Pidge and Keith shake her heads\u2026. then Keith\u2019s eyes widen. \u201cOur last mission was when we were lured to the cave and Pidge and Hunk got trapped. He mentioned that he got more injured than Pidge and Hunk\u2026 when he was talking to you, Shiro.\u201d His cheeks tinge red, slightly ashamed. \u201cI overheard you on the coms.\u201d</p>\n<p>Shiro lets it slide. They <em>had</em> been on the coms, but they had not remembered that Keith could be listening. \u201cYou\u2019re right. But that was over three, four days ago now.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, viral infections tend to show symptoms after a few days, usually.\u201d Hunk informs them. \u201cThat\u2019s why when your sibling gets sick or something, you tend to get sick after them. It\u2019s because by the time your symptoms begin to show, theirs have been treated. That\u2019s what I learned, anyway.\u201d</p>\n<p>Allura shakes her head, looking sadly at Lance. \u201cWhy had none of you informed us that he was injured that day? I thought he was alright, save for a few minor cuts and bruises.\u201d</p>\n<p>Coran pales. \u201cThe cuts. He had a cut on his neck, that he said he obtained when he fell, but it hadn\u2019t been deep at all. Do you think something could have entered through there?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe had a cut on his neck?\u201d Shiro questions. Lance had told Coran, but not him? Shiro feels a pang of\u2026 envy, perhaps? Or is it anger at himself, for the fact that Lance could not entrust him with such information?</p>\n<p>Or the fact that he had not noticed its presence to begin with.</p>\n<p>Coran nods, stepping closer. He pushes down the neck of the black under-suit (which Coran had helped him sew back in place of the cuts) to reveal the cut he had mentioned.</p>\n<p>Pidge scrunches her nose at the sight. \u201cOh, Quiznak\u2026 It\u2019s <em>purple</em>. Why is it purple?\u201d</p>\n<p>Keith does not like how unresponsive Lance is being to the whole situation. \u201cLance? Had the cut been purple for a long time, or was this sudden?\u201d He asks. When Lance does not answer, Keith crouches down next to the couch, and places a hand on his knee. \u201cLance. How long has the cut been bothering you?\u201d</p>\n<p>Lance stirs, now cradled in Shiro\u2019s arms, and attempts to open his eyes. He manages to open them into narrow slips, but it\u2019s enough to make Keith sigh out in relief. \u201cLast morning,\u201d he slurs. Then he clears his throat. \u201cThis morning it felt worse.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLast morning?\u201d Hunk sputters. \u201cLance, why didn\u2019t you tell us?!\u201d</p>\n<p>Lance simply shrugs, shutting his eyes again and resting his head back against Shiro\u2019s shoulder. \u201cDunno,\u201d he murmurs. \u201cDidn\u2019t matter.\u201d</p>\n<p>\n<em>Didn\u2019t matter.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Didn\u2019t deserve to be the one to make it out.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Didn\u2019t deserve to be a paladin.</em>\n</p>\n<p>Shiro\u2019s jaw clenches, and he subconsciously tightens his grip around Lance, bringing him in closer. \u00a0The boy\u2019s body is very, very hot. The armour can\u2019t be helping with that. \u201cWe should get him in lighter clothes,\u201d he suggests.</p>\n<p>\u201cGood idea,\u201d Coran agrees. \u201cAnd we should run the tests on him as soon as possible.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy can\u2019t you just pop him into the healing pod? That helps, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d Hunk asks.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, the pod does have its benefits\u2026 But it mainly aids in healing physical wounds and overall exhaustion. If Lance has an infection, then it would need to be treated separately before we can have him use the healing pod for overall energy restoration.\u201d</p>\n<p>Keith curses under his breath.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, we should hurry. While Shiro and I get him out of his heavy armour, one of you kids should go grab him something else to slip into. The other two, please get him some water and nunville. Allura, I trust you\u2019ll start up the testing station?\u201d Coran instructs. \u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course.\u201d Allura assures him, then sets off to work. The three paladins look at Lance worriedly before nodding and following Allura outside the room.</p>\n<p>Shiro and Coran then begin to remove the armour carefully. Once the chest plate is removed, Lance inhales deeply, grateful for the oxygen he hadn\u2019t realized he\u2019d needed. As they work away on the rest of the armour, Shiro looks at Coran hesitantly. \u201cWhen did he tell you about the cuts?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, he didn\u2019t.\u201d Coran answers, eyes still fixed on the armour. \u201cI noticed that his hand kept rubbing at his neck underneath the \u2018hoodie\u2019 on his jacket, and asked him if he was alright. Of course, he jumped to say that he was. But then a while later he flinched, and his hand shot straight back to his neck, and I told him there was no good in hiding. He showed it to me, but it didn\u2019t look\u2026 bad. He assured me it was just a little itchy, but nothing deep.\u201d</p>\n<p>So Coran had been the one who noticed Lance\u2019s discomfort\u2026 When Shiro couldn\u2019t.</p>\n<p>\u201cI know,\u201d Coran continues. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have let it pass. I should have gotten it tested. But this boy\u2013\u2013he can be so convincing! He laughs it off and jokes around, makes you forget why you were berating him to begin with. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, you don\u2019t need to apologize, Coran.\u201d Shiro says quietly. \u201cI just\u2026 I guess I\u2019m angry with myself for not noticing it. He <em>told</em> me that he\u2019d gotten more injured than Pidge and Hunk, but I was focused on what he was saying about how he didn\u2019t deserve\u2026\u201d Deep breath. \u201cI should have asked him to elaborate about his injuries.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cS\u2019okay, Pap\u00e1,\u201d comes Lance\u2019s small voice. \u201cLo Siento.\u201d Shiro startles, but soon collects himself. He\u2019s unsure of what to say. Is Lance calling <em>him</em> Pap\u00e1, or is he imagining his real father again?</p>\n<p>Coran studies Shiro carefully. \u201cDon\u2019t blame yourself, Shiro.\u201d</p>\n<p>Shiro can only turn his gaze back to the armour.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Fever is one thing. Pain is another.</p>\n<p>Keith doesn\u2019t think he can handle it when he hears Lance scream out in pain. <em>Again</em>.</p>\n<p>\u201cLance, Lance,\u201d Hunk is calling soothingly. \u201cLance, talk to me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNnn\u2014uh.\u201d Lance moans, curling in on himself. \u201cHurts. Mama, it <em>hurts</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>Pidge tugs at Keith\u2019s sleeve, subconsciously clinging to him for comfort. She\u2019s close to tears, and Keith does not hesitate to wrap an arm around her shoulder, tugging her closer.</p>\n<p>\u201cLance, where does it hurt?\u201d Shiro asks gently, running a hand through Lance\u2019s hair. They\u2019re back in the main lounge now, after having run the tests on Lance, and Lance is lying down across the sunken couch, head resting over Hunk\u2019s lap. Shiro is sitting on the ground next to them.</p>\n<p>\u201cEverywhere,\u201d Lance breathes out. \u201cMake it stop, Mama, por favor. Hazlo parar, <em>make it stop</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>Allura walks into the room, then, and she\u2019s a little out of breath. She\u2019d hurried immediately from the testing room. \u201cThe results are out,\u201d she says. \u201cHe\u2019s got an infection. Thankfully, it\u2019s not a very foreign one\u2013\u2013it\u2019s one Altean children often deal with. It\u2019s only because he\u2019s not, well, Altean that the symptoms are so much more severe for him.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGhh-aaa!\u201d Lance yells out. Then, in a hoarse voice, \u201cMari? Where\u2019s Mama?\u201d</p>\n<p>Allura raises an eyebrow in question. \u201cWho\u2019s Mari? And how is he faring?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s in pain,\u201d Shiro says desperately. \u201cHe\u2019s in a lot of pain. And he\u2019s got fever, and he\u2019s unaware of his surroundings. If you have an antidote, Allura, please hurry with it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI have it,\u201d Allura tells him, revealing a small bottle in her palm. \u201cI\u2019m just\u2026 I\u2019m just worried.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAbout what?\u201d Keith demands, stomping over to her. He reaches out for the antidote. \u201cHe\u2019s hurting! What are you waiting for?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cKeith, please!\u201d Allura steps back defensively. \u201cI don\u2019t want to see him hurting any more than you do. It\u2019s just that\u2026 this potion is meant for Altean adults. I\u2019m not sure how well a human adolescent can tolerate it. I\u2019m afraid of the counter effects.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnything is probably better than this!\u201d Pidge exclaims, hands clenching into fists at her sides. \u201cPlease, Allura.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe could <em>die!</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>They are stunned into silence at Allura\u2019s words.</p>\n<p>\u201cI just\u2026 I need more time, that\u2019s all I ask. I will dilute it, or I will figure out how much of it I can safely give him, or what doses he can tolerate\u2026 Please. Just give me a little more time.\u201d</p>\n<p>Hunk\u2019s eyes water, and he looks down at Lance, who is flinching. More time? That would only be more suffering for Lance.</p>\n<p>But if it means a better antidote, then perhaps it is worth the wait.</p>\n<p>Shiro nods weakly, and Allura thanks him before hurrying out of the room and to the lab. Pidge follows her out, keen on helping.</p>\n<p>The men sit in the room for another hour, soothing and comforting Lance as much as they can. The pain is not consistent, thankfully, as it comes in intervals, and it appears that Lance grows more incoherent with the stronger jousts of pain.</p>\n<p>\u201cPap\u00e1?\u201d Lance calls out a while later, when his pain has dimmed down. His voice is a little stronger, but still tinged with pain.</p>\n<p>Shiro turns to him immediately. \u00a0He can\u2019t stop the stinging in his eyes, or the tears that brim his ducts. \u201cLance.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAh,\u201d Lance notes. \u201cSpace Pap\u00e1.\u201d</p>\n<p>Shiro chuckles, despite himself. And for the first time in a long, long time\u2026 A tear slips out of his eyes, running a path down his cheek. \u201cYes, Lance? I\u2019m here.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lance cracks his eyes open, but just barely. He seems to study Shiro for a while. \u201cYou\u2019re crying.\u201d</p>\n<p>Shiro\u2019s eyes widen, and he immediately wipes at his eyes. Lance does not need to see this\u2013\u2013he needs to see a strong Shiro, one that will comfort him and\u2013\u2013</p>\n<p>\u201cS\u2019okay,\u201d Lance says, giving him a small smile. \u201cM\u2019sorry.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Shiro shakes his head. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to apologize, Lance. No, just\u2013\u2013No, don\u2019t apologize. We\u2019re all sorry, but you\u2026 You just rest, okay? We\u2019re all here.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2026 form Voltron.\u201d Lance mumbles.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat was that, Lance?\u201d Hunk asks. \u201cCouldn\u2019t hear you fully there, bud.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou can\u2019t form Voltron, \u2018cause I\u2019m sick. Sorry.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHey, we don\u2019t really need to form Voltron right now anyway,\u201d Keith says, stepping closer. \u201cAnd if anything happens, then we\u2019ll handle it with our lions. Don\u2019t worry about us. Just worry about getting better, okay?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re nice,\u201d Lance notes. \u201cUnusual. Am I dying?\u201d</p>\n<p>Keith and Hunk share a surprised look, and Shiro shifts, disturbed by the blue paladin\u2019s question. \u201cNo, Lance, of course not. Why would you think that?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHurts.\u201d Lance explains. His lip begins to quiver. \u201cFeel like I\u2019m floating.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s just the infection, Lance,\u201d Shiro promises. \u201cIt\u2019s the fever and the infection. You\u2019re not dying, I promise you that. Allura is just fixing you some Altean antibiotics. Pretty cool, yeah?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Lance agrees, albeit uncertainly. His gaze shifts up to Keith, then, with visible effort\u2026 and he\u2019s surprised to see that Keith, too, is on the verge of tears. And he can hear Hunk and Coran sniffling behind him.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s probably dying, then. Why else would they all be so sad?</p>\n<p>But he doesn\u2019t want them to be sad, not when he\u2019s dying. Lance has wanted to make everyone smile his whole life\u2026 he doesn\u2019t want them crying when he\u2019s on his deathbed. And so, he fights back his own tears, and tries to grin as big as he can. \u201cHey, Pap\u00e1?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, Lance?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIf you\u2019re my space Pap\u00e1, then am I your space <em>hijo</em>?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIf you want to be my space son, then you can be.\u201d Shiro says, smiling. \u201cEven though I <em>am</em> only seven years older than you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, not son.\u201d Lance argues. \u201cKeith \u2019n Hunk are your sons. M\u2019your <em>hijo</em>, the latino son. Special.\u201d</p>\n<p>That elicits a chuckle from everyone else in the room. \u201cOf course you are, Lance,\u201d Keith says, rolling his eyes\u2013\u2013though a smile is still on his face.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got it!\u201d Allura announces, rushing back into the room with Pidge. She\u2019s carrying a small cup in her hands. \u201cWe\u2019ve managed to work it into a diluted drink, with the perfect dosage for a human body. Pidge helped me figure it out.\u201d She turns to Pidge. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Pidge smiles, and shrugs humbly. \u201cHow is Lance feeling?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s sleeping again,\u201d Coran tells her. \u201cAlthough he was felling better just earlier. The pain seems to come and go. Hunk, or Shiro, perhaps you should wake him up now?\u201d</p>\n<p>They do. He\u2019s not quite as coherent as he had been earlier, cracking jokes and all, but at least he\u2019s not in a lot of pain. They help him sit up, his back laying across Hunk\u2019s chest. Shiro takes the drink from Allura\u2019s hands, and presses it to Lance\u2019s lips carefully.</p>\n<p>\u201cDrink it slow, hijo,\u201d Shiro says, smiling softly. \u201cThis should help you feel a lot better. Then you can rest in the healing pod for a day, and you\u2019ll come back feeling better than ever. Okay?\u201d</p>\n<p>Lance doesn\u2019t open his eyes, but he attempts to nod before sipping away at the drink.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s going to get better.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Look at this wonderful drawing @voltic-mayhem on tumblr drew for this chapter! x</p>\n<p>\n<img src=\"https://68.media.tumblr.com/ba07c18249a55433a407c143f95ee681/tumblr_ogcflyQ1Ui1upd1cjo4_540.png\" alt width=\"304\" height=\"225\">\n</p>\n<p>Another wormhole. Another jump through time and space. Getting more and more distant from Earth.</p>\n<p>Getting more distant from <em>home</em>.</p>\n<p>It hurts to think about it\u2026 so Lance tries not to. He really does. Most days, he can push it to the back of his mind\u2013\u2013focus on training, focus on the mission, focus on the simulations, meet new aliens. Talk a lot, joke around, lighten the mood. It helps with forgetting how dire the situation they\u2019re living in really is.</p>\n<p>But every time he lays his head down on that pillow\u2026 it all comes crashing back down. The loneliness, the distance and the faces. Oh God, the faces. His mother smiling, then berating, then comforting\u2026 His little siblings looking mischievous, his older siblings rolling their eyes at him. His aunts, uncles, grandparents scolding him.</p>\n<p>And yet, there had always been a softness, a kindness in their eyes, that Lance had never appreciated enough.</p>\n<p>That Lance misses.</p>\n<p>Perhaps Hunk is the closest thing he has to family. Hunk is\u2026 well, Hunk. He\u2019s kind, he\u2019s caring. His eyes carry a similar warmth to his family\u2019s.</p>\n<p>A warmth that Lance really, really misses.</p>\n<p>He turns to his side, tossing around in the sheets, and drapes an arm over his eyes. He needs to sleep, or else he will end up walking late for breakfast (or missing it), and he won\u2019t be energized, and he\u2019ll have his ears chewed off by the team\u2026</p>\n<p>But if he was home, then his mom would have let him sleep in. She would have made him his favourite soup. She would have pulled him in close and listened to him ramble away, releasing all of his worries.</p>\n<p>His father would have hugged him tightly after scolding him, because he\u2019d always wanted to remind Lance that he was not angry with him for making a mistake, but had simply wanted Lance to learn from it.</p>\n<p>And now making a mistake could result in his death. Or his teammates\u2019.</p>\n<p>Or, you know, the whole universe.</p>\n<p>Lance no longer has time to learn from his mistakes\u2013\u2013he just has to be perfect. And it\u2019s <em>hard</em>. He was a seventeen-year-old (wait, maybe he turned eighteen? Who knew what date it was back on Earth), and seventeen-year-olds didn\u2019t normally have the preparation, or experience, for being defenders of the universe.</p>\n<p>So yes, it\u2019s hard. It\u2019s hard that he and Hunk are reprimanded for joking around in a training session. It\u2019s hard to see that Shiro never smiles, because he\u2019s supposed to be the wise guy in the group, despite only being twenty-five. It\u2019s hard that Pidge is only <em>fourteen</em>, and she\u2019s orbiting outer space in search of her missing family.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s hard that Allura can\u2019t seem to grasp that.</p>\n<p>And Keith\u2026 Well, it seems that he has finally met his purpose in life, has found what he\u2019s truly meant for. Which, you know\u2013\u2013good for him! Except that Lance only feels like <em>he\u2019s</em> breaking apart into tiny, tiny, uncollected pieces. That being in outer space is actually weakening him instead of helping him grow stronger.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s killing him.</p>\n<p>But who can he tell that to?</p>\n<p>Pidge and Keith wouldn\u2019t understand; this is where they\u2019ve fought to be. Shiro would pity him\u2013\u2013which is not good, because Lance doesn\u2019t need pity, and he doesn\u2019t need Shiro to lose his trust in him for being so weak. Hunk <em>would</em> listen, but\u2026 how can Lance vent about his problems when Hunk is suffering all the same?</p>\n<p>So Lance has to keep to himself. He has to! What else would he have himself do?</p>\n<p>He sighs, knowing the answer to that. He\u2019ll just\u2026 have to push himself. Make-do with the new family, who are not really all that familial (save for Hunk, Coran, and recently\u2026 Shiro?). They\u2019re his new family now, and Lance can\u2019t afford to lose <em>them</em> too.</p>\n<p>So, he flops onto his stomach, burying his face into the pillow, and allows it to absorb his tears in silence.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat happened to you?\u201d Keith asks the following morning, raising an eyebrow. \u201cDidn\u2019t you used to walk in here in your silk robe, with glowing skin and a steaming mug of tea?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMy skin is still glowing,\u201d Lance grumbles, falling into his seat between Keith and Pidge.</p>\n<p>Keith snorts. \u201cRight. And my hair is still in a mohawk.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lance finds that he doesn\u2019t have the energy to banter, so he sighs quietly and stares at the plate of food in front of him.</p>\n<p>Food. Huh. When did he start calling space goo that? When did \u201cfood\u201d change from being spicy wraps, steaming hot soup, <em>pizza</em>? And to think he used to push away some of the food his mother used to make because \u201che didn\u2019t feel like it\u201d. God, what an idiot.</p>\n<p>He\u2019d do anything\u2013\u2013<em>anything\u2013\u2013</em>to taste her cooking one more time.</p>\n<p>\u201cLance,\u201d Allura begins, her gaze focused on him. \u201cYou are\u2013\u2013\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLate to breakfast, I <em>know</em>.\u201d He finishes. \u201cAnd I\u2019m not in paladin armour, I know that too. You don\u2019t have to point it out every single time, Allura.\u201d</p>\n<p>Well, that came out more snarky than he had expected. Not a good idea to piss off the Altean princess (especially when his fate, really, is in her hands at this point).</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s exactly it!\u201d She cries out. \u201cThere shouldn\u2019t be an \u2018every single time\u2019, Lance. This happens far too often. Zarkon can attack at any moment, and we must be ready at all times. We must\u2013\u2013\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Lance interrupts, pushing away the plate of food-goo. Who needs to eat to get energy, anyway? Apparently getting dressed in paladin armour is more important. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I\u2019ll go change.\u201d</p>\n<p>He stomps out of the room, hands shoved in his pockets and feet dragging across the ground. Right. Defenders of the universe and all that.</p>\n<p>Maybe this job really isn\u2019t meant for him.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">- - - - - -</p>\n<p><br>\u201cYou know, Allura\u2026\u201d Hunk says slowly. \u201cHe\u2019s right. You <em>don\u2019t</em> have to point it out every time. He knows it, he clearly feels bad about it. The other time he was dying because of a space virus and we were all being really harsh with him.\u201d</p>\n<p>Allura sighs. \u201cI don\u2019t mean to be insensitive,\u201d she says. \u201cI just\u2026 I think he needs to be reminded of the big picture here, of our real mission.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe does well in the field,\u201d Shiro offers. \u201cHe\u2019s improved a lot. Being a bit late to breakfast isn\u2019t really a problem for me so long as he\u2019s improving.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not saying he isn\u2019t.\u201d Allura insists. \u201cI just think his attitude needs to be set right. What if he\u2019s late for something else? What if we go under attack during breakfast? I know it\u2019s hard, but you\u2019re defenders of the universe now.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a job we actively signed up for, you know?\u201d Pidge points out. \u201cI wanted to leave at first. It wasn\u2019t my priority. But then\u2026 I also realized that being with the team means I\u2019ll be fighting whatever enemy has my father and brother. I found a personal purpose in all of this.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI would think saving the universe is a good enough purpose.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd it\u2019s an even bigger responsibility.\u201d Hunk notes. \u201cIt freaks me out, okay? I admit it. I\u2019m always terrified. I <em>want</em> to go home, but I\u2019m staying here because I have to. I have to help you, otherwise I would be a coward and I would be ruining Voltron. Doesn\u2019t mean I love it out here all the time.\u201d</p>\n<p>Allura gasps, her eyes widening. \u201cBut\u2026\u201d Her paladin does not <em>want</em> to be here? \u201cBut Paladins must find comfort in each other, in the lions. You must all believe in your purpose, it must be your top priority.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, and we\u2019re trying really hard to make it that.\u201d Pidge snaps. \u201cNone of us chose to be here. None of us chose to be paladins. But we\u2019re trying, Allura. Lance is trying, too. I can see it. He\u2019s\u2026 he\u2019s changed a lot.\u201d</p>\n<p>Hunk nods. \u201cI\u2019m just saying\u2026 this is hard for all of us. You don\u2019t need to\u2026\u201d a soft exhale, \u201c\u2026 make it harder.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cJust\u2026 appreciate that we\u2019re trying.\u201d Pidge finishes off.</p>\n<p>Allura is stunned into silence. Then she lets out a shaky breath. \u201cI do appreciate it. I appreciate all of you for being here. I just want us to be ready. We\u2019ve seen that Zarkon can attack at any time, we\u2019ve seen what he\u2019s done\u2026 I need to keep pushing you harder. Especially when you\u2019ve just revealed that you don\u2019t even wish to be here.\u201d</p>\n<p>Shiro shuts his eyes, mentally cringing. That was definitely not the point Hunk and Pidge had been trying to get across. In fact, Allura seemed to take it to the opposite direction.</p>\n<p>\u201cShe\u2019s right,\u201d Keith mutters. \u201cWhether or not we like it\u2026 this is our new life, and we just need to work hard\u2013\u2013\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd we all know you like it.\u201d Lance chimes, returning to the dining room. He leans against the doorframe, now clad in his armour. \u201cThis is your jam, isn\u2019t it? Fighting in outer space, being the coolest pilot and fighting with a sword because you\u2019re just <em>that </em>good at hand-to-hand combat. Living in a place that doesn\u2019t tolerate fun. Dry as your heart. This is your dream place.\u201d</p>\n<p>It surprises Keith to hear it, because he can\u2019t <em>deny</em> it, exactly. It also aggravates Keith to hear it, because Lance isn\u2019t smiling, or giving him a teasing grin or smirk. No, Lance is being completely serious.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd if it is? What\u2019s so wrong with that?\u201d Keith fires back. \u201cMaybe it means that I\u2019m meant to be here, that I\u2019m meant to have this duty. If you can\u2019t handle it\u2013\u2013if you would rather be helpless and cowardly, have others defending you, then that\u2019s not my problem! No one\u2019s stopping you from going back to Earth, you know! Go there, have fun. Leave the serious work to serious people.\u201d</p>\n<p>He regrets the words as soon as they\u2019re out of his mouth. \u201cI\u2019m\u2013\u2013\u201d He begins to say, fumbling. The rest of the team is staring at him in shock. Hunk\u2019s hands are shaking. Allura\u2019s fists are clenched.</p>\n<p>God <em>damn</em> his impulse speaking.</p>\n<p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll go,\u201d Lance answers. But he\u2019s not arguing back, he\u2019s not fighting. Instead, his voice is low and raspy, just above a whisper. \u201cOnce you have another blue paladin, I\u2019ll go. I don\u2019t want to be a defender of the universe. I don\u2019t want to eat space goo for the rest of my life. I don\u2019t want to live with a team who can\u2019t be my family.\u201d</p>\n<p>His eyes begin to sting, and a lump forms in his throat. There. He said it.</p>\n<p>Then, in a soft, soft voice, and with a quivering lip, he says: \u201cI want to go home.\u201d</p>\n<p>No one says anything. He can\u2019t tell if it\u2019s a stunned silence, or a pleased silence. Is this what they\u2019ve been waiting to hear? \u201cYou\u2019re right. You are meant for this job\u2026 I\u2019m not. Maybe my only job was piloting Blue for long enough to get you guys here.\u201d</p>\n<p>He exits the room.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">- - - - - -</p>\n<p>As soon as Lance leaves, the paladins find the shock settling in, and they kick back into gear. Shiro stands up immediately, hurrying to follow Lance, but stops at the doorway, inwardly cursing himself. What would he do? What would he tell the Blue Paladin?</p>\n<p>Pidge punches Keith. In the face. Hard.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat the Hell!\u201d She yells. \u201cWhat the Hell was that!\u201d She stands up, balling her hands into fists at her sides. \u201cIs that what you think, huh? You were <em>meant</em> to be here, but he wasn\u2019t? Oh, oh! And he should go home because he <em>can</em>. I thought I wasn\u2019t allowed to leave back when we saved the Arusians, because you needed me for Voltron!\u201d</p>\n<p>Hunk is shaking. \u201cYou think it\u2019s that easy? That just because he can go home, then he should? Maybe you think I should go home too, then. Maybe Lance and I still need years of training at the academy before we can become worthy of fighting by your side.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo!\u201d Keith yells back, standing up. \u201cI didn\u2019t say any of that\u2013\u2013I didn\u2019t\u2013\u2013\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s <em>exactly</em> what you said!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThen what the Hell did you mean?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s almost like you hadn\u2019t heard anything that Hunk and I were saying earlier about how we missed home but we were trying\u2013\u2013\u201d</p>\n<p>Coran stops by the room, then. Shiro is standing in the doorway, watching the other paladins fight inside the room. Allura\u2019s in there, but her eyes are shut, and she\u2019s curled up into herself, resting her elbows on the table.</p>\n<p>What in the quiznak?</p>\n<p>\u201cShiro?\u201d Coran prompts, tapping Shiro\u2019s shoulder gently. Shiro startles, and turns around, eyes wide. \u201cWhoa\u2013\u2013It\u2019s me! What\u2019s going on? I just went to get some work done in the controls room, and I come back to this.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCoran.\u201d Shiro breathes out. \u201cLance. You need to go see Lance, please. I\u2019m\u2026 I\u2019m going to talk to the team, just settle them down\u2026 Please, go find Lance. He\u2019s not doing good.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>What</em> happened?\u201d Coran repeats.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re all tired. We\u2019re all tired, and Lance wants to go back to Earth because Keith lost it and said stuff\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAlright. I\u2019ll go find Lance. You make sure those paladins don\u2019t kill each other. It\u2019d be a miracle if you can form Voltron after this.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lance doesn\u2019t go to his room. Instead, he heads straight to the hangar, where the lions are kept. As soon as he enters, Blue\u2019s particle barrier drops, welcoming him, ushering him over to her.</p>\n<p>Lance can feel her warmth, her embrace, as soon as he climbs into the cockpit. \u201cBlue,\u201d he greets, taking a seat. He slides down in the chair, crossing his arms over his lap.</p>\n<p>They sit in silence for a while, but Lance can feel Blue.</p>\n<p>She has a certain warmth that reminds Lance of <em>home</em>.</p>\n<p>Of the beach. Of his family. Of the sun.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re my new home,\u201d he tells Blue. \u201cYou\u2019re the closest thing I have to it.\u201d</p>\n<p>He can feel her purr in appreciation.</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to leave you. But\u2026 But I can\u2019t be a part of this team. I don\u2019t deserve you.\u201d</p>\n<p>She insists that he does. That she needs him, too.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need me,\u201d Lance says. \u201cYou need a good pilot. I\u2019m just a cargo pilot.\u201d</p>\n<p>Then he can\u2019t stop himself. The tears come despite his trying to push them back. He slumps even further down in the seat, and presses his palms up against his eyes, wiping at the tears. He can feel Blue\u2019s mood immediately change to one of concern.</p>\n<p>He sniffs. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I know I\u2019m very weak. The weakest paladin you\u2019ve ever had, I bet.\u201d</p>\n<p>She denies it. But Lance argues. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry, Blue. You deserve so much better.\u201d</p>\n<p>Then, she\u2019s warm again, encompassing him with that embrace, that feeling of home.</p>\n<p><em>Home</em>.</p>\n<p>Because he\u2019s her home, too. The pilot may not know that, may not feel it\u2026 But she has never had a bond this strong with any of her prior paladins. None who had been so compassionate, so refreshing and friendly. None who had been so open with her.</p>\n<p>And Lance is her home now, he\u2019s her family. She doesn\u2019t want him to leave. She\u2019ll protect him from anything\u2013\u2013and anyone\u2013\u2013who brings him harm, whether physically or emotionally. She will keep him safe.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s why when Coran eventually makes his way to the hangar while Lance is dozing off, she refuses to bring down her particle barrier.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s <em>enough</em>,\u201d Shiro repeats for the third time. He pushes Keith back (not harshly) from where he\u2019s towering over Pidge. \u201c<em>Keith</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>They finally, <em>finally</em>, stop.</p>\n<p>\u201cShiro. I didn\u2019t meant it like that. I was just\u2013\u2013I was just annoyed by his attitude and I\u2013\u2013\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd you told him to leave the team!\u201d Pidge hollers. Shiro shushes her.</p>\n<p>\u201cStop it.\u201d He snaps. \u201cStop. Keith, you need to apologize to Lance, okay? He, along with Pidge and Hunk, were more annoyed by <em>your</em> attitude. This place\u2026 it feels more like home for me and you. But that doesn\u2019t mean it has to only be <em>our</em> home. Pidge and Hunk\u2013\u2013you guys opened up about your feelings today, and I really appreciate that. We\u2019re going work hard to take it into account, I promise. You guys are trying, oh\u2026 you\u2019re trying very hard. I know that we inwardly appreciate you, but we need to show it more.\u201d</p>\n<p>He looks to Allura, who turns her gaze away.</p>\n<p>\u201cThey didn\u2019t have the training you had, Keith.\u201d He continues. \u201cAnd they don\u2019t have the Altean strength, Allura. They\u2019re <em>young</em>, we all are. Lance is\u2026 He\u2019s very homesick. Has been for a long, long time. I never consulted him about it. I never comforted him, like I comforted you, Pidge. I never told him to improve so he can show his family, either, like I had told Hunk.\u201d</p>\n<p>Pidge looks down to the floor, tears welling up in her eyes. \u201cHe said he doesn\u2019t want to live with a team who can\u2019t be his family.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, we\u2019re not <em>really</em> a family.\u201d Hunk supplies. \u201cWe\u2019re good friends, I think. Most of us. But\u2026 we\u2019re teammates. We\u2019ve never had a bonding exercise that wasn\u2019t training related, or Voltron related. We\u2019ve never played any games, we\u2019re never allowed to go and have fun on planets we visit after a mission.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re always alert,\u201d Keith argues weakly. \u201cWe\u2019re preparing\u2013\u2013\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFor what?\u201d Hunk storms, then. His voice never rises this high, but he can\u2019t help it. \u201cFor our own deaths? Lance has <em>changed</em>, Keith. He hasn\u2019t spoken about his family in a long time. Not because he\u2019s forgotten them, but because when he does mention them, his expression drops and he\u2019s on the verge of tears. He doesn\u2019t take care of himself anymore\u2013\u2013you said it yourself today, his skin is no longer glowing. He\u2019s grown more quiet, more distant. I\u2019ve noticed it, but I\u2026 I never spoke up. I never knew what to say.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe used to joke around a lot more.\u201d Pidge adds.</p>\n<p>\u201cCoping mechanism.\u201d Shiro realizes. \u201cThe talking. The chatter. Someone who\u2019s grown up in such a busy household would have gotten so used to the noise, to the activity. He was supplying it in hopes of this place feeling more homely.\u201d</p>\n<p>But none of them had played along with him. None of them had noticed that if he wasn\u2019t chatting mindlessly, then Lance would carry fear and anxiety on his expressions.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd what you said,\u201d Shiro turns back to Keith. \u201cJust wasn\u2019t the right thing to say at the time. We\u2019re going to have to apologize, okay? To each other, first, then to Lance when he comes back with Coran.\u201d</p>\n<p>They stand in silence for the next few minutes, staring at their hands and shuffling their feet.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell?\u201d Shiro prods.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d Allura begins, standing up from her seat. \u201cI should apologize first. I\u2026 I am harsh. I heard Hunk and Pidge and I\u2026 I thought that I would need to make them work harder because their minds are elsewhere, thus I need to make them focus. But the only way to make you want to be here is by making you like this place. This\u2026 make-shift home, if you will. You\u2019re my team. You\u2019re paladins. But you\u2019re also so much more\u2026 You<em> have</em> become my family.\u201d</p>\n<p>Pidge smiles, surprised. Hunk\u2019s eyes begin to water.</p>\n<p>\u201cThank you, Allura.\u201d Shiro replies with a small smile. \u201cAnd the same goes for me. I don\u2019t want any of you to leave\u2013\u2013not just because of Voltron, but because I care about you, I enjoy your company. I want <em>you</em> to be here.\u201d He looks at Keith. \u201cAll of you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMe too,\u201d Keith then blurts out, turning his gaze to the ground. \u201cI don\u2019t want any of you to leave, okay? Hunk was right when he said we were like brothers after that mission. You guys <em>are</em> the only family I\u2019ve ever had. You\u2013\u2013you have high expectations for what makes a family, but I <em>don\u2019t</em>. I don\u2019t know how to be a good brother. I don\u2019t know what siblings do! I\u2019m sorry. I was just\u2026 I just\u2026 I didn\u2019t know any of you felt that way. I thought we were all content with this little family that we had.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAwh, Keith,\u201d Hunk murmurs, immediately softening up. \u201cI didn\u2019t know <em>you</em> felt that way, either. We can show you, you know? We can show you how siblings spend time playing random games, or how\u2026 or how we like, confide in each other. How we can just go crazy and not worry about someone judging us.\u201d</p>\n<p>Keith nods, biting down on his lip as his eyes begin to turn red. \u201cI always judge Lance for anything funny or crazy that he did.\u201d</p>\n<p>Pidge nods in agreement. \u201cWell, me too, sometimes. But being siblings also means arguing and throwing pillows at each other\u2026 It just never lasts. The anger, I mean. I think that\u2019s what makes a family. At the end of the day, you know you have each other, even if you had been fighting and arguing for the past two weeks.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Keith says quietly, absorbing in all the information they were giving him. \u201cThen\u2026 Then I\u2019ll learn. I\u2019ll try my best to be a good sibling. I promise.\u201d</p>\n<p>Shiro chuckles whole-heartedly, bringing Keith in for a gentle hug. When he extends his other arm out, Pidge and Hunk immediately join the group hug.</p>\n<p>Then Coran walks in, and tells them that Blue wouldn\u2019t allow him to see Lance. The mood drops, but Shiro assures them that Lance will hear them out whenever he feels a bit better.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lance awakens to the sound of alarms blaring.</p>\n<p>\u201cPaladins!\u201d Allura is calling out through the coms. \u201cWe\u2019re under attack!\u201d</p>\n<p>Lance awakens to the sound of alarms blaring.</p>\n<p>\u201cPaladins!\u201d Allura is calling out through the coms. \u201cWe\u2019re under attack!\u201d</p>\n<p>Lance startles, sitting up in the pilot\u2019s chair. He rubs at his eyes warily, trying to recall what had happened earlier, and\u2026. Oh. He\u2019d childly stormed out of breakfast because of a few words Keith had said. God <em>damn</em> it. His problem had been the team not believing he was good enough to pilot the blue lion, that he wouldn\u2019t be good enough on the battle field because he lacked that paladin bond\u2026 and he\u2019d only proven their accusations.</p>\n<p><em>I want to go home</em>, he\u2019d said.</p>\n<p>Of course he wants to go home. So do Hunk and Pidge. No one wants to be out here, fighting Zarkon and facing the possibility of death at every mission. And he\u2019d managed to be the selfish one, the cowardly one, who cared more about his own happiness and comfort than the rest of the <em>universe\u2019s</em>.</p>\n<p>They\u2019ll never forgive him.</p>\n<p>His hands begin to shake, and he shuts his eyes, allowing a soft sob to sound. He\u2019d messed up, again. He\u2019d told the team that they weren\u2019t his priority, that fighting Zarkon wasn\u2019t his priority\u2026 But that\u2019s not true! They\u2019re his priorities, along with his family back on Earth. He can have multiple priorities\u2013\u2013he just\u2026 he gets homesick at times, he gets tired\u2026</p>\n<p>But it\u2019s too late for that, now. Why would the team give him another chance? Allura had said it herself; the paladins need to focus on their mission and their mission alone. Lance couldn\u2019t do that\u2013\u2013his mind kept drifting back to his family, to the ocean, to <em>Earth</em>. It was why his paladin bond was weak: he\u2019d been focusing on the wrong things.</p>\n<p>And yet\u2026 he couldn\u2019t help it. Yes, he was weak, and he will admit that. He is weak, and he can\u2019t help but think about what he\u2019s left behind, what he may never again see.</p>\n<p>\u201cLance, are you there?\u201d Shiro\u2019s voice comes, and Lance\u2019s eyes snap open. When had he even shut them?</p>\n<p>He picks up his helmet, licking his lips drily. \u201cShiro?\u201d</p>\n<p>Shiro lets out a sigh of relief. \u201cAre you in Blue? We\u2019re going to need you out here, buddy. Zarkon\u2019s attacking the castle.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lance freezes, hands hovering over the touchpad on Blue\u2019s control panels. There is an attack, and he would need to go out there and fight\u2013\u2013alongside the team? How in the seven hells are they supposed to form Voltron?</p>\n<p><em>Can</em> he fight alongside the team?</p>\n<p>\u201cI am,\u201d he rasps. Shiro is asking him to fight with them. After the childish fit he had thrown earlier. If they are willing to fight with Lance by their side, who is he to refuse? \u201cI\u2019ll get on it. Where are they located?\u201d</p>\n<p>A hologram pops up on the display, highlighting the locations of the enemy with pulsing red dots. It seems that a fleet of Galra are nearing the castle from his direction, so Lance decides to take them on. Maybe fighting some Galra will help him focus on something else.</p>\n<p>\u201cLet\u2019s do this, Blue,\u201d he encourages, trying to bring as much strength into his voice as he can.</p>\n<p>Blue stands up, bringing down the particle barrier, and the ceiling of the hangar opens up. Lance can feel her eagerness as they fly out, heading on to attack the Galran fleet.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Shiro is almost thankful for the attack, only for the fact that he was able to speak to Lance and get him back up with the team without actually having to speak about what happened. They <em>will</em> speak about it, once they\u2019ve taken down the enemy, but hopefully by then Lance will have fallen back into the team spirit and possibly recovered a bit from his previous conversation with Keith.</p>\n<p>And so, they fight. The fleets aren\u2019t exactly strong, but there are a <em>lot</em> of them. It seems that whenever they take down one of them, three come in its place. There must be a wormhole open somewhere that\u2019s far enough that they can\u2019t detect it, but close enough that the fleets can easily make their way to them.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s frustrating.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to have to start a wormhole,\u201d Allura informs them. \u201cThe castle is taking harsh hits, and there are too many of them for you to fight.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAlright,\u201d Shiro responds. \u201cLet us know when we\u2019re ready to go!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p>\n<p>The wormhole takes a few more minutes to form, and as soon as it does, Allura calls out, \u201cWe\u2019re ready! Paladins, make your way to the wormhole immediately!\u201d</p>\n<p>They do. The Galra fleet are on their tail, but they manage to all get in there. As Allura hurriedly presses the button to close the wormhole, however, they see a wide, long bolt making its way into the wormhole with them.</p>\n<p>Nothing happens at first, and Allura allows herself to sigh out in relief.</p>\n<p>But then the wormhole begins to shake, and the castle shake along with it. The paladins begin to yell out as their lions lose contact with the castle, falling away, and then\u2026.</p>\n<p>And then they fall out of the wormhole.</p>\n<p>Allura gasps, shaking her head frantically. \u201cNo!\u201d She shouts. \u201cPaladins, can you hear me? Where are you!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAllura!\u201d Shiro calls back. \u201cOpen the hangars so Pidge and I can get back into the castle!\u201d</p>\n<p>She does. \u201cAnd the others?\u201d</p>\n<p>Shiro is silent for a few more moments, presumably as he finds his way to the hangar and climbs out of Black. Then, in a small voice, he answers: \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p>\n<p>They reach their destination, then, and the wormhole shuts behind them. Allura falls back into her chair. \u201cOh no.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lance wants to scream.</p>\n<p>Blue has shut down, <em>entirely</em>. The control panels are turned off, the communication system is turned off, their connection is off. He can no longer feel her, and it throws him off guard. He hasn\u2019t realized how accustomed he\u2019d grown to her voice, her warmth, in his head until\u2026 until he\u2019s lost it.</p>\n<p>Until he\u2019s lost <em>her</em>.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s not sure when his screams turn into sobs. He\u2019s lost Blue\u2013\u2013he\u2019s lost the closest thing he\u2019s had to home.</p>\n<p><em>Home</em>.</p>\n<p>It is only getting farther and farther away\u2026</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lance wakes up when he\u2019s thrown across the cockpit, and he lets out a soft groan, wrapping his arms around his head as he falls backwards again. It goes on for a short while before they finally come to a stop.</p>\n<p>Pushing down his nausea and the throbbing in his head, Lance brings himself to stand up. He limps his way over to the windows, realizing that he must have twisted his ankle during the crash.</p>\n<p>They\u2019re surrounded by ice. Fields of ice and snow stretch out ahead of him, beside him. There are no mountains, no hills\u2026. there is nothing but flat, icy land. \u00a0The sky is a blank, grey canvas. The atmosphere is suffocating.</p>\n<p>It makes him shudder.</p>\n<p>Blue is still out. Lance runs his hand over the control panel, urging her to wake up, hoping she will feel his touch. When she does not respond, his hands hover up to his helmet, gently prying it off. The light that normally flashes red for the communication system has lost its pulse.</p>\n<p>His gaze flickers back outside, and a hollowness fills up in his chest. His shoulders sag, and he lets his helmet drop to the ground, echoing inside the silent lion and rolling way from him.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s alone.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Eventually, it begins to grow chilly inside Blue. Then it gets colder. Lance can feel the coolness slip through the armour and onto his skin, somehow, and he curls in on himself. He wishes Keith and his Lion were here; at least Red could breathe fire, you know? He would warm the place up. But Blue could only make\u2026 more ice.</p>\n<p>If she can just wake up, if her systems turn back on\u2026 then Lance can at least activate the heating system. But she\u2019s not waking up, she\u2019s not even <em>stirring</em>.</p>\n<p>\u201cGah!\u201d He yells out, throwing his head back against the wall in anguish. His teeth are chattering, and the tip of his nose is beginning to grow numb. So he leans forward again, cradling his head in his arms, and relies on his warm breathing to bring some heat.</p>\n<p>\u201cBlue!\u201d He calls out in a muffled voice. \u201cBlue, please, <em>wake up</em>!\u201d</p>\n<p>She doesn\u2019t.</p>\n<p>Time passes. Lance isn\u2019t exactly sure how long it goes on for. When he wakes up, he grabs all the fabrics that he can find around Blue, and is thankful for the emergency fire blanket. It keeps him fairly warm\u2013\u2013for a little longer, at least. All he can do is sleep, really, before he wakes up to find that he\u2019s kicked off the blanket and hurries to wrap it around himself again.</p>\n<p>The water and ration supplies are low, so he doesn\u2019t allow himself to drink or eat more than the bare minimum. Who knows how long he will be out here?</p>\n<p>The longer Blue lies in the icy desert, the colder the cockpit begins to grow. Frost begins forming on the insides of the windows. Then it slowly makes its way to the walls.</p>\n<p>Lance can\u2019t begin to imagine what Blue must look like from the outside. Is she covered in snow? Will anyone be able to spot her when they come looking?</p>\n<p>If. If they come looking.</p>\n<p>Who would find him out here?</p>\n<p>Sometimes, when Lance dozes off, he can see his family. His mother bringing him hot soup while his father wraps a warm blanket around him, fresh out of the dryer. His older sister knitting him ugly, but comfortable, gloves and socks. His little siblings building a blanket fort around him, all huddling by his side.</p>\n<p>Sometimes, he almost feels warm.</p>\n<p>But then he wakes up again, and he\u2019s gasping, and his lungs are burning with every inhale of the cold air.</p>\n<p>He cries, at first. Allows the tears to drop. But they freeze, right on his cheekbone, and they become painful when they solidify around his tear ducts. So\u2026 no, he can\u2019t cry anymore.</p>\n<p>But he can scream. So he does.</p>\n<p>He continues to scream. Time progresses. The sky outside does not change\u2013\u2013there is no night, or morning. He is in eternal, suffocating greyness.</p>\n<p>He misses his family.</p>\n<p>No, he misses <em>both</em> his families. The one on Earth\u2026 and the one in space.</p>\n<p>How are they faring, he wonders? Did they end up stranded on other planets, too, or did they make it back safely with Allura? Oh, no. What if they were hurt? What if they were caught by the Galra? What if they needed Voltron, and his absence was stopping them?</p>\n<p>Or what if they\u2019re all home, in the castle, eating Hunk\u2019s make-do food? That. He would rather imagine that. The food is warm, and Keith and Pidge compete to shove it down. Shiro smiles at them warmly, sharing a fond look with Allura. Coran must be cleaning the pods all by himself. They\u2019re probably training, and Hunk is grumbling about how Keith is too impatient during the group practices\u2026.</p>\n<p>Lance falls asleep thinking about his family.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>When Blue wakes up\u2013\u2013God, is it days later? or is it weeks?\u2013\u2013Lance does not feel her usual purring or the soothing warmth in his mind.</p>\n<p>No, he feels her anguish. He feels her screams.</p>\n<p>It throws him off, and he startles, sitting up abruptly. A headache begins to thump in his skull, and Lance shuts his eyes, squeezing his palms up against his temples. \u201cBlue! Blue, what\u2019s going on?\u201d</p>\n<p>She relaxes, just a little, upon hearing Lance\u2019s voice. But her screams do not falter.</p>\n<p>Lance makes his way over to the Pilot\u2019s chair, which is now covered with frost. He gulps down heavily, attempting to calm his chattering teeth, and frantically runs his hands over the control panels. \u201cBlue! Blue! Calm down, <em>please</em>!\u201d</p>\n<p>A few moments later, Blue <em>finally</em> begins to calm down. Her screams turn to whimpers, and Lance finds himself joining along. \u201cBlue, please, what\u2019s hurting you?\u201d</p>\n<p>She can\u2019t move.</p>\n<p>The ice must have hit her pretty hard from the outside.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s okay, blue,\u201d Lance soothes. \u201cYou\u2019re back. You\u2019re awake, oh God, I\u2019ve missed you. Don\u2019t worry. You\u2019re\u2013\u2013you\u2019re the guardian of the water, aren\u2019t you? You breathed out ice in that fight! This ice shouldn\u2019t stop you. It won\u2019t!\u201d</p>\n<p>She\u2019s a bit hesitant.</p>\n<p>\u201cLook, now that you\u2019re back online, you can start to heat up the interior of this place. It\u2019s going to warm you up, and slowly you can melt off the ice that\u2019s around you. Or maybe you can manipulate the ice?\u201d</p>\n<p>She doesn\u2019t reply, but he can almost feel her considering the question.</p>\n<p>She has never tried to manipulate existing ice.</p>\n<p>\u201cThen\u2013\u2013then you should! First time for everything, Blue!\u201d His voice is growing higher and higher, and his hands are shaking. It\u2019s <em>freezing</em>. \u201cWe can do this!\u201d</p>\n<p>It takes a while for her confidence to build back up, but Blue eventually begins trying to move. She starts by activating the heating systems. Then, Lance can hear the ice cracking on the outside, and it almost sounds like the sound of shattering glass.</p>\n<p>It might work.</p>\n<p>\u201cAre the communications on?\u201d He asks. He hopes.</p>\n<p>They\u2019re not. At least, not yet. But they\u2019re getting back on, Blue assures him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Coran is first one to see the flashing signal.</p>\n<p>He can\u2019t believe it, at first. Can\u2019t believe that Blue\u2019s whereabouts are suddenly present on the holographic map.</p>\n<p>When the information settles in, he rushes to the common meeting room, where he knows Allura will be sitting along with at least a few of the fellow paladins. He enters, short of breath, and calls, \u201cPrincess Allura! We\u2019ve found the blue lion\u2019s signal!\u201d</p>\n<p>Allura stands up, eyes widening. \u201cYou\u2019ve located it?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, Princess!\u201d</p>\n<p>Keith and Hunk follow suit, rising to stand up. \u201cWhat? Where is he?\u201d Hunk asks.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt appears he\u2019s not so far from here, actually. He\u2019s in the same galaxy, for starters.\u201d Coran informs them. He turns around then, hurrying back to the control room, and the others follow him. \u201cBut the stats don\u2019t read it as a very\u2026 habitable planet. I do hope Lance has managed with his best.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s been stranded out there for three weeks,\u201d Keith says heavily. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t Blue\u2019s signal turn on earlier? You guys were able to find me and Hunk just a few days after we fell through the wormhole, because our lions were still online. Why would Blue turn off?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShe may have gotten a harsh hit,\u201d Allura suggests. \u201cOr they may have passed through something in the wormhole that temporarily disabled her.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI would think the latter is more likely,\u201d Coran notes. \u201cYou pass through all sorts of things in a wormhole, and if it\u2019s a wonky one, you might just stay in a place long enough for it to cause some damage. Hopefully, this damage is not too serious.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll go tell Shiro,\u201d Keith volunteers. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have to head there as soon as possible.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cLance!\u201d</p>\n<p>Lance startles awake. When had he dozed off? It\u2019s warmer inside Blue now, thank God, but he keeps the blanket wrapped around him for good measure. He can\u2019t risk growing cold again. He doesn\u2019t <em>want</em> to feel that.</p>\n<p>\u201cLance, can you hear us?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u2026 What?</p>\n<p>He must be feverish. He must be imagining Shiro\u2019s voice.</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t think he can hear us.\u201d He can hear Keith grumble. It\u2019s very realistic. \u201cMaybe he\u2019s asleep?\u201d</p>\n<p>Lance begins to shake as a pulse of Adrenaline runs through him. Could it be real? Maybe\u2026 Maybe he\u2019s not imagining their voices?</p>\n<p>Blue glows with that warmth again, and she assures him that yes, this is <em>real</em>.</p>\n<p>\u201cShiro?\u201d He rasps.</p>\n<p>Well, it sounds more like: \u201cSh-yuh?\u201d He hasn't spoken in <em>days</em>, and with all the cold air he\u2019s been inhaling\u2026. He clears his throat, and tries again. \u201cShiro.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLance!\u201d It\u2019s Hunk that calls out this time. \u201cYou\u2019re awake! You\u2019re <em>alive</em>!\u201d</p>\n<p>The others chime in with \u201cLance, buddy!\u201d and \u201cLance!!!\u201d and \u201cOh, <em>Lance</em>!\u201d</p>\n<p>A grin makes its way onto Lance\u2019s face, and he finds himself laughing.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s <em>laughing</em>.</p>\n<p>The laughter grows hysterical, but, hey\u2026 The team has contacted him. They\u2019ve contacted him!</p>\n<p>\u201cYou guys found us?\u201d He croaks, before giggling. \u201cYou found us.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, Lance. Yes, we did.\u201d Shiro assures him. \u201cWe\u2019re on our way\u2013\u2013We\u2019re already on the planet you seem to be on, but we\u2019re not sure where you are, exactly. This is\u2026 a big field of ice. Hard to know where we\u2019re going.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yes. Yes, the field of ice that has been his brief home for the past\u2026 the past\u2026 \u201cHow long?\u201d He manages to ask.</p>\n<p>Pidge seems to understand. \u201cYou\u2019ve been out here for three weeks.\u201d She lets out a shuddering breath. \u201cWe were really, <em>really</em> worried about you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Three weeks.</p>\n<p>He honestly hadn\u2019t expected he would make it that long.</p>\n<p>\u201cI spot him!\u201d Hunk calls out. \u201cBut Blue\u2019s half-covered in snow!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHold steady, Lance. We\u2019re going to dig you guys out of there.\u201d Shiro says.</p>\n<p>Well, it\u2019s not like Lance can really do anything else anyway. So he remains in his seat, hands fisting around the blanket, as his body shakes giddily. The grin does not fall off his face.</p>\n<p>Once they reach Blue, Red immediately activates its flamethrower and carefully melts the snow and ice surrounding the other lion. Once most of it has been removed, they hurry down to stand next to Blue and Lance, the other paladins following suit.</p>\n<p>All eager to see their friend once again, the paladins climb out of their lions, sliding down the face masks on their helmets to shield them from the cold. They walk in the semi-clear path Red had created, and stand before Blue\u2019s mouth, urging her to open up.</p>\n<p>She does, and they rush inside.</p>\n<p>\u201cLance!\u201d Hunk shouts, running to his friend. He wraps him in a hug immediately, squeezing tight, before letting go. \u201cWow, dude, your face is <em>cold</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lance stares at his friend, the smile frozen on his face\u2026 but his thoughts are starting to get jumbled as the reality of the situation begins to kick in.</p>\n<p>They\u2019ve found him.</p>\n<p>His team, his <em>family</em>, is here.</p>\n<p>He thought he\u2019d never see them again.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s vaguely aware of the others hugging him, patting his head or shoulders, speaking excitedly. But he loses focus; He can\u2019t hear what they\u2019re saying, he can\u2019t really focus on who\u2019s touching him\u2026</p>\n<p>The exhaustion, the pain, the loneliness, the sadness\u2026</p>\n<p>It all comes crashing down on him.</p>\n<p>He\u2019d been alone for <em>three weeks. </em>Three weeks without Blue, without the paladins, without\u2026 without <em>anyone</em>.</p>\n<p>He\u2019d been alone, and he\u2019d missed his families, and he\u2019d prayed to see their faces just one more time, just\u2026 just one more time\u2026</p>\n<p>And here they are. His prayers have been answered.</p>\n<p>The smile drops off his face, replaced by the immediate trembling of his lips.</p>\n<p>\u201cLance,\u201d Shiro gently calls, placing a hand on Lance\u2019s cheek. The others have quieted now. \u201cLance, you\u2019re alright. You\u2019ll be alright.\u201d</p>\n<p>A sob shakes him, and Lance tries to shove it back, he really does, before it sounds.</p>\n<p>Another follows, then another. They grow louder, blending in together, and tears begin to cloud his vision.</p>\n<p>He thought he\u2019d never see them again.</p>\n<p>Shiro pulls him in for a tight embrace, placing his human hand on the back of Lance\u2019s head. \u201cYou\u2019re alright, you\u2019re alright,\u201d he soothes. \u201cYou\u2019ll be alright, Lance.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lance\u2019s body continues to shake with sobs, and they sound <em>heart wrenching</em>. Hunk wipes at his eyes, wiping at the tears that fall at the sight of his friend. Pidge sobs softly, hugging Lance\u2019s side. Keith has to bite his lip to stop his own sob from forming.</p>\n<p>Three weeks. Three weeks since they\u2019d last seen the blue pilot.</p>\n<p>Three weeks since Keith had told him to return home. Since Keith had told him he would not be needed in the team.</p>\n<p>One of Lance\u2019s hands drops its grip on the blanket, and clutches onto Shiro\u2019s shirt instead. A part of him wants him to pull it together, to stop being so <em>weak</em> in front of the team, to laugh it off and tease them about finding him so late.</p>\n<p>But he doesn\u2019t have the energy for that.</p>\n<p>So he lets himself cry, and he lets Shiro hold him.</p>\n<p>\u201cI was so cold,\u201d he sobs, voice muffled by Shiro\u2019s shoulder. \u201cI was so cold.\u201d</p>\n<p>Shiro shudders. \u201cIt\u2019s a cold planet. I\u2019m sorry we couldn\u2019t find you sooner, Lance\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBlue left me,\u201d Lance continues. \u201cShe wouldn\u2019t wake up. I was so cold.\u201d</p>\n<p>Keith turns around, exhaling sharply, and allows a few tears to escape. Lance had been alone, and Blue had been powered down, <em>entirely</em>.</p>\n<p>\u201cThought I\u2019d never see you,\u201d Lance mumbles, another sob making its way through the sentence. \u201cLied. You\u2019re my family. You\u2019re all my family. Don\u2019t want to leave you. I thought I\u2019d never see you again.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHey, you\u2019re right,\u201d Pidge gently says. \u201cWe are your family. And we\u2026 we really wanted to bring you back. We\u2019re so sorry, Lance, we didn\u2019t\u2013\u2013we didn\u2019t want you to stay out here. I swear, as soon as we saw the signal, we rushed over here. We were so worried about you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean what I said, before you left,\u201d Keith then adds, stepping closer. He sniffs. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I wanted to apologize, but this all happened.\u201d His voice is weaker, softer, than usual. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean it. You\u2019re part of the team. I don\u2019t want you to leave. We all missed you, and we were worried shitless. You\u2019re\u2026 You\u2019re my family, too, all of you. I\u2019m sorry I wasn\u2019t a good brother.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lance doesn\u2019t answer, but Shiro can feel his breathing slowly begin to relax.</p>\n<p>Then, \u201cI was so cold.\u201d</p>\n<p>The paladins exchange worried glances. Shiro then brings up the blanket again, wrapping it \u00a0tighter around Lance. \u201cThen let\u2019s get you someplace warmer, yeah? You guys focus on bringing back Blue. I\u2019ll take Lance with me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cS\u2019 cold out,\u201d Lance argues.</p>\n<p>\u201cJust for a bit. Then we\u2019ll get to Black, and you\u2019ll get warmer. I promise.\u201d He begins to walk towards the exit, then notes the way Lance is wobbling. \u201cLance, can you walk?\u201d</p>\n<p>Lance sniffles, and shakes his head. He rubs at his eyes, and wipes away some of the tears trailing down his cheeks. \u201cMy ankle hurts.\u201d And he\u2019s fatigued. And he\u2019s hungry. And cold.</p>\n<p>\u201cPiggy back ride!\u201d Hunk exclaims. \u201cCome on, Lance. You can stay warm if you wrap your arms around my neck!\u201d</p>\n<p>Lance\u2019s lip is still quivering, but he nods. Keith helps him climb onto Hunk\u2019s back, and Lance thanks him quietly, curling further into the blanket wrapped around him. Once they climb onto Black, and Hunk settles Lance onto the mattress/bench at the back, Shiro urges the blue paladin to rest. \u201cYou look like you need some serious rest,\u201d he notes. \u201cAnd a lot of Hunk\u2019s cooking.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lance attempts to crack a weak smile, nodding and sniffling.</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry. You\u2019re safe now, okay? You're home.\"</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>"
