  "text": "<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Shen Qingqiu had always done his best for his disciples.</p>\n<p>Always, he tempered the harsh words of his predecessor with a gentle hand, or a healing stream of qi, or guidance towards improvement. By nature, he\u2019s always been exacting and opinionated, and he\u2019s prone to fits of anxiety, and maybe those traits don\u2019t make him the best of teachers\u2026 But he\u2019d done his best anyway. He\u2019d made a real effort, beyond any he\u2019d ever made in his previous life, to do <em> right </em>by those given into his care.</p>\n<p>So it hurt more than he\u2019d expected, when his trial \u201crevealed\u201d among his other crimes the prolonged and consistent abuse of his younger disciples.</p>\n<p>He\u2019d <em> never. </em></p>\n<p>The charge was forwarded by Luo Binghe.</p>\n<p>Ming Fan and Ning Yingying had offered up vigorous and tearful arguments in their Shizun\u2019s defense, respectively.</p>\n<p>Ming Fan, old for his years and wise to the ways of failure, had known the trial was a lost cause from the start. He\u2019d stood and spoken anyway, all clenched fists and bitten off words in the face of a powerful shidi who had, to his mind, taken all his Shizun\u2019s love and care and favor and then betrayed it. It made Shen Qingqiu\u2019s heart ache to watch this young man, once destined for a petty life and an even pettier death, conduct himself with such dignity.</p>\n<p>Ning Yingying would have grown into a caring young woman even without Shen Qingqiu\u2019s influence, but the shrinking Ning Yingying in &lt;&lt;Proud Immortal Demon Way&gt;&gt; had never once stood up to her A-Luo. This Ning Yingying did, wailing noisome and sincere, \u201cHow could you, A-Luo, say such lies about our Shizun?\u201d</p>\n<p>They\u2019d both grown so well. Shen Qingqiu hadn\u2019t been a terrible teacher to <em> all </em>his disciples, at least.</p>\n<p>The Huan Hua Palace Master had argued for Shen Qingqiu\u2019s execution. Yue Qingyuan had threatened a sect war. Liu Qingge nearly provoked it.</p>\n<p>And then Luo Binghe had stepped forward and offered a <em> compromise. </em></p>\n<p>Weeks later, Shen Qingqiu, after enduring his trial, is placed into Luo Binghe\u2019s custody at Huan Hua Palace.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s raining over the palace courtyard, and Shen Qingqiu poses artfully beneath a waxed-and-oiled paper umbrella with as much mournful hauteur as he can manage. He is nothing if not adept at maintaining appearances, and in this moment \u2013 perched gracefully on the rain-swept stones, with the imperious tilt of his chin softened by moody skies and morning mist curling out of the fish ponds \u2013 Shen Qingqiu is the very picture of a proud and tragic exile.</p>\n<p>\u2018Tragic\u2019 is the goal, of course, when Luo Binghe is watching.</p>\n<p>And Luo Binghe <em> is </em>watching.</p>\n<p>Shen Qingqiu can tell, even with his qi bound to a truly shameful state. Luo Binghe\u2019s gaze feels like a shiver up the back of Shen Qingqiu\u2019s neck, as though someone hovered their fingers just above the fine hairs there, on the cusp of touching but not doing so yet.</p>\n<p>What does he see, Shen Qingqiu wonders?</p>\n<p>He is no longer permitted to wear the pale spring green of his Qing Jing Peak. The dressing room within his well-appointed suite contains many fine sets of clothing, and only one that resembles the uniform he\u2019s accustomed to. It\u2019s in a skimming cut that makes Shen Qingqiu seem\u2026 diminished. Shen Qingqiu wears it anyway, most days, over and over again, like an anxious habit.</p>\n<p>He must ask permission to read cultivation manuals. He\u2019s incapable of making the smallest of purchases. Even the lowest disciple of Huan Hua Palace stares and whispers in shameless disrespect to the disgraced former Peak Lord. His reputation is ruined. He is stripped of all titles. His qi is largely bound.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s a pitiable and tragic existence.</p>\n<p>Luo Binghe is still watching.</p>\n<p>Shen Qingqiu is far less scummy than his predecessor. Surely, he could skip the torture and dismemberment, and end his character arc as a disgraced prisoner instead? Surely, Luo Binghe could be content with his misery, with Shen Qingqiu merely ending his days in despair and captivity?</p>\n<p>Surely, to survive, Shen Qingqiu just has to look miserable enough?</p>\n<p>Shen Qingqiu doesn\u2019t turn when Luo Binghe finally stops lurking and carefully steps into his field of view. He takes in with a glance Luo Binghe\u2019s clean and bright face, the carefully arranged hair, the fine fabric and tasteful simplicity of his disciple\u2019s somber attire. Luo Binghe\u2019s daily appearance was a carefully tailored message. <em> Look at what I have become, what I have done with what you taught me! Look at how far I have risen from the child I once was! </em></p>\n<p>\u201c...Good morning, Shizun.\u201d</p>\n<p>\n<em> Good morning, Shizun! </em>\n</p>\n<p>Shen Qingqiu\u2019s heart twinges with fond memory for only a moment before he suppresses the sentiment. He can\u2019t afford to let his fond memories of that sticky lotus child cloud his thoughts. He killed that child. Shen Qingqiu had taken that trusting, naive, adorable sheep of a young man, raised him with his own two hands, and then had ruthlessly stabbed him near the heart. Shen Qingqiu had cut into him and then thrown him into a pit, into years of pain and struggle, all to save his own hide \u2013</p>\n<p>This Luo Binghe is no longer his white lotus of Qing Jing Peak. This is a different Luo Binghe entirely. This Luo Binghe is the blackened protagonist of &lt;&lt;Proud Immortal Demon Way,&gt;&gt; the Luo Binghe who, in his novel, tortured the scum villain Shen Qingqiu to death in the Huan Hua Palace\u2019s Water Prison.</p>\n<p>\u2026But things in the current timeline were drastically changed! All but one of his three crimes were false, and he was entirely ignorant of the full story behind Qiu Haitang. Surely, Binghe\u2019s betrayal isn\u2019t sufficient cause to dismember a man?</p>\n<p>Surely.</p>\n<p>\u201c...Shizun?\u201d</p>\n<p>Shen Qingqiu feels a wretched twist of fear in his chest, a high-pitched panic gibbering in his head a disgusting refrain, <em> he\u2019s going to gouge out your eyes and cut out your tongue and tear off your limbs one by one </em>\u2013</p>\n<p>He forces his posture to settle. It takes every ounce of this body\u2019s considerable dignity. Ridiculous! Circumstances could be worse. At least all of his artful, sorrowful self-arrangement in the rain had an audience, after all. He needs to think quickly, to summon up an appropriate amount of despair and angst. Something that says this teacher is sufficiently punished; no need to rip off any limbs.</p>\n<p>What would convince Luo Binghe that he\u2019s miserable?</p>\n<p>\u201cThis one is surprised to still be called Shizun,\u201d Shen Qingqiu says slowly, \u201cWhen I am no longer a Peak Lord of Cang Qiong Mountain Sect.\u201d The words taste strange coming out of his mouth; a sentence which doesn\u2019t begin with the polite \u2018this teacher.\u2019 \u201cI can no longer claim any tie to Qing Jing Peak. My name is a stain upon Cang Qiong Mountain Sect\u2019s face.\u201d That sentence tastes even worse.</p>\n<p>Shen Qingqiu braces himself before looking back over.</p>\n<p>Luo Binghe, protagonist of &lt;&lt;Proud Immortal Demon Way,&gt;&gt; is a wolf, and it hurts Shen Qingqiu\u2019s heart to look over at him and see him wearing the face of his purest and most warm-hearted sheep of a disciple.</p>\n<p>Shen Qingqiu looks back to the clouds. Luo Binghe says nothing.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd I can no longer claim the title of Shizun with any of my former disciples.\u201d</p>\n<p>...And ah, that really is sad, isn\u2019t it? His voice had gotten a bit thick there, all on its own.</p>\n<p>Truly, his acting is improved.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s not\u2026 <em> No, </em> you\u2019re <em> Shizun </em>\u2013\u201d</p>\n<p>Luo Binghe had been standing closer than he\u2019d thought, and Shen Qingqiu can marshal his composure just enough to keep his umbrella steady in a white-knuckled grip \u2013 but then Luo Binghe reaches towards him.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s too sudden a movement.</p>\n<p>To anyone who isn\u2019t a cultivator, it would seem little more than a twitch. They\u2019re both cultivators, though, and one of them is utterly OP. It\u2019s undeniable to both of them when Shen Qingqiu bodily flinches away, complete with a nervous inhalation and a thinning of lips.</p>\n<p>Luo Binghe surely knows what fear looks like \u2013 what it looks like when someone fears him.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a flash of sticky sheep unhappiness on Luo Binghe\u2019s face, and Shen Qingqiu\u2019s first instinct is to offer comfort.</p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t.</p>\n<p>System: &lt;&lt;...The protagonist loses -100 coolness points!&gt;&gt;</p>\n<p>This time, when Shen Qingqiu spins on his heel \u2013 all tense shoulders, white knuckles, and an oh-so-carefully measured pace \u2013 this time, Luo Binghe lets him walk away.</p>\n<p>It isn\u2019t as though Shen Qingqiu can go very far.</p>\n<p>-</p>\n<p>Three days later, as Shen Qingqiu returns to his rooms following an evening walk, Luo Binghe is waiting for him outside the door of his suite.</p>\n<p>Shen Qingqiu stops a careful number of steps away, forcing himself to be still. Luo Binghe might have some idea now that his old Shizun fears him (and Shen Qingqiu, in a moment of ruthless pragmatism, had briefly considered if this might benefit him), but he has played the lofty immortal too long to cower.</p>\n<p>Shen Qingqiu expects Luo Binghe to close the distance between them, as usual. Yet, Luo Binghe instead stays where he is.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s a noticeable departure from his normal behavior. Normally he\u2019d not hesitate to sidle closer to Shen Qingqiu, breathing on his ear and in his hair, offering smiles from short distances. Shen Qingqiu could hardly fail to notice the teasing glances Luo Binghe made, subtle reminders of his power over him, Shen Qingqiu\u2019s inability to stop him, the inadvisability of protest. This time, though, Luo Binghe keeps his distance. He sways oddly back and forth, as though holding himself from something. His hands are clenched around a scroll.</p>\n<p>\u201cGood evening, Shizun\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>Shen Qingqiu doesn\u2019t reply.</p>\n<p>\u201c...I received a letter, Shizun.\u201d Luo Binghe\u2019s eyes are deep black, without a trace of the demonic in them, as good a sign as any. \u201cFrom Liu-shishu. He says you need... treatment.\u201d</p>\n<p>Ah, Liu-shidi.</p>\n<p>Liu Qingge had been banned from Huan Hua Palace for the uproar he\u2019d raised both during and after Shen Qingqiu\u2019s trial. Shen Qingqiu had been flattered and heartened at the time. Unfortunately, Liu Qingge\u2019s ban had left Shen Qingqiu in something of a bind when Without A Cure began to build up in his system again. He wasn\u2019t permitted casual contact with Cang Qiong Sect, and with Liu-shidi, no contact at all.</p>\n<p>Shen Qingqiu can\u2019t feel the poison anymore, not with his qi so restricted, but his arm twitches sporadically these days... and more recently, it had begun to go numb. He knows what\u2019s happening: the poison had once more begun to clog his meridians and eat away at his qi pathways, a process which would eventually starve his body of vital qi, first crippling and then killing him.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s been months since his last treatment. He can\u2019t clear his own meridians, and his knowledge of Huan Hua Palace\u2019s disciples is limited. He doesn\u2019t know who to approach that would be both willing and equal to the task.</p>\n<p>Luo Binghe, it went without saying, hadn\u2019t been considered as an option.</p>\n<p>But now Luo Binghe is standing in front of him, staring intensely, trying to say something with his eyes in the way that novel protagonists frequently do. \u201cShizun, it doesn\u2019t sound like it\u2019ll take long. I can treat you, and then, we can have the evening meal and tea together? Or\u2026 just tea?\u201d</p>\n<p>Shen Qingqiu continues to level a cool gaze at his former disciple.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis disciple knows that Shizun hasn\u2019t been eating well lately,\u201d Luo Binghe blurts out, his tone less perfectly modulated, a little less wolf, a little more sheep, \u201cAnd Shizun isn\u2019t in a condition to practice inedia.\u201d</p>\n<p>Shen Qingqiu isn\u2019t <em> in a condition</em>. Inside, Shen Qingqiu\u2019s nearly spitting. What is with those innocent words combined with that innocent face? That comment, was Luo Binghe referring to his poisoning with Without A Cure, or the fact that Shen Qingqiu\u2019s qi is bound and unable to perform even basic cultivation skills like fasting? A bold statement from Luo Binghe, given that Luo Binghe was a primary cause for both conditions.</p>\n<p>Without access to his own spiritual energy, entirely vulnerable to attack, yet Luo Binghe wants permission to toy with his twice-crippled qi? Is Shen Qingqiu supposed to be grateful? The idea is insulting, when both parties are perfectly aware that Luo Binghe doesn\u2019t really need permission to do anything of the sort.</p>\n<p>Briefly, and again, he wonders what his former disciple sees when he looks at Shen Qingqiu now, unable to fly, once more subject to mortal needs. Triumph, maybe? Satisfaction, that his old Shizun, standing in the hall as a much diminished version of his old self, has been reduced to a perfectly refined and effectively useless human being?</p>\n<p>Shen Qingqiu will at least admit that, in this moment, Luo Binghe doesn\u2019t look particularly triumphant. He looks like he wants Shen Qingqiu to pat him on the head and tell him how well he\u2019s doing.</p>\n<p>Shen Qingqiu shakes himself loose of the nostalgia and beats his sentimental heart back into submission.</p>\n<p>In any case, he has zero interest in allowing Luo Binghe to further dictate anything involving his qi or his meridians. He also has zero interest in sharing a meal with Luo Binghe, no matter how delicious. It\u2019s true that his appetite isn\u2019t what it used to be \u2013 like so many other things \u2013 but the stress of proximity to his captor and potential torturer probably won\u2019t help.</p>\n<p>And yet, there are other considerations. Disregarding Shen Qingqiu\u2019s instinctive preferences, it\u2019s been three days since he last saw Luo Binghe. For Shen Qingqiu\u2019s plan to work, he needs to give Luo Binghe a chance to see his former Shizun\u2019s angst and woe.</p>\n<p>On top of that, Luo Binghe is being civil \u2013 or he\u2019s pretending to be civil, which amounts to much the same thing. It would reflect poorly on Shen Qingqiu\u2019s character if he doesn\u2019t respond in kind.</p>\n<p>With all of this in mind, Shen Qingqiu gives Binghe a solemn nod of his head, accepting the invitation.</p>\n<p>Binghe straightens, showing his perfect teeth with a bright and wavering smile at Shen Qingqiu.</p>\n<p>The tea room Binghe guides them to is opulent. The gilded and painted wood is fitting for the wealthiest sect, but the size, location, and private courtyard indicate that this room isn\u2019t intended for guest use. It\u2019s also been arranged ahead of time, Shen Qingqiu notices, trying not to consider the possible implications of privacy and forethought. He settles himself with as much regal grace as he can manage, snapping open his fan with a crack in an effort to hide his unease.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s unlikely that Luo Binghe will take the opportunity to sabotage his spiritual pathways, if only because Luo Binghe wants Shen Qingqiu to suffer. For that, he needs Shen Qingqiu alive. Shen Qingqiu only closes his eyes for a few brief moments before offering his other wrist to the former disciple kneeling beside him.</p>\n<p>Luo Binghe\u2019s grip is careful as his thumb presses into the tendons of Shen Qingqiu\u2019s forearm, making his hand twitch.</p>\n<p>The room is quiet. If it were Qing Jing Peak, the wind outside would rustle pleasantly in the bamboo leaves. Here, it is a tense whistle over the walls of the small courtyard.</p>\n<p>\u201c...Shizun should know that the damage is more extensive than this disciple believed it would be\u2026\u201d Luo Binghe is frowning, eyes distant as he concentrates on his spiritual senses. \u201cBut... Shizun shouldn\u2019t worry, this disciple can fix it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Shen Qingqiu can no longer feel his meridians, not exactly, not with his qi so suppressed. Still, Shen Qingqiu feels \u2013 something. More awake and alert, in sudden leaps and starts \u2013 likely with each meridian Luo Binghe clears. His arm feels lighter and more free, making him realize just how heavy and stiff it had been getting over time.</p>\n<p>He sacrifices a small measure of hauteur to curl his fingers into a fist and then relax it, testing. The gesture flexes his forearm in the circle of Luo Binghe\u2019s fingers.</p>\n<p>Luo Binghe bites his lip, a nervous habit that only emphasizes how full they are. He\u2019s no longer passing spiritual energy but is still leaning over Shen Qingqiu\u2019s wrist. \u00a0\u201c...Shizun,\u201d he asks quietly, peering up at him. \u201cShizun knows he didn\u2019t have to\u2026 Shizun of course knows that... Shizun could have asked this disciple to assist before now?\u201d Luo Binghe\u2019s eyes plead.</p>\n<p>\u201c...Yes,\u201d Shen Qingqiu admits. <em> But I chose not to</em>, goes unsaid.</p>\n<p>Luo Binghe stares at him. His grip tightens very slightly, applying just enough pressure on Shen Qingqiu's delicate tendons to make his hand twitch again.</p>\n<p>System: &lt;&lt;...The protagonist loses -100 coolness points!&gt;&gt;</p>\n<p>Shen Qingqiu can\u2019t help a frustrated exhalation, pulling his wrist from Luo Binghe. They both know that Luo Binghe is strong enough to hold Shen Qingqiu in place if he chooses.</p>\n<p>Luo Binghe lets him withdraw. Then, he closes his eyes, and takes a deep, steadying breath. Then, he busies himself with the table, fussing with the arrangement in a way Shen Qingqiu recognizes from a younger, gentler, less lethal version of the man sitting with him, focused and perfectionist, each item being placed just so.</p>\n<p>Then, Luo Binghe pours the tea, and he glances up at Shen Qingqiu through the side of his lashes.</p>\n<p>And ah, Shen Qingqiu thinks, because Shen Qingqiu recognizes that look.</p>\n<p>Luo Binghe is by necessity a good actor, sly and talented, passionate in his delivery. Hadn\u2019t he demonstrated his mastery of this skillset at Shen Qingqiu\u2019s trial? In the original &lt;&lt;Proud Immortal Demon Way&gt;&gt;, he\u2019d wielded deception as capably as he\u2019d wielded Xin Mo \u2013 no one had been able to discern his falsehoods from his truths. But it\u2019s possible that this Luo Binghe is less practiced, having spent less time in the Abyss. It\u2019s equally possible that this version of Shen Qingqiu had always paid closer attention to his favored disciple.</p>\n<p>Because Shen Qingqiu recognizes that look: it\u2019s the same look that his white lotus Binghe had worn whenever he was about to show off. It is the look he wore when he believed himself to be terribly clever.</p>\n<p>Ah, Shen Qingqiu thinks. He\u2019s done something to the tea.</p>\n<p>Shen Qingqiu doesn\u2019t bother to hide this foresight, after the tea is poured. He tilts his cup towards the light to better see the color, appearing a pale and fragrant peach tea to all of his senses save intuition. Luo Binghe doesn\u2019t, quite, wilt.</p>\n<p>Shen Qingqiu lowers his lashes, and on a less imperious man, the effect might be termed coy.</p>\n<p>\u201cDid Binghe poison this one\u2019s tea?\u201d Shen Qingqiu asks politely.</p>\n<p>Luo Binghe pales, and then his face twists in frustration.</p>\n<p>The Luo Binghe sitting across from him isn\u2019t his young and pure lotus Binghe.</p>\n<p>Shen Qingqiu had taken that warm and pure and wholesome sheep boy, that young disciple who he\u2019d watched and raised for many years, and he\u2019d willfully tossed him into the Endless Abyss and all the horrors within. While Shen Qingqiu had known that some version of Luo Binghe would survive \u2013 the protagonist, the proud immortal demon, the <em> wolf </em>\u2013 he\u2019d also known that he\u2019d never see the white lotus child Binghe ever again.</p>\n<p>No wonder he transmigrated as the scum villain.</p>\n<p>This Luo Binghe isn\u2019t Shen Qingqiu\u2019s beloved sheep Binghe anymore \u2013</p>\n<p>\u2013 and Shen Qingqiu is no longer anyone\u2019s Shizun, with all his careful years of raising Ming Fan and Ning Yingying <em> and Luo Binghe </em>amounting to only a stain on their talents and names \u2013</p>\n<p>\u2013 and Shen Qingqiu is no longer permitted his Qing Jing Peak; it\u2019s unlikely he\u2019ll ever see Qing Jing Peak again \u2013</p>\n<p>\u2013 and he misses Airplane Bro and Liu-shidi and Zhangmen-shixiong \u2013</p>\n<p>\u2013 and every day is an exercise in fear \u2013</p>\n<p>\u2013 and Shen Qingqiu has been so busy pretending to be miserable that <em> he has ignored how miserable he actually is </em>\u2013</p>\n<p>\n<em> \u2013 and he downs the tainted tea in one go. </em>\n</p>\n<p>Luo Binghe stares at him from across the table, a wolf wielding sheep eyes and sheep tears and a wounded, wavering voice.</p>\n<p>\u201cShizun\u2026?\u201d</p>\n<p>System: &lt;&lt;...The protagonist loses -200 coolness points!&gt;&gt;</p>\n<p>The trees beyond the courtyard walls start to hiss in the wind, and for a moment, Shen Qingqiu pretends that it\u2019s bamboo.</p>\n<p>-</p>\n<p>Shen Qingqiu wakes up staring at the ceiling of his bamboo house on his Qing Jing Peak.</p>\n<p>The sight of it is a forced blow to his heart. For a moment, he allows himself to imagine that everything leading to this point has all been a terrible nightmare, and then he closes his eyes again.</p>\n<p>System! The responding pop-up window was glaring on the back of his eyelids. System, where am I?!</p>\n<p>System: &lt;&lt;Huan Hua Palace, East Wing.&gt;&gt;</p>\n<p>Shen Qingqiu breathes deeply, and reconciles the familiar mountain scents with the fact that, despite what his senses tell him, he\u2019s still in a Huan Hua Palace tea room. He\u2019s not on Qing Jing Peak. This is an illusion, a dream.</p>\n<p>And he\u2019s in this dream because Luo Binghe decided to <em> drug </em> him with one of Airplane Bro\u2019s dozens of <em> ridiculous </em>plot device teas.</p>\n<p>Shen Qingqiu opens his eyes again. This illusory Qing Jing Peak bamboo house looks exactly as he\u2019d left the real one. One of his fans is even askew on the floor by the bed. He picks it up, recognizing it: an old favorite, with tines of cedar wood and cheerful tree peonies on the silk.</p>\n<p>The dream tea has crafted a thorough illusion. If the System hadn\u2019t verified, Shen Qingqiu might have begun to believe it was real.</p>\n<p>The question, then, is exactly which one of Airplane Bro\u2019s seemingly endless plot device dream teas <em> is </em>this? There were many, and each is less probable than the last.</p>\n<p>There was a tea which made the drinker relive their greatest regret, a possibility. There was a tea which allowed the drinker to commune with the dead, recreating a favorite place of the deceased. Less likely. There was a tea which allowed the drinker to dream what made them happiest, which in the novel, was usually papapa with Luo Binghe. Hah.</p>\n<p>There were <em> dozens </em>of aphrodisiac teas.</p>\n<p>...Useless. Shen Qingqiu clutches his illusory fan. How is he supposed to figure things out when even Airplane Bro can\u2019t remember all the useless crap he\u2019d written into his shitty novel?</p>\n<p>\u201cShizun!\u201d</p>\n<p>Shen Qingqiu, free hand buried in his hair, feels his breath catch in fear. When he looks over, his breath catches for another reason entirely.</p>\n<p>Because the Luo Binghe in the door is a white and precious thing.</p>\n<p>The Luo Binghe standing by the doorframe wears white. White, with the trim and tassels in the pale greens of Qing Jing Peak. His hair, instead of Luo Binghe\u2019s usual luxuriously riotous tangle, is pulled back into a less-than-perfect ponytail \u2013 the young white lotus Binghe had never gotten the hang of handling his hair; Shen Qingqiu had diligently fixed his student\u2019s ponytail every morning for years.</p>\n<p>His fear evaporates in shock.</p>\n<p>Shen Qingqiu stares.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s his white lotus Binghe, but\u2026 an adult.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s just as tall and broad as the adult Luo Binghe who has him in captivity, and there\u2019s a demon mark on his forehead. Broad shoulders, long legs. This Binghe has the age and stature and glowing red demon mark of the novel\u2019s peerlessly attractive protagonist Luo Binghe... but is dressed in white, carries <em> Zheng Yang </em>on his back, and wears the same brilliant and delighted smile that had always been his Binghe\u2019s habit when greeting his Shizun.</p>\n<p>The adult lotus Binghe balances a tray of food on his hip. \u201cI made Shizun\u2019s favorite congee!\u201d</p>\n<p>Shen Qingqiu stares more.</p>\n<p>This is a dream. A tea-induced dream, but a dream.</p>\n<p>But then, Luo Binghe is a master of dreams.</p>\n<p>Shen Qingqiu presses the guard of his fan to his lips, breathing in the smell of cedar, not taking his eyes off of the Binghe by the door. Is this Luo Binghe? Is this some kind of scheme to toy with Shen Qingqiu?</p>\n<p>The Luo Binghe of the waking world, the Luo Binghe who\u2019d ensured Shen Qingqiu\u2019s captivity, the Luo Binghe who\u2019d poured his treacherous Shizun a cup of cursed tea, was almost fastidious in his appearance. He\u2019d never appeared in front of Shen Qingqiu with anything other than clean and bright skin, artfully tousled hair, a measured countenance, and well-tended and pressed robes.</p>\n<p>The Binghe in front of him was familiar in his charming frazzle, the kitchen soot smudged on his sleeves, the unrestrained eagerness. His hair was charmingly askew. The real, newly prideful Luo Binghe wouldn\u2019t allow himself to be seen like this. This must be Shen Qingqiu\u2019s projection of him. This illusory Binghe is part of the illusion.</p>\n<p>Shen Qingqiu stares even more at this dream version of adult Luo Binghe, wearing the colors of his Qing Jing Peak, once again an eager and loyal student, delivering breakfast, all white lotus looks and starry eyes and fluffy hair and broad shoulders \u2013</p>\n<p>Shen Qingqiu hears a strange noise.</p>\n<p>The illusory Binghe cocks his head to the right like a confused puppy; a lock of unruly hair escapes his ponytail and flops over his mature, refined face.</p>\n<p>Shen Qingqiu hears the noise again, then realizes it came from his own increasingly dry throat.</p>\n<p>\u201c...Does Shizun not want congee...?\u201d</p>\n<p>Illusory Binghe is beginning to fret, slowly setting down the tray on the table, and Shen Qingqiu is nothing if not adaptable. Well, then.</p>\n<p>\u201c...Binghe.\u201d Shen Qingqiu croaks, before clearing his throat. \u201cThis teacher is grateful for his dutiful disciple.\u201d</p>\n<p>He moves with as much grace as he can, given circumstances, sitting up all the way and swinging his feet to the floor.</p>\n<p>This isn\u2019t the Luo Binghe of the waking world. This version of Luo Binghe doesn\u2019t know the taste of betrayal; this is a Binghe that hasn\u2019t fallen prey to the selfish actions of Shen Qingqiu.</p>\n<p>\u201cBut why is this dutiful disciple\u2019s hair so messy?\u201d he directs. \u201cSit, this Shizun will fix it.\u201d</p>\n<p>There\u2019s nothing keeping Shen Qingqiu\u2019s shamefully sentimental heart from doting on <em> this </em>Binghe.</p>\n<p>Illusory Binghe had apparently prepared for this and drops bonelessly to the ground in front of Shen Qingqiu, brandishing a comb, as obedient and eager for anything approaching affection as the sticky child and then teenager had been. Shen Qingqiu takes the comb and gets to work, taking his time.</p>\n<p>Ah, even though he\u2019s patterned off of an adult version whose hair he\u2019s not touched, this Binghe\u2019s hair is as fluffy and delightful as Shen Qingqiu remembers. Illusory Binghe has even more hair to manage than the Binghe he remembers raising.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis teacher can\u2019t allow his disciple to leave in such a state,\u201d scolds Shen Qingqiu purely out of habit, belying his words with a fond tone and the careful fingers scratching fondly at the crown of Binghe\u2019s head. It\u2019s ostensibly in an effort to pull the hair back. \u201cIs my Qing Jing Peak so neglectful of its disciples?\u201d</p>\n<p>Illusory Binghe, like sheep Binghe had often done, tries and fails to be subtle about pressing his head into his Shizun\u2019s hands.</p>\n<p>The real Luo Binghe is a master of dreams, and he is watching, Shen Qingqiu knows.</p>\n<p>What must the real Luo Binghe think of this tableau, as he watches? A treacherous and hated Shizun, showing these small kindnesses to a dream projection that wears his face and name?</p>\n<p>Luo Binghe wanted Shen Qingqiu to drink that tea for a reason, though the exact reason remained a mystery. Whatever the tea is supposed to reveal or present, whether these projections are created by Shen Qingqiu\u2019s unconscious mind, or deliberately manufactured and placed there by the tea, there\u2019s no doubt in Shen Qingqiu\u2019s mind. The Luo Binghe of the waking world still has an eye on him.</p>\n<p>Shen Qingqiu can feel it, that telltale prickle on the back of his neck.</p>\n<p>That\u2019s\u2026 fine. Nothing to be done about it. Shen Qingqiu might not know the manner or the purpose of this illusion, but apparently, for the duration of it, he gets to have... this.</p>\n<p>He digs his nails soothingly into illusory Binghe\u2019s scalp. Illusory Binghe visibly shivers in delight, and Shen Qingqiu doesn\u2019t particularly care if right now if the real Luo Binghe can see it.</p>\n<p>Shen Qingqiu\u2019s going to take advantage of having this for as long as this dream lasts.</p>\n<p>He eventually gathers up illusory Binghe\u2019s hair into something proper \u2013 always a challenge given the texture \u2013 and secures it with a long pale green ribbon. He ties it into a broad-looped bow which, on anyone else less potently male than a mature Luo Binghe, would look positively maidenly. Shen Qingqiu delights in it and gives Binghe a few last fond head pats. Ah! Binghe, more like Bingmei!</p>\n<p>Illusory Binghe pats his new bow gingerly, as though he\u2019s afraid to ruin it, and Shen Qingqiu absolutely does not coo. Is this illusion supposed to reveal his poor treatment of Luo Binghe? \u00a0It was true that the original goods had been cruel and abusive, something that the current and improved Shen Qingqiu had put a stop to as soon as he was able. Is that what the real Luo Binghe hopes to gather evidence of?</p>\n<p>He\u2019s out of luck, if that\u2019s the case. Shen Qingqiu had always adored Luo Binghe \u2013 he\u2019d had the luxury of that, back when he\u2019d still been assured that Luo Binghe could not and had no real reason to dismember his teacher.</p>\n<p>This is only a tea dream. It could \u2013 it will \u2013 end any minute. Yet, it seems a beautiful and peaceful morning on Qing Jing Peak. The bamboo leaves rustle, the birds are singing, the wind chimes sound softly in the distance, and Binghe hums contentedly under his palm.</p>\n<p>Shen Qingqiu couldn\u2019t have asked for a better dream.</p>\n<p>Shen Qingqiu is going to make the most of this.</p>\n<p>-</p>\n<p>For years now, Shen Qingqiu\u2019s life has been one of anxiety punctuated by bursts of terror. Shen Qingqiu\u2019s life since Luo Binghe\u2019s return from the Abyss has been one of terror punctuated by bursts of anxiety. He has found himself absorbed in what he <em> doesn\u2019t </em> want \u2013 pain, mutilation, death \u2013 because what he <em> does </em>want hasn\u2019t mattered.</p>\n<p>But something about the dream makes it easy to let go of fear. For a calm moment, Shen Qingqiu leans all his weight back, relaxing, chin tipped up, eyes closed. Illusory Binghe\u2019s fingertips on his scalp are soothing.</p>\n<p>Shen Qingqiu sits at his desk on an Illusory Qing Jing Peak, allowing Illusory Binghe to pin his hair as he checks his schedule for the day \u2013 just as he normally might.</p>\n<p>Shen Qingqiu has never been an ambitious man. Discerning, yes. Overly concerned with appearances, also yes. But a big dreamer? No, not beyond living a peaceful existence. In his previous life, he\u2019d been largely content to remain in an apartment paid for by his parents, living vicariously through characters in his webnovels. He was complacent.</p>\n<p>In this life, he can\u2019t be. His actions have consequences. He can cause pain. In this life, the characters he\u2019d forged connections to through his screen aren\u2019t characters. They\u2019re <em> people </em>, whose lives he has changed just by existing \u2013 whose lives and happinesses he is responsible for. It\u2019s a responsibility he failed for Luo Binghe, and it makes him uncomfortable. He just wants to be, to relax and enjoy the scenery, the bamboo grove, quiet friendships. \u00a0</p>\n<p>It\u2019s a welcome comfort that his schedule lays out a perfectly normal and lovely day on Qing Jing Peak.</p>\n<p>Classes in the morning, as always. A shared afternoon meal with Liu-shidi and Zhangmen-shixiong, to discuss an upcoming night hunt. A chat with Airplane Bro.</p>\n<p>And private lessons with Binghe in the early evening.</p>\n<p>Shen Qingqiu hums, prompting Illusory Binghe to lightly press nails into Shen Qingqiu\u2019s scalp as he pulls back his Shizun\u2019s hair.</p>\n<p>Something about this dream makes it easy to let go of fear, he thinks, as he stands to greet the day.</p>\n<p>The thought should alarm him.</p>\n<p>It doesn\u2019t.</p>\n<p>Ning Yingying and Ming Fan are waiting outside.</p>\n<p>\u201cShizun!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShizun, good morning!\u201d</p>\n<p>The illusory Ming Fan, just like his real life counterpart, wears an expression simultaneously anxious and determined. The illusory Ning Yingying waves cheerily with a smile on her face. They had apparently been waiting a reasonable distance from the bamboo house, to afford their Shizun some privacy. Courteous and well-mannered, just as he\u2019d taught them.</p>\n<p>It doesn\u2019t behoove a regal Peak Lord to raise his voice unnecessarily, so Shen Qingqiu strides over to greet them, his peak robes fanning out with his approach, nodding at Ming Fan before tapping Ning Yingying on the head with his fan. \u201cThis teacher has surely taught this student more decorum.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAh, this student is sorry, Shizun!\u201d Ning Yingying tries her best to stifle her grin. The effect is comical.</p>\n<p>To be fair, Shen Qingqiu had never tried very hard to teach Ning Yingying any sense of gravitas. It didn\u2019t suit her, \u00a0in the same way that music had never suited Ming Fan. He\u2019d allowed both to focus on their strengths. Now, Luo Binghe, Ming Fan, and Ning Yingying, all three of them adults and skilled cultivators each in their own right, stood dutifully in front of him.</p>\n<p>A warm fondness blooms in Shen Qingqiu, and something small and tired in Shen Qingqiu shivers and unfurls; his shoulders relax just the slightest. He is unbearably proud of them.</p>\n<p>Given what seems a last day on Qing Jing Peak, Shen Qingqiu chooses to just experience the simple joys of it, without fear.</p>\n<p>Classes go smoothly. His disciples are well-behaved and attentive. It\u2019s ostensibly a guqin lesson, but Shen Qingqiu spends most of it indulging them with the compositions he plays best. He writes it off as a demonstration.</p>\n<p>Lunch with Zhangmen-shixiong and Liu-shidi is pleasantly familiar. Yue Qingyuan somehow exudes wise benevolence and dignity even as he frets like a fussy grandmother, making the most unlikely concerns for Shen Qingqiu\u2019s safety seem reasonable.</p>\n<p>Liu Qingge scowls at the delicious food, doesn\u2019t speak in sentences longer than five words, and looks mildly out of place in the scholarly setting of Qing Jing Peak \u2013 and yet, he firmly insists that he won\u2019t be too busy for Shen Qingqiu.</p>\n<p>Airplane Bro visits soon after. Shang Qinghua is always a certain level of exasperating, but Shen Qingqiu will admit to being reluctantly charmed by his shamelessness. At first they complain about missing the conveniences of their old lives, and light figurative candles for their old smartphones. But then Airplane admits that he only invented communication arrays because <em> he stole a lot of his plots from old TV shows </em>and he doesn\u2019t really want to have live through them.</p>\n<p>Shen Qingqiu shamelessly bullies Shang Qinghua until he flees in a flurry of babble.</p>\n<p>And then Binghe appears at his elbow, cupping his hands in a respectful bow. He smiles brightly, and Shen Qingqiu smiles back, and the sheer joy of it is a shock.</p>\n<p>He can\u2019t remember why.</p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t dare teach Binghe anything related to combat or cultivation. Binghe, a protagonist fully grown, is far too likely to surpass his teacher at this point. Instead, they sit together next to the plum tree and quiet spring to critique Binghe\u2019s literature and calligraphy.</p>\n<p>Binghe\u2019s maidenly heart has lent itself to penning pining-sweet Tang verses \u2013 <em> High mountain, how I long to reach you! </em> \u2013 which, when written in Binghe\u2019s assertive brushstrokes, take on a bolder and assured meaning. <em> Master, I hail you from my heart! </em>Binghe insists on reading the verses outloud, shyly reciting the transcriptions, eyes flitting from the written pages to Shen Qingqiu and back.</p>\n<p>A blushing and handsome protagonist, reading him such sentimental poetry under a blossoming tree \u2013 Shen Qingqiu is far too charmed by this milieu to be terribly constructive. He hides his face behind his fan and tries to contain himself. Binghe! This protagonist!</p>\n<p>Shen Qingqiu is feeling light enough to grant him with a pleased smile over his fan. Binghe\u2019s smile is no less genuine, but shines unrestrained.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s almost disappointed when they run out of copied poetry to \u201ccritique,\u201d but the timing is perfect \u2013 because to his delight, just as they return to the library pavilion, it rains. It\u2019s a clean drizzle, just enough to keep the frogs and crickets from singing. The sound of it on the bamboo leaves is a pleasant backdrop as they walk back, Shen Qingqiu allowing Binghe to hold the umbrella.</p>\n<p>They step over the threshold of the bamboo house together, where Binghe\u2019s broad shoulders keep any rain from sweeping in.</p>\n<p>Finally back in privacy, Shen Qingqiu reaches up and pulls the hairpin and crown out of his hair, shaking his head to let his hair fall free. He hears an inhalation behind him, and then Binghe is running careful fingers through it to help detangle.</p>\n<p>The rain on the roof muffles all other sound, and world is suddenly very small, standing next to an open door with Binghe\u2019s hands in his hair, a day of calm friendships just passed with only more such days to come.</p>\n<p>Shen Qingqiu hums, and permits Binghe to be inappropriately thorough. It\u2019s only the two of them, here, anyway.</p>\n<p>Although...</p>\n<p>There\u2019s something he\u2019s forgotten, isn\u2019t there? Something of great urgency.</p>\n<p>Something he should be worried about.</p>\n<p>...It can\u2019t be terribly important if he can\u2019t remember.</p>\n<p>He can just enjoy things right now, standing next to Binghe at the end of a lovely day on Qing Jing Peak, where there is nothing to be concerned about.</p>\n<p>Certainly not that prickle on the back of neck, like someone is watching, but that couldn\u2019t be it.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s no reason to be anxious at all.</p>\n<p>He looks out the door through a break in the leaves. There are no rain clouds on the horizon; the sky is painted prettily in bands of gold to pink to inky dark blue.</p>\n<p>Then Shen Qingqiu turns back to his disciple and nearly coos with delight, because ah! The humidity\u2019s sent Binghe\u2019s hair into a charming halo of frizz, catching the last of the sun\u2019s light, making it look even fluffier than usual!</p>\n<p>Shen Qingqiu wants to pat him on the head.</p>\n<p>-</p>\n<p>It\u2019s a pleasure all its own, watching Binghe bustle around the bamboo house and fuss with the various tasks he\u2019s appointed himself. Shen Qingqiu watched this routine for years; Binghe as an adult is more restrained in his movements, maturity has smoothed his youthful buoyancy.</p>\n<p>Shen Qingqiu only resists for a few seconds before indulging himself. \u201cBinghe should sit and rest with this teacher; he\u2019s done well today.\u201d</p>\n<p>Binghe preens, chin raising in pride as he dutifully arranges himself next to Shen Qingqiu. Shen Qingqiu runs his hand over Binghe\u2019s hair, and doesn\u2019t quite sigh in contentment.</p>\n<p>\u201cShizun is cheerful today,\u201d notes Binghe, bright and eager. \u201cAsking Shizun, is there a reason for his good mood?\u201d</p>\n<p>Shen Qingqiu closes his eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing specific, Binghe.\u201d Pat pat. \u201cThis teacher is just\u2026 happy, today.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c...Is Shizun not usually happy?\u201d</p>\n<p>Shen Qingqiu hums, fanning himself slowly, one hand still buried in Binghe\u2019s hair. \u201cHere is where this teacher is most content.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c...Content isn\u2019t happy, Shizun.\u201d</p>\n<p>Shen Qingqiu pauses his absentminded petting.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the difference?\u201d He asks, looking at his student with a mild expression. \u201cThis teacher is happy to see his students improve, but they will necessarily fail, often. This teacher is happy to watch the spring rains, but the seasons must cycle each year. This teacher is happy to aid his martial siblings, but they won\u2019t always need me.\u201d</p>\n<p>The demon mark on Binghe\u2019s brow is crinkled in mild distress. Shen Qingqiu smoothes it with his thumb.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis teacher is also happy to return home, and see a most favored disciple waiting for him,\u201d Shen Qingqiu adds gently, and Binghe does perk up at this. \u201cBut I know you won\u2019t be here forever, Binghe.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy not, Shizun?\u201d Binghe immediately insists, voice firm. \u201cWhat if I <em> want </em>to be here forever? If that would make you happy?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Binghe.</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThis disciple is happy here with Shizun.\u201d Binghe frowns mulishly.</p>\n<p>Ah, Binghe. Shen Qingqiu\u2019s heart hurts. Shen Qingqiu had always tried to give Binghe the best things in life, but only now is Shen Qingqiu realizing how important that had been to his own happiness.</p>\n<p>Shen Qingqiu closes his fan and rests the end on Binghe\u2019s lips, pressing gently. Binghe holds his breath, his mouth lax against Shen Qingqiu\u2019s fan until Shen Qingqiu lifts it.</p>\n<p>\u201cBinghe.\u201d Shen Qingqiu says gently, \u201cTell this teacher, what would make Binghe the most happy?\u201d</p>\n<p>Binghe exhales and flushes a lovely color, high on his cheeks.</p>\n<p>Shen Qingqiu waits patiently.</p>\n<p>Binghe has been sitting very prettily up to this point. His feet are tucked under him, his shoulders are back, his spine is straight. But now, he places one hand on the floor for balance and then he shifts \u2013 one, two shuffles of his knees \u2013</p>\n<p>\u2013 and now, he\u2019s leaning in.</p>\n<p>What\u2026?</p>\n<p>Binghe is leaning in slowly, while staring into Shen Qingqiu\u2019s eyes.</p>\n<p>Shen Qingqiu feels his breath catch as the realization floods over him in a shock of cold, then burning heat.</p>\n<p>The sliding of fabric is loud in the quiet room, and Binghe\u2019s glittering eyes are huge. The eye contact is steady and dizzying; Binghe\u2019s face and Binghe\u2019s mouth are getting closer and closer to Shen Qingqiu\u2019s \u2013</p>\n<p>The greater part of him \u2013 the rational part, the anxious part \u2013 howls. <em> Binghe! You are a stallion protagonist! This teacher is a man! What kind of master-disciple relationship is this?! </em></p>\n<p>\u2026and yet.</p>\n<p>A more fragile part of Shen Qingqiu \u2013 the part which, in a previous life, had cheered to read Luo Binghe\u2019s successes and mourned all his tragedies \u2013 the part of him which suffered through a massive and poorly-written novel because honestly, he really, really liked this protagonist \u2013</p>\n<p>\u2013 the part of Shen Qingqiu which has always admired and been in awe of Luo Binghe \u2013</p>\n<p>That part of him quietly <em> thrills</em>.</p>\n<p>Luo Binghe stops with his nose a bare handspan from his Shizun\u2019s. Shen Qingqiu looks back, swallowing.</p>\n<p>Luo Binghe\u2019s appearance as described in the novel &lt;&lt;Proud Immortal Demon Way&gt;&gt; was peerless in every way. His eyes spoke passionately, he moved his body with surety and intensity. There was never a doubt that Luo Binghe was a man who could seduce 600 wives.</p>\n<p>It wasn\u2019t as though Shen Qingqiu never noticed. Fear just hadn\u2019t left the space to consider it.</p>\n<p>Shen Qingqiu can\u2019t remember what fear feels like.</p>\n<p>Binghe\u2019s eyes are starry with adoration, half-lidded with implications. His breath smells like peach tea.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis disciple\u2026 would be most happy making his Shizun most happy,\u201d Binghe murmurs. \u201cOr at least, this one would like to try.\u201d</p>\n<p>Shen Qingqiu can\u2019t breathe.</p>\n<p>To say that Binghe is attractive is a laughable understatement. He\u2019s attractive as only a protagonist could possibly be: preternaturally beautiful, abundant dark hair and shining eyes and broad shoulders, dressed now in bright lamb-white robes \u2013 and yet somehow, in this moment, touchable. Attainable.</p>\n<p>In this moment, unlike many others, Shen Qingqiu is not being cornered or pressed or coerced. Here, Binghe has offered, and now Binghe waits. Shen Qingqiu\u2019s personality resists force and fights when pushed \u2013 will <em> only </em>fight when pushed \u2013 but, in the face of gentle coaxing, he bends.</p>\n<p>In the face of Binghe?</p>\n<p>The sound of wood cracking breaks the silence. Shen Qingqiu has maintained his serene, haughty expression, but his grip has snapped several spokes of his fine cedar and silk fan.</p>\n<p>This is Luo Binghe, fiercely loyal at any age, diligent and intelligent. Sometimes clever, often stubborn, and always, always brave. This is Luo Binghe, for whom Shen Qingqiu\u2019s first instinct has always, always been to protect.</p>\n<p>Something must show on Shen Qingqiu\u2019s face, because Binghe inhales, lips parting as his eyes widen, pupils blown \u2013 Binghe gasps like a debauched maiden, and all Binghe\u2019s done is <em> look </em>at him \u2013</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a small noise. It\u2019s come from Shen Qingqiu\u2019s throat.</p>\n<p>And then Shen Qingqiu\u2019s mouth is touching Binghe\u2019s.</p>\n<p>Long seconds pass of just that, his mostly-broken fan guiding Binghe with a gentle touch under his jaw. Binghe\u2019s breathing is getting heavier nonetheless, and his big, dark, starry eyes are wide and blinking.</p>\n<p>It is\u2026 chaste. Insufficient. Then Binghe mewls, surging forward, wanting more without knowing what more even is.</p>\n<p>Shen Qingqiu doesn\u2019t count himself experienced in these matters, but he is at least more experienced than Binghe. He presses Binghe back; humming, and catches Binghe\u2019s lips between his.</p>\n<p>Binghe trembles. Shen Qingqiu kisses him. He only slides his tongue just barely between the seam of his lips \u2013 just enough to make the kiss slippery. The room is quiet enough to hear small, slick sounds between them.</p>\n<p>The kiss is a promise \u2013 brimming with affection, patient and careful. The fact that the kiss is happening at all is a promise \u2013 Shen Qingqiu is promising things to Binghe \u2013</p>\n<p>\u2013 and he wants to promise Binghe so many, many things \u2013</p>\n<p>System: &lt;&lt;...The protagonist gains +450 coolness points!&gt;&gt;</p>\n<p>Shen Qingqiu jerks back in shock. A trail of spit connects their lips. A hand remains tangled in Binghe\u2019s hair, however it had gotten there. Binghe still has his eyes shut, blindly leaning forward to follow the kiss, his lips red and swollen and wet. Shen Qingqiu jerks back again, further. Binghe opens his eyes just enough to peer at Shen Qingqiu with heavy-lidded slits, all long lashes and unshed tears.</p>\n<p>Illusory Binghe is temptation personified.</p>\n<p><em> Illusory </em>Binghe.</p>\n<p>Shen Qingqiu is already breathing heavily, and his mouth fills with saliva in a sudden and immediate bout of nausea and fear. When had he forgotten that this place isn\u2019t real? That this is nothing more than an induced dream?</p>\n<p>More to the point \u2013 When, exactly, had he forgotten that <em> the real Luo Binghe is watching? </em></p>\n<p>The real Luo Binghe, who will have either his unhappiness or his limbs?</p>\n<p>Scrambling to hide his emotional reaction \u2013 there was no way he kept all of that off his face! \u2013 Shen Qingqiu reaches forward and grabs Illusory Binghe by the base of his neck and pulls him into an awkward embrace, tucking his face into the crook of Shen Qingqiu\u2019s neck and shoulder.</p>\n<p>\u201cLet\u2019s stay like this a while,\u201d Shen Qingqiu breathes anyway. A pause, then he adjusts them for comfort, leaning against the table with Illusory Binghe practically in his lap. Illusory Binghe complies quietly, breathing deep, settling in with a contented hum, and says nothing about how tense his Shizun must feel.</p>\n<p>Like this, Shen Qingqiu quietly panics.</p>\n<p>And suddenly, Shen Qingqiu knows exactly which plot device tea he\u2019d been dosed with, because he wants \u2013 more than anything else he has ever wanted before \u2013 to <em> stay</em>.</p>\n<p>He wants to stay on his Qing Jing Peak, in his bamboo house. He wants to teach and guide his disciples. He wants to share secrets with Airplane Bro, to bicker with Liu-shidi, to be fussed over by Yue Qingyuan.</p>\n<p>He wants to stay here, with a Luo Binghe that doesn\u2019t scare him.</p>\n<p>Shen Qingqiu clings to his Illusory Binghe mindlessly, repetitively, shivering, and waits for the dream to end.</p>\n<p>-</p>\n<p>Shen Qingqiu wakes up staring at the ceiling of a tea room in Huan Hua Palace.</p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t want the dream to be over, but the dream is over anyway.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s too sudden and too soon, but he doesn\u2019t have the luxury of time to pretend he\u2019s anywhere else.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s been arranged \u2013 had he just fallen over, when the tea had taken effect? \u2013 to lounge on his back on several cushions, his long hair draped carefully over one shoulder. He\u2019s still on the floor by the low tea table, but pillows have been placed under his head and pushed up against his sides like a nest. His head doesn\u2019t quite ache, but it feels too light. He hasn\u2019t even sat up yet, and he doesn\u2019t trust his balance.</p>\n<p>His hand feels heavy as he lifts it to brush back a stray strand of hair.</p>\n<p>\u201cShizun?\u201d</p>\n<p>Shen Qingqiu is somewhat disoriented, because Binghe\u2019s voice isn\u2019t immediately terrifying \u2013 until his muddled, drugged brain manages to separate the tea dream from reality. This isn\u2019t the Binghe he\u2019d been shamefully clinging to; this is the real Luo Binghe. Powerful, self-assured, and vengeful. This Luo Binghe is a danger to Shen Qingqiu, and here, words and actions are the difference between life and death.</p>\n<p>This would be easier if his head weren\u2019t so muddled. As it is, he\u2019s not certain that he can sit up and remain sitting up, not with his senses still swimming. He chooses to stay reclined, even as the indignity of it rankles.</p>\n<p>\u201cPhoenix Thousand Joy Tea,\u201d croaks Shen Qingqiu. His voice is hoarse. \u201cA spiritual tea to grant the drinker insight into their happiness.\u201d</p>\n<p>Luo Binghe isn\u2019t quite within arms reach. He\u2019d apparently spent the dream sleeping with his head tucked into the cradle of his arms on the low table. He doesn\u2019t look tired at all, which is patently unfair, because Shen Qingqiu feels like he could sleep for a week. Where Shen Qingqiu feels exhaustion, on Luo Binghe, he only sees bewilderment.</p>\n<p>\u201c...This disciple wanted to know what makes Shizun happy,\u201d Binghe admits quietly.</p>\n<p>Shen Qingqiu wants to vomit.</p>\n<p>The tea had eroded his ability to sense that he was in a dream. Of course. He wouldn\u2019t have been terribly <em> happy </em>to remember that his every move was being watched by a man whose original destiny was to torture and kill him. Every kind touch, every soft word, every quiet moment with his favorite people had had an audience, watching with unknown purpose.</p>\n<p>Had his sentimental heart endangered the others? Had his fond tutelage of Ming Fan and Ning Yingying made targets of them? Had his commiseration with Airplane Bro brought him to Luo Binghe\u2019s attention? Had his dealings with Liu-shidi and Yue Qingyuan endangered the whole sect?</p>\n<p>And his treatment of that alternate Binghe \u2013 of course doting on that white lotus made him happy! Binghe had been a sweet, silly, naive child, and an endearing and diligent teenager \u2013 he\u2019d favored him terribly!</p>\n<p>And then \u2013</p>\n<p>In the novel &lt;&lt;Proud Immortal Demon Way,&gt;&gt; the Phoenix Thousand Joy Tea had featured multiple times. It was a cheap plot device that Airplane Bro used to convince recalcitrant harem candidates that what they really wanted, deep inside, was papapa with Luo Binghe.</p>\n<p>The damn tea had worked exactly as Airplane Bro had written \u2013 one ludicrously impossible wish-fulfillment fantasy, complete with a protagonist-centric romantic liaison.</p>\n<p>It was apparently too much to ask that Shen Qingqiu be an exception. Airplane Bro had devoted chapters of description to the effect that Luo Binghe had on prospective partners. A fully grown Luo Binghe is literally the most beautiful man in the world. He possesses the sexual magnetism to maintain a harem of 600 beauties. He moves like poetry, his eyes are like good omen stars. Could Shen Qingqiu be blamed?</p>\n<p>Shen Qingqiu can barely steady his breathing for the deep, hot sense of shame he feels. Luo Binghe had <em> watched</em>. He\u2019d <em> seen</em>.</p>\n<p>Luo Binghe at least isn\u2019t gloating. Shen Qingqiu\u2019s face couldn\u2019t bear it, if he did. Instead, Binghe just looks... lost. \u201cThis\u2026 This disciple doesn\u2019t understand.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThis one wonders,\u201d Shen Qingqiu responds dryly, \u201cWhat Luo Binghe had thought to find.\u201d Certainly not his Shizun perving on him.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, no \u2013\u201d Luo Binghe looks frustrated to tears. \u201cIt was supposed to show me what would make<em> you </em>happy!\u201d</p>\n<p>Shen Qingqiu is tired and half-drugged. \u201cDidn\u2019t it?\u201d He responds wearily. \u201cA Qing Jing Peak where I never had to betray my disciple?\u201d</p>\n<p>The silence is long.</p>\n<p>Shen Qingqiu wonders what he said.</p>\n<p>\u201cShizun wasn\u2019t afraid of me in there,\u201d notes Luo Binghe, distantly. \u201cEven though Shizun was still a righteous cultivator and this one remained a lowly half-demon. I\u2019d thought that maybe the difference was that the dream disciple didn\u2019t keep his demonic cultivation a secret.\u201d</p>\n<p>Shen Qingqiu\u2019s head swims.</p>\n<p>\u201cBut the difference was that Shizun never betrayed me.\u201d Luo Binghe sounds firmer. \u201cShizun never wanted to betray me \u2013 to do that, to this disciple.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat? <em> Of course </em>I didn\u2019t,\u201d Shen Qingqiu snaps irritably. \u201cWho do you think this teacher is?\u201d</p>\n<p>And maybe Shen Qingqiu shouldn\u2019t have said that.</p>\n<p>Shen Qingqiu\u2019s head is still stuffed with cotton. In the novel, this pseudo-drugged state had been the perfect mechanism to follow up dream papapa with real papapa. For Shen Qingqiu, it forces him to make his case from a prone position on the ground. In a sweeping and defeated gesture, he drapes one long arm over his eyes. Maybe it\u2019ll be easier to say these things into the darkness of his inner elbow.</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course I didn\u2019t <em> want </em>to,\u201d he grinds out. \u201cWhat monster raises a child and delights in their suffering?\u201d</p>\n<p>Shen Qingqiu can only guess what Luo Binghe\u2019s expression looks like.</p>\n<p>\u201cBut now you\u2019re scared of me.\u201d Binghe\u2019s voice cracks.</p>\n<p>Even thinking \u2013 even knowing \u2013 it <em> must </em> be an act, Shen Qingqiu\u2019s foolish, sentimental heart twinges. \u201c<em>Binghe</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re scared of me,\u201d Binghe presses. \u201cYou think I\u2019m going to hurt you.\u201d</p>\n<p>It\u2019s intended as a question, but it\u2019s one which Shen Qingqiu has no good answers for.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2026 you think I\u2019m going to hurt you <em> because you betrayed me.</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>It\u2019s too late. That big, beautiful, protagonist\u2019s brain of Binghe\u2019s \u2013 the same brain that picked apart countless plots and betrayals in his novel \u2013 has seized on Shen Qingqiu\u2019s careless words. Binghe\u2019s never been stupid.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter why, does it? You didn\u2019t want to. You... You thought you had to. You regret it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Shen Qingqiu can only listen as Luo Binghe pieces together broken pieces of truth.</p>\n<p>\u201c...And you think you deserve to be hurt for it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Something in Binghe\u2019s tone sours in Shen Qingqiu\u2019s stomach.</p>\n<p>Shen Qingqiu looks up from under his arm at Luo Binghe and again, tries to say something \u2013 anything \u2013 but there isn\u2019t anything to say. The heart of the matter, while Binghe hasn\u2019t grasped the full truth of it, is that Binghe isn\u2019t wrong. If Luo Binghe were to wreak a bloody variety of vengeance on Shen Qingqiu here and now, Shen Qingqiu wouldn\u2019t find him particularly unjustified.</p>\n<p>Really, it was something of a miracle that Luo Binghe hadn\u2019t done it yet. In the novel, Luo Binghe had always been quick to dispense vengeance.</p>\n<p>\u201c...Shizun! I would never!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Never what?</em>\u201d Shen Qingqiu is stripped of his allies, his purpose, his qi, and his dignity, stretched out on the floor of a tea room in Huan Hua Palace. It\u2019s enough that he lets out a haughty bark of laughter. \u201cNever hurt your Shizun? Bind your Shizun? Reduce your Shizun to <em> this?\u201d</em></p>\n<p>Shen Qingqiu flings his arm out dramatically. <em> Ridiculous. </em></p>\n<p>\u201cBe content, Luo Binghe.\u201d Shen Qingqiu is so, so tired, and hopes it doesn\u2019t soften his attempt at a glare into something too pathetic. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing of that tea-induced happiness that this teacher could <em> possibly </em>be more deprived of.\u201d</p>\n<p>And with that, Shen Qingqiu closes his eyes again. Maybe the tea hasn\u2019t completely left his system yet. Maybe, if he falls back asleep, he\u2019ll have a few more moments of that peaceful night on Qing Jing Peak, holding a much beloved disciple.</p>\n<p>It is many, many minutes later that he hears Luo Binghe leave the room.</p>\n<p>Shen Qingqiu had set out to be miserable. What had he expected?</p>\n<p>-</p>\n<p>Shen Qingqiu doesn\u2019t feel the distinct prickle of Luo Binghe\u2019s gaze for days.</p>\n<p>He keeps busy.</p>\n<p>He practices his qin. The one-time Peak Lord of the scholarly Qing Jing Peak ruthlessly demolishes the musicians of Huan Hua Palace, wearing a dismissive smile as his strings wail mournfully. Gongyi Xiao kindly requests a game of qi; Shen Qingqiu consents to play white and ruthlessly demolishes him, too. When he turns to calligraphy, he copies the pining sweet verses of a more sentimental author \u2013 <em> high mountain, how I long to reach you! </em>The Huan Hua disciples in the library sigh over his shoulder.</p>\n<p>Shen Qingqiu tries, and fails, to not think of Luo Binghe.</p>\n<p>Maybe, in this new version of &lt;&lt;Proud Immortal Demon Way,&gt;&gt; Shen Qingqiu\u2019s part of the story was done now? The scum villain has met his comeuppance, and protagonist Luo Binghe needs not spare him a single thought ever after?</p>\n<p>Isn\u2019t that what Shen Qingqiu wanted?</p>\n<p>His heart aches.</p>\n<p>When he finally sees Luo Binghe again, over a week later, he nearly breaks his fan \u2013 because Luo Binghe stands by a courtyard pond with two slender figures, both in Qing Jing Peak\u2019s pale greens and whites: Ming Fan and Ning Yingying.</p>\n<p>Shen Qingqiu\u2019s heart leaps for half a moment \u2013 Ning Yingying is probably safe, but Shen Qingqiu isn\u2019t <em> in a condition </em>to protect his head disciple \u2013 before looking closer and seeing no hostility. The conversation seems amiable enough.</p>\n<p>But the terms of Shen Qingqiu\u2019s sentence don\u2019t permit contact with Cang Qiong Sect. He can\u2019t approach, so he just stares at his former disciples with an uncharacteristic lack of discretion.</p>\n<p>They seem in good health. His peak\u2019s reputation for producing elegant scholars is well-deserved and on display: Ming Fan and Ning Yingying are both fine-looking cultivators, Ming Fan a solemn counterpoint to Ning Yingying\u2019s fluid animation.</p>\n<p>Luo Binghe looks peerless as always, his dark robes accentuated by the pale and graceful Qing Jing Peak disciples\u2019.</p>\n<p>What are Ming Fan and Ning Yingying doing here, and why are they talking to Luo Binghe? Their last meeting, to Shen Qingqiu\u2019s knowledge, had been as Luo Binghe\u2019s opponents at the trial. It must be sect business, but Shen Qingqiu can\u2019t think what would bring this pair in particular, especially since the turmoil of Shen Qingqiu\u2019s departure would have fallen hardest on Ming Fan.</p>\n<p>And what are they talking about so cheerfully with Luo Binghe? Had they forgotten his lies? How he\u2019d sentenced their Shizun to imprisonment?</p>\n<p>...Had they forgotten Shen Qingqiu already\u2026?</p>\n<p>Then Ning Yingying sees him first. She smacks Ming Fan several times, pointing.</p>\n<p>Then, despite knowing very well the conditions of Shen Qingqiu\u2019s captivity, both she and Ming Fan hurry to him, calling excitedly.</p>\n<p>\u201cShizun!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShizun, we\u2019re here!\u201d</p>\n<p>The terms of Shen Qingqiu\u2019s sentence don\u2019t permit contact with Cang Qiong Sect. Luo Binghe is <em> right there. </em>Shen Qingqiu is cognizant of the rules, he really is, but it\u2019s been several months and they\u2019re both suddenly standing in front of him. It\u2019s no use. He can\u2019t resist.</p>\n<p>Shen Qingqiu has two hands, and he places one each on Ming Fan and Ning Yingying\u2019s heads.</p>\n<p>Luo Binghe watches.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis one sees that, and is certain that Qing Jing Peak has thrived in your care.\u201d Shen Qingqiu is aware his fondness is showing. \u201cWhat brings two of Qing Jing Peak\u2019s finest to Huan Hua Palace?\u201d</p>\n<p>Both disciples puff up proudly.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re here to escort Shizun home!\u201d</p>\n<p>...What.</p>\n<p>Ning Yingying smiles, sunshine bright. \u201cSect Leader Yue is finishing things up with the Palace Master!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLiu-shishu is still banned from the Huan Hua Palace grounds, but he\u2019s waiting outside the gates with Shang-shishu.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLiu-shishu tried to help with classes too, but Sect Leader Yue said you wouldn\u2019t like it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShang-shishu has been a great help running the Peak, though, in Shizun\u2019s absence!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cEveryone has been so worried! But it\u2019s all turned out for the best, doesn\u2019t Shizun think?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>What,</em>\u201d blurts Shen Qingqiu.</p>\n<p>Ning Yingying\u2019s pretty doe eyes and Ming Fan\u2019s refined features falter, and they both look at Luo Binghe. Luo Binghe had followed his shixiong and shijie when they approached their Shizun, but stopped a few paces away. He stands apart, quietly observing \u2013 and when Shen Qingqiu meets his eyes, Luo Binghe\u2019s gaze skitters down to the ground, avoiding eye contact.</p>\n<p>Ning Yingying and Ming Fan look away from Luo Binghe to send complicated glances to each other, and then look back to Shen Qingqiu.</p>\n<p>\u201cShizun, did no one tell you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShizun, we \u2013\u201d</p>\n<p>Great big tears well up in Ning Yingying\u2019s eyes. Ming Fan tilts his chin up in a way that suggested he was trying not to stare at his feet.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe should have had more faith in Luo-shidi,\u201d Ming Fan says morosely.</p>\n<p>Shen Qingqiu wonders if he\u2019s been drugged again.</p>\n<p>\u201cLuo-shidi wouldn\u2019t let anyone see you, and we had all thought the worst, but\u2026\u201d Ming Fan is accustomed both to failure and to being wrong, but has never liked admitting either. \u201cHe\u2019s disproven all the charges against you, Shizun, and withdrawn his own.\u201d</p>\n<p>Ning Yingying nods vigorously. \u201cA-Luo only made a charge at Shizun\u2019s trial to make sure he\u2019d have a voice in the sentencing! Your name is cleared, Shizun!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCleared?\u201d demands Shen Qingqiu. His disciples \u2013 they\u2019re his disciples, once more? \u2013 both nod.</p>\n<p>He reels.</p>\n<p>This is a joke. A trap. A trick. Shen Qingqiu\u2019s fate is to be a miserable captive for the rest of his life, while Luo Binghe goes on to succeed in his many adventures, amassing a harem of beauties and concubines. Shen Qingqiu doesn\u2019t get to go home and dies old and miserable. That\u2019s how this story ends. That\u2019s a good ending, for the likes of him.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis\u2026\u201d Shen Qingqiu doesn\u2019t even know what to ask. There are too many questions.</p>\n<p>The only question that he has the answer to, really, is how. He looks to Luo Binghe, who is still staring resolutely at the ground.</p>\n<p>Luo Binghe has cleared his name. His ability to do so isn\u2019t in question \u2013 he\u2019s the protagonist, and even if Shen Qingqiu had really been a monster, Luo Binghe\u2019s will reigns supreme in this world \u2013 but Shen Qingqiu can\u2019t begin to fathom why. It might not even matter why, just that he\u2019s done it.</p>\n<p>\u201cBinghe,\u201d starts Shen Qingqiu, with no idea what to say.</p>\n<p>Luo Binghe, standing tall in the dark cultivator robes he now prefers, peerlessly handsome, flinches.</p>\n<p>\n<em> Flinches. </em>\n</p>\n<p>...<em>This </em> Luo Binghe? <em> Flinching </em> from <em> Shen Qingqiu? </em></p>\n<p>This is a Luo Binghe that has come fully into his demonic inheritance and tamed the Demon Heart blade, Xin Mo. Shen Qingqiu had once taught Luo Binghe everything he knew; there was nothing in Shen Qingqiu\u2019s repetoire that Luo Binghe couldn\u2019t counter. Shen Qingqiu was weaker in every way. Why would Luo Binghe flinch away at a word? Luo Binghe hadn\u2019t flinched from him since Shen Qingqiu had first arrived in this world, fearful of the original goods\u2019 abuse.</p>\n<p>At that thought, Shen Qingqiu feels a pang of completely justified outrage. He\u2019d only ever hurt Luo Binghe the one time, and once had been quite enough! More than enough! Beyond that one obvious exception, Shen Qingqiu had spoiled Luo Binghe whenever possible.</p>\n<p>Flinching? From Shen Qingqiu? <em> Why? </em> This Luo Binghe was well-treated! This Binghe has practically <em> none </em>of the original abusive backstory in common with the novel\u2019s protagonist!</p>\n<p>At that, Shen Qingqiu blinks.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s true; this Binghe really had relatively little in common with the novel\u2019s protagonist. What a thought, that is.</p>\n<p>Once Shen Qingqiu had replaced the original goods and disabled OOC restrictions, his Binghe hadn\u2019t experienced any of the hardships of the original. Bullying wasn\u2019t tolerated on his Qing Jing Peak. Shen Qingqiu had devoted long hours to personally training Luo Binghe. He\u2019d played favorites badly; Luo Binghe had lived in his home, been given best pick of night hunts, and received affectionate gestures beyond any other disciple. Shen Qingqiu had rewarded the white lotus for his white lotus traits.</p>\n<p>Unlike the Luo Binghe of &lt;&lt;Proud Immortal Demon Way,&gt;&gt; the Luo Binghe that Shen Qingqiu had raised had entered the Abyss knowing both his capabilities and how to improve them. He\u2019d been growing into self-confidence. He\u2019d had a firm foundation for his cultivation and an excellent grasp of the basics \u2013 this Binghe\u2019d had the skills to emerge from the Abyss years early.</p>\n<p>The idea ties a knot of itself in the deepest snarl of Shen Qingqiu\u2019s mind, like a skein of red silk string. The thread of it unspools before Shen Qingqiu entirely on its own, and Shen Qingqiu can only watch in horror as the thread of thought unravels.</p>\n<p>\n<em> \u201cNo, you\u2019re Shizun \u2013\u201d </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em> \u201cShizun could have asked this disciple to assist \u2013\u201d </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em> \u201cShizun?\u201d </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em> \u201c...Shizun\u2026?\u201d </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em> \u201c...This disciple wanted to know what makes Shizun happy.\u201d </em>\n</p>\n<p>Luo Binghe looks up hesitantly, waiting. Watching.</p>\n<p>...Has Shen Qingqiu misunderstood him?</p>\n<p>Luo Binghe is now staring at him again, and for the first time, Shen Qingqiu sees past the carefully crafted facade. There are dark smudges under his eyes. His hands are slightly shaking. He\u2019s spent the last week traveling back and forth, gathering and very probably fabricating evidence to exonerate Shen Qingqiu.</p>\n<p>Has Shen Qingqiu misunderstood him?</p>\n<p>Shen Qingqiu thinks the answer might be yes.</p>\n<p>\u201cBinghe,\u201d Shen Qingqiu says again, and his throat closes behind the name.</p>\n<p>Luo Binghe is still watching him. Luo Binghe watches him whenever he gets the chance.</p>\n<p>Shen Qingqiu is off-balance but he knows how to maintain appearances. He straightens and puts away his fan. \u201cBinghe,\u201d he says quietly, \u201cThis teacher hopes his disciple will join us on our journey home.\u201d</p>\n<p>Binghe nods, eyes filling with unshed tears. Shen Qingqiu\u2019s sentimental heart goes <em> ping</em>.</p>\n<p>-</p>\n<p>Mountain air and the combined scents of grass and bamboo fill Shen Qingqiu\u2019s lungs. He stands on Qing Jing Peak, breathes deeply, and permits the comfort.</p>\n<p>He hadn\u2019t thought he\u2019d ever stand here again, home, flanked by well-meaning brothers and disciples. Shen Qingqiu is grateful to them, but hard-pressed to pay attention \u2013 distracted by all the things he <em> wants </em> and <em> can actually have.</em></p>\n<p>He wants to enjoy Yue Qingyuan fretting over him, and he wants to watch Liu Qingge tilt at whatever threat he\u2019s noticed, but he also wants to correct Ning Yingying\u2019s erhu forms, and meditate with Ming Fan, and play something cheerful under the quiet spring\u2019s plum tree, and write out joyous poetry \u2013 <em> high mountain, how I long to reach you; breathing your sweetness even here! </em>\u2013 and maybe bully Airplane Bro a bit more because he deserves it.</p>\n<p>Shen Qingqiu is emotionally exhausted, and the greatest part of him wants nothing more than to curl up in his bamboo house and <em> sleep</em>.</p>\n<p>Shang Qinghua takes his leave soon after their arrival. Yue Qingyuan and Liu Qingge stay and fuss for nearly an hour, so Shen Qingqiu implies that his shixiong might both depart and let him rest, and they do, graciously.</p>\n<p>Because for all the things that Shen Qingqiu wants, there is something that he needs to do, first, or he will never be able to quiet the anxious strings still humming in his chest.</p>\n<p>So then, he turns to Binghe.</p>\n<p>Binghe has kept something of a distance, though his eyes haven\u2019t left Shen Qingqiu. His gaze has been restless, flitting over Shen Qingqiu\u2019s shoulders, down the sweep of his hair, frequently settling on the motion of his hands and the punctuation of his fan gestures.</p>\n<p>With Shen Qingqiu\u2019s eyes on him, their gazes meet, and the eye contact is a physical shock to the soul \u2013 but Shen Qingqiu has been thinking about the best way to do this since they left Huan Hua Palace.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis teacher hopes his disciple might join him for some tea.\u201d</p>\n<p>Binghe startles.</p>\n<p>Shen Qingqiu closes his fan to reveal his expression, unsure what expression he\u2019s even wearing. \u201cPlease,\u201d he adds, quietly.</p>\n<p>The bamboo house is beautifully, perfectly the same. It seems the disciples of Qing Jing Peak have been faithfully maintaining it; the furniture is dusted and the linens seem fresh. There\u2019s a faint impression of the incense he favors \u2013 a light floral, nothing heavy \u2013 and two of the windows are open to the breeze. Shen Qingqiu steps forward slowly at first, letting the familiar feel of it, the feel of coming home, sink in once more.</p>\n<p>Binghe follows him to the low table, then tries to pass him into the kitchen area.</p>\n<p>Shen Qingqiu stops him with two fingers on Binghe\u2019s shoulder. \u201cSit,\u201d he orders, pressing down gently. He must be imagining Binghe\u2019s shiver.</p>\n<p>Binghe goes down, but protests, \u201cShizun, this disciple must prepare.\u201d</p>\n<p>Shen Qingqiu breezes by loftily. \u201cThis teacher is the one apologizing to his disciple. It would be inappropriate for that same disciple to serve.\u201d</p>\n<p>He makes the mistake of turning to look at Binghe. Binghe is kneeling on the floor, broad shoulders on display as he sits very properly at the tea table, his dark robes and dark hair framing an absolutely flawless face, eyes wide and huge.</p>\n<p>The dream ruined him. If Shen Qingqiu were a better master, he wouldn\u2019t be noticing these things about his disciple.</p>\n<p>Especially given how distressed Binghe seems. \u201cBut this disciple is the one that needs to apologize!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBinghe has nothing to apologize for,\u201d Shen Qingqiu says succintly. He looks down at his arms, whole and still attached. \u201cBinghe would have been in his rights to do far worse. This teacher is grateful that Binghe chose differently.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2026 That\u2026\u201d Luo Binghe practically gasped, leaning, swaying towards Shen Qingqiu. His words burst out of him in a torrent, noisy, and each tumbling over the next. \u201cI was just trying to keep you from running away! You were always running from me, Shizun - I didn\u2019t know you thought I was going to hurt you \u2013 but \u2013 I\u2019m sorry, Shizun! I \u2013 <em> I was wrong!\u201d</em></p>\n<p>Luo Binghe\u2019s hands are buried in his own hair, his voice raising in pitch, tears welling in his big, beautiful eyes \u2013 and he nearly collapses, whining quietly, \u201cThis\u2026 This disciple didn\u2019t mean to take away everything that makes Shizun happy\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>He looks miserable, and Shen Qingqiu has had quite enough of misery, lately. Two steps, and Shen Qingqiu is kneeling next to Binghe, pulling Binghe practically into his lap \u2013 and Binghe lets it happen, making an indeterminable noise as his face is pressed into Shen Qingqiu\u2019s shoulder. Shen Qingqiu pats Luo Binghe\u2019s hair with a tired hand that feels heavier than it should.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Enough, </em> Binghe,\u201d Shen Qingqiu sighs. \u201cThis teacher managed <em> that </em>all on his own.\u201d</p>\n<p>A few minutes pass with one of Shen Qingqiu\u2019s hands rubbing comfortingly up and down Binghe\u2019s arm and shoulder, while the other gently musses Binghe\u2019s hair. Slowly, very slowly, the sobbing and sniffling stop.</p>\n<p>Binghe\u2019s forehead nuzzles over to press skin-to-skin against Shen Qingqiu\u2019s neck. Shen Qingqiu is a disgusting man and a terrible Shizun, it\u2019s becoming increasingly clear, because even through his exhaustion he shivers.</p>\n<p>\u201cI was <em> wrong, </em>Shizun,\u201d Binghe repeats miserably, stubbornly, the noise of it muffled.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis teacher already said enough,\u201d scolds Shen Qingqiu. \u201cIf anything, your Shizun has debts to repay to you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShizun\u2013\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThis teacher was selfish, and put his well-being above your happiness.\u201d Shen Qingqiu runs his nails over Binghe\u2019s scalp. \u201cThis one promises to be better in the future.\u201d</p>\n<p>Binghe waits a moment, two moments, before pressing his forehead harder into Shen Qingqiu, still rubbing. Shen Qingqiu does his best to ignore how well-muscled Binghe\u2019s shoulder and bicep are.</p>\n<p>\u201c...Shizun really didn\u2019t want to\u2026 to hurt me?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c...Shizun didn\u2019t want me to go?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, Binghe.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShizun doesn\u2019t hate me?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNever, Binghe.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIs Shizun still afraid of me?\u201d</p>\n<p>Shen Qingqiu breathes in the smell of Binghe\u2019s hair and quietly notices that he isn\u2019t.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, Binghe. I\u2019m not.\u201d Shen Qingqiu says it, surprised, to himself more than the man in his arms. He feels light.</p>\n<p>Binghe\u2019s hands unclench from Shen Qingqiu\u2019s robes to lay flat on his sides. Shen Qingqiu is of a height with Binghe but a much narrower build; Binghe\u2019s broad palms and long fingers curl around his waist and ribs.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd\u2026 Shizun wants to make me happy?\u201d murmurs Binghe, pulling back to look into Shen Qingqiu\u2019s eyes.</p>\n<p>Shen Qingqiu meets his gaze squarely. \u201cMy disciple should know. If keeping this teacher in Huan Hua Palace had made Binghe happy, than that is where this teacher would have stayed.\u201d</p>\n<p>Binghe watches him, wide-eyed.</p>\n<p>Intrusively, Shen Qingqiu becomes aware of Binghe\u2019s body heat, and with his hands pressing into Shen Qingqiu, there\u2019s an implication of the weight of his larger body, how it might feel if it pressed into him, how it might feel to be pressed against, warm and weighty. Binghe hums, a deep and throaty noise.</p>\n<p>Shen Qingqiu\u2019s mouth goes dry. His face feels hot.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s your disciple! <em> Disciple! </em></p>\n<p>Binghe leans in \u2013 <em> leans in! </em>\u2013 big, beautiful eyes still looking at him from under those long lashes \u2013 and bumps his forehead against Shen Qingqiu\u2019s.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis disciple\u2026 would be most happy making his Shizun most happy,\u201d Binghe murmurs, shyly, coy. \u201cOr at least, this one would like to try.\u201d</p>\n<p>Shen Qingqiu inhales sharply. That\u2019s what the Illusory Binghe of Shen Qingqiu\u2019s tea dream had said, before Shen Qingqiu had \u2013 he had \u2013 and Binghe had <em> watched the whole thing </em>\u2013</p>\n<p>\u2013 he wants \u2013</p>\n<p>\u2013 embarrassing! \u2013 <em> shameful! </em>\u2013</p>\n<p>\u2013 he squeezes his eyes shut in frustration, turning his head away, and immediately hates himself for it.</p>\n<p>Usually, Shen Qingqiu keeps his head in a crisis. He excels in a crisis. But he just \u2013 he just doesn\u2019t have the face to navigate this situation. Binghe couldn\u2019t be serious! He can have anyone \u2013 literally, anyone he wants, he\u2019s the protagonist of a stallion novel \u2013 and he\u2019s angling to kiss Shen Qingqiu?</p>\n<p>This can\u2019t be what Binghe wants, what will make Binghe happy \u2013 Shen Qingqiu couldn\u2019t possibly be fortunate enough to share a dream of happiness with peerless, flawless harem master protagonist Luo Binghe.</p>\n<p><em> It was supposed to show me what would make you happy, </em>Luo Binghe had said in the tea room.</p>\n<p>Shen Qingqiu isn\u2019t shaking. He <em> isn\u2019t</em>.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a moment of silence, and then a whisper of cloth.</p>\n<p>\u201c...This disciple can\u2019t read Shizun very well, can he?\u201d Luo Binghe muses quietly, his voice gone deep. \u201cThis one now knows what Shizun wants, and what would make Shizun happiest, but wouldn\u2019t know by watching him now.\u201d</p>\n<p>The vibration of his voice grows closer, quieter.</p>\n<p>\u201cStill, this one begins to understand. Shizun calls his disciples troublesome and needy, but dreams of guiding their way. Shizun blames many things on Shang-shishu, but dreams of sharing friendly visits and strange words. Shizun evades his sect leader, but dreams of being useful to him and Liu-shishu\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>Shen Qingqiu tenses as a nose trails against his ear, as Luo Binghe\u2019s hand trailing over his neck.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd Shizun... Shizun avoids this disciple\u2019s touch, but dreams of putting his hands in my hair.\u201d</p>\n<p>A gentle grip on Shen Qingqiu\u2019s wrist sends goosebumps and a violent shiver up his arm. Luo Binghe pulls Shen Qingqiu's hand up \u2013 eyes still clenched shut, Shen Qingqiu immediately grips the thick hair he\u2019s been guided to, trying to ground himself.</p>\n<p>\u201cShizun scolds this disciple, turns his head away from this disciple \u2013\u201d</p>\n<p>Shen Qingqiu\u2019s eyes fly open; a small smile quirks Binghe\u2019s lips. It\u2019s complicated, smug and hungry.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s alright, Shizun,\u201d he says softly, eyes glowing red, \u201cShizun doesn\u2019t need to ask. This disciple already knows what he dreams of.\u201d</p>\n<p>Shen Qingqiu gasps for air; it sounds like a sob.</p>\n<p>And then \u2013</p>\n<p>Luo Binghe devours Shen Qingqiu\u2019s mouth.</p>\n<p>He isn\u2019t good at it.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s running off of warring instincts, running big worshipful hands over his robes while his teeth nip mercilessly, digging wet and toothy marks into Shen Qingqiu\u2019s lips. Shen Qingqiu gasps again into Binghe\u2019s mouth, because \u2013 because Luo Binghe doesn\u2019t know how to kiss! Binghe \u2013</p>\n<p>Binghe is clueless and clumsy, desperate, with only instinct to guide him and not all of it human.</p>\n<p><em> Ah</em>, Shen Qingqiu\u2019s sentimental heart wants to wrap him in cotton, but he wraps his arms around those big, broad shoulders instead and holds him close, one hand still clutching at his thick hair above the nape of his neck. Shen Qingqiu tries to gentle the kiss, to teach, to be affectionate, but the nuance of it is completely lost. Binghe is still biting, biting his mouth, and \u2013 it\u2019s not good, it hurts, but \u2013</p>\n<p>But it\u2019s hot breath mixing with his, and it\u2019s wet and it\u2019s <em> Luo Binghe\u2019s mouth on him</em>, and Shen Qingqiu <em> whines</em>.</p>\n<p>The sound startles Binghe. He pulls back, but Shen Qingqiu has a fist in Luo Binghe\u2019s hair and pulls with it, hard, not letting him go far.</p>\n<p>Shen Qingqiu is breathing heavily enough to feel the hot shame of it \u2013 even more, if that\u2019s possible \u2013 embarrassed at the hitching sounds of his own panting.</p>\n<p>Binghe\u2019s eyes are glowing red through long lashes, thrilled, adoring, awestruck. The pale skin of Binghe\u2019s throat, set against his dark clothing, is bright and clean. He smells of jasmine rice and lotus blossoms. He wears black silk, but his hair and eyes are drawn in a darker ink, somehow gleaming even brighter than the light that they reflect.</p>\n<p>Shen Qingqiu pants, and swallows. Pulling Binghe sideways by the hair, he keeps pulling \u2013 both of them, down \u2013 down to the mats of the bamboo house.</p>\n<p>Binghe follows, shakily, hands either worshipful or rough as he remembers and then forgets himself, all untutored teeth and spit and fits of raw possession, overwhelmed and overwhelming and whining all at once.</p>\n<p>The length of Luo Binghe\u2019s body presses against him, all heat and heavy weight through their clothes, a thigh pushing up between his. Another noise punches out of Shen Qingqiu\u2019s throat when his hips automatically press up into the pressure given, and the shameless, sinuous motion sends Binghe into a full-body shudder. Shen Qingqiu can feel it, through Binghe\u2019s robes \u2013 the muscles of Binghe\u2019s back under his palm, flexing and pulling.</p>\n<p>Shen Qingqiu tries to guide him, shifting them \u2013 Binghe clutches him as they move together \u2013 he\u2019s terrible, no rhythm, he\u2019s so close, they\u2019re so close \u2013 this, the friction, their clothes are still on \u2013 Shen Qingqiu is hot and panting and he can\u2019t be the one making those shameless noises \u2013 ah, it\u2019s not really so bad though is it \u2013 Ah \u2013</p>\n<p>And Shen Qingqiu is there, too quickly, everything from his shoulders through his thighs down to the curling of his toes flexes, his arms around Binghe pulling and his hands fisting in silk \u2013 <em> Binghe! </em>\u2013</p>\n<p>Shen Qingqiu becomes aware of himself again with his head buried in Binghe\u2019s hair, sticking to his brow, and an uncomfortable mess in his inner robes \u2013</p>\n<p>\u2013 and the desperate whines of Binghe still chasing relief against Shen Qingqiu\u2019s thigh, unable to catch it. Binghe pants into his shoulder, his neck, his hair, sounding almost in pain as his entire body works towards something it\u2019s having trouble finding. The poor thing; all that demonic stamina is only cruel in a situation like this.</p>\n<p>Shen Qingqiu\u2019s heart is full and sore and tender; he rubs his arms soothingly up Binghe\u2019s back, trying to communicate care and support, but it only makes Binghe whine harder.</p>\n<p>\u201cBinghe, it\u2019s alright,\u201d he comforts mindlessly, humming, voice hitching with Binghe\u2019s thrusts against him, \u201cYou can\u2026 You can\u2026 Binghe, you\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>It\u2019s really too embarrassing to say, even like this, but those are tears, and Binghe is sobbing, and for his sake, Shen Qingqiu summons the will \u2013 in his embarrassment, his voice sounds hoarse and harsh \u2013</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Binghe! Now!</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>It\u2019s an order. Binghe comes noisily, rubbing his face and mouth and teeth wherever he can reach, voice cracking on a keen of \u201c<em>Shizun\u2026!</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>And the moving stutters to a stop.</p>\n<p>Binghe\u2019s muscles relax entirely on top of him.</p>\n<p>And then the room is quiet. Shen Qingqiu, sweaty, sated, still breathing harder than normal, has his face buried in Binghe\u2019s neck, nose tucked just below his ear.</p>\n<p>Binghe\u2019s mass of hair spills over him, all dark and soft. It smells good. \u201cYou\u2019ve made me \u2013 you make me really happy, Shizun.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGood,\u201d Shen Qingqiu says, and his voice is deeper and throatier than usual. Binghe shivers.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis disciple hopes... that we might both make each other happy from now on?\u201d Binghe whispers shyly, soft and syrupy, his lax and heavy body pressing Shen Qingqiu into the mats, huge and hot and sticky and infinitely precious. Shen Qingqiu almost has trouble breathing from the weight of it.</p>\n<p>\u201c....Yes,\u201d he agrees, voice even quieter.</p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t want to move, so he doesn\u2019t. He clutches Binghe tighter to himself, and feels entirely at peace.</p>\n<p>-</p>\n<p>Things are a good different, on Qing Jing Peak.</p>\n<p>\u201cShizun,\u201d Ming Fan addresses him one day, bowing respectfully, \u201cThis disciple wants you to know.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHm?\u201d Shen Qingqiu responds, distracted with paperwork.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis disciple has recently spoken with Luo Binghe, and both myself and Yingying-shimei are satisfied regarding his honorable intentions towards Shizun.\u201d</p>\n<p>Shen Qingqiu chokes, because not only do Ming Fan and Ning Yingying <em> know</em>, but they gave <em> Luo Binghe </em> a <em> shovel talk</em>. Ming Fan nods, satisified, and that\u2019s only the beginning \u2013 one by one, the important people in Shen Qingqiu\u2019s life find out.</p>\n<p>Notably, Liu Qingge also gives Luo Binghe a shovel talk. There is great emphasis on the shovel. It is\u2026 destructive. It\u2019s still not as bad as Yue Qingyuan, who walks in one morning with Luo Binghe still in Shen Qingqiu\u2019s bed. Yue Qingyuan pretends to be oblivious, characteristically turning a cheerful blind eye to it. Shen Qingqiu wants to weep with gratitude.</p>\n<p>Airplane is the only one that Shen Qingqiu actually tells about his new relationship.</p>\n<p>\u201cBro,\u201d responds Shang Qinghua, wounded. \u201cBro. You <em> bent </em> him! You <em> bent </em>my stallion protagonist!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>My </em>stallion protagonist,\u201d Shen Qingqiu sniffs.</p>\n<p>Luo Binghe seems unruffled by all of this, but leaves large red marks on Shen Qingqiu\u2019s neck all the same.</p>\n<p>Still. These things settle quickly, in the over-arching rhythm of life. Shen Qingqiu is returned to to his place in this world. He stands on the edge of the bamboo grove, a favorite cedar and silk peony fan in his hands.</p>\n<p>It doesn\u2019t feel like it\u2019s going to rain anytime soon, but this is fine.</p>\n<p>One needs both rain and sun to be able to appreciate the other, after all.</p>\n<p>Shen Qingqiu has been in two separate bodies and lived two separate lives. He has been healthy and near-crippled in both, he has known family and solitude, and he begins to realize that happiness is not a thing captured and kept. It is a thing tended, and minded, and never taken for granted; a delicate plant that can be swept away with the first storm that passes, yet which might survive tempests if only the roots are strong enough.</p>\n<p>Shen Qingqiu has roots here, now, and the deepest of them is sticky, and devoted, and warm, and calls him \u201cShizun,\u201d in a deep and highly inappropriate tone of voice.</p>\n<p>Shameless!</p>\n<p>He waves the thought away with a fan gesture, but when large palms settle on his waist from behind and a sly grin presses to the side of his neck, Shen Qingqiu doesn\u2019t startle away.</p>\n<p>\u201cDid Shizun miss this disciple?\u201d Binghe grins widely into the crook of his shoulder, ready to be content whether he receives kind words or a firm whap of his Shizun\u2019s fan.</p>\n<p>Shen Qingqiu knows he\u2019s walking a dangerous line when he delicately thumbs his fan open and peers over it sidelong. It is.. Easier, to do things like this, knowing that the reaction will be overwhelmingly positive. Less humiliating, less shameful, than when such things are unknown.</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you need this teacher to confirm such things for you?\u201d he murmurs, glad to have his small smile hidden from sight.</p>\n<p>Binghe is well able to sense his Shizun\u2019s permissive mood, and hands on his waist pull Shen Qingqiu in. Heat creeps up Shen Qingqiu\u2019s neck as Binghe settles against him. Shen Qingqiu\u2019s immediate embarrassment and reflexive whap of his fan is only quelled by the fact that no one is in sight; he squirms in Binghe\u2019s iron grip for half a moment before deciding he doesn\u2019t have the face for it.</p>\n<p>He\u2019d put up more of a fight if Binghe didn\u2019t enjoy it so much. Really.</p>\n<p>He rests there, listening to the wind behind him in the bamboo, the distant laughter of Ning Yingying and Ming Fan, and the gentle breathing behind him. He taps his fan against the arms looped around him and tuts, to unsurprisingly little effect: not even Binghe could mistake the sound as anything but content. The arms around him only tighten.</p>\n<p>\"Really,\" murmurs Shen Qingqiu, settling in. \"Is this teacher not affectionate enough?\"</p>\n<p>\"Ah, respecting Shizun. This disciple had thought he was dreaming.\" Luo Binghe presses a bright smile against the tendon of his Shizun's neck, and watches him sigh, happy.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>"
