  "text": "<p>Park Jimin whistles along softly to the sound of the chirping birds outside as he pours hot water from his old black kettle into his dented tin cup for his morning drink of tea leaves and honey. Turning his head, he glances out his little cabin window, admiring the morning sunlight streaming through, casting a pretty sight of light through the mild darkness of his little world.</p>\n<p>He gathers his shears and his gloves and stuffs them into his little brown basket, getting ready for his usual morning trek through the hillside to gather herbs for his medicine and potions. The town doctor has sent over a request; he is low on his supply of licorice roots and ginseng, ingredients he can use to make a drink to calm tummy ailments.</p>\n<p>Jimin drinks his tea and rinses his cup away before he pulls his shaggy, old cape made of bear fur off the wall peg. He shakes it a few times to rid of anything that may have nested in it overnight before wrapping it around his shoulders and tying the string around his neck.</p>\n<p>He steps out his front door and breathes in the clean, crisp air, the cold breeze teasing the bridge of his nose until it\u2019s red. He leaves his home area and traipses down a familiar path into the forest, made from frequent walks and missions, eager to greet the only other family member he knows.</p>\n<p>\"Good morning, Grams,\" he says softly as he finally passes by the big oak tree where his beloved grandmother is buried, a huge stone marking her place of sleep. He'd put her there himself after she'd died 6 months ago. She too, had been a healer, and the only parent he'd ever known.</p>\n<p>Jimin remembers being a young omega, always questioning why they didn't live amongst the villagers of their pack, why they only visited the town occasionally. It isn't until he is older that he learns why he is ostracized from their own pack.</p>\n<p>Jimin had found out that it is because he is a scentless omega. Omegas born with his condition live a sad life, their life longevity shorter than normal omegas as well as the fact that they will be mateless for life, having no scent as well as no heat, nothing to assist with attracting others or childbearing. That\u2019s two strikes already against him - scentless and mateless. Scenting is important amongst wolves and to be an outsider puts him in the saddest position. However, he\u2019s learned not to dwell on what if\u2019s and what could be\u2019s and just live out whatever lifetime he is given. </p>\n<p>Their pack had feared it to be a contagious condition and though Jimin's grandmother knows otherwise, she still takes him away, if only to protect him from the snide remarks, the bullying and the harassment her grandson would have to deal with.</p>\n<p>Now, 23, Jimin lives alone in the same cabin, far from town, with nothing but the wilderness and nature around him; his friends the birds that chirp him awake each morning, the squirrels that visit the nut trees in his front yard, the deers that venture forth shyly to drink from his water well.</p>\n<p>He's taken over his grandmother's skill in making his living by making herbal concoctions and selling it to the village physician or gathering fruits and nuts and selling them to the peddlers at the markets. Some days are good, most days are bad. But he doesn't complain, he knows life could always be worst.</p>\n<p>Today starts off as any other day and Jimin blows a kiss softly towards his grandmother's site as he continues trudging along. He will stop to talk to her on his way back home, as per his custom since her burial there.</p>\n<p>The gentle wind rustles Jimin's blonde tresses and his silvery gray eyes crinkle in a smile as he spots a tiny little blue bird flitter around him. It's the same one, the one he's christened Gyuri. Gyuri had appeared two weeks ago and had accompanied him a certain ways along his morning journeys and Jimin, who thinks the color blue brings good luck, loves seeing her.</p>\n<p>\"Why hello Gyuri. Good of you to accompany me again today!\" he cheerfully calls out and watches as the bird perform a few acrobatic flips in the air as if in understanding. Jimin giggles softly and he slowly spins, following as the bird circles around him. </p>\n<p>The smile on his face freezes and then he gasps as his eyes land on a dark, furry lump beyond the snow-covered hill's slight slope. If it's a bear, Jimin is pretty much dead.</p>\n<p>Jimin stands still, hoping to not make a noise should it be the animal. After a minute of no movement, Jimin shifts slightly to his left and a spark of light next to the dark, unmoving lump hits his eyes. </p>\n<p>Ok...not a bear then. Bears do not stay still that long.</p>\n<p>Unable to help himself, Jimin tries to appease his curiosity by scooting forward a few steps. A strong sense of foreboding invade his senses, but he just tells himself to be brave and continues shuffling forward, slowly, quietly. </p>\n<p>He gasps softly when he is close enough to see that it is no animal, but another human, covered in a cape of dark fur, his dark brown head of hair ruffling in the wind's breeze.</p>\n<p>No longer worrying about his own self, Jimin's healer instincts kick in and he rushes forth to see if he can be of any help.</p>\n<p>A faint scent of alpha masculinity and virility hits Jimin as he falls to his knees beside the body and flips the heavy male over unto his back. He feels for a pulse and breathes an audible sigh of relief when he presses his fingers against the cold neck and feels the slight drumming against his fingertips. </p>\n<p>Jimin's eyes do a quick inventory, knowing by the garments that this is no ordinary alpha, he is some kind of a warrior, if the bow and arrows on his back and the heavy sword glinting up at him is any indication. The fur cape and vest he is wearing can feed Jimin for a whole year, and his boots are made of heavy, sturdy leather, a luxury Jimin has only ever seen in the cobbler's windows.</p>\n<p>There is blood on the alpha's temple and Jimin knows that that wound is what caused the warrior to fade out. He pushes back the alpha's dark bangs and blots at the wound with a strip of cloth he'd pulled from his basket. This man needs to get out of the cold if he is to survive and Jimin is not physically strong enough to get him back to his cabin by himself.</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>Jeon Jungkook stirs and tries to move out of the beam of sunlight directly hitting his closed eyelids. There is a thorough pounding in his temple that will not cease, but he also hears a soft, angelic voice singing from far away...</p>\n<p>Jungkook's eyes snap open and he sits up with a gasp as his mind recalls the events he last remembered taking place. He automatically reaches out for the sword at his side.</p>\n<p>\"Hey! Woah! You're safe! You're ok...you're in my home...\"</p>\n<p>The angelic voice halts Jungkook and he freezes as his vision adjusts to the dimness of the cabin he is in. His feet are warm and he notices that he is laid out by a wood fire, his boots gone, feet directed to the flames. He's covered in his fur jacket plus another old, worn-down fur cape. </p>\n<p>A presence settles down beside him and Jungkook looks over to see pretty silver eyes, blonde hair and cherubic cheeks. Jungkook sniffs. Nothing.</p>\n<p>\"I'm Park Jimin, a healer. You're in my cabin, there's no danger for you here.\"</p>\n<p>\"I...I can't smell you. Why?\"</p>\n<p>\"Oh...I'm...well, I'm scentless.\"</p>\n<p>Jungkook's eyes widen. A scentless omega. He's heard of them, but never seen one before. </p>\n<p>\"My sword...\"</p>\n<p>\"It's over there with your bow and arrows,\" Jimin points to the wall behind him and Jungkook sees his father's prized sword along with his own weapons leaning against the wall.</p>\n<p>\"How long have I been unconscious?\"</p>\n<p>\"I found you 2 days ago...I don't know how long you were out before then, but your wound was pretty fresh so I'd say you were lucky I found you when I did. Otherwise the bears would've ate you for their lunch.\"</p>\n<p>Jungkook isn't sure if that was an attempt at humor or not, it had been said in a pretty deadpanned tone.</p>\n<p>\"I...umm...I need to use the outdoors.\"</p>\n<p>\"Ok, let me help you up, you've been laid up a bit too long.\" </p>\n<p>Jungkook watches as the young, small omega gets up and reaches his hand out expectantly. Jungkook, not knowing what else to do, takes the help, allowing Jimin to grasp his upper arm in a supporting manner.</p>\n<p>When they get to the doorway, he removes his arm from the smaller's shoulders and hobbles slowly down the stairs into the direction of the shrubs in the back where Jimin points him to.</p>\n<p>The morning is fresh and dewy, a cold chill in the air. He takes care of his business and then stretches, really feeling his strength returning. He touches the cloth patch covering his right temple and then pats himself down, trying to feel for any other damage, sighing in relief when he is met only with soreness. </p>\n<p>He owes the omega a debt of gratitude.</p>\n<p>When he ambles back into the front of the cabin, he sees Jimin's small form by his stack of firewood against the opposite cabin wall. He stares for a bit, half of it out of curiosity, the other half in admiration of the omega's beauty. He has nothing to worry about, knowing that scentless omegas are a threat to no one, having no personal scent to attract alphas and betas and having no heats that need to be taken care of.</p>\n<p>He's just never been told they would be so beautiful.</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>Jimin bends down and picks up a few of the smaller logs into his arms. </p>\n<p>During his patient's unconscious state, Jimin had thought he was a ridiculously handsome alpha, but to see him awake in the daylight had struck him speechless. He really is quite a beautiful male, dark hair, big, intense eyes, tall, dominating height, sinewy muscles everywhere.</p>\n<p>Jimin doesn't need to be a regular omega to appreciate good looks. Based on looks alone, he thinks Jungkook's mate is pretty lucky, indeed.</p>\n<p>As he reaches for one more piece of wood, an encroaching shadow stops him and he looks up to find his patient next to him.</p>\n<p>\"Here, let me help you.\"</p>\n<p>Jimin hears him grunt out softly before he's transferred the ones in his arms into his own and picked up the last piece Jimin had been aiming for.</p>\n<p>\"What's your name?\" Jimin follows along as the alpha turns back towards the cabin. </p>\n<p>\"Jeon Jungkook from the Jeon Pack in the north.\"</p>\n<p>\"Ohhh...\" Jimin breathes out softly. He's heard all about the Jeon Pack. They're a very, if not the most, powerful of the Wolf packs in their region, high in numbers with very skilled warriors.</p>\n<p>\"Can I...can I ask what happened to you out there?\"</p>\n<p>\"Basically, I was being too careless.\"</p>\n<p>As they climb the front steps, Jimin almost stumbles into Jungkook's broad back when he abruptly stops. Following his gaze, Jimin sees that he's spotted the makeshift stretcher of logs tied together with ropes propped by the bushes. Jimin steps back as he turns around. </p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m guessing that\u2019s how you got me back here?\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cYes. You\u2019re a heavy wolf. I had to pull you onto it and then drag you that whole mile home.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jungkook grunts out an awkward thank you to which Jimin just smiles at him. </p>\n<p>They enter the cabin and Jimin walks over to push open the furs lining the other windows so more light can enter the dimness.</p>\n<p>\"I have two other friends here; we came for the fur trading and they're probably going crazy trying to find me right now. While they were resting up from our trip here, I ventured out and became the victim of a robbery. I knew better but I was-\" Jungkook hesitates, and, deciding not to divulge too much, lays the wood down on the floor next to the small fire pit of dying embers.</p>\n<p>\"Anyway, I'm going to have to return soon, my friends are probably tearing the town apart trying to find me.\"</p>\n<p>Jimin settles down on his cot against the wall. \"I'm sure they're worried. It must be nice to have friends. Especially close ones who would look for you.\"</p>\n<p>Jungkook sits back down on the makeshift bed he'd awoken in on the opposite side and looks at Jimin.</p>\n<p>\"You...don't have friends in your pack?\"</p>\n<p>\"I...\" Jimin bites his lip. \"I don't have a pack so I wouldn't have any friends. I have the animals that aren't afraid to venture out into my yard.\" he finishes with a small smile.</p>\n<p>Jungkook's eyes widen. \"No pack? No protection? How did you survive this long?\"</p>\n<p>\"Well...I had my grandmother up until 6 months ago...But she passed away and I'm learning to fend for myself.\"</p>\n<p>Jungkook's mind is aghast. An omega fending for himself? In the wild? He can't think of how lucky Jimin has been...in these same woods, before he'd been attacked, he\u2019d wondered upon a few poachers and bears in neighboring areas. Jungkook can't explain this sense of overwhelming protectiveness, but as he stares at the small form across from him, he can't fathom Jimin being all alone and getting hurt. </p>\n<p>\"Jimin. Why don't you have a pack? This is Yang territory, aren't you a part of theirs?\"</p>\n<p>\"I was. Not anymore. I'm scentless.\"</p>\n<p>Jungkook waits with a cocked brow, unsure why that matters.</p>\n<p>Jimin sighs. </p>\n<p>\"People don't like different around here. They feel that I may be contagious-\"</p>\n<p>\"That\u2019s stupid. Even with me not knowing much about the condition, I'm well aware that being scentless is not some sort of a disease.\"</p>\n<p>Jimin feels his eyes well up at the easy acceptance from someone, a stranger, no less.</p>\n<p>\"Thank you for saying that,\" he murmurs softly, lowering his eyes.</p>\n<p>\"I'm not sorry to say...your old pack is really stupid.\"</p>\n<p>Jimin giggles softly. \"It's ok. I've learned to adapt by myself.\"</p>\n<p>Jungkook is about to say something when he picks up a different scent.</p>\n<p>\"Shh!\" he hushes Jimin with one finger to his lips before moving to the open window overlooking the front of Jimin's open lawn.</p>\n<p>He waits. He knows who it is, but he needs to be completely sure, not wanting to jeopardize Jimin's safety.</p>\n<p>Horse and rider break through the barrier of trees and Jungkook breathes out a sigh of relief upon espying his friend Yoongi's white head of hair.</p>\n<p>\"I can smell you, young buck. Get your fuckin' ass out here, we've been worried sick!\" </p>\n<p>Jungkook grins at the deep husky voice and turns to a wide-eyed Jimin.</p>\n<p>\"He's one of the friends I told you about. He's harmless to omegas.\" </p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>Jungkook takes off out the front door and into Yoongi's waiting embrace. They clap one another's backs before Yoongi starts to inquire about what happened, only to stop and stare at the front door of the cabin.</p>\n<p>\"Who is that? I didn't smell any other presence...?\"</p>\n<p>\"That's my savior. Park Jimin. He's a scentless omega.\"</p>\n<p>\"Wow. Wait...so thats not your mate? I thought the seer said your mate was in this area?\"</p>\n<p>\"He must've been wrong. And no, not my mate, scentless omegas can't mate, remember?\"</p>\n<p>\"Hmm. Damn shame. This one\u2019s gorgeous.\"</p>\n<p>Jungkook doesn't know why but he's a little annoyed at the comment. \"Where's NamJoon?\"</p>\n<p>\"We didn't know what had happened to you so Joon went back up North to report that you'd gone missing.\"</p>\n<p>\"Aish, Yoongi. Seriously?!\"</p>\n<p>\"It's ok. We'll catch up to him if we leave now.\"</p>\n<p>Jungkook nods. </p>\n<p>\"Come, let's go say farewell to Jimin and get my weapons.\"</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>Jimin watches from his doorway as Jungkook hops up onto the horseback behind his friend Yoongi.</p>\n<p>He'd packed a few pieces of bread and cheese for the alphas and wished them a safe journey back home.</p>\n<p>As they disappear into the looming forest and he turns into his cabin again, he feels the emptiness hit him hard, a void he'd never felt until now. </p>\n<p>Even though Jungkook had been unconscious most of his time here, Jimin had started to take to having another presence in his tiny cabin. It was nice to just walk around doing his chores and talk and pretend that the other person could hear him and his questions. And now, it is over. </p>\n<p>Time to set his life back into it's normal, boring, quiet, everyday routine.</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>Jungkook closes the flap on his bag and settles down on the rented hostel cot, trying to figure out the reason for his unease. </p>\n<p>It's been thirty minutes since he and Yoongi have arrived back to their little room in the village and he's been all forms of restless, prowling around the interior, almost growling.</p>\n<p>\"Yah.\"</p>\n<p>He freezes in his spot and turns to Yoongi, realizing he\u2019d been pacing again.</p>\n<p>\"What's wrong? You've been a mess since we returned...?\"</p>\n<p>Jungkook looks at his best friend, unsure of what to say. He kind of knows why he is in this mood, but he\u2019s not entirely sure what he can do about it...yet he can\u2019t just...</p>\n<p>Jungkook stops pacing, suddenly realizing that he needs to at least ask.</p>\n<p>\"Hyung, I'll be back. Give me an hour.\" Jungkook picks up the bow and arrow set he had just laid out to clean.</p>\n<p>\"What-yah!\"</p>\n<p>Yoongi yells out, watching with wide eyes as Jungkook sprints out the door and hops onto the horse, headed back out in the direction they had just come from.</p>\n<p>\"This kid.\" he says to himself fondly.</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>Jimin closes his eyes, fear etched across his features, willing himself not to move as the huge black bear wanders up to his front door. </p>\n<p>He can't believe this is happening. After all his life of living in this cabin, a bear would now wander into his yard. A big, hungry bear.</p>\n<p>Bears this size are strong and he knows his cabin door won't stand much of a chance if the bear charges at it. Jimin gives a little prayer that it would just move on and away if it doesn't sense any movement.</p>\n<p>At that thought, he hears broken glass and knows the bear has just broken a small window with his huge paws. </p>\n<p>Clenching his eyes shut again, Jimin offers another small prayer, this time for help.</p>\n<p>He's frozen, scared shitless, wondering what to do when he hears the bear suddenly howl loudly before a loud vibrating thud thumps against his front door. His fear is coming true, the bear is charging.</p>\n<p>Jimin turns and presses his hands up against his door with all his might, a weak sob breaking out, knowing it won't hold, wondering how he is going to survive-</p>\n<p>\"Jimin!\"</p>\n<p>Jimin's eyes snap open. </p>\n<p>Jungkook?</p>\n<p>\"Jimin, are you ok? Open up!\"</p>\n<p>Scrambling now to lift up the heavy bar across his door, Jimin pushes it away with a desperate sob before tearing the door open.</p>\n<p>He gasps as he sees the huge bear, dead on its side, blocking his doorway, 4 poison arrows sticking out of its body.</p>\n<p>Jimin looks up as a shadow falls over him and he breathes out the biggest sigh of relief upon seeing a familiar face.</p>\n<p>\"Jungkook!\" </p>\n<p>Jimin backs up as Jungkook hops over the dead animal and into his cabin before his trembling legs give out and he collapses into the other's arms, unable to stop his tears.</p>\n<p>\"You're ok, shhh.\"</p>\n<p>\"I...I was sso...so scared!\" </p>\n<p>Jimin feels his big hands pat his back softly until his shaking dissipates. He follows as Jungkook backs away and pulls him further into the room to sit him on the cot before lowering down to his hunches, gripping Jimin's small hand in his.</p>\n<p>\"Jimin.\"</p>\n<p>Jimin wipes his tears and peers at Jungkook's handsome face.</p>\n<p>\"I'm leaving to go back to my pack in a bit.\"</p>\n<p>Jimin nods. He already knows this, Jungkook and Yoongi had mentioned it earlier. He wonders why Jungkook is bringing this up again.</p>\n<p>\"Jimin...come with me. With us.\"</p>\n<p>Jimin's mouth falls open, not sure he had heard correctly.</p>\n<p>\u201cWh...What?\u201d</p>\n<p>\"You said so yourself, you have no pack here, no family left, nothing. If you come with me, my pack will welcome you with open arms. We don't turn away innocent, packless wolves and there is always a need for healers.\"</p>\n<p>\"Jungkook...\" Jimin breathes out, in awe at his generosity.</p>\n<p>\"I'm...I'm a scentless omega. No one will accept me wherever I go. I'm destined to be alone-\"</p>\n<p>\"Stop. You are not. This train of thought from your idiotic old pack has poisoned your mind. Scentless, yes, but still an omega, one who deserves protection and respect from a pack.\"</p>\n<p>Jimin can't even begin to hope. \"You don't know for sure your pack will accept me. Your pack leader could even punish you and disown you for daring to bring forth an outsider!\"</p>\n<p>Jungkook breaks out into a grin, the first Jimin has seen from him. And oh, does he look handsome. His face turns youthful and cute, his eyes and nose crinkle, the smile is toothy and darling. </p>\n<p>But Jimin still doesn't find the situation funny.</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t laugh, I\u2019m serious here.\u201d He pouts. </p>\n<p>\"My father won't ever disown me, Jimin.\"</p>\n<p>Jimin's brows wrinkle in confusion...Father? Oh. Oh!</p>\n<p>\"You...you're the son of the Jeon Pack's Chief?\"</p>\n<p>\"The one and only. So you see, you will have no issues joining our pack. I promise.\"</p>\n<p>Too good. Too good to be true. Can Jimin leave behind his cabin? What about his grandmother? This is where he grew up...where he lives...with no one to care and no one to care for him. Maybe...just maybe his grandmother would understand.</p>\n<p>Jimin looks into the eyes of the alpha in front of him. He stares hard, trying to find any hint of humor or playfulness or even just plain awful lying. He sees nothing but genuine concern and that seals his fate.</p>\n<p>\"O...okay, Jungkook. I'll come with you. If you're sure-\"</p>\n<p>\"I'm sure. My pack will welcome you.\"</p>\n<p>\"I need to say good-bye to someone...may we make a stop before we head out?\"</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>The three of them had managed to catch up to Kim Namjoon, as Yoongi had predicted, by the end of their first day of traveling. Just a couple more days and they would be in Jeon territory. </p>\n<p>Jimin is both excited and nervous, having never belonged to a pack and scared of how they would react to his condition. However, he takes both Yoongi and Joon's reaction when they\u2019d learned of it to be a good indication. Joon had been impressed and intrigued, asked a few questions and offered him food before promptly starting in on stories of their pack and their village.</p>\n<p>Tonight, as they sit around the fire and enjoy their dinner of roasted rabbit and grilled turnips, he learns that Yoongi is sweet on an omega named Hoseok and Joon is mated to a female beta named SoJung.</p>\n<p>\"Jiminie, I'm so damn happy you came along. We\u2019ve never eaten so good on travels.\"</p>\n<p>Jimin smiles at the compliment from Joon, his cheeks pinkening. He isn't a warrior and the boys hadn't needed any medical attention so he had offered his cooking services so as to somehow not feel so inadequate and since learning of his talent, the boys had constantly killed fresh meat for him to prepare.</p>\n<p>After their supper, Jungkook takes the first watch, allowing Joon and Yoongi to catch up on some shut-eye.</p>\n<p>As Jimin cleans and wipes the pan he'd used to cook the turnips, Jungkook polishes his sword by the fire. Jimin sneaks a glance at him, admiring the way the firelight illuminates depths and shadows on his handsome face Jungkook is striking in a purely masculine way, virility and masculinity painting his tall form and muscular body, yet hints of boyish handsomeness traces his facial features with big, dark, doe eyes, a cute nose and a smile that is more youthful than manly. </p>\n<p>Jimin finds himself in another moment where he wishes he isn't mateless. Jimin doesn't like to dwell on things he can't have, but once in a while, yearnings like this hit and he has little power to stop it.</p>\n<p>Sure, he doesn't have all the primitive, baser desires, but he still would like to have someone to hold and comfort and have the favor returned.</p>\n<p>Gathering his courage, Jimin pointedly asks, \"Jungkook-ah, do you have a mate waiting for you back home too?\"</p>\n<p>\"No. Haven't found my omega yet.\" Jungkook doesn't stop polishing his sword nor does he look up as he answers.</p>\n<p>\"Oh.\"</p>\n<p>The chirping of night crickets and the snapping of the fire is all that can be heard for a moment as Jimin reflects on that tidbit. He can\u2019t help wondering if the Jeon Pack betas and omegas line up for Jungkook to choose.</p>\n<p>\"Before embarking on this mission, a seer passed by our village. He's been around our neighboring villages for ages and visits my parents every so often. You\u2019ll meet him someday. He'd predicted that during this journey, chances are high that I will meet my mate along the way. So far, his predictions have been false and seeing how we only have two more days before we reach home, I don't see any of it coming true.\"</p>\n<p>Jimin presses his lips together, feeling for the young warrior. His heart goes soft and he gives a tiny smile. The alpha may be a big, strong warrior, but inside, he is a romantic at heart - he\u2019s looking for that one single, special connection that wolves long for when choosing a mate. As a scentless, his grandmother never really talked about this stuff with him, but he still remembers sneaking behind her back every chance he gets when she\u2019s with clients and other old villagers, listening in on their talks and gossips about true mate bonds and wolves who even die from broken hearts.</p>\n<p>Jimin hopes for Jungkook. He\u2019s a kind person who would cater to his mate\u2019s every need. And at least he knows he has a mate out there. For Jimin, there's not even a hope.</p>\n<p>\"He did give me a warning as well,\u201d Jungkook continues, prompting Jimin to look up from his musings. \u201cThat my mate, when I do meet them, will come upon some sort of situation that will require my assistance, a life or death one.\"</p>\n<p>Jimin gasps.</p>\n<p>\"That's...kind of scary!\"</p>\n<p>Jimin feels himself fall a little bit deeper into the sparkly abyss of Jeon Jungkook's eyes as he finally looks up at him and a small smile turns his lips at the astonished expression on Jimin's face.</p>\n<p>\u201cJungkook-ah, I really hope you find them. As I am a healer, whatever you can't do, I promise to help you and your mate.\"</p>\n<p>Jungkook chuckles softly at the sweet declaration. He is endeared by this passionate omega. He can kind of see now how Jimin has survived so long being packless. He has a positive spirit that is quite infectious. Both Yoongi and Joon have already taken a liking to him, not to mention himself, and they've only known each other a matter of days.</p>\n<p>\"Go to sleep, omega. We got a long day tomorrow.\"</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>One more day. </p>\n<p>Jimin is excited. Tomorrow by noon they will be with the Jeon pack.</p>\n<p>Gathering the two pans he'd used to make their noon lunch of grilled fish and roots, he makes his way down to the little riverbed they'd passed.</p>\n<p>He makes sure to wave at Yoongi on his way away from their campsite, as requested by Jungkook whenever one of them needed to venture off.</p>\n<p> He sits down at the bank of the river and stares out into the water, taking a moment just to get lost in the calming ripples.</p>\n<p>He feels a bit guilty for leaving behind his home, his grandmother, but at the same time, he feels that this is what he needs to do. Though his condition warrants so, Jimin can't help feeling that he's just not a person built for solitude. He craves conversation, laughter, tenderness, affection. He's eager to be surrounded by children and their innocence, friendly faces and kind neighbors. He tries not to put high hopes on getting all of this with the Jeon Pack, but neither can he help his anticipatory nature.</p>\n<p>He'd grown up to understand his grandmother's protective nature and he's thankful, but at the same time, he feels he's missed out so much on not having a pack, including all the negatives.</p>\n<p>With one last sigh, Jimin stands back up and bends down to pick up the pans. He needs to wash them and head back so they can start their journey onwards.</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>Jungkook returns to the site with two freshly killed rabbits in his hands, ready for their dinner tonight.</p>\n<p>He tosses them into the leather bag hanging off his horse's saddle before turning to Joon, busy brushing his animal's rump.</p>\n<p>\"Where's Jimin?\"</p>\n<p>\"I don't know.\" He turns to Yoongi, coming up from packing their tents.</p>\n<p>\"Yoongi, where's Jimin?\"</p>\n<p>\"He went down to the river to rinse out the pans about 10 minutes ago.\"</p>\n<p>Jungkook's brows furrow and he feels a slight tickle at the back of his neck. He's probably overthinking, but he's not one to ignore his senses. Tongue in cheek and with a slight cock of his neck, he turns and heads towards the river bank.</p>\n<p>Jungkook's heartbeat trips when he sees no Jimin in sight. It escalates when he spots the two dented pans lying haphazardly on the hillside.</p>\n<p>Shit.</p>\n<p>He runs back to the other two. He'd known those were carriage wheel tracks he'd spotted earlier.</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>Jimin wipes away the tears streaming down his cheek and huddles into the corner of the dark wooden carriage as it traverses over the bumps and holes of the dirt road.</p>\n<p>He doesn't know if the alphas will realize he's gone in time, if they'd even be able to find him...</p>\n<p>Jimin had just been on his way back up the hill when he'd been grabbed from behind by 4 men, all hunters from their garb, and hauled over and thrown into this creaky wooden cart.</p>\n<p>He'd heard them mutter about getting a good price for an omega and Jimin just knew...they were going to sell him as a slave.</p>\n<p>He was so close...soooo close to belonging in a pack...maybe fitting in and finding a sense of belonging, maybe even some real friends... </p>\n<p>He should have known his curse as a scentless omega wouldn't let him.</p>\n<p>Jimin sniffles again and curls into a ball, the image of Jungkook's face flashing before his mind. His one real, true friend, snatched from him in the blink of an eye. Jimin brushes at the tears that continue to fall, wondering why life is always so unfair to him.</p>\n<p>All of a sudden, he hears shouts and screams outside but before he can react, he is thrown across the carriage as it flips over onto its side.</p>\n<p>Jimin lays there, disoriented from hitting the back of his head against the wood panel, his ears ringing, black circles crowding his vision, his last thought that death had finally come to relieve him from life.</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>Jungkook feels his heart flip at the same time the carriage cart does. Somehow, he knows Jimin is in there and he could get seriously hurt, if not already so.</p>\n<p>As Joon and Yoongi deal with the other two alpha hunters not struck by his arrows, Jungkook hops off his horse and rushes over to the upturned cart, heart in his throat.</p>\n<p>He hacks off the padlock on the door with one swipe of his sword and then proceeds to rip off the wood piece at it's rusty hinges, eyes falling on Jimin's old cape and his light blonde hair in a heap, unmoving in the back.</p>\n<p>Crawling inside, Jungkook hunches over and pulls the small, unconscious form into his arms before making his way back out and into the open air. His heart is pounding with dread, much like when he\u2019d come upon Jimin\u2019s cabin to see the huge bear pawing at his door. This same feeling had encroached upon him and refused to leave until he\u2019d made sure the omega was ok.</p>\n<p>He kneels down on the grass and pulls the fur cape away from Jimin's face, relieved at least to see no blood or visible bruises.</p>\n<p>\"Jimin? Hey, wake up...\" he gently taps the soft cheeks. \"Jiminie...?\"</p>\n<p>He breathes easier as he sees a slight fluttering of the long lashes before they open and he is staring into the silver crystalline eyes he'd been afraid he'd never see again.</p>\n<p>\"Jung-Jungkook?\" </p>\n<p>He hears the slight whisper and he calms down somewhat.</p>\n<p>\"There you are...You're ok now, I have you.\"</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>The three warriors are gathered around their small fire pit that night, Jimin sleeping in the tent under their watchful eyes.</p>\n<p>Jungkook gets up every so often to check on the small omega, to make sure he is breathing still, not yet out of the concussion zone.</p>\n<p>As he takes off to relieve himself and check again for the 3rd time in this last hour, Joon and Yoongi look at one another.</p>\n<p>They've never seen their leader so protective. Earlier, when he'd realized Jimin had been taken, he'd almost ran his horse into the ground to reach the hunters.</p>\n<p>They know Jungkook is training to become a leader for their pack and they know he will do just as well, if not better, than his father, but he is usually more private, less emotionally driven.</p>\n<p>Until today.</p>\n<p>\"That was really odd, wasn't it?\" Joon finally speaks, pushing back the thick fur hat he has on.</p>\n<p>\"Yeah.\"</p>\n<p>\"He's overprotective of Jimin, almost like Jimin is his mate...which is impossible because of Jimin's condition.\"</p>\n<p>Yoongi sighs and throws the blade of grass he'd been chewing on into the fire.</p>\n<p>\"I don't think he's attracted to Jimin that way...kind of hard for that to happen without our biological nature and scenting. I mean, face it. We\u2019re a race all about procreativity. Omegas are highly attractive due to their nurturing nature and lushness which turns our minds over to sexual pursuit. I mean, I get it, I wouldn\u2019t expect a scentless omega to be beautiful and lush either, but in the end, he\u2019s still a scentless.\u201d Yoongie leans back onto the log he had been sitting on before continuing.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe're wolves, scents are the biggest part of our mating rituals and Jimin smells like absolutely nothing so there can\u2019t be a draw there, no link. But it's definitely odd.\"</p>\n<p>Joon nods solemnly. He can't imagine not being able to smell his mate. He can usually tell what her mood is just by whatever scent she releases. Not for the first time, he feels a lot of sympathy for Jimin, a beautiful omega with no scent of his own, no scent to attract a mate, not even a way to smell other wolf\u2019s different, distinct scents.</p>\n<p>He thinks Jimin could've been a great mate for Jungkook. As a skilled healer with heart, compassion and beauty as well...they would've been a remarkable team later on in life when Jungkook takes over the pack. He's seen them together quite often this trip, Jungkook always drawn towards the younger's presence. It\u2019s definitely an oddness; Joon has known Jungkook all his life and the younger is not a talkative person. Yet, after being in Jimin\u2019s presence, he guesses he can sort of understand Jungkook - the omega has a gift for bringing out softness in people.</p>\n<p>Physically, they were as alpha and omega as any couple could be - Jungkook tall, strong and handsome, Jimin lithe, small and beautiful. </p>\n<p>Joon dwells a little on the unfairness of life for many before getting up to go feed his horse.</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>Jungkook can't help the little smile on his face as they near the last hill. Jimin is riding astride with him, dozed off, his head rolling back against his chest, hair brushing his jaw every now and then.</p>\n<p>He can\u2019t quite figure out why he is so drawn to Jimin, but he feels an intense amount of protectiveness over the small omega. Maybe it's because Jimin has had to be so strong for so long, depending on only himself...or maybe it's because he's been so mistreated in his pack.</p>\n<p>Last night, he had been in a state of worry and concern, probably stressing out his friends as well, checking on Jimin\u2019s condition. </p>\n<p>There\u2019s a state of vulnerability to the omega that plays upon his heartstrings, a softness that he hasn\u2019t ever felt with anyone else. From the very first moment, Jimin had never judged him, not even after finding out that he will be a chief in the future. He knows omegas in general are very nurturing and caring, but it goes beyond that with Jimin. He shows compassion and patience and he doesn\u2019t complain, no matter how difficult situations can be. He knows the three have been traveling at a breakneck pace to get home, yet Jimin had not said a word; no matter that he can see the tired lines around the omega\u2019s eyes. Today, he had allowed them to go at a more leisurely pace, now that they were on more familiar grounds.</p>\n<p>He tilts his head down and glances at the soft, sleeping features, the round cheeks, small nose and cute chin. Even now, a tender sense of fondness cascades over him and he involuntarily tightens his arms around the omega in a gesture he can\u2019t even fully understand.</p>\n<p>Whatever it is, Jungkook knows this protective feeling won't be going away anytime soon. He will keep doting on Jimin like the pseudo little brother he\u2019s become. </p>\n<p>He nudges the blonde softly as they hit the rise. He watches closely as his lids flutter open, not wanting to miss the revealing of the pretty silver orbs.</p>\n<p>\"Jiminie...wake up. We're home.\"</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>Jimin can't help hiding behind Jungkook's broad back, behind his furry vest, thick jacket and fur cape, as they dismount in the village's central square. He's never seen so many people gather together to welcome their own home. Children start running up to the trio and Jimin watches fondly as the alphas all make sure to pat each child's head as they move along.</p>\n<p>Stablemen come out and smile happily at them before taking the horse's tethers and leading them away to get cleaned, fed and put up.</p>\n<p>The town is lively with a few wooden cabins and lots of sturdy tents with colorful ropes and tassels as decoration. Jimin is completely charmed, giddy that he may get to call this place his home.</p>\n<p>He feels eyes on him, curious ones, and he starts getting antsy, not used to being such public spectacle without announcing his condition.</p>\n<p>He suddenly feels a heavy arm slide across his back and pull him forward comfortingly, as if Jungkook can feel his nerves as well.</p>\n<p>\"Come. We're going to see my parents. They're at my dad's counsel tent.\"</p>\n<p>Jimin almost loses his balance at the announcement but before he can do so, Jungkook is already guiding him into a forest green tasseled tent, the biggest so far, obviously belonging to the chief of the pack.</p>\n<p>\"Jungkook, welcome back.\"</p>\n<p>Jimin stands off to the side as an older, mustached Jungkook envelopes the younger Jungkook.</p>\n<p>The resemblance is too uncanny for it to be anyone other than his father. As they hug one another, Jimin looks around his surroundings, taking in the brightly decorated throws and cloth canvases covering the walls, the plush blankets and seating around the tent. Fancy carved little tables and stools are abound, showing off their wealth and status in a less elaborate ease.</p>\n<p>\"Jungkook?!\"</p>\n<p>Jimin watches as the tent flaps open and a small plump lady bustle in, her arms outstretched to hug the alpha warrior.</p>\n<p>\"Omma,\" Jungkook leans down and embraces her tightly and Jimin smiles softly. Jungkook catches his eyes and winks.</p>\n<p>\"Appa. Omma. There is someone you need to meet. He's a healer, an omega, and he has no pack.\"</p>\n<p>Jungkook beckons Jimin over and he follows the order, head bowed, nerves a mess.</p>\n<p>\"No pack?\" he hears the father\u2019s deep voice.</p>\n<p>\"Appa. This is Park Jimin. He's a scentless omega, shunned by his own pack when young. He's also a healer, just like Seokjin.\"</p>\n<p>Jimin braces himself for the unknown, the expected silent disgust and shame.</p>\n<p>He doesn't expect a soft pair of hands to cup his cheeks and lift his face up.</p>\n<p>\"You're a beautiful omega, aren't you? Don't be shy. Scentless or not, we're all still wolves. We welcome you to our pack. If our son sees good in you, we do as well.\"</p>\n<p>Jimin blinks rapidly as he feels the accumulation of tears well up. He goes for a tremulous smile as he meets the calm, reassuring gaze of the Omega Jeon.</p>\n<p>\"Omma, he also saved your son.\" Jungkook offers up cheekily, as if embarrassing Jimin is high on his list of things to further today.</p>\n<p>\"What?!\" the plump omega places a hand over her heart. \"Then you are being honored at the feast tonight!\"</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>The bonfires and fire pits are lit up, garlands of flowers and leaves are strung about the circle of their town and the villagers are emerging out of their huts and tents in colorful garments, showing off their best for the festivities of the evening.</p>\n<p>Not only will this be a welcome home ceremony for the 3 alphas, it also serves as a courting party of sorts, where shy omegas, sweet betas and strong alphas come together to flirt and blush the night away.</p>\n<p>Parents will be out with their watchful eyes and cooking skills, ready to offer food to any and all, children will be frolicking around, teasing, taunting, playing with one another.</p>\n<p>Jungkook, dressed in gray trousers, a linen peasant tunic with his thick luxurious fur thrown around his back watches the children as they run around the fire pit closest to him, giggling. Seated upon one of the thick logs set up around the area, he gratefully accepts a cup of wine from one of the older women servers and takes a big gulp.</p>\n<p>Off to the side, he sees Joon and his mate flirting and Jungkook can't help the smile creasing his face. Those two are such lovesick fools. Married for 3 years, acting still like it'd only been 3 weeks.</p>\n<p>His gaze falls on a blonde head exiting his parent's tent and his eyes widen as he takes in Park Jimin, dressed in the pretty, colorful clothing of his pack, a bright smile on his pretty face. A smile that makes Jungkook smile as well.</p>\n<p>He continues watching as Jimin bends down and allows one of the little girls to place a white flower crown on his head.</p>\n<p>Once again, Jungkook is awash in a sense of relief because Jimin had agreed to come join his pack. The omega is too compassionate a soul, has too giving of a heart to live alone in a dangerous forest. Here, even if he is unable to mate, he will at least have the company of other wolves and their children.</p>\n<p>Yoongi's words from before echo through his mind: it's a shame he can't mate...he's damn gorgeous.</p>\n<p>It truly is a shame, he thinks as he stares at the way Jimin's face lights up when he laughs, his small hands as he fixes his flower crown, the shy blush on his cheeks as someone teases him.</p>\n<p>He sees Jimin look around as if searching for someone before their eyes catch. Jimin offers a little wave, cheeks tinged in pink, his eyes disappearing with a big smile.</p>\n<p>Jungkook nods in acknowledgment, glad his mother seems to have taken Jimin under her wing. Good. No way anyone can even attempt to shun Jimin here without offending their leader.</p>\n<p>\"Stop staring.\"</p>\n<p>Jungkook grins as Yoongi plops down next to him, a goblet of wine in one hand, a chunk of bread in the other.</p>\n<p>Yoongi offers the bread hand to Jungkook and he reaches over to break off a hunk before returning his eyes back to the group of omegas.</p>\n<p>He sees now that Hoseok, a happy, red haired omega, had approached and befriended Jimin as they walk off arm in arm.</p>\n<p>He turns his head and sees his best friend eyeing them as well and he snickers. </p>\n<p>He and Yoongi grew up together and even though Jungkook is two years younger, they'd become the best of friends, practically brothers, as they played together and then trained together and now, perform missions together. There is no one Jungkook trusts more than Yoongi, besides Namjoon, who is also one of his closest childhood friends.</p>\n<p>\"How long are you two going to dance around one another?\" Jungkook asks, popping a piece of bread into his mouth.</p>\n<p>\"Just waiting...want him to make sure he knows what he's getting into if he mates with me.\"</p>\n<p>\"Please. The only other person more whipped than you is Hoseok. Stop being idiots, both of you.\"</p>\n<p>\"I'll mate when you do. How's that?\" Yoongi grins a tipsy, gummy smile at him.</p>\n<p>\"Don't wait on me, hyung. I'm not even sure I have a mate.\"</p>\n<p>\"The seer-\"</p>\n<p>\"He was wrong. We went on this mission and back and the only person we met is a scentless, mateless omega. Should I take that as a sign?\"</p>\n<p>\"Stop. You're usually not so negative. What's up with you tonight?\"</p>\n<p>\"Sorry. Been a long day.\"</p>\n<p>Yoongi offers him more bread as a peace offering and Jungkook takes it with a smile. The friends enjoy each other's company in silence for a moment.</p>\n<p>Jungkook looks around again, enjoying the happiness evident in the pack's faces as they flirt and dance and eat. </p>\n<p>Fights and disagreements over treaties and territories are plenty and common, but nights like these, when there is contentment in the air...nights like these are Jungkook's favorite. Not for the first time does he wish he had a mate to share it with instead of just friends and family.</p>\n<p>\"Jungkook-ah, is that who I think it is?\"</p>\n<p>Jungkook looks up from his wine goblet and into the direction where Yoongi is motioning to.</p>\n<p>He sees Hoseok, Jimin...and a tall, broad alpha not a part of their pack. </p>\n<p>Indeed he isn't, he is the grandson of their neighboring pack, the Shims.</p>\n<p>Jungkook doesn't like how Jimin is smiling up at Shim Wonho. He likes even less how Wonho is holding on to Jimin's hand.</p>\n<p>\"Why is Shim Wonho here?\" Yoongi asks, standing up.</p>\n<p>\"He and his grandfather are passing by, on their way to a trip out west. They just stopped by to show respect.\"</p>\n<p>Joon's voice comes from behind them.</p>\n<p>Jungkook has known Wonho from when they were young. He's never had a reason to dislike the other alpha. But right now, with Jimin's hand in his, Jungkook is finding one.</p>\n<p>\"Jungkook. Unfist your hand. He's not hurting anyone.\"</p>\n<p>Jungkook releases immediately, not even aware he had been doing so.</p>\n<p>Yoongi grins.</p>\n<p>But that grin disappears as he sees Wonho lean in and hug Hoseok. His Hoseok.</p>\n<p>\"That little-\"</p>\n<p>\"Yoongi. Stand down. Hoseok isn't yours.\" Joon, the voice of reason interjects and a fuming Yoongi stares up at him. Small he may be, but he can be quite a rabid dog when angered.</p>\n<p>\"Yet.\" Joon pacifies, causing Jungkook to almost smile. He knows Joon sometimes feels like he's their babysitter or their father. </p>\n<p>Wonho looks up, notices them and waves, unaware of the tension on this side of the fire pit.</p>\n<p>Jungkook gives a solemn nod back as Joon waves in return and Yoongi...he just continues staring.</p>\n<p>They all breathe easier when he moves away from the omegas, called back over to where their horses are tethered.</p>\n<p>\"I'm going to at least greet him, since you two numb-skulls won't,\" Joon, ever the patient, ever the intelligent, ever the peacemaker walks off, leaving Jungkook and Yoongi to stare at one another.</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>Jimin is in heaven.</p>\n<p>Or as close to it as he can get. it\u2019s been two weeks being a part of the Jeon Pack and he\u2019s never been happier. </p>\n<p>Being surrounded by people, children, pets; he's not known how much he's missed with his lonely upbringing.</p>\n<p>Most of the Jeon Pack are friendly and attentive, having set him up in his own little tent, next to their other healer, a Kim Seokjin, who is currently on loan to another pack to assist with the birthing of their chief's wife's firstborn.</p>\n<p>Knowing that Jungkook is his new chief's son, Jimin tries to stay away, knowing Jungkook has a plethora of way more important duties to attend to then conversing with him. </p>\n<p>However, to his shock and pleasant surprise, Jungkook makes it a habit to go out of his way and visit him daily, always to inquire about his settling-in.</p>\n<p>Jimin quickly attributes Jungkook's attention to the fact that he is just checking up on his welfare since he is responsible for bringing Jimin into the pack.</p>\n<p>Jimin learns from Jungkook that this season, the pack alphas are busy building a cabin for the young children to learn in, a school of sorts, and Jungkook is out with the others everyday cutting wood and carrying it and making sure orders are being carried through.</p>\n<p>On one of his many stops at Jimin's tent on his way to his own cabin, he had joined Jimin for dinner and the omega had found out that Jungkook had not had time to eat lunch that day.</p>\n<p>To repay the Alpha's attentive kindness, Jimin starts bringing a basket of fruits and berries and whatever meat he has on hand to the construction site. His plan had originally been to just leave the basket with someone there, but of course, Jungkook had spotted him immediately and came down from his perch on the roof beams.</p>\n<p>And now, a week later, Jimin is still bringing him lunch. </p>\n<p>Today, he has packed a handful of blueberries and some deer meat he'd grilled earlier. The deer meat had been kindly brought to him from Hoseok, who had gone hunting with his beta friends.</p>\n<p>Jimin has just rounded the corner shrub when he hears two betas in conversation. He smiles, about to make his presence known when he hears his name.</p>\n<p>\"...you know that he just feels all kinds of pity for Jimin because he's a scentless omega.\" </p>\n<p>Jimin freezes in his steps.</p>\n<p>\"I know, Joo-Ah. It just irks me that he doesn't accept snacks from me when I bring him berries, but he eats from Jimin's basket and even visits him.\"</p>\n<p>\"Well, Jimin is a very pretty omega, I\u2019ll admit, but he's scentless. Remember that any kind of romance between them is impossible. I think Jungkook just feels sorry for him, thus he's always nice to the omega.\"</p>\n<p>\"I know...but still... I wish he would pay attention to me too.\"</p>\n<p>\"Hanbi-ah, calm down. You know Jungkook is picky. He's looking for his one true mate and he won't settle til he finds them. Just...leave it alone and stop moping over him. Move on. Shim Wonho couldn't take his eyes off you...\"</p>\n<p>They move on and Jimin breathes a sigh of relief. He doesn't want anyone to dislike him for any reason. He especially hates having people pity him.</p>\n<p>Maybe they are right. Jimin needs to stop being dependent on others. </p>\n<p>Turning around, he heads back home, taking his basket with him, deciding that he will distance himself from Jungkook so others won't hate him.</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>\"Ok, guys. Go home. We'll play again tomorrow,\" Jungkook waves off the crew working with him and hops down from the log he was standing on. </p>\n<p>His stomach grumbles.</p>\n<p>Now that work is done for the day, he has the time to wonder why Jimin hadn't visited with food. Maybe someone in the village was sick and required his ministrations.</p>\n<p>Luckily, Namjoon had shared a bit of the meal his beta had packed for him.</p>\n<p>Wrapping his fox-haired cape over his shoulder, Jungkook heads out in the direction of Jimin's tent.</p>\n<p>Yoongi catches up to him on the path.</p>\n<p>\"Let me guess. Park Jimin's tent, right?\"</p>\n<p>Jungkook grunts at his best friend, not in the mood to be teased.</p>\n<p>\"I didn't see him come by today.\" Yoongi continues.</p>\n<p>\"Me neither. Just want to make sure he's ok.\"</p>\n<p>Yoongi is deep in thought for a moment.</p>\n<p>\"You care an awful lot about that omega.\"</p>\n<p>\"That omega has a name, Yoongi.\"</p>\n<p>Jungkook ignores the shit-eating grin Yoongi displays and keeps walking. </p>\n<p>\"He\u2019s sheltered. Innocent. Sees everything in shades of yellow. I feel responsible for him.\"</p>\n<p>\"Hmm.\"</p>\n<p>\"Hmm what?\"</p>\n<p>\"He's safe in our pack. There's no real danger or threat around, but you kinda treat him like a baby.\"</p>\n<p>Jungkook stops walking. \"A baby?\"</p>\n<p>\"Or...a potential mate.\" Yoongi gives a nonchalant shrug, biting into his pear.</p>\n<p>Jungkook turns to his friend.</p>\n<p>\"I can't mate with him, Yoongi. He's scentless, he's mateless.\"</p>\n<p>\"Ok. Just making sure you know that.\"</p>\n<p>Jungkook shakes his head. </p>\n<p>\"You know what, I'm tired. I'm heading home to sleep. Good-bye Yoongi.\"</p>\n<p>Yoongi watches as Jungkook skips out on the detour to Jimin's tent and heads up to his own. He feels a bit guilty, as if he had said something he shouldn't have. His curious teasing may have just bit him in the ass. He likes Jimin. The omega is always sweet and nice, even sharing some really great soup with him and Hoseok the other day.</p>\n<p>With a last sigh, he follows Jungkook's path towards his own cabin.</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>It's a couple days later and Jimin is really missing Jungkook's presence. He'd seen Jungkook at the morning hunting gathering as the strongest alphas were getting ready to set out on a trip to replenish their meat supply. Jimin had made sure to stay out of the way until the party was leaving before he'd finally looked for Jungkook's departing back. </p>\n<p>And all 3 long days they were gone, Jimin had worried for him. Even Hoseokie had teased him a little until the announcement of the return of the hunting party. </p>\n<p>As Jimin watches from the back of the crowd, he spots most of everyone still in one piece, a cart of rabbits, a couple deers and a huge bear, their rewards.</p>\n<p>Jimin, still shy and not feeling 100% a part of the pack yet, decides to not wait in line while the meat is being cut and distributed amongst the villagers according to hierarchy. With his supplies basket, he instead, starts to approach a couple of the alphas that had been scratched or slightly injured during the hunt.</p>\n<p>Jimin has just finished wrapping some herbal paste onto the palm of an alpha, Kang Dongwan, when Hoseok approaches him and tells him to go get in line.</p>\n<p>\"I'm ok. I still have some rabbits and deer meat from you and Sojung\u2019s generosity last time, Hoseokie.\" Jimin nods at Kang Dongwan's thank you and turns to look up at his friend. He spots Jungkook beyond, speaking with and handing over a huge chunk of deer thigh to that beta Hanbi. The same one who had been talking about him.</p>\n<p>Well, at least those two looked chummy...seems her charms are now working, Jungkook is smiling and laughing with her.</p>\n<p>\"Aissh, Jiminie! I know you're small, but that isn't going to last you the rest of the week!\" Hosek throws his hands on his hips, frowning at his stubborn friend.</p>\n<p>\"It's ok, hyung, I still have fruits and my vegetable garden is starting to thrive.\"</p>\n<p>Shaking his head, Hoseok gives up and walks back to the center ground as Jimin turns his attention to another alpha with a cut on his eyebrow.</p>\n<p>--<br>\nJungkook grins at Hanbi, a beta he's known all his life, as she tells him about the antics of her baby brother spraying water all over their father. He hands her the deer meat as she finishes and sends her off.</p>\n<p>He hasn't seen Jimin. He misses the omega's cheery disposition, his soft voice, just his company in general.</p>\n<p>He sees a flash of red hair and turns to his left to see Hoseok skipping back towards him. Behind him is Jimin, motioning for a young alpha, Yong Junhyung, to sit down on the log in front of him. He watches as Junhyung says something while Jimin bends over to apply some kind of paste on his forehead. Jimin's face breaks out into a pretty smile and Jungkook feels a flash of irritation slowly crawl up his spine.</p>\n<p>He quickly averts his gaze back to the dead animals in front of him. His gaze catches on Yoongi, who is raising an eyebrow at him, as if to let him know he'd seen the exchange. Jungkook chooses to ignore him, turning on a smile for an elder beta as she walks up to him for her share.</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>Jimin pulls his old cape over his shoulders and tucks the cloth covering his basket in securely. The evening chill is setting in and he needs to go get his fire going to warm up his little tent before his fingers get too numb.</p>\n<p>As he nears his place, he spots a big bag of something at the entrance to his tent. </p>\n<p>His steps slow as he fast approaches, his eyes curiously roving over the brown lump. Placing his basket on the ground, Jimin lifts a corner flap of the cloth around the item and gasps softly.</p>\n<p>It's a huge piece of bear meat.</p>\n<p>Jimin knows who it's from immediately, as per custom, only the warriors who took down the bear, or the chief's family, gets to partake in the delicacy.</p>\n<p>He quickly takes it inside his tent, not wanting to leave it out and give even more cause for tongues to wag.</p>\n<p>What does this mean? Jimin paces for a bit, trying to figure out why Jungkook would give him such a coveted piece of food. Especially after they had both been avoiding one another the last couple days...avoiding one another for no reason at all.</p>\n<p>Jimin slinks down onto the cushioned pillow on his floor. Absolutely no reason, indeed. They've become friends, why couldn't they continue to be friends? Friends bring each other food and look out for one another, right?</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>\"Incoming.\"</p>\n<p>Jungkook looks up from tightening a knot on the log section he is working on when he hears the word come from under Yoongi's breath. </p>\n<p>He peers up and sees Hanbi at the top of the little hill, on her way to the building site, a basket of fruits in her hand. He inwardly groans. Her scent of vanilla and lavender wafts past his nose. </p>\n<p>She'd come by yesterday as well with the same basket, but Jungkook had managed to avoid her company under the pretense that he had already shared a meal with Namjoon.</p>\n<p>He won't be so lucky today, as Hanbi had been smart enough to come before they broke for lunch. Shit.</p>\n<p>It's not that he doesn't like her, he just doesn't want to encourage her expectations \u2026 expectations that could never come to fruition.</p>\n<p>Hanbi is pretty, but he's grown up with her and she's just like a sister to him. She's not his mate, the feelings she may feel for him aren't mutual.</p>\n<p>\"Ahem. Incoming.\"</p>\n<p>\"I heard you the first-\"</p>\n<p>\"No, behind you.\"</p>\n<p>Jungkook turns around and sees Jimin coming up the opposite path, headed in this direction. Jimin is also carrying a basket. The food basket he has become accustomed to and missed seeing.</p>\n<p>Not bothering to spare Yoongi another glance, Jungkook jumps down from his perch and starts in Jimin's direction.</p>\n<p>Yoongi guffaws loudly after him, knowing it is going to be his duty to turn Hanbi away gently.</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>Jimin had decided that he would bring Jungkook food again today just to see Jungkook's reaction. He did not expect the alpha to practically run up to him, all stinky and sweaty.</p>\n<p>\"Jungkook? Is everything ok?\" he inquires as soon as the other stops in front of him.</p>\n<p>\"I'm hungry.\" </p>\n<p>Jimin's eyes widen comically before he laughs softly, and bites his lips, completely endeared by the alpha's big doe eyes. He leads the way to an empty log and plops down, handing over the basket to Jungkook as he sits down next to him.</p>\n<p>Jimin clasps his hands around his knees and takes a breath.</p>\n<p>\"Jungkook-ah...listen, thank you for the meat. You shouldn't have-\"</p>\n<p>\"You were busy tending to the wounded so I knew you weren't going to be in line. Thought I'd help you out.\"</p>\n<p>Jimin can't help thinking there's more to it than that, but decides to leave it alone.</p>\n<p>He smiles and shakes his head when Jungkook offers him a piece of seasoned deer jerky from the basket.</p>\n<p>His smile grows as two children, a brother and sister belonging to alpha Yoon Dujun, approach them.</p>\n<p>Jimin watches on fondly as Jungkook looks up and inquires if they\u2019re hungry. Both nod and he offers up the soft berries to the children, laughing when the girl says she wants meat. </p>\n<p>Jungkook hands over a piece of meat and Jimin is endeared as he notices that he\u2019d purposefully felt for and broken off the softest, most tender part of the jerky, in consideration of her baby teeth. </p>\n<p>The boy is happy with his berries and bids them goodbye before sauntering away with his sister\u2019s hand in his. </p>\n<p>Jimin peeks at Jungkook as he eats, knowing that Jungkook\u2019s future mate is going to be one fortunate omega. </p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>It's a week later when Jimin comes out of his tent at the break of dawn only to see the village alpha warriors gathering at the center square.</p>\n<p>Jimin follows the crowd, wondering what is happening.</p>\n<p>\"...the witches poisoned the water well causing the children to be sick and have left behind some of their minions in the forest to stall us while they run. Our warriors are fighting, but we are not enough by ourselves as the chief and his grandson are both away with half our warriors.\"</p>\n<p>Jimin catches this last sentence and gasps as he realizes that the alpha warriors from the Jeon pack are suiting up with weapons, preparing to go into battle to help their neighboring pack.</p>\n<p>When witches are involved, things are bloody and oftentimes, deadly.</p>\n<p>He climbs up on a log to peer over the tall shoulders of the surrounding alphas to see that it is, indeed, a Shim alpha in the middle talking with Jungkook and his father.</p>\n<p>Jimin sees that Jungkook is already suited, his sword at his side, his bow and arrows slung over one shoulder, arms crossed, listening intently as the man describes the two witches that came into their town in disguises.</p>\n<p>Jungkook barks a few orders and the stablemen hurry to bring out horses. The other pack's village is about half a day's ride out and Jimin knows he has to go too. Hopping off the log, he scrambles over to Jungkook as he prepares to get on his horse.</p>\n<p>\"Jungkook-ah! I'm coming too!\"</p>\n<p>Jungkook's eyes widen when he hears Jimin's voice. He turns around quickly, a denial on his lips.</p>\n<p>\"The children are sick, I'm a healer. Let me do my duty!\" Jimin stops right in front of the alpha, reaching out to grab one of his hands.</p>\n<p>Jungkook's lips thin out and his brows furrow, aware Jimin is right, but knowing this is not a good idea.</p>\n<p>\"No, Jimin, later, we can bring the children here-\"</p>\n<p>\"There's no time, Jungkook! Please. Let me help.\"</p>\n<p>\"The children may not have the luxury of time to make it back, Jungkook. Jimin's got a point, the other healers can always use another set of skilled hands.\" Namjoon, on his horse, stops beside them.</p>\n<p>With one decisive sigh, Jungkook calls for another horse and helps Jimin on to it.</p>\n<p>\"You are there for the children and the injured. Do not attempt anything else.\"</p>\n<p>\"Yes. I promise.\"</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>It's the third day, Jimin's back is aching, but he relentlessly works on, making herbal brews to combat tummy issues with the children and creating poultices and patching up wounded warriors.</p>\n<p>He's heard that Jungkook is doing well out there fighting, but he won't stop worrying until he can see the man for himself.</p>\n<p>That evening, as he hands over a couple of cups of hot tea to the children to quell their ailing tummies from the bad well water, he hears the greatly awaited news that the fight is over, the witches have been caught and destroyed, their minions down as well.</p>\n<p>As he changes bandages on a Shim warrior, he keeps his eyes out for Jungkook and his horse. </p>\n<p>Jimin has seen Namjoon a few times when he'd come back for supplies, but both Yoongi and Jungkook had stayed out in the field.</p>\n<p>Jimin breathes out a sigh and orders the warrior to be careful when bathing before picking up the dirty bandages and heading out back to burn them.</p>\n<p>As he drops the bandages into the fire pit, he looks up and his jaw drops as he spots Jungkook, astride his horse, come up the rise, Yoongi and Namjoon flanked on either side.</p>\n<p>Everything fades as he sees the trickle of blood on Jungkook's cheek, his one hand wrapped up in a makeshift bandage.</p>\n<p>Jimin takes off in a run, eager to make sure there are no other serious injuries on him.</p>\n<p>Jungkook has just handed over the reigns of his horse when Jimin's small body slams against him from behind. Jimin see's the surprise on his face as he quickly turns around, his eyes widening when he sees the sparkle of tears in the omega's eyes.</p>\n<p>\"Hey, hey, don't cry. I'm all in one piece, promise.\"</p>\n<p>\"I'm just glad to see you.\"</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>Jimin wraps the bandage around the cut on Jungkook's palm and knots it quickly, trimming off the excess with a quick rip.</p>\n<p>The big alpha is sound asleep, finally, after Jimin had dosed him with a sleeping concoction so he can let his body rest properly.</p>\n<p>His eyes fall upon the bigger mark on Jungkook's chest and though it isn't serious, he still worries. He finds himself even wishing Jungkook would hurry and find his mate so that when he gets hurt like this again in the future, they can further aid in rushing the healing process.</p>\n<p>Saliva from one's true mate greatly heals a wound, changing the healing process from weeks to mere days. </p>\n<p>With one last look at Jungkook, Jimin stands up and stretches. Much as he hates to leave, he, himself, needs some sleep as well.</p>\n<p>On his way out of the medical tent, he stops to let another healer know he is leaving to take a rest. The healer wishes him a good sleep before heading inside to administer more aid. Jimin quickly picks up a red apple from the basket by the door and makes his way out. </p>\n<p>He enters the makeshift tent on the other side of the grounds, set up for the healers to rest in between administering aid. He enters his usual little closed off section in the back and bites into his juicy apple as he sits down on his cot to slide off his boots. </p>\n<p>The juice from the apple trickles down the corner of his mouth and Jimin wipes at it before standing back up to take off his cape. He's just untied the string when a wave of nauseous hits him so hard he doubles over. </p>\n<p>Jimin shakes his head and stumbles over to brace his hand on the small table in front of him. Everything in his vision is suddenly twirling...spinning brightly...he feels his knees give out and then...total blackness.</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>Jungkook stirs as the sunlight hits his face.</p>\n<p>All around him he hears busy bustle as the warriors from his pack prepare to go back home, back to their families.</p>\n<p>Jungkook is thankful the whole ordeal hadn't killed any of the wolves. Wounds, major and minor were plenty, but they would all heal.</p>\n<p>He sits up and swings his legs over the cot, eager to see Jimin and ask him why he'd felt the need to knock him out with a sleeping potion. He knows because he feels all sorts of groggy still, an effect that usually comes with such drugs.</p>\n<p>He inquires with a Shim pack healer and he directs Jungkook to another sectioned tent on the opposite side of this compound.</p>\n<p>Outside, he passes by many other wolves who all pause to thank him. Jungkook waves off their gratitude with small smiles and continues to his destination.</p>\n<p>He enters the big tent and, not for the first time, wishes Jimin had a scent just so he could smell him instead of having to ask for directions. After inquiring, a few other healers direct him to the far back right corner.</p>\n<p>He comes upon Jimin's small personal section and calls through the flap.</p>\n<p>\"Jimin, are you awake?\"</p>\n<p>Hearing nothing, he tries again.</p>\n<p>\"Jiminie?\"</p>\n<p>Silence. </p>\n<p>He must still be sleeping, Jungkook surmises. He is about to leave and let Jimin catch up on his rest when he feels an odd prickle at the back of his neck. Jungkook turns back to Jimin's door flap.</p>\n<p>\"Jimin, I'm coming in.\" </p>\n<p>Jungkook pushes open the flap and lets his eyes adjust to the dimness. He automatically picks up a peculiar scent, causing his senses to suddenly tingle in concern. The cot against the wall is empty and the small space seems unoccupied.</p>\n<p>\"Jimin? Are you in here? Ji-\"</p>\n<p>Jungkook's booted toe hits something on the ground. Stepping back he bends down and picks it up. A half eaten apple.</p>\n<p>Jungkook brings it to his nose and the foul odor hits him so hard his eyes water.</p>\n<p>Poison. </p>\n<p>No.</p>\n<p>Panicking, Jungkook looks down, eyes searching until they finally spot Jimin laying on the hard floor behind a small table, palms up, unmoving.</p>\n<p>\"No...Jiminie.\" Jungkook hurriedly pushes the table out of the way and kneels down, immediately hiking a hand under the omega's neck and feeling for a pulse.</p>\n<p>He finds none.</p>\n<p>\"Jimin...no, Jimin...\"</p>\n<p>Jungkook hugs Jimin's limp form against his chest, praying that Jimin is okay, just deeply sleeping.</p>\n<p>But he is a warrior. His mind may refuse to acknowledge it, but his eyes know death when he sees it.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>-- End Part I --</p>\n<p>-- Part II --</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Yoongi settles down next to his best friend on the log bench propped outside Jimin's neat, clean tent.</p>\n<p>He pats Jungkook's back in a comforting gesture. He doesn't know the significance of the bond between the two, but he's seen enough to know that Jungkook's friendship with the scentless had been different.</p>\n<p>Yesterday, when Jungkook had carried out a lifeless Jimin from the tent with unshed tears in his eyes, Yoongi had almost cried as well. He'd never seen so much anguish. They'd all found out that the apple Jimin had bitten into had been poisoned by the witches as well, set in the basket along with other tainted items stationed at the front tent entrance to be burned later. Jimin, as a scentless, had been unable to detect the alarming aroma.</p>\n<p>Jungkook had insisted on bringing Jimin back home with them, to be cremated properly. Everyone in the pack had readily agreed.</p>\n<p>He had ridden with Jimin's cold, pale, limp body rolled up in thick fur the whole half-day journey, refusing to stop even once.</p>\n<p>Namjoon had ridden ahead to alert the villagers of the death and everyone had had tears in their eyes when they'd seen Jungkook enter the village.</p>\n<p>Though short, Jimin's presence had really made an impact, his always ready smile, his helpful manners, his consideration, his attention...it is a void even Yoongi will feel.</p>\n<p>Hoseok had cried hard against his shoulder earlier until he'd finally fallen asleep from exhaustion. Only then had Yoongi come out to find his best friend...exactly where he'd known him to be.</p>\n<p>Jungkook's mother and a few other older omegas are currently inside Jimin's home, bathing his body, prepping him and dressing him in thick furs and jewelry for the cremation. The belief amongst their pack is to cremate one with luxury so the items can be used it to pay his way into heaven.</p>\n<p>The pyre is being built in the center square, overseen by the Chief.</p>\n<p>Jungkook has been extremely quiet the entire day, mourning in his own way and now, as Yoongi is trying to figure out what to say to his friend, the tent flap opens behind them and the omegas all pile out. They both stand up mannerly.</p>\n<p>Jungkook's mother hugs her son tightly with tears in her eyes before turning to and giving Yoongi one as well.</p>\n<p>\"Go say your farewells, son. They should be preparing to light up soon.\"</p>\n<p>Yoongi wraps an arm around the omega's shoulders and draw her away, giving Jungkook some privacy.</p>\n<p>Jungkook emanates a sad sigh under his breath before entering Jimin's humble abode. It's a tiny tent, fit for one person only, but he had been so exuberantly happy upon getting it. He'd spent days cleaning and organizing and Jungkook suddenly feels bad he'd not stepped foot in it enough.</p>\n<p>Jimin's cot has been pulled away from against the wall and placed in the center where he is now laying, covered in the luxurious fur and jewelry his mother had bestowed upon him since Jimin had not had any of his own. There are lit candles all over his little tent, causing a glow around him. A glow that could never match Jimin's natural one.</p>\n<p>Jungkook pulls a small stool over, probably used by Jimin to reach for items on the high shelf, and sits down next to the omega.</p>\n<p>The air is quiet and solemn, as if death itself is mourning as well, reluctant to take away such a precious being. His eyes fall upon Jimin\u2019s still face and he takes a moment to just admire him, beautiful and lovely, even in death. His blonde hair is soft and shiny, the same condition in death as it had been in life, his lashes, long and supple as they lay against his soft cheeks. Everything almost looks the same, as if Jimin is truly just slumbering. And Jungkook wishes with everything he has that that was a truth.</p>\n<p>He reaches out and takes Jimin's small, cold hand in his own, staring at it, rubbing his thumb against the smooth skin. Such tiny hands that were so capable, so full of help and compassion and willingness. Jimin may have been small in form and stature, but Jungkook is aware of how big his heart is, how much he had enjoyed living, learning, thriving in his new atmosphere. A drop of moisture splinters on Jimin\u2019s cold hands and he realizes it's a lone tear from his own eyes.</p>\n<p>He feels a semblance of guilt for convincing Jimin to come with him to his village. For allowing the omega to go onto the battleground, for failing to protect him.</p>\n<p>Jungkook clears his throat and raises sparkling eyes to the face of the still form.</p>\n<p>\"I'm not a person good with words, Jiminie. I've never been. But somehow, after meeting and befriending you, I didn't mind talking, didn't mind listening. For some reason, you bring out the good things in me, things I never knew I had, things I just never felt a need to let anyone else in on.\"</p>\n<p>As if unable to help himself, Jungkook reaches out and traces a finger along the cold, smooth cheeks, feeling the velvety texture under the pad of his finger.</p>\n<p>\"Your presence in my life was too short. I can\u2019t help but think that there had to have been an important reason why we crossed paths. It\u2019s a shame we didn\u2019t have the time to figure out what it was. Our friendship, though timed, will never be forgotten. A part of me kind of wishes I'd never asked you to come back with me...maybe then, you wouldn't be in this condition. But another part is forever glad to have met you, fleeting though it be.\"</p>\n<p>Jungkook remains silent for a minute, watching the firelight flicker and cast shadows over Jimin\u2019s pretty features...features he can only ever see in his memory after tonight. The empty silence becomes unbearable and he finally stands up, gently placing Jimin's hand back on his tummy, over the other hand.</p>\n<p>\"Farewell, my dear friend. I hope you meet your grandmother up there. Tell her about me. One day, I\u2019d like to meet her as well,\" he murmurs, running his palm over Jimin's soft bangs to reveal his forehead. He bends down slightly and presses his lips against the cold skin, before straightening back up and gazing down softly one last time at the still features, memorizing as many details as possible of the loveliness and locking them away. With one last run of his finger down the tip of Jimin's small nose, he leaves.</p>\n<p>He misses the slight flickering of lashes.</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>Jungkook heads to the center square and joins the villagers and his friends.</p>\n<p>\"The seer is back. I just saw him go inside your father's tent.\" Yoongi murmurs as Jungkook comes to stand next to him to stare at the woodwork. The framing for the pyre is set, ready for Jimin's body to be laid into. A few villagers are scattered around, gathering twigs to drop into the pyre, others are setting up tables and prepping food for the cremation ceremony.</p>\n<p>The seer.</p>\n<p>Jungkook has been waiting for him to come back, to explain why he'd sent Jungkook on a crazy mission that got him nowhere near meeting his destined mate. Instead, he'd managed to get injured and bring back home a friend only to have to now put him to rest. Nothing is making sense but the seer sure seems to have some kind of impeccable timing.</p>\n<p>A gust of wind suddenly picks up and a strong scent of orange blossom assail his senses out of nowhere. Jungkook\u2019s body freezes and he cants his head curiously as the scent wafts over him, causing his bloodstream to race and all of his senses to perk up. No one in his village has this scent.</p>\n<p>But Jungkook knows it, has smelled it, felt it in his blood, his dreams. His skin tingles, thrumming as if on high energy, his arms suddenly covered in goosebumps, his nape tingling.</p>\n<p>He hears a loud gasp in front of him and looks up to see Hoseok staring directly behind him, mouth open, eyes wide, face frozen as if he is seeing a ghost.</p>\n<p>\"Holy shit.\"</p>\n<p>He hears Yoongi breathe out beside him and Jungkook spins around quickly, only to have his jaw drop at the vision he sees.</p>\n<p>What the fuck.</p>\n<p>Jimin.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s standing at the path\u2019s entrance into the town square, alone, dressed in his cremation finery, staring back at everyone with confusion in his eyes, the wind tousling his blonde locks.</p>\n<p>The small crowd around Jungkook have frozen in stillness, not sure what to make of the situation. Fear, surprise, shock...Jungkook can feel the emotions chase throughout the villagers.</p>\n<p>His feet start moving of their own accord, towards Jimin, afraid to blink, afraid it is all just his imagination.</p>\n<p>As he gets nearer, the orange blossom scent intensifies, surrounding his senses, almost dizzying in his head.</p>\n<p>\"Jimin...you're...alive?\" he whispers, stopping within reach, eyes roaming all over the younger male in disbelief before settling on the silver eyes.</p>\n<p>\"Jungkook-ah...what's going on?\" Jimin reaches out and touches his bare arm and Jungkook feels the warmth all the way down to his toes.</p>\n<p>It's real. He's real.</p>\n<p>\"Jimin...what...you...Jimin!\" Jungkook stops his incoherent stammering, unable to hold off any longer from pulling the omega into his arms and burying his face into his shoulder, a force of relief flooding through his being, eviscerating his grief. He doesn't know what\u2019s happening...what's going on...but Jimin is alive...and Jimin smells like the orange blossoms that are always constant in his dreams. Jungkook knows this scent well...he\u2019s been searching for it for so long...because it belongs to his true mate.</p>\n<p>Somehow...Jimin is his omega.</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>Jimin stands stock still in shock as Jungkook envelopes him, the strong scent of cedar and pine trees over frozen lakes charging through his senses.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s never smelt this on Jungkook, and never anything quite so strong before either. Has the man been bathing in the freezing lake?!</p>\n<p>He\u2019d woken up a minute ago from the deepest slumber he\u2019s ever had only to look around in confusion, wondering why his tent is setup up like it is for dead people, why his skin is tingling, his senses feeling as if on a slow burn, yet his body feeling the most enervated he\u2019s ever felt it to be.</p>\n<p>No matter the reason, Jimin finds that he suddenly can\u2019t stop sniffing the alpha, raising on tiptoes, wrapping his arms securely around Jungkook\u2019s trim waist, digging his nose into his neck and taking in huge gulps of air. It\u2019s exhilarating, addicting and comforting all at once and he just wants to wrap the scent around him and dance in it for all eternity.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo you\u2019re the one causing all this commotion.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin and Jungkook break apart to see a small, old man with foggy blue eyes, wrapped in layers of fur standing beside them.</p>\n<p>The seer.</p>\n<p>\u2014</p>\n<p>\u201cGive me your hand, child.\u201d</p>\n<p>They\u2019re back inside Jimin\u2019s tent, Jimin sitting down on a stool, the seer seated in front of him on the wooden cot. Jungkook hadn\u2019t let go of Jimin, whispering to him as they\u2019d returned to his tent that the villagers are all in shock because everyone had thought him to be dead after he\u2019d bitten into that poison apple. Jimin remembers biting into the fruit...but nothing after that. He shivers a little at the thought that\u2019d been dead...and feels Jungkook\u2019s hands rub his shoulders in comfort as he hovers over his back, somewhat protectively, to which Jimin doesn\u2019t fully understand why.</p>\n<p>However, he still finds himself looking up at Jungkook for direction at the seer\u2019s edict. At Jungkook\u2019s nod, Jimin rests his hand, palm up, on the seer\u2019s small, wrinkled hand.</p>\n<p>The seer starts to chant softly and Jimin finds his eyes closing of their own volition as visions and dreams start entering his focus.</p>\n<p>He sees a baby...then two males, one beta, the other omega, doting on the child...then it\u2019s only the omega with the child...the menacing faces of two witches appear...there's blood, gore, lots of it...he feels death travel through his veins...now just one witch is standing over the baby, cackling...his grandmother!...the red apple...he sees himself falling into death ... Jungkook...Jungkook is catching him, holding him...</p>\n<p>Jimin\u2019s eyes snap open and he gasps audibly, falling backwards, only to be caught against Jungkook\u2019s broad chest as his hands come up and soothe over Jimin\u2019s tense shoulders.</p>\n<p>The seer\u2019s eyes are still closed and he keeps them so until Jimin has gathered his senses and stopped shaking, half buried in Jungkook\u2019s chest and fur cape.</p>\n<p>He takes deep gulps of breath at Jungkook's directions, finding that once again, the alpha's scent is offering him such an immense amount of comfort.</p>\n<p>\u201cDid you see everything, Jimin?\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin shakes his head at the seer. \u201cNot really...just...odd bits and pieces.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou were the baby. The beta and omega you saw were your parents. Your beta father killed a witch\u2019s mate by accident and then your parents passed before she could seek her revenge on them. So, she took it out on you, casting a spell over you so that you would be unable to find your mate. But like all witch's spells, yours can be broken with the right antidote.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut...how...how does this explain my death and revival?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSeems the witch who cast her spell on your apple is the same one who did so to your omega instincts. Whatever happened to break the spell of one, broke them both.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin, wide-eyed and still ensconced in Jungkook\u2019s embrace can only stare at the seer in shock.</p>\n<p>\u201cSeer, are you saying that Jimin isn\u2019t a scentless?\u201d Jungkook manages to ask.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou tell me, Jungkook. Is he not?\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin is confused on why he is asking Jungkook, but he turns around anyway to see the alpha give a single, impassive nod.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe never was one. He\u2019s a regular omega, just with a spell blocking his scent and omega abilities. Now that it\u2019s broken, all his natural instincts will return to normal, as it already has started. His natural scent has already emerged, has it not, Jungkook?\u201d</p>\n<p>Again, another impassive nod.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd omega, the way your nose was buried in Jungook\u2019s neck earlier explains that your sense of smell has heightened and further developed, right?</p>\n<p>Jimin flushes hotly, suddenly embarrassed and shy that the seer had caught his action in such an intimate moment.</p>\n<p>\u201cSorry to intrude, Jungkook, but your dad needs you for a minute,\u201d Namjoon sticks his head inside the tent to say.</p>\n<p>Jungkook nods and slowly, reluctantly, slides his arms off Jimin's shoulders.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll be right back.\u201d He whispers before swiftly turning away. Jimin gives a little nod and watches him disappear behind the flap before turning back to the old man.</p>\n<p>\u201cSeer. Are you serious about me being normal? I...I won\u2019t die young and mateless?\u201d</p>\n<p>The seer chuckles.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou will not die young. As for your mate...he\u2019s going to be mighty protective of you for a while - he almost lost you there. So mind him and be patient if he gets a little too smothering.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat...wait...how do you know that?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYour mate just walked out of here with heavy steps. He\u2019s obviously averse to being away from you, even for just a moment.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Jimin\u2019s eyes widen. \u201cAre you...insinuating that Jungkook is my ... my mate?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s an obvious discernment. When you smelled him earlier, it brought you a sense of well-being, right? A feeling like no other, as if you can\u2019t bear to be apart from it, correct? He\u2019s responding to you the same way. The connection has been found and cemented. It\u2019s always been you. Even when you were considered a scentless, you should\u2019ve felt the palpable draw.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin\u2019s cheeks burn. Because he had felt it. He\u2019d felt their chemistry from the second he\u2019d laid eyes on Jungkook in the forest back in his village. But his condition had held him back.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m absolutely favorable to the aspect that Jungkook broke that spell. A true mate\u2019s kiss or touch may have done so. That hateful witch knew exactly what she was planning - if you were considered scentless, your true mate could never find you, could never bestow that affection to which can sever her hex. She just didn't expect true love to be stronger than her evilness.\u201d</p>\n<p>Everything starts making sense to Jimin. He's still full of questions, but before he can begin to inquire with the seer, Jungkook enters the tent again. Jimin finds that he has a hard time meeting the other\u2019s eyes, now that he knows they're mates.</p>\n<p>\u201cI explained to my father that you were just poisoned, Jimin. He\u2019s reassuring the villagers that everything is ok and he\u2019s turning this night of mourning into one of happiness. They\u2019re starting celebrations. And seer,\u201d Jungkook turns to the old man.</p>\n<p>\u201cAppa wants to see you, drink with you before you leave tomorrow.\u201d</p>\n<p>The seer nods and gets up slowly with Jungkook\u2019s help before making his way to the entrance.</p>\n<p>\u201cLet's go, I can't ever say no to a drink,\u201d he chuckles gleefully before taking his leave.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe festivities will begin soon and the villagers are eager to see and talk to you, to be reassured of your well being. Hoseok is dying to come in to visit so I'll leave you with him.\u201d Jungkook says, catching Jimin\u2019s eyes. But he doesn\u2019t move.</p>\n<p>Jimin decides to take the initiative and stands up, walking over, slowly reaching out and softly grasping one of Jungkook\u2019s big hands in his smaller ones.</p>\n<p>\u201cJungkook-ah,\u201d he begins, looking up into the sparkling dark eyes. \u201cThank you, seriously. I\u2019m not sure what you did...but you somehow broke the spell.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jungkook's brows shoot up.</p>\n<p>\u201cI'm not sure you can credit me with that...all I did was talk to you a bit...and kiss you good-bye.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin\u2019s mouth drops open.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou...kissed me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOn the forehead.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMaybe...I think that's what broke it. A kiss from...\u201d Jimin drifts off, bites his lip, and averts his eyes, not sure if he should repeat what the seer had said, not sure if Jungkook even wants him as a mate...</p>\n<p>\u201cFrom your true mate, hmm?\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin\u2019s eyes snatch back up to Jungkook's just before he\u2019s hauled into strong arms, against a hard chest.</p>\n<p>\"I've been searching for you a long time...and you've been under my nose all this while.\"</p>\n<p>Jimin's eyes flutter a few times, the intoxicating pull of Jungkook's scent permeating his senses, bringing forth an awareness he's never before felt, a sense of calm and protection and affection. His eyelids lower as Jungkook tilts his chin down and presses their lips together softly in a chaste, unhurried, kiss.\u00a0</p>\n<p>His mind faintly registers that he\u2019s kissing Jungkook. They\u2019re kissing. He\u2019s feeling like there are butterflies in his tummy and their wings are flapping and fluttering at an incomprehensible speed.</p>\n<p>As Jungkook moves back slightly, Jimin can\u2019t stop the little mewl of protest that escapes his lips, only to burn bright red as the euphoric cloud above his head disperses. He hears his alpha chuckle before he dips down again and rubs his nose softly against Jimin\u2019s own...brushing it tenderly along his cheeks, tracing a line down his neck, nuzzling into his shoulder.</p>\n<p>Jimin is unsure what is going on, but he\u2019s suddenly feeling very relaxed, languid and satisfied, the butterflies in his tummy flapping their wings at a speed that is now lax, yet steady and sound, as if he is high on some calming aphrodisiac.</p>\n<p>\u201cI don't want to let go...ever. But Hoseok is waiting and we have a celebration to attend to. We'll talk later.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jungkook whispers before backing away and at the door flap, he sends back a wink before disappearing out of the tent.</p>\n<p>\u201cJIMINIEEE!\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin's hammering heart slows down and he giggles as his loud friend flies in through the tent flap with arms wide open, ready to embrace him.</p>\n<p>Hoseok stops immediately though, a funny smile suddenly crossing his face.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh my god. Jungkook\u2019s possessive ass wasted no time, did he?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHuh?\u201d Jimin is confused as he watches his friend wrinkle his nose distastefully.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe scented you. His pheromones are everywhere. You smell just like him now!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u2014</p>\n<p>It's quieting down, practically dawn now and most of the villagers have gone to sleep or have fallen asleep in drunken stupors at the center square.</p>\n<p>Jimin hugs Hoseok at his friend's tent before wishing him goodnight and heading down to his own place.</p>\n<p>Jungkook had left to take his father back to his cabin and Jimin had chosen this time to leave the celebration as well, suddenly tired and drained from the eventful day.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s still absolutely overwhelmed that his whole life had been a lie. He\u2019s as normal as normal could be...he possesses all the instincts he\u2019s always wanted. And his mate is Jeon Jungkook. That is probably the most unbelievable pill for him to swallow.</p>\n<p>He's in his tent, dressed in his tunic and wide leg pants, folding up the luxurious fur coat to return to Jungkook's mom when the freshness of cedar and pine evades his senses heavily. His elation over not being a scentless is amazing, yet almost inconceivable after having lived the life he has.</p>\n<p>Jimin had been ecstatic over the ability of being able to discern the different scents of wolves. He'd spent a good majority of the celebration just hugging people and learning their personal scents. Well, more so hugging the betas and omegas. The other alphas, most specifically the unmated ones, kept their distance, having smelled the overwhelmingly possessive scent of Jungkook on Jimin\u2019s person.</p>\n<p>\"Jimin.\"</p>\n<p>\"Yes?\"</p>\n<p>Jimin turns around as the flap opens and Jungkook enters his tent, a huge dark gray and white striped fur in his hands. He can\u2019t help thinking that the alpha looks even more massive and broad standing inside the tiny little tent.</p>\n<p>\"Hi.\"</p>\n<p>Jimin finds himself blushing just at that simple greeting. He lowers his eyes and his hands shake a little as he picks up the fur coat he'd just folded. He walks over to Jungkook with it, a little unsteady, a lot shy.</p>\n<p>\"Here you go. Please return that to your mom and thank her for her kindness-\"</p>\n<p>\"It's yours. She wants you to keep it.\"</p>\n<p>\"What?\"</p>\n<p>Jimin looks up at Jungkook's interruption, a stupefied expression on his face. This fur is ridiculously plush. Too much of a luxury for him.</p>\n<p>\"Omma says she wants you to keep it.\"</p>\n<p>\"What...why? It's beautiful. She shouldn't just give away something this luxurious-\"</p>\n<p>\"Jimin.\"</p>\n<p>Jimin hushes and looks up at Jungkook.</p>\n<p>\"That particular fur she had originally made as a gift for her son's mate. And now that he's found his mate, she feels it\u2019s in the right hands.\"</p>\n<p>It takes Jimin a minute to digest what Jungkook has just said.</p>\n<p>\"And this,\" Jungkook places the gray and white folded lynx fur piece in his hands on top of the one in Jimin's hands.</p>\n<p>\"This one I've been saving for you. It's a hooded cape, fashioned from my first kill when I was younger.\"</p>\n<p>Jimin blinks a few times, overwhelmed by everything, a sense of shyness emerging at the telling offer, at the obvious pride and affection in Jungkook's voice.</p>\n<p>They stare at one another a long moment before Jungkook reaches back over, now removing the furs from Jimin's hands and transferring them onto the cot beside them.</p>\n<p>Jimin\u2019s bottom lip drops open in soft surprise as Jungkook encircles his wrists with his big hands and tugs him forward into his warm embrace.</p>\n<p>\"I don't think you are aware of how excited and relieved I am to find you alive and well...and to know that you're my mate...I can't even begin to describe the satisfaction blooming within me.\" he whispers into Jimin's ears as he dips his head to inhale the heady aroma that belongs to him wholly.</p>\n<p>\"You...are you sure?\" Jimin swallows thickly, still in disbelief.</p>\n<p>Jungkook pulls back to look into Jimin's face at his confused tone.</p>\n<p>\"Am I sure...?\"</p>\n<p>\"That you want me as your mate?\"</p>\n<p>Jungkook grins and chucks Jimin tenderly under his little chin.</p>\n<p>\"The whole time you were considered scentless, I had so many thoughts of why I was so attracted to you. You don\u2019t understand the turmoil I was going through, trying to figure out why I was so drawn to you, even without a scent. I even went so far as to think of that attraction as a familial bond in trying to make some sense of it. I think our wolves knew they were meant to be together, even if it took us a little longer.\"</p>\n<p>Jimin laughs softly, his hands coming up to flatten on Jungkook's chest.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He suddenly gasps as he feels the slight lump of the cloth bandage.</p>\n<p>Jungkook raises a questioning brow at him.</p>\n<p>\u201cI...I\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTell me.\u201d Jungkook urges when Jimin\u2019s cheeks flare up and he stops stammering.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019d like to...like to help heal you...if I may...here.\u201d Jimin stumbles shyly over his words as he places a flat palm over the wound on Jungkook\u2019s chest.</p>\n<p>\u201cHelp heal\u2026?\u201d Jungkook is confused for two seconds. And then he breaks out into the biggest, toothiest grin. He knows Jimin\u2019s intentions are out of nothing but concern and care, all of which he has the utmost appreciation for, but it still does little to deter him from thinking otherwise.</p>\n<p>\u201cI want you to heal faster...I \u2026I don't like to see you in any kind of pain.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wordlessly, Jimin watches as Jungkook backs away and start to peel off his coat and then his vest, dropping them to the ground. He pulls the hem of his shirt out of his trousers and lifts the material over his head, tossing it down to join the growing pile on the ground.</p>\n<p>Now topless with just the bandage wrapped over his wound, he sits down on Jimin\u2019s cot and stares at him, expectantly, almost daringly.</p>\n<p>Jimin averts his gaze from the strong, bare chest and, with flushed cheeks and heated ears, bends down to pull out the pair of shears from his basket before slowly walking behind Jungkook. His hand shakes a little out of nervousness as he slides a finger under the knotted cloth and snips at it, allowing it to unravel little by little.</p>\n<p>Jimin has no idea why he volunteered, he doesn\u2019t even know how to go about it. He\u2019s heard his grandmother tell others to just make sure there is thorough saliva coating the wound and the healing effect should start happening instantaneously.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s about to lick Jungkook. On his beautiful, broad chest.</p>\n<p>Dear God.</p>\n<p>\u2014</p>\n<p>Jungkook sits perfectly still, still unable to believe his shy little omega has offered to lick his wound.</p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t know how he\u2019s going to bear it. Just imagining Jimin\u2019s small, pink tongue lapping at his skin\u2026</p>\n<p>He blinks and swallows, staring at the empty wall in front of him. He\u2019s eager to ask Jimin to move out from here, to live with him in his cabin that he had built with his own two hands. He wants to see his omega anytime of the day, all day, everyday. But he tells himself to set a pace.</p>\n<p>He feels soft hands on his shoulder, removing the last of the cloth.</p>\n<p>\u201cLie down.\u201d</p>\n<p>He hears the soft command and complies, a small smile on his lips as a whiff of orange blossoms pervades his senses.</p>\n<p>He watches Jimin as he diligently cleanses the wound of the poultice he\u2019d spread on, taking extra care to not rub too hard with his cloth. When he is done, he finally raises shy eyes to meet Jungkook\u2019s.</p>\n<p>\u201cCan you close your eyes? Please?\u201d</p>\n<p>Jungkook smiles softly at the shy request. It\u2019s probably for the best anyway, he thinks, complying yet again.</p>\n<p>He may not be able to see, but that doesn\u2019t stop him from feeling Jimin\u2019s constant presence, over him, beside him, all over him. He\u2019s always been attuned to the omega, but his awareness has been turned up a notch now, knowing that this person is his mate, that they share a connection no one else does.</p>\n<p>This is, quite frankly, his last thought before his brain shuts down and dissolves into mush as he suddenly feels a warm wetness over his open skin.</p>\n<p>He draws in a deep breath and holds it as he feels the smooth drag of Jimin\u2019s wet tongue over the bottom of his wound, working his way up the cut slowly, methodically...erotically.</p>\n<p>Jungkook wills himself not to move, not to open his eyes, not to touch Jimin because this healing session would change to another kind of session altogether if he does any of those things.</p>\n<p>He thinks about his parents.</p>\n<p>Jimin\u2019s small tongue tickles slightly.</p>\n<p>His childhood.</p>\n<p>He feels the slight brushing of plump lips.</p>\n<p>Yoongi.</p>\n<p>The lips are soft, wet.</p>\n<p>Namjoon.</p>\n<p>Jimin balances a small, soft hand on his belly.</p>\n<p>His horse.</p>\n<p>Jimin\u2019s mouth moves entirely too close to his nipple.</p>\n<p>\u201cDid it hurt?\u201d</p>\n<p>Jungkook\u2019s eyes open at the small question and he sees Jimin peering at him worriedly.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo. Why?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYour brows were furrowed so hard...it looked almost like you were in pain.\u201d</p>\n<p>It takes Jungkook everything he has to not laugh. Oh, he\u2019s in pain, alright. Just not the kind Jimin is worrying about.</p>\n<p>\u201cOhhh...it\u2019s already scabbing down here at the bottom and the top where the cuts are the thinnest\u2026\u201d Jimin murmurs softly, rubbing the pad of his thumb softly against the area.</p>\n<p>Jungkook quickly grabs Jimin\u2019s wrist.</p>\n<p>\u201cThank you, Jimin, but let\u2019s finish up. I can\u2019t take much more of this.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin looks at him with questioningly wide eyes.</p>\n<p>Jungkook glances down and swiftly nods, indicating his nether regions and innocent Jimin\u2019s eyes follow his movements only to blush redder than a strawberry when he sees the burgeoning tent.</p>\n<p>He quickly stands up and walks away, leaving Jungkook to put on his clothes again and calm himself down.</p>\n<p>As soon as he finishes, Jungkook strides forward and wraps his arms tightly around his small omega, bending down and planting a soft kiss on the side of his neck.</p>\n<p>\"What do we do now?\" Jimin inquires, completely new to this.</p>\n<p>\"Now, you get ready to be thoroughly courted.\"</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>\"Didn't I tell you your mate would be found on this journey? And had I not told you that there would be a life or death situation?\"</p>\n<p>Jungkook muffles a grin the next morning as he loads the seer's wooden carriage with a lavish fur blanket to thank him for sharing his predictions.</p>\n<p>\"It\u2019s always good to see you.\"</p>\n<p>The seer chuckles and pats Jungkook on the shoulder before he climbs onto his wagon and signals his driver to move on out.</p>\n<p>Jungkook is still in a certain state of disbelief over all the things that have happened the last few days. It'd been non-stop...yet Jungkook is more than satisfied at the results accumulated from them. He has his mate. They have a connection that can't be explained. He can't get any happier.</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>\"Your heat will hit and you will know. You're going to become this animal who only wants sex from his mate...like all the time. Shyness, inhibitions, reservedness...that's pretty much going to fly out the window. You\u2019re going to be loud, shameless, hungry, regardless of your innocence because if you don\u2019t mate, it\u2018ll turn into unbearable pain.\"</p>\n<p>It\u2019s a few days later and Jimin's eyes haven't ceased widening since Hoseok had entered his tent an hour ago. Somehow, their conversation had switched to a topic Jimin is very curious about, having never experienced any of it: heats and ruts.</p>\n<p>\"You\u2019ve been lucky, in a way. You haven\u2019t had to endure it at all because of the spell. Your hormones will emanate a certain scent that is just absolutely almost irresistible to alphas, which is why we have the cabin in the hill. For unmated omegas, it's our safehouse should the herbal suppressants not work and we have to take it on alone. Lucky for you, you have this virile, muscular chief's son who will drop everything to take good care of you so you won\u2019t experience any pain for your duration.\"</p>\n<p>Hoseok teases Jimin, enjoying the pink color flushing over the other omega's cheeks as he mutters out a weak, flustered 'stop'.</p>\n<p>\"You're going to naturally leak... a whole lot more than normal because you're going to need the lubrication for...you know...which is why I brought over some cloth strips for you to use once you figure out your cycle. Duration of heats vary per omega. They can go from a few days to a week. Jungkook will most likely not allow you to leave his cabin once you go into heat anyway so I wouldn't worry too much on that accord.\"</p>\n<p>Hoseok stops talking to take a sip of his wine.</p>\n<p>\"If you have both agreed on mating for life already, it will be during one of those heats that Jungkook will most likely mark you so the pain won't be too bad; your hormones can overcome pain, trust it.\"</p>\n<p>Jimin blinks, completely enraptured.</p>\n<p>\"Oh! And more often than not, your heat will trigger Jungkook's rut so it's just going to be good, fun times.\"</p>\n<p>\"Hoseokie, have you...experienced a heat with another?\"</p>\n<p>Jimin watches as a blush emerges on Hoseok's shocked face.</p>\n<p>\"You have! It was with Yoongi, wasn't it?!\" Jimin giggles.</p>\n<p>\"Shhh! We were out in the woods hunting...and his rut triggered my heat. Needless to say, thankfully it was a long hunting ceremony and we were lucky we didn't get caught.\"</p>\n<p>\"How come you two aren't mated?\"</p>\n<p>Hoseok sighs and picks up a slice of orange from the table. He nibbles on it for a moment before answering.</p>\n<p>\"I don't know. I really like him. But everytime I take a step forward, he takes one backwards. At this rate, we'll just dance around one another until we\u2019re dead.\"</p>\n<p>Jimin reaches out and pats his friend on the back soothingly, not sure what to say. He knows Yoongi is a good person with a huge heart. He may look all intimidating outside, but inside, he's so soft. The way he treats Jungkook is a testament to that fact.</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>Jimin's first experience with arousal comes soon...right after Hoseok leaves, to be exact.</p>\n<p>He's packed a basket of nuts and berries, a hunk of bread and some strawberry preserves he'd made, ready to go see Jungkook and bring him his lunch.</p>\n<p>When he gets to the site, one of the betas sawing at a tree stump lets him know that Jungkook is down at the clearing, ridding himself of bark and chips from having done most of the sawing that morning.</p>\n<p>Jimin thanks him and heads down to the clearing where the riverbed rests and where a lot of the crew clean up at before heading home for the day.</p>\n<p>He spots Jungkook immediately, alone by the lit fire pit, shirtless in the cold weather as he shakes out his vest and shirt.</p>\n<p>Jimin freezes where he stands, his breath taken away by the ripples of muscle and skin. He still gets rendered speechless whenever he sees Jungkook half-clothed. The scar on his chest is already beginning to fade so he no longer patches it up.</p>\n<p>He stands riveted, watching as Jungkook picks up a small, damp towel and starts wiping at his pecs and sculpted belly to get rid of the small wood debris clinging onto his skin. His trousers are tied low on his belly and Jimin's eyes trace the small, thin trail of hair under his belly button as it disappears underneath the waist band.</p>\n<p>A tingling sensation burns through his belly as he watches, his cheeks flushing at the vision on display. Try as he might to stop staring, he is unable to. His heart beats kick up and he feels his breathing come out faster, his tongue coming out to lick at his suddenly dry lips.</p>\n<p>Jungkook pushes his damp hair off his forehead and Jimin finds himself wanting to do that, fingers tingling, craving for the ability to touch Jungkook's damp, golden skin...this time, not out of medical concern.</p>\n<p>His eyes trace the muscular arms, the broad shoulders, up his thick neck, to his face...to his eyes.</p>\n<p>Jimin gasps as he sees that Jungkook is now watching him, his eyes twinkling in what can only be a teasing manner.</p>\n<p>Embarrassed at being caught so blatantly, he turns to run back into the woods.</p>\n<p>\"Jimin.\"</p>\n<p>The deep tone stops him immediately, his omega whining in response.</p>\n<p>\"Come here, Jimin.\"</p>\n<p>Jimin closes his eyes and bites his lips, his omega weakly keening and trembling in excitement at the low husky voice, knowing he is going to obey. His feet slowly carry him down to where Jungkook is, his eyes looking anywhere but.</p>\n<p>He stops right in front of his alpha, holding his basket in front him, almost like a shield, a physical barrier. For whom, he's not sure because this close, Jungkook's scent is drawing him in and Jimin finds he just wants to jump into it with his entire being.</p>\n<p>His cheeks burn hot at his thoughts, gasping as Jungkook's big hands cup his cheeks and tilt his face up. He keeps his eyes closed, still embarrassed at being caught ogling his mate as if had been some kind of delicious delicacy.</p>\n<p>\"You're so pretty.\"</p>\n<p>Jimin's eyes flutter open at Jungkook's soft murmur.</p>\n<p>\"I...I didn't mean to spy on you, Jung-\"</p>\n<p>\"I know. I let you look.\"</p>\n<p>\"You...what?\"</p>\n<p>\"Your scent was easily discernible as soon as you came on the building grounds...and while you were standing up there watching me, I smelled fresh orange blossoms...mixed with something else.\"</p>\n<p>He smiles mischievously and Jimin flushes even harder if possible. Yes, he had gotten warm watching Jungkook and he had felt his own slick, but to know that Jungkook can smell his arousal...</p>\n<p>\"Don't worry over it. I like knowing I affect you so.\"</p>\n<p>He dips his head and touches his mouth sweetly to Jimin\u2019s in another chaste kiss.</p>\n<p>Jimin moans softly, wanting more. The last few days, Jungkook had left him with innocent kisses, being a total gentleman, but Jimin knows there\u2019s more, his impatience surfacing and his curious omega side is winning, eager to learn.</p>\n<p>Deciding to make it known, Jimin drops the basket and presses himself closer to Jungkook\u2019s front, opening his mouth against Jungkook\u2019s, silently asking for what, he\u2019s not sure, but letting his alpha know he is ready for whatever that may be.</p>\n<p>He feels Jungkook smile against his lips, teasing him, before he opens his own mouth and slots it perfectly over Jimin\u2019s, his tongue snaking inside his mouth.</p>\n<p>Jimin raises on tiptoes and wraps his arms around the sturdy shoulders, learning how to really kiss, how to tangle his tongue with Jungkook\u2019s, how to tease him back by licking his lips, nipping them, how much his body likes and responds to Jungkook\u2019s caresses.</p>\n<p>And Jungkook in turn learns more of his mate as well, how much he likes his bottom lip sucked on, how sensitive his neck is, how he can\u2019t hold back his excited moans.</p>\n<p>Jungkook\u2019s sucked a small, dark spot on Jimin\u2019s shoulder before he remembers where they are and pulls back, holding Jimin tightly against him until the omega\u2019s breathing returns to a more steady pace.</p>\n<p>He can smell Jimin\u2019s slick, feel his hardness, feel his own hard-on braced against Jimin\u2019s soft stomach and he doesn\u2019t want to do anything Jimin isn\u2019t ready for yet...but boy, is it getting harder and harder.</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>Their wedding is set for two weeks into the future, in which time the priest will make his rounds back to their village.</p>\n<p>Jungkook doesn\u2019t know how he\u2019s going to last so long. It\u2019s all he thinks about, which is why he has stayed away from Jimin the last two days, only meeting him momentarily in the bustle of other villagers. His self control is shot anytime he is alone with Jimin and it takes forever for him to regain control over his alpha\u2019s antics. He watches his mate from afar though, keeping an eye on him, making sure he is ok, that he is happy.</p>\n<p>Now perched on the crisscrossed roofing poles at the work site, he sighs and stares off into the open sky before attempting to, once again, turn his focus back to work. Jungkook looks down and ties the final knot around the corner set of beams he\u2019s been working on.</p>\n<p>Yoongi has given up on talking to him, seeing as Jungkook is so distracted he\u2019d had to repeat things twice, sometimes even thrice.</p>\n<p>Namjoon comes up from the other side of the site as they take a break, sitting next to Jungkook and passing a flask of water over to Yoongi.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou are the luckiest son of a bitch ever, Jungkook.\u201d Yoongi wipes the water off his lips with the back of his hand before grinning at his friend.</p>\n<p>\u201cHow this all worked out in your favor is beyond me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Jungkook wipes sweat off his forehead with a small towel.</p>\n<p>\u201cSomehow, you knew Jimin was your mate before you even...knew? You were damn overprotective, damn possessive, damn in love before Jimin\u2019s condition was even proven false.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI gotta say, Jungkook. That\u2019s taking your wolf senses to a whole other level.\u201d Namjoon chimes in, clapping Jungkook on the back good-naturedly.</p>\n<p>\u201cMaybe you\u2019re not just an alpha. A seer, perhaps?\u201d Yoongi bowls over laughing at his own joke as Jungkook throws his sweaty towel at him.</p>\n<p>Jungkook has just accepted the flask of water from Yoongi and taken a sip when he sees Hoseok hurrying down the little slope of the hill towards them.</p>\n<p>He looks a bit panicked so they all pay extra attention until Hoseok is right in front of them.</p>\n<p>\u201cUmmm...Jungkook...I think you should go see Jimin.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jungkook is instantly alert, straightening up, concern all over his face.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, nothing serious!\u201d Hoseok says. \u201cYet.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHoseokie, you\u2019re making no sense here?\u201d Yoongi butts in, unable to take his eyes off the red-haired omega.</p>\n<p>\u201cUmmm, well...Jimin...he\u2019s started...smelling.\u201d</p>\n<p>Hoseok looks at the alphas, looking back at him blankly. It almost makes him want to stomp his foot in frustration.</p>\n<p>\u201cDammit, Jungkook, I think Jimin\u2019s heat is arriving. A lot of the alphas have been giving him odd looks when we walked through the village-\u201c</p>\n<p>Jungkook is already off and running towards Jimin\u2019s tent before Hoseok can finish his sentence.</p>\n<p>\u2014</p>\n<p>Jimin bends down to drop some herbs into his basket and groans when he feels slick moisture leak down his backside.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s been dealing with this excessive issue the last two days and he\u2019s getting quite irritated. He\u2019s been using extra padded cloths too, but they\u2019re easily soaked through.</p>\n<p>Jimin is learning to adjust to his sexual organ having a mind of its own now that his omega traits have come forth. As a healer, he isn\u2019t 100% naive to the procreation process and the natural mechanisms of said sexual organs, but now, as he is trying to work, it\u2019s becoming such a hindrance.</p>\n<p>His eyes widen as he smells the distinctly pleasurable scent of cedar and pine and another strong gush of slick escapes.</p>\n<p>Jimin whimpers softly as he leans against his table, his head full of the heady scent, making his whole body weak and achy. He\u2019s not entirely sure what\u2019s going on, but he\u2019s been so sensitive to alphas and their scents lately, not able to bear them long, if at all.</p>\n<p>Except for one. The very one he is smelling in his head, the same one that keeps him up nights.</p>\n<p>\u201cJimin?\u201d</p>\n<p>His eyes snap open as Jungkook\u2019s voice comes through and he quickly turns around to see the alpha standing inside his tent, a look of concern on his face.</p>\n<p>\u201cJungkook...hi.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jungkook smiles at him. \u201cHi.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d Jimin quickly steps forward, drawn to the alpha\u2019s essence.</p>\n<p>\u201cChecking on you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMe? Oh, I\u2019m...I\u2019m fine...great.\u201d Jimin wraps his arms around Jungkook\u2019s middle and buries his nose into the crook where his neck and shoulder meets, drawing in huge breaths, humming softly. It\u2019s like his limbs and body have their own mind, doing as they please, doing what feels good to everything else.</p>\n<p>\u201cJungkook-ah...you\u2019re smelling so...so good.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u2014</p>\n<p>Jungkook places his hands softly on Jimin\u2019s hips, allowing his omega to breathe him in as he does the same. He can smell the slick, mixed with Jimin\u2019s personal scent and it is damn intoxicating.</p>\n<p>Jimin is definitely going into heat. It was for this very reason he\u2019d been staying away, trying his best not to trigger it, but as with nature, it has its own course, its own rhyme.</p>\n<p>Already, Jimin\u2019s eyes are glossy, he\u2019s touchy and his usual inhibitive nature is disappearing behind his omega hormones.</p>\n<p>Jungkook almost smiles as he feels a warm, wet tongue flicker gently against the skin of his neck before lips join in as well.</p>\n<p>\u201cJimin, sweetheart...\u201d</p>\n<p>He can feel Jimin\u2019s omega whine as he backs off a little.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to go to my cabin, ok? It\u2019ll be much more comfortable and further away from the village.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cJungkook...I need you\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>Jungkook\u2019s alpha is positively chomping at the bit upon seeing Jimin\u2019s languid eyes and hearing his demure, submissive tone but he quickly shakes himself to grab Jimin\u2019s hand and walk them out of the tent.</p>\n<p>They\u2019ve just barely made it inside Jungkook\u2019s cabin before Jimin is in his arms, their lips locked together, hands all over one another, touching, squeezing, pulling off one another\u2019s clothes.</p>\n<p>Jungkook allows his hands to travel down the slope of Jimin\u2019s indented lower back and over the round globes of his ass, an ass Jungkook has thought about way too often.</p>\n<p>He hoists a flushing, naked Jimin into his arms, hands squeezing roughly, eliciting a high keen from Jimin, who has started breathlessly tugging on his earlobes with his teeth.</p>\n<p>They find their way into Jungkook\u2019s bedroom, onto a wooden frame and mattress made from luxurious layers of fur and pelt.</p>\n<p>Jungkook rears up on his knees, leaving Jimin laying on the furs, looking like some beautiful prince come to life with his blonde hair disheveled and fanned out, eyes shining, cheeks blushing, lips pleasure bitten.</p>\n<p>He takes a minute to admire the pale, smooth skin, velvety soft and tinged with pink, the dark hard nipples, the pretty, hard cock, curved upwards towards his belly. He has, quite simply, never seen such beauty.</p>\n<p>His gaze roves hungrily over Jimin\u2019s thick, luscious inner thighs gleaming with slick... so much slick and Jungkook is eager to taste him, taste his mate and make him his.</p>\n<p>He leans down and captures Jimin\u2019s lips in another kiss before his lips traverse a path from his long neck to his clavicles to the dark nipples where Jungkook pauses to suckle on.</p>\n<p>Jimin is moaning, thrashing underneath him, hands clutching at his shoulders, nails digging restlessly, desperate and more beautiful than any omega has a right to be. He scrapes his teeth softly against a hard bud, causing the younger to buck against him tightly, his name now a low, repetitive litany from Jimin\u2019s sinful lips.</p>\n<p>Jungkook continues on, lips brushing down the trim, flat tummy, the little belly button, the smooth expanse of skin underneath...until his chin bumps into the soft head of the omega\u2019s pink cock.</p>\n<p>Jimin is a furiously blushing, panting mess by now and Jungkook teasingly brushes his lips against the veiny, pink underside before wrapping one hand around the base of the length and opening his lips over the smooth tip.</p>\n<p>\u201cJungkook!\u201d</p>\n<p>The soft whine eggs him on and he feels Jimin\u2019s hands tighten in his scalp reflexively. With a smile, releases the hardness from his mouth, rubbing the pad of his thumb over the smooth, full testicles, enjoying the catch of breaths and gasps he gets in return.</p>\n<p>He turns his head and presses a few open mouth kisses on the thick inner thigh and slides his hands down, slipping a finger inside Jimin\u2019s gushing opening, then two and then three as Jimin squirms on the bed.</p>\n<p>Jungkook\u2019s arousal peaks at the obscene sounds coming from the back and forth insertion of his fingers and the sweet noises Jimin is making.</p>\n<p>Raising himself back up, he ensnares his omega\u2019s pretty lips with his own as he positions himself.</p>\n<p>\u201cJiminie, baby, let me know if this hurts, ok? Tell me if I need to go slower.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin\u2019s hands are dancing across his back, scratching, groping, his eyes pleading for something he doesn\u2019t even know of yet as he feverishly nods.</p>\n<p>Jungkook thrusts inside slowly, the natural slick aiding the slow, arduous process and he pushes Jimin\u2019s knees up, gauging his reaction to make sure he\u2019s not in too much pain.</p>\n<p>Jimin\u2019s eyes are squeezed tightly shut, mouth panting open, hands braced against Jungkook\u2019s thick thighs.</p>\n<p>When he\u2019s all the way in, he stills and lets the omega adjust to his girth and length before pulling back and moving gently.</p>\n<p>It is only a few moments before Jimin is moaning, urging him on faster, head thrashing on the pillows.</p>\n<p>\u201cFuck...baby,\u201d Jungkook groans, enjoying the tightness of his omega, the flushing of his neck and shoulders.</p>\n<p>He reaches down and grips Jimin\u2019s cock, rubbing a thumb over the wet slit in tandem to his thrusting and in just a few seconds, Jimin is screaming as he drenches himself in liquid heat, prompting Jungkook to follow suit.</p>\n<p>Jungkook leans down and presses his lips against Jimin\u2019s sweaty forehead, not withdrawing just yet, still hard inside him.</p>\n<p>\u201cOhhh...Alpha.\u201d</p>\n<p>He looks down at the satisfied eyes staring back at him and he smiles, elated to have pleased his mate.</p>\n<p>\u2014</p>\n<p>Jungkook wakes up on the third morning of them being cooped up together to find Jimin between his legs, busy kissing his cock.</p>\n<p>He looks down to see Jimin\u2019s plump lips swallowing as much of his length as he could, but it\u2019s not that vision that has him so hard...rather it is his mark he has put on the side of Jimin\u2019s neck last night. He\u2019d claimed his mate and it is still the most blissful moment of his life.</p>\n<p>Jimin looks up at him with lust-filled eyes and Jungkook can only reciprocate. Jimin during his heat is plain insatiable.</p>\n<p>Clearly, he\u2019s helped form a monster. A nymphomaniac monster who has learned to have no shame in bed...just the way Jungkook enjoys his pleasures.</p>\n<p>He\u2019d spent the last two days coaxing Jimin to understand that nothing they do in bed is wrong and he\u2019d caught on quick, his little omega. Jimin had gotten on top of him just a few hours ago and ridden him slowly until he\u2019d been about ready to pass out from the teasing. When begging hadn\u2019t worked, Jungkook had finally said, fuck it, grabbed Jimin by the hips and flipped him onto his back, driving into him hard, fast and rough until both had screamed out their releases.</p>\n<p>And now, the omega is back to teasing him, giving soft, chaste kisses instead of the strong, mind-numbing suctioning he wants.</p>\n<p>\u201cJimin...fuck, baby.\u201d</p>\n<p>He raises his arms behind his head and watches as Jimin continues, letting him set his own pace, trying not to die from the pleasure.</p>\n<p>Jimin peers up at him, pupils blown, cheeks flushed and Jungkook has never been so in love. This is his. They belong to one another. How did he get so lucky?</p>\n<p>With a cheeky grin, Jimin lets his cock pop out of his mouth with a loud plop! and then crawls up over Jungkook\u2019s body to kiss him softly.</p>\n<p>\u201cGood morning, baby.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jungkook almost chuckles at the bashful tone, as if he hadn\u2019t just been ravenously sucking him off a second ago.</p>\n<p>\u201cHi.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jungkook closes his eyes as Jimin sweetly lowers his head and starts licking at his own little mark he\u2019d left on the side of Jungkook\u2019s neck.</p>\n<p>Jungkook starts to wrap his arms around Jimin\u2019s waist, but he wiggles away, smiling up at him like a Cheshire Cat who's gotten her cream. He watches in fascination as Jimin turns around and crawls to the center of the mattress where he promptly dips down and rests his head on his arms, raising his bare ass in the air, waving it a little.</p>\n<p>Jungkook laughs at his playfulness, but that disappears as soon as he sees the enticing wetness leaking forth. He\u2019s instantly up and scooting forward to lick a wide stripe up the center crevice before tonguing the pinkness softly, relishing in JImin\u2019s helpless moans.</p>\n<p>\u201cLook at how gorgeous you are,\u201d he murmurs, giving a soft spank on the left cheek, smiling as Jimin trembles. He lands another one, harder, and Jimin shudders, a high keening sound escaping his lips.</p>\n<p>Rising into position, Jungkook aligns himself and enters the tightness, reveling in the sweet heat surrounding him. As Jimin pushes back, he pushes forward and they start their mating games all over again.</p>\n<p>\u2014</p>\n<p>The small wedding happens without a hitch, life becoming even more beautiful than Jimin could ever have dreamed about.</p>\n<p>Even now, three weeks after all that, he is still in awe that Jeon Jungkook is his.</p>\n<p>The alpha is sweet, bringing him flowers every evening when he comes home from working at the site.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s patient when Jimin is out late helping healer Seokjin (who has returned) deliver beta Jung Junho\u2019s twins, waiting outside the tent until he\u2019s done so he can walk Jimin home.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s attentive, making sure Jimin has everything he wants or needs before he can even ask, be it more furs, more meat, more sleep.</p>\n<p>Everything is so idyllic and perfect that there are moments where Jimin fears things may be too good to be true. Yet, Jungkook can always sense when he is having negative thoughts and would wrap his strong arms around him, nuzzling into him reassuringly, releasing his scent so that it can envelope Jimin in comfort and ease.</p>\n<p>\u2014</p>\n<p>Jimin can\u2019t help the pout that crosses his face as he reaches for Jungkook\u2019s cape strings.</p>\n<p>Jungkook coos softly at the cute face and slides a hand under the small chin to tilt his face up so that he can peck at his lips softly.</p>\n<p>\u201cBefore you know it, three days will be over and you\u2019ll be welcoming me back home.\u201d</p>\n<p>He reassures Jimin, trying not let his own emotions show. It\u2019s hard for the omega and his alpha as this is their first time separating since mating and both are overly emotional at the prospect of being far from one another.</p>\n<p>Alas, the food supply needs to be replenished and the warriors are ready to take their leave for the next three days.</p>\n<p>He watches with a tender expression on his face as Jimin finishes tying his strings and then promptly throws his thin arms around his shoulders and buries his face into the crook of his neck.</p>\n<p>Jungkook rubs his back comfortingly, stringing soft kisses from behind his ears to his cheeks.</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t wander out too far and make sure Hoseok or Sojung is always with you,\u201d he admonishes, pulling back.</p>\n<p>Jimin nods and he dives in quickly for one more kiss on the lips before departing.</p>\n<p>At the top of the little hill, he turns back one more time to catch his omega\u2019s kiss as he blows it cutely towards him.</p>\n<p>\u2014</p>\n<p>\u201cYou survived your first night without Jungkook since mating!\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin wrinkles his nose at Hoseok for bringing the topic up.</p>\n<p>It had been a horrible night for him, tossing and turning, having gotten used to Jungkook\u2019s body heat, his strong arms holding him, being welcomed and able to burrow into his mate\u2019s strong body.</p>\n<p>And he\u2019s going to have to do this again one more night. Jimin hates this. His omega whines constantly, missing the alpha\u2019s scent, presence, everything.</p>\n<p>He and Hoseok had gone out this afternoon to pick berries and now with evening approaching and a deep basketful each, they\u2019d finally decided to walk back home.</p>\n<p>As the trail neared the mouth of the village, Hoseok suddenly stops, snapping Jimin out of his daydream of Jungkook.</p>\n<p>\u201cJiminie...is that...smoke?!\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin promptly looks up and his mouth falls open.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a fire in the village.</p>\n<p>\u2014</p>\n<p>Both omegas race back into the village, where a tent is on fire, causing a heavy smoke cyclone in the air.</p>\n<p>All around them, the villagers are throwing water, sand and what little bit of ice is left on the ground at the flames.</p>\n<p>Others have formed a couple of lines from the tent to the well, passing buckets of water back and forth.</p>\n<p>The flames have jumped to the single nearest cabin and tent flanking it, sparking off more fires, albeit slower to burn.</p>\n<p>The whole roof is already engulfed in flames before Jimin\u2019s eyes catch on a scarf hanging by the front door. His insides freezing up upon recognizing that it belongs to Omega Jeon.</p>\n<p>They\u2019d passed by her earlier and she\u2019d headed into this cabin to visit her friend...who is also nowhere in sight.</p>\n<p>Jimin, without thinking, is preparing to run over when a voice stops him.</p>\n<p>\u201cJimin!\u201d</p>\n<p>He whips around fast, relief cascading over him upon espying his mate along with Yoongi and Namjoon and the others, back from their hunt early. All three hop off their horses and continue racing towards the fire in different directions to help put out the flames.</p>\n<p>\u201cJungkook! Omma! I think she could still be in there!\u201d Jimin yells out, pointing at the burning cabin as Jungkook nears him.</p>\n<p>Jungkook doesn\u2019t hesitate, but keeps running right past Jimin, pointing a finger back at him and yelling out directions for him to stay put and don\u2019t he dare get too close to the flames.</p>\n<p>Jimin watches with his heart in his throat as Jungkook stops by the well to pull a wet sheet out of a pail of water and wrap it over his shoulders before running inside the burning unit.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s just started backing up to help the others when one side of the cabin\u2019s roof completely collapses.</p>\n<p>Horrified, Jimin freezes in his spot, his omega whining relentlessly.</p>\n<p>Jungkook is in there. Still.</p>\n<p>Breathing unevenly, Jimin starts running towards the building, unable to think of anything but Jungkook in danger, needing help.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s dark inside, smoke clouding his vision, rapidly polluting his air. Jimin starts yelling Jungkook\u2019s name until he\u2019s coughing. He can barely make out anything, but his omega refuses to leave, the connection to its mate still steady and strong, meaning Jungkook is somewhere\u2026</p>\n<p>\u201cJimin! Get out!\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin turns towards the faint sound and finally spies Jungkook on the far ground. He gasps as his vision adjusts and he realizes that Jungkook is somehow trapped, one leg stuck between heavy beams fallen from the collapsed roof.</p>\n<p>\u201cJungkook!\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin rushes over as fast as he can, stepping over rubble and burning logs on the ground, making his way towards his mate.</p>\n<p>\u201cJimin, sweetheart, I need you to get out!\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin doesn\u2019t pay attention to the words, cupping Jungkook\u2019s face in his hands, relieving a little of his fear before immediately getting up and rushing over to Jungkook\u2019s legs to start pushing at the heavy beams.</p>\n<p>\u201cJimin! Jimin, please!\u201d</p>\n<p>Tears streaming down his cheeks at his own utter weakness, Jimin ignores the deep pleas from his mate and keeps pushing, pulling, tugging at the heavy wooden poles, paying no attention to the splinters, cuts and burns appearing on his hands. When he\u2019s finally out of breath and energy, he falls to his knees and crawls back towards Jungkook\u2019s pleading voice.</p>\n<p>\u201cJimin, baby, get out. Now. Please, please go.\u201d</p>\n<p>Shaking his head, Jimin wraps his arms around Jungkook\u2019s shoulders, trying not to cry out loud.</p>\n<p>\u201cSweetheart, please. Please do this for me. Don\u2019t stay here, please...please, I need you to go,\u201d Jungkook is pushing at Jimin\u2019s shoulders, trying to get him to leave, his eyes watering as well.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo...Not without you.\u201d Jimin sniffles and gets back up, determined and knowing he has to keep trying. He moves back towards the beams and throws all his weight into trying to get them to move again.</p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t see the anguish in Jungkook\u2019s eyes, the fear that Jimin may very well die with him in here.</p>\n<p>\u201cMooove!\u201d Jimin screams tearfully, pushing at the beams, sobbing loudly now, smoke inhalation be damned. He doesn\u2019t feel the injuries to his hands his shoulders, his body, his sole concern his mate.</p>\n<p>\u201cJimin...baby...I\u2019m begging you...please...please please go...\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin hears the broken tone of his mate and it almost breaks him, but he\u2019s decided he will keep trying until death takes him. He bolsters up every bit of energy he has left and heaves at the heaviest beam on the top. He gasps as, this time, it moves all the way, toppling over. In elated shock, he glances sideways at a sudden movement and realizes that there is another pair of hands braced against the beam as well, now moving down to the bottom one.</p>\n<p>\u201cJimin, move out of the way, go pull Jungkook\u2019s leg out when Yoongi and I lift this on the count of three.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin can\u2019t believe it, Namjoon and Yoongi are in here, helping. They must\u2019ve noticed that they were missing!</p>\n<p>He swipes at his tears and scrambles over to hunch over Jungkook\u2019s trapped leg, watching intently as Yoongi and Namjoon each take a hold of each end of the heavy, burning log and lift after the three count.</p>\n<p>He pulls at Jungkook\u2019s leg and gets it out just before the other two drop the heavy beam back down.</p>\n<p>Joon and Yoongi quickly hoist their shoulders under Jungkook\u2019s arms, pulling him up and heavy-lifting him out of the burning cabin, Jimin clutched under Joon\u2019s other arm.</p>\n<p>They\u2019ve just managed to clear a few feet from the building before the other side of the roof caves in, leaving a dust of smoke and debris.</p>\n<p>Their other friends rally around to help them up and move away from the disastrous area, letting them rest and catch their breaths under a few clustered trees on top of piled bedsheets and blankets.</p>\n<p>Joon and Yoongi rush off to continue assisting with putting out the last of the flames while a few of the other villagers fawn over Jimin and Jungkook,checking on their injuries.</p>\n<p>Jungkook\u2019s twisted ankle is wrapped up by an older beta as decently as possible for the time being and she admonishes him to not move anymore before moving away to assist other injured patients on the other side of the field.</p>\n<p>Jimin sniffles and sputters out another cough, taking a deep swig out of the water flask handed to him by a teenage beta assisting the aid before setting it aside and reaching out to his mate, who hasn\u2019t even spared him a glance yet.</p>\n<p>\u201cJungkook\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cJimin. What the fuck were you thinking?!\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin\u2019s hand shoots back to his chest, whimpering at the flashing anger in Jungkook\u2019s eyes and the deep growl in his voice, having never heard it before, much less be the recipient of it.</p>\n<p>Jungkook instantly regrets his outburst when he sees the tears gather in his omega\u2019s eyes.</p>\n<p>\u201cFuck.\u201d he turns his head away, grounding his ticking jaw, staring out at the open space as he reigns in his temper, an emotion stemmed more from fear than actual anger.</p>\n<p>Jimin looks down and curls into himself as he starts to scoot away from his apha, willing his tears to not shed, trying to understand Jungkook\u2019s rage.</p>\n<p>But before he can move more than an inch, Jungkook\u2019s hands are on him, pulling him over and onto his lap.</p>\n<p>He feels Jungkook\u2019s nose and lips press softly against his temple and he relaxes into the pheromones, holding on to the strong arms encasing him, closing his eyes and letting the tears fall at their will. He\u2019d almost lost his mate. He\u2019s entitled to his tears.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p>\n<p>He hears Jungkook\u2019s soothing voice again.</p>\n<p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to yell...I just...please understand that my anger is more from fear than anything else. I can\u2019t stop thinking about the fact that you were risking your life for mine, willing to die in there with me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cJungkook-ah,\u201d Jimin looks up, only to have Jungkook hush him with a firm kiss.</p>\n<p>\u201cPromise me you won\u2019t do something so foolish ever again. Promise me you\u2019ll heed my words when I know better.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI...I\u2019ll try.\u201d Jimin answers with watery eyes.</p>\n<p>If Jungkook weren\u2019t so damn scared still, he\u2019d smile at the evasive reply. He knows Jimin\u2019s not the kind to sit by and do nothing. It\u2019s one of the many qualities that he loves most about his mate. This just means he needs to keep a better watch on his omega and his impulsivity.</p>\n<p>\u201cWelcome back, alpha.\u201d</p>\n<p>He hears the small voice and Jungkook tucks Jimin\u2019s head closer to his heart, reveling in the quiet feeling of being home, being complete.</p>\n<p>\u2014</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<img src=\"https://78.media.tumblr.com/f85df196bc6d18bc1aa483825c7dbc18/tumblr_pceak3fulN1wl29h2o4_r1_400.png\" alt>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>~ A year later ~</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jimin rests up against his mate, listening to the sound of the alpha\u2019s heartbeat. Jungkook is reclining against an old oak tree, Jimin between his open legs, back against his chest as they enjoy one another\u2019s presence and watch the activities of the villagers down yonder.</p>\n<p>The skies are lit up with firecrackers, celebrating the Jeon Chief\u2019s 60th birthday and the completion of the school building.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s nearing the end of the festivities, the chief and his wife have already retired, the older villagers scattering to go home, tired from the dancing and full from the boars that were served at the feast tonight.</p>\n<p>\u201cI used to wonder if I was ever going to have a mate to hold on occasions like this.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin smiles tenderly at the words, voiced out in a quiet, husky tone. He turns his face and lands a kiss on the strong arm braced over his shoulder.</p>\n<p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t even think of a mate,\u201d he murmurs back.</p>\n<p>Jungkook plants a kiss on the crown of Jimin\u2019s head.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, now you have one to annoy you for all eternity.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin laughs loudly, reaching up to smack Jungkook\u2019s forearm.</p>\n<p>\u201cYour mom came by earlier when you were out. She dropped off more baby blankets she\u2019d knitted.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jungkook laughs, his hand moving to smooth over the small, taut roundness of Jimin\u2019s belly, where their pup is barely blooming.</p>\n<p>\u201cOmma\u2019s ecstatic but you should\u2019ve seen Appa during the council meeting yesterday. He took such pride in announcing that he is going to be a grandfather soon, it embarrassed the hell out of me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin giggles, his small hand coming to cover over Jungkook\u2019s as they continue to dally in the peaceful night air, each one wondering how to make the other happier.</p>\n<p>\u201cI love you,\u201d Jimin says softly, suddenly feeling overwhelmed by all his emotions.</p>\n<p>\u201cI love you, too.\u201d</p>\n<p>He hears Jungkook\u2019s reply and it eases him greatly. Never in a million years would Jimin ever think he would be where he is now, with who he is with, loved, thoroughly, completely.</p>\n<p>\u201cLook.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin looks up at Jungkook as he cants his head towards the left of their view. He turns his gaze curiously.</p>\n<p>Jimin gasps as he sees, in the shadows, Jung Hoseok and Min Yoongi together. Kissing.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh my god. Does this mean\u2026?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFinally. Yoongi used to joke with me that he\u2019ll mate when I do. I think it\u2019s safe for him now.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin giggles, elated that his friend is getting the happiness he\u2019s so deserving of. They can finally stop driving everyone nuts with their dancing and prancing around one another and can finally bicker and tease each other like an old, married couple in the privacy of their own home instead of out in an open field.</p>\n<p>It seems, happily ever afters were not strictly for children\u2019s fairytales only after all.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<img src=\"https://78.media.tumblr.com/d40aa8eee43d2db15d0c313cf526c1b7/tumblr_pceak3fulN1wl29h2o1_r1_400.png\" alt>\n</p>"
