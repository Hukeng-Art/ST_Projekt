  "text": "<p>Jimin doesn\u2019t remember the last time he felt this content. The blanket over him is just right, he\u2019s in bed early with his mate\u2019s arms around him and his brain\u2019s just going under, but still conscious enough to note how content he was. All is right in the world, and he\u2019s never laughing at Yoongi\u2019s intense love for blankets and naps again.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Of course, because the moment is just too perfect, the moment is interrupted with ringing from his phone.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cJust ignore it,\u201d Yoongi mutters into Jimin\u2019s neck as the omega cranes his head around to look at the caller ID. \u201cWho the fuck\u2019s calling this late?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s Tae,\u201d Jimin murmurs, wiggling out of Yoongi\u2019s arms. \u201cIt could be an emergency. Go to sleep, babe.\u201d Yoongi doesn\u2019t seem pacified from Jimin\u2019s absentminded kiss on his forehead and sits up with his mate and stays there, arms crossed and glaring. Jimin didn\u2019t stop himself from smiling at how cute he looks.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cTaetae? Is something wrong?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cJiminie\u2026\u201d Taehyung\u2019s voice is rougher, breathier than usual.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIs it your heat? It\u2019s bad?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou know I wouldn\u2019t call...if it wasn\u2019t so bad,\u201d Taehyung manages to pant. He would curse the stars and planets if he had the energy, but he\u2019s too busy focusing on distracting himself from all the feelings on his body.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDid you take suppressants? How long has it been?\u201d Jimin\u2019s already swinging his legs over the side of the bed as Yoongi groans and follows. \u201cNo, stay in bed, babe,\u201d Jimin said, covering the phone with his chest. Yoongi just glared pointedly and rummaged around for a hoodie.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI ran out,\u201d Taehyung wails. \u201cAnd I can\u2019t go out like this, Jiminie, what am I going to-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m coming, Tae. It\u2019s the same brand? I\u2019ll grab you some.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Taehyung sniffled pitifully. \u201cIce cream?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll get ice cream,\u201d Jimin says soothingly. \u201cI\u2019ll bring the alpha too.\u201d Yoongi huffs indignantly in the background.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re an angel, Jiminie,\u201d Taehyung says and the line goes dead.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThe alpha? That\u2019s all I am to you?\u201d Yoongi mutters as he stuffs his feet in some sneakers.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jimin smiles brightly. \u201cYou\u2019re my alpha.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Yoongi says, totally satisfied but still trying to look gruff.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to come, babe,\u201d Jimin adds as he put his shoes on. \u201cYou should rest. I\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2018s fine,\u201d Yoongi grumbles. \u201cI\u2019m up anyway.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou sure?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m your alpha,\u201d Yoongi says, shrugging, and Jimin beams.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The couple manages to track down a convenience store to get suppressants and ice cream; Yoongi only glares at two people for looking at Jimin before they make it to Taehyung\u2019s apartment. It\u2019s messy and chaotic as usual, except the smell of the heat makes the chaos all the more overwhelming. The scent isn\u2019t as bad for mated wolves, but Yoongi still buries his face into Jimin\u2019s neck to recalibrate.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>They\u2019re all used to this by now -- Taehyung, successful celebrity author or not, is a total child when he tries do real life; it doesn\u2019t help that Taehyung\u2019s heats are just as wonky and irregular as the omega himself.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cTaetae?\u201d Jimin calls, heading straight for the bedroom while Yoongi grabs spoons and a glass of water for the pills and ice cream.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cChimchim,\u201d Taehyung whimpers into his pillow. \u201cI sick.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI know,\u201d Jimin starts rubbing circles into Taehyung\u2019s back and the omega relaxes slightly. \u201cYou idiot, why can\u2019t you take care of yourself better?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYoongi-hyung took you away from me, the fucker,\u201d Taehyung says with a weak smile.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou brat, Taehyung, take your goddamn pill,\u201d Yoongi says, setting the medicine and water on the bedside table. Taehyung ignores it and eyes the ice cream in the alpha\u2019s hands. \u201cIce cream?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cRocky road, but you don\u2019t get any until you take the meds,\u201d Yoongi says nonchalantly. \u201cYou stink.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Taehyung scowls and pops the pill in his mouth; flopping back into bed, he pats the space next to him for Jimin. Yoongi settles himself at the foot of the bed, pulling Jimin\u2019s legs into his lap.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThanks for coming,\u201d Taehyung says eventually around a mouthful of ice cream. Jimin even knew what brand to get, and Taehyung sighs, letting the coldness soothe his overheating mouth. \u201cEven you, Yoongs hyung.\u201d The heat is still very much there, but with people around him it\u2019s bearable. Jimin\u2019s familiar scent and Yoongi\u2019s alpha scent comforted Taehyung so he didn\u2019t feel so alone and vulnerable. There is still a dull ache for sex, but that can be taken care of later.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course we\u2019ll come,\u201d Jimin draws soothing circles on Taehyung\u2019s stomach. \u201cWhat would you do without us?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDie, probably,\u201d Yoongi snorts and both omegas turned their heads to glare.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI feel bad,\u201d Taehyung whines. \u201cMy heat\u2019s been so weird lately. I think it\u2019s the deadline.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell me you haven\u2019t started,\u201d Jimin says immediately, staring sternly (Yoongi thinks it\u2019s still cute). \u201cYou told me you started.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI did! But it\u2019s kind of stressing me out,\u201d Taehyung admits.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jimin softens. \u201cI\u2019m sure it\u2019ll work out.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cStress heats,\u201d Yoongi nods. \u201cThey\u2019re a bitch. During finals one year-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNot relevant,\u201d Jimin butts in, blushing slightly.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI was a <em> fuckpiece </em>, Tae. I may as well be a dildo in Jimin\u2019s toy box, I swear-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYoongi,\u201d Jimin whines. \u201cWait, that\u2019s it!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s it, sweetheart?\u201d Yoongi says in a resigned voice. Taehyung thought he sounded like a tired mother.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cTae, you need a fuckpiece!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHuh? Like Yoongi hyung?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Jimin says excitedly. \u201cExcept Yoongi hyung\u2019s my fuckpiece.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThanks,\u201d Yoongi mutters to no one in particular.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cGet an escort or something. Sugar baby? Alpha sugar baby, if that exists.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNice, sunshine,\u201d Yoongi grins. \u201cYou have the money for this, Tae. Stop spending it on weird shit and get your heat sorted out. You can even pay him to make you take your pills.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI know right?\u201d Jimin says proudly.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Taehyung frowns. \u201cOkay, but where do I find a sugar baby? An alpha one?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019ve hired a full-time dog sitter, Taehyung, I\u2019m sure you can find an alpha sugar baby,\u201d Yoongi drawls. \u201cSunshine, can we go now? Tae\u2019s eyeing his toy box and I really don\u2019t want the visual.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jimin smirks. \u201cWe\u2019ll leave you to it, Taetae. Call me if you need me!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Taehyung pouts. \u201cYou made me think about fuckpieces, Yoongi, this is your fault!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Yoongi shrugs again, already walking out of the room. \u201cI have a client meeting tomorrow. Feel better!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jimin winks at Taehyung before following his mate. \u201cHave fun!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThanks for coming,\u201d Taehyung says again, flashing a rectangular smile. Jimin notes that it\u2019s back to its usual, all-teeth glory and smiles back.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat are bros for?\u201d</p>\n<p><br>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Taehyung spends the next few days in his apartment, going out only for necessity runs in Yoongi\u2019s jacket because an omega in this world can never be too careful. It\u2019s all very irritating; Taehyung is a spontaneous and social creature, and he can\u2019t even go out for long before he starts to feel naked and vulnerable.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Most of the symptoms settles down after a few days, only to start up again once Taehyung\u2019s started meeting friends and the like again. It sucks, Taehyung admits to himself. He\u2019s been through so much, gotten himself <em> published </em>, dammit, and he\u2019s still plagued with dumb, irregular heats like a teenager.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Taehyung is made for people, even when he wants to focus on himself and his work. He can\u2019t keep calling Jimin and Yoongi for help, but he just needs company. Alpha company, without feeling obligated or guilty. Jimin is right -- Taehyung needs a live-in, in-house alpha fuckpiece.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It\u2019s fine, this is the 21st century. If they\u2019re both consenting adults, this is no different from paying someone for washing your car or walking your dog. Right? Taehyung pays someone to walk Soonshimie sometimes, when she\u2019s visiting from Daegu and he\u2019s busy with things. There\u2019s nothing weird about this. Nope. Totally normal.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Doubting unorthodox decisions like this makes Taehyung thinks he\u2019s losing his touch as \u201cTaelien\u201d, but oh well, he\u2019s never thought he was that weird anyway. He goes ahead with a vague ad on Naver with his phone number and the alias V, and promptly forgets about the whole thing once his heat ends.</p>\n<p><br>\n</p>\n<p>Taehyung\u2019s in a hipster cafe for the afternoon when he gets the first phone call. The first thing he hears is \u201c<em> let me make you feel good, omega </em>,\u201d and he almost screeches, hanging up right away.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The second phone call comes a few days later when Taehyung\u2019s just sat down in his favourite bakery for the day. The voice sounds younger, milder than the first caller, with zero sex-crazed scary alpha vibes.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not really sure what the job is. Could you give more details?\u201d The voice is kind of musical, light and breathy and not alpha-esque at all.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cJungkook.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cCould we meet up? I\u2019m at a cafe near Seoul U.\u201d Taehyung asks. He\u2019s not creepy sounding and that\u2019s all he needs, really.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cText me the address?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay!\u201d Taehyung chirps.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He quickly texts Jimin to call the police if he doesn\u2019t hear from him in about two hours. Taehyung\u2019s going to be a <em> daddy </em>! His grandmother would be so excited.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He\u2019s just ordered another vanilla strawberry latte (it\u2019s not on the menu, but the owner loves him) when a cute, unassuming college student walks in and looks around for someone. He\u2019s an alpha, Taehyung notes, and turns his attention to his computer.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cUm, V-ssi?\u201d The kid is at his table now, peering at him nervously through round, dark eyes.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Taehyung gapes. \u201cNo way. You\u2019re like...how old are you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The alpha looks offended. \u201cI\u2019m a senior!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIn high school?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cCollege!\u201d Jungkook frowns, and Taehyung would be intimidated if he didn\u2019t look so cute.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAh, sorry, Jungkookie! Sit down. Do you want coffee?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d Jungkook says. He looks steady, not like the bad tempered alphas at the corner store, demanding cigarettes and getting into pissing contests. He still smelled like dominance, but of a quiet sort -- like the salt in salted caramel, or the coffee in a mocha, quietly making itself known. Taehyung\u2019s intrigued.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re, um, younger than I thought,\u201d Jungkook muttered.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou too,\u201d Taehyung replied brightly, closing his laptop and cradling his hands around his mug. \u201cWhat do you study?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cFine arts,\u201d Jungkook mutters, spine coiling. Must be hard, Taehyung thinks. Alphas these days seem to only be allowed to study engineering and physics and medicine. \u201cAnd if you laugh at me--\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cCalm down,\u201d Taehyung says easily. \u201cI\u2019m an author, who am I to look down on artists?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay.\u201d There is a pause, and Jungkook doesn\u2019t seem like he\u2019s about to carry the conversation. Taehyung sighs. He\u2019s not sure if this will work.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSo do you want to make small talk or should we just go for it?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jungkook raised his eyebrows. \u201cGo for\u2026?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI need someone to keep my stupid heat in check,\u201d Taehyung explains. \u201cI think they\u2019re stress induced, and my deadline\u2019s in a month. I just need it fucked out anytime it comes up. You\u2019d be free to do whatever you want in between, but you\u2019d have to come pretty fast-\u201d Taehyung breaks into giggles here, then schools his expression as Jungkook\u2019s face remains blank. \u201c-for it to work, I mean. Like, come over. Or you could live with me, that\u2019s a sugar daddy thing, right?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jungkook nods slowly. \u201cCan you afford me?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Taehyung scoffs. \u201cYou\u2019re cute, but I\u2019m cuter. I could find someone <em> easily </em>-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHow many creepy calls have you gotten?\u201d Jungkook asks. His eyes are the same as before, round and guileless, but Taehyung thinks he can catch a hint of a smirk on the alpha\u2019s lips.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cJust one. And I\u2019m richer than I look,\u201d Taehyung bites out. What\u2019s with this guy? Just because he wears comfy shirts with some personal DIY (which makes it look expensive, ok, that was the original point)--</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jungkook pulls out a pen, scribbles a number on a napkin.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s my price. For the month.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Taehyung raises his eyebrows. \u201cStudent loans?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDoes it matter?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI guess not,\u201d Taehyung says with his lips in an appraising frown. It\u2019s more than his first signing bonus, but he\u2019s had many bonuses. And cheques, and book tours.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jungkook watches as the omega\u2019s face lips stretch into a rectangular smile as the eyes morph into crescents. It makes Jungkook want to smile back.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cCall.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jungkook moves in that day, with everything he owned in a single duffel bag.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you sure you can pay me?\u201d Is the first thing Jungkook says as he takes in Taehyung\u2019s apartment, and the omega groans. So it\u2019s a little messy, but there are methods to his madness. A system. And what\u2019s the point of getting a penthouse in Gangnam when he\u2019s just going to trek it to Hongdae to write in the coffee shops? People are too stuffy anywhere else.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you want me to give you an advance payment?\u201d Taehyung asks exasperatedly.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jungkook blushed and Taehyung thinks Jungkook looks more like a puppy than an alpha. \u201cIt would be nice.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay. I\u2019ll wire you like 20,000,000 won? Is that enough?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jungkook\u2019s eyebrows shoot up. \u201cYeah,\u201d he says weakly.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jungkook doesn\u2019t relax after that. He stands around awkwardly, sometimes following Taehyung around the apartment as the older strolls around looking for extra blankets and toothbrushes. The steadiness at the coffee shop frays into fidgety hands and soft sniffles. (\u201cRhinitis,\u201d Jungkook mutters, when Taehyung asks if he\u2019s okay.)</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not in heat now, so just relax. Do some school work or something,\u201d Taehyung says unbothered by Jungkook standing awkwardly next to the fridge. \u201cI\u2019m going to do some work.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat do you do?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m a writer!\u201d Taehyung points to a book on one of his bookshelves. \u201cThat thing and that thing came out of this ass. Don\u2019t read them though, they\u2019re shit.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWow. You\u2019re published.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHow do you think I can afford an alpha to fuck me otherwise? With such a ridiculous price.\u201d Taehyung scoffs. Jungkook scratches the back of his head. \u201cI\u2019m kidding. This doesn\u2019t undermine your alpha-ness. Your student loans must be shit, though.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201c...okay.\u201d</p>\n<p><br>\n</p>\n<p>The first week is...awkward, to say the least. Jungkook lives like a ghost in Taehyung\u2019s apartment -- the only indicator that someone else is even living there is the extra blanket perpetually thrown over the sofa and the extra toothbrush in the bathroom.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It did comes at the end of the first week. It\u2019s Saturday, and Jungkook stays on the couch all morning doing something with his sketchbook while Taehyung taps away on his battered laptop at the kitchen table. It\u2019s a companionable co-existence, with the constant keyboard tapping and pages rustling.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Then Taehyung\u2019s pheromones go berserk and they both look up, staring at each other.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIs it\u2026?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d Taehyung half-snaps. \u201cGet over here.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>So Jungkook sets his textbook aside, shuffles to beside Taehyung, and sits in a chair. \u201cUh...<em> oh </em>,\u201d He says weakly as Taehyung plops himself onto Jungkook\u2019s lap.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIf you\u2019re uncomfortable with this, now\u2019s the time,\u201d Taehyung says as he stuck his nose in Jungkook\u2019s neck. Jungkook\u2019s scent is already familiar -- faintly like coffee, but with slight tints of caramel. Sometimes, after a shower or just randomly throughout the day, Taehyung can catch a whiff of peppermint.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s, uh, fine.\u201d Jungkook\u2019s not fine. His senses are racing into overdrive, processing the feel of Taehyung\u2019s limbs around him and his lips on his neck and his smell around him. Jungkook can\u2019t handle big doses of Taehyung, because he\u2019s warm and soft and sparks too many unknown feelings.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>(\u201cGood morning,\u201d Taehyung chirped one morning, and Jungkook was so overwhelmed by the rectangular smile and the brightness of everything that he just said, \u201cUm,\u201d and left the room.)</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>In heat, Taehyung is just <em> too much </em> . His scent, normally a fresh and flowery, turns somewhat heady; thicker, richer, maybe. If Taehyung smells like wildflowers and honey, in heat he is roses and blooming lilies and vanilla. Jungkook really can\u2019t. Could someone smell so...kissable? Is that possible? <em> This is what omegas are </em>, Jungkook thinks. He\u2019s really never been up close and personal with one -- everyone in his life\u2019s been harping on about respecting and cherishing omegas and Jungkook\u2019s just too awkward and terrible at social stuff so he\u2019s just stayed away. Now, pressed between Taehyung and the hard kitchen chair, Jungkook wants to wrap his arms around Taehyung just to see what it would feel like. The thought makes him blush, but Taehyung doesn\u2019t seem to notice.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jungkook has started reevaluating all his life and choices when Taehyung whimpers, moving his hips around and Jungkook\u2019s very very aware of where Taehyung\u2019s dick is in relation to his own and oh god, there it goes--</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re okay with this? I hope you don\u2019t mind if I just...help myself,\u201d Taehyung mutters as he sets his feet on the floor to lift himself up, hands working at his sweatpants.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDo what you gotta do,\u201d Jungkook manages. He sounds a little constipated but at least his dick is still working.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Taehyung flashes another goddamn grin and Jungkook tries to focus on the omega\u2019s teeth instead of those hands on his chest. \u201cRelax.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cRight,\u201d Jungkook mutters. He lifts his hips as Taehyung gets rid of his basketball shorts.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNice, dude,\u201d Taehyung whistles.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDude,\u201d Jungkook repeats weakly. Taehyung sits himself on the kitchen table and leans back to stick a finger in himself, groaning.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>When he\u2019s two fingers in, Taehyung opens one eye to see Jungkook in the same position as he left him, having an internal crisis. \u201cI really am doing all the work, huh? You okay?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Jungkook breathes.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHave you not done this before?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI have,\u201d Jungkook grits. But he may as well not have because he\u2019s never felt so out of depth with someone else.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAt least go get a condom if you\u2019re not going to help,\u201d Taehyung smirks. \u201cIn my nightstand, second drawer.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jungkook shoots up, painfully aware of how ready his dick is and awkwardly half-runs to the bedroom.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWow, you\u2019re fast,\u201d Taehyung comments when Jungkook\u2019s back, holding a condom packet in his hands and sitting back down on the chair. \u201cPut it on.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jungkook does, and Taehyung sits himself onto him without warning, letting out a sigh of relief as he does.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>(Jungkook may have let out an unattractive groan, but he doesn\u2019t want to think about it.)</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Taehyung lifts himself up a few more times and Jungkook works up the courage to kiss Taehyung\u2019s chin, then his jawline, then his neck. They\u2019re both considerably worked up when Jungkook realises that it\u2019s not <em> enough. </em> His eyes flick to look at Taehyung\u2019s face bangs moistened with beads of sweat. Taehyung sees the agitation in the crease between Jungkook\u2019s brows.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you mind if I--\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDo what you gotta do,\u201d Taehyung breathes. Jungkook nips his ear in protest and Taehyung laughs weakly, yelping as Jungkook wraps his arms around the omega and puts him on the kitchen table again.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cCan I--\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cJust give it to me,\u201d Taehyung mutters, eyes dancing. \u201cAlpha.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Something snaps, and Jungkook grips his hands on Taehyung\u2019s shoulders, arms under his back, and lets his hips go. His instincts tell him to growl, bite at Taehyung\u2019s shoulder, press Taehyung down with his own chest, so he does. He keeps his nose against Taehyung\u2019s neck, breathing him in as he pumps, faster and faster until the omega\u2019s writhing under him, calling something incoherent. Jungkook doesn\u2019t even have the mind to be awkward anymore because the only thing in his head and filling his senses is Taehyung, hot and needy and gasping under him, and Jungkook\u2019s never felt so alive.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It\u2019s a little clumsy, probably a little rough, but apparently it\u2019s enough because out of nowhere they\u2019re both coming. It\u2019s silent for a few seconds as stars burst behind their eyes and the gasps come back, chests clashing together as their lungs stretch out and collapse.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSorry,\u201d Jungkook mutters when he catches his breath. Taehyung still has his eyes closed under him, lips in a small, content smile.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t be. That was great.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah? You feeling better?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cBetter,\u201d Taehyung says, opening one eye. \u201cThanks. Or, I should thank your pheromones and whatever. You should market your services as a suppressant. 10/10 would bang again.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jungkook just splutters. He pulls out, somewhat undignified, and chucks the condom in the garbage under the sink.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cLunch?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, I can -- since you\u2019re not feeling well-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Taehyung snorts. \u201cPlease, Jungkook. I saw you eat that half raw egg the other time. I\u2019d rather not get salmonella, thanks.\u201d His cheeks are still flushed as he pulls his sweats back up and Jungkook feels somewhat pleased with himself looking at it.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Taehyung\u2019s also more talkative in heat, Jungkook learned, as he blabbered away while he puttered around in the kitchen, content to let Jungkook stew at the table, absorbing the omega\u2019s words without reply.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201c...I really don\u2019t believe in asparagus, Kookie -- I can call you Kookie, right? -- but Jiminie got too much that other day and Yoongi-hyung snuck some over because he wants to not barf, but I really don\u2019t think this stuff could taste good, so we\u2019ll just have to hack it\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Even Taehyung\u2019s voice os soothing, flowing and smoothing over Jungkook\u2019s tired brain. He understands all those wars over omegas now. The bloody bar fights. Those ridiculous TV dramas.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201c...Kookie, are you listening?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jungkook jolts. \u201cYeah.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Taehyung laughs, and Jungkook wants him to do it again and again, just for him.</p>\n<p><br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWe have a problem,\u201d Taehyung says solemnly one day. \u201cI haven\u2019t bought you <em> anything </em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou buy me ramen. And ice cream. And milk,\u201d Jungkook points out.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cBut <em> sugar daddy </em>stuff. What kind of daddy am I if I don\u2019t get you like, a sports car?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cBut you don\u2019t even have a sports car.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Taehyung blushes, and Jungkook wants to hug him. \u201cI failed my driver\u2019s. But I\u2019ll go again! Then I can buy a car.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jungkook snorts.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat, I bet you don\u2019t have yours either. Are you even legal?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, I have mine,\u201d Jungkook says breezily, getting up to look for snacks.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cKookie, let\u2019s go shopping,\u201d Taehyung half whines. Jungkook finds arms around his waist and a sharp chin on his shoulder and his wolf somewhere practically <em> preens. </em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cFor what?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Taehyung wonders the same as they buy their fifth white t-shirt. His heart seems to be going through some pain, but Jungkook\u2019s smiling (smiling!!) so widely that Taehyung just grins and scrunches the alpha\u2019s cheeks in his hands.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Taehyung has money. He\u2019s been writing non-stop for two years, he\u2019s paid off all his debts and his grandmother\u2019s living comfortably, and there really isn\u2019t anything else he wants to buy. But Jungkook just goes and spends his hard-earned money on brand name <em> white t-shirts. </em>T-shirts that sell for less than 20,000 won in Hongdae subway stations. The kid already has Timbalands, but they buy two more pairs because \u201cHyung, they\u2019re comfortable.\u201d If Yoongi scoffed at Taehyung\u2019s purchases, he should see Jungkook now.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>They just wander around after a while, taking time to be around each other without the influence of raging hormones. Taehyung makes Jungkook try on every ridiculous thing he finds, and Jungkook just follows the omega, peering at everything with his wide eyes.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bang Bang Bang comes on in a store and Taehyung gets possessed by Daesung\u2019s dance moves, pumping his chest like his life depends on it. He throws his arms up and rolls his hips around ridiculously, and it looks absurd but hot at the same time and Jungkook catches another alpha eyeing Taehyung from down the aisle. Jungkook positions himself between Taehyung and the alpha, but the guy starts walking towards them so before anyone knows it Jungkook\u2019s wrapping his arms around Taehyung\u2019s middle and walking away.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>If Taehyung is surprised, he doesn\u2019t show it and just laughs. \u201cWhat, Kookie?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYour dancing sucks,\u201d Jungkook mumbles by way of explanation. \u201cIt\u2019s embarrassing.\u201d He tries not to enjoy it too much when he lets Taehyung slide against his body to the ground.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re cute,\u201d Taehyung said, smiling indulgently, unaware of all the thirsty alphas on the street that Jungkook can\u2019t unsee. The omega grabs his hand and Jungkook resists the urge to stick his tongue out, as if to say, <em> I was here first. </em> And then he catches himself, realises how ridiculous he sounds, and loosens his grip only to put his arms around Taehyung\u2019s shoulders moments later.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Taehyung drags him into every bookstore they see to check on \u201chis babies\u201d, even though if they\u2019re in the feature shelf in one bookstore, they probably will be for all of them. Seeing them there doesn\u2019t get old, and seeing Taehyung light up like that doesn\u2019t either. After a few grocery runs and shopping trips together, Jungkook automatically walks into every bookstore he passes, dragged by Taehyung or not.</p>\n<p><br>\n</p>\n<p>Sometimes Taehyung\u2019s just cuddly during heats -- more cuddly than usual, that is. Jungkook will climb into Taehyung\u2019s bed and let Taehyung wrap himself around him. And sometimes, it takes a while for Taehyung to sleep, so he\u2019ll pester Jungkook for stories and answers to ridiculous questions, until he discovers Jungkook\u2019s singing voice. Then Taehyung drags Jungkook to his room, heat or no, and wraps his legs around him and scrolls on his phone for karaoke versions of his favourite songs, demanding, \u201cSing this, Kookie!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He plays Gallant\u2019s \u201cWeight in Gold\u201d one night and Jungkook\u2019s so flustered because he doesn\u2019t recognize the intro and it sounds American and Taehyung\u2019s looking at him with those expectant eyes.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know this?\u201d Taehyung asks, shocked, but turns it off to find a song that Jungkook does know.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Jungkook muttered. He avoids Taehyung\u2019s gaze and can only look back when he\u2019s nailed Taeyang\u2019s \u201cEyes, Nose, Lips\u201d, earning a kiss on his cheekbone.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The next day Jungkook searches up the songs that he didn\u2019t know, plays them on repeat as he works on a piece in the studio, and sings them in Taehyung\u2019s ear at night. Taehyung smiles the most indulgent, content smile that Jungkook feels like he\u2019s found a panacea.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jungkook doesn\u2019t tell Taehyung this, but soon traces of him are littered all over his sketches like the espresso spreading over an iced latte, taking over the blankness in artful spirals and gentle floating streaks. There\u2019s a shot of yellow on Jungkook\u2019s usual monochromatic works, a set of haunting eyes in his sketchbook, various candids of Taehyung in cafes, at the grocery store, sleeping in his photography portfolio.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It\u2019s intimate to the point it scares Jungkook, and he doesn\u2019t dare think about the word muse but it\u2019s exactly what Taehyung is. He doesn\u2019t seem to mind -- sometimes Taehyung will catch Jungkook staring at him, pencil and sketchbook in hand, and just smile like Jungkook\u2019s doing the work of angels. So even without Taehyung in sight, Jungkook devotes his works for him because Taehyung\u2019s the angel.</p>\n<p><br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>Taehyung comes home one day to see Jungkook on his usual spot on the couch, staring intently at his laptop.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cKookie? What are you doing?\u201d Jungkook just grunts in response. Taehyung\u2019s used to a warmer welcome by now (riddled with bright bunny smiles and random bouts of lifting Taehyung in the air). He throws his bag on the floor (and elicits no response) and stalks over to behind the couch to see what Jungkook is doing.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Coats? Kim Taehyung is ignored for <em> coats </em>?</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Taehyung half whispered into Jungkook\u2019s ear, voice low, making him yelp.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cUm, shopping,\u201d Jungkook says sheepishly.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cFor coats? What do you need a coat for? You spend all my money on white t shirts and Timbalands.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jungkook frowns. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with a liking a coat? You keep dissing my shirts-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWah, Jungkookie, you\u2019re so grown up now,\u201d Taehyung stretches his lips into a wide grin at Jungkook. He puts his arms around Jungkook\u2019s neck and lets the rest of his body drop from behind the couch, landing with a loud <em> oomph </em>on Jungkook\u2019s part.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI like that one,\u201d Taehyung says, pointing at a black wool coat. \u201cYou\u2019ll look like those cool guys in dramas.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cBut the red one,\u201d Jungkook frowns. \u201cI like red.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThen get both,\u201d Taehyung says flippantly.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jungkook blushes and it tugs at the edges of Taehyung\u2019s heart. \u201cI already spent some money today,\u201d he says sheepishly.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Taehyung scoffs. \u201cYou should see what my other author friends buy on the daily. Yoongi-hyung buys bath bombs like every week because it gets his creative juices going.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou could donate it,\u201d Jungkook mutters. \u201cInvest in something. Buy a house.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI do,\u201d Taehyung says gently, fingertips treading Jungkook\u2019s cheek. Maybe it\u2019s the faint blush or this angle, but he looks especially pretty. \u201cBut I earn money to spend it, don\u2019t I? Or else it\u2019ll rot in the bank when I die.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jungkook giggles.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHow was writing today?\u201d Jungkook asks, threading his fingers into Taehyung\u2019s hair, letting his head lean to one side so he can properly stare at the omega.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cMmm,\u201d Taehyung hums with his eyes closed. \u201cShitty.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOh?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIf you cut an earthworm in half,\u201d Taehyung says as he turns to lay on his side, nose poking at Jungkook\u2019s belly button. \u201cDo you think they\u2019d miss the other half?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI guess so? It was a part of them, right?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWould they be siblings? Clones?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019d say siblings. Like identical twins.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Taehyung nods seriously. \u201cThat makes sense.\u201d Paused, wiggled his nose into Jungkook\u2019s hip bone. \u201cWhat do you think happens if you wake up without any sense of language? Like everything\u2019s just a combination of smells and colours and you just judge everything based on how nice they feel? Like oh, that cold sweet thing feels good in your mouth.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jungkook tilts his head back, and it\u2019s silent in the living room. \u201cI don\u2019t know? Do whatever feels good? Eat the cold sweet thing?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cRight? Wouldn\u2019t anyone do that, or else what\u2019s the point? Not many people do that,\u201d Taehyung muses. \u201cIt makes them shitty characters.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou can\u2019t eat ice cream all the time, though.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy the hell not? You either eat the ice cream, or work towards the ice cream. Why do you let yourself get stuck in a low paying job you hate?\u201d Taehyung mutters somewhat mutinously. \u201cWhat are you doing if you\u2019re not looking for your ice cream?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your ice cream, then?\u201d Jungkook asks, amused.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWriting. My readers. Jiminie, my grandma, strawberries. Ice cream, mochi. You,\u201d Taehyung adds, looking up at Jungkook with that guileless smile. \u201cYou?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>There is something about Taehyung looking at him like this that makes Jungkook want to be good and strong and worthy. Taehyung peels back his layers when he looks at him, inspecting them thoughtfully, and it\u2019s completely up to him whether to put Jungkook back together or leave him in pieces. <em> You, </em> Jungkook thinks. <em> Art, and you. </em> But the thought makes him panic, so he says, \u201cCoats.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Taehyung bursts into laughter and the atmosphere lightens, but a buzz remains on Jungkook\u2019s skin and deep in his bones.</p>\n<p><br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Taehyung enjoys riling Jungkook up. Partly because it\u2019s a challenge, but mostly because it\u2019s fun. He\u2019d throw things (exercise balls, plushies, himself, etc) at the alpha, watching Jungkook startle and then glare. Taehyung would cheat in any competition they have (because it\u2019s not fair Jungkook\u2019s good at everything anyway) and watch the him sulk until Taehyung wraps his limbs around Jungkook\u2019s middle and asks for forgiveness. Provoking Jungkook jerked him out of his shell, and Taehyung could finally see what Jungkook was feeling. \u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Taehyung and Jungkook are carrying groceries back to the apartment when Taehyung suddenly shouts, \u201cLast one has to do dishes!\u201d and bolts.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jungkook half-laughs, exasperated, and follows Taehyung who is thundering up the stairs like a madman. He\u2019s on his heels, breathing down Taehyung\u2019s neck and passing him at the last flight and Taehyung\u2019s thighs are burning, but he pulls through because he\u2019s not a <em> wimp </em>and he can beat Jungkook\u2019s stupid muscles if he wanted to. But Jungkook\u2019s too fast, and so damn bouncy that he reaches the last step before Taehyung and the omega\u2019s just about to despair when the gush of wind beside him stops and somehow, incredulously, miraculously, Taehyung wins his first race against Jungkook.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d Taehyung pants, \u201cmy god! You\u2019re--\u201d Jungkook thinks he can hear a wheeze in there and wonders if he should be worried--\u201dI won! Oh my god, this can\u2019t be-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cCongrats,\u201d Jungkook smirks. He pulls out his key and lets Taehyung (who\u2019s still panting like there\u2019s no tomorrow) in. \u201cCatch your breath. No rush.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Taehyung narrows his eyes at Jungkook nonchalantly putting the groceries away, looking too damn composed for someone who\u2019s just ran up 4 flights of stairs with most of the groceries (including Taehyung\u2019s precious Milkis, and that shit\u2019s <em> heavy </em>).</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou.\u201d Taehyung stalks towards Jungkook and pushes his shoulder.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOw, Tae, what?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou let me win!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDoes it matter?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYes!\u201d Taehyung pouts. \u201cIt defeats the whole point.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jungkook has a shit eating grin and it\u2019s still kind of cute Taehyung wants to kick him. So he does.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOw! Tae!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI hate you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, you want to see me mad.\u201d Jungkook grinned wickedly. \u201cWhy else would you willingly <em> run </em>up the stairs? I carry you up half the time.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Taehyung can\u2019t help but grin back. \u201cNo, I just-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy do you want to rile me up, huh?\u201d Jungkook drops the ramen in his hands and leans towards Taehyung. \u201cIs that why you\u2019ve been such a brat lately?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>There is no heat, no hormones this time, but Taehyung\u2019s heart rate still spikes and the shift in his scent makes Jungkook\u2019s eyes flash. He wraps his arms around Jungkook\u2019s neck and stares into his eyes adoringly. \u201cMaybe I want you to pay attention to me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jungkook scoffs. \u201cI don\u2019t pay attention to you? Kim Taehyung, all I do is-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cReal attention,\u201d Taehyung whines, sucking a little at Jungkook\u2019s neck. The alpha doesn\u2019t like marks, especially where they\u2019re visible, but Taehyung just wants Jungkook to lose control. Just a little.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy are you-\u201d Jungkook pulls back to look at Taehyung, eyes glowing, finally (finally!) sounding out of breath. \u201cYou\u2019re killing me here.\u201d Jungkook\u2019s pupils flt around, glancing at Taehyung\u2019s face, his hands, looking for an indicator of where the line is because Jungkook doesn\u2019t want to cross it and ruin everything.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cPay attention to me!\u201d Taehyung says again, hands diving for Jungkook\u2019s jeans.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cTae, you\u2019re not -- are you sure you\u2019re not--\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNope,\u201d Taehyung says, gleefully sliding down Jungkook\u2019s fly, casual as if opening a box of doughnuts. \u201cDo I have to be in heat to want you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cMe?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, you, you doofus, so are you going to--\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jungkook slowly backs Taehyung against the counter and sinks to his knees. \u201cYou sure?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, I\u2019m sure, dammit--\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cTell me if you want to stop,\u201d Jungkook nosed under Taehyung\u2019s shirt, and the omega let out a triumphant moan.</p>\n<p><br>\n</p>\n<p>Taehyung finds a better strategy purely by accident.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jungkook is strong and serious and driven, but Taehyung has also seen the alpha in his Iron Man boxers burning the Sunday morning eggs and blushing whenever Taehyung tries to hug him. He\u2019s also stupidly stubborn and prideful, so much so that the eggs turn out perfect every time after that.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>So it makes sense, in hindsight. The way Jungkook walks close to Taehyung in crowded streets, not touching him but enough for Taehyung to feel the heat behind his right shoulder blade, enough for him to lean back just a little and feel the alpha there, always. The way Jungkook appraises everyone looking at Taehyung, silently and (he thinks, but Taehyung totally knows) secretly, stiffening whenever strangers get too close. The way Jungkook puts himself between Taehyung and whatever ridiculous threat, and sometimes just picks him up and walks when he thinks Taehyung isn\u2019t moving fast enough. It\u2019s a little funny, but Taehyung thinks it\u2019s sweet and he loves being carried around. It makes sense, because Jungkook takes his role seriously like he takes everything seriously in life. Taehyung has rarely left the apartment alone since Jungkook moved in.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The one day he does go to a meeting alone, Taehyung comes back with 5 different scents on his clothes and three numbers in his pocket. He greets Jungkook, who\u2019s at his usual perch on the couch, and the alpha\u2019s head snaps up.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHow was your morning, Jungkookie?\u201d Taehyung sings, putting his jacket away.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t wake me,\u201d is what Jungkook says, but his eyes stay narrowed at Taehyung.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI <em> couldn\u2019t </em> wake you. Not even the nipple trick worked.\u201d Taehyung appraises Jungkook on the couch and sits across from him on the other end. Jungkook immediately sets his laptop aside and takes Taehyung\u2019s legs into his lap. \u201cWhy are your panties in a bunch?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jungkook scrunches his nose at the expression. \u201cWho did you meet? I thought it was just Jimin hyung.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIt was,\u201d Taehyung says, baffled. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jungkook leans towards Taehyung, sniffing. \u201cI smell like 5 different alphas on you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Taehyung rolls his eyes. \u201cI was outside, Jungkook, where there happens to be people--\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDid they bother you?\u201d Jungkook noses into Taehyung\u2019s neck, where a mixture Taehyung\u2019s and Jungkook\u2019s scents combine, untainted. The petty part of Jungkook relaxes and puffs out his chest.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, Kookie,\u201d Taehyung laughed. \u201cI can take care of myself.\u201d He pulls his phone out of his pocket and the slips of paper fall out.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat are these?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, numbers.\u201d Taehyung picks them up from the ground. \u201cI\u2019m only saving this dude, though, the other ones--\u201d Taehyung looks up in alarm when he hears Jungkook practically snarl.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cKookie?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cBecause he was cute, idiot. It\u2019s what you do when someone cute gives you their number.\u201d Taehyung laughs at Jungkook\u2019s furrowed eyebrows and flicks him on the forehead. \u201cHe had a man bun. And nice arms.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI have nice arms,\u201d Jungkook scowls. \u201cAnd man buns are stupid.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Taehyung blinks, then laughs. \u201cKookie, are you jealous?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou said my arms were great yesterday,\u201d Jungkook continued, more hurt and indignant than he\u2019d probably admit. \u201cLook!\u201d Jungkook springs off the couch and launches himself into a handstand. \u201cCan your stupid man bun do this?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, Kookie, want me to call him? Your face is red, are you jealous?\u201d Taehyung said delightedly.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jungkook collapses on the carpet and stares at Taehyung from the ground.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHe said he\u2019d make me pasta, too.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHyung,\u201d Jungkook whines. Taehyung\u2019s grin grows even bigger.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI mean, I don\u2019t have to. If you give me a hug,\u201d Taehyung opens his arms and Jungkook crawls on top of Taehyung, flopping his body against the omega\u2019s and squishing his cheek into his chest. Taehyung smiles -- usually it takes convincing and a half for Jungkook to do any sort of cuddling.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThrow the number away,\u201d Jungkook mutters. \u201cI\u2019ll make you pasta. And do pushups. Man buns are stupid.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re stupid.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAt least I don\u2019t go harassing omegas on the street with a man bun.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHe was nice, Kookie!\u201d Taehyung yelps when Jungkook rams his chin against Taehyung\u2019s collarbone, glaring daggers. \u201cOkay, okay, take the number.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jungkook snatches the number from Taehyung\u2019s hands and puts it into his mouth. He\u2019s almost thrown off the couch by Taehyung\u2019s responding cackles. \u201cYou know you\u2019re the only alpha in my life, anyway. Except Yoongi hyung.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jungkook pretends not to be very pleased at those words.</p>\n<p><br>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Taehyung finishes his draft on a Thursday night, typing away as usual while Jungkook does whatever he does on the couch (Taehyung thinks there\u2019s an indent on the cushion from where Jungkook sits by now). It\u2019s rather anticlimatic at first -- Taehyung whams in his last period with a flourish, lets out a breath, and lets himself flop against the chair. Closes his eyes, almost falls asleep right there.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m done!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThis chapter?\u201d Came Jungkook\u2019s voice. \u201cSleep now?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m done done.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>There\u2019s rustling, and Jungkook\u2019s voice comes from behind Taehyung\u2019s ear. \u201cReally?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWIth a day to spare! Kookie, be proud of me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cGood job, hyung,\u201d Jungkook says dutifully and Taehyung can hear the smile in his voice. \u201cWhat now?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI send it and wait for the million editing meetings. They\u2019ll probably start next week. I\u2019ll die, Kookie. I won\u2019t see sunlight for at least a month. Feel sorry for me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, hyung.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Taehyung opens one eye to glare at the alpha standing behind him. \u201cYou sound soulless. I want a reward.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jungkook raises his eyebrows.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cCome on,\u201d Taehyung whines, reaching his hands over his head to make gimme motions at Jungkook\u2019s face.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHyung,\u201d Jungkook says suddenly, holding Taehyung\u2019s wrists to keep them still. \u201cYour heats have been better, and you\u2019re done now, so\u2026?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Taehyung groans. He\u2019s been thinking about this all week, and almost didn\u2019t finish his draft because he wanted to keep avoiding it. Preferably forever.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, you can go, I guess.\u201d Taehyung mutters. \u201cI can\u2019t make you stay.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cMake me stay?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI mean, it\u2019d be nice,\u201d Taehyung sounds a little unsure and Jungkook doesn\u2019t know how to deal with it.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019d, um, want to stay,\u201d Jungkook says carefully. \u201cI don\u2019t know how--\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah? Then stay.\u201d Taehyung brightens, tugging his hands out of Jungkook\u2019s grasp to swing around on his chair.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, why not? I\u2019d like that.\u201d Taehyung shrugs.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThen\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Jungkook looks down at Taehyung, arms braced on the back of the chair and round eyes blinking owlishly up at him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat, um.\u201d Jungkook fingers a loose thread from Taehyung\u2019s DIYed frayed shirt. \u201cWhat is our....situation?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Taehyung scrunches his nose. \u201cI don\u2019t know. Does it matter?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jungkook considered. He likes Taehyung here -- Taehyung anywhere, really -- and he\u2019ll keep on liking him in the foreseeable future. \u201cI guess not.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course not, Jungkookie.\u201d Taehyung bounds up and inserts himself into Jungkook\u2019s space, grinning the smile that Jungkook has drawn in his sketchbook about five times by now. \u201cStay with me. At least until you graduate.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0Jungkook learns of Taehyung\u2019s new novel celebration from his vibrating phone. <em>Come by XXX club friday night! Celebrating my new baby ^^, </em>read the text, and Jungkook startles from his position on the couch.</p>\n<p>\u201cHyung.\u201d Jungkook raises his voice so Taehyung could hear him at the dining table.</p>\n<p>\u201cEn,\u201d Taehyung grunts from his mind map (Jungkook had to steal a ridiculously large pieces of paper from the art department because Taehyung needed to \u201cassemble his thoughts\u201d); from Jungkook\u2019s angle it looks like Taehyung\u2019s drawing on a tablecloth with crayons and highlighters.</p>\n<p>\u201cYour baby,\u201d Jungkook says. \u201cWhy do you have to call it your baby?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt <em>is </em>my baby, Jungkookie,\u201d Taehyung says seriously without even looking up. \u201cI just spent 6 months shitting it out of my ass so it better not be actual shit because I\u2019ve gotten used to this lifestyle, Jungkook, I\u2019ve tasted five dollar lattes and I don\u2019t think I can go back--\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut,\u201d Jungkook squeaks. \u201cIt sounds weird, hyung.\u201d</p>\n<p>Taehyung shrugs. \u201cIt is what it is. Let me concentrate.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jungkook dips his head back down to stare at the white balance on a portrait of Taehyung (it\u2019s always a portrait of Taehyung these days).</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy did you have to text me? You literally just drag me out two minutes beforehand whenever you have plans.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, I just texted it to my whole contact list,\u201d Taehyung said absentmindedly. \u201cDo you think a timeline or--\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYour whole contact list? Tae, you know like half the town!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYour point?\u201d Taehyung finally lifts his head to furrow his brows at Jungkook. There\u2019s a black marker stain on his chin and a purple stain on his right cheekbone. It\u2019s distracting.</p>\n<p>\u201cUm,\u201d What was his point again? \u201cIsn\u2019t it...a lot of people? What if people change their numbers? It\u2019s a night club, Tae, not a knitting club, what if people are--\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI lost all my contacts recently,\u201d Taehyung just shrugs. \u201cIt\u2019ll be fine. I have a big bad alpha to protect me anyways.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jungkook tries not to react but his heart is doing little pirouettes in his chest cavity.</p>\n<p>\u201cYoongi hyung really knows how to fight,\u201d Taehyung continues dreamily. \u201cHe\u2019s so tiny but you get too close to Jimin and-- I\u2019m joking, I\u2019m joking!\u201d The omega laughs at Jungkook\u2019s deeply offended expression and Jungkook grumpily goes back to his editing.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Taehyung manages to invite half of Seoul and to his favourite club even with his recently destroyed contact list. The owner (a nice beta who already knows Taehyung and submitted to his charms) is delighted and gives them a pile of drink vouchers, and Yoongi, Jimin, Taehyung and Jungkook sit in a nice booth (near the dance floor, near the bar, respectable distance to the bathrooms) and chatter while Taehyung periodically stands up and greets someone warmly. Very warmly. Maybe too warmly.</p>\n<p>Jungkook finds himself having fun anyway because he\u2019s downed several shots whatever was on the table so there\u2019s a nice buzz in his head and a faint heat in his veins. He wants to go dance or stick himself against Taehyung and just giggle. Jimin is his usual self, throwing himself at Yoongi whenever someone says anything funny and getting into diss battles with Jungkook. Yoongi, as expected, sits unmoving beside Jimin, carefully dabbing his boyfriend\u2019s sweat or refilling his water every once in a while; he keeps his eyes trained on his mate, moves to follow whenever JImin gets too close to another alpha, and sometimes fixes Jungkook with an unreadable look. It makes Jungkook uneasy but Taehyung is laughing and yelling and flopping all over the place so everything but Taehyung is background.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s all a blur of drinks and dancing and friends until someone approaches their table and Taehyung all but leaps into the guy\u2019s arms. Jungkook catches a whiff of his scent through the stench of sweaty bodies and almost yanks Taehyung by the back of his shirt when he smells alpha.</p>\n<p>\u201cKookie, meet my Namjoon hyung! He\u2019s a rapper and he\u2019s had albums isn\u2019t he so <em>cool</em>?\u201d Taehyung yells happily over the music and Jungkook nods mutely. The guy <em>was </em>pretty cool; he was wearing a sort of skirt (?) and shirt contraption that hung asymmetrically off his body and would look like rags on Jungkook but somehow made looked...okay, he\u2019ll say it, tall dude with the bleached hair is really really cool. And hot.</p>\n<p>\u201cHi,\u201d Namjoon shoots a dimpled smile and Taehyung beams. \u201cHi, Yoongi hyung. Jiminie.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSup,\u201d Yoongi looked away from staring at Jungkook to direct a levelled gaze at the rapper towering over him. \u201cHow\u2019s LA treating you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMiss kimchi, man. Need rice in my body. All over my body,\u201d Namjoon says and winked at Taehyung. \u201cHow\u2019s everything here?\u201d</p>\n<p>Yoongi shrugs. \u201cHobi dropped a single.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI heard, it was fire,\u201d Namjoon says, and Jimin scooches over to let him sit but Taehyung\u2019s already pulling Namjoon to their side of the booth and more alarm bells go off in Jungkook\u2019s head.</p>\n<p>\u201cHow long are you back for?\u201d Jimin asks, playing with his little cocktail umbrella.</p>\n<p>\u201cI dunno,\u201d Namjoon admits. \u201cI\u2019m in talks with this project thing.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLook at us making it,\u201d Taehyung says happily, throwing his arms around Jungkook and Namjoon. \u201cYoongi hyung, remember when we had to live off the shitty ramen?\u201d</p>\n<p>Yoongi groans. \u201cI still barf whenever I see that brand.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHyung had a system,\u201d Namjoon muses. \u201c400ml of water, 350 if there\u2019s more than 3 packs--\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019d ration them out for everyone,\u201d Jimin adds. \u201cHyung kept all the money, too.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBecause the rest of you fuckers would just spend it on chicken if I didn\u2019t,\u201d Yoongi grumbles. They continue on talking about college days and there\u2019s a divide between them, the old college buddies, and Jungkook who\u2019s still in college and has yet to \u201cmake it\u201d. He\u2019s stuck between the wall and Taehyung so he can\u2019t just go dance and forget about it, so Jungkook\u2019s forced to see Taehyung and his friends and their lives that are so, so vastly different from his. They wouldn\u2019t even pass on the street if not for his\u2026arrangement with Taehyung.</p>\n<p>The omega\u2019s casually leaning against Namjoon, tilting <em>way </em>too close to whisper and giggle something into the alpha\u2019s ear, and Jungkook sees Taehyung in his element, relaxed and happy when all Jungkook does is sit on the couch and sometimes push Taehyung away because he just needs his space. And Namjoon just did a chin-grab thing that makes him look like a broody supermodel and Jungkook <em>can\u2019t do that</em>.</p>\n<p>So Jungkook sticks to his last resort and holds Taehyung\u2019s hand with his left, guiding him away from Namjoon slowly, and places his right hand on Taehyung\u2019s thigh. <em>I\u2019m still here</em>, he\u2019s saying. <em>Don\u2019t go. </em>Except Taehyung takes the wrong message.</p>\n<p>\u201cKookie needs space,\u201d Taehyung slurs. \u201cJoonie hyung, buy me a drink!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI think you\u2019ve had enough,\u201d Namjoon starts to say, but he\u2019s pulled away to the bar by Taehyung and Jungkook follows their movements.</p>\n<p>\u201cWorried?\u201d Jimin says with a bright smile, and Jungkook turns back to stare at him.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re a small dog,\u201d Jimin declares, slamming a small hand on the table and Jungkook kind of starts. Then the words sink in and okay, Jungkook\u2019s in a low point right now, but just because he\u2019s Taehyung\u2019s best friend--</p>\n<p>\u201cMinnie, we talked about this,\u201d Yoongi mutters in his apathetic voice, moving Jimin\u2019s drink away from him. \u201cWe\u2019re letting them work this out by themselves.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin just whines and swings his thighs onto Yoongi\u2019s lap, lips conveniently close to his mate\u2019s ear. \u201cBut Jungkook\u2019s worse than we thought!\u201d Jimin yells, and Yoongi winces.</p>\n<p>\u201cUm,\u201d Jungkook says. He might be drunk and sad but he won\u2019t allow Jimin to just walk all over him like this. He has respect for himself. Standards and principles. Self preservation.</p>\n<p>\u201cActually no. Kookie didn\u2019t even try to bark,\u201d Jimin says, looking at Jungkook with wide, pitying eyes. \u201cYou\u2019re not even a dog.\u201d</p>\n<p>Before Jungkook has time to react, Yoongi cuts in. \u201cWhat he means is,\u201d the alpha drawls, pushing Jimin\u2019s head into the crook of his shoulder to effectively shut him up, \u201cwe alphas are like dogs, right. Bite whoever the fuck threatens us.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jungkook blinks and wonders if he\u2019s seeing two Yoongis.</p>\n<p>\u201cChihuahuas are fuckin annoying, okay, because they yap the fuck out of everyone else since they\u2019re tiny. So they bark to be bigger. And the bigger ones never need to bark since everyone knows.\u201d Jimin\u2019s starting to make interesting noises against his mate\u2019s neck but Yoongi doesn\u2019t seem concerned. \u201cYou saw a big dog, okay, but you didn\u2019t even bark. So Jimin\u2019s a little stressed.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBecause I didn\u2019t bark?\u201d</p>\n<p>Jungkook rubs his temples, then the bridge of his nose. \u201cWhat do you want from me?\u201d He just wants to leave now, maybe push through the bathroom doors and hope for bare floors and florescent light and <em>silence</em> so he can think.</p>\n<p>\u201cBark!\u201d Jimin exclaims from Yoongi\u2019s shoulder and the alpha pats the top of Jimin\u2019s fluffy hair soothingly. \u201cTaetae likes you more than Joonie-hyung anyway.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019ve pined more than enough, jeesus,\u201d Yoongi adds. \u201cGood on you for respecting his boundaries and all that shit, but just go for it, man\u2014\u201c</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy,\u201d Jungkook asks eloquently, \u201cWhy are you telling me this?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBecause if you leave Tae\u2019s going to start calling at night asking for heat help,\u201d Yoongi says, exasperated. \u201cNot like that,\u201d he adds hastily looking at Jungkook\u2019s expression.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, <em>oh</em>.\u201d Yoongi rubs his face in his pale hands. \u201cI need fuckin sleep, man, help me out here.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHyung says I wear him out,\u201d Jimin giggles.</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay, Minnie, let\u2019s go home, yeah?\u201d Yoongi mutters as he somehow maneauvers Jimin and all his muscle onto his thin back and stands. \u201cTell Tae congrats for us. Good luck, Kook.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jungkook watches Yoongi piggyback a still yelling Jimin and nods a little late.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\u00a0</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Namjoon\u2019s a rapper, so it comes as no surprise when he arrives at the apartment the next day in an expensive-looking sports car Jungkook doesn\u2019t know the brand of, smiling easily like he\u2019s got the whole galaxy in his wallet. He basically has, because Taehyung\u2019s beaming at him, completely forgetting his mind map and breezing out with a \u201cSee you, Kookie!\u201d He comes back smelling like Namjoon and the city and Jungkook wants to ask if Taehyung doesn\u2019t need him anymore or if he should move out, but the thought makes Jungkook feel too pathetic to open his mouth.</p>\n<p>Living off of an omega was one thing, but Jungkook always, <em>always </em>knew when he\u2019s not needed. Right?</p>\n<p>Taehyung\u2019s worried, and scared. Jungkook had been opening up, a delightful green shoot bursting through frozen soil, and now everything has frozen to the third degree of hell again. Jungkook looks uncomfortable, more awkward than when he first moved in. Now Jungkook just sits in his corner on the couch, wearing his don\u2019t-talk-to-me expression and blasting what sounds like IU\u2019s most tear-worthy songs on repeat. Taehyung\u2019s tried everything, everything that has worked before to get Jungkook to relax and smile at him, but the furrow in the alpha\u2019s brows stay stubbornly imprinted. It\u2019s frustrating, but not as much as it just plain hurts. Taehyung knows Jungkook has hard times and feels things -- he sulks over not scoring the second highest in art evals, dammit -- so this just meant that he didn\u2019t trust Taehyung with his feelings, when Taehyung\u2019s babbled about every whim and insecurity over the weeks. There are two people in the apartment, but communication is flowing one-way and bouncing back to hit Taehyung in the face.</p>\n<p>Despite everything they still sleep in the same bed, which is what Taehyung desperately grasps onto. Jungkook had stood frozen in his pajamas after that night in the club, hesitating until Taehyung reached out and pulled the alpha towards him. Their scents mix into something magical, and it\u2019s in the cover of darkness where Jungkook\u2019s still arms do what they\u2019ve always done, warming and protecting Taehyung from the world.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jungkook doesn\u2019t come home one day, way past the end of his last class. Taehyung paces around the living room, sits on Jungkook\u2019s corner on the couch, digs out a sweater from Jungkook\u2019s stash of clothes. He wonders if he could keep it, once Jungkook finally decides to leave Taehyung for something better. He remembers them buying it that one time, in the subway near his house because Taehyung liked the colour. Jungkook was happy then, laughed even, when Taehyung jumped on his back and demanded Jungkook to wear it every day because it made him look like a chaebol.</p>\n<p>Taehyung is supposed to look through some suggested edits, but he can\u2019t focus when he keeps thinking about Jungkook leaving him alone. He sniffs Jungkook\u2019s sweater again and wonders if it\u2019s too needy if he calls. Maybe a text? Jungkook, like Yoongi values his personal space. <em>Even though Yoongi hyung makes an exception for Jimin</em>, Taehyung thinks sadly. He doesn\u2019t know if he and Jungkook are anywhere near that.</p>\n<p>Taehyung dials Jimin\u2019s number for the sake of distraction more than anything else. His best friend answers immediately.</p>\n<p>\u201cTaetae!\u201d In the background, Taehyung can hear the beep of flash and the clicks of camera shutters.</p>\n<p>\u201cSorry, are you at the studio? I can call later.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI was helping out, it got really busy. But I think we\u2019re good now. What\u2019s up?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cJust wanted to talk to my honey buns best friend,\u201d Taehyung singsongs. \u201cI\u2019m bored.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin scoffs. \u201cYou sound like you need something. Missing Jungkook?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOut,\u201d Taehyung says in what he hopes sounds like a nonchalant tone. \u201cIrrelevant.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSince when was Jeon Jungkook irrelevant?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI can be my own person, Jiminie, unlike <em>some </em>mated omegas, fraternizing with the--\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo you do miss him! Why are you calling me instead?\u201d Jimin teases. Taehyung hears the clicks going louder and wonders if Jimin\u2019s walking towards the shoot.</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to bother him,\u201d Taehyung mutters.</p>\n<p>\u201cPsh. Who do you think he is? Jeon Jungkook is lame as hell--\u201d Taehyung hears an indignant \u201cHyung!\u201d in the background and his heart leaps to his throat. \u201cHe\u2019s been checking his phone ever since he got here, the twerp -- here, Jungkook, take a breather and talk to Taehyung.\u201d</p>\n<p>Taehyung doesn\u2019t have time to tell Jimin no, abort mission, he can\u2019t talk to Jungkook like this right now because he\u2019s not <em>ready</em>, it\u2019s why he called Jimin in the first place, but there\u2019s already shuffling and static and a \u201cHyung?\u201d in Jungkook\u2019s voice, clearer this time, coming through the receiver.</p>\n<p>\u201cUm, hi.\u2019</p>\n<p>\u201cHey.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you, um,\u201d Taehyung curses. He\u2019s supposed to be the eloquent one here. \u201cComing home?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you need me to?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo! I mean, it would be nice. It\u2019s kind of, um, cold,\u201d Taehyung waffles. \u201cYou know, one less person and all.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cRight.\u201d Jungkook says. \u201cUm.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut you must be busy. I didn\u2019t know you worked at Yoongi hyung\u2019s studio?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cJimin called me today because Yoongi hyung got double booked,\u201d Jungkook explains. \u201cSo I thought I\u2019d go, since I focus partly on photography and it would be good experience.\u201d <em>And I wanted to see if you\u2019d miss me, but you didn\u2019t even text.</em> But Jungkook doesn\u2019t say that.</p>\n<p>Right, of course. So logical. Made so much sense that Taehyung wanted to scream at something.</p>\n<p>\u201cBut I can come home if you\u2019re, um, cold.\u201d Jungkook continues. \u201cWe\u2019re basically done.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah? You don\u2019t have to,\u201d Taehyung mutters. He doesn\u2019t mention that was wearing boxers and a tank top before he fished Jungkook\u2019s sweater out and put it on for the smell.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, um,\u201d As if he could stay put when Taehyung calls him like this. \u201cYeah. I\u2019ll be there soon.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jungkook steps through the door 10 minutes later and Taehyung wants to run to him but for some reason he doesn\u2019t.</p>\n<p>Taehyung doesn\u2019t wrap his octopus limbs around Jungkook when he walks through the door, and Jungkook wonders how he managed to fuck everything up.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re back?\u201d Taehyung says with a small smile.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Jungkook says, setting his camera on the dining table. \u201cHow was editing?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShit,\u201d Taehyung pouts. \u201cCouldn\u2019t concentrate.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jungkook doesn\u2019t know what to say to that. \u201cAnything I can do?\u201d</p>\n<p><em>Be here for me</em>, Taehyung thinks, but he shrugs. There\u2019s an awkward pause, and--</p>\n<p>\u201cIs that my sweater?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUm, yeah.\u201d Taehyung shifts. \u201cI, um--\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d Jungkook sounds soulless. \u201cYou bought it anyway.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2026\u201d Jungkook sits himself down next to Taehyung on the couch. \u201cI\u2019ve been thinking.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWait!\u201d Taehyung says before Jungkook could open his mouth again. \u201cMe first.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut I started first,\u201d Jungkook says, disgruntled. Taehyung laughs and all the tension is forgotten for a moment. \u201cI\u2019m the hyung.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFine.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI like you, Jungkook,\u201d Taehyung says, and Jungkook\u2019s eyeballs pop out of his eye sockets and would go bouncing on Taehyung\u2019s living room carpet if it were physically possible. \u201cI want you to be happy, and if don\u2019t want to be here, or if you\u2019re uncomfortable, I don\u2019t want to keep you.\u201d Taehyung smiled sadly and leaned back. \u201cJust something to keep in mind. What were you going to say?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUm,\u201d Jungkook says, still reeling. \u201cYou like me?\u201d</p>\n<p>Taehyung rolls his eyes. \u201cYes, twerp, I thought that part was obvious.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut...Namjoon?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNamjoon?\u201d Taehyung says incredulously. \u201cWhat about him?\u201d</p>\n<p>Jungkook looks sheepishly at his feet. \u201cHe\u2019s smart, and successful, and a good alpha, and you like him, and-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI like you, you idiot,\u201d Taehyung says, stretching his lips and scrunching his brows to show his disgruntlement. \u201cGod, you\u2019re so stupid. I regret everything.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m just...not,\u201d Jungkook waffles, \u201ceverything Namjoon is.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo? If you\u2019re going to say I deserve better I will whack-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut you do.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cJeon Jungkook. I write this kind of dialogue for a living, so if you\u2019re saying this just to let me down easy--\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo! Tae!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI know you alphas get all hot headed and panicked when an omega confesses, but I don\u2019t want to <em>mate </em>you, dammit, I just said I <em>liked </em>you--\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want to mate me? But you said-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHold up,\u201d Taehyung says, holding a hand up. Jungkook stares at the long fingers and wants to hold them in his hands. For a long time. \u201cThat\u2019s all you got from my very socially important--\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou said you liked me.\u201d Jungkook looks like a kicked puppy. \u201cI-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo you like me back?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, I-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes or no, Kookie. You like me back?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c...yes,\u201d Jungkook mumbles. Taehyung fumes this clears up <em>nothing</em>, but then his heart bursts; he throws himself onto Jungkook, knocking him over onto the cushions in the process.</p>\n<p>\u201cI need time,\u201d Jungkook continues under Taehyung, trying not to look at the mess of limbs and lips and feel the heat above him.</p>\n<p>\u201cFor what?\u201d Taehyung mumbles through the act of placing soft kisses on Jungkook\u2019s chin.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not good enough right now.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGive me time. I\u2019m graduating in a week, then I\u2019ll move out and--\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut you\u2019re good enough for me,\u201d Taehyung insists, confused. He stops rubbing his palms all over Jungkook\u2019s shoulders and both of them die inside.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u201cBut I\u2019m not,\u201d Jungkook repeats. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be able to live with myself. You deserve someone who should at least--\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re so stupid,\u201d Taehyung sits back and slaps at Jungkook\u2019s chest. It gives an unsatisfying thump and Taehyung\u2019s hand kind of hurts. \u201cOw.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jungkook sits up as if he\u2019d been on a spring the whole time, taking Taehyung\u2019s head in his hands. \u201cYou okay?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re stupid,\u201d Taehyung repeats. \u201cYour chest is stupid. Why do you have so many muscles?\u201d He pokes at Jungkook\u2019s chest accusingly.</p>\n<p>Jungkook tries not to laugh but the corners of his lips lift up.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re always good enough for me,\u201d Taehyung says, voice low and whole and rich, thundering through Jungkook\u2019s skull and reverberating in his chest. \u201cBut if you need to prove that to yourself, I -- I guess I can\u2019t stop you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jungkook sighs. \u201cI\u2019ll be back. Don\u2019t do stupid shit. And...be happy, but try not to forget me? Maybe?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAs if,\u201d Taehyung mutters. This is ridiculous. The whole thing would be a joke if he didn\u2019t see the hard glint in Jungkook\u2019s eye. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to be perfect, you know.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFor you,\u201d Jungkook says intently, \u201cI want to be.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThen you\u2019re already perfect,\u201d Taehyung whines. He knows it won\u2019t make a difference, nothing would. Yoongi always says to stay away from alphas and their fights, but Taehyung\u2019s heart hurts; Jungkook\u2019s going head to head with a perfect, unattainable version of himself. It\u2019s probably the stupidest thing he\u2019s done, including that time he attempted a backflip on hard cement.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Taehyung sighs and resigns himself to the hurt and stupidness of the whole thing before the air thickens and blood begins to boil. He\u2019s feeling too hot and too cold at the same time and there\u2019s a throbbing need for a good fuck or a bath.</p>\n<p>\u201cHyung?\u201d Jungkook says, head snapping up to see Taehyung breathing heavily across from him.</p>\n<p>\u201cFuck,\u201d Taehyung curses. Of course his heat strikes now of all times. Taehyung tries not to whimper under Jungkook\u2019s eyes on him, worried and intense.</p>\n<p>\u201cCome here, hyung,\u201d Jungkook reaches out a hand and puts it on Taehyung\u2019s shoulder and their bodies jolt.</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t touch me,\u201d Taehyung snaps. It\u2019s too scary like this, when he\u2019s still hurt and emotionally vulnerable. \u201cYou\u2019re leaving me anyway.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHyung! Let me help you,\u201d Jungkook says, taking his shaking hand away. \u201cLet me do this for you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the point? It\u2019ll make the next time harder, anyway. Since you won\u2019t be here.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jungkook hates seeing Taehyung like this, skin blotchy already and features scrunched in distress. Usually at least a hug will help soothe the omega, but now Jungkook can\u2019t even touch him.</p>\n<p>\u201cHyung,\u201d he tries again.</p>\n<p>\u201cGive me your sweater,\u201d Taehyung demands, lifting himself off the couch and tugging at Jungkook\u2019s hoodie.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNow, Jungkook.\u201d So Jungkook dazedly reaches his hands to tug at the sweater behind his neck and slides it off in one motion.</p>\n<p>\u201cGreat. Just great,\u201d Taehyung mutters almost disgustedly, looking at Jungkook\u2019s chest. \u201cI hate your tank tops, did I tell you that? And your muscles. Muscle pig.\u201d Taehyung takes the bundle, still warm from the heat of Jungkook\u2019s skin, and walks away.</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t follow me!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jungkook can still smell Taehyung\u2019s phermones over the omega\u2019s usual enticing scent, enough so that even being in the living room makes him want to tear through the walls to get to Taehyung. His limbs throb, urging him to do something, anything, so he spends the next two hours lifting various textbooks and practicing handstands. If he concentrates hard enough he thinks he can hear Taehyung whimpering and moaning in the bedroom, but that just makes everything worse so Jungkook puts his headphones in.</p>\n<p>Not even Zion T\u2019s soothing voice can calm Jungkook\u2019s erratic heart rate, so he pulls out his sketchbook. A flower, a nice landscape, some nice sketches of Taehyung\u2019s stuffed animals. But his hands seem to shake even harder, itching for some kind of release, so Jungkook sighs and turns to a fresh page and begins to sketch out Taehyung. It\u2019s the first time doing so without the real thing around for reference, but everything comes out just as detailed. Jungkook throws himself into transferring moments with Taehyung onto the pages -- not to remember, because he doesn\u2019t need the paper to remember, but just to let everything out.</p>\n<p>There are still sounds coming from the bedroom at 3am, and Jungkook\u2019s considered knocking to check on Taehyung but if the scent\u2019s this bad for him, he\u2019s worried he will set something off for Taehyung if he goes closer. Taehyung\u2019s made it pretty clear that he doesn\u2019t want to see him, but he can\u2019t seem to leave, either, not when the most important person in his life is suffering like this.</p>\n<p>5am, and Jungkook hears the door open through a pause in his music so he rips his headphones off to see Taehyung standing in the hallway, illuminated by the light from the bedroom. They stare at each other, and by then Jungkook\u2019s so sleep deprived and stressed out that he looks at Taehyung through some sort of haze, outlined by golden light against a looming shadow backdrop. His cheeks are still flushed, eyes wide, and -- oh, god \u2013 Taehyung\u2019s wearing just boxers so Jungkook golden skin, glowing from a sheen of sweat.</p>\n<p>\u201cHyung?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGet in here,\u201d Taehyung mutters and Jungkook thinks he misheard.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGet the fuck in here, did I stutter?\u201d So Jungkook throws his sketchbook aside and half-runs towards Taehyung, stopping just short of the bedroom door. The smell is stronger in here, and for a moment Jungkook could the pheromones in the air, swirling and shifting tantalizingly with the airflow of the apartment. It was too late (early?) for this, but the tiredness is slowly ebbing away from Jungkook\u2019s body, making room for adrenaline.</p>\n<p>\u201cI still hate you,\u201d Taehyung says, dragging Jungkook inside. \u201cAnd I\u2019m still mad.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p>\n<p>Taehyung narrows his eyes. \u201cSo I\u2019m only doing this because nothing else is working.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jungkook doesn\u2019t care, he\u2019s only relieved that Taehyung\u2019s letting him help ease the pain. \u201cLet me help you, hyung.\u201d</p>\n<p>Taehyung gives a small smile. \u201cThat\u2019s the idea.\u201d He puts his hands on Jungkook\u2019s shoulders and Jungkook can feel his skin burning from it. Taehyung leans in, giving Jungkook time to process that those big round eyes were getting closer and closer and his eyelids flutter shut and he\u2019s surrounded by warmth. It\u2019s gentle and caressing, and it deepens just a little more and again until it\u2019s not enough. Taehyung\u2019s warm hands travel from Jungkook\u2019s shoulders down his arms and under his tank top, fingering the waistband of Jungkook\u2019s sweats and pulling them down. Jungkook focuses on Taehyung\u2019s exposed skin, overheated and sweaty, kissing and soothing as much of it as possible with his lips and hands. Taehyung helps him step out of his sweatpants and boxers while he gets rid of Taehyung\u2019s own when they come in the way of Jungkook tracing Taehyung\u2019s happy trail with his tongue.</p>\n<p>\u201cKookie,\u201d Taehyung breathes. \u201cI\u2019ve been at this for ages, please just--\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShh,\u201d Jungkook breathes. \u201cI\u2019ll take care of you, hyung.\u201d</p>\n<p>He pushes Taehyung back gently so he\u2019s lying on the bed and mentally takes a picture because he wants this moment in his mind forever. Taehyung\u2019s body squirms, half-crazed, but his eyes are full of trust, looking steadily at Jungkook. He\u2019s probably been prepped, thoroughly and extensively, so Jungkook lifts Taehyung\u2019s knees and kisses around his rim. He\u2019s never done this before, but he just wants Taehyung to feel cherished and safe.</p>\n<p>Taehyung\u2019s already a mess after a few licks, so Jungkook slips on a condom and sticks two fingers in to make sure Taehyung won\u2019t be hurt.</p>\n<p>\u201cI told you, I\u2019ve been at this for hours,\u201d Taehyung gasps, grinning slightly. \u201cGet with the program.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jungkook smirks. \u201cImpatient?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, my alpha\u2019s just ridiculously slow.\u201d Jungkook\u2019s distracted by the twinkle in Taehyung\u2019s eyes enough to almost miss what he just said. <em>My alpha?</em></p>\n<p>\u00a0\u201cYou just finish fast,\u201d Jungkook mutters. Maybe not the best thing to say when Taehyung\u2019s already sensitive, but the omega just laughs delightedly.</p>\n<p>\u201cExcuse me? You really shouldn\u2019t be talking.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou wanna bet?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re so on,\u201d Taehyung grits out. \u201cNow put it in.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBossy,\u201d Jungkook mutters, but he enters with one swift movement and Taehyung keens, eyes fluttering shut. \u201cBabe, let me see you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Taehyung opens his eyes after a moment to see Jungkook give him a precious smile. \u201cGood.\u201d</p>\n<p>Taehyung tries to stay cool, he really does, but he\u2019s been strung out for almost five hours and he\u2019s almost kind of sore but Jungkook\u2019s finally hitting the spot he\u2019s been missing, and everything\u2019s too good and overwhelming but he can\u2019t give Jungkook the satisfaction so he clenches, hard, and watches triumphantly as Jungkook stills, brows furrowing and letting out a emphatic groan.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cCome for me,\u201d Taehyung says seductively, and it sounds ridiculous with the laughter riddled in his voice.</p>\n<p>\u201cScrew you,\u201d Jungkook mutters and snaps his hips, watching with amusement as Taehyung chokes on his laugh to groan.</p>\n<p>The pace quickens again, and Jungkook\u2019s hips are snapping, pounding Taehyung into the mattress, and Taehyung\u2019s moaning is probably waking up the neighbours and Jungkook\u2019s about to lose it. So he reaches down to get back at Taehyung but his hand is slapped away.</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t need it,\u201d the omega breathes. \u201cJust need you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jungkook\u2019s brain goes into overdrive and his body is getting harder and harder to control, moving and thrusting of its own accord.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019ll come in me, will you?\u201d Taehyung says and he has the audacity to grin wickedly right now. \u2018I want to feel it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTae,\u201d Jungkook warns, and Taehyung sees the opportunity to clench again, nails scraping skin and then some off Jungkook\u2019s back, and Jungkook tries not to, really tries, but he\u2019s been stressed and strung out all night so his body tightens and releases everything the first chance it gets and he sees white. Taehyung looks a little too triumphant so Jungkook thrusts, hard, one last time and nips at a collarbone for Taehyung to let out a startled yelp and arch his back, trembling with him.</p>\n<p>\u201cDid I win?\u201d Taehyung mutters when they both recover. He can still feel the sting of teeth on his collarbone and the space on his shoulder near his neck itches for the mating bite. The thought scares but kind of excites him, but Jungkook would just get scared if it was mentioned now.</p>\n<p>\u201cTwas a tie,\u201d Jungkook says into the space between Taehyung\u2019s pillow and neck.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, I distinctly remember you coming first,\u201d Taehyung insists, wiggling his hips as if to remind Jungkook of where his dick still is and what it had done.</p>\n<p>\u201cFine,\u201d comes Jungkook\u2019s muffled reply. \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAll your sweaters,\u201d Taehyung says dreamily. \u201cAnd maybe some sweatpants.\u201d</p>\n<p>Taehyung can feel Jungkook grin against his neck. \u201cSo you won\u2019t miss me too much?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFor protection, doofus,\u201d Taehyung snaps. \u201cIt\u2019s a scary world out there for a handsome, unmated omega such as myself. And draw me something.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019ve never drawn me anything,\u201d Taehyung whines, flailing his arms and legs around like an overgrown baby throwing a tantrum. \u201cI want one.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOf what?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t care,\u201d Taehyung says flippantly. \u201cI\u2019ll like anything you draw. Something pretty.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll draw you then,\u201d Jungkook says naturally, and Taehyung\u2019s heart does a flip. He\u2019s used to compliments but it still jolts a reaction when it comes so matter-of-factly from Jungkook.</p>\n<p>\u201cAlso--\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIsn\u2019t this a lot for just making me come first? By like, a nanosecond.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cListen to your elder,\u201d Taehyung snaps, smacking Jungkook\u2019s head.</p>\n<p>\u201cAh!\u201d Jungkook lifts his head up to glare at Taehyung.</p>\n<p>\u201cCome back to me,\u201d Taehyung says without preamble. \u201cAs soon as possible.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Jungkook says without hesitation, and for a moment Taehyung thinks it\u2019ll be okay.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">---<em>months later</em>---</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cGo home, Kook,\u201d Yoongi says.</p>\n<p>\u201cI just have to finish this and I can print it--\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe shoot was yesterday, kid. They\u2019re not expecting sample prints until next week. I haven\u2019t even looked at my pics from two days ago.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHyung,\u201d Jungkook lifts his head from the computer to look imploringly at Yoongi. \u201cI need this. You know I need this.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t have to be so hard, you know.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou keep telling me,\u201d Jungkook mutters. But he\u2019s trying to do this right, because Taehyung deserves all of him once he\u2019s successful and dependable and Jeon Jungkook never half-assed things.</p>\n<p>\u201cBecause it\u2019s true, idiot. Give yourself a break, so you don\u2019t kneel over and die before Taehyung sees you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jungkook whips his head around again in alarm. \u201cYou didn\u2019t tell him--\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course I didn\u2019t, though I had to do many many things to keep Jimin from blabbing. You so owe me,\u201d Yoongi grumbled. \u201cHow long are you going to keep doing this? It was hard enough keeping Jimin from the studio and now Taehyung needs a shoot for his book tour and you know I hate lugging lighting around.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u201cSorry, hyung.\u201d Jungkook turns back to his photos on the screen, punching his neck muscles so they\u2019ll cooperate.</p>\n<p>\u201cI know it\u2019s your fight, kid,\u201d Yoongi says gently when Jungkook doesn\u2019t offer anything else. \u201cBut just know that you don\u2019t have to torture yourself to get there. Taehyung too.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, hyung.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yoongi peers at the photo that Jungkook\u2019s editing. \u201cThis is good.\u201d It\u2019s been only three months since he took Jungkook under his wing to work at the studio, but he\u2019s progressing fast enough that Yoongi never thinks about Jungkook as some sort of charity case. \u201cAh right. Someone asked about your painting! I gave them the info and they said they\u2019ll get back to me tomorrow.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cReally, hyung?\u201d The edges of Jungkook\u2019s lips lift up, the highest they\u2019ve been all week. \u201cWhich one?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe oil. I think we can get a good price; hyung will take care of it.\u201d Jungkook smiles at that. \u201cSo go home, or I\u2019ll call Jimin to scream at you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jungkook sends the photos to the client and stands. \u201cHe said he\u2019s drinking with Tae today.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yoongi raises his eyebrows. \u201cHe did.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jungkook opens his mouth, then closes it. Then opens it again to take a breath.</p>\n<p>\u201cAsk me,\u201d Yoongi says.</p>\n<p>\u201c...How is he?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGood. He misses some alpha idiot, but he\u2019s doing well. His book might be made into a movie.\u201d Yoongi sighs sadly at the way Jungkook smiles wistfully.</p>\n<p>\u201cIs he still mad?\u201d</p>\n<p>Yoongi fixes him with a stern look. \u201cYou\u2019re being unfair. He can\u2019t know anything, but I\u2019m a double agent telling you all this shit. Go home, Jungkook.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yoongi watches as Jungkook packs up and sticks his headphones in for the commute home. He ruffles his hair watching the younger go, heart hurting for both him and Taehyung. But still, he\u2019s strangely proud of Jungkook, insisting on working on his own and proving his worth to himself. It\u2019s foolish, sure, but kind of touching, Yoongi muses.</p>\n<p>His thoughts are interrupted by his phone going off with the ringtone Jimin set for himself (Taeyang\u2019s Only Look at Me). He smiles at the display picture -- it\u2019s of Jimin sleeping a couple weeks back, face lighted by the movie they fell asleep watching, plump lips kind of squished against Yoongi\u2019s thigh, forming a little pout.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, Jiminie?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhen are you getting here?\u201d Jimin half yells. \u201cWe\u2019re all waiting for you!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cComing. I\u2019m just locking up.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Taehyung sits at the meeting, bored. He\u2019s been excited for the movie deal, but the director is getting on his nerves. He\u2019s been lucky that his editor is a beta and the few alphas he works with aren\u2019t pushy and scary -- he knows only too well how an omega can be treated in the workplace. He writes about it, dammit. But the director had a bad impression on him since the beginning, smelling too strongly of sandalwood and bergamot. Taehyung hates sandalwood.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m just saying,\u201d the director drones on, \u201cI don\u2019t understand why you have to be part of everything. Your job, with all due respect, ended with writing the book and agreeing to the deal. It\u2019s our turn now, so you really don\u2019t have to--\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI haven\u2019t signed yet,\u201d Taehyung interjects. \u201cWhich is why we\u2019re talking about this in the first place. Just because I\u2019m considering doesn\u2019t mean you have the deal -- and I want to be part of the casting and filming process.\u201d</p>\n<p>The director sighed and leaned forward, fixing Taehyung with an intense look in his eye and a slick smile on his face. \u201cTaehyung-ssi, come on. Please cooperate.\u201d</p>\n<p>The Taehyung from a year ago -- hell, the Taehyung from six months ago even -- would cower and back down in fear. He\u2019s still scared from confrontations like this, even if he\u2019d only admit it to himself deep down where no one can know. But now, during heats and vulnerable times like this, Taehyung just thinks of Jungkook\u2019s comforting arms and sits up even straighter. Because he\u2019ll be there when things get like this just like he always has. Even if it\u2019s just in Taehyung\u2019s head.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, you cooperate. If you can\u2019t, I have no problem finding another director.\u201d With that, he stands up and signals his team to leave.</p>\n<p>\u201cDamn,\u201d His intern breathes once they\u2019re outside. \u201cAre you sure this is okay? Director-nim is pretty influential and scary--\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI know!\u201d Taehyung wails, slapping a palm to his forehead. \u201cWe\u2019re done for. I\u2019m never going to see my book on the big screen.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTaehyung-ssi?\u201d Taehyung turns to look at the director who\u2019s stepped out of the meeting room after them. He still has that ridiculous smile on his face and Taehyung wants to wipe it off along with all the slick gel in his hair. \u201cI\u2019ll cooperate, if you get dinner with me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, you\u2019ll cooperate because you want to work with me.\u201d Taehyung says sternly, but unpleasant itches run up his arms. \u201cI have someone already.\u201d</p>\n<p>The director smirks. \u201cCome on, I\u2019m making all these changes for you. The least you could do--\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s away right now, but he\u2019ll be back and he\u2019s very possessive.\u201d Taehyung almost smiles as he thinks of Jungkook\u2019s poorly-concieved tactics to get alphas to go away. Taehyung\u2019s only never said anything because he loves back hugs. \u201cSend the updated contract to my team please.\u201d Taehyung makes sure to hold the alpha\u2019s gaze without blinking, then turns around and flees.</p>\n<p>Taehyung sits at home that night in Jungkook\u2019s spot (because there, he can still kind of smell him if he concentrates really hard), wearing one of Jungkook\u2019s sweatshirts, and flips through the sketchbook Jungkook left him. The corners of the pages are worn by now, curled from daily use as Taehyung flips and stares at Jungkook\u2019s drawings. Sometimes just because he misses Jungkook, sometimes, like now, to calm down. The way Jungkook captures the light caressing the things he loves -- including many sketches of Taehyung himself -- reminds Taehyung that Jungkook existed and cared for him, walking behind him on the streets and carrying him up the stairs. Smiling for him, when he wouldn\u2019t for anyone else.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell me you\u2019re nervous,\u201d Yoongi grunts, adjusting one of Jungkook\u2019s paintings on the wall. It\u2019s the third one they\u2019d hung this week -- the first painting sold to an influential client a month ago, and now everyone was popping in to get in on the \u2018rising artist in that photo studio\u2019. Jungkook still calls bullshit on Yoongi\u2019s silver tongue, but he\u2019s thankful. \u201cIs this straight?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes. No.\u201d Jungkook squinted. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCalm down, Kook,\u201d Yoongi snorted. \"You're seeing Tae again. What's wrong?\"\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"Um.\" Jungkook mutters, staring intently at his own painting on the wall. It was done a while ago when he was yearning for Taehyung with everything he's got; he'd had to consciously think about staying in his apartment and not stomping down Taehyung's door. He hasn't allowed himself to think about such things since then -- just found the nearest sketchbook to take his mind off of Taehyung's smell and the feel of biting his collarbone when he really just wanted to sink his teeth on his shoulder. So his scent will be with him all the time, so he won't be so\u00a0<em>worried</em>.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"Talk,\" Yoongi grunts. He's crossing his arms and rolling his eyes and he\u00a0looks like the icon of\u00a0<em>done with it.</em></p>\n<p>\"How did you ask...Jimin-hyung to, um, mate?\" Jungkook forces the words out and wants to run away but he also really needs to hear the answer.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"Oh, thank god,\" Yoongi snorts. \"Just ask him. He's been waiting for it since forever.\"\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"But what if...isn't it too soon?\"\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"He waited for you for months, Kook-ah. What else do you need? I might have to kick you out if you're going to be an idiot.\"</p>\n<p>But Jungkook still feels terrible, for making Taehyung wait, for not being good enough. But Jungkook supposes that he'll just have to...try. Since living without Taehyung would probably be worse.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou need me, hyung,\u201d Jungkook says cheekily. \u201cWho will handle all your clients when you\u2019re off doing god knows what with Jimin-hyung?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI gave you some of my precious clients and this is how you repay me?\u201d Yoongi growls. \u201cCome here, I need to--\u201d</p>\n<p>Jungkook dances away, cackling. \u201cEy, hyung, don\u2019t be so--\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cJungkook?\u201d</p>\n<p>Taehyung stands in the doorway of Yoongi\u2019s studio, staring at the boy he\u2019s half in love with (okay, completely in love with) laughing with Yoongi-hyung.</p>\n<p>\u201cTaehyung-hyung!\u201d Jungkook smiles sheepishly. \u201cHi.\u201d</p>\n<p>Taehyung squints at Jungkook in his striped t-shirt and Timbalands. Then he stalks towards him, brandishing a preliminary script.</p>\n<p>\u201cHow -- could -- you --\u201d he grits out, whacking at Jungkook\u2019s raised forearms, \u201cleave -- you were here the whole time?!\u201d Taehyung turns his crazed gaze to Jimin, who raises his arms up in a surrender position.</p>\n<p>\u201cHave fun,\u201d Yoongi said soullessly, and leads Jimin out.</p>\n<p>\u201cSorry Tae!\u201d Jimin squeaks, and the door shuts.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m so mad at you.\u201d Taehyung says as he tries not to hug Jungkook to death. Actually, that sounds like a good idea. Because he wants Jungkook <em>dead</em>.</p>\n<p>\u201cAfter six months?\u201d Jungkook asks, and has the audacity to smile. Since when did he smile so easily? Jungkook slowly takes a few steps towards Taehyung and wraps his arms around him slowly, giving the omega time to push him away. He doesn\u2019t.</p>\n<p>Taehyung wasn\u2019t going to give in so easily when he saw Jungkook again (he\u2019d planned his speech in the shower) but one whiff of Jungkook\u2019s scent and Taehyung almost swoons. So he lets Jungkook envelop him and sticks his nose in the alpha\u2019s neck, lets his body calm. He feels safe for the first time in six months.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Jungkook mutters. \u201cWas it hard?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Taehyung says, crying quietly into Jungkook\u2019s shirt. \u201cHave you been well?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWorking like crazy,\u201d Jungkook laughs. \u201cSo I could see you again and not feel ashamed.\u201d</p>\n<p>Still stupid, Taehyung thinks. \u201cWere you here the whole time?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah. Yoongi hyung gave me a job here, and I sell some paintings too.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo I wasn\u2019t hallucinating when I smelled you on Yoongi hyung and Jiminie?\u201d Taehyung breaks away and slaps at Jungkook\u2019s chest again. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t anyone tell me? Why are you still a muscle pig?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m weak,\u201d Jungkook says guilelessly. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have let you go if I saw you again.\u201d</p>\n<p>Taehyung\u2019s knees soften to jello. \u201cAnd now?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll be here, always. For as long as you\u2019ll have me.\u201d</p>\n<p>It sounds deceptively simple, so Taehyung looks into Jungkook\u2019s eyes one last time to see that it really is him and leans in for a kiss. Their scents mix together in a matter of seconds and (surprise) hands start flying everywhere, looking for skin.</p>\n<p>\u201cTae? Now? Really?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShut up,\u201d Taehyung mutters. \u201cCome home with me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jungkook raises his eyebrows. He looks sexy like this, more confident and sure in his skin. \u201cFor old times\u2019 sake?\u201d</p>\n<p>Taehyung laughs. \u201cMate me this time. Don\u2019t chicken out,\u201d he pushes his tattered sweater to reveal a slight scar on his collarbone. Jungkook blushes when he realizes it\u2019s his sweater, and the events that were behind the tiny scar there. He\u2019d wondered if Taehyung noticed the bite and how close it was to The Bite<em>.</em></p>\n<p>\u201cThere you are,\u201d Taehyung smiled, wrapping his arms around Jungkook\u2019s neck. \u201cThere\u2019s my little blushing Kookie.\u201d He jumps and wraps his legs around Jungkook without warning, but Jungkook just gives a grunt and catches him.</p>\n<p>\u201cWalk!\u201d Taehyung giggles, so Jungkook takes them both out the studio.</p>\n<p>\u201cDid you only miss me for carrying you around?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd the heat relief,\u201d Taehyung teases, nipping at Jungkook\u2019s neck. \u201cMy dildos don\u2019t work nearly as well.\u201d Jungkook\u2019s scent is strong and rich compared to the old sweaters that Taehyung has been living off of. Taehyung\u2019s legs clench a little tighter around Jungkook\u2019s waist.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cCome pick me up from the office tomorrow,\u201d Taehyung says later that night, playing with Jungkook\u2019s hands as they catch their breaths.</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m going to show you off to the director so he won\u2019t bother me anymore,\u201d Taehyung sighs happily.</p>\n<p>Jungkook tightens his grip on Taehyung\u2019s hand. \u201cHe\u2019s bothering you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, since I\u2019m unmarked and smelling like little old me--\u201d Jungkook growls again and flips on top of Taehyung. \u201cSince someone\u2019s stupid and <em>still won\u2019t mate me</em>--\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou know why,\u201d Jungkook protests, but he\u2019s breathing rather aggressively against Taehyung\u2019s open mouth. Something twitches against his stomach and he wonders how they could be up for round two already. \u201cWhat if you regret it?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI won\u2019t. I love you,\u201d Taehyung says simply. Jungkook reels -- he wonders if his parents had given love to him this easily, before he went to art school and basically never returned their calls. Now, Jungkook thinks about showing up at his old house with pictures of his sold paintings and exhibits and \u2013 say what, exactly, he hasn\u2019t figured out. Prove to them that he did it after all? Say sorry, for being so stubborn? Bring them money? He\u2019s been alone for so long that Jungkook doesn\u2019t remember how to be close to people.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou look like you\u2019ve never heard someone say that before,\u201d Taehyung teases, stroking at the little baby fat left on Jungkook\u2019s cheeks. \u201cKookie? Are you crying?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo.\u201d Jungkook feels like the awkward and bumbling kid who\u2019d actually start crying if someone asked if he was. Taehyung\u2019s always been good at bringing emotions out in Jungkook. Maybe he\u2019s been doing it \u2013 including all those ridiculous things to piss Jungkook off \u2013 so the alpha could love him and be loved.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou are!\u201d Taehyung looks delighted to see the wet pooling around Jungkook\u2019s eyes and he flips them over so he can stare down at them. \u201cMy big baby--\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHyung!\u201d The urge to cry and hug Taehyung into eternity ebbs away as Jungkook glares at Taehyung\u2019s shit eating grin. \u201cYou\u2019re not helping.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jungkook looks like he\u2019s stewing on some long elaborate speech about responsibilities and love and whatever the fuck else, but Taehyung\u2019s never been a patient person and he\u2019s waited long enough.</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you love me, Kookie?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUm,\u201d Jungkook rubs his nose against Taehyung\u2019s neck for confidence. \u201cYes?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t sound so sure,\u201d Taehyung scoffs. He looks away for a second, wondering if it\u2019s okay to be kind of disappointed. Jungkook notices.</p>\n<p>\u201cHyung! I love you.\u201d Taehyung looks down to see a bright smile starting to unfurl on Jungkook\u2019s face and the giddiness is infectious.</p>\n<p>\u201cGood.\u201d Taehyung sits back and presses his hands on Jungkook\u2019s chest, drawing circles with his hot palms. He lifts his hips and leans forward, steadying himself on Jungkook\u2019s firm muscles.</p>\n<p>\u201cGood.\u201d Jungkook adjusts himself so he\u2019s positioned at the right angle against Taehyung\u2019s entrance, mind almost going mad from the heat and urgency starting all over again.</p>\n<p>\u201cFine.\u201d Taehyung hums happily as he sinks himself onto Jungkook, rolling his head around and grinning lazily.</p>\n<p>\u201cFine,\u201d Jungkook grits, and forces himself to stay still as Taehyung moves. He puts his hands on Taehyung\u2019s hips and they squeeze when Taehyung lets out a particularly loud groan. Jungkook doesn\u2019t know what Taehyung\u2019s playing now but whatever it is, he\u2019s going to <em>win</em>.</p>\n<p>\u201cAh, Kookie,\u201d Taehyung gasps as he sinks down slowly again. \u201cYou\u2019re the best.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jungkook tries not to lose it (and the control over his ego) but his hips are starting to move and twitch without his permission.</p>\n<p>\u201cAh -- Tae--\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI want you, Kookie,\u201d Taehyung says, leaning forward so his chest is flush with Jungkook\u2019s. Those brown eyes pin him down again and Jungkook can barely think, but his hips are bucking and snapping up, punctuating Taehyung\u2019s breathing with little gasps. \u201cDon\u2019t you think I\u2019ve waited enough?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m here,\u201d Jungkook manages to say.</p>\n<p>\u201cProve it,\u201d Taehyung gasps, voice low and husky and a little croaked. Taehyung rests his elbows against Jungkook\u2019s shoulders and bares his neck, offering bare, tanned skin.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s panic at the back of Jungkook\u2019s mind, freaking out at what his body is doing but Taehyung\u2019s already flipped under him again with a growl and Jungkook\u2019s licking at the skin at the omega\u2019s neck, inhaling the smells of Taehyung and pheromones and sweat.</p>\n<p>\u201cLook at me, Tae.\u201d Taehyung turns his head to look at Jungkook, eyes piercing as ever.</p>\n<p>\u201cTell me you\u2019re sure.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI need this, Jungkook please just do it--\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTell me,\u201d Jungkook implores.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sure, Jungkook. Mate me.\u201d</p>\n<p>So Jungkook does.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Taehyung wakes up with his heart bursting. There\u2019s a cheesy, rectangular grin on his face even when he pecks at Jungkook\u2019s still sleeping face and\u00a0heads\u00a0for a shower; it only widens when he feels arms around him as he\u2019s making breakfast.</p>\n<p>Being with Jungkook has always been comfortable, but there\u2019s a solidness and sureness to being mated, where all he wants in life is to be near Jungkook.</p>\n<p>Jungkook looks a little bewildered, and he won\u2019t stop touching Taehyung at all times. He leaves his hand on Taehyung\u2019s as they eat, and slots their sides together as they brush teeth, and jams his chin into Taehyung\u2019s shoulder to look at what his mate is doing. Taehyung\u2019s buzzing happily from all the places Jungkook absentmindedly touches.</p>\n<p>Taehyung shows up to his meeting proudly sporting the scent of a newly mated wolf and Jungkook at his heels, glaring at all the alphas and betas for good measure. He stands with his chin on Taehyung\u2019s shoulder and arms around his waist as they wait in line for drinks at the caf\u00e9, and doesn\u2019t leave until he properly scents his mate in front of everyone, including the hotshot alpha director.</p>\n<p>Yoongi finds Jungkook at his appointment reeking of Taehyung and tells him to put on cologne because it\u2019s gross (even though Jungkook thinks it\u2019s unfair when he\u2019s started to associate Yoongi and Jimin\u2019s scents as one identity) but he pats Jungkook\u2019s head in silent, stoic approval.</p>\n<p>Jimin visits the studio that day and whiffs at Jungkook\u2019s arm suspiciously (\u201cWhat the hell, hyung?\u201d) before starting to squeal something about how this was all his idea.</p>\n<p>When Jungkook\u2019s lease ends, he moves back into Taehyung\u2019s apartment and reclaims that spot on the sofa as his editing seat. Taehyung still sits there sometimes in Jungkook\u2019s sweater and flips through the sketchbook whenever his mate\u2019s out late for a shoot.</p>"
