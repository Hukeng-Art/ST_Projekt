  "text": "<p>Beside his bedroom window, Tim takes a moment to double check he\u2019s got everything with him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>His phone is safely nested within the inside pocket of his jacket where it can\u2019t fall out, and his camera is stuffed inside its case, a grounding weight against his chest where it rests underneath his zipped up jacket. When he snakes a hand into his left jeans pocket, his keys jingle quietly when he skims them with his fingers. On his right thigh, he can feel the outline of the granola bars in his other pocket, a late night snack in case he gets hungry.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The moon is full in the sky, and Tim slides the window open with a grin, breathing deeply and relishing in the wind that tousles his hair and the hint of freedom in the air. The branch beneath his feet creak worryingly, but he\u2019s done this enough times to know it\u2019ll hold steady as he makes his way down the tree. As soon as he touches the ground, he pulls his hood up and starts making his way to the nearest bus station with only the light from the full moon and his memory to guide his footsteps.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It\u2019s a beautiful night for birdwatching.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The new Robin fires his grapple at a close by building and Tim holds his breath, finger trembling on the shutter button. He scoots closer to the edge of the building\u2019s roof, leaning as far as he dares, and watches as the boy tugs twice to make sure his hook is caught on its target before he jumps off his roof. Tim locks his eyes onto him, waiting just until\u2014</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em> Click. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The picture is perfect. Mid-flip, Robin\u2019s bright yellow cape catches the light of the full moon as he flies through the air, the very image of freedom. Tim smiles down at it and takes a moment to feel pride in his progress. Gone are the days of blurry action shots and too dark photos.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tim Drake, everyone. Professional photographer.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Ahead of him, Robin is already making his way to the next rooftop, and if he squints and tilts his head just so, Tim can see the outline of a shadowed figure waiting for him. Tim gasps silently and raises his camera immediately, but it\u2019s no use. Even with his talent, Batman is <em> Batman </em>. There\u2019s a reason there are so few photos of him. If he doesn\u2019t want to get caught, he won\u2019t, plain and simple.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><em> If I want a chance of getting a picture of him </em> , Tim thinks as he stashes his camera back into its case and darts over to the fire escape, practically sliding down the handles, <em> I\u2019m gonna need to get closer. </em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Honestly, though, Tim wouldn\u2019t say no to more pictures of the new Robin. He\u2019d appeared only two weeks ago, and seemed to be doing an impressive job of living up to his predecessor\u2019s reputation. Better, even.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Yes, the new Robin was more inclined to let his fists do the talking, but it was clear that he was more than just a typical fighter. He was a protector and it showed, in the way he offered to walk the working ladies home, in the way he took count of all the street kids in the area and made it impossible for someone to make one quietly disappear. With the new Robin came a Batman more willing to patrol within Crime Alley, taking the time to actually traverse the area instead of what used to be the occasional dash through.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tim missed Dick. Seeing another boy in the costume made Tim ache for his hero like a phantom limb.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>But he didn\u2019t think it\u2019d be so bad, getting used to this new Robin.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tim stumbles after jumping from the last rung and onto solid ground, but quickly regains his footing. He\u2019s got to move fast if he wants any chance of catching up to Batman and Robin while they get the luxury of grappling hooks.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>And into the heart of Gotham Tim plunges.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Run. Stick to the shadows. Turn right at Ivy Meadow Lane. Keep close to the buildings. Avoid the drunk, stumbling man sinking with a voice that ice skates on his bones. Turn left at Doris Avenue to make up for avoiding him. Acknowledge the sound of a car engine cutting through the air. Ignore it. Keep running. Jump over a cat at the last second. Thank every deity you know you won\u2019t be getting on Catwoman\u2019s bad side tonight.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tim slows to a jog as he approaches the alleyway he\u2019s fairly certain will give him a better view of the Dynamic Duo With the full moon behind him hopefully casting a strong enough glow onto everything below (Tim is crossing his fingers <em> and </em>his toes), there\u2019s a chance he\u2019ll be finally able to catch the elusive Batman on camera.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tim turns right and immediately yelps, stumbling backwards and throwing up a hand against the brilliant glare that seems determined to drill right into his brain. The light seeps into everything, everywhere, all-encompassing even as Tim tries to squeeze his eyes against it, to shake out the rumble of thunder that floods his ears. Why would anything need to be that brig\u2014</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDid you kill him? Is he dead?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cRo\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, my god. You killed a toddler. Oh, my <em> god </em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s not dead,\u201d a deep voice says quickly. \u201cHe\u2019s just\u2026unconscious.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201c<em> How is that any better? </em>\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tim breathes slowly. There\u2019s gravel digging into his back and two voices by his side, both being entirely too loud for Tim\u2019s spinning head. His left ankle is a dull throbbing pain that grows as his brain starts to come into focus.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cInjuries?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t change the subject!\u201d There\u2019s a large, pregnant silence before the second voice, younger, caught between boy and man, sighs shakily and reports, \u201cMinor bruises, some cuts on his knees and a small bump at the back of his head. I don\u2019t think there are any broken bones, but I don\u2019t like the look of his ankle, B. I could've sworn I heard a loud crack, even through the window.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>An acknowledging grunt is the only response. Faintly, Tim feels big hands ghost over his ribs, occasionally applying pressure before moving onto the back of his head.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cShouldn\u2019t we be taking him to Leslie?\u201d Why are we still here?\u201d The younger voice demands, squeezing Tim\u2019s hand where he\u2019s surprised to realize it\u2019s being cradled between two others.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201c...I don\u2019t want to rule out a spinal injury,\u201d the deeper voice reluctantly says, and Tim hears a sharp inhale.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou think\u2014?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNo.\u201d The answer comes immediately. \u201cBut just in case. I\u2019d rather be cautious and wrong than reckless and cause more harm. We already have enough to apologize for.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201c<em> We? </em> \u201d The younger voice demands indignantly. \u201cMy feet don\u2019t even reach the pedals. There is no <em> we </em>in this situation.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2026We\u2019ll discuss the logistics later.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>A big hand pats gently against Tim\u2019s cheek as the younger voice makes a noise of deep offense that goes unacknowledged. \u201cChum? Time to wake up now, please. Come on\u2014there you go.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tim groans and fights to keep his eyes open, squinting against his blurry vision. A dark shape hovers above him, nothing discernible except for the stark white lenses where his eyes should be. In the corner of his eye, he can see a brighter and smaller blurred smear.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tim\u2019s breath catches in his throat. Holy shit. <em> Holy shit.\u00a0 </em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t try to get up just yet,\u201d fucking <em> Batman </em> says as Tim\u2019s vision slowly comes into focus, moving his hand from Tim\u2019s cheek to rest it firmly against his chest. \u201cCan you tell me where there\u2019s any pain?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cUm,\u201d Tim croaks out, mercilessly strangling the high pitched screech that threatens to escape his throat. <em> \u201c </em> Uh <em> . </em>Hi. Hello. Sir. It\u2019s\u2014it\u2019s an honor to meet you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Robin snorts, and Tim <em> swears </em>he sees the corner of Batman\u2019s mouth twitch microscopically.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHello,\u201d Batman says gently. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to meet you, too. Can you tell me where it hurts?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cMy\u2014my leg,\u201d Tim stammers, then corrects himself, \u201cmy ankle.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Batman purses his lips and nods, shuffling backwards. Tim doesn\u2019t see what he plans on doing because Robin is quick to dart into his field of vision, giving him a blinding smile. Up close, Tim can see details about the new hero that don\u2019t come clearly through the lens of his camera.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>His hair is curly, spilling out in all directions from both the wind and what Tim expects is its natural state. Scaly panties have been replaced with a pair of scaly shorts, though much of the costume remains the same. He\u2019s not much older than Tim is (ten years, two months, and four days, thank you very much) but they\u2019re about the same size, with stick thin limbs and a pale complexion.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>But Robin has a healthy blush on his cheeks that speaks of healing and the broadness of his shoulders speaks of a growth spurt in the near future, where as Tim has been four feet and three inches and weighing around sixty pounds since he was eight.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHey, kiddo! So, with you being unconscious and all, we weren\u2019t able to stick a name to your face,\u201d Robin says cheerfully, innocently shuffling when Tim tries to lean and look past him and at whatever Batman is doing.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tim startles at the question and blushes furiously. Mother would be horrified to know all it took was a bump to head for him to forget his manners.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHi, Robin,\u201d he says shyly, rewarded when the hero\u2019s smile softens. \u201cI\u2019m Tim. Timothy Drake, if you need my full name, but I like to go by Tim.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Robin ruffles his hair, and Tim promptly swears to never wash it again. \u201cNice to meet you, kiddo. I\u2019m Robin, obviously. Don\u2019t know anyone else dressing up like a traffic light in this city.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t jinx us,\u201d Tim hears Batman mutter, shocking him into a short burst of laughter. Robin glances over his shoulder to stick his tongue out, and then nods at something Tim can\u2019t see.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, Tim-not-Timothy,\u201d carefully, Robin slings his arm behind Tim\u2019s back and under his knees, springing up from his crouch without any hindrance, snickering at Tim\u2019s yelp, \u201clet\u2019s go get you fixed up, yeah?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>In the car ride to someone named Leslie, Tim learns a few enlightening pieces of information.<br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>\u201cYou <em> ran me over </em>?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Robin winces and points desperately at Batman in the front seat. \u201cTechnically, since he was the one driving, it\u2019s his fault.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tim pauses. Considers. Then he turns to Batman with his fiercest scowl, perfectly modeled after his mother\u2019s. \u201cYou ran me over! How <em> could you? </em>\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI know,\u201d Batman says gravely, and his tone doesn\u2019t change but Tim gets the feeling he\u2019s hunching his shoulders\u2026just, on the inside. \u201cI am fully aware you could have had more severe injuries than your ankle, and I can\u2019t stress enough how sorry I am for hurting you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The Batmobile takes a sharp right turn, somehow not jostling Tim at all despite the speed it\u2019s going at. He doesn\u2019t recognize any of the buildings they drive past, the mysterious Dr. Thompkins most likely residing in the part of Gotham Tim doesn\u2019t dare enter at night.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, you <em> should </em> be sorry,\u201d Tim snaps, and then regrets it when Batman doesn\u2019t say anything to defend himself. He bits his lip. He shouldn\u2019t feel bad, <em> he\u2019s </em> the one that got run over. How is he supposed to explain his ankle to his parents?</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em> Sorry mom and dad, the Batmobile ran me over while I was stalking Batman and Robin in the dead of night to take pictures of them. Which actually brings me to a question I\u2019ve been wanting to ask you guys for a while now: can I go to this cool photography camp I found online? </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Right. Like that would go over well.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>But, still. Manners are manners, after all, and Tim has been stepping all over his since the moment he woke up.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201c...It\u2019s alright,\u201d Tim mumbles, choosing to stare out the window instead of making eye contact in the rear view mirror. \u201cYou didn\u2019t hurt me too badly. I\u2019ve gotten more bruises from gym class. At least you didn\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tim sucks in a breath and jerks a hand to his chest. Beside him, Robin lets out a startled curse, asking him if something\u2019s wrong, if he\u2019s having trouble breathing, but all Tim can focus on is the way his camera case gives easily against his fingers, bending inwards far past the point it should be able to.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><em> I could've sworn I heard a loud crack </em>, Robin\u2019s voice echoes in his ears.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Ice floods his veins.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Robin has moved his face close to Tim\u2019s, mouth moving urgently and pressing gloved fingers against his thundering pulse point on his neck. Tim ignores him, unzipping his hoodie and cradling his camera case in his hands. Batman\u2019s concerned voice has joined the fray, but Tim ignores that, too.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>For all the noise the two are creating, the zipper sliding open is somehow what rings loudest in his ears.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The soft tinkle of glass falling out is a close second though.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>-\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tim\u2019s first impression of Doctor Leslie Thompkins is that she is not a woman easily caught off guard. When the door to her clinic opens and she looks up, there\u2019s not one inch of her that seems phased at the image of Batman and Robin at her front step. If anything, Tim would say she looked annoyed.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>That annoyance eases when her eyes land on Tim and the sloppily made splint Batman had made for his ankle.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tim\u2019s second impression of Dr. Thompkins is that she takes no shit. She leads their small group to an unoccupied room to wait in until she\u2019s ready to see them, and gives Batman a look that could curdle milk as she sternly tells Batman to \u201cnot even <em> think </em> about moving your leathery ass away from this room, I swear to god if you vanish into the night and leave me alone with a patient without telling me anything, I\u2019m going to kick your ass. And I <em> will </em> win\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tim thinks they\u2019ll get along splendidly.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The room Dr. Thompkins shows them to has pastel green walls and is smaller than the kitchen in Drake Manor. The bed she instructs Tim to hop onto is too tall for him to get on by himself, let alone with a busted ankle.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>When Batman twitches like he\u2019s thinking of offering his assistance, Tim throws him a venomous look and pointedly asks Robin for his help.\u00a0</p>\n<p><br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>When Dr. Thompkins steps back in a few minutes later, the room is painfully silent. She looks at Batman, brooding in the darkest corner, then Robin, swinging his legs atop the same bed Tim is on and nervously glancing between his mentor and the boy next to him, and then finally her eyes land on Tim, quietly fuming, arms crossed in front of his chest, and glaring hellfire at the current source of his rage.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s more tension in here than my back,\u201d Dr. Thompkins says as the door swings shut behind her, drawing every eye to her immediately. She flicks her eyes around the room before choosing to settle on Tim, stepping forward until she\u2019s right next to his bed. \u201cIs everything alright?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>As Tim draws himself up as straight as he can without dislodging her grip on his throbbing ankle, Robin lets out a quiet groan beside him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAs a matter of fact,\u201d Tim says loudly, ignoring how Robin collapses onto his back and throws an arm over his eyes, \u201ceverything is <em> not </em> alright. This man, this man right here,\u201d he stabs a finger at Batman, who stares back with an air of guilty exasperation, \u201che is the cause of all this. I insist you send him to jail immediately.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Dr. Thompkins blinks slowly, momentarily pausing her prodding. \u201cWell, I\u2019m not a cop so\u2026no. But if there\u2019s a reason you feel unsafe with him in the room, you can tell me and I can kick him out.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOh boy, here we go,\u201d Robin mutters, but Tim can\u2019t bother to acknowledge him right now because the only thing in him right now is rage, clawing a home into his stomach and settling in. He puffs out his cheeks and stabs more vigorously at Batman, wishing for something to throw at him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHe broke my camera!\u201d Tim wails, incensed. \u201cNot a crack, not a dent; it\u2019s nothing but a pile of glass because he <em> broke it </em>!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd his ankle,\u201d Robin adds.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201c<em> And my ankle! </em>\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201c...I accidentally hit him with my car,\u201d Batman reluctantly offers when Dr. Thompkins raises her eyebrow at him, causing her to choke on her next breath. \u201cBut I managed to mostly swerve away once I noticed him, so I think he only got clipped,\u201d he adds over Tim\u2019s loud scoff.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cBut we\u2019re all in agreement that <em> something\u2019s </em>up with his ankle,\u201d Robin contributes, finally sitting up to throw an arm around Tim, who couldn\u2019t quite manage to hide his flinch in time. Robin freezes, then starts to slowly withdraw and Tim\u2014Tim\u2014</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>(The last time his parents had left at the calling of another dig, they\u2019d been playful, flushed with excitement. His dad had twirled his mom as Tim brought down their luggage, gently dipping her as she shook with laughter. Their touches with him had been gentle and fleeting, a hand squeezing his shoulder from Dad and a quick kiss pressed against his hair before they swept out of the door and were off to the airport.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>That was almost two months ago.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tim understood. Really, he did! Their work was important and he was in his double digits now, nearly eleven, give or take a handful of months. He didn\u2019t need a hug. He didn\u2019t need his parents to hold his hand every time he was injured.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>And yet.)</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tim fists his hand in Robin\u2019s cape and tentatively leans into the arm, bumping shoulders with the hero. A moment later, the arm settles back down and Tim relaxes. When he looks up, he finds Dr. Thompkins and Batman looking at him with an unreadable expression.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWell,\u201d Dr. Thompkins says before Tim can work himself into a panic, tucking her hands into the pockets on her scrubs, \u201cI can tell you now that your ankle is most definitely not broken, Tim. Badly sprained? Absolutely. But not broken.\u201d She sends him a tired smile that Tim returns, more than a little relieved. The one saving grace in this whole incident is that he won\u2019t have to explain how he broke his ankle to his parents. \u201cI\u2019ll write you up for some pain medication in case it starts to hurt or you bump it on something, but I highly recommend you RICE it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s an acronym,\u201d Robin explains when Tim stares blankly at her. \u201cStands for Rest, Ice, Compress, and Elevate.\u201d Dr. Thompkins nods along with his words, snatching a post-it note from the nearby desk and scribbling his words down before handing it to Tim.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll go get you those pains meds now. Batman,\u201d she says, tone chilling considerably, and Tim wonders if he imagined the slight flinch from the man, \u201cwould you please accompany me? I\u2019d like a word with you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It\u2019s not a question, no matter how it\u2019s phrased like one.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Batman willingly walks out the door she holds open for him and with a soft click, the room is empty of adults.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSo?\u201d Robin nudges him gently, earning himself a puzzled glance from Tim. \u201cWhat\u2019s really going on?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about,\u201d Tim denies immediately.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Robin gives him a flat look. \u201cLook Timbit,\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201c<em> Timbit? </em>\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2014don\u2019t go around telling people this, but I was an alley kid. Deflecting with anger to hide whatever you\u2019re really feeling? I\u2019ve got that shit on lock. I practically invented that move. And you\u2019ve had this look in your eyes since the moment I told you how you got your injuries.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tim stays silent as a grave, forcing his hand to let go of Robin\u2019s cape so he can clasp both of his own in his lap, like the polite young socialite his parents taught him to be. Robin makes a noise of protest before cutting himself off.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201c...Look,\u201d Robin starts slowly, and out of the corner of his eyes Tim can see him drumming his free hand on his thigh. \u201cI know I\u2019m not\u2014the Robin you\u2019re used to. I\u2019m practically a stranger to you. But.\u201d Robin pauses and Tim chances a glance upwards, watching as flashes of uncertainty, determination, and deep concern play out across his face. Tim ducks his head back down, but he can\u2019t block out the soft, full-body squeeze Robin gives him. \u201cBut I\u2019m still <em> a </em> Robin. And as long as I am, you\u2019re safe, okay? You\u2019re safe with me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tim fiddles with the bottom of his shirt, keeping his eyes there to hide the way his vision has started to become blurry. \u201cIt\u2019s just\u2014\u201d voice cracking, Tim huddles further into the arm around his shoulders. \u201cHe hurt me. Batman <em> hurt </em>me. He\u2019s not\u2014he\u2019s not supposed to do that! He was supposed to be safe, but. But he hurt me, too.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>So close together, Tim can feel the way the older boy tenses. A small sob hiccups out of his throat, prompting Robin to wrap his other arm around him, squeezing him tightly.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, kiddo,\u201d Robin sighs, tone filled with regret, \u201cit honestly was an accident\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>(His mother, holding a bag of frozen peas to the bruise on his cheek the same size as his father\u2019s fist. <em> It was an accident </em> , she says sternly, tutting at the soft whimper that escapes Tim\u2019s throat when she presses down too hard. <em> It\u2019s going to be hard to see you like this, so you need to cover it with make-up. You don\u2019t want to make your father sad now, do you? </em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tim shakes his head and earns himself an approving nod and a pat on the head.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The next morning, when his father absentmindedly remembers to apologize after some prompting from Mother, his mouth tastes like ash when he says, <em> It\u2019s okay, Dad. Of course I forgive you. </em>)</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2014but I bet that doesn\u2019t mean much, does it?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Clenching his eyes, Tim tucks his face into the curve of Robin\u2019s neck and shakes his head vigorously.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><em> No </em> , Tim thinks around the stinging pain of betrayal, <em> it really doesn\u2019t </em>.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>-\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>By the time Dr. Thompkins and Batman come back into the room, Tim\u2019s brief crying session (long overdue, according to Robin, who remains astounded Tim hadn\u2019t burst into tears the moment he found out he got hit by a car) is over and done with. In an attempt to keep a second round of tears at bay, Robin has taken to telling stories about Batman\u2019s greatest mishaps. Some he\u2019d experienced personally, and some had been passed down to him from the previous Robin.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd so I walk into the Batcave, and this man is head-to-toe covered in bat shit,\u201d Robin is saying, and Tim, snickering too hard to do anything but listen attentively, doesn\u2019t notice the door opening. \u201cI freeze on the spot of course, but he doesn\u2019t even stop to say anything to me, just walks straight to the weapons case, grabs a bow and arrow that I didn\u2019t even know we <em> had </em> , much less that he knew how to <em> use it </em>, and he finally sees me standing there, and you know what he tells me? You wanna know what he tells me?</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Tim wheezes, a few stray giggles bursting out. \u201cWhat did he say?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Deeping his voice, Robin gives Tim a faux somber face while miming notching a bow and says, \u201cThese motherfuckers are gonna learn today.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Over Tim\u2019s unrestrained peals of laughter, he hears a soft sigh come from the doorway. \u201cYou always do this. Why do you insist on telling that story to everyone you see?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI feel like it really explains you as a person,\u201d Robin fires back cheerfully, shooting Batman finger guns at the flat, unamused stare he\u2019s given. Tim watches the man carefully, smile fading slightly, but he doesn\u2019t seem angry. Whatever Dr. Thompkins said to him doesn\u2019t seem to have had a lasting affect.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHere you are, kid.\u201d Speak of the devil and she shall appear. Tim blinks, accepting the white bag held out to him. \u201cTake one tablet once a day for three weeks. If the pain continues past then, then come back and I\u2019ll take another look at it. That sound okay to you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, Dr. Thompkins.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cLook at that, no fuss, no \u2018I don\u2019t need pain meds\u2019, just taking the word of his doctor to make sure his health is the best it can be.\u201d Leslie sends a sharp pointed glance at the corner Batman has slipped back into. \u201c<em> Some </em> people could stand to learn a thing or two.\u201d Batman moves his head in a way Tim is 50% sure means he just rolled his eyes under his mask.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>With one more stern glance his way, she grants Robin and Tim one last smile as she gathers her things. \u201cWe\u2019re all done here, so feel free to use this room for as long as you need before leaving. Good night, everyone. Feel free to drop by anytime, though preferably without an injury.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He runs her words over in his head as he waves her goodbye, tucking the post-it note from her into a side pocket on his busted camera case, still slung around his neck. What reason would they have to stay any longer than necessary?</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Robin jumps off the bed first, stretching and shaking out his legs before turning to offer an arm to Tim. Getting down is more of a hassle than getting up was; Tim is already dreading going back to his empty house. He\u2019ll have to camp out in the downstairs living room, going up and down the stairs for food would just irritate his foot and lengthen the healing process. He\u2019d like to have the rolly chair in his room for easy movement, but that was upstairs, which meant it was inaccessible. Maybe he could\u2014</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>A slight clearing of the throat was what finally made him aware of the shadowed figure towering over him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tim sucked in a sharp breath and automatically went to step behind Robin, who\u2019s taller height would hopefully shield him. He made the mistake of putting weight on his sprained ankle, though, and had to quickly stifle a pained yelp as his leg crumbled beneath him, only saved from toppling over due to Robin\u2019s lightning fast reflexives.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Across from him, Batman took a hasty step back, and then one more when Tim still didn\u2019t relax, clutching Robin\u2019s arm tightly. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Batman\u2019s tone was stilted, like he was reading off cue cards. \u201cI did not intend for this to happen, but nonetheless it did. I\u2019m sorry. I should have been paying more attention to the road. I\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Batman clenched and opened his fists repeatedly, blowing out a heavy breath that sagged his shoulders. Tim\u2019s eyes widened when the man slowly lowered himself to the ground, kneeling on one leg. Even with height bent in half, Batman still had an inch or two on Tim, but at least like this they were more or less at eye level.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Batman\u2019s deep voice said earnestly, \u201cfor hurting you. You don\u2019t have to forgive me, and I understand if you decide to hate me for the rest of your life. I will replace your camera, of course\u2014\u201d Robin loudly clearing his throat halted his next words, and Batman quickly amended, \u201cThough I am aware that the emotional significance is beyond my power to return to you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tim studied the man in front of him carefully. What little the cowl didn\u2019t cover seemed sincere. His lips were pursed ever so slightly in what Tim was starting to think was true regret. Looking to Robin for what he should do brought no help whatsoever, the older boy just staring back at him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Decidedly, Tim pressed his hand against Batman\u2019s massive shoulder.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re not the worst,\u201d Tim told him solemnly, giving him a firm pat before taking away his hand.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>This time, Tim was <em> sure </em>he saw Batman\u2019s mouth twitch. \u201cI\u2019ll take it.\"\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>-</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Back inside the Batmobile, Batman driving like he was in three separate car chases at the same time, Robin turned sideways and said, \u201cSo. I can\u2019t help but wonder who on earth allowed an eight year old\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cTen. I\u2019m ten. Did I not mention that? I am definitely not eight years old.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2014a five year old\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201c<em> Robin</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2014I\u2019m just going to go lower every time you interrupt,\u201d Robin said, dodging Tim\u2019s punch to his shoulder without letting his shit-eating grin drop an inch. \u201cAs I was saying, who let a toddler go out into Gotham in the middle of the night? I\u2019d like to have a few words with your caretaker. Don\u2019t be alarmed if some of those words leave bruises.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, no bruises,\u201d Batman scolds, sending a narrowed glare through the rearview mirror. Tim tilts his head at both of them.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYour nanny should have kept a better eye on you, Tim,\u201d Batman explains, making a U-turn Tim is fairly certain is illegal. \u201cIt\u2019s dangerous for a child to be wandering the streets of Gotham alone, much less at night.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tim blinks slowly.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cUmm,\u201d he says hesitantly, glancing between the two heroes. \u201cWhat nanny?\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Robin shoots him a befuddled look. \u201c<em> ...Your </em> nanny? The person who takes care of you while you\u2019re away? Or are your parents home?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, they should be in Guatemala right now,\u201d Batman refutes before Tim can. He nods anyway when Robin turns to him to check.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, they\u2019re not home right now,\u201d Tim confirms. \u201cBut there\u2019s also no nanny. Did someone tell you guys I had a nanny?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>For a moment, there\u2019s total silence.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cTim,\u201d Batman finally says, \u201cwho looks after you while your parents are away?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tim rolls his eyes. \u201cNo one? Come on, guys. I\u2019m ten years old, but I\u2019m basically eleven, which is practically fifteen, which means I\u2019m essentially already <em>eighteen</em>, and should therefore be treated like an adult.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201c...Yeah, I\u2019m gonna need whatever trampoline you just used to jump through all those hoops,\u201d Robin says after a moment of staring.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The Batmobile comes to a screeching halt. When Tim glances outside his window, he\u2019s surprised to see Drake Manor, just as dark as he\u2019d left it. It feels like no time at all has passed since they left Dr. Thompkins clinic.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cTim,\u201d Batman says, drawing his attention. \u201cDo you mean to tell me there\u2019s absolutely no one inside that house right now? No one who can make sure you get the help you need with your ankle the way it is right now?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tim squirms in his seat, crossing his arms across his chest. He doesn\u2019t understand what seems to be the problem. What does it matter if there's no one but him at home? Tim can take care of himself. He\u2019s been doing so for as long as he can remember. \u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cTim.\u201d Batman fully twists his chair around, coming face-to-face with Tim. \u201cYou understand I can\u2019t just let you go inside knowing that you\u2019d be alone, right?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d Tim bursts out, clenching his fists and hunching further into himself. \u201cI\u2019m fine on my own. I\u2019m very independent, I don\u2019t need my parents to watch my back every second of the day.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re a child. Children should have someone to look after them, especially when they\u2019re injured.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSo what\u2019s your plan? You gonna call my parents? Tell them they need to be on the next flight out to Gotham?</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cActually,\u201d Robin coughs delicately, drawing both of their attention, \u201cI might have a better idea.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Batman stares at his partner uncomprehendingly. Carefully, Robin tilts his head ever so slightly to the right.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>When Tim tries to follow his line of thought, his eyes are drawn to Wayne Manor in the distance, shining like a beacon.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Across from him, Batman hums consideringly.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>-</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cJason\u2019s room is just across the hall, and mine is two doors down if you need me,\u201d Actual Real Life Bruce Wayne says to him, passing on a small pile of pajamas that used to belong to Jason and a new toothbrush before opening the door to the guest room that\u2019ll be Tim\u2019s for the night. Or however long it\u2019ll be until Tim gets to go back home.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The room, at least, is beautiful. The bed is gigantic with a mattress Tim is slightly afraid will be all too easy to sink into and never come out of. The window curtains are drawn closed, preventing the early morning dawn light from crawling through. Actual Real Life Bruce Wayne points out a door near the bed.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThat right there is the bathroom, and the door next to the desk is the closet,\u201d Bruce explains too cheerfully for the dead tired look in his eyes. It must be hell to have to keep yourself up after a long night of crime-fighting, Tim thinks as he watches Actual Real Life Bruce Wayne scrub a hand down his face with a yawn.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cTomorrow, we\u2019ll get your clothes and fill it up a bit. For now, try and get some sleep. I\u2019m sure you\u2019re tired. I\u2019ll leave a message for your parents about what Batman told me before I drop off into la-la-land myself.\u201d With another yawn, Bruce sends him a gentle smile that looks a touch more real than the ones Tim\u2019s seen in the magazines his mother likes to read and sees himself out.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>For a long moment, Tim finds himself staring at the closed door, a pile of clothes in his arms, his phone in one pocket and his keys in another, and a shattered mess that used to be his camera on his chest. It\u2019s not how he expected the night to end. It\u2019s not even close.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>But Bruce is right. Tim <em> is </em> tired. He changes into the borrowed pajamas quickly, suddenly aching to be swallowed by the warm, comfortable-looking bed waiting for him. He brushes his teeth and his hair, and makes sure his small handful of items are all on the desk right alongside his clothes before he lets himself crawl into bed.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>A heavy sigh leaves him as he relaxes into the pillows, eyes heavy. He has no idea what\u2019s going to happen now, with his parents, with the fact that he\u2019s apparently living with Batman and Robin for the time being. But now isn\u2019t the time for that.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tim blinks once, twice, and on the third blink, his eyes close and don\u2019t open again.</p>"
