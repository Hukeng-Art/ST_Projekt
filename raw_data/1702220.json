  "summary": "<p>Stiles and Derek have been close friends since the Hale siblings moved in next door after their parents' death. But Derek's in the popular group, he's a star baseball player, and he dates popular Pep Squad captain Jennifer Blake. Stiles doesn't have any of that, just his skateboard and a hopeless crush on Derek (oh yeah, and his Vote Lydia Martin Prom Queen button). As prom and the baseball state championship grow closer, Stiles and Derek start rekindling their friendship.</p>\n<p>And it all begins with two white boards.</p>",

  "text": "<p>Stiles drags his eyes away from <i>The Scarlet Letter</i>, three chapters of which are due tomorrow, but he thinks if he reads one more sentence about Hester Prynne his eyes are going to fall out of his head. He rubs them wearily before glancing around the room for a distraction. He finds one right outside the window.</p>\n<p>In the house next door, in the room whose window is so close Stiles can almost reach out and touch it, he sees Derek pacing back and forth. His cell phone is glued to his ear, his hand running through his hair every few moments which causes it to stand up in a state of general disarray. Stiles frowns as he watches the scene, because it reflects two things he hates:</p>\n<p>1. Derek\u2019s stupid hair looks so cute and touchable, which does nothing to help Stiles\u2019 hopeless crush.<br>\n2. Derek\u2019s fighting with his horrid girlfriend, Jennifer. </p>\n<p>Okay, so maybe <i>horrid</i> is a bit of a strong word, but it\u2019s been programmed into him over the years. It\u2019s not Stiles\u2019 fault that Lydia Martin and Jennifer Blake are the two most popular girls in school, and naturally, bitter rivals for everything. And when it comes to choosing sides, Stiles is one thousand and twenty seven point four percent Team Lydia. And it\u2019s not just because Stiles was in love with Lydia until last year when he realized he was actually interested in both cocks and vaginas, which really had nothing to do with Lydia. Lydia was actually pretty great through that whole teenage existential crisis thing. </p>\n<p>Lydia may act flighty and be terrifying, but Stiles knows she\u2019s smarter than anyone else \u2013 including himself \u2013 with a heart of gold. If she liked you. And, to be fair, Lydia didn\u2019t like many people. But neither did Stiles, so that was another point in her book.</p>\n<p>Jennifer Blake, though? Fake, mean, manipulative, and possibly evil. Stiles is betting witch, if things like witches existed. She hates Stiles\u2019 guts, and not just because of Lydia. Stiles thinks it has something to do with him and Derek being friends, even though it\u2019s not something they advertise at school. </p>\n<p>Sure, Stiles and Derek were like BFFs back when the Hale siblings moved in next door with crazy Uncle Peter after Derek\u2019s parents died in a car accident. They spent Stiles\u2019 summer between eighth and ninth grade riding bikes and playing baseball in the nearby park. But that was right before Stiles went to high school. That fall, Stiles started his freshman year with a scraped knee and a buzz cut. Derek entered his new school as a sophomore, and the popular crowd snapped Derek up real quick. That didn\u2019t surprise Stiles; Derek had all the makings of a jock, and had gone all the way to the other side of puberty where he had lean muscle and sported a constant five o\u2019clock shadow. Stiles was still uncoordinated, and all puberty had given him was pimples and a near constant boner. </p>\n<p>Derek didn\u2019t completely drop Stiles and still hung out with him sometimes, when Derek wasn\u2019t out with his popular friends in his shiny new Camaro. And by the time Stiles had gotten his old, beat up Jeep, cleared up his acne, grown out his hair, and realized he liked boys, Jennifer Blake had snapped up Derek. </p>\n<p>That just made Stiles hate her more. Not because she dated Derek \u2013 Stiles wasn\u2019t stupid enough to think Derek was into guys or would be into him even if he was \u2013 but because Derek deserved better than someone so self-centered. </p>\n<p>But Stiles was the one home alone every Friday night and desperately single, so maybe he shouldn\u2019t be so hard on Derek. At least Derek was getting some. Even if it was from Jennifer.</p>\n<p>Stiles sees Derek throw his hands up and yell something into the phone. Stiles pushes himself off the bed and walks over to the window. He bends down, grabs the worn white board he keeps beneath the window, and writes in large letters, <i>EVERYTHING OKAY?</i></p>\n<p>Stiles flips it around and holds it in front of the window. After a few moments, Derek catches sight of him. He comes closer to the window and reads the words. A wide smile breaks out across his face. He disappears for a moment as he bends down, reappearing a few seconds later holding a similar white board. Stiles watches as Derek cradles his cell phone between his ear and shoulder while scribbling a response. Using one hand, he flips it around.</p>\n<p>\n<i>Fight with Jen.</i>\n</p>\n<p><i>Anything I can do?</i> </p>\n<p>Derek shakes his head, and Stiles gives him a small, encouraging smile. Then, Derek writes, <i>So tired of drama.</i></p>\n<p><i>Sorry :(,</i> Stiles writes on his board. Derek nods, then turns away from the window and resumes his pacing with tense shoulders. Stiles watches him for a few moments, sighing.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo drama here,\u201d Stiles says quietly to himself. \u201cA drama free zone, that\u2019s me.\u201d </p>\n<p>Derek laughs at something Jennifer said, and Stiles drops back onto the bed, staring at the ceiling. He knows this unrequited crush thing was getting old; maybe when Derek graduates in a few months, it would get better. </p>\n<p>Stiles still has one final year of high school to be lame and single, though. </p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>The April sun is hot, even if a cool breeze blows around them. Stiles is bent over his sketch pad, pencil scratching across the paper in attempt to get the curl of Allison\u2019s hair just right. </p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s almost perfect,\u201d Lydia says from behind him, where she\u2019s lounging across the bleachers and reading a book in between idly watching the baseball team practice. \u201cI think her eyes are off though.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhen did you become an art critic?\u201d Stiles asks, turning his head from side to side as he concedes that Allison\u2019s eyes aren\u2019t quite right. He erases them.</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t be so sensitive,\u201d Lydia says. \u201cIf you ever want to become an artist, you\u2019re going to have to develop a thicker skin.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to be an artist,\u201d Stiles says as he starts carefully sketching eyes from memory. \u201cI just like to draw.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHeads up!\u201d someone calls a second after the crack of a bat connecting with a ball, and Stiles looks up just in time to see the baseball land a few feet down the bleachers. \u201cDammit, I was aiming for Stilinski,\u201d Jackson yells.</p>\n<p>\u201cYour aim sucks,\u201d Stiles yells as he gets up and climbs over bleachers to grab the baseball. \u201cActually, all of you sucks, Jackson.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t suck,\u201d Jackson says, \u201cBut there are parts of me that don\u2019t mind getting sucked.\u201d</p>\n<p>Danny rolls his eyes as the twins high five Jackson. Stiles glances over at Lydia, who either doesn\u2019t hear the comment or chooses to ignore it. Not for the first time, Stiles wonders just why in the hell Lydia is with Jackson. Jackson walks further down the field as Stiles jogs down the bleachers with the ball in hand. Derek\u2019s the one who comes to the fence.</p>\n<p>\u201cThanks,\u201d Derek says with an easy smile. The brim of his cap shades his face, and he\u2019s sweaty and dirty in his practice uniform. </p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t know why you keep him on the team,\u201d Stiles says as he hands Derek the ball. \u201cWhen you go to state, you should leave him there.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek laughs. \u201cJust ignore him. That\u2019s what we do.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cEasy for you to say. He hasn\u2019t been tormenting you since kindergarten.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe has a mean fastball,\u201d Derek says with a shrug. \u201cIt\u2019s the only reason we keep him around.\u201d He grins and jogs back onto the field. Scott sees Stiles by the fence from third base, and he waves enthusiastically. Stiles returns the wave before going back to his seat.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhen are you going to get rid of your crush?\u201d Lydia asks. \u201cYou deserve better.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI know,\u201d Stiles replies as he watches Derek hunching at second base, waiting for the next batter to swing. Stiles can\u2019t help it; he can\u2019t resist the way Derek looks in his baseball uniform. The way those pants cling to his thighs and ass should be illegal.</p>\n<p>Stiles sketches for the next hour while the team practices. He doesn\u2019t stop until he hears heavy footsteps bounding up the bleachers accompanied by loud voices. Stiles looks up as Allison, Kira, and Cora make their way towards them, still dressed in their softball gear with duffle bags hanging on their shoulders.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey,\u201d Allison greets as she takes the space beside Stiles, and Stiles hurriedly flips the sketchpad to a fresh sheet. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNothing,\u201d Stiles says. \u201cNothing to see here.\u201d</p>\n<p>Allison smirks and says, \u201cWhatever you say, Stiles.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t ruin the surprise of your graduation present, Allison. Enjoy the anticipation!\u201d Stiles says. \u201cHow was practice?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHarris is a slave-driver,\u201d Cora complains, falling back against Stiles and resting her head on his thigh. She looks up at him. \u201cHe\u2019s going to kill us.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that bad,\u201d Kira says. \u201cWe\u2019ve never made it to regionals before. He\u2019s a good coach.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cToo bad we lost,\u201d Cora snipes. \u201cWhich doesn\u2019t even save us from practice.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ve still got that invitational,\u201d Allison states.</p>\n<p>\u201cCoach is just making sure we\u2019re ready! Those teams are good. We\u2019re lucky to have been invited,\u201d Kira says.</p>\n<p>\u201cShut up,\u201d Cora groans. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t ride your ass like mine.\u201d Stiles smiles as he listens to Cora and Kira argue about their coach, and Lydia and Allison talk softly behind him.</p>\n<p>Stiles is idly sketching Cora lying on him and Kira eating a granola bar beside her when he hears Lydia make an unpleasant sound behind him. He looks up to see the Pep Squad striding out onto the field, led by Jennifer.</p>\n<p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know <i>she</i> was going to be here,\u201d Lydia says. \u201cI thought I\u2019d be spared her repugnant face today.\u201d Jennifer and the rest of the team spend the next fifteen minutes practicing a new set up for the upcoming state championship, and Lydia mutters insults under her breath. </p>\n<p>When Derek comes to bat, Stiles, Cora, and Kira start clapping and yelling excitedly. Derek turns their way and squints into the sun, giving them a wave and a grin when he spots them.</p>\n<p>\u201cCome on, Derek!\u201d Stiles yells.</p>\n<p>\u201cGo bro!\u201d Cora screams. </p>\n<p>\u201cYou can do it!\u201d Kira adds.</p>\n<p>As if on cue, Jennifer leads the Pep Squad into a cheer. Derek waves to her, and she blows him a kiss. Stiles rolls his eyes. When Derek swings, he hits the ball deep into the outfield, and then it sails over the fence. Stiles, Cora, and Kira jump to their feet, and even Allison and Lydia stand. They clap and make too much noise, and Derek turns and laughs at them. </p>\n<p>Then, Jennifer runs across the field and jumps into Derek\u2019s arms and kisses him. Cora pretends to barf beside Stiles, and Stiles has to appreciate her. She probably hates Jennifer more than Stiles.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Stiles works three afternoons and Saturday mornings at the local record shop, Revolution, though everyone just calls it The Rev for short. He lucked into the job two years ago when Derek\u2019s older sister Laura, who used to have Stiles\u2019 job, graduated and convinced the owner to hire Stiles in her place. Stiles loves Laura, he really does.</p>\n<p>Stiles walks into the store and stuffs his hoodie into his bag, leaving him in his vintage The Cars t-shirt that the owner gave him. \u201cIf I see you in that fake Target music tee bullshit again, you\u2019re fired,\u201d he\u2019d told Stiles as he shoved the t-shirt in Stiles\u2019 hands, and Stiles had just nodded mutely. He really didn\u2019t think anyone would care that much about a Beatles shirt gotten for $2 on the Target clearance rack, but apparently, some people cared very much.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey,\u201d Stiles greets Erica and Isaac as he slides in behind the counter. They\u2019re both college students at the local community college, and pretty much attached at the hip. They\u2019ve sorta taken Stiles under their wing, which means they make fun of him and make him do all the shit jobs they don\u2019t want to do.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re gonna love the new tracks I found this morning,\u201d Erica says, hooking up her iPod. \u201cThe podcast my favorite blog runs was, ugh, I can\u2019t even describe it.\u201d Erica hits play as Isaac drags Stiles over to the boxes of new merchandise to start processing.</p>\n<p>Later, Erica is painting her nails and Isaac is playing an old Bush track on his guitar while Stiles trolls the music on Isaac\u2019s laptop. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Isaac asks after Stiles listens to the fifth random song in a row.</p>\n<p>\u201cMaking a mix CD,\u201d Stiles says. </p>\n<p>\u201cFor Derek?\u201d Isaac asks with a knowing smirk.</p>\n<p>Stiles feels his cheeks color. \u201cYeah.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAny luck in that department?\u201d Isaac asks, switching to a song that sounds suspiciously like the Beach Boys. </p>\n<p>\u201cDude, I\u2019ve told you, it\u2019s not like that. He\u2019s got a girlfriend.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHasn\u2019t stopped you yet,\u201d Isaac says, strumming a few more chords. </p>\n<p>\u201cIf you want him, go for it,\u201d Erica says, smacking her gum. \u201cGirlfriends and boyfriends are ephemeral anyway. It doesn\u2019t pay to get too attached. Life\u2019s too short to get too wrapped up in relationships.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou sound like some fucking hipster blog,\u201d Stiles says, \u201cWhich honestly, just about sums you up.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t be bitter because you\u2019re a teenage loser and I\u2019m just naturally awesome.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles rolls his eyes and goes back to iTunes.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been making him mix CDs as long as I\u2019ve known you,\u201d Isaac says.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd he makes me mixed CDs, too,\u201d Stiles snaps. \u201cIt\u2019s not like I\u2019m just some pathetic asshole slipping love notes into his locker. He gave me a CD a month ago; it\u2019s time I returned the favor.\u201d Isaac makes a humming noise. \u201cFuck off, Isaac.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTouchy.\u201d Isaac stares at Stiles thoughtfully as he plays the melody of \u201cDon\u2019t Worry Baby.\u201d </p>\n<p>First Lydia, now Isaac. Really, Stiles doesn\u2019t know why everyone is suddenly so interested in his crush. His friendship with Derek is\u2026well, it\u2019s them. It\u2019s always been like this.</p>\n<p>When Derek moved in next door to Stiles, he was a grumpy, sullen asshole. But, he\u2019d just lost his parents to a car crash, so Stiles forgave a lot that summer. The first few weeks, Derek just growled and glared when Stiles came by to see if he wanted to do something, like ride their bikes into town to grab ice cream or to the park for some baseball because his dad had told him Peter said Derek liked baseball. Maybe Stiles shouldn\u2019t have bothered the new kid with the dead parents so much, but Stiles knew what it was like to lose at least one parent; he was honestly just trying to help.</p>\n<p>Derek had barely looked at him until Stiles invited Derek to see a Dodgers game with him and his dad. Scott was supposed to go, but his dad had suddenly shown up, so Scott had to go spend the week in San Francisco with his douchebag dad, and Stiles had an extra Giants ticket. Derek looked reluctant, but Stiles had said, \u201cIt\u2019s the Giants vs. the Dodgers. Dude, you can\u2019t miss that! My dad said that your uncle said that the Dodgers were your <i>favorite</i>. And look, row four on the first base line. The sheriff\u2019s department doesn\u2019t play with their season pass tickets.\u201d Stiles had waved the ticket in front of Derek\u2019s eyes, and finally, Derek caved.</p>\n<p>He\u2019d been silent in the backseat while Stiles and the sheriff tried to talk to him, but when they\u2019d gotten to the field\u2026man, Derek just <i>lit up</i>. Stiles had to stop himself from staring because Derek was like a totally different person, his face open and awed and <i>smiling.</i> Stiles thought in that moment that Derek should always smile, and he made it his personal mission to make sure that happened.</p>\n<p>After that, Derek agreed to go to the park and into town on bicycles with Stiles. Stiles invited Derek\u2019s sisters, Cora and Laura, too. Even though Cora was the same age as Stiles, she was just angry and slammed doors and beat up neighborhood kids, while Laura, who was two years older than Derek, was awkward and stayed inside with a book and headphones on her head. </p>\n<p>So, for three months, it was just Stiles and Derek, and by the end of the summer, they were as close, if not closer, than him and Scott (mainly due to the fact that Scott had met one, Allison Argent, and had been lovesick all summer over the new girl in town. Well, that and the fact that he spent half the summer in San Francisco with his dad).</p>\n<p>In school they ran in completely different circles. Derek was the \u201cpopular group,\u201d and Stiles was not. Stiles\u2019 group started out with just him and Scott, but over the years it expanded to include Allison, Cora, and Kira. Lydia, for some reason, hung out with them sometimes even though she was also in the \u201cpopular group.\u201d Sure, Derek waved to Stiles and smiled when they passed in the halls, but most people didn\u2019t even realize they knew each other. Stiles was okay with this.</p>\n<p>Mainly because some weekends, Stiles and Derek still played baseball in the park, and sometimes at night they held conversations via white boards from their bedroom windows. And whenever Peter was being creepy (which was more often than not), Derek came over to Stiles\u2019 house for dinner.</p>\n<p>Too bad most of that stopped when Derek got a girlfriend. </p>\n<p>Stiles sighs. He shouldn\u2019t be surprised, really, because the same thing happened when Scott got a girlfriend. But the difference was that Allison got added to the Scott-and-Stiles show, whereas Derek just stayed Jennifer\u2019s Boyfriend.</p>\n<p>After Stiles burns the CD, he takes the sharpies littering the counter and decorates the CD. He writes across the top <i> Stiles\u2019 must-hear mix for Derek</i>.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Stiles doesn\u2019t get home until after nine because Isaac makes him close, so he\u2019s toeing off his shoes when he glances out of the window and sees Derek standing there with a whiteboard. Stiles gives him a small wave and steps closer to the window.</p>\n<p>\n<i>You\u2019re home late.</i>\n</p>\n<p>Stiles smiles and grabs his own whiteboard to scribble a response. <i>Work. What\u2019s up?</i> Stiles flips it around, and watches as Derek reads, his brows furrowing.</p>\n<p>\n<i>Nothing\u2019s up. Why?</i>\n</p>\n<p>\n<i>We just haven\u2019t done this much lately. Thought something might be wrong.</i>\n</p>\n<p>\n<i>Nothing wrong. Just saw your light, thought I\u2019d say hi.</i>\n</p>\n<p>Stiles looks up then, at Derek standing in his window wearing a t-shirt and gym shorts, and suddenly missed this, missed Derek. Missed their easy friendship. Stiles smiles and writes, <i>I\u2019m glad you did. How was your day?</i></p>\n<p>\n<i>Good. Hit another homer off Jackson. He was pissed, but Coach was ecstatic.</i>\n</p>\n<p>\n<i>AWESOME!!! :)</i>\n</p>\n<p>\n<i>How was work?</i>\n</p>\n<p><i>Fine. Erica let me listen to a new playlist, and I used Isaac\u2019s laptop to burn you a new mix.</i> Stiles disappears for a moment then holds up the slim case. </p>\n<p>Derek grins and writes, <i>Really? Bring it over! We can listen to it for a bit.</i></p>\n<p>Stiles drops the whiteboard to the floor, grabs the CD, stuffs his feet back into his sneakers, and hurries next door. He knocks, and is greeted by Derek\u2019s Uncle Peter. Who is wearing a white satin kimono.</p>\n<p>\u201cStiles!\u201d Peter exclaims, wide grin on his face. Stiles knows logically Peter isn\u2019t an <i>actual</i> creeper, but every time he sees Peter, he just gets creeper vibes. The man is\u2026just weird. \u201cI didn\u2019t know you\u2019d be visiting us tonight. Are you here for Derek or Cora?\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek luckily jogs down the stairs at that moment. \u201cUncle Peter, he\u2019s here to see me. I hope it\u2019s okay he\u2019s coming over so late?\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter smiles at Derek and shakes his head. \u201cOf course, Stiles is always welcome in our home. I\u2019ll leave you two boys to it then.\u201d Peter disappears into another room, leaving Stiles staring after him. </p>\n<p>\u201cCome on,\u201d Derek says, leading the way back upstairs. When they\u2019re inside his room, Derek closes the door behind them. \u201cSorry about Peter for his\u2026Peter-ness.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it,\u201d Stiles says, flopping back onto Derek\u2019s bed. \u201cHonestly, nothing Peter does surprises me anymore, especially after the time he spent that month at the nudist colony. Though, I wasn\u2019t expecting a kimono.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek rolls his eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s some new thing he\u2019s into. He\u2019s dating this woman, and they\u2019re trying to get balanced and do yoga and drink herbs or something. I don\u2019t know. I just roll my eyes and ignore Peter most of the time.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cProbably a good plan.\u201d Stiles grins and Derek sits on his desk chair. Stiles hands Derek the CD. \u201cNew mix for you. Way over due. You gave me yours like a month ago.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo worries,\u201d Derek smiles as he places the CD into his computer. \u201cYou\u2019re just making sure you have great songs for me!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, that\u2019s it,\u201d Stiles laughs. Stiles settles more comfortably on the bed as Derek pushes play. They spend a few minutes just listening to the song, Derek grabbing a baseball sitting on his desk and idly tossing it up into the air.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis CD is good,\u201d Derek says a few minutes later, eyes trained on the ball.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019ve only heard two songs.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTwo great songs.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles shakes his head as he rolls his eyes. \u201cYou like anything.\u201d </p>\n<p>Derek shrugs, not arguing. \u201cAre you excited for prom?\u201d he asks. \u201cGot a date yet?\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles laughs, he all out genuinely laughs at the ludicrous question. Derek grips the ball in his fist after he catches it and straightens in the desk chair to look at Stiles. \u201cThat\u2019s hilarious, Derek. Grade A quality comedy right there.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat? It\u2019s a legitimate question.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles picks at the comforter. \u201cYou know I don\u2019t have a prom date.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles cuts his eyes to Derek. \u201cWhat world are you living in that I would have a prom date?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut why wouldn\u2019t you have a prom date?\u201d Derek asks, and Stiles realizes he\u2019s absolutely <i>serious</i>. Derek legitimately thinks Stiles should have a prom date.</p>\n<p>\u201cDude, what guy is going to like me?\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek\u2019s brow furrows as he scowls. \u201cYou\u2019re an idiot,\u201d he says. \u201cAny guy who doesn\u2019t want you is an even bigger idiot.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, Beacon Hills is just full of eligible gay dudes for me to ask,\u201d Stiles drawls. \u201cLet\u2019s see, there\u2019s Danny and Ethan who, oh wait!, <i>are dating each other</i>. The only other guy remotely bisexual is Jared, and just, no. Not my type,\u201d Stiles finishes, shaking his head adamantly.</p>\n<p>\u201cMaybe Danny can set you up with someone,\u201d Derek suggests helpfully. Stiles rolls his eyes. \u201cOr maybe you can take Cora.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCora would break my arm just for asking.\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cI just want you to be happy, Stiles.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles huffs and pushes himself into a sitting position. \u201cSee, all you popular people are under the misconception that everyone needs to be <i>dating</i> to be happy. I\u2019m perfectly happy, you know. Yeah, I get lonely sometimes, and I\u2019d really like someone to play with my dingdong, but I don\u2019t need a boyfriend to be happy. I have Scott, who\u2019s the absolute best, and then the girls, which includes Lydia for some crazy reason. My theory is that Lydia only talks to me because all the rest of my friends are on the baseball or softball team, which makes them quasi-popular, and I\u2019m just that annoying non-popular hanger-on who she puts up with so she doesn\u2019t have to sit alone at practice while she waits on Jackson. Plus I dote on her, so she likes that, too.\u201d Stiles takes a breath and looks at Derek seriously. \u201cAnd I also have you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek smiles, and that makes Stiles\u2019 night.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Stiles is at work, alphabetizing the rockabilly section, when he hears the doorbell jingle. He\u2019s surprised when he sees Derek and Boyd striding inside, wearing letterman jackets despite the warm day.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey,\u201d Stiles greets. Derek smiles and approaches him, while Boyd steps nonchalantly towards a display as his eyes dart around the store. \u201cIs he here to see Erica?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYep,\u201d Derek says. They stand side by side as they watch Boyd drift closer and closer to the register, where Erica is flipping through a magazine and popping bubbles with her gum. \u201cHe\u2019s been raving about her.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHas he really?\u201d Stiles asks, turning towards Derek as Boyd finally makes it to the counter.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, he\u2019s mentioned her twice this week, and for him, that\u2019s raving.\u201d Derek glances at the records Stiles has in his hand. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d Stiles says, shoving them back into the rack. \u201cWasting time. These are the boring records. I can show you good records if you want to see good records.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles and Derek are sitting on the floor looking through a new donation of vintage records when Derek says, \u201cI have some good news.\u201d Stiles glances up from where he\u2019s already started separating and organizing the albums. \u201cI\u2019ve been talking to a few college recruiters.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFrom where?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOne from UC Irvine, one from a Midwest school, and another from the east coast. They\u2019re coming to watch me play in the state championship.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCool.\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cIf they like what they see, they might offer me a scholarship to play ball in college.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles\u2019 mouth drops open. \u201cDerek, that\u2019s amazing!\u201d He slaps Derek on the shoulder. \u201cDude! That\u2019s been your dream for, like, ever!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI know,\u201d Derek says, blushing and looking at his hands. \u201cI haven\u2019t told anyone about the recruiters yet.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWait, what?\u201d Stiles asks. \u201cNot even your sisters?\u201d Derek shakes his head. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cStiles, you were the first person I wanted to tell,\u201d Derek says, looking at Stiles seriously. \u201cThe other schools called earlier this week, but UC Irvine called last night. I would have called you then, but your light was already off and I didn\u2019t want to wake you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou wanted to tell me?\u201d Stiles still can\u2019t wrap his mind around it, that Derek hadn\u2019t wanted to tell his girlfriend, or Boyd, or even his sisters, but <i>him</i>.</p>\n<p>Derek rolls his eyes. \u201cDuh, you idiot. You\u2019ve always been my biggest supporter with baseball, spending hours in the park practicing with me and encouraging me when I almost gave up. You\u2019re probably the only reason anyone\u2019s interested in me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI think your natural talent has something to do with it,\u201d Stiles says, but his brain is reeling. Derek wanted to tell him, and Derek thought that about him. It\u2019s true, Stiles had spent hours helping Derek practice. Stiles loves baseball almost as much as Derek, he just has no natural affinity for sports. But Derek hadn\u2019t minded when Stiles tagged along and helped him play baseball, let the annoying uncoordinated kid practice alongside him. Stiles never knew he was actually helping Derek, or that Derek appreciated it or even noticed.</p>\n<p>\u201cStill,\u201d Derek says with a small smile. \u201cI\u2019m hoping that the guy from UC Irvine likes what he sees. That\u2019s where I want to go.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy there? Is their team better?\u201d Stiles asks.</p>\n<p>\u201cAll the teams are good,\u201d Derek states, \u201cbut\u2026I don\u2019t want to leave my sisters, you know? After everything that\u2019s happened, it just wouldn\u2019t feel right being more than a few hours away.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMakes sense,\u201d Stiles says. \u201cI have to say that selfishly, my vote is with the California school.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGood to know I have your approval,\u201d Derek jokes, pushing Stiles playfully. \u201cDon\u2019t tell anyone, not even Cora. I don\u2019t want to jinx it, but I had to tell you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI swear,\u201d Stiles promises.</p>\n<p>Long after Derek leaves, having to basically drag Boyd away from Erica, Stiles thinks about what Derek just told him. Even after the last few years, Derek and Stiles are still just as close, and Stiles thinks that, in the long run, being Derek\u2019s best friend is enough.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>\u201cHow did we get this shit duty?\u201d Stiles asks Scott as he tapes another poster with Lydia\u2019s smiling face onto a spot of blank wall. It\u2019s after school, and somehow Lydia had convinced the two of them to hang her prom queen campaign posters for her. \u201cWe both know how I got roped into this,\u201d Stiles says, because really, Lydia glaring at him while shoving a stack of posters into his arms and pointing to the wall was enough to get Stiles flailing in terror, \u201cbut how did she con you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAllison asked if I\u2019d help out Lydia because she\u2019s so stressed,\u201d Scott explains as he staples a poster to a bulletin board.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, <i>Allison</i> asked,\u201d Stiles mocks, and Scott shoves him.</p>\n<p>\u201cShut up,\u201d Scott mumbles. Stiles snickers. \u201cJackson said he got the party bus lined up for prom,\u201d he explains as they turn and walk down a different hall. \u201cYou in, man?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUgh, why is everyone obsessed with prom?\u201d Stiles groans dramatically.</p>\n<p>\u201cHuh? Dude, it\u2019s in a couple of weeks. It\u2019s all Allison\u2019s been talking about. She keeps showing me pictures of all these dresses and asking me which I like better,\u201d Scott says with a sigh. \u201cShe\u2019d look great in any of them, but she doesn\u2019t think that\u2019s an answer.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m taking the Jeep,\u201d Stiles says.</p>\n<p>\u201cStiles, you <i>have</i> to come in the party bus with us! There\u2019s plenty of room, and like, <i>everyone</i> is gonna be there, the baseball team, Allison, and even Kira because she\u2019s going with Greenburg, and Danny and Ethan, Derek\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHold up,\u201d Stiles spins about, his arms flailing. \u201cYou mean to tell me that Lydia and Jennifer are going to be on the same bus, bitter rivals for prom queen?\u201d Scott nods with a grin. \u201cYeah, cause <i>that</i> won\u2019t be a disaster or anything.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDerek\u2019s part of the baseball team, of course he\u2019s coming with us.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTen bucks, Jennifer charters her <i>own</i> limo with all her friends, and Derek ends up with her, Kali, Ennis, and even Aiden. Boyd might go with them, too, because where Derek is, Boyd is,\u201d Stiles says. \u201cJennifer and Lydia will not ride in the same limo, I guarantee it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Scott shrugs. \u201cI don\u2019t care. That\u2019s all stupid girl stuff, like why does it matter who\u2019s crowned prom queen? Everyone knows they\u2019re the most popular.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles shakes his head. \u201cIt\u2019s a good thing Allison loves you and she\u2019s not concerned with that kind of thing.\u201d</p>\n<p>Scott gets that dopey grin on his face. \u201cYeah, that\u2019s why Allison is the best.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThose signs should be illegal,\u201d Stiles hears from behind him. He turns around to see Kali walking down the hall, Ennis\u2019 arm slung around her shoulders. Kali is dressed in her Pep Squad outfit, and Ennis in his baseball uniform. \u201cNo one wants to see Martin\u2019s ugly face staring at them all day.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t be bitter because everyone knows Lydia\u2019s gonna win,\u201d Stiles says as he tapes up two posters side by side. \u201cYou don\u2019t see Lydia going around fretting.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t talk to my girl like that, loser, or I\u2019ll pummel you into the ground,\u201d Ennis barks out.</p>\n<p>Stiles rolls his eyes as he walks further down the hall. \u201cI\u2019m shaking, really.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou should be, Stalonzy,\u201d Ennis shouts.</p>\n<p>\u201cIf I see Stalonzy, I\u2019ll tell him to be terrified,\u201d Stiles shouts as he rounds a corner.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re gonna get your ass kicked,\u201d Scott points out. \u201cEnnis won\u2019t think twice about it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles shrugs. \u201cHe\u2019s looking for Stalonzy, not Stilinski,\u201d he jokes. \u201cI\u2019m safe.\u201d Scott rolls his eyes and hangs another poster.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Stiles doesn\u2019t always take his Jeep everywhere. The thing is great, god he loves her, but she\u2019s a gas guzzler and sometimes Stiles likes to use his miniscule paychecks for things <i>other</i> than filling up the Jeep\u2019s tank. So, he takes his skateboard just about everywhere. It\u2019s about the only thing remotely sporty that Stiles doesn\u2019t suck at.</p>\n<p>Friday night, Stiles skateboards into town and meets Erica and Isaac at the one dive bar that serves as a music venue. There\u2019s some indie band playing that Stiles has never heard of, and Erica got them tickets. It\u2019s an 18+ show, but the guy doesn\u2019t even glance at Stiles when he catches sight of Erica and her low-cut top.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome,\u201d she breathes into Stiles\u2019 ear as they enter. Stiles huffs out a laugh.</p>\n<p>Stiles feels kind of like a tool, standing in the middle of this bar holding a skateboard. However, most people are standing in pockets, involved in Really Important Conversations, while drinking or passing a joint between them, so Stiles thinks that no one is actually paying attention to him and his skateboard anyway.</p>\n<p>The opening band is surprisingly good. Stiles finds himself nodding along, and after their set, he goes and buys their CD. Isaac steals a table when a group of people go to the bathroom, so Stiles climbs onto one of the ridiculously tall stools and reads the liner notes on his new CD while he waits on the next band.</p>\n<p>\u201cBoo.\u201d Stiles jumps, and the CD case clatters across the table. Someone laughs to his right, and Stiles looks over to see Derek smirking. </p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re a fucking asshole,\u201d Stiles snaps, embarrassed as he grabs his CD. \u201cWhat are you even doing here?\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek points to Boyd, who is now walking with Erica towards the outside waiting area. \u201cHe wanted a wingman.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI thought you only used wingmen when you were trying to pick up chicks,\u201d Stiles says. \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure Boyd\u2019s already got Erica.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek shrugs. \u201cHe paid for my ticket, so free music.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Jennifer?\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek gives Stiles a scoffing laugh. \u201cShe said she wasn\u2019t setting foot in this disgusting place.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, that\u2019s too bad,\u201d Stiles says sarcastically, and Derek frowns.</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand why you don\u2019t like her. She\u2019s great when you get to know her.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll take your word for it.\u201d Derek\u2019s frown deepens, and Stiles says, \u201cI love this place. I\u2019ve been sneaking into shows since I was 15.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIf I recall, you dragged me along into some of those shows,\u201d Derek laughs. \u201cI will never forget the time we got caught and they called your dad.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOhmigod,\u201d Stiles groans, dropping his head onto the table. \u201cThat was awful. I was grounded for two weeks, and Peter didn\u2019t do <i>anything</i> to you. He just laughed and said he was proud.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s Peter for you.\u201d Derek\u2019s hand moves closer to Stiles\u2019 face, and he picks up the CD and studies it. \u201cNew music for my CDs?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d Stiles grins from where his head\u2019s still resting on the table. Derek grins back, and they kinda stay like that for a moment, just looking at each other and staring until Isaac clears his throat. Stiles shoots up and almost falls off his stool. He\u2019d forgotten Isaac was even sitting there. \u201cDerek, you remember Isaac,\u201d Stiles says quickly, looking between the two of them. Isaac\u2019s giving him a knowing look, and Stiles flicks him off.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey Derek, nice to see you again,\u201d Isaac says. \u201cGlad you could join us. Stiles talks about you all the time.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe does?\u201d Derek asks, looking at Stiles with a confused smile.</p>\n<p>Stiles feels his cheeks heat, and he shakes his head back and forth quickly. \u201cI most certainly do not. Nope. Not more than I talk about everyone else, I probably talk about Scott the most, until the point that Isaac\u2019s sick of hearing about him.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, I think you talk about Derek more,\u201d Isaac says, just like the asshole he is.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s kinda awesome,\u201d Derek says good-naturedly. \u201cI hope it\u2019s all good, though. Don\u2019t want Stiles spreading vicious lies about me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh believe me, it\u2019s good,\u201d Isaac says, and Stiles really just wants to die right there on the spot.</p>\n<p>Stiles is thankfully saved by the house lights dimming, and he tries to nonchalantly kick Isaac under the table. He just ends up kicking the stool instead.</p>\n<p>The band is\u2026awful, is a nice way of putting it. After two songs, Stiles is pretty sure his ears are bleeding. Derek doesn\u2019t look like he feels any differently about the band, so Stiles leans over and yells, \u201cWanna get out of here?\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek nods gratefully, and Stiles grabs his skateboard, punches Isaac in the arm, and walks out of the bar. Outside, the night air is cool, but it\u2019s blissfully noise free.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat was horrid,\u201d Stiles says, fingers in both of his ears in an attempt to stop the ringing. </p>\n<p>Derek\u2019s on his phone, typing out a text. \u201cI\u2019m telling Boyd I\u2019ll be out here when he\u2019s ready. I gave him a ride.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCool.\u201d Stiles steps onto the deserted street and drops his skateboard. He rolls down a few feet, then jumps into an intricate trick.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to stick around,\u201d Derek says from where he\u2019s following behind him slowly. \u201cI can find somewhere to hang out until Boyd\u2019s done.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s no problem,\u201d Stiles says. \u201cWe haven\u2019t hung out in awhile. Are you hungry? We can go grab some food or something.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, that sounds cool.\u201d </p>\n<p>Stiles slows until he rolling beside Derek as they turn the corner and go a block to the late night hamburger joint. They go inside, and Stiles glances at the huge burger brought to the table nearby. \u201cDude, I\u2019m not <i>that</i> hungry.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe can share,\u201d Derek replies easily. </p>\n<p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy not? I\u2019ve already had dinner; I don\u2019t need a huge burger on top of that.\u201d</p>\n<p>They order a bacon cheeseburger and a large order of fries. Stiles feels a bit indulgent even as he glances at his half of burger. \u201cThis is bigger than my head.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that big,\u201d Derek says, taking a bite, seemingly unaffected by the monstrosity before them. \u201cI\u2019ve seen bigger.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles is about to reply when he sees the corner of Derek\u2019s eyes crinkle, and then he tosses a sugar packet at his head. \u201cYou\u2019re such a jerk. I\u2019ve seen bigger. Such a dork.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek\u2019s laughing, and Stiles tries to resist, but Derek\u2019s laugh is infectious. \u201cThis is the best burger I\u2019ve ever tasted.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles swallows and nods his head. \u201cI definitely agree. These fries are pretty fantastic, too.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek grabs a handful and shoves them into his mouth, ends of the fries just sticking out of his mouth. \u201cThey\u2019re great,\u201d Derek mumbles through his food.</p>\n<p>\u201cCharming. I can see why you\u2019re so popular,\u201d Stiles jokes, and Derek finishes eating and swallows. </p>\n<p>\u201cThat bothers you, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d Derek asks. \u201cThat I\u2019m popular and you\u2019re not.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo.\u201d Derek raises an eyebrow, and Stiles sighs. \u201cIt\u2019s not that I care you\u2019re popular,\u201d he begins. \u201cLike, I\u2019m totally happy for your high school success. I\u2019m not even that sad I\u2019m not popular, if truth be told. Like I told you the other night, I\u2019m happy. It\u2019s just\u2026\u201d Stiles chews on his lip as he pushes fries around on the plate between them. \u201cThe people you hang out with aren\u2019t very nice, you know? I mean, they basically hate my guts. And sometimes, I just\u2026I\u2019m sad that we don\u2019t hang out more,\u201d Stiles admits, lifting his eyes and meeting Derek\u2019s. </p>\n<p>\u201cI miss you, too,\u201d Derek says sincerely, and Stiles feels his heart skip. \u201cIt\u2019s just, you have your friends and I have my friends. I like McCall and stuff, but,\u201d Derek shrugs. \u201cHigh school kinda blows, you know?\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles snorts. \u201cPreaching to the choir, dude.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI know my friends are assholes,\u201d Derek concedes. \u201cBoyd\u2019s great \u2013 \u201c</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, totally dig Boyd,\u201d Stiles agrees, nodding his head.</p>\n<p>\u201cBut like Ennis, Aiden, Jackson? I know they\u2019re jerks. But,\u201d Derek shrugs. \u201cWhat can I do? I\u2019ve told them to leave you and McCall alone, which they\u2019ve mostly listened to.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThanks,\u201d Stiles bites out. It\u2019s not directed towards Derek, it just kinda stings to know Derek had to take up for him. </p>\n<p>\u201cEven Jennifer is\u2026\u201d Derek hesitates, choosing his words carefully. \u201cShe\u2019s great, she really is,\u201d he finally says, and when Stiles makes a face, Derek rolls his eyes. \u201cI know you don\u2019t see it, but she really is a wonderful girl. And fun, and beautiful, and smart. I know she can be catty, but\u2026it\u2019s high school, right?\u201d Derek shrugs, and idly swirls his straw in his milkshake. \u201cWe\u2019ve been fighting more,\u201d he states quietly. \u201cNo one really knows, except Boyd and Kali, but\u2026I don\u2019t know. She says I don\u2019t pay enough attention to her, that I\u2019m way too obsessed with baseball, that we can\u2019t go five minutes without me talking about baseball or something. And I\u2019ve had to cancel dates with her because my grades are slipping because I\u2019ve been focusing so much on baseball, but Stiles, it\u2019s like, my life. There\u2019s nothing I love more in this world than baseball, and Coach thinks I can go pro, and if I get these scholarships\u2026\u201d Derek looks up at Stiles, and there\u2019s pain and frustration written across his face. \u201cIt\u2019s my life, Stiles. I might actually make this happen, and she doesn\u2019t even seem to care.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles has to bite his tongue. There are so many things he <i>wants</i> to say. But the look on Derek\u2019s face stops him. Derek deserves so much more than this.</p>\n<p>\u201cI care,\u201d Stiles says lamely, his voice barely a whisper. \u201cI know how much this means to you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek watches him a moment, then says, \u201cI know you do.\u201d</p>\n<p>They eat in silence for a few minutes, and then because Stiles can\u2019t stand silence he says, \u201cI\u2019m sorry that you\u2019re fighting with Jennifer.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI thought you didn\u2019t like her.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI dislike you being unhappy more,\u201d Stiles replies simply. The look on Derek\u2019s face is unreadable, but before Stiles can try to figure it out, it\u2019s gone and Derek is slurping the rest of his milkshake.</p>\n<p>When the waitress brings the check, Stiles reaches into his pants pocket to dig out his money, but Derek snatches the bill and pulls out a debit card. \u201cMy treat.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDude, seriously, I can pay for my half,\u201d Stiles says, slapping a wad of cash on the table. </p>\n<p>Derek frowns. \u201cKeep your money. Peter just puts money into our accounts, so I have plenty. I know you make shit at that job. The only reason Laura kept working there was because she liked being around the music all day.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d Stiles asks.</p>\n<p>Derek waves him off, climbs out of the booth, and goes to the register to pay. Stiles feels something warm spreading through his chest. There\u2019s something comforting about the ease with which they fall back into their usual routine, the easy way they walk down the street together, talking of nothing. But it makes Stiles yearn for things he can never have, so he shoves all that deep down inside and enjoys the sound of making Derek laugh.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou should give it a go,\u201d Stiles says as they hang around on the side street near the bar. He slides the skateboard over to Derek with his foot. \u201cYou used to be pretty good.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI haven\u2019t been on a skateboard in like two years.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cChicken.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cYou did not just call me chicken.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, I think I did.\u201d Stiles smirks and crosses his arms over his chest. \u201cToo good for skateboards, I see how it is. Or maybe you\u2019re just afraid of falling on your ass.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSuch a dick,\u201d Derek mutters as he gets on the skateboard. He\u2019s a little unsteady on his feet, but he pushes off and rolls past Stiles. He smirks and then flicks Stiles off\u2026which upsets his balance. Derek\u2019s arms windmill around, and Stiles watches as the skateboard shoots one way and Derek falls backward.</p>\n<p>\u201cDerek!\u201d Stiles yells, running over to where Derek\u2019s splayed on his back on the pavement, and drops to his knees. \u201cDerek! Can you hear me? Oh god, I\u2019ve killed you. You\u2019re dead. Derek!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI fell,\u201d Derek groans, \u201cI didn\u2019t break my ears. I\u2019m not fucking deaf.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you hurt?\u201d Stiles asks, his hands hovering back and forth over Derek\u2019s body, unsure what to do. \u201cIf you\u2019ve like broken your back, I\u2019m pretty sure you\u2019re not supposed to move \u2013 OH GOD, YOU\u2019RE MOVING!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cStill not deaf,\u201d Derek says as he pushes himself into a sitting position. He rubs his shoulder and then his butt gingerly. \u201cFuck you. This is your fault.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHow is this my fault?\u201d Stiles exclaims. \u201cYou\u2019re the idiot who fell!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m such an idiot,\u201d Derek grunts as he pushes himself to his feet. \u201cIf I\u2019d broken anything, I wouldn\u2019t be able to play in the championship.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFuck,\u201d Stiles exclaims, jumping to his feet. \u201cI\u2019m such a fucking unsupportive, insensitive idiot!\u201d He stalks over to his skateboard. \u201cLeave it up to me to ruin your chances at achieving your fucking dream with something as idiotic and juvenile as a skateboard accident.\u201d Stiles yanks the skateboard off the ground, rights it, and starts rolling away.</p>\n<p>\u201cStiles, wait!\u201d he hears from behind him, but he\u2019s just <i>angry</i> at himself because he was supposed to think about this, he was supposed to be the one who always supported Derek. It\u2019d been that way since he\u2019d moved in next door to him. \u201cStiles!\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek runs up beside him, and then runs up ahead. He spins around and starts jogging backwards. \u201cStop.\u201d Stiles complies, but looks at the cracked asphalt instead of Derek. \u201cWhy are you upset?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBetter question is why aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy would I be upset?\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cBecause I almost ruined your chances.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cStiles, look at me.\u201d He refuses, and Derek grabs his arm. \u201cHey, seriously, look at me.\u201d Stiles lifts his eyes and Derek\u2019s looking at him, and he\u2019s miraculously not angry. \u201cI\u2019m fine. It wasn\u2019t even that big of a deal, and I got on the skateboard fully aware of the risks. It\u2019s not your fault.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles frowns. \u201cIf you would\u2019ve \u2013 \u201c</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, but I didn\u2019t,\u201d Derek says. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to roll away, unless you want to.\u201d Derek pauses and shuffles his feet awkwardly. \u201cI\u2019m actually having fun, and I\u2019d like it if you continued to hang around until Boyd comes out.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cReally? You\u2019re not tired of me yet?\u201d Stiles asks.</p>\n<p>\u201cI never get tired of you.\u201d Derek smiles, and Stiles finds himself grinning despite the worry he feels.</p>\n<p>Stiles rolls back to their previous spot, and idly does tricks as he and Derek talk. \u201cHow\u2019s your back?\u201d Stiles asks after awhile.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine. I\u2019m more embarrassed than anything. The only thing that\u2019s bruised is my ego.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles snorts and jumps off his skateboard and drops onto the low concrete wall beside Derek. \u201cI think you could use a bruised ego once in awhile.\u201d Derek shoves him.</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you cold?\u201d Derek asks when Stiles shivers. He\u2019s playing Candy Crush on his phone, and now that he\u2019s sitting here instead of riding his board, the cold night is starting to get to him. He shrugs. </p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that bad.\u201d But his answer is accompanied by another shiver.</p>\n<p>\u201cHere,\u201d Derek says, shrugging out of his Letterman jacket and handing it to Stiles. </p>\n<p>Stiles looks at it, mouth agape. \u201cNo,\u201d he finally says. \u201cSeriously, it\u2019s fine.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek rolls his eyes and pushes the jacket into Stiles\u2019 hands. \u201cTake it. You\u2019re shivering; there are goose pimples all over your arms.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut won\u2019t you get cold?\u201d Stiles asks stupidly. Derek shakes his head, and presses the jacket against Stiles again. Stiles can only resist so long. He takes the jacket and pulls it on. It\u2019s still filled with the warmth from Derek\u2019s body, and this time Stiles shivers from the shock of it against his cold skin. </p>\n<p>\u201cSee? Knew you were cold,\u201d Derek says. Stiles wraps the jacket closer around him, discreetly lowers his chin to his chest and closes his eyes as he inhales. It smells like Derek\u2019s cologne.</p>\n<p>\u201cThanks,\u201d Stiles says quietly.</p>\n<p>\u201cWelcome.\u201d</p>\n<p>No matter what else happens, Stiles thinks, tonight was a good night.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Stiles rides with Derek when he gives Boyd a lift home after Boyd and Erica finally exit the club. Stiles gets home after midnight on a Friday night, because he spent all night with Derek. He feels almost cool.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s not until he\u2019s upstairs in his room and has kicked off his shoes that he realizes he\u2019s still wearing Derek\u2019s jacket. Stiles glances over at Derek\u2019s window, but it\u2019s dark.</p>\n<p>So, Stiles curls up in Derek\u2019s jacket, and falls asleep warm and content.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy do you have a Letterman jacket?\u201d Scott asks Stiles Monday morning at school. Stiles was going to give it back to Derek all weekend, but Derek was gone all Saturday, and Sunday Stiles hung out with his dad and worked on homework and didn\u2019t really think about it until he saw it hanging on the back of his desk chair Sunday night. Derek obviously didn\u2019t miss it, since he didn\u2019t make an effort to retrieve it over the weekend. Stiles just decided to give it to Derek at school on Monday.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s Derek\u2019s,\u201d Stiles explains as he shoves it in his locker and retrieves his physics book.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy do you have Derek\u2019s jacket?\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cHe lent it to me on Friday night because I was cold.\u201d Scott stops and just looks at Stiles. \u201cWhat?\u201d Stiles asks.</p>\n<p>\u201cIsn\u2019t that a little weird?\u201d Scott asks. </p>\n<p>\u201cHow is it weird?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe let you wear his jacket.\u201d Stiles just shakes his head in incomprehension. \u201cDude, the only person I\u2019ve ever let wear my jacket is Allison,\u201d Scott points out.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve worn it!\u201d Stiles exclaims.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou don\u2019t count.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p>\n<p>Scott huffs. \u201cYou know what I mean. You\u2019re like my brother, so it\u2019s not weird if you wear my jacket. And it was only that one time when you forgot your hoodie and we were at the lake with your dad. It wasn\u2019t on a Friday night, and you didn\u2019t keep it all weekend.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles slams his locker shut. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s weird.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cScott, just\u2026drop it,\u201d Stiles sighs. The last thing he needs is Scott implying things that he doesn\u2019t want to think about.</p>\n<p>Stiles tries to find a good time all day to give Derek back his jacket, but Stiles\u2019 path never crosses Derek\u2019s on a typical school day. So the jacket sits shoved in Stiles\u2019 locker all day.</p>\n<p>After school, Stiles knows that Derek usually hangs out with Jennifer and some of the baseball team and their girlfriends before heading off to practice. Stiles has gone with Scott to practice enough to know that most afternoons, the popular senior crowd congregates at the end of the English hall. So, he doesn\u2019t think anything about it when he takes the jacket down there.</p>\n<p>Derek\u2019s back is to Stiles, his arm slung across Jennifer\u2019s shoulders. Boyd, Ennis, Kali, and Aiden are all standing around him. Ennis sees him first.</p>\n<p>\u201cI think you got lost, loser.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHow original,\u201d Stiles drawls, rolling his eyes. \u201cBet it took you all day to think of that insult, didn\u2019t it? Been saving it for awhile?\u201d</p>\n<p>Ennis glares at him and starts to step forward, but Kali puts a hand on his arm. Derek and Jennifer turn around then; Derek grins at Stiles, even though he looks confused to see him, and Jennifer looks at him like he\u2019s an unpleasant bug that smells. Stiles took a shower that morning; he knows he doesn\u2019t smell.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d Derek asks.</p>\n<p>\u201cStan, how nice to see you,\u201d Jennifer says all saccharine and fake smiles.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s Stiles, actually, though I can see how you could get confused. Stiles is so hard to remember.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jennifer narrows her eyes, and Derek heaves an aggrieved sigh. \u201cStiles,\u201d he says in the tone Stiles has come to understand as his \u201cStiles-is-being-difficult-why-do-I-talk-to-him-again?\u201d voice.</p>\n<p>\u201cHere,\u201d Stiles says, awkwardly handing Derek his jacket. This had seemed like such an easy thing to do: find Derek, return jacket, leave school. But this is just weird and maybe he should have taken it over and left it with Peter, because being alone with creepy Peter in a kimono is much less awkward than this.</p>\n<p>\u201cIs that your <i>jacket</i>?\u201d Jennifer exclaims. \u201cWhat is he doing with your jacket?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI leant it to him Friday night. I forgot.\u201d Derek smiles. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles returns the smile. \u201cNo problem.\u201d He turns to go, but he\u2019s stopped by someone much stronger than him, and then he\u2019s being pushed back into the locker. Hard. Pain shoots through his shoulder, but it doesn\u2019t sting as much as his ego.</p>\n<p>Ennis\u2019 face is looming above his, and he\u2019s staring down at Stiles menacingly. \u201cWhere you going, <i>Sti-les?</i> he asks, drawing out Stiles\u2019 name until it\u2019s two syllables. </p>\n<p>\u201cEnnis,\u201d Derek warns, voice low and deep.</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Hale, we\u2019re just having a little chat with your friend. Ain\u2019t that right, <i>Stiles?</i>\u201d Ennis pins Stiles against the locker with a firm grip, and no matter how much he squirms, he gets nowhere. \u201cJust getting to know your pal here, Hale. You\u2019re like Mahealani, aren\u2019t you, Stalonzy?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cStilinski,\u201d Stiles mutters, his heart pounding in his chest. He\u2019s kind of scared, and majorly embarrassed. And a tiny (huge) part of him is hurt that Derek\u2019s just <i>standing there</i>.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, it\u2019s funny that you think I care what your name actually is.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cEnnis, seriously, chill the fuck out,\u201d Derek says.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou think Derek\u2019s gonna keep you safe, don\u2019t you? See,\u201d Ennis leans closer and lowers his voice, \u201cYou\u2019re just a waste of fucking space at this school. Just sharing the hallway with you right now makes me sick.\u201d Ennis spits, a wad of mucus landing on Stiles\u2019 jaw, and Stiles jerks at the impact. He feels the slime slide down his skin, revulsion and humiliation churning in his belly.</p>\n<p>Then Ennis is gone. Stiles watches as Derek puts himself between the two of them. \u201cWhat the fuck is your fucking problem?\u201d Derek yells, shoving Ennis. \u201cAre you insane?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cJust because you have some hard on for the nerd doesn\u2019t mean the rest of us do.\u201d Ennis shoves Derek back, and Jennifer and Kali start talking in fast, high-pitched squeals, trying to calm the boys. Stiles just stands frozen on spot, watching the scene as a huge lugy clings to his chin.</p>\n<p>A hand circles his arm, and he recoils. But it\u2019s just Boyd, leading him away from the group. He hands Stiles a napkin from his backpack. </p>\n<p>\u201cThanks,\u201d Stiles says, wiping his face and feeling all around disgusting. Boyd nods, and there\u2019s a deep frown on his face when he turns back to the group.</p>\n<p>Stiles takes what little dignity he has left and walks away. There are so many emotions rumbling violently inside of him, and he tries to keep himself in check. He\u2019s not sure if tears or flying fists will come out.</p>\n<p>\u201cStiles!\u201d </p>\n<p>Stiles doesn\u2019t stop. The only thing he can do right now is keep walking forward, away from everything \u2013 and everyone \u2013 behind him.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey,\u201d Derek says, falling into step beside Stiles. \u201cI\u2019m sorry about \u2013 \u201c</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d Stiles bites out.</p>\n<p>\u201cBut I \u2013 \u201c</p>\n<p>Stiles whips around and glares at Derek. Everything he was trying to hold back, all those violent emotions just explode inside of him. \u201cDon\u2019t you <i>dare</i> apologize or defend that piece of shit,\u201d Stiles seethes. \u201cI never thought \u2013 you were supposed to \u2013 just, no.\u201d He shakes his head, tears gathering in his eyes from embarrassment, anger, and bitter bitter disappointment. \u201cYou were supposed to be my friend.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek\u2019s face falls, and there is genuine pain and frustration on it, but it\u2019s not enough. Not this time. \u201cStiles, I \u2013 \u201c</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d Stiles turns and says, \u201cDon\u2019t waste your breath on a waste of space like me.\u201d</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Stiles usually spends Monday afternoons watching baseball practice with Lydia, but after what just happened, that <i>totally</i> wasn\u2019t happening. Instead, he\u2019s huddled beneath the bleachers beside the lacrosse field with his bookbag and skateboard, hiding from the world.</p>\n<p>His eyes had been damp for a few minutes, but then Stiles realized that some jock asshole like Ennis didn\u2019t deserve his tears. However, he knew Derek was actually the cause, not Ennis. </p>\n<p>He didn\u2019t know what he expected really. Sure, he and Derek had hung out Friday night, but Stiles knew that Ennis, Jennifer, and the rest were his <i>friends</i>. Stiles was just making something out of nothing.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s picking at the grass and rolling his skateboard back and forth with his foot when someone ducks under the bleachers. It\u2019s Scott, followed by Allison, Lydia, Kira, and Cora.</p>\n<p>\u201cDude, what are you doing under here?\u201d Scott asks, dropping onto the grass beside Stiles in an unceremonious heap of limbs. </p>\n<p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Stiles asks, looking around at everyone. \u201cHow did you find me?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt was Cora,\u201d Kira says, smiling proudly at her. \u201cAfter Derek broke a wooden bat and then threw an aluminum one across the field, Cora figured something was probably wrong.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDestruction of property was my first clue,\u201d Cora drawls. \u201cThen there was your conspicuous absence.\u201d She smirks slightly. \u201cThough, Derek constantly looking into the bleachers with a scowl was another big fucking clue.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGo away,\u201d Stiles says, crossing his arms over his chest.</p>\n<p>\u201cStiles, I am <i>under bleachers</i>,\u201d Lydia says, sitting on Kira\u2019s cardigan like she\u2019s afraid the grass will burn her if it touches her. \u201cThis is disgusting, and this dress cost more than your Jeep, so stop with the asshole act, and tell us what\u2019s wrong.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles deflects the question by turning to Scott. \u201cAren\u2019t you supposed to be at practice?\u201d</p>\n<p>Scott shrugs. \u201cI blew it off.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut\u2026the championship.\u201d</p>\n<p>Scott looks hurt at the idea that something like a baseball championship could possibly be more important than Stiles. It makes Stiles smile, despite the afternoon\u2019s events. Actually, looking around at everyone sitting beneath the bleachers, Scott and Allison beside him, Cora and Kira sitting together off to the side, and Lydia sitting primly on the cardigan, he feels a bit of the knot in his chest loosen.</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t care about the championship,\u201d Scott says. \u201cI mean, I do, but the seniors are going to have the most play time, so no one is going to care about me.\u201d He grins, and Stiles thinks Scott definitely gets the award for Best Best Friend Ever.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo, what did my brother do?\u201d Cora huffs, looking somewhere between bored and pissed off. Which, Stiles admits, is Cora\u2019s default mode.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy do you assume this has anything to do with Derek?\u201d Stiles asks.</p>\n<p>\u201cUm, did you miss the part where he broke a bat?\u201d Cora says, dropping her chin and looking at Stiles like he\u2019s a Grade-A idiot.</p>\n<p>\u201cStiles honey, there\u2019s only one person in this world who can make you crawl under the bleachers,\u201d Lydia says, \u201cand that person is Derek Hale.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles feels his cheeks burn, and he looks away, out past the bleachers to the field. \u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re talking about your massive crush on Derek,\u201d Kira says. Everyone looks at her sharply. Her shoulders hunch, and she says, \u201cWas it supposed to be a secret? Cause, like, I figured if I knew about it then it was common knowledge.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles groans as he hits his head against the bleacher behind him again and again. \u201cThis is horrible. Today was hands down the worst day of my high school career. Ennis spit on me. <i>He fucking spit on me.</i> In the middle of the hall. With Derek, Jennifer, and Kali <i>right there</i>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI hate that guy,\u201d Scott grumbles. </p>\n<p>\u201cWhat did Derek do?\u201d Cora asks, fuming. </p>\n<p>\u201cHe stepped in and shoved Ennis, but\u2026 \u201c Stiles shakes his head. \u201cWhat did I expect him to do? Ennis is his friend.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFucking Derek,\u201d Cora mutters as she gets up and bolts from underneath the bleachers.</p>\n<p>\u201cCora!\u201d Stiles yells. \u201cShit.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll go get her,\u201d Kira says, giving Stiles an encouraging smile before running after Cora. Stiles just leans against the warm metal and sighs. </p>\n<p>\u201cForget them,\u201d Lydia states simply.</p>\n<p>\u201cEasy for you to say,\u201d Stiles replies. \u201cYou don\u2019t have dried spit on your face.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lydia grabs her bag and starts rummaging through it. \u201cAfter I win prom queen, none of this will matter. I will take you to prom myself, Jackson be damned, if I have to,\u201d she says. Stiles kinda balks at her as she finds whatever she\u2019s looking for in her purse. \u201cA-ha!\u201d Lydia pulls out a package of makeup remover towelettes. \u201cHere, wash your face.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThanks.\u201d Stiles starts scrubbing his face as Scott stares angrily at Stiles\u2019 chin. </p>\n<p>\u201cDerek is a jerk,\u201d Scott says. \u201cHe shouldn\u2019t even be friends with that asshole in the first place.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles frowns. \u201cAt least he stepped in.\u201d He sighs. \u201cStill doesn\u2019t make me feel any better.\u201d</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Stiles ignores the five texts Derek sends that evening. He tries not to glance at the window every five minutes, but it\u2019s hard. Once when he looks over, he sees Derek and Cora standing in his bedroom, arguing. From the way Cora left the bleachers earlier, Stiles is almost positive it\u2019s because of him. Something about that gives him a twisted sort of satisfaction.</p>\n<p>At lunch the next day, Stiles is talking to Allison, Scott, and Kira when someone takes the seat on the other side of Kira. Stiles does a double take when he sees who it is: Boyd.</p>\n<p>\u201cTell Derek I\u2019m not accepting messages via his best friend, but nice try,\u201d Stiles says, rolling his eyes. </p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not here for Derek,\u201d Boyd says, pulling a brown paper lunch sack from his backpack on the floor. Stiles waits, but Boyd doesn\u2019t say anything, just pulls out a PB&amp;J sandwich.</p>\n<p>\u201cThen why are you sitting here?\u201d Stiles asks, and Allison elbows him roughly in the side. He grunts, and adds, \u201cNot that we\u2019re not just thrilled to have you join us, and obviously we have the room, but\u2026\u201d Stiles twists in his seat to look over his shoulder, towards the center of the cafeteria where the popular people sit. He easily finds Derek and Jennifer, and Jackson and Lydia at the neighboring table. Boyd\u2019s usual seat beside Derek was vacant.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019d rather sit here,\u201d Boyd says. He crunches on a handful of chips, and gives Stiles a close-lipped smile.</p>\n<p>Stiles isn\u2019t sure what to think about Boyd switching lunch tables, but he likes Boyd so he doesn\u2019t mind the company. Sometime during lunch, Stiles turns around and looks at Derek\u2019s table again, and finds Derek looking at him. Their gazes hold for longer than they should, until Stiles finally tears his eyes away.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>\u201cThis is angrier than what you usually listen to,\u201d Erica says when she comes into the record shop, wearing a tight t-shirt, cut offs, and high topped sneakers. The pop of gum just finishes the look. \u201cUsually it\u2019s some pretentious hipster bullshit you got from some jerkoff blog.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s ironic,\u201d Stiles retorts. Erica flips him off as she comes behind the counter. </p>\n<p>\u201cSo, sunshine, what\u2019s wrong today?\u201d She leans her elbows on the counter, and Stiles gets distracted by her boobs resting on her arms. Erica\u2019s just amused.</p>\n<p>\u201cNothing,\u201d Stiles finally says. </p>\n<p>\u201cLiar. Angry punk isn\u2019t your style, so it\u2019s some kind of high school angst-induced mood swing. Spill it, Stilinski. I\u2019m here to listen, and despite popular opinion, I\u2019m pretty good at that kind of stuff.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI bet you are,\u201d Stiles jokes, and Erica waggles her eyebrows. Stiles smiles despite himself, and rolls his eyes and says, \u201cIt\u2019s just some stupid shit. Bullies, crushes, stuff like that, you know?\u201d</p>\n<p>To Stiles\u2019 surprise, Erica slings her arm around his shoulders, and suddenly Isaac is on his other side, and Stiles is pressed between them. She drops a kiss on Stiles\u2019 cheek. \u201cLook, first off, high school is stupid. Social hierarchies are fucking stupid, and anyone who adheres to them, or gets upset by them, are stupid.\u201d She shoots him a baleful glance. \u201cYes, I\u2019m talking about you right now.\u201d She blows another bubble with her gum, and Stiles reaches forward to pop it. \u201cSecond, you are hot, in that nerd-geek sort of way. I\u2019d totally do you, and so would Isaac.\u201d Stiles\u2019 mouth drops open as he looks from her to Isaac on his other side, and Isaac nods in confirmation. \u201cAnd I know we\u2019re both hot, so if some stupid high school prick doesn\u2019t think your ass is totally worth tapping? He\u2019s not worth your fucking time.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles just stares back and forth between them, totally thrown. \u201cThat is oddly sweet,\u201d he finally says.</p>\n<p>\u201cStop being such a moper,\u201d Erica says. \u201cCause as much as I like The Runaways, you\u2019re totally bringing me down.\u201d </p>\n<p>Erica pops a bubble loudly in his face before going over to the record player and switching it for something with an electronic beat that she can dance around to as she sweeps. Stiles just watches her, shaking his head.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey,\u201d Isaac says from beside him, and honestly, Stiles had forgotten that Isaac was still there. \u201cIt\u2019s true you know.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat is?\u201d Stiles asks dumbly. </p>\n<p>Isaac heaves a sigh and rolls his eyes. \u201cIf you ever realize Derek Hale isn\u2019t the only guy in the world, give me a call.\u201d Isaac gives Stiles a smirk, and then he disappears into the back.</p>\n<p>And well, that was just not what Stiles had expected.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Friday night is Dad night since his dad has a rare evening off. His dad has just come home from his shift and is in the shower, and Stiles is working on some homework so he doesn\u2019t have to worry about it the rest of the weekend when he hears something hit his window. He flails about in surprise and glances over to see Derek standing at his window, holding his whiteboard.</p>\n<p>Stiles frowns as he walks to the window. In Derek\u2019s large scrawl he reads, <i>TALK TO ME.</i></p>\n<p>Stiles yanks his board from under the window and writes, <i>Nothing to talk about.</i> He flips it around and tries to look neutral. </p>\n<p>Derek\u2019s eyebrows draw together and he wipes his words away with his forearm before writing again. <i>You\u2019re mad at me. We need to talk. Please?</i></p>\n<p>\n<i> Nothing to be mad about. You don\u2019t owe me anything.</i>\n</p>\n<p>Derek\u2019s eyebrows are almost a unibrow as he reads Stiles\u2019 words, and when Derek goes to write another message, Stiles drops the whiteboard to the floor and goes downstairs. </p>\n<p>Stiles is in the kitchen, chopping tomatoes for his awesome homemade, heart-healthy fajitas when he hears the doorbell ring. Stiles wipes tomato juice on his khakis and heads through the house. When he pulls the door open, he\u2019s surprised to see Derek on the other side.</p>\n<p>\u201cBefore you slam the door in my face,\u201d Derek says, putting his hand on the door to keep Stiles from slamming it in his face, \u201cI know you\u2019re mad, so don\u2019t deny it, but Peter\u2019s being a total creeper, wearing his kimono around again, burning incense, and the food he\u2019s set out on the table is all raw, and I\u2019m not talking sushi or a rare steak. And there\u2019s this woman at the house, and I just don\u2019t want to know.\u201d Derek uncomfortably shifts from foot to foot, and Stiles sighs because he can\u2019t just <i>refuse</i> to let Derek in his house to get away from Uncle Creepy, so he steps aside to let Derek in. </p>\n<p>After Stiles closes the door, Derek gives him a small smile. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhatever,\u201d Stiles says. It\u2019s not like it\u2019s the first time Derek has come to his house to hide from creepy Peter. That first summer, Derek hid out at Stiles\u2019 house multiple times a week. It was one of the reasons they became such good friends. But it\u2019d been awhile since Derek had chosen Stiles\u2019 place to hide out in. Knowing he\u2019s being immature, he says sarcastically, \u201cThough, being Friday night, I thought you\u2019d be with Jennifer or one of your friends.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAh, yeah,\u201d Derek says as he follows Stiles into the kitchen. \u201cWell, see, Jen isn\u2019t exactly happy with me right now.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy\u2019s that?\u201d Stiles asks, going back to his fajitas as Derek takes a stool. He hands Derek an onion to start chopping. Hey, he can be petty if he wants, right?</p>\n<p>\u201cStiles,\u201d Derek starts, \u201cI owe you an apology.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles sighs and leans back against the counter, facing Derek. \u201cI owe you one, too.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek\u2019s brows draw together in confusion as he shakes his head. \u201cNo, you don\u2019t. What Ennis did \u2013 \u201c</p>\n<p>\u201cWas not your fault,\u201d Stiles interjects. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to save me from bullies. You\u2019re not my hero.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI should have broken his nose.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles huffs out a laugh. \u201cDid Cora talk to you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d Derek admits, \u201cBut I didn\u2019t need Cora to help me see that.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles runs a hand through his hair and starts looking through the spice rack. \u201cLook, I know that you\u2019re friends with those guys, and I know that you know they\u2019re jerks. And I know it\u2019s just high school bullshit, and it\u2019s not like we\u2019re really friends anymore, so I can\u2019t expect you to protect me \u2013 \u201c</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s not true,\u201d Derek says. \u201cWe are friends.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNot really, Derek,\u201d Stiles says sadly. \u201cWe were best friends a couple of years ago, for one summer. And that\u2019s cool, you know? I have Scott, and you have Boyd and the baseball team, and that\u2019s just the way it is. Doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re not still acquaintances or anything.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek looks troubled by all of this. His eyebrows are almost connected. \u201cIt shouldn\u2019t be like this, though. And I shouldn\u2019t have let Ennis walk out of school for treating you how he did.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt is what it is, man,\u201d Stiles replies. They look at each for a few moments, until Stiles nods and says, \u201cSo, are we done with stupid feelings shit now?\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek looks visibly distraught. \u201cAre we friends?\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles shrugs. \u201cYeah, nothing\u2019s changed.\u201d Stiles means it in all senses of the word; he knows that just because Derek is over here doesn\u2019t mean that they\u2019ve overturned the social hierarchy or anything. But Stiles just can\u2019t be mad at Derek for long.</p>\n<p>When the sheriff comes down, he looks surprised to find Derek next to Stiles, pulling tortilla shells from the steamer. He smiles as he crosses the kitchen and claps Derek on the shoulder. \u201cHey, Derek. Long time no see. How are you doing?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, sir,\u201d Derek answers, waving his burning fingertips around.</p>\n<p>\u201cHow\u2019s your family?\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cThey\u2019re good.\u201d</p>\n<p>The sheriff nods, and Stiles points to a stack of plates. \u201cDad, can you help set the table?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo problem, kiddo.\u201d </p>\n<p>The sheriff sets the table with the food Stiles and Derek had already prepared in bowls, and Stiles finishes saut\u00e9ing the peppers and onions while Derek takes the tortillas and meat to the table. When they\u2019re all seated, the sheriff surveys the food appreciatively.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis looks good, Stiles.\u201d He stares at the steak in the bowl he\u2019s holding suspiciously. \u201cAnd you swear it\u2019s good for me?\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles nods. \u201cYep. Healthy, but delicious.\u201d Stiles glances at Derek. \u201cHe thinks that healthy eating means no taste. I keep telling him that\u2019s what the internet\u2019s for, tasty delicious recipes that will keep his heart from like imploding in his chest.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek laughs and the sheriff frowns. \u201cI don\u2019t understand half of what comes out of his mouth when he starts rambling about hydrogenated oils and good carbs and whatever else.\u201d The sheriff scoops beans onto the tortilla. \u201cI don\u2019t know what I\u2019m going to do when he goes to college.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDa-ad,\u201d Stiles mutters, feeling his cheeks heat. \u201cStop embarrassing me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s just Derek,\u201d the sheriff says, like it was just yesterday that Derek was over everyday raiding their refrigerator. </p>\n<p>\u201cAt least it\u2019s all cooked,\u201d Derek says. \u201cBetter than my house.\u201d Derek shudders, and Stiles laughs.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo,\u201d the sheriff says halfway through the meal, \u201cStiles tells me that you\u2019ve been talking to a few recruiters.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe did?\u201d Derek looks over at Stiles like that thought pleases him greatly before turning back to the sheriff. \u201cIt\u2019s true. A few colleges out east and in the Midwest, a few here. I really want to go to UC Irvine, so I can stay close.\u201d</p>\n<p>The sheriff nods his head. \u201cMakes sense. I wish Stiles would contemplate staying a little closer to home.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDad, we\u2019re not going through this again,\u201d Stiles says. \u201cI am going to apply everywhere, including California. So don\u2019t get all upset yet. Save that for when I end up in New York.\u201d Stiles gives his dad a wide smile.</p>\n<p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know you wanted to go away for school,\u201d Derek says. \u201cIt\u2019d be so weird if you were across the country.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles shrugs. \u201cThought college might be a good time to do something different, live somewhere different for awhile.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019d kinda suck if you were so far away so I couldn\u2019t see you at least some weekends,\u201d Derek says. </p>\n<p>Stiles is surprised at Derek\u2019s words, and he doesn\u2019t miss the way his dad is looking between them, but he ignores it. He focuses on the fact that Derek would miss him.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>After dinner, Derek helps Stiles and the sheriff clean up the dishes, then they all sit on the couch and watch Sportscenter. Derek and his dad get into a long discussion about this year\u2019s baseball teams, and Stiles doesn\u2019t care unless it\u2019s his precious Mets, so he screws around on his phone while they talk. It feels comfortable, and Stiles is happy. He\u2019s glad that Derek showed up and forced them to make up, because Stiles knows he is too damn stubborn to have done something like that. He would have let Derek graduate and go off to college without talking to him again. Because Stiles is an idiot. </p>\n<p>When the sheriff goes to bed, Stiles and Derek stay on the couch and idly watch some comedian. </p>\n<p>\u201cThanks for letting me come over,\u201d Derek says after awhile. \u201cI know you were angry at me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat gave you that idea?\u201d Stiles jokes. </p>\n<p>Derek smiles, but then it quickly falls. \u201cJennifer\u2019s mad at me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, I basically told Ennis to go fuck himself. We haven\u2019t spoken since, and Jennifer\u2019s best friends with Kali, so\u2026\u201d Derek trails off and rubs his hands against his face. \u201cIt\u2019s all so fucking stupid, Stiles. How is this my life?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, look, my ruby slippers are too tight,\u201d Stiles says sarcastically.</p>\n<p>\u201cFuck you, Stiles.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDerek, seriously? You\u2019re popular, your girlfriend is hot, and you have everything going for you. Forget Ennis, and honestly, forget Jennifer if she\u2019s going to be like that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy is all this so complicated?\u201d He slumps back against the couch. \u201cWe\u2019re seniors; we\u2019re supposed to be having fun.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThen have fun.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI guess.\u201d Derek stands up and stretches, then yawns. \u201cI should get going.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThanks for letting me crash dinner,\u201d Derek says as Stiles walks him to the door. \u201cI appreciate it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDoor\u2019s always open, man,\u201d Stiles says as Derek steps onto the porch. </p>\n<p>Derek turns around and looks like he\u2019s about to say something, but instead, he just smiles and then jogs off the porch.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>The next morning, Stiles organizes CDs with Isaac. Isaac complains the whole time, but Stiles thinks it\u2019s fun. Call him a weirdo, but he thinks that patterns, putting things into their correct places, things like that, theraputic. </p>\n<p>Halfway through his shift, his phone buzzes. It\u2019s Derek.</p>\n<p>\n<i>Want to go to the park and help me practice?</i>\n</p>\n<p>Stiles tries to hide his smile as he taps out, <i>At work, but afterwards?</i></p>\n<p>\n<i>Meet you at the park. I\u2019ll bring your glove.</i>\n</p>\n<p>Stiles grins full on as he goes back to the hard rock section.</p>\n<p>\u201cLet me guess who you were texting,\u201d Isaac says from two rows over.</p>\n<p>\u201cShut up, you\u2019re just jelly you can\u2019t have this hot bod,\u201d Stiles retorts, running a hand down his torso.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, so jealous,\u201d Isaac rolls his eyes and throws a stuffed anime character at Stiles\u2019 head. That starts a full on war, and by the time Erica returns from the back fifteen minutes later, the store\u2019s floor is covered in plushies, calendars, and all sorts of other non-breakable merchandise.</p>\n<p>\u201cI am so not cleaning this up,\u201d Erica states. \u201cYou two just need to pop into the back room and jerk each other off and get it over with. This kindergarten crap is so lame.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles feels himself blushing as he starts to clean up his mess. Because the thing is, it\u2019s not like he hasn\u2019t thought about dating Isaac or Erica. They\u2019re both hot as hell, and Stiles likes them both a lot. And after Isaac had made that comment last time Stiles worked, Stiles definitely spent all night thinking about what it would be like dating him. Isaac is great, and hot, and funny, and had great taste in music (and scarves). But\u2026Isaac isn\u2019t Derek. And Stiles really wishes he could just let himself fall for someone as awesome as Isaac, but he just can\u2019t while Derek is around.</p>\n<p>But it doesn\u2019t make it any easier with Erica making suggestive comments around them. Because Stiles was still a seventeen year old boy, and his dick wasn\u2019t blind. It was just fucking stupid, apparently.</p>\n<p>After Stiles\u2019 shift, he drives straight to the park. He sees Derek\u2019s Camaro parked at the ball field furthest away from everywhere else, the one down in the hole at the back of the park near the trees. It was Derek\u2019s favorite place to practice. </p>\n<p>Stiles walks onto the field where Derek has a pitching machine set up. He stands to the side as it throws a pitch and Derek swings, the ball shooting into left field.</p>\n<p>\u201cNice.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s shit,\u201d Derek growls as he swings at the next pitch, sending it foul. Stiles watches as Derek hits the remaining balls, growing more and more frustrated with each subsequent ball until the last three are strikes.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re out!\u201d Stiles yells.</p>\n<p>Derek pulls off his helmet and glares at Stiles as he throws it onto the ground. \u201cThanks Captain Obvious.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWow, great comeback, really.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek grips the bat like he\u2019s really thinking about using Stiles\u2019 head for practice, but Stiles walks forward anyway. </p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re in a <i>foul</i> mood.\u201d</p>\n<p>It takes Derek a minute, but then he\u2019s groaning and rolling his eyes. \u201cYou\u2019re an idiot.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou love having me around. Why else would you beg me to help you practice on a Saturday?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI didn\u2019t beg.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou were pretty much on your knees, and \u2013 \u201c Stiles stops, because <i>ohmigod did he just say that?</i> And if Derek\u2019s pink cheeks and wide eyes are any indication, then yes, he totally did. \u201cNot that I meant, I mean, shit. Shutting up now.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek laughs quietly, and some of the tension and frustration leaves his body. Stiles counts that as a victory.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo, what do you need me to do?\u201d Stiles asks, bending down to grab Derek\u2019s old glove that he\u2019d claimed as his own back during that summer back before Derek had friends and Stiles was just a lonely kid. He slips it on. It\u2019s a little stiff, and Stiles flexes his fingers and pounds his fist against the palm a few times to loosen it. He\u2019s helped Derek practice off and on over the last few years, mostly during the off season on weekends or when both boys were bored during the summers. But Stiles hasn\u2019t put the glove on since early last summer, almost a year ago. It feels good to be wearing it again.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ll just do some pitching to warm up,\u201d Derek explains, fitting his own glove to his hand and grabbing one of the many baseballs littering the ground. \u201cThen you can help me with fielding.\u201d</p>\n<p>They toss the ball back and forth, Stiles definitely out of practice. He makes himself feel better by believing that having Derek chase after his badly aimed pitches is good practice.</p>\n<p>After about fifteen minutes of this, Stiles is panting, and Derek is barely winded despite constantly running after Stiles\u2019 wild pitches. \u201cYou need to exercise more,\u201d Derek says as he tosses the ball back to Stiles. </p>\n<p>\u201cI exercise,\u201d Stiles says. \u201cI skateboard all the time.\u201d He tosses the ball again, and then immediately moves his arm around to dispel some of the growing ache. \u201cBut apparently I don\u2019t use my arms enough, except for, you know, the obvious.\u201d Stiles makes a fist and mimes jerking off. Derek rolls his eyes and throws the ball with extra force so that it stings Stiles\u2019 hand when it connects. \u201cOuch!\u201d Stiles exclaims, pulling his hand from the glove and shaking it out. \u201cFine, no more masturbatory humor.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFocus,\u201d Derek barks out as he jogs over to the sidelines and pulls off his glove. He shoves it under his arm before grabbing the bat. He walks over to Stiles and holds it out for him.</p>\n<p>Stiles eyes the bat warily. \u201cWhat exactly am I supposed to do with that?\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek rolls his eyes again and shoves the bat against Stiles\u2019 chest. \u201cI\u2019m going to set up the pitching machine. Hit the balls so I can practice my fielding.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThis is a colossally bad idea,\u201d Stiles points out. \u201cI\u2019m not so sure how I feel about having balls flying at my face.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI figured you\u2019d be okay with it,\u201d Derek says as he starts jogging towards the pitching mound.</p>\n<p>It takes Stiles a moment, but then he\u2019s shouting, \u201cDerek Hale! Did you just make a gay joke to me?\u201d Derek turns around and grins, and Stiles bursts out laughing. \u201cAnd you criticized my jack off joke.\u201d Derek looks so relaxed and happy, his face alight with laughter, that Stiles has trouble breathing for a moment. He doesn\u2019t care what made Derek look like that; he should just look like that all the time. \u201cAss.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cReady?\u201d Derek calls. Stiles grips the bat in his hands, takes a deep breath, and nods. Derek hits a button on the machine and runs towards second base while refitting his glove.</p>\n<p>The moment the first ball shoots out of the machine, Stiles emits a high-pitched yelp and runs off to the side, out of the way of danger.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat the hell was that?\u201d Derek yells, laughing.</p>\n<p>\u201cI panicked!\u201d Stiles is breathing hard, his heart pounding at his near death experience. \u201cI know this face isn\u2019t as perfect as yours, but I\u2019d like to keep it in one piece. It\u2019s all I got, dude.\u201d Another ball pops out from the machine, and Stiles does a better job of hiding his scream. He\u2019s pretty sure that one was going ten times faster and straight for him. \u201cAre you trying to kill me?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cStiles, please! This is important!\u201d The look on Derek\u2019s face is so earnest, so Stiles steels himself and steps back over to the mound after the next ball crashes against the back fence. His palms are sweaty and nerves have him a bit unsteady on his feet, but Derek does this all the time. So do like ten year olds. Nothing dangerous about a pitching machine, nope, no way.</p>\n<p>When the next ball shoots from the machine, Stiles swings the bat\u2026and misses. He groans.</p>\n<p>\u201cAt least you\u2019re still at home plate,\u201d Derek calls out encouragingly. Stiles flicks him off.</p>\n<p>The next ball, Stiles actually connects with but sends it flying foul. The next one makes it onto the field, and Derek runs after it. \u201cThat was too wide left,\u201d Stiles yells across the field as Derek heads towards third base. \u201cI\u2019m shit at baseball.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d Derek smiles, finally approaching the ball as the next one shoots out. Startled, Stiles yelps again as it sails into the chain link, but the next one he sends into left field.</p>\n<p>They do this for over half an hour, until Stiles is hitting pretty regularly between left and center field and Derek is catching over half of the fly balls. After Stiles grounds the last ball towards short stop, he drops into the grass by home plate. Derek joins him a few moments later.</p>\n<p>\u201cSorry I\u2019m terrible,\u201d Stiles says as he offers Derek his Gatorade. </p>\n<p>\u201cNo, it helped a lot,\u201d Derek assures him as he takes the bottle and upends it, chugging half of it down. Stiles watches the way his Adam\u2019s apple bobs along his elongated throat, the sweat rolling down in rivulets that Stiles finds himself wanting to lick from Derek\u2019s skin. He tears his eyes away and shakes his head. <i>Bad thoughts, Stiles. Bad thoughts.</i></p>\n<p>Derek hands the near empty bottle back to Stiles and says, \u201cI\u2019m going to practice batting again. You mind?\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles shakes his head enthusiastically. \u201cOh, definitely no complaint here. I\u2019m just gonna crawl over there, out of the kill zone.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo lame,\u201d Derek says with a smile, pushing lightly at Stiles\u2019 shoulder as he gets up. </p>\n<p>As Derek hits pitch after pitch, Stiles grabs his cell phone and texts Scott. <i>Dude. At park with Derek. He\u2019s practicing, and I\u2019m helping, except I suck. Think you can randomly show up and then offer to practice with him? I think he\u2019s really worried about the championship.</i></p>\n<p>A few minutes later, a reply comes. <i>No prob. cu soon.</i></p>\n<p>Stiles is eating a bag of chips and watching Derek run sprints around the bases when Scott shows up with Allison. Stiles waves at him, and Allison walks over to Stiles while Scott makes for Derek.</p>\n<p>\u201cMcCall! What are you doing here?\u201d Derek smiles as he and Scott do the special not-so-secret baseball handshake they all have. Scott tried to teach it to him once, but Stiles is way too uncoordinated for something like that. \u201cDid Stiles call you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, man. Allison and I were out on a date when we saw the cars,\u201d Scott lies. Stiles is impressed it almost sounds like the truth. Especially since Scott is a terrible liar. \u201cThought I\u2019d come see if you two were playing a game without me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Scott and Derek talk about practicing while Stiles and Allison watch. It doesn\u2019t take long for Scott to grab a bat and start grounding balls for Derek. \u201cHe\u2019s much better at that than me,\u201d Stiles says as he watches Scott make a rather impressive hit that sets up a good practice play for Derek.</p>\n<p>Allison hums in agreement. \u201cMaybe,\u201d she says, \u201cBut Scott\u2019s not the one Derek called.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles turns to her. \u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSeems like Derek cared more about the company than the skill of the player,\u201d Allison responds.</p>\n<p>Stiles\u2019 cheeks heat up as he watches Scott and Derek practicing, Derek getting a much better work out than when he was with Stiles. \u201cI\u2019m probably the only loser with nothing better to do,\u201d Stiles mumbles. He hears Allison sigh beside him.</p>\n<p>A few minutes later, Stiles gets his skateboard from the Jeep and is setting up to do a kickflip on the field when he sees Allison on her cell phone. He guesses she got bored of watching Scott and Derek hit balls around (and honestly, Stiles never thought he\u2019d ever think <i>that</i> phrase.) </p>\n<p>Stiles tries some ridiculously complicated board flip he saw on a Youtube vid, then ends up tangled in his own feet and sprawled on his ass. He\u2019s glaring at Allison, who\u2019s laughing at him, when he hears Cora yell, \u201cYou suck, Stiles.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles lifts his head to see her and Kira walking towards him, and Jackson pulling his Porsche into a parking space with Lydia in the front seat. \u201cWhat in the hell are you doing here?\u201d Stiles looks over at Allison. \u201cThis is your doing, I can see Allison evil all over it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Allison huffs. \u201cI figured if Derek really wanted to practice, we should make it a real game.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo you called the entire baseball and softball teams?\u201d Stiles asks, leaning back, his palms flat against the grass. \u201cPlease say you didn\u2019t call the entire baseball team.\u201d</p>\n<p>Allison moves to get up, then leans closer to Stiles. \u201cI may be evil, but not <i>that</i> evil.\u201d She smiles, her dimples blinding Stiles. Pure evil, that one.</p>\n<p>Derek and Scott notice the gathering crowd, and jog over sweaty and dirty. Stiles wonders exactly how an unflattering uniform, a baseball cap, sweat, and dirt is just the recipe for The Hottest Thing Ever According To Stiles Stilinski. But Derek\u2019s just standing there, holding his baseball cap and wiping sweat from his forehead with the back of his arm, his hair flat and damp with a hat line, and Stiles is nearly drooling on himself. Stiles\u2019 eyes move over to Scott, who looks much the same. Nope, not all baseball players. Just Derek (and half of the MLB, if he\u2019s honest. But mostly just Derek).</p>\n<p>When Boyd shows up with Erica in tow right after that, they start breaking into teams. Stiles looks at Lydia and Erica, who are both dressed in black workout pants and racerback tank tops. \u201cAre you two going to betray me? Leave me on the bench all alone?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDamn straight, Stilinski,\u201d Erica says, pulling her hair back into a ponytail. Stiles snorts that she\u2019s wearing red lipstick, and Lydia is in full makeup. \u201cI\u2019m not going to let everyone else have all the fun.\u201d She runs off after Boyd, and Lydia gives him a small smile and a shrug before going after Jackson. </p>\n<p>Stiles grabs his skateboard and drags it behind him to the old metal bleachers. Scott steps up to the plate while Jackson stretches on the pitcher\u2019s mound. Boyd, Erica, Lydia, and Kira are all spread out across the field. </p>\n<p>Stiles sighs and sets his chin in his hand. He knows that this is better for Derek, because this is <i>real</i> practice instead of that poor imitation that they were doing, but Stiles can\u2019t help but feel the sting of disappointment. Before, he had Derek\u2019s undivided attention; now, he\u2019s sitting on the sidelines alone.</p>\n<p>As Jackson throws the first pitch, Derek looks around the park from where he\u2019s standing behind the chain link fence near Scott. He spies Stiles on the bleachers. A frown forms on his face as he jogs over to the bleachers.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat in the hell are you doing all the way over here?\u201d Derek asks, grumpy look on his face. </p>\n<p>\u201cUm, watching?\u201d Stiles replies.</p>\n<p>Derek rolls his eyes, the motion taking his whole head with it. \u201cYou\u2019re a moron,\u201d Derek says, grabbing Stiles\u2019 arm and tugging him to his feet. \u201cYou\u2019re on my team, dumbass.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou want me on your team?\u201d Stiles asks dumbly as he stumbles the few steps to the bottom of the bleachers. \u201cBut I\u2019m horrible. You\u2019re going to lose for sure.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek heaves an aggrieved sigh, and squeezes Stiles\u2019 arm. \u201cThis isn\u2019t about practice, not entirely. You called everyone here to help me \u2013 I know you did despite McCall\u2019s insistence that you didn\u2019t,\u201d Derek adds when Stiles opens his mouth to protest. \u201cWe need you on our team to make it even.\u201d When Stiles\u2019 face falls, because of course that\u2019s the reason, Derek leans closer and says, \u201cI <i>want</i> you on my team, you idiot.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI should say no just because you keep calling me names,\u201d Stiles says, unable to hide his grin as he walks over to the bench next to the third base line. \u201cAss.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek bumps into Stiles\u2019 shoulder with his own. \u201cLame.\u201d</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Stiles should stop thinking things were going to be any different between him and Derek at school. On Monday, he passes Derek in the hall, who just smiles and waves, but doesn\u2019t stop as he walks down the hall with his arm around Jennifer\u2019s shoulder, Jennifer talking as he listens.</p>\n<p>Boyd still sits with them at lunch, which Stiles admits is kinda weird, but Boyd is awesome, so he doesn\u2019t complain. Stiles learns that Boyd is actually hilarious when he talks, and the longer he sits with them the more he starts to open up. Stiles isn\u2019t sure if that\u2019s Erica\u2019s garrulous influence, his comfort for Stiles, Scott, Allison, Cora, and Kira, or something else. By the end of the week, Cora and Boyd are partners against Kira and Stiles at their newly established lunch time Spades tournament, and they are <i>vicious</i>. Boyd, man\u2026Boyd is cut throat. But Cora\u2019s hardly any different, and Stiles is pretty sure their newly formed friendship means the destruction of mankind, because Cora + Boyd? Terrifying.</p>\n<p>Despite what Derek had told him about fighting with Jennifer, Stiles sees Jennifer at Derek\u2019s house twice that week, and Derek gets home at almost midnight every night Jennifer\u2019s not there. It doesn\u2019t take a genius to figure out what he\u2019s been doing. </p>\n<p>Stiles spends the week reevaluating his feelings. Because, really? His pining crush is stupid. Derek is obviously only interested in Jennifer, and he and Derek are <i>just</i> friends. Stiles berates himself, because he <i>knows</i> that above all else, he wants Derek as a friend. Derek means too much to him for anything less. His stupid hormones could just get over themselves. Derek didn\u2019t like him like that, end of story. He never would. They are friends, and Stiles had to be okay with what they had.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Thursday, Stiles sits at baseball practice with Lydia, working on his latest sketch. This one\u2019s of Derek, his graduation gift that Stiles decided on the other day. Stiles is attempting to get Derek\u2019s eyebrows just perfect when he hears footsteps on the bleachers. He glances up and sees Jennifer and Kali coming towards them.</p>\n<p>\u201cHeads up,\u201d Stiles calls to Lydia as he turns his sketchpad back to an unfinished drawing of Kira. </p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got to be kidding me,\u201d Lydia mumbles as she glares at Jennifer.</p>\n<p>Jennifer approaches Stiles first. \u201cStan, I see you\u2019re here. Again.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cName\u2019s still Stiles. I don\u2019t understand what is so difficult about that.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jennifer gives him a saccharine smile. \u201cDoesn\u2019t it get boring, sitting here practice after practice, watching your friends do things you\u2019ll never do while you bury yourself in that sketchpad?\u201d She smiles wider. \u201cOr is it more personal than that? Deluding yourself that you have some strong friendship with him because you live next door to him, while staring at him, someone else\u2019s boyfriend, who would never even look twice at you if even if he <i>did</i> swing that way?\u201d Jennifer glances over her shoulder at Derek, hunched over in position at short stop. \u201cIt\u2019s borderline stalking.\u201d</p>\n<p>Evil witch, Stiles thinks. She has to be.</p>\n<p>\u201cOne day Derek is going to realize you\u2019re a horrible person,\u201d Stiles says. He ignores the sting of her words, the exact same things Stiles has told himself over and over. It just feels more real when it\u2019s coming from her instead of his own head.</p>\n<p>Jennifer scoffs. \u201cI\u2019m not a horrible person,\u201d she says. \u201cI just don\u2019t like pathetic losers lusting after my boyfriend. You do realize he just pities you, right?\u201d She looks down at him condescendingly, and Stiles wants to both slap her and curl into a ball. \u201cThat\u2019s the only reason he still talks to you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWow Jennifer,\u201d Lydia pipes up before Stiles can come up with a retort. \u201cThis looks an awful lot like a pathetic threatened girlfriend trying to intimidate the competition.\u201d Lydia narrows her eyes and gives Jennifer an evil smile. \u201cIf Stiles is such a loser who Derek pities, why are you wasting your time?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou better watch it, you ugly redheaded mathlete,\u201d Kali growls.</p>\n<p>Lydia tuts a few times. \u201cThat would hurt if it came from someone who didn\u2019t have nasty feet. Ever heard of a pedicure, Kali?\u201d</p>\n<p>Kali starts to lunge for Lydia, but Jennifer grabs her arm. </p>\n<p>\u201cYou think you\u2019re something Martin just because you\u2019re nailing Jackson,\u201d Jennifer spits. \u201cNo moderately popular eleventh grade slut is going to beat me for prom queen, no matter who you\u2019re sleeping with.\u201d With a flick of her hair, Jennifer and Kali storm down the bleachers.</p>\n<p>Stiles looks over at Lydia, who is shaking with rage. \u201cCan you believe what that bitch said to me?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t think you\u2019re a slut,\u201d Stiles says, picking awkwardly at the cuff of his hoodie, \u201cEven if your decision to have sex with Jackson is questionable.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lydia turns and glares at Stiles. \u201cNot that, Stiles! She said I was <i>moderately popular</i>!\u201d Lydia huffs. \u201cI\u2019ll show her moderately popular. I may not be on the pep squad, but I am student body president, captain of the volleyball team, and a nationally ranking mathlete. That complacent grin will be wiped off her face when I win prom queen.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles laughs, shaking his head. \u201cYou\u2019re unbelievable.\u201d Lydia just smiles at him, and Stiles laughs again and returns to his sketches.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>On Tuesday night, Stiles sneaks into the dive bar to hear this indie band Erica let him listen to last week on some podcast. He orders a Coke from the bartender Danielle, who knows he\u2019s underage. He\u2019s always afraid Danielle is gonna rat him out, but instead, she just glares at him judgmentally and splashes half his $2 Coke onto the counter.</p>\n<p>The band is good, and Stiles is leaning against the wall in the back, bobbing his head along with the music when someone slips beside him. He\u2019s surprised to see Isaac standing beside him.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey! Didn\u2019t know you were gonna be here,\u201d Stiles asks, looking around. \u201cWhere\u2019s Erica?\u201d</p>\n<p>Isaac shrugs. \u201cOut with Boyd somewhere. I told her about this, and she said she might show up.\u201d Stiles nods. Isaac\u2019s nursing a beer, attained with his fake ID; he and Erica both have one. Isaac offers the bottle to Stiles, and Stiles shakes his head.</p>\n<p>Isaac laughs. \u201cFigures.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cSheriff\u2019s son doesn\u2019t want to break the law.\u201d </p>\n<p>Stiles rolls his eyes. Sometimes he really hates being the sheriff\u2019s son. \u201cDude, it\u2019s a Tuesday night and I have a trig test tomorrow. Besides, it\u2019d hardly be my first sip of alcohol.\u201d Isaac shrugs and then turns back to the show. </p>\n<p>After the concert, Isaac and Stiles end up at the bar arguing music with Danielle, who glared a tad less judgmentally at Stiles when she realized his taste in music. By the time he and Isaac finally file out of the bar, it\u2019s after midnight.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis was fun,\u201d Isaac says. He\u2019s standing so aloof on the sidewalk, hands stuffed in his pockets, scanning their surroundings boredly. Stiles doesn\u2019t know how Isaac always looks so cool, with his scarves, old man sweaters, and t-shirts. </p>\n<p>\u201cYou should teach me how to be cool,\u201d Stiles blurts. \u201cYou\u2019re just so <i>cool</i>, you and Erica. Like, you just walk into a room and <i>cool</i> oozes from you like a disease.\u201d</p>\n<p>Isaac lifts an eyebrow as he walks past his car in favor of walking with Stiles towards his house. \u201cThat sounds kinda gross.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles groans in frustration. \u201cYou know what I mean. You with your stupid curls and scarves and stupid smirks. What I\u2019d give for like, a tenth of your coolness.\u201d</p>\n<p>Isaac is quiet, and the silence amplifies the situation between them. Stiles knows that Isaac is interested in dating him, and here they are, walking home together after spending the evening at a concert. He rubs a hand through his hair and over his face as he readjusts the grip on his skateboard. </p>\n<p>After a few minutes, Isaac asks, \u201cDo you remember me when I was in school?\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles tries to pull up a picture. He knows Isaac and Erica graduated with Laura two years ago, but he didn\u2019t know them then, just met them through The Rev. Stiles shakes his head.</p>\n<p>\u201cI was a scrawny comic book geek who no one looked at twice. Did you know I asked out Lydia my senior year?\u201d Stiles shakes his head; Lydia had never said she knew Isaac. \u201cShe said to come back when I drove something with more power than a bicycle chain.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOuch.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMy dad used to beat the hell out of me, I\u2019d come to school all bruised and hide in the locker room when I played lacrosse,\u201d Isaac explains. That stops Stiles because he had forgotten Isaac was on the lacrosse team. His face must show it, because Isaac smiles and says, \u201cDon\u2019t feel bad you don\u2019t remember me. I had a good habit in those days of fading into the background.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy are you telling me all this?\u201d Stiles asks, the heavy mood making him feel all weird. </p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m trying to make a point. I wasn\u2019t cool in high school, not by a long shot. Neither was Erica.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo what you\u2019re saying is that puberty was a lot nicer to you two than it\u2019s been to me?\u201d Stiles jokes as they turn on his street.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m saying things change, people change.\u201d Isaac shrugs. \u201cHigh school isn\u2019t the best years of your life.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThank god.\u201d They\u2019re quiet as they walk down Stiles\u2019 street. When they get to Stiles\u2019 house, the sheriff\u2019s car isn\u2019t in the driveway. His late shift is the only reason Stiles could stay out so late. His normal curfew is closer to eleven than one.</p>\n<p>Stiles looks over at Isaac, hands shoved into his pockets. Maybe, he thinks to himself as he looks at Isaac. Maybe one day things would be different and he could look at Isaac differently.</p>\n<p>\u201cSee you at work,\u201d Isaac says with a wave as he starts to head back towards the bar.</p>\n<p>\u201cThanks for making sure I got home safely.\u201d</p>\n<p>Isaac smiles and then turns around and walks away.</p>\n<p>Upstairs, Stiles toes off his shoes and nearly trips because he\u2019s unsteady on his feet. His head is swimming with confusing thoughts, and he\u2019s not quite sure he\u2019s ready to make huge life changing decisions.</p>\n<p>A light flicks on in the room next door, and Stiles looks up to see Derek at the window, waving and smiling. \u201cUniverse, you fucking suck,\u201d Stiles mumbles when his eyes rake over Derek\u2019s worn Henley and plaid pj pants. \u201cSuck so fucking much.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek lifts up the whiteboard. <i>Where have you been? It\u2019s late!</i></p>\n<p>Stiles snorts as he grabs his own board. He scribbles a response. <i>You got in at midnight all last week.</i></p>\n<p>Derek lifts an eyebrow. <i>Were you watching for when I got home?</i></p>\n<p>\n<i>Like you were me tonight?</i>\n</p>\n<p>Derek laughs and shakes his head. <i>I just hope you had fun. I\u2019m glad that you\u2019re going out.</i></p>\n<p>\n<i>Wow, Derek, thanks for making me feel like a total loser.</i>\n</p>\n<p>Derek frowns. <i>NOT WHAT I MEANT!!!!!!!!!!</i></p>\n<p>\n<i>I know. Night.</i>\n</p>\n<p><i>I really didn\u2019t mean that.</i> Stiles looks up to see Derek with his bottom lip jutting out, in full on puppy mode. He\u2019s so fucking adorable, Stiles hates him a little.</p>\n<p>\n<i>Fine! But seriously, I\u2019m gonna pass out now. Test tomorrow.</i>\n</p>\n<p>Derek waves and Stiles drops the white board to the floor.</p>\n<p>Definitely way too confusing for tonight.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Stiles is sitting on the grass near the sidewalk, skateboard beside him forgotten. He\u2019s so engrossed in his book that he doesn\u2019t hear the approaching footsteps.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou are gone,\u201d Derek says, dropping onto the grass beside him. Stiles looks up, trying to refocus his eyes and brain as he makes the transition from page to real life. Derek tilts his head and reads the title when Stiles marks his page and closes it. \u201c<i>Dune?</i> Is it any good?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFreaking great,\u201d Stiles responds. \u201cI can\u2019t seem to put it down.\u201d He drops the book to the grass beside him without a thought. \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d Derek\u2019s wearing a baseball cap, a t-shirt, and jeans cut off at the knee. He looks comfortable, but his smile doesn\u2019t quite reach his eyes.</p>\n<p>Derek shrugs. \u201cSaw you out here, thought I\u2019d come bother you for a bit.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou never bother me,\u201d Stiles says. </p>\n<p>\u201cI haven\u2019t really talked to you in like a week. How\u2019s it going?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSame. Not much happens in the land o\u2019 Stilinski.\u201d Stiles drops back onto the grass, basking in the sun. \u201cReady for the championship?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFucking terrified,\u201d Derek admits, mirroring his action. \u201cI keep trying not to think too much about it. It\u2019s next Friday\u2026how is that even possible?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019ll knock \u2018em dead,\u201d Stiles says. \u201cYou\u2019ll knock them all out of the park, and then one straight at Jackson\u2019s head just for me.\u201d Stiles grins, and Derek laughs. </p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll try my best.\u201d When he turns back to Stiles, there\u2019s a light in his eyes that wasn\u2019t there a moment before. Stiles curses whatever has been making Derek look so down, and just tries to do everything in his power to make Derek laugh.</p>\n<p>They talk for awhile before a small, expensive red convertible comes down the street. Stiles frowns. <i>Jennifer.</i> Stiles doesn\u2019t miss the way that Derek\u2019s mirth and relaxation is instantly gone, replaced by the rigid set of his shoulders.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, I guess I\u2019ll see you around Stiles.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, guess so.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles watches as Derek walks over and opens the passenger side door. As soon as Derek\u2019s seated, Jennifer pulls him into a passionate kiss, and Stiles has to hold his tongue from shouting something rude. When she wraps her arms around Derek\u2019s shoulders, Jennifer glances at Stiles and smirks. </p>\n<p>Stiles just shakes his head. If Jennifer sees him as a threat, she\u2019s got bigger problems than he does.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Stiles gets stuck closing with Isaac Friday night because Erica is on a date with Boyd. \u201cShe\u2019s been telling me all about their dates,\u201d Isaac tells Stiles as he sweeps. \u201cI did not need to know that much detail about their sex life.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles shudders. \u201cBoyd\u2019s my bro, but I have no desire to think about him and Erica\u2026\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cI know.\u201d Isaac flips through the records, trying to choose. \u201cWhat should we listen to as we close?\u201d Stiles doesn\u2019t have a preference, so Isaac puts on a Boston album while Stiles starts going through their nightly closing routine. They spend twenty minutes dancing around the store instead of working. Stiles turns the broom into a guitar and Isaac plays drums on the counter, and by the end of side A of the record, they\u2019re laughing and having a good time.</p>\n<p>Stiles locks the door, and when he returns to the counter, Isaac doesn\u2019t look like he\u2019s ready to go.</p>\n<p>\u201cGot any plans tonight?\u201d Isaac asks. Stiles shakes his head. \u201cI thought we could just hang for a bit.\u201d Isaac pulls out a small bag of marijuana, and Stiles stares at it. He\u2019s never smoked weed before, and he bites his lip uncertainly. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to, it\u2019s cool man. No pressure. You can just sit and chill if you want.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s not that,\u201d Stiles says, turning the overhead lights off as they walk into the back room. \u201cJust, sheriff\u2019s son here. No one\u2019s ever offered me drugs before. I kinda have always wanted to see what the big deal was.\u201d There\u2019s an old sofa along the wall, and Stiles drops onto it as Isaac puts a record on the ancient record player. He hears the familiar scratch before notes come out. He can\u2019t put his finger on it, but he knows the song from somewhere.</p>\n<p>Isaac sits beside Stiles, and Stiles watches him as he pulls an already rolled joint from the bag. \u201cYou sure about this?\u201d Isaac asks. Stiles nods, and Isaac puts the end between his lips and lights the tip. After he takes a hit, he hands it to Stiles.</p>\n<p>Stiles takes it from Isaac hesitantly and puts it between his lips. He takes a tentative inhale, and immediately starts coughing. Isaac just laughs and hits him on the back. \u201cYou\u2019ll get used to it. Easy now.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles finally inhales without coughing, and after a few minutes, he starts to feel a lightness in his head and body. He just lays back against the couch, staring at the far wall, listening to the music. After a few songs, Stiles finds himself grinning. \u201c<i>Summer Breeze</i>, this is Seals and Croft.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYep,\u201d Isaac says, lounging on the couch beside Stiles.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis shit is so lame,\u201d Stiles giggles, and now that he\u2019s started, he can\u2019t stop. \u201cThis is some bad FM shit right here.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t knock this record,\u201d Isaac says. \u201cIt\u2019s a perfect background for a good high.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles giggles again, but he finds himself totally digging the music. Something about it is soothing and familiar. \u201cThis is the greatest album ever.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFive seconds ago it was lame,\u201d Isaac says.</p>\n<p>\u201cDude, that was like five minutes ago.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSeriously, it was like thirty seconds.\u201d </p>\n<p>Stiles lifts his head and digs in his pocket for his cell phone. They\u2019ve only been sitting there for like fifteen minutes. \u201cDude, just\u2026dude.\u201d He giggles again.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re a fucking lightweight,\u201d Isaac says, laughing.</p>\n<p>\u201cHow strong is this shit?\u201d Stiles asks. \u201cIt\u2019s like I\u2019m in a time vortex. Like, time has stopped and we\u2019re just floating in a loop of <i>Summer Breeze</i>.\u201d Stiles starts singing along. He closes his eyes and lets the music roll over him, through his limbs until he\u2019s filled with it. \u201cThis is the greatest song ever recorded.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re so fucking high,\u201d Isaac laughs.</p>\n<p>\u201cMy mom loved this album,\u201d Stiles says. \u201cShe used to listen to Seals and Croft all the time.\u201d He smiles, though it\u2019s accompanied by a familiar ache. \u201cI haven\u2019t heard this song since she died. It\u2019s like she\u2019s right here with me, listening to the song and singing along.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDeep shit, man.\u201d</p>\n<p>They sit like that for a few more songs, and then Stiles rearranges himself so he can look at Isaac. \u201cYou\u2019re attractive, you know that?\u201d</p>\n<p>Isaac snorts. \u201cYes.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLike, not all dudes can pull off scarves, but like, you make it <i>work</i>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou could probably wear scarves.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles shakes his head. \u201cHoodies is about the extent of my fashion statement. Oh, that and plaid. I should totally have been a teenager in the 90s. Grunge and stuff.\u201d</p>\n<p>Isaac snorts and pushes himself off the couch. \u201cYou make me wanna listen to Bush.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBush\u2026good band,\u201d Stiles says. \u201cGavin Rossdale is <i>hawt</i>, still hot as fuck. I\u2019d do him.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDILF?\u201d Isaac asks. </p>\n<p>\u201cTotally.\u201d Stiles grins widely and laughs at nothing. Isaac puts on the vinyl version of <i>Sixteen Stone</i> and sits back down. </p>\n<p>\u201cYou wanna make out?\u201d Isaac asks. Stiles just blinks at him hesitantly. \u201cLook, I know you\u2019ve still got a major hard-on for Derek, but I\u2019m high, and I like kissing, and I like you. It doesn\u2019t mean we have to fuck or date or anything. I just like kissing when I\u2019m high.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles nods. \u201cOkay then.\u201d</p>\n<p>Isaac scoots closer and cups the side of Stiles\u2019 face, and Stiles watches from what feels like a million miles away as Isaac leans down and kisses him. His lips are soft and warm, and Stiles doesn\u2019t exactly know what he\u2019s feeling. His brain is fuzzy like cotton, and fuck, Isaac\u2019s mouth feels good against his. He grabs the front of his sweater and tugs him against him, and Isaac\u2019s body on his feels good, too. </p>\n<p>They kiss for a long time, just tongues and lips and a few hands sliding across chests and asses. It\u2019s pleasant, and Stiles feels a contented warmth spreading through him. But something is missing. Not that Isaac isn\u2019t hot as hell, or a fucking fantastic kisser\u2026it\u2019s just not who Stiles wants to be kissing. </p>\n<p>But Stiles is a seventeen year old boy, and this is the most action he\u2019s gotten\u2026ever. So he\u2019s not going to call it off. For as much as he knows, this could be the last person he kisses until college, and he\u2019s going to get his kiss on.</p>\n<p>So, Stiles repositions himself on his back, pulling Isaac on top of him. It\u2019s not ideal, but it\u2019ll do for now.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>They kiss for over two hours. When they stop, Stiles\u2019 lips are tingling and he\u2019s half hard. Isaac just sits up, lights another joint, and goes on talking like they didn\u2019t just spend the last two hours getting intimately acquainted with each other\u2019s tonsils.</p>\n<p>\u201cWant a ride home?\u201d Isaac asks as they exit the store awhile later. Stiles looks down at his skateboard, still flying high. </p>\n<p>\u201cProbably a good idea.\u201d Stiles stops though, and looks at Isaac. \u201cShould you be driving? Cause while I\u2019m ironically high as fuck, still a sheriff\u2019s kid here. Driving under the influence is a big no-no.\u201d</p>\n<p>Isaac leads them over to his car. \u201cI do this a lot more than you do,\u201d Isaac says as he gets into the front seat and leans across to unlock Stiles\u2019 door. \u201cI\u2019m not nearly as high as you.\u201d</p>\n<p>They argue about upcoming movies on the short ride to Stiles\u2019 house. Stiles\u2019 dad is thankfully not home, so Isaac rolls to a stop at the curb. </p>\n<p>\u201cThis was fun,\u201d Stiles says. \u201cYou\u2019re a good kisser.\u201d</p>\n<p>Isaac smiles. \u201cSo are you.\u201d Stiles gets distracted when he sees Derek\u2019s Camaro pull in next door. Isaac says, \u201cGo, your boyfriend just got home.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNot my boyfriend,\u201d Stiles grumbles.</p>\n<p>Isaac laughs quietly and shakes his head. \u201cSee you later, Stiles.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles gets out of the car, but has some trouble removing his skateboard from the backseat. As Isaac pulls away from the curb and Stiles starts towards the house, he catches sight of Derek crossing the yard to him.</p>\n<p>\u201cWas that Isaac?\u201d Derek asks, nodding towards the retreating car. Stiles nods. \u201cAre you two a thing now?\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles shakes his head, but then starts giggling. For some reason, it\u2019s the funniest thing ever that Derek asks if he and Isaac were a thing.</p>\n<p>Derek comes closer and peers at Stiles through narrowed eyes. \u201cAre you high?\u201d He leans closer and stares into Stiles\u2019 eyes. \u201cYou so are!\u201d </p>\n<p>Derek looks completely scandalized, so Stiles starts giggling anew and sways into Derek. \u201cSsh,\u201d he whispers, though he doesn\u2019t lower his voice. \u201cDon\u2019t tell my dad.\u201d Once he\u2019s leaning against Derek\u2019s shoulder, he just stays there. His forehead is pressed against Derek\u2019s clavicle and he\u2019s just laughing. God, Derek smells good, he thinks. He tilts his face up and sniffs at Derek\u2019s neck in between giggles. Stiles just laughs harder that he spent the evening with his face and tongue on Isaac\u2019s neck, but here he is, wanting nothing more than to kiss and lick Derek\u2019s neck instead. Or just snuggle. He\u2019d be content to just snuggle Derek for the rest of his life.</p>\n<p>This might be irony, he thinks. </p>\n<p>\u201cStiles?\u201d Derek asks. Derek\u2019s voice rumbles beneath Stiles\u2019 ear, a pleasant sound.</p>\n<p>\u201cI made out with Isaac,\u201d Stiles finally says, though he doesn\u2019t move away from Derek. Derek is warm, and solid, and Stiles is pretty sure if he moves his legs will give out. Derek\u2019s shoulder might just be the most comfortable place his head has ever laid.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d Derek says. \u201cI didn\u2019t expect that. Congrats. I told you you\u2019d get a boyfriend.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles slaps Derek\u2019s chest, and then leaves his hand there. Although Derek\u2019s chest is muscled, it just feels soft beneath Stiles\u2019 touch. \u201cNot my boyfriend.\u201d He starts giggling again. \u201cWe just made out. People do that, apparently, without sex or dating and stuff.\u201d Stiles shrugs. \u201cWho knew?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019ve done that.\u201d </p>\n<p>Stiles pushes himself off of Derek and looks at him glassy-eyed. \u201cWho did you casually make out with?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPaige.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles starts giggling again. \u201cThe girl from band who plays the cello?\u201d He giggles some more. \u201cShe\u2019s cute.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, she is,\u201d Derek says with a smile. </p>\n<p>\u201cIt was my first kiss, you know,\u201d Stiles says, leaning back into Derek because Derek doesn\u2019t seem to mind. Derek\u2019s arm is around his waist, supporting him, his fingers resting lightly on his hip. </p>\n<p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know that.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles nods and picks idly at the buttons on Derek\u2019s Henley. \u201cIt was fun, kissing is awesome, you know?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI do.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s just,\u201d Stiles sighs and closes his eyes. He inhales Derek, and knows in that moment there\u2019s no one else. If there was no Derek Hale, then Isaac would probably be perfect. But of course, there will always be Derek Hale, and right now Derek is it for him. </p>\n<p>Being wrapped up in him isn\u2019t helping matters, either. He never knew it would feel so perfect with Derek. It just throws what he did with Isaac in stark contrast. \u201cIsaac\u2019s cool, but there\u2019s not much there. I just want,\u201d <i>you</i>, he finishes in his head. Out loud, he says, \u201cSomething amazing.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou deserve something amazing,\u201d Derek says.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo do you,\u201d Stiles murmurs, and Derek doesn\u2019t disagree. A moment later, Stiles\u2019 brain catches up with what his body is doing, all but cuddling with Derek, and he pushes away, shaking his head. He feels totally pathetic, hanging all over Derek like some lovesick teenager. He shouldn\u2019t be acting like that, regardless of whether or not he actually is. \u201cI\u2019m so stupid,\u201d Stiles mutters. \u201cShe was totally right, you probably just pity me.\u201d Stiles takes an unsteady step away. \u201cI\u2019ve embarrassed myself enough. I\u2019m going inside now.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cStiles, wait, what?\u201d Derek asks, following Stiles. He reaches out and grabs Stiles\u2019 arm. \u201cWho said I pitied you? What are you even talking about? You\u2019re not making a lot of sense.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cProbably the weed.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek rolls his eyes. \u201cFocus. I don\u2019t pity you. Who said I did?\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles just stares at Derek, because that definitely was not supposed to come out. \u201cUm\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFucking Jennifer,\u201d Derek growls. </p>\n<p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t have to.\u201d Derek steps closer and looks at Stiles closely. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing for me to pity about you. You\u2019re awesome.\u201d Stiles snorts and sways, ending up leaning against Derek again. He places his palm flat against Derek\u2019s chest and lightly fingers the soft cotton of his shirt. \u201cI\u2019m serious. You\u2019re smart, funny, and always there when I need you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m like a dog,\u201d Stiles jokes as he relaxes into Derek again, his head drifting back to Derek\u2019s shoulder. Derek punches his arm. \u201cOw! Fucker.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cStop being such a fucking tool. I\u2019m sick of your self-deprecation.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Stiles says, closing his eyes. He\u2019s tired, and warm, and right now he\u2019s completely happy curling against Derek. </p>\n<p>\u201cStiles, are you falling asleep?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNope,\u201d Stiles murmurs.</p>\n<p>\u201cReally? Come on,\u201d Derek wraps his arm around Stiles\u2019 waist again, this time tighter, and Stiles snuggles into him. Everything about this feels <i>right</i>and <i>perfect</i>, like Derek\u2019s arms were made just for Stiles to fit into. </p>\n<p>\u201cKeys?\u201d Derek asks, and Stiles digs into his pocket to pull them out. Derek unlocks the door and leads Stiles upstairs to his bedroom. Stiles plops face first onto the bed, and he notices remotely that Derek is removing his shoes. </p>\n<p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Stiles mumbles against the bed.</p>\n<p>\u201cFor what?\u201d Derek asks softly.</p>\n<p>\u201cFor being you.\u201d</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Stiles wakes up Saturday morning before his alarm and just lies in bed. </p>\n<p>He got kissed last night. He made out last night, with Isaac. He has no longer <i>never been kissed</i>. Stiles Stilinski has been kissed and more kissed. His fingers go to his neck where Isaac had licked and kissed (but thankfully no hickey), but there\u2019s no tingles, no butterflies in his stomach. He thinks about kissing Isaac again, but all that excites him is the <i>idea</i> of kissing, not the person.</p>\n<p>But Derek\u2026Stiles thinks about what happened after Isaac dropped him off. Stiles closes his eyes and remembers the way it felt to lean against Derek\u2019s body, draw comfort from his warmth; remembers the way it felt to have Derek\u2019s arm around his waist. There\u2019s a bit of mortification burning in his belly, but there\u2019s an annoying voice behind him that keeps saying that Derek didn\u2019t seem to mind. He ignores that voice, because that voice is stupid. </p>\n<p>At work, things are normal between him and Isaac. Isaac doesn\u2019t treat him any differently, and doesn\u2019t bring up what they did the night before. Stiles appreciates that, appreciates that he could have casual make out sessions without it meaning something. The last thing he wanted was another confusing relationship in his life.</p>\n<p>On Monday morning, Stiles tells Scott about Friday. \u201cWhy do you always have all the fun?\u201d Scott asks. \u201cI\u2019ve never smoked pot to lame 70s music and gotten high and made out.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles rolls his eyes. \u201cDude, you have sex on a regular basis. I am hardly having any more fun than you have.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cStill could have called,\u201d Scott pouts. \u201cI want us to get high and do cool stuff, like play video games and watch movies.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd we will,\u201d Stiles claps Scott on the shoulder. \u201cWhat do you think college is for?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI guess.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPlus, remember that you have the state championship this weekend. You can\u2019t be off your game.\u201d</p>\n<p>Scott huffs. \u201cWe are so partying hard on Saturday night whether we win or lose.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDude, of course. There\u2019s a bottle of tequila with our names on it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Scott grins.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Monday night, Stiles looks up from his homework when a red laser point shoots across his book. He glances through his window and sees Derek at his bedroom window, holding a laser pointer and grinning. Stiles gets up and walks to the window. Derek holds up his board.<i>HEY</i></p>\n<p>Stiles smiles and responds, <i>HEY.</i></p>\n<p>\n<i>I have something for you. Come over?</i>\n</p>\n<p>Stiles nods, tells his dad he\u2019s going over there, and then knocks on Derek\u2019s front door. Peter opens the door, grinning widely.</p>\n<p>\u201cStiles, my favorite non-relative teenager,\u201d Peter says, ushering Stiles in with a hand on his shoulder. \u201cHow glad I am to see you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNice to, uh, see you too,\u201d Stiles says awkwardly. </p>\n<p>\u201cDerek didn\u2019t tell me you\u2019d be visiting,\u201d Peter says, leading Stiles into the kitchen. \u201cThough you are free to join us for dinner.\u201d He points to a spread of raw vegetables and other unidentifiable foods on the table.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve already eaten, but uh thanks,\u201d Stiles smiles.</p>\n<p>Peter smiles and pauses to just look at Stiles. \u201cI can\u2019t tell you how glad I am that you and Derek have been spending more time together. He\u2019s been kind of down lately, but he smiles more when he\u2019s been with you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles just blinks, because what\u2019s he supposed to do with <i>that?</i></p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re good for him,\u201d Peter says, cocking his head to the side and eyeing Stiles like he knows <i>exactly</i> how Stiles feels about Derek. \u201cYou always have been.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUh,\u201d Stiles says, because this conversation isn\u2019t what he expected. But Derek comes down a moment later, dressed in basketball shorts and a wife beater.</p>\n<p>\u201cThere you are,\u201d Derek says with a wide grin. \u201cIs Peter trying to get you to eat his weird raw food?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDerek, it\u2019s healthy. It cleanses the body, and the mind,\u201d Peter says, waving his hands from his head all the way to his legs. \u201cPackaged food clogs your soul, and cooking drains the life from the food. Man was not intended to have fire, they were intended to fear fire and live off only what the earth gives them. The moment you cook food, it devitalizes it. You basically destroy through cooking.\u201d He gives them both a placid smile, and Stiles looks at Derek. Derek\u2019s just staring at Peter like he\u2019s a weirdo.</p>\n<p>\u201cSure, Uncle Peter, whatever you say.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter shakes his head with a fond smile. \u201cAh, the blissful ignorance of youth! Go, enjoy yourselves while you are young.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles follows Derek out of the kitchen and up to his bedroom. Stiles glances at Cora\u2019s closed door when they walk by her room, loud rock music blaring from inside. Derek closes his door behind them, and gives Stiles an apologetic smile. Stiles just laughs. \u201cHe\u2019s such a weirdo.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cRight?\u201d Derek laughs, shaking his head. \u201cI thought I was just being overly critical.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, dude\u2019s seriously whack.\u201d Stiles chuckles as he walks around the edge of Derek\u2019s room, stopping in front of all his baseball trophies. They read things like MVP, Region Champ, Highest Home Run Average, and Most Sportsmanlike. Stiles reaches out and picks up the High School All-Star trophy from last year. \u201cThat game was incredible,\u201d Stiles says quietly. \u201cThat double play you helped with, and those two home runs? That pitcher was such a smug asshole until you showed him.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBest night of my life,\u201d Derek grins. \u201cThat was the game, that was the game where I thought, \u2018Hey, I might actually be able to do this.\u2019 It was an amazing feeling.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cJust think,\u201d Stiles says, carefully setting the trophy back on the shelf, \u201cSoon you\u2019ll have a state championship to add to this and a scholarship to boot. Before you know it, you\u2019ll be playing for the minor leagues, unless you get drafted by the MLB straight out of college.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek smiles, staring at Stiles for a beat too long. \u201cHow do you have that much faith in me? My own family doesn\u2019t even have that much faith in me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles shrugs. \u201cSomeone\u2019s got to, because it\u2019s true.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek goes over to his desk, and Stiles feels that familiar tingling he\u2019s started to get around Derek in his lips and fingers. He sighs and sits on the bed. Derek hasn\u2019t mentioned Stiles\u2019 behavior the other night, and Stiles is glad because he was mortified enough that Derek witnessed it in the first place. He would have died if Derek would have mentioned it to him.</p>\n<p>\u201cI made you something,\u201d Derek says, grabbing an object from his desk. He hands it to Stiles. </p>\n<p><b>DEREK\u2019S I\u2019M SORRY MIX</b> is scrawled on a burned CD.</p>\n<p>Stiles looks up at Derek. \u201cYou don\u2019t have anything to be sorry for.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI still feel bad for the Ennis thing,\u201d Derek says, sitting beside Stiles on the bed. \u201cIt should have been titled \u2018Derek\u2019s I\u2019m-Sorry-And-Thank-You-For-Being-So-Awesome-and-Supportive-To-Me Mix,\u2019 but that didn\u2019t fit.\u201d Stiles laughs, his face nearly breaking with his grin. \u201cYou deserve more than a CD, Stiles, but this is all I have.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s perfect,\u201d Stiles says as he stares down at Derek\u2019s handwriting across the silver disc. </p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Stiles goes home and listens to the CD on repeat, puts it on his iPod and listens to it all day at school the next day. </p>\n<p>The songs aren\u2019t new or hip, mostly classic stuff and songs they\u2019ve listened to together for years, but Stiles can\u2019t help but smile as each song switches to the next. Even the songs Stiles doesn\u2019t like that much, or had thought were lame before this, have a different meaning.</p>\n<p>Derek\u2019s made him numerous CDs over the last three years, but something about this one feels different. Stiles feels like maybe there\u2019s some hidden message in the words, in the song choices.</p>\n<p>Stiles thinks he\u2019s probably just crazy. But he keeps looking anyway.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Stiles isn\u2019t surprised when he hears the knock on the door Tuesday night. It\u2019s after ten p.m., and his dad is asleep in the recliner with an empty whiskey glass beside him. Stiles quietly walks through the house and opens the door.</p>\n<p>Derek\u2019s standing on the porch, looking wrecked. His eyes are red and puffy, with dark circles underneath them. He looks like he hasn\u2019t brushed his hair, and he might be wearing the same clothes from the night before. But none of this surprises Stiles, just like he wasn\u2019t surprised when Derek missed school earlier today.</p>\n<p>Without a word, Stiles steps aside and lets Derek enter. Derek goes through the house, leaving Stiles behind to grab his dad\u2019s bottle of whiskey. Stiles finds Derek outside the attic window, sitting on the roof. Stiles sits down beside him and hands him the bottle. Stiles doesn\u2019t drink anything, just lets Derek take as many sips from it as he needs.</p>\n<p>The reason none of this surprises Stiles is because three years ago tonight, Derek\u2019s parents were killed in a car crash. This has become their ritual, Derek showing up at Stiles\u2019 door looking wrecked, and Stiles sitting on top of the roof with Derek well into the night.</p>\n<p>Stiles doesn\u2019t know what Cora or Laura do on this night. He just knows that Derek misses school to drive out to the cemetery, and then he shows up at Stiles\u2019 door. </p>\n<p>Derek doesn\u2019t hold back the tears, and Stiles doesn\u2019t say a word as Derek sobs beside him. Derek\u2019s never tried to hide his grief on this night, is all smiles the day before and the day after, but this night is raw and vulnerable, the only thing swallowing the sounds of his sobs the silence and the stars. Stiles understands at least half of the pain Derek feels, faces the same thing on a fall day each year. And Stiles can\u2019t help but think about his mother, to grieve for her as much as he grieves for Derek\u2019s loss. Stiles doesn\u2019t try to offer Derek any comfort, because if the last eight years has taught him anything, it\u2019s that nothing can fill that void. You just have to deal with it your own way. Stiles\u2019 way is through avoidance; this is Derek\u2019s way.</p>\n<p>Derek\u2019s sobs taper off after awhile and he just sits there quietly beside Stiles. Without looking at Derek, Stiles reaches out beside him and takes his hand.</p>\n<p>Derek turns his hand over and threads their fingers together and squeezes.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>\u201cVote Lydia Martin for Prom Queen!\u201d Stiles says as the people go past the table. He holds out the small bundle of lollipops tied with a red bow and a VOTE FOR LYDIA label.</p>\n<p>\u201cMore conviction!\u201d Lydia snaps. \u201cThese people have to feel your enthusiasm.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDude, seriously?\u201d Stiles asks. \u201cI can\u2019t get more convicted that this.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUnless they put you in jail,\u201d Scott says, then starts laughing at his own joke. Everyone at the table groans, including Allison. \u201cWhat? I thought it was funny.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYour jokes suck,\u201d Stiles says before grabbing a handful of lollipops. \u201cVote for Lydia!\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cYo, freshman,\u201d Cora barks out. A freshman boys turns to her, eyes wide in fear. \u201cVote Lydia for Prom Queen.\u201d She hands the kid a bundle of candy. \u201cOtherwise I\u2019ll pummel you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCora!\u201d Lydia exclaims. She turns to the freshman and gives him a dazzling smile. \u201cShe\u2019s just joking, of course. My friends, such tricksters.\u201d Lydia shakes her hair with a laugh, then leans forward and kisses the freshman on the cheek. \u201cVote Lydia.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes ma\u2019am,\u201d the boy says, nearly tripping over himself as he touches his cheek.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re an evil vixen,\u201d Stiles says. \u201cI\u2019m terrified of you. You and Allison.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHey!\u201d Cora exclaims, punching his arm hard. </p>\n<p>\u201cOwwww,\u201d Stiles groans, rubbing his arm. \u201cI\u2019m always terrified of you.\u201d Cora smiles, obviously pleased. \u201cWhat is it with you and Derek and punching me?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy did Derek punch you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe told me I was being self-deprecating or something on Friday night. Fucker left a bruise, too.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know you were with Derek Friday night,\u201d Cora says. \u201cHe had a date with Jennifer.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI thought you were with Isaac,\u201d Scott asks.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re dating Isaac?\u201d Kira asks. </p>\n<p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou made out with him,\u201d Scott says.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou did what?\u201d Allison says, leaning across Scott and grabbing Stiles\u2019 arm. Stiles yelps again.</p>\n<p>\u201cSeriously, fragile teenage boy here.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAs interesting as Stiles\u2019 sudden love life is,\u201d Lydia interrupts, pointing to the people filing by during their lunch period. \u201cCan we please focus? We can talk about who Stiles makes out and spends his time with <i>after</i> I\u2019m crowned prom queen.\u201d</p>\n<p>A few minutes later, Derek walks up to their table. Stiles is surprised when Derek walks up to him, not Cora. The entire table, including Lydia, all turn to stare at them. Stiles\u2019 cheeks heat with embarrassment.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey Stiles,\u201d Derek says. He smiles at Stiles for awhile, before turning to everyone else. \u201cHey!\u201d He leans over and pops Cora on the head. \u201cHey loser.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShut up, loser,\u201d Cora replies, slapping Derek\u2019s hand away.</p>\n<p>Derek turns back to Stiles and just looks at him, so Stiles says, \u201cVote Lydia?\u201d He hands Derek a bouquet of lollipops. Derek takes them with a laugh.</p>\n<p>\u201cShe has you campaigning, huh?\u201d Derek asks, reading the label covered in pink glitter. </p>\n<p>\u201cOh yeah,\u201d Stiles says. \u201cI think I should have partial custody of her crown if she wins.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIn your dreams,\u201d Lydia sing-songs as someone approaches the table. Derek watches her, shaking his head. </p>\n<p>\u201cI guess there\u2019s no use in trying to sway the other side\u2019s vote, huh?\u201d Stiles asks. </p>\n<p>Derek shrugs. \u201cWho knows? Weirder things have happened.\u201d Derek takes one of the lollipops from the bouquet and unwraps it before sticking it in his mouth. Stiles stares open-mouthed as Derek sucks on it until Kira elbows him in the ribs. </p>\n<p>\u201cDid you want something?\u201d Stiles blurts. Derek takes one of the remaining lollipops out of the bouquet and hands it to Stiles.</p>\n<p>\u201cPeach is your favorite, right?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t I get one?\u201d Cora looks between Stiles and Derek. \u201cWhat\u2019s my favorite flavor, Derek?\u201d she asks as Stiles takes the proffered candy. </p>\n<p>Derek shrugs. \u201cHow am I supposed to know?\u201d he asks around the candy still in his mouth. \u201cCherry?\u201d</p>\n<p>Cora smirks. \u201cNot since I was like six.\u201d Derek just shrugs again and turns his attention back to Stiles.</p>\n<p>\u201cCan you come to dinner tomorrow?\u201d Derek asks.</p>\n<p>\u201cHuh?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI want you to come to dinner tomorrow, I have a surprise,\u201d Derek smiles, but immediately turns to Cora and points his finger. \u201cDon\u2019t ruin it.\u201d Cora puts her palms up in surrender.</p>\n<p>\u201cAre we having a Peter\u2019s Raw Special?\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek shakes his head. \u201cI think we\u2019re getting take out.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSold.\u201d </p>\n<p>Derek grins.</p>\n<p>\u201cHale, what in the hell do you think you\u2019re doing?\u201d Ennis yells from down the walkway. Stiles doesn\u2019t miss the way Derek groans and squares his shoulders. \u201cFraternizing with the enemy!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWow, Ennis, I didn\u2019t know you knew any words that big,\u201d Stiles says. Ennis turns his death glare on Stiles, and Cora and someone else punch him under the table. </p>\n<p>\u201cDid you say something, Stalonzy?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll ask him if he drops by if he did,\u201d Stiles grins cheekily. Derek puts a hand on his face and shakes his head.</p>\n<p>Ennis makes a show of making a fist and being generally aggressively intimidating towards Stiles before turning to Derek. \u201cSeriously, Jennifer\u2019s gonna flip when she finds out you were at this table with these losers.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOne of those people you just called a loser is my sister,\u201d Derek points out.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, really?\u201d Ennis\u2019 eyes scan the table\u2019s occupants and land on Cora. \u201cHer, right? Yeah, she\u2019s kinda hot.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNot if you were the last man on earth,\u201d Cora drawls. </p>\n<p>Ennis grabs his crotch and tugs. \u201cYou\u2019d be lucky to be with a real man like this.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHey, that\u2019s my sister!\u201d Derek exclaims as Cora makes fake vomiting noises.</p>\n<p>\u201cProbably a frigid bitch in bed anyway,\u201d Ennis shrugs. Stiles watches as Cora\u2019s eyes flash, and Kira puts a hand on her shoulder to keep her from launching herself across the table at Ennis. But Derek pushes him instead.</p>\n<p>\u201cSeriously, what the fuck? That\u2019s <i>my sister!</i>\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cChill, Hale!\u201d Ennis says, pushing Derek back. \u201cWhat has gotten into you lately? Jennifer\u2019s right, you\u2019re acting all weird.\u201d Ennis gives the table and then Derek a final disdainful look. \u201cWhatever. Not worth my time. You can circle jerk with these losers all day for all I care, Hale.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI <i>hate</i> that guy,\u201d Scott says to Ennis\u2019 retreating back.</p>\n<p>\u201cDerek, your friends are assholes,\u201d Cora says.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry about what he said Cora,\u201d Derek says, still staring after Ennis with a deep frown.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou think I give a fuck what that Neanderthal thinks of me?\u201d Cora asks. \u201cBut you need better friends than those assholes.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek sighs. \u201cCora, we\u2019re not going through this again.\u201d He gives a final wave to the table. \u201cSee you.\u201d</p>\n<p>After Derek\u2019s gone, Stiles turns to Cora. \u201cWhat does he mean, again?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s nothing,\u201d Cora mutters, watching as Derek walks away. Then, she turns to Stiles and glances at the sucker he\u2019s still holding. \u201cPeach, interesting.\u201d Her smirk is back.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s nothing,\u201d Stiles says, turning towards a group of approaching seniors. \u201cVote Lydia!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMmhmm,\u201d he hears Cora hum behind him.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Stiles messes with his hair the entire walk next door, wondering if the t-shirt and jeans combo is okay. He really has no clue <i>why</i> he\u2019s going to Derek\u2019s for dinner, so he put on his nicest jeans and favorite t-shirt and figures that will be okay.</p>\n<p>Cora opens the door, all grin. \u201cOh no,\u201d Stiles asks, taking a step back. \u201cYou didn\u2019t bring me over here to kill me or something, did you? You look way too happy.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGet in here,\u201d Cora says, grabbing Stiles\u2019 hand and yanking him inside. Stiles allows himself to be pulled into the living room. Where he sees Derek sitting on the couch, and Laura sitting in an armchair.</p>\n<p>\u201cLaura!\u201d Stiles exclaims, running across the room and jumping into her lap. She emits a soft <i>\u201doof!</i>\u201d as Stiles hugs her. \u201cYou\u2019re home!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cStiles,\u201d Laura protests and tries to push Stiles off of her, but Stiles just rearranges himself until he\u2019s fitted into the space between Laura and the chair. She looks slightly uncomfortable, but they\u2019ve been doing this for years. Laura is weird about personal space, doesn\u2019t like people touching her too much, but Stiles has no concept of personal boundaries. Plus, she\u2019s basically the sister he never had. It only takes about thirty seconds of a pinched face before Laura sighs and relaxes slightly. Stiles grins and kisses her on the cheek. She rubs at it like he\u2019s got cooties. </p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve missed you,\u201d Stiles beams, then turns to Derek. \u201cThis was my surprise?\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek nods. \u201cI was going to tell you, but thought I\u2019d surprise you instead.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles snuggles closer to Laura, who pushes him away. \u201cMy own Laura-shaped surprise.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cStiles, really,\u201d Laura says. \u201cGet a hold of yourself.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou can\u2019t blame me,\u201d Stiles says, straightening up. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen you since Christmas. How\u2019s school?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTerrible,\u201d Laura replies. </p>\n<p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Stiles asks, concerned.</p>\n<p>\u201cAll these guys want to sleep with me,\u201d Laura complains. \u201cThey keep asking me out, and some of them ask if I\u2019m DTF. You know, down to fuck.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles just blinks at her. \u201cI fail to see how this is a problem.\u201d From beside him, Cora slaps him across the back of the head. \u201cHey! What\u2019s that for?\u201d Cora stares at him pointedly, but Stiles is still completely lost, so he turns back to Laura and asks, \u201cSo, why\u2019s this a problem?\u201d Cora sighs behind him.</p>\n<p>\u201cNone of these guys care a thing about what I\u2019m interested in or what I do,\u201d Laura says. \u201cThey\u2019re just interested in the way I look and want to get into my pants. Apparently, I\u2019m considered a hot chick.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, duh.\u201d Cora slaps him again. \u201cUgh, seriously, Cora?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m just not interested in any cock that comes my way,\u201d Laura says.</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I need to be here during this conversation,\u201d Derek groans, covering his face with his hands. Laura rolls her eyes and Stiles snorts.</p>\n<p>\u201cI went on a few dates with some of those guys,\u201d Laura says. \u201cAnd it was all the same. I\u2019d try to make conversation, talk about the latest book I was reading or something interesting I learned for a research paper I wrote, and they\u2019d just stare at me like I wasn\u2019t even speaking English. When I asked one guy what his favorite book was, he said he didn\u2019t read, can you imagine? What do you talk or think about if you don\u2019t <i>read</i>? And then another guy, he said <i>The DaVinci Code</i>!\u201d Laura huffs. \u201cRidiculous. I find more pleasure from sitting in my dorm room on a Friday night than conversing with a bunch of idiots who think Dan Brown is great literature.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles throws his head back and laughs. God, how he\u2019s missed Laura. \u201cYou still could have slept with them anyway,\u201d he finally says.</p>\n<p>\u201cNot everybody wants sex.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI disagree.\u201d</p>\n<p>Cora says, \u201cMe, too.\u201d She shrugs. \u201cBut we\u2019re a bunch of virgins.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m a virgin, and I\u2019m perfectly happy to wait until some guy mentally stimulates me before I hop into bed with him.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles chuckles and elbows Laura lightly. \u201cMentally stimulates you.\u201d Laura sighs and rolls her eyes.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, but you\u2019re Laura and in a committed relationship with you books and headphones,\u201d Cora says. \u201cSome of us, like me, still have our V-card, but definitely not for a lack of trying.\u201d Stiles nods sympathetically.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhoa, whoa, wait,\u201d Derek cuts in, \u201cwho have <i>you</i> been trying with?\u201d</p>\n<p>Cora huffs and crosses her arms over her chest angrily. \u201cNone of your business.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, it is my business,\u201d Derek says. \u201cI swear, I will kick some guy\u2019s ass if he\u2019s been trying to get in your pants.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDidn\u2019t you hear a word I just said, Derek?\u201d Cora snaps. \u201cVirgin here! <i>No one</i> has been in my pants.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cGood,\u201d Derek says in relief, and Cora flips him off.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy are you the only one that gets to have sex?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, Derek,\u201d Laura asks, nudging Stiles in the side and grinning. \u201cSeems like a huge misogynistic double standard that you can have sex with Jennifer, but Cora can\u2019t have sex without you flipping out.\u201d Stiles shakes with silent laughter. He forgot how hilarious it was to watch Cora and Laura gang up on their brother.</p>\n<p>\u201cBut, she\u2019s my sister,\u201d Derek grumbles. </p>\n<p>\u201cNot your property,\u201d Laura states.</p>\n<p>\u201cFine! Cora can have sex with whoever she wants, but the moment some guy breaks her heart or uses her, I\u2019m going to fucking kill him.\u201d</p>\n<p>Laura looks at Stiles and shrugs. \u201cThat\u2019ll work for now, I guess.\u201d Stiles laughs.</p>\n<p>But Cora just groans. \u201cJust, butt out, Derek!\u201d she yells, getting up from the couch and storming towards the door. Laura reaches out and grabs Cora\u2019s arm. </p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t storm off,\u201d Laura says, refusing to let go when Cora tries to pull from her grip. \u201cI never see you. You can be pissed off at Derek and the world another day.\u201d</p>\n<p>Cora grunts but returns to the couch, kicking Derek as she passes. Stiles just laughs quietly.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo, in short, school is great, but the social aspect is disappointing,\u201d Laura tells Stiles. </p>\n<p>Stiles nods sympathetically. \u201cYes, that sounds horrible. Except, you know, the whole everyone wanting to sleep with you part. That part sounds awesome.\u201d</p>\n<p>Laura sighs and shakes her head.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnyway, it\u2019s nice to be home for the summer,\u201d Laura says, smiling at her siblings. \u201cEspecially this week.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles looks away awkwardly, letting the Hale\u2019s have their moment. It shouldn\u2019t have surprised Stiles that Laura came home this weekend, not with this week being the anniversary of their parents\u2019 death. He almost feels like he shouldn\u2019t be here, doesn\u2019t know why he is.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not looking forward to driving two hours to sit through a baseball game,\u201d Laura says.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey!\u201d Derek tosses a cushion at Laura\u2019s head, but it hits Stiles instead. Derek laughs. \u201cOops!\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cAss,\u201d Stiles laughs as he chucks the pillow at Derek, clipping the table lamp. Derek looks at the lamp with wide eyes and a smile, then back to Stiles.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not you, Derek,\u201d Laura says. \u201cBaseball is just so boring. You\u2019re the only thing that makes it remotely passable, but I\u2019m bringing a book and my headphones for when you\u2019re not playing.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLaura, really?\u201d Derek whines. She shrugs, and Stiles sticks his finger in Laura\u2019s ear. She squeaks, and Stiles starts tickling her.</p>\n<p>\u201cStiles,\u201d Laura squeals, \u201cI\u2019m going to kill you!\u201d </p>\n<p>Cora pulls out her cell phone and starts snapping pictures. Then, she comes over and slaps both of them. \u201cStop, do a selfie with me.\u201d She holds out the phone and Stiles presses his head against Laura\u2019s and smiles.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey! What about me?\u201d Derek exclaims.</p>\n<p>\u201cThen get your ass over here!\u201d Cora yells.</p>\n<p>Derek pushes Cora out of the way and squeezes against Stiles\u2019 other side, basically sitting in Derek\u2019s lap. Stiles turns his face as Cora hits the button, and Derek is already looking at him. Their faces are extremely close together, and Derek\u2019s eyes dart down quickly and then back to Stiles\u2019 eyes. Stiles swallows, and thinks he spies a blush creeping on Derek\u2019s cheek when Cora slaps the back of his head.</p>\n<p>\u201cTurn to the camera, goober.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re a goober,\u201d Stiles mutters, grinning widely. Derek tilts his head until he and Stiles are pressed crown to crown.</p>\n<p>Stiles misses Derek\u2019s heavy weight the moment he moves off the chair. Cora fools around on her phone while Laura, Derek, and Stiles talk more about her semester at school. </p>\n<p>\u201cPosted!\u201d Cora announces a few minutes later. \u201cThose are the best. I look particularly awesome. Stiles, you can see straight up your nose in one of them. And Laura looks cross-eyed.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Stiles exclaims. Laura sighs when Stiles rolls on top of her so he can dig his cell phone out of his pants. He opens Instagram, where there are five consecutive photos. One of Laura and Stiles talking together in the chair, a selfie of Cora, one of Derek on the other end of the couch with Stiles and Laura in the background, then the selfie of the four of them. The last photo, though, is another group selfie, but this one has Derek and Stiles looking at each other, and maybe Stiles is imagining it, but the look on Derek\u2019s face isn\u2019t that different than the one on Stiles\u2019, and Stiles is looking at Derek like he hung the moon.</p>\n<p>Laura glances over his shoulder, where he\u2019s staring at the picture of him and Derek. She makes a soft noise, and Stiles quickly scrolls up his feed.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou cannot see up my nose,\u201d Stiles mutters, \u201cMuch.\u201d </p>\n<p>A few minutes later, Derek\u2019s phone rings, and he stands. \u201cHey Jen,\u201d he says, stepping out of the room. </p>\n<p>\u201cQueen Evil Witch calls, shocker,\u201d Cora says, tapping away on her phone. \u201cIronic I post pictures on Instagram and she calls just moments later.\u201d</p>\n<p>Laura turns to the door Derek just walked through with a frown. They can hear Derek\u2019s raised voice from the dining room. \u201cWhat\u2019s up with them?\u201d she asks.</p>\n<p>\u201cThey fight every night,\u201d Cora responds without looking up from her phone. \u201cHe spends more time on the phone with her trying to placate her fragile, inflated ego than he does doing anything else.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThey\u2019ve been spending every afternoon together, too,\u201d Stiles says. Laura raises an eyebrow.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, they haven\u2019t,\u201d Cora says.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, he has; he\u2019s been coming home late,\u201d Stiles says.</p>\n<p>\u201cHow do you know that?\u201d Laura asks. Stiles flushes.</p>\n<p>\u201cOnly some of those are with Jennifer. He\u2019s been spending a lot of time with Boyd, Danny, and Jackson.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cReally?\u201d Stiles asks. </p>\n<p>Cora nods, knowing look on her face. \u201cYep,\u201d she says, popping her p. \u201cQueen Evil Witch hasn\u2019t been happy about that, either.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHuh,\u201d Stiles says, staring at his feet as he considers what this means. He\u2019d been under the impression that Derek had been spending more time with Jennifer. <i>Doesn\u2019t change anything,</i> a voice in his head whispers.</p>\n<p>When he looks up, he finds Laura studying him carefully. He rolls his eyes. \u201cShut up.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDidn\u2019t say a word.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek returns a few minutes later. Cora sets her cell phone on the side table and asks, \u201cWhat did the witch have to say?\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek glares at her. \u201cShe, um,\u201d Derek hesitates, looking over at Stiles. \u201cShe asked me why I didn\u2019t invite her over when my sister came home but I invited Stiles.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cA little jealous is she?\u201d Cora asks gleefully. </p>\n<p>\u201cCora, can you not?\u201d Derek snaps. \u201cI do not feel like listening to your bullshit on top of everything else.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDerek, is everything okay?\u201d Laura asks.</p>\n<p>\u201cFine.\u201d He huffs as he sits back on the couch, and crosses his arms grumpily. \u201cJennifer\u2019s coming over.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles groans as he pushes himself out of Laura\u2019s chair and ignores the feeling in his chest. \u201cThat\u2019s my cue to leave.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cStiles \u2013\u201d Derek starts.</p>\n<p> Laura interrupts, \u201c But I want to order pizza and watch <i>Masterpiece Theater</i> with you. You\u2019re my friend, Stiles. I say you get to stay, despite what she thinks.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles laughs. \u201cSoon, I promise. Can\u2019t have all the fun tonight, can we?\u201d He pulls Laura into a hug. \u201cWe\u2019ll have all summer. We\u2019ve barely made a dent in the Alistair Cooke years.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to Derek\u2019s game, right?\u201d she asks.</p>\n<p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t miss it for the world.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cFine,\u201d Laura says, falling back into the chair. She turns to Derek and points her finger. \u201cBut if Jennifer touches me, I\u2019m going to slap her.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou let Stiles touch you,\u201d Derek says as he gets up to walk Stiles out.</p>\n<p>\u201cBecause if I didn\u2019t, he\u2019d touch me anyway,\u201d Laura says. \u201cPlus, Stiles is, well\u2026Stiles.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBye, Laura,\u201d Stiles says, and he pushes gently on Cora\u2019s feet hanging over the edge of the couch as he passes. \u201cBye goober. See you tomorrow at lunch.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLater.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek and Stiles walk to the door in silence. When they\u2019re out on the porch, Derek\u2019s eyebrows are knit together when he says, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to leave, you know.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI know.\u201d Stiles gives him a small smile. \u201cBut she is your girlfriend.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek\u2019s brows draw tighter. \u201cBut you\u2019re\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat, Derek? What am I?\u201d Stiles asks. His chest aches, because there\u2019s a role Jennifer plays in Derek\u2019s life he will never play, and she will always come before him, at least for now. It\u2019s a painful revelation, but it\u2019s true.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re Stiles,\u201d Derek says helplessly, and he looks so vulnerable in that moment that Stiles almost grabs him and kisses him right there. But instead, he jogs down the steps and over to his house.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Around eleven, Stiles is in bed watching Netflix when he sees Derek\u2019s light come on. He gets up to close the curtains because watching Derek and Jennifer is <i>not</i> on his to-do list. But when he gets to the window, he finds Derek waiting on him. Stiles waves.</p>\n<p><i>You okay?</i> Stiles writes.</p>\n<p>\n<i>Nervous about tomorrow. Tell me I won\u2019t play badly.</i>\n</p>\n<p>Stiles pulls his chair over to the window and writes, <i>You\u2019ve never played badly a day in your life.</i></p>\n<p>Derek smiles. <i>My biggest fan,</i> he scribbles.</p>\n<p><i>I expect you to sign my rookie card for free.</i> After Derek reads that, Stiles erases it and writes, <i>I plan to retire on what I\u2019ll make off selling it.</i></p>\n<p>Derek laughs. <i>You\u2019d sell it?</i></p>\n<p>\n<i>Hell yeah!</i>\n</p>\n<p>Derek\u2019s face falls as he writes, <i>I really am nervous.</i></p>\n<p>Stiles tosses the whiteboard to the floor beside him. He grabs his cell phone and dials Derek. Derek looks around in confusion when his phone starts ringing, and he crosses to his dresser. </p>\n<p>\u201cWhiteboard too much for you?\u201d Derek asks as he sits on the edge of his bed.</p>\n<p>\u201cI had too much to say,\u201d Stiles says. \u201cYou have no clue how hard it is for me to condense things for that thing. I never say even a tenth of what I want to say.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek grins. \u201cYou mean, I\u2019ve been missing that much Stiles for the past few years?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cConsider yourself lucky,\u201d Stiles jokes. \u201cDo you remember the first night we used the boards?\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek nods. \u201cWe\u2019d been here a week. I wouldn\u2019t talk to you, but you saw me through your window and tried to get my attention, but I ignored you. So, you stood at the window holding a big piece of paper that said hello for probably hours.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt was more like fifteen minutes,\u201d Stiles says with a chuckle.</p>\n<p>\u201cI think it was hours,\u201d Derek argues. He laughs, then sobers and says, \u201cI can\u2019t believe tomorrow is the day.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to do great,\u201d Stiles says. \u201cI know you will.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s so terrifying, to know that my future rests on one game. One mistake and \u2013 \u201c</p>\n<p>\u201cYou can\u2019t think like that,\u201d Stiles says. \u201cThese recruiters aren\u2019t just interested in you because of tomorrow\u2019s game. You\u2019ve impressed them so much so far. Tomorrow will just be the icing on the cake.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFeels like so much more.\u201d Derek picks at something below the windowsill Stiles can\u2019t see, and Stiles just lets him have a few quiet moments. \u201cI told Jennifer about the recruiters tonight.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh? What did she say?\u201d Stiles asks.</p>\n<p>Derek looks up, and even from this distance, Stiles can see the pain on his face. \u201cShe said not to let that get to me, because if we lose, she might lose prom queen.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles has to bite his tongue. Derek doesn\u2019t need to hear the things that Stiles wants to say right now. The game comes first.</p>\n<p>\u201cProm queen, even the school, doesn\u2019t matter right now. The only thing that matters is <i>you</i>, Derek.\u201d Stiles leans forward and puts his palm on the glass. \u201cYou can do this, Derek. You <i>will</i> do this.\u201d Derek nods, and Stiles says, \u201cPlease believe it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI believe <i>you</i>.\u201d</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>As soon as school is over, Stiles sprawls in the backseat of Allison\u2019s car while Lydia takes the front seat for their two hour drive south for the championship game. The game starts at 7:05, so they should arrive in plenty of time for food before they head to the field. Laura is driving Cora and Kira behind them, and even Erica is coming to see Boyd play.</p>\n<p>They end up with tickets along the third base line, which is perfect since that gives them a great vantage point of both Scott and Derek. Stiles sits between Allison and Laura, and when the Beacon Hills Cyclones jog out onto the field, their whole group stands and starts shouting while holding signs. The sign Stiles is holding reads, <b>GO MCCALL AND HALE!!</b> along with their jersey numbers. Scott waves excitedly when he gets to his base, and Allison blows him a kiss. Derek, however, is completely focused on the game, and doesn\u2019t even glance their way.</p>\n<p>Stiles smiles; this is exactly where Derek\u2019s headspace needs to be, in the game and focused on his goal.</p>\n<p>Jennifer and her pep squad start doing a cheer, and the crowd claps enthusiastically as the announcer calls out the Beacon Hills players\u2019 names. Stiles cheers for every single one \u2013 except for Ennis. Then Jackson steps onto the mound and throws the first pitch. It\u2019s a strike.</p>\n<p>Beacon Hills plays one of their best games ever. The other team is obviously good, but the Cyclones dominate through the first four innings. Derek hits a home run and a double, and Stiles and Allison go crazy when Scott hits a single that allows the player on third to run home and score. Even Laura abandons her book and headphones during the last two innings in favor of watching the game.</p>\n<p>Derek hits another home run in the bottom of the sixth, and Stiles grins as he watches the ball soar deep into right field. It\u2019s an amazing feeling, watching Derek circle the bases, his face stoic in concentration. But Stiles can tell, from the set of his shoulders, to the way his feet fall against the dirt, even through his serious baseball player face, Derek is <i>beaming</i>. It\u2019s there in his eyes.</p>\n<p>Stiles can\u2019t take his eyes off Derek, because he makes everything look so effortless out there. This is everything Derek was born to be, he knows it deep in his gut. Derek was made for the diamond, and he\u2019s stunning out there. He belongs on that field.</p>\n<p>Beacon Hills wins 6-2.</p>\n<p>The team lifts Derek and Jackson on their shoulders, because of Derek\u2019s two home runs and Jackson\u2019s fantastic pitching.</p>\n<p>As they carry Derek off the field, Stiles smiles so wide his face hurts.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Stiles is playing video games when he gets a text message after 1 a.m. from Derek. He pauses his game and swipes his phone.</p>\n<p>\n<i>I\u2019m at your back door.</i>\n</p>\n<p>Stiles scrunches his face in confusion as he goes downstairs and opens the door. Derek\u2019s on the other side, still in his baseball uniform, sweaty and covered in dirt. His hair has a flat ring around it from his hat, and Derek\u2019s grinning from ear to ear.</p>\n<p>\u201cI DID IT!\u201d Derek exclaims, lunging forward and picking Stiles up in a bear hug. \u201cI was fucking awesome!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, you were!\u201d Stiles laughs as Derek puts him down. \u201cYou were amazing.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek rubs a hand over his face. \u201cI can\u2019t believe that just happened. It\u2019s just\u2026I kept hearing your voice in my head, telling me I could do it, and I just pushed everything else out.\u201d He laughs. \u201cI just got home. But I had to see you and tell you and thank you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing to thank me for,\u201d Stiles says. \u201cYou\u2019re the one who played the best freaking game ever.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re the reason I played so well. Without you, it never would have happened,\u201d Derek says. He reaches out and grabs Stiles\u2019 arm, and squeezes. \u201cYou\u2019ll never know how much that means to me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles nods, and Derek drops his hand. \u201cI better go get some sleep, I just had to see you before I went to bed.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles smiles as he watches Derek shaking with excitement in front of him, and doesn\u2019t move off the back porch for a long time after Derek\u2019s already returned to his own house.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>The celebration party is at Jackson\u2019s parent\u2019s pool house. They\u2019re out of town and gave him permission to host the party as long as no one got arrested. Stiles is really hoping the cops stay out of it, too, because he does not feel like hiding in bushes tonight or facing the wrath of his father.</p>\n<p>Stiles arrives with Scott and Allison. The party is already in full swing, generic pop music coming from the speakers and the whole place smelling like stale beer.</p>\n<p>\u201cShots?\u201d Scott asks them as they maneuver through the throng of people.</p>\n<p>\u201cShots,\u201d Stiles nods as some guy bumps into him and spills beer on his shoes. \u201cDefinitely need shots to get through tonight.\u201d</p>\n<p>Scott finds a bottle of tequila in the kitchen and brings it along with three shot glasses onto the patio. He starts to set them up when Stiles feels a hand land on his shoulder. The other person spins him around, and he comes face to face with Ennis. </p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019ve <i>got</i> to be fucking kidding me!\u201d Stiles exclaims.</p>\n<p>Ennis pushes Stiles, and he stumbles back into the table, knocking over one of the shot glasses. \u201cWhy is it every time I turn around,\u201d Ennis starts, leaning close into Stiles\u2019 face, \u201cI see your pathetic, ugly face?\u201d Ennis\u2019 eyes are red, and his breath reeks of alcohol. He pushes Stiles again, making Stiles\u2019 back dig painfully into the edge of the table. \u201cWhen are you going to realize that nobody fucking likes you, because you\u2019re an annoying little shit?\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles musters up all his courage, because <i>fuck this asshole</i>, and spits in Ennis\u2019 face. \u201cI don\u2019t care what you think.\u201d</p>\n<p>Everyone around him gasps in shock. He hears the murmurs, <i>Did you see that? Did Stiles just spit on him?</i>, and feels a moment of triumph. Fuck you, Ennis, fuck you and all your bullying, Stiles thinks.</p>\n<p>But his moment of triumph is short-lived. Ennis\u2019 face screws up in a rage, and he literally bares his teeth and growls. Stiles seriously rethinks his decision as Ennis grabs his t-shirt and punches him. And, <i>owowowowowow</i>. A fist to the eye? Fucking hurts.</p>\n<p>\u201cFight!\u201d Stiles hears from somewhere beside him. Because Stiles has no shame, he has his hands raised over his face defensively, trying to ward off any further attack. His eye is already throbbing, and he\u2019s pretty sure it\u2019s swelling up because he\u2019s having difficulty opening it. He knows that if he tried to retaliate, he\u2019d probably just break his hand on Ennis\u2019 face if he even connected with it in the first place.</p>\n<p>Through his fingers, Stiles sees Ennis rear back, and he braces for the next punch. But it never comes. Hesitantly, Stiles peeks out from behind his fingers and sees Derek standing between him and Ennis.</p>\n<p>\u201cHale, why am I not surprised?\u201d Ennis flexes his fingers, and Stiles sees Derek\u2019s posture shift. \u201cSaving your little boyfriend again?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFuck off, Ennis,\u201d Derek barks. \u201cIf you so much as look at Stiles again, I\u2019ll break your fucking nose.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019m so scared of you, Hale. I\u2019ll just beat the shit out of both of you, and then you\u2019ll match!\u201d Ennis laughs, and Stiles\u2019 eyes grow wide as Derek yells and runs at Ennis, kneeing him in the gut.</p>\n<p>The two boys start fighting furiously, and Stiles doesn\u2019t know whether or not to jump in and try to pull Derek away from Ennis or to run away before one of them accidentally kills him. He\u2019s saved from needing to choose when Boyd and the twins rush up and pull the two boys apart.</p>\n<p>Ennis\u2019 face is bleeding in multiple places, and Derek\u2019s got a busted lip and bloody nose. Ennis spits blood on the ground.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s it, Hale,\u201d he says. \u201cYou don\u2019t know what you just did. You don\u2019t know who you\u2019re messing with! You\u2019ll be a nobody.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek snorts, but then grimaces. \u201cYou know what? Fuck you. You\u2019re nothing but a piece of shit. There\u2019s only a few weeks of school left. What the <i>fuck</i> do I care if you hate me? I should\u2019ve broken your nose years ago.\u201d</p>\n<p>With that, Derek spins around and walks away. </p>\n<p>When he passes Stiles, he reaches out and pulls Stiles along with him. Stiles wordlessly follows. When they get to the front of the guest house, Derek swears. Stiles just stares at him, open-mouthed. </p>\n<p>\u201cYou broke his nose,\u201d Stiles finally murmurs as Derek lifts up his t-shirt and wipes his bleeding nose. \u201cYou broke Ennis\u2019 nose for me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe deserved it, the fucking prick.\u201d Derek steps towards Stiles and gingerly takes his chin in his hands. He tilts Stiles\u2019 head and frowns. He touches the tender skin around Stiles\u2019 eye gently. \u201cYou\u2019re gonna have a black eye.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cReally?\u201d Stiles sighs. \u201cI feel like I should be happier about this, my first black eye and all.\u201d Derek smiles, and despite the blood and the light bruising, he still makes Stiles\u2019 insides warm. </p>\n<p>\u201cStiles, oh my god, are you okay?\u201d Scott yells as he runs up to them with Allison. \u201cDude, Ennis is so fucking pissed, but Lydia made Jackson kick him out! And Derek, you\u2019re like a rock star!\u201d Then Scott turns to Stiles while Allison hands Derek a wad of tissue. \u201cMan, are you okay?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFine,\u201d Stiles sighs. \u201cJust a bit of wounded pride. Oh, and a black eye.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cReally?\u201d Scott grins. \u201cThat\u2019s so awesome!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cScott!\u201d Allison exclaims. </p>\n<p>\u201cIt would be awesome if it didn\u2019t hurt like a mother,\u201d Stiles groans.</p>\n<p>\u201cI need to get you home,\u201d Derek says, staring at Stiles\u2019 eye.</p>\n<p>\u201cDude, not to say anything against your awesome show of masculine dominance back there, but you look a little rougher than I do. At least I\u2019m not bleeding.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek shrugs. \u201cIt\u2019ll heal. I\u2019ll barely be bruised in the morning. We need to get something cold on that eye.\u201d He grimaces. \u201cYour dad is going to be so pissed at me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDude, my dad is going to be pissed at <i>me</i>,\u201d Stiles groans.</p>\n<p>\u201cI can take him home,\u201d Scott offers.</p>\n<p>\u201cNah, enjoy the party,\u201d Derek says with a smile. He holds out his hand, and he and Scott do their not-so-secret baseball handshake. </p>\n<p>Scott turns to Stiles. \u201cBut\u2026tequila shots.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles gives Scott a loose hug. \u201cSoon, man. We\u2019ve got all summer to lie around drunkenly and play video games.\u201d</p>\n<p>Scott gives him a goofy grin. \u201cYeah.\u201d</p>\n<p>Allison waves as she drags Scott back to the party, and Stiles walks behind Derek down the street to his car. Once they\u2019re inside, Stiles lets out a shaky sigh. Derek immediately reaches out and covers his arm with his hand.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re safe,\u201d Derek says quietly. \u201cHe\u2019s not going to touch you again.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI know,\u201d Stiles says. </p>\n<p>\u201cStiles, I\u2019m so sorry,\u201d Derek says. \u201cI should never have let things get this far out of control.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDerek, it\u2019s not your fault,\u201d Stiles says with a smile, but it turns into a grimace because smiling freaking hurts. Derek extends his hand but then changes his mind and returns it to his leg. </p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, it is,\u201d Derek says. \u201cBut I swear to you, it won\u2019t happen again. I will break every single one of his fingers if he lays another hand on you.\u201d Derek\u2019s looking at Stiles so intently that he has to look away. This night is just too overwhelming.</p>\n<p>Derek has just put the key in the ignition when his cell phone starts ringing. Derek groans, pulls it out of his pocket, and looks at it. He drops it in the console without answering it.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s Jennifer.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going to answer it?\u201d Stiles asks.</p>\n<p>Derek shakes his head. \u201cI know what she\u2019s going to say. Something tells me I\u2019ll be single and friendless by the morning.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNot friendless,\u201d Stiles says.</p>\n<p>Derek looks over at him as he cranks the car. \u201cNot friendless.\u201d He grins, his lip splitting anew. \u201cYou know, despite what just happened, last night was still the greatest night of my life.\u201d Derek starts driving. \u201cI just wish you hadn\u2019t gotten hurt.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019ll heal, and the fight will be forgotten,\u201d Stiles says. \u201cLast night, you\u2019ll have forever.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cThanks,\u201d Derek whispers a few moments later. </p>\n<p>Stiles nods. \u201cIt\u2019s what I\u2019m here for.\u201d</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>School doesn\u2019t change much, at least not for Stiles. But Derek, well. Jennifer breaks up with him, and all of her crew stops talking to him. Stiles expects Derek to start sitting with them at lunch because Cora and Boyd are at the table, but on Monday, Derek skips lunch altogether. And does the same thing for the next two days.</p>\n<p>At work on Wednesday afternoon, Isaac steps beside him with an armful of CDs. \u201cNice shiner.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019m real street now,\u201d Stiles replies sarcastically.</p>\n<p> \u201cI heard about Derek,\u201d he says. \u201cThe fight and the breakup.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHow?\u201d Stiles asks. Isaac nods towards the front counter, where Erica is leafing through a magazine and blowing bubbles with her gum. \u201cOf course she did.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBe careful,\u201d Isaac says.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that supposed to mean?\u201d Stiles asks defensively.</p>\n<p>\u201cI know Derek\u2019s broken up with his girlfriend, but that doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s going to suddenly ask you out.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles glares at Isaac. \u201cYou can mind your own business. What, are you jealous or something?\u201d</p>\n<p>Isaac rolls his eyes. \u201cNo. Stiles, you\u2019re my friend. And I\u2019ve been there, holding out for the guy who breaks up with his girlfriend and expecting things to be different. I was stupid enough to think sloppy handjobs and me giving a guy a blowjob meant he\u2019d suddenly want to be with me when he broke up with his girlfriend.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDerek and I haven\u2019t done anything like that,\u201d Stiles mutters.</p>\n<p>\u201cI know,\u201d Isaac looks at Stiles in understanding. \u201cI\u2019m not saying Derek is like these guys. I\u2019m just saying be careful, for your own sake. I don\u2019t want you to get hurt anymore than you already have.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles nods, and Isaac squeezes Stiles\u2019 shoulder before he meanders to another section of the store. </p>\n<p>Despite his best efforts, Stiles can\u2019t ignore Isaac\u2019s words. And the most frustrating thing is that they\u2019re things Stiles has already been thinking. Just because Derek broke up with Jennifer doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s suddenly going to start liking guys, and even if he did, why would he want Stiles?</p>\n<p>Stiles is feeling pretty sorry for himself later. Someone enters the shop, but Stiles doesn\u2019t look up from the CDs he\u2019s reorganizing until someone approaches him.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey man,\u201d Scott says. </p>\n<p>\u201cHey,\u201d Stiles replies with a smile.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo, hear me out,\u201d Scott starts with his hands out. \u201cTomorrow is the senior field trip to Funland, which means Allison is going.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, I know.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDerek\u2019s also going to be there, and Jackson.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles sighs and shoots Scott an annoyed look. \u201cDude, I know who all the seniors are.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cRight,\u201d Scott says with a grin. \u201cLet\u2019s skip school and meet them there!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cStiles, it\u2019ll be great! Me and Allison, on roller coasters, sharing cotton candy, holding hands on the carousel,\u201d Scott smiles dreamily. \u201cShe\u2019s gonna graduate in a few weeks. I can\u2019t let her do this without me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGreat, let me tag along and be the third wheel to the Scott-and-Allison show like usual,\u201d Stiles grumbles. It\u2019s unfair, he knows, because he never really feels like the third wheel when he hangs out with them. He\u2019s just in a general bad mood. The black eye hasn\u2019t been helping. It\u2019s just a constant aching reminder of everything.</p>\n<p>\u201cDude, no. Allison and I are going to be a disgustingly happy couple, so you probably don\u2019t want to see that,\u201d Scott says. \u201cYou need to go for Derek.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy would I go for Derek?\u201d Stiles asks. \u201cWe haven\u2019t talked since Saturday night.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAllison said Cora said that Derek is really down about everything. It\u2019s his senior field trip, but except for Boyd and Jackson and Danny, like everyone hates him because of Ennis.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou just named like half the baseball team,\u201d Stiles says. \u201cI\u2019m sure he\u2019ll have plenty of people to hang with.\u201d</p>\n<p>Scott shakes his head. \u201cLydia\u2019s going to be with Jackson, Danny\u2019s got Ethan, and Erica\u2019s meeting Boyd.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles twists around. \u201cYo, Erica?\u201d She looks at him sharply from where she\u2019s helping a customer. \u201cYou going to Boyd\u2019s thing tomorrow?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYep,\u201d she replies, then pops her gum.</p>\n<p>\u201cSee?\u201d Scott says when Stiles turns back to him. \u201cCome on, dude.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cScott, my dad is hella pissed about the black eye,\u201d Stiles says. \u201cHe wanted to arrest Ennis for assault or something. He\u2019ll flip if I ditch.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo he won\u2019t,\u201d Scott says, \u201cNot if it\u2019s to make Derek feel better. Your dad loves Derek. They\u2019re like, baseball buddies.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou know Derek and I aren\u2019t actually a couple,\u201d Stiles frowns. \u201cEveryone\u2019s getting paired off, won\u2019t that be weird?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOhmigod, Stiles,\u201d Scott groans. \u201cGrow some balls! You\u2019ve pined and moped over Derek for like ever, and now he\u2019s single and needs a friend, and you\u2019re going to crap out?\u201d Scott grabs both of Stiles\u2019 arms and shakes him slightly, looking into Stiles\u2019 eyes sternly. \u201cCome on, dude!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFine!\u201d Stiles shouts. \u201cI\u2019ll go.\u201d</p>\n<p>Scott grins. \u201cAwesome. Lydia\u2019ll pick us up in the morning.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re a bad influence,\u201d Stiles says, laughing.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou mean, awesome influence,\u201d Scott replies, grinning widely as he exits the shop.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Funland is half an hour outside Beacon Hills. Lydia and Scott immediately leave Stiles when they enter the park, but Stiles doesn\u2019t want to text Derek. He wants to surprise him. That sounded like such a good idea until Stiles realized just how big Funland actually was.</p>\n<p>Stiles wanders around aimlessly for awhile, trying to spot Derek. He catches sight of Jennifer, Kali, Ennis, and Aiden and promptly turns the corner, following a different path. Stiles\u2019 phone buzzes, and he opens the text from Scott.</p>\n<p>\n<i>Derek spotted. Slushie stand, north end.</i>\n</p>\n<p>Stiles taps out a quick thanks to Scott before making his way towards the north part of the park. Luckily, Derek is still by the slushie stand, sitting alone at a table, playing a PSP. Stiles sneaks up on him, then stands behind him and puts his hands over Derek\u2019s eyes. Derek tenses, and Stiles leans by his ear and whispers, \u201cGuess who?\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek immediately relaxes as he twists in his seat. Stiles drops his hands, and Derek smiles up at him, surprised but pleased to see him. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles shrugs. \u201cScott and Lydia came, so I decided to tag along.\u201d He bumps Derek\u2019s shoulder lightly as he sits down. \u201cFigured someone might like some company.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek keeps smiling at Stiles, looking at him like he\u2019s amazed he\u2019s there. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles steals his slushie and takes a long sip from it. \u201cYou\u2019re buying me a funnel cake later.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDeal.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles leans over and looks down at the screen on the PSP. \u201cWhat are you playing?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMy baseball game,\u201d Derek says, turning the game off. \u201cNot important. So, what do you want to do?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDude, it\u2019s your senior day,\u201d Stiles says, standing up. \u201cYou choose.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, I don\u2019t like rollercoasters, so \u2013 \u201c</p>\n<p>\u201cSo, that\u2019s totally what we\u2019re going to do,\u201d Stiles declares, grabbing Derek\u2019s arm and dragging him along.</p>\n<p>\u201cWait, no, Stiles, seriously, I hate heights.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDerek, I\u2019m aware of that,\u201d Stiles says. \u201cBut this is a perfect time to do something that frightens you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI feel like I\u2019ve been doing that already,\u201d Derek mutters.</p>\n<p>\u201cThen, you\u2019re already in the habit!\u201d Stiles grins. \u201cI won\u2019t make you get on the scariest rollercoaster. Just something mid-sized.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNot the Goliath?\u201d Derek asks.</p>\n<p>Stiles shakes his head. \u201cI\u2019m trying to push you to do something out of your comfort zone, not traumatize you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles leads them through the park, towards the line for the Scream Machine. Derek looks at it nervously, but swallows and squares his shoulders.</p>\n<p>When they\u2019re seated in the car with the seatbelts on and bar secure, Derek starts to look unsure. \u201cThis is like the adult version of the kid coaster,\u201d Stiles tells him.</p>\n<p>\u201cThanks, that makes me feel so much better. I\u2019m terrified of a kid rollercoaster.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s fun, I swear.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIf I die, I\u2019m going to kill you,\u201d Derek says. Stiles rolls his eyes. </p>\n<p>Derek yelps when the rollercoaster jerks to a start, and Stiles laughs at him. It\u2019s kind of hilarious to see Derek, who is always so sure and confident and brave, reduced to terror over the lamest rollercoaster in the whole park. Derek is okay through the first hill, and the second, but by the third, when the drops get more dramatic and the coaster picks up speed, Derek starts screaming and reaches over to grab Stiles\u2019 hand in a crushing grip. Stiles doesn\u2019t let go.</p>\n<p>When the ride is finally over, Derek just sits there, staring straight ahead, still gripping Stiles\u2019 hand. </p>\n<p>\u201cYou okay, big guy?\u201d Stiles asks. He squeezes Derek\u2019s hand.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat was terrifying,\u201d Derek says, turning towards Stiles with wide eyes. He\u2019s pale and clammy. Stiles just throws his head back and laughs.</p>\n<p>\u201cCome on, scaredy cat,\u201d Stiles tugs on his hand as he unhooks the bar and seat belts. \u201cHow about that funnel cake now?\u201d Derek nods, but doesn\u2019t let go of Stiles\u2019 hand until they have completely exited the ride and are back on the ground.</p>\n<p>But they don\u2019t get funnel cake yet. Stiles gets distracted by a guy making balloon animals, so he forces Derek to wait until the guy makes Derek one. Derek gets frustrated when Stiles won\u2019t tell when what he requested, and when the guy hands Stiles the black balloon animal, Stiles hands it to Derek.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt looks like a dog,\u201d Derek says, holding it carefully.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s a wolf,\u201d Stiles says. \u201cBecause you love wolves.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek looks up at him in wonder. \u201cYou remember that?\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles nods. \u201cDude, I remember everything.\u201d He taps the side of his forehead, and Derek looks back at the balloon with a soft smile on his face.</p>\n<p>They almost cross paths with Jennifer, but Derek steers them away because Stiles was paying more attention to the kid\u2019s log train than where he was going.</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you miss her?\u201d Stiles asks as they walk down a shaded lane towards one of the water rides.</p>\n<p>Derek doesn\u2019t answer right away. \u201cYou\u2019d think I would, but I don\u2019t,\u201d he finally says. \u201cI thought I\u2019d be more shattered, because I thought I loved her and we were having sex, but\u2026\u201d Derek shakes his head. \u201cIt felt like a relief when she said it was over. Like I could relax now, instead of worrying about whether or not Jennifer would get mad at me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m still sorry,\u201d Stiles says.</p>\n<p> \u201cShe\u2019s really not a bad person,\u201d Derek says. \u201cI guess in some weird way I loved her, or maybe just cared about her, but I was never <i>in</i> love with her.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHow do you know the difference?\u201d Stiles asks.</p>\n<p>Derek shrugs and looks at him. \u201cYou just do.\u201d Stiles nods, and Derek says, \u201cShe deserves someone whose interests are more aligned with hers. Someone who can love her and be there for her like she needs.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s not you?\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek looks at Stiles, and shakes his head. \u201cNo, not anymore.\u201d Stiles blushes and looks down. \u201cI\u2019m not sure we were ever really on the same page.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy did you date her?\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek answers simply, \u201cI liked her.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles convinces Derek to ride a few other rides, and they find Cora and Kira together on the haunted ride. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d Derek asks.</p>\n<p>\u201cEveryone else ditched,\u201d Cora says, \u201cKira and I weren\u2019t going to be the only losers left at school.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles laughs, and Cora taps the balloon Derek\u2019s still holding. \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cA wolf,\u201d Derek grins. \u201cStiles gave it to me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe did?\u201d Cora asks, raising an eyebrow at Stiles. \u201cThat was nice.\u201d </p>\n<p>Stiles glares at her, and says, \u201cHmm, fancy seeing you and Kira here today.\u201d Cora blushes, but then she winks. </p>\n<p>Between the three of them, they convince Derek to ride a few of the less intense rides, but then Cora and Kira depart to ride the scary rollercoasters, and Stiles hangs back with Derek.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou can go with them,\u201d Derek says. \u201cI can stand at the bottom and watch.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNah, no fun if you\u2019re not there screaming like a baby beside me,\u201d Stiles says. Derek grunts unhappily. \u201cBesides, you still owe me funnel cake.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek buys them a funnel cake, two hotdogs, and two sodas, and carries them to the table Stiles is sitting at. Stiles shakes his head when he sees the tray Derek sits down. \u201cDude, I said buy me a funnel cake, not lunch.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it,\u201d Derek says. \u201cYou needed something more than funnel cake for lunch.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHow much was it? I\u2019ll give you half.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNonsense,\u201d Derek says, picking up his hotdog. \u201cI wanted to get it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles wonders if Derek realizes just how much this feels like a date.</p>\n<p>After they demolish their hotdogs, they start in on the funnel cake. Stiles tears off pieces of it, not caring that he\u2019s getting powdered sugar all over him. \u201cSo good,\u201d Stiles moans around a mouthful.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt is pretty tasty,\u201d Derek concedes, licking sugar from his fingers. Stiles tries not to stare, but it\u2019s hard not to watch his pink tongue circling his fingers, then his lips surrounding them as he sucks. That should be disgusting, not insanely hot, Stiles thinks.</p>\n<p>\u201cUC Irvine called,\u201d Derek says a few moments later. \u201cThey wanna meet with me Saturday morning.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles grins and slaps Derek on the arm, leaving remnants of powdered sugar. \u201cDerek, that\u2019s awesome!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI have to drive down there tomorrow, after school so I\u2019ll be ready for the interview early Saturday morning.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCool.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you want to come with me?\u201d Derek asks shyly. Stiles pauses, funnel cake halfway to his mouth. Derek wants him to go with him. On his college visit. Over night.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy me?\u201d he finally asks, dropping the uneaten piece of cake back onto the plate.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re the only one who gets it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles feels something burst in his chest. \u201cOf course, I\u2019ll come.\u201d Derek\u2019s smile lights up his whole face.</p>\n<p>After they finish the funnel cake, Stiles holds his belly and groans. \u201cToo much sugar and grease, but so good.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek laughs. Then, he extends his hand and Stiles holds his breath as Derek drags his thumb along his cheek, then across his chin. His thumb lightly brushes Stiles\u2019 lower lip. \u201cYou,\u201d Derek pauses and clears his throat, \u201cYou had some sugar.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek drops his hand and turns away, his cheeks pink. Stiles tingles all over.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>After school the next day, Stiles and the sheriff walk next door, where Derek\u2019s tossing his overnight bag in the trunk of his car. The sheriff asks Derek for a few more details while Stiles puts his bag next to Derek\u2019s, then Stiles runs inside to pee before they get on the road. </p>\n<p>He\u2019s grabbing a soda from the fridge when Cora comes up behind him. \u201cYou\u2019re all he\u2019s talked about for days, you know,\u201d she says. Stiles spins around, flailing. Cora rolls her eyes. \u201cLook, Stiles, I\u2019ve been watching you two for awhile now. Derek doesn\u2019t realize he has feelings for you, or if he does, he doesn\u2019t realize what they mean.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what \u2013 \u201c</p>\n<p>\u201cStiles, he broke a dude\u2019s nose for you,\u201d Cora says. \u201cAnd he broke up with his girlfriend. Fuck, he remembers your favorite flavor of sucker. Derek\u2019s been falling for you for awhile, he just doesn\u2019t realize it, because my brother is an oblivious idiot.\u201d She puts her hand on his shoulder. \u201cHurt him, and I\u2019ll give you worse than a black eye.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019d never do anything to hurt Derek,\u201d Stiles replies seriously.</p>\n<p>\u201cI know,\u201d Cora says. \u201cJust be patient with him. He\u2019ll figure it out eventually.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat if you\u2019re wrong?\u201d Stiles asks. \u201cCora, I can\u2019t get my hopes up.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not wrong.\u201d She punches his arm lightly and then disappears upstairs.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna give you a black eye if you\u2019re wrong!\u201d Stiles yells lamely up the stairs.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy are you threatening my sister?\u201d Derek asks, yanking the refrigerator door open and grabbing a bottle of water.</p>\n<p>Stiles covers it up awkwardly. \u201cJust, you know, Cora\u2026stuff.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek lifts a dubious eyebrow but doesn\u2019t push it. Stiles breathes a sigh of relief as he follows Derek out to the car.</p>\n<p>Derek\u2019s quiet on the way out of town, which Stiles can work with. He\u2019s never had any problem filling pockets of silence, but the longer they drive, the further Derek draws away. Stiles wonders if it\u2019s him, if Derek\u2019s regretting asking him along, but deep down he knows that\u2019s not it. He\u2019s pretty sure it\u2019s not even nerves from the upcoming interview \u2013 after Derek\u2019s performance at the championship game, all the recruiters will be racing to have Derek on their team.</p>\n<p>Stiles turns and studies Derek as discreetly as possible, which means not discreetly at all. Derek doesn\u2019t even notice, and if he does, he doesn\u2019t care. He stares straight ahead and just drives. Stiles takes in the clenched muscles in his jaw, his rigid posture as he grips the steering wheel tightly. Stiles also draws his eyes over the dark stubble dusting Derek\u2019s jaw, the way his biceps swell from beneath his t-shirt, the way his lashes flutter when he blinks.</p>\n<p>Stiles doesn\u2019t like that Derek is hurting, especially over those assholes. But Stiles knows they were Derek\u2019s friends, and Derek cared for Jennifer, even if none of them are nice people.</p>\n<p>Stiles grabs the cord and hooks up Derek\u2019s iPod. He scans through Derek\u2019s music, shaking his head in disbelief the entire time. \u201cSeriously, dude, this is the saddest collection of music ever.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, sorry it\u2019s not something straight out of Pitchfork\u2019s top 100,\u201d Derek says.</p>\n<p>Stiles looks over at him in pleased surprised. \u201cDropping Pitchfork like you\u2019re some sort of music snob. Nice,\u201d Stiles grins. </p>\n<p>\u201cI do listen when you and Laura talk,\u201d Derek says. \u201cSometimes.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat is this?\u201d he asks, naming off a few throwaway titles from recent pop charts. \u201cWhy the hell do you have those on your iPod?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThey\u2019re good songs,\u201d Derek says. \u201cI run to them.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLet me guess, Ye Olde Alpha Pack listens to this drivel.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, all the time. I really couldn\u2019t understand,\u201d Derek shakes his head. \u201cIt\u2019s good for a workout, but after awhile, all the songs sound exactly the same.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThank you!\u201d Stiles exclaims. \u201cAt least they didn\u2019t suck your soul out through their bad music! It\u2019s all the same beat over and over again in different songs.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I kept trying to tell them, but they didn\u2019t listen,\u201d Derek says. \u201cThey told me my music was for grandpas and sucked.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhile I think you might want to try something from this century,\u201d Stiles says, scrolling until he finds a song he wants to hear, \u201cI\u2019ve always liked your taste.\u201d Stiles hits play and turns up the volume. When Derek recognizes the song, he groans.</p>\n<p>\u201cI hate this song.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDude, it\u2019s on your iPod.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou probably put it there,\u201d Derek says.</p>\n<p>Stiles thinks, and shakes his head. \u201cI don\u2019t think I did.\u201d He starts spelling <i>S-A-F-T\u2026.dance\u2026</i> along with the song. \u201cI think this is an appropriate song for the occasion,\u201d Stiles says as he starts doing a dumb dance in the front seat. </p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re an idiot,\u201d Derek says, but there\u2019s a smile around his lips.</p>\n<p>\u201c<i>We can dance if we want to,</i>\u201d Stiles starts singing, \u201c<i>We can leave your friends behind\u2026</i>\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re so annoying,\u201d Derek says, trying to keep a straight face. </p>\n<p>\u201cLook, I\u2019m cheering you up.\u201d Stiles pokes Derek\u2019s cheek where a smile is forming. <i>\u201dWe can go where we want to, A place where they will never find, and we can act like we come from out of this world, leave the real one far behind\u2026</i>\u201d Stiles grabs Derek\u2019s hand, \u201cCome on! <i>We can dance!</i>\u201d Stiles starts doing a poor imitation of the robot to the electronic beeps in the song. Derek starts laughing.</p>\n<p>\u201cSuch an idiot,\u201d he says fondly.</p>\n<p>\u201cSee?\u201d Stiles says, still dancing in his seat. \u201cIt\u2019s literally impossible to not be happy during \u2018The Safety Dance,\u2019 no matter how lame this song is.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFine, you made your point,\u201d Derek says, visibly relaxing. \u201cCan we please listen to something else?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want to finish \u2018The Safety Dance\u2019?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles continues scrolling through Derek\u2019s iPod, until he comes to one of Derek\u2019s favorite songs. He hits play, and as soon as the first notes float from the speakers, Derek smiles.</p>\n<p>\u201cI love this song,\u201d Derek says as Toto\u2019s \u201cAfrica\u201d plays. </p>\n<p>\u201cI know,\u201d Stiles says. Stiles knows this is one of Derek\u2019s favorite songs, because it reminds him of his mother. Stiles knows it was one of Talia\u2019s favorite songs, and she used to sing this to Derek when he was a kid. Stiles knows that one of Derek\u2019s last memories of his mother is singing this song with her in the car on his way to school. Stiles knows just how much this song means to him.</p>\n<p>Derek softly sings the words, and Stiles smiles and sings along to the chorus despite the fact that he kinda hates this song. But Derek loves it so much, it\u2019s actually hard to hate it in the moment.</p>\n<p>\u201c<i>It\u2019s gonna take a lot to drag me away from you</i>,\u201d Stiles and Derek belt at the top of their lungs. \u201c<i>There\u2019s nothing that a hundred men or more could ever dooooo, I bless the rains down in Africa\u2026I bless the rains down in Africaaaaaaaaa,\u201d</i> Derek sings while Stiles sings along to the background in a falsetto, \u201c<i>I bless the rains!</i>\u201d</p>\n<p>After the song ends, Derek starts talking, and Stiles figures mission accomplished.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>When Stiles enters the hotel room, he looks around, his eyes falling on the one double bed. He hadn\u2019t thought about that, sharing a bed with Derek. Sure, he\u2019s shared a bed with Derek before, but it was different. Cora, Laura, or Scott was always there, but now, it\u2019s just them. And things are so different between them.</p>\n<p>Stiles just acts nonchalantly about it, dropping his bag on the floor before running and jumping on the bed. Derek shakes his head as he sets his back carefully against the wall. They bring take out Chinese back to the room, and eat it while watching <i>Epic Homes</i> because there\u2019s nothing else on the television.</p>\n<p>Later, Derek is sitting in one of the chairs, watching a baseball game on television in his pajama pants and a wife beater. Stiles has changed into a t-shirt and boxers, and is leaning against the pillows propped against the headboard, finishing up the portrait of Allison. He needs to finish Allison\u2019s gift so he can finish Derek\u2019s, which he\u2019s only about halfway through.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s going to be fine,\u201d Stiles says without looking up from where he\u2019s shading Allison\u2019s eyes. Derek hasn\u2019t spoken in almost two hours, and he\u2019s drawing further and further in on himself. It has been so long since Stiles has spent long periods of time with Derek that he forgot how distant and quiet he could be when he\u2019s not forcing himself to socialize at school.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe interview tomorrow,\u201d Stiles supplies. </p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not worried about that,\u201d Derek says lowly.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re lying,\u201d Stiles says without looking up from his pencil. \u201cYou only get like this when something really important is on your mind, and I doubt the Ennis and Jennifer stuff at school warrants this.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s scary how well you can read me sometimes,\u201d Derek says, running a hand over his hair. \u201cYou\u2019re more perceptive than Laura or Cora.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThey know you, too,\u201d Stiles says. \u201cThey just aren\u2019t as pushy as I am.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat if I say the wrong thing? Or mess up the interview?\u201d Derek asks. \u201cI\u2019m not good with words or people.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re better than you think,\u201d Stiles says. \u201cLook how popular you are. You didn\u2019t get that way from being a sullen, quiet asshole.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNot popular anymore,\u201d Derek says. \u201cIt\u2019s all an act anyway.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI know,\u201d Stiles says. \u201cSo, act tomorrow in the interview. Same principle.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek groans as he moves from the chair to the bed, dropping face first on the mattress. Stiles holds his pencil away from the page as he bounces a few times.</p>\n<p>\u201cThanks for putting up with me and listening to my whining,\u201d Derek mumbles against the bedspread. Stiles reaches out and ruffles Derek\u2019s hair. </p>\n<p>After a few minutes, Derek rolls onto his side and pushes himself up to look over Stiles\u2019 shoulder. \u201cIt looks just like her,\u201d Derek says, staring down at the portrait as he sits up straighter. Stiles moves the sketchpad over a bit so Derek can get a better angle. \u201cIt\u2019s beautiful.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not much,\u201d Stiles says.</p>\n<p>Derek reaches out and touches one of Allison\u2019s curls, then her fingers pushing her hair behind her ear. \u201cStiles, the detail in this is amazing. I didn\u2019t realize how good you were.\u201d Derek drags his fingers across the lines, and Stiles just watches him. He\u2019s leaning into Stiles\u2019 space, so close that Derek\u2019s shoulder is pressed against Stiles\u2019 chest, and each of Stiles\u2019 breaths cause Derek\u2019s hair to gently flutter.</p>\n<p>Stiles opens his mouth to speak, but he finds he has no words. Derek looks up, and they\u2019re so close, faces only a few inches apart. Stiles wants to make the words come out, to deflect this entire situation, but then Derek\u2019s lips are on his, and Stiles melts against his mouth.</p>\n<p>Derek\u2019s lips are soft and kind of chapped, and Derek\u2019s fingers feel calloused and rough where they curl around the back of Stiles\u2019 neck. Stiles\u2019 head is buzzing, making him dizzy with emotion. The kiss is light, hesitant almost, just a gentle press that has Stiles afraid to move, to even breathe, in case Derek suddenly disappears. But Derek\u2019s mouth hasn\u2019t pulled away, in fact, Derek is pressing closer into Stiles and kissing him harder. <i>I\u2019m being kissed ohmigod Derek is kissing me,</i> he thinks.</p>\n<p>But before Stiles can convince his body and brain to catch up, Derek pulls away and rests his forehead against Stiles\u2019, breathing heavily with his eyes closed. Stiles feels every deep exhale against his lips, a light feathery sensation that sends chills all down his spine.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve thought about doing that for awhile,\u201d Derek whispers. \u201cI never thought I\u2019d actually do it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles has his hand pressed against Derek\u2019s chest, flexing his fingers against his skin and barely registers what Derek\u2019s saying. \u201cWait, what?\u201d he finally catches on. He leans back and looks at Derek in shock. Derek\u2019s face is open and vulnerable, like he\u2019s scared Stiles is going to run away and reject him. \u201cYou thought about kissing me?\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek nods. \u201cIs that weird? Did I make things weird?\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles sucks in his lower lip, shaking his head adamantly. \u201cNope, no. Zero weirdness here.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek chuckles lightly, and he tightens his hand around Stiles\u2019 neck before pulling him in for another kiss.</p>\n<p>Kissing Derek is <i>nothing</i> like kissing Isaac was. Both boys are good in their own right, but kissing Derek is possibly the greatest thing Stiles has ever done. Every nerve in his body is on fire, and he can barely think. And all from a kiss. This time, it doesn\u2019t take long before Stiles has his arms wrapped around Derek\u2019s shoulders with his hands raking through Derek\u2019s hair. Stiles pulls away momentarily because he\u2019s distracted by just how soft the strands feel underneath his fingertips, and he looks over Derek\u2019s shoulder where his hand is brushing through Derek\u2019s hair over and over. Derek kisses along Stiles\u2019 cheek and chin before covering his mouth again.</p>\n<p>The moment Derek\u2019s tongue slides inside Stiles\u2019 mouth the first time, Stiles feels like his stomach is doing back flips. Derek\u2019s tongue is warm and slightly squishy against his own, and he puts a bit of tentative pressure against it. Derek seems to like that, because he responds enthusiastically, his tongue moving deeper and more urgently inside Stiles\u2019 mouth.</p>\n<p>Stiles grips the front of Derek\u2019s t-shirt and tugs him down onto the bed, pulling Derek on top of him. As Stiles hits the mattress, Derek holds himself up on his arms, separating their lips. Stiles grips Derek\u2019s shoulders and tries to pull him down again. \u201cMore kissy, don\u2019t stop the kissing.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek smiles and trails his fingers across Stiles\u2019 forehead. \u201cYou\u2019re incredible, do you know that?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDid you get hit in the head with a baseball?\u201d Stiles asks. \u201cBecause that\u2019s really the only explanation for your behavior.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek huffs in exasperation. \u201cWhy do you always criticize yourself?\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles shrugs. \u201cEveryone else seems to.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek leans down and presses his lips right against Stiles\u2019, and mumbles, \u201cEveryone else is wrong.\u201d Stiles wraps his arms around Derek tightly and hugs him close. </p>\n<p>They make out for over an hour. Stiles had fun the other night, but this\u2026kissing Derek like this is unlike anything Stiles could have imagined. His entire body is tingling, his heart racing and his body thrumming with unspent energy. By the time they start to slow down, Stiles\u2019 lips are sore and both boys are panting.</p>\n<p>\u201cWow,\u201d Derek says, nuzzling into the crook of Stiles\u2019 neck to lick and nip.</p>\n<p>\u201cReally?\u201d Stiles asks, hands drawing up and down Derek\u2019s back.</p>\n<p>Derek bites down on his neck hard, and then soothes it with his tongue. \u201cYes.\u201d</p>\n<p>They end up curled together, the television\u2019s volume on low while they talk. Stiles is amazed that this feels no different than other late-night conversations they have had where they shared things easier said in the dark. Stiles remembers the night he told Derek he was bisexual and worried Derek would stop being his friend, and the night Derek told him he\u2019d lost his virginity. It was on a night like this Stiles talked to Derek about his mother, and Derek talked about his parents. Lying and talking like this didn\u2019t feel so different from nights up on Stiles\u2019 roof, sprawled on Derek\u2019s sofa, or lying on their backs in Derek\u2019s backyard. </p>\n<p>Well, except for the whole Derek-having-his-arms-around-Stiles thing. That is new, but Stiles is okay with that. Especially if Derek continued to drag his nose along Stiles\u2019 hairline and behind his ear.</p>\n<p>When Derek turns the television to some comedy show, Stiles feels himself drifting to sleep. \u201cAm I losing you?\u201d Derek whispers against Stiles\u2019 ear.</p>\n<p>\u201cMmhmm,\u201d Stiles mumbles, starting to roll off Derek. \u201cI\u2019ll go to my side, I promise.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek just tightens his arms around Stiles. \u201cNo. I like you right here,\u201d he says.</p>\n<p>Stiles settles back against Derek\u2019s chest, and angles his head to kiss the underside of Derek\u2019s chin. \u201cYou\u2019re going to do great tomorrow,\u201d Stiles says. \u201cNo worrying.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGood night, Stiles,\u201d Derek says, running his hand soothingly along Stiles\u2019 arm.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p> Stiles wakes to the sounds of Derek getting ready. He blinks awake and sees Derek combing his hair. A tray filled with breakfast food sits on the small table. Stiles sits up and reaches for the bagel already smeared with the Stiles-appropriate level of cream cheese. He takes a bite and hums contently.</p>\n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s time for you to take a shower before we leave,\u201d Derek says as he sits in the chair and starts eating his cereal. \u201cI\u2019ll put everything in the car and check out.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles nods numbly. His brain is still asleep, and he needs caffeine. After his shower, they leave for UC Irvine. Derek looks very grown up and professional in his dress shirt and slacks, so different than in his usual t-shirt and gym shorts. But Stiles can\u2019t help but think how handsome he looks, and how good the lavender shirt that Cora no doubt helped him pick out looks with his dark hair. Derek\u2019s quiet, and Stiles is both half-asleep and nervous. It\u2019s too early to think about what happened the night before now that they were outside the safety of the hotel room. </p>\n<p>\u201cGood luck,\u201d Stiles says, giving Derek\u2019s shoulder a supportive squeeze as he sits in the car in front of the building. \u201cDon\u2019t forget, you\u2019re awesome, and you\u2019re an even more awesome baseball player.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek nods, gives Stiles a nervous smile, and then exits the car. Stiles watches as Derek crosses the street, self-consciously messing with his dress shirt and hair. Stiles\u2019 heart is pounding in his chest with second-hand nerves. He knows what this interview means, what rides on this. </p>\n<p>It takes five minutes before Stiles is out of the car, walking down the street a few blocks to the coffee shop they passed. As he stands in line, he looks around at all the college students, with their books and coffees and general college coolness. He frowns as he watches a couple sipping drinks and sharing a muffin. What if Derek goes to college and doesn\u2019t want anything to do with him? It\u2019s happened before; Derek came to high school, and they drifted away for awhile. What if that happens again? What if the college-high school gap is too wide to cross?</p>\n<p>After Stiles receives his coffee, he returns slowly to the car and decides not to worry about that yet. He and Derek aren\u2019t dating or anything else yet. They made out once. Stiles knows from experience that doesn\u2019t mean anything.</p>\n<p>But this whole situation feels like it means everything.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Stiles has dozed off when Derek returns to the car. Stiles looks up at him groggily, and Derek\u2019s beaming at him, his smile so wide it\u2019s almost blinding. Stiles immediately sits up straight and grins, too.</p>\n<p>\u201cThey loved me!\u201d Derek exclaims. \u201cThe coach said he was impressed with my game at the state championship, and that coupled with my overall performance means he wants me to play for them!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDerek, that\u2019s amazing!\u201d Stiles exclaims, lunging forward and wrapping his arms around Derek\u2019s shoulders. They pull apart awkwardly, Derek blushing and Stiles looking out the windshield as he returns to his seat. \u201cSo, does that mean you\u2019ll be accepting their offer?\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek nods. \u201cThey have to send me some paperwork in the mail to fill out, but I\u2019m officially the new second baseman for UC Irvine!\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles feels so proud he thinks his heart might burst out of his chest.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>They don\u2019t talk about what happened on the way home, but it doesn\u2019t feel weird. They talk comfortably the entire ride, and when they pull into Derek\u2019s driveway, Laura and Cora come rushing out of the house screaming, \u201cDid you get it?\u201d and so Stiles is forgotten as Derek\u2019s sisters scream and hug him in their excitement.</p>\n<p>At school on Monday morning, Stiles pulls Scott into his Jeep, giving an apologetic smile to Allison, Lydia, and Kira. </p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d Scott asks. \u201cDid something happen on your trip with Derek? Something happened, didn\u2019t it? I can see it on your face.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh god, really?\u201d Stiles exclaims, yanking the rearview mirror towards him so he can check his face. He had made extra sure Derek hadn\u2019t left any hickeys when he\u2019d gotten home, but maybe he missed something.</p>\n<p>\u201cDude, something <i>did</i> happen! What? Are you two together?\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles shakes his head. \u201cWe kissed. Well, he kissed me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Scott\u2019s eyes grow really large, his mouth hanging open slightly. \u201cDid you two do it?\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles looks at Scott like he can\u2019t believe he just asked that question. \u201cNo, we didn\u2019t <i>do it</i>.\u201d He scoffs and shakes his head. \u201cIt\u2019s not like that. I mean, I sure hope it gets like that soon because I need Derek to sex me up so much right now \u2013 \u201c</p>\n<p>\u201cTMI, dude,\u201d Scott interjects.</p>\n<p>Stiles glares at him. \u201cOh, is that right Mr. \u2018let me list every single one of Allison\u2019s erogenous zones and describe in detail her perfect vagina.\u2019 That\u2019s not TMI? I never needed to know that much about Allison\u2019s lady parts.\u201d</p>\n<p>Scott blushes a deep red. \u201cShut up,\u201d he mumbles. \u201cAnd never tell Allison what you know.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDude, I\u2019d like to keep my balls.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo, you only kissed?\u201d Scott asks.</p>\n<p>Stiles nods, and can\u2019t help the smile that spreads across his face. \u201cYeah. And then we kinda cuddled and talked and watched TV.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWow, that\u2019s major,\u201d Scott says. \u201cSo, are you two a thing?\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles shrugs. \u201cWe haven\u2019t talked since we got home Saturday morning.\u201d</p>\n<p>Scott smiles in encouragement. \u201cI\u2019m sure everything will work out!\u201d Stiles appreciates Scott\u2019s support, because he\u2019s not feeling so good himself.</p>\n<p>At lunch, Derek still doesn\u2019t show up. Stiles turns to Boyd. \u201cSo.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not telling you where Derek is,\u201d Boyd says. </p>\n<p>Stiles glares, offended. \u201cI wasn\u2019t going to ask about Derek.\u201d Boyd just blinks at him. \u201cI was going to ask about how you and Erica are. You know, making conversation and\u2026stuff.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou don\u2019t care about me and Erica, so stop asking things that aren\u2019t your business,\u201d Boyd replies.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat stings Boyd. I thought we were friends,\u201d Stiles says. \u201cAre you taking her to prom?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles smiles and says sarcastically, \u201cI bet she\u2019ll love that. She always talks about how stupid high school institutions like prom are.\u201d</p>\n<p>Boyd\u2019s expression doesn\u2019t change and Cora snorts beside him, so Stiles glares at her too. \u201cI\u2019m not telling you either,\u201d she says.</p>\n<p>Stiles looks between the two, frowning. \u201cAre you two like in this together? It\u2019s not like Derek\u2019s on some super secret mission. Unless he suddenly became a spy without my knowledge.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou two have to work out your own issues,\u201d Boyd says, \u201cand keep me out of them.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles contemplates texting Derek, but he\u2019s not sure what he would text. <i>Do you like me? Circle yes or no</i>? Or something else equally as lame? So, he decides against texting.</p>\n<p>Stiles finally sees Derek later that night, when he glimpses Derek\u2019s light on. He goes over to the window and waves when Derek notices him. Stiles picks up the white board and writes on it.</p>\n<p>\n<i>Are we going to talk about it?</i>\n</p>\n<p>The look on Derek\u2019s face is unreadable as he picks up his whiteboard and writes, <i>I\u2019m so confused.</i></p>\n<p>Something in Stiles breaks, but he swallows it down, instead nodding and scribbling a response. </p>\n<p>\n<i>You know where to find me when you figure it out.</i>\n</p>\n<p>Then he closes his curtains.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>They\u2019re campaigning on Thursday afternoon, handing out fliers with Lydia\u2019s smiling face on them to anyone who passes by.</p>\n<p>\u201cRemember to vote Lydia Martin for prom queen tomorrow morning!\u201d Stiles calls out as he hands fliers to two girls.</p>\n<p>\u201cCan\u2019t we just stuff the ballot box?\u201d Cora says. \u201cOr threaten people? It\u2019s so much easier than this.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you implying that the only way I can win is by stuffing a ballot box?\u201d Lydia snaps. \u201cLook, Cora. I don\u2019t need your negative attitude. You can just leave if it\u2019s inconveniencing you that much!\u201d Lydia points with one hand, the other on her hip.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhoa, don\u2019t get your overpriced panties in a twist, Lydia,\u201d Cora says. \u201cNot what I meant, geez, calm down.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe last thing I need is for my campaign team to lose hope on the eve of my election!\u201d she screeches. \u201cJennifer has already had her pep squad doing little cheers around the school telling people to vote for her and not for me, and I have put a lot of time into this,\u201d she continues, her voice increasing in volume with each word, \u201cAnd I will not lose!\u201d </p>\n<p>In that moment, Stiles is terrified of her. Lydia has this wild, crazy look in her eyes, and everyone at the table is kind of staring at her.</p>\n<p>Someone walks by, and like she has flipped a switch, Lydia smiles at the person and says, \u201cVote for the true Beacon Hills queen! Vote Lydia Martin!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re scary,\u201d Stiles mumbles as Lydia leans against the table. </p>\n<p>\u201cThis is just really stressful, Stiles,\u201d Lydia says. \u201cThis would be so much easier if Jennifer was still going to prom alone.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWho\u2019d she find to take her?\u201d Allison asks.</p>\n<p>\u201cWho do you <i>think</i>?\u201d Lydia huffs. \u201cDerek.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWait, what?\u201d Stiles asks at the same time Cora exclaims, \u201cDerek?\u201d</p>\n<p>Lydia hands out a few fliers as she explains, \u201cApparently, they were seen talking this morning, and by fifth period, everyone was saying that Derek\u2019s taking Jennifer to prom.\u201d</p>\n<p>Scott looks over at Stiles in confusion, and even Cora gives him a look that makes him wonder just how much she knows about what happened between him and Derek. Stiles laughs it off and says to Cora, \u201cSo, would you break my arm if I asked you to an anti-prom movie tomorrow night?\u201d</p>\n<p>Cora gives Stiles an apologetic look. \u201cUm, I\u2019m actually going to prom.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to prom?\u201d Lydia exclaims. Cora nods. \u201cWith who?\u201d</p>\n<p>Cora glances at Kira and blushes. Kira says, \u201cWith me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles grins, and Lydia looks between them in confusion. \u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p>\n<p>Kira grabs Cora\u2019s hand and says, \u201cWe\u2019re kind of dating.\u201d</p>\n<p>Everyone congratulates them and starts asking them tons of questions, and while Stiles is happy for his friends, he can\u2019t help but feel like his world is crumbling around him.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Stiles is somewhere between angry and understanding. The conversation he had with Isaac keeps replaying in his head. <i>Kissing doesn\u2019t mean we have to date.</i> </p>\n<p>Just because he and Derek made out doesn\u2019t mean Stiles should expect anything from Derek. People like Derek and Jennifer break up and get back together all the time. It really shouldn\u2019t surprise Stiles.</p>\n<p>But Stiles is still hurting, his chest aching every time he thinks about it. He feels rejected, angry, and <i>so so stupid</i>. </p>\n<p>Thursday night, he opens his sketchpad and tears out the portrait he was drawing as Derek\u2019s graduation gift. He almost rips it apart, but he looks at it and thinks about everything Derek means to him. Yes, he\u2019s hurt and angry, but it\u2019s Derek. If things are never going to be the same between them, then the last thing Stiles will do is give him a gift that reflects how much he means to Stiles.</p>\n<p>He starts to sketch.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Stiles votes for Lydia for prom queen during homeroom, and then spends the day sulking. No one notices during their pre-prom excitement, and Stiles is okay with that. He wants to feel sorry for himself in peace, thanks.</p>\n<p>Between fourth and fifth periods, he sees Derek and Jennifer talking in the hallway, and he turns around and walks the other way. That\u2019s the last thing Stiles wants to deal with today.</p>\n<p>The moment he gets home from school, he opens the sketchpad back up and works on finishing Derek\u2019s gift with single-minded determination. He wants it over and done with, because he doesn\u2019t want to have to think about Derek in such a concentrated way for awhile. He finishes it around 9 p.m. and sits back to survey his work.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s a portrait of Derek in his baseball uniform, at the moment just after swinging his bat and hitting the ball. Around the edges, Stiles has decorated it to look like a baseball card.</p>\n<p>At the bottom, in small script, Stiles writes:<br><i>Don\u2019t forget that you are talented.</i><br>\nDon\u2019t forget that you are an amazing baseball player.<br>\nDon\u2019t ever forget that you can do it.<br>\n(and don\u2019t forget about me)</p>\n<p>Satisfied, Stiles packages it up carefully and takes it next door. Laura answers the door wearing a pair of headphones, and looks at him in surprise.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey Stiles,\u201d she says as she tugs the headphones off her head. \u201cDerek and Cora are upstairs. We have pizza, if you\u2019re hungry.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles shakes his head. \u201cI\u2019m not staying. Just give this to Derek for me, okay? It\u2019s his early graduation gift.\u201d</p>\n<p>Laura takes it, then tilts her head. \u201cYou okay?\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles forces a smile. \u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d He waves. \u201cSee you later, Laura.\u201d</p>\n<p>When Stiles is back in his room, he turns on his TV and falls asleep.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Stiles doesn\u2019t go to prom. He makes sure that he is out of the house way before any prom limos and party buses would be coming by to pick up him or Derek. He knows that Scott wouldn\u2019t go to prom without stopping by Stiles\u2019 house just in case, and the last thing Stiles wants to see is Derek walking out of his house wearing his tux and carrying a corsage for Jennifer.</p>\n<p>Instead, he puts on the tuxedo t-shirt he picked up at a thrift store that he originally planned to wear to prom, and leaves on his skateboard. </p>\n<p>He skates around town aimlessly, avoiding all the streets where anyone from school might see him. He wants to be alone and try to keep his mind off the gut wrenching idea of Derek and Jennifer together, dancing and kissing and holding hands under twinkle lights.</p>\n<p>It doesn\u2019t work, but it gives him something to do.</p>\n<p>He skates way into the evening, until the sun has sunk below the horizon. It\u2019s helping to dispel the buzzing in his limbs, and to keep the near crushing weight of hurt and rejection at bay. </p>\n<p>Stiles doesn\u2019t notice the car rolling to a stop beside him, doesn\u2019t look up when it starts driving along with him.</p>\n<p>\u201cStiles.\u201d</p>\n<p>Finally, he looks over, and loses his balance and nearly falls over when he sees Derek behind the wheel of his Camaro. Derek\u2019s dressed in his tuxedo shirt and vest, the tie loose and the first few buttons unbuttoned. </p>\n<p>\u201cGet in,\u201d Derek grunts. He doesn\u2019t look happy.</p>\n<p>\u201cShouldn\u2019t you be at prom with <i>Jennifer</i>?\u201d Stiles asks, not bothering to stop rolling along the sidewalk.</p>\n<p>\u201cStiles, please get in the car.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles hops off his board and grabs it angrily. He shoves it in the backseat before dropping into the passenger\u2019s seat. Derek quickly drives off.</p>\n<p>The car is silent as Derek drives. Stiles doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s doing sitting there, what Derek could possibly want with him. Stiles would say he doesn\u2019t know why he got in the car, but that would be a lie.</p>\n<p>Stiles\u2019 leg is bouncing nervously, and he clamps his hand on his knee to try and still it. \u201cWhy aren\u2019t you at prom?\u201d Stiles tries again.</p>\n<p>\u201cBecause the one person I wanted to be with wasn\u2019t there,\u201d Derek replies.</p>\n<p>Stiles turns and stares at Derek, who looks straight ahead as he drives through the night. His mind is reeling, but his cynical self-preservation keeps him from getting too excited. Derek drives to the park, and Stiles watches in confusion as they drive through until Derek pulls the car next to a baseball field. Derek slams the car to a stop and gets out. </p>\n<p>When Stiles gets out of the car, Derek\u2019s standing on the sidewalk, the glow from a nearby streetlight illuminating him softly. \u201cI didn\u2019t take Jennifer to prom because we were getting back together,\u201d Derek starts. Stiles leans against the side of the car and waits. \u201cI couldn\u2019t let her go to prom alone, not when it meant so much to her. I had promised to be her date, so I called her and told her I\u2019d still be her date if she hadn\u2019t found a replacement, and we talked some things out. But we\u2019re absolutely not back together.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re not?\u201d Stiles asks, something that feels a lot like hope bubbling in his chest. </p>\n<p>Derek shakes his head. \u201cI told her there was someone else.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh.\u201d Stiles chews his lip, watching with a pounding heart as Derek steps closer and closer to him until he\u2019s right in front of him.</p>\n<p>\u201cSee, there is this amazing guy who has been in front of my face the entire time, and I\u2019ve just been too dense to realize it. This amazing guy who is my biggest supporter and always there, despite everything. Who is kind, amazing, smart, talented, and gorgeous. An amazing guy who for graduation made my very own baseball card.\u201d </p>\n<p>Stiles flushes, a violent mix of emotions inside him. \u201cThe guy you\u2019re describing doesn\u2019t exist. He sounds too perfect.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s perfect for me, and he\u2019s standing right in front of me.\u201d Derek reaches out and cups Stiles\u2019 face. \u201cStiles, will go to prom with me?\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles giggles stupidly, but throws his arms around Derek, kissing him hard. Derek slides his arms around Stiles\u2019 waist and holds him tightly. Stiles feels light-headed, like he\u2019s floating on air and the only thing that\u2019s keeping him grounded is Derek\u2019s arms around him. </p>\n<p>\u201cNot confused anymore?\u201d Stiles asks when they part. </p>\n<p>Derek shakes his head with a smile. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have been confused in the first place.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBecause it\u2019s you,\u201d Derek says, dragging his knuckles down Stiles\u2019 cheek. \u201cEverything with you has always been so simple. This was simple, too. I just was too dumb to see it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou could have said something,\u201d Stiles points out. \u201cI\u2019ve been miserable for like a week, thinking you thought it was a mistake.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNothing with you has ever been a mistake.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles leans forward and kisses Derek. \u201cWell, we\u2019re here now, right where we belong. That\u2019s what matters.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re what matters,\u201d Derek says quietly. \u201cIt may have taken me awhile to realize it, but you belong with me.\u201d He kisses Stiles again.</p>\n<p>When Derek pulls away from him, Stiles whines in disappointment. Derek laughs and says, \u201cI\u2019m coming right back,\u201d as he opens the driver\u2019s side door, rolls down the windows, and turns on the radio. Then, he grabs Stiles\u2019 hand and leads him into the parking space beside them. A soft melody floats from the car, and Derek asks, \u201cWill you dance with me?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDerek Hale, you are such a cheeseball,\u201d Stiles says, but he\u2019s smiling widely.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s my senior prom,\u201d Derek says. \u201cI want to dance with my boyfriend.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYour boyfriend?\u201d Stiles stares at him in shock, and Derek looks embarrassed. </p>\n<p>\u201cIs that okay?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you kidding me?\u201d Stiles exclaims. \u201cDerek, I love you, of course it\u2019s okay.\u201d Stiles stares at Derek wide-eyed when he realizes what he let slip. \u201cI mean, I, well, you see \u2013\u201c</p>\n<p>Derek cuts him off with a kiss. \u201cI love you, Stiles.\u201d He looks at him seriously. \u201cI am one hundred percent in love with you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles can\u2019t handle all the emotions he feels inside, so he kisses him again. They fall into a slow dance, more just a shuffling from side to side as they cling to one another, Stiles\u2019 head resting against Derek\u2019s.</p>\n<p>After a few songs, Stiles says, \u201cThat was really nice what you did for Jennifer.\u201d He kisses the side of Derek\u2019s face. \u201cYou\u2019re so kind; it\u2019s one of the things I love about you.\u201d Derek just kisses him in response. \u201cStill could have told me, you know. Or talked to me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI told you I was confused,\u201d Derek says.</p>\n<p>\u201cVia a white board. That doesn\u2019t count.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek sighs in aggravation. \u201cI\u2019m not confused anymore.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGood,\u201d Stiles grins, then kisses Derek. But as Derek slips his tongue into Stiles\u2019 mouth, he gets distracted and pulls back. Derek looks irritated and tries to kiss him again. \u201cWait, who won prom queen?\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek laughs. \u201cLydia.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles throws his head back and laughs. \u201cGood for her.\u201d Derek spins him in a circle.</p>\n<p>They dance away most of the night.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Sunday, Stiles sleeps in past noon. He spends the afternoon with his dad, and the only thing the sheriff says when Stiles tells him that he and Derek are now boyfriends is, \u201cNo more spending the night with each other.\u201d Stiles figures that\u2019s fair.</p>\n<p>After his dad goes to work, Stiles is working on his research paper on <i>The Scarlet Letter</i>when he sees the red laser pointer skitter across his book. He twists around in his desk chair to see Derek standing at his window, holding his whiteboard.</p>\n<p>\n<i>What are you doing?</i>\n</p>\n<p>Stiles grins and writes on his whiteboard, <i>Paper. You could text you know.</i></p>\n<p>Derek frowns and shakes his head as he writes, <i>I like these things. We won\u2019t get to use them much longer.</i></p>\n<p>\n<i>:( Don\u2019t remind me.</i>\n</p>\n<p>\n<i>Can I come over?</i>\n</p>\n<p>Stiles grins. <i>Dad\u2019s not home.</i></p>\n<p>Derek drops his whiteboard and rings his doorbell a minute later. As soon as Stiles has let Derek inside the house and has relocked the door, Derek is immediately on him, kissing him and sliding his hands beneath Stiles\u2019 t-shirt.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhoa, down boy,\u201d Stiles finds himself saying. And honestly, he never thought he\u2019d say those words. Especially to Derek. \u201cWant to maybe wait until we get to my bedroom before you ravage me?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNot really,\u201d Derek murmurs from where he\u2019s sucking gently on Stiles\u2019 neck.</p>\n<p>\u201cStairs,\u201d Stiles says, slithering out of Derek\u2019s arms so he can ascend the stairs. Derek reaches out and grips him by the hips, holding on to him until they\u2019re inside Stiles\u2019 bedroom. Derek wraps himself around Stiles again and walks him backwards until Stiles\u2019 legs bump against his bed. Then Stiles pulls Derek down to the bed with him.</p>\n<p>They start making out again, mouths hot and heavy as their hands start roaming. Stiles feels like he will never get used to this, to the weight of Derek\u2019s body on his, the gentle scrape of Derek\u2019s stubble against his face, the feel of Derek\u2019s hot tongue. And when Derek slides his hands underneath Stiles\u2019 shirt, he moans as it goes straight to his cock. And all Derek did was touch his side.</p>\n<p>Before long, they\u2019ve both got their hands shoved under each other\u2019s shirts, and Stiles shifts, and <i>oh</i>, that is Derek\u2019s hard cock. Brushing up against his hard cock. He releases a muffled moan against Derek\u2019s mouth and rolls his hips, and Derek rolls his in response. They start rutting against one another, Derek\u2019s hard cock rubbing against his own. This, well, Stiles thinks, this is awesome. Derek is on top of him, hips moving in an uncoordinated rhythm to match Stiles\u2019 as they kiss like they\u2019re trying to suck each other\u2019s face off, Derek\u2019s hands sliding beneath his shirt and lightly thumbing his nipples.</p>\n<p>Each of Stiles\u2019 limbs are tingling from the tips of his fingers and toes straight to his core. Something about this feels dirty, getting off from just this, just rubbing against each other until they come. Stiles wants to try everything with Derek, wants everything of Derek stuck inside all of him, but right now this is perfect.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m close,\u201d Derek mumbles against where he\u2019s mouthing at Stiles\u2019 jaw. </p>\n<p>\u201cMe too,\u201d Stiles whispers.</p>\n<p>Derek reaches down between them and cups Stiles through his shorts and starts rubbing along his length, and the feel of Derek\u2019s hand is so great and unexpected that Stiles arches off the bed and comes right then. Derek keeps rubbing him through his orgasm, dropping kisses all over his neck, jaw, and cheeks as Stiles falls back to the bed, Derek\u2019s hand stroking him through aftershocks.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat was so fucking hot,\u201d Derek says, kissing Stiles\u2019 mouth as he starts rubbing himself off on Stiles\u2019 thigh. Stiles can barely move, his entire body turned to jelly; he reaches down and tries to touch Derek like he touched him, but he doesn\u2019t have the energy, so he just runs his hand around the globes of Derek\u2019s ass. </p>\n<p>He feels it the moment Derek comes, his body tensing and Derek grunting through a soft moan. It is quite possibly the hottest sound Stiles has ever heard, and he wants to cause Derek to make it over and over again. Derek\u2019s hips speed up, but then slow as he rides out his orgasm, and soon he kind of just collapses half on top of Stiles.</p>\n<p>Stiles runs his fingers through Derek\u2019s hair lightly, reveling in the warmth and closeness. He just had sex, kinda. He just had an orgasm with the help of another person. And not just any person, but with Derek. Just because he and Derek didn\u2019t do any below the belt touching, nothing was going to take away how awesome that was.</p>\n<p>\u201cI hope that was okay,\u201d Stiles says against Derek\u2019s hair. He closes his eyes and inhales the scent of Derek\u2019s shampoo, then kisses Derek\u2019s forehead.</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course it was,\u201d Derek says. \u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t it be?\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles shrugs. \u201cYou\u2019re used to more than some dry humping, and \u2013 \u201c</p>\n<p>\u201cHey,\u201d Derek says, pushing himself onto his elbows. Stiles\u2019 heart clenches in his chest. Derek\u2019s hair is mussed, his cheeks pink, and his eyes bright. He looks blissed out and happy, and all Stiles can think is <i>I put that look there.</i> </p>\n<p>Derek says, \u201cDon\u2019t ever compare yourself to anyone else.\u201d He leans forward and pecks Stiles on the lips. \u201cWhat I did with her doesn\u2019t even compare to this. So,\u201d he pauses and stares at Stiles like he just can\u2019t get enough of him, \u201cdon\u2019t do it, okay? This is us. Something new, but completely comfortable. And dry humping with you was awesome.\u201d He leans down and hovers just above Stiles\u2019 mouth, \u201cBecause it was with you, and you\u2019re so beautiful when you come.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles blushes and looks away, and Derek forces him to look him in the eye as he kisses him.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Stiles and Derek don\u2019t hide their new relationship from their friends, but they don\u2019t exactly advertise it at school either. They don\u2019t walk down the hallway holding hands, and they don\u2019t act as anything more than friends. Derek only has two weeks until graduation, and after everything that\u2019s happened, Stiles just wants to keep a low profile. </p>\n<p>Stiles spends a lot of time at the Hale\u2019s cuddling with Derek on the couch while watching movies and playing video games with him, Cora, and Laura, and Derek comes over to his house for dinner a few nights. They mostly fool around when the sheriff is at work, because the one time they rubbed off against one another in Derek\u2019s bedroom, Laura and Cora made suggestive comments the rest of the night. </p>\n<p>At school, Derek sits between Stiles and Boyd at lunch, and takes over Stiles\u2019 spot as Kira\u2019s Spades partner. Lydia wears her prom queen crown to school the Monday after prom, but after that, no one really talks about prom queen anymore. It\u2019s all about graduation.</p>\n<p>The last week of school, Stiles is at his locker between classes when Derek runs up to him, nearly vibrating with excitement.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Stiles asks, slamming his locker shut.</p>\n<p>Derek just smiles at him, so happy he can barely form words. \u201c<i>Baseball America</i> named me their High School Player of the Year!\u201d Derek exclaims. </p>\n<p>\u201cOh shit!\u201d Stiles yells as his heart nearly bursts with pride. He knows this is one of the highest honors a high school baseball player could receive, and most of the former recipients have gone on to have major league careers. This is a huge deal. </p>\n<p>Stiles doesn\u2019t know what to say, so he screams in excitement. They\u2019re starting to draw a crowd with their outburst, but Derek ignores that as he lifts Stiles up and twirls him around excitedly. When he lowers him back to the floor, he doesn\u2019t let go as he kisses Stiles deeply. A few people catcall, a few make rude comments, but Stiles tunes it all out.</p>\n<p>Stiles is so happy, he\u2019s pretty sure none of this is real.</p>\n<p>He just keeps reminding himself that it is.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>\n<b>Epilogue</b>\n</p>\n<p>Stiles keeps looking out the window every five minutes. Derek said he would be home at 4:00, and it is already 4:05, and Derek is <i>not home yet.</i></p>\n<p>Stiles is totally not the clingy, crazy boyfriend. Actually, he\u2019s learned over the last few months he\u2019s a pretty chill boyfriend. Things he always thought would make him jealous or crazy don\u2019t bother him with Derek. Maybe that\u2019s because of the way Derek looks at him. Stiles still melts every time Derek looks at him with those eyes of his.</p>\n<p>But Derek has been at baseball camp for six <i>long</i> weeks. And he moves to college in a few weeks, so every minute Derek isn\u2019t home is one he loses with him.</p>\n<p>Finally, around 4:30, Derek\u2019s Camaro pulls in the driveway. Stiles is immediately out of the door and running across their yards. Derek\u2019s barely out of the car before Stiles jumps on him, wrapping his arms and legs around Derek and kissing him.</p>\n<p>\u201cMmm, hello to you, too,\u201d Derek mumbles against Stiles\u2019 mouth, holding him tightly as he kisses him. The kiss is uncoordinated and desperate, but he hasn\u2019t kissed Derek in six weeks, okay? He has needs.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou could at least let him get in the driveway before you climbed him like a tree,\u201d Cora drawls as she comes walking down the front steps.</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you two know the meaning of discretion?\u201d Laura asks. Stiles lets go of Derek long enough to flick her off.</p>\n<p>\u201cNow, girls, leave your brother alone. They\u2019re cute,\u201d Peter says. And that\u2019s Stiles\u2019 cue to let go of Derek and maybe start breathing again.</p>\n<p>\u201cI missed you,\u201d Derek says, kissing Stiles\u2019 temple as he walks around to the trunk of his car.</p>\n<p>After Derek greets his family and they all go out to dinner (Peter\u2019s treat), Stiles and Derek sneak over to Stiles\u2019 house so they can finally be alone. They kiss all the way up the stairs, Derek holding Stiles up each time he stumbles on the steps. When they\u2019re finally in Stiles\u2019 bedroom, they quickly strip off their shirts and fall onto the bed.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re so fit now,\u201d Stiles says, straddling Derek\u2019s lap and running his hands along newly formed muscles and lines. \u201cYou\u2019ve been getting the perfect body, and I\u2019ve been sitting around with Scott eating Cheetos and playing video games.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t see anything wrong with your body.\u201d Derek lifts up and licks a line along Stiles\u2019 sternum, then starts lapping at one of his nipples. Stiles allows his eyes to drift shut as he focuses on Derek\u2019s tongue against him after being without it for so long.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you can have visitors at college,\u201d Stiles says breathlessly, \u201cbecause this whole not seeing you thing sucked. I can\u2019t go through it again.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe talked every night,\u201d Derek says, moving on to Stiles\u2019 other nipple. \u201cAnd video chatted.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNot the same, dude.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek hooks an arm around Stiles\u2019 waist and flips them so Stiles is on his back. He gives Stiles a feral grin before kissing his way down Stiles\u2019 torso. Stiles\u2019 belly quivers with anticipation, all his blood and thoughts going straight to his cock. </p>\n<p>Derek dips his tongue inside Stiles\u2019 bellybutton in teasing little motions, then drags his tongue along the trail of hair disappearing beneath the waist of Stiles\u2019 pants. Stiles watches through heavy-lidded eyes, his entire body tense as Derek looks up at him through his lashes.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re killing me,\u201d Stiles says, voice low and breathy. Derek kisses the dip of Stiles\u2019 hip as he unbuttons his pants, then hooks his thumbs underneath the band of his underwear to pull them off. Stiles is both excited and nervous; before Derek left for summer baseball camp, they had moved from just frottage to handjobs and naked rubbing. But blowjobs were something completely new.</p>\n<p>Stiles watches as Derek studies Stiles\u2019 cock with interest, his hand wrapped around the base. Stiles knows this is one of their shared firsts, and Stiles likes those the best, the things that he and Derek can experience together. </p>\n<p>Derek slides his lips over the head of Stiles\u2019 cock, and Stiles moans at the sensation. It feels nothing like the other things they\u2019ve done, the warmth of Derek\u2019s mouth around his shaft quite possibly the best feeling in the world. Stiles can\u2019t help but reach out and slide his fingers into Derek\u2019s hair, holding him as Derek bobs his head. Each movement is shallow, Derek unable to take Stiles\u2019 full length just yet, but Stiles doesn\u2019t care. He knows they have plenty of time to practice, and right now he\u2019s not sure he could even handle it.</p>\n<p>\u201cDerek,\u201d Stiles moans, his hand tightening as Derek grows more confident. He sucks Stiles harder, his tongue swirling around the crown of Stiles\u2019 cock with every upward thrust. \u201cI\u2019m going to come,\u201d he warns, but Derek just curls his free hand around Stiles\u2019 hip and increases his efforts.</p>\n<p>The sensations build as Stiles gets closer and closer, the pleasure pooling low in his belly until he emits a choked moan and comes in Derek\u2019s mouth. Derek swallows most of it, only a bit spilling over and down his chin. Stiles almost comes again on the spot as he watches a thin line of come dribbling from his mouth.</p>\n<p>He drops back onto the bed, panting heavily as Derek crawls up beside him, wiping his mouth with one of their discarded shirts. Stiles reaches up and pulls him down into a kiss, unable to believe that he\u2019s tasting his own come on Derek\u2019s lips.</p>\n<p>\u201cPlease tell me you didn\u2019t practice that at baseball camp,\u201d Stiles says, and Derek punches him in the arm. \u201cOw! That\u2019s no way to treat your sexed out boyfriend.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHow dare you even imply something like that,\u201d Derek grumps, his eyebrows drawn and unhappy. </p>\n<p>\u201cWas it weird?\u201d Stiles asks. He always asks Derek questions like this, making him compare his experience with women and men. Usually Derek just grunts at him and gets irritated that Stiles is making him compare. It\u2019s no different tonight.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt tasted better than I imagined,\u201d Derek says, his tongue darting out to lick at his lips. \u201cI kinda loved it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI did, too,\u201d Stiles says. \u201cSo, please, feel free to suck my dick anytime you want.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek rolls his eyes and starts back in on attacking Stiles\u2019 mouth.</p>\n<p>Later, after Derek has gone back home, Stiles sees his light on and walks to the window. Derek sees him and smiles. </p>\n<p>Stiles picks up the whiteboard and writes, <i>I\u2019m glad you\u2019re home.</i></p>\n<p>Derek responds, <i>I\u2019m glad I\u2019m home, too.</i></p>\n<p>-fin</p>"
