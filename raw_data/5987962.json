  "text": "<p>The Manor hadn\u2019t changed much since the war. The walks were a little more unkempt, and no one came to answer the front door, so Harry had to go round the house trying doors, all of which refused to open for him. One of them, with a gargoyle holding the knocker in its mouth, scowled and tried to bite his fingers. \u201cMather ith in the workshop,\u201d it hissed at him. Harry turned and spotted a thin line of smoke going up in the back of the property. He had to go through the formal gardens and make it past a hedge gauntlet before he finally found the place, an old stable.</p>\n<p>He pushed the big door open and stepped into the dim dusty space, a cavernous hayloft overhead and empty stalls on either side. There were noises coming from deeper in. His footsteps thudded on the wood planks as he walked around the corner and came into an open space that had probably been a smithy once: there was still an anvil and bellows and a giant furnace full of coals.</p>\n<p>Draco was there, doing something to the innards of an enormous old grandfather clock, its opened-up face like an angry moon and a mouth shut tight. It glared at Harry as he came close. \u201cPotter,\u201d Draco said over his shoulder. \u201cTo what do I owe the pleasure? An accusation of Dark magic practices this time, or is it just another civil suit? You\u2019d think people would have given up by now.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry would\u2019ve given a lot to be here with a writ. He had one last try at convincing himself he didn\u2019t have to do this. Malfoy\u2019s clothes made no concessions to the work: he was wearing a long black leather coat embossed with silver over a white shirt, a full cravat at the neck, and matching boots that came over the knee. He looked like the definition of a dilettante.</p>\n<p>\u201cMaughren Lane said I should come to you,\u201d Harry said reluctantly.</p>\n<p>\u201cMm,\u201d Draco said, without looking round. His hand kept moving: he looked like he was waving the tip of his wand back and forth over a couple of the gears. \u201cIn the habit of taking his advice, are you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo did Philemona, D\u2019Artois, and Borgin.\u201d So had a lot of other people: Harry had gone to lengths before gritting his teeth and coming.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s always nice to have the respect of one\u2019s peers,\u201d Draco said. He made a sudden rapid twisting jerk of his arm, a flash of red light and a bang: Harry\u2019s hand was on his wand, instinctively. Then Draco put down the wand and shut the clock face up again. \u201cNow let\u2019s see,\u201d he said to the clock, which scowled at him, too, but then spun its hands round and round until it hit noon. Suddenly it opened its mouth and a golden bird flew out, singing, flew in a circle round the whole clock, whose eyes followed it, and then darted back inside. The clock shut its mouth, now beaming.</p>\n<p>Draco turned round, wiping his hands clean\u2014on a silk handkerchief\u2014and leaned against the workbench. \u201cAnd what did they say you should see me about?\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry slung down the sack from his shoulder, turned it upside down on the ground and stretched the mouth wide, then pulled it straight up and up and up until the whole iron gate was uncovered, held between its two stone posts. Draco came off the bench and towards it at once, his eyes narrow and glittering, and put his hands on it lightly, going all round, touching the carvings in the posts, running his fingers over the ends of the twisted and bent ironwork. \u201cSeventh century, the Vigilant Smith\u2019s circle for certain, quite possibly by her own hand,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll need to examine the secondary aurae to be certain. Where <em>did</em> you dig this up? Her work doesn\u2019t normally turn up outside Finland, and I follow all the auctions.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt did turn up in Finland. A Dark witch tried to use it in a ritual there on the solstice,\u201d Harry said. \u201cWe\u2019re not sure what she was doing exactly, we think she was trying to open a portal to somewhere\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, \u2018open a portal to somewhere,\u2019\u201d Draco mimicked in an irritating whine. \u201cWhat did you think, she wanted to use it to go on holiday? She was trying to raise the dead, obviously.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat? How do you know that?\u201d Some of the other experts had mentioned the Vigilant Smith before, but none of them had suggested <em>that</em>.</p>\n<p>Draco crooked a finger at the ceiling, and one of the lights high above floated down, shrinking into a tiny blazing-bright ball. He brought it over to the topmost iron bar over the gate. It was bent nearly double and blackened with smoke, but in the bright light Harry could just see there were worn-down runes etched faintly into the metal. \u201cThe Vigilant\u2019s gates go to the land of the dead, Potter. Someone who translated the inscriptions literally would undoubtedly get the incorrect idea that they could bring the dead out of them. It\u2019s just the sort of stupid mistake an incompetent Dark witch would make.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat makes you think she was incompetent?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShe got caught trying, didn\u2019t she?\u201d Draco said. \u201cHow do <em>you</em> come into a Finnish investigation?\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry said slowly, \u201cShe died in the spell she was casting, so they couldn\u2019t question her about what she was doing. But when they went through her things, they found\u2014a lot of stuff of Voldemort\u2019s.\u201d Draco stiffened. \u201cBits of magical things he made, letters he wrote, even an old schoolbook.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo she was trying to bring the Dark Lord back,\u201d Draco said. \u201cPlanning to question him about Dark spells, how he gained power, no doubt. Brilliant. Well, good riddance she\u2019s gone. Pity about the portal, but why do you want me to look at it? I doubt you could use it properly even if it wasn\u2019t a twisted wreck; the rituals have been lost for centuries. Put the thing in a museum and be done with it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe can\u2019t,\u201d Harry said. \u201cThey sent it over to our office to see if we could work out what she was doing, and Hermione took charge of it. She couldn\u2019t tell what the witch was trying to do, but she realized it was a portal, and she was trying to get it open\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPotter, are you working up to telling me Granger actually managed to send herself to the land of the dead?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe need to get her back!\u201d Harry said. \u201cAnd no one can work out how to fix it.\u201d</p>\n<p>#</p>\n<p>Malfoy, the utter bastard, actually laughed at him for a solid minute. \u201cHave you finished?\u201d Harry said tightly.</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course not,\u201d Draco said. \u201cYou can\u2019t expect me not to enjoy this properly. The great hero come begging the pariah\u2019s help, to rescue none other than the pride and joy of the Muggle-borns. It\u2019s more satisfaction than I\u2019ve looked for in years.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou seem to be doing just fine, Malfoy,\u201d Harry said.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019d be amazed at the number of places that won\u2019t take my money these days,\u201d Draco said. \u201cNot to mention I\u2019ve had to sell off half the woods to pay the legal bills\u2014I believe there\u2019s some sort of hideous mass development in the works.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLook, can you fix this thing or not?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCertainly I can fix it,\u201d Draco said, with an airy wave of one hand. \u201cBut it\u2019s going to cost you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry\u2019s breath went out of him in a sudden sharp release, almost dizzying. He hadn\u2019t known until Draco said the words how desperate he\u2019d been to hear them. He\u2019d been in the conference room talking with the head of the Finnish investigation team when he\u2019d heard the bang from down the corridor and gone running through the smoke, shoving past the coughing crowd gathering at Hermione\u2019s door. Her two assistants had staggered out, sooty and eyes running, and they\u2019d gasped out what had happened: the sudden flaring of grey light, the sucking vortex pulling at her\u2014</p>\n<p>He\u2019d gone to every magical artificer in London. None of them had known how to fix it. Borgin had been the first one to come out with Malfoy\u2019s name, tentatively: \u201cI hesitate to mention, Mr. Potter, but\u2014under the circumstances\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Harry had said, staring grimly down at the portal.</p>\n<p>\u201cAn artifact of this age and complexity is rather beyond the usual round,\u201d Borgin had said. \u201cI am afraid there is very little money in repairing such antique things\u2014the contrary, in fact. It can only be a labor of love. Very few people have the opportunity to do enough of it to form what one might call an <em>expertise</em>\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you know someone?\u201d Harry had seized on the opening instantly. Then he hadn\u2019t wanted it, of course, but over the last three weeks he\u2019d tried every reputable craftsman in London, Edinburgh, and Paris, and some others beyond, and after the fifth time someone had half unwillingly said something like, \u201c\u2014of course, it must be admitted that Monsieur Malfoy does have a wide knowledge of older artifacts\u2026\u201d he\u2019d known he wasn\u2019t getting out of coming here. He just hadn\u2019t expected he would get anything he wanted.</p>\n<p>Now he was sorry he hadn\u2019t come sooner. \u201cYes, fine,\u201d he said. \u201cHow much?\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco snorted. \u201cI\u2019m not reduced to <em>penury</em>. I want something considerably beyond money, and I rather think you\u2019re the only one can give it to me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou want the Invisibility Cloak,\u201d Harry said, flatly. He\u2019d half expected as much; it was the only thing he had that Draco could want\u2014</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t be stupid, Potter,\u201d Draco said. \u201cI want my <em>reputation</em> back.\u201d</p>\n<p>#</p>\n<p>Draco ticked off the bizarre demands on his fingers: a meal together somewhere in public, twice a week until the repairs were done. Conspicuous meetings at Harry\u2019s office at various hours of the day, where Harry would make a point of dropping whatever he was working on to meet with Draco. \u201cAnd I want you to get your good friend Arthur Weasley to submit a land-use bill to the Wizengamot, restricting the sale or lease of all territory that has been held continuously by wizards for more than twenty generations only to other wizards, and requiring any building upon that land to pass approval from the Historical Preservation Society,\u201d Draco said. \u201cYou can call it the Preservation of Magical Britain Act or something of the sort.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Harry said, baffled. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not having a Muggle housing estate built on my doorstep,\u201d Draco said. \u201cAnd the bill obviously doesn\u2019t affect anyone but me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHow do I know that\u2019s true?\u201d Harry said suspiciously.</p>\n<p>\u201cBecause that\u2019s the <em>point</em>,\u201d Draco said. \u201cIf Arthur Weasley puts a bill to the Wizengamot, your crew of slavish admirers will hop on board, and if that bill has no effect whatsoever except to prevent the vultures who bought my woods from leveling them and selling them off in parcels, everyone will understand that the Malfoys still have power, after all.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThey\u2019ll know we\u2019re only doing it because we need your help,\u201d Harry said.</p>\n<p>\u201cNobody will care <em>why</em>,\u201d Draco said. \u201cI\u2019ll still have managed to get my worst enemies to read in a bill entirely for my sake. The toadlickers will be delighted to fall back into line after that.\u201d</p>\n<p>It all stank, of course, but when Hermione\u2019s life was on the line, Harry was ready to hold his nose. \u201cBut if you don\u2019t fix it, after all,\u201d Harry said grimly, \u201cyou had better believe I\u2019ll find a way to take it all back.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, I\u2019ll fix it,\u201d Draco said. \u201cHowever, it\u2019s still going to be on <em>your</em> hands to figure out how to use it properly. I told you, the rituals have been lost, and I have not the slightest intention of taking a jaunt to the other side myself.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFine,\u201d Harry said. \u201cI\u2019ll talk to the Finnish wizarding enforcers. They should be able to get me something.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSplendid,\u201d Draco said. \u201cNow run along, Potter, it\u2019s going to take me the rest of the day just to work out what this is going to involve. I\u2019ll see you at my club tomorrow at noon. And <em>don\u2019t</em> be late.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry walked out of the building and then paused, cast a Silencing Spell on his shoes and swung on the Invisibility Cloak\u2014he\u2019d brought it along with him, thinking Malfoy would demand it on the spot before he\u2019d start working. He slipped back into the stable and crept along to the workshop. He half expected to find Malfoy laughing at Harry\u2019s gullibility with one of his Slytherin pals over the Floo.</p>\n<p>The workshop looked like it had been hit by a demented gang of pixies in the three minutes since he\u2019d left. Malfoy was intently dusting the gate with half a dozen different kinds of colored powders out of sacks, and they\u2019d gotten everywhere\u2014all over his cravat and his fancy leather coat. Even his <em>hair</em> was pink and green and yellow with them. He impatiently swiped some dust out of his eyes, smearing more colors across his forehead and his sleeve, and grabbed his wand. \u201cNow we\u2019ll see what you\u2019re made of,\u201d he told the gate, a gleam in his eye. \u201c<em>Incantio Aurelis Revelio!</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>A spark shot from his wand and set off all the powders in a huge explosion of smoke. Harry backed away hastily: he\u2019d be a conspicuous empty space if the clouds hit the cloak. The smoke billowed all around the gate, different layers and colors shimmering, a wild smeary pattern like a child working with finger paints. \u201cAhh, there you are,\u201d Draco said, going up to the whole mess and running his fingers through an odd layer of shimmering green-blue, with the kind of smirk he\u2019d used to wear in first year when he\u2019d just got in some really good tormenting. \u201cI thought it was you.\u201d</p>\n<p>The smoke was drifting over the floors, and Harry had to make a dash for the door.</p>\n<p>#</p>\n<p>Harry arrived for lunch at the Old Whissing club at the stroke of noon, not a moment earlier. He\u2019d never been before: it was a Wizengamot crowd, mainly a lot richer than anyone he knew. He knew Percy still marked his invitations there like counting coup or something. The footman at the door looked surprised to see him, and the butler materialized instantly\u2014Apparition so seamless he didn\u2019t even make a pop\u2014and held his hand out for Harry\u2019s coat. \u201cWelcome to Old Whissing, Mr. Potter. Will you be dining in the main room today?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cEr,\u201d Harry said. \u201cI\u2019m not sure\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco came in through the doors just then. The butler looked over and stiffened. \u201cThere you are, Potter,\u201d Draco said, all genial tones, like they were old friends. \u201cI didn\u2019t keep you waiting long, did I? Hello, Wheedle, how have you been? We\u2019ll take a table for two, in the Oak Gallery.\u201d He swung off his cloak, glittering buttons flashing, and tossed it over the butler\u2019s arm.</p>\n<p>Wheedle looked at Harry and back at Draco. The footman at the door had stepped up behind Draco and had a hand half reaching for his arm, but he was looking at the butler, as if for instructions. Harry didn\u2019t have any idea what was going on, but suddenly Wheedle said, \u201cVery good, Mr. Malfoy,\u201d in firm tones, and handed the coats on to the footman. \u201cIf you will be so good as to follow me.\u201d</p>\n<p>The Oak Gallery was through four sitting rooms and up a staircase, with tables set in alcoves that overlooked the main dining room. Heads turned all over, watching them walk through the club, and more than one person turned round to peer up at their table once they were seated. \u201cWhat was <em>that</em> all about?\u201d Harry said, after they were alone.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe members didn\u2019t like to go so far as a <em>formal</em> blackballing, I dare say,\u201d Draco said, flipping his hand. \u201cToo many of them were a bit vulnerable in their own turn. But I\u2019m sure the senior members had a word with Wheedle, and I would have been quietly encouraged to leave if I\u2019d shown up under more ordinary circumstances.\u201d He threw a brooding look over the room. \u201cAll the clubs in town are waiting to see which one you\u2019ll pick, of course.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to pick any of them,\u201d Harry said. \u201cI don\u2019t want a <em>club</em> where people have to be voted in or something. It\u2019s all a lot of old-fashioned nonsense.\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco rolled his eyes. \u201cPotter, you want to be Minister of Magical Enforcement in three years when Fancieul retires, don\u2019t you? There are seven different wizards and witches we walked past with significant influence over the appointment and confirmation process who would instantly give you their votes if you joined this club. Oh, yes, very sordid,\u201d he sneered at Harry\u2019s expression. \u201cTry not to be stupid. Your disdaining <em>old-fashioned nonsense</em> means none of them know you or have any sense of who you are, other than the dread slayer of the Dark Lord, bringer of light and all that is good, righteous hater of the corrupt and venal\u2014which is <em>not</em> a recommendation. Shall we have the \u201986 Montrachet? I think we shall,\u201d he added, as a waiter appeared.</p>\n<p>Harry had meant to eat quickly and be done with it, but that pretty clearly wasn\u2019t meant to be in the cards when the four-course menu appeared. He would\u2019ve put his foot down, but Draco took the menu out of his hands and handed him a fat scroll instead, which when Harry opened it said <em>Preliminary Notes</em> and had a dozen diagrams of the gate inside, so he didn\u2019t lift his head or even bother to listen as Draco ordered for them both. He didn\u2019t care what the food was: he mostly ate takeaway at his desk for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. There weren\u2019t enough hours in the day, and he didn\u2019t have anyone to eat with anyway, really\u2014he and Hermione had got each other in their respective breakups, and though they did eat together often enough, they just did it at his desk or hers.</p>\n<p>They had used to, anyway. \u201cYou <em>can</em> fix it?\u201d Harry said urgently, finally looking up from the scroll as the first plates were cleared\u2014he\u2019d eaten whatever it was without really noticing, still reading through. He\u2019d vaguely registered the food was good, but it couldn\u2019t match the feeling of going through the notes and starting to believe Malfoy wasn\u2019t lying, and he could fix the thing. Because if he <em>could</em>, he was <em>going to</em>, if Harry had to stand over him and hold a wand to his throat. \u201cHow long will it take?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAt least three months.\u201d \u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>What?</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSorry, did you think this was going to be like mending a broken cauldron?\u201d Malfoy sneered, taking back the scroll and rolling it up again with a flick of his wrist. \u201cMost of the work can only be done on the first night of the new moon, and I\u2019m going to have to forge new iron for the entire gate, <em>with</em> ore extracted from the same place as the original, which is going to be a delight to track down, since the Vigilant Smith used ore from six different mines. If you don\u2019t like it, find someone else. Oh, that\u2019s right, you\u2019ve already tried! Bad luck there.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd what\u2019s happening to Hermione in the meantime?\u201d Harry said through clenched teeth.</p>\n<p>\u201cI haven\u2019t the faintest idea,\u201d Draco said. \u201cProbably she\u2019s talking the dead to death all over again.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI swear, Malfoy, I could just\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco leaned back in his chair and raised the scroll meaningfully between them, inviting Harry to continue with a condescending eyebrow. Harry swallowed the words and glared at him. \u201cYou\u2019re such a bastard.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI realize you\u2019re used to everyone in the wizarding world falling over themselves to demonstrate their adoration, but don\u2019t expect <em>me</em> to fawn over you, Potter,\u201d Draco said. \u201cAhh, the quail. I\u2019ve missed this.\u201d New plates had just appeared in front of them.</p>\n<p>\u201cHow d\u2019you even <em>find</em> all this about the gate?\u201d Harry said, scowling down at the innocent food. \u201cAnd why couldn\u2019t anyone else tell me about it?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cExamining that gate already cost more in Aureal Powders than Borgin and Burkes make in a month,\u201d Draco said. \u201cAnd who wants anything like it? People always want the shiniest new toy, not the old one, particularly your Muggle-loving lot.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy did <em>you</em> learn to do it?\u201d Harry said. \u201cRepairing old clocks and magical antiques\u2014bit of a low hobby for a Malfoy, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco\u2019s face twisted. \u201cThe hours have to be filled somehow,\u201d he said. \u201cThat takes more doing when no one\u2019s inviting you to any of the right parties. Besides, nothing\u2019s <em>low</em> as long as it costs you money to do.\u201d</p>\n<p>They ate in silence for a bit. Harry started out just stabbing his fork at the plate in frustration, but the quail really was good. Then Draco said abruptly, \u201cDid you ever find out how the Death Eaters got into Hogwarts, sixth year?\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry looked up at him. \u201cThe Vanishing Cabinet you fixed.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe only thing that wasn\u2019t nightmarish about that year was actually working on the thing. It was so hard that when I was in the middle of it, I could forget why I was doing it and what was going to happen if I didn\u2019t succeed. Merlin, that still ranks as the worst year of my life,\u201d Draco muttered.</p>\n<p>Harry stared down at his plate, juices pooled red around the bones, and for a moment his stomach turned over, remembering\u2014the spurt of arterial blood, Draco\u2019s terrified face as he\u2019d slipped to the floor, his hands trying uselessly to press at the wounds, the feeling of Dark magic crawling over the back of Harry\u2019s neck. He swallowed, cold, and shook it off. \u201cI\u2019d probably have to go with seventh year, myself,\u201d he said roughly.</p>\n<p>\u201cNot that much to choose from, either one,\u201d Draco agreed, draining his wineglass. \u201cUgh, I need something stronger.\u201d</p>\n<p>He ordered them both a cocktail that came to the table smoking and tasted like a bomb going off. Harry felt a bit woozy after the first swallow, and kept going, gratefully. By the pudding course, he was complaining to Malfoy about the same thing he complained to anyone who\u2019d listen, the do-nothing crowd in the Ministry and how they dug in their heels at every single reform proposal.</p>\n<p>\u201cAll the active-duty Aurors are with me,\u201d Harry said, spilling a little of his drink\u2014it might have been the second one\u2014as he gestured. \u201cBut everyone higher up, it\u2019s ludicrous. I can\u2019t even ask for\u2014for <em>ink pens</em> to be added to the supplies without an argument.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, <em>naturally</em>, Potter,\u201d Draco said, lolling back in his deep chair, waving a hand a little unsteadily with the dregs of his own drink. \u201cEveryone knows you\u2019re a crusader who doesn\u2019t care about your own look-out, much less anyone else\u2019s. Anything you suggest, they can\u2019t trust. Maybe the ink pens are the first step towards the guillotine, they haven\u2019t any idea.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIf only,\u201d Harry muttered.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t any idea how to go on at all as soon as you can\u2019t blast away with your wand, you never have,\u201d Draco said. \u201cYou\u2019d better just marry some pureblood witch from a proper family and let her sort it out for you. It\u2019s just a matter of cornering the right person at tea, saying wistfully how nice it would be to have ink pens, such a convenience, and find a way to make it worth their while to help you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to do that!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThen get used to quills,\u201d Draco said. \u201cAnd most likely dying in disappointment. You\u2019re never going to change anything while sneering at everyone who isn\u2019t up to your standards of heroism.\u201d</p>\n<p>He stood up while Harry was still speechless with indignation\u2014<em>he</em> wasn\u2019t the one who <em>sneered</em> at people!\u2014but there was an old stooped wizard tottering up to the table, in long embroidered red velvet robes and a pointy red hat, leaning on a stick. \u201cHello, Malfoy,\u201d he said, very loudly.</p>\n<p>\u201cHello, Master Gobblegrack. Won\u2019t you sit down, sir?\u201d Draco said.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, no.\u201d He waved Draco away from the chair. \u201cI\u2019m heading to the mediwizards. Not much better than vampires, the lot of them. Good to see you. Heard about your father: condolences. Is your mother well?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, sir, thank you,\u201d Draco said. \u201cShe\u2019s in the South of France. Do you know Harry Potter?\u201d</p>\n<p>The old wizard turned his rheumy eyes on Harry. \u201cWe haven\u2019t met. Could have guessed you, though, boy. You have a look of your grandfather. Good man! Terrible business with your father, terrible. Glad he didn\u2019t live to see it.\u201d The old man wagged his head. \u201cWell, it\u2019s all a long time ago now. A long time ago. But I\u2019m still doddering along.\u201d He reached out with the stick and poked Draco\u2019s arm. \u201cHey? I\u2019m still here. Glad to see you here, too. Don\u2019t let the gnomes nip at your ankles.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t intend to,\u201d Draco said, bowing, and the old man crept along and left them. Harry watched him go, bemused: he\u2019d never really thought about his grandparents\u2014obviously he must have had some, only they seemed to all have disappeared along the way without his ever noticing. He vaguely remembered Aunt Petunia going on obligatory monthly visits to a home somewhere, to her mother, but that had stopped before he was seven years old. The Dursleys had left him with Mrs. Figg when they\u2019d gone to the funeral. It hadn\u2019t occurred to him that of course, he\u2019d had wizard grandparents, too.</p>\n<p>\u201cDid our grandparents know each other, do you think?\u201d Harry said to Draco.</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course they did,\u201d Draco said, dropping himself back into his seat heavily and reclaiming his drink. \u201cWe\u2019ve got photos from your grandparents\u2019 wedding in my house. My grandmother was in the wedding party. We\u2019re third cousins or some such, actually.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s just weird,\u201d Harry said blankly.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s <em>weird</em> is how you\u2019ve deliberately severed all ties to your wizarding relations,\u201d Draco said. \u201cI suppose it comes of being forced to grow up among Muggles.\u201d Then he stared at Harry with a suddenly odd expression.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Harry said.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe did it on purpose, didn\u2019t he,\u201d Draco said. \u201cDumbledore.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Harry said. \u201cThere was a charm on my mother\u2019s blood. As long as I lived in their house\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Draco interrupted. \u201cI mean he left you to the Muggles on purpose. So you wouldn\u2019t know any of your family, anyone who might have intervened in your charming destiny. He really did fatten you like a calf for the slaughter, didn\u2019t he.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t!\u201d Harry said.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll have to learn to think better of my father after all,\u201d Draco mused aloud. \u201cI don\u2019t think he <em>deliberately</em> planned to hand me over to Voldemort\u2019s tender mercies before I had reached the age of majority.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry wanted to have the fight with him, but he couldn\u2019t: it was the fight he\u2019d had with Hermione, a dozen times and more. There was a lump in his throat, hearing it. Not to mention it felt somehow uncomfortably closer to the truth coming out of Draco\u2019s cynical mouth. He went sideways instead, asked Draco what he knew about the Potters, which was a lot: it turned out their families had intermarried several times.</p>\n<p>Draco ended up telling him a raft of maliciously funny family stories from the last three centuries. He\u2019d always had a gift for mockery, and Harry could actually enjoy it when it wasn\u2019t meant to torment anyone. And the thing was, Draco <em>wasn\u2019t</em> fawning over him. Or even just being especially polite. Harry hadn\u2019t realized how used he was to people speaking to him in respectful tones these days, or for that matter how off-putting it was. But you couldn\u2019t make friends with someone calling you Mr. Potter, sir, like <em>he</em> was the doddering elderly wizard. Not that he was going to <em>make friends</em> with Draco, but it made a change.</p>\n<p>Harry went back to the office afterward still tipsy and full of quail and pudding and relief. Three months was too long, but it was better than <em>never</em>, and Draco might really be able to do it. Harry sat down at his desk and put his head in his hands and just breathed for a bit before he got back to work: the first time he\u2019d been able to even look at anything on his desk in the last three weeks.</p>\n<p>He was almost eager for it the second time, later that week: he was hoping for more details about the repair. Draco took him to a posh restaurant down on Sosiet Alley, where the back-and-forth at the front of the house played out again with a similar ending: they got taken to the best table, without even a reservation. A couple of people stopped by to speak to Draco, too, just say hello really, and he looked intensely triumphant by the end.</p>\n<p>\u201cBut why do you even care?\u201d Harry said. \u201cWhat do you want with people who\u2019ve proven they\u2019ll just drop you if you\u2019re not on top?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s like you have this bizarre idea that the only useful people are true friends,\u201d Draco said. \u201cThe head waiter doesn\u2019t have to be my boon companion to give me the table I want. If I relied on true friends, I\u2019d never talk to anyone.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat about all your crowd from school?\u201d Harry said.</p>\n<p>Draco snorted. \u201cWhich of them were you thinking of? The ones who tried to kill me for being an insufficiently enthusiastic Death Eater, the ones who ignored me after the trials started, or the ones who didn\u2019t come to my father\u2019s funeral?\u201d He tossed his napkin down and looked at Harry. \u201cDo you want to come to the Manor and see the progress so far?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Yes</em>,\u201d Harry said instantly.</p>\n<p>The workshop had been tidied back into pristine glory, and not a single tool was off the hook, but the gate was standing in the middle of the floor, and faintly glowing magical lines in different colors were floating inside the ironwork. \u201cWhat are all these?\u201d Harry said. \u201cWhat are the colors for?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBecause I like a festive atmosphere,\u201d Draco said. \u201cHonestly, Potter, you can <em>see</em> that the ironwork\u2019s all hideously deformed, I trust? Vision working properly? Fine, now do tell me how <em>you</em> would position the bars.\u201d He pointed to a yellow arc and a green arc, both within inches of each other and a badly-kinked bar that crossed them both. \u201cEither path would fit the sockets for this one.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry stared at it in dismay, understanding the problem. And\u2014 \u201cThere\u2019s fifty bars in the thing!\u201d Nearly all of them had <em>some</em> damage.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy, who knew, Gryffindors can count,\u201d Draco said mockingly. \u201cFortunately, there are <em>some </em>constraints: the paths have to relate to one another properly. The yellow path here can\u2019t go with the green path over here,\u201d and he touched the arc for a different bar, next to the kinked one. \u201cIt can only go with this yellow path.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo wait, <em>every color</em> is\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnother set of possibilities,\u201d Draco said. \u201cAs I find the options, I can throw some of them away until I\u2019ve found the one solution that makes them all work.\u201d</p>\n<p>There were at least twenty different colors so far at a glance. \u201cWhat if there\u2019s more than one?\u201d Harry said.</p>\n<p>\u201cThen I take my best guess and you see if it works or if it blows you up,\u201d Draco said. \u201cIf it does neither, I\u2019ll try the next one. What did you think? It\u2019s not as though there\u2019s anyone to check the answers with.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cRight,\u201d Harry said, grimly.</p>\n<p>\u201cAssuming you do manage to put together the ritual, that is,\u201d Draco added.</p>\n<p>Harry let his hands drop. \u201cI\u2019ve got half a dozen possible fragments from the Helsinki Archmagisterium. I\u2019m going to try to put them together into some sort of order.\u201d It was the sort of thing that Hermione did as easily as breathing. He\u2019d just have to do his best. He barely knew where to start\u2014he\u2019d been spending all his nights staring at them, trying to piece out connections. He hadn\u2019t made a lot of progress. He sighed. \u201cThanks for letting me see it,\u201d he said, turning round.</p>\n<p>Draco was leaning against the enormous forge on one elbow, arm on his hip. He looked at Harry with that considering expression again, then said, \u201cYou did realize that \u2018come to the Manor and see my work\u2019 was a euphemism, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry discovered that he <em>had</em> realized, actually, even if he had successfully pretended to himself he hadn\u2019t. He swallowed, his mouth suddenly dry. \u201cYes,\u201d he said. \u201cI did.\u201d</p>\n<p>They had sex in Draco\u2019s bedroom. Harry spent most of the time wondering what he was doing, until it became inescapably clear, and then he could relax because it was too late to change his mind. The room was a vast sprawl with a four poster bed hung with medieval drapery and full of odd magical knickknacks, some of them wandering around on their own. Draco undressed carelessly, tossing clothes over a screen. Harry unbuttoned his own robes, staring down at the small squirming glossy brown thing inching its way determinedly along the windowsill.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s a querrel\u2014old spying tool from the Third Goblin Wars,\u201d Draco said. \u201cGoblins don\u2019t see things that move like earthworms for some peculiar reason.\u201d</p>\n<p>He went on telling Harry about the expensive repair involved to the thing while he stripped the robes down off him from behind and then put his hand on the back of Harry\u2019s neck and slid his thumb along the line of his throat in an experimental way that made Harry gasp and shudder. \u201cOh,\u201d Draco murmured, like he\u2019d figured something out, and started kissing his neck while he worked on Harry\u2019s belt, and eventually Harry ended up leaning on the windowsill wide-eyed and gulping for air as Draco fucked him ruthlessly for twenty very solid, very good minutes, before dragging him stumbling over to the bed to finish off.</p>\n<p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t have guessed at you taking it,\u201d Draco said conversationally, stretching next to him like a self-satisfied cat, licking his lips. \u201cBut you do it magnificently. Do you want to stay the night? We can go again in the morning.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, okay,\u201d Harry said, after a momentary inward struggle. He wouldn\u2019t really have guessed at himself taking it either, much less from Draco Malfoy, but he wasn\u2019t going to argue with results. It had been\u2014a really long time.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd next time I\u2019m taking you dancing,\u201d Draco added. \u201cThe Prophet is sure to land us on the society pages for that.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry opened his eyes for that and glared at him. \u201cI\u2019m still here, actually!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou already know I\u2019m using you,\u201d Draco said. \u201cBesides, what did you have in mind? I\u2019m certainly not going to be your dirty secret.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry groaned.</p>\n<p>Getting laid the next morning went a ways to reconcile him to his fate, though. He was barely awake when Draco pushed him onto his stomach and worked into him with a maddening and fantastic leisurely pace. \u201cYes, that\u2019s right,\u201d he purred, as Harry gasped and squirmed, trying to get taken over the edge. \u201cThat\u2019s right, show me just how badly you want it, and maybe I\u2019ll give it to you,\u201d which shouldn\u2019t have been a turn-on, and yet.</p>\n<p>Harry went to the office still flushed and feeling\u2014brighter, more alive. Also vaguely ashamed of himself, because it seemed wrong to jump into bed with Malfoy at all, much less to have enjoyed it this much. But the last time Harry\u2019d had a go, with a perfectly nice and friendly witch he\u2019d met at the pub, he\u2019d just felt guilty and rotten the entire time. He\u2019d already half known in the back of his head he wasn\u2019t going to get around to making a second date. And before that\u2014well, he hadn\u2019t been able to give Ginny the kind of time and attention she wanted and deserved either, had he. At least with Malfoy, he didn\u2019t need to feel bad for not calling the next day.</p>\n<p>There was just so much to <em>do</em>. Voldemort was gone, but half of the hidebound rules still needed to go. There were a thousand things that needed doing, fixing, changing, and ten thousand obstructions in the way. So many restrictions supposedly for the protection of wizards were really an excuse to let whoever was in power point the Aurors at whoever they wanted. The people in power liked it that way, and they didn\u2019t want to shift.</p>\n<p>So it wasn\u2019t enough for him to say, right, he\u2019d do his part, everyone else could pitch in their fair share. The wizard who\u2019d killed Voldemort could force through the necessary changes no one else could, get things moving forward faster than anyone else who stuck their neck out.</p>\n<p>And he wasn\u2019t being some sort of martyr, either, he <em>wanted</em> to do the work. It was more satisfying than anything else he could do, as hard and frustrating as it was. He was making things <em>better</em>, making the wizarding world open its doors and let the light into the dark corners. Only\u2014without Ginny pulling him away once in a while, he\u2019d ended up going too far\u2014at his desk till all hours, barely seeing anyone outside of the office. It had been ages since he\u2019d so much as gone out for a coffee, much less a two-shag\u2026well, <em>date</em> didn\u2019t seem like the right word for what he\u2019d done with Draco, but he hadn\u2019t had anything closer in the last three years.</p>\n<p>Of course that meant the Daily Prophet probably <em>was</em> going to be all over it, if Draco had meant it about the dancing.</p>\n<p>#</p>\n<p>Draco had meant it about the dancing. Harry wasn\u2019t much of a dancer, even aside from the anticipation of making a public spectacle of himself, so he went in braced for a night of tedium and embarrassment alleviated only by strong drink. Then halfway round the floor the first time, people not even trying to hide their stares, Draco leaned in. \u201cHave you ever been had in a carriage before?\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry twitched. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s a particular challenge, if the winds are as high as they are tonight,\u201d Draco said. He whirled them into a turn. He\u2019d insisted on leading, and Harry hadn\u2019t planned to argue, he hadn\u2019t the faintest idea how to do it, except he was reasonably sure you weren\u2019t supposed to put your thigh hard between your partner\u2019s and turn him so he ended up sliding against it, only his body wasn\u2019t complaining, and then Draco was whispering, \u201cNot slipping out, you realize,\u201d in his ear, and Harry had a horribly vivid image of lying back across Draco\u2019s enormous velvet-plush carriage seat with Draco gripping onto him and working to stay <em>inside</em>, the whole thing rocking under them\u2014</p>\n<p>\u201cRight,\u201d Harry said, strangled. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut we\u2019ve only just started to have fun,\u201d Draco said, which was when Harry realized he was in fact in for a night of <em>malicious torment</em>, and strong drink wasn\u2019t going to do anything whatsoever to help.</p>\n<p>Although thankfully that proved wrong, because after the second drink Harry lost his temper and forgot to worry about the <em>Prophet</em> or anyone else watching and dragged Draco bodily out of the club behind him. He all but shoved Draco into the carriage and climbed on top of him, tearing away his clothes, and banged him right there in the back seat. It <em>was</em> a challenge, but Harry still kept in flying trim, and he\u2019d always been good at balancing. Draco took just as well as he gave, too, laughing breathless and mocking underneath him.</p>\n<p>That was some consolation when the Daily Prophet featured a full spread of them in the society pages the next morning. They even had quotes from a couple of unnamed sources saying that Draco was consulting with the Aurors on confidential matters, thanks to his particular expertise with ancient magical artifacts, and romance had bloomed. \u201cWhere did they even get this stuff from?\u201d Harry said incredulous.</p>\n<p>\u201cI think that bit about romance blooming must have come from Blaise, that\u2019s his idea of a turn of phrase,\u201d Draco said, buttering a crumpet: they were at breakfast in his bedroom. \u201cHe called me the other day after seeing me on Sosiet Alley, and I dropped a hint or two. The other one was me, of course, by anonymous owl.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry wanted to be angry, but Draco was so smug, which really wasn\u2019t attractive except for how it put him right into the mood, and when he tossed the paper aside and crooked a finger and said, \u201cCome here, Potter, I\u2019m going to suck your cock before you go to work,\u201d Harry really couldn\u2019t think of anything to say but \u201cYes, please.\u201d</p>\n<p>Although he reconsidered as soon as he got to the office and the Howler in his office started yelling at him in Ron\u2019s voice to <em>CALL ME THE INSTANT YOU GET THIS HARRY WHATEVER MALFOY\u2019S GOT ON YOU I\u2019LL HELP YOU WHY DIDN\u2019T YOU CALL ME IN THE FIRST PLACE</em> and then went into a repeating flashing circus routine of <em>CALL ME CALL ME CALL ME!</em> until Harry managed to get the Floo open over the noise.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s not blackmailing me into it!\u201d Harry yelled into the fire.</p>\n<p>\u201cHermione wouldn\u2019t want you to do this to yourself, Harry!\u201d Ron said.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHas he Imperiused you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo! Ron, look\u2014\u201d Harry stopped and blasted the Howler with an Incinerating Hex; it scorched up with one final rising yelp of <em>call meeee!</em></p>\n<p>\u201cRight, I\u2019m coming over there with George and Percy and a sack of bezoars,\u201d Ron said. \u201cWe\u2019ll get you straightened out, Harry, don\u2019t you fret.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, for\u2014Ron, I swear I\u2019ll revoke your clearance for the building,\u201d Harry said. \u201cI\u2019m <em>fine</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGive me one convincing reason you\u2019d start shagging Draco Malfoy of your own free will!\u201d</p>\n<p><em>It seemed like a good idea at the time</em>, except that wasn\u2019t true, it had seemed like a bad idea at the time, only the sort of bad idea that ended in orgasms. \u201cWould you accept a moment of weakness?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t explain why you\u2019d <em>keep on!</em>\u201d Ron said.</p>\n<p>Harry muttered, \u201cHe\u2019s brilliant in bed.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo he\u2019s drugging you,\u201d Ron said morbidly. \u201cBet it\u2019s <em>Eromotentica</em>. Are you feeling feverish yet?\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry finally had to turn the fire extinguisher on the Floo to get rid of him, and he left the Auror Department that night in the Invisibility Cloak\u2014just as well, since Ron really <em>was</em> lying in wait for him with George, and a Snatching Sack at the ready.</p>\n<p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe you!\u201d Harry said, taking the cloak off after he\u2019d yanked the Sack away from them and fired it straight into the trash devourer\u2019s pen.</p>\n<p>\u201cSorry, Harry,\u201d George said cheerfully. \u201cI told him you\u2019d probably just got mentally ill from overwork, but he wouldn\u2019t have it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, thanks loads,\u201d Harry said. George gave them both a wave and Apparated away. Harry glared at Ron. \u201cSeriously, a <em>Snatching Sack?</em> You could get a year in Azkaban just for having one!\u201d</p>\n<p>Ron folded his arms, mulishly. \u201cD\u2019you expect me to just <em>sit by</em> while Draco Malfoy does something horrible to you? And don\u2019t try to tell me it just happened, and it\u2019s nothing to do with Hermione going missing. Merlin on toast, Harry, I know we haven\u2019t talked properly lately\u2014I know it\u2019s been rough. But you can\u2019t think I wouldn\u2019t <em>die</em> sooner than leave you in trouble! Or Hermione, for that matter!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t,\u201d Harry said, his throat tight. \u201cReally I don\u2019t, Ron. I know you\u2019d do anything for us, either of us. It\u2019s just not\u2014\u201d He sighed and ran a hand through his hair. \u201cLook, come round and have a drink and I\u2019ll <em>try</em> to explain. As long as you promise not to try to Imperius me out of it or something.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFine, let\u2019s go,\u201d Ron said grudgingly. \u201cBut <em>no</em> promises.\u201d</p>\n<p>#</p>\n<p>\u201cSo I gather Weasley didn\u2019t have you abducted and shipped to New York,\u201d Draco remarked, sliding onto the stool next to his: it was Monday night, and they were back to Old Whissing for drinks at the bar. Evidently Draco hadn\u2019t had any trouble at the door this time. \u201cI thought it was even odds.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWorse than that, probably,\u201d Harry said, scowling. \u201cPleased with yourself?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDelighted,\u201d Draco said blandly. He beckoned the barman over and ordered a Wicked Grace.</p>\n<p>Half a dozen people stopped by to talk to Draco, over totally trivial things, and several others traded nods with him when they saw him from a distance. Harry rolled his eyes as Draco radiated satisfaction. \u201cFine, now explain to me what <em>good</em> any of it does you. You ought to take up stamps or something, they\u2019d store easier than people.\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco snorted. \u201cCome along, then, if you need a demonstration,\u201d he said, and leaned over and took Harry\u2019s favorite Ball Roller out of his satchel.</p>\n<p>He took Harry on a bizarre progress through four different wood-paneled sitting rooms where he picked out a perfectly random witch or wizard in each one, nobody Harry even knew, and struck up a conversation. After five minutes of chit-chat he\u2019d say, \u201cHarry\u2019s been showing me this new kind of pen Muggles have invented, the poor creatures. Have you seen it? A simple Inexhaustible Ink charm, and it would really be quite usable. You\u2019ve been wanting to make a switch at the Aurors\u2019 Office, Potter, haven\u2019t you?\u201d Then he\u2019d scribble a bit with it and hand it over for examination, and five minutes later he\u2019d make an excuse and they\u2019d move onward to the next random victim.</p>\n<p>\u201cDid something happen that I\u2019m missing?\u201d Harry said after the fourth one, when Draco headed for the cloakroom with the demonstration apparently over.</p>\n<p>\u201cInfinitudes, apparently,\u201d Draco said, swinging his cloak back over his shoulders. \u201cIf that wasn\u2019t obvious enough, you\u2019ll just have to wait for it, Potter, I haven\u2019t time to explain tonight. I\u2019ll drop in at the office later this week: perhaps you\u2019ll have worked it out by then.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWait, you\u2019re not\u2014oh, right,\u201d Harry said hurriedly, just barely managing to cover for the fact he\u2019d assumed they were going back to the Manor together. He turned away to put his own coat on, telling himself firmly he <em>wasn\u2019t</em> disappointed, he wasn\u2019t anything <em>like</em> disappointed, and he didn\u2019t wonder at all what Malfoy preferred to shagging him senseless again.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, have I <em>disappointed</em> you<em>?</em>\u201d Draco said, sounding gleeful. Harry gritted his teeth, Ron was right, what <em>was</em> he thinking, he was out of his mind\u2014 \u201cYou do realize it\u2019s the first night of the new moon in twenty minutes.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry jerked round to stare at him. Draco was watching him with a cat-in-the-cream smirk, but Harry didn\u2019t give a damn about that anymore. \u201cDo you need any help?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIf you could help, you could do the work yourself,\u201d Draco said. \u201cDon\u2019t be glum, Potter. I\u2019ll put you over your desk Wednesday and make it up to you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Then Draco caught him by his coat and pulled him in and kissed him, and whirled out the door, all before Harry had a chance to get out the <em>like hell you will</em>.</p>\n<p>#</p>\n<p>Wednesday morning Harry pretended to himself he was shaving both ways just because he liked it, no other reason whatsoever, and he was distracted at work because he was waiting for Malfoy to come and tell him how the first round of repairs to the portal had gone, and he wasn\u2019t looking at the clock or\u2014</p>\n<p>He came straight up in his chair at the knock on the door, but when he cleared his throat and called, \u201c<em>Alohomora!</em>\u201d it only swung open to reveal Raymond Gurley from the postroom with four fat padded envelopes for him, along with a faintly lavender-scented envelope in creamy heavy stock. \u201cSpecial delivery or something, Harry?\u201d he said, dropping them on the desk.</p>\n<p>\u201cEr, I suppose,\u201d Harry said, baffled. \u201cI didn\u2019t order anything.\u201d He didn\u2019t recognize any of the return addresses, either.</p>\n<p>\u201cDid all four of them manage an entry?\u201d Draco said, and Harry\u2019s head jerked up involuntarily as he came in, exchanging places with Gurley\u2019s cart. He came over and perched on the edge of Harry\u2019s desk, peering over at the envelopes. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to know initiative is alive and well in the Empire.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWait, what are these?\u201d Harry said. \u201cDid <em>you</em> order them?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, Potter, <em>you</em> did,\u201d Draco said, ripping the largest of them open and dumping a double handful of faintly glittering ink pens on Harry\u2019s desk, along with a letter from the chairman of Quinchley Quills, Ltd., <em>So lovely to see you at Old Whissing the other day, Auror Potter. I wonder if you would care to try this new product and let us know your thoughts. We take our responsibility in supplying the Department of Magical Enforcement with the finest writing implements available most seriously</em>, and going on a while in that vein.</p>\n<p>\u201cThey were <em>all</em> quill manufacturers?\u201d Harry said, looking through all the letters. There were a dozen different sorts of pens in the lot, some closer to the Rollerball than others, and there were varied special features trumpeted in each.</p>\n<p>Malfoy sighed noisily. \u201cPotter, when you wanted ink pens, I suppose you asked the Ministry to bang in an order with Amazonia or whatever the thing is called? And nevermind the loss of business to wizarding companies that pay tax to the Ministry and buy lunches for senior Ministry officials, et cetera?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cEr,\u201d Harry said.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u201cWell, Quinchley et al will be delighted to slap a cheap charm onto an even cheaper bit of Muggle junk for you, if that\u2019s what you like,\u201d Draco said, flipping a pink pen across at him with a twist of his fingers. \u201cAnd the Ministry will be delighted to buy them for you when the manufacturers offer them at half the price of hand-cut quills plucked from wild geese. Still care to go on at me about the uselessness of cultivating the right people? You could stand to do a little of it yourself.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry compressed his jaw. \u201cRight, and it\u2019s worth the time, is it? All you had to do to get these pens was to know so many people you can recognize executives from four quill manufacturers on sight without even looking them up, then spend the better part of an hour chatting them all up, in a club you had to drag me to just to get let in again, and I don\u2019t even want to guess what to be invited to in the first place\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cMalfoys have been senior members of Old Whissing for three centuries, I\u2019ve been on the rolls since birth. And the pens are your personal stupidity, it\u2019s not about the <em>pens</em>. It\u2019s about getting <em>what you want</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, and nevermind if that\u2019s good or not,\u201d Harry said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to <em>manipulate</em> people into doing things my way, Malfoy. I want them to do things my way because I\u2019ve convinced them it\u2019s the <em>right</em> way!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, of course,\u201d Draco sneered. \u201cIt\u2019s not enough for people to do things for you, you want them to acknowledge your moral superiority.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s <em>not</em> what I mean!\u201d Harry said, standing up, and then the door swung open again.</p>\n<p>\u201cHarry, the analysis just came back in the Wynchblighter case\u2014oh!\u201d Hannah Abbott stopped short in the doorway, going red in the face, staring between them like\u2014well, like she\u2019d read the two-page spread in the <em>Daily Prophet</em>. \u201cS-sorry,\u201d she stammered, starting to back out. \u201cI\u2019ll just\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s all right,\u201d Harry said hurriedly. Behind her out in the office he could see the entire secretarial pool doing one of the worst jobs he\u2019d ever seen of pretending to work.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, no need to flee, Abbott,\u201d Draco said. \u201cA little afternoon delight is all well and good,\u201d Harry glared at him as Hannah went dangerous levels of crimson and even the feeblest attempts at faking work outside ceased entirely, \u201cbut it\u2019s not gone eleven yet, and I am actually here to consult.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh\u2014oh?\u201d was the best Hannah could manage, squeaking out.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Harry said flatly. \u201cMalfoy\u2019s going to look through the Unidentified Artifacts Archive for us. Why don\u2019t you take him over there, I\u2019ll look over the analysis.\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco threw him a narrow look, but swept out behind Hannah without a protest. Harry slapped the door shut behind him and sat down and glared at the analysis in his place, and got about as far with it. It took him half an hour of concentrating before he could hold the names in his head again, and another half an hour after that before he actually processed anything in the report. Then he had to sign off on a sheaf of search warrant applications for the magistrate court and then Neville showed up to ask him a few questions about another recent case, and Harry got lost in work for a while and only remembered about two hours past lunchtime when he absently found himself writing something with the pink pen.</p>\n<p>He put it down and stuck his head out. Hannah was at her desk working on getting the victim\u2019s Astronomy charts drafted up. \u201cMalfoy left, yeah?\u201d</p>\n<p>She looked up. \u201cOh\u2014sorry, Harry, I don\u2019t know. I left him in the archive. Probably, by now?\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry went down to the basement and to the massive storeroom full of the odds and ends no one could make any sense of, evidence in cases or possibly dangerous things acquired from criminals. The door stood ajar. Draco hadn\u2019t left. He was sitting at a worktable, his coat off and thrown over the bench, his sleeves rolled up past the elbow and his tie discarded, his gaze gone axeblade-sharp and narrow, so focused he didn\u2019t even notice Harry come in quietly behind him: in his left hand he was holding a small globe cupped, opened in half and full of tiny gears. There were a dozen more of the gears scattered over the table, none of them bigger than a little fingernail, and with his right hand, he was picking them up one at a time with a fine grey cloth, rubbing them clean and untarnished, then setting them carefully back into the globe, the left hand never even twitching.</p>\n<p>Harry stood, caught by it, until Draco put the last one in and blew on the gears, whispering something, and they shivered and started to move. He tenderly closed up the globe with the tips of his fingers, the whole thing starting to hum and glow, and held it on his palm smiling at it: the kind of smile Harry had never seen on his face, a real one, illuminating, nothing like the smirks and smugness.</p>\n<p>Then he suddenly looked over. He sprang up, his lips pressing together like Harry had found him naked, not working on a device. \u201cHow long have you been standing there?\u201d he said, a little coldly, and Harry wanted to say <em>wait, bring it back, smile like that again, smile like that at\u2014</em></p>\n<p>\u201cI didn\u2019t want to interrupt,\u201d Harry said. He cleared his throat. \u201cDo you want to go get some lunch?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Draco said, and then took out his watch and looked at it. He stuffed it back into his pocket hurriedly. \u201cWe\u2019re for the Venable Bar tomorrow, Potter.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI won\u2019t count it,\u201d Harry said. \u201cI\u2019m just hungry. What is that thing, anyway?\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco tossed it to him: Harry caught it in his hands, a small warm living weight, almost like a Snitch. \u201cIt\u2019s a Secret Bringer, Potter. Tell it a secret, and it carries it forward to the one who can use it as the owner desired. I assume someone smashed it to keep the secret from getting out.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry gave it to Aurelia Jones as they walked out: it was from one of her old investigations. As soon as she took it, the Secret Bringer rang like a bell and started\u2014well, not yelling murder, but singing it out in a high chiming voice, with details, so there was one cold case solved.</p>\n<p>It was four o\u2019clock when they finished lunch. \u201cI, um,\u201d Harry said, looking at the clock on the Gringotts\u2019 tower, after they\u2019d come out into the street. \u201cCan I have a look at the portal now?\u201d There wasn\u2019t much point in going back to the office at this hour.</p>\n<p>\u201cAuror Potter knocking off early for a shag? Whatever will the public say,\u201d Draco said.</p>\n<p>Harry blushed. \u201cJust call the carriage, Malfoy.\u201d</p>\n<p>#</p>\n<p>Malfoy\u2019s owl woke Harry up the next morning, dropping a package with a loud bang on the floor of the bedroom, and Draco sat up straight next to him and was out of bed in a flash, ripping it open and making small triumphant noises over whatever it was, which turned out to be small lumps of iron. \u201cOre samples,\u201d Draco said, flicking his owl a gobbet of raw steak from a plate of treats. \u201cWell done, Bellerophon. The Venable will have to wait, Potter. I\u2019ll Owl you when I have time.\u201d</p>\n<p>He Apparated off with the sack instantly, leaving Harry, a bit bemused, alone with the owl, which only turned its head round at him and hooted when he looked at it. \u201cRight,\u201d Harry said, and got out of bed and went to wash up.</p>\n<p>He didn\u2019t hear a word from Draco for six days, not even when the Conservation of Magical Territory Act had its first reading in the Wizengamot and made a noticeable dent in the third page of the <em>Daily Prophet</em>.</p>\n<p><em>The astute readers of this journal may recognize the extremely limited bounds of this Act, which can be relevant to but a handful of the most ancient wizarding estates, </em>some<em> of which have lately been reduced as a consequence of expenses arising from the Second Wizarding War. It is curious that Arthur Weasley and the progressive wing of the Wizengamot should interest themselves in the welfare of these estates, save perhaps if one remembers that Mr. Weasley is a close associate of the Chief Auror, Mr. Harry Potter, who has lately appeared in the Society pages of this paper in the company of a notorious wizard of ancient lineage. </em></p>\n<p>Harry was glad, reading it: he\u2019d hoped people would put the blame on him. Arthur had been reluctant to put in the bill, and Harry couldn\u2019t blame him, but\u2014it was <em>Hermione</em>. \u201cI know it stinks,\u201d he\u2019d said. \u201cBut you\u2019ve got to. He wouldn\u2019t budge without it. Will it actually hurt anyone?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOnly the expectations of several land speculators,\u201d Arthur had said. \u201cBut Harry, those speculators bought the Malfoy land precisely because they expected to be able to use it. Passing this law makes it nearly impossible for them to do so. It\u2019s legalized robbery\u2014letting Malfoy take their money and effectively keep the land. In fact, they\u2019ll probably end up selling the parcels back to him for a fraction of what they first paid: he\u2019ll be the only buyer.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll offer to buy it from them myself,\u201d Harry said. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I can pay as much as it\u2019s worth, but they can have whatever I\u2019ve got, I don\u2019t care. Please, Arthur.\u201d</p>\n<p>Reading the article made Harry irritated with Draco all over again: he couldn\u2019t just have <em>helped</em>, could he. Harry wrote the letter to the speculators from his desk the next morning, apologizing and offering to buy the property, and he\u2019d just sent it off by owl when Draco sauntered into his office like he owned the place, hands in his trouser pockets and fine grey robes sweeping behind him. \u201cKeeping busy, Potter?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, you could say that,\u201d Harry said, a little coldly. \u201cWhat about <em>you</em>, Malfoy?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWith this and that,\u201d Draco said. \u201cThe reforging\u2019s done.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWait, all of it? I thought you said to had to reforge all the bars!\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco waved a hand airily\u2014Harry noticed abruptly there was a faintly red mark along the side just peeking out from under the cuff. \u201cI was in the mood to finish it off. And you\u2019re in luck: I\u2019ve got ahead of schedule. I\u2019ve looked into it and I think I can use the first night of the full moon to finish off the last sealing spells, after all. Next week should do it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNext\u2014\u201d Harry reared up from his chair and grabbed him and kissed him, ignoring Draco\u2019s muffled exclamation and the open door behind him. Draco nearly toppled off the desk into Harry\u2019s lap, and then he twisted around and braced himself and kissed him back. Harry blindly grabbed for his wand and waved it vaguely at the door, which closed with a thump. The blinds all zipped down obligingly as Harry climbed up onto the desk, shoving at Draco\u2019s robes.</p>\n<p>The next morning, the <em>Daily Prophet</em> ran a gossip item about sexual escapades in the Auror Division and an editorial by Rita Skeeter condemning the exchange of sexual favors for political ones. <em>It comes as no surprise to this writer that those who most loudly rail against corruption and influence are those who succumb most thoroughly when temptation crosses their own path</em>, which Harry figured would make Draco happy. He was counting on it, really: if he was going to get raked over the coals in the press, he was looking forward to having the whole thing made up to him, except instead Draco scowled fiercely at the paper over the breakfast table.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat witch needs a lesson in picking her targets,\u201d he said.</p>\n<p>\u201cWait, didn\u2019t you want us written up?\u201d Harry said, baffled.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not interested in coming across as a <em>tart</em>, Potter!\u201d Draco said, which didn\u2019t make any sense to Harry, since last week Draco had been perfectly happy for everyone to think he was shagging Harry into submission. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll soon settle her,\u201d Draco added, ominously, and sadly, it looked as though there wasn\u2019t a morning shag in Harry\u2019s future after all.</p>\n<p>\u201cAre we having lunch today?\u201d he asked.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Draco said, still brooding vindictively over the paper. \u201cNot after this rubbish. I\u2019ll take you to the symphony tonight instead. Wear a proper suit\u2014do you <em>have</em> a proper suit?\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry couldn\u2019t help noticing the sidelong and unhappy looks all over the office as he went to his desk. He was sorry for it\u2014he wanted to apologize, wanted to explain, only he couldn\u2019t, because it wasn\u2019t actually any less corrupt for him to trade Draco political favors for his help saving Hermione than it would\u2019ve been to do it for the sex. The law wasn\u2019t for him to barter, and he knew it, but he couldn\u2019t do otherwise. Telling people he was doing it for Hermione\u2014that was like making her an excuse, when the truth was Harry knew flat-out that Ron was right: Hermione wouldn\u2019t have wanted him making any kind of dirty under-the-table deal with Draco, sex or no sex, not for her sake.</p>\n<p>But he couldn\u2019t bear to lose her, and he wasn\u2019t <em>going</em> to lose her, not as long as he had the least scrap of a chance. He didn\u2019t care what happened to his reputation. He\u2019d give his life to make things better, to make things right, but he wouldn\u2019t give Hermione\u2019s. He <em>wouldn\u2019t</em>.</p>\n<p>He kept his head down and worked steadily the whole day. The backlog had piled up and was still piling up, but he\u2019d made a dent in it after the last week left to his own devices, and around midmorning he made it back as far as the ink pens and the lavender-scented envelope. He hadn\u2019t even opened it yet: he knew the type, letters from old biddy witches who wanted Harry Potter, only, to deal with their difficulty, which was usually that they\u2019d put a piece of family jewelry somewhere and forgotten it, except for that one time when a witch had plaintively said, \u201cIt\u2019s Basil, I just <em>know</em> he\u2019s round here somewhere, and he\u2019s got my <em>wand</em>,\u201d which Harry had assumed was a cat or something and turned out to be her good-for-nothing nephew. He\u2019d become still less good for anything after he was turned into a vampire, and when he\u2019d come looking for a snack, she\u2019d staked him through the heart with her wand. That hadn\u2019t been quite large enough to do the job, though, so he\u2019d managed to stagger away and kept waking up during the night and shambling around the big old house before falling over into a different dark corner again at dawn.</p>\n<p>These days he usually foisted those requests off onto junior Aurors with the posh voices, but when he opened the letter, he noticed it felt oddly familiar\u2014like Draco\u2019s stationery, he realized after a moment, a kind of thick heavy parchment that caught the light and shimmered if you turned it sideways, with a picture coming visible at the right angle. Draco\u2019s was a dragon, twisting around itself; this one was a wide-branched tree covered with fruit and flowers. The letter itself wasn\u2019t out of the usual way, just a, <em>Dear Chief Auror, I should be grateful for the favor of a visit if it were not inconvenient, to consult you upon a matter relating to my family. With regards, Emmeline Fawley Garridge</em></p>\n<p>Harry looked at it a moment and then got up and poked around the halls until he found Maisie Greenwalker, one of the interns, whose family were all posh pureblood; she took one look at the note and her eyebrows flew up. \u201cOh, lord, you\u2019ve been summoned to the presence, have you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cEr, have I?\u201d Harry said. \u201cWho is she?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWho is\u2014\u201d She stared at him, then said, \u201cRight! Well, she\u2019s a Fawley, of course, and she married Hepzibah Garridge\u2014not quite old enough a family to be Sacred Twenty-Eight, but close enough for respectability\u2014and she had twelve daughters before he passed away. Emmeline\u2019s Dozen. They kept trying for a son, you see, because the estate was entailed. Anyway, all of her daughters married into wizard families, and all of them had at least six children, and those children had any number of children, et cetera, and by now you can\u2019t throw a rock in Diagon Alley without hitting one of her descendants. She has the whole clan together on Boxing Day every year and they need to take the Expansive Ballroom at the Grand Surrey Hotel. You\u2019d better go, you know. If you treat the matriarch with disrespect, you\u2019ll get the whole lot of them down on you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGot it,\u201d Harry said, and he went back to his office and put the letter on the side of the desk, determinedly ignoring it for the rest of the morning, because it wasn\u2019t real work, it <em>wasn\u2019t</em>, but when the lunch hour came, he put on his robes and Apparated to the house. It wasn\u2019t like Malfoy\u2019s place or even 12 Grimmauld Place, just a nice sensible cottage, although the garden was especially beautiful, walled with stone and full of magic herbs and flowers and a small running brook. A tall middle-aged woman was working on one of the beds; she pushed her hair back off her head when Harry came up and said, \u201cCan I help you?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHi, I\u2019m\u2014I\u2019m Harry Potter,\u201d he said. \u201cMrs. Garridge asked for me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh! You are, aren\u2019t you,\u201d she said, looking at his face. \u201cCome inside, then.\u201d</p>\n<p>The house was like the garden, beautifully tended without being ornate. The woman led Harry to a sitting room in back where a very old witch, white-haired and with almost translucent skin, was sitting by the window reading a book. \u201cGranny, it\u2019s Harry Potter to see you.\u201d</p>\n<p>She looked up and blinked at Harry, her green eyes a little filmy over the half-moon reading spectacles. \u201cHello, dear,\u201d she said. \u201cDo sit down. Thank you, Eleanor darling.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry sat down. Mrs. Garridge just looked at him in total silence for a long while, until he finally ventured, \u201cWas there something I could help you with, ma\u2019am? Have you lost anything?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIn a manner of speaking, I suppose I have,\u201d she said. \u201cWould you be so kind as to bring me down that chart there on the top shelf?\u201d</p>\n<p>It turned out what she actually wanted him to do was have him bring her one massive genealogical chart after another, starting with her own daughters\u2014thirteen of them, not twelve, so it had evidently been a baker\u2019s dozen. Harry dutifully laid out the second and third generations on top, gritting his teeth and trying not to glare at the smiling pen-and-ink faces peering back at him with interest.</p>\n<p>The thirteenth daughter\u2019s picture didn\u2019t stir, though, and her husband didn\u2019t come with a two-generation tree of his own like all the others had, full of pureblood wizarding names. George Herbert Wrixton just appeared unceremoniously out of nowhere to take the hand of Lillian Rose Garridge and produce one daughter, before dying young.</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you want the next?\u201d Harry said, trying to be polite.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, thank you, perhaps one more,\u201d Emmeline said, and Harry got it down: Lillian\u2019s daughter Emma, her picture also still and unmoving, with a marriage to another obscurity named Peter William Evans\u2014</p>\n<p>Harry stopped unfolding the chart. He lifted his head and stared at Emmeline\u2014at the green eyes, twinkling at him now, behind her spectacles, and then he slowly finished laying out the chart to find a son named Richard Evans, with two daughters, named Lily and Petunia.</p>\n<p>#</p>\n<p>He wasn\u2019t much use at work the rest of the day, feeling pretty dazed. He\u2019d gone from having no family at all to having apparently <em>all</em> the family there was. He\u2019d sat with Emmeline\u2014\u201cCall me Granny, Harry dear, everyone does. There\u2019s no sense bothering with all those greats\u201d\u2014for nearly an hour, and six or seven people had wandered in and out of the house\u2014on errands for her of one sort or another, or just to say hello or bring her flowers, and all of them were <em>his</em>, his cousins and aunts and uncles. Somewhat removed, maybe, but perfectly willing to own him and welcome him.</p>\n<p>Draco appeared at six to take him to the symphony, and Harry let himself get towed along and sat through the music without really hearing anything. \u201cShall we have a drink?\u201d Draco said afterwards.</p>\n<p>\u201cSomething really weird happened to me today,\u201d Harry said, when they were sitting at the bar together. \u201cDo you know Emmeline Garridge?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course I do, Potter, everyone knows the old battleship,\u201d Draco said. \u201cWhat about her?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShe\u2019s my\u2014\u201d he had to stop to count it, \u201cgreat-great-great-grandmother. On my mother\u2019s side. It turns out her youngest daughter was a Squib, and\u2026\u201d he trailed off, because Draco was staring at him like Harry had just set himself on fire and was turning cartwheels. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re one of the <em>Horde?</em>\u201d Draco said. Then, warily, \u201cAm I in trouble?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cEr, what? Why?\u201d Harry said, baffled.</p>\n<p>\u201cFor taking advantage of you!\u201d Draco said. \u201cJust so we\u2019re clear, Potter, if you\u2019re going to sic that crowd on me, I\u2019m <em>right out</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry stared at him. \u201cWhat are you <em>talking</em> about, Malfoy? She\u2019s just a nice old lady!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, yes, sitting quietly by the fire in her tidy little cottage. Fell right for the window dressing, didn\u2019t you,\u201d Draco said. \u201cEmmeline Garridge married <em>twelve daughters</em> of dubious ancestry into the Sacred Twenty-Eight, and none of them had so much as a Knut in dowry! She\u2019s the most terrifying strategist in the entire wizarding world, and she has an army larger than Voldemort\u2019s at her command.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDraco, you\u2019re <em>mental</em>,\u201d Harry said.</p>\n<p>#</p>\n<p>After the rest of the week, where Harry found himself at the cottage three times without completely meaning to, he started to think maybe Draco wasn\u2019t entirely wrong about Emmeline. It wasn\u2019t like she <em>demanded</em> he come round, but her owls seemed to unerringly catch him on his way out the door, exactly the right moment when he could stop by without interrupting something else, and the requests were always something small and reasonable\u2014she hoped he might come by with a photograph of his mother and James when convenient, so she might invite them into the chart; perhaps he ought to stop in that evening and meet his third cousin Adler Griffin, who was having trouble with Dementors on the border of his estate; that sort of thing.</p>\n<p>He didn\u2019t <em>mind</em>\u2014it was nice, even, having someone interested in him personally, wanting to know him in a familial way. But there was something a bit firm and determined about it, too, and when he came by with the photograph that weekend, Emmeline managed to get him to stay for tea, and while the cups were pouring she said, \u201cHarry, I hope you will forgive an old woman for prying a little about this business of yours with that Malfoy boy.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUm,\u201d Harry said, feeling his face go red.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe family\u2019s very old, of course,\u201d she said, sipping her tea. \u201cIn fact, Lucius Malfoy courted one of my granddaughter\u2019s girls while at school. We did not quite think it an appropriate match.\u201d She paused and peered over her spectacles at Harry intently. \u201cIt must be quite difficult for you to meet anyone, with your work. I don\u2019t imagine you would like anything formal, but perhaps you might permit me to introduce you more widely? Our family has a wide acquaintance.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, that\u2019s all right, thanks,\u201d Harry said hastily. \u201cI\u2019m\u2014I\u2019m fine. Draco\u2019s all right?\u201d he added, which he weirdly found he meant. Draco was odd and and an absolute maniac about his social standing and wasn\u2019t anything like heroic, but he <em>had</em> stayed <em>all right</em>, somehow, even with his horrible dad and Voldemort breathing down his neck. Harry had a brief flash of that moment down in the archives, the look on Draco\u2019s face as he\u2019d smiled at the Secret-Bringer; he swallowed.</p>\n<p>Emmeline studied him narrowly a moment longer. \u201cOf course,\u201d she said, a small frown creasing her forehead as she turned back to the tea sandwiches. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you bring him for dinner tomorrow, then,\u201d she added. \u201cI\u2019d like to meet him. These articles in the <em>Daily Prophet</em> have certainly been unfortunate, but perhaps I\u2019d best form my own opinion.\u201d</p>\n<p>#</p>\n<p>\u201cI should never have let you on the grounds,\u201d Draco said flatly. \u201cYou\u2019re trouble and you\u2019ve always been trouble. Why couldn\u2019t I <em>remember</em> that?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHey!\u201d Harry said, indignantly. \u201cShe just wants to meet you, Malfoy. I\u2019d think you\u2019d be glad of a chance to make good with her, if she\u2019s you think she\u2019s so powerful.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t want to <em>meet</em> me, Potter,\u201d Draco snapped. \u201cShe wants to <em>vet</em> me, and if she decides I\u2019m not up to snuff, she\u2019s not going to have any of your scruples about fairness and justice and all that rot, she\u2019s just going to have her entire clan work on hounding me out of the country, and my position is <em>not</em> strong enough to handle them yet! What am I going to wear?\u201d He went to his wardrobe and flung it completely open, the eighteen folding cabinets going the full length of the room.</p>\n<p>He also insisted on going to get flowers, but not just any flowers, they had to visit six different shops before he collected adequate examples of the four extremely specific blooms he wanted, which then had to all be unwrapped and combined with another particular kind of leafy thing, and wrapped again in special paper\u2014\u201cDraco!\u201d Harry said finally. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you just get her a diamond necklace or something.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cInappropriate and vulgar,\u201d Draco muttered, still frowning and fiddling with the knot. \u201cAll right, there, that\u2019s adequate.\u201d</p>\n<p>Emmeline took the bouquet with a restrained smile. \u201cHow thoughtful,\u201d she said, and immediately gave it to her granddaughter Olivia without giving it so much as a second glance. \u201cHow is your mother, dear? I haven\u2019t seen Narcissa in some time. Of course I wasn\u2019t quite up to attending Pansy\u2019s debut.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s kind of you to ask after her. I\u2019m afraid she\u2019s gone abroad. The healers recommended a change of climate\u2014my father\u2019s final illness took a great deal out of her,\u201d Draco said. Harry had never heard him sound so polite before, not even to professors at Hogwarts.</p>\n<p>Dinner wasn\u2019t elaborate, just half a dozen of the family around a simple table in a cozy dining room\u2014nothing like the level of the Manor, which liked to serve breakfast as a three-course meal on Ming-era porcelain if Draco didn\u2019t hurry things along. It wasn\u2019t the warm noisy chaos of the Burrow, either; everyone had good manners and one of the small boys at the table was gently corrected when he bellowed for pudding, but it was friendly and easy, everyone passing dishes and chatting about other relatives, the day\u2019s news. Draco stayed excruciatingly correct and formal all through the meal\u2014he anyway had the kind of manners that made you surreptitiously check you weren\u2019t doing something wrong yourself, and apparently being nervous made them come on full display. He was also, Harry realized, vaporizing some of his wine every time he took a sip, like he was afraid to even finish a single glass.</p>\n<p>The rest of the family peeled away after dinner as the plates began to disappear and they all stood. \u201cWhy don\u2019t we go into the sitting room and be comfortable, unless the men want port,\u201d Emmeline said. \u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, that\u2019s fine,\u201d Harry said, after a quick glance at Draco, who just gave him a jerk of a nod. Once they were ensconced, Emmeline asked Draco a lot of completely innocuous questions, Draco gave a lot of completely innocuous answers, and Harry started to have the feeling he was watching a tennis match.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe two of you went to school together, of course,\u201d she said. \u201cWere you very close in those days, Harry?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cClose to murdering each other, maybe,\u201d Harry said, because there really wasn\u2019t any other way of describing it, and Draco coughed and said smoothly, \u201cWe were rival Seekers, of course,\u201d like you could roll up six years of violent hatred and landing on opposite sides of the war into a game of Quidditch.</p>\n<p>\u201cHow interesting that you should have become so friendly since,\u201d Emmeline said, with a faintly disapproving look, where what she clearly meant was, how odd that you should have started letting Draco Malfoy shag you into the papers.</p>\n<p>One of her granddaughters called over the Floo, and she stepped into the other room to take it. Draco sprang up from where he\u2019d been reclining easily on the sofa next to Harry and went pacing round the room in circles like a mechanical doll someone had wound up too tight. \u201cAre you all right?\u201d Harry said. Draco glared at him and jerked his head towards the other room, as if to say, <em>shh!</em> \u201cYou could just relax a bit, you know.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cJust <em>listen</em> to you,\u201d Draco hissed, barely audible. \u201c<em>You</em> can relax. You\u2019re the high hero of the wizarding world, you\u2019ve a fortune and a pedigree: they\u2019re delighted to claim you. Three weeks ago I couldn\u2019t get into my <em>club</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry rolled his eyes. \u201cFine, fret yourself sick if you want to. I\u2019m going to the loo.\u201d</p>\n<p>He came back after a few minutes and found Emmeline standing in the other doorway looking in a bit perplexed at Draco. He was perched on the edge of the piano bench, and he\u2019d got hold of one of the curios off a shelf: a worn old wooden toy of some sort, it looked like a little wizard figure sitting on a box with a tiny door cut into it, although it was almost more keyhole than door. He\u2019d opened up the underside and was glaring into it narrow-eyed, and then he muttered, \u201cOh, I see,\u201d and took out his wand, waved it with a mutter, and floated out a single tiny glass bead.</p>\n<p>He reached in and tapped something else with his wand, murmuring a charm, then he shut it up, turned it over, put it on the piano. \u201cGo on, then,\u201d he told it. The wizard sat for a moment, stirred jerkily, then slowly raised up its arms\u2014it had a tiny stick-wand in one hand\u2014and squeaked, \u201c<em>Alohomora!\u201d</em> The tiny door sprang open, and a spray of tiny blue-and-pink butterflies erupted out and flew across the room and out the open window.</p>\n<p>Draco sat back, looking enormously pleased with himself. Then nearly jumped out of his skin when Emmeline said, \u201cGood heavens, have you really fixed that old thing?\u201d from behind him.</p>\n<p>He jerked to his feet stiff as a block again, but Emmeline had stepped past him and picked up the little wizard box in her hands, something changed in her face, a half-unwilling softness creeping in. \u201cWhy, that hasn\u2019t worked since\u2014oh, since my third was still a baby,\u201d she said, a tiny catch in her voice. \u201cMy dear grandfather bought it for me when I was just a child.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFrom Warrant\u2019s Wonderful Emporium?\u201d Draco said. \u201cIt has rather the feel of their work.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy, yes,\u201d Emmeline said, turning to him, and Harry spent the next two hours following along bemusedly while Emmeline led Draco all over the house and into the attics and they poked over at least fifty different things all of which were at least a hundred years old. By the end of the night she let Draco kiss her cheek as they left. Harry turned to him in the carriage. \u201cSo that didn\u2019t turn out too,\u201d he started, and that was the last thing he had a chance to say for some time.</p>\n<p>#</p>\n<p>Harry had to take off the next day and spend it at the solicitors\u2019 signing contracts and the largest cheque he\u2019d ever written in his life. It was a bit of a gulp to look at all the zeroes. Even after getting it, though, the speculators looked glum. \u201cCould\u2019ve subdivided it into a <em>thousand</em> lots,\u201d one of them said to Harry mournfully.</p>\n<p>\u201cIf it\u2019s not enough,\u201d Harry started, but his lawyer, an old bewhiskered wizard named Rowley whom he\u2019d inherited along with Sirius\u2019 estate, cleared his throat loudly and said, \u201cI believe we\u2019ve finished, gentlemen,\u201d and ushered the speculators out.</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t you let them make you feel guilty,\u201d he told Harry sternly. \u201cThey got that land for a song to begin with: I dare say Malfoy hadn\u2019t any idea what prime land on a direct commuter line to London is worth these days. And in my opinion, that law was a fine bit of work, whatever the Daily Prophet likes to say about it. A thousand acres of untouched magical woodland, cut down for Muggle town houses? Outrageous. Outrageous! Why, do you know the Malfoy woods are the only place in Britain where one may still find the Sparkling Red-Crested Gollup?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cEr, really?\u201d Harry said. He hadn\u2019t any idea what a Sparkling Red-Crested Gollup was, but Rowley evidently did, by his firm nod.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy, even Muggles wouldn\u2019t let them do it, you know,\u201d he said. \u201cThe lands are disguised as a hazardous-waste dumpsite to keep out trespassers, otherwise they\u2019d be protected by Muggle law, too. That\u2019s why those scoundrels wanted them. You ought to be proud of balking them.\u201d He harrumphed in indignation again. \u201cIt\u2019s good to know you and Weasley aren\u2019t only bent on trampling all tradition,\u201d he added abruptly, to Harry\u2019s bemusement\u2014Rowley had always done his work with rigidly thorough precision, but this was more words than he\u2019d ever said to Harry about anything else. \u201cThere\u2019s enough that needs mending without letting people knock down things that don\u2019t.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cD\u2019you know what a Sparkling Red-Crested Gollup is?\u201d Harry asked Draco that evening, when they got back to the Manor after dinner at Quaffley\u2019s Salon. The moon was a little more than three-quarters full, shining through the bedroom windows from above the trees.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s something like a bat,\u201d Draco said absently. He was stretched out on the bed and going through his large heap of mail with murmurs of satisfaction. \u201cThere\u2019s a kind of tree in the woods they live in. Every spring during mating season, they put up a wild racket and set off little fireworks for three days in a\u2026row\u2026\u201d he trailed off, jerking an envelope out of the pile from under six other messages: a large deep blue envelope with his name and address handwritten across the front, with shooting stars going across the face at regular intervals. It looked vaguely familiar: Harry remembered he\u2019d found one on the stoop himself, yesterday, and chucked it in with the rest of the mail from strangers that he only opened once a month.</p>\n<p>Draco just held it in his hands a moment, gone still, and then he turned it over and opened the flap, carefully, his mouth pressed tight as though he was almost afraid of what was going to be inside. He drew out a stiff card, which flung up another burst of stars that spelled out the words <em>THE FAVOUR OF YOUR PRESENCE IS REQUESTED AT THE 893<sup>RD</sup> ANNUAL MIDSUMMER FESTIVAL OF STARS</em>.</p>\n<p>\u201cIs that something important?\u201d Harry said.</p>\n<p>\u201cEveryone goes, Potter,\u201d Draco said shortly, still staring at it. His jaw was tight. \u201cIf they can. We haven\u2019t been able to get on the guest list since my father was sent to Azkaban.\u201d He looked at Harry with a frown. \u201cYou <em>must</em> have been invited.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cEr,\u201d Harry said.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t go,\u201d Draco said resignedly.</p>\n<p>\u201cI didn\u2019t go,\u201d Harry said.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, you\u2019ll go <em>this</em> year,\u201d Draco said, holding the card up to the window. \u201c<em>With </em>a new set of robes: I\u2019m sending you to my tailors.\u201d He actually laughed aloud, jubilantly, and pulled Harry in to kiss him. \u201cYou\u2019ll even enjoy yourself: it\u2019s spectacular.\u201d</p>\n<p>He tossed the card with a quick flip over to stick directly to the mirror on his wardrobe, and shoved the rest of the mail off the bed. Harry brightened, watching the letters slide to the floor, and then Draco was climbing into his arms, pushing him back into the pillows, kissing his breath away.</p>\n<p>#</p>\n<p>Thursday morning, Harry came to work and found Draco already there and waiting for him in his office, staring out the window with his hands clasped behind his back. He was wearing plain black robes, and there were faint circles under his eyes. \u201cEverything all right?\u201d Harry said, half reaching out to him.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s done,\u201d Draco said.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Harry froze. He cleared his throat. \u201cWhen can I try it?\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco didn\u2019t answer for a moment. \u201cWhenever you like,\u201d he said finally.</p>\n<p>Harry had put together his best shot at a ritual and he\u2019d run it past half a dozen of the top wizards and witches in Finland: they all thought it was as good as it was going to get. His hands were shaking a bit as he packed up his notes, and then he scribbled a final quick letter. <em>Ron, I\u2019m going after Hermione. If I don\u2019t get back, the house and everything\u2019s yours, but do me a favor and give the woods back to Draco. Sorry, I know you\u2019ll be angry\u2014don\u2019t blame him, he only did what I asked. Love, Harry</em>, and folded it and left it on the top of the desk. Someone would find it, going through his things.</p>\n<p>\u201cRight, let\u2019s go,\u201d he said, and they Apparated back to the Manor.</p>\n<p>Draco had moved the portal outside, into a clearing just a little way from the house, with a stone ring around it. It looked worlds different: the heavy iron bars balanced each other out now, so the whole design looked somehow delicate, and everything had a faint silvery shimmer to it that extended even to the empty space in the middle, almost like an opalescence laid over the world.</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you sure about this, Potter?\u201d Draco said. \u201cI realize insane heroics are your stock in trade, but it\u2019s not going to do Granger any good if you just rip yourself apart with an imbalanced vortex.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry looked at him. Draco didn\u2019t meet his eyes: he was looking at the portal, unsmiling. \u201cThis isn\u2019t going to make an imbalanced vortex, is it?\u201d Harry said quietly.</p>\n<p>Draco looked over at him, his jaw tight. \u201cNo promises,\u201d he snapped, but then he looked away. \u201cNot unless you do something more stupid than usual. That still doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s remotely safe to go through. The shamans used to spend a decade preparing for the journey.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right,\u201d Harry said. \u201cI think I\u2019ve already been partway.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, <em>that\u2019s</em> certainly a recommendation for going back,\u201d Draco said, snippy.</p>\n<p>Harry looked over the notes one more time, then put them down in the corner. He held his wand pointing at the top of the portal and spoke the opening chant, once, twice\u2014by the second time, he could see the vortex beginning to form, swirling. Draco backed well away. Harry kept going, three times, four, five, having to shout as the wind picked up, whipping leaves around him, the vortex going faster and faster. It stayed inside the bounds of the portal, though, until he finished the sixth repetition and suddenly the whole thing gave a sort of <em>hiccup</em> and went smooth and glassy-black as obsidian, filling the portal ring.</p>\n<p>Harry dropped his hand, panting, and stared at it. Draco had drifted back up to him, drawn despite himself, his eyes dazzled and hungry. \u201cOh, it goes <em>down</em>,\u201d he murmured.</p>\n<p>\u201cRight,\u201d Harry said, and took a deep breath. He felt a stupid urge to grab Draco and kiss him, like some sort of romantic farewell. \u201cHere goes nothing.\u201d</p>\n<p>He walked up to the gate, his wand in his hand. He reached up. \u201cWait, how are you going to\u2014\u201d Draco said suddenly, behind him, but then Harry touched the surface and all of a sudden the world turned over.</p>\n<p>Harry had one moment to think <em>shit, right, it goes DOWN</em>, and then he was falling, arms windmilling, everything around him a grey blur until he landed with a sudden thump\u2014a fall that ought to have killed him, except it hadn\u2019t even hurt. He stood up. There was nothing to see anywhere but grey hills, rolling gently away in every direction, and then he finished turning in a complete circle and Hermione was suddenly just there, right in front of him.</p>\n<p>She looked\u2014she looked awful, almost as grey as the landscape, the brown faded out of her hair and all the color out of her face. Only her eyes still had a tiny hint of brown, and her wand-hand. \u201cHarry?\u201d she said, staring at him blankly. He stared at her in total confusion for a moment, and then he had her in his arms. \u00a0</p>\n<p>She was strange and stiff for a moment, and then she lurched and was suddenly clinging to him, shaking, gasping. \u201cOh, you came,\u201d she said, her voice breaking. \u201cI knew you\u2019d come if you could, but I didn\u2019t think\u2014you <em>came</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d Harry said. \u201cYes, I came. Hermione, are you okay?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d Hermione said, gulping, pulling back to wipe at her face: she was crying, and where she rubbed the back of her hand across her face the tears smeared color back into her skin. \u201cYes. I\u2019m fine. I\u2019ll be fine. It\u2019s just\u2014it\u2019s been too long. It\u2019s hard to remember you\u2019re alive, here. It\u2019s been too long,\u201d she repeated, and gasped like she couldn\u2019t get enough air.</p>\n<p>\u201cRight,\u201d Harry said. \u201cI\u2019m getting you out of here. Come on, the gate\u2019s stable, it\u2019s right up there\u2014\u201d and then he had a strange, sudden moment of horror, turning, looking up, where the tiny black circle of the portal hung in the air. \u201cWe\u2019ll levitate up to it,\u201d he said, after a moment.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe can\u2019t,\u201d Hermione said. She was shaking, next to him. \u201cHarry, we can\u2019t. Spells don\u2019t work here.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry stood, staring up at it helplessly, and then he squinted\u2014there was something else falling, falling fast towards them, a long snaking thing, and then it thumped into the ground at his feet: a shimmering green cord, one end tied round one of the rocks from the stone circle, and the other going up and up into the air.</p>\n<p>Harry tied it around him and Hermione, tied her wrists round his neck, too, and started climbing. The rope began pulling them in after his weight came on it, though, and he stopped trying and just held on, one arm wrapped around Hermione\u2019s waist. The portal started to come closer faster and faster the further they got from the ground, until it was suddenly rushing across the final distance and Harry fell out tumbling into the dirt with Hermione cradled in his arms.</p>\n<p>Draco was standing just a few paces away, using his wand on a tall stone windlass that was winding the cord up. As soon as they fell through, he shouted, \u201c<em>Finite incantatem!</em>\u201d at the portal, and Harry heard it <em>whooshing</em> shut, like a box. Hermione had gone limp in his arms, still mostly grey. Draco ran over. Harry looked up at him. \u201cThanks,\u201d he panted. \u201cI\u2019ve got to get her to St. Mungo\u2019s.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d Draco said, and Harry lifted Hermione up and Apparated away.</p>\n<p>#</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe you,\u201d Hermione said, glaring at him from the hospital bed. Ron was sitting next to her with arms folded and a righteous expression.</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2019Mione\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou slept with Draco Malfoy!\u201d she said furiously. \u201cYou did favors for Draco Malfoy! How could you ever think I\u2019d want\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI didn\u2019t!\u201d Harry yelled. \u201cI thought <em>I</em> wanted. I did it for me, all right? I did all of it for me, and I know it was rotten and selfish and I don\u2019t care and I\u2019d do it all over again and also I might just keep seeing him,\u201d which Harry figured was worth trying to slip past them while there was some distraction available.</p>\n<p>It only worked the other way round: Hermione and Ron both stopped worrying about what Harry had done to get her back and started worrying that Harry had lost his mind. A lot more yelling and persuasive arguments ensued, about how Draco was only using him and Harry couldn\u2019t trust him, which was probably all true but didn\u2019t help with the central problem that Harry didn\u2019t <em>want</em> to end it, no matter how stupid that was.</p>\n<p>\u201cLook, I know he\u2019s using me!\u201d Harry said. \u201cHe\u2019s <em>said</em> so. But he\u2019s\u2014he\u2019s\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBrilliant in bed, I understand,\u201d Hermione said, arms folded, and Harry blushed and also glared at Ron, the traitor.</p>\n<p>\u201cFine, yes, and he\u2019s good company, and he <em>helped</em> me,\u201d Harry said. \u201cAnd you. You\u2019re alive because of him, and if I\u2019m being stupid, all right, I can be stupid if I want to.\u201d</p>\n<p>He went back to work the next day at peace with the fact he was dating Draco Malfoy. Weird as it was, it was also the most successful relationship he\u2019d ever managed, anyway. They\u2019d already had plans to meet at Old Whissing that night, and when he got to the club, Wheedle took him through the back to a private room, where Draco was sitting at the table with one drink already down, buttoned up to the neck in his sharpest black robes. When Harry sat down, Draco said without looking at him, \u201cThanks for coming. Granger\u2019s all right, I presume?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d Harry said, realizing he\u2019d never thought of dropping a line: he\u2019d been so preoccupied at St. Mungo\u2019s. \u201cYeah\u2014yeah, she\u2019s going to be fine. Thanks.\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco nodded. Harry took a deep breath, meaning to say, <em>look, so how about dinner tomorrow, too</em>, and then Draco said abruptly, \u201cI realize the terms have been fulfilled, but I trust you\u2019ll do me one last favor,\u201d and the words stopped in Harry\u2019s throat, sinking down into the pit of his stomach.</p>\n<p>After a moment of silence, Draco went on, \u201cI can\u2019t afford to end things the wrong way. If it looks like you\u2019ve spurned me, the world will follow you; if it looks like I\u2019ve spurned you, the Horde will go on the warpath. We need to stage the thing properly. The festival should do.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2014want to break up there,\u201d Harry said, trying not to feel anything about it. He\u2019d <em>known</em>, he\u2019d known all along.</p>\n<p>\u201cIn a manner of speaking,\u201d Draco said. \u201cNo one likes a scene. I\u2019ll leak something to the press to soften it up beforehand\u2014we\u2019re seeing other people, neither of us looking to settle down, that sort of thing. Then we\u2019ll simply both show up with other companions, greet each other warmly and spend a few minutes talking in sight of the crowd, like grown adults.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cRight,\u201d Harry said. \u201cSure.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, I thought you\u2019d be a gentleman about it,\u201d Draco said. He downed the rest of his glass. \u201cI\u2019ll be going, then, Potter. I\u2019ll see you in a week.\u201d He was already up, striding out the door, and Harry just sat there alone in the quiet wood-panelled room for a long time.</p>\n<p>#</p>\n<p>The festival was like stepping into a dream, a real dream: a dazzling parade of wizards and witches, each more spectacularly dressed than the next, moving like shining satellites beneath the glitter of fairy lights hung by real fairies, who were dancing themselves as they put up still more of them, throwing extra handfuls of stars into the night sky. Laughter and music and the ballroom floor full of people in fantastic garb, gliding in strange, stately dances, the skirts of their robes whirling and their feet lifting from the ground, going up the pillars and turning over, the orchestra in mid-air playing wild reels, like Chagall paintings come alive.</p>\n<p>People smiled at him and nodded to him and even talked to him, some of them people he even vaguely recognized from the club, but he had no idea who any of them were or what they wanted or what to say to them. <em>Draco</em> would\u2019ve known. This was what Draco had wanted, what he\u2019d loved and missed: he would\u2019ve murmured names and sly gossip in Harry\u2019s ear without even having to think about it, would\u2019ve known the steps of all the dances, would\u2019ve dragged him off into a dark corner afterwards to slide his hand expertly through Harry\u2019s robes and torment him for a while before they plunged back into the whirl, breathless and half out of their heads, under the turning chandeliers with their chips of rainbow glass.</p>\n<p>Harry was sure loads of Emmeline\u2019s family were around, but he didn\u2019t know them to look at them, he hadn\u2019t met most of them yet. He hadn\u2019t been able to tell Emmeline anything like, <em>actually, please do introduce me around</em>, because she would have looked at him with his mother\u2019s green eyes and then she would\u2019ve known and she probably would\u2019ve set the clan on Draco after all. Instead he\u2019d taken Lucy Macmillan, Ernie\u2019s sister, because when he asked round the office if anyone wanted to go, she\u2019d nearly taken him out at the knees for the invitation. At least someone could have a good time.</p>\n<p>Lucy found her friends and introduced him, and he tried to just stop thinking and distract himself with conversation, but he couldn\u2019t stand it; everyone was looking sideways at the two of them, smiling like they thought they knew exactly what Draco wanted them to know. Harry twisted away from their looks and moved away into the crowd, downing one champagne after another whenever anyone offered him a glass, letting the lights blur and the music buffet him around the party.</p>\n<p>He didn\u2019t feel like a gentleman or a grown adult. He felt like a howling child with someone taking away something he desperately wanted, that he hadn\u2019t known he wanted until he realized he couldn\u2019t have it. All he wanted to do was kick and scream, and Harry knew he shouldn\u2019t keep drinking, because he didn\u2019t care about the party, about the joyful dazzle of it all, the galaxy turning under his feet and the music of laughter all around him, he didn\u2019t care, <em>Draco</em> cared; Draco had put him in the velvet robes he was wearing and Draco had sent him here and now Draco had <em>left him</em>, and when he did turn up, Harry was going to punch him in the face and throw the most monstrous scene of his life.</p>\n<p>He finally ended up snagging a half-full bottle from one of the waiters and went and sat outside on the front steps, waiting for Draco to make his fashionably late grand appearance with his polished pureblood date on his arm. Harry jerked his tie loose savagely and swigged from the bottle whenever he stopped feeling drunk enough to be angry instead of miserable. The roar of the party rose and fell and rose behind him, and suddenly he was jerking up from half a doze for another gulp, only to find his bottle had run dry. Then he noticed a thin but steady stream of wizards and witches was going past him, down to waiting carriages and Floo stations, Apparating away into the night. He frowned muzzily at the departing crowd and then looked over his shoulder: they were the last to go. The music had stopped and the floor had emptied out, nothing left but scattered fragments of twinkly crystal and bits of confetti, the sparkle of drifting pixie dust, a handful of last drunken revelers closing down the bar.</p>\n<p>He stared blankly, still mostly drunk himself, and then it slowly penetrated\u2014the party was over. And Draco hadn\u2019t shown. Draco\u2014<em>hadn\u2019t</em> <em>come</em>. To the party of the year.</p>\n<p>Harry staggered up to his feet, nearly taking a header as he lurched down the stairs. He couldn\u2019t have Apparated without splinching himself monstrously, but there were a dozen broomsticks that people had abandoned at <em>Will Call</em> until the next morning, and he was past caring if he ran himself into a tree; he stole one and threw himself into the air, flew to Wiltshire in less than an hour, a flat-out sprint all the way, and came to a scrambling halt on the Manor drive, gravel spraying from under his feet.</p>\n<p>He dropped the broomstick and ran to the stables, panting\u2014it was past three, but the forge was still lit, dimly, and when he got inside, Draco was sitting at the workbench with the bits and pieces of some sort of clockwork box spread out over the surface.</p>\n<p>He wasn\u2019t really doing anything with it, just sitting silently in a chair, staring into the fire and moving a few of the pieces around with a finger. He was only in black trousers and a plain white shirt, rolled to the elbows and loose at the neck, not even tucked in. Harry took a step closer, and another, and then Draco slowly turned his head and stared at him.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t come,\u201d Harry said, his throat tight. Draco was looking at him like\u2014like\u2014</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s such a bore, really,\u201d Draco said. His voice trembled a little, steadied. \u201cI found I couldn\u2019t be bothered.\u201d</p>\n<p>#</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\n<img src=\"https://www.dropbox.com/s/cg1cz408t5v527y/Reparatio-invitation%202016-01-30%2013-16-04.png?raw=1\" alt=\"Mrs. Emmeline Fawley Garridge requests the honour of your company at the wedding of her great-great-great-grandson Harry James Potter to Mr. Draco Arcturus Black Malfoy Saturday, the ninth of June Two thousand and one at eleven o\u2019clock in the morning Malfoy Manor Wiltshire\">\n</p>\n<p>#</p>\n<p>\u201cAll right, are we sure we\u2019ve broken up all the potential murders?\u201d Harry said, rubbing his eyes. The seating chart covered the entire table.</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t care if we haven\u2019t, I refuse to look at it another second,\u201d Draco said. He had swung himself sideways over his chair and was draped over the arms in both directions, his head tipped back with his eyes closed. \u201cYou won\u2019t even let me snub anyone.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI can\u2019t afford to snub anyone!\u201d Harry said. \u201cI\u2019ve got a confirmation battle and an election to win in the next ten years.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t see why we can\u2019t just run off to Bali,\u201d Draco said sulkily. \u201cI think you\u2019re only marrying me for my connections.\u201d</p>"
