  "summary": "<p>Marinette is having a rough day when that night, when she's supposed to have a solo patrol, Chat Noir shows up asking a single question: \"Have you revealed your identity to anyone, accidentally or otherwise?\"</p>\n<p>Due to Popular Demand, I'm back with part 2! Were you wondering how Adrien was going to react? Wait no further ;)</p>\n<p>Also, this MIGHT turn into a three-parter. Might. Still trying to decide.</p>\n<p>Let me know if you'd like that.</p>",
  "notes": "<p>Little oneshot I thought up in response to all the similar prompts I'd seen. The difference is that I don't think Adrien would be stupid enough to just start dating some fake Ladybug. He'd ask her.</p>\n<p>(Original idea credited to @miraculous-of-salt's False Ladybug AU)</p>\n<p class=\"jump\">(See the end of the work for <a href=\"#work_endnotes\">more notes</a>.)</p>\n<p>\n(See the end of the chapter for <a href=\"#chapter_2_endnotes\">notes</a>.)\n</p>\n<p>Thank you so much for all the love and support on this. I can't even begin to describe how amazing everyone has been for this idea. I'm so overwhelmed by your comments. &lt;3</p>\n<p>Okay, so, I'm not usually one to bash on Alya, but I needed to in this. Because of reasons. It fit the feeling. I do love Alya tho. That girl is the bomb. I just wish she wasn't so short-sighted sometimes.</p>",
  "text": "<p>\u201cLadybug?\u201d</p>\n<p>Paris\u2019 spotted heroine jumped slightly after being pulled from her thoughts. She\u2019d been staring out over the city\u2019s glittering lights, lost to the maelstrom of voices and recalled memories swarming her mind with a thoughtful (at least she hoped it was) frown on her lips. So much so, that she hadn\u2019t noticed when her leather-clad partner had shown up to sit next to her on a night he was supposed to be taking off.</p>\n<p><em>When the hell had he gotten there?</em>\u00a0She wondered, looking around quickly for any indication of how long she\u2019d been stuck in her own head.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHey Chaton, what are you doing out here? It\u2019s my night to patrol.\u201d She asked as another entirely panicked thought came to mind - that she\u2019d been so dazed she\u2019d missed the tell-tale signs of an Akuma.</p>\n<p>But, before she could freak out any further, she took in Chat\u2019s relative ease - or at least, he didn\u2019t look like he was on the verge of jumping into a fight. He did seem apprehensive, though. She could tell in the way it tensed and squeezed his shoulders together like he wanted to be close, but wouldn\u2019t dare come in contact with her.</p>\n<p>Which made her wonder if she\u2019d said or done anything recently to give him the idea he was overstepping his bounds. Or maybe he was mad at her for something? And wasn\u2019t that just the icing on the cake that was her day?\u00a0</p>\n<p>First, Lila had caused a major scene that got Marinette detention for the rest of the week (it all happened so fast, she barely remembers what the hell had even happened). Now she was having a panic attack over whether her partner was mad at her for something she didn\u2019t remember doing? Who else was she going to piss off today?</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your stance on sharing your identity?\u201d</p>\n<p>Panic attack on momentary pause, a dark brow shot up at the question, and if she wasn\u2019t so wary of the way he\u2019d said it with that uncomfortable look on his face, she probably would have been angry. But he seemed so off tonight that it was throwing her usual emotions for a loop. So, choosing not to go off on her partner, she sighed heavily, trying to keep her focus on him despite the bubbling irritation,\u00a0\u201cChat, I\u2019m sorry, but we\u2019ve talked about this. Our identities are a secret for a reason.\u201d</p>\n<p>For the first time since he sat down (she thinks), she sees him glance her way if only slightly. The uncomfortable look on his face had softened a bit but he still has something unreadable in his eyes that makes Ladybug anxious,\u00a0\u201cSo... you\u2019ve never shared your identity? With anyone? Not accidentally or otherwise?\u201d</p>\n<p>If she didn\u2019t know any better, she\u2019d say his words were a little accusatory.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Which, okay first off, what the fuck? And second, why was he suddenly giving her the third degree?\u00a0</p>\n<p>Again, though, the entire display was throwing her and she knew she had to be rational about this.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNo. Of course not. I promised you didn\u2019t I? Once Hawkmoth was defeated, you would be the first person I told.\u201d She stated as calmly and resolutely as she possibly can. She\u2019d been clear from the start where she stood on the subject.\u00a0</p>\n<p>As soon as the words left her mouth, Chat Noir visibly relaxed. Shoulders slumping and a breath heaving from his chest as he nodded,\u00a0\u201cRight. Right, of course.\u201d He finally managed to turn to look at her and the discomfort was quickly hidden by a small smile.</p>\n<p>The shift in his attitude was almost as disconcerting as his arrival.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat is this about, Chatton?\u201d</p>\n<p>That smile faltered a bit as he looked away from her again,\u00a0\u201cThere\u2019s this-\u201d he began but his words died before he shook his head,\u00a0\u201cNo, it\u2019s - it\u2019s nothing. Sorry for bothering you about this. It was stupid.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Chat made to stand, but Ladybug caught his wrist before he could get away,\u00a0\u201cObviously not if it brought you out here as upset as you looked. I know I can be a real stickler about the secret identities thing, but Chat, I\u2019m not doing this to hurt you. I promise!\u201d She implored, feeling like she\u2019d missed something major.\u00a0\u201cIf you\u2019re being hurt or-\u201d</p>\n<p>Blonde hair flew as he shook his head quickly,\u00a0\u201cNo, no. Nothing like that. Really. I know why you do. I won\u2019t pretend it doesn\u2019t suck, but I get it. Really, I do.\u201d He tried to assure her, and while it did seem like he understood and he was being honest with her, he was still hiding something. Something that had driven him to come out and ask her these strange questions.</p>\n<p>\u201cThen what was all of this about?\u201d</p>\n<p>He had the decency to look apologetic at least as the corners of his mouth pulled up and he shook his head again,\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s too personal - talking about it might give me away, Bugaboo, but I really am sorry about this. I didn\u2019t mean to upset you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Ladybug\u2019s eyes darted back and forth as she watched him closely, but eventually, hesitantly, she let go of his wrist and allowed him to get up.</p>\n<p>The whole conversation left an unsettling anxiousness over her and a rather uncomfortable tenseness in the air between them as he backed away and saluted before she even had the chance to say anything - disappearing into the night.</p>\n<p>That unease followed her home and through her restless sleep and when she woke up the next morning, she couldn\u2019t help but let it consume her thoughts. Distracting her as she made her way to class earlier than usual.</p>\n<p>Distracting her so much, in fact, that she almost didn\u2019t notice the crowd gathered around two individuals crammed into her usual seat next to Alya giggling and talking loudly.</p>\n<p>Almost.</p>\n<p>As much as she hated it, Marinette had developed something of a sixth sense for the Italian exchange student Lila Rossi. A personal radar to warn her of the liar\u2019s presence.</p>\n<p>And it was going off big time.</p>\n<p>It wasn\u2019t uncommon for Lila to try and steal her spot when she could. Usually, it resulted in some sort of argument between Marinette and Alya when her supposed best friend defended the other girl for just wanting to hang out, and why didn\u2019t she try being nice to the girl for once?</p>\n<p>This time, though, Marinette was quickly made aware of three things:</p>\n<p>1. Lila wasn\u2019t alone.</p>\n<p>2. Whoever this other girl was, she and Lila were already very close and that didn\u2019t bode well for anyone - especially Marinette.</p>\n<p>3. Adrien, who was an unfortunate captive in the crowd around his desk, looked really uncomfortable - more so than usual as he openly frowned at the desktop in front of him, trying not to associate with the things going on around him.</p>\n<p>What the hell was going on? Marinette had only been gone from class for one afternoon!\u00a0</p>\n<p>Alya was the first to notice her entrance to the class, giving her an unsure look from her seat (she had been pretty mad at her yesterday for whatever it was that landed her detention for the week), causing a ripple effect as Lila and her\u00a0\u2018guest\u2019 looked up at her too, quieting down and catching everyone else\u2019 attention.</p>\n<p>The unfamiliar girl sized the noirette up before speaking,\u00a0\u201cIs this the girl you were telling me about?\u201d</p>\n<p>Lila put on her biggest, fakest, puppy-dog eyes and nodded softly, watching Marinette like she might lunge at her any second now.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Like parting the red sea, the unfamiliar girl stood from her place at Marinette\u2019s desk and the crowd around her gave her room to move, allowing her to make her way to stand haughtily before her. The girl was a tad taller than Marinette, but the platform sandals she wore made it so Marinette would need to look up at her slightly. She had dark, almost black, shoulder-length hair that hung loosely, but the color of her brows made it clear that it wasn\u2019t natural. She\u2019d dyed it, recently too, if the lack of root discoloration was any indication.</p>\n<p>Marinette watched her approach with a raised brow, unimpressed by the superior gleam to the girl\u2019s blue-green eyes.</p>\n<p>\u201cI heard you\u2019ve been bullying my best friend.\u201d She said, authoritatively, her hands propped on hips clad in\u00a0<em>Gabriel</em>\u00a0branded jeans.</p>\n<p>There was a collective gasp among her classmates like this was some big reveal in a soap opera.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The class rep merely blinked a moment, brow still raised because who the fuck even was this girl and why was she squaring up to her like she even had a chance? Actually, no, she didn\u2019t care.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, who are you?\u201d Marinette asked, but her tone gave away how few fucks she actually gave about the girl\u2019s answer.</p>\n<p>\u201cFor your information, it\u2019s Bianca. I just transferred yesterday. But don\u2019t change the subject. I\u2019ve heard that you\u2019ve been bullying my best friend Lila.\u201d</p>\n<p>Before Bianca had a chance to say any more, Marinette gave her a deadpanned look,\u00a0\u201cWell, sorry to inform you, but your best friend is a liar.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lila could immediately be heard breaking out into sobs somewhere in the background but Marinette was quickly losing interest in this conversation.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t think she is. I think you\u2019re the liar. In fact, I think people like you are what\u2019s wrong with Paris. Always trying to hurt others so they get Akumatized and I have to clean up your mess.\u201d</p>\n<p>\n<em>I\u2019m sorry, what?\u00a0</em>\n</p>\n<p>That had Bluebell eyes snapping to focus on the girl in front of her. Interest piqued.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m giving you one chance. Stop being a menace to society or\u00a0<em>my partner</em>\u00a0and I will take action.\u201d</p>\n<p>There was quite a bit to unpack from that. Like... a lot. Menace to society? Partner? Take action?</p>\n<p>Who did this girl think she was?\u00a0<em>Ladybug?</em></p>\n<p>The one thing that seemed clear to Marinette after reviewing the word choices in her own head a few times, was that this was not a friendly recommendation.</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you threatening me?\u201d</p>\n<p>She probably should have sounded a little angrier. In fact, anything would have been better than bored. But she just couldn\u2019t find the energy.\u00a0</p>\n<p>A triumphant smile spread over Bianca\u2019s face, as she disregarded the lack of fear in Marinette\u2019s voice,\u00a0\u201cI don\u2019t threaten people. But that is a promise.\u201d</p>\n<p>Marinette was left to blink at her a little longer.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Because what even was happening here? What on earth had she done that the universe saw fit to drop this steaming pile of bull on her morning?</p>\n<p>And why did it feel like the girl was hinting at something she wasn\u2019t picking up on? Why was her body telling her that she needed to react while her brain was taking its sweet time to catch up with everything?</p>\n<p>\u201cDude,\u201d someone from the peanut gallery stage whispered, finding it in their heart to give her a helping hand,\u00a0\u201cThat\u2019s Ladybug!\u201d</p>\n<p>Lila shushed them loudly,\u00a0\u201cGuys, not everyone is supposed to know! We don\u2019t know who we can trust!\u201d</p>\n<p>\n<em>Oh.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>oohhhhh!</em>\n</p>\n<p>Wow. When she\u2019d made that comment in her head before, she\u2019d been joking but... seriously? Did she really just?</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re Ladybug?\u201d Marinette asked, wanting to clarify and make absolutely certain that she hadn\u2019t just imagined that last forty-five seconds of her life.</p>\n<p>Bianca\u2019s chin raised, literally looking down her nose at Marinette,\u00a0\u201cNormally I wouldn\u2019t share that information with someone like you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Behind her, Adrien stood from his seat looking absolutely livid, but Marinette barely had a moment to even register the malice in the gaze he pointed at Bianca before -\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em>Pfft...</em>\n</p>\n<p>Marinette covered her mouth with her hand to stop it, but nothing could hold back the onslaught now.\u00a0</p>\n<p>They were giggles at first, tumbling from her in waves as she tried to clear her throat and treat this seriously. But before long, she couldn\u2019t help it. She was laughing out loud, doubling over, completely ignorant (maybe not completely, but she didn\u2019t care at this point) to the looks of confusion on the faces around her.</p>\n<p>She made the mistake of looking back up at Bianca and that only renewed her laughing fit until it literally brought her to her knees, clutching her sides as she laughed so hard she cried.</p>\n<p>\n<em>Fucking cried.</em>\n</p>\n<p>It was a solid five or six minutes before she could breathe again. Sitting back up, wiping the tears from her eyes, she beamed at the girl standing awkwardly before her,\u00a0\u201cWow. Thanks. I really needed that.\u201d</p>\n<p>She cleared her throat, clearly unsure of the strange behavior. She couldn\u2019t blame her for that. \u201cI don\u2019t see what\u2019s so funny.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAll of it. Really.\u201d She stood up from the floor, making a show of dusting off her pants before turning her full attention back on the girl.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Because this was going to be fun.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo, Ladybug, tell me this; if I\u2019m such a menace to society, why would you entrust me with a miraculous?\u201d</p>\n<p>Bianca's smirk faltered, her eyes darting over to Lila for a moment, both of them looking a little lost for words. As was everyone else for that matter.</p>\n<p>Even Alya, whose mouth hung open at this revelation. But the reporter flew to her phone, swiping quickly, \"when?! There were no new heroes! How do we know you're not lying?\"</p>\n<p>Oh good. They were playing right into it. One thing you could always count on with sheeple... they always follow.</p>\n<p>\"Huh, well, then I guess if you can\u2019t believe me at my word, it would be pretty easy to fact check.\" Her tone was a bit forced on those words and the reporter had the decency to look taken aback, \"You could always just ask Ladybug, here.\"</p>\n<p>\"Well I-\"</p>\n<p>\"Or you could ask her\u00a0<em>partner</em>. Seeing as how he saw me transform.\"</p>\n<p>Bianca's mouth snapped shut. It was still hit or miss whether or not Marinette was bluffing. And it's easy to claim something like that when the only other person who could confirm or deny the facts was not present.</p>\n<p>This had been Lila\u2019s game the whole time. The difference was, Marinette wasn\u2019t lying.</p>\n<p>But neither of them could take that chance.</p>\n<p>Because neither of them knew what she knew.</p>\n<p>And Ladybug was definitely in this room, but it wasn\u2019t who they all thought it was.</p>\n<p>\"I asked her to give you a chance. Because I wanted to help you. I thought being a hero would make you a better person. But you just kept bullying me!\"</p>\n<p>\"E-exactly.\"</p>\n<p>Ah, so they were going to go this route, hmm? She could work with that. And given Lila\u2019s proclivity for being Akumatized, maybe she could mess with Hawkmoth too while she was at it.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Because it was only a matter of time before\u00a0<em>someone</em>\u00a0was targeted.</p>\n<p>\"How very generous of you, Lila,\" She said in her sweetest voice possible, but even to her own ears, it sounded fake. How did Lila keep this up all the time?\u00a0\u201cBut, that\u2019s not what you said on the tower when we fought that Akuma together.\u201d</p>\n<p>\"What did you think I would say when you were obviously unfit to be a Hero! I didn\u2019t want to risk you turning on me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t think I was unfit when I helped save you and Chat Noir.\u201d This time, it felt a little more realistic when she put the hurt look on her face, glancing away.</p>\n<p>In the process, she caught sight of Adrien giving her a strange look. One she couldn\u2019t really put a name to. But it was different than all of her other classmates. Why did he seem so much more confused than the others?\u00a0</p>\n<p>The girl scoffed, \"leave my partner out of this.\" She demanded, and it felt like a desperate attempt at redirecting the conversation.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Fine. She could work with that too.</p>\n<p>\"You... do know that your 'partner' is my best friend, right?\" She turned an apologetic look to Alya she only half meant, \"sorry Als, but - you know,\" Marinette pointed between the two of them indicating the distance that had grown between them. They weren't nearly as close as they'd used to be. And while they were still friends, Marinette had a hard time categorizing her as her 'best friend'.</p>\n<p>And the implication wasn't wasted on the reporter either. She was left staring wide with bewilderment and hurt. But Marinette was less positive it was because of not being best friends anymore and more that she hadn't told Alya that she spent time with one of the heroes she loved to chase.</p>\n<p>\"My partner would never hang out with someone like you.\"</p>\n<p>God, she was just a broken record, wasn\u2019t she? Did she really still think she was bluffing?</p>\n<p>With a scoff and a soft shake of her head, Marinette pulled her phone from her pocket and swiped through her pictures until she found what she was looking for.</p>\n<p>She wasnt trying to be smug about the way she flipped her phone around so she could show the class, but she definitely couldn't help the little smirk that pulled at her lips as the class gasped again, pulling closer so they could study the photo.</p>\n<p>A photo of her and Chat Noir sitting a little too close together on her chaise lounge. Marinette sticking her tongue out at the camera, while chat gave the overly kawaii victory peace sign over his left eye like he was straight out of an anime. It was one of her favorites. They'd spent nearly the whole night binging on shows together after a particularly stressful day. The pictures had been a side effect of too much sugar, not enough sleep, and good company. And for some reason when Chat found out she\u2019d been Multimouse, that increased her\u00a0\u2018coolness factor\u2019 and they had something in common.</p>\n<p>Of course, she couldn\u2019t tell him that wasn\u2019t the only thing they had in common.</p>\n<p>Either way, it had brought them closer together as friends and they hung out often.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Which was a reprieve given that most of her friends had abandoned her anyway.\u00a0</p>\n<p>As Bianca stared a little blankly at the picture, a number of voices all began to pick up around them.</p>\n<p>\"You're actually friends with chat noir? That's so cool!\"</p>\n<p>\u201cDoes that mean you hang out with the other heroes too?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat is Chat Noir really like?\u201d</p>\n<p>\"Wait, then that means you really were a hero? I thought heroes had to keep their identities secret.\"</p>\n<p>That\u2019s the one she\u2019d been waiting on. Quickly silencing the others with a pointed look back at Bianca,\u00a0\"They do. But I'm not a hero anymore, am I Ladybug?\"</p>\n<p>\"I-I...\"</p>\n<p>\"Why was it again that I\u2019m not allowed to be Multimouse again?\" She put a thoughtful finger to her chin, but she felt her own fire building in her core,\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure it was nothing to do with being a menace to society.\u201d</p>\n<p>She tapped her chin a few more times, looking around\u00a0<em>deep in thought</em>. Catching another glimpse of Adrien studying her carefully, but she refused to let his perfectness distract her because fuck these people.</p>\n<p>Fuck the high road.</p>\n<p>If he was going to be mad at her for standing up for her alter-ego then fuck him too.</p>\n<p>But he didn\u2019t seem mad.\u00a0</p>\n<p>In fact, as soon as she locked eyes with him, a slight smirk pulled at his lips. It was roguish and totally out of place on his angelic face, but goddamn did it do things for her.</p>\n<p>But the smirk paired with the slightly raised brow aimed at her said,\u00a0\u2018Yes, what\u00a0<em>did\u00a0</em>Ladybug say?\u2019</p>\n<p>It\u2019s sarcastic and playful and familiar in ways her heart is not ready to admit.</p>\n<p>But that would have to come later.</p>\n<p>Marinette spun back to the imposter, narrowing her eyes dangerously, \"Oh right! Because I'd accidentally revealed my identity to Chat Noir. Because identities are supposed to remain a secret.\"</p>\n<p>\"W-well th-there are exceptions!\" Bianca tries to defend, but Marinette isn\u2019t going to let her.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, I think you, just like your supposed best friend, are a liar. You\u2019re not Ladybug. You don\u2019t know a damn thing about Ladybug. Because if you were, you\u2019d already have been beaten. You\u2019ve been in this classroom all of what, one day? And the entire class already knows your\u00a0\u2018identity\u2019? We\u2019re all lucky you aren\u2019t one of the heroes, otherwise, Hawkmoth would already have won!\u201d</p>\n<p>She was fuming now. All of the emotions finally catching up with her. She thrust an accusatory finger at Bianca, making the girl stumble back slightly,\u00a0\u201cYou don\u2019t know a damn thing about what it takes to be a hero. What they have to sacrifice to keep people safe. Besides, Ladybug and Chat Noir don\u2019t even know each other's identities - why the hell would\u00a0<em>Ladybug</em>\u00a0share something like that with a classroom full of people who\u2019ve been Akumatized at least once and not share that with her own partner?!\u201d</p>\n<p>Whatever fear she\u2019d instilled in the new girl quickly swapped for something much closer to fury as she reclaimed her balance and advanced on Marinette with a fire burning in her eyes.\u00a0\u201cHow dare you call me a liar, you little fucking brat!\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Surprised at the outburst, Marinette didn\u2019t move when she saw Bianca raise her hand to strike her, instead, closing her eyes and bracing for the blow.</p>\n<p>A blow that never connected.\u00a0</p>\n<p>A gasp brought Marinette to peak open her eyes before they widened at the scene.</p>\n<p>Bianca stood where she had previously, hand raised and poised to strike. But just behind her, Adrien had moved - impossibly quick, seriously when the hell had she gotten up? - and grabbed the girl\u2019s arm, hand clutching tightly at her, keeping her still.</p>\n<p>\u201cA-Adrien!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s enough.\u201d He hissed at her, voice low and threatening.\u00a0\u201cIf it wasn\u2019t clear before, it definitely is now. You\u2019re not Ladybug. She would never raise a hand to a civilian like that!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cB-but - !\u201d Lila tried to come to her\u00a0\u2018friend\u2019s\u2019 defense but was silenced when he shot her an equally terrifying look.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve had enough of you trying to turn everyone against Marinette. I knew you both were lying when you\u00a0\u2018accidentally\u2019 revealed Ladybug\u2019s identity to me yesterday, but I didn\u2019t have proof to prove it. You\u2019ve been lying to everyone about everything!\u201d</p>\n<p>Wait... The way he\u2019d said accidentally... why did it seem so familiar?\u00a0</p>\n<p>Her thoughts of the blonde-haired, green-eyed model were very suddenly replaced with thoughts of a similarly blonde-haired, green-eyed superhero who\u2019d come looking for her on his night off, asking if she\u2019d ever\u00a0\u2018revealed herself, accidentally or otherwise\u2019.</p>\n<p>\u201cAdrien! Y-you\u2019re hurting me!\u201d</p>\n<p>Marinette\u2019s eyes were drawn to the boy\u2019s hand, still tightly clutching Bianca\u2019s in a vice grip that would likely leave bruises.</p>\n<p>But that\u2019s not what she was focused on. Instead, it was the familiar shape of his silver ring that drew her eye. Familiar because she\u2019d seen him wear it since the first day she\u2019d met him and never took it off.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Except for the day they\u2019d done the shoot for her website.</p>\n<p>\n<em>The day she and Chat had to switch Miraculouses.</em>\n</p>\n<p>Adrien.</p>\n<p>Adrien was Chat Noir.</p>\n<p>Her kitty had been there the entire time.</p>\n<p>That\u2019s why he\u2019d been so angry. That\u2019s why he\u2019d looked so upset. That\u2019s why he\u2019d come looking for her and asking such strange questions!</p>\n<p>Because Lila and her lackey had chosen the one person who\u2019d know for a fact that they were lying.</p>\n<p>And if she thought she couldn\u2019t love him any more than she already did, she was\u00a0<em>sorely</em>\u00a0mistaken.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat is going on in here?!\u201d</p>\n<p>Great. of course the teacher would walk in then.</p>\n<p>She didn\u2019t pay much attention to the chaos that ensued after Madame Bustier had walked in the room. Lila and Bianca had claimed Marinette attacked and Adrien had stepped in to help her and they were both sent to the hall because a number of people started speaking up and coming to their defense, suddenly not blinded by Lila\u2019s lies any longer.</p>\n<p>But now, she was standing in the hall next to her crush and\u00a0<em>her partner</em>.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry Marinette.\u201d</p>\n<p>Her thoughts came to a startling halt as she turned wide eyes on him.</p>\n<p>\u201cI shouldn\u2019t have ever told you not to call her out. I was stupid. I just hope you\u2019ll forgive me someday.\u201d</p>\n<p>Marinette couldn\u2019t help the smile that pulled at her lips, because how could she not have noticed? Model or not, that was the heart of her partner beating in that beautiful body of his.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing to forgive, Adrien. Besides, at least you checked your sources.\u201d She chuckled, finding so much irony in that statement. If he hadn\u2019t come looking for her, she probably wouldn\u2019t have put it together.</p>\n<p>He turned a confused look on her.</p>\n<p>The smile she turned on him in return was brighter than she\u2019d given anyone in some time,\u00a0\u201cI told you, didn\u2019t I? You\u2019d be the first to know.\u201d</p>\n<p>\n<b>\n<em>Adrien.exe has stopped working.</em>\n</b>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>\n<em>Your Adrien ran into a problem and needs to restart.

Not really. And Marinette wasn\u2019t the type of person to \u2018fake\u2019 being nice just so she could get away with bullying someone else. Marinette wasn\u2019t a bully, </span>\n<em>\n<span>period</span>\n</em>\n<span>.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>And okay, maybe he didn\u2019t know Marinette all that well, at least as Adrien, but he knew her well enough as Chat Noir to know that the only change in character around here worth being worried over was the addition of a liar to their class hell-bent on making things miserable.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>This was really getting out of hand.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>He\u2019d recommended Marinette to take the high road because, at the time, it had been harmless white lies. Things meant to make the new girl look more important than she actually was. Some misguided attempt to make friends in a new place. He could sympathize with that.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Sure, some of the lies were maybe not as harmless - claiming to be Ladybug\u2019s best friend was just asking for trouble, but he was sure </span>\n<em>\n<span>that</span>\n</em>\n<span> one was going to come back to bite her quickly enough that she\u2019d learn that maybe putting herself on blast when a magical terrorist was out there, </span>\n<em>\n<span>was a bad idea</span>\n</em>\n<span>.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>\n<em>12% Complete</em>\n</b>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHey, Adrien!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Inwardly, the model had groaned, suppressing an eye roll as best he could.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<span>Speak of the devil and she shall appear.</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>This wasn\u2019t how he\u2019d wanted to spend his rare lunch at school - fielding drama from none other than the resident liar herself. But, before he\u2019d been able to make a move, take a bite, pick up a book - anything to indicate he was too busy to give her the time of day, Lila Rossi had placed herself directly in his space on the bench next to him, cuddling up way too close to be considered anything but sexual harassment.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThere\u2019s someone I\u2019d like you to meet!\u201d she\u2019d sung a little too happily - especially given the civil war she\u2019d caused in the classroom.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>If Adrien hadn\u2019t been so focused on the </span>\n<em>\n<span>\u2018Bad touch!

It\u2019s nice to meet you.\u201d The unfamiliar girl smiled, something in her eyes flashing something that he caught, but couldn\u2019t really understand, \u201cWell, officially, at least.\u201d She chuckled to herself at some sort of personal joke.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The model eyed the girl for a while.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>She didn\u2019t look familiar.

She\u2019s just transferred into our class today from another school.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Ah. So Lila was trying to corrupt them as they came in now?</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Great. He could only hope this one would be quick to see the lies for what they were.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cJust transferred, huh?\u201d He tried to sound interested - because, despite Lila, this girl had done nothing to warrant his ire, and he wasn\u2019t about to drive her any further into Lila\u2019s clutches if he could help it. \u201cWhere are you from originally?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHere, actually. I\u2019m from Paris. I was just at another school in the city. But something about this school made me want to transfer.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Was that a meaningful look she was giving him? She was putting a lot of unspoken emphasis behind her words that he wasn't really making a whole lot of sense of, \u201cOh yeah? Like what?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Her smile broadened at being asked, \u201cWell my best friend, for one.\u201d She gestured to Lila with a look he\u2019d only ever seen Alya give Marinette when they\u2019d been the bestest of best friends. \u201cLila and I have been besties for a long time.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>\n<em>25% Complete</em>\n</b>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<span>Oh.</span>\n</em>\n<span>\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Well... that could either spell the end of all the stupid drama in the class as Lila had a \u2018true friend\u2019 to spend time with or could be the beginning of something far worse.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Though, something deep down told him it was the latter.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Bianca studied him for a moment, looking between him and Lila who was still uncomfortably close, seeming torn about something before she sighed, \u201cLook, I\u2019m not really supposed to do this, but I wanted to apologize.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cBianca! We talked about this!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>He looked between the two of them, watching as they had some sort of unspoken conversation.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNo, Lila. It wasn\u2019t right. I have to.\u201d Bianca gave her \u2018bestie\u2019 a stern look before she turned back to him, \u201cAdrien, one of the last times you and I,\u201d her eyes trailed away for a moment as if literally looking for the right words to say, \u201c</span>\n<em>\n<span>met</span>\n</em>\n<span> - I acted really immaturely and said something I didn\u2019t mean. And I wanted to apologize for that.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Okay - now he was really lost.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Because in no way did his memory include a confrontation with this girl. He may not remember every face and name, but he remembered confrontation. Mainly because of how often he tried to avoid it if possible.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>So what on earth was this girl talking about?</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>His confusion must have been written all over his face because she looked around to check for something before getting closer and dropping her voice, \u201cYou know - the park? I... I called Lila out saying we weren\u2019t friends?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>That sounded familiar. His brain was working double-time to pick up what she was laying down for him. And it was not being very helpful.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>He definitely remembered a confrontation happening like that. Someone had come to discredit Lila about being their best friend as well as a lie about being a superhero.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>But that hadn\u2019t been this girl.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>That had been -\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<span>No.</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>\n<em>30% Complete</em>\n</b>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Understanding registered in his gaze, eyes widening slightly, making the girl - </span>\n<em>\n<span>Bianca</span>\n</em>\n<span> - chuckle, \u201cFigure it out? I guess it </span>\n<em>\n<span>is </span>\n</em>\n<span>a little hard to recognize me, huh?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>So many emotions whirled up on him at that moment.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Sure - there was that little traitorous part of him that was immediately elated. Because maybe this was his Lady - there were only three people (that he knew of) who knew about what had happened in the park that day. And maybe this meant -\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>But just as quickly as joy had filled his chest, so did a foreboding sense of distrust and betrayal. Because if that really was Ladybug who stood before him unmasked - she\u2019d broken her own golden rule. She\u2019d shared her identity with </span>\n<em>\n<span>him</span>\n</em>\n<span>. Not </span>\n<em>\n<span>Chat Noir</span>\n</em>\n<span>. And while they were the same person, Ladybug had promised Chat would be the first to know her identity. And this wasn\u2019t exactly what he\u2019d always pictured when he would eventually (hopefully) find out.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>They hadn\u2019t defeated Hawkmoth.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>This was not a moment of celebration between the partners who\u2019d sacrificed so much for the safety of the city.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>And never ever in his dreams of their reveal, was Lila Rossi </span>\n<em>\n<span>ever</span>\n</em>\n<span> present.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Not to mention, Ladybug had made it abundantly clear how much she distrusted Lila. And okay, fine, maybe someone </span>\n<em>\n<span>could</span>\n</em>\n<span> chalk that whole thing up to a spat between friends, but that wasn\u2019t like his lady at all.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>At least... he didn\u2019t think so.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>It wasn\u2019t what he\u2019d come to know of her. She did some things that were maybe a little questionable sometimes, but so did he. But taking out her frustration on a friend using her powers? That wasn\u2019t like the Ladybug he knew.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>And Lila had made it clear she wasn\u2019t a fan of Ladybug either.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Something was </span>\n<em>\n<span>very</span>\n</em>\n<span> wrong here.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Either he didn\u2019t know Ladybug nearly as well as he\u2019d thought, or this was not Ladybug.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\"Like I said though, I'm not really supposed to be saying this.\" Her words had brought him out of his thoughts and back to reality as he watched her wink and put a finger to her lips.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThen why did you?\u201d Adrien found himself asking because he could not confirm or deny anything yet. He couldn\u2019t trust his mouth to not say the things clouding his head.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cBecause I trust you, and I wanted to clear the air.\u201d She answered simply.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>\n<em>35% Complete</em>\n</b>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Apparently, that </span>\n<em>\n<span>trust</span>\n</em>\n<span> was extremely cheap to attain, because most if not all of the rest of his classmates knew before the end of the day. He would hear them whispering in lulls during class, hushed mentions of \u2018Ladybug\u2019 spreading like wildfire around the room.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Which had only soured his mood further.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>It wasn\u2019t like he minded if she shared her identity with people she trusted - but if this was the real Ladybug, she hadn\u2019t spoken a peep of this to Chat Noir. And there was that little voice in the back of his head constantly droning on and on about how this meant that he was nothing more than a sidekick to her.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>She didn\u2019t trust him.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>He didn\u2019t actually know her the way he thought.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>And lastly, but probably the most distressing: </span>\n<em>\n<span>Ladybug is a liar.</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>But he kept pushing those thoughts away in the hopes that this </span>\n<em>\n<span>wasn\u2019t</span>\n</em>\n<span> his lady. She wouldn\u2019t actually do something like this. She wouldn\u2019t discard him like this.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>He had to believe that.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>He had to trust that the Ladybug he had come to know was the truth.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>That\u2019s how he\u2019d come to the decision to drop in on her during her solo patrol.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>To ask her point-blank.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>\n<em>40% Complete</em>\n</b>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cLadybug?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Paris\u2019 spotted heroine jumped slightly after being pulled from her thoughts. Her head whipped around quickly after seeing him sit next to her, looking out around them for something. Probably trying to figure out how long she\u2019d been zoning out for.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Which was a while, actually, and on any other night and with literally anything else on his mind, he probably would have said something about it.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHey Chaton, what are you doing out here? It\u2019s my night to patrol.\u201d She asked, surprise filling her face and tone.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Was this Bianca Esposito he was sitting next to? He found that he couldn\u2019t look at her right away. He couldn\u2019t look at her at all. And the build-up of anger and unease about this confrontation from the day made it hard to be in her presence.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>But he had to confirm it. \u201cWhat\u2019s your stance on sharing your identity?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>For a moment, out of the corner of his eye, he saw her tense up and her face clouded with something close to anger herself. But after a moment of watching him, she\u2019d quickly swallowed that back and took a deep breath, \u201cChat, I\u2019m sorry, but we\u2019ve talked about this. Our identities are a secret for a reason.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>That sounded a lot more like the Ladybug he knew. He glanced her way, catching her staring at him. He was being unfairly suspicious of her. He knew that, but he\u2019d been fighting those daunting thoughts all day that she wanted nothing to do with him and it was hard to immediately drop that. \u201cSo\u2026 you\u2019ve never shared your identity? With anyone? Not accidentally or otherwise?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>A raised brow shot at him and maybe a little hurt in her own gaze as she stared back, \u201cNo. Of course not. I promised you didn\u2019t I? Once Hawkmoth was defeated, you would be the first person I told.\u201d She stated calmly and resolutely.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>\n<em>43% Complete</em>\n</b>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>As soon as the words left her mouth, Chat Noir felt himself relax fully. Shoulders slumping and a breath heaving from his chest as he nodded, \u201cRight. Right, of course.\u201d He finally managed to turn to look at her and the discomfort was quickly hidden by a small smile.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>He\u2019d been such an ass to her. And he felt so bad for being suspicious but this had been something he needed to tackle head-on at the source.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhat is this about, Chaton?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>That smile faltered a bit as he looked away from her again, \u201cThere\u2019s this-\u201d he began but his words died before he shook his head, \u201cNo, it\u2019s - it\u2019s nothing. Sorry for bothering you about this. It was stupid.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Because it was. Why would he have ever believed anything Lila or anyone calling themselves her \u2018bestie\u2019 said over his partner?</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>He\u2019d let them get to him.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>\n<em>45% Complete</em>\n</b>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Now the big question was what he was going to do about it. Because something had to be done. But he couldn\u2019t risk exposing himself or Ladybug in the process.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Chat made to stand, but Ladybug caught his wrist before he could get away, \u201cObviously not if it brought you out here as upset as you looked. I know I can be a real stickler about the secret identity thing, but Chat, I\u2019m not doing this to hurt you. I promise!\u201d She implored, and if that didn\u2019t just break his heart for making her think she\u2019d done anything wrong. \u201cIf you\u2019re being hurt or-\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Blonde hair flew as he shook his head quickly, \u201cNo, no. Nothing like that. Really. I know why you do. I won\u2019t pretend it doesn\u2019t suck, but I get it. Really, I do.\u201d He tried to assure her, but he knew he was doing a terrible job. It had been such a long and emotionally draining day. He needed some time to come up with the right way to make it up to her.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThen what was all of this about?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>He gave her the most apologetic look he could muster, the corners of his mouth pulling up as he shook his head again, \u201cIt\u2019s too personal - talking about it might give me away, Bugaboo, but I really am sorry about this. I didn\u2019t mean to upset you.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Ladybug\u2019s eyes darted back and forth as she watched him closely, but eventually, hesitantly, she had let go of his wrist and allowed him to get up and make a quick escape.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Something he hated to have to do. And the guilt ate at him the rest of the night, making it near impossible to sleep. So he\u2019d tried putting his mind to better uses - coming up with ways he could disprove the fake Ladybug before things got out of hand.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Because he knew they would.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>\n<em>50% Complete</em>\n</b>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The next morning was tiptoeing somewhere close to \u201cterrible day\u201d real quick and he\u2019d only been in class for fifteen minutes.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>It had taken all of three minutes of entering the classroom for Lila and her \u2018bestie\u2019 to proffer the seat behind him like they owned the place and start holding court.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>For every student that entered, he found another obstacle blocking his ability to get up from his seat and escape - until he was literally trapped there; listening to the liar and the fake reminisce over their friendship and answering all the questions their classmates hurled at them.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>All the while, Adrien was becoming increasingly angry.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Because </span>\n<em>\n<span>how dare they</span>\n</em>\n<span>?</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>That was his partner they were lying about!\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>And listening in only made him angrier. So angry, in fact, he\u2019d been shocked when that anger didn\u2019t earn him a black butterfly.

That\u2019s\u2026 that\u2019s not what he\u2019d expected her to say.

He\u2019d been the only one (besides the real Ladybug) who\u2019d seen her detransform.

Even when he came to talk to her about it a few days later, she didn\u2019t say a whole lot about being a hero - he\u2019d practically had to coax her reaction out of her!</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>So why now?

Cool.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Now if only he could do the other two things, he\u2019d be set!</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Marinette watched him with a strange (read: </span>\n<em>\n<span>adorable</span>\n</em>\n<span>) mixture of amusement and concern that had her biting her bottom lip and pulling it into her mouth while she watched and waited for him to react. Probably to keep herself from laughing at him. And he should feel </span>\n<em>\n<span>some </span>\n</em>\n<span>way about that, but he couldn\u2019t stop staring at her lips and wanting to be the one biting them and -\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<span>AND BREATHE DAMMIT.</span>\n</em>\n<span>\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Oh right.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>He\u2019s supposed to be doing that thing.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Giving in to the screaming need for oxygen, Adrien sucked in a deep breath, allowing for it to slowly ease back out of his mouth as he continued to watch his classmate with wide, unblinking eyes that were really starting to sting and water.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>As he\u2019d reached the end of his exhale, though, his voice began to function again as little breathy chuckles started to escape him. A smile had begun to grow over his lips and as the chuckles turned to giggles and full-on laughter, and his eyes watered more, he was </span>\n<em>\n<span>beaming</span>\n</em>\n<span> as he clutched at his sides.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>He was smiling so large in his laughing fit there was no reason for his eyes to be watering this much - oh no, those are </span>\n<em>\n<span>tears</span>\n</em>\n<span>.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>And he was shaking. And not because he was laughing.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The laughter didn\u2019t petter off though, even when he swung around and gathered the girl in his arms, lifting her up, and spinning them both around in the empty hallway until she was laughing along with him. The combined sound between them so exuberant and joyful, not a single care for the world outside of the two of them at that moment.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>He spun them until he was dizzy and even then he couldn\u2019t be bothered by the tilting sway of his world because he\u2019d set her down and she was blushing like mad and beaming up at him with those bright blue eyes that were always so familiar and-</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<span>Oh my god\u2026</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Trembling hands moved from her arms up to her face, cupping her cheeks gently; fingers brushing against the stud earrings she never took off. \u201cMy Lady?\u201d His tone was soft and questioning, and no one could possibly blame him for that because this was an absolute dream and he was terrified of waking up.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>She chuckled back at him, soft tender gaze looking absolutely radiant as she lifted a hand to brush away the remains of tear streaks from his cheek, \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter Chaton? Cat got your tongue?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Adrien\u2019s eyes widened once more because he will </span>\n<em>\n<span>never</span>\n</em>\n<span> not love hearing her call him that without a mask, but also she just punned and it\u2019s doing things for him.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>But none of that mattered. There was only one thing Adrien wanted to ask her at that moment.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cCan I kiss you?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>There\u2019s surprise in her expression but she doesn\u2019t look upset by the request. In fact, there is a playful gleam in her eye as she smiled at him now, \u201cI\u2019d be offended if you didn\u2019t.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Let no one ever say Adrien Agreste made it a habit of offending ladies.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<span>His Lady.</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<span>His partner.</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<span>His best friend.</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>All wrapped up in this one amazing girl, who tilted her head up, eyes fluttering shut so sweetly, cheeks tinted the most adorable shade of pink.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>God he almost forgot how to breathe again.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Which was absolutely fine. Because, as soon as he leaned in, lips pressing softly to hers, he realized with startling clarity that he would spend the rest of his life having his breath stolen away by this girl and he would revel in every moment of it.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAhem-\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The sound of someone clearing their throat brought the two of them out of their little bubble, making them part slightly, but Adrien refused to let her get very far out of his grasp, to look back to the classroom door.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Where half the class piled up nearly on top of one another to gawk at them.</span>\n</p>"
