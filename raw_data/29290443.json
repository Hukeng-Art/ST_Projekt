  "text": "<p>\u201cYou\u2019re using English again,\u201d Reki said. \u201cSo you\u2019re hiding something from me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Langa stopped playing at the wheels of his board to look up. The sun dwindled overhead, purples and blues splashing across the sky as night pressed its lips to the day. Faint rays caught on the metal of the skatepark\u2019s ramps and rails, blazing in Langa\u2019s eyes with a final glory. He squinted finding Reki\u2019s face pinched in a pout. Slowly, he blinked.</p>\n<p>The words slipped from his tongue when Reki claimed that it would be impossible for him to nail his latest trick by tomorrow. He didn\u2019t necessarily think that would be the case, muttering a <em> liar </em>under his breath. Yet, his mind didn\u2019t catch up with the words until Reki pointed them out, nor did he notice his growing habit.</p>\n<p>\u201cReally?\u201d Langa asked.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, all the time,\u201d Reki said. \u201cEarlier you said something about me having a <em> unique </em>face.\u201d</p>\n<p>Langa winced at the butchered word. It came out sounding more like uni \u2018q\u2019.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t do it all the time.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou definitely do. I can recall ten at the very least.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you even know what they mean?\u201d</p>\n<p>Reki stopped talking; instead, he started toying at the rainbow sticker on his board.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWell no.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThen don\u2019t worry about it,\u201d Langa said. \u201cIf it was important I\u2019d tell you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Reki\u2019s expression softened at that. His eyes melting into soft crescents with a shimmering smile collecting all the fading swaths of light. Langa averted his gaze before Reki could open his eyes. His body inched a millimeter closer.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAlright then! Let\u2019s head out, I\u2019m starving!\u201d Reki said pumping his hands in the air. Langa looked down at his board and the half pipe.</p>\n<p>\u201cI wanna do\u2013\u201c</p>\n<p>His stomach cut him off, giving a loud rumble. He stared down, mind warring with his body. When he looked up, he met Reki\u2019s eyes, and the sound of a chiming bell of laughter filled the air.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up with that? Come on lets go before your stomach gets any louder.\u201d</p>\n<p>Langa\u2019s lips pursued, but watching Reki\u2019s bemused smirk and bouncy stride, he softened down to his core.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Reki chose to eat at their typical spot. The italian restaurant kindly had a bike rack where they left their boards on Langa\u2019s motorcycle and entered as the sun gave rest to the stars.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Langa trailed behind Reki as he hollered to Joe about their arrival. At the usual call, Langa expected for Joe to poke his head out and yell at them to calm down and that he\u2019d be out in a minute. But he didn\u2019t hear that. In fact, he didn\u2019t hear anything.</p>\n<p>The nighttime rush Langa grew accustomed to disappeared, and in its place were empty booths and no waiters. Langa blinked and glanced over his shoulder at the sign. The typical hours were still posted, but the open sign faced towards him.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey Reki\u2013\u201c</p>\n<p>\u201cJoe, we\u2019re here!\u201d Reki said, blowing over Langa\u2019s statement to charge farther inside. \u201cWhere should we\u2013\u201c</p>\n<p>It\u2019s almost like a film how Reki stopped. His body halted, his face frozen. He gaped and blinked twice before twinges of red brushed his cheeks. Langa tightened his face and tilted his head forward. The pause button hit on him as well.</p>\n<p>Inside the booth were Joe and Cherry wrapped together, hands splayed on each other\u2019s waists and hair while their lips interlocked At least, for a small moment they were before their eyes flew open and they pulled apart quicker than a lightning strike.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Langa didn\u2019t mean to stare, but he did because something about it clicked in his chest. Maybe it was the way their lips fit together like puzzles pieces, or perhaps how their shape merged to one.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat the hell are you doing here?\u201d Joe asked, springing upright. \u201cDidn\u2019t you read the sign?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, but I thought it didn\u2019t apply to us,\u201d Reki said. \u201cI didn\u2019t think it was reserved for uh\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou better watch what you say next because if it\u2019s something unsavory, I\u2019ll make sure you don\u2019t skate another race.\u201d Cherry said.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Reki swallowed his tongue.</p>\n<p>Langa watched him for a moment, before turning back to Joe and Cherry.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell since you\u2019re here, I\u2019ll get something made up for you two,\u201d Joe said, pushing away from Cherry whose eyes continued to roam over him. \u201cBut I\u2019m charging extra. It\u2019s after hours anyway.\u201d</p>\n<p>Joe bustled off, and Langa couldn\u2019t help but notice the loosened state of his apron. He decided to keep his lips glued.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhile he\u2019s doing that, I suppose you two need some sort of explanation.\u201d Cherry said with a sigh.</p>\n<p>\u201cI mean yeah. Didn\u2019t know you two were\u2013\u201c</p>\n<p>\u201cWatch your tongue.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDating,\u201d Reki finished. \u201cI was going to say dating.\u201d</p>\n<p>Langa and Reki clambered into the booth while Cherry\u2019s tapping foot grew restless. There was a pink to his cheeks that reminded Langa of his hair. It was full of life and something akin to love.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo\u2026?\u201d Reki said.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo?\u201d Cherry said.</p>\n<p>\u201cHow long has this been a thing?\u201d</p>\n<p>Cherry glowered.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe dating, I mean.\u201d Reki said.</p>\n<p>Cherry sighed and relaxed into the chair. The padding squeaked underneath as he turned his head up as though the memory hung above his eyes.</p>\n<p>\u201cAbout three years,\u201d Cherry said. \u201cUnofficially.\u201d</p>\n<p>Reki\u2019s lips fell. Langa just stared.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIt was pretty on and off at the beginning but now\u2026\u201d Cherry looked back into the kitchen. \u201cIt\u2019s better. We\u2019ve made adjustments according to each other, so I think we\u2019re on a steady path.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAdjustments?\u201d Langa asked.</p>\n<p>The padding squeaked again as Cherry brought his head down.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cRelationships are complicated,\u201d he said. \u201cCommunication between each other can be quite difficult, but is simultaneously necessary for the relationship to work. We weren\u2019t on that page for a while. Now, I think we are.\u201d</p>\n<p>Langa blinked, staring down into his lap. He messed with the little seams running down his leg in matching strands.</p>\n<p>\u201cHow did you know you liked him?\u201d Reki asked. \u201cYou two kind of seemed like you hated each other.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Langa spared a glance upwards. Reki\u2019s face glowed with curiosity. It took a second for Langa to look back towards Cherry.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat was the side effect of our emotions. We didn\u2019t know how to handle what we felt,\u201d Cherry said. \u201cSee, there was a pull of sorts. In a room, only he mattered. I wanted to spend all my time with him. I wanted to be with him. Even when we bickered back then, I enjoyed his attention. Over time, it all piled on me, and, after much denial, I realized that he was different.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd here we are.\u201d</p>\n<p>A key clicked into place in Langa\u2019s heart. It shuddered within him, waking hidden information from a slumber so deep it could\u2019ve been eternal. As blood pumped through him, Langa pulled his arm closer. His skin brushed Reki\u2019s jacket and blazed with a fire.</p>\n<p>He blinked once, twice, and a third time.</p>\n<p>\u201cWow you\u2019ve really got it bad.\u201d Reki said. His laugh drifted into Langa\u2019s gut where it burned.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd these are the reasons we didn\u2019t want to inform you,\u201d Cherry said. \u201cEspecially you. So listen here, if you mutter a word of this to anyone not present here, I will personally ensure that your board is drowning in the ocean. Do you hear me?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes sir!\u201d Reki said.</p>\n<p>Langa\u2019s eyes turned back to Reki, taking in the small details of his face. The more he looked, the more detailed it became, drawing in every piece of Langa\u2019s attention.</p>\n<p>Oh.</p>\n<p>Oh was this\u2013</p>\n<p>\u201cFood\u2019s ready!\u201d Joe said, slapping down three pizzas. Langa lurched at the sudden movement, jolting from his head space.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He didn\u2019t eat much, or at least what he was used to. His stomach was all fluttery after Cherry\u2019s speech. His mind churned over and over with new information. It was though there was a fence he stood upon, and on the other side, light began breaking through the mist.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Did he like Reki?\u00a0</p>\n<p>A cough came from beside him as Reki choked on his pizza. He gagged, Joe laughing across the table and telling him to slow down. Langa\u2019s eyes narrowed, and he slapped at Reki\u2019s back until his fit passed.</p>\n<p>Once calmed down, Langa handed Reki his glass. Their fingers brushed at that moment and again that rush found him.</p>\n<p>\u201cThanks, you\u2019re a lifesaver!\u201d Reki said, downing the glass in one gulp. \u201cUnlike some people who\u2019d rather watch me suffer.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re the one who barged in here!\u201d Joe said.</p>\n<p>Langa took another glance at Reki, before he looked down at his plate. His reflection greeted him in the grease, and his mind continued to churn past it.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Langa concluded he did in fact like Reki when, instead of spending his birthday with only his mom, he goes to Reki\u2019s house instead. He stared at the invitation on his phone, and he <em> knew. </em>Because there was no one else he\u2019d rather be with. There was no one else who mattered quite the same.</p>\n<p>So Langa packed his bag for the night, headed out after celebrating with his mom, and rode under the starlight to Reki\u2019s house. All the while his heart pounded with the knowledge rushing past his ears.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He arrived early, ten minutes in fact, and parked his motorcycle at Reki\u2019s gate. He grabbed his bag and board, walking in moments later.</p>\n<p>\u201cHappy birthday!\u201d Reki greeted him at the door, throwing his arms over him in his typical enthusiasm. But this time Langa froze. It was only for a moment, but his muscles tensed as though electricity hit him. And it did, sparking through his toes to his head.</p>\n<p>\u201cEverything alright?\u2019 Reki asked after he.failed to respond. \u201cAnyone home in there?\u201d</p>\n<p>Langa pouted to reanimate himself. \u201cYeah I\u2019m here. Thank you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t be thanking me just yet; there\u2019s still a lot more coming for you tonight.\u201d</p>\n<p>And there was.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Reki presented his homemade poutine dish for him, that tasted odd, but the thought alone had Langa staring in amazement. Reki\u2019s sisters had baked him cupcakes, and his mother a cake which they downed after singing.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Afterward their dinner, Reki handed Langa a gift wrapped in purple wrapping paper. Langa stared at it with uncertainty. He shook it once.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey don\u2019t be doing that!\u201d Reki said, hands reaching out as if to stop him.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo it's something delicate?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI mean <em> it </em>could be. If you want to take that chance then you totally can.\u201d</p>\n<p>Langa smiled as Reki pouted, arms crossing over each other. There was a flicker of eagerness along Reki\u2019s face that pushed him to swipe open his gift.</p>\n<p>It was a wooden box, but upon opening it there were many items inside. It was like a little treasure chest.</p>\n<p>There were all sorts of skateboarding accessories from small bearings, to bandages, to a little blue wrench with the Canadian flag and some stickers, one of which said over the rainbow on it. Then in the corner, Langa spotted red.</p>\n<p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t sure what you needed for your board so I kind of bought everything,\u201d Reki said, scratching at his face. \u201cThere\u2019s even stickers since I don\u2019t think you\u2019ve put any on yet.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d Langa asked, picking up the headband in the corner.</p>\n<p>Reki froze, and the faintest snow of red covered his cheeks. His head dipped down and eyes looked away. Langa\u2019s chest swirled with blue.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, I noticed that your bangs sometimes get in your face when you\u2019re skating. I thought maybe that might help. You totally don\u2019t have to use it or anything.\u201d</p>\n<p>Langa looked between it and Reki, noticing how they were matching. He smiled.</p>\n<p>\u201cLove it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Reki blinked a few times.</p>\n<p>\u201cHuh?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI like it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh\u2026 oh yeah! That\u2019s awesome! Need any help putting it on?\u201d</p>\n<p>Langa examined the band, about to dismiss it even as his heart ached at the thought of Reki being close, but he realized he didn\u2019t know how to put it on.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah sure.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGreat!\u201d</p>\n<p>Reki bounded over, hands wrapping around the band. He positioned himself behind Langa, pressing his body close with his hands pulling at the strap. Langa tensed, heat searing across his back in waves. His body unconsciously moved back, getting closer and attempting to fit into the space Reki allowed.</p>\n<p>The band twisted across his face, brushing back his clumps of hair and moving them out of his eyes. Reki\u2019s hands were warm near his face. Langa wondered if they were soft.</p>\n<p>\u201cTurn around I wanna see it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Langa complied, facing Reki. He noticed then their distance, or lack thereof. Their breaths mixed as Reki stared. His eyes were wide and shining like rubies.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt looks awesome!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell yeah. You look good in almost anything!\u201d</p>\n<p>Silence descended between them as Langa kept his eyes on Reki. A pull sounded in his gut; a need to be closer. His breath hitched and the impulsive part of his mind pushed forwards\u2013</p>\n<p>But his body didn\u2019t. Because this was Reki. This was the person he wanted to be with. But what if they weren\u2019t on the same page? What if their adjustments weren\u2019t in place? Would he be back to spending his birthdays alone?</p>\n<p>And even if that wasn\u2019t the case, how could <em> he </em>say it correctly? What did he know about communication?</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, thanks,\u201d Langa said, pulling away. \u201cI\u2019m keeping it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAwesome!\u201d Reki grinned. \u201cNow let's go put some of those stickers on your board. It could use a little spicing up.\u201d</p>\n<p>Langa watched as his Reki gathered up the box and sprang away. Langa wondered if he could hear the pounding of his heart. Maybe then he\u2019d understand how he felt without saying those terrifying words.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It was two in the morning, and Reki passed out next to Langa. His faint snores carried through the room, light but still drawing Langa\u2019s full attention.</p>\n<p>In his hands, Langa played at his headband, stretching it and releasing it. He stared at the small dinosaur looking shape and sighed.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He shouldn\u2019t be upset. It was a fun birthday. He spent it with Reki and had his favorite dish and ate cake and talked skateboarding. But he still didn\u2019t say what he wanted.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He still kept those thoughts and desires locked up inside of him. And they didn\u2019t want to stay there. They wanted to be spoken into existence; no, at this point it was a need. The words didn\u2019t belong in his head, even if they were to change everything. But if he said them, he could never take them back. So as his heart screamed to let them out, his brain, for once, locked onto them holding them so he kept them back.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Yet maybe\u2026 he could. Maybe Reki didn\u2019t need to understand. Langa\u2019s chest burst to say it, and he could in his own special way.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cReki?\u201d Langa said. He heard no reply, except for the buzzing in his heart so he sucked in a breath. \u201cReki <em> I want to be with you.\u201d </em></p>\n<p>And as if a dam broke, the ringing in Langa\u2019s chest rushed out before calming into a tranquil stream. He stared at Rek with that pull driving his thoughts and body. And he smiled because the words were there. They were in the air. He could say what he wanted to say, albeit in his own secret language. And maybe\u2026 someday\u2026 he could say it between them.</p>\n<p>\n<span>Two books sat on Reki\u2019s table, the one he was supposed to read, and one he actually read. Murmurs of the teacher filled overhead; a drone he paid no mind to. Those words were measly and weak, ones that passed through his head everyday. On his page, however, these meant something more.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>He messed with his pencil as he moved through the book, leafing through unfamiliar grounds and letter combinations that only lit up a small part of his brain. Their definitions were lost in translation, but he was determined to discover the meaning.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Above the page flipping and the long tone of his teacher, a voice kept playing in Reki\u2019s head. Days passed, but it remained a constant force. It demanded all his attention, with a soft tone so open and honest it begged to be heard.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Reki\u2019s eyes strayed to his right. Similar to himself, Langa had an open but neglected book. Instead, a phone sucked in Langa\u2019s attention. His face scrunched in concentration, small stream like crevices pulling his face together. Under the table, his feet tapped and rose in motion with the video as though he were dancing in his own freestyle. Reki stared, his surroundings falling to watch as Langa mimed a trick.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>It took Reki a moment to notice his distraction before he turned back to the paper of unfamiliar terms. His face pinched, and he struggled to hold in the groan wanting to escape.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Days passed and still those words were stuck in his brain. They were spoken to him in the middle of the night; in fact, sometimes he doubted he heard them. But Langa said them, and whenever he spoke, his language had purpose. Besides, how could Reki dream up an English saying?</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<span>I want to be with you.\u00a0</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>From the softness and honesty of Langa\u2019s tone, Reki knew the phrase meant something powerful, but what he couldn\u2019t say,\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>He knew the ending and beginning, </span>\n<em>\n<span>I </span>\n</em>\n<span>and </span>\n<em>\n<span>you. </span>\n</em>\n<span>Various songs on the radio played those words in lyrics like </span>\n<em>\n<span>I love you.\u00a0</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>But what did Langa want to share between himself and Reki? What was so important that he had to hide it away and only share in the most vulnerable of times?</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Sadly, Reki\u2019s English dictionary did not have the answer. He scrolled through the </span>\n<em>\n<span>WA </span>\n</em>\n<span>section but struggled to figure out exactly what word Langa used.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The bell rang, calling students to their dismissal. Reki\u2019s focus remained on the paper, trying to see if could possibly be </span>\n<em>\n<span>WAND. </span>\n</em>\n<span>The word didn\u2019t seem to fit. Why would Langa talk about some magical stick? It didn\u2019t pertain to either of them or their situation.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cReki,\u201d Langa said, starling him from his musings. \u201cThe bell rang. We should head out.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOh yeah! Just a minute.\u201d Reki said.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>He went to take one final check of words but as he did so his protective covering came down. Langa\u2019s face hovered inches from his own, replacing his torn down school book. Reki jumped back; his chest tumbled at the sudden closeness.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Langa leaned closer, eyes locked on Reki\u2019s for a pause before they flitted downwards. Instead of turning back up as Reki wanted, they stayed on the table.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d Langa asked, picking up the book. \u201cYou never study.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHey don\u2019t\u2013\u201c</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cEnglish dictionary?\u201d Langa read from the cover. His body tightened for a second, his arms scrunching in as his face blanched. \u201cWhat are you doing with this?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI wanted to learn some English phrases since you use them so often,\u201d Reki said. \u201cWouldn\u2019t it be cool to have our own secret language?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Langa\u2019s gaze turned cold blowing an icy wind down Reki\u2019s back. Instead of handing the book back to Reki, Langa placed it in his backpack.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI told you before,\u201d Langa said, \u201cIf there\u2019s something I need to say, I\u2019ll tell it to you. Now let\u2019s get going.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Reki nodded, but he sulked down for a second, looking to the place his stolen book used to rest. His gaze shifted to Langa where he stood by the doorway, looking off into the distant with a blank gaze. Yet, underneath it a chill stirred, pulling his body tight.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Reki pulled his attention back to the present, concluding that Langa\u2019s words indeed meant something he wasn\u2019t yet willing to say.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI don\u2019t get it!\u201d Reki groaned, bumping his head against the table. The thump echoed through the restaurant, but to his luck it was after closing and no heads turned. Instead, he moped with only his lukewarm food as company.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhy can\u2019t he at least let me keep the dictionary?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Langa and Reki skated after school at their usual park, going over tricks and what not. It was fun and free as always, but when Langa went in for a kickflip, Reki noticed how his weight wasn\u2019t distributed properly. His muscles were too tense, and he didn\u2019t land it like Reki predicted.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>That was the first sign that something was off. The next was that he told Reki he couldn\u2019t get dinner after. He said he was eating with his mom, but Reki couldn\u2019t remember if he ever skipped their after skating meals.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>And the most unnerving of all was that he wouldn\u2019t let Reki have the dictionary back. Even when Reki asked as they left he said that Reki didn\u2019t need it.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou\u2019re just going to look up dirty words,\u201d Langa said. \u201cAnd no, for the last time I\u2019m not teaching you them.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>But even as he joked, his body curled in; his appearance made small. He clutched at the straps at his backpack where his book resided as though it was a lifeline.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>And the cold in his eyes still chilled Reki even as he sat in the heated restaurant. Reki wasn\u2019t sure if he was more chilled by that or his lack of company.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI know that its after hours, but I still don\u2019t want you shouting in here,\u201d Joe said, sticking his head in the booth in front of Reki. \u201cRuins the mood you know?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The wail of an Italian opera singer rang overhead.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cSorry.\u201d Reki said, burying his face into the arms of his hoodie. He tried to gather his thoughts together and freeze the rushing heat through his veins, but the curled image of Langa intruded once more. He kept asking himself what made Langa so afraid? It was only a book.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The groan of cushions pulled Reki\u2019s attention up to where Joe spread himself across the booth. His arms rested against the mahogany as he considered Reki with a half raised brow.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cLooks like someone\u2019s a little upset.\u201d Joe said\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIt\u2019s nothing.\u201d Reki said into his arms. \u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou can\u2019t fool me kid,\u201d Joe said. \u201cYou don\u2019t mope that often, but it\u2019s pretty a virus when you do. Plus, Langa isn\u2019t with you so something must be up.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Reki sighed, staring down at his jacket the the threads on it. One line of stitching was frayed.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cDo you ever try to understand something, but it seems like whenever you try, it doesn\u2019t go right?\u201d Reki asked.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhat\u2019s this about?\u201d Joe asked.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The torn stitch grew larger.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cLanga said something to me the other night in English, so I don\u2019t understand it. I tried to figure it out on my own, but Langa keeps stopping me even though he said he\u2019d tell me if something was important. And this feels important. It\u2019s almost like he\u2019s hiding something.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI don\u2019t know, maybe I\u2019m just overreacting.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Reki groaned and smashed his face into the wood, arms covering his head. A whistle rang overhead.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThe two of you really got it bad.\u201d Joe said.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhat\u2019s that supposed to mean?\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Joe laughed and flicked his hand in the air as though to dispell an unwanted scent.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOh nothing,\u201d he said. \u201cSo Langa\u2019s hiding something, huh? I didn\u2019t take him much as the mysterious type.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI didn\u2019t either,\u201d Reki said. \u201cHe usually says his mind, you know? Anything that\u2019s important to him he shares, so I don\u2019t get why he would hide something. He never does that to me.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Joe\u2019s smile softened like petals in the breeze.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhat?\u201d Reki asked.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNothing,\u201d Joe said. \u201cJust getting reminded of something, that\u2019s all.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Before Reki could ask, Joe moved to his next point.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cSo he said something in English that you want to know the meaning of? Well I got someone who can help with that. You know what he said right?\u201d Joe said.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYeah, I do,\u201d Reki said. \u201cWait, who do you know?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Joe twisted around, hand going to grab his phone from his pant pocket. He pulled it out and with quick hands dialed a number seemingly by heart. Reki never saw fingers move so quickly.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHello?\u2019 A voice came from the other side.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHey, Kaoru I need your help.\u201d Joe said.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cDidn\u2019t I tell you to call only in the case of emergencies?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThis </span>\n<em>\n<span>is </span>\n</em>\n<span>an emergency. Poor Reki\u2019s going to have his heart broken if you don\u2019t help.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIt isn\u2019t </span>\n<em>\n<span>that </span>\n</em>\n<span>serious.\u201d Reki said. But Langa\u2019s avoidance and fear burned Reki\u2019s chest in scorching waves. He didn\u2019t know if he would be able to withstand the heat for that long. The empty space beside him was an abyss.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhat seems to be the issue?\u201d Cherry asked.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cReki here is having some communication issues with Langa.\u201d Joe said.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cReally?\u201d Cherry asked.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIt\u2019s not like that,\u201d Reki said. \u201cLanga just told me something in English, and I\u2019m trying to figure it out.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhy do you need my help? Can\u2019t you do that on your own?\u201d Cherry asked.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHe took my English dictionary.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The phone\u2019s feedback cut. Reki wondered if the line went dead.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAlright,\u201d Cherry said. \u201cCarla can help translate. What is the phrase he said?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Reki toyed at the edges of his sweater before sucking in a breath and stopping.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201c</span>\n<em>\n<span>I want to be with you.</span>\n</em>\n<span>\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Joe froze next to him while\u00a0 Cherry repeated the phrase through the phone. After a bit of rustling, Carla\u2019s voice came through the intercom.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201c</span>\n<em>\n<span>I want to be with you </span>\n</em>\n<span>translates to I want to be with you. In English, this could mean the desire to keep another\u2019s company or the desire to be in a relationship with another person.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Reki\u2019s breath caught in his throat. He feared his breathing stopped. Yet, his brain moved quicker than his lungs, processing the information and spinning it into long quilts. The blankets of thoughts were heavy, trapping Reki inside them.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>So did this mean\u2026 Langa liked him?</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>He choked out a breath and a breezy laugh.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Of course, this was Langa. Something like this was big and new and unpredictable. It was like riding a skateboard for the first time with his weight distributed in such an unfamiliar position. It was terrifying.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The call to check if Reki was awake, the two in the morning time stamp, the English itself. All of them cushions to ease his fall.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHey kid, you alright?\u201d Joe asked. His voice became an anchor that some part of Reki could hold onto to at least remind himself this was real.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cLanga only talks in English when he wants to hide something,\u201d Reki said dazed. \u201cHe wouldn\u2019t just say something I already know. This has to be\u2026\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<span>A confession.\u00a0</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The restaurant grew hot as though all the ovens were turned on. Reki\u2019s blood boiled, his hand coming to cover his mouth. He pinched it, confirming this was no dream. His heart rate spiked at that, and a wild grin tore across his face.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cReki you\u2013\u201c</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHe likes me, right?\u201d Reki asked, turning to Joe with a face glowing like a firefly. \u201cHe has to. He said it in English. He does. I didn\u2019t think he, or anyone for that matter. I gotta\u2013\u201c</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>A firm hand grasped Reki\u2019s shoulder, grounding his brain that began spiraling into oblivion.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOkay, okay calm down,\u201d Joe said. \u201cYou\u2019re getting a little hot there. Take a sip of water before we dive into this.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Reki glanced at the glass. He swore Langa was in the ripples.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cBut Joe\u2013\u201c</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI said drink your water and cool down. If you keep this up you\u2019re going to run off and embarrass yourself by confessing in the worst way possible.\u201d Joe said.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cListen to him, I would know.\u201d Cherry\u2019s voice carried through the room.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cShut up,\u201d Joe said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t that bad..\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>As Joe and Cherry squabbled in the background, Reki tried to cool his head. The water did nothing except speed up his thought process. It couldn\u2019t quench the shake of his hands nor tapping of his foot.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Langa liked him.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>And he well\u2026</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>He knew he had to do something about this.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI gotta go talk to him,\u201d Reki said. \u201cThis is too big to ignore.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHold on,\u201d Joe said, grabbing his arm as he threatened to get up. \u201cSit down a minute and just process it okay? \u2018Cause first of all how do you feel about him?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Reki stopped. He sat down and blinked twice, staring at the grooves of his hands.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>How did he feel?</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI,\u201d Reki started. \u201cI think he\u2019s amazing. He\u2019s really talented and actually shares my interests, you know?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Joe leaned back, arms crossing over each other. Reki shook his head.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cBut it goes beyond that, I guess. I mean, he\u2019s there for me. He\u2019s different. I don\u2019t how to explain it but whenever I\u2019m with him everything feels alright. I don\u2019t want to see him on edge cause it hurts me too. Like we\u2019re one somehow. I don\u2019t know.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI just really want to be with him.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Reki buried his head into his hoodie, his cheeks burning violently. In the dark edges of his visions, blue eyes and light smiles arose to paint the sky.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>A laugh sounded overhead, and Reki peered up to see Joe laughing. He grinned with knowledge seeping into the corners.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAlright then, I guess you two are on the same page huh?\u201d Joe said. \u201cWell then let\u2019s figure how he\u2019s going to get the relationship he wants.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Reki watched across the skatepark as Langa tore through the half pipe. He grabbed his board, flipping it over in some fancy fashion. But Reki didn\u2019t see that. Instead, his gaze focused on the red headband wrapped around Langa\u2019s head and how it pushed his hair out of his eyes.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The red matched the flush of Langa\u2019s cheeks from his hours of skating. It parted his hair and kept his sapphire eyes free to scan the terrain ahead of him. It was beautiful. He was beautiful.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Reki let out a groan and dropped his head into his lap. His heart raced, but his foot tapped faster. He licked his lips and repeated the words again in his head. He could do this.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The crack of the board pulled his attention upwards. Langa grinned as his board rolled forwards before he dismounted in front of Reki.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Reki stared at him. His hair blew in the breeze like flowers. Langa brushed a hand through his hair and pushed back the headband for good measure. Reki liked how it matched his. It was as though they shared something personal.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cReki!\u201d Langa said. \u201cDid you see that?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cSee what?\u201d Reki asked, blinking to get his mind in gear.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Langa frowned. \u201cMy Rock n\u2019 roll.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOh yeah! It was awesome.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201c</span>\n<em>\n<span>Liar.</span>\n</em>\n<span>\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Reki bristled at the tone. His foot began to tap again, this time at a much quicker pace.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cSorry, I was uh\u2026 thinking.\u201d Reki said. \u201cKinda got a little spaced out.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Langa blinked. \u201cEverything alright?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYeah, yeah. It\u2019s fine. It\u2019s just, uh, getting late. We should head out.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Langa blinked again. Reki hoped he couldn\u2019t hear the wild beat of his heart. He stood to at least calm the tap of his foot.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAlright,\u201d Langa said. \u201cLet\u2019s get going then.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Reki fell behind Langa as they made their way to his motorcycle. Overhead, the sky was splashed with purples fading into reds and blues. The sun started to take its rest, leaving a bit of light to catch on Reki\u2019s heated face. He gulped and licked his lips. Taking a step forward, he grabbed onto Langa's hand.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The two stopped. Langa turned as Reki kept his head down and tried controlling his breathing. He could do this. He </span>\n<em>\n<span>had </span>\n</em>\n<span>to do this. Because these words deserved a meaning.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Langa asked, facing him. His body inched close, his turn slow and unsure.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Reki kept his focus on the ground a millisecond more, conjuring up his courage, before turning his head to meet Langa\u2019s eyes.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201c</span>\n<em>\n<span>I want to be with you.</span>\n</em>\n<span>\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Reki\u2019s chest buzzed with the words in the air. His brain became dazed, the sun blurring Langa\u2019s features. But slowly, his widened face came into view. Langa\u2019s lips fell open and quivered as though his words caught in his throat.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cReki\u2013\u201c</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201c</span>\n<em>\n<span>Romantically,</span>\n</em>\n<span>\u201d Reki said. \u201c</span>\n<em>\n<span>I want to be with you romantically. I want\u2026. I want a relationship with you.</span>\n</em>\n<span>\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The words were awkward in his mouth. They came out in weird shapes, vowels scraping against the sides of his tongue. But they were free. And that feeling burning inside him escapes alongside it. The rush, the burning, the pull, all of it hung in the air.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Langa stared, his lips continuing to quiver. His face kept shifting. Something passed over his features. What it was Reki couldn\u2019t say.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>His hand fell from Reki\u2019s wrist and pulled into his body. He looked down. Reki\u2019s gut flared. Was this a mistake?</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI\u2019m\u2013\u201c</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cDid you hear me?\u201d Langa asked. \u201cWhat I said that night?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Reki blinked. \u201cOh, um yeah.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThat\u2019s why you had the dictionary?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYeah, it was. Sorry, I didn\u2019t want to alarm you. It just sounded\u2026 really important. And you usually tell me that stuff.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cSorry,\u201d Langa said. \u201cI was scared, but I wanted to say it.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cDon\u2019t apologize,\u201d Reki said. \u201cI\u2019m glad\u2026 I\u2019m glad you did.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Langa smiled. It was soft, barely pressed against his cheeks. A small fragile thing that Reki loved with every inch of himself.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cMe too because now I can say it for real,\u201d Langa murmured. \u201c</span>\n<em>\n<span>I want to be with you too </span>\n</em>\n<span>Reki.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>It was closing hours at Joe\u2019s restaurant again, but this time Reki knocked before walking in on something unsavory. After checking that the coast was clear, he pulled Langa into the booth where they waited for Joe to take their orders.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The two sat squished against one another, their shoulders touching and hands entwined beneath the table. Langa wore his headband which Reki played at, complimenting again how good it looked on him.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Reki\u2019s stomach fluttered as a small laugh twinkled from Langa\u2019s throat. He still couldn't get used to the sound nor having it so close. One of the many great things to come out of their new development.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou two get mad at us for kissing after hours, but you guys are just as bad,\u201d Joe said, placing down their trays. \u201cI\u2019m terrified what would happen if I let you unsupervised.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNothing like that would happen!\u201d Reki said, his face blazing. \u201cOnly you two do stuff like that.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhat sort of things are you implying?\u201d Cherry asked, appearing behind Joe.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Reki startled, letting out a slight scream.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cJust handholding.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIt better be limited to that.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Reki rolled his eyes, and turned back to the food. He began to eat as Cherry and Joe eyed over them. Langa ate next to him, getting a small bit of red sauce on his chin. Reki laughed at that.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhat\u2019s up with that? Here let me get it,\u201d Reki said, grabbing for his napkin and dabbing at Langa\u2019s chin.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>His eyes lingered far longer than they should\u2019ve, gaze locked onto Langa\u2019s.
