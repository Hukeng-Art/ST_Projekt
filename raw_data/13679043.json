  "text": "<p>\n<span>It\u2019s supposed to be long flight. It\u2019s supposed to be a nice long </span>\n<em>\n<span>cruising</span>\n</em>\n<span> flight with an expensive pair of headphones, Hoseok\u2019s latest short story downloaded to his phone, and minimal interaction. Considering the conference Yoongi\u2019s about to have to sit through, this flight either sounds like the calm before the boring storm or the long walk to the guillotine. He\u2019s already entirely comfortable in his aisle seat, just minutes before take-off, when a pair of legs - tall, stupid long legs - stops immediately next to him. He follows them until they meet a torso then a chest then further still to a nervous but expectant face. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>He\u2019s talking, and Yoongi pulls one headphone out. \u201cWhat?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry, I\u2019m - I actually - the inside seat, that\u2019s my seat.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Yoongi sighs, shifting his legs to the side and letting the tall dude struggle past him. It\u2019s a mistake. His lazy ass should\u2019ve just stood up and moved because the moment this guy struggles past him, dick first - as if that would somehow be more comfortable than shimmying his ass inches past Yoongi\u2019s face instead - Yoongi can feel the hair raise up on the back of his neck. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>The other guy freezes too, his face as much in the </span>\n<em>\n<span>oh shit</span>\n</em>\n<span> range as Yoongi\u2019s. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Usually, Yoongi\u2019s fine. Usually, he picks up on soft scents here and there, subtle alpha pheromones that he easily ignores, like strong cologne in an open space, he\u2019s </span>\n<em>\n<span>usually</span>\n</em>\n<span> very good at pretending to not be affected. Unfortunately, he\u2019s sitting eye-to-dick level with the best smelling man he\u2019s ever even crossed paths with, and now he\u2019s stuck next to him for the duration of this flight. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>The guy blushes slightly - </span>\n<em>\n<span>cute</span>\n</em>\n<span>, Yoongi thinks, annoyed by the concept of it - and tries to continue on but gets jerked back when his laptop bag gets stuck on the outside arm. Yoongi\u2019s hands shoot up to help him, unfortunately landing on his chest to help him stand upright which is\u2026 surprisingly a lot firmer than Yoongi would\u2019ve guessed. He pulls back quickly, deciding uncatching the bag is a two-hand job.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Yoongi wonders for a moment what else might be a</span>\n<em>\n<span> two-hand job</span>\n</em>\n<span>, and he makes a mental note to deck Taehyung right in the mouth for giving him the ability to construct that thought. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThank you\u2026\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYeah,\u201d comes Yoongi\u2019s eloquent response as the guy manages to spin and fall into his seat. Poor guy is 75% leg and having trouble getting them to fit comfortably under the seat in front of him. </span>\n<em>\n<span>Daddy long legs.</span>\n</em>\n<span> Yoongi glares at the screen of his phone and frowns, opening his groupchat with his officemates. </span>\n<em>\n<span>You\u2019re all fired when I get back</span>\n</em>\n<span>. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Taehyung is of course the first to respond, with a concerned </span>\n<em>\n<span>:0</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Jin soon follows, </span>\n<em>\n<span>Jimin says that\u2019s fine, thanks for nothing you old sack of shit</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<span>I DID NOT SAY THAT,</span>\n</em>\n<span> Jimin defends with more than enough angry and crying emojis that Yoongi\u2019s inclined to believe him. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<span>ok I\u2019m heading into the sky to never come back, pls don\u2019t burn the office down. </span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Taehyung responds with several kissy emojis, and they all wish him luck before he turns on airplane mode and nestles into the fabric of his hoodie, earbuds in and story up on his screen. He hates how impossible it already is to focus with the smell of his seat neighbor. He brings the fabric of his hood up and scrunches himself down impossibly small. The plane begins taxiing the runway and his shoulders tense a little because for the next nine hours, that prickling sense on the back of his neck and the knots in his stomach are his reality. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>It starts\u2026 fine. The flight is fine. Shaky at the start, Yoongi found unfortunate comfort in the scent his seatmate put out and eventually uncurled the fist he\u2019d made out of nerves. He turns to glare at the guy all the same because the only reason the scent is remotely comforting is because Yoongi wants to stick his whole dick in it, drink it, drown it it. He can\u2019t even put his finger on it, like\u2026 warm. And dirty. Like Yoongi\u2019s got a mouth full of - </span>\n<em>\n<span>oh</span>\n</em>\n<span>. Coffee beans. The real shit, the kind you get real dark and ground in a press, strong and potent and natural, and tasty even if it is bitter. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Yoongi likes bitter. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>He risks a glance over and the guy is reading a book, a real book, in his hands, and he\u2019s turning the pages with the dumbest long fingers Yoongi\u2019s ever seen. They\u2019re like art, perfectly manicured nails, no callouses to be seen, thin silver bracelet hanging delicately off his wrist. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>He wants those things three deep inside him. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>His eyes get wide and he faces forward immediately as he feels himself leak a little. He ignores the way the guy next to him looks over in a mild panic himself. Yoongi tries to unbuckle his seatbelt and stand, but the flight attendant descends on him in the blink of an eye because the remain seated sign is still lit.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNo you don\u2019t understand, is there anywhere I can be moved? Any open seat anywhere?\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, sir, our flight today is full.\u201d Her eyes flicker to the other man then back to Yoongi. \u201cIs there something you\u2019d like to speak to me about privately?\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Yoongi can tell from the hints of her smell that she\u2019s an omega as well, and he instantly feels bad that he\u2019s caused her to worry for him. \u201cNo, no. Just having a mild\u2026 thing. Panic. Flying, y\u2019know?\u201d He lets himself be talked back into sitting in the small moist patch inside his underwear where his slick has managed to pool. He turns to the guy, more than a little pissed. \u201cThis is </span>\n<em>\n<span>your</span>\n</em>\n<span> fault.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201c</span>\n<em>\n<span>Me</span>\n</em>\n<span>? What did I do?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIf you weren\u2019t pumping out pheromones like a frat boy on sorority row, this wouldn\u2019t be a problem.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhat\u2019s the - what\u2019s the problem exactly?\u201d He looks like a deer in headlights, but Yoongi refuses to be swayed. \u201cI just thought you smelled - uh, you smell like, good? It\u2019s a little stronger than usual for me, but - I didn\u2019t think that was my fault.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhatever, just\u2026 I smell you. We get it. You\u2019re a big, bad alpha and I\u2019m a sweet, uwu omega. Just\u2026 keep your smell on that side of the armrest.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAt no point since I sat down have I thought you were a sweet uwu anything, so let\u2019s get that straight.\u201d He grumbles before grabbing his book off his lap and turning toward the window. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Yoongi frowns, refusing to let himself feel bad about making this stranger upset considering he\u2019s essentially fucking wet himself just in his presence. Fucking biological imperative bullshit. Sighing, Yoongi adjusts the front of his jeans to alleviate the tightness of his cock slightly plumping up as he frowns deeper. He tries real hard to ignore the way he catches the other guy lay his book down gently facedown in his lap. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Don\u2019t, he implores his mind. Please don\u2019t follow the train of thought that involves wondering how thick his cock probably is. Although, he\u2019s built like a stringbean, he\u2019s probably long\u2026 could probably get real deep... Yoongi shudders as another wave of slick trickles out of him and the guy next to him chokes a little. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWill you quit? I didn\u2019t even do anything this time,\u201d the guy whispers, begging him, clutching the book in desperation. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhy the fuck do you smell like dirt?\u201d It comes out a little less angry than Yoongi was hoping.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI don\u2019t know, why do </span>\n<em>\n<span>you</span>\n</em>\n<span>?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhat the fuck are you talking about? I do not.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>And then guy does the worst possible thing he could do, pivoting toward Yoongi quickly and leaning in so close Yoongi can feel his breath against his neck as he inhales. He stays there a beat too long, taking another breath, and Yoongi is slipping. \u201cNo, I definitely smell dirt. Like that really bitter and heavy dark chocolate that\u2019s more bean than sugar.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou\u2019re one to talk,\u201d Yoongi struggles to say even as the guy leans back into his seat. \u201cI feel like I just ate a handful of coffee beans off the ground sitting next to you. It\u2019s pretentious.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>The guy huffs. \u201cMost people call it homey and comforting.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cMost people must be actively trying to fuck you.\u201d Oh. He didn\u2019t mean to say that. If he was trying not to think about actively riding this dude\u2019s dick before, it\u2019s an impossibility now that he\u2019s vocalized it. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cBut you\u2019re not most people, right?\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Why is he smiling? Yoongi hates it. He finally really truly looks at him, immediately regretting it. He\u2019s got a button nose, thick lips, and a deep pair of dimples. He looks smug and shy at the same time, and Yoongi begs every god he can think of in his current state to either crash the plane or let him out of this seat because his underwear might be ruined but he can at least hope to save his jeans by this point. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>The overhead console dings, and the light goes off, signifying that Yoongi can now move freely about the cabin. And move he does, unclicking his seatbelt so fast he accidentally knocks his own knuckles on the metal of the buckle, and he grimaces twice over as he nearly trips on his way to the bathroom. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>It\u2019s a relief to be able to breathe away from that scent, and he can feel himself start to calm a little, edging away from arousal and annoyance and instead plummeting into full-scale embarrassment. That guy knew he was wet. How fucking </span>\n<em>\n<span>embarrassing</span>\n</em>\n<span>, he puts his head in his hands. He\u2019s supposed to sit next to this guy for how long again? He\u2019s not entirely sure what to do other than live in the bathroom for the next nine hours unless he plans on changing clothes a few more times. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>He rests his forehead against the mirror and grips the small sink for some sort of anchor, wracking his brain for a solution. It comes in the form of a quiet knock, and Yoongi knows. He whispers a ragged </span>\n<em>\n<span>fuck</span>\n</em>\n<span>, not even pretending to be bothered by the slick that finally does him in, guaranteed soaking his underwear. If anything, when he opens the door, he considers it self-preservation for his jeans. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>The guy, as Yoongi so affectionately calls him in his mind, stands there in his full glory, smelling like dark roast coffee beans and looking like a model in his black-on-grey turtleneck and slacks, with an obvious erection as he clutches his hands nervously. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Yoongi sighs. He\u2019s never met quite as shy an alpha as this dude, but Yoongi finds he likes it. He likes it a lot. He shudders as the door closes them both in, and there\u2019s a small moment where they just sort of exist in too close a proximity, chests heaving despite their efforts to restrain themselves, and they\u2019re doing pretty well until Yoongi\u2019s watching his tongue wet his stupid fat bottom lip and dart back inside, making Yoongi\u2019s stomach clench and threatening to ruin his jeans too. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>The guy is on him in a second, and god, he\u2019s tall, Yoongi thinks as he has to tilt up so far to let him kiss him. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOh, </span>\n<em>\n<span>god</span>\n</em>\n<span>,\u201d he moans when there\u2019s a pair of hands on his ass, gripping hard and pulling him forward to grind their cocks together. \u201cAre you gonna fuck me or what?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cRomance really is dead.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAirplane bathroom. Biological imperative. Not really romantic.\u201d His fingers shake a little as he tries to undo the other guy\u2019s belt and fly.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to fuck just because you\u2019re </span>\n<em>\n<span>wet</span>\n</em>\n<span>,\u201d and there\u2019s something about the way that he says it that almost feels\u2026 derogatory. In a hot way. But Yoongi has his pride, and he frowns. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou\u2019re right, we don\u2019t have to. You can leave if you want.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cDo you want me to?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cDo you want to?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou\u2019re really contrarian, did you know that?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Yoongi shrugs. \u201cProbably, if I knew what that meant.\u201d He resumes his mission to get this guy\u2019s slacks off or at least down enough that his belt buckle and zipper don\u2019t dig into Yoongi\u2019s ass while this happens. Because this is happening. He doesn\u2019t expect it, though, when there\u2019s a strong grip on his waist that spins him around and presses his hips against the sink. He bites back a groan as his cock gets pushed against the side of the sink while the guy grinds against his ass. \u201cEasy with the goods, asshole.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou seem pretty mad about the fact that you really want me to fuck you.\u201d But he eases back, pulling Yoongi with him and replacing the hard edge of the sink with the soft press of his palm, and Yoongi is </span>\n<em>\n<span>gone</span>\n</em>\n<span>. He presses back against the guy at the same time he pushes his palm down harder, and Yoongi moans low in his throat, wondering how hard he\u2019d have to grip the sink before it breaks in his hands because he\u2019s pretty sure he\u2019s gonna reach that point before he gets any satisfaction. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>He inhales deep, letting the bitter smell of coffee wash over him, excite him and calm him all at once, and he flushes when he finds himself baring his neck subconsciously. Luckily, the only response he gets is a pair of fat lips sucking the column of his neck, threatening to draw bruises that Yoongi knows will embarrass him at the conference. \u201cNo marks. I got - work stuff.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cSorry. You\u2019d look really good with them,\u201d he mumbles against Yoongi\u2019s skin and there\u2019s a different sort of knot in Yoongi\u2019s stomach because so far, it really has all been chemical to him. He\u2019d assumed this guy just wanted to stick his dick in a slick omega and that he got off on their little banter, but the compliment catches him off-guard and he stutters out a thank you. He watches in the mirror as Tall, Dark, and Handsome\u2019s hands travel to the fly of Yoongi\u2019s jeans and begin to unbutton and unzip. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAre you sure you want me to fuck you? Don\u2019t want you to regret it just because you think you have to.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Yoongi squints. That\u2019s\u2026 kind of him. It\u2019s a low fucking bar, but considering the assholes Yoongi\u2019s hooked up with before, being given an out when the guy is literally thirty seconds from getting his dick wet is\u2026 nice. It takes him a moment to realize the hands on his zipper have stopped moving, and he\u2019s actually supposed to answer. They make eye contact in the mirror, and Yoongi bites the inside of his cheek. God, he looks so </span>\n<em>\n<span>small </span>\n</em>\n<span>in comparison, with this guy curled around his back, arms caging him in as they wait. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNo, I\u2019m good. No regrets so far. Depends on your stroke game, I guess.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>The smile he gets in response is far too cute for the circumstances. \u201cThen I guess you won\u2019t have any regrets.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Yoongi groans in annoyance. \u201cPut the alpha attitude back where it came from.\u201d His jeans and underwear are tugged down in one swift motion, and his own petulance is bitten back immediately because he feels nothing but vulnerable right now.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>He jumps when two fingers slide up the inside of his thigh, but they don\u2019t stop, continuing up into the meat of his ass, pushing between his ass until they can push in steadily. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cJesus, you really are wet. I smell that good to you?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI - I don\u2019t know, I guess.\u201d Yoongi can\u2019t really think straight. The fingers are unnecessary, and they both know it, but the guy seems to be taking none too little pleasure in fingerfucking him, curling them inside him and scissoring as his other hand slides up to Yoongi\u2019s shoulder and pushes him forward at an angle. \u201cI just - ah - really like coffee -\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>He realizes belatedly that he hasn\u2019t gotten a look at the cock that\u2019s about to be pushed inside him, and he\u2019s never thought he had any special kinks in particular, but the idea of getting fucked by a man he doesn\u2019t know in a public restroom at approximately 40,000 feet is really doing it for him right now. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>He resolves not to be embarrassed when he feels more slick build up and spill out of him directly onto the tip of the guy\u2019s cock. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cJesus.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIn my defense, I\u2019m not usually -\u201d Yoongi inhales sharply as he pushes in, and he\u2019s far thicker than he thought he\u2019d be, and he wonders if the reason he isn\u2019t so over-the-top alpha is because he\u2019s already secure in it. No need to talk big when - \u201cFuck, how </span>\n<em>\n<span>big </span>\n</em>\n<span>are you?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cSorry, sorry. I\u2019m almost in I - I swear.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cJust -\u201d Yoongi huffs, pushing himself back that last little bit until he feels too full to even move. \u201cOh god. </span>\n<em>\n<span>Fuck</span>\n</em>\n<span>. You\u2019re some sort - fucked up hentai creature -\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>There\u2019s a huff of laughter, and Yoongi\u2019s head lolls back between his shoulderblades as he pulls out slowly just to push back in, and it\u2019s torture, absolute torture, and Yoongi can\u2019t wait to cum from it. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAren\u2019t you just a messy boy,\u201d the guy mutters, and Yoongi totally </span>\n<em>\n<span>hates </span>\n</em>\n<span>the shiver that runs through his veins. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cMessy </span>\n<em>\n<span>man</span>\n</em>\n<span>,\u201d Yoongi mutters back, trying to scowl at his reflection in the mirror but only finding he can\u2019t make eye contact with how intently the man seems to be watching his own cock slide out nearly all the way before pushing back in too slowly for Yoongi\u2019s liking. He honest to god whines then, before he can stop himself, and a large part of him still hopes the plane crashes as soon as he gets to cum. He only gets a moment\u2019s warning, a fleeting second of eye contact but he\u2019s being pushed forward with the force of a real thrust, and his hands are no longer on the sink, but on either side of the mirror, and the tip of his cock rests over the basin of the small sink.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>He watches himself leak precum little by little, drops splattering on the off-white plastic. He doesn\u2019t have much time to think about it when eight perfect fingernails dig into his hips at once and hold him in place as he gets fucked. When he can think straight, he\u2019s gonna build a list of things he hates about this guy, another thing being that no, his stroke game is definitely something Yoongi doesn\u2019t regret. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>He\u2019s so thick Yoongi can feel that his body hasn\u2019t quite adjusted to the reality of it, but it\u2019s certainly on its way. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou smell so fucking good.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Yoongi whines at the praise. The small bathroom smells like chocolate and coffee, and the sound of skin on slick on skin is disgustingly loud, so Yoongi tries very hard not to add his own moans into the mix. The last thing he wants is for this to end because they got caught. \u201cThought I smelled like dirt.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYeah, but - the good kind.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Yoongi can\u2019t help a small laugh even as he crosses his arms on the mirror and rests his head on it. He bites gently into the meat of his arm to avoid whimpering when it changes from fast, desperate thrusts, to slow and powerful ones, punching little moans and grunts out of him every time hip bones thud against the meat of his ass. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Yoongi wishes momentarily he were on his stomach, crushed under the weight of this guy as he fucks him into the mattress. He watches a steady stream of his own precum spill into the sink. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAre you getting close?\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Yoongi scoffs. \u201cWhat? No.\u201d </span>\n<em>\n<span>Yes</span>\n</em>\n<span>. \u201cYou\u2019ve - barely put any work in.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>There\u2019s a pause, and Yoongi panics thinking he\u2019ll pull out before they\u2019re done, but instead he\u2019s surprised with an arm under his leg pulling it up until it\u2019s on the counter and a tentative hand at the base of Yoongi\u2019s neck as he\u2019s held down. The stretch is more work than he\u2019s done in months to be honest, essentially celibate except with a little help from Jin through his heats, but the burn in his thigh does nothing to detract from the pressure of being held down or the drag of the cock in him.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOh my god - are you - are you gonna knot?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>There\u2019s another pause, and maybe Yoongi\u2019s imagining the swelling inside him. \u201cDo you want me to?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cDo you want to?\u201d It rolls off his tongue almost before the other guy finishes asking his own question.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOnly if you want me to, but you should hurry up and decide.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou just want me to beg.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cBegging is up to you.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cJust - fucking knot me, okay, Christ.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou sure?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Yoongi nearly screams in frustration, but instead he lowers his voice and growls. \u201cPlease fucking knot me before I lose my goddamn mind.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>His stomach flutters at the smile he catches in the mirror. The guy buries himself deep, dropping his head in the back of Yoongi\u2019s hair and inhaling, and Yoongi can </span>\n<em>\n<span>smell</span>\n</em>\n<span> the difference as soon the knot really starts to swell, pushing him past his edges into uncomfortable pleasure. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI\u2019m gonna -\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI know, buddy, I can tell,\u201d but Yoongi still gasps the moment he feels the guy start, pumping wave after wave of cum inside him, and god it\u2019s gonna be messy, so disgustingly messy, and Yoongi wishes he was somewhere he could really enjoy that. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>He rolls his head back to rest on the man\u2019s shoulder, and whines at the teeth in his neck and the hand around his cock. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWow, you really were leaking from both sides huh.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cDo you think that\u2019s sexy? What you\u2019re saying? Because - it\u2019s not.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cJust an observation.\u201d It makes the slide much easier as his grip edges on too tight, almost as if he knows exactly how Yoongi likes it, and that\u2019s just another thing he\u2019ll add to the list of </span>\n<em>\n<span>hot but annoying</span>\n</em>\n<span>. \u201cSo fucking messy. Bet you like it that way, that\u2019s why you asked me to knot you.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYe - yes, </span>\n<em>\n<span>yes</span>\n</em>\n<span>. Fuck.\u201d Yoongi looks down to watch that far too pretty hand squeeze his base and pump, pushing drop after drop of precum out of him and into the sink. The knot is driving him crazy, finally at its fullest, and it\u2019s so far inside him that Yoongi can\u2019t think straight. The guy has the audacity to grind forward to situate himself, and Yoongi gasps as he sees the tip of his cock push against the front of Yoongi\u2019s stomach. \u201cOh my god.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>He reaches a hand down tentatively pushing against it, and they both groan in unison. The frustrated, surprise squeeze he gets on his cock at the same time is enough to have him cumming, gasping as he writhes with nowhere to go. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Every breath has him swallowing down coffee and chocolate, and it smells so good and heavy, so bitter with a tint of sweetness, that it\u2019s making Yoongi hungry. He wants to revel in it, and unfortunately, once the post-orgasm calm settles in he realizes he can. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOh no.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>There\u2019s steady breathing against his neck, then a lazy, \u201cHm?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cDid you fucking knot me?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201c</span>\n<em>\n<span>What</span>\n</em>\n<span>? You asked me to!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWell - yeah but - now we\u2019re stuck here.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cShouldn\u2019t have asked, then.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Yoongi frowns, having no excuse. He hangs his head again, tracing his finger over the slight bulge in his lower stomach. \u201cFuck.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cQuit it, I\u2019m sensitive.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cDon\u2019t be such a baby.\u201d He rests his hands his hands on the sink for awhile, pulling his mouth to the side in the awkward silence that follows. \u201cSo\u2026\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cSo. I\u2019m Namjoon.\u201d The guy turns his hand to face Yoongi in an awkward handshake that Yoongi accepts before realizing it\u2019s still covered in cum. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cUgh.\u201d He scrapes it on the edge of the sink and turns on the faucet to wash his hands, moving out of the way, trying not to let the hitch of breath be too audible when Namjoon pulls his arms in tight so he can wash his hands as well. \u201cI\u2019m Yoongi.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI don\u2019t usually\u2026 do this. So I\u2019m not actually sure what people usually do in this situation.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cUh, I\u2019ve had hookups, but this is definitely a little different, so we\u2019re both out of our depth on this one.\u201d He shifts to adjust himself, and Namjoon lets out a strained </span>\n<em>\n<span>mmph </span>\n</em>\n<span>as he clenches his eyes shut. \u201cSorry. You\u2019re kinda\u2026 big.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThanks.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI didn\u2019t say it was a good thing. Maybe it\u2019s a bad thing. Now I can\u2019t get comfortable on your stupid\u2026 monster dick.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cRight. It\u2019s a terrible thing.\u201d Namjoon inhales sharply when he presses the heel of his palm down on his knot inside Yoongi one more time, and Yoongi bites his lip. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThought you were too sensitive.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThought you hated my hentai level monster dick.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cStop - just stop saying things.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThe only things I\u2019m saying are the things you already said.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou are so fucking frustrating.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Namjoon smiles sheepishly, like this isn\u2019t the first time he\u2019s heard this. Yoongi can make out the dimples in the reflection, even with the shitty fluorescent bathroom light, and he\u2019s cute. God, he\u2019s cute. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cSo. Where you headed?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHawaii - oh, you already know that. I just have some work to do there for my management company.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYeah?\u201d Yoongi pats the outside of Namjoon\u2019s thigh until they\u2019re both delicately shuffling over and he can prop his chin up with his elbow on the counter. He can\u2019t see Namjoon anymore, but he can smell him and feel him and hear him, and that\u2019s\u2026 nice. It\u2019s nice. \u201cWhat do you do?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cSales director, what about you?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cMarket research and analysis. Head of my department, too.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOh, what\u2019s your department?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Yoongi pauses, trying not to laugh. \u201c... Market research and analysis.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOh. Right. You know, I\u2019m usually pretty smart, I swear. I did become sales director through hard work and talent, not these good looks.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThat\u2019s admirable. I got entirely where I am based on my good looks.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI could see that.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Yoongi turns to look at him incredulously over his shoulder, but he seems unfortunately sincere so Yoongi turns away to hide his blush. \u201cYou\u2019re annoying.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou\u2019re mean.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI\u2019m - Sorry. Nervous.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Namjoon\u2019s hands run up and down his sides in a soothing pattern. \u201cI was just messing with you. My friends are far worse, so you\u2019re good. Plus they don\u2019t let me fuck them, so you\u2019re like\u2026 miles ahead of them in likability so far.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAlways feels good to be a winner.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>They chat for a while, going from favorite kinds of music to food to random childhood memories, the kind of shit that you can only real-talk about with someone who\u2019s forcibly attached to you for at least fifteen minutes. Yoongi finds him way more interesting after listening to him speak. He\u2019s got a unique cadence where he\u2019ll slow down as if he\u2019s looking for the right word, but speed up and break in strange places because he gets overly excited about some things, and for the first time, Yoongi\u2019s kind of\u2026 </span>\n<em>\n<span>sad</span>\n</em>\n<span>. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>He smells good, he looks great, and he\u2019s actually likable. Of course they\u2019re strangers and bound to stay that way. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOh. I think it\u2019s going down now.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Yoongi perks up. \u201cOh, okay, so like as soon as you pull out, you need to leave.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhat?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cLook, I\u2019m not having you in here for the embarrassing after-effects. You pull out, you wipe off, and you get out. Cool?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOh. Got it.\u201d He leans over to lift the lid of the toilet up, probably to make it easier for Yoongi, but Yoongi groans and covers his face in shame. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cStop. It\u2019s embarrassing.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI mean, you say that, but that\u2019s </span>\n<em>\n<span>my</span>\n</em>\n<span> cum and a lot of it, so I\u2019m not too surprised by this turn of events.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Namjoon does pull out eventually, shooed away quickly and viciously by Yoongi with barely any time to clean himself off, but when Yoongi eventually makes his way out of the bathroom and back to his seat, Namjoon doesn\u2019t seem too upset about it. He gives Yoongi a quick smile, but his cheeks are deep red and he leans in to whisper against Yoongi\u2019s ear. \u201cI think the couple in the back row are very disappointed in us.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Yoongi raises his eyebrows and leans into the aisle, looking back to see a woman glaring immediately in his direction. He gives her a tight-lipped smile and settles back in his seat. \u201cSucks. Probably just jealous,\u201d he tries to play off his embarrassment. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Namjoon chuckles and reopens his forgotten book, while Yoongi finally plugs his headphones back in and brings up Hoseok\u2019s story on his phone again, hopefully being able to concentrate better now that he\u2019s not fucking leaking. He laments the underwear that currently sits in the airplane bathroom trashcan and the feeling of denim against his still-sensitive skin. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>It\u2019s nice, actually, for a while. It\u2019s quiet and smooth, and Yoongi nearly forgets that Namjoon was knot-deep in him just an hour or two ago except for the comfortably sated feeling in his bones. Namjoon gets up to legitimately use the restroom at one point, and Yoongi quickly draws the flight attendant, asking for a particularly dark roast coffee. All they have is the standard, slightly watered down fare but Yoongi accepts the cup still, black with two sugars, in a poor imitation of what he actually wants.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>If Namjoon has a comment about the coffee when he gets back, he keeps it to himself. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>At some point Namjoon falls asleep, and Yoongi grits his teeth at the low rumble of snoring that comes through his headphones, so he turns up his music and continues reading until the smell of coffee strengthens and there\u2019s a soft thump on his shoulder where Namjoon\u2019s head now lays. It\u2019s probably creepy - actually, it\u2019s </span>\n<em>\n<span>definitely </span>\n</em>\n<span>creepy - when Yoongi downs his now lukewarm coffee and shifts in his seat, letting the familiar bitter smell roll over him as he closes his eyes. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>With a few minutes of steady breathing and the weight of Namjoon on his shoulder, Yoongi\u2019s asleep quickly enough. He\u2019s sitting up in one of the most uncomfortable seats of all time, denim-on-dick contact, trapped inside a tin can at 40,000 feet, but Namjoon\u2019s scent is like pulling a blanket over him and tucking him in, warm and soft and familiar. He groans into the feeling of it, like stretching out in a slept-in bed when you know you have plenty of time left before you need to get up. That feeling of burrowing back into the mattress, pulling the pillows close.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Sliding one between your thighs and gently grinding into it. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>He turns in his sleep, and the smell of coffee is overwhelming. He opens his mouth to gasp it in, and he feels so </span>\n<em>\n<span>good </span>\n</em>\n<span>that it takes him embarrassingly long amount of time to realize he\u2019s being shaken awake. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>When his eyes finally force themselves open, Namjoon is staring down at him, and Yoongi\u2019s body has the fucking audacity to tremble, pulling a whine out of his throat before he can do anything about it. Namjoon clamps a hand over his mouth, with deep red cheeks and looking around in a panic before he uses his other hand to pull out Yoongi\u2019s headphones. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou - your smell - I think you\u2026\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>And Yoongi realizes what he\u2019s saying, and it hits him all at once, the way his cock pushes against the front of his jeans uncomfortably and he\u2019s damp between his legs.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cFuck. Oh my god.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Namjoon nods. \u201cYou were - making noises\u2026 so I tried to wake you up. You\u2019re a heavy sleeper, did you know that?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cFuck.\u201d Yoongi sits up quickly, shoving his phone in his pocket and looking up and down the aisle to find that most people are also asleep by this point or buried in their own phones or books. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWere you\u2026 dreaming?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Yoongi\u2019s head snaps back to look at Namjoon with a scowl. \u201c</span>\n<em>\n<span>Shut up</span>\n</em>\n<span>. If you didn\u2019t shove your dry ass scalp directly into my </span>\n<span>olfactory receptors, this wouldn\u2019t be a problem.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Namjoon stifles his laugh in his hand. \u201cYou really like my smell </span>\n<em>\n<span>that </span>\n</em>\n<span>much.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI don\u2019t - I don\u2019t like it, it\u2019s just -\u201d How the fuck does he explain that he\u2019s physically never been so attracted to an alpha\u2019s scent in his life, and it\u2019s more than just liking, and it\u2019s more than just finding comfort, something in him out of his control physically craves it. \u201c... really strong.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNo one else seems to think it\u2019s that strong.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWell everybody\u2019s different,\u201d Yoongi answers distractedly as Namjoon leans in again. \u201cLook, guy.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNamjoon. My name, it\u2019s Namjoon.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI know that, I didn\u2019t hit my head on the way out of the bathroom.\u201d </span>\n<em>\n<span>Please stop licking your bottom lip, I am begging you.</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou smell\u2026 really strong too\u2026\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Yoongi inhales sharply, wondering how he\u2019s gonna get the mess out of his jeans now. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Ten minutes later, Namjoon sits on layers of toilet paper on top of the toilet lid while Yoongi sits firmly in his lap on his knot, simultaneously annoyed and content as he continues reading the story on his phone. Namjoon\u2019s arms are around his waist because they have nowhere else to be, and Yoongi lets himself selfishly enjoy it for now. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cDo you knot every fuckin\u2019 time?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNot usually, no.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Yoongi takes a small pride in that. His good mood lasts for only a moment, halted immediately by a knock on the door, followed by a muffled, </span>\n<em>\n<span>Sirs</span>\n</em>\n<span>? Yoongi blushes red hot, burying his face in his hand as Namjoon clears his throat.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI\u2019m - So sorry, please give us, um, like ten minutes? I\u2019ve -\u201d Namjoon clamps his mouth shut and buries his head against Yoongi\u2019s back.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201c</span>\n<em>\n<span>Oh</span>\n</em>\n<span>.\u201d The flight attendant says in understanding. \u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Ten of the longest minutes of Yoongi\u2019s life later, he sits on the toilet, chin propped on his palm, frowning in pure, pure, </span>\n<em>\n<span>pure </span>\n</em>\n<span>embarrassment as he catches snippets of Namjoon\u2019s defense. Apparently, Yoongi is now Namjoon\u2019s partner hit with an unexpected preheat that\u2019s making him nearly insatiable - Yoongi has half a mind to open the door and punch him - but he should be fine for the remainder of the flight. </span>\n<em>\n<span>No more coffee for him, though, please</span>\n</em>\n<span>, Namjoon says.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Yoongi could kill him. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>When he finally opens the bathroom door, Namjoon stands just outside, giving him two thumbs up and smiling. \u201cWe\u2019re not barred from ever flying again! As long as we can control ourselves from now on.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWell at least I can get home after this, then. Good to know.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Yoongi gives another, wider smile to the woman in the back row as he passes. \u201cShe hates us,\u201d Yoongi whispers to Namjoon as they take their seats. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cFor someone who hates us, she sure was extremely interested in listening to me talk to the flight attendant.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cFuck you for that, by the way. Always so easy to blame the omega.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cBelieve me, if I was in rut, they\u2019d know.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Yoongi flushes at the idea of Namjoon in rut, refusing to look up from his phone. \u201cI\u2019m gonna finish this. Thank you, for uh\u2026\u201d He vaguely waves his hand. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cMy pleasure.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cStop.\u201d Yoongi pulls the hood of his jacket up, zipping it all the way up to under his nose and nestling into his own smell for the remainder of the trip. He rereads the same section for the tenth time, trying to pick the plot back up again, all the while refusing to let himself breathe fresh air, instead stifling himself inside his hoodie. The torture ends years later it feels like, when the flight attendant\u2019s soothing voice comes overhead announcing their descent and Yoongi puts his seatbelt back on. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>The landing is bumpy again, and every deep breath brings a little more Namjoon in with it, but he can\u2019t find it in him to complain because it\u2019s the only thing that keeps him sane and calm. He grips his armrest and hums to himself, knowing he\u2019s being overdramatic and trying to rationalize that if anything were to fail at this point, a crash landing at this height wouldn\u2019t even be that bad. They\u2019re already technically going down. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cSo what were you reading?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhat?\u201d Yoongi looks at him, confused.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThe thing you kept reading on your phone, can I ask what it was?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOh, just - my friend writes books but he\u2019s doing a collection of short stories and I told him I\u2019d proofread this and give some feedback.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHow is it?\u201d Namjoon wraps his own headphones around his phone and struggles to get under the seatbelt so he can put it in his pocket. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIt\u2019s, uh - pretty good. Not really my favorite genre, a little too much mushy lovey dovey bullshit for my taste, but\u2026 cute. And well written. You should buy it when it comes out.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhat\u2019s his name? I\u2019ll look him up.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cJung Hoseok, he\u2019s got a few books -\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOh, no shit? I\u2019ve read his stuff before, that\u2019s really cool. Tell him you met a fan on your way to Hawaii.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cTell him I </span>\n<em>\n<span>fucked</span>\n</em>\n<span> a fan on my way to Hawaii.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Namjoon smiles, the barest hint of a blush on his cheeks as the plane bumps into its landing and begins to brake. \u201cLanded alive.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Yoongi blinks. \u201cDistraction method. Very clever.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>It takes a few more minutes before everyone begins shuffling to their feet, pulling their bags from overhead, \u00a0and filing out in a barely ordered manner. Yoongi and Namjoon hesitate - or maybe it\u2019s just Yoongi - waiting to have more space to collect their things, and being reluctant to meet the flight attendant\u2019s judging eye. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Namjoon walks slightly behind him, an awkward shuffle with his laptop bag and bookbag thrown over his shoulders, and Yoongi with a duffle bag bumping against his hip. Yoongi can\u2019t help but blush when the omega flight attendant looks at him again with something a little worse than judgement instead, giving him a soft, pitying look when Namjoon rests his hand on the small of Yoongi\u2019s back.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThank you again. We\u2019re so, so sorry about that. Honestly, thank you so much for understanding.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou guys get somewhere safe, have a great day. Enjoy Hawaii if you can!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Namjoon smiles for the both of them, rubbing his hand gently on Yoongi\u2019s back as they step into the small corridor and head into the airport.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHow did you get her to believe that?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIt was pretty easy, actually. You trying to get away from me and my scent, ordering coffee, the fact that you shamelessly had me knot you twice on public international transport.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Namjoon\u2019s hand is still on his back and Yoongi doesn\u2019t want to broach the subject, but they\u2019re heading toward the luggage pick-up and they can\u2019t keep going together forever. Yoongi has a conference, Namjoon has whatever the fuck he has. It ends here.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>He reaches forward to get his suitcase and frowns. \u201cSo. Was nice to meet you, Namjoon.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou, too.\u201d He drags his own suitcase off the conveyor belt and turns to shake Yoongi\u2019s hand. \u201cWeird situation but a very cool story, for sure.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cFor sure.\u201d Yoongi wants to smell him again. He hates that he wants that. He purses his lips in annoyance, the corners of his mouth tucking in, as he stands frozen in place until someone gently nudges behind him to get their own suitcase. He mutters an apology, tensing as Namjoon\u2019s scent gets stronger in front of him and there\u2019s suddenly a hand on his side. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou\u2019re not </span>\n<em>\n<span>actually </span>\n</em>\n<span>going into preheat are you? Because I could swear -\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cShut the fuck up,\u201d Yoongi nearly growls in embarrassment. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Namjoon moves them out of the way of people bustling around them, and leans down to speak much too close to his ear. \u201cHow - Can I -\u201d He sighs. \u201cIs it\u2026 bad etiquette to ask -\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNo, it\u2019s good. Good etiquette.\u201d </span>\n<em>\n<span>Such a polite boy</span>\n</em>\n<span>, Yoongi thinks as he drags his suitcase behind him to the nearest bathroom and Namjoon follows just a step behind. He should probably be embarrassed, out of everything he\u2019s done so far, to walk to the furthest stall and put his suitcase just outside the door, well within sight from underneath the stall door. He should </span>\n<em>\n<span>probably </span>\n</em>\n<span>feel embarrassment, some sort of disgust, at putting his duffle bag on the closed toilet lid, but it\u2019s better than the ground. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>But he doesn\u2019t. Instead, there\u2019s an anxious pause, and Yoongi is tense and growing hard as he wrings his hands in anticipation because maybe he\u2019s a little selfish and he </span>\n<em>\n<span>absolutely </span>\n</em>\n<span>wants one more time. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>The bathroom smells clinically clean, like new sneakers or freshly unwrapped plastic, and Yoongi can\u2019t fucking stand it, but once the bathroom quiets of footsteps and overly powerful hand-dryers, Namjoon\u2019s outside the door and pushing it open softly. He closes it behind him, sliding the latch closed before he\u2019s on Yoongi, grabbing him by the waist and pulling him in for what is technically their first kiss. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Yoongi hadn\u2019t really thought about kissing him too much, honestly. He\u2019d been more concerned with\u2026 other endeavors, but he can\u2019t take back the soft moan that escapes when Namjoon\u2019s hands grab his ass and pull him forward into a kiss that has Yoongi wrapping his arms around Namjoon\u2019s neck. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou really like the idea of public sex, huh?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNot really, just like the idea of fucking you.\u201d Yoongi lets him graze his teeth along the line of Yoongi\u2019s neck. \u201cUnfortunately, the entirety of our interaction has - fuck,\u201d he gasps when Namjoon bites </span>\n<em>\n<span>just</span>\n</em>\n<span> off-center, just not </span>\n<em>\n<span>quite</span>\n</em>\n<span> close enough to mate. Yoongi hates his body for wanting it so bad, but he can\u2019t deny the full-body shiver he got in that moment. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Yoongi kicks off one shoe and steps on the hem of his jeans as he struggles to pull his leg out. \u201cCome on, we don\u2019t have all day, Namjoon.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cGod, I\u2019d like to, I wouldn\u2019t hate fucking you all day. I mean, we kinda already have.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Yoongi thinks about Namjoon helping him through a heat and he hates his life a little bit more in that moment. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou\u2019re so wet, Yoongi, aren\u2019t you worried about ruining another set of clothes, baby?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Yoongi channels his sexual frustration into aggression, setting his jaw when he glares. \u201cI hope your dick falls off after this.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cRight. </span>\n<em>\n<span>After</span>\n</em>\n<span> this.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI\u2019m pissy, not stupid. Fuck me.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you say it a little louder so the whole airport can hear you?\u201d But Namjoon grips the backs of his thighs and hoists him up, thudding his back against the wall. Yoongi wraps his legs around Namjoon\u2019s waist, only slightly annoyed at having to put forth the effort while Namjoon uses one hand to line up so he can push in. The annoyance dies pretty quickly. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>It\u2019s different fucking face-to-face because now Yoongi can really see the stupid way that Namjoon\u2019s jaw hangs slack, his fat bottom lip shining with spit, and the way he closes his eyes, drawing his eyebrows together in concentration. He looks ridiculous. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>He looks cute.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Yoongi kisses him again even though it makes it harder for Namjoon to thrust. At least Namjoon has a common smell, something Yoongi can easily replicate once he gets home - not that it\u2019s something he should do, chasing after an alpha\u2019s smell with no relief is bound to drive him crazy and fuck up his heats, but something about it clicks in his gut and prickles the back of his neck. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cStop presenting yourself.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cFuck, sorry, it - good -\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Namjoon laughs, a huff of breath against Yoongi\u2019s neck, and his whole body shudders. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cGonna miss how wet you get. No one\u2019s ever been so messy for me.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cBiology,\u201d Yoongi reasons, only half catching himself when he bares his neck again. He growls in frustration, bringing his head upright again and burying his face in Namjoon\u2019s neck. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou\u2019re not even in heat, Yoongi. Just want my bite that bad?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWant you to shut the fuck up.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cDo you?\u201d Namjoon stops, and Yoongi groans, trying to urge him to move, but Namjoon holds him still. \u201cC\u2019mon. Do you?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Yoongi frowns. \u201cWhat, you want me to beg?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cA little. Will you?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNo.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAre you telling the truth or just being obstinate.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cTruth.\u201d Yoongi digs his heels in to try and force Namjoon to move. It doesn\u2019t work.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWould you beg in heat?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Yoongi blushes bright red, and Namjoon gets his answer.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cGuess I\u2019ll just have to imagine it, then.\u201d He fucks into Yoongi almost ruthlessly, sliding him up the wall, and in the distant recess of Yoongi\u2019s mind he thinks how utterly gross that is, but Namjoon\u2019s cock slides in and out so easily, spreading him open and filling him up, and he arches his back off the wall, pushing his ass more flush with Namjoon\u2019s hips. \u201cJerk yourself off.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNo - no, wanna -\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThat\u2019s romantic, but I can already tell I\u2019m gonna knot again, so you need to cum or this is going to be embarrassing.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cUgh, can you </span>\n<em>\n<span>not\u2026</span>\n</em>\n<span> knot? Can\u2019t you just cum like a normal fucking person?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Namjoon frowns and tries to balance Yoongi with one hand and jerk him off with the other, nearly dropping him or worse before Yoongi smacks his hand out of the way. Namjoon smiles in triumph, but truthfully, Yoongi doesn\u2019t feel too bad about losing this time as he works his own cock and lets Namjoon suck hickey after bruise after hickey along his neck. In this moment, he couldn\u2019t give a shit less about how tight he\u2019s gonna have to wear his tie or how high he\u2019s gonna have to pull his collar because he feels so good. He doesn\u2019t realize he\u2019s whispering </span>\n<em>\n<span>please</span>\n</em>\n<span> over and over until Namjoon\u2019s voice is in his ear, telling him - </span>\n<em>\n<span>sounds even better than I imagined</span>\n</em>\n<span>. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>He cums a second later, biting Namjoon\u2019s shoulder and twitching as he rides out his orgasm. He tries to catch most of it, and luckily there\u2019s not much this time, but it still manages to drip down his shaft, sticky and verging on uncomfortable and exactly the way Yoongi likes it. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cFuck,\u201d he breathes. \u201cFuck.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Namjoon stills a moment later. \u201cI won\u2019t knot you again because you have places to be, but I really want you to know that I absolutely wish I could.\u201d He grabs Yoongi\u2019s bag quickly and drops it on the floor instead. \u201cSince you had your fair share of embarrassment so far today, it only feels fair -\u201d He pulls out and lowers Yoongi to the ground on shaky legs. He takes a moment before leaning in one last time to kiss him. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Yoongi tries </span>\n<em>\n<span>real</span>\n</em>\n<span> hard not to be sentimental about it. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>It\u2019s a little easier when he watches Namjoon jerk himself off with hunched shoulders and a lazily curled hand, until he begins to swell and drip streams of cum into the toilet. Yoongi awkwardly reaches for toilet paper, cleaning off the cum and slick between his legs, and drops it into the same toilet where Namjoon still stands holding his knot. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou could at least pretend to not be judging me right now.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI could.\u201d Yoongi instead reaches out a hand and drags a finger across up the length of Namjoon\u2019s cock, making him shudder and sputter. Yoongi frowns in disappointment, already missing it, and struggles to pull his jeans back up in the small stall. \u201cI gotta\u2026\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNo, no, it\u2019s cool. I figured you wouldn\u2019t stand here while I\u2026 suffer. Um, ignore this,\u201d he gestures vaguely to his dick and his current situation, \u201cbut it was really. Really nice. So. Thank you? Sorry this ended so weird.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIt\u2019s fine. It\u2019s not too weird.\u201d Yoongi reaches down to get his bag, only feeling disappointed at the waste of cum. \u201cUh\u2026 Bye? Forever, I guess?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Namjoon frowns. \u201cYeah, I guess. Nice meeting you.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYep.\u201d Yoongi stands for a moment. \u201cUm.\u201d He darts in one more time for a kiss that Namjoon doesn\u2019t even have time to reciprocate before Yoongi is pulling away and opening the door just enough to get out. Namjoon closes and locks the stall behind him and Yoongi drops the bag momentarily so he can wash his hands again before gathering all his luggage and leaving.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Every step feels heavier than the last, and he stops at Starbucks on his way out of the airport. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>He spends the cab ride to the hotel watching the scenery pass by and thinking about how utterly stupid he is. It\u2019s the 21st century, he could\u2019ve gotten a number or a twitter or a skype - god, he tries not to picture jerking off on camera for Namjoon. He frowns ever deeper, a perpetual look for him, as he brings the coffee to his lips. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>He pays the cab driver, shuffles dejectedly through check-in, up the stairs, and into his room that\u2019s nice enough on the company\u2019s dime, then lets his hand hover on the bathroom door for a moment. He wants to shower. He really does. It\u2019s calming and cleansing after flying, but Namjoon\u2019s scent is all over him, and he\u2019s not quite ready to lose it yet. He lets his hand drop and strips out of his jeans and puts on a pair of boxers, turning the air conditioning down low as he sets an alarm and climbs into bed, letting the minor jet lag hit him full force. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>He sleeps like the dead and wakes up much the same way. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>He cracks his eyes open into the dark cold of the hotel room, snug and comfortable in his shirt, hoodie, sheet, and blanket, and he doesn\u2019t wanna get up yet. He reaches to check his phone, realizing he\u2019d never turned off airplane mode. Jimin probably thinks he\u2019s dead. Taehyung probably thinks he ran away. Jin\u2019s probably busy consoling both. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>He turns off airplane mode, turns on do not disturb, then rolls back over and goes to sleep until his alarm can wake him. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>He wakes up again, hours later, just as stiff and twice as sore now. He reluctantly stands, stretching to the extent that his body will let him before he falls back down on the bed and curls around his phone. Jimin and Taehyung, crying. Jin, begging him to answer his phone before they accidentally burn down the office. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Yoongi smiles and sends a text to the groupchat. He deliberates a really long time before deciding that just this once, for the first and last time in his life, he will give them all something to talk about. A token of goodwill since he disappeared for nearly 24 straight hours. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<span>Landed alive. Joined the mile high club. Gotta get ready for the conference now :]</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>All three response bubbles pop up at once, and he locks his phone so he doesn\u2019t have to deal with it yet. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span> He inhales with his hoodie pressed against his nose before pulling it overhead and dropping it on the messy bed. The shower is nice. The unscented soap is disappointing. He steps out, and goes through his routine silently, trying very hard not to think about a tall man with a cute smile and pretty hands as he watches himself brush his teeth in the bathroom mirror. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Yoongi shrugs into his suit jacket, deciding against a tie because fuck it, he doesn\u2019t want to be stuck in an uncomfortable chair in an even more uncomfortable suit for several hours today just for some stupid management company expansion meeting. Sharing tips and tricks to expand their chains of hotels and luxury clubs, how to pull in demographics they haven\u2019t been able to figure out how to reach yet. Ah, the ever elusive Millennial. Why don\u2019t they travel more? Why are club numbers so low? </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Yoongi rolls his eyes thinking about every meeting he\u2019s sat through in the past two years at his job, trying to explain </span>\n<em>\n<span>we\u2019re broke</span>\n</em>\n<span> only to get disbelief in response. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>He\u2019s not even broke anymore, but he still lives in the broke mindset. He gets an almost childish glee from the fact that breakfast is included in his stay, and takes a seat at a table in the hotel dining area. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cCoffee, sir?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Yoongi nods. \u201cDo you guys have, um\u2026 like a really dark roast coffee?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cUm\u2026\u201d the waitress tilts back to look toward the kitchen. \u201cWe have robust, which is darker, if that counts?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Yoongi smiles. \u201cYeah, that sounds much better, thanks.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>He eats slowly, reluctant to go listen to a bunch of people drone on for hours about marketing. He\u2019s good at it, there is actually a reason he\u2019s the head of his department, but that doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s particularly passionate about it, so he savors a big breakfast and lets his thoughts drift. His coffee cup is halfway to his mouth, when he finds himself thinking again about getting knotted from behind - but vaguely, just blurred memories, so he doesn\u2019t get out of control - and he smells it. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>He sits up sharply and scans the room. It was Namjoon, like he\u2019s one thousand percent sure it was Namjoon\u2019s scent, but he doesn\u2019t see him anywhere. He spins in his seat and checks the lobby behind him, but no sign of him there either. He doesn\u2019t hope, writes it off as being some sort of sensory memory, and really it\u2019s his fault for daydreaming, but it still hurts a little as he settles back down and sips on the poor replacement in his cup. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>He leaves a couple dollars on the table for the waitress and sighs, heading toward the large ballroom at the end where he can already see through the door a shit ton of rinky dink metal legged chairs set up with a stage and projector screen.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Yoongi mills around for a moment, getting a bottle of water to battle the amount of coffee he\u2019s had in the past day, before taking a seat near the back middle. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<span>Thank you all for being here</span>\n</em>\n<span>, the guy says, and Yoongi rolls his eyes. He goes where the company sends him. Everyone was so jealous that he got to go to Hawaii but he literally gets one free day before he has to head back home, so while he\u2019s not ungrateful, he\u2019s also not all that excited. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Plane trip alone might have made it worth it, though, honestly. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>He\u2019s staring off at the empty tables to the side, \u00a0hands clasped over his crossed knees, already imagining lunch, when there\u2019s gentle clapping. It drowns out and there\u2019s fumbling with the microphone as the lights dim a little and the screen is lit up with a PowerPoint presentation. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThank you.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Yoongi\u2019s attention snaps forward almost immediately. \u201cOh my god.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cMy name is Kim Namjoon, and today I\u2019ll be talking about oh my god.\u201d Namjoon\u2019s eyes widen when he sees Yoongi raise his hand softly and wave. It takes him a moment to look away, his face much redder than it was before, and Yoongi\u2019s getting a few stares in response, but Namjoon apologizes for the stumble and continues onward. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Namjoon - is </span>\n<em>\n<span>here</span>\n</em>\n<span>. Namjoon is sales. Namjoon and Yoongi are\u2026 complete idiots. Namjoon is </span>\n<em>\n<span>sales</span>\n</em>\n<span>, Yoongi is market research which feeds into </span>\n<em>\n<span>sales</span>\n</em>\n<span>. Both on a business trip. Yoongi could die in his seat if he weren\u2019t already thinking about the possibilities. Namjoon manages to trip his way through his presentation, an </span>\n<em>\n<span>actually </span>\n</em>\n<span>useful guide to making hotels more palatable to millenials, and Yoongi thinks he might verifiably be in love because those are the exact ideas he\u2019d had before too. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>He scrunches his nose. Love is an exaggeration, but he feels uncomfortable exaggerating with how closely his feelings already resemble </span>\n<em>\n<span>like</span>\n</em>\n<span>. He doesn\u2019t even know this guy. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Yoongi frowns. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>He\u2019s definitely\u2026 gonna be slightly mean to him later, possibly. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>He claps gently as Namjoon wraps up his powerpoint and walks off the stage, down to where another kid is holding a seat for him. Namjoon turns around quickly, and his eyebrows pull together in confusion as he looks directly back at Yoongi. Yoongi has no other response other than to throw his hands up in equal parts confusion. He motions back to the stage for Namjoon to pay attention, laughing to himself when Namjoon rolls his eyes and turns around. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Sometime during the middle of the third speaker, Yoongi notices the hotel staff sneak in and begin setting up the lunch bar, and his heart soars. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>He\u2019s the first one out of his seat when lunch is announced, and he fills his plate up, wandering over to the next ballroom over where tables have been arranged. He\u2019s already halfway through eating, having glared at anyone who got near his table, when Namjoon finally makes his way through the door, only looking around a moment before finding Yoongi again. He smiles and turns to speak over his shoulder to the guy behind him, leading them both to Yoongi\u2019s table. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHey!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHey.\u201d Yoongi fights a blush when Namjoon takes the seat next to him, and the frown that comes after when he pulls it away a little further away before sitting down. In the commotion and the crowd, Yoongi can\u2019t really smell him, and it\u2019s driving him crazy. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHi!\u201d A third voice adds.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOh, Yoongi, this is Jungkook. Jungkook, Yoongi. My seat neighbor on the way over.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOh shit, cool coincidence.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou could say that,\u201d Yoongi says, stabbing a braised potato. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOur director of sales is out pregnant, and I\u2019m the only who works closest with her, and I\u2019m head of my department -\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOf course, how could I forget,\u201d Namjoon nods with a smile.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cShut up,\u201d but Yoongi shoves a three small potatoes in his mouth at once. \u201cHow do you guys\u2026\u201d He waves his fork between Namjoon and Jungkook.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI trained him before he transferred to another district, but we found out we were both coming here.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOh, that\u2019s actually\u2026 pretty cool.\u201d Yoongi nods. \u201cYou\u2019ve got lots of friends lots of places, Joon.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Namjoon raises an eyebrow. \u201cJoon?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cDamn, nevermind then.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNo, no, it\u2019s cute, I like it.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Jungkook looks between the two of them, realization dawning on him a moment later as he instead chooses to laser-focus on his meal. Yoongi wants to ask Namjoon about the airport, if he missed Yoongi as he stood over a public restroom toilet dripping cum, or maybe later, when he was climbing in bed did he miss Yoongi\u2019s smell like Namjoon missed his. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Namjoon\u2019s eyes narrow slightly. \u201cYoongi.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHm?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhatever you\u2019re daydreaming about, you probably shouldn\u2019t.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Yoongi blinks. \u201cHow did you - I feel\u2026 fine\u2026\u201d </span>\n<em>\n<span>Not wet</span>\n</em>\n<span>, he means. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou smell </span>\n<em>\n<span>strong</span>\n</em>\n<span>. I can smell you from here.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWell that\u2019s not really my fault, is it.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNo, but - You might not be -\u201d Namjoon tilts his head in place of a word, \u201cbut that doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re not making it - difficult.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAgain, not my fault. Jungkook seems fine.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cJungkook\u2019s a beta, Jungkook </span>\n<em>\n<span>is </span>\n</em>\n<span>fine.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cDon\u2019t bring me into this.\u201d Jungkook huddles over his plate and turns away. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Namjoon flicks the back of his ear in retaliation. \u201cUseless.\u201d He directs his attention back to Yoongi. \u00a0His gaze changes a little before he\u2019s scooting his chair closer inch by inch until he\u2019s barely too close, and Yoongi can finally really smell him, and it\u2019s so </span>\n<em>\n<span>much</span>\n</em>\n<span>, it\u2019s better and warmer and fuller, and Yoongi wants to bury his face in the scent, and -</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou asshole,\u201d Yoongi grits his teeth as Namjoon smiles, </span>\n<em>\n<span>grins</span>\n</em>\n<span>, wide and triumphant. \u201cI was </span>\n<em>\n<span>fine</span>\n</em>\n<span>.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWell, I wasn\u2019t, so get on my level.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou\u2019re not the one -\u201d Yoongi lowers his voice, \u201cleaking from his </span>\n<em>\n<span>asshole </span>\n</em>\n<span>right now.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cPlease, I love it when my partner talks all dirty.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI\u2019m not your partner.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNot yet. Or\u2026 maybe I should say you already were? What\u2019s the rules on this?\u201d Namjoon swallows and Yoongi follows the movement with his gaze.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYet.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhat?\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Yoongi looks up from his throat to his lips to his eyes. \u201cYou said not yet.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI\u2019m leaving,\u201d Jungkook states loudly, taking his empty plate with him. Namjoon barely gives him a glance before turning back to Yoongi, and leaning forward to rest his elbows on his knees and let his fingers turn Yoongi\u2019s hand palm-up. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou\u2019re being\u2026 extremely forward.\u201d Yoongi tries desperately not to choke on his own spit.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWell, there\u2019s only 45 minutes left for lunch so\u2026\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cSo?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cSo I usually knot for fifteen, but you already know that.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cShut the fuck up,\u201d comes out all at once, in a burst of air like Namjoon had just punched him in the gut. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI\u2019m just saying we\u2019re wasting really valuable time right now.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cEveryone\u2019s gonna know why we left.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIt\u2019s possible, but also they\u2019ll be here while we\u2019ll be\u2026 not here.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Yoongi hums like he\u2019s considering it, like he isn\u2019t already mentally ten minutes in the future on his hands and knees already. He takes another bite and mulls it over, watching Namjoon\u2019s face as he raises a glass of water to his lips. \u201cNot sure I\u2019m willing to get fired for you.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWe won\u2019t if you hurry up.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Yoongi sighs as if the whole thing is a burden, as if Namjoon isn\u2019t the #1 thing he wants to do today, as if he isn\u2019t sitting slick between the thighs right now. He only brought so many pairs of underwear, honestly. So he sets his glass down, he puts his napkin on his empty plate, and he pushes his chair back, struggling slightly on the shorthair carpet. Namjoon laughs at him a little, but Yoongi refuses to look at him, instead leading the way quietly out of the banquet room and back into the lobby. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou\u2019re walking kinda fast.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cSubconsciously trying to get away from you.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cToo bad we\u2019re going to the same place.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWho knows, I might slam the door in your face still. It\u2019s a long walk.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Namjoon watches him as they step onto the elevator. \u201cDoes alpha strength intimidate or impress you?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNeither, it exasperates me. We work in hospitality and sales, you\u2019re not some brute and I\u2019m not\u2026 whatever is attracted to a brute. I don\u2019t know.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Namjoon smiles, sliding immediately behind Yoongi and letting his hand rest on Yoongi\u2019s waist as they continue toward his room. \u201cSo you weren\u2019t impressed when I fucked you up against the wall, huh?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Yoongi swallows, pausing in front of his door as he struggles to get his room key out of his pocket. \u201cGod damn it\u2026\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHaving problems?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYes, you\u2019re getting on my nerves,\u201d Yoongi snaps, immediately regretting it. He doesn\u2019t want Namjoon to hate him, he doesn\u2019t want him to leave, but he\u2019s reaching a point where he can\u2019t quite think straight and it\u2019s not exactly fair. Namjoon doesn\u2019t turn and leave though because a moment later, Namjoon\u2019s fingers wrap around Yoongi\u2019s hand and pull the card away. Yoongi wants to be proud, mad that Namjoon\u2019s treating him like a child, but Namjoon\u2019s chest is flush against Yoongi\u2019s back, and his arm is around his waist, and he\u2019s effortlessly unlocking the door and opening it before slipping the key back in Yoongi\u2019s pocket. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cCome on, baby.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Yoongi bites back his objection and accepts the blush on his cheeks. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>As soon as the door latches shut, Namjoon has him turned around and is shoving at the suit jacket until it falls on the floor and Yoongi\u2019s stumbling backward over it. Yoongi tries valiantly to lose his shoes and socks at the same time that he\u2019s unbuttoning his dress shirt, and Namjoon nearly headbutts him in his rush to unbuckle his belt. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cCareful.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cKinda funny we can fuck in three square feet, but can\u2019t manage to navigate in an entire hotel room.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>It does actually make Yoongi laugh a little, and Namjoon catches him off-guard a moment later when he ducks in for a kiss, and it feels like a whole other level of satisfaction. As the amount of clothes between them becomes less, the prickling feeling under Yoongi\u2019s skin heightens and keeps him warm. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI thought about you. Couldn\u2019t jerk off again, but I really wanted to, if that counts for anything.\u201d Namjoon removes Yoongi\u2019s last piece of clothing, a pair of boxer briefs that sticks to the slick on his thighs as Namjoon drags a nail up the inside soft skin between Yoongi\u2019s legs until it slips under the hem to peel the cloth off. \u201cGod\u2026 Either no one\u2019s ever wanted me like you do, or everyone else is just really good at hiding it.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI obviously - wear my heart on my sleeve -\u201d Yoongi gasps when Namjoon gently shoves him onto the mattress, grabbing his thighs and pulling him down the bed until his ass is flush with the edge and Namjoon is dropping to his knees. \u201cWhat are you -\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Namjoon answers with a broad lick on the inside of Yoongi\u2019s thigh, taking a stripe of slick with him. \u201cI cannot\u2026 believe\u2026 you literally taste like dark chocolate.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Yoongi digs a hand into Namjoon\u2019s hair as his mouth moves further inward, and manages a small little laugh. \u201cNo one\u2019s ever said that.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Namjoon only hums a sound of surprise, as he pushes up the back of Yoongi\u2019s thighs. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cTaste is - taste is - partly smell? So maybe - ah - oh god - </span>\n<em>\n<span>Joon</span>\n</em>\n<span>, please,\u201d Yoongi can\u2019t help but whine as Namjoon\u2019s tongue curls and pushes inside him. He sucks the rim before rolling his tongue back inside as he digs his nails into the meat of Yoongi\u2019s thighs. \u201c</span>\n<em>\n<span>Please</span>\n</em>\n<span> -\u201d Yoongi doesn\u2019t quite know what he\u2019s asking for. As much as he wants more, he already feels so good. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Namjoon pulls back a moment to kiss the inside of Yoongi\u2019s thigh. \u201cI mean, I hate to call you a liar, but I thought you didn\u2019t beg.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Yoongi has a thousand different insults resting on the tip of his tongue, but they\u2019re all silenced when Namjoon darts up to kiss him. It should be disgusting, but Namjoon\u2019s skilled with his tongue, and eager to please as he wraps his hands around Yoongi\u2019s waist and drags him up the bed.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI can\u2019t - I can\u2019t taste it, it doesn\u2019t taste like anything.\u201d All Yoongi can smell, the only thing he gets every time he inhales, is Namjoon\u2019s scent, and it makes him hungry in so many ways. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI promise it\u2019s so good, I knew you\u2019d taste good. Wanted to eat you out so bad yesterday. You were so fucking messy,\u201d Namjoon finally takes off his own slacks and underwear and suddenly they\u2019re both a lot less frantic and a lot more nervous as Namjoon settles above him. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cUm,\u201d Yoongi lays frozen with his hands on his stomach. \u201cNot to sound like a 45 year old housewife but can we get under the covers? It\u2019s really cold\u2026\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Namjoon laughs, loud and obnoxious, and it makes the edges of Yoongi\u2019s lips pull tight in a wide smile. \u201cAll these little demands, we\u2019re running out of time, Yoongs.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWell I guess you better hurry up, then.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou know, that\u2019s actually the first time someone told me to hurry up and cum. God, do you ever like, transcend to another spiritual and religious level when you feel cold hotel sheets?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cFuck yes, what is it about hotel beds?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI have no idea but I wanna ruin this one with you.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOh, very smooth.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cKinda like your thighs.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Yoongi shivers even under the covers when Namjoon leans in close and slides his hand between Yoongi\u2019s legs, rolling partially on top of him and sliding two fingers inside him. He pushes and crooks them until Yoongi\u2019s breath picks up, stretching out into a whine when Namjoon manages to find his prostate, gently massaging it as he props himself up to watch the change on Yoongi\u2019s face. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI thought we were running out of time,\u201d Yoongi manages as he squirms under Namjoon\u2019s hands. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI\u2019m your typical selfish alpha, sorry. I highly doubt they\u2019ll fire me for being a few minutes late.\u201d He pauses, looking off in the distance before shrugging and continuing anyway. He stays with two fingers, rubbing them in circles, pushing in lightly then pulling back as he moves, and Yoongi\u2019s legs shake as he tries to keep holding them open. \u201cYou are so wet, Yoongi, Jesus. Does it feel that good?\u201d He pauses, and a moment later his voice is softer and closer, his breath ghosting past Yoongi\u2019s ear when he asks, \u201cDid you miss me that much?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Yoongi opens his eyes into a glare. \u201cI just met you yesterday.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cBut that doesn\u2019t answer the question, does it?\u201d Namjoon pushes Yoongi\u2019s legs further apart and situates himself between them on his knees, pulling his fingers out and using Yoongi\u2019s slick to slide his hand from the base of his cock until he\u2019s mixing it with the precum that gathers at the head. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cTime,\u201d Yoongi reminds, even though he can\u2019t take his eyes off the way the tip pushes between Namjoon\u2019s fingers as he toys with himself. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWe\u2019ll pick this conversation up later, then.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Yoongi agrees as he lets Namjoon lift his thighs and push them toward his chest. \u201cFuck. Later.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Namjoon lines up and pushes in, in an all too familiar way that makes them both groan in contentment. He doesn\u2019t waste any time settling in, instead pushing in fully and setting a rhythm immediately. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>It\u2019s so strange, it was a day ago, only one day, but Yoongi can\u2019t believe he really had missed Namjoon as much as he did. He wraps his arms around Namjoon\u2019s shoulders and drags him down, burying his face in Namjoon\u2019s shoulder and whining with every thrust, whining in a way that he absolutely hates, but Namjoon smells so good, and feels so good. Everything just - works. All the pieces, they just slot together so right, and it has Yoongi\u2019s mind feeling a little hazy. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>He\u2019s never particularly liked sex, actually.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Honestly sort of hated his body for telling him what he needed and punishing for not getting it. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Right now though, in his momentary haze, he doesn\u2019t hate the way his body makes way for Namjoon. He doesn\u2019t cringe at the squelch every time Namjoon thrusts in, and he loves every point where Namjoon\u2019s skin touches his. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHey, you okay?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHuh?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Namjoon pulls back to look at him. \u201cYou\u2019re weirdly quiet. Is it - not good? Do you actually need the public sex aspect to enjoy it?\u201d He tries to laugh but Yoongi can see the crease of worry on his brow. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Yoongi takes a breath. \u201cI hate to inflate your ego, but I\u2019m willing to beg you to keep going right now.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou sure?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Yoongi nods. \u201cYou like it when your partner makes noise?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI like it when you make noise. I want you to feel good. Do you?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYeah. Yeah, I do.\u201d He swallows. He feels way too vulnerable when he manages to speak the truth, he always has. \u201cOr at least I would if you kept moving.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Namjoon smiles again, just as beautiful as ever, and leans down to kiss Yoongi as he begins moving again, fucking him far too slowly for Yoongi to get any satisfaction. But he loves it. It\u2019s not hungry like the airplane, or desperate like the airport, and it\u2019s a little too self-indulgent for the schedule they\u2019re on right now, but Namjoon\u2019s getting his teeth dangerously close the the crux of Yoongi\u2019s neck, pressing, playing, but not claiming, and it\u2019s driving Yoongi crazy. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>He wants to ask. He wants to beg for it. He starts to, but Namjoon draws his lips up, back to Yoongi\u2019s mouth. Namjoon\u2019s hand surprises him when he wraps around his shaft and begins moving. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cDon\u2019t think I forgot about your messy boy fixation.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cStop,\u201d Yoongi manages to blush at the memory, but Namjoon\u2019s watching the change on his face.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cSorry, I know you wanted me to call you messy </span>\n<em>\n<span>man</span>\n</em>\n<span>. Fucking wet and dripping for me, making such a mess, Yoongi.\u201d Namjoon tsks and it goes straight to Yoongi\u2019s gut. \u201cMaking a mess all for me, right, baby?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cFuck - you -\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Namjoon\u2019s hands shift to Yoongi\u2019s sides, nails digging into his skin as he begins pulling him down to meet every thrust. If he was trying to draw noise out of Yoongi, it\u2019s certainly working, pushing low grunts from the bottom of his throat as he grips the pillow behind him. \u201cYou smell so good, fucking hell, Yoongi, do you even </span>\n<em>\n<span>know</span>\n</em>\n<span>.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>He does know. Namjoon\u2019s scent is so heavy Yoongi can feel it on his tongue, and for the first time he can faintly smell his own bitter heady chocolate mixed in, and they smell so good together that it makes Yoongi let out an uncharacteristic sob. He wants, he wants it, and he can\u2019t - doesn\u2019t - stop himself from turning his head and stretching his neck out. It\u2019s possibly, literally, the most irresponsible thing he\u2019s ever done, and he\u2019s made several irresponsible decisions in his life. But he thinks about how good it\u2019d feel if Namjoon\u2019s teeth dug in and broke skin, marking him and scenting him and claiming him.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cFuck, you can\u2019t do that, I can only say no so many times.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>He knows Namjoon\u2019s right, they shouldn\u2019t mate unless they\u2019re in love, stable, together, healthy. Not strangers in a hotel room. So why, he wonders, does it hurt his feelings so much when Namjoon rejects him. He brings his hand down quickly, covering his neck and muttering an apology.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHey, don\u2019t do that.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cDo what.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Namjoon brings one hand to the other side of Yoongi\u2019s neck, and uses the other hand to expose his skin again, pulling Yoongi\u2019s hand away and pinning it to the mattress as he sucks a bruise against his pulse. \u201cDon\u2019t be mad. Don\u2019t think I don\u2019t like you.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Yoongi doesn\u2019t mean to cum, but Namjoon thrusts in at the same time that his teeth press down hard, and Yoongi\u2019s body clenches in anticipation. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cSo pretty,\u201d Namjoon mutters against his skin. \u201cGot cum all over yourself. Fucking mess.\u201d His tone drops, a little sharp and mean at the end, and Yoongi inhales sharply. He wonders if it\u2019s something they\u2019ll explore more later. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Later. Again. Fuck, after the conference ends for the day. Yoongi looks at the clock, recognizing that they only have about ten minutes before lunch ends. They\u2019ll definitely be late, but better late than never. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cCome on, Joon, knot me for real this time.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI thought about this,\u201d Namjoon speaks softly, like he doesn\u2019t need Yoongi to hear it as he pushes himself back up onto his knees. \u201cWanted to get you in a bed so bad, instead of those gross fucking bathrooms.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Yoongi had wanted the same. He wants to stop having the same idea as Namjoon. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Namjoon puts Yoongi\u2019s legs against his chest, holding onto his waist again as he chases his own orgasm. Yoongi shifts in oversensitivity and lets out an </span>\n<em>\n<span>ah</span>\n</em>\n<span> when Namjoon grazes his prostate again, it\u2019s too tender, but it\u2019s not long before Namjoon is losing his rhythm and getting close. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOh no.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOh no?\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI\u2019m - cumming,\u201d Namjoon raises his eyebrows in panic.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYeah, that\u2019s sort of the point.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNo, I\u2019m -\u201d He gasps, letting Yoongi\u2019s legs drop as he falls onto his hands and thrusts lightly to ride it out. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>It takes a moment for Yoongi to realize. \u201cAre you </span>\n<em>\n<span>fucking kidding</span>\n</em>\n<span> me?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI know, I\u2019m sorry!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThe whole point was the knot, Namjoon.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI can\u2019t knot every single fucking time! I\u2019m not a machine, Yoongi.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI gave you a whole day to recover -\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou </span>\n<em>\n<span>gave</span>\n</em>\n<span> me, like you made the conscious decision -\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWell, I guess we just have to back like normal fucking people, now.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThat is the opposite of what this means. Give me like ten minutes and we\u2019re doing this again.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Yoongi raises his eyebrow. \u201cIf you didn\u2019t knot the first time, why do you think you will the second time?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI was nervous, okay?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAre you sure you\u2019re not more nervous now after arguing?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNo, I want to fuck you even more but my stupid dick won\u2019t cooperate, so we\u2019re gonna wait it out. Understand?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou wanna get in trouble just to prove how good of an alpha you are?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOh my god, we\u2019re in Hawaii, this isn\u2019t work, this is a corporate circlejerk. I\u2019d rather skip the corporate circle part and skip right to the jerking if you don\u2019t mind.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Yoongi hadn\u2019t realized he was fighting a smile as Namjoon was talking, but Namjoon smiled back. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou think I\u2019m hilarious.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI think you\u2019re a trainwreck.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou let a trainwreck fuck you.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYes, I did.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Namjoon chuckles and pulls out, slipping out of the covers much to Yoongi\u2019s annoyance and coming back with a warm washcloth. He hands it over, and Yoongi thanks him for saving at least a little of Yoongi\u2019s pride. \u201cSex is so gross.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cGod, absolutely.\u201d He hides himself under the cover as he cleans between his legs. \u201cI feel like I have it a little worse, though.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNo, I can definitely agree to that.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Yoongi blushes, hesitantly handing back the rag. \u201cUm\u2026 can you get me another one?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Namjoon nods, taking it and coming back with a fresh one so Yoongi can finish while Namjoon stands awkwardly to the side, looking anywhere else. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOkay.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cGood?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYeah, thanks. You may lay with me now.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOh, may I? Are you sure you\u2019re not asking me to?\u201d But Namjoon still lifts the blanket and slides across the mattress, instinctively wrapping his arm and leg over Yoongi\u2019s body. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOh my god, you\u2019re clingy.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYes.\u201d He pulls Yoongi impossibly close to him, and his scent is a little different now, a little muted and soft like he\u2019s not trying to overpower Yoongi, but lull him to sleep. Yoongi can\u2019t help but turn - rolling onto his side with a struggle from how heavy Namjoon\u2019s limbs are - so he can bury his nose in it. He\u2019s so sleepy and mindless in the moments after sex, he doesn\u2019t stop himself from nuzzling against Namjoon\u2019s neck, trying to take it, keep a part of that smell for himself, and maybe leave something of himself behind. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Namjoon\u2019s hand appears on his cheek, and Yoongi\u2019s embarrassed for a moment, thinking he\u2019s asking him to stop, before Namjoon guides his face up until they can kiss again. It hurts. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>It\u2019s soft and slow and a little too tender, and Yoongi hurts. \u201cYou know what really fucking sucks?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Namjoon hums. \u201cIs it the concept of time and space itself?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cBasically.\u201d Yoongi rolls to lay on his back again, staring at the ceiling in annoyance. \u201cThanks for like\u2026 not mating me, mid-fuck. I really appreciate that.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHonest to god, that might have been the most self-restraint and patience I have ever had, and one time I won one of those car things where you have to be the last person touching the car to win it. Took me like two days. I was literally dehydrated by the end.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOh shit, you won a car?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYeah! I still drive it actually.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThat\u2019s something you don\u2019t hear everyday. Best thing I ever won was the office coloring contest - don\u2019t ask, it was my coworkers\u2019 idea - and that\u2019s only because I cheated. In my defense, I wanted to win the most, so.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhat\u2019d you win?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cGift card to the fast food place of my choice.\u201d He remembers the anger on Jin\u2019s face as he tried to convince their boss he cheated, and how it had gotten worse when he was chastised for being a sore loser. The hamburger he got in apology did nothing to temper his rage. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cFuckin\u2019 worth it.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAbsolutely agree.\u201d He tries to steady his breathing as Namjoon absentmindedly traces the line of his bottom rib with his thumb. \u201cI think I like you, and that feels like shit.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Namjoon isn\u2019t surprised by the thought. \u201cY\u2019know, I was kinda feeling the same way, and I was thinking about it a little, you know, once I was able to think straight without your ass drawing my attention -\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cShut up.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201c- and I mean. We used the same airport so worst case scenario, we\u2019re only a few hours from each other? I didn\u2019t want to say anything and seem like </span>\n<em>\n<span>that</span>\n</em>\n<span> hookup, like the immediately super-clingy one -\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou say that, but I literally can\u2019t breathe right from your octopus grip.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201c- but I guess it just feels. Um. Different or whatever.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Yoongi swallows. \u201cOr whatever.\u201d He knows what </span>\n<em>\n<span>whatever</span>\n</em>\n<span> is, he knows exactly what they haven\u2019t mentioned. The stronger scents, the incessant need that worked its way under their skin, the way Yoongi wanted to be claimed so bad he almost forced Namjoon\u2019s hand. A mate in the traditional sense. A lot of people mate as a verb - marriage or best friends or accidental hookups and suddenly you\u2019re tied to each other forever - but Yoongi remembers it as a noun. </span>\n<em>\n<span>A</span>\n</em>\n<span> mate, </span>\n<em>\n<span>his</span>\n</em>\n<span> mate - and he\u2019d been trying really fucking hard </span>\n<em>\n<span>not</span>\n</em>\n<span> to remember that. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Namjoon had done the right thing refusing to claim him in the heat of the moment, but Yoongi feels it in his gut that even if he had, Yoongi couldn\u2019t bring himself to be too upset about it. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cSo, what district are you actually from?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNortheast. You know Manager \u00a0Minseok?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Yoongi turns to him quickly. \u201cAre you serious? That\u2019s right next to my district.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWell, that could still be a few hours away depending on where we both live.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Turns out, it\u2019s not. Turns out, actually, that Kim Namjoon, Director of Sales, lives exactly one hour and thirteen minutes away from Min Yoongi, Head of the Department of Market Research and Analysis. Turns out that Yoongi ends up slinging his leg across Namjoon\u2019s waist and bending down to kiss him until they can\u2019t breathe and Yoongi can feel Namjoon half-hard underneath him.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThat is extremely convenient,\u201d Namjoon muses when Yoongi\u2019s mouth travels down Namjoon\u2019s chest instead. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNo, extremely convenient would be the same apartment complex. </span>\n<em>\n<span>Barely</span>\n</em>\n<span> convenient is what we got.\u201d But he\u2019ll take it graciously. An hour away is weekends together. An hour away is someone to help him through his heats. He looks up at Namjoon as he slides down between Namjoon\u2019s legs and wraps a hand around his cock, still slightly soft. He feels good, less weighed down and more excited about possibilities, and he smiles to himself before tracing the tip of his tongue on the underside of the head. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Namjoon\u2019s hand rests on his stomach, flexing and tensing when Yoongi sucks the tip in gently. He works his way down, inch by inch, relishing the way that he can feel Namjoon get harder in his mouth. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>There\u2019s a faint buzzing sound that they both try to ignore before Yoongi sighs, pulling back and sliding off the bed, patting around his slacks then Namjoon\u2019s before he can find the offending phone. \u201cYours,\u201d he says as he tosses it. Namjoon curls up instinctively, saving himself from getting an iphone to the dick, and doesn\u2019t manage to answer it in time. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIt was Jungkook. Probably wondering where we are, if we\u2019re coming back anytime soon.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAre we?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI would hope not at this point. Come here.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Yoongi does, shuffling onto the bed on his knees and straddling Namjoon\u2019s stomach. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cClose, but just like - a little lower.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNo shit. Hold on.\u201d Yoongi takes his time, sitting flush against Namjoon\u2019s pelvis, ignoring the way his slick makes their skin tacky between them. He drags his blunt nails down the length of Namjoon\u2019s chest, a little soft and a little broad, and he likes the way Namjoon shudders softly beneath him. \u201cYou\u2019re pretty attractive.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI had some inclination, actually, what with the way you keep getting hard for me and everything.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou\u2019re so\u2026 attractive\u2026 until you open your mouth.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cDon\u2019t be rude -\u201d Namjoon lets out an </span>\n<em>\n<span>mmph </span>\n</em>\n<span>when Yoongi leans down quickly to kiss him. He doesn\u2019t fight it, just lets Yoongi\u2019s tongue slide into his mouth and work its way around as one of Yoongi\u2019s hands rests on his chest and the other reaches behind him and wraps around Namjoon\u2019s dick. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>He pulls back reluctantly, leaning down one more time for another shorter kiss before finally sitting back and sinking down to rest with Namjoon\u2019s cock inside him. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cCan I ask a personal question?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI mean, you\u2019re already at least six inches inside me, so -\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cSix inches? Fuck you, I\u2019m a solid eight and that doesn\u2019t include knotting.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cChill out, alpha dog, your dick is plenty big. Ask your stupid question.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cUm, this sounds - I\u2019m not trying to be rude - has anyone ever called you um, well.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOh my god, are you okay? Just spit it out.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cKnotslut.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Yoongi\u2019s fist immediately makes minor contact with Namjoon\u2019s chest. \u201cOffensive.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAh! My tiddy! I was just asking!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhy, do I seem like one?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI mean the only thing that makes someone seem like one is like\u2026 loving knots and you seem,\u201d Namjoon motions his hand vaguely. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Yoongi tries not to think about all the times Jin specifically has called him that through his heats and made him beg for it. He\u2019s sure Namjoon will that side of him soon enough. His next heat is just a few months out anyway. \u201cMaybe if I like you more, we\u2019ll talk about it.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNo, no. We don\u2019t have to. I\u2019m not like, super into dynamics and shit. I\u2019m not really into calling people names. Except baby, you seem to like that one.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Yoongi can\u2019t help but blush. \u201cShut up.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cTo which I respond with the requisite </span>\n<em>\n<span>make me</span>\n</em>\n<span>,\u201d Namjoon smiles as his fingers dance up Yoongi\u2019s thighs to come to rest on his hips. Yoongi gasps and frowns when Namjoon bucks up, forcing Yoongi\u2019s hands to land on either side of Namjoon\u2019s head. \u201cI\u2019m gonna fuck you.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOkay.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAnd then I\u2019m gonna knot you?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHow is that a question. Yes, you\u2019re gonna knot me.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAwesome.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cJust move, dumbass.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Namjoon frowns a little.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cSorry, you\u2019re not a dumbass. You\u2019re very smart. Please move your penis.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Namjoon continues to pout. \u201cI am smart.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou are. I like you a lot.\u201d Yoongi begins to whine. \u201cCan you </span>\n<em>\n<span>please </span>\n</em>\n<span>move?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI don\u2019t know, I kinda like this. Would you beg?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWell, now I won\u2019t.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou did last time. It sounded so pretty, baby.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>It\u2019s like a twist in his gut every time Namjoon uses that against him. He hates how easy he is.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWill you beg just a little for me?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201c... Please move, I\u2019m now literally begging you.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Namjoon raises an eyebrow at what they both know was a pisspoor attempt. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNamjoon, please fuck me. And knot me. Cum inside me, yada yada yada.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWe were so close.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou\u2019re gonna go soft if you don\u2019t hurry up.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cBelieve me, that is not a possibility right now. God, you\u2019re hot.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Yoongi blinks quickly. He\u2019s been called a lot of things in his life, but hot has never really topped the list. Namjoon\u2019s looking at him like he means it though, and Yoongi decides to reward him. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNamjoon\u2026 please fuck me, I want you to knot me, please.\u201d He rocks back trying to get friction and Namjoon lets him, watching intently as Yoongi reaches a hand back to massage Namjoon\u2019s balls. \u201cI want everyone to know exactly where we were and how good you made me feel so many times since I met you, I wanna smell like you. Please?\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Namjoon nods quickly, lifting his hips again to meet Yoongi\u2019s ass, setting a quick pace from the beginning and fucking up into Yoongi so hard it jostles him forward a little bit each time, but it\u2019s so good. He can\u2019t keep his eyes open or his mouth shut, and he\u2019s worried about how needy he sounds with each whine that falls out of his mouth, but Namjoon\u2019s wrapping his arms around Yoongi\u2019s waist and pulling him down to meet it time after time. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cFuck, so good, Joon, it\u2019s so good.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Namjoon growls, low in the back of his throat, and Yoongi didn\u2019t think he was into that before but Namjoon\u2019s teeth are buried in his shoulder a second later, so close to where he really wants them, and he cries out, pulling the back of Namjoon\u2019s hair reflexively to get him off.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>It deteriorates from there, with Namjoon almost throwing Yoongi onto his back and fucking into him as Yoongi nips at Namjoon\u2019s neck. He gasps when Namjoon pulls his teeth from Yoongi\u2019s shoulder and instead darts forward to return smalls bites along his ear and the column of his throat. He doesn\u2019t mean to do it again, to turn his face and tilt his head until his neck is laid bare. But he feels Namjoon\u2019s teeth toying with the crux of his neck. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIt\u2019s a bad idea.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Yoongi gasps, his legs clenching on either side of Namjoon. \u201cIf you say so.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIt is </span>\n<em>\n<span>such </span>\n</em>\n<span>a bad idea.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cProbably.\u201d Yoongi drags his teeth along Namjoon\u2019s shoulder as his hand grips Namjoon\u2019s arm to stay grounded. \u201cFuck.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>It\u2019s so much better than any other time, with Namjoon\u2019s teeth just barely pressing against his skin, teasing a mark. Teasing a mate. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cSo fucking wet for me, baby. Gonna be so messy when my knot goes down. Such a messy fuckin\u2019 boy, but you love it don\u2019t you?\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cJoon - fuck - please,\u201d he asks for something, burying one hand in the back of Namjoon\u2019s hair. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou really want it?\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Yoongi nods, and his gut tightens in anticipation. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou gotta tell me. Wanna hear it, baby.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cPlease, knot me. Please -\u201c he hesitates, turning his face face shyly into Namjoon\u2019s neck and muttering against his skin, \u201cmate me?\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>He yelps when Namjoon\u2019s teeth sink into the meat of his neck, and he bites back in frustration, riding out the whine of pain and pleasure that shudders through him. It\u2019s so fucking good, it feels like he\u2019s on fire, and he can barely register that Namjoon\u2019s still slowly moving in and out of him. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>He pulls out a moment later and flips Yoongi onto his stomach. The air on his new bite stings but Namjoon\u2019s weight is on his back a moment later, and his mouth gently sucks at the small amount of blood he\u2019d caused. \u201cYou\u2019re okay. You\u2019re doing so good.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Yoongi nods. </span>\n<em>\n<span>So</span>\n</em>\n<span> good. He grips the sheets beneath him as Namjoon continues to fuck him from behind, soothing the ache and burn of the bite with his tongue. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>He can feel Namjoon starting to swell, and he keens at the idea of being pumped full. He\u2019s not exactly sure where he picked up an unfortunately filthy kink, but face-down and fucked out probably isn\u2019t the right time to start psychological dissecting himself, so instead he turns his face toward Namjoon, who kisses his cheek then his earlobe before pulling it with his teeth. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cCome on, Joon. Come on.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Namjoon pushes into him deep, one more time, before he stills, and Yoongi can see the way his arm shakes where it\u2019s propped up next to him. It\u2019s almost disgusting how full he feels, how he can feel the cum trapped inside him as Namjoon\u2019s knot continues to grow. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Namjoon tips them onto their left side, one arm trapped underneath Yoongi and wrapped around his stomach, and his right hand coming to wrap around Yoongi\u2019s erection and begin moving loosely. \u201cCan you cum for me now?\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cClose -\u201d So close as Namjoon kisses the slightly sweat-damp hair at the back his neck, whispering and pushing him further. It\u2019s Namjoon pressing down on the front of his stomach tentatively, feeling just the tip of his knot pushing against it, that has Yoongi digging his short nails into Namjoon\u2019s forearm as he cums into his palm. He groans as his body tries to pull away from the sensation of Namjoon working him through it, but the knot holds him still, and he stretches and whines, beginning to get pushed to the point of oversensitivity. \u201cJoon - Namjoon -\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cSorry,\u201d Namjoon mutters against his neck, nuzzling his chin over the bite mark on Yoongi\u2019s shoulder. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Yoongi reaches over to the nightstand with a shaky hand and uses the cold washcloth to clean himself up. He winces at the contact, but he can\u2019t get up, so he powers through it, and Namjoon has the decency to carefully reach behind him in a combination leg/arm effort until he can get the blanket over them both. Yoongi tosses the rag on the floor, promising himself he\u2019ll pick it up later to spare the poor housekeeper who already has to deal with these sheets. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAh - careful, please.\u201d Namjoon protests. Yoongi apologizes, but doesn\u2019t stop pushing on the spot where he knows Namjoon\u2019s knot rests just beneath. \u201cYou\u2019re weird.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cShut up.\u201d He inhales, the softest constant scent of coffee and nearly melts into the bed. Namjoon\u2019s hand slowly petting the outside of his hip doesn\u2019t help. His fingers softly scratching a pattern on his stomach makes him hazy. He </span>\n<em>\n<span>should </span>\n</em>\n<span>regret asking Namjoon to bite him. He should really regret that. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Namjoon continues to soothe the bite, sucking on it lightly and placing a kiss against it every so often. \u201cYou okay?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Yoongi hums. \u201cI think so. I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll have a mild panic when I\u2019m back home, but I\u2019m good for now.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOh, great. That definitely set my nerves at ease.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI dunno. Feels right, though. And it\u2019s a little late now.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cDoes feel right, doesn\u2019t it.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cRomance really isn\u2019t dead. Amazing.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAre you ever not sarcastic for like thirty seconds?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI\u2019m unfortunately sincere most of the time, people just think it\u2019s sarcasm.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Namjoon buries his nose in Yoongi\u2019s hairline, as gross and sweaty as it is, and his breath tickles the back of Yoongi\u2019s neck til he\u2019s squirming. He pretends the flutter in his stomach is knot related, instead of butterflies from the way Namjoon\u2019s smile grows against his skin. \u201cDo you wanna get dinner later? Like with clothes on and in a public place where we literally can\u2019t fuck without getting arrested?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou\u2019re giving me all these hoops to jump through, I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s worth it.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI\u2019ll buy.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cSuddenly I\u2019m starving.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThat\u2019s too bad, I did say </span>\n<em>\n<span>later</span>\n</em>\n<span>. I\u2019m tired, let me sleep. And then, I\u2019m not gonna lie, I\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019m jizzed dry, but I really wanna go again.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWow, when you speak such beautiful words as </span>\n<em>\n<span>jizzed dry</span>\n</em>\n<span>, how can I possibly resist? Go the fuck to sleep so I can at least pretend this was a good idea.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIt was a good idea.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cStop frowning, you\u2019re making me anxious. It was a good idea. Go to sleep.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou don\u2019t sound convinced.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOh my god, go to sleep before I physically relax my asshole enough to escape </span>\n<em>\n<span>please</span>\n</em>\n<span>.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThat is one hell of an image. You\u2019re an amazing man, Yoongi.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>He bites his tongue, refusing to banter anymore so he can force Namjoon to sleep, and soon enough, Namjoon\u2019s breathing evens out, and his scent rests over Yoongi calm and light, lulling him to sleep too. If he wakes up a few hours later to Namjoon rocking into him slowly, his lips pressed against Yoongi\u2019s neck, he\u2019s not upset about it. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>______________________________________________________</span>\n</p>\n<p><br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Namjoon stands at the pick-up area with his bookbag like a child waiting for his mom after school, looking around nervously until a car comes to a cautious stop in front of him and rolls down the window.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cKim Namjoon?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYeah, that\u2019s me.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI\u2019m Hoseok, Yoongi sent me. You should probably get in the car like right now.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Namjoon makes for the door but it\u2019s locked when he pulls. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cShit, sorry.\u201d Hoseok unlocks and lets him in, taking Namjoon\u2019s bookbag and chucking it in the backseat. \u201cWe gotta hurry because Yoongi is </span>\n<em>\n<span>pissed </span>\n</em>\n<span>at you.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhat? Why! I didn\u2019t do anything.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHe went into preheat already, he gets crabby as fuck. I\u2019ve been trying to distract him with treats and porn, but all he wants is coffee and the porn made him horny. My bad.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Namjoon sighs. It\u2019s their first heat together, but nothing Hoseok\u2019s saying sounds out of the ordinary. He texts Yoongi that he\u2019s on his way and asks him if he needs anything. He nearly chokes and flips his phone out of sight when he reads Yoongi\u2019s response -</span>\n<em>\n<span> fucking hentai level knot shoved so far inside me </span>\n</em>\n<span>- .</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhat he say?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Namjoon shakes his head. \u201cNope. You don\u2019t need to know that. Also, hey, big fan.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cSo I\u2019ve heard! Nice to meet you. I\u2019ll get you a signed book or something.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>It\u2019s a nice ride. It\u2019s a short ride, thank god. When he walks into Yoongi\u2019s apartment, left unlocked for him, his knees nearly buckle at the deep warm smell of chocolate that hits him. He locks the front door behind him, throws his bag on the living room floor, and heads back to the bedroom where Yoongi has already noticed his presence and is whining at the top of his lungs. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNamjoon, where the fuck have you been, I\u2019m </span>\n<em>\n<span>dying</span>\n</em>\n<span>.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cSorry, baby. My sales trip was fine, thanks for asking. Hoseok picked me up at the airport and said he\u2019s gonna get me an autographed novel.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI\u2019m glad you had fun, please hurry.\u201d Yoongi\u2019s face barely peeks out from his cocoon of blankets but he leaves a corner open for Namjoon to climb inside once he\u2019s stripped down to nothing but a t-shirt and boxers. \u201cI...missedyou\u2026\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI\u2019m sorry what was that?\u201d Namjoon wraps himself around Yoongi\u2019s side, simultaneously burning even as his skin is covered with goosebumps. \u201cGod, you smell so good.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI missed you.\u201d Yoongi says, a little braver, a little weaker as he rubs the side of his face against Namjoon\u2019s neck and slides his hands underneath his shirt. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThat\u2019s gay - ow, </span>\n<em>\n<span>ow</span>\n</em>\n<span>, sorry, stop twisting, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Yoongi lets Namjoon\u2019s nipple go, and instead moves to kiss Namjoon as he pushes his boxers down his hips. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Namjoon kisses his chest when he bends down to get his boxers untangled from his ankles. \u201cMissed you too, baby.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cProve it, fucker.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI can\u2019t believe I\u2019m stuck with you.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYes you can. You deserve this fate.\u201d Yoongi yelps when Namjoon flips him onto his back and pushes his thighs apart. \u201cEasy, I\u2019m fucking sensitive.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHoseok\u2019s right, you are crabby.\u201d He pulls his shirt overhead and throws it somewhere on the floor.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Yoongi frowns. \u201cI am not. And if I were, it\u2019s because someone isn\u2019t using his monster boy dick to help me right now.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHow many times do I have to ask you to stop watching hentai without me?\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNam</span>\n<em>\n<span>joon</span>\n</em>\n<span>, please.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cStop whining, I got you. Calm down, baby, it\u2019s okay, I got you.\u201d He ignores the way Yoongi pulls his hair as he works his teeth over the mark he\u2019s permanently left. \u201cMissed you.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cMissed you, too.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cLove you.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Yoongi gasps as Namjoon pushes inside him all in one go, pausing to breathe once his hips are flush with Yoongi\u2019s. \u201cIf I weren\u2019t so turned on out of my fuckin\u2019 mind, I would say something really clever.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cJust say you love me, too, and I\u2019ll fuck you.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI love you, too, now please move.\u201d Yoongi refuses to acknowledge the blush on his cheeks but Namjoon kisses him softly anyway. It\u2019s not a requirement that he say it again and again, broken over whines and moans as Namjoon fucks him through his heat, but Yoongi finds himself doing it anyways. He even manages to say it outside of sex, when he drives Namjoon the hour and a half it takes to get him home, and when he calls from home once he gets back safely, and at the end of long phone calls where his body rests spent and wet and aching for Namjoon. </span>\n</p>"
