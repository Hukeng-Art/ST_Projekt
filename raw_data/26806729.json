  "text": "<p>Atsumu\u2019s muscles are screaming. The awkward angle of his spine is making his lower back tighten and threaten to cramp up. He hisses in a breath through his nose, tries to hold it deep in his chest before releasing it out through his teeth.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t push so hard. You\u2019ll hurt yourself,\u201d a voice from behind Atsumu whispers. \u201cIt\u2019s not a competition.\u201d</p>\n<p>His brow furrows further and sweat slides up his nose to disappear into his hairline. The blood is beginning to pool in his upturned skull, making Atsumu dizzy. He can do this. He can <em> do </em>this.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Atsumu\u2019s thighs and biceps are shaking now. Just a little longer; he can bear it a little longer.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOk\u2026 slowly lower your feet and then walk your hands forward to move into downward dog\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>Atsumu follows the instructions of the yoga instructor at the front of the room, looking through his legs at a smirking Osamu.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNot so easy is it, <em> Miya-senshu </em>?\u201d he teases before dropping his own head between his arms.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m <em> fine</em>,\u201d Atsumu hisses at the back of his smug brother\u2019s head.</p>\n<p>He should have never let his twin taunt him into this. Osamu\u2019s girlfriend from a few years back got him into yoga and Atsumu always thought it was mostly, like\u2026 meditation with shapes. What other option did he have but to show up when Osamu told him that he\u2019d suck at it?</p>\n<p>By the time the class ends, Atsumu is sweating buckets and his muscles feel like he just played a full match. Osamu doesn\u2019t demand or coax an admittance of defeat from Atsumu. Some might call it good sportsmanship, but in all honesty, they just know each other so well that the words are necessary. They both <em> know </em>Osamu won this one; a small smirk is enough to rub Atsumu\u2019s face deep in it.</p>\n<p>Back in front of the studio\u2019s small storage cubbies, Atsumu wipes his face with a towel.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cBet Suna\u2019d be killer at this,\u201d he murmurs.</p>\n<p>Osamu groans.</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell \u2018im about it. \u2018M already tired a\u2019seein\u2019 his dumb aesthetic posts on instagram.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNever knew how many different ways ya could make hotel coffee look artsy.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2018xactly. Can ya imagine the crow pose selfies?\u201d</p>\n<p>Atsumu can\u2019t remember exactly which one is crow pose, but he knows what Osamu means and hums his agreement.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He pulls his phone out to check his notifications, still mopping at his his neck with his towel. He\u2019s got a couple social media pings, a snapchat from Bokuto, and a text message alert that makes his heart skip a pathetic beat.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He opens that first.</p>\n<p><b>From: </b> Omi-Omi<br>\n&gt;&gt; Are you free on Friday after 8pm?</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2018Samu, what\u2019re our plans with Ma this weekend again?\u201d</p>\n<p>Osamu doesn\u2019t look up from where he\u2019s wiping down his yoga mat, one he actually <em> owns </em>. Atsumu made fun of him until he borrowed one of the studio\u2019s and started thinking about how many other people have sweated on it.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cBreakfast on Saturday. She wants us ta help her get some stuff outta the attic after, too.\u201d</p>\n<p>Atsumu swears quietly.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cTellin\u2019 Ma you cursed \u2018bout visitin\u2019 her.\u201d</p>\n<p>Atsumu ignores him. It takes about an hour from his place in Ohasuhigashi to get to their childhood home, which means he\u2019ll need to leave pretty early on Saturday. Going to Sakusa\u2019s and\u2026 doing what they do\u2026 followed by the trip home would mean a late night. Plus, who knows what the other man has in mind. Atsumu resists whining out loud as he forces himself to be a responsible adult with impulse control.\u00a0</p>\n<p><b>To: </b> Omi-Omi<br>\n&gt;&gt; If you want to know for the reason I think ya do, I probably can\u2019t come over. Going to see my family early Saturday morning.</p>\n<p>Atsumu can\u2019t help but leave himself open to be convinced. He shoots off another text, trying to crack the door open wider.\u00a0</p>\n<p><b>To: </b> Omi-Omi<br>\n&gt;&gt; Could probably meet up if it\u2019s at mine tho</p>\n<p>He\u2019s not <em> that </em> responsible. Plus, he <em> highly </em> doubts that Sakusa will take him up on the offer anyway. He\u2019s getting ready to put his phone in his bag when it buzzes again, faster than Atsumu expected.</p>\n<p><b>From: </b> Omi-Omi<br>\n&gt;&gt; Fine. I\u2019ll pick something without a lot of set up.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Atsumu\u2019s brows rise sharply, and then he blushes. He realizes too late that Osamu\u2019s eyes are narrowed at him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat's with that face?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNothin\u2019.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t look like nothin\u2019.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s none\u2019a yer business.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYa get turned down? Ya never hesitate ta tell me, everyone, strangers on the street, if ya landed a date.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, shaddup,\u201d Atsumu says, failing to come up with a decent retort as he shoves his phone in his bag.</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Tsumu, \u2018m sure there\u2019s someone out there who can put up with ya,\u201d Osamu continues, deadpan. \u201cWell\u2026 probably.\u201d</p>\n<p>Atsumu fights the urge to flip him off in public. He hikes his bag up on his shoulder and tries to hold his head high.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll have you know I didn\u2019t get turned down.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSure,\u201d Osamu says, deeply patronizing.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOh fuck you, Samu!\u201d Atsumu barks and then stomps out of the yoga studio.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kiyoomi pulls into the guest space in the parking garage of Atsumu\u2019s apartment building at 7:55 pm. He pauses in his car a moment, carefully folding and putting his driving gloves away in the center console. He takes a deep breath. He made his bed when he agreed to come here. No use regretting it yet.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He\u2019s sure there will be time for that later.</p>\n<p>The building is modern and well kept, Kiyoomi observes as he takes the elevator up to the seventh floor. It\u2019s newer construction, located within walking distance of the facility that the Black Jackals use for practice. It\u2019s undeniably convenient in location. Kiyoomi had forgone convenience for a larger apartment in a quieter part of town himself.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The elevator dings and he readjusts his grip on the small duffle bag that he brought with him. He quickly finds the door with the unit number Atsumu gave him and raps on it lightly.\u00a0</p>\n<p>It\u2019s only a few seconds before it swings open to reveal Atsumu, wearing just a pair of low-slung sweats. A towel hangs around his neck.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHeya, Omi-kun,\u201d he says, stepping back to invite Kiyoomi inside. \u201cSorry for the damp hair. I wanted ta shower earlier so I could wipe it down for ya. I assume you\u2019ll wanna take one?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, thank you. I also brought some disinfectant wipes,\u201d Kiyoomi can\u2019t help but add. His lack of trust in Atsumu\u2019s cleaning ability apparently doesn\u2019t go unnoticed as the other man rolls his eyes.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The genkan leads directly into a small hallway, which appears to hold the door to the bathroom and a closet. Beyond that is a single good-sized room. One corner contains a small kitchen, and another has a sofa and wall mounted TV. On the far side of the room, by the big windows, is a bed half hidden behind a partition.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kiyoomi\u2019s brow furrows. It\u2019s\u2026 really clean.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou want some tea or anything?\u201d Atsumu asks, padding towards the kitchenette.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s ok,\u201d Kiyoomi shakes his head. \u201cI\u2019ll just go get ready.\u201d</p>\n<p>He excuses himself to the bathroom and then looks around like he\u2019s in danger the second he closes the door, ready to pull the roll of disinfectant wipes he packed out of his bag. Kiyoomi\u2019s eyes narrow as he realizes the bathroom is just as clean as the main room appeared at first glance. It\u2019s not quite on par with Kiyoomi\u2019s usual spotlessness, but he doesn\u2019t even feel the need to pull out the wipes for the meticulous shower he takes.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Atsumu is sipping on a sports drink and scrolling through his phone when Kiyoomi leaves the bathroom, dressed in his usual.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDid you... pay a cleaning service to come today?\u201d</p>\n<p>Atsumu freezes mid-sip and gives Kiyoomi a look that makes him feel\u2026 stupid. Kiyoomi stands up a little straighter, preemptively defensive.</p>\n<p>\u201cUh, no. I don\u2019t have a maid, rich boy,\u201d Atsumu says. \u201cM\u2019perfectly capable of cleaning my own place. It\u2019s not like v-league players are rollin\u2019 in it. Not that you\u2019d know much about that, eh, Omi-kun?\u201d</p>\n<p>Kiyoomi rolls his eyes and ignores all the pot shots at his affluent upbringing. He\u2019s just having a difficult time believing that twenty-two year old athlete Miya Atsumu dusts the top of his bathroom mirror. Kiyoomi checked, just out of curiosity.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI just didn\u2019t expect\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFor me not t\u2019be a slob like Hinata an\u2019 Bokuto?\u201d Atsumu laughs. \u201cNaw, my da\u2019 fucked off when \u2018Samu and I were still in diapers so my ma\u2019 worked a lot. We did a lot of the cookin\u2019 and cleanin\u2019 once we got old enough not ta light the kitchen on fire.\u201d</p>\n<p>He\u2019s leaning against the counter with a fond smirk on his face.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d Kiyoomi says, not sure how to process the new information or what he\u2019s supposed to say in response.\u00a0</p>\n<p>For once, Atsumu seems to let him off the hook. Or maybe he\u2019s just eager.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAnyway, whatcha got for me today, Omi-kun?\u201d</p>\n<p>Kiyoomi mentally shakes himself. They\u2019re here so he can have the upper hand. It\u2019s time to take it back.</p>\n<p>\u201cI thought we could finally find out if you can get off from having your nipples played with.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Atsumu flushes a deep red, and satisfaction begins to pool in Kiyoomi\u2019s gut.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Atsumu may have miscalculated when he thought this wouldn\u2019t be anything <em> that </em>new or more intense than what they\u2019ve done before.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cBreathe, Atsumu,\u201d Sakusa says directly into his ear.\u00a0</p>\n<p>They\u2019re both sitting on the bed this time, Sakusa against the headboard with Atsumu against his chest. Atsumu\u2019s arms are tied behind his back. He can\u2019t see Sakusa, but he can feel his gaze tracking unimpeded up and down his body, can hear his voice, right <em> there </em>. Atsumu can feel the heat from his skin, against his shoulders, through the fabric of Sakusa\u2019s slacks.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Atsumu is painfully hard, dick worked mercilessly to the edge three or four times by clever, lubed-up fingers until he was <em> properly squirming, </em> according to Sakusa. At that point, Sakusa stopped touching his dick entirely, leaving it sad and weeping onto his belly while his hands moved north and stayed there, playing until Atsumu was completely lost to the touch on his chest and the voice in his ears.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cBreathe all the way into the bottom of your lungs and let it out slowly,\u201d Sakusa says. Atsumu does his best to comply.</p>\n<p>His breath stutters out into a long moan. It hitches and breaks when Sakusa pinches his nipples between his forefingers. They\u2019re puffy and sensitive, and at this point even the lightest of touches from Sakusa\u2019s fingers sends Atsumu twitching.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAgain,\u201d Sakusa says. Atsumu draws another gasping breath, all the way down against his diaphragm like Sakusa instructed.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Sakusa switches back to gently plucking the flushed nubs at a rapid pace. Atsumu\u2019s head lolls back against Sakusa\u2019s shoulder as he rolls his own towards his curving spine.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cShit, <em> Omi</em>, I can\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>Atsumu feels the mask brush against the shell of his ear, triggering a full body shudder.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cMaybe not. Just stay the word and I\u2019ll stop,\u201d Sakusa says in a teasing voice. \u201cBut this is the only way you\u2019re getting off tonight, so take it or leave it...\u201d</p>\n<p>A hysterical voice in the back of Atsumu\u2019s head tries to point out that he could just jerk off when Sakusa goes home, but the larger, fucked-up part of his brain immediately shuts it down. Ignoring Sakusa feels like a pathetic option, like it wouldn\u2019t even feel good to come that way.\u00a0</p>\n<p><em> \u201cOmi\u2026\u201d </em> Atsumu groans as Sakusa switches back to using his thumbs to draw tight rings around his nipples.\u00a0</p>\n<p>His legs push out against the duvet, sliding against the inside of Sakusa\u2019s. He\u2019s stuck here, so turned on but unable to do anything about it, untouched where he wants it most. The hands on his chest are sending hot little shocks of pleasure though his body to gather in the cradle of his hips. His neglected dick now sticks up desperately, drooling precome onto his stomach.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cFlex your hips,\u201d Sakusa instructs, encouraging the little twitches to turn into fuller movement. \u201cThere you go. Don\u2019t hold back, Atsumu\u2026 you can come whenever you want\u2026 do what feels good\u2026\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>It\u2019s torture. What would feel good is a hand on his <em> dick </em> but he knows that won\u2019t happen. A whine rips out of Atsumu\u2019s throat as Sakusa starts plucking at his nipples again, quick and soft. He\u2019s breathing too fast, too shallow, but he can\u2019t help it\u2014</p>\n<p>\n<em> \u201cHah\u2026 hah\u2026 hah\u2026 Omi\u2026\u201d </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u201cBreathe. Try to relax, Atsumu. If you want it, you\u2019re going to need to let it happen,\u201d Sakusa murmurs while kneading Atsumu\u2019s chest. \u201cLook at yourself. Look how turned on you are. Don\u2019t you look close?\u201d</p>\n<p>Atsumu forces his eyes open and looks down, sees black gloves spread out over pale skin that\u2019s painted with a bright flush and covered in sweat. He\u2019s slick with it at this point, his entire body overheated and oversensitive. His quads and abdominals bunch and tense as he gives into the urge to roll his hips up, seeking nonexistent friction.</p>\n<p>\u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d Atsumu whines, watching his cock bob uselessly.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Sakusa hushes him and pinches his nipples again, making Atsumu jolt and moan, before soothing them with gentle rubbing, back and forth, and back and forth\u2026</p>\n<p>\u201cI think you can, Atsumu. You\u2019re dripping,\u201d Sakusa says. \u201cYou just have to stop fighting and let yourself feel it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Atsumu squeezes his eyes shut again, letting out little broken noises as he surrenders to the pleasure Sakusa is drawing out of him. It\u2019s not where he wants it right now, but it feels <em> good </em>. He can\u2019t believe he\u2019s gone his whole life without this, ignoring an entire part of his body that clearly wants to be touched.\u00a0</p>\n<p>His hips start moving more fully, humping upwards with harsh clenches of his abs.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s it\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>He breathes deep, tries to flood his blood with oxygen like Sakusa instructed, the sensations in his chest becoming that much more intense every time he fills his lungs. Atsumu presses his chest up into Sakusa\u2019s hands, riding the waves of his shifting ministrations. Sakusa isn\u2019t pinching anymore and Atsumu\u2019s grateful for it, certain that pain would be a distraction at this point. Instead, he\u2019s cycling through different light touches that all leave Atsumu gasping. It feels good\u2014it feels so <em> good\u2014 </em></p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, keep moving your hips, just like that, Atsumu,\u201d Sakusa says, right into his ear again. Atsumu can feel his breath through the mask and it\u2019s making goosebumps break out on his skin. \u201cRoll them like you\u2019re fucking.\u201d</p>\n<p>The words hit like a slap across the face and, like the masochist Atsumu\u2019s quickly discovering he is, he moans wildly. He thrusts his hips up, clenching his stomach and his glutes at the apex of each movement. It\u2019s what his body wants to do naturally, but now all he can think about is how it imitates grinding his cock into a hot, tight hole.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The rapid flashes of pleasure originating from his chest are starting to sink lower, down into the base of his cock, and <em> oh god he might actually be able to come from this. </em></p>\n<p>Sakusa\u2019s thumbs continue to rub quick, barely-there circles around his nipples, and suddenly Atsumu is painfully aware of all the places the two of them are touching. He and Sakusa are pretty much the same size, all things considered, but he still feels surrounded. A whine leaks out of his throat as Sakusa increases the pressure slightly.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou like women, right, Atsumu?\u201d Sakusa asks, line of thought untrackable from Atsumu\u2019s point of view. \u201cDo you play with their tits like this? Make them feel like this?\u201d</p>\n<p>Heat so sharp it\u2019s nearly painful stabs through Atsumu\u2019s gut and he moans in surprise, blushing furiously. Sakusa rubs two slick fingers from each hand over Atsumu\u2019s swollen nipples, drawing rhythmic shapes.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you touch their clits like this? Do you get them off, Atsumu? Do you make them come just like this?\u201d</p>\n<p><em> \u201cFuck\u2026!\u201d </em> Atsumu cries out, profanity turning to whimpers as the slow but steady pace of his hips increases.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s overloaded by Sakusa\u2019s touch, by the images he\u2019s painting in Atsumu\u2019s head. There\u2019s a pressure against Atsumu\u2019s lower back that tells him Sakusa\u2019s just as hard as he is. It\u2019s happened in other scenes, but this is the first time Atsumu\u2019s been sitting in Sakusa\u2019s lap for it, the first time he\u2019s <em> felt </em>it. He bites his lip and groans, wondering if the clumsy movements of his hips are making Sakusa feel good, too.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The heat builds and builds, concentrating between his legs. Just one stroke of his cock would do it, Atsumu <em> swears.\u00a0 </em></p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s it, Atsumu. You\u2019re close. I can tell. Show me,\u201d Sakusa says, and if Atsumu was less of a mess he might notice how strained the other man\u2019s voice sounds.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s not enough. It\u2019s not enough, Atsumu thinks, until it suddenly <em> is </em>. It builds slower than usual, climbing with each continued thrust of his hips up into nothing. Sakusa is softly pinching, quick little grasps and releases, as Atsumu\u2019s chest inflates, breath held at the apex.</p>\n<p>Atsumu teeters there for what feels like a long time, and then his body curls sharply, like a rope snapping.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em> \u201cUhn\u2014\u201d </em>\n</p>\n<p>A sound gets stuck in his throat, and then Atsumu\u2019s cock kicks. Come splatters over his stomach, splashes over his chest.\u00a0</p>\n<p><em> \u201cUuuuuuuuuhhhnnngg,\u201d </em> Atsumu moans as his hips continue to jerk and Sakusa keeps stroking his nipples, pressing down now, almost soothing.\u00a0</p>\n<p>There\u2019s harsh breath against the bolt of Atsumu\u2019s jaw.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, <em> yes, </em> there you go. I knew you could do it.\u201d</p>\n<p>As far as orgasms go, it\u2019s not the best Atsumu\u2019s ever had, almost ruined by the lack of stimulation as he spills all over himself. However, the deep sense of pleasure and pride that radiates through him more than makes up for it.<em> He did it.\u00a0 </em></p>\n<p>He lets his head drop back fully against Sakusa\u2019s shoulder and just breathes, chest heaving. Sakusa finally moves his hands from Atsumu\u2019s chest, drawing them smoothly down his sides. He moves them up and down, a calming pressure.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cGood, Atsumu. <em> Good. </em>That was amazing. You did so well\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>Atsumu lets his eyes slip shut and basks in the praise.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>And so, Atsumu\u2019s life settles into a new routine. He plays volleyball. He sees his family as much as possible. He dutifully taste tests each new flavor put on the menu at Onigiri Miya. He travels, he plays more volleyball, and about once a week he meets up with Sakusa Kiyoomi and lets his teammate ruin him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>So it goes.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The drink tray clatters dangerously to the table in chorus with Meian\u2019s booming laugh. Their captain plops himself down at the table where he\u2019s been holding court with Inunaki, Hinata, Bokuto, Sakusa, and Atsumu. Barnes, Adriah, and the rest have set up shop at the bar. They\u2019re coming off a five match winning streak, including another victory against the Adlers last week. Meian demanded celebration in the name of team bonding and none of them had any objections, least of all Atsumu.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you trying to get the kids drunk, Cap?\u201d Inunaki teases as he pulls a bright yellow drink off the tray.\u00a0</p>\n<p><em> It\u2019s a bit late for that</em>, Atsumu thinks, reaching for his own beverage as his head sloshes. He leans back against the wall of the booth once he has his drink securely in hand.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWho ya callin\u2019 kids? Yer not that much older than us.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah! You\u2019re only three years older than me!\u201d Bokuto yells, beer threatening to spill out of his glass as he gestures wildly.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cTwo,\u201d Sakusa corrects, making Bokuto gasp and hold up two fingers.</p>\n<p>\u201cTwo?!\u201d</p>\n<p>Sakusa has been sipping on something clear and sparkling throughout the evening; he looks pretty put together from an outsider\u2019s point of view, but Atsumu can track the little red flush highlighting the shells of his ears and the tip of his nose. The biggest give away is his mask\u2014no longer on his face, but set on the actual tabletop. Atsumu snickers.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe only real baby here is Shouyou-kun,\u201d Atsumu says, vigorously ruffling a head of bright orange hair with his free hand.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHey! I lived overseas! I\u2019ve been to the other side of the world! What have <em> you </em>done?\u201d Hinata says, cheeks a pair of bright red apples, eyes sparkling with mischief.</p>\n<p>Atsumu gapes in mock offense. \u201cI can\u2019t believe my <em> only son </em> is talkin\u2019 to me like this.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s not your son, you freak,\u201d Sakusa says with narrowed eyes.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI birthed him, from my own V-League sets,\u201d Atsumu counters.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cEw.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cStop sayin\u2019 ew at me, Omi, that\u2019s <em> rude</em>,\u201d Atsumu barks, leaning his elbow on the table.\u00a0</p>\n<p><em> \u201cEw,\u201d </em> Sakusa emphasizes, with defiant, narrowed eyes.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cEnough, children!\u201d Meian interrupts before Atsumu can find something to throw at Sakusa. \u201cWe\u2019re here for team bonding, not team <em> bitching </em>. We\u2019re supposed to be learning more about each other!\u201d</p>\n<p>Atsumu is starting to think that their captain is no better at holding his liquor than the rest of them, but he happily ponders the request. After a second, he claps his hands together.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI got it!\u201d Atsumu says. \u201cWho was everyone\u2019s first serious crush?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Meian\u2019s eyes light up and Inunaki groans good-naturedly as the captain turns his eyes to the libero.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, Inunaki, you start!\u201d Meian demands, no room for dissent.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Inunaki hums and takes another sip of his drink.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAh! Hasegawa Ichika! I was head over <em> heels </em> for her in my first year of high school. She was the captain and ace of the girls\u2019 volleyball club. I swear, half my schoolboy fantasies were about receiving her spikes\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>Atsumu cackles while Bokuto looks on with enraptured eyes.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019d assume that was a dirty metaphor if liberos weren\u2019t so damn weird,\u201d Meian laughs and Inunaki heaves a wistful sigh. \u201cOk, next! Kiyoomi-kun!\u201d</p>\n<p>Sakusa looks like he\u2019s sucking on a lemon where he\u2019s sitting next to Inunaki, but Atsumu speaks up before he can even open his mouth.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s easy\u2014Ushiwaka. <em> Next!\u201d </em></p>\n<p>Meian, on Atsumu\u2019s right at the head of their table, brings a large hand down on Atsumu\u2019s head, squishing it towards the tabletop.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not your turn, brat. Hush!\u201d</p>\n<p>Sakusa leans back and folds his arms over his chest.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, the brat is correct, unfortunately. I developed an infatuation with Wakatoshi-kun in my first year of high school. Admiration and affection get mixed up easily at that age, and I was obsessed with his volleyball,\u201d Sakusa says.</p>\n<p>The rest of the professional athletes around the table nod sagely in understanding.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI totally get that,\u201d Hinata says. \u201cIf I met him before he graduated, I bet I would have had a crush on Karasuno\u2019s original Tiny Giant. I can totally see how you could have that for Ushijima-san.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cPlus\u2026 have ya seen his arms?\u201d Atsumu muses, and Sakusa levels him with a disparaging glance that only earns him a wink in return.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cQuit drooling, Atsumu-kun,\u201d Inunaki teases.</p>\n<p>\u201cLook, I gotta give credit where credit\u2019s due,\u201d Atsumu says with a sleazy grin and then turns to Bokuto, who\u2019s next in their rotation, sitting between Sakusa and Hinata. \u201cBokkun! Yer next!\u201d</p>\n<p>A huge dopey grin blooms on Bokuto\u2019s face as a bright, happy flush spreads across his cheeks. Atsumu grimaces, realizing his mistake too late.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, my first big crush was on Akaashi! When he\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>Atsumu interrupts immediately by making loud barfing sounds.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYuck, <em> god</em>, we get it. You and Akaashi are adorable perfect soulmates. Quit shovin\u2019 it in our faces,\u201d he says, and Meian doesn\u2019t even tell him to shut up this time because he\u2019s <em> right </em>. If Bokuto gets started they\u2019ll spend the next hour with him detailing the exact shade of Akaashi\u2019s eyes in the early spring. Luckily, Bokuto has already started texting his boyfriend so he doesn\u2019t seem to care too much about being shut down. \u201cShouyou-kun, next. Bet I can guess this\u2019un, too.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Hinata sits up straight in his seat, face serious.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cGo on then, Hinata,\u201d Inunaki encourages.</p>\n<p>The compact spiker nods, head held high.</p>\n<p>\u201cShimizu-senpai.\u201d</p>\n<p>Atsumu blinks, taking a second to think through the alcohol induced fog in his brain. Then he finally places the name. \u201c...Yer manager?\u201d</p>\n<p>Holding his drink between two hands, Hinata nods resolutely, eyes far away. The rest of the table looks as confused as Atsumu feels.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cShouyou-kun, aren\u2019t you <em> with </em> Kageyama Tobio? You went to high school together, right?\u201d Inunaki asks.</p>\n<p>Hinata cocks his head to the side in confusion, \u201cYeah, all three years.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bokuto brings his fist down into his palm in an <em> ah-hah </em> gesture, \u201cSo you didn\u2019t get together until after high school?\u201d</p>\n<p>Atsumu splutters, completely baffled. \u201cNo! No, I know for a <em> fact </em> that they kissed <em> on the court </em> at the Summer Interhigh after they kicked Omi\u2019s team\u2019s ass in our third year. I was watchin\u2019 that quarter-finals match.\u201d Hinata had jumped into the air, grabbed Kageyama\u2019s face in both hands and planted one right on him after their set point won the match. You don\u2019t forget something like that. He turns to Sakusa. \u201cTell \u2018em, Omi-kun.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sakusa narrows his eyes, \u201cWell, the game went to full sets so I wouldn\u2019t say they <em> kicked our ass </em>\u2026 but Hinata and Kageyama did kiss.\u201d</p>\n<p>Everyone looks back at Hinata, baffled, who\u2019s staring at them with an equally confused gaze.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo, you did have a crush on him in high school?\u201d Meian asks.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Hinata\u2019s eyes go wide and then he shakes his head back and forth resolutely, \u201cA crush?! On Kageyama? Gross! No way.\u201d</p>\n<p>He looks repulsed by the notion.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Everyone around the table blinks. Atsumu downs the rest of his drink.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cGross? Last week when we played the Adlers you told Kageyama you\u2019d get married when you could make the rings out of a gold medal,\u201d Sakusa points out, and Bokuto nods vigorously.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat was a dumb thing to say in the heat of the moment. I\u2019d never deface an olympic gold like that,\u201d Hinata says, nonplused. \u201cAnyway, what\u2019s your point?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAlright! That\u2019s enough study on the matin\u2019 habits of crow demons, <em> next,\u201d </em> Atsumu nearly shouts, needing this bewildering conversation to end.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019d be you, Atsumu,\u201d Meian points out, and oh, huh, he\u2019s right.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Atsumu takes a deep breath; he definitely knows the answer to this one.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cMy first crush that lasted more than a couple weeks was definitely my second year captain, Kita Shinsuke,\u201d he says without much shame, though he definitely wouldn\u2019t want to admit it to Kita himself and make him uncomfortable.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Though, knowing Kita, he\u2019d probably just smile and say he was flattered.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYour captain?\u201d Meian says, a humorous glint in his eye. \u201cShould I be concerned that you\u2019re going to fall for me, Atsumu-kun?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIf yer lucky, <em> Shugo-kun</em>,\u201d Atsumu jokingly flirts back, but then he laughs and runs his hand through his hair. \u201cNo, Kita-san was just\u2026 he was a serious guy\u2026 all stoic, ya know? He was so good at keepin\u2019 us in line. He didn\u2019t laugh much, so it made you wanna, like\u2014it jus\u2019 meant when you <em> could </em>get him to laugh, it was\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>It\u2019s as the words are coming out of his mouth that Atsumu registers something horrific. The sentence freezes in his throat as he makes eye contact with Sakusa\u2014as he takes in Sakusa\u2019s stoic, serious face.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cTsum-Tsum?\u201d Bokuto prompts.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?!\u201d Atsumu yelps, too high-pitched. \u201cI wasn\u2019t\u2014it\u2019s nothing! Sorry, bathroom.\u201d</p>\n<p>He nearly knocks his glass onto the floor in his haste to stand up, cursing and wobbling as he fumbles for it.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Sakusa laughs. So does the rest of the table, but Atsumu barely hears them.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em> No. No, thank you.\u00a0 </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u201cStop it!\u201d Atsumu points his finger right at Sakusa, trying to sound deadly serious.\u00a0</p>\n<p>That just makes Sakusa smirk and chuckle more.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Atsumu flees to the restroom to have a mild existential crisis in peace.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDo I go after folks who play hard to get?\u201d</p>\n<p>Atsumu is sitting at the countertop of Onigiri Miya. There\u2019s a bottle of sake and two cups on the raised ledge between the front of the restaurant and the kitchen. Osamu is wiping down the counter behind the bar. All the chairs are put up on tables for the night\u2014except Atsumu\u2019s, of course.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Osamu looks up from his wet rag and looks at Atsumu with wide eyes under a furrowed brow.</p>\n<p>\u201cUh. Yeah,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s like\u2026 yer <em> whole </em> thing, \u2018Tsumu. I thought you knew this.\u201d</p>\n<p>Atsumu sputters.</p>\n<p>\u201cKnew it?! How could I know it?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBecause you\u2019ve been doing it since elementary school?\u201d Osamu says, still looking baffled. \u201cYanagi Ryoko kicked ya in the knee in first grade, called ya stupid, and you made Ma put a picture ya drew of her in crayon on the fridge.\u201d</p>\n<p>Atsumu huffs, \u201cI had a crush, so what? She was cute.\u201d</p>\n<p>Osamu crosses his arms over his chest.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll give ya credit considering it sometimes works out by some ridiculous chance, but yer like that for everything,\u201d Osamu says, in his <em> yer-so-stupid </em> voice. \u201cI mean what kinda person points at a random first year middle blocker from another prefecture, after playing one game against \u2018em, and claims yer gonna set for them one day? Who fuckin\u2019 does that?\u201d</p>\n<p>Atsumu\u2019s face burns and he saves himself by having to answer to that by taking a huge bite of an extra large onigiri.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAnyway, why d\u2019ya ask?\u201d Osamu asks, leaning an elbow on the counter and draining his most recent glass of sake. \u201cIs this about whoever rejected you the other day?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI didn\u2019t get rejected!\u201d Atsumu says, and a few grains of rice fly from his mouth to the table.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Osamu glares at him, \u201cYou\u2019re cleaning that counter when you\u2019re done.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Atsumu ignores him. So what, he has a type. Just because Sakusa fits it doesn\u2019t have to mean anything. In defiance, he pulls out his phone and flips open his messages.\u00a0</p>\n<p><b>To: </b> Omi-Omi<br>\n&gt;&gt; You free tomorrow? After practice?\u00a0</p>\n<p>It\u2019s a while before Atsumu gets a response. He finishes his food; together they finish the sake, and Atsumu helps Osamu do the final close out for the restaurant. His phone buzzes as they step out into the cold October evening. They aren\u2019t drunk, but there\u2019s a pleasant buzz under Atsumu\u2019s skin and the chill doesn\u2019t bother him. Their breaths puff out in misty clouds as Atsumu pulls the device out his pocket.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou want to crash on my couch? It\u2019s closer than yers, and I got the new Smash,\u201d Osamu says.\u00a0</p>\n<p>It\u2019s still pretty weird that they don\u2019t live together, Atsumu thinks, even a few years down the road. They lived out of each other's pockets for so long, since before they started forming memories. Atsumu believes that one day he might be sixty and still find it strange that he doesn\u2019t have to pound on the bathroom door in the morning and yell at Osamu to hurry the fuck up\u2014boxes of cheap bleach and toner under the sink.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Atsumu looks down at his phone screen.\u00a0</p>\n<p><b>From: </b> Omi-Omi<br>\n&gt;&gt; Yes. You can come straight over. There\u2019s something I\u2019ve been wanting to do that you haven\u2019t tried yet.\u00a0</p>\n<p>A zip of electricity runs up Atsumu\u2019s spine and he can\u2019t help but smile. He looks up at the tops of the buildings around them, tries to pick out stars through the light pollution.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cFor sure, \u2018Samu. Thanks,\u201d he says. \u201cHope yer ready to get your ass kicked.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou wish,\u201d Osamu replies, hands stuffed in their pockets as they walk towards the train station.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kiyoomi tells Atsumu he should wait on the couch after his shower.</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t see what the point of all the secrecy is when ya already told me what we\u2019re doin' today, Omi-kun.\u201d</p>\n<p>They toe off their shoes and line them up against the wall. Kiyoomi puts his keys on their hook on the coat rack.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThere are a lot of variations to temperature play, but one of the best parts is the way it surprises you and keeps you on edge,\u201d Kiyoomi explains, pulling off his scarf. \u201cThat\u2019s why you\u2019ll be blindfolded and gagged.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p>\n<p>When Kiyoomi glances over his shoulder, Atsumu has his back to him, but he spots the red tips of his ears. Kiyoomi can\u2019t help but smirk a little.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll just, uh, hop in the shower,\u201d Atsumu says quickly.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou do that,\u201d Kiyoomi says with humor.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He uses the time that Atsumu is in the shower. This is definitely one of the more set up intensive kinks, but Kiyoomi finds it worth the time. First he piles the pillows in the corner of the room and pulls a bedside table to the bottom of the bed. Then he goes to the closet. Initially, he pulls out a plastic painting sheet and lays it over the whole bed. Then he grabs a similarly disposable drop cloth to lay over it.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The idea of laying on plastic has always sounded incredibly uncomfortable and distracting to Kiyoomi.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Some of what they\u2019re doing today Kiyoomi has done before, but there are a few new things he\u2019s been wanting to try after reading about them on the online dominant group. The small pitcher candle of soy wax that Kiyoomi pulls out of the closet next is a product he\u2019s used before and enjoys. Though he\u2019s glad that Atsumu will be blindfolded and won\u2019t have the opportunity to say anything about the wax being black.\u00a0</p>\n<p>What can he say? He likes the clean contrast; he has white wax stocked as well for that very reason.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He pulls out his new purchases next: a hot water bath, a thick ceramic pot about the same size, and two sets of glass plugs. One set is long and tapered; the other is shorter but much thicker. Each set contains a small, medium, and large plug. Kiyoomi removed them from the packaging and cleaned them this morning, but he still gives them a quick spray with a gentle disinfectant and wipes them down again before setting them down on the bed.</p>\n<p>Kiyoomi takes the ceramic pot and the water bath to the kitchen, filling the latter with water and the former with ice before topping it up with some water as well. He takes both containers back to the bedroom, sets them on the side table, and plugs the water bath in. He sets the temperature to 42\u00b0C and places the wider plugs into the rapidly heating water. He takes the longer plugs and slips them into the icy water. He also places a pump-top bottle of lube in each container.\u00a0</p>\n<p>With all of that done, he heads into the bathroom to shower. Once clean and dressed, Kiyoomi heads back to the closet to grab the last pieces of equipment he needs: a leather eye mask, a ball gag, a clicker... and two brand new, padded, fur-lined wrist cuffs.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Who would have thought Miya Atsumu would end up being an easy bruiser?</p>\n<p>Kiyoomi only wishes their careers didn\u2019t involve constantly wearing short uniforms; he\u2019d take more advantage of it otherwise.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He heads out into the living room, unsurprised to find Atsumu already sitting on the couch in just his towel. His back is to the bedroom hallway and Kiyoomi pauses, just for a moment, then clears his throat. Atsumu tilts his head over the back of the couch to watch Kiyoomi approach. Upside down, a flush spreads over his cheeks as he clocks the items in Kiyoomi\u2019s hands.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, right. Yep. Starting out here, so I, uh, can\u2019t see,\u201d Atsumu says.</p>\n<p>Kiyoomi walks around the couch, smirking behind the mask as he comes to a stop in front of Atsumu, the other man looking up at him with dilated eyes. First he holds up the cuffs.</p>\n<p>\u201cI know we avoided cuffs for a while, but I ordered these, which should be pretty unlikely to leave marks,\u201d Kiyoomi says, showing him the new restraints.</p>\n<p>They\u2019re leather on the outside, but they do have a thicker than usual layer of foam padding on the inside, covered by a silky fur lining. Tightened properly, they shouldn\u2019t be able to pinch at all and should prevent Atsumu from causing himself any visible damage, no matter how hard he pulls.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cC-cool, yeah,\u201d Atsumu says, eyes more focused on the gag and blindfold.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Still, Kiyoomi starts with the cuffs, carefully buckling one around each wrist and then clipping them together with a short, 3-point connector. Then he grabs the clicker from his pocket. It\u2019s about two inches long, made of black plastic, and has a button set into a divot in the middle.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d Atsumu asks, eyeing it suspiciously.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cA dog training clicker,\u201d Kiyoomi says, showing it to Atsumu and then clicking it a few times to demonstrate the clear, metallic popping noise. \u201cSince you\u2019re gagged, we won\u2019t be able to use our usual color system. This clicker is your safeword. You\u2019ll hold it in one hand, and if you click it I\u2019ll immediately stop and remove the gag so you can speak. If I notice you\u2019ve dropped it, I\u2019ll do the same. Understand, Atsumu?\u201d</p>\n<p>He presses the clicker into Atsumu\u2019s palm.</p>\n<p>\u201cGot it,\u201d Atsumu says, clicking it to test it out. \u201cYer not gonna burn me, right?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course not. I\u2019m a little concerned you didn\u2019t ask that question earlier.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t judge me!\u201d</p>\n<p>Ok, gag time. Kiyoomi grabs it and tilts Atsumu\u2019s head back.</p>\n<p>\u201cAny last words?\u201d he asks, purposefully ominous. Atsumu snorts and shakes his head. \u201cAlright, open your mouth.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Atsumu does as he\u2019s told, holding Kiyoomi\u2019s eyes as the black rubber ball slides between his teeth. Kiyoomi mildly regrets not putting the blindfold on first as he watches Atsumu\u2019s eyes mist over in real time when Kiyoomi latches the buckle behind his head.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He brushes a finger over Atsumu\u2019s cheek, caught in his own daze for just a second, before picking up the blindfold and slotting it into place. Atsumu\u2019s breath speeds up a little.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIs that okay, Atsumu? Comfortable?\u201d Atsumu nods, chin slipping from Kiyoomi\u2019s hand. \u201cGood. Follow me now, I\u2019ll help guide you.\u201d</p>\n<p>He helps Atsumu stand, towel sliding off, and then leads the way with a few fingers hooked into the leather connector of the cuffs. He walks them down the hall and into the bedroom, positions Atsumu at the foot of the bed, then unceremoniously pushes him down. Atsumu\u2019s back bounces against the canvas drop sheet and he grunts quietly behind the gag.</p>\n<p>Kiyoomi lets himself look for a minute at Atsumu, blind and silenced, cuffed hands tucked demurely against his chest. His eyes can\u2019t help but linger on Atsumu\u2019s lips, stretched lewdly around the black rubber ball, and his cock, already half-hard in anticipation.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cScoot higher on the bed,\u201d Kiyoomi instructs, helping him wiggle up until he can clip the remaining connector to a crossbar of the headboard.\u00a0</p>\n<p>With that done, he moves the side table until it\u2019s easily within arms reach, then spreads Atsumu\u2019s legs, making a space for himself between them. He rests his palms on the top of Atsumu\u2019s thighs. Normally he\u2019d ask if Atsumu is ready at this point, but he won\u2019t be able to answer now. It makes Sakusa\u2019s breath shudder excitedly on the exhale.</p>\n<p>He checks one more time that the clicker is secure in Atsumu\u2019s hand, and then he begins.</p>\n<p>Kiyoomi starts by simply dipping his gloved fingers into the ice bath and holding them over Atsumu\u2019s chest, letting the frigid droplets splatter onto his skin. Atsumu twitches, head kicking back a little. Kiyoomi does it again, twice more, until there are little rivulets of water running down Atsumu\u2019s skin, a small pool collecting in his belly button. When he finally touches Atsumu directly, he uses even strokes of both hands to spread the water out, making goosebumps break out on Atsumu\u2019s skin as the droplets begin to evaporate.</p>\n<p>Kiyoomi makes one more pass with the cold water before quickly switching to the other water bath, splashing hot droplets down on Atsumu\u2019s torso.</p>\n<p>Atsumu jerks, the restraints clinking, and Kiyoomi smiles. It\u2019s all about the contrast, the unexpected. They\u2019re just getting started.</p>\n<p>Kiyoomi toys with him like that for a while, simply using the water and ice to his heart\u2019s content. Atsumu makes a stifled sound when Kiyoomi puts ice directly on his nipples, letting it melt and tease the little nubs until they\u2019re dark and stiff. Inspired, Kiyoomi grabs two of the glass plugs out of the hot water and presses their tips to the hard peaks on Atsumu\u2019s chest. He fights Kiyoomi for just a second and then collapses, a moan leaking out around the gag.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Satisfied that Atsumu is properly warmed up\u2014pun only mildly intended\u2014Kiyoomi slides the plugs back into the water bath and then pumps some of the warm lube onto his fingers. He pushes one of Atsumu\u2019s knees up before sliding two fingers down to circle his hole. Atsumu\u2019s stomach goes concave for a moment as he tenses and releases at the gentle touch, mouth working silently around the gag.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kiyoomi doesn\u2019t keep him waiting, sliding one long finger past the tight ring of muscle, then two on the next thrust in. He doesn\u2019t tease him much, nor does he give Atsumu more than two. Kiyoomi knows it\u2019s just the knowledge of what\u2019s about to come that makes him think Atsumu feels hotter than usual inside, but he still revels in it.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He removes his fingers and turns to the icy water, reaching in to find the smallest of the tapered plugs, which he pulls out and coats in the chilled lube. Kiyoomi pushes Atsumu\u2019s leg up farther with his clean hand and then pauses, basking in the thrum of excitement racing through him. Atsumu has absolutely no idea what\u2019s coming, breathing fast but steady as he waits for whatever Kiyoomi\u2019s going to give him.</p>\n<p>Fuck, Kiyoomi loves scenes with surprises.\u00a0</p>\n<p>With that he slides the cold glass plug inside in one smooth push. It\u2019s small and slick, so it slides right in with just a touch of gentle pressure even as Atsumu clenches down and spasms in shock. A muffled sound in his throat catches and bleeds out as he raises his knees, trying uselessly to escape the feeling. Kiyoomi forces them to stay open. The plug doesn\u2019t move; even as small as it is, Kiyoomi knows Atsumu is still <em> taking </em> a great deal of sensation as the cold from the glass seeps into his insides.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cKeep your knees apart, Atsumu,\u201d Kiyoomi murmurs, the first words between them in a while.</p>\n<p>The sound Atsumu makes at that is even louder than the one from the icy intrusion as he forces his legs to splay. It brings a smile to Kiyoomi\u2019s face as he pets the inside of Atsumu\u2019s thighs in encouragement. Atsumu loves being told what to do and he follows directions like a dream; the least Kiyoomi can do is reward him for being so good.</p>\n<p>He grabs another pump of the cold lube and wraps his hand around Atsumu\u2019s cock to give it a few solid strokes.</p>\n<p>Atsumu\u2019s hips jerk and buck, like he\u2019s unsure if he wants to get closer or further away from the sensation surrounding his dick. Too bad retreat only presses the plug further into him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>After a moment, Kiyoomi checks the temperature of the plug, pleased that the pyrex glass seems to be holding temperature well.\u00a0</p>\n<p>WIth that, Kiyoomi reaches into the warm water bath to retrieve the smallest wide plug and coats it in the heated lube. He pulls the small, tapered plug from Atsumu\u2019s quivering hole, causing his breath to freeze in his chest. Once again taking no quarter, Kiyoomi doesn\u2019t hesitate to press the thicker, hot plug into its place.</p>\n<p>A groan bursts around the ball gag as Atsumu\u2019s hips twist. The plug isn\u2019t very big, barely wider than three of Sakusa\u2019s fingers and only a few inches long, but you wouldn\u2019t know it from the dramatics of Atsumu\u2019s reaction.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDoes it feel good, Atsumu? You can feel every millimeter of it, can\u2019t you?\u201d Kiyoomi says as he presses down on the base, watching Atsumu arch for him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t wait for an answer that Atsumu can\u2019t give. Instead, he touches his weeping dick, a few light jerks at a time, dipping his hand in the hot or cold water at random. He teases Atsumu\u2019s nipples with ice again, letting it melt into rivulets, watching his whole body shudder.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kiyoomi fights off the passing thought of what might happen if a tongue was pressed to one of those stiff buds right now. He ignores the way his own mouth floods with saliva at the idea of closing his lips around them and <em> sucking</em>, drawing hot blood to the skin to meet his warm mouth.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He absolutely needs to interrupt that train of thought before it takes off. \u201cTurn over.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Atsumu takes a second but, with Kiyoomi\u2019s help, he eventually complies. Soon Atsumu is on his belly, round ass hugging the base of the plug. Kiyoomi stares greedily for a few seconds, squeezes one cheek and presses the warm plug down before pulling it out.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The medium chilled plug comes out next and Kiyoomi slides it in quickly, refusing to let Atsumu squirm much as the icy glass fills him up.\u00a0</p>\n<p><em> \u201cMhn! Mhhhhn!\u201d </em>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The noises are delicious. Atsumu cries out uselessly into the gag as Kiyoomi forces him to <em> feel </em>the chill no doubt leaching into him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kiyoomi kneads his ass for just a few minutes, spanking him once or twice and forcing him to clench around the cold intrusion whenever he starts to settle. Before long, though, Kiyoomi gets ready to switch plugs; he doesn\u2019t want to let the temperature start waning this time. He reaches for the next one and coats it in hot lube.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s ready with both hands this time, pulling the cold plug out and shoving the new, thicker one in without any delay. Atsumu has probably picked up on the pattern by now, but it doesn\u2019t stop him from nearly shouting through the gag. His spine bends as the plug stretches him, pushing heat deep to shock his chilled flesh.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Atsumu humps the bed for a while this time and Kiyoomi just watches, trailing fingers over his ass, up and down his thighs, spanking him oh-so-lightly every once in a while. His mouth waters again as he looks his fill and thinks about how far they\u2019ve come in such a short amount of time. How far <em> Atsumu </em>has come. A few months ago he was asking naively about the \u201csex stuff\u201d hanging in Kiyoomi\u2019s bathroom; now he\u2019s bound and gagged and blindfolded, rutting shamelessly against Kiyoomi\u2019s bed with a warm glass plug sitting thick inside him and his ass pink from spanking.</p>\n<p>Kiyoomi has broken him. And, he realizes with a sharp breath, he\u2019s nowhere near finished.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDid I say you could move?\u201d</p>\n<p>Atsumu freezes, glutes flexed as he breathes hard. He whines and trembles, hips jumping in little fits like he doesn\u2019t have any control over them.\u00a0</p>\n<p><em> He probably doesn\u2019t, </em>Kiyoomi thinks gleefully. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, Atsumu. I know you can\u2019t help it.\u201d</p>\n<p>He smacks one of Atsumu\u2019s pert cheeks and watches it jiggle. He twists the hot plug, pulls on it just enough that it starts to stretch him before letting it sink back in. Kiyoomi\u2019s cock aches at the noise Atsumu makes in response.</p>\n<p>He takes a deep breath and reaches for the ice water again, where the longest glass plug is waiting. It\u2019s had a lot of time to absorb the chill, and so has the lube that Kiyoomi smears on it. He can\u2019t even imagine how it\u2019s going to feel inside.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Atsumu must hear the slosh of the ice because he squirms again, shivering as he tugs on the cuffs and the headboard creaks. His thighs tense when Kiyoomi twists the plug again then pulls it all the way out this time, dropping it in the hot water bath and holding his breath.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Atsumu screams into the gag and his whole body jerks when Kiyoomi touches his hole with the tip of the slick, ice-cold plug.</p>\n<p>\u201cShh shh shh,\u201d Kiyoomi murmurs, pushing forward insistently despite Atsumu\u2019s best attempts to keep him out.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The furled muscle of his hole is clenched up tight, but it\u2019s no match for the slick glass and Kiyoomi\u2019s desire to see him ruined. He presses, presses, presses until the longest plug he owns is fully seated. His dick twitches against the seam of his slacks as Atsumu rocks forward in a desperate and useless attempt to get away from the sensation of icy glass deep inside.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Atsumu\u2019s head thrashes so violently that he almost dislodges his blindfold;\u00a0 garbled attempts at Kiyoomi\u2019s name pour from his stuffed mouth over and over. Through it all, he holds firmly onto the clicker and doesn\u2019t make a single move to press it.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kiyoomi lands a firm <em> smack </em>on his ass and laughs quietly when Atsumu\u2019s wail comes out jumbled around the gag, as does whatever he tries to say afterward.</p>\n<p>He can\u2019t resist teasing. \u201cI should\u2019ve gagged you a long time ago, huh?\u201d</p>\n<p>Atsumu moans and pushes his ass back before he returns to rutting against the bed. He\u2019s shivering from the inescapable cold, goosebumps breaking out along the long line of his back. Kiyoomi runs a gloved finger down the length of his spine, slow and deliberate, before patting his flank like he\u2019s a well-behaved animal; his slowly-building suspicion that Atsumu enjoys a little bit of degradation gets stronger when Atsumu pushes up onto his knees and rocks backward, seeking out Kiyoomi\u2019s demeaning touch once again.</p>\n<p>He decides to press it a little further.</p>\n<p>\u201cLook at you,\u201d he murmurs, wiggling the base of the cold plug. Atsumu screams into the gag and collapses back onto the mattress. \u201cSo desperate.\u201d</p>\n<p>Atsumu\u2019s hips stutter as he starts to hump the bed again, still shivering. Kiyoomi takes a deep breath in through his nose, more affected by this than he thought he would be. Atsumu is <em> squirming, </em>arching his back like an animal in heat, offering himself up unconditionally to Kiyoomi\u2019s capable hands.</p>\n<p>Kiyoomi swallows, throat clicking. <em> Shit. </em></p>\n<p>Fuck it, Atsumu can\u2019t see him; Kiyoomi reaches down and adjusts himself in his slacks. It\u2019s the first time he\u2019s touched himself in any capacity in Atsumu\u2019s presence, and it feels so good that Kiyoomi almost doesn\u2019t stop, dick twitching as his eyes rake over Atsumu\u2019s body and his thoughts run rampant. But he reigns himself in and lets go after he\u2019s shifted his dick so that it\u2019s not pressing against the seam of his zipper.</p>\n<p>His eyes dart to the hot water bath, where the largest, thickest plug is waiting.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Atsumu doesn\u2019t react at all this time when Kiyoomi reaches over to pull it out of the water and cover it in warm lubricant; he must be too caught up in his own head to hear Kiyoomi\u2019s movements, little noises catching behind the gag as he rocks against the mattress, pert cheeks flexing.</p>\n<p>He has no idea what\u2019s coming. Kiyoomi is so hard it hurts.</p>\n<p>When he grasps the base of the cold plug and tugs gently, Atsumu gasps and his legs jerk inward, trying to close; they would, if Kiyoomi weren\u2019t sitting on his heels in between them. Kiyoomi bites his lip at the contact as Atsumu\u2019s knees bracket his thighs.</p>\n<p>He lets go of the cold plug, delighting in Atsumu\u2019s gasp and it shifts snugly back into place, and brings his hand down <em> hard </em>on Atsumu\u2019s ass. Atsumu cries out sharply and his hole winks around the smooth glass.</p>\n<p>\u201cKeep.\u201d <em> Smack. </em> \u201cYour legs.\u201d <em> Smack. </em> \u201cOpen.\u201d <em> Smack. </em></p>\n<p>Four red handprints layer on top of each other, staining Atsumu\u2019s skin a deeper shade of pink as they settle in. Kiyoomi\u2019s dick twitches when Atsumu wails something around the gag that sounds suspiciously like <em> I\u2019m sorry. </em></p>\n<p>\u201cIf you do it again, we stop.\u201d</p>\n<p>Atsumu shakes his head, nearly dislodging his blindfold as he rubs his face against the bed and the headboard creaks.</p>\n<p>Kiyoomi pulls on the cold plug once more. This time, Atsumu\u2019s thighs tense but they don\u2019t move, spread wide and quivering as the glass stretches him on the way out. Kiyoomi drops the plug back into the ice bath and places his free hand on Atsumu\u2019s lower back to hold him still as he gets ready to use the last one.</p>\n<p>Watching Atsumu fight his own muscles and struggle not to move when Kiyoomi touches his slick hole with the warm glass is nothing short of intoxicating. He\u2019s stretched enough that he can\u2019t offer any real resistance, and Kiyoomi easily slides the thickest plug home as Atsumu throws his head back and screams into the gag as the heat diffuses into his chilled ass. He\u2019s sure the contrast must make it feel overwhelming.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cGood boy,\u201d Kiyoomi murmurs.</p>\n<p>Atsumu\u2019s cries settle into rhythmic groans every time he breathes as his hips work against the bed, movements jerky and uncoordinated as a bead of sweat drips down the back of his neck. Kiyoomi\u2019s eyes track the droplet and he finds himself overcome with the absurd urge to lick it right off of Atsumu\u2019s skin.</p>\n<p>He blinks and takes a deep breath as Atsumu writhes in front of him. The first part of the scene is done, and Kiyoomi needs to move on to the wax before he does something stupid.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re doing very well, Atsumu,\u201d he says, squeezing one of Atsumu\u2019s reddened ass cheeks. Atsumu moans weakly. \u201cI want you to turn onto your back now, okay? I\u2019ll help you out.\u201d</p>\n<p>Atsumu\u2019s movements are shaky as Kiyoomi helps him turn over, the cuff connector chain twisting where it\u2019s attached to the headboard. It\u2019s as he\u2019s settling into the bed that Kiyoomi sees it: come splattered over his stomach.</p>\n<p><em> \u201cAtsumu,\u201d </em>he breathes, too turned on to care about the desperate tone of his voice. \u201cYou liked it that much?\u201d</p>\n<p>Visible from underneath the blindfold, Atsumu\u2019s cheeks are a furious red. He nods shakily, still squirming.</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you okay to keep going?\u201d</p>\n<p><em> Please say yes, please say yes, please say yes. </em>Obviously, Kiyoomi\u2019s going to respect what Atsumu wants, but he\u2019s been looking forward to seeing Atsumu\u2019s pale skin decorated with lines of black wax.</p>\n<p>Atsumu nods again, more forcefully this time.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kiyoomi blows out a breath he didn\u2019t realize he was holding. \u201cOkay. Remember you have your clicker if you change your mind, at any point.\u201d</p>\n<p>He climbs off the bed and stretches his legs, walking over to his dresser for his matchbox. He could just as easily use a stick lighter for the black pitcher candle, but matches have such a pleasing, distinct sound and smell, one he wants Atsumu to be able to easily identify.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s easier to stand for this part, so Kiyoomi gets right up to the edge of the bed before encouraging Atsumu to scoot toward him, sliding the restraint along the crossbar of the headboard. Once he has Atsumu positioned exactly where he wants him, Kiyoomi reaches for the pitcher candle and pulls a wooden match out of the box.</p>\n<p>Atsumu turns toward the noise when Kiyoomi strikes the match. Kiyoomi smiles and lights the wick, shaking the match to extinguish it. He drops it into the warm water bath and watches Atsumu\u2019s nostrils flare at the smell of smoke and burnt wood.</p>\n<p>He has to wait a little while for the candle to melt enough wax to pour, so Kiyoomi sets it down on the end table and runs both hands over Atsumu\u2019s thighs, relishing the way the muscles tense underneath his skin.</p>\n<p>\u201cRelax, Atsumu,\u201d he murmurs, trailing gloved fingers up and down Atsumu\u2019s sides. \u201cWe\u2019re not anywhere close to finished.\u201d</p>\n<p>A wrinkle appears on Atsumu\u2019s forehead above the blindfold and he whines into the gag, squirming under Kiyoomi\u2019s light touch. He gasps when Kiyoomi runs one hand through the mess on his stomach before wrapping it around his cock, half-softened and undoubtedly oversensitive. Kiyoomi sucks in a breath through his nose and tightens his grip, Atsumu\u2019s own come slicking the way as his dick starts to fill again in Kiyoomi\u2019s hand.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThere you go,\u201d Kiyoomi says. Atsumu\u2019s back arches and he moans obscenely. \u201cIs it still nice and warm inside? Maybe I should switch it out.\u201d</p>\n<p>Atsumu makes a panicked noise and his mouth works around the gag. For all he knows Kiyoomi does have an even bigger cold plug. Kiyoomi almost feels dizzy when he realizes Atsumu\u2019s trying to say <em> Omi. </em> He rubs his thumb underneath the head of Atsumu\u2019s dick as his own twitches against the seam of his slacks.</p>\n<p>Before long, a pool of black wax has formed at the surface of the candle, and Kiyoomi can hardly contain his excitement as he lets go and changes his gloves, gleefully ignoring Atsumu\u2019s needy whine at the loss. He picks up the small pitcher and swirls the wax around, pouring a small drip onto the inside of his wrist to test the temperature and sensation.\u00a0</p>\n<p>A pinpoint burst of heat, almost shocking even when he knows it\u2019s coming ahead of time. Perfect. After a second it mellows out into a simmer, suffusing the surrounding skin with warmth as it starts to harden. Kiyoomi eyes Atsumu\u2019s messy stomach; after a moment of deliberation, he grabs a dry washcloth from the bedside table and wipes him clean, makes himself a blank canvas.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He reaches out and holds the pitcher above Atsumu\u2019s chest, heart beating frantically against his ribs, then tips it carefully until\u2014</p>\n<p>Atsumu jumps in surprise as the first drips of hot wax land on his skin, right between his pecs. He makes a noise that\u2019s a cross between a whimper and a gasp, back arching as the wax cools.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah?\u201d Kiyoomi murmurs, feeling like time has suspended around them. Atsumu nods, drool leaking out a corner of his mouth. \u201cFuck. You\u2019re so\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>He cuts himself off before any of the many embarrassing ways he could finish that sentence come out of his mouth. Atsumu turns toward him, a questioning noise on his lips, but Kiyoomi tips the pitcher again to draw his attention away.</p>\n<p>Instead of droplets, this time the wax lands as a messy line underneath his right pec. Atsumu arches up even higher and moans, body twisting subtly; the bob of his cock draws Kiyoomi\u2019s eyes and he sees that Atsumu is fully hard once more. Forcing his eyes back up to Atsumu\u2019s chest, Kiyoomi considers his next move.</p>\n<p>The dark wax looks delicious against Atsumu\u2019s pale skin. Kiyoomi wants to paint him with it like a piece of fine art.</p>\n<p>He reaches up and pinches Atsumu\u2019s nipples, one after the other, alternating between them until they\u2019re hard and perky. Atsumu makes a desperate sound and writhes, pushing his chest up into Kiyoomi\u2019s hand, but Kiyoomi takes his hand away and holds the candle over him instead.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He tips the pitcher. Black wax stripes over Atsumu\u2019s pec, catching the underside of his nipple. Kiyoomi frowns and doubles back, properly covering the rest of it with molten wax, and his breath catches as Atsumu <em> screams, </em>throwing his head back and shuddering. Even once he\u2019s gone silent Atsumu continues to squirm, grinding his ass down against the mattress, which is when Kiyoomi remembers that he still has the plug in.</p>\n<p>\n<em> You can fuck me, you know. </em>\n</p>\n<p>Kiyoomi grits his teeth and tips the pitcher again, spilling wax onto Atsumu\u2019s stomach and watching the muscles jump underneath his skin. He\u2019s looking prettier with every dark stripe painted onto him, better than Kiyoomi could have imagined. Not that he thought about this <em> that </em>much in the days leading up to it, but\u2026</p>\n<p>He covers Atsumu\u2019s other nipple in wax and hides a manic grin behind his mask when Atsumu\u2019s brows knit together and the headboard creaks from how hard he\u2019s tugging on the restraints. Fuck, he looks so good like this. Can\u2019t see, can\u2019t speak...</p>\n<p>\n<em> You can fuck me, you know. </em>\n</p>\n<p>Kiyoomi curses internally and uses his free hand to adjust himself again. He\u2019s not fucking Atsumu, he promises himself as he suppresses the memory of the mocking permission. If he does, Atsumu would win\u2014at least that\u2019s how it feels\u2014and that concept is currently more painful than the ache between his legs. But... that doesn\u2019t mean Kiyoomi can\u2019t do other things.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Slowly, like he\u2019s in a dream and isn\u2019t in control of his own body, Kiyoomi starts to rub himself through his slacks, rocking the base of his palm against his dick as he bites his lip and rakes his eyes up Atsumu\u2019s body. Atsumu is making so much noise that there\u2019s no way he\u2019s picking up on the subtle rustle of fabric as Kiyoomi presses down over and over, a deep, shameful pleasure taking root at the base of his spine.</p>\n<p>He just.. he\u2019s so\u2026</p>\n<p><em> \u201cMmmnmph,\u201d </em>Atsumu whines, the next stripe of wax hitting just above his belly button.\u00a0</p>\n<p><em> Fuck, </em>it feels good to touch himself after so long without.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI wish you could see yourself like this,\u201d Kiyoomi bites out, pouring another dribble of wax near Atsumu\u2019s collarbone. \u201cYou\u2019re a mess.\u201d</p>\n<p>Atsumu shudders and stops grinding his ass against the bed, cheeks darkening immediately. Kiyoomi presses a little harder on his cock and nearly swears at the relief.</p>\n<p>\u201cI didn\u2019t tell you to stop, Atsumu. Keep fucking yourself on the plug. I want you to come like that.\u201d Atsumu shakes his head even as he starts to do as he\u2019s told. \u201cDon\u2019t give me that. I know you can come without me touching you. Your body\u2019s just that desperate.\u201d</p>\n<p>Kiyoomi is proud of how even his voice comes out. Atsumu groans and rocks down hard, cock twitching against his abs at Kiyoomi\u2019s words. Kiyoomi wonders if he\u2019s ever come untouched from getting fucked. The plug that\u2019s inside him is big, but it\u2019s not as big as\u2026</p>\n<p>He shakes his head, trying unsuccessfully to get rid of the thoughts that have burrowed their way into the deep, primal parts of his brain. It\u2019s horribly tempting, but no matter how tortured Kiyoomi\u2019s thoughts are and how much Atsumu begs for it, Kiyoomi is not going to fuck him.</p>\n<p>He wants so badly to at least get a hand around himself, though. He knows Atsumu wouldn\u2019t mind; he\u2019d be smug about it afterward, but Kiyoomi might be too far gone to care at this point. Atsumu\u2019s reaction after the fact is a problem for future Kiyoomi, because present Kiyoomi is so hard from having Atsumu under his thumb that he can feel himself leaking into his briefs.</p>\n<p>The next stripe of hot wax makes Atsumu shiver and circle his hips, moaning as he shifts the plug inside him. There\u2019s a little puddle of precome underneath the tip of his dick, shiny and sticky against his skin. Further up, his chest and stomach are decorated with beautiful dark stripes, punctuated by dots and a few little pools. Kiyoomi has another candle with white wax that he was planning on using after the black one because the visual contrast is so tantalizing, but instead of the white wax, he could\u2014</p>\n<p>\u201cO\u2019hih\u2026 <em> O\u2019uhh\u2026\u201d </em></p>\n<p>Kiyoomi\u2019s eyes snap up to Atsumu\u2019s face. His lips are pursed around the gag, trying to work around it, drool sliding down the strong line of his jaw.</p>\n<p>\n<em> \u201cOh\u2019ih\u2026\u201d </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em> Omi. </em>\n</p>\n<p>Something in Kiyoomi\u2019s brain snaps.</p>\n<p>He feels oddly calm as he sets the pitcher candle down on the bedside table and pulls off his gloves. Atsumu\u2019s still grinding down against the bed, headboard creaking with his desperate movements. Kiyoomi wants him so badly he\u2019s shaking, so badly it makes him sick.</p>\n<p>Atsumu doesn\u2019t react when Kiyoomi unfastens his slacks with trembling hands, but at the telltale sound of his zipper lowering, Atsumu\u2019s head snaps knowingly in his direction and his eyebrows rise high on his forehead. Kiyoomi\u2019s cheeks burn but he doesn\u2019t stop moving; his dick is so hard that it falls through the opening in his briefs as soon as his zipper\u2019s down.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Atsumu\u2019s lips start to move around the gag like he\u2019s going to try to say something else, or <em> ask </em>something, so Kiyoomi grabs the candle and pours a long line of wax down his torso. Atsumu arches and whines, hips back to full speed as sweat drips down his neck. Kiyoomi keeps the pitcher tightly held in his left hand and, with a deep breath, wraps his right around his dick.</p>\n<p>He hisses out a breath at the contact, barely stopping a moan. Atsumu\u2019s raised brows furrow and he grits out some semblance of Kiyoomi\u2019s name, squirming.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cKeep your hips moving,\u201d Kiyoomi snaps, voice rough and shaky as he thumbs at the wet head of his cock. \u201cI don\u2019t want you stopping until you\u2019re coming all over yourself.\u201d</p>\n<p>\n<em> \u201cMmmnnhh\u2026\u201d </em>\n</p>\n<p>Kiyoomi\u2019s first few strokes are perfunctory, slicking himself up with his own precome, but they feel nauseatingly good. His other hand trembles when he reaches out with the candle and tips a few drops onto Atsumu\u2019s hip. Fuck, it\u2019s going to be hard to do both at once.</p>\n<p>His hand is making unmistakable sounds, slipping over his cock as he settles into a rhythm and it seems to drive Atsumu wild, groans pitching up as his movements grow more frantic. Although Kiyoomi has enough willpower left to resist the urge, there\u2019s no doubt in his mind that Atsumu would let Kiyoomi fuck him right now if he asked. Kiyoomi wouldn\u2019t even <em> have </em> to ask, given what Atsumu told him after their first foray into impact play. He could just shove his way between Atsumu\u2019s legs, pull the plug out and push right in. <em> Fuck. </em></p>\n<p>Kiyoomi no longer trusts himself to speak and Atsumu seems beyond trying to form any more words. His body looks like a work of art, from the dark splatters painting his front to the tension in his muscles to the sweat shining on his skin and matting down his hair. Kiyoomi\u2019s aim with the wax is definitely getting worse as he jerks himself harder, faster, gripping tight and desperately trying not to imagine how it would feel to fuck his sub properly.</p>\n<p>His hand squelches lewdly and more precome beads at the head of his cock. Atsumu seems like he\u2019s lost it, jaw slack around the gag as he fucks himself on the plug, rocking the hot glass into his sweet spot like he doesn\u2019t have enough brainpower left to do anything else. Kiyoomi loves seeing him like this. It makes his belly twist and heat creep down his spine.</p>\n<p>Kiyoomi puts the candle down and lets go of himself long enough to climb back onto the bed, kneeling by Atsumu\u2019s side.</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you gonna come?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Atsumu nods, head bobbing as his hips keep working.</p>\n<p>\u201cGood boy,\u201d Kiyoomi purrs, wrapping his hand back around his own dick.</p>\n<p>Atsumu <em> whines. </em>Kiyoomi wonders what he likes better, being praised or being degraded.</p>\n<p>Probably both at the same time. What a perfect, perfect submissive.</p>\n<p>Fuck, Kiyoomi\u2019s <em> close. </em>His hand speeds up as he fights to keep from fucking into the tight circle of his fingers, eyes locked onto the mess of dark splatters covering Atsumu\u2019s sculpted chest. The dried wax is probably tugging on his nipples every time he arches his back\u2014at least, Kiyoomi hopes it is. Fuck, maybe next time he should ask Atsumu to try the\u2014</p>\n<p>Kiyoomi\u2019s thoughts are derailed when Atsumu arches clean off the bed and starts to come, streaks of white spurting from his cock and painting stark lines across his stomach and chest. He\u2019s <em> sobbing, </em>babbling a garbled mess of Kiyoomi\u2019s name into the gag over and over as tears leak under the blindfold and roll down his cheeks.</p>\n<p>The sight hits Kiyoomi so deep in his gut that his orgasm nearly catches him by surprise and he\u2019s unable to fully stifle his groan as his cock pulses and shoots to join the white mess making its own marks over the dark wax. Atsumu crumples against the bed and nearly thrashes at the feeling, his own cock dribbling another spurt of come onto his abs as Kiyoomi covers him with his release. It\u2019s <em> intense, </em>so all-consuming that it\u2019s all Kiyoomi can do to stay upright as his knees wobble. He makes another low sound and milks the last of it out as Atsumu echoes him with a soft moan.</p>\n<p>When his orgasm is finally over, Kiyoomi lets his eyes flutter closed for a few blissful seconds, listening to his and Atsumu\u2019s breathing as his heart finally starts to slow down. Fuck, that was good.</p>\n<p>However, he\u2019s only afforded a few moments of peace before his eyes pop open and he realizes what he\u2019s done. Shit. Atsumu is going to be <em> intolerably </em> smug about this.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em> Shit. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Walking into Sakusa\u2019s bathroom is strange. It\u2019s odd that Atsumu could have almost no memory of a place where such a pivotal event occurred. The room had blurred out into nothingness beyond the black leather and silicone.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Now returned, with his jaw sore from the very ball gag he once saw hanging from the shower rod, Atsumu can finally appreciate that this is a <em> fucking nice </em>bathroom.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He\u2019s actually pretty surprised Sakusa didn\u2019t lead him down the hall to the guest bathroom; in fact, he\u2019s thankful. Atsumu didn\u2019t go fully under this time, but he still feels super hazy, satisfied to his very core, and the idea of Sakusa disappearing all the way down the hall to set up in the other bathroom makes his stomach twist anxiously. He\u2019s glad that he\u2019d at least been able to hear Sakusa the whole time.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Sakusa, who\u2019s currently steering him towards the frankly stupid shower and bath set up on the far side of the bathroom. That entire half of the room is tiled, floor to ceiling, and sectioned off by a raised lip on the floor. On one side is a deep tub already filled with steaming water. There\u2019s a shower on the other side with stainless steel fixtures plus a bamboo shower stool that Sakusa has set up next to the tub.\u00a0</p>\n<p><em> Sakusa jacked off on him.</em> The thought slides through Atsumu\u2019s liquid mind, still too loose to grab onto anything. The musing alone still sends a deeply pleased shiver down Atsumu\u2019s spine.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Sakusa helps him into the bath, Atsumu gasping lightly as the hot water touches where his skin is a bit sensitive from the wax. His stomach is still tacky with it and the mess that Sakusa could only do so much about with a washcloth. After just a moment of adjustment, the warmth turns from overwhelming to extremely welcome. He hums as he sinks lower into the water, tipping his head back to look up at the recessed lighting in the ceiling. It\u2019s bright and diffused, though Atsumu isn\u2019t sure if that\u2019s from the steam or from his own foggy brain.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cJust soak for a minute, Atsumu,\u201d Sakusa says. \u201cI\u2019m going to change and I\u2019ll be right back.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Atsumu hums again, not quite ready to make himself talk yet. Sakusa goes back into the bedroom and Atsumu lets himself slouch down until the water line is just below his nose. He feels good, too good to have any real thoughts about being in Sakusa\u2019s bathroom taking a soak right now. He supposes two orgasms and a flood of endorphins will do that.\u00a0</p>\n<p>When Sakusa returns, he\u2019s in a pair of athletic shorts and a tank top, mask and gloves removed. Atsumu resists the urge to drunkenly raise his hand out of the tub to give Sakusa thumbs up. It\u2019s a good look on him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Sakusa takes a seat on the bamboo stool. Atsumu sinks a little lower and exhales through his nose, making the top of the water bubble.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t drown,\u201d Sakusa says. \u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d</p>\n<p>Atsumu sits up a bit so he can talk.</p>\n<p><em> \u201cGreat. </em> That was some good shit, Omi-Omi.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Sakusa snorts.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHere,\u201d he says, handing over a washcloth and a small bar of soap. \u201cThe wax is soy-based, so any residue should come off easily now that you\u2019ve been soaking in the water a while.\u201d</p>\n<p>Atsumu takes the rag and begins wiping himself down under the water.\u00a0 He tries to focus on the task but can\u2019t help the next thing that comes out of his mouth, not with what else he knows he\u2019s wiping away besides wax.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSeems like you liked it, too, eh, Omi-kun?\u201d Atsumu says, his stomach swooping as he remembers how he lost it when he realized what was happening. Atsumu glances up to see a softly glaring Sakusa, who doesn\u2019t respond. \u201cIt\u2019s okay that you think I\u2019m irresistibly hot, ya know. Most people do.\u201d</p>\n<p>He levels a sleazy glance upward as he wipes off the last of the wax.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou know I know how to clean well enough that I could drown you in this bathtub and nobody would ever be able to prove that you were in this apartment,\u201d Sakusa says, deadpan.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s not very aftercare-y, Omi-Omi~,\u201d Atsumu sing songs.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou have wax in your hair. How did that even happen?\u201d Sakusa pivots\u2014not very gracefully, which Atsumu can pick up on even in his state.</p>\n<p>Not that he cares much. It\u2019s all icing on the cake to Atsumu. Though, he does wonder what exactly it was he did to get Sakusa to lose control a bit\u2014because he <em> knows </em>by this reaction that Sakusa hadn\u2019t gone into the night planning to do that.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Atsumu wonders what he can do to get it to happen again.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, Omi-kun, you tell me. Gimme some shampoo.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you want me to go grab your hair stuff from your bag?\u201d Sakusa asks, though he reaches over to grab his own off the ledge and offers it to Atsumu, who reads the label carefully.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, this is fine,\u201d Atsumu says, unsurprised that Sakusa has decent quality hair products. He does have those shiny curls, after all.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He squeezes some shampoo into his palm and goes to raise his arms; his shoulders twinge hard and he makes a low noise, hesitating. <em> \u201cOw </em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>Maybe he got a little exuberant with pulling on the restraints. He doesn\u2019t remember doing it, but his upper back and arms are certainly telling him that it happened.</p>\n<p>\u201cHere,\u201d Sakusa says, and suddenly a hand is scraping the shampoo out of Atsumu\u2019s palm. \u201cFace away from me and tip your head back.\u201d</p>\n<p><em> Oh. </em>Okay, then.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Atsumu does as he\u2019s told, tipping his head back over the lip of the tub to let Sakusa use the showerhead to re-wet his hair and then work the shampoo in. The long fingers against his scalp are something else, and Atsumu feels his heart start to race. It feels <em> intimate </em>. His eyes slide shut of his own accord and he forces down a happy groan that threatens to climb out of his throat.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He needs a distraction.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo, your bathroom is fancy as fuck,\u201d Atsumu starts. \u201cLike, your whole place is really nice. I\u2019ve been meaning to ask, is your family super rich or something?\u201d</p>\n<p>Atsumu pretty much expects Sakusa not to answer at all, but that\u2019s not what happens. Sakusa combs his fingers over the patch of hair that somehow got wax in it, gently working the material out.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYes. My father has a high ranking position at an investment firm and his father had family money as well,\u201d Sakusa says bluntly.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d Atsumu says intelligently as Sakusa rinses his hair. \u201cDo you, uh, see them much? Your family?\u201d</p>\n<p>The water shuts off and Atsumu\u2019s getting ready to sit up when he feels hands in his hair again. Oh, conditioner. How thoughtful.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNot really. My siblings are much older and have their own lives. My father took a job in Hong Kong when I was very young and my mother joined him there after I graduated high school. I only really see them around New Years.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d Atsumu says again.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine. They\u2019re not exactly pleasant people.\u201d</p>\n<p>It\u2019s not exactly effusive or particularly forthcoming, but considering Atsumu had known<em> nothing </em> about Sakusa\u2019s family life besides the fact that Komori Motoya was his cousin, a strange sense of warmth wells up in his chest now. He can\u2019t help but laugh a little, which is probably rude, but when he cracks his eye open and looks up, there\u2019s half of a tiny smirk on Sakusa\u2019s face. They always did have a similar sense of (bad) humor.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAlright. Tell me about your rich-person house growing up, though. Was it traditional or western style?\u201d</p>\n<p>Warm water cascades through Atsumu\u2019s hair and fingers press into his crown. The bathroom feels like a space out of time for a bit, and Atsumu doesn\u2019t fight it. He just sits there, with Sakusa Kiyoomi washing his hair, and listens to his unenthusiastic description of a mansion on the outskirts of Tokyo and its various structural problems.\u00a0</p>"
