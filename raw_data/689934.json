  "text": "<p>The sorcerer is caught for nothing more than a simple conjuring trick, done in the marketplace to help an old woman lift a heavy load. He is an older man, with no distinguishing characteristics except his extraordinary normalcy. Even after presiding over his trial, Arthur couldn\u2019t really describe him at all. He is plain but well-spoken, does not deny the charges and does not rage against the sentence. After Arthur announces it\u2014death by beheading, the usual punishment for sorcerers\u2014Leon nods to a troop of guards to lead him back to his cell, and he goes quietly. </p>\n<p>\u201cThat was odd.\u201d Gwaine says what they\u2019re all thinking, voices what Arthur can\u2019t. He\u2019s wondered, sometimes, if Merlin coached him in that role before he left, or if it just comes naturally to him. Arthur likes to think Merlin coached him, left something of him behind. </p>\n<p>\u201cIt was,\u201d Percival agrees, and walks forward towards the thrones. It feels empty in here, nowadays, without Gwen and Lancelot. Without Merlin, the oldest hurt. </p>\n<p>Leon hovers by the door, looks at it anxiously. \u201cSire, it could be a trap.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cFor what?\u201d Arthur drums his fingers against the arm of his throne. \u201cHe didn\u2019t attack when he could. We know those cells can hold sorcerers, they always have before. What could he be trying to do?\u201d</p>\n<p>The knights are all silent. \u201cNo, really, what?\u201d Arthur demands, harshly. He hates dealing with sorcerers. He sees Morgana in each one, Morgana before she was what she is now, and never knows what to do. He can\u2019t even tell if they\u2019re all evil anymore, or just dangerous. It\u2019s been ten years since he became king, ten years of beheadings and deaths, and he still doesn\u2019t know. \u201cThat was a question.\u201d</p>\n<p>No answers. Arthur sighs. They\u2019re all military men, and though he values them for it, each for their strength and loyalty and intelligence, he sometimes wishes he had someone beside him who thought on different lines. He has Gaius, of course, but he comes down rarely; the trip is too hard on old bones. But Merlin left, and Gwen did, and now he sometimes feels off-balance, like he\u2019s supposed to have someone at his side to counteract him. He wonders if this is how his father felt, if this is what made him who he was. \u201cWell, he\u2019ll be dead in the morning. Double the guard for tonight, just in case.\u201d</p>\n<p>Leon nods and leads the rest of the knights out. At the door, Gwaine, the last of them, pauses. \u201cWhat was his name?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHm?\u201d Arthur looks up from his inspection of the day\u2019s petitions. </p>\n<p>\u201cI can\u2019t remember his name. Can you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course.\u201d Arthur remembers the name of everyone he ever put to death. \u201cIt was\u2014\u201d Huh. \u201cIt must have just slipped my mind, I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll get it in a second.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Gwaine\u2019s gaze is clearly skeptical, but he leaves, his cloak less billowy than usual. </p>\n<p>Something is definitely not right. </p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>The sorcerer (and Arthur still can\u2019t remember his name, and it\u2019s starting to irritate him) is led to the block at dawn. He goes as quietly as he did from the throne room, his hands chained behind him, guards on either side. There\u2019s a crowd, as there always is, children lifted onto their fathers\u2019 shoulders for a better view. Arthur stands alone on the balcony, and parrots his father\u2019s words to the people, who roar back. Their approval, or their excitement, or their disapproval, its impossible to tell. Gwen had looked calm and regal. Merlin had simply set his face into stony determination which Arthur had always understood to be tacit disapproval. </p>\n<p>He gives a sign; the headsman raises his axe. Arthur will give the sorcerer this, he doesn\u2019t flinch. At least he is dying with honor. The axe falls. </p>\n<p>It bounces off the sorcerer\u2019s neck. </p>\n<p>The crowd\u2019s instinctive gasp is cut off into confusion. The headsman pauses, then raises his axe again. It still doesn\u2019t work. He looks towards Arthur. </p>\n<p>His father never had to deal with anything like this. \u201cGet him another axe,\u201d Arthur calls to Elyan, who\u2019s captaining the guards today. Elyan nods, snaps orders to a page. </p>\n<p>The new axe doesn\u2019t work any better than the first. The crowd is getting restless, deprived of the spectacle it was promised. It\u2019s at times like these that crowds can turn quickly into mobs, Arthur knows, though they have never done so for him. He orders the sorcerer brought back inside. </p>\n<p>The man goes back to his cell, with the same long, loping stride he came with, his lips still curved in a something that could be a smile or simply determination. </p>\n<p>* </p>\n<p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t he take advantage of it?\u201d Arthur demands, hours later. He paces the council room, back and forth in front of the table. It\u2019s nagging at him. He doesn\u2019t like it when he can\u2019t see people\u2019s motivations, he doesn\u2019t trust it. Morgana taught him clearly that something as simple as love didn\u2019t work. Gwen and Lancelot finished the job. \u201cHe turned the people against me. He could have taunted. Hell, he could have said something!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMaybe he\u2019s mute. Ow!\u201d Gwaine winces at Percival elbows him in the side. Even in full armor, that isn\u2019t a simple proposition when the elbower is as big as Percival. </p>\n<p>\u201cWe heard him talk.\u201d Elyan looks to Arthur. \u201cRight?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe did,\u201d Arthur confirms. He remembers it. Or, if not the words exactly, the feel of it, the calm resignation and simple defense. Something about just wanting to help, or him not wanting to hide. \u201cHe can talk, he just didn\u2019t.\u201d He stalks to the other side of the room. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t make any sense! What does he want?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou could ask him.\u201d Leon\u2019s voice is quiet, but it sounds loudly. Arthur whirls to face him, and Leon takes a step back and holds up his hands. \u201cIt can\u2019t hurt, can it?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe could cast a spell on me. That could be what he\u2019s planning.\u201d That made a certain amount of sense. Sorcerers seemed to get a fair amount of pleasure from casting spells on him. </p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll talk to him.\u201d Of course Gwaine volunteers. The man bounces on the balls of his feet,. \u201cNo point in enchanting me.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cCouldn\u2019t get through your thick head, anyway,\u201d Elyan inserts, and Gwaine grins back at him. </p>\n<p>It\u2019s not what Arthur wants, which is the sorcerer just to act, to do something that makes sense, but it\u2019s a plan at least. \u201cFine. Gwaine, go now. Report back to my chambers. And\u2014\u201d Gwaine raises his eyebrows from the door. Merlin would never have forgiven him if he allows Gwaine to be hurt. Arthur can\u2019t stand up to Merlin\u2019s disappointed looks even in his imagination. \u201cBe careful. No unnecessary risks.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSince when do I take unnecessary risks?\u201d Gwaine asks, and is gone with a swirl of his cloak that Arthur is fairly sure he practices in the mirror before any of the rest of them can start the list. </p>\n<p>He reports back an hour later. The other knights have gone, so it is just Arthur at his desk. George is long gone\u2014Arthur does not actually need anyone to help him into his nightclothes, thank you very much. He is not helpless. Though he still sometimes feels like he is arguing with Merlin when he is insisting on that. Merlin, who never really left the rooms except when Gwen was there, who would sit in a corner and polish Arthur\u2019s mail or sharpen his sword as Arthur worked, filling in the silence with chatter or gossip or just as an ear to bounce ideas off of. Merlin, who was always there for him. Until he wasn\u2019t anymore. </p>\n<p>Gwaine strides in and sits down across from Arthur without asking. \u201cSo what\u2019d he say?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2014\u201d Gwaine\u2019s forehead creases. \u201cDon\u2019t stop me, I\u2019ll forget again. I\u2019ve been saying it to myself since I left. He said that he has no agenda, that he didn\u2019t want to hurt anyone but he didn\u2019t particularly feel like dying either. And that\u2019s a direct quote. I think.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s all?\u201d Arthur demands. That\u2014since when do sorcerers not want to hurt anyone? All sorcerers want to hurt people. Arthur\u2019s never met one who hasn\u2019t. Even Morgana, who he once thought more honorable and good than anyone, when she had glared him into defending the weak before he had found Merlin to do it for her. </p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I remember. It\u2019s the important things.\u201d Gwaine leans forward, braces his elbows on the table. \u201cI think he\u2019s telling the truth, Arthur. He didn\u2019t make any sort of aggressive move at all.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cHe could be stalling, or playing at being harmless so we let his guard down,\u201d Arthur counters. He looks at the papers on his desk, unseeing. He wishes he had someone to talk all this over with. The knights try, Leon is, as always, his right hand, but they won\u2019t really question him or his laws. Not even Gwaine, for all his petty rebellions. He needs the Morgana for Uther. He needs his Merlin. \u201cAnd he broke the law. Tomorrow, he\u2019ll hang.\u201d</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>When they try to hang him, he floats. </p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>They put him on the pyre at dawn. </p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t burn.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Nightshade is forced down his throat. There is no pain. </p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>After the poison, Arthur is getting more than a little irritated. The sorcerer just isn\u2019t doing anything. He isn\u2019t attacking, he isn\u2019t even talking, although he\u2019s apparently perfectly willing to chat with anyone who wants. He\u2019s not even trying to escape. He\u2019s just\u2014not dying. It\u2019s frustrating. Not even Gaius can explain it; the best he can come up with is that maybe he means what he says. </p>\n<p>Arthur storms into the dungeons in high dudgeon. The sorcerer is sitting in his cell, idly making shapes of fire appear over his palm. He closes his hand over a falcon and rises when Arthur slams open the door. \u201cYour Highness!\u201d he says, with a smile and a bow\u2014the kind of bow one would learn at court. \u201cHow nice of you to drop by. I would offer you some refreshments, but, well,\u201d he gestures, takes in the cell, which isn\u2019t inhumane but certainly isn\u2019t comfortable. \u201cthere doesn\u2019t seem to be anything I can do.\u201d</p>\n<p>Arthur ignores him, stalks right up to the bars. \u201cWhat\u2019s your game?\u201d he demands, in a low, soft hiss. </p>\n<p>\u201cMy game? I like chess, personally, though I\u2019m not averse to dice.\u201d He\u2019s relaxed, easy in a way he shouldn\u2019t be when the king himself is there to threaten him. </p>\n<p>\u201cI mean,\u201d Arthur hisses, \u201cWhat is your plan?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s not a very clever question, is it?\u201d The sorcerer leans against the wall, smiles guilelessly at Arthur. \u201cIf I have a devious plan, I\u2019d hardly tell it to you. And you haven\u2019t believed me before when I say I haven\u2019t one, so you probably won\u2019t believe me now.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cYou have to be planning something. Why would you be here, otherwise?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMaybe I like the housing.\u201d</p>\n<p>Arthur snorts before remembers not to. That involuntary sympathy makes him harsher when he says, \u201cI could starve you out. Stop bringing you food.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou could. Wouldn\u2019t be very noble, very kingly, mistreating a prisoner, but you could.\u201d For a second, Arthur could almost imagine Morgana saying that, accusing his\u2014their\u2014father. But the sorcerer\u2019s not smiling anymore. Instead, his face is very, very serious, though still not angry. He looks almost like Merlin did, sometimes, when he felt that Arthur was about to do something wrong. \u201cOf course, why would that work better than anything else you\u2019ve tried to do?\u201d</p>\n<p>It hurts. It hurts because it\u2019s right, because Arthur knows that he would never do that. It hurts because he looks like Merlin and he\u2019s standing in a cell, which is in its way all too familiar. It hurts because no one since Merlin has made Arthur hurt like this, feel like he\u2019s not living up to the king he could be. </p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll figure you out,\u201d he says, threatens. \u201cI will.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you will,\u201d the sorcerer says, and it sounds almost patronizing. \u201cCould we skip drowning, though? I get colds.\u201d Arthur scowls and storms out. </p>\n<p>\u201cArthur.\u201d Arthur stops, looks back. The sorcerer is standing in the center of his cell. He opens his palm and a dragon made of fire flies out. It swoops towards Arthur, around him, just close enough that Arthur can feel the heat, before it returns to the sorcerer and wraps itself around the his neck like a scarf. The fire flicks light up, makes the sorcerer\u2019s hair look dark, his skin pale. In that moment, Arthur does hate him, because he has gotten over Merlin\u2019s abandonment. Or at least, until now, he\u2019s managed to convince himself it doesn\u2019t hurt. That there aren\u2019t too many holes in his heart. \u201cI only want to live as myself. Is that too much to ask?\u201d</p>\n<p>Arthur closes the door rather than answer. The sorcerer could have burned him, killed him, with that dragon, as easy as you please. </p>\n<p>He didn\u2019t. And Arthur doesn\u2019t know what that means. </p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>They pull him up from the depths of the lake after an hour. As he walks past Arthur, he sneezes. Pointedly. </p>\n<p>Arthur almost laughs.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Gwaine stumbles into the council room dripping with blood. </p>\n<p>If it were anyone but Gwaine, this would be a cause for concern, but it being Gwaine, it\u2019s a bit more of a usual occasion. </p>\n<p>When Elyan comes in after him, similarly covered in blood, everyone is on their feet in an instant. </p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s a\u2014thing,\u201d Gwaine gasps out, taking the seat that Percival shoves at him. </p>\n<p>\u201cLike a horse, but an eagle,\u201d Elyan sags back against his chair. </p>\n<p>Leon and Arthur\u2019s eyes meet over the wounded men\u2019s heads. Another griffin? Lancelot only barely killed the last one. </p>\n<p>\u201cOur weapons couldn\u2019t touch it,\u201d Gwaine says. He sounds stronger now\u2014probably more exhaustion than wounds, Arthur assesses with a practiced eye. \u201cWe drove it away from the village, but there was nothing more we could do.\u201d There\u2019s the anger now, the anger that made Arthur believe he could be a knight. Anger that he couldn\u2019t do more. </p>\n<p>\u201cBody of a horse?\u201d he asks instead, \u201cAre you sure? Not a lion?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNever seen a lion,\u201d Gwaine shakes his head, \u201cBut I know a horse.\u201d Elyan nods his agreement. </p>\n<p>\u201cGet Gaius,\u201d Arthur snaps to a page, who darts out of the room. Then, to another, \u201cWater for the knights.\u201d He goes, too.</p>\n<p>By the time Gaius arrives, Elyan and Gwaine are both more comfortable. Both are riddled in scratches, but nothing more serious, thank God. At their description, though, Gaius shakes his head. \u201cYou\u2019re sure it wasn\u2019t a griffin?\u201d he asks. </p>\n<p>\u201cPositive,\u201d Elyan grits out between clenched teeth, as the old man dabs at his wounds with a rag. \u201cHorse body. Roan.\u201d </p>\n<p>Gaius nods, slowly. \u201cI\u2014it could be\u2014here, my book.\u201d The page brings him a book. Gaius pages through it until he finds a page and lets it fall open. </p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s it!\u201d Gwaine exclaims, half-rising, then settles back with a groan. </p>\n<p>\u201cA hippogriff,\u201d Gaius reads. \u201cHalf horse, half eagle. It\u2019s the product of a griffin mating with a horse.\u201d Arthur can see the same disgusted expression on his men\u2019s faces as on his. \u201cIt\u2019s very rare, not much is known about it. But it is said that like its parent, it cannot be killed but with magic.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe killed the griffin without magic,\u201d Arthur observes. </p>\n<p>Gaius\u2019s face shifts, for an instant, but then it stills. \u201cOf course, your highness, but Lancelot was very, very lucky then. We cannot count on the same circumstances another time.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cHe was good at being lucky,\u201d Arthur mutters. The knights pretend not to hear him. Then, louder, \u201cSo what can we do?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI do not know.\u201d Gaius hesitates, then adds, \u201cPerhaps there is someone we might ask.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2014Gaius, no,\u201d Arthur protests as he realizes what the physician is talking about. He has avoided the sorcerer since his failed drowning, letting the man languish in his cell instead. Maybe he\u2019ll get bored; it\u2019s about the only weapon they have against him. And Arthur doesn\u2019t like how easy it was to laugh at him, with him; how quickly he got to him. It\u2019s uncanny, frightening in a way that has nothing to do with magic. Arthur doesn\u2019t like to remember what it was like to be easy with someone. </p>\n<p>\u201cIt may be the only way, Sire,\u201d Gaius says. And then he uses his eyebrows, and Arthur has no choice. Maybe he should put the sorcerer to death by Gaius\u2019s eyebrows. There would be no way out of that. </p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>\u201cYour Highness.\u201d Once more, the sorcerer sweeps him that formal bow. \u201cWhat brings you down here on this beautiful\u2014\u201d he squints out the slit of a window, wrinkles his nose as he guesses, \u201cEvening?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNight, really.\u201d Arthur breathes in and out. He needs the man now. He can humble himself for his peoples\u2019 sake. If there is one thing he learned from Morgana, it is that, both from seeing her keep her dignity in disgrace, and in what she has forced him to do since then. \u201cI\u2019ve come to ask something.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAsk away.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cWhat do you know about hippogriffs?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHippogriffs?\u201d the sorcerer cocks his head to the side as he thinks. It\u2019s a motion Arthur can almost remember, that almost seems familiarly ridiculous, but as he starts to think about it, it slides away. \u201cAren\u2019t they when for some reason a griffin mates with a horse? And\u2014oh.\u201d Arthur can see the realization slide over his eyes. \u201cIt can only be killed by magic.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s no other way?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNot that I know of.\u201d The sorcerer shrugs. \u201cI don\u2019t know everything, obviously. Gaius would be a better person to ask.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve already asked him. And how do you know about Gaius?\u201d Is Gaius the focus of his plans? The man is old, shouldn\u2019t he be left out of it by now? \u201cIf you harm one hair on his head, I swear, I will find a way to make you suffer. I will hunt to the ends of the earth to find\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cArthur.\u201d The shock of his name makes him stop. The sorcerer\u2019s eyes are large and meet his gaze unflinchingly. \u201cI swear by anything we both find holy that I mean no harm to Gaius.\u201d His voice resonates, echoes in the small chamber, and Arthur can\u2019t find it in him to disbelieve it. Though he has thought that before, to his grief. Merlin\u2019s judgment was always better. </p>\n<p>\u201cFine. So\u2014\u201d He swallows down the residual anger, the anger also at the fact that he does believe the sorcerer. \u201cWill you help us?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHm?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWill you help fight the hippogriff in exchange for your release?\u201d It\u2019ll be releasing a dangerous criminal, but the hippogriff is the greater threat, and it\u2019s not like they were particularly hurting the sorcerer anyway. He is already gesturing to the guard, to get the keys to release him, when the sorcerer answers. </p>\n<p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat? Do you not want your freedom? I warn you, this will only be offered once.\u201d Who refuses their freedom? </p>\n<p>\u201cI will not go from here because of a ill-made deal through desperation,\u201d the sorcerer explains. He sounds almost sad. \u201cI\u2019d just get back in here anyway, after a bit more magic.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cSo you won\u2019t help us. Wonderful. We\u2019ll figure it out on our own.\u201d He turns to leave. Before he does, though, he feels heat behind him, and the dragon sweeps towards him again. It curls around his sword, close enough to Arthur\u2019s thigh that he should burn but without any heat, then dissipates, as if it sunk through the sheath. </p>\n<p>The sorcerer is looking after him with worried, sad eyes. It has been a long time since someone looked at him like that as he left, more worry for the man than the king. Not since\u2014not since months before Gwen left. Since Merlin left. \u201cGood luck, my lord.\u201d </p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Arthur raises his hand to strike down the hippogriff. His sword glows blue as it plunges into the beast and pins it to the ground in its death throes. </p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>\u201cThank you.\u201d It\u2019s hard to say, but Arthur has grown since he was a teenager, and he can bring himself to say it. </p>\n<p>The sorcerer starts, and his eyes close and his lips quirk into something that is almost too resigned, too painfully amused, to be a smile. \u201cI\u2019m glad to see you safe.\u201d</p>\n<p>Arthur looks at the bars. \u201cAre you sure you don\u2019t want your freedom?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s not why I did it.\u201d He sounds like the best part of Lancelot, the part that would do anything for anyone and never mention it. He sounds like the best part of Merlin, who never asked for thanks. \u201cI will stay here until it is no longer forbidden for me to go.\u201d</p>\n<p>He sits down in the back of the cell, crosses his legs. His fist closes, opens again. A fiery shape appears\u2014Uther\u2019s head. \u201cIt\u2019s interesting. Uther was willing to use magic in desperate times as well.\u201d His hand closes, opens. Now it\u2019s Morgana\u2019s head that floats there, as she was growing up, proud and strong and tall and brilliant. \u201cI think that\u2019s what really did it. The hypocrisy. Not the hatred. She could respect the hatred.\u201d </p>\n<p>Arthur is at the bars before he could think. \u201cDon\u2019t you dare\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cJust an observation.\u201d Once more the fingers\u2014long fingers, like some he\u2019s seen before somewhere\u2014open, close. It\u2019s Arthur\u2019s face this time. \u201cYou\u2019ve never had to be your father\u2019s son, Arthur.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cI know.\u201d Of all the things Merlin had given him, that might be the best\u2014another way to look at things, the knowledge that his father was not the be all and end all. </p>\n<p>The sorcerer looks up, with a crooked smile on his face. The torchlight dances in blue eyes. \u201cSo you say. Then why do you hate magic?\u201d It\u2019s the question they always ask. </p>\n<p>\u201cBecause sorcerers try to kill me all to often.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo do swords,\u201d the sorcerer observes. \u201cDo you hate them too?\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cSwords can be used for good,\u201d Arthur shoots back. His knuckles are white on the bars. </p>\n<p>\u201cAnd so can magic.\u201d The sorcerer rises, more easily than he should for his age, and walks to the bars. Arthur refuses to move back. The sorcerer gestures, and his eyes flash, not reddish or yellow, like Arthur has seen before, but a pure clear gold. A flower drops into Arthur\u2019s hand\u2014he remembers that flower. It was burned into his memory. A mortaeus flower. \u201cRemember that.\u201d </p>\n<p>Arthur does back away then, fingering the flower. So few knew about that\u2014Gwen, Gaius, Merlin, him. Gaius wouldn\u2019t have said anything. Arthur didn\u2019t. </p>\n<p>\u201cIs this a threat?\u201d he says, slowly. No one has heard from Merlin for years, as far as Arthur knows. He got a few letters, the first year, but then those stopped. It\u2019s not like Arthur could have answered back, anyway. It\u2019s not like he would have wanted to. Lancelot can take care of Gwen, clearly. Merlin cannot take care of himself. It has always amazed Arthur that he made it to Camelot on his own. He has to believe, though, that Merlin is bumbling through the forests somehow, finding whatever it was that made him look at Arthur, all those years ago, and announce that as Arthur seemed pretty well set up now, he could go. That he has found whatever it was he needed more than Arthur. </p>\n<p>The sorcerer blinks, once, then sinks back down to the floor, laughing hysterically. \u201cArthur,\u201d he gasps out between breaths, \u201cOh, Arthur, that is the farthest thing from a threat.\u201d</p>\n<p>That hysterical laughter follows Arthur out of the dungeons. </p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>There is no attempted execution the next day. </p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Nor the next.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Arthur goes back down to the dungeons the next day. He\u2019s not sure why. If anyone asked, he would have reasons\u2014to inspect the condition of the prisoner, to ask him about some obscure point of magic, to make sure the laughter didn\u2019t mean he was going insane\u2014but none of those are true. Well, maybe the last, a little, because after Morgana he is apprehensive. He goes because\u2026because he does. </p>\n<p>He opens the door quietly, politely this time. Gaius is standing at the bars, his head nearly meeting the sorcerer\u2019s. That\u2019s quite a walk for Gaius, these days. Sometimes Arthur considers trying to send Merlin a message, or maybe just sending a knight out with one, to tell him that he should come back soon, to say his good-byes. Those thoughts usually come on the nights he spends alone, listening to no one\u2019s breathing beside him. </p>\n<p>\u201c\u2014won\u2019t hide anymore,\u201d the sorcerer is muttering. He sounds younger than he looks. </p>\n<p>Arthur can\u2019t see Gaius\u2019s face, but he knows that tilt of his head. He\u2019s using the eyebrows. \u201cThen what is this? Isn\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYour Highness!\u201d The sorcerer cuts him off, and Gaius turns and bows clumsily, as if surprised. Arthur stays back, in the doorway. He trusts Gaius, completely, even with the sorcery in his past\u2014but this still makes him nervous. </p>\n<p>\u201cGaius,\u201d he says, with a slow nod, \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cJust checking on the prisoner\u2019s health,\u201d Gaius says. His eyes shift to the side, like they used to when he was claiming Merlin was in the tavern. Arthur still wonders where Merlin actually went; he stopped believing the tavern story when, once, there was not whiff of beer on him later that night. But Merlin had long since earned his freedom, and Arthur could not quite convince himself he had a right to him beyond the hours of his service.</p>\n<p>Still, given that Arthur doesn\u2019t have a good reason for being here either, he doesn\u2019t press. \u201cWill you be able to get upstairs on your own?\u201d He asks instead. </p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll manage, thank you, Sire.\u201d Gaius nods, moves slowly towards the door. The sorcerer watches him hobble out, leaning heavily on his stick. </p>\n<p>\u201cYou take good care of him,\u201d he says, when the door closes behind Gaius. </p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s had years of loyal service to my family.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s the only reason?\u201d The sorcerer smiles, slightly, knowingly, almost teasingly, and leans against the sidewall of the cell. </p>\n<p>Arthur shrugs. \u201cHe\u2019s been my physician since I can remember.\u201d He\u2019s the only almost-family left, it feels like sometimes, with Uther dead and Morgana\u2026gone. The Morgana he had known and loved. There\u2019s barely anyone in Camelot who knew him before he was king\u2014Leon, of course, but Gwen has left, and Merlin, even Lancelot, all his old friends. He needs Gaius to remain. \u201cHe\u2019s\u2026a close friend.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cA friend?\u201d The sorcerer raises his eyebrow. It looks almost like Gaius. \u201cA king can have a freedman for a friend?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cA king can have a servant for a friend,\u201d Arthur replies, and leaves it at that. Wherever Merlin is, if this sorcerer someday sees him again, Arthur hopes he tells him that. He\u2019s not sure he ever said it. He\u2019s not sure he knew it until after Merlin left. </p>\n<p>The sorcerer\u2019s smile widens, until it\u2019s a full-fledged grin, and his eyes are bright and there are dimples in his cheeks. Arthur is sure he\u2019s seen it before, somewhere\u2014\u201cSo what brings you down to my humble chambers, Sire?\u201d the sorcerer asks with a cheerful bounce, and the thought is gone. \u201cYou\u2019ve been lax in your burnings lately.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo use wasting wood,\u201d Arthur counters. He crosses his arms across his chest. \u201cI wanted to\u2026\u201d he trails off. </p>\n<p>\u201cYou wanted to talk to me,\u201d the sorcerer concludes. His lips press together like he\u2019s trying to avoid smiling, badly, like Merlin trying not to laugh at his prince. </p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Arthur snaps. He has other people to talk to, better people, who don\u2019t use magic and aren\u2019t in cells. \u201cI\u2019m just making sure you\u2019ve been well treated. Camelot owes you a great debt.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCamelot owes me nothing,\u201d the sorcerer waves a hand, dismissing it, and sinks to the ground so he can sit. \u201cBut you could help me in one thing\u2014and no, it\u2019s not traitorous. Obviously. Just\u2014tell me about the court? It\u2019s boring down here, with nothing to do.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cConjure yourself some books,\u201d Arthur grumbles. He\u2019s been on his feet all day, training with the knights than a council than there was an issue in the kitchens he had to work out. He sits down as well, leaning against a wall. \u201cWhat do you want to know?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGossip,\u201d the sorcerer says, promptly, and Arthur laughs. </p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>He ends up in the dungeons often during the next month. It\u2019s easier, sometimes, to talk about things with someone other than his knights, who are bound to him and only disagree on tactics. They are good men, all of them, but not people Arthur can talk to, not like he talked to Gwen, to Merlin. And if Arthur always hears a voice that sounds like his father\u2019s in his head as he goes down, warning him that he is spilling secrets to an enemy, he ignores it. He has stopped trying to figure out the sorcerer\u2019s plans. He wasn\u2019t getting anywhere with it. This is nothing Morgana doesn\u2019t know already, in its essence. </p>\n<p>\u201cI never knew how much work running a castle was,\u201d he complains one day, taking his seat on the crimson cushion he brought. The sorcerer looks up\u2014he was using air today, swirling dust into figures in what Arthur guesses is his main amusement. It has ceased to disturb him. </p>\n<p>\u201cAs opposed to the kingdom?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, I knew that. But the castle itself\u2014who gives a damn about the court ladies\u2019 amusements? Balls are awful enough in themselves.\u201d Arthur shudders. He remembers the years of being paraded like a prize horse. \u201cBut musicales? Listening to them play?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd you didn\u2019t have to do this before?\u201d the sorcerer asks, with a hint of skepticism. \u201cYou have been king for years.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNot really. My father dealt with it, somehow, and then Gwen\u2014\u201d He cuts himself off. He has, purposefully or not, avoided talking about her with the sorcerer. He can\u2019t tell if it\u2019s because he doesn\u2019t want to make her vulnerable, or himself. \u201cBut then Gwen left,\u201d he finishes, and stares at the cushion\u2019s fringe. </p>\n<p>\u201cI heard,\u201d the sorcerer says. The laughter has gone from his voice; he sounds sad, weary. \u201cI am sorry.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo is everyone.\u201d It\u2019s out before Arthur thinks better of it, out before Arthur realizes the anger in it. \u201cEveryone\u2019s sorry. Sorry your wife cuckolded you. Sorry the woman you love didn\u2019t love you back. Sorry\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShe loved you.\u201d His rant cut off just as he was building up steam, Arthur jerks his head up to look at the sorcerer. He is leaning forward, his eyes intense under dark brows, the intensity Merlin had when he needed Arthur to believe him. \u201cWhatever else happened\u2014I can\u2019t know that, can\u2019t know what happened between you, between her and Lancelot\u2014she did love you.\u201d</p>\n<p>No one has said that to him before. \u201cHow do you know?\u201d he asks, because how can he trust what this man who has never met her, never known her, has to say? </p>\n<p>\u201cWould you believe me if I said magic?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThen magic.\u201d</p>\n<p>Arthur huffs out a breath, unwillingly amused. He hasn\u2019t laughed so much in years as he does with the sorcerer. Not even with Gwen, whom he loved, had loved, who had meant everything to him, but who had never quite known how to joke with him. Maybe that\u2019s why she left. Merlin had made him laugh, like no one had before or since. </p>\n<p>\u201cThen why\u2019d she leave?\u201d he voices. Not that he\u2019s going to trust anything the sorcerer says, but another opinion is always good. </p>\n<p>The sorcerer shrugs. \u201cI can\u2019t know\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo you said\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI can\u2019t know,\u201d the sorcerer begins again, impressively. \u201cBut\u2014if I had to guess\u2014\u201d he fiddles with the straw of his cell for a moment, then looks up to meet Arthur\u2019s eyes. \u201cIf you had to choose, Camelot\u2019s happiness or Guinevere, which would you choose?\u201d</p>\n<p>Arthur opens his mouth, pauses, then answers. \u201cI threatened to run away with her once, to leave my position as the heir so we could marry.\u201d He can hardly remember the boy he was then, madly in love and blown away by it. He can barely remember that sort of love.</p>\n<p>The sorcerer smiles indulgently. \u201cAnd would you have gone through with it?\u201d</p>\n<p>Arthur lets out a breath. \u201cNo.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWould Lancelot?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d Arthur answers immediately. Lancelot would have walked through fire and water for Gwen, would have\u2014would\u2014do anything to keep her safe and happy and warm. He would have, did, give up everything for her. </p>\n<p>Arthur would have too, he guesses, if it had just been him. But he couldn\u2019t just be him, not while he wore the crown, not while his people depended on him, not while he sees his people suffering or happy through his actions. </p>\n<p>He tries to remember the last time he had dinner with Guinevere rather than his council. He can\u2019t.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo it\u2019s all my fault.\u201d Arthur stares dully at the floor. That\u2019s a new way of looking at things. </p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not your fault.\u201d There is a sudden fierceness in the sorcerer\u2019s tone, one that hadn\u2019t even been there when he defended himself. \u201cYou are who you are. Gwen knew that when she married you. She is the one who broke her vows, not you.\u201d The fierceness subsides, and there is something oddly like nostalgia in his voice, like wistfulness. \u201cJust remember that it can be her fault and still be understandable.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI suppose.\u201d Arthur sighs, leans back and stares up at the sliver of light that comes through the tiny cell window. \u201cBut how am I supposed to know all that? That\u2019s what she was for. That\u2019s what Merlin was for. He was good with feelings.\u201d Too good, that girl, Arthur remembers ruefully. Couldn\u2019t even go hunting without crying for the poor baby deer. </p>\n<p>\u201cMerlin?\u201d The sorcerer asks. His head is tilted to the side, big ears almost perked with interest. \u201cWho\u2019s he?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMy servant,\u201d Arthur answers shortly. \u201cHe left.\u201d It\u2019s not like with Gwen. Clearly. Because he was not in love with Merlin. And because Merlin had told him he was going, had told him why, more or less, had said good-bye with a smile and a wave and left a hole bigger than Arthur had ever expected. Gwen is easy to understand, in some ways, a marriage that broke, a woman he loved. Arthur has never been able to explain Merlin so simply. More than a servant. More than a friend, in some ways, in how it sometimes felt like he was the only one who knew Arthur, down to his essence. </p>\n<p>\u201cAnd?\u201d The sorcerer presses. He rarely does. </p>\n<p>\u201cAnd I have to go,\u201d Arthur says, and walks out. </p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>The sorcerer counters Arthur\u2019s stories of court, of his quests, of Gwaine\u2019s latest antics, with stories of his adventures. They are many and varied, take him into all the kingdoms of Albion. He has worked as a farmer in Mercia, as a shepherd in Escetia, as a fisherman in the lakes in Camelot\u2019s north, and can tell stories of the places with expansive gestures and surprising humor. </p>\n<p>He uses magic in the stories, of course. Its never important, just a casual mention that he slips in so easily that before long, Arthur has stopped noticing, stopped flinching. But he never hides it, either. He never hides anything, it seems, just narrates tales in a continuous stream of words that he can\u2019t stop to think about. </p>\n<p>Which is why it surprises Arthur when he cuts himself off halfway through one of his more exciting stories, including a garter snake, a caravan, three apples, and a group of bandits. </p>\n<p>\u201cAnd?\u201d Arthur prompts, \u201cAnd then the bandits attacked, and\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>The sorcerer presses his lips together, relaxes them. He stills, sobers. \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d His fist closes, opens, and there\u2019s a ball of fire on it, blue with heat. </p>\n<p>\u201cOh.\u201d Arthur forgets, sometimes, that just because the sorcerer isn\u2019t attacking him doesn\u2019t mean he can\u2019t. Doesn\u2019t mean he isn\u2019t still dangerous. More dangerous than Morgana, in some ways, he worries, because he is absolutely sane, and Morgana isn\u2019t anymore. Or so he hopes. </p>\n<p>\u201cI defended myself.\u201d Long fingers wrap around the fire, squeeze, and it winks out. \u201cJust like you would have.\u201d Shadows flicker over the sorcerer\u2019s face, turning it into sharp planes, staining his lips red. </p>\n<p>\u201cI would have used a sword.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s still a weapon. Still a tool.\u201d The sorcerer sounds tired, less like he\u2019s unconvinced and more like he\u2019s said it so often he doesn\u2019t think his words will do anything. </p>\n<p>\u201cNot one they can counter.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cA sword will kill me as dead as it would you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cApparently not,\u201d Arthur scowls. He hasn\u2019t actually tried to execute the sorcerer in weeks, but he regards it as a bit of a loss of pride that he hasn\u2019t been able to. </p>\n<p>The sorcerer, though, is serious as he responds. \u201cThere\u2019s a limit to everyone\u2019s power, Arthur, even mine. Once that\u2019s gone, I\u2019m as mortal as any man.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cBut you have that power,\u201d Arthur insists, though something curls inside him at the sorcerer\u2019s words, like ice. \u201cIt\u2019s\u2014it\u2019s unfair.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd what do you call your armies? Your knights? Your skill at arms?\u201d The sorcerer traces a design in the air, leaves a trail of sparks behind so that it twists into some complex rune. There\u2019s something in his tone that sounds like Merlin, quietly, seriously impudent. \u201cWe each have our power, Arthur. Is yours more \u2018fair\u2019 than mine?\u201d</p>\n<p>Arthur finds he cannot answer that. </p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Morgana attacks the next week. Or, in honesty, she attacks with the help of Alined and his armies, but Arthur knows his men can fight off the armies. They have the best army in Albion. But Morgana\u2014and the magic she wields\u2014worries him. They\u2019ve been curiously free from most magical attacks, the hippogriff not withstanding, for the last seven years or so, but he still cannot predict her strength, or how to fight her. </p>\n<p>\u201cYou defeated her before,\u201d the sorcerer points out when Arthur tries to discuss battle strategies with him. It doesn\u2019t work well; the man simply does not understand, or doesn\u2019t want to. \u201cWhat did you do that time?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not the same at all,\u201d Arthur snaps, \u201cShe had an undead army. And,\u201d he admits, \u201cI don\u2019t know. The men started dying. I think her magic broke, or malfunctioned. We can\u2019t count on that happening again.\u201d He hardly remembers that battle in some ways, only the swirl of betrayal, the breaking of the image of the girl who had sparred with him as children.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, you can\u2019t,\u201d the sorcerer agrees, sounding entirely too cheerful for someone who is in a castle facing imminent invasion. \u201cBut what else can you do? Otherwise, you\u2019d have to use magic.\u201d He blows a glittering cloud off his hand, lets it settle over Arthur. He rolls his eyes and shakes it off. God, he can be such a girl\u2014damn. No, he can\u2019t be thinking that, in that fond tone. That tone is Merlin\u2019s. Always. Completely. </p>\n<p>\u201cThat is the problem,\u201d he snaps. \u201cIf you can\u2019t help me\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d The sorcerer truly does sound sorry, and it softens Arthur, a little. He wasn\u2019t mad at the other man, anyway\u2014just at himself. The sorcerer is a sorcerer. He can\u2019t be grouped with Merlin, even if sometimes, if Arthur closed his eyes, he could almost imagine himself ten years ago, talking to Merlin in his chambers, back before Gwen and Uther\u2019s decline and everything else. \u201cBut I can\u2019t tell you how to prevent anything until I know what she can do.\u201d</p>\n<p>Arthur closes his eyes, breathes in and out. He came down here knowing that, though hoping otherwise. He hears Merlin in his head, talking to him of tolerance, of patience, of wanting a better world. \u201cYou could fight for us,\u201d he suggests, and studies the door jamb. </p>\n<p>A long, slow breath comes from the cell. \u201cWould I come back here afterwards, for doing magic?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019d let you go.\u201d It hurts, to say that. Not in the admitting the exception, the hypocrisy, because it isn\u2019t hypocrisy. Not because he\u2019d let a dangerous criminal go, because he can\u2019t quite convince himself that the sorcerer is dangerous. But because the sorcerer will go, and Arthur won\u2019t have this retreat anymore, this retreat to someone who talks to him not as a king, but as a man. </p>\n<p>\u201cBut magic will still be punishable by death.\u201d </p>\n<p>Arthur breathes out. \u201cYes.\u201d He can\u2019t change that. He doesn\u2019t even know if he should, given Morgana\u2019s invasion. If magic is let into the kingdom, what protection does he have against more Morgana\u2019s? All the sorcerers already hate him. </p>\n<p>Something rustles in the cell. \u201cI won\u2019t hide my magic, not anymore.\u201d Arthur looks up. The sorcerer is standing in the light at the mouth of the cell. The torch lights up his face, skews his proportions, so he looks taller and leaner, paler. He could almost be Merlin, in one of his sojourns in these cells, and Arthur coming to let him out with a roll of his eyes and quiet gratitude. Arthur doesn\u2019t know why he\u2019s been thinking about Merlin so much, lately. He\u2019s just missing him more, he guesses. He\u2019d forgotten what it was like to laugh, and to argue. \u201cI can\u2019t. I\u2019ll save my own life, but no more.\u201d </p>\n<p>It\u2019s nothing Arthur doesn\u2019t expect. \u201cFine. If you won\u2019t fight, we\u2019ll have to muddle through on our own.\u201d He spins on his heel, stalks towards the door. He doesn\u2019t turn around when the sorcerer calls out his name. </p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Morgana will attack at dawn. She has moved quickly through the countryside, quickly enough that Arthur suspects magic at work. He doesn\u2019t know, of course. Her army is smaller than his, and his has walls and towers and the full protection of Camelot. But she knows the country, knows Camelot, for all his changes; and she has magic. </p>\n<p>Arthur paces his room. He\u2019s alone, of course; George went to bed hours ago. He always gets all this energy before a battle, the nerves that aren\u2019t nervous, just keyed up. Merlin used to stay up with him, babble at him until he calmed down, play games or just sit in pensive quiet, whatever Arthur needed without Arthur asking. Gwen used to help him work off his energy in other ways. But now\u2014his knights are off doing what they need, for their own battle. He needs\u2014he can\u2019t be alone. </p>\n<p>He pivots, stalks down the stone stairs. Everyone else is asleep. Camelot is asleep, waiting for the storm to break. He crosses the courtyard, stares up at the towering walls. His walls. His place. His love. Gwen must have understood that, once. That he loved her, but he loves Camelot with everything he is, everything he has. Merlin knew that, had told him that. Told him he would become this. </p>\n<p>He is in the dungeons before he can remember getting there. The sorcerer is sitting on the pallet, legs folded, staring at the fire dragon curled in his lap. When Arthur bursts in, the door slamming open, he bolts to his feet. The dragon screeches. Arthur stares. </p>\n<p>\u201cAfraid?\u201d he barks. He starts to pace the small area of the room that isn\u2019t the cell. </p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d the sorcerer shoots back, folding his legs back under him. Then he subsides. \u201cJust\u2014can\u2019t you feel it? The waiting?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAlways,\u201d Arthur says. The anger has drained out of him, until all he has left is energy. \u201cI can\u2019t sleep. It\u2019s coming. She can\u2019t take Camelot, she can\u2019t. I\u2019ve seen what she\u2019ll do with it. I won\u2019t let that happen.\u201d He growls it through gritted teeth, a vow and a threat. \u201cI\u2019ll die first.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cYou won\u2019t,\u201d the sorcerer says, with that same odd surety he has sometimes, like absolute faith. Merlin had that too, the same total devotion. Total loyalty. \u201cShe is not your destiny.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cGreat. Destiny. Will that win a battle?\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d the sorcerer chuckles, leans forward and covers his face with his hands, and keeps on chuckling. \u201cGods, no, it won\u2019t.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cExactly. You know what will? You.\u201d </p>\n<p>The sorcerer lifts his head. His eyes are a deep, rich blue in the light from his dragon. \u201cArthur, I told you\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re a bloody sorcerer!\u201d Arthur yells. It echoes off the stone walls. \u201cViolence is what you do. Just cast your spells and keep Camelot safe.\u201d </p>\n<p>The sorcerer rises, slowly, dragging darkness behind him like a cloak. Arthur hasn\u2019t remembered that he\u2019s dangerous for a long time. \u201cSire,\u201d he says, dripping dignity. The dragon dissolves in a flash of sparks. \u201cIf that is all you think of me, then why should I not fight for Morgana?\u201d</p>\n<p>Arthur steps back, wishing he brought his sword. It\u2019s not much defense, but it is some. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you? Not helping us is the same thing.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, Arthur.\u201d The sorcerer paces forward, until he stands at the bars and glares out. \u201cIt\u2019s not. That\u2019s what Uther never understood. Sorcery isn\u2019t violence. Men are violence.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re a man!\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cBut not a violent one.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019ve killed before.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you think that makes me happy?\u201d The sorcerer reaches up to grab the bars, braces himself against them. \u201cDo you think I\u2019m proud of that? I\u2019ve done what I had to do. And that\u2019s what I\u2019ll do now.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cGreat. Just great.\u201d Arthur whirls around, paces the other way. \u201cMerlin, he did what he had to do. Just a peasant boy. But he saved my life more time than I can count. He went into battle with me, with only the barest of training. Hell, he invaded Camelot with me!\u201d Arthur reaches the other end, feels the cold stone against his forehead. \u201cI wish he was here now.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cWhy?\u201d the sorcerer sounds curious, now, less angry. </p>\n<p>\u201cBecause he was the bravest man I knew,\u201d Arthur tells the wall. \u201cI could be brave for him.\u201d He lets the cool of the stone sink into him. \u201cIf I live, I\u2019ll see you after the battle.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cArthur\u2014\u201d Arthur turns back. The sorcerer\u2019s eyes are golden in the night. He swallows, bites something down. \u201cGood luck.\u201d</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>It goes as Arthur expects, which means Camelot is losing. The enemy can\u2019t breach the walls, but they\u2019re coming far closer than anyone is comfortable with, and they\u2019re losing men far too fast. Morgana is clearly visible, riding back and forth among the troops, throwing bolts of something at the walls that makes them creak and writhe, though as of yet, miraculously, they\u2019re holding. When dusk comes, Camelot still stands. </p>\n<p>\u201cWe aren\u2019t provisioned for a long siege,\u201d Leon says, striking the report of grain supplies. The metal rings against the wood. \u201cAnd who knows what Morgana would do to the countryside in the meantime.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cThen we take the battle to her,\u201d Gwaine suggests. His usually shiny hair is matted with sweat and blood, but his grin is still bright and fearless. \u201cDrive them away.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDid you see what happens when those\u2014things hit the walls?\u201d Elyan counters, \u201cI don\u2019t want to face those on the field.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cShe\u2019s key,\u201d Percival breaks in, slow and thoughtful, \u201cIf we can disable her\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHow, if we don\u2019t have magic?\u201d Gwaine points out. \u201cArthur, have you talked to\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s not going to help.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDamn.\u201d All five of them study the papers on the table, the sketches of the battlefield, records of supplies, scout\u2019s reports. The situation isn\u2019t hopeless, not as bad as they have been\u2014but it\u2019s bad. </p>\n<p>\u201cWhat if,\u201d Leon begins, but the doors burst open before he can finish his thought. They hit the walls with a bang, and fall silent. </p>\n<p>Morgana stands in the center of the open doors. Arthur hasn\u2019t seen her this closely in years; a part of him registers that she has come a long way since the lady worshiped by all the knights of Camelot. She is beautiful still, always, but her dress hangs off her body like she has lost weight, and her eyes are huge and crazed in a pale face. \u201cOh, boys,\u201d she drawls. She paces forward, and a score of men pace in behind her. The knights press together in the center of the room, back to back. How did she get in? \u201cWere you talking about me?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy are you here, Morgana?\u201d Arthur says evenly. If one of them gets out, sounds the alarm\u2026</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy brother dearest,\u201d she throws up her hands, so a blast of fire shoots towards the ceiling. \u201cI\u2019m only here to take what is rightfully mine.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cArthur is the rightful king of Camelot.\u201d Arthur has never loved Leon so much as then, as he faces down Morgana with cool eyes and steady resolve. </p>\n<p>\u201cOf course you\u2019d say so,\u201d she snaps. \u201cBut my men here think otherwise, don\u2019t you boys?\u201d The men don\u2019t answer, but they spread out around the room. \u201cAnd I\u2019m afraid that once Arthur is dead, it won\u2019t matter much anyway.\u201d</p>\n<p>The room bursts into action. The knights close around Arthur, Morgana\u2019s men charge forward, and she laughs, high and loud. </p>\n<p>It\u2019s a hopeless fight, and they all know it. Five men, though they are the best of Camelot, against a score or more plus a sorceress of unknowable power; there is nothing for it. They can only hope to survive, to get Arthur out, to do damage before they die. Gwaine laughs as he slashes, a blur of red cloak and silver mail and dark hair; on Arthur\u2019s other side Leon is steady and methodical, textbook perfect as he slices down men. Percival shoves Arthur aside so that another fire blast hits the hanging behind him and sets it alight; Elyan cries out and then mutters \u201cthanks.\u201d The fire spreads to the music of swords and Morgana\u2019s laughter, pens them in even more, so that they can hardly breathe, and Arthur spares a moment as he slashes desperately at an oncoming sword, hacking out a breath, to wish Merlin a long, happy life, away from the death he would have earned here, to wish Gwen happy, to hope Lancelot takes care of her. The fire licks at the round table, Morgana shrieks her victory\u2014</p>\n<p>And then the fire stops, shifts, and then it is a dragon\u2019s cry that rings out, and the fire is a dragon that swoops around Camelot\u2019s knights, driving back their enemies, and glides to the door, where it twines around the sorcerer before disappearing. </p>\n<p>How did he get out? Arthur barely wonders it before he dismisses that in favor of the more pressing question. Why did he get out? </p>\n<p>\u201cMorgana,\u201d the sorcerer says, quietly, calmly. </p>\n<p>Morgana shakes her head and yells out a word, fire flashes towards the sorcerer. He waves a hand and it vanishes. </p>\n<p>Morgana takes a step back. \u201cWho are you?\u201d she demands, and she almost sounds frightened. </p>\n<p>\u201cYou will not kill these men,\u201d the sorcerer replies. He paces forward.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy not? I am High Priestess of the Old Religion,\u201d she declares, and tosses back her hair, and for an instant Arthur sees the girl who had bullied her way into sword practice in the midst of his fear for the sorcerer. \u201cYou have magic, you owe your fealty to me.\u201d She tries to throw a gust of wind this time; once more the sorcerer dismisses it. </p>\n<p>\u201cI owe fealty to no one but Arthur,\u201d the sorcerer says, tall and sure, and something sets fire in Arthur, pride or simple astonishment. \u201cI am Emrys, and I say you will not touch him.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cEmrys?\u201d Morgana\u2019s eyes widen, and she reels back. \u201cEmrys? You? But\u2014No!\u201d She yells, and the men attack again. </p>\n<p>The sorcerer speaks a long, rolling word, and lightning crashes outside, the windows crashing into pieces. The lightning streaks in, cuts down half the men before it flashes out. Another flash, the others are down, and the knights turn towards Morgana. She screams her fury and throws her hands towards the sorcerer, and a whirlwind starts, pulls the papers into it; then the chairs start to groan and break as the whirlwind grows. Percival reaches out to grab a pillar with one hand and Gwaine\u2019s collar with the other as the wind pulls them in; Leon snatches at Arthur and Elyan and yanks them back before they stumble into the dervish that has already picked up dead men\u2019s swords. </p>\n<p>The sorcerer\u2019s eyes widen, and he reaches out his hands in a mirror image of Morgana. His eyes flash golden; the whirlwind stops moving. For a long, long moment, the whirlwind is still, and they face each other across the room. Then, inch by inch, the whirlwind moves towards Morgana. Sweat is dancing across her forehead, his muscles are clenched, but it moves, until it is next to her, until it picks her up and spits her out so that she hits a wall with a sickening crunch. </p>\n<p>The sorcerer rolls back his shoulders, looks at the still raging whirlwind. He speaks another word, his eyes flash, and the wind is gone, and he sags. </p>\n<p>Arthur gets to his feet. Morgana is down, dead or unconscious but certainly defeated. \u201cTake her and the men to the dungeons,\u201d he orders Leon, then to Elyan, \u201cFind out how she got in,\u201d and to Percival, \u201cFind the rest of the men.\u201d The men scatter, move around the sorcerer in a wide berth.</p>\n<p>Arthur approaches him cautiously, one hand on his sword. \u201cI thought you weren\u2019t going to fight.\u201d</p>\n<p>The sorcerer looks up from where he was considering Leon picking up Morgana. His eyes fade from golden into blue, and his grin is wide and open. \u201cI also said you weren\u2019t going to die.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell\u2014\u201d Arthur decides it\u2019s not worth it to argue about if he would have lived. Only Merlin would have argued with him after a battle. \u201cWhy did you fight?\u201d</p>\n<p>The sorcerer breathes in and out. He is just Merlin\u2019s height, Arthur notices inconsequentially, a few inches taller than Arthur himself. \u201cI said I\u2019d fight to save myself,\u201d he says, slowly. \u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>Gwaine is moving even before the sword is finished piercing into the sorcerer\u2019s side, and the man who struck the blow falls dead for real even as Arthur grabs at the sorcerer as he falls. \u201cGet Gaius,\u201d Arthur snaps out, and there are pounding feet. The sorcerer\u2019s eyes are gold, and there isn\u2019t enough blood coming out, he must be somehow healing it, but he\u2019s getting pale fast. Arthur grabs for something to make a bandage out of, comes up with nothing but his bloody surcoat, which is better than nothing. He rips off a piece, folds it, presses it against the wound. \u201cYou can\u2019t die,\u201d Arthur mutters, nonsense words. He hasn\u2019t felt this helpless since his father died, since he watched Merlin collapse after drinking poison meant for him. He can\u2019t watch another person die for him. He can\u2019t have more holes in his heart. \u201cI\u2019m supposed to kill you, eventually. I already tried a sword. That can\u2019t work.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cNot\u2014about\u2014the weapon\u2014\u201d the sorcerer\u2014Emrys, he called himself\u2014gasps out. His hair looks nearly black against the pallor of his skin. \u201cShould\u2014have\u2014figured\u2014that\u2014out\u2014already\u2014you\u2014clotpole.\u201d</p>\n<p>Arthur nearly drops him. That\u2019s Merlin\u2019s word, his and Merlin\u2019s word, just like he is Merlin\u2019s height, and his hair is black and his eyes are blue and he knew those hands and that smile and that faith. </p>\n<p>Then Gaius is there, at the sorcerer\u2019s\u2014at Merlin\u2019s\u2014side, and he is easing him away from Arthur as Arthur stands frozen, and Merlin smiles. \u201cTold you you\u2019d miss me,\u201d he mutters as his eyes flutter closed into unconsciousness.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Arthur spends the next week supervising recovery from the attack. It takes a lot of time and effort, and he even helps rebuild a home or two, and it is important and necessary work. And it means he has very little time to think about Merlin, recovering in Gaius\u2019s chambers. Merlin, who he hadn\u2019t recognized. Merlin, who was a sorcerer. Merlin, who came back to him. </p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s recovering well.\u201d Arthur looks up from his desk to see Gwaine in the doorway, watching him. His dark eyes are almost sober, for once. </p>\n<p>\u201cHm?\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cMerlin.\u201d Gwaine moves into the room with his usual insolent swagger. There is something more in his gaze, though, something Arthur remembers from the first few times they met, when Gwaine followed him for Merlin\u2019s sake, and thought Arthur no better than his father or any other noble. Merlin always could inspire loyalty. He had won Arthur\u2019s, once. \u201cHe\u2019s going to make a full recovery. Just thought you might like to know.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh. Thank you.\u201d Arthur lets out a breath he didn\u2019t know he was holding, feels tension slide off his shoulders. Not that he knows what he feels about this news. In some ways, it would be easier if he\u2014no. He can\u2019t wish Merlin dead, even if he is a sorcerer. But was Gwaine spending much time with Merlin? He had been around the rebuilding, helping and charming the girls in equal measure, but he must have stolen time to check. Clearly there was no bitterness there. \u201cAnything else?\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cNo. Just thought you might be interested in the fate of the man who nearly died for you. Again.\u201d Gwaine lets out a humorless chuckle and turns to go. His cloak swirls judgmentally around him, and really, how does he manage that? He can\u2019t judge Arthur. He didn\u2019t talk to Merlin-as-the sorcerer like Arthur did. He didn\u2019t know Merlin like Arthur did. </p>\n<p>He did know Merlin, though, had been his friend, had missed him when he left, had taken his place as the insolent one in Arthur\u2019s court, so Arthur stops him before he can leave. \u201cGwaine.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah?\u201d It\u2019s surly, disrespectful, but he stops. </p>\n<p>\u201cDid you know?\u201d Arthur\u2019s not sure what answer he wants. If Gwaine knew, then he can be insulted, but it\u2019s an explanation for why Gwaine isn\u2019t angry. If Gwaine didn\u2019t know\u2014how did Gwaine swallow the abandonment? And how many secrets had Merlin carried alone, without Arthur\u2019s help to hold him up? </p>\n<p>\u201cThat he had magic, or that he was the sorcerer?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cEither. Both.\u201d All those secrets. All those things Arthur hadn\u2019t known. All those parts of a man Arthur had thought he knew inside and out. </p>\n<p>\u201cNo.\u201d Gwaine twitches his head thoughtfully. \u201cI suspected about the magic, though. Was clear he had a secret, right? Always disappearing at the right moments.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re not angry?\u201d Angry, hurt, betrayed, overjoyed, all of the emotions swirling together in Arthur so it feels like he\u2019s about to explode. </p>\n<p>\u201cNope.\u201d Gwaine pauses, thinks. \u201cWell, a bit that he didn\u2019t tell me he was the sorcerer in case he needed help. But not really.\u201d </p>\n<p>Arthur shakes his head. He can\u2019t understand that. Can\u2019t understand how everyone isn\u2019t reeling. </p>\n<p>Gwaine\u2019s cloak moves thoughtfully around his ankles. \u201cWant my advice, Sire?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo.\u201d He doesn\u2019t need Gwaine\u2019s advice. Gwaine may be the only person in the castle who understands emotions less than him. </p>\n<p>\u201cGo see him.\u201d Gwaine hesitates, then puts a hand on Arthur\u2019s shoulder. \u201cI was his friend, yeah, but you two were something else. And he\u2019d like to see you. Always asks about you.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cProbably wants to make sure I won\u2019t have him killed,\u201d Arthur mutters, and shakes off Gwaine\u2019s hand. </p>\n<p>Gwaine takes a step back. \u201cTried that, didn\u2019t you? How\u2019d it work for you?\u201d</p>\n<p>As Arthur doesn\u2019t have a retort to that, and shouldn\u2019t really be bandying words with one of his knights, he sits back down at his desk. \u201cI\u2019ll see if I can find time to see him.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhatever you say, Sire.\u201d Gwaine leaves. His cloak blows dramatically in the wind. </p>\n<p>It takes Arthur a second to realize there isn\u2019t any wind in the castle. </p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Merlin is asleep in the room off of Gaius\u2019s chambers when Arthur comes in. It\u2019s almost like no time has passed, like Arthur has just come in to wake his lazy servant (who was never really lazy, Arthur always knew) with a bucket of water and laughter when Merlin would come upright, sputtering profanity. </p>\n<p>But there are differences, too. The Merlin who came back is not the Merlin who left. His shoulders are broader than they were before. His hair is still a mess, but its longer, more unkempt. He has been in a dungeon for the past two months, Arthur supposes, though not charitably. And he\u2019s paler than he was. Arthur moves forward, towards the bed. His cheekbones have always been ridiculous, but now they jut out from his face like a weapon, like Merlin hasn\u2019t eaten enough in weeks. Merlin\u2019s always been skinny, but this is\u2014the prisoners are fed, Arthur knows that. This is the sort of weight loss that comes with years of not eating enough.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhere have you been?\u201d Arthur asks quietly, sitting down on the chair next to the bed. He doesn\u2019t want to wake Merlin. He\u2019s not sure why. He is the king, he\u2019s busy, he has things to do\u2014but he sits, watches Merlin sleep. </p>\n<p>Merlin tosses in his bed, rolls over onto his side so he faces Arthur. His eyes are still closed, lashes dark against the pallor of his cheeks. His chapped lips are parted, just the tiniest bit. The motion makes the blankets fall down; with an exasperated snort Arthur leans over to pull them back up to his chin. </p>\n<p>\u201cArthur,\u201d Merlin says, lips moving softly. Arthur freezes, one hand on either side of Merlin. His eyes are still closed; Arthur has a sudden thought of what might make him breathe his name that sends warmth rushing through him. Then again, louder, worried and frantic. \u201cArthur!\u201d His eyes spring open, Arthur leaps backwards, way from him, away from the proof that he bothered to care about him. Merlin\u2019s eyes rove the room, then light on him, and the relief in them is tangible. \u201cNot yet,\u201d he breathes out, and relaxes back down into the blankets. \u201cNot yet, not yet, not yet,\u201d like a mantra. </p>\n<p>\u201cStill talking about me in your sleep?\u201d Arthur drawls. He knows nightmares when he sees them. He remembers Morgana, bolting upright in her bed, remembers talking her back into the present. He\u2019s wondered, sometimes, if he might have changed something if he had done that more. If he had seen more in the days she was sharper with lack of sleep and he had laughed her off with bravado and fear of showing care. </p>\n<p>Of course, Merlin might already be evil\u2014no. Arthur can\u2019t even really think that. Merlin is a sorcerer. Merlin isn\u2019t evil. Arthur knows that like he knows his name, like he knows the sky is blue. Like he knows the color of Merlin\u2019s eyes. </p>\n<p>\u201cNightmares,\u201d Merlin retorts. He eases himself up onto one elbow, so he can look Arthur in the face. His lips twist into an ironic, teasing smile. That smile, not quite the same but close enough to the one with which he used to greet him, sends another wave of heat through him. \u201cNice of you to grace my bedside with your presence, Sire.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve been busy.\u201d It sounds much less justified out loud, with Merlin smiling at him like that, like he knows exactly what that means. </p>\n<p>But Merlin still sobers, and his eyes are worried when he asks, \u201cWas there much damage?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNot as much as there could have been. In a way, Morgana\u2019s assassination attack worked for us. It kept the fight contained.\u201d Arthur leans back against the wall. It\u2019s almost like old times, talking over their days in the quiet of a room. </p>\n<p>\u201cDidn\u2019t work for me,\u201d Merlin mutters.</p>\n<p>Arthur rolls his eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s a flesh wound, Merlin. You\u2019re fine. Stop whining.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt was a gut wound, and the only reason I\u2019m not dead right now is because I had to let go of the wards around the kingdom to hold myself together,\u201d Merlin shoots back. Arthur\u2019s eyebrows rise to hide the fear. Merlin seemed more or less fine now. He lets his eyes drift down, over Merlin\u2019s chest and stomach, to survey what damage there might have been. He can\u2019t see any, but he keeps looking. \u201cYou might want to send out more patrols, by the way.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWards?\u201d Arthur asks. It\u2019s the easiest thing for him to deal with. </p>\n<p>\u201cWhat, did you think I was going to leave you unprotected?\u201d Merlin scoffs. \u201cI knew you were an idiot, but really?\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cI didn\u2019t even know you were bothering to think about us back here.\u201d Arthur thinks, decides to amend it. \u201cI mean, I didn\u2019t know you were protecting us.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course I was.\u201d Merlin wiggles, scoots backwards, so he is sitting up in bed, the blankets around his hips. His whole torso is swathed in bandages, but they\u2019re all white, so the bleeding must have stopped. \u201cWhy do you think you\u2019re still alive?\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cThe fact that I\u2019m the best knight in the land?\u201d Arthur suggests. Then he glares, because he still does know Merlin. \u201cAnd if you say I\u2019m not, I will have you executed.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cThat hasn\u2019t worked so well for you.\u201d It\u2019s only then that Arthur really remembers why he came here. It wasn\u2019t to talk about old times. It wasn\u2019t to fall too easily back into a pattern of relying on Merlin. Merlin, who went away. Merlin, who out of all those who left had come back. </p>\n<p>Merlin must read something of that on his face, because his falls. \u201cSo we\u2019re doing this now?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo.\u201d Arthur rises. He can\u2019t deal with it right now, with Merlin weak and pale in bed, with him still trying to wrap his mind around Merlin. \u201cSleep, now.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGet better, Merlin.\u201d It\u2019s not a suggestion. Arthur leaves with Merlin staring after him, and can almost feel the gaze the rest of the day. </p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>When Arthur next finds the time to visit Merlin\u2014not that he\u2019s been avoiding Merlin, at all, no matter what Gwaine\u2019s cloak seems to imply\u2014he\u2019s sitting up in bed. He\u2019s still thin, too thin, but his color is better. The fire dragon is doing loop-de-loops in front of the bed. When Merlin sees Arthur, the dragon screeches, high-pitched but fairly accurate, from Arthur\u2019s admittedly limited experience with dragons, and swoops around Arthur\u2019s head before it curls around Merlin\u2019s neck. Like a neckerchief, Arthur realizes. He wonders why he didn\u2019t realize that before. </p>\n<p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t I recognize you?\u201d Arthur asks as he takes a seat. It\u2019s not the most important question, not even nearly, but it\u2019s something. A small truth. </p>\n<p>\u201cAn illusion. Well, it was more of a glamour.\u201d Merlin runs a finger along the dragon\u2019s crest. The flames encircle his finger, twine around it, but it doesn\u2019t seem to hurt. \u201cSort of a mental nudge. I learned it from a half-Sidhe herbswoman in Mercia. It was an omni-directional influence that redirected all thoughts pertaining to\u2014\u201d Merlin is almost smiling, and his face is alight, his hands waving around just like he used to when describing something Gaius had taught him. Arthur had forgotten how enthusiastic he got about things, how excited he got about the smallest things. He\u2019s almost attractive like that.</p>\n<p>Arthur still feels the need to cut him off. \u201cIn English, please.\u201d </p>\n<p>Merlin pauses, his hands still waving in the air. Then they drop, and he rolls his eyes. \u201cWhenever your brain\u2014what there is of it\u2014recognized anything about me, the spell sort of pushed your thoughts in a different direction. So if you thought you, say, knew my laugh, then the instant you thought that you\u2019d sort of overlook that you\u2019d ever thought it, see?\u201d</p>\n<p>This is why Arthur doesn\u2019t like magic. It\u2019s like the science Gaius used to try to force him to learn. It goes in twisty direction, is essentially not straightforward the way a good sword is. Arthur can think like that, no way of doing diplomacy otherwise, but he doesn\u2019t like to. \u201cNo.\u201d</p>\n<p>Merlin lets out an irritated huff. \u201cIt was an illusion.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Arthur can understand that, he supposes. \u201cAnd you decided to disguise yourself and come back as a criminal instead of returning honestly, as yourself, because\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>Merlin sighs. \u201cBecause I\u2019m a coward.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTry again.\u201d Merlin is a lot of things, a liar being one of them, but Arthur will never believe he\u2019s a coward. Even if he has magic, he\u2019s still done stupidly brave things over and over again, usually to save Arthur\u2019s life. Maybe more, now that Arthur considers all the convenient circumstances that saved his life when Merlin was around. </p>\n<p>\u201cBecause I\u2019m not going to hide anymore.\u201d The dragon rustles at Merlin\u2019s throat. Merlin runs a hand over its head, and it dissolves. Merlin\u2019s neck looks oddly bare without anything on it. There\u2019s a little dip in his skin, just below his collarbone, just the right size for Arthur\u2019s thumb. \u201cI won\u2019t. I knew that when I came back. I had to be here, obviously, in case anything happened, but\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t going to hide by pretending to be someone else?\u201d Arthur demands. \u201cAnd what did you call yourself, anyway?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWill.\u201d Merlin\u2019s simple answer takes the breath out of Arthur. Because he remembers what he said, remembers standing in front of a pyre and watching Merlin hold back tears and not knowing what to say, how to make him better. He remembers wondering if\u2014hoping that\u2014Merlin would look like that if he died. \u201cThe spell probably stopped you from remembering it.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cSo you decide to disguise yourself as Will the Sorcerer because you won\u2019t hide who you are? You decided to lie some more, because there hasn\u2019t been enough of that around here already?\u201d More lies. Morgana, Uther, Gwen. Now Merlin. Everyone he loves, it seems, those are the ones who lie the most. Not that he loves Merlin. </p>\n<p>The breath rattles in and out of Merlin\u2019s chest. Then he raises his hand and blows out a breath of sparks, which change color and dance in the air in front of him until they disappear. Arthur watches, unimpressed. \u201cVery pretty. Answer my question,\u201d he demands.</p>\n<p>Merlin makes a sound that is almost laughter. \u201cI just did.\u201d </p>\n<p>Arthur glares, then leaves without another word. Bloody sorcerers. </p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>It nags at him, though. Merlin always had a way of talking that was a bit like sorcerers, now that he thinks about it, sideways and enigmatic and as if the simple things he said had depths of meaning behind them. It had amused and annoyed Arthur in equal measures\u2014and, though he would never have admitted it, intrigued and helped him, because Merlin could be astonishingly wise sometimes, once Arthur had deciphered what he said. This feels like one of those times. But Arthur\u2014he\u2019s got nothing. </p>\n<p>\u201cOkay, I give up,\u201d he announces as he drops onto the edge of Merlin\u2019s bed. Now that Merlin\u2019s recovering, the chair has disappeared, so the bed is the only place to sit. </p>\n<p>Merlin slowly closes the book he\u2019s leafing through. He must be about ready to get up, by now; he\u2019s moving easily, and only occasionally winces when he twists. He does wince, however, when Arthur snags the book out of Merlin\u2019s hands and glances at the cover. He doesn\u2019t even recognize the writing, let alone the words. \u201cWhat is this?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cA spellbook,\u201d Merlin replies. Of course. Arthur opens it, flips through a few pages of unreadable script, then drops it on the floor. Maybe you need magic to read it. </p>\n<p>\u201cSo what did you mean?\u201d Arthur asks. His cheerfulness is surprising even himself, given that he\u2019s been in a bad enough mood for the past few days that even Leon snapped at him. But Morgana is imprisoned, and despite the fact that apparently Merlin just stepped out of the prison without a problem Gaius assured Arthur that Merlin had prepared for this, and she wouldn\u2019t be getting out. The kingdom is at peace. And Merlin is back,. Everything is more right with the world than it has been, even with the lies and slow-burning hurt. \u201cWith the \u2018I just did\u2019 thing.\u201d</p>\n<p>Merlin closes his eyes, in the expression that Arthur had always used to interpret as a plea for patience. Then he opens them again and his eyes flash gold, so bright that it almost takes Arthur\u2019s breath away, and it begins to snow. Arthur waits with commendable patience as the snow builds up on his shoulders, but by the time an inch has fallen he reaches over to cuff Merlin lightly on the shoulder. \u201cMerlin. Answer the question.\u201d </p>\n<p>Merlin\u2019s eyes flash again, and the snow stops. \u201cI just did magic.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cYes, thank you, I noticed. The indoor snow rather gave it away.\u201d Arthur reaches over to brush the snow off of Merlin\u2019s head, because it can\u2019t be healthy to get a chill so soon after being stabbed through. Merlin\u2019s hair is soft against his fingers. The cold made Merlin\u2019s cheeks flush even more; a few flakes of snow caught in his eyelashes. Arthur moves back, away from the odd twist in his stomach, and only then does Merlin reply. </p>\n<p>\u201cI did magic. And did you care?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNot really.\u201d Arthur shrugs. \u201cI mean, it was just a trick, right? It\u2019s no more than you\u2019ve been doing for months\u2014\u201d then he hears himself. \u201cOh. Well. I\u2019m used to it, I guess.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cExactly.\u201d Merlin pushes his hair back with one hand. \u201cI\u2019ve had a lot of time to think about it. I figured you needed to see magic that wasn\u2019t trying to kill you.\u201d He tries a smile; it\u2019s a weak, pitiful thing, but hopeful. It\u2019s the same sort of smile he would use when informing Arthur that no, the stables weren\u2019t cleaned out, because you kept me up all night winning all your pocket change at dice. Those were good nights, just him and Merlin in the warmth and darkness of his room, their heads bent together over the table, close enough that Arthur remembers the feeling of knowing he was near more than the sight itself. </p>\n<p>That memory hurts, because that had been true, hadn\u2019t it? \u201cAnd you couldn\u2019t have done that as yourself?\u201d Arthur snaps. </p>\n<p>\u201cNo!\u201d Merlin snaps back. The smile dies a quick death. </p>\n<p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t have\u2014I wouldn\u2019t have tried to execute you if I had known who you were,\u201d Arthur retorts. It\u2019s true. He thinks. No, it is. He wouldn\u2019t have executed Merlin. He\u2019s not sure what he would have done, how he would have reacted, but he\u2019s not sure there was anything Merlin could have done that would have made Arthur execute him. Maybe kill the king. Maybe. Arthur would have been willing to listen to his reasons; he probably would have had good ones. He hadn\u2019t managed to execute Gwen or Lancelot, had he?</p>\n<p>\u201cI know.\u201d Merlin sounds weary, the sort of weariness that goes soul-deep, that pierces Arthur below the anger and makes him want to drive it away. \u201cI know, Arthur.\u201d He reaches out, so that his hand rests over Arthur\u2019s. Arthur looks down at their touching hands. His skin is warm and rough, calloused in the way that only hard work can do. He didn\u2019t do everything with magic. \u201cThat\u2019s why I couldn\u2019t. I didn\u2019t want to be an exception.\u201d He might sound tired, but his eyes are incredibly earnest. \u201cI didn\u2019t tell you any lies, Arthur. Not in that cell. If magic remains outlawed, I will stay in that cell the rest of my life.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cMerlin\u2026\u201d Arthur doesn\u2019t know what to say. He can\u2019t just go around allowing magic. It\u2019s not how things are done. No one would agree. How would the courts deal with it? Regulate it? </p>\n<p>Merlin pulls his hand back, way from Arthur. He hadn\u2019t noticed how warm Merlin\u2019s hands had been until they were gone. \u201cYou\u2019ll do the right thing, Arthur. But until then, I\u2019m still just a sorcerer you have imprisoned.\u201d </p>\n<p>Arthur can tell when he\u2019s dismissed. He goes.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Merlin is clearly not a threat. He\u2019s not competent enough to be one, in the first place, and in the second\u2014well, he just isn\u2019t. Anyone with half a brain could see that. But he is powerful, apparently, according to Gaius and what Arthur has seen. And he knows a lot. Maybe\u2026</p>\n<p>\u201cSo what do you think about magic?\u201d He\u2019s gathered the knights\u2014his knights, the five of them\u2014into his chambers for a smaller meeting. These aren\u2019t the men he would have to convince, but he won\u2019t do it without them. </p>\n<p>The men look around at each other. It is, to Arthur\u2019s surprise, Percival who answers first. \u201cMagic is just another strength,\u201d he says. \u201cI do not believe there must be evil in it.\u201d They seem to understand his real question. Good men, all of them. </p>\n<p>\u201cBut look at all the magical threats we\u2019ve faced,\u201d Elyan counters. </p>\n<p>\u201cLook at all the non-magical ones,\u201d Gwaine puts in. He leans back, kicks his feet up onto the table. \u201cI say anything that helps us in a fight is good.\u201d </p>\n<p>Those two are the easy ones. Neither grew up in Camelot; neither have ever had the beliefs the rest of them have lived with, have been told were true since they were children. </p>\n<p>Elyan glances at Gwaine, at Arthur. His eyes skirt over to the corner where Merlin used to stand. \u201cI\u2019m not saying its all bad. But it\u2019s not all good, either, and that worries me.\u201d </p>\n<p>That\u2019s fair. That\u2019s true. Arthur nods at Elyan, and turns to Leon. </p>\n<p>Leon is studying the hilt of his sword. \u201cI saw what the discovery of her magic did to Morgana,\u201d he says, slowly, thoughtfully. \u201cI saw her suffer, though I did not know why.\u201d He looks up, then, and his eyes are as fierce as they were when he first swore his sword to Arthur, in the ruined castle all those years ago. \u201cThat must not happen again.\u201d </p>\n<p>Gwaine claps. Percival grunts his approval. Even Elyan shrugs. </p>\n<p>\u201cGood.\u201d Arthur leans forward, Thinks of Morgana shooting lightning and laughing as it struck men down. Thinks of Merlin in that cell, playing with his fire creatures for the rest of his life. Thinks of Merlin with his golden eyes, brighter than the sun. \u201cThen you\u2019re all with me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAlways,\u201d Elyan swears, and the others echo it. Then they get down to planning. </p>\n<p>After, when the knights scatter to their various duties, Gwaine lingers. \u201cNot that you\u2019re not doing a good thing,\u201d he says. The swirl of his cloak is oddly hesitant as he hovers in the doorway. \u201cBut how much of this is about Merlin?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDoes it matter?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNot really, no.\u201d Gwaine puts a hand on the doorjamb. \u201cBut you might want to figure that out.\u201d He leaves with a self-satisfied swish of his cloak. </p>\n<p>It\u2019s not all about Merlin. He had made some good points, in that cell, about tools and threats and power. Arthur cannot say he rules over a just kingdom where men are persecuted. </p>\n<p>Most of it is about Merlin. Merlin is not meant for the cells. Merlin is meant to be with Arthur. </p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Arthur doesn\u2019t sleep much for the next week. He spends most of his time talking with councilors, ministers, representatives of everything and everyone. He talks to Geoffrey to look at old precedents, to Gaius about the magic itself, even to Merlin about safeguards. He sleeps in clumps of a few hours each, spends that time tossing and turning and dreaming of Merlin bleeding to death in front of him. He negotiates for hours and hours until he more than half considers just going down to the dungeons to let Morgana take his head off. </p>\n<p>At the end of the week, magic is no longer punishable by death, and Arthur drops into his bed, fairly certain he\u2019s going to sleep for a year. </p>\n<p>\u201cRise and shine!\u201d Arthur groans, and buries his head under the pillows. Then the pillows are yanked back. Without opening his eyes, he grabs for them. His fingers close around something that feels like fabric, and he pulls. </p>\n<p>The pillow makes an odd squeaky noise. He opens his eyes to find Merlin\u2014whose shirt was apparently the \u2018pillow\u2019\u2014lying almost on top of him. His eyes are dancing, and his lips are pressed together as he tries not to laugh and very very red.</p>\n<p>\u201cMerlin!\u201d Arthur lets him go, scrambles back to the other side of his bed. He\u2019s not even sure why he\u2019s so embarrassed, but he thinks he might have dreamed about Merlin again last night. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m not a prisoner anymore, so I thought I\u2019d drop by for old times sake.\u201d As Arthur watches, Merlin moves away from the bed, opening curtains and uncovering his breakfast. \u201cGeorge was actually rather defensive. I had to promise I wasn\u2019t going to take my old job back or hurt you before he would let me set foot anywhere near your chambers.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHurt me?\u201d It takes him a moment to remember why anyone would think Merlin capable of hurting anything. \u201cDoes he know?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cArthur, the servants always know.\u201d Merlin favors him with a vaguely pitying look before he finishes setting out the food. \u201cNow, come and eat.\u201d</p>\n<p>Arthur does as he is ordered. He\u2019s not sure how he could do otherwise. Merlin is back in his rooms, like he never left. A hole in him is healing, even if Gwen\u2019s absence is still there beside him. \u201cWill you eat with me?\u201d he asks. It doesn\u2019t escape his notice that there is clearly enough food for two. </p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t mind if I do.\u201d Merlin drops into the chair across from Arthur and serves himself a hearty helping of eggs. A look of pure pleasure goes over his face as he bites in, and he makes a noise that makes Arthur blush. \u201cGods. I had forgotten how well you ate.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cYou clearly need to eat more,\u201d Arthur retorts, so Merlin will stop making sounds like that. </p>\n<p>\u201cExcuse me for travelling to find the magic that will better protect Camelot,\u201d Merlin grins and bites into an apple. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t stay and wallow in the lap of luxury like\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIs that why you went?\u201d </p>\n<p>Merlin\u2019s grin falters. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIs that why you left? To learn more magic?\u201d Arthur\u2019s good mood hasn\u2019t evaporated, but it\u2019s certainly weakened. </p>\n<p>He sets down the apple. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t going to be a better time, Arthur.\u201d His voice is sad, regretful. \u201cGaius had taught me all he could. I needed to be better prepared. And you\u2014Morgana was defeated, the kingdom was stable. You had the knights. You had Gwen. I wasn\u2019t needed.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGood to know,\u201d Arthur mutters, looking down at his food. He doesn\u2019t want to say that he was needed. That Arthur had needed him. That Arthur still needed him. \u201cGlad you decided that. Glad I didn\u2019t get a say. Glad everything didn\u2019t go to hell when you were gone.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cArthur.\u201d Arthur looks back at Merlin. Merlin\u2019s face is very, very serious. It doesn\u2019t look right on him. Arthur wants Merlin to be smiling, laughing, looking like the idiot he is, not this sober-eyed man, old before his time. He wants to chase away that age, has a sudden urge to do a handstand just to make Merlin laugh. \u201cIt didn\u2019t go to hell. You held the realm together.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGwen\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGwen was not your fault.\u201d Merlin swallows. \u201cShe was my friend too. I should have known. I should have said. I didn\u2019t. There\u2019s nothing to be done. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d </p>\n<p>Arthur pauses. Thinks. Doesn\u2019t think. The hole Gwen left, he knows, will never be filled. And maybe that\u2019s just the way things have to be. \u201cCan you find them?\u201d</p>\n<p>Merlin\u2019s eyes widen. \u201cYes. But Arthur, that\u2019s a bad\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t. Don\u2019t look. I just wanted to know. In case I ever had to.\u201d And that\u2019s that, he supposes. Gwen is gone. But still\u2026 \u201cIf you could check\u2014sometime\u2014don\u2019t tell me\u2014but if she\u2019s happy\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShe is.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cHm?\u201d</p>\n<p>Merlin actually blushes, cheeks stained with red that goes all the way down his neck and under his shirt. Arthur wonders just how far down it goes. Not that he really cares. \u201cI may have checked up on her, sometimes. And you. Everyone.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course you did.\u201d Arthur rolls his eyes, and eats some more breakfast. He has a kingdom with suddenly permitted magic to deal with. </p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>For the next few weeks, Arthur deals with the repercussions of letting magic into Camelot. Merlin, as far as Arthur can tell, does nothing. He has meals with Arthur in his rooms, goes to the tavern with Gwaine, spends long hours holed up in Gaius\u2019s chambers. He spends time in the stables and at court, takes walks into town and shuts himself into the library. </p>\n<p>It\u2019s going to make Arthur\u2019s heart fail. Not that he isn\u2019t happy Merlin\u2019s back. He is. That\u2019s the problem. He might have once been used to Merlin everywhere, always next to him when he needed the support, but now every time he sees Merlin his heart jumps, gives an extra thump in surprise and joy that Merlin is back. It\u2019s a bloody nuisance. </p>\n<p>And so is he. Arthur had forgotten just how irritating Merlin could be, popping up whenever Arthur just wanted to have a good sulk and coaxing him out of it by being so bloody cheerful Arthur just had to throw something at him, breaking his mood. He\u2019d forgotten just how easy it was for Merlin to make him laugh. </p>\n<p>And to make him groan, because he also had always had a way of bringing up whatever Arthur least wanted to talk about at the moment. He certainly hasn\u2019t lost that gift, slipping into the council chamber as the knights file out. Gwaine grins at him and punches his shoulder, Leon bends down for a muttered word\u2014and when did they get so chummy, Arthur wonders, and worries\u2014Elyan and Percival give him easy smiles. He seems to have slid easily into the knights\u2019 good graces. He probably just bought them ale, Arthur thinks grumpily, and remains seated at the table.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes?\u201d he snaps, and ignores the double beat of his heart as Merlin sits in the seat next to his. The seat that used to be Lancelot\u2019s, Arthur finds himself remembering, almost without bitterness. </p>\n<p>Merlin, though, looks unusually thoughtful as he leans forward and braces his elbow on the table. Arthur finds his gaze following the movement of his fingers as he cups his chin, then flicking to his lips. They move as Merlin speaks, making round \u2018o\u2019s and then opening. \u201cArthur, what are you going to do about Morgana?\u201d</p>\n<p>Arthur shakes his head, brings his gaze back up to Merlin\u2019s eyes. Stupid. What was he doing, dropping into daydreams staring at Merlin\u2019s lips? \u201cHm?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou can\u2019t keep her locked up forever.\u201d </p>\n<p>Arthur straightens. If whatever magic Merlin wrought to keep her there was failing\u2014Merlin waves his free hand. \u201cWell, you can, I suppose, unless she gets considerably stronger. I spent a lot of time pouring magic into the wards on those cells. Unless she gets, like, a dragon to break her out\u2014well, no, a dragon wouldn\u2019t do it, I made sure of that, but maybe a Sidhe\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMerlin.\u201d Despite the topic, Arthur holds back a smile. He hasn\u2019t changed. Arthur needs to remember that sometimes, when he can remember Merlin\u2019s eyes glowing golden and holding back a whirlwind. When sometimes that image haunts his dreams, and not with fear. \u201cGet to the point.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat? Right.\u201d Merlin swallows, and his eyes go serious again, deep and dark, infinitely blue, like some of the lakes at the north of Camelot, deep mountain pools. \u201cYou could keep her locked up forever, but Arthur\u2014do you want to?\u201d</p>\n<p>Arthur sighs. He has thought about this, actually. He\u2019s discussed it with Leon, with the other knights. \u201cI don\u2019t see what else I can do. I can\u2019t let her go, and you showed that we can\u2019t kill a sorcerer of that much power.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cActually\u2014\u201d Merlin\u2019s chest rises and falls beneath his shirt, and he nips at his lower lip. A totally inappropriate wave of heat goes through Arthur at that simple motion. He ignores he. He was always good at ignoring it. Especially when Gwen was around. \u201cYou can. I could\u2014well, you could. No matter what she did. You could execute her.\u201d</p>\n<p>Another sigh. That only makes it worse. \u201cDo you think I should?\u201d </p>\n<p>Merlin\u2019s eyes widen, as if he hadn\u2019t expected to be asked. He never used to ask, Arthur supposes, though he always listened. That sort of pride seems so petty now. He likes having someone to ask. </p>\n<p>\u201cI think,\u201d Merlin says slowly, \u201cThat you can\u2019t keep her. You either need to let her go or kill her.\u201d He pauses, but it\u2019s the sort of pause that leads to something else. </p>\n<p>\u201cAnd?\u201d Arthur prompts. That is a masterful restating of the problem. </p>\n<p>\u201cAnd\u2014has she heard about the magic?\u201d Merlin asks. \u201cThat isn\u2019t all of it, not even a bit, but\u2014it could help. And,\u201d he closes his eyes, opens them again, and Arthur can see for a moment the lost boy who came to Camelot, the one who looked at him when Will died, even when Balinor bled out in front of him. The one who used to look at Morgana with gawping, admiring gazes, so worshipful that Arthur had purposefully turned away rather than consider why Merlin never looked at him like that. \u201cI don\u2019t want to kill her.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNeither do I.\u201d Arthur breathes it out, more a whisper than a statement. Morgana has terrorized Camelot, broke his father\u2019s heart, may be halfway to insane. But she is also the girl he grew up with, wild and passionate and fiercely righteous, the girl who helped teach him what it meant to care for his people, the girl who had snuck him cake when he was sent to his room without food and had stayed up late eating it on his bed. </p>\n<p>\u201cThen\u2026\u201d Merlin trails off. </p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell her.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Merlin stands when Arthur does. \u201cArthur\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll talk to her. Tell her about magic. We\u2019ll see what happens then.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cArthur\u2014\u201d Merlin says again, barely a step behind him as they leave the council chamber. \u201cShe\u2019s dangerous.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s what you\u2019re here for,\u201d Arthur replies amiably, and takes a sharp left. Merlin doesn\u2019t miss a beat in following him. </p>\n<p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLook.\u201d Arthur stops, whirls, so that Merlin almost bumps into him. He grabs at Merlin\u2019s forearms, to steady him and to drive his point home. \u201cDo you want to execute her? This is the only way out I can see.\u201d </p>\n<p>Merlin tenses, but then Arthur can feel the fight go out of him. \u201cMaybe we can find a different way.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t see how.\u201d He\u2019s holding Merlin awfully close to him, he notices suddenly, so he can feel the heat of his body and count the freckles on his cheeks. More than there were before. If he leaned in an inch, their foreheads would touch. Or their lips. </p>\n<p>He lets go, moves back. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d </p>\n<p>Merlin follows him down the stairs.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Morgana is standing when they enter the room, her head tipped proudly back, her face set in coolly regal lines. There are no fire creatures around her; the cell seems colder. \u201cArthur,\u201d she says simply. Then, \u201cMerlin. I see you\u2019ve returned.\u201d She doesn\u2019t sound insane, doesn\u2019t sound like the woman who laughed as Arthur nearly burned. She sounds like the girl who had stood in this dungeon and spat at Uther for his prejudice. </p>\n<p>\u201cAs have you,\u201d Merlin says, and steps back into the shadows by the door. He\u2019s on the other side of the bars now, Arthur muses, and wonders if Morgana knows. </p>\n<p>\u201cNot quite as welcome as you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Merlin\u2019s grin flashes, as cold as hers. \u201cYou\u2019d be surprised.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cVery little would surprise me about Camelot.\u201d She turns that icy gaze to Arthur. \u201cSo, brother dear, what brings you to my cell?\u201d the words are eerily similar to Merlin\u2019s, months ago. Arthur hopes\u2014but he doesn\u2019t let himself hope much. </p>\n<p>\u201cI thought I\u2019d bring you news,\u201d he says, and moves closer to the bars. A show of trust, he hopes, not one of threat. \u201cI\u2019m not sure how much you hear down here.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNot much.\u201d She smiles, shows her teeth. \u201cFor some reason, it would seem your guards are afraid of me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThey always were,\u201d Arthur counters. He\u2019s close enough that she could touch him, should she choose. He\u2019s been in more dangerous spots, but he feels the tension in the air, like another battle. </p>\n<p>\u201cYou always were too soft on them,\u201d Morgana agrees, and glides forward. Arthur remembers a girl who would scream at him for overworking the men, and wonders when the hatred took root. Had he always lost her? \u201cPerhaps that\u2019s why Camelot is so easy to take.\u201d</p>\n<p>Arthur bristles. \u201cYou\u2014\u201d Merlin\u2019s hand on his shoulder, like a bath of ice water, balancing him out. \u201cYou,\u201d he says again, but in control this time. \u201cdidn\u2019t manage it this time.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo thanks to you.\u201d Again, that sharp-toothed smile without mirth. \u201cWhere is Emrys? Have you had him killed yet?\u201d</p>\n<p>Arthur takes a deep breath. \u201cNo. I haven\u2019t. He\u2019s safe.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cAh, so much nobler than father dearest. Or not, I suppose. He did allow Gaius to live, after all.\u201d Her voice is infinitely bitter. \u201cThe Pendragons reward those who betray their own kind.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cMorgana\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, Arthur.\u201d Her dark eyes are hot now, swimming with emotions he cannot read. \u201cListen to me now. This I tell you, so that you may glory in the joy of it. Emrys is not yours, will never be yours. He is the Old Magic\u2019s, and so he is mine. You hear me?\u201d Her voice is high and sure and fierce. \u201cMine.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe is his own,\u201d Arthur answers evenly through the fire roaring in his veins, screaming at him to stop her from daring to claim Merlin, though he can hear Merlin shifting in the background. Is he Emrys? Or was that simply a name? </p>\n<p>Morgana ignores him. Her eyes are wide and unseeing, staring into the distance above the bars. \u201cAnd this too I swear, Arthur Pendragon, now King in Camelot. When I escape these bars, I shall take my revenge. On Camelot, and on you.\u201d As she says the last word, her eyes focus and her hand darts out, spider swift, towards his throat. Arthur jolts backwards, and would have evaded it, but her eyes flash golden and he feels something pulling him back, just a gentle tug but enough that he is slowed, and she has a knife darting at him from the other hand and\u2014 </p>\n<p>\u201cNo.\u201d Merlin says it simply, as sure as Morgana\u2019s oaths. He steps forward, raises his hand, and it is glowing as gold as his eyes. The pull is gone, Arthur darts away. \u201cMorgana, don\u2019t bother. Your blade will not work in here. You know that as well as I.\u201d</p>\n<p>Her mouth actually drops, the first sign of surprise Arthur has seen on her yet. She looks younger, somehow, like the girl who had first come parentless to Camelot. But not saner. \u201cYou? But\u2014you? A mere servant? A peasant? And you said\u2014you didn\u2019t\u2014\u201d Then she tips her head back and laughs, that high, cold, manic laugh. \u201cOh, Arthur, look who you have had beside you all this time? A traitor to the throne!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMerlin is not a traitor,\u201d Arthur says. He moves back, so he can stand beside Merlin. \u201cMagic is no longer a crime in Camelot, Morgana.\u201d</p>\n<p>She barely sobers. \u201cFor him? For the boy who serves your food and makes your bed? Is he your great magician, Arthur? Will you stand against me with him?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI had hoped you would have no more quarrel with me,\u201d Arthur replies. </p>\n<p>She goes from laughing to terrifyingly sober in an instant, and presses herself against the bars. \u201cI will have quarrel with you until I have what is mine,\u201d she hisses, and her tongue flicks like a snake\u2019s. \u201cUntil I have Camelot.\u201d</p>\n<p>Arthur studies her, sadly. She is the only family he has left. Blood and breeding both. \u201cI\u2019m sorry to hear that,\u201d he says, and turns to go, Merlin once more a step behind him. </p>\n<p>She laughs as he reaches the door. \u201cAnd how is my dear Guinevere these days?\u201d she drawls. \u201cThriving, I\u2019m sure. Happier than she ever was here.\u201d It hits Arthur like an icy blade through the gut, because it is probably true, but as he steps towards the door he hears Merlin turn and he speaks in a voice that echoes off the cave walls. </p>\n<p>\u201cYou will stay here until you rot, Morgana Pendragon,\u201d he says, and Morgana actually stumbles back, onto the ground. Arthur flinches, pulling back like a one might recoil from a lightning bolt. Merlin moves forward like a wave, like a gust of air. But when he speaks again, his voice is cool and cruelly kind. He leans down, so he is level with her. \u201cOr until you learn to love again.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI love,\u201d she spits at him. \u201cI have just lost all who I loved.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHave you?\u201d He tilts his head. \u201cIt is a poor soul who has so much hate that she cannot see love where it still grows.\u201d </p>\n<p>She hisses and spits in his face. Arthur moves forward this time, to answer the insult, but Merlin simply wipes it off and stands. Something changes in him as he does, as he shifts and his hair changes and suddenly the sorcerer is standing in front of Arthur again. Morgana\u2019s sharp intake of breath is audible throughout the room. </p>\n<p>\u201cAnd Morgana,\u201d Merlin says, the sorcerer says, as he stands tall and proud, like the light is drawn to him. He is almost beautiful in that moment, for all men are not supposed to be beautiful, beautiful and wild and regal. \u201cThis I swear. Emrys is, and always was and will be, for Camelot. And for Arthur.\u201d</p>\n<p>Then the light around him is gone, and he is Merlin again, and Morgana is wheezing out laughter as he strides out, pulling Arthur beside him. \u201cYou!\u201d she cackles, \u201cYou!\u201d</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>They don\u2019t speak again until they are back in Arthur\u2019s rooms. Arthur sits at his desk, but Merlin collapses onto Arthur\u2019s bed as if all the strength of his legs gave out. </p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Merlin says at last, \u201cI lost my temper.\u201d</p>\n<p>Arthur swallows. He\u2019s never been afraid of Merlin, but if he ever was, he thinks now would be the time. Not for the power he showed\u2014but for the fear Morgana did. He has never seen anyone frightened of Merlin before, not the sort of fright that a condemned criminal shows in front of a tribunal. \u201cThat was losing your temper?\u201d</p>\n<p>Merlin shrugs. \u201cShe shouldn\u2019t have brought Gwen into it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Arthur agrees. He probes at the emotional wound that Morgana gave him, and finds it shallower than he thought. It\u2019s as much humiliation now, he thinks, as grief and anger. \u201cBut that\u2019s Morgana.\u201d It always was, really. She had always known where to shove the knife. </p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s Morgana,\u201d Merlin agrees. He throws himself sideways onto the pillows. For a moment, Arthur just studies him there, comfortable on Arthur\u2019s bed. As if he were meant to be there. Then Merlin raises his head again. \u201cWe can\u2019t let her go.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Arthur agrees, and barely recognizes the \u2018we\u2019. \u201cBut\u2014I don\u2019t want to kill her, Merlin.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou might have to.\u201d Merlin says it evenly, resolutely, and Arthur has to stare, because he knows those decisions, has had to make too many, but he never thought Merlin did. But there is a darkness in Merlin\u2019s face that says he knows the choices that damn your soul. </p>\n<p>\u201cNot now,\u201d Arthur decides. He has made too many of those choices. He has made too many choices, and now he is alone. Except for Merlin. \u201cMaybe\u2014maybe she\u2019ll come around.\u201d It sounds weak, that hope. But Merlin simply raises an eyebrow and doesn\u2019t call him on it. Instead, he lies back into the pillows. </p>\n<p>Arthur turns resolutely to the papers on his desk and does not think about Merlin on his bed. But that only starts him thinking about Merlin in other places, and then, \u201cWho\u2019s Emrys?\u201d he asks conversationally.</p>\n<p>\u201cMe,\u201d comes from the bed. \u201cIt\u2019s another name. What the druids call me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd then why was Morgana scared of it?\u201d he presses. Something is burning in the memory of Merlin\u2019s words, of Merlin swearing himself to Arthur forever. </p>\n<p>Merlin rolls over so he can face Arthur. \u201cDestiny.\u201d He keeps his face absolutely serious until Arthur starts to laugh, then he cracks a grin. \u201cNo, really. There\u2019re prophecies.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAbout you?\u201d Arthur picks up a scrap of paper, wads it into a ball, and throws it at Merlin\u2019s head. It hits, dead on, of course. \u201cCome off it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCome off it yourself, you prat. Why do you think I ever stuck around when you ordered me to muck out stalls?\u201d Merlin throws the ball back. It hits the desk. </p>\n<p>\u201cBecause you swore yourself to me,\u201d Arthur taunts. \u201cYou said it. No take backs.\u201d </p>\n<p>Merlin sobers. His voice has that rumble of thunder in it when he talks. It shakes through Arthur. \u201cI meant it, you know. I am yours. Forever.\u201d</p>\n<p>Arthur swallows down the knot that rose into his throat. \u201cI know.\u201d He rises, walks over so he can put a hand on Merlin\u2019s head. It\u2019s the oddest oath of loyalty he\u2019s ever taken, but he has a feeling it\u2019s the truest. \u201cI\u2019ve always known.\u201d His hand shifts, slightly, so it is against the side of Merlin\u2019s face instead of the top, his thumb brushing against Merlin\u2019s cheek. </p>\n<p>\u201cGood.\u201d </p>\n<p>Then Merlin rolls up to punch Arthur in the stomach, and they\u2019re laughing and wrestling like they\u2019re boys again, and the fate of a kingdom doesn\u2019t rest on Arthur\u2019s shoulders.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>\u201cArthur.\u201d It\u2019s Gwaine again, hovering after a meeting of the knights. Arthur looks, unconsciously, to his cloak. It\u2019s not really moving, so he\u2019s not worried. Not that he would be worried otherwise. But sometimes he has nightmares where Gwaine\u2019s cloak joins with Gaius\u2019s eyebrows and chases him around the castle. </p>\n<p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cD\u2019you think Merlin isn\u2019t quite happy here?\u201d</p>\n<p>That makes Arthur sit up straight. Merlin has to be happy here. \u201cWhat?\u201d he demands. </p>\n<p>\u201cHe just\u2014he can\u2019t seem to settle.\u201d Gwaine shrugs. His cloak bounces, a little accusingly. \u201cI\u2019ve lived that. Just wondering if you\u2019d seen it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, I hadn\u2019t,\u201d Arthur says through gritted teeth. He can\u2019t distrust Gwaine, not on this\u2014he is Merlin\u2019s friend, and Arthur knows they spend a lot of time together, and he trusts Gwaine more than anyone except himself to look out for Merlin\u2014but he hates the implication that he should have. \u201cThank you for pointing it out for me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNot a problem,\u201d Gwaine says with his bright grin. \u201cI think I\u2019ll go find him and we\u2019ll hit the tavern. That\u2019ll cheer him up. Don\u2019t worry,\u201d Gwaine says at Arthur\u2019s glare, \u201cI\u2019ll return him in pristine condition.\u201d</p>\n<p>He leaves, his cloak swaying jauntily behind him. </p>\n<p>Arthur stares at the wood grain in front of him, but he doesn\u2019t see it. Is Merlin discontented? He\u2019s always smiling when Arthur sees him, always willing to lend a hand or talk something over with Arthur. He\u2019s even started coming to council meetings again, though he hovers in the corner. As if he\u2019s not sure he belongs there, Arthur realizes vaguely. As if he\u2019s about to bolt. </p>\n<p>He\u2019s not Arthur\u2019s manservant anymore. He apparently had to swear to George that he wasn\u2019t going after his old job to be allowed anywhere near Arthur. And there was a new physician, with his own apprentice, for all Arthur still sought out Gaius whenever he could. Merlin had returned, but his spaces had all been filled. </p>\n<p>It strikes Arthur, suddenly, that he knows all this. That he figured this out on his own. That he understands Merlin. That he never understood Gwen. That he needs to make Merlin a place\u2014or make him realize his place, because he\u2019s always had a place here, even before he came the first time, though neither he nor Arthur realized it, that space beside Arthur, to whisper advice into his ear\u2014before he leaves again. Before he too breaks Arthur\u2019s heart. </p>\n<p>Because it would. That comes to Arthur like a mace to the head. He fell into love with Gwen easily, gradually but with the understanding of every step. He had felt it grow in him until it ruled his heart. But this\u2014what he feels for Merlin\u2014it\u2019s the same, but it isn\u2019t. It\u2019s been growing but he didn\u2019t see it until now, until he realized Merlin was unhappy and might leave again, until he thinks of life without Merlin and can\u2019t imagine it. And now it just dropped onto him, with the full weight of everything that had grown before, equal but different from what he had felt for Gwen. He drank poison for Merlin. He spilled his heart to Merlin before he knew it was him. He let magic into Camelot for Merlin. </p>\n<p>He can\u2019t let Merlin go. </p>\n<p>So he does what he does best. He starts to plan. </p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Merlin is clearly confused when he walks into the throne room. Arthur watches him move forward from his seat on the throne, watches Merlin throw confused glances at Gaius\u2014who made it down from his chambers for the occasion\u2014and at the knights, who all hold in grins, except for Gwaine, who winks broadly and lets his cloak billow proudly around him. </p>\n<p>Merlin doesn\u2019t look small, as most people do in front of the throne. He kneels, but his head is back so he can meet Arthur\u2019s gaze, with confusion and challenge and a hint of exasperation, and a bit of something Arthur wants to think is fondness. Emrys, Arthur, who does know how to do research when he wants, thinks. A lord in his own right. \u201cMy lord,\u201d he says from his knees. </p>\n<p>\u201cMerlin,\u201d Arthur says in acknowledgement. He rises to better address the crowd. \u201cWith the recent laws that have been passed, bringing magic back to the land, we have seen a new influx of magic users. Many of these are good, prosperous citizens we are happy to welcome to this land.\u201d Merlin\u2019s eyes are still confused, but there is pride there as well, and Arthur resists the urge to preen. \u201cOthers are not so friendly. All are subject to new rules, rules that this court has not dealt with for many years. To this end, to advise the king in matters magical, both in giving laws and in defense, a new position on the council has been formed.\u201d There are murmurs amid the crowd, now, and a dawning light in Merlin\u2019s face. \u201cMerlin, do you swear do use your magic solely for the service of Camelot, to honor the downtrodden and helpless?\u201d He had specifically crafted the oath to sound like the knights\u2019, because Merlin is a knight in his own way, has fought for him with the same nobility and honor. </p>\n<p>Merlin\u2019s grin is blinding. \u201cI do swear, Sire.\u201d</p>\n<p>Arthur nods, and wonders if Merlin knows he\u2019s glowing. \u201cRise, Merlin, Court Sorcerer of Camelot.\u201d Merlin rises and bows, the sort of bow he never gives Arthur. </p>\n<p>\u201cI will serve with pride,\u201d he says. Arthur jerks his head to the dais. Merlin obediently walks forward. </p>\n<p>\u201cYou will advise me at court and in council,\u201d he announces. Then, quieter, \u201cHappy?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWith pride and honor,\u201d Merlin murmurs into Arthur\u2019s ear, so Arthur can feel his breath on his cheek. Then, with a smile in his voice, so Arthur knows if he turns his head there will be a dimple, \u201cAnd to keep your head from getting too big.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Arthur mutters back, then nods at the herald, who leads in the next petitioner. Merlin stands tall and steady at his back. </p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>The sorcerers attack two weeks later. To free Morgana, Merlin claims, though Arthur isn\u2019t sure how he knows. All he knows is that his men can only do so much against these mercenaries and their ice-eyed leaders. They can only watch as the sorcerers take up positions around the castle and start\u2014something, something that even Arthur can feel, like prickles down his spine, like something growing at the edge of his field of vision.</p>\n<p>It irritates him, but he can see it is doing more to Merlin. Merlin, who watches the sorcerers from the tallest tower with grim eyes, who answers all of Arthur\u2019s questions but grows dark circles under his eyes as he spends nights pouring over books to break whatever spell the sorcerers are building. People look at him sideways, as if he might break, as if he might join the sorcerers; Merlin ignores them, though Arthur glares them away whenever he sees them. Can\u2019t they see Merlin burning himself away? </p>\n<p>\u201cMerlin.\u201d The light glowing above his head catches on his dark hair, almost lost in a book as big as his head.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d He doesn\u2019t look up. </p>\n<p>\u201cMerlin,\u201d Arthur says again. </p>\n<p>Merlin tears himself away from the book with something almost like a snarl. His face is pale in the witchlight, \u201cWhat, Arthur?\u201d </p>\n<p>Arthur sighs. He wants to push Merlin into bed and never let him out. He wants to brush away the shadows beneath his eyes. He wants to chase away the tension in his shoulders. Instead, he asks, \u201cHave you\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Merlin snaps. \u201cNo, I haven\u2019t found anything, trust me, you\u2019ll be the first to know.\u201d He scrubs his face with his hands. Arthur waits. \u201cSorry. It\u2019s getting to me.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cI know.\u201d Arthur leans against the arm of Merlin\u2019s chair and peers over his shoulder at the book. He still can\u2019t read one word in three, and the diagrams are incomprehensible. But he can feel Merlin\u2019s warmth, can take the excuse to brush against him, to feel his unthinking support and give him some in return. </p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s just\u2014it doesn\u2019t make sense,\u201d Merlin goes on. \u201cThey\u2019re gathering energy at each nexus, but they aren\u2019t connecting, and the power isn\u2019t going out but it isn\u2019t building up, either, and where can it be going?\u201d He rubs at his forehead. \u201cI can\u2019t feel it, Arthur, and I should be able to.\u201d</p>\n<p>Arthur lets a hand run comfortingly down Merlin\u2019s back. Comfortingly. He won\u2019t distract Merlin with something like his feelings now, when he\u2019s trying to save them all. He won\u2019t distract himself, when he has to rule. There will be time enough. Merlin won\u2019t leave him again. \u201cYou\u2019ll find it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Merlin smiles, something almost resembling his grin. \u201cWas that a compliment?\u201d</p>\n<p>Arthur rolls his eyes and moves his hand to cuff Merlin on the back of the head. \u201cYou might be an idiot\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHey!\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cBut you are also the Court Sorcerer of Camelot, which means you are duty bound to outdo the magic of every one of those sorcerers out there. I know it\u2019s hard, but we all have our duty.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd yours is to be King of the Prats,\u201d Merlin shoots back, and Arthur laughs despite everything. God, but its good for Merlin to be back. </p>\n<p>When he sobers, Merlin is looking up at him with deep, dark eyes. His face is serious again. \u201cWe could let Morgana go.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI know.\u201d Merlin runs another hand through his hair and sinks back into his chair, so his head brushes against Arthur\u2019s forearm. \u201cBut if I can\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou can.\u201d Faith for faith, loyalty for loyalty. Two boys who once took poison for each other. Arthur wonders if he loved Merlin even then, but Gwen has obscured all before her. All he knows is that he loves him now, and he wishes he didn\u2019t have to be king. \u201cYou will.\u201d</p>\n<p>Merlin nods, straightens with new strength. \u201cThanks,\u201d he says, quietly. </p>\n<p>\u201cWell, you won\u2019t if you don\u2019t eat anything,\u201d Arthur goes on, to move away from the emotion thrumming in Merlin\u2019s voice. Not now. There\u2019s time. \u201cI\u2019ll make sure a servant brings you up dinner.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll get it my\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cA servant,\u201d Arthur ignores him, forces a smile onto his face. \u201cMaybe I\u2019ll send George. I do know how much you two love gossiping.\u201d</p>\n<p>Merlin spins and glares, but the corners of his eyes are crinkling with laughter. \u201cYou are an evil, evil man, Arthur Pendragon.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd you left me with him for years,\u201d Arthur retorts, and finds its not even supposed to wound. \u201cThis is revenge.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cEvil!\u201d Merlin calls as Arthur leaves. Arthur laughs until he climbs high enough to see the sorcerers at their posts. Merlin is the only thing that stands between them and Camelot. And Arthur\u2014Arthur can only wait and depend on Merlin.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s not as hard as it should be. </p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>A week later, the ground begins to tremble. Arthur rushes to the tower with Merlin on his heels, his knights in a flock behind them. Merlin carries a mirror, and he bickers with Gaius over it, things that Arthur doesn\u2019t bother to listen to because he won\u2019t understand it. </p>\n<p>A chasm is opening. All around Camelot, the earth is groaning, roaring, as it is pulled away. Arthur can\u2019t tell what it\u2019s meant to do, other than build them a new moat, but he has a feeling its not good. </p>\n<p>\u201cMerlin\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThey\u2019re summoning a demon,\u201d Merlin snaps, both at him and the mirror. \u201cIf it gets here, Gaius\u2014yes, I know. I know what it\u2019ll do. I have to.\u201d He drops the mirror onto the crenellation, and looks out. Then he turns to Arthur. \u201cThe demon is like nothing you\u2019ve ever fought. Nothing I\u2019ve ever fought. It\u2019s\u2014remember the dragon?\u201d Arthur nods. He remembers, remembers what it did to Camelot. \u201cTake that and multiply it a thousand times.\u201d</p>\n<p>Arthur blanches, but it\u2019s Leon who asks the question. \u201cHow do we stop it?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI stop it from coming,\u201d Merlin says sharply. \u201cI close the rift.\u201d</p>\n<p>It sounds simple enough. </p>\n<p>\u201cSo why didn\u2019t Gaius want you to?\u201d Gwaine asks, moving forward to put a hand on Merlin\u2019s arm. He stares at the crack widening in the ground. His cloak is lank at his back. </p>\n<p>Merlin sighs. \u201cBecause it very well could kill me. That much power\u2014this far along\u2014\u201d he shakes his head, as \u2018kill me\u2019 echoes in Arthur\u2019s brain, as everything in him frantically clamors for him to hide Merlin away somewhere safe. \u201cI can\u2019t tell how much of me it\u2019ll take, but there\u2019s a better than likely chance it\u2019ll be everything.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Gwaine snaps instantly, \u201cDon\u2019t do it. There has to be another way. Arthur, tell him.\u201d </p>\n<p>Everyone turns to Arthur, but Merlin\u2019s the only one he sees. Merlin, who came back to him despite the threat of death. Merlin who swore himself to Camelot before he did to Arthur. </p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s the only way,\u201d Merlin says, softly, just for Arthur. \u201cOr it\u2019s the only way which will work quickly enough, so it\u2019s the same thing.\u201d</p>\n<p>Arthur looks out at Camelot, at the city, at the people quivering in fear. At the courtyard where Merlin didn\u2019t burn. He thinks of Gwen, who finally has a man who puts her before all else, before his people and his land. He wishes he could be Lancelot. He wishes he could not be a king. He wishes Merlin didn\u2019t know his choice before he made it, hadn\u2019t made it for himself. </p>\n<p>\u201cDo it,\u201d he says, and feels his heart rip open even as the earth does. </p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2014\u201d Gwaine begins, but Merlin shakes him off, pushes him gently back. </p>\n<p>\u201cLet\u2019s hope this works,\u201d he says with a grin, with his old flashing grin, and Arthur can\u2019t help himself. He can\u2019t quite convince himself Merlin will die, Merlin who didn\u2019t die no matter how hard he tried, but\u2014if he does\u2014</p>\n<p>Aerthur moves forward, captures Merlin\u2019s lips with his, tries to pour all of his desire and love and faith and need and come-back-to-me-I-order-you-I-will-kill-you-if-you-don\u2019t into it, and Merlin lets out a moan and kisses back just as forcefully, as desperately, like he is memorizing Arthur\u2019s face and lips. </p>\n<p>The ground moves, pushes Arthur back. \u201cI\u2014\u201d he starts.</p>\n<p>Merlin only smiles. \u201cI know,\u201d he says, even as his eyes turn to golden. \u201cWhy do you think I came back?\u201d </p>\n<p>And then the words rolling off his tongue are a different language all together, and they thunder out over the land, and Arthur can see the sorcerers stop, look up, and he imagines the fear on their faces as Merlin roars out his words, his magic, and it must be powerful because Arthur can see it, can see the golden flood race over Camelot and into the chasm, filling it up, pulling it together, and Merlin is shaking and glowing and slowly, slowly, the earth begins to groan again, and the land pulls itself back together with a scream like a dislocated shoulder being fixed. </p>\n<p>Merlin collapses. Arthur catches him before he can hit the ground, praying, hoping, even as Leon barks out orders to check on the other sorcerers, just wanting Merlin to breath, to be alive, to have been wrong about this once so he can make fun of him about it for the rest of their lives. </p>\n<p>\u201cCome on,\u201d he mutters, as he grabs at the mirror to hold it to Merlin\u2019s lips, \u201cGoing to let a little thing like this kill you after all my work? Make me ashamed to have called you my sorcerer, you\u2019ll prove Morgana right, you can\u2019t be dead, you can\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>And then the mirror fogs, and Merlin\u2019s eyes flicker open, gold still flashing in them. \u201cCan\u2019t kill me that easily,\u201d he murmurs, and then his eyes are closed, and Arthur is carrying him to Gaius\u2019s chambers, trying not to weep or laugh in relief. </p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Arthur is sitting at Merlin\u2019s bedside when he opens his eyes again. He\u2019s never telling Merlin how long he sat there\u2014which was every moment since he fell unconscious. </p>\n<p>\u201cYou,\u201d he says severely, and doesn\u2019t comment on how his hand is clutching Merlin\u2019s like if he lets go Merlin will slip away, \u201cHave a bad habit of nearly dying.\u201d</p>\n<p>Merlin lets out a near-silent laugh. \u201cYou,\u201d he retorts, and squeezes Arthur\u2019s hand, \u201cHave a bad habit of nearly getting me killed.\u201d </p>\n<p>Arthur grins, uses his free hand to push Merlin hair out of his eyes. He says, still mock-stern, \u201cAs long as I am the only one trying to kill you, I think we\u2019ll be okay.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry.\u201d Merlin takes Arthur\u2019s hand, raises it to his lips, in something that could be fealty or something more. From the look in Merlin\u2019s eyes, Arthur\u2019s guessing the latter, and something heats in him, in his heart and elsewhere. \u201cYou\u2019re my favorite executioner.\u201d </p>\n<p>And then Arthur has to lean over him and swallow his laughter with a kiss, and make sure Merlin\u2019s still there, still alive, still his.</p>"
