  "text": "<p>Summer gathers the remnants of Hawkins\u2019 population in a grip of dry sand and sweltering heat.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Back in the days of Harrington house parties and his empire of underage drinking, the start of summer would act as a ribbon Steve would cut on the party scene in Hawkins. The first party he would host would give way to a shockwave of other, not-as-good but still worthwhile time wasters around the neighborhood, Hawkins\u2019 suburbia lit up with specially-bought disco lights and the familiar red-blues of police cars crawling the streets to sweep up the easiest pickings of the bunch to satisfy angered neighbors.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Today, Steve does not move. Steve lies in bed as humidity licks up his skin like an enthusiastic labrador, trying not to choke as he tilts a cool beer bottle to the dry flesh of his lips.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t have plans to plaster his ID down on the counter at the liquor store two towns over to buy it out of cider, beer and the burn of cheap, shitty vodka; no plans to get wasted at the shore of Lover\u2019s Lake while Tommy palms some pretty blonde off on him. His sweat won\u2019t mingle with her\u2019s, he won\u2019t brave the rolls of heat as skin meets skin until the only solution is the lapping waters at their feet.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Two, three summers ago, that would\u2019ve been Steve\u2019s routine. Drink, swim, fuck and maybe sleep. Destroy his home for the rush of fumbling teens shouting out his name like he was their pariah, the messiah\u2014pick up the glass shards of his mother\u2019s vase the next morning, scrub the sink free of someone\u2019s drinking limit reached.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Today, Steve only moves from his bed to get another bottle.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He knows Robin is worried, knows she\u2019s roped Nancy in on it too, to the point where Jonathan Byers of all people, back from Cali for good, had knocked on his door to do a welfare check.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Steve had sent him on his way with a little baggy of weed he\u2019d bought for the nightmares, bought his silence about the broken furniture and beer bottles that littered the palace floors of castle Harrington.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The next time Jonathan came around, he stayed. The two of them smoked up and drank and kept distance between them to avoid the discomfort of skin sticking to skin, let alone their previous misdemeanors they continued to bury.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>High-Jonathan told Steve that he was worried about Will, that his brother kept waking up in cold sweats, dreaming about versions where they lost, where Hawkins was divided up in a flaming disaster as Vecna had wanted.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Steve told high-Jonathan that he\u2019d been dreaming about Eddie in the Upside Down, alone, scared and fighting, every night like clockwork since they\u2019d been forced to leave his body there.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>High-Jonathan had the nerve to look at him like he was crazy.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He wasn\u2019t the first person Steve had told\u2014as soon as it started, he\u2019d gone to speak to Dustin.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you dreaming about Eddie?\u201d He\u2019d asked, and then Dustin had wailed and collapsed in a heap of grieving teenager in his arms and Steve got his answer. <em> Yes. </em>But not in the way he had.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Dustin had described dreaming about Eddie\u2019s death over and over again, a recurring nightmare. Steve had swallowed his tongue and said that his were the same.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>How was he meant to look the kid in the face and say that in all of his dreams, Eddie was <em> alive\u2014 </em>and terrified.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>In the dreams he was always running from something. Typically, Steve would be the one he ran from\u2014though he knew it wasn\u2019t <em> him, </em>Eddie was fleeing from some abomination that had trickled into Hawkins before, now trapped in the dimension it had been birthed from.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Sometimes, Steve was flying in a pack, light and airy. Other times, Steve was on all fours, claws scraping the dirt for grip and the final push to try and catch the <em> prey, </em>catch Eddie.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The worst of times Steve was tall. Too tall, prowling and stalking, desperate, hungry.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Eddie was good at running. Really good. It made Steve wonder why the one time he <em> needed </em>to run, he didn\u2019t. Steve wonders if it was his fault, if by telling him one thing Eddie felt the indignant urge to do the other.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It had made Eddie their only casualty, by the end of things.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Steve had returned, pumped full of bravado and a twinge of unease, Vecna\u2019s body gone from the ashy cutout it had scorched into the dead grass.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>(There had been no final chime of the clock. Erica had brought another Walkman, just in case\u2014and Lucas had knocked Jason out cold before Max\u2019s bones had broken. She was safe, though rattled. Lucas was beaten, but did not have to feel the gaping loss of someone he loved.)</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>But outside of the trailer, Dustin was screaming so loud Steve felt his insides die and rot, terrified that he had returned to see the kid he cared for too much in agony, near-death. Then his body had shifted, angled itself towards Steve, and bundled up in shaking arms was a corpse. A ghost of a person they had grown to know, to accept as one of their own.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Eddie was dead. There was no doubt in it\u2014his blood soaked enough of the dying ground to bathe in it, his insides uncomfortably outside. His corpse was so desecrated, practically in two pieces\u2014Steve couldn\u2019t bear to try and carry it back through with them.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Dustin had punched him in the face when Steve forcibly dragged him through the gate in Eddie\u2019s trailer. The shock was more palpable than the pain\u2014because he stood there and took it. Dustin got three, maybe four hits in before Nancy managed to wrangle him away.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It wasn\u2019t like he had a strong arm\u2014but Steve\u2019s nose bled, almost in lieu of tears. Dustin had fought Nancy, had screamed a barrage of insults Steve <em> knew </em>he didn\u2019t really mean, but still stuck, anyway.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>This was the kid he\u2019d grown to think of like a brother. The kid who\u2019d called him a <em> monster, </em>who\u2019d blamed him and probably still did when El\u2019s powers had sealed the gates, sealed Eddie\u2019s body in another dimension.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The kid who couldn\u2019t look at him when the police force officially announced an apology for mistakenly naming Eddie as a suspect, clearing his name in death despite the town\u2019s confusion.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The kid who\u2019d let Steve comfort him, told him about his nightmares\u2014but when Steve had driven them both to the cemetery to visit Eddie\u2019s grave, Dustin had made a comment about it being empty.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><em> Because of you, </em>had been implied in the pain of his voice.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It would never be the same between them. Not with Eddie dead, his body never laid to rest in peace.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Dustin was the first of the people Steve cared about that he stopped talking to. Not the last.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Robin had been next.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>They\u2019d returned to work far too soon, tense and sharp around the edges despite being under the guise that this was meant to be a <em> victory. </em>They\u2019d won.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>But Robin would refuse to sort the tapes in the horror section, and Steve would be scared to go out back alone. It was stupid but it was mutual, they shared in the outlandish terror of normalcy and had each other when shit got weird.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>So a month after Eddie\u2019s death, Steve told Robin about the dreams. Sat with her in the storage closet and explained each and every one, admitted that he\u2019d begun thinking just <em> maybe </em>\u2014he was alive.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Steve had told her he wanted to go back, somehow. To get him, or his body, at the very least.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Robin didn\u2019t believe him. She wasn\u2019t <em> malicious, </em> but it felt malign, the rejection\u2014she\u2019d chalked Steve\u2019s dreams up to survivor\u2019s guilt, used his distance with Dustin as an explanation and told him that what he was suggesting was <em> insane.\u00a0 </em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>And when Steve got blazing mad, white hot anger lashing out at the one person he\u2019d always expected to have his back through whatever crazy shit was happening\u2014Robin insisted he take the week off.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Gather himself. Go process the grief he\u2019d clearly been putting off, like this was all some big act because he didn\u2019t want to admit how much he cared about Eddie.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Steve had taken the week off.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>And the next.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Then he just never came back to work.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Robin had called, Steve had ignored her. She came round, shouted through the windows until his neighbors had threatened to call the police. She wrangled Nancy to her cause, both of them finding similar results\u2014meaning Steve <em> ignored </em>them, or was passed out in his room gripping the neck of a bottle, dreaming about Eddie running. Eddie alive, though dying.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Then came Jonathan\u2019s welfare checks. A smart idea on Nancy\u2019s behalf, no doubt\u2014Jonathan was relatively harmless. He didn\u2019t care enough about Steve to force him to take care of himself, but would also turn him on his side so he didn\u2019t die in his sleep, or whatever. He was easily bought with weed, and didn\u2019t nag or judge that much when they were both high out of their minds.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He would go back and tell Nancy and Robin what they wanted to hear. Steve would be left alone to dream about Eddie.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>(The kids had called by, once or twice. Clearly Dustin had told them that Steve wouldn\u2019t come round to see him anymore, not even for Mrs Henderson\u2019s dinners. They\u2019d insisted it was because they wanted to use his pool in the heat, but Steve had opened the door a crack, just a little drunk\u2014sleepy, not much of anything else. Max had taken one look at him and forced them all to leave.)</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>For Max, Steve answered the phone. Max, he left it on the table, sat and listened as she screamed at him for what he was doing, drinking instead of talking to them. Steve weakly tried to explain that it helped him fall asleep for longer\u2014let him try to figure out what was going on with Eddie.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Max had told him that it was nothing to do with <em> Eddie, </em> and was all to do with <em> him </em>throwing away everything good in his life.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>She didn\u2019t call back after that.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>But no matter what anyone said\u2014it wasn\u2019t <em> like </em> that. Steve was drinking out of necessity, it had always helped him stay asleep and that\u2019s what he needed right now. He couldn\u2019t see a full picture of Eddie in a couple of hours, he had to stay under, figure out if this was <em> real </em>or if Steve was a head case.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>If he got five hours or more, he could watch Eddie weave and duck in the foliage of the Upside Down, see glimpses of him hiding, sometimes even crying, begging. The first time Steve got eight hours of sleep in months, maybe even <em> years, </em>he heard Eddie\u2019s voice, low, mumbled swears and song lyrics whispered to himself in the dark.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Steve locked his doors, drew his blinds and kept the house dark, pitch-black. Kept himself inebriated, tired and confused so when sleep came, his brain wouldn\u2019t know the time; know any better.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Days or weeks could have passed\u2014Steve wouldn\u2019t know. But when he fell asleep in a bath he\u2019d filled with ice to avoid the close weather keeping him uncomfortably awake, he saw Eddie. <em> Really </em>saw him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He was covered in grime, head to toe bathed in a mix of blood and dirt and otherworldly substances without a name to them. He was in Steve\u2019s bedroom, the wallpaper from a couple years ago, his varsity jacket still hung up proudly. A trinket of who Steve used to be.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Eddie takes the jacket\u2014bundles himself up in it, <em> Harrington </em>spread between his shoulder blades in big, bold letters.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Steve feels his heart clench, something uneasy churning in his gut. A <em> warmth, </em>a tentative fondness. Back then, he\u2019d always wanted Nancy to wear his jacket. It was a possessive sort of thing, which made him smile to think about. She\u2019d hated the idea, of course\u2014the colours were gaudy and she never liked to feel like she was something of Steve\u2019s, though he can\u2019t fault her for it.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Seeing Eddie wear it now, pulling it over marred skin like a shield, a comfort, a piece of Steve to protect him now, though he didn\u2019t before\u2014</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Steve wakes up to the lights in his house on the fritz, frantic and throbbing like the pulsing walls of his head, a homing beacon, a taunt. They spark and jitter, flickering, their thrum coiling around the drums of Steve\u2019s ears until all he feels is the pounding blood lapping up his better instincts. Stumbling from the bath, he holds the butter-coloured walls of the landing with a damp hand, clothes dripping with cool water; teeth chattering, though for nerves or the cold he\u2019s not sure.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He follows the hysteria of the electrics into his room, where the petal-shaped bulbs in his ceiling burn like cats\u2019 eyes in the headlights of cars thundering up the highway. Bright enough to bring Steve\u2019s hand to shield his face, to urge tears to drip through his lashes, though maybe from shock, drink or simply the ache the glaring lustre the Upside Down beckons burns into his skull.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Steve knows what this means. Remembers the pivotal shift of his life; bystander to fighter. Where he\u2019d leaned up against his car door, eyes as wide as dinner plates, gleaming through the front facing window of the Byers\u2019, Christmas lights singing the tune of death.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>This isn\u2019t a coincidence. This isn\u2019t Steve going <em> crazy.\u00a0 </em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201c<em> Eddie </em>?\u201d His voice is hoarse, warm with the drink and rough with the strain of his scalding anguish.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The lights falter. Flickering, dimming.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>For an awful second, Steve thinks he\u2019s lost him. Wonders if Eddie had heard his voice and fled, or maybe he had, truly, gone <em> insane. </em>If he\u2019s imagined him all along\u2014because of all people to seek help from, why would Eddie pick Steve? Steve, who left his corpse to rot, who trusted him to run, maybe beckoned him to do the opposite just by asking him to save himself.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bathed in darkness, Steve finds himself on his knees, bile hot and thick in the cavern of his throat, brothing, boiling. The room is spinning, he finds one arm to curve around the pulsing wounds from the bats, eyelashes wet with fat, defiant tears.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Then the decade-old lampshade stuffed in the tightest corner of Steve\u2019s room starts to hum, the gentle hue of its bulb kissing the damp flesh of his face, licking it in stripes of tender light and love.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cEddie,\u201d Steve\u2019s laughing now, his broken voice marred by sobs and uncontrollable bubbles of relief, a promise, a <em> certainty. </em>He wasn\u2019t crazy\u2014and Eddie wasn\u2019t dead. \u201cEds, you\u2019re\u2014you\u2019re here, oh, man, you\u2019re really here,\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Taking it into two shaking hands, palms slick with sweat and bath water, Steve cradles the lamp between his knees, presses it up against his chest. It was a substitute\u2014a confirmation, his savior, proof that his gradual descent into unutterable self-destruction was <em> worth </em>something.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The lamp light flickers, almost giggling with him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI miss you. I know that\u2019s stupid,\u201d Steve hiccups, suddenly aware of the bottle of tequila he\u2019d hounded down his throat like a firecracker earlier in what he <em> thinks </em> was the afternoon. \u201cI really sorta liked you, man. You were funny and embarrassing and I fucking liked that shit. You\u2014you were a total <em> freak </em>and I think, you\u2014we should\u2019ve been friends. We really should have? Why weren\u2019t we\u2014we should have,\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Drunken nausea swirls in the deepest pit of his stomach, bitter claws scratching at the lining of his throat. The lamp light dims, then glows once, dips again, glows again, for a slightly shorter duration.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It feels a bit like <em> shut up. </em>Steve laughs, and kisses the dusty floral lampshade, giggling through his panting sobs. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I wasn\u2019t\u2014if I knew you\u2019d be here, I would\u2019ve\u2014I wouldn\u2019t\u2019ve, y\u2019know,\u201d He hiccups again, sending him into another weak spurt of giggles; a final burst of murky water from a dying fountain.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The lamp dims, then glows. Almost a demonstration\u2014a call to attention.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Steve goes quiet, like a child scolded. Hand in the cookie jar, juice spilt on the carpet.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He was always shit at Boy Scouts. Steve hated the stupid fiddly knots, didn\u2019t like getting dirty and wasn\u2019t big on the whole shelter building thing either. But when something saves his life, he typically remembers, even in a mix of tequila and vodka-induced haze.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Morse code. The same piece they\u2019d used in the Wheeler house to communicate with Dustin.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em> S.O.S. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>Nancy and Jonathan are on a road trip back to California to see Argyle. Steve knows this because of a scrappy note posted through his front door, scraggly and apologetic and entirely his new smoking partner\u2019s handiwork.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>This is relevant because Steve just walked the distance to the Wheeler house, half-drunk and entirely high on the adrenaline of being right, the fear of wasting time and losing Eddie all over again. And Steve is scaling her garage roof like he\u2019s done many times before, making sure to keep his feet steady in the wooden paving attached to the brickwork, sucking in breaths and bringing his knees up to his chin until he\u2019s able to bodily shove her window open, tumbling inside on all fours.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Steve hopes that Nancy doesn\u2019t consider Argyle enough of a threat to take her guns with her to California.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>She doesn\u2019t\u2014they lie there, hidden behind multiple boxes that pretend to guard shoes but instead case ammo, shelved up to reveal her growing collection.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The sawed shotgun is there, wrapped up in a tawny-coloured dress. Steve slots it on his back, tucking it into the army gear he\u2019d retrieved from the back of his closet as soon as Eddie\u2019s message had dimmed. The Makarov is a few boxes away too, the one lifted from the Russians\u2014Steve has no idea how to use it, decides it can\u2019t be all that hard and stuffs it in his pocket. The Smith &amp; Wesson Model 10 M&amp;P handgun is also at a total loss to Steve, but in his drunken, determined bravado, once again decides it won\u2019t hinder him in the slightest.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He gathers the ammo he can find, stuffs it down the army jacket, and knows that when it comes down to it, he\u2019ll always know how to wield his bat, at the least.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Getting in wasn\u2019t the problem, despite Steve\u2019s struggle with the window, and Karen Wheeler\u2019s new hyacinth.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Getting out meant crawling backwards, trying to balance the shotgun so it didn\u2019t drag his weight diagonally, swearing when his foot missed the latch in the trellis. He ends up sprawled out like a starfish on his back in the Wheeler\u2019s perfectly maintained hedges, groaning as the neck of the gun carves an unhappy indent into his spine.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Mike hovers above him, eyebrows raised in a pinch, arms folded tightly across his chest. He holds himself like he\u2019s always witnessing someone do something truly <em> stupid, </em> judgement scrawled across his face like words carved into stone. He\u2019s what the masses would call a <em> typical </em>teenage boy, despite his superpowered girlfriend and his previously-possessed best friend. Bitter, grumpy, snappy.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Standing over Steve, he looks a perfect mix of all three.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat the fuck is this? You ignored all of us for months and now you\u2019re\u2026 breaking into my house?\u201d There\u2019s an uptight tone to his voice, painfully familiar. The anger pushed his words out in a venomous hiss, quiet enough to be wary of waking his parents yet still dripping with poison. \u201cAre you stealing shit for drug money?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Spluttering, Steve abandons his attempts to hide the obvious weaponry strapped to him in an effort to dissuade <em> this </em> narrative. \u201cI don\u2019t\u2014 <em> what? </em> I don\u2019t do drugs, <em> Mike!\u201d </em>His own whispers are slightly messier, though entirely aware that Ted Wheeler waking up to witness this interaction would be an awful, awkward affair.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cUh, <em> yeah, </em>you do\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWeed does <em> not </em> count,\u201d Steve hisses, chopping his hands in a firm <em> no </em> motion. \u201cAnd I can <em> afford </em> weed, I\u2019m not\u2014I\u2019m not stealing shit from your house for <em> money, </em>Mike,\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cBut you <em> are </em> stealing shit from my house?\u201d Mike juts his chin out, victory gleaming in his catty little eyes. \u201cWhat the fuck is wrong with you, Steve? Max says you\u2019re like, an <em> alcoholic </em>now.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Raising his eyebrows, Steve goes to deny that allegation, only to be cut off by Mike swiftly grabbing his face, scowling into his eyes. \u201cYou\u2019re drunk right now, fucking Christ.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m really <em> not,\u201d </em>Steve insists, slapping prying hands away.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Mike\u2019s face suggests a total disbelief in Steve\u2019s barked argument, but he drops him anyway, scoffing. \u201cYou smell like tequila,\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou should <em> not </em> know what that smells like\u2014but I\u2019m not <em> drunk, </em>I was drinking, there\u2019s a difference,\u201d One hand pointing in aggressive gesticulations, Steve entirely foregoes his previous effort to hide the huge shotgun strapped to his back, let alone his nail bat hung on the hook of his side.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Mike notices this time, his indignant scoff lost to his wordless effort to look at Steve like he\u2019s <em> insane. </em> \u201cWhat the fuck, Steve, are those my sister\u2019s guns? You <em> stole </em> my sister\u2019s <em> guns?\u201d </em>Then he notes the nail bat, groaning with all the force of disdain a teenage boy can have. \u201cYou\u2019re going to try and go back to the Upside Down. God, you\u2019re so fucking stupid,\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Mouth dry, Steve shakes his head. \u201cNo, I\u2019m <em> not.\u201d </em>He\u2019s not sure if he\u2019s denying being stupid or going back to the Upside Down.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m calling Hopper,\u201d Mike spits, starting to storm up his garden path\u2014startling when Steve grabs his elbow.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDo <em> not </em> do that\u2014\u201d His whispers become more like frantic gasps of air, eyes wide and probably wild. \u201cMike, please,\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The boy looks at him again, and clearly Steve must be in a state, because if they were in daylight, he\u2019d be much more sure that there was <em> worry </em>on Mike\u2019s face. Mike tugs his arm out of his grip, holding it against his chest defensively, brow furrowed like Steve was some kind of problem he didn\u2019t quite understand. \u201cTell me exactly what you\u2019re doing, right now. Or I\u2019ll yell really loud so mom calls the police,\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It feels just a little bit like a compromise. Which is strange\u2014because Mike has <em> never </em> compromised with Steve in his <em> life. </em>It\u2019s all or nothing with him. Front seat, or he won\u2019t get in the car and will tell his mom Steve left him behind. Curly fries to share in the diner, or he\u2019ll go home hungry and say he was starved.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>For Steve and Mike, this is <em> revolutionary </em>. Something to shout about, if they weren\u2019t so determined to keep the Wheeler parents asleep.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cEddie\u2019s alive,\u201d Steve says, voice as firm as steel, as certain as the sun rising in the east. \u201cI saw him in the Upside Down in my dreams,\u201d He pauses, waiting for Mike to mock him\u2014he doesn\u2019t. He just stares, big, dark eyes cold and concerned. \u201cThen he spoke to me through the\u2014the lights, in my house. He did the, the uh, morse code thing, the S.O.S.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI know what the S.O.S. signal is, Steve,\u201d Mike says, though there\u2019s not much bite to it.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Steve looks at him, <em> knows </em> his expression is pathetic, a little desperate, maybe. Because then Mike sighs, and drags his hand down his face like Steve is unloading some great burden onto his judgement. \u201cHave you thought about how, <em> just </em> maybe, this is a massive fucking trap? Even if you aren\u2019t insane and\u2014you <em> are </em>really seeing this, how would Eddie be alive again?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>When Steve doesn\u2019t pipe up, Mike presses on. \u201cDustin said Eddie was so\u2014like, <em> so </em> dead. Nearly in two halves dead. The Upside Down is a fucked up place, maybe it brought him back, or whatever, but\u2014it would have to be for a reason, right? Come on, Steve. Why are you the only one seeing this shit? Something\u2014something is trying to <em> lure </em>you. Maybe Vecna, maybe the Mind Flayer.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Biting at his lip, Mike stuffs his hands into his pockets, unable to stand firmly in the same spot of his front lawn. \u201cJust\u2014come talk to everyone about it. Like we always do. I can buzz the Party, call Hopper\u2014we can talk about it. But you can\u2019t just <em> go </em>to the Upside Down like it\u2019s a gas station, or some shit. El sealed the gates. How are you planning on getting through again?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Unconsciously, Steve\u2019s hand wraps around the handle of his bat. Mike looks at him incredulously.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re just gonna smash your way through? If <em> that </em>worked, the scientists at the lab would\u2019ve destroyed Hawkins years ago,\u201d Mike rolls his eyes, exasperation oozing from his every pore. \u201cGod, you\u2019re an idiot.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Sighing, Steve pushes himself onto his feet, slowly to try and save his head from the relentless spinning of the hours following tequila. \u201cTwenty minutes, Wheeler,\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Mike\u2019s hands find his hips, lines of confusion and indignance carving into his face like damaged pottery. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cGive me twenty minutes,\u201d Steve says, hand firm on his bat. \u201cTwenty minute head start. When it\u2019s been twenty minutes\u2014do your worst. Call Hopper, call the calvary\u2014just give me twenty minutes.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a pause in which Mike seems to think, face scrunched up like a pug, scrutinizing Steve\u2019s every word. \u201cWhere are you even going?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s three gates. That\u2019s, like\u2014a high probability you\u2019ll find me quick,\u201d Steve was never much of a maths man, but as he wheels one of the bikes leaned up against the house back over to Mike, he gets a stingy look suggesting his odds are pretty shit.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Mike\u2019s arms wrap around himself, protective, defensive. \u201cTwenty minutes. You won\u2019t get through the gate anyway, but\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>His hesitance stops Steve as he prepares to cycle away, shifting to turn back and stare expectantly for the rest of the sentence.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The hardness of Mike\u2019s expression melts away into a more blatant, heart-aching concern. \u201cSteve\u2014if you do get through, just\u2026 don\u2019t. Be as stupid as you are usually, right? This is a fucking <em> trap, </em>and if you get in there and die immediately it\u2019ll be really embarrassing for you,\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Steve says, trying to keep his confusion out of his voice.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He fails, clearly\u2014Mike looks frustrated, balling his fists at his sides. \u201cListen, just\u2014Dustin, right? He\u2019s already lost Eddie. And when Max told us you thought he was alive, we all\u2014made sure he didn\u2019t hear that shit, cuz we thought you were just losing your goddamn mind. Drinking and hiding in your house, whatever\u2014\u201d Swallowing thickly, Mike drags a hand through his own hair, displacing the unruly order of his bangs.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIf you die too, especially\u2014when you haven\u2019t been speaking to him. He\u2019ll be destroyed. Like, <em> totally </em>destroyed. He\u2019s barely even functioning right now, asshole, so if you\u2014\u201d Then the unimaginable happens.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Mike brings his fists up to his face, and starts to <em> cry.\u00a0 </em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Steve has never seen Mike cry. <em> Never. </em>Not even when he was a kid, when Billy came around and frightened the shit out of them all, not even when he almost lost his mind over El having some creature in her leg at the Battle of Starcourt Mall.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>But here he is, sobbing in the middle of the night on his own front lawn, hiccuping and trembling in a totally uncharacteristic display of distress.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Steve drops the bike, drops his bat\u2014stumbles over it to grab Mike by the shoulders, strong-arming him into a hug. It\u2019s awkward and uncertain, they\u2019ve never hugged before, nor <em> wanted </em>to\u2014Mike was always one of his kids, but always the furthest, the most bitter and stubborn.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>But it\u2019s a hug. And eventually Mike gives in, his arms falling away from his face and sitting limp at his sides, allowing for Steve to pull him against his chest.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>They stay like that\u2014Mike\u2019s shoulders heaving and releasing in a push and pull of exhaustion and weariness. It\u2019s only now, Steve curling his hand against the expanse of Mike\u2019s back, trying to console whatever <em> this </em>is\u2014does he think about it.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Even as they stand now, Mike is wearing his <em> Hellfire Club </em>shirt.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Eddie meant a lot to Dustin, there\u2019s no doubt about that. Steve knew it, envied it, then loved it, lost it. But he\u2019d never considered the other boys, Lucas, Mike\u2014even Max, who\u2019d lived across the way from Eddie, a feature in her life whether he meant to be or not.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Then there was <em> everything </em>else. Mike almost losing his best friend to the dangers of the Upside Down, having to be on the sidelines while his girlfriend took her mind, body and soul to the brink of destruction to save them all. It can\u2019t be easy.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Steve\u2019s eyes find the darkness of the Wheeler house, the pretty suburban picture. He thinks about Mike in that big house, his parents always there but not <em> really. </em> Never being able to understand him, Mike never being able to speak to them about why he\u2019s hurting. He\u2019s alone in that house, alone in his struggles because in the Party there\u2019s always someone who has it <em> worse, </em>always someone suffering more.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>So Steve brings Mike into a bone-breaking hold, squeezes the air out of him and tries not to think too hard about how he <em> understands, </em>knowing it could spill out from his lips in a disaster of words and emotions, knowing he\u2019d scare Mike off for good.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t die,\u201d Mike says after a sharp intake of breath, shoving Steve off of him roughly. \u201cIf you die I\u2019ll never fucking forgive you. It\u2019ll destroy the Party forever. Twenty fucking minutes and then I\u2019m calling <em> everyone.\u201d </em> Then he scrubs at his face with the cotton of his sleeve, breath staggered and ruined. \u201cTwenty minutes starting <em> now, </em>Steve, get the fuck out of here!\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Taking the bike back into his hands, Steve shoves his bat in the space under his arm, tensing his body to keep it there as he pushes off of the pavement. It takes every scrap of self-control he has to not look back, entirely too aware of the soft spot he has for those damn kids, because one glance back to Mike could make him give in altogether.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Steve <em> can\u2019t </em>give in. He can\u2019t listen and wait, because if he waits for the group to gather and make a plan Eddie might be dead again by the time they get there.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>And that\u2019s <em> if </em>anyone listens to him anyway. What if they don\u2019t? What if Steve tells them everything and nobody believes him as they haven\u2019t been, if they think he\u2019s completely insane, in denial or worse\u2014some victim of Vecna; the Upside Down.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>They\u2019d dismiss him. Make sure he didn\u2019t do anything stupid. Eddie would be abandoned, left to fend for himself and die all over again.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Steve can\u2019t take that risk. So he peddles\u2014hard enough to set a campfire up in his muscles, limbs aching and burning as he pelts it up the winding roads of Hawkins at god-knows what time. He feels the comforting lull of the alcohol he\u2019d drank spark up and fizzle out, sweating it out from the exertion of traveling across the entire town by bike.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Occasionally he has to stop, a handgun or pack of ammo toppling from his pockets leaving him to stumble off the seat and scuff his shoes on the curb trying to retrieve his lost goods. Every second of stupidity or fumbling only makes the time limit he\u2019s bartered with Mike glaringly obvious in the back of his mind, a reminder that he needs to <em> hurry up.\u00a0 </em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Because man, if Hopper knew what he was about to do, he\u2019d absolutely throw him in jail. Steve doesn\u2019t have to be a genius to know that this is really, <em> really </em>stupid. But Nancy\u2019s always been the one with the brains and the plans, Robin\u2019s his smarter, better half and Eddie was the comedic relief, the realist\u2014Steve was the guy who hits shit really hard and used himself as a meat shield to protect everyone else.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>That didn\u2019t require brains. So this plan, if it can be called that\u2014is absent of any.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Something that is once again <em> really </em> clear when Steve wheels his stolen bike into the trailer park and remembers at the very <em> last </em>minute that Max lives here too, even if her bedroom light is off. She\u2019s not really slept all that well for a while, judging by the times the voice mail tells Steve her occasional, furious messages to him were recorded.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>One wrong move and she startles like a street cat. Screw calling the others\u2014Max would undoubtedly find some way to take Steve down and tie him to a radiator, or something.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>So Steve is careful. His liquid courage has drained out of him, left with the sickly aftertaste of being sober, his only motivator fear. He creeps, slipping under the yellow police tape cordoning off Eddie\u2019s old trailer, surprised to find the door unlocked.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>(In hindsight, he should\u2019ve thought about that a little more. Despite the incompetence of the police force after Hopper\u2019s \u201cdeath\u201d nobody leaves a crime scene unlocked.)</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The gate is above-head, pulsing, angry, red. It\u2019s straining against whatever El had used to seal it, throbbing like a vital organ freshly cut from a human body. It\u2019s visceral, turning Steve\u2019s stomach as he takes his bat, trying to push himself to swing at it before he loses the will to.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a click by his ear.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t move,\u201d Follows a gruff, rasping voice, the cool metal of what he assumes to be the butt of a gun pressed against the back of his skull. Whoever this is clearly intends to imply they can shoot him dead, military style.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><em> Is </em>the military still here? It\u2019s Steve\u2019s first thought, he\u2019d stumbled on a leftover night watch, one of the lab goons sent to guard the gate, maybe even try and see if they can open it up again, the bastards.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cY\u2019got five goddamn seconds t\u2019state y\u2019case, boy, or I\u2019ll blow that pretty head\u2019a yours wide open,\u201d Is groused into his ear. When Steve hesitates, a fist takes his hair and <em> pulls, </em>forcing him to turn at an unnatural angle by his neck, straining his eyes to the face of his attacker.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Oh, <em> man. </em>That makes a lot more sense.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It\u2019s Wayne Munson.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He\u2019s dressed in scruffy, worker\u2019s denim, face marred with the sort of anger grief can only spur, scorn and scrutiny sparking the only light in his dark, familiar eyes.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He\u2019s got Eddie\u2019s eyes, Steve notes. Deep and thoughtful, the window to the soul\u2014in this case, Wayne\u2019s only deferring characteristic away from this <em> burning </em>rage, a stark contrast to his nephew. Eddie\u2019s eyes were a gaping hole in the part he played, the raw emotions he\u2019d hide behind a curtain of rebellion and playful defiance swimming in the depths of their pretty browns and hazels.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Steve realizes when Wayne cocks a brow that he\u2019d been doing way too much staring and way too little talking.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re the Harrington kid,\u201d Comes the accusation, eyes narrowing. \u201cGuess I shoulda known by the hair,\u201d Forcing a laugh out of his throat like he tends to do in most life or death situations, Steve keeps his body tense in its awkward position, nervously smiling at Eddie\u2019s uncle.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHi,\u201d He musters, swallowing because there\u2019s very much <em> still </em>a gun leveled at his head, and that\u2019s the sort of head injury he won\u2019t come back from like he had his others.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wayne doesn\u2019t look impressed by his lack of panicked explanation, but shoves him out of his grip all the same, lowering the gun he\u2019d aimed,\u00a0 though not disarming himself. \u201cWhy\u2019re you here, Harrington? Guessed you were one\u2019a them kids here to try and destroy what I\u2019ve got left of my Ed, but them folk told me you were one of the lot down there,\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Down <em> there, </em>meaning the Upside Down.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>They must have told him\u2014even if it was the bare minimum of need-to-know. The government can explain away a portal growing in the ceiling of his home, but when his nephew died in the world that opening leads to\u2014that\u2019s harder to brush off.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Steve had assumed they\u2019d moved him someplace else, someplace nicer to try and make the bitter pill of loss easier to swallow. One look at Wayne, now they face each other, and Steve reasons that they had\u2014Wayne grips something in his other hand, a bundle of clothing, a shirt maybe.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Probably Eddie\u2019s. He feels a little sick, a lot <em> awful, </em> he\u2019d disturbed Wayne\u2019s grief, though neither of them should be here the man had <em> far </em>more right to be.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI, uh. I left something,\u201d Steve says, mouth dry.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wayne\u2019s eyebrows raise again. \u201cIn my trailer?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d He looks up without really thinking, staring at the growth on the ceiling.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>If Wayne\u2019s eyebrows went any higher, they\u2019d slip off of his head entirely. \u201cYou\u2026 left somethin\u2019 in <em> there? </em>Special \u2018nuff to drag your sorry self back?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Teeth finding his lip, Steve gnaws, anxious. \u201cYeah,\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The gun is pointed back in his direction. \u201cGet the fuck outta here. Either y\u2019still <em> lyin\u2019 </em> to me or y\u2019just plain fuckin\u2019 stupid. Y\u2019wanna go back there, <em> boy? </em>After what it did to my Ed?\u201d It\u2019s a blatant accusation, a token of offense taken, the nose of the gun shaking in Wayne\u2019s trembling hands.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI know your father, <em> boy </em> .\u201d He uses the word with venom, authority; a reminder that Steve is young and dumb. \u201cHe\u2019s a cruel man, a slimy rich mother <em> fucker </em> . Thought he\u2019d raise ya to be just like \u2018im, turns out he\u2019s raised ya to be a goddamn mother fucking <em> idiot </em>,\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>One fist gathering the front of Steve\u2019s shirt, Wayne pushes him up against the inner wall of the trailer, pressing the gun up to the curve where his chin meets his jaw.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It\u2019s painfully reminiscent of Eddie with the broken bottle against his neck, expression raw with fear and actions riddled with a wild desperation.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Their mannerisms are mirrored, Wayne\u2019s older, slower, but still the root in which Eddie\u2019s grew. The way their brows crease in the wrath of fear, the lopsided downturn of their mouths. The way they hold their shoulders, the way their arms tremble, saving the force for the fists.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>This is the man who raised him, nurtured him, loved him. Who built him up to be witty and fond and proud, bright and brave until the end. If anyone deserves to <em> know, </em> to <em> believe, </em>it\u2019s him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s alive,\u201d Steve says firmly, and wholeheartedly knows it to be true.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wayne\u2019s face creases with a pained fury, a desperate sadness pooling through his eyes. \u201cY\u2019gotta be cruel to play games like this with an old man, boy,\u201d There\u2019s nothing to punctuate the end of the sentence, it\u2019s left open\u2014capable to suggestion, continuation. It\u2019s an invitation for Steve to continue, to persuade, comfort.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not,\u201d Steve whispers, biting back the need to cry. \u201cHe spoke to me\u2014through the lights. He, the\u2026 morse code, he did the S.O.S. signal, he needs me. He\u2014He\u2019s who I have to go back for. I left him,\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHe was dead when y\u2019left him,\u201d Wayne says, tears gathering at the corners of his eyes, frustration coating his grief in a thick varnish.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Steve curves his hand to grip the wrist that keeps the gun steady against his chin, squeezing lightly. \u201cI know he\u2019s not dead anymore. I <em> feel </em>it,\u201d It\u2019s a weak argument, but Wayne\u2019s grip seems to falter. \u201cIf I\u2019m wrong, you can shoot me when I get back.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wayne pushes himself off of Steve in a rough, harsh motion, turning on his heel and stuffing the gun into his pants. \u201cShut up, boy. If ya lyin\u2019 to me I\u2019ll bury ya where my boy should be lyin\u2019. But you ain\u2019t, and I know you ain\u2019t, so if ya <em>wrong </em>when <em>we</em> get back I won\u2019t do shit to you,\u201d He looks back, pulling a heavy coat over his work clothes.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cFrom the looks of it you\u2019ve been sufferin\u2019 hell\u2019of a\u2019nuff over my Ed. If ya wrong, I know ya can punish y\u2019self far better than I could,\u201d And he <em> reads </em>him, sifts through him like a hardback copy of a novel, drags the pads of his fingers along the pages of Steve and closes him sharply, leaving him to feel exposed, confused.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>(Eddie could do that too, Steve thinks to himself. Read him and leave him open, ready for the insult or mockery that should come with such a thing, yet never finding it.)\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Then Steve falters. \u201cWait\u2014when <em> we </em> get back? Mr Munson, uh, <em> no?\u201d </em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cCall me Wayne,\u201d He says, before jostling Steve around and plucking the shotgun off of his back. \u201cJesus, boy. Y\u2019know this here\u2019s a felony? Sawing off shotguns like this? S\u2019good idea, though,\u201d Wayne hums appreciatively, taking the handle of the Makarov and stealing that, too.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHey\u2014<em> hey, </em> what? Uh, Wayne, sir, this is <em> not </em> happening,\u201d Steve tosses his hair out of his face, making an <em> X </em> motion with his arms. \u201cYou can\u2019t\u2014come with me, it\u2019s <em> insane </em> down there and you\u2019ve never\u2026 <em> seen </em>what\u2019s down there before. No way,\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wayne fiddles with the severed barrel of the shotgun, sliding the Makarov into his belt before fixing Steve a bemused look. \u201cI said call me <em> Wayne, </em> not sir, boy. I\u2019m not your goddamn army officer,\u201d Then he cocks the shotgun, squinting into it. \u201cI <em> did </em>serve in Korea, though,\u201d And then he snaps it back shut, slipping it under his arm.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cUh\u2014Wayne,\u201d It feels wrong on Steve\u2019s tongue, almost disrespectful. \u201cIt\u2019s\u2026 it\u2019s bad down there.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd my boy\u2019s down there, so ya sayin\u2019, Harrington. My boy\u2019s down there and if y\u2019gonna go get him, like hell is it gonna be without me.\u201d Wayne claps Steve on the shoulder, almost in an act of camaraderie, and moves them both to stand under the gate. One finger pointing up, Wayne gives a firm nod. \u201cY\u2019gonna pop that thing open. And we\u2019re gonna fight our way through whatever the shit is in our way to gettin\u2019 my boy home.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Steve tries to protest, but the stern look on Wayne\u2019s face is so painfully <em> Eddie, </em>it\u2019s difficult to muster the courage to do so. The man seems to sense this, and gives him a squeeze for the trouble. \u201cThis is my home, Harrington. I know ya pops wanted us trailer trash gone and in another town, but he ain\u2019t succeeded yet.\u201d Guilt drips off of him in gentle droves, but Wayne doesn\u2019t say it maliciously, just matter-of-factly.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThis is my home, Harrington. Y\u2019ain\u2019t gonna tell a man what he can and can\u2019t do in his own home, are ya, Steven?\u201d Wayne smacks a hand into the dead-center of his back, encouraging, gruff.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSteve,\u201d He corrects, still a little wide-eyed, a deer on ice. Unsteady and unprepared. Wayne\u2019s face breaks into a brusque smile, rippling crotchety wrinkles up his rough skin.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSteve,\u201d Wayne echoes. \u201cThis is my home. Eddie\u2019s my boy.\u201d And then he ruffles his hair with one large hand, coarse from years of working with them, in an action that reminds Steve of Hopper. The instinct to father; seek that kind of passing paternal affection. It makes his chest ache, a cavern of something <em> missing, </em> makes him want to flee the same way he does whenever Hopper wrangles an arm around his shoulder and calls him <em> kid.\u00a0 </em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna go down there and get my boy back. You\u2019re gonna be my tour guide.\u201d He holds his hand out for the final gun Steve has stashed, which he gives over reluctantly. He finds Wayne remarkably difficult to argue with\u2014wonders if Eddie found the same. \u201cTour guides don\u2019t need guns. You point at somethin\u2019, I shoot it. Got it, Steve?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Steve knows his face must be the most amusing picture of shock, because Wayne just cracks open another grin and angles his head back up to the gate. \u201cYou gonna get that baby open or what, boy?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Dragging a hand down the damp skin of his face, Steve sighs with every inch of exhaustion he\u2019s collected on his journey to get here, limply shaking his head. Scouring the floor of the trailer, he sweeps a wonky chair from the kitchen, placing it just underneath the pulsating growth on the ceiling.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cCan you, uh, pass me the shotgun, sir?\u201d Steve says sheepishly, balanced haphazardly on the seat. Wayne looks unimpressed, maybe by Steve\u2019s refusal to use his name or the demand for his very illegal shotgun\u2014but either way, offers it up to him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Angling the butt of it against the scarlet, muscle-like wall, Steve closes one eye and squints, giving it a firm prod. When it doesn\u2019t so much as shift or complain, he sighs, splaying his hand out against the flesh of the gate.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Distant, he hears Wayne complain about his obvious lack of planning, sees him shuffle around the trailer, packing up supplies, and tinned food. His grumbles fall on deaf ears, fed to Steve through a small funnel of noise, his brain entirely consumed by a ferocious <em> buzzing. </em> A swarm, a polyphony of damp, cool organs and agencies <em> speaking </em> to him, <em> welcoming </em>him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Steve is a key to a lock Eleven forged through blood, sweat and tears.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Faintly, Mike\u2019s insistence that this sounded like a trap begins to ring true.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>But when the flesh begins to part, curling in on itself to open the partition to the hellscape above or beneath them, Steve abandons all sense. Any scrap of logical thinking he was still capable of is dead and buried, because the gate just opened <em> for </em>him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><em> For </em>him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It\u2019s not right\u2014it\u2019s grotesque, a visceral sensation in his gut as the Upside Down whispers to him in <em> greeting, </em>a mangled reunion. The gate should not open, not like this, not so easily. The bite wounds climbing his side like ivy on cobblestone ripple, chirping in some malformed communication. Flesh to flesh.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWayne,\u201d Steve coughs out, trying to draw his focus away from the intoxicating lull of the gate, the gradually exposed dimension unraveling before them. \u201cIt\u2019s\u2014not meant to do that,\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The man shifts closer to him, brow furrowed in one deep, jagged line across his forehead. \u201cAin\u2019t nothin\u2019 right about that goddamn thing, Steve, boy.\u201d It looks like he might even ask him to get down off the chair, one hand reaching to jostle the sleeve of Steve\u2019s thick army jacket, but quickly that becomes futile.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Just like the sudden peril that was Lover\u2019s Lake, Steve\u2019s only warning of danger was Wayne\u2019s loose grasp turning into a deadlock grip around his one wrist, the other <em> pulsing </em>as the flesh of a vine coiled around the bone of the other.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The pound of writhing flesh pulls taut, and <em> heaves, </em> finding no struggle in taking the combined weight of Steve and Wayne up and <em> through </em> the gate, no mattress on the other side to save them from the impact on the other side. Steve hears Wayne <em> groan, </em>a flash of hot guilt curling in his gut\u2014but he hadn\u2019t the time to dwell, because the vine doesn\u2019t stop now they\u2019re stuck on the other side.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>No, it only grows more <em> wild, </em>drawing a sharp yell of surprise out of Steve when it blasts through the plaster of the Upside Down\u2019s equivalent to the Munson trailer, determined to drag him with it.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wayne\u2019s grip on him falters, the flesh snatching Steve from his grip in an action all too reminiscent of the time before, sprawled out on his back as the malformed version of the trailer park travels by him in a swift, snakelike whip of predatory retrieval.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Managing to snag his hand on the oxidized metal of the gates to the park, Steve bites back the cry he desperately wants to heave out, the wiring cutting into the flesh of his fingers as he fights the strength of the vine for just a second longer.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>This moment\u2014the jagged second in which he halts the relentless drag of the vine\u2014is when Steve is taught a valuable lesson. Do <em> not </em>underestimate Wayne Munson.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Because with an iron grip of determination forged into his expression, Wayne pounds across the trailer park grounds, body sharp and limber. He moves with practice; honed and trained, even if the tolls of time have roughened the edges of a careful runner\u2019s stance, dulled the end of the dexterous posture he travels with.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He\u2019s on the vine in a handful of crucial seconds, tossing his body to the decrepit floors of the Upside Down, rolling once and skidding to a stop. One hand drawing a blade from his combat boot, Wayne uses the other to gather the flesh of the vine in his fist, sinking his nails into the viscera and using his newfound leverage to stab down, <em> through </em>and out.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wayne severs the tail of the vine that\u2019s coiled its way around Steve\u2019s appendages, sending it squealing and wailing in a hasty retreat back to whatever creature it adheres to.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Steve lays flat on his back, shock trickling through to his major extremities as he attempts to let that entire sequence settle in.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wayne is staring at his hand with a vague interest and blatant disgust, huffing before wiping it on his pant leg. \u201cWell ain\u2019t this place just the picture of fucked up?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Remembering that in times where someone has just <em> saved </em> your <em> life </em> that it\u2019s generally good manners to thank the man responsible, Steve splutters, brain not reaching his tongue. Several different phrases flicker through his thoughts, most of them groveling or ass-kissing, not suitable for a man so gruff, so totally, surprisingly yet undeniably <em> badass.\u00a0 </em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Pondering once again over Wayne being Eddie\u2019s uncle, Steve comes to a decision\u2014what would <em> Eddie </em>say?</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThat was so\u2014so fucking metal, sir,\u201d It comes out wrong, definitely poser-ish, and the <em> sir </em>at the end just has Steve cringing, but Wayne turns and chuckles, offering a fond, brusque smile all the same. A hand is offered to him in an effort to get him off the ground.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been spendin\u2019 too much time with my boy, I can goddamn tell. Up we get now, son,\u201d Tugging him upright, Wayne steadies him with a hand on his shoulder, checks him over quickly. He seems relatively content with Steve\u2019s lack of obvious injury, clapping him on the back and encouraging him to walk. \u201cLead the way, kid, we\u2019ve got ground to cover,\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Several things stick out to Steve in what Wayne had just said, multiple worth mentioning, contending, dwelling upon. But in times like this Steve becomes blatantly aware of just how shit he is at talking to adults\u2014<em> older </em>adults, he corrects, because technically Steve is, legally, an adult.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Trailing after men like Wayne Munson or Chief Hopper, he really doesn\u2019t feel like it.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>All the same, Steve swallows, stumbles over himself and does his best to pretend he knows the way to his own house.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI, uh. I didn\u2019t get to spend a lot of time with him,\u201d Steve admits, glancing back at Wayne, who\u2019s adjusting the rucksack of supplies he\u2019d had the intelligence to bring. He doesn\u2019t have time to dwell on the fact that he hadn\u2019t thought that far\u2014Wayne is staring at him expectantly.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2026 hung with different crowds. At school,\u201d Steve adds, shifting Wayne\u2019s facial expression from bemused to straight up incredulous.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He spins Nancy\u2019s handgun on one hand. \u201cYou don\u2019t say, Harrington,\u201d Wayne says his surname like that says enough, gaze pointed. \u201cI think I woulda known if you were hangin\u2019 round my boy. Y\u2019father woulda taped an eviction notice to his head and sent \u2018im back to me.\u201d A scoff. \u201cAin\u2019t no way his Harrington boy would be hangin\u2019 with trailer trash,\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Mouth dry, Steve steps over a shifting vine in the dirt, Wayne mirroring his caution without a word. \u201cI would\u2019ve. Definitely, if\u2026 I\u2019d known him the way I do now.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so,\u201d Wayne says, though not maliciously. \u201cYour varsity pals woulda made quick work of him, no doubt. Boys like that cockroach, that Jason Carver lad.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Steve swings his bat lightly and idly in one hand, the urge to keep them occupied when uncomfortable conversations like <em> this </em>come to fruition unbearable to resist. \u201cMaybe in junior year, yeah. But, uh, after\u2026 after I fought a creature from here for the first time?\u201d He gestures to the sky with his nail-stricken weapon, chuckling dryly. \u201cEddie would\u2019ve been right up my alley. I\u2019m actually kinda jealous of him, to be honest,\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Though Wayne continues to have one eyebrow raised, his expression is softer, stance less tense when angled towards him. \u201cYou, a Harrington, in that nice, big house? Jealous of my boy?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Steve says, gently kicking a piece of rubble from his path as they edge into the beginnings of the forest. \u201cI know it\u2019s stupid, I know\u2026 I\u2019ve got way more shit than people could dream of. But Eddie, you know, he was just\u2026 <em> is </em> just, like, <em> him. </em>Crazy and loud and a total freak, and it\u2019s\u2026 really fucking awesome.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wayne nods at that, no harsh quip to cut through Steve\u2019s fumbling honesty. \u201cEd\u2019s a lotta things, but he\u2019s almost always \u2018imself, and he ain\u2019t got that from me. I was always a little worried, y\u2019know?\u201d He knocks his shoulder against Steve\u2019s as they make their own path around the Upside Down debris. \u201cYour types always gave him trouble. Sayin\u2019 all sorts, I\u2019m sure you can guess. I always said shit like\u2026 maybe just tone it down, Eds, give it up a little.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a grief to that, a bitter regret.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m glad he ain\u2019t listen to me all that much. If he is, y\u2019know\u2026 if he\u2019s dead, my boy, he died true to \u2018imself. And I know he\u2019d like that a\u2026\u201d Wayne looks Steve up and down. \u201cPreppy guy such as y\u2019self was lookin\u2019 to stray from his image a little.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>A shriek cuts through the thick, humid blanket of their whispering, stopping both Wayne and Steve short. They\u2019re stock-still, standing, listening\u2014Steve instinctively holding up one hand in front of Wayne.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The older man slaps it away with a grimace.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t think it knows where we are,\u201d Steve hisses, continuing his stride, though slower, footfalls lighter.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wayne chuckles wryly, shaking his head. \u201cDunno if I should be grateful that I don\u2019t know what an <em> it </em>is in this shit\u2019ole,\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Casting a pained look back to him over his shoulder, Steve gnaws at his lip. \u201cDemogorgon. Like, seven, eight feet tall\u2026 no face. Lots of teeth,\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIt got no face but it got <em> teeth?\u201d </em>Wayne echoes, face the picture of horrified fascination.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Shuddering, Steve resists the urge to gag. \u201cYeah, dude\u2014sir. <em> Wayne </em>.\u201d He gets there in the end. \u201cShit, like\u2026 it\u2019s almost like a flower? Opens up and man, you don\u2019t wanna be there when it closes. Pop you like a grape,\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cJust how long\u2019ve you kids been fighting these mother fucking things?\u201d If Wayne\u2019s hand tightens a little on the butt of the shotgun, Steve can\u2019t say he blames him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Squinting up at the sky, Steve tries to do the math, and gives it up quicker than he should\u2019ve. \u201cY\u2019know when Will Byers went missing?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, I know lil\u2019 Will Byers. Buncha guys from the plant checked round the ground just \u2018case he\u2019d fallen or somethin\u2019.\u201d Wayne recollects, eyes flicking from Steve to the red daggers of lightning in the Upside Down\u2019s sky.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDemogorgon took him, broke through a gate like the one in your trailer. I had no idea what was even, like\u2026 happening, it was just,\u201d Steve shrugs, glancing back down to the bat in his hands. \u201cRight place, wrong time, or\u2026 wrong place, wrong time? I don\u2019t know,\u201d The phrasing is lost, so he abandons it. \u201cI came around to apologize to his older brother, Jonathan,\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, I remember my Ed talkin\u2019 bout the scrap between you two,\u201d Wayne offers.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Steve nods. \u201cWent to apologize, and a creature climbed out of his ceiling and we fought it together. With Nancy, too. And it fucked me up good.\u201d Casting another gaze to the ruined environment of the Upside Down, Steve chuckles. \u201cHard to care about being prom king or <em> basketball </em> when you\u2019ve nearly died because of some monster from\u2026 another <em> world. </em>Everyone thought I\u2019d gone insane,\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>There\u2019s another indescribable expression carved into Wayne\u2019s face, one hand curling around the handle of the shotgun methodically. Almost self-soothing. \u201cI think some of the guys at work were sayin\u2019 they had boys at the school talkin\u2019 bout some King Steve Harrington losing the plot. Can't say I\u2026 blame you,\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wayne pointedly takes a step over another thick vine sprawled out on the ground.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Steve mumbles, struggling to look back at the older man. \u201cThen shit just kept happening. I ended up babysitting a bunch of kids, then\u2026 those kids went to high school and became Eddie\u2019s kids. And I was jealous of him, and shit, \u2019til I realized they need us both. All the help they can get,\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Clapping a hand over his shoulder, Wayne gives Steve a heavy squeeze, releasing him with a bit too much vigor, though well-meaning. \u201cThat Henderson boy.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDustin, yeah, man\u2026 he\u2019s like my brother. I always wanted one and <em> shit, </em>he\u2019s annoying, but. That\u2019s what it\u2019s like with a brother,\u201d There\u2019s a strange tension to Wayne after Steve declares that, a part of him wondering if he was Eddie\u2019s uncle through his father. If that was the reason Eddie lived with him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>If this went the way Steve wanted it to, he\u2019d ask Eddie himself.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSince Eddie, though, it\u2019s\u2026 not been right,\u201d He admits, trying to shift the conversation away from what he doesn\u2019t know about Wayne. The look on his face says <em> that so? </em>And Steve nods. \u201cI don\u2019t think Dustin\u2019s gonna forgive me for\u2026 leaving him. So I gotta bring him back,\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wayne frowns, shooting Steve a look riddled with disapproval. \u201cNow I\u2019m sure that ain\u2019t the case. It won\u2019t be for my Ed, I\u2019ll tell ya that. He hears you sayin\u2019 that kinda shit and he\u2019ll smack the back of y\u2019head so hard you\u2019ll see stars, son,\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>There\u2019s an argument on the tip of Steve\u2019s tongue, the constant threat of tears itching in the corners of his eyes. As he goes to try and explain to Eddie\u2019s only relative who cares for him just how Steve left him for dead, Wayne\u2019s arm suddenly snaps out, grabbing him by the scruff of his jacket.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Confusion swimming in his expression, Steve turns to question Wayne, only to find a hand pressed over his mouth.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a rustle. It\u2019s quiet, but there\u2019s a disruption in the rotting leaves just a few feet to their left.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Steve feels his blood run cold.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to run,\u201d Wayne says, still, under his breath. Steve can\u2019t tell him that it\u2019s fucking <em> impossible </em> to outrun a Demogorgon, not with his hand pressed over his mouth, and a part of him thinks maybe that\u2019s why he\u2019s put it there. \u201c <em> Now,\u201d </em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>They break apart, sprinting in the same direction but not side by side, zigzagging and snaking over foliage and the rotting corpses of trees, Steve thankful for his only additional weight the light wood of his bat in-hand.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Despite bearing the weight of the artillery and their supplies, Wayne is a few meters ahead of him, weaving and ducking his way through the Upside Down\u2019s deformed woods, looking back only to check that Steve was with him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>If he couldn\u2019t hear the frustrated screeches of the Demogorgon practically licking at his heels, Steve would\u2019ve been touched at the sentiment.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It can\u2019t go on like this\u2014last time they\u2019d been on home turf, the Byers\u2019 house theirs to manipulate. This was the Demogorgon\u2019s home, with every sodden footfall on the rotten earth they step closer to a trap they can\u2019t know about, a new monster lurking in the mutilated shadows of the Upside Down.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Some twisted fate hears Steve\u2019s prayers, because Wayne suddenly vanishes from his view, leaving no time to fret as they both take an unavoidable <em> plunge </em> headfirst down a steep hill, stumbling and then <em> rolling </em>in the rot.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Flares of pain jab and scald his body, debris and decay blemishing and soiling his clothes, skin, hair. He feels it seep into his flesh as he tumbles, the earth so putrefied that it bleeds into him, soaking every inch of his being until he finds himself gagging, unable to do more in the flailing panic of his plummet.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>His body comes to a stop after colliding with the hollow trunk of a tree, the sap bitter where it should be sweet.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>A quiet groan nearby offers Steve a minor comfort. Eddie\u2019s uncle survived whatever strategy the two of them had just mutually employed\u2014so he rolls onto his stomach, commando crawling over to where Wayne lies, splayed out on his back.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a calling trill at the top of the clearing, the Demogorgon shrieking and vocalizing clear dismay over losing lunch and dinner in one fail swoop. The way it calls almost sounds as if it wants the two of them to reply, something that could earn a laugh from Steve if he weren\u2019t almost entirely convinced the monster would hear and make sure they didn\u2019t get lucky again.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Though as he wipes the ineffable <em> muck </em>off of his brow, Steve can\u2019t say he feels so lucky.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIt can\u2019t see,\u201d He recalls, speaking only after ten minutes of lying in the grime with Wayne by his side. \u201cIt\u2014smells and hears. This\u2026\u201d Steve flicks his wrist, slick rot from the decaying earth dripping from his fingertips. \u201cProbably just makes us smell of\u2026 y\u2019know,\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cShit?\u201d Wayne offers, clutching his side.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Steve shrugs. \u201cI was gonna say everything else, but\u2026 yeah, that, too. God, there\u2019s nothing like an Upside Down shower, man,\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a pause in which Wayne\u2019s face just scrunches up, and Steve realizes he sounds just a little stretch past <em> insane, </em>one foot in total maniac.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s like\u2014I haven\u2019t been to the coast in ages, but when you come back from the beach all sandy and shit and you get to shower it off. Like\u2026 a beach shower, but for the Upside Down. Showering that shit off almost makes up for it being all over you in the first place,\u201d Steve explains, though the incredulity on Wayne\u2019s face only grows, wrinkling across his skin in distaste.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re a weird one, son,\u201d Wayne grumbles, dragging a hand down his face, trying to rid himself of some of the rot, though only really succeeding in smearing it further. \u201cI can see why my Ed and y\u2019self are\u2026 all buddy buddy,\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a pause, and then something warm blooms in Steve\u2019s chest. \u201cReally?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cGoddamn, looking at me like a puppy dog,\u201d Wayne grouses, shaking his head in disdain. \u201cAin\u2019t seen nobody so happy to be called weird.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bashful, Steve sits up against the decaying tree that had stopped his fall, bringing his knees up to sit criss-crossed. \u201cI dunno. It kinda felt like a compliment coming from Eddie, so\u2026 coming from you,\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIt weren\u2019t a compliment, don\u2019t letcha ego blow y\u2019self up,\u201d Wayne snipes, before a snarky grin blossoms over his face, stabbing cool relief into Steve\u2019s gut. \u201cYa definitely a bit goddamn freaky. But my Ed digs that, and\u2026 here y\u2019are. In the fuckin\u2019 gates\u2019a hell just to rescue \u2018im.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIf I didn\u2019t know any better, Steve, I\u2019d say you \u2018n my Ed were already pals. Ain\u2019t ever heard of acquaintances riskin\u2019 they goddamn lives in another dimension for one another,\u201d There\u2019s an implication, there. Steve can feel it, woven into the careful tone Wayne uses to navigate his sentences, shifting his tired body to sit beside him. The rotting tree acts as their buffer, a shield against whatever Wayne seems to offer him, cautious.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Steve thinks about Eddie wearing his jacket, <em> HARRINGTON </em>splayed between his shoulder blades.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, well, he said I was <em> metal </em>and\u2026 something about an Ozzy guy, so I think we\u2019re best friends, actually,\u201d He\u2019s joking, trying to ease the tension around whatever conversation Wayne is trying to brace him for\u2014but all he succeeds in doing is colouring a new kind of shock into the older man\u2019s face.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wayne blinks. Looking a little stunned. \u201cOzzy? Ozzy Osbourne? The\u2014Black Sabbath guy?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Steve shrugs, a bit listless. \u201cUh, yeah. The guy who bit the bat?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cMy\u2014<em> my </em>nephew\u2026 compared ya to Ozzy Osbourne? Truthfully \u2018n honestly?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Swallowing, Steve nods, the tiniest prickle of fear in his gut gnawing at him that maybe it was some kind of veiled insult after all. \u201cI mean, yeah, I\u2014don\u2019t really know what he meant by it, but\u2026 yeah,\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cJesus,\u201d Wayne mutters, pinching his brow. \u201cIt means my nephew likes ya a helluva lot more than he\u2019s been letting ya think, son.\u201d He fiddles with a flask of water freshly plucked from his bag, offering it to Steve, who accepts it readily. \u201cMy boy, he\u2026 I mean, he\u2019s practically in love with the guy,\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He\u2019s testing the waters. Steve knows he is; can feel Wayne swimming for a response, side eye burning into his peripheral vision.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOh yeah?\u201d Steve smiles, despite the nerves, and wipes his mouth with the back of his hand. \u201cHe cute?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Any remaining stiffness between strangers melts away as Wayne muffles his laugh with the sleeve of his jacket, his other hand reaching to aggressively ruffle Steve\u2019s hair, much to his amused dismay. \u201cGod, I can see the two of ya givin\u2019 me one damn headache when this shit is said and done.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll make sure of it,\u201d Steve says with his parent-winning smile, batting his eyelashes.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re a little shit, is what y\u2019are,\u201d Wayne stands, knocking back another gulp of water and stuffing it back into the rucksack, sticking a firm hand out for Steve to take. \u201cLet\u2019s go get my boy. He can tell ya how goddamn cute y\u2019are or y\u2019aren\u2019t when we got all three pairs of our fuckin\u2019 feet back on our turf.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Chuckling, Steve takes it, stumbling forwards as they set off down the steep hill on foot, a lopsided smile tilted Wayne\u2019s way. \u201cWhat? You don\u2019t think I\u2019m cute?\u201d He frowns, trying to look as affronted as possible.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wayne smacks him up the back of his head, shoving him forwards. \u201cShut ya damn mouth, kid, or I\u2019ll find another cliff to roll ya off of,\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>As they turn another corner of the decrepit, malnourished version of Hawkins\u2019 endless suburban maze, Steve takes a second to catch his breath, bubbling pain rippling up his torso in the scarred flesh of his bat bites.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>There\u2019s something wrong with them\u2014it\u2019s almost as if they\u2019re trying to communicate with the fucked up life here; remind Steve what could happen should he slip up for even a moment.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Hands holding his knees as he bends for just a second of aching reprieve, Steve glances up to find Wayne staring at him, one eyebrow raised.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re really\u2026\u201d Steve clutches his side. \u201cFast. Like, you\u2019ve got\u2026 serious form? Did you play sports in highschool or something?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a reluctance to Wayne\u2019s stance, like he\u2019s not entirely sure that\u2019s a rabbit hole he wants Steve to chase him down, but eventually he slows to a stop, letting him take a moment to recover. \u201cAre you injured, boy?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Damn, that wasn\u2019t the conversation Steve wanted to have, especially not considering just what injured him. (And just <em> what </em>killed Eddie.) \u201cNo, nah. It\u2019s just left over from last time I was here. It\u2019s all scarred over and stuff, ugly as shit but probably just, like\u2026 a ghostly pain.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cPhantom pain?\u201d Wayne echoes, one hand settling on his hip. The other points poignantly at Steve\u2019s side, where, unbeknownst to him, a large wet bloodstain has begun to climb up the fabric stuck there.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201c<em> Shit. </em> Goddamn it, fuck,\u201d Hands trembling <em> around </em> the area of pain as opposed to really knowing what he\u2019s meant to do with it, Steve flails, phantom pain becoming very <em> real </em>pain. But the problem came when he considered he really wasn\u2019t lying\u2014those wounds had been scarred over in ugly, discolored lumps and patches of skin. Mottled over his ribs, undeniably horrific to look at.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>(And Steve didn\u2019t look at them. He wore a shirt in the bath, and closed his eyes in the shower. He didn\u2019t want to see them and be reminded that maybe it should\u2019ve been him, could\u2019ve been him that went the way Eddie did.)\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Then once again Wayne Munson proves to be far, far more prepared for this than Steve ever was, despite this being the first time he\u2019s stepped foot in the Upside Down at all. Clicking his tongue, the man unravels a thick roll of bandage from his rucksack, stalking over to Steve with purpose. \u201cRoll your shit up, son,\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d Steve begins, but the sharp look he gets from Wayne in return is <em> definitely </em>convincing enough to have his fingers curl around the hem of his blood-soaked shirt and tug it up just enough to reveal the worst of the damage. The material gradually peeling off of the newly-opened wounds is enough to have him gagging with pain, Wayne\u2019s face contorted with a gruff concern.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAin\u2019t look fine,\u201d And Steve won\u2019t look, but he can feel, <em> feel </em>the flesh parting and pulsing in ways that newly scarred fresh shouldn\u2019t. It\u2019s wet and shifting, bubbling with viscera and mutilation. \u201cWhat the goddamn hell\u2019ve ya done?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>And that\u2019s the question Steve doesn\u2019t want to answer, because how can he even begin to explain that his injuries were the lesser versions of the ones that killed Wayne\u2019s nephew; killed <em> Eddie. </em>How can he explain that these injuries were what drew his nephew into his deathbed in the first place, Steve\u2019s failure dragging Robin, Nancy and Eddie headfirst after him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Eddie dived into danger to save Steve, and died in his place that same day.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It should\u2019ve been him\u2014the same mantra that\u2019s carried Steve to where he stands now, groaning softly as Wayne tries to get a better look at the mutilation of his torso, the wet wound blossoming from dry scarring. It\u2019s unnatural, and thus comes with a malformed sort of pain, throbbing and indecent.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It should\u2019ve been <em> him. </em> He should\u2019ve stayed with Dustin, stayed with Eddie. Steve <em> knew </em>the bats were dangerous, shouldn\u2019t have just expected Eddie to do exactly what he said because who would? Why would anyone blindly listen to Steve, Steve with his big mouth and stupid way of making everyone want to do the opposite of what he asks.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>By telling Eddie <em> not </em>to be a hero, he must\u2019ve made him feel inadequate. Must\u2019ve pushed him to try and be a hero.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Steve pushed Eddie, and then he died. And now Steve has to save him, because if he\u2019s too late then this was all for nothing. He\u2019s ripped the bandaid of grief off of Wayne, the kids, everyone\u2014taken that from them and if he can\u2019t get Eddie <em> back, </em>the damage he\u2019s done will be irreparable.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Which is why the bitter guile of self-hatred flows thick and fast through his body when he comes to notice he can\u2019t breathe without difficulty, when his chest is tight and he can\u2019t move.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He realizes that he\u2019s on the floor, Wayne having lowered him to the ground against a home rotting in the mildew of the Upside Down, trying to shelter them both. Steve feels hands on his shoulders, hears a steady thrum of a voice attempting to speak to him with little success.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><em> \u201cHarrington. </em> Steve\u2014kid, <em> hey </em>?\u201d Wayne gently taps Steve\u2019s face with the back of his hand, stirring some focus in the milky distance in his eyes. \u201cThere y\u2019are. Y\u2019ok, kid, it\u2019s\u2014fine,\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>There\u2019s an awkwardness to his attempts to comfort, though it still seems practiced, learnt. No man can raise a teenager well without knowing how to do so, Steve supposes, and Eddie has undoubtedly been raised well.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSorry,\u201d Steve chokes out, voice thick with panic.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d Wayne repeats, patting the top of his head. They stay like that for another few moments, balled up against the side of the house, hidden from any creatures that may spot them from the sky.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m <em> sorry. </em> It\u2019s my\u2014it\u2019s my fault,\u201d Comes the pant Steve musters, words slurred together a little pathetically. Shame brings heat to his face. \u201cI should\u2019ve\u2014been with him. With Eddie. He died because of <em> me, </em> and I\u2019m\u2014I\u2019m so goddamn scared he won\u2019t be alive by the time we find him here. If I\u2019m too slow, or too <em> stupid </em>and I\u2019ve\u2014I\u2019ve held you back,\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Anger floods Wayne\u2019s face, spiralling crotchety wrinkles and lines of frustration up the planes of skin there, deep and sharp. \u201cNow you shut your goddamn mouth, boy, and you listen to me,\u201d Jabbing one firm finger into Steve\u2019s chest, the man uses his other hand to grapple his shoulder, holding him firm. \u201cYou stop this bullshit right goddamn now, I ain\u2019t listenin\u2019 to ya talk y\u2019self into this mess. Y\u2019are a mess, kid, and my Ed would be walkin\u2019 in goddamn circles of frustration if he heard this shit ya talkin\u2019,\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Any further attempts for Steve to pipe up in disagreement are silenced when Wayne holds his shoulder and jostles him quiet. \u201cYou were there, son. My boy was havin\u2019 the worst week of his goddamn life, chased by the pitchforks of this town and you were there. You coulda left \u2018im to be alone, turned him to the cops and you ain\u2019t do that, you stuck by him, you fed him, picked him up and you fought by him even when they was sayin\u2019 he was a murderer. You lot you went and you found him and you made sure he <em> knew </em> that <em> you </em>knew he weren\u2019t no killer,\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wayne stops his brusque rant only to furiously scrub his sleeve over his face, displacing the tears that had gathered there. \u201cBefore you came to me, boy, I was grateful. Grateful that even if he was dead he died alongside people who believed in him, built him up and cared for him, people who grieved him. People whose lives he touched and saved,\u201d Taking a staggered breath, the man shuts his eyes for just a moment, heaving under the raw emotion of the conversation. \u201cAnd now ya tellin\u2019 me that not only is my boy alive, but that you were gonna come down to this goddamn hell place on your <em> own </em>with no goddamn plan and nothing but a coupla guns y\u2019ain\u2019t know how to use and a fuckin\u2019 death wish just to save him.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIt ain\u2019t your fault that he died. But it\u2019s gonna be your fault that he lives, lives a long <em> good </em> mother fuckin\u2019 life with people like you who care about him. And I know you ain\u2019t know how special that is to me, to him, but it <em> is. </em>It\u2019s just been us, son, for god knows how long,\u201d Wayne\u2019s hand curves around the base of Steve\u2019s neck, thumb rubbing circles there, anxious over the sheer spill of emotions between them. \u201cAnd now he\u2019s got that Henderson kid, \u2018n all his merry men in that club. He\u2019s got that terrifyin\u2019 gun-wieldin\u2019 Wheeler girl, that odd little Buckley, and he got you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Pulling the roll of bandage tight around Steve\u2019s core, Wayne\u2019s frown deepens with concentration as he pins it quickly. Then he stands, and once again, offers his hand down for Steve to take. \u201cUp y\u2019get. We\u2019re gonna find our boy, and we\u2019re gonna get you a goddamn doctor, cuz that shit ain\u2019t nothin\u2019 but gnarly, kid,\u201d He grins, fatherly and fond, when Steve can do nothing but quietly smile and take it, pulling him up with one heaving breath.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>They walk, side by side, shoulders occasionally brushing\u2014a grounding tactic, a reminder that even if they\u2019re in some hellscape, they\u2019ve got company. Despite his guilt, Steve finds himself grateful for Wayne\u2019s presence at his aid, strong and understanding and far, far too kind.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>They\u2019re on the final stretch of street before Steve\u2019s house when Wayne sighs, and begrudgingly admits after a long stretch of consideration, \u201cTrack,\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHuh?\u201d Steve says, lifting his head from their comfortable silence.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAt school. You asked if I did any sports, boy. Cap\u2019n of the track team. I coulda run laps around any of the boys back in the day,\u201d Wayne shakes his head in reminiscence, one hand stuffed in his pocket.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Steve scoffs. \u201c<em> Track? </em>That\u2019s a shit choice. You just run around in circles all day,\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI ain\u2019t takin\u2019 no judgements from a meathead basketball player now am I?\u201d Wayne gives Steve a light shove, who stumbles with a dry chuckle.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m just saying, out of all the more exciting options you decided running up and down was the one for you.\u201d There\u2019s a glint of mischief on Steve\u2019s face, the banter between him and Wayne striking a new sense of motivation in him; an energy to utilize through the corruption suffocating the air around them.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wayne rolls his eyes, folding his arms across his chest. \u201cI did swimmin\u2019 too, y\u2019goddamn shithead.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, yeah?\u201d Steve perks up, jogging a few steps ahead of Wayne so he can walk backwards, facing him with a grin. \u201cI was the swim team captain. Maybe if I\u2019d been born like, fifty years ago we could\u2019ve been rivals,\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Coming to an abrupt stop, Wayne gawks at him, disbelief sharp in his pointed features, raw and laugh-worthy. \u201c<em> Fifty </em> years? Just how goddamn old d\u2019ya think I am, ya little weasel? I\u2019ll show ya <em> fifty </em>years\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Raising his hands in mock-surrender, Steve relents, nearly tripping over the curb up to his house as he chuckles away, face scrunching. \u201cI\u2019m kidding. Forty years,\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cTry <em> ten,\u201d </em>Wayne grumbles, following him up onto the pavement.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cTen what? Decades?\u201d And Steve earns himself a swift cuff to the back of his head, Wayne dragging him back to mess up his hair even further.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Coming to a slightly stilted silence at the front door of the Harrington house, the two men let their banter fall quiet, laughs stifled to a stop in the face of the writhing vines that weave their way across the painted wood.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Steve takes a breath, rolling his shoulders. One hand comes up to play with his hair a little, trying to fix it even minutely from the definite disaster it\u2019s become\u2014earning a wry laugh from Wayne. \u201cOkay, Harrington, my nephew\u2019s still gonna think ya pretty, hair messy or otherwise. Bust that shit open,\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Face hot, Steve bites his lip, taking the handle of his door and opening it\u2014finding no lock to stop him. It\u2019s bent a little out of place, he realizes, assuming it to be the handiwork of Eddie.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>(Briefly, he catches himself thinking about how of all the places Eddie could\u2019ve gone, he searched the streets until he found Steve\u2019s house. Maybe he\u2019d been there before, dealing at one of his stupid parties. But out of everywhere in Hawkins, Eddie chose to hide at Steve\u2019s, finding some comfort there, arms in the sleeves of Steve\u2019s varsity jacket.)</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tossing his head back to dispel the hair from his eyes and thoughts of <em> HARRINGTON </em>spread between Eddie\u2019s shoulder blades, Steve steps inside the distorted version of his house, the mirrored halls and walls glaring back at him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019d say nice place y\u2019got, son, but\u2026\u201d Wayne looks to the vines slithering across the mouldy floorboards. \u201cY\u2019cleaner\u2019s been slackin\u2019 a bit.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Steve offers a wry smile in return for that comment, nerves pulling something in his heart too tight to find a better response. He climbs the stairs two at a time, yet slowly, the route to his room all too familiar.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>There are small differences, strange ones. The year the Upside Down stays stuck in offers a time where Steve\u2019s parents at least held the slightest scrap of remaining hope for his total obedience, before Christmas came and went with it their trust in anything but his failure. Trophies on mantelpieces, all for sports and speeches Steve had fumbled his way through, the words he regurgitated anything but his own.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The floral wallpaper is from three summer\u2019s before, just before his mother had another one of her more manic moments and had torn it all apart, replacing it with a clean, almost surgical, white.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>There\u2019s an old rug still sitting on the landing, though the soft fabric is drenched with rot and decaying at his feet.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Steve casts a glance over his shoulder, back to Wayne, who gives him a firm nod. An encouragement. <em> Go on </em>. Go in, see him, find him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The door to his bedroom opens with a soft, wet, creak.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>But there\u2019s no one inside.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>The only solace to Steve is the evidence that even if he isn\u2019t now, there\u2019s no doubt that Eddie <em> was </em>here.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>His bed is slept in\u2014covers shifted and crumpled with no attempt to make them back up again. There\u2019s Eddie\u2019s leather jacket strewn across the surface of Steve\u2019s dresser, half torn to shreds where the bats had fought through it to get to flesh. The chain and his belt hang haphazardly on the back of Steve\u2019s chair, which is tucked against the least-used piece of furniture in his room.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The desk. Steve takes a step towards it, features contorted by worry and a sickening dread. He passes opened cans of preservatives, which now hurl with rot and mold, festering on his floor. Stepping over Eddie\u2019s destroyed pair of jeans, Steve stops, taking the chain he\u2019d always had attached to them off of where it\u2019s balanced on his chair, coiling it around his palm.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He squeezes the metal so hard his knuckles go white.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Because in harsh, scrawled letters, carved into the wood of his desk\u2019s surface reads:</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em> VECNA. HERE. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Eddie\u2019s sharpest ring sitting just below it, scuffed and bent from its handiwork.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cVecna\u2026 that\u2019s the mother fucker who had my Ed killed?\u201d Wayne\u2019s voice growls from behind him, hand touching Steve\u2019s shoulder.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Steve can\u2019t speak. His throat is lined with glass, every forced swallow agony as raw panic throttles him like a hand on the neck of a bottle. He only nods.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Turning on his heel, Wayne storms back out of Steve\u2019s room, gesturing for him to follow. They descend the stairs in a tense hoard, the air between them thick with wrath and dread and a sickly sense that just <em> maybe </em>this was how it was going to go all along.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>On his doorstep, Wayne Munson takes Nancy Wheeler\u2019s felonious shotgun, cocks it, and flares up at the sky, rage on his face so hot it comes off of him in waves. \u201cLet\u2019s destroy that son of a bitch,\u201d</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>The Creel House is quiet.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Steve knows, as the bats perch, waiting, quiet\u2014not circling or diving or fighting for flesh and bone, that this is wrong.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It shouldn\u2019t be so quiet.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Mike\u2019s warnings are sharply tugging at the strings of his heart with every step Steve takes, Wayne rigid and seething at his side. Worry curls away in his chest like a woodlouse, defensive and helpless in the eye of the storm.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s too quiet,\u201d Steve says aloud, the bats only following him with their eyes, not even stirring at the sound of his voice.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wayne grips the shotgun in a fighter\u2019s stance, fury incandescent in his every muscle. \u201cSo he\u2019s a bad host. I don\u2019t goddamn care,\u201d And he kicks the stain-glass door open, bustling his way through shoulder-led before it can swing back.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bile hot in his throat, Steve resists the urge to throw up the last of the tequila sitting raw in his stomach, trailing after him like a kicked puppy.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll check down here. Go up, kid, holla if he\u2019s there,\u201d Then Wayne turns, taking Nancy\u2019s Makarov out of his pocket, proffering it to Steve. \u201cIt\u2019s loaded,\u201d Then he shifts something until it clicks. \u201cThat\u2019s the safety off. You run into that fucker before I get there? Shout and shoot, son, and I\u2019ll be there to blow his fuckin\u2019 head off. Y\u2019got that?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Steve wants to shout at Wayne, then beg him to stay close, stay together\u2014but the splenetic fire in his eyes keeps him quiet, pliant. \u201cOkay,\u201d He chokes, drowning in his own unease.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Watching Wayne walk away, surveying his surroundings and cautiously studying the corners of the room before continuing on to the next. It\u2019s militant\u2014reminiscent of the veteran he told Steve he was.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It makes Steve feel all the more anxious as he climbs the stairs, not even an inch of the miles of trauma Wayne has experienced and learned from. He doesn\u2019t know how to find the blind spots in a space, seek the nearest exits; not drawn to the miscellaneous items he could make into weapons like a dog to bone.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Steve fumbles his way through the Creel House, lost without his usual headstrong confidence, exhausted and bitterly aware of just how much he\u2019d destroyed himself over the past month.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Eddie isn\u2019t on the first floor. Steve knew he wouldn\u2019t be, and wishes he\u2019d told Wayne as much. If this is a trap\u2014and Steve <em> knows </em>that it is, there\u2019s only one place Eddie will be.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Climbing the stairs to the attic, Steve gathers himself on the final one, just before the door, hand shaking where it grips the handle of the Makarov. Just point and shoot. Point, shoot, take Eddie, <em> run.\u00a0 </em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It\u2019s simple.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>But when he finds the last shred of his nerve; pushing the door away from him gently and finds Eddie sprawled out across the floor, limp and <em> far </em>too still, Steve abandons all sense of a plan, throwing himself down to his knees at his side.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>His hair is fanned out across the decrepit floorboards, matted and beautifully <em> familiar. </em>It had always drawn Steve\u2019s eyes first; remembers looking at it when Eddie had pressed a bottle to his throat, admiring it despite the circumstances. He\u2019s pale, so white he\u2019s almost blue, flesh cold and stiff under Steve\u2019s desperate touch.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Eddie\u2019s wearing his clothes, <em>Steve\u2019s </em>clothes, the gaudy green-yellow of his letterman jacket stark against the dull tones of the Creel House, hugging Eddie at his wrists and blanketing his marred flesh.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a brutal, jagged line of scarring across his middle where the most fatal of his injuries had been, flesh melded back together again in a mottled display of broken, deformed skin.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He\u2019s beautiful, Steve knows, lacking the strength or will to hate himself for thinking it. He\u2019s so beautiful, but he looks dead. The life that had churned in every aspect of his ferocious being is drained from him, lost in the poisonous air heavy on their skin.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Steve presses his ear to Eddie\u2019s chest, delicate, frantic encouragement toppling from his lips desperately, as if his begging could tempt him to <em> live, </em>breathe.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>And though Steve isn\u2019t religious, he wonders if he should be, perhaps. Because he counts every single last one of his blessings when Eddie\u2019s heart whines out an unsteady, quiet plea of a beat, pounding away in his hollow chest.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cEddie?\u201d Steve whispers, chuckling in an act of sheer hysteria, paying no mind to the tears that roll freely down his supple cheeks until they gather beneath him on Eddie\u2019s silent face. \u201cEddie, hey, Ed,\u201d He splays a hand out across his collarbone, gently shifting him, willing him to respond to his touch, resist or move with him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Thick eyelashes part, slow and heavy. Big, dark, murky eyes gleam up at him. They\u2019re cloudy until the light of recognition parts through them like crepuscular rays, sharp and bright the way Steve grew fond for. Eddie\u2019s ineffable brilliance, the way he can only ever be <em> vivid, </em>alive, scintillating in his every breath and move is hypnotizing, captivating, and Steve\u2014</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Steve is surprised when a desperate hand grasps a fistful of his hair by the base of his neck, driving him forwards into a painful clash of lips and <em> teeth.\u00a0 </em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It\u2019s a bad angle, but Eddie isn\u2019t all that concerned, raising himself in a swift heave of sore limbs and radiant determination to bring Steve to him; against him. Eddie\u2019s hands shift to cup his face, pushing and pulling it with the rhythm of their <em> kiss, </em>the real, violent embrace mingling between them like a blunt sword, strong, yielded, unsheathed.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>By the time Steve finds the sense to reciprocate the two of them are tussling around on the uneven floorboards of the Creel\u2019s attic, a tangle of limbs and vehement foolhardiness, two stupid, dumb kids in the midst of hell\u2019s malnourished crevasse. They kiss like they\u2019ve been aching for it, starving for it, lacking the thought nor instinct to know better, question their timing or their place.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>But then Eddie comes to, shoves Steve off of him in a sudden spark of consciousness, terror and regret devouring the gentle curvature of his features like a rabid animal.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Steve reaches to comfort him, ready to console; preach of how this was <em> okay, </em>how he wanted this, wanted to kiss him and hold his hand and let him wear his letterman jacket, even if it took Eddie dying and coming to life again in his dreams.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>But then Eddie presses a firm hand over his mouth, eyes as wide as saucers, sharp with perturbation. \u201cStevie\u2014no, no-no-<em> no </em> , Stevie you gotta get outta here, man, <em> now,\u201d\u00a0 </em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Steve wants to tease the use of <em> man </em> after their entanglement, but the sheer aching horror pushing Eddie\u2019s body to the brink of collapse keeps it lodged in his throat. \u201cIt\u2019s a trap, Stevie,\u201d Eddie continues, trembling uncontrollably. \u201cI saw it, when he took me, Vecna\u2014you have to <em> go, </em> Steve, come <em> on,\u201d </em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Eddie stands, dragging him with what little strength he had to his feet, Steve stumbling, punch drunk. He wants to reach out to him, continue to confirm that he\u2019s <em> there, </em> he\u2019s <em> real, </em>the hand entwined with his searing into his flesh and reality.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Then comes a strangled yell from beneath them, a fleeting <em> bang </em>of Nancy\u2019s shotgun like a red flare, stark in the darkness around them. A warning. A promise.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWayne!\u201d Steve cries, startling Eddie beside him, who locks his arm in a vice-grip.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou brought my <em> uncle, </em>Stevie?!\u201d Eddie barks, voice hoarse and raw from the strain of his grave.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The question posed is quickly <em> answered </em> when a vine punches through the damp wood of the attic\u2019s walls, bringing Wayne with it before <em> tossing </em>him against the structure of the room. His body folds in on itself, curling with pain and shock, startling Eddie to part from Steve\u2019s side, skidding on his knees to where his uncle lies.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Steve turns to join him, to join them <em> both, </em> face stiff with horror as he finds the three deep <em> gashes </em> cutting down the older man\u2019s face, one of his eyes <em> gouged, </em>but he doesn\u2019t get the opportunity.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Vecna ascends from the stairs, hovering above the floors, the fleshy growths stemming from his back keeping him off the ground.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Burnt flesh upon previously scorched flesh is something Steve could have gone his life without seeing. It brings bile to his mouth, lining his tongue in a bitter sheen of illness, the <em> gore </em>of Vecna\u2019s very being a visceral abomination.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Half of his face is <em> melted, </em> one eye missing entirely, his body struggling to hold its own weight under the sheer <em> damage </em> Robin, Nancy and Steve had delivered to his physical form. As he moves, the pulp of his skin shifts in rolls of mangled, mutilated cruor, barely even recognizable as a <em> body </em>at all.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Then he rises, spreading what is left of his limbs, and Steve only realizes what Vecna lifting into that dormant state in this room <em> means </em> when their surroundings dissolve into <em> red.\u00a0 </em></p>\n<p>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>It\u2019s all <em> red. </em> The sky, the warm ground beneath him, the distorted reality Vecna has summoned him to an anathema to Steve, the atmosphere <em> writhing </em> with an undeniable, stark air of human <em> suffering.\u00a0 </em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Chrissy Cunningham\u2019s disfigured corpse is contorted around a sharp, fleshy shard just inches away from him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It breaks Steve from his disgusted reverie, seizing a cry of horror from his throat so violently he tastes blood, feels it pounding in his head, his ears, his limbs.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Nerves hot in his feet, Steve starts<em> running </em> , despite having nothing to run <em> to, </em> nowhere to go\u2014though it\u2019s futile, only earning him a wet, mangled <em> laugh </em>from Vecna. It\u2019s cruel, the delight he finds as he toys with Steve; captures him by the neck the way the first demobat had, cutting off his panicked gasps for air as the tendril coils around his throat, squeezing.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Steve\u2019s back hits a garish, flesh-like growth, sharp and tall, similar to the one holding Chrissy Cunningham nearby, Patrick McKinney across the way, Fred Benson to his far right. It\u2019s a grave, Steve realizes as the growth leaves him suffocating, pulls frantic tears from his eyes, undeterred by the weak clawing he musters despite his oxygen-starved brain.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Vecna lurches towards him, stopping just inches away\u2014so Steve can <em> smell </em> his scorched flesh, the vine around his throat loosening just enough to force a <em> gag </em>out of him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy\u2026 so <em> disgusted, </em> Steve?\u201d Vecna\u2019s mutilated claw draws blood from his cheek, cutting where he pretends to <em> caress. </em> \u201cThis is your\u2026 <em> handiwork. </em> Nancy Wheeler may have\u2026 dealt the strongest blows, but it was you, <em> Steve, </em>who threw the first of them,\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>If Vecna were capable of smiling, Steve would attribute it to the contorted mess of viscera he\u2019s faced with. \u201cYou should be proud,\u201d Comes the rasping whisper, Vecna\u2019s laughter trickling down Steve\u2019s spine like sweat, continuing to sink the length of his <em> claws </em> into the skin of his face, delighting in the way Steve fights to not <em> react.\u00a0 </em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIf we had the time, Steve, I would\u2026 enjoy extending your\u2026 <em> suffering,\u201d </em>Vecna soothes, dragging his clawed hand over Steve\u2019s scalp, forcing hot blood to ooze down his head, into his eyes. \u201cBut you have\u2026 provided me a gift on a\u2026 time limit, Steve.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>If Steve\u2019s mouth wasn\u2019t painfully dry, he\u2019d spit in Vecna\u2019s fleshy fucking excuse for a face.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Instead, he rasps, writhing in his grip, \u201cWhat the\u2014fuck are you, even\u2026 <em> talking </em>about, you\u2014\u201d Then the tendril tightens again.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Clearly Vecna had no intentions of Steve talking in this confrontation.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m weak, Steve. You and your\u2026 <em> friends, </em> you\u2019ve left me like <em> this, </em> I can barely\u2026\u201d Vecna clutches the back of Steve\u2019s head suddenly, scratching a strangled cry of pain out of him. \u201c\u2026 <em> move </em> my physical body. And then Eleven, my <em> sister, </em>little... Eleven, she sealed my gates. Trapped me in here, away from\u2026 your feeble minds\u2026\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd then I felt it,\u201d Vecna\u2019s mouth opens, stretching the gore of his remaining face. \u201cFelt <em> you, </em> through the corpse of the boy, the\u2026 <em> connection. </em>Those bites you have, Steve,\u201d His claw cuts through Wayne\u2019s carefully applied bandages, sinking into the wounds from the bats.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Steve can barely scream, the pain so unbearable that he almost faints, choking on his own blood.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Vecna seems pleased by this, toying with the broken flesh of his torso. \u201cThese bites, once I\u2026 reanimated the Munson boy, I could use him\u2026 to play with your connection, push his living <em> nightmares </em> into your <em> dreams, </em> reach you through them\u2026 filter his consciousness into yours. Use him to <em> lure </em>you here, my final\u2026 victim.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIn my weakness, it turns out that all it <em> took </em> for me to resolve the win you all claim to have taken was\u2026\u201d Vecna\u2019s voice is repulsive, though it\u2019s only a minor contributing factor to the way Steve\u2019s gut <em> turns, </em> twisting inside of him. What he <em> says </em> is like fingers sinking into his viscera, tearing him open from the inside. \u201c\u2026a little <em> stupidity.\u201d </em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThe bites from the bats, their saliva\u2026 contain parasites, parasites that live in your blood, Steve. The gates Eleven sealed\u2026 believed you to be a creature of the Upside Down, thinking you were stranded in the wrong world. So it opened for you,\u201d Vecna explains, chilling Steve\u2019s blood where it flows, though constricted, through his body. \u201c<em>You </em>opened the gate for <em>me.\u201d\u00a0</em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThat one\u2026 gate. It is enough for me to reach your world once more. It will be <em> mine,\u201d </em> Vecna gestures viscerally to the corpses strung up like pigs in a slaughterhouse. \u201c <em> Ours.\u201d </em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m doing you a kindness, Steve Harrington,\u201d Vecna hisses, blood from his mouth spitting against Steve\u2019s face, despite the way he writhes to try and prevent such a fate. \u201cI\u2019m making you my final victim, in all of this. Had you let me have Maxine, this would all be far\u2026 less\u2026 <em> difficult.\u201d </em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Then his claw unfurls over Steve\u2019s face, the vines sprouting from the mess of Vecna\u2019s flesh snapping taut around the rest of his limbs, pulling them at unnatural angles around the structure behind him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He sees it, now, sees it all.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Hawkins, divided in four by the gates, <em> fractured, </em> swallowed in flames and tyrannous <em> destruction, </em> those unfortunate to be too close to the origin points <em> dissolved </em>until they\u2019re nothing but mutilated, liquefied flesh.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The fourth and final chime of the grandfather clock; Steve\u2019s fate unleashing what Vecna had failed to do with Max the time before.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>His friends, swallowed by the Upside Down\u2019s collision with Hawkins.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Steve\u2019s voice can only muster the air to scream in some distortion of denial, struggling as much as the restriction of Vecna\u2019s vines allowed\u2014little to <em> none.\u00a0 </em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou could not accept the death of <em> one, </em> and your guilt and <em> stupidity </em> will lead to the death of the many, Steve Harrington.\u201d Vecna promises. \u201cPerhaps if you had <em> thought, </em> if you had stopped to bring <em> Eleven, </em> I could be defeated. But you are arrogant. You are the pinnacle of human <em> pride, </em> Steve Harrington. You are Prometheus and his <em> flame. </em>In your weakness, I find strength,\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Vecna\u2019s clawed hand spreads over Steve\u2019s struggling form, and one vine suddenly <em> whips </em> his leg too <em> far, </em> further than it <em> can </em> go, and there\u2019s a sickening <em> crack.\u00a0 </em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Steve\u2019s scream leaves him gargling on his own blood, feeling the bone of his leg splinter and <em> shatter, </em> his struggling unavailing in the face of his blatant, imminent <em> death.\u00a0 </em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Chrissy\u2019s corpse in his peripheral beckons him. <em> Soon, </em>it says to him. He will complete them; complete his collection, bring about the end of the world as it is known to the masses.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou won\u2019t have to see their suffering, Steve,\u201d Vecna vows, his violent thrashing doing little to deter his words of <em> \u2018comfort </em> .\u2019 \u201cBut they will all die because of <em> you. </em> Because you could not be <em> satiated. </em> In order to try and save them <em> all, </em> you have led them to their <em> death.\u201d\u00a0 </em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHe will never forgive you,\u201d Dustin is brought to the forefront of his mind, grief <em> ripping </em> into his features. \u201cShe will blame <em> herself.\u201d </em> Robin on her knees, screaming, <em> sobbing. </em>\u201cAnd what of him? The boy you have sacrificed them all to save?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Steve sees Eddie, cradling his mutilated corpse, having watched him die just as Chrissy had, helpless.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Grief is a harder drug than the sheer agony of his desecrated leg, high on the vehement distress of what Vecna promises, what he foretells.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou are what fiction calls a <em> tragic hero, </em> Steve Harrington. It is time for you to <em> die </em>like one,\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Vecna spreads his hand over his face, pulling his head <em> up, </em> his limbs <em> back, </em> forcing his body to the brink of <em> break\u2014 </em></p>\n<p>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>The world of red and viscera explodes from beneath them.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It ripples, reality etching into the hellscape Vecna had scorched into the walls of Steve\u2019s mind, the Creel attic flooding into the harsh scarlet skies.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Steve plummets, feeling his body <em> drop </em>and hit the floor like a ragdoll, useless, wanton. His leg lies beneath him, pointing in an entirely perverted direction, wrong, deviant.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He <em> screams, </em> bloodcurdling anguish setting his every nerve-ending on <em> fire, </em>too painful to find confusion in his freedom from Vecna, not until he finds arms curling around him, moving him despite his sobbing, pleading protests.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Then adrenaline washes over him in a sickly-sweet heat, the warmth of the body he\u2019s pressed against all he <em> can </em>feel, so he swims into it. Drowns in it.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Eddie\u2019s breath is hot against the shell of his ear as he pants and whispers desperate apologies and fleeting comforts.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It\u2019s in his arms that Steve comes to let the scene unravel before him like a carpet, a scroll.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It\u2019s <em> Hopper.\u00a0 </em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Hopper, holding a machine gun\u2014plastering bullets wantonly into Vecna\u2019s mangled form, flanked by <em> Robin, </em>who seems to have found a passion in the art of a Molotov cocktail, tossing them with a ferocity Steve cannot help but adore.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wayne stands before Steve and Eddie, a shield, aiming Nancy\u2019s shotgun that he makes <em> his, </em> the gore of his own face returned <em> tenfold </em>as he unloads a fierce sequence of gunfire into what remains of Vecna\u2019s head.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He declares, voice raucous with the passion a father has for his son, with every impact, that it was all for his <em> boy. </em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The artillery ceases, and then comes the final blow.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Eleven steps between Robin and Hopper, spreading her hands, those little, delicate hands\u2014raises the disgusting remains of Vecna\u2019s oozing flesh and brings her palms together.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It simply ceases to be.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Perhaps not <em> simply, </em> moreso in a grotesque <em> eruption, </em>blood and gore splattered across the Creel\u2019s attic.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>There\u2019s silence, for a beat.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The six of them stand or sit in the aftershock, drenched in the spoils of their win, stunned.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Then Eddie giggles, mildly hysterical, \u201cHoly shit. You\u2019re the girl with super powers,\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>And the moment is broken.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Eleven smiles, licks the blood from her teeth and wipes her nose clean of it too, babbling away about what she knew of <em> Eddie, </em> as if she hadn\u2019t just caused the creature of her nightmares to <em> explode </em>on them all.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Robin startles forwards like a deer on ice, her confidence in battle abandoned for the sake of grabbing Steve in a bone-crushing <em> hug, </em>subsequently reminding him of his mutilated leg. Despite his wail of pain, he forces his arms up, holding her, desperate to dispel the image Vecna had forced into him of her vociferous grief over his death that now would not come.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He holds her close, sobbing into the space between her shoulder and neck a series of pain-drunk apologies, ones she hushes, trying to speak over him to offer her own.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Over her shoulder he sees Hopper approach Wayne, clap him on the shoulder in his gruff way, likely trading brusque, coarse compliments over their mutual destruction.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>And then Eddie returns to Steve\u2019s side; smile wry and faintly affectionate, though it\u2019s tainted with exhaustion and a little guilt.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Robin releases him, though one of her arms stays taut against his back, collapsing against his side while Eddie kneels at his other.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI could punch you, Stevie, for making me see that shit again,\u201d Eddie says earnestly, reaching to caress the soft skin of his cheek, the rough palm of his hand a welcome comfort. \u201cDon\u2019t do that <em> ever </em> again. <em> Never </em> fucking <em> ever, </em>you hear me, fuckwit?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Steve can feel Robin nodding along enthusiastically in a passionate agreement, jittering beside him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI,\u201d Steve\u2019s voice cracks, startling himself. Adrenaline keeps his brain pleasantly foggy, his vision blurry and light around the edges. \u201cI won\u2019t. Promise,\u201d He\u2019s not entirely sure what he\u2019s promising to Eddie, but he knows it could be just about <em> anything </em>and he wouldn\u2019t mind all that much.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Maybe he says that aloud, because Eddie laughs, soft, careful, and brings that hand on his face up to tangle in his hair, pushing Steve\u2019s head forwards to kiss him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It\u2019s a nice kiss. A very nice kiss, and though part of Steve is highly aware of Robin sitting next to him, most of Steve is just happy to be kissed by Eddie in the midst of his <em> delightful </em>adrenaline high and the beginnings of his body going into shock.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Unbeknownst to him, however, Eddie uses his other hand to signal Eleven with a thumbs-up.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>And then he\u2019s <em> snatched </em> from the pleasant numbness of adrenaline when the girl spreads her hand and forcefully <em> snaps </em>the bone in his leg back into its original direction.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It seems everyone was in on it\u2014Steve\u2019s proceeding shriek of pain is muffled by the sleeve of his <em> own </em>letterman jacket promptly stuffed into his mouth by Eddie, his arms pinned by Robin so he can\u2019t thrash. Wayne and Hopper seem unperturbed, though Eleven appears apologetic, there\u2019s no regret on her face.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSorry, Stevie,\u201d Eddie presses a kiss to his temple, removing the material gag from Steve\u2019s mouth to allow him to pant out the pain, face creased with guilt and an amused exhaustion. \u201cIf we dragged you back home with your leg like that, they\u2019d probably chop it off in Hawkins hospital.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Robin gives his hand a squeeze. \u201cHawkins\u2014they <em> love </em> amputation, actually, and it would be so sad because you\u2019ve always said you have nice legs so it would be a tragedy, really, this is uh, a necessary evil, as they say, and it\u2019ll stop hurting when you pass out, because you <em> definitely </em>look like you\u2019re about to pass out, Steve, but take this as like\u2014karma for, for just running off into the Upside Down without us,\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cShe\u2019s right,\u201d Hopper crouches down by Steve, ignoring his whimpers when he uses Nancy\u2019s shotgun as a splint for his leg, giving him a <em> look. </em> \u201cMike wanted me to tell you he waited <em> ten </em>minutes, not twenty. And you\u2019re goddamn lucky he did kid. Those ten minutes saved your life.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Eleven nods along at her father\u2019s words, arms folded tight across her chest. \u201cFriends do not do things alone, Steve. We are your friends.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>If Steve wasn\u2019t already being pulled down into the tempting promise of unconsciousness as Robin predicted, he\u2019d be groveling away\u2014but all he can muster for now is a sleepy nod to their scolding, head rolling back to rest against Eddie\u2019s chest.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>As darkness swims over his vision in droves, he hears Wayne move to offer Hopper a hand, the other giving Steve\u2019s shoulder a careful squeeze. That squeeze says <em> you did good, kid. </em>That squeeze promises that it\u2019ll be alright\u2014they\u2019ll take it from here.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cLet\u2019s get our boys home, Jim,\u201d</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>Hawkins adjusts to not only their police chief returning from the dead, but now the town pariah, too.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Free to roam the streets, the police force is quick to remind everyone that Eddie Munson was cleared of all involvement, quick to spread the news of <em> Henry Creel, </em>and to set their government-assigned story straight.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Eddie Munson enjoys the most of his newfound freedom <em> and </em>life, bothering Steve Harrington.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Steve\u2019s recovery is slow, arduous. Physical therapy becomes his worst enemy, his leg refusing to <em> move </em>like it should, like it had done before. He\u2019s frustrated a lot of the time, exhausted the rest of it\u2014but when he has to relearn how to walk, Eddie is always there to hold his hand.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>His presence is a comfort, a constant.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He\u2019s not the only one, either.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Where Steve\u2019s family don\u2019t come at all, Wayne Munson seems to dedicate himself to filling their gaps, frequently appearing in the hospital room to entertain Steve and his nephew with a lecture or three. He\u2019s got a patch for his missing eye, Eddie\u2019s pirate jokes <em> insufferable </em>but also a part of that consistency about him Steve can\u2019t help but adore.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The Munsons come together with Dustin to form a strange family unit, Claudia Henderson even visiting to deliver them all homemade food to make up for the <em> atrocities </em>of Hawkins\u2019 hospital meals.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>(Steve\u2019s also <em> half </em>convinced that it eventually becomes an excuse for her to see Wayne. He\u2019s not all that offended.)</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Dustin was another piece in the puzzle of Steve\u2019s slow journey to recovery, slotting in place like they\u2019d never parted at all. He\u2019d been waiting for them in the Munson trailer, held back from following them into the Upside Down only by a very <em> firm </em>Joyce Byers.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Steve had witnessed the reunion of Eddie and Dustin in one of his passing moments of consciousness, the brotherhood between them no longer stirring sickly, bitter jealousy in him. No, when Dustin and Eddie make up for their lost time these days through DnD, disastrous science projects and a determination to read the entirety of Lord of the Rings to Steve in his hospital bed\u2014all he can feel is hopelessly fond.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>His other most frequent visitors are two people he\u2019d deem the most <em> unlikely\u2014 </em>Max and Mike.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>His apology to Max for what was undeniably a reliance on alcohol all-too-familiar to her had left them both in tears, resulting in a pact to <em> never </em>speak of it when the redhead had clambered onto the bed to give Steve a proper hug.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Mike\u2019s visits were coloured by I-told-you-so\u2019s and the cool air of serious <em> relief </em> he exuded, eventually working up to telling Steve that even if he was a total <em> moron, </em>he was glad that at least he had the gall to be stupid and alive. It was a bridge, something in their bond finally clicking into place the way it had with the other kids.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The other kids\u2014Lucas, <em> Jesus. </em>Steve loved that kid, loved his patience when Steve could finally get on his feet again, when he\u2019d come with him every morning to the basketball court. Make sure Steve kept his leg moving, even though he was slow and totally shit at the game now, Lucas never rubbed his face in it. He had the patience of a saint, and could often be the only reason Steve had to force himself out of bed in the morning in the latter half of his recovery.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Will was still painfully shy, but when Jonathan would come for his regularly scheduled welfare-checks, he\u2019d tag along, find something exciting to chatter away about to take Steve\u2019s mind off of everything else.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It was nice\u2014nice enough that he eventually wore him down, getting Steve to agree to let him make a character sheet for an upcoming campaign of his. Will could tell he had <em> no </em>idea what any of it meant, but was never mean about it.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>El wasn\u2019t as common company as the others, at least not on her own\u2014she would be with Hopper or the Party as a whole. But when she did come to see Steve, she\u2019d bring pre-microwaved eggos, and would use her powers to take the pressure off of his leg despite his assurances that she really didn\u2019t have to.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Nancy was <em> furious </em>with him, ardently refusing to see him for the first month of his hospital stay\u2014but Robin assured him that she\u2019d visit when he was asleep anyway, despite his breaking and entering. The two of them were close, now, almost suspiciously so\u2014but when Jonathan didn\u2019t seem all that upset about the girls holding hands all the time, Steve decided the topic was best left to be broached by someone other than him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>(Nancy does, in the end. Tells him he can\u2019t be mad about his ex dating his best friend, jokingly claims it to be revenge for stealing her guns. Steve promises he doesn\u2019t mind, but gives her the shovel talk over Robin for the sake of it.)\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>His recovery wasn\u2019t the only one happening, anyway, not after the complications that came with being taken back from the grave. To Hawkins hospital, Eddie is a total <em> enigma, </em>one the lab has to fork out several thousand of hush money to fund his treatment.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Eddie claims that <em> actually </em> most of <em> both </em>of their recovery was funded by him, or occasionally Argyle. The running joke was that weed was the one true healer\u2014ironically, it did actually help Steve with the chronic pain in his leg, but he didn\u2019t need that as an excuse. Not with an ex-drug dealer for a boyfriend.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><em> Boyfriend. </em> What a word\u2014a word Steve couldn\u2019t stop <em> using. </em>It was addictive, and the only person who could understand his giddiness was his better half, Robin, utterly obsessed with the fact that Steve\u2019s stupidity had helped push her to win Nancy Wheeler as a girlfriend.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>(\u201cIt helped that you were a shitty boyfriend. You really lowered her standards.\u201d)</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>(\u201cAnything for you, Robin.\u201d)</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>She was living her own love story, one Steve could absolutely understand, having lived it in another life himself. It <em> didn\u2019t </em>mean that he wanted to hear every extended ramble about Nancy\u2019s every minor quirk and breath taken at their shifts at Family Video, but thankfully in his time at the hospital, Keith had been bribed into taking on another employee.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>That being one Eddie Munson.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Robin had promised that the ladies loved a bad boy, and a mysterious one, too. The Steve Eddie combination once discharged from the loving embrace of Hawkins hospital would be <em> unmatched.\u00a0 </em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Mostly Eddie\u2019s addition to Family Video meant there was someone to sort the horror films properly, someone to go with Steve to the back room and make sure he <em> definitely </em> wasn\u2019t all that scared. Eddie became an integral part of their work life, the trio to end all duos, and actually seemed to <em> enjoy </em>working there.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>So back when the hospital declared Steve sufficiently healed enough to be discharged permanently from their physical therapy program\u2014he really shouldn\u2019t have been surprised when Wayne had Eddie\u2019s van parked in the lot, waiting with bags of Steve\u2019s stuff to take back to the trailer park.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>They\u2019d pooled together their savings from work to buy another\u2014parked it beside the one the government had reluctantly replaced. No gate in the ceiling, fresh, new. Comfortably cramped.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Eddie frequented both trailers, one for Wayne and the other in Steve\u2019s name\u2014he was happy to frolick between both, though typically ended up curled around Steve come nighttime, sleeping tangled up with him in a gangly pile of limbs.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Being opposite Max was nice, too. Because if her mom ever had more of a troubled evening, she\u2019d take the pullout couch in Steve\u2019s living space, or knock on his window if she had a nightmare.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>A lot of time was spent, Eddie, Max and Steve, sat in the grass stargazing in the odd hours of the morning when Vecna\u2019s transgressions kept them wide-awake.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>On the worst nights they\u2019d sleep there, sprawled out in the grass\u2014woken up by Wayne returning from his night shift, or Max\u2019s mom on her way to her workplace.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>But mostly the best thing about living in the trailer park was <em> Eddie. </em> Alive, vibrant, <em> insane. </em> Every morning Steve woke up and wanted to say a thousand prayers to whatever force had pushed him into his life through tragedy and let them come out of it relatively <em> okay.\u00a0 </em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Every time Steve couldn\u2019t move his leg for the stiffness, the agony in his joints, Eddie would sweep him off his feet and <em> remind </em>him. He\u2019d be there and Steve wouldn\u2019t feel it anymore, the sheer relief of Eddie being with him, Eddie not just his one failure\u2014it was intoxicating. Overwhelming in the best kind of way.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It brings them to now, lying on the soft space of their bed, one hand casting through Eddie\u2019s hair while he listens to the mixtape made for him\u2014Steve\u2019s mixtape that Eddie would\u2019ve played to save him from Vecna.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s a shitton of Tears for Fears on there, Stevie, I hope you know just how much of my sanity I sacrificed making it,\u201d Eddie teases, tracing the shape of Steve\u2019s nose with his fingertip.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Steve\u2019s smile is lopsided on his face, sloppy in his fondness. \u201cYou\u2019re so goddamn whiny. It\u2019s not my fault your taste is shit,\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah? My taste is shit?\u201d Eddie jostles Steve lightly, pointedly raising his eyebrows when he rolls him onto his back.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Scoffing, Steve realizes <em> just </em>how much he walked into that one. \u201cYou\u2019re lucky I love you, asshole,\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah? Am I?\u201d Eddie\u2019s nose scrunches, hands coming up to squish Steve\u2019s face. \u201cI think I\u2019ll find you\u2019re the one lucky I love <em> you. </em> I had to sit through your preppy pop shit to make that, you know. Agony. But I love you <em> and </em>your flaws,\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>They kiss, then, even at their odd angle\u2014something common between them. They make strange circumstances work, adaptability entirely <em> their </em>thing.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>(Especially considering their first kiss had been <em> incredibly </em>poorly timed, but nonetheless.)\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It\u2019s sweet, tender in the setting summer-autumn sun as it streams in through their bedroom window, warm on their faces, their tangling bodies. They toss and turn until they fit together just how they like, comfortable for Steve\u2019s leg, suitable for the way Eddie likes to keep moving. It\u2019s a learned practice, an unspoken language, though it can often involve more than one tongue.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The two of them steal moments like this, moments that make the pain and the trauma <em> worth </em>it, reinforce the ideal that Vecna tried to use to scorn Steve.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He would\u2019ve sacrificed any part of him to save Eddie. The weight of the world couldn\u2019t amount to the weight in his arms, now, the weight of him on his chest. Steve wakes up and breathes him in, goes through the motions of their life, the one they forge together, and knows that though they may never heal, at least their suffering forged a relentless good.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Then again, it also created endless interruptions.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cEw, gross,\u201d Comes the vindicated voice of Max, peering through their open trailer window. \u201cStop making out, Dustin\u2019s already started eating dinner,\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><em> That </em>gets Eddie\u2019s attention, rolling off of Steve unceremoniously. \u201cThat total shitbag!\u201d He declares, vaulting out of the window and stumbling across the grass to get to Wayne\u2019s trailer.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you coming?\u201d Max snipes back at Steve, hands on her hips.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Chuckling to himself, Steve pads his way through to the door of his trailer, opening it up as opposed to following Eddie\u2019s more flexible route. \u201cYeah, yeah, keep your hat on, Max, if Dustin eats all the potatoes again I <em> promise </em>you Eddie won\u2019t let his character live through his next campaign,\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cA fate worse than <em> actual </em>death,\u201d Max deadpans, linking her arm with Steve\u2019s as they walk across the way together.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>They step into Wayne\u2019s trailer, Max abandoning him to fling herself towards the selection of food on the table. Claudia Henderson is attempting to negotiate a truce between her son and Eddie, who seems vindicated by the large portion of casserole Dustin has taken from the bowl. Wayne is watching, amused, though using the distraction as a means of taking more of his share in the red meats of the food, fixing Steve an eyebrow raise, as if daring him to challenge his authority.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Steve doesn\u2019t. He just smiles, shaking his head fondly before pulling up a chair\u2014glad to all heavens that <em> this </em> is how he ended up spending his summer.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>(And many more summers to come, too.)\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>"
