  "notes": "<p>This... this is a monster. It ran away from me. I don't even know how close I got it to what the OP wanted but it is a monster anyway. Written for <a href=\"http://daredevilkink.dreamwidth.org/5006.html?thread=9254542#cmt9254542\" rel=\"nofollow\">this</a> prompt and the Repost Madness Challenge. </p>\n<p>I'm throwing this chapter up today, so I make the (now defunct) due date of the 15th. I have an epilogue of sorts I'm working on that should be up by the 18th or the 20th. </p>\n<p>Thanks to PipMer for betaing, and Zwaluw for their betaing but also their cheerleading, poking and ableism check. I wouldn't have managed this monster without you guys. </p>\n<p><b>WARNING:</b> This deals pretty heavily with various issues of ableism. A few times the 'R' word is used. I've tried to be as careful and respectful as I can be but I'm not disabled and if I've screwed up, I apologise in advance.</p>\n<p>The Avengers also don't come off so great in this fic. It's a fic about ableism and they're the ones stuck in an ableist world view - even when they do get it, they screw up. We all do. I've done everything in my power to keep them in character and this is, in my opinion, their in-character reactions.</p>\n<p><b>EDIT</b> The AMAZING Badfinch has made a Podfic for this fic, available <a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/chapters/16309547\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>!</p>\n<p class=\"jump\">(See the end of the work for <a href=\"#children\">other works inspired by this one</a>.)</p>\n<p>Okay folks, I meant to have this up before season two dropped but I didn't quite make it. Either way, here it is, the (very long) epilogue. Very long.</p>\n<p>Same warning as the last chapter; I'm still an able bodied person and while I've tried to be respectful, I might screw up. </p>\n<p>But as this is the comfort almost, to the hurt of the last chapter, most of the ableism has gone - though some has stayed because we're all ableist arseholes sometimes.</p>",
  "text": "<p>Matt senses the arrow coming from nearly the moment it\u2019s released with the distinctive \u2018twang\u2019 of a bowstring. He instantly realises it\u2019s not aimed at him but the man he\u2019s currently trying to get a location from; whose stubborn refusal to talk has lead to the blood that currently coats his hands and the man\u2019s face; and the teeth littering the ground. The remaining human traffickers in Hell\u2019s Kitchen are actually better at their work without Fisk around.</p>\n<p>He also realises it\u2019s either going to be a kill shot or so disabling that he won\u2019t get the information he needs tonight. So he\u00a0does the only logical thing, dropping the man and bringing his sticks up to knock the arrow off course. It breaks from the forces on it as it hits\u00a0his\u00a0stick and he tracks the pieces as they fall to the ground around him.</p>\n<p>Carefully, he locates the archer by his breathing and heartbeat and tries to move so most of his body is covering the dazed trafficker on the ground. Unless this archer is exceptionally confident they - he maybe? Matt hates to jump to conclusions if he doesn\u2019t need to - shouldn\u2019t make another shot.</p>\n<p>The archer is exceptionally confident. The second arrow is in the air nearly before Matt turns around. Again he tries to figure out the arrow\u2019s path and realises it\u2019s <em>still\u00a0</em>aimed at the man at his feet. This must be the most confident marksman he\u2019s ev-</p>\n<p>Marksman. Archer. Shit.</p>\n<p>He knocks the second arrow out of the air and lifts his head in Hawkeye\u2019s direction. \u2018Are you willing to do this all day? Because I refuse to let you kill this man in my city.\u2019 Matt flinches internally at the slight slur to his words but the trafficker had managed a few good punches to his jaw before he subdued him enough to consider an interrogation.</p>\n<p>\u2018I wasn\u2019t going to kill him.\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018I don\u2019t believe you,\u2019 Matt says, easily picking out the lie in Hawkeye\u2019s heartbeat. \u2018I need him alive.\u2019</p>\n<p>Hawkeye hops down from his perch, the thump of his landing on the fire escape loud enough Matt\u2019s sure it\u2019s audible to the whole world. His next jump, onto the ground of the alley is nearly as loud and Matt grits his teeth. \u2018You are aware who he works for, right?\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018Just because he\u2019s Hydra doesn\u2019t mean I have the right to kill him.\u2019 <em> State sanctioned murder is still murder </em>, Matt thinks but does not say. Foggy can attest to his ability to argue for hours on the death penalty and he\u2019s not fond of the implicit legitimacy the government has given the Avengers\u2019 anti-Hydra spree, complete with resulting deaths. \u2018And he\u2019s my only link to the men trafficking women out of New York. I know you\u2019ve no care for individual lives but I have a duty to my city.\u2019</p>\n<p>With a sigh, Hawkeye moves towards Matt, who tenses at his movement. \u2018Hey, I promise. No killing.\u2019 There\u2019s no lie in his heart and Matt slowly nods. \u2018He dropped his phone you know; it\u2019s right there.\u2019</p>\n<p>Matt narrows his eyes and nods. \u2018I\u2019m aware.\u2019 He heard it drop earlier but had ignored it, aware that while it might have information on it he has no way of accessing it that\u2019s faster than beating the answers out of the trafficker. Who seems to have lost his battle to stay conscious. Damn it. \u2018What does that have to do with anything?\u2019</p>\n<p>Hawkeye carefully picks it up and passes it to Matt. \u2018These guys are good at their jobs but idiots with technology. Tony keep complaining about it - and he\u2019s not wrong. Who the hell sets four, nine, three, seven, two as their passcode when they\u2019re a member of a secret Nazi group?\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018Four, nine, three, seven, two?\u2019 Matt asks, trying to figure out why that number has any meaning.</p>\n<p>\u2018Spells Hydra on a standard telephone keypad. Not exactly rocket science.\u2019 Matt hears the beeps as Hawkeye fiddles with the phone. \u2018And he\u2019s left a bunch of addresses in his notes. Will that help?\u2019</p>\n<p>Shit. Yes but Matt has no way of accessing it unless he gets Foggy or Claire to read it and that\u2019s only going to take time he doesn\u2019t have. But there\u2019s no way he can tell Hawkeye that. Not without admitting <em>why\u00a0</em>he can\u2019t read the screen.</p>\n<p>Time to see how his improvisation skills have held up. \u2018Probably. Any close?\u2019</p>\n<p>Hawkeye takes the bait. \u2018Couple. 41st and 11th; 43rd and 12th; and 40th and 10th. But 50th and 12th is underlined so that might be important.\u2019 Matt smiles internally at his cunning and nods.</p>\n<p>But then Hawkeye ruins it. \u2018Here,\u2019 he says, holding out the phone to Matt, \u2018what do you think?\u2019 Matt\u2019s half sure the phone\u2019s screen is facing him but it doesn\u2019t matter because he can\u2019t read it.</p>\n<p>\u2018Looks\u2026 looks right to me.\u2019 He takes the phone and makes sure to lower his head in a way that\u2019ll appear to Hawkeye like he had a quick glance at it. His next move is to shove it in his pocket, next to his burner phone. \u2018I\u2019ll check them out.\u2019 At this feet, the trafficker groans but remains unconscious. \u2018What are you going to do with him?\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018Take care of him.\u2019 Meaning finish the job from before.</p>\n<p>Matt frowns. \u2018No. Call the police.\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018He\u2019s an ex-SHIELD agent. I\u2019m not sure the police can hold him.\u2019</p>\n<p>Carefully Matt moves so he\u2019s between Hawkeye and the trafficker and close enough to make firing a bow difficult. He\u2019s not sure of Hawkeye\u2019s hand to hand abilities but from the way his heart starts to race, Matt\u2019s sure Hawkeye is very aware of his and is nervous. Good. \u2018I will not let you kill him.\u2019 Legal arguments come to mind and are instantly discarded. Matt\u2019s not trying to convince a court, he\u2019s trying to convince a single man. \u2018It\u2019s not right.\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018Says the man who was beating him up earlier.\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018But I didn\u2019t kill him.\u2019</p>\n<p>Hawkeye takes a deep breath then sighs. \u2018Okay. I\u2019ll call the cops.\u2019</p>\n<p>He\u2019s not lying. \u2018I\u2019ll know if you don\u2019t.\u2019 Before Hawkeye can reply, Matt\u2019s gone; climbing the fire escape and darting over roofs.</p>\n<p>For a moment he pauses and listens to Hawkeye make the call. Good.</p>\n<p>Matt never thinks about the strange note in Hawkeye\u2019s voice nor the unusual tick in his breath after he'd failed to read the screen. It was only a moment after all, and hardly worth noticing. Odds are Hawkeye wouldn\u2019t have remembered much about it anyway\u2026 if not for what came next.</p>\n<p>*********</p>\n<p>\u2018Daredevil.\u2019</p>\n<p>Matt nods at Captain America, trying to keep any of his childish glee out of his voice and body. \u2018Captain,\u2019 he says smoothly and congratulates himself internally. He\u2019s perched on the edge of a roof, waiting for the Hydra men he tracked to this warehouse last night to return and Captain America just climbed up the other side of the building to talk to him. It\u2019s a miracle he managed to sound so calm. \u2018Any reason you\u2019re in my city?\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018Heard you have a bit of a monster infestation. I\u2019ve got some skill at wiping \u2018em out; thought we\u2019d come lend a hand.\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018Am I right to guess a little bird told you about my \u2018infestation\u2019 problem?\u2019</p>\n<p>Behind the Captain, Hawkeye snorts. \u2018Little bird? Original.\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018I aim to please.\u2019 Matt focuses, counting the approaching heart beats. . Three; none of which sound slow enough to be the booming Thor or the raging Hulk. So Iron Man, Black Widow and one other? They\u2019re walking, almost silently in the case of two, but he can hear that two of them - one of which is still somehow managing to move quietly - are carrying something. \u2018Who else is coming with you on this\u2026 thing?\u2019 If they lie, he\u2019s going to refuse their help. But\u2026 well he\u2019s not one to ask for help but when it\u2019s freely given it might be rude to refuse. And, though he hates to admit it, he\u2019s beginning to think he could be in over his head. Human traffickers and gangs are one thing. Highly trained and well armed Neo-Nazis with a death wish\u2026 not really his area of expertise.</p>\n<p>\u2018Three more people. Ah, do you know our names or our,\u2019 Captain America sighs, \u2018media given \u2018code\u2019 names?\u2019</p>\n<p>Matt shrugs. \u2018Code names mostly.\u2019</p>\n<p>That gets a surprised sounding huff from Hawkeye. \u2018Seriously? Our names are all over the internet since SHIELD\u2026 I thought everyone knew them by now.\u2019</p>\n<p>Oh right, Matt had forgotten about the SHIELD info dump. He\u2019d been busy both with setting up Nelson and Murdock and beginning his vigilante activities at the time. Foggy had downloaded a lot of the files but Matt hadn\u2019t really cared; especially once he realised a lot of the files were photocopied images of actual paper files and would have required a lot more effort to read than could be justified for simple curiosity.</p>\n<p>Besides, Foggy had read the funniest and most interesting files he\u2019d found out to Matt. None of which had involved the Avengers\u2019 actual names.</p>\n<p>\u2018I didn\u2019t follow that too closely. Not exactly relevant to my work and it was quite a lot of things to read for curiosity.\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018Right,\u2019 Captain America says. \u2018Well we\u2019ve got the Black Widow, Iron Man and a friend of mine, Sam Wilson.\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018Sam wants everyone to call him Falcon,\u2019 Hawkeye says, a laugh in his voice. \u2018Says it\u2019s not fair he doesn\u2019t have a nickname.\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018Well it\u2019s not,\u2019 a man says, climbing off the fire escape. He\u2019s the one who was moving near silently despite carrying something. Behind him a woman jumps lightly onto the roof making nearly no sound. They\u2019re followed by a man, who can only be Tony Stark judging by the amount of noise he\u2019s making. \u2018I deserve my own code name if I\u2019m going to run with people as nuts as you guys.\u2019</p>\n<p>Matt smiles despite himself. \u2018Falcon, I presume?\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018See! That man understands code names.\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018I understand not wanting to use your own name,\u2019 Matt corrects gently and it gets a soft laugh. He rolls his eyes and tilts his head. Still no signs of life in the warehouse but he\u2019s certain they\u2019ll be here tonight. It seems to be their meeting place and they\u2019re going to have to meet to discuss all the damage he did last night. He\u2019ll be able to strike then.</p>\n<p>They\u2019ll be able to strike then. \u2018Is there a plan then?\u2019 Matt asks, cutting into Falcon and Hawkeye\u2019s fight over code names.</p>\n<p>\u2018So you\u2019re going to work with us?\u2019 Stark - Iron Man but Matt can\u2019t help but think of him as the name he knew first - says, surprise in his voice.</p>\n<p>\u2018If I don\u2019t, I\u2019m certain we\u2019ll just end up in each other\u2019s way. Is there a plan?\u2019</p>\n<p>Captain America steps forward. \u2018Sam and Tony are on air support, scouting out their arrival and making sure no one leaves. Clint and Natasha will start on the roof and work their way down, making sure no one uses that as an escape. And I thought you could come with me, to be the loud and obvious ground attack.\u2019</p>\n<p>It\u2019s not a bad plan actually. \u2018I\u2019m not usually one for loud and flashy,\u2019 Matt warns.</p>\n<p>\u2018That\u2019s okay. Cap is, so they\u2019ll all be looking at him. You can be all \u2018I am the night\u2019 and hide in shadows.\u2019 Stark sounds highly amused and Captain America only sighs at his co-Avenger\u2026 friend maybe? Matt decides he doesn\u2019t want to know and ignores them, returning his focus to the idea of a\u2026 a team-up really.</p>\n<p>This could work out perfectly. There\u2019s just one thing\u2026 \u2018I don\u2019t kill,\u2019 Matt says, a warning in his tone. \u2018And working on a team that kills is the same thing.\u2019 Hundreds of legal arguments jump to the tip of his\u00a0tongue but he holds them in, aware he doesn\u2019t have the time for it.</p>\n<p>Everyone seems to tense but Captain America nods. \u2018We\u2019ll hold ourselves back. Non-lethal force; except in self-defence.\u2019</p>\n<p>It\u2019s probably the best deal Matt\u2019s going to get and Foggy will kill him if he gets himself seriously hurt or killed working alone when he has this offer open. \u2018Then yes. Seems like we\u2019re working together for this one.\u2019</p>\n<p>Everyone breathes a sigh of relief and the atmosphere on the roof seems to relax. \u2018Thank you,\u2019 Captain America says. \u2018Okay, Sam, Tony, I want you in the air now. Tony go high, make as little noise as possible. Sam can you drop Clint and Nat on the roof before you go?\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018I can take Legolas,\u2019 Stark cuts in.</p>\n<p>\u2018Without making a noise?\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018Legolas?\u2019 Matt mouths under his breath as Captain America and Stark start to argue about how quiet Stark can be.</p>\n<p>Clint slides up to him. \u2018As in the Lord of the Rings? The archer?\u2019 The connection sparks in Matt\u2019s mind, though he\u2019s not sure how Clint could be linked to the elf from the book or the movie - he sounds nothing like the actor who played him and surely there\u2019s more to a connection than uses bow, must be like that archer in that book.</p>\n<p>\u2018Right.\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018Not seen the movies then?\u2019</p>\n<p>Matt laughs. \u2018No I haven\u2019t.\u2019 Seen no. But Foggy\u2019s narration had made what would have otherwise been a normal Saturday amazing as they marathoned the movies. He\u00a0heard every moment of it.</p>\n<p>\u2018Books?\u2019</p>\n<p>Is Hawkeye trying to bond with him? \u2018I\u2019m not much of a reader honestly. No time.\u2019 Not exactly a lie; Matt doesn\u2019t tend to read braille books due to the often unjustifiable expense and he\u2019s not had a lot of time to listen to any of his novels since becoming a vigilante. It tends to cut into one\u2019s spare time.</p>\n<p>\u2018Not everyone is.\u2019 Yeah, he\u2019s trying to bond. Matt nods and moves to crouch by the edge of the roof. He listens, certain he heard\u2026</p>\n<p>Yes. \u2018If you don\u2019t finish your fight soon,\u2019 Matt cuts into the arguing. \u2018We\u2019re going to miss our moment. There\u2019s a car coming this way and I\u2019m sure there\u2019s no one else using this pier but Hydra.\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018Right,\u2019 Captain America says, snapping into action. \u2018Tony take off now.\u2019 Stark is in the air a moment later. Falcon grabs Hawkeye and takes off too. Matt tracks them to the other roof and Falcon returns a moment later, to take the Black Widow as well.</p>\n<p>Then it\u2019s just Captain America and himself left, crouching out of sight on a roof. It\u2019s only then it dawns on Matt that Captain America took his word as absolute truth, without questioning him at all. He shifts, unsure of how to ask why.</p>\n<p>Captain America beats him to it. \u2018Where\u2019d you see it?\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018I didn\u2019t. I can hear the engine\u2026 if you focus\u2026\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018Got it. I can see the lights from it now.\u2019 He huffs in disbelief. \u2018Not even bothering to turn them off. They\u2019re not exactly stealthy.\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018There\u2019s no one around,\u2019 Matt says, aware of how empty this place is.</p>\n<p>Captain America nods, then hands Matt a small item. \u2018A comm piece. You can keep it or get rid of it afterwards; we don\u2019t care. But you\u2019ll need to be able to hear us.\u2019</p>\n<p>Matt doesn\u2019t need it to hear them - he can hear Stark chattering away on Captain America\u2019s comm from here - but he can\u2019t admit to that. He nods and slips his hand between the mask and his ear. Captain America does a very obvious head turn so Matt can get the comm in. Therefore he doesn\u2019t see Matt remove his hand and slip the comm into his pocket with his phone. He doesn\u2019t want anything in his ears.</p>\n<p>\u2018It\u2019s Hydra alright,\u2019 Captain America whispers as the car - probably a van - pulls up.</p>\n<p>\u2018How can you tell?\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018See how it says \u2018Home Hazard Intervention\u2019?\u2019 Matt nods vaguely, cursing that for all his abilities, he can\u2019t actually read writing on the side of a van. \u2018That was a SHIELD shell company, used for surveillance. A lot of these Hydra groups are using SHIELD property right now.\u2019 Captain America seems a little quieter but Matt barely notices.</p>\n<p>\u2018At least five guys in there,\u2019 he says. \u2018And there\u2019s another two cars coming.\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018Okay. We wait for ten minutes after the last car before we go in. Tony, you let us know if more come later.\u2019</p>\n<p>Matt feels like bouncing on the spot. He hates waiting but this will be worth it.</p>\n<p>Anything to get Hydra and their human trafficking out of his city.</p>\n<p>*********</p>\n<p>It all goes to plan, right up until it doesn\u2019t.</p>\n<p>Captain America storms in, his apparently obnoxious costume drawing the attention of the ten arguing Hydra grunts in the bottom level of the warehouse. Matt escapes notice as he slips in behind the Captain, knocking out a man on his way to the stairs. Above him he can hear the twang of Hawkeye\u2019s bow and the sounds of the Black Widow fighting her way through the few \u2018leaders\u2019 of this group. Matt\u2019s starting to think he\u2019s not actually needed here; they have this down to a fine art.</p>\n<p>They\u2019ve also not killed a single person since they arrived. He\u2019s a little pleased about that.</p>\n<p>Aware he\u2019s having no impact on this battle as Captain America is more than holding his own, Matt works this way through the shadows to a corner of the warehouse. It sounds\u2026 off, the noises of the fight bouncing wrong and a few steps over it tells him why. There\u2019s a trap door here, some kind of secret space under the warehouse.</p>\n<p>It takes all of a minute for him to open it and duck inside, down the stairs carefully into an empty room. He can smell papers on the desk to the right; probably important. Slowly he moves towards it, vaguely annoyed at the strong smell of glue and metal. What the hell are they using as wallpaper?</p>\n<p>But he freezes before he\u2019s halfway across the room to the desk. Why does he smell plastic? The gunpowder is to be expected; this must be their armory but there\u2019s an awful lot of plastic and is th-</p>\n<p>Trinitrotoluene. TNT. He can\u2019t believe he\u2019s taken this long to recognise it.</p>\n<p>And there\u2019s a ticking clock. Shit.</p>\n<p>Matt fumbles for the comm in his pocket as he continues his slow steps. He grimaces as he shoves it in his ear and starts to gather as many of the papers as he can carry. \u2018We have a problem,\u2019 he says.</p>\n<p><em>'</em> <em>Daredevil?\u2019</em> <em>\u00a0</em>Captain America asks as Matt grabs the last of the papers and heads back for the stairs.</p>\n<p>\u2018Place is rigged to blow. There\u2019s at least a hundred kilos of TNT here and a ticking noise.\u2019</p>\n<p><em> \u2018Got a timer?\u2019 </em> \u00a0Stark cuts in. <em> \u2019I could disable it probably, if there\u2019s enough time. </em>\u2019</p>\n<p>How the hell is Matt going to be able to tell that? \u2018Not sure,\u2019 he lies.</p>\n<p><em> \u2019Where are you?\u2019\u00a0 </em>the Black Widow asks. Matt focuses as he races up the stairs and yes, there she is, just coming to the ground floor. She should spot him in three, two, on-</p>\n<p>\u2018Got you,\u2019 she says, her voice echoing in his ear a moment later. Flinching, Matt pulls the comm out, glad it\u2019s small size allows him to do this with ease. \u2018Downstairs?\u2019</p>\n<p>He nods and she\u2019s down there in a flash. \u2019<em> Got a timer Stark. We\u2019ve got over an hour on it. </em> \u00a0There\u2019s a collective sigh of relief. \u2019 <em> And they\u2019ve got some very interesting wallpaper. Seems our Hydra pals have been tracking down Project Insight targets; there\u2019s lists of names and addresses all over these walls.\u2019 </em>\u00a0Matt flinches again, annoyed at himself. Of course he should have checked the walls but there wasn\u2019t time.</p>\n<p>\u2018Why on the wall?\u2019 he muses aloud, aware only Captain America is in the room to hear him. Or at least, the only one awake in the room.</p>\n<p>Captain America turns to look at him. \u2018Good question. What have you got there?\u2019</p>\n<p>Matt holds out the papers. \u2018Not sure. They were on the desk and I grabbed them and got out of there in case... well.\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018The bomb.\u2019 Captain America\u2019s voice is understanding and sympathetic. It sets Matt\u2019s teeth on edge. He\u2019s clearly jumped to the conclusion that Daredevil saw the bomb and panicked, missing everything of importance.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s\u2026 he\u2019s not wrong about the missing everything of importance part but it still grates at Matt that it\u2019s being assumed he\u2019s far less competent than he is. Especially since he can\u2019t defend himself; not without revealing why he missed the timer and the words on the wall.</p>\n<p>\u2018Something like that. You\u2019re going to have these men out of my city by daybreak.\u2019 Matt can hear how Captain America\u2019s heartbeat picks up at the cold tone in his voice but he\u2019s beyond caring. The ring of Hydra human traffickers in Hell\u2019s Kitchen has been broken and Matt isn\u2019t - can\u2019t - going to stay near these people any longer.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s out the door and on the neighbouring roof before Captain America can even word a comeback. But he lingers for a moment, to listen.</p>\n<p>\u2018Well,\u2019 says Hawkeye, dropping down to the ground by the sound of the thump. \u2018That was abrupt. What did you say, Cap?\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018I\u2019m not sure.\u2019</p>\n<p>They start to look through the papers - all about Hydra cells outside the Kitchen and therefore useless to Matt - and, realising he\u2019s not going to get any more insight into their thoughts, Matt leaves.</p>\n<p>If he\u2019d lingered a few moments more he might have heard Hawkeye noting out loud some of the oddities of his behaviour and linking it to a barely remembered observation from the night before, but well\u2026 he didn\u2019t linger.</p>\n<p>*********</p>\n<p>Matt\u2019s main police contact as Daredevil, much to the man\u2019s displeasure, is Brett Mahoney. If Daredevil needs to warn the police or deliver someone to them, he goes to Brett. Who then complains to Foggy about \u2018damned vigilantes thinking I\u2019m their, I don\u2019t know, Jim Gordon or something.\u2019, something Foggy finds hilarious. He takes great pleasure in relaying Brett\u2019s every word to Matt.</p>\n<p>But while Brett is the main contact, he isn\u2019t the only contact he has with the force. Daredevil occasionally leaves crooks in the path of police or will scribble down a relevant address and leave it at a crime scene. But unlike with Brett, Matt never really sticks around to see them get his \u2018gifts\u2019 as even months after the police purges he\u2019s still uncertain of everyone but Brett on the force.</p>\n<p>This time he\u2019s not actually sticking around to watch them get his note about the gang\u2019s headquarters - on the other side of Manhattan or he\u2019d investigate himself - really. He\u2019s just, taking a quick breather before going home. Getting his breath back, making sure his broken ribs haven\u2019t punctured a lung. Necessary break time.</p>\n<p>Foggy\u2019s going to be so mad.</p>\n<p>\u2018Daredevil left a note,\u2019 Matt hears one of the officers say, from his <strike> hiding </strike>\u00a0resting place on the roof above the crime scene.</p>\n<p>The other officer groans. \u2018Can you read it?\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018Can anyone ever?\u2019 her partner replies. \u2018I\u2019ll give it to Mahoney or the forensic guys when we get back. They\u2019re about the only ones who can read this nightmare of a chicken scratch.\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018I swear,\u2019 the other officer says, \u2018this guy might be able to bash shitheads up like no one\u2019s business but he should leave writing to those of us with the brains to spell Manhattan right.\u2019 Shit he must have missed the strike through of the \u2018t\u2019s. Again.</p>\n<p>This somehow gets a laugh out of her partner even as Matt finds his ability to breathe has suddenly been reduced again. Their words are nothing; they are water on a duck\u2019s back to a warrior. They are nothing. Nothing.</p>\n<p>They\u2019re not much different to what the kids - and occasional teacher - used to whisper about the blind kid behind his back. Like neat handwriting has anything to do with intelligence.</p>\n<p>Matt struggles to his feet and, as silently as possible makes his way home to where he\u2019s sure an anxious Foggy is waiting.</p>\n<p>Maybe next time he\u2019ll skip the note and just do the job himself. No matter how far out of his way it is.</p>\n<p>********</p>\n<p>Two days later Matt\u2019s out monitoring Hell\u2019s Kitchen - and it is not patrolling, not with two broken ribs and Foggy\u2019s stern disapproval facing him if he dares patrol - when he runs into Captain America. Seemingly relaxing on a rooftop, probably watching the lights of the city. Matt creeps up on him slowly until he can hear the scrape of a pencil. Right, drawing.</p>\n<p>But\u2026 why is he drawing in Matt\u2019s city? Since when does <em> Captain America\u00a0 </em>draw anyway?</p>\n<p>His heartbeat jumps for a moment before settling back into its even rhythm. He\u2019s spotted Matt. Silently cursing under his breath, Matt abandons stealth in favour of getting to the man as soon as possible.</p>\n<p>\u2018Daredevil,\u2019 Captain America calls out as soon as Matt\u2019s in what most people would consider hearing range.</p>\n<p>\u2018Captain,\u2019 Matt answers, leaping onto his roof as the Captain closes his book and slips it and the pencil into his pocket. \u2018Care to explain why you\u2019re here?\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018Call me Steve, please. I\u2019m just admiring the view.\u2019</p>\n<p>Matt rolls his eyes, aware the man can\u2019t see it. \u2018Try that again, without the lying please.\u2019</p>\n<p>Steve huffs a slightly disbelieving laugh. \u2018Huh. You picked up on that.\u2019 Matt just stares, waiting for Steve to get to the point. \u2018I might also have some files; from that Hydra base last week. Thought they might be relevant to you.\u2019 He grabs a bag that must have been leaning against the wall beside him and sifts through it. Moments later he pulls out a handful of papers. \u2018Want to take a look?\u2019</p>\n<p>Shit. Shit. Shit. \u2018Sure,\u2019 Matt lies, holding out a hand for the documents. He shuffles through them, nodding on occasion. \u2018Thanks. Can I take them for a closer look?\u2019</p>\n<p>Matt can hear the muscles in Steve\u2019s face moving as his expression changes but can\u2019t actually figure out what the expression is. \u2018Sure. I hope it helps.\u2019</p>\n<p>When Matt gets them home, he\u2019s not surprised to find they\u2019re a bunch of addresses of Hydra\u2019s targets. Useful to him only in terms of people he might <em> not </em> have to watch out for.</p>\n<p>Especially as three of the names on the list are Foggy\u2019s, Karen\u2019s and his. Making a note to warn Foggy and have him read over the list for something Matt\u2019s fingers - and thank goodness for the fact the lists are handwritten - missed, Matt goes to grab a few hours sleep before work.</p>\n<p>********</p>\n<p>\u2018If you\u2019re going to follow me, you\u2019ll need to be a lot quieter,\u2019 Matt finally snaps, tired of Hawkeye\u2019s ridiculously loud presence on the rooftops behind him. \u2018I could hear you coming a mile away.\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018Shit.\u2019 The man loudly jumps onto Matt\u2019s roof as he turns to face him. \u2018I thought I was being quiet.\u2019 He pulls something out of his ears and gently taps it. Hearing aids. Well that explains the noise.</p>\n<p>Matt\u2019s being ungenerous though. He\u2019s certain no one but he would have heard Hawkeye\u2019s movements. Guilt flooding him, he sighs. \u2018Your aids are working. I\u2019m just particularly hard to sneak up on.\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018Oh. Thanks man. Thought I was losing it for a second there.\u2019 There\u2019s a smile in his voice and a relieved sigh in his breath. Matt feels even guiltier.</p>\n<p>\u2018Are you following me for a reason or just looking for entertainment?\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018Can\u2019t it be both?\u2019</p>\n<p>Matt tilts his head, aware Hawkeye can\u2019t see his raised eyebrow. \u2018Probably not, Hawkeye.\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018Call me Clint.\u2019 There\u2019s an expectant pause. \u2018Do\u2026 could I get a name from you?\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018I\u2019ll answer to Mike if you have to,\u2019 Matt drawls, to match Ha-Clint\u2019s relaxed tone.</p>\n<p>Clint laughs. \u2018It\u2019ll do.\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018You\u2019re also very good at avoiding answering my question.\u2019</p>\n<p>That gets another laugh from Clint. \u2018That I am.\u2019 He fumbles in his pocket for a moment before pulling out a - Matt sniffs - phone. \u2018Saw you running and decided to come give you my number. Just in case you need it.\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018I don\u2019t,\u2019 Matt says, any previous playfulness or friendliness out of his voice. He turns to leave, trying to quell the sudden fire in his veins at the hint he might need help to protect his city...</p>\n<p>\u2018And if you run into Hydra again?\u2019</p>\n<p>That gets Matt to pause. With a sigh, he turns back around, holding a hand out. \u2018Give me the number then.\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018Ah. This was an impromptu thing. You got a pen?\u2019 Matt just stands there, \u2018staring\u2019 at Clint in disbelief at the question. \u2018Taking that look as a no. Okay then. Umm. I\u2019ll read it out to you?\u2019</p>\n<p>Matt fishes in his own pocket for his burner phone, even as he smiles. \u2018You don\u2019t know your own number,\u2019 he teases.</p>\n<p>\u2018Who does in these days?\u2019 Clint snaps back, but with a hint of laughter in his voice. \u2018You\u2019re not saying you do?\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018I have to.\u2019 Realising what he\u2019s said, Matt hastily adds, \u2018I give out my number a lot for work. It\u2019s easier to know it by heart than to have to look it up.\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018Clever,\u2019 Clint says before rattling off a series of numbers. Matt tries to fix them in his head but Clint\u2019s speaking too fast and even after hearing it twice, he\u2019s not managed to remember more than two.</p>\n<p>So he lightly tosses Clint his phone. \u2018Put it in there; that\u2019s easier.\u2019 Matt pauses then adds, \u2018Only use one letter and you\u2019d probably be best off not using C. I\u2019ve already got a contact under that name.\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018\u2019H\u2019 it is then.\u2019 Matt can hear the beeps of the buttons as Clint adds the number to his phone. \u2018Yours?\u2019 Matt hesitates for a moment then rattles off his burner phone\u2019s number. \u2018Got it. That right?\u2019</p>\n<p>Realising Clint is holding his phone out for Matt to inspect the number he nods carefully. \u2018Should be.\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018Thanks. I\u2019ll leave you to it then?\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018If you could,\u2019 Matt says before taking off for the nearby roof. Clint doesn\u2019t follow him, for which he is grateful. He\u2019s busy enough as it is without trying to figure out how to work with another person.</p>\n<p>But Matt doesn\u2019t hear the way Clint sighs as he leaves nor the start of his phone call.</p>\n<p>\u2018Tony? I think your theory might be right\u2026\u2019</p>\n<p>********</p>\n<p>Matt\u2019s barely been on the rooftops ten minutes when Tony Stark - in the loud armour he wears - lands on his roof. A part of Matt wants to keep going, to ignore the man and keep patrolling, but he\u2019s very aware of Stark\u2019s reputation as a stubborn son of a bitch. There\u2019s no way he\u2019ll leave Matt alone until he gets what he came for.</p>\n<p>That doesn\u2019t mean Matt\u2019s going to make it easy for him. \u2018I wasn\u2019t aware that working together once was an invitation for you all to bother me. I\u2019d have said no to it if I\u2019d known.\u2019</p>\n<p>A hiss of air and Matt can hear Stark\u2019s breathing. He\u2019s taken the faceplate off? \u2018Side benefit. We might be a bunch of loose cannons following an out of time icicle in a pantomime of a team but we get to bother each other so no one complains. Much.\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018And I count as a loose cannon?\u2019 Matt says, unable to keep the defensiveness out of his voice. \u2018I wasn\u2019t aware I\u2019d joined your team.\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018Matter of time,\u2019 Stark says, sounding absolutely dismissive of the mere thought Matt might want to stay independent. Matt\u2019s hackles rise and for a long second he feels like growling or punching or doing <em>something</em>\u00a0to express his displeasure but he manages to bury it. Barely.</p>\n<p>\u2018Is there a point to you being here?\u2019</p>\n<p>Stark nods and waves the briefcase he\u2019s carrying in the air. \u2018Yes and you should be excited.\u2019</p>\n<p>Matt puts on his most unimpressed look. \u2018I am so excited.\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018I hear your sarcasm and I am ignoring it because you will be excited.\u2019 Hisses fill the air as Stark fiddles with his gauntlets and Matt can smell the sweat the moment his hands are exposed to the night air. \u2018Because this? This is awesome.\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018It\u2019s a briefcase,\u2019 Matt deadpans. \u2018Very exciting.\u2019</p>\n<p>Silence fills the air for a moment before Stark says, \u2018You know, you\u2019re really a smartass. How did we not know this?\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018No one has bothered to talk to me for longer than a minute.\u2019 Not that Matt would <em> let </em>\u00a0them talk to him for longer than a minute anyway, but they don\u2019t have to know that.</p>\n<p>\u2018Point,\u2019 Stark says, pointing at Matt with the hand not opening the briefcase. \u2018Very good point huh. Movie night.\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018What?\u2019 Matt had heard about Stark\u2019s infamous tangents but it\u2019s one thing to hear about them and another to experience them.</p>\n<p>Stark sighs. \u2018Movie nights. Thursdays. Jarvis\u2019ll let you in, you can even bring the mask.\u2019 Before Matt can gather his wits for a reply or a thought, Stark opens the briefcase. \u2018Got it. And voila,\u2019 he says, holding out something flat. Matt sniffs and realises it\u2019s some kind of tablet\u2026 a StarkLet? Matt knows enough about the man to know that if it\u2019s a tablet, it\u2019ll be one from his company at least. Stark\u2019s too proud for anything else.</p>\n<p>\u2018A tablet?\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018Okay, the doubt? That can go now. I don\u2019t appreciate the doubt when I have something amazing for you.\u2019</p>\n<p>In spite of himself, Matt finds a smile quirking at his lips. \u2018If you don\u2019t like my doubt, you\u2019re welcome to leave my city and it behind you.\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018No - and good distraction there. Here, take it.\u2019 Curious, Matt takes the tablet and runs his gloved hands over the screen. \u2018Password is currently three three eight four five but you can change that. Fingerprint lock - and before you ask there\u2019s no internet connection on it so I won\u2019t be able to use it to get your fingerprints and identity.\u2019</p>\n<p>Matt has barely had time to form a thought let alone start to worry about his identity. For a moment he finds himself marveling at the speed of Stark\u2019s intelligence. Hearing about his genius is nothing like being confronted with it. Matt\u2019s smart; he knows he is but compared to Tony Stark\u2026 he\u2019s an idiot.</p>\n<p>Grimacing at the thought, Matt gathers himself. \u2018I wasn\u2019t worried about that.\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018Uhuh. You don\u2019t have to lie to me. So. What do you think?\u2019</p>\n<p>Matt moves his head so he\u2019ll appear to be glancing from the tablet, to Stark and back again. \u2018It\u2019s a tablet?\u2019 he repeats. \u2018I\u2019m still not excited.\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018Okay, point.\u2019 Stark facepalms. \u2018Now I know this might not look like much but it\u2019s better than like, everything on the market right now and it\u2019ll help with your little problem. Totally fix it which is a thousand times better than what most of the bullshit people are selling will. Probably faster than most things but that\u2019s not something I can measure.\u2019</p>\n<p>Something cold is creeping through Matt\u2019s veins. \u2018My\u2026 my problem?\u2019</p>\n<p>Stark waves a careless hand. \u2018Issue, thing, circumstance, whatever you want to call it. This should fix it right up -\u2019 he takes a step towards Matt then pauses, \u2018and you\u2019ve not even turned it on. No wonder you\u2019re so confused. Okay, here.\u2019 Before Matt can voice a protest, Stark tugs the tablet from his hands and taps at it, unlocking it with a click. \u2018There.\u2019</p>\n<p>Matt takes it gently and tries not to give away the way his stomach is trying to sink into the ground. \u2018Oh?\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018...Okay this is worse than I thought. Look, I get it\u2019s embarrassing but reading is, apparently, awesome and this is going to help you learn it.\u2019</p>\n<p>The coldness in Matt\u2019s veins runs into something warm that burns through his body and mind. \u2018Reading?\u2019 he says in as mild a voice as he can.</p>\n<p>\u2018Yeah! Reading! Look, if you press this it\u2019ll read out the word; and that\u2019ll read out words letter by letter. Oh and this will bring up a picture of the word because I\u2019ve heard that\u2019s a way people learn. It\u2019s not so great on abstract ideas but by the time you get to those you shouldn\u2019t need the pictures.\u2019</p>\n<p>It\u2019s going to teach Matt how to read. The Avengers think Matt can\u2019t read. Any fire in his blood freezes as he tries to figure out how they could have reached this conclusion. What did he do? How did they get this idea?</p>\n<p>What should he\u00a0<em>do?</em></p>\n<p>\u2018So?\u2019 Stark finally asks after having explained every feature that Matt\u2019s never going to be able to use. \u2018What do you think?\u2019</p>\n<p>For a moment Matt considers telling Stark what he actually thinks, that it\u2019s a piece of useless shit that\u2019s aimed at solving the wrong problem. But there\u2019s a note in his cocky voice; a hesitant sound in the way he asks that makes Matt pause. Somehow, he has some kind of power over Stark in his acceptance of this\u2026 this thing.</p>\n<p>And what can he say if he rejects it? It\u2019s not like he can say that yes, he can read so long as the letters are raised, handwritten or braille? Hell\u2019s Kitchen is a small part of New York, it won\u2019t take them long to track down the blind man that matches Daredevil\u2019s description.</p>\n<p>\u2018It\u2019s\u2026 it\u2019s certainly something,\u2019 Matt manages to say. \u2018I\u2019m not sure what to say. I\u2026 I really don\u2019t need it.\u2019 But there\u2019s a waver in his voice, some of the frozen fury and hurt he\u2019s feeling creeping into his voice. It makes him sound like he\u2019s lying.</p>\n<p>\u2018Take it anyway,\u2019 Stark says, putting the briefcase at Matt\u2019s feet as his gauntlets slip onto his hands. \u2018Gift from us all.\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018You all?\u2019 Matt can\u2019t keep the outrage from his voice.</p>\n<p>Stark waves his hands around. \u2018Hey, we\u2019re not judging. You do good work even with your issue, we barely noticed it.\u2019 His face piece slips back onto his face with a hiss. \u2018Good work,\u2019 he repeats, in a robotic voice. Then he\u2019s gone, blaring off into the night sky with a roar of his repulsors.</p>\n<p>Matt does the only logical thing he can think of. He packs the tablet up and runs to the safest place he knows.</p>\n<p>Foggy\u2019s apartment.</p>\n<p>********</p>\n<p>\u2018The Avengers think you\u2019re\u2026 <em>what?</em> <em> \u2019 </em></p>\n<p>Matt continues pacing up and down Foggy\u2019s living room, running his hands through his hair. His suit is all over Foggy\u2019s floor, lying wherever he threw it in his angry attempts to get it off while trying to explain to Foggy that yes he\u2019s uninjured and here for a reason other than help with patching himself up.</p>\n<p>\u2018Illiterate. They think I can\u2019t read, Foggy.\u2019</p>\n<p>Foggy, as the best friend Matt could ever ask for, manages to swallow the laugh that\u2019s in his voice. \u2018You. They think <em>you're</em>\u00a0illiterate. Mr Matt \u2018I read my Criminal Law textbook for fun years after we stopped needing to use it\u2019 Murdock? Mr Matt \u2018I graduated summa cum laude\u2019 Murdock? Mr-\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018Mr Matt \u2018I\u2019m blind and can\u2019t let them know it\u2019 Murdock,\u2019 Matt cuts in and Foggy hisses in realisation.</p>\n<p>\u2018But\u2026 can\u2019t you fake that? With your senses?\u2019</p>\n<p>Matt sighs. \u2018I\u2019m still blind Foggy,\u2019 he says in a defeated tone as he collapses into Foggy\u2019s couch. \u2018I can\u2019t read a screen. I need my hands to read a piece of paper and that\u2019s very obvious. Not many ways I can fake reading something held up to my face.\u2019 He nudges the briefcase. \u2018This is completely useless.\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018Huh,\u2019 Foggy says as he gets up to grab the briefcase and pulls out the tablet. \u2018Oh man this is a <em> StarkLet </em>. Duuude.\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018Aimed at helping me learn to read,\u2019 Matt says bitterly. \u2018Go nuts but it\u2019s basically a one purpose device from what Stark said.\u2019</p>\n<p>Foggy puts the tablet down and moves to sit beside Matt on the rather small couch. \u2018You\u2019re not okay.\u2019</p>\n<p>Matt huffs a laugh. \u2018I\u2019m fine.\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018You\u2019d say that if you were dying. You\u2019ve <em> said that </em>\u00a0while dying.\u2019 Foggy places a gentle hand on Matt\u2019s shoulder. \u2018Excuse me if I don\u2019t believe you.\u2019</p>\n<p>Matt thinks about moving so Foggy\u2019s hand falls off his shoulder but decides against it. It\u2019s kinda comforting where it is. \u2018I am fine.\u2019 He tries to give Foggy a reassuring smile but can feel how brittle it is.</p>\n<p>And Foggy\u2019s always been able to read him. Even when Matt was knee deep in lies to him, Foggy could tell what Matt was thinking. \u2018This is really hurting you,\u2019 he says, cutting straight to the heart of the matter. \u2018Are you going to correct them?\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018I can\u2019t.\u2019 Matt slams his head into the back of the couch. \u2018It\u2019s the perfect cover. They\u2019re looking for a man who can\u2019t read, probably a high school dropout. Someone\u2026 someone too stupid to be able to spell Manhattan. Not a blind lawyer who, as you put it, graduated summa cum laude and reads difficult books for fun. I could tell them to their faces I\u2019m a lawyer and they\u2019d just think I was lying.\u2019 Matt bites his lip and ducks his head so he\u2019s looking away from Foggy. \u2018It\u2019s fine. It\u2019s perfect.\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018But- Matt. Matt. Matt!\u2019 Foggy places a gentle hand on Matt\u2019s chin and turns it so they\u2019re facing another. \u2018But can you live with it?\u2019</p>\n<p>With another brittle smile Matt says, \u2018I\u2019m going to have to, aren\u2019t I?\u2019</p>\n<p>Foggy sighs and pulls Matt into a hug.</p>\n<p>Matt carefully notes how he doesn\u2019t say Matt is wrong.</p>\n<p>********</p>\n<p>It\u2019s nearly too easy for Matt to avoid the Avengers for the next week. Even the sneakiest of them - the Black Widow - makes enough noise for Matt to hear coming and none of them know the Kitchen like he does. None of them know that this church leaves its doors unlocked or that this dumpster is emptied Thursdays and never filled until Wednesday. Matt knows the details of a city he can\u2019t help but hear and disappearing into its shadows is child\u2019s play.</p>\n<p>He does note that Clint is the only Avenger not to stroll Hell\u2019s Kitchen in search of the Devil. Matt\u2019s vaguely\u2026 something about that, even as he ducks out of sight of Iron Man for the third time tonight, hiding near a boiler so if Stark has some kind of heat signature detector or whatever, he won\u2019t see Matt. Man really is stubborn.</p>\n<p>Clint appears on the ninth night, the first one Matt\u2019s not had to play hide and seek with an Avenger since Stark\u2019s gift. He doesn\u2019t chase Matt down to talk or force him into playing hide and seek to avoid meeting him. Instead, he just takes a seat on the edge of a rooftop near abouts the center of Hell\u2019s Kitchen and sits there.</p>\n<p>And sits there. For three hours, not moving once while Matt patrols; even when Matt deliberately takes a path that goes past his rooftop. Clint waves as he passes but doesn\u2019t move.</p>\n<p>Confused and a little bit pleased, Matt eventually makes his way to Clint\u2019s roof. He takes a path that puts him behind Clint, relying on his abilities to help him sneak up on the archer.</p>\n<p>\u2018I might not be able to hear you sometimes,\u2019 Clint says and Matt pauses a step behind him, \u2018but I can see your shadow.\u2019</p>\n<p>Matt laughs and takes a seat beside him. \u2018If I\u2019d snuck up on you, you might have fallen. Only fair to give you some warning.\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018Keep telling yourself that, Devil.\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018I thought I said I\u2019d answer to Mike?\u2019</p>\n<p>Clint shifts in his seat then sighs. \u2018Wasn\u2019t sure I was still welcome to call you that.\u2019 Matt tilts his head questioningly and Clint sighs again. \u2018Heard about what Stark did. And how you\u2019ve been avoiding everyone since.\u2019 Something cold rushes through Matt\u2019s veins, causing him to freeze in place after a massive flinch. \u2018Yeah. Sorry. But it's not hard to figure out you\u2019re ah. Not happy with us.\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018I\u2026 I\u2019m not overly impressed,\u2019 Matt lies, ready to leave.</p>\n<p>\u2018Yeah. Like I said. Not sure if I still have the right to call you Mike.\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018Do what you want,\u2019 Matt says as he gets up, moving across the roof as fast as possible.</p>\n<p>Clint stands too but doesn\u2019t leave the side of the roof. \u2018Don\u2019t be embarrassed. Please. Don\u2019t be embarrassed. I get it.\u2019</p>\n<p>Matt pauses on the other side of the roof. \u2018You get it?\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018I\u2019m a deaf carnie that never managed to attend high school let alone drop out of it. Trust me, I understand.\u2019 He fiddles with something in his hands - a knife by the scent of metal and faded blood. \u2018Tony told us what he\u2019d done after he did it. Nearly punched him when he said he\u2019d come out here to fix you. Like you need fixing.\u2019</p>\n<p>He touches his ear and turns around, so he\u2019s not facing Matt. Which Matt is grateful for as it means he can\u2019t see the look of\u2026 well whatever look is on his face.</p>\n<p>Slowly Matt makes his way back across the roof. He stops at Clint\u2019s side and steels his spine. \u2018You\u2019ve not lost the right to call me Mike,\u2019 he finally says. \u2018Unless\u2026?\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018Yeah, there\u2019s something I\u2019m not saying.\u2019 Clint sighs again. \u2018I\u2019m the one who figured out you might be\u2026 well that words aren\u2019t your thing.\u2019 Matt takes a deep breath at the confession, the bottom of his stomach dropping at the thoughts in his head. Clint doesn\u2019t seem to notice and \u00a0shrugs. \u2018I didn\u2019t realise Tony was going to be such an ass about it. Wouldn\u2019t have said anything if I\u2019d known.\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018Would it have made much difference?\u2019 Matt says in a monotone. \u2018It\u2019s not like they wouldn\u2019t have noticed eventually that I have issues\u2026. I have issues with reading.\u2019 It\u2019s not a lie; it\u2019s not a lie, Matt repeats in his head.</p>\n<p>It feels like a lie.</p>\n<p>\u2018Probably not but let me have my guilt. I kinda deserve it\u2026 Mike.\u2019</p>\n<p>Matt smiles. \u2018Maybe.\u2019 A woman\u2019s scream cuts through the night and Matt cocks his head to track it down. Two blocks away.</p>\n<p>He turns to Clint. \u2018How\u2019s your hand to hand?\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018Decent,\u2019 Clint says, the smirk in his voice giving away that his lie is underestimating his abilities, not exaggerating them. \u2018Why?\u2019</p>\n<p>Matt smirks back at him. \u2018Bit of trouble two blocks away. Wanna help?\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018Lead the way.\u2019</p>\n<p>*********</p>\n<p>Clint\u2019s company almost makes up for the whole, Avengers think I\u2019m illiterate and stupid thing. Almost.</p>\n<p>Okay, maybe only a little. A tiny bit. Silver lining and all that. While sometimes it\u2019s all he can do to find a bright side of things, Matt\u2019s a somewhat optimistic idealist - something he\u2019s well aware of even without people continuously pointing it out to him - and that means he can usually find a bright side. This is no exception, and he\u2019s almost grateful to Clint for making it easier.</p>\n<p>Almost still being the key word.</p>\n<p>But two days after Clint helps him knock out a pair of rapists, Matt overhears something that destroys even the tiniest bit of silver lining to this thing.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s hiding out in the shadows of a fire escape, waiting to see if the police recognise the gangster he caught for them. It\u2019s easier to hear now, from the horses\u2019 mouths so to speak, than to try and con the information out of Brett or read it in a newspaper later. If there\u2019s a new gang in town, Matt wants to know now.</p>\n<p>\u2018Daredevil again?\u2019 One cop asks, her voice unfamiliar. Rookie by the smell of the polish on her badge and gun. There\u2019s a lot of them in Hell\u2019s Kitchen right now. Matt\u2019s heard that\u2019s because the precinct is getting most of New York\u2019s recruits for the next few years, in hopes of replacing those lost in the purges.</p>\n<p>An older man, one often found behind the desk with Brett, sighs. \u2018Looks like,\u2019 every bit of his weariness in his voice. Matt feels vaguely guilty. \u2018Got himself one of the Veles gang by the looks of it; someone Fisk didn\u2019t manage to wipe off the earth.\u2019</p>\n<p>One of the Russians. Matt nods in satisfaction and goes to leave.</p>\n<p>He pauses when he hears one of the other rookies on the scene giggle. \u2018Did you just giggle?\u2019 the female rookie asks, her tone disbelieving.</p>\n<p>\u2018No!\u2019 her fellow rookie declares, outrage in every line of his voice. \u2018Just. Daredevil left a note.\u2019</p>\n<p>Matt frowns, sure he\u2019s done nothing of the sort. The female rookie seems to agree with him. \u2018What the hell do you mean? That\u2019s some useless scribble on a piece of rubbish. Bet you got it from the ground.\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018You gotta know what\u2019s important,\u2019 the older cop agrees and Matt scrambles to remember his name. Johnson, that\u2019s it. Sergeant Johnson. \u2018And I can tell you, that ain\u2019t it.\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018But ain\u2019t you heard, Sarge?\u2019 the male rookie asks. \u2018Daredevil\u2019s a retard. I got a friend who got a friend that works for the Avengers and he said they\u2019re working on teaching him how to read. To <em> read </em>.\u2019</p>\n<p>Female rookie starts laughing even as something heavy and cold settles into Matt\u2019s stomach. \u2018No way,\u2019 she says. \u2018Dude brought down <em> Fisk </em>, no way he can\u2019t read.\u2019 She slaps the other rookie lightly on the shoulder as something catches in Matt\u2019s chest, making breathing impossible. \u2018Just a rumour.\u2019</p>\n<p>The other rookie starts to argue that his information is genuine as Matt gathers himself enough to stumble away. He can\u2019t be here. He doesn\u2019t want to be here. He needs to be somewhere else. He has to go and get his confused thoughts in order.</p>\n<p>Matt focuses on the mantra running through his mind.</p>\n<p>\n<em> Sticks and stones may break my bones but words will never hurt me. Sticks and stones may break my bones but words will never hurt me. Sticks and stones may break my bones but words\u2026 but words\u2026 but words\u2026\u00a0 </em>\n</p>\n<p>Stumbling into his apartment, he can\u2019t stop a stray thought. <em> I think I\u2019d rather the sticks and stones </em>.\u00a0</p>\n<p>********</p>\n<p>It\u2019s only later, when Matt\u2019s thoughts are organised enough to think, that he realises one of the Avengers must have let their ideas on his illiteracy slip to some worker in the tower. And like all rumours, it\u2019s spread like wildfire. There\u2019s a chance it\u2019s only made it to the police so far but Matt\u2019s well aware of the effect of rumour and slander. Lawyers make a living off lawsuits related to them for a <em> reason </em>. Once an idea is out there, there\u2019s no stopping it. You can\u2019t kill an idea after all.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s the perfect cover and Matt can\u2019t figure out why the very thought has his chest feeling tight and his eyes wet. Daredevil is not Matt Murdock, no one thinks Matt Murdock is any less capable now than he was before. And, despite what Foggy might think, Daredevil is just a mask Matt hides behind; a means to an end. What people think of him doesn\u2019t matter because he\u2019s not real. In fact, it\u2019s better for Matt\u2019s cover if they <em> do </em>\u00a0think he\u2019s a complete idiot; a high school dropout barely capable of stringing two words together, who is better at fighting than thinking. No one will look twice at Matt Murdock, Esquire, when trying to find a Daredevil like that.</p>\n<p>Why then does it feel like he\u2019s just faced a thousand opponents and barely gotten away with his life? Why does every cell in his body feel absolutely defeated because of a few simple words?</p>\n<p>\n<em> Words have no power, they\u2019re only words. Words have no power, they\u2019re only words. </em>\n</p>\n<p>Even if Matt wasn\u2019t a lawyer whose entire livelihood is words, he\u2019d know he\u2019s only lying to himself.</p>\n<p>********</p>\n<p>The leak must have come from the Avengers. Therefore, Matt reasons once he\u2019s finished with his damned pity party - that only makes him feel so guilty for letting a few stupid words get to him -, if he avoids the Avengers and stops working with them, there\u2019ll be nothing to leak. They won\u2019t be able to come up with any more ridiculous theories if there\u2019s no evidence to base them on and they\u2019ll stop trying to \u2018help\u2019 him if they stop seeing him.</p>\n<p>Okay, he\u2019ll have to dodge Avenger patrols of Hell\u2019s Kitchen for a while longer but that\u2019s never been a problem.</p>\n<p>Of course, Matt didn\u2019t factor in the Avengers and their secret, collective ability to generate chaos and suffering on a level Matt can barely imagine. Alien invasions; secret Nazi groups and now\u2026</p>\n<p>Well, now it\u2019s still the \u2018secret\u2019 Nazi group but they\u2019re doing something very out of character. Well even more out of character than the human trafficking had been. Matt is hovering on a rooftop, feeling the temperature drop as the sun sets behind him and listening to the scene below him. He\u2019s pretty sure he\u2019s the only person here getting the full story.</p>\n<p>On one side of the street is a group of Hydra grunts, apparently from Midtown by the streets one seems to be referencing, arguing with their leader over his choice to rob a bank for funding instead of continuing to rely on trafficking their would be victims. The fact that they\u2019re holding this argument inside said bank, with their many hostages listening makes Matt sure that they\u2019re not planning on letting anyone out alive so it doesn\u2019t matter what they overhear.</p>\n<p>And on the other side of the street using the building Matt\u2019s on top of as cover and a base of operations, are the Avengers. They\u2019ve managed to convince the very reluctant cops of Hell\u2019s Kitchen that this is an Avenger matter and shooed them back a few buildings - out of range of most guns, if not out of sight. Matt\u2019s pleased with their foresight to protect the already diminished police force but annoyed at the fact they\u2019ve been here ten minutes and have no sign of a plan yet.</p>\n<p>If it wasn\u2019t for the weapons he can occasionally hear clicking or shifting around, Matt would have already gone in.</p>\n<p>\u2018Look, we can get in no problem,\u2019 Steve growls, tapping on a table - probably pointing at something? - \u2018through this window. Or at least, Clint and Nat can.\u2019 <em> Okay, yes pointing at something. Building plans? </em> Matt thinks as he works his way into their briefing room, being quiet as he slips into the back of the room.</p>\n<p>No one\u2019s heartbeat spikes nor does any one of the seven people in the room address him, so Matt\u2019 thinks he\u2019s managed it.</p>\n<p>\u2018But,\u2019 Steve continues, \u2018there\u2019s no way we make it into the lobby undetected.\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018Can we be fast then?\u2019 Thor asks, in a slightly softer version of his usual boom. \u2018Seek and find them before they slaughter our innocents?\u2019</p>\n<p>Steve shakes his head. \u2018Nat might make it but she\u2019s just one person. Even if the rest of us provide a big, flashy distraction outside, we\u2019ve no idea of numbers. I\u2019m not running the risk of them shooting everyone before Nat can subdue them.\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018Can we get numbers?\u2019 Clint growls. \u2018Stark?\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018No cameras and they\u2019re all muddled up with the hostages for heat signals. I can tell you how many people are in that back but not how many are hostages not Hydra.\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018You could ask,\u2019 Matt says mildly and takes pleasure in the way everyone - bar the Black Widow - jumps. \u2018I\u2019ve a bit of information on the Hydra cell in there.\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018Holy shit, how\u2019d you get in here?\u2019 Clint says, moving to Matt\u2019s side. \u2018I thought the whole, stay in the shadow thing was for effect not because you could teleport or something.\u2019</p>\n<p>Matt gives him a disbelieving look, that he must get even through the cowl as he laughs. \u2018I\u2019m very good at being silent,\u2019 Matt eventually says. \u2018Do you want to know what I know or not?\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018Go ahead,\u2019 Steve says but there\u2019s a note in his voice that makes Matt want to raise his shoulders and leave. It\u2019s the same note he\u2019s heard a thousand times before, when the blind kid dared to put his hand up to have an opinion and the teacher had to call on him. It\u2019s that note that seems to say \u2018I\u2019m letting you speak but my expectations are low\u2019. It\u2019s usually followed by a surprised tone, when Matt proves his blindness did nothing to his intelligence. Almost like the two aren\u2019t related.</p>\n<p>Matt hates that he\u2019s hearing it from <em> Captain America </em>\u00a0of all people. \u2018They\u2019re a Midtown cell of Hydra and they\u2019re much smaller than the one you helped me with. Dozen men at most, looking for a quick buck.\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018Hydra is actually robbing a bank?\u2019 Stark says, confusion in his voice.</p>\n<p>\u2018Well, SHIELD\u2019s not exactly paying them a wage now,\u2019 Matt says with a crooked smile. \u2018I\u2019ve heard it\u2019s a bit hard to run your illegal operation when you haven\u2019t got funds coming in.\u2019</p>\n<p>Stark hums in acknowledgement, as does the man by his side - his deep, thundering heartbeat has Matt thinking this is the Hulk\u2019s human form - while Steve and the Black Widow nod in agreement.</p>\n<p>\u2018Where\u2019d you get this information?\u2019 Falcon asks and there\u2019s a note of confusion in his voice. Like Matt should be incapable of collecting information if he can\u2019t read.</p>\n<p>Though maybe Matt\u2019s reading too much into it. \u2018I listen. There\u2019s lots to hear out on the street for a man who keeps his ears open.\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018Ah, that makes a lot of sense,\u2019 Falcon says and Matt resists the urge to bristle.</p>\n<p>\u2018Thanks Daredevil,\u2019 Ste- Captain America says, and yes, there\u2019s that note. It\u2019s a tiny thing, but hearing it feels like a stab to the gut. Maybe two stabs to the gut, Matt\u2019s had one and that wasn\u2019t actually that awful. He lived.</p>\n<p>\u2018I\u2019m going in after the hostages,\u2019 Matt declares. \u2018With or without you-\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018Daredevil-\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018- the people of Hell\u2019s Kitchen are not going to suffer because you can\u2019t keep your wars out of my city.\u2019 He turns to leave but the Black Widow steps in front of him. He cocks his head at her. \u2018Yes?\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018The two of us slip in quietly while they all do their loud and noisy distraction.\u2019 Her voice is soft and sweet but Matt can hear how measured each word is and sense how her body language is as submissive as possible. She\u2019s trying to manipulate him.</p>\n<p>But if it gets those people out of there, away from the Avengers and their stupid ideas and battles\u2026 \u2018I don\u2019t need help,\u2019 he says just as soft, as if he\u2019s trying for bravo and missing.</p>\n<p>\u2018Never said you did. But I can be known to be useful.\u2019</p>\n<p>Matt stands there for a long moment then turns and walks out; his silence the only approval he\u2019s willing to give. The Black Widow appears at his side a moment later, as he climbs onto a neighbouring roof and begins to work his way through the shadows to get across the street. She keeps up with him, nearly silent to his sensitive ears.</p>\n<p>\u2018Not bad,\u2019 he whispers, as they land on the roof of the building beside the bank.</p>\n<p>\u2018Not too bad yourself,\u2019 she says in a voice almost as quiet.</p>\n<p>\u2018What\u2019s our entry point?\u2019 She doesn\u2019t reply, just pointing at the bank. Matt draws together his senses and figures out she\u2019s either pointing at the window just above the dumpster or the one to the left of it, two stories up. \u2018Okay. I\u2019ll follow you.\u2019</p>\n<p>She freezes for barely a second but the panicked flicker of her heart echoes in Matt\u2019s ears. The Black Widow doesn\u2019t trust him to watch her back? Or\u2026 or doesn\u2019t think he\u2019s up to watching her back\u2026 capable of watching her back. \u2018I would have thought you\u2019d prefer to be first in,\u2019 she says, none of her body\u2019s reaction to be found in her voice.</p>\n<p>Matt gives her a charming smile, even though all he wants to do is scream at her. \u2018I\u2019m willing to admit that of the two of us, you\u2019re probably the better fighter.\u2019 From what he\u2019s heard and sensed, it\u2019s not a lie.</p>\n<p>She nods anyway, accepting his words or at least deciding not to argue with them. Again, she hardly makes a sound as she jumps onto the fire escape of the bank\u2019s building, then carefully works her way along the window sill of the floor above the window she may have indicated. Right, it was the second option then. Matt\u2019s a step behind her, listening as she picks the lock of the window and slips into the building. It takes Matt a little bit of work - she made walking along the side of the building seem easy, but he\u2019s right behind her.</p>\n<p>Neither of them comment, but Widow gives him a sharp nod as he slips in through the window. Having not had a chance to feel the building plans - and Matt\u2019s half sure they wouldn\u2019t have been readable to him anyway \u00a0- Matt follows her lead as they advance through the building. They\u2019re silent as they move, but there\u2019s little need to be; Matt can hear that everyone in the building is gathered in the lobby and these offices are all empty.</p>\n<p>Finally they reach the stairs to descend to the lobby. But Widow pauses at the top.</p>\n<p>\u2018What?\u2019 Matt hisses.</p>\n<p>\u2018I\u2019ll go down first. Wait here.\u2019 Before Matt can protest, she\u2019s down the stairs and slinking into the back of the cashiers area, taking out the man pacing there before he even manages a breath.</p>\n<p>Matt waits thirty seconds, just long enough so that she\u2019s out of sight, before following. He immediately tries to sense out the light switch, aware he\u2019s about to screw Widow over but well\u2026 if she\u2019d not run off alone, he would have told her his plan. Lights out is his biggest advantage; she\u2019ll have to cope. It\u2019s his damned city after all.</p>\n<p>Outside, Stark begins to scream obscenities at Hydra via a loudhailer of some sort and Matt has to smile as it causes a steady flow of gun wielding men moving towards the front of the building. He can hear Steve\u2019s voice joining in, sans loudhailer but somehow louder, and Matt\u2019s vaguely impressed when Steve begins to outswear Stark. So Steve\u2019s identity as a soldier was stronger than whatever part of him that caused the whole \u2018pure, idealistic icon of America\u2019 he\u2019d been in Matt\u2019s textbooks. Good to know.</p>\n<p>Finally Matt detects a box on the wall, about the level of a light switch. Grinning at the fact he doesn\u2019t have to try and knock out the dozen lights he can hear buzzing by hand, he hits the closer button.</p>\n<p>And nearly drops to his knees at the alarm siren that rings out. A long moment passes before Matt can gather himself to focus past the noise - something he realises is high pitched and probably beyond regular human hearing - and push the button again, cutting it off. Growling at his mistake and ignoring the slight ringing and pain in his ears, Matt presses the other button. Finally, he gets a reaction from everyone else in the room as they cry out in fear.</p>\n<p>The lights must be out. Good.</p>\n<p>Angry at himself and Widow for putting him in this position, Matt throws himself at the nearest man, the smell of gunpowder and metal giving away the gun in his hands. He\u2019s stumbling around in the darkness, so it\u2019s more than easy enough to subdue him; knocking him out with his own gun.</p>\n<p>In fact, all the Hydra men are stumbling around, causing chaos in the darkness and Matt can smell and feel the outside air as a few quick thinking hostages take advantage of the situation to stumble into the street outside. He listens and smiles when he hears Clint herding them to safety. One of the Hydra grunts must notice the fleeing hostages because he starts to make his way towards the door.</p>\n<p>Matt\u2019s on him in an instant, blocking his path and knocking him to the ground. His eyes must be beginning to adjust because he manages to land a hit to Matt\u2019s stomach. But then again, it might have just been a lucky punch, as his next attack is a tackle in the wrong direction that ends up being more of a belly flop at thin air. Matt has no trouble knocking him out after that; a well trained attack guided by his senses.</p>\n<p>The Black Widow also seems to have adjusted to the darkness well, if the ever growing number of men groaning on the ground is anything to judge by. But Matt can hear how she\u2019s breathing, and the way she\u2019s gritting her teeth. She\u2019s <em> mad </em>\u00a0and Matt\u2026</p>\n<p>Well he\u2019d be more sympathetic if she hadn\u2019t left him behind. But this is something to deal with later. Right now there\u2019s still a few Hydra men to deal with.</p>\n<p>********</p>\n<p>Sadly for Matt, later always comes. This time in the form of the post mission debrief that Steve all but drags Matt to, citing his lack of attendance last time.</p>\n<p>\u2018I don\u2019t do debriefs,\u2019 Matt growls as he walks into the room they\u2019re still using as headquarters, followed by the politely insistent Steve. There\u2019s a thumping feeling in his head and he\u2019s sure his hearing isn\u2019t as keen as usual - and maybe ringing slightly. He really just wants to get out of here right now. \u2018There\u2019s no need for me to be here.\u2019</p>\n<p>Steve sounds like he\u2019s swallowing a smile. \u2018You don\u2019t do debriefs because you work alone and you only got out of the one last time you helped us because you took off on us.\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018For good reason,\u2019 Matt grumbles, quickly noting who else is in the room. It seems like they\u2019re the last to arrive because Stark and the Hulk\u2019s human form - whose name begins with a \u2018B\u2019 or \u2018V\u2019 maybe? - are sitting on one side of a table, Falcon and the Black Widow at the other. Clint is perched on top of the table, beside the Black Widow while Thor seems to have claimed the side furthest from the door as his own. There\u2019s two seats left on the free side of the table, clearly an invitation for Matt.</p>\n<p>But Matt\u2019s not going to take it. Sitting at the table would be a clear sign he considers himself a part of their team, when he really really doesn\u2019t. And there\u2019s nothing on this Earth right now would make him want to be a part of it. \u00a0So he slips past the table and stands by the open window, fairly sure he\u2019s in the sight line of everyone but Stark and Hulk, folding his arms over his chest and trying to give off the best impression of \u2018reluctantly there\u2019 he can manage.</p>\n<p>\u2018Oh hey, you did get Hornhead here,\u2019 Stark says, twisting in his chair. \u2018And you\u2019re not going to sit, I didn\u2019t know we didn\u2019t have to sit. Is sitting optional? Because I can tot-\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018Tony,\u2019 Steve says with a sigh. \u2018Daredevil, there is a chair there-?\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018No,\u2019 Matt says simply and refuses to say more, leading to a long and very awkward silence.</p>\n<p>Finally Steve gets the hint. \u2018Okay. Right.\u2019 He starts the debriefing, getting everyone to talk out what happened; where they went wrong that can be worked on; and where they did well, starting with those who had stayed outside the bank. Matt tunes out, aware Steve\u2019s probably delaying his part of the debrief to try and keep him here for the whole thing.</p>\n<p>\u2018Nat your turn. Inside the bank, any issues?\u2019 Matt\u2019s attention snaps back to the table when Steve turns to the Black Widow.</p>\n<p>She sighs. \u2018Nothing that can be improved as of now.\u2019</p>\n<p>Matt frowns. \u2018What do you mean by that?\u2019</p>\n<p>Every head in the room turns to look at him as she steadies her spine. \u2018I checked the switchboard you touched. It was clearly labelled, you should have had no problems activating the alarm instead of turning the lights off.\u2019 Her heart is a touch faster than usual, something Matt\u2019s sure means she\u2019s furious and her tone has a mild note of confusion. \u2018You created chaos that complicated our mission because you refuse to improve yourself.\u2019</p>\n<p><em> What? </em>\u00a0Matt thinks before registering what she said about the labels. If she thinks he was going for the alarm and missed\u2026 Oh. This is about the reading thing. \u2018I don\u2019t need improving,\u2019 he snarls, ready to offer a passionate defence. They might have the wrong idea but that\u2019s no excuse.</p>\n<p>\u2018You turned the lights off and made everyone\u2019s job a thousand times harder because you couldn\u2019t read the label?\u2019 Falcon asks and something in Matt drops at the tone he\u2019s using. \u2018Man\u2026 I mean, I get being fine as you are, that\u2019s cool but sometimes you gotta take one for the team. And dude, we can help.\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018I have helped!\u2019 an outraged Stark says. \u2018Have you not been using the Starklet I gave you? You should be a thousand times better now than you were.\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018Hey, not everyone learns at the same pace,\u2019 Clint snaps. \u2018Or needs to learn at all-\u2019</p>\n<p>Matt stands there frozen, as the conversation descends into bickering over how fast a person can learn to read (fast, so long as they\u2019re willing to work at it seems to be the consensus) and if they should be forced to do it at all (yes as the consensus, but Clint and the Hulk are the only ones really arguing that maybe forcing is an awful idea, though Thor is saying nothing at all). They\u2019re all a moment away from shouting at another and no one is even talking to\u00a0<em> him. </em>It\u2019s like he\u2019s invisible.</p>\n<p>Like his opinion doesn\u2019t matter.</p>\n<p>Steve puts his fingers in his mouth and whistles, a piercing noise that shuts everyone up and has Matt\u2019s hands flinching towards his ears. \u2018That\u2019s enough!\u2019 The room falls silent at the whistle and Matt can hear everyone shifting in their seats. Feeling guilty maybe? He hopes they are at least. \u2018Daredevil? Steve says, turning to him. \u2018You okay?\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018I\u2019m fine,\u2019 Matt says in a deadpan voice. \u2018Are we going to debrief or just argue my personal life?\u2019</p>\n<p>Stark sighs. \u2018You wanna be a hero, you don\u2019t get to have a personal life.\u2019 He sounds weary and defeated but Matt has to bite his tongue to stop himself screaming at him. \u2018Not for things that affect others. Not for things you can <em> fix. </em>\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018Good thing I work alone and don\u2019t need fixing.\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018Why are you so hesitant?\u2019 Falcon asks as he stands. \u2018I get that it\u2019s scary and new, but reading, reading is awesome. You\u2019ll open so many doors for yourself, be something better.\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018And you won\u2019t cause chaos for your teammates by hitting the wrong switch,\u2019 the Black Widow adds dryly, but Matt can still detect a hint of anger in her voice.</p>\n<p>Matt stops leaning against the wall and takes a slight step right, placing himself directly in front of the window. \u2018I don\u2019t need to be fixed,\u2019 he repeats, to a general sigh from the room. Biting his lips, he faces the Black Widow. \u2018And for the record? I hit the switch I was aiming for.\u2019 Tension seeps into the room as everyone either sits up or stands. \u2018If you hadn\u2019t left me behind, you would have known what I was planning.\u2019</p>\n<p>And with that, before anyone can move, Matt turns and throws himself out the window, already reaching out to grab the fire escape under it. It wrenches at his shoulder, but he gets a grip on its railing. From there, he\u2019s able to drop down onto the stairwell below it and in a few seconds, he\u2019s on the ground in the alleyway and running.</p>\n<p>The Avengers will probably take to the roofs to track him down. That\u2019s fine, Matt doesn\u2019t need to use them tonight. He knows the route to where he\u2019s going by heart for any level of the city he chooses to use.</p>\n<p>It is, after all, the safest place he knows. You should always know your way to where your home is.</p>\n<p>********</p>\n<p>Foggy doesn\u2019t even let Matt get past two knocks on his window before he\u2019s opening it and trying to help Matt through. Of course, since Matt\u2019s not injured (okay, maybe his ears are a little sensitive from the alarm earlier but he\u2019s been pushing past the pain for ages now so it doesn\u2019t count), Foggy ends up being more of a hinderance than a help. They end up in a tangle of limbs on Foggy\u2019s floor but hey, Matt\u2019s through the window and inside so he\u2019ll give Foggy the victory he\u2019ll probably want here.</p>\n<p>\u2018Oh man oops,\u2019 Foggy says as Matt untangles himself from his friend and helps him up. \u2018I thought I was helping.\u2019</p>\n<p>Matt gives him a mild smile. \u2018You were.\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018Uh huh. You do realise that now I know your secret, you\u2019re a shit liar?\u2019 Matt can\u2019t help the flinch at the sting but just gives a small nod. \u2018Okay. You hurt?\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018I\u2019m fine.\u2019</p>\n<p>Foggy sighs and buries his face in a hand. \u2018You\u2019ve said that so much, it no longer has meaning. Are you bleeding?\u2019</p>\n<p>Matt considers. He can smell the faint scent of copper but it\u2019s probably from the men he beat up. \u2018No?\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018Right. Take that mask off and I\u2019ll get us beer to cel - HOLY SHIT! You said you weren\u2019t bleeding!\u2019</p>\n<p>Pausing halfway through taking his mask off, Matt cocks his head. \u2018I\u2019m not?\u2019</p>\n<p>Before he can protest further, Foggy\u2019s hands are on his, wiping the trail of blood from the side of Matt\u2019s face. A second later and Matt can feel the heat of the flashlight in his hands as he shines it into Matt\u2019s ear. \u2018No blood in your ears. Ah, that\u2019s good right?\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018Probably?\u2019 Matt shakes his head a bit but Foggy doesn\u2019t let go.</p>\n<p>\u2018Right. Um, any pain or headache or anything? That could be important?\u2019</p>\n<p>With a smile, Matt gently moves Foggy\u2019s hands off his head. \u2018I got a sudden alarm siren in my ears for a moment but other than that I\u2019m-\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018-fine,\u2019 Foggy interrupts with a sigh. \u2018You know what? That word is banned. No more \u2018fine\u2019 in my apartment. Yours too. Can\u2019t happen, no more. You\u2019re not allowed to say it.\u2019 He stops and seems to consider for a moment. \u2018Unless you mean fine like, <em> F.I.N.E. </em>\u2019</p>\n<p>Matt blinks. \u2018I can hear the difference in those \u2018fine\u2019s but I\u2019m not sure what you mean by it.\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018F.I.N.E. Fucked up. Insecure. Neurotic. Emotional. You\u2019re F.I.N.E.\u2019 Foggy leads Matt to the couch; a familiar motion from their early days of living together in the second year of law school. \u2018That\u2019s how I\u2019m going to take it every time you use that word from now on buddy. So you have a choice. Either accept the new definition-\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018Or stop using the word,\u2019 Matt says with a soft smile. \u2018You drive a hard bargain counselor.\u2019</p>\n<p>They\u2019re sitting close enough on the couch that Matt can feel Foggy\u2019s shrug as well as hear it. \u2018I do try my friend. So,\u2019 he says after a moment of silence, \u2018if you\u2019re not hurt, why are you here?\u2019</p>\n<p>The memory of what the Avengers said, complete with the icy fury burning in his veins, springs to Matt\u2019s mind. But here, safe by Foggy\u2019s side in an apartment that smells and feels like home, there\u2019s a dimness to the memories. Like he\u2019s feeling them through a pane of glass instead of in real time. And Matt has an awareness that while sharing his experience might add even more panes of glass to his emotional windows (okay, his metaphors might need some work), it\u2019ll add a burden to Foggy. He\u2019ll get mad; he\u2019ll get upset. He\u2019ll want to comfort Matt and as nice as that sounds\u2026</p>\n<p>Matt\u2019s not to ask Foggy to feel anything negative just for a few moments of comfort.</p>\n<p>\u2018Maybe I just want to spend time with my best friend?\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018At two in the morning?\u2019 Right, Foggy\u2019s always been able to see through Matt\u2019s bullshit.</p>\n<p>Matt shrugs. \u2018Thought it was earlier. I lost track of time. Not like I wear a watch as Daredevil.\u2019</p>\n<p>But Foggy\u2019s no idiot. \u2018And you said you can hear every television, radio and clock in Hell\u2019s Kitchen. No way you don\u2019t know the time every minute that you\u2019re out there.\u2019 He fumbles down the side of the couch with his right hand, the one furthest from Matt, and pulls out a remote. Before Matt can comment, he\u2019s turning his crappy, second hand T.V. on.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s on a news station, though Matt doesn\u2019t recognise the woman speaking and thus can\u2019t identify which one. <em>'</em> <em> Coming up next, more breaking news on the Avenger\u2019s dramatic showdown with Hydra at a bank in Hell\u2019s Kitchen; including rumors that our local vigilante was seen at the scene. Is he working with the Avengers? Is this a sign that they approve of the Devil of Hell\u2019s Kitchen\u2019s actions? Do they think vigilantism is a viable solution to our crime problem? More on these questions, when we return.\u2019\u00a0 </em>Foggy flicks the T.V. off again and turns slightly, so he\u2019s facing Matt.</p>\n<p>\u2018So this has nothing to do with the fact you may or may not have fought aside the Avengers, people so moronic they both think you can\u2019t read and seem to think that matters?\u2019</p>\n<p>Somehow, Foggy always cuts to the heart of an issue. It\u2019s part of what makes him such a great lawyer - and what had caused their fight to be as huge as it was. He doesn\u2019t allow for loopholes or lies disguised as truths. He just says it like it is, like he sees it, and it\u2019s up to you to refute him. If you can.</p>\n<p>Matt rarely can, when he\u2019s like this. \u2018I may have fought alongside an Avenger tonight.\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018And?\u2019 Foggy prompts, when Matt says nothing else.</p>\n<p>With a turn of his head, so Foggy can\u2019t see his face, Matt admits, \u2018And they may have been ah, upset, when I seemingly mixed up the labels on a switch in the bank and hit the lights instead of the alarm.\u2019</p>\n<p>The only reason Matt knows Foggy is blinking in confusion is because he can hear his eyelashes fluttering. Okay, and because he knows his friend, although facial expressions aren\u2019t usually something he bothers to imagine. Matt processes other people\u2019s emotions in voices and heartbeats, not faces.</p>\n<p>\u2018But why would you want the ala- ohhh.\u2019</p>\n<p>So it\u2019s dawned on him too. \u2018Yeah. They couldn\u2019t imagine a reason someone would want to hit the lights so they\u2026 they jumped to a conclusion.\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018And insulted you, I\u2019m sure.\u2019 Foggy\u2019s tone is as emotionless as his lawyer training can make it but Matt can read his anger in the way his heart is pounding and the stiffness of his body. He\u2019s <em> pissed </em>. \u2018What did they say?\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018No-\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018Matt.\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018No Foggy. I don\u2019t need you to know, or to say anything. It\u2019s f- okay. It\u2019s okay,\u2019 Matt lies.</p>\n<p>But Foggy\u2019s only ever bought one of Matt\u2019s lies - a big series of lies, but a single lie really - and that is because he never could have imagined it. He sees through this as well as he does everything else Matt\u2019s ever lied about. \u2018No it\u2019s not.\u2019 Matt looks away, a wordless admission Foggy is right. \u2018You can\u2019t keep this up. Something is going to give.\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018I know.\u2019</p>\n<p>Foggy continues as if Matt didn\u2019t speak. \u2018And I\u2019m worried\u2026 Matt, promise me you won\u2019t let their stupidness get you killed. Please don\u2019t let them kill you. Leave them alone if you have to, stop the team ups, but don\u2019t let them kill you.\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018I won\u2019t,\u2019 Matt says and is glad Foggy can\u2019t hear the way his heart flutters at the half lie.</p>\n<p>But from the way Foggy sighs, Matt thinks his friend caught the lie anyway.</p>\n<p>*********</p>\n<p>It\u2019s not just the Avengers who are out in full force the next few nights, as Matt spends half his nights beating various men and women to unconsciousness before they can kill themselves. Hydra is just ridiculous sometimes. But at least they\u2019re not looking for him, unlike the Avengers who seem determined to talk.</p>\n<p>Matt\u2019s not willing to talk. It\u2019s not like they\u2019re listening anyway.</p>\n<p>Of course, to his displeasure, the Hydra assholes he\u2019s beating on seem equally as reluctant to talk. Considering Matt\u2019s absolutely sure he chased the last of the Hydra cell in Hell\u2019s Kitchen out of town, he spends most of the time beating them trying to get some form of information out of them.</p>\n<p>Tonight this woman is so far as tight lipped as her counterparts and Matt\u2019s continuing to beat her, regardless of the grating feeling in his soul every time a punch lands. He\u2019s being ridiculous and vaguely sexist, she has information and this is the means to get it out of her.</p>\n<p>Finally she tries to go for her tooth and Matt lands a carefully aimed punch to the jaw that breaks it, stopping her moving it. Brutal, but effective as a means of keeping her alive. Course it\u2019s going to make getting to talk impossible but at least she\u2019s alive.</p>\n<p>Slowly Matt moves the now whimpering woman into the street, positioning her under a streetlight as he hears sirens in the background. They\u2019re getting louder, and they should pass by here in a minute. If they\u2019re any sort of cop they\u2019ll stop for the injured woman and figure out she\u2019s Hydra fast.</p>\n<p>Matt searchers through her pockets, looking for the little pin they all seem to carry. Just having it pinned to her shirt should be enough to get her handcuffed to a hospital bed and put on suicide watch. She\u2019ll not escape her punishm-</p>\n<p>He pauses as he feels a slip of paper, folded in her pocket. Printer paper, by the smell of it, not high grade but not scrap either. It\u2019s a familiar scent to Matt, after all his years working in various office like situations. He unfolds it gently and hears her outraged and slightly terrified whimper as he does.</p>\n<p>Perfect. \u2018Thank you for the information,\u2019 he says with a bright smirk and races for the rooftops as the police cruiser turns the corner. They stop a moment later with a squealequel of brakes and are out of the car in nearly the same moment, guns drawn and pointed where Matt had been.</p>\n<p>But he\u2019s already gone, a shadow on the rooftops, out of their sightline even if they\u2019re still in his earshot. He listens until they realise the woman is Hydra and organise transport to the nearest hospital before slipping further away. He needs somewhere a touch more private to examine what he\u2019s found.</p>\n<p>Once he\u2019s on a deserted roof, alone but for a couple of rats and a sleeping cat, he carefully pulls off his gloves and takes out the piece of paper. He runs his fingers over it, not surprised to realise that whatever is on it is printed. If he focuses he can\u2026 nope. There\u2019s nothing to feel, the ink from the printer has left no indents or raised ink or anything he can sense. He knows there\u2019s something on the paper; the smell of the ink and the slight greasy feel of the paper under his fingers is enough to tell him that. But there\u2019s no way for him to tell what\u2019s on it without asking for help.</p>\n<p>Matt grits his teeth at the thought of having to ask for help.</p>\n<p>His fingers brush the bottom half of the page and he pauses at the indents he feels there. Quickly Matt finds the beginning of the indents, not surprised to realise it\u2019s a handwritten address, probably responsible for the bulk of ink he can smell. Focusing, he feels out the address.</p>\n<p>30th and 12th. Outside Hell\u2019s Kitchen but only just.</p>\n<p>Normally the \u2018only just\u2019 would be enough for Matt to decide to pass it on, to leave a note or the paper itself for the police or Avengers so that others can take this fight. He wants to help people, but he\u2019s aware of his limits. ...Okay, somewhat aware of his limits. If he tries to protect everyone, to defend the whole of New York, he\u2019s going to burn himself out and get himself killed. When he started this, he chose to defend his city, his people and for the most part he\u2019s stuck to that. They\u2019re the ones who needed it most after all, the people left behind by people like the Avengers who don\u2019t care about the little guys.</p>\n<p>But it\u2019s only a few streets over. Barely out of his range. He can check it out, see what it is and return to get Foggy to help figure out this piece of paper. More information is good and it\u2019s not like he\u2019s going to engage. Just look.</p>\n<p>Well listen. But what could go wrong?</p>\n<p>********</p>\n<p>The address is not an abandoned warehouse, as Matt\u2019s come to expect from these fractured and scrambling Hydra cells. No, this time it\u2019s some kind of office building that\u2019s close to the water but not right on it and a few stories high but only a few. It\u2019s almost ordinary, the sort of thing you\u2019d expect of a mid-sized company that\u2019s too big to be at risk of failing but too small to be noticed easily. Completely unremarkable in every way. A good disguise, if Matt\u2019s honest, for a secret Nazi-death cult.</p>\n<p>He perches on the roof of the building next to it and focuses his attention on the building, pushing all his senses towards it. Voices are coming from the third floor, some sort of meeting. Matt can pick out the voices of at most a dozen people, a couple of whom have drowned themselves in so much perfume he can taste it through the open window. They seem to be discussing - no negotiating, that\u2019s a raised voice - some kind of consolidation de-</p>\n<p>A consolidation deal. Matt\u2019s breathing picks up as a man calls for silence in the room, getting it instantly. These are leaders of various Hydra cells in the city and if they consolidate into a single Hydra\u2026</p>\n<p>Well, it\u2019s bad news for Hell\u2019s Kitchen. And New York.</p>\n<p>Matt\u2019s jumping across to the Hydra building\u2019s roof even before he\u2019s quite processed what\u2019s happening. They\u2019re a floor below him now but Matt didn\u2019t hear any movement beyond those moving around in the meeting room. But if these are a bunch of Hydra leaders they\u2019re all going to have bodyguards or something similar around. This has all the trappings of a bad situation to walk into alone.</p>\n<p>So he should walk away. Get help. Be reasonable about this. It\u2019s what Foggy would want him to do, it\u2019s the smart thing to do.</p>\n<p>On the other hand\u2026 if he\u2019s fast, if he only takes out that room full of people and calls the cops the moment they\u2019re all down\u2026 He might be able to use the police to create an ambush for any guards that are there; keep them stuck in the building with their bosses and at his mercy. It\u2019s risky but it\u2019ll make sure that these monsters end up behind bars tonight without any chance for escape.</p>\n<p>Matt nods to himself. It\u2019s a good plan. A solid plan. He can make it work.</p>\n<p>He can.</p>\n<p>********</p>\n<p>He can\u2019t.</p>\n<p>Matt gets to the third floor with minimal problems (two broken jaws and minor scratch on Matt counts as minimal problems, right?) and hovers outside the door to the meeting room for a long moment. Focusing, he\u2019s sure there\u2019s eight people in the room, two women and six men. He can\u2019t be sure if their backs are to this door so his first step is going to be to take out the buzzing light he can hear.</p>\n<p>He can do this.</p>\n<p>Bursting through the doorway, Matt throws his stick with the uncanny precision that Stick relentlessly drilled into him. He\u2019s surrounded by cries of shock as the lights go out with a smash and for a moment Matt has to smile at how well his plan is going.</p>\n<p>The smile slides off his face a second later as it begins to dawn on him how badly he\u2019s miscalculated here. In an almost coordinated movement every person in the room is on their feet and stumbling towards Matt; their progress only hampered by the presence of the table in the centre of the room. But three of them are already on top of it and Matt has to dodge out of the way of their jumping tackles. They take out three of their own people but everyone is on their feet a moment later, managing to trap Matt in the centre of a circle.</p>\n<p>It should be chaos, body parts everywhere with Matt at its heart and exploiting them falling all over one another. But every person in this room is well trained, and Matt\u2019s barely managing to dodge the attacks he\u2019s facing. There\u2019s no space for him to attack, no time for him to think, and he\u2019s sure he\u2019s only avoided any fatal hits because of his abilities. A split second warning of an attack is still a warning and Matt knows how to exploit that at least. He takes advantage of one woman\u2019s bloody punch - is it his blood he tastes or hers? - \u00a0to dodge towards the wall, eager to have a side of him not facing an enemy.</p>\n<p>Two men are down, felled by attacks from their own men which shows at least some weakness in their training, and one of the women has stepped away. Matt can hear her requesting backup from a nearby Hydra cell - hers probably - and for a second he recognises the steady, calm drawl of the voice on the other side of the call, even with its note of panic. But then someone gets a punch through his defences and Matt can\u2019t help the cry he makes, forgetting all about the voice as his breath leaves his body. He can hear the man laugh and uses that to direct his punch into the man\u2019s jaw.</p>\n<p>The man goes down but Matt\u2019s still facing five people, plus what sounds like another half dozen thundering up the stairs. Their footsteps pound together in Matt\u2019s head as he resists the temptation to clutch at his ribs. He ducks under one punch, the thump of it hitting the wall behind him ringing in his ears. Drops of his blood drip down his cheeks and coat his tongue. Matt\u2019s not sure if that\u2019s from his split lip or somewhere else. It might not even be his blood.</p>\n<p>How long has he been fighting? He lands a solid kick to one of the women\u2019s ribs and feels them break; the crunching noise doing nothing to distract him from the feel of bones giving when they should not. Has it been hours? The second woman punches him on the cheek, the scent of her nail polish almost as awful as the pain of his skin splitting under the force of the punch. How many enemies does Matt have left? Five? Eleven? None?</p>\n<p>He falls to his knees to avoid a punch - kick? - aimed at his head. Every limb is heavy, begging him to keep falling and rest on the floor. He\u2019s a Murdock though. Murdocks always get up. So he locks his knees and moves out of the way of a kick. Grabbing the man\u2019s knee gives him the leverage he needs to rise to his feet, with the added advantage of making the man scream in pain; a sound that rings through the room with an unfading echo.</p>\n<p>Echoes and echoes, showing Matt he\u2019s got a lot of work to do. He can do it. He can do it.</p>\n<p>He has to do it. He\u2019s dead if he doesn\u2019t.</p>\n<p>Dodge, punch. Punch, dodge. Punch\u2026 no that\u2019s more of a flail, though a flail directed at a nose that cracks under his hand, causing a flash of heat in his knuckles that Matt pushes aside as much as he can. Sloppy. Sloppy. Sloppy.</p>\n<p>How many left?</p>\n<p>He can taste the air outside, New York\u2019s finest smog and polluted river water sitting on his tongue. The window is open, he knows this. Why is he focusing on it-</p>\n<p>The distinctive \u2018twang\u2019 of a bow.</p>\n<p>Matt gives into his weakness and falls. Blood falls with him, from the shoulder of the man whose hand was an inch from his throat. It coats the floor and clouds Matt\u2019s senses as a second twang breaks the night air.</p>\n<p>A roar outside as Stark\u2019s loud <em> too loud </em>\u00a0repulsors sound by the window. A roar inside as Captain America - Steve - charges into the room, perfume and blood by his side and fighting far better than Matt ever could.</p>\n<p>And through the chorus of pained cries and creaking, snapping bones, a calm, soft voice to go with the firm, steady hands at his throat. Only the familiar voice stops him lashing out at the hands as their owner checks his pulse. Matt groans to let him - Falcon, has to be Falcon, scent of oil and metal - know he\u2019s still alive. And awake.</p>\n<p>\u2018Holy shit, how are you still awake?\u2019 Falcon says, and Matt realises there\u2019s been words flowing around him since the Avengers arrived.</p>\n<p>\u2018I\u2019m a Murdock,\u2019 Matt tries to say but it gets caught somewhere between his brain and his lips, coming out a groan instead. Still, Murdocks don\u2019t stay down and the groans and cracks of the fighting are dying down. Matt has to get up, be on his feet when they win.</p>\n<p>Be on his feet when he loses.</p>\n<p>He pushes up to his hands and knees, mourning the loss of the hardwood floor. So much softer than he remembered hardwood being, smooth and cold against his skin. A force on his back tries to push him down but lightly, barely touching his aching back. Matt can ignore it and the throbbing in his gut, to fall back onto his heels.</p>\n<p>\u2018Holy fuck, you\u2019re a stubborn son of a bitch,\u2019 Steve says in a Brooklyn drawl, so much stronger than usual, that\u2019s coloured with concern and admiration. \u2018Sam, Nat, help him.\u2019</p>\n<p>The hand on his back is moved to rest under his arm and Matt puts grateful weight into it so he can rise, moving his own hand to rest on Falcon\u2019s shoulder. Another hand, this one softer with the hint of nail polish and blood, is placed under his other arm. The Black Widow.</p>\n<p>Together, they haul him to his feet. Fiery pain races through him, released in a groan that echoes in his ear and his head and his chest. Legs wobble under the pressure of standing, the pain of standing and every bone aches.</p>\n<p>Blood drips down his nose, falling to the floor with a relentless drip. He\u2019s sure it\u2019s his this time.</p>\n<p>\u2018Home,\u2019 he grunts and something warm ruses through the few bits of him that don\u2019t ache when it comes out a word.</p>\n<p>\u2018Dude, you need a doctor.\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018No.\u2019 Matt tries to push away from the strong, steady arms that want to drag him to a doctor. The grip they have on him tightens and he barely swallows his panicked whine. \u2018No,\u2019 he whispers, and it is as panicked a noise as his whine would have been.</p>\n<p>\u2018Okay. Okay,\u2019 Falcon says and he starts to move forward. On Matt\u2019s other side, the Black Widow follows suit and he tries to match their sure steps with sure steps of his own. His traitorous legs manage only wobbling steps but maybe that\u2019ll do. Maybe? \u2018No doctors. Can Bruce look you over at the Tower?\u2019</p>\n<p>Scrambled thoughts manage to piece together the man with the deep thundering heartbeat and barely remembered flashes of green grass. The Hulk. \u2018Okay,\u2019 Matt manages. \u2018Mask\u2026 mask stays on.\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018Promise,\u2019 Falcon says and the relief steals the last of Matt\u2019s fighting power.</p>\n<p>He loses the battle to stay conscious.</p>\n<p>********</p>\n<p>Awareness brings with it pain and a part of Matt shies away, desperate to return to the peace and comfort of the darkness. But he\u2019s never been one to run from pain - more one to run to pain if you ask Foggy - so he gathers his shaky thoughts and claws through the darkness.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s lying on a soft surface, in an unfamiliar room. Hasn\u2019t he been here before? Only the overwhelming scent of disinfectant and echoing glass makes him sure he\u2019s not back on Claire\u2019s sofa.</p>\n<p>But it\u2019s not a hospital either; it\u2019s lacking\u2026 lacking the cries of the injured and the scent of the dead.</p>\n<p>Groaning, he takes inventory of his body, while reaching his hands up to check\u2026 yes, he still has his mask on. There\u2019s a stabbing pain in his side and another in his head. Okay two stabbing pains, he finds as he tries to move. That can be dealt with. He can hear the groan and creak of old ships in his ribs but only one or two are grinding. He\u2019s had worse. There\u2019s no grinding anywhere else that\u2019s moved. Silver lining.</p>\n<p>All in all, Matt\u2019s been closer to death than this.</p>\n<p>He takes a deep breath and expands his focus. Room is empty but there\u2019s a deep heartbeat just outside, there\u2019s a taste of copper coming from the bin in the corner meaning his wounds were treated here, and he\u2019s certain he\u2019s never going to get the scent of disinfectant out of his nose. This must either be a regularly used first-aid room or the world\u2019s most sanitised lab. Matt\u2019s been in dirtier hospitals.</p>\n<p>With no reason to continue lying around, he tries to rise. Lifting his head and shoulders causes something sharp and painful to race through him and for a moment the stale room vanishes and he is on Claire\u2019s soft couch, her gentle hands trying to keep him still. It fades, leaving only the memory of that pain to compare to this; similar but somehow worse without the comfort of Claire\u2019s now familiar presence.</p>\n<p>A light swish is the only sound the door makes as the man with the deep heartbeat makes his way into the room, talking to someone who is not there, \u2018...amount of blood he lost, no way he\u2019s cons- oh.\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018I did say, Dr Banner,\u2019 a British man says, the speakers distorting his voice and adding a slight crackle to it. \u2018Mr Daredevil is conscious and attempting to leave his bed.\u2019</p>\n<p>Matt ignores both voices until Banner reaches his side, placing both hands on his shoulders and trying to gently push him down. Matt groans at the flash of pain that rips through his chest and Banner\u2019s hands are gone. Good. He continues trying to sit up and hears Banner\u2019s sigh.</p>\n<p>\u2018Steve wasn\u2019t wrong, you really are stubborn.\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018I try,\u2019 Matt grits out.</p>\n<p>\u2018You lost a lot of blood, have at least two broken ribs and probably a concussion though I\u2019d need to take your mask off to t-,\u2019 Matt flinches at the thought, \u2018-ell and I know how you\u2019d feel about that,\u2019 he finishes. \u2018And I\u2019m not a doctor, not really. You should seek medical advice.\u2019 His words are undermined by the fact he\u2019s placed his hands on Matt\u2019s back and is helping him sit up.</p>\n<p>Matt smirks at him. \u2018I\u2019m fine. I\u2019ve had worse.\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018...You know, I think you\u2019re not lying and that is terrifying.\u2019 Matt manages to shift so his legs are over the side of the bed, just brushing the floor. \u2018What are you doing?\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018Leaving.\u2019</p>\n<p>Disbelieving silence greets Matt\u2019s words. Used to the sound of doubt, he pushes off the bed and stumbles as the pain hits him, feeling as if he\u2019s walked into a brick wall. His knees wobble, bucking under his weight but he manages to lock them. Focusing past the pain is hard but he\u2019s fought with injuries worse than this; he can walk it off. Slowly it comes together and he\u2019s left standing - on shaky limbs but standing nonetheless. He flashes a quick smirk at Banner and takes his first step.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s hard and his knees nearly buckle again but he makes it, even through the lightheadedness making his world sway. With a deep breath, he takes another step. And another. Another.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s halfway across the room before Banner seems to find his voice. \u2018Okay, you really are stubborn. Probably the stubbornest hero I\u2019ve had to marshal.\u2019 Matt ignores him again, too focused on the glass door he\u2019s ninety percent sure is right in front of him. \u2018Are you going to walk out wearing that?\u2019</p>\n<p>Banner\u2019s words cut into Matt\u2019s mind, a crash of thunder through the clouds in his thoughts. \u2018What?\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018Your suit. It\u2019s not exactly subtle.\u2019</p>\n<p>That causes Matt to turn, to give the appearance of looking at Banner. That\u2019s important to sighted people right? \u2018I wasn\u2019t after subtle. Needed a symbol.\u2019 He rocks a bit from the sudden spin but doesn\u2019t stumble.</p>\n<p>With slow measured steps, Banner moves across the room to stand before Matt. \u2018Good symbol. And good suit; it kept out the worst of the damage. You\u2019d be dead without it.\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018I know.\u2019 Matt turns his head, so Banner will think he\u2019s looking away. \u2018I need to leave.\u2019</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a long silence before Banner hums. \u2018Okay. Okay.\u2019 Relief floods Matt as he is <em> finally </em>listened to. He hears the shift of muscles as Banner looks him up and down. \u2018You\u2019re about Clint\u2019s height, I\u2019ll grab some of his clothes. Leave the mask on until you get to the street and you should be okay.\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018Thank you,\u2019 Matt says softly as Banner moves past him.</p>\n<p>He pauses in the doorway. \u2018Don\u2019t thank me yet. You\u2019re going to have to make it past the team first, before you can leave.\u2019</p>\n<p>He\u2019s gone before Matt can say that that\u2019s not what he\u2019s thanking him for.</p>\n<p>********</p>\n<p>Dressed in what Banner informs him are Clint\u2019s oldest and darkest clothes, Matt grabs the bag with his suit and stumbles his way towards the elevator. Every step is a touch easier than the last, his momentum doing as much to move him as his legs are. Sounds are bouncing off the glass along the hallway, the weird echoes this causes making his already swaying world a confusing mess of noise.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s almost at the elevator when a pounding heart registers at the edge of his hearing. Sniffing, Matt picks up sweat, graphite, and metal. Steve. He half turns back, reluctant to stop but aware he might have to.</p>\n<p>\u2018Daredevil!\u2019 Steve calls and Matt completes his turn with a sigh.</p>\n<p>\u2018Captain.\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018You\u2019re awake.\u2019 There\u2019s a note in Steve\u2019s voice, the same confused, disbelieving wonder that had coloured Banner\u2019s voice their entire conversation.</p>\n<p>\u2018Obviously,\u2019 Matt snaps out, spinning back to face the elevator and patting the wall for its button. He swallows a growl when he can\u2019t find it, realising he might be looking on the wrong side of the door for it.</p>\n<p>Steve takes a step towards him. \u2018Look, you\u2019re swaying. Can\u2026 can you come with me? Rest for a second? We\u2026 we want to talk. Please?\u2019</p>\n<p>The please cuts into Matt, right at the heart of the recently blinded little boy that read about the hero of the century who\u2019d been born more disabled than him and wanted nothing more than to be him. Even with everything Steve\u2019s done, or allowed to happen\u2026 Matt can\u2019t help but want to help his childhood hero.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s going to have to talk to the Avengers eventually. At least this way he\u2019ll get it over with and he might keep them out of Hell\u2019s Kitchen. \u2018Okay.\u2019</p>\n<p>Turning back to Steve causes the walls to spin with him, his head as heavy but yet light as it is when he\u2019s been drinking. He stumbles, the dizziness in his head somehow turning the muscles in his legs to mush.</p>\n<p>Someone\u2019s hands are on his arm, and he blinks as he realises he didn\u2019t hear or feel anyone moving. Steve, his mind provides, the scent of graphite combining with the feel of strong hands holding him up. Steve who moved down the hallway in the space of a stumble. How fast is Steve?</p>\n<p>\u2018Whoa, you okay?\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018I\u2019m fi-\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018Uh huh,\u2019 Steve cuts him off. \u00a0\u2018Come on, I\u2019ll help.\u2019 Steve throws the arm he\u2019s holding over his shoulders and Matt has no choice but to rest some - all - of his weight on Steve as they walk down the hallway together.</p>\n<p>Matt can hear the five heartbeats in the room Steve leads him to but none of them speak as he\u2019s helped to the leather couch on the far side of the room. Banner with his deep heartbeat is sitting on one of the armchairs, while the perfumed Black Widow has the other. Stark is by the bar with a glass of whiskey in hand, Clint is perched on top of it, and Falcon is behind it, pouring himself a drink by the scent of the open bottle of vodka. Only Thor is missing but Matt\u2019s not certain he was ever here tonight and sure anything he says will get passed along to the alien God. It\u2019s not like the Avengers can keep anything to themselves.</p>\n<p>\u2018How is he walking?\u2019 Falcon finally says, breaking the silence. \u2018He was half dead when he got here, how\u2019s he walking?\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018Forget walking, I wanna know his secret as to how he\u2019s awake,\u2019 Clint says.</p>\n<p>\u2018I can hear you, you know,\u2019 Matt snaps. \u2018I\u2019m b- I\u2019m not deaf.\u2019</p>\n<p>Silence drops over the room, smothering and heavy. Matt knows everyone is staring at him, the heat of their gazes boring into him but he just holds his heavy head as high as he can and waits. He\u2019s not going to make this easy for them.</p>\n<p>\u2018You\u2019re not deaf,\u2019 Steve says softly, \u2018but you made a bad call tonight.\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018And that\u2019s coming from someone who\u2019s made a few dumbass moves in his time.\u2019 Stark holds up his drink and toasts Matt. \u2018To Daredevil folks! The man who lived up to his name and made Captain America look sensible in the process.\u2019</p>\n<p>Steve whirs around to face Stark as Matt bristles and tries to rise. \u2018Tony!\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018Shutting up.\u2019</p>\n<p>The Black Widow rises from her seat in an almost silent movement, with only the click of her heels a sign she\u2019s moving. She pushes Matt back into his seat and takes a position on the couch beside him. He shuffles over, trying to put as much space between them as he can.</p>\n<p>\u2018You went in blind,\u2019 she says as she moves onto the arm of the couch. \u2018Willingly and knowingly went in blind, in unfamiliar territory and never once asked for backup. That\u2019s a ridiculously stupid move for a fighter and despite everything you\u2019re not a stupid fighter.\u2019 Matt feels his shoulders rising at the accidental insult in her words and consciously forces them down, swallowing the hiss as the movement pulls at a bruise. \u2018So there was another reason you went in.\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018Pride.\u2019 Stark gulps down his whiskey and slams the glass on the bar bench with a bang that\u2019s as loud as a gunshot to Matt\u2019s senses. \u2018You were too proud to ask for help and too proud to just walk away and leave a note like you\u2019ve done be-\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018How do you know that?\u2019 Matt can hear the collective beat of confusion in everyone\u2019s hearts. \u2018That I leave notes for the police,\u2019 he clarifies. \u2018How do you know?\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018J.A.R.V.I.S,\u2019 Stark says with a wave of his hand. \u2018My AI. He knows all. Looked up a few files related to you for me.\u2019</p>\n<p>Fire races through Matt at Stark careless disregard for the law he loves and whose spirit he defends with his blood and fists. \u2018That\u2019s illegal.\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018Says the <em> vigilante </em>.\u2019 Clint\u2019s disbelief is echoed in near silent laughs around the room.</p>\n<p>\u2018Just because I choose to act outside the law doesn\u2019t mean I condone others disregarding procedure and basic privacy laws.\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018You know, for an illiterate guy, you have a way with words.\u2019 Stark\u2019s words feel like a blow and Matt turns his head away. \u2018Good redirect there though. How about we let the good Captain get back to chewing you for risking your life over your damned pride.\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018I knew what I was doing,\u2019 Matt lies.</p>\n<p>Steve sighs. \u2018No you didn\u2019t. We\u2026 we found this in your pocket when we pulled you out.\u2019 He unfolds a piece of paper and Matt can smell the blood - his blood probably - on it. \u2018If you\u2019d been able to read this you\u2019d had know you were walking into a massive meeting of some of the highest ranking Hydra members that survived the fall of SHIELD.\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018It says that?\u2019</p>\n<p>Falcon is the one to shrug. \u2018Basically. A bit of reading between the li- oh. Sorry.\u2019 He moves out from behind the bar, to lean against it instead. \u2018Look man, I get it\u2019s embarrassing as hell. But we\u2019re not judging. And if you\u2019d just trusted us you wouldn\u2019t be here.\u2019</p>\n<p>Trusted them.</p>\n<p>TRUSTED THEM.</p>\n<p>\u2018Why?\u2019 Matt manages through the devil roaring in his veins and squeezing at his chest. \u2018Why should I have trusted you?\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018What?\u2019 they say, almost as a single voice.</p>\n<p>Matt struggles to his feet and holds his head as high as it can go. He clenches his fists in the hopes it\u2019ll hide the way his body is shaking with the effort needed to keep the devil down. \u2018What reason have you given me to trust you?\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018We could have help-\u2019 Clint starts.</p>\n<p>But Matt\u2019s had enough of being talked at. Time for them to learn to listen. \u2018No. My turn to talk. What reason do I have to trust you? You,\u2019 he points at Stark, \u2018treat me like I\u2019m something broken that needs fixing. You,\u2019 he says to the Black Widow, \u2018think I\u2019m incompetent because my skills are different to yours. None of you can manage to treat me like a person, now you\u2019ve come to the conclusion I\u2019m not like you. And all of you somehow think you know what\u2019s best for me despite knowing near <em> nothing </em>about me.</p>\n<p>\u2018So tonight, why would I have any reason to trust you? Why would I leave a note for police knowing I\u2019d be mocked and ridiculed for it and that they wouldn\u2019t act on it immediately because of your rumors? Why would I ask for help knowing I\u2019d be left behind at the first sign of danger because of your beliefs? Why would I expose myself to working with you knowing you think I\u2019m a complete <em> idiot\u2026 </em> a <em> retard </em>, because of something I cannot help?</p>\n<p>\u2018Why would I trust you to listen to me tonight when you\u2019ve not listened to me at all since you came to this conclusion?\u2019</p>\n<p>Matt\u2019s voice hasn\u2019t risen; he\u2019s not yelling. Instead he\u2019s been speaking with the steady but forceful voice he was trained to use in court, aware that a calm voice cuts far deeper than screamed words. But how he wishes he could scream, break the dead silence of this room with more than his measured words.</p>\n<p>\u2018You don\u2019t listen to me,\u2019 he repeats in a near whisper. \u2018So why the <em> FUCK </em> would I trust you,\u2019 he roars, the devil finally crawling free and raising his voice, \u2018when you can\u2019t even manage to listen to me about <em> my </em> needs and <em> my </em>abilities.\u2019</p>\n<p>He collects himself, forcing the devil back into his soul. Grabbing his bag, he races for the door as fast as his still shaking legs can manage.</p>\n<p>\u2018We\u2019re trying to help buddy,\u2019 Stark says, his voice a thunderclap in the silent room.</p>\n<p>\u2018Well don\u2019t,\u2019 Matt snaps, not slowing his sprinting steps. \u2018You\u2019re not helping because you\u2019re not listening to what I want and need. You\u2019re assuming you know best and it\u2019s even worse than if you hadn\u2019t helped at all.\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018But-\u2019</p>\n<p>To Matt\u2019s surprise, Steve cuts Stark off before he can. \u2018Stop Tony. Let him go.\u2019</p>\n<p>Relief floods Matt, followed by anger at the fact he\u2019s relieved. He reaches the doorway and pauses. \u2018Besides,\u2019 he says, a bubble of amusement rising in him, \u2018you\u2019re not even addressing the right problem.\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018What do you mean?\u2019 The Black Widow asks in a tone as measured as Matt\u2019s was.</p>\n<p>\u2018I\u2019m perfectly capable of reading.\u2019 With that last grenade lobbed, Matt stumbles to the elevator.</p>\n<p>The moment he\u2019s on the street, he pulls out his burner phone and presses at buttons with a prayer in his throat. <em> \u2018M-Daredevil?\u2019 </em> Foggy says as he picks up and Matt releases the tension in his limbs with his heartfelt thanks to God. \u2018 <em> What\u2019s wrong? It\u2019s nearly 4am!\u2019 </em></p>\n<p>\u2018I fucked up,\u2019 Matt whispers as he staggers to where he thinks there\u2019s an alleyway. \u2018Foggy I fucked up.\u2019</p>\n<p><em> \u2018Where are you?\u2019 </em> Foggy understands what he needs before Matt even finds the strength to voice it. I fucked up, come save me. Come be my hero.</p>\n<p>\u2018Tower.\u2019 Matt half walks, half falls into the alley, collapsing behind the dumpster. Not in it for once, go him. \u2018Alley.\u2019</p>\n<p>\n<em> \u2018Avenger Tower, nearby alleyway. Got it. On my way.\u2019 </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u2018Foggy-\u2019</p>\n<p><em> \u2018Yes? </em>\u2019 And Matt could weep in joy, he caught him before he hung up.</p>\n<p>\u2018Wear a mask. I\u2026 I think they have cameras. I fucked up.\u2019</p>\n<p><em> \u2018That is extremely worrying buddy. Who\u2019s they? </em> \u2019 Matt shakes his head, the devil that had been keeping him upright and focused has finally left and he feels like jelly, every limb sagging into the ground. He can\u2019t make himself explain, not through the weight on his chest. \u2018<em>Okay, I get it. You\u2019ll talk later </em>.\u2019</p>\n<p>Later. Yes. Later. When Foggy is here and he\u2019s finally safe. \u2018<em> Oh </em> Buddy\u2026 <em> I\u2019m coming. I promise. Just got a taxi, I\u2019ll be there so soon.\u2019 </em></p>\n<p>Through the foggy (ha!) haze of his thoughts, Foggy is a ray of sun, whispering in Matt\u2019s ear that he\u2019s coming and he\u2019ll be there soon. It\u2019s a comforting thought, like he\u2019s lying on his silk soft bed in the morning sun, Foggy\u2019s snores from the bed across from his\u2026 \u00a0</p>\n<p>Okay, he might have lost track of that metaphor.</p>\n<p>\u2018You don\u2019t say Buddy,\u2019 Foggy says. It dawns on Matt that he heard that with both ears. Instinctively he opens his eyes and swallows the panic at his dark world; still there after all these years. Then Foggy\u2019s putting his hands on Matt\u2019s shoulders, slipping down to grab his back. Matt mirrors the movement, clinging to Foggy as he pulls Matt to his feet with a groan from them both.</p>\n<p>\u2018You\u2019re heavier than you look.\u2019 Matt pats at Foggy\u2019s face in reply, relieved to feel the cloth of his old mask there. \u2018Yeah, I took your advice. Get this off,\u2019 he tugs at Matt\u2019s cowl and shoves it in the bag still hanging off one of Matt\u2019s shoulders, \u2018and we\u2019ll get you home.\u2019</p>\n<p>Home. Sounds nice.</p>\n<p>\u2018Yeah it does Buddy.\u2019</p>\n<p>*********</p>\n<p>For the week Matt\u2019s forbidden by Claire to do any patrols - argued down from two and halfway to five days before Foggy stepped in - there\u2019s no sign of any Avengers in Hell\u2019s Kitchen. Sure it\u2019s only a temporary thing, as they lick whatever minor wounds his words made to their conscience, Matt is careful the first night he steps out as Daredevil.</p>\n<p>And even more careful the next. And the next.</p>\n<p>When another week passes with no sign of an Avenger, he feels himself starting to relax. Maybe they\u2019ve decided he\u2019s too much of an idiot to work with? Could he dare to hope that much? As grating as it is to be considered stupid, he\u2019ll take any excuse not to have to work with them.</p>\n<p>Course it\u2019s then Steve tracks him down.</p>\n<p>********</p>\n<p>He finds Matt on a roof, listening to the city.</p>\n<p>Matt hears him coming blocks away, the steady heartbeat and metallic taste too distinct to be anyone else. But while some of the memories of that night have a fuzzy haze over them, the memory of the speed with which Steve can move is not. Running is pointless, Matt might be able to out hide Steve but he doubts he can keep moving long enough to outrun him for the rest of his life. Better to get this over with now.</p>\n<p>\u2018Captain,\u2019 he says and feels Steve pause, his sigh like a roaring wind in Matt\u2019s ears. \u2018I thought I asked you to stop helping.\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018You did.\u2019 There\u2019s guilt in every inch of Steve\u2019s body; from the way he\u2019s holding his shoulders to the soft breaths he\u2019s taking. \u2018And I\u2019m sorry I\u2019m ignoring your wishes. I just\u2026 I have something to say and then I\u2019ll go.\u2019</p>\n<p>Matt turns to face him, an eyebrow raised. \u2018Say it then.\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018We\u2019re sorry. ...I\u2019m sorry.\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018Is that it?\u2019 Matt manages to say over the hammering of his heart.</p>\n<p>Steve\u2019s heart is hammering away too, almost sounding like a band of drums by itself. \u2018I know. It\u2019s just words. And we all realise we fucked up.\u2019 Matt huffs in disbelief. \u2018We do. I\u2026 I remember what it\u2019s like to be ignored. To not be listened to\u2026 I remember being in your place and I\u2019m disgusted at myself for forgetting.</p>\n<p>\u2018And I just want to say\u2026 I\u2019m listening now. What do you need?\u2019</p>\n<p>Matt tilts his head, hearing no lie in Steve\u2019s voice nor sensing no lie in his body. He\u2019s telling the truth. Which is\u2026 interesting.</p>\n<p>Maybe Matt can work with this.</p>\n<p>\u2018Nothing,\u2019 Matt says and he senses Steve\u2019s nod. \u2018I need nothing from you. Right now there\u2019s nothing you can do for me I can\u2019t do myself and I don\u2019t trust you to help me beyond that.\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018Okay,\u2019 Steve says and there\u2019s no fight in his voice. \u2018If that changes, let us know.\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018I have Clint\u2019s number. Unless I call, stay out of my city.\u2019</p>\n<p>With a final nod, Steve walks away leaving Matt to follow his heartbeat out of Hell\u2019s Kitchen. He doesn\u2019t look back, he doesn\u2019t make a call and he goes straight for the boundary of the city.</p>\n<p>In short he obeys both the letter and the spirit of Matt\u2019s request.</p>\n<p>If they all do, Matt can definitely work with this. Work with them.</p>\n<p>Time will tell.</p>\n<p>Ringing silence reigns in the room as Daredevil storms out, his last words a late gunshot after a volley of gunfire. Clint can see how everyone\u2019s chests are heaving, as the force of Daredevil\u2019s words\u2026 no, the power of Daredevil\u2019s anguished voice, leaves everyone breathless. And sitting in Clint\u2019s mind are flashes; the split second of blind panic on Daredevil\u2019s face when asked to read a screen, him staring at a wall as they fought over him in that debriefing, silent as the grave...</p>\n<p>A figure in red seemingly about to be held up by a bloody hand around his throat, his arms loose and unmoving by his side, and his knees already starting a fall towards the ground as Clint\u2019s arrow leaves his bow.</p>\n<p>\u2018What the hell does he mean he\u2019s perfectly capable of reading?\u2019 Tony\u2019s voice is a whipcrack through the silence; loud and making everyone unprepared for it flinch. \u2018Seriously, what the hell?\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018Of the things he said,\u2019 Clint finds himself saying, his voice soft but a cutting edge that has Nat giving her equivalent of a wide eyed look, \u2018<em> that\u2019s </em> what you\u2019re focusing on?\u2019</p>\n<p>Tony blinks at Clint, his jaw creeping towards the ground. \u2018What do you mean? Out of everything he said that was th-\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018It was our fault,\u2019 Bruce interrupts, causing everyone\u2019s attention to snap to him. \u2018Daredevil\u2019s injuries. They were our fault. That\u2019s what you should have taken from what he said.\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018How\u2019d you figure that?\u2019 For all Tony\u2019s arrogance, there\u2019s a note of confusion in his voice. \u2018It\u2019s not our fault he made a stupid choice.\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018It is our fault he was in a position to make that choice in the first place,\u2019 Bruce <em> snaps </em>, and Clint takes an instinctive, sharp breath, dropping down from his perch on the bar so he can move back. Like a wave, his movement spreads through the room as everyone backs a step away from Bruce; standard practice in the risk of a Hulk event. Bruce insists.</p>\n<p>But he seems to have it under control, not even a hint of green in his face or body. He just stares at Tony for a long moment, then turns on his heel and storms out much like Daredevil did not minutes earlier.</p>\n<p>Maybe not so under control after all.</p>\n<p>Steve sighs, his body sagging as he collapses back onto the couch. \u2018We fucked up,\u2019 he says in a voice that should be a whisper but it carries in the silent room.</p>\n<p>\u2018Well, we might have made some unfortunate assumptions,\u2019 Tony says.</p>\n<p>\u2018We. Fucked. Up,\u2019 Steve says in his confident, frozen Captain America voice. He\u2019s <em> pissed </em>. \u2018We fucked up and to not admit to it is as bad as what we did in the first place.\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018Steve-\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018Do you know what it\u2019s like to be ignored?\u2019 Steve asks in a quiet voice, quieter than Clint\u2019s ever heard, that seems to echo in the room. \u2018Do you know what it\u2019s like to have your worth as a person, as a human, judged not by what you can do but by what you can\u2019t? Have you ever had anyone, subtly or overtly, tell you your skills and abilities are worth less because you\u2019re not capable of doing what everyone else is doing?\u2019</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a tension in the room, everyone holding their breaths at the depth of emotion, of empathy and <em> pain </em> in Steve\u2019s voice. \u2018I do. And\u2026 and I forgot. I let you make assumptions\u2026 I made assumptions myself, and that caused a good man, an ally\u2026 it caused Daredevil to experience what I swore I\u2019d use my new body to exterminate. So yeah. We fucked up. <em> I </em>fucked up and we\u2019re going to make sure it never happens again. We\u2019re going to make sure he gets what we denied him.\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018What was that?\u2019 Nat asks, her voice softer than anything Clint\u2019s ever heard from her.</p>\n<p>\u2018Respect. Respect for him, with no changes and no denials; no matter how hard we find it. Maybe then, we\u2019ll actually be the heroes we all claim to be.\u2019</p>\n<p>********</p>\n<p>Steve\u2019s speech - dramatic, yet to the point - knocks any fight out of Tony\u2026 of all of them. They drift to their floors to think, to remember\u2026</p>\n<p>To wait.</p>\n<p>Clint takes his aids out, fiddling with them as he sits on his bed and thinks. This is all his fault\u2026</p>\n<p>\n<em> \u2018Seriously though, what did you say to Daredevil Cap? He took off like a bat outa hell.\u2019 </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em> \u2018You\u2019re not funny Barton.\u2019 </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em> \u2018I\u2019m hilarious Stark.\u2019 </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em> \u2018I think he was embarrassed about being nervous of the bomb and misreading the timer.\u2019 </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em> \u2018Geez, Daredevil seems to have bad luck with written things\u2026\u2019 </em>\n</p>\n<p>Words have power, Clint knows that. Voices and sounds can make people do and think so much and for a lot of his life, he never quite got that. Spoken words are sometimes denied to him, even if he can work around the problem. The written word is and always been a sanctuary for him. But what does it mean to have that sanctuary and yet seemingly not be able to access it?</p>\n<p>He made the assumption Daredevil has issues with the written word. They made the collective assumption this was because he was illiterate. But he\u2019s not, he\u2019s said so. Which leaves only one option\u2026</p>\n<p>Clint\u2019s not the only \u2018superhero\u2019 with a disability out there.</p>\n<p>And he\u2019s the reason the other person is suffering.</p>\n<p>If he hadn\u2019t first put voice to an assumption, would it have lead to a theory? If he\u2019d not helped find evidence, would they have called it a conclusion? If he\u2019d spoken up a little louder, would Tony have been as obsessed with \u2018fixing\u2019 the \u2018problem\u2019?</p>\n<p>If he\u2019d been decent and stopped, just for a moment, to think, would he have realised he\u2019s not the only disabled superhero around in time to spare Daredevil from the cruelties of the ignorant?</p>\n<p>His hearing aids have no answers and turning them over and over in his hands only makes them warm.</p>\n<p>********</p>\n<p>Daredevil made it clear the moment he stormed out despite being barely able to walk, what he thinks of the Avengers. Clint doesn\u2019t blame him at all; even he screwed up, presuming to speak for the man despite knowing basically nothing about his needs. Just because Clint\u2019s deaf, doesn\u2019t mean he has the right to speak for anyone else. He might not have been as ableist as the others but he did still screw up.</p>\n<p>Leaving Daredevil alone until he\u2019s ready to talk is the hardest thing Clint\u2019s ever going to do. But he\u2019ll do it, because it\u2019s been made clear any other action is not helping.</p>\n<p>So walking into the common room the morning after Daredevil\u2019s dramatic exit, Clint feels something hot and heavy running through his veins at the sight of what Tony has on the screens.</p>\n<p>\u2018What are you doing?\u2019 He asks, in a voice he usually reserves for dangerous and insane marks.</p>\n<p>Tony barely glances at him, caught up as he is in the many images on the various screens that make up their ridiculous and somewhat over the top home entertainment system. \u2018Security camera footage. Cellphone photos. Artist renderings.\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018Daredevil,\u2019 Clint sums up, examining a photo of Daredevil in his old black suit, clearly taken from a dodgy security camera.</p>\n<p>\u2018Daredevil,\u2019 Tony confirms. \u2018He said he can read but somehow he can still figh-\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018You\u2019re an idiot,\u2019 Clint says with a growl and Tony turns to look at him outraged. \u2018Firstly, you\u2019re doing exactly what he called you out for last night and invading his privacy illegally.\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018He\u2019s a vigilante, that\u2019s not exactly a position he can argue legalities from.\u2019</p>\n<p>Clint swipes the picture he\u2019s examining away, pulling up one of the \u2018Information Wanted\u2019 posters that occasionally pop up, asking to bring in Daredevil. \u2018Are you going to turn him in? Because that\u2019s the only vaguely justifiable reason for you to break the law in pursuit of his identity.\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018I don\u2019t want to know who he is,\u2019 Tony lies, his eyes giving the deception away. \u2018I just want to know how he does what he does.\u2019</p>\n<p>Wait, how he fights? \u2018Like I do?\u2019 Clint says, confused. He buries the slight pain in his heart, not letting a flicker of it into his voice. He\u2019s not going to be hurt by Tony assuming disabled heroes need something extra to do their jobs, even when the problem doesn\u2019t affect their work.</p>\n<p>Tony blinks and gives Clint a perplexed look. \u2018What do you mean like you do? You can read, you\u2019ve never put your life in danger for pride. You\u2019r-\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018Disabled. Like he is. Did you miss that point last night?\u2019 Clint can\u2019t keep the note of complete disbelief out of his voice. He knows that sometimes Tony can be oblivious to things, can overlook the obvious when making enormous leaps of genius, but this has to take the cake. He\u2019s looking for something that doesn\u2019t exist in order to solve <em> the wrong problem </em>.</p>\n<p>\u2018Wait what? Disabled? But he\u2019s nearly a superhe-\u2019</p>\n<p>Disgust sinks into Clint\u2019s stomach and he turns with all the speed and grace his years of training can give him. \u2018If you think you can\u2019t have a disabled superhero Tony, you\u2019re not the man I thought you were, deep down.\u2019</p>\n<p>Behind him, he can almost hear the sound of Tony\u2019s brain whirring away, processing what must have been a bombshell to it, but Clint can\u2019t find it in himself to care.</p>\n<p>He walks into Steve on the way to his room, a collision only minor because of Steve\u2019s reflexes. \u2018Clint? You okay?\u2019 Clint raises an eyebrow at him and he smiles. \u2018Okay, bad question. What\u2019s up?\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018Stark. He ah, missed the implications of last night\u2019s little talk with our resident vigilante.\u2019 Steve\u2019s face drops and a hard glint comes into his eyes. \u2018He\u2019s looking over footage, trying to figure out how someone could both be able to read and not able to read; but also how they could fight in spite of it.\u2019 He laughs, a dead and unamused sound. \u2018I also think he\u2019s trying to track Daredevil down.\u2019</p>\n<p>The glint is now a glare. \u2018I\u2019ll talk with him. I\u2019ve already talked with Thor this morning though he at least seems to realise we screwed up.\u2019</p>\n<p>Clint bites his lip then adds, \u2018I think we should talk to Daredevil\u2026 make sure he realises we got it, what he said last night. And\u2026 and that we\u2019re going to change.\u2019</p>\n<p>Steve turns that hard glare onto Clint and for a moment he fights the urge to fidget under the patriotic glare of Captain America. Then his eyes lower and he nods. \u2018Yes, we should. I know he\u2019ll not want to see us but\u2026\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018But we need to talk to him.\u2019 Clint considers it then swallows. \u2018You go.\u2019 At Steve\u2019s raised eyebrow he elaborates, \u2018You\u2019re faster and I doubt he\u2019s going to be in the \u2018come and chat\u2019 mood. No way can I catch him in Hell\u2019s Kitchen, but you might have a shot.\u2018</p>\n<p>To Clint\u2019s relief, Steve gives him a careful nod. He manages to keep his shoulders raised and not sagging in delighted relief at the realisation he doesn\u2019t have to face Daredevil.</p>\n<p>Face what he did.</p>\n<p>********</p>\n<p>It takes Steve nearly three weeks to track Daredevil down.</p>\n<p>The first week is the worst, with no sightings of the horned vigilante leading Clint to internally panic about having killed the man. Only once he starts surfacing in the second week does this panic dissipate. It\u2019s probably the first time in Clint\u2019s life hearing about violent beatings and terrified crooks is a good thing.</p>\n<p>Okay, the terrified crooks are always a good thing. Violent beatings, not so much.</p>\n<p>Steve comes in the ninth night, practically marching with the resolve in steadiness of his shoulders and measured steps. Somehow it\u2019s a signal to the team, with everyone assembling in the common room - the very same one Daredevil had chewed them out in.</p>\n<p>\u2018You found the hornhead?\u2019 Tony asks, his eyes tight as he ignores everyone\u2019s stares.</p>\n<p>\u2018Yes. He had a message for us, about what he wants.\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018Finally! Give it to us.\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018Leave him alone.\u2019 Steve\u2019s words are like a lightning bolt into the room, everyone pausing and holding their breath as they wait for the thunder. \u2018He needs nothing from us, so we\u2019re to stay out of Hell\u2019s Kitchen unless he calls.\u2019</p>\n<p>It\u2019s silent for a long moment, two. Then the thunder comes, in the form of Tony speaking. \u2018So wait, what if we have business in Hell\u2019s Kitchen? Do I have to avoid that whole ten blocks on my commute or is that a free pass?\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018He means,\u2019 Nat says, her words precise and bitten off, \u2018that he wants the Avengers to stay out of Hell\u2019s Kitchen. Tony Stark can go as he pleases; Iron Man is not welcome.\u2019</p>\n<p>Tony opens his mouth to speak but Thor beats him to it, his booming voice one no one could speak over. \u2018It is a difficult request to honour, to ignore a shield brother we have caused such pain to but it is his request?\u2019 Steve nods and Thor returns it. \u2018Then it would be a dishonour if we were to ignore his desire. What form shall the call take?\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018Clint\u2019s phone,\u2019 Steve says.</p>\n<p>\u2018Ah, the cellular devices. Reasonable.\u2019</p>\n<p>With that, Thor walks out. It\u2019s clear he sees the issue as simple and solved. Until Daredevil calls, leave him alone. Easy.</p>\n<p>Clint just hopes it is.</p>\n<p>*********</p>\n<p>It\u2019s not easy.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s not about not being able to follow Steve\u2019s orders - Daredevil\u2019s really, just passed to them by Steve - and staying out of Hell\u2019s Kitchen. Staying away from Daredevil. It\u2019s about the personalities they have, and how they deal with problems. Namely that waiting to confront one is not a solution any Avenger would think of.</p>\n<p>Clint\u2019s never been one to think much on his decisions or actions, much to his teammates\u2019 displeasure. Given a choice, Clint would rather act than choose to wait.</p>\n<p>An odd mindset for a marksman and a sniper but Clint\u2019s never claimed to be \u2018normal\u2019.</p>\n<p>And he\u2019s not alone. None of the Avengers are the type to run from a problem; if they were they probably wouldn\u2019t be here. Bruce runs to protect people from himself, taking the problem with him to solve alone; Tony will seem to ignore the problem until either he has a solution or it\u2019s no longer a problem; Steve and Thor have never heard of this \u2018running\u2019 you speak of; Sam does everything Steve does but slower; and Nat\u2026 well Nat causes problems or solves them, she doesn\u2019t run.</p>\n<p>Clint, he\u2019s just too dumb to run and too impulsive to think of it anyway..</p>\n<p>But Clint knows this time confronting the problem isn\u2019t going to help unless they confront the right one. And right now, Daredevil - he has no right to call him Mike, not anymore - has made it clear it\u2019s all of them.</p>\n<p>Well, that\u2019s what Clint thinks until he gets the call a month after Daredevil\u2019s demands.</p>\n<p>********</p>\n<p>Clint doesn\u2019t check the caller ID before answering, aware the only people with his number are his teammates who are all here, as far as he knows. \u2018You know I\u2019m in the kitchen right? Just ask J.A.R.V.I.S where I am, I\u2019m sure he knows.\u2019</p>\n<p>Nothing but silence greets him, so complete that Clint finds himself checking that yes he has his aids in and yes there\u2019s a call, he\u2019s not ima- Oh.</p>\n<p>The caller ID reads <em> Daredevil. </em>\u2018Daredevil? You there?\u2019</p>\n<p>\n<em> \u2018Ah, yes. I am. Guessing from that you\u2019re not busy then?\u2019 </em>\n</p>\n<p>Confused delight spreads through Clint, a warmness that has him smiling. \u2018Not overly, no. Just debating if stealing Tony or Nat\u2019s food will be more amusing.\u2019 Both are notoriously territorial over their food and likely to kill Clint for stealing it. Well, Nat is. Hmm, maybe better to steal Tony\u2019s then; less risk of bloody death. \u2018What do you need?\u2019</p>\n<p><em> \u2018I have\u2026 I got word,\u2019 </em> he says, frustration clear in every syllable, <em> \u2018of a shipment into Hell\u2019s Kitchen. Old weapons and technology, stolen during the fall of SHIELD. </em> \u2019 Something cold races through Clint\u2019s veins at the thought of half of the things SHIELD had in their armoury loose on the streets of Hell\u2019s Kitchen. <em> \u2018I interrupted it,\u2019 </em> Daredevil continues and there\u2019s an amused note in his voice at the understatement, \u2018 <em> but now I have containers of items I cannot leave but there\u2019s too much for me to take.\u2019 </em></p>\n<p>\u2018What do you need then?\u2019</p>\n<p>A long pause then, \u2018<em> Someone\u2026 someone trustworthy to help me destroy as much of this as I can without risking lives.\u2019 </em></p>\n<p>Clint has to grin. \u2018You want me to come destroy shit? Hell yeah! Where am I going?\u2019 He can\u2019t keep the delight out of his voice and doesn\u2019t try to. This, this is definitely his thing.</p>\n<p>Daredevil rattles off an address, right in the centre of Hell\u2019s Kitchen. Which tempers Clint\u2019s delight\u2026 quite a lot actually. Some of the SHIELD tech is dangerous and prone to blowing up; SHIELD always kept their weapons secured. And now it\u2019s sitting in the middle of an urban population, guarded only by a guardian devil.</p>\n<p>\u2018I\u2019m there. Don\u2019t move anything if you can.\u2019 Clint pauses then adds, \u2018It\u2019ll just be me, un-\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018<em> That\u2019s all I want.\u2019 </em></p>\n<p>\u2018Then that\u2019s all you\u2019ll get.\u2019</p>\n<p>*********</p>\n<p>Daredevil\u2019s left the door to the apartment - one of maybe ten in the building, one of the nicer and definitely not abandoned ones around - ajar. Clint slips in, having made it to Hell\u2019s Kitchen in record time.</p>\n<p>\u2018Took you long enough,\u2019 Daredevil says, his back to the door as he runs a careful hand over one of the many boxes crowding the apartment. It\u2019s a nice place; bare of any furniture in order to have space for all the boxes. So many boxes. Clint didn\u2019t think SHIELD had this much tech lying around to be stolen honestly.</p>\n<p>\u2018Well, you know traffic this time of night,\u2019 Clint quips back. \u2018And you\u2019d have looked a right idiot if that wasn\u2019t me.\u2019</p>\n<p>Daredevil cocks his head, giving Clint the distinction impression he\u2019s smiling. \u2018Knew it was you.\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018Bullshit,\u2019 Clint jokes as he kneels down beside Daredevil. \u2018What have we got?\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018This crate is guns, I think,\u2019 Daredevil says as he stands. \u2018Most of them are. Those I can deal with myself, or leave for the police.\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018Lead me to what you need my help with. That\u2019s why I\u2019m here. To help.\u2019 Clint straightens too, reading over the labels on random boxes. He pauses, noting a pale blue label on a black background. Why does that look familiar?</p>\n<p>\u2018Clint?\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018What\u2019s that one, labeled lab parts?\u2019 Daredevil shifts to stand beside it and together they get it onto the floor and open. Clint hisses in anger at the sight of glass vials, sitting innocently and wrapped only in bubble wrap.</p>\n<p>Daredevil cocks his head. \u2018What\u2019s wrong?\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018Biological samples. In <em> bubble wrap </em>. Are they nuts?\u2019 Clint can\u2019t help the anger racing through him leaking into his voice. Oh God this has suddenly become a thousand times worse. As far as he can see none of the vials have been broken, but that\u2019s only what he can visually confirm; the sheer amount of bubble wrap is distorting everything to the point where he can barely tell that the liquid in the vials is a deep, dark red. He\u2019s going to end up in a decontamination shower, he knows it. Or worse.</p>\n<p>\u2018Wouldn\u2019t they be dead without refrigeration?\u2019 Surprise races through Clint at Daredevil\u2019s insightful comment, followed quickly by shame at his surprise.</p>\n<p>\u2018Not if they\u2019ve been engineered to not need it. Which-\u2019 Clint trails off, shame choking at his words.</p>\n<p>\u2018Which SHIELD did,\u2019 Daredevil finishes. \u2018Get them out of my city,\u2019 he growls.</p>\n<p>Clint nods. \u2018I\u2019ll call\u2026 I\u2019ll call the FBI; the CDC. Everyone. Your choice if you stay or go\u2026\u2019 If these have been opened we\u2019re both dead, he thinks but doesn\u2019t say.</p>\n<p>Somehow Daredevil knows what he\u2019s thinking. \u2018They\u2019re not broken.\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018What?\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018The vials. None of them are broken. And this is the only box in here that doesn\u2019t hold some form of weapon.\u2019</p>\n<p>Blinking in confusion, Clint turns to stare at him. \u2018How can you tell?\u2019 he asks in a mild but confused voice. A second later he realises he just doubted Daredevil and his heart picks up in fear and disgust.</p>\n<p>To his surprise, Daredevil just smiles. \u2018I can tell. I\u2019ll\u2026 I\u2019ll leave. Get myself decontaminated.\u2019 He bites his lip, looking uncertain, then rises.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s halfway out the door before Clint can get an answer to his lips. \u2018You have a decontamination shower?\u2019 he manages to say and that gets Daredevil to pause.</p>\n<p>\u2018No, but I\u2019ll do my best anyway.\u2019</p>\n<p>*********</p>\n<p>It\u2019s five in the morning, a mere half hour from sunrise before Clint manages to escape the clutches of the CDC. Daredevil\u2019s claim proves to be true; none of the other crates have biological samples and none of the ones they do have have broken. They\u2019re also, on a second examination, blood samples not viruses. Still dangerous but not as dangerous as first thought.</p>\n<p>Clint manages to avoid a decontamination shower.</p>\n<p>Pleased with his luck and skills, he decides to take the short way back to the Tower, racing along the roofs of Hell\u2019s Kitchen. It\u2019s been too long since he used his Parkour skills and he\u2019s starting to see why this is Daredevil\u2019s prefered method of transport. The roofs here are a lot more fun to play on than the ones near the Tower - and with less grumpy rich people.</p>\n<p>Two blocks from the building he spots a figure in black, hiding from the rising sun in the last shadows of the night. He finds himself stopping even before it fully registers in his mind, slowing his movements so he stops on that roof.</p>\n<p>\u2018Daredevil?\u2019 He asks and the figure half steps out of the shadows. It\u2019s enough for him to see it is Daredevil, wearing his old \u2018Devil of Hell\u2019s Kitchen\u2019 get up. \u2018Gone back to the old days?\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018Figured I didn\u2019t need my suit right now. I\u2019m not expecting a fight.\u2019 His voice is soft and nowhere as deep as usual. \u2018You\u2019re alright?\u2019 There\u2019s also a note of amusement in his question, as if-</p>\n<p>Clint groans. \u2018You knew it was blood not viruses, didn\u2019t you?\u2019</p>\n<p>Daredevil shrugs but his lips twitch. Asshole is seconds from smiling, Clint can tell.. \u2018I had an inkling.\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018I was worried.\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018I know.\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018This is revenge, isn\u2019t it?\u2019</p>\n<p>It\u2019s the wrong thing to say. Daredevil\u2019s shoulders stiffen, his head tilts up and his breathing picks up. \u2018Revenge?\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018For fucking up,\u2019 Clint says. \u2018Because I seriously fucked up and you\u2019re welcome to as much revenge as you want because I deserve it.\u2019</p>\n<p>Daredevil\u2019s head tilts, his shoulders dropping slightly. \u2018You know what you did wrong.\u2019</p>\n<p>It\u2019s not a question but Clint answers anyway. \u2018Yes. I know. I might\u2026 I might not have done what the others did but I spoke for you and I fucked up.\u2019 He gathers all his courage into a deep breath and whispers, \u2018I\u2019m sorry.\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018Okay.\u2019</p>\n<p>He turns on his heels and walks directly towards the rising sun. Clint tries to follow his path but the sun bites at his vision and he throws up an arm to shield himself. By the time he gets his arm into a position where he can see what\u2019s happening and still have shade, Daredevil is gone.</p>\n<p>*********</p>\n<p>Thus starts a somewhat unusual period of Clint\u2019s life.</p>\n<p>Well almost as unusual as the period of his life where he\u2019s the deaf, ex-carnie on a team of superheroes who regularly save the world. Though since he is still that life period, does this count as being a part of that period of his life?</p>\n<p>Okay, metaphor got away from him there. Anyway, things get odd. Daredevil - \u2018call me Mike, Clint, I said that was fine.\u2019 - doesn\u2019t call a lot but he does call. Most of the calls boil down to: \u00a0\u2018I\u2019m about to go beat someone up who\u2019s bigger than me and my people worry. Wanna come beat them up with me so my people will worry less?\u2019.</p>\n<p>Clint\u2019s not one to say no to beating people up in the name of justice. It\u2019s a hell of a lot better than killing them, and he\u2019s done his fair share of that; sometimes for the wrong people (SHIELD is now the wrong people, and it hurts more than anything so Clint ignores it). No one comments on his bi-weekly or monthly disappearance act, but Clint\u2019s not dumb enough to think it goes unnoticed.</p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t care though. He\u2019s too busy hanging with D- Mike, who turns out to both have a wicked sense of humour and possibly be a complete <em> dork </em>.</p>\n<p>Clint\u2019s never felt so delighted to be making a friend. Even when it leads to situations like this.</p>\n<p>\u2018You alive down there?\u2019 Mike asks, amusement in his voice as he peeks over the lip of the dumpster to look down at Clint.</p>\n<p>\u2018Laugh all you want, I\u2019m where I meant to be.\u2019 Struggling to sit up, Clint takes the hand offered to him. \u2018Better in the garbage than a pancake on the ground.\u2019 With a groan, Mike hauls him out of the dumpster and they stumble to the ground.</p>\n<p>\u2018Man, I\u2019m glad we\u2019re alone right now.\u2019 Looking around, Clint realises he\u2019s not actually sure that\u2019s right. \u2018We are alone right now, right?\u2019</p>\n<p>Mike lowers his head for a second, a moment Clint\u2019s seen a thousand times before then nods. \u2018We\u2019re alone.\u2019 He tilts his head then adds, \u2018Well except for the assholes you let sneak up on yo-\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018I did not let them sneak up on me!\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018Then why\u2019d they push you off the roof?\u2019</p>\n<p>Clint sniffs, outraged. \u2018I wasn\u2019t pushed, I jumped. Be-\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018Yeah, I know. \u00a0A piece of garbage than alleyway pancake.\u2019</p>\n<p>Smirking, Clint goes to throw an arm over Mike\u2019s shoulder but the man dodges away in a smooth and rapid motion. \u2018Oh no. Your garbage self stays over there.\u2019 Smirking even more, Clint takes another step towards him.</p>\n<p>Mike\u2019s halfway up the fire escape in the next breath, Clint right on his heels. It turns into a game of chase that Mike easily wins, vanishing into the darkness of Hell\u2019s Kitchen.</p>\n<p>Defeated, Clint takes a seat on the edge of a roof and starts talking. He knows Mike\u2019s not far off but he\u2019s beginning to think Mike\u2019s hearing is such that he\u2019d hear him even if he wasn\u2019t close.</p>\n<p>Clint\u2019s vaguely envious. \u2018So I\u2019ve been thinking a bit recently - don\u2019t laugh, I know you\u2019re laughing. Don\u2019t need to see you to know you\u2019re laughing. Anyway, I\u2019ve been thinking that, if you want and I understand if you don\u2019t, but maybe you should meet Thor. I know you\u2019re still mad at them and they deserve it - I do too - but Thor\u2019s a golden retriever in human form and he\u2026 he doesn\u2019t judge.</p>\n<p>\u2018Mostly because I don\u2019t think Asgard has some of our world\u2019s hangups about abilities and disabilities for warriors - what he calls us, not my word - but it\u2019s kinda refreshing anyway.\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018Bring him,\u2019 Mike says, and Clint jumps. Mike\u2019s there though, grabbing his shoulders and stopping him making a second roof jump tonight.</p>\n<p>Heart pounding with his near escape, Clint smiles up at him. \u2018Thanks.\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018Welcome. Bring him,\u2019 Mike repeats. \u2018I\u2019ll meet him.\u2019</p>\n<p>He\u2019s gone in the next second, sprinting across the next roof. Clint doesn\u2019t chase him this time.</p>\n<p>********</p>\n<p>Thor takes one look at Mike and beams. \u2018Ah, you are the warrior Daredevil! I have heard your skill in battle is matched only by your skill with words!\u2019</p>\n<p>Though the mask hides his eyes from view, Clint gets the impression Mike is blinking in confusion. \u2018Ah. Thanks?\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018You have no need to thank me, I speak only what has been spoken to me. Now, are we to find a glorious battle in this Kitchen of Hel\u2019s or pass our night in the glorious exploit of \u2018Parkour\u2019.\u2019</p>\n<p>Clint bites his lip to try and help swallow the laugh bubbling up his throat. Sometimes he could swear Thor plays up the \u2018alien from a warrior culture\u2019 just for the reaction he gets. But then sometimes he seems genuine and Clint starts to doubt himself.</p>\n<p>Mike seems thrown. \u2018Ah, battle? Though you\u2019re not exactly subtle-\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018Says the man wearing <em> horns </em>.\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018It\u2019s a symbol,\u2019 Mike snaps, a smile on his face at the familiar argument. \u2018And Thor, call me Mike?\u2019 He starts to run for the next roof. Without prompting, Clint follows.</p>\n<p>\u2018Michael. You honour me with your name.\u2019 Thor\u2019s thunderous steps follow them and Clint steps aside so he can pass and Clint can see what happens next.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s not what he expects.</p>\n<p>Mike <em> stumbles </em>, his usual grace disappearing at the sound of his full name in Thor\u2019s booming voice. He\u2019s fortunate that he\u2019s still a few feet from the edge of the roof, but it\u2019s still the most thrown Clint\u2019s ever seen him - well, since that night.</p>\n<p>\u2018Mike,\u2019 he corrects, turning to face the confused Thor.</p>\n<p>\u2018Michael, yes.\u2019</p>\n<p>Frustration appears in Mike\u2019s voice. \u2018No, Mike. Please listen to me.\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018...I have dishonoured your wishes. My most sincere and deepest of apologies\u2026 Mike.\u2019</p>\n<p>Mike\u2019s shoulders drop and his chest heaves; he seems relieved. \u2018Okay.\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018Why not Michael? If I can ask?\u2019 Clint asks, drawing Mike\u2019s attention.</p>\n<p>He shrugs. \u2018It\u2019s\u2026 it\u2019s a loaded name for me. I\u2019d prefer not to answer to it.\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018But it\u2019s not your actual name.\u2019</p>\n<p>Mike smirks. \u2018Not even close,\u2019 and Clint\u2026 Clint somehow gets the feeling he\u2019s lying.</p>\n<p>\u2018Come on then,\u2019 Mike says, \u2018if I\u2019m to find you a glorious battle.\u2019</p>\n<p>The sight of the three of them ends up scaring off every criminal they come across, often before they\u2019re even in speaking distance. Finally a laughing Mike sends Clint for what he calls \u2018decent pizza\u2019 which they eat on the edge of a building that Mike says no one\u2019ll care they\u2019re on.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s a good night.</p>\n<p>********</p>\n<p>Pizza nights with Thor become a weekly ritual when possible - Thor won\u2019t let it be anything less. Mike jokes that he appreciates the break as every criminal in the city seems to disappear into their bolt holes the moment Thor enters Hell\u2019s Kitchen. No one wants to face an annoyed thunder God - even if Mike and Thor sometimes end up <strike>arguing</strike> <em>talking </em>religion.</p>\n<p>It turns out that Mike is a devout Catholic. How the fuck that works, Clint\u2019ll never know but it leads to some interesting conversations. Whatever issues Mike has with written words, it\u2019s clearly not stopping him reading a variety of things - he has a fondness for twentieth century political figures, especially this one judge - that he loves to quote when arguing. Completely lost on Thor, who\u2019s still working his way through Disney movies, but making Clint more and more sure the Avengers did Mike a huge disservice when they made the ridiculous leap from \u2018has issues reading screens and words\u2019 to \u2018illiterate\u2019.</p>\n<p>More than a disservice, they were ableist assholes.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s heavy thinking and Clint\u2019s starting to make his peace with the fact that Mike\u2019s probably never going to trust them ever again.</p>\n<p>And that\u2019s fine.</p>\n<p>********</p>\n<p>\u2018Mike! Thought we agreed pizza night tomorrow?\u2019</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a dazed silence on the other end of the line, one so similar to the first call that Clint\u2019s already reaching to check his aids are in. \u2018<em> Clint?\u2019 </em></p>\n<p>\u2018Mike. What\u2019s wrong?\u2019</p>\n<p><em> \u2018I...I think I need a doctor.\u2019 </em> Clint can barely hear him and he\u2019s not sure if that\u2019s his hearing or because Mike\u2019s actually that silent. \u2018 <em> I\u2019m\u2026 I need a doctor. </em>\u2019</p>\n<p>Clint\u2019s already moving through the Tower, headed for the labs. \u2018Thought you said you had someone to patch you up.\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018<em> Did. Gone.\u2019 </em></p>\n<p>\u2018Gone?\u2019 Clint\u2019s veins must be full of ice, judging by the cold racing through him.</p>\n<p>\n<em> \u2018Family. Out of town.\u2019 </em>\n</p>\n<p>Relief floods Clint, so strong it makes his legs wobble for a moment. \u2018Okay Mike. Would you like Bruce to come?\u2019</p>\n<p>A considering silence fills the line. If he says no, Clint\u2019s going to go himself because Mike sounds awful and he\u2019s <em> asking for help </em> . That <em> never </em> happens. \u2018 <em> Okay. </em>\u2019</p>\n<p>Clint\u2019s knees couldn\u2019t hold a feather right now, let alone him. At least not by the way they\u2019re wobbling, almost making him too weak to stand. He staggers into the lab, where Bruce looks up from an experiment.</p>\n<p>\u2018Clint? What\u2019s-\u2019</p>\n<p>He holds out the phone. \u2018Daredevil. He needs a doctor, wants you.\u2019</p>\n<p>Bruce takes the phone without pausing. \u2018You know I\u2019m not a licenced practitioner, right?\u2019 His face spasms as Mike speaks. \u2018Okay, I can be there in fifteen minutes. Your friend\u2019s conscious? Okay, keep doing that and make sure you don\u2019t neglect your own injuries - yes, I can tell you\u2019re injured too. I know your type.\u2019 He hangs up and passes the phone to Clint.</p>\n<p>\u2018You\u2019re going?\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018Alone,\u2019 Bruce says, a hint of the Hulk\u2019s growl in his voice.</p>\n<p>Clint holds his hands up. \u2018Hey, not arguing that. I\u2019ll be distraction, you go save our Devil.\u2019</p>\n<p>********</p>\n<p>It turns out Bruce didn\u2019t really need Clint to play distraction as later, after hearing about the call, Tony tries and fails to track Bruce on various hacked cameras. He\u2019s a ghost though, disappearing almost as quickly as Mike can and his stubborn refusal to even reveal the <em> address </em> he went to, let alone the injuries Mike had means Tony gets absolutely no new information for his search.</p>\n<p>Neither does Clint, but he can\u2019t be assed to care. If Mike wants to tell him, he will. Something he tells Mike, three pizza nights later, when asked if he\u2019ll be dropping in unannounced at Mike\u2019s place of work.</p>\n<p>\u2018That would mean I knew where you worked,\u2019 Clint says through a mouth full of the best pizza he\u2019s ever had.</p>\n<p>\u2018But if you know where I live, surely you can figure out where I work?\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018Don\u2019t,\u2019 Clint grunts, annoyed at having to give attention to this talking thing when pizza. Beside him, Thor is happily hacking his way through his third pizza, charged straight to Tony Stark\u2019s credit card. Clint wonders if he even notices the weekly charges.</p>\n<p>Mike stops. \u2018You don\u2019t?\u2019</p>\n<p>Clint swallows his pizza and resists the urge to eat more before he\u2019s said his bit. \u2018Nope. Bruce won\u2019t tell anyone anything. We\u2019ve not even got confirmation you live in Hell\u2019s Kitchen as Bruce lost any camera trails Tony threw at him within a block of the Tower. He\u2019s <em> good </em>.\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018Did you want to know?\u2019</p>\n<p>With a shrug, Clint steals the last slice of pepperoni from Mike\u2019s box. \u2018Don\u2019t care. If you wanna tell me, you will but until then, I\u2019m happy so long as you keep finding pizza like this, sweet baby Jesus.\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018Blasphemy,\u2019 Mike mocks but there\u2019s more delight in his voice than their usual joke could ever generate.</p>\n<p>\u2018I\u2019m a heathen,\u2019 Clint agrees through another mouth full of pizza.</p>\n<p>\u2018Your manners certainly are.\u2019 He pauses then adds, \u2018If Dr Banner wants to come into the city, I\u2019m not going to chase him out.\u2019</p>\n<p>Clint pauses. \u2018Want me to pass on the message?\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018If you could.\u2019</p>\n<p>A part of Clint really wants to know what happened that night, to make Mike so accepting but he\u2019s also certain asking will get him nowhere. \u2018I\u2019ll invite him to pizza night.\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018Only if your manners improve; you\u2019re not fit for civilised company.\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018And what\u2019s Thor then?\u2019 Clint roars, slapping the Norse God on the shoulder.</p>\n<p>Thor looks at Mike over Clint\u2019s head. Then they both look at Clint and say, \u2018Uncivilised company.\u2019</p>\n<p>Clint\u2019s laughter startles a flock of sleeping pigeons into a nighttime flight.</p>\n<p>********</p>\n<p>The only downside to Mike removing his restriction on Bruce, is the effect it has on Steve. Of all of them, he\u2019s the one person who seems to be taking what happened as more than the personal failure it was. To him, it\u2019s not just a personal failure but a sign that perhaps he\u2019s allowed the power of his transformation to go to his head.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s been moping around the Tower. It\u2019s kinda awful.</p>\n<p>\u2018Seriously awful.\u2019</p>\n<p>Mike ducks under the punch of the mugger he\u2019s fighting and kicks his legs out from under him. Another punch delivered to the face, and the mugger is out for the count. \u2018And [I? bye?] care?\u2019 he calls up to Clint, tilting his head to make his lips visible. Clint, perched on the side of the building above Mike so he can watch for cops, is grateful. Tony\u2019s <strike> repairing </strike> upgrading his aids tonight which is good for tomorrow but bad for right now. At least his skills in lipreading are still (mostly) intact.</p>\n<p>\u2018Oh you shouldn\u2019t,\u2019 Clint calls back, sure his voice is near silent. It doesn\u2019t seem to matter to Mike, who\u2019s responding no matter how loud Clint tries to pitch his voice, so he\u2019s been speaking faintly to avoid accidental yelling. \u2018Just saying. I never realised a grown man could be so <em> guilty </em>. You\u2019d think he was Tony not Steve, in terms of what he thinks he did.\u2019</p>\n<p>That gets a heaving chest that\u2019s probably Mike laughing as he climbs up to Clint\u2019s level. \u2018Police[\u2019ll???] [be bee?] here [in] a minute. Sirens,\u2019 he adds, after Clint\u2019s bemused look. \u2018Okay [maybe?] five minutes. [They\u2019re? There? Their?] not hurrying so [we?? we\u2019ll?] have time [to?] escape.\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018Nice of \u2018em,\u2019 Clint mutters as he follows Mike over the roofs.</p>\n<p>Mike doesn\u2019t reply until they\u2019re seated on a different roof - the same one they had their first and honestly the majority of their pizza parties on. Clint\u2019s sure it\u2019s near Mike\u2019s home but hasn\u2019t bothered to ask. \u2018Some of [them?] like [me? be?],\u2019 he says from his seat on the edge of the roof, sitting sidewards so he\u2019s facing Clint. \u2018A [few? ewe? you?] less since your rumours, but some.\u2019</p>\n<p>Clint doesn\u2019t manage to hide his flinch at the reminder of what they did. \u2018If I said sorry again would it be annoying or what you want to hear?\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018Bit of both,\u2019 Mike admits, his lips quirking upwards. \u2018But [by? bye?] all means, feel [free? tree?] to apologise endlessly.\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018If I wanted to do that, I\u2019d get Steve in here. He\u2019s the one feeling a world of guilt right now.\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018Are [you? ewe?] trying to [guilt maybe?] trip me?\u2019 Mike asks, his shoulders hunching forward and his nostrils flaring.</p>\n<p>\u2018Shit. No. No, no, no. I\u2019m going to shut up now.\u2019 Clint waves his arms round and isn\u2019t surprised when he starts to signs what he\u2019s saying. Mike\u2019s already mentioned he can\u2019t seem to get the hang of sign, apologies in every part of his body, so Clint barely cares that Mike doesn\u2019t even look at the gestures.</p>\n<p>\u2018Good.\u2019 There\u2019s a long pause that leaves Clint fidgeting on his ledge while Mike taps his fingers on the knee of the leg dangling over the edge. \u2018[How\u2019s?] Steve\u2019s Parkour?\u2019</p>\n<p>A smile starts to creep across Clint\u2019s face. \u2018Pretty good for a ninety year old.\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018We\u2019re better [though? bow?] [?]\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018Loads.\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018Better bring him to check then.\u2019</p>\n<p>********</p>\n<p>The first thing Steve does when they\u2019re on the same roof, two days later, is march up to Mike and say, \u2018I\u2019m sorry. We-\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018Don\u2019t apologise for your teammates Captain,\u2019 Mike snaps, cutting Steve off. \u2018If they\u2019re not willing to say it, they don\u2019t get you to say it for them.\u2019</p>\n<p>Steve looks down, nodding. \u2018I am still deeply regretful of my actions.\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018Good.\u2019 Mike walks towards the edge of the roof, keeping his back to Steve. \u2018One day I might trust you mean that.\u2019</p>\n<p>With that, he takes a few steps back then charges at the edge of the roof, jumping moments before he runs out of space. Landing on the next building with a neat somersault, he\u2019s on his feet in a graceful move that always makes Clint envious.</p>\n<p>\u2018Come on then Steve,\u2019 Mike calls and Steve stands taller, his eyes brightening, \u2018show us what you\u2019re made of!\u2019</p>\n<p>*********</p>\n<p>Parkour with Steve only happens once in a blue moon, when Mike\u2019s feeling a bit playful and Steve\u2019s available to do it. Steve loves every moment of it, often saying various versions of: \u2018This is like the assault courses we had to do in training! With less mud.\u2019 and somehow not sounding like a grumpy old man when he says it.</p>\n<p>Sam comes along once, at Mike\u2019s request. He goes to copy Steve\u2019s apology but Mike cuts him off before he starts.</p>\n<p>\u2018I told Steve, and I\u2019ll tell you. Your words are meaningless and you have to stop taking the blame for your teammates.\u2019</p>\n<p>Holding up his hands, Sam says, \u2018Hey, I\u2019ve said before, I do what he does just slower, apologies included.\u2019 He lowers his hands slowly with a sigh, \u2018And I do need to majorly apologise. I\u2019ve been trained to deal with this stuff, to realise when I\u2019m being ableist. Shouldn\u2019t have left my training at the door when I got involved with this mob.\u2019</p>\n<p>Mike eyes him, as if examining his insides. Clint\u2019s not a hundred percent sure, but he thinks whatever disability Mike has, it\u2019s something to do with his vision. Little things, like his occasional failure to track movement with his eyes, and the way he rarely seems to react to facial expressions, combine with the almost opaque eye coverings, to form this conclusion. He\u2019s not going to voice it aloud; he\u2019s already made that mistake and isn\u2019t going to repeat it. Clint tries to avoid repeating mistakes.</p>\n<p>Course, Clint could be wrong and it\u2019s something completely different. Doesn\u2019t matter, he\u2019s not going to change his behaviour either way. Been there, fucked that up spectacularly.</p>\n<p>Anyway, Mike finally stops eyeing off Sam, for whatever amount of eyeing he\u2019s capable of. \u2018Feel free to come into the Kitchen then,\u2019 he says. \u2018There\u2019s a bunch of homeless Vets that hang out round 53rd and 10th, since no one wants to own the Fisk building that brought him down. Our local VA counselor doesn't give a shit; maybe you\u2019ll do better.\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018I\u2019ll certainly try.\u2019</p>\n<p>That\u2019s how Sam finds himself in Hell\u2019s Kitchen weekly, trying to fix another man\u2019s mistakes. Clint\u2019s certain he\u2019s having a ball doing it and one of the local law firms, a Nelson and Murdock, offers free legal advice.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s kinda awesome, honestly.</p>\n<p>********</p>\n<p>Of the entire team, Clint\u2019s sure that Nat would have been the one to push a loophole in Mike\u2019s instructions and enter Hell\u2019s Kitchen. Tony might\u2019ve just bulldozed his way in but everyone\u2019s made it clear if he does so, he faces the consequences alone and Daredevil has enough of a reputation as a brutal and unforgiving vigilante to make even Tony Stark think twice.</p>\n<p>That and Pepper\u2019s on his case, keeping him out of the Kitchen even if she has to make him take a longer route home. Between that, and Mike\u2019s reputation, Clint\u2019s not been worried Tony might ignore Mike\u2019s wishes.</p>\n<p>But Nat. Nat. Nat\u2019s entire life is living in loopholes and manipulations. If she\u2019d decided to enter Hell\u2019s Kitchen, Clint has no doubt she would have found the justification for her actions.</p>\n<p>Thankfully she\u2019s seemingly decided on a different path.</p>\n<p>\u2018Have you noticed our little spider problem?\u2019 Mike asks, breaking a long silence. Well, speaking silence as beside Clint, Thor\u2019s thunderous snores are their own rock concert. Clint\u2019s not sure how he\u2019s going to get Thor home; the God ate an unholy amount of pizza just to prove he could - much to Mike\u2019s amusement - and drifted off to sleep minutes later, using Clint\u2019s jacket as a pillow.</p>\n<p>But that\u2019s not what Mike\u2019s commenting on. \u2018I might have, yes. Bit of a deadly one.\u2019</p>\n<p>Mike\u2019s lips quirk in his usual half smile. \u2018At least it seems Hell\u2019s Kitchen is spider free. The problem hasn\u2019t crossed the border.\u2019 He tilts his head south, to where Clint can\u2019t see Nat but is one hundred percent convinced she is. \u2018The borders might be having some issues but technically not the city.\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018A technically good enough for you?\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018I get the feeling that\u2019s more than anyone else would get.\u2019</p>\n<p>Clint smirks at Mike\u2019s astute observation and nods. \u2018She\u2019s not normally one to be told not to do something, if she wants to do it.\u2019</p>\n<p>Mike just hums in agreement before leaning over Clint to poke at Thor. \u2018He\u2019s definitely out,\u2019 he says with a smile.</p>\n<p>\u2018Oh yeah. I\u2019m going to have to carry him home, just watch.\u2019</p>\n<p>The smile on Mike\u2019s face is now a grin, but not the dangerous one Clint often sees. This one makes him look young and dorky, despite the intimidating horns. \u2018That\u2019ll be a sight to see.\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018What, me being crushed? Great sight I\u2019m sure.\u2019</p>\n<p>Laughing outright now, Mike nods towards Nat. \u2019Why not ask for help?\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018You\u2019d allow that?\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018Might as well.\u2019</p>\n<p>Nat\u2019s at their side minutes after Clint calls, her steps across the roof clipped and slow. She\u2019s <em> nervous </em> , Clint realises, though he doubts Mike has the skill to tell - even Clint\u2019s struggling to notice it and he <em> knows </em> Nat as no one else alive does.</p>\n<p>\u2018Hey boys,\u2019 she says in a light voice. \u2018Heard you needed someone big and strong to move something around.\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018Do you understand why I\u2019m angry with you?\u2019 Mike asks, his voice dropping into the deep register he uses while fighting. Clint\u2019s not heard it directed at him in months.</p>\n<p>\u2018Yes,\u2019 Nat says, her voice losing every drop of its lightness. \u2018I treated you like the woman I manipulate men into thinking me to be. I underestimated you, and that\u2019s my mistake. I shouldn\u2019t have assumed I knew\u2026 that I was best.\u2019</p>\n<p>Mike just stares at her, until she shifts minutely. It\u2019s a movement so small Clint only just catches it but Mike\u2019s shoulders relax. \u2018That was nearly a genuine, one hundred percent apology. How much do you usually give and mean?\u2019 There\u2019s a hint of amusement in Mike\u2019s voice that has Clint relaxing.</p>\n<p>\u2018Nothing.\u2019</p>\n<p>With a hum, Mike turns his back and walks away. \u2018Get Thor home,\u2019 he calls over his shoulder. \u2018I don\u2019t trust you Miss Widow, but I\u2019m not going to stop you entering my city.\u2019 He lands his jump, perfect as always, then calls over his shoulder, \u2018You\u2019re not completely awful.\u2019</p>\n<p>Nat turns to him, a single raised eyebrow conveying her surprise. \u2018That\u2019s quite a compliment,\u2019 Clint says. \u2018He\u2019s not normally so forward.\u2019</p>\n<p>Laughing, Nat hauls Thor to his feet and gets one of his arms over her shoulders. Clint takes the other side and together they start to drag the still snoring man to the fire escape.</p>\n<p>\u2018I hope you brought a car.\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018If we don\u2019t somehow wake him getting down from here, I\u2019ll pay for the taxi.\u2019</p>\n<p>********</p>\n<p>Nat pays for the taxi.</p>\n<p>********</p>\n<p>\u2018I don\u2019t get you,\u2019 Clint says, wrapping the last bandage around the wound on Mike\u2019s arm; a lucky strike from a mugger. Clint had matched the injury on the attacker, before putting a second arrow in his side.</p>\n<p>He\u2019ll live but it\u2019ll hurt.</p>\n<p>They\u2019re on their usual roof now, with a box of first aid supplies Mike ducked into the building to \u2018borrow\u2019. Clint\u2019s fairly sure this is Mike\u2019s building but he\u2019s not going to press.</p>\n<p>\u2018What do you mean?\u2019 Mike hisses, biting his lips against the pain.</p>\n<p>Clint finishes his work, grateful it wasn\u2019t bad enough to need stitches. \u2018You\u2019re a Catholic-\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018I\u2019ve said before-\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018No,\u2019 Clint cuts in, \u2018not the vigilante stuff. That\u2019s a contradiction I\u2019ve figured is just you.\u2019</p>\n<p>Mike smiles, shifting his arm and pulling on the hoodie he\u2019d also \u2018borrowed\u2019 from inside. The top part of his suit rests beside him and Clint grabs a wet wipe to try and get some of the blood off it before it stains. \u2018You don\u2019t know the half of it,\u2019 he says with a smirk. \u2018Oh, don\u2019t bother. You\u2019re missing half of it.\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018The fact you can tell that while not looking should be more disturbing than it is.\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018I know you.\u2019 Mike shifts the suit, so it\u2019s on the ground before swinging his legs around to dangle over the edge of the roof. \u2018What did you mean then?\u2019</p>\n<p>Oh yeah. Clint closes up the first aid box and takes a seat beside Mike. It\u2019s not early enough for the sun to be rising but it\u2019s late enough for the night\u2019s darkness to be fading. \u2018You\u2019ve never said you forgive us.\u2019 Mike tenses, a motion he feels more than sees and Clint adds, \u2018We don\u2019t deserve your forgiveness and you have no obligation to do so. It\u2019s just, I thought Catholics had to or something.\u2019 He shifts and sighs. \u2018My grip on religion is shaky at best.\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018I did get that. Heathen,\u2019 Mike jokes and Clint huffs a soft laugh. Then it\u2019s Mike\u2019s turn to sigh. \u2018I should have. Forgiven you all. If I was a good Catholic but then\u2026 I\u2019m not really.\u2019 Clint goes to protest and Mike holds up a hand. \u2018No, please don\u2019t. I\u2019m not\u2026 but that\u2019s the point almost? No one deserves forgiveness, not on this Earth. But God gives it to us anyway, because he loves us and we\u2019re supposed to follow his example.\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018But we fucked up so bad-\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018\u201cAnd forgive us our trepasses as we forgive those who trespass against us,\u201d\u2019 Mike quotes and Clint frowns as he tries to place it. \u2018Lord\u2019s prayer,\u2019 Mike adds, reading Clint\u2019s confusion\u2026 somehow.</p>\n<p>\u2018Yeah, that.\u2019</p>\n<p>Mike laughs, a soft sound that Clint\u2019s not sure he actually hears. \u2018I think I\u2019ve mostly forgiven you, well \u2018you\u2019 as the collective Avengers,\u2019 he says. \u2018I just don\u2019t trust most of you.\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018That\u2019s fair. I wouldn\u2019t trust us either.\u2019 Clint takes a deep breath then adds, \u2018If you\u2019re ever free Thursdays-\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018Movie nights?\u2019</p>\n<p>Surprise floods Clint at the words. They keep their movie nights a secret, so no one can take advantage of the information that they\u2019ll all be in one spot on a schedule. \u2018Yeah. How\u2019d you know?\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018Stark mentioned it. Before\u2026 before giving me a tablet I can\u2019t use to fix a problem I don\u2019t have.\u2019</p>\n<p>Making a face at Mike\u2019s tone Clint says, \u2018Right. Well, if you ever want to come, you\u2019re welcome.\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018Stark\u2019ll be there.\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018I know,\u2019 Clint says with a sigh. \u2018And I get that you don\u2019t like him. You have every right to, he\u2019s been awful and ableist and a jerk - which honestly sums up the worst of Tony - but\u2026 movie nights are for the team. And you\u2019re one of us Mike, or near enough to it.\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018...Matt.\u2019</p>\n<p>Clint blinks. \u2018What?\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018It\u2019s Matt. Not Mike.\u2019</p>\n<p>The name \u2018Matt\u2019 sounds familiar in connection to Daredevil but that\u2019s not what Clint\u2019s focused on. \u2018...Fuck I knew you were lying when you said it wasn't even close to Mike.'</p>\n<p>That gets Mik- <em> Matt </em> to laugh, an open, delighted noise. \u2018Michael's my confirmation name though,\u2019 he adds through his laughter.</p>\n<p>\u2018You fucking <em> liar </em>.\u2019</p>\n<p>Matt pitches forward a bit and Clint grabs him so he doesn\u2019t fall off the roof. \u2018Oh no, I didn\u2019t lie. Bent the truth a bit maybe.\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018If that\u2019s what helps you sleep. You <em> liar </em>.\u2019</p>\n<p>********</p>\n<p>Matt turns up to movie night three weeks later, dressed in his old black clothes but wearing the new mask.</p>\n<p>\u2018Nice choice,\u2019 Clint says as he leads Matt upstairs. \u2018I\u2019m still not sure how you saw out of the last mask.\u2019 Mi\u2026 Matt turns his head slightly and Clint adds, \u2018Which would make watching a movie hard.\u2019 He eyes Matt\u2019s get up. \u2018We\u2019re watching <em> The Princess Bride </em> by the way.\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018Oh?\u2019 Matt says, a laugh in his voice.</p>\n<p>\u2018Oh yeah,\u2019 Clint says, walking into the already full common room. There\u2019s a pair of seats left right in front of the T.V. just for them. \u2018Steve and Thor haven\u2019t seen it and no way are we passing up the chance to watch it with a real Dread Pirate Roberts among us.\u2019</p>\n<p>That gets a full laugh from Matt and Tony, walking into the room startles. \u2018Holy shit, he laughs.\u2019</p>\n<p>Matt cocks an ear in his direction. \u2018Well, you\u2019ve not given me much of a reason to laugh Mr Stark.\u2019 He goes to walk past him but Tony steps in his way.</p>\n<p>\u2018Look, I\u2026 I want to start again. Tony Stark, Iron Man and man who made an ass of you and me.\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018Yes you did Mr Stark,\u2019 Matt says, ignoring the hand Tony\u2019s holding out. He steps around him, taking one of the spare seats.</p>\n<p>Tony shrugs and perches on the arm of Pepper\u2019s chair. \u2018Okay Hornhead. I get it. Call me Tony.\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018Of course Mr Stark,\u2019 Matt says with a touch of his usual humour in his otherwise cold voice. \u2018And I\u2019m sorry miss, you are?\u2019</p>\n<p>Pepper raises an eyebrow at Matt\u2019s failure to recognise her. \u2018Pepper Potts.\u2019</p>\n<p>A genuine smile appears on Matt\u2019s face as Clint sits down beside him. \u2018Mike,\u2019 he says and holds himself still as if\u2026 as if waiting to be corrected.</p>\n<p>Well joke\u2019s on him, Clint\u2019s keeping his name to himself. \u2018So Mike, you ever seen this?\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018Used to watch it as a kid with my Dad,\u2019 Mike says softly, turning his head so Clint alone can see his lips. \u2018Haven\u2019t seen it since then.\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018Well you\u2019re seeing it now,\u2019 Sam says as he turns the T.V. on. \u2018We can\u2019t let Steve exist one more hour without seeing this.\u2019</p>\n<p>That makes Matt grin for some reason, like he\u2019s laughing at a private joke. \u2018Yeah, can\u2019t have that.\u2019</p>\n<p>********</p>\n<p>While he\u2019s not there every movie night, Matt starts to make it to at least one a month. Tony takes care to not talk to him unless talked to - Steve\u2019s many talks on what he did wrong seem to have sunk in - and they\u2019ve almost fallen into something of a truce. A truce that might not be the friendliest - Matt taking a seeming pride in calling Tony \u2018Mr Stark\u2019 no matter how the man protests - but it is a truce.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s six movies in, when Matt drops the bombshell Clint\u2019s sure he\u2019s been hiding.</p>\n<p>\u2018What are we watching this time?\u2019 he asks as he walks into the room, the last to arrive as usual.</p>\n<p>\u2018Some Pixar movie!\u2019 Clint calls from the kitchen, throwing the last of the popcorn he\u2019s cooked into a bowl. \u2018What some?\u2019 He offers as he passes Matt on the way to the couch.</p>\n<p>Matt wrinkles his nose as he follows. \u2018Not if you paid me. Which movie is it?\u2019 he asks Steve, who\u2019s certain to know or at least know who knows.</p>\n<p>\u2018Good Dinosaur?\u2019 Steve asks, turning to Sam. Sam nods and Steve turns back to Matt. \u2018The Good Dinosaur,\u2019 he says with more confidence.</p>\n<p>Clint finishes pass the bowls of popcorn around and drops into the seat beside Matt. \u2018If you\u2019ve seen it no spoilers.\u2019 So far Matt\u2019s somehow seen all the movies they\u2019ve watched, though to be fair as they\u2019re trying to catch Steve and Thor up on pop culture the choices have always been commonly seen movies.</p>\n<p>\u2018No, I\u2019ve not seen it,\u2019 Matt says, that note of amusement back in his voice.</p>\n<p>\u2018That\u2019s a first,\u2019 Tony says as he takes the final seat. \u2018Pixar not your thing?\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018Just a new movie I\u2019ve not had time to see.\u2019 Sam picks up the remote to start the movie but Matt holds up a hand to stop him. \u2018I\u2019ve ah, not seen it yet.\u2019</p>\n<p>Everyone in the room is looking at him now and something is poking at Clint. Wait\u2026 \u2018So?\u2019 Nat asks in a soft voice.</p>\n<p>\u2018Does this have audio description?\u2019 The note of amusement in Matt\u2019s voice is basically a laugh now.</p>\n<p>\u2018Oh,\u2019 someone says, or maybe everyone says, as what Matt\u2019s asking for - what he needs - dawns on them. Though he can see the surprise in the faces of his teammates, Clint\u2019s barely feeling any. Matt being blind makes everything Clint\u2019s noticed make sense and he just feels relief to not have to reach a conclusion based on the evidence he has. He\u2019d probably get it wrong. Again.</p>\n<p>As the knowledge settles, Clint finds himself remembering the figure in red, falling to his knees as an arrow buried in his attacker\u2019s shoulder.</p>\n<p>No, the figure in red dropping to his knees <em> before </em> the arrow hit. How keen must Matt\u2019s hearing be to compensate for his blindness <em> and </em> let him hear an arrow fire when he\u2019s half dead.</p>\n<p>\u2018Blind,\u2019 Tony breathes and Matt tenses. \u2018Blind. I can f- no.\u2019 He cuts himself off before anyone can comment, looking at Matt\u2019s tense body. \u2018Okay. Blind. Cool. You need anything; tell me. Stark industries is at your disposal.'</p>\n<p>Matt <em> beams </em>, there\u2019s no other word for it. \u2018I\u2019ll keep it in mind Tony.\u2019</p>\n<p>A light enters Tony\u2019s eyes and he opens his mouth a couple of times, clearly unable to speak.</p>\n<p>\u2018Oh good work,\u2019 Nat says. \u2018You\u2019ve got him gaping like a fish and completely silent.\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018Didn\u2019t think that was possible,\u2019 Steve adds.</p>\n<p>Tony finds his voice. \u2018Oh screw you two. And you too. I can be silent.\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018No you can\u2019t,\u2019 Bruce says mildly as Sam flicks through the audio options. \u2018J.A.R.V.I.S., any audio description?\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018There will be momentarily,\u2019 J.A.R.V.I.S says, a note in his voice that Clint takes a moment to place. It\u2019s the same note Tony gets when he says \u2018There will be\u2019 but actually means \u2018There will be soon because I\u2019m going to either make it myself or find it for you\u2019. \u2018My apologies Mr Mike, for not having it ready earlier.\u2019</p>\n<p>Matt lowers his head, hiding his smile from the room. \u2018It\u2019s fine Jarvis. Usually Fo- a friend of mine does the description.\u2019</p>\n<p>A mini fight breaks out as Steve, Thor and Tony all declare they can do the commentary. Watching the fight, Clint starts to wonder. Blind and named Matt rings a bell\u2026</p>\n<p>Daredevil\u2019s take of Fisk had involved a law firm, Nelson and Murdock, and Clint remembers the endless articles and media reports on blind Matt Murdock, who\u2019d become a lawyer despite all the odds against him. Become a lawyer good enough to help bring down a crime lord even; look at how awesome he is. Best kind of inspiration porn; the type the media ate up.</p>\n<p>Smiling himself, aware he knows everything he needs to about Matt and isn\u2019t going to say a word, he turns to look at his friend. \u2018Think they\u2019re getting the hang of this?\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018Maybe,\u2019 Matt says with a shrug. \u2018Time will tell.\u2019</p>"
