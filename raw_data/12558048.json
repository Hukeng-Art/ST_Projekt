  "notes": "<p>\n<i>O dearest, dearest boy! My heart<br>For better lore would seldom yearn<br>Could I but teach the hundredth part<br>Of what from thee I learn.</i>\n</p>\n<p>-Anecdote for Fathers, by William Wordsworth</p>\n<p class=\"jump\">(See the end of the work for <a href=\"#children\">other works inspired by this one</a>.)</p>\n<p>\n(See the end of the chapter for <a href=\"#chapter_2_endnotes\">notes</a>.)\n</p>\n<p>I thought I was done with this, but it turns out I couldn't resist letting Matsu give Toshinori the pep talk we all wish we could give him.</p>",
  "text": "<p>Ito Matsu likes the man who lives upstairs. He\u2019s about her age, she thinks. Late middle-aged, though he has the look about him of someone who spent most of his youth very ill. He\u2019s tall, thin, a little worn-looking. His eyes are shadowed by a tired, heavy brow. But he\u2019s kind, and offers to carry her groceries for her even when she fears they might be heavy enough to break his spidery arms.</p>\n<p>Really, most of the time he\u2019s a pretty good neighbor. He has a dog, but it\u2019s very quiet. A service dog, she remembers hearing him say. For anxiety. The two of them never cause any trouble.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s only one problem.</p>\n<p>It starts with a boy. Green hair, mid-twenties. He shows up once a week with a cooler. When Matsu bumps into him in the elevator, he sheepishly explains that it\u2019s full of frozen meals he\u2019s made for Mr. Yagi. Matsu hums a little under her breath, but answers his polite smile with one of her own as she steps off at her floor.</p>\n<p>It makes sense, she supposes, that such a delicate man would be worried over by his children. And really, he ought to eat more. She\u2019d nearly screamed just three days ago when she\u2019d seen him in the hall\u2014he looked almost exactly like a skeleton from a distance.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a girl after that, around the same age, with short hair and bright eyes. She comes in with Mr. Yagi, carrying about ten bags of groceries as though they weigh nothing at all. She\u2019s chatting amicably\u2014more at him than with him\u2014but he smiles as he nods along, his little dog watching him attentively as it trots at his heels. The girl waves at Matsu as the three of them pass her on the sidewalk\u2014with the same hand that\u2019s carrying two cartons of milk and what looks like several large jugs of dish and laundry detergent.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnyway,\u201d she says, returning her attention to Mr. Yagi, \u201cHe started in on this whole speech about the individual versus society...\u201d</p>\n<p>Matsu shakes her head a little, but goes about her business. It\u2019s nice, she thinks, that Mr. Yagi\u2019s children look after him so well. Her own son barely comes by on the holidays.</p>\n<p>The third one Matsu only notices because of Mr. Yagi\u2019s dog. He\u2019s walking it in the little green space next to the parking lot, waiting patiently as it makes tentative explorations of the few tree trunks within range, adjusting his glasses and stretching a little. Stretching a lot. He\u2019s very tall, she notes, and thinks as he nods politely at her that he must be another of Mr. Yagi\u2019s brood.</p>\n<p>After that, everything seems to snowball.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a girl with a wide mouth and long fingers who offers Matsu one of the boxes of seaweed tea she\u2019s bringing to Mr. Yagi. \u201cIt\u2019s good for your circulation,\u201d she explains, and then\u2014inexplicably\u2014adds, \u201cRibbit!\u201d</p>\n<p>She almost jumps out of her skin one day when she opens her door at a knock only to find that\u2014instead of the Amazon delivery she\u2019d been expecting\u2014there\u2019s a somber boy with two-toned hair standing on her doorstep. He falters when he sees her, a bag from what Matsu recognizes as a very high-end therapy product brand looped over his wrist.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he says woodenly. \u201cI\u2019m looking for Mr. Yagi\u2019s apartment.\u201d</p>\n<p>Matsu blinks owlishly at him, then gestures upward. \u201cSame room,\u201d she explains, \u201cNext floor.\u201d Then, \u201cOh! And could you take him back this umbrella? He loaned it to me a few days ago, I\u2019ve been meaning to take it up.\u201d</p>\n<p>The boy accepts the umbrella with a brief nod, thanks her, and excuses himself.</p>\n<p>Five, she thinks. A large family, but not unheard of.</p>\n<p>Then there\u2019s one with strange teeth and a reckless grin dragging a new sofa up the stairwell, a well-dressed and fine-figured girl pacing the front walk and speaking rapid-fire into a cell phone about Mr. Yagi\u2019s living arrangements. Matsu gets a static shock off of a blonde, who apologizes with a broad grin as a set of\u2014to all appearances\u2014empty clothes chides him fondly.</p>\n<p>Matsu comes to Mr. Yagi\u2019s door hoping for his help changing a light bulb\u2014he\u2019s much taller than she is\u2014only to be assisted by a bird-headed boy who speaks softly but casts a rather\u2026 odd shadow.</p>\n<p>And really, Matsu thinks, bewildered, that is altogether too many children. And clearly, with their range of quirks and appearances, not a shared mother between them. It\u2019s all very suspect, but again and always, none of her business.</p>\n<p>It isn\u2019t until some time later that things come to a head. There\u2019s some kind of heated conversation going on upstairs. Matsu\u2014who of course isn\u2019t eavesdropping\u2014can\u2019t quite make out what is being said, but it sounds like an almighty row. She hears something break, and decides that\u2014her business or not\u2014it\u2019s time to get involved. She can hardly expect Mr. Yagi to stand up for himself, after all, when the man can barely climb the stairs without getting dizzy.</p>\n<p>She marches up to his apartment and raps smartly on the door, ready to give whichever child is mouthing off a piece of her mind, when the door itself is blasted off its hinges. She teleports smartly out of the way, steadying herself on the wall as she stares at the charred mess that had once been a rather nice welcome mat with little flowers on it (the short-haired girl\u2019s handiwork, she suspects).</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a blonde boy standing in the doorway, one hand extended as though to turn the knob that is now on the other side of the corridor. He closes his eyes. Matsu thinks she can see him mouthing numbers, slowly, from one to ten.</p>\n<p>When he opens his eyes, he turns around to face the interior of the apartment again.</p>\n<p>\u201cSorry,\u201d he says, his voice low. \u201cI\u2019ll replace that.\u201d</p>\n<p>Then he\u2019s off like a shot, brushing past Matsu with a muttered apology and disappearing into the elevator.</p>\n<p>Matsu pushes away from the wall, staring at the closing elevator doors in befuddled shock.</p>\n<p>\u201cMrs. Ito?\u201d</p>\n<p>When she turns around, Mr. Yagi is standing in the doorway. He looks slightly abashed, one hand rubbing at the back of his neck. \u201cI\u2019m sorry if we disturbed you. Young Katsuki is facing something of a rough patch at work, and he gets a bit heated when he goes on a rant. Are you hurt?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAh\u2014 no. Thank you, no.\u201d Matsu dusts off her sweater.</p>\n<p>Mr. Yagi gives her a light pat on the shoulder. \u201cGood! Excuse me, but I really ought to tell the building manager what\u2019s happened. Nasty surprise otherwise, hm?\u201d He walks past her, moving off in the direction Katsuki had gone.</p>\n<p>And she just can\u2019t hold it in any longer.</p>\n<p>\u201cMr. Yagi,\u201d she says, unable to contain her burning curiosity. \u201cI have to ask. How many children do you have?\u201d</p>\n<p>He pauses mid-step, glancing over his shoulder with confusion written clearly across his features.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d he says, brow wrinkling. \u201cAh. None, I\u2019m afraid.\u201d</p>\n<p>Then he\u2019s gone, and Matsu is left with one question answered and a hundred more clamoring to be asked.</p>\n<p>The mystery deepens when a friend of hers\u2014Chiba Seiko\u2014accompanies her out to lunch one day. They\u2019re on their way back to Matsu\u2019s apartment for a little dessert\u2014Matsu has a bottle of good sturdy brandy she\u2019s been saving for a rainy day\u2014when they nearly trip over the green-haired boy as he steps out the front door of the complex.</p>\n<p>Matsu is fairly certain his name is Izuku. He\u2019s around more often than the others, sometimes with coolers and other times with arms full of DVDs. She secretly thinks he might be Mr. Yagi\u2019s favorite, though she\u2019s never said anything.</p>\n<p>He bows a little to them, apologizing for the near-collision. Matsu waves his words away, smiling indulgently. Secretly, Izuku is her favorite too. He holds the door open for them, then bows again and disappears down the walk.</p>\n<p>Turning back to Seiko, she\u2019s about to make a remark when she notices that her friend hasn\u2019t stopped staring at the door Izuku had just exited.</p>\n<p>\u201c...Seiko?\u201d</p>\n<p>She jumps, then turns wide eyes on Matsu. \u201cYou didn\u2019t tell me,\u201d she says, a little breathless, \u201cThat Deku lived in your building!\u201d</p>\n<p>Matsu blinks. \u201cI\u2026 don\u2019t think that\u2019s his name. And he doesn\u2019t live here, Mr. Yagi does. He just visits.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course it\u2019s not his name,\u201d Seiko says, rolling her eyes so hard they\u2019re at risk of falling out. \u201cIt\u2019s his code name! Don\u2019t you watch the news?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt depresses me,\u201d Matsu says with a sniff. \u201cAll those crimes.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMatsu,\u201d Seiko says, grabbing her shoulders and almost shaking her. \u201cMatsu, that was Deku. That was the most famous superhero in Japan! Even you have to know that!\u201d</p>\n<p>For a moment, Matsu doesn\u2019t say anything. She\u2019s cataloging experiences, going over mental notes, remembering the bits and pieces of news she hasn\u2019t been able to avoid.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d she says, when she\u2019s done. \u201cOh dear. I think we might need to look something up.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat one, too.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMatsu you can\u2019t be serious. That\u2019s Ingenium. He runs a massive agency, he wouldn\u2019t have time to visit some old man.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI saw him bagging poop for Mr. Yagi\u2019s dog. It was definitely him. And that one, with the goggles.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFroppy? She\u2019s single-handedly eliminated seafaring smugglers. She\u2019s won like nine medals.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh! The girl with the very adventurous neckline.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCreati is a multi-millionaire.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd the boy with the exciting hair?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cA legacy hero. Matsu, the Prime Minister gave him an award on national television. How can you not have recognized any of these people?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI mind my own business,\u201d Matsu says with a shrug. \u201cWhat about that one, with the nice smile? She\u2019s been around a few times.\u201d</p>\n<p>In the end, Seiko has to stay the night.</p>\n<p>Matsu doesn\u2019t get the chance to speak to Mr. Yagi again until a week later, when they run into each other at the building\u2019s gymnasium. He\u2019s walking on the treadmill, pace even, with a book open on the control panel in front of him. She recognizes it as one that the angry boy\u2014whose code name escapes her, but whose fame Seiko has assured her of\u2014brought by last week, something about inner tranquility and quality of life. The Road to a Happier You, she remembers.</p>\n<p>Stepping onto the treadmill next to his, Matsu starts up a gentle jog cycle. Gone are the days of long, all-out runs, she thinks wistfully. Too hard on the knees.</p>\n<p>\u201cHow\u2019s the book?\u201d she asks, wiggling her fingers at Mr. Yagi in a casual greeting. He looks up, a little surprised, but smiles.</p>\n<p>\u201cA bit heavy-handed, but there\u2019s something to be said for an author\u2019s good intentions I think. How are you, Mrs. Ito?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m all right,\u201d she replies breezily. Then, because slyness is for foxes, she turns to look at him. \u201cDo you mind if I ask you a question, Mr. Yagi?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNot at all,\u201d he says, though she notices the way his fingers tighten on the rails of the machine.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to answer,\u201d she amends hurriedly. \u201cIt\u2019s just. A friend of mine recognized one of your guests a little while ago.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAh.\u201d Mr. Yagi relaxes, his smile going from wooden to genuine in the blink of an eye. \u201cYes, they\u2019re quite well-known in their field.\u201d There\u2019s more than a hint of pride in his voice.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo I\u2019ve been told,\u201d Matsu says, trying to find a way to word her question that doesn\u2019t sound hideously insulting.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re wondering why so many famous young superheroes would darken the door of an old man like me,\u201d Mr. Yagi supplies, his smile still wide and untroubled.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re not that old,\u201d Matsu replies automatically. \u201cIf you\u2019re old, I\u2019m old.\u201d</p>\n<p>He laughs, and it\u2019s a laugh she\u2019s only heard filtering through the ceiling when one of Mr. Yagi\u2019s guests is visiting. It\u2019s too big for him, shaking out of his narrow frame like thunder down a mountainside, and for a moment it\u2019s as though there\u2019s a younger man peering out through Mr. Yagi\u2019s eyes. She can\u2019t help but join in, her own laughter quiet and tinny by comparison.</p>\n<p>\u201cAll right,\u201d he says finally. \u201cLet\u2019s be not-old together then.\u201d</p>\n<p>Matsu nods, and almost forgets her question until he adds, \u201cThey\u2019re my students. Or they were, a long time ago. I think they teach me more than I teach them, these days. Did you know they\u2019re making holo-tablets now? Young Iida was explaining it to me...\u201d</p>\n<p>He tells her all about the latest advancements in technology, all of which seem more like science fiction than science fact. Occasionally his explanations break down into words like \u201cthingy\u201d and \u201cdoohickey\u201d, but he seems delighted by the idea of it. Matsu finds herself swept up by his enthusiasm.</p>\n<p>She thinks Mr. Yagi\u00a0must have been a very good teacher.</p>\n<p>Izuku\u2014Deku, she reminds herself, what an odd code name\u2014is waiting for the elevator a few days later when she comes back from her grocery shopping. He insists on taking some of her bags, though the large cooler resting on one hip prevents him from taking all of them. He smiles apologetically as he adjusts his grip.</p>\n<p>\u201cSometimes I wish I had Shoji\u2019s quirk,\u201d he tells her wryly. \u201cHe\u2019s got six arms.\u201d</p>\n<p>Tentacole, she thinks absently. The Tentacle Hero. Has he visited too? Did she miss him? How many celebrities has she met without knowing it?</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s an awful lot of mittens, come winter.\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku laughs, and he reminds her so much of her own son that she can\u2019t help a smile.</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever seen him in anything but tank tops. I\u2019m not sure he even owns a jacket. Toshi says it\u2019s good to let your biceps breathe, but I think there has to be a limit.\u201d</p>\n<p>At the mention of Mr. Yagi, Matsu\u2019s smile widens. \u201cHe\u2019s awfully lucky, you know. Your teacher.\u201d A soft ding alerts them to the opening of the elevator door, and Izuku waves her in ahead of him before joining her and pressing the button for her floor.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh?\u201d he prompts, adjusting his parcels.</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course.\u201d The ride to Matsu\u2019s floor takes only a moment, and then they\u2019re both trundling down the hall toward her door. She sets down her remaining shopping bags to sift through her purse for her keys. \u201cI think I forgot my teacher\u2019s name three days after I graduated. I certainly never visited him, or brought him meals or anything. I think he would\u2019ve called the police\u2014I was a bit of a problem child.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve met those,\u201d Izuku says absently, waiting as she opens her door and ferries her bags inside. \u201cBut really, it\u2019s the least we can do.\u201d</p>\n<p>Matsu chuckles as she takes the last of the bags from him. \u201cHe must have been quite the teacher, then.\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku laughs. Shakes his head. \u201cWell\u2026 not really.\u201d He taps out a rhythm on the lid of the cooler. \u201cTo be honest, he was kind of terrible. But...\u201d His expression softens a little. His eyes drift up to the ceiling, where Mr. Yagi is probably sitting on his very nice couch with his little dog curled up next to him, sipping seaweed tea and wearing therapeutic slippers.</p>\n<p>When he speaks again, his voice is soft. Thoughtful. \u201cEven if he wasn\u2019t a great teacher. He\u2019s the best man I\u2019ve ever met.\u201d</p>\n<p>He bows then, and starts off down the hall. Matsu watches him until he reaches the elevators.</p>\n<p>Mr. Yagi, she thinks, is an awfully good father for a man with no children.</p>\n<p>Yagi Toshinori lives quietly. He likes it more than he expected, all those years ago when the last of his power left him. Little things mean more to him now; the smell of steeping tea, the sound of rain on his window, the gentle chatter of his neighbors through the walls of his little apartment.</p>\n<p>Well, not that little. Young Yaoyorozu found the apartment and\u2014he suspects\u2014is supplementing his rent. She certainly spends a lot of time talking to the building manager. Once or twice he\u2019s tried to bring it up, but she always waves the subject away.</p>\n<p>Still. It\u2019s warm and spacious, and he has a view of the courtyard. Nana, his little cocker spaniel, has taken to sitting at the window while he reads the paper. Today she watches the first snow of the coming winter as it slowly, surely, buries the leafless trees in what promises to be a thick blanket of delicate white flakes.</p>\n<p>She likes the snow. He should take her for a walk this afternoon, after his tea with--</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a soft rap on the door, and Toshi smiles. Right on time, as always. When he stands up Nana\u2019s eyes flick over to him, but she relaxes when he gives her a scratch behind the ears. Making his way to the door, Toshi flips the lock and opens it without checking the peephole. After all, there\u2019s only one person it could be.</p>\n<p>Sure enough, young Izuku is standing on the other side of the door. Not so young anymore, Toshi reminds himself. He barely has to look down to meet the boy\u2019s eyes these days. And when did that happen? He\u2019s missed it somehow, he blinked at the wrong moment and now Izuku is grown. All of them, grown.</p>\n<p>He shakes the thought from his head as Izuku shakes the snow from the shoulders of his coat. \u201cYoung Izuku,\u201d he greets, because old habits die hard in old men. \u201cCome in, please.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s freezing out there,\u201d Izuku says, giving a dramatic shiver as he steps over the threshold with his oversized cooler. \u201cI think this is the earliest it\u2019s snowed in years!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOn its own, anyway,\u201d Toshi says with raised brow.</p>\n<p>Izuku snorts. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t count. It\u2019s not really snow when Shouto does it, it\u2019s just...\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFrozen water, falling from the sky?\u201d</p>\n<p>The grin Izuku shoots his way makes Toshi\u2019s eyes go soft. He resettles on the couch, Nana trotting over to give Izuku a perfunctory sniff before yawning and taking her habitual place at Toshi\u2019s feet. He watches as his former student bustles around the open kitchen, shuffling meals into the freezer and putting the kettle on for tea. Izuku keeps up a running patter as he works, and Toshi wonders\u2014not for the first time\u2014if circular breathing is somehow involved. Surely otherwise Izuku would have to stop for air.</p>\n<p>\u201c...but she says that\u2019s just me being paranoid. Which, I mean, that\u2019s not completely unrealistic, it wouldn\u2019t be the first time. Still, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a stretch to consider all the possibilities. There\u2019s no guarantee they don\u2019t have contacts in Harajuku, and if they do the whole pipeline could be corrupted. So I told her, either we dig deep or we--\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c--leave the shovels at home,\u201d Toshi recites along with him, smiling crookedly. \u201cYou\u2019d better hope Shouta never finds out you\u2019re stealing his idioms to teach your own interns.\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku just shrugs, pouring the tea into two mugs and flopping down in one of the overstuffed chairs opposite the sofa. \u201cIf he didn\u2019t want me learning them, he shouldn\u2019t have taught them to me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFair. I think he stole most of them from his grandmother, anyway.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPhantom Eye? You\u2019re kidding.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMm. I had trouble believing it myself.\u201d Toshi takes a tentative sip from his mug, but it\u2019s still a bit too hot to drink. \u201cFrom what I hear, she was quite the wise old soul later in life.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019d never know it from her trading card.\u201d Izuku\u2019s phone vibrates, and he checks his coat pocket before going for the front right of his jeans. Not his work phone, then. When he reads the notifications he smiles a bit before tucking the phone away again.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnything urgent?\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku shakes his head. \u201cJust Kacchan. He sent me a photo of one of his flower arrangements. Did you know he\u2019s doing that now?\u201d</p>\n<p>Toshi quirks a brow. \u201cI thought he was gardening. Or\u2026 knitting?\u201d Toshi has a hat to show for the second hobby, with a gap at the side and an odd knobbly bit at the top. It\u2019s lopsided, and too large by half.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s his favorite hat.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh he still does those. Flower arranging is new though. He\u2019s actually pretty good at it, wanna see?\u201d</p>\n<p>Nodding, Toshi leans forward to look at the picture Izuku shows him. It\u2019s a large bouquet, crocuses mostly, with a few winter ferns and a scattering of small white flowers he doesn\u2019t recognize. \u201cIt\u2019s lovely,\u201d he says, and means it.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe says it means...\u201d Izuku takes the phone back and scrolls down. \u201cHappiness and comfort. Huh. He must be having a good day, the last one had petunias in it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Toshi hums agreement, even though he has no idea what that means.</p>\n<p>They pass a pleasant hour, drinking tea and exchanging gossip, until Izuku\u2019s phone\u2014his other phone\u2014gives an impatient trill. He gives Toshi an apologetic look, already standing as he presses the phone to his ear. \u201cMina? You found the pipeline?\u201d He pauses for a brief moment as he bends down to put on his shoes. \u201c\u2026Okay. Yeah, no, that\u2019s good. Is Toru tailing them? She knows their M.O., she--\u201d Izuku struggles with his laces for a moment before giving up on them entirely. He pulls his mouth away from the receiver for a moment to mouth his farewells, but Toshi is already shooing him fondly out the door.</p>\n<p>\u201cGo on,\u201d he chides. \u201cSave the city, or the world, or whatever it is today. I had my turn.\u201d</p>\n<p>Izuku grins, then darts in for a quick hug before bounding off toward the elevator with the phone still pressed firmly to his ear.</p>\n<p>\u201cMina, I have to go. I\u2019m gonna call Tenya, he\u2019s way closer than we are and he\u2019s met these guys once or twice. Yeah-- Yeah, I\u2019ll see you there!\u201d</p>\n<p>The elevator door closes behind him, and Toshi is left smiling at an empty corridor.</p>\n<p>Shaking his head, he slips back into his apartment. He rinses out the cups, puts away the kettle. Then he slips his coat over his shoulders\u2014a coat that fits, all of his clothes fit these days, it\u2019s the strangest feeling\u2014and takes Nana\u2019s leash down from its hook on the wall.</p>\n<p>\u201cCome on girl,\u201d he murmurs as she joins him by the door. \u201cLet\u2019s go say hello to winter.\u201d</p>\n<p>The air is crisp and cool as the two of them step out into the snow. It\u2019s stopped falling for the most part, but a few flakes still sweep in lazy circles before settling on the clean white of the courtyard lawn. Toshi abandons the path immediately, watching with some small satisfaction as his shoes cut through the thick snow beneath them.</p>\n<p>They leave their footprints side-by-side, he and Nana, as they make their slow way through the courtyard and down the little path that leads to the park. There aren\u2019t many people out today, all driven inside by the cold, and Toshi is glad of the thermal gloves Shouto brought him last winter. His circulation isn\u2019t what it used to be.</p>\n<p>In spite of the park\u2019s emptiness, he does recognize one solitary figure sitting on a bench beneath a snow-dappled cherry tree. He waves a little.</p>\n<p>\u201cMrs. Ito,\u201d he greets. \u201cDo you mind if I join you?\u201d</p>\n<p>She glances up at him, a little surprised at first, then smiles and waves him toward the empty seat beside her. \u201cI\u2019d be offended if you didn\u2019t.\u201d</p>\n<p>Chuckling, he eases himself down. \u201cThe cold doesn\u2019t agree with my joints,\u201d he explains, \u201cBut Nana loves the snow.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNana and I have that in common,\u201d Mrs. Ito says, and scratches the little spaniel at the base of her spine. Nana wiggles gratefully, tongue lolling. \u201cI saw Midoriya leaving on my way out,\u201d she adds. \u201cHe looked like he was in a hurry. Nothing serious, I hope?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, probably. But nothing he can\u2019t handle, and that\u2019s the important part.\u201d</p>\n<p>Mrs. Ito nods sagely, and the two of them slip into companionable silence. All around them, snowflakes dip and flurry in the quietest waltz Toshi has ever seen.</p>\n<p>The next time Mrs. Ito speaks, her words are soft and light and completely unexpected.</p>\n<p>\u201cMy parents died twenty-five years ago today.\u201d</p>\n<p>Toshi turns to stare at her, but she\u2019s just gazing off into the middle distance. Watching the lake they can barely see through the trees.</p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t know what to say. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, it\u2019s all right.\u201d She hums, a little distant. \u201cI just always get a little melancholy, you know? Around this time.\u201d</p>\n<p>Nodding slowly, Toshi turns to join her in watching the lake. \u201cWould it be rude of me to ask what happened?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cRuder not to,\u201d she says with a sad little smile. \u201cIt was the Ginza explosion. The one near the overpass, you know. It was on the news I think.\u201d</p>\n<p>Just like that, Toshi feels himself shrink.</p>\n<p>The Ginza explosion. Of course. Of course, the Ginza explosion.</p>\n<p>\u201cI remember,\u201d he says, and his words come out small and worn.</p>\n<p>He does. How could he forget? How could any hero forget his debut?</p>\n<p>Fire everywhere and people screaming, buildings crumbling out from under them. And Yagi Toshinori, barely five years out of UA and shaking in his bright yellow boots. Younger than Izuku, twice as scared.</p>\n<p>He\u2019d carried out armful after armful of survivors, struggling not because of the weight, but because of the smoke. Thick and cloying and hiding who knew how many others, dozens at least, that he knew he was already too late to save.</p>\n<p>Toshi snaps back to himself when Nana butts her head against his palm, worried brown eyes watching him. He swallows thickly.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he manages to croak.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt was a long time ago,\u201d she says, waving her hand as though that can brush away all the pain. All the bitter repercussions of Toshi\u2019s failure. \u201cNothing anyone could have done.\u201d</p>\n<p>And he should nod, should let them slip back into unworried silence, but instead he says, \u201cI could\u2019ve. I\u2019m sorry, I...\u201d</p>\n<p>He can\u2019t finish the sentence.</p>\n<p>She looks at him then. Really looks at him, gaze concerned and then confused and then, finally, comprehending.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d she says softly. And then, \u201cThat makes sense, now that I think about it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry.\u201d It\u2019s all he can say. All he can think, and the world is collapsing in around him like a burning building, and he\u2019s choking on the smoke--</p>\n<p>Then there\u2019s a hand on his arm. It\u2019s small, feminine, covered by a cream-colored mitten. He looks up into Mrs. Ito\u2019s eyes and finds\u2026 he finds\u2026</p>\n<p>Kindness. Understanding. Forgiveness.</p>\n<p>\u201cMr. Yagi,\u201d she says, and her hand on his arm is an anchor. \u201cYou haven\u2019t done anything wrong. Not a thing.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYour parents--\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c--were the victims of a terrible explosion. But you didn\u2019t plant the bomb.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI could have--\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMr. Yagi.\u201d Mrs. Ito closes her eyes. Breathes. Toshi can see tears gathered along her lashes, but she isn\u2019t crying. \u201cAll Might. Listen to me.\u201d</p>\n<p>And he does. Because he owes her that much, at least.</p>\n<p>\u201cListen. You\u2019re upset because\u2026 because you think you\u2019re being measured by the lives you can save, right? And that\u2019s-- Well, I won\u2019t talk about how damaging that is because I\u2019m guessing I wouldn\u2019t be the first person to tell you that. So...\u201d</p>\n<p>She\u2019s quiet for a moment. Then,</p>\n<p>\u201cSo let\u2019s run the numbers.\u201d Mrs. Ito gives him a slightly-watery smile. \u201cI used to be a math teacher. Did I ever tell you that? Not as glamorous as superheroing but I was good at it.\u201d She squeezes his arm. \u201cSo. I think it\u2019s time to talk about exponential growth.\u201d</p>\n<p>Toshi blinks, dazed, completely uncertain of where this is going but clinging to her words like a drowning man. \u201cExponential\u2026 growth?\u201d</p>\n<p>She nods decisively. \u201cHow big was the class you taught, at UA?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAh. About twenty students.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAll right. And I\u2019ve seen most of them around, so clearly you inspired something in them.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t--\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t argue with me, it\u2019s rude and I\u2019m right.\u201d</p>\n<p>Toshi falls silent.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo you inspired twenty children to become heroes. And they each went out and did a lot of really brave things, changed the world for the better. And all the while people are watching them, looking up to them, thinking oh, if I work hard and train hard someday I can be a hero too. So each of your students, they inspire twenty more children to be heroes. And each of those children inspires twenty more, over and over, and do you know where all that started?\u201d</p>\n<p>Toshi doesn\u2019t know if he should answer. Doesn\u2019t know if he can. But then a finger is prodding at his sternum and he looks down to see that she\u2019s taken off her mittens.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou,\u201d Mrs. Ito says softly. \u201cYou are the epicenter of that incredible ripple effect. Hundreds of heroes, hundreds of children hoping-- knowing! That they can grow up to help people the way you do.\u201d</p>\n<p>She sits back on the bench with a puff of vaporous breath. \u201cWe\u2019re teachers, Toshinori. We\u2019re not measured by the lives we save or don\u2019t save. We\u2019re measured by the lives we change for the better.\u201d</p>\n<p>Toshi stares at her for a long, silent moment. Then he turns to stare out at the lake, at the reeds heavy with snow and the overhanging trees he knows will be heavy with blossoms come spring. And for a moment he thinks he can see the cycle of the seasons unwinding in front of him, years flicking by like passing comets.</p>\n<p>He wonders if Izuku will ever sit on a bench like this, when his quirk has been long-since passed on, while a kind stranger passes on this same lesson.</p>\n<p>When he turns to face Mrs. Ito, she looks a little embarrassed. \u201cDid I ramble?\u201d she asks, flushing a bit. \u201cI do that, sometimes. When I don\u2019t know what to say.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNever apologize for rambling. Besides.\u201d He smiles, fragile but sincere. \u201cI think you knew exactly what to say.\u201d</p>\n<p>She shrugs, a little helplessly. \u201cMust be the cold, addling my brain.\u201d Standing, she offers Nana a farewell scratch. \u201cI\u2019ll see you around the building, Toshinori.\u201d</p>\n<p>He nods. \u201cI think I\u2019ll sit a little longer. Walk safe, Matsu.\u201d</p>\n<p>Smiling awkwardly, she gives a little wave and disappears into the gathering dusk.</p>\n<p>Toshinori closes his eyes. Breathes slowly. Allows himself to be still.</p>\n<p>For a moment, brief but real, he can almost feel her on the bench beside him. Can almost hear her cape rustling in the gentle breeze.</p>\n<p>Exponential growth, he thinks. The lives we change for the better.</p>\n<p>When he opens his eyes, the bench is empty. Nana gives a little huff, and Toshi smiles indulgently at her.</p>\n<p>\u201cCold paws?\u201d he asks, and she yips indignantly. \u201cAll right. Let\u2019s go back inside.\u201d</p>\n<p>They move off in the direction of their apartment, following their own footprints all the way home.</p>"
