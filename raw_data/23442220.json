  "summary": "<p>The witchers of Kaer Morhen have never been comfortable with gentle touches. It just isn't who they are. But when Geralt arrives to spend the winter with his brothers looking more relaxed than any of them have felt in years, all due to the affection of a human bard, Lambert and Eskel grow curious. They wonder what it would be like to be touched or held without fear. </p>\n<p>When Lambert runs into Jaskier in a small town in Redania, it's the safest he's felt in years. He and his brothers need touch and kindness more than they're willing to admit, and all Jaskier wants it to <em>help</em> , if only the witchers would let him. </p>\n<p>Geralt and Jaskier are together, all the other relationships are platonic with a good helping of touch-starvation on the side.</p>",

  "text": "<p>Jaskier is being watched. He isn\u2019t sure why, and he isn\u2019t sure by who, but decades spent traveling with Geralt have instilled in him both the ability to tell when someone is watching him and a healthy dose of paranoia. Jaskier has been on the receiving end of some monster\u2019s murderous glare too many times to count. He knows how it feels.</p>\n<p> This, though, feels different. It\u2019s less of a murderous glare and more of a curious eye. He feels it on his back as he struts around town, buying bread with the coin from last night\u2019s performance and winking at every fine lady in town. Which is to say, all of them. Jaskier certainly isn\u2019t picky. </p>\n<p> He thinks the watchful eye might be a fan, or perhaps some woman entranced by his lovely songs. At least, that\u2019s what he hopes. Jaskier hasn\u2019t been this far into Redania in some time, or ever, really, so there aren\u2019t any jilted husbands nearby out for his blood. Besides, he has a good thing going with Geralt. He hasn\u2019t cuckolded any husbands for a few years now. </p>\n<p> The thing is, he doesn\u2019t mind the staring. It\u2019s just that Geralt isn\u2019t with him at the moment. Jaskier\u2019s witcher is off in Kaedwen somewhere, knocking together monster skulls and sulking in corners no doubt, and he isn\u2019t due to meet up with Jaskier for another two weeks. Jaskier isn\u2019t a <em>coward</em>, thank you very much, no sir, not him, but, well, having a big, scary witcher at his back is usually good for warding off things like mysterious stares. </p>\n<p> The feeling goes away when he\u2019s anywhere private, or when he\u2019s performing for the good people of the local inn. Anywhere he might have a decent shot at actually <em>catching</em> whoever is drilling holes in the back of Jaskier\u2019s skull, the staring stops. It\u2019s been a week now, and Jaskier is starting to feel well and truly <em>put out</em> about the whole thing. </p>\n<p> He wears out his welcome at the inn eventually. The coins run dry and the innkeeper throws him out with little ceremony, so Jaskier slings his lute around his back and sets off to the next town, expecting his little \u201cadmirer\u201d to disappear as soon as he leaves. He waits for the prickly feeling on the back of his neck to fade away. </p>\n<p> It doesn\u2019t. </p>\n<p> Muscle memory keeps his fingers strumming at his lute as he walks, but Jaskier\u2019s mind is focused on the weight of watchful eyes that hangs so heavy on his shoulders. He lets it stay there for as long as he can stand, which isn\u2019t all that long. A quick glance behind him shows no one, and the road ahead of him is similarly empty. That leaves only the woods to either side of him. He thinks, very briefly, of wandering into the woods to look for whatever it is that\u2019s following him, but a memory from a week ago stops him short. </p>\n<p> He and Geralt spent the past winter in Kaedwen- Geralt in Kaer Morhen with the other witchers and Jaskier in various towns at the foot of the mountains. When the thaw came, the two of them spent all Jaskier\u2019s hard earned coin on a room at an inn with large beds and made love as much and in as many positions as either man could stand. (And Jaskier can stand <em>a lot.</em>) They parted ways with soft words and promises to see each other soon, before Geralt, in his typical gruff fashion, said, \u201cStay away from monsters, Jaskier. I don\u2019t care how good the story is. I\u2019ll be fucking angry if you die.\u201d</p>\n<p> A romantic for the ages, that one. </p>\n<p> Jaskier, for his part, did not think that the thing watching him so closely would kill him. But Geralt would probably not count \u201cwandering into a dark forest alone\u201d as \u201cstaying away from monsters,\u201d and will likely get angry about it when Jaskier tells him even if Jaskier doesn\u2019t die. So chasing the thing is a no-go. </p>\n<p> Instead, Jaskier simply stops walking. He plucks out a cheery little tune on his lute, stock still in the middle of the road, and whips up a brilliant smile. </p>\n<p> \u201cYou can come out now, oh mysterious watcher,\u201d he calls to the forest around him. \u201cI don\u2019t bite, you know. Unless you are a beautiful maiden, and even then I only bite if you ask nicely.\u201d Jaskier winks towards the trees and wonders idly what vague, disapproving sound Geralt would make at him in that moment for acting like such a fool. </p>\n<p> The forest does not answer him. </p>\n<p> \u201cOh, come on. <em>Please?</em> I\u2019m absolutely up to my ears in curiosity now. You simply must come out and say hello so I can stop wondering so much. Don\u2019t be ashamed about me figuring you out! I\u2019m flattered, really. It\u2019s not every day a bard picks up his own secret admirer, even if you have a rather odd way of showing it.\u201d</p>\n<p> Finally, a low chuckle comes from Jaskier\u2019s left. He whips his head around to stare at the man who steps from behind the trees. </p>\n<p> His steps are silent, even on the ground that\u2019s covered in a thin spring frost. With shoulders and biceps to rival Geralt\u2019s (though not better than Geralt\u2019s, because nobody is that gorgeous), the man looks dangerous. When Jaskier\u2019s eye catches on the silver wolf pendant around his neck, he lets out a suitably dramatic gasp and presses one hand to his chest. \u201cA <em>witcher?</em> My, I am lucky.\u201d</p>\n<p> The man laughs again, louder now, and says, \u201cYou are just as Geralt describes you.\u201d</p>\n<p> Jaskier shoots him a blinding grin. \u201cOf course, dear witcher. My Geralt is a man of few words- he rarely wastes them on falsehoods. Although I would <em>love</em> to hear what he\u2019s been saying about me. Did he tell you how I sing like an angel? That I\u2019m as beautiful as an incubus? His trusty, humble bard that he could never live without?\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cHe said you talk a lot.\u201d</p>\n<p> Jaskier can practically see Geralt saying it- his smile hidden by a mug of ale while he prods Jaskier with little insults that he doesn\u2019t fully mean. The idea of him doing the same with other witchers around sets Jaskier\u2019s head spinning with satisfaction. </p>\n<p> \u201cWell,\u201d he says, collecting himself, \u201cI suppose there\u2019s no accounting for taste. Tell me, when did you last see this oh-so complimentary partner of mine?\u201d</p>\n<p> The witcher steps out onto the road to stand next to Jaskier. Daggers glint on his belt, bright and deadly in the morning sun, but Jaskier is long past fearing witchers and their weapons. They may not all be as lovely as his White Wolf, but they only kill humans who really, really deserve it. The worst thing Jaskier has ever done is wish death upon Valdo Marx that one time, and that didn\u2019t even work. </p>\n<p> \u201cI spent this past winter with him in Kaer Morhen.\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cAh! You\u2019re not Vesemir, I assume. Geralt told me he stays at the castle. You must be\u2026 Lambert, then? Or Eskel?\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cLambert,\u201d the man says, and Jaskier reaches out to shake his hand. Lambert takes it, slow and cautious. It reminds Jaskier, a little unpleasantly, of the first few years he traveled with Geralt when every minor touch or point of contact was an uncertainty. He\u2019s taught his witcher much since then, but washing away decades of touch starvation, loneliness, and mistrust is something they are still working on in their relationship. </p>\n<p> \u201cLovely to meet you, Lambert. Really, quite a pleasure. What brings you to my neck of the woods this morning, my friend? Other than my singing, which, in case Geralt didn\u2019t tell you, is fantastic.\u201d</p>\n<p> Lambert tilts his head and stares into Jaskier\u2019s eyes for a long time. If it is meant to intimidate the bard, it doesn\u2019t work. Jaskier meets the witcher\u2019s look calmly, the smile still tugging at his lips. After a minute, Lambert looks away with a grunt, satisfied with what he found in Jaskier\u2019s gaze. </p>\n<p> \u201cCuriosity,\u201d he answers. \u201cI heard a lot about you this winter, so when I finished up a job nearby and learned you were here I decided to come meet you.\u201d</p>\n<p> Jaskier crushes down his sudden need to know what, exactly Lambert <em>heard a lot about</em> from Geralt, and goes for levity instead. </p>\n<p> \u201cThat was quite verbose, for a witcher,\u201d he jokes. Something warm and happy settles in his gut when Lambert laughs. </p>\n<p> \u201cWe aren\u2019t all like Geralt.\u201d </p>\n<p> \u201cNo,\u201d Jaskier agrees. \u201cI don\u2019t think there is anyone on the Continent quite like Geralt.\u201d </p>\n<p> Lambert eyes him strangely after he says that. Jaskier can\u2019t place the emotion there. Confusion? Constipation? He can read Geralt quite well after so many years, but Lambert is a whole new level of inscrutable.</p>\n<p> The witcher clears his throat. \u201cWhere are you going now?\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cThe next town over. I\u2019ve heard one of the village elders is a master musician, so I\u2019m off to see how well he measures up against Julian Alfred Pankratz, Viscount de Lettenhove, and bard extraordinaire!\u201d Jaskier plays a loud chord to emphasize his seriousness and turns down the road, tilting his body to encourage Lambert to follow him. \u201cAre you heading that way as well?\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cI am. I hear they have a drowner problem, and the nearby Lord has full coffers.\u201d </p>\n<p> Jaskier grins. \u201cFantastic. We can head there together.\u201d He leans over to add a dramatic wink. \u201cI have been told that I am an excellent traveling companion.\u201d</p>\n<p> Lambert falls into step with him, and Jaskier fights the urge to start firing questions at him. He loves Geralt, really he does, but he is <em>dying</em> to learn more about the new witcher who has so easily stepped into his life. Geralt had described Lambert as a brother more than once. As far as Jaskier knows, Lambert, Eskel, and Vesemir are the closest thing Geralt has to a family. Jaskier had wanted to meet them all for years, and now destiny has thrown an opportunity right at his feet. </p>\n<p> There are so many things he wants to know. So much he wants to ask about. But deeply personal questions would take time, and maybe a few mugs of ale, to start asking. Jaskier holds his tongue on that for now, and lets other questions bubble out of him. He is still a bard, after all, and Lambert\u2019s stories of monsters and maidens would make ballads as fine as Geralt\u2019s. Maybe <em>this</em> witcher won\u2019t be as stingy with the details. </p>\n<p> So Jaskier leans in close and asks, \u201cHave you ever seen a chimaera?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u2026</p>\n<p>\n<em>It\u2019s winter in Kaer Morhen, and Lambert is the last to arrive. His brothers welcome him to the ancient halls with open arms and the smiles of people who have not seen each other in far too long. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em> \u201cTook you long enough,\u201d Eskel teases him. \u201cWe nearly drank all the ale without you.\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em> Lambert laughs and aims a punch to his brother\u2019s shoulder that ends in a brief, dirty wrestling match on the floor. He lands a blow on Eskel\u2019s sternum and gets a knee in the gut for his troubles, yet when it ends they\u2019re both grinning like little boys again. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em> Geralt watches from the sidelines. The lines of his body are still hard and tough, but there is a soft smile pulling at the edge of his mouth that wasn\u2019t there a few winters ago. Lambert decides to ask about it later. Until then, he lets his mind ease into the simple pleasures of good food, good ale, and the comfort of company that does not fear him for what he is. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em> It is several weeks before Lambert finds a time to talk to the two of them. To really talk, not just joke and posture like they always do. He\u2019s been paying attention, see, and something about Geralt is\u2026different. Softer. He still wields a sword like every monster\u2019s worst nightmare, but the edges of him aren\u2019t as rough anymore, and Lambert has been cataloguing the differences.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em> Geralt smiles more than before. His hair is pulled into the same half-up, half-down style that he has preferred for years, but it doesn\u2019t look as course or weather beaten as usual. It looks light and well taken care of. His armor, too, is the kind of clean that witchers never bother to make things. Why spend all night cleaning something that\u2019s just going to get doused in blood again the next day? </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em> Lambert can\u2019t make sense of the changes in Geralt. All he knows is that, sometimes, when he\u2019s weak, he looks at his brother\u2019s well-kept hair and wishes he had someone to do that for him. He wishes and longs and aches for gentle fingers on his skin without the smell of fear in his nose. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em> He makes sure Geralt and Eskel are both at least two mugs of ale into the night before bringing up anything personal. There\u2019s a pint warming Lambert\u2019s belly as well- making him just brave enough to let the questions of his mind spill past his lips. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em> \u201cWhen did you turn into such a neat freak, Geralt?\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em> Geralt, ever the stoic type, just shoots Lambert a questioning glare over the rim of his cup. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em> \u201cThe armor?\u201d he presses. \u201cThe hair? Gods above, Geralt, you look almost\u2026 tidy. When did that become important to you?\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em> A grunt, and then, \u201cIt\u2019s not.\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em> Eskel cuts in. \u201cThen why all the\u2026?\u201d he trails off, gesturing at how relaxed Geralt looks. It\u2019s a mocking, taunting contrast to the tension that runs under Lambert\u2019s skin every day. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em> \u201cJaskier,\u201d Geralt says.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em> \u201cJaskier?\u201d Lambert echoes. \u201cThat bard you travel with? What does he have to do with this?\u201d He\u2019s pushing, he knows he\u2019s pushing, but the ache in Lambert\u2019s body won\u2019t allow him to let it go. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em> Geralt just growls in response. \u201cFuck off, Lambert.\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em> It\u2019s the wrong thing to say. Any suspicions Lambert had might have been brushed away with a little explanation, but Geralt is digging in his heels. Two can play at that game. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em> \u201cI mean it. You\u2019re different, Geralt.\u201d Lambert is sure that the longing, the jealousy in his voice must be showing through, but he keeps going anyway. \u201cYou\u2019re more relaxed than I\u2019ve ever seen you, you\u2019re actually smiling instead of just glaring at everyone- you\u2019re walking the Path with a human for fuck\u2019s sake! What changed?\u201d </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em> Geralt slams down his mug and levels a stare at Lambert that could make a feral striga beg for mercy. \u201cI got tired of the pain,\u201d he says, and walks away.</em>\n</p>\n<p>...</p>\n<p>Wrenching his mind out of the past, Lambert focuses on the bard walking beside him. He\u2019s chattering away about some lady or another in a town to the south of them, but Lambert is hardly listening. His attention is held by Jaskier\u2019s smell. It\u2019s happiness, contentment, and relaxation all swept up into one; so different from the human scents Lambert is used to. Never before has he walked beside someone other than another witcher without the acrid burn of fear in his nose.</p>\n<p> Lambert lets the smell wrap around him as he listens to the gentle lilt of Jaskier\u2019s voice. The bard touches his shoulder in excitement once or twice, and it\u2019s all Lambert can do not to lean into the touch and shut his eyes. </p>\n<p> The plan he came up with during those long winter nights in Kaer Morhen is silly, he knows. It\u2019s silly, and pathetic, and desperate, but here, slowly letting himself relax with this gentle, fearless bard at his side, Lambert begins to think it just might work.</p>\n<p>They walk into town late at night. Lambert, unlike Geralt, does not travel with a horse, so it takes the two of them the better part of a day to make it to an inn. By the time they arrive, Jaskier has fallen silent. He\u2019s too tired to muster up his usual chatter, arms too heavy to even strum idly on his lute. </p>\n<p> The witcher next to him is equally silent, though that\u2019s to be expected. What\u2019s unexpected is that, when they go to the innkeeper to get rooms, Lambert only asks for one. </p>\n<p> \u201cAre you alright with sharing?\u201d he asks Jaskier. </p>\n<p> Jaskier can only nod dumbly. Exhaustion drags at his limbs like a fifty-kilogram weight. He\u2019ll worry about paying Lambert back in the morning, when he\u2019s had enough sleep and food to regain control of his own thoughts. </p>\n<p> They kick their boots off at the door. Lambert starts the long process of removing his armor while Jaskier strips down to his smallclothes and flops backward onto the bed, letting out a long groan of satisfaction. He knows from his years with Geralt exactly how long it will take for Lambert to rid himself of all his armor. He knows what it will sound like when Lambert closes the window. Knows how the bed will dip when a large, muscled body drops into it. The movements are familiar to him, even if the witcher with him isn\u2019t. Jaskier lets the comfort of it pull him into sleep.</p>\n<p>\u2026</p>\n<p>Lambert eyes the bard in his bed with something akin to fear tightening in his stomach. Jaskier is everything Geralt said he would be. He talks like a runaway horse, crashing from one topic to the next without a road to guide him. The babble should be annoying, but Lambert finds its constancy soothing. Besides, he has never had an audience more willing to listen to his stories of a life spent on the Path. And if some of them get turned into ballads, well, Lambert was never one to run from a little fame.</p>\n<p> He tells himself that he offered to share the room with Jaskier out of kindness. The bard spent all his coin in the last town, leaving without a cent. Lambert would know; he spent a week following Jaskier around, looking for any sign that he wasn\u2019t as trustworthy as Geralt said he was. But when no such evidence appeared, Lambert was forced to admit that Jaskier was as he seemed: a joyful, welcoming soul. </p>\n<p> So welcoming, in fact, that he has fallen asleep on one side of the bed, a clear space left by his side for another person to slide into. It\u2019s an invitation of sorts, though Lambert won\u2019t make assumptions of someone he just met. No matter how much he wants to. </p>\n<p> He lies down quietly, careful not to disturb the man beside him, and curls his body inwards. Just close enough to feel Jaskier\u2019s heat, but not close enough to touch. The room smells of wood smoke and the musk of a day spent on the road. Not a hint of fear laces the air. Not even discomfort. Lambert holds that sensation in his mind as he drifts off. </p>\n<p> Sunlight through the window wakes him at dawn. He is still firmly on his side of the bed, but there is a hand pressed against his stomach, burning through his nightshirt. Jaskier is asleep. He is reaching out in his sleep. Lambert nearly throws himself out of bed, terrified by the bolt of pure need that hits him like a punch to the gut.</p>\n<p> He thought he was used to it by now. The constant thrum of want in his bones is something that all witchers experience at some point. It\u2019s the consequence of the terror that humans tend to feel around them, and of the lack of intimacy accompanying that fear. Lambert has dealt with this particular want for decades, always pushing it down or satisfying it for a brief time with a visit to the nearest brothel. Now, though, he is allowing himself to hope, to look for touch where it might be freely given, and it <em>hurts</em> so much more than he expected it to. </p>\n<p> Lambert goes downstairs in search of food and, hopefully, a monster to kill. He comes back with both. Jaskier is seated on the edge of the bed, yawning dramatically and smelling of something sweet. Lambert sets a plate of biscuits in front of him. </p>\n<p> Geralt\u2019s advice from Kaer Morhen floats back to him, then, a wiggling reminder in the back of Lambert\u2019s skull. <em>Talk to him,</em> Geralt had said. <em>He likes that.</em></p>\n<p> Lambert was about launch into an explanation of what he learned from the innkeeper downstairs, but something about that feels too businesslike. He wants friendship here, closeness. So instead, he says, \u201cGood morning.\u201d</p>\n<p> The simple greeting is rewarded with a smile bright enough to blind a lesser man. </p>\n<p> \u201cIt <em>is</em> a lovely morning,\u201d Jaskier says. \u201cNothing quite like good company and a soft bed to fix a man up after so long on the road.\u201d He stretches languidly and pulls a biscuit from the plate Lambert brought up. \u201cThank you, darling.\u201d</p>\n<p> Lambert\u2019s head is spinning. That creeping need is back again. It pushes against his skin, insistent and overwhelming. Lambert struggles to get himself back under control.</p>\n<p> \u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d He clears his throat, unsteady, and takes a stab at conversation. \u201cWhat are your plans for the day?\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cPractice, mostly, and a bit of writing. A few of the stories you told me yesterday will make <em>superb</em> ballads, with a little bit of work, so thank you very much for that. I love Geralt dearly, but he is a horrible storyteller.\u201d</p>\n<p> Lambert can hardly imagine Geralt trying to tell a story. Jaskier must speak fluent grunt if he manages to turn Geralt\u2019s particular brand of monosyllables and swear words into the songs Lambert has heard so much about. He realizes, with no small amount of surprise, that he looks forward to hearing them in person. </p>\n<p> \u201cHow about you?\u201d Jaskier asks. </p>\n<p> \u201cI\u2019ll handle the drowners this afternoon. It should be quick. The innkeeper also told me of a few attacks on the eastern road that sound like a griffin. I\u2019ll check that out tomorrow if everything goes as planned tonight.\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cA griffin?\u201d Jaskier\u2019s eyes light up. \u201cI would <em>very much</em> like to accompany you on that investigation, if it wouldn\u2019t be too much of a hassle.\u201d</p>\n<p> Lambert is already shaking his head. \u201cToo dangerous. Griffins are nasty beasts. I don\u2019t want you putting yourself in harm\u2019s way.\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cCome <em>on</em>, Lambert. Honestly. Geralt does the same thing- always trying to keep me out of \u2018harm\u2019s way.\u2019 Can\u2019t a bard have a little adventure now and then?\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cYou hang around with witchers,\u201d Lambert says dryly, \u201cThere\u2019s plenty of adventure to be found without running headlong into danger.\u201d</p>\n<p> Jaskier rolls his eyes and bounces up from the bed. He throws on a bright blue doublet, runs fingers through his hair until it looks handsomely tousled instead of just sleep mussed, and saunters over to where he laid his lute down the night before. \u201cFine,\u201d he says, strumming a few chords, oblivious as Lambert\u2019s gaze latches onto his fingers curling around the strings. \u201cBut I expect to hear all about the drowners when you get back.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u2026</p>\n<p>The absolute worst part about being separated from Geralt is the loneliness. As much as Jaskier would like to have Geralt by his side at all times, the way they live their lives makes that impossible. Sometimes there are monsters that need slaying in towns without anywhere for a bard to perform. Sometimes there are month long musical competitions that bore witchers to death.</p>\n<p> A little bit of separation is necessary for Jaskier and Geralt. Jaskier understands that, truly. But there is nothing he hates more than waking up to an empty bed. </p>\n<p> A strange sense of relief filled him when Lambert only asked for one room. It meant Jaskier wouldn\u2019t have to lie awake like he does on most nights without Geralt by his side, feeling the cold and dark creeping in without anything to stop them. The reassuring presence of another warm body, and a <em>witcher</em> at that, is more comforting than Jaskier wants to admit. </p>\n<p> Lambert is different from Geralt in a hundred different ways, no matter how similar they seem on the surface. For one thing, he\u2019s much more willing to talk. He\u2019s nowhere near Jaskier\u2019s level of loquaciousness, but he speaks in full sentences and makes jokes far more often than his brother. There\u2019s the glow of mirth in Lambert\u2019s eyes more often than not. It makes Jaskier want to lean in closer, to see that amusement catch the light. </p>\n<p> When Lambert leaves to go hunt the drowners, Jaskier finds himself staring at the rumpled sheets he leaves behind. The witcher must have contorted himself in all sorts of strange ways to lie down next to Jaskier all night without touching him once. It reminds him of Geralt when their relationship was new and so many things were still uncertain.</p>\n<p>\u2026</p>\n<p>\n<em>Geralt finishes with a groan and collapses next to Jaskier on the bed. His hair is sweaty and clumped from where Jaskier has spent the last hour tugging at it. He turns to Jaskier with an expression so breathtakingly open that Jaskier has to kiss him. It\u2019s a soft press of lips that seeks nothing more than closeness. Geralt turns from it before it can really begin, just as he always does. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em> The witcher pads away from him on silent feet. He\u2019s grabbing clothes to sleep in, or maybe a cloth to clean them both up. Jaskier doesn\u2019t care. All he wants is to curl up as close to Geralt as he can get and bask in how it feels to touch another person without the haze of sex and urgency between them. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em> \u201cGeralt. Come back to bed.\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em> Golden eyes flash at him in surprise. They don\u2019t talk about this thing between them. They certainly don\u2019t cuddle after sex. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em> \u201cWhy?\u201d he asks, voice a low rumble in the quiet of their room. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em> \u201cLet me hold you,\u201d Jaskier says. It isn\u2019t a question, though Geralt can say no if he wants. It\u2019s an expression of need in no uncertain terms. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em> For a moment, Geralt is the kind of quiet that hurts in Jaskier\u2019s bones. If he has pushed too hard, or asked for too much\u2026</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em> If Jaskier has ruined this delicate moment, he will never forgive himself. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em> Geralt finally moves, stumbling towards the bed as if pulled there by an unseen force. His eyes on Jaskier\u2019s are hungry, aching for more than hands and mouths and filthy words. Unwilling to break the silence that hangs around them, Jaskier holds his arms open. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em> The witcher falls against him, trembling. His quiet moan is muffled as he tucks his head into Jaskier\u2019s shoulder. Jaskier wraps himself around Geralt as tight as he can; hands in long white hair, arms braced on strong shoulders, and legs draped over strong hips. Geralt breaks apart. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em> Jaskier holds him until the sun comes up.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u2026</p>\n<p>Bits and pieces of the story clicked together in Jaskier\u2019s mind as time went by. Little mentions of whores who feared his scars, snippets of conversation from frightened village people, and Geralt\u2019s own hesitancy to reach for Jaskier for anything other than carnal desires all came together to paint one horrible picture. A picture of deprivation and longing.</p>\n<p> He sees the same story unfolding before him now. Lambert leans into touches like he fears them, as if he will show pleasure at something and have it immediately taken away. Jaskier caught some of his desperate glances on the road, but not until he sees the bed sheets does he figure out what they mean. Lambert <em>craves</em> something he thinks he cannot have. </p>\n<p> With a plate of fresh biscuits beside him and the soft morning light falling onto his face like a caress, Jaskier resolves to prove him wrong.</p>\n<p>The drowners take half an hour to wipe out. A couple swipes of his sword, a few muffled curses, and the beasts are dead at his feet, a threat to the nearby town no more. Lambert sits on the side of the river for a while, letting his clothes dry. </p>\n<p> Jaskier is playing in the village square when he returns. There is sunlight in his hair, bouncing off his lute strings. It shines out from his eyes when he smiles. </p>\n<p> \u201cLambert!\u201d Jaskier calls, and Lambert is moving before he can think of a reason not to. </p>\n<p> An impromptu crowd has formed around Jaskier\u2019s feet. He\u2019s sitting on a bench that looks like it was dragged there specifically for him, and people lounge on the stones in front of him, laughing at the words to the song he\u2019s playing. A few of them shy away from Lambert as he approaches. It\u2019s fine. He\u2019s used to that reaction. </p>\n<p> Lambert settles beside the bench and tilts his head back to listen. Jaskier is a full body performer. He dances as he sings, slapping his feet against the cobblestones and swaying his hips. Every word he sings in clearly pronounced with a snap on the consonants to make the lyrics clear, though the tiniest hint of an accent still leaks through, especially on some of the slower folksongs. </p>\n<p> Requests come from the crowd when the final note of each tune comes to a close. Jaskier is straying away from the dirtier songs, ever conscious of the kids playing around them, but he takes any request that\u2019s clean and happy. He plays and grins and by the time a few more songs pass by, enough courage has built in Lambert\u2019s chest for him to speak up. </p>\n<p> \u201cHow about \u2018The Bear and the Maiden Fair\u2019?\u201d</p>\n<p> The crowd falls silent when they hear his voice, and for a moment Lambert is worried that he ruined the magic of it all. Then a woman from the back of the group shouts, \u201cI love that one!\u201d and Jaskier jumps right back into his playing with no more than a wink of acknowledgement thrown in Lambert\u2019s direction. </p>\n<p> They while away an hour in the square- Jaskier in his element and Lambert, surprisingly, less uncomfortable than he usually is with crowds. Perhaps because none of the people\u2019s attention stays on him for long. They\u2019re all too drunk on music and sunshine to fear the witcher in their midst.</p>\n<p> Eventually, the morning melts away and Jaskier reminds them all to stop by the inn that evening if they want more. It\u2019s sure to be a full house. </p>\n<p> With the people gone, Jaskier aims the full force of his attention at Lambert.</p>\n<p> \u201cYou took care of that pretty quick,\u201d he says brightly. \u201cI\u2019m impressed.\u201d</p>\n<p> Maybe it\u2019s the music, or the warmth of the day, but Lambert grows bold. He tosses his hair back and smirks. \u201cI\u2019m just that good.\u201d</p>\n<p> Jaskier snorts at him, but it\u2019s a fond sound. He reaches down to offer his hand, drawing Lambert\u2019s attention to the fact that he\u2019s still stretched out on the ground at Jaskier\u2019s feet. He takes the offered hand with a nod of thanks and Jaskier hauls him to his feet. All Lambert\u2019s muscle is heavy on its own, never mind the armor and weaponry weighing him down. It\u2019s a show of strength that the bard brushes past without noticing the look of pleased surprise that spreads across Lambert\u2019s face. </p>\n<p> Instead of dropping Lambert\u2019s hand as soon as he\u2019s on his feet, Jaskier holds it for a second, then runs his hand up Lambert\u2019s bicep to drape his arm over Lambert\u2019s shoulder. It\u2019s casual, familiar. It sets Lambert\u2019s head spinning. Jaskier guides him by the shoulder with ease, and Lambert follows along on heavy feet, too distracted to focus on where they\u2019re going. </p>\n<p> \u201cCome on, oh great witcher. Slayer of the drowners- protector of the town!\u201d Jaskier squeezes his shoulder and bumps their hips together. \u201cLet me buy you lunch.\u201d</p>\n<p> Jaskier guides them to a bakery that\u2019s bustling with the midday rush. It\u2019s a simple place- the people here don\u2019t have money for much more than sandwiches- but the tables inside look crowded. Lambert knows there will be sounds and smells louder and stronger than he usually prefers. He decides not to let it bother him. Clean, easy kills like this one are too rare, and he won\u2019t let his enhanced senses get in the way of his celebration.</p>\n<p> The woman behind the counter smiles at Jaskier as he flips her a coin. She slides him two hunks of bread, a plate of cured meat, and two mugs of ale. Lambert thinks he sees her blush when they stride out the door again. </p>\n<p> Jaskier plops down on the side of the building facing the square and sets the food down next to him. Lambert stands next to him dumbly until he raises an eyebrow and says, \u201cSit.\u201d</p>\n<p> Lambert sits. \u201cWhy aren\u2019t we eating inside?\u201d</p>\n<p> Jaskier shrugs and sidles over until his leg is pressed against Lambert\u2019s. \u201cToo loud.\u201d</p>\n<p> Lambert is about to ask how, exactly, a small-town bakery is louder than the performances Jaskier is used to, but he doesn\u2019t manage to say anything before Jaskier launches into a long winded story about his time at Oxenfurt. It\u2019s probably better not to ask, anyway. He would rather listen and bask in the warmth of Jaskier\u2019s leg against his own. </p>\n<p> After lunch, Lambert makes his way to the house of the local lord. He\u2019s owed payment for the drowners, simple at they were, and he wants to ask about the rumors of a griffin that the innkeeper mentioned. </p>\n<p> \u201cThat beast!\u201d the lord exclaims when Lambert asks. \u201cBeen terrifying my people for months now, it has. I don\u2019t suppose you could take care of that for me, Master Witcher?\u201d</p>\n<p> Lambert informs him that, yes, of course he can, and yes, it will cost extra. There\u2019s a world of difference between a griffin and a couple of drowners. But the town is desperate, the coffers are full, and they part ways having settled on a contract. Despite neglecting payment for the few days he\u2019ll need to track the thing and plan for the hunt, it\u2019s one of the more generous contracts that Lambert has been offered recently. </p>\n<p> The inn is full that night. Word spread quickly that a bard was in town, and the <em>White Wolf\u2019s</em> bard no less. Lambert was lucky he grabbed a seat before people still flooded in, or he would have missed the show. </p>\n<p> Jaskier plays long and well. He starts light, eventually working his way into the bawdier songs- quick, dirty tunes about beautiful women and their heaving bosoms. More than a few of the ladies in the audience tug flirtatiously at the edge of Jaskier\u2019s doublet as he passes through the crowd. He just sends them a smile and continues the set. </p>\n<p> By the time the night is over, Lambert is well-fed, warm with ale, and too strung out focus on anything besides Jaskier\u2019s hands on his lute and the painful thought of sharing a bed again without being able to close the distance between them. He doesn\u2019t know if it\u2019s relief or some kind of new, exquisite torture when Jaskier finishes his performance, slides over to Lambert\u2019s table, and walks them up the stairs. His hand is firm and hot on Lambert\u2019s shoulder the whole way up.</p>\n<p>\u2026</p>\n<p>The satisfaction of a show gone well settles deep into Jaskier\u2019s bones as he heads to his room with Lambert. It\u2019s the high of his passion for music combined with adoration from the crowd- a heady mix. But he needs his wits about him for tonight. He knows all too well how skittish witchers can get, especially when they are offered something that they feel guilty for wanting so desperately. Jaskier is determined to blow past Lambert\u2019s defenses before he even realizes it\u2019s happened.</p>\n<p> Jaskier closes the door quietly behind him and sets his lute down beside it. Normally, he would be chattering away about the performance, or pestering Lambert with questions about some monster or another. Not tonight. Tonight, he shrugs off his clothes until he\u2019s standing in nothing but his breeches and an undershirt. </p>\n<p> He turns to Lambert, who has just managed to get his boots off, and tugs at one of the straps holding his shoulder piece in place. The witcher freezes at his touch, but does not move away. That\u2019s enough for Jaskier. </p>\n<p> \u201cWhy do you wear this all the time, anyway?\u2019 he asks, knowing Lambert needs something to focus on. Geralt always did, especially the first few times Jaskier helped him undress. There is something remarkably intimate about removing someone else\u2019s armor. </p>\n<p> He\u2019s proven right when Lambert answers him in a voice noticeably rougher than it was the minute before. \u201cIt\u2019s for protection.\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cYes, obviously.\u201d Jaskier finishes with the shoulder pieces and begins working on the various laces and buckles that keep the chest plate in place. \u201cBut why not take it off when you\u2019re done fighting? I think silk is far more comfortable to lounge in than all this leather.\u201d </p>\n<p> \u201cWitchers don\u2019t do much <em>lounging</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p> With the upper body armor removed, Jaskier rests his chin on Lambert\u2019s shoulder and lets the witcher fumble off the heavy padding below his waist. \u201cPity. Lounging is the best activity in the <em>world</em>, darling.\u201d He doesn\u2019t miss the shiver that runs through Lambert at the endearment. \u201cPreferably with lots of wine and naked women.\u201d</p>\n<p> Lambert makes a choked sound, clears his throat, and says, \u201cThought you and Geralt were exclusive?\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cWe are.\u201d He chuckles. \u201cDoesn\u2019t mean I can\u2019t enjoy the view.\u201d</p>\n<p> Jaskier leans back a little, but stays close enough that he knows Lambert can still feel the warmth of his body. He was amazed, so many years ago, to discover how sensitive Geralt\u2019s skin was to temperature. And touch. And\u2026everything else, really. They spent a long, enthusiastic week in bed when Geralt finally worked up enough words to explain that witcher sensitivity extends beyond scent and sound. </p>\n<p> Movements slow and certain, Jaskier pulls his shirt over his head, tosses it lightly to one corner of the room, and heads off the question in Lambert\u2019s eyes before he can ask it. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me you sleep fully clothed all the time? Because that would be a tragedy.\u201d Jaskier tugs lightly on the edge of the undershirt that Lambert is still wearing before scooting back to lay against the pillows at the head of the bed. </p>\n<p> There is a brief moment of hesitation, a mere trembling of fingers, before Lambert pulls his shirt off as well. That won\u2019t do <em>at all</em>. Jaskier needs him relaxed for this. He needs him too focused on the comfort of embrace to let shame rear its ugly head. It would be easier to avoid fully clothed, Jaskier knows, but he also knows that skin-to-skin contact is infinitely more satisfying than having two layers of cloth between them. </p>\n<p> He hopes that Lambert\u2019s own uncertainty and self-flagellation will hold off long enough for Jaskier to get his arms around him. There won\u2019t be any room for thought after that, he\u2019s sure. Not with the way Lambert was watching him all day. Not when Jaskier knows, somewhere deep inside him, that no one has touched Lambert in years without him paying them first. </p>\n<p> Finally, <em>finally</em>, Lambert leans back. He\u2019s drawn up taut as whipcord, but they can fix that. Jaskier blows out the candle on his bedside table, plunging the room into darkness. He ignores the fact that witchers can see quite well in the dark. This is about tone, and he needs to strike just the right chord to have any hope of wiping some of that awful tension out of Lambert\u2019s body. </p>\n<p> It looks painful. </p>\n<p> Jaskier tosses a blanket over them both- too much space between them still. Lambert is facing away from him, his breathing so even and regular that Jaskier knows he\u2019s controlling it on purpose. He thinks briefly about not pushing the issue, but memories flood back of the terror written into every line of Geralt\u2019s body the first few times they got this close. Fear of rejection. Of hatred. Fear that Jaskier would offer him something so beautiful and snatch it away at the last second, laughing at the poor, pathetic witcher in his bed. </p>\n<p> It took Jaskier too long to figure it out the first time. He read Geralt\u2019s fear as reluctance, as rejection, and held himself back from true intimacy for weeks. Now, Jaskier has a better understanding of the ridiculous, twisted thought processes that witchers have when it comes to their own needs. He won\u2019t make the same mistake twice. </p>\n<p> Jaskier rolls over so his chest is inches from Lambert\u2019s back. He reaches out. He closes the distance. </p>\n<p> A broken noise works its way out of Lambert\u2019s throat when Jaskier\u2019s arms wrap around him. The witcher can\u2019t help himself from pressing backward, trying to get as much contact as possible, but part of him screams to pull away before Jaskier can. Before he realizes what the scars on Lambert\u2019s skin mean, before the smell of fear starts leaking off of him like it should, like it always does with humans. </p>\n<p> His breath is coming too fast. Jaskier squeezes tighter and drags his knuckles over Lambert\u2019s stomach, feeling the muscles jump. He lays his palm flat when Lambert sucks in a ragged breath. </p>\n<p> \u201cYou don\u2019t have to,\u201d Lambert whispers, and it\u2019s a tiny, <em>miserable</em> little sentence. Jaskier hates it. He hates every single person who has ever made Lambert feel like he needs to say such a thing. </p>\n<p> \u201cI want to,\u201d he says. And again, \u201cI <em>want</em> to.\u201d Because Geralt didn\u2019t believe him the first time, either. </p>\n<p> \u201cJaskier-\u201c</p>\n<p> He cuts Lambert off with the gentle press of lips to the nape of his neck. That wrenches a groan out of the witcher in his arms, and Jaskier pulls them closer. He makes sure Lambert can feel the ghost of his breath as he says, \u201cI choose this. Of my own free will.\u201d Lambert is shaking freely now, his entire frame shuddering. \u201cI want to hold you tonight, and tomorrow night if you\u2019ll let me.\u201d He drops a kiss to the place where Lambert\u2019s neck meets his shoulder. Pitches his voice low. \u201cWill you let me?\u201d</p>\n<p> Lambert comes alive under his hands. He spins around in the bed, eyes wild, and buries his face in Jaskier\u2019s neck. They\u2019re chest-to-chest now, skin pressed as close as it can get. Lambert\u2019s arms wrap around Jaskier and Jaskier tangles their legs together under the blanket. His own arms are strong and sure where they hold Lambert against him. </p>\n<p> Breath comes out in hot puffs against Jaskier\u2019s throat from where Lambert is losing control. Helpless little sounds fall out of him- muffled whimpers and groans as he tries to hold himself together. Jaskier welcomes it. He slides a hand into Lambert\u2019s long hair and tugs lightly, smiling at the punched out moan he gets in return. </p>\n<p> The noises will quiet, Jaskier knows, as Lambert relaxes. The last of the tension will fall from his shoulders. His breathing will slow and he will tumble over into the kind of sleep that only comes with safety. Minutes or hours, it doesn\u2019t matter. </p>\n<p> Jaskier will hold him until he wakes.</p>\n<p>\n<em>The conversation over dinner haunts Lambert for days. \u2018I got tired of the pain,\u2019 Geralt had said, and those words shot through Lambert like a fucking sword to the chest. Because he was right. It did hurt. It hurt every damn day, and somehow Geralt had found a way out. He\u2019d found Jaskier.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em> Lambert needs to know more. Eskel does too, he\u2019s certain, though they never talk about it directly. The two of them reach an agreement in silent looks and nods as they spar- the language they were raised on. They\u2019re on the same side, no question about that. The only issue now is Geralt. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em> He\u2019ll never offer up information on his own. Getting him drunk might work, but that takes a of liquor, and he\u2019s just as likely to fly into a fit of rage as he is to spill his secrets. No, they need him vulnerable, off balance. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em> It takes a week or so, but their patience is rewarded with the perfect opportunity. Geralt is bathing in Kaer Morhen\u2019s hot spring. Eskel has just come back from hunting their dinner. Lambert is done with the potions he was preparing. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em> \u201cHot spring,\u201d Lambert says as Eskel enters the hall, and that\u2019s all it takes. They head down together. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em> Geralt grunts a greeting when they walk into the cavern with the spring and strip down. This is a common enough occurrence. They wash in silence for a few minutes, enjoying how the hot water melts away the frigid winter air that has seeped into all their bones. Lambert leans against the ledge that Geralt is relaxing on. Eskel quietly positions himself between Geralt and the door.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em> \u201cTell me about this bard of yours,\u201d Lambert says. It\u2019s not subtle, but it doesn\u2019t need to be. Not between the three of them. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em> \u201cHis name is Jaskier,\u201d Geralt corrects. Not very helpful, but definitely more than Lambert was expecting on his first go. Across the spring, Eskel gives him a slow nod of encouragement. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em> \u201cYes, Jaskier. Tell me about him.\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em> Geralt\u2019s stare is guarded, maybe even a little angry. \u201cWhy the fuck do you care?\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em> Lambert shrugs. \u201cIdle curiosity.\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em> \u201cBe curious about something else.\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p><em> \u201cBut I\u2019m curious about</em> this<em>. You\u2019ve traveled with him for years now and you hardly say anything about him. You can hardly blame me for wanting to know more.\u201d </em></p>\n<p>\n<em> Geralt doesn\u2019t bother answering. He pushes out of the water and heads for the door, as if he can escape this conversation. Eskel is faster, planting himself like a mountain in front of the exit. Geralt eyes them both, ire written into the planes of his face. \u201cWhat the fuck is this?\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em> \u201cWe want to talk to you,\u201d Eskel says firmly. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em> \u201cPlease, Geralt,\u201d Lambert murmurs, and he sees surprise in the tightness of Geralt\u2019s stance. He turns slowly, still looking warily between them, and slides back down into the spring. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em> \u201cWhy?\u201d </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em> Eskel swallows down his shame. He meets Lambert\u2019s eyes across the water and is steadied by the steel he finds there. He looks to Geralt. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em> \u201cYou aren\u2019t the only one who\u2019s tired of the pain.\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u2026</p>\n<p>Lambert leaves the griffin\u2019s head neatly wrapped in a sack on the lord\u2019s doorstep and heads back to the inn. It was a long, grizzly fight. There\u2019s a long gash down his right side from where he couldn\u2019t get his sword up fast enough, and a potion still hums in his veins, turning his eyes black and making every villager unlucky enough to see him run away with fear. The sheer amount of blood drenching his armor isn\u2019t helping matters, either.</p>\n<p> He slams open the doors to the inn more forcefully than he meant to, sending a harsh thud throughout the room and causing several patrons to scramble back in shock. Whispers start up as he passes through. None of them are kind. </p>\n<p> Jaskier is upstairs in their room, composing. Lambert hears the soft twang of his lute from a few doors away. The sound calms him, washing away some of the post-kill adrenaline that\u2019s still coursing through him. </p>\n<p> The music stops when he pushes into their room, dripping blood on the floor. Jaskier stumbles off the bed with a gasp of surprise. Lambert waits for the scent of fear to hit his nose, but somehow, miraculously, it doesn\u2019t. All he can smell is Jaskier\u2019s worry and something light and warm like\u2026fondness?</p>\n<p> \u201cOh dear,\u201d Jaskier breathes in that musical way of his. \u201cAre you hurt?\u201d </p>\n<p> \u201cJust a scratch,\u201d Lambert grits out. He\u2019s not very chatty on the best of days, and after a fight it takes a while for his brain to come back to earth. </p>\n<p> \u201cAlright.\u201d There\u2019s the quick shock of touch as Jaskier\u2019s brushes his knuckles over Lambert\u2019s cheek and says, \u201cWait here a moment, I\u2019ll be right back.\u201d Then he\u2019s gone. Lambert doesn\u2019t want to get blood on the bed, so he sits down right where he is and begins to work off his boots. </p>\n<p> True to his word, Jaskier reappears a few minutes later, bringing with him a plate of food and that light, warm smell. </p>\n<p> \u201cI ordered you a bath,\u201d he says as he sets the food down. His hands go quickly to the buckles on Lambert\u2019s armor and he helps pull the blood-stained leather away. \u201cHonestly,\u201d Jaskier murmurs as he works, \u201cis this some sort of witcher code I\u2019m unaware of? That you must all come back covered in as much blood and creature bits as possible?\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cNot a code.\u201d </p>\n<p> Jaskier pauses for a minute to brush back Lambert\u2019s hair and give him a soft smile. \u201cI know, darling. I\u2019m only teasing.\u201d</p>\n<p> A knock comes at the door. Two servant girls bring in a tub and pitchers of heated water. They leave as quickly as they came. </p>\n<p> Lambert is sitting nearly naked on the floor in a pool of griffin blood, eyes black as onyx with two massive swords propped up against the wall. He can\u2019t really blame them. </p>\n<p> Firm hands grasp at his shoulders. \u201cUp,\u201d Jaskier orders. Lambert lifts his heavy body from the wood and goes where Jaskier guides him. He slides into the warm water with a groan, memories resurfacing of another bath, in another time, when his thoughts were just as occupied with Jaskier as they are now, albeit in a very different way. </p>\n<p>\u2026</p>\n<p> <em>\u201dHe travels with me. I kill monsters, he writes songs about it, and I try to keep him from getting his throat ripped out. That\u2019s it.\u201d Geralt grinds out the story like the words burn in his mouth.</em></p>\n<p>\n<em> Eskel shakes his head. \u201cThere\u2019s more to it than that.\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em> \u201cYou said he\u2026helps,\u201d Lambert adds, tone softer than Eskel\u2019s. \u201cHow?\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em> They can see Geralt struggling. The muscles in his hand tense and relax in rapid succession, and they can all smell the frustration rolling off him in waves. But he recognizes the ache behind their questions, and he\u2019s trying. That\u2019s all Lambert can ask for. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em> \u201cJaskier is\u2026\u201d Geralt trails off, searching for the right word. \u201cTouchy,\u201d he says finally. \u201cHe likes to put his hands on me. I like them there.\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em> \u201cYou mean he likes to fuck?\u201d This from Eskel, who clearly cannot read a room. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em> \u201cNo,\u201d Geralt growls, then backtracks. \u201cYes.\u201d He curses and turns his head, unable to meet his brothers\u2019 eyes. \u201cNot just in bed. On the road, too, or when we make camp. He likes to hold my hand.\u201d Geralt\u2019s voice grows defensive, \u201cHe likes to sleep in my bed and braid my fucking hair. Is that what you wanted to hear?\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em> Eskel watches Geralt with an unreadable expression. \u201cHe\u2019s not afraid of you?\u201d he asks bluntly. \u201cOf the fact that you could snap him like a twig?\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em> \u201cNo. Jaskier is shit at staying away from danger.\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em> Eskel nods, though Geralt can tell he doesn\u2019t quite believe it, and Lambert tilts his head back into the water. If he focuses hard enough, the waves almost feel like a caress. Across the pool, Eskel\u2019s mind is occupied by much of the same. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em> \u201cSounds nice,\u201d he says and they lapse into silence, each man alone with his thoughts.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u2026</p>\n<p>It <em>is</em> nice. More than nice. Lambert leans back in the tub, Jaskier\u2019s clever fingers teasing blood and griffin feathers from his hair, and revels in the pure, simple joy of hands on his skin. They\u2019ve slept in the same bed every night for a week, pressed close under the covers. It\u2019s the best week of sleep Lambert has ever had, and it\u2019s enough prolonged exposure that he no longer shatters apart at the brief touches that Jaskier is so prone to.</p>\n<p> Jaskier hums as he rubs away dirt and tension from Lambert\u2019s back, little snippets of slow songs that don\u2019t play as well with common audiences. He seems comfortable with the act of washing a body of blood. Practiced. Lambert wonders how many times the bard has been in this exact position with a certain white-haired witcher. He wonders why Jaskier is so willing to do the same for a man he barely knows. </p>\n<p> \u201cWhy are you doing this?\u201d he asks. It\u2019s barely a sentence, so softly does he say it.</p>\n<p> Jaskier\u2019s hands still in his hair, just for a second. He picks up a pot of soap that smells like nothing at all. Works it into a lather. His answer is a long time coming. </p>\n<p> \u201cWould you deny a man food, if you had it and he did not?\u201d </p>\n<p> Lambert is silent. </p>\n<p> \u201cAll people need touch. All of them. It is cruel of the world to deny you that, to run from you when you risk your life every day to kill the monsters that would destroy it, if given the chance.\u201d He reaches over to grab a pitcher and fills it with water to pour over Lambert\u2019s head, washing away the soap. With that done, Jaskier sinks to his knees and rests his head on the side of the tub. The blue of his eyes is piercing where he meets Lambert\u2019s gaze. </p>\n<p> \u201cDo not think I pity you,\u201d he says firmly, though there\u2019s kindness beneath the words, \u201cBecause I don\u2019t. I\u2019m a selfish man, Lambert. I don\u2019t like traveling alone, and I can\u2019t stand an empty bed. Having you here is as much for my comfort as it is for yours.\u201d Those words loosen the guilt creeping up in Lambert\u2019s throat. They dislodge the whispers that claw at the back of his mind, accusing him of taking advantage of Jaskier\u2019s kindness, of <em>taking</em> anything for himself. </p>\n<p> Jaskier reaches out with one hand to cradle Lambert\u2019s face, thumb sweeping gentle arcs across his cheekbone. \u201cBesides,\u201d he says, \u201cI like helping you clean off. I might not be able to help you fight, but I can do this. I can make sure you have somewhere safe and warm to come back to.\u201d He leans in, a smile crinkling his eyes. \u201cWould you deny me that?\u201d </p>\n<p> Lambert can only shut his eyes, shake his head, and shudder at the kiss Jaskier presses to his temple.</p>\n<p>\u2026</p>\n<p>They part ways the next day. There is no more work for Lambert in town, and Jaskier has promised to meet up with Geralt in a few days time in Kaedwen. Breakfast is a quiet affair, or as quiet as something can be with Jaskier in the room, and they walk to the edge of town together. Jaskier is eastbound, Lambert west.</p>\n<p> Jaskier pulls Lambert into a bone-crushing hug, uncaring that he\u2019s covered in armor and weaponry. Lambert buries his face in Jaskier\u2019s neck and breathes deep. There\u2019s excitement there, for the open road, and a tinge of sadness, but still no fear. Never that. </p>\n<p> When Jaskier pulls back, his hands come up to cradle Lambert\u2019s face. \u201cDon\u2019t make destiny do all the work next time.\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d Lambert asks. The question comes out on a huff of laughter. </p>\n<p> \u201cIt means, my sweet, silly witcher, that you shouldn't leave our next meeting up to chance.\u201d Jaskier\u2019s lips quirk up into a smile. \u201cJust follow the rumors of beautiful music and ladies\u2019 broken hearts- I can\u2019t be that difficult to track.\u201d He runs a tender hand through Lambert\u2019s hair, dry and blessedly free of blood. \u201cI always enjoy company, especially company as fine as yours. Come find me- you\u2019ll be welcome.\u201d</p>\n<p> Lambert\u2019s heart jumps at the invitation, so freely offered. He can tell Jaskier means it. And he has never meant anything more than when he says, \u201cI will.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u2026</p>\n<p>Hundreds of miles away, in a shitty tavern on the southernmost edge of Cintra, a farmer spits at Eskel\u2019s feet. He curses- something about dirty witchers and the beasts they hunt- and everything is suddenly, painfully, <em>too much</em>. Every insult. Every curse. Every whore who looks at him like he\u2019s not worth the coin they got for touching him. It all hits Eskel at once.</p>\n<p> He pushes to his feet. Manages, just barely, not to knock the man\u2019s breath out of his lungs on the way out. He makes it to the stables and collapses against his horse\u2019s flank, fighting to keep his breath steady and his legs firm. </p>\n<p> Eskel is <em>tired</em>. </p>\n<p> After a long minute, Eskel swings himself into the saddle and digs his heels into the horse\u2019s side. They fly out of town, fast as wind over the sea. North, Eskel thinks. They\u2019ll head north. </p>\n<p> It\u2019s time to find Geralt\u2019s bard.</p>\n<p>\n<em>They have to let Geralt leave the hot spring eventually, of course, and if they\u2019re being honest, Eskel and Lambert are too preoccupied with the ache under their skins to worry about grilling him any further. Lambert leaves shortly after Geralt, but Eskel stays, soaking and thinking. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em> Geralt surprises everyone, perhaps none more so than himself, when he brings it up again a few nights later. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em> \u201cHe\u2019d like to meet you,\u201d Geralt says, and falls abruptly silent again. He doesn\u2019t know what the hell he\u2019s doing. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em> Vesemir is away from the hall tending to matters in another part of the keep, leaving only Eskel and Lambert to hear the quiet words. They don\u2019t have to ask who Geralt is talking about. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em> \u201cHe would?\u201d Lambert asks cautiously.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em> Geralt grunts noncommittally. He makes the mistake of looking up from the sword he\u2019s sharpening, only to be speared by two sets of hungry, piercing eyes. He knows that look all too well. It hurts to see, and he decides that maybe, just maybe, a little more effort is called for in this conversation. \u201cHe asks after you, sometimes. About what you\u2019re like. How we grew up together.\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em> A fond smile teases at Lambert\u2019s lips, and Eskel\u2019s eyes light up with mischief. \u201cOh, the stories I could tell your bard, Geralt,\u201d he teases. \u201cDo you remember that summer when you-\u201c</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em> \u201cShut up,\u201d Geralt growls. They know he doesn\u2019t mean it. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em> The only sound is the crackle of logs in the fireplace and the low rasp of metal as it\u2019s dragged over a whetstone. Lambert breaks the quiet. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em> \u201cI\u2019d like to meet him,\u201d he says. Eskel nods his assent. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em> There is a choice to be made. Geralt can let the issue drop, can let it be just one more meaningless conversation amongst decades of the same, and it will never be brought up again. His brothers will walk the Path once more, alone like he used to be, never crossing paths with the bard who has brought Geralt so much joy. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em> Or, he can say something. Can push the conversation from speculation to certainty, from idle chatter into a solid, spoken offer. It would be so, so easy to say nothing. But he remembers long days on the Path, cold nights, the disdain in human eyes as he passes through their towns. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em> Geralt chooses to speak. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em> \u201cWe don\u2019t travel together all the time,\u201d he says, gaze fixed firmly on the edge of his blade. \u201cSome weeks he needs to go one way and I another.\u201d Geralt pulls in a deep breath, the weight of his brothers\u2019 eyes on his chest like an extra plate of armor. \u201cI do not think he would be averse to\u2026company.\u201d </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em> He does not need to say the other thing hanging in the back of his mind. That he would like to know Jaskier does not have to travel alone- that one of his brothers may be willing to watch his back when Geralt cannot. There are so many monsters in the world, and Geralt is only one man. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em> Lambert\u2019s pulse is pounding loud enough for Geralt to hear across the room. Eskel\u2019s is as well, though he\u2019s better at controlling it. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em> \u201cDo you think he would\u2026?\u201d Lambert trails off, uncertain. Words hang between them, unspoken but still echoing to the deepest reaches of Kaer Morhen\u2019s cavernous ceilings. After all their years together, Geralt can read the silence well.</em>\n</p>\n<p> Do you think he would welcome us, as he did you? Would he hold us close, not as lovers, but as friends? Can one bard\u2019s heart be big enough for that?</p>\n<p> <em>\u201dYes.\u201d</em></p>\n<p>\n<em> It\u2019s a simple answer, an honest answer. It washes over Geralt\u2019s brothers like a balm. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em> He gives them a minute to process before adding, \u201cBut if you put one single finger where he doesn\u2019t want it, I\u2019ll rip your cocks out through your throats.\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u2026</p>\n<p>Jaskier doesn\u2019t even flinch when a body presses against his back and two large hands settle on his hips. He knows that body. He trusts those hands.</p>\n<p> \u201cHello, love,\u201d he says brightly. Jaskier leans back into the hold, lute held loose in his arms, and tips his head so he can see Geralt\u2019s eyes. \u201cHow was Kaedwen?\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cBoring,\u201d comes the answering rumble. Hands come up to pull Jaskier\u2019s fingers from his instrument. \u201cPut that down.\u201d</p>\n<p> Jaskier grins. He places the lute down gently against a wall- he was standing outside the stables of yet another inn, waiting for Geralt- and turns into his lover\u2019s embrace. A yelp of surprise is knocked out of him when Geralt picks him up to press him against the wall behind them, Jaskier\u2019s legs fitting neatly around his waist, lithe body held with little effort by the arms around him. </p>\n<p> \u201cNot enough challenge in monster killing anymore?\u201d he teases. Jaskier reaches out to tuck a curl of white hair behind Geralt\u2019s ear. It\u2019s cleaner than he expected, after so long apart. Geralt must have taken a dunk in a stream before coming to town. </p>\n<p> \u201cMissed you,\u201d is all he says, and Jaskier <em>melts.</em></p>\n<p> Jaskier wants to say something sappy back, but they are quickly nearing the limit of how much sweetness Geralt can take at once. He deals with action much better than words. So Jaskier tightens his legs around Geralt\u2019s hips and leans down to steal a kiss. \u201cMissed you too, darling.\u201d He nips at Geralt\u2019s ear. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you take me upstairs and I\u2019ll show you just how much?\u201d</p>\n<p> Geralt puts him down with an eager noise and Jaskier leads him upstairs, laughing all the way.</p>\n<p>\u2026</p>\n<p>They lie in bed together, a tangle of limbs. Geralt breathes deep, soaking in the smells of pleasure and happiness wafting from Jaskier\u2019s skin. Like spiced apples and honey wine. Like the first ray of sun through the remnants of a thunderstorm.</p>\n<p> Jaskier\u2019s fingers tangle in his hair. Later, when he doesn\u2019t feel quite so vulnerable, Geralt will ask him to braid it. For now, all he wants is to enjoy the press of skin on skin, the warmth of Jaskier\u2019s breath in the hollow of his throat. He loves these silent moments, though the \u201csilent\u201d bit never lasts long. </p>\n<p> \u201cI ran into your brother,\u201d Jaskier says. </p>\n<p> His voice breaks the quiet, but it does not break the moment. Geralt is too warm and content to think much, and far too satisfied for real worry. \u201cWhich one?\u201d he mumbles.</p>\n<p> The smell of honey wine spikes in his nose as Jaskier tugs lightly at the hair in his hand, scratching at Geralt\u2019s scalp the way he likes so much. \u201cLambert. He\u2019s a real sweetheart, you know. Not that he\u2019d be happy to hear me say it out loud, mind, but he is. We traveled together for a few days, and I got some great song material out of it. He\u2019s a fabulous story-teller, unlike <em>some</em> people I know.\u201d </p>\n<p> Geralt hums. \u201cYou love me,\u201d he says, just to feel the shiver that ripples down Jaskier\u2019s spine upon hearing it. \u201cEven if my stories suck.\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cWell, yes,\u201d Jaskier says, his voice breathy and pleased. \u201cObviously. But it was nice to meet another witcher, especially one you\u2019re close with. I can see why you trust him so much.\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cI\u2019m glad he found you,\u201d Geralt says, only half aware of his own words. </p>\n<p> Jaskier\u2019s hand stills in his hair. \u201cFound me?\u201d</p>\n<p> Shit. Geralt tenses up on instinct and tries to relax a second later, because Jaskier will notice, damn him. He always notices. He always notices, he always finds the thing Geralt doesn\u2019t want to talk about, and he always makes them talk about it anyway. </p>\n<p> \u201cGeralt,\u201d Jaskier starts, \u201cWhat do you mean he \u2018found me\u2019?\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cTold him you\u2019d be in Redania a while. If he wanted to meet you.\u201d</p>\n<p> That should be enough. It would be, for anyone but Jaskier. But Geralt can hear the gears grinding in his thoughts, can practically smell the pieces falling into place. He crushes down the panic that forms in his chest. </p>\n<p> Jaskier stares at the edge of the bed they\u2019re curled up on, brows pinched in concentration. \u201cLambert was\u2026lonely,\u201d he says slowly. \u201cAnd <em>you</em> told him to come <em>find me</em> in Redania.\u201d </p>\n<p> All of the warmth floods out of Geralt\u2019s body, leaving him bereft and shivering. He\u2019s suddenly, painfully afraid that this is it. This is the stupid, unthinking, emotionally idiotic thing that will drive Jaskier from his side forever. </p>\n<p> \u201cJaskier-\u201c he starts, but the bard\u2019s voice cuts over his own. </p>\n<p> \u201cYou told your brothers to come find me if- what, if they needed a hug?\u201d</p>\n<p> The world is spinning out of control. Geralt feels like the bed is falling away underneath him. The only thing that tethers him to the ground is that honey wine, sunshine smell that has yet to disappear. But it will, he\u2019s sure. It will disappear, and it will take Jaskier with it. </p>\n<p> \u201cJaskier, I\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t mean to-\u201c A growl of frustration works its way out of Geralt\u2019s throat. \u201cI would never take advantage-\u201c</p>\n<p> Those words snap something in Jaskier. He stops staring into the distance, focusing instead on the man in his arms. Horror sweeps across his face. </p>\n<p> \u201cOh, darling,\u201d he says with a gasp. \u201cNo-no-no-no-no. You did <em>not</em> take advantage of me. I\u2019m just overcome, overwhelmed really, that\u2019s so-\u201c Jaskier pauses to haul in a breath. He presses their lips together in a tender kiss, the smell of honey and apples so strong Geralt could drown in it. \u201cGeralt, that is the <em>sweetest</em> thing I have ever heard.\u201d</p>\n<p> The panic recedes. Geralt is still tense- jaw clenched uncomfortably, poised on the brink of pulling out of Jaskier\u2019s arms, if the bard tells him to- but he feels a lot less like throwing up than he did a second ago. \u201cI should have asked,\u201d he says roughly. </p>\n<p> Jaskier cradles Geralt\u2019s face in his hands, forcing the witcher to meet his eyes, as he says, \u201cNo. You did just the right thing, my love. You saw a need in people you care about, and you addressed it.\u201d He smiles, blinding in the low light. \u201cYou told them that they should look for me, but anything that happened after that was completely up to me. You gave both of us a choice, yes? No one was taken advantage of, least of all me. I\u2019m grateful, truly, to be able to forge friendships with your brothers.\u201d</p>\n<p> Geralt lets out a breath he didn\u2019t know he was holding, muscles relaxing as Jaskier runs his hands down his arms. \u201cAre you sure?\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cAbsolutely, completely sure,\u201d Jaskier answers. He pulls Geralt close again, dropping kisses along the edge of his shoulder, palms soothing over his back. \u201cI\u2019m not angry, Geralt. I\u2019m proud, actually.\u201d</p>\n<p> Geralt huffs out a breath that Jaskier correctly interprets as a question. </p>\n<p> \u201cI mean it. That conversation must have been difficult, and I\u2019m damn proud that you had it.\u201d Jaskier pulls back so he can meet Geralt\u2019s eyes. \u201cHow did the topic even come up?\u201d </p>\n<p> \u201cThey cornered me in the hot spring.\u201d</p>\n<p> Jaskier practically vibrates out of his skin at that, the citrus scent of amusement mixing in the air with all of his other emotions. Fuck, Jaskier is <em>glowing.</em></p>\n<p> \u201cThey <em>cornered you</em>, in the <em>hot spring?</em>\u201d</p>\n<p> Geralt nods, and Jaskier laughs aloud- head tilted back and eyes crinkled in an expression of pure joy. \u201cSweet Melitele,\u201d he chuckles, \u201cI would pay my last coin to have witnessed <em>that</em> little conversation.\u201d</p>\n<p> He laughs away Geralt\u2019s unease. They fall asleep that way- pressed together as close as possible, barely-there smiles on each of their faces, the scent of honey and sunshine thick between them.</p>\n<p>\u2026</p>\n<p>The White Wolf and his bard carve a path through the heartland of Kaedwen for a month, leaving a path of slain monsters and musically educated villagers behind them. They fall into an easy rhythm of touches and kind words- the casual intimacy of two people who are so used to living together that it is hard to imagine anything else.<br>Geralt saves Jaskier from one or two angry beasts when he strays too close to the fight, Jaskier lets him fuss when they go back to the inn, and they fall asleep in the same bed, any arguments from the day forgotten beneath warm fingers and gentle breath. Jaskier debuts a few new songs that become instant hits. It\u2019s as beautiful as life on the Path can be.</p>\n<p> Fate draws them apart after four weeks. There are rumors of a winged beast in Aedirn that Geralt needs to look into, and a competition for bards is being held by a noblewoman in Temeria that Jaskier simply <em>must</em> win. He braids Geralt\u2019s hair the morning they part, tucking bright yellow flowers into every corner of the braid. They kiss goodbye at the crossroads with plans to meet again soon, as soon as they can. </p>\n<p> Geralt doesn\u2019t peer backward as Jaskier walks away. He definitely doesn\u2019t wait until Jaskier\u2019s figure disappears down the road before urging Roach to move. </p>\n<p> And if both those things are a lie, Jaskier never needs to know.</p>\n<p>\u2026</p>\n<p>As musical competitions go, the one Eskel is watching isn\u2019t half bad. He leans against a marble wall, surveying the crowd, and sips from a glass of wine. The nobles in the room all assume that the hostess of the event, Countess Aryemi, hired him for protection. She did not. Eskel is there for his own personal reasons. Or rather, reason. One specific reason, with bright blue eyes and an elven lute.</p>\n<p> The woman on stage finishes her last song to raucous applause. Her seat is filled a few seconds later by a man who matches Geralt\u2019s description of Jaskier perfectly. Eskel shifts out of the shadows as subtly as he can and tilts his head towards the man, making eye contact as he begins his set. The man- Jaskier, Eskel\u2019s sure of it now- grins back at him, completely unbothered by the pendant around his neck that marks him as a witcher. </p>\n<p> Jaskier\u2019s quite good with that lute of his. The crowd is on its feet by the second song, and even Eskel is nodding along to a few of the tunes that he recognizes from snippets in town squares and inns he\u2019s passed. Jaskier takes a flamboyant bow at the end of his performance, winning both the competition and the heart of every maiden in the audience. </p>\n<p> Eskel was planning to introduce himself once the mass of admirers around the bard dispersed a little, but, to his surprise, Jaskier comes right up to him after receiving his prize. He smells of triumphant joy and not a hint of uncertainty. Eskel wants to <em>live</em> in that smell. </p>\n<p> \u201cLovely to meet you, Eskel,\u201d Jaskier greets him. Eskel raises an eyebrow at the correct guess of his name, and he gets a grin in return. \u201cI know your brothers,\u201d the bard explains. </p>\n<p> \u201cI hear you\u2019re fucking one of them,\u201d Eskel says, a note of challenge in his voice. </p>\n<p> \u201cFrequently and with passion, I assure you,\u201d Jaskier shoots back. \u201cWhat brings you to this lovely corner of Temeria tonight?\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cThe music.\u201d Eskel tilts his head to the crowd. All the performances are over, but a hall full of bards is never quiet. \u201cAnd kikimore a few towns over.\u201d</p>\n<p> His mouth carries on the conversation without too much input from his brain, because Eskel\u2019s brain has flown out the fucking door. He <em>wants,</em> gods does he want, but he doesn\u2019t know how to do this. It took more effort to dress nicely and haul himself to this competition than Eskel will ever admit out loud. </p>\n<p> He doesn\u2019t have any experience asking for things that he wants. That he needs. Much less asking for something as intimate and personal as this. Eskel is just about to give up and consign himself to another few decades of ceaseless longing when Jaskier asks where he\u2019s headed next. </p>\n<p> \u201cSouth to Sodden,\u201d he answers. Jaskier leans against the wall next to him and slings an arm over Eskel\u2019s shoulder. The heat of it burns through his shirt. </p>\n<p> \u201cMind if I tag along?\u201d</p>\n<p>The next morning, Jaskier meets Eskel at the stables. He is finishing up preparations for the day\u2019s ride, packing weapons and food into his saddlebags. Jaskier has his lute, a sack full of gold from the previous night\u2019s competition, and his usual bag of clothes, snacks, and medical supplies. Enough time spent with Geralt has trained him better than any healer could. </p>\n<p> Eskel holds out his hand. Jaskier isn\u2019t sure why, so he stares at it blankly. The witcher snorts at him. </p>\n<p> \u201cYour stuff?\u201d he prompts. </p>\n<p> \u201cOh!\u201d Jaskier hands over his bags, fingers lingering on his instrument. Eskel takes it gingerly and ties it to the horse so it won\u2019t fall off or get bumped as they ride. He slings himself onto the horse and holds out his hand again. </p>\n<p> \u201cYou coming?\u201d</p>\n<p> Jaskier takes the hand with a giddy smile. Geralt <em>never</em> lets him ride. \u201cWill your horse be alright with the extra load?\u201d</p>\n<p> Eskel pulls him up and sets him on the horse in one easy move. \u201cYou don\u2019t weight much, bard. We\u2019ll go slower than I would normally, but she\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p>\n<p> They set out from town at an easy clip. It\u2019s been a while since Jaskier rode a horse but he is, technically, nobility, so his childhood involved quite a few riding lessons. Riding <em>with</em> someone is new, though. Jaskier only ever gets on Roach if someone is injured, and it\u2019s usually him. </p>\n<p> It\u2019s a shame, Jaskier thinks, that he doesn\u2019t ride with Geralt more often. Because this is <em>lovely.</em> He\u2019s settled at the front of the saddle- Eskel has a few inches on him, so he can see - and the witcher\u2019s arms are around him, holding the reins. Jaskier leans back into the hold, soaking up Eskel\u2019s body heat to combat the spring morning chill. </p>\n<p> He was wondering when Eskel\u2019s path would cross his own. It seems an accident that they met at the palace, but he knows better. Eskel sought him out. Jaskier knows how much bravery that must have taken. He knows how much pain Eskel must be in to make such bravery necessary. </p>\n<p> Jaskier notices the sharp inhale of breath when his back presses flush against Eskel\u2019s chest, but he doesn\u2019t say anything. Just closes his eyes and relaxes, hoping that the man behind him will take the cue to relax a little as well. His muscles are held perfectly still, corded and taut like he\u2019s balancing on the edge of a knife blade. It looks exhausting. </p>\n<p> Eskel shifts, his arms twitching inward, brushing against Jaskier\u2019s sides. He\u2019s holding himself just barely out of reach, touching as little as possible. If Jaskier had witcher senses, he\u2019s sure Eskel would smell of nervousness. Of longing. </p>\n<p> Jaskier sits forward a little, pulls Eskel\u2019s arms tight around him, and relaxes back again, trying to make the motion feel natural. Trying to get Eskel to accept it without fear or fanfare. </p>\n<p> \u201cWhere were you before Temeria?\u201d he asks. </p>\n<p> Eskel launches into a halting, awkward description of his weeks in Cintra and Jaskier cuddles back against him, pleased when the witcher doesn\u2019t move his arms away. He tells his own stories when Eskel is done, speaking of monsters and songs, of beautiful women and angry husbands, of his time at university, learning his craft. Jaskier lets his voice carry them and, with every passing mile, Eskel curls a little closer.</p>\n<p>\u2026</p>\n<p>The tavern smells like piss and the ale tastes worse. That\u2019s all Lambert can focus on as he leans his head against the wall, holding down a groan. His entire right side is plastered with bruises- courtesy of a particularly vicious striga and the ungrateful town it lived near. The pain wouldn\u2019t bother him so much if his ale were better.</p>\n<p> Not for the first time, he wonders what he\u2019d be doing if Jaskier were with him. Bathing more, probably. He wouldn\u2019t be so cold at night. The bruises on his side would fade beneath a gentle touch. Even his piss-poor ale wouldn\u2019t be so bad with Jaskier singing in the background. </p>\n<p> No wonder Geralt keeps him around. And no wonder he showed up at Kaer Morhen a changed man- Lambert was barely around Jaskier a week, and already he can feel something in him shifting. The Path doesn\u2019t seem so harsh, nor the fighting so hard, when he thinks about collapsing into bed and being held. </p>\n<p> <em>Don\u2019t make destiny do all the work next time. Come find me.</em></p>\n<p> Lambert will. He\u2019ll find his way back into Jaskier\u2019s arms if it costs him a limb to do it, but not yet. The monsters don\u2019t stop just because Lambert is lonely. There is work to be done before he can allow himself a rest. </p>\n<p> He takes a swig from his tankard, grimacing as it goes down. At the front of the tavern, a young bard takes the stage. Her short hair falls pleasingly around a face that\u2019s set with determination. Lambert listens idly as he eats, already planning where to head next. </p>\n<p> The bard plays a few songs he knows, mostly sea shanties from Skellige, before moving onto longer ballads. Epics. She sings of the White Wolf and his exploits, bringing Geralt\u2019s adventures to life. It\u2019s strange to hear Jaskier\u2019s words sung by another, but it isn\u2019t unpleasant. </p>\n<p> He nods along to a few, remembering warm nights when Jaskier would pluck at his lute in the quiet of their room, working out new material that Lambert wasn\u2019t around long enough to hear. The female bard finishes one epic and launches into another, this time about a witcher\u2019s heroic battle with a chimaera. </p>\n<p> A chimaera. </p>\n<p> Lambert sits up straight and starts to listen properly, teasing out every word the bard says. Her voice rises to the heavens, singing of an epic sword fight and a terrible beast. Of the man who fought to protect a city. Of the horrible scar he received as a reward.</p>\n<p> He presses a hand to the ridged skin beneath his armor, tracing the path a chimaera\u2019s claws traced so many years ago. Because this song isn\u2019t about the White Wolf. It\u2019s about him. It\u2019s about Lambert. </p>\n<p> And suddenly, Jaskier doesn\u2019t feel so far away.</p>\n<p>\u2026</p>\n<p>Eskel calls a halt as the sun goes down. Alone, he usually rides through the night, or at least walks his horse, but he is not alone. Jaskier is with him, curled up against Eskel\u2019s chest as though he finds nothing to fear in the arms of a witcher.</p>\n<p> \u201cWe\u2019ll make camp here,\u201d he says. Jaskier slides off the horse and immediately Eskel feels the loss. He hadn\u2019t noticed how cold it was. </p>\n<p> They make a fire. Eskel hunts a few rabbits and Jaskier skins them perfectly, laying the furs out to dry before handing over the meat to be cooked. Eskel doesn\u2019t know why he expected the bard to be squeamish, but clearly he has adjusted to life on the Path. The rabbits are skewered and ready to roast a few minutes later. A hand on Eskel\u2019s shoulder stops him before he can put them on the fire. </p>\n<p> \u201cWait,\u201d Jaskier says, rummaging through his bag. \u201cI brought something for this.\u201d He pulls out three pouches of spice. Eskel can smell how fresh they are. Jaskier must have picked them up that morning before they met at the stables. </p>\n<p> \u201cWhy?\u201d Eskel asks. It seems a stupid question, but he says it with honesty. He has always eaten the meat he hunts plain. </p>\n<p> Jaskier scoffs and rolls his eyes fondly. \u201cI know you witchers believe in dealing with things in stoic silence, but there\u2019s no need to be miserable about it. Food should have <em>flavor</em>, darling, even when you hunt it yourself.\u201d</p>\n<p> Eskel takes the pouches in gob smacked silence. Carrying spice for cooking on the road is such an obvious idea, yet he hasn\u2019t thought of it, even after a life spent on the Path. He mixes the spices together in the bowl he carries for grinding potion ingredients, rubs each rabbit with some of the mixture, and pops the meat over the fire. It\u2019s the best meal he\u2019s had in ages. </p>\n<p> After they eat, Jaskier leans against a tree and strums at his lute. The music is all low tones, pitched to match the night around them. Eskel sits at the fire, aching to press himself close to the bard, but uncertain how to go about it. </p>\n<p> \u201cIt\u2019s a beautiful lute,\u201d he says. </p>\n<p> Jaskier\u2019s eyes glow with pleasure in the firelight. \u201cThank you. It was a gift, from the first adventure I ever went on with Geralt.\u201d</p>\n<p> Eskel\u2019s eyes catch on the strings of the lute. They\u2019re metal. An odd detail, especially given the instrument\u2019s origins. </p>\n<p> \u201cI thought elven lutes used gut strings,\u201d he says. </p>\n<p> Jaskier glances down at his hands, as if reminding himself what his instrument is made of. \u201cYes, I had to have them replaced after-\u201c He gasps and raises his head to meet Eskel\u2019s eyes. \u201cHow did you know that?\u201d</p>\n<p> Eskel shrugs. \u201cI pay attention to the world around me.\u201d It\u2019s a vague answer, a silly answer, and they both know it. </p>\n<p> \u201cNice try,\u201d Jaskier laughs, \u201cbut I don\u2019t believe you. Did you study elven music or something at Kaer Morhen?\u201d He scrutinizes Eskel for a moment before a shit-eating grin spreads across his face. \u201cYou <em>play.</em>\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cNo, I don\u2019t,\u201d Eskel says, too quickly. </p>\n<p> \u201cYou <em>do!</em>\u201d Jaskier crows. He\u2019s practically bouncing where he sits, looking at Eskel with an expression of unbridled joy. \u201cYou can\u2019t lie to me, witcher. I see the cracks in that armor of yours.\u201d He leans in like they\u2019re sharing a secret, whispering so only enhanced hearing could pick up on his words. \u201cYou play the lute!\u201d</p>\n<p> Even if Eskel wanted to resist that smile, he couldn\u2019t. He\u2019s too punch drunk on the smell of rapturous joy rippling off Jaskier\u2019s skin. \u201cFine. I do play, a little.\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cYes!\u201d Jaskier shoots up from his seat against the tree and practically trips over himself to reach Eskel\u2019s side, dropping his lute unceremoniously in Eskel\u2019s lap once he does. \u201cProof!\u201d he cries. </p>\n<p> \u201cIt\u2019s been years-\u201c </p>\n<p> Jaskier waves off his protests. \u201cYou\u2019ll remember. Come on, anything. I\u2019m sure you know a drinking song or two.\u201d </p>\n<p> He does know some drinking songs. A few ballads, too. Eskel only ever learned how to play a chord or two- long ago, when he still thought people could see witchers as something more than killing machines- but some songs only use a couple chords. He picks up the instrument, taking a second to remember how to place his fingers. Eskel strums lightly, just once, and Jaskier\u2019s scent spikes with happiness so strong that he is helpless to do anything but play. </p>\n<p> It\u2019s a slow song, because the chords are easier that way. He has forgotten the words over the years, but Jaskier doesn\u2019t seem to care. Eskel hums the melody as he plays. Across from him, Jaskier shuts his eyes and sways. </p>\n<p> Around the time the second chorus would come, Jaskier stands. Eskel\u2019s hands freeze on the strings, feeling as though he has touched something without permission. The bard settles down behind him and leans against his back. Ever so quietly, he says, \u201cDon\u2019t stop.\u201d</p>\n<p> Eskel plucks at the strings again. He\u2019s more hesitant this time, unsure of why Jaskier moved, yet not willing to break the spell that his unpracticed fingers have cast around their fire. He hums again, and this time, Jaskier sings along. </p>\n<p> The bard\u2019s voice is low and dark. It cracks against the words in a few spots, as if overcome with emotion. It\u2019s nothing like the singing Eskel heard at the Countess\u2019 mansion. This version of Jaskier is raw and open. But the best part, the part that makes Eskel\u2019s fingers tremble on the strings, is the fact that he can <em>feel</em> Jaskier sing. He can feel the vibrations of his voice where the bard is pressed against him, thrumming and powerful even through layers of cloth and armor. </p>\n<p> The song plays out and Eskel lets the lute fall through slack fingers. Jaskier\u2019s singing stops. Now that the music is over, Eskel is struck by the sudden fear that Jaskier will move away. He doesn\u2019t think he could stand it. </p>\n<p> He doesn\u2019t have to. Jaskier turns around and pulls Eskel into the space between his legs, wrapping his arms around Eskel\u2019s chest. He\u2019s so <em>close.</em></p>\n<p> \u201cThank you, Eskel. That was wonderful.\u201d</p>\n<p> A shudder works its way down his spine. He groans, the sound crawling out of some hidden, broken place within him that has not been touched in decades. Jaskier\u2019s hands pull him back and Eskel lets himself fall. The bard takes his weight without complaint. Pushes him down until Eskel\u2019s head is in his lap. </p>\n<p> Lute-calloused fingers drag through his hair. Just one hand, because the other is held against his chest, keeping him tethered to the ground. If it wasn\u2019t there, Eskel might just float away. </p>\n<p> Jaskier sings. Not of monsters or adventure, but of home, and comfort, and safety. The vibrations of it shoot through Eskel\u2019s soul. He falls asleep to songs of peace, with hands on his body and not a fear in his mind. </p>\n<p> What is there to fear, if Jaskier\u2019s arms are around him?</p>\n<p>They break camp to the tune of Jaskier\u2019s humming. Eskel puts out the fire. He slides on his armor, swords heavy across his back. It\u2019s a bright, brilliant spring morning, the air itself alight with new life. Eskel helps Jaskier onto the horse and drapes an arm around his waist. It feels right. </p>\n<p> A few hours of riding brings them to a collection of homes too small to be called a village, but small or not, they have a monster problem. The townspeople speak of hideous shrieks and a beautiful woman who turn their dreams to nightmares. Bruxa. </p>\n<p> He meets with the town\u2019s leader- a wizened old woman who invites him to her home. </p>\n<p> \u201cCan you help us, witcher?\u201d</p>\n<p> Most vampires are affected by the sun, but not bruxae. It\u2019s a blessing that Eskel can deal with these in daylight. \u201cI can.\u201d</p>\n<p> The woman bows her head in thanks. \u201cWe don\u2019t have much here to pay ye with, but we can feed and house ye for the night. Your bard, too.\u201d</p>\n<p> It\u2019s more than Eskel was expecting. He agrees with ease and goes to find Jaskier. The bard is sitting beneath a tree, playing a shorter, tamer version of one of his adventure ballads for the group of children that have gathered around him. How he manages to stir up crowds so quickly is beyond Eskel. </p>\n<p> He explains the situation and Jaskier leaps to his feet, singing abandoned. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Eskel demands. </p>\n<p> \u201cComing with you, obviously.\u201d</p>\n<p> Eskel is about to argue when Geralt\u2019s words from that winter echo back to him. </p>\n<p>\n<em>The fucking idiot doesn\u2019t know what\u2019s good for him. Can\u2019t keep him away from battles unless I tie him down. Last time I tried that, he sulked for a week.</em>\n</p>\n<p>Maybe not, then. Surely Jaskier will stay far enough away from the fight to protect himself. He\u2019s not crazy.</p>\n<p>\u2026</p>\n<p>Jaskier is fucking crazy. It\u2019s an hour later, deep in the woods, when a beautiful, dark haired woman strides out from behind a tree. Eskel doesn\u2019t see her, not until it\u2019s too late. All he hears is Jaskier say, \u201cWhy hello! Are you lost?\u201d followed by a piercing, monstrous scream.</p>\n<p> Eskel whirls just in time to see Jaskier fly backward, propelled by the bruxa\u2019s wail, his spine crunching as he collides with a tree. Red sweeps across Eskel\u2019s vision. His body quakes with rage and he launches himself forward, casting Quen to block the monster\u2019s second scream. </p>\n<p> She dances away from the edge of his silver sword. Into the underbrush they crash, decades of training the only thing that stop Eskel from tripping. There\u2019s an anger in his veins that he hasn\u2019t felt before. The bruxa screams again and he deflects it, but all he can really hear is the snap of Jaskier\u2019s body hitting hard wood, the little whimper he let out when he fell. </p>\n<p> The bruxa comes at him with her claws. She\u2019s agile, and fast. </p>\n<p> He\u2019s faster. </p>\n<p> Eskel spins out of the way. He lets the bruxa sail past him and catches her in the stomach mid-leap, silver slicing through her vicious form in a single blow. The monster falls, and Eskel is at Jaskier\u2019s side before her body hits the ground. </p>\n<p> \u201cJaskier-\u201c he gasps out. His pulse is too fast, almost that of a normal man\u2019s. He drops his sword on the dirt and kneels down, pulling Jaskier\u2019s head onto his lap. The bard\u2019s eyes flutter open as he groans. The wave of relief that washes over Eskel would have brought him to his knees if he weren\u2019t there already. </p>\n<p> \u201cThat lady,\u201d Jaskier murmurs wetly, \u201cdoes <em>not</em> like me.\u201d</p>\n<p> Eskel bows forward until their foreheads are touching. His hands are fisted in the silk of Jaskier\u2019s chemise. It\u2019s such a silly, ridiculous thing to wear on the road. Silly, and so much like Jaskier that it hurts. He focuses on how it feels against his fingers fearing that, if he doesn\u2019t, the weight of fear on his back will crush him. </p>\n<p> \u201cYou idiot,\u201d he chokes out. </p>\n<p> \u201cI know.\u201d A hand reaches up to touch Eskel\u2019s face, and the voice that comes with it is soft. \u201cI\u2019m fine, Eskel. A nasty throw, maybe a scratch or two, nothing worse than that.\u201d </p>\n<p> Jaskier scoots away to sit up, but Eskel can\u2019t let go of him. He moves with the bard, pulling him up and onto his lap to hold him close. To make sure he\u2019s still whole. </p>\n<p> This panic, this fear in Eskel\u2019s bones, is terrifying because of how <em>new</em> it is. He\u2019s used to monsters and blood, used to swinging his sword and accepting that maybe, just maybe, this time he won\u2019t make it out alive. The Path is what he was raised to follow. But this? Going into a fight with the knowledge that it\u2019s up to him to keep Jaskier safe? He doesn\u2019t know how Geralt can stand it. </p>\n<p> Strong, unbroken hands tangle in his hair and tug. </p>\n<p> \u201cEskel. I\u2019m alright.\u201d Sunshine seeps into Jaskier\u2019s smell, breaking through the metallic scent of pain. \u201cIn my defense, I didn\u2019t know that the very beautiful, very lost young lady was some kind of demon-beast-thingy.\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cVampire,\u201d Eskel corrects. </p>\n<p> \u201cVampire,\u201d Jaskier agrees. \u201cSee, this is why all that witchery knowledge of yours is so helpful. I never would\u2019ve guessed vampire, what with the screeching and the claws and all.\u201d</p>\n<p> His voice is too jovial for someone who just got slammed against a tree. The absurdity of it breaks through Eskel\u2019s panic and he hauls in a deep breath. </p>\n<p> \u201cCan you stand?\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cOf course I can-\u201c Jaskier tries to get up and his left leg collapses beneath him. Eskel catches him before he can fall. \u201cI can mostly stand.\u201d</p>\n<p> He could probably make it back to town without much trouble. Probably. Eskel isn\u2019t quite sure how fragile humans really are, and he isn\u2019t keen on finding out. He swings his sword into its sheath, picks Jaskier up as gently as he can- one arm under his legs, one behind his back- and beings the long trudge home.</p>\n<p>\u2026</p>\n<p>On the outskirts of a town in the heart of Aedirn, Geralt lops off a kikimore\u2019s head. It slams to the ground and the young woman beside it, who was about to become its next victim, pukes into the swamp water. Geralt waits until she\u2019s done, then offers her a hand up.</p>\n<p> To his surprise, she takes it. </p>\n<p> Rattled, she leads him back to town. Her family meets them at the road, throwing arms around their daughter and weeping with joy. The monster is dead. The humans are safe. Geralt turns to go. </p>\n<p> \u201cWait!\u201d It\u2019s the mother. She is a tall woman, skin tan from days spent working the fields. Her long hair is tied back with colorful ribbons, falling nearly to her knees. She approaches him with hesitance, but not terror. \u201cYou\u2019re him, aren\u2019t you? The one the songs are about?\u201d</p>\n<p> Geralt does not know how to respond, so he simply stares. He\u2019s used to people knowing him, or at least his title. Butcher. Killer, monster, mutant. </p>\n<p> \u201cYou\u2019re the White Wolf,\u201d the woman says, and she throws her arms around him. </p>\n<p> The hug is brief, and, on Geralt\u2019s side, stiff. But her scent is one of gratitude, of happiness, and Geralt soaks it in, stunned. She pulls away a moment later. </p>\n<p> \u201cThank you,\u201d she whispers. \u201cWe don\u2019t have any money, but-\u201c The woman reaches up to her hair and pulls away two ribbons. One black, one a rich purple. She presses them into Geralt\u2019s palm. \u201cFor you, and that bard of yours. May the gods lay blessings at your feet, witcher. May they repay the kindness you have shown us this day.\u201d</p>\n<p> She returns to her family, leaving Geralt with Roach. He feels as though the world has collapsed beneath him, and he does not know how to stop it. He doesn\u2019t think he wants to. </p>\n<p> Geralt rides away. He returns to his life of fighting and killing, of being spat on in pubs and leered at on the street. Of longing for Jaskier, wherever he is now. Geralt bears the insults. He walks the Path. </p>\n<p> But next time Geralt tears apart a monster, there is a single black ribbon tied to the hilt of his sword.</p>\n<p>\u2026</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d</p>\n<p> Eskel is perched on the edge of his chair, wary, but somehow also feeling like a chastised child as the farmer whose house he\u2019s in sighs down at him. </p>\n<p> \u201cCertain. You\u2019ve done us a great service, and your friend needs to stay off his leg for the night. We don\u2019t mind housing you, long as you two don\u2019t mind sharing a bed.\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cWe don\u2019t mind,\u201d Eskel assures her. At least, he doesn\u2019t mind. Jaskier probably won\u2019t either, and isn\u2019t that a thought? A human, sharing Eskel\u2019s bed without fear or complaint. It\u2019s almost as much of a miracle as strangers taking them in for the night. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p>\n<p> The farmer\u2019s face softens. \u201c\u2019Course. That bard of yours works wonders. I swear he\u2019s got half the town eating out of his hand already.\u201d</p>\n<p> Eskel believes it. He thanks her again, then begs exhaustion and goes to find his bard. </p>\n<p> Jaskier is stretched out on top of their bed for the night, leg above the covers, strumming idly at the lute in his hands. There isn\u2019t a tune really, just music, and Eskel is grateful to have something that breaks the silence besides the roar of the fire behind them.</p>\n<p> \u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d he asks, bending to check the bard's bandages. The cuts Jaskier got from his altercation with the bruxa weren\u2019t deep, but they still needed tending to. Eskel is careful as he peels back the cloth to look for infection, all too aware of his own strength. He can\u2019t stand the thought of pushing too hard and accidentally injuring Jaskier further. No matter how quickly he seems to be healing. </p>\n<p> \u201cRight as rain, darling. Nothing I haven\u2019t dealt with before, and this mattress is lovely.\u201d Jaskier sighs dramatically, scooting back against the pillows. The bed is as nice as most inns\u2019, and certainly more comfortable than the dirt they slept on last night. \u201cI might sleep for a week after all this excitement, but that would be overstaying our welcome, and I am nothing if not polite, really, so we must be on our way. And- Eskel, stop fussing.\u201d</p>\n<p> Eskel hadn\u2019t noticed he was fussing, but he is. He\u2019s fiddling with the loose edge of one of the bandages and digging sharp fingernails into the meat of his thigh. \u201cSorry.\u201d</p>\n<p> Jaskier, for once, is silent. He catches Eskel\u2019s eye and keeps it there, filling the space between them with unspoken meaning. It\u2019s so <em>tender</em>, Eskel can\u2019t take it. He feels his years of trained stoicism slip away under cornflower blue eyes; stripped bare, seen and understood, but not judged. A question spills past his lips, unbidden. </p>\n<p> \u201cWhy?\u201d</p>\n<p> The bard raises an eyebrow. \u201cYou\u2019re going to have to be more specific, dear, because that might be the vaguest thing I\u2019ve ever been asked, and I travel with Geralt.\u201d</p>\n<p> Eskel wants to tear his eyes away, to hide. He can\u2019t. Flickers of light from the fire dance in Jaskier\u2019s eyes, mixing there with fond confusion. </p>\n<p> \u201cWhy do you stay? In this life, with Geralt? Why ask to travel with me when all it means is rough nights outside, and shitty meals, and, and-\u201c Eskel\u2019s fingers dig into his thigh as deep as they can go without ripping the material. \u201cWhy are you <em>here?</em>\u201d</p>\n<p> Jaskier regards him with something akin to sadness in his eyes. But there\u2019s something warm there, too. Something joyful. </p>\n<p> \u201cWhy do I stay with Geralt?\u201d he echoes. \u201cBecause I love him. As deeply as one soul can love another. I would take a sword to the heart any day if it kept him safe, and I know he would do the same for me. How could I not stay, for love like that?\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cBut-\u201c </p>\n<p> Jaskier shakes his head, and the protest dies on Eskel\u2019s lips. \u201cI won\u2019t lie, I don\u2019t love the rough nights. They\u2019re not as bad as they used to be, though. Geralt has gotten better at staying in inns, and at bringing more comforts with us to make the road less unpleasant. But that\u2019s not what you were asking.\u201d He reaches down to take Eskel\u2019s face in his hands, those eyes holding the witcher still as any spell, and slips his fingers into the violent grip Eskel has on his own leg. \u201cWhy am I <em>here?</em> For adventure. For stories. I am here to let the world tear me open and spit me back out how it pleases, because I cannot imagine a better way to <em>live.</em>\u201d</p>\n<p> Eskel is shaking. Falling apart, here in the arms of the most foolish bard he has ever met. Foolish, and brave. Too perceptive for his own damn good. Eskel holds himself up on shaky arms and watches the firelight dance in Jaskier\u2019s eyes. \u201cThis life will burn you,\u201d he whispers. </p>\n<p> Jaskier tugs, just once, and Eskel collapses. His body falls against his will. His arms grasp at Jaskier desperately, hungrily, and he buries his face in the bard\u2019s hair, pulling him close as though Eskel can protect him. Arms come around him in return. Strong and warm and unafraid. Jaskier\u2019s lips ghost over his ear as he speaks his answer. </p>\n<p> \u201cIf this life is doomed to burn me, dear witcher, I shall light the pyre myself.\u201d</p>\n<p>Two weeks later, Jaskier\u2019s leg is completely healed. He and Eskel are halfway across Sodden by then, sleeping mostly on the road and sharing a bedroll every night. Jaskier is content, glowingly so, but he misses Geralt terribly, and Eskel hears of a beast further south that he decides is too dangerous for company. </p>\n<p> The two are lying in bed, wrapped up together, when the time comes to part. Eskel rises with the dawn and Jaskier rises with him, unwilling to let the witcher slip away without a proper goodbye. With his bags packed and his armor on, Eskel turns to his bard. </p>\n<p> \u201cMay I find you again?\u201d he asks. \u201cSomeday?\u201d</p>\n<p> Jaskier pulls him close. He\u2019s astounded how easily Eskel lets himself be moved, unsure of what he did to earn the trust of a man so accustomed to rejection. It warms his chest, and he hopes that Eskel can smell it, can understand the truth in his answer. \u201cAny day,\u201d he swears. \u201cI look forward to it.\u201d</p>\n<p> Eskel nods. He leans forward to brush his lips against Jaskier\u2019s cheek; so soft they\u2019re barely there. Jaskier is beaming when he pulls away. He watches as the witcher leaves their room, follows the streak of black out the window as he rides away, and settles down to sleep once more with the smile still bright on his face.</p>\n<p>\u2026</p>\n<p>Geralt finds him a few days later, just as Jaskier knew he would. The town he and Eskel parted in is more of a city than anything, with plenty of taverns to perform in and enough amusements to keep Jaskier busy for weeks. He makes sure he\u2019s seen walking the streets, leaving no doubt in the people\u2019s minds that this is the White Wolf\u2019s bard. Word will travel quickly, and when it does, it will reach Geralt\u2019s ears, sending him across the continent to Jaskier\u2019s side.</p>\n<p> Whispers come to him in a tavern one night of a slain selkiemore a few miles away. Jaskier knows what that means. He brings his lute and sits on the edge of the town\u2019s main road, playing love ballads into the empty night air until he hears the thunder of hooves and the clatter of weaponry that means his witcher has returned to him once more. </p>\n<p> \u201cJaskier,\u201d comes the low rumble. He\u2019s swept from his feet into a searing, filthy kiss that leaves no question as to what Geralt plans for the night. His lute falls to the ground as he raises his hands to hold Geralt closer. Jaskier\u2019s voice is halfway to wrecked by the time he pulls away. </p>\n<p> \u201cGood to see you too, Geralt. Why don\u2019t we go find a-\u201c His breath hitches as Geralt\u2019s hands find their way under his chemise. \u201cA room, love. <em>Now</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u2026</p>\n<p>Geralt drops his head between Jaskier\u2019s sweat slicked shoulder blades and breathes. Sunshine and honey sweep over him, refreshing after so many nights apart. It terrifies him, how much he needs this. Every time he\u2019s apart from Jaskier he tells himself that their reunion will be casual, easy, and every time his plans are swept away by the all-consuming wave of affection and lust that crashes over him as soon as he lays eyes on tousled brown hair above colorful silk doublets.</p>\n<p> He wonders, sometimes, how he managed to walk the Path for so long without this. It seems that he should have tired years before now, should have slowed down just a fraction too much and gotten his head taken off by the nearest thing with claws and teeth. Geralt thanks the gods that he did not. That he survived long enough to have Jaskier in his arms. </p>\n<p> \u201cWhat do you think, Geralt? Geralt?\u201d</p>\n<p> Lifting his head, Geralt tries to remember what Jaskier was talking about. It\u2019s no use- he wasn\u2019t paying attention. </p>\n<p> \u201cHmmm?\u201d</p>\n<p> Jaskier slaps his arm lightly. \u201cYou oaf. I knew you weren\u2019t listening to me.\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cAnd you spoke anyway.\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cYes, well,\u201d Jaskier has the decency to look bashful. \u201cI do that a lot. And you only pay attention half the time anyway, so I don\u2019t know why I bother.\u201d He huffs out a sigh, but the smile on his face ruins it. \u201cI was asking what you think about going to Skellige for a while. I\u2019m sure they have plenty of monsters out there, and I would so love to see the ocean. It\u2019s been quite a while since the last time I was there. It\u2019ll be beautiful in summer, too, so-\u201c</p>\n<p> Geralt cuts him off with a kiss, the only way he has found after fourteen years of research to reliably shut Jaskier up. \u201cSkellige is fine.\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cGood. Great, actually.\u201d A dopey grin works its way across Jaskier\u2019s face, followed by a spike in the smell of honey wine. \u201c<em>Geralt,</em>\u201d he murmurs, rolling over to press Geralt into the mattress. And that\u2019s the end of talking for the night.</p>\n<p>\u2026</p>\n<p>They go to Skellige. Geralt slays a few water monsters with enough teeth to tear an army apart. He takes a particularly strange one and makes it into a necklace for Jaskier. It\u2019s ugly, and kind of gross, and Jaskier wears it every day.</p>\n<p> Spring merges slowly into summer, days lengthening as Jaskier switches out his layers for thin, breezy shirts that dance in the ocean wind. Geralt\u2019s white hair practically gleams in the summer sun. Jaskier\u2019s skin picks up a pleasant tan that makes his eyes shine blue as the sky above them. </p>\n<p> A town on the coast kicks them out, unwilling to serve \u201ca witcher and his whore.\u201d Geralt nearly guts the man that said it, more out of fury over Jaskier\u2019s honor than his own, but Jaskier talks him out of it with pleading eyes and quite a bit of shouting. They camp on the road that night. It\u2019s rough, and hot. Much less pleasant than an inn, especially with the knowledge of <em>why</em> they\u2019re camping hanging over their heads like a particularly nasty insult. But when Jaskier slides into his lap after dinner, kissing like he\u2019s drowning and muttering compliments against bare skin, Geralt can\u2019t find it in himself to care. </p>\n<p> Some towns welcome them. The people have heard of the White Wolf and his bard. Rare as it is, sometimes Geralt is invited in with open arms and promises of good food and plenty of coin, if only he can take care of a few monsters. Sometimes, the heads he brings back as proof of contract are met with cheers instead of revulsion. </p>\n<p> Jaskier learns new songs, and writes some of his own. More often than not, he collapses into bed after a night of dancing around bonfires and singing lyrics that would make a brothel owner blush. He smells of sun and sand and <em>joy.</em> Geralt presses close on those nights, soaking in the feeling of Jaskier\u2019s body, hard and real against him. </p>\n<p> Geralt picks up new scars. There\u2019s a gash on his right hip from some ghouls that he wasn\u2019t fast enough to dodge. Three little dots on his left shoulder from a bruxa\u2019s claws. Two matching lines decorate one of his thighs, courtesy of a monster he could not identify but killed anyway. Those two would be a lot worse if the local healer had not welcomed them, but she did, and he thanked her heartily for it in his own gruff way. </p>\n<p> He doesn\u2019t mind the scars. They are reminders of who he is, of his trade as a witcher. And if Jaskier likes to run his lips over them, or to touch them and then place gentle fingers over Geralt\u2019s pulse, as though to remind himself his witcher still lives and breathes- well, Geralt doesn\u2019t mind that, either. </p>\n<p> When they tire of seafood and crashing waves, they move on to Verden. Jaskier debuts new songs, most of them epics, some of which contain stories Geralt does not recognize. Only when he sits down one night to listen, <em>really</em> listen, does he realize that they are about his brothers. His brothers, who have carved their names on Jaskier\u2019s heart just as surely as Geralt, albeit in a different way. Warmth seeps through him as he listens, and it isn\u2019t from the ale. </p>\n<p> Those songs are on his mind when he and Jaskier separate once more. A nobleman in Kerack requests Jaskier\u2019s presence at his court for a week of revelry in honor of his marriage. Jaskier chooses to go. On the morning he is set to leave, Geralt strides into the nearest mage\u2019s shop and slams down a silver coin. </p>\n<p> \u201cI need to send a message.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u2026</p>\n<p>A flash of green light has Lambert on his feet in seconds. Magic. He can smell it. Cautiously, he approaches the spot where he saw the light, a scant few feet from his campfire. There are no beasts he can see, no magical symbols that spell trouble. A tiny scrap of paper lies on the ground, marked by a wax seal that bears the imprint of a familiar wolf pendant.</p>\n<p> <em>Jaskier will be at Lord Slater\u2019s estate in Kerack next week. Keep him safe.</em></p>\n<p> Lambert doesn\u2019t wait until dawn. He packs his bags, kicks out his fire, and sets off down the road feeling lighter than he has in months. </p>\n<p> Once he\u2019s in Kerack- a mere three days later, the fastest he has ever traveled- it\u2019s easy to track down Lord Slater. A few days after that, when Slater\u2019s guests begin to arrive, it\u2019s even easier to track down Jaskier. He follows the smell of comfort. </p>\n<p> Jaskier is, somehow, more colorful than the last time Lambert saw him. He\u2019s sun kissed and heat flushed in the summer\u2019s night. The patterns on his doublet are picked out in metallic thread, flashing in the torchlight as he jokes and plays his way through the party. His lute is there, of course. It has a single purple ribbon tied to one of the tuning knobs at the top. </p>\n<p> Lambert waits to approach him, content with watching for a bit before he\u2019s noticed. The revelers love Jaskier. They cheer as he sings, smiles loose from music and fine wine, and Jaskier grins back at them, all sunshine and teeth. </p>\n<p> But no smile is as bright as the one on Jaskier\u2019s face when he spots Lambert. </p>\n<p> He finishes up the set with one final song, eyes on Lambert the entire time. The guests that reach out to him are brushed away as Jaskier saunters over to Lambert, face alight with joy. Arms outstretched. </p>\n<p> Lambert didn\u2019t wear armor to the banquet. He figured it wouldn\u2019t be necessary, if he weren\u2019t on the job. It would stand out. It would be hot, and uncomfortable. All true reasons, all honest. </p>\n<p> Who is he kidding? </p>\n<p> Lambert didn\u2019t wear armor to the banquet because it would have gotten in the way of <em>this</em>. Of the heat of Jaskier\u2019s skin though his shirt and the firmness of his chest and the almost-painful ache of a hug so tight Lambert thinks it might break him. Calloused fingers come up to cradle Lambert\u2019s face as Jaskier says, with utter elation in his voice, \u201cYou found me again.\u201d Then, softer, \u201cWelcome back.\u201d</p>\n<p> After the party, they retire to Lambert\u2019s room. Jaskier strips out of his finery, chattering away about Lady Slater\u2019s cooking, and one of his necklaces catches Lambert\u2019s eye. </p>\n<p> \u201cIs that a tooth?\u201d</p>\n<p> Jaskier throws his head back on a laugh. \u201cDo you like it? Geralt made it for me this summer, in Skellige.\u201d </p>\n<p> Of course it\u2019s from Geralt. Lambert doesn\u2019t know why he bothered asking. \u201cHow were the islands?\u201d</p>\n<p> Jaskier, fully undressed now, besides his smallclothes, throws himself onto the bed like he belongs there. He gestures for Lambert to get undressed as well, and Lambert complies. Shame still crawls up his throat at how much he craves what\u2019s about to happen, but it isn\u2019t as bad as the first time. There is no need to deny himself any more than the world has already denied him. </p>\n<p> Lambert crawls into bed and settles himself into the space between Jaskier\u2019s legs. He leans against Jaskier\u2019s chest, skin to blessed skin, and lets Jaskier\u2019s hands trace over his body, slipping into dreams with whispered words of ocean waves in his ears. </p>\n<p> That\u2019s the second time. </p>\n<p> It isn\u2019t the last.</p>\n<p>\u2026</p>\n<p>Eskel finds him again as the first leaves of autumn flutter to the ground. They camp by the side of the road and Eskel pulls a satchel free from his saddlebags to offer to Jaskier. It\u2019s full of spices from every corner of the continent, as carefully labeled and organized as the witcher\u2019s potions. They eat like kings.</p>\n<p> A drowner leaves a scratch down one of Eskel\u2019s calves and Jaskier sews him up. In and out dips the needle. In and out Eskel breathes. In and out, gentler than he has ever felt, Jaskier\u2019s fingers more careful with each knot than Eskel ever is with himself. It aches, this closeness. Eskel prays for its return every time it ends. </p>\n<p> When the wound has closed enough to stand it, they jump into a stream together. The water is freezing but Jaskier\u2019s body is warm. Eskel welcomes the fingers that thread through his hair, accompanied by a voice that teases him for its unruliness, and he resolves, next time they\u2019re in town, to buy some oils for it that smell of the same spices as Jaskier\u2019s skin. </p>\n<p> He finds one that\u2019s close, but no artificial scent compares. </p>\n<p> They separate in Cidaris. They swing back together in Temeria. </p>\n<p> Jaskier is filled to the brim with a feeling he cannot place. Contentment, he thinks one day, but that isn\u2019t quite right. It\u2019s not happiness. Not pleasure. It soaks into his bones. It runs under his skin like lightning one moment and swirls around his throat the next. He does not name the feeling until the seventh time that year when he and Geralt travel their separate ways. </p>\n<p> Geralt disappears over the horizon, his figure swallowed by the setting sun. Jaskier knows he will return in a week. He will ride back into town like a god from the old ballads and sweep Jaskier into his arms without a second thought. The sun rises. The sun sets. Geralt will return. </p>\n<p> He is alone for a single day. Then Eskel finds him, lips brimming with stories for Jaskier\u2019s songs, and Jaskier finally figures out what that feeling is. Or rather, what the feeling <em>isn\u2019t.</em></p>\n<p> Jaskier is not lonely. He hasn\u2019t been lonely in months- a year, nearly. Not since the past winter, when three witchers lived together in Kaer Morhen and he only knew to miss one of them. </p>\n<p> It will hurt more this year, he knows, to be parted from them all. But he also knows that, as soon as the mountains thaw and warmth returns to the air, they will be back in his arms. The sun rises. The sun sets. His witchers will return.</p>\n<p>\u2026</p>\n<p>Purple light flashes in front of Roach. She doesn\u2019t startle, of course not, and Geralt pats the side of her neck as he dismounts. He has sent enough letters by mage to recognize the flare of magic.</p>\n<p> The note is a single sheet of folded paper. It contains two lines of orderly handwriting. Eskel\u2019s hand. </p>\n<p> <em>Bring the bard this winter. If he wants.</em></p>\n<p> Geralt is only a little horrified to find himself smiling down at the note. His brother has read his mind. He feeds the paper to his fire that night and sets out early the next morning, sliding into a booth at the local tavern just in time to catch the tail end of Jaskier\u2019s performance. </p>\n<p> He waits until they\u2019re undressed and relaxing by the fire before bending his mouth to Jaskier\u2019s ear. \u201cCome with me to Kaer Morhen this winter.\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cReally?\u201d The sharp scent of excitement floods Geralt\u2019s senses. </p>\n<p> \u201cYes. It is long past time.\u201d</p>\n<p> Jaskier turns to him with eyes that could put the sun to shame. \u201cGeralt,\u201d he whispers. He drops kisses on Geralt\u2019s forehead. His cheeks. The side of his neck. Jaskier presses his mouth to every inch of skin he can reach, and between kisses he murmurs, \u201cMy dear, sweet Geralt. My heart. I would love nothing more.\u201d</p>\n<p>Eskel and Lambert showed up to Kaer Morhen three weeks earlier than usual. Vesemir was a little surprised to see Eskel ride in before the air turned truly cold, and even more surprised when Lambert followed a day later. After making sure that neither were being chased by a beast or vengeful sorcerer, he brushed the odd behavior off as the product of a difficult year. </p>\n<p> But the oddities did not stop with their early arrival. </p>\n<p> Both witchers went about their daily tasks with single-minded focus. They cooked, chopped firewood, prepared potions, and trained- all with far fewer jokes or petty squabbles than Vesemir had come to expect at wintertime. Even stranger was the fact that Lambert and Eskel were cleaning. <em>Willingly.</em></p>\n<p> Not the usual dusting that Kaer Morhen got after so long with only one occupant. Not that at all. Every nook of the castle was scrubbed within an inch of its life. Eskel cleared the massive fireplace in the main hall as if every spot of ash were a personal offense. Lambert found a container of varnish from the gods only knew where and set about polishing every piece of wood in the castle until the place practically glowed with rich, earthen tones. </p>\n<p> Vesemir tried asking about the unusual behavior, but he was rebuffed. Questions about Eskel\u2019s incessant firewood chopping were met with a cheeky, \u201cWhat, don\u2019t you want to be warm this winter?\u201d Inquiries into Lambert\u2019s cleaning were turned on their head with, \u201cI thought you wanted us to clean? I can stop, if it bothers you that much.\u201d </p>\n<p> He had a point about the cleaning. They both did, actually, and that was precisely the problem. All of their clever answers felt rehearsed. As if they knew they would be acting strangely and had planned out responses for any concern Vesemir might raise. It irked him, but he could find nothing to complain about. Soon enough, he gave up searching for answers. They would come to him or they wouldn\u2019t. Either way, the chores got done. </p>\n<p> Now, though, Vesemir wonders if he should have pressed more. The castle gleams. The stable is immaculate. There is enough firewood stacked in a shed outside to heat the entire castle year round for a decade, and Lambert and Eskel are restless. They scent the air constantly, sending furtive glances to the front of the castle whenever they think Vesemir isn\u2019t looking. Sparring and weapons practice is the only time of day he can get some gods damned <em>peace</em>, and even that is tainted by the knowledge that whatever is eating at his boys has not gone away. It has merely been redirected. </p>\n<p> Vesemir is no fool. It\u2019s clear enough that the tension in the air comes from expectation. Lambert and Eskel are waiting for something. The only question now is\u2026 what?</p>\n<p>\u2026</p>\n<p>Jaskier insists that he and Geralt make a final stop at the city nearest Kaer Morhen before making their final ascent. \u201cI need to get some supplies,\u201d he explains. Geralt lets out a grunt of confusion.</p>\n<p> \u201cThe castle is stocked. We have food and drink plenty for the winter. What do you need?\u201d</p>\n<p> Jaskier shakes his head in amusement before dancing away towards the city market, a rather large bag of coin bouncing at his hip. \u201cSometimes it\u2019s not about need, darling. It\u2019s about <em>want.\"</em></p>\n<p> Unbeknownst to Geralt, Jaskier has been plotting this shopping spree for weeks. He and Geralt slept in the woods more often than usual, and when they did stay at inns, Jaskier made sure to play often, play long, and spend as little as possible on ale. Not his favorite few weeks, to be sure, but he has plans. Plans that need money. </p>\n<p> He vanishes into the market stalls. Geralt stays at the inn, like Jaskier knew he would, because one hour of shopping takes more social interaction than Geralt usually deals with in a month. Other than Jaskier, of course, but he hardly counts.</p>\n<p> Hours later, Jaskier stumbles back into their room. Night has fallen, and Geralt waits for him by firelight, eyes turned suspiciously to the two large bundles and one hard case in Jaskier\u2019s arms. \u201cWe are climbing a mountain tomorrow, Jaskier. We can\u2019t carry anything extravagant.\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cI know,\u201d Jaskier says brightly. \u201cI\u2019ll carry it, don\u2019t you worry.\u201d</p>\n<p> They both know it\u2019s a lie. Geralt turns away with a sigh, already thinking of all the apologies he\u2019s going to owe Roach for the extra load. Jaskier drops his bundles by the door and slides onto Geralt\u2019s lap. Heavy hands fall on his hips as he tilts Geralt\u2019s chin, forcing the witcher to meet his eyes. \u201cI\u2019m <em>excited,</em>\u201d he breathes. </p>\n<p> The look on Geralt\u2019s face isn\u2019t quite a smile, but a light flares to life behind his eyes that wasn\u2019t there before. \u201cAs am I.\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cI\u2019ll finally get to see you without all the armor.\u201d</p>\n<p> Geralt quirks an eyebrow. \u201cYou see me without it every night.\u201d</p>\n<p> Jaskier shifts forward, putting more weight on Geralt as he leans in to kiss along his jaw. \u201cYes, but the light during the day is so much better. Besides, I can hardly imagine you going more than a few hours without strapping it on and swinging your sword at something.\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cThere will be sparring matches. We have to stay in shape.\u201d</p>\n<p> A wicked smile settles on Jaskier\u2019s lips. \u201cWhich will be a <em>delight</em> to watch, I assure you.\u201d He worms his way out of Geralt\u2019s arms and taunts him forward, standing just out of reach until Geralt heaves himself off the floor and follows Jaskier to bed. \u201cI want to see you relaxed, love. Nothing to kill. Nothing trying to kill you. Just us, and your brothers, and an entire winter to do nothing but make love and drink wine.\u201d He rolls over onto Geralt\u2019s stomach, settling himself there without fear. Geralt can take his weight. \u201cCan you imagine it?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u2026</p>\n<p>Geralt can imagine it. He has imagined nothing else since autumn.</p>\n<p>\u2026</p>\n<p>The day dawns cold and bright. Eskel and Lambert rise soon after the sun, cooking breakfast with sleep-mussed hair before setting about their daily tasks. True winter will be upon them soon- the kind that blocks mountain passes and freezes men to death, if they are stupid enough to be caught in it.</p>\n<p> Eskel spends the morning polishing his already spotless weapons while Lambert organizes their food stores for the second time that week. Vesemir spends it watching them both, his gaze settling on the gates as often as theirs. Their expectation is contagious, it seems, though he has no clue what they are expecting. </p>\n<p> Lunch is a quiet affair. Vesemir whiles away the afternoon with a book as Lambert and Eskel spar in the courtyard. They listen to the crash of steel on steel, the grunts of exertion when one of them lands a good hit. Wind whistles through the castle, high and reedy, heralding a storm to come. And underneath it all, barely loud enough for Lambert to hear above his breath, comes the chime of a lute. </p>\n<p> Eskel drops his sword. Lambert twists aside, sending his weapon crashing into the dirt instead of his brother\u2019s head. They freeze. Enhanced hearing is stretched to its limit as both men focus on the light, sweet sound of strings being plucked a few hundred meters away. Their eyes meet and then they\u2019re running, sprinting, nearly tripping over themselves as they bolt to the front of the castle. </p>\n<p> Lambert rounds the corner first, Eskel a beat behind him. Across the courtyard, Geralt swings off his horse and says something to the man at his side. Jaskier turns, as if in slow motion, and a smile splits his face as he shouts, \u201cLambert! Eskel!\u201d</p>\n<p> He drops his lute to the side just in time. Then his arms are full as Lambert pulls him into a bone-crushing hug, sweeping him off his feet and spinning him around like he\u2019s weightless. Jaskier gasps, but his feet are back on the ground before the shock can truly register and he\u2019s laughing, turning his face to the sky as Lambert mumbles his name. </p>\n<p> Lambert pulls away a second later, replaced by Eskel. Jaskier receives him warmly, threading his fingers through Eskel\u2019s hair as the witcher buries his face in Jaskier\u2019s neck. \u201c\u2019S good to see you,\u201d Eskel says, and a hot rush of joy runs down his spine as Jaskier\u2019s arms tighten around him. </p>\n<p> \u201cIt\u2019s good to see you, too.\u201d</p>\n<p> They greet Geralt as well, with claps on the back and easy smiles, falling into the rhythm of being together as if it hasn\u2019t been a year since they saw each other. Geralt leads Roach to the stables and Lambert sweeps Jaskier off his feet again, carrying him like something delicate and setting him before the fire that rages in the main hall. Jaskier sheds his layers off, stiff from hiking in the cold, and reaches out for Lambert, settling in his lap with a sigh of contentment. </p>\n<p> \u201cYou witchers know how to hide a fortress. I was worried we\u2019d freeze on the way up here and no one would find our bodies until spring.\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cI was almost concerned,\u201d Eskel says, dropping down next to them, \u201cbut Geralt knows we\u2019d kill him if the two of you showed up late.\u201d</p>\n<p> Jaskier laughs. He reaches out to brush back a lock of Eskel\u2019s hair. There\u2019s no practical need for the gesture. Eskel can only assume that Jaskier does it because he <em>wants</em> to, and no matter how many beds they share, that knowledge will never grow old.</p>\n<p>\u2026</p>\n<p>Geralt watches them from the threshold. His bard and his brothers, curled up around the fire. Touching and chatting like old friends. He was worried, in the dark parts of his heart, that this winter together would bring out an ugly side of himself. The part that acts like a wounded animal, snarling and thrashing to keep dangerous hands away from the one bright spark in his life.</p>\n<p> In the early days, he was constantly, achingly terrified that something would pull Jaskier away from him. A beautiful woman in a tavern, perhaps, or some young nobleman with table manners and clear, unscarred skin. Surely the excitement of adventure would wear off eventually. Jaskier would get sick of the growling and gore- his songs would be written, his fame assured, and he would melt away in the night like a mirage, leaving Geralt to walk the Path alone. </p>\n<p> He knows better now. Knows that Jaskier sees something in <em>Geralt</em>- not just the adventure, not just the road. His bard stays by his side out of the same love and devotion that sears Geralt\u2019s veins like a potion- sweet and painful and present. Always a hairsbreadth away. </p>\n<p> Eskel and Lambert are\u2026 brighter than Geralt. In so many ways. They laugh easier, smile easier. The fact that they took Geralt\u2019s offer and worked up the nerve to approach Jaskier on their own hints at a confidence that Geralt never possessed. Not with something like this. Monsters, he can handle, and idiotic villagers, too. But matters of the heart? Of yearning and touch? Of vulnerability? Jaskier taught him those. </p>\n<p> As excited as he was for the winter with his brothers, apprehension still controlled him. That old fear reared its head to whisper all the ways in which he is not enough- not enough for Jaskier, not enough for love, not enough to stand up to the fire that is his brothers. Jaskier spending time with them when Geralt was elsewhere was one thing, but he thought he would fade away like so much dust when placed directly next to them. </p>\n<p> He was wrong. </p>\n<p> Jaskier settles back into Lambert like he has always been there, reaches out to touch Eskel without a glimmer of uncertainty. He fits here. Even with his impractical clothes and his sappy poetry, somehow Jaskier fits right in amongst the witchers in their hall on the mountain. The old fear shrivels up as Geralt watches them. It dies a bloody death. His bard and his brothers are together. Geralt is <em>whole.</em></p>\n<p> The low tinge of cardamom reaches Geralt\u2019s nostrils. He turns to find Vesemir behind him, watching the scene unfold. They clasp hands- as affectionate as the old man gets. Across the hall, Jaskier launches into a story involving jilted lovers and quite a bit of liquor, and Lambert drapes his arms around him in a casual gesture of intimacy.</p>\n<p> \u201cIt seems I am the only one who has not met this bard of yours, Geralt.\u201d His words seem severe, but Vesemir\u2019s tone is light. A tiny bit bewildered, too. Geralt has had years to acclimate to Jaskier\u2019s casual affection and he\u2019s still shocked to see it in action. He can\u2019t imagine how Vesemir feels. </p>\n<p> \u201cYou can meet him now.\u201d</p>\n<p> Vesemir hums and steps into the hall, winter boots letting out a thud on the wood floor. The three men by the fire pause their conversation. Eskel\u2019s mouth is pressed in an uncertain line, and Lambert\u2019s grip on Jaskier loosens. Geralt understands their caution. Vesemir has never denied them care, or even love, but his expression of it comes in harsh words of criticism meant to save their lives in battle. He did not teach them vulnerability, or gentleness, yet here they are seeking it in the arms of a human. </p>\n<p> If Jaskier notices the sudden tension in the air, he doesn\u2019t let on. He shrugs out of Lambert\u2019s grip and walks to meet Vesemir in the middle of the hall, walk as cocky and flamboyant as ever. \u201cYou must be Vesemir,\u201d he says. </p>\n<p> \u201cYou are the bard who sings those songs about us.\u201d</p>\n<p> Jaskier winks, <em>winks</em>, and bows with a flourish. \u201cAt your service.\u201d</p>\n<p> Vesemir eyes him up and down like he\u2019s sizing up an opponent. Geralt knows that look. It cut him to the quick when he was young; always criticizing, always finding room for improvement. Jaskier bears it with grace. Finally, Vesemir meets Jaskier\u2019s eyes and inclines his head. It\u2019s slight enough that it would be easy to miss, but Geralt sees it, and from the widening of his brothers\u2019 eyes, he knows they do, too. </p>\n<p> \u201cI appreciate what you have done for the good name of our work,\u201d Vesemir says. Dry though it is, for Vesemir it\u2019s practically shouting praises from the rooftops. </p>\n<p> Jaskier, for his part, is vibrating out of his skin. \u201cThank you,\u201d he exclaims. Then his face sobers and he makes a clear effort get himself under control. He reaches out his hand for Vesemir to shake. \u201cIt is an honor to meet you at last.\u201d</p>\n<p> Vesemir takes the hand, unsuspecting, and Jaskier <em>tugs.</em> Not hard. Not enough to pull a human off his feet, and certainly not a witcher. But it sets Vesemir off balance enough that he takes a step forward and winds up with Jaskier\u2019s arms wrapped around him. </p>\n<p> It\u2019s the world\u2019s shortest hug- over before it really begins. Jaskier moves away a heartbeat later, dropping Vesemir\u2019s hand with a soft smile. He looks past Vesemir\u2019s shoulder at Geralt. \u201cHow\u2019s Roach? Not too crushed from all my \u2018extravagant\u2019 belongings, is she?\u201d </p>\n<p> \u201cShe\u2019s fine. But you owe her a good brushing.\u201d </p>\n<p> Geralt tries, and fails, not to watch Vesemir from the corner of his eye. His mentor has been stunned into silence. Geralt knows the feeling. He settles next to Eskel by the fire as Jaskier melts back into Lambert\u2019s arms. Hope for complete acceptance is unrealistic. It will take time for Vesemir to adjust to how <em>much</em> Jaskier can be. But the longer they talk- and the more Vesemir watches- something like understanding makes its home in Vesemir\u2019s eyes. For now, that's more than enough.</p>\n<p>\u2026</p>\n<p>They eat dinner around the fire. It\u2019s a type of deer stew that Jaskier has never tried before, but clearly <em>someone</em> at Kaer Morhen is a master chef, because it\u2019s delicious. Jaskier\u2019s money is on Vesemir.</p>\n<p> Geralt\u2019s mentor is not quite what Jaskier was expecting. He\u2019s tough and grizzled like the rest of the witchers, yes, but there\u2019s affection in his face that\u2019s plain enough to see. Vesemir cares for his students, cares that they\u2019re safe and well fed. Jaskier likes him already. </p>\n<p> Around midnight, when the long day of hiking has caught up to them, Jaskier and Geralt bid the others goodnight. Their room is upstairs. Simple, but spotless, and with a bed big enough to fit two, it looks like the perfect place to spend the winter. He and Geralt strip. They get in bed together, curled as close as they can get. Warm and secure, it is the safest they\u2019ve both been in months. </p>\n<p> Jaskier lies awake. </p>\n<p> He loves Geralt. Loves him with a fierce, burning passion that scares Jaskier with its intensity sometimes, and he does not want anything to come between them. Knows nothing ever could, not if he has a say in it. And yet\u2026</p>\n<p> It doesn\u2019t feel right to sleep beside Geralt alone when Lambert and Eskel are so close by. Jaskier has grown close with them over the past year. He knows the ache in their eyes, and he has taken great joy in relieving the pain however he can. That ache isn\u2019t gone, he\u2019s sure. They crave as much as they always have, but here, in the one place where they should feel most comfortable, neither man is willing to ask for that which they do not think themselves worthy of having. They defer to Geralt. Their fear tastes like ashes in Jaskier\u2019s mouth.</p>\n<p> \u201cYou aren\u2019t asleep.\u201d</p>\n<p> Jaskier doesn\u2019t need to turn to know how intently Geralt is staring at him. \u201cNeither are you.\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cHmmm.\u201d Jaskier thinks that will be the end of it, but Geralt\u2019s arm around him tightens and soft lips kiss behind his ear. \u201cThere is a room on the first floor with a larger bed,\u201d he mutters. \u201cLarge enough for four.\u201d</p>\n<p> Jaskier inhales sharply. \u201cGeralt, are you sure? I don\u2019t want you to feel like I\u2019m choosing- that I could <em>ever</em> choose <em>anyone</em> but you, because I love you so much, you must know-\u201c</p>\n<p> \u201cI know. I\u2019m sure.\u201d</p>\n<p> Covers rustle as Jaskier spins around to look into Geralt\u2019s eyes. Their gold glows like embers in the darkness, lit by the dim light of the moon. \u201cI love you,\u201d he breathes. </p>\n<p> Geralt smiles at him- a tender, open thing that makes Jaskier\u2019s insides melt. He brings their lips together in a lingering kiss before dropping his arms from Jaskier\u2019s waist and sitting up. \u201cEskel is the second door on the right. Lambert is third on the left. I\u2019ll meet you downstairs.\u201d</p>\n<p> Jaskier rolls out of bed and shimmies on a pair of pants. He leans in for one more kiss before he slides out the door and heads for Eskel\u2019s room. It only takes one knock for Eskel to open the door, still clothed and looking as miserable as Jaskier feels. </p>\n<p> \u201cThis is horrible,\u201d Jaskier says. </p>\n<p> Eskel can only nod. Jaskier takes that as assent, pulling him into a brief hug before moving away and grabbing one wrist to drag Eskel down the hall behind him. Lambert\u2019s door swings open before Jaskier can knock. His arms are filled with pillows and blankets, the bed behind him empty. \u201cIt is horrible,\u201d he agrees, and that settles it. </p>\n<p> They stumble downstairs, a mess of limbs and linens, and Eskel leads them to a massive room where Geralt has stoked a fire to life. There is indeed a bed big enough for four- more a pallet than a proper mattress- but with all the blankets Geralt has piled on it, it should serve just fine. They can figure out something better tomorrow. </p>\n<p> Lambert\u2019s eyes flick to Geralt, uncertain. \u201cAre you\u2026?\u201d</p>\n<p> A tense moment passes as Geralt works down what Jaskier is sure is shame. His discomfort is palpable, but not for the reason Lambert assumes. It\u2019s the conversation Geralt hates, not the action of sharing a bed. Finally, he grunts out, \u201cYes,\u201d and that\u2019s enough for Jaskier. </p>\n<p> He falls back onto the mound of pillows and covers. \u201cI, for one, am exhausted,\u201d he declares. He\u2019s still shirtless, because it\u2019s comfortable, dammit, and he wishes one of them would get a fucking clue and cuddle up. The room is cold, even with the fire. \u201cAre you coming?\u201d</p>\n<p> Eskel- sweet, bold Eskel- moves first. He tosses his shirt into a corner, followed quickly by his pants, and he spoons up behind Jaskier in nothing but his smallclothes. The tension in the air snaps. Dissolves. It melts away at Jaskier\u2019s sigh. Lambert joins them, his head cushioned on Jaskier\u2019s stomach, and Geralt falls into bed last, bracketing Jaskier from above; one arm slung across Jaskier\u2019s chest, the other in his hair. </p>\n<p> Jaskier is <em>overwhelmed</em> in the best way. Every part of him is warm, lit up by the witchers in his bed. Perhaps he should feel awkward, yet the only emotion in Jaskier\u2019s chest is contentment. He\u2019s safe. He\u2019s held. He has an entire winter ahead of him to enjoy this; to soak up as much affection as he can and return it in kind. Jaskier shuts his eyes and lets the gentle winds of sleep carry him away.</p>\n<p>Jaskier wakes to an empty bed. He pushes himself up and runs a hand down his face, glancing about the sunlit room. It\u2019s not a surprise to wake alone- witchers rarely sleep past dawn. Shaking sleep out of his limbs, he notices a pile of his clothes by the door. Simpler than his usual, just a cotton shirt and the pair of pants he keeps around for long winter nights on the road. Geralt must have dropped them off. </p>\n<p> He shrugs on the clothes and shuffles into the main hall. Vesemir is reading a book by the window. Geralt and his brothers are gathered around one of the tables with an obscene amount of food piled in front of them, arguing loudly about\u2026ghouls? He drops onto the bench next to Geralt as Eskel declares, \u201cThat is <em>not</em> how it happened.\u201d</p>\n<p> Jaskier picks a berry off of Geralt\u2019s plate and tosses it into his mouth, savoring what will likely be the last fresh fruit of the year. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cLambert is telling lies about a nest of ghouls we took out when we were younger.\u201d</p>\n<p> Lambert throws a chunk of bread at his brother\u2019s head. \u201cIt did take you an hour.\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cTwenty minutes,\u201d Eskel insists. \u201cAt most.\u201d</p>\n<p> Geralt drops an arm around Jaskier\u2019s shoulder, lips dragging against the shell of his ear as he rumbles, \u201cIt took an hour.\u201d</p>\n<p> He catches the fork that whizzes past his ear without looking, hands moving so fast that Jaskier can barely see them. \u201cFuck you,\u201d Eskel spits. \u201cWe were in <em>training.\u201d</em></p>\n<p> \u201cAnd you were slow.\u201d</p>\n<p> Strong hands yank Jaskier away as Eskel leaps the table and tackles Geralt to the ground, cursing. \u201cLet us talk, bard,\u201d Vesemir says from behind him. \u201cThey need to work off some energy without breakable humans around.\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cThey wouldn\u2019t hurt me,\u201d Jaskier argues, but he lets himself be led away all the same. Crashes and shouts echo from the dining hall as Vesemir brings him outside. A fire is blazing one of the pits, two plates of food set out next to it. This meeting was planned. Calculated. </p>\n<p> \u201cSit,\u201d Vesemir says, and Jaskier does. A hawk screeches in the distance, its cry rolling down the mountainside like thunder. Silence settles over their fire. Jaskier eats. Vesemir watches. Years ago, the quiet would have prompted Jaskier to speak, to say something to fill the air. He knows this game now. It is the game of silence Geralt has always played, and here sits the man who taught it to him. Jaskier can wait. </p>\n<p> The question, when it comes, is unexpected. \u201cAre you a lover to all three of them?\u201d </p>\n<p> \u201cNo. Only Geralt.\u201d</p>\n<p> Vesemir nods as though Jaskier has confirmed something he already knew. \u201cHe cares for you a great deal.\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cI know.\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cDo you, bard?\u201d Harsh eyes rake over Jaskier\u2019s body; soft where witchers are hard, weak where witchers are strong. \u201cDo you know what it means to hold the heart of not one of us, but three? You could wreak destruction on this mountain with a few well-placed words, and no amount of silver or steel could stop you.\u201d</p>\n<p> Jaskier thinks of Eskel\u2019s terror after he killed the bruxa. Thinks of Lambert, eyes black and skin bloody at Jaskier\u2019s feet. Of Geralt, and how many of his scars are from protecting Jaskier, from placing his body between Jaskier and a monster, uncaring how his own skin is marred so long as Jaskier\u2019s is clean. </p>\n<p> \u201cI could,\u201d he agrees, because it is true. \u201cI won\u2019t.\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cNo one seeks a witcher\u2019s love.\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cYet here I sit.\u201d Jaskier meets Vesemir\u2019s gaze. He does not flinch. He does not look away. \u201cWhat say you to that?\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cI say you must have another reason. Information for those songs of yours. A notch in your belt.\u201d </p>\n<p> Jaskier itches to shout that Geralt is not a <em>notch in his belt.</em> If he were, Jaskier wouldn\u2019t be here. He would be a million miles away, bragging, not staring down the closest thing Geralt has to a father on the side of a freezing fucking mountain. But he knows that shouts, screams of indignation, are not the way to go here. Jaskier needs Vesemir to understand, and understanding takes words. Calm. He steadies his voice and tilts his head to the sky, letting the winter sun warm his face. </p>\n<p> \u201cHave you known joy, Vesemir?\u201d </p>\n<p> The hawk screeches again. Its cry fills the silence where Vesemir\u2019s voice does not. </p>\n<p> Jaskier presses on. \u201cUp here, in these lonely halls, have you known joy?\u201d He drops his eyes from the sky and settles them on Vesemir\u2019s face, his expression unreadable. \u201cI have,\u201d he says softly. \u201cI have known joy so strong it stole the breath from my lungs.\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cYou have a poet\u2019s heart.\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cI have a fool\u2019s heart,\u201d Jaskier snaps. The words come out harsh, and that is how he meant them. Like a dagger to the throat. \u201cMy fool\u2019s heart has been dragged across the coals more times than I can count, witcher. I never learn. I hand it over to every lover who graces my bed, hoping that maybe this time, <em>this time</em>, will be the one that they do not tear it to pieces.\u201d </p>\n<p> He shakes his head, kicking at a piece of wood in the fire. The mountain air burns as he breathes it in. \u201cI cut my heart out and dropped it at Geralt\u2019s feet the day I met him. Bloody and raw, like everything else he deals with. It would have been easy- so <em>easy</em> for him to tear me apart.\u201d Jaskier snaps his head back up. He wants Vesemir to see the fire in his eyes. \u201cI expected him to, you know. I saw those huge swords and that frown he always wears, and I figured, why not? If I\u2019m going to die of heartbreak, why not let a witcher do the breaking? It\u2019d make for a great ballad.\u201d</p>\n<p> A wry smile flits across Jaskier\u2019s face. \u201cNo one had ever done that, I don\u2019t think- bared themselves so easily to him. And what did he do?\u201d Jaskier turns his hands to the open air in a gesture of amazement. Incredulity seeps into his voice. \u201cHe <em>protected</em> me. He saved me from a bunch of elves, and a griffin after that, and more drowners than I can remember, and a million other monsters that would have had me. Some of them human.\u201d Jaskier heaves in a long breath to steady himself. \u201cI have known joy in Geralt\u2019s arms. Lambert\u2019s and Eskel\u2019s, too. I am here for that, for <em>them</em>, because they wanted me to come. Nothing more.\u201d</p>\n<p> Jaskier stands. He shudders despite the chill of the fire, feeling drained. He picks up his plate, empty now. He turns to Vesemir, the man\u2019s face a wall of stone. \u201cThank you for the food,\u201d he says quietly, and leaves.</p>\n<p>\u2026</p>\n<p>Vesemir disappears after breakfast. Eskel isn\u2019t sure where he went, or why Jaskier returned to the hall looking so rattled, but he knows Vesemir will return for dinner. He never could stay away from a decent meal.</p>\n<p> Their group is gathered around the table once more, mugs of ale in front of them. Eskel is still licking his wounds from the morning\u2019s fight, which Geralt only won because he was <em>distracted</em>, damn him, and Lambert is in the corner sharpening a sword. He decided that today was the day he would hone every sword in the armory. The low rasp of whetstone on steel ripples through the air like a song. </p>\n<p> Eskel has just begun a story about a siren he came across in Redania when Jaskier bolts upright from where he was slouching against Geralt. \u201cThat reminds me-\u201c He scrambles out of his seat and moves toward the doors, shouting, \u201cOne second,\u201d as he disappears around the corner. </p>\n<p> Flashes from last night creep into Eskel\u2019s mind as he watches him go. Sitting on the edge of his bed. Begging sleep to take him and knowing it won\u2019t. The smell of sunshine drifting from Geralt\u2019s room, reminding Eskel of all he wants but does not have the right to ask for. Jaskier was Geralt\u2019s first. No amount of yearning, no amount of misery or gritted teeth from Eskel would change that. </p>\n<p> He thought he could bear it. He had before, for decades. But that was before he knew what touch could be. What <em>intimacy</em> could be. That was before Jaskier wormed his way into Eskel\u2019s bedroll and seared a brand onto his heart with soft words and scorching hands. Alone in his room, cold despite the fire, Eskel could feel the pull, feel the <em>ache</em> to go to Jaskier, but he knew he couldn\u2019t. He couldn\u2019t. And then\u2026 </p>\n<p> Jaskier bursts into the hall, bringing with him a gust of cold air and an armload of stuff. He flops down next to Geralt again, allowing two of the bags he carries to clatter against the table but setting down the last item carefully. Jaskier grins and pushes it across the table to Eskel. </p>\n<p> It\u2019s a black, curved container with two brass clasps on one side. Eskel recognizes it instantly. \"Why?\" he asks, the question a pale echo of the first time he asked Jaskier why, in a room so far away from here.</p>\n<p> \u201cIt\u2019s for you.\u201d Jaskier waves a hand at him impatiently. \u201cGo on, open it.\u201d</p>\n<p> Eskel flicks the clasps open and lifts the lid. Inside is a lute. He picks it up slowly, gingerly, as if it\u2019s an animal he might startle away. The instrument is a simple dark blue, its lines clean and without ornament- with a wide neck and strings spaced far enough apart for him to fit his fingers over them easily. It\u2019s slightly larger than the average lute, as if it were crafted specifically to be played by a larger man.</p>\n<p> In the stunned silence that follows, Lambert speaks up. \u201cI didn\u2019t know you played.\u201d</p>\n<p> Eskel turns the lute over in his hands with wonder. \u201cI don\u2019t, much,\u201d he says, \u201cbut-\u201c</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>But</em>,\u201d Jaskier interjects, \u201cyou have all winter to pick it up again. And you\u2019re just lucky enough to be stuck on the side of a mountain with the single best lute player on the <em>continent</em>, so I\u2019m certain you\u2019ll be a master in no time.\u201d</p>\n<p> Words crowd up his throat, twisting into a ball that makes it hard to breathe, much less speak. It has been so long since someone gave Eskel a gift like this. A gift that isn\u2019t a weapon or a piece of armor. It\u2019s frivolous, and a little bit silly, and Eskel decides in that moment that he will spend every day playing the damn thing if it makes Jaskier smile like he is right now.</p>\n<p> \u201cThank you,\u201d he says gruffly. He means to say much more than that, but the words won\u2019t come out. From the glow in Jaskier\u2019s eyes, Eskel knows he understands. </p>\n<p> \u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d</p>\n<p> Jaskier unloads the other bags with enthusiasm. There is a stack of books in Elvish for Lambert. A jacket for Geralt with tiny hints of embroidery the same silver as his hair. Oils in non-offensive smells for baths in the hot spring, and a pile of sweets that Eskel is sure are there for Jaskier\u2019s own tastes instead of any sort of altruism. </p>\n<p> Geralt smirks a little when he sees the sweets. \u201cI told you we have food here.\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cLook me in the eyes, Geralt, and tell me the witchers of Kaer Morhen have a stockpile of expensive, nutritionless candy lying around somewhere.\u201d When no such assurance is forthcoming, Jaskier scoffs. \u201cThat\u2019s what I thought.\u201d</p>\n<p> With everything distributed, the only item that remains on the table is a small satin bag. Jaskier tugs it open cautiously, and the sharp scent of nervousness works its way into the air. </p>\n<p> \u201cI wasn\u2019t sure if- well, I\u2019m still not sure, and obviously I don\u2019t have any <em>expectations</em> or anything ridiculous like that, but-\u201c Jaskier tips the contents of the bag into his hand and closes his fist, shutting his eyes as he centers himself. \u201cI thought it would be convenient if we had some way to communicate. Besides the mages\u2019 notes, which I have noticed, thank you, because none of you idiots are all that subtle about sending them.\u201d</p>\n<p> Eskel feels a little abashed. He and the others did send notes whenever one of them left Jaskier- mostly to make sure he wouldn\u2019t be left unprotected for long. It must have been too much to ask that Jaskier not catch on. He\u2019s remarkably observant under all the jokes and silk doublets. </p>\n<p> \u201cAnyway,\u201d Jaskier continues, \u201cI hope I\u2019m not being too presumptuous. And I promise not to be too annoying, or anything-\u201c</p>\n<p> \u201cJaskier,\u201d Eskel says. \u201cJust show us.\u201d</p>\n<p> He nods sharply. \u201cRight, sure. Fine.\u201d Jaskier\u2019s fist opens to reveal a tangle of chains and flashing metal. They ring like bells as he drops them on the table, sorting through the pile before pushing a single chain towards each witcher. </p>\n<p> Eskel picks his up to turn it over in the firelight. The links are simple, yet sturdy. From the chain hangs a pendant crafted to look like a bird in flight. Magic radiates from the bird in waves. </p>\n<p> \u201cThese are <em>powerful</em>, Jaskier.\u201d Lambert\u2019s voice is awed. \u201cWhat do they do?\u201d</p>\n<p> <em>If the mage I got them from can be believed, they will allow us to speak even if we aren\u2019t together. Across any distance, she said.</em></p>\n<p> It\u2019s Jaskier\u2019s voice, but the words aren\u2019t spoken aloud. They\u2019re in Eskel\u2019s mind- carried through the pendant in Jaskier\u2019s hand to the one in Eskel\u2019s, echoing through him like a physical presence. The witchers turn to their bard in shock.</p>\n<p> \u201cLike I said, none of you have to use them\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p> Eskel tunes out Jaskier\u2019s nervous rambling, choosing instead to drop the chain over his head and settle the swooping bird next to the wolf pendant that sits over his heart. Next to him, his brothers do the same. The cold metal warms quickly against his skin. </p>\n<p> <em>I like it,</em> he thinks. The message must go through, because Jaskier shuts his mouth with a plop and shoots Eskel a tentative smile. </p>\n<p> \u201cClever,\u201d Geralt murmurs. Lambert nods his agreement, looking overwhelmed. </p>\n<p> Eskel raises a hand to touch the bird through his shirt. Jaskier\u2019s gift is practical, yes, but it is more than that. It\u2019s a claim. The chains around their necks are a declaration of loyalty- not just the witchers\u2019, but Jaskier\u2019s too, their twin pendants a wordless announcement that they are bound together by <em>choice.</em> Across any distance.</p>\n<p> At this time last winter, Eskel would have laughed off any man stupid enough to believe that a human would willingly bind themselves to a group of witchers. The very thought would have been ridiculous. Now, though, he watches Jaskier tease his brothers, making jokes and hurling insults down the magic that connects them, and his uncertainty crumbles to dust. Jaskier chose them. They chose him in return. </p>\n<p> Lambert drags two proper mattresses into the room they\u2019ve commandeered, replacing the old pallet with something more comfortable. The awkwardness from the previous night is gone. Sighs of contentment replace it as they settle down to sleep, limbs tangled together beneath thick wool blankets. Moonlight glints on the steel at their throats; three wolves with their bard tucked safely between them.</p>\n<p>Their days fall into a rhythm. The witchers rise at dawn to train- sparring and reviewing techniques under Vesemir\u2019s expert eye. Jaskier joins them for a late breakfast and teaches Eskel lute for a while, the two of them sitting knee to knee as Jaskier demonstrates chords and Eskel does his best to follow along. They never manage to focus for long before Lambert distracts them with something from his endless repertoire of <em>filthy</em> sea shanties. </p>\n<p> The afternoons vary. Jaskier often excuses himself to go work on songs. There is a large window on one of the upper floors with a just wide enough for a bard and his lute. He likes to sit there as he composes, looking past the glass to the mountain below. </p>\n<p> Geralt finds him there some days, sweaty from sparring, his skin glowing in the afternoon light. Jaskier loves when he gets like that- unrestrained and wanting. The gleam in his yellow eyes spells trouble of the most delicious kind and, well, it\u2019s no coincidence that Jaskier\u2019s window of choice isn\u2019t far from their bedroom. </p>\n<p> Evenings are for dinner and alcohol. Witchers can\u2019t really get drunk, at least not on wine and ale, so Jaskier does his best to pace himself. It wouldn\u2019t do to be drunk when all his friends begin to spill their stories. </p>\n<p> Oh, the stories they tell. Most are exciting. They\u2019re tales of monsters and maidens- Jaskier\u2019s bread and butter. Vesemir, he is delighted to learn, is the best storyteller of them all. Not only has he seen nearly everything, but he also does not hesitate to add details or embellish with description where Geralt and his brothers tend to be tighter lipped. Things between Jaskier and Vesemir are strained outside of these quiet evenings. He learns to see the stories as gifts. Not quite an olive branch, not yet, but more than Jaskier expected so soon. </p>\n<p> Other nights are heavier. The witchers speak of lost comrades. Monsters slain a few moments too late. Potions that burn like fire in their veins. Innkeeps and aldermen whose faces turn hard at the sight of steel and silver swords. Jaskier knows that nothing he says can fix these things. That no matter how long he travels with Geralt, no matter how much he witnesses, it will never truly be the same for him. On these nights, all Jaskier can do is raise his glass with the others and <em>listen.</em></p>\n<p> And if Jaskier holds them tighter than usual? If he curls up like he wants to disappear under their skin and touches like he wants to give all he is to these men who have already given themselves to the world?</p>\n<p> If he does those things, his bedmates never mention it. </p>\n<p> They only settle closer.</p>\n<p>\u2026</p>\n<p>Vesemir\u2019s wooden practice sword slams against Geralt\u2019s knee, sending him sprawling. The sword is leveled at his throat an instant later, announcing the end of their third sparring match of the morning. Geralt nods in defeat and rights himself.</p>\n<p> The day has not yet dawned. His brothers are still in bed with Jaskier, but Vesemir had caught Geralt\u2019s eye during dinner the previous night, a silent order to rise before the others did. There is a conversation to be had, and now, circling each other as their fourth match begins, Geralt knows the time has come. </p>\n<p> \u201cYou reek of magic.\u201d</p>\n<p> Geralt tugs at the chain around his neck in answer, flicking the metal songbird free from his shirt. Vesemir\u2019s eyes narrow at the sight of it. He lunges. It\u2019s a testing move, and one that Geralt blocks easily, but the force of his blow is stronger than any from their first three matches. </p>\n<p> Vesemir returns to his side of the sparring ring. Neither man wears shoes, nor armor. They are bare and vulnerable in the darkness before dawn. Two warriors, facing each other unprotected. The blows that land will leave bruises in their wake. </p>\n<p> Three quick steps and a feint take Geralt to Vesemir\u2019s side. His blow is blocked with the clack of wood on wood. He spins away to avoid a counter strike and Vesemir follows him, sword lashing out in a move too fast for the human eye to follow. Geralt deflects it with a flick of his wrist. </p>\n<p> \u201cHe has shackled you,\u201d Vesemir spits. Geralt ducks his next swing and jabs with his own weapon, unsurprised when the blow does not land. </p>\n<p> \u201cHe has marked what belongs to him. I welcome it.\u201d</p>\n<p> A hollow sound rings out as their swords meet again. Vesemir pulls back and swings a split second before Geralt. His blunted weapon grazes Geralt\u2019s thigh as he darts away. \u201cWe belong to the Path,\u201d he admonishes. \u201cTo silver and steel. To the hunt.\u201d Vesemir is a blur as he charges, executing a complex pattern of footwork that sets Geralt on the defensive. Their breaths come fast. \u201cYou do not belong in the arms of a human.\u201d</p>\n<p> Geralt snarls and launches off his back foot. He sweeps his sword in an arc towards Vesemir\u2019s throat that the older witcher barely manages to block. Their weapons creak from strain. \u201cDo not tell me where I belong.\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cWe live on the Path. Your bard will make you slow. He will get you killed.\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cWe <em>survive</em> on the Path,\u201d Geralt corrects. \u201cWe do precious little <em>living.\u201d</em> He attacks again, this time striking Vesemir\u2019s shoulder hard enough to bruise. \u201cAnd I have not slowed. Not after fourteen years.\u201d</p>\n<p> Shock causes Vesemir to falter. His sword drops slightly and Geralt presses his advantage, sliding his weapon past his mentor\u2019s defenses and knocking the air from his lungs. With real swords, it would be a killing blow. </p>\n<p> \u201cFourteen years?\u201d Vesemir demands. He shuffles backward to put some distance between them. \u201cYou\u2019ve been traveling with this bard for <em>fourteen years?\u201d</em> Incredulity colors his voice. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p>\n<p> Geralt watches him with a cautious eye. His weapon may have lowered, but the fight is not yet over. \u201cYou raised us to fight. Taught us to kill.\u201d Geralt swings his sword in a circle, handling it with confidence born of endless practice. Even after all this time, his fingers are more comfortable on a sword hilt than trailing over Jaskier\u2019s skin. More practiced with violence than tenderness. \u201cSlaughtering monsters for coin until the locals drive us out, too afraid to look a witcher in the eye. Is that the life you would choose for us?\u201d He spits on the ground between them, rage like black blood in his veins. \u201cIt\u2019s fucking <em>miserable.\u201d</em></p>\n<p> \u201cIt\u2019s all we have,\u201d Vesemir says. The sword at his side is all but forgotten. </p>\n<p> \u201cIt doesn\u2019t need to be.\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cYou want more.\u201d An accusation. Horror in his tone, as though happiness is something to fear. And perhaps, after so long with only anger and loneliness, it is. </p>\n<p> Geralt touches the pendant on his chest. Frigid air tugs at his skin, but he is warm with memories of Jaskier\u2019s arms around him. \u201cI have more.\u201d</p>\n<p> The weapon slides from Vesemir\u2019s hands. It clatters on the cobblestones at his feet. \u201cFourteen years, and still you choose him?\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cEvery day.\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cHe <em>will</em> put you in danger someday, Geralt. What happens when the choice is your bard or your life?\u201d</p>\n<p> Geralt looks past his mentor to where yellow streaks the horizon, summoning forth the day. He has thought of this possibility more times than he can count. In the early days, perhaps it was a question. Now the answer is a foregone conclusion, as constant and certain as the dawn that creeps over the mountain. </p>\n<p> \u201cThen I die.\u201d Geralt throws down his sword and meets Vesemir\u2019s glare with one of his own. \u201cAnd he lives. It is no choice. Not for me.\u201d</p>\n<p> Vesemir takes him in. The certainty in his posture and the life in his limbs, battle hardened and strong. No slower than he was in decades past. No weaker for his vulnerability, or for his desires. Geralt is every inch the warrior his mentor shaped, but his face no longer bears the silver lines of endurance, scars from a life of violence and rejection. Those lines were worn away by tender fingertips; lips and hands trailing along the broken parts of Geralt until he melted and reformed beneath them. </p>\n<p> Laughter echoes to them from the castle- the sound of his brothers waking. Vesemir\u2019s gaze does not waver. He nods, just once. </p>\n<p> Geralt has said his piece, stunted though his words were. Vesemir will take them or not, but Geralt knows a change has begun. He can see it stirring in Vesemir\u2019s eyes.</p>\n<p> The rest is up to Jaskier.</p>\n<p>\u2026</p>\n<p>Hunger drives Jaskier from his windowsill. Dinner is a few hours away, so he shuffles down to the kitchen in search of food. Vesemir is there when he arrives, looking strangely unguarded in the firelight.</p>\n<p> \u201cSorry,\u201d Jaskier says. \u201cI didn\u2019t know you were in here. I came down for a snack, but I can-\u201c He makes for the door, ready to bolt before a gruff voice stops him. </p>\n<p> \u201cStay.\u201d </p>\n<p> Jaskier stays. He grabs a hunk of bread and sits down to watch Vesemir cook. There\u2019s a mound of vegetables on the counter, enough to feed a small army. Or four witchers, Jaskier thinks. Vesemir slides him a block of wood and a knife. \u201cI\u2019m assuming you know how to cook?\u201d</p>\n<p> He nods enthusiastically. \u201cNothing fancy, but I can chop potatoes.\u201d</p>\n<p> Vesemir grunts and returns to his own work. His knife beats out a constant rhythm. Three cuts one way, three the other, and a slide as he scrapes the chunks of vegetable into a nearby pot. Jaskier does his best to match the pace, standing at the counter in silence. Vesemir looks at him from time to time. His eyes burn on Jaskier\u2019s skin, but he keeps his own gaze focused downward. That\u2019s another trick he learned from Geralt- let the witcher come to you. It doesn\u2019t take long. </p>\n<p> \u201cCooking.\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cI, um- what?\u201d Jaskier sputters. </p>\n<p> \u201cCooking brings me joy.\u201d Vesemir pauses in his chopping to meet Jaskier\u2019s eyes. \u201cAnd having them here.\u201d He gestures vaguely behind them at the main hall where Geralt and his brothers are entrenched in a game of Gwent. \u201cKnowing they\u2019re\u2026safe. At least for the winter.\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cOh.\u201d Jaskier\u2019s stomach goes warm and soupy at the admission. He recognizes the peace offering for what it is, and he can\u2019t keep the smile off his face. \u201cI like knowing they\u2019re safe, too. I <em>need</em> to know they\u2019re safe, actually. It\u2019s kind of hard to breathe if they aren\u2019t.\u201d He lets out a soft, pained laugh. \u201cI\u2019ve seen Geralt covered in his own blood too many times, and Eskel with the noonwraith that one time, and Lambert got those scratches a few months ago-\u201c Jaskier sets down his knife and holds his hands down against the counter to keep them from shaking. </p>\n<p> \u201cThat is the life of a witcher,\u201d Vesemir says gently. </p>\n<p> \u201cI know. I know. I-\u201c He heaves in a breath. \u201cIt\u2019s good that they have this place. You. Winter is my favorite time of year, no matter how fucking cold it gets, because I know they\u2019ll be here, with you and each other. I trust you to watch their backs, even if I\u2019m not there.\u201d</p>\n<p> Vesemir snorts. \u201cAre you implying that <em>you</em> protect <em>them</em>, bard? I find that difficult to believe.\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cBelieve what you will,\u201d Jaskier says. \u201cIt\u2019s true regardless. I may not be a fighter, but I can be there when it\u2019s over. To make sure they eat and bathe like real people. To hold them together, if they need me to. And sometimes when they don\u2019t.\u201d He flashes Vesemir a smile and tries for a lighter tone. \u201cI\u2019m pretty decent with medicine by now, too.\u201d Brandishing his knife in a joking threat, Jaskier leans in and whispers, \u201cYou <em>cannot</em> tell Geralt this, but I actually studied medicine a little while he was here last winter. Told him I was playing in taverns down the mountain and shacked up with a healer instead. Lovely old lady, quite good at knitting. She talked my ear off about tinctures and salves and stitches and the like- I filled a whole notebook.\u201d </p>\n<p> He returns to chopping, humming as he goes, heedless of the new respect that shows on Vesemir\u2019s face. \u201cCame in handy with that sea monster thing in Skellige, let me tell you. I mean, I love the man, but he has <em>no</em> sense of self-preservation.\u201d</p>\n<p> Vesemir nods and grunts in the right places, letting Jaskier chatter away until dinner is ready. They\u2019re met with cheers when they march into the hall carrying a pot of stew. Lambert recalls all the ways Eskel cheated at Gwent, but seeing as no swords were drawn, Jaskier decides it can\u2019t have been that bad. He fills his bowl while they talk, and when he sits down to eat, Vesemir sits beside him.</p>\n<p>\u2026</p>\n<p>Lambert sighs and leans back until his shoulders sink beneath the water. This time last year, he was scheming to convince Geralt to speak about his bard. Now that bard is next to him in the hot spring, smelling of sweet contentment. He wants to bury his nose in it.</p>\n<p> Heat winds its way through his body. A slow spread of realization. He <em>can</em> bury his nose in that smell, if he wants. </p>\n<p> Water ripples around him as he slides to Jaskier\u2019s side. Slender hands are working soap into his hair, but he drops them immediately when Lambert reaches out for him. Lambert tucks his face into the crook of Jaskier\u2019s neck, inhaling. Arms come up to hold him, warm even in the heat of the water, amusement clear in Jaskier\u2019s touch. </p>\n<p> \u201cWhat do I smell like?\u201d </p>\n<p> \u201cSunshine,\u201d he answers honestly. \u201cAnd honey. It\u2019s nice.\u201d</p>\n<p> Jaskier lets out a chuckle that Lambert can feel in his chest. \u201cThat\u2019s good. I haven\u2019t been covered in anything worse than sweat recently, but I figured using the oils couldn\u2019t hurt.\u201d </p>\n<p> Lambert shakes his head. \u201cNot the oils. Just you.\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cOh.\u201d Jaskier falls silent, but the smells of contentment spike in Lambert\u2019s nose. What he did to deserve this he doesn\u2019t know. There is little room for tenderness in a witcher\u2019s life. Geralt should have scared Jaskier off years ago. And yet. Here they are. </p>\n<p> \u201cLet me,\u201d he mumbles, lips dragging against wet skin. Jaskier hums in question and Lambert pulls away to tug on a strand of his half washed hair. \u201cYou always do mine.\u201d</p>\n<p> The smile on Jaskier\u2019s face is languid. Pleased. It settles deep in Lambert\u2019s bones like a brand. \u201cAlright,\u201d he says, voice pitched low and soft to match the water around them. </p>\n<p> Lambert leans against the wall of the hot spring and tugs Jaskier against his chest. He finishes the lather Jaskier had started, taking care not to let any soap drip into his eyes. Jaskier dunks to rid his head of the soap and Lambert reaches for a vial of oil from his pack. Lavender. Jaskier never said it was his favorite, but it\u2019s the one he replenishes most often, so Lambert figures it a safe bet. From the happy surprise in Jaskier\u2019s eyes, he figured right. </p>\n<p> He tips the oil into his palm and threads his fingers through Jaskier\u2019s hair. He\u2019s never done this for someone before. Lambert used to worry that it was work for Jaskier to help him bathe, unpleasant somehow to wash dirt away from another person\u2019s skin. But with Jaskier pliant and relaxed beneath his hands, Lambert begins to understand. It is not a hardship to take care of someone he loves. </p>\n<p> His hands still. <em>Someone he loves.</em> Lambert never thought he would have cause to think that phrase. He loves his brothers, of course, but it is a hard, battle-worn love. They do not speak of it aloud. This love, for Jaskier, is different. It\u2019s no more sexual than what he feels for Geralt and Eskel, but it is <em>raw.</em> Jaskier has cut his heart from his chest with a knife so smooth and gentle that Lambert did not notice its sting until he began to bleed. </p>\n<p> \u201cLambert? What\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p>\n<p> Emotion rises in him like the tide. Steady, and strong. Powerful enough to drown an empire. He shakes with the force of it. </p>\n<p> \u201cLambert?\u201d Jaskier tries to turn, but Lambert holds him still. He slides a hand up Jaskier\u2019s side and settles it against his chest to feel the heartbeat there. </p>\n<p> \u201cI love you,\u201d he whispers. Once the words are brought to light, there is no revoking them. He lays them at Jaskier\u2019s feet as uncertainty crashes over his head, threatening to pull him under. \u201cIs that alright?\u201d</p>\n<p> Now Jaskier does turn, Lambert\u2019s arms not enough to hold him back. He brings his hands up to cradle Lambert\u2019s face and presses their foreheads together. It\u2019s a small mercy. If Lambert had to look him in the eyes right now, he thinks he would break apart.</p>\n<p> \u201cOf course it\u2019s alright,\u201d Jaskier whispers. There is pain in his voice and Lambert <em>hates</em> it. Hates that his own emotional ineptitude is what put it there. \u201cOf course it\u2019s alright, Lambert,\u201d he repeats. \u201cIt\u2019s more than alright.\u201d Jaskier\u2019s shoulder blades move beneath Lambert\u2019s hands as he drags his palms down Lambert\u2019s neck, catching on the chain that hangs there. He has not taken it off since the night Jaskier gave it to him. \u201cI love you too, you silly witcher. More than my own blood.\u201d</p>\n<p> He can feel the truth of it. Jaskier\u2019s love is a wave as strong as Lambert\u2019s, crashing against his own and leaving calmer waters in its wake. </p>\n<p> They stay close for the rest of the night. Jaskier keeps a hand on his knee at dinner, as if he can sense how close Lambert is to crumbling. One sharp tap is all it would take to make him fall, but Jaskier stands in front of him, holding the weight of the world as Lambert pieces himself back together. </p>\n<p> Geralt seems to understand. He catches Lambert\u2019s eye over dinner and nods to where Jaskier is touching him. There is no judgment in the look. Lambert may love Jaskier differently than Geralt does, but the vulnerability is the same. Geralt has felt the sweet kiss of Jaskier\u2019s blade. He has allowed it to remake him. </p>\n<p> Lambert doesn\u2019t understand what he did to deserve this love. But as the tide rises with each familiar swipe of Jaskier\u2019s fingers over his skin, he knows one thing. </p>\n<p> He will burn the world to protect it.</p>\n<p>Geralt\u2019s world comes crashing down at lunch. It ends in five words, spoken by Eskel\u2019s low voice. Jaskier is in the kitchen with Vesemir. Geralt isn\u2019t sure what he\u2019d missed, but the two of them cook together nearly every meal now. Five words. That\u2019s all it takes.</p>\n<p> \u201cHe\u2019s going to die someday.\u201d</p>\n<p> Lambert\u2019s fork clatters against his plate. \u201cShut up, Eskel.\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cBut he will.\u201d Eskel is sitting on the floor, watching the fire. He\u2019s stiff as a board. \u201cUs not talking about it won\u2019t stop that. He\u2019ll die either way.\u201d</p>\n<p> Geralt lets out a low growl. He has spent fourteen years pointedly not thinking about Jaskier\u2019s mortality. His death is inevitable, yes, but the pain of dwelling on it is avoidable. And as Jaskier is so fond of pointing out, Geralt is a master of avoidance. </p>\n<p> \u201cWe have time,\u201d Lambert whispers. </p>\n<p> \u201cDo we?\u201d Eskel finally turns from the fire to meet his brothers\u2019 eyes. \u201cHumans slow down before they die. He won\u2019t be able to travel at some point, sooner rather than later if he keeps running towards danger like an idiot and ends up injured. Soon enough he won\u2019t be able to make it up the mountain, and then we lose our winters with him, too. He\u2019ll be gone from our lives long before he actually dies.\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cStop,\u201d Geralt snarls. \u201cFucking stop.\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cYou don\u2019t want to talk about it because you know I\u2019m right.\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cShut up!\u201d Lambert is on his feet, eyes blazing. \u201cYou <em>bastard.</em> Why now? Why can\u2019t you just be happy with what you have?\u201d</p>\n<p> Eskel pulls a twig from the kindling pile near the fireplace and feeds it to the flames. He speaks through a throat of broken glass. \u201cI can\u2019t stop thinking about it. Dreamt about it last night and now\u2026\u201d He trails off and stands, brushing dust off the back of his pants. His face is closed off and angry. At destiny. At mortality. Geralt knows the look well. \u201cFigured if I had to suffer, you two might as well join me.\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cFuck you,\u201d Geralt says. He\u2019s about to say more when a bright voice calls from the hallway that leads to the kitchen. </p>\n<p> \u201cGeralt! You\u2019ll never believe what-\u201c Jaskier rounds the corner with bounce in his step, but pulls up short when he sees the witchers around the fire. The smile falls from his face, replaced by a look of worry. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p>\n<p> Damn him. Geralt usually enjoys Jaskier\u2019s ability to read his expressions. It helped in the early days of their relationship, when he was even worse with words than he is now, and it helps every day on the road because Jaskier can tell what he needs before he asks, can tell is he\u2019s about to snap a few seconds before it actually happens. But sometimes, it\u2019s terrifying not being able to hide. Thinking about Jaskier\u2019s death shoots pain through his veins worse than any potion, and Jaskier can see it written all over his face. </p>\n<p> \u201cNothing,\u201d he grunts. It\u2019s a bald faced lie, and everyone in the room knows it.</p>\n<p> \u201cOkay,\u201d Jaskier says. He glances at Lambert and Eskel, then back at Geralt. <em>Tell me later?</em> </p>\n<p> Geralt had forgotten about the pendants. About Jaskier\u2019s direct, silent line of communication straight to his head. It\u2019s disconcerting to hear at all, and the situation is only made worse by the fact that Geralt will <em>not</em> be telling him later. It\u2019s not Lambert and Eskel\u2019s presence that is making him tight lipped. This is a topic that Jaskier doesn\u2019t need to hear about in front of anyone. Ever. Geralt grunts again in response, answering nothing, and does his best to ignore Jaskier\u2019s crestfallen expression. </p>\n<p> \u201cI\u2019m going hunting,\u201d Lambert says. He grabs a bow and arrow from the wall and strides out of the room without so much as a glance in Jaskier\u2019s direction. His unfinished meal is still steaming when the doors close behind him. </p>\n<p> Something dark curls into Jaskier\u2019s scent. The burnt sugar smell of confusion and hurt. It sets Geralt on edge. </p>\n<p> \u201cIgnore him. What did you want to tell us about?\u201d</p>\n<p> Jaskier shakes his head and tucks himself under Geralt\u2019s arm. \u201cNothing, really. Don\u2019t worry about it.\u201d </p>\n<p> Geralt wants to push, but the hurt is disappearing from his scent with every passing second, so he keeps his mouth shut. He wants to ask Jaskier to tell a story. Anything. Just so Geralt can focus on his voice instead of the images of Jaskier\u2019s body that filter past his eyes, broken and bleeding and old. He wants to ask but he knows he can\u2019t, because a request like that would set off Jaskier\u2019s \u201csomething is wrong\u201d alarm before Geralt could finish forming the words. He settles for pulling Jaskier closer instead, his quick, human heartbeat a blessed rush in Geralt's ears.</p>\n<p>\u2026</p>\n<p>Jaskier knows what people think of him. He\u2019s ditzy and loud, yes. He wears impractical clothes, and he\u2019s not cautious enough around monsters, and, before Geralt, he slept with <em>a lot</em> of people he should not have slept with. He\u2019ll admit that to anyone. Brag about it, actually. But silly as he might be, no one is fool enough to call him unobservant.</p>\n<p> Which is why Jaskier knows that something is very, very wrong. </p>\n<p> Lambert storming out of lunch was first. Then it was Eskel turning down their usual lute lesson, avoiding Jaskier\u2019s eyes as he made up some excuse about needing a bath. Alone. Geralt is quieter than normal, which is impressive for a man so stoic, and when they make love in the afternoon he\u2019s <em>gentle.</em> And not, <em>I love you so much I want to fuck you slowly,</em> gentle. It\u2019s more a, <em>I\u2019m worried one of us is going to break if I fuck you properly,</em> kind of gentle. That kind of love making is reserved for one of their frequent near-death experiences. It has no place here, at Kaer Morhen, where they\u2019re supposed to be <em>safe.</em></p>\n<p> As near as Jaskier can tell, nothing has changed. No monsters, no mages, no destiny mucking about in their lives. It was a perfectly normal morning until it suddenly, painfully <em>wasn\u2019t.</em></p>\n<p> He thought he could deal with it. Let them fight it off, or drink it away in the evening, and wake up the next morning in the blissful state of relaxation that came from having three very warm, very cuddly bedmates. His witchers would come back to him, when they worked through whatever was wrong. That\u2019s what he told himself. </p>\n<p> Then they stopped touching him. </p>\n<p> Not entirely. Not enough for him to call them on. Little things, like Eskel leaning away from a touch to his bicep. Lambert doesn\u2019t drape an arm around Jaskier at dinner. Geralt accepts Jaskier\u2019s hands in his hair, but he stops reaching out in return. No bumps of shoulders in the halls. No hands at his waist when he passes around tankards of ale. No fingers in on his skin, or lips against his neck, or thighs pressed hard against his own. </p>\n<p> Nothing. </p>\n<p> For the first time in months, Jaskier goes to sleep cold.</p>\n<p>\u2026</p>\n<p>It has been a while since Eskel felt this detached. Since the craving for touch and connection prickled underneath his skin. He hurts in a way he hasn\u2019t since he met Jaskier.</p>\n<p> And he\u2019s right there. All dusky hair and smiles that aren\u2019t quite as shining as they were a week ago. Right there. Just out of reach because every time he reaches out the sweet relief of touch is swept away by the screaming, burning horror of his own hateful voice. </p>\n<p> <em>He\u2019s going to die someday</em></p>\n<p> His dream still plagues him. Jaskier, torn apart by a werewolf. Jaskier, scarred and scratched from years on the road. Jaskier, slamming against a tree in a forest and not getting up again. No matter how loud Eskel screams, he never gets up again. </p>\n<p> So, as much as he can manage, he doesn\u2019t touch. They still sleep in the same bed, Jaskier would ask too many questions if they didn\u2019t, but he doesn\u2019t curl as close. He doesn\u2019t bury his face in Jaskier\u2019s hair. He <em>aches.</em></p>\n<p> Funny, how he\u2019d forgotten what that felt like.</p>\n<p>\u2026</p>\n<p>A week after Eskel\u2019s announcement by the fireplace, frustration is a thundercloud over Kaer Morhen. Vesemir retires early, citing exhaustion from hunting a deer for their dinner. Geralt knows the real reason is that he can\u2019t stand the oppressive scent of sadness that hangs around the main hall. A minute after Vesemir disappears, Jaskier stands up and slams his hand down on the table.</p>\n<p> \u201cEnough.\u201d His voice shakes, anger and pain swirling in his scent, and a hot rush of guilt sweeps down Geralt\u2019s spine. \u201cI\u2019m done being miserable, I\u2019m done dealing with you all avoiding me, and I am especially, absolutely fucking <em>done</em> with the lies.\u201d </p>\n<p> \u201cJaskier-\u201c Lambert tries. </p>\n<p> \u201cNo. Nope. I don\u2019t want to hear it. All three of you have been lying through your teeth for the last week that nothing is wrong when something is very clearly <em>terrible</em>, so someone better speak the fuck up. The truth, this time.\u201d </p>\n<p> \u201cOr what?\u201d Eskel asks, fear turning his words sharp. \u201cYou\u2019ll write a nasty song about us?\u201d</p>\n<p> Jaskier turns on him, hurt dull in his eyes, and Eskel makes a sound like he\u2019s been slapped. \u201cNo, actually. I haven\u2019t worked so hard to build up witchers\u2019 reputations just to tear it all down. But I will go sleep somewhere else, since you all clearly can\u2019t stand being around me anymore.\u201d</p>\n<p> Eskel nearly shatters the tankard in his hand. \u201cThat\u2019s not what this is about,\u201d he says firmly. </p>\n<p> \u201cOh, it\u2019s not?\u201d Jaskier throws his arms wide and lets out a bitter laugh. \u201cCould\u2019ve fooled me. You\u2019re all acting like- like I\u2019m some kind of <em>monster.\u201d</em> He chokes back a sob. In a voice so broken Geralt can barely hear it, he asks, \u201cWhat did I do?\u201d</p>\n<p> That\u2019s it. Geralt is on his feet and at Jaskier\u2019s side, pulling his head against his chest like he can hold this conversation at bay. Just a little longer. \u201cNothing. I swear to all the gods, Jaskier, you haven\u2019t done anything wrong.\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cThen <em>why?\u201d</em></p>\n<p> Geralt steps away. He can\u2019t help it. Lambert hovers a few feet from them, looking as helpless as Geralt feels, and Eskel\u2019s hands are fists at his sides. Each looks to the other, silently begging them to speak. Eskel is the one who finally makes the leap. </p>\n<p> \u201cJaskier, you-\u201c He breaks off to run a shaking hand down his face. \u201cYou\u2019re human. We\u2019ve known that for a while, but it finally hit home and we just couldn\u2019t\u2026touch you. Knowing we\u2019re going to lose you.\u201d</p>\n<p> Confusion sweeps across Jaskier\u2019s face, his brows lowered and mouth puckered in a way Geralt would have found sweet in any other situation. \u201cWhat?\u201d A hysterical laugh makes its way out of his throat. \u201cBut I\u2019m not-\u201c</p>\n<p> Silence. Every muscle in Geralt\u2019s body locks up, blood roaring past his ears in a deafening wave. He stares at Jaskier, uncomprehending. \u201cYou\u2019re not what, Jaskier?\u201d</p>\n<p> A new smell twists in the air. Acrid and burning. Fetid as a day old corpse. Geralt has never smelled it on Jaskier before, not like this. Not aimed at him. </p>\n<p> Jaskier steps away, shaking. \u201cI thought you <em>knew.\u201d</em></p>\n<p> Geralt is struck dumb by the scent rolling off of him. It slips down Geralt\u2019s throat and chokes him. He can\u2019t talk. Can barely think through the haze of fear dripping from Jaskier\u2019s pores. </p>\n<p> \u201cYou\u2019re not human,\u201d Eskel says. Wonder shines through in his voice, but Jaskier is too far gone to hear it. He keeps backing away, hands curled against his chest in a protective gesture that grabs what\u2019s left of Geralt\u2019s sanity and shatters it. </p>\n<p> \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Jaskier whispers. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to- I thought-\u201c</p>\n<p> He turns on his heel and Geralt\u2019s soul screams at him to move, to run, to go to Jaskier and hold him tight and never let him go, but his feet are rooted to the floor like he\u2019s cursed as Jaskier retreats, the smell of fear around him thicker than ever. </p>\n<p> Lambert snaps out of it first. He chokes on Jaskier\u2019s name and then he\u2019s gone, down the hall in a second to bury Jaskier against his chest. His hands are everywhere; running up Jaskier\u2019s arms and smoothing across his back, touching like none of them have in days. </p>\n<p> \u201cI\u2019m not going to hurt you,\u201d he mutters against Jaskier\u2019s skin. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing to be afraid of. Please, Jaskier, <em>please.</em> I won\u2019t hurt you.\u201d</p>\n<p> Geralt can\u2019t get a grip on his thoughts. Of course Lambert would never hurt him. Jaskier knows that. </p>\n<p> <em>Like I\u2019m some kind of monster.</em></p>\n<p> Jaskier knows they could never lay a finger on him. He must. But the acrid smell is still there, and Jaskier has twisted himself around so he can look at Geralt, body braced against Lambert\u2019s arms like he\u2019s expecting a blow. </p>\n<p> <em>I thought you knew.</em> </p>\n<p> There are parts of him he never meant for Jaskier to see. The dark parts. The monstrous parts. Parts that no human, no matter how foolish, could see and continue to love. But Jaskier is no human, and Geralt has decades to work on letting him in. </p>\n<p> Geralt crosses the distance between them with measured steps. He grasps Jaskier\u2019s hand. Sinks to his knees. Fear like death fills his senses but he pushes it away, focusing on the thread of sunlight beneath it. One tug pulls Jaskier from Lambert\u2019s arms and Geralt rises up to meet him, catching him with a hand around the hip and lowering him to the floor as gently as Geralt can manage. </p>\n<p> \u201cYou\u2019re not a monster, Jaskier.\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cI\u2019m not human.\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cNeither am I.\u201d He presses a kiss beneath Jaskier\u2019s ear and tilts his head up. \u201cI should have known,\u201d Geralt murmurs. \u201cThe flowers you braid in my hair never wilt.\u201d</p>\n<p> Jaskier laughs. He\u2019s still crying a little, so it\u2019s an awkward noise, but it\u2019s a laugh all the same. Damn if that doesn\u2019t twist something in Geralt\u2019s stomach. </p>\n<p> \u201cThe flowers, Geralt? Really? We\u2019ve been together for <em>fourteen years.</em>\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cSo?\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cSo?\u201d Jaskier echoes. Incredulity replaces the tremor in his voice. \u201cGeralt, do I <em>look</em> thirty-two to you?\u201d</p>\n<p> Geralt runs his eyes down Jaskier\u2019s face. He hardly looks a day older than when they met in Posada. Certainly not older than twenty. \u201cNo,\u201d he says. </p>\n<p> Jaskier opens his mouth to answer, but Eskel beats him to it. </p>\n<p> \u201cYou let him braid flowers in your hair?\u201d</p>\n<p> And just like that, the moment is broken. Tension disappears from Jaskier\u2019s body entirely and he sinks into Geralt\u2019s arms around him, boneless. Lambert kneels down next to them and lays a hand on Jaskier\u2019s back. Calm floods Geralt\u2019s system as the horrible smell of rot disappears completely, overlaid with honey wine and citrus as Jaskier dissolves into a fit of relieved laughter. </p>\n<p> \u201cYou would let him do the same,\u201d Geralt shoots back. </p>\n<p> Eskel sits beside Jaskier and sinks a hand into his hair, rubbing in little circles as he shrugs. \u201cYes. I would.\u201d </p>\n<p> They stay like that until Geralt\u2019s knees ache from the strain. He picks up a protesting Jaskier and brings him to the fire, settling down with his legs crossed and his bard held firmly in his lap. Eskel grabs his lute and plays them a few simple tunes until Jaskier relaxes enough to speak up. </p>\n<p> \u201cAren\u2019t you going to ask? What I am?\u201d</p>\n<p> Lambert\u2019s hand traces patterns over his knee. \u201cWould you like to tell us?\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cWood-elf,\u201d Jaskier offers. \u201cA quarter, on my mom\u2019s side. It\u2019s no good for much beyond growing plants a little better than average. And immortality, I guess, though I wasn\u2019t expecting that one.\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cGood,\u201d Eskel says. \u201cYou\u2019ll never be rid of us now.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u2026</p>\n<p>Vesemir finds them the next morning, still in yesterday\u2019s clothes, curled up in a pile around the embers of the fire. He doesn\u2019t say a word.</p>\n<p>\u2026</p>\n<p>The rest of winter passes in a haze of good food and better company. When the snow has melted and the Path calls once more, they say their goodbyes. Vesemir claps each witcher on the back before pulling Jaskier into a hug that\u2019s as sweet as it is brief. They head down the mountain together, the wolves and their bard, and when they part at the next town, it is with the knowledge that the separation is not forever.</p>\n<p> Vesemir clears out a closet in one of Kaer Morhen\u2019s abandoned hallways. He places Eskel\u2019s lute there, alongside a drawer of Jaskier\u2019s favorite sweets. Other items join them. A coat Lambert left behind. A gold brocade chemise from the floor of an upstairs hallway that smells suspiciously of two men in the throes of passion. Everything they will need when they return is left, carefully folded, in the closet for them to find. Through the heat of summer and decay of autumn. Through days and weeks and months of silence and stillness. The castle waits. </p>\n<p> Vesemir closes the doors that winter. The next time he opens them, a metal bird glints against his chest.</p>"
