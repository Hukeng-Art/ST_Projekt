  "text": "<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><b>Chapter One</b>:\u00a0</p>\n<p>Harry is shaken to reality by a chorus of sharp knocks against something wooden and hollow. His gaze is bleary and the room that he\u2019s in is cramped and dark. It makes his back straighten up, his heart tries to escape through his throat as he feels around. There are shelves and clothes, a book and <em> ah </em> \u2014 his glasses. He forces them over his nose.</p>\n<p>Harry\u2019s pretty sure that neither heaven nor hell are supposed to be a tiny, dark room. But then again, Harry had taken his own life, so maybe this <em> was </em> his afterlife. Forced to sit in a pitch black room with no one but himself to keep him preoccupied; to stew between his thoughts and his emotions. A recipe for madness if you asked him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Blinking a few times, Harry furrows his brows when he can finally make out a few things in the dark. There\u2019s a thread hanging above his head and he hesitantly raises his hand and pulls on it. There\u2019s a little \u2018click\u2019 sound and then the room is flooded with fluorescent light. It makes him screw his eyes shut tight. After a few seconds, Harry slowly flutters them open and gapes.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He\u2019s, <em> he\u2019s\u2014 </em></p>\n<p>\u201cWake up Potter!\u201d An all too familiar voice shouts from somewhere above him. There\u2019s a set of thumps as if someone\u2019s jumping up and down on the stairs. It sends a trail of dust onto Harry.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cMum!\u201d The same voice shouts a few seconds later, their feet thumping loudly against the ground as they run. \u201cHarry isn\u2019t making breakfast!\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em> He\u2019s back in the cupboard under the stairs. </em>\n</p>\n<p>Harry all but scrambles around and stumbles out of the cupboard, hitting his arm on the small door in the process, green eyes wide and breath caught in his throat. He frantically eyes everything. The hallway is the same, filled with pictures of Dudley throughout his years. The staircase is painted white, not a speck of dirt to be seen. The carpet is the same, boring shade of creamy white that it was all those years ago.\u00a0</p>\n<p>It makes him sick to his stomach.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Harry doesn\u2019t <em> want </em> this.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He\u2019d rather be under the illusion that he was in a cramped room with minimum to no space without anyone but himself, descending into madness as the years would go on.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cGet on with it, freak.\u201d Aunt Petunia hisses from the kitchen. \u201cDon\u2019t burn anything.\u201d She glares at him from her seat at the dining table, thin lips twisted into a scowl. It\u2019s so <em> normal,</em>\u00a0so <em> familiar</em>, so <em> bitter </em> that it makes Harry move on autopilot. He goes through the motions, moves around the kitchen like he\u2019s done it a thousand times before because he has. Dudley snides at him a few times and so does Uncle Vernon, but Harry\u2019s so, <em> so </em>out of it that he doesn\u2019t even register it.</p>\n<p>Not until Dudley starts shouting about his presents.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThirty-six?\u201d Dudley raises his voice, face turning pink with rage. \u201cBut last year, <em> last year </em>I had thirty-seven!\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Harry pours Uncle Vernon his morning coffee, holding back a sigh.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, well,\u201d Uncle Vernon wears a smile, \u201csome of them are quite bigger than they were last year.\u201d He tries to reason.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t care how big they are!\u201d Dudley yells.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Moving away, Harry stops paying attention at that point, knowing very well what happens next. By the time they make it to the zoo, Harry is tired. Not in the usual sense either. His shoulders are weighed down by such a heavy weight it makes him drag his feet behind the Dursley\u2019s. It\u2019s like his tiredness had once been a heavy jacket and now was just heavy bones. Harry had lived, survived, <em> endured</em>. He wasn\u2019t, he <em> isn't </em> ready to do that again.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s boring,\u201d Dudley makes a face, heaving an annoyed sigh that fogs up against the glass he\u2019s leaned against.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Harry waits until the Dursley\u2019s collectively turn and leave to go torment some other poor animals.</p>\n<p><em> \u201cAre you alright?\u201d </em> Harry asks, slipping into parseltongue. He holds his gaze on the beautiful serpent inside the reptile exhibit. <em> \u201cI\u2019m sorry about him. He doesn\u2019t understand what it\u2019s like. Lying there day after day. Watching people press their ugly faces in on you.\u201d\u00a0 </em></p>\n<p>The snake slowly raises his head and gives him something equivalent to a wink. It makes Harry give a shaky grin, glad that he\u2019s still able to speak the language of snakes. <em> \u201cCan you understand me?\u201d </em></p>\n<p>Raising its head higher, the snake slithers out its tongue to taste the air. It stares at Harry with intelligent eyes and nods.</p>\n<p><em> \u201cGood,\u201d </em> Harry nods his head back. He moves his gaze to the side and reads the sign there. It says a simple <em> \u2018bred in captivity.\u2019 </em> It makes Harry slump his shoulders. <em> \u201cYou know,\u201d </em> he starts off, turning his gaze back to the snake, <em> \u201cme and you aren\u2019t all that different. I\u2019ve never gotten to know my parents either.\u201d\u00a0 </em></p>\n<p>\u201cMum! Dad! Come here! You won\u2019t believe what this snake is doing!\u201d Dudley exclaims in excitement, elbowing Harry out of the way and effectively sending him down to the ground. Dudley presses himself right up against the glass of the reptile exhibit.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Just like last time.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Irritation sparks quickly within Harry. He glares up at Dudley with anger in his green eyes and wishes the glass would disappear and \u2014 and <em> it </em> does. He smirks when Dudley yelps and falls forward, splashing into the pond and yelling when he realises that he\u2019s face to face with a dangerous snake.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Harry can\u2019t help but laugh quietly. He watches with glee as the snake slithers itself over the railings and onto the floor in one smooth movement. <em> \u201cBrazil here I come!\u201d </em> The snake flicks its tongue out once more. <em> \u201cThanks amigo.\u201d\u00a0 </em></p>\n<p><em> \u201cAnytime,\u201d </em> Harry grins.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<b>Chapter Two:\u00a0</b>\n</p>\n<p>Harry goes through the mail, looking for the one letter that\u2019s addressed to him. Once he finds it, he stares at it for almost a full minute, tracing his eyes over the loopy letters and the red stamp with the Hogwarts emblem. It makes him feel nostalgic. For a second he thinks of Hermione and Ron and tears up. A lump forms in the back of his throat and he has to force himself to swallow through it dryly.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHurry it up!\u201d Uncle Vernon yells from the kitchen. It snaps Harry from out of his daze. With a sigh, Harry blinks always his tears. He shoves his Hogwarts acceptance letter underneath the door of his cupboard and brings the rest of the mail towards a waiting Vernon.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d Vernon voices, turning to look at Petunia who\u2019s noisily peering through the kitchen window at their neighbors. \u201cMarge is ill,\u201d he says.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat a pity,\u201d Aunt Petunia mutters. She moves away from the window and sits at the table beside Dudley. Harry does quick work of settling bacon and sausages across their plates, hungrily eyeing the pieces of food. The last time had eaten was about a week ago and that had been a pathetic slice of bread with some cheese. His Aunt seems to notice the hunger in his expression because she shoo\u2019s him away like one would shoo a stray dog from their doorstep.</p>\n<p>Later, under the guise of gardening, Harry pens an answer back to Hogwarts on a piece of ripped paper. He sends it along with an owl, the one that had been circling their house since this morning and it hoots at him before it takes off in flight. This time there are no letters flowing through the fireplace like a river, there are no long trips across the country or even Hagrid kicking down the door to take him away on his flying motorcycle.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The sun is high up in the sky, not a cloud to be seen and it makes Harry sweat in his oversized clothes. He pulls out the weeds between colourful flowers and mulls over his thoughts internally.</p>\n<p>He can\u2019t stay with the Dursleys. He needs to leave, as soon as possible. He also needs a wand. Trying to do magic without it was proving to be a hassle. He had managed to float a book in front of his face for a solid five seconds before he had sagged against his sorry excuse of a mattress and passed out. Ah, but where would he go? Harry supposes he could stay at the Leaky Cauldron. He\u2019ll need a disguise though.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Groaning, Harry resigns to his fate of forever having the worst luck.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Weeks pass by all the same, the days blurring together into one. Harry practices using his magic late at night. He floats books, manages to spell a crayon to write across his little wall and even fixes his glasses when Dudley breaks them the day prior. The priceless look on Aunt Petunia\u2019s face is all worth it, even when she tries to beat the \u2018freakishness\u2019 out of him.</p>\n<p>When the sun starts setting earlier and the air starts getting colder, Harry packs whatever little belongings he has into a ratty, old backpack and waits for the night to come. When the clock in the hallway chimes twelve o\u2019clock midnight, Harry focuses his magic onto the latch pinned to the outside of his cupboard door. It takes a few seconds to work, but after Harry wishes, wishes <em> really </em> hard, the latch opens with a quiet \u2018click'.</p>\n<p>The use of his magic makes him feel drowsy and he blinks several times to keep his eyes open. Harry shakes his head and pinches the skin on the back of his hand. It startles him enough to keep him awake. Slowly shuffling out, Harry closes the door behind him and clicks the latch back into place. He winces at the sound it makes, it seems much louder at night than day. Luckily enough, it doesn\u2019t wake his uncle or aunt or cousin.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Harry swipes a few pounds from Petunia\u2019s coat, enough to get him some food and transport to London. There\u2019s a split second where he thinks of staying, thinks of waiting for a teacher to come pick him up and take him shopping down diagon alley; like Hagrid had once done. And then the second thoughts disappear and Harry escapes into the night.\u00a0</p>\n<p>It\u2019s exhilarating to make his way down the street in the dark of the night, sort of\u2026 familiar. He stops once he\u2019s near the park that he had hid in so many times as a kid. Whenever Dudley and his uh, <em> friends</em>, decided to play Harry Hunting, hiding in the park was the easiest. It had the most hiding places.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Sighing, Harry sits down on the side of the curb and waits for the bus to arrive. There\u2019s only one bus that arrives this late. It\u2019s this old, rickety one that\u2019s been around far longer than both Harry and the Dursley\u2019s. Harry had used it once before \u2014 on the night that he had taken his own life.\u00a0</p>\n<p>When the bus arrives, Harry pays his fair and sits in the back, away from prying eyes. There are a couple of others sat on the bus, rowdy teenagers and late night workers mostly. Harry eyes then wearily, afraid that he might get caught right off the bat.</p>\n<p>After a half hour ride, Harry steps off and gets onto another bus. He stays on that one for a total of twenty minutes because a woman dressed in nurse attire had started asking him questions. Harry had avoided answering her questions and spewed our a few well formed lies like,<em> \u201cI\u2019m actually on my way home. I have night school, you see.\u201d </em>\u00a0</p>\n<p>She hadn\u2019t looked convinced and Harry had to escort himself onto another bus. He stayed on that one until it reached London, huddled in the back with his knees drawn up to his chest and face twisted in concentration as he tried to cast a Notice Me Not spell.\u00a0</p>\n<p>It worked, for the most part.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<b>Chapter Three:\u00a0</b>\n</p>\n<p>Harry falls face first into the bed of his new but temporary room. He sighs in relief, curling himself around soft sheets and burying his face into a plump pillow. Tom, the bartender and inn keeper, had looked skeptical of him at first, but after Harry promised that his parents would show up in a few days he had relented and let him have a room. There had been awkward questions, but Harry had smiled and charmed his way through. He had waxed poetry about his parents like some love struck fool and Tom had merely nodded his head and smiled. He had asked why Harry had came in so late and Harry had grinned and muttered something about adventure and how both his parents were Gryffindors and wanted him to try travelling alone for the first time. Tom had eaten up the lies easily and Harry almost felt bad.</p>\n<p>A<em>lmost.\u00a0</em></p>\n<p>That night, Harry falls asleep rather quickly. His dreams are filled with familiar faces, there are even flashes of red eyes and a cunning smile.\u00a0</p>\n<p>When morning comes, Harry slowly and reluctantly uncovers his face from the sheets. He blinks, closes his eyes and blinks again. There are streaks of sunlight that are floating through the window and dancing across his face. He groans and covers his face back up, trying to chase the remnants of his dreams. It must have been a nice one because he hadn\u2019t woken up in the middle of the night, body shaking and voice hoarse from screaming his pain out.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He tries to remember what he had dreamt but all he can make out is a pair of red eyes. Harry scowls and throws his covers off. Voldemort, he thinks. The name alone leaves a bittersweet taste in the back of his mouth. But why would a dream about Voldemort be anything nice? Harry scrunches up his nose in distaste and throws his legs over the side of the bed, rubbing his knuckles unto his eyes. He yawns. Grabbing his glasses from the bedside table, Harry settles them over the bridge of his nose. His stomach rumbles loudly and Harry drops his head into his hands, groaning as he does so.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Does he even have any money left? He had paid for the three buses that got him to London. And last night he had used whatever was left for a two night stay. The amount he had paid left him feeling green, but he was glad Tom had willingly agreed to accept his muggle money.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Heaving a tired sigh, Harry drags himself to his feet and gets ready for the day. Without any money, he realises he needs to get to Gringotts first. Breakfast can wait.\u00a0</p>\n<p>After he\u2019s brushed his teeth, washed his face and dressed into the nicest clothes he has \u2014 which really aren\u2019t all that nice but <em> still </em> . It\u2019s the thought that counts, right? Harry stares at himself in the mirror with a deep frown. Anyone who\u2019d look his way would obviously think <em> \u2018Oh look, there goes a mini James Potter\u2019 </em>and honestly, it\u2019s completely throwing his game off. Harry can\u2019t be recognised. He\u2019ll fuck up if he is.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tilting his head in thought, Harry thinks he might have a solution. Though he\u2019s not quite sure if it\u2019ll work. He narrows his eyes at himself in the mirror and concentrates his magic onto his hair. He imagines a nice, pretty shade of blonde. At first nothing happens and Harry drops his shoulders in defeat, but then his hair colour starts changing right before his eyes and a warmth that he\u2019s only ever associated with his wand flows right throughout his body.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Harry blinks owlishly, caught off guard. Well, because his hair isn\u2019t blonde. No. It\u2019s pink. Bright and bubbly. Sort of the same colour that Tonk\u2019s had been when he had last seen her.</p>\n<p>Shit.\u00a0</p>\n<p>As glad as Harry is that no one will think he's his father's carbon copy, he now has <em> atrocious </em> pink hair that will literally catch everyone\u2019s attention.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Harry can only groan and make frustrated sounds at himself. \u00a0</p>\n<p>The walk down Diagon\u2019s Alley is filled with Harry having to dodge around groups of gossiping witches and families and hoards of students that have come earlier to buy their yearly supplies. He sighs in relief when he makes it to Gringotts in one piece. No one had even spared him a second glance, which was\u2026 weird to say the least. Harry was always looked at, one way or another. People not staring down at him with disappointment or disgust or some sort of worship was new to him. It felt refreshing, actually.\u00a0</p>\n<p>If only it would stay that way. \u00a0</p>\n<p>His talk with Griphook is awkward, especially when the Goblin asks for a key that Harry doesn\u2019t have. But it\u2019s okay, because three drops of his blood identify him as Harry Potter and then he\u2019s being lead through many, many, many doors. \u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you have your key, Mr Potter?\u201d Ragnok asks, staring down his crooked nose at Harry who squirms in his seat. \u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2014well\u2014um,\u201d Harry fumbles over his words. <em> Great one, </em> he snarks at himself internally, <em> marvellous speech there buddy. </em>He flushes under the Goblins hard stare and clears his throat. \u201cI think, um, Dumbledore has it.\u201d He swallows around the tightness in his throat and flickers his gaze all around the office. It\u2019s dark, filled with many objects. Portraits are slung all over the room.</p>\n<p>\u201cDumbledore?\u201d Ragnok questions. \u201cWhy would he have it?\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry returns his gaze to the Goblin. \u201cBecause he\u2019s my guardian\u2026?\u201d He says, tone a little bit unsure. He definitely remembers Dumbledore having it and then giving it to Hagrid.</p>\n<p>\u201cGuardian?\u201d Ragnok lowers his gaze to the papers cluttered all over his desk. \u201cHe is no such thing, Mr Potter.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d is all Harry can say. It sounds quiet, tiny and barely there even to his own ears. He wonders if Ragnok had even heard him, but then the Goblin makes a sound akin to a hum. \u201cAnd you\u2019re sure Dumbledore has your key?\u201d He asks.</p>\n<p>\u201cUh, yes. Yes I\u2019m sure,\u201d Harry answers, nodding his head.</p>\n<p>Ragnok levels him with an unblinking stare. \u201cI suppose we could take it from him, without him knowing of course, and give it back to you?\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry thinks about it. Swiping his tongue over his lips nervously, he shakes his head. \u201cI think it would be better if you could make a new one and nullify the old one,\u201d he says. \u201cFor a price,\u201d Harry rushes to add.</p>\n<p>The Goblin gives another sound akin to a hum and then grins sharply, showing off all his fangs. \u201cWhat a great idea, Mr Potter.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Giving an uneasy smile, Harry can\u2019t help but feel like he\u2019s made some sort of deal with the devil.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<b>Chapter Four:\u00a0</b>\n</p>\n<p>Harry walks out of Gringotts, the pockets of his jeans heavier than they\u2019ve ever been before. He has a moleskine pouch in each pocket, filled to the brim with shiny coins he\u2019s not quite sure what to do with. There\u2019s also the matter of Dumbledore not being his guardian which is, quite frankly, confusing. If Dumbledore wasn\u2019t his magical guardian, then <em> who </em> was?\u00a0</p>\n<p>Shaking his head, Harry makes his way towards Madam Malkins. If he\u2019s going to navigate around the Wizarding World, he\u2019s going to need to get rid of Dudley's second hand\u2026 <em> clothes</em>. He might as well get his school robes while he\u2019s at it.</p>\n<p>The bell above the door jingles as Harry steps inside the shop. He lets the door close behind him, green eyes flickering all around him as he takes in his surroundings. There are mannequins in every corner, twirling and moving to a tune that only they can hear. Sheets of shiny material are zipping from one side to another, followed by colourful pins and gorgeous gemstones.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHere for your school robes?\u201d Madam Malkin asks, sticking her head out from the curtains behind her desk. There are decorative flowers and bows stuck all over her hair, her wand is tucked behind her ear. She smiles at Harry brightly and nearly trips around her desk to usher him onto a small podium.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cUm, yes,\u201d Harry nods his head, trying to not fidget as a tape measurement uncurls itself from his head to his toes. He\u2019s starting to feel a bit self conscious about himself. He\u2019s not exactly the epitome of healthy and handsome or whatever.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWonderful!\u201d Madam Malkin exclaims. \u201cIt\u2019s always a pleasure to meet all you first years coming in. Mind you, it\u2019s never as pleasurable as when the older years come back. They\u2019re all so full of themselves sometimes.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Harry laughs and feels himself go at ease. Madam Malkin chatters along and Harry finds himself answering questions and nodding when appropriate. He spends almost ten minutes on the small podium when a familiar flash of ginger hair enters the shop and catches his attention.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s\u2026 <em> Ron</em>.</p>\n<p>Feeling his throat tighten and his chest swell with heavy emotions, Harry tries not to stare at Ron so openly. But it\u2019s <em> hard.\u00a0</em>And it <em> hurts.</em></p>\n<p>\u201cBack for your robes, Mr Weasley?\u201d Madam Malkin steps away from Harry, greeting Ron with a fond smile and a ruffle for his orange hair. \u201cI thought the twins were supposed to drop by to pick them up.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Ron shrugs his shoulders. \u201cThey were,\u201d he says quietly. \u201cIt\u2019s okay that I\u2019ve come to get them, right?\u201d The corners of his lips lift into an awkward, barely there smile and it takes everything in Harry not to step off the podium and just engulf his best friend into a much needed hug.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s alright. How about you wait here with Mr, erm, Mr\u2026\u201d Madam Malkin trails off, the tone of her voice unsure as she turns back to look at Harry stood on the podium. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I\u2019ve forgotten to ask for your name.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry clears his throat and absentmindedly flattens his fringe across his forehead. It\u2019s a bad habit he can\u2019t quite get rid off. \u201cIt\u2019s Harry,\u201d he says softly, \u201cHarry Potter.\u201d</p>\n<p>The stunned look on both Ron\u2019s and Madam Malkins face has Harry fighting back a sigh. Maybe he should have given an alias or had said his name was simply <em> just Harry. </em></p>\n<p>\u201cO-oh.\u201d Madam Malkin stutters out. She blinks a few times and then gives a reassuring smile. \u201cWell Mr Weasley, if you could wait here with Mr Potter.\u201d The woman then disappears into a set of curtains behind her desk, muttering to herself giddily as she does so.</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you\u2026 I mean\u2026do you\u2026?\u201d Ron fumbles over his words, gazing at Harry with hopeful big, brown eyes.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe scar?\u201d Harry asks.</p>\n<p>Ron nods his head, curling his fingers around the front edge of his dark sweater. He nervously bites at his lips.</p>\n<p>Harry pushes back his fringe, showing off the thin, pinkish scar in the shape of a lightning that sits over his forehead.</p>\n<p>\u201cWoah,\u201d Ron breathes out in awe. \u201cIt\u2019s <em> really </em> you.\u201d He then furrows his brows and tilts his head to the side. \u201cBut why is your hair pink?\u201d</p>\n<p>Sighing, Harry gives a wry smile. \u201cIt\u2019s a long story,\u201d he mutters. An idea then sparks somewhere in his mind and he grins, wide and filled with excitement. \u201cI could tell you it over some ice cream from Florean Fortescue's, if you\u2019d like?\u201d</p>\n<p>With an enthusiastic nod from Ron, the rest of the day is filled with eating delicious ice cream and going from one shop to another. Harry buys enough snacks to share between them and even though Ron seems hesitant at first to take any, he does when Harry ushers him along and says that friends always share.</p>\n<p>The flush that settles over Ron\u2019s pale cheeks is cute. Harry watches him mouth the word \u2018friends\u2019 over and over again before he grins, bright and cheerful and giggles like a schoolgirl sat beside their crush.</p>\n<p>Eventually they stop at the Magical Menagerie. The shop is small, filled with cages upon cages and it smells horrid. There are brawny owls hooting and kneazles hissing, rats with intelligent eyes perk up once they spot them. Ron covers his nose with his hand and mutters out a, \u201cif you wanted an owl we could have gone to Eeylops Owl Emporium. It smells a lot better there.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Harry huffs out a short laugh. \u201cYeah,\u201d he says, \u201cI know.\u201d There\u2019s a shit eating grin on his face as he shuffles to the front of the shop and stops at it\u2019s desk. A female sits behind it, no older than a Hogwarts graduate. She scrunches up her nose at Harry and blows out a large bubble before she pops it. The pink gum sticks to her upper lip and she swipes it away with her tongue. \u201cWhat?\u201d She sniffs, leaning her chin into the palm of her hand.</p>\n<p>\u201cI was wondering,\u201d Harry starts off, his grin widening when the female begins to blow her bubble again, \u201cif you have any snakes?\u201d</p>\n<p>The girls gum immediately pops.</p>\n<p>Somewhere behind him, Ron makes a strangled noise.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<b>Chapter Five:\u00a0</b>\n</p>\n<p>\u201cY-you\u2019re, you\u2019re getting a snake?\u201d Ron stutters out, voice shaky. He stumbles after Harry into the back of the shop. The female with the chewing gum had ecstatically pulled Harry around the desk and into the back room, voice going a mile a minute about how snakes were great pets and how it was unfair that no one longer wanted them because of <em> you-know-who.</em>\u00a0The room is small, the windows are all covered with grime, so much actually, that you can\u2019t see out of them. Candles are lit around the room, emitting a soft golden glow.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell,\u201d the female pauses, lowering her line of sight to the only reptile habitat they have. It\u2019s a large, glass tank filled with a handful of snakes that are all lounging around themselves, curling this way and that way and huddling around heated rocks. \u201cThis is all that we have.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Harry gazes at the snakes, grinning wide. \u201c<em>Hello</em>,\u201d he says, crouching down so he can look at them better, \u201c<em>would anyone like to leave with me?\u201d </em>He asks.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Behind him, both Ron and the Hogwarts graduate make the same sound, an awkward mix between a gasp and a choke.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Harry ignores them in favour of watching how all the snakes immediately raise their little heads and start hissing.\u201c<em>Pick me! Pick me!\u201d </em> They yell. A black snake with a green underbelly pushes itself against the glass, \u201c<em>Speaker! Pick me!\u201d </em> It hisses, it\u2019s voice is sort of muffled against the side of the tank. \u201c<em>The others are stupid,\u201d </em>it says.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Huffing out a laugh, Harry can\u2019t help but think the snake funny. \u201c<em>Oh really?\u201d </em> He muses. \u201c<em>How so?\u201d\u00a0 </em></p>\n<p><em> \u201cThe only one stupid here is you.\u201d </em> A red snake slithers slowly down a heated rock. It\u2019s underbelly is yellow. \u201c<em>Excuse my brother,\u201d </em> she says, bumping her little head against the black and green snakes, <em> \u201che tends to forget his manners</em>.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Right, right.\u201d </em> The black snake nods his head up and down. <em> \u201cSo sorry for all these, uh,\u201d </em> he pauses as if to look for words, \u201c<em>what\u2019s that word again?\u201d\u00a0 </em></p>\n<p>The red and yellow snake gives something akin to sigh. \u201c<em>Heathens?\u201d\u00a0 </em></p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Yes! Heathens. So sorry for all these heathens in the back. They\u2019re not right for you, speaker. I\u2019m venomous and will kill your enemies if you wish. You should choose me.\u201d\u00a0 </em></p>\n<p>Harry hums, low and thoughtful. He watches as the red snake suddenly whips out its tail and hits the other snake against the back of its head in reprimand.</p>\n<p><em> \u201cI meant us,\u201d </em> the black snake hurries to add. \u201c<em>You should chose </em> <b> <em>us</em></b><em>.\u201d\u00a0 </em></p>\n<p>In the end Harry leaves the Magical Menagerie with two snakes. Weirdly enough, free of charge. Each one wraps itself around one of Harry\u2019s wrists, their bodies are thin, about the width and length of a pencil. The girl with the gum had stared at him like he had put the stars and the moon into the sky himself. Harry shrugs it off and instead eyes Ron out of the corner of his eyes. He looks a little\u2026 green around the edges.</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you alright?\u201d He asks, stopping at the side of the cobbled road. \u201cYou don\u2019t look too well.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s just,\u201d Ron\u2019s bottom lip quivers, he avoids looking Harry in the eyes when he rushes out a quiet, \u201cyou\u2019re a parselmouth.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Furrowing his brows, Harry does his best to look confused. \u201cParsel-<em>what </em>?\u201d</p>\n<p>This time it\u2019s Ron\u2019s turn to look confused. \u201cHarry,\u201d he starts off hesitantly, \u201cwhat language do you think you were speaking to the snakes?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell english, obviously.\u201d Harry answers.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cUh, well, you weren\u2019t. You were speaking parseltongue. It\u2019s the language of snakes. I\u2019ve heard that only descendants of Salazar Slytherin can speak it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>With a purse of his lips, Harry starts walking again. He reminds himself that he has to act like he doesn't know anything about the magical world. \u201cWho\u2019s this Salazar Slytherin guy anyways?\u201d He questions. Ron falls into step beside him, confusion clear on his freckled face. \u201cHe was one of the founding members of Hogwarts. There\u2019s four of them all together. The other three are Godric Gryffindor, Rowena Ravenclaw and Helga Hufflepuff.\u201d</p>\n<p>They walk in silence for a few seconds. Until, \u201cHow come you didn\u2019t know about it? The parseltongue, I mean. And about the founding members of Hogwarts?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cUh,\u201d Harry lamely fumbles. He scratches the back of his still pink hair in a sheepish manner. \u201cI\u2019ve only found out about the magical world recently.\u201d \u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, man.\u201d Ron shakes his head. There\u2019s a deep frown across his lips.\u201cWe better get to Flourish and Blotts then. You really need to see what they\u2019ve written about you.\u201d \u00a0</p>\n<p>Harry spends the rest of the day flipping through hordes of biographies. He goes through several at once and makes his disgust about them clear. They\u2019re all filled with <em> lies</em>, so many lies. There are lines and lines about how Harry has lived the perfect life. How he\u2019s had servants at his beck and call. How he\u2019s been fed like a King. How he\u2019s had a <em> loving </em> family. \u00a0</p>\n<p>Oh, they were <em> loving </em> alright. \u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Master</em><em>, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d </em>The black and green snake peaks its head out from Harry\u2019s sleeve and travels up his arm. \u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>You smell frustrated.\u201d </em> The red and yellow snake also peaks its head out and travels up Harry\u2019s sleeve. \u201c<em>Is</em>\u00a0<em>there something we can help with?\u201d \u00a0 </em></p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m okay,\u201d Harry breathes out in English. He flickers his gaze to a worried Ron who\u2019s stood at the end of the bookshelf, biting his nails and muttering quietly to himself. \u201c<em>But I\u2019m not sure if he is.\u201d\u00a0 </em></p>\n<p>Black and green slithers out his tongue to taste the air. <em> \u201cWoah,\u201d </em> he says. <em> \u201cThat\u2019s a lot of worry for someone so small.\u201d \u00a0 </em></p>\n<p>\u201cRon?\u201d Harry calls. \u201cYou okay there?\u201d</p>\n<p>Ron immediately matches his gaze with Harry\u2019s and makes his way towards him. \u201cI\u2019m\u2026 okay,\u201d the ginger haired male twists his fingers into the bottom of his jumper. \u201cIt\u2019s just that I\u2019ve built this image of you inside my head.\u201d He lowers his voice. \u201cI mean, you\u2019re Harry Potter. The boy-who-lived. You\u2019re famous! And I\u2019ve finally gotten to meet you and you\u2019re nothing like the books said you would be.\u201d He pauses to take a deep breath. \u201cYou\u2019re hair\u2019s pink and you can talk to snakes and you don\u2019t know anything about the wizarding world. It\u2019s scary, but it\u2019s you. And somehow that\u2019s better than what I expected.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry swells with emotion. He\u2019s so, <em> so </em> happy. His chest feels tight and his eyes feel sort of wet, but he blinks away his unshed tears and gives a blinding smile. \u201cThanks Ron. That means a lot to me.\u201d He murmurs.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Flushing, Ron mumbles out words Harry can\u2019t quit make out.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Let me nuzzle him!\u201d </em> Black and green hisses from Harry\u2019s shoulder. <em> \u201cPlease, please, please, please, please\u2014\u201c\u00a0 </em></p>\n<p>Ron\u2019s gaze lands onto the hissing snake, his eyes widen as he quickly takes several steps back. He must have momentarily forgotten about Harry\u2019s new companions.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>No, no, no, no. Don\u2019t be afraid of me, I just want to nuzzle you as a thanks\u2014\u201c\u00a0 </em></p>\n<p>\u201cHe just wants to thank you,\u201d Harry explains. \u201cAnd\u2026 nuzzle you?\u201d He trails off unsurely.</p>\n<p>\u201cN-nuzzle me?\u201d Ron squeaks out.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Harry softens his grin into a smile and slowly raises Black and Green towards Ron. The orangette stands still, shoulders tense and expression grim. Black and Green bumps it\u2019s head into Ron\u2019s cheek and then nuzzles against it, hissing softly.</p>\n<p>Ron\u2019s blush returns tenfold, likely in embarrassment. His shoulders relax. He even tentatively raises a hand and careful pets the snakes little head. \u201cHe\u2019s not so bad,\u201d Ron mutters. \u201cKinda cute.\u201d</p>\n<p>Black and green preens at the compliment when Harry translates for him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Ugh,</em>\u201d Red and yellow voices from Harry\u2019s other shoulder. With a laugh, Harry pets her and tells her how pretty her scales are. She hides underneath his sleeve again and doesn\u2019t come back out.</p>\n<p>Harry idly wonders if she\u2019s embarrassed too.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<b>Chapter Six:\u00a0</b>\n</p>\n<p>In the early morning light, Harry is sprawled over his bed on his stomach. His chin is placed in the palm of his hand and his green eyes are lazily peering down at a small, but thick book. It\u2019s an old thing, with wrinkled and yellow-y pages that are filled with names and their meanings. His hair is back to its normal dark colour, which is a weird relief. Harry\u2019s snakes are arguing just ahead of him, circling around each other on the dark brown carpet.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Master likes me better,\u201d </em> Black and Green declares.</p>\n<p><em> \u201cYeah? Well Master said my scales are beautiful,\u201d </em> Red and Yellow raises her head a little higher, she makes the snake equivalent sound to a <em> \u2018hmph.\u2019</em></p>\n<p><em> \u201cW-well Master thinks I\u2019m funny!\u201d </em>Black and Green hurries to add, stumbling over his words.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Harry laughs at the two quietly and returns his attention back to the book. He skims over a few names before he stumbles upon \u2018Nimmy.\u2019 It\u2019s Hindi and apparently means friend of fire. Harry thinks it\u2019s a good enough name for Red and Yellow. Her scales are red and yellow and her eyes are a weird mix between bright orange and neon yellow. Her colours scream Gryffindor. Her attitude on the other hand, screams Slytherin. The phrase \u2018a wolf in sheep\u2019s clothing\u2019 comes to mind. It makes Harry grin.\u00a0</p>\n<p><em> \u201cWhat about Nimmy?\u201d </em>He asks, slipping into parseltongue.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The two snakes stop bickering and both raise their heads towards him. <em> \u201cNimmy?\u201d </em>They chorus.\u00a0</p>\n<p><em> \u201cYeah.\u201d </em> Harry says and nods towards Red and Yellow. <em> \u201cFor you.\u201d </em> He elaborates. <em> \u201cIt means friend of fire.\u201d\u00a0 </em></p>\n<p><em>\u201cFriend of\u2014\u201d </em>Black and Green cuts himself off with an obnoxious laugh. He falls backwards onto his back, showcasing off his green belly as he wiggles on the carpet in hissy laughter. His colours matched Slytherin so well and yet he acted like such a Gryffindor.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Nimmy coils and sways her head from side to side, like she\u2019s readying herself for an attack. She unhinges her jaw, fangs flashing from the sunlight pooling I\u2019m from the window.\u00a0</p>\n<p><em> \u201cNimmy!\u201d </em>Harry calls in a warning tone.</p>\n<p>Immediately the Red and Yellow snake snaps her jaw shut and lowers herself to the carpet. She flickers her tongue out, tastes the disappointment floating through the air from her Master and curls into herself. The snake even goes as far as to hide her face into her scales.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Harry turns his gaze towards Black and Green. \u201c<em> And you,\u201d </em> he starts off, \u201c<em>shouldn\u2019t be laughing at your sister like that.\u201d </em></p>\n<p>Black and Green flickers his own tongue out and then curls into himself, lowering his head against his scales. <em> \u201cSorry Master,\u201d </em> he apologises, <em> \u201csorry Nimmy.\u201d </em>He then hesitantly slithers closer to Nimmy and nuzzles his face against the back of the females head. He pulls away when Nimmy raises her head.\u00a0</p>\n<p>She hisses out a quiet, <em> \u201cidiot,\u201d </em>and nuzzles her snout against her brothers.\u00a0</p>\n<p><em> \u201cBesides,\u201d </em> Harry peers down at his book and quickly thumbs through it, an amused smile gracing his lips, \u201c<em>your name isn\u2019t all that better.\u201d </em></p>\n<p>Nimmy flicks his tail behind her. \u201c<em>That isn\u2019t much of a surprise, Master.\u201d\u00a0 </em></p>\n<p>Snorting, Harry decides to name Black and Green after the first name he sees once he turns to one of the end pages. <em> \u201cIt\u2019s Verde,\u201d </em> he says, <em> \u201cmeans green.\u201d\u00a0 </em></p>\n<p><em> \u201cBut Master!\u201d </em> Verde whines. \u201c<em>That\u2019s boring!\u201d </em></p>\n<p>Closing the book, Harry gives an impish grin. <em> \u201cIt\u2019s too late to look for another name now, Verde. I\u2019ve already closed the book and I\u2019m too tired to open it again.\u201d </em></p>\n<p>Nimmy laughs. <em> \u201cThe correct word to use, Master, would be lazy. You\u2019re too lazy to open it again.\u201d </em></p>\n<p>Harry supposes she\u2019s right.\u00a0</p>\n<p>With only a few days left before the first term starts, Harry walks down Diagon Alley, going from one shop to another. He buys a set of cauldrons, two potion kits, the books he\u2019ll be needing for his first year and even stops by the Owl Emporium to pick up Hedwig. \u201cHello beautiful,\u201d Harry murmurs softly as he strokes her white feathers. He tries not to cry as she hoots at him and then takes flight, going to Harry\u2019s room in a shady place down in Knockturn Alley.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Harry had stayed at the Leaky Cauldron as long as he could without Tom, the bartender, getting suspicious. It had lasted a week before Harry broke down under Tom\u2019s narrowed gaze and concerned questions before he had just upped and left. After that he had took a walk down Knockturn Alley, hair bright and bubbly, atrocious and pink and got himself a room in an old inn run by a woman of the name \u2018Cynthia.\u2019 She didn\u2019t ask questions, just took one look at the arguing snakes around his throat, took his money and gave him a room. Harry was very thankful. The room wasn\u2019t as clean as the one in the Leaky Cauldron, but it was a lot better than his little cupboard. He still had a bed, a wardrobe, lots of space to move around and most importantly, secrecy.</p>\n<p>Humming, Harry enters Madam Malkin\u2019s Robes for All Occasions. He settles his shopping bangs on a nearby seating area and beams when he hears a delighted, \u201cMr Potter! Welcome back.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry turns around to greet Madam Malkin. \u201cHello,\u201d he says, tone shy of amused. \u201cHow has your day been so far?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>The woman doesn\u2019t seem to mind, because she grins herself. \u201cOh, it had been wonderful. I\u2019ve had many customers today, you see.\u201d She replies. Today, her hair is covered in feathers of all colours and once again, her wand is tucked behind her ear. \u201cAnd Oh! You look splendid!\u201d Madam Malkin gushes, once she eyes him over.</p>\n<p>Blushing, Harry runs his fingers down his dark green sweater. It hangs lowly off his shoulders and it\u2019s ever so soft. He had paired it with black jeans, that he had asked Madam Malkin to make a few days prior, and a pair of high converse that he had bought out in muggle London. He had sneaked past Tom in the Leaky Cauldron not long ago to buy them. \u201cThank you,\u201d Harry says earnestly.</p>\n<p>With a coo, Madam Malkin ushers him towards her desk, \u201cI\u2019ve got your robes and your custom clothes ready, I\u2019ll be right back Mr. Potter.\u201d She flashes him another grin and then disappears behind the curtains.</p>\n<p><em> \u201cShe\u2019s always so chatty.\u201d </em>Nimmy voices from where she\u2019s curled around the right side of Harry\u2019s neck, head laid gently over his collar bones.</p>\n<p><em> \u201cShe\u2019s nice though,\u201d </em> Harry says quietly. <em> \u201cAnd she hasn\u2019t given away my location to any media or Dumbledore, for that matter.\u201d\u00a0</em></p>\n<p><em> \u201cDo you trust her, Master?\u201d </em>Verde questions from where he\u2019s curled around Harry\u2019s neck on the left side, his head laid gently over bony collarbones.</p>\n<p><em> \u201cI guess,\u201d </em> Harry answers. <em> \u201cIt\u2019s not like she has a reason to betray my trust in her\u2014\u201c </em></p>\n<p>A series of soft noises, like a \u2018thud,\u2019 sound just behind Harry and cut him off. Raising a brow, Harry turns around only to come face to face with three familiar blondes with the same silvery grey eyes.</p>\n<p>The Malfoy's.</p>\n<p>Draco is staring at him with wide eyes, hands awkwardly held out in front of him, like he had dropped something and tried to catch it. Narcissa is stood behind him, her eyebrows are slowly trailing higher and higher up her forehead. Lucius on the other hand, looks like everything he had fought for had just slipped between his fingers.</p>\n<p>Lowering his line of sight, Harry eyes the many dress boxes that are littered across the plush carpet. Most of them are half open, showcasing a variety of rich materials. <em> Ah, so that\u2019s what Draco had dropped</em>.</p>\n<p>Harry raises his gaze back up. \u201cIt\u2019s the hair, isn\u2019t it?\u201d He smiles. \u201cPeople are always having different reactions towards it.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Internally, Harry screams a series of <em> fuck, fuck, fuck.\u00a0 </em></p>\n<p>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>Chapter Seven:\u00a0</b>\n</p>\n<p>Narcissa is the quickest to school her shock into an emotionless facade. \u201cIt\u2019s most certainly is the\u2026 hair.\u201d She gives a forced smile, small and sharp. It makes the hairs on the back of Harry\u2019s neck stand to attention. \u201cForgive us.\u201d Narcissa lowers her head into a barely there bow, a mockery of a real one. \u201cIt\u2019s not everyday that we\u2019re met with such a \u2026 daring hair colour.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d Lucius agrees, curling his lips in distaste as he eyes Harry up and down with a critical eye. His gaze stops on Nimmy and Verde. \u201cIt\u2019s daring, indeed.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p><em> \u201cMaster, you smell anxious.\u201d </em> Nimmy voices her worry. She raises her little head and bumps it against Harry\u2019s cheek in a show of reassurance. Harry exhales a long, drawn out breath. He\u2019s fucked. Here he was speaking in parseltongue and now he was fucking caught. <em> Great going Harry, </em> he snides at himself internally, <em> now they know and you\u2019re gonna have to kill yourself again cause you\u2019re a god damn idiot.\u00a0 </em></p>\n<p>Verde seems to sense his want of offing himself because he unhinges his jaw and snaps it warningly at the Malfoy\u2019s. Draco visibly flinches. \u201c<em>Enemies.\u201d </em>Verde hisses, fangs glinting.\u00a0</p>\n<p><em> \u201cVerde!\u201d </em> Harry warns and hurriedly pushes the snake back against his neck. <em> \u201cNot in public!\u201d\u00a0 </em></p>\n<p><em>\u201cOh? So I can hurt them behind closed doors? Is that what you\u2019re saying Master?\u201d </em>Verde flicks out his tongue against the hollow of Harry\u2019s throat. \u201c<em>If</em> <em>they hurt you Master, I\u2019ll hurt them back.\u201d\u00a0</em></p>\n<p>Flushing, Harry drops down to the plush carpet and starts closing the dress boxes and piling them upon one another. <em> \u201cThat isn\u2019t what I meant,\u201d </em>he mutters.</p>\n<p>\u201cSorry,\u201d Harry says, switching back to English. He sort of realises he doesn\u2019t quite give a damn. Let them know. Let Dumbledore worry his ass over the small things when he finds out. Let the Malfoy\u2019s think whatever they want. \u201cVerde\u2019s a little protective sometimes.\u201d Harry hauls himself up and holds out the dress boxes to a wide eyed Draco.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lucius clears his throat and settles his hand onto his son\u2019s shoulder. It must have been some sort of coded message because Draco schools his features the same way Narcissa had moments ago and takes the dress boxes from Harry\u2019s hands. \u201cThank you,\u201d he says, dipping his head into a small nod.\u00a0</p>\n<p><em> \u201cDon\u2019t be fooled, they smell of confusion.</em>\u201d Nimmy comments.</p>\n<p><em> \u201cAnd fear.\u201d </em>Verde adds gleefully.\u00a0</p>\n<p><em> \u201cGee,\u201d </em> Harry mumbles, <em> \u201cI can only wonder why.\u201d\u00a0 </em></p>\n<p>Madam Malkin tumbles out from between the curtains, a handful of colourful bags floating above her head. \u201cSorry for the long wait Mr. Potter, I couldn\u2019t quite find all the robes you wanted.\u201d She smiles and lowers the bags onto her desk.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Harry turns around to give her a very, very grateful look. <em> My saviour, </em>he thinks. \u201cIt\u2019s alright,\u201d He mirrors her smile and pulls out a pouch filled with money. \u201cThere\u2019s a little extra,\u201d he says, placing it in front of Madam Malkin, \u201cfor all your hard work.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>A blush covers the females cheeks, her smile widening. \u201cOh, you didn\u2019t have to. Thank you though.\u201d Madam Malkin flickers her line of sight over Harry\u2019s shoulders by chance. When she realises who exactly is stood behind Harry, her smile doesn\u2019t quite reach the corners of her eyes anymore. \u201cMr. Malfoy, Lady Malfoy, Heir Malfoy,\u201d she greets quietly, lowering her head in a show of a bow. It\u2019s not the mocking one, not like the one that Narcissa had given Harry.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Sensing some weird-ass power play, Harry ducks his head, grabs all his bags (even the ones he had placed on the seating area before) and leaves before anyone can stop him. He hopes Madam Malkin understands. After a while of walking, he decides his long awaited arrival at Ollivander\u2019s is up. With a sigh, Harry enters the old, dusty shop. Within moments of eyeing all the wand boxes, which are mostly covered in cobwebs, Ollivander strides somewhere from the back of the shop to stand behind his desk.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He stares at Harry with his peculiar eyes, they\u2019re sort of misty, filled with some odd type of haze. Luna had usually stared at him the same way.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Clearing his throat, Harry utters a small, \u201cHello.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cMr. Potter,\u201d Mr Ollivander blinks the haze in his eyes away and starts talking. He mentions Lily and James, which brings a bittersweet taste to Harry\u2019s mouth. His mum had been great, but his father\u2026 he had been a bully. And that hurt. When Harry finally wraps his hand around his wand and a familiar warmth shoots throughout his body, he releases a relieved sigh. He\u2019s just glad to have it back. Unfortunately, he knows what\u2019s next. The speech.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cCurious.... Very curious\u2026\u201d Mr. Ollivander trails off. His eyes are now sharp and clear.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s curious?\u201d Harry asks, pocketing his wand.\u00a0</p>\n<p>With a tilt of his head, Ollivander answers in a quiet, soft voice. \u201cI remember every wand I've ever sold, Mr Potter. Every single wand. And it just so happens that the phoenix, whose tail feather resides in your wand, gave another feather. Just one other. It is curious that you should be destined for this wand, when its brother gave you that scar.\u201d</p>\n<p>Feeling his stomach churn, Harry opens his mouth to ask the same question he had many, many years ago. \u201cAnd who owned that wand?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe do not speak his name. The wand chooses the wizard, Mr. Potter. It's not always clear why. But,\u201d the wand maker pauses, \u201cI think it is clear that we can expect great things from you, Mr Potter. After all, He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named did great things also. Terrible, yes... but great.\u201d</p>\n<p>Straightening his back, Harry pays for his wand with a forced smile and leaves.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s not Voldemort.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s not some golden boy.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s not some tool to be used for the war.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s not the boy-who-lived.</p>\n<p>No. Not anymore.</p>\n<p>Harry\u2019s going to take matters into his own hands.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s going to tell fate to go screw herself.</p>\n<p>Consequences be damned.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>Chapter Eight:\u00a0</b>\n</p>\n<p>Well, Harry <em> had </em> said <em> consequences be damned.\u00a0 </em></p>\n<p>He just didn\u2019t think it would apply <em> so </em> soon.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Platform nine and three quarters is as full as ever. Students are running around. Family\u2019s are saying their last, teary goodbyes for the semester. Familiars are noisily hooting in their cages, meowing as they easily run between people's legs and croak as they jump around with their human counterparts running after them. There's a black raven perched on someone's shoulder, a large spider is locked in a small cage and even graceful like rats with high intelligence in their eyes are held in hands like prized possessions. Harry even spots a white and purple scaled lizard wrapped around a Ravenclaw's neck from the corner of his eye.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, his main attention is held on Ron Weasley and Draco Malfoy \u2014 who are both stood in front of him, arguing. Ron had spotted Harry from afar and came tumbling forward, blushing as he asked how Harry had gotten his hair black. At the same time, Draco had showed up out of nowhere, sticking out his hand and introducing himself with an air of superiority. Sighing, Harry tries to analyse the situation. The Malfoys are stood somewhere further to Harry\u2019s right. He can just about see them if he turns his head. Lucius\u2019s gaze is narrowed and his grip is tight on his cane. Narcissa is stood beside him, hand on his shoulder in some silent show of support. Harry doesn\u2019t buy it for one second. The Weasley\u2019s on the other hand are actually out of sight, but not out of hearing range. Harry had heard the twins mucking about not long ago and Molly had screamed their ears off. They were probably close too.\u00a0</p>\n<p>While Ron\u2019s friendship (somewhat, arguably) was pure of heart, Draco\u2019s was probably forced by his parents.</p>\n<p>It didn\u2019t matter. Harry was lonely anyways.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cLet me see,\u201d Draco curls his lips in distaste, eyeing Ron up and down. \u201cRed hair and hand-me-down clothes? You must be a Weasley.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Ron puffs out his cheeks in defiance. Harry thinks it\u2019s kind of cute when he does that. \u201cAt least I\u2019m no bleached blonde,\u201d he mutters lowly.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Hiding a laugh behind a cough, Harry awkwardly rubs the back of his neck. As nostalgic and normal as it is to see the two arguing, Harry is tired. Really tired. And honestly, he doesn\u2019t want to go through Hogwarts with having to look behind his back every few minutes because of Draco. Or anyone else for that matter. Why couldn\u2019t they all just go through Hogwarts like some good friends? Great friends even? The best of friends actually?\u00a0</p>\n<p>Having decided what he wants, Harry grabs Ron and Draco by the ears. At once, their arguing ceases and turns into a chorus of <em> \u201cow, ow, ow\u2019s.</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>Putting on his most displeased frown, Harry waits for the two to quiet down. When they do, he opens his mouth to softly say, \u201cIf you don\u2019t stop arguing, then neither of you will get to sit with me on the train.\u201d He then releases their ears and places his hands on his hips, much like Molly used to do when she was telling her kids off.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSorry.\u201d Ron apologises, rubbing at his ear. There\u2019s an embarrassed flush to his cheeks that highlights his freckles prettily.\u00a0</p>\n<p>For a moment, Draco looks awe struck at the sight and then he\u2019s shaking his head from side to side as if to clear his thoughts. \u201cI apologise also,\u201d he says.\u00a0</p>\n<p><em> \u201cWhat\u2019s this? What\u2019s this? I smell embarrassment.\u201d </em> Verde pokes his little head out from underneath Harry\u2019s robes, nuzzling it against the underside of his master's jaw. When he spots Ron he visibly perks up. <em> \u201cOh! It's the cute one! I want to nuzzle him again. Master, please. Please, please, please\u2014\u201d </em></p>\n<p><em> \u201cAlright,\u201d </em>Harry cuts Verde off with a sigh. \u201cHere,\u201d he says, holding out the black and green snake to Ron. \u201cVerde says he misses you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Ron\u2019s cheeks darken further. \u201cOh, um,\u201d he fumbles as he carefully takes Verde into his own hands, the tips of his ears turning red when Verde bumps his head against his cheek and then nuzzles into him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Draco looks positively confused and\u2026 jealous? Harry isn\u2019t too sure.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAnyways,\u201d he says, gently placing his fingers over his right collarbone to check for Nimmy, she\u2019s still there, asleep. \u201cWe should get on the train and get a good compartment while we still can.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>As soon as they get onto the train, Harry makes a beeline for the first empty compartment he sees. He sits beside the window, Ron sits opposite him and Draco sits on the same side, closer to the now closed doors. Soon the train leaves the station with a loud whistle and makes a steadily increasing chugging sound.</p>\n<p>The three talk civilly, for the most part. There are a few moments where Draco\u2019s haughtiness shines through and a few times where Ron mutters something childish under his breath but other than that, it\u2019s\u2026 surprisingly peaceful. Verde stays around Ron\u2019s neck and occasional raises his little snout to nuzzle against the Weasley\u2019s cheek or to flick his tongue against the hollow of his throat in a possessive manner. He even hisses quiet threats at Draco whenever the blonde so much as shifts. Harry thinks Verde might have a favourite.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSo,\u201d Draco shifts his gaze from the black and green snake around Ron\u2019s throat to Harry beside the window, \u201cDo you have any other familiars?\u201d He asks.</p>\n<p>\u201cI do.\u201d Harry answers. \u201cAn owl. She\u2019s pretty. Snow White, you know? Her names Hedwig.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Draco makes a humming sound. \u201cI have an eagle,\u201d he says, twisting his nose, \u201che\u2019s a bit\u2026 eccentric.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Ron snorts. \u201cWe had one a while back. It was an old one. It\u2019s ego was too big and it wouldn\u2019t listen to anyone, so we set it free.\u201d</p>\n<p>Quirking a brow, Draco returns his line of sight towards Ron. \u201cYou set it free?\u201d He questions. The blonde then makes a mournful face, \u201cI wish I could do the same.\u201d</p>\n<p>Afterwards, the woman with the sweet trolley shows up. Harry makes sure to buy enough for the three of them. Draco looks a little surprised as he thanks him. Ron mumbles his thanks with red ears and takes to eating some little square chocolates that Harry doesn\u2019t know the name of. When Harry gets Dumbledore\u2019s card from the chocolate frog, he crumples it and throws it amongst the pile of sweet wrappers. He feels sudden anger and frustration he can\u2019t quite explain.</p>\n<p>Actually he can.</p>\n<p>Because Dumbledore was always spewing half truths and half lies.</p>\n<p>And Harry wouldn\u2019t listen to him this time.</p>\n<p>No, he wouldn\u2019t.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat was Dumbledore.\u201d Draco states, voice quiet. His silver eyes are trained on the crumpled up card.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Harry pulls a leg up to his chest and balances his arm along his bony knee. \u201cHe\u2019s not exactly in my good books.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cH-he isn\u2019t?\u201d Ron stutters out. His brown eyes are filled with worry and his brows are furrowed in confusion.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s kind of\u2026\u201d Harry pauses as he flickers his gaze to Draco. If they\u2019re going to be the best of friends, Harry\u2019s going to have to put more trust into him. \u201cHe\u2019s kind of the reason why I didn\u2019t know anything about the\u00a0Wizarding world.\u201d</p>\n<p>Ron lets out a small \u201c<em>Oh</em>,\u201d and Draco makes a scandalised \u201c<em>What?\u201d </em> at the same time <em> . </em></p>\n<p><em> \u201cWhat\u2019s with all the noise?\u201d </em> Nimmy lazily raises herself from Harry\u2019s collarbone. She makes a sound equivalent to a human\u2019s yawn and Harry coos at her. While Ron explains Harry\u2019s situation to Draco, Harry holds Nimmy in his hands and pets her red and yellow scales. <em> \u201cYou were asleep for a very long time,\u201d </em>he says lowly.</p>\n<p>Nimmy wraps herself around Harry\u2019s fingers. <em> \u201cWere you worried about me, Master?\u201d </em>She asks.</p>\n<p>Smiling, Harry answers the snake with a fond, <em> \u201ca little</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>Opposite him, Draco makes a strangled noise. \u201cI can\u2019t believe this!\u201d He exclaims. \u201cMy father will <em> absolutely </em> hear about this.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p><br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>Chapter Nine:\u00a0</b>\n</p>\n<p>A few hours into their train ride and Draco is still seething, silently now, at least.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Earlier, he had been grumbling under his breath and making promising threats that even had Verde nodding along. Ron had looked a little red at hearing the creative ways that Draco wanted to tell Dumbledore to <em> shove it,\u00a0</em>but nevertheless he more or less agreed. Ron even mumbled a quiet, \u201c<em>I thought he was better than that,\u201d </em> which resulted in Draco\u2019s eyes narrowing as he started up a whole other rant. And because of that, Nimmy took a surprising liking to Draco. She insisted on getting closer to the blonde and after reassuring Draco that Nimmy had more control than Verde with her anger, <em> (which was a lie, but whatever), </em> she ended up across the blonde\u2019s lap and looked pretty smug about it. It seemed, that even Nimmy had gained a favourite.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSay,\u201d Ron pauses to maneuver Verde from where he\u2019s trying to climb onto the orangette\u2019s head and holds him in his hands instead, \u201cWhat house do you think you\u2019ll end up in?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSlytherin.\u201d Draco answers instantly. \u201cMy family\u2019s been in it for generations.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>A frown graces Ron\u2019s lips. \u201cSame,\u201d he says, \u201cI can\u2019t imagine being placed anywhere but Gryffindor.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>With a tilt of his head, Draco shifts so he\u2019s facing Ron fully. \u201cYou don\u2019t particularly sound happy about that,\u201d he points out, gently picking Nimmy up and placing her onto his shoulder instead. The red and yellow snake wraps herself around Draco\u2019s neck and gives a content hiss.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t get me wrong,\u201d Ron says, \u201cGryffindor is great. Really, it is. I just\u2026\u201d He trails of unsurely. With a shake of his head, he mutters a quiet, \u201cNevermind.\u201d</p>\n<p>When Draco furrows his brows and twists his lips into a deep frown, Harry awkwardly clears his throat to stop him from asking a question which could potentially make Ron sad. Instead, he opens his mouth to speak. \u201cI\u2019d actually like to be in Slytherin,\u201d he admits. Ironically, when he says those words, it\u2019s like a bit of weight lifts itself from his shoulders.\u00a0</p>\n<p>At once, Ron and Draco gawk at him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cBut, but you\u2019re\u2026 <em> you\u2019re Harry Potter.\u201d </em> Draco breathes out, bewildered.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Harry can\u2019t help but snort.\u00a0</p>\n<p>About an hour later, Harry comes to realise one tiny, important detail.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Ron doesn\u2019t have a rat with him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em> Traitor. Pettigrew. Kill. Kill. Kill. Kill\u2014 </em>\n</p>\n<p>Harry gives a smile that doesn\u2019t quite reach the corners of his eyes. He can\u2019t think about Sirius. Not here. Certainly not now.\u00a0<em>\u201cVerde,\u201d </em> he calls, slipping into parseltongue. <em> \u201cI need you to stay with Ron until he gets a rat. It\u2019s ugly, missing a toe. Don\u2019t kill it, just\u2026 paralyse it.\u201d </em></p>\n<p><em> \u201cOf course, Master.\u201d </em>Verde nods.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Ron and Draco stare at Harry curiously.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI was just telling Verde to stay with Ron until he gets a familiar of his own.\u201d He explains. \u201cSince it looks like you don\u2019t have one yet.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, um, thanks.\u201d Ron flushes and ducks his head, nuzzling his cheek carefully against Verde\u2019s black and green scales. \u201cI\u2019ll take good care of him.\u201d He murmurs.\u00a0</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a sudden hoot at the side of the window which catches the three\u2019s attention. Harry slides the window open and steps to the side as a flurry of white feathers flies in. The coldness of the outside sends shivers running up his spine.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHedwig?\u201d Harry raises a brow as the white owl sits on his shoulder. She gives another hoot and holds out a clawed foot. There\u2019s a small parcel attached to it.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDid you order something?\u201d Ron asks, holding Verde closer to his chest.</p>\n<p>Going through his recent memories, Harry realises that he had indeed ordered something. A book, actually. \u201cYeah,\u201d He answers. \u201cI did.\u201d Harry detaches the parcel from Hedwig\u2019s leg and then watches as the owl swoops back outside. He then quickly slides the window closed and sits back in his spot.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Draco asks.</p>\n<p>Harry fiddles with the brown wrapping paper and opens it apart. \u201cI ordered a family tree book,\u201d he says and then quietly adds, \u201cI wanted to see if I had any living family out there.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cMaybe you do.\u201d Draco leans closer to peer at the book. \u201cI think we have the same one in our library, but I\u2019ve only looked through it about twice. I don\u2019t remember much of it, if I\u2019m being honest.\u201d</p>\n<p>Running his fingers down the simple black cover with a white tree, Harry hums. He then flips it open and thumbs through the pages. They feel soft under the pads of his finger tips. He stops when he gets to the Potter page. There are hoards of names, Hardwin Potter, Henry Potter, Fleamont and Euphumia Potter, Charlus Potter and\u2026 Dorea Potter (ne\u00e9) Black.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh.\u201d Harry blinks. \u201cIt says here that my grandmother was a Black.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cReally?\u201d Draco raises both his eyebrows in wonder.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Harry nods. And upon further inspection, there\u2019s a Greengrass, a Rowle, a Sayre and also someone by the name of Linfred of Stinchombe. \u201cHere,\u201d Harry says, passing along the book to Draco who grabs it eagerly. \u201cYou can have a look through it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThanks.\u201d Draco mumbles and then starts flipping through the pages with a weird glint in his eyes. Ron shoots closer to the blonde and looks over his shoulder. \u201cWhat are you looking for?\u201d He asks.</p>\n<p>Draco doesn\u2019t answer him. Instead, he stops at a page and grins. It\u2019s not a nice grin either, it\u2019s kind of sharp. It looks odd on Draco\u2019s young face. He places the book onto his lap, points something out to Ron and then moves his finger across the page a few times. Each time, Ron\u2019s face brightens in surprise more and more.</p>\n<p>Harry watches as Draco wraps an arm around Ron\u2019s waist and pulls him closer to himself, like personal space suddenly doesn\u2019t seem to matter to him at all. Ron instantly blushes and raises his head, eyes wide in alarm. Draco also raises his head, but now their faces are mere centimetres apart.</p>\n<p>Popping an apple flavoured sweet into his mouth, Harry gazes at Draco and Ron with rapt attention. Dear Merlin, those two looked like they were about to kiss.</p>\n<p>Draco smoothly tilts his head and moves to talk directly into Ron\u2019s ear. The movement looks so easy, too. He whispers something that has Ron gasping and exclaiming, \u201cReally?\u201d</p>\n<p><em> \u201cThere\u2019s also a Black in the Weasley family.\u201d </em> Nimmy voices quietly from Draco\u2019s neck. <em> \u201cTwo of them actually. And a Crouch,\u201d </em> she pauses as she squints her eyes down at the book on Draco\u2019s lap. <em> \u201cThese human letters are always so hard to decipher,\u201d </em> She complains. <em> \u201cThere\u2019s also a woman by the name of Yaxley.\u201d </em></p>\n<p>Harry props his elbow onto the ledge of the window and places his chin into the palm of his hand. Huh. So the Weasley\u2019s, a prominent light family, were related to some dark families as well? That was interesting to know.</p>\n<p>The rest of their journey is spent on mindless chatter. They talk about which lessons they\u2019re excited for, which Professors they\u2019ll hope they have and many other things. Eventually they get changed into their robes and before they know it they\u2019re getting herded onto small boats by Hagrid.</p>\n<p>It hurts to see him.</p>\n<p>But it\u2019s even more painful to see Hermione stood at the side, awkwardly climbing into a boat along with Neville.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou alright, Potter?\u201d Draco asks, turning back around when he doesn\u2019t feel Harry following after him</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, <em> Draco.\u201d\u00a0</em>Harry smiles, \u201cI\u2019m good.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s cold,\u201d Ron complains once Draco and Harry join him in the boat. He tucks his hands between his knees and hunches his shoulders. \u201cAnd we\u2019re surrounded by water. It\u2019s making me anxious.\u201d</p>\n<p><em> \u201cHe certainly smells like it.\u201d </em>Verde comments somewhere from underneath Ron\u2019s robes. He\u2019s hiding inside them, trying to keep himself warm.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d Harry reassures, \u201cthe trip shouldn\u2019t be too long.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHopefully,\u201d Draco mutters under his breath.</p>\n<p>When Hogwarts comes into view, Harry can\u2019t help but give a content sigh. He\u2019s home. He\u2019s finally back home. Students all around him awe at the sight and whisper amongst each other. Harry helps Ron climb out of the boat and onto the ground. He looks very thankful. The trek up to the castle is oddly silent, like the new students are filled with so much wonder that it\u2019s made them speechless.</p>\n<p>The moment Harry steps foot into the castle, warm magic washes over him to welcome him back, almost like a mother would do when her child returned home from playing outside. It felt nice and calmed him down.</p>\n<p>Before Harry even knows it, they\u2019re walking into the great hall in pairs. Harry is stood next to some female he doesn\u2019t know the name of and behind him, Draco walks with Ron.</p>\n<p>Harry overhears Ron whisper, \u201cWhat if we have to battle a troll?\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco answers him with an amused, \u201cmaybe we do.\u201d</p>\n<p>It makes Harry give a small laugh.\u00a0</p>\n<p>One by one, the students are called out by Minerva Mcgonagall. One Hufflepuff here, one Ravenclaw over there, a Gryffindor here and a Slytherin there. On and on it goes, until Hermione Granger is called. The bushy haired girl sits on the stool for a long while, much like she had the first time. Harry waits for the hat to shout Gryffindor, but when it opens its mouth to speak, it releases a yell of, \u201cRAVENCLAW!\u201d</p>\n<p>With an open mouth, Harry claps along with the students. What\u2019s going on? Why wasn\u2019t Hermione in Gryffindor? Granted, she would probably do better in Ravenclaw, but <em> still.\u00a0</em>This was confusing. And weird.</p>\n<p>After a while, Draco Malloy struts to the front. The hat barely touches his blonde hair before it bellows out a, \u201cSLYTHERIN!\u201d</p>\n<p>A few minutes later, Ron hesitantly takes a seat on the stool. The hat is placed onto his ginger hair. Harry sees Ron mouthing words, but he can\u2019t quite make them out. It isn\u2019t really much of a surprise when the hat twists the corners of its supposed mouth and reluctantly yells out, \u201cHUFFLEPUFF!\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry claps the loudest when Ron gives a blinding smile and happily makes his way towards the table of yellow and black. Somewhere in the back, Harry hears a perfectly timed, \u201cThat\u2019s our Ron!\u201d It\u2019s definitely from the twins.</p>\n<p>Professor Mcgonagall skims her eyes over her piece of parchment. \u201cHarry Potter,\u201d she voices softly.</p>\n<p>Dumbledore leans closer over the high table, peering down at the first years with twinkling eyes.</p>\n<p>Harry steps up, ready to overthrow everyone\u2019s game.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<b>Chapter Ten:</b>\n</p>\n<p><em> \u201cI can explain,\u201d </em> is the first thing that Harry says once the sorting hat is placed over his head.\u00a0</p>\n<p>For a few seconds, the hat stays silent. And then it laughs, wheezy and incredulous. <em> \u201cHarry Potter,\u201d </em> it breathes out, <em> \u201cthe boy-who-lived. Oh, the irony.\u201d\u00a0 </em></p>\n<p>Harry rolls his green eyes. <em> \u201cVery funny,\u201d </em>he mutters.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The sorting hat gives a long, low and thoughtful hum. \u201c<em>Though</em><em> the boy-who-dimensionally-time-travelled is more fitting. On the other hand, it\u2019s quite a mouthful. Perhaps the boy-who-keeps-on-living? The boy-who-can\u2019t-die? The boy-who-leaped-through-time? The boy who\u2014\u201d </em></p>\n<p><em> \u201cWait, wait. The boy-who-what? Dimensionally time travelled?\u201d </em> Harry cuts in, tone bewildered. <em> \u201cIs, is that even a thing?\u201d\u00a0 </em></p>\n<p><em> \u201cMy, my\u2026 what house to put you in?\u201d </em> The hat muses, completely ignoring Harry\u2019s question and averting the conversation in a different direction all together. <em> \u201cYou\u2019re brave, you\u2019re loyal, cleverness is definitely hiding somewhere in there\u2014\u201d </em></p>\n<p><em> \u201cRude! And don\u2019t just ignore my question!\u201d </em>Harry chimes in.\u00a0</p>\n<p><em> \u201c\u2014And you still have a thirst to prove yourself. Well, you definitely can\u2019t escape your true house this time, Mr. Potter.\u201d </em>Pausing, the old hat then announces, \u201cSLYTHERIN!\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Harry takes the hat off himself and passes it to a surprised Mcgonagall. She takes the hat with shaky fingers and wide eyes, mumbling a barely there, \u201cthank you,\u201d that pierces the booming silence in the great hall. At once, there is awkward but polite clapping from Dumbledore that everyone then reciprocates. There\u2019s even a chorused shout from the Gryffindor table, \u201cWe didn\u2019t get Potter! We didn\u2019t get Potter!\u2019\u2019 It makes Harry smile as he makes his way down to the table of green and silver and takes a seat beside Draco.</p>\n<p>There are a few others who get sorted after Harry and once that\u2019s done, Dumbledore gives his usual odd speech with a warning. \u201cAnd finally, I must tell you that this year, the third-floor corridor on the right-hand side is out of bounds to everyone who does not wish to die a very painful death.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWonderful,\u201d Harry grumbles under his breath, remembering the fiasco that the philosopher\u2019s stone had brought him the first time. Beside him, Draco snorts.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Dumbledore waves a hand and the tables start piling up with dishes of all sizes. There are main courses and side dishes, chicken and gravy, Yorkshire puddings and sausages, cottage pie and many, many others. Harry spies treacle tart and places two pieces of the fine dessert onto his plate. It might not be the healthy choice, but, well, Harry doesn\u2019t exactly care.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHarry Potter in Slytherin,\u201d a girl voices somewhere from Draco\u2019s side. Her black hair is short, touching just the edges of her jawline. Harry thinks her name might be Pansy Parkinson. \u201cWhat a turn of events.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNot really,\u201d Harry says. He stabs his fork into his cake and then brings it towards his mouth. The treacle tastes like heaven. It\u2019s rich and creamy and makes his taste buds tingle. Harry has a weakness for them. He internally vows that treacle tart is the best dessert he\u2019s ever had. For a few moments, the flavour takes away his worries.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Before he even knows it, Harry and the other first years are being taken down into their common rooms. The trip down to the dungeons is quiet, but there\u2019s a hiss from Draco\u2019s robes that tells him that Nimmy is cold. The entrance to the common room is located behind a bare stretch of stone wall in the dungeons. The tiny, intricate snake carved into the top left corner is the only thing that separates this wall from many of the other ones down in the dungeons.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe password is Viper.\u201d The Head Girl announces. Her hair is a dull shade of ginger and her eyes are sunken, with deep purple bruises underneath them. As soon as the password leaves her lips, the stone wall swings open to reveal the Slytherin common room. The Head Boy motions for them to follow in. He too has dull orange hair and sunken eyes.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Harry and the other first years follow the Head Girl And Head Boy inside. The room is long with rough stone walls and a low ceiling. Greenish lamps hang by chains and a fire cracks under an elaborately carved mantelpiece. There are curved chairs and plush, green sofas. Everything is overlooked by a glass wall that showcases the deep waters of the black lake.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Once the dorms are pointed out, Harry and the others take themselves up spiral stairs and into long corridors.</p>\n<p>Draco stops in front of a door that has his name along with Harry\u2019s and two others carved elegantly in silver against black wood. \u201cWe\u2019re in here.\u201d He says. The blonde fixes his expression into one of utter boredom that looks\u2026 oddly\u2026 er\u2026 Pureblood? For the lack of better words. Harry sort of wishes he could pull of the same expression. He peers over Draco\u2019s shoulder to read the other two names. There\u2019s someone by the name of Theodore Nott. Harry doesn\u2019t quite remember him. He does however, remember Blaise Zabini.</p>\n<p>With a hum, Harry ushers Draco through the door. Their room is large, with four single poster beds that are spaced out evenly. There are green covers with silver linings, black pillows that are fluffed up to perfection. Each bed has a bedside table, it\u2019s wooden and the same shade of their door. Harry spots his trunk at the end of a bed. It\u2019s beside a single vertical window that goes from the bottom of the carpeted floor to the top of the stone ceiling. It\u2019s like a smaller version of the glass wall in the common room. Harry stares into the darkness of the window but doesn\u2019t see anything.</p>\n<p>The next morning, after Harry gets little to no sleep, he heads down with his dorm mates to the common room. Professor Snape is stood by the entrance, handing out papers. The first years schedule, no doubt.</p>\n<p>\u201cLet\u2019s hope our first lesson isn\u2019t with the Gryffindors.\u201d Blaise mutters as he shoulders past Harry. Nott follows after him, right at the other males heels.</p>\n<p>\u201cI get the feeling that they don\u2019t exactly like me,\u201d Harry grumbles, rubbing his shoulder. Nimmy bumps her little head against his cheek in a show of reassurance from where she\u2019s sat on his shoulder.</p>\n<p>\u201cIgnore them,\u201d Draco smoothes out his robes with his hands as they walk. \u201cOnly start noticing them when they decide to stop acting like children.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cRight.\u201d Harry nods. He can\u2019t help but think that Draco is also just a child. Ironic, that he would say such a thing.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s Professor Snape by the way.\u201d Draco adds, voice barely above a whisper as they reach said man. \u201cHe\u2019s our head of house.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAh. Malfoy,\u201d Snape greets Draco with a dip of his head. Draco returns the motion and then accepts his schedule from the dark haired Professor. He stands to the side, waiting for Harry.</p>\n<p>Snape moves his gaze onto Harry and his dark eyes narrow, flashing with animosity. \u201cPotter,\u201d he says flatly. Harry forces a smile. It\u2019s too big. Too bright. Too fake. But he can\u2019t bring himself to care. He feels as if every inch of his skin is prickling, like he suddenly doesn\u2019t belong in his own skin. Snape raises his gaze ever so slightly and his brows furrow, his lips dipping into a deep scowl.</p>\n<p><em> \u201cMaster,\u201d </em> Nimmy hisses quietly, <em> \u201cyour hair\u2026 it\u2019s blue.\u201d </em></p>\n<p>Confused, Harry reaches for a lock of his hair and tries to pull it forward so he can see it. True to Nimmy\u2019s words, his hair is blue. Pastel and beaming. <em> \u201cAw, fuck. I was glad to have my own hair back and now this?\u201d </em> He whines. <em> \u201cAnd why blue of all colours?\u201d </em></p>\n<p><em> \u201cIf it\u2019s any consolation,\u201d </em> Nimmy climbs onto Harry\u2019s head and nestles herself between his colourful hair, <em> \u201cI think it\u2019s much better than the pink.\u201d </em></p>\n<p>Snape\u2019s black eyes are wide, unblinking as he stares at Harry. His eyebrows keep raising themselves higher and higher, until they disappear into his hairline. There\u2019s a twitch and an odd curve to his lips that sort of looks like a pained smile. It reminds Harry of Lucius\u2019 reaction to hearing him speak parseltongue. He too looked like everything he had fought for had suddenly slipped through his fingers.</p>\n<p>Heaving a sigh, Harry can\u2019t help but ask, \u201cIt\u2019s the hair, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p>\n<p>At the side, Draco smothers a laugh into his hand.\u00a0</p>\n<p>It sort of sounds like he\u2019s choking.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>Chapter Eleven:\u00a0</b>\n</p>\n<p>\u201cThe look on his face was priceless,\u201d Draco grins. There\u2019s a small hop to his steps as they walk towards the great hall, like he\u2019s happy about that particular predicament. His eyes stray to Harry's blue hair. \u201cIf you keep surprising everyone like this, it\u2019s going to be one hell of a year.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Harry can\u2019t help but sigh. He mutters a quiet, \u201cwhy couldn\u2019t my hair just stay black?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Draco snickers loudly. He quietens down when he spots something or rather <em> someone </em> in the distance. His lips quirk up into a smirk, his whole expression radiating smugness. Harry follows the blondes line of sight, only to see Ron stood at the end of the hallway, fidgeting with his black and yellow robes.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Amused, Harry halts to a stop and asks, \u201cYou feel pretty proud about that, don\u2019t you?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Feigning an air of innocence, Draco lifts his head a little higher and stops as well. \u201cAre you trying to imply something?\u201d He asks.</p>\n<p>Harry snorts. Internally, he thinks, <em> only that you like the fact that you influenced Ron enough for him to be in Hufflepuff. </em>He doesn\u2019t dare to say it out loud, lest Draco get mad. \u201cNothing,\u201d he answers instead, his voice bordering on teasing. He can\u2019t help but let a smile slip.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Draco looks like he wants to say something, a remark probably, but he gets suddenly cut off when Ron literally tackles him down to the ground. Harry watches with raised eyebrows as the two fall down. Draco lets out an \u2018oof\u2019 as he falls on his arse. Ron falls on top of him, half on the ground and half in the other boys lap. He\u2019s beaming, wide and bright. \u201cHey,\u201d he greets, out of breath.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re crazy.\u201d Draco says, grey eyes wide as he finds his bearings. He tries to shoo Ron off his lap, there\u2019s a scowl on his lips and a red tint to his cheeks. \u201cYou can\u2019t just\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Ron interrupts, voice sincere and expression soft as he places his hand over the Hufflepuff logo on his robes. There are crinkles beside his brown eyes and a warmth in his smile.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Draco just stares at him dumbly, completely caught off guard.</p>\n<p>Harry feels like he\u2019s interrupting a moment again. Here he was, the boy-who-third-wheeled. Clearing his throat, Harry catches both Ron\u2019s and Draco\u2019s attention simultaneously. \u201cAre you two done?\u201d He asks. \u201cThere\u2019s treacle tart waiting for me and I don\u2019t want to be held up any longer by your, er, <em> thing.</em>\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>At once, the boys on the floor turn red.\u00a0</p>\n<p>A little later, while Harry enjoys his morning share of treacle tart, Draco refuses to make eye contact with him whenever he talks. Nimmy tells him it\u2019s because he\u2019s embarrassed. Harry\u2019s grin is wolfish when he points it out to Draco and the blonde splutters over his words. He denies anything and everything. Harry isn\u2019t even surprised. He isn\u2019t surprised by the wide eyed stares other students send his way either. His blue hair is making everyone take a double take.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Their first lesson turns out to be Transfiguration. A simple turn this matchstick into a needle and then vice versa. Harry does his on the first try and then feels guilty when the rest of the class doesn\u2019t quite get it. Draco, who\u2019s sitting beside him, has turned his match into only half a needle. There\u2019s a dip between his blonde brows and a concentrating curl to his lips. Harry\u2019s green eyes wander around the room until they stop on Hermione. She\u2019s getting praised by Mcgonagall. It\u2019s not a surprise to know that Hermione has also turned her match into a needle on her first try. There\u2019s a small smile on her lips, pleased but polite. Her eyes on the other hand, have a weird sort of\u2026 hunger in them. Like she\u2019s not quite satisfied. Harry watches her for the rest of the lesson.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Charms with Professor Flitwick is spent trying to make a feather float. This time, Harry waits until Hermione is the first one to make hers float before he makes his own fly gently over his head. Draco\u2019s own feather stays level with his eyes but doesn\u2019t move any higher. Ron, who\u2019s sat behind Hermione, can only get his feather to lift itself a mere inch of the desk. He mumbles something quietly to himself and slumps his shoulders in defeat.\u00a0</p>\n<p>With a roll of her eyes, Hermione says just loudly enough for Harry to overhear, \u201cit\u2019s leviOsa not leviosA.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Huffing out a puff of air, Ron waves his wand and pronounces the spell the right way. His feather shoots up towards the ceiling, way past any others in the room. Ron stares after it in awe, positivity beaming. Hermione stares at Ron with narrowed eyes and a clenched fist.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Harry merely observes.\u00a0</p>\n<p>During history of magic, Harry takes a well-deserved nap. He had been up all night after all. Flashes of red eyes and a cunning smile were all that he could see every time he closed his eyes, but now, it\u2019s nothing. Just darkness. He wakes up when Nimmy nudges him awake with her snout and tells him there\u2019s a mere five minutes left. He spends those last few minutes stroking her red and yellow scales, gaze held on Verde who\u2019s nestled in Ron\u2019s orange hair just a few seats ahead. The green and black snake is hissing quietly to himself, something about nosy rabbits and whatnot. Harry will have to ask him later about it.\u00a0</p>\n<p>In Defence against the Dark Arts, Harry along with the rest of the class fail to keep up with the stuttering Quirrell. Taking the notes that he can, Harry idly wonders about Voldemort. You see, Harry has a disease he can\u2019t quite get rid off. It\u2019s called a saving people thing. No matter how much Harry tries not to give a fuck and forget about eveything, the saviour in him just\u2026 comes out. He knows he shouldn\u2019t be helping Voldemort. That noseless asshat had killed his parents after all. And would eventually kill even more. Worrying his bottom lip, Harry absentmindedly caresses his scar. There\u2019s a gentle hum, like a quiet pulse, but other than that there\u2019s nothing. Smiling, Harry muses over giving Voldemort the philosopher\u2019s stone.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Pausing, Harry stills his quill over his parchment.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Hang on.\u00a0</p>\n<p>What would happen if Harry <em> did </em> give Voldy the philosopher\u2019s stone? Chaos, undoubtedly. With his potter luck, probably even an earlier War. Feeling his smile grow, Harry goes back to writing notes and plotting demise.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He avoids making eye contact with Quirrell during the lesson, even when his voice slowly starts evening out and lowers into a tone Harry knows all too well. He ignores the shiver it sends running down his spine and the fiery anticipation it burns through his veins. It lasts for a whole minute before Quirrell goes back to stuttering.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The weird feeling that settles over Harry\u2019s chest doesn\u2019t leave him until much later.\u00a0</p>\n<p><br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>Chapter Twelve:\u00a0</b>\n</p>\n<p>Maybe using his knowledge from the Half-Blood Prince book was a bad idea. But, well, Harry really just couldn\u2019t find any fucks to give. Besides, it was fun to watch a dip form between Snape\u2019s brows and his lips to thin as he overlooked Harry\u2019s potion. He\u2019d make this weird noise, a mix between a grunt and a sigh and then he\u2019d stare at Harry from behind his desk with his hands steepled underneath his chin. Almost like he was on edge. He\u2019d occasionally ask questions, which in fact only fourth years and up would know the answers to (perhaps Hermione did too, but Harry wouldn\u2019t know. He\u2019s not talked to her yet) and Harry would simply pretend he didn\u2019t know. He\u2019d shrug his shoulders and watch as silent frustration built itself behind Snape\u2019s dark eyes.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Sometime later, Snape finally caves in and asks why Harry is crushing instead of slicing. It\u2019s a simple potion, all first year potions are simple, actually. Harry just likes to complicate his own and everyone else's lives. \u201cI\u2019m not sure,\u201d he answers quietly, watching the mint green potion swirl in his cauldron. \u201cIt just feels right, is all.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Snape doesn\u2019t bother with asking him anymore questions. He doesn\u2019t stop staring though. Especially when Nimmy and Verde are in his class as well. Nimmy isn\u2019t all that chatty during lessons, but Verde likes to sing songs that he\u2019s overheard from Ron. Snape is always telling Harry off for it. It\u2019s kind of funny actually, because it seems like Snape (along with Draco and Ron) is the only one that doesn\u2019t tense around his familiars and run for the hills. There is, however, always a crease above his furrowed brows whenever he spots Nimmy lounged over Harry\u2019s textbook or Verde nestled in Ron\u2019s orange hair.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Harry calls it a win.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Nimmy says she doesn\u2019t quite agree.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The next few weeks are spent normally. Harry goes to his lessons, visits Hedwig in the schools owlery, spends his time in the library and generally acts as a safe zone between Draco and Ron. Draco\u2019s still a little\u2026 well, <em> Draco.\u00a0</em>Everytime Draco so much as says something a little <em> off </em> or mean or snobbish, Ron\u2019s face falls and he looks like he had been given a puppy and then denied to be let to pet it. The incident is usually followed by Ron keeping a safe distance and Draco whining about it to Harry at breakfast, lunch and tea.</p>\n<p>This time it isn\u2019t any different.</p>\n<p>\u201c...and he knows I didn\u2019t really mean it.\u201d Draco sighs dramatically, leaning his chin into the palm of his hand. He uses his other hand to absentmindedly swirl his spoon through his chicken soup.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Harry makes a little humming sound, Draco\u2019s words going in one ear and out the other. He\u2019s too busy enjoying his afternoon portion of treacle tart. It\u2019s absolutely perfect. Top notch.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2014arry! Harry! Are you even listening to me?\u201d</p>\n<p>Blinking, Harry pauses mid bite and turns to a grouchy looking Draco. He raises a brow in silent question.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNevermind.\u201d Draco shakes his head, \u201cI don\u2019t want to know.\u201d He then shoves his soup away and stands to his feet. With a grumble, he turns and leaves.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhere\u2019s he off to, again?\u201d Daphne Greengrass asks from Harry\u2019s left. She pushes a stray lock of blonde hair behind her ear and frowns.</p>\n<p>Pansy Parkinson rolls her eyes from the right. \u201cOh please,\u201d she blows out a puff of air to move her fringe out of her eyes, \u201che\u2019s obviously going to go see his <em> boyfriend </em>.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, you know?\u201d Harry tilts his head to the side. \u201cGranted, it\u2019s obvious. I just didn\u2019t think anyone of us would voice it.\u201d He reaches for another treacle tart, ignoring the strangled noise Greengrass makes.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Parkinson cackles and catches the attention of a few other Slytherin students.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s so funny?\u201d Theodore Nott turns towards them with curiosity.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Parkinson gives a predatory grin. \u201cWe\u2019re just talking about Malfoy and his\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBoyfriend,\u201d Nott cuts in and turns his line of sight towards the ceiling with a deep sigh. \u201cIt\u2019s always Weasley this and Weasley that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCan\u2019t wait for the wedding,\u201d Blaise Zabine mutters into his goblet. There\u2019s a hint of seriousness to his words that has their side of the table falling to silence.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Greengrass clears her throat. \u201cThey can\u2019t,\u201d she says, her frown deepening, \u201cMalfoy is to wed my younger sister.\u201d There\u2019s a particular finality to her words that has Harry stabbing his fork into his treacle tart with a scowl.</p>\n<p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t worry about it Potter,\u201d Parkinson shuffles closer to him, placing her elbow against his own on the table, \u201cthere\u2019s many ways to get little Astoria out of the picture.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cMaybe you should ask Zabini,\u201d Tracy Davis says quietly from behind her thick tome, \u201chis mother\u2019s a black widow, after all.\u201d</p>\n<p>Parkinson gives a cruel snicker and hides her face into her hands to smother her laughter.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Zabini merely narrows his eyes, lips falling into a thin, displeased line.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Smiling, Harry can\u2019t help but think the baby death eaters are starting to warm up to him. Or maybe he\u2019s just imagining it. Either way, it doesn\u2019t seem <em> that </em> bad.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Later, after double Charms and a game of <em> \u2018how many times can I roll my eyes before Draco grabs Ron by the shoulders and professes his love to him,\u2019 </em>Harry sets off towards the owlery.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHello, beautiful.\u201d Harry can\u2019t help but grin as he strokes Hedwig's soft feathers. The owl nips at his dark hair affectionately and gives a hoot or two. \u201cI know, I know,\u201d Harry murmurs, pressing his face into his familiars white coat, \u201cI promise you\u2019ll get to fly with letters real soon. I have a pen pal in mind. You\u2019ll have to be careful though, he\u2019s got a few anger issues.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>That night Harry dreams of Sirius falling through the veil. He dreams of Pettigrew cutting of his own arm. And when Cedric crawls out of the cauldron instead of Voldermort, Harry wakes up with a start. His skin feels clammy and his heart is thundering behind his ribcage, his breaths are quick and short, loud to his own ears. There\u2019s a lump in the back of his throat. Harry eyes the drapes obscuring his bed with distrust.\u00a0</p>\n<p><em> \u201cMaster?\u201d </em> Nimmy raises her little head from her side of the pillow. The tone of her voice is worried.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Flinching, Harry forces his nerves to calm down. He forces his heart to not beat so quickly, or at least he tries to, it only ends with his chest clenching and aching painfully. <em> \u201cFine,\u201d </em> he fumbles with the bed covers, wrapping his fingers tightly into the silky material for some sort of purchase. <em> \u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d\u00a0 </em></p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t sleep. Instead, he keeps his gaze steady on his dark drapes. He feels like there might be death eaters lurking in the curves and dips of the drapes, waiting for Harry to fall asleep just so that they can kill him.</p>\n<p>Harry doesn\u2019t shake the feeling away, not even when he sits down for breakfast the next morning.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you alright, Harry?\u201d Draco asks, words quiet and careful. He leans closer, ducking his head to get a better view of his friend.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Harry breathes out after realising that he had actually paused to think about it. He shakes his head to clear his thoughts. \u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d he nods.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Draco doesn\u2019t look the bit convinced. \u201cIf you say so.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Whatever.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Harry doesn\u2019t care about his nightmares. He cares about getting Sirius out of Azkaban, about somehow making Hermione his friend again, about getting the philosopher\u2019s stone and literary giving it to Voldemort so he can achieve his dream of immortality and stop bitching about it.\u00a0</p>\n<p>It might take a while, but Harry\u2019s already chosen what he wants. There\u2019s no stopping him now.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<b>Chapter Thirteen:\u00a0</b>\n</p>\n<p>Giving the philosopher's stone to Voldemort seems\u2026 oddly easy. In fact, Harry could literally just slip a note to Quirrelmort about it and be on his way. He doesn\u2019t even have to go on some obscure adventure to get the stone. Well, he probably should, considering he\u2019s under Dumbledore\u2019s watch. But then again, Harry doesn\u2019t really give a fuck about the old goat.\u00a0</p>\n<p>That\u2019s exactly why one cloudy and cold morning, Harry writes his impromptu letter out during DADA. Quirrell is at the front of the class, stumbling across his words and pointing out something on the chalkboard behind him. Ron is swinging his legs underneath the desk beside Harry, humming quietly as he takes notes. Verde and Nimmy are both lounging across the desk, arguing about who\u2019s scales are smoother and prettier. Nimmy seems to be winning. \u00a0</p>\n<p>Smiling, Harry dips his quill into his ink pot and begins to write. <em> \u2018Dear, Voldemort.\u2019 </em> Pausing, Harry tilts his head to the side in thought and then crosses out the two words. <em> \u2018Dear, Tom,\u2019 </em> he writes instead, <em> \u2018the philosophers stone is on third-floor corridor on the right-hand side, under a trap door. It\u2019s unfortunately guarded by a three headed dog. His name is fluffy and if you ignore the sharp fangs he\u2019s sort of cute. Kind of like you.\u2019 </em> Here, Harry taps the top end of his quill against his bottom lip. He shifts in his seat and leans closer to his desk, hunching across his parchment so it looks like he\u2019s taking notes. Behind him, Draco murmurs something to Parkinson that makes her snort. Hovering his quill above his parchment, Harry continues to write. <em> \u2018When you come to the end of the obstacles, you\u2019ll get to an empty room with a mirror. It will only give the stone to someone who wants to find it but not to use it.\u2019 </em> He underlines the word \u2018find\u2019 several times, just in case old Voldy might not quite understand. He signs it with a simple, <em> \u2018with love, HP.\u2019 </em></p>\n<p>Harry spends the rest of the lesson drawing little hearts all over the letter, imagining the disgusted face of Quirrelmort as he reads over it. It makes him giddy.\u00a0</p>\n<p>At the end of the class, Harry makes his way towards the owlery. He could have easily just left the letter on Quirell\u2019s desk without anyone knowing, innocent in its blank envelope. Except, Harry has the gnawing feeling that Hedwig is going to be very upset with him if he doesn't finally give her a letter to fly with. With a sigh, Harry ties the letter around Hedwig\u2019s leg. She hoots at him excitedly, her eyes shining. Harry can\u2019t help but smile. \u201cAlright, girl. Don\u2019t let anyone except V see you.\u201d Hedwig gives him a confirming hoot and then flies off, gracefully tilting out of one of the many windows.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Apparently Voldemort decides to wait for his hunt for the Philosopher\u2019s stone. He stays at Hogwarts, keeps teaching Defense and every now and then he\u2019ll look towards Harry and his eyes will flash red. It always leaves a thrum of anticipation running through Harry, his scar humming and his stomach fluttering with butterflies. It\u2019s confusing, because he\u2019s used to his scar burning and bleeding and hurting in agony whenever Voldy so much as looks at him. He\u2019s not used to this\u2026 weird but pleasant hum. Like he\u2019s happy at the attention Voldemort is giving him. During one of the demonstrations, Voldemort keeps his gaze on him, his voice evens out, lowering into a tone Harry knows all too well and his eyes flash red. It makes Harry swallow dryly, his hair suddenly turning pink. It\u2019s not the usual bubblegum pink that makes you want to claw your eyes out either. This pink is softer, much lighter, more\u2026<em>something</em> Harry refuses to name. Instead of questioning it, he pays it no mind and goes on with his day. By the end of the week, his hair is back to its normal dark colour.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Halloween arrives rather quickly. Pumpkins are carved with wide smiles, Muggleborns are in their element, there are hoards of sweets and candles are charmed to float above their heads. The Weasley twins explode a glitter bomb in one of the corridors just a day before the feast and the Professors try their hardest to keep everything in one piece. Harry sees McGonagall stalking around the great hall the next day with a serious face, her robes keep changing into bright colours and by the loud laughter from the Gryffindor table, he knows it\u2019s another one of the Weasley twins pranks. Dumbledore gives one of his short speeches, stifling a laugh as McGonagall takes her usual seat and then the Halloween feast is started.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHarry,\u201d Ron whispers, voice hesitant. He tugs on the side of Harry\u2019s robes, anxiously biting his bottom lip. He\u2019s sat beside him at the Slytherin table, his yellow robes sticking out in a sea of green and silver.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHmm?\u201d Harry hums, eyeing the pumpkin pie with an unimpressed frown. His usual dose of treacle tart isn\u2019t anywhere in sight. It\u2019s actually quite upsetting. Just because it\u2019s Halloween doesn\u2019t mean that they can switch out all the treacle tart for pumpkin pie. He turns to face Ron with a disappointed sigh.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy am I sat here?\u201d Ron mumbles out the words, his cheeks lightly dusting pink in embarrassment. \u201cI should be with the other Hufflepuffs.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Feeling the corners of his lips tug into a smirk, Harry moves his line of sight down the Slytherin table. Draco is sat beside Nott and Zabini, his chin is placed in the palm of his hand and he\u2019s gazing at Ron longingly. There had been another lovers quarrel not long ago. Ron had overheard Draco say something rude about his new friends, Seamus Finnigan and Dean Thomas. So, for the past few days Ron has been keeping his distance from Draco.</p>\n<p>\u201cBecause I want you here,\u201d Harry shrugs. He pulls a tray of shortbread biscuits closer to them, figuring they\u2019ll have to take over his treacle tart obsession for the day. He motions for Ron to take one and he does, biting into the soft biscuit and warily eyeing the other students sat around them.\u00a0</p>\n<p>On Harry\u2019s left, Davis is reading a thick tome, clearly disinterested in her surroundings. Sat beside her, Greengrass is openly glaring at Ron, ignoring whatever her friend is trying to tell her. Crab and Goyle are stuffing their faces with suspiciously orange coloured muffins a few seats lower. On Harry\u2019s right, just a seat away from Ron, Parkinson is blowing a bubble of gum. It pops loudly, sticking to her lips. She licks it off, twirling a lock of her short, black hair between her pale fingers as she waits for something exciting to happen.\u00a0</p>\n<p>When Harry turns his gaze back to Ron, there are crumbs at the side of his lips. A candle floats just above him, the orange flame sending a warm glow across Ron\u2019s features and brightening his hair momentarily. Harry is wiping away the crumbs before he even knows it. Ron\u2019s lips are very soft under the pad of his thumb. Harry watches as Ron\u2019s brown eyes widen, he blushes right up to the tips of his ears. It\u2019s cute.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThere,\u201d Harry says, pulling away.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThanks,\u201d Ron mutters weakly, ducking his head to hide his red face.\u00a0</p>\n<p>It startles a laugh out of Parkinson who bangs her first against the table. Her goblet tips to the side, spilling its contents. She doesn\u2019t seem to care, it only spurs on her laughter.</p>\n<p>Raising a brow, Harry chances a glance towards Draco. The blonde looks like a kicked puppy. Zabini pats his back reassuringly and Nott rolls his eyes, mouthing the words, \u2018save me.\u2019\u00a0</p>\n<p>Harry snorts, hiding his laugh into the palm of his hand. And when Ron looks at him with confusion, he promises to tell him later.\u00a0</p>\n<p>It\u2019s not until Harry is nestled under his covers, Nimmy asleep on the pillow beside his own, that he realises that he\u2019s forgotten about the anniversary of his parents death. For a few moments, he feels sort of\u2026 dislodged from the world, and then he\u2019s throwing off his covers and going through his trunk.\u00a0</p>\n<p>While Nott is fast asleep, Draco is still up, writing an essay for charms that he had forgotten about. Zabini is checking on his Herbology project, watering it and making sure the soil is wet enough. They both turn to look at him, but Harry ignores them in favour of pulling out a red coloured candle. It smells like apples, nice and sweet. There\u2019s a rune carved professionally into it \u2014 it stands for life after death. He places it onto his bedside table and lights it up with a murmured spell. For a few seconds, Harry just watches the candle burn, sat on his knees in front of it. Whatever memories Harry has of his parents, they\u2019re bittersweet at best. He can\u2019t think of anything good to tell them.\u00a0</p>\n<p><em> \u201cMaster?\u201d </em>Nimmy voices tiredly, coming closer to the edge of the bed. She makes a sound equivalent to a human\u2019s yawn.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Harry smiles.<em>\u00a0\u201cSorry. Did I wake you up?\u201d </em></p>\n<p>Nimmy nods her head. Her tongue slithers out to taste the air. <em> \u201cAre you alright?\u201d\u00a0 </em></p>\n<p>Instead of answering her, Harry flutters his green eyes closed and holds his hands together in front of his face. He whispers a quiet, \u201cI\u2019ll promise to do better this time,\u201d and then blows out the candle. Gentle smoke rises from the stem, Harry inhales the scent of apples. It\u2019s sort homey. His scar hums, as if in agreement. When he gets back under the covers, Nimmy cuddles up to him as best as she can.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Harry is very glad when morning comes and neither Draco nor Zabini mention the events of last night. He sits down for breakfast, breathing out a relieved sigh as he finds his usual serving of treacle tart. He digs straight into it, moaning when his taste buds tingle. He\u2019s missed it, the taste of treacle tart. It\u2019s official. Harry doesn\u2019t think he can live without it. Parkinson seems to agree, because she slides her own own portion of treacle tart towards him. \u201cThanks, Pansy,\u201d Harry grins, green eyes shining.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNo problem, Po\u2014 <em> Harry.</em>\u201d Pansy gives a small smile.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Greengrass sits down, a furrow between her blonde brows. \u201cHas anyone seen Malfoy?\u201d She asks, looking up and down the table.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAt the Hufflepuff table,\u201d Davis answers from behind her book. She reaches for her buttered toast blindly and then brings it around her book and towards her mouth, eyes never leaving the text.</p>\n<p>Harry blinks and then slowly turns in his seat to take a look. Davis is right. Draco\u2019s silver and green robes stand out in the sea of Hufflepuffs. He\u2019s laughing at something that Ron says, crinkles appearing besides the corners of his grey eyes. Ron beams and says something else that catches Draco off guard. Must have been a compliment or something along the lines of that because he blushes and starts stammering. They look happy.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Greengrass on the other hand, doesn\u2019t.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Pansy shuffles closer to Harry, leaning in to whisper, \u201cshe looks more sour than a lemon.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<b>Chapter Fourteen:\u00a0</b>\n</p>\n<p>In the library there are soft murmurs and hushed conversations, every few seconds a page is turned over in a book and quills are scratched over parchments. In the corner of the library, tucked between two shelves, Harry sits with his chin placed in the palm of his hand, eyes slowly going over the words in his Astronomy book. Opposite him, Hermione Granger is reading some thick tome about poisonous plants \u2014 Neville Longbottom\u2019s doing, no doubt. Those two seemed to be\u2026 associates. Friends wasn\u2019t the right word to use for those two. Not yet, anyways.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Harry has been coming into the library every day for the past two weeks, exactly an hour after all classes have finished. He sits in the corner, joins Hermione in whatever she\u2019s doing, reading, writing, doing homework, sometimes he even takes an impromptu nap, much to the females dismay. They never talk. There\u2019s no greeting, no farewell, no nod of acknowledgement \u2014 just silence. Harry isn\u2019t sure what he\u2019s doing, but he knows he\u2019s doing it very, <em> very </em> well.</p>\n<p>It's times like these he wishes he wasn't so god damn socially awkward or that Hermione was more open about, well, <em> anything </em> really. It's sort of hypocritical coming from himself -- a pot calling the kettle black type of situation. The silence between them is also starting to slowly but surely kill him. Sighing, Harry pulls out a spare piece of parchment from his bag. He frowns when he notices that he must have left his quill in one of his classes. Placing the parchment over his Astronomy book, he leans across the table and grabs Hermione's quill - she doesn't notice, doesn't even glance up from her book, too absorbed in the tiny printed text -- so Harry taps the end of 'his' quill against his bottom lip in thought. And then it comes to him -- an absurd idea. An idea like no other.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Grinning, Harry sketches out a cartoonish version of his dear Voldy. He's the epitome of sass, one hand on his hip, the other one held up beside his face, his pointer finger swaying from side to side in a show of 'no.' He's dressed in his usual dark robes that billow and twirl around his legs. Snickering, Harry decides to add some thin but eccentric eyebrows and <em> oh </em>, he mustn't forget the hearts. He finishes it with a sign of his name. He holds back a laugh when he sees the finished piece. It brings a certain warmthness to his being that has him looking down at the parchment with fondness.\u00a0</p>\n<p>A giddy giggle passes from between his lips. He grabs another parchment and holds the stolen -- ahem, okay, <em> borrowed </em> -- quill over it, suddenly pausing. The ink drips down onto the yellowish paper and Harry blinks, slow and owlish. <em> Hold on, </em> he internalises. <em> Hold the fuck on. </em>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Why\u2026 why was he feeling all nice and shit\u2026 about\u2026 about\u2026</p>\n<p>Harry crushes the quill between his fingers. The black ink drips across the palm of his hand and he panics. \"Ah, fuck,\" he curses, hurriedly pushing his drawing of Voldemort out of the way, brows furrowed and expression slightly worried.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"Language,\" comes Hermione's voice, quiet and disinterested, gaze still held on her tome about poisonous plants.\u00a0</p>\n<p>For a moment, Harry is still and then he moves, shoulders hunching and lips forming a scowl. \"Language,\" he imitates, making his voice as bored as he can. He's not surprised, per say, he's\u2026 glad that Hermione has finally caved and opened her mouth to say something. Of course it would be about Harry's open use of curse words, though. His scowl deepens as he uses his non ink covered hand to stuff Cartoon-Voldy into his bag, out of sight, out of mind. He hopes.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"I'd rather like that quill back,\" Hermione's eyes move from left to right, reading the words in her book. \"<em> Fixed.\" </em>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Sighing, Harry concentrates his magic on the broken quill, it vibrates for a few seconds and then the broken pieces shift together and the ink runs back inside it. He places it down in front of Hermione, eyeing the way her hands form fists and her teeth bite at her lips in frustration.\u00a0</p>\n<p><em> Bingo </em>.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"It's not that hard,\" Harry says. \"All you have to do is concentrate on your magic and instead of letting your wand take over it, take over the magic yourself.\"</p>\n<p>Hermione finally raises her gaze, matching it with Harry's own. \"Take over...my magic?\" She asks, tone skeptical. \"Isn't it already <em> mine?\" </em></p>\n<p>\"Mhhm,\" Harry hums. \"I'm not really sure how to explain it better. It doesn't work the same way for everyone, you just need to find your own way of using wandless magic. Oh, but not everyone can do it nonverbally, so maybe you should start by saying the spell but not using a wand?\"</p>\n<p>Top lip curling in distastefully, Hermione returns her attention back to her tome, evidently no longer interested in a conversation.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>Smiling, Harry packs up his things, slings his bag over his shoulder and gets to his feet. \"I better check up on Ron and Draco, see if they're both still alive. Bye, 'Mione.\"\u00a0</p>\n<p>Harry tries his damn hardest not to laugh when he hears the girl choke, surprised and probably flustered.</p>\n<p>----</p>\n<p>For Christmas, Harry sends Hermione a book about magical cores. He also adds the first volume of, 'Are We Friends?' if only for a laugh. He gets Draco a new potions kit, filled with obviously illegal ingredients. Ron gets a vintage poster from the Chudley Cannons. Harry even gets a few gifts for his other friends. He gifts Pansy with a nice, silver bracelet that lights up whenever someone talks badly about her behind her back. This way, she'll know exactly who to hex. He gets Blaise a monthly subscription to, <em> 'How to Manage Murder </em> .' It's a lovely magazine, fits him quite perfectly actually. Theodore gets an assortment of special Christmas sweets that taste like <em> shit </em>and for Tracey, Harry decides on getting her basic hair clips. To hold back her bangs while she leans over her books and reads.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Finally, Harry decides on making Greengrass a cute photo of Draco and Ron holding hands as they walk down the corridors. There's a simple, <em> 'Sorry </em>,' written above them in loopy letters.</p>\n<p>It's Harry's most finest work to date, if he has to say so himself.</p>\n<p>The angry letter he receives on Christmas morning from the girl is something he expects. He barely pays attention to her carefully crafted words -- there's an insult almost in every line. Harry's quite proud of her, actually. He grades her letter with an <em> A </em> and sends it back to her, rumpled. She can obviously do better. A letter from her younger sister on the other hand, isn't something he'd been expecting at all. He lounges across his bed, flat on his stomach with his legs raised behind him, ankles crossed. Except for Nimmy and Verde curled up together on one of his pillows, the bedroom is empty. Draco, Theodore and Blaise had packed whatever they needed and then left to go home for the holidays.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Humming, Harry reads over the younger Greengrass's letter. Her words are smeared and there are blotches of ink around the parchment, so unlike her sister's. Perhaps the girl had been in a rush to write it? Or maybe she was genuinely a mess when it came to transferring her thoughts onto parchment, just like himself? Smiling, Harry realises the girl hadn't even managed to write a, <em> 'Dear Potter </em>,' simply preferring to jump straight into her musings.\u00a0</p>\n<p><em> 'Thank you for the cute picture! Daphne said she didn't like it and ended up throwing it away. I got curious and decided to save it. I've grown slightly attached to it and have perhaps pinned it up in my bedroom. </em> ' Here she crosses out several lines that Harry can't decipher. <em> 'I know it's rude of me to ask\u2026 but could you possibly make dracofallinlovewiththeweasleyquicker?'\u00a0 </em></p>\n<p>The letter then abruptly ends, almost as if she had been embarrassed to write anymore. Harry burrows his face into his hands and laughs.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Between dealing with his dear Voldy, trying to befriend Hermione and avoiding Dumbledore\u2026 Harry certainly had some free time to speed up the process of Draco falling further in love with Ron and vice versa. He could already imagine the chaos left in his wake - the utter dismay left on some people's faces. It makes him feel all giddy inside.\u00a0</p>\n<p><em> \"Master, you smell delighted.\" </em> Nimmy voices, slithering down the pillows and closer to him. <em> \"I'm not sure if I should be glad or worried.\" </em></p>\n<p><em> \"Worried?\" </em> Verde shakes his little head from side to side, <em> \"Please. Master knows what he's doing.\" </em> And then quietly, he adds, <em> \"I hope.\"\u00a0 </em></p>\n<p>Harry doesn't fall for the jibes, instead he reaches for his other Christmas presents. They're all spread around him. Some of them are neatly wrapped, others not so much. There are extravagant bows and glittering wrapping paper. Harry carefully opens the closest one to him, it's adored in orange polka dots. His heart swells when he peels apart the wrapping paper and sees a Weasley sweater. It's wooly and scratchy, dark green with a silver 'H' on the front. Harry blinks away his tears and quickly slips it on, relishing in the feeling of something <em> so </em> achingly familiar. There's a slip of paper between the wrapping and Harry picks it up, reading over Molly Weasley's neat handwriting.</p>\n<p>\n<em> 'Merry Christmas! Ron said you wouldn't mind a sweater, so I made you one as well. Hope you like it! - Molly Weasley.' </em>\n</p>\n<p>He does. Harry likes it very much. He awkwardly places the slip of paper onto one of his pillows and moves onto the rest of his gifts. From Hermione, he gets a special quill that apparently makes his chicken scratch look neater, much more readable. Draco gifts him an ever colour changing wand holder -- apparently to match his hair. He rolls his eyes fondly when he sees it. Ron gets him a nice a pair of gloves along with a scarf. His name is stitched into all the items, silvery and lopsided. Harry loves them.\u00a0</p>\n<p>From Pansy, he gets a large jar of Acid Pops. They all have insults carved into them. Blaise gifts him a subscription to, 'How to Manage Murder,' which Harry finds hilarious. Great minds think alike, after all. Theodore gets him the same assortment of <em> shit </em> sweets and surprisingly, Harry finds a pretty hair clip in his presents as well. It's from Tracey.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Two snakes curl around each other, one green and one red, their eyes are closed but their tongues are sticking out. Harry pulls his bangs back and clips them to the side.\u00a0</p>\n<p><em> \"What do you think?\" </em>He asks.\u00a0</p>\n<p><em> \"Pretty.\" </em>Nimmy and Verde answer simultaneously, not a hint of a lie tracing their voices.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Harry blushes. <em> \"Shut up,\" </em> he grumbles. He clears his throat and then goes for his last two presents. Undoubtedly, one is from Dumbledore. He's right, because he opens it and sees the same dumb note as the first time. He scrunches it up between his fingers and throws it across the room, not caring. The invisibility cloak is as soft as ever and Harry sighs, running his fingers up and down the silk like material. He carefully places it to the side and reaches for the last gift.\u00a0</p>\n<p>It's a small, velvet box.</p>\n<p>Curious, he gently pries it open. Inside lays a slip of parchment. And in loopy handwriting Harry knows all too well, the letters spell out a simple, <em> 'thank you.' </em>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em> Voldemort. </em>\n</p>\n<p>Feeling heat prickle at his skin, Harry pushes away the slip of parchment to see what's underneath it. His lips curl into a shaky grin when he finds a splinter of the Philosopher's stone.</p>\n<p>That night, Harry sleeps content with the knowledge that he's going to fuck up a lot of people's lives. Voldemort's present stays clutched in his hand.\u00a0</p>\n<p><br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n<b>Chapter Fifteen:\u00a0</b>\n</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Harry goes about his next few days in basic and boring fashion. He sleeps in until well after midday, listens to the constant bickering of Nimmy and Verde with a fond smile and somehow obtains an increasing amount of foolishly hand drawn images of Voldemort. They're all unique in their own way, portraying one thing or another about him in an amusing way. Harry has scribbled hearts all around them along with his signature on the corner of the parchment. He has them safely tucked away in the bottom of his trunk -- a secret to be kept from anyone else.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Along with that, Harry has been spending a suspicious amount of time holding a certain velvet box in his hands. He gazes at the red shard of the philosopher's stone inside it for hours on end, holds the box up between his fingers and lets the light hit it at a precise angle. The way the stone lights up and glints the same shade of red as Voldemort's eyes has his chest painfully aching.\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">And yet, he can't bring himself to stop doing it.\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\"<em>Master, you're doing it again.\"</em> Nimmy makes the snake equivalent sound to a sigh, as if she's disappointed. She drops her head down into Harry's duvet, her tongue flickering out to taste the air.\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Harry hums, lost in the way the Philosopher's shard changes colour depending on the way that he tilts it. Eventually, he asks, \"<em>Doing what?\"</em></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\"<em>Looking at the stone.\" </em>Nimmy huffs. \"<em>Avoiding eating food.\"\u00a0</em></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\"<em>Not paying enough attention to us,\"</em> Verde chimes in, slithering up to his sister.<em> \"The owl also brought you another letter. You haven't even spared it a glance yet.\"</em></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Blinking, Harry snaps the velvet box closed. He pockets it and turns around in his chair to look at them. <em>\"Hedwig brought me a letter and I didn't even realise?\"\u00a0</em></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\"<em>Well</em>,\" Nimmy pauses as she makes herself more comfortable, \"<em>She did nip at you a few times, you just didn't react.\"\u00a0</em></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\"<em>Too enamored by the stone,\"</em> Verde mutters in disdain.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\"<em>I'm not enamored,\" </em>Harry is quick to deny.\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">If Nimmy could roll her eyes, Harry is certain that she would. \"<em>Fine. Infatuated then. Whatever.\"</em></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Ignoring them, Harry turns away from his snakes and uses a tiny bit of his magic to beckon an innocent looking letter towards him from his bedside table. The moment he grasps it, he raises a single brow in silent question. The Malfoy crest sits over the middle of the envelope, silvery and perfect. Harry ruins it by snapping it open. The letter turns out to be an invitation to the Malfoy's annual Yule Ball.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Harry supposes he should go.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Since he's apparently allowed a plus one.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\"<em>So</em>,\" Harry turns his attention back to his snakes, a grin spreading across his lips, <em>\"I suppose you'd both like to see Draco and Ron?</em>\"\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">At once, both Nimmy and Verde start apologising for getting in the way of his time with the stone. Saying how normal it is. And how very proud of him they are. And how they could never hate him for who he is--</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Harry smothers them with nuzzles before they can say anything else.\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\"<em>Sometimes,\" </em>he murmurs, \"<em>it feels like I have two annoying children. But then I remember that I'm too young to have kids and everything's okay.\"</em></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Malfoy's ball is in less than two days. Harry sends Hermione a letter asking if she'd like to be his plus one. He also sends a letter to Draco saying that if he wants Ron to be at the ball then he's going to have to get him there himself.\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The next day, Harry is awoken by Verde and forced to get breakfast by Nimmy. He trudges into the great hall, hair messy and clothes rumpled. There are a handful of other students sat at their representative tables, five Ravenclaws, four Hufflepuffs, three Gryffindors. Other than himself at the Slytherin table, there are two others. The Head Boy and the Head Girl. Harry thinks their names might be Amycus and Alecto. The Carrow twins, if he's not mistaken. Harry hasn't been paying much attention to them, if any at all. They seem--</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\"<em>Master, the food.\"</em> Nimmy pokes her snout into his hand and Harry jumps, forced from out of his thoughts.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\"<em>Right,\"</em> he says, \"<em>food.\"</em></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">He forces himself to eat a bit of scrambled eggs. He's half way into his small portion when his stomach starts cramping from being full. Ah. Maybe Nimmy was right after all. He hadn't been eating properly since the hols had started. Perhaps he was too used to having his friends with him? They usually physically dragged him into the great hall and pushed food filled plates under his nose. No wonder Nimmy and Verde kept nagging at him.\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Harry rests his utensils across the table and starts slowly petting Nimmy's red scales. He uses his index finger to gently run across the bottom of her chin and she leans right into the touch, letting out a content little sigh.<em> \"Thank you,\" </em>he says, \"<em>for looking out for me.\"</em></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Across the table, Verde raises his head from being buried in a bowl of grapes with a loud gasp. He quickly slithers towards Harry, preening when his Master starts petting him too.\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">A few minutes later, Hedwig swoops down from many of the windows and lands on the edge of the table, letters attached to her leg. She sticks her leg out with a quiet hoot and Harry detaches the letters with ease. He feeds Hediwg a sausage or two and apologizes for ignoring her yesterday. She affectionately nips at his fingers before flying away.\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">One of the letters turns out to be from Hermione. It's short -- telling him off for such a short notice on such an <em>important</em> occasion. Harry reads the words in Hermione's sarcastic voice and can't help but laugh. Another letter is from Draco. It's a long paragraph about how unfair Harry is acting by not taking Ron to the Malfoy's Yule Ball and isn't that funny? Harry thinks it is. There's also a short note at the end of the parchment saying that Mrs Malfoy will come bright and early to pick him and his plus one up. Harry makes a mental note to relay the information to Hermione.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">With a smile, Harry settles Nimmy and Verde onto his shoulders and heads back to his dorm. He mulls between his thoughts and ends up resting against the backboard of his bed, knees pulled up to his chest, chin nestled on top of them while he fiddles with his velvet box. He turns it this way and that way, examining it even though he's already seen every crook and nanny.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\"<em>Perhaps it's a courting gift?\" </em>Nimmy voices quietly from the other end of the bed where she's lazing. The tone of her voice is oddly sour.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Verde's hiss is scandalous. <em>\"But, Master's too young for that!\"</em> He angrily moves around in a circle several times. \"<em>Once I find out who gave that weird box to him I'll wrap myself around their neck and choke them!\"</em></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Nimmy raises her little head and curls the tail end of her body around herself. \"<em>You're too small for that.\"</em> She points out.\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Pausing, Verde levels his sister with a glare. \"<em>S-shut up!\"</em> He shouts and then tackles Nimmy with a body slam.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\"<em>Ah! Get off! You're fat.\"\u00a0</em></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\"<em><b>You're</b></em><em> fat!\"</em></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n<em>\"Well you're fat <strong>AND</strong> stupid.\" </em>\n</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n<em>\"Master! She's bullying me again!\"</em>\n</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Snorting, Harry holds the velvet box closer to himself. \"A courting gift, huh?\" He feels the corners of his lips lift up into a wide smile. <em>No</em>, he thinks, <em>Voldemort would never.</em></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Courting gifts are usually necklaces and bracelets, brooches and bouquet flowers and the likes. Not whatever remained of the Philosopher's stone once it was used to restore someone's body.\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><em>Then again, </em>Harry internalises as he runs a thumb across the soft structure of the red stone, <em>Voldemort isn't like everyone else. So the same rules don't necessarily apply.</em></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">His wide smile softens into something smaller and his stomach flutters. Harry supposes he could make the shard into a simple necklace. Just so that it doesn't sit in its box in waste. Unbeknownst to him, his dark hair changes into the lightest shade of pink. So light, in fact, that it almost looks white.\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Harry spends the rest of the day crafting the shard to hold onto a thin piece of leathery string, making it look as presentable as possible - he's not quite satisfied with the outcome, but it will have to do for the time being.\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">When the awaited day comes, Harry stands in front of the full length mirror in the dorm bathroom and fixes his robes. They're a dark green colour, sort of forest-y with silver linings. The robes aren't too long or too short, they stop perfectly at his ankles. Harry goes through the pockets of his black slacks and pulls out a hairpin, the one that Tracey had gifted to him, and pins it onto the side of his messy and dark hair. The necklace that he had made hangs loosely around his neck, falls right just above the knot of his plain black tie. It glints whenever Harry so much as moves a step. Weirdly enough, that alone makes him feel light, like he's floating.\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\"<em>Master, what about the shoes?\"</em> Nimmy asks directly into his ear from where she's sprawled across his shoulder.\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Harry glances down at his converse. \"<em>What about them?\"\u00a0</em></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">He doesn't get an immediate answer. Verde snickers from his other shoulder and Nimmy relents with a quiet \"<em>nevermind</em>.\"\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">With a shrug, Harry glances at himself one more time and deems himself respectable. He then sets off towards his pre-discussed meeting place, head held high and energy buzzing at his fingertips.\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">He can't help but grin, wide and wolfish as he imagines all the chaos that he can undoubtedly do at the ball.\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Maybe he'll even embarrass Draco a bit, but that'll depend on his mood once he gets there.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">He just hopes his hair doesn't change colour.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Chapter Sixteen:\u00a0</b>\n</p>\n<p>As always the Malfoy's have outdone themselves. The walls are decorated with pretty and intricate snowflakes, ranging from tiny ones about the size of a hair's width to humongous ones the size of an average house -- they glint silver whenever you stare at them for a few seconds too long. Trees loom around them, pale and white and without any leaves. They are shiny and large and their thin twigs reach all the way up towards the archway of the ceiling. From the ceiling come lanterns shaped like stars, they glow dimly as they float about.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Children dressed in colourful robes and glittering ball gowns run around the hall, giggling loudly as they tumble around the strict adults. Behind them trail two tired looking maids, apologising to the guests as they do so.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tables are filled with rich food, sweet, salty, savoury -- Harry spots his beloved treacle tart on a beautiful silver tray and makes a beeline straight for it, only to be stopped short by a hand wrapping itself tightly around his wrist.</p>\n<p>\"Harry,\" Hermione sighs, long and deep, suffering really. \"Where do you think you're going?\"\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"'Mione,\" Harry says, turning back around to face the girl with a large smile. \"Have I mentioned how wonderful you look today?\" He asks, batting his eyelashes innocently.</p>\n<p>Hermione gives him a deadpan look, not quite believing him. It's the truth though. Her robes are pale, blue and purple. They're shiny and silk-like, held together by a silver clasp in the front that's shaped like a crown. Below her robes, Hermione is dressed in a nice, soft looking, baby blue coloured dress. It's short in the front and long at the back. There are purple butterflies gliding lazily across the blue material and when Hermione so much as moves, their wings flutter with life.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"Really,\" Harry let's his smile soften, his voice quiet between them, \"I'd say even breathtaking.\"</p>\n<p>Hermione flushes and ducks her head, the silver clips in her curly hair glinting with the movement.\u00a0 \"Alright. Alright.\" She grumbles, \"let's <em> politely </em> introduce ourselves to the Malfoy's and then I'll take you to the treacle tart.\"</p>\n<p>\"Yes ma'am.\"\u00a0</p>\n<p>Harry easily -- ahem, okay, <em> eagerly </em> -- tucks his arm around Hermione's and guides her from the overly large doors of the ball room towards the three Malfoy's stood at the greeting area just to the side of it. A small group of Wizards and Witches just finish their gossip with the trio when they duck their heads and head off into the ballroom.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The moment Draco spots them, the dead look in his eyes brightens with life. His expression flickers between excitement and\u2026 something that resembles worry.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Not batting an eye and sensing something off, Harry grins at him. He greets with a bow of his head, Hermione following his movements, \"Mr. Malfoy, Mrs. Malfoy, Dra-,\" his words get cut off as Draco engulfs both him and Hermione into a sudden and tight hug.\u00a0</p>\n<p><em> \"Not safe,\" </em>Draco hushes between them, voice muffled and words quick, grip momentarily tightening even more. He then quickly pulls back, a large grin plastered across his lips. \"Harry! Hermione! So glad the two of you could make it.\"</p>\n<p>Hermione blinks, a slow, confused flutter of her lashes and Harry leans into her side with a laugh, covering her expression from the older Malfoy's. \"Miss us that much, did you?\"\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"Apparently,\" Hermione rolls her eyes. \"Can't even go a few weeks without us, can you, Draco?\" She banters like she's been friends with the young Malfoy for years and <em> wow </em> , Harry is <em> so </em> proud of her for catching on.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Draco sticks his tongue out childishly and behind him, his mother clears her throat, eyes narrowing in a silent reprimand. Draco pauses and slowly steps back into his place with a low, \"Sorry, Mother.\"</p>\n<p>With a nudge from Hermione, Harry ducks his head once more in greeting. \"Thank you for the invitation,\" they chorus.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Mr. Malfoy, surprisingly, inclines his head. \"Thank you for coming,\" he says, silver eyes dropping to Harry's neck. His lips twitch when he spots Nimmy trying to poke her snout out from underneath Harry's robes, the red scales being hard to miss.</p>\n<p>Mrs. Malfoy also inclines her head. Her eyes stray to the snake clip in his hair as she speaks. \"Apologies for not being able to pick you up myself. Was the maid I sent sufficient enough?\"</p>\n<p>\"She was,\" Harry replies, barely remembering the maid. He watches in amusement as both Lucius' and Narcissa's gaze lowers to the shard of the Philosopher's stone that rests against the knot of his tie. In perfect synchronisation, the two Malfoy's freeze. Harry <em> swears </em> they have stopped breathing all together.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Their faces are set in complicated lines that he can't read<em> at all.\u00a0 </em></p>\n<p>Which, uh, <em> sucks. </em>Majorly. Because he'd really like to fucking know what's currently running through their minds, but <em> whatever </em>. Harry's just going to have to wing it, like he usually does.</p>\n<p>\"Happy Solstice,\" he smiles his bullshitting smile and ducks his head, ready to just get on with the ball. He tugs Hermione towards his beloved treacle tart, Narcissa's voice is awfully soft as it carries towards his ears. \"Happy Solstice,\" she repeats back at him.</p>\n<p>\"Enjoy the ball, Harry!\" Draco's voice is loud, the \"ow!\" he releases a second later is an octave higher.</p>\n<p>Harry turns his head ever so slightly, just about catching the sight of Draco rubbing a hand over his ear with a frown. He snorts.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"Well,\" Hermione gives an unimpressed frown, gesturing to the tables filled with yummy goods with her hand, \"get on with it, then.\"</p>\n<p>Not wasting a moment, Heaven forbid, Harry grabs a plate and stacks it high with treacle tart. They're all crunchy and sticky and his mouth is watering just at the sight of them. They also smell nice, intoxicatingly sweet. His first bite is like when a man wandering the sands for several weeks finally quenches his thirst after days of going without water. It's pure bliss. Sinfully so. He swallows and the treacle flows down his throat smoothly. It's by far the best treacle tart he's ever had. Harry's going to have to ask one of the house elves for the recipe. That is, if he finds one. Dobby mainly. He hopes.</p>\n<p>He ends up devouring everything on his plate. Hermione looks a bit disgusted by him and also a little bit awed. \"Unbelievable,\" she mutters. \"<em>Unbelievable.\" </em>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"Harry! There you are -- <em> see </em> , Blaise? I told you he'd be near the treacle tart. Didn't I Theo? Didn't I?\" Pansy pulls on Theodore's arm and shakes it widely, grinning at Harry from where she pushes between people to get to him. Theodore looks worn out, rolling his eyes all the way towards the ceiling as he mouths <em> 'help me.' </em> Blaise walks leisurely behind them, hands stuck in the pockets of his slacks, \"Alright, alright. We get it Pansy. We do.\"\u00a0</p>\n<p>Harry places his empty plate on the table behind him. \"Hello, Pansy,\" he smiles, small and fond. Pansy throws her arms around him in a tight hug and cries dramatically. \"Oh, Harry. I missed you.\" She sniffs loudly into his shoulder.\u00a0 \"I had to level myself with Blaise. It was <em> terrible </em> Harry. <em> Terrible.</em>\"\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"There, there,\" Harry says soothingly, patting the girl on the head. \"You're with me now, everything is fine.\"</p>\n<p>Hermione wipes away a fake tear. \"How tragic,\" she says. \"If only I was there to share the sentiment with you.\"</p>\n<p>Theodore snorts. \"I would have gladly switched with you.\"\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"Forget that,\" Blaise mumbles, eying Hermione up and down with a calculated look, \"we're missing the Weasley. Where is he? Draco's going to throw a fit soon.''</p>\n<p>\"Good,\" Pansy huffs, pulling away from Harry. She settles a hand on her hip and puffs out her cheeks. Her satin, dark green dress sways as she gets on her tiptoes to see past the gathering of people around them.\"I wanna see him embarrass himself.\"</p>\n<p>\"Who's embarrassing themselves?\" Ron asks, suddenly peeking over Blaise's shoulder. He looks soft with his messy hair and his... glossed lips? He's dressed in wonderful green robes with golden outlines. Harry's going to have a heart attack. Ron is <em> pretty.</em></p>\n<p>\"Holy shit,'' he mutters, awed.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"Merlin's beard. What am I seeing? Harry, what am I seeing?\" Pansy rambles. \"Guys, <em> guys.</em>\u00a0What am I seeing?\"\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"An angel?\" Blaise asks himself, stepping to the side so that they can all see him better. Transfixed, he holds out his hand, \"Would you care to dance?\"\u00a0</p>\n<p>Ron blushes, the red colour creeping all the way up to his ears. He fiddles with his fingers and drops his gaze to the floor, biting into the soft flesh of his bottom lip. \"Um. I don't know how to dance, so\u2026\"\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bewildered, Blaise drops his hand.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"No, Hermione,<em> no</em>. He's not cute. He's <em> not.\" </em> Hermione closes her eyes and pats her cheeks with the palms of her hands. \"Snap out of it!\"\u00a0</p>\n<p>Ignoring the girl's words, Theo reaches out and cups the so-called angel's cheek. \"That's alright,\" he says softly, \"I can teach you.\"\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"Really?\" Ron asks, beaming when he raises his gaze back up. He tilts his head and the movement makes him lean his cheek further into Theo's hand. \"Thank you!\"\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"Yeah, sure.\" Theo breathes out, not really hearing the boy. He's too busy looking at his freckles. There's so many of them. And they're beautiful. They glint whenever he moves. \"Oh,\" Theo blinks, \"It's suddenly easy to understand why Draco likes you so much.\"</p>\n<p>\"He's wonderful, isn't he?\" A young girl walks up to their group with a smile. Harry eyes her over. She has long, chocolate brown hair and sharp, green eyes. She holds out her hand. \"You must be Harry Potter. I'm Astoria Greengrass. I brought Ron along with me, since you know, the rest of you refused to.\"</p>\n<p>Harry shakes the girl's hand. She's at least a year, maybe two, younger than him. \"Must've been a delight for your sister.\"\u00a0</p>\n<p>Astoria's smile widens. \"Oh, it was.\"\u00a0</p>\n<p>The girl then turns her eyes onto Theo. \"You should stop that before Draco gets here. You know him. He'll make a fit and embarrass himself.\" She shakes her head from side to side, as if she's disappointed in the boy.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Theo pulls away from Ron and pockets his hands. \"Yeah, yeah.\" He mumbles. \"Draco's possessive. I know.\"\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"Now,\" Astoria claps her hands and jumps up and down, giddy with excitement. Her green eyes sparkle as she looks at Harry with wide, curious eyes. \"Where are the snakes? Can I meet them? What are their names? Are they cute?\"\u00a0</p>\n<p>Harry blinks, slow and owlish, bombarded by the questions. Astoria is really different compared to her older sister. More childish, but that's to be expected from the letters that she had sent. \"Cute?\" He asks, his brows furrowing. \"More like annoying.\"</p>\n<p>From his neck, Verde and Nimmy hiss at him in mock warning, but Harry ignores them in favour of taking them down from his neck. They curl around his hands tightly, almost possessively as he shows them off to a starry eyed Astoria.\u00a0</p>\n<p><em> Ah</em>. Harry thinks with a small smile. <em> Looks like Draco isn't the only possessive one in their group.\u00a0 </em></p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<b>Chapter Seventeen:\u00a0</b>\n</p>\n<p>Harry realises, a bit too late, that wearing the necklace made from the philosopher's shard is a strong declaration of\u2026 <em> something </em> towards Voldemort. And whatever it is, makes whoever knows about it, lose their <em> fucking </em> minds.</p>\n<p>For instance, Barty Crouch Jr, who is supposed to be locked up in Azkaban but isn't -- <em> and why isn't Harry surprised about that </em>-- spots Harry between the crowd of wizards and witches, lowers his gaze towards the shard necklace and then promptly chokes on the glass of champagne that he's drinking. Barty turns red in the face and then abruptly turns around to face one of the Lestrange brothers -- Rabastan, if he's not mistaken -- and pulls on the other males sleeve. He says something that has Rabastan shaking his head and laughing.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Barty, who looks just about done with the situation, lays his hand onto Rabastan's face and pushes his jaw to the side so that he's facing Harry\u2019s direction. At once, Rabastan's laughter dies out. His dark eyes widen like saucers and his mouth falls agape.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Smiling, Harry raises a hand and waves like the suicidal idiot that he is.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Weirdly enough, Rabastan weakly waves back.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"Harry,\" Hermione starts from somewhere behind him, tone exasperated, \"who are you waving at?\"</p>\n<p>Harry turns to look behind him and blinks, somewhat caught off guard. \"Oh. I'm waving at Rabastan. Lestrange. You don't know him.\"</p>\n<p>Hermione's nose scrunches up. She eyes Rabastan across the ball room with narrowed eyes. When she turns back to Harry, her gaze is suspicious. \"Yes, but <em> how </em> do <em> you </em> know <em> him? </em> Know <em> Them?\" </em>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"Uh,\" Harry fumbles awkwardly. \"It\u2019s a long story 'Mione--\"</p>\n<p>Abruptly, the girl steps right into Harry's personal space. There's a single breath between them and the tips of their noses are touching. Hermione's scowl is deep and annoyed. When she speaks, her words are purposefully slow, as if she's talking to a child. \"Do <em> not,</em>\" she seethes, \"call me <em> that.</em>\"\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"Why?\" Harry tilts his head ever so slightly, the motion makes it seem like he's leaning in for an impromptu kiss. \"Are you afraid of friendship? Dependence on another human being? Is it anxiety? Is that what it is? I can get you some anxiety pills if that's what you need. Probably--\"</p>\n<p>Harry stops his rambling when Hermione gets lifted into the air by oncoming hands. Her anger dims into confusion and Harry just stares because <em> what. </em>From beneath Hermione, Harry can see shiny shoes and dark grey robes.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Rabastan's face comes into view from Hermione's shoulder. There's a cheeky smile placed on lips. \"Is she bothering you, Little Lord?\" He asks. His voice is nice, low and sort of gravely.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Harry\u2019s insides become instant mush.\u00a0</p>\n<p>From behind Rabastan, he can just about see Barty -- his hand is outstretched as if he had been trying to haul Rabastan away and failed. His eyes are very, very, very tired.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Understandable. Considering everything that's going on.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"Uh, no, I mean,\" Harry flushes, \"<em>what</em>. What are you doing? Oh my God. Put her down before she gains her composure and bites you. <em> Or worse.\"\u00a0\u00a0 </em></p>\n<p>Rabastan quirks a brow but does as he's told to. He places a still confused Hermione back down onto the group, gently, and then pats her head.</p>\n<p>At once, Hermione comes back online. Her lips curl into her previous scowl. Angry, she curls her hands into fists and stomps on Rabastan's foot.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"Ow!\" The black haired male yelps, catching the attention of nearby people.</p>\n<p>\"Come to the ball, Hermione,\" the girl mutters snidely underneath her breath, \"it's going to be <em> so </em> fun, Hermione.\" She sends a dark glare towards Harry and then turns to walk away.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Harry yells after her. \"Wait, 'Mione! We still haven't talked about that anxiety--\"</p>\n<p>\"There is no anxiety! Let it go!\" Hermione yells back, disappearing into the crowd before her.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Holding his chin between his forefinger and thumb, Harry asks himself quietly, \"Well, if it's not anxiety, then what is it?\"\u00a0</p>\n<p>From his side, Barty merely drops his head into his hands and groans loudly.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"We're leaving,\" he says, rolling his eyes towards the ceiling, \"before<em> he </em> finds us talking to something that belongs to <em>him.\" </em> Barty then grabs Rabastan by the sleeve, looking almost as sour as Daphne does when there's a mention of Ron and Draco in the same sentence, \"cmon. Or else <em> he'll </em> literally eviscerate us--\"</p>\n<p>Rabatsan pouts.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He fucking <em> pouts</em>.</p>\n<p>Harry's mental image of the so-called scary Death Eaters crumbles.</p>\n<p>\"I don't want to. Let me talk to the Little Lord--</p>\n<p>\"Rabastan. Barty.\" A smooth, sort of throaty voice comes from deep down in the throat. It penetrates their bickering into silence.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Harry freezes from head to toe. He <em> knows </em> that voice. Well, if Rabastan's voice turned his insides into mush than this rich, dark voice makes them into something <em> more </em>.\u00a0</p>\n<p>While Lestrange grins, wide and broad, Barty's lips turn down into a frown. They step apart to let the owner of the voice be seen.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"Sorry, Lestrange is being a <em> child </em> again--\"</p>\n<p>\"Only because <em> you're </em> being the adult--\"</p>\n<p>Trembling from anticipation, Harry stares up at Tom <em> fucking </em> Riddle with wide, green eyes -- an older version of him, anyways, he looks to be around his mid twenties. His lips part but make no sound and from around his neck, Harry can feel Nimmy and Verde rearing their heads.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"<em>Who's that?\" </em>Nimmy asks from the right.\u00a0</p>\n<p>From the left, Verde makes the snake equivalent sound of a human's hum. \"<em>He smells like you, Master. Why?\" </em></p>\n<p>Not being able to make a sound, Harry just <em> stares</em>. It is <em> unfair </em> how handsome this older version of Tom Riddle is. The diary version had been still young, boyish almost but this version is\u2026 just <em> too </em> fucking good looking.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Again. It is <em> highly </em> unfair.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Harry's green eyes make contact with deep, red ones and something inside him shifts ever so slightly. It feels like a gentle touch of warmth. It seeps out from the scar of his forehead and spreads throughout his body, setting goosebumps across his skin.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Unbeknownst to Harry, his hair turns startlingly white. It is like the first sign of snow -- pure, pristine and breathtaking.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Dazed, he moves as if possessed by another being. Harry stumbles into Tom's chest and wraps his arms around the males waist. He inhales the scent of Tom. He is <em> fresh </em> and <em> clean </em> and <em> sharp </em>. Harry muffles a whimper into Tom's robes when the older of the two just stands there and doesn't hold him back, likely frozen by the unexpected hug.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Through the haze in his mind, Harry concludes that Tom doesn't know what affection is and therefore doesn't know how to recuperate a hug.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The sound of Barty choking on nothing but thin air and Rabstan coughing to hide a laugh is as good as an answer he'll ever get.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Suddenly, hesitantly, Tom's fingers touch the edge of Harry's jaw and gently lift his head up. The skin to skin contact sends shivers wracking up and down Harry's spine. He leans his face into Tom's hand and gazes up at him with glazed eyes. <em> \"I miss'd you,\" </em> he slurs, completely gone on the feeling of tentative heat and safety and--</p>\n<p><em> Safety, </em> some part of Harry's brain snorts, <em> you don't even know what that is. </em>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He politely tells that part of his brain to <em> fucking shut up. </em>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tom quirks a single brow and something akin to wild curiosity and fiery hunger flashes in his ruby coloured eyes. The hand he has on Harry's cheek moves to slide around the side of his throat. Tom's long, elegant fingers wrap around his neck tightly. In his low, sultry voice, he asks, <em> \"How could you have missed me if we haven't properly met before?\"\u00a0 </em></p>\n<p><em> \"Watch where you're touching!\" </em> Verde hisses, angrily moving across Harry's shoulders. He settles himself by his sister. <em> \"Who do you think you are? Touching my Master without perm--\" </em></p>\n<p>Nimmy raises her tail and slaps it across Verde's snout. \"<em>Be quiet</em>.\" She hushes. \"<em>The adults are talking now.\"\u00a0 </em></p>\n<p>\n<em> \"The adults my ass--\" </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em> \"You don't even have one--\" </em>\n</p>\n<p>Too wrapped up in each other, the two parselmouths don't even notice the arguing snakes sitting on Harry\u2019s shoulder.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lips puckering into a pout, Harry feels confusion through the cloudiness in his head. <em> \"You don't remember?\" </em> He asks, tone timid and quiet. <em> \"You don't remember that I have a part of your soul in me? That I'm your horcrux?\"\u00a0 </em></p>\n<p>The hand around Harry\u2019s neck tightens and becomes more firm. Tom's red eyes shine with feral possessiveness. <em> \"My horcrux,\" </em> he breathes out, completely enthralled<em>, \"my little horcrux.\"\u00a0 </em></p>\n<p>He moves his hand so that his palm rests against Harry's cheek once more. Tom threads his fingers into thick locks of white hair and tugs on them ever so gently. He watches in utter fascination as Harry tilts his head back with the movement and exposes the tanned length of his neck.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The smile that graces Tom's lips is wide and toothy, predatory. <em> \"My beautiful, little horcrux,\" </em>he murmurs and then tips his head so that his lips graze over his beloved horcrux's forehead.\u00a0</p>\n<p>That blush that then takes over Harry's face is breathtaking.</p>\n<p>//unedited\u00a0<br><br></p>\n<p>\n<b> <em>Chapter Eighteen:\u00a0</em> </b>\n</p>\n<p>\"It must have been an accident,\" Tom murmurs, grazing his thumb ever so softly over Harry's scar. They're locked away from prying eyes, hidden in one of the many study rooms of Malfoy Manor. The colour theme in this room is much softer compared to the rest, it's all rich browns and warm golds. The room is also casted in a dim glow from the fireplace.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Nimmy and Verde are still arguing. Only now they're slithering around each other on the work desk on the other side of the room.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"Mhhm,\" Harry hums from where he's sitting across the dark loveseat, one leg casually thrown over the Dark Lord's thigh. It fits snugly between Tom's own legs. Harry's eyes are half lidded as Tom inspects his scar with curious eyes. The fingers skimming over his mark are like a featherlight touch. He's got goosebumps all over his body and he's so, <em> so </em> warm. He's <em> gooey </em> and <em> floaty </em> and filled to the brim with butterflies.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Which he shouldn't be. Because this is Tom. Tom -- <em> Voldemort </em> -- who had connected his skin to Harry's own years and years ago and had set it promptly on fire. And that fiery, bruising pain had left an unseen mark, but <em> this</em>, <em> this </em> touch right now, isn't anything like before.\u00a0</p>\n<p>And it's mind blowing.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"Still,\" Tom's voice is quiet between them, filled with something akin to awe, \"a human horcrux. How <em> peculiar</em>. How truly <em> curious.</em>\" He holds Harry's face between his hands and stares down at him with an unreadable expression. There's a slight furrow between his brows but that's all Harry can read from his expression.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"How do you know about them? About the horcruxes?\" Tom questions.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Harry gets lost in the feeling of being held in the other males hands. His brain just fills and fills with endorphins. When was the last time he had let someone touch him like this? He can't even remember. For a moment he is quiet and then he remembers that he has to answer. With a breathy voice, he asks, \"about <em> yours </em> or just generally?\"\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tom's hold turns abruptly bruising. His fingers slip into still white hair and they pull harshly onto whatever locks of hair they can.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Harry just lets out a long breath, hardly affected by the slight tinge of pain. He watches rage build inside deep red eyes and gets lost in them. Tom's lips curl into a cruel scowl. <em> \"How do you know about my horcruxes?\" </em>He hisses, voice dangerously low. His chest heaves with effort and his breath quickens.\u00a0</p>\n<p><em> Hot, </em>Harry thinks, <em> he's so hot. </em>\u00a0</p>\n<p>His brain is everywhere but in this conversation. For fucks sake. Just when he needs it--</p>\n<p><em> \"Tell me.\" </em>Tom orders. The flickering flames from the fireplace cast shadows onto his face and make him seem like he's shrouded in the dark. Like he's unreachable. Like he's--</p>\n<p>It's funny how Tom's very own eyes give him away. The same rage that shines within them reflects the fear of death that he holds. How sad. How very, truly sad.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Harry places one hand onto Tom's wrist and the other on top of the large hand that sits on his cheek. He feels a fluttering pulse and closes his eyes. Harry leans right into Tom's palm and settles there with a quiet, content sigh. <em> \"I won't hurt them,\" Harry says, \"they're like me.\" </em> He nuzzles into Tom's hand and feels him turn rigid. <em> \"You trusted me with the stone. So, trust me with this as well.\"\u00a0 </em></p>\n<p>Tom stays quiet and his other hand retreats from Harry's face. Frowning, Harry opens his eyes only to find Tom with a pinched expression.\u00a0</p>\n<p><em> \"Yes,\" </em> he finally relents <em> , \"I trusted an eleven year old who wrote me a letter about the philosopher\u2019s stone which was covered in hearts. Surely I should trust him to keep my horcruxes a secret. There's absolutely no reason to be weary at all.\"\u00a0 </em></p>\n<p>Harry sucks in his bottom lip. <em> \"The hearts looked pretty,\" </em> he defends.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tom's eyes narrow.<em> \"I thought you were mocking me. I wanted to kill you.\"\u00a0 </em></p>\n<p><em> \"I wasn't mocking you!\" </em> Harry hurries to add. He averts his eyes and his cheeks turn red as he speaks, <em> \"I just got a little carried away, is all.\"\u00a0 </em></p>\n<p><em> \"And anyways,\" </em> Harry huffs and glances back at Tom, <em> \"</em><b><em>you're</em> </b> <em> the one who sent </em> <b> <em>me</em> </b> <em> a shard of the philosopher\u2019s stone.\" </em></p>\n<p>Tom bristles. He <em> actually </em> bristles. <em> \"I sent it to you as a gift,\" he states, \"a gift! For helping me get the stone. You're the one who changed it into a necklace--\"\u00a0 </em></p>\n<p>Here, he cuts himself off. Tom blinks. Once. Twice. And then thrice for good measure. He abruptly pulls Harry closer, right into his lap, and settles his arms around his waist.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Harry\u2019s already red cheeks darken further. The flush travels all the way to the tips of his ears and Tom catches himself thinking that Harry looks rather pretty like this -- sitting in his lap, looking flushed and confused. <em> \"W-what are you doing?\" </em>He asks.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Ignoring the question, Tom hooks a finger around the thin thread of Harry's necklace and tugs on it. The shard piece glints invitingly. <em> \"You are playing a very dangerous game, Potter.\" </em></p>\n<p>\n<em> \"I'm literally sitting in your lap. I hugged you and you didn't kill me. You can call me Harry.\" </em>\n</p>\n<p>Tom takes a deep, deep breath and reminds himself that his patience will get him rewarded one day. <em> \"Then, you are playing a very dangerous game, Harry.\" </em></p>\n<p><em> \"Better,\" </em> Harry grins, wide and impish. <em> \"Now, hold on and let me get comfortable.\" </em> He shifts himself on Tom's lap so that his knees are on each side of the male. He grabs the hand that Tom isn't using to hold his necklace and places it onto his lower back. <em> \"There,\" </em> his already wide grin widens, \"d<em>one.\"\u00a0 </em></p>\n<p>Harry earns a pinch to his side and a frustrated sigh.</p>\n<p><em> \"You brat,\" </em> Tom seethes, <em> \"do you not know that your actions have consequences? Here you are walking around collared, particularly announcing to the world that you belong to me.\"\u00a0 </em></p>\n<p>Harry tilts his head ever so slightly and fiddles with Tom's robes. They're nice and soft and are coloured sort of pale grey with silver outlines. <em> \"Don't I?\" </em>He asks quietly.</p>\n<p>Tom's expression turns bewildered. <em> \"I killed your parents,\" </em> he deadpans. He doesn't look the least bit remorseful. <em>\"You should be screaming at me. Threatening me. Firing spells at me. Not sitting in my lap acting coy.\"\u00a0 </em></p>\n<p><em> \"Hey!\" </em> Harry slaps at Tom's chest half-heartedly. <em> \"I'm not acting coy. I am coy.\"\u00a0 </em></p>\n<p>Tom's bewilderment only furthers.\u00a0</p>\n<p><em> \"And besides,\" </em> Harry sniffs, <em> \"it's not like I remember them or whatever. So, I forgive you.\" </em> He stubbornly crosses his arms over his chest and narrows his green eyes into a glare. <em> \"Either you accept my forgiveness or I'm getting off your lap.\" </em></p>\n<p>Tom's hand moves suspiciously quick from his back to fully wrap around his waist. Harry is then easily tugged forwards, closer to the Dark Lord than he had been before. <em> \"I wasn't asking for your forgiveness,\" </em> Tom scowls, having to lower his head so that he can make eye contact with Harry, <em> \"but I suppose I'll accept it.\" </em></p>\n<p><em> \"Then,\" </em> Harry licks his lips, <em> \"I am yours. Because that's what you said earlier. You called me your, um,\" </em> he fumbles over his words, <em> \"y-your, um\u2026\" </em>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tom rests the necklace back against the hollow of Harry's throat and effectively stops his stuttering. <em> \"Do you know the meaning of this necklace?\" </em>He asks. His voice is soft now, low, sort of honeyed. There's a tiny lift to the corner of his mouth.</p>\n<p>Dazed, Harry shakes his head no.\u00a0</p>\n<p><em>\"This necklace that you made from my gift to you,\" </em>Tom pauses to lean his head back into the loveseat and his eyes glint in possessiveness just like before<em>, \"is a warning for anyone elsel interested to stay away. It means that you are mine, Harry, and mine alone. Do you understand?\"</em></p>\n<p><em>\"Yes.\" </em>Harry breathes out, feeling his insides melt into nothingness. He makes a soft, high pitched, needy whine and leans in to rub his cheek against Tom's own. <em>\"Yours. Just yours.\"</em></p>\n<p>Tom's hand comes to rest at the back of his head. It's large and warm and Harry feels safe, content in Tom's embrace. Tom pets his hair like one would pet a dogs fur and Harry loses himself in the feeling of finally being affectionate with someone.\u00a0</p>\n<p><em> \"You\u2019re needy.\" </em> Tom murmurs and then, after a short moment, he ads, <em> \"I'll keep you, my little horcrux.\" </em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em> //unedited. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>Chapter Nineteen:\u00a0</b>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The days after the Malfoy's annual ball are\u2026 missing.

But since Harry is Harry and therefore immune to bullshit because he invented bullshit, he's most definitely not worrying.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>What he does remember is falling asleep on Tom's lap and then waking up on the loveseat, alone and covered with a grey cloak -- Tom's, it looked like -- and it was still warm. He remembers returning back to the ballroom, having found it void of Tom and pouting for the rest of the night. He might have danced with Pansy, but he isn't quite sure. What he does know is that he ate another slice of treacle tart and what happened after that, well, that's a mystery to Harry.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>He supposes he could ask Draco, or Ron, or Hermione or anyone else for that matter. But he would rather not know, what if he had done something embarrassing? He'd have to off himself again just to get rid of his embarrassment.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<span>Ah</span>\n</em>\n<span>, he thinks, </span>\n<em>\n<span>decisions, decisions.\u00a0</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\"Hey,\" Harry turns to talk to Draco who, as usual, is sitting beside him at breakfast, \"what day is it today?\"\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Draco pauses mid bite on his buttered toast. For a moment he is as still as a statue and then he closes his mouth. Weirdly enough his eyes are starting to water and his hands are trembling as he places his toast back down onto his plate.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\"What?\" Harry asks, furrowing his brows in confusion. \"Is there something on my face again?\"\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\"You're back,\" Draco says, voice filled with relief, \"you were gone for so long and i--\"\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\"Harry, ignore him.\" Pansy voices from down the table, looking done with the situation at hand. \"He's just being a drama queen again. You know how he is, all the spotlight needs to be on him.\"</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Draco glares at her. He opens his mouth to retort something back but Theo cuts him off.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\"Yeah,\" Theo nods from beside Pansy, \"nothing bad happened. You just disappeared into your head for about four days.\" He pauses. \"I think.\"</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\"And you didn't talk, barely ate and barely slept. Nothing to be worried about at all.\" Blaise adds, opening the daily prophet with a scowl. \"Oh good,\" he mutters to himself, \"my mother's boyfriend is on page six. Dead. Yet again.\"\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\"It was terrible!\" Draco exclaims, completely ignoring Blaise. \"I was </span>\n<em>\n<span>so</span>\n</em>\n<span> alone.\"\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Tracey sighs. \"That's it,\" she stands to her feet and gathers her books into her arms. \"I'm leaving before you all start arguing over useless necessities.\"\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\"Harry,\" she calls, turning towards him, \"have some treacle tart. It will make you feel better.\" She then leaves the table with a mutter off, \"I should have gone to Ravenclaw.\"</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\"Great,\" Pansy scrunches up her nose, not looking the least bit remorseful, \"look what you did blondie, you made her leave.\"</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\"And are you sure it wasn't your disgusting personality that did it?\" Draco snides, his lips curling into a scathing smirk.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Harry rolls his eyes and reaches for a large slice of treacle tart. While the baby death eaters argue around him over this and that, he can't help but think that he's missed this. He's been offline for what? Four? Five days? And his friends are still idiots? It's nice.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Also, the treacle is as amazing as ever. Tracy was right. He is already feeling better. Harry hums happily around his spoonful, blissfully unaware of the consequences his actions have made a few days prior.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\"What does my hair have to do with this!?\"</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\"Everything! There's too much gel!\"\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Though, he supposes it could be a little quieter. Oh well, you lose some, you win some.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Three treacle tarts eaten and six different arguments later, the Slytherins leave the great hall and set off towards their first class. On their way there, Draco bad mouths Pansy behind her back to Blaise, whose head is still stuck in the pages of the daily prophet.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\"Unbelievable!\" Pansy stops in her tracks and abruptly turns around to point an accusing finger at Draco. \"You!\" She growls. \"How dare you talk about me behind my back?\"</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\"Me?\" Draco feigns surprise, holding his hand over his heart. His eyes are wide and his expression is ever so innocent. \"I would never.\" His act is impeccable, if not for the earlier argument, Harry is sure he would have fallen for it.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\"It's true!'' Pansy waves around her hand, her silver bracelet is flashing. It's the one Harry had gifted to her for Christmas and it seemed like it was working well enough.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Theo sighs, long and suffering. \"We'll be late for class,\" he murmurs. He doesn\u2019t look the least bit worried about being late, Harry comes to the conclusion that he just wants to escape before the real fight starts.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Before Pansy can even pull out her wand to inevitably hex Draco, Harry steps in with narrowed eyes. \"Enough,\" he says, tone surprisingly cold. \"Behave, we're going to class.\"</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Pansy and Draco follow after Harry with identical pouts, still murmuring insults to each other but sulking whilst doing so.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Behind them, Blaise folds his daily prophet in half and shoves it into his bag. He then passes over a gallon to Theo, avoiding eye contact while doing so.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\"See?\" Theo throws his arm around Blaise's shoulders. His arm is heavy and warm. \"I was right. The new boyfriend wouldn't even last two weeks.\"\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Blaise shrugs the offending arm off and stalks after Harry. His shoulders are cold now. \"I hate you.\"\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\"Aw,\" Theo is quick to follow, his grin wide and toothy, \"don't be like that.\"\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>At the front of the group, Harry internally berates himself. He was too cold. Too standoffish. Too much like his old self. And the two had listened? Actually listened? To him of all people? Well, they were still insulting each other but they were a lot quieter now, which was a miracle in itself.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>When they finally arrive at Charms, they are very late.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>There is no surprise there.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>During the lesson, Harry partners up with Hermione, content on letting her lead in whatever theory she has about the charm she wants to use.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Harry barely understands her big words but she looks happy and really, that's what matters most. It is rather unfortunate that when Seamus Finnigan tries an easy fire charm, it quite literally explodes and burns his eyebrows right off.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>It is also rather unfortunate that he\u2019s fallen under the wrath of Hermione who immediately berates him on his technique.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\"Poor Seamus,\" Ron says, holding his hands out in prayer. \"I hope he lives, Hermione can be quite scary.\"</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Harry laughs good-naturedly, remembering how the girl had punched Draco, endured so much and still saved him time and time again from danger, only to scold him afterwards. \"She sure can be.\"\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n<b>Chapter Twenty: </b>\n</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Seamus Finnigan does in fact live.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">But only because Harry drags Hermione away before she can start throwing hands.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The rest of their day is spent in double Transfiguration and after that their little group splits apart. Draco leads Ron towards the dungeons, hopefully to confess. Harry has suffered enough of their feelings already. Pansy, Blaise and Theo head for the great hall while Tracy stays behind to ask a few questions. Meanwhile, Harry trails behind Hermione who, as usual, takes them to the library.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Hermione heads for the shelves and Harry takes a seat at their usual table, hidden from prying eyes. He stretches out his arms above his head and yawns. <em>A nap would be great right around now</em>, he internally mulls.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Unfortunately, his nap plans are ruined the moment Hermione settles down four thick tomes onto the table. She takes her seat opposite him, leans her chin into the palm of her hand and stares at him with curious eyes.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\"So,\" she starts, voice low and calm. For a moment she is quiet and Harry worries for the worst. Does she know he's not supposed to be here? Not supposed to be in this world? Dammit. He knows she's clever <em>but what the actual fuck. </em></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\"I saw you leave the ball with a man,\" Hermione drops her words like a bomb and Harry blinks. Once. Twice. Thrice.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\"Huh?\"</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\"Oh, don't act stupid Harry.\" Hermione leans forward and her dark eyes significantly narrow. \"Tall. Wavy hair. Good looking.\"</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\"Um, right,\" Harry struggles to talk, \"you see...\"</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\"Well?\" Hermione pries. \"You can't tell Pansy because she wouldn't be able to keep it to herself and Draco would immediately tell it to his father. Blaise and Theo would hold it over your head and Tracy wouldn't be interested. I'm your last option, so tell me.\"</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\"There's still Ron,\" Harry points out weakly.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\"He's too innocent,\" Hermione shoots him down instantly. She is nothing if not thorough if she wants something.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The green eyed male sighs. \"Are you sure?\" He asks.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Hermione nods, not looking the least bit embarrassed for prying. \"Absolutely.\"</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\"Ok...\"</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Harry raises his hand and drags it through the air. A simple silencing ward washes over them. Hermione's eyes visibly darken. Harry settles his hand back down to his lap. \"I'll teach you,\" he says, \"but first... that wasn't just any man. That was Voldermort.\"</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Silence looms over them. Harry purses his lips and fiddles with his fingers for a solid minute before Hermione reaches for something in her bag. It's the daily prophet. She rolls the paper into a tube and then swiftly hits it over Harry's head.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\"<em>Ow</em>!\"</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\"You idiot!\" Hermione scolds. \"You went into a private room with a killer!?\"</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\"He's not so bad,\" Harry defends, rubbing the top of his head. <em>Talk about deja vu.</em></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\"Not Bad?\" Hermione uses the paper to hit him again, this time the side of his shoulder since he evades the hit in the last second.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\"Again,\" Harry scowls, \"ow!\"</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\"He tried to kill you, Harry. I'm sorry if me worrying hurts you.\"</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\"This is you worrying?\" Harry mutters, rubbing his shoulder. \"It doesn't feel like it. You know, worrying over me isn't supposed to be you hitting me with the daily prophet. You should be hugging me right now, thanking Merlin or whatever that I survived.\"</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Again, the bushy haired girl hits him over the head. She takes a deep breath, her hold on the daily prophet visibly tightening. \"How did you survive?\"</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\"Funny story,\" Harry gives a wide grin, his green eyes turning into crescent moons. \"I hugged him. Ha ha.\"</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Again. Silence.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Harry doesn't open his eyes until another minute has passed. He finds Hermione, statue still, staring past his shoulder with a pained expression. If Harry didn't know any better, he would misinterpret it as constipation, but alas.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">''Harry,\" Hermione's voice is soft now, quiet, like all the energy has been drained from her. \"What else did you do?\"</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\"Uh,\" Harry's cheeks redden, \"nothing. Really. We just talked. He didn't ask for forgiveness but I forgave him anyway so now we're... uh... how should I put it? Frenemies? Yeah. Let's go with that.\"</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Something in Hermione's expression cracks. She drops her head into her hands and sobs. Rather loudly at that.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\"I'm not going to learn anything from you because you'll be dead!\" She wails. She raises her head and her eyes are slightly red, tears gathering at the corners of her eyes. She moves the tomes to the side and reaches out to hold his hands. \"Harry,\" she sniffles, \"the only way you'll survive now is if you <em>marry him.</em> Harry, marry him. <em>Please</em>.\"</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Harry's amusement spills from his mouth in the form of laughter, soft and rich and very, very real. His chest moves with the sound and he looks... different.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Hermione stares at him in awe.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\"Sorry, sorry,\" Harry slips into giggles and then slowly comes to a stop. His mouth is curved into a beautiful smile. He holds Hermione's hands with a firm yet gentle grip. In a reassuring voice, he says, \"Relax 'Mione. He won't hurt me.\"</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">For a moment, Hermione thinks that with a smile like that even the worst of criminals would drop to their knees. So why not Voldemort himself?</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><em>Oh</em>, she thinks, <em>oh</em>.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Hermione's tone is curious when she speaks. \"The necklace is from him,\" she says. \"And you can both speak to snakes... I think, Harry, I think Vol--,\" she cuts herself off, \"I think he's courting you.\"</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Like a confused puppy, Harry tilts his head. \"Courting me? Do you even hear yourself? Why would he court me? I'm just Harry.''</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\"Just Harry,\" Hermione repeats, bewildered. She watches as Harry's expression morphs into hesitance. His lips move and form words but Hermione can't hear them.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">She leans even further across the table and frowns. \"Speak up,\" she says, \"I can't hear you.\"</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Begrudgingly, Harry repeats his earlier words. \"I said that I was his a-and,\" Harry avoids Hermione's gaze, his cheeks reddening, \"he said that he would keep me.\" The last part is whispered.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\"Yes!\" Hermione exclaims, jumping up from her seat. She throws her arms into the air in victory. \"You're going to get married so you can teach me and obviously so you don't die. It's a win-win situation.\"</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Harry, who is now staring at Hermione like she's dumb, can't help but let his head fall into his hands. Why couldn't he have just told Ron? He would have been more understanding, and would have told him it was too dangerous.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">It was clear all Hermione cared for was knowledge and with that marriage idea now stuck in her head, she wouldn't just get it from him, oh no, she'd get the knowledge from Tom too.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\"But before that,\" Hermione calms down and levels Harry with a serious look, \"I need to ask. Are you alright with this? The courting? We could always ask Ms. Zabini,\" she mimics a knife slashing her throat, \"to take care of him.\"</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\"It's... fine. I guess. I don't know.\" Harry replies. \"I've already forgiven him and everything is in the past. So, it should be okay, but I don't really know anything about,\" Harry pretends to gag, \"<em>feelings</em>. Maybe we're just friends now? Also, I'm not sure if Blaise will appreciate it if we ask his Mother for murdery things.\"</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\"Well,\" Hermione sits back down, \"you've got six years to figure out your feelings for one of the worst people on this planet--\"</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\"Six years?\"</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\"Until you're legal.\"</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\"<em>Right</em>.\" <em>I forgot about that part. </em></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n<b>Chapter Twenty One:</b>\n</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">One Saturday afternoon, Harry is left alone in his dorm room; well, as alone as he can be with his two snakes.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\"<em>Master, I beg of you, please do not open that box,\" </em>Verde hisses, slithering around in anxiety filled circles across Harry's bed. \"<em>It's dangerous.\"\u00a0</em></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Nimmy, who is sitting around Harry\u2019s shoulders, gives the snake equivalent of a human's sigh and if she could, she'd roll her eyes too. \"<em>Danger is obviously going to draw our Master in, you idiot.\"\u00a0</em></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\"<em>She\u2019s right,\"</em> Harry nods, <em>\"now I definitely have to open it.\"\u00a0</em></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Verde, like usual when he is denied something, throws himself backwards onto the bed, his belly on full display. He wriggles around in an obvious show of displeasure; he's throwing another temper tantrum. It's his third one today. \"<em>It's from that wretched thing,\"</em> he sulks, \"<em>He's gotten his fangs into our master. Just wait until I see him next time, I'll wrap my hands around his throat and--\"\u00a0</em></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><em>\"Again,\"</em> Nimmy cuts him off, <em>\"you have no hands.\"</em></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><em>\"Not in this form,\"</em> Verde mutters snidely, turning back onto his stomach. He swiftly moves out of the way before his sister can jump from Harry\u2019s shoulders and hit him with her tail.\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Nimmy hisses at him in warning but doesn't follow after him.\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Odd. Considering Verde knows how much Nimmy likes to bully him. Pausing, he asks, \"<em>What's wrong?\"</em>\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><em>\"It's nothing,\"</em> she replies, flicking out her tongue to taste the air. She tilts her little head and hides it in the dip of Harry\u2019s throat.\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Not convinced, Verde hesitantly slithers back over to Harry.<em> \"Are you sure?\"</em>\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">When Nimmy doesn't answer, Verde lowers his head onto his master's knee and reminds himself to ask her later.\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Harry, who is too busy staring at the neatly wrapped gift on the foot of his bed, does not hear their conversation. He sits at the edge of his bed and carefully picks up the small black box. There's a card tucked underneath the shimmery green bow and Harry slowly pulls it out to read it.\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n<em>[ Dear Harry,\u00a0</em>\n</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n<em>I hope we meet again soon.\u00a0</em>\n</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n<em>LV. ]</em>\n</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\"Oh,\" Harry blushes all the way from the tips of his ears down to his neck. His stomach immediately fills up with butterflies and his hair shifts into different colours. Soft, delicate pink spreads from the top of his head and then blends into pristine white at the ends.\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\"<em>Well</em>,\" Nimmy raises her head and travels to the top of Harry\u2019s head to curl into his hair, <em>\"I still like the blue better but I suppose this isn't bad either.\"\u00a0</em></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><em>\"Very pretty,\"</em> Verde agrees. There's not a hint of a lie in his words.\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><em>\"What is?\"</em> Harry asks, raising a single brow. There's a hint of confusion settled across his features.\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><em>\"Nothing,\"</em> the siblings chorus innocently.\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Harry eyes the two with suspicion but doesn't question further. Instead, he returns his attention back to the gift he's received from Tom. He settles the card to the side and then unwraps the satin green bow. Inside the box lies an intricate silver key. When Harry picks it up it lays warm and heavy in his palm.\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><em>\"It smells weird,\"</em> Verde complains. He hauls himself across Harry's thigh and wraps himself around his free wrist. Verde then tucks his snout underneath the sleeve of his master's black sweater.\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><em>\"Master, throw it away,\"</em>\u00a0Nimmy insists. She curls into herself and buries her snout into Harry's white and pink hair.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\"<em>Yes,\"</em> Verde hurriedly adds, his voice muffled<em>, \"throw it away.\"</em>\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\"It's a portkey,\" Harry murmurs, completely ignoring the two as he tilts his head to the side. His eyebrows furrow as he turns the key over. There's something etched into the side in golden lettering.\u00a0<br>\u00a0<br>\"<em><b>Domum</b></em>,\" he reads.\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Suddenly, a feeling Harry knows all too well, a hook grabs him from somewhere behind the navel and pulls him forcefully forward. It is, as always, highly uncomfortable.\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The hook then promptly drops him and Harry stumbles forward onto white marble floors. \"Had to be a portkey,\" he frowns, stomach churning, \"couldn\u2019t have been a nice bracelet or a pretty ring?\"\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><em>\"I knew it,\"</em> Verde grouches. \"<em>You should have crushed it and thrown it away, Master.\"\u00a0</em></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><em>\"Be quiet,\"</em> Nimmy hisses, slithering back down to Harry's neck where she's safer, \"<em>and don\u2019t you dare throw another temper tantrum. I've had enough of you're presence today. Be gone.\"</em></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\"<em>Did you just--\"</em></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Somewhere behind them, Tom's voice sounds amused, \"If you had wanted something as trivial as jewelry, Harry, you could have asked.\"\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Whipping around, Harry's frown instantly morphs into a bashful grin. \"<em>Tom,\"</em> he greets, voice light and airy. He sounds breathless. Being in the presence of Tom does that to him. Just like it has his heart thumping loudly behind his ribcage and his cheeks reddening.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Curse Tom's good looks.\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">And curse Bellatrix Lestrange for suddenly cupping his face with her warm hands. \"Oh look at you,\" she says, \"you've got some Sirius in you, that's for sure. And that hair, it's just like my sister's. C'mon. Let's get you something to eat.\" She clasps his hand instead and then drags him along.\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Unlike the Bellatrix that Harry remembers, this one is calm. Gentle, mostly. She still has her wild curly hair and her sharp smile, but she is <em>different</em>. Very different. The contrast between the old Bellatrix and the new Bellatrix is so vast it's nearly funny.\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Harry throws a look over his shoulder just before Bellatrix pulls him around the corner and Tom merely waves back at him, mouthing 'have fun.'\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">After walking down several corridors and past rooms furnished with pretty styled decor, they end up in the dining room. It's a large room with cream coloured walls and vast windows. It's even bigger than the Malfoy's, which is really saying something.\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Harry marvels at the long, marble topped table and the matching chairs. It's all so pretty, so shiny. And the food looks heavenly too, there's mashed potatoes with fried vegetables and chicken covered in gravy. Harry spots vanilla pudding and a different variety of beverages. But what really catches his attention, of course, is the very last piece of treacle tart.\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Which Rabastan and Barty seem to be fighting over. Beside them, Rodolphus Lestrange is quietly sipping his coffee.\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\"It's <em>mine</em>,\" Says Barty, nose twisting, \"you've already had <em>three</em> pieces. You're a pig.\"\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\"I've only had three because you've had <em>four</em>,\" Rabastan whines. \"It's not fair and <em>you're</em> the pig here, <em>piggy</em>.\"\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\"Children,\" Bellatrix calls, not the least bit amused. In fact, she sounds sort of tired like she's done with their childish squabbling. \"What did I say about arguing?\"\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\"That we shouldn't do it in front of you,\" Rabastan mutters, pouting. Barty merely closes his eyes for a few seconds and then opens them, looking entirely done.\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Harry tugs on Bellatrix's hand and looks up at her with wide green eyes. \"Can I have the last piece, please?\" He asks. \"I haven't had any treacle tart today.\"</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Which was a lie, but alas. If Harry wanted treacle tart, then he would have it. Life be damned.\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\"Of course you can, sweetie,\" Bellatrix nods. She leads him towards the table and motions for him to take a seat. Harry grins when she places the last piece of treacle tart in front of him. Bellatrix then takes a seat beside him and pats his head. \"Eat up,\" she smiles.\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">And Harry does. This treacle tart is good. Really good. It's rich with flavour and it falls apart nicely into a cream in his mouth. Harry could cry. It's one of the best treacle tarts he's ever had.\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\"Ish'so'good,'' Harry muffles around a mouthful. Bellatrix brightens. \"I'm glad,'' she says, her smile turning softer.\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\"Darling,\" Rodolphus calls softly and Bellatrix falters ever so slightly. \"Let me dream,\" she murmurs, \"if only for a moment.\"\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><em>I wonder</em>, Harry internally mulls, <em>why is she so sad?\u00a0</em></p>\n<p>\n<b>Chapter Twenty-Two:\u00a0</b>\n</p>\n<p>Bellatrix makes Harry try all the foods that they have. Growing up abused and starved, he's not exactly picky. He does describe the tastes though, but only because it seems to make her happy.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Turns out tomato soup is <em> disgusting </em> and jam rolls are delicious. The Eton mess is\u2026 a mess, but nonetheless still pretty good. It's meringue and sweet cream topped with fruit so it suits Harry\u2019s taste buds pretty well. Scotch eggs are scotch eggs, there's nothing new about them and the roast beef with mash is as good as ever. The chicken topped with thick gravy is his favourite though.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He even tries things he's never had before like cauliflower cheese and ok, it <em> doesn't </em> taste that bad. It just leaves a weird taste in his mouth. The onion soup on the other hand is a big, big no from him. The last thing he tries are steamed buns filled with beef and vegetables. They're good. Really good. Harry rates them eleven out of ten. However, treacle tart will always be number one for him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>After the taste testing, Bellatrix shows him around the Manor. The parlour room is pretty, there's no other word for it. The kitchens are huge and Harry itches to bake something in the shiny ovens. There are loads of other rooms like the bed chambers and the handful of lavatories. Bellatrix even takes him down to the cellars where they find Professor Snape mixing potions.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Snape doesn't look the bit surprised to see him. \"Potter,\" he sighs, looking absolutely pained by his existence, \"I'm making the draught of peace. Tell me, how many times should I stir in each direction after the potion has turned white?\"\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"Seven,\" Harry answers in lieu of greeting, blinking owlishly.</p>\n<p>\"Yes,<em>I know</em>.\" Snape sighs, irritated. \"But what if <em> you </em> were the one to brew this potion? What would <em> you </em> do? How many times would <em> you </em> stir?\"\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"Oh,\" Harry says, hiding a wide smile behind his hand. \"I'd stir ten times in each direction. I don't know about you, Professor, but I think ten is a very pretty number-\"</p>\n<p>\"Take him away,\" Snaps begs, looking pleadingly at Bellatrix. \"And don't ever bring him back down here again.\"\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bellatrix laughs, though it's more of a cackle. \"Oh, don't be like that Sev.\" She smiles. \"He's just a child who's got a knack for potions. I do wonder who he reminds me of, though?\"\u00a0</p>\n<p>Snape scowls and gestures with his index finger towards the door. Harry and Bellatrix leave back up the stairs, giggling.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He gets shown the dueling room next. It's a large room with wooden dummies to practise on. There are even weapons hung upon the wall. Harry eyes the medieval swords and axes. They're very shiny and very sharp. He even thinks he sees blood splattered on the floor, but Harry\u2019s <em> obviously </em> blind so it doesn't really concern him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The library is old, vast and <em> warm </em>. There are tall bookshelves reaching from the ceiling to the floor, filled with ancient volumes. Harry runs his fingers across leather bound books and can't help but to grin. He knows Hermione would kill to be here. \"I love libraries,\" he confesses. \"They always make me feel safe.\"\u00a0</p>\n<p>For a single moment, Bellatrix looks at him oddly and then her expression changes in a flash. It's so quick it gives Harry whiplash. The witch ruffles his already messy hair and smiles down at him kindly. \"Would you like to pick out a book?\"\u00a0</p>\n<p>Harry nods a little too eagerly. He searches the library up and down and then abruptly stops between two bookshelves in the far back. Something strange hums in the air, like electricity but not quite. It's almost as if something or <em> someone </em> is calling out to him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Dazed, Harry lets himself be led between the two bookshelves. He stops on the second to last shelf at the bottom and reaches down to pick up a thin, fragile book. It's a small thing. Very old by the looks of it. Carefully, Harry runs his fingers down the pale blue cover. \"The tales of Beedle the Bard,\" he says to himself quietly.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Something like recognition sparks inside his mind. Harry mulls and mulls over the title but can't come up with anything. He thinks he should remember it but he <em> can't</em>.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Hermione's voice suddenly echoes in the back of his mind. Eerie and soft, almost like a whisper <em> '...and as equals, they departed this life.' </em>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Harry blinks, slow and purposeful. <em> 'Gladly</em>,' he thinks. Something warm and sticky trickles down his face. Harry raises his hand to gently touch his nose\u00a0 When he pulls it back to see, there is blood. Unbeknownst to him, his hair colour changes into a deep purple, so dark that it almost looks black.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"Weird,\" he mutters. He tucks his book underneath his arm and makes his way back to Bellatrix with a toothy grin.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"I'm back,\" he says, turning around the corner. His grin widens when he not only finds Bellatrix but Narcissa Malfoy as well.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"Definitely a Black,\" Narcissa's tone is even, not a hint of emotion to be found. She eyes Harry up and down with cold grey eyes. The boy's face is covered with fresh blood, red streaked across his lips like lipstick. His green eyes are alight and his hair is wild around his face like an unkempt halo.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"It's nice to see you, too,\" Harry sighs dramatically. \"Did you bring Draco along?\"\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"No.\"\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"Aw. That's too bad.\"</p>\n<p>Neither Narcissa or Bellatrix comment on Harry\u2019s blood covered face. Instead, the two lead him out of the library and back down several long corridors. Harry sparks a conversation about treacle tart. Bellatrix isn't much of a fan but apparently Narcissa is. They talk about how good the texture is and how much crust there has to be for it to be perfect -- Well, Harry talks. Narcissa just listens and nods here and there.</p>\n<p>\"It's the best desert in the world, nothing else can compare. It's--\" Harry pauses mid word, stopping in his tracks also. He gazes between the open crack of a periwinkle blue, double door. It seems to be another parlour room.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Harry\u2019s heart aches painfully in his chest. He sees long, messy black hair and sharp grey eyes and just <em> freezes.</em>\u00a0He doesn't know <em> what </em> to <em> do </em> . He doesn't know <em> what </em> to <em> think.</em><em>\u00a0\u00a0</em></p>\n<p>Grey eyes meet green and Harry forgets how to <em>breathe</em>. It's like his lungs are on fire. It's like he's been doused in freezing water. It's like he's been buried alive six feet underground. '<em>Monster'</em>, a voice whispers in the back of his mind, '<em>you killed him. Monster--'</em></p>\n<p>\"Harry,\" Bellatrix calls worried, ''what's the matter?\" She asks, placing a hand onto his shoulder. She is a warm and steady presence -- a sudden calm in his disastrous world.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Harry remembers to breathe.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He looks at Bellatrix with wide, watery eyes. He tries to speak but his throat <em> hurts </em> , it <em> hurts </em> and <em> hurts </em> . It <em> hurts </em> like a thousand thorns. It <em> hurts </em> like something heavy lodged in the back of his throat. <em> 'Monsters do not get to cry,' </em> the voice taunts. <em> 'Monsters do not deserve to cry.'\u00a0 </em></p>\n<p><em> \"It's Sirius,\" </em>Harry manages to force out, voice hoarse and body numb. He can taste blood in the back of his throat.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>Chapter Twenty-Three:\u00a0</b>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Harry doesn't remember a lot of things.</p>\n<p>He doesn't remember why he hates the smell of lavender or why he doesn't like tomatoes anymore. Harry doesn\u2019t even remember why everything <em> sweet </em> calls out to him -- mainly treacle tart, but also others like the Eton mess, caramelised sweets or apples dipped in tantalising honey. Greasy foods like chips covered in gravy or overly fried chicken are the same.\u00a0</p>\n<p>There are times where he feels like he might know. It's the feeling of deja vu, like a thin line snapping back and forth trying to stay in the middle but failing miserably. It holds Harry back from remembering.\u00a0</p>\n<p>What he does remember though, is the specific scent of Sirius -- leathery, metallic and full of smoke -- he smells like home, like expensive cologne, like grimmauld place and the burrow mixed into one, wild and free and utterly chaotic; doused in an ounce of black magic.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Harry buries his face deeper into Sirius's chest and breathes in deeply and <em>oh</em> <em>hold on</em>, when did he move into the room and wrap his arms so tightly around the older male? He doesn't get to think when large hands settle onto his cheeks and slowly lift his head up.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Sirius stares down at him with curious grey eyes and dark furrowed brows. He looks somewhat the same as the last time Harry had seen him -- haunted and tired from the side effects of Azkaban but slightly\u2026<em> better </em>. His hair is longer and healthier and his skin isn't as pale anymore.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The grey eyed male tilts his head in confusion, blinking owlishly when he finds dark purple hair and blood running down Harry's nose. Sirius opens his mouth to say something but all that comes out is a rush of minty breath. He's completely baffled.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Harry rolls his green eyes so far back he feels like he might need an exorcism just to get them back down. \"Don't tell me,\" he says, absolutely defeated, \"it's the hair, isn't it?\"\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"Harry,\" Sirius looks oddly serious for a moment, <em> \"no.\"\u00a0 </em></p>\n<p>With a sudden sharp grin, Sirius leads Harry by the small of his back, excusing them both from Bellatrix and Narcissa who don't even look the least bit confused about their hugging session.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Apparently, all Black's have dimensionally time travelled and met their godfather who was supposed to be dead but in reality isn't.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em> (It's the only way Harry can make sense of the Black sisters' reactions.) </em>\n</p>\n<p>\"The Black blood is strong in this one,\" Narcissa simply says, nodding. She's completely monotone and she shows them a thumbs up.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em> (And where did she learn that? Harry is so confused.)\u00a0 </em>\n</p>\n<p>Bellatrix looks close to crying. In fact, she turns around to sob into her sister's shoulder. \"Family reunions make me emotional,\" she wails dramatically, letting her wild and curly hair cover her face like a curtain.\u00a0</p>\n<p>A little later, once Sirius has settled them both into a private room and warded it a little too heavily, Harry learns that it is apparently not his hair, but rather his presence as a whole that fucks shit up. He's a giant <em> 'fuck you, univers </em>e' sign, flashing bright neon colours at everyone and everything.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"Tell me something I don't know,\" Harry muffles into Sirius's chest. He's completely sprawled across the other male, leeching off any and all heat that he can. Sirius is lean with hard muscles and he's radiating heat like a furnace. Harry is <em> so </em> , <em> so </em> comfortable. He could die like this, wrapped up in the smell of smoke and leather and--</p>\n<p>Sirius tangles his long fingers into Harry's hair and effectively turns him into a pile of goo. Harry makes a quiet, weak noise as Sirius pets his hair.\u00a0</p>\n<p><em> This </em> is what happens when you blood adopt someone. It's highly dangerous and turns both party's obsessive. Hundreds of Wizards and Witches have died this way. It's why the ministry had banned it in the first place and made it an act of dark magic.\u00a0</p>\n<p>It is also the reason Harry had known it was <em> his </em> Sirius in the first place and vice versa. They have a deep connection and it is beautiful, remarkable, truly breathtaking, but it is also poison, a dark unknown and greed like no other.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Killing for each other is one thing <em> but\u2026 </em> killing each other is another.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Harry doesn't dwell on his thoughts. He just\u2026 let's himself enjoy the moment; closes his eyes and hides in the crook of Sirius's neck. The smell of something metallic is stronger there and Harry falls asleep breathing it in.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He dreams of building a bridge over a small river. Dreams of long black hair and skeleton-like hands. Dreams of a heavy weight settling across his shoulders and a voice whispering right beside his ear. <em> \u00a0'You are mine, ma\u2026 and I am\u2026' </em></p>\n<p>Harry does not wake up with a start. He wakes up with the slow flutter of his lashes and then with a quiet yawn. He blinks a few times and only then registers that he's in the private room alone. With a pout, Harry makes his way out of the room and walks up and down several corridors, peering into several other rooms.</p>\n<p>He finds a few men playing chess who point him up the corridor and down the stairs. Harry believes he's met them in his past life. He's just always been bad at remembering names and connecting them to faces.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"Thanks,\" says Harry, closing the door behind him. He barely catches the men's chorus of, \"of course, Little Lord,\" and nearly trips.</p>\n<p><em> 'Great, </em> ' Harry snarks internally, ' <em> everyone seems to know me but I don't know anyone. Typical.' </em></p>\n<p>At the bottom of the stairs, Harry bumps into Fenrir Greyback who takes one sniff at him, looks at the shard of the philosopher\u2019s stone hanging from his neck and shakes his head in disbelief. \"Chaos,\" the man mutters going up the stairs, \"utter chaos.\"\u00a0</p>\n<p>Harry doesn't ask for clarification.</p>\n<p>Partly because he knows and partly because he doesn't want to initiate conversation with the other man.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Despite popular belief, Harry <em> knows </em> how it looks. He's wearing the shard, telling everyone where his alliance stands, where he belongs. But he's also walking around completely cloaked in Sirius's scent. Which, by the way, anyone with a magically sensitive nose can smell.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Oh well.</p>\n<p>That's future Harry\u2019s problem.</p>\n<p>Present Harry just wants some much needed treacle tart. He's earned it after that good nap from earlier. Blissfully ignorant of the consequences he's just made by ignoring his problems, Harry steps into the kitchen with light steps and a dreamy smile.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He's met with the sight of Tom sitting at a small, circular table drinking tea. The first few buttons of his shirt are undone and his sleeves are rolled up to his elbows, showing off his veiny, muscled arms.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Harry would have noticed his slightly dishevelled appearance and the obviously dead body covered with a dark blanket in the far corner of the room if, IF, there wasn't a full tray of warm treacle tart on the table obviously made just for him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"Tom,\" Harry breathes out, enthralled, \"you shouldnt have.\" He grins almost wolfishly as he takes a seat beside Tom, effectively blocking out his view of the dead body.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tom's eyebrow twitches. He places his teacup onto the table and visibly straightens. \"Harry,\" he says, \"do not call me by that name.\"\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"Well, I'm not calling you Voldermort,\" Harry quips, sticking a spoon into the tray of treacle tart. He brings it back around to him mouth and completely falls in love with the sweet, creamy and lucious taste all over again. \"I could call you Timothy?\" He teases, licking the spoon. \"Or Toby? Tia? Tabitha?\"\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tom closes his eyes and his chest strains with the movement of a deep breath. Harry watches fascinated at how Tom's knuckles turn white and how the air around him sparks with electricity. Whe he opens his eyes, it's like thousand of glaciers smashing against each other and creating a whirlpool of emotions.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"Marvolo,\" Tom insits, leaning closer to Harry. He lifts his hand to cradle the side of his head, warm and gentle. \"I could kill you for your cheek,\" he murmurs, delighted when Harry's breath hitches between them.</p>\n<p>Harry leans into the touch like a cat, not the least bit afraid. His spoon drops onto the table with a loud clatter. \"Mhhm,\" he hums, \"I know, Tom.</p>\n<p>Something in the air snaps. Tom moves like a deadly cobra, strong and swift. He wraps a hand tightly around Harry's neck and <em> squeezes, </em> gazing at him with wild, red eyes full of deadly fury.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tom breathes in deeply. \"You smell like a dog,\" he idly comments, like he's not about to twist his hand and snap Harry's neck like a twig.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Harry laughs, though it's more of a splutter of coughs. His lips twist into a impish smile, wide and full of teeth and his green eyes alight with amusement. The hand on his neck tightens even more and Harry relishes in the feeling, wraps his own hands around Tom's and just\u2026 settles there -- like it's a common occurance that he gets strangled.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tom's other hand settles onto Harry\u2019s cheek and his thumb softly, tenderly swipes across his bottom lip, effectively smearing the dried blood from earlier. Tom brings it around to his mouth to lick at, his fiery gaze never once leaving Harry\u2019s.\u00a0</p>\n<p>For a moment, Tom looks utterly blissful, and then he leans down to lick a long, wet stripe across Harry's cheek.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He pulls back with a satisfied smirk and only when he sees Harry starting to flutter his pretty eyes closed, only then, does he retreat his hand. \"Others would have begged for their lives,\" Tom says over Harry's gasps and coughs.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Harry laughs, quiet and soft and slightly hysterical. He holds a hand over his neck, it's tender to the touch, already bruising black and purple. He sighs, all gooey and dreamy. \"Oh please, if you had really wanted wanted kill me,\" he sighs even dreamier, lowering his voice to a dramatic whisper, \"you wouldn't have chocked me.\"\u00a0</p>\n<p>Harry shrugs a shoulder, nonchalant. He stands to his feet and carefully stands between Tom's legs. \"That's fine,\" Harry says, looping his arms around Tom's broad shoulders, \"you can do whatever you want, Tom. After all, I am your horcrux, aren't I?\"</p>\n<p>Tom swipes a tongue over his lips hungrily. His eyes are dark as he wraps his arms around Harry's waist. His voice is overly soft as he speaks, \"My clever little horcrux. Are you manipulating me?\"\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"Just a little,\" Harry says, hiding a smile into Tom's wavy hair. He smells fresh, like grass after heavy rainfall, but also like spilt ink over parchment and new books. \"But only because you're manipulating me too.\"\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Chapter Twenty-Four:\u00a0</strong>\n</p>\n<p><em>\"I can't believe this,\"</em> Verde hisses from where he's nestled between Ron's orange hair. <em>\"I can't believe you didn't ask Sirius what he was doing at that wretched things place or, OR, whether or not Sirius was your legal guardian.\"</em></p>\n<p><em>\"Verde--,\"</em> Harry tries to say but gets cut off for the millionth time.</p>\n<p><em>\"No,\"</em> Verde seethes.<em> \"No. You cannot talk, Master. Not until I've gotten this all out of my system. How could you be THAT stupid? HOW?\"</em></p>\n<p>\"He's been hissing at you all day,\" Ron says, moving a pawn piece across the chessboard. \"What did you do?\" He asks.</p>\n<p>\"It's more of what I didn't do,\" Harry answers quietly. He moves his own pawn piece across the chessboard and then sags into his yellow chair dramatically. \"I can't believe I'm being chastised by my own familiar,\" he groans.\u00a0</p>\n<p><em>\"And do you know what I call that?\"</em> Verde continues on like Harry and Ron hadn't just talked over him, <em>\"bullshit, that's what.\"</em></p>\n<p>\"I, um,\" Ron hesitates for a moment, biting into his bottom lip. He eventually picks up his knight and moves it across the board. \"I noticed that, um,\" he lowers his voice into a whisper, \"Hannah Abbott and her friends keep staring at you.\"\u00a0</p>\n<p>Harry flickers his gaze across the Hufflepuff common room and speaks in a flat tone, \"I've noticed.\"\u00a0</p>\n<p>It's hard not to. Abbott and her two friends, Macmillan and Finch-Fletchley are way too easy to notice. It's almost like they want Harry to see, but, well, he's not interested. He already has a group of friends who force him to eat when he forgets to and take him on walks around Hogwarts like he's some sort of pet they're trying really hard to keep alive.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Ironic, really.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Harry's life has always been one big joke.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"I'm not interested in them,\" Harry says, turning his gaze back to Ron. \"You want to know what I'm really interested in, though?\"</p>\n<p>Ron sighs deeply. \"Treacle tart,\" he replies monotonically.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"Exactly,\" Harry preens. He stands to his feet and beckons Ron to follow. \"I've been without my precious treacle tart for the past three hours,\" he pauses to make a weirdly realistic sobbing sound, \"how have I even survived up until now?\"\u00a0</p>\n<p>Ron follows after him with an exasperated yet fond expression. From atop his head, Verde has not once stopped his assault on Harry. <em>\"Are you even listening to me? Hello? See, this is exactly why you can't get shit done. Master! Master!!\"</em></p>\n<p><em>\"When are you going to stop?\"</em> Harry whines, pushing past a door and then walking down a short passage. He shoves a few barrels out of his way and ends up in the kitchens. <em>\"I understand, really, it's just not that easy.\"</em></p>\n<p><em>\"Oh, it's easy,\"</em> Verde sasses him. <em>\"All you have to do is ask.\"</em></p>\n<p>Harry groans loudly and rolls his green eyes. <em>\"I can't help it, okay? I get into a trance and then, well,\"</em> he stops talking when his face heats up in embarrassment.\u00a0</p>\n<p><em>\"Uh huh,\"</em> Verde hums. <em>\"You get doped up on endorphins and your brain cells, all two of them, just stop working. Whether it's with the homicidal moron or with the dumb dog.\"</em></p>\n<p><em>\"Sirius isn't dumb,\"</em> Harry defends his godfather. He leads Ron to a small table in the middle of the kitchen that the Hogwarts elves have prepared for them.<em> \"And I can't even say anything about Tom because it's true.\"</em></p>\n<p>\"Here's be Mr Harry's treacle, Sirs,\" an elf pops beside the table and places a whole tray of beautiful, beautiful treacle tart onto it.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"Thank you,\" Harry and Ron chorus, falling into their seats with small smiles. The elf pops away and Harry instantly inhales his treacle tart. Ron eats his share a lot slower.\u00a0</p>\n<p><em>\"You're being daft,\"</em> Verde compliments Harry oh so sweetly, <em>\"how is it that you're still alive, Master?\"</em>\u00a0</p>\n<p><em>\"It's because of my hair,\"</em> Harry answers seriously. <em>\"But you're right, I am being daft. It's because it's fun this way. I like going to see Tom and finding a dead body on the floor and just pretending not to see it.\"</em></p>\n<p><em>\"Sweet Salazar,\"</em> Verde sighs. Harry gets the feeling that if Verde could, he'd roll his eyes.\u00a0</p>\n<p><em>\"What's wrong with me just doing what I want to?\"</em> Harry asks, scrunching up his nose. He shoves a whole spoon of treacle into his mouth to calm himself down and the effect is instant.\u00a0</p>\n<p><em>\"Master, you can do whatever the fuck you want,\"</em> Verde says, <em>\"I'm just worried, Nimmy is worried, that you'll get hurt.\"</em></p>\n<p>\n<em>\"Physically or emotionally? Because the damage is already there and--\"</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\"Master.\"\u00a0</em>\n</p>\n<p><em>\"Fine,\"</em> Harry relents. <em>\"I'll be more careful.\"</em></p>\n<p><em>\"And what about finding your legal guardian?</em>\" Verde asks.\u00a0</p>\n<p><em>\"The papers should have already been here,\" </em>Harry explains. <em>\"I don't think Gringotts is the type of bank to forget. How about we stop by there during the holidays?\"</em></p>\n<p><em>\"Fine.\"</em> Verde parrots. He slithers down Ron's head, down his arm and over the table to wrap around Harry's wrist.</p>\n<p>\"So,\" Ron voices when he notices that Verde is no longer hissing at Harry, \"you okay?\"</p>\n<p>\"Yeah,\" Harry nods. \"Just got a question. Has Gringotts ever forgotten to send someone their hereditary results?\"\u00a0</p>\n<p>Ron blinks owlishly at him and swallows slowly around his treacle tart. There are a few stray crumbs on his bottom lip that have Harry wanting to reach over and wipe them off. \"Um,\" Ron blinks again, \"I don't think so?\" He tilts his head cutely. \"That would mean putting their money at risk. And erm, Goblins are very territorial over their gold.\"</p>\n<p>\"Ronnie, sweetie,\" Harry teases, grinning when Ron's face pinkens. \"Do you want to go see Draco?\" It's the least Harry can do for him and his cute face and his adorable crush--</p>\n<p>Ron makes a punched out noise and hides his reddening face into his hands. \"Please stop teasing me.\"\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"Sorry, sorry,\" Harry laughs good-naturedly. He's content like this, willing to spend his days teasing Ron and making Hermione question their friendship. Willing to have Draco hover around him like a doting mother and to have the other baby death eaters arguing behind his back as they collectively walk to class.\u00a0</p>\n<p>It's a weird concept for him; happiness. What does it really feel like? Is happiness seeing Draco muster up to courage to hold Ron's hand? Or is it seeing Blaise and Theo arguing with Pansy only to have Tracy split them up when it turns nasty? Is happiness falling into Sirius's arms and soaking up all the warmth that he can? Is happiness sitting in Tom's lap and laughing and arguing and forgiving things that shouldn't be forgiven?\u00a0</p>\n<p>Harry thinks it <em>might</em> be.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Harry <em>wants</em> it to be.\u00a0</p>\n<p>And so it <em>is</em>.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n<b>Chapter Twenty-Five\u00a0</b>\n</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Harry writes a letter to Sirius under the careful eye of Verde, who occasionally slaps him across the wrist with his green tail in reprimand when he forgets to write important questions that he, <em>apparently</em>, desperately needs answers to.\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><em>\"This is for the best,\"</em> Verde says, as Harry fastens the letter around Hedwig\u2019s raised leg. She hoots at them before she spreads her snowy wings apart and flies off, the flap of her wings loud. <em>\"You'll thank me later,\"</em> Verde insists.\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Harry sighs for the umpteenth time. He doesn't know how to tell Verde that he just doesn't care. So what if Sirius is playing buddy, buddy with Tom? At least he's not in Azkaban, <em>or worse,</em> dead, <em>or even worse</em>, being reprimanded by a snake who thinks they know everything.\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><em>\"Okay, okay,\"</em> Harry grumbles, leaving the owlery in favour of getting to the Library. He's already late to his nap appointment with Hermione. He doesn't think he can live if she starts nagging at him as well. <em>Dear Salazar,</em> Harry internally begs, <em>have mercy on me.\u00a0</em></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">When he does arrive at the Library, he's met with the sight of his friends sitting around a long table they must have transfigured to make space for all of them. There's a translucent sheen around them, which must be a silencing charm. Harry groans in despair. \"What is this?''</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\"It's an intervention,\" Tracey answers. For once, her head isn't stuck inside a book. The clips he had gotten her for Christmas are pinning back her hair, giving way to her eyes that are staring at Harry with narrowness.\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\"An intervention,\" Harry deadpans, not the least bit amused or interested. Salazar has no mercy to give him, it seems. \"Pretty please let it be about Draco and Ron?\" He tries.\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\"Sorry,\" Theodore smiles, not looking apologetic at all. Beside him, Draco\u2019s face turns into a tomato.\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\"Me and Draco?\" Ron asks, tilting his head to the side cutely like the little bean of innocence that he is. There's a chorus of groans all around the table. Harry <em>feels</em> for them, but also doesn't. Let them be in pain too, if only for a moment.\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\"Harry, sit,\" Hermione orders, pulling out the chair beside her. She's got her, <em>'if you don't listen to me, I'll make every aspect of your life painful,' </em>face on, so Harry falls into the chair with a loud, drawn out sigh.\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\"This intervention is yours,\" the bushy haired girl says, patting Harry on the back sympathetically. \"And it's about how you can't take care of yourself and make stupid decisions, like hugging Dark Lords that are not supposed to be hugged.\"</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\"And in public,\" Blaise adds, shaking his head from side to side in disappointment.\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\"That was one time!\" Harry defends himself, heat rushing to his cheeks. \"<em>One</em> time!\"\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">He receives skeptical looks from all around the table, but Harry ignores them by rolling his eyes. \"Ok,\" he relents, \"you can continue.\"</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\"Honestly,\" Pansy voices, scrunching up her nose, \"how are you not dead yet?\"\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\"He must have been dropped in a bath of Liquid Luck when he was a baby,\" Draco says, leaning his chin into the palm of his hand thoughtfully, \"it's the only possible explanation.\"\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\"Right,\" Tracey nods, \"that's what I thought.\"\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\"Really?\" Theodore makes a face. \"I just thought he got out of uncomfortable and unexplainable situations because of his colour changing hair.\"\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\"It's just a trick of the light,\" Pansy insists.\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">There's a noise of agreement around the table and Harry drops his head into his hands. <em>Oh for the love of\u2014</em></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\"Maybe all the treacle tart he's been eating has made him invincible?\" Ron joins the discussion with his own theory. Sweet, innocent, cinnamon roll Ron who's supposed to be Harry\u2019s best friend. It's official, Harry's done for.\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\"He has been eating a lot of it,\" Pansy agrees. \"I think it's the only thing that he does eat. Has anyone seen him eat anything else?\"\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">There's silence around the table. Harry peeks through his fingers to see his friends shooting each other worried glances. Harry has eaten other foods, it's just that he'd eaten them\u2026 <em>not on the premises of Hogwarts.</em> He thinks back to Bellatrix and her soft smile and all the foods she made for him. It's better if he just stays silent and doesn't tell them anything lest he slips up and mentions Tom around them.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">What has his life come to?\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\"Well,\" Draco clears his throat to talk, \"I've seen him eat chicken and gravy a few times, but if I remember correctly,\" he pauses to scratch at his cheek, \"it was a really long time ago.\"</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\"Yes, thank you,\" Hermione's voice turns sharp. \"Very helpful.\"</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Harry stands to his feet before an all out brawl can happen. He's pretty sure Hermione would win, <em>but</em> <em>still</em>. He doesn't want to see his friends, <em>mainly Draco,</em> hiding from Hermione until the end of the school year and quite possibly for the rest of the years to come. \"Right, listen up,\" Harry glances around the table to see if he has their attention and only then continues, \"I'll start eating better. Hermione, you can come up with a weekly menu for me, yeah? I'll try and keep up with it.\"\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">There's a nod from Hermione and a gleam in her eyes that has Harry momentarily wishing he'd chosen someone else for the job. But whatever. You win some, you lose some.\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\"Blaise, I promise not to hug Dark Lords out in public. How does that sound?\"</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Blaise seems to think it over before he shrugs. \"It depends if you'll actually keep to your promise,\" he grumbles. And then he looks like he wants to say something else, probably about the fact that hugging Dark Lords in private rooms is still on the table, but Harry sends him a dark, <em>dark</em>, glare and that shuts him up immediately.\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\"Pansy, Theodore,\" Harry calls, giving them his best exasperated look, \"drop the hair comments or I'll get <em>mad</em>. They're getting old.\"\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\"Draco,\" Harry does his best to look as disappointed as he can. All the expression changing is giving him whiplash, but it's what he does best \u2014 pretending to have emotions. \"You've <em>greatly</em> hurt my feelings today,\" he says, \"and as punishment, you'll be denied my presence for two, <em>NAY</em>, three days.\"\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Draco lets out a loud cry. \"No! You can't do that!\" He looks absolutely terrified. \"What am I supposed to do?\" He asks, looking crestfallen. \"Oh no, I'm going to have to be nice to Pansy. I can't do that. Harry, <em>please</em>\u2014\"\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Harry raises his hand to shush the blonde. \"Quite now. I've already decided.\" Okay, maybe he's enjoying this a little bit too much\u2026</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Ah. Well, desperate times call for desperate measures.\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\"Tracey, sweetie,\" Harry's voice turns saccharine sweet. Around the table, his friends visibly shudder. \"The next time you call an intervention and it <em>isn't</em> about Ron and Draco, I will be greatly <em>disappointed</em> in <em>you</em>. Understood?\"\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Tracey blinks at him, slow and purposeful, like she's trying to figure out if what he's saying is true or not. Eventually she nods her head hesitantly. <em>Good</em>, Harry doesn\u2019t think he can say all that bullshit again. Having attention on him and controlling it sure is tiring.\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\"Excellent,\" Harry beams, \"Who's next?\"\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">From beside Hermione, Ron slowly raises his hand, looking bashful.\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\"Ronnie,\" Harry sighs, \"you haven't done anything wrong. Everyone else just dragged you down and you caved in on the peer pressure, I understand.\"</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Ron\u2019s bashfulness turns into confusion. \"But I\u2014\"</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\"Of course I forgive you,\" Harry continues on like Ron hadn't just interrupted him. From the other side of the table Pansy rolls her eyes and Harry sends her a warning glare. <em>I dare you,</em> he challenges, <em>say something. Go on.</em></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">She doesn't. Harry takes his win.\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\"I know,\" Harry drags a flustered Ron out of his seat, \"let's go play some chess, hmm? It'll make you feel better,\" and then he's dragging the orange haired boy away, aware of all the incredulous stares following after him.\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\"Did we just get manipulated?\" Blaise asks, voice filled with disbelief.\u00a0<br>\u00a0<br>Pansy looks somewhat proud. \"They grow up so fast,\" she says, wiping a fake, stray tear away.\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\"I'm,\" Hermione pauses to think of the right word, \"<em>disgusted</em>.\" She certainly looks like it.\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\"We all walked right into his little manipulation without a second thought,\" Theodore says, looking around the table to take in everyone's expressions. Everyone feels different about getting manipulated by Harry. It's a <em>weird</em> experience.\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">There's a moment of silence before Draco hurries to stand. In a frustrated voice, he yells, \"my father will hear about this!\"\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Theodore trades a look with Tracey and hopes she feels as much annoyance as he does.\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">By the look on her face, she absolutely does.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n<b>Chapter Twenty-Six:</b>\n</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Easter comes and goes. The cold, sharp weather starts to turn softer, warmer and Harry enjoys seeing beautiful flowers sprout, snow melting across colourful petals. He walks across the courtyard slowly, Hermione by his side.\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">((Before Harry returned from the week-long holiday, he had a rather awkward affair with Griphook, his accounting manager.\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\"I'm truly sorry, Mr Potter,\" Griphook frantically looks through scrolls, throwing one after another behind his back, \"this has <em>never</em> happened before. Your inheritance results were here just a moment ago.\"\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Harry stares at Griphook, growing with unease. He had waited for <em>months</em> to get here, for a slot to finally open so he could get an inheritance test done. Gringotts was apparently <em>always</em> busy, bustling with wizards and witches of all ages, coming in every day of every hour to complain about one thing or another.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\"The Potter luck strikes again,\" Harry says, absolutely serious. Griphook doesn't seem to hear him over the sound of scrolls snapping open and shutting all at once.\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Harry doesn't bother raising his voice over all the noise. He simply takes the knife he had been given earlier, slices his palm open and holds it over special Goblin Parchment. At once, it fills with information, his blood forming words and drawing an intricate family tree.\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Harry catches sight of the words <em>'half-blood,' 'Potter-Black'</em> and '<em>soul bond,'</em> before the Goblin Parchment, <em>once again,</em> swiftly scrolls itself shut and simply <em>vanishes</em>. The air around Harry turns <em>cold</em> and when he exhales, his breath swirls in front of him.\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In his next breath, the air around him goes back to its warmth. The situation could not be more weirder. After gaining Griphook's attention and coming to an agreement of scheduling another appointment, Harry leaves Gringotts in favour of taking a nice, long and well deserved nap.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Having no information on his legal guardian was future Harry\u2019s problem. Present Harry just wanted to <em>sleep.)</em>)</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\"I can't do it,\" Hermione says, catching Harry\u2019s attention with her stressed voice. She shoves thick tomes into her side bag, \"there's no way I can learn all of this material for the end of year exams.\"\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Harry smiles, amused. \"Mione, you went over the material as soon as you got your Hogwarts letter. What are you even worried about?\"</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\"I'm not worried,'' Hermione sniffs. There's a twitch in her lips before she lowers her voice to ask, \"what if I forget everything as soon as I sit down to take the test?\"</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\"Trust me,\" Harry says, looking at the Ravenclaw fondly, \"you won't.\"</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Hermione sighs. It's a short, sharp sound that has Harry laughing quietly. \"Enough of that,\" he says, stepping back into the warmth of the castle. He looks up and down the corridor before he flicks out his wand and casts a simple silencing ward. The magic shimmers around Harry and Hermione before it turns transparent.\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">They continue walking in comfortable silence, Hermione breathing softly into her hands to warm them up quickly. There's a small frown etched into her lips when she's done. Harry glances at the girl's hands to find her nails have considerably darkened and turned a weird hue. How odd. They weren't like that before the Easter Holidays.\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\"Are you making any progress with your nonverbal magic?\" Harry asks, breaking his and Hermione's bubble of quietness.\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\"A little,\" Hermione says, hiding her hands into the pockets of her robes. \"I can levitate small objects now,\" there's a scrunch of her nose, obviously in disappointment, \"but larger objects are proving to be trickier.\"</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\"It takes time,\" Harry reassures the girl. \"Did you try casting any wandless spells?\"\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">They turn a corner and walk past a group of older Ravenclaw's who send Hermione fleeting looks. Harry's upper lip curls in distaste. Was there something dangerous going on in the Ravenclaw common room that Harry wasn't aware of? He'd have to find out later.\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\"I've tried,\" Hermione sighs again, this time longer and annoyed, \"and failed. I'm starting to think I don't have any talent for it.\"\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\"It's not about talent,\" Harry says, leading her up a set of moving stairs, \"it's about your will. Wandless magic is hard, sure, but if you've got enough will, the world's in the palm of your hand.\"\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Behind him, Hermione's voice is curious and she almost sounds like a wounded animal, not quite believing him, \"my will?\"\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Harry smiles, pausing in his steps to wait for the stairs to turn and connect to others. \"You have to <em>want</em> it,\" He explains. The stairs connect and Harry walks down them, Hermione's footsteps echoing after his own. They stumble into Seamus Finnigan who takes one look at Hermione and runs, metaphorical tail tucked between his legs in fear.\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The incident in which Hermione tried to strangle him for his, '<em>potion making ineptitude,</em>' has no doubt scarred him for life.\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Harry sends his condolences.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\"When I use wandless magic, I think of the spell I want to use,\" Harry takes the last step down and holds out his hand for Hermione to take. She places her hand into his palm and Harry leads her down a long, dimly lit corridor. Hermione's nails are no longer the weird, greenish blue hue they were a few minutes ago and Harry blinks, filing the information for later.\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\"It's simple, really. I want to use the spell, therefore I put all of my <em>want</em> into it. There's nothing complex about it.\"\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Hermione makes a face. \"It's easy for you,\" she says, \"because you defy all logic that this world holds.''\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Harry can't disagree with her on that. He humours her, \"I didn't think this world held any logic. Maybe that's what you need to do, ignore the logic and ignore the rationality. Just stop thinking and <em>want</em>.\"\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\"You want me to be more like you,\" Hermione deadpans. \"I can't do that. I have yet to meet a Dark Lord that I can hug and not get killed by\u2026 the second time.\"\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\"Wow,\" Harry is mildly surprised and somewhat proud, \"low blow, Mione, low blow.\"</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\"Where are you even taking me?\" Hermione asks, steering the conversation away before they get into another deep conversion on how Harry\u2019s extremely lucky to be alive. The conversation usually leads them into an argument and she doesn't feel like having one today. Maybe tomorrow, she muses.\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\"To the dungeons,\" Harry answers, \"you're too worried about not passing the exams and getting expelled. So, I'm taking you to Tracey. She can help you.\"</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">They take another set of stairs, even deeper down into the castle. These stairs are made of solid rock, no magic moving them from one side to another. The lit up torches on the stone walls are burning with green fire, casting the stairs in an eerie glow.\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Eventually they come to a landing and move down several stone passages, moving in complicated lines that have Hermione's mind whirling. This deep down in the dungeons, there are no doors that lead them to classrooms or portraits hung upon walls to stare at them and whisper to each other. There's just <em>nothing</em>.\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\"Harry,\" Hermione glances at the boy, brows furrowed, she asks, \"are we lost?\"\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\"No,\" Harry chuckles, halting to a stop. He rubs his thumb across the back of Hermione's hand to comfort her. \"Relax,\" he murmurs, \"if we ever do get lost, I'll protect you.\"\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Oblivious to the flush rising to Hermione's cheeks, Harry turns to the wall on their left and says the password, \"belladonna,\" to give them access to the Slytherin common room. They step inside and immediately are welcomed by the warmth from the fireplace and many, many unreadable stares.\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\"Ignore them,\" Harry says, lowering his voice. He dispels his silencing ward and leads Hermione to the fireplace where Tracey's head peeks out from above a stack of books. She peers at them from behind messy bangs, mouth twisting into a small smile. \"Harry, Granger,\" she greets.\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\"Davis,\" Hermione nods, settling beside the girl. She pulls out her own stack of books and then they're both working, swapping notes between each other and scribbling onto their respective parchments.\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\"I'll be back for you in a few hours,\" Harry says, knowing fully well neither Tracey nor Hermione can hear him from the deep confines of their studying.\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As Harry leaves the common room, he throws a glare over his shoulder, dark and full of promised pain if anyone does anything remotely unacceptable to Hermione. Unbeknownst to him, his green eyes light up eerily, taking the exact shade of the killing curse.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">That day, the Slytherins in the common room keep far away from Hermione Granger and avoid making eye contact with each other, unsure if what they saw was real or not.\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><b>Chapter Twenty-Seven</b>: (<em>jfc how did we even get up to this point??)</em></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Harry gets a letter from Sirius. When he opens it, he finds a drawing of Tom and Sirius laughing over some poor man's dead body. The details are very odd and specific. He immediately shows it to Verde who thwarts at it with his tail and sends it flying across the Slytherin table.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Before Harry can even react, Blaise is picking the drawing from between bowls of soup and peering down at it with furrowed brows. He then folds it and slowly passes it back to Harry, saying, \"I didn't see anything and I don't know anything. In fact, I'm partially blind--\"</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\"Please stop,\" Harry begs, shoving the drawing into his side bag. \"We both know you're <em>fully</em> blinde.\"</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\"Right, yes,\" Blaise nods and returns to eating his food like he hadn't just seen two sociopaths, <em>maybe</em> psychopaths, Harry isn't quite sure yet, bonding over murder. Granted, it's just a drawing, but still, a very detailed drawing nonetheless. Sirius really didn't have to add the spilling guts and the dismembered fingers... and <em>oh shit,</em> Harry hurries to pull out the drawing once more and <em>yup</em>, that's fucking Peter Pettigrew, those <em>motherfuckers</em> got to him before he could.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">No wonder Verde and Nimmy couldn't find a rat with a missing toe on the premises of Hogwarts, Peter Pettigrew was <em>already</em> dead.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Well what the hell was Harry supposed to look forward to now? He huffs in annoyance and hastily scribbles a message above the drawing -- '<em>what </em><em>the</em><em> fuck </em><em>guys</em><em>, i wanted to do that</em>' --- and makes his way towards the owlery with a scowl. Once the parchment is tied around Hedwig\u2019s leg, he sends his girl off.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><em>\"</em><em>You're</em><em> angry,\" </em>Nimmy notes from where she's wrapped around Harry\u2019s neck, her tongue flicks against the hollow of his throat and Harry\u2019s scowl deepens. <em>\"Angry isn't quite the word </em><em>I</em><em> would use,\" </em>he says, \"<em>I'm</em><em> displeased because </em><em>I</em><em> wasted my time on searching for a rat that was already dead.\" </em></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Harry walks out of the owlery with an oncoming headache<em>,\"and there was so much potential for me to release all my pent up frustration and suddenly--\"</em></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><em>\"Master,\"</em> Nimmy tightens her coils around Harry\u2019s neck, <em>\"</em><em>Relax</em><em>, we'll find another rat to </em><em>play</em><em> with.\" </em></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><em>\"</em><em>There's</em> <em>plenty</em><em> to chose from,\"</em> Verde adds from around Harry\u2019s wrist. \"<em>We've</em><em> a school full of them. Personally </em><em>I'd</em><em> like to see that Longbottom boy cry.\"</em></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><em>\"How dull,\"</em> if Nimmy could roll her eyes she would, <em>\"I insist on it being that good for nothing rabbit--\" </em></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><em>\"Agreed,\"</em> Verde cuts in, suddenly heated. <em>\"The nosy rabbit goes first.\" </em></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Harry falters in his steps for a moment before he shakes his head<em>. \"The what?\"</em> He asks, turning the corner to head towards Transfiguration.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><em>\"A rabbit, </em> <em>from</em> <em> the forest--\"</em></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n<em>\"Snotty, nosy, arrogant--\" </em>\n</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n<em>\"We want it dead Master, dead.\"</em>\n</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><em>\"Mainly me,\"</em> Nimmy confesses.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n<em>\"Mainly her.\" </em>\n</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Harry chuckles. <em>\"And how is it that the two of you can't catch it and do the deed yourselves?\" </em></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\"<em>It's...,\"</em> Nimmy trails off, sounding small and ashamed, <em>\"bigger than us.\"</em></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Dumbfounded, Harry halts to a stop. He leans against the wall beside him, shoulder to stone and raises his hand to his mouth to\u00a0stifle his laughter. It takes a moment, but he eventually manages to speak, \"<em>bigger than you?\" </em></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\"<em>Yes!\"</em> Verde pouts, poking out his snout from beneath Harry's sleeve. He sounds awfully serious.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Harry imagines two venomous snakes losing against a fucking rabbit and he hastily coughs to cover up his laughs. \"<em>So... this rabbit... it's bullying you?\" </em></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><em>\"Master...,\"</em> Verde sound like a small child on the verge of tears, \"<em>it wants to eat us.\"</em></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">What a fucking riot. A rabbit that wants to eat snakes. Fucking hell.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Still, Harry bites into the inside of his cheek and makes a humming sound to appease his familiars. He can't help but imagine some sort of huge rabbit with beady eyes and big, sharp teeth---</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\"Harry? What in Merlin's name are you doing?\"</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\"Er...\" Harry turns to find Hermione looking at him with the eyes of a tired mother. The girl sighs and then holds up her hands, motioning for him to keep quiet. \"Nevermind,\" the Ravenclaw shakes her head, \"it's better if I don't know.\"</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\"Probably,\" Harry grins. \"Let's go,\" he says, \"I want to sit with you today.\"</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Hermione's cheeks turn into a dusty shade of pink and she mutters something incoherent underneath her breath. Whatever it is, she seems to grow embarrassed and hastily starts walking down the corridor.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\"What's wrong with her?\" Harry asks himself, quirking a brow. He follows after Hermione, albeit at a slower pace.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\"<em>Master</em>,\" Nimmy reminds, \"<em>the rabbit.\"</em></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\"<em>Yeah, yeah,\"</em> Harry smiles, \"<em>I'll</em><em> deal with it after lessons.\" </em></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><em>\"Thank you,\" </em>his familiars chorus and Harry hums, taking a seat beside Hermione in the front row. Other students start slowly trickling in and Harry momentarily closes his eyes, enjoying the quiet bustling of early Transfiguration mornings.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">When the day is over, Harry sneaks out at night under a strong notice me not charm. He takes stairways and corridors he knows will be empty, having already memorised his Professors walks in his past life. He passes a few portraits gossiping about the lows and highs of Pureblood life and Harry tunes them out in favour of stepping outside. <em>\"Alright,\" </em>he says, <em>\"</em><em>let's</em><em> find that carnivorous rabbit of yours.\" </em></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">He carefully makes his way into the forbidden forest, the cold night air nips at his skin. Harry casts a heating charm onto his sweater, having learned that taking robes into the forest would just slow him down. Branches and roots have a life of their own, after all. He ends up going deeper into the forest than he'd first expected, Nimmy and Verde leading him.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Harry eyes some suspicious movement to his left and hears the sound of rustling leaves.<em>\"If </em><em>I</em><em> get killed, tell Draco </em><em>he's</em><em> a pussy.\"</em></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Verde sighs. <em>\"Master, he already knows </em><em>he's</em><em> a pussy.\" </em></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><em>\"I can confirm,\"</em> Nimmy says, sounding absolutely sure. Harry wonders if she's seen the blonde talking to himself in the mirror--</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><em>\"Over there!\"</em> Verde hisses.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Harry makes his way into a small clearing. He looks around to see dried, muddy grass that crunches underneath his shoes as he walks and peculiar blue flowers that glow at him eerily. From above, thick branches from neighbouring looming trees move ever so slowly, creating a soft whistling soud that disappears with the wind.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Suddenly the image of a large, hideous rabbit with sharp teeth doesn't seem so funny anymore. Harry can feel sweat forming on his lower back. Merlin, he hates things like this.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\"<em>Look!\" Nimmy hisses. \"</em><em>It's</em><em> there!\"</em></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Harry zeroes his eyes onto a small form coming out from between bushes. It's pristine white fur has no dirt to be found on it and when it raises its small head, it's black eyes make direct eye contact with Harry's own green ones. There's no fear to be found in them, all Harry can see is pitch black darkness. Something about being on the receiving\u00a0 end of the stare has him taking a cautious step back.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">To be afraid of a rabbit... Harry never thought he'd be here, and yet.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\"Master,\" the rabbit speaks, voice soft and low, almost like a whisper but not quite. Something about its tone has Harry\u2019s skin rising in goosebumps. \"Long time no see.\"</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Completely lost, all Harry can manage is, \"Long time no... <em>what</em>?\"</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n<em>1290 words//unedited.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Chapter Twenty-Eight:\u00a0</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"Fuck me,\" Harry says, blinking owlishly, \"I've seen a lot of things but a talking rabbit... I must have gone <em>utterly</em> mad.\"</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\"Mad?\" The white rabbit echoes, inching ever so slowly into the clearing, \"no, of course not, Master. You're simply seeing what you're supposed to see.\"</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><em>\"He always does this,\"</em> Verde sounds like he's on the verge of tears, \"<em>it's so cold. Tell him to fuck off.\"\u00a0</em></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Right on cue, Harry feels another chill run down his spine. Hadn't he casted a heating charm just a while ago? What the fuck was going on? He should have ignored his familiars and just stayed inside. Harry momentarily imagines the warm comfort of his bed and curses his brain cells (all two of them) for getting him into his current situation.\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\"Right,\" Harry pinches the bridge of his nose and closes his eyes, \"this is obviously just a dream. A very fucked up dream, but a dream nonetheless. All I have to do is wake up, so--\"</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">There's the sound cracking, loud and abrupt, and Harry hurries to snap his mouth shut. He doesn't dare open his eyes, for the cracking sounds like that of breaking bones -- a sound he's all too familiar with. There are other sounds too, whispery breaths and what Harry thinks might be the shift of muscles.\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Finally, the awful noises come to an end and Harry releases a breath he didn't know he'd been holding in. There is cold sweat on the back of his neck and it trails down his back uncomfortably.\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\"Master,\" the rabbit... touches his cheek? Harry shivers, every nerve on high alert as he feels fiery, hot fingers slowly trace his jaw. Harry slowly peels his eyes open and his heart stutters in his ribcage, green eyes widening in fright.\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">He finds a skeleton-like hand settling around his cheek, the elongated fingers reaching way past his hair, and follows it up onto a cloak so dark, it looks like it's blending into its surroundings and then, finally, onto a face made of pure, white bone. No, not quite a face... more of a mask of sorts, with the left side curving into a set of large, pointy teeth and the right curving into smooth bone.\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Sharp eyes flash golden underneath the shadows of the man's -- was it even a man? -- cranial orbit and Harry feels his cheeks turn warm in embarrassment because this isn't <em>his</em> fear he's feeling, it's his <em>scars</em> fear. Which begs the question...</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\"Are you Death?\" Harry asks, voice weirdly high and breathy. He can hear the onslaught of his heartbeat drumming in his ears and it is loud and clear, like a dozen of drums all being played at the same time. \"You are, aren't you,\" Harry says, a growing sense of deja vu forking its way through his muddled thoughts.\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">He\u2026 <em>remembers</em>, but he's not sure what. Or who. Or anything, for that matter. It's like looking into a fogged up mirror, the silhouette is there, but not much else. Harry's scar suddenly burns in warning, but he ignores it in favour of squinting up at Death.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><em>\"Master\u2026\"</em> Nimmy\u2019s hiss is hesitant, small, <em>\"you know this being?\"\u00a0</em></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\"<em>Yeah,\"</em> Harry answers, <em>\"I just\u2026\"</em> ugh. The frustration he feels is messy, it's like all the answers are on the tip of his tongue but he just can't seem to get a grip on them. Harry squints his eyes even more at Death, emerald meets gold and a metaphorical light bulb turns on right above Harry's messy hair.\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\"<em>Oh</em>,\" Harry's face morphs into one of anger, \"Oh I <em>fucking know you</em>.\"\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">He slaps the offending hand away from his face and instead pushes at Death's chest with all his power, \"you absolutely <em>fucking</em> cunt<em>, I hate you,</em> I hate you, I fucking hate you!\"</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Not the least bit surprised, Death takes a step back, letting his Master push him away. \"Master\u2013\"</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\"No!\" Harry hisses, his green eyes eerily glowing. \"<em>Shut up,</em> shut the fuck up. I told you, didn't I? I <em>wanted</em> to die. I wanted to <em>fucking</em> die,\" he bangs his fist against Death's chest and all he can feel underneath the black cloak are hard, cold bones, \"Why didn't you <em>let</em> me die?\"\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\"Master,\" Death catches Harry\u2019s wrist between his long, skeleton fingers. He asks, \"are you not happy?\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\"Happy?!\" Harry screeches, frustrated beyond comparison. He tries to rip his hand away from Death's cold grip, but to no avail. \"About what? <em>This</em>? This fucking world?\" There are tears gathering at the corners of his eyes, but Harry doesn't feel sadness, he feels betrayal and anger. It doesn't matter if he's friends with Ron and Hermione again, it doesn't matter that he has allies in Slytherin now, it doesn't matter if Sirius is alive, nor does it matter that Voldermort is as close to being sane as he ever will be. Nothing matters when everything is <em>different</em>. So, so different.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">'<em>And yet,'</em> a tiny, traitorous part of Harry's brain whispers, <em>'it is better.'</em>\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\"I was so close,\" Harry's voice is raw with desperation as tears trail down his red cheeks. Underneath his shoes, the grass around him starts to turn brown. \"<em>So close,</em> all you had to do was let me die and it would be over. The <em>pain</em> would be over.\"\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><em>All you had to do was let me die and it would be over. The pain would be over.</em> Death pulls Harry into an embrace, mindful of his body, and casts a heating spell around them. \"It's alright,\" Death murmurs, holding Harry carefully, like one might hold a newborn baby. He stares at the dying grass beneath them and thinks, '<em>truly, you are mine as I am yours.'\u00a0</em></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\"Hate me,\" Death soothes a hand over Harry's back to lessen his trembling and his fighting, \"scream and punish me, but I will never hurt you, Master. Never.\"\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\"You'll just disobey me,'' Harry's words are hoarse and muffled against Death's chest, his knuckles pale from clutching at black robes in sheer desperation, \"and it'll hurt more, just like now, just like always.\"\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The truth, as Death has learned many, many times, is always more spiteful and hurtful than a comforting lie, still, Death would have preferred it, now more than ever.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Fixing their relationship will take time, Death knows this, yet he can't help but feel possessive when he holds his little master between his arms and murmurs him comforting words and promises that he will fulfill without a second thought.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">When exhaustion hits Harry, Death lifts him up into his arms and carries him through the forest, his Master's head lays beneath his jaw, tucked into his neck, warm. <em>\"Is Master alright?\" </em>Verde asks, voice on edge. The snake knows he would not win in a fight and yet he looks ready for revenge.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Death takes a moment to answer. \"He will be, eventually.\"</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\"<em>Eventually</em>,\" Nimmy echoes, unsatisfied with the answer. <em>\"No matter,\" </em>she says, <em>\"we'll </em><em>help</em><em> Master all the same.\" </em></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Death would not expect any less from them.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">1176 words//unedited.\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n<b>Chapter Twenty-Nine:</b>\n</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Harry has never liked the ocean.\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Sure, it <em>looks</em> pretty and there are certain likeable aspects to it, but Harry doesn't see the appeal as much as others do.\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Perhaps it's because others use the ocean as a means to escape, to cool themselves down on a hot summer's day or to feel the simple joys of swimming and diving down to discover small treasures hidden beneath the sands.\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Harry, who has never ever been normal, uses the ocean as a means to <em>forget</em>.\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">He sends his memories to the ocean, has them swim across the shore, merge with the waves and disappear. It's easier this way \u2013 easier to forget why he doesn't like swimming anymore, why tomato soup sits in his mouth like poison or why the thought of betrayal travels down his throat like ash and burns at his insides like acid.\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">It's easier if the world around him blurs and becomes bleak, if he just forgets <em>everything</em>.\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">(Maybe then the feeling of emptiness will be forgotten too.)</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">So, Harry swims across the shore himself. He doesn't even bother to battle with the waves and it's only a matter of seconds before they swallow him up, only for the ocean to devour him next.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">(Still, the hollowness in his being persists.)\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">(Harry knows only one way to deal with a feeling like this.)</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">(He wonders if anyone will forget him.)\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Harry doesn't notice, but the world around him continues, day after day, week after week and month after month.\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Eventually, April turns to May.\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">May turns to June.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">And June turns to July.\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\"--arry! Harry! Are you even listening?\"\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\"Hm?\" Harry blinks, his vision clearing up to show an exasperated Hermione sat across from him at the Library. Everything feels right and distorted at the same time. Harry clears his throat, \"Sorry, I was thinking for a second there. Did you say something?\"</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Hermione sighs, rubbing her forehead with the tips of her fingers. Her nails are weirdly greenish. \"I was asking about your summer plans.\" The girl explains. \"I'm going to Paris with my parents, but since I've been invited to the Malfoy's Ball, I'll floo in for a couple of days. Will you be attending?\"\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\"Right,\" Harry pauses, frowning slightly. \"I'll be staying with my relatives,\" he lies smoothly, peering down at the parchment laid out on the table in front of him. There are a few scribbled notes on Transfiguration and what Harry thinks might be drawings of various ingredients for Potions. \"It'll depend on what they're planning this year,\" Harry says, picking up the parchment for closer inspection, \"so I'm not sure if I'll be allowed to attend the ball.\"\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">His frown deepens when he finds dates jotted on the side, numbers overlapping and jumbled all together. Weird, he thinks, seeing one all the way from Easter. Harry rolls the parchment up, much like Hermione is doing to hers, and places it inside his bag.\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\"That's alright. I'm just glad the exams are over,\" Hermione says, stretching her arms above her head. There's a small crack from her bones and Harry twitches.\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\"Now all I have to stress about are the results,\" Hermione mutters, placing her chin into the palm of her hand.\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\"Yeah,\" Harry says, agreeing, feeling as if someone else is in control of his body. His mouth moves without his consent. \"I'm sure we both did great, 'Mione. Especially considering you made me study with you this whole time.\"</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Hermione laughs. \"Yeah, I know. But <em>still</em>.\"\u00a0The girl stands to her feet, \"right, it's getting late. We should return to our dorms.''</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Nodding, Harry follows the Ravenclaw out of the library and into the halls of Hogwarts. There are a few other students, mostly the upper years, that are still out and about, laughing quietly in corners and talking excitedly in hushed tones. Harry quirks a brow at a pair of Hufflepuffs who walk over to them with trays full of warm snacks.\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Hermione picks out a potato scone with a shy smile and a small, \"Thank you.\"\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Harry indulges in a sausage roll. It's <em>warm</em> and melts inside his mouth. Harry doesn't remember being hungry, but his stomach is suddenly begging for more. He murmurs his thanks to the Hufflepuffs and watches as they disappear around the corner, on their way to offer snacks to other students.\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\"I can't wait to be in their position,'' Hermione murmurs dreamily, \"a seventh year, with the best grades and the best job\u2013\"\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\"You actually want to graduate?\" Harry quips. \"I thought you'd be staying at Hogwarts, for like, forever.\"\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Hermione flushes a deep red. \"Ha ha,\" she scrunches up her nose, evidently already at her limit with being nice today, and waves at him, \"I'll see you tomorrow. Goodnight, Harry,\" she says, moving to ascend the stairs.\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Harry absentmindedly waves back.\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">He doesn't know how he makes it back to his dorm, or how he even falls asleep. When he opens his eyes next, it's to the feeling of dread pooling into every crevice of his body.\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">He stews in the feeling, letting it slowly enter the ocean until it disappears all together, until it becomes nothing \u2013 until Harry becomes <em>nothing</em>.\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">He closes his eyes, counts to five, and when he flutters them open he's sitting in the great hall with a half eaten plate of scrambled eggs. From his side, he hears Pansy and Draco arguing about some of the questions from the Charms exam.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Harry blinks and he's in the Slytherin common room, sitting around the fireplace with the other first years and opening his exam results. He stares down at the parchment, all E's and A's.\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">He should be feeling relief and contentment, but all Harry feels is a numbing coldness. He glances at the fireplace in confusion.\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Blink.\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Harry places the last of his belongings in his truck and then secures the latch.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Blink.\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Harry steps off at Kings Cross, stumbling through the crowd of students running to their parents in excitement. There are yells of joy accompanied by soft smiles and ringing laughter.\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Blink.\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Harry stares up at Grimmauld Place with a sense of guilt clouding his mind. Harry breathes in the ocean like he would breathe in the air around him. It fills up his lungs and suffocates him.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">It takes a few minutes, but the guilt resides and turns into nothingness.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">(It's forgotten.)</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">(Would anyone forget him?)</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><em>Blink</em>.\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Sirius wraps his arms tightly around Harry, \"my little pup, what's the matter?\" He asks, murmuring the words into the youngers messy hair.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\"<em>Cold</em>,\" Harry answers, latching onto the older man. He's warm. Harry needs <em>warmth</em>. \"So <em>cold</em>.\"</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Sirius frowns. \"Let's get you to bed,\" he says.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><em>Blink</em>.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n<b>Chapter Thirty:\u00a0</b>\n</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Harry gets better, eventually. He forgets about the ocean (much like he forgets about everything else that upsets him) and spends his holidays lazing around grimmauld place. He sleeps in the oddest of places, too. Like the space behind the loveseat in the parlour room, the corner chair in the library and once even on the dining table.\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">At one point, Sirius just looks at him over the rim of his cuppa and says, \"Harry, I love you, but with the hair changing, courting thing with Voldymorts and now your transformation into a cat\u2026\" he trails off and sighs, \"I think I'm going to have a stroke if you add another insane oddity into your arsenal.\"\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Harry rolls his eyes. \"I'm not changing into a cat,\" he says, \"and neither is there <em>any</em> courting going on.\"\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\"Again,\" Sirius sets his cup of tea down, \"I love you, prongslet, but Godric, are you <em>delusional</em>.\"\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Harry isn't delusional, thank you very much. He says the very same thing to his familiars that night and all three of them \u2013 Nimmy, Verde and Hedwig \u2013 can't seem to make eye contact with him at all.\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Which is <em>odd</em>, because Harry's not delusional. Sure, he forgets things and sometimes says things that don't make sense and make him seem insane, but he's <em>not</em> delusional.\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Just to be sure, Harry scribbles a letter to Hermione, a simple<em>, 'am I delusional?'</em> and sends Hedwig off with it.\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">When morning comes, Harry's awoken by Hedwig dropping off a return letter beside his head on the pillow. He rubs his eyes tiredly with the back of his hands and rips through the seal of the parchment. Inside, in Hermione's neat handwriting, is written, '<em>if this is about the courting, then yes. If it's about anything else, I'll be needing details to be sure.'\u00a0</em></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">There's a picture attached and Harry smiles softly, seeing Hermione enjoying Paris. '<em>Hope to see you soon,'</em> is written above it and Harry feels warmth flood his chest.\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\"Maybe,\" Harry murmurs to himself, \"if I can get myself to go outside.\"\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Placing the letter and picture onto his bedside table, Harry goes through his morning routine. He takes a hot shower \u2013 hot enough that his skin turns red; he wants to get used to the burn in case he ends up in hell. Which, if he thinks about it, is quite possible. (Death be damned if he gets in his way of dying. <em>Again.</em>)\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">He brushes his teeth and manages to get his hair as presentable as possible, which is an olympic sport at this rate. Harry's worried his hair will <em>never</em> be tamed. He manages to dress himself into a hoodie and some dark jeans and calls it a day. It's not like he's going outside, there's no need to dress himself up nicely.\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">When he's downstairs in the kitchen, he starts on breakfast. Once, he'd woken up to the smell of eggs burning and when he'd gone down to check, he found Sirius frowning down at charred eggs. Ever since then, Harry's made it his mission to make breakfast everyday, just so that he never, ever has to eat anything that Sirius makes.\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\"Morning, pup,\" Sirius greets, slinking up behind Harry to cage him against the counter. His voice is low and gravelly and it sends tingles running up and down Harry's spine.\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\"Morning, Siri,\" he says, quietly.\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Sirius hums and drops a kiss into Harry's messy hair. \"M'hungry,\" the older male murmurs, \"What's for breakfast?\"\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Harry takes a moment to answer. He's warm and gooey and his cheeks are undoubtedly flushed. \"Just some pancakes.\"\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Sirius hums, pleased. He ducks his head down to nuzzle into the space between Harry\u2019s neck and shoulder, mumbling a soft, \"you smell nice,\" before he moves to sit at the table.\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\"Thanks,\" Harry sounds as awkward as ever, \"I showered.\"\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Sirius snorts and sips at his already prepared morning tea.\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><em>\"As smooth as ever, Master,\"</em> Nimmy says, slithering out from underneath the fruits in the basket on the table. <em>\"You're truly eloquent these days.\"\u00a0</em></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><em>\"Yeah,\"</em> Verde agrees from where he's lazing near Sirius's cup of tea, \"<em>whatever eloquent means.\"</em>\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Nimmy sighs<em>. \"Of all the siblings I could have gotten,\"</em> she mutters, pained.\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><em>\"Hey!\"</em> Verde whines, raising his little head towards Harry's direction<em>, \"I'm amazing! Isn't that right, Master?\"\u00a0</em></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Harry pretends not to hear the green and black snake, lest he gets dragged into another one of his familiars very long and very, very tiresome arguments.\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Instead, he places two pancakes onto a plate, sivs some powdered sugar over them and sets the plate in front of Sirius. \"Hope it's not too sweet for you,\" Harry says, shrugging a little.\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Sirius licks over his lips and grins softly. \"I like sweet things.\"\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Harry ignores him too.\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">He prepares a plate of pancakes for himself, these ones drizzled in honey and takes a seat beside Sirius. The two eat in relative silence, occasionally interrupted by the snake siblings hissing profanities at each other.\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><em>\"Maybe you're carrying a disease,\" </em>Verde hisses. <em>\"A disease that makes you say long words that </em><em>don't</em> <em>make</em><em> sense.\" </em></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><em>\"Excuse me?\" </em>Nimmy tackles her brother and they fall off the table and onto the floor with a loud thump. <em>\"You once ate a rotten mouse, if </em><em>anyone's</em><em> carrying a disease its clearly you!\" </em></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><em>Verde snorts. \"Only a disease ridden snake would say </em><em>something</em> <em>like</em><em> that-\"</em></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><em>\"Are you even listening to </em><em>what</em> <em>you're</em><em> saying?\" </em></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><em>\"Facts. </em> <em>I'm</em> <em> saying facts, dear sister.\" </em></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Later, when Sirius heads off to his usual death eater activities, and Harry has made sure his snakes haven't killed each other, he goes back upstairs to his bedroom. He flops down onto his bed and cocoons himself into the duvet.\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Grimmauld place is quiet now. His familiars are no longer arguing and Sirius isn't swearing from some corner of the house, annoyed at one thing or another.\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Others would call it peaceful.\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">But Harry knows better.\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">It's moments like these that make Harry <em>remember</em>. The quietness brings out memories that Harry has long since buried and he twists in his duvet, shoves his face into his pillow and screams until his voice turns hoarse. He <em>doesn't</em> want to remember. Memories of his old life should <em>stay</em> buried forever. They don't belong to him now. They're not relevant anymore. But still, it hurts and it burns and it makes his <em>ache</em>.\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">He'll end it soon, Harry is sure of it. He can't continue on like this, pretending to be something he isn't. He's just <em>so</em> tired and he wants everything to <em>stop</em>.\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">What's the point in living if Harry doesn't see a future for himself? He's surprised he's even made it this far.\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><em>Soon</em>, Harry promises himself, lifting his face to gaze at the necklace he made from the philosopher's stone set on his bedside table. <em>Soon</em>.\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n<em>THE END. </em>\n</p>\n<p>Hello everyone!\u00a0</p>\n<p>I will no longer be continuing this book.
