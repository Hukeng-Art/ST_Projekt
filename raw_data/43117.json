  "text": "<p>The Lady Angora was stroking her dinner fork as she went on and on about how lovely Camelot was in spring, and Arthur was at a juncture so desperate that he fleetingly contemplated impaling himself on said fork. The feast to celebrate yet another treaty with yet another kingdom that Arthur was having a difficult time remembering the name of was dwindling down. The candles lighting the banquet hall were stuttering sleepily in their brackets. His father was discussing some serious matter in the corner of the room, his earlier joviality gone for the evening. Arthur had sent Merlin away at least an hour ago, intending on following him right away, but Lady Angora had slipped into the seat next to him and good grief, did she know his number. It would be rude to excuse himself from a conversation with a royal guest.</p>\n<p>He would usually resolve these situations by yawning loudly to hint that it was getting late, but after several polite yawns and then one extremely large yawn that strained his mouth, she was still going on and on, convinced that he was as enamored with her as she was with him. He couldn\u2019t even be entirely angry with her, because he <em>had</em> been interested in her until about an hour ago, right until this wretched conversation. He had talked with her most of the evening; one would imagine that this was good enough for any woman. But now it was late and Merlin had probably wandered off to his own rooms and Arthur hadn\u2019t gotten the chance to properly make fun of that silly hat all evening and now he would have to put himself to bed and bathe in tepid water. It was time for drastic measures.</p>\n<p>Arthur was used to lying to women. It was an unsavory trait, granted, but it was also a survival tactic. Every noblewoman eligible for betrothal had tried their very best to seduce Arthur ever since he was old enough to know what sex was (and even younger than that, dear <em>god</em>.) To avoid their attentions and escape unscathed, Arthur had come up with many lies that were not wholly lies. Arthur had learned long ago from his father that the best lies were the ones that held half truths. He therefore hatched an escape plan.</p>\n<p>\u201cLady Angora, it pleases me that you enjoy Camelot,\u201d he began, and he <em>was </em>pleased; Camelot was his heart. Lady Angora beamed, most likely picturing herself as queen of the castle at that very moment. He was sure that most noblewomen, despite what Morgana said, had their very own Camelot castle doll houses and had dreamt of marrying him since they were still wearing pigtails. \u201cIf you would like, we could perhaps go early tomorrow and I can take you on a tour of the immediate countryside.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat would be most gracious of you, Sire. We must turn in early, then.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cQuite right,\u201d Arthur agreed, slyly kissing her hand as he rose from the table. Tomorrow morning he had training with two new knights and his father had only informed him a few hours ago. He would simply go to practice and then apologize to her that afternoon, when she was scheduled to leave. After all, training was one of his royal duties and nothing comes before that. Or at least, not traditionally, but she did not need to know that detail.</p>\n<p>When he arrived at his chamber, Merlin was still there, having fallen asleep in a chair by the fire. By the time he woke Merlin, teased him about the hat, talked him out of destroying the hat as he held it threateningly over the fireplace, and then bullied Merlin into fetching him more firewood, Arthur was entirely pleased with his brilliance and how lovely his life was at the moment.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>The next day he went to training and had a roaring good time with his fellow knights. It was less practice than it was a chance to share sordid stories about last night\u2019s banquet and when Arthur came across Lady Angora in the hall afterwards, he was still in a jovial mood and was fully planning on speaking to her good naturedly about her next visit. He slowed his steps, however, when he saw that she wore a stony expression. Oh right, he lied about this morning.</p>\n<p>\u201cI am terribly sorry, my lady. My father sprung practice on the knights at an early hour this morning.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lady Angora, unnervingly, said not a word. Instead, she shook her head slightly, like she felt <em>sorry</em> for him, turned around, and left. Well, if she was going to get in a tizzy about this, that was her right and not his problem.</p>\n<p>He was a bit chagrined to find out that his father had invited his guests to stay for a few more days, but at least he knew that even if he <em>had </em>been rude, he at least wasn\u2019t going to have to endure any more lengthy conversations from Lady Angora. He was cheered by this thought all through supper and into the evening. Merlin was late coming to his bedchambers, but Arthur was in so good a mood that all he said was a derisive, \u201cMust be nice to have a job where you can come and go as you please, I\u2019m sure all the servants in the castle do <em>their</em> jobs whenever they like\u201d and began sharing some of the sordid stories that the knights had told him this morning, enjoying the way the tips of Merlin\u2019s ears would redden.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhen should I come back in the morning?\u201d Merlin asked as Arthur pulled back his bedcovers to lie down for the night.</p>\n<p>\u201cAt first light,\u201d Arthur answered.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy must I <em>always</em> be here so early in the morning?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBecause you make rising at an ungodly hour more bearable,\u201d Arthur said without thinking. Merlin smiled in an insidiously happy way, and Arthur scowled because Merlin clearly had misunderstood him and he needed to qualify. \u201cThough you are a pitiful servant and I certainly could do better for myself.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCould you?\u201d Merlin asked, sort of sarcastically but still with that dead chuffed smile.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo.\u201d Arthur was taken aback, fairly sure that he hadn\u2019t meant to say that. He must be more tired than he thought.</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you all right, sire?\u201d Merlin asked, eyes narrowing in worried consideration.</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he answered, shakily. Merlin checked his forehead for fever and went to secure him a glass of water for the night. He only fell asleep when Merlin finished quietly doing his chores and snuffed out the candles.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>When he woke the next morning, Merlin had breakfast set out for him. Arthur was so surprised and pleased that his servant was actually punctual and efficient that he only bickered a little as Merlin force-fed him a vial of a brackish liquid, care of Gaius.</p>\n<p>\u201cShall I muck out your stables today, my Lord?\u201d Merlin asked, not sounding pleased at all with the thought of doing it. Arthur smiled, fully intending to string Merlin along for a while with the notion that Merlin was to clean <em>all</em> the royal stables.</p>\n<p>Instead, he said, \u201cNo. You end up smelling like them and then I don\u2019t see you all day.\u201d His mouth instantly halted its smiling and instead simply fell open, just as much at a loss on what to do as its owner was. Merlin, for his part, was perplexed.</p>\n<p>\u201cI thought that not seeing me would be a plus.\u201d</p>\n<p>Arthur rallied himself, even if he felt like panicking. \u201cIt depends on my mood. In fact, it would be highly neglectful of me to forgo my stables, especially with honored guests present. You should go muck those out, but first you need to do my laundry, polish my armor, walk my dogs, and scrub the floors.\u201d</p>\n<p>Merlin\u2019s confusion was replaced with thinly veiled anger and, naturally, he banged insolently out of the room. Arthur felt a bit better.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>The day only got stranger. For some reason he kept letting things slip, like when Gwen had asked him if he was all right at supper. He had told her that he was annoyed that the cooks didn\u2019t bother to peel the potatoes before mashing them. It wasn\u2019t an overtly huge disclosure, but it was not something he would normally just speak of to a servant lest it got around to the cook and Arthur\u2019s food was spat in or worse.</p>\n<p>He avoided Morgana like the plague, because whatever was going on with him today, he certainly didn\u2019t want her sticking her nose into his business. He narrowly missed running into Gaius, who would probably sniff out discord in Arthur\u2019s behavior in a matter of seconds. The last thing he needed was that <em>eyebrow</em>, stretched looming and condescending down at Arthur, inexplicably so, since Arthur has been taller than Gaius for years now. </p>\n<p>When Arthur arrived safely in his room for lunch, Merlin was on his hands and knees, scrubbing the floor, his trousers soaked because he most likely had spilled soapy water all over himself. Arthur sat and slurped at the fresh stew, enjoying a rush of dark pleasure as he watched Merlin laboring and ignoring Arthur for all he was worth.</p>\n<p>Until a servant arrived and informed him that the king wished to see him immediately. Arthur pulled Merlin up and ordered him to go as well.</p>\n<p>\u201cBut it\u2019s going to take me forever to finish everything as it is! Why do you need me to come?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBecause I sure as hell don\u2019t want to face my father alone today,\u201d he blurted out angrily. His mouth snapped shut and he could feel all the blood drain from his face. Merlin almost looked <em>scared</em>.</p>\n<p>\u201cSire, I\u2019m sure if you sent a servant to the king and told him you were unwell\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI am perfectly fine and I\u2019m <em>not unwell</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cArthur, you wouldn\u2019t back down from facing an <em>undead knight</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not intending to <em>back down. </em>Just because I don\u2019t wish to see someone doesn\u2019t mean that I <em>won\u2019t.</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>He pulled on his dirtiest pair of boots and made sure to leave dirt clods over the parts of the floor Merlin had just cleaned before leaving.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>His father was in a fine mood.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou do realise that we have important guests in this castle.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course.\"</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd that one of them is a marriage prospect.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIf you are referring to the Lady Angora, we have spent time together.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe Lady Angora and Lord Fabrian of Earsinys are potential allies for Camelot. A marriage between you and the Lady Angora would ensure a victory over Mercia, who are still bitter over their apparent ill treatment the last time they tried to make an alliance with Camelot.\u201d</p>\n<p>Arthur remembered. He supposed being invited as a guest of peace in a foreign kingdom and then mistakenly having all of your party thrown into the dungeons for a couple of days would make one quite bitter. But Arthur could hardly give a damn about all that. Bayard was still a boring louse, and Arthur still suspected that he had been in alliance with the sorceress who poisoned Merlin.</p>\n<p>\u201cI am aware as to my duty, Father.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThen why have I heard talk of Lady Angora shutting herself in her room and not wishing to speak to anyone?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMost likely because I lied to her, and now she\u2019s in a right temper,\u201d Arthur responded, crossing his arms defiantly. Uther\u2019s eyes narrowed.</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you not think of your duty to this kingdom?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAlways.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThen why do you insist on treating our guests with such ill respect if your aim is to better your kingdom?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBecause I am tired of being treating like a prize cow.\u201d Arthur bit his lip, horrified that this had come out. Uther glowered at his son, having gone quiet and dangerous, a stern lecture imminent.</p>\n<p>\u201cSire,\u201d Merlin butted in, and Arthur wanted to strangle the idiot because <em>didn\u2019t he ever learn</em>? \u201cArthur\u2019s not feeling well, I think he needs to lie down for a bit\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHow dare you tell <em>me</em> what my son<em> </em>needs? Guards.\u201d Two guards materialized and grabbed Merlin\u2019s arms. Arthur\u2019s mind worked fast.</p>\n<p>\u201cFather, we have a food shortage, surely the stocks are a little too much.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re right. Send him to the dungeons.\u201d The guards whisked Merlin away, the tall wooden doors shutting with finality behind them. \u201cAnd <em>you</em>,\u201d he said, pointing a gloved finger at Arthur. \u201cWill attend to your duties and apologize to Lady Angora.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll apologize, but let me handle my own servant.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI can see how well your handling has worked thus far. You\u2019re too soft on the boy.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not <em>soft</em> on anything,\u201d Arthur said, indignant.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019ll only be in there overnight, and you can have other servants pick up the slack. Why get in an upset over it?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBecause I hate the way you speak to him.\u201d</p>\n<p>And as his father turned various shades of red and purple, Arthur knew that he was well and truly cursed.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>The depressing upshot of it all was that his father now believed <em>Arthur</em> to have a mental affliction, thus Merlin was released because he at least had told the king the truth about Arthur needing a lie down. Arthur vindictively sent Merlin to muck out the stables, <em>handling</em> his servant properly, and then sequestered himself in his room with orders to all servants not to intrude on his privacy. Of course, this peace lasted only an hour, broken by Morgana slamming into his room, face drawn and furious like a cat who had just clawed its way out of a bathtub after being thrown in.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou are a silly little boy with absolutely no heart,\u201d she greeted, gripping the edges of his table and leveling a glare at where he was seated.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat have I done <em>this</em> time?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGwen and I arrived just after dark after a lovely day in the orchard,\u201d Morgana said, as if she was telling Arthur a wonderful fairy tale she had just heard. Then she bit out, \u201cImagine our surprise when we encountered Merlin in the stables, cleaning them <em>in the dark</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s nice to know that he\u2019s following orders for once.\u201d</p>\n<p>Morgana looked murderous. He was glad that he hadn\u2019t ordered dinner yet, because surely there would have been a knife in her clutches at this point. \u201cThen I talked with him and it turns out that not only are you making him muck out your stables at night, but that you got him thrown in the dungeons earlier today.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe got <em>himself</em> thrown in the dungeons. Besides, he was only there for about half an hour.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHalf an hour in which he was jailed with four prostitutes and three thieves, one of which tried to convince him to hide some stolen jewelry in his pants because the guards would likely not search the servant of the prince.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIf it\u2019s any consolation, I\u2019m sure he knew that the palace guards have no problem rustling around in his privates for stolen goods,\u201d he assured her, standing up to avoid being talked down to like a child and drinking from his goblet.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd <em>speaking of privates</em>, he was also molested by one of the prostitutes.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe should all be so lucky, and for free, even.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShe was fifty and had a moustache!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, no such thing as a free lunch, then.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou are a sniveling brat who wouldn\u2019t just attend to his own health and have a lie down. Future king indeed. Can\u2019t even stand on his own, doing whatever his daddy commands.\u201d</p>\n<p>Arthur bristled, his fingers nearly turning white from the tight grip he had on his goblet. \u201cIt was <em>me</em> who managed to get Merlin out of the dungeons with a slap on the wrist and it was <em>Merlin</em> who couldn\u2019t stand there and shut up in front of the king.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe stood up for you!\u201d she all but bellowed. \u201cThe least you could do was stand up for <em>him</em>. Do you not think of him at all?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI think about him all the time!\u201d he shouted, slamming his goblet back onto the table. Morgana was shocked into silence and Arthur winced, realising how that had just sounded. He ground his teeth and turned toward the window. \u201cI told my father that I didn\u2019t like how he treated Merlin. There, are you satisfied? Want to run off and talk more with Merlin behind my back and then come back and cast more aspersions on my character?\u201d</p>\n<p>He waited a while, expecting her to start yelling again or worse, speak softly to him, but when he turned around to face her, she had left.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Merlin appeared some time later, smelling to high heavens and looking as if he too wanted to murder Arthur. Arthur stopped him from gathering the unfinished laundry and told him to sit despite this. Merlin did so, angry and wary.</p>\n<p>\u201cSomething\u2019s wrong with me,\u201d Arthur began, staring at the fire and trying not to pace as he had been doing since Morgana left.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve been telling you that since I met you,\u201d Merlin quipped, set on being insufferable all evening.</p>\n<p>\u201cI mean, something is not right. I think I\u2019m cursed.\u201d</p>\n<p>Merlin\u2019s anger and resentment took a backseat to reluctant concern. \u201cCursed how?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t really know. I just keep\u2026telling the truth,\u201d he admitted.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou have to tell the truth?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNot all the time. I can still lie, but sometimes\u2026I tell the truth.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cRight. That makes very little sense, Arthur,\u201d Merlin said, though he sounded as if he was still willing to be convinced.</p>\n<p>\u201cThings just keep slipping out, I don\u2019t know how it works.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cRight, tell me a lie. Something obvious.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAll right. I\u2019m a girl.\u201d</p>\n<p>Merlin raised both eyebrows in astonishment. \u201cYou really <em>are</em> telling the truth.\u201d</p>\n<p>Arthur glared at him.</p>\n<p>Merlin smirked and said, \u201cYou walked right into that one, mate.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShall I <em>prove</em> that I\u2019m not a girl?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIf you feel that insecure, then by all means.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLet\u2019s try another lie. I am not the prince of Camelot.\u201d</p>\n<p>Merlin nodded. \u201cDefinitely a lie, since the gods know that you\u2019re a spoiled elitist brat.\u201d</p>\n<p>Arthur gave Merlin a dangerous look. \u201cYou\u2019re being extra insubordinate tonight.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI think my manners got lost somewhere in all that horse shit I waded in the past hour. Anyway, so you can lie. I don\u2019t see the cause for concern.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI told you, sometimes I tell the truth.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMaybe you have a mental affliction,\u201d Merlin suggested, loftily.</p>\n<p>\u201cFirst you call me a spoiled brat and now you\u2019re insinuating that I am insane. Why did I convince my father that keeping you in prison wasn\u2019t a wonderful idea?\u201d</p>\n<p>Merlin fidgeted a little, turning serious. \u201cI don\u2019t know. Why did you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t deserve it.\u201d Arthur\u2019s eyes widened in realisation. \u201cI tell the truth when I\u2019m asked a question.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh.\u201d Merlin said.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cVery sure.\u201d</p>\n<p>Merlin smiled slowly and terrifyingly and Arthur remembered that Merlin was presumably still vexed with him. \u201cWhat were you really doing last week when you told me that you were on patrol?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI was lazing about in a meadow. Damn it, Merlin!\u201d Merlin had the completely suicidal gall to laugh in his face. \u201cNo more questions from you!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHave you ever worn women\u2019s clothes?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes.\u201d Arthur felt his face heat up and Merlin looked ready to burst a blood vessel from laughing at the crown prince of Camelot. \u201cI was eight and it was all Morgana\u2019s fault!\u201d</p>\n<p>Merlin eventually subsided into quiet choking giggles the longer Arthur glared at him. \u201cI think this is the best thing that\u2019s ever happened to me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou will ask no more questions.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh come on, I\u2019m sure it can\u2019t get any worse than admitting to wearing women\u2019s clothes,\u201d Merlin said, positively giddy. Arthur let some of his discomfort show on his face.</p>\n<p>\u201cHow would you feel if you were unable to lie? If every secret you had was in danger of being said aloud?\u201d</p>\n<p>The laughter was gone from Merlin\u2019s face and Arthur could see that the seriousness of his situation had hit home. Arthur briefly wondered what dark secrets <em>Merlin</em> could possibly hold, amusing himself with the imagined scenario of Merlin confessing that he got a rise out of being put in the stocks.</p>\n<p>\u201cSorry. No more questions, sire.\u201d Arthur nodded in satisfaction, remembering for a second why he never had the heart to truly sack Merlin. \u201cWe have to see Gaius, he may be able to help.\u201d</p>\n<p>Arthur nodded and retrieved his coat.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>\u201cThis is no doubt a result of sorcery,\u201d Gaius told them solemnly after they told him the problem. Arthur fought the desire to roll his eyes. Of course it was bloody sorcery.</p>\n<p>\u201cCan anything be done about it?\u201d Arthur asked, glossing over this obvious fact.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid that this particular kind of sorcery is a spell of vengeance and only the person who cast it can tell you how to end it. There is an old tale of a counselor of a great kingdom who had this spell placed on him, forcing him to reveal all the secrets of the kingdom. Whoever ensorcelled you may be a traitor or perhaps our guests are not here for strictly diplomatic reasons.\u201d</p>\n<p>Arthur\u2019s attention pricked at that one and then he felt like an even bigger idiot than Merlin when he figured it out.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe Lady Angora gave me a funny look the other day.\u201d</p>\n<p>Gaius looked doubtful. \u201cThat\u2019s not strictly against the law, sire.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut she shook her head at me because I had lied to get out of spending time with her.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201dI always knew the prat in you would get into this kind of trouble,\u201d Merlin piped up, shooting <em>Arthur</em> a look of long suffering. Arthur sometimes wondered if he could possibly get Merlin a manservant who was shit, so that Merlin could appreciate how wonderful Arthur was for not sacking him at the end of each day.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t a complete lie. I <em>did</em> have to train two knights that morning.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI can bet good money that you asked to spend time with her, knowing that you had to train in the morning so that you could get out of seeing her and still be polite.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMerlin, do shut up.\u201d</p>\n<p>Merlin subsided with a knowing grin and a shake of his head.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe fact remains that this is probably her form of vengeance.\u201d Gaius said. \u201cPerhaps the king should be informed.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, I\u2019ll remedy this mess,\u201d Arthur said, moving toward the door.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d Merlin asked.</p>\n<p>\u201cLady Angora\u2019s rooms and <em>that was a question</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but I kind of figured that it was a rhetorical question. I\u2019m coming with you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, you will stay here in case she tries anything.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m coming with you!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd how could you possibly help? Wave your arms at her? Fuss her to death?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShe\u2019s a noblewoman and it\u2019s late. If you go by yourself and someone sees you, they\u2019ll tell your father and then you\u2019ll have to tell him the truth.\u201d Arthur grumbled only a little bit before leaving for the guest rooms, Merlin in tow.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Turns out that Arthur didn\u2019t have to suffer the indignity of knocking on her door. They found her gazing out of a window halfway there.</p>\n<p>\u201cLady Angora,\u201d Arthur announced jovially, a hint of steel underlying it.</p>\n<p>\u201cPrince Arthur,\u201d she said equably, turning away from the window and facing them.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe know what you did,\u201d Merlin piped up from behind him, and Arthur forced himself not to roll his eyes. Honestly, it was like a mouse threatening a cat.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou will lift this curse or I will have your head,\u201d Arthur commanded, drawing his sword in one smooth movement.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou are charming, aren\u2019t you Arthur?\u201d she asked.</p>\n<p>\u201cI am extremely charming,\u201d Arthur immediately responded. Merlin made a pained sound and he swore he could hear him mumble, \u201c<em>Of course that would be the honest truth.\u201d</em> Arthur magnanimously chose to ignore him. Lady Angora walked a bit closer, strangely calm for someone who was at the business end of a sword.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis is not a curse, Arthur Pendragon,\u201d she intoned, and what was it with wizards doing that whole \u2018I am a big bad sorcerer so kneel before me\u2019 act? He was certain he could identify a sorcerer based on that alone. \u201cIt is a gift.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, well, you can have the gift back,\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe curse can only be lifted by you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Great. One of <em>those</em> sorcerers. Honestly, it wasn\u2019t like he had been killing any unicorns lately. Perhaps he had inadvertently stepped on a fairie this time.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd I suppose the next thing you\u2019re going to tell me is that I will be tested?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe cure is simple. People lie for many reasons. Those who lie the most have the greatest need to find truths hidden even from themselves.\u201d She took a step closer, chest grazing the tip of Arthur\u2019s held sword. \u201cYou could have just told me the truth, but you felt the need to lie anyway. You are a practised liar and for the curse to lift, you will need to discover what it is that you lie about the most. Even to yourself.\u201d</p>\n<p>Arthur just couldn\u2019t believe how insane sorcerers were. \u201cWhat kind of stupid curse is that? How am I to know what I lie about the most?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat is for you alone to discover.\"</p>\n<p>Arthur narrowed his eyes. \u201cYou aren\u2019t actually related to anyone called Anhora, are you?\u201d</p>\n<p>She shook her head in confusion, and he shouldered more humiliation as he heard Merlin stifle a snigger.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou may as well put the sword down. You won\u2019t kill me, will you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d he hissed, sheathing his sword irritably. Fucking truth spells. \u201cBut rest assured that I won\u2019t hesitate if I find that you escape this castle before the spell is lifted. I would never trust the word of a sorcerer.\u201d</p>\n<p>She raised an eyebrow, and he wondered if he shouldn\u2019t just have her executed out of spite. \u201cYou\u2019ve got a lot to think about. I\u2019ll retire for the night.\u201d</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>When Arthur returned to his chambers, he placed his hands on either end of the fireplace and leaned against it.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis might not be too difficult,\u201d Merlin said lightly, and Arthur heard the clatter of Merlin collecting his dishes.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat are you blithering on about?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, you have to tell the truth. All you have to do is have someone ask you what your biggest lie is.\u201d</p>\n<p>Arthur raised his head a little, grudgingly impressed. Merlin, when not being a complete idiot, was sometimes quite clever. Not that he\u2019d tell Merlin that unless he was about to drink poison and die.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe only problem is, I have to be asked.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2026right,\u201d Merlin drawled, like Arthur really did have a mental affliction.</p>\n<p>Arthur matched his tone. \u201cMeaning that whoever asks will know my greatest lie. Think of the hold they would have over me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Merlin twigged on, frowning deeply. \u201cWell, who do you trust? There\u2019s Morgana, you\u2019ve known each other forever.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd give that brazen hussy possibly asinine information with which to torment me?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, Gwen would keep your secret,\u201d Merlin next suggested. Arthur hesitated on that one, because while it was true that Guinevere would keep his secret, he felt highly uncomfortable with the idea of it. Guinevere represented the people of Camelot, and he couldn\u2019t stomach the possibility of disappointing his people.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said.</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay then, Gaius. He\u2019s a physician, he\u2019s sworn to secrecy and the king trusts him.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMerlin, just ask me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMe?\u201d Merlin asked, sounding shocked.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes. As my manservant, you have to keep my confidences. In addition, you <em>have</em> proven to be loyal.\u201d He didn\u2019t say, <em>I trust you</em>. Merlin seemed to hear it anyway, and was looking at Arthur with a decidedly soppy expression that Arthur wanted gone this instant. \u201cAsk and get it over with.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAll right,\u201d Merlin said walking over to Arthur and standing in front of him, a serious look on his face. \u201cArthur, what is your biggest secret?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Arthur scowled. \u201cI suppose it\u2019s not as simple as it looks.\u201d</p>\n<p>Five days passed with no change in Arthur\u2019s condition. Arthur managed to shirk most of his duties by a stroke of luck. To keep Lady Angora close by in case he really did have to execute her, he had formally requested that the guests stay longer, pleasing his father to no end. No doubt his father and Lord Whatever-His-Name-Was were too busy drawing up marriage contracts to really pay that much attention to what Arthur was really doing.</p>\n<p>Currently, Arthur was lying prone on his bed, a cool rag against his forehead to ease the headache there. He had never thought so much in such a short span of time. Arthur had never, in fact, been much of a thinker. He preferred action, the kind of action seen in battle, no time for thoughts. He prized this trait in his knights, the ability to separate the mind and to fight on pure instinct. He had learned over the years the need for thought in diplomacy and grave matters, but he never enjoyed it or relished it.</p>\n<p>Now he was worn, dead tired of going through memories, agitating old wounds, and rifling through deeply repressed thoughts that he carefully pushed to the back of his mind. Like the matter of marriage and how it would feel, being bonded to someone he barely knew, not loving them. He thought of his mother, who he might be today if she had lived. He had even, in his most Herculean effort yet, disassembled his relationship with his father and unfurled years upon years of repressed anger, resentment, humiliation, and shame. After several hours of <em>that</em>, he had called for a meal, hoping that this had been enough. A serving girl came in and asked if there was anything else, and he told her that he wanted to see Merlin instead of telling her nothing else was required. She curtseyed and left, and Arthur fell back onto his bed, cold compress on his forehead, miserable and wondering why the hell he wanted to see Merlin. He had thought about his manservant enough on day two of his seclusion. Then again, putting Merlin in his place was always a wonderful stress reliever and required very little thought. His subconscious was obviously seeking means to repair its fragile state.</p>\n<p>Merlin came in soon after, wearing an old shift that had only dreamed of being white and breeches, most likely having been woken up to come here. His hair was rumpled and he was blinking blearily, movements lethargic.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou wanted to see me?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d Arthur said, taking the rag off his forehead and holding it out. \u201cDip this in that bucket and send someone to the icehouse.\u201d</p>\n<p>Merlin scowled, taking the rag. \u201cArthur, it\u2019s late and it would be unfair to get someone to go all the way to the river in the dark, walk down into the bowels of the icehouse, and gather some ice for your big spoiled head.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI should make you do it,\u201d Arthur responded, groaning as Merlin took the rag and Arthur drug his outstretched hand in to clutch at his pounding skull.</p>\n<p>\u201cCareful,\u201d Merlin warned in amusement, \u201cIn the state you\u2019re in, I just might be able to beat you in a fight.</p>\n<p>Arthur scoffed. \u201cI could have both my arms and legs lobbed off and you\u2019d <em>still</em> be useless in a fight.\u201d</p>\n<p>Merlin hummed noncommittally, obviously too sleepy to bicker too much, and placed the newly cooled rag on Arthur\u2019s forehead. Arthur moaned a little in relief and lay prone on the bed, all the world\u2019s suffering on his shoulders. Merlin began to pull Arthur\u2019s boots off and dug under him to retrieve the bed linens. He watched Merlin pull the covers up and essentially tuck Arthur in with great amusement.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ll find a way out of this,\u201d Merlin said, an earnest promise in his voice. Merlin was leaning over Arthur, the laces undone on his night shift, neck reflecting the light of the fire.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019d better. I have to see my father in the morning. There are matters I need to attend to, even if he fully believes that I am currently dizzy for the Lady Angora.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell you certainly have an addled mind because of her,\u201d Merlin said equably, straightening and moving toward the door. \u201cJust rest tonight, sire. You\u2019ll need it.\u201d</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Arthur had never wanted to be anywhere else so much in his entire life. He\u2019d gladly battle some magical beast than to have to endure his father, who was in a cold rage about something this morning.</p>\n<p>\u201cI have heard from various sources that you have sequestered yourself in your chambers for the past several days and that the Lady Angora has not left hers in that same time.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI thought it would be better if we were seen to be more prudent in our exchanges.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThis from my son, who would have <em>married</em> the Lady Sophia if I had not forbidden it directly.\u201d</p>\n<p>Arthur winced. As if he constantly needed reminding of <em>that</em> debacle<em>. </em>He hardly remembered a thing from it, and he had already spent three hours thinking about it yesterday.</p>\n<p>\u201cTherefore I have chosen a wiser course of action this time around.\u201d</p>\n<p>Uther glared at him. \u201cYou will tell me the meaning behind all of this. Now.\u201d</p>\n<p>Arthur had never in his life been so glad that his father tended to order him around rather than just ask nicely.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt is just as I\u2019ve said. We spend about a half hour a day together to keep modest appearances. I want her to stay longer.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShe will be leaving tomorrow.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFather, you can\u2019t do that,\u201d Arthur said, alarmed.</p>\n<p>Uther leaned threateningly over the main dining table. \u201cIt is clear that you have no active interest in the girl. Why is it so imperative that this girl, who you so clearly are not enamoured with, stay in Camelot?\u201d</p>\n<p>Fuck. \u201cShe\u2019s a sorceress and she has placed a spell on me. She must stay so I can be sure that I\u2019m cured.\u201d</p>\n<p>Uther turned a shade of red the likes of which Camelot itself had never seen. \u201cIf this is the truth, you have been hiding a known practitioner of magic from justice.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not like it\u2019s an evil spell, and I brought some of it upon myself.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat is this spell?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m forced to tell the truth.\u201d Arthur closed his eyes for a couple of seconds, a deep knot of dread filling his chest. His father didn\u2019t say a word to this.</p>\n<p>\u201cGuards, seize the Lady Angora. She is accused of sorcery.\u201d<em></em></p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>Lady Angora was to be burned at dawn. Arthur drank deeply from his goblet, systematically attempting to get as drunk as possible. Merlin was pacing before the fireplace, face stricken.</p>\n<p>\u201cWould you stop <em>pacing</em>?\u201d Arthur bit out, gently massaging his pounding right temple.</p>\n<p>Merlin stopped and turned toward him, resolute. \u201cThis isn\u2019t right.\u201d</p>\n<p>He sighed heavily. \u201cShe\u2019s a sorceress who cast a hex on the crown prince. Her motivations were selfish and petty and could have insurmountable consequences for the kingdom. My father has executed sorcerers for much less.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI know that, but I visited her in the dungeon and she wouldn\u2019t stop crying. She just doesn\u2019t like being lied to. Her father always lies to her about things and when you did it to her, she was understandably upset.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUnderstandably?\u201d Arthur plunked his goblet back on the table, moving around it to face Merlin. \u201cShe cursed me and <em>you\u2019re</em> defending her!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShe never meant for this to happen! She thought that you would have cured yourself in less than day. The spell won\u2019t end with her death.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd how would you know that Merlin? Because <em>she </em>told you?\u201d Merlin went quiet. Arthur nodded, because of course she did and Merlin, the gullible little idiot, had swallowed it all up. \u201cAs I\u2019ve told you before; never trust the word of a sorcerer.\u201d</p>\n<p>Merlin stood still for several seconds, and Arthur watched Merlin\u2019s face harden in resolve. \u201cDo you trust me, Arthur?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d Arthur immediately answered. Then he glared at Merlin for making him answer that.</p>\n<p>\u201cBut you <em>don\u2019t</em> trust the word of a sorcerer?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNever,\u201d he answered, pleased that this was clear, but still glaring at Merlin.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat would you do if <em>I</em> was a sorcerer?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he answered, frowning because that wasn\u2019t right. \u201cThat\u2019s a stupid question because you obviously aren\u2019t one.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut I am.\u201d</p>\n<p>Arthur rolled his eyes. \u201cNot <em>this</em> again. Really, pretending to be a sorcerer to save Gwen is understandable, but one sob story and you\u2019re willing to put your life on the line? I\u2019m fairly sure I can get my father to execute her on a chopping block instead of in a fire\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cArthur, <em>stop</em>.\u201d Arthur startled as Merlin whispered something and his eyes seemed to flash gold, but that couldn\u2019t be right. He startled when he saw that the goblet he had been drinking from earlier was hovering at eye level between them. Arthur stood frozen, disbelieving. Then a rage as he had never known swept through him, and all he could think was <em>liar</em>.</p>\n<p>\u201cI should have you burned right beside her!\u201d he snarled, knocking the goblet out of the air. Merlin\u2019s face instantly filled with so much pain and hurt that Arthur couldn\u2019t look at it, couldn\u2019t handle this.</p>\n<p>\u201cArthur, I\u2019m sorry\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI <em>trusted you</em>, and you took advantage of it. You\u2019ve been lying to me since the day we met. What in all the heavens do you have to say to defend yourself?\u201d</p>\n<p>Arthur wasn\u2019t looking directly at Merlin, but he could see the slump of his shoulders and the edge of his anguished jaw.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou said that you couldn\u2019t trust a sorcerer, but you trust me and I\u2019m a sorcerer.\u201d</p>\n<p>Arthur\u2019s eyes snapped back to Merlin\u2019s face. \u201cAsk me again if I trust you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo. I know you don\u2019t, not now. But I trust <em>you</em>. That\u2019s why I\u2019m telling you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re telling me now to manipulate me, to try to get me to change my mind about the Lady Angora. If you trusted me, you would have told me the truth back in Ealdor, instead of letting Will lie for you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Merlin bristled, as if he had any right to be offended. \u201cMy best friend died and as we burned his body, all you could do was warn me against sorcerers like him. Sure he died saving you, but that only let <em>me</em> get away with hiding a sorcerer from you. I\u2019ve saved your life over and over again, just like Will, and I\u2019m a sorcerer.\u201d</p>\n<p>That angered Arthur at the same time that it broke something he didn\u2019t know he had inside. \u201cObviously you only saved my life because it would save your own hide, then. It makes logical sense why you would do it. If the truth were ever found out about you, I would be indebted to you. That\u2019s it, isn\u2019t it? That first time you saved my life you didn\u2019t even <em>like</em> me. You did it to earn a reward.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s true, I didn\u2019t like you, but I wasn\u2019t going to let you <em>die</em>. I didn\u2019t even know one gave rewards for saving you. You get yourself into so much danger that the most anyone can expect is a fruit basket.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd how many times was it because of magic that my life was in danger?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMagic is neither good nor bad. I don\u2019t use my magic that way.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, so I\u2019m to openly trust that you have never used it to your own advantage? Never once used it to finish chores? I <em>knew</em> my armour was too polished to have been done by a country bumpkin like yourself his first day on the job.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd shiny armour is evil now, is it?\u201d</p>\n<p>Arthur\u2019s jaw tightened, having enough of this. \u201cYou know the penalty for sorcery. Can you give me one good reason, besides saving my life for your own advantage, why I shouldn\u2019t have you executed?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe questing beast,\u201d Merlin said, lowering his eyes.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo you killed it with magic, as I\u2019m sure you did with the griffin as well. If that\u2019s the best you can do\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhen you were bit by the questing beast, you were going to die. There was no cure for it, except one. To save one life, another life must be given to keep the balance of nature. Only a powerful sorcerer could do the trade. I traveled to the Isle of the Blessed and gave my life for yours.\u201d</p>\n<p>Arthur stared. \u201cThat can\u2019t be true. You\u2019re still here, how would you have gotten out of it?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI was tricked. Nimueh tried to take my mother\u2019s life as payment, so I planned to go back and <em>make</em> her take me. Gaius went before me to give his life, and he nearly did. I killed Nimueh.\u201d</p>\n<p>A cold chill ran down Arthur\u2019s spine. \u201c<em>You</em> killed a powerful sorceress? You?\u201d</p>\n<p>Merlin gave him a wry smile. \u201cI do have some natural talents, you know.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou were saying goodbye to me,\u201d Arthur said, remembering. \u201cThe day I began to walk around again after waking up from the fever.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou couldn\u2019t have told me you were a sorcerer even then, when you knew you were going to die?\u201d</p>\n<p>Merlin bowed his head, thinking. \u201cI suppose I didn\u2019t want you to remember me like that. I wanted you to remember me as your friend.\u201d</p>\n<p>Arthur stood there, letting it all sink in. He wanted to puzzle over the decision of what to do with Merlin now, but all he could think of was what would have happened if Merlin had indeed given his life that day, Arthur never knowing what he did for him. How long would it have taken him to find out? How would Arthur have felt when they brought in Merlin\u2019s body? In all likelihood, there wouldn\u2019t <em>be</em> a body and Arthur would believe Merlin to be missing. How long would Arthur wait before replacing his manservant? How long before his memory would fade?</p>\n<p>\u201cI know I\u2019m a sorcerer,\u201d Merlin began, and Arthur felt another rush of anger from just hearing the words. \u201cAnd my word doesn\u2019t count for anything. And I would lie to you, but never about what matters. I only lied because I was scared, and it just got harder and harder the longer I waited. But I couldn\u2019t let Lady Angora die when I could do something about it. I would have magicked Gwen from the pyre in front of the king if I had to. I would rather die an agonizing death than to see you die. Sometimes it scares me, what I would do to see you live. If that isn\u2019t answer enough to any question you have of me, then I\u2019ll gladly walk into the fire myself.\u201d</p>\n<p>There was nothing for it; Arthur turned away, breathing harshly, hearing the pounding of his own heart. Arthur was weak. He was being manipulated again. His father warned him of sorcerers, that they bear no sign of the mark. There is no sense of evil. If ever there was an enchanter who fit this description, it was Merlin. Merlin who had made an idiot of him, had sailed below Arthur\u2019s notice, had known how to get Arthur to trust him and care about him.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou <em>certainly</em> know what to say to make a fool of me,\u201d Arthur drawled, turning back to Merlin, forcing himself to see the revealed sorcerer behind the mask of his friend. He wouldn\u2019t appear. \u201cYou are banished from here. You must leave this place.\u201d</p>\n<p>Merlin, the daft idiot, <em>shook his head</em>. \u201cI won\u2019t leave.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMost would be pleased that I extended that much lenience. Do you <em>want</em> to be executed?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI won\u2019t leave you. You need me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHow arrogant of you. I\u2019d say I didn\u2019t know you had it in you, but I don\u2019t know <em>what</em> you are anymore.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou need me. And I need <em>you</em>. I was born like this, born with magic, and all my life I have seen it as a burden and something to be ashamed of. But coming here, and protecting you, it has given it <em>meaning</em>. It\u2019s like I was born this way for a reason, for a destiny. By asking me to leave here, you\u2019re asking me to take away the only thing that gave my life meaning.\u201d</p>\n<p>Arthur, enraged, took Merlin by the shoulders and shook him, despite knowing that Merlin could easily eviscerate him with a hot poker.</p>\n<p>\u201cFind another destiny!\u201d he yelled into Merlin\u2019s face. Merlin gripped Arthur\u2019s upper arms tightly, less like he was trying to fight than he was trying to keep himself from falling off a cliff face.</p>\n<p>\u201cArthur, just <em>listen to me..</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI won\u2019t watch you die!\u201d Arthur blanched at his words the same time as Merlin gasped and flushed from them. Then Merlin did the unthinkable, and leaned forward and caught Arthur\u2019s mouth with his own. Arthur\u2019s eyes fell closed and he was kissing back fiercely, anger coursing through his veins. His hands moved from their grip on Merlin\u2019s shoulders to slide down Merlin\u2019s back, possessive. Merlin moved his hands to Arthur\u2019s hips and Arthur gasped into Merlin\u2019s mouth, the kiss turning desperate. He moved one hand to grab the back of Merlin\u2019s neck, fingers pushing into his hair, using the hold to angle Merlin\u2019s head until the kiss impossibly deepened. It went on and on, stretching impossibly long. Arthur was shivering, a slow fire burning down his spine. As it was, he tried to block out his fears, to stop all this, but all he could imagine was Merlin screaming in agony, flames engulfing him, and Arthur knew he could never watch that happen. He would have dove into the flames himself, in front of his father and Camelot.</p>\n<p>Merlin made a small sound in the back of his throat, and Arthur felt his fingers slide minutely into his trousers. Arthur growled and backed Merlin up to the table, getting a knee between Merlin\u2019s legs and scrabbling at his trouser lacings. Merlin broke the kiss to pant hot and wet into Arthur\u2019s neck, unskillfully trying to undo Arthur\u2019s pants in return. Finally, they both managed to push enough clothing aside and they moved together, resuming their kiss, moaning into each other\u2019s mouths as their cocks slid between their bodies, the small amount of friction enough to leave them shaking and gasping. It didn\u2019t last long. Merlin came first, crying out softly, shuddering. Arthur pulled away enough to look at Merlin, his emotions all over the place, and saw that Merlin had a huge, ridiculous, self-satisfied look on his face like he did when he put Arthur\u2019s armor on properly or he solved the riddle of how to drink poison from a single goblet, and Arthur, surprised, began to laugh as he went over the edge.</p>\n<p>\u201cAm I that bad?\u201d Merlin asked, amused. Arthur kept huffing out breaths of laughter as he came down, drunkenly resting his forehead against Merlin\u2019s. He turned serious as a minute passed and he began to think again. Sensing the change, Merlin quieted as well, his arms holding Arthur a bit tighter. Arthur drug his head from Merlin\u2019s and looked at him, even if what he really wanted to do was manfully flee from having to face this right now, but he\u2019d be damned if he was going to run from <em>Merlin</em>. Even if he was a big powerful sorcerer, the notion itself was too ridiculous and he\u2019d rather be struck dead.</p>\n<p>\u201cIf I ordered you not to save her, would you do it anyway?\u201d</p>\n<p>Merlin hesitated a moment, but then nodded firmly, a determined glint in his eye. \u201cWould you stop me?\u201d Merlin asked.</p>\n<p>Arthur gave it a few ticks, then grudgingly shook his head. Merlin gave him a look of surprised glee.</p>\n<p>\u201cArthur, the spell!\u201d he said, smiling.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat about it?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t answer right away. Arthur, what is your favorite type of food?\u201d</p>\n<p>Arthur, in a daze, drug up a lie. \u201cPorridge.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou did it!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOr the Lady Angora decided to lift the spell.\u201d</p>\n<p>Merlin frowned at him, deflating. Good <em>god</em>, was Arthur really feeling sorry for wiping that joy from Merlin\u2019s face? Apparently he was, because he pulled away, hitching up his trousers as regally as one could ever manage. Misinterpreting the action, Merlin frowned further, not so regally righting his own ruined clothing.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, come on then,\u201d Arthur said, as lightly as he could manage. \u201cShow me what you can do.\u201d</p>\n<p>Merlin smiled <em>brilliantly</em>.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe how bloody simple that was,\u201d Arthur raged as the three of them rode slowly from Camelot, the surrounding woods extremely dark from there being no moon. It was windy and Lady Angora was riding in front of him, recuperating from her near death experience, hair tickling Arthur\u2019s nose incessantly.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat did you expect?\u201d Merlin countered, having the gall to sound even the least bit smug.</p>\n<p>\u201cAll this time you knew that all you had to do was bat your eyelashes and keys would fly to your hands. I can\u2019t even begin to count the number of times that would have been helpful to know.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not like I can do magic all the time like that, especially with others watching. I tend to save it for when you decide to bravely get yourself killed. I don\u2019t know how you survived so long before I came to Camelot.</p>\n<p>\u201cNot everyone has to rely on <em>magic</em> to get along, <em>Merlin</em>,\u201d he scoffed, cursing as another tree branch scraped his face. \u201cYou think you can somehow summon a <em>light</em> or is that too mundane?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat depends on if you\u2019re admitting that you need magic right now.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI <em>don\u2019t need magic</em> to navigate a forest I\u2019ve been playing in my entire life,\u201d he announced scornfully right before he smacked into a low hanging branch. Merlin laughed delightedly and Arthur was beginning to change his mind about keeping Merlin safe.</p>\n<p>Except not for a second, and that <em>really</em> put Arthur in a bad mood.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll summon a light, even if you don\u2019t need it <em>sire</em>.\u201d Merlin intoned a spell in a language that never stopped setting Arthur\u2019s teeth on edge, years of hating and fearing it twisting through him. Arthur almost fell out of his saddle as a familiar blue orb of light floated a few feet in front of them, illuminating the path. Stunned speechless, Arthur looked over at Merlin, who had a matching little orb in his palm. Merlin didn\u2019t look smug now. He looked faintly sheepish and like he had done that spell without thinking.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt was you,\u201d Arthur said, wonder lacing his voice because he was unable to hide it. That had been the first time he had ever known that magic could be used for good.</p>\n<p>\u201cGaius told me. I didn\u2019t know how I did it, as I was unconscious at the time, but he said I kept calling out for you, sensing danger, and we figured out what spell I used later.\u201d</p>\n<p>Arthur continued to stare at Merlin as more and more pieces fit, how even if all other magic in the world was evil and dark and should be eradicated, Merlin\u2019s magic was <em>good</em> or maybe it was all the same magic and Merlin was just one of many that used it like this. Merlin blushed a little, turning away and Arthur tried to collect himself as he realized he had probably been gazing at Merlin in a decidedly besotted way, framed by soft magical light.</p>\n<p>They reached a crossroad and Arthur dismounted and helped Lady Angora to the ground.</p>\n<p>\u201cWill you be all right?\u201d Merlin asked gently, handing her a bag filled with food, a change of clothes, and a bit of money.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said, quite honestly and sadly. \u201cI can\u2019t go home. My father has disowned me to retain the kingdom\u2019s alliance with Camelot. But I\u2019ll be okay, I still have my magic and I know how to weave. I can blend in at a village, change my looks a little. I just\u2026will miss my home, family, and friends.\u201d</p>\n<p>She looked down at the ground, radiating pain. Arthur briefly imagined having to be exiled from Camelot. It would be a fate worse than death for him. He tentatively reached up and placed a hand on her shoulder.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhen I am king, you will be welcome in Camelot,\u201d he told her. It was the first promise he would make as king and he knew that it wasn\u2019t entirely directed toward her. He felt Merlin at his back, and hoped that Merlin understood that when he was king, Merlin would never have to fear again.</p>\n<p>She looked up again and smiled. \u201cI shall be patiently awaiting that day, your highness. Until then, may you be well.\u201d</p>\n<p>She walked down one of the roads, a day\u2019s ride from the nearest village. Arthur turned to look at Merlin, and Merlin was looking at him like Arthur had just returned from hanging the moon. Arthur, for the first time, terribly and consciously wanted to kiss Merlin. He then realised that he <em>could</em>, so he did, gently and with purpose. Merlin stopped the kiss, his hands cupping Arthur\u2019s face in an entirely girly manner that Arthur did not enjoy at all, really.</p>\n<p>\u201cI think you\u2019ll be a decent king, Arthur Pendragon.\u201d</p>\n<p>Arthur scowled. \u201c<em>Decent</em>? If I ever manage to get you to behave like a decent manservant for a single day, I\u2019ll become a legend.\u201d</p>"
