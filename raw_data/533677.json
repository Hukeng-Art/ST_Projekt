  "text": "<p>Laura loved thunder storms.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Peter told her once that thunder was the sound of clouds crashing into one another, and she didn\u2019t seem to care that it wasn\u2019t true. She liked the idea that even the air could roar when it was knocked about.\u00a0</p>\n<p>They lived in the south for a while, and when the storms blew in she would run outside to stand barefoot on the warm blacktop and throw her arms out and her head back and spin and spin and spin.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The night Derek rolls into Beacon Hills, a storm rolls in with him. It feels like it\u2019s been following him for days. Over state borders, into California and then up, keeping pace as the trees got thicker and greener all around the highway. When he finally shuts the car off in the shadow of his childhood home, the storm seems to stop and hover overhead. Water pelts down from the sky with no sign of stopping and the clouds rumble in the distance.</p>\n<p>The house smells like her. He follows the scent through the rooms and it feels like trailing after her ghost, looking at the things she looked at and touching the things she touched. He finds the room in the tunnels where she was staying littered with her clothes, and her books, and her notes scribbled on bits of paper. He reads through them but none of it means much to him.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s been driving for three days. The link between alpha and beta isn\u2019t meant to be stretched over thousands of miles and even if it weren\u2019t tugging at him constantly, pulling him to follow her, the guilt was more than enough to get him moving. Eventually.\u00a0</p>\n<p>But the link is gone now. In the middle of the second day of his drive, Derek had to stop and pull over and puke on the side of the road. He pretended that he didn\u2019t know what it meant.</p>\n<p>But he knows.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He finds an old shovel out back but he doesn\u2019t dig the hole.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Instead, he leans against the house - gently, because it\u2019s frail in places - and he listens to the dogs and the men running around in the woods nearby. He imagines digging the hole, and finding Laura alive, and having to tell her that he was so worried that he dug a hole. He imagines her laughing at him.</p>\n<p>* * *</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t think Ms. Morell likes me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Scott\u2019s setting the leg of a little yellow corgi while Stiles tries to study one of the books on herbs and powders that Deaton gave him. Across the room, Morell\u2019s watching Deaton attempt to give Derek and his pack lessons in how to use the healing side of their werewolf abilities. Isaac, Erica, and Boyd are all doing fine, but Peter is sitting behind Deaton and flashing his eyes at Derek\u2019s canine patient every time Derek starts to get the hang of what Deaton is telling him to do.\u00a0Each time, the dog panics and Derek gets frustrated and Deaton scowls and scolds him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The noise is beginning to grate on Stiles\u2019 nerves. \u201cNonsense,\u201d he says, because Scott\u2019s still waiting for a response. He keeps his eyes focused on the book, trying to figure out where he was when he stopped paying attention to the words. \u201cYou\u2019re adorable and chock full of valor. What\u2019s not to love?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Scott doesn\u2019t say anything, but Stiles can feel him staring. When he finally looks up, Scott\u2019s gaze flicks across the room and Stiles follows it to where Morell is cleaning her nails with the tip of a wickedly curved dagger.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Stiles sighs. \u201cI wish I could pull that off.\u201d</p>\n<p>Morell glances up at them and Scott tries to wave. She glares and goes back to watching Derek\u2019s dog freak out.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cShe hates me,\u201d declares Scott.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t hate you,\u201d says Stiles. \u201cIt\u2019s just that you\u2019re so\u2026<em>nice</em>.\u201d Scott gives him a look that\u2019s heavy with disbelief and Stiles ignores it. \u201cIt makes her want to puke a little. Besides, she doesn\u2019t really like anyone. I don\u2019t think she likes Deaton half the time.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShe likes you,\u201d says Scott.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Stiles scoffs.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYesterday she said you weren\u2019t completely useless.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, I see what you mean. I can really feel the love.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cComing from her that\u2019s a pretty big compliment.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles can\u2019t argue with that. He goes back to his book, but a moment later Scott\u2019s head jerks up the way it does when he\u2019s listening to something Stiles can\u2019t hear. Stiles glances over to see Isaac smirking while he mutters under his breath, and a moment later Scott laughs and then casts a guilty look in Morell\u2019s direction.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Stiles glares at the pages in front of him, but he can\u2019t seem to focus on the words. He glares at Isaac, but Isaac doesn\u2019t notice. Deaton\u2019s trying to tell Derek to give it one more shot with the dog and Peter\u2019s smirking behind him, so Stiles glares at him instead and his smirk just gets bigger.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Scott laughs again and across the room Isaac is grinning, so Stiles closes his book with a snap, mutters something about not being able to concentrate, and goes to stand next to Deaton, conveniently blocking the dog\u2019s view of Peter. Derek glares at him but Stiles pretends not to notice and Derek has to give it up when Deaton snaps at him to concentrate. He tries one last time, and the dog finally relaxes against his hand.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThere, now you\u2019re getting it,\u201d says Deaton.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Derek grumbles that he\u2019s doing the same thing he\u2019s been doing, but he looks pleased just the same.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cPerhaps Stiles is your lucky charm,\u201d says Peter. Stiles and Derek both turn to glare at him, but it only makes him laugh.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Later, on the drive home, Stiles says, \u201cHave you noticed that Peter\u2019s been trying to mess with Derek?\u201d</p>\n<p>Judging by the way Scott turns to stare at him, Stiles guesses that he hasn\u2019t. \u201cSo what?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo he\u2019s up to something,\u201d says Stiles, but Scott doesn\u2019t display an appropriate amount of concern at that so Stiles adds, \u201cthe last time he was up to something eight people died.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMaybe he\u2019s only mad at Derek this time. Derek did rip his throat out.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d says Stiles, \u201cand Allison and I <em>set him on fire.</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>Scott taps his fingers against his door while he thinks about that. \u201cWhat do you want me to do?\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles shrugs. \u201cMaybe tell your buddy Isaac to keep an eye on him.\u201d Even to his own ears it sounds catty, but Scott just nods and agrees to bring it up the next time he and Isaac hang out.\u00a0</p>\n<p>* * *</p>\n<p>Stiles is waiting for a to-go order in the lobby of a Greek restaurant a week later when the woman at the counter says, \u201cWhat\u2019s the name? Hale? Okay, your order will be ready in about twenty minutes.\u201d Her name tag just says \u2018Breezy\u2019 and she hangs up the phone with a smile and leaves to go hang the ticket for the cooks.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Stiles rolls his eyes. He\u2019s fairly certain that Beacon Hills was a lot bigger before Derek moved back.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The phone is ringing again when Breezy returns, and Stiles tones her out until he hears, \u201cCancel the <em>whole</em> order?\u201d She looks annoyed. \u201cYeah, of course that\u2019s fine. Have a good day, sir.\u201d The words are polite but the last part sounds astonishingly like \u2018go screw yourself.\u2019 She hangs up, rolls her eyes, and turns to go retrieve the ticket.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWait!\u201d Stiles jumps up and darts over to the counter. \u201cWas that call to cancel the Hale order?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d she says slowly, \u201cwhy?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWas it the same voice?\u201d</p>\n<p>She frowns. \u201cIt was a guy.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut was it the <em>same</em> guy?\u201d</p>\n<p>She shrugs.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t cancel it.\u201d</p>\n<p>She starts to shake her head and takes a half-step back, so Stiles says, \u201cI\u2019ll pay for it.\u201d She thinks about it for a moment and then shrugs and rings it up for him. It comes in somewhere around fifty bucks and Stiles glares at the register for a second before grumbling and pulling out his card. \u201cDon\u2019t tell him I did this. Say it was paid by a masked vigilante who used cash. Actually, don\u2019t tell him that either, he\u2019ll know that was me.\u201d</p>\n<p>She smiles at him and he forces a smile in return, signs for the card, and goes back to his seat with a sigh.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Derek walks in ten minutes later and Stiles focuses very hard on looking like he\u2019s playing games on his phone so it won\u2019t look like he\u2019s listening when Derek tells Breezy that he\u2019s there to pick up the Hale order and asks if he can pay for it. Breezy tells him cheerfully that it\u2019s already been taken care of and Stiles risks a glance up since Derek\u2019s back is to him. He can\u2019t see Derek\u2019s face but Breezy\u2019s smile is beginning to falter.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cBy who?\u201d demands Derek finally.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Stiles goes back to his phone, but in his peripheral vision he sees Derek turn in his direction and he\u2019s sure that Breezy looked at him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cStiles,\u201d snaps Derek.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Stiles glances up over the screen. \u201cDerek.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDid you pay for my order?\u201d Derek sounds remarkably as if he\u2019s accusing someone of being a serial puppy kicker.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOh yeah,\u201d says Stiles, voice dripping with sarcasm, \u201cit\u2019s my new thing. I call it \u2018wasting money on people who hate me.\u2019 It\u2019s gonna be bigger than planking.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek rolls his eyes. Further along the counter, beneath a sign that says \u2018pick-up,\u2019 someone calls out Stiles\u2019 order number and he tries not to sprint over to it and run from the shop, because that would make him look guilty. He can feel Derek\u2019s eyes burning holes in the back of his skull all the way out the door but he keeps his own eyes firmly forward. After all, not looking back is the only way to walk away from a disaster with any dignity.\u00a0</p>\n<p>* * *</p>\n<p>A month later Derek\u2019s car runs out of gas in the middle of a long stretch of road just outside of town and he\u2019s actually really, really happy about it. It\u2019s not that he <em>likes</em> being miserable, it\u2019s just that good things don\u2019t often happen to him. It\u2019s a truth he\u2019s learned to accept. His life, essentially, has amounted to a couple decades of proof that Murphy\u2019s Law is true.</p>\n<p>Or at least, that had been the case until this last month in Beacon Hills. The alphas hadn\u2019t made a move yet, the hunters were quiet, Scott was working his way through summer school and the pack, though they\u2019d never been exactly stable, seemed to be operating smoothly.\u00a0</p>\n<p>For four long weeks, Derek has been waiting for the other shoe to drop. And as if to add to that anxiety, nice things keep happening to him. He doesn\u2019t know how else to describe it. He gets discounts at the shops and restaurants he frequents in town, every trip to the grocery store is a weird series of finding his favorite items <em>almost</em> sold out but not quite - there\u2019s always just one left, like it was set aside for him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The old women of the Neighborhood Watch have taken to offering him cookies and pastries whenever he walks past their favorite cafe, and he wouldn\u2019t think anything of it except that he\u2019s seen them slap away the hands of people who came after him expecting the same treatment.\u00a0</p>\n<p>So the car thing is inconvenient, but it also feels like life is finally getting back to normal. Of course, it\u2019s also raining, and his phone is dead, and he\u2019s a few miles from the nearest gas station. All in all it\u2019s a perfect set up for the beginning of a movie about something horrible in the woods that eats tourists.\u00a0</p>\n<p>But Derek <em>is</em> the something horrible in the woods (not that he eats tourists), so he sucks it up and starts walking. Half an hour later he\u2019s soaked to the bone, miserable, and kicking himself for never remembering to plug his stupid phone in. He hears the sound of a car coming up behind him and turns. He\u2019s not the sort of person that generally gets picked up off the side of the road but given his odd streak of \u2018luck\u2019 lately, he still manages to be hopeful.\u00a0</p>\n<p>When he realizes that the vehicle quickly gaining on him is a familiar blue jeep, he decides that he is definitely the butt of some sort of cosmic joke. He\u2019s a little surprised when the jeep actually slows to a stop and Stiles leans over to shove the passenger door open. He considers ignoring the invitation, but walking in wet jeans is marginally less appealing than talking to Stiles, so he sighs and gets in.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhere are we going?\u201d asks Stiles.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cGas station.\u201d Derek folds his arms and leans against his door.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Stiles laughs, but it chokes off when Derek glares at him. That doesn\u2019t stop him from saying, \u201cYou ran out of gas?\u201d like it\u2019s the funniest thing he\u2019s heard all day.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Derek has no intention of answering, but Stiles doesn\u2019t say anything else, he just waits. If prompted, Derek probably wouldn\u2019t be able to explain how that\u2019s different from just being quiet, but it is, so eventually he mutters, \u201cI\u2019ve been avoiding the gas station.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe guy that works there keeps talking to me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cReally.\u201d Stiles\u2019 voice is completely flat but the way the corners of his mouth begin to curl up heralds more laughter.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d Derek grates out, \u201che\u2019s never spoken to me before and now he talks every time I show up. Just wanders out of his little mini mart thing and starts chatting. It\u2019s weird. And creepy.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>That\u2019s</em> what creeps you out?\u201d asks Stiles. \u201cPeople being nice?\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek opens his mouth to protest, but actually that\u2019s exactly what creeps him out so he closes it again and glares.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d says Stiles.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not just him.\u201d Derek knows he sounds defensive but he\u2019s too tired and miserable to care. \u201cEveryone in town\u2019s been doing it. I\u2019d blame the alphas but-\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles erupts into laughter, which is actually the same thing that Erica did on the one occasion that Derek mentioned his concerns to her, and not for the first time Derek considers just killing them all and starting over somewhere new.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>What</em>?\u201d he demands.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSorry,\u201d says Stiles, but he doesn\u2019t sound it. \u201cIt\u2019s not the alphas.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek narrows his eyes. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLook - I\u2019m really sorry. I guess I sort of needed a project, because Scott\u2019s been spending all his time with Isaac and -\u201d he glances up and notices Derek\u2019s still glaring at him and swallows.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd your new project was me?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>No</em>,\u201d says Stiles immediately. He glances at Derek again. \u201cNot exactly. Sort of - I was just trying to stop Peter from making you miserable.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Why</em>?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBecause things that Peter wants are generally the opposite of the things that I want. Because he bit Scott and hurt Lydia and I\u2019d just - much rather have you be the alpha.\u201d Stiles shrugs as they pull into the gas station and when he shuts off the engine he looks up and Derek still can\u2019t find any trace of a lie or a joke in his face.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cBut how-\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles laughs again. \u201cMost of it was actually Ruth.\u201d Derek\u2019s never met anyone named Ruth and it must show on his face because Stiles adds, \u201cShe\u2019s the old lady that lives across the street from me. She started helping me out after Peter recruited Rhonda - you should look out for her, by the way. She lives on Scott\u2019s street and she\u2019s vicious.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy would Ruth help you -\u201d Derek tries to come up with a word for what Stiles has been doing but he can\u2019t.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Stiles suddenly looks twice as guilty and shifts in his seat. \u201cAbout that. I guess she saw you climb in through my window and she\u2019s seen us around...together...\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek raises an eyebrow and Stiles sighs, his red cheeks getting redder.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cShe thinks we\u2019re dating.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek\u2019s eyes narrow and Stiles winces. \u201cAnd you corrected her.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI thought she\u2019d be less likely to help if I did, so...no. No I did not.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek\u2019s hand shoots out out to smack Stiles\u2019 head into the steering wheel again but Stiles jerks away, pressing his back into the door.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey!\u201d he snaps, holding up his hands and pointing an accusing finger at Derek. \u201cI was trying to help, okay? Besides, what do you care what Ruth thinks?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI <em>don\u2019t</em> care what Ruth thinks,\u201d snaps Derek, \u201cI care what Ruth <em>tells people</em> - specifically <em>armed</em> people - like your father. You\u2019re underage, Stiles, I could get arrested! <em>Again.\u201d</em></p>\n<p>\u201cThey\u2019d need proof to arrest you,\u201d says Stiles dismissively.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI could get <em>shot</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles tries to roll his eyes and shrug that off like it\u2019s completely ridiculous. \u201cMy dad\u2019s not a nutjob.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek doesn\u2019t grace that with a response.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay, fine, you could get shot. But it\u2019s not like he\u2019s some wolfsbane-toting hunter type. It\u2019ll just be a regular bullet.\u201d Stiles actually reaches out and pats Derek\u2019s arm in what he probably thinks is a reassuring manner. \u201cYou\u2019ll walk it off.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Stop helping me,</em>\u201d says Derek.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cRight now, or after-?\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek shoots him a glare and shoves his door open so he can go in and buy a gas container.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAfter,\u201d Stiles decides with a broad, fake smile. \u201cCool. I\u2019ll wait here.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek shuts the door with more force than necessary because he knows it\u2019ll annoy Stiles and Stiles mutters <em>way to be an asshole</em>\u00a0under his breath because he knows Derek will hear it. In the distance, the clouds begin to rumble.</p>\n<p>* * *<a name=\"new_stuff\" id=\"new_stuff\"></a></p>\n<p>The storm lasts for four days, and Stiles doesn\u2019t see Derek again after the first one. Probably that\u2019s for the best, since Derek wasn\u2019t exactly pleased with him, but Stiles doesn\u2019t see much of anyone else, either. He goes around to Ruth\u2019s for dinner one evening when the rain finally stops and he sits at her scrubbed wooden table with a glass of iced tea.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHow\u2019s that boy of yours doing?\u201d she has her back to him while she fiddles with a pot of chili on the stove. Stiles likes talking to Ruth for a lot of reasons, and one of them is that she refers to nearly everyone he knows as if they\u2019re all cute little kids, rather than werewolves or ex-lizard monsters or recently dead murderers.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He suddenly remembers Derek almost slamming his head into the steering wheel (again) and his smile falters. \u201cWe\u2019re not together,\u201d he admits finally. \u201cHe actually sort of hates me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles doesn\u2019t bother adding that he sort of hates Derek back, because then he\u2019d have to explain why he got her to help him do nice things for Derek in the first place and that\u2019s not a conversation he wants to have. Mostly because he doesn\u2019t have an explanation to offer that doesn\u2019t involve monsters and murder.\u00a0</p>\n<p>She turns, one hand still on the ladle and the other flying to her hip, and scowls at him. \u201cHe broke up with you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d says Stiles quickly, \u201cwe were never together. I just help him out sometimes, and I -\u201d he shrugs. \u201cYou\u2019ve seen him.\u201d</p>\n<p>Her eyebrows arch as she turns back to the stove. \u201cI have at that. The lord blessed that boy something fierce.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI think he\u2019d have taken his blessings elsewhere if it were up to him,\u201d says Stiles.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Ruth\u2019s shoulders tense and she spends a couple moments adding seasoning to the chili before she says, \u201cI don\u2019t know how he could hate somebody who helps him. I don\u2019t see a lot of people lining up for the opportunity.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles gives the back of her head a rueful smile. \u201cYou\u2019ve clearly never spoken to him.\u201d</p>\n<p>She humphs at that. \u201cDo you want me to call off those favors?\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles thinks about it for a moment before remembering the way Derek\u2019s voice sounded when he admitted that all the niceness was freaking him out. \u201cNo,\u201d he decides. \u201cHe might hate me, but he still deserves some happiness.\u201d</p>\n<p>Ruth gives him a fond smile, assuming that he\u2019s being kind rather than vindictive. Stiles doesn\u2019t correct her.\u00a0</p>\n<p>* * *</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about,\u201d says Peter.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNeither do I,\u201d adds Isaac from his spot at the kitchen table, where he\u2019s watching them with equal parts interest and trepidation.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Derek closes his eyes against Isaac\u2019s curiosity and Peter\u2019s amusement and tries to swallow his own burning frustration. He doesn\u2019t get headaches, but if he did he\u2019s pretty sure this is how they\u2019d start. \u201cI\u2019m going to bed.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut I\u2019m making eggplant lasagna,\u201d says Peter.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI hate eggplant,\u201d snaps Derek, but Peter knows that. If he liked it, Peter wouldn\u2019t be making it. He\u2019s almost through the doorway when Peter speaks again.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou should bite him.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek freezes. \u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAll that loyalty and resourcefulness,\u201d muses Peter, and when Derek turns to look at him his eyes are shining with a worrisome mixture of hunger and delight. \u201cImagine if it were directed at you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek can't think of anything to say that would fully express his disdain for that idea so he just glares and continues up to his room. He has neither the desire nor the intention to bite anyone, particularly someone he barely tolerates. Still, it takes him ages to fall asleep and he can\u2019t help thinking of all the ways that things would be different if he still had someone he could trust the way Scott can trust Stiles - if he still had Laura.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The trouble with missing the dead is that you begin to find them everywhere, and Stiles, for all his faults and annoyances, has more in common with Laura than Derek cares to admit. But Derek\u2019s tired of thinking about her and he\u2019s definitely tired of thinking about Stiles, so for his purposes the \u2018someone\u2019 he wishes for is bland and faceless and has little in common with either of them.\u00a0</p>\n<p>* * *</p>\n<p>Stiles stops by Ruth\u2019s on a cold Sunday morning in October to find Rhonda sitting in her kitchen. He glares but Rhonda waves away his disapproval like it\u2019s nothing more than a bothersome fly.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Stiles sits down across from her as Ruth comes in behind him, chattering away. He catches something about how she and Rhonda got up early and went shopping at the Farmer\u2019s Market before Ruth sets a little package in front of him. She smiles. \u201cI saw it and I thought of you. It\u2019ll keep your head warm, since you insist on cutting off all your lovely hair.\u201d</p>\n<p>She runs a hand over his head as she turns away to get him a cup of tea. He tears the brown paper apart to reveal a fuzzy gray hat with the sort of long ear flaps that are meant to double as a scarf. The top of the hat is shaped like a wolf\u2019s head, and the flaps have little claws dangling from the bottom, just below the small pockets which Stiles can\u2019t imagine ever having a use for.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cTry it on,\u201d says Rhonda. She smirks at him in a way that makes him think she knows more about Peter than she\u2019s letting on, but then Ruth comes back with the tea and she watches Stiles expectantly so he tugs the hat onto his head. If nothing else, the way her face lights up means he\u2019s actually going to have to wear the damn thing. At least it\u2019s comfortable.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He plasters a big smile on his face and says, \u201cThanks.\u201d</p>\n<p>Ruth smiles back and runs her fingers over the soft faux fur of the hat. \u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d</p>\n<p>He has to run errands for his dad after brunch and on his way home he stops to get gas and pulls up to the pump behind a familiar black Camaro. He tries not to laugh at the look on Derek\u2019s face while the gas station attendant chatters away, but then he figures he\u2019s been slammed into enough things that he\u2019s allowed to find it funny, so he laughs anyway. He gets out, pays for his gas, sets up the pump to fill his tank and wanders over toward Derek\u2019s car to worm his way into the conversation. If there\u2019s anything Stiles is good at, it\u2019s talking.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He lures the attendant (a nice young man called Jerry) away from Derek, who sags against the side of the Camaro with a sigh. A moment later, Stiles brings the conversation to a stuttering halt and Jerry, after an uncomfortable, hesitant glance between them, retreats into the convenience store.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Derek doesn\u2019t say thank you.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou need to do something about Peter,\u201d Stiles tells him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Derek removes the gas pump from his car and doesn\u2019t meet Stiles\u2019 gaze. \u201cIs he bothering you?\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles blinks. The answer is yes - deprived of whatever joy and entertainment he was getting out of making Derek\u2019s life miserable, Peter has taken to turning up wherever Stiles happens to be and generally just being creepy. \u201cThat\u2019s not what I meant,\u201d says Stiles, because he set the guy on fire. As long as Peter\u2019s not outright trying to kill him, he figures he\u2019s doing okay.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The pack is another story. When school started back up, Scott insisted that Isaac be included in their morning carpool and Isaac then insisted that Erica and Boyd be included as well. Stiles is starting to feel like a chauffeur for lunar-sensitive teenagers, but he\u2019s also getting a lot of secondhand information about how things are going over at Derek\u2019s werewolf frat house.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s freaking out the other betas,\u201d he says. \u201cI know you think he\u2019s your responsibility or whatever, but Isaac and Erica and Boyd have never killed or mauled anyone, so I think they deserve priority. It\u2019s hard for them to relax or listen to you when he\u2019s standing around doing that creepy thing with his -\u201d Stiles gestures absently, but there\u2019s no one part of Peter that\u2019s creepier than all the other parts of Peter, so he ends up saying, \u201c- everything.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek doesn\u2019t respond, but he doesn\u2019t glare either. The gas pump feeding Stiles\u2019 car clicks off, so Stiles shoves his hands into the little pockets of his hat flaps. Their use, apparently, is to give him something to do with his hands during awkward silences. He starts backing up and Derek doesn\u2019t move, so Stiles waves at him without removing his hand from the pocket and the little flimsy claws dance through the air.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNice hat,\u201d says Derek.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Stiles puffs himself up. He\u2019s unreasonably proud of the hat, mostly because Ruth got it for him while he wasn\u2019t even around and it makes him feel special, so he says, \u201cYeah it is,\u201d like he\u2019s challenging Derek to disagree.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Derek rolls his eyes and Stiles shoots him a smug grin before turning around and going back to the jeep. He doesn\u2019t glance back again until he\u2019s putting the gas pump away, but when he does he catches Derek smirking as he climbs into the driver\u2019s seat of the Camaro.\u00a0</p>\n<p>* * *</p>\n<p>\u201cSorry, man, we\u2019re going out of town. My dad called out of nowhere and he\u2019s got this whole thing set up with his parents and my mom\u2019s parents and her mom says she has to go because now there\u2019s an olive branch involved or something - my mom\u2019s not happy about it.\u201d Scott gives a helpless shrug.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Stiles sighs. His dad has to work, and it won\u2019t be the first Thanksgiving he\u2019s ever spent alone, but that doesn\u2019t make the prospect any more pleasant. \u201cTell her I wish her good fortune and, should that fail, a hero\u2019s death.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re not going to battle.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUh-huh.\u201d</p>\n<p>Scott rolls his eyes and claps Stiles on the shoulder before taking off. His mom\u2019s picking him up for school for once, so Stiles drives Erica and Boyd home and then finds himself alone in the Jeep with Isaac, who looks less pleased the closer they get to the Hale house.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cGot any plans for the weekend?\u201d asks Stiles.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d says Isaac.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHow do you feel about almond pea soup?\u201d</p>\n<p>Isaac frowns and shrugs and says, \u201cOkay, I guess,\u201d so Stiles takes him to Ruth\u2019s. If nothing else, helping Isaac avoid Peter for a little while longer has to earn Stiles some brownie points. Since it seems that Isaac is becoming a permanent fixture in Scott\u2019s life, Stiles figures he\u2019ll have to budge up and make room for him the same way he did with Allison, and now seems as good a time to start as any.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI hope you don\u2019t mind I brought someone with me,\u201d he calls out when he walks into Ruth\u2019s house.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThe more the merrier,\u201d she calls back.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Stiles leads Isaac into the kitchen and introduces him, and Ruth showers him with questions and attention that make him look both grateful and slightly uncomfortable. Mostly she spends the meal talking about the Neighborhood Watch meetings and Rhonda\u2019s continued attempts to get the poor young man who runs them to die of embarrassment.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat are you doing for the holiday?\u201d she asks eventually, and they glance at each other before ducking their heads to focus on their food.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWell surely you\u2019re doing <em>something</em>,\u201d says Ruth.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Stiles suddenly and desperately doesn\u2019t want to tell her he doesn\u2019t have plans, so he turns to Isaac and asks, \u201cDoes that house have an oven?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Isaac looks up, his discomfort temporarily overridden by curiosity. \u201cYeah, that\u2019s actually one of the first \u2018improvements\u2019 Peter made. Derek\u2019s convinced he\u2019s going to use it to burn the rest of the place down while we sleep.\u201d</p>\n<p>Ruth laughs as if Isaac were joking and Stiles smiles to encourage that misconception. \u201cOkay,\u201d he says, \u201clet\u2019s table that discussion for later. On a scale of growling to evisceration, how pissed do you think Derek would be if we commandeered his kitchen to make a Thanksgiving feast?\u201d</p>\n<p>Isaac thinks about it. \u201cAt most I\u2019d say mild injury. Nothing life-threatening.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles should probably be more interested in why Derek\u2019s possible mild-injury-inducing rage doesn\u2019t concern him, but he\u2019s too busy acting as if that, too, was a joke. \u201cI can live with that. Do you want to commandeer Derek\u2019s kitchen to make a Thanksgiving feast?\u201d</p>\n<p>Isaac shrugs and nods and starts to smile. \u201cSure.\u201d</p>\n<p>* * *</p>\n<p>They barely manage to get the food into the kitchen before Peter arrives to see what all the noise is about.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cMake yourself useful,\u201d says Stiles, passing Peter onions and a cutting board, and to his surprise Peter goes to work on them without comment. Stiles and Isaac get the turkey stuffed and in the oven by the time Derek shuffles into the doorway and glares.</p>\n<p>\u201cMorning, sunshine,\u201d says Stiles cheerfully.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d demands Derek.</p>\n<p>Stiles thinks Derek is probably trying to look intimidating but between his disheveled hair and the way he has his arms wrapped around his middle and the fact that his pajama bottoms are too long and almost completely envelope his feet, he misses intimidating by a wide margin and falls somewhere in the vicinity of adorable.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Stiles swallows and pretends that \u2018adorable\u2019 hasn\u2019t entered his Derek Hale vocabulary.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s Thanksgiving,\u201d says Isaac by way of explanation.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Derek doesn\u2019t look impressed.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cEither get over here and help with the food prep or get out,\u201d says Stiles, \u201cyou\u2019re ruining the happy Thanksgiving vibe we\u2019ve been working on.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek narrows his eyes and mutters, \u201cThere better be coffee when I get back,\u201d before turning and disappearing back up the stairs.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDoes coffee affect werewolves?\u201d asks Stiles.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, he just likes it,\u201d says Peter.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s bitter and dark like his soul,\u201d adds Isaac. Stiles laughs but he also gets a fresh pot started because he really doesn\u2019t want to get torn to shreds. Especially not before dinner.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Derek returns half an hour later, still grumpy but properly dressed and fresh from a shower. He pours himself a large mug of coffee and leans against the counter in front of the sink and seems to bask in it as if it\u2019s the most delicious thing he\u2019s ever tasted. Stiles makes a mental note that Derek likes his coffee the same way the Sheriff likes his coffee, and then makes a mental note to erase that mental note because he doesn\u2019t care.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou finally got it right,\u201d Derek tells Isaac a few minutes later, after he\u2019s started his second cup and looks much more at peace with the world.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>I</em> got it right,\u201d Stiles corrects him, \u201cYou can repay me by skinning and halving those potatoes.\u201d He points at a bag of them on the counter next to the sink. Derek raises an eyebrow, which Stiles ignores, and when the second cup of coffee has been drained Derek actually grabs the bag of potatoes and starts washing them. Stiles manages not to do a victory fist-pump but it\u2019s close.\u00a0</p>\n<p>They spend nearly an hour working together to get all of the food ready to go, but most of the actual cooking doesn\u2019t need to happen until much later. Stiles ends up trying to get Isaac to teach him basic self defense and fighting techniques, but Isaac\u2019s not very good at it so Derek starts teaching both of them while Peter sits on the back of the couch and smirks.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Punching Derek, even with his permission, is a daunting task. Mostly because it feels a lot like punching a brick wall and has about as much effect. But Derek tells him he\u2019s getting better and Stiles figures Derek doesn\u2019t care enough about his delicate psyche to lie about it, so that\u2019s something.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Peter\u2019s somewhat less supportive. He pipes up, when Stiles takes a step back to nurse his aching knuckles, with, \u201cYou should just wear your wolf hat. No one will want to pick a fight with someone who\u2019d wear that thing in public.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek smirks and Isaac lets his fist drop and turns to stare. \u201cYou have a wolf hat?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll have you assholes know that it was a <em>gift</em>,\u201d says Stiles, \u201cfrom Ruth, who is considerably cooler than anyone here.\u201d When Derek\u2019s expression clouds at the mention of her, Stiles quickly adds, \u201cAnd who is now aware that I\u2019m single, by the way.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cReally? Because I was handed three pastries yesterday,\u201d says Derek.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOh come on,\u201d says Stiles, rolling his eyes, \u201cwho complains about free pastries?\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek glares.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAt least they\u2019re not bullets?\u201d offers Stiles.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Derek continues glaring while Peter snickers and Isaac looks somewhat lost.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cShe may think she\u2019s helping me win you over,\u201d admits Stiles. \u201cI had to give her a reason why we were doing nice things for you in the first place.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHang on,\u201d says Isaac, \u201cshe thought you were dating <em>Derek</em>?\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles bristles. \u201cTry not to sound <em>too</em> shocked. I happen to be a catch.\u201d</p>\n<p>Isaac ignores that. \u201cDating you comes with free pastries? Can <em>I </em>date you?\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles rolls his eyes. \u201cCan we go back to punching each other? Please?\u201d</p>\n<p>* * *</p>\n<p>Either the alphas don\u2019t hear him coming or they don\u2019t think he\u2019s a threat. There are three - a female and two males - all younger than the other alphas Stiles has seen from the pack so far. </p>\n<p>He\u2019d been having dinner with his dad when he got the call from Allison. \u201cTrouble,\u201d she\u2019d said, \u201cIsaac\u2019s in trouble.\u201d She gave him an address and he didn\u2019t wait for his dad\u2019s permission, he just took off. He had no idea how he was going to explain that, just like he had no idea why he thought he was just going to be able to walk up to the three Alphas with nothing but a baseball bat and take their new chew toy away from them.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He works out nicknames for them as he creeps forward. He started doing it the first time he and Scott had a run-in with their pack; they never seemed inclined to introduce themselves and Stiles needed some way to keep them straight in his head.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The guy who laughs at everything becomes Chuckles, and the other guy is Cupcake because he looks serious and rugged and Stiles expects to find the juxtaposition funny later. Isaac keeps running his mouth off at them and he\u2019s probably only doing it to help distract them until Stiles can get within striking range but Isaac\u2019s a little too good at riling them up. Before Stiles is close enough to do anything, the woman lashes out, claws glinting in the yellow streetlight before digging into Isaac\u2019s stomach. Isaac cries out and falls back.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Stiles decides to call the woman Slasher just before he brings his bat up to meet the back of her skull. She spins, dazed but not down. Stiles hits her again and she crumples.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He spends a little too much time panicking (<em>I did that, I really did that holy god-</em>), which only leaves him with a brief moment to realize that he doesn\u2019t have time to get the bat up to defend himself from Cupcake. Cupcake raises a clawed hand and snarls, and then makes another noise that Stiles isn\u2019t sure how to categorize as an arrow bursts through his head from the side.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Stiles doesn\u2019t even wait for him to hit the ground; he dodges to the side and comes up beside Chuckles, who\u2019s looking around, half-crouched, too busy trying to see where the arrow came from to defend himself against Stiles\u2019 bat. Another two hits and Chuckles stays down.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Stiles drags Isaac up off the ground, ignoring Isaac\u2019s cry of pain, and the two of them begin to shuffle back across the parking lot as fast as possible.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cMy jeep\u2019s not far,\u201d Stiles promises.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Isaac grunts, but he doesn\u2019t say anything. Stiles is holding one of Isaac\u2019s arms around his own shoulders to keep him upright and Isaac\u2019s other arm is wrapped around his stomach where Slasher mauled him. Stiles is so busy worrying about whether Isaac\u2019s even going to make it back to the jeep that he doesn\u2019t notice the car until it screeches to a halt in front of them and he looks up, horrified, to see his dad.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The Sheriff starts to get out and Stiles glances back at the three bodies in the parking lot. Two of them are already starting to stir.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cGet back in the car.\u201d Stiles pulls the back door open and shoves Isaac in. \u201cHe needs help and they\u2019re getting up, we have to go.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou bashed their heads in,\u201d says the Sheriff, and Stiles is still holding the bloody bat in one hand so he can\u2019t really argue with that. \u201cOne of them got shot with - with an <em>arrow?</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI know,\u201d says Stiles, \u201cI know it\u2019s a lot but they\u2019ll be fine. Fine enough to chase us if we don\u2019t leave <em>right now,</em> and Isaac\u2019s hurt, dad. We have to <em>go</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGet in the back.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles dives in and his dad sits down in the driver\u2019s seat and stares out the window at the two shapes climbing to their feet.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cGo,\u201d says Stiles, \u201cGo <em>now.</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>The Sheriff slams his door shut and pulls back out onto the road with a screech. Stiles doesn\u2019t waste time trying to convince him to go to the clinic, he just calls Melissa and tells her to get Dr. Fenris and a stretcher and meet them at the emergency entrance.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The Sheriff tries to tell Stiles to stay in the car when they get to the hospital but Isaac gets his arm back around Stiles\u2019 shoulders and won\u2019t let go, so both boys make it out of the police cruiser. Stiles doesn\u2019t wait for his dad\u2019s permission to start helping Isaac limp up to the building.</p>\n<p>Melissa and Fenris rush forward immediately to help Isaac onto the stretcher and Melissa disappears with him while Stiles grabs Fenris\u2019 arm to keep him from following.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t have time for your woe-is-me bullshit. Isaac\u2019s a werewolf and I don\u2019t know whether he\u2019s allergic to anything you\u2019ve got in there. I need you to help him as best you can without giving him anything until I can get someone down here who knows what he\u2019s doing.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t-\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles fixes him with a cold, hard glare. \u201cIf he dies because you gave him the wrong drugs, his alpha will kill you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Fenris swallows and nods and takes off and Stiles sags a little, running a bloody hand over his hair before looking up to see his father staring at him like he\u2019s never quite seen him before.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Stiles looks away and pulls his phone out. He calls Deaton first, and Deaton promises to be there in less than five minutes. Then he calls Derek.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d is apparently Derek\u2019s idea of an appropriate greeting.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIsaac got attacked. He\u2019s at the hospital, you have to get here now.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy the hell is he at a hospital?\u201d demands Derek, and Stiles can hear muffled noises as Derek does whatever he needs to do to get ready to leave wherever he happens to be. It sounds like he\u2019s pulling on pants, but Stiles forces his mind away from that train of thought.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cMy dad was driving,\u201d says Stiles. \u201cHe watched me bash a couple skulls in, he wasn\u2019t really in the mood to argue.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou did <em>what?</em>\u201d demands Derek, and in the background Stiles\u2019 can hear the slam of a door and footsteps on stairs.</p>\n<p>He hears Peter say, \u201cI told you-\u201d</p>\n<p>But Derek snaps at him to shut up and more doors slam before a car engine turns over. \u201cWhose skulls?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t know their names,\u201d says Stiles, \u201calphas, younger ones. Not too bright and not too skilled. They didn\u2019t even hear me coming.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Scott?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek swears and there\u2019s a scuffling noise as the phone gets passed off.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cBarring any unfortunate police activity, we should be there shortly,\u201d says Peter. \u201cI believe Derek has some colorful suggestions as to what Scott ought to do with his phone if he\u2019s not going to answer it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles doesn\u2019t bother mentioning that he hasn\u2019t actually tried calling Scott yet. \u201cSee you when I see you,\u201d he says, and he hangs up before Peter can respond.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He goes to call Scott but the Sheriff says, \u201cStop,\u201d and Stiles swallows and exits out of the recent contacts menu. He stares at his phone for a moment, wipes some of the blood off on his hoodie and shoves it in his pocket. It\u2019s quiet out - apparently the Beacon Hills E.R. isn\u2019t really an exciting place to be on a Tuesday night.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo,\u201d says the Sheriff, but Stiles can\u2019t quite meet his eyes. When the silence begins to drag out, he continues, \u201cReally? You\u2019re not going to offer me an explanation for this? For any of it? I need you to help me out here, Stiles, because I just drove you away from a crime scene and I don\u2019t even -\u201d He drags a hand down his face and then brings it back up to shield his eyes for a moment, like the sight of Stiles is painful. \u201cAll I can think is that nothing has made sense for over a year now, and the only person who\u2019s been at or around <em>all</em> the crime scenes is you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles\u2019 mouth falls open. \u201cI\u2019ve never killed anyone.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut you <em>know</em>,\u201d says the Sheriff, \u201cyou know who killed those people last year. Who killed Laura Hale and Kate Argent and all the others.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles doesn\u2019t deny that.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The Sheriff turns away from him for a moment, running his hands through his hair before spinning on his heel to face Stiles again. \u201cWho <em>are</em> you?\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles has no idea what to say to that, but his dad seems to expect an answer, so he says, \u201cI\u2019m your son.\u201d</p>\n<p>That earns him an ugly laugh. \u201cMy son? My son doesn\u2019t lie to me, my son doesn\u2019t protect murderers, my son doesn\u2019t <em>bash people\u2019s skulls in</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles looks down at his hands. They\u2019re still bloody, and it\u2019s Isaac\u2019s blood mostly but he still tucks them away beneath his arms. \u201cYou\u2019re wrong.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Please</em> tell me how,\u201d says the Sheriff.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not \u2018protecting a murderer,\u2019\u201d says Stiles, \u201c I don\u2019t give a flying fuck about <em>him</em>. I\u2019m protecting <em>you</em>. You can\u2019t arrest him - the holding cells couldn\u2019t even keep Isaac in and he\u2019s new at this. You have no way of holding <em>any</em> werewolf, much less a powerful psychotic one, so yeah, I lied.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd you know what? Those people tonight - they\u2019ll be <em>fine</em>. I did what I had to, to stop them from killing Isaac - who <em>still</em> might die, by the way. And if he does, those three <em>idiots</em> are going to turn up cold in a ditch somewhere and I\u2019m not going to waste my time being sad about it.\u201d</p>\n<p>The Sheriff\u2019s eyebrows shoot up for a moment before his eyes narrow. \u201cWerewolves?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIs that what you just said? My holding cells can\u2019t contain <em>werewolves</em>?\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles\u2019 mouth works for a moment but he can\u2019t really see a way out so he says, \u201cYeah, well, they can\u2019t.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWerewolves. Seriously? That\u2019s what you\u2019re going with?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI can get Scott to show you later, there\u2019s a whole face thing that happens, it\u2019s very cool. When it\u2019s not lethal. Which - Scott\u2019s never killed anyone, that\u2019s not-\u201d Stiles stops talking when he hears the squeal of tires and he turns to see the Camaro approaching. \u201cFor the record, Derek\u2019s never killed anyone either.\u201d He doesn\u2019t actually know if that\u2019s true but for his dad\u2019s sake he tries to sound sure.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDerek <em>Hale</em>?\u201d demands the Sheriff, as if there\u2019s a plethora of possibly murderous \u2018Derek\u2019s in Beacon Hills.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Derek\u2019s out of the car as soon as the keys are out of the ignition. \u201cWhere\u2019s Isaac?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMelissa took him. Deaton\u2019s on his way,\u201d says Stiles, and he points toward the sliding doors. Derek goes without sparing Stiles and the Sheriff another glance.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Peter slides out of the car and slinks up to stand nearer to Stiles than Stiles would like. He brushes invisible dust off his coat and offers the Sheriff a charming smile.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going in?\u201d asks Stiles pointedly.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not overly fond of hospitals,\u201d says Peter.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSorry - you\u2019re Peter Hale, aren\u2019t you? The missing coma patient?\u201d asks the Sheriff.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Peter\u2019s smile broadens. \u201cI am, thank you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat wasn\u2019t a compliment,\u201d says Stiles.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI can\u2019t help but notice that you\u2019re not in a coma,\u201d says the Sheriff.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d drawls Peter. \u201cPerks of being a werewolf.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Stiles turns to glare at him. \u201cDo you mind? We were in the middle of a private conversation.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI really don\u2019t,\u201d says Peter. \u201cCarry on.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re a dick,\u201d spits Stiles.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Peter just smirks at him. \u201cSays the boy who set me on fire.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles actually laughs, but it\u2019s a mean sound. \u201cYou know, I don\u2019t even have a comeback to that - I have <em>several</em>. Would you like a complete list or should I just pick the most important one?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTop three?\u201d asks Peter.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cScott, Laura, Lydia,\u201d says Stiles, ticking them off on his fingers.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Peter\u2019s eyebrows shoot up but Deaton and Scott arrive before he can say anything about it and Stiles turns away to lead them into the hospital. He knows they don\u2019t really need his help, but at least Peter won\u2019t follow him in. To his relief, his dad trails after them, leaving Peter alone in the dim light outside.\u00a0</p>\n<p>* * *</p>\n<p>It always starts the same way. The prickling of his skin itching to shift and warp and stretch, his bones aching to crack and reform, teeth and claws begging to come out, feet longing to\u00a0<em>run, run, run</em>.</p>\n<p>Once upon a time, Derek controlled the shift by thinking of the smell of his mother\u2019s hair as it fell around him when she leaned over to help him with his homework, or the sound of his father\u2019s laughter - a robust noise that could fill any room in their house. But all of that had started to feel like another lifetime. Or someone else\u2019s lifetime, maybe.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Pain keeps you human, so after the fire he latched onto that. Any time he felt the change sneaking up on him, he remembered the price his family had paid for his rash behavior. He watched the sag of Laura\u2019s shoulders and he measured the bags beneath her eyes and he remembered laying awake at night in those first months after they lost everything, listening to her stilted, shuddering breaths as she tried to keep him from hearing her cry.\u00a0</p>\n<p>That, in itself, had been enough, but his long list of sins just keeps getting longer with every misstep that leads to more death and violence.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Derek has plenty of reasons to be angry.\u00a0</p>\n<p>So it comes as a surprise when the anger suddenly isn\u2019t enough. Fenris is trying to keep Isaac stable but Isaac keeps crying out, his pain and terror nagging at Derek and making his claws and fangs start to grow as he paces in front of the door. He would have burst in long before now and knocked Fenris into next month, but Melissa is standing in the way with her hands on her hips. Her lips are drawn into a tight line and she smells like fear but she\u2019s glaring at him and she doesn\u2019t flinch when he growls.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey!\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek and Melissa both turn to see Scott, Deaton, Stiles, and the Sheriff approaching from the end of the hall.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhere the <em>hell</em> have you been?\u201d snaps Derek, but Deaton ignores him and Scott glares. Deaton goes right into the room without pausing but Scott stops when he reaches his mother to ask if she\u2019s alright.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cFine,\u201d says Melissa, without taking her eyes off Derek. She actually sounds sympathetic.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Scott gives Derek a wary look, but then Stiles says, \u201cIt\u2019s fine dude, go help the doc.\u201d</p>\n<p>Scott nods once, and disappears into Isaac\u2019s room.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDerek,\u201d says Stiles.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Derek grits his teeth even as they continue to grow and he eyes the door that he knows will take him to Isaac. He has no intention of listening to a bunch of platitudes, and he\u2019s about to take a step forward when a hand wraps around his elbow. He looks down, red eyes meeting brown ones, and wonders how Stiles got that close to him without him noticing.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Stiles\u2019 whole body is tense, he reeks of sweat and blood and fear, but he smiles. It\u2019s a real smile, and even if it\u2019s stretched a little too thin it still contains all the stubborn hope that Derek thought only Scott could be foolish enough to hang onto.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cEverything\u2019s going to be fine,\u201d says Stiles, and to Derek\u2019s surprise he isn\u2019t lying. He pulls his hand away before Derek can ask him to and just stands there with him and waits. The steady pumping of his heart is a more convincing argument for patience than anything anyone has said so far.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Eventually the door opens and Melissa stands aside and Fenris beckons and Derek\u2019s off in a rush to see Isaac, to sneak him out of the hospital and back home. There\u2019s no time to worry about the echo of Stiles\u2019 voice in his head or the ghost of his heartbeat.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Derek brushes it off, pretends to forget it, keeps his distance when Stiles and Scott come around to hang out with Isaac while he\u2019s couch-bound and healing. But Laura\u2019s birthday rolls around and he can\u2019t look at Peter so he drives out to a bunch of hills and trees he doesn\u2019t know and runs until his lungs burn and his legs ache. He stops to rest and feels his claws begin to slide out, and he tries to make himself angry, goes down his list starting with the first day Kate Argent smiled at him but it doesn\u2019t work.\u00a0</p>\n<p>For once, he\u2019s not angry. He\u2019s just tired and desperate. It feels like his skin is paper thin, like it\u2019ll collapse at the slightest bit of pressure and then he\u2019ll spill everywhere and he doesn\u2019t want to. He crouches down, curling in on himself, burying his head in his hands and he hears it again in the back of his mind - <em>everything\u2019s going to be fine</em>, and the steady thrum of truth, like Stiles has found some way to haunt him without having to die first.\u00a0</p>\n<p>It\u2019s already starting to get dark when he drives back to Beacon Hills, and by the time he reaches Stiles\u2019 house the stars are out. He parks on the road and slips behind the houses and up to the roof outside of Stiles\u2019 room. He doesn\u2019t knock, doesn\u2019t even really listen too closely, he just sits there with the house and the hum of electricity and all the little noises of the person moving around within. It feels strange - too warm, like stepping into a hot bath when your feet are ice cold. He leans his head back against the wall and focuses on Stiles\u2019 heartbeat until everything begins to feel calm, until his skin feels like skin again.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The window slides open and he jumps and starts to panic, but then Stiles pokes his head out and raises an eyebrow. \u201cMy dad\u2019s not here.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek\u2019s not sure what he was expecting to hear, but that wasn\u2019t it. He doesn\u2019t have any excuse for being on Stiles\u2019 roof, though, so he just says, \u201cOh.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m attempting to make dinner. If you want, you can come laugh at me as I fail.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI was just-\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles throws his hands up and shakes his head, says, \u201cDon\u2019t even want to know, dude,\u201d and vanishes back inside. He leaves the window open. \u201cIt\u2019s mac n\u2019 cheese night!\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek tells himself he only goes in because he has to find out how anyone could mess up macaroni and cheese. They have a long argument about whether the dish is better plain or with salsa and somehow Derek loses a bet that he doesn\u2019t remember wagering and gets roped into playing Call of Duty to settle the debt.\u00a0</p>\n<p>About an hour later, he remembers that this isn\u2019t his life. That they aren\u2019t friends and he has responsibilities and he can\u2019t sit around playing video games. The paper-thin sensation starts to return, as if every piece of him is fragile and exposed and he can\u2019t figure out why Stiles is just sitting there quietly rather than trying to break him apart.</p>\n<p>He starts trying to come up with a way to escape, but before he can say anything Stiles shuts the game off.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWindow\u2019s still open,\u201d he says.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Derek looks up at him, wonders if he should apologize or explain, but Stiles doesn\u2019t seem insulted or upset, so Derek just leaves.\u00a0</p>\n<p>* * *</p>\n<p>Stiles is freezing cold and pretty sure he\u2019s strained something by the time he fixes Ruth\u2019s satellite dish and goes back inside. He wipes his feet off and takes the hot chocolate she hands him and says, \u201cCan you write me a letter of recommendation?\u201d</p>\n<p>Her eyebrows furrow. \u201cFor fixing satellite dishes?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m going to apply for a friendship and I want to do it right.\u201d</p>\n<p>Ruth opens her mouth and then closes it again, but after a moment she seems to decide not to argue with him over what the \u2018right\u2019 way to go about making friends is. \u201cSure. When do you need it by?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhenever you get around to it,\u201d says Stiles. \u201cNo hurry.\u201d</p>\n<p>The next day as he\u2019s driving Scott, Erica, Isaac, and Boyd home he asks them the same thing.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIt feels like you\u2019re giving me a homework assignment,\u201d complains Scott.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI could write it for you,\u201d offers Stiles. \u201c\u2019Not only is Stiles my <em>best</em> friend and the <em>smartest</em> human being I know - aside from Lydia Martin, of course - he\u2019s the only reason I\u2019m still alive today, and I-\u2019\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll write it,\u201d says Scott, rolling his eyes.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cCan I write one?\u201d asks Boyd.\u00a0\u201dI\u2019ve got some observations to make about your character that start with the \u2018fuh\u2019 sound.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAll entries are welcome,\u201d says Stiles, \u201cbut I\u2019d appreciate it if you refrained from using inappropriate language.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you going to tell us what this is for?\u201d asks Erica.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, not really.\u201d</p>\n<p>* * *</p>\n<p>He spends the evening putting together a resume. Under \u2018Experience\u2019 it says things like, <em>Best Friend to Scott McCall (2004-Present), </em>and <em>Forced Acquaintance to Jackson Whittmore (2007-Present)</em> with duties listed underneath. Under \u2018Skills\u2019 he\u2019s written <em>Bullshitting</em> and nothing else. He stares at the blinking cursor for a while before wandering downstairs and plopping down on the couch. His dad glances at him a few times before muting the T.V.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou hate hockey.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d says Stiles.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSo what\u2019s up?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat would you say are some of my more admirable skills, as a friend?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, you\u2019re loyal. And dependable. And trustworthy, even if you aren\u2019t always honest.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI was hoping for more actionable stuff. Like what do I really bring to the table, in a friendship? Aside from being able to bullshit my way out of pretty much anything.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLanguage,\u201d chides his dad absently. He thinks for a moment. \u201cYou\u2019re a good judge of character, and you\u2019ve got good instincts.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles nods and offers his dad a smile. \u201cYeah, thanks.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat is this about? Why do you need to be able to bring anything to the table?\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles shrugs. \u201cI just don\u2019t feel like I can really <em>do</em> -\u201d he stops himself from saying \u2018anything\u2019 but he can\u2019t come up with another word to take its place so he just lets the sentence hang.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cFriendship isn\u2019t functional in an \u2018actionable\u2019 way, Stiles. Loyalty and insight and all those things may not be quantifiable or tangible but they\u2019re still assets. They\u2019re still important. And they make <em>you</em> important. Anyone would be lucky to have you as a friend and if someone\u2019s making you feel like that\u2019s not the case-\u201c</p>\n<p>\u201c-No, dad, that\u2019s not - it\u2019s not like that. Thanks,\u201d says Stiles.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, if it <em>was</em> like that, they\u2019d be wrong.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles leans over and hugs him. \u201cThanks,\u201d he says again, and he goes back upstairs to add\u00a0loyal and insightful to his list.</p>\n<p>He has four letters of recommendation (five if he counts Boyd\u2019s, but he doesn\u2019t really because it\u2019s only one sentence) within a week. He finishes writing his cover letter, clips everything together, slides it all into a big sturdy envelope, and writes a name and address on the front.</p>\n<p>The moment that\u2019s done, it\u2019s as if the envelope has transformed into something more than an envelope. It sits on his desk and he sits in his chair and it feels like they\u2019re having a staring contest, like it\u2019s daring him to put it in the mail. Like it has become something that\u2019s capable of daring him to do anything. He glares at it, feeling stubborn and contrary, and goes to bed.\u00a0</p>\n<p>* * *</p>\n<p>Derek spends most of Christmas Eve morning driving around trying to find everything he needs for what Isaac has described as his ideal Christmas dinner. His recovery is slow going, but he can finally walk around without too much pain, so at least he\u2019s making progress.\u00a0</p>\n<p>When Derek gets back to the dirt road that serves as his driveway, he finds a mail truck idling on the shoulder. He turns in and comes to a stop next to a mailman who seems to be debating whether or not he\u2019s prepared to follow the road into the woods to find the house. Derek rolls the window down and regrets it immediately; the guy <em>reeks</em> of fear.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cCan I help you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m supposed to deliver something but there\u2019s no mailbox.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek raises an eyebrow but the effect is lost because the mailman doesn\u2019t look at him. \u201cI\u2019m Derek Hale.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh good!\u201d The mailman turns and shoves a large envelope into Derek\u2019s window. He barely waits to make sure Derek grabs it before he retracts his hand, does a nervous little wave, and scampers back to his truck. Derek watches him drive away with a scowl and sniffs the envelope. It smells like fear and paper and it\u2019s addressed to him. He shrugs and drives up to the house.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He unloads the groceries and puts everything away before he finally turns his attention to his mail, tearing it open as he walks into the living room where Isaac is still camped out on his couch.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d asks Isaac.</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t know,\u201d says Derek. He reaches in and pulls out several papers that are held together by a binder clip. He stares at the one on top for a long time.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Now</em> what is it?\u201d asks Isaac.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAn application for friendship,\u201d says Derek, because that\u2019s what it says at the top of the cover letter.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Isaac frowns for a moment before something clicks. \u201cIs it from Stiles?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHow\u2019d you know?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s an application for friendship,\u201d scoffs Isaac, as if that explains everything. Derek can\u2019t think of anyone else who would actually put together an application so maybe it does. \u201cPlus, he asked everyone for letters of recommendation a couple weeks ago.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek nods absently.</p>\n<p>\u201cSit down so I can read it over your shoulder,\u201d says Isaac.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Derek finishes reading the cover letter, tugs it free from the binder clip and puts it back in the envelope before he sits down so that he and Isaac can read the rest together.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The letters of recommendation vary widely in tone. Ruth\u2019s is kind and heartfelt, Isaac and Erica\u2019s are both blunt but complimentary, and Scott\u2019s strikes Derek as being tongue-in-cheek. It begins, <em>Not only is Stiles my best friend and the smartest human being I know - aside from Lydia Martin, of course - but he\u2019s the only reason I\u2019m still alive and I don\u2019t know what I\u2019d do without him.</em> Those things may be true, but Derek can\u2019t imagine Scott saying them voluntarily.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Apparently Isaac can\u2019t either, because he says, \u201cHe didn\u2019t tell us anyone else would read these.\u201d</p>\n<p>The last page has one sentence on it, signed by Boyd, which just says, \u201cI\u2019ve met worse people.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek slides the papers back into the envelope and plays with the binder clip for a few minutes. \u201cWhat am I supposed to do with this?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI saw a picture on the internet of someone who strung them up and used them to hang pictures on the wall,\u201d says Isaac.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p>\n<p>Isaac hesitates. \u201cYou weren\u2019t talking about the binder clip.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNevermind.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek drops the binder clip back into the envelope with the papers and tries to find something else to do with his hands.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIs there a reason you can\u2019t just be friends with him?\u201d asks Isaac.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Derek leans back against the couch. \u201cThis doesn\u2019t require a response?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell if you wanted to play along there would need to be an interview and then, if you decide to hire him, a contract. But I don\u2019t think he\u2019s expecting you to. Stiles just...does things. Like getting the whole town to be nice to you. Or like when Lydia was having a hard time coming back to school and he set up that ice skating thing.\u201d Isaac thinks for a moment and then chokes and starts coughing.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Derek twists around to watch him. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d says Isaac, though he\u2019s clearly trying to hide something. \u201cFine. Absolutely fine.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek scowls at him but decides not to push it. \u201cPeter won\u2019t be around today, just so you know.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe have something against Christmas Eve?\u201d asks Isaac.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s his wedding anniversary,\u201d says Derek, and then he gets up and goes to the kitchen to get started on dinner.\u00a0</p>\n<p>* * *</p>\n<p>When Derek and Laura were little and they wouldn\u2019t go to sleep, their mother always strapped them into the car and drove them around town. She rolled all the windows down so they could smell the forest and the cool night air and she turned off the radio and sang to them in a language Derek can\u2019t remember anymore.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Laura had done it too, after the fire. She rumbled along the streets of dark, unfamiliar towns, sometimes for hours, with her arm hanging out the window and the music up so loud she couldn\u2019t hear herself think.</p>\n<p>Derek has been driving around at night a lot, lately, but he doesn\u2019t drive aimlessly the way his mom and Laura always had. He drives along scenic back roads and takes winding paths through subdivisions on a planned route that brings him by the houses of each pack member. He slows down as he passes them, finds their heartbeats, safe and steady and fast asleep, and then moves on.\u00a0</p>\n<p>It\u2019s a slow night, quiet and dark the way holiday nights usually are since most people are at home with their families. Erica, Isaac, and Boyd had fallen asleep in Derek\u2019s living room watching claymation Christmas movies, so his drive just includes Scott and Stiles. Scott\u2019s still awake, his window one of the the few on his street that are still illuminated, but he and his mother are safe so Derek moves on. He drives toward Stiles\u2019 house and wonders if macaroni nights are special occasions or if he\u2019s always welcome there. He wonders if climbing in through the window is like entering an alternate universe where he\u2019s allowed to sit around and make stupid jokes and fumble with controllers and complain that <em>he</em> certainly wouldn\u2019t be taken out that easily by mere bullets.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He wonders those things with one hand on the steering wheel and the other hand riding the icy wind that rushes by outside his window and he allows himself to keep wondering until he reaches Stiles\u2019 house and can\u2019t find a heartbeat.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The jeep is still in the driveway so Derek parks behind it and gets out, and he tries to write off the dark empty silence of the house and the faint smell of foreign wolves in the driveway but when he gets past Stiles' car he can see the symbol of the alpha pack painted on the door. He pulls out his phone and calls Stiles, but he can hear Stiles' phone ringing within the house so he hangs up and spends a long while staring at the slightly open door.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t smell blood, but not every death is bloody, and he finds that he wants very, very much not to find a body inside. He thinks about Laura and the hole he dug for her and how well wanting something not to be true had worked out for him then. He leans back against the front of the jeep, memorizes the scents of the alphas who came here, but he doesn\u2019t go in until it occurs to him that if he doesn\u2019t search the house someone else will have to. Someone like Scott.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Derek pushes the door open with his foot and performs a cursory search of each room, but he finds nothing - no body, no signs of a struggle, no ransom note. Stiles\u2019 phone is on his desk, and he\u2019s got five missed calls and two unread text messages. Derek looks long enough to see that the texts are from Scott and Allison but he doesn\u2019t read them. The phone calls are from Scott, Isaac, two from the Sheriff, and one from \u2018Grouch the Magic Wolfman.\u2019 Derek rolls his eyes.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He calls Scott on Stiles\u2019 phone.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cFinally! What was the emergency your dad got called in for?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cStiles is missing,\u201d says Derek. \u201cThe alpha symbol is on his door. I don\u2019t suppose you two idiots had any idea where they\u2019re squatting?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy would they want Stiles?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cProbably because he assaulted two of them.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIsaac-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cErica and Boyd are with him.\u201d Derek sits in Stiles\u2019 chair. \u201cThere\u2019s no note and I haven\u2019t gotten a threatening phone call, which means they either want something from him or they just want to teach him a lesson about what happens when you hit sociopaths over the head with a bat.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDo either of those options end with them sending him home alive?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cProbably not,\u201d says Derek.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cShit,\u201d says Scott.\u00a0</p>\n<p>They\u2019re both quiet for a moment before Derek swallows and closes his eyes and says, \u201cDo you think the Argents know where the alphas are?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re suggesting we ask the Argents for help?\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek rolls his eyes again. \u201cNo, you\u2019re right, we should just wait for them to send him back in pieces.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d says Scott, \u201c<em>you.</em> <em>You </em>are suggesting we ask the Argents for help? You flip out every time I even mention them.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t \u2018flip out,\u2019\u201d snaps Derek, \u201cI express valid concerns, and when exactly have I been wrong?\u201d</p>\n<p>Scott chooses not to answer that. \u201cAllison\u2019s not really talking to me at the moment. We need someone she and her dad will talk to without shooting first,\u201d says Scott.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSomeone like the Sheriff?\u201d</p>\n<p>* * *</p>\n<p>Stiles is really sick of being kidnapped. His skin is stiff where a trail of dried blood leads down from his temple, following the curve of his jaw and sliding down his neck to dip under his collar. His head throbs so furiously that he wants nothing more than to lose consciousness, but he can\u2019t lose consciousness because he\u2019s trying to keep up with Derek, who\u2019s dragging him relentlessly through the woods, away from the alpha den.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The alpha den which, as far as Stiles can tell, is currently being sieged by hunters.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He cries out when his right knee fails him and he goes down hard, but Derek\u2019s hand is fisted in the back of his shirt so he\u2019s yanked back to his feet in seconds. Derek loops Stiles\u2019 arm around his shoulders and keeps them moving.</p>\n<p>\u201cSorry,\u201d mumbles Stiles. Derek doesn\u2019t respond, and Stiles doesn\u2019t say anything else even though the wrist Derek\u2019s holding was already sprained and Derek\u2019s vice grip is making it worse. Stiles focuses on keeping his feet moving until they make it back to Derek\u2019s car, where Stiles falls into the passenger seat with a relieved noise that\u2019s somewhere between a groan and a sigh. He closes his eyes and listens to Derek\u2019s footsteps coming around the back of the car, Derek\u2019s door swinging open and slamming shut, the jingle of keys, the roar of the engine. Wheels crunch over gravel and then whisper over blacktop and Stiles slumps over, letting his head fall against the glass.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cStay awake,\u201d orders Derek.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not concussed, just tired,\u201d says Stiles.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Derek reaches over and pulls him upright. \u201cStay awake,\u201d he repeats. \u201cWhat did they want?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou,\u201d says Stiles.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cBut you know where I live,\u201d says Derek.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Stiles scowls. \u201cSo? I may not have super werewolf powers but I can control my mouth. I didn\u2019t tell them anything.\u201d</p>\n<p>\"Why not?\" The question ends up sounding more hostile than Derek wanted it to but he doesn\u2019t bother trying to smooth it over.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"I'm sorry, you're mad at me because I <em>didn't</em> give you up?\" demands Stiles.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"I'm mad because I don't understand why you wouldn't.\"</p>\n<p>Stiles\u2019 entire body tenses and he turns away from Derek for a moment before turning back and saying, \"Pull over.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Derek glances at him, biting back a wince at the bruises coloring his jaw and the blood caked along the side of his face. \"What-\"</p>\n<p>\"Pull over,\" repeats Stiles, and he doesn\u2019t sound annoyed or incredulous anymore, just quiet and furious and sad. Derek pulls the car over.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Stiles unbuckles his seatbelt and opens the car door and for a moment Derek thinks he\u2019s going to throw up but then he manages to get himself out of the seat before Derek can stop him. Derek sits there, stunned, as Stiles starts hobbling away.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Derek shakes himself and gets out of the car. \"What the hell are you doing?\"</p>\n<p>\"Storming off,\" says Stiles, even though he couldn\u2019t outpace a snail at the rate he\u2019s going.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"You're going to tear your knee up,\" says Derek. \"You won't be able to play lacrosse.\"</p>\n<p>Stiles keeps walking, apparently unimpressed with that argument. Derek crosses his arms and glares. The only other person who\u2019s been able to drive him to such incredible heights of frustration is Laura, and she had invested a lot of time and effort into finding the most efficient ways to piss him off. For Stiles, it seems to come naturally.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"Stiles, get back in the car.\"</p>\n<p>\"No.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek rolls his eyes skyward. \"<em>Why not?</em>\"</p>\n<p>Stiles spins to glare at him but his knee gives out again. Derek hurries over to help but Stiles pushes him away.</p>\n<p>\"What the hell is wrong with you?\" demands Derek.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"<em>You</em>, dumbass,\" says Stiles with a glare. \"Look, I know I'm not really a <em>great</em> person, and I realize that I'm not always easy to be around, but what exactly am I doing that keeps giving you the impression that I'm a colossal asshole?\"</p>\n<p>Derek stares at him. \"What?\"</p>\n<p>\"You keep pulling this crap, and I figured maybe when you did it in the pool it was because we didn't know each other very well but I thought - despite the fact that you haven't said anything about the application - that we were friends now. Or something like it.\"</p>\n<p>Derek folds his arms again, as if they could create any sort of useful barrier between him and the look that Stiles is giving him. \"Okay,\" he says.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"Okay,\" repeats Stiles, his voice flat and furious, and Derek feels like something is slipping away from him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"Yes, we're -\" Derek swallows. Stiles' expression is still stormy and Derek doesn\u2019t think agreeing with him will be enough. He tries again, this time using what he's begun to refer to in his head as Stiles-Speak, \"- as I understand it there's supposed to be some sort of interview process but I expect it'll go well.\"</p>\n<p>That earns him a laugh but it\u2019s not a very nice one. \"Really? You expect it to go well?\" sneers Stiles. \"Well in that case you should fire your HR person, because if they're hiring people that you expect are going to give you up at the drop of a hat, they're not doing a very good job.\"</p>\n<p>Derek\u2019s mouth nearly falls open. \"You're mad because I don't know why you didn't tell them where to find me?\"</p>\n<p>\"I'm mad because you <em>still</em> don't trust me,\" snaps Stiles.</p>\n<p>Derek takes a full step back and drops his gaze and a couple minutes pass in tense, miserable silence before Stiles sighs.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"Look my whole storming off thing was pretty badass as gestures go but I don't have my phone and I really can't walk back to town. Can you just help me up and give me a ride to the hospital and I'll let you go back to doing whatever it is you do?\"</p>\n<p>There are a lot of things Derek wants to say, like <em>I'm sorry</em> and <em>you're the first human I've carried on multiple conversations with since I was sixteen</em> and <em>I don't think you're a colossal asshole</em>, but instead he says, \"Sure,\" and helps Stiles back to the car.\u00a0</p>\n<p>* * *</p>\n<p>Isaac moves his legs to make room for Derek on the couch, but instead of picking up his book and reading like he usually does, Derek just sits there and glares at nothing.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Isaac glances around but he can\u2019t hear Peter anywhere nearby so he says, \"What's up?\"</p>\n<p>\"I don't want to talk about it,\" says Derek.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"Okay.\u201d Isaac goes back to reading.\u00a0</p>\n<p>About twenty minutes later Derek says, \"Stiles is angry.\"</p>\n<p>Isaac's eyebrows rise. He's already received several texts from Stiles on the subject so he says, \"I think that's a bit of an understatement.\"</p>\n<p>Derek glances at him and then away again and huffs out a breath.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"He likes you,\" says Isaac.</p>\n<p>\"I think your information is out of date,\" says Derek.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"No, it's not. I realized it when he sent you the application. Stiles does stuff like that, but he doesn't do it for everyone. The only other examples I could think of involved Lydia Martin.\"</p>\n<p>\"That's ridiculous,\" scoffs Derek, \"I'm -\" he tries to come up with a word for a moment and then just gestures at himself.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"I think your mirror is out of date,\" says Isaac.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Derek glares at him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Isaac goes back to his book.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"What am I supposed to do?\"\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"How the hell should I know?\" asks Isaac without looking up. \"You're both really weird. I can never tell if you're going to kill each other or start kissing.\"</p>\n<p>\"That's ridiculous,\" says Derek again.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"Next time you're together I'll film it so I can play it back for you later,\" mutters Isaac.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"Do you know when the library's usually open?\" asks Derek.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"Nope.\"</p>\n<p>Derek sighs and gets up. \"I'll be back later. Text me if you need anything while I'm out.\"</p>\n<p>\"Sure thing,\" says Isaac. When he hears the front door close he mutters, \"freaks,\" even though he knows Derek can still hear him.</p>\n<p>* * *</p>\n<p>Scott finds Stiles in the E.R. and settles into the chair next to his bed. \u201cYour dad came by to talk to Deaton about werewolves and Derek and you,\u201d he announces after a moment.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cGreat,\u201d sighs Stiles.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you want to know what they said?\u201d asks Scott.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNot really,\u201d says Stiles.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Scott glances up at him for a moment and then gets up and pushes Stiles over so that he can sit next to him on the bed.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re a lot cuddlier as a wolf,\u201d says Stiles irritably.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIs that a bad thing?\u201d asks Scott.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNo.\u201d Stiles still sounds annoyed, but he lets Scott put an arm around his shoulders and they lean back and stare at the ceiling together for a while.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t like it when you get kidnapped,\u201d says Scott.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou and me both, buddy.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles gets eight stitches, a wrist brace, a knee brace, and a lesson on how to turn properly to avoiding tearing his joints apart. It\u2019s condescending and he doesn\u2019t appreciate it, since his leg wasn\u2019t initially damaged by turning.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Scott drives him back to his house and on the way he says, \u201cDo you want to talk about it?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNot really,\u201d says Stiles. When they pull up to the house Stiles notices that the mailbox is slightly open so he limps over to close it and finds a giant envelope stuffed inside. There\u2019s no address on it, just his name scribbled across the front.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d asks Scott.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Stiles shrugs. \u201cCome on.\u201d</p>\n<p>Scott comes in with him and leans over his shoulder as Stiles opens the envelope and starts to pull out two pieces of paper.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s an application for friendship?\u201d asks Scott, and Stiles lets the papers drop back in.</p>\n<p>\u201cI think it\u2019s Derek attempting to apologize for being a dick,\u201d says Stiles.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWith a friendship application?\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles shrugs.\u00a0\"I sent him one first.\"</p>\n<p>Scott thinks about that for a moment and then says, \u201cAsking the Argents for help finding you was his idea.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles\u2019 eyes widen with surprise before he smiles and ducks his head.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Scott sighs. \u201cFor the record, I think this is a terrible idea.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about,\u201d says Stiles.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy do you only have crushes on people who are mean to you?\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles winces. \u201cDon\u2019t call it a crush. One does not simply crush on Derek Hale.\u201d</p>\n<p>Scott throws him a worried glance. \u201cThen what-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d says Stiles. \u201cHe\u2019s just not crush material. He\u2019s-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFriendship application material?\u201d asks Scott. He looks deeply uncomfortable but Stiles appreciates that he\u2019s making an effort.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHe did just save my life. I like that in a person.\u201d Scott raises an eyebrow and Stiles shrugs. \u201cIt\u2019s a <em>friendship</em> application, dude. You can calm down.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUh-huh,\u201d says Scott. \u201cIf he gets out of line you let me know.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou are <em>not</em> about to give me a bad-touch speech.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m <em>just</em> saying, if-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d says Stiles, \u201cI\u2019m going to take a shower and when I get back we will be on a brand new topic of conversation.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>He picks himself up off the couch and makes it to the hallway before Scott calls after him, \u201cIf he hurts you, I\u2019ll kill him.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s not very heroic,\u201d says Stiles, and Scott just shrugs. Stiles rolls his eyes but he smiles as he starts to make his way up the stairs.\u00a0</p>\n<p>* * *</p>\n<p>The best thing about his dad knowing about werewolves is that Stiles doesn\u2019t have to come up with any dumb stories about what happened to him. The worst thing about his dad knowing about werewolves is that when he finally bursts into the house an hour later, having worked to clean up the mess left by the Argents and the alphas (neither of whom sustained much in the way of casualties, though there was a great deal of blood and quite a ruckus), Stiles can\u2019t pretend that his life wasn\u2019t in danger. There\u2019s nothing he can say to wipe the look of fear and worry and anger off his dad\u2019s face.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Scott excuses himself with a promise that he\u2019ll see Stiles later and Stiles sits on the couch with his dad pacing in front of him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHow could you have kept this from me?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI already told you, you can\u2019t arrest-\u201d</p>\n<p>His dad waves that excuse away and snaps, \u201cYou don\u2019t get to decide what I should and should not know, Stiles, not when it comes to things like this. You\u2019re seventeen! You-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d snaps Stiles, \u201cI <em>am</em> seventeen, and what am I supposed to do if something happens to you? Something that never would have happened if I could have just kept my mouth shut? I\u2019m not going to be responsible for that, not for you too.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat do you mean <em>too</em>?\u201d demands his dad.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Stiles swallows, leans back and looks away. His dad walks around the coffee table and sits down on the couch, but he doesn't say anything at first and they don't look at each other.</p>\n<p>Finally, his dad takes a deep breath and Stiles tenses, steeling himself for any of a hundred different accusatory or disappointed things he expects to hear, but all his dad says is, \u201cYour mom had cancer.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles\u2019 head jerks back around to find his dad watching him intently. \u201cI know.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s not a single thing you could have said or done - or <em>not</em> said, or not done - that would have changed what happened to her.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles opens his mouth and then closes it, swallows, blows out a tense breath and says, \u201cI know. I just - I feel like I made it harder, sometimes. I don\u2019t - you just broke up a hunter-werewolf battle royale, don\u2019t you have more important-\u201d that earns him a slap to the back of the head and Stiles manages to look offended for a moment before his dad leans over and hugs him.</p>\n<p>\u201cThere is <em>nothing</em> more important to me than you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles\u2019 throat closes up before he can say anything, so he just hugs back.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s not until much later that he finds himself alone in his room and he finally pulls out Derek\u2019s application again.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The first page starts off with the predictable but depressing, <em>Relative to Hale Family (1989-2004), </em>but the next line makes Stiles\u2019 breath catch. <em>Patsy to Kate Argent (2004). </em>The list of duties beneath it are more or less a long list of slurs against Derek\u2019s character and intelligence, and after that it says <em>Brother to Laura Hale (1989-2010) </em>and <em>??? to Scott McCall (2010-Present). </em>The skills section is even more sparse than Stiles\u2019 had been and the \u2018letter of recommendation\u2019 is a quote from Peter that says, \u201cHe\u2019s my favorite person who\u2019s ever ripped my throat out.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles digs up some white-out and paints over the Kate Argent section. When it dries, he writes <em>Confidential, redacted</em> on top and stows the application away in his desk.</p>\n<p>Stiles sleeps through most of the next two days but when Scott calls him on Saturday and invites him over to watch movies with Isaac, Stiles finally drags himself out of bed and manages to shower and make himself presentable. Erica and Isaac are in the living room when he and Scott get there and when Stiles asks about Derek they both point vaguely upward in the direction of Derek\u2019s room.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Stiles eyes the stairs with distaste for a moment before sighing and starting to climb them. He finds Derek reading on his bed, which is essentially a stack of mattresses with blankets piled on top, and Derek thoroughly ignores him. Stiles leans against the doorway and glances around the room, which looks oddly welcoming. It\u2019s less burnt than the rest of the house and the huge window that takes up most of the outside wall allows plenty of wintery sunlight to fall over the stacks of books and piles of clothing scattered around the floor.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay,\u201d says Stiles.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Derek\u2019s hands tighten on the book but he doesn\u2019t respond.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Stiles rolls his eyes. \u201cAs I understand it there\u2019s supposed to be some sort of interview process but I have it on good authority that it\u2019ll go well.\u201d He pulls a little plastic ball out of his pocket and says, \u201cHappy Christmas, by the way,\u201d before tossing it. Derek catches it by reflex and turns it over in his hand as Stiles continues, \u201cI won it. I mean it came out of one of those claw machine things in the mall but those are mostly a rip-off so whenever I get anything, it feels like winning.\u201d</p>\n<p>The ball contains a crappy metal ring with a wolf\u2019s head on it, and Stiles is sure that there are probably very few possessions that Derek has desired less in his lifetime, but that\u2019s the trouble with getting Christmas presents for people when you don\u2019t want them to know that you care. The present isn\u2019t so much the ring as it is the fact that Stiles was thinking of Derek when he wasn\u2019t around, but he\u2019s not willing to explain that so he shoves his hands in his pockets and says, \u201cSo I hear the alphas all got out more or less in tact.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d says Derek. He pops the plastic ball open to get a closer look at the ring. \u201cI\u2019m beginning to think that Kate was the only member of that family who was actually any good at hunting werewolves.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles\u2019 eyebrows shoot up. \u201cAre we joking about that now?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPeter is,\u201d says Derek, setting the ring on his bedside table.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSorry. It must suck having him around all the time.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt sucks marginally less than murdering him did.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles nods. \u201cWell, Scott and I brought movies if you want to-\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek looks back down at his book and says, \u201cCan you just stay here and talk about something?\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles opens his mouth to say something - <em>yes</em> or <em>why</em> or maybe <em>who are you and what have you done with Derek Hale</em>, but nothing comes out.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIt was really quiet when you were missing. Like it was when I first came back and I\u2019d just like it to not be quiet for a while without having to be around anyone.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles smirks and says, \u201cI don\u2019t count as someone?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re safe,\u201d grunts Derek, and it sounds like an insult or an accusation.</p>\n<p>Stiles is fine with that. He kicks off his shoes and sits down on the corner of Derek\u2019s bed, folding his legs beneath him before launching into the story of how he convinced Scott once when they were little that Melissa probably hated her blue scrubs and would be much happier if they were tie-dyed.</p>\n<p>As it turned out, Stiles was mistaken.\u00a0</p>\n<p>* * *</p>\n<p>The alphas quiet down a little following the showdown with the hunters. The pack doesn\u2019t exactly relax - they still make sure no one goes anywhere alone and they\u2019re all a bit jumpy in public - but the atmosphere when they\u2019re together seems lighter. They spend New Years watching the Beacon Hills fireworks display from the edge of the woods. Scott\u2019s mom and Stiles\u2019 dad supply coolers so they can bring soda and Erica, Isaac, and Boyd play with bottle rockets while Scott slinks off to look for Allison.</p>\n<p>Stiles was only permitted to come along on the condition that he stay off his knee as much as possible so he plants himself on a tree stump and watches the others rough-house while trying to keep an eye on his dad and Melissa through the trees.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Derek drops down to sit on the ground beside him and leans over to see where he\u2019s looking. \u201cThey\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHuh? Oh. Yeah. I know, I just - does it look like they\u2019re sitting a little close to one another?\u201d Stiles tries to ignore the fact that his shoulder brushes against Derek\u2019s as he shifts to try and get a better view while he\u2019s talking.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDoes it matter?\u201d asks Derek.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, yes. Do you know how cool it would be if Scott and I were legally brothers? Like, lived in the same house and had bunk beds brothers?\u201d asks Stiles.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAren\u2019t you a little old for bunk beds?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous, bunk beds are ageless masterpieces of leisure furniture.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek snorts at that.</p>\n<p>Eventually the fireworks start and Scott slinks back out of the woods. He doesn\u2019t look overjoyed, so Stiles assumes his mission to find and win back Allison didn\u2019t go well, but he doesn\u2019t look sad either so at least it wasn\u2019t a disaster. He glances at Stiles and Derek and narrows his eyes for a moment before giving Stiles a pointed look.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou remember what I said?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPlease leave,\u201d says Stiles.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay, but you-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI remember, thank you, go make sure your wacky pals don\u2019t set each other on fire.\u201d</p>\n<p>Scott keeps glaring until Stiles shoos him and he finally trudges away to join the other betas.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat did he-\u201d begins Derek but Stiles shushes him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThe sky\u2019s exploding, I don\u2019t want to talk about Scott.\u201d</p>\n<p>The last and biggest firework launches at midnight (or 12:03, according to some phones, but who\u2019s counting?) and as the pieces fizzle down and Erica and Boyd wrap around each other, Stiles leans down in a fit of insanity and kisses Derek\u2019s cheek.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Derek glares, and there\u2019s something so marvelously <em>Derek</em> about glaring over a kiss on New Years that Stiles suddenly finds that he can\u2019t wipe the big stupid grin off his face.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s harassment, Stilinski.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles laughs. \u201cYou going to report me, Hale?\u201d When he doesn\u2019t get an answer he looks down to find Derek staring at him, only he\u2019s not glaring anymore.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d he says.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Stiles tries to do a quick calculation of exactly how grounded he\u2019ll be if his dad catches him making out with Derek Hale, and then he hears Scott say, \u201cSo, Sheriff, how\u2019s it going at the station? Are you fully restaffed yet?\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles thanks god for best friends. \u201cOn a scale of growling to evisceration, how-\u201d he begins, but before he can finish the question Derek kisses him. He tastes like diet cola and his stubble scratches Stiles\u2019 chin and Stiles wonders if all tongues are that soft or if Derek\u2019s is special. Derek\u2019s hand slides up, fingers curling around the back of Stiles\u2019 neck and Stiles reaches over to slide his hands up to cup Derek\u2019s jaw and he\u2019s pretty sure it\u2019s the greatest kiss of all time until he over-balances and falls off the stump into Derek\u2019s lap with a yelp.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cStiles?\u201d calls the Sheriff.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cFine,\u201d says Stiles quickly. He disentangles himself from Derek and they sit across from each other on the ground, faces flushed and slightly out of breath even though neither of them had done anything particularly taxing. Derek looks guilty and seems to be getting guiltier by the second and he opens his mouth but Stiles holds up a hand and says, \u201cShut up.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek opens his mouth again and Stiles throws a stick at him. \u201c<em>Shut up,</em>\u201d he repeats. \u201cHere\u2019s how this is going to go. I\u2019m going to say Happy New Year, and you\u2019re going to say Happy New Year back, and we\u2019re going to go and hang out with our friends, and you\u2019re not going to apologize because that was awesome and you don\u2019t get to be a dumbass and ruin it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Derek manages to look impressed, offended and amused all at once.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Stiles picks himself up so that all of his weight is resting on his good knee and leans over slowly, giving Derek plenty of time to dodge before Stiles bumps their foreheads together. \u201cHappy New Year, idiot.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHappy New Year, jackass,\u201d says Derek.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Stiles kisses Derek\u2019s temple and Derek helps him to his feet and they make their way over to where Scott is employing increasingly embarrassing efforts to distract the Sheriff while Melissa and the betas look on with a mixture of pity and amusement.\u00a0</p>\n<p>When they\u2019re walking back to the cars later, Scott hisses, \u201cYou owe me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stiles laughs. \u201cThanks buddy. I mean it, from the bottom of my heart. I\u2019m thinking about getting your face tattooed on my ass to show my appreciation.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGross,\u201d says Scott.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re right, we should just get matching BFF tattoos.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI hate you,\u201d says Scott.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI love you too,\u201d says Stiles. They\u2019re quiet for a few minutes, surrounded by the soft voices of the rest of the pack and the chirping of bugs and the scurrying of little animals and the gentle whisper of wind as it rushes through leaves. Beacon Hills still isn\u2019t safe - hasn\u2019t been for a long while and probably won\u2019t be for a long while yet - but Stiles can\u2019t think of any place he\u2019d rather be. \u201cHey Scott?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI think I aced my interview.\u201d</p>\n<p>Scott pushes him over and claims that he tripped on a root.</p>"
