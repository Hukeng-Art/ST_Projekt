  "summary": "<p>And Taehyung thinks he\u2019s never loved anyone more in his life than the boy above him who\u2019s a little bit rough and sometimes a bit insensitive and maybe a little bit mean, but he\u2019s also so soft and so gentle, and he treats Taehyung like he\u2019s something so precious to him. And maybe he\u2019s like that because of Taehyung, or maybe it\u2019s because underneath everything, underneath the tough exterior and the sky-high walls, his heart\u2019s more delicate than Taehyung\u2019s, but all Taehyung knows is that Jeongguk fills up all of Taehyung's vulnerable pieces with parts of himself.</p>",

  "text": "<p>i.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The first time Taehyung really notices it, Jeongguk has him pressed down on the obnoxious orange couch in their living room that Taehyung found on a recycle Facebook page and fell in love with at first sight.</p>\n<p>Jeongguk has one hand up his shirt, stroking the soft skin just under Taehyung\u2019s ribs, as his tongue delves between Taehyung\u2019s lips, and it\u2019s unhurried and gentle and tender, Jeongguk a heavy warmth against the chill of the heavy rain and dark clouds outside.</p>\n<p>And Taehyung loves it, but he\u2019d probably be enjoying it more if his grip on Jeongguk\u2019s shoulders wasn\u2019t mostly due to half his body slowly sliding off the couch. The pillows, iron man blanket, and giant lion plushy he\u2019d been sleeping with half an hour ago take up too much room, and Taehyung\u2019s halfway off the couch before he realizes it, his upper body suddenly dropping off the cushions, and he yelps in surprise, hands fisting in Jeongguk\u2019s shirt in an attempt to catch himself, eyes squeezing shut.</p>\n<p>But he never reaches the ground, because Jeongguk\u2019s arm catches him, tight and secure around his waist, and the stronger boy easily hauls Taehyung back up onto the couch \u2013 which Taehyung doesn\u2019t help with at all, he\u2019s mostly dead weight in his surprise \u2013 and Jeongguk resettles Taehyung into his lap, strong hands keeping a firm but gentle grip on Taehyung\u2019s hips, and teeth immediately sinking back into the warm skin of Taehyung\u2019s neck.</p>\n<p>And Taehyung, who\u2019d been the one to initiate the slow and relaxed and unhurried pace, who'd been teasing Jeongguk's patience, is suddenly ten degrees hotter and ten times needier about getting Jeongguk's hand down his pants. The rush of heat is so sudden that he\u2019s positive his face is bright red, and he can feel the almost painful press of his dick against his jeans. He bites down his lower lip, knows he\u2019s about to moan, and from what? From being picked up? Taehyung\u2019s got more pride than that, except he\u2019s suddenly very aware of the flex of Jeongguk\u2019s shoulders and biceps under Taehyung\u2019s fingers, and the curl of Jeongguk\u2019s rougher hands on his hips and Taehyung lets out a half whimper half moan, something so erotic and obscene that Jeongguk pauses and leans back to get a good look at the smaller boy. And Taehyung might\u2019ve been more embarrassed about it if he wasn\u2019t so turned on by this point, and before Jeongguk can voice his confusion, Taehyung grinds down onto thicker thighs, delights in the way Jeongguk throws his head back and tightens his grip on Taehyung\u2019s waist, loves the press of each finger into his skin, one hand sliding down to get a firmer grip on his ass.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Jeongguk.</em>\u201d It\u2019s barely spoken, a mix between a moan and a whimper and a plea, and Taehyung\u2019s stuck somewhere hazy and hot and heavenly. His shirt\u2019s been tossed somewhere behind him, and Jeongguk\u2019s other hand is sliding up to thumb over Taehyung\u2019s nipple.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Jeongguk says, voice raspy and rough, and he presses a quick kiss to Taehyung\u2019s swollen lips. \u201cYeah, okay.\u201d</p>\n<p>He stands then, hands warm and sure in their grip on Taehyung\u2019s thighs, and this time, the shift doesn\u2019t make Taehyung yelp in surprise. It does make him even hotter though, enough for Taehyung's toes to feel tingly, and he wraps one hand around the muscles of Jeongguk's arm, wants to feel the flex of strength just under the skin.</p>\n<p>Jeongguk bumps into a few walls on his way to the bedroom, distracted by Taehyung\u2019s pleading whimpers and the slight thrusts against Jeongguk\u2019s solid form, but his hand cups the back of Taehyung\u2019s head before it can hit the wall, gentle and reassuring and protective despite the roughness of Jeongguk slamming him back to grind up against him.</p>\n<p>Taehyung whines again, barely holding himself back from rutting up against Jeongguk\u2019s steady form as Jeongguk carries him to their bedroom, so he settles for pressing kisses onto Jeongguk\u2019s cheek and ear, not holding back the breathy moans because of the knowledge, the sudden realization, that Jeongguk is much\u00a0<em>much</em>\u00a0stronger than him.</p>\n<p>And Taehyung really,\u00a0<em>really</em>\u00a0likes that.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>ii.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>They\u2019re walking back from Hoseok and Seokjin\u2019s place when Taehyung sees the top of a Ferris wheel from a few streets over, and immediately begs Jeongguk to go.</p>\n<p>\u201cPlease please\u00a0<em>please</em>,\u201d he wheedles, tugging on Jeongguk\u2019s arm before latching himself to his boyfriend\u2019s side. \u201cI never ask for anything!\u201d</p>\n<p>That\u2019s a lie, because Taehyung\u2019s the type to ask Jeongguk to bring him back a souvenir when Jeongguk goes grocery shopping.</p>\n<p>Jeongguk glances between Taehyung\u2019s puppy dog eyes and the red flag at the top of the Ferris wheel before sighing heavily \u2013 even though Taehyung knows that the quirk in his eyebrows means that Taehyung\u2019s done something cute and Jeongguk wants to indulge him. He lets Taehyung tangle their fingers together and drag him up and down five different streets before Jeongguk actually googles the fair on his phone and leads Taehyung down one street and to the entrance with a fond smile, never once letting go of Taehyung\u2019s hand.</p>\n<p>The fair itself is really fun, like the ones Taehyung remembers from his childhood. He plays the fishing game and the ring toss game and he wins an iron man stuffed figure that Jeongguk was eyeing at the milk bottle game.</p>\n<p>They don\u2019t go on any of the roller coasters because even though Taehyung loves the rush of adrenaline, Jeongguk doesn\u2019t, a mix of fear of heights and hating the twisting feeling of free fall in his stomach. And by this point in their relationship, it\u2019s routine to skip over the roller coasters.</p>\n<p>(They\u2019d gone through the awkward stage where Jeongguk tried to go on the rides but felt sick afterwards, and when Taehyung tried to go alone but it was no fun to be by himself, and when Jeongguk apologized every time they\u2019d pass a roller coaster, but now \u2013 it\u2019s comfortable. It\u2019s a compromise.)</p>\n<p>Of all the rides, the Ferris wheel has always been Taehyung\u2019s favourite, so Jeongguk sucks up his nerve to join his excited boyfriend. He\u2019s not too scared about it any more, not after how many Ferris wheels he\u2019s been on, but it still takes him a few seconds to get used to the shakiness of the compartment.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis is great!!\u201d Taehyung exclaims, cheering as they\u2019re moved upwards, and when they stop somewhere near the top, he turns to tuck himself against Jeongguk. \u201cYou doing okay?\u201d he murmurs, petting Jeongguk\u2019s hair as if soothing a spooked puppy.</p>\n<p>(It\u00a0<em>is</em>\u00a0really comforting, though.)</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Jeongguk says, and there isn\u2019t any tension in his voice, so Taehyung knows Jeongguk\u2019s not lying to make him\u00a0feel better. \u201cI\u2019m glad we came.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMe too!\u201d Taehyung grins up at him, cheeks turning pink in delight when Jeongguk curls both arms around his smaller form so Taehyung can cuddle into his chest.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe Ferris wheel is my favourite,\u201d Taehyung tells him, drawing hearts on Jeongguk\u2019s jean-clad thigh.</p>\n<p>\u201cI know,\u201d Jeongguk murmurs.</p>\n<p>\u201cI love you,\u201d Taehyung says.</p>\n<p>He can feel Jeongguk\u2019s lips curl into a smile against his temple. \u201cI know.\u201d</p>\n<p>Taehyung gets a stomach ache from eating too much cotton candy at the fair, and Jeongguk, who\u2019d given him disapproving glances and stared Taehyung down with an\u00a0<em>I-told-you-so</em>\u00a0look, rubs Taehyung\u2019s tummy as the smaller boy whines about it.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you stop me?\u201d Taehyung complains.</p>\n<p>\u201cI tried,\u201d Jeongguk reminds him. \u201cYou know you always crash hard from a sugar high.\u201d</p>\n<p>He knows, and he does, because his emotions feel all out of whack and his stomach hurts. He glares down at it. \u201cI hate my tummy.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t,\u201d Jeongguk smiles a little crookedly, like he\u2019s joking but also being totally honest. \u201cI love your tummy.\u201d</p>\n<p>Taehyung has nothing to say to that, ears turning red, because his tummy is soft and a little pudgy from his love of sugar and it\u2019s nothing like Jeongguk\u2019s strong abdomen, but Taehyung feels immense love for his soft tummy in that moment, for making Jeongguk smile so affectionately.</p>\n<p>\u201cIf you love my tummy,\u201d Taehyung says, moving over to Jeongguk so he can snake his arms around Jeongguk\u2019s shoulders and rest his chin on the firm shoulder. \u201cThen please help it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Jeongguk laughs, so warm and solid and secure beneath Taehyung\u2019s hands. \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCarry me and my tummy home?\u201d Taehyung pleads.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, okay,\u201d Jeongguk agrees easily, laughter fond and something else, maybe something loving, and he turns so that Taehyung can clamber onto his back. And Taehyung\u2019s not light or small by any means, but he\u2019s smaller than Jeongguk which means he can reap the benefits of having a stronger boyfriend.</p>\n<p>He still feels a little bit guilty though. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he mumbles sleepily into Jeongguk\u2019s shoulder. The sun is setting and the crash from the sugar high is making him feel tired. Jeongguk hasn\u2019t stopped walking, and hasn\u2019t complained either.</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t be,\u201d Jeongguk reassures him, hiking Taehyung up a little higher, and Taehyung feels his stomach flip flop in a way that has more to do with how full his heart feels and less to do with Jeongguk\u2019s rocking movement.</p>\n<p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Taehyung makes sure to say, because at the end of the day, no matter how many times Jeongguk carries him when he\u2019s sick or picks him up when he falls or saves him from a bad situation, it\u2019s not something Taehyung can ever be ungrateful for.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s so, so thankful, every day, even after four years, that he has Jeongguk in his life. That Jeongguk let him in when he was shutting everybody else out. It\u2019s a position in Jeongguk\u2019s life that Taehyung won\u2019t ever give up, that he\u2019d fight to keep, that he\u2019d protect with his whole entire being.</p>\n<p>\u201cI love you,\u201d Jeongguk reminds him softly, nudging the side of Taehyung\u2019s sleep-heavy head with his chin. \u201cGo to sleep. I can still carry you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>iii.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The second time he notices it, Taehyung\u2019s hiding from his boyfriend because he didn\u2019t\u00a0<em>mean</em>\u00a0to splatter gold paint all over Jeongguk\u2019s notes for a case study for his law class, and Jeongguk\u00a0<em>had</em>\u00a0said all the paper in the bin next to his desk were waste, but Taehyung couldn\u2019t\u00a0<em>really</em>\u00a0be expected to tell the difference when he saw the notes just beside the bin. They all looked the same to Taehyung \u2013 useless.</p>\n<p>So he\u2019s crouched behind the sofa, in the small space between the back of the neon orange fabric and the cream-coloured wall, both hands plastered over his mouth to quiet his giggles as Jeongguk\u2019s footsteps fade down one of the hallways. He peeks his head around the side of the couch, and the room is empty, still, and quiet. He knows Jeongguk\u2019s not as mad as he could be (and Jeongguk\u2019s made the habit of always making two copies of his notes ever since he met Taehyung), but he still jumps in shock when Jeongguk\u2019s suddenly above him, hands reaching for Taehyung.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Found you</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>Taehyung scrambles away, hands trying to push away Jeongguk\u2019s persistent ones, laughter falling from his lips. Jeongguk follows, shoving the couch to one side and leaving Taehyung trapped where the couch meets the wall and forms a \u2018V\u2019.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou really thought I wouldn\u2019t find you?\u201d Jeongguk asks, and Taehyung tries to squirm out of Jeongguk\u2019s hands, but Jeongguk\u2019s grip is strong, and he easily picks Taehyung up and slings him over one shoulder, butt pointed to the sky.</p>\n<p>And Taehyung freezes, hands limply gripping the back of Jeongguk\u2019s shirt, because \u2013\u00a0<em>oh.</em></p>\n<p>He presses his face into Jeongguk\u2019s lower back and tries to will away any sign of arousal before it\u2019s apparent, because the first time this happened, it was okay, it was part of the\u00a0<em>mood</em>, but this, now \u2013 it\u2019s embarrassing.</p>\n<p>Jeongguk\u2019s not even out of breath when he plops Taehyung down onto their bed, lips curled into a smirk, but it dissolves into a look of confusion when he takes in Taehyung\u2019s flushed cheeks and otherwise motionless form aside from his heaving chest.</p>\n<p>Jeongguk frowns. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p>\n<p>Jeongguk\u2019s voice, his innocent bewilderment, is what draws Taehyung back from where his dick is begging him to go, and he blinks up at his boyfriend before launching himself upwards and forwards off the bed in attempt to tackle Jeongguk, fully expecting Jeongguk to catch him.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019ll never take me alive!\u201d he yells.</p>\n<p>The thing is though, the thing he\u2019s always known, and just recently come to realize, is that Jeongguk\u2019s going to catch him. Jeongguk\u2019s always going to catch him. Jeongguk\u2019s hands would be there before he even starts to fall.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>iv.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Taehyung\u2019s not embarrassed to admit that he\u2019s a lightweight.</p>\n<p>Alcohol, coffee, even caffeinated tea, affect him stronger, and faster, than any of his friends. He even has to buy the kid\u2019s medicine at the drug store because when he took the adult one he was knocked out for the whole night and half the next day.</p>\n<p>(Jeongguk, after calming down from his panic and being reassured that nothing was wrong, had laughed for\u00a0<em>days</em>.)</p>\n<p>(But the kid\u2019s medicine tastes way better anyway, so Taehyung thinks he\u2019s the real winner here.)</p>\n<p>But the thing about alcohol, unlike caffeine or medicine, is that it makes Taehyung extra outgoing. Extra friendly. Extra boisterous.</p>\n<p>And sometimes, that friendliness comes across as flirting.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s nothing Taehyung intends, and it\u2019s never how he means for it to be, and Jeongguk knows it too, knows Taehyung\u2019s level of curiosity and his disregard for personal space is sometimes interpreted to be something it\u2019s not. And Jeongguk would never stop Taehyung from drinking, he\u2019d never set rules for Taehyung like that, but he does make sure to pay extra attention to Taehyung when they go out to Seokjin and Hoseok\u2019s house party.</p>\n<p>So when Seokjin makes his way to Jeongguk with an armful of water bottles, an exasperated look on his face, and says, \u201cI think you should check on Taehyung\u201d, Jeongguk doesn\u2019t hesitate to look for his boyfriend (who\u2019s wearing a black mesh shirt and a pair of black leather pants that look like they\u2019re painted on, and Jeongguk had a really hard time letting Taehyung out of the apartment because of how good he looked).</p>\n<p>(There\u00a0<em>is</em>\u00a0a bright red mark on Taehyung\u2019s neck though. Just above the collar of the shirt where everyone can see.)</p>\n<p>He finds Taehyung talking animatedly with another guy. The boy is shorter than Taehyung, milky-skinned and blond-haired, but it\u2019s not the boy that\u00a0made Seokjin come to find him. It\u2019s the tall \u2013 taller than Jeongguk \u2013 darker-skinned boy just behind the shorter one, jaw clenched and eyes narrowed in\u00a0annoyance as he looks between Taehyung and the blond boy, and Jeongguk knows if he doesn\u2019t step in soon that the situation could get a lot worse.</p>\n<p>(It\u2019s happened before.)</p>\n<p>\u201cHey,\u201d Jeongguk says, and he slides an arm around Taehyung\u2019s waist, settles his hand low on Taehyung\u2019s hips.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey!\u201d Taehyung smiles brightly back at him, lips stained red and rosy-cheeked. \u201cYou found me!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, I found you,\u201d Jeongguk smiles indulgently. He hands Taehyung the half-filled water bottle he\u2019s carrying. \u201cYou know how sick you feel when you drink too much,\u201d he reminds the slighter boy, and Taehyung nods in agreement, happiness and contentment rolling off him in waves.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh!\u201d Taehyung says quickly, turning back to the smaller boy, excitement in his voice. \u201cThis is Yoongi! He\u2019s also from Daegu!! And his boyfriend Namjoon. They just moved in across the hall!\u201d He pats Jeongguk\u2019s firm chest. \u201cThis is Jeongguk, my boyfriend.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNice to meet you,\u201d Jeongguk smiles at Yoongi, and the boy behind him, whose jaw is unclenching and shoulders relaxing.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u00a0<em>told</em>\u00a0you,\u201d Seokjin grumbles when he finds the four of them later, and Namjoon looks a little embarrassed. \u201cI told you he has a boyfriend. Stop thinking every guy Yoongi talks to his hitting on him.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHuh?\u201d Yoongi says at the same time as Taehyung\u2019s \u201cwhat?\u201d</p>\n<p>And then Yoongi sighs and rolls his eyes. \u201cKim Namjoon, I swear to god\u2026I thought you said we were supposed to make friends tonight?\u201d</p>\n<p>Namjoon splutters for a few second in protest.\u00a0\u201cI just \u2013 you\u2019re\u00a0<em>cute</em>. I\u2019m always going to think people are hitting on you!\u201d</p>\n<p>Yoongi scoffs but his ears are pink and he leans a bit further into the taller boy. \u201cSo dumb,\u201d he says, and maybe he wanted it to be mean but the small smile and the way he curls his smaller fingers around Namjoon\u2019s bigger ones makes it more affectionate. \u201cI bet Taehyung\u2019s boyfriend doesn\u2019t think that every guy who talks to him is flirting with him.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jeongguk tries to keep his face as blank as possible, but Yoongi catches\u00a0<em>something</em>. \u201cOh, you\u2019ve got to be kidding me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Taehyung turns to look back at Jeongguk. \u201c<em>Really?</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Jeongguk denies immediately.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s such a liar,\u201d Yoongi says, and Jeongguk doesn\u2019t even deny it because Taehyung has a pleased curl to his lips when he looks coyly up at Jeongguk, and Jeongguk starts to realize that maybe Taehyung always knew about Jeongguk\u2019s jealous side. And maybe Taehyung likes to test the limits of it, just to see what Jeongguk will do.</p>\n<p>So he drops his gaze to the glimpses of golden skin he can see through the mesh of Taehyung\u2019s shirt, dragging his gaze down to the way the leather pants hug Taehyung\u2019s long legs, staring maybe a bit too long at the slope of Taehyung\u2019s hips down to his inner thigh, and when Jeongguk\u2019s eyes flicker back up, Taehyung\u2019s no longer wearing a smug expression. If anything, he\u2019s starting to look a little needy, and Taehyung\u2019s biting down on his lower lip like he does when he\u2019s starting to get a little bit desperate.</p>\n<p>So Jeongguk turns his gaze back to Yoongi and Namjoon and Seokjin, pretending to ignore the way Taehyung lets out the barest hint of a breathy whine against his neck when he presses into Jeongguk\u2019s side.</p>\n<p>Jeongguk smirks.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s the\u00a0<em>only</em>\u00a0one who can make Taehyung like this, can make Taehyung this desperate without even touching him, and maybe Jeongguk does it often enough that it\u2019s a little bit mean, but he always makes sure to get Taehyung off in the end.</p>\n<p>But to Jeongguk \u2013 it\u2019s like a reassurance to Jeongguk, seeing physical proof of just how deeply he can affect Taehyung, of just how much trust Taehyung places in his hands.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>v.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Taehyung has this one bracelet, thin brown leather wrapped intricately around a delicate silver pendant, that he wears every day.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s almost a part of Taehyung now, and Jeongguk wouldn\u2019t care about it, except that the bracelet was given to him by his ex-boyfriend. The one before Jeongguk. The one who moved to Australia, which was the only reason for their break up, and when Jeongguk and Taehyung started dating, when they\u2019d go out to cafes and restaurants, the waiters would always ask where\u00a0<em>Minjun</em>\u00a0was.</p>\n<p>So when Taehyung doesn\u2019t bother to mention that Minjun is back in town, that Minjun is the person he met up with for dinner, and Jeongguk has to find all this out when Jimin asks about it, he\u2019s not happy. At all.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s stands at the kitchen counter silently, and Hoseok, who\u2019s rummaging through the fridge, finally pokes his head out, brows furrowed in confusion at Jeongguk who\u2019s stopped making any noise, but all Jeongguk\u2019s forced to listen to is Taehyung\u2019s excited laughter about seeing Minjun again.</p>\n<p>And maybe Hoseok sort of starts to get it, because he glances out the doorway into the living room, where Jimin and Taehyung are, and then back to Jeongguk\u2019s still form, robotically pouring a bag of chips into a bowl. \u201cDid you not know?\u201d He asks, tone slightly clueless.</p>\n<p>Jeongguk pauses his movements for a second, and then sets the empty bag back down, and picks up the bowl without answering Hoseok. He doesn\u2019t think he can.</p>\n<p>Taehyung\u2019s still talking about Minjun when Jeongguk walks out into the living room and places the bowl of chips down on the coffee table. Both Jimin and Taehyung immediately dive for it, the soju bottle on the table mostly empty, and he tries to ignore the rushing in his ears and the way his stomach clenches when Taehyung says, \u201c<em>We went to this fancy restaurant, and he knew the guy who owns it! I got to try really fancy wine and they gave us this super good chocolate cake for dessert but we had to share because it was so big!</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWow,\u201d Jimin says, face a litte flushed from the alcohol. He glances up at Jeongguk, who moves to walk back to the kitchen because he doesn\u2019t want to be forced to listen to this. \u201cI haven\u2019t heard about Minjun in a long time. I\u2019m surprised Jeongguk was okay with you seeing him.\u201d</p>\n<p>Except Jeongguk\u2019s <em>not</em>, and he hadn\u2019t even <em>known</em>.</p>\n<p>\u201cAh,\u201d Taehyung says dismissively, uncoordinated hands betraying his tipsiness. \u201cJeonggukie doesn\u2019t care!\u201d</p>\n<p>And Jeongguk tries \u2013 he really does try \u2013 to ignore it, but he <em>can\u2019t</em>. \u201c\u2026I do care.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jeongguk says it so quietly that Taehyung almost misses it. Taehyung lets out a snort of drunk laughter.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo you don\u2019t!\u201d Taehyung\u2019s still laughing, like it\u2019s funny, like Jeongguk doesn\u2019t feel as if every word about Minjun is like he's\u00a0listening to nails on a chalkboard. \u201cYou didn\u2019t say it bothered you before I had dinner with him!\u201d</p>\n<p>Jeongguk takes a deep breath, because this is <em>Taehyung</em>, <em>drunk</em> Taehyung, but he can\u2019t stop the swirl of annoyance and irritation itching beneath his skin. And there\u2019s a feeling of betrayal too, so small but so powerful, the whisper of it like a jeering voice in the back of his head.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou never told me,\u201d Jeongguk says, so coldly, so unable to reign in the sliver of frostiness in his voice, that the smile slips off Jimin\u2019s face and he suddenly starts to look very, very uncomfortable, stuck between Jeongguk\u2019s still form near the entrance to the kitchen and Taehyung next to him on the couch.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d Taehyung says, uncaringly, giggly. \u201cOops.\u201d</p>\n<p>It\u2019s silent for a moment, broken only by Taehyung\u2019s breathless laughter, and he\u2019s drunk, and it\u2019s probably why he can\u2019t tell that something\u2019s wrong, that Jimin\u2019s soft, \u201c<em>Taehyung\u2026</em>\u201d, and Jeongguk\u2019s clenched jaw are worth paying attention to.</p>\n<p>Jimin looks as if it\u2019s painful to be sitting in between them, but Jeongguk\u2019s glad for Jimin, because right now, he doesn\u2019t want Taehyung anywhere <em>near</em> him.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Taehyung asks. \u201cJeongguk\u2019s not <em>mad</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>The way he scoffs it, like Jeongguk has no right to be upset about Taehyung practically going on a date with his ex-boyfriend, make indignant walls slam up inside Jeongguk, and suddenly he\u2019s more than mad. He\u2019s almost furious.</p>\n<p>And then Taehyung\u2019s reaching out for him, because alcohol always makes him extra clingy, but Jeongguk\u2019s <em>not</em> having it, especially not when he can still see Minjun\u2019s bracelet on Taehyung\u2019s wrist, branding Taehyung as if Taehyung could never fully belong to Jeongguk. And that\u2019s the core of it, really, of Jeongguk\u2019s rawest fears. That Taehyung would up and leave him one day, that Jeongguk would be left behind with only the ugliest parts of himself, that Taehyung, who\u2019d taken the time to pick out every good thing about Jeongguk, would decide that Jeongguk wasn\u2019t worth it, that he could do better, that Jeongguk could never treat him gentle enough.</p>\n<p>Taehyung\u2019s hand wraps around his wrist and Jeongguk immediately tenses up, face hardening and eyes shuttering closed, body unyielding to Taehyung\u2019s tug on his arm, and he shrugs Taehyung\u2019s hand off, a kind of roughness in his movements that\u2019s unfamiliar to Taehyung. Taehyung, for a split second, looks shocked.</p>\n<p>Jimin gets up and disappears into the kitchen at some point, grabbing Hoseok and fleeing the apartment, but Jeongguk barely notices, not when it feels like there\u2019s something hard and heavy on his chest, making it difficult to breathe.</p>\n<p>Taehyung looks up at him in askance and confusion, maybe getting it finally, that something\u2019s wrong, says, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with\u00a0<em>me</em>?\u201d Jeongguk\u2019s ice cold, unfriendly, and cruel, and it\u2019s something Taehyung\u2019s rarely, if ever, had directed at him. \u201cI don\u2019t know, maybe I\u2019m just a little\u00a0<em>upset</em>\u00a0that you were having dinner with your ex-boyfriend.\u00a0<em>Without telling me</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>Taehyung\u2019s expression clears, and he starts to look annoyed, and sullen too, says crankily, \u201cSo what?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t <em>tell</em> me,\u201d Jeongguk says.</p>\n<p>\u201cI <em>forgot</em>,\u201d Taehyung crosses his arms over his chest, juts his chin out petulantly.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s silent for a moment, as they glare at each other, and Jeongguk doesn\u2019t know whether to blurt it all out, every single insecurity he\u2019s ever had about <em>Minjun</em>, or to turn around and walk away, to leave it festering and then go meet up with one of his own ex\u2019s so Taehyung can know exactly how it feels. Maybe he could hurt Taehyung just as badly as Taehyung\u2019s hurt him.</p>\n<p>But he can\u2019t do that to Taehyung, no matter what, not even when Taehyung\u2019s hurt him the most right now, after four years of dating.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou still wear his bracelet,\u201d Jeongguk says suddenly, eyes the brown leather.</p>\n<p>\u201cHuh?\u201d Taehyung says, eyes glancing down at it too. \u201cSo?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI hate it,\u201d Jeongguk says, a little bit fiercely, too rough to be anything less than brutally honest. \u201cI fucking <em>hate</em> it. When I see it \u2013 it\u2019s like\u2026it\u2019s as if you can never fully be mine, like you\u2019re holding onto something with <em>him</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>Taehyung looks shell shocked, sober for the first time all night. \u201cBut\u2026you never said anything before.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jeongguk only shrugs, looking for a better answer from Taehyung, something to reassure him, to take away four years worth of insecurities.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean anything to me,\u201d Taehyung says softly, so softly, and his voice quivers a little too, like everything\u2019s catching up with him and finally making sense. \u201cI just like the bracelet, it never meant anything. I\u2019m not holding onto Minjun, I <em>swear</em>, I promise, <em>Jeongguk</em>, I \u2013 <em>please</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>And maybe it\u2019s the pleading tone, or the wetness of Taehyung\u2019s eyes, or just Jeongguk\u2019s own resolve breaking \u2013 never very strong when it comes to Taehyung \u2013 but some of the ice in Jeongguk\u2019s expression melts away, a crack forms in the rough exterior, and Taehyung throws himself at Jeongguk.</p>\n<p>Jeongguk barely rocks backwards as he catches Taehyung\u2019s lithe body, curling tight arms around Taehyung\u2019s waist, just shy of possessive, and Taehyung buries his face somewhere in the space between Jeongguk\u2019s neck and shoulder, muffling these pathetic little sobs that make Jeongguk\u2019s heart hurt.</p>\n<p>And despite the instant reassurance from the strong arms that come up to catch him, and hold him close, Taehyung has to be sure, so he blubbers apologies into Jeongguk\u2019s neck. Because it\u2019s so strange to him, almost an alien feeling, for Jeongguk to be unyielding to Taehyung\u2019s hands. Like the walls Jeongguk built between himself and the rest of the world are suddenly keeping Taehyung out too. And all he can think about is how Jeongguk had turned cold eyes and an uncaring voice on him, and how Jeongguk didn\u2019t even want to be touched by Taehyung. It was like the Jeongguk of four years ago, when they first met, so callous and mean and unsympathetic, but even back then he never acted like that towards Taehyung. Even back then Taehyung was different to him.</p>\n<p>So it hurts to get that now, four years later, when Taehyung knows Jeongguk like the back of his hand and knows that Jeongguk wouldn\u2019t act like that if he wasn\u2019t truly upset.</p>\n<p>And Taehyung was the cause of that.</p>\n<p>\u201cTaehyung,\u201d Jeongguk says, and it\u2019s soft again, gentle and soothing, the side of Jeongguk that Taehyung never intended to take for granted. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, calm down.\u201d Taehyung\u2019s so relieved to hear it that he can\u2019t stop crying into Jeongguk\u2019s neck, hands gripping tight fists into the back of Jeongguk\u2019s shirt as he trembles in Jeongguk\u2019s arms, barely keeping himself together. It\u2019s half because of how fuzzy the alcohol makes his head feel, and half because they\u2019ve never had a fight like this before, leaving Taehyung an emotional wreck.</p>\n<p>When Jeongguk tries to pull back, Taehyung panics and grips onto his boyfriend tighter, and his own insecurities slip out in his fear. \u201c<em>Don\u2019t let go of me!</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>Jeongguk freezes for a moment, large hands on Taehyung\u2019s shoulders, before he slides them back down to curl around Taehyung\u2019s skinny frame, and Taehyung\u2019s wrapped in warmth and safety and love, and\u00a0<em>why can\u2019t he stop crying?</em></p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Taehyung says thickly, voice watery. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry for what I said, and what I did. Just \u2013\u00a0<em>please</em>, don\u2019t let go of me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI won\u2019t,\u201d Jeongguk says, voice both gentle but rough at the same time, somehow, the very contradictory mix that makes up Jeongguk, and he cups the back of Taehyung\u2019s head, fingers working through messy locks soothingly. \u201cI won\u2019t let you go.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPromise?\u201d Taehyung asks, voice small and meek, legs weak and unsteady and he\u2019s held up almost entirely because of Jeongguk\u2019s immovable form and the steady grip he has on Taehyung\u2019s smaller one.</p>\n<p>\u201cI promise.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>vi.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Taehyung\u2019s always been a pretty light sleeper, unlike Jeongguk, who could probably sleep through an earthquake if it ever happened \u2013 (he sleeps through thunderstorms, which is annoying because Taehyung always jerks awake at the first crack of thunder) (Jeongguk, even asleep, seems to feel it anyway because he always ends up reaching to tug Taehyung closer to him) \u2013 so Taehyung\u2019s the only one whose eyes snap open to the creaking sound of footsteps coming from the hallway.</p>\n<p>He blinks, confused and disoriented for a few seconds, stuck somewhere between dreams and reality, but then he hears it again, muffled footsteps and the front door closing, and something cold like fear settles in his stomach.</p>\n<p>\u201cJeongguk,\u201d he whispers, nudging the sleeping boy beside him. Jeongguk doesn\u2019t wake, doesn\u2019t even move, and when Taehyung hears the noise again he panics, shaking Jeongguk, his whispered voice wavering in his anxiety. \u201cJeongguk!\u201d</p>\n<p>Jeongguk\u2019s eyes flutter open, and he stares up at Taehyung for a second, brow furrowed in confusion, until a noise from the front of their apartment cuts through the silence of their bedroom, and Jeongguk props himself up on one arm, staring in bewilderment at their closed bedroom door.</p>\n<p>\u201cJeongguk,\u201d Taehyung\u2019s shaking hands settle on Jeongguk\u2019s arm, wrapping around the lean muscle because he can\u2019t tell if he wants Jeongguk to go check what it is or to stay with him, but Jeongguk decides for him.</p>\n<p>The younger sits up and presses a dry kiss to Taehyung\u2019s forehead, smiles gently down at him. \u201cStay here, okay? I\u2019ll go check it out.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, don\u2019t.\u201d Taehyung doesn\u2019t release his grip on Jeongguk\u2019s arm, because he\u2019s\u00a0<em>seen</em>\u00a0stuff like this on t.v, and in horror films too, and all he\u2019s learned from those movies if that you\u2019re never supposed to go check out the noise!</p>\n<p>But Jeongguk takes hold of Taehyung\u2019s hand that\u2019s wrapped around his arm and presses a kiss to the palm of it, and with a, \u201cI\u2019ll be right back\u201d, he heads out the door, annoyance and irritation set in his features before he shuts the door behind him.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s silent for a few moments, and Taehyung grips the comforter between white fingers as he strains to hear any sound at all. He startles when he hears a muffled bang and Jeongguk\u2019s, \u201cOh, what the\u00a0<em>fuck</em>?!\u201d</p>\n<p>Taehyung\u2019s up and grabbing Jeongguk\u2019s dance trophy off the shelf at that point \u2013 (the one that had actually fallen off the shelf and hit Taehyung\u2019s head one time when they were wrestling, and Taehyung had to go to the hospital and get staples in his head because it wouldn\u2019t stop bleeding, and Jeongguk had felt so bad about it that he treated Taehyung so delicately for a solid month afterwards, even though Taehyung didn\u2019t blame him for it, but still, it was nice, so nice, to be treated like the most precious thing in Jeongguk\u2019s life). His worry for Jeongguk overrides his fear, and he bursts out of their bedroom door with the trophy held high above his head.</p>\n<p>He finds Jeongguk in the hallway outside the kitchen, sprawled out on the floor with a drunk Jimin curled into his chest, and then Taehyung and Jeongguk blink at each other, Taehyung still holding the trophy as if it were a baseball bat.</p>\n<p>Jeongguk\u2019s irritated expression morphs into laughter. \u201cComing to save me?\u201d</p>\n<p>Taehyung lowers the impromptu weapon sheepishly. \u201cYeah.\u201d</p>\n<p>It\u2019s silent for a moment, until Jimin mumbles something about \u2018Hoseok\u2019 and \u2018stupid head\u2019, and then Taehyung sets the trophy down and moves to help get his best friend up and off of his boyfriend.</p>\n<p>Jimin wakes up when Taehyung slips his arm under Jimin\u2019s armpits to heave him up. \u201cTaetae!\u201d he exclaims, pushing off of a disgruntled Jeongguk to face plant into Taehyung\u2019s arms. \u201cI told the taxi guy driver man to take me home\u2026.to you! My favourite best friend Taetae!\u201d he pauses for a minute, eyes trying to focus on Taehyung. \u201cI love you so much, did you know that? Also I think I drank too much.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI think you did too,\u201d Taehyung laughs, half-dragging Jimin to their guest bedroom. Jeongguk moves to lift Jimin into his arms, because Taehyung\u2019s struggling a little bit under Jimin\u2019s drunk weight, so Taehyung goes to fluff the pillows and get a glass of water to place by the bed. Jimin\u2019s still slurring about Hoseok (his crush), and about \u2018stupid-head\u2019 (aka Hoseok), and how \u2018stupid-head\u2019 doesn\u2019t even like him back (Hoseok probably had to leave the club early and Jimin\u2019s drunk brain probably took it personally).</p>\n<p>He pets Jimin\u2019s hair as he settles under the sheets. \u201cDon\u2019t die in the night, okay Jiminie? Get a good sleep.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI love you Taetae,\u201d Jimin mumbles. \u201cYou always take care of me the best, and I love you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI love you too Jiminie,\u201d Taehyung pets his head one last time before turning off the lights and leaving the room. Jeongguk\u2019s waiting for him in the dimly light hallway. \u201cEverything okay?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Taehyung says, and suddenly yawns, and he feels ten times more tired now, after the adrenaline wares off.</p>\n<p>Jeongguk reaches for Taehyung\u2019s hand and tugs him back to their bedroom. \u201cLet\u2019s get you to bed.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cM\u2019kay,\u201d Taehyung nods sleepily, and ducks under Jeongguk\u2019s arm so he can tuck himself against the lean line of muscle. Taehyung could probably fall asleep standing up, in Jeongguk\u2019s arms, because everything\u2019s warm and soft and safe, except Jeongguk urges him forward with a warm hand on his lower back, and Taehyung follows, crawling onto the bed until he reaches his side, and flops down under the covers. His eyes snap back open though, when he suddenly remembers. \u201cHey Jeonggukie?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCould you, just like, check all the windows? And double check the door? That everything\u2019s locked?\u201d Taehyung tries to sound nonchalant, because sometimes people find paranoia laughable or annoying, but Jeongguk only smiles in understanding and presses a third kiss to Taehyung\u2019s cheek, just under his eye, and a fourth one to Taehyung\u2019s forehead.</p>\n<p>\u201cBe right back.\u201d</p>\n<p>Taehyung sits cross-legged in bed until Jeongguk returns, because it wouldn\u2019t be fair of him to sleep, and he gives Jeongguk a sleepy smile when he gets back.</p>\n<p>\u201cAll good,\u201d Jeongguk says, and he closes the bedroom door behind him before sliding into the bed next to Taehyung. The slighter boy immediately cuddles into Jeongguk\u2019s warm body, really sleepy now, eyes barely opening with each blink.</p>\n<p>\u201cThank you, I love you,\u201d Taehyung makes sure to say though, and even in exhaustion the words are so different from how he says them to Jimin, the words holding weight in them, heavy with affection and tenderness.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s almost asleep when he hears Jeongguk\u2019s warm, \u201cI love you too\u201d, one arm curling tighter around his body, and he knows that the delicateness with which Jeongguk treated him when he was hurt didn\u2019t end after that month. Taehyung\u2019s always been the most precious thing in Jeongguk\u2019s life.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>vii.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The time Taehyung realizes that it\u2019s a thing, that he really,\u00a0<em>really</em>\u00a0has something for Jeongguk\u2019s strength \u2013 for how easy it is for Jeongguk to pick Taehyung up and move him around, for how much raw power Jeongguk has, for knowing how strong Jeongguk is but being someone Jeongguk reigns that strength in for \u2013 it\u2019s when they\u2019re wrestling for the remote, because Jeongguk wants to watch a crime show on t.v., but Taehyung wants to watch an elephant documentary on the discovery channel.</p>\n<p>They\u2019re on the bed, on the thick, plush comforter, and Taehyung\u2019s trying to stretch his arms up to where Jeongguk can\u2019t reach, but Jeongguk\u2019s pressing him down into the bed with his larger body so that Taehyung can\u2019t move, even though he tries his hardest to squirm out of Jeongguk\u2019s grip (he\u2019s not trying very hard though, because being under Jeongguk is probably Taehyung\u2019s most favourite place in the world).</p>\n<p>Jeongguk traps his wrists above his head with one hand, the other one plucking the remote out of Taehyung\u2019s now limp fingers. Because Taehyung\u2019s completely forgotten about the remote by this point, the slight burn of the stretch of his arms above his head sending a sudden shock of heat scorching through his body. Even his toes are tingling.</p>\n<p>\u201cLet\u2019s not watch t.v.,\u201d Taehyung blurts out when Jeongguk starts to push himself up, and Jeongguk pauses his movements, glancing down at Taehyung. He takes in Taehyung\u2019s flushed features, his dilated pupils, the raggedness in his breathing, and then something quirks in his lips, and Jeongguk settles more heavily atop of Taehyung.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cN-No,\u201d Taehyung stumbles over his words, but he manages to meet Jeongguk\u2019s heated gaze. \u201cLet\u2019s do something more fun.\u201d It\u2019s almost a question, a slight hint of Taehyung\u2019s natural submissiveness surfacing, always peeking through whenever he finds himself under Jeongguk\u2019s broader form.</p>\n<p>Jeongguk smirks, slow and lazy, like he\u2019s completely unbothered about Taehyung\u2019s trembling form beneath him. \u201cFun? What did you have in mind?\u201d</p>\n<p>Taehyung huffs in annoyance, because it\u2019s\u00a0<em>obvious</em>, what he has in mind, and he opens his mouth to say something maybe a little bit meanly, but then Jeongguk rolls his hips downwards, and Taehyung\u2019s mind goes blank in pure pleasure.</p>\n<p>\u201cTell me,\u201d Jeongguk\u2019s voice is low, rough, and commanding, and Taehyung\u2019s thoughts are all jumbled up and tangled together, and the only thing he can really focus on is the strength in Jeongguk\u2019s hand that holds his wrist together and the gentleness of his other that\u2019s stroking the smooth skin of Taehyung\u2019s hip.</p>\n<p>\u201cT-Touch me,\u201d Taehyung manages to whimper out, squirming again but this time it\u2019s not to get out of Jeongguk\u2019s grip, but to get closer to the source of heat above him.</p>\n<p>\u201cI am touching you,\u201d Jeongguk says, in mock confusion, like he doesn\u2019t know what Taehyung wants him to do. Where Taehyung wants him to touch. \u201cYou\u2019re going to have to be more specific, Taehyung.\u201d</p>\n<p>Taehyung whines in response, because it\u2019s embarrassing to say, especially when Jeongguk looks so unbothered above him while Taehyung\u2019s practically gagging for it.</p>\n<p>\u201cSay it,\u201d Jeongguk commands, and Taehyung\u2019s mind falls somewhere white hot and completely delicious, a place where the only thing that matters is the strong body above him and large hands that tether him to it. So when that body moves, upwards the scant few centimeters to create space between Taehyung and its reassuring warmth, Taehyung whimpers in need, his socked feet curling around the ankle of the muscular leg between his own slender ones.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Fuck me</em>,\u201d Taehyung manages to get out, something between begging and demanding, and then Jeongguk drops his body back down, rough and dominating in his movements, and Taehyung squirms needily, practically rutting against the thigh between his legs. \u201cPlease, oh please,\u00a0<em>Jeongguk</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jeongguk\u2019s eyes darken then, and both of his hands yank Taehyung\u2019s shirt off, followed by his own, and then Taehyung\u2019s eyes catch on the smooth stretch of muscle across Jeongguk\u2019s shoulders and down his chest, the faint lines of his abdomen, that he doesn\u2019t realize Jeongguk\u2019s worked off both of their pants too.</p>\n<p>He pauses then, sitting up on his knees and his chest heaving in a way that lets Taehyung know Jeongguk\u2019s just as affected, that he\u2019s not as nonchalant as he pretends to be. And his eyes rake down Taehyung\u2019s naked frame, from the hands still crossed over each other above Taehyung\u2019s head, down to the smooth golden skin of Taehyung\u2019s tummy, the pink flush on Taehyung\u2019s cheeks and between his legs, the way Taehyung\u2019s legs fall open so naturally to accommodate Jeongguk\u2019s larger body.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Fuck,</em>\u201d Jeongguk breathes out, fingers gliding smoothly over the skin of Taehyung\u2019s legs to grip at the flesh of Taehyung\u2019s thighs. One hand moves further, thumb pressing into the jut of Taehyung\u2019s hip and following the line down towards Taehyung\u2019s cock, but then deliberately moving away again, down Taehyung\u2019s inner thigh and barely grazing his quivering hole. \u201cFuck,\u201d Jeongguk says again. \u201cI want to leave marks all\u00a0<em>over you</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p><em>Yeah</em>, Taehyung thinks, almost sobbing in his need to be touched, and he squirms desperately, trying to rock downwards and closer to those warm hands. \u201cDo it, then,\u201d he dares, but it comes out as more of a plea, and there\u2019s quick flash of a smirk from Jeongguk\u2019s lips before he\u2019s sinking his teeth into the soft skin of Taehyung\u2019s inner thigh, leaving a trail of bruises upwards, towards the painfully hard cock.</p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t touch Taehyung where he needs it most,\u00a0<em>again</em>, moving to the other thigh to give it the same treatment, pressing chaste kisses and possessive marks into the smooth skin until he finally leans back, satisfied, hands roaming over the marks.</p>\n<p>Taehyung huffs in annoyance. He\u00a0<em>still</em>\u00a0hasn\u2019t been touched, and Jeongguk\u2019s not even\u00a0<em>looking</em>\u00a0at him. \u201cWhat if someone sees them?\u201d</p>\n<p><em>This</em>\u00a0makes Jeongguk glance up sharply, hands curling around Taehyung\u2019s thighs. \u201cWho exactly would be looking at you down here? Who, except me, would see you here?\u201d</p>\n<p>He leans back over Taehyung, settling over the smaller boy, and finally,\u00a0<em>finally</em>\u00a0grinds downwards, and Taehyung throws his head back, hurtling towards a sea of white. \u201c<em>No one.</em>\u201d Jeongguk tells him, and Taehyung knows that, obviously, but he loves this, loves how he can rile Jeongguk up until Jeongguk presses him down into the mattress, loves that he can push at Jeongguk\u2019s buttons until Jeongguk reminds him who he belongs to.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo one,\u201d Taehyung agrees, locking his feet around Jeongguk, and he brings his arms down to wrap one around Jeongguk\u2019s neck, strokes a thumb over Jeongguk\u2019s cheek with the other. His eyes say more than words ever could, and then he smiles up at Jeongguk, warm and wide and boxy, eyes crinkling into crescents, and his hand, pressed to Jeongguk\u2019s chest, can feel how Jeongguk\u2019s heart beats just a little bit faster. And Taehyung thinks he\u2019s never loved anyone more in his life than the boy above him who\u2019s a little bit rough and sometimes a bit insensitive and maybe a little bit mean, but he\u2019s also so soft and so gentle, and he treats Taehyung like he\u2019s something so precious to him. And maybe he\u2019s like that because of Taehyung, or maybe it\u2019s because underneath everything, underneath the tough exterior and the sky-high walls, his heart\u2019s more delicate than Taehyung\u2019s, but all Taehyung knows is that Jeongguk fills up all of Taehyung's vulnerable pieces with parts of himself.</p>\n<p>\u201cDo it slow, okay?\u201d Taehyung whispers, his entire world narrowed down to Jeongguk\u2019s soft breath against his face and Jeongguk\u2019s warm heartbeat under his palm.</p>\n<p>Something in Jeongguk\u2019s expression shifts, softens, goes so gentle that it\u2019s almost too hard for Taehyung to look at, and then Jeongguk whispers back, \u201cOkay.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jeongguk draws everything out, fingers Taehyung until he\u2019s falling apart and begging for something more, something to fill him up like fingers never could, and even though Jeongguk\u2019s hands are gentle his movements are rough, never able to completely hold onto his strength when he\u2019s lost within Taehyung.</p>\n<p>And Taehyung \u2013 he\u00a0<em>loves</em>\u00a0it.</p>\n<p>He loves the slow breakdown of Jeongguk\u2019s resolve, the way Jeongguk\u2019s biceps clench beneath his skin when he fists his hands in the sheet beneath Taehyung, the roughness of Jeongguk finally pushing into him, and the power behind each slow thrust, the bruises on Taehyung\u2019s hips that Jeongguk\u2019s fingers leave behind.</p>\n<p>Taehyung\u2019s pleas for\u00a0<em>more</em>\u00a0are almost loud enough to cover the sound of slapping skin on skin, and Jeongguk\u2019s curled above his body, hair messy and sticking to his forehead, and Taehyung presses his lips to his temple in a barely-there kiss, whispers an \u201cI love you\u201d because he does, he really, really does, and he always wants Jeongguk to know.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Jeongguk breathes, eyes fixed on the raw expressions of Taehyung\u2019s face, and then he finally leans down to kiss Taehyung, hot and wet and completely dominating the smaller boy until Taehyung breaks the kiss, panting and eyes half-lidded.</p>\n<p>Jeongguk presses gentle kisses to Taehyung\u2019s nose and eye lids, so contradictory to the raw strength of his thrusts deep inside Taehyung, and that juxtaposition is so significant to Taehyung, so precious to him, that his eyes suddenly feel a little wet and he has to turn his head to the side, too overwhelmed with the rush of emotion making his throat constrict.</p>\n<p>He catches sight of Jeongguk\u2019s wrist next to his face, the strain of his muscle, and the swirl of blue veins under the skin that remind Taehyung that as strong as Jeongguk is, he has a delicate weakness in him too. Because Jeongguk had been so aloof and distant and unsociable when they had first met, so hardened by the world already. But Taehyung had been determined, and broken down the callous and apathetic walls surrounding Jeongguk\u2019s heart, rebuilding them with himself inside, pumping life back into Jeongguk, and maybe Taehyung\u2019s sometimes stronger than Jeongguk. Not physically stronger, but stronger at something else, at something Taehyung can\u2019t put a name too.</p>\n<p>And that delicate weakness is something Taehyung protects with his whole entire being, so he leans forward to press a soft kiss to the fragile skin on the inside of Jeongguk\u2019s wrist.</p>\n<p>Jeongguk stills for a second, above him, and then tangles their hands together, next to Taehyung\u2019s face, and thrusts even harder, but just as slow, until Taehyung\u2019s toes are curling and the sparks of electricity running up and down his spine make his body feel like it\u2019s too hot and he\u2019s coming,\u00a0<em>oh god he\u2019s coming</em>, shooting white between them, face pressed into the space between Jeongguk\u2019s neck and shoulder. Jeongguk thrusts a few more times, his pace never faltering until Taehyung can feel him coming too, the jerkiness of his hips not letting up in his bruising pace.</p>\n<p>Afterwards, when Jeongguk\u2019s cleaned them up and Taehyung\u2019s tucked under the blanket and Jeongguk\u2019s arm, he presses a soft kiss to Jeongguk\u2019s pectoral, whispers, \u201cI love that you\u2019re strong enough to carry me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah?\u2019 Jeongguk asks, one hand brushing Taehyung\u2019s bangs out of his eyes.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Taehyung murmurs. \u201cBut\u2026\u201d he\u2019s flushed a pretty pink from embarrassment, and tucks his face against Jeongguk\u2019s warm skin, so that the words are barely audible, more felt than heard. \u201cBut I love it more that you treat me\u2026gently. Like I\u2019m precious to you or something.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jeongguk\u2019s silent for a moment. \u201cYou\u00a0<em>are</em>\u00a0precious to me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Taehyung doesn\u2019t hide the wide grin that graces his features, happy and pleased and delighted, and filled with so much love. And he feels like his heart might burst from the amount of love in it for Jeongguk, for this boy who fits Taehyung like a puzzle piece that wasn\u2019t supposed to, like a puzzle piece that came from another box but somehow fit to Taehyung, and all Taehyung knows is that he doesn\u2019t care if he\u2019s supposed to fit one puzzle and Jeongguk\u2019s supposed to fit another, because he superglued Jeongguk to him and nothing\u2019s going to pull them apart. Nothing could separate them back into those two different puzzles.</p>"
