This piece was strangely cathartic to write.

  "text": "<p>Draco's suspicions are born the night they first make love. </p>\n<p>They are three dates in, not counting that initial, coincidental encounter in Diagon Alley. Date number three consists of dinner at some Muggle establishment Harry has chosen. A hole-in-the-wall Italian restaurant with dingy floors, dim lighting and too many tables crammed in too small a space. </p>\n<p>To his surprise, Draco discovers he quite likes spaghetti. And despite its shabbiness, the restaurant has some sort of unassuming charm that he can\u2019t place his finger on. Though it may have something to do with the company. </p>\n<p>Harry is gorgeous. The simple truth of this is undeniable. In the two weeks since they\u2019ve started dating- six years and some odd months out of Hogwarts- the other man has utterly consumed Draco\u2019s thoughts. His dreams are filled with visions of black hair and tan skin and ethereal green eyes. He has never been so captivated by someone.</p>\n<p>And judging from the way Harry is currently rubbing his foot up and down Draco\u2019s shin underneath the checkered tablecloth, the other man feels the same, undeniable attraction. </p>\n<p>They opt to skip dessert. Nearly drunk with desire, they Apparate directly back to Harry\u2019s flat after a hastily finished meal.</p>\n<p>They fall into bed, a tangle of limbs and panting breaths and warm mouths. Draco shudders as Harry threads his fingers in his hair and tugs sharply, the action sending tingles all the way to his toes. He responds in kind by pressing several open-mouthed kisses up Harry\u2019s jawline.</p>\n<p>\u201cGod, Draco,\u201d Harry moans, his voice breathy. Humming in response, Draco grasps Harry by the chin and pulls him forward to seal their mouths together.</p>\n<p>The kiss grows nearly violent in intensity, with clacking teeth and bitten lips and dueling tongues. Draco feels his heart flutter wildly as Harry pushes him back against the headboard of the bed, breaking their kiss to straddle his lap. </p>\n<p>Groaning at the sensation of Harry\u2019s body settling against his arousal, Draco buries his face in the crook of the man\u2019s neck, latching his mouth and setting to sucking bruises on sensitive skin. Above him, Harry lets out a startled gasp and digs his fingers into Draco\u2019s shoulders. </p>\n<p>He scrapes his teeth against the newly mottled skin in reply. Suddenly, deft hands are trailing down his back, grasping his shirt by the hem and pulling up. </p>\n<p>\u201cOff,\u201d Harry demands, tugging at Draco\u2019s shirt frantically.</p>\n<p>Reluctantly, he lifts his mouth from Harry\u2019s neck so he can pull the offending garment over his head.</p>\n<p>\u201cAh!\u201d Draco gasps as Harry pulls him even closer, brazenly rubbing his clothed erection against his stomach. \u201cOh, Merlin- <em>Harry-\"</em> </p>\n<p>Harry moans in response, continuing to rut frantically, the rough material of his jeans abrasive against Draco\u2019s bare skin, but in such a nice way-</p>\n<p>All at once, the thought occurs to Draco that they are both wearing far too much clothing. </p>\n<p>Reaching a hand between their bodies, he gropes blindly before locating and tugging down the zipper of Harry\u2019s jeans. His hand hovers on the waistband of his pants, wordlessly asking permission. </p>\n<p>Harry licks his ear and grinds his erection into Draco\u2019s palm. </p>\n<p>Taking this as an affirmation, Draco wastes no time in tugging the other man\u2019s trousers and pants down and off his hips. Licking his hand, he reaches down and touches Harry\u2019s cock for the first time, beginning to stroke languidly up and down the length. </p>\n<p>\u201cOh, fuck,\u201d Harry breathes in his ear, hands ghosting up and down Draco\u2019s bare chest. \u201cOh my god, faster, <em>please.\"</em> He begins to buck his hips into Draco\u2019s fist, action somewhat limited by the restricting fabric still bunched around his thighs. </p>\n<p>Growling, Draco releases Harry\u2019s now weeping cock and pulls at his waist, prompting the man to lift his hips so Draco can slide his pants down and off his legs. </p>\n<p>\u201cYou too,\u201d Harry gasps, tugging insistently at the fabric of Draco's trousers. \u201cWant to see you too.\u201d </p>\n<p>Draco hurriedly complies, stripping off the rest of his clothing without hesitation. He nearly groans in relief as his cock springs free from the tight confines of his trousers. Harry wastes no time in straddling Draco\u2019s lap again, capturing his mouth in another breathless kiss and rutting their bare erections against each other. </p>\n<p>Mindlessly, Draco grabs Harry\u2019s shirt and tries to pull it off over his head- the only piece of clothing still separating them. </p>\n<p>He is unprepared for the intensity of Harry\u2019s reaction. Instantly, the other man freezes, his entire body stiffening in obvious alarm. Still straddling his lap, Harry's body halts where he had been eagerly thrusting against Draco moments ago, limbs suddenly tense and rigid.</p>\n<p>Draco pauses, horribly confused and unbelievably aroused. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d he manages, hands tightening on Harry\u2019s hips, struggling to think clearly through the cloud of lust fogging his mind. </p>\n<p>Harry\u2019s eyes meet Draco\u2019s, his pupils blown and dilated so only a rim of green iris is visible. Seemingly coming back to himself, his body relaxes minutely. \u201cNothing,\u201d he mumbles, grabbing Draco\u2019s hands and pulling them down to rest on his bare thighs. Exhaling shakily, he pulls his shirt off and tosses it on the floor. \u201cKiss me again,\u201d he demands suddenly, pulling Draco\u2019s face forward and locking their lips together in another bruising kiss before he can think too closely about what has just transpired. </p>\n<p>Draco takes Harry that first night. Works him open with one, then two, then three fingers, taking his sweet time to coax every languid moan out of the man until he is practically sobbing for more. Face to face, they make love for the first time, with Harry\u2019s legs locked around his waist, fingers digging bruises into Draco\u2019s hips as he drives deeply into the other man\u2019s body. </p>\n<p>\u201cHarder, oh, yes! God, right <em>there-\"</em></p>\n<p>Draco complies, pounding his hips flush against Harry\u2019s ass, panting from the intensity of his efforts. Below him, Harry cranes his flushed neck backwards, moaning wantonly, erection bobbing up and down as Draco\u2019s actions jolt his body. </p>\n<p>Draco watches, mesmerized, as his cock pistons in and out of Harry. A sort of surreal, out of body experience occurs as he realizes that, yes, the gorgeous man he\u2019s currently fucking is indeed Harry Potter. </p>\n<p>\u201cTake it,\u201d Draco growls, leaning down to press a sloppy, possessive kiss against the man\u2019s bare chest. From this position, he can\u2019t thrust as deeply, but it\u2019s worth it to be able to taste Harry\u2019s skin.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, Merlin! I\u2019m close. <em>Draco-\"</em></p>\n<p>He latches his mouth on the man\u2019s nipple, lightly suckling the raised nub. Reaching a hand down between their writhing bodies, he grasps Harry\u2019s straining erection and pumps hastily, thumbing the slit of his cock with each upward stroke-</p>\n<p>Harry lets out a loud, keening sound. Draco feels his cock twitch in his hand. And then, Harry is coming, shuddering beautifully as wet streams paint his stomach and warm Draco\u2019s hand.</p>\n<p>Draco continues to stroke him through his release, breath hitching as Harry\u2019s ass clenches tightly around his cock. Leaning down to rest his forehead against the man\u2019s chest, Draco growls and bucks once, twice, and then he is coming too, pulsing and releasing deep inside Harry\u2019s body, continuing to fuck him through his orgasm. </p>\n<p>The room grows silent save for their heaving breaths. Limbs suddenly shaky and uncoordinated, Draco allows his body to collapse. Pulling his softening cock from Harry\u2019s ass, he mouths an apologetic kiss against the man\u2019s neck when he gives a slight grimace at the action. \u201cAlright?\u201d he asks, rolling off Harry\u2019s body, leaving one arm slung casually over his chest.</p>\n<p>\u201cMore than,\u201d Harry laughs, trailing his hand up and down Draco\u2019s arm. \u201cThat was bloody brilliant.\u201d </p>\n<p>Draco hums in agreement and closes his eyes, sated and drowsy from his recent orgasm. </p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019ll stay?\u201d </p>\n<p>The question is soft and sounds more like a statement. Draco smiles lazily. \u201cOf course.\u201d </p>\n<p>Another moment passes, and then Harry presses a kiss against his bare shoulder and sits upright, swinging his legs over the side of the bed. \u201cI\u2019m going to clean up and grab some water. Want anything?\u201d </p>\n<p>Draco opens his eyes. \u201cNo, I'm fine-\u201d </p>\n<p>His voice cuts off abruptly. It is hard to see well in the dim light of the bedroom, but now that Harry faces away from him for the first time, he can see that the man\u2019s back is badly scarred. Dozens of pale lines crisscross the tan skin, some flush to his body, others twisted and raised-</p>\n<p>Before he can comment or look any closer, Harry leans down and pulls on his discarded shirt, hiding his back from view. \u201cAlright, I'll just be a minute,\u201d he comments without looking back at Draco, standing and treading barefoot and bare-assed from the bedroom. </p>\n<p>Draco stares at the retreating figure. Resting his head back down against a pillow, he wonders for half a moment if it\u2019d been a trick of the light. But no- the marks on Harry\u2019s back are undeniably scars. Draco\u2019s gut clenches as he contemplates their origins. From Harry\u2019s Auror work? Or from the war, perhaps? Draco has his own collection of such scars.</p>\n<p>But something about these particular marks- so many of them, and so systematically striped up and down Harry\u2019s back, turned practically silver with age- makes Draco feel deeply unsettled in a way he can't put in words. </p>\n<p>Harry returns a minute later, spelling the lights off wandlessly and crawling into bed. Curling up against Draco, he sighs contentedly and buries his face in the hollow of his neck. They lay together in companionable silence. Draco isn\u2019t sure if Harry realizes he\u2019s seen the scars, but the other man doesn\u2019t mention it, so neither does he.</p>\n<p>\u201cNight,\u201d Harry mumbles sleepily, his breath warm and moist against Draco\u2019s neck. </p>\n<p>\u201cGoodnight,\u201d Draco replies, absentmindedly interlacing his legs with Harry\u2019s. </p>\n<p>Seemingly moments later, Harry\u2019s breaths even out, face going slack and relaxed with sleep. Lulled by the sound of the other man\u2019s breathing, Draco soon follows suit, musings and misgivings momentarily forgotten as he surrenders unto sleep.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>* * *</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The weeks pass in a blur. Draco and Harry continue to see each other more and more frequently, at first several times a week, then practically every day. Draco sleeps over at Harry\u2019s flat most nights- a logical conclusion, since Harry\u2019s bed is where most of their evenings end. </p>\n<p>Draco asks about the scars several weeks later, after a particularly satisfying round of sex. \u201cOh, you know,\u201d is Harry\u2019s incredibly vague response when Draco casually asks what the scars are from.</p>\n<p>His voice is carefully composed, but his eyes betray the depth of his discomfort at the question. Draco immediately drops the subject. Harry is less reserved about removing his shirt after that brief conversation, but Draco notices that he tends to tense up whenever his back is touched, and that he <em>always</em> needs to be facing Draco during sex, regardless of their position. </p>\n<p>Draco chalks it up to sensitivity, but even so, can\u2019t quite shake his unease.</p>\n<p>His suspicions continue to mount over the weeks as he notices the strange, off-colour comments Harry occasionally makes during their day to day life. </p>\n<p>Harry lives in a Muggle neighborhood, and has a handful of peculiar, Muggle artifacts that absolutely fascinate Draco. There\u2019s the funny machine in his kitchen- a tiny box that you place food inside of, and then like magic, the food is hot again. </p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not magic,\u201d Harry laughs the first time Draco comments on this. \u201cIt\u2019s electricity.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cElect-whaty?\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cElectricity,\u201d Harry repeats patiently. \u201cDidn\u2019t you take Muggle Studies?\u201d </p>\n<p>Draco frowns and takes a bite of reheated pizza- another food Harry has introduced him to which he finds he quite likes. \u201cOf course not. My father would have never allowed it. That\u2019s why I have you to explain things. What\u2019s electricity, then?\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco\u2019s mind quickly grows numb as Harry talks about electricity and energy and wires and something called power-lines (whatever the hell those are). Despite his boredom, Draco feigns interest and asks more questions, simply because he likes the way Harry\u2019s eyes light up when he explains about these sort of things.</p>\n<p>There are other strange machines too. Another kitchen appliance which takes food and whirls it around inside until it turns to liquid. Draco doesn\u2019t see the point of that one. And a corded, noisy thing which Harry occasionally pushes around his flat- something called a hoover, which Harry explains, \u201csucks up dirt.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cWhy not use a cleaning charm?\u201d Draco asks, genuinely confused. </p>\n<p>Harry smiles tightly. \u201cForce of habit, I suppose.\u201d </p>\n<p>And then, there\u2019s Draco\u2019s favorite machine. The <em>telly.</em> A square, shiny box tucked in the corner of the sitting room. Draco is enraptured the first time Harry shows it to him. The bright, garish colors and loud noises are absolutely hypnotizing. He sits there for hours that first night, crouched on the floor, pushing the button that magically changes the picture. He flips mindlessly between screen after screen until his eyes water and burn and Harry has to physically take and hide the remote from him. </p>\n<p>This is how they spend many lazy evenings together. Curled up on Harry\u2019s sofa watching television after dinner.</p>\n<p>\u201cCan\u2019t believe I didn\u2019t know about this sooner,\u201d Draco admits one night, head comfortably tucked up under Harry\u2019s chin. The two of them sit cuddled on the couch watching an old film- one of Harry\u2019s favorites. Draco can\u2019t remember the name, but it involves outer-space and lots of men dressed in funny white suits. \u201cI would have loved television as a child. Absolutely brilliant, it is. Can\u2019t believe Muggles invented it before wizards.\u201d </p>\n<p>Harry hums in response and strokes a hand up and down his arm. \u201cI know. I think I would have liked it too.\u201d</p>\n<p>On screen, several men begin to sword-fight with brightly glowing sticks. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Draco asks, suddenly distracted. \u201cDidn\u2019t you have television growing up? You said practically all Muggles have one. Weren\u2019t you raised by Muggles?\u201d </p>\n<p>Behind him, Draco feels Harry tense, arms stiffening minutely around his body. \u201cYes,\u201d Harry answers after a long moment, voice so quiet that Draco can hardly hear him above the din of the television. \u201cI was.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cSo, they didn\u2019t have a telly, then?\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cThey did,\u201d Harry replies carefully. \u201cI never watched it, though.\u201d </p>\n<p>Draco frowns, wriggling his body from Harry\u2019s grasp so he can turn around to look him properly in the face. \u201cWhy not?\u201d </p>\n<p>Harry\u2019s eyes are shiny with an emotion Draco can\u2019t place. \u201cWasn\u2019t allowed.\u201d He purses his mouth, suddenly tight-lipped, and turns away to stare pointedly at the television.</p>\n<p>Draco can take a hint. Easing back against Harry\u2019s chest, he turns his attentions toward the movie, smiling involuntarily when he feels Harry press a gentle kiss on his hair. </p>\n<p>Despite his newfound love for television, Draco finds it difficult to pay attention to the conclusion of the movie. He supposes he can understand why Harry hadn\u2019t been allowed to watch <em>this</em> sort of television as a child. The film is rather violent, after all. But there are so many different sorts of shows on the funny little box- some of them made specifically <em>for</em> children, as Harry had explained it. </p>\n<p>Draco\u2019s heart flutters in his chest. There is something terribly disconcerting about Harry\u2019s tone of voice. So guarded and controlled and careful with his words. The same way he\u2019d sounded when he talked about his scars, several weeks earlier.</p>\n<p>Something about the situation doesn\u2019t sit right with Draco. But he hardly feels comfortable pushing the matter with Harry, so new and unfamiliar is their relationship. And so, he buries his concerns deep, deep down and resolves to forget about the matter entirely.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>* * *</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Draco quickly comes to realize that Harry has a <em>thing</em> about food. </p>\n<p>He is unwaveringly religious about mealtimes. He never skips a meal if he can help it, and he is strangely insistent that Draco follow this same, unspoken rule. </p>\n<p>\u201cCome on, let\u2019s go have breakfast,\u201d Harry murmurs to him one lazy Sunday morning when they\u2019ve decided to have a bit of a lie in. </p>\n<p>Still half asleep, Draco turns his head from where it rests on the man\u2019s shoulder and presses an unhurried kiss against his collarbone. \u201cHmm,\u201d he hums senselessly. </p>\n<p>Harry chuckles, ghosting his hand up and down his rib-cage. \u201cCome on, it\u2019s nearly past ten. We should eat something.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Draco grouses, mouthing wetly at Harry\u2019s bare shoulder as he begins to lightly rut his morning erection against the man\u2019s hip. \u201cThink I\u2019d rather have <em>you</em> for breakfast.\u201d </p>\n<p>Harry laughs, his voice breathy. \u201cLater. Food first.\u201d </p>\n<p>Draco frowns, stilling his ministrations. \u201cI\u2019m not hungry. Though perhaps I <em>could</em> be persuaded to eat <em>something,\"</em> he leers, running his hand down Harry\u2019s chest and cupping the man\u2019s groin through his thin pajama pants. </p>\n<p>To his surprise and slight hurt, Harry grabs Draco\u2019s wrist and pushes his hand away. \u201cYou need to eat,\u201d he says, voice strangely urgent.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s practically lunchtime,\u201d Draco whines, fully aware of how childish he sounds but beyond caring. He\u2019s horny, for fuck sake. \u201cWe can eat then.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo. Now,\u201d Harry demands, abruptly sitting up and nudging Draco\u2019s head off his shoulder. </p>\n<p>Draco merely stares, taken aback by the uncharacteristically demanding tone of the man\u2019s voice. \u201cFine, then,\u201d he concedes, huffing as he adjusts his now half-hard cock in his pants with a grimace. \u201cNo need to get your knickers in such a twist.\u201d </p>\n<p>Harry smiles, though it doesn\u2019t reach his eyes. Leaning over, he presses an apologetic kiss against Draco\u2019s temple before rising from bed. \u201cCome on. I\u2019ll even make those pancakes you like so much.\u201d</p>\n<p>One of the many perks of dating Harry Potter is that he is, surprisingly, an excellent cook. Having been raised solely on catered meals, both at home and then again at Hogwarts, Draco is a shoddy cook at best. Since his move out of the Manor, he has subsided primarily on tinned food and takeaway. It is a welcome change to eat home-cooked meals again.</p>\n<p>He helps Harry with the cooking sometimes. Chopping and dicing things he can handle well enough; it\u2019s just like preparing potion ingredients. But he could never do what Harry does. Flying throughout the kitchen, stirring pots and sprinkling spices and flipping things expertly in frying pans. Cooking delicious meals without so much as a recipe. The man is a bloody wonder.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhere did you learn to cook, anyway?\u201d Draco asks offhandedly one evening. They are enjoying a late dinner of mushroom ravioli- entirely handmade. </p>\n<p>Across the table, Harry freezes, fork raised halfway to his mouth. \u201cI did a lot of cooking as a child,\u201d he responds after a long moment. </p>\n<p>Draco chews thoughtfully. \u201cWho taught you? They must have been an excellent cook.\u201d </p>\n<p>Harry stiffens. Draco sees his throat visibly spasm as he swallows a bite of pasta. \u201cMy Aunt Petunia,\u201d he says shortly, his expression tense.</p>\n<p>By now, Draco knows that Harry had been raised by some Muggle relatives, but this is the first time he\u2019s mentioned any of them by name. Before Draco can ask any further questions, Harry abruptly changes the subject. </p>\n<p>\u201cMore ravioli?\u201d He grabs the serving bowl from the center of the table, offering it to Draco.</p>\n<p>Draco glances down at his plate, still half full with pasta. \u201cNo, thank you.\u201d </p>\n<p>Harry nods tightly and spoons himself the remainder instead. </p>\n<p>This is another thing Draco has noticed about Harry. How vehemently he despises food waste. Harry always clears his plate and never throws away leftovers. He eats everything he cooks- or else he carefully wraps the food up in foil, no matter how little is left, and tucks it away in the fridge for later. Even questionable foods like the butts of bread and skins of vegetables, Harry insists on eating.</p>\n<p>\u201cFood is food,\u201d Harry states frankly when Draco questions him about it one day, after he finds the man methodically working his way through an entire bunch of overripe bananas. \u201cBetter to eat it than let it go to waste.\u201d </p>\n<p>Draco could have dismissed all these things as quirks. Strange habits, perhaps carried over from childhood. That is, until the incident that occurs roughly six months into their relationship. </p>\n<p>By this point, Draco has all but moved in with Harry. He still visits his own flat on occasion, but only to exchange clothes or grab various items he has need for. </p>\n<p>It is mid-January, and the winter days are short and bitterly cold. Harry is heavily invested in a difficult case at work. From what he\u2019s explained to Draco, a group of Ministry officiants have gone missing, with no explanation to their disappearance. The only commonality they share is that all six are Muggle-born. </p>\n<p>Foul play is suspected. Specifically, from a small cult of Pure-bloods- radicals that still live by Voldemort\u2019s outdated ideologies. </p>\n<p>As Harry grimly puts it, <em>if</em> the officiants are still alive, time is of the essence. He and several other senior Aurors have been handpicked for the case. For weeks upon weeks, Harry works tirelessly. He spends up to twenty hours at a time on the job, leading raids and scouring various sites for any shard of evidence. Even when he's home, he isn\u2019t really present. He spends his nights hunched at his desk, poring over reports until the early hours of morning when the sun begins to rise. Only then does he crawl into bed with Draco and steal a few hours of sleep. </p>\n<p>Draco offers what support he can in the way of sympathetic words and gentle touches. It physically pains him to see Harry like this. His own job as a part-time Brewer in a local Potions shop is markedly stress-free, and he has few words of wisdom to offer Harry on this matter. </p>\n<p>One night, maybe three weeks into this new routine, Draco comes home from work to find Harry passed out at his desk. Dead asleep with his mouth hanging open, cheek pressed uncomfortably against a stack of books, a quill still gripped loosely in his slack hand. He looks beyond exhausted. The last thing Draco wants to do is wake him, but he knows if he doesn\u2019t Harry will be upset. Clearly, he hasn\u2019t meant to fall asleep at his desk.</p>\n<p>Draco tiptoes around the stacks of books and parchments scattered throughout the small office, making his way toward Harry\u2019s sleeping form. Bending down, he presses a gentle kiss against the man\u2019s jaw, the skin scratchy with unshaven whiskers.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey,\u201d he murmurs in Harry\u2019s ear. \u201cWake up. If you\u2019re going to sleep, you should do it in a bed.\u201d </p>\n<p>Glossy eyes open to meet his own. \u201cWhas- wrong?\u201d Harry slurs, still half asleep. </p>\n<p>\u201cShh,\u201d Draco soothes, rubbing his shoulder reassuringly. \u201cYou\u2019re fine. You fell asleep at your desk.\u201d </p>\n<p>Harry lifts his head, neck cracking in a way that has Draco wincing. \u201cWhy are you home? What time is it?\u201d Harry asks, rubbing the sleep from his eyes. </p>\n<p>Draco frowns. \u201cIt\u2019s past five. I just Apparated back from work.\u201d </p>\n<p>Harry\u2019s hands fall from his face. \u201cOh, fuck!\u201d he exclaims loudly, startling Draco. \u201cI was supposed to take over stakeout for Hoffman at four!\u201d </p>\n<p>Harry shoots upright from his desk in a blind panic. Draco is entirely unprepared for what happens next. One moment, Harry is hastily gathering a stack of parchments from his desk. In the next second, his face turns a sickly shade of puce. Eyes rolling up in his head, he goes suddenly limp, parchment scattering from his hands as his body crumples bonelessly in a dead faint.</p>\n<p>Draco\u2019s arms shoot out instinctively. He narrowly catches the man\u2019s limp body before his head cracks on the side of the desk. </p>\n<p>\u201cShite!\u201d Draco swears loudly, sinking shakily to the floor with Harry\u2019s dead weight clutched against his chest. \u201cOh, fuck. Harry. <em>Harry!\"</em></p>\n<p>He shakes Harry\u2019s shoulders in a desperate attempt to rouse him, but the only thing this accomplishes is making the man\u2019s limp head flop sickeningly back and forth. \u201cFuck!\u201d Draco swears again, panic rapidly mounting. \u201cDammit, Harry! Fuck sake! Wake up!\u201d He slaps Harry roughly across the cheek, nearly upsetting his glasses from his face, entirely outside his element and at a loss for what to do. </p>\n<p>Thankfully, that seems to do the trick. A low moan sounds from Harry\u2019s limp form. A moment later, his head shifts against Draco\u2019s chest. Bleary green eyes crack open, unseeing and unfocused. </p>\n<p>\u201cOh, thank fucking Merlin,\u201d Draco breathes, going practically dizzy with relief. \u201cOh fuck, Harry. Merlin\u2019s balls. Can you hear me?\u201d </p>\n<p>Another moan. Harry opens his eyes fully now, looking terribly dazed as he returns to gradual consciousness. \u201cWhat-?\u201d he asks, voice trailing off. Feverish eyes meet his own and Harry\u2019s brow furrows in obvious confusion. \u201cDraco? What happened?\u201d </p>\n<p>Harry pushes against his chest with shaky hands, struggling to sit upright. Draco hisses and tightens his hold on the man. \u201cNo- stop <em>moving!</em> Stay still for a bloody moment, will you? You passed out.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI did?\u201d Harry asks, ceasing his attempts to move and settling back against Draco\u2019s chest with an unhappy frown. \u201cI don\u2019t remember.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cShite, Harry,\u201d Draco groans, burying his face in the other man\u2019s hair. \u201cYou feel alright now? You scared me half to death.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry frowns, considering the question. \u201cFine. Little dizzy. Bit of a headache,\u201d he admits grudgingly. \u201cCan I sit up now?\u201d </p>\n<p>Draco grunts and helps Harry sit upright from the floor, leaning him back to rest against his desk. \u201cStay there a minute,\u201d Draco insists when the man goes to move again. He notes unhappily that Harry still appears far too pale, forehead and hair soaked with sweat, green eyes dull and rimmed with dark circles.</p>\n<p>\u201cBut I need to get to work,\u201d Harry insists with a grimace, rubbing his forehead with a shaky hand. \u201cHoffman-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCan fucking wait,\u201d Draco interrupts, voice tight with worry. He digs his wand from his robe pocket and casts a mindless freshening charm on Harry, drying his sweat-dampened clothes and hair. He pauses for a long moment, wand still raised, considering something. </p>\n<p>\u201cWhen\u2019s the last time you drank anything?\u201d </p>\n<p>Harry pauses, looking a bit taken aback by the sudden question. \u201cUm-\u201d he muses, forehead creasing in contemplation. \u201cI can\u2019t remember.\u201d </p>\n<p>Draco waves his wand and casts a hydrating charm on Harry. Instantly, the man\u2019s eyes loose some of their glassy sheen and he sits upright a bit more easily. \u201cOh,\u201d Harry says simply, looking a bit startled. \u201cHeadache\u2019s gone.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cWhen did you last eat?\u201d </p>\n<p>Harry slowly turns his head to meet Draco\u2019s intense stare. \u201cI- I\u2019m not sure,\u201d he admits, looking a bit stunned by this confession. \u201cYesterday breakfast, maybe?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFuck, Harry,\u201d Draco swears, stomach twisting horribly. <em>\"Yesterday?\"</em></p>\n<p>Harry winces. \u201cI think.\u201d </p>\n<p>Draco\u2019s chest feels unnaturally heavy. \u201cFor fuck sake,\u201d he snaps, worry making his temper short. \u201cYou can\u2019t just <em>decide not to eat</em> for over an entire bloody day! No matter how busy you are!\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry\u2019s eyes grow wide with distress. \u201cShite,\u201d he mumbles, more to himself than Draco. \u201cI forgot.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cForgot what? To eat?\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry nods, the gesture small and uncertain. \u201cHappens once in awhile,\u201d he admits quietly. \u201cWhen I\u2019m really busy, or stressed. I forget about eating.\u201d </p>\n<p>Draco stares at the other man incredulously. \u201cHow do you just <em>forget to eat</em> for practically two days?\u201d </p>\n<p>Harry shrugs helplessly, looking abashed. \u201cI never feel hungry. I just eat when I\u2019m supposed to. I\u2019m usually really good at remembering, though. This hasn\u2019t happened in a long time.\u201d </p>\n<p>All at once, Draco feels physically ill, and all of Harry\u2019s strange, food-related obsessions make sudden, terrible sense.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou don\u2019t feel hungry? Ever?\u201d Draco clarifies, dread settling like lead in his stomach. </p>\n<p>Harry\u2019s eyes meet his own and he seems to realize what he has inadvertently confessed. \u201cNot really,\u201d he says slowly, expression carefully guarded. </p>\n<p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Draco voices the obvious question when Harry does not volunteer further information. </p>\n<p>Harry leans his head back against the desk. \u201cDunno. I\u2019ve seen Healers about it in the past. Nothing\u2019s physically wrong with me, I just-\u201d his voice cuts off as he frowns deeply. He stares fixedly at the ground, and his next words come out slowly, as though carefully chosen. \u201cWell. I think it\u2019s probably because I was so used to feeling hungry as a child. I learned to suppress it. So I don\u2019t feel it, even now, unless I really, really think about it. Sort of a bad habit, I guess.\u201d </p>\n<p>Internally, Draco is screaming. He wonders detachedly if his face looks as horrified as he feels. His mind races with a million frenzied questions. <em>Why the fuck is suppressing your hunger a habit? What do you mean by \u2018even now\u2019? Why were you used to feeling hungry as a child? What the fuck happened to you? </em></p>\n<p>But he voices none of these thoughts aloud upon seeing Harry\u2019s face. </p>\n<p>The man slowly raises his head, turning to look Draco directly in the face. His skin is ashen, teeth clenched, eyes wild and shiny with unconcealed panic. </p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d Harry says simply. His voice is uncharacteristically high-pitched and unsteady. \u201cDon\u2019t ask. Please.\u201d </p>\n<p>And in that moment, Draco knows. He knows that all his deep-rooted suspicions about Harry\u2019s childhood are terribly, horribly true. </p>\n<p>But he doesn\u2019t ask. </p>\n<p>Instead, he reaches slowly toward Harry and guides the man\u2019s crumpled face into the crook of his neck, pulling him into a firm, steady embrace. \u201cOk,\" he whispers the promise in Harry\u2019s ear. \u201cOk. I won\u2019t.\u201d </p>\n<p>Harry\u2019s body begins to tremble uncontrollably and his breaths turn into shaky pants that tickle Draco\u2019s neck. He simply holds the man tighter in response, remaining silent though he wants nothing more than to shout and rage and voice his unthinkable thoughts aloud and confirm what he knows in his heart to be true. But he knows that this is what Harry needs in this moment. Quiet support and carefully maintained control. </p>\n<p>They sit huddled together on the floor for an indefinite amount of time. Until Harry\u2019s shaking body stills and his breathing evens out and Draco\u2019s knees throb from where they\u2019ve been kneeling on the wood floor for far too long. But he still doesn't ask. </p>\n<p>Finally, Harry is the first to pull away. Taking a single shuddering breath, he squares his shoulders and doesn\u2019t quite meet Draco\u2019s eyes when he looks him in the face.</p>\n<p>\u201cI should leave. Hoffman\u2019s probably beside himself by now.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Draco says unthinkingly, mind curiously numb. \u201cNo. You\u2019re not going anywhere except straight to bed. After you eat something. Merlin, Harry. You\u2019ll just collapse again if you go into work now.\u201d </p>\n<p>Harry looks as though he\u2019s going to argue for a minute. But something in Draco\u2019s expression must make him give pause, because in the next moment, he visibly deflates. \u201cYeah, alright,\u201d he agrees reluctantly. \u201cI\u2019ll eat. And rest. But only for a few hours.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cFine,\u201d Draco agrees tersely, mentally resolving to cancel any alarm spells Harry might set. The Ministry can go fuck themselves. The other Aurors can run the damn investigation themselves for a bloody change. Harry needs tonight for himself. \u201cI\u2019ll owl Hoffman,\u201d Draco offers, helping Harry rise from the ground when the man goes to stand. </p>\n<p>\u201cOk,\u201d Harry agrees, looking half-dead on his feet. </p>\n<p>Draco remains nearby until he\u2019s fairly certain the other man isn\u2019t going to faint again. \u201cYou alright to make it to bed?\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cYes, Mother,\u201d Harry deadpans, though the joke is halfhearted at best. \u201cReally, Draco. I\u2019m fine,\u201d he insists more seriously when Draco continues to stare and hover pointedly. </p>\n<p>Draco grunts in response. \u201cI\u2019ll bring you something to eat. Go,\u201d he insists, giving Harry a gentle nudge between his shoulder blades. </p>\n<p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Harry murmurs, catching his gaze and stroking a hand up and down Draco\u2019s arm before turning and walking out the room. His tone is casual, but his lingering touch and haunted eyes betray the depth and true meaning behind his gratitude. </p>\n<p>Draco stands unmoving for a long minute, listening to the quiet rustles from next door as Harry disrobes and gets into bed. He feels strangely detached from his body. He can hear his heartbeat in his ears. The walls seem to warp and vibrate around him if he looks too closely. His thoughts both race and stand still, inexplicably all at once. He wants to scream. He wants to cry. <em>Oh Harry.</em> </p>\n<p>Harry. He can't do this right now. Harry needs him. And so, for the first time in over six years, Draco occludes. He closes his eyes and pushes his emotions and fears and horror deep, deep down and raises his Occlumency shields to full force. Harry. Harry needs him. Draco needs to maintain some semblance of control. And this is the only way he knows how to do it. </p>\n<p>Draco goes through the motions of sending a letter of explanation to Hoffman. He makes several cold-cut sandwiches. Wakes Harry briefly and forces him to eat before he passes out again. Dims the lights and dutifully cancels Harry\u2019s alarm spells. Mindlessly showers and shaves and brushes his teeth. Curls up next to Harry\u2019s still body in the quiet of their bedroom. Pulls the bedcovers up to his ears when he notices him shivering in his sleep. Reaches out a tentative arm and pulls Harry's body flush against his chest. Breathes in the man's familiar scent and presses himself against comfortingly solid lines and muscles. </p>\n<p>He traces patterns on Harry's bare back once he's certain the man is in a deep sleep. He hesitantly touches those terrible, godawful scars; lightly, so as not to wake Harry, fingertips barely ghosting against naked skin. </p>\n<p>And only then, under the safety of darkness, does Draco allow his shields to falter and his mind to wander and his tears to inevitably fall.</p>"
