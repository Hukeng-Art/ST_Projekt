Today we\u2019re talking about all the flaws in the heroics system.</p>\n<p>I\u2019ve made an itemized list. It\u2019s 33 points long. If that\u2019s too much for you, the tl:dr is as following: heroics has turned into a popularity contest and a political game instead of a system where heroes focus on helping people.</p>\n<p>Here goes.</p>\n<p>\n<u>Read more</u>\n</p>\n<p><strong>FlowersInBloom<br></strong>Hey, are we gonna talk about the fact that this is the <em>Number One Hero</em> speaking about how the hero system is messed up?</p>\n<p>I feel like we need to talk about it.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>SparksFly<br></strong>Oh.

When you\u2019re friends with Deku, you get used to a dizzying mix of both.</p>\n<p>Anyways, hey, yes! This is a big thing that\u2019s going on! The graduated class of 3A has been talking about it for years and only got away with our licenses because we were such big name heroes. Didn\u2019t stop the censors from deleting the content, though. Are we trying to stop the whole system? It\u2019s nice but unrealistic, and before you start claiming that we want to keep profiting from the industry, please remember that heroics is the <em>only</em> current system for first-responders, crisis management, and disaster relief. Even if villains disappear overnight (<em>also</em> nice but unrealistic, might I point you to some of the essays <em>@AnalysisOverload</em>\u2019s\u00a0been posting for years), we can\u2019t pull heroics without good infrastructure that\u2019s ready to go.</p>\n<p>This is probably a good time to mention said infrastructure! And no, it\u2019s not a wild shot in the dark or a risky plan without payoff. We\u2019re starting to see real traction in the legal system, and related censorship is going down, too. Here\u2019s several good places to start:</p>\n<p>https://TimeForChange.org/QuirkActivism</p>\n<p>https://GovTracker.Japan.com/quirk-rights/all</p>\n<p>https://ShiningChildren.org/infrastructure-initiatives</p>\n<p>https://MutantsInMemoriam.ja.gov</p>\n<p>tldr: to all the people saying \u201c3A took down the League and All for One before the graduated, what are they doing with their lives now?\u201d This. We\u2019re doing this. Get on board or get out of the way, because things are about to move very, very fast.</p>\n<p>\n<em>#Izuku reblog this after your HeroConX panel ok? #speaking of which #the biggest person driving a Quirk-Quirkless-inclusive HeroCon?

And sure, it sent the whole crowd crazy whenever he came to his panel in cosplay, particularly since several dozen of them had interacted with him throughout the con.\u00a0</p>\n<p>But Izuku knew it was important for his fans to get to interact with him, not as some untouchable Number One, but as a equal fan. And today\u2014today was going to be different.</p>\n<p>Today, his cosplay as a Quirkless person was going to draw many of the questions that were always left on the cutting room floor of any interview he did.</p>\n<p>Today, there was going to be a reckoning\u2014a fierce one, a kind one, a necessary one.</p>\n<p>There was a roar, giant to the point of vast, as he stepped onstage. The lights went blinding for endless seconds, sweeping across the stage, before fading back.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He had requested, from his very first hero con, that the lights never be bright enough to make it so he couldn\u2019t see everyone in the audience. The people were, after all, why he was there.</p>\n<p>The roar slowly died off, tinged with confusion and chatter. Izuku knew full well why. In all his years, he had never cosplayed as anyone other than a hero.</p>\n<p>\u201cHi, everyone,\u201d he called out, clicking on the handheld microphone. \u201cI guess you\u2019re wondering why I cosplayed as a Quirkless person.\u201d</p>\n<p>And the roar was back.</p>\n<p>Izuku settled more firmly in his skin and waited for it to quiet off.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAs I\u2019m sure many of you know,\u201d he said, projecting his voice to the very back corners, \u201cthis hero con is about acceptance and inclusion. I know from personal experience that one of the hardest things to do is include people who aren\u2019t like us. Let me tell you something the media companies wish I wouldn\u2019t share.\u201d</p>\n<p>A buzz. Izuku had framed his words like a scandal, and everyone wanted to be the first to hear it.</p>\n<p>Deep breath in. Deep breath out. Make eye contact with as many people as possible.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cMy first year on the job, there was something I brought up in every interview I did. In every case, it never made it to the final broadcast. I could have done this on live TV, but that always ran the risk of the interviewer dismissing the subject. I\u2019ve been waiting for a time to talk about this where I have full control of the conversation. Are you ready?\u201d</p>\n<p>An affirmative shout.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI was Quirkless until right before UA,\u201d he said, and the room went still. \u201cI know what it\u2019s like to be a societal reject, and I\u2019m making sure that we don\u2019t make people feel unwanted going forward.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Now, to break the script completely.</p>\n<p>\u201cCan I talk for a moment?\u201d he asked, dropping his voice into something quieter, something softer, letting the microphone do all the hard work of projecting his voice. \u201cCan I talk as Midoriya Izuku instead of Deku?\u201d</p>\n<p>A hush, stronger than the roar, settled in.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt was really hard, growing up Quirkless,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople don\u2019t believe in you very much, not when you don\u2019t have a superpower.\u201d He took a breath. It shook only a little. \u201cI knew I wanted to be a hero from really early on. At first, I just wanted to be like All Might. Don\u2019t we all?\u201d A laugh, quickly cut off, circled the room.</p>\n<p>\u201cBut then,\u201d Izuku said, \u201cI found I wanted to be a hero because I saw that there were a lot of people hurting, like me. Some of them were Quirkless. Some of them weren\u2019t. Truth is, you can have any sort of Quirk and still be hurting. I wanted to help all the hurting people, and so I said I\u2019d become a hero. That is my mission in life, to help people. I wanted to come here today to say that helping people is so important, and you don\u2019t have to be a hero to do it. There\u2019s\u2014there\u2019s this myth, that you can only do cool, important stuff if you\u2019re a hero. That\u2019s not true. Some of the best people I know aren\u2019t heroes to anyone except for me.\u201d</p>\n<p>He was tearing up, now. He had enough practice leashing it that he could have suppressed it, but he didn\u2019t. People needed to see that this was important to him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI brought one of my best friends, Jazz, with me today. She\u2019s amazing. She\u2019s wise and she\u2019s brave and she\u2019s willing to face the world with kindness. She\u2019s also Quirkless.\u201d</p>\n<p>Chatter, now. People started twisting in their chairs, looking for Jazz. Izuku could barely see her from here, hands hiding her face, shoulders shaking.</p>\n<p>\u201cI want people to know that your Quirk doesn\u2019t determine your worth. Not even your actions determine your worth. You are all worth so, so much.\u201d Tears rolled down his face, quiet and determined. \u201cEvery last one of you is worth the world. That\u2019s what I came here to say. Thank you.\u201d</p>\n<p>He met Jazz\u2019s eyes above the crowd.</p>\n<p>And her smile was like daylight.</p>"
