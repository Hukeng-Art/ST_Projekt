  "text": "<p>\u201cPeter, can you stay for a moment?\u201d Ms Warren calls out as students start rushing out of the class, and Peter shoots Ned a nervous look, his mind immediately reeling. Had he done something wrong recently? He doesn\u2019t think so. He hadn\u2019t been absent from any classes for two weeks now, had only been late a few minutes like three times, and his physics assignment had been overdue only a day. He\u2019d apologised for that!</p>\n<p>Ned gives him a questioning look, and Peter shrugs helplessly.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll wait for you at your locker,\u201d Ned says quietly, patting Peter on the arm before leaving the classroom.</p>\n<p>When Peter steps up to the teacher\u2019s desk, Ms Warren smiles at him, and so he feels himself relax a little.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo, Peter, I have heard claims about you having an internship at Stark Industries,\u201d she starts, and folds her hands on the desk, \u201cand I wanted to ask you if that\u2019s really true. If it isn\u2019t, you don\u2019t have to lie to me, just be honest.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter nods, slightly confused as to why his teacher would ask, and just slightly hurt that even <em> she </em>is doubting Peter\u2019s truthfulness (although, logically, of course Peter knows that a 16-year-old claiming to intern at one of the world\u2019s largest companies doesn\u2019t exactly scream believable).</p>\n<p>\u201cI do intern there, it\u2019s not a lie. I have papers to prove it and everything, I\u2019m on record,\u201d he rushes to assure, fidgeting with the straps of his backpack and feeling even more confused when Ms Warren raises a calming hand.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey, relax, I believe you,\u201d she smiles, stopping Peter, \u201cI was hoping that\u2019d be the case.\u201d</p>\n<p>Warren makes a little pause, looking at Peter thoughtfully.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou know, we still have a field trip to go on with your science class. I\u2019ve been looking into different options, but Stark Industries is undeniably one of the best learning experiences you lot could have. But it\u2019s not easy to get a tour there on such a short notice. I was just thinking, if it\u2019s not too much trouble, maybe you could ask around? If you can\u2019t or don\u2019t want to, that\u2019s fine, but I figured asking wouldn\u2019t hurt, right?\u201d</p>\n<p>Of all the possible scenarios, this was <em> not </em> what Peter expected, so he gapes for about three seconds before realizing that Ms Warren is expecting an answer.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, uh,\u201d Peter stammers awkwardly, eyes wide as golf balls, \u201cI mean, I can\u2019t promise anything, but sure, I can ask someone if there\u2019s any chance something could be arranged.\u201d</p>\n<p>Ms Warren gives him a wide smile.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Peter isn\u2019t worried because he thinks Tony won\u2019t say yes, he\u2019s worried because he\u2019s sure Tony will. And he\u2019s not sure how he feels about having his entire class waltzing around the place where he spends practically more time than in his own home, where he has his own room, and where he regularly eats Lucky Charms with one of the most influential men in the country, in his pajamas. Not that they\u2019d ever know any of that. Tour groups don\u2019t go to the living quarters of the Tower anyways, they hardly ever go past the 50th floor, Peter knows that. And it isn\u2019t fair to his class if he doesn\u2019t ask just because he\u2026spends a lot of time there?</p>\n<p>Yeah, Peter sighs, he has to ask. He promised, anyways.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Peter\u2019s not exactly sure how he should approach the topic but he hopes he\u2019ll figure it out on the go.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey, Mr Stark?\u201d he says the next evening, when Tony is elbow-deep in a mess of bolts and screws and wires, and Peter\u2019s decided he\u2019s fiddled with his web-shooters enough for now. The release mechanism is still a bit wonky because he just reassembled it, but he can fix it later.</p>\n<p>Tony looks over to him, a smear of motor oil on his cheek and a glint in his eyes.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat did you do this time, Spiderling?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat? Nothing! Why would you think I did something?\u201d Peter defensively exclaims, forgetting his field trip troubles for a moment. Tony straightens his back, pulling his arm out of the machinery and rests his hands on his hips. His hands are stained with black, and Peter is sure they\u2019re smearing the shirt Tony\u2019s wearing, but Tony has never cared about getting his clothes dirty in the lab. The smell of motor oil has become one of the core things that Peter associates with Tony Stark, faint traces of it seem to be along with him even when he\u2019s in snazzy suits that have never even seen the substance, wearing fancy cologne that probably costs more than anything Peter owns combined (that Tony hasn\u2019t bought him). It\u2019s a part of him. The smell of motor oil relaxes Peter.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t called me Mr Stark in months, kiddo. We\u2019re like, way past that. I can only assume you\u2019re in trouble somehow.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, no, I\u2019m good. This is just a Mr Stark question, not a Tony question,\u201d Peter laughs, and the uncertainty he felt has subsided remarkably. Tony leans on the table in front of him and the corner of his mouth twitches.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh? We\u2019re talking business now, are we? Alright, shoot.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSomething like that. And you don\u2019t have to say yes! It\u2019s just, um, my class is yet to go on a field trip this year, and my science teacher knows I\u2019m an intern at SI so I kind of, uh, promised her that I\u2019d ask\u2026\u201d Peter trails off, and Tony raises an eyebrow but his face remains fond.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat you\u2019d ask whether your class could get a field trip here?\u201d he finishes for Peter, taking on a full grin now.</p>\n<p>\u201cLike I said, you don\u2019t have to say yes,\u201d Peter reminds him, picking at a thread on his sleeve out of habit more than anything.</p>\n<p>\u201cFRIDAY, send an email to the principal of Midtown High informing him that Peter\u2019s class is invited to a 9:00 tour of Stark Industries next Friday. And arrange the tour so they actually have a guide when they get here,\u201d Tony says instead, looking up at the ceiling where the speakers are.</p>\n<p>\u201cRight away, boss,\u201d FRIDAY\u2019s voice responds from above.</p>\n<p>\u201cThanks, FRI. Now, of course your class can get a field trip to SI, Pete, this can be a simple Tony question,\u201d Tony says to Peter again, turning his gaze back to him. Peter rubs the back of his neck.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, well\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd by the way, I\u2019m proud of you,\u201d Tony adds, ignoring the teenager\u2019s stammering and smiling at the surprised look that replaces the embarrassed one.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re- What for?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re actually asking stuff from me. Back when we first started this whole mentorship thing you would have rather jumped off a Quinjet than asked me for anything. I\u2019m glad we\u2019re past that, is all. That you\u2019re comfortable enough to do that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, I didn\u2019t - I <em> don\u2019t </em> - want you to think I\u2019m taking advantage or-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with taking some advantage of the fact that you have the actual Tony Stark?\u201d Tony grins cockily, ruffling the kid\u2019s hair.</p>\n<p>\u201cBut it\u2019s not about the things that you can offer me! If you lost everything tomorrow, I would still keep coming to you, because of <em> you </em> , because <em> you </em>\u2019re important to me!\u201d Peter presses on, like it\u2019s very important to him that Tony understands that, and Tony\u2019s chest swells with warmth.</p>\n<p>\u201cI know, kiddo. Love you too.\u201d</p>\n<p>They fall into a comfortable silence for a few moments, before Peter\u2019s poorly concealed giggle breaks it.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Tony asks, amused.</p>\n<p>\u201cNothing, it\u2019s just- You have dirty motor oil on your cheek.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah? So do you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t- <em> hey! </em>\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter lets out a shriek when Tony smears his hand over the entire half of Peter\u2019s face, and Tony laughs.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Ned punches his arm when Peter tells him the next day.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo way,\u201d he whispers, eyes as wide as dinner plates, \u201cPeter, that is <em> so cool! </em>You got us a field trip to Stark Industries? Flash is gonna explode!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t want everyone to know it was me,\u201d Peter says quickly, as they make their way to the science class before the start of the lesson, so Peter could tell Ms Warren that same thing before the teacher announces the trip. Ned casts him a confused look.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy not? That would show them! Flash has been blaming you for lying since last year.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter shakes his head, looking around on instinct to scan for Flash.</p>\n<p>\u201cI just don\u2019t want them to know. I wasn\u2019t really into the idea of asking Tony anyways. And Flash isn\u2019t going to stop harassing me just because Ms Warren says I was the one who got it for us. It doesn\u2019t really matter. Who says that we wouldn\u2019t have gotten it anyways, the normal way.\u201d</p>\n<p>Ned gives him a semi-understanding smile, resting his hand on Peter\u2019s shoulder for a moment, and Peter knows he doesn\u2019t really get it 100 percent, but he\u2019s trying to, and he\u2019s supporting Peter anyways, and that\u2019s enough.</p>\n<p>When they make it to the class, it\u2019s thankfully still empty besides Ms Warren. Ms Warren stands up as soon as she sees the boys, her face overcome with astonishment.</p>\n<p>\u201cHi, Ned! Peter! The principal forwarded me an email last night from Stark Industries with the offer of a company tour. I- Wow, I can\u2019t thank you enough. I hope you didn\u2019t have to pull too many strings to get that kind of offer for us so soon?\u201d she says earnestly, clasping Peter\u2019s shoulder, and Peter shakes his head quickly. He\u2019s still not particularly <em> happy </em> about the field trip\u2026 but the woman\u2019s sincere gratitude and concern makes him feel like maybe it\u2019s not so bad after all.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, no, it\u2019s okay. Actually I wanted to ask if you could maybe, uh, not mention the fact that it was me who got it for us?\u201d</p>\n<p>Ms Warren looks surprised at that, and Peter\u2019s quick to elaborate.</p>\n<p>\u201cI just don\u2019t want any extra attention on me or anything,\u201d he settles on saying, and thankfully, Ms Warren nods.</p>\n<p>\u201cAlright, if you\u2019re sure.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAlso, is it possible that I meet you at SI next week instead of taking the bus?\u201d Peter goes on to ask. Tony had suggested that, saying that Pete\u2019s at the Tower on Thursday anyways, May has a late night shift as well, and it\u2019d be easier and more convenient if he just spent the night there and went to the lobby to meet his class when the field trip started.</p>\n<p>He can\u2019t say exactly that, though.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m uh, I\u2019m spending the night at a friend\u2019s place who lives really close to the Stark Tower because I have an internship project that I\u2019ve been working on so I\u2019m staying late, and it\u2019d be kinda pointless to come to school from near the Tower only to take a bus to go right back,\u201d he explains instead, threading on half-truths. Well, they\u2019re pretty big half-truths, he tells himself. He <em> is </em> staying late, and he probably <em> will </em> be working on something. And Tony, well, to call him a friend feels too shallow, too superficial, because he\u2019s <em> so much </em> more than that, but he is, undeniably, also a friend.</p>\n<p>Ms Warren looks uncertain for a moment, but eventually nods.</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay, I don\u2019t see why not. But I\u2019m still going to need the permission slip signed by your Aunt. Formalities. And also a written statement from her that she knows you\u2019re meeting up with us there.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, sure.\u201d</p>\n<p>Students start coming into class one by one because the break is ending in a few minutes, and Peter goes to his seat next to Ned.</p>\n<p>The rest of the class passes as normal. Which means, Flash not-so-accidentally shoves Peter\u2019s book off of his desk with his bag when he passes them, Ned shows him Spider-Man videos under the desk when they\u2019ve finished their in-class assignments, and there\u2019s an occasional crumpled up paper flying at his head from one of Flash\u2019s goons that Peter can feel coming but forces himself not to dodge.</p>\n<p>Only when the lesson is nearing its end is there a change in routine.</p>\n<p>\u201cAlright, everyone,\u201d Ms Warren claps his hands once to get their attention, and waits for everyone to quiet down before continuing.</p>\n<p>\u201cBefore you all go, I have an announcement to make. As most of you may have noticed, we still have a field trip to go on, and I\u2019m happy to say we can check that box real soon. Next Friday, we are going on a field trip to Stark Industries.\u201d</p>\n<p>The effect is immediate, with excited chatter blowing up almost on the moment, and Flash turns around in his seat to lock eyes with Peter and give him a shark-like grin.</p>\n<p>\u201cEverybody grab a permission slip on your way out. You know the drill, they have to be signed by a parent or a guardian, and I want them back by next Wednesday. The bus leaves from in front of the school gates at 8AM next Friday, don\u2019t be late.\u201d</p>\n<p>Flash catches Peter on the way to the lockers, and slings an arm over his shoulders.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo, wanna come clean before next Friday, Parker?\u201d he sneers, looking extremely delighted with the current events, and Ned looks at Peter almost beggingly, but Peter secretly shakes his head, \u201cC\u2019mon. Your fake internship is going to be exposed at Stark Industries anyway. I\u2019ll even give you a pass just this once. Just admit that you were lying now and I\u2019ll let it slide. One-time offer, Penis.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShut up, Flash, he\u2019s not lying,\u201d Ned snaps at him, annoyed, and Flash sighs, rolling his eyes and shaking his head.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhatever, losers. It\u2019s almost sad how committed you are to keeping this up. Enjoy what little time you have before the field trip, because you\u2019re gonna get what\u2019s coming to you then, and everyone will know for sure what a liar you are. Just saying, it\u2019s probably illegal to spread lies claiming to be an SI intern when you\u2019re not.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFor the record, I haven\u2019t been spreading anything, you have,\u201d Peter responds, annoyed, but Flash was already gone. Ned shakes his head, and looks at Peter in sympathy.</p>\n<p>\u201cJust wait 'til he learns.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter nods, and they make their way to the lockers.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHey, May!\u201d Peter calls out when he gets home, and the smell of pizza greets him on the door.</p>\n<p>\u201cHi, honey! How was school?\u201d May answers from the living room, and Peter kicks off his shoes and goes to sit next to her, dropping the backpack next to the couch. He gives her a sideways hug with one arm and grabs a slice of pizza with the other.</p>\n<p>\u201cFine,\u201d he shrugs, fishing the permission slip out of his bag and handing it to her. May reads over it, and gives him a smile when she looks up.</p>\n<p>\u201cA trip to Stark Industries, huh? That sounds fun. Does Tony know?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, he arranged it,\u201d Peter says, chewing on a bite of pizza before going on, \u201cYou\u2019re on a late shift on Thursdays, so we were thinking I could spend the night there and meet up with the class on site instead of going to school. Ms Warren said it\u2019s fine if you write a note that you know this and are okay with it.\u201d \u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course, that makes sense,\u201d May agrees, and they spend the rest of the night watching Star Wars. When Peter gets up for school next morning, the signed permission slip and May\u2019s note to the teacher are both on the kitchen table, along with a yellow sticky note wishing him to have a good day at school today. There\u2019s a smiley face after it. Peter grins.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The time left before the field trip flies by very fast, and before Peter knows it, it\u2019s Thursday night and he, Tony, and Pepper are all gathered at the dining table. Peter\u2019s shoveling lasagna into his mouth like he hasn\u2019t eaten in years, and Tony laughs while Pepper\u2019s lips are tugged into a fond smile.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis is a pro-breathing household, kiddo. Slow down.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut it\u2019s so good!\u201d</p>\n<p>It\u2019s not all that often that they all have dinner together, because oftentimes Tony gets caught up in his lab, or Pepper is busy, or something or other, so when Peter stays for dinner he usually either eats with Tony, or with Pepper. But he loves it when it\u2019s all of them. It feels like home. It <em> is </em> home, but if feels extra homey then.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat time did your tour start tomorrow?\u201d Tony asks, taking a sip of orange juice, and throws Peter a paper napkin, eyes sparkling with warmth when it harmlessly whacks Peter in the face. \u201cYou have tomato paste on your nose. And cheek. You know what, just wipe your whole face.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay, <em> dad </em>,\u201d Peter sticks out his tongue at Tony, and drags the napkin over his face.</p>\n<p>\u201cWatch the attitude or you\u2019re grounded, kid,\u201d Tony responds almost immediately, amused. Peter snorts.</p>\n<p>\u201cI gotta be down at 9AM. Are you gonna show up at some point?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, you can bet on it,\u201d Tony grins, and Peter looks to Pepper in pretended desperation. Pepper laughs.</p>\n<p>\u201cJust, this is my <em> class </em>. You can\u2019t be a Tony, you have to be a Mr Stark.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo promises, kiddie.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Next morning Peter is waiting in the lobby at 8:40 to already be there when his class arrives. He\u2019s leaning against the reception desk, bunching up the excess fabric of his jacket sleeves in his hands as he waits. Before coming down he couldn\u2019t find his sweatshirt, and he didn\u2019t want to be late to being early so he grabbed this first thing that he happened upon, which was this dark grey zipper hoodie on the back of a bar stool in the kitchen. There\u2019s a Stark Industries logo on its back, and just <em> Stark </em> written on the front-left in simplistic white letters, so Peter can take an educated guess as to who its owner is. Besides, it smells like a mix of Tony\u2019s aftershave and, of course, motor oil (that Peter is fairly sure only his enhanced senses can detect, but it\u2019s there). It\u2019d be big enough for him to warrant some curious glances from others, but he keeps the front open and that way the size is not so obvious, and the <em> Stark </em> on the chest is less likely to be noticed as well.</p>\n<p>A young woman in a white lab coat comes up next to him, and Peter thinks he\u2019s seen her around a few times. She\u2019s carrying a see-through plastic box, and Peter can see a lot of visitor badges in it. The woman sees him looking, and smiles at him, eyes lighting up in recognition.</p>\n<p>\u201cPeter Parker, right?\u201d she asks, and Peter nods. \u201cYou\u2019re the brilliant intern who everyone loves to work with. Everyone says it\u2019s a good day when you\u2019re around.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter chuckles, cheeks heating up for a moment.</p>\n<p>\u201cI suppose I get along with everyone. I\u2019m so sorry, I know I\u2019ve seen you but I can\u2019t remember your name.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, it\u2019s fine, I\u2019ve probably never introduced myself to you. I\u2019m Kate Layberg. Anyways, what\u2019s holding you up? You\u2019re not usually down here, are you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019m just waiting for my class to arrive, we have a tour today, starts at 9,\u201d Peter shrugs, and Kate raises an eyebrow.</p>\n<p>\u201cMidtown High?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI- Yeah.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt seems I\u2019m your tour guide then,\u201d Kate smiles.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s then that a rowdy mass of students pushes itself through the doors, hushing in awe as soon as they get inside, and Peter can hear gasps and gaping all the way to his place. He can\u2019t really blame them, he\u2019s been where they are. The interior design of just the reception area is elegant, sleek, and high-tech, and makes you feel like you\u2019ve stepped some 50 years into the future. Everything just screams <em> Stark </em>.</p>\n<p>Peter catches Ned\u2019s eye first, grinning at his friend\u2019s amazed expression, and Ms Warren\u2019s next, nodding at the teacher\u2019s greeting gesture.</p>\n<p>\u201cGood morning, Peter. Okay, now we\u2019ve got everyone who was supposed to come,\u201d she says when they\u2019re within hearing range. Peter falls into place next to Ned.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey! This is all so cool,\u201d Ned enthuses in a hushed voice, staring around with sparkling eyes before turning to Peter again, \u201cand is that <em> Tony Stark\u2019s </em> jacket you\u2019re wearing? Dude, oh my god!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI was in a rush,\u201d Peter shrugs, but before Ned can say anything, his face falls. Peter can feel his spidey-sense warning him before he feels the nudge on his shoulder.</p>\n<p>\u201cWow, Penis, I\u2019m almost impressed,\u201d Flash says in a low enough voice not to alert the teachers, sporting a raised eyebrow, \u201cSo you didn\u2019t duck out of the trip to not face your doom after all.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI told you in the bus Peter would be waiting for us here,\u201d Ned says, annoyed, and Flash rolls his eyes.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd why would I have believed that? Anyways, I\u2019m happy you\u2019re here,\u201d he says, an unkind grin appearing on his face, \u201cI want to see the look on your face when all your lies get dragged into the daylight.\u201d</p>\n<p>Before either of them can answer, Flash is already going, and Kate speaks up, effectively silencing the group.</p>\n<p>\u201cAlright, good morning, Midtown! My name is Kate Layberg and I\u2019m your tour guide today. Before we start, you all need to get your badges. They serve as an identification device as well as an access device, so don\u2019t lose it and make sure it\u2019s always visible and on top of the outmost layer of your clothes.\u201d</p>\n<p>One by one, Kate calls out all the names, skipping Peter\u2019s, and hands them the sleek white badges that have the name of its owner and a number 1 printed on it.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t Parker get one?\u201d Flash asks, when Kate gives the empty box to the receptionist.</p>\n<p>\u201cPeter Parker already has a badge,\u201d Kate replies, and Peter takes his badge out of his pocket, hanging the lanyard around his neck. His just reads <em> Parker, P. </em> and has no number. Flash looks taken aback. \u201cMr Stark is very strict in his rule against reprints. Who wants to tell me why?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWasting resources?\u201d Abe guesses.</p>\n<p>\u201cSecurity risk?\u201d Ned adds.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re both correct. Now, there are different levels of clearance,\u201d Kate explains, and gestures at the class, \u201cLevel 1 is what you have, and these are basically visitor badges. They don\u2019t grant you access anywhere past the security gates without someone with a higher lever clearance supervising, or when you\u2019re given temporary access to a specific place, in which case it only allows you to go there. Level 1 badges are given to tour groups, but also the press for example. All employees have higher clearance, and what clearance someone has depends on the department they work in, and also the position they\u2019re in. So, for example, R&amp;D inters have access to some R&amp;D floors, but not all of them. The top scientists of departments and the department heads, who are also part of the Board of Directors, are the ones who have access to the whole department. Service and maintenance workers have designated floors that they have access to.</p>\n<p>\u201cMost of this building is occupied by R&amp;D department, IT department, and laboratories. There are also other departments, such as Finance and Accounting, Sales and Marketing, or Human Resource Management, but they don\u2019t take up that much space here, and they also have quarters in other locations. And the Production department isn\u2019t located in this building at all. You may notice a number 1 on your badge. That\u2019s only for visitor badges, and indicates the lowest clearance. Employee badges generally have the initials of their department, as you can see here.\u201d</p>\n<p>Kate holds up her badge, which showcases <em> R&amp;D </em> under her name. A few students look at their own number 1. Peter shifts his weight from one foot to another and hides his initial-less badge behind crossed arms. Technically, Peter doesn\u2019t even need the badge, FRIDAY recognizes him without it, and Tony has given him full clearance, and that\u2019s why he can conceal his badge right now without fear of the AI sending out an alert.</p>\n<p>\u201cAny questions?\u201d Kate asks.</p>\n<p>\u201cDo interns and scientists have same-looking badges? Just, there\u2019s no rank indication on yours,\u201d Cindy asks, and Kate smiles at her.</p>\n<p>\u201cNice one. Yes, aside from the level 1 passes, for safety reasons there is no outward indication on the badge about what the bearer\u2019s access extent is in their department, all that info in encrypted within the card. My badge and my superior\u2019s badge look the same.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat about security?\u201d Charlie supplies, eyeing the black clad personnel at the security gates. \u201cDo they have clearance everywhere?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, not exactly. There is security personnel on every floor, and they have access to that floor, plus two floors above and below them, so if there\u2019s a situation that requires more security than is on the floor, extra help can come from the near floors, that is the standard setting. But there are a lot of different protocols in place for the security department that activate when a certain kind of situation arises. In case of emergency, a protocol for that type of emergency activates and they can have access to wherever they need to go. There\u2019s only a handful of people who have access to the entire Tower including the top floors, and their badges just have their name. Tony Stark, Pepper Potts, and Happy Hogan are some of these people, to name a few. The Avengers used to have special passes that let them go only to the top five floors, which are private and which is where Mr Stark\u2019s penthouse and lab are located, along with the Avengers\u2019 previous living quarters, but they have moved to a new facility upstate, so that\u2019s not the case anymore. Anyways, that\u2019s enough introduction for now! Let\u2019s get you through security and have you meet our AI.\u201d</p>\n<p>The group starts moving towards the security gates, and Kate goes first, swiping her badge in front of the screen. The students wince when a voice speaks seemingly out of nowhere, but Peter recognizes FRIDAY.</p>\n<p>\n<em> \u201cKate Layberg. Intern. Research and Development. Clearance level: medium. Granted temporary access for areas of facility tour program.\u201d </em>\n</p>\n<p>Hearing the AI stirs up excitement, and one after another, the class starts making their way through the security.</p>\n<p>\n<em> \u201cEugene Thompson. Visitor. Clearance level: minimal.\u201d </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em> \u201cAbraham Brown. Visitor. Clearance level: minimal.\u201d </em>\n</p>\n<p>Peter hangs back, until he and Ms Warren are the only ones left on the other side, and with a sigh, he swipes his badge.</p>\n<p>\u201cPeter Parker. Clearance level: all access. Hello again, Peter! Enjoy your tour,\u201d FRIDAY\u2019s says, not mentioning Peter\u2019s person status, and her voice has more emotion when she\u2019s addressing Peter.</p>\n<p>\u201cThanks, FRI,\u201d Peter mumbles, and he thinks he should have thought to tell Tony to make FRIDAY pretend he\u2019s a normal intern and not technically a family member. FRIDAY\u2019s voice hadn\u2019t been loud enough to reach the whole class, but about a half of them are staring at him and he can feel his ears start to burn.</p>\n<p>\u201cHow does Parker have all access?\u201d Flash gapes, looking between Peter, Kate, and the security gate. \u201cDid you hack it?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSI has never been hacked, the security here is near impenetrable, and FRIDAY is a whole different layer of security on her own that only Mr Stark has access too,\u201d Kate says, frowning at Flash, \u201cI assure you, if Mr Parker has all access, it was granted to him. Let\u2019s keep moving!\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter sighs, and forces himself to ignore the eyes he can feel burning into him.</p>\n<p>The first half of the trip he surprisingly manages to avoid most confrontations. He always keeps Ned and MJ by his side, and sticks close to Ms Warren, because Flash isn\u2019t stupid enough to try getting at Peter when she can hear. And like that, he actually enjoys the tour. Kate\u2019s talk is interesting even if he knows some of the stuff already, and he actually hasn\u2019t been to the IT department before, so it is cool.</p>\n<p>It is when it\u2019s <em> lunch break, let\u2019s make it 45 minutes, </em>when Peter sits down to eat, when Flash settles down next to him, swatting at Peter\u2019s hand with a fork. It\u2019s not enough to hurt - Peter doesn\u2019t think Flash Thompson has ever physically hurt him (small mercies) - but it\u2019s annoying.</p>\n<p>Peter isn\u2019t the only one annoyed - Flash seems positively irritated.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo, what\u2019s up with your badge, Penis? Why do you have all access?\u201d he asks, scrunching up his nose and grabbing at Peter\u2019s badge, turning it around in his hand. Peter hunches his shoulders and tugs it back by his lanyard. Flash already saw it though.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo department? So you\u2019re not an intern, I knew it! I bet you\u2019re just a glorified janitor or something, hah,\u201d he snorts, looking triumphant.</p>\n<p>\u201cMy badge doesn\u2019t have a department because I\u2019m not an intern of one specific department,\u201d Peter says, pushing his meatballs around on his plate.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe AI didn\u2019t name you as an intern at the gate,\u201d Flash states, and it\u2019s obvious he thinks he\u2019s got Peter now.</p>\n<p>\u201cShe didn\u2019t name me as a janitor either,\u201d Peter points out, feeling too exasperated to remind him that service workers have designated floors.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo why <em> do </em> you have all access, <em> Penis </em>?\u201d Flash demands, getting uncomfortably into Peter\u2019s personal space and Peter\u2019s skin crawls. His spidey-sense is buzzing, not strong enough to be bothersome but enough to distract him.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m- I\u2019m Mr Stark\u2019s personal intern, I need to get to wherever he goes,\u201d he mumbles, and it sounds more like a question than a statement, and Flash leans away, snickering.</p>\n<p>\u201cPlease, you\u2019ve never even seen Mr Stark face to face,\u201d he says, and his eyes fall to Peter\u2019s jacket.</p>\n<p>\u201c\u201cStark\u201d? What\u2019s that supposed to be, Tony Stark\u2019s jogging dress? Where\u2019d you get that from, eBay? That\u2019s pathetic even for you, I hope he sees this and laughs,\u201d he sneers, looking pitiful, and takes his tray to another table. Ned rubs Peter\u2019s back, frowning in Flash\u2019s general direction.</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t know why you won\u2019t just prove him wrong. You\u2019d only need to say one word and Mr Stark would come down here and set him straight, I <em> know </em> he would.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI know. I think he\u2019ll probably show up at one point anyways, if last night is anything to go by, and I have no idea what to expect of that. But I don\u2019t need to prove anything to <em> Flash </em>,\u201d Peter sighs, finishing up his meatballs. \u201cBesides, it\u2019s better he believes it\u2019s a fake. Otherwise I\u2019d have to explain why I have Tony Stark\u2019s literal jacket and I don\u2019t think I could come up with a good explanation.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t just talking about the jacket.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It is on one of the R&amp;D intern floors that they are visiting where Peter\u2019s internship gets proved to be very much true. One of the interns who Peter has worked with several times, Samuel O\u2019Neill, is answering questions, and Peter can feel his apprehension levels rise when Flash raises his hand.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo how many other interns have you met? Do you, like, meet all of them at one point or is it the same bunch around you all the time?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s way too many to meet all of them, but I\u2019d like to think I\u2019m familiar with most of the R&amp;D interns around this floor and within the two floors above us and four floors below us, and can at least recognize the faces of about half the R&amp;D interns in general, since I oversee a lot of the newbies,\u201d Samuel says with a non-committal shrug.</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you know Peter Parker?\u201d Flash asks, with a surprisingly neutral expression, and Samuel seems surprised, quickly scanning the crowd and smiling widely when he sees Peter.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, I know Peter,\u201d he says, and Flash looks taken aback. Samuel turns to Peter for a moment. \u201cI didn\u2019t know this was your class, Peter. Hi!\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter waves at him, smiling.</p>\n<p>\u201cWait, so he\u2019s actually an intern?\u201d Flash clarifies, and he\u2019s not the only one who looks surprised by the fact. Ned is snickering into his sleeve.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, and an amazing one at that, the kid is, like, crazy smart,\u201d Sam replies, making a gesture with his hands that is supposed to stress just <em> how </em> smart he thinks Peter is, and then snorts. \u201cOf course, it\u2019d be great if he came down here more often, we only get to have him when we\u2019re lucky. Stark loves to hog Peter all for himself. For such a generous guy he\u2019s awfully stingy when it comes to sharing this kid. Though, I would be, too.\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter\u2019s ears burn, and Flash resembles a fish out of water.</p>\n<p>Kate guides the class out of the R&amp;D lab and into the hallway.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd now,\u201d Kate says, \u201cwe\u2019re going to have a look at some laboratories higher up, where-\u201d</p>\n<p>She never gets to finish her sentence.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat sounds cool and also very by the plan,\u201d a voice Peter knows all too well says, and everybody whips around to witness the one and only Tony Stark leisurely lean against a wall, one hand in his trouser pocket, the other hanging his sunglasses on the collar of his shirt. He doesn\u2019t look formal, in fact, he\u2019s pretty casual. But even despite the grey slacks and white t-shirt, there is a fresh kind of sharpness about him, an ambience that tells you: yes, this truly <em> is </em>Anthony Edward Stark.</p>\n<p>Tony pushes himself off the wall and walks towards the group in an unhurried pace.</p>\n<p>\u201cBut what\u2019s a field trip without some improvisation, am I right? Let\u2019s spice things up a little, see some really cool stuff, what do you say, kids?\u201d</p>\n<p>The stunned silence he\u2019d created upon his sudden arrival dissipates immediately, and the hallway vibrates with excited cheers of 32 students, Peter sinking to the background. Tony sports an amused smirk that turns into a full-on grin when he locks eyes with Peter.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, and hey, Pete, if you think you\u2019re doing a good job hiding back there then I\u2019ve got some bad news for you,\u201d he says, making it sound like an off-hand comment, but immediately the noise dials down and every pair of eyes is now set on Peter.</p>\n<p>Peter\u2019s starting to reach his daily limit of being stared at by literally every person in his class at once.</p>\n<p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t, uh, I wasn\u2019t hiding,\u201d he responds, begrudgingly moving towards Tony when the class parts like the Red Sea. That exasperation mostly disappears as soon as he reaches Tony, though. It\u2019s like just standing in the near vicinity of Tony has a relaxing effect on him. He almost wants to be annoyed at that.</p>\n<p>Tony\u2019s eyes twinkle and there\u2019s a new smile tugging at the corners of his lips as he looks at Peter, reaching out his hand to pull at the strap of the jacket Peter\u2019s wearing, before smoothing out the front.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo <em> that\u2019s </em>where this went,\u201d Tony says, like he\u2019s surprised he didn\u2019t come to that sooner, but he looks fond. \u201cAnd here I was worried I\u2019m finally reaching the dreaded age where people misplace their stuff and then forget all about it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, right, sorry, I couldn\u2019t find my own hoodie,\u201d Peter says, shoving his hands deep into the jacket pockets. Tony shrugs, obviously not bothered by Peter\u2019s little robbery one bit.</p>\n<p>\u201cI could, it\u2019s in my lab. Which,\u201d he smoothly turns towards the class who\u2019d looked the exchange as if they were witnessing two deities appear out of thin air, and certain individuals looked ready to implode, \u201cis where we\u2019re going. Note, though, do not touch anything. Rule of thumb up there: if it looks dangerous, it probably is, and if it doesn\u2019t look dangerous, there\u2019s a good chance it still is. Or it may just make a big mess. I don\u2019t want to be responsible for any lost fingers or heads, creates lots of paperwork. That being said, come forth, everyone, let\u2019s go see where the magic happens!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The lab is, of course, amazing. Once someone had the courage to ask the first question about something, they kept coming, and Tony keeps answering them, demonstrating different prototypes and explaining how they work.</p>\n<p>\u201cPeter helps me out a lot,\u201d he says as an addition to something that Peter wasn\u2019t paying attention to.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s been improving Romanov\u2019s widow bites and tinkers with Spider-Man\u2019s stuff quite often. In fact, kid, why don\u2019t you show them something you\u2019ve worked on recently?\u201d</p>\n<p>Peter\u2019s head snaps up.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, uh, alright,\u201d he stammers, making his way to one of the metal cabinets and looking to Tony one more time for confirmation.</p>\n<p>He takes out one of the web-shooters that he still hasn\u2019t gotten fixed, and goes to stand next to Tony, holding it out for his classmates to see.</p>\n<p>\u201cUh, well, one of the works in progress right now are Spider-Man\u2019s web-shooters,\u201d he starts, turning the web-shooter in his palm to give his hands something to do.</p>\n<p>\u201cObviously, he uses them a lot and kind of depends on them, so it\u2019s important that everything works as optimally as possible and doesn\u2019t act up or break easily. I\u2019ve reassembled this one after adding a few minor upgrades - adding more web fluid containers and so on - but the release mechanism is still, like, way too sensitive and doesn\u2019t work the way it\u2019s supposed t-\u201d</p>\n<p>\n<em> Thwip! </em>\n</p>\n<p>Peter flinches in alarm as the web-shooter in his hand goes off at his thoughtless fiddling, as if to prove his point, and then he slaps a hand over his mouth.</p>\n<p>The sticky white webbing is all over Tony\u2019s chest and right arm.</p>\n<p>The room is so silent you could hear a pin drop.</p>\n<p>Peter\u2019s sure everyone in this room is convinced he\u2019s just signed his death sentence, and probably, a long time ago, he would have thought the same.</p>\n<p>Peter tries so hard to not laugh. Tony is giving him <em> a look. </em></p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, you didn\u2019t really have to <em> demonstrate </em>that part, kiddo,\u201d he says, rolling his eyes, and Peter runs a hand through his hair.</p>\n<p>\u201cSorry, Tony! I\u2019ll get the web dissolver.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSee, this is one of those messes I was talking about,\u201d Tony says to the class while Peter goes to rummage through a glass cabinet to get the liquid. \u201cWhile he\u2019s getting me out of this stuff, does anyone have any more questions?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIs Parker in trouble now? Is he gonna get fired or something?\u201d Flash asks, shooting a glance in Peter\u2019s direction.</p>\n<p>Tony gives him a weird look.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, of course not. This was an accident, and an easily fixable one at that. Accidents happen. He\u2019ll be more careful next time. Or the time after that.\u201d</p>\n<p>He then shoots a sideways glance to Peter who\u2019d been steadily freeing Tony of his sticky situation.</p>\n<p>\u201cStop laughing.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not laughing!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, see, I know you, Parker. You\u2019re laughing in your head. I can <em> hear </em>it. Stop!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay, dad.\u201d</p>\n<p>The reply is so automatic either of them barely think about it, but the rest of the room is filled with jaws dropped to the floor.</p>\n<p>\u201cAny more questions?\u201d Tony asks, stretching out his hand as Peter finally gets all of the webbing off.</p>\n<p>Flash has one. Of course he does.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy is Parker your personal intern?\u201d he asks, and his face looks like he\u2019s just swallowed a very bitter fruit.</p>\n<p>\u201cIf you would elaborate?\u201d Tony says, tilting his head.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat makes <em> him </em>so special? He\u2019s not even that smart, there are way smarter people in our school,\u201d Flash supplies, casting Peter an angry look. Peter pulls the jacket tighter around him. \u201cAnd you\u2019re a Stark, you wouldn\u2019t be hiring high school kids.\u201d</p>\n<p>Tony\u2019s eyes narrow.</p>\n<p>\u201cFirst of all, I spent 21 years of my life listening to what a Stark is, does, or doesn\u2019t do, and I am frankly <em> done </em> with that, especially from someone who\u2019s not old enough to drive without their mother on the passenger seat. Second of all, I don\u2019t think you and I are speaking of the same kid,\u201d he says, and his voice is so, so cold. Tony puts an arm around Peter\u2019s shoulder and the distaste he feels towards that Thompson kid is amplified by the way Peter relaxes into him.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis Peter Parker is one of the smartest goddamn <em> people </em> I have ever met, and I\u2019ve met me. He\u2019s 16 years old and he\u2019s able to keep up with nearly anything I do and offer valuable insight, and I have no doubt he\u2019s going to be better than me one day. He\u2019s <em> already </em> better than me, because he\u2019s kind, and forgiving, and compassionate, and so damn selfless to the point I <em> wish </em> he thought about himself as much as he thinks about the others. What\u2019s so special about Peter Parker? <em> What isn\u2019t? </em> If this kid doesn\u2019t come to work for SI once he\u2019s of legal age, I\u2019m going to <em> buy </em>whatever company he ends up working for.\u201d</p>\n<p>There\u2019s another stunned silence that descends upon the room.</p>\n<p>Peter\u2019s face is burning, but so is his chest, and there\u2019s a lump in his throat, and Tony\u2019s arm around him is grounding and protecting him at the same time and he can smell motor oil and he doesn\u2019t want to be here but at the same time he wants to stay in this spot for as long as he lives.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, uh that\u2019s all the time we have for the tour,\u201d Kate timidly speaks up, collecting herself the fastest.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll be keeping this one,\u201d Tony says to Ms Warren, nodding at Peter. \u201cI\u2019ve already spoken with his aunt and everything.\u201d</p>\n<p>Ms Warren takes a look at the messages Tony shows him, confirming that he, indeed, can keep Peter, and soon they\u2019re the only ones left.</p>\n<p>\u201cWas that Mr Stark enough for you?\u201d Tony asks, voice soft as if he knows what Peter\u2019s been thinking. Maybe he does.</p>\n<p>Peter responds by wrapping his arms around Tony as tight as he can without breaking the man\u2019s ribs. There\u2019s a gentle hand combing through his hair.</p>\n<p>\u201cI love you,\u201d he mumbles into Tony\u2019s shoulder.</p>\n<p>\u201cLove you too, kid. Love you too.\u201d</p>"
