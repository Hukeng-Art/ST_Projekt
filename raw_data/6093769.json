  "text": "<p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Harry, I know this is a disappointment,\u201d Shacklebolt said, when old Jeremiah Arkendale was appointed Interim Minister for Magical Enforcement. \u201cBut you\u2019ve only had one year as Chief Auror. It\u2019s not entirely unreasonable for the Wizengamot to want you to have a little more seasoning before you assume the post.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cKingsley, it\u2019s just more of the same nonsense and you <em>know</em> it,\u201d Harry said. \u201cLast year it was the \u2018scandal\u2019 of excessive department spending, because my unit needed to buy more protective gear and containment units to handle the <em>cartloads</em> of Dark artifacts we\u2019ve been digging up. The year before that, it was accusations of favoritism, because I\u2019ve brought on former members of Dumbledore\u2019s Army without making them do tests to show me they can do the spells <em>I taught them</em>. And before that\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>But there wasn\u2019t any help for it. The Wizengamot still had too many stodgy old wizards, the sort who hadn\u2019t approved of Voldemort mostly because he made too much fuss and bother. Whenever the Slytherin faction could talk them round to their side, Shacklebolt couldn\u2019t push a vote through.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd they all keep <em>falling</em> for it,\u201d Harry said furiously, throwing his cloak at the hook and catching Hugo as the three-year-old came sailing straight off the banister at him with a squeal of glee. He carried him into the dining room: dishes were already gliding over from the dumbwaiter and arranging themselves on the table while the crockery hopped out of the cupboard.</p>\n<p>\u201cHarry, you <em>must</em> be fair, it sounds reasonable enough to say one year as Chief Auror doesn\u2019t <em>entirely</em> prepare you for a Ministerial position,\u201d Hermione said, depositing Rose in her high chair.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s <em>mad</em>, though, Hermione!\u201d Ron said, taking Hugo from Harry and wrangling on his bib. \u201cArkendale's a relic. He can barely totter into the office in the mornings, he\u2019s been doing nothing but light paperwork for the last three decades. It\u2019s just an accident he\u2019s never retired.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, then he sounds perfect,\u201d Hermione said, practically. \u201cHe\u2019s a <em>placeholder</em>. He\u2019ll hang about for a few months, and then he\u2019ll retire, and at that point, Harry will have had more seasoning, and there won\u2019t be anyone left the Slytherins can latch on to. And in the meantime, I\u2019m sure he won\u2019t interfere with your work much at all.\u201d</p>\n<p>Arkendale clung to office for fourteen months, during which he forgot meetings, lost half of Harry\u2019s warrant applications and equipment requests, delayed the other half, never came in until ten, went right back out for three-hour lunches\u2014occasionally with suspects in active investigations\u2014and called him Harold in a quavery avuncular tone whenever Harry did manage to corner him in the office.</p>\n<p>It was maddening: it had already taken Harry eight long years of clawing his way up the ranks of the Auror Division to finally get into position to do anything systematic. Even as Chief Auror it felt like all he could do was put sticking plasters over gaping wounds, what with half the old pureblood families hiding Dark artifacts under the bed and a solid voting bloc of them in the Wizengamot fighting tooth and nail to hold on to all their old privileges. They weren\u2019t all Slytherins, but almost: the kind of people who\u2019d run away from Hogwarts when Voldemort was at the door, even if they hadn\u2019t been on the other side <em>with</em> him, and Millicent Bulstrode of all people had inherited her dad\u2019s old seat and was leading the obstructionist brigade.</p>\n<p>Harry nearly started a real fight half a dozen times, but Hermione talked him down, over and over. \u201cYou\u2019re never going to be appointed if you give Arkendale an excuse to dismiss you!\u201d she\u2019d said. \u201cYou just need to be patient, he can\u2019t hold out forever,\u201d although as the months rolled on it began to feel as though possibly he <em>could</em>, until one day Harry came into the office and found a gleeful if faintly embarrassed Hannah Abbott waiting for him, saying, \u201cHe got taken to St. Mungo\u2019s last night with chest pains!\u201d and three days later, Shacklebolt finally had Arkendale\u2019s letter of resignation.</p>\n<p>\u201cNow, <em>finally</em>,\u201d Harry said, feeling almost savage about it, and a week later he walked into the confirmation hearings and fixed his eyes hard on Bulstrode and her crew while he answered all the questions they threw at him, and didn\u2019t answer with so much as a blink any of the vicious insinuations\u2014such an <em>odd</em> living arrangement, his sharing a roof with his married best friends, was there anything <em>unstable</em> about his home life, like Grimmauld Place didn\u2019t have seven bedrooms and three bathrooms and would\u2019ve been ghastly to rattle around in alone.</p>\n<p>Ginny lost her own temper after that session and offered furiously to marry him after all, just to shut them up. \u201cNo,\u201d he said. \u201cYou were right the first time round, Ginny, and I\u2019m not giving them a single thing they want out of me, not <em>one</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>The next day the <em>Daily Prophet</em> ran an article about the hearings with a photograph of him on the front page, staring out hard-faced and angry, but more importantly a chart of the Wizengamot with more than half the seats lit up in red, only a few along the edge flickering, that said <em>Chief Auror Potter is presently expected to be confirmed as Minister by a secure margin</em>.</p>\n<p>Bulstrode\u2019s gang dug up half a dozen more stupid and petty excuses to delay the confirmation vote\u2014one of the key members of the Magical Enforcement committee was ill for a week with dragon pox, and then mysteriously a Vermicious Stinkbug got into the main chamber of the Wizengamot and the place needed another week for fumigation, and then out of nowhere one of the oldest members stood up and announced he was retiring and moving to France, and gave a rambling and incoherent farewell speech that lasted three solid days, since not enough people were willing to shout him down to move business along.</p>\n<p>Finally his voice gave out, and Harry thought that was it at last, but that evening there was a mysteriously unexplained malfunction on the Hogwarts Express\u2014it was just two days before Hogwarts term finished for the year\u2014and Bulstrode managed to get the entire Wizengamot to take a week\u2019s recess so members could go and pick up their children in person.</p>\n<p>But the first day back, Shacklebolt stood up the instant the horn had been blown and called for an immediate vote, and one after another the pebbles rolled down the channels into the counting boxes, white and black accumulating, until finally the last one needed dropped in and the glowing letters flamed across the bottom of Harry\u2019s letter of appointment: <em>Confirmed by the Wizengamot this Seventh Day of June in the Year 2008</em>.</p>\n<p>Harry waited until all the pebbles had been dropped before he stood up, the letter clenched in his fist and fierce satisfaction swelling in his chest. \u201cI thank the Wizengamot for its confidence, and wish to assure you that I will carry out my duties to the <em>utmost</em>,\u201d he said, which was all the speech he could trust himself to give, and Shacklebolt was stepping forward smiling with the Tome of Merlin, to take his oath, when Zacharias Smith stood up from the Archivist\u2019s Seat and called out, \u201cPoint of order!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSeconded, seconded,\u201d a dozen people called from the Slytherin side, and Harry gritted his teeth as Shacklebolt turned and said, flatly, \u201cYes, Archivist?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMinister, the oath cannot be administered to the candidate,\u201d Smith said in the most pompous way imaginable. \u201cThe requirements for the post have not been met.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cChief Auror Potter has been confirmed by the Wizengamot! There are no other requirements!\u201d Arthur Weasley shouted, from the front rows, and there was a round of shouting on both sides that finally subsided as Smith held up his hand.</p>\n<p>\u201cHonorable wizards and witches of the Wizengamot, I regret to raise any difficulty at this late date, but the Act for the Avoidance of the Disorder Among the French, 1794, is perfectly clear upon this subject, to wit: <em>Be it known that henceforth no wizard shall be appointed to the rank of Minister in these British Isles, save that he be a wizard of good character who hath secured through his seventh year the good opinion of his instructors at the Hogwarts School for Witchcraft and Wizardry</em>, which, I must point out, Chief Auror Potter has never managed to accomplish.\u201d</p>\n<p>#</p>\n<p>It had the quality of one of those awful nightmares where you went running endlessly round your dormitory trying to find the homework that was due in Transfigurations, full of hideous knowledge that you were going to be late, only this was <em>actually happening</em>.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m twenty-eight!\u201d Harry said. \u201cI\u2019ve been an Auror for ten years! You want me to go back to Hogwarts <em>now?</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>I</em> don\u2019t make the rules, Potter!\u201d Zacharias said coldly.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, he just digs them out of moldy old tomes nobody else even knows exist and reminds everybody at the most opportune moment,\u201d Harry said furiously at dinner that night.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, of all the objections they <em>might</em> have raised, Harry, I must say, at least <em>this</em> one has some rational sense to it,\u201d Hermione said.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou can\u2019t be <em>serious</em>, \u2019Mione!\u201d Ron said.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve told both of you over and over, it would be a good idea to go back and take your N.E.W.T.s!\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s not wasted effort at all. It hurts your magic if you\u2019ve missed certain practical foundations.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve managed this long!\u201d Harry said.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, you haven\u2019t! You\u2019re excellent at combat magic, but your Charms come out unbalanced half the time,\u201d Hermione said. \u201cAnd don\u2019t tell me it doesn\u2019t matter! You got hurt in that duel last year because Karkaras was able to evade your Calming Charm\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBecause you tried to <em>use</em> a Calming Charm instead of just blasting the rotten bugger,\u201d Ron muttered.</p>\n<p>Harry took the glass of wine that the table had put in front of him and threw back half of it in one swallow. \u201cIt\u2019s not like I\u2019ve got a choice, anyway.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCan\u2019t the Wizengamot just toss the rule?\u201d Ron asked.</p>\n<p>\u201cThey <em>could</em>, but they <em>won\u2019t</em>,\u201d Harry said. \u201cBulstrode and her lot jumped right on it. Smith had barely sat down before they started in\u2014a dozen speeches on not making special exceptions and changing the rules after the fact, and they\u2019ve talked enough of the Wizengamot round.\u201d He shoved a hand through his hair. \u201cAnd here I was angry they\u2019d wasted three <em>weeks</em> of my time.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got to do the whole year?\u201d Ron said.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Harry said grimly. \u201cIf the term was still going, McGonagall would\u2019ve been able to let me just sit the exams and be done, but thanks to the other delays\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>Hermione put her hand on his arm. \u201cIt\u2019s just one year, Harry.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOne <em>more</em> year, after all the rest!\u201d Harry said. \u201cI\u2019m <em>done</em> with this, \u2019Mione. It\u2019s just more time for that lot to smuggle more of their Dark artifacts out of the country. Abbott caught another shipment at Portsmouth yesterday, did I tell you? Four crates full of 40-year-old Influencing Infusions disguised as wine. We\u2019re reasonably sure they were from the Zabinis\u2019 cellars\u2014not that we can get the warrant we\u2019d need to prove it,\u201d he added bitterly. He\u2019d been looking forward to signing that one this afternoon.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe time will go before you know it,\u201d Hermione said. \u201cAnd school can\u2019t help but be easier when you haven\u2019t got Voldemort to worry about. I\u2019m sure you won\u2019t have any trouble with your lessons,\u201d she added in a bright encouraging way, and Harry groaned and let his head fall back in frustration as he realized that to top it all off, he was going to have to <em>study</em>.</p>\n<p>#</p>\n<p>Harry meant to stay angry during the whole term, on principle, but he couldn\u2019t help it: the moment he stepped out onto the Hogwarts platform and saw Hagrid looming over the crowd at the far end, older and greyer but still bellowing, \u201cFirst-years over here! First-years, follow me,\u201d his breath promptly swelled out to the limits of his ribcage. He stood watching the crowd of students flowing into their two separate rivers, and there were tears prickling in his eyes as he walked down the path to the carriages, the thestrals turning to whicker at him as he passed.</p>\n<p>McGonagall met him inside the doors, the riot of other students already filling the Great Hall behind her. \u201cHeadmistress,\u201d Harry said, helplessly grinning.</p>\n<p>\u201cAuror Potter,\u201d she said, formally. \u201cI wish you to know that although you have been forced to return as a student,\u201d she sounded faintly disapproving, \u201cthe staff have voted to invite you to join us at the high table for meals, and to make you welcome in the staffroom.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThanks, Headmistress,\u201d Harry said. \u201cIt\u2019s\u2014good to be back.\u201d</p>\n<p>McGonagall let a tiny smile of her own break through. \u201cThe staff are gathering in the cloakroom behind the Great Hall,\u201d she said. \u201cDo leave your things. After dinner, Deputy Headmistress Sprout will take you up: we\u2019ve put you in the guest rooms in the Charms Corridor.\u201d</p>\n<p>She swished away to go speak to the first-years. Harry was still smiling as he levitated his trunk down the side corridor and went into the cloakroom. It was full of professors he mostly didn\u2019t recognize, talking animatedly about their holidays and hanging up cloaks and broomsticks, but a few weren\u2019t strangers. \u201cHello, Harry,\u201d Luna said, coming to kiss his cheek: she was teaching Divination. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to see you again. Although I\u2019m sure you wish you didn\u2019t have to be here.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right,\u201d he said, and he couldn\u2019t help but feel it <em>was</em>, after all.</p>\n<p>\u201cHarry!\u201d Professor Sprout came bustling up and took him by the shoulders, smiling, and kissed him on the cheek. \u201cHow lovely to see you. You\u2019ve grown so\u2014grown-up,\u201d she said hastily, because nobody could say he\u2019d got tall, Harry knew ruefully. \u201cLet me introduce you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Old Marius Andorel was teaching Defense Against The Dark Arts; he\u2019d been an instructor with the Auror Division for years and had retired only just after the war. They\u2019d met a few times. \u201cLooking forward to having you in the class, Potter,\u201d he said with a wheeze. \u201cAlthough fair warning, I may call upon you to give the lectures as often as not, ha ha!\u201d</p>\n<p>The Charms professor was Lydia Gracewell, who Harry vaguely remembered had been a seventh-year Hufflepuff, the year he\u2019d come to Hogwarts. \u201cHermione says I\u2019m to confess to you at once that my Charms are unbalanced, and save myself the mortification of having you find out in class,\u201d Harry said.</p>\n<p>\u201cAre they really?\u201d Gracewell said, laughing. \u201cWell, we\u2019ll sort you out, never fear. I\u2019d be mortified if I couldn\u2019t send out the next Minister for Magical Enforcement with anything less than an Outstanding.\u201d</p>\n<p>It was like\u2014it was like getting to go back home, and instead of finding it shrunken and too-narrow, he\u2019d found it larger than it had been, even warmer and more beautiful. He looked round the room smiling, able to feel again all the uncomplicated happiness he\u2019d felt as a first-year, stumbling through wonders.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, well, we\u2019re all assembled, I see,\u201d a drawling voice said, shockingly familiar, as though the worse bits of first year had decided to jump out and play, too. Harry whirled towards the door: Draco Malfoy was just inside, drawing off leather driving gloves and unslinging a long dark-silver cloak that wrapped the gloves up into a pocket and sailed itself onto the hooks.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat are <em>you</em> doing here?\u201d Harry said, staring.</p>\n<p>Sprout cleared her throat. \u201cProfessor Malfoy is our new Potions instructor.\u201d \u00a0</p>\n<p>Harry stood in appalled silence as the door to the Great Hall opened behind them. \u201cTo your seats, please,\u201d McGonagall said, and the staff all began to funnel out.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo you\u2019ve had to come back, have you, Potter?\u201d Malfoy said blandly, bringing up the rear. \u201cWe must hope you\u2019ll be able to do satisfactory work without Granger to copy from. Millicent sends her best, by the way,\u201d he added, sweeping past with a smirk. \u201cShe does hope you\u2019ll enjoy your\u2014<em>extended</em> stay.\u201d</p>\n<p>#</p>\n<p>It became perfectly clear what Harry was up against the minute he set foot in the seventh-year Potions classroom. He\u2019d never thought any lesson could possibly make him remember Snape\u2019s teaching with charity, but at least Snape had never actively spelled away his ingredients while Harry was looking the other way, or hexed his knife, or tipped over his cauldron. \u201cBetter luck next class, Potter,\u201d Draco said as the other students filed out. He was perched on the workbench poking through the smoking aftermath of Harry\u2019s potion while Harry scrubbed the counter and mentally reminded himself that hexing a professor would get him expelled.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou can\u2019t keep this up forever, Malfoy,\u201d Harry said through his teeth.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy, whatever do you mean?\u201d Draco said, mockingly. \u201cBad form, trying to blame your failure on the instruction. I ought to take points or something.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry finished and threw the filthy rag into the cleaning bucket. \u201cWhat does Bulstrode even think she\u2019s going to gain from all this?\u201d he demanded. \u201cYou can\u2019t stop me passing my N.E.W.T.s, no matter how annoying you are.\u201d</p>\n<p>Malfoy raised his eyebrows. \u201cWhy, look at that, someone didn\u2019t understand the statute.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Harry said warily.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cReally I should make you go and read it again yourself,\u201d Malfoy said. \u201cBut in the interest of getting to see your face when you realize, I\u2019ll just tell you: it\u2019s nothing to do with the N.E.W.T.s. Those are merely department policy. The <em>statute</em> requires that you leave with the good opinion of your instructors, which, I assure you, includes that of the Potions master.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry stared at him narrowly. \u201cMcGonagall can overrule you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco smiled and leaned over the table and wiped a streak up the inside of Harry\u2019s blackened cauldron, rubbing the stinking residue between thumb and forefinger in front of his face. \u201cNot if you haven\u2019t managed to complete a single classroom assignment successfully she can\u2019t,\u201d he said softly, and blew the stinging dust into Harry\u2019s face.</p>\n<p>He slid down off the workbench and went out humming the Slytherin House song, going out of range at just the right moment to leave it stuck in Harry\u2019s head the rest of the day.</p>\n<p>#</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019ll just have to use <em>Protego</em> to block his sabotage spells,\u201d Hermione said, busily making notes: Harry had come straight back to his rooms and called her and Ron on the Floo. \u201cI\u2019ll spell you an Unjinxable Cauldron, and don\u2019t use the class burners from now on, use a Calorium spell. Don\u2019t worry too much, Harry\u2014it\u2019s just Malfoy. You know he\u2019s only an irritating little snake.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t be insulting to snakes, they\u2019ve got a lot to bear,\u201d Harry said sourly. \u201cBut can\u2019t he just block me no matter what I do in class?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Hermione said. \u201cOr rather, he can put a black mark against you if he likes, which by the terms of the statute might disqualify you, but you can appeal it to the headmaster. I looked it up one year when I was worried Snape was going to mark me down. As long as you can demonstrate classroom competence, McGonagall will have cause not only to dismiss the black mark, but to throw Malfoy out entirely.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand, why\u2019s he even teaching in the first place?\u201d Ron said. \u201cAren\u2019t the Malfoys rolling in it? They got off scot-free after the war.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe only joined the staff this summer,\u201d Harry said grimly. \u201cHe must have come on purpose, just to try to keep me here longer. What I can\u2019t understand is why McGonagall <em>hired</em> him.\u201d</p>\n<p>Hermione grimaced. \u201cI hear they\u2019ve had a hard time finding heads of Slytherin House. A lot of former Slytherins have left the country since the war.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry fell silent. The Slytherin tables were smaller too, he realized. A full pair of their long tables were empty at the end of the hall during meals.</p>\n<p>\u201cGood riddance, if you ask me,\u201d Ron said. \u201cJust soldier through it, Harry. Maybe after you finally get into office, Bulstrode and Malfoy will clear out, too. Wouldn\u2019t that be nice.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHarry,\u201d Hermione said thoughtfully, \u201cit will also strengthen McGonagall\u2019s hand if you can prove that Malfoy is deliberately harassing you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cD\u2019you mean, ask the other students to testify?\u201d Harry said.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, they\u2019re children\u2014I was thinking more of the other professors,\u201d Hermione said. \u201cIf they can attest that Malfoy\u2019s out to get you personally, that supports your case that he\u2019s given you a black mark for reasons aside from your work. Try and provoke him to be rude to you in the halls whenever there\u2019s another professor around.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMalfoy\u2019s not going to need any provocation for <em>that</em>,\u201d Harry said.</p>\n<p>He shut the Floo after talking to them, and got up and went down to the staffroom. It was on the ground floor this week, looking out onto the lake, where the Squid was having a lazy thrashing sort of swim on the surface in the sunset water. Draco was stretched out on the window seat with a book\u2014he looked ridiculous, actually, billowy grey silk shirt and buttoned-down vest and trousers creased like they\u2019d been pressed with industrial plates, a silver watch-chain running to his pocket and an emerald stick-pin, the portrait of some Edwardian aristocrat. Gracewell and Jasper Winchley, the Astronomy professor, were both sitting near by him in armchairs.</p>\n<p>\u201cEvening,\u201d Harry said, and got a cup of tea and joined them.</p>\n<p>\u201cHello, Harry,\u201d Lydia said. \u201cFirst day go all right? It must be odd to have to come back, after so much time.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt was all right,\u201d Harry said. \u201cI\u2019d a mishap in Potions. I can\u2019t imagine how it happened.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNever fear, Potter,\u201d Draco said, wafting a hand languidly in his direction. \u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019ll get back into the hang of it eventually. My door is always open, if you need any remedial help.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry reflected with great sorrow that it probably wouldn\u2019t help his case if the other instructors testified that he\u2019d knocked Malfoy\u2019s block off in the staffroom. \u201cThanks,\u201d he said through his teeth. \u201cI might take you up on that.\u201d</p>\n<p>Malfoy kept on being saccharine-polite the whole night, even after Harry made a point of talking about the corruption in the Ministry and his plans for the overhaul of the prosecutorial code. \u201cRich purebloods have been getting away with murder for centuries,\u201d Harry said. \u201cAnd I mean that literally. There\u2019s hundreds of cases on the books where someone flat-out killed a Muggle in the street, and claimed they were being threatened. For a long time, if you showed up in the prosecutor\u2019s office with three character witnesses from \u2018families of good standing,\u2019 they\u2019d just drop the charges and order the Aurors to clean up after it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u201cI suppose that in none of those cases the wizard in question was <em>actually</em> being threatened?\u201d Malfoy said, without looking up from his book.</p>\n<p>\u201cIf a Muggle\u2019s threatening you, there\u2019s usually better ways to handle it than hexing them to death,\u201d Harry said. \u201cWouldn\u2019t you agree?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, it\u2019s not for me to say, surely,\u201d Draco said airily. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever spoken to a Muggle in my life. I can\u2019t consider myself qualified to judge those who have to encounter them regularly.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHmph. I\u2019m surprised they don\u2019t wander onto your property,\u201d Andorel said, grunting. \u201cHalf the cases in the department, in my day. Tourists running wild, poking into old wizarding ruins with their coomeras and small children, getting themselves into trouble. Big house like yours, see the place for miles, I would\u2019ve thought you\u2019d get National Trust sorts coming through three times a day at the weekends.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIf they do, they certainly haven\u2019t managed to obtrude on my attention,\u201d Draco said. \u201cThe estate has very good wards against vermin, naturally.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure this is going to work,\u201d Harry told Hermione, after a few more lovely evenings in the staffroom full of similar conversations where Malfoy went to especial lengths to be as much like himself as he possibly could. \u201cIt\u2019s just making <em>me</em> want to strangle <em>him</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cJust be patient and spend as much time around him as you can,\u201d Hermione said. \u201cI\u2019m sure Malfoy won\u2019t be able to resist being awful to you in public forever.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, great,\u201d Harry said.</p>\n<p>The next Potions lesson, Harry managed to deflect half a dozen minor jinxes, left his burner off, and kept a prudent hold on his cauldron whenever Malfoy walked past his workbench. \u201cDoing better today, Potter?\u201d Malfoy said brightly. \u201cGlad to see it\u2019s coming back to you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLike flying on a broomstick,\u201d Harry said, never taking his narrowed eyes off him for a moment.</p>\n<p>Draco sailed onward, and Harry went to sprinkle in his shredded comfrey. He didn\u2019t realize until it was leaving his grip that something about the texture was off, and it was too late: he\u2019d just dumped two fingers of shredded guslorph roots into the mix instead. The potion thickened so quickly the cauldron rocked off its base and went rolling along the counter, the potion a solid steaming block inside. Harry had to spring forward and grab it with his bare hand before it hit his neighbor\u2014Jane Gorfinkley, a Slytherin seventh-year\u2014and he dropped it back on the base with a hiss of pain.</p>\n<p>\u201cEverything all right over here? Oh dear, that looks nasty.\u201d Draco popped up instantly. Harry glared at him. Malfoy caught his wrist\u2014managing to scrape painfully right against the worst blister as he did. \u201cWhatever happened? This seems to be turning into a habit with you, Potter. We\u2019d better set you right.\u201d Then he took out his wand and murmured a quick Healing Charm over the palm, wiping all the evidence of injury clean, smiling viciously at Harry the whole time.</p>\n<p>Next to him, Gorfinkley kept her head down studiously, not even looking over, and Harry eyed her station: there were faint greenish stains on her cutting-board, just like ichor of guslorph, and they hadn\u2019t cut up anything else that color today.</p>\n<p>In the next lesson, Harry double-checked every ingredient, threw every protection spell he could manage over his entire station and everything on it, and then at the end, just when he was sure he\u2019d got round Malfoy this time, Gwendolyn Mathers-Goyle put a roasted frog on the counter in the row in front of him, and the thing suddenly leaped up and went sailing directly into his Simmering Slime.</p>\n<p>Harry jerked round to see what had splashed, just in time for the whole thing to erupt into his face. Fortunately he\u2019d put a <em>Protego</em> on himself, so the slime only ran off him harmlessly, but everyone around him had it caught in their hair and robes and there was a lot of screaming and distress for the next five minutes.</p>\n<p>Harry finally managed to help the last student get Scourgified and set right, only to turn round and find Malfoy frowning at him, drawn up stiffly, the picture of stern disappointment. \u201cAll right, Mr. Potter,\u201d he said, \u201cI\u2019m well aware of your feelings towards me\u2014or should I say, towards \u2018rich purebloods\u2019? But I will not have my class constantly disrupted in this manner. These students have a right to earn their N.E.W.T., and I expect you to respect that, if nothing else.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry gawked at him in indignation, speechlessly.</p>\n<p>\u201cUnless, of course,\u201d Malfoy added, dripping with sarcasm, \u201cI\u2019m really to believe that the future Minister for Magical Enforcement is incapable of brewing a basic seventh-year potion without disaster. Class dismissed. We\u2019ll be repeating this exercise on Wednesday.\u201d He swept out of the room, leaving even the Gryffindor students shuffling around uncomfortably and eyeing Harry sidelong as they packed up their things.</p>\n<p>#</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m going to murder him,\u201d Harry said calmly. \u201cI didn\u2019t even murder Voldemort, but I\u2019m going to murder <em>him</em>. No one could blame me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHarry!\u201d Hermione said, out of the fireplace.</p>\n<p>\u201cNow, now, Harry,\u201d Hagrid said, creaking down into his chair with the teapot in his hand. He poured them both cups and pushed one over to Harry\u2019s seat. \u201cHave a cup of tea and calm down jus\u2019 a sec.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s sabotaging my work and passing it off that <em>I\u2019m</em> sabotaging his class!\u201d Harry yelled.</p>\n<p>\u201cIn other words,\u201d Hermione said loudly, over him, \u201cyou\u2019re playing <em>exactly into his hands</em>. Honestly! Just because you\u2019ve gone back to Hogwarts is no excuse for behaving like a child again.\u201d</p>\n<p>Ron stuck his head through the Floo. \u201cI\u2019ll help you hide the body.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Hermione shoved Ron out again behind her. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to stop letting him make you dance to his tune, Harry! If you can just get your work done, he can\u2019t do anything more than annoy you for a year. But if you actually did lose your head and knock him down, Bulstrode could summon him and any witnesses to testify before the Wizengamot that you <em>aren\u2019t</em> a wizard of \u2018good character,\u2019 whatever that vague nonsense means, and then they\u2019d have a chance to use the statute to block you entirely.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry sank back into his chair in frustration, shoving his hands in his hair. \u201c<em>Bastard</em>,\u201d he muttered.</p>\n<p>\u201cListen to me,\u201d Hermione said. \u201cYou should go and find him in the staffroom again. Apologize\u2014<em>shut up and listen</em>\u2014you\u2019re going to <em>apologize</em> for the disruption to the class and assure him, in front of the other professors, that it\u2019s nothing personal and not at all deliberate. You\u2019ve no idea why you\u2019re having so much difficulty, and you wonder if he meant it that he\u2019d give you extra help.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThen what?\u201d Harry demanded. \u201cHe\u2019ll say yes!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThen you\u2019ll <em>go</em> to the extra help,\u201d Hermione said. \u201cThis is all about laying a trail of evidence, Harry. You need to make it impossible for Malfoy to justify a black mark\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIf I have to spend more time with him, he won\u2019t have to justify anything!\u201d Harry said. \u201cHe\u2019ll be strangled, and I\u2019ll be in Azkaban. And I won\u2019t even be able to prove he drove me to it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cY\u2019know, maybe I kin help with that,\u201d Hagrid said thoughtfully. \u201cJus\u2019 a sec, I know I\u2019ve got a few of them round here somewhere.\u201d He pushed himself up again and went rummaging around the cottage.</p>\n<p>\u201cI really don\u2019t understand how you\u2019re both fully grown men and you\u2019re still acting like first-years in a grudge match,\u201d Hermione was saying, with Ron\u2019s voice faintly drifting in, \u201cIt\u2019s <em>Malfoy</em>, Hermione!\u201d from the back, when Hagrid came back with a small box with holes in the lid.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat is that?\u201d Harry said.</p>\n<p>\u201cMarvelous Earwig,\u201d Hagrid said, sitting back down with a grunt, breathing heavily. He\u2019d got older more quickly than Harry had even realized. Hagrid lifted the lid on the box and Harry jerked back a little as the giant two-inch earwig nearly jumped out: Hagrid caught it expertly on a pinky and tipped it back inside, putting the lid back on. \u201cYou take li\u2019l Wiggy here with you to your extra sessions. It\u2019s jus\u2019 you n\u2019 Malfoy, so he won\u2019t think to watch what he says. After he incriminates himsel\u2019, you just bring Wiggy back to me. We give him a nice bit of bacon and he\u2019ll repeat the whole thin\u2019 back, for me and anybody else listenin\u2019.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHagrid, you\u2019re a genius,\u201d Harry said, taking the box.</p>\n<p>Malfoy received Harry\u2019s speech frowningly. \u201cOf course, I\u2019d be delighted,\u201d was all he said, though, since Lydia and Sprout were both in the staffroom at the time. \u201cShall we start tonight?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d Harry said brightly, and followed Draco back to the Potions classroom. \u201cYou know, Malfoy, there\u2019s a limit to how many ways you can sabotage my potions.\u201d</p>\n<p>But Malfoy just eyed him suspiciously and said, \u201cI\u2019m sure I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about, Potter. And if that\u2019s your attitude, I\u2019m afraid you\u2019ll have quite a difficult time over the rest of this term. Now, why don\u2019t we begin with a refresher in ingredient preparation? You can start by squeezing these bubotubers for me.\u201d</p>\n<p>#</p>\n<p>Poor Wiggy kept riding in Harry\u2019s pocket, baconless, for the next two months, during which Malfoy and his little coterie of Slytherin students managed to sabotage more than half of Harry\u2019s potions, and incidentally arranged a few other bits of entertainment for him like slipping Finger-Biting jinxes into his books and painting a stripe of Slickening Glaze on the floor of the corridor just outside his rooms.</p>\n<p>They were all careful as could be about it. The one time Harry managed to catch one of them in the act, with a Finger Grabber left on his own doorknob, it was a seventh-year boy who immediately produced a copy of Harry\u2019s essay on fighting vampires for Defense Against The Dark Arts class, and confessed he\u2019d just wanted to \u201csee what a <em>real</em> Auror would\u2019ve done,\u201d hanging his head earnestly. \u00a0</p>\n<p>Draco swept into the corridor before Harry could call McGonagall in, alerted somehow. \u201cWell, you can\u2019t really blame him for being curious, can you,\u201d he said. \u201cBut of course it\u2019s unacceptable behavior. Fifty points from Slytherin, Alcestis, and detention with me for a month. <em>Finite Incantatem!</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>He whacked the doorknob with his wand, setting the boy\u2019s fingers loose, and Harry was distracted enough by Draco having taken <em>fifty points</em> from Slytherin\u2014really, <em>any</em> points from Slytherin\u2014that by the time he\u2019d stopped gawking, Alcestis had taken to his heels and vanished away round the corner. But at dinner that night, Harry realized the fifty points didn\u2019t matter: Slytherin had already been dead last in the House Cup standings, a hundred points down from Hufflepuff in third. The Slytherin kids clearly weren\u2019t even bothering to try\u2014none of them ever raised their hands in any class Harry had with them; they sat together and whispered among themselves and walked through the halls in a pack. Draco was the only professor any of them ever spoke to willingly.</p>\n<p><em>He</em> clearly had no qualms about recruiting students to help with his campaign of harassment. There were six Slytherin students in the advanced Potions class, and it was hard to keep an eye on all of them during an entire classroom session. Harry wasn\u2019t even sure which one of them slipped the feldspar into his Whistling Remedy, which bubbled over onto the floor as a stinking-sweet glaze and managed to immediately attract a hundred Shrieking Salamanders up from the sewers. Draco stood over Harry and lectured him loudly on proper safety protocols the entire time as Harry grimly herded the Salamanders back into the classroom drain and scrubbed the floor by hand.</p>\n<p>Wiggy got his bacon after that, as Harry played back the lecture for Hermione and Ron and Luna from Hagrid\u2019s cottage. \u201cHarry, no one <em>could</em> blame you,\u201d Ron said, his face almost awed with horror. Even Hermione was biting her lip in dismay.</p>\n<p>\u201cI think it\u2019s cute, actually,\u201d Luna said, sipping her tea. They all stared at her. She blinked back. \u201cHe\u2019s still got such a crush on you after all this time.\u201d</p>\n<p>Nobody said anything for a long moment.</p>\n<p>\u201cUm,\u201d Harry said. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s really obvious, isn\u2019t it, when you look back,\u201d Luna said. \u201cHe never believed any of it. Voldemort, I mean. He just wanted to make you notice him. He was so unhappy when he really had to join the Death Eaters.\u201d</p>\n<p>They all sat in total silence for another ten minutes as years of nonstop tormenting and harassment marched through all their heads, suddenly turned upside down. Ron finally said, blankly, \u201cHe\u2019s <em>mental</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI think he\u2019s not very good at handling it, when he can\u2019t have something he wants,\u201d Luna said.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, he\u2019s going to <em>get</em> what he wants,\u201d Harry said, in dawning fierce intensity. \u201cHe\u2019s going to get it right up the\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>#</p>\n<p>Harry was still doing the sessions of remedial Potions work, which mostly consisted of Draco giving him loads of annoying tasks while he sat at the front of the classroom and stretched out his long legs and put them up. Draco\u2019s constant posing around him suddenly took on a whole new light, actually. Harry had figured it was just habit.</p>\n<p>That night Draco gave him an entire counter full of dirty cauldrons to scrub. Harry waited until Draco was ensconced at the front of the room with his view, and then deliberately peeled his robes off over his head. \u201cWhat <em>are</em> you doing?\u201d Draco said.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019d rather not get them splashed, Malfoy,\u201d Harry said. \u201cYou don\u2019t mind, do you?\u201d He tossed them aside. He\u2019d worn a plain t-shirt underneath, one he\u2019d shrunk a couple of sizes, and black jeans: he\u2019d been told more than once his arms were his best feature, thanks to ten years of combat casting and regular exercise. He washed the cauldrons, not even trying to keep from getting wet himself, and felt a savage kind of glee when Malfoy kept darting looks at him, almost like he couldn\u2019t help himself.</p>\n<p>Harry waited until Draco was pretending to read his book again before he finished the last one, then deliberately went up the classroom floor to him. \u201cAnything else you\u2019d like me to do, <em>Professor</em>?\u201d he said, standing over Draco with his shirt soaked and transparent, drying off his hands. \u201cAnything at all?\u201d He made it sound as insinuating as he possibly could.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, that should be all for tonight, Potter,\u201d Draco said\u2014warily, but he couldn\u2019t help another quick once-over of Harry\u2019s chest.</p>\n<p>\u201cGoing into Hogsmeade this weekend?\u201d Harry said, pressing the advantage.</p>\n<p>\u201cIf I\u2019ve the time,\u201d Draco said, even more warily.</p>\n<p>\u201cPerhaps I\u2019ll see you at Three Broomsticks,\u201d Harry said, and deliberately looked Draco over, a long lingering sweep up and down his body. \u201cIf you\u2019re there.\u201d</p>\n<p>He turned and walked out, whisking his robes up into his arm.</p>\n<p>#</p>\n<p>\u201cI really don\u2019t understand, what exactly is the idea here?\u201d Hermione said. \u201cYou want to drive Draco Malfoy mad with lust and you think that\u2019s going to make him stop harassing you? Apparently it hasn\u2019t before now!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, but if he harasses me <em>properly</em>, on record, I\u2019m fairly sure I can get McGonagall to kick him out,\u201d Harry said. \u201cI <em>am</em> a student, after all.\u201d</p>\n<p>He was dressing to go into Hogsmeade, with care: nothing too elaborate, because he couldn\u2019t possibly compete with Draco himself on those grounds, but he put on a green shirt that matched his eyes, and his best robes over it. \u201cHow\u2019s this?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cVery dashing,\u201d Hermione said, folding her arms disapprovingly. \u201cYou look exactly like you\u2019re going out on a date. I\u2019m starting to think Draco\u2019s not the only one with a lingering schoolboy crush.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s not funny!\u201d Harry said, while Ron\u2019s gagging noises were audible even on the other side of the Floo.</p>\n<p>Hogsmeade was full of students, and Three Broomsticks noisy and crowded, but Draco <em>had</em> come, sitting at a back table with a few of the other professors, drinking red wine in a cut-crystal glass. You couldn\u2019t say he\u2019d dressed up, because he was always dressed up, but he was wearing a particularly sharp set of robes, black and silver buttoned all the way up to his collar, sleeves tied on over a pouf of silver-grey shirt coming out at the shoulder, with silver buttons running along the arms to his wrists. He had his wrist stretched out resting on the top of the empty chair next to him, and Harry deliberately went over and took it, sliding into the curve of his arm.</p>\n<p>\u201cHullo, everyone,\u201d he said. \u201cButterbeer for me, thanks.\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco stiffened, but he didn\u2019t move his arm, either. Harry made a point of leaning back in the seat and keeping his eyes on Draco while they all chatted together, and was rewarded with Madame Hooch and Lydia both eyeing them and trading glances. The room thinned out as the day wore on and the students left, until it was just a handful of them remaining, and finally Draco stood up and swung his cloak back on. \u201cI\u2019m for the castle.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll go with you,\u201d Harry said, getting up. He strolled back through the Forest with his hands in his pockets, pleasantly conscious of Draco holding himself rigid and cautious at his side. \u201cNice night,\u201d he said blandly.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat <em>are</em> you doing?\u201d Draco said. The words sounded like they\u2019d had to fight their way out past his teeth.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat does it seem like I\u2019m doing?\u201d Harry said.</p>\n<p>Draco maintained a stiff silence back to the castle. Harry walked him all the way back to his rooms in the main corridor down to the dungeons, Draco shooting sidelong looks at him every step. \u201cRelax, Draco,\u201d Harry said. \u201cI\u2019m not going to bite or anything.\u201d He leaned against the door frame as Draco unlocked his room. \u201cGoing to ask me in?\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco paused, his hand on the knob. \u201cYou can\u2019t be serious about this,\u201d he grated out, sounding like he was on the edge of snapping.</p>\n<p>\u201cI can\u2019t, can\u2019t I?\u201d Harry said.</p>\n<p>Draco stood there another moment, rigid, then he swept the door open and held it for Harry. \u201cAfter you, then,\u201d and Harry hadn\u2019t actually expected him to cave that quickly, but Wiggy was in his pocket and he wasn\u2019t going to pass up the chance. He went inside. Draco\u2019s room was untidy in a studied way: the only things left out were all elaborate and decorative. Leatherbound books and cufflinks scattered over the desk with racks of colored glass vials, and a silk scarf tossed over the arm of the long green-velvet sofa.</p>\n<p>The door closed behind him. Harry turned round to say <em>I never guessed you wanted it that badly, Malfoy,</em> but he didn\u2019t have a chance, because Draco took hold of his head, hand sliding round the back to grip his neck, fingers still cool from the night air, and kissed him almost savagely.</p>\n<p>Harry flailed a moment, no idea what to do or where to put his hands\u2014he grabbed for Malfoy\u2019s shoulders, taking a step back at the same time, but Malfoy came <em>with</em> him, pressing him back into the room, still <em>kissing him</em>, and Harry didn\u2019t have an enormous range of experience with kisses but this one was going on a long time, and he was about to push Malfoy off, but then Malfoy shoved <em>him</em>, instead. Harry staggered back, gasping.</p>\n<p>\u201cIf I\u2019d known you\u2019d give it up for a <em>mark</em>, Potter, I\u2019d have arranged this sooner than now,\u201d Draco said, jerking his robes open at the throat.</p>\n<p>Harry gawked at him\u2014<em>what?</em>\u2014and then Draco shoved him down onto the couch.</p>\n<p>Harry had no idea which to say of <em>wait a second that\u2019s not</em> and <em>I didn\u2019t mean I actually wanted </em>and <em>I only wanted to get you on record saying </em>which all sounded wrong and anyway the main point was he wasn\u2019t actually going to have sex with Draco, who had just slung off his robes and\u2014and\u2014gone to his <em>knees</em>, shoving Harry\u2019s legs apart, and Harry stared down at him in absolute\u2014horror, it was definitely\u2014</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m going to <em>destroy</em> you,\u201d Draco said, and opened Harry\u2019s trousers.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d Harry said, strangled. A moment later he let his head fall back, so at least he didn\u2019t have to watch Draco\u2014 \u201cOh. Oh, <em>God</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco drew off to breathe. \u201cTurning to prayer already?\u201d he purred. \u201cSave something for when we get to the bed.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry craned his head up, feeling wild-eyed, and stared at the bed\u2014the enormous, lavishly draped bed, all gold tassels and velvet hangings and pillows, the kind of bed you could get lost in, for hours maybe, while Draco Malfoy\u2014</p>\n<p>\u2014went back down on you, and Harry shut his eyes and tried to convince himself he wasn\u2019t here, really, this was just a very disturbing dream someone else was having, and then Draco drew off <em>again</em>, the filthy rotter, and said, \u201cDon\u2019t just <em>sit</em> there, Potter, I don\u2019t mind hair-pulling,\u201d oh the <em>bastard</em>, and Harry dug his hands into the silver-blond hair and fisted two handfuls of it and let his hips jerk under Draco\u2019s grip towards his mouth.</p>\n<p>Draco made a <em>pleased</em> noise around him, and Harry gasped helplessly, and yeah, there went his last hope of not having sex with Draco Malfoy tonight, even on a technicality. Draco stood up over him, wiping his mouth\u2014oh God\u2014his flushed, red mouth, breathing hard, his eyes heavy-lidded. \u201cDon\u2019t imagine I\u2019m finished with you,\u201d he said, and whipped his wand in a line down Harry\u2019s front, buttons flying open and the shirt folding itself right off him.</p>\n<p>Harry stared down at his own bare chest a little blankly, and then Draco reached up and caught him by the belt and hauled him up standing into his arms\u2014his silk shirt sliding deliciously against Harry\u2019s chest, Draco\u2019s hand gripping at the base of his skull, Draco\u2019s mouth hot and demanding on his, and oddly Harry seemed to have gone and buried his own hands back into Draco\u2019s hair again.</p>\n<p>Harry\u2019s belt was undoing itself and his trousers were sliding down his legs and his shoes were unlacing themselves, and Draco was maneuvering him over to the bed, shoving him backwards onto it. Draco stripped the rest of the way, lean and pale, and then he climbed inside, after Harry, and the drapes were falling shut all around them, the red glow of candlelight dimming, and Harry swallowed hard and realized it was now or never, he had to stop and get out this instant or Draco was going to\u2014</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, Potter?\u201d Draco said softly. \u201cLast chance. Backing out now?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGet on with it already, Malfoy,\u201d Harry whispered, shaking, and lay back in the bed, already panting even before Draco\u2019s hands slid onto his thighs.</p>\n<p>It was nearly four in the morning when Harry finally crept back to his own quarters, having to make a desperate dash of it to avoid Mrs. Norris in the North Tower. \u201cJust like old times, really,\u201d he said out loud to himself, in the safety of his room. \u201cSneaking around the castle, getting into trouble with my Potions professor,\u201d and he had to sit down with a fit of helpless giggling that was probably a bad sign of something or other.</p>\n<p>He finally managed to calm himself down again. He reached into his pocket and dug out the earwig box. He lifted off the lid. \u201cSorry, Wiggy,\u201d he said apologetically, and tipped the earwig down onto the ground and stepped on it.</p>\n<p>#</p>\n<p>Morning came much too quickly, along with a cotton mouth and aches and pains in really inconvenient places. Harry looked himself over in the mirror anxiously and ran a few quick Healing Charms on the couple of love bites on his chin and neck. \u201cAny more of those in the back?\u201d he asked the mirror, turning round.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, dear, you\u2019re all betters,\u201d the mirror said. \u201cMy, someone had a nice time last night, didn\u2019t they.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Harry said morosely. \u201cI really did.\u201d</p>\n<p>It wasn\u2019t that he\u2019d been in <em>denial</em> or anything, he\u2019d got to grips with being gay within a year of Hogwarts, and he\u2019d even gone on the occasional date since then, but who had time, and anyway he didn\u2019t really want to go to bed with people he didn\u2019t already know. And love, he would\u2019ve said, but last night threw <em>that</em> idea out the window. Apparently he was perfectly happy shagging the unredeemed arsehole who was conspiring to block his appointment to the Ministry. Of course, on the bright side, the unredeemed arsehole was perfectly willing to stop blocking his appointment in exchange for being shagged, so that looked like it was going to all work out nicely for him.</p>\n<p>Harry thumped his head against the wall once gently and went to breakfast. Draco was already there, plate piled high\u2014to be fair, he\u2019d done quite a lot of physical labor the previous night\u2014and Harry had come late enough that there was only the one seat left open, next to him. Harry gingerly took the chair and poured a cup of tea, and then dared to slant a look Draco\u2019s way, only to catch him sneaking a look back, and Harry looked at his mouth and remembered\u2014and they both jerked their eyes right back to their plates and started eating again hurriedly.</p>\n<p>Draco left him completely alone in Potions that day, but Harry managed to mismeasure three ingredients and knocked over his own cauldron anyway after Draco walked by and Harry saw the faint imprint of his own finger peeking just over the top edge of Draco\u2019s robe collar. \u201cPotter, you\u2019re a disaster,\u201d Draco said, standing over him after everyone had gone and Harry was cleaning up the mess, again. \u201cNot even a single jinx. I needn\u2019t have bothered sabotaging you in the first place.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, but if you hadn\u2019t,\u201d Harry started to fire back, before he swallowed the rest of it, and then Draco was catching his head under the chin and kissing him in the middle of the classroom, and then he waved his wand at the door and slammed it shut and shoved Harry forward over the table.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, yes, all right, yes, <em>yes</em>,\u201d Harry said, as Draco flipped up his robes up around his waist, jerked down his trousers, and put it to him. He did it really smoothly, in one go, top marks for speed and everything, pushing Harry\u2019s breath explosively out of him. It felt like his entire spine had liquefied.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis is really not how I pictured my seventh year going,\u201d Harry said, mostly to himself, as he shuddered underneath Draco\u2019s thrusts.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>I</em> used to imagine giving it to you in here all the time,\u201d Draco said breathlessly. \u201cSnape giving us detention, the right sort of potion, pinning you to the counter\u2026\u201d He had Harry\u2019s wrists on the table and was holding them down while his hips beat out a steady glorious rhythm against his body. Harry groaned desperately. \u201cI never thought of myself as the professor and you the hapless student, desperate to get good marks, but clearly I should have.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cClearly,\u201d Harry gasped out, and came in a rush.</p>\n<p>#</p>\n<p>\u201cSo the important thing is, I\u2019m not going to fail Potions,\u201d Harry said.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>I\u2019m</em> going to murder Draco Malfoy,\u201d Hermione said instantly.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Harry said feebly.</p>\n<p>\u201cDid he blackmail you into sleeping with him so he\u2019d pass you?\u201d Hermione demanded.</p>\n<p>\u201cUm,\u201d Harry said. \u201cNot\u2026 exactly.\u201d She folded her arms. \u201cI\u2014I think I may have propositioned him into sleeping with me so he\u2019d pass me. Sort of. Look, I didn\u2019t <em>mean</em> to, he just\u2014got the wrong idea, and\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd kept having it all the way to the end?\u201d Hermione said. \u201cWhich you reached despite being at least a hundred times the combat wizard Draco Malfoy is because\u2026?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cEr,\u201d Harry said. His face felt hideously hot.</p>\n<p>Hermione\u2019s expression went almost cartoonishly dismayed. \u201cOh, Harry, <em>no</em>.\u201d There was a bang of a door closing somewhere behind her and a murmur of Ron asking a question. \u201cHe\u2019s sleeping with Draco Malfoy!\u201d she said over her shoulder.</p>\n<p>The rest of that conversation went about as well as anyone might have expected, Harry felt, as he shut down the Floo to escape to dinner.</p>\n<p>Of course, Draco was at dinner, and afterwards he looked at Harry, and Harry looked back at him, and the end of that was they went back to his room. Harry tried to decide along the way if he had to tell Draco he <em>wasn\u2019t</em> sleeping with him for a mark. Except if he wasn\u2019t, that would leave the question of why he <em>was</em> sleeping with Draco, and Harry didn\u2019t really want to think about that question, much less answer it.</p>\n<p>Draco shut the door behind him, and Harry turned on like clockwork: it was already Pavlovian. Draco was on him, kissing him, already pushing his robes open. \u201cI\u2019m\u2014I\u2019m getting a bit sore,\u201d Harry said, between kisses.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s no good,\u201d Malfoy said, slow and drawling, and sucked on his earlobe while he pulled Harry\u2019s shirt out of his trousers. \u201cI want you <em>very</em> sore,\u201d he hissed into Harry\u2019s ear. \u201cI want you <em>limping</em>. I want to take you so thoroughly everyone\u2019s going to know you\u2019re bending over for me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry shut his mouth up tight. He was so hard it <em>ached</em>. He reached down and unbuckled his own belt and shoved his trousers down.</p>\n<p>Draco was as good as his word. Harry spent five straight hours being thoroughly fucked in a multitude of positions. By the end of it, he felt hot and sore and tender and so utterly limp he didn\u2019t think he could\u2019ve walked at all. \u201cI\u2019m sleeping here,\u201d Harry said muffled, without lifting his head out of the pillow.</p>\n<p>Draco, collapsed over onto his back next to him, flipped an incoherent hand at him: <em>fine, whatever</em>.</p>\n<p>In the morning, Harry groggily got up and did actually limp a little on his way to the bathroom. He was going to put on a Healing Charm and take care of it, but he stood over the sink staring at himself with his wand in his hand, frozen, because he wanted\u2014he wanted Draco to <em>see</em> it, to see him limping, with the very clear understanding that when Draco saw it, he\u2019d fuck him again instantly, wildly, and Harry almost couldn\u2019t breathe for the wave of lust that rolled over him.</p>\n<p>So he went back out after he was done washing up, before doing anything, and Draco\u2019s eyes were open, and he did see, and not a minute later Harry was sprawled across the bed with his legs over Draco\u2019s shoulders, getting it <em>again</em>, a feverish kind of blurring of pleasure and pain. \u201cOh, God, ow,\u201d Harry moaned, his hips jerking involuntarily. \u201cOw. Come on, Draco, <em>harder</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, <em>God</em>,\u201d Draco said, a kind of desperate whine in his voice, too, and somehow did manage to go at him even harder, until Harry just went over on the knife\u2019s edge, and then Draco pulled out and came all over him. Harry\u2019s legs thumped off Draco\u2019s shoulders heavily. He lay breathing in gulps, limp. Draco pushed him over onto his stomach. Harry meant to say <em>no, that\u2019s enough</em>, <em>I\u2019m done, </em>but Draco didn\u2019t try to fuck him. Draco put his head down and <em>licked</em> him, and fingered him, and pushed into him with his <em>tongue</em>, and then tongue and fingers together, and it wasn\u2019t enough, it wasn\u2019t enough.</p>\n<p>\u201cTell me to,\u201d Draco said low and savagely, sliding his thumbs up and down Harry\u2019s thighs. \u201cTell me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPut it in me again,\u201d Harry said, faintly, and shut his eyes and braced himself, only Draco didn\u2019t slam into him this time, just pushed slowly and luxuriously back into him and\u2014and\u2014<em>stayed</em> there, pushed deep, Harry\u2019s whole sore body swollen tight around him and his thighs pushed apart, and Harry hadn\u2019t known you could get <em>this</em> fucked, this completely fucked, until he\u2019d spent five solid minutes just shuddering on Draco Malfoy\u2019s cock.</p>\n<p>Harry did put on a Healing Charm afterwards, but he still felt shivery and\u2014and\u2014<em>taken</em>, there wasn\u2019t another word for it. Draco came into the shower with him and slid his hands all over Harry\u2019s body, proprietary and demanding. \u201cTonight I\u2019m going to teach you to suck my cock the way I like it,\u201d Draco said.</p>\n<p>Harry choked down a laugh. \u201cYes, Professor,\u201d he said, and after one silent moment where Draco stared at him shocked, they both burst into half-hysterical laughter together, until they started kissing under the spray.</p>\n<p>#</p>\n<p>Harry stopped failing Potions. Unfortunately he started failing everything else, because he was having as much sex with Draco as humanly possible, and it wasn\u2019t leaving him much of either time or brainpower. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have told you, should I,\u201d Luna said to him after lunch one day. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Harry.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTold me\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAbout Draco,\u201d she said. \u201cI didn\u2019t realize it was you, too.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat? No, we, I\u2014\u201d Harry said, and then just fled. He still maintained the desperate hope that no one else knew, right up until the day McGonagall cornered them after dinner and said severely, \u201cProfessor Malfoy, Auror Potter, I would not have thought I needed to remind two grown wizards that the corridors of Hogwarts are not an appropriate place for <em>snogging</em>\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou <em>don\u2019t</em>,\u201d Harry moaned, in horror. He hadn\u2019t <em>meant</em> to, really, they\u2019d just bumped into each other that day by accident. Next to him, Draco was rigid and flushed with mortification.</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2014but as it seems I <em>do,</em>\u201d she went on, with a militant look in her eye, \u201cI will thank you both to restrict your extracurricular relations <em>to your rooms</em>. And I think, Professor, perhaps we had best recuse you from marking Auror Potter\u2019s work henceforth,\u201d she added, tartly.</p>\n<p>\u00a0They both stood frozen, staring after her as she sailed away, taking all their excuses with her. \u201cThat witch has had it in for me since I was eleven years old,\u201d Draco said bitterly. \u201c<em>Fine.</em> Are you coming or not?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, all right,\u201d Harry said hopelessly, accepting his doom.</p>\n<p>#</p>\n<p>He spent the holidays with Ron and Hermione trying really hard to convince himself that he wasn\u2019t missing Draco, and failing. Hermione was determined to save him, so she set him up on half a dozen blind dates and refused to take no for an answer. \u201cI blame myself, letting you get away with it this long,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you hadn\u2019t been brutally deprived, he couldn\u2019t have seduced you in the first place.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m fairly sure <em>I</em> seduced <em>him</em>,\u201d Harry said, but that didn\u2019t get him out of it. He went on one date after another to restaurants and clubs, tried to make conversation, danced a bit, and even got kissed a few times. It was no use. He was about as interested as if he\u2019d gone out with a mannequin. They were all\u2014nice. He couldn\u2019t imagine any of them shoving him up against\u2014</p>\n<p>\u201cPotter?\u201d</p>\n<p>He jerked his head up from the drink he was nursing at the bar, waiting for the next date to show up, and stared at Draco, who had two drinks in his hands. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d Harry blurted.</p>\n<p>Draco looked over at a table in the back, a slim, good-looking wizard waiting, and then he looked back and said flatly, \u201cYou.\u201d</p>\n<p>He turned just as Harry\u2019s date showed up, and shoved both the glasses into the guy\u2019s hands. \u201cHis name\u2019s Roger, he gives magnificent head,\u201d he said to the startled wizard, jerking his head towards the wizard at the table, and then he turned round, grabbed Harry by the wrist, and towed him away up the stairs into a dark corner where he did, in fact, shove Harry up against the wall, jerked his robes out of the way, and bit him on the back of the neck while he fucked him.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, please,\u201d Harry groaned, and afterwards they staggered off and found a dark quiet table and spent the rest of the night just necking until the place closed, and then they went to a hotel room and had sex again.</p>\n<p>\u201cHermione\u2019s going to kill me,\u201d Harry said glumly the next morning.</p>\n<p>\u201cMillicent is going to kill <em>me</em>,\u201d Draco said. \u201cAnd she\u2019s actually <em>got</em> assassins.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWas that the next step?\u201d Harry said fatalistically. \u201cI\u2019ve almost been expecting it.\u201d \u00a0</p>\n<p>Draco sat up abruptly and ran a hand through his hair. There was something odd in his expression, his mouth turning down and almost trembling, and Harry stared at him. Draco didn\u2019t say anything for a moment, and then abruptly he spat, some real misery cracking out of him, \u201cGo to hell. Do you really blame us for trying? It\u2019s that or just give up and go, isn\u2019t it? My family\u2019s been here for a thousand years, but I ought to just accept it gracefully and move on, of course.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry pushed himself up on an elbow. \u201cWhat are you talking about, Malfoy? Nobody\u2019s chasing you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco laughed sharply. \u201cIs that supposed to be a joke? And what do you call this ten-year crusade you\u2019ve been running to purge every pureblood house in the country\u2014no excuse too small, no fine too large? Wizards banged into Azkaban on charges of possession of Dark artifacts, for having a knife on the wall someone used in the first Elizabeth\u2019s reign, or a case of potions from the banned list that someone\u2019s great-grandfather laid down in case of German invasion? The ban on black asphodel?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat on Earth\u2014? That\u2019s not\u2014black asphodel smoke produces nausea and violent hallucinations if Muggles inhale it!\u201d Harry said, bewildered\u2014that had been Macmillan\u2019s bill, hadn\u2019t it? He only remembered because of the absolutely furious resistance Bulstrode\u2019s crew had put up over it. \u201cIt\u2019s not some plot to <em>get</em> you\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco looked at him, incredulously. \u201cOh, of <em>course</em> not. There\u2019s been a dozen recorded cases of inhalation in the last century, but naturally this desperate health crisis had to be addressed with the most aggressive measures at once. It\u2019s nothing to do with the fact that half the old houses have Tartarean ovens from the seventeenth century, and it costs a hundred thousand Galleons to replace the works.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry stared at him, and Draco gave a snort. \u201cIn case you\u2019re keeping a tally, you got twelve families in a shot with that one. Including the Parkinsons. Gringotts wouldn\u2019t give them a loan, of course\u2014the goblins can see the writing on the wall as well as anyone. I offered to lend it to them personally, but Eddard wouldn\u2019t take it. He said he couldn\u2019t see any chance of paying it back, the way things were going, and if the inspectors afterwards found some excuse or other, he\u2019d spend his declining years in a prison cell. So they shut up the house and moved to Germany\u2014and so goes a family line that\u2019s been here since the Dark Ages. And even then, your inquisitors stopped them at the port and went through every scrap of their luggage. Pansy wrote that her underthings were strewn across the pier by half a dozen smirking Aurors, as though her brassieres were likely contraband.\u201d</p>\n<p>He stopped talking, looking away, his jaw clenched tight and his hands clenched tighter in his lap. He shoved back the covers and got out of bed. His back was still scratched up red, shoulders marked with bruises where Harry had held on, drunk with it.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou think\u2014you really think we\u2019re deliberately trying to drive you all out?\u201d Harry said, almost blankly, staring after him. It was the sort of thing <em>they</em> would\u2019ve done, of course\u2014</p>\n<p>Draco was pulling on his robes. \u201cWell, Potter, if you\u2019re not <em>trying</em>, it\u2019s a remarkably successful campaign for being unintentional,\u201d he said over his shoulder, without turning round, a cold sneer in the words. \u201cAnd I suppose you just didn\u2019t notice half the Slytherin tables standing empty? Seats opening up in the Wizengamot by the dozen? But of course, it wouldn\u2019t stop you if you had. You\u2019re just doing your <em>job</em>, aren\u2019t you\u2014clearing out all the vicious Dark wizards, a threat to all good little Gryffindors and friends. Poor old Arkendale held out against you as long as he could, but the mediwizards flat-out told him he\u2019d be dead in another month if he didn\u2019t retire, and his daughter\u2019s already gone.\u201d</p>\n<p>It was like looking at the whole world through a twisted mirror. \u201cIf you really believe that,\u201d Harry said, breathlessly angry suddenly, \u201cif that\u2019s what you really think I\u2019m after, what are you doing <em>here</em>?\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco gave a short hard burst of laughter. After a moment he said, \u201cWhen Millicent begged me to take the post at Hogwarts, stop you passing if I could, I told her there wasn\u2019t a chance of it. McGonagall was never going to let me block you from the appointment. At best, we might have squeezed out an extra month or two of wrangling\u2014a little more time for people to salvage what they could before the curtain comes down. But really, we both knew it was just a bit of petty vengeance. It <em>is</em> selfish of me to trade it for this, I suppose, but Millicent will have to forgive me. When I\u2019m living in France this time next year, at least I\u2019ll have the satisfaction of remembering you begging me for it.\u201d</p>\n<p>He walked into the bathroom and slammed the door behind him without ever looking back around.</p>\n<p>#</p>\n<p>Harry banged out of the hotel seething, and went for a walk down Diagon Alley to clear his head. Of all the\u2014for Draco to turn around and treat <em>him</em> like a persecutor, like <em>he</em> was the one who\u2019d ever been out to get other wizards\u2014yeah, of course he\u2019d wanted the Dark ones behind bars, the monstrous artifacts cleared out, like any sane person would. That wasn\u2019t the same as being out to <em>get</em> all the Slytherins. Oh, the poor Parkinsons, having to replace the antiquated boiler in their country manor so it didn\u2019t poison Muggle kids nearby when it backed up. And of course if they couldn\u2019t afford to do it, their only other choice was to flee the country, instead of taking a smaller house and living like only ordinarily rich people.</p>\n<p>He was so angry he was walking fast, barely looking where he was going, and it didn\u2019t register at first that it was getting dark around him until it started to get cold, too, and he stopped and looked round in surprise. He\u2019d come all the way down Diagon Alley to the end where the last streetlamp stood, and the cobblestones tapered off into the mists. It hadn\u2019t felt like he\u2019d walked nearly that long. He turned round and went back towards the lights and shops, still seething, but long before he reached the lights again, he started to notice he was passing shops on either side, shut up and gone dark, but not quite faded away yet. <em>Glimmerglass Fine Jewelry</em>. <em>Wadlington\u2019s Wizard Wear</em>. <em>Quaffing\u2019s Rare Vintages, </em>with a sign in the window saying <em>all stock must go! 75% off all cases!</em></p>\n<p>Harry slowed, staring in the windows as he went by. He\u2019d never gone to any of these shops himself\u2014he only vaguely remembered them. They were too posh for him, they were the sort of places\u2014that people like Draco Malfoy went to shop.</p>\n<p>There were dozens of closed ones, and when he finally reached the edge of the open shops, there were dozens more of those crowded against the border with frantic sale notices in the windows, scarcely any customers, and shopkeepers hovering by the doors. They looked at him as he walked past, silently; one woman, packing up a box of elegant china patterned with flying hummingbirds moving in a circle around the border, reached out and shut the door with a bitter, hard look.</p>\n<p>By the time he got past those, he could already see Gringotts clearly looming up ahead, the Grand Hotel just behind it. There were some new shops sprung up also\u2014Weasley\u2019s Wizarding Wheezes was bustling like mad, and Digit Alley had split off down beside it, full of wizarding tech shops and the new internet caf\u00e9 and Modern Divining anchoring the other end, where another wall now led out to the Covent Garden tube stop. But Diagon Alley had shrunk. The busy stretch of shops was half as long as it had used to be.</p>\n<p>Harry stopped in the intersection, the bustle of foot traffic moving round him\u2014half the wizards weren\u2019t wearing robes anymore; it was Muggle clothes and trainers\u2014some of them in odd colors and slightly weird shapes, like even wizards who\u2019d grown up that way had started wearing Muggle clothes for day-to-day.</p>\n<p>He felt weird, almost sick to his stomach. He wanted to go back to the hotel and find Draco, shake him, yell at him\u2014but that was probably the idea. Hermione had it right: Draco was <em>trying</em> to mess with him, he\u2019d say anything he had to. And there wasn\u2019t anything <em>wrong</em> with shops closing, new ones opening, people wearing different clothes\u2014there wasn\u2019t. There wasn\u2019t anything wrong with any of it.</p>\n<p>Harry abruptly shut his eyes and visualized. \u201c<em>Apparate!</em>\u201d he said, and the bang took him to Dewdrop Close, to the gate of a small cottage on the riverbank.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy, Harry,\u201d Slughorn said, answering the door. He looked a bit older and greyer since the last time Harry had seen him, at his second retirement party some six years ago, but his eyes were still bright. \u201cA pleasure to see you. Whatever brings you my way?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI need to speak to you, Professor,\u201d Harry said. \u201cAbout the Slytherins.\u201d</p>\n<p>Slughorn hesitated, biting his lip. He didn\u2019t move out of the doorway at once. \u201cWell, you know I\u2019ve been retired again for years now, Harry. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s been happening in my old House.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t mean at Hogwarts, not just at Hogwarts, at least,\u201d Harry said. \u201cI mean\u2014about the Slytherins leaving Britain.\u201d</p>\n<p>Slughorn darted a look to either side, as though he was worried someone might be listening in. \u201cWell, I suppose you\u2019d better come in,\u201d he said finally, and backed inside. Harry stepped into the entry and stopped: the sitting room was full of boxes, and half the shelves were empty.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>You\u2019re</em> going, too?\u201d Harry said, barely able to choke the words out. He wheeled round. \u201cProfessor, <em>you</em> can\u2019t think\u2014<em>you</em> don\u2019t believe we\u2019re trying to run the Slytherins out! You certainly can\u2019t think we\u2019re after <em>you</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, I, that is,\u201d Slughorn said, and then he heaved a sigh. \u201cOh, Harry,\u201d he said. \u201cCome, sit down, I can still make us a cup of tea. I\u2019m not leaving until the end of the week.\u201d</p>\n<p>But he <em>was</em> leaving. \u201cIt\u2019s not that I\u2019m personally vulnerable, of course,\u201d he said. \u201cNaturally I don\u2019t have any Dark artifacts lying about\u2014well, there are certain Potions ingredients that are\u2014but I\u2019m not concerned on that score, not in the least. If any of the more overzealous Aurors ever came round to pester <em>me</em>, I should have called you at once, of course. But no, my dear boy, in my case, it\u2019s simply\u2014the money, I\u2019m afraid.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe money?\u201d Harry said.</p>\n<p>\u201cNot to put too fine a point on it, in six months\u2019 time, you\u2019ll be taking office. And five hundred wizarding properties are going to come on the market at once, as the rest of the old lines leave.\u201d Harry stared at him, and Slughorn shrugged helplessly. \u201cIt\u2019s already next to impossible to give away a set of wizarding china, you know. I have to go now, when I can still sell my little house\u2014it\u2019s going to a nice young Muggle family, as it happens.\u201d He sighed, his face sagging a bit, and looked suddenly much older. \u201cBelieve me, Harry, I don\u2019t like the idea\u2014moving to Spain, at my age! But\u2014well. Half the shops I used to frequent have closed. The last of my favorite restaurants has announced it has four months left on its lease, and they can\u2019t afford to renew. Many of my friends have already left.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry swallowed. He couldn\u2019t imagine Slughorn making all this up. Five hundred wizarding families leaving at once\u2014another quarter of Diagon Alley was going to fall straight off into the dark. He thought of Hogwarts: a tiny handful of kids left sitting alone at the Slytherin table. No one would ever be sorted into it again, surely; any clever kid would look at the empty tables and tell the Sorting Hat <em>anywhere but Slytherin</em>, and the Hat wouldn\u2019t make them go.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat can I do?\u201d Harry said. \u201cProfessor, there\u2019s got to be some way to stop it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Slughorn blinked at him in a vaguely surprised way. \u201cWhat\u2019s that? Stop\u2014stop it?\u201d He sounded baffled, and Harry said, in slow horror, \u201cYou <em>do</em> think it was on purpose.\u201d</p>\n<p>Slughorn looked awkward. \u201cWell\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou think I\u2019d try to run every Slytherin out of their homes, out of the <em>country</em>?\u201d Harry said. \u201cProfessor, you <em>know</em> me\u2014I\u2019m not\u2014I don\u2019t believe in that purebloods-are-better rot, that doesn\u2019t mean I <em>hate</em> purebloods! <em>Ron</em> is pureblood! My dad was pureblood!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHarry, Harry!\u201d Slughorn said, making slightly alarmed calming motions with his hands. \u201cHarry, of course I didn\u2019t think\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy would I do something like that?\u201d Harry said. \u201cWhat possible reason\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBecause of the property!\u201d Slughorn said, and Harry stopped and stared at him. \u201cEveryone on your side is already starting to be able to scoop up old estates on the cheap. It\u2019s only by selling to Muggles that anyone can get a decent price even now, and a little bird tells me that Gringotts mean to prohibit the repayment of mortgages with pounds, very soon.\u201d</p>\n<p>There was a hard sick knot in Harry\u2019s throat. \u201cWhy\u2014\u201d he tried to clear it. \u201cWhy would they?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell\u2014once the rest of the Slytherin faction are gone, your side will take a majority in the Wizengamot, and naturally they wish to recommend themselves to the coming administration,\u201d Slughorn said, and then, \u201cHarry, are you all right? Perhaps a drop of firewhisky\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>#</p>\n<p>Harry banged on the Manor gates every few minutes, the two ravens sitting on the top glaring at him watchfully. They\u2019d croaked out, \u201cWarrant? Warrant?\u201d when he\u2019d first arrived, and the gates had refused to so much as budge.</p>\n<p>Twenty minutes later, once Harry picked up a rock and started just bashing continuously at the metal, Draco finally showed up on the other side. \u201cWhat do you want, Potter?\u201d he said flatly. \u201cYou can\u2019t possibly imagine that I\u2019m going to let you in here.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIf I resigned, would that do it?\u201d Harry said.</p>\n<p>Draco stared at him. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIf I resigned!\u201d Harry yelled at him. \u201cWould that stop everyone going?\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco paused and then said, \u201cYou really <em>didn\u2019t</em> know.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>No</em>,\u201d Harry snarled. \u201cAnd if any of you had so much as said a <em>word</em> to me, sooner\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, <em>shut it</em>, Potter,\u201d Draco hissed. \u201cAs though you\u2019d have given me or Millicent the time of day, if we showed up in your office complaining about Aurors giving Slytherins a hard time. You lunch with Ernie Macmillan once a week. All the people reading in those bills, buying up our houses, they\u2019re your <em>friends</em>. And <em>we\u2019re</em> the sly, loathsome purebloods who lined up behind Voldemort: good riddance, if we did go.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry swallowed hard, hearing Ron\u2019s voice in his head: <em>wouldn\u2019t that be nice</em>. \u201cFine,\u201d he said, harshly. \u201cMaybe I wouldn\u2019t have listened. But I\u2019m listening now, so what is it going to be: do you want to flounce off to France for the rest of your life, or are you going to help me <em>fix it?</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco scowled and folded his arms over his chest. \u201cAnd what exactly did you have in mind? Your resignation won\u2019t do anything, not at this point. The entire Auror Division is all your people; if it\u2019s not you, it\u2019ll be Weasley or Abbott or whoever is next down from you, and no one\u2019s going to expect better from them.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry shoved his hands into his hair. \u201cThen we\u2019ll have to make them expect better from me,\u201d he said abruptly.</p>\n<p>Draco snorted. \u201cShall I call round to all my friends and say you\u2019ve had a change of heart? Half of them will decide I\u2019ve lost my mind, the other half will decide I\u2019ve made some sort of deal with you to escape prosecution for something.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Harry said. \u201cYou\u2019re going to call round to all your friends and tell them\u2014tell them you <em>have </em>found a way to keep me at Hogwarts. For at least an extra year.\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco blinked.</p>\n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s no other Slytherin professors at school,\u201d Harry said. \u201cNobody else in your crowd knows we\u2019re seeing one another\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re not <em>seeing</em> one another\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShut up, yes we are!\u201d Harry said, and Draco scowled but didn\u2019t try to argue any further. \u201cThe point is, no one in your set has a reason not to believe you. They\u2019ll want the extra time, won\u2019t they? And then\u2014\u201d He paused, thinking hard. \u201cThere\u2019s got to be an amnesty. No, you\u2019ve got to <em>sneak through</em> an amnesty,\u201d he amended. \u201cYou lot, you\u2019ve all got to feel like you\u2019re putting one over on the rest of us or something. But I\u2019ll get Shacklebolt and Arthur Weasley to vote it through. Something so you can\u2019t be prosecuted just for possession of Dark artifacts, it\u2019s got to be used for a crime. Within the last ten years. And\u2014what else?\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco was staring at him through the bars of the fence. After a moment he said slowly, \u201cIf you let people deduct the cost of modernizing their houses from the death duties\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco did let him through the gate, eventually, and they spent the rest of the day in the Manor library coming up with a plan, a line of breadcrumbs to lure the Slytherins back to their nests. \u201cBut we\u2019re not going to get the time for this to work without some explanation for why you\u2019re going to be staying on <em>another</em> year,\u201d Draco said. \u201cMillicent\u2019s not stupid, Potter, she\u2019s not just going to take my word for it, and there really is virtually nothing I can do that McGonagall couldn\u2019t override, even <em>before</em> she\u2019d excused me from evaluating you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat if I just missed the N.E.W.T.?\u201d Harry said.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou keep fixating on the bloody exam,\u201d Draco said. \u201cNo one <em>cares</em>, Potter. Term will end, McGonagall will write you a letter saying you\u2019ve the good opinion of your instructors, and there\u2019s an end of it. You don\u2019t actually <em>need</em> the N.E.W.T.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cRight,\u201d Harry muttered. \u201cUm. What if we changed that?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Draco said.</p>\n<p>\u201cIf Shacklebolt puts through a new law,\u201d Harry said. \u201cNo more of this requiring good opinion and all that rot\u2014you\u2019ve only got to actually <em>have</em> the N.E.W.T.s required by your department for any position. It\u2019ll look like we\u2019re trying to stop you from blocking me, but afterwards, all you need to do is keep me from the exam.\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco\u2019s face screwed up into a sour expression. \u201cOf course you\u2019d want to get rid of millenia of nice, traditional favoritism in one fell stroke,\u201d he said. Harry glared at him. \u201c<em>Fine</em>, I suppose we\u2019ll swallow it, since we wouldn\u2019t be the ones getting favored anymore anyway. How precisely do I arrange to keep you from taking your N.E.W.T.?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u201cHow have you been arranging everything <em>else</em>?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI was giving my seventh-years sabotage assignments they could do instead of their homework. They\u2019ve been rather disappointed at the recent drop-off.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry snorted. \u201cFine. Get them to set something big off down in the Slytherin dungeons, just before the exam\u2014an explosion or something, the sort of thing I\u2019d go look into as an Auror\u2014</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2014and then we can trap you in the dungeons with a Time Distortion until the exam is over,\u201d Draco finished. \u201cBut McGonagall can let you do the exam later if she likes, and she certainly will like, if you\u2019ve gone and heroically saved all of Slytherin House.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat could stop her?\u201d Harry said.</p>\n<p>Draco frowned and stood up and waved his wand at the towering bookshelves. \u201c<em>Referentio!</em> Missing N.E.W.T.s examinations,\u201d and there was a low rumbling as the books shook and trembled on the shelves until twelve of them came sailing down to the desk in front of them and flipped open to different pages.</p>\n<p>\u201cRight, so it\u2019s got to be something that exceeds the limits of the Anti-Cheating Charm,\u201d Harry said, reading through the fifth one. \u201cIf it would overload the Charm to let me sit the exam late, she can\u2019t do it, not without invalidating the results of all the other students who took the test.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, so all we need to do is keep you trapped in the dungeons for a month,\u201d Draco said dryly. \u201cNot a chance, Potter: even if there <em>were</em> a spell to do it, Granger would shoot up here and blow the whole thing wide open in five minutes.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cActually\u2026 all you\u2019d need to do is keep me in there for the length of the exam,\u201d Harry said slowly, \u201cas long as the rest of the Slytherin seventh-years are in there, too.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s six of them,\u201d Harry said. \u201cSeven people with a chance to talk to other students coming out of the exam, that\u2019s too much for the Charm to handle.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThen none of <em>them</em> get their Potions N.E.W.T., either,\u201d Draco snapped. \u201cWhich you\u2019ll have just finished making mandatory for most of the jobs they\u2019ll want.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAll right, so then <em>they\u2019ve</em> got to stay another year, too,\u201d Harry said. \u201cWon\u2019t they take that trade, to buy their families more time before I take office? And six older students repeating will make up some for Slytherin having fewer students. Not to mention your Quidditch chances\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>#</p>\n<p>\u201cI must say,\u201d McGonagall said, with a thoroughly exasperated expression, \u201cI have never before had a term in which I needed to call two grown men to my office more frequently than any of the children.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSorry, Headmistress?\u201d Harry said, a bit warily.</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you indeed.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe dungeons were overrun with Shrieking Salamanders?\u201d Harry offered. \u201cThere was screaming?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI presume you have an excellent explanation for why you were lurking about the Slytherin dungeons to <em>hear</em> this screaming at the very time when you ought to have been on your way to the examination hall?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe noise was audible from my chambers?\u201d Draco said, drawling in the most insinuating way possible. Harry glared at him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>There was a cold light in McGonagall\u2019s eye. \u201cIndeed,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I presume Mr. Potter was in your chambers for the usual purposes, ten minutes before he was to sit perhaps the most crucial examination of his life?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, he is completely mad about me,\u201d Draco said, and neatly moved his ankle out of the way of Harry\u2019s kick.</p>\n<p>\u201cIn that case,\u201d McGonagall said, in deadly measured tones, \u201cI\u2019m sure that you would both be perfectly delighted if I were to invalidate the Potions N.E.W.T. and require all the students to be Obliviated and take it again, so as not to hold up the appointment of the Minister for Magical Enforcement and the entire Slytherin seventh-year class?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cEr.\u201d Harry darted a look at Draco, who just scowled and folded his arms across his chest. \u201cI\u2014I wouldn\u2019t want you to go to any special lengths?\u201d Harry said lamely.</p>\n<p>McGonagall surveyed them both with her lips pursed tightly. \u201cIn that case, gentlemen, as it seems we are going to be graced by your presence again next year,\u201d she said, \u201cperhaps it would be best if you found more private quarters. <em>In</em> <em>Hogsmeade</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ve been <em>kicked out</em> of Hogwarts,\u201d Harry said blankly, as they left her office.</p>\n<p>\u201cI suppose it was only a matter of time,\u201d Draco said. \u201cYou realize we\u2019re not going to be able to find anything remotely decent. No one\u2019s selling anymore, all the old families have started fighting to buy back in to any wizarding town.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry reached out and took Draco\u2019s hand, firmly ignoring Draco\u2019s scowl: he grudgingly let Harry have it. \u201cWe\u2019ll just have to build something new.\u201d</p>"
