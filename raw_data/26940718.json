Uncomfortable truths come out.</p>\n<p>(Or, they love Kim Dokja, no matter what form he\u2019s taken.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t know what to do with this much love.)</p>\n<p>...</p>\n<p>When he wakes up again, it\u2019s to a whole group of people, most of which are noisy and loud.</p>\n<p>He lies there in the soft blanket for a minute, taking in the details of a hospital room, and noting the IV going into the crook of his elbow. He attempts to sit up, wincing when it pulls at the mess of his chest. </p>\n<p>There\u2019s an odd weight on one of his legs, and there\u2019s a fluffy...creature resting on it, curled into his side. It\u2019s warm. </p>\n<p>The room goes quiet all of a sudden, and he finds himself staring back at an odd assortment of people.</p>\n<p>Yoo Jonghyuk\u2019s eyes are piercing.

They look him over once too, as if afraid they left a piece of him behind as well.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s been regaining his memories piece by piece\u2014not enough to form a clear picture on anything but enough to attain an echo, a shadow, a vague afterimage of who he had been (will be).</p>\n<p>Dokja remembers the feel of Unbroken Faith in his hands, how it feels to die, and watching Yoo Jonghyuk (unscarred and almost hopeful) from the windows of a subway car, but he has no context for it, no timeline.</p>\n<p>Trading fingers for Yoo Jonghyuk\u2019s happiness, wings sprouting from his back, the strange sensation of turning into a ghost, his fingers turning into wisps of smoke in a tunnel.</p>\n<p>\u201cOmniscient Reader?\u201d he reads aloud, uncertain. \u201cInteresting name for a novel.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019ve read it before,\u201d she says, eyes shining. \u201cBut I think you\u2019ll enjoy it.\u201d</p>\n<p>He flips it open, and reads the first lines.</p>",

  "text": "<p>Kim Dokja wakes up in the hospital at age fifteen after jumping off a roof and finds a woman staring down at him sadly, her hands brushing through his hair gently.\u00a0</p>\n<p>It\u2019s not his mother, but someone who moves gracefully and slowly, movements refined and elegant.</p>\n<p>He must be dreaming, he thinks. He must say something out loud because the woman smiles sadly and brushes her thumb over his cheek.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis is real, little one,\u201d she hums. Her voice has an odd sing-song quality to it. There\u2019s a man hovering over her shoulder, quiet and imposing.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s so small at this age,\u201d she whispers to him. The man nods silently.</p>\n<p>He finds himself falling back asleep. The last thing he hears before he goes to a dreamless sleep is her quiet voice.</p>\n<p>\u201cI wish we could have helped, little heir.\u201d</p>\n<p>When he wakes up again, it\u2019s to a whole group of people, most of which are noisy and loud.</p>\n<p>He lies there in the soft blanket for a minute, taking in the details of a hospital room, and noting the IV going into the crook of his elbow. He attempts to sit up, wincing when it pulls at the mess of his chest.\u00a0</p>\n<p>There\u2019s an odd weight on one of his legs, and there\u2019s a fluffy...creature resting on it, curled into his side. It\u2019s warm.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The room goes quiet all of a sudden, and he finds himself staring back at an odd assortment of people\u2014two kids, a teenager sitting with them, a broad-shouldered man with a kind face, a pretty woman with brown hair with a woman polishing a sword, one with short black hair and a beauty mark, and a man with gold eyes like nothing he\u2019s ever seen before and scars peeking out from everywhere.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Everyone stares, and he stares back at them, eyes wide. He fights the urge to shrink back under the blankets.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He must be dreaming, or they must have the wrong room.</p>\n<p>One of them says, \u201cHe\u2019s so cute as a kid,\u201d while another one mutters \u201cHow\u2019d he get those injuries anyway?\u201d</p>\n<p>Neither of those statements makes sense.\u00a0</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a moment of silence before he speaks, unwilling to let these people sit with the wrong person for another moment. How did they end up in his room anyway? He looks out the window for a moment to gather his words, but stops abruptly.</p>\n<p>This doesn\u2019t look quite like Seoul.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhere...where am I?\u201d it comes out soft, his voice hoarse from disuse.</p>\n<p>One of the two kids\u2014a sweet looking girl\u2014tilts her head. \u201cAhjussi, what do you mean?\u201d</p>\n<p>He really must be dreaming, he thinks, as he points to himself and mouths \u2018Ahjussi.\u2019 He\u2019s clearly a kid. He looks down at his hands\u2014they are small, and just as he remembers (weak and no good at stopping the bullies.)</p>\n<p>\u201cI think you have the wrong room,\u201d he says haltingly, confused. \u201cI\u2019m Kim Dokja. I\u2019m fifteen, I go to Seoul High School...\u201d</p>\n<p>The room goes deathly quiet again, and the woman polishing her sword gets this scary glint in her eye.</p>\n<p>The teenager growls. \u201cI\u2019m really going to put my sword through whichever stupid part of Star Stream decided this would be a good idea. You\u2019d think, once we reached the end, the bullshit would be over.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sword? Star Stream? Is he in a room full of Chuunis?</p>\n<p>\u201cStar Stream\u2026?\u201d</p>\n<p>The scarred man, who is unfairly good looking (protagonist, his mind whispers) looks angry. He storms out of the room, slamming the door shut behind him.</p>\n<p>The rest of the group looks rather worried, and scared.</p>\n<p>The young boy starts to say \u201cYou really don\u2019t remember anything\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>No, he doesn\u2019t, not beyond the roof and free-falling, and he really, really, doesn\u2019t want to mention that. Is this the afterlife? Did he succeed in dying after all? Did he end up in hell?\u00a0</p>\n<p>(Hell wouldn\u2019t have people that look this kind. But it could have Kim Dokja.)</p>\n<p>The woman with the brown hair must sense that he\u2019s getting agitated, because she quickly comes over and sits on the bed by his legs. Her face does something complicated when she sees his hands gripping tightly at the blanket, before it smooths out and she runs a hand through his hair.</p>\n<p>He looks up at her, mystified by her touch.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m Yoo Sangah,\u201d she tells him, slowly taking one of his hands. \u201cWhat do you remember?\u201d</p>\n<p>...</p>\n<p>It turns out he got thrown more than a decade into the future, and managed to miss the apocalypse. Or, at least, his current self did. His real self, the one who lived through the end of the world, had apparently run into one of the last remaining artifacts and been reverted back to a child\u2014of course, he thinks, that his future self would have the same bad luck.</p>\n<p>Apparently, this means he survives past 30.</p>\n<p>(He thought he was done for at 15, so this is a bit of a shock.)</p>\n<p>They\u2019d thought he\u2019d just physically (not mentally) become younger, unaware that he\u2019d been totally swapped out for 15-year-old Kim Dokja. Hence the little girl calling him Ahjussi.</p>\n<p>Yoo Sangah had dropped the fluffy creature thing into his hands and he held onto its warmth while it nudged him roughly, yelling \u201cBa-at! Ba-aht!\u201d</p>\n<p>Apparently her name is Biyoo, and she turns into a human. He finds this out when she disappears in a puff of smoke and there\u2019s a girl standing in her place.</p>\n<p>Yoo Sangah laughs at the face he makes.</p>\n<p>When he wakes up again, he finds Biyoo in human form curled into his side this time, carefully avoiding all his injuries. She sleepily blinks open her eyes when he shifts, watching him as he groggily finds the land of the living again. She shifts so that her face presses into his neck, and he freezes at the sudden contact. Her hand winds around his.</p>\n<p>\u201cSleep,\u201d she says softly, with a voice somehow weighted by a thousand years. He sleeps, warm and held.</p>\n<p>The kid looks so small, and his eyes are empty\u2014the bandages that wind around his body peak out from under the oversized sweater they\u2019d found for him.</p>\n<p>They decide to give him some space so they don\u2019t overwhelm him with years worth of friendship and trust and far too many deaths, making it so that he\u2019s never alone but that there aren\u2019t more than two or three of them with him.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s painful, seeing him this way\u2014it\u2019s too painfully close to the \u2018Most Ancient Dream\u2019. It\u2019s painful to see him young and unsure, watching them warily like he\u2019s uncertain of when they\u2019ll turn on him.</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t know why they left you with me,\u201d the lady with the beauty mark says. \u201cI\u2019m horrible with kids.\u201d</p>\n<p>He immediately feels bad\u2014he doesn\u2019t want to make trouble for her.</p>\n<p>(She sounds a bit like his relatives, arguing over having to take him in. Will she leave him too? Does she hate him?)</p>\n<p>She must see something in his face, because she closes the book in her lap immediately and sighs, coming closer till she sits on the side of his bed. She ruffles his hair gently, taking care to avoid the bandages.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you like stories?\u201d she asks.</p>\n<p>He nods quietly. Escape, they\u2019re an escape.</p>\n<p>She chuckles softly, and he thinks she mutters something that sounds like \u201cof course you do.\u201d He doesn\u2019t know why she would know that.</p>\n<p>She flips open the book in her hands again, filled with pages of handwriting he thinks might be hers.</p>\n<p>She confirms it when she holds it out in front of him and says, \u201cWant to read my new novel? It\u2019s a work in progress right now, and my current editor is\u2014\u201c she pauses for a moment, expression going unreadable\u2014\u201cunavailable. Why don\u2019t you tell me what you think instead?\u201d</p>\n<p>He carefully takes the book from her hands and opens it. She smiles widely, pulling a lemon candy from her pocket and giving it to him as well.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The two kids\u2014Shin Yoosoung and Lee Gilyoung\u2014play card games with him and laugh when he loses, but it isn\u2019t mocking. Lee Gilyoung shows him his grasshopper collection and Shin Yoosoung tells him grasshoppers are ugly and then they start squabbling, only stopped from physically shoving each other by Kim Dokja\u2019s legs in between them from where they\u2019re sitting on either side of him on the bed.</p>\n<p>Lee Jihye\u2014the teenager who\u2019d mentioned swords and the Star Stream\u2014she shoos them out when they get rowdy, telling them off for not being careful. He\u2019s still healing, she says, don\u2019t jostle him unnecessarily.</p>\n<p>The kids immediately look contrite.</p>\n<p>She sighs, rubbing her temples.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy don't you both go bother Heewon\u2014sshi,\u201d she mutters. \u201cYou can get her to decide whether grasshoppers are ugly or not.\u201d</p>\n<p>The kids reluctantly leave the hospital room, squeezing his hands before they go, and their arguing echoes down the hall as they go.</p>\n<p>\u201cGuess you\u2019re stuck with me now, squid.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSquid\u2026?\u201d</p>\n<p>She grins evilly, and he gets the feeling he\u2019s being made fun of but he doesn\u2019t know how.</p>\n<p>His injuries ache sometimes\u2014they don\u2019t ask him how he got them, just hold his hands when he pulls at the still healing ruin of his skin, gently pull him to his feet when he\u2019s deemed fit enough to walk.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The broad shouldered man, Lee Hyungsung, is there a lot when he wakes up. (It\u2019s never the scarred man with the gold eyes.)</p>\n<p>He\u2019s usually asleep in the uncomfortable hospital chairs, muttering in his sleep about cartridges and lost bullets. He\u2019s almost like a bodyguard.</p>\n<p>He smiles when he\u2019s awake at the same time as Kim Dokja, and tells him rambling stories with too many military based metaphors that he doesn\u2019t mind hearing anyway.</p>\n<p>The doctor-lady\u2014she\u2019s said her name was Aileen\u2014looks him over once more and tells him he can leave the room and stay with his family.</p>\n<p>She\u2019d called them his family.</p>\n<p>(If he thinks about it too hard he\u2019ll start to cry.)</p>\n<p>She puts her hands on her shoulders and suddenly glares at him. \u201cIf you get injured again,\u201d she growls threateningly, \u201cYou are going to be in so much trouble. I\u2019ve had to patch you up enough times over the years. It\u2019s like you\u2019ve never heard the words \u2018self-preservation\u2019 before. If it hurts too bad, or you feel worse, you let them know and you come straight. back. here. Understood?\u201d</p>\n<p>He nods, a little frightened.</p>\n<p>She smiles widely, as if she hadn\u2019t threatened him a second ago, mussing his hair.</p>\n<p>They take him to a house, and it\u2019s so lived in and warm that his head spins. All of them live in the same one, and it feels so <em>alive </em>compared to the empty, impersonal hospital room.</p>\n<p>They give him his future self\u2019s bedroom, but then they all pile in it anyway, the floor a mosaic of sleeping bags and futons they\u2019ve scrounged up. He knows they were giving him space, but apparently that rule doesn\u2019t apply at night.\u00a0</p>\n<p>In the morning, a woman with bright orange-gold hair slams into him when he wakes up, squishing his cheeks.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re so cute,\u201d she coos, holding his face. \u201cI\u2019m going to keep you, no matter what Yoo Jonghyuk says.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUriel,\u201d someone calls.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, my lovely incarnation?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to suffocate him.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI am not!\u201d</p>\n<p>She definitely is.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jung Heewon pries the woman off of him with a long suffering sigh.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The brooding man is in the kitchen when he wanders in, wondering if he can quickly grab something so he doesn\u2019t have to trouble Sangah noona (she\u2019d gone a little misty-eyed when he\u2019d called her noona for the first time, while Uriel pouted behind her.)The man goes still when he sees Kim Dokja, knife midway through cutting an onion. Kim Dokja freezes too, unsure of what to do. The man looked so angry earlier, in the hospital room. He knows that angry people can be violent, can hurt you.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>(And you can hurt them back but in the end in only ever hurts you more\u2014)</p>\n<p>The man sets the knife down and silently strides towards him, sticking out like a sore thumb in the pristine nearly all-white kitchen in his all-black clothes. He looks like a protagonist. Dokja feels like he should be afraid\u2014instead he just feels a sense of calm, like he\u2019s safe. He tilts his head upwards so he can make eye contact with the tall man, see what he\u2019ll do.</p>\n<p>The man just continues to tower over him, quietly observing. They stand like that for a half-minute, watching each other, before the tall man kneels down and stares him in the eyes. Dokja isn\u2019t sure what he\u2019s looking for. He reaches towards Kim Dokja\u2019s hands, which are twisted in his sweater, and rolls up the sleeves so he can see the bandages that wind up the length of his arms. It stings a little bit, but he doesn\u2019t let that show on his face.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Satisfied by whatever he saw, the man stares at him again. If he didn\u2019t know any better, he\u2019d say the man looked sad for a moment.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWatch,\u201d he rumbles, voice deep yet soft. He continues to dice the onions, then stirs whatever is in the pot that smells fantastic. Dragging a stool over from the dining area, he sets it in front of the stove and then, to Dokja\u2019s surprise, lifts Kim Dokja on top of it, like he weighs nothing.</p>\n<p>\u201cStir,\u201d he orders quietly. \u201cEarn your dinner.\u201d</p>\n<p>It\u2019s relaxing, watching him cut and dice and taste while stirring the pot and occasionally doing whatever other tasks he is asked to do.</p>\n<p>A half hour later, a rather harried looking Uriel and Lee Jihye skid into the kitchen.</p>\n<p>\u201cHave you seen\u2014\u201c</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ve been looking all over\u2014\u201c</p>\n<p>They both abruptly stop when they see Dokja hovering over the stove.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a pause before both of them squeal. Uriel takes out her phone and takes a picture before him or the man can relax.</p>\n<p>Jihye laughs. \u201cI\u2019m definitely telling Ahjussi about this when he returns, \u201d she snorts. \u201cThe great Yoo Jonghyuk, giving ahjus\u2014a kid cooking lessons.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yoo Jognhyuk. That must be the mans name. It\u2019s almost familiar. It sounds right, correct, like any other name would have been a mistake, a false moniker.</p>\n<p>Yoo Jonghyuk nods at the vegetables he\u2019s managed to messily dice, ignoring the two woman, who have begun crying while holding each other. \u201cGood job,\u201d he says, and for a second Dokja can feel a hand on his hair before it disappears.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Dinner that night tastes wonderful. Yoo Jonghyuk glares at him until he takes seconds, Lee Hyungsung telling him he\u2019s too light.</p>\n<p>\u201cGood soldiers need to have more meat on their bones,\u201d he says, looking rather stressed.</p>\n<p>\u201cHyungsung-sshi, he\u2019s not a soldier though. He\u2019s fifteen.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s never too early to start preparing!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWere you born in a military uniform?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201c...No?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWith a gun?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, Sooyoung\u2014sshi.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Han Sooyoung leans over to whisper in his ear. \u201cHe totally was,\u201d she says gleefully. \u201cI bet he came out of the womb talking about bullets and manuals and cartridges.\u201d</p>\n<p>Dokja laughs, and Sooyoung noona smiles at him before cackling.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lee Hyungsung puts his head in his hands.</p>\n<p>Sometimes it feels like he\u2019s struggling to fill a hole left by someone so much bigger and ingrained in these people's lives\u2014they\u2019ll slip up sometimes, reference a memory he doesn\u2019t have, a joke he doesn\u2019t have the context for.</p>\n<p>They love the old him so much, it\u2019s painful. He wonders what he did to deserve such unconditional, burning love.</p>\n<p>He hears Yoo Sangah talking to someone at night, their voice so familiar but he can\u2019t quite tell if it\u2019s the one he\u2019s thinking of, who should be behind prison bars.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s alright,\u201d Yoo Sangah says to the person just outside the door. They never come inside, but he does hear them stand by the entrance for a few minutes, quietly breathing.</p>\n<p>He never turns around to look at them, because he doesn\u2019t know what ugly thing he\u2019ll do if he\u2019s right and he\u2019s correct about the person who visits every once in a while but never where he can see them.</p>\n<p>It\u2019d be too painful for them both.</p>\n<p>They have a steady stream of visitors\u2014a white-haired lady who shakes her head when she sees his bandages and redoes them. Her name is Lee Seolhwa.</p>\n<p>An energetic blond girl, Jang Hayoung, who gives him dumplings and laughs when his eyes go wide at the delicious taste.</p>\n<p>Gong Pildu, an old man who takes one look at him and scoffs. \u201cTo think, you\u2019re like a twig. Some constellation,\u201d he snaps.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Another man, with a daughter, who nearly faints when he claps eyes on Kim Dokja. \u201cYou should think about working for Minosoft,\u201d he suggests. \u201cWhen you graduate. I bet you\u2019ll get a wonderful department head\u2014\u201c</p>\n<p>Yoo Sangah hits him over the head with a book and smiles dangerously at him.</p>\n<p>Han Myongoh swallows the rest of his words.</p>\n<p>He thinks about the words later at night, listening to the deepening breathing of the people sleeping (or snoring, in the case of Lee Hyungsung) around him.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhen you graduate.\u201d</p>\n<p>Is he going to be stuck in the body forever, a time traveler out of place? He wants his original body, he wants to be the person these people love, he wants it so badly that it <em>aches. </em>He doesn\u2019t want to be the lonely boy who jumped off the roof who\u2019s too scared to tell this family that he was so alone that he wanted to <em>die.\u00a0</em></p>\n<p>He finds himself on the roof again\u2014oh, the irony\u2014but someone else is there too.</p>\n<p>\u201cI thought they\u2019d do a better job of watching you when you\u2019re a child,\u201d Yoo Jonghyuk mutters. \u201cBut you\u2019ve always been a pain in the neck, hmm?\u201d</p>\n<p>He stares back silently, unsure of what to say.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat are you doing here,\" the man asks quietly. He follows it up with something that sounds a lot like \u2018rat bastard\u2019 but it\u2019s too quiet for Dokja to make out.</p>\n<p>He opens his mouth to try to answer the question.</p>\n<p>Yoo Jonghyuk\u2019s eyes are piercing. They burn through him, straight through his paper-thin defenses and whatever doors he\u2019d managed to put up to keep himself away from the thoughts that had led him to try his luck in the afterlife.</p>\n<p>Reader Kim, Lonely Child Kim, only fit to suffer and die before he causes more pain for others.</p>\n<p>That doesn\u2019t match up with the life his older self has here, doesn\u2019t match up with his carefully constructed barriers and self-imposed apathy, doesn\u2019t line up with being so fundamentally <em>unloved.\u00a0</em></p>\n<p>Reader Kim, somehow so broken by his mother's stories that she\u2019d written (to save him, to save him, oh the irony it is so <em>cruel.</em>)</p>\n<p>He opens his mouth to try to answer again, only to find that the words don\u2019t come and he\u2019s crying, tears leaving little dark spots on the concrete of the roof. He does it silently, the figure of Yoo Jonghyuk blurring before him.</p>\n<p>The great imposing mass of black (he hasn\u2019t seen him wear anything but black, how strange) kneels before him.</p>\n<p>\u201cDokja.\u201d</p>\n<p>He keeps his gaze on the floor, watching his tears soak into the ground.</p>\n<p>\u201cDokja, look up.\u201d</p>\n<p>The voice is commanding, and he doesn\u2019t want to make Yoo hyung mad, so he tilts his head up so they\u2019re looking each other in the eyes again, like in the kitchen.</p>\n<p>\u201cThey love you,\u201d Yoo hyung says, and it\u2019s so at odds with the earlier command that he takes in a sharp breath.</p>\n<p>\u201cThey love you. This isn\u2019t a dream.\u201d The sentences are short, clipped. They can\u2019t be real.</p>\n<p>\u201cThey really do love you, idiot. And I love you too. And so does, believe it or not, this sunfish over here.\u201d Dokja whips his head around to see Han Sooyoung leaning on the doorframe, grinning wickedly. Out of the corner of his eye, he sees Yoo Jonghyuk nod at her.</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t try to leave,\u201d she says, waving around her lollipop. \u201cThey\u2019ll lose their minds. And if you die again, well. I\u2019ll lose my mind too.\u201d The smile has dropped off her face entirely. She looks dangerous, backlit from the light behind the dirt, shadows twisting across her face.</p>\n<p>He hears the sound of Yoo Jonghyuk\u2019s clothes rustling as he stands up, sees the longer shadow he casts, then feels a soft pressure on the back of his neck. There are fingers there, gently holding him in place. The walk back off of the roof is a blank space in his mind\u2014only the feel of Yoo hyung\u2019s fingers keep him tethered.</p>\n<p>They don\u2019t take him to the room where everyone is sleeping, instead leading him to another one that he thinks might be Han Sooyoung\u2019s\u2014there are papers scattered everywhere, and a cluttered desk filled with pens, an open laptop with the screen dark. He\u2019s maneuvered into sitting on the bed. He winces when it pulls at something under the few remaining bandages.</p>\n<p>\u201cHow did you get these injuries?\u201d Sooyoung noona asks casually, deliberately making it seem like an offhand question.</p>\n<p>Again, he opens his mouth and nothing comes out. They watch him closely, Yoo Jonghyuk\u2019s fingers pressing on the back of his neck and Han Sooyoung crouching in front of him.</p>\n<p>\u201cI fell,\u201d he manages, because he doesn\u2019t want to tell them that he jumped off the roof himself, but he says it too fast and with a shaking voice.</p>\n<p>Yoo Jonghyuk says nothing, just continues to watch him with those eyes that seem to see right through him.</p>\n<p>Han Sooyoung also watches him like she knows every thought he\u2019s ever had.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He wouldn\u2019t call them affectionate like Yoo Sangah or Lee Hyunsung, or the kids, but he would still call them kind, and caring, and people he is so wholly undeserving of.</p>\n<p>They don\u2019t pull away when he starts crying again, unable to stop the tears from coming. They don\u2019t leave, just look knowing and resigned and angry, but not at him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI jumped,\u201d he half-chokes out, and the grip on the back of his neck momentarily stiffens, before going lax. The pressure goes away, and suddenly there are fingers gently wiping away his tears. Jonghyuk doesn\u2019t look at him directly as he does it, instead making eye contact with Sooyoung noona, who\u2019s sitting on the floor with her knees folded up to her chest, watching them both.</p>\n<p>He feels tired, all of a sudden, like the admission took something out of him. He leans into Yoo hyung\u2019s space, then buries his head into the (very hard) chest, throwing his arms around his torso. He feels him go stiff with shock or surprise, and hears the soft gasp from Han Sooyoung. There\u2019s a moment of stillness, before fingers card through his hair and then he\u2019s pulled down so he\u2019s lying on the bed.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He loosens his hold on Yoo Jonghyuk, certain they\u2019re going to leave him here to sleep. Instead, the mattress dips a bit as the man lies down next to him, and then creaks as Han Sooyoung joins.</p>\n<p>Sandwiched between them, his tears slow down until he\u2019s just hiccuping slightly, curling into their bodies.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t do it again,\u201d Han Sooyoung whispers, pushing his hair out of his eyes. \u201cYou have things worth living for. Your father hurt you, I know\u2014\u201c</p>\n<p>His eyes snap up to hers, because how could she know about the bruises and the knife and his mother wilting\u2014<br><br></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>His future self must have told them.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cBut you overcame it all, Kim Dokja. Don\u2019t let these ghosts haunt you anymore.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yoo Jonghyuk shifts so that there\u2019s a gentle press of fingers to his neck again.</p>\n<p>They fall asleep together, Han Sooyoung and Yoo Jonghyuk on either side of him, arms thrown across him like they\u2019d never let him go.</p>\n<p>In the morning, he wakes up to see Uriel watching them sleep. It looks like she\u2019s crying, and she has her phone out again. Yoo Jonghyuk wakes up when the camera shutter goes off, pulling out an entire sword (from where?) and pointing it at her, eyes narrowed and practically glowing with anger.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThis is going to be my lock screen,\u201d Uriel sobs, and shoves Yoo Jonghyuk aside so she can hug (suffocate) Dokja again, pushing Han Sooyoung off the bed in the process.</p>\n<p>The commotion causes the rest of the house to wake up, and there\u2019s brief panic where the occupants of the other room realize they lost Kim Dokja and then find him in Uriel\u2019s arms.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>(Jung Heewon extracts him from her grip again.)</p>\n<p>The next day, he finds Han Sooyoung at the laptop he\u2019d seen earlier, holding a manuscript with tons of markings in red ink. The markings look similar to his own handwriting, and he puts the pieces together.</p>\n<p>\u201cWas I your editor, Sooyoung noona?\u201d</p>\n<p>She looks startled at the usage of the honorific, and even more so once she manages to piece together what he\u2019s said.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, yeah you were. You leave the most annoying comments, you know?\u201d</p>\n<p>Her face goes downright murderous. \u201cEven your comments on Ways of Survival\u2014\u201c</p>\n<p>She cuts herself off abruptly. Strangely, she grabs him by the shoulders and looks him dead in the eyes. (A lot of people have been doing this lately, haven\u2019t they? Like they wish they could drill lessons into his head.)</p>\n<p>(<em>Self-preservation</em>, Aileen had said.)</p>\n<p>\u201cKeep writing your comments, ok? Sure, they\u2019re annoying as fuck\u2014\u201c</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a yell from the room across the hall that sounds like Yoo Sangah saying \u201cLanguage!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2014but don\u2019t stop. You love stories, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p>\n<p>She looks a little desperate, a little manic, so he nods. And he does love stories.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>For some reason, they all avoid the subway. They take him for grocery shopping but they never use the subway, either getting in a car or walking. They act like there are ghosts at the station.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Uriel and Lee Jihye try to teach him how to hold a sword. It goes about as well as expected\u2014he nearly disembowels himself before Heewon noona, who happened to be walking by, wrenches it out of his grasp and turns it on Uriel and Ji-hye\u2014sshi. She has fire in her eyes.</p>\n<p>But before that happens, he manages to go through a few sword forms.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Uriel smiles at that, though she looks a little sad. \u201cUnbroken Faith,\u201d she says quietly. When he tilts his head in confusion, she chuckles, draping herself over his shoulders and correcting his stance. \u201cIt was the name of your sword, before you broke it. Really powerful-sounding, right?\u201d</p>\n<p>She sounds different, weighted by a thousand years and burning like fire.</p>\n<p>Unbroken Faith, huh.</p>\n<p>Jihye\u2014sshi (he calls her that mostly to annoy her, there had been a quite loud confrontation when he hadn\u2019t called her noona\u2014she isn\u2019t that much older than him though, so why would he?) goes quiet while watching them.</p>\n<p>Then he messes up the stance and nearly impales himself by falling on the sword and Heewon noona is there and there\u2019s a lot of yelling.</p>\n<p>Ji-hye grabs his hand while Uriel is busy getting yelled at, and the two of them escape.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, little squid,\u201d she laughs. \u201cShe\u2019s going to be so mad at us later.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cJi-hye\u2014sshi, you\u2019re going to be in trouble too.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNoona, Jihye-noona, why do Sangah-sshi and Heewon\u2014sshi get to be noona and I don\u2019t?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThey don\u2019t call me \u2018squid\u2019 and they\u2019re way past high school.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe fucking apocalypse delayed my graduation, ok.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOk, Jihye\u2014sshi.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m really going to strangle you, but you\u2019d probably just smile, you bastard.\u201d</p>\n<p>Her expression goes unreadable, like a lot of the people in this house when they step on accidental land mines around him\u2014what did he do, he wonders, that they get so scared about the mere idea of him dying?</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re so stupidly self-sacrificing,\u201d she mutters, sliding down the wall so she\u2019s sitting with her knees pulled to her chest.</p>\n<p>Jung Heewon arrives, radiating anger, but deflated when she sees the two of them. As if oblivious to her presence, Jihye continues talking.</p>\n<p>\u201cI mean, Ahjussi, would it have killed you to let us know what you were doing? To try and find an alternate plan? And then you got and dream of a world where you don\u2019t fucking exist and\u2014\u201c</p>\n<p>\u201cJi-hye.\u201d</p>\n<p>Heewon noona interrupts firmly. Something about her tone reminds him of <em>justice, </em>and <em>judgement.</em> She reminds him of Uriel a bit.</p>\n<p>\u201cJi-hye-ah, go find Sangah\u2014sshi, alright?\u201d</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a pause, where Dokja isn\u2019t sure if she\u2019ll leave and he wonders how the atmosphere shifted so quickly. She does leave, squeezing his hand before she goes but not meeting his gaze.</p>\n<p>Heewon noona watches her go before turning to him, tugging at his sleeve so they both are sitting against the wall.</p>\n<p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t let Uriel and Ji-hye teach you sword fighting without an actual <em>responsible </em>adult,\u201d she huffs, \u201cor I will die of a heart attack prematurely. Then I will haunt you forever as a ghost.\u201d</p>\n<p>He nods, a little scared.</p>\n<p>\u201cYour future self,\u201d she starts, \u201cis a royal pain. I\u2019m sure Jonghyuk\u2014sshi has mentioned it already. Ji-hye, and honesty everyone, are still coming to terms with some of that, ok?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou have this annoying habit of being invincible and yet somehow we are all still afraid that you\u2019ll die.\u201d</p>\n<p>She grabs his hands.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo more self-sacrifice,\u201d she half-growls at him, \u201calright? You so much as get a paper cut that could have been avoided and I\u2019ll make you wish you did fall on that sword.\u201d</p>\n<p>He nods faster, very very afraid.</p>\n<p>He gets the feeling she\u2019s not talking to him, not really, but to the person he will become.</p>\n<p>\u201cGood.\u201d</p>\n<p>Then she gives him and the other kids dumplings.</p>\n<p>The kids play with him a lot, so unlike the bullies of his middle school and early high school days. They make it their personal mission to show him as many bugs and animals as they can. Sooyoung noona, on the rare occasion that she\u2019s the one watching them, comments that they should show him a rat so he can have another brother.</p>\n<p>Lee Gilyoung hurls a throw pillow at her and Shin Yoosoung turns her innocent face towards the writer, practically radiating disappointment.</p>\n<p>Sooyoung noona actually looks a bit guilty under Yoosoung\u2019s disappointed glare.</p>\n<p>\u201cI tamed a dragon,\u201d the girl tells him. He goes starry-eyed. \u201cYou helped, actually,\u201d she continues. He goes even more starry-eyed.</p>\n<p>Lee Gilyoung crosses his arms over his chest and huffs. \u201cWell I helped you first, in the subway with my grasshoppers.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGrasshoppers in the subway?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah! And I even controlled a giant bug for you later!\u201d He sticks his tongue out at Yoosoung. \u201cIsn\u2019t that better than a lame dragon?\u201d</p>\n<p>Dokja squirms under the weight of their stares, before saying that he likes both and they\u2019re both very cool.</p>\n<p>Biyoo tsks from where she\u2019s laying on the couch watching them. \u201cHave them fight each other for dominance,\u201d she says, idly flipping through TV channels. \u201cWe need to know which one is your favorite child.</p>\n<p>He assures them that they\u2019re probably both his future self\u2019s favorite before Lee Gilyoung can figure out how to use grasshoppers to commit murder.</p>\n<p>One of the things that\u2019s so surprising, he thinks, is how well they know him and how they effortlessly handle him.</p>\n<p>Earlier, in the hospital, they\u2019d sat with him while he ached (his body and his mind) and just been there with him. Biyoo curling into his space, warm and careful.\u00a0</p>\n<p>A warm hand in his hair.</p>\n<p>Falling asleep with someone in the creaky hospital chair next to him and waking up to someone else flopped onto it.</p>\n<p>They\u2019re also all really odd. Some of them carry swords sometimes, and it draws weird looks. They seriously, seriously avoid the subway.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Yoo Jonghyuk is scarred, his hands a mess of scar tissue and silvery lines. Before they sleep, he\u2019ll trace them sometimes, gold eyes unreadable and his gaze somewhere far beyond the room packed with sleeping bags. He wonders how he got them\u2014there seem to be entirely too many for one lifetime.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Sometimes, when he wakes up in the middle of the night, he\u2019ll find either Han Sooyoung or Yoo Jonghyuk staring around him.</p>\n<p>He knows there\u2019s a lot they\u2019re hiding from him, like the whispers about something they call\u00a0 \u2018The Most Ancient Dream\u2019, and how he's died for them over and over to get to the ending, something about Yoo Jonghyuk living a hundred, a thousand lives, something about The Demon King of Salvation \u2014all their slip ups are adding up and giving him a glimpse of his future self.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>His future self seems to have caused them a lot of grief.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>(But he saved them too, didn\u2019t he?)</p>\n<p>\u201cStop overthinking,\u201d Yoo Jonghyuk says into the heavy quiet. Dokja startles when he realizes he\u2019s been staring.</p>\n<p>He goes back to sleep, and dreams of turning into a ghost beneath the subway station.</p>\n<p>Yoo Jonghyuk continues to allow him in the kitchen, which is apparently a privilege. The only other person allowed to be in there when he is cooking is Jang Hayoung, although he personally thinks it\u2019s because he couldn\u2019t convince her to leave.</p>\n<p>His scarred hands are graceful as he chops, slices, minced, a thousand tasks happening at once. He\u2019s a lot less angry looking and stand-offish than he\u2019d been when Kim Dokja first met him at the hospital. He\u2019s quiet, and rarely gets out sentences with more than three words, but he finds himself drawn to the man anyway. There\u2019s something comforting there.</p>\n<p>The man has also taken to shadowing him at times, silent as the grave and hardly noticeable until he shifts. Sometimes they just sit together in silence, him reading over Sooyoung noona\u2019s manuscripts and the other sharpening his sword.</p>\n<p>Everyone who passes by when this happens smiles (even Ji-hye, although she looks jealous).\u00a0</p>\n<p>He thinks he knows why his future self loves them, and loves Yoo Jonghyuk.</p>\n<p>He loves Yoo Jonghyuk because he is strong, has lived through countless perils and come out on the other side. Someone he wishes he could be, not someone who gave up. He wants to be that strong.</p>\n<p>They\u2019d found out that the de-aging was temporary, after looking through the history of the artifact. He\u2019d return to his original age, although it could take anywhere from a week to another month.</p>\n<p>Honestly, he feels relieved. He feels guilty, depriving them of someone they love and cherish so much.</p>\n<p>He tells Shin Yoosoung as much.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019ll have him back soon,\u201d he says, smiling though it doesn\u2019t reach his eyes. \u201cI feel bad, keeping him from you.\u201d</p>\n<p>She pauses, putting aside her worksheets filled with equations so she can prop up her face in her hands, elbows resting on the table.</p>\n<p>\u201cAhjussi is Ahjussi,\u201d she says. \u201cDon\u2019t feel guilty, this wasn\u2019t your fault. <em>None </em>of it is.\u201d</p>\n<p>He gets the feeling she\u2019s talking about more than he knows.</p>\n<p>Hyungsung hyung and Yoo Sangah are probably the most calming to be around. They practically ooze peace and care.</p>\n<p>Hyungsung supervises more sword training sessions, as Heewon seems him worthy enough to be a \u2018responsible adult\u2019. He sees her sneak Hyungsung a kiss, and wonders if she might be a little biased.</p>\n<p>Sangah noona will sit next to him when they all sit together and watch a movie, periodically giving him a handful of popcorn and not minding at all when he drifts off halfway and falls asleep on her shoulder.</p>\n<p>In fact, he\u2019s pretty sure she carries him herself back to his bed.</p>\n<p>The both end up taking him for a grocery run that lasts a little longer than it should have. (Hyungsung hyung lost his wallet and they had to look for it.)</p>\n<p>When they start the trek back home from the 24/7 open mini-mart, it\u2019s dark outside and they didn\u2019t bring the car.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHow inconvenient,\u201d Yoo Sangah says, worrying her lip.</p>\n<p>He tugs at her sleeve. \u201cWe could take the subway,\u201d he says.</p>\n<p>Both her and hyung\u2019s faces drop.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe could, couldn\u2019t we,\u201d she ends up saying, thought it comes out just above a whisper and she suddenly grips his hand too tightly.</p>\n<p>So they finally do end up taking the subway that night, and both Lee Hyungsung and Yoo Sangah are gripping his hands so tightly that it almost hurts.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWe met on the subway, actually,\u201d Hyungsung hyung says. \u201cI met both you and Sangah--sshi on the subway!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd Gilyoung-ah,\u201d Sangah noona adds.</p>\n<p>They lapse into silence for a bit.</p>\n<p>\u201cHow did I meet you, Sangah\u2014sshi,\u201d he asks, because he\u2019s curious and also to fill the void that\u2019s opened up in the quiet of the subway.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh! We worked together at the same company. Han Myongoh was our boss, actually. I put salt in his coffee one day,\u201d she whispers conspiratorially. \u201cYou noticed, but you didn\u2019t say anything. He drank it, it made my whole week.\u201d</p>\n<p>She smiles at him and he smiles back.</p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t ask why they\u2019re so terrified of letting go of him, doesn\u2019t ask what tragedy took place. Instead he squeezes their hands and listens to the just-shy-of-desperate way they tell stories as their stop approaches, because he doesn\u2019t want to burden them with more pain.</p>\n<p>(Sangah and Hyungsung make eye contact over Dokja\u2019s head, and wordlessly know what each other is thinking of.</p>\n<p>\u2018The Most Ancient Dream\u2019.)</p>\n<p>\n<span>When they exit the subway, both adults turn and watch the doors close and the train leave, peering through the windows as if making sure nothing was left behind. They look him over once too, as if afraid they left a piece of him behind as well.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Han Sooyoung and Yoo Jonghyuk are waiting for them at the station--Sangah noona must have texted them to come. Standing there in the dim flickering light, they look apprehensive. Poised, as if ready to take on the world. Sangah and Hyungsung finally loosen their grasp on his hands.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>(What did they fight, all these years?)</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>What they would possibly be fighting at the subway, he doesn\u2019t know.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Dokja smiles and waves at them, and they relax slightly, Sooyoung noona lightly hitting him on the head and holding a lemon candy just out of his reach and making him reach for it until she relents and drops it in his palm. Yoo Jonghyuk\u2019s expression goes from murderous to slightly less murderous, and more bored.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHyungsung-sshi, try to be a little less absentminded, hmm?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cSooyoung-sshi, I am trying\u2026\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>He watches the station lights flicker, and listens to the barely comprehensible robotic voice announcing wait times and stop names. He watches the subway trains go by, peering into the insides as if they would tell him secrets about the future. If he goes blank enough, it seems almost familiar in a way it shouldn't be.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Yoo Jonghyuk tugs silently at his arm, almost dragging him away from the station and onto the sidewalk, and he forgets what he was thinking about.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The city is strange at night, when all the damage from the scenarios is obscured in the dark and he could imagine he was walking down the streets of Seoul the way he would have after school. </span>\n<span>Yoo Jonghyuk remains silent on the wall back, as if deep in thought, while the other three chat quietly about everything and nothing at all.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>As they walk the remaining blocks to the house, he yawns, tired. Hyunsung laughs at him, before leaning down and motioning towards his back. Too tired to think too much about the man having to carry his extra weight, he clambers on.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI did this with your older self too,\u201d he chuckles, \u201cso don\u2019t worry about being too heavy.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Hyunsung gives him a piggyback ride until they reach the house, where he deposits him on the couch where Biyoo is sleeping lightly. She shifts in her sleep, pressing her face into her neck like she\u2019d done that first day in the hospital.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Someone drapes a blanket over them, and then he knows no more.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>He wakes up to Jang Hayoung leaning over him, and he sits up abruptly, their heads smashing into each other.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNoona, why would you be so close\u2026\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhy did you react so fast, huh?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Yoo Jonghyuk walks into the room, one hand on the hint of his sword, evidently summoned by the commotion. When he sees the both of them clutching their heads he zeroes in on Hayoung, eyes questioning.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, don\u2019t worry, I just startled him, Mr. Mother hen.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNo dinner for you.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cJonghyuk\u2014sshi no! Please I\u2019ll do anything!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>He considers her, unimpressed. \u201cWatch him,\u201d he says expressionlessly, pointing at Dokja. \u201cMake sure he doesn\u2019t get into any trouble for the next couple hours.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou\u2019re relegating me to babysitting duty?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI\u2019m fifteen.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou\u2019re an infant.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNo dinner for two nights.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOkay, okay! I\u2019ll babysit.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>She looks him over. \u201cI\u2019m going to teach you how to throw a punch,\u201d she says, when Jonghyuk is out of earshot.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Ah. Of course.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Why are they so into teaching him how to fight? At least they are no swords involved this time, so he doesn\u2019t have to worry about getting yelled at by Jung Heewon and Yoo Sangah again.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>He should have known that they would destroy </span>\n<em>\n<span>something</span>\n</em>\n<span>. The shattered pieces of the table in the living room between them are proof enough.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHuh.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI didn\u2019t think it would break,\u201d Hayoung says.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Jung Heewon choses that exact moment to walk into the room, Yoo Sangah with her. They both go silent when they see the scene\u2014Dokja and Hayoung, and in between them the splintered remains of what had once been a nice table.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Jung Heewon gives them her scary smile, eyes glinting.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Jang Hayoung gives him a salute and leaps out the window.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Jung Heewon gets Hyungsung hyung to help him clean up. \u201cMake sure to avoid getting pierced by the splinters,\u201d she scolds, making sure he isn\u2019t bleeding before doing the same for Hyungsung hyung.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>They\u2019re cute together, he thinks.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>He doesn\u2019t think they\u2019re quite together-together yet, dancing around each other in a way that\u2019s incredibly obvious. She fusses over Hyungsung more than anyone else, all her fiery nature directed in his direction, but he can handle her, strong as steel.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>He makes sure to \u2018accidentally\u2019 bump into her as she leans over Hyungsung, examining his hands, satisfied when she falls into his arms.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Lee Gilyoung asks him whether he has a crush on anyone at school. (He doesn\u2019t think it would matter, when they all look right through him or when they do see him it\u2019s with eyes filled with disgust.)</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNo,\u201d he says aloud, instead of\u00a0<em>I didn't think it would ever end well.\u00a0</em></span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThen, anyone outside of school? I mean, I guess we already know your type is Jong\u2014\u201c</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Shin Yoosoung slaps her hand over Gilyoung\u2019s mouth and gives him a tight smile.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNo spoilers,\u201d she says through gritted teeth, although there\u2019s something curious in her eyes.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>He loves someone? Who? He cuts off those thoughts--if they wanted him to know they would have told him.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cChinese garters,\u201d Jung Heewon says thoughtfully, and the whole group grins.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>She laughs when he stares at her. \u201cYou\u2019ll understand when you\u2019re older,\u201d she gets out in between breaths.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>He feels whole, more whole than he\u2019s felt in years.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>The woman who comes to visit at night, face shrouded in darkness, comes by again. Yoo Sangah speaks to her softly again, and she turns to leave.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>And he feels something tug in his chest, something that feels like acceptance and forgiveness and the soft feel of a half-forgotten love.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>He tumbles out of bed and quietly runs to the door and past Sangah noona, ignoring her soft gasp to look at his mother without prison bars and glass in the way.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>She looks old. Her face is lined and her hair is long, with streaks of gray.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>They stare at each other, and her eyes fill with tears and she avoids his gaze.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cDokja,\u201d Sangah calls quietly, voice wavering.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>(Why did she take the blame? Why did she make their lives a story for everyone to read? Why why why\u2014)</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Because she loved him, and in her own roundabout way tried to save him.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>He throws his arms around her, crying into her chest. Her frame is thinner than he remembers, but she still smells and feels the same.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<span>I gave you the name Reader Kim, not Lonely Child Kim.</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<span>So, what happened next in your Ways of Survival?</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<span>I did it, Dokja. I used the knife. Okay?</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>What a poisonous, powerful love.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Hesitantly, she brings her arms around him as well, and for a minute they just hold each other, hidden in the darkness with Sangah looking on.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Lee Sookyoung says, pulling back and wiping away his tears. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>They don\u2019t have anything else to say to each other, but for now it is enough.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>He hears Sangah crying quietly too, and she holds him for a moment when his mother leaves, swaying back and forth as if she were rocking a child. She makes two cups of tea and they drink them together, sitting in the kitchen until morning.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou didn\u2019t put salt in these ones, did you,\u201d he whispers, voice hoarse.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>She snorts into her cup and replies \u201cI\u2019ll do it when Han Myongoh comes by again.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>They don\u2019t say anything about it, but his mother comes by less often in the night, but when she does she\u2019ll hold him for a moment and tell him stories, about what she did in the scenarios and the life she\u2019s been leading.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>And then he meets another mother.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cLittle heir,\u201d the woman says brightly, the man behind her silent.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>It\u2019s the woman he saw when he first woke up. The woman who had hovered over him in the hospital.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWho are you, ma\u2019am?\u201d It never hurts to be polite, especially around strangers. (Although really, everyone here is a stranger but they're more family than he's ever had, so. Who knows.)</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAh, they didn\u2019t introduce me, did they? I\u2019m Persephone, and this is my husband Hades.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The man nods, eyes almost fond.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>They\u2019d appeared while he\u2019d been helping fold and hang the laundry for drying, walking onto the balcony where he\u2019d been using the clothespins to keep the laundry from flying in the wind. They\u2019d finally decided he could be trusted to be alone (although they never left him alone for more than an hour, as if he\u2019d disappear if they left him unsupervised for too long).</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cLike the goddess and god?\u201d His eyes go wide, and he almost drops the pin in his hand.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>She laughs. \u201cYes, little heir. </span>\n<em>\n<span>Exactly </span>\n</em>\n<span>like that.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>She leans down so she doesn\u2019t tower over him, eyes sparkling.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhy do you call me little heir?\u201d He manages when his mouth works again.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou agreed to become ruler of the Underworld after us,\u201d she says, with a hand wave as if it\u2019s unimportant.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>What. The. Fuck.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>She grabs one of his hands and twirls him around. Her hands aren\u2019t quite warm\u2014a little cold if he\u2019s honest, like she\u2019s lowering the temperature of the air just by being present.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>He lets himself be spun and manipulated. \u201cYou healed well,\u201d she says happily. \u201cYou gave us all a scare, when we found you.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Hades tells her to be gentle, and that he\u2019s not a toy.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOf course not! Our son is precious,\u201d she snaps back at him, and he just smiles back.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Son?</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>He trips over a pile of laundry and nearly goes over the balcony until Hades grabs him by the back of his shirt with a sigh.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou could at least ease him into it, Persephone.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>They stay for an hour, not really interacting with the rest of the people in the house but just watching over him, telling stories with lots of holes. He knows they\u2019re avoiding things for his sake, so he doesn\u2019t ask.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Persephone runs her fingers through his hair absentmindedly, and asks about what he\u2019s been doing, giving little approving noises here and there.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThank you,\u201d he says when they turn to leave at the door. \u201cFor coming to the hospital.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Persephone looks ancient all of a sudden, like the goddess she truly is.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOf course, little heir. I\u2019d always come for you.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Uriel declares herself to be the more powerful goddess, and everyone nods to placate her.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cDokja-ah, I\u2019m still your favorite, right? I gave you the fable \u2018One Who is Loved by an Archangel\u2019 after all!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>He nods, unsure what she\u2019s talking about but unwilling to have to deal with her crying if he says no.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>He knows enough to know they\u2019re walking on eggshells around him. There are truths hiding in every story, waiting to be discovered and to hurt.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Gong Pildu teaches him how to fish, one day, yelling at him every other minute but giving a satisfied nod when Dokja manages to reel in a decent sized fish. Jonghyuk hyung cooks it for dinner.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The old man slaps him on the back before leaving.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>They celebrate Biyoo\u2019s birthday.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHow old are you anyway,\u201d he asks, curious.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>She blinks thoughtfully at him. \u201cWell over a thousand years old. At some point you just stop counting, you know?\u201d He blinks back at her, dazed. How many of these people are secretly older than Seoul itself?</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>She pops a bite of cake in his open mouth, smiling. \u201cDon\u2019t think about it too hard. Enjoy the cake.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>In the middle of the grinning, half-drunk people, she turns to him and smiles. \u201cThank you, Kim Dokja. I was going to kill you, you know, when we first met.\u201d Her face twists unhappily. \u201cI did kill you.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Oh.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cBut you saved me,\u201d she murmurs, splitting her piece of cake with her fork to take a bite.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou\u2019re incredible, you know? Your love is too much.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Her gaze goes distant as she watches the party. She nudges him with her shoulder, towards Shin Yoosoung, before clinking their glasses (full of soda) together.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cTo love,\u201d she says. \u201cTo new and happier endings.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>They get another visitor from the Underworld, a man with white hair who reeks of death. He climbs in through the window, waving maniacally when he spots Kim Dokja.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYo, Kim hyung! How\u2019ve ya been?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Jihye pulls Dokja behind her and tries to push him out the window, which leads to a screaming match between the two of them. He can see the man blushing though--he likes Jihye?</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cJihye, Persephone let me come! I promised not to hurt him. Besides, I forgave him for killing me, remember? I quite like the Underworld.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Jihye lets him ungracefully fall through the window and onto the floor. He rubs at his head where it smacked into the ground. Dokja watches the man that he\u2019s apparently killed.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI\u2019m watching you,\u201d Jihye says, keeping herself between the strange man and him.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cGot it, got it.\u201d The whitehaird man observes him for a moment, resting his chin in his hands. \u201cYou\u2019re so small!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou\u2019re very strange.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou\u2019ve always had a mouth on ya, hmm? I\u2019m guessing you don\u2019t recognize me. I\u2019m Kim Namwoon.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The man insists that he be allowed to spar with Dokja, which only happens when Jonghyuk enters and it becomes very apparent that the second Dokja is in any real danger Kim Namwoon\u2019s second lease on life will be abruptly terminated.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>He\u2019s still awkward with a sword, and he gets the sense that the man is toying with him more than anything. He loses three times, Namwoon knocking the weapon out of his hands easily.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou need to be faster,\u201d he says, and then shows him a bunch of underhanded tricks. He's rougher than the others, a little more wild and almost unhinged. Maybe that comes with being dead.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>He blows a kiss towards Jihye before he leaves, exiting through the window.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>A lot of them do that, huh.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>One night, Yoo Jonghyuk wakes up, breathing heavily and eyes flicking around the room, obviously just coming out of a nightmare.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>But when he catches sight of Kim Dokja, sitting up and watching him, he relaxes so easily that Dokja is surprised.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>He carefully steps over Shin Yoosoung and Lee Gilyoung\u2019s sleeping bags and over to Yoo Jonghyuk\u2019s.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cGo back to sleep.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cJonghyuk hyung, your hands are shaking.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cGo.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNo.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Jonghyuk mutters something that sounds like \u2018bastard\u2019, which he ignores.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>He sits in front of the man, taking in his tired eyes and the way he almost slumps back to the ground. On impulse, he leans into his chest like he\u2019d done that other night after the roof, hoping it\u2019ll calm the other man down. Again, Jonghyuk goes still, then relaxes, folding his arms around Dokja as if protecting him from the world.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Dokja says quietly, \u201cif I hurt you. The older me, I mean. Is this helping now?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Jonghyuk\u2019s grip around him tightens in response, which he takes as a yes.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Eventually, they end up sprawled on his sleeping bag, Jonghyuk eventually falling asleep. He wakes every so often, jolting out of his dreams, but relaxes when Dokja blinks sleepily at him, in his arms.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>If he was older, he\u2019d think there was something romantic about this, but there clearly isn\u2019t at the moment--it\u2019s just Jonghyuk, trying to find solace in the fact that a person he loves is alive and here.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>(Jonghyuk pushes aside all throughts of the Ancient Dream, of a fifteen year old Dokja subsiding on </span>\n<em>\n<span>Ways of Survival, </span>\n</em>\n<span>and tries to breath the fact that Dokja is alive and in his arms and here to stay. That Dokja will return to his real age.)</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Han Sooyoung wakes up first and sees them, mouth in a surprised \u2018o\u2019 before she shakes her head and smiles, like she knew this would happen.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>He braids Yoo Sangah\u2019s hair (doesn\u2019t mention he learned to do it from his mother\u2019s hair, no, this isn\u2019t the time) and she sits still while he plaits it. Her honey-brown hair is soft in his hands.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>He does it for Ji-hye too, when she collapses bonelessly on the couch, tired from her job. She complains loudly whenever he tugs in a strand by accident, but doesn\u2019t make any moves to leave. She smiles at him when he\u2019s done, rolling over so she can pull him into a hug and ruffle his hair.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI just fixed your hair, why are you messing up mine, Jihye-sshi\u2026\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cShh. Brats don\u2019t get to talk.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cTechnically, I\u2019m over thirty years old.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWell then, technically, Jonghyuk hyung is like, more than a thousand years old, punk.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201c...A thousand?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201c...Sangah\u2019s going to kill me.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Another slip up, another spoiler. But this one he has an odd, sinking feeling about.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWas I...Did I cause that?\u201d He asks carefully, shaping the words with care.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Ji-hye\u2019s face does something complicated at that. \u201cI am not equipped to have this conversation with you,\u201d she manages instead.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>(So he was. He\u2019s responsible somehow and how can they not hate him for hurting them in all these ways he\u2019s learning about how don't they blame him why\u2014)</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWow, you just admitted you can\u2019t do something,\u201d he says, just to fill the space.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cShut up, you were literally drowning yourself in guilt over something you had no control over two seconds ago.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>She grabs him by the hand, leads him to Han Sooyoung\u2019s room, and leaves him there.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHe asked about Jonghyuk\u2019s regression ability,\u201d she says casually, though her grip on his shoulders is like iron or steel.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Regression?</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Then she turns on her heel and leaves, and Han Sooyoung sighs.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI had hoped we could avoid this,\u201d she mutters.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Kim Dokja is not stupid\u2014of course he knows there are things they are hiding, when their smiles go fixed and their hands shake slightly. He himself knows that there are certain things shifted out of alignment, not quite right.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>(The empty feeling in his chest watching the last subway car go by before Yoo Jonghyuk yanked him away from it. Uriel\u2019s sad smile as he held a sword that felt unfamiliar. The way he sometimes can imagine Shin Yoosoung older and nearly feral with anger and </span>\n<em>\n<span>hurting him</span>\n</em>\n<span>\u2014)</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>He focuses back on Han Sooyoung, on the way her hands curl on the keyboard like they wish they were in motion, the way her mouth twists unhappily.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Just what had Jihye done?</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>She motions for him to come closer, getting out of her desk chair and pointing at it until he sits in it, taking a seat on the bed.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThere\u2019s a lot that happened, these past years,\u201d Han Sooyoung manages to say, when the silence stretches between them for a moment too long.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>He can\u2019t take it anymore, he needs answers.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHow did Jonghyuk live for a thousand years?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Sooyoung tilts her head back to examine the ceiling.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou gave Jonghyuk his regression ability, which enabled him to live more than a thousand lifetimes,\u201d she murmurs. When she catches sight of his face, she quickly adds, \u201cHe asked for it.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cBut he didn\u2019t know what the ability would do.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cBut he </span>\n<em>\n<span>asked </span>\n</em>\n<span>for it, Dokja. He asked for it. He waited a thousand lifetimes to come back to </span>\n<em>\n<span>you. </span>\n</em>\n<span>His sponsor.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Dokja has some idea of how the Star Stream works, and that he had been a constellation, but hearing it aloud is...too much. Sooyoung is looking at him again, reading his expression as if he were one of her novels.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHe never hated you, he just forgot you.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>(And now Dokja has forgotten him in turn.)</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The Yoo Jonghyuk prior to all the regressions, the Jonghyuk who had reached his end but was left unsatisfied, longing to know who was behind the voice that had led him for years. 0th turn Yoo Jonghyuk.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Isn\u2019t that a form of love? That Jonghyuk risked absolutely everything just to see him again--the \u2018Demon King of Salvation\u2019 who had been at his side and yet a galaxy apart for years.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>If he thinks about it he doesn\u2019t know whether it\u2019s his imagination or a genuine memory, but he thinks he knows what it had felt like, watching Jonghyuk smile as he heard Dokja\u2019s voice for the last time before restarting anew.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>She can\u2019t possibly know what he\u2019s thinking, but from the way her expression softens Dokja thinks she might have an inkling of what he\u2019s thinking about. She knows him so well\u2014ugly parts and all. She might even know him better than Sangah and Jonghyuk.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOh, Dokja,\u201d she says softly, when he feels the tears going down his face for what feels like the hundredth time.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWe lost you. Again and again, and the last time, we-\u201d Her voice broke, \u201cWe thought it was permanent. So we fought the </span>\n<em>\n<span>universe </span>\n</em>\n<span>for you, Dokja.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Sooyoung looks him dead in the eyes.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWe want to see you happy. Not burdened with stories that have long since passed.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>He continues to just sit there, staring at her, wrapping his arms around himself.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWe wanted to bring you back, we traveled to a whole new world line to bring you back,\u201d she says, voice cracking. \u201cSo don\u2019t you dare feel guilty for existing.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>She looks tired, perched on the edge of the bed.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Dokja stands up and she watches him, almost wearily. He pulls her into a hug, and it feels like hugging Jonghyuk in the nights where the man can\u2019t sleep, like squeezing Jihye\u2019s hands when she forgets he\u2019s there, like the other kids watching him like he\u2019s a star falling to Earth.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Sooyoung laughs wetly.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhat am I going to do with you, huh? Listen, sometimes, you need to learn to put your needs above others. Be a little selfish, hmm? Or at least </span>\n<em>\n<span>talk </span>\n</em>\n<span>to us.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Dokja has never been allowed to do that before\u2014but he thinks he could learn, in the circle of her arms.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>She doesn\u2019t explain beyond the Regression ability, but that\u2019s fine, they\u2019re both emotionally raw in a way that chafed.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>His memories are returning.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>He\u2019s been regaining his memories piece by piece\u2014not enough to form a clear picture on anything but enough to attain an echo, a shadow, a vague afterimage of who he had been (will be).</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Dokja remembers the feel of Unbroken Faith in his hands, how it feels to die, and watching Yoo Jonghyuk (unscarred and almost hopeful) from the windows of a subway car, but he has no context for it, no timeline.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Trading fingers for Yoo Jonghyuk\u2019s happiness, wings sprouting from his back, the strange sensation of turning into a ghost, his fingers turning into wisps of smoke in a tunnel.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>It\u2019s like he\u2019s got the contents of a puzzle box spilled out in front of him, all the little jigsaw pieces present, but he doesn\u2019t know what the full picture is supposed to be.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>He surprises them, when the memories begin to trickle back.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>He\u2019s helping Jonghyuk in the kitchen when a memory returns, a sharp-edged demon of a recollection. Jonghyuk putting his sword through Dokja\u2019s torso, the faint </span>\n<em>\n<span>schlock</span>\n</em>\n<span> loud in his ears, pain spiking before abruptly numbing. Dokja drops the small bowl he\u2019d been stirring dipping sauce in and it clatters on the counter, spilling a bit.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The man raises an eyebrow and looks faintly annoyed, before he starts to look alarmed.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI asked you to do it,\u201d Dokja says faintly, not completely sure what he\u2019s even referring to.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cDokja. What\u2014\u201c</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201c</span>\n<em>\n<span>You will be killed by the person you love most.\u201d </span>\n</em>\n<span>He says it as if he\u2019s in a trance, half on autopilot.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Jonghyuk\u2019s expression goes from murderous to horrified to deathly before freezing in an impassive mask. He places a napkin on the spilled sauce to mop it up, then places his hands on Dokja\u2019s shoulder as if trying to ground him in reality.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYour memories are returning,\u201d he says with an undercurrent of steel. When Dokja doesn\u2019t respond he taps him on the head a few times. \u201cHey. Dokja. If you can hear me, answer me, you fool.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Dokja rubs his head and looks up at Jonghyuk as if coming out of a daze, faintly confused.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI...I thought it was a dream. It was real?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201c...yes.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWell, uh, at least it wasn\u2019t permanent?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Jonghyuk\u2019s expression reverts back to murderous.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou\u2019re an idiot,\u201d he says. \u201cAre you alright?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Dokja makes an affirmative sound, turning back to the spilled bowl and mopping up the sauce where the napkin hadn\u2019t soaked it up. Junghyeok watches him, as if afraid he\u2019ll turn to dust right then and there, fists curled so tightly it must hurt.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI\u2019m fine, Jonghyuk\u2014hyung. Just was...startled.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The man stares at him for a moment, before turning back to the pots on the stove, thankfully none of which were burning.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cDo you want to tell the others?\u201d he asks, not looking at Dokja.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201c...No. I think they\u2019ll...panic. Treat me with kid gloves even more than they were before.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou are a kid.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cTechnically we are both far older than we look.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>So he doesn\u2019t tell anyone else that he can feel stories curling in his gut and the foggy memories taking clearer form in his head.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Jihye tends to snack on dried squid, especially when she\u2019s around him. It isn\u2019t until a memory of falling from the sky with tentacles only for Jihye to attempt to skewer him slots into place that he understands why she does so.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>When he watches Jung Heewon and Hyunsung together he thinks of a sword and shield.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>If he sits with Sang-ah he can remember her in Buddhist robes, or in a dark library. (And with stories spilling out of her on a hospital bed.)</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>When they fold Murim dumplings together, the motions seem familiar. Strange, how many memories have the aftertaste of Jonghyuk\u2019s cooking.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou taught me how to make them. Before. In the factory?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Jonghyuk looks surprised before he settles down into something that for him could be almost fond.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cMhm.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou should use your words more, you sound like a caveman.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cBastard.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI\u2019m fifteen, you can\u2019t call me that.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cRat bastard.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cDamn sunfish.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>They both startle when he says it. It had been like a reflex, long silent and dormant until suddenly activated. For someone who\u2019s just been insulted, Jonghyuk looked less angry and more content.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Uriel shines so brightly in his dreams, fierce and glowing with power.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Something stirs within him, and he recalls the story she\u2019d mentioned\u2014\u2018One Who is Loved by an Archangel\u2019.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>It feels like a blanket, warm and comforting.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>He\u2019s astounded by just how many memories there are\u2014it feels like there\u2019s an entire novel\u2019s worth crammed into the cracks of his brain.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>He gets pieces back of everyone and himself, snapshots of a life he has lived, will live, is living.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>He finds himself smiling when he sees the kids come up in his memories\u2014there\u2019s what feels like a thousand snippets of him holding their hands, ruffling their hair, feeling them clutching at his legs. They look a lot older now, but they feel the same.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>He remembers seeing himself\u2014bandaged and crying, as a subway car goes through a starry night sky. He remembers feeling despair, trying to pierce the child he had once been, and then himself. He remembers the feel of hands holding him back, his family screaming at him to stop.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The deaths come back first, but he\u2019s good at hiding the shock that comes with remembering being burnt alive by a dragon, even as the memory comes as he does the dishes with Jihye, letting the cold water distract him.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>If she\u2019s unnerved by his silence she doesn\u2019t say anything, just hums along to the tinny music playing on the word-down radio, flicking water droplets at him in between scrubbing at the soap suds.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>When Hyeon-seong carries him to bed after he falls asleep in a sprawl of limbs with Heewon and Uriel, it feels familiar, but he thinks there should be explosions sounding in the background.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>In his dreams he has wings but doesn\u2019t fly.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Of course, Sooyoung figures it out next.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>She\u2019d handed him a new finished chapter of her novel, and he\u2019d snarked something about how she must have finished it through her habitual plagiarism.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>She\u2019d yelled back, offended.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou\u2019ve got some nerve calling me, the greatest author of this generation, a plagiarist,\u201d she growls.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Then she stops as if frozen in place.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThat insult was too familiar,\u201d she notes. It takes her another pause to piece it together. Her eyes narrow as she watches him, before she makes the connection.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOh,\u201d she gasps. \u201cThey\u2019re returning, aren\u2019t they? Your memories?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Sooyoung\u2019s eyes are wide open, as she stares down at him. (Not too down, she was short enough that he was almost her height. She\u2019d raged about it endlessly.)</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>He nods, slowly.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>She sinks into the couch.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cFor how long?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cBits and pieces ever since I arrived. I only really started to put them together a couple days ago.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cDamn,\u201d she mutters under her breath.\u201dAm I the first to know?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cJonghyuk found out first.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>She clenches her fists, cheeks reddening with anger.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI\u2019m going to kill that bastard, how could he keep this from me!?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cSooyoung noona please calm down\u2014\u201c</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThat\u2019s it, I\u2019m going to send him to space again.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>When did Yoo Jeonghyuk go to space, he distantly wonders, before shoving it to the back of his brain with all the other insane questions so he doesn\u2019t lose his mind.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Later that night, he jerks awake, brushing away the cobwebs of a nightmare, only to notice that there are two people conspicuously absent. He blinks absently at the empty spaces Sooyoung and Jonghyuk have left, wondering what they could be doing up at this hour.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>It only takes a couple seconds before he hears them shouting at each other. (It reminds him of the days when his father would argue with his mother until the moon was the only bright thing in the sky, when he would lie awake wondering if it would escalate to violence or if his mother would manage to appease his father.)</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>He crawls out of the soft bed and stares at the empty futon that Jeonghyuk usually occupies. (Or that they both occupy, when either of them has a night bad enough that they can\u2019t sleep without the warm presence of each other.)</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The yelling from the other room reaches another crescendo and he flinches (thinking of shattered soju bottles and his mother, bruised\u2014) before making up his mind to get up and go to them.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>They fight often, like a cat and a dog, usually pulled apart by Sangah.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>He pokes his head into the doorway, watching as Sooyoung jabs her finger in Jonghyuk\u2019s face during her tirade.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Jonghyuk doesn\u2019t budge an inch. He\u2019s like a stone pillar, towering over her.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHe told me not to tell anyone,\u201d he growls, when Sooyoung\u2019s voice reaches a new pitch. \u201cI promised him. I\u2019ve left him enough times, caused enough problems. Maybe I wanted to do it right this time.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>That\u2019s the most words Dokja has ever heard Jonghyuk say at once, and he feels the weight of them like an anchor tied to his ankles.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Sooyoung\u2019s hand falls from where she\u2019d been waving it around and lands with a soft </span>\n<em>\n<span>thump</span>\n</em>\n<span> on his chest, as the fight goes out of her.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Her voice, when she speaks again, is subdued.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou should know better than to trust that bastard to know what\u2019s good for him\u2014apparently he has even less survival instincts at fifteen than he did at thirty.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Based on his limited memories, he can tell that\u2019s quite the accomplishment.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cSooyoung.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhat, you traitor.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou\u2019re going to show it to him, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>She takes two lemon candies out of her pocket, and when Jeonghyuk refuses the one she offers him, pops them both into her mouth.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYeah,\u201d she mutters around the candy, \u201cFigured it would be messy to keep it from him any longer\u2014might speed up his memory return anyway.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>He wonders what they\u2019re talking about, what could possibly bring his memory back.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou did all you could,\u201d Jeonghyuk says, a hair's breadth softer than normal in the quiet. \u201cEveryone did.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Something in Sooyoung goes lax, and her shoulders loosen.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>They don\u2019t hug, or smile at each other, or act like normal friends (though really, what do any of them know about \u2018normal\u2019)\u2014instead Han Sooyoing bumps shoulders with him and he takes the new lemon candy she offers him. They stand there in silence for a minute, finding something grounding in each other.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>They hadn\u2019t noticed him in the heat of the argument, so he knocks on the doorframe and pretends he hadn\u2019t been there all along, watching them startle.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIt\u2019s late,\u201d Dokja says, rubbing at his eyes sleepily, as if he\u2019d just gotten out of bed. \u201cLet\u2019s go back to sleep?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Sooyoung flicks him on the forehead on her way out and into the next room, while Jeonghyuk stops and stares at him, gaze searching, before doing the same. Dokja clutched at his forehead, rubbing at the red spot that forms.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>When he gets back into the room he doesn\u2019t clamber back into the bed, instead wordlessly slipping in next to Jonghyuk into the futon. He gets an impassive stare in return, before Jonghyuk decides not to say anything and lies down.

She never says anything about it, but she keeps a close watch on him.</p>\n<p>Jonghyuk and Sooyoung also keep a close watch on him--and they make no secret of it. They hover constantly, and Dokja\u2019s pretty sure they\u2019re not even aware of it, doing it as if it\u2019s second nature. One of them seems to be with him at all times, and if they do leave him it's never for long, as if they\u2019ve worked out a schedule together. He thinks about telling them he isn\u2019t going to break under the weight of <em> Omniscient Reader, </em>but if he\u2019s being honest he likes the hovering, enjoys the feeling of them there. Just in the periphery of his vision, a constant.</p>\n<p>Everything feels so wrong and so right. The puzzle pieces are fitting into place, slowly but surely.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>That does not mean it goes slowly. He has to stop reading more than once and set down the manuscript, overwhelmed. Sooyoung lets him watch her write when he does so, though he never speaks up about it, just dragging him along so he can watch her type or scribble notes. It\u2019s calming.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em> [The constellation \u2018Demon King of Salvation\u2019 is looking at the party.] </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em> The party members heard the message.

Dokja thinks about how he was (is? will be?) one of these constellations, as far away as the ones Gilyoung could name, and thinks he\u2019d much rather be here than lonely in the sky. He can imagine smiling down at Gilyoung from a night sky away.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He pushes the thought down.</p>\n<p>Gilyoung\u2019s voice is wry when he talks about some of the constellations, especially when he gets to one he calls the Secretive Plotter. His mouth twists in a smile when he names The Prisoner of the Golden Headband (and for some reason, Dokja feels pressure on his temples, as if he\u2019s wearing one too.)</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>When he reads about Yoo Sangah stuck in a hospital bed, he breathes deeply, setting the manuscript aside and setting out to find her in the house.</p>\n<p>He sits by her side and listens to her stories, lets her ruffle his hair without making a sound.</p>\n<p>She doesn\u2019t ask if anything is wrong, just lets him soak in her presence.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It comes to a head on a snowy day, the roads icy and everyone scrambling to find sweaters that would fit him.</p>\n<p>He reads a few chapters of the manuscript while curled up in bed, straining his eyes to make out the words in the dim light filtering through the blinds from the street lamps.\u00a0</p>\n<p>And then reads about Secretive Plotter\u2019s pain and thinks, <em> I did that.\u00a0 </em></p>\n<p>He hadn\u2019t quite realized what it had meant when Sooyoung had said he\u2019d given Jonghyuk his thousand lives. He didn\u2019t think it ended up quite like this.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He takes one look at Jonghyuk that morning and runs to the bathroom to empty his stomach. Nothing comes up but bile, but he washes his face anyway, letting the water drain down the sink.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a light knock on the door.</p>\n<p>\u201cDokja-ah, are you alright?\u201d</p>\n<p>It\u2019s Huiwon, her voice shaking despite her clear attempt to sound controlled.</p>\n<p>He stands up on shaky legs, leaning against the door silently.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Is he alright?</p>\n<p>Based on the way it's getting harder to breathe and his eyes can\u2019t seem to focus on his reflection in the mirror, he doesn\u2019t think so.</p>\n<p>\u201cDokja-ah, would you mind opening the door?\u201d Huiwon\u2019s composure seems to be fraying, even as she tries to keep it out of her voice.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He should open the door. He really, <em> really </em>should open the door.</p>\n<p>The doorknob almost doesn\u2019t turn because of his clammy palms, but thankfully it does eventually twist open to reveal a rather stressed-looking Huiwon.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThere you are,\u201d she says, sounding relieved. \u201cEat something funny last night?\u201d</p>\n<p>His throat closes up when he tries to answer her, and her brows furrow. She puts a hand on his shoulder and bends down a slight bit so their faces are level.</p>\n<p>\u201cDokja.\u201d</p>\n<p>His breath shudders when it comes out, and he ducks out from under her grasp and makes it out the door, only to bump right into Jonghyuk. He immediately averts his eyes. He won\u2019t--can\u2019t--look at him right now.</p>\n<p>Huiwon trails after them, looking confused when Dokja ducks past Jonghyuk as well. Jonghyuk stops her from following him, shaking his head. Huiwon opens her mouth as if to say something, before reconsidering and nodding, staying with Jonghyuk in the hallway as Dokja continues on until he reaches Shin Yoosoung and they work on math problems for an hour.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He feels hollow by the time lunch rolls around, like ice is crawling through his veins. Yoosoung\u2019s eyes linger on him, and she suggests a break, to which he readily agrees. He hasn\u2019t solved a single equation in the past fifteen minutes, instead feeling his heartbeat rise and slow.\u00a0</p>\n<p>His fears have shifted--he\u2019s still rereading Secretive Plotter\u2019s anguish over and over again in his mind, but now he\u2019s afraid of something else.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s afraid of coming back wrong, of coming back twisted, of coming back and being <em> unwanted. </em>There\u2019s a sinking feeling he has that this is all a dream, and he\u2019s going to wake up to his mother in prison. Distantly, he wonders if he\u2019s already dead, or dying, and this is some sort of fever dream.</p>\n<p>Jihye notices him spacing out at the table and lightly punches him on the shoulder.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat are you thinking about so deeply?\u201d she asks, chuckling. \u201cHeaven knows you have two brain cells. Maybe three at most.\u201d</p>\n<p>He can\u2019t bring himself to laugh with her. She bends down like Huiwon had (it\u2019s remarkable how their quirks have rubbed off on one another) and frowns when she catches sight of his face.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey, I didn\u2019t mean that. Well. I mostly didn\u2019t mean that. C\u2019mon kiddo, I know you\u2019ve got tougher skin than this.\u201d</p>\n<p>He can\u2019t find his voice to explain anything, and he\u2019s pretty sure that if he tells her that he thinks she\u2019s a figment of his imagination that she\u2019ll cry.</p>\n<p>Jihye looks even more concerned now, brushing his fringe out of his face in a surprisingly gentle gesture for her. Her face goes still, and she uses her thumb to quietly rub a tear from his face. He hadn\u2019t even realized he was crying.</p>\n<p>\u201cDokja,\u201d she says softly. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p>\n<p>As if a redo of the morning, he ducks past Jihye and finds himself running, to the sound of her panicked yelling.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He didn\u2019t grab his shoes or a coat, but he can barely feel the cold as he runs. A tree branch catches him in the face and it stings. He thinks it might have left a cut, but it barely even registers as he lets his feet wander.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jonghyuk finds him shivering at the park, clutching at his sleeves while curled up into a ball, trying to preserve what little body heat he had left. He looks so angry, so angry. Kim Dokja knows it\u2019s because he\u2019s worried and that Jonghyuk would rather use his sword on himself before harming Kim Dokja\u2014but that fact gets lost on the way to his brain and he flinches under the wrathful gaze.</p>\n<p>Junghyuk looks even angrier after Dokja jerks away from him, but still makes a clear show of holding up his hands in an almost mock gesture of surrender, slowly kneeling down so that they\u2019re eye level, almost. Dokja continues to shiver, the cold wood of the bench sapping away what warmth he had managed to conserve. Jonghyuk reaches out and grabs his hands, encasing them within his own to try and warm them back up again.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Dokja whispers, afraid to break the still silence.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jonghyuk says nothing, just moves from his kneeling position and onto the bench, still cradling Dokja\u2019s slowly warming palms in his own.</p>\n<p>The silence continues.</p>\n<p>Jonghyuk sits there, considering, before finally speaking.</p>\n<p>\u201cTalk.\u201d</p>\n<p>It\u2019s so curt and abrupt and <em> Yoo Junghyuk </em>that Dokja has to laugh softly.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to have to be a little more specific than that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cExplain, then. Why did you run?\u201d</p>\n<p>Dokja slowly removes his hands from Jonghyuk\u2019s and pulls up his knees, curling inwards, resting his chin on his kneecaps.</p>\n<p>\u201cWas it the book?\u201d Jonghyuk continues, seemingly unperturbed by his continuing silence.</p>\n<p>A bird lands on a tree branch, causing it to sway and drop snow onto the ground. The falling flakes hover in the wind for a moment, before disappearing into the vast blanket of white covering everything.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s never so simple with you, is it,\u201d Jonghyuk sighs, though not in annoyance and more in understanding.</p>\n<p>No, it never really is.</p>\n<p>Another couple of minutes pass, neither of them speaking, until Jonghyuk shifts his weight and summons the Midday Tryst and sends a message.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s hard to read, letters fading and blinking\u2014the power of the scenarios is down to a remaining few drops, artifacts no longer working or if they did, barely functioning.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>[L\u0338\u035d\u034b\u033f\u032a\u032f\u0322\u0354i\u0337\u034b\u0300\u0314\u0301\u0356\u0318f\u0336\u0312\u032b\u031ee\u0335\u0314\u0315\u0351\u030c\u0325 \u0337\u0310\u0342\u0355\u035a\u0325\u0330a\u0337\u0342\u033d\u030b\u0319n\u0335\u030b\u035b\u0328\u0319\u033bd\u0336\u0342\u031b\u034b\u030b\u0322\u031f \u0335\u0352\u0314\u035d\u0302\u031b\u0322D\u0336\u030c\u034c\u0324\u0322\u0333\u0356\u0331e\u0335\u034b\u0348\u0330\u033ba\u0338\u0307\u0312\u0301\u033c\u0345\u0323t\u0338\u0352\u035d\u0307\u0313\u0352\u0355h\u0336\u035d\u031d\u0318\u0330\u0348\u0332 \u0335\u0305\u034c\u0357\u0306\u0312\u031c\u035c\u0349\u031e\u0356C\u0337\u0304\u030c\u0313\u0324\u0326o\u0337\u0360\u0360\u031a\u033a\u0332m\u0334\u030f\u0301\u030e\u0318\u0322\u0347p\u0338\u030f\u0323\u034d\u031da\u0335\u0358\u0346\u0355\u031e\u032bn\u0336\u0352\u030d\u0357\u0319\u032a\u032b\u035a\u0349i\u0334\u030d\u032a\u0322\u0332\u0324o\u0337\u0352\u031a\u032e\u0321n\u0336\u0360\u0303\u0312\u033b\u035a\u035c\u0354s\u0337\u0311\u0312\u0344\u033a\u0329\u0329\u0322\u0328]</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Dokja\u2019s eyes widen, and his gaze snaps to Jonghyuk\u2019s face.</p>\n<p>\u201cIf you aren\u2019t willing to tell me anything, who will you talk to, Dokja?

He\u2019s been reading on the balcony, even though the wind is chilly beyond belief--his fingers went numb from the cold a while ago.</p>\n<p>When he finds Sooyoung, she\u2019s at the stove, snarking at Jihye\u2019s cooking skills while Jihye herself watches, but they both turn to him with big grins when they hear his footsteps.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He feels bad--he\u2019s about to ruin the mood.</p>\n<p>\u201cDo I look like him?\u201d he asks, slow and uncertain. \u201cThe Most Ancient Dream?\u201d</p>\n<p>He thinks that\u2019s why Jonghyuk may have avoided him in the beginning. He thinks that\u2019s why Sangah and Hyungsung didn\u2019t want to let go of him in the subway car.</p>\n<p>Sooyoung takes in a deep breath. Jihye looks away from where she\u2019s been watching them, leaning on the doorframe.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou do,\u201d Sooyoung says, tilting his face to get a better look at the bandage on his cheek. \u201cBecause you are Kim Dokja. But that does not mean you are one and the same. People grow, and there is no version of you we wouldn\u2019t love.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jihye throws a coat on him and scowls, but bends down to help him with the buttons anyway when his half-frozen fingers refuse to cooperate.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Reader, dreamer. One and the same.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He\u2019s going to finish tonight. He can feel how he\u2019s almost whole again, just the last few cracks needing to be buffed over.</p>\n<p>Dokja finds Jonghyuk and Sooyoung drinking tea at the table in silence. The kitchen is dimly lit\u2014the sun has started going down already.</p>\n<p>He opens his mouth to let them know he\u2019s almost done, but Jonghyuk interrupts him.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re almost done,\u201d he says, voice solid as stone.</p>\n<p>Sooyoung looks up from her tea.</p>\n<p>Dokja nods, smiling slightly.</p>\n<p>Sooyoung puts her cup down and pushes her chair back, standing up with a stretch before walking over to him.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell then,\u201d she says. \u201cI guess it\u2019s goodbye to you. A short goodbye, though. You\u2019ll see us again in your grown-up body.\u201d</p>\n<p>He\u2019s glad she didn\u2019t say \u201creal\u201d body. He\u2019s plenty real here too.</p>\n<p>She pulls him into a hug.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou deserved better,\u201d she says. \u201cBut we are here now. And we are not leaving.\u201d</p>\n<p>He hugs her back, and it feels less like a goodbye and more like a \u2018see you later.\u2019</p>\n<p>Jonghyuk pats him on the head\u2014a tad harshly, as if he\u2019s not used to his strength\u2014but Dokja smiles at it anyway.</p>\n<p>The two of them (author and protagonist, author and protagonist, his mind whispers) start the process of getting everybody shuffling towards their beds. He\u2019s relieved that they have the foresight to do so\u2014he doesn\u2019t want an audience when he finally finishes the story.</p>\n<p>When he reaches the last chapter, he hugs Gilyoung and Yoosoung goodnight and waits until they (along with almost everyone else) are asleep, before heading to the living room.</p>\n<p>\u201cGoodnight, Dokja,\u201d Sooyoung whispers, the last one awake, before closing the door. \u201cSee you on the other side.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGood night, Sooyoung noona,\u201d he says, and then, \u201cThank you.\u201d For everything. She smiles and leaves, and he\u2019s alone.</p>\n<p>He flips to the last few pages and stares.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He\u2019s almost caught up.</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>(Dokja the <em> reader, </em>doing what he was always meant to do.)</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>And he finishes the book. Every last chapter.</p>\n<p>He rereads the last sentence.</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em> \u201cThis story is just for that one reader.\u201d </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>He loves Han Sooyoung so, so much. He loves all of them so much.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He almost gets up to go find her, to yell at her for all her sacrifices (hypocritical, he knows) but finds he can\u2019t find the energy to rise to his feet.</p>\n<p>He feels tired, and he can\u2019t quite keep his head up anymore. He manages to summon just enough energy to place the manuscript on the coffee table before the wave of fatigue overtakes him and he slumps over on the couch.</p>\n<p>At some point during his impromptu nap, he feels himself being picked up and gathered in someone\u2019s arms and they carry him a short distance before depositing him in an actual bed. He curls into it, and whoever it is chuckles and passes a hand through his hair before withdrawing. They seem to be talking to someone. With herculean effort, he pries his eyes open a bit.</p>\n<p>He thinks he catches a glimpse of a small group of people. When he opens his eyes a sliver more, they seem to shine in the dim lighting of the room. He lingers on one of them in particular, who seems to have a tail and a golden circlet. They watch him for a moment, the strange people, then start to fade as they leave.</p>\n<p>Dokja tries to keep his eyes open to watch them, but the overwhelming exhaustion proves to be too much, and his eyes start to slide closed again.</p>\n<p>He hears the door click shut, and then nothing more.</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>In the morning, <em> Kim Dokja </em> wakes up.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The light filtering in through the blinds wakes him up, and he groans.\u00a0</p>\n<p>When he sits up, he discovers that his body is suddenly much larger and that overnight the seams of the pajamas he\u2019d been wearing had split. He makes a note to apologize to Gilyoung later, before abruptly realizing that he\u2019s back in his real body, with every memory intact.</p>\n<p>Sooyoung\u2019s manuscript had really worked.</p>\n<p>The memories of being that scared child are vague in his mind, the way he imagines the memories of being thirty were vague for his child-self. He can\u2019t remember anything in much detail, except the overwhelming <em> love </em>he\u2019d felt for his family.</p>\n<p>He sits up, trying to figure out what to do with the ruined pajamas and the fact that he\u2019s nearly naked, when Jihye comes barreling into the room, throwing open the door.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to be late for breakfast, you shrimp,\u201d she\u2019s yelling, \u201cand how do you expect to grow taller without eating proper\u2014\u201c</p>\n<p>She cuts herself off with a surprised scream.</p>\n<p>\u201cDokja-ssi,\u201d she gasps, once she processes what she\u2019s looking at. And then to Dokja\u2019s surprise, she bursts into tears and throws herself at him.</p>\n<p>He manages to catch her in his arms, where she grips him with enough strength that he thinks he might bruise. She\u2019s full-on sobbing, and he holds her tightly, rubbing a hand in circles on her back as she hiccups.</p>\n<p>Eventually the rest of his family piles into the room, drawn by Jihye\u2019s yelling in a panic, and they all stare once they realize what they\u2019re looking at.</p>\n<p>Hyungsung and Huiwon let out twins sighs of relief, while Jonghyuk raises an eyebrow and then leans on the doorframe to watch them all.</p>\n<p>Sooyoung laughs when she sees him, as he frantically tries to cover his exposed skin with a blanket while simultaneously trying not to dislodge Jihye.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Biyoo transforms with a faint <em> pop </em> and places herself on the crook of his neck with a faint <em> cheep </em>noise.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Yoosoung and Gilyoung follow Jihye\u2019s lead and fail at holding back tears, though they tried valiantly to hold them in. They clamber on to him as well, like he\u2019s a piece of playground equipment. An incredibly naked piece of playground equipment.</p>\n<p>He sighs, but hugs them back all the same.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Huiwon takes the remains of Gilyoung\u2019s pajamas and brings him some of his own clothes\u2014a sweater that Sangah had knitted for his birthday one year, and some sweatpants Hyungsung had bought that turned out to be too small for him.</p>\n<p>He changes into them after Sangah gets everyone out of the room, and then joins the rest of the family for breakfast at the table.</p>\n<p>Hyungsung keeps passing him food as if on autopilot, and Dokja doesn\u2019t say anything about it.</p>\n<p>Jonghyuk\u2019s made pancakes for breakfast, soft and fluffy, just the way Dokja likes them.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He really isn\u2019t subtle, is he?</p>\n<p>After breakfast a couple of friends pop by\u2014Jang Hayoung pouts when she realizes she\u2019s no longer taller than him, Myungoh looks quietly relieved but also terrified of Sangah, and Gong Pildu slaps him on the back and tells him he\u2019s still too skinny.</p>\n<p>Aileen and Seolhwa both come by and poke at him until they determine that he\u2019s healthy and there are no lingering after-effects. Aileen gives him a particularly intense glare and insists he tell them if anything feels even <em> slightly </em>off. He nods yes, because he\u2019s terrified of her.</p>\n<p>(His mother comes by, once, and she holds him with trembling hands. She sits at the table with him, and Sangah hovers in the background after bringing them both tea. They talk, really <em> talk </em>for the first time in a while.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It doesn\u2019t hurt.)</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Nobody talks about the younger him, and the past that he doesn\u2019t want to think about (standing on rooftops waiting for it to all end, wishing he was dead), and instead they all occupy his space like they\u2019re afraid to leave him alone for more than a couple seconds at a time.</p>\n<p>Again, all he can feel is the all encompassing love. His younger self had realized just how much they love him, too.</p>\n<p>He thinks that whatever part of him that once became <em> The Most Ancient Dream </em> is finally, finally at rest.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Sangah, his first companion, his first friend\u2014she catches him alone and shoos the rest of them out of the room, telling them she needs a minute with Dokja. They grumble, but acquise and leave.</p>\n<p>Sangah sits him down and asks gently, \u201cYou\u2019re happy here, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p>\n<p>Dokja blinks, surprised by the question. Of course it would be Sangah who asked. She knows how to read him better than anyone else.</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course,\u201d he says, smiling. He wouldn\u2019t trade this epilogue for the world.</p>\n<p>She smiles back, bright as the sun.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>At night, as they get ready for bed, he grins down at Sooyoung.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m taller than you again,\u201d he smirks, just to watch her temper flare.</p>\n<p>She punches him in the shoulder, then sighs.</p>\n<p>\u201cI already miss the younger you. He was so polite.\u201d</p>\n<p>He rolls his eyes at her, and then to his alarm she bursts into tears for what must be the third time these past few weeks and throws her arms around him. She\u2019s clutching at the fabric of his jacket so hard he thinks it might rip apart at the seams.</p>\n<p>\u201cJust fucking stay this time,\u201d she hisses, \u201cstay here and in one piece. I can\u2019t take much more of this.\u201d</p>\n<p>He hugs her back just as tightly. (There\u2019s a lot of people holding on to him for dear life today, aren\u2019t there?)</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not planning on going anywhere,\u201d he says, pulling her close. \u201cNot ever.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jonghyuk is laying on their shared futon already when he gets there, taking up most of the space.</p>\n<p>\u201cJonghyuk-ah,\u201d he says, almost petulantly.</p>\n<p>Jonghyuk rolls his eyes but shifts so there\u2019s enough space for the two of them, and Dokja lies down. Jonghyuk immediately moves into his space.</p>\n<p>\u201cHow was it,\u201d Dokja asks, \u201cmeeting the younger me?\u201d</p>\n<p>Jonghyuk states up at the ceiling.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDifficult,\u201d he says. \u201cLike most things are with you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Dokja knows well enough by now that the regressor means it fondly.</p>\n<p>\u201cI hope I didn\u2019t cause much trouble,\u201d he starts, unsure of what to say.</p>\n<p>Jonghyuk sighs. \u201cYou worry too damn much. It was no trouble. It\u2019s never any trouble with you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Dokja whispers, shifting under the covers. \u201cOkay. Thank you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jonghyuk holds him close, like he\u2019s afraid he\u2019ll disappear again, and he melts into the embrace, feeling the familiar fingers ghosting over his neck.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jonghyuk pulls back a little after a minute, and runs his thumb over Dokja\u2019s cheekbone before kissing him, almost desperately.\u00a0</p>\n<p>They fall asleep together, dreaming of an endless tomorrow.</p>"
