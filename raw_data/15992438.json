Steve tuts at him, looking up from the newspaper and swatting at his legs.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHe doesn't.\u201d Black Widow says. On second thought, \u201cdoes he?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHe doesn't.\u201d The new voice is dry, unamused. All the heads turn to Tony. </span>\n<span>He's standing at the other entrance, carrying a stack of steaming pizza boxes with a tray of Starbuck cups balanced on top</span>\n<span>. Tony sets down the towering stack of pizza boxes on the table. \u201cNo! </span>\n<span>Honestly</span>\n<span>, I leave for five minutes to get the pizza and you think I\u2019ve got a child?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cTo be fair, this random kid </span>\n<span>just</span>\n<span> shows up, asking for homework help, what were we supposed to think?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cDon\u2019t you think you would\u2019ve noticed if I had a kid around the last sixteen years?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIt would be the first thing you\u2019ve kept from us..\u201d Natasha says, slurping her steaming coffee.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Tony crossed his arms. \u201cYeah? What?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cUltron, for one.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThat was-\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Interrupting the budding argument, I ask: \u201cHey, can I have some coffee?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Tony and Natasha look up, her eyeing me </span>\n<span>dubiously</span>\n<span>. \u201cNo.\u201d Tony refuses.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhy not?\u201d I whine.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cBecause it\u2019s bad for you.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou drink it all the time!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI don\u2019t have a developing brain.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cBut-\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNo.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cPlease-\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Mr. Stark raises an eyebrow at me. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>I fall silent, grumbling, \u201cfine.\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Mr. Stark turns away, reaching to grab a slice of pizza. This is my chance. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>In a sudden flurry of motion I vault over the granite countertop, grabbing Mr. Stark's steaming black coffee and dashing into the lounge</span>\n<span>.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHey! Peter!\u201d comes Mr. Stark's outraged voice, I laugh, taking a long chug of his drink.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>It\u2019s hot coffee.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Like </span>\n<span>really</span>\n<span> hot.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>I gasp, spluttering coffee over the carpet. \u201cOw! I burnt my tongue,\u201d I mumble </span>\n<span>thickly</span>\n<span>, sticking the offending organ out.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cServes you right,\u201d comes a cool voice from the door.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cMrrr Stttaaarrrkkk,\u201d I gripe.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cFine. Come in, and drink some ice-water.\u201d he relents.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>I wander back into the kitchen, where the Avengers seem to be in a deep debate.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cSeriously, did Tony just pick him up, or just find out about him...?\u201d Steve wonders.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Clint: \u201cHe did have a few wild years,\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Sam: \"How long ago was that? How old is the kid anyway?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Steve: \u201c16.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Natasha, with a thoughtful look back and a click of her tongue: \u201cEh, possible.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Bucky, throwing a look at Steve: \u201cHe already said it\u2019s not his kid.\"</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Natasha, snorting: \u201csure he isn\u2019t. Have you seen the way they look at each other?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Clint: \u201cDefinitely some father/son bonding there.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\"Jesus! Again!\u201d Tony interrupts, throwing up his hands.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u2018You can\u2019t </span>\n<span>just</span>\n<span> spring this shit on us!\u201d Sam protests.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cSure I can. He's. Not. My. Biological. Child. Can you get that though your heads?\u201d he spells out.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Ms. Romanoff looks down into her coffee and whispers, </span>\n<em>\n<span>\u201cbiological.\u201d</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Tony ignores the comment, filling up a glass of water and dropping a few ice cubes in. They clink against the sides of the glass </span>\n<span>intermittently</span>\n<span>.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThanks, Mr. Stark.\u201d I take the glass.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>After some more whispered arguing, Bucky bites the bullet. \u201cWho is this kid?\u201d he \u00a0crosses his arms, one of them shiny and silver. Okay, I need to ask about that.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Mr. Stark takes a deep breath, \u201cGuys, meet Spiderman.\u201d he says </span>\n<span>heavily</span>\n<span>, I wave a little, sipping Mr. Stark\u2019s coffee. Then wincing, yeah, not the best thing to do with a burnt tongue.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHe\u2019s Spiderman?\u201d Steve (aka CAPTAIN, FREAKING, AMERICA) says </span>\n<span>incredulously</span>\n<span>.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Tony nods, \u201cthat's what I said.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Sam squawks, \u201cHe\u2019s </span>\n<span>just</span>\n<span> a kid!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHey!\u201d I inject.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Tony spares a glance at me, \u201cI know, I know\u2014\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Steve cuts Tony off. \u201cYou brought him to a war-zone! We could have killed him!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cTony, he\u2019s not even </span>\n<span>legally</span>\n<span> an adult!\u201d Clint mouths.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Natasha and Bucky stay in stony silence.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhat on earth were you thinking!\u201d Steve yells. That's the final string.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI WASN\u2019T!\u201d Tony roars, he took a few, short, deep pant-like breaths. \u201cI wasn\u2019t thinking,\u201d he continues, </span>\n<span>slightly</span>\n<span> quieter, calmer now. </span>\n<span>\u201cI wasn\u2019t thinking, I know he\u2019s a kid, and </span>\n<span>probably</span>\n<span> got too much on his plate anyway, and it </span>\n<span>really</span>\n<span> isn't fair and he shouldn't even have powers and the fact I </span>\n<span>took advantage of</span>\n<span> him to fight our war is despicable\u2014\u201d The rest of his voice blurs out before it gets to my ears</span>\n<span>.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>That\u2019s it, I can\u2019t handle it anymore. Spiderman was my choice. Sure, </span>\n<span>maybe</span>\n<span> Mr. Stark shouldn\u2019t have taken me to Berlin, but I would have gotten into equal amounts of trouble here. I </span>\n<em>\n<span>did </span>\n</em>\n<span>get into a equal amount of trouble here. The Vulture dropped a building on me for god\u2019s sake!</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>I kick off my shoes, stripping off my socks. My feet are cold on the tiles. I slam down my glass, making the water splash over the sides. Tony turns and attention </span>\n<span>is diverted</span>\n<span> to me. Spinning on my heel, I take off towards the wall, bare feet finding the edge between the tiles and paint </span>\n<span>easily</span>\n<span>. And then I\u2019m vertical, climbing the wall with ease and speed. I clamber across the ceiling, opening the already unscrewed vent and disappearing inside.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\"Peter!\" Mr. Stark calls after me and then everything is quiet.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The cool air of the vents greets me. I shuffle forward on my hands and knees, the grille swinging open behind me.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>I like the vents. They're cool and silent and lonely. Someplace to think. Sometimes it\u2019s a tight squeeze, but I deal with it. The tunnels run all around the tower. Sometime </span>\n<span>I wonder</span>\n<span> if they </span>\n<span>were made</span>\n<span> so large on purpose, or if it\u2019s only a coincidence.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>I keep shuffling forward, the familiar twist and turns of the maze before me. I'm up here a lot. I discovered the network when playing hide-and-seek, </span>\n<span>oddly</span>\n<span> enough. It takes a lot of persuading, and Mr. Stark pretty much </span>\n<span>just</span>\n<span> counts to 30 and then got F.R.I.D.A.Y to tell him where I am. But it\u2019s nice that he even pretends.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>I'm </span>\n<span>nearly</span>\n<span> to my room when I hear grunting ahead. Freezing, I shy away from the noise, yet curious to who it is.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cJesus, when...did..these dam vents...get so tight?\u201d Then a muttering of Russian expletives.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>I crawl forward to see a half-in, half-out Natasha Romanoff. bn her head bobs </span>\n<span>oddly</span>\n<span> as she struggles through the vents.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d I ask.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201c\u0411\u043b\u044f\u0434\u044c!\u201d She shrieks. Her foot kicks back and I can hear the chair she\u2019s balancing on clang to the floor.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d I ask, concerned.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYeah. I wanted to see if you were alright,\u201d she pants, pulling herself up. I reach out a hand, helping her.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhy?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou\u2019re </span>\n<span>just</span>\n<span> a kid.\u201d she shrugs. She tries to compose herself, huffing a clump of hair out of her face. \u201cAnd I do have a maternal side, no matter how much I hide it.\u201d she rolls her eyes, easing of of the sudden awkwardness away. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>I blush </span>\n<span>darkly</span>\n<span>, \u201cI\u2019m not a kid!\u201d I repeat.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>She raises her eyebrows </span>\n<span>seriously</span>\n<span>, \u201cYou kinda are.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>I growl. \u201cFine. But no more, it\u2019s bad enough Mr. Stark calls me Underoos.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Natasha\u2019s eyebrows raise up to her hairline, \u201che calls you Underoos?\u201d she repeats, crazy grin spreading over her face.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNo..\u201d I mumble, blushing again.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHe does!

No anything.\u201d He finishes finally.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhy would I pick him up from school?\u201d she inquires, sounding confused. \u201cOr any of that actually.\u201d she adds, as if a second thought.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Tony raises his eyebrows, \u201cThat\u2019s what I thought, the kid grows on you.\u201d From my vantage point I see Natasha lift her head ever so </span>\n<span>slightly</span>\n<span>, eyes flicking to the vents above where I\u2019m hiding.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYeah. I can see that.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Tony moves to leave, opening the door and half-stepping out. \u00a0Before he does, he calls out: \u201cI know you\u2019re up there, Peter.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>There\u2019s a moment of silence, then I stick my head out of the vent, grinning in both a mischievous and apologetic way. \u201cSorry, Mr. Stark,\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>His eyes </span>\n<span>are masked</span>\n<span> behind iconic yellow ray-bans. \u201cNo problem, kid.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHey, Hap!\u201d I call out at Happy Hogan\u2019s half-visible face though the window, Happy cocks a hand in a wave. I say goodbye to Ned, walking towards the shiny black Audi.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>I pull open the backseat door, sliding in without a look inside. Turning my head, I am met with a surprise. There, sitting with a\u00a0slightlyawkward look on his face is Steve Rodgers.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?!\u201d I gush, eyes wide and starry at one of my heros, (still got a place in my heart, Iron-Man.)</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Happy sighs from the front seat, \u201cSorry, kid, he made me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, no! This is like a dream!\u201d I fanboy, \u201cohmygod ohmygod ohmygod!\u201d I squeal, each \u2018ohmygod\u2019 rising in pitch. \u201cWhat was it like in the ice? What was it like in the war? What was it like waking up? Ohmygod, what was it like watching TV for the first time??\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Mr. Rogers sighs,\u00a0obviously\u00a0used to this sort of attention but still\u00a0slightly\u00a0amused. \u201cTony seems to like you, so-\"</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>I cut him off. \"You think?\" I ask\u00a0shyly\u00a0.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"I know,\" Mr. Rodgers reaffirms. \"it's\u00a0honestly\u00a0disturbing, I've never seen the man so\u00a0motherly\u00a0.\"</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Anyway,\" he resumes, \"I wanted to meet you without Tony peering over my shoulder and threatening to castrate me if I mentally damage you\u00a0.\"</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou mean his rules?\u201d I click in my seatbelt with a snap and Happy pulls away from the curve.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHow do you know about that?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>I blush, \u201cI\u00a0totally\u00a0wasn\u2019t hiding in the vents when he told Ms. Romanoff. She\u2019s nice by the way.\u201d I decline to mention the fact I got caught.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He raises his blonde eyebrows, \u201cnice?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Pink rises to my cheeks again, \u201cYeah. She found me in the vents after I uh...ran off yesterday.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHuh,\u201d He says, \u201cshe must like you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI like her too.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cShe\u2019s a good friend.\u201d A moment of long, stretched out silence passes. Mr. Rogers clears the quiet with another question, \u201cSo, Spider-Man, huh?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>I chuckle, looking down in embarrassment, \u201cYep. I uh\u2026 started swingin\u2019 around Queens and then Mr. Stark found me off YouTube, do you know what YouTube is? Well anyway he made me a new suit, helped me with my web serum.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cTony didn\u2019t\u2026\u201d He searches for the right word, \u201c...make you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>I splutter, \u201cum, if you\u2019re asking if he\u2019s my dad, he\u2019s not.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, no, I gathered that from yesterday. I meant, did he give you powers and make you into Spider-Man?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNo. I did that all my myself.\u201d I say\u00a0proudly\u00a0, puffing out my chest besides myself. Steve sees and smirks.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHow\u2019d you get your powers?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cRadioactive spider bit me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat can you do?\u201d Steve asks, sounding\u00a0genuinely\u00a0interested.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI can climb walls and ceilings, and I have super strength, which I guess you figured, dropping an airport ramp on me and all\u00a0.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Steve winces, \u201cSorry about that, by the way.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s cool. We\u2019re even, I took your shield.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Steve laughs, \u201cReal underdog, huh? You remind me of someone I used to know.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah? Who?\u201d I ask\u00a0excitedly\u00a0.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cA kid from Brooklyn in the forties. Real scrappy, would stand up to anyone, even though he was tiny.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>I beam with pride, my phone buzzes in my pocket. I check the screen, it\u2019s Ned:</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em>Sorry about Flash today. He\u2019s a dick, don\u2019t worry about it</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>I go to tuck my phone away, intending to reply later.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWho\u2019s Flash?\u201d Steve asks, a determination in his eyes.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cUh, no one.\u00a0Just\u00a0a kid at school.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHe giving you trouble?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, no -\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t lie to me, Peter.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>I sigh in defeat. \u201cFine.

Anything else?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>I sigh again, \u201che makes fun of my parents. You know, how they\u2019re dead. Also, he doesn't believe me about Mr. Stark and my internship,\u00a0just\u00a0teases me, you know? Asks if I\u2019ve met any Avengers yet, that kinda thing.\u00a0Honestly\u00a0it's not a big deal.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDoes Tony know about this?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell Mr. Stark!\u201d I bolt out, turning towards the Captain, \u201che can\u2019t know!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d he says suspiciously.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIf he finds out he\u2019ll rip Flash\u2019s head off, and I do not need that publicity, and neither does he. I\u00a0just\u00a0know he\u2019ll over-react and walk into school with a marching band, and promise to ruin his life, or something.\u201d I sigh, slumping back in the seat, exhausted.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"What would get him off your back?\" Steve asks, looking thoughtful.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"I dunno.\"</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWould Captain America picking you up do the trick?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>XxXxXxXxXx</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>I jump down the stairs two at a time, typing in the code to Tony Stark's workshop.

I get that.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cSo you see? I can\u2019t take a break.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cKid,\u201d Clint looked me in the eyes, \u201ceveryone can take a break.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>I sigh, \u201cI guess. It\u2019s </span>\n<span>just</span>\n<span> a lot of pressure, you know?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI know. But no-one is pressuring you, or expecting you to save the world in recess, okay?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYeah. But like Mr. Stark made me this whole new suit and flew me out to Germany. And then when my Aunt May was late on rent he paid it and I only know that because of my enhanced hearing. </span>\n<span>I </span>\n<span>just</span>\n<span> feel like he\u2019s helped me so much and I need to repay him, somehow,\u201d I suck in a shuddering breath, tears prickling at the corners of my eyes</span>\n<span>.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Clint walks around the bench, discarding his half-eaten pop-tart next to mine. \u201cKilling yourself isn\u2019t repaying him. Tony\u2026\u201d Clint looks unsure on how to proceed. </span>\n<span>\u201cI've never seen Tony so </span>\n<span>ridiculously</span>\n<span> happy than when he\u2019s around you,\u201d Clint smiles, and I see some of his parental-ness showing though</span>\n<span>. \u201cOr Pepper, but that\u2019s beside the point\u201d he adds. </span>\n<span>\u201cThe point is he loves you, and </span>\n<span>I don't think</span>\n<span> you could do anything short of blowing up the entire tower and he\u2019d still forgive you</span>\n<span>. And even then - you could </span>\n<span>probably</span>\n<span> get away with that too.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>I giggle </span>\n<span>wetly</span>\n<span>, a lone tear slipping down my cheek. I wipe it away </span>\n<span>stubbornly</span>\n<span>. Clint pulls me in for a hug, one of those big, warm, bear hugs where you get swallowed up. He smells like </span>\n<span>freshly</span>\n<span> mown grass and cologne.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>We seperate, \u201cThank you, Clint.\u201d I say </span>\n<span>honestly</span>\n<span>.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>He smiles back at me, picking up his poptart again, \u201cdon\u2019t mention it, kiddo.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>I groan, throwing back the covers and getting out of bed. I\u2019m staying the weekend with Mr. Stark at SI, Aunt May is out of town and she insisted. I don\u2019t particularly mind, it means I get to work on cool tech everyday.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It\u2019s been a few weeks since I wandered in on the Avengers. It\u2019s been great ever since, chats with Steve Rogers, Natasha teaching me Russian, movie marathons with Clint. I still can\u2019t believe it.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>I hang out with the Avengers.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em> The Avengers. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>If Flash knew he would piss his pants.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>My geeky bedroom is dark, the only light coming from the the window in silver streams. Mr. Stark kitted it out especially, with a Star Wars duvet, shelves above my bed teeming with lego, and a comfy desk and chair to study on.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The glowing digital clock on my bedside table reads: 4: 21. I pad across the carpet as\u00a0quietly\u00a0as I can, opening the door with only a creak. The rest of the hallway is dark, no-one else is awake - not even Mr. Stark. A heavy, sleepy silence cloaks the tower.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>I wander down the corridor towards the kitchen, the beige carpet soft under my bare feet. I used to get lost, but after the 5th time getting up in the night I manage my way. But still, the dark maze of hallways and rooms are unnerving.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The rest of the Avengers have\u00a0officially\u00a0moved into the tower - which the press is having a field day with - and everyone's settled into a routine. I come around at least three times a week, and have gotten to know everyone pretty well.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>I push open the kitchen door, yawning. Stepping inside, I swing open the fridge door.\u00a0Instantly, a cold metal bar wraps across my throat from behind. I gasp, going stiff in surprise. The yellow light from the fridge illuminates a shiny silver arm - not bar.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>In an automatic move I claw at the metal that\u2019s squeezing at my windpipe, \u201cWho are you?\u201d the rough, unmistakable voice of Bucky Barnes whispers in my ear.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cPe..Peter,\u201d I choke out. The arm around my neck is gone in a instant. I gasp in air, slipping to the cold tiled ground.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSorry, sorry!\u201d\u00a0he says\u00a0frantically, \u201cI didn\u2019t recognise you,\u201d He sounds regretful,\u00a0genuinely, actually sorry.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine, Mr. Winter Soldier Bucky Barnes sir,\u201d I ramble, still catching my breath.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHonestly, Peter, I\u2019m sorry. I\u00a0just\u00a0stepped into uh...HYDRA mode, and I\u00a0just\u00a0didn\u2019t think.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNot your fault,\u201d I stand up.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI..I thought I was getting better,\u201d he mumbles, pushing his hair back from his face.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou are.\u201d I say confidently.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He looks up sharply, \u201chow would you know that?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI can hear through walls. Mr. America was talking to Mr. Stark about your improvement.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cBeen eavesdropping, have you, kid?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNot my fault, I can\u2019t tune it out.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHuh. You\u00a0really\u00a0do have superpowers.\u201d It\u2019s not a question, not a statement either. Somewhere\u00a0in between. He wanders over to the counter, leaning on it\u00a0heavily.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, got bit by a radioactive spider,\" I explain, fiddling with the hem of my T-shirt.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHow\u2019d that happen?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cField trip to Oscorp, I\u2019m not sure when it happened, and the next thing I knew I was throwing up in the school bathroom.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOch.\u201d Bucky winces\u00a0sympathetically.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, it was horrible. The first week after the bite I felt like shit. I would pass out, and puke and I was always cold. But it was worth it, my powers I mean.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDamn. Sounds tough, kid.\u201d I know he\u2019s\u00a0probably\u00a0just\u00a0humouring me, I mean he was in a war for god's sake, but it still strokes my ego.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWant me to\u00a0demonstrate?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He snorts, \u201cof course.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>I step back, clearing a bit of space. Bucky sees what I\u2019m doing and steps back too. I do a backflip, landing on my feet\u00a0perfectly.\u00a0Normally\u00a0that would impress Ned, Aunt May or even Mr. Stark.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThat all? I could do that in my sleep,\u201d Bucky teases.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>I laugh, \u201cI\u2019ll bring out the big guns.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>I step closer to the wall, jumping the switch between horizontal and vertical. \u201cI guess I already demonstrated this, but I don\u2019t want to use my super-strength on Mr. Stark\u2019s stuff.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>I walk up the plaster, hoping I\u2019m not leaving footprints on the paint. In a moment I\u2019m standing upside down on the ceiling.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s pretty cool, kid.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cReally!?\u201d I say incredulously.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, that would have helped us out back in the day.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat were the forties like, Mr. Barnes?\u201d I ask\u00a0eagerly.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He smiles\u00a0mistily, nostalgia thick in his voice when he speaks, \u201cgrowing up was some of the best times of my life. I mean, there were bad things too. The Great Depression hit everyone hard, and I saw people starve, but we leant on each other.\u00a0Don\u2019t even get me started on block fights, but swing music and stuff was\u00a0really\u00a0popular, so me and Steve would go dancing all the time.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI wish I could have lived back then, it would have been so cool!\u201d I say\u00a0excitedly.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWe lived in a queer neighbourhood, and the parties would be\u00a0absolutely\u00a0awesome. I mean, the stuff we got up to,\u201d he whistles, \"I'm pretty sure I'm not allowed to tell you.\"</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you gay?\u201d I know it\u2019s probably insensitive, that even if he is it\u2019s none of my business and if he even wanted to tell me, it would be in his own time.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bucky swallows, \u201cUh, yeah, yeah I am.\u201d he says, eyes meeting mine\u00a0tersely.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cCool. So what\u2019re block fights?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bucky laughs.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy is there footprints on the wall?\u201d Steve walks into the kitchen. I choke on my cornflakes, coughing\u00a0suspiciously. Bucky pats me on the back.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy are you two acting suspicious?\u201d Steve says, eyes narrowed.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cBucky\u2019s gay,\u201d I blurt out, \u201cSorry!\u201d\u00a0I say to Buck, \u201cI was\u00a0just\u00a0thinking about all the stuff you must\u2019ve gone though and what a change that had to have been coming from a homophobic community to an accepting one and\u00a0just\u2026\u201d I falter, giving Bucky a \u2018I\u2019m sorry\u2019 look.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Steve raises an eyebrow, \u201cI know Bucky\u2019s gay.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t that big of a deal,\u201d Bucky says, \u201cI mean, we did live in a gay community, so we weren\u2019t\u00a0<em> that </em>\u00a0exposed to homophobia. But we did know people who lived outside and\u00a0were hated\u00a0on.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSusanna, Joe Gringsworth, Violet Sherbasky,\u201d Steve lists, sipping a mug full of coffee.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cJohnny White,\u201d Bucky adds, raising his eyebrows.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Steve sighs, looking sad, \u201cpoor Johnny.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat happened to Johnny?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSome guys beat him to death with a brick when they found out he was gay.\u201d Steve says\u00a0bluntly.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHoly shit,\u201d I gape, \u201chow is that allowed?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThe police didn\u2019t care,\u201d Bucky explains, \u201cjust\u00a0another queer.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHow the fuck did that go by??\u201d I demand.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cLanguage,\u201d Steve warns, \u201cand it didn\u2019t. Half the community was out for blood. They found one of the pricks that did it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat happened to him?\u201d I ask, eyes wide as saucers.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cTied him up and threw him in the river,\" Bucky explains, picking at his metal arm.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cLike the Hudson?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Steve shrugs, \u201cI don\u2019t remember now.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDid you do it?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Steve hesitates, \u201cI helped.\u201d he says\u00a0stiffly.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHow?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cGot the ropes and stood watch while they threw the bastard in. Johnny was my friend.\u201d he explains, fire boiling in his eyes.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bucky clears his throat, \u201cI think\u00a0that\u2019s enough. We don\u2019t want to mentally scar him, and you remember Tony\u2019s rules.\"</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah. Sorry kid.\u201d Steve apologises, the fire in his eyes simmering down.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNo! It\u2019s so cool! I\u2019m gonna do my report on it!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOn Captain America throwing homophobes in the river? Because I don\u2019t think Pepper, or PR, would be very happy with that,\u201d Bucky smirks.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, on homophobia, focusing on the thirties and forties.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Bucky laughs, sharing a look with Steve, \u201cYou go, kid.\u201d</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\n<span>\u201cUh, hi?\u201d I say.

I doubt world-class assassins </span>\n<span>are trained</span>\n<span> in the art of glad-wrap (it is an art.) I take a cookie, sinking my teeth into the chewy-soft sweet dough.

He looks pissed off and irritated, so I'm guessing he's </span>\n<span>just</span>\n<span> talked to Mr. Stark</span>\n<span>.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Uh, no, I\u2019m not getting into this. I put down my bag, intending to retreat. Of course he sees me.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>He arches an eyebrow, one good eye staring at me. \u201cWho are you?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cUh.. Peter, who are you?\u201d I ask in return.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cDirector Fury,\u201d he greets, not extending a hand.

I have a feeling it's not because what I said was funny. \u201cNo, who are you to Stark and the others?.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWell I dunno...I\u2019m Mr. Stark's intern \u2014\u201d I lie </span>\n<span>frantically</span>\n<span>,</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201c\u2014 yeah, yeah Spider-Man.

Now, back to the main point,\u201d he says, cutting off any replies. \u201cWho are you to the Avengers?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI dunno, I mean, </span>\n<span>I think</span>\n<span> everybody likes me,\u201d I shuffle </span>\n<span>awkwardly</span>\n<span>. \u201cI\u2019m learning Russian from Ms. Romanoff and Bucky and Steve helped me on a paper for school. I got an A+.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cGod, it\u2019s worse than I thought,\u201d he mumbles, rubbing a hand over his eyes...well, eye.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhat is?\u201d I let out a little shriek, jumping, Fury does the event of the same, looking up </span>\n<span>hastily</span>\n<span>.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Natasha is standing behind me, smiling sugar sweet, something sharp and devilish behind her smile, coated in red lipstick.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNow, \u043f\u0430\u0443\u043a, we have to go. Stark\u2019s planning a prank war,\u201d she puts her hands on my shoulders, fingers curling along my collar bone. I know her eyes have not strayed from Fury, and I know any other man would </span>\n<span>be scared</span>\n<span> shitless right now.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Fury is not any other man.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAgent \u2014\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201c\u2014 I\u2019m not sure what crimes or connections this </span>\n<em>\n<span>minor</span>\n</em>\n<span> has to any criminal organization, and I very </span>\n<span>highly</span>\n<span> doubt you are here to recruit him, so, I would recommend leaving before </span>\n<em>\n<span>Stark</span>\n</em>\n<span> comes down you see you preying on a </span>\n<em>\n<span>close confidant</span>\n</em>\n<span> and </span>\n<em>\n<span>child</span>\n</em>\n<em>\n<span>.\u201d</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Fury stares after us </span>\n<span>stonily</span>\n<span>, Natasha marching me out of the kitchen. I whisper a \u2018thanks\u2019 and she only shakes her head, \u201cyou do not have to thank me, \u043f\u0430\u0443\u043a.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Peter bumped into someone while entering the living room, \u201coh, sorry,\u201d h mumbled, not looking up from his homework</span>\n<span>. He has three tests in the next week. </span>\n<em>\n<span>Three</span>\n</em>\n<span>. Even if he's a 'genius' like Mr. Stark keeps telling him, he needs to learn these Spanish vowels.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNo problem,\u201d comes a </span>\n<span>vaguely</span>\n<span> Russian-sounding voice. Peter\u2019s head snaps up, realising it's not an Avenger.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHey, you're that magic girl,\u201d Wanda blinks at him, Vision hovering a few feet behind.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWanda. But yes.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Peter nods, eyes turning to Vision. \u201cWoah, you're like a robot,\u201d he says, staring up at him.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYes.\u201d he says, his impersonal, British voice amused. \u201cAlthough Mr. Stark likes to call me an AI stealer. If not sure how </span>\n<span>I feel</span>\n<span> about the moniker.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Peter laughs, \u201cyeah, he calls me weird things too. </span>\n<span>I think</span>\n<span> he does with everyone.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYes, I have found that,\u201d Vision agrees, his cloak rippling around him.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHe calls you the\u2026.spider, does he not?\u201d Wanda asks, \u201cyou are Peter, correct?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYeah, Peter Parker, nice to meet you,\u201d he sticks out a hand.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>She takes it with a jovial smile, \u201cI\u2019m Wanda Maximoff.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I have business to attend to,\u201d Vision says, \u201cit was nice meeting you, Peter,\u201d he nods </span>\n<span>cordially</span>\n<span> and floats through the wall</span>\n<span>.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201c....That's creepy.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>She raises an eyebrow, \u201cyeah. You get used to it.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cCool. Can you yeet me across the room?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Wanda shrugs, \u201csure.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>She's raising her hands in preparation, red light gathering between her fingers, when Mr. Stark walks into the room</span>\n<span>. He sees Peter\u2019s grinning face and Wanda\u2019s outstretched hands and yells \u201cNo!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>As quick as a blink, the smile </span>\n<span>is wiped</span>\n<span> off Peter\u2019s face and if not for the press coverage, you would have no idea Wanda can control magic</span>\n<span>.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWe weren't doing anything,\u201d Peter says </span>\n<span>innocently</span>\n<span>, clasping his hands behind his back.

Bruce came in behind, also carrying plates. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>They\u2019re having a big team dinner, all crowded onto the newly-extended dining room table, all the Avengers are here, Pepper, Happy, Ant Man, Hope, Cassie, Brunnhilde, Korg, Dr. Strange, Carol, Wanda, Shuri, T\u2019Challa, all the Guardians of the Galaxy, Bucky, Rhodey and Nebula.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThis is really good Mr. Steve,\u201d Peter said earnestly, after his first big bite. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThanks, Peter,\u201d Steve smiled.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cTook a couple hours in the kitchen, but it\u2019s well worth it,\u201d Bruce added on.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI\u2019ll say,\u201d Tony murmured from Peter\u2019s left. \u201cIt\u2019s great, Cap.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIn Asgard, we roast boars over a spit for several hours,\u201d Brunnhilde offers. \u201cThis is not too dissimilar, I find.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIn Louisiana,\u201d Carol says, \u201cwe...\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Peter fazes out of the conversation easily, pushing peas around his plate. He looks up and thinks </span>\n<em>\n<span>family. </span>\n</em>\n<span>Mr. Stark is flicking peas at Clint \u2014 who is throwing them right back \u2014 Natasha is filling Brunnhilde\u2019s glass with vodka, Dr. Strange is spinning magical yellow symbols into the air, and Thor, Korg and Shuri are all in a contest of some sort, run by Pepper, Rhodey looks like he just wants to eat his steak and get rid of Rocket, who is no doubt trying to get him to sell the armour, the rest of the Guardians are arguing, Carol is talking to Bucky about...fight critiques? And Scott and Hope are not-so-subtly making eyes at each other, something that Cassie is miming throwing up about.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhat about you, squirt?\u201d Natasha asks him. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOh\u2026 my Aunt can't cook,\u201d he says. The table roars into laughter, Tony gagging at the memory. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<span>Yeah, </span>\n</em>\n<span>Peter thinks again, </span>\n<em>\n<span>this is family. </span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p><br>\n<br>\n</p>"
