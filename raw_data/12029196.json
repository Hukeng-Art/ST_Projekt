  "summary": "<p>Sometimes a witch or wizards magical signature is so completely incompatible with another that they repel one another like magnets. On the other hand, if two magical signatures mesh well together, well there are no stronger relationships in all the world. In a sample of a thousand people, the average witch or wizard will be slightly repelled by four or five people and strongly repelled by only one, at the most. The opposite is true for attraction.<br>But Harry Potter can't kiss anyone at all.</p>",

  "text": "<p>When\nCho went to kiss Harry sniffling and grieving, her cheeks stained with\ntears, it was if they both hit an invisible wall in the air. A\npressure that grew as they got closer and pushed them away from each\nother. The closest Cho got to him was about three inches then she\npulled back with a shaky laugh.</p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>Figures,\u201d\nshe smiled weakly and reached out a hand to pat his shoulder and then\ndropped it as she stepped back, \u201cSee you around.\u201d</span></span></p>\n<p>\nHarry\nimmediately went and told Ron and Hermione.</p>\n<p>\nRon\ngrimaced, \u201cOooh, tough luck there, mate.\u201d</p>\n<p>\nHarry\nfrowned at him, \u201cWhat do you\u00a0<i>mean</i>?\u201d</p>\n<p>\nHermione\ncocked her head thoughtfully as she set her quill down, \u201cI\u2019ve\nread about this\u2026 Sometimes a witch or wizards magical\nsignature is so completely incompatible with another that they repel\none another like\u2026 magnets. You know how when they\u2019re\nopposite poles the magnets stick together but the same pole repel and\nyou can\u2019t even push them together? It\u2019s like that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>But\nthen, I wouldn\u2019t be able to touch her at all? I\u2019ve\ntouched Cho\u2026 her arm, I\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019ve touched\nher arm,\u201d Harry said in confusion.</span></span></p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>Well,\nthat\u2019s the very interesting thing about it, you see, our magic\nis quite sedate most of the time unless we\u2019re using it to cast\nor when we\u2019re very agitated- that\u2019s where spontaneous\nuncontrolled magic comes from,\u201d Hermione said, spreading her\nhands as she became more engaged in the subject, \u201cand when\nyou\u2019re about to do something like\u2026 kiss someone you\nreally fancy-\u201d\u00a0</span></span></p>\n<p>\nHarry\nflushed.</p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>-your\nheart rate picks up and you get nervous and you magic gets agitated.\nOur bodies are really quite bad at telling the difference between\ngood, excited nervous and more life threatening bad nervous. It only\nreally affects you when you\u2019re really close to someone as well,\nso it\u2019s not really that noticeable a majority of the time.\u201d</span></span></p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>Oh\u2026\u201d\nHarry said blankly.</span></span></p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>Don\u2019t\nworry,\u201d Ron reassured him, \u201cIt\u2019s really rare to be\nthat repelled.\u201d</span></span></p>\n<p>\nHermione\nnodded in agreement, \u201cIt\u2019s like- in a sample size of- of\na\u00a0<i>thousand</i>people, you\u2019ll be slightly repelled from\nfour or five and strongly repelled by only one, at the most.\u201d</p>\n<p>\nRon\nadded, \u201cAnd it\u2019s not all bad. If you find someone you\u2019re\na really good match with it\u2019s like- like\u00a0<i>amazing</i>,\nthe best thing ever. True love and all. My mum and dad are like\nthat.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>I\nwouldn\u2019t worry about it,\u201d Hermione said.</span></span></p>\n<p>\nRon\nnodded, \u201cYeah, there\u2019ll be others.\u201d</p>\n<p>\nHarry\nnodded too, trying not to dwell on what had happened.</p>\n<p><br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>\nWhen\nhe tried to kiss Ginny in the common room, with everyone cheering and\ncelebrating, they got so close he could feel the warmth of her breath\nghost across his lips. It was brief and no one saw that they really\nhadn\u2019t kissed. Ginny tried to hide her confusion and\ndisappointment but Harry could see it all the same. It probably\nlooked quite like his own expression.</p>\n<p>\nThey\ntried again in private later but it was even worse, likely because\nthey were more nervous. Ginny gave him a sad smile and left to be\nalone. He heard that she spent the next couple days in the Ravenclaw\ntower with Luna. Ron was mad at him for breaking his sister\u2019s\nheart and Harry didn\u2019t have it in him to explain what had\nhappened.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\nHe\nfelt like it was his fault and he was entirely certain he had the\nworst luck in the world.</p>\n<p><br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>\nAfter\nthe war was a time for new beginnings. Life could only get better and\nHarry was certain his magical signature being incompatible with\npeople was because of Voldemort\u2019s horcrux being inside him. Or\nperhaps it was a case of not kissing enough people.</p>\n<p>\nWhen\nhe and all his friends went out drinking and having fun that summer\nhe made a point, once he had enough drunken courage, to try and\nkiss\u00a0<i>someone</i>. It didn\u2019t even matter who. He just\nwanted to find someone he didn\u2019t bounce off of like he was\nwearing a fish tank on his head. Each time he tried, it got a little\neasier to try again. Until it got to the point where he\u2019d try\nto kiss everyone in the bar who\u2019d let him.</p>\n<p>\nHe\ngot close a few times, like he had with Ginny, but for most, he would\nfeel the push back before he was even six inches off. Luna kissed his\ncheek once when she caught him off guard, it was a very sweet\nfriendly kiss. Harry couldn\u2019t stop thinking about how the first\nand maybe only time he\u2019d ever felt lips on his skin was from a\nfriend.</p>\n<p>\nHe\nwent back to Hogwarts with Hermione and Ron to finish his schooling,\nfor their \u201ceighth year\u201d. McGonagall was very big on\ninter-house unity. All the teachers would lavishly praise and give\nhouse points to anyone so much pausing to pick up a dropped parchment\nfor a classmate from another house. The effort resulted in much\nembarrassment all around. There was no bullying, but most houses kept\nto themselves. Perhaps, that was why McGonagall allowed all the\neighth and seventh years have a party.</p>\n<p>\nLike\nthe good teenagers they were, there was a great deal of illicit\nalcohol involved and very little self-control.</p>\n<p>\nHarry\nthrew back the last of his fire whisky and thumped the glass down on\nthe table, yelling above the music from the wireless, \u201cI\u2019m\ngonna kiss everyone in this room!\u201d</p>\n<p>\nA\ndrunken cheer greeted his declaration. A girl sitting behind him\nstartled to her feet, her drink spilling over her fingers as she\nstepped closer, \u201cMe first,\u201d she smiled shyly.</p>\n<p>\nShe\nhad been flirting rather desperately with Harry all night and though\nhe wasn\u2019t interested in the slightest he leaned down. She\ntwitched forward eagerly and was just as quickly pushed back quite a\ndistance from Harry. Apparently, she was a particularly bad match.</p>\n<p>\nHe\ndidn\u2019t laugh in her face but it was a near thing. He was just\ndrunk enough that awfulness of his situation was fucking hilarious.</p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>Sorry,\u201d\nHarry grinned and turned to the person sitting beside her and then\nthe next person and the next. One miss after another as the music and\nchatter grew louder and the night wore on. He teased Dean and Seamus\ninto a kiss, Dean almost managed it, close enough Harry could feel\nhis laughter before he pulled away to give Seamus a proper kiss. He\ndid not kiss Ron or Hermione, it would\u2019ve been like kissing a\nsibling and he wasn\u2019t interested in having creepy nightmares\nabout it for the rest of his life. Everyone else he approached\nhumoured him and gave Harry a go at a quick kiss.</span></span></p>\n<p>\nHe\nwas fast running out of people to try- and fail -to kiss when he\nfound himself at the back corner of the room, the large couch pushed\nagainst the wall had been taken over by the only three Slytherin\u2019s\nwho came back to finish up their schooling, Blaise, Pansy and, Draco\nMalfoy. They were relaxed, somewhat sprawled over one another with a\nbottle of fire whisky to pass between them. They weren\u2019t nearly\nas relaxed when they noticed Harry staring at them, the lot of them\nstiffening like a group of alley cats arching their backs and\nhissing.</p>\n<p>\u201c<i><span>What</span></i><span><span>?\u201d\nPansy lifted her nose with a sniff, \u201cWe\u2019ve a right to be\nhere, same as you.\u201d</span></span></p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>You\nneed something, Potter?\u201d Blaise asked.</span></span></p>\n<p>\nHarry\nblinked, \u201cA kiss,\u201d he said. Once upon a time, the\nprospect of kissing a trio of Slytherins would have been far too\nnerve-wracking but not anymore. The thing about trying to kiss about\na hundred odd people was that the whole procedure rather lost its\nmagic, so to speak.</p>\n<p>\nThey all stared at him blankly.</p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>I\ndid say I was going to kiss everyone in the room,\u201d Harry made a\nshow of looking around, \u201cYou\u2019re here.\u201d</span></span></p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>You\u2019ve\u00a0</span></span><i><span>got</span></i><span><span>\u00a0to\nbe kidding,\u201d Pansy said, raising an eyebrow in disbelief.</span></span></p>\n<p>\nBlaise\nlaughed, \u00a0pushing himself to his feet and out of the tangle of\nhis friend\u2019s legs without somehow tripping himself up, \u201cMe\nfirst, Boy-wonder,\u201d Blaise said with the smug challenging sort\nof look that seemed to be calling out Harry\u2019s bluff.</p>\n<p>\nHarry\nreturned the look, \u201cGet on with it then.\u201d</p>\n<p>\nA flicker of hesitation crossed Blaise\u2019s face before he managed\nto mask it, crossing the distance between them.</p>\n<p>\nHarry\ntried to stay calm. The whole kissing thing seemed to work out better\nif he could but it was pointless since Blaise hardly had a go at all.\nAs soon as the nudging pressure began to make itself known he backed\noff with a smirk.</p>\n<p>\nBlaise\ndropped back onto the couch with a thud, \u201cWell, that was\nanticlimactic.\u201d</p>\n<p>\nPansy\nlooked from Harry to Blaise curiously and then popped up, approaching\nHarry with a tilt to her head that brought to Harry\u2019s mind the\nalley cat image again. She went up on tiptoes and Harry leaned down\nas she tried to kiss the corner of his mouth. Harry was a little\nsurprised how close she got, about a half an inch away.</p>\n<p>\nHer\neyes widened as she pulled back. She exchanged a questioning look\nwith Blaise that turned into a knowing one.</p>\n<p>\nShe\nlooked back at Harry with an appraising smile, \u201cI see,\u201d\nshe said to herself as she slowly backed away from him.</p>\n<p>\nWhen\nthe back of her legs hit the couch she stopped and looked over at\nDraco who was sitting stiffly in the centre. His arms were wrapped\nnervously around his waist, one hand clutching the neck of the whisky\nbottle as he scowled up at Harry.</p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>Your\nturn, Draco,\u201d Pansy said. When he didn\u2019t move immediately\nshe gave his ankle a half-hearted kick, \u201cCome on.\u201d</span></span></p>\n<p>\nBlaise\nleaned over, grabbing hold of his shoulder and pushing him forward,\n\u201cGive it a go, my friend. It\u2019s a laugh.\u201d</p>\n<p>\nDraco\nlooked over at Blaise furiously. A flush was rising in his cheeks as\nhe knocked Blaise\u2019s hand away and stood unsteadily, pushing the\nbottle into Pansy\u2019s chest with a bit too much force. She huffed and turned up her nose, flopping back onto the couch next to Blaise who leaned over to whisper in her ear. </p>\n<p>Draco wavered\non his feet, his eyes looking like he was\nhaving trouble focusing. He was completely and utterly pissed.</p>\n<p>\nHarry\nwatched with growing apprehension. Draco was flushed, his hair gone a\nlittle wild, even his clothes were slightly rumpled and there was a\ngrim determination in his eyes. He took a deep breath,\nabsent-mindedly pulling his shirt straight and smoothing his hair\nback with one hand, though it didn\u2019t stay.</p>\n<p>\nA\nprickle started on the back of Harry\u2019s neck, the hair on his\narms standing up. His heart rate began to pick up as the shivery\ntension raced through Harry with every step Draco got closer. He had\nfelt this before when they fought, this thundering, shivery pulling\nfeeling. Harry had always thought it was the adrenaline from being\nangry and from fighting but\u2026</p>\n<p>\nDraco\nstopped a foot away and then almost swayed forward until they were\nalmost touching. Harry saw close his eyes briefly as if gathering\nhimself, a shiver made his shoulder twitch. When he opened his eyes\nagain Harry felt transfixed by the flat grey colour. Harry\u2019s\nhand moving without his permission, pressing against the flat planes\nof Draco\u2019s chest,. Harry felt another shiver go through Draco,\nstronger than the last, his mouth falling open in a silent gasp, his\npupils darkening.</p>\n<p>\nHarry\nleaned forward, almost haltingly. He kept expecting the pressure to\nstart, to push him back, but instead, it almost felt like he was\nbeing tugged closer, and there was almost a static hum in the air,\nprickling along his skin. He reached up, brushing his fingers lightly\non Draco\u2019s chin, too nervous to actually cup his cheek. Draco\ntilted his head and Harry felt his breath ghost across his\nlips,\u00a0<i>felt</i>his lips, soft and careful and shivering just\nlike Harry was and-</p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>ENOUGH!\u201d\nHeadmistress McGonagall\u2019s voice cut through the party like a\nblade of ice. \u201cThis party is\u00a0</span></span><i><span>over.</span></i><span><span>\u201d</span></span></p>\n<p>\nHarry\nand Draco startled away from each other. The music was shut off and\nthe room slowly took on the deathly calm of those who know they are\ncompletely and utterly hosed.</p>\n<p>\nMcGonagall\u2019s\neyes narrowed as she looked over the room, \u201cThere will be no\nmore parties, for the rest of the year,\u201d she said coldly,\n\u201cHogsmeade weekends are canceled and everyone here, including\neighth years, are to remain on the castle grounds for the next three\nmonths-\u201d there was a chorus of groans that was abruptly cut off\nwith a single\u00a0<i>look</i>, \u201c-All of your curfews are now\nat eight pm,\u00a0<i>all of you</i>.\u201d There were no attempts to\ncomplain this time, simply an overwhelming and spreading air of\ndespair. \u201cIf you are going to act like children, you will\nbe\u00a0<i>treated</i>\u00a0like children. If any of you are found\nwith alcohol on school grounds again, you\u00a0<i>will</i>\u00a0be\nsuspended,\u201d she pursed her lips in disappointment, \u201cI do\nhope you will learn from this. Now go to your dorms.\u201d</p>\n<p>\nThe\nstudents swayed and shuffled out of the room with their heads low to\navoid eye contact.</p>\n<p>\nHarry\nhadn\u2019t moved. He wasn\u2019t entirely aware of what was\nhappening until a hand firmly took him by the upper arm.</p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>Mr\nPotter.\u201d McGonagall said, some of the sternness leaving her\nvoice, \u201cAre you well? Do you need to go to the hospital wing?\u201d</span></span></p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>I-\nWhat-?\u201d Harry asked blankly, his mind entirely consumed by a\nsingle kiss, so brief there was part of his mind that wasn\u2019t\nentity certain it had happened.</span></span></p>\n<p>\nMcGonagall\nfrowned, her question changing to an order, \u201cGo to the hospital\nwing. Have Poppy look you over.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>The\nhospital wing,\u201d Harry repeated.</span></span></p>\n<p>\nThe\nroom was entirely empty. Harry didn\u2019t know when that had\nhappened.</p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>You\u2019re\ntrembling Harry,\u201d McGonagall said, looking Harry over with\nconcern, \u00a0\u201cI\u2019ll walk you there myself.\u201d</span></span></p>\n<p><br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>Madam\nPomfrey had Harry spend the night in the hospital wing, just to be\nsafe.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\nHe\nwasn\u2019t sure he slept.</p>\n<p>\nHe\nspent a great deal of time staring at the ceiling, his mind on an\nendless loop of the kiss. Each time his mind played through it again,\nit focused on a different thing; the way Draco looked, then just his\nexpressions and then just his eyes. The way he felt, the way the kiss\nfelt, he remembered how he smelled.</p>\n<p>\nHe\ndidn\u2019t remember smelling him at the time but he was certain it\nwas fire whiskey, an aftershave or cologne that was a sharp mix of\nmusk and evergreen, with a hint of something spiced, all of it so\nfaint it was probably an exaggeration; he thought he remembered\nlemons, something citrus but he couldn\u2019t pinpoint where the\nidea had come from. He remembered the look Blaise and Pansy had given\neach other. He remembered how soft Draco\u2019s shirt felt against\nhis fingertips.</p>\n<p>\nHe\nremembered the kiss. He remembered the kiss.\u00a0<i>He remembered\nthe kiss.</i></p>\n<p>\nHis\nfirst kiss was with Draco Malfoy. His first kiss was at eighteen.\nHe\u2019d never been able to kiss anyone else, after trying hundreds\nof times\u00a0<i>and his first kiss was with Draco Malfoy.</i></p>\n<p>\nHe\nneeded to go find Ron and Hermione. He needed to talk to them so\nbadly he thought he might burst. He knew Madam Pomfrey would not be\npleased but Harry left the hospital wing as soon as he thought he his\nfriends wouldn\u2019t strangle him for waking them up.</p>\n<p>\nBefore\nhe even realized it he was running back to the dorm. Bursting inside\nand startling the only person in the common room, Hermione. She was\nreading in front of the fire, looking no worse for wear considering\nthe night before.</p>\n<p>\nHer\neyebrows shot up when she saw Harry, closing her book with a snap as\nshe stood, \u201cThere you are! You disappeared after the party and\nno one knew where you were!\u201d</p>\n<p>\nHarry\ncrossed the floor, talking between breaths, \u201cMcGonagall took me\nto the hospital wing but that\u2019s not important-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>The\nhospital wing!\u201d Hermione\u2019s eyes widened, \u201cAre you\nalright?\u201d</span></span></p>\n<p>\nHarry\nreached out, gently desperately grasping Hermione\u2019s forearms\nwith both hands, \u201cI\u2019m fine! Not important!\u00a0<i>Listen</i>-\u201d</p>\n<p>\nHermione\u2019s\nbrow furrowed, \u201cHarry-\u201d</p>\n<p>\nHarry\nwas practically bouncing on his toes, \u201cListen, please, Mione-\nI\u00a0<i>kissed</i> someone!\u201d</p>\n<p>\nHer\nbrow furrowed further, \u201cHarry\u2026 you kissed nearly\neveryone last night. Does Madam Pomfrey know you left?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>I\ndidn\u2019t-\u201d Harry bit his lip briefly, \u201cYou know how I\ncouldn\u2019t kiss Cho?\u201d</span></span></p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>In\u00a0</span></span><i><span>fifth</span></i><span><span>\u00a0</span></span><i><span>year</span></i><span><span>?\nHarry, I\u2019m worried-\u201d</span></span></p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>The\nthing is-\u201d Harry said quickly, talking over her all in a rush,\n\u201c-I haven\u2019t been able to kiss\u00a0</span></span><i><span>anyone</span></i><span><span>.\u201d</span></span></p>\n<p>\nHermione\nfroze, her eyes widening slowly, \u201cWhat?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>Last\nnight was the\u00a0</span></span><i><span>first\ntime</span></i><span><span>,\u201d\nHarry added, his voice dropping as the energy seemed to drain out of\nhim. He realized he was still holding onto Hermione\u2019s arms and\nquickly let go, pull his hands back to his chest.</span></span></p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>You\u2019re\nsure?\u201d</span></span></p>\n<p>\nHarry\nnodded.</p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>Why\ndidn\u2019t you tell us?\u201d Hermione asked a faint sadness in\nher tone.</span></span></p>\n<p>\nHarry\ngrimaced apologetically, \u201cThere was a lot going on. It\nwasn\u2019t\u2026\u00a0<i>important</i>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>Well,\nit is now,\u201d Hermione huffed, shaking her head, \u201cHow many\npeople have you tried to kiss?\u201d</span></span></p>\n<p>\nHarry\nshrugged one shoulder, \u201cA hundred or two maybe? I wasn\u2019t\nexactly keeping count.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>Okay,\u201d\nHermione said thoughtfully, \u201cWell, I\u2019m going to the\nlibrary. There are three books I know of that I can start with.\nYou\u2019re going to bed.\u201d</span></span></p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>What?\u201d\nHarry asked in a surge of confusion, pushing his hand through his\nhair.</span></span></p>\n<p>\nHermione\ntook him by the shoulder and pointed him at the dorm stairs, \u201cYou\nlook awful. Go get a few hours rest, I\u2019ll wake you once I\u2019ve\nfinished my preliminary research.\u201d</p>\n<p>\nHarry\nnodded as a wave of exhaustion swept over him. Just knowing that\nHermione knew, that she was looking into it, took an enormous weight\noff his shoulders. He slipped into the boys dorm filled with the\nreassuring sound of a bunch of blokes snoring and grumbling and\nfarting in their sleep. Harry didn\u2019t even bother pulling his\ncurtains closed and fell asleep as soon as his head hit the pillow.</p>\n<p><br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p><br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>\nHarry\nwoke with a start as Hermione dropped herself and a pile of books on\nthe end of his bed, \u201cWha-! Hermione?\u201d He rubbed his eyes\nand then scrubbed his hair, blinding reaching up next to his pillow\nwhere he put his glasses and then sleepily sliding them on.</p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>It\u2019s\nnearly time for lunch so I thought I\u2019d better wake you so you\ndon\u2019t miss it and also to tell you what I\u2019ve found,\u201d\nHermione said all in a rush, already flipping open one of her books.</span></span></p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>Lunch?\u201d\nRon groaned from the next bed, shoving his blankets down and\nstretching.</span></span></p>\n<p>\nHermione\nrolled her eyes, \u201cYes, lunch. You slept through breakfast.\u201d</p>\n<p>\nRon\nslowly sat up and looked around the empty dorm, \u201cHarry slept\nthrough too,\u201d he pointed out.</p>\n<p>\nHermione\nshook her head, \u201cYes but Harry didn\u2019t sleep much last\nnight so it doesn\u2019t count.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>Nothing\nwrong with a bit of a lie in on sunday,\u201d Ron\nmuttered as he stood, stumbling over to Harry\u2019s bed and sitting\ndown next to him, \u201cNightmares?\u201d he asked.</span></span></p>\n<p>\nHarry\nshook his head, feeling his cheeks start to get hot. With a few hours\nsleep and the morning light to separate him from what had happened\nthe night before, the whole, not kissing anyone thing, seemed a bit\nsilly and a lot more embarrassing.</p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>Harry\nsays he\u2019s never kissed anyone, that he\u2019s been repelled\nfrom every person he\u2019s tried,\u201d Hermione said in her\nno-nonsense, academic tone.</span></span></p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>Wot?\nLike every-everyone?\u201d Ron asked, his brow furrowed, \u201cEven\nGinny?\u201d</span></span></p>\n<p>\nHarry\nnodded, \u201cYeah, even her. But last night-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>It\u2019s\nsurprisingly hard to find much research on magical signatures and how\nthey interact,\u201d Hermione cut him off, \u201cWhat I have found\nwritten about it makes it sound like a fun little side project the\nauthor just tinkered around with. The general impression I got is\nthat your situation is very, very rare. So rare it\u2019s not\nmentioned at all. I\u2019ve been thinking of looking into the\nmedical books. Maybe\u2019s it\u2019s a magical medical condition\nof some sort\u2026\u201d</span></span></p>\n<p>\nRon\nyawned, \u201cSo it\u2019s like The Princess and Priestess then?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>The\nwhat?\u201d Harry asked.</span></span></p>\n<p>\nHermione\nlooked up from her book in confusion, \u201cWhat are you talking\nabout, Ron?\u201d</p>\n<p>\nRon\nlooked from Hermione to Harry, \u201cIt\u2019s a fairy-story. Do\nmuggles not have that one?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>Guess\nnot,\u201d Harry said, whose knowledge of children\u2019s stories\nwas fairly limited thanks to the Dursleys.</span></span></p>\n<p>\nHermione\nshook her head, \u201cI\u2019ve never heard of it.\u00a0<i>What in\nthe world</i>\u00a0does it have to do with Harry\u2019s\npredicament?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>It\u2019s\nkind of the same thing, really,\u201d Ron said, his brow scrunching\nup in thought, \u201cIt\u2019s been ages but it goes kinda like: A\nlong time ago there was a Princess of this kingdom and she was\nsupposed to marry this other Prince bloke but on the day of their\nwedding, they couldn\u2019t kiss,\u201d He raised his hands,\nshowing a gap between the two of a few inches, \u201cand in their\nculture, the marriage couldn\u2019t happen if the kiss didn\u2019t\nhappen. So the King arranges for more princes, and none of them can\nkiss her. So he calls in all the nobles, and none of them can kiss\nher either.</span></span></p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>And\nthe King\u2019s so worried about his daughter not getting married\nand being alone for the rest of her life, he says anyone who can kiss\nher can have the Princess\u2019 hand in marriage. The whole kingdom\ngets flooded with people hoping to get lucky, lines going around the\ncity, people camping for weeks to get a chance and over and over\nagain, no one can kiss the Princess. She\u2019s really upset about\nall of this-\u201d</span></span></p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>As\nshe should be!\u201d Hermione said, \u201cBeing treated like\ncattle. Doesn\u2019t she get any say in this?!\u201d</span></span></p>\n<p>\nRon\nsmiled lopsidedly, \u201cMione, let me finish. It was a\nlong,\u00a0<i>long</i>\u00a0time ago and a fairy story. Anyway; she\u2019s\nupset and starts going to the temple every night to pray to their\ngods. At night only a single Priestess watches the temple and they\nstart talking to one another, becoming friends. Until soon the\nPrincess is coming to the temple to see the Priestess rather than\npray and they\u2019re talking all night, every night.</p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>One\nday Princess realizes she\u2019s in love with the Priestess but\nsince she can\u2019t kiss anyone they\u2019ll never be able to be\ntogether. She tells the Priestess she\u2019s going to kill herself\nbecause she\u2019s so unhappy and can\u2019t live without her. The\nPriestess begs her not to and tells her that she loves the Princess\nmore than anyone in the world.\u201d</span></span></p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>She\nwas going to kill herself?\u201d Harry asked in disbelief.</span></span></p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>Fairy-stories,\u201d\nRon said with a shrug as if that explained it all, \u201cThey decide\nto get married. Even if they can\u2019t kiss, they want to spend the\nrest of their lives together. The King agrees because he\u2019s\nnever seen his daughter so happy before. They say their vows and then\nthey kiss, as easy as anything because it\u2019s true love and\nthey\u2019re perfect for each other, happily ever after, the end and\nall that guff.\u201d</span></span></p>\n<p>\nHermione\nlooked sceptical, \u201cAnd you think this story is about magical\nsignatures and that the Princess\u2019 was so\u2026 different, it\nrepelled everyone but the Priestess.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>Right\nand the Princess and Priestess were absolutely perfect for one\nanother, that\u2019s why they could kiss. Every kid from a magic\nhousehold knows the story. It\u2019s in pretty much every collection of the old stories.\u201d Ron said, \u201cGinny really\nliked it when she was little. Bill too, always a bit of a romantic\nour Bill.\u201d</span></span></p>\n<p>\nHermione\nsighed, \u201cIt\u2019s not terrible for a fairy tale but it\ndoesn\u2019t really help Harry.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>He\njust has to find his Priestess,\u201d Ron said and grinned in a\nmischievous way, \u201cShouldn\u2019t be too hard, the whole\nwizarding world would gladly kiss you\u00a0</span></span><i><span>now</span></i><span><span>.\nOnce they find out you\u2019re like the Princess, you\u2019ll be\nbeating them off with sticks.\u201d</span></span></p>\n<p>\nHarry\ncouldn\u2019t look them in the eye. His whole face felt hot.</p>\n<p>\nWas\nDraco Malfoy-?</p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>Only\none person?\u201d Harry asked faintly.</span></span></p>\n<p>\nHermione\nsnorted, \u201cHighly doubtful. It\u2019s a random magical\nsignature, the chances of being highly compatible with\nonly\u00a0<i>one</i>\u00a0person and incompatible with literally\nevery single other person in the world is impossible. It\u2019s far\nmore likely that he\u2019s either compatible with a few random\npeople or with no one at all.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>Real\nhelpful, Hermione,\u201d Ron said under his breath.</span></span></p>\n<p>\nHermione\nfrowned and shoved his shoulder, \u201cOh, shut it, Ron. Besides,\nHarry said he kissed someone last night, that\u2019s how this whole\nthing started.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>Oh,\u201d\nRon said and then grinned, elbowing Harry conspiratorially in the\nside, \u201cWho is it, mate? They cute? Divine? Your perfect,\nsoul-shattering love? The Priestess to your Princess?\u201d</span></span></p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>Why\nam I the Princess in this scenario?\u201d Harry asked.</span></span></p>\n<p>\nHermione\nrolled her eyes and smiled faintly.</p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>Just\nfits.\u201d Ron went on, \u201cDid you get all shivery when you\nkissed them? Did it curl your toes? Butterflies in your stomach,\nheart racing, birds singing-\u201d</span></span></p>\n<p>\nHermione\ninterrupted him with a laugh, \u201cRon!\u201d</p>\n<p>\nHarry\nflushed, \u201c\u2026I mean, It was just for a second but- kinda,\nyeah.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>You\nwanna know too,\u201d Ron said to Hermione. He sniffed theatrically,\n\u201cOur little boy\u2019s all grown up. His first proper\nromance.\u201d</span></span></p>\n<p>\nHarry\nlaughed weakly, feeling impossibly nervous about the question they\nwere sure to ask.</p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>Just\nbecause Harry\u00a0</span></span><i><span>can</span></i><span><span>\u00a0kiss\nthem doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s going to\u00a0</span></span><i><span>like</span></i><span><span>\u00a0them,\u201d\nHermione said.</span></span></p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>They\npractically have to.\u201d Ron said, \u201cThat\u2019s how it\nworks!\u201d</span></span></p>\n<p>\nHermione\nsniffed, unconvinced, \u201cSounds like another fairy tale to me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\nRon\nrolled his eyes and then leaned over to nudge Harry\u2019s shoulder,\n\u201cWho is it then?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>Erm,\nwell\u2026\u201d Harry took a deep breath and blurted out,\n\u201cDracoMalfoy.\u201d</span></span></p>\n<p>\nWhatever\nRon was going to say turned into a strangled wheeze in his throat.</p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>Oh,\u201d\nHermione said faintly.</span></span></p>\n<p>\nRon\nstared unseeing into the distance with an expression of profound\nregret for everything he had said in the last ten minutes.</p>\n<p>\nHermione\nawkwardly cleared her throat, \u201cThat\u2019s- that\u2019s-\ncertainly,\u201d she paused glancing up briefly, \u201cI was going\nto say unexpected but considering Malfoy and your whole-\u201d she\nvaguely waved a hand, \u201c-relationship. I suppose, it\u2019s\nnot\u00a0<i>that</i>strange.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>It\u2019s\nnot?\u201d Harry said.</span></span></p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>Well,\u201d\nHermione said carefully, \u201cYou saved his life, he saved yours\u2026\nYou stalked him for a year, he climbed a tree and made a hundred\nhandmade \u2018Potter Stinks\u2019 badges to taunt you\u2026\u201d</span></span></p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>You\ncalled him you arch-enemy for ages,\u201d Ron said, \u201cYou had\nVoldemort trying to kill you and you\ncalled\u00a0</span></span><i><span>Malfoy</span></i><span><span>\u00a0your\u00a0</span></span><i><span>arch-enemy.\u00a0</span></i><span><span>When\nyou were like twelve. No one has arch-enemies when they\u2019re\ntwelve.\u201d</span></span></p>\n<p>\nHarry\nsaid, \u201cRivals. I said rivals for sure-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>Nah,\u201d\nRon shook his head, \u201cYou said arch-enemies, mate. It\u2019s a\nbit barmy looking back on it.\u201d</span></span></p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>Are\nyou sure?\u201d Hermione asked.</span></span></p>\n<p>\nHarry\u2019s\nbrow furrowed, \u201cAbout what?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>That\nyou kissed him.\u201d Seeing Harry\u2019s expression Hermione\nquickly raised both hands and waved them placatingly, \u201cYou were\ndrunk and it was loud and crowded and it was Malfoy! It would be more\nstrange not to check, wouldn\u2019t it?\u201d</span></span></p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>I\u2019ve\nspent my whole life, and a lot of it recently,\u00a0</span></span><i><span>not\u00a0</span></i><span><span>kissing\npeople, I\u2019m quite certain I can tell once I\u2019ve actually\nmanaged it,\u201d Harry said a little sharply, \u201cI couldn\u2019t\nstop thinking about it. I couldn\u2019t sleep because of it.\u201d</span></span></p>\n<p>\nRon\nand Hermione glanced at each other pointedly.</p>\n<p>\nHermione\ncleared her throat and said, \u201cThe more important question here,\nis, how do you feel about him?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>I\ndon\u2019t know?\u201d Harry said a bit helplessly, \u201cHe\u2019s\nquite good looking-\u201d</span></span></p>\n<p>\nRon\nand Hermione exchanged another look.</p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>-\nbut I haven\u2019t talked to him since the trials. He said 'Thank\nyou\u2019 after it was all over and that was it!\u201d</span></span></p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>You\nwant to talk to him then?\u201d Ron asked.</span></span></p>\n<p>\nHarry\nscrubbed miserably at his hair, \u201cI don\u2019t- Maybe? It\u2019s\nstrange that we haven\u2019t isn\u2019t it? Every year I\u2019ve\nbeen at school he\u2019s tracked me down as soon as we were on the\ntrain just to say something.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>and\nthe one year he didn\u2019t you went to him,\u201d Ron said.</span></span></p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>Do\nyou like him?\u201d Hermione asked.</span></span></p>\n<p>\nHarry\ngroaned, \u201cHow am I supposed to know that?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>Get\nto know him?\u201d Ron suggested a little sarcastically, \u201cYou\ncould try talking to him like a normal person for one. And flirting?\u201d\nhe grimaced, \u201cNo, never mind, you\u2019re rubbish that. No\ninsults, o'course, no name calling, that goes for us as well I\nsuppose, and no fights,\u201d he sighed, \u201cI suppose I\u2019ll\nhave to treasure the time one time I did get to punch the whiny\nlittle tit.\u201d</span></span></p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>You\u2019re\nbeing surprisingly supportive about all this, Ron,\u201d Hermione\nsaid with a furrow in her brow and a funny little smile.</span></span></p>\n<p>\nRon\nsighed and rubbed the back of his neck, \u201cYou grew up with\nmuggles, so I guess you don\u2019t know, but- it\u2019s like- a\nstrong match between two people is\u00a0<i>really rare</i>\u00a0and\nwhen it happens it\u2019s meant to be- you can\u2019t just-\u201d\nhe gestured vaguely with open hands, \u201c<i>not</i>. It\u2019s\nspecial. It\u2019s doubly more important if Malfoy\u2019s\nthe\u00a0<i>only</i>\u00a0person Harry can even kiss.\u201d</p>\n<p>\nHermione\nrolled her eyes, \u201cHe\u2019s not the\u00a0<i>only</i>\u00a0one.\nThe odds of that are ridiculous.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>So?\u201d\nRon shrugged, \u201cWhat good is it going to do Harry if he can kiss\na random wizard in the middle of china or a witch up in canada? He\u2019s\nfound one here!\u201d</span></span></p>\n<p>\nHermione\nfrowned, \u201cYes, well, you might have a point.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>Thank\nyou!\u201d Ron said with a triumphant smile.</span></span></p>\n<p>\nThey\nall went quiet for a moment and then Harry laughed and said dryly,\n\u201cNow that that\u2019s all sorted, everything else is just a\npiece of piss.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>In\nthe end, it\u2019s up to you really,\u201d Hermione said.</span></span></p>\n<p>\nRon\nmanaged an uneven smile, \u201cSweep him off his feet, mate.\u201d</p>\n<p><br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p><br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>Harry\nwent to Charms early. It was one of the classes all the eighth years\ntook together and Harry was fairly certain Pansy and Blaise usually\nsat together while Draco sat alone in the back corner. So, all he had\nto do was wait and then once Draco came in, he could follow him to\nwhatever desk he choose and sit with him. Then, if Draco didn\u2019t\nautomatically hex him, they could talk a bit. And if that went well,\nhe could do it again and once they were on friendly terms he could\u2026\nask him out?</p>\n<p>\nHarry\nleaned back against the wall near the door, squeezing the strap of\nhis bag tighter as he thought. Maybe he\u2019d get lucky and Draco\u2019d\nbe pleased about the kiss too, then he could just skip straight to\nasking him out. He shook his head slightly, even then they needed to\ntalk about things. Draco had been better since the war but that\ndidn\u2019t make everything that had happened before disappear.</p>\n<p>\nHe\nforced himself to pay more attention as students started coming in,\nlooking for a white blond head. As the seats began to fill, Pansy and\nBlaise came in, Draco just behind, his nose buried in a book. Harry\npractically held his breath as he followed the trio up the risers.\nSecond to last row in the back Pansy and Blaise dropped into a pair\nof seats, they were talking together in low whispers, a notepad full\nof scribbled notes between them. Draco went another row back and then\nwalked down to the very last desk in the corner. He sat in the\nclosest seat, so Harry couldn\u2019t very well sit next to him\nwithout trying to slip past and his plan was already so far past the\npoint of believability he didn\u2019t dare. Maybe after a few chats.</p>\n<p>\nHarry\npaused, so it wouldn\u2019t be quite so obvious he had been\nfollowing Draco and to gather his nerve. He glanced back at the other\ndesks, only Ron and Hermione were watching him from a shared desk in\nthe front row. Hermione nodded slightly and Ron gave him a\nsurreptitious thumbs up.</p>\n<p>\nHe\ndecided to stop thinking about it and just went, sitting in the desk\nand chair closest to Draco, so only the narrow aisle separated them.\nDraco eyebrow twitched, his mouth tightened slightly but he didn\u2019t\nlook up.</p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>Is\nit alright if I sit here?\u201d Harry asked watching Draco\u2019s\nexpression closely.</span></span></p>\n<p>\nDraco\u2019s expression didn\u2019t change but his shoulders tensed, \u201cIt\u2019s\nfine,\u201d he said shortly.</p>\n<p>\nHarry\npulled his bag onto his lap, looking for his book and setting it on\nhis desk, quickly followed by a scrap of parchment for notes and a\npen. Once that was out of the way, he went back to watching Draco.</p>\n<p>\nDraco\ncarefully removed his own things from his bag and set them up so\nneatly Harry thought he might be able to place a ruler between them\nall. He went back to reading his book, a furrow between his brow\ndeepening as he stared at the page, eyes unmoving. He shifted his\nweight uneasily, leaning even closer to his book so his hair slipped\ndown over his forehead.</p>\n<p>\nDraco\nsat up with a huff, briskly pushing his hair back and turned in his\nseat so he was directly facing Harry, \u201cWhat do you want,\nPotter?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>To\ntalk,\u201d Harry said and then quickly added, \u201cto you.\u201d</span></span></p>\n<p>\nDraco\u2019s\nmouth twitched down. He shot a nervous glance down at Pansy and\nBlaise just below, dropping his voice to hiss, \u201cIt wasn\u2019t\nmy idea and I have nothing to do with it at all. Nothing,\nunderstand?\u201d</p>\n<p>\nHarry\u2019s\nbrow furrowed and he was about to ask Draco what he meant when\nProfessor Flitwick came in and started his lecture. The question\ngnawed at Harry through the whole lecture so he wasn\u2019t even\nsure what it was about when class let out. Not that he got to ask\nwhen class let out because Malfoy scooped everything into his bag and\nrushed out the door like he had a dementor at his heel, leaving Harry\nmore confused than ever.</p>\n<p><br>\n</p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>What\ndo you suppose Malfoy meant?\u201d Ron asked fighting back a yawn as\nthey headed down to breakfast.</span></span></p>\n<p>\nHarry\nshrugged, \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p>\n<p>\nHermione\npulled open her bag as they walked, fishing inside the unfathomable\ndepths to retrieve a rather daunting medical text, \u201cDid you try\nasking him?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>Would\nhave if he hadn\u2019t avoided me like the plague,\u201d Harry said\ngrumpily, \u201cI just-\u201d he frowned.</span></span></p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>What?\u201d\nRon asked.</span></span></p>\n<p>\nHarry\nnodded towards the doors to the great hall from which loud shouts and\nchatter spilled out. Harry started to hang back and Ron fell back\nwith him so Hermione peered around the doorframe. She frowned and\nlooked up, stepping further into the room. An owl that had been\nperched in the rafters swooped down and dropped a folded Prophet to\nher. With paper in hand, she stepped back into the hall.</p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>The\nProphet?\u201d Ron asked.</span></span></p>\n<p>\nHermione\nquickly unrolled it, \u201cThey\u2019re all reading it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>Not\nthe Prophet,\u201d Harry bemoaned, already anticipating the worst.</span></span></p>\n<p>\nThe main headline was:\u00a0<i>Exclusive!

In addition to two photos of Harry\nand an illustration from a children\u2019s book, the whole thing\ntook up the entire front page of the paper.</p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>Rough\nluck, mate,\u201d Ron said grimly.</span></span></p>\n<p>\nHermione\ngave him a conciliatory look, \u201cIt\u2019s amazing it took this\nlong for someone to work it out really, with the number of people\nyou\u2019ve tried to kiss.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>Thanks\nthat really helps,\u201d Harry said sarcastically.</span></span></p>\n<p>\nHermione\nmade a face at him and went on pointedly, \u201c<i>And</i>\u00a0it\nwasn\u2019t written by Skeeter, she would have blown it entirely out\nof proportion. This is fairly accurate and pretty well written\nreally, for the Prophet anyway. I wonder if this P.P. is a new\nreporter.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>Pansy\nParkinson,\u201d Harry said flatly.</span></span></p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>Her?\nReally?\u201d Ron asked, leaning on Harry\u2019s shoulder to get a\nbetter look.</span></span></p>\n<p>\nHarry\nnodded, remembering the pointed look she had shared with Blaise after\ntrying to kiss him and the two of them with their notebook in Charms\nyesterday, probably working out the article together.</p>\n<p>\nAs\nif summoned, Pansy\u2019s excited giggle proceeded her through the\ndoorway with Blaise by her side. It took the two of them a while to\nrealize they were being stared at and by whom but once they did they\nfroze.</p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>You\nwrote this?\u201d Harry pointed to the newspaper.</span></span></p>\n<p>\nPansy\ntried to surreptitiously shift the paper she was holding slightly\nfurther back and behind her leg, \u201cWhere in the world would you\nget an idea like that?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>The\nparty,\u201d Harry ticked off on his fingers, \u201cThe two of you\nworking on it in Charms, the initials.\u201d</span></span></p>\n<p>\nBlaise\nsmirked, leaning over Pansy\u2019s shoulder in an almost exact\nmirror of Ron, \u201cSo?\u201d</p>\n<p>\nHarry\nwasn\u2019t certain on that account.</p>\n<p>\nPansy\nshrugged Blaise off in annoyance, \u201cGet off, you,\u201d she\nturned back to Harry with a sniff and absentmindedly straightened her\nhair, \u201cIt\u2019s not like I said anything that wasn\u2019t\ntrue.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>It\u2019s\nmuch better than Skeeter\u2019s work,\u201d Hermione said.</span></span></p>\n<p>\nPansy\npositively beamed, \u201cIsn\u2019t though? It\u2019s about time\nthat gossipy shrew was kicked off the front page.\u201d</p>\n<p>\nHermione\nglanced at Harry and Ron thoughtfully and then back to Pansy, \u201cAre\nyou going to keep writing for them? The Prophet?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>Two\nmore lead stories and they\u2019ve promised me a permanent\nposition,\u201d Pansy said.</span></span></p>\n<p>\nHermione\nlooked at Harry pointedly, raising her eyebrows, \u201cShe\u2019s\nbetter than Skeeter.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>Oh,\u201d\nHarry said as he caught on and looked at Pansy.</span></span></p>\n<p>\nPansy\nlooked at him and Hermione warily, \u201cWhat?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>Well\u2026\u201d\nHarry said carefully, \u201cIf you keep writing things, truthful\nthings\u2026 I might be more willing to talk to you than other\nreporters.\u201d</span></span></p>\n<p>\nPansy\nsmiled excitedly, \u201cReally?! Really really?!\u201d</p>\n<p>\nHarry\nnodded, wondering if he would come to regret this.</p>\n<p>\nPansy\ngrabbed Blaise\u2019s arm, bouncing excitedly on her toes, \u201cCan\nyou believe it!\u201d she crowed, then turned to Harry, \u201cWhen\ncould I-? Not now, of course. Next week maybe? For an interview. Or\nwhenever, but before we finish school or so help me I\u2019ll-\u201d</p>\n<p>\nBlaise\ncareful placed his hand over her mouth, \u201cYou\u2019ll be very\nvery grateful for this opportunity,\u201d He pulled his hand away,\n\u201cNow smile and wish the nice people a good day.\u201d</p>\n<p>\nPansy\nsmacked Blaise\u2019s hand before he could pull it back. He clutched\nhis\u00a0hand to his chest with a wince.</p>\n<p>\n<span>\n<span>Pansy\nsmiled beatifically at Harry, \u201cThank you so much, Mr Potter. I\nshall speak with you later!\u201d She waved and they made their way\ndown the hall.</span>\n</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>Did\nI just agree to help Pansy Parkinson become a reporter for the\nnewspaper I loathe with every fibre of my being?\u201d Harry asked\nvaguely.</span></span></p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>It\nwas the best outcome really,\u201d Hermione said. She added\nvehemently, \u201cEspecially, if Skeeter\u00a0</span></span><i><span>never</span></i><span><span>\u00a0works\nagain.\u201d</span></span></p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>That\u2019s\nmy girl,\u201d Ron said brightly, slinging an arm over both their\nshoulders, \u201cNow if I don\u2019t get to breakfast I\u2019m\ngoing to die of starvation.\u201d</span></span></p>\n<p>\nHermione\nrolled her eyes, \u201cYou\u2019re not going to starve to death,\nRon. Harry, do you want to go in? Maybe we should go to the kitchens,\njust until this dies down a bit.\u201d</p>\n<p>\nHarry\nthought about it and sighed, \u201cI want to get it over with\nreally.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>Alright\nthen!\u201d Ron said steering them through the doors.</span></span></p>\n<p>\nThe\ninitial noise in the great hall had died down somewhat since they\u2019d\nstopped outside and once they entered, it died entirely, until you\ncould hear a pin drop. Everyone was staring at Harry.</p>\n<p>\nThe\none to break the silence ended up being Ginny, who shot off her bench\nand marched over to Harry with the Prophet in hand, \u201cIs this\ntrue?\u201d</p>\n<p>\nA\nhiss of whispers filled the hall.</p>\n<p>\nRon\nsaid, \u201cGin, this isn\u2019t really a good time-\u201d</p>\n<p>\nGinny\nignored her brother entirely, \u201cI need to know! Why didn\u2019t\nyou tell me? You could have just said, I\u2019d understand! I\nthought-\u201d her voice cracked, edged with tears that she furiously\npushed through, clenching her jaw and shaking her head, \u201cI\nthought it was something wrong with\u00a0<i>me</i>.\u201d she said\nquietly.</p>\n<p>\nHarry\nstepped closer to her, dropping his voice so no one could overhear,\n\u201cI just figured it out myself. Raised by muggles, remember?\nThere\u2019s nothing wrong with you, Ginny, you\u2019re perfect.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>Damn\nright I am,\u201d Ginny sniffed, roughly wiping her eyes.</span></span></p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>It\u2019s\nme that\u2019s got the worst luck, as per usual,\u201d Harry said\nruefully.</span></span></p>\n<p>\nGinny\nsmiled faintly and punched Harry in the shoulder, a little harder\nthan was friendly, \u201cWell, good luck, Princess.\u201d</p>\n<p>\nHarry\nwinced and frowned, \u201cWhy have I always got to be the princess?\nCan\u2019t I be the priestess?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>Princess\nfits better,\u201d Ginny said with a shrug, going back to her seat.</span></span></p>\n<p>\nRon\nheaded down the table to an empty space and Harry and Hermione\nfollowed. Out of the corner of his eye, Harry was aware that around\nthe room people were popping up in ones and two. He hoped they were\njust trying to get a better look, but a Hufflepuff girl broke that\nillusion by standing and marching over to him before he had even\nmanaged to sit down.</p>\n<p>\nHer\nwhole face went red as she said, a little too loudly in her\nnervousness, \u201cM-May I kiss you!?\u201d</p>\n<p>\nShe\nclenched her hands together in front of her, looking desperately\nhopeful and all of fourteen if that. The other students who had stood\nup began rushing over, forming a line behind her.</p>\n<p>\nHarry\u2019s\neyes widened and he took a step back, \u201cI don\u2019t-\u201d he\nlooked around for support and then up at the teacher\u2019s table.\nHeadmistress McGonagall had risen to her feet, she caught Harry\u2019s\neyes briefly and gave him a slight nod.</p>\n<p>\nThere\nwas a brief clap of noise followed by a deep magic induced silence,\n\u201cReturn to your tables,\u201d she paused briefly and when no\none had moved added sternly, \u201c<i>Now</i>, if you please.\u201d</p>\n<p>\nThe\nline broke up and hurried back to their seats. Harry quickly sat down\nas well.</p>\n<p>\nMcGonagall\npaused again to sweep the room with a disapproving look, \u201cThis\nis\u00a0<i>not</i>\u00a0a fairy-story. You will all leave Mr Potter\nalone. He is not to be harassed, pressured or otherwise ambushed in\norder to violate his personal boundaries. There\u00a0<i>will</i>\u00a0be\nramifications if anyone tries.\u201d She narrowed her eyes and said\nin a low voice, \u201cI hope that\u2019s understood.\u201d She\ntook the following silence as agreement and nodded sharply, returning\nto her seat.</p>\n<p>\nHarry\nloaded up his plate with a sigh.</p>\n<p>\nAcross\nfrom him, Seamus pulled out a notebook, flipping it open to a blank\npage, \u201cRight so, let\u2019s start off the betting with how\nlong it takes for the first plonker to jump our boy Harry. Any\ntakers?\u201d</p>\n<p>\nA\nfew hands went up. Dean pulled out a handful of sickles, \u201cEight\nsickles on an hour.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>Two\nsickles on ten minutes,\u201d Ginny said with a grin, tossing her\ncoins into the pile.</span></span></p>\n<p>\nSeamus\ngrinned and cast a tempus charm to start a counter, \u201cAny other\ntakers!?\u201d</p>\n<p>\nHarry\ngroaned and ducked his head as he ate.</p>\n<p>\nOnce\nall the takers on that were up, Seamus set up a betting pool on how\nlong it would take for someone to get detention, how long it would\ntake before Harry was assigned a personal guard, and who would be his\nPriestess.</p>\n<p>\nThe\nfirst betting pool went to a perfect guess of twenty-six minutes when\na sixth year Ravenclaw boy rushed Harry and bounced off Harry's magical\nsignature like a ping pong ball and whacked his head on the floor,\nknocking himself out.</p>\n<p>\nLuna\nwon eleven galleons and five sickles.</p>\n<p><br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>Draco\nhad avoided him again, the entire day. Not that Harry could easily\nescape the hovering crowd that seemed to follow him around ever since\nthe entire breakfast fiasco. Even the Ravenclaw boy giving himself a\nconcussion didn\u2019t dissuade five other students from trying to\nkiss him, four girls and one bloke, none of who even got close but\nalso managed not to injure themselves.</p>\n<p>\nHarry\nsquirmed restlessly where he lay on top of his bed. He had originally\nthought to have an early night but was pretty certain he wouldn\u2019t\nbe able to sleep. He grabbed the marauders map and unfolded it on his\nchest, looking over the castle. With the seventh and eighth years on\na constricted curfew and it getting near ten, the rest of the\nstudent\u2019s curfew, the hallways were nearly empty.</p>\n<p>\nHarry\nwas about the close the map when he saw something utterly unexpected,\nDraco Malfoy, at the top of the astronomy tower. He flung himself out\nof bed, only pausing to grab his cloak and hurrying down the stairs.\nIn the common room, Ron and Hermione were curled up together on one\nof the smaller couches by the fire.</p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>I\u2019m\ngoing out,\u201d Harry told them.</span></span></p>\n<p>\nHermione\u2019s\nbrow furrowed, \u201cWhat for?\u201d</p>\n<p>\nHarry\ngrinned, \u201cI\u2019ve got a temple to visit. Gods to pray to,\nthat sort of thing.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>Good\nluck then, with your \u2018praying\u2019,\u201d Ron finger quoted\n.</span></span></p>\n<p>\nHermione\nrolled her eyes and added, \u201cDon\u2019t get caught.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>Me?\u201d\nHarry scoffed, \u201cNever. I\u2019m the master of subterfuge.\u201d</span></span></p>\n<p>\nHarry\nslipped out the portrait, pulling the cloak around him as he hurried\ndown the hallways to the base of the tower. He checked the map one\nmore time, just to make sure he wouldn\u2019t be climbing the stairs\nfor nothing, then made his way up the winding steps. He took his\ncloak off before stepping out onto the landing.</p>\n<p>\nDraco\nwas all wrapped up in a fur-lined cloak, leaning against the stone\nparapet staring gloomily into the middle distance. A cold breeze was\ntugging at his hair, swirling it out of place, making him looked\nwindswept and ethereal under the light of a gibbous moon.</p>\n<p>\nHarry\ncast a warming charm over himself as he crossed the distance.</p>\n<p>\nDraco\nturned at the sound of him approaching, everything about him growing\nguarded as he recognized Harry, \u201cPotter. What are you doing up\nhere?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>I\ncould ask you the same thing,\u201d Harry said, \u201cSeems like\nthe sort place you\u2019d avoid.\u201d</span></span></p>\n<p>\nDraco\nshuddered, turning back to the parapet, bracing his arms on the top\nand looking out at a black horizon. \u201cI asked you first,\u201d\nhe said sullenly.</p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>Couldn\u2019t\nsleep,\u201d Harry said half-way truthfully, leaning on the wall.</span></span></p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>I\nsaid I had nothing to do with it,\u201d Draco said.</span></span></p>\n<p>\nHarry\u2019s\nbrow furrowed and then he blinked, \u201cOh! You mean the article. I\nknow Pansy wrote it. I talked to her.\u201d</p>\n<p>\nInstead\nof helping, this only seemed to make Draco bristle more, \u201cShe\ndidn\u2019t do anything wrong! She-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>I\nknow.\u201d</span></span></p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>-just\nwants to be a!-\u201d Draco froze, \u201cYou know?\u201d</span></span></p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>It\nwas an alright article. It\u2019s all true anyway.\u201d Harry\nsaid, glancing over at Draco.</span></span></p>\n<p>\nDraco\nstared at him with wide eyes, \u201cIt is? You really can\u2019t\nkiss\u00a0<i>anyone</i>?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>There\u2019s\none,\u201d Harry said.</span></span></p>\n<p>\nDraco\nfrowned, \u201cWell, good luck with that,\u201d he said bitterly.</p>\n<p>\nHarry\nlooked away, a faint and unfamiliar pain lodging in his chest.</p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>Don\u2019t\nyou have anything better to do, Potter?\u201d Draco asked.</span></span></p>\n<p>\nHarry\nsighed, \u201cYou never said why you\u2019re up here.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>Couldn\u2019t\nsleep,\u201d Draco muttered.</span></span></p>\n<p>Harry\nstared down at his hands, \u201cHow\u2019s your mother?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>You\u2019re\nasking me about my mother? Really, Potter?\u201d Draco asked in\ndismay.</span></span></p>\n<p>\nHarry\nglared at him, \u201cI thought it might be a safe subject to talk\nabout.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>Between\nus?\u201d Malfoy said, \u201cNothing is a safe subject.\u201d</span></span></p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>Only\nbecause you won\u2019t stop being a tit,\u201d Harry snapped.</span></span></p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>Says\nthe one who just called me a tit,\u201d Draco sneered.</span></span></p>\n<p>\nHarry\nreturned the expression mockingly, \u201cSays the one who won\u2019t\njust tell me how his mum\u2019s doing.\u201d</p>\n<p>\nDraco\nwas looking tense as a puffed cat, torn between hexing Harry or just\nleaving altogether.</p>\n<p>\nHarry\nleaned back and then took a step back, before looking away from Draco\naltogether. For a bit there, they had been close enough that Harry\ncould feel that faint buzz skating across his skin that made him want\nto shiver. He sighed and looked up at the stars wondering if the\noriginal Princess had this much trouble, then mentally cursed himself\nfor thinking of himself as the Princess.</p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>Mother\nis doing quite well, all things considered. She\u2019s been re-doing\nthe Manor,\u201d Draco said begrudgingly.</span></span></p>\n<p>\nHarry\nglanced over at him in surprise, quickly dragging his gaze back to\nthe sky before attempting to keep the conversation going, \u201cShe\u2019s\nredecorating?\u201d</p>\n<p>\nThere\nwas an interminable pause, which Harry was afraid wouldn\u2019t be\nfilled, before Draco answered, \u201c<i>No</i>, re-doing. Moving the\nwalls, replacing everything not nailed down, shoving heirlooms in the\nattic, all the furniture transfigured, new floors, new\npaint,\u00a0<i>wallpaper,</i>\u201d he said the last like a bad\ntaste in his mouth. \u201cAs if the last few years are a stain she\ncan scrub out if she just tries hard enough.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>Well,\u201d\nHarry hazarded, \u201cif it helps then\u2026 no reason not to.\u201d</span></span></p>\n<p>\u201c<i><span>Wallpaper</span></i><span><span>,\u201d\nDraco muttered then took a deep breath, \u201cShe asks after you in\nher letters. She won\u2019t tell me why, just something about what\nhappened in the forest and now she-\u201d he stopped abruptly.</span></span></p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>Well,\nI\u2019ve been alright. Certainly a lot better than-\u201d he\npaused, uncertain about finishing his own sentence. \u201c\u2026Erm,\nbefore,\u201d he finished lamely.</span></span></p>\n<p>\nDraco\nsaid stiffly, \u201cI would imagine that anything would be an\nimprovement over being hunted by a mass-murdering megalomaniac.\u201d</p>\n<p>\nHarry\nlooked over at Draco in surprise.</p>\n<p>\nDraco\nrolled his eyes at Harry\u2019s expression, \u201cI\u2019m not\nmade of glass.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>Alright,\u201d\nHarry said and nodded, \u201cYeah, better than that.\u201d</span></span></p>\n<p>\nDraco\u2019s\nbrow furrowed faintly as he looked away from Harry and back at his\nhands, \u201cWhat do you want, Potter?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>What?\u201d\nHarry asked in confusion.</span></span></p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>We\u2019re\nnot friends but this is the second time you\u2019ve done-\u201d\nDraco waved a hand absently, \u201c-whatever it is you\u2019re\ntrying to do here. You either want something from me or it\u2019s\npity. I won\u2019t be pitied, Potter.\u201d</span></span></p>\n<p>\nHarry\nsnorted, ignoring Draco\u2019s frown, \u201cI can\u2019t imagine\npitying you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\nDraco\u2019s\neyes narrowed, \u201cBollocks. That\u2019s utter fucking bollocks.\u201d</p>\n<p>\nHarry\nfound himself looking at Draco\u2019s hands, long elegant fingers as\nthey gripped at the stone, slowly dragging into loose fists.</p>\n<p>\nHarry\nsaid carefully,\u201c\u2026The way I look at it. I can\u2019t\nimagine many people could survive what you went through.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>What\nI-?!\u201d</span></span></p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>Do\nyou?\u201d Harry interrupted to ask, \u201cDo you think many people\ncould survive having Voldemort in their home, holding their parents\nhostage, threatening to kill them?\u201d</span></span></p>\n<p>\nWhat\nlittle colour was left in Draco\u2019s face disappeared and he\nswallowed hard, squeezing his eyes shut, \u201cYou could have. You\ncould have done more than just\u00a0<i>survive</i>,\u201d he said\nbitterly.</p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>If\nI had my parents, if\u00a0</span></span><i><span>he</span></i><span><span>\u00a0had\nmy parents-\u201d Harry bit his bottom lip and shook his head, \u201cI\ndon\u2019t know. I\u2019m not sure I could.\u201d</span></span></p>\n<p>\nDraco\ntook a deep breath and let it out slowly. Harry forced himself not to\nstare at Draco\u2019s face, glancing sidelong at his hands again and\nfeeling relieved when Draco relaxed them again. Harry could hear him\nbreathing; he felt like his own breathing was far too loud.</p>\n<p>\nDraco\nslid his hands over the stone, curling his finger over the edge, \u201cSo\nyou don\u2019t pity me. Fine. I still don\u2019t understand what\nyou want.\u201d</p>\n<p>\nHarry\ndropped his head, ruffling his hand through his hair as he mentally\nran through possible answers, most of which were entirely certain to\nmake Draco angry. He spoke slowly, making sure every word was in\nplace before saying the next, \u201cI want to get to know you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>Fuck\noff, does this look like sharing time to you?\u201d Draco said with\na sneer, whipping away from the parapet to leave.</span></span></p>\n<p>\nHarry\ngrabbed Draco\u2019s arm, \u201cWait! I- um- please just-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>Let\ngo of me or I\u2019ll hex your bollocks off!\u201d Draco stepped\nback, jerking his arm free. His eyes blazed, looking about ready to\ndo just that when he whirled away. The swirl of his cloak would have\nmade Snape proud.</span></span></p>\n<p>\nHarry\nleaned back against the parapet with a sigh.</p>\n<p><br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>How\u2019d\nit go?\u201d Ron asked as Harry came back into the common room.</span></span></p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>Well\u2026\nhe didn\u2019t hex my bollocks off.\u201d Harry huffed and dropped\ninto an overstuffed armchair next to his friends. The room was\nentirely empty except for them.</span></span></p>\n<p>\nRon\nnodded slightly like had expected that, crossing his arms over his\nchest, \u201cSpill it then.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>Ron!\u201d\nHermione exclaimed, smacking his arm.</span></span></p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>We\ncan\u2019t help if he doesn\u2019t tell us what happened.\u201d\nRon said, \u201cand it\u2019s not like anything\u00a0</span></span><i><span>happened</span></i><span><span>.\u201d</span></span></p>\n<p>\nHarry\nwinced, \u201cBrutal, mate.\u201d</p>\n<p>\nRon\nshrugged, \u201cIt\u2019s Malfoy.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>You\ndon\u2019t have to tell us anything,\u201d Hermione said, \u201cIn\nfact, you shouldn\u2019t feel obligated to try and win Malfoy over\nat all, just because of a- of a magical condition. Unless you want\nto, of course.\u201d</span></span></p>\n<p>\nHarry\nscrubbed his hands through his hair. He absolutely wasn\u2019t going\nto tell them about his growing obsession with Malfoy\u2019s hair or\nbeautiful hands. Instead, he told them an abbreviated version of\ntheir conversation.</p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>That\u2019s\nnot too bad really,\u201d Hermione hazarded once he had finished.\n\u201cYou were able to talk for\u2026a bit.\u201d</span></span></p>\n<p>\nRon\nwas staring blankly at the empty chess board on the table in front of\nhim, arms still firmly crossed.</p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>Ron?\u201d\nHermione asked.</span></span></p>\n<p>\nRon\u2019s\nbrow furrowed, his eyes narrowing but didn\u2019t answer her.</p>\n<p>\nHarry\nand Hermione exchanged a look.</p>\n<p>\nRon\nleaned forwards slowly and opened the box of chess pieces and took\nout the kings, setting them on opposite sides of the board, \u201cThe\nthing is, you and Malfoy used to be on equal ground,\u201d he tapped\nthe white king and then the black king, \u201cbut the war has\nchanged everything.\u201d He took out the two white castles and set\nthem on either side of the black king, \u201cSo, he was raised a\nking, but has been dethroned,\u201d he slid the king back off the\nsquares and took out a black pawn to put in its place, \u201cYou\ntalked to him like an equal but he, being a prickly little tit, is\nvery aware of the difference of what he is compared to what he used\nto be.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>So-?\u201d\nHarry asked.</span></span></p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>You\nneed to-\u201d Ron paused his eyes narrowing, \u201che\u2019s in a\nposition of weakness, you can\u2019t ask more from him.\u201d Ron\nstared at the board for a long moment and then reached into the box,\npulling out a white pawn and setting it in front of the white king,\n\u201cYou need to offer him something, give him power over you, or\nat least equivalent power.\u201d</span></span></p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>Oh,\u201d\nHermione\u2019s eyebrows rose and she laughed as she threw her arms\naround Ron hugging him enthusiastically, \u201cYou\u2019re right!\nYou\u2019re entirely right!\u201d</span></span></p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>Yeah?\u201d\nRon flushed faintly, looking pleased.</span></span></p>\n<p>\nHarry\u2019s\nvoice was edged with frustration, \u201cRight about what?\u201d</p>\n<p>\nHermione\nplanted a kiss on Ron\u2019s cheek before pulling away. She cleared\nher throat dramatically, all business again, \u201cYou need to tell\nhim something about yourself first. You asking him, he\u2019s\nprobably thinking it\u2019s more like an interrogation than a\ngenuine desire to get to know him. If you offer him something first\nhe might be more open to talking with you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\nHarry\nnodded, \u201cI can do that. You think that will help?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>Maybe?\u201d\nRon said with a bit of a shrug, putting the chess pieces away.</span></span></p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>You\nreally want to keep doing this?\u201d Hermione asked.</span></span></p>\n<p>\nHarry\nfelt himself flush faintly and ducked his head, \u201cYeah, I do.\u201d</p>\n<p><br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p><br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p><br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>\nHarry\ndrifted close to the walls as he walked through the dark castle\nhallways heading for the Great Hall where Draco\u2019s dot on the\nmap had been last. Inside, the sconces along the walls were unlit but\nthe candles still hovered over the long student tables. The\nflickering flames added new stars to the enchanted sky above which\nwas clear and bright with a billion pinpricks of light.</p>\n<p>\nDraco\nwas sitting on the edge of the head teachers table, swinging his legs\nback and forth idly as he craned his neck back to look up at the\nfalse sky. The moon shone through the windows behind him, crowning\nhim with a silver halo of light.</p>\n<p>\nHarry\nleaned against the door frame, taking a deep breath to brace himself.\nThe thing was, he had always rather noticed Draco, his hair and his\nvoice and the way he gestured. Harry had noticed him a great deal\nmore than anyone else and he didn\u2019t even really realize he was\ndoing it unless someone pointed it out. He just found his eyes drawn\nto the flash of white-blond hair and turned when he heard his voice.\nHarry wondered if maybe everything had been leading up to this in\nsome sort of roundabout way and if it had, and what Ron said was\ntrue, then Draco must have felt it too, a bit at least.</p>\n<p>\nHarry\ntook the silencing spell off his shoes and pulled his cloak off.</p>\n<p>\nDraco\njumped slightly when Harry crossed the floor and then glared. He\nwaited until Harry was closer so he could keep his voice down to a\nhiss, \u201cAre you stalking me, Potter?\u201d</p>\n<p>\nHarry\nstopped at the bottom of the risers leading up the head table,\nlooking up at Draco. Before he could answer, Draco threw in another\nbarb.</p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>I\nshould say, stalking me\u00a0</span></span><i><span>again</span></i><span><span>.\nYou never do know when to leave well enough alone. Always poking your\nnose where it doesn\u2019t belong, trying to make things\u00a0</span></span><i><span>right,</span></i><span><span>\u201d\nDraco sneered.</span></span></p>\n<p>\nHarry\nhesitated and then nodded, \u201cYeah.\u201d</p>\n<p>\nDraco\ntwitched backwards, looking more surprised than when Harry had first\nstartled him.</p>\n<p>\nHarry\ntook a deep breath, \"Yeah to all of it. And I'm really stubborn as well.\"</p>\n<p>\nDraco\nstared at him.</p>\n<p>\nHarry\nsmiled hopefully.</p>\n<p>\nAfter\na drawn out bit of silence, Draco said, \u201cYou\u2019re a\nnutter.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>Maybe\nso,\u201d Harry said, stuffing his hands in his pockets, \u201cSo I\nwas thinking, I could start sharing time.\u201d</span></span></p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>Sharing\ntime?\u201d Draco asked after a pause, still looking at Harry as if\nhe had gone rabid.</span></span></p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>Well,\nthat\u2019s what you called it.\u201d Harry said, slightly\ndefensively, \u201cJust ask me something.\u201d</span></span></p>\n<p>\nDraco\u2019s\neyes narrowed, \u201cWhat sort of something?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>Anything\nyou want?\u201d Harry said trying not to roll his eyes.</span></span></p>\n<p>\nDraco\u2019s\neyes narrowed further and he looked Harry over and then around the\nroom, as if expecting a trap. Once satisfied, he asked, \u201cWhat\nhappened in the forest?\u201d</p>\n<p>\nHarry\ngroaned. Of all the things he had to ask, it would be that.</p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>I\nknew you were full of shit,\u201d Draco said quietly, his voice\nlacking its normal venom.</span></span></p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>That\u2019s\nnot it,\u201d Harry said, pushing his hand through his hair, \u201cOnly\nthree people know what really happened, your mum, Ron and Hermione\nand the last thing I want is it getting out-\u201d he waved a hand\nat the world in general, \u201c-there. It\u2019s bad enough as it\nis with the press and papers and this stupid kiss thing.\u201d</span></span></p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>Aww,\u201d\nDraco said with a melodramatic pout, \u201cPoor Potty, doesn\u2019t\nwant all the world to love and adore him, bowing, grovelling, kissing\nhis feet?\u201d</span></span></p>\n<p>\nHarry\nfrowned at him, \u201cYou\u2019ve got to know I hate it. If you\nknow me at all, you\u2019ve got to know I hate it.\u201d He sat on\nthe risers, his back to Draco, scrubbing his hands over his face, \u201cI\nwas cornered by a group of\u00a0<i>second years</i>\u00a0today.\nTwelve years old. I swear to Merlin they only went up to my waist.\u201d</p>\n<p>\nBehind\nhim, Draco choked a laugh down into a snigger.</p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>Very\nfunny,\u201d Harry muttered.</span></span></p>\n<p>\nDraco\njumped off the table and reluctantly sat on the steps near Harry, \u201cI\nwon\u2019t tell anyone about whatever happened in the forest.\u201d</p>\n<p>\nHarry\nglanced over at him sidelong.</p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>I\nwon\u2019t!\u201d Draco said petulantly.</span></span></p>\n<p>\nHarry\ndraped his hands over his knees and stared at them fixedly, \u201cI\ndied.\u201d He took a shaky breath and quickly added on before Draco\ncould ruin the moment, \u201cI went into the forest and Voldemort\nkilled me with an avada kedavra.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>You\ndon\u2019t look very dead,\u201d Draco said.</span></span></p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>I\ncame back,\u201d Harry smiled faintly, \u201cDecided it wasn\u2019t\nfor me.\u201d</span></span></p>\n<p>\nDraco\ngrinned for a split second before wiping the expression from his\nface, \u201cVery funny, Potter, but that doesn\u2019t make any\nsense. People don\u2019t just\u00a0<i>come back</i>\u00a0from the\nkilling curse.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>Well,\nthere were a lot of factors involved,\u201d Harry said, thinking of\nthe deathly hallows and being a horcrux but it was too soon to share\nthat just yet. \u201cDumbledore always said love was the strongest\nmagic there is. I was going to die to protect them, everyone in the\nschool.\u201d</span></span></p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>Sounds\nlike bullshit\u00a0to me,\u201d Draco said.</span></span></p>\n<p>\nHarry\nshrugged, \u201cAsk your mum then. She was there, she saw me get hit\nby the curse. Voldemort asked her to check I was dead and she lied to\nhim, so she could find you.\u201d He shivered and squeezed his hands\ntogether, \u201cHow about we talk about anything else now. How are\nyou doing on the potions assignment?\u201d</p>\n<p>\nDraco\nstudied him, his shoulders relaxing, \u201cI finished it yesterday.\u201d</p>\n<p>\nHarry\ngrimaced, \u201cAny pointers?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>What\ndo you have so far?\u201d</span></span></p>\n<p>\nHarry\u2019s\ngrimace deepened, \u201cI haven\u2019t started it yet?\u201d</p>\n<p>\nDraco\nclosed his eyes like he was in pain, \u201cIt\u2019s due in\u00a0<i>two\ndays</i>, Potter.\u201d</p>\n<p>\nHarry\nshrugged guiltily, \u201cI finished the Defense paper.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>We\nstill have a week for that!\u201d Draco said in dismay.</span></span></p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>It\nwas more interesting!\u201d Harry said defensively.</span></span></p>\n<p>\nDraco\nrolled his eyes, \u201cFine. Meet me in the library tomorrow after\nclasses and I shall assist you, out of pity, of course.\u201d</p>\n<p>\nHarry\ngrinned, \u201cI\u2019ll see you there.\u201d</p>\n<p><br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p><br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p><br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>Mr\nPotter!\u201d</span></span></p>\n<p>\nPansy\u2019s\nall too chipper voice cut through Harry\u2019s thoughts like a hot\nknife through butter. He stopped and half turned as she raced up with\na cheerful, and terribly fake smile.</p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>Could\nI interview you, Mr Potter?\u201d Pansy asked, \u00a0\u201cYou did\nsay-\u201d she broke off with a meaningful look.</span></span></p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>Can\nyou stop calling me Mr Potter?\u201d Harry asked.</span></span></p>\n<p>\nPansy\nnodded without hesitation, \u201cHarry? Potter? What would you\nprefer?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>Potter,\nI suppose. It\u2019s what I\u2019m used to.\u201d</span></span></p>\n<p>\nPansy\nleaned forwards slightly, \u201cSo? Interview?\u201d</p>\n<p>\nHarry\nsighed, \u201cHow much say do I get about what you write?\u201d</p>\n<p>\nPansy\u2019s\neyes narrowed slightly before she covered up the expression with\nanother cheerfully fake smile, \u201cI\u2019ll give you one veto.\nI\u2019ll let you look at my notes and you can get rid of one thing\nif you like,\u201d she sniffed imperiously, \u201cbut that\u2019s\nonly if this is absolutely exclusive, deal?\u201d</p>\n<p>\nPansy\nraised an eyebrow and extended her hand.</p>\n<p>\nHarry\nhesitated for a second before reaching out to take it, \u201cAlright.\nI\u2019ve got a free period now before my last class so-\u201d</p>\n<p>\nPansy\ncast a tempus charm so quick her wand was only a blurred twitch\nbefore it disappeared u her sleeve again. She glared at the time,\nlatched her hand around Harry\u2019s wrist and dragged him into the\nnearest empty room. The door slammed shut behind them followed by a\nlocking and silencing charm as Pansy sat on top of a desk and pulled\nout a piece of parchment and a peacock quill that had been charmed\npink to float beside her, poised to write.</p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>First\noff, thank you for granting me this interview, Mr Potter,\u201d\nPansy said brightly, her eyes watching the quill to make sure it was\ntranscribing everything before she focused her attention on him.</span></span></p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>Err\u2026\nsure?\u201d Harry said, feeling a little off balance at the sudden\nchange in tone. He leaned against an empty desk, dropping his bag on\nthe ground by his feet.</span></span></p>\n<p>\nPansy\nnodded absently, watching the quill again, \u201cEvery wizard-born\nhas grown up hearing bedtime stories of the story of the Princess and\nthe Priestess but now it\u2019s come to play out right in front of\nus in the life of our own Harry Potter, saviour of the wizarding\nworld.\u201d</p>\n<p>\nHarry\nfrowned at the description.</p>\n<p>\nPansy\nsmiled wickedly at his discomfort but her tone stayed professional,\n\u201cBut this isn\u2019t a fairy story and Harry Potter is just a\nperson.\u201d She paused and cleared her throat as she folded her\nhands neatly together above her knee, \u201cSo, how are you feeling\nsince news of your condition came out?\u201d</p>\n<p>\nHarry\ngave her a funny look, \u201cIt\u2019s not a disease.\u201d</p>\n<p>\nPansy\nfrowned faintly at herself, grabbing the quill and scratching out a\nfew lines. \u201cRight, forget about that.\u201d Her frown furrowed\nfaintly and she hazarded, a great deal more carefully, \u201cWould\nyou say- Would you confirm earlier reports about your inability to\nkiss anyone are true?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>They\nare,\u201d Harry said a little reluctantly.</span></span></p>\n<p>\nPansy\nnodded, \u201cIn the wake of this reporter\u2019s last story, Mr\nPotter has been inundated by those wishing to test their luck.\nDespite Headmistress McGonagall\u2019s best efforts students have\ncontinually attempted to kiss Mr Potter without his consent,\ndisrupting both his life and those of other students.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>Usually-\u201d\nHarry cut in, \u201c-interviews have a lot more questions in them.\u201d</span></span></p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>Oh\nshut up,\u201d Pansy snapped and then grabbed the parchment again\nwith a scowl and scratched that out. \u201cFine. I\u2019ll just ask\na lot of questions then and work out the article later.\u201d</span></span></p>\n<p>\nHarry\nshrugged.</p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>So\nyou can\u2019t kiss anyone. Have you gotten close?\u201d</span></span></p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>Yeah,\u201d\nHarry nodded.</span></span></p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>With\nwho?\u201d Pansy asked, her eyebrows twitching up in interest.</span></span></p>\n<p>\nHarry\nsighed, \u201cGinny Weasley and Dean Thomas came close.\u201d</p>\n<p>\nPansy\ntried to hide her interest by glancing away at the quill as if\nhappily scratched away, \u201cA boy and a girl? Would you be upset\nif your perfect magical match was a bloke?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>Not\nreally.\u201d</span></span></p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>Can\nyou say more than two words at a time, Potter, or is that your limit\nas far as conversation goes?\u201d Pansy said impatiently, snatching\nher quill before it could write any of that down.</span></span></p>\n<p>\nHarry\nsmirked and shrugged nonchalantly.</p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>ugh,\u201d\nPansy groaned under her breath. She closed her eyes briefly,\ngathering herself and fixing her hair absentmindedly. \u201cOkay,\u201d\nshe said levelly, \u201cHow do you feel about students trying to\nkiss you without your permission?\u201d</span></span></p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>I\ndon\u2019t like it,\u201d Harry said, rolling his eyes.</span></span></p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>But\none of those students could be your perfect match, your Priestess,\u201d\nPansy went on.</span></span></p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>I\nthink\u2026\u201d Harry mused, \u201cif it\u2019s like the\nstories and the stronger your magical connection, the more perfect\nyou are for one another. Then, my perfect match would be someone I\u2019m\nat least sorta attracted too right? Not random strangers or students\nI don\u2019t know or little kids.\u201d</span></span></p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>And\nwhat if you never find someone?\u201d Pansy asked her voice\ndropping.</span></span></p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>I-\u201d\nHarry broke off as the thought lodged in his mind like a thorn. A\npart of himself, a very small part he hadn\u2019t wanted to\nacknowledge, wondered that as well and wondered if maybe he had\ndreamed what had happened at the party. He had had a lot to drink. It\nwas late. It had been so brief.</span></span></p>\n<p>\nHe\nchewed on his lip then forced a smile on, \u201cIt\u2019d be nice\nif I did. No one wants to be alone\u2026. If I couldn\u2019t find\nsomeone I suppose I could always marry a muggle.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>A\nmuggle?\u201d Pansy\u2019s nose wrinkled in disgust.</span></span></p>\n<p>\nHarry\nlaughed weakly, \u201cOther than being magicless, they\u2019re the\nsame as us. I\u2019m sure I could find someone smart and clever\u2026\nsarcastic\u2026 sharp,\u201d he smiled faintly. Harry wiped the\nexpression off his face when he realized who he was thinking of, and\njust as promptly the feeling of dread returned. He told himself\nit\u00a0<i>had</i>\u00a0happened, it wasn\u2019t a dream. It had\nbeen real. He was certain. He had to be certain.</p>\n<p>\nHarry\ngrabbed his bag, pulling it over his shoulder, \u201cThat\u2019s\ngood enough right? I need to head to class.\u201d He headed toward\nthe door without waiting for a reply.</p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>Wait!\u201d\nPansy said hastily.</span></span></p>\n<p>\nHarry\nstopped and half turned back towards her.</p>\n<p>\nPansy\nflushed faintly and quickly tucked her hair behind her ears, \u201cYou\u2019ve\nbeen talking with Draco right? You\u2019re going to study in the\nlibrary later?\u201d</p>\n<p>\nHarry\ngave a brief nod.</p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>Just-\nIf you could-\u201d she broke off, bit her lip, glanced away\nawkwardly, \u201c\u2026Don\u2019t hurt him.\u201d</span></span></p>\n<p>\nHarry\u2019s\nbrow furrowed, \u201cHurt him? I won\u2019t-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>Not physically, you brute,\u201d she said impatiently. She went on more carefully,\neach word delicately laid out like the silver cutlery for a ten-course\nmeal, \u201cHe\u2019s- He\u2019s always wanted your attention.\u201d</span></span></p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>Alright,\u201d\nHarry said, not knowing what else to say. He removed the locking\nspell from the door and was about to leave when he remembered, \u201cI\nget one veto, right?\u201d</span></span></p>\n<p>\nHe\nheard Pansy stifle a hissed\u00a0<i>shit</i>\u00a0under her breath.\nHarry let the silence draw out, enjoying the way Pansy\u2019s\nshoulders tensed and drew up around herself.</p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>In\nyour article, refer to me as the Priestess would you, and the other-\nwhoever as the Princess,\u201d Harry said.</span></span></p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>What?\u201d\nPansy said in utter confusion.</span></span></p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>I\njust prefer it, alright?\u201d Harry said. He waited until Pansy\nnodded and then left the room, slowly heading to his last class for\nthe day and imagining Draco in ermine-trimmed robes, crowned in gold.</span></span></p>\n<p><br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p><br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>\nDraco\nhad picked a table near the back corner of the library. His face was\npartially hidden by his fringe as he leaned over a piece of\nparchment. As Harry got closer, he noticed that Draco seemed paler\nthan normal.</p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>You\nalright?\u201d he asked as he pulled out the chair beside Draco.</span></span></p>\n<p>\nThe\nparchment crumpled under Draco\u2019s hand as he reflexively tried\nto hide it. He scowled in recognition, his hand relaxing, \u201cDo\nyou get some sort of perverse enjoyment out of sneaking up behind me,\nPotter?\u201d</p>\n<p>\nHarry\nthought about it for a second, dropping his bag onto the empty chair\nbeside him, \u201cMaybe.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>Maybe?\u201d\nDraco repeated, his voice caught between mocking and bewilderment.</span></span></p>\n<p>\nHarry\nsmiled faintly, \u201cI mean, I could certainly learn to like it\nwell enough.\u201d</p>\n<p>\nDraco\nkicked out at him but only succeeded in hitting the leg of Harry\u2019s\nchair. He flushed faintly either in pain or embarrassment and asked,\n\u201cWhy are you sitting next to me?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>You\nsaid you\u2019d help me on the potions paper?\u201d Harry said.</span></span></p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>That\ndoesn\u2019t mean you need to be right next to me,\u201d Draco said\nstiffly.</span></span></p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>Why?\u201d\nHarry asked, \u201cIs being a prat contagious?\u201d</span></span></p>\n<p>\nDraco\ntook another kick at him and this time managed to connect with\nHarry\u2019s ankle.</p>\n<p>\nHarry\njumped, letting out a hiss of pain.</p>\n<p>\nDraco\nsmirked triumphantly, \u201cIt must be since I caught it from you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\nHarry\nrolled his eyes, \u201cWhat\u2019s this then?\u201d he tapped\nDraco\u2019s wrinkled parchment.</p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>Oh.\u201d\nDraco looked down, smoothing his hands over the parchment, \u201cWell\u2026\u201d\nhe bit his lip briefly in thought, \u201cIt\u2019s a letter, from\nmy Mother.\u201d</span></span></p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>Yeah?\nShe alright?\u201d Harry asked.</span></span></p>\n<p>\nDraco\nsighed, \u201cWhy are you so interested in my Mother, Potter? Quite\nfrankly, it\u2019s a bit unsettling\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>She\nsaved my life,\u201d Harry said with a shrug, \u201cDid you tell\nher I was doing alright? Since she asks after me and all that.\u201d</span></span></p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>I\ntold her no such thing,\u201d Draco said.</span></span></p>\n<p>\nHarry\nfought down a smile, \u201cWhat does it say then? You looked a bit\npale when you were reading it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>Don\u2019t\npretend you care,\u201d Draco said so softly Harry wasn\u2019t sure\nhe was meant to hear it.</span></span></p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>I\u2019d\nlike to- to care,\u201d Harry said, his face feeling warm.</span></span></p>\n<p>\nTwo\nspots of pink bloomed on Draco\u2019s cheeks, \u201cOh shut up,\u201d\nhe muttered, hastily folding up the letter, \u201cI asked my Mother\nabout what you said last night and she-\u201d he took a deep\nbreath,\u201d -she said that you were hit with it, the spell, and\ndoesn\u2019t know how you survived. She thinks a powerful magical\nartefact must have been involved which I am far more inclined to\nbelieve over the power of\u00a0<i>love</i>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\nHarry\nlaughed at his tone, \u201cMy mum\u2019s love saved me the first\ntime, your mum\u2019s love saved me the second- I\u2019m rather\npartial to the power of love myself,\u201d he smiled even wider,\n\u201cconsidering my situation, third time\u2019s the charm,\nright?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>Ugh,\u201d\nDraco said flatly, picking up a book four inches thick and dropping\nit in front of Harry with a thump. He looked slightly more pleased\nwith Harry\u2019s dismayed expression, \u201cThis is the best text\nto reference for the moon and other celestial phase effects upon\ningredients and how they combine.\u201d</span></span></p>\n<p>\nHarry\nslowly lifted the cover, he swore it creaked, and groaned, \u201cIt\u2019s\nonly a foot and a half of parchment, I don\u2019t need\u00a0<i>all</i>\u00a0of\nthis.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>And\nthat is why you\u2019re rubbish at potions,\u201d Draco said with a\nsniff of superiority.</span></span></p>\n<p>\nHarry\nflipped through to the introduction. There was no table of contents\nand the writing- and it was hand written- was tiny and cramped like\nthe author was afraid of wasting parchment. There were very few\nillustrations and they were all very small and crowded like\nbegrudging afterthoughts.</p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>Books\nlike this are why I hate potions,\u201d Harry grumbled.</span></span></p>\n<p>\nWith\na very put upon sigh, Draco grabbed the book back, opening halfway\nand turning the pages until he somehow found the one he was looking\nfor, and pushing it back in front of Harry. \u201cStart here.\u201d</p>\n<p>\nHarry\nsmiled, \u201cThanks.\u201d He didn\u2019t miss how Draco flushed\nfaintly even as he quickly turned his head away.</p>\n<p>Harry\nhad been afraid he\u2019d be too distracted by Draco to get much\ndone on his assignment but he was sorely wrong. Draco was used to\ntutoring the notoriously thick Crabbe and Goyle, he didn\u2019t\ntolerate idle chit-chat, distractions or daydreams. No matter how\nmuch Draco sighed and complained he always made sure Harry was on the\nright track and would explain anything he wasn\u2019t certain about\nin the most succinct way humanly possible, the polar opposite to how\nHermione went about helping. For all that, once dinner got close,\nHarry couldn\u2019t have focused a second longer.</p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>What\nare you working on?\u201d He asked Draco.</span></span></p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>There\u2019s\nstill ten minutes left,\u201d Draco said, not looking up from his\nwriting.</span></span></p>\n<p>\nHarry\nglanced at the massive potions book and flipped it closed, \u201cI\u2019m\nhalfway done.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>Not\nthe point.\u201d</span></span></p>\n<p>\nHarry\nrolled his eyes and leaned in a little closer, \u201cThe point is\nthat I\u2019m done as I\u2019m going to be. Are you working on the\nDefense assignment?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<i><span>I\u2019m</span></i><span><span>\u00a0working\nright now, if you don\u2019t mind,\u201d Draco said coolly.</span></span></p>\n<p>\nHarry\nnarrowed his eyes suspiciously. Draco continued to \u2018work\u2019,\nalthough Harry was fairly certain he was not 'working\u2019 in the\nslightest. Harry waited. When Draco went to dip his quill in the inkwell, Harry snatched the parchment away.</p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>Hey-!\u201d\nDraco grasped after it.</span></span></p>\n<p>\nHarry\nleaned away as far as he could in his chair, reading-\u00a0<i>Dear\nMother, I am speaking with Potter now as you so surmised, but it is\nnothing of any import. I am not entirely certain of his-\u00a0</i>and\nthe letter ended there.</p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>You\nwrite mum a lot, don\u2019t you?\u201d Harry said, putting the\nletter down in front of himself.</span></span></p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>Return\nit please,\u201d Draco said stiffly, his mouth pursed in a thin\nline.</span></span></p>\n<p>\nHarry\ntook his quill, dipping it fastidiously in the ink, \u201cRon hardly\nwrites at all and Hermione only writes once a week. Do you write\nevery day?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>Not\u00a0</span></span><i><span>every</span></i><span><span>\u00a0day!\u201d\nDraco blurted, looking embarrassed and pretending not to be\nembarrassed in the slightest, \u201cShe worries. After everything\nthat happened-\u201d he hesitated, \u201c-She worries is all.\u201d</span></span></p>\n<p>\nHarry\nheld the parchment flat and wrote at the bottom in his neatest\nhandwriting, which meant he had to write quite slowly-\u00a0<i>Mrs\nMalfoy, this is Harry Potter, I\u2019m doing well. Thanks-</i></p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>What\nare you doing!?\u201d Draco sputtered, grabbing for the paper again.</span></span></p>\n<p>\nHarry\nsmacked his hand away, \u201cSaying hi to your mum, since you won\u2019t\ndo it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\n-<i>for\nasking after me and for everything really. I\u2019ve been getting to\nknow Draco, although he\u2019s being very difficult about it. I hope\nyou are doing well. HP-</i></p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>There.\u201d\nHarry smiled at his handy work, grabbing his wand to seal and protect\nhis message before handing it back to Draco.</span></span></p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>I\ncould just tear it off,\u201d Draco muttered, squinting as he read\nwhat Harry wrote, \u201cStart the whole letter over again-\u201d he\nfrowned, \u201c-Merlin, your handwriting is atrocious.\u201d</span></span></p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>It\u2019s\nlegible!\u201d Harry said defensively.</span></span></p>\n<p>\nDraco\nsnorted and rolled his eyes, placed the parchment on the neat pile of\nhis other paper and stacked his books atop that.</p>\n<p>\nHarry\ncast a tempus and saw that dinner had already started, shoving his\nthings haphazardly into his bag.</p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>Do\nyou always make such a mess?\u201d Draco asked. He held his bag open\nand with a quick charm, his neat stack of paper and books, filed\nthemselves into his bag just as neatly.</span></span></p>\n<p>\nHarry\nsighed, \u201cHermione tried to teach me that charm once, never\ncould get the hang of it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>Shocking,\u201d\nDraco muttered sarcastically.</span></span></p>\n<p>\nHarry\nbegan absentmindedly fussing with the chaotic mess of his bag, not\nwanting to leave first.</p>\n<p>\nDraco\nstood, looping his bag over his shoulder. He half turned away, his\nhand still resting on his chair, \u201cI\u2019m not going to go out\ntonight, much as I am loath to disrupt your stalking.\u201d</p>\n<p>\nHarry\ngrinned, \u201cTerribly inconvenient, I\u2019ll have to rearrange\nmy schedule entirely.\u201d</p>\n<p>\nDraco\npaused, his fingers toying absently with the swirls carved into the\nwood on the back of his chair, \u201cI was- Tomorrow night I might\ngo to the pitch.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>Might?\nWhen?\u201d Harry asked.</span></span></p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>You\u2019re\nthe stalker, you figure it out,\u201d Draco said as he quickly\nwalked past Harry and out of the library.</span></span></p>\n<p><br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>Mr\nPotter!\u201d</span></span></p>\n<p>\nHarry\nturned, half expecting to see Pansy before he realized the voice\ndidn\u2019t fit. The girl was wearing Slytherin colours but, best\nguess, she was a fifth or sixth year, with long blond hair rather\nthan Pansy\u2019s short black bob.</p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>Err,\nyeah?\u201d Harry said nervously.</span></span></p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>My\nfriend Ellidh said she kissed you, is it true?\u201d she demanded.</span></span></p>\n<p>\nHarry\nfrowned, \u201cWho-?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>Ellidh\nKeegan!\u201d She shouted, her face taking on a red tinge, \u201cShe\u2019s\na sixth year Ravenclaw with brown curly hair and freckles across her\nnose!\u201d</span></span></p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>Amelia,\nEllidh isn\u2019t the type to do that and you know it,\u201d A tall\nhufflepuff with spiky black hair said as he walked up causally to\njoin his friend.</span></span></p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>Shut\nup, Jeremy!\u201d Amelia said sharply, keeping her glare fixed on\nHarry.</span></span></p>\n<p>\nHarry\nshook his head, \u201cNo, I haven\u2019t kissed her,\u201d he\nsaid, trying to edge around them.</p>\n<p>\nAmelia\nmoved with him, continuing to block his way, \u201cBut you let her\ntry, didn\u2019t you? I\u2019ve heard people talking-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<i><span>No</span></i><span><span>.\u201d\nHarry said with an exasperated sigh, \u201cI haven\u2019t let\nanyone </span></span><i><span>try.</span></i><span><span> I\u2019ve\nbeen jumped and surround and tricked but </span></span><i><span>I</span></i><span><span> had\nnothing to do with it. Let me pass, would you?\u201d</span></span></p>\n<p>\nAmelia\nface grew redder and she snatched the sleeve of his robe to\nkeep him from leaving, \u201c<i>She said-</i>\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>And\nI said </span></span><i><span>No</span></i><span><span>.\u201d\nHarry cut her off, just barely holding onto his temper and not\nwrenching his robe away and shoving past her like he wanted to.</span></span></p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>Come\non, Amelia,\u201d Jeremy said, gently catching her arm, \u201cI\nknow you fancy Ellidh but-\u201d</span></span></p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>I\nDO NOT!\u201d Amelia shouted on the verge of tears as she let go of\nHarry\u2019s robes and ran down the hall, shoving Jeremy as she\nwent.</span></span></p>\n<p>\nHarry\nheaved a sigh and pushed his hand through his hair.</p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>So-\nThe kissing thing is totally off the table?\u201d Jeremy asked,\n\u201cBecause I\u2019ve always thought if I ever were to fancy a\nbloke you\u2019d-\u201d</span></span></p>\n<p>\u201c<i><span>Enough</span></i><span><span>,\nMr Zhao,\u201d Headmistress McGonagall interrupted tersely.</span></span></p>\n<p>\nJeremy\nlooked past Harry\u2019s shoulder, his expression warping with\napprehension.</p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>You\nmust have an assignment you ought to be working on,\u201d McGonagall\nsaid, \u201cGo on. Before I </span></span><i><span>find</span></i><span><span> you\nsomething to better serve your time.\u201d</span></span></p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>Yes,\nHeadmistress!\u201d Jeremy said, backing away and then walking down\nthe hall as quickly as one can without breaking into a run.</span></span></p>\n<p>\nHarry\nwatched him go the whole way, only turning round when the other boy\nwas out of sight. \u201cYou saw that?\u201d he asked.</p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>Yes.\nAll of it in fact,\u201d McGonagall had her hands clasped together\nin front of herself, mouth pursed in a thin line,\n\u201c</span></span><i><span>Jumped</span></i><span><span>, </span></span><i><span>surround</span></i><span><span> and </span></span><i><span>tricked</span></i><span><span>.\nThat is what you said, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d</span></span></p>\n<p>\nHarry\nwinced, \u201cIt\u2019s nothing really-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>I\nbeg to differ,\u201d McGonagall said smoothly. \u201cAre you headed\nto class?\u201d</span></span></p>\n<p>\nHarry\nshook his head.</p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>Come\nalong then,\u201d McGonagall nodded down the hall.</span></span></p>\n<p>\nHarry\nfell into step with her, following her down the hall and up the\nstaircase to her office. As soon as they stepped inside a tray with a\nsmall tea service appeared on her desk with a faint rattle.</p>\n<p>\nMcGonagall\nfilled both cups in quiet silence before taking her seat behind the\ndesk. \u201cTake a seat, Mr Potter, and some tea. I assure you, you\nare not the one in trouble, at least in this instance,\u201d she\nsaid with a fond smile.</p>\n<p>\nHarry\nlowered himself into the chair across from her, putting a splash of\nmilk and sugar before sliding the porcelain cup closer to him, \u201cSo-?\u201d\nhe hazarded.</p>\n<p>\nMcGonagall\nsighed as she leaned back in her chair, \u201cHogwarts does not\nallow love potions, mind control spells or any other method of\ncoercion that removes a person\u2019s ability to consent. The fact\nof the matter is, regardless of the fact that perhaps no one in this\nschool would be able to kiss you, their attempts to do so against\nyour wishes are assault, and I very specifically announced that it\nwouldn\u2019t be allowed or tolerated.\u201d She picked up her\nteacup, balancing the small cup on its saucer with ease, \u201cSo,\nregardless of your wishes on the matter, I must act.\u201d</p>\n<p>\nHarry\ntoyed with the handle of his own teacup, \u201cWhat are you going to\ndo?\u201d</p>\n<p>\nMcGonagall\nfrowned faintly, hiding the expression by taking a sip of tea. \u201c\u2026A\ngreat deal of your life has been decided for you and I would prefer\nto not continue that legacy if possible. That\u2019s why I wanted to\nspeak with you about how you would like to proceed. If you have any\nsort of preference in that matter-?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>And\nyou can\u2019t just pretend you didn\u2019t see anything?\u201d\nHarry asked without much hope.</span></span></p>\n<p>\nMcGonagall\nshook her head, \u201cIt\u2019s not just what happened in the hall\ntoday. I have heard rumours about other incidents and they seem to be\ngrowing in prevalence. I <i>have</i> been ignoring it, I\ncan no longer do so.\u201d</p>\n<p>\nHarry\nscrubbed his hand through his hair in frustration, \u201cWhat are my\noptions then?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>You\ncan provide me with the names of those who have tried to kiss you and\nthey can be punished, lightly of course.-\u201d</span></span></p>\n<p>\nHarry\ngrimaced.</p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>-Or\nI can request the aurors provide you with a guard during the day\nwhich should dissuade further attempts.\u201d McGonagall took out\nher wand, summoning a tin of biscuits. She took a ginger biscuit and\nheld the tin out to him.</span></span></p>\n<p>\nHarry\nwaved it away with a frown, \u201cThat\u2019s it? Those\u2019re my\nchoices?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>Unless\nyou can think of another solution, then yes,\u201d McGonagall said.</span></span></p>\n<p>\nHarry\nchewed on his bottom lip, brow furrowed in thought. McGonagall\nremained quiet, nursing her tea as Harry tried to think.</p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>Could\nwe- I just get it over with all at once?\u201d Harry said absently,\nstill thinking.</span></span></p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>Get\nit over with?\u201d</span></span></p>\n<p>\nHarry\nnodded, \u201cIn the fairy story, everybody lined up and had a go at\nkissing the Princess and the school isn\u2019t very big, it wouldn\u2019t\ntake very long.\u201d He picked up his cup, taking a fortifying gulp\nof tea, \u201cI\u2019m not going to tell on everyone who- I\u2019m\nnot going to do that. And the last thing I want is having an auror\nfollow me around like I can\u2019t defend myself from a bunch of\nkids.\u201d</p>\n<p>\nMcGonagall\nsat her cup down on the desk as she sat forward, \u201cThat would be\nhighly unusual.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>Yeah\nbut-\u201d</span></span></p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>Mr\nPotter,\u201d McGonagall cut him off by holding up her hand, \u201cAllow\nme to finish. While unusual, your suggestion is the better one so\nlong as you\u2019re willing to put up with the burden of it.\u201d</span></span></p>\n<p>\nHarry\nnodded faintly, \u201cI- yeah. It\u2019ll only take an hour or two\nat most and then it\u2019ll be done with.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>Then\nI shall make an announcement tomorrow morning, and the event shall be\nheld that evening. All students shall be allowed to try and kiss you,\npreferably on the cheek-\u201d she said sternly, \u201c- once and\nonly once. If any of them make further attempts after tomorrow, they\nwill be punished.\u201d</span></span></p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>Punished?\u201d\nHarry repeated.</span></span></p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>A\nweek\u2019s detention, I think, and twenty points from their house.\nThat should act as a deterrent,\u201d she said firmly.</span></span></p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>I-\nokay,\u201d Harry said, hesitating and then standing up, \u201cThanks\nfor- for letting me have a say. So-\u201d</span></span></p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>Would\nyou like any more tea?\u201d McGonagall asked.</span></span></p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>No\nthank you.\u201d</span></span></p>\n<p>\nShe\nlifted the tin again, \u201cBiscuit?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>No,\nI really ought to-\u201d Harry nodded towards the door.</span></span></p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>Oh,\ngo on,\u201d McGonagall said with a small teasing smile, \u201cBut\nHarry, if you change your mind before I make the announcement, tell\nme and we\u2019ll find another solution.\u201d</span></span></p>\n<p>\nHarry\ngrinned and nodded, \u201cAlright, thank you, Professor.\u201d</p>\n<p><br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p><br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\n<span>\n<span>That\nnight Harry lay on his bed, watching the maurders map and Draco\u2019s\ndot as he went from the Slytherin common room, where he spent nearly\nan hour with Pansy and Blaise, to his room where he spent nearly\nanother hour before getting up and moving around like he was going to\ngo out, around midnight.</span>\n</span>\n</span>\n</p>\n<p>\nHarry\nhopped off his bed and pulled on his thicker robes for the night\nchill outside. He dug around in his chest grabbing a brick-sized\nwooden box from inside and stuffed it into his robes, almost\nforgetting to drape his invisibility cloak over his shoulders as he\nhurried out. He was hoping to get there first, entirely for Draco\u2019s\nsatisfaction, and felt like a ridiculous sop.</p>\n<p>\nOutside\nthe air was just cold enough to sting on the tips of his ears,\nsmelling damp and sharp in his nose. The castle spilt a faint yellow\nglow against Harry\u2019s back as he made his way across the grounds\nthat faded as he moved farther away, the light becoming a pale\ngrey-white under a clear star-filled sky. Every breath left behind it\na faint cloud in the air, fading before he passed through it.</p>\n<p>\nThestands\nrose up before him silhouetted in darkness. In the centre of the\npitch, a ring of moonlight waited like a spotlight. Harry pulled off\nhis invisibility cloak as he reached the middle, turning his heel and\nfinding no one around. Somewhat belatedly he cast a warming charm\nover himself and a revealing charm to make sure he wouldn\u2019t be\ncaught by Hagrid or another professor. Satisfied he was alone, Harry\npressed his hands into his pockets and craned his head back, looking\nup at the sky\u2019s glittering blanket of stars.</p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>Been\nwaiting long?\u201d Draco said, faintly smug.</span></span></p>\n<p>\nHarry\njumped his heart racing for a split second before he realized who it\nwas. When he turned on his heel towards Draco, he saw a delighted\nsmile dawn across his face.</p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>I\nsuppose I can see the appeal now, when it comes to sneaking up on\npeople,\u201d Draco said still grinning.</span></span></p>\n<p>\nHarry\nhuffed, too pleased to see Draco to be properly annoyed, \u201cYou\nwould.\u201d</p>\n<p>\nDraco\nnarrowed his eyes, \u201cWhat\u2019s that supposed to mean?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>Nothing,\u201d\nHarry shrugged then amended, \u201cThat we\u2019re alike.\u201d</span></span></p>\n<p>\nDraco\nscoffed, \u201cWe\u2019re nothing alike, Potter.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>I\nthink we are,\u201d Harry said, feeling faintly embarrassed by how\nsoft he said it.</span></span></p>\n<p>\nDraco\nbit his lip briefly and then looked up, \u201cI don\u2019t know why\nI invited you. It\u2019s not as if I\u2019ll be able to concentrate\non the stars at all.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>Because\nI\u2019m far too fit?\u201d Harry teased.</span></span></p>\n<p>\nDraco\nrolled his eyes, \u201cToo <i>annoying</i>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>I\u2019m\nnot that bad,\u201d Harry protested.</span></span></p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>So\nyou are at least aware of the fact that you\u2019re annoying in some\ncapacity.\u201d Draco said, \u201cI suppose it\u2019s a start.\u201d</span></span></p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>Hey!\u201d\nHarry bumped Draco shoulder making him stumble.</span></span></p>\n<p>\nDraco\nshot Harry a glare as he straightened his robes with a huff.</p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>All\nthe times I\u2019ve interrupted you, you were looking at the stars?\u201d\nHarry asked.</span></span></p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>What\nan astute observation,\u201d Draco said sarcastically.</span></span></p>\n<p>\nHarry\nsighed and looked up again, \u201cI can see why, they\u2019re\nbeautiful.\u201d</p>\n<p>\nDraco\nshifted his weight uneasily beside Harry, stuffing his hands into his\nrobe, \u201cWhen I can\u2019t sleep, it helps- looking at them.\u201d</p>\n<p>\nHarry\nnodded with a faint smile as he traced the path of the milky-way\nacross the sky. He ran his fingers along the edge of the box in his\npocket and took a deep breath, plucking up his courage.</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201c<span><span>Here,\u201d\nHarry said, pulling the box out and offering it to Draco before he\ncould change his mind.</span></span></span>\n</p>\n<p>\nDraco\ntook it hesitantly, holding it so delicately he looked about to drop\nit, \u201cA snitch box?\u201d his brow furrowed, \u201cIt\u2019s\nfar too dark and cold for a seekers game right now.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>Another\ntime then?\u201d Harry asked hopefully. Realizing he was getting off\ntopic he pointed to the box, \u201cJust open it.\u201d</span></span></p>\n<p>\nDraco\ncarefully flicked open the little latch and opened the lid. The\nsnitch inside was silvery-blue rather than the standard gold.</p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>It\u2019s\na snitch,\u201d Draco said flatly, raising an eyebrow.</span></span></p>\n<p>\nHarry\nbounced on his toes, \u201cLet it go.\u201d</p>\n<p>\nDraco\nplaced his hand over the little quivering ball, \u201cDo you have a\nretrieval ring? Because if this is just an elaborate hoax to get me\nto play a seekers game you can retrieve it yourself.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>I\nmodified it to return on a command word,\u201d Harry said, gently\nnudging Draco\u2019s arm.</span></span></p>\n<p>\nDraco\nshot him another distrustful glance, \u201cSo you broke it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>Only\na little,\u201d Harry said with a hesitant smile.</span></span></p>\n<p>\nDraco\nshrugged slightly, taking the snitch from the box. Its wings hummed\nto life and it quickly rose from the box, flitting a few feet away\nfrom them. It glowed in the darkness, every darting movement left a\nribbon-like trail of light, flecks of it falling free like drifting\nembers before slowly fading away.</p>\n<p>\nHarry\nglanced over at Draco hopeful and nervous.</p>\n<p>\nDraco\nwas watching the snitch intently, his expression unreadable, \u201cIt\u2019s\nlovely.\u201d</p>\n<p>\nHarry\nbreathed out, \u201cYou like it then?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>I\nalready said, didn\u2019t I?\u201d Draco said, tugging his scarf up\nover his mouth.</span></span></p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>I\nwasn\u2019t sure you would.\u201d</span></span></p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>It\u2019s\nvery clever charm work,\u201d Draco glanced down at his feet then at\nthe box in his hands before offering it over to Harry, \u201cCall it\nback then.\u201d</span></span></p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>I\nwrote the command words on a bit of parchment inside,\u201d Harry\nsaid, pointing to the little scrap sticking up from where the snitch\nhad laid, \u201cTo call it back and you can increase or decrease its\nrange from the box, it\u2019s um- tied to the box as its center. I\ncouldn\u2019t think of a better way to do it.\u201d</span></span></p>\n<p>\nDraco\nstared at him, his brow twitching together in confusion.</p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>Oh,\u201d\nHarry said faintly, his cheeks heating up, \u201cIt\u2019s for\nyou.\u201d He glanced at the snitch, \u201cI made it for you.\u201d</span></span></p>\n<p>\nDraco\u2019s\neyes widened and his cheeks went red all at once. He quickly turned\naway, tucking his chin into his scarf to hide his face as he fumbled\nout the parchment, turning it towards the sky to catch enough light\nto read the carefully penned words, \u201c<i>conciliatio</i>,\u201d\nhe said quietly.</p>\n<p>\nThe\nsnitch diverted from its flight path and zipped back into the box,\nsettling itself into the plush velvet. Draco carefully placed the\nparchment back inside and latched the box shut with a faint click,\n\u201cThank you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2026<span><span>I-\nwell, I\u2019m glad you liked it,\u201d Harry scuffed the toe of\nhis shoe in the grass. He needed to tell Draco about tomorrow night\nfiasco. He took a deep breath.</span></span></p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>I\nread Pansy\u2019s article,\u201d Draco held the box tightly in both\nhands, pulling it close to his chest.</span></span></p>\n<p>\nHarry\u2019s\nbrow furrowed, \u201cHer article?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>You\nwould really marry a muggle if you couldn\u2019t-?\u201d Draco\nturned to him, pinning him with eyes the colour of slate, \u201cYou\u2019d\ngive up?\u201d</span></span></p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>What?\u201d\nHarry said, feeling utterly dumbfounded, \u201cIt was just- it was\nsomething to say. I don\u2019t think that-\u201d</span></span></p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>I\nmean, it\u2019s not important,\u201d Draco interrupted, sounding a\nlittle frantic, \u201ckissing and physical intimacy- If\nyou </span></span><i><span>care</span></i><span><span> about\nsomeone you-\u201d his voice caught, \u201c\u2026if you really\ncare about someone.\u201d</span></span></p>\n<p>\nHarry\nshook his head, \u201cBut at the party-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>I\ndon\u2019t care about the party! The party was a mistake!\u201d\nDraco snapped, squeezing the box in his hands so tightly his knuckles\npaled.</span></span></p>\n<p>\nHarry\ntwitched backwards as if Draco had slapped him, \u201cA <i>mistake</i>?\nWhat do you mean?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>What\ndo </span></span><i><span>you</span></i><span><span> mean,\nPotter!?\u201d Draco said, \u201cYou chat me up, flirting- You act\nlike you\u2019re courting me but-\u201d he stopped abruptly, taking\na step back. \u201cI don\u2019t understand your intentions. Not\nwhen I can\u2019t give you what you want.\u201d</span></span></p>\n<p>\nHarry\nopened his mouth but nothing came out.</p>\n<p>\nDraco\ntook another step backwards, his jaw clenching.</p>\n<p>\nHarry\nshook his head, he took a hesitant step forward trying to bridge the\ndistance between them, \u201cI don\u2019t-\u201d</p>\n<p>\nBut\nbefore he could even finish the sentence Draco had turned and ran,\ndisappearing into the shadows of the stands and then truly\ndisappearing under a disillusionment spell.</p>\n<p>\nHarry\nshivered and pulled his cloak tighter around himself, \u201cI don\u2019t\nunderstand.\u201d</p>\n<p><br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p><br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>The\ndorm was entirely silent when he returned and Harry didn\u2019t have\nthe energy to consider waking his friends. He felt bone tired but\ncouldn\u2019t sleep, spending hours staring at the dark hangings of\nhis bed. His mind kept going round and round in endless loops that\nonly seemed more tangled and convoluted the more he thought about\nthem.</p>\n<p>\nHe\ndidn\u2019t wake when the dorm did, or when the alarm he set went\noff the first time, or second, or third. He dragged himself up at the\nfourth, saw how late it was and threw some clothes on, doing only the\nbare minimum to get ready before rushing down to the great hall in\nhope of getting something to eat before breakfast was over. Harry ran\ninto Ron and Hermione coming out of the great hall just as he was\nabout to go in.</p>\n<p>\nRon\nthrew one arm over Harry\u2019s shoulders and dragged Harry along\nwith them. Ron\u2019s other hand held a bacon sandwich which he\npushed at Harry. \u201cSo what was all that then?\u201d Ron asked,\nnodded back towards the hall.</p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>Mph?\u201d\nHarry muttered around a bite of sandwich.</span></span></p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>The\nannouncement, mate,\u201d Ron said impatiently, tugging Harry a\nlittle closer, \u201cWe let you sleep in, seeing as you got in late,\nthinking things were going well and then this whole thing-\u201d</span></span></p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>You\u2019re\nreally going to let the whole school kiss you?\u201d Hermione picked\nup the thread of conversation, \u201cI can\u2019t imagine Malfoy\ntaking it well, did he? I thought things between the two of you were\nimproving.\u201d</span></span></p>\n<p>\nHarry\nsighed, swallowed down a lump of suddenly very dry toast and told\nthem, \u201cI was going to tell him. Everything went tits up before\nI had the chance.\u201d</p>\n<p>\nRon\npulled Harry to a stop.</p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>What\nhappened?\u201d Hermione asked quietly, coming around in front of\nHarry, touching his arm lightly.</span></span></p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>I\ndon\u2019t know.\u201d Harry shook his head, \u201cI don\u2019t\nget it myself.\u201d</span></span></p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>Tell\nus then,\u201d Ron said.</span></span></p>\n<p>\nHarry\nhesitated.</p>\n<p>\nHermione\nsaid, \u201cWe\u2019ve helped before. Maybe we can see something\nyou missed.\u201d</p>\n<p>\nHarry\nnodded, more to convince himself than anything. He closed his eyes,\ntelling them everything he could remember, especially what happened\nat the end when Harry had lost the plot entirely.</p>\n<p>\nBoth\nhis friends were frowning in confusion when he looked at them. Harry\nsighed again, pushing his hand through his hair.</p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>I\nthink you\u2019d better just ask him,\u201d Ron said with a shrug.</span></span></p>\n<p>\nHermione\u2019s\nfrown deepened.</p>\n<p>\nHigh\nup in the castle the massive bronze bell sounded the hour.</p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>I\u2019m\ngoing to class,\u201d Harry said flatly, pulling away from them and\nheading for Charms, forcing himself to eat a few more bites of a\ntasteless sandwich before he threw the rest away.</span></span></p>\n<p>\nDraco\nnever came to class.</p>\n<p><br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p><br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>\nHarry\ntook about three sentences worth of notes during both his classes,\nnone of which he remembered writing down. He dumped everything\nhaphazardly back into his bag, still trying to shove it all inside in\na single crumpled mess when he felt a hand grab him by the arm and\nbegin towing him down the hallway.</p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>H-Hermione?\u201d\nHarry said to the back of the fluffy brown hair.</span></span></p>\n<p>\nShe\nglanced back at him, her grip never loosening, \u201cHurry up.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>Shouldn\u2019t\nyou have been in class?\u201d Harry asked, trying to keep up and\nkeep everything in his bag at the same time.</span></span></p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>Runes,\u201d\nShe said shortly, \u201cI finished early and asked to be excused.\nWas Malfoy in Charms with you?\u201d</span></span></p>\n<p>\nHarry\nshook his head and added since she couldn\u2019t see, \u201cNo, he\nwasn\u2019t-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>He\ndidn\u2019t come to Runes either.\u201d She stopped in front of the\ngargoyle heading up to the Headmistress office, quickly murmuring the\npassword and pulling Harry up the stairs as soon as it had moved.</span></span></p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>What\nare we-?\u201d Harry pulled back.</span></span></p>\n<p>\nHermione\ntightened her grip, \u201cCome on, We don\u2019t have a lot of\nspare time.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>What\nare you doing?\u201d Harry asked, \u201cDoes McGonagall know we\u2019re\ncoming up here?\u201d</span></span></p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>Of\ncourse, I asked for permission to use the school\u2019s pensive and\nshe said I could during lunch,\u201d Hermione said. She cut a\nstraight line\u00a0through the Headmistress\u2019 office to the\ncabinet in the back containing the school\u2019s pensive.</span></span></p>\n<p>\nHarry\npulled free from Hermione\u2019s loosened grip, \u201cWhy?\u201d\nhe asked uneasily.</p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>What\nhappened with Malfoy- It\u2019s been bothering me. There\u2019s too\nmuch that doesn\u2019t make sense.\u201d Hermione said opening the\ncabinet and exposing the heavy stone basin, \u201cI\u2019d like to\nsee it for myself.\u201d She took in his expression and softened,\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to show me anything you don\u2019t want\nto. Just the confusing part.\u201d</span></span></p>\n<p>\nHarry\nfrown faintly.</p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>I\nwant to help,\u201d Hermione said.</span></span></p>\n<p>\nHarry\nlooked down at his feet. He nodded after a moment, \u201cIt might\nhelp if I see it again too.\u201d</p>\n<p>\nHermione\nstepped to the side so Harry could stand in front of the pensive.</p>\n<p>\nHe\ntook a deep breath, pressing his wand to his temple and recalling\neverything after the snitch with as much detail as he could muster. A\nlong silver strand came away with his wand and pooled in the bottom\nof the stone bowl like liquid mercury.</p>\n<p>\nHermione\npressed close to his shoulder, \u201cYou\u2019re sure?\u201d she\nasked.</p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>Yeah,\u201d\nHarry said faintly and leaned forward into the memory. Hermione came\nonly a second behind.</span></span></p>\n<p>\nHarry\nwatched it play out all over again, and then again- it all happened\nso fast- before he couldn\u2019t stand it anymore and pulled himself\nout, feeling as hollow and empty as the when it had first happened.\nHe dropped himself in one of McGonagall\u2019s chair, closing his\neyes and pressing his thumbs into his temples where a dull ache\npromised a future headache.</p>\n<p>\nHermione\u2019s\nfeet shuffled against the carpet as she slowly raised her head,\nblinking rapidly. She plucked the memory out with the tip of her wand\nand walked over to Harry. He dropped his hands, tilting his head and\nfeeling more than seeing when the memory came back to him, fresh and\nsharp once more.</p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>I\nwant to see the party,\u201d Hermione said.</span></span></p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>Wha-?\u201d\nHarry looked up at her, \u201cAll of it? We don\u2019t have time.\u201d</span></span></p>\n<p>\nShe\nrolled her eyes, \u201cJust the part with Malfoy in it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\nHarry\nslumped back into the chair, putting his wand to his temple, \u201cYeah,\nalright,\u201d he said tiredly, pulling the memory from his mind and\nholding his wand out.</p>\n<p>\nHermione\nshook her head at him, carefully taking Harry\u2019s wand and\nputting the memory into the pensive. She tossed his wand back to him,\n\u201cWe\u2019ll need at least twenty minutes to eat lunch, cast a\ntempus and pull me out by then, would you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\nHarry\nwaved at her halfheartedly, casting the tempus after she had already\ngone into the memory. He slumped further down into the chair to stare\nup at it and watch the minutes slowly tick by.</p>\n<p>\nTrue\nto her word, Hermione stayed in the memory until twenty till and\nHarry took her by the shoulder, tugging her backwards until her eyes\nfocused.</p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>Lunch,\u201d\nHarry said, taking the memory back out of the pensive. \u201cFigure\nit out?\u201d he asked.</span></span></p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>Mmm,\u201d\nHermione murmured, her expression distant like it always was when she\nwas trying to figure out a particularly tricky puzzle.</span></span></p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>I\u2019ll\ntake that as a no,\u201d Harry muttered, grabbing his bag off the\nchair and heading downstairs first to pick through whatever was left\nof the lunchtime offerings.</span></span></p>\n<p><br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p><br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>We\nshall see it through as efficiently as possible,\u201d McGonagall\nsaid primly as they walked down the hallway towards the great hall.</span></span></p>\n<p>\nHarry\nstretched his legs slightly to keep up with McGonagall\u2019s\nimpatient clipped pace, \u201cYou\u2019re going to be there?\u201d\nhe asked.</p>\n<p>\nMcGonagall\nnodded, \u201cOf course. You are my student as well as those who\nwish to-\u201d she tsked faintly under her breath, \u201c-tempt\nfate, as it were. It\u2019s my duty to make certain things operate\nin the most efficient and ethical manner possible.\u201d</p>\n<p>\nHarry\nrelaxed slightly, at least there would be no diving tackles or\nkissing his feet if the Headmistress herself was there.</p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>The\noptimum solution would have been if your fellow students could\ncontrol themselves and not act like a great many cats in heat,\u201d\nMcGonagall\u2019s expression soured, \u201cUnfortunately, having\ntaught for a great many years, I know such a thing to be utterly\nimpossible.\u201d</span></span></p>\n<p>\nHarry\nsmiled faintly, \u201cI think you might have better luck with cats,\nProfessor.\u201d</p>\n<p>\nMcGonagall\u2019s\nmouth turned up in a faint knowing smirk, \u201cThat shows what you\nknow about cats, Mr Potter.\u201d</p>\n<p>\nHarry\nspotted Hermione standing by the entrance to the great hall and\nraised his hand to wave, \u201cHerm-\u201d</p>\n<p>\nHe\nwas engulfed in a fluff of brown hair, Hermione clutching the front\nof his jumper to stay upright even as they half spun round from the\nforce of the collision, \u201cHarry! Harry listen-!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<i><span>Ms\nGranger</span></i><span><span>,\u201d\nMcGonagall said, \u201c</span></span><i><span>What</span></i><span><span>\u00a0are\nyou doing?\u201d</span></span></p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>Professor\nI just need to talk to Harry for ten-no-five- just five minutes it\u2019s\nvery important!\u201d Hermione said all in one breath.</span></span></p>\n<p>\nMcGonagall\nnarrowed her eyes slightly before begrudging them a nod, \u201cVery\nwell, five minutes.\u201d</p>\n<p>\nThey\nboth watched for a breathless moment until McGonagall had entered the\ngreat hall.</p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>Hermione,\nwhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Harry asked.</span></span></p>\n<p>\nHermione\nloosened one hand out of his jumper to take out her wand and cast a\nmuffalito around them.</p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>Hermione-\u201d</span></span></p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>What\nif he doesn\u2019t remember?\u201d Hermione said.</span></span></p>\n<p>\nHarry\u2019s\nbrow furrowed, \u201cWhat?\u201d</p>\n<p>\nHermione\u2019s\nhand tightening its grip like she was on the verge of shaking him out\nof frustration,\u201cWhat if Malfoy doesn\u2019t remember the kiss\nat all?

Malfoy would be\nbetter but he\u2019s probably sulking in his room if I were to\nguess. I was just waiting for you to go get her.\u201d</p>\n<p>\nHarry\nfollowed, caught up in Hermione\u2019s urgency, only to nearly run\ninto her back when she suddenly stopped.</p>\n<p>\nHermione\nfrowned at him and shook her head, \u201cWait here, I\u2019ll be\nright back.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>I\nonly have five minutes-\u201d Harry tried to call after her but\nHermione had already gone into the great hall that, if the noise\ncoming from inside was any indication, was packed full.</span></span></p>\n<p> Harry leaned back\nagainst the wall, absentmindedly chewing the edge of his thumb as he\nthought. Was Draco <i>that</i> drunk? Was he the type to drink so much\nhe forgot things? What if it were true? If he didn't remember...\nthen, maybe-</p>\n<p> \u201c-iously\nGranger, this had better be good because the Prophet will absolutely\nbe shitting themselves for this exsclus-Potter!\u201d Pansy\nplastered on a blindingly false smile, \u201cDid you want to talk to\nme?\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cWe did,\u201d\nHermione said, herding the two of them a bit away from the door and\nrecasting her muffling spell, throwing a few other privacy spells on\ntop.</p>\n<p> Pansy glanced\naround suspiciously, \u201cWhat is this about?\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cDid Draco\nremember what happened at the eighth year party?\u201d Harry asked.</p>\n<p> Pansy shrugged one\nshoulder, \u201cMost of it. Up until you said you were going to kiss\nthe whole room and he tried to finish off a whole bottle of fire\nwhiskey himself.\u201d She gave Harry a pointed look.</p>\n<p> \u201cSo he\ndoesn't remember,\u201d Hermione said, she took a step closer to\nPansy, \u201cAnd when he kissed Harry did you see it?\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cWhat?\u201d\nPansy snorted, \u201cI interviewed everyone. No one kissed the boy\nwonder-\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cSo you\ndidn't see,\u201d Harry said, feeling mildly lightheaded.</p>\n<p> Hermione caught\nhis eye and raised her eyebrows.</p>\n<p> Pansy looked from\nHarry to Hermione, \u201cDraco didn't kiss-\u201d she frowned, her\nbrow furrowing in thought. Pansy shook her head, \u201cHe\ncouldn't-?\u201d she studied both their faces and then froze. Her\neyes went wide, \u201cHe <i>did</i>-?\u201d as her hand went up to\nher mouth, pressing over her lips, tears welling in her eyes.</p>\n<p> \u201cAre you\nalright?\u201d Harry asked a bit nervously.</p>\n<p> A giggle escaped\nher and Pansy pressed her head and palm into her shoulder. She looked\nback at them with an ecstatic smile, \u201cI can't <i>fucking</i>\nbelieve it,\u201d she said faintly, \u201cYou're serious? You <i>did</i>\nkiss him? You really did?\u201d</p>\n<p> Harry nodded.</p>\n<p> \u201c<i>Now</i>\nit all makes sense,\u201d Pansy let out a breath, turning half-away\nand wiping the corners of her eyes. She lifted her chin with a deep\nbreath, turned to face Harry and said, \u201cOkay. So I'll do my\nbest to actually try and like you-\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cSame?\u201d\nHarry said faintly.</p>\n<p> \u201c-and if you\never hurt him I'll kill you.\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cI-\u201d\nHarry opened his mouth then closed it and looked over at Hermione\nimploringly.</p>\n<p> Hermione rolled\nher eyes, \u201c<i>Really</i>? I can't imagine them not fighting.\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cYou know\nwhat I mean,\u201d Pansy said sharply.</p>\n<p> \u201cI won't- I-\nI'll try not to,\u201d Harry stammered.</p>\n<p> Pansy tossed her\nhead so her hair bounced against her cheeks, \u201cWell, that will\nhave to do for now. But that's not what's important-\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cNot\n<i>important</i>?\u201d Hermione bristled.</p>\n<p> \u201c<i>Not</i>\nimportant,\u201d Pansy turned and jabbed a finger at Hermione,\n\u201cWhat's <i>important</i> is that Draco doesn't know and he\nneeds to know.\u201d</p>\n<p> Harry took a step\nbackwards.</p>\n<p> Hermione frowned,\n\u201cRight <i>now</i>? Now, Harry has to go to the great hall-\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201c<i>Exactly</i>.\u201d\nPansy interrupted sharply, \u201cNow is the perfect time, can you\njust imagine how it will look-?\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cYou are <i>not</i>\ngoing to get your silly newspaper job involved in this!\u201d\nHermione stepped closer, \u201cDraco is your friend-\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cI can be a\nfriend and get an amazing story! You goody-goody Gryffindor's are\nso-\u201d</p>\n<p> Harry backed\nfurther away and the growing hostility suddenly turned into a buzz of\nindistinct noise. Harry sighed in relief and a little guilty about\nit, but only a little.</p>\n<p> He looked down the\nhallway towards the dungeons; the whole great hall could stuff it,\nhe-</p>\n<p> \u201cHARRY!\u201d\nGinny's voice washed over him.</p>\n<p> Harry turned as\nGinny skipped over to him with a huge grin, Luna a few steps behind.</p>\n<p> \u201cYou've been\nsummoned, my liege,\u201d Ginny said, affecting a ridiculous and\nextravagant bow.</p>\n<p> Luna giggled and\ncopied her, bowing too deeply so her hair fell over her face when she\nstood back up.</p>\n<p> \u201cWhat are\nyou doing here?\u201d Harry asked.</p>\n<p> \u201cHelping,\u201d\nLuna said brightly, absently pushing her hair back one errant lock at\na time.</p>\n<p> \u201cYeah,\nhelping,\u201d Ginny echoed a bit too cheerfully.</p>\n<p> Harry's eyes\nnarrowed, \u201cHelping how?\u201d</p>\n<p> Ginny waved off\nhis concerns, \u201cYou'll see.\u201d She turned and took what\nlooked like a red blanket from Luna. When she unfurled it, holding it\nup and out, Harry could see it was a red velvet cloak trimmed with\nblack and white ermine.</p>\n<p> \u201cNo,\u201d\nHarry said immediately.</p>\n<p> \u201cCome on,\nit'll be fun,\u201d Ginny said. She took out her wand and with a\nflick the offending garment curled around his shoulders.</p>\n<p> Harry grabbed at\nwhere it had attached to his shoulder to pull it off, \u201cI said\nno. This is embarrassing enough as it is.\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cYou owe\nme,\u201d Ginny said, her voice just a little too flat and serious.\n</p>\n<p> Harry looked at\nher imploringly, \u201cCome on, Gin. You can't make me go in there\nlike this.\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cNo, I can't\nmake you,\u201d Ginny said in the same tone.</p>\n<p> Harry stared at\nher, hoping for some sort of reprieve but none came. He wasn't going\nto outright refuse her and Ginny knew it. Harry groaned, his\nshoulders slumping.</p>\n<p> Ginny smiled, \u201cI\ntransfigured it myself from a sheet. I could change the rest of your\nclothes too-\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cAbsolutely\nnot,\u201d Harry said firmly. There were <i>some</i> limits to how\nmuch public humiliation he was willing to endure.\n</p>\n<p> \u201cA jumper\nand school slacks aren't very royal in the least,\u201d Ginny said\nwith a frown.</p>\n<p> Harry rolled his\neyes, \u201cWell that works out fantastic since I'm not bloody\nroyalty.\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cTa-Dah!\u201d\nLuna said, bouncing forward and pulling a silver crown from her\nlittle shoulder bag with a flourish.</p>\n<p> \u201cIt's\n<i>wonderful</i>, Luna!\u201d Ginny said with a little gasp,\n\u201cWhere'd you get it?\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cI conjured\nit,\u201d Luna said primly, reaching up to balance it atop Harry's\nhead.</p>\n<p> The crown stayed\nin place for maybe all of five seconds before sliding off Harry's\nunruly hair. Harry caught it on instinct before it hit the floor,\ntaking a moment to look at it more closely. It didn't look anything\nlike the muggle royal crowns and did look a great deal like something\nout of a fairy story, all silver and delicate curving points\ndecorated with what looked like pearls and diamonds.</p>\n<p> Ginny took it away\nfrom him, holding it protectively, \u201cThis is amazing, Luna.\nYou're going to pass your NEWTs with flying colours.\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cThank you,\u201d\nLuna said absentmindedly, looking through her bag, \u201cI'm quite\ncertain I have some bobby pins.\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cWe could\njust use a sticking spell,\u201d Ginny suggested.</p>\n<p> Luna frowned\nslightly, \u201cI don't think Harry would like that.\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cHarry would\nnot like that,\u201d Harry said flatly.</p>\n<p> \u201cI'll just\nhave to conjure some, I suppose,\u201d Luna dropping her bag back\ndown by her side.</p>\n<p>\n<span><span> Ginny\nshrugged, \u201cWe'll figure it out inside. Come on, before\nMcGonagall comes after us.\u201d She grabbed Harry by the elbow and\ncollected Luna with her other hand when she passed her, pulling them\nboth into the great hall with her.</span></span></p>\n<p><br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p><br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>The\nstudents in the hall gave a great cheer when Harry came in.</p>\n<p>\nHarry\ndid his best not to groan when he saw that he was going to sitting on\nthe rather regal looking Headmistress\u2019 chair; moved in front of\nthe teacher\u2019s table at the edge of the risers. As soon as he\nwas sat Luna was back to putting the crown on his head, with four\nbobby pins of varying colours held in her mouth.</p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>This\nis ridiculous,\u201d Harry muttered.</span></span></p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>Perhaps,\u201d\nMcGonagall said as she stood next to him. She raised her hand and\nroom went mostly quiet aside from a few hushed whispers. \u201cThere\nare rules-\u201d she said loudly, pausing briefly for the groans of\ndismay to pass, her mouth pressed in a tight smile entirely lacking\nin amusement. \u201cYou will form a single queue down the centre,\u201d\nshe drew an invisible line down the middle of the hall between the\nHufflepuff and Ravenclaw tables. McGonagall had to pause again as the\nhall lurched in one great clattering mass towards the centre of the\nroom like a contracting amoeba.</span></span></p>\n<p>\nHarry\nbreathed out a silent sigh, trying not to roll his eyes. He heard a\nsimilar exhalation from above him and glanced up, sharing a brief\nlook with the Headmistress.</p>\n<p>\nMcGonagall\nclapped her hands, the sound unnaturally loud and bringing with it\nthe silence of growing anticipation, \u201cNext, you shall approach\nMr Potter one at a time at which point you shall be allowed, to\nattempt-\u201d she took a bracing breath, utterly seeded with\ndistaste at the entire idea, \u201cto kiss his cheek.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>His\u00a0</span></span><i><span>CHEEK</span></i><span><span>?!\u201d\nA single anguished cry arose above the general shouts of dismay. And\nthrough that noise, a very familiar laugh.</span></span></p>\n<p>\nHarry\nscanned the room and quickly spotted the mop of red hair sitting at\nthe end of the Gryffindor table, Ron was laughing so hard he had to hold onto the table to keep himself up..</p>\n<p>\nHarry\npulled his wand out of his sleeve and hit Ron with a stinging hex,\ncutting the laugh short with a yelp of pain. Ron glared at him and\nHarry gave him a pointed look back.</p>\n<p>\nMcGonagall\npointedly cleared her throat at him.</p>\n<p>\nHarry\nmuttered, \u201cI wanted to give him the two-finger salute,\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>You\nare commended for your restraint,\u201d McGonagall said with\namusement.</span></span></p>\n<p>\nThere\nwas a slight tug on Harry\u2019s hair and he glanced up, watching\nLuna carefully placed another bobby pin. She still had four pins held\nin her mouth, although these ones were all pastel coloured.</p>\n<p>\nMcGonagall\ndidn\u2019t wait for the hall to quiet on its own this time, drawing\na sharp line over the crowd with her wand that culled all the sound\nin front of her, peoples mouths still moving in silence. \u201c<i>Thank\nyou.</i>\u00a0If anyone attempts anything beyond a kiss on the cheek\nwithout Mr Potter\u2019s express consent on the matter, they will be\ngiven a week's detention and lose twenty house points, this extends\nfrom this point on through the remaining school year.\u201d She\npaused, sweeping over the assembled crowd to drive home her point\nbefore continuing, \u201cOnce you have attempted a kiss, you will\nmove to the side here when Ms Weasley will stamp the back of your\nhand.\u201d</p>\n<p>\nGinny\nheld up a large circular stamp the size of a galleon, dark purple\nwith ink.</p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>This\nstamp shows that you have participated already and are not to get\nback in line for another try. The stamp ink is tied to Mr Potter\u2019s\nmagical signature so should you attempt another kiss\u00a0</span></span><i><span>all</span></i><span><span>\u00a0of\nyour skin will be coloured purple for quite a long time,\u201d\nMcGonagall finished and ended the silencing spell.</span></span></p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>What\nif we bump into him by accident!\u201d someone shouted.</span></span></p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>Mr\nPotter will certainly testify to such an\u00a0</span></span><i><span>accident</span></i><span><span>\u00a0and\nthe ink will be removed at speed,\u201d McGonagall said.</span></span></p>\n<p>\nThere\nwas a derisive snort and someone else muttered just loud enough to be\nheard, \u201cThis is bullshite.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>Then\nLEAVE!\u201d Ginny snapped, \u201cHe\u2019s not a fucking prize,\nhe\u2019s a person you ungrateful fu-\u201d</span></span></p>\n<p>\u201c<i><span>Ms\nWeasley</span></i><span><span>,\u201d\nMcGonagall cut her off sharply.</span></span></p>\n<p>\nGinny\nstepped back, \u201cSorry. For swearing, not for what I said.\u201d</p>\n<p>\nMcGonagall\nnodded in apparent acceptance.</p>\n<p>\nPansy\nrushed into the room, shoving through the line of people to the other\nside where she grabbed hold of Blaise by the front of his robes and\nhauled him to his feet, \u201cCome on. I need you to do something.\u201d</p>\n<p>\nHermione\nhad been only a few seconds behind but was held up by trying to slip\nthrough the line politely, \u201cParkinson! We\u2019re not done\ntalking about this!\u201d</p>\n<p>\nPansy\nlet out a bark of a laugh, shoving back through higher up the line by\nthe time Hermione had managed to finally get through, \u201cI think\nwe are, actually!\u201d</p>\n<p>\nHermione\nspun round, pushing her way through without any of the politeness\nthis time, \u201cWe\u2019re\u00a0<i>NOT</i>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>Is\nthere a problem here?\u201d McGonagall asked them.</span></span></p>\n<p>\u201c<span><span>It\u2019s\nfine-\u201d\u201cEverything\u2019s fine-\u201d They both said,\nalready out the door.</span></span></p>\n<p>\nRon looked after them, gave Harry an apologetic shrug, and followed Hermione out the door.</p>\n<p>\nThe\ngreat hall was uncomfortably quiet in the aftermath.</p>\n<p>\nMcGonagall\ngestured at the front of the line impatiently, \u00a0\u201cCome on then, I haven\u2019t\ngot all night.\u201d</p>\n<p><br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>Harry fought down a yawn.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat was the last one,\u201d Luna said quietly right by\nHarry\u2019s ear.</p>\n<p>Harry jumped, picking his head up from where had he propped it on\nhis hand and looking out at the Great Hall. The line was gone.</p>\n<p>Luna gave him a smile and bounced down the risers, heading over to\nthe Gryffindor table where Ginny was helping herself to a cup of tea\nand a few biscuits. The house elves must have brought them because\nthere were tea services on every table along with trays of fresh\nbiscuits. Great gobs of students still filled the room, eating and\ngossiping about who knows what. McGonagall had moved off to a far\nedge of the room, lecturing a pair of third years. At least for the\nmoment, it seemed like Harry was being ignored. \u00a0</p>\n<p>Harry pushed his glasses up and rubbed his eyes. He hadn\u2019t\nmeant to nearly fall asleep but, for all the pomp and pageantry, the\nwhole ordeal had been boring as piss. He didn\u2019t even remember\nmost of the kissing. The trepidation at first had quickly been\nreplaced with annoyance and then boredom. With his head turned to\npresent his cheek, all he saw of the other person was a shadowy\nsilhouette. If he closed his eyes, there was nothing to stop him from\npretending the whole thing was a strange dream.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhen I said you were giving up, I hardly thought this would\nbe the result.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry quickly pulled his glasses back on.</p>\n<p>Draco was walking along the top step of the riser, frowning\nirritably out at the students at the tables. He was wearing a pale\ngrey sweater vest over a crisp white dress shirt with impeccably\npressed black slacks as if he had just walked out of a posh advert\nrather than wallowing in the dungeons all day.</p>\n<p>Harry sat up, relief flooding his voice, \u201cDraco-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI mean really, this is just tacky in the extreme,\u201d\nDraco went on, stopping in front of Harry\u2019s chair, his back\nturned to him.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not like that,\u201d Harry said quickly, \u201cI\ntalked to McGonagall about doing it before- before we last talked.\nIt\u2019s just to get everyone to leave me alone.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cA good hex would have served you far better,\u201d Draco\nsaid.</p>\n<p>Harry shook his head, sliding to the edge of the chair and\nreaching out, \u201cI-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course\u00a0<i>you</i>\u00a0couldn\u2019t do that,\u201d\nDraco said a little bitterly.</p>\n<p>Harry touched his arm, \u201cDraco-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPansy said I ought to come, seems a wasted trip to me,\u201d\nDraco said.</p>\n<p>\u201cWould you look at me?\u201d Harry asked, tugging on\nDraco\u2019s forearm.</p>\n<p>Draco did turn, pulling his arm away. He was frowning faintly,\n\u201cI\u2019d rather not.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry looked Draco over, relieved to see he was well and couldn\u2019t\nkeep himself from smiling, \u201cYeah, well\u2026 Pansy told me\nabout-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t listen to her.\u201d Draco\ninterrupted, \u201cShe\u2019s a liar.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou don\u2019t even know what she told me,\u201d Harry\nsaid with faint disbelief.</p>\n<p>\u201cNothing good, I\u2019m certain,\u201d Draco said with a\nsniff, he looked Harry over critically and raised an eyebrow, \u201cYou\nlook completely ridiculous.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry pulled at the ermine-trimmed cape but it didn\u2019t budge,\n\u201cWasn\u2019t my idea.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI could have guessed that. You tend to err on the side of\ngrubby rather than ostentatious,\u201d Draco said.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not grubby,\u201d Harry protested.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Draco said, looking away, \u201cYou just dress\nthat way.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry sighed, trying not to roll his eyes, \u201cDraco. Pansy\ntold me that you don\u2019t remember what happened at the party.\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco\u2019s eyes narrowed, \u201c<i>That\u2019s</i>\u00a0what\nthis is all about? I don\u2019t normally drink that much you know. I\nwas just in a uniquely bad mood that night.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry\u2019s brow twitched, \u201cShe didn\u2019t tell you-?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAbout this horrible fiasco?\u201d Draco gestured around\nthe Great Hall with derision, \u201cOf course she did. Pansy is a\nvicious gossip. Never tell her a secret unless you want half the\nwizarding world to know it by tea. All of the wizarding world, once\nshe\u2019s working for that rag of a paper.\u201d He sneered at the\nlot of them, his hands shoved in his pockets.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s not what I meant,\u201d Harry said with\nmounting frustration.</p>\n<p>Draco huffed at him, \u201cI see now why she was so adamant I\ncome here, to put an end to old aspirations once and for all.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat in the world are you on about?\u201d Harry asked.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, I am at the front of the line,\u201d Draco shrugged\nand leaned down, his lips pressing to Harry\u2019s chaste, sudden\nand soft.</p>\n<p>Draco jerked back, his eyes widening, \u201c\u2026you\u00a0<i>knew</i>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI thought you knew,\u201d Harry said, \u201cI thought you\ndidn\u2019t want me.\u201d</p>\n<p>He stared at Harry in disbelief, \u201cWho in their right mind\nwouldn\u2019t want\u00a0<i>you</i>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI-\u201d Harry\u2019s words died in his throat.</p>\n<p>Draco smiled like Harry had never seen before, he practically\nshone.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u00a0<i>were</i>\u00a0courting me,\u201d Draco said.</p>\n<p>Harry nodded.</p>\n<p>Draco\u2019s gaze flicked up and he straightened, grabbing the\ncrown from Harry\u2019s head. Despite all of Luna\u2019s efforts\nthe crown pulled off his head easily with only a modicum of\nresistance from his rebellious hair. A few bobby pins plinked onto\nthe floor as Draco took out his wand and vanished the royal cloak\nfrom Harry\u2019s shoulders.</p>\n<p>\u201cMuch better,\u201d Draco said.</p>\n<p>Harry stood, \u201cDo you wanna get out of here?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFirst things first, Potter,\u201d Draco said, turning to\nthe hall and tossing the crown into the air where it hung for a\nsecond before hitting the ground with a bouncing, rolling, metallic\nclatter that drew the eyes of everyone in the room. Draco\u2019s\nchin lifted and he said, \u201cIf I have could have your attention,\nyou\u00a0<i>degenerates</i>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going to-\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco smirked, \u201cI am.\u201d His fingers grazed Harry\u2019s\ncheek as he slipped a hand around the nape of Harry\u2019s neck,\nleaning in and kissing him with a trepidation not suggested by his\nconfident words. Harry smiled, pressing his hand over Draco\u2019s,\nand kissed him back.</p>\n<p>There was a click and a flash that Harry could see through his\nclosed eyelids followed by a loud celebratory whoop.</p>\n<p>Blaise looked up over his large wizarding camera, his eyebrows so\nhigh they were trying to merge with his hairline.</p>\n<p>Pansy was beside him, \u201cDid you get it? Did you get the\nphoto?\u201d she asked, her hands clasped tightly together in front\nof her as she bounced with unbridled glee. Ron, Hermione and Luna\nwere with them, cheering loudly, Ginny was laughing, while the rest\nof the room stared open-mouthed.</p>\n<p>Draco cleared his throat, raising his voice over the commotion,\n\u201cIf any of you lay a hand on Potter again, I\u2019ll break\nyour face.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe won\u2019t,\u201d Harry said, grabbing Draco\u2019s\narm and pulling him down the risers.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u00a0<i>will</i>,\u201d Draco said.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid you\u2019ll have to settle for a weeks\ndetention if anyone should try,\u201d McGonagall said with a warning\ntone in her voice, \u201cThere shall be no personal retributions of\nany kind. Not that you shall be needing any after that display.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll say,\u201d Ron said, \u201cNever do anything\nhalfway, do you Malfoy?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe should celebrate!\u201d Luna said.</p>\n<p>Hermione nodded, \u201cOh, that\u2019d be nice!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou all can do whatever you want, Potter and I have things\nto do,\u201d Draco said, grabbing Harry\u2019s hand and pulling him\nto the door.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe do?\u201d Harry asked.</p>\n<p>\u201cA proper snog, for one,\u201d Draco said.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d Harry said with interest, picking up his pace.</p>\n<p>Behind them, Pansy snorted, \u201cDon\u2019t forget to get some\ngroping in.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShut up, Pansy!\u201d Draco yelled over his shoulder.</p>\n<p>The noise died away as they stepped out into the hallway.</p>\n<p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t be opposed to groping,\u201d Harry said.</p>\n<p>Draco flushed, turning his head away so Harry couldn\u2019t see,\n\u201cI\u2019ll take it into consideration.\u201d</p>\n<p>And They Lived Happily Ever After*</p>\n<p>~The End~</p>\n<p><br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p> <i>Dear Mr Potter</i></p>\n<p>\n<i> I was very pleased to hear from\nyou in Draco's latest correspondence. Although I do have to say that\nyou are entirely welcome to send me an owl of your own, should you be\nso inclined.</i>\n</p>\n<p>\n<i> I am very glad you are well. I\nknow it is not my place, but on occasion I find myself wondering\nafter your welfare. I am certain your friends and the Weasley family\nlook after your well being but I do worry about those times you are\nnot in their company. Perhaps it is the effect of the war but I find\nI can no longer take for granted the health and happiness of those\nimportant to me. I hope you don't mind my consideration of you as an\nimportant person to me and my family. It was your actions on our\nbehalf in the war, as well as the trials afterwards that brought on\nmy initial concern for your well being.</i>\n</p>\n<p><i> My perusal of the morning paper\nhas added an even greater reason to ask after you. I am glad Draco's\nfears were unfounded and doubly gladdened that the two of you have\nfound one another in such a rare and wondrous match. It seems as\nthough events happened far too quickly to afford the proper manner of\nthings so I grant you permission to court Draco now, knowing, in good\nfaith, that you would have certainly asked yourself if time had\npermitted. I am certain such a slip will not occur when you ask for\nmy son's hand. </i>\n</p>\n<p>\n<i> I look forward to seeing you in\nperson once yours and Draco's studies are finished. We shall have\nlunch and get to know one another properly.</i>\n</p>\n<p>\n<i> Most Sincerely,</i>\n</p>\n<p><i> Narcissa Malfoy </i>\n</p>\n<p><br>\n</p>\n<p> \u201cWhat are\nyou reading?\u201d Draco asked, leaning over to try and catch a\nglimpse.</p>\n<p> Harry pushed the\nletter into his hands and slumped back into the couch they were\nsharing, \u201cYour mother is terrifying.\u201d</p>\n<p> Draco frowned\nfaintly and carefully smoothed the parchment out before reading it,\nthe frown only growing as he reached the end of the letter. He sighed\nand folded the letter neatly closed.</p>\n<p> \u201cWas I\nreally supposed to ask her to court you?\u201d Harry asked.</p>\n<p> \u201cI suppose,\u201d\nDraco said mildly, \u201cIt's rather old fashioned and really she\noughtn't have expected it seeing as you are neither one of the old\nfamilies or were raised to know the old customs. And the rules are\nrather murky on who should do what in the case of two gentlemen\ncourting one another.\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cTerrifying,\u201d\nHarry muttered, slumping down further.</p>\n<p> \u201cShe didn't\nneed to be so embarrassing about it,\u201d Draco said, flicking the\nletter back at Harry and managing to hit him on the forehead with a\nsharp corner, \u201cBesides, I plan to be the one to ask.\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cAsk?\u201d\nHarry repeated, brushing the letter onto the floor.</p>\n<p> \u201cFor your\nhand,\u201d Draco said with a tsk of annoyance that Harry wasn't\nfollowing.</p>\n<p> Harry stared at\nhim, \u201c<i>What</i>? We've only been dating for a day!\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cNot <i>now</i>,\nof course,\u201d Draco said, \u201cIt wouldn't be proper to even\nconsider it until we're out of school and have settled into some sort\nof occupation.\u201d He paused as a thought occurred to him and\nasked warily, \u201cI wouldn't have to ask the Weasley's for your\nhand, would I?\u201d</p>\n<p> Harry was not\ndealing well with all this information but the terror of imagining\nDraco trying to ask Molly Weasley to marry him was enough to prompt a\nfrantic head shake.</p>\n<p> \u201cGood,\u201d\nDraco said. He leaned against Harry, \u201cThe whole point of me\nasking would be so we can avoid the whole mess entirely. I can't\nimagine asking the Weasley's even if we manage some sort of polite\nrapport.\u201d</p>\n<p> \u201cWell, I\ncan't imagine asking your parents at all,\u201d Harry said. He took\nadvantage of his slump to slide his head under Draco's chin.</p>\n<p> Draco slipped an\narm around him and rested his cheek atop Harry's hair, \u201cI\nsuppose... if they insist we'll just elope.\u201d</p>\n<p> Harry laughed, \u201cI\nsuppose so.\u201d</p>"
