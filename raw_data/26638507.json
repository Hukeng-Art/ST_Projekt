  "text": "<p>They catch the rogue on the morning of the first snow.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jimin\u2019s drawing sap with a handful of other omegas when his cousin runs to tell them the news. The day is cold and gloomy; Jimin had woken up with the scent of the soon-to-fall snow in his nostrils. Still, when the first flakes touch his skin and melt, he glances up at the sky in surprise. The clouds are thick, dark, and foreboding, and Jimin takes stock of the instinctual discomfort in his chest when Sana finds them.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIt took three alphas to bring him in,\u201d she tells them, eyes alight with a mix of fear and excitement. \u201cHis wolf is <em> huge </em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>The discomfort flutters, intensifies, and Jimin feels afraid.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat did he do?\u201d Taehyung asks, nearly knocking over a bucket in his curiosity.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Her voice lowers, and they lean closer to hear. \u201cScent-marked part of our territory.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin gasps along with the rest of them. Their territory is clearly marked; the rogue should not have set foot on it, let alone dared to make his mark. Though rogues have their own code of honor, their own set of rules, it\u2019s unspoken that packs and rogues don\u2019t mix.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDid you see it?\u201d Jimin asks, his heartbeat picking up speed. \u201cHis wolf.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI saw them drag him in. They have him chained up in the paddock for now.\u201d She\u2019s a little breathless, and Jimin thinks her gaze holds more excitement than fear. \u201cHe\u2019s a Gray Wolf alpha, prettiest fur I\u2019ve ever seen. White all down his belly.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat about the goats?\u201d Mina asks, brow furrowing.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThey\u2019ve been herded to the opposite side; there\u2019s enough room. Alpha Yoongi is keeping watch.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, what are we waiting for?\u201d Taehyung exclaims. \u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201d</p>\n<p>The others are in quick agreement, gathering up their buckets, but the fear stirs in Jimin\u2019s belly like a living thing. He has more reason than any to fear rogues; the capture breeds no curiosity for him. He doesn\u2019t have the luxury of feeling excited.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWe should finish collecting the sap,\u201d he says, and the others glance back at him.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe have more than enough,\u201d Tzuyu insists. \u201cCome on, Jiminie.\u201d</p>\n<p>They\u2019re already moving on without him. Wind stirs through the trees with a howl, pushing his fur-lined hood against his head. The snow is already collecting on the ground around him. He swallows harshly and follows.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The camp is in a frenzy when they arrive. Jimin spies his mother and others setting up a canopy of animal pelts over the fire to protect it. They\u2019ve already begun preparing seats for the elders in anticipation of the meeting. The pack will have to convene to decide the rogue\u2019s fate together.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Sensing his fear, Taehyung reaches back and takes Jimin\u2019s hand in his, the warmth of his skin seeping into Jimin\u2019s like a comfort. A small crowd of people have already gathered by the paddock, whispering among themselves. They push their way to the front, and Jimin\u2019s breath catches in his throat.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The rogue has shifted back to his human form, and Jimin doesn\u2019t want to imagine what his wolf looks like when he\u2019s threatening enough like this. He is defenseless in every way; chained firmly to the paddock, naked, snow collecting in his dark hair. But he looks like he could break his way out easily. He kneels in the dirt with his head held high, his muscles corded and sinewy, strength in every part of his body. Scars cover his body - on his thick arms, across his chest and abdomen, one on his jaw. A bracelet of what looks like a string of canines dangles from his wrist, looped twice, with a red bead in the midst of all the teeth.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He seems impervious to his audience. His gaze is fixed firmly on Yoongi, who paces on the other end of the paddock, keeping the goats at bay. Yoongi does not look back, but Jimin knows him well enough to pick up on the tension in his body. He\u2019s on guard.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The crowd parts, the murmuring quiets, and Jimin is jerked from his reverie. The Pack Alpha stops at the edge of the paddock, staring at the rogue.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOmega Jimin,\u201d he calls, and Jimin\u2019s blood freezes in his veins. \u201cFetch furs for the rogue.\u201d</p>\n<p>Everyone\u2019s looking at him; Jimin feels like melting into the ground.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI can do it,\u201d Taehyung offers immediately, squeezing Jimin\u2019s hand, but Dakho turns around and meets Jimin\u2019s eyes. His are unyielding as always.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI asked Omega Jimin.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, Alpha,\u201d Jimin murmurs, ducking his head and walking quickly to the tent where they have been building up their stores for the winter. He has long since stopped railing at the unfairness of the Pack Alpha\u2019s treatment. He finds it easier to give in.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jimin opens a trunk full of furs and digs out the largest pelt. It has not yet been shaped into a coat, but it will be enough to keep the rogue warm for now. When he returns to the paddock, he pushes open the swinging gate and steps inside. Yoongi nods to him. He can see the way Yoongi tenses more visibly now, abandoning his pacing in favor of turning his body toward the rogue, ready to jump in if Jimin needs him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cFather,\u201d a voice calls, and Jimin looks over. Seungcheol comes to a stop by the Pack Alpha\u2019s side. \u201cLet me do it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOmega Jimin will do it.\u201d Pack Alpha Dakho\u2019s voice is firm, and Jimin doesn\u2019t know why Seungcheol even bothered. He looks like he wants to argue, but he turns his gaze on Jimin instead.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jimin looks away.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The rogue has finally torn his gaze away from Yoongi to look at Jimin now, his nostrils flaring as he picks up on Jimin\u2019s scent. His gaze is heavy, but Jimin walks toward him with steady steps. They have him chained under the covered part of the canopy, but still the snow has blown to settle on his hair and skin. Jimin can see a glittering flake suspended on the end of his lashes.</p>\n<p>Jimin kneels, his breath catching when the rogue\u2019s musky scent hits him, strong cloves and cinnamon. Jimin has never encountered a scent so potent, so raw, so <em> alpha </em> that he finds himself briefly unable to move. In the pack, their scents are mixed with each other\u2019s; Jimin knows his own is always muddled by Taehyung\u2019s and Sana\u2019s and his mother\u2019s, given the frequent scenting. But the rogue smells of no one but himself, unrestrained, heady. Jimin\u2019s omega wants to submit on instinct.</p>\n<p>He fights it back, swallowing harshly, breathing through his mouth. His hands tremble, but he reaches to drape the pelt around him. He flinches when the rogue lets out a breath that tickles his skin, and the rogue notices. Jimin wonders if he imagines the way the tension leaves the rogue\u2019s body, the way he makes himself a little smaller.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jimin\u2019s heartbeat picks up. He holds his breath, secures the pelt, then stands. When he turns away, he clutches the fur of his own coat to hide the way his hands shake as he walks out of the paddock. He can breathe again.</p>\n<p>\u201cThank you, Omega Jimin,\u201d says Dakho, and Jimin nods.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He avoids Seungcheol, though he can feel his attention. He bypasses the crowd and finds his mother, setting to work on the canopy, and he finally lets himself breathe again. The rogue\u2019s scent is still strong in his nostrils. His mother gives him a look full of worry, but he forces a smile for her.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Taehyung\u2019s father has begun to light the incense, and the elders are making their way to the fire. Elder Man holds her hand out, and Jimin takes her arm and helps her take a seat on a pile of cushions set out of her.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDo not be so afraid,\u201d she tells him quietly, patting his hand in comfort.</p>\n<p>\u201cI am not afraid.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI may be old, but my nose still works,\u201d she says wryly, and this time his smile isn\u2019t forced.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jimin stands on the outskirts, not quite covered by the canopy, where the snow catches in the fur lining his hood. The entire pack has gathered, even the pups, hovering on the edges, watching with wide eyes or lobbing snowballs at each other when their parents look elsewhere.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jimin\u2019s earliest memory is of the tribe convening under the embroidered canopy. He hadn\u2019t hovered at the edges then; he had sat by the fire with his mother, the stern gaze of the elders fixed on him. They had made the decision to banish his father that day. He was too young to remember much, but he remembers little things: the way the fire had been too hot, and how sweat had beaded on his temples. The way he had been picking at a thread on his mother\u2019s shirt until she swatted his hand away.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cBring him,\u201d says Elder Yang, and two other alphas join Yoongi in the paddock to move the rogue.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t fight them off, letting them lead him over and sit him by the fire.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cUntie him.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin starts, surprised that they would dare. The alphas look surprised, too, exchanging glances. But no one questions the elders, so they untie him. The rogue moves to tighten the pelt around his body. He remains kneeling, resting his hands on his knees as he faces the elders.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThe Choi Pack convenes to discuss the fate of a trespassing rogue,\u201d says Elder Yang, her voice ringing throughout the clearing. Taehyung finds his way to Jimin\u2019s side, brushing their shoulders together. \u201cWe would have your name.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cJungkook,\u201d answers the rogue. His voice is strong; it betrays no wariness or regret.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cFirst, there is the matter of you trespassing on our territory. Alphas Yoongi, Hoseok, and Namjoon found you within the borders of our land. You proceeded to attack them when they approached you. Explain yourself.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI was caught in an altercation with another rogue,\u201d says Jungkook. \u201cIn my haste to escape, I crossed into your territory without realizing it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd the scent-marking? What drove you to mark another pack\u2019s territory?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI had to piss.\u201d</p>\n<p>No one dares to laugh, but Jimin sees more than one person clapping a hand over their mouth to stop themselves. His own fear is driven briefly away in favor of amusement, but he sobers quickly enough.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIt would be wise to check your arrogance,\u201d says Elder Man, \u201cgiven the situation you\u2019re in.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin sees the way Jungkook\u2019s jaw tightens.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI mean you no harm,\u201d he says stiffly. \u201cLet me be on my way, and you will never see my face again.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou have seen enough of our territory to be of harm to us. There are many who would like to have that knowledge.\u201d Elder Nam clears his throat, addressing the pack instead. \u201cThe pack will make its decision as one. Having heard the rogue\u2019s side, we will now consider our options. At dawn, we will meet again.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe rogue will be given a place to sleep and food to eat,\u201d Alpha Dakho decides. \u201cOmega Mina and Beta Seokjin, prepare a place for the rogue to rest. Omega Jimin will take charge of his meals.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin winces. Of course.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Mina and Seokjin disperse to do their task, and Jimin breaks away to do his own. He heads toward the tent he shares with his mother, Sana, and his aunt and uncle. Just before he lifts the flap to enter, a voice at his back stops him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cJimin.\u201d</p>\n<p>Naturally, it belongs to Seungcheol. Jimin turns to face him, trying not to look as stiff as he feels. \u201cYes, Alpha Seungcheol?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThere is no need to call me that. I have told you before.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin grinds his teeth together. \u201cDid you need something?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI wanted to apologize for my father\u2019s behavior,\u201d he says, and some of the bitterness in Jimin\u2019s heart eases. \u201cIt\u2019s not fair of him to treat you the way he is. I will accompany you to deliver the rogue\u2019s meals.\u201d</p>\n<p>The bitterness returns as soon as it fades. \u201cThat will not be necessary.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLet me protect you,\u201d Seungcheol\u2019s voice is assured, his handsome face framed by his snowy hood. He wears the pelt of a bear, another mark of his prowess. No one else of their generation has yet to kill a bear. Seungcheol\u2019s father killed one in his youth, and two of the elders as well. They say Jimin\u2019s father had the pelt of a bear. \u201cIt is the least I can do to account for my father\u2019s unfair attention.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin sighs. He can tell he won\u2019t be able to sway Seungcheol easily. It\u2019s only because of him that his father pays Jimin any attention at all. The Pack Alpha had been kind to Jimin as a child, until they grew up and Seungcheol made his intentions clear. It seemed that Jimin\u2019s alpha-less life was only pitiable until it came to the question of mating his son. Then it became a disgrace.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jimin liked Seungcheol well enough, but now he wants nothing to do with him. He can\u2019t bear the way the rest of the pack looks at him. Seungcheol had told him it did not matter, that they were only jealous, but Jimin knows there\u2019s more to it than that. They don\u2019t think he\u2019s worthy.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAlright,\u201d Jimin agrees reluctantly. \u201cPlease wait while I prepare the meal.\u201d</p>\n<p>Seungcheol nods, and Jimin ducks inside his tent. He starts a fire and boils tea with goat\u2019s milk, then prepares a plate of dried meat with herbed vegetables. Their pack takes meals together, but every tent has a small store of food just in case. He places the bowl of tea and plate of food on a painted tray then leaves the tent.</p>\n<p>Seungcheol falls into step beside him. Jimin tries to pretend he doesn\u2019t feel the stares of the other pack members. His presence feels even more unnecessary when Jimin finds three alphas keeping guard around the storage tent, which they seem to have converted into a place for the rogue to sleep.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Seungcheol lifts the flap, letting Jimin through, and waits there with it raised. The stores have been cleared out, leaving bedding in the middle of the room and a bowl for washing in the corner. Jungkook sits on the bedding now, arms wrapped loosely around his knees. Someone has found him clothes, but he still wears the pelt around his shoulders. He looks up at Jimin\u2019s entrance, nostrils flaring like before. He can\u2019t have been inside the tent for long, but already his scent fills it, and Jimin finds it even more difficult to bear in the close proximity.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDinner,\u201d Jimin says, struggling to get his voice out, crouching to place the tray carefully before him. His mind feels hazy.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jungkook looks down at it, then back up. \u201cThank you,\u201d he says, voice low.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The alphas of Jimin\u2019s pack are tough as nails, and so are the omegas; it is not an easy life they live. But Jungkook is something else, something beyond the rest of them. He is battle-hardened.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jimin nods, Adam\u2019s apple jumping as he swallows, and leaves.\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u2744</p>\n<p>The morning brings with it snow that falls hard and heavy, and news far more pressing than a trespassing rogue.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The tribe does not convene to decide Jungkook\u2019s fate; the elders spend it in conversation with the Pack Alpha instead. Jimin brings Jungkook a breakfast of tea and sweet bread, Seungcheol hovering over his shoulder, and again Jungkook thanks him in his low voice. Later, when he\u2019s tending to the goats with Sana, he learns of what has happened.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Their pack\u2019s territory lies not far from that of the Yoo Clan, who are known for being particularly vicious. No man\u2019s land acts as a buffer between the two packs, but for years the Yoo Clan has tried their hardest to encroach upon their territory. On their nightly patrol, some of the alphas from Jimin\u2019s pack discovered the Yoo Clan had scent-marked their territory halfway into the no-man\u2019s land.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Their actions are a bid for war. Jimin\u2019s pack is mostly peaceful, tending to stay out of disputes, but something like this cannot be ignored.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you think it is related?\u201d Jimin asks, checking one of the goat\u2019s hooves for rot. Jungkook could be spying. \u201cThe rogue, I mean.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sana shrugs. \u201cCould be. They do say packs hire rogues out for things like this.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin hums, moving on to the next goat.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou have been giving the rogue meals. What is he like?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI haven\u2019t spoken to him much.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo?\u201d Sana glances up, eyes glittering with surprise. Jimin frowns at her. \u201cWhy not?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy would I? He is dangerous.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, yes, but are you not curious?\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin pauses in his task, frown deepening. \u201cCurious?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAbout your father.\u201d</p>\n<p>She hesitates right after she speaks, belatedly realizing that maybe she should not have brought up Jimin\u2019s father after all. Jimin returns to checking the hooves, but he feels unsettled.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d he mumbles. \u201cI suppose I did not think to ask.\u201d</p>\n<p>She doesn\u2019t tell him he should, but he knows she\u2019s thinking it. They finish their work in silence and join his mother to begin mending blankets. Naturally, Jimin can\u2019t get Sana\u2019s words out of his head.\u00a0</p>\n<p>When Jimin\u2019s father was banished, he would have had no other choice but to become a rogue. Packs don\u2019t take in cast-offs. Werewolf packs of the north have dwindled over time; there are few of them left, and even less of them are packless. Unless Jimin\u2019s father had left the north entirely, the chance that Jungkook has run into him over the years is very high. They say the rogues have some sort of ranking system, and that they seek each other out often.\u00a0</p>\n<p>But there\u2019s no reason to ask, not really. Jimin\u2019s father is the reason he\u2019s so frightened of Jungkook to begin with.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Later, while Jimin prepares a nighttime meal for Jungkook, his mother asks him to be careful.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThey live a very different life than us,\u201d she tells him quietly, bent over her weaving. \u201cOne full of violence.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin thinks of the scars on Jungkook\u2019s body. It must have been suited to his father, then, a life full of violence. Jimin remembers very little of his father; he was far too young when he was banished. Most of what he knows is hearsay. His mother told him enough to tide him over, back when he first presented and felt like an adult. He was cruel. He hurt her. The pack could not let it continue.\u00a0</p>\n<p>From the others, he\u2019s caught snippets of other stories - his father used to catch squirrels and burn them alive; as a young man, his father used to beg for war. His father used to disappear overnight and return with the scent of omegas from other packs clinging to his skin, even after he mated Jimin\u2019s mother. In all his years, Jimin has never heard a good story about his father.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI am glad Seungcheol has been accompanying you,\u201d she continues. \u201cBe sure not to go without him.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThere are three alphas guarding him,\u201d Jimin mutters. \u201cEven if Seungcheol is not there, it does not matter.\u201d</p>\n<p>His mother sighs. She\u2019s long since given up on arguing with him about Seungcheol.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jimin delivers Jungkook his meal, and after Jungkook thanks him, Jimin hesitates. He stares at the jagged scar that stretches from Jungkook\u2019s wrist to his elbow and considers asking him. He wonders what he would even say. <em> Excuse me, do you know my father? I do not know anything about him except that he was horrible </em>.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He can feel the weight of Jungkook\u2019s gaze and glances back up. Jungkook\u2019s head is tilted expectantly, one eyebrow raised, long hair falling to frame his face. He\u2019s waiting. Jimin clears his throat and leaves. There\u2019s little he can say with Seungcheol hovering over his shoulder, anyway.\u00a0</p>\n<p>That night, Jimin lies awake by his mother\u2019s side, restless. He can hear her soft breaths in sleep, the gentle snores of his uncle on the other end of the tent. Outside, the light fall of snow continues. He has to ask. It will haunt him forever if he doesn\u2019t, just like his father\u2019s presence has haunted him for as long as he can remember.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jimin wakes well before dawn.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He prepares Jungkook\u2019s breakfast while his mother and Sana sleep on; his aunt and uncle are already awake and about, accustomed to being early risers. Leaving the tent so early, before light breaks through the clouds, feels oddly surreal. The snow has stopped, but the ground is thick with it. He wades through it, shivering, to Jungkook\u2019s tent. No one is awake save for a few people here and there.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He pauses outside Jungkook\u2019s tent and wonders if he\u2019s even awake. But then he hears him move, so he announces his presence and lifts the flap.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jungkook is wrapped in furs, shivering even harder than Jimin. The storage tent is built without smoke flaps, so he can\u2019t build a fire. Jimin frowns, feeling abruptly guilty.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you need more furs?\u201d he asks.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jungkook looks surprised that he\u2019s being spoken to. His gaze shifts behind Jimin, as if looking for someone, then back to him. \u201cNo.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin nods and sets the tray before him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Jungkook says, as always.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Unlike always, Jimin kneels before him, hands clenched into fists in his coat as he quells his nervousness. He never lingers for more than a moment, and now that he\u2019s sitting here, Jungkook\u2019s scent overwhelms him. The powerful cloves and cinnamon fill Jimin\u2019s lungs until he finds it hard to breathe. His head swims. \u201cI have a question.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jungkook\u2019s guarded eyes flicker. He drapes an arm over his knee. \u201cWhere is your intended? Not an early riser?\u201d</p>\n<p>A flush rises to Jimin\u2019s cheeks. \u201cHe is not my intended. And that\u2019s none of your business.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI have a feeling whatever you are about to ask me is none of your business, either.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDo I not?\u201d His tone is arrogant, the tilt of his head more so. Jimin regrets coming here, regrets asking. Regrets pitying him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI haven\u2019t asked.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAsk, then.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin swallows, throat dry. \u201cOut there, did you - did you know an alpha by the name of Park? He would be about the Pack Alpha\u2019s age.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jungkook\u2019s expression is impassive. \u201cWe do not have family names <em> out there </em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>Something about the way he says it feels like mockery. Jimin\u2019s face grows hotter. Of course they have no use for family names. He feels like a fool. He knows nothing about rogues, yet here he is, acting like he does.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cKangdae was his name. He has been packless since the Great Blizzard.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jungkook is silent for so long that Jimin fears he won\u2019t answer after all. \u201cI knew him,\u201d he finally says.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jimin\u2019s heart stutters, then swells into his throat. \u201cKnew?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe is dead.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jungkook\u2019s blunt about it, but Jimin feels very little sadness at the thought. His father has been dead to him his whole life. \u201cHow long?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTwo winters.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat did - what did you know about him?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe was the number one,\u201d Jungkook says, and Jimin\u2019s breath catches.\u00a0</p>\n<p>His knowledge of the ranking system is lacking, but he does know that in order to increase rank, one must kill the rank that precedes yours. The First Rank is the most coveted; kill the number one, and the killer will take their place. It\u2019s a life of constant danger.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHe was killed for his rank?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course.\u201d Jungkook leans back. He no longer shivers. He gazes at Jimin through lidded eyes, and something about the way he looks at him feels dangerous. Like a predator looking at its prey. Jimin is not used to being prey. He\u2019s a wolf, after all. \u201cHe was your father,\u201d he discerns, and Jimin finds himself nodding.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI did not know him.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>He clears his throat, abruptly uncomfortable. He shouldn\u2019t be here. It shouldn\u2019t matter that his father is dead, that his father was number one. His father is barely even his father. Can someone be family if they only share your blood? If you cannot remember their face?</p>\n<p>Rubbing his palms against his coat, Jimin stands. \u201cI will take my leave. Thank you for telling me what you know.\u201d</p>\n<p>In lieu of a response, Jungkook watches him with that same, lidded gaze. Lifting the flap, Jimin pauses, glancing back.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat is your rank?\u201d he asks out of pure curiosity, not really expecting a response.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The corner of Jungkook\u2019s mouth lifts up. It\u2019s not a smile - not really.</p>\n<p>\u201cFirst.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u2744</p>\n<p>Jimin feels sick.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The air is cold, but still the fire in their tent feels like too much, and he writhes away from it, sweat dripping down his skin. His shirt clings uncomfortably to his neck, and it feels tight, choking him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIt can\u2019t be your heat.\u201d His mother presses a worried hand against his forehead. \u201cIt isn\u2019t your time.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou must have caught a fever.\u201d Sana\u2019s already brewing an herbal tea for him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jimin strips off his blanket, breath coming quick and heavy. His body feels like it\u2019s on fire, but all he can think about is Jungkook. Number one. His father\u2019s killer. He hasn\u2019t told his mother yet, of course, hasn\u2019t told anyone, and the secret feels like it\u2019s suffocating him. He should have known, should have guessed it. The red bead on his bracelet has the number one etched into it. But Jimin had only noticed in a passing way.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHurts,\u201d he mumbles, clutching his belly.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDid you eat something bad?\u201d His mother frowns. \u201cYou do smell a little like heat, maybe it has come early?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy would it?\u201d Sana says. \u201cJimin is always so regular.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin wipes a droplet of sweat from his eye and wonders the same thing. He hasn\u2019t had an early heat since the first two years after he presented, when he was irregular anyway. But if it isn\u2019t a heat, it\u2019s a fever, and that alternative feels worse. Last winter, they had lost two to fever.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He rolls over, clutching his belly, and hears someone outside shout. They ignore it, but then there\u2019s another, and another, until the commotion outside grows and they all shift in confusion. Jimin sits up, and his mother stands.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s happening?\u201d Sana breathes, and Jimin can see his own fear reflected in her eyes.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The flap of their tent lifts, and Taehyung\u2019s standing there, eyes wide, chest heaving. \u201cThe Yoo Clan. They\u2019re attacking. We have to go.\u201d</p>\n<p>They\u2019re all moving before he can finish speaking.\u00a0</p>\n<p>His mother snatches up the emergency bag she keeps in case of such a situation, and Jimin stumbles to his feet and wraps his furs around himself. Sana is already dressed, and she drops to her knees to help him put on his boots before grabbing his hand and leading him behind her.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAlpha Dakho says we take the pups and go,\u201d Taehyung says as they follow him out.</p>\n<p>The camp is chaos. Someone\u2019s stamping out the fire, and others are scrambling to save whatever of their possessions they can transport. At the edge of camp, Jimin sees Yoongi and Hoseok and Namjoon stripping off their clothes before shifting into their wolf forms and running off into the woods.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jimin follows Sana to where Seokjin and his father are herding a few of the pups away. \u201cFollow the river,\u201d he tells them, and they all take a few pups in hand and start to run.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The adrenaline outdoes the fear; Jimin moves and feels nothing but urgency. He has one pup on his hip and another at his heels, and he can see his mother ahead of him and hear Taehyung\u2019s voice behind him. The river will be cold, but it\u2019ll mask their scents. Their footprints are clear in the snow, but towards the back, Jimin can see Seokjin and Tzuyu following with a brush, clearing away their prints as they move.</p>\n<p>Their pack had been attacked once, when his mother was pregnant with him. Six alphas died, and one omega was taken, never to be heard from again. He\u2019s heard the story many times; even now, they tell it around the fire, a sobering tale of what danger lies out there. The constant threat of danger makes the pack essential. Stay with the pack, and maybe you\u2019ll survive.\u00a0</p>\n<p>They reach the river before long, and Jimin struggles to breathe, chest heaving from exertion. He sets the pup down, and she runs to join her father. Everyone sets to work covering themselves with mud and water, masking their scents, sticking close to the banks of the river where their prints will be washed away before long.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cMore,\u201d Taehyung tells him. \u201cI can still smell you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin reaches for more mud. Taehyung frowns, leaning in, and sniffs at his neck.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cJimin,\u201d he says. \u201cAre you in heat?\u201d</p>\n<p>The pain in his belly intensifies, a reminder. He grows aware again of how hot his body is despite the cold air. As if on cue, he leaks a gush of slick. Taehyung\u2019s nose wrinkles.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou are,\u201d he says, surprised at first and then afraid. Jimin sees the way his expression changes.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The scent of a heat cannot be masked.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jimin can lather himself in as much mud as he wants - can douse himself in the river, even, but his scent will carry. His hands fall to his sides. He looks around, at the pups sitting in the mud, at Mina, who has started crying now that the adrenaline has settled. He looks at his mother.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI have to go.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cJimin, no - \u201d Taehyung\u2019s voice rises in a cry, but Jimin\u2019s already backing away.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He cannot put the rest of them in danger.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cJimin, please - \u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin turns away and begins to run.\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u2744</p>\n<p>It hurts too much to move. Jimin lies at the base of a tree, arms wrapped tightly around himself, using every last bit of strength to keep from whimpering. Not that it matters; they\u2019ll smell him long before they hear him. He\u2019s drenched with sweat, his discarded furs lying at his feet, though logically he knows he must wear them. He might feel hot, but the freezing air will still hurt his body.\u00a0</p>\n<p>But he has begun to move past the point of logic.\u00a0</p>\n<p>In his 24 winters of life, Jimin has never once felt so helpless.\u00a0</p>\n<p>It won\u2019t take long for the Yoo Clan to find him. They will rape him if they do; he knows that. He wonders if maybe it would be easier to kill himself. But he can barely lift an arm, the weakness taking hold, and so even that choice has been taken from him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>His nose twitches, and he breathes in the familiar scent of cloves and cinnamon. His body registers <em> alpha </em>, and he whimpers, head lifting up on instinct.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cShit.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jungkook stares down at him with a troubled frown, his nose wrinkled. He must have escaped during the chaos.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Part of Jimin wants to lean toward him, reach out for him, beg for him. But enough lucidity remains for him to recoil. \u201cNo,\u201d he rasps. \u201cDon\u2019t touch me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jungkook takes a step back. He looks away, then he looks back down at Jimin. His frown deepens. He takes another step away, and Jimin\u2019s eyes drift shut. It\u2019s better if Jungkook leaves. Jimin can\u2019t trust him any more than the Yoo Clan.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He hears twigs snap beneath heavy feet and opens his eyes.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jungkook\u2019s wolf is as large as Sana had said - he\u2019s as beautiful, too. The white of his neck and belly is pristine, glowing in the afternoon light, the gray on top just as sleek. His eyes glitter, and he stands powerful and massive, and Jimin\u2019s afraid. The bracelet of canines has been unlooped, large enough to remain around the front leg of his wolf.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Then Jungkook crouches, presenting his back for Jimin, and Jimin\u2019s breath hitches.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He wants him to come.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jimin can\u2019t tell if he is being saved or taken into something even worse. He shakes his head and pulls back.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jungkook growls, low and menacing. He drops the clothes in his mouth and his massive jaw and glinting teeth come for Jimin instead. Before Jimin can cry out, Jungkook\u2019s teeth snag on the back of his shirt and lift him bodily, tossing him onto his back like a rag doll. Jimin scrabbles for purchase, grabbing onto Jungkook\u2019s thick, soft fur before he falls.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jungkook picks the wad of clothing back up, then he starts to run.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jimin holds on with all his strength, jostled back and forth as Jungkook weaves through the land. At first, he\u2019s afraid, considers letting go, but he has no doubt that Jungkook would stop and come back for him - and he might break a few bones in the process. Then he begins to go in and out of consciousness, his body exhausting itself to sleep, jerking awake here and there when the path grows rougher.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He isn\u2019t lucid enough to keep track of how long they travel. When Jungkook finally comes to a stop, the terrain is rocky, snow-covered cliffs rising above them. He finds them a small cave, brushing snow out of the mouth with his snout, and deposits Jimin in the back, well away from the reach of the wind that blows snow inside. Jungkook rubs himself on every corner of the cave, his cinnamon and cloves growing stronger and stronger until a low whine starts in the back of Jimin\u2019s throat.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jungkook shifts back into his human form, slipping into his clothes before the cold can hurt him. Then he turns back to face him, and Jimin\u2019s whine grows full-blown. He\u2019s leaking so much slick now that his thighs slide together.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAlpha,\u201d he slurs, lashes fluttering, reaching for him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jungkook ignores him. He picks his fur pelt off the ground and approaches, crouching by Jimin\u2019s side and wrapping it around him. Jimin whimpers at the proximity, Jungkook\u2019s heady scent filling his lungs.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAlpha, please.\u201d He pushes himself up, nosing his way to Jungkook\u2019s scent gland, but he\u2019s promptly stopped by Jungkook\u2019s firm grip on the back of his neck. He falls limp with a quiet whine.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Jungkook says sternly, and Jimin wilts, his eyes filling with tears. Jungkook pushes him down and Jimin rests on the fur as if it\u2019s bedding, sobbing quietly.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHurts,\u201d he sniffs, rubbing his nose into the pelt for Jungkook\u2019s scent. Jungkook moves away, and Jimin chokes out another sob, feeling unwanted and unworthy.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jungkook leaves the cave and some of the intensity of his scent eases. Jimin turns over onto his belly, hips pushing against the furs for the much-needed pressure on his cock. He\u2019s using whatever last willpower he has to restrain from doing any more than that when Jungkook returns, arms laden with firewood. Jimin calls out to him, feeling weak and pathetic, but Jungkook sets to building the fire. His jaw is tight, and he doesn\u2019t look over at Jimin once.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cPlease, alpha,\u201d Jimin whines, the tears in his eyes a mix of need, shame, and hurt. \u201cN - need you.\u201d</p>\n<p>When the fire has been built up to a comfortable height, Jungkook leaves the cave again. This time he does not return.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jimin loses the last of his strength while he waits and spends the rest of the time rutting against the furs. By the evening, he has slipped fully into the heat headspace, and he holds very little awareness for what happens over the next few days. He\u2019s lucid for bits and pieces of it. He knows he dreams about Jungkook fucking him hard and fast into the rough cave floor, knot swelling inside him until he screams; he knows he tells Jungkook about it, too, but he gets ignored again.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jimin\u2019s mind works only as far as Jungkook\u2019s scent and his own need. Jimin thinks Jungkook walks in on him with three fingers up his ass at one point, and he isn\u2019t delirious enough when it happens to avoid the burst of humiliation. He knows Jungkook spends too much time outside the cave, but during one of his lucid stretches, he realizes it begins snowing again, and after that Jungkook stays inside with him. It\u2019s harder when he is there. During a break in his heat, Jungkook forces him to eat, but it comes back while he tries to eat and he ends up in Jungkook\u2019s lap, begging, promising. Jungkook holds him firm - he thinks he makes him finish eating the radish, too - and then deposits him back on his makeshift furs.\u00a0</p>\n<p>It stops snowing, and Jungkook returns to staying outside of the cave. Sometimes Jimin notices new things in the cave: another bedroll, an extra bowl and cup for meals. Jungkook is caring for him in the best way he can, but Jimin\u2019s omega suffers through the worst heat he has ever had. His hormones rage from Jungkook\u2019s proximity, from the strength, the rawness of his scent. Bearing his heat is so much harder when there is an alpha right next to him who could make the pain go away.\u00a0</p>\n<p>In his old pack, unmated omegas spent their heats in a special tent set at a small distance from the main encampment. Their omega family members would come to care for them, bringing them food and filling tubs of water for them to bathe in. The betas would stand guard. It was the same for unmated alphas and their ruts. There was never any proximity to alphas during heats or omegas during ruts; the pain was far easier to bear when you smelled no alphas nearby. You knew you were alone.\u00a0</p>\n<p>But Jimin is not alone. Jungkook\u2019s scent fills his lungs until he\u2019s delirious with it, until his mind is a haze of desperation and desire. By the third day of his heat, he loses his last shred of sense, and after that everything is a blur.\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u2744</p>\n<p>When Jimin wakes, he feels his lucidity returning to him, and with it his sense of his surroundings. He\u2019s being carried, surrounded by Jungkook\u2019s heady scent, and the air is cold against his skin. Jungkook\u2019s pelt is wrapped around him, and it embarrasses him to feel how <em> wet </em> he is - covered in cum and slick and drool and tears. The dampness only makes him colder. He shivers, curling into the warmth of Jungkook\u2019s chest on instinct.\u00a0</p>\n<p>If Jungkook registers his waking, he doesn\u2019t show it.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jimin hears the rushing of the river, smells the fresh water sharp in his nostrils. Jungkook sets him down by the bank with a bar of soap at his side. Jimin catches the implication. The water is cold, so he works quickly, stripping off his clothes and leaving them on the ground before hopping into the water to wash himself. While he bathes, Jungkook takes his clothes and scrubs them clean on a makeshift washboard fashioned from smoothed down sticks.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The embarrassment sits hot in Jimin\u2019s belly. As if the past few days of begging were not terrible enough, now Jungkook is washing the cum and slick out of his clothes. He can\u2019t remember the last time he felt so humiliated - perhaps the day Seungcheol had announced his desire to court Jimin in front of everyone, and Jimin had felt the way everyone looked at him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>His clothes will take time to dry, so Jimin shifts into his wolf form and follows Jungkook back to the cave with them bundled in his jaws. The strong scent of his heat lingers in the cave and feeds the humiliation further. He lays the clothes out by the fire to dry and curls up in a corner, watching Jungkook with wary eyes.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jungkook doesn\u2019t seem bothered. He leaves the cave and returns dragging the pelt of a bear, at the sight of which Jimin whines.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou left your furs behind,\u201d is all Jungkook says, and Jimin is left watching with wide eyes as he begins to work with the pelt.\u00a0</p>\n<p>In his pack, a gift of furs would mean a courtship. Jimin isn\u2019t fool enough to think Jungkook\u2019s courting him, but still - the implication is heavy. Jungkook must know it is.\u00a0</p>\n<p>When his clothes have dried enough to be bearable, Jimin shifts back and dresses. He goes to sit by the fire, across from where Jungkook still works on the bear, with stiff shoulders and a set jaw.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhere did you get the pelt?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI killed it. I was saving it in a place not far from here while it tanned.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin nods. \u201cI have to return to my pack.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jungkook doesn\u2019t spare him a glance. He works with efficiency, and Jimin wonders how many bears he has felled over his lifetime. \u201cYour pack is most likely dead by now. If not dead, taken.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin\u2019s heart stops full in his chest. It stutters back to a start, but his breath doesn\u2019t come with it. \u201cYou do not know that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYour pack is small, your alphas weak. I know it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin\u2019s hands curl into fists. \u201cWhy did you not leave me there to die with my weak pack then?\u201d</p>\n<p>Jungkook pauses briefly, glancing up at him. His eyes are hard. \u201cYou think they would have killed you, an omega in heat?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jimin\u2019s face flames hot with shame and fear. He knows Jungkook is right; he saved his life. Still, Jimin has to find his family. They can\u2019t be dead; he refuses to believe it. Some of them must have made it out. If there is even just one member of his pack left alive, he would die trying to find them.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThank you for saving me,\u201d Jimin says stiffly. \u201cI owe you a debt. But I must return to my pack.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin stands, and Jungkook sets down the pelt with a deliberate gesture. He wipes his hands on a rag, and he stands, too. Jimin registers the way Jungkook towers over him, power in every inch of his body, and tries not to shrink back.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI cannot let you leave.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin clenches his fists tighter to hide the way they tremble. \u201cYou can\u2019t keep me against my will.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou want to go back out there, reeking of heat?\u201d He tosses the rag away with a sharp gesture. Jimin follows the line of his arm with a harsh swallow, noting the way his corded muscles pop. \u201cBe my guest. But you carry my scent now, too.\u201d</p>\n<p>His words are true enough. The pelt that Jungkook had wrapped around his body for three days carries his scent heavily, and after Jimin spent another two in it, their scents have inevitably mixed.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd?\u201d Jimin demands.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI will not let your foolishness lead my enemies straight to me. You\u2019re stuck with me whether you like it or not.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI am not afraid of you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jungkook takes a step forward, then another, and the sound of them is heavy, echoing throughout the small cave. Jimin swallows, forces himself to stay still, to not back down, even as Jungkook stops just inches from him, his scent filling the air between them until it\u2019s unbearable.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI killed your father like it was nothing.\u201d His voice is low, but it fills the air like a shout. \u201cAnd he was number one, a king among the packless.\u201d He fists a hand in Jimin\u2019s hair, tugging his head to the side, baring his neck forcibly. Jimin\u2019s knees quake. He swallows back tears. Jungkook leans in, hovering over his scent gland. \u201cI can smell your fear.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin wills his body to move. He pulls away, and Jungkook lets him go easily.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m number one now,\u201d Jungkook says, voice hard. \u201cYou would do well to be afraid.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u2744</p>\n<p>That night, curled up in the furthest corner of the cave, still wrapped in the pelts that smell of Jungkook, Jimin cries.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He cries for his lost family, for his destroyed pack, because he knows that even if they live, things will never be the same again. Some of them must have died - even Jimin is not fool enough to doubt that. They would have killed the alphas first. He wonders who lies among the dead tonight, if it is Yoongi - good, kind Yoongi, who had cared for Jimin in his quiet way since they were children. Or Seungcheol, who Jimin had liked until Seungcheol fell in love, Seungcheol who had been good enough to want Jimin even despite his tainted background. He wonders if the Pack Alpha had survived, and finds that the thought of his death fills him with an unbearable sadness despite their turbulent relationship.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t want to think about what might have happened to the omegas, or to the children.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jimin cries for himself, too, because he is lost and afraid and the man he has no choice but to depend on is the killer of his father. Jimin doesn\u2019t feel strong enough to bear the weight of the sadness that sits on his shoulders.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He wonders how long he will last before he crumbles.\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u2744</p>\n<p>On the day Jungkook finishes Jimin\u2019s coat, a foreign scent rides the wind.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The coat is thick and warm, the clean fur sitting soft and smooth, black as night. Jimin dons it with a mixture of awe and bitterness. Donning a coat made by an alpha for the first time carries a great deal of weight in his pack. When he was young, he had always imagined what it would be like to be courted, to have an alpha painstakingly craft a coat by hand that was just for him. He had imagined how it would feel to put it on for the first time.\u00a0</p>\n<p>When Seungcheol began courting him and Jimin quickly learned what the pack really thought of him, most of those dreams faded away. Still, he finds it hard to wear the coat made by Jungkook, knowing he will never have that.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He\u2019s outside picking sticks for firewood with Jungkook a few feet away doing the same when they smell it - something unfamiliar, drifting down with the wind. They stiffen, and Jungkook barks, \u201cBack inside.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin doesn\u2019t think to argue. He runs back into the cave, heart thudding in his chest. The foreign scents grow stronger - alphas, maybe three or four of them, all rogues. They don\u2019t carry the telltale mix of scents that comes from those with a pack. Jimin retreats to the back corner of the cave, hunting around for something he can use as a weapon. He weighs a hefty rock in his hand and holds onto it.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He hears Jungkook call, \u201cStep closer and I\u2019ll treat it as a breach of my territory.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCome now,\u201d responds another voice. \u201cWe only want to talk.\u201d</p>\n<p>A growl, the snap of teeth. \u201cOne more step.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jungkook\u2019s warning isn\u2019t heeded; Jimin hears two bodies slam together, hears the skid of paws on dirt. His heart thuds frantically in his chest, and he moves until his back hits the cave wall. A shadow falls across the floor; an alpha stands in the entryway, large and hulking, a glint in his eyes.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jimin lifts the rock in warning. \u201cDon\u2019t come near me.\u201d</p>\n<p>The alpha sniffs the air in interest and takes a step forward. \u201cHe\u2019s gone and kidnapped a pack omega? That\u2019s low, even for him.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m warning you. Stay away from me.\u201d</p>\n<p>The alpha moves quickly. Jimin anticipates it; he strips off his clothes just as the alpha does, shifting form to meet him in a clash halfway into the cave. The alpha\u2019s wolf is bigger, of course, and like Jungkook, he is a battle-hardened rogue. Jimin can hold his own, has to, but he never really learned how to fight.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jimin lands a nasty gash on the alpha\u2019s hind leg, but in the end the rogue overpowers him and drags him from the cave with his teeth in his neck. The alpha tosses him into the fray, pinning him down, and a high-pitched whine builds in the back of Jimin\u2019s throat. Jungkook is taking on the two other alphas by himself, and he\u2019s vicious - glinting teeth and wide jaw, quick paws and powerful hind legs.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jungkook growls at the sight of Jimin, flinging one of the wolves off him and diving for the one holding Jimin down. Another sinks her teeth into Jungkook\u2019s leg, dragging him back, but Jungkook is persistent, tearing himself away and slamming into the alpha holding Jimin down.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jimin squirms away, leaping to his feet and skidding in the way of the wolf who tries to follow Jungkook. He swipes at his muzzle, leaving a nasty gash in his wake, and jumps onto the wolf before he can gather his bearings. The other comes for him, but then Jungkook is in their way, his teeth sinking into the alpha\u2019s neck. He tears her throat out in a spray of blood.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jimin recoils, seeing that the wolf who had held Jimin down is dead, too. Only one remains. Jungkook bares his bloodied teeth, but the last wolf is already running away. Jimin sinks to the ground, ears flat on his head in a gesture of submission. Jungkook pads toward him, shaking off the blood, and noses at Jimin\u2019s head. Jimin whines, and Jungkook huffs. He laps at the wound in Jimin\u2019s neck where the alpha had sunk his teeth, his tongue rough and warm.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Then he moves away, padding back to the cave, shifting on the way.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWe have to move,\u201d he calls over his shoulder. \u201cMore will come.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin rises and follows.\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u2744</p>\n<p>Every step they travel takes them farther away from Jimin\u2019s pack land, but Jimin argues no further. After their encounter with the rogues, the last thing he wants to do is enter the wild smelling of Jungkook. He will not survive.</p>\n<p>They stop only at night, when they fix a meal together and catch a few hours of sleep. Jungkook sleeps far less than Jimin does; he wakes throughout the night to keep watch, and he never asks Jimin to take a turn. Jimin is so on edge that he wakes whenever he feels Jungkook stir, anyway.\u00a0</p>\n<p>When the meat Jungkook had gathered during Jimin\u2019s heat runs out, he begins to hunt for them again. He hesitates at leaving Jimin alone, and at first, they go together. But there are things to take care of at camp, and it isn\u2019t efficient for both of them to hunt each night. Rather than send Jimin off alone, Jungkook starts to leave him, scent marking their camp thoroughly and never straying too far. Jimin is afraid when he\u2019s alone.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Then he starts to feel restless.</p>\n<p>For a wolf raised in a pack, breaking from those bonds is almost physically painful. Jimin misses his pack desperately. He knows it would be foolish to leave, that there are other rogues out there, but he begins to feel like the risk is worth it. He can\u2019t live as Jungkook\u2019s prisoner forever. One day, he will have to go home.</p>\n<p>And if he dies in the process, then it is what the goddess of the moon has woven for him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>So Jimin plans, quietly. He knows he can find his way by the stars and the moss, though he is still in unfamiliar territory, and it won\u2019t be easy. He hides dry food in the lining of his coat, and he pays close attention to where they are and how Jungkook decides where they go next. And at last the time comes, one dusky evening when Jungkook says he will be gone hunting for longer than usual.</p>\n<p>\u201cPrey is scarce here,\u201d he tells him. \u201cStill, I won\u2019t go far. If I smell anything, I will return.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin nods and sets to prepping some herbs and tending to the fire.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jungkook leaves, and Jimin waits, and waits, and waits. Then he fetches the hidden snow brush he had made from wood and sage, rubs the herbs all over his body to disguise his scent, and begins to run.</p>\n<p>He brushes snow over his tracks as he moves, restraining himself from running too fast lest he disturb the ground in a way that cannot be concealed. He uses the stars to guide him north.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He travels for little under an hour when he begins to pick up on the scent of another wolf. He clamps down on his fear, not wanting his own scent to spike, and sheds his clothes quickly. Shifting into his wolf form, he uses his heightened senses to take stock of his surroundings. It\u2019s a rogue, an alpha, and Jimin can\u2019t hold the fear back any longer.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He takes his clothes in his mouth, hackles rising as he surveys the woods around him. The snow glitters in the light of the moon, and he hears the rustle of a smaller animal in the distance. A branch snaps. A whine builds in the back of Jimin\u2019s throat; he backs away, crouching close to the ground, ready to flee but afraid that will only inspire the rogue to give chase.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Then his nose picks up on another, far more familiar scent: cinnamon and clove.</p>\n<p>Jimin turns around and runs.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He hears a growl, the snap of teeth, and the skid of paws in the snow. Jimin\u2019s heart thuds hard, his panting loud and harsh in the quiet of the nighttime woods. He\u2019s small and fast, has always been known for his speed, but it isn\u2019t enough. He can feel the heat of the body behind him, feel the snow spraying against his legs as the distance between them closes. Teeth snap at his hind legs and he pushes himself harder, runs faster -\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jungkook leaps, and his teeth sink into Jimin\u2019s neck.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jimin flops to the side, trying to throw him off, but Jungkook is stronger and far bigger than him. Jimin spins, skidding in the snow, and Jungkook drags him back by the neck, pinning him down with his full weight. His struggles are useless, and Jimin gives in, a low growl coming from him as he lies there, ears flicking in frustration.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jungkook\u2019s teeth snap by his ear and he yips. Jimin knows what he means. He wriggles until Jungkook lets him go enough for him to shift back into his human form. He reaches for his coat, tugging it over his body to protect him from the snow. Jungkook shifts, too, but he has no clothes to reach for. He doesn\u2019t look like he cares. He crouches in the snow, jaw set in anger.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDid you set out to die tonight?\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin turns his face away from him, burying his hands in his coat.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you not understand?\u201d His voice is as harsh a growl while human as it was wolf. \u201cThey will kill you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThen let me die!\u201d Jimin bursts. He is shivering, but his body feels aflame. \u201cI would rather die than be packless.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jungkook stares at him for a long moment, his dark eyes glittering. Then he rises, snatching Jimin\u2019s clothes off the ground. \u201cCome,\u201d he says, wrapping his hand around Jimin\u2019s nape and pulling him to his feet. \u201cThey are coming for us. We must move.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin hates his wolf for the way it submits instinctually to Jungkook\u2019s grip, falling limp in his hold. He wraps the coat tighter around himself, trembling, and lets Jungkook lead him back to the camp.\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u2744</p>\n<p>Jimin comes down with a fever.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He writhes in the night, first wracked with chills and then drenched in sweat. Jungkook wakes him in the middle of the night, when he has returned to violent shivers, and forces him to shed his heavy coat and blanket. Jimin protests, trembling in the cold, but the lucid part of him knows they must bring the fever down.</p>\n<p>\u201cAre all pack wolves so weak?\u201d Jungkook asks, bringing him a cup of white willow bark tea. \u201cOne night in the snow, and already you\u2019ve taken ill.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin ignores him. He drinks the tea, begins to sweat, and falls into a fitful sleep. The next time he wakes, Jungkook sits by his side, pressing a cold, wet rag to his forehead.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy are you doing this?\u201d Jimin slurs. \u201cWhy does it matter to you if I die?\u201d</p>\n<p>Jungkook looks away, dark hair falling in his eyes, and Jimin thinks he won\u2019t answer and the confused turmoil in his chest will never ease. Then Jungkook looks back and says, \u201cI killed your father. I owe you a debt.\u201d</p>\n<p>It is an answer that Jimin can understand - one that he can make peace with. The spilling of blood always requires a sacrifice in return. Jungkook must have spilled the blood of many; his debts must be countless. The opportunity to relieve one of them must not come often. The turmoil eases, and Jimin sleeps once more.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He\u2019s lucky that he is young and strong; his fever breaks in only a day. It leaves him feeling weak and disoriented, but Jungkook is restless to keep moving, especially after smelling the rogues. He has food for Jimin to regain his strength when he next wakes, and Jimin eats quietly, furs wrapped tightly around himself, while Jungkook prepares for them to leave.</p>\n<p>\u201cIf my pack is dead like you think,\u201d Jimin says, \u201cthen you should let me die, too. I would release you from your debt.\u201d</p>\n<p>For a moment, Jungkook doesn\u2019t look at him, his jaw tightening. Then abruptly he sits on a stump across from where Jimin eats and looks him dead in the eye.</p>\n<p>\u201cThere is a place at a three days\u2019 run from here. It is a safe space for rogues, of sorts. There are rules, and blood cannot be spilled.\u201d Jungkook pauses, as if considering his words. \u201cIf there is any news of your pack, we will hear it there.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin blinks, afraid to hope. \u201cWill you take me there?\u201d</p>\n<p>Jungkook nods. \u201cI will take you. And if the news is as I suspect, then you will have to accept your new fate.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin nods, eager.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cBut I will warn you,\u201d Jungkook says, voice hard, \u201cthat after you are seen with me there, you will never be safe again.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin swallows. It\u2019s worth it. \u201cI understand.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u2744</p>\n<p>They reach the encampment after three days of travel, just as Jungkook anticipated. His tensions rise the nearer they grow, and on the third day, he refuses to stop even for a moment. When Jimin grows too weary to continue, he tells him to shift and slings his human body onto his back, carrying him the rest of the way. For seven leagues in every direction encircling the rogue encampment, no blood can be spilled. Only once they are within its boundaries does Jungkook relax at last.\u00a0</p>\n<p>They stop for a much-needed meal, and then they continue on. Jimin begins to pick up on a medley of scents as they near: meat cooking, savory vegetables, the scent of numerous rogue alphas and omegas both. After days without the scent of others, the sudden assault is almost too much for him. He has to bury his nose into his furs for comfort.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The noises grow clearer the nearer they get, too, clinking dishes and the braying of animals and distant voices. Jimin finds himself shrinking into Jungkook\u2019s side on instinct. Jungkook isn\u2019t as tense as before, but he still looks wary, taking up more space as he walks, his scent flaring in defensiveness. The bracelet around his wrist feels almost like a brand, and Jimin finds himself wishing that he didn\u2019t have it.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jungkook, given how little he speaks, doesn\u2019t bother explaining how the camp works or where he is walking to with such purpose. Jimin soaks it in with wide eyes. The tents are far more temporary than those of Jimin\u2019s pack, clearly made to be dismantled easily and often. There are more people than he expected, too, alphas and omegas and even a few betas. He catches two other people with ranking bracelets, a number 10 and a number 19. Jimin wonders how many ranks are required to wear the bracelets. He wonders if that means Jungkook killed 19 people to wear his own.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jimin isn\u2019t the only one staring. The others stare back, turning their noses in his direction, perhaps still smelling the remnants of his pack on him. But mostly they stare at Jungkook and the red number one on his wrist. He does not look back. He walks like he cannot feel the stares at all.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jungkook stops before a tent that looks far more durable than the others, made of animal pelts like those of Jimin\u2019s pack. He announces his presence outside, voice loud and clear. \u201cJungkook, Alpha, First Rank.\u201d</p>\n<p>For a moment, no one answers. Then -\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd who is with you, Jungkook of the First Rank?\u201d</p>\n<p>The voice crackles with age. Jungkook looks at Jimin, and Jimin clears his throat. \u201cPark Jimin, Omega, of the Choi Pack.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cEnter.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jungkook holds open the flap and nods for Jimin to enter first. Jimin ducks inside, his boots sinking into plush carpet, and finds a woman sitting on a pile of cushions before them. She is as ancient as she sounds, her face lined with age, a long plait of silver hair falling into her lap. Her scent is so marred with age that Jimin can\u2019t tell if she is an alpha, omega, or beta. He waits in the entrance while Jungkook steps up next to him, letting the flap close behind him, the only light left streaming in from the open smoke flaps.</p>\n<p>\u201cRemove your shoes and sit.\u201d</p>\n<p>They leave their boots by the door and fold themselves on cushions opposite her. She turns her head toward Jimin. Her eyes are cloudy.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou are the first pack omega to enter our encampment.\u201d</p>\n<p>Unsure of how to respond, Jimin inclines his head in respect. She doesn\u2019t seem to expect an answer.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cFor what purpose do you seek refuge here?\u201d</p>\n<p>Jungkook answers, \u201cWe seek news regarding the Choi Pack.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFor how many days and nights will you be here?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo more than four,\u201d Jungkook says, \u201calthough we may only be here for one.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe have one empty tent. Will you take it?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, Elder Kim.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cRemember that no blood will be spilled within our boundaries. Break the rule, and you will be killed.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin\u2019s heart stutters in his chest.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWe understand,\u201d Jungkook says.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe pack omega must speak for himself.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI understand,\u201d Jimin echoes, and his voice comes out weaker than he intends.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThen we welcome you.\u201d</p>\n<p>It\u2019s a dismissal, and Jungkook rises, slipping back into his shoes. Jimin follows him out, blinking against the sun, and finds a group of alphas hovering around the tent, waiting for them. The one at the forefront eyes Jungkook\u2019s bracelet with a frightening sort of hunger.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cLook at that,\u201d he says, licking his lips. \u201cNumber one, right here in front of us.\u201d</p>\n<p>He bows in mockery, and someone laughs. The alpha standing next to him looks Jimin up and down in a way that makes him cringe.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd with a pack omega, too,\u201d she says. \u201cThat\u2019s low, even for you, Number One.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jungkook doesn\u2019t even bother answering them. He growls, low and threatening, baring his teeth. Then he puts a hand on the back of Jimin\u2019s neck, grip light but firm, and steers him along ahead of him. The warning is clear: Jimin is Jungkook\u2019s. The alphas part and let them pass, but Jimin can feel their stares like they are tangible.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jungkook\u2019s hand is rough and calloused against Jimin\u2019s bare skin. The nape is a sensitive place, especially for an omega. His knees feel a little weak. He fights to keep them from buckling and hopes Jungkook hasn\u2019t picked up on the change in his scent. For a moment, Jimin\u2019s omega fools itself into thinking he really is Jungkook\u2019s.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jungkook only lets him go when they stop before the empty tent, marked with a green cloth. He removes it and enters first. Jimin had been worried it would smell like strangers, but the tent only smells like herbs. Jungkook puts his things down and begins to scent it almost immediately, brushing his shoulders along the parameter.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jimin doesn\u2019t quite know what to do. He still feels unsettled, by the foreign scents and the alphas\u2019 attention and Jungkook\u2019s hand, rough on his neck. He sits down heavily in the middle of the tent. Jungkook finishes and sits across from him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThings are different here,\u201d he says. \u201cIt would be best if you do not leave my side.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin nods. After the encounter with the alphas, the last thing he wants to do is go off on his own.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThey hold communal meals here on some nights. I would rather we find our own food, but meals are the best place to find information.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin nods. \u201cThen we\u2019ll go.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jungkook fidgets, looking like he wants to say something. Jimin waits, and finally -\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI need to check if someone is here. But I don\u2019t want to leave you alone.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI will come with you.\u201d</p>\n<p>He tightens his furs and stands, stepping outside with Jungkook at his heels. Jungkook steers him toward the other tents, and they walk past while Jungkook peers closely at each. He stops at a tent with a red and gold cloth tucked into the flap.</p>\n<p>\u201cHold on,\u201d he says, stepping up to announce himself before ducking his head inside.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jimin waits, nose twitching, peering curiously at a pair of rogue omegas tending to a fire outside a nearby tent. There aren\u2019t nearly as many rogue omegas as there are alphas; alphas tend to be banished more frequently, and when packs are forced into others, the omegas are usually kept.\u00a0</p>\n<p>An alpha scent hits Jimin\u2019s nose, and his hackles rise at the potency of it just as someone yips right by his ear.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He jumps, spinning around and stumbling, and he feels arms around his waist, hears laughter by his ear. His scent spikes with fear. The alpha has a bracelet with a row of canines and a number 10.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cLet me go.\u201d Jimin pushes at his chest, but it\u2019s like hitting a wall of stone, and he just keeps laughing.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cPretty little omega,\u201d he croons, wicked gaze flickering all over Jimin\u2019s face. \u201cYou scare so easily.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jungkook\u2019s scent overwhelms him, accompanied by a low, vicious snarl. Jungkook fists a hand in the back of Jimin\u2019s coat and yanks him bodily from the alpha\u2019s arms. Jimin stumbles back, wrapping protective arms around himself. Jungkook is still snarling, a sound that grows deeper, coming from his chest, as he gets right up in the alpha\u2019s face.\u00a0</p>\n<p>His scent is deep and musky and Jimin finds his own spiking in response, his knees weak again. Jungkook and the alpha growl in each other\u2019s faces, fists clenched, chests puffed. Jungkook fakes forward like he\u2019s going to strike, and the alpha flinches back. It\u2019s won. Jungkook snaps his teeth once for good measure then turns back to Jimin. The alpha slinks off, fury and humiliation seeping off him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cTake your furs off,\u201d Jungkook snaps. Jimin blinks at him, confused, but Jungkook is still angry and impatient, and he insists, \u201cTake them off.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin does, and Jungkook removes his own and thrusts them at Jimin. He snatches Jimin\u2019s from his hand.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cPut them on.\u201d His mouth is tight, and Jimin doesn\u2019t dare stall. He slips into Jungkook\u2019s furs, feels like he is swimming in them, but the scent is what really gets to him. It\u2019s heady, and his belly clenches. He has to fight the instinct to bury his nose in them.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jungkook puts his hand back on Jimin\u2019s nape and marches them to their tent. Jimin\u2019s skin feels hot, his heart ready to beat right out of his chest, and he prays to the moon that he won\u2019t do something humiliating like begin to leak slick.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYour scent,\u201d Jungkook\u2019s muttering, more to himself than anything, \u201c\u2018s too much. Don\u2019t smell enough like me.\u201d</p>\n<p>When they return to the tent, Jungkook immediately begins to scent Jimin\u2019s furs, rubbing them right against his neck. Jimin retreats to a corner and tries to breathe through his mouth, but it doesn\u2019t help. He can taste Jungkook\u2019s scent on his tongue.</p>\n<p>\u201cDid he hurt you?\u201d Jungkook demands after a moment. Some of the rawness of his scent has mellowed out, and the wild haze in his eyes has calmed.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jimin shakes his head. \u201cNo. Thank you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t thank me,\u201d he mutters. \u201cShouldn\u2019t have let you out of my sight. Here.\u201d He tosses the freshly scented furs at him. \u201cTrade back.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin shrugs out of Jungkook\u2019s coat and takes a welcome breath of air before he has to put his own back on and drown in Jungkook\u2019s scent all over again.\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u2744</p>\n<p>Dinner is busy.\u00a0</p>\n<p>In Jimin\u2019s pack, meals had been a very structured affair. They showed up on time or nothing; the adults ate first, then the children. They stood in line and everyone\u2019s portions were given according to age and need. Then everyone sat around the fire and ate together, often accompanied by a story or a song.</p>\n<p>This is not like that.</p>\n<p>This is everyone clamoring to get at two massive pots by the fire, doling what they want into their own dishes; Jimin sees steel pots and painted pottery and even an old piece of cloth. It makes sense, he supposes; you can only have so much structure among a group of strangers.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The crowd makes Jimin nervous, and he hovers by Jungkook\u2019s side. Some of the alphas they pass growl in Jimin\u2019s direction, one of them going so far as to rub his scent gland, despite the way Jungkook snarls back every time. Jungkook is agitated, a hand firmly on the small of Jimin\u2019s back, gaze flickering over the mob around the pots when they stop a little ways away. Jimin sees the dilemma: Jungkook doesn\u2019t want to take Jimin into the crowd, but if they wait too long, they might not get anything to eat at all.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll wait on that stump,\u201d Jimin suggests, gesturing to the stump of a long-forgotten oak. \u201cYou go.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jungkook looks conflicted. He chews on his lip, then finally says, \u201cI won\u2019t take my eyes off you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin nods and waves him off. He goes over to perch on the stump, wrapping his arms around his knees. He can already feel eyes on him, though he doesn\u2019t dare look back. He doesn\u2019t understand what it is about this place. Jimin knows he is pretty, that his scent is sweet and attractive - he has used those facts to his advantage before. But that doesn\u2019t explain the relentlessness of the attention he has been receiving.\u00a0</p>\n<p>A heavy pair of boots comes into Jimin\u2019s vision. \u201cHello,\u201d comes the voice above him. Jimin looks up. The alpha is smiling and handsome. \u201cIs it true you are a pack omega?\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin\u2019s scent spikes, and the alpha holds his palms out.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI just want to talk. It isn\u2019t often you see someone with a pack around here.\u201d He lowers his voice and makes a show of glancing around himself. \u201cDid he bring you by force? Because if so, my tent has extra room - \u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin smells Jungkook before he sees him, raw and intense.</p>\n<p>\u201cPiss off,\u201d he growls, right behind the other alpha, who spins around.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe were just talking.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jungkook snarls, lips curling around his teeth, and the alpha shrugs and walks off.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cFucking ridiculous,\u201d Jungkook mutters, folding himself onto the ground next to Jimin. He hands him the bowl that contains markedly more food. \u201cI will have to drown you in my scent.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin flushes. His omega wants to curl toward Jungkook, and the rest of him wants to curl away in embarrassment. \u201cI don\u2019t understand,\u201d he mumbles. \u201cWhy won\u2019t they leave me alone?\u201d</p>\n<p>Jungkook is glaring at him, agitated again, and Jimin thinks he can tell now that he isn\u2019t upset <em> with </em> him necessarily. He takes a bite of his food, and Jungkook relaxes almost immediately, turning his attention to his own food.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI mean, there are other omegas here,\u201d Jimin points out. Being an omega, Jimin has definitely been on the receiving end of unwanted alpha attention many times before. But it has never happened with the intensity and frequency that it seems to be happening here. Things were far more controlled in his pack.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, but you are from a pack.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI still don\u2019t understand,\u201d he admits.\u00a0</p>\n<p>To his surprise, Jungkook looks almost embarrassed. He sniffs and avoids Jimin\u2019s gaze. \u201cPack mating, uh, works different.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin frowns, not following.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou spend your ruts and heats alone until you are mated, yes?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh.\u201d Jimin\u2019s cheeks flame with sudden heat as he understands. \u201c<em> Oh </em>.\u201d They\u2019re after him because he is a virgin.\u00a0</p>\n<p>An uncomfortable silence follows.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t like that for everyone,\u201d Jimin grumbles. He knows of packs much less strict than his; not everyone spends their cycles in isolation.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cBut it is for you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin\u2019s cheeks flame hotter. \u201cHow do you know?\u201d he demands.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jungkook looks at him like he\u2019s stupid. \u201cYour scent.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin really does curl into himself this time, squirming with embarrassment. \u201cI don\u2019t like this conversation.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou asked,\u201d Jungkook huffs. He transfers some of the food from his bowl into Jimin\u2019s, as if to say, <em> eat more, talk less </em>.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDid you hear anything about my pack?\u201d</p>\n<p>Jungkook nods. His lips twist. \u201cThey have been absorbed by the Yoo Clan.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin\u2019s stomach rolls with nausea. He sets his bowl down, no longer hungry. He knows what that means. He can tell by the tightness in Jungkook\u2019s jaw that he knows, too. His mother, and Sana, and Taehyung, and all the people he loves - Jimin turns away, fighting the urge to dry heave.\u00a0</p>\n<p>But they\u2019re alive. He holds onto that fact with desperate certainty. They\u2019re alive.</p>\n<p>\u201cThere is a rumor,\u201d Jungkook starts, \u201cthat the Yoo Clan\u2019s Alpha has put out a bounty on your intended.\u201d</p>\n<p>Seungcheol made it out, then. Jimin\u2019s heart clenches. If he made it out, there\u2019s a chance that some of the others did, too. There\u2019s a chance that he will go back for them. Whatever Jimin\u2019s qualms with Seungcheol are, he could never doubt his love for the pack. He would die for them. \u201cHe is not my intended,\u201d Jimin mumbles, because he finds it easier to focus on that than anything else.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jungkook doesn\u2019t look like he believes him. \u201cSo, what now?\u201d</p>\n<p>And that is the question. What now? Jimin doesn\u2019t know. Returning to join his pack as part of the Yoo Clan would be foolish. He certainly cannot rescue his loved ones on his own. And what\u2019s the alternative - for Jimin to remain packless?\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI do not know,\u201d Jimin says.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He expects Jungkook to scoff at him, but he only nods. \u201cSleep on it,\u201d he says. \u201cWe have time to stay here.\u201d</p>\n<p>He pushes Jimin\u2019s bowl back at him, insistent, and Jimin takes a bite that tastes like lead in his mouth. He looks out at the crowd, which has started to thin out, and wonders if this will be his life now. Jungkook won\u2019t protect him forever. Jimin doesn\u2019t want to be alone - can\u2019t be. He thrives on the presence of others.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He would die alone.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s an alpha staring at him, leering. Jimin catches his gaze by accident. He looks away quickly, afraid, and finds Jungkook looking at him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to be afraid. If they try to hurt you, I\u2019ll kill them.\u201d</p>\n<p>It\u2019s matter-of-fact. Still, Jimin feels warm, flushed, can\u2019t quite meet Jungkook\u2019s eyes. He casts his gaze downward. The intensity of Jungkook\u2019s gaze on him drives away the discomfort of the stranger\u2019s. \u201cYou can\u2019t spill blood here,\u201d he mumbles.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll drag them out of the boundaries and kill them there.\u201d</p>\n<p>The bracelet of canines on his wrist clacks, as if a reminder. Jimin believes him. He would do it.</p>\n<p>Jungkook\u2019s glaring at the alpha now. He glares at him until he looks away, then he shifts his body so that he\u2019s blocking Jimin from view.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cLet\u2019s go back to the tent,\u201d Jimin says softly. \u201cI\u2019m tired.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jungkook nods. He takes both their bowls and rises, letting Jimin lead the way so he can follow with a watchful eye. Just before they enter the tent, Jimin catches a whiff of a scent that feels vaguely familiar: sandalwood and a hint of pine. Jimin frowns, entering the tent with Jungkook, and wonders why the scent feels so familiar. Jungkook sets their food down and begins to unroll their bedrolls.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Normally, they sleep across the fire from each other, but today Jungkook places their bedrolls side-by-side. He pauses when he feels Jimin watching, looking up from where he crouches. \u201cIt would be better,\u201d he starts, \u201cif I slept by you here.\u201d</p>\n<p>The strike of fear comes with Jungkook\u2019s implication. He nods, slipping out of his furs and sitting atop his bedroll. These tents aren\u2019t built to hold fires, and it\u2019s cold, but not enough that he can\u2019t bear it. Jungkook remains crouched, looking agitated again, like he wants to say something but doesn\u2019t know how.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Jimin presses, and Jungkook looks almost startled at being caught.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI, uh - \u201d He clears his throat. \u201cCan you finish your food?\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin stares at him. \u201cFinish my food?\u201d</p>\n<p>Jungkook nods roughly, looking away. Jimin blinks. The realization dawns on him slowly. It\u2019s obvious, looking back on the events of the day - and the days before, too, if Jimin thinks hard enough. Jungkook\u2019s alpha is treating Jimin as his own.</p>\n<p>Jimin\u2019s cheeks feel hot again. He scoots over to reach for his bowl and starts to finish it off. Jungkook relaxes, stripping his own furs off and settling down. He watches Jimin eat, though Jimin can tell he\u2019s trying not to be too obvious about it. When Jimin\u2019s done, Jungkook lets out a satisfied rumble and takes the bowl from him. He sets it aside and lies down. Jimin does the same, though he feels a little awkward about it, given that he\u2019s shoulder-to-shoulder with Jungkook.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI should - \u201d Jungkook starts, hesitating. \u201cI should hold you. Just in case.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin frowns at the roof of the tent. His stomach rolls at the thought of Jungkook\u2019s fear being so great that he thinks someone might come into their tent and snatch Jimin away while he sleeps, so great that he feels like he needs to hold him through the night for safety.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not trying to be underhanded,\u201d Jungkook adds, and he sounds genuinely concerned that Jimin might think that\u2019s the case.</p>\n<p>\u201cI know,\u201d Jimin mumbles, and he does. Jungkook doesn\u2019t seem like the type. He turns onto his side, back to Jungkook, and says, \u201cGo ahead.\u201d</p>\n<p>The way Jungkook wraps an arm around Jimin\u2019s waist is tentative. Then his grip grows firmer, his chest pressing against Jimin\u2019s back. Jimin can feel his nose in his hair. He tries to relax in his hold, knows there\u2019s no use being tense, but Jungkook\u2019s scent is strong and overwhelming as always, and a shiver runs up his spine unbidden. He wonders, briefly, if Jungkook\u2019s ever as affected by his scent as he is by Jungkook\u2019s.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cGoodnight,\u201d Jimin whispers, and Jungkook\u2019s silent. He thinks he isn\u2019t going to answer, but then -\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cGoodnight.\u201d The word is a soft rumble through his chest, and Jimin can feel it against his body.\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u2744</p>\n<p>Jimin wakes violently. Someone\u2019s calling his name.</p>\n<p>\u201cPark Jimin!\u201d he hears, echoing outside the tent. \u201cJimin, where are you?\u201d</p>\n<p>Jungkook\u2019s still wrapped tightly around him. Jimin shifts, and his grip only tightens, a low rumble coming from his chest.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cPark Jimin!\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin knows that voice. And, as he begins to realize, he knows that scent he\u2019d caught last night, too. Of course he knows that scent. Jimin pushes at Jungkook\u2019s arm, but it\u2019s like trying to move stone.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cJungkook,\u201d he hisses. \u201cWake up.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jungkook\u2019s eyes fly open, a growl beginning to form in his throat, eyes flickering around them as he searches for a threat. Jimin uses the opportunity to shove him off, leaping to his feet and dashing from the tent. He\u2019d slept in his boots and coat, cold as it was, and he holds his furs tight around himself now as he runs through the camp, following the scent of sandalwood and pine. The cold cuts into the skin of his face as he runs, feels like knives in his head, but Jimin doesn\u2019t slow down. He ducks past a crew of alphas who growl after him, their scents spiking in interest.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Then he sees him: standing in the middle of a pair of tents, hands cupped around his mouth, is a face Jimin had almost begun to think he would never see again.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAlpha Yoongi!\u201d he cries, launching himself at him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Yoongi melts with relief, clutching at Jimin\u2019s furs as Jimin clutches at his, nosing under his jaw to lightly scent him. Jimin breathes in the familiar scent of Yoongi, of his pack, and blinks back tears.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI knew I caught your scent,\u201d Yoongi says, a comforting rumble in his chest. Jimin pulls back to look at him, the tears welling up despite his best efforts to quell them. \u201cI thought we\u2019d lost you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI thought I\u2019d lost you, too.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy do you smell like that?\u201d Yoongi asks, nosing once more at Jimin\u2019s neck to confirm.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jimin is in the midst of trying to figure out how to explain when Yoongi looks behind him and begins to snarl.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou,\u201d he snaps, letting Jimin go and surging forward with intent.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jimin spins around and sees Jungkook, who\u2019s instantly on the defense.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou took him,\u201d Yoongi growls, and goes to fist a hand in Jungkook\u2019s collar.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jungkook doesn\u2019t bother trying to defend himself. He grabs Yoongi\u2019s wrist before he can touch him and twists. Yoongi goes for his neck with his free hand, and then it\u2019s a full-out brawl. Jimin backs away, a whine of distress building in the back of his throat. He knows better than to get in the middle of an alpha fight, though; they need to follow through. He just hopes neither of them are foolish enough to draw blood.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Despite his distress, Jimin can\u2019t help the way his omega reacts to the fight, given how closely tied it is to him. His knees feel weak and his mind hazy, his own scent responding with interest. He finds his gaze caught on the corded muscles of Jungkook\u2019s forearms, the tendons that tighten in his neck. Yoongi is no easy opponent either, quick and smart, the type who doesn\u2019t hesitate to fight dirty.\u00a0</p>\n<p>But Jungkook lives a far different life than any pack alpha, and Jimin can see who\u2019s going to win.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIs this a fight for your hand?\u201d comes a voice beside Jimin. It\u2019s the alpha from mealtime, the one who had offered Jimin a place in his tent. \u201cShould I join the fray?\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin moves away. There are other alphas watching the fight, too, feeding off the energy, but they\u2019re all focused on Jungkook and Yoongi, not on him. He turns his back on him, sending a message, but the alpha reaches out and takes his hand. Jimin freezes, heart thudding painfully hard in his chest. He wants to twist his hand out of his grip, but no one\u2019s watching them. It would be easy for things to escalate.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Then Jungkook and Yoongi are by his side, fight forgotten, their instinctual anger turned on the alpha. Jungkook rips the stranger\u2019s hand away by the wrist, hard enough that Jimin thinks he might hear a bone snap. Yoongi growls at him, posturing, and the alpha hisses in response.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cJimin!\u201d someone calls. \u201cAlpha Yoongi!\u201d</p>\n<p>Seungcheol and Namjoon are running toward them. Jimin has no time to register the joy and relief at seeing them alive because they\u2019re picking up on a threat to their pack, on Yoongi\u2019s anger, and turning on the alpha.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cEnough.\u201d</p>\n<p>Elder Kim\u2019s voice is not a shout, but it carries. Silence falls. She stands outside her tent, leaning on a walking stick, there to intervene now that what was just a fight between two alphas has potentially turned into something greater. Jimin\u2019s pack pulls back, and the alpha spins on his heel and shoves away through the crowd.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Then Elder Kim turns her cloudy gaze on Jimin, and his heart skips a beat. \u201cIf you keep causing trouble, Omega, your welcome will be rescinded.\u201d</p>\n<p>She turns around and walks back into her tent.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jimin bristles, hackles rising. It isn\u2019t his fault every alpha in the damn camp thinks only with their knot. But he has other concerns to address, so he swallows his anger and turns to the others.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHe saved me,\u201d Jimin blurts, because they\u2019re all still glaring at each other, and Jimin has to get in the way of it before it turns into instinct again. \u201cJungkook. He saved me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Namjoon is the first one to come to his senses. He frowns at Jimin, though his eyes are still locked on Jungkook. \u201cExplain.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI was in heat. I left the others so I wouldn\u2019t draw attention to them. He found me and kept me safe. He brought me here so I could look for you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Namjoon begins to relax. Seungcheol and Yoongi still look doubtful, but their postures ease enough to no longer come off as threats.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThen we owe you a debt,\u201d Seungcheol says, albeit stiffly.</p>\n<p>Jungkook shakes his head, looking uncomfortable with the thought of it. \u201cIt was Jimin I owed a debt to. I was only fulfilling my duty.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou must tell me what has happened,\u201d Jimin says. \u201cHow have you come to be here? Where is everyone else?\u201d</p>\n<p>Namjoon nods. \u201cWe will talk. Come - we\u2019ve set up camp not far from here.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jungkook takes a step back. \u201cI will return to the tent, Jimin, and leave you in their hands.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin\u2019s omega feels discontented. Still, it\u2019s the most logical response, so he nods. Jungkook gives him one last look before he turns around and walks off.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cCome,\u201d Seungcheol says, and Jimin follows.</p>\n<p>They\u2019ve set up their own camp away from the hustle and bustle of the main one. Hoseok is waiting there, and he greets Jimin with a joyous howl, scenting him far more thoroughly than Yoongi had dared. Hoseok has never been shy with affection.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy do you smell like a rogue alpha?\u201d His nose twitches, a flicker of concern passing over his gaze.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYour story first,\u201d Jimin insists. \u201cI want to know what happened. My mother - Aunt Kyungri - \u201c</p>\n<p>He\u2019s beginning to grow distressed again. Yoongi steers him toward a log by the fire and sits him down, and the rest of them crowd around. Seungcheol is the first to begin.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe were outnumbered,\u201d he says. \u201cUnprepared. We didn\u2019t stand a chance.\u201d</p>\n<p>That\u2019s a difficult thing for an alpha to admit, but Seungcheol does it with grace and a hint of sorrow.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSome of the omegas managed to escape with the children, but they caught most of them in the end. Dragged them back to camp, where they had the rest of us. They killed my father. They would have killed me, too, but Namjoon pulled me from my rage and found a way for us to escape. We were able to get to Hoseok and Yoongi, too.\u201d</p>\n<p>It can\u2019t have been easy, running away when all their instincts would have been screaming at them to protect their pack. But it was the smarter decision in the long run. Had they stayed, they would have been killed undoubtedly. All four of them are far too high-ranking to simply banish.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re rogues now,\u201d Seungcheol acknowledges. \u201cIt took us time to learn, but we found our way here eventually.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Jimin murmurs, sadness weighing on his heart. He had known Alpha Dakho since he was a child. Admired and respected him up until Seungcheol\u2019s courting changed things. \u201cAbout your father.\u201d</p>\n<p>He nods. The ensuing silence is heavy. Their Pack Alpha had his flaws, but mostly he had been well-liked.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWho else did we lose?\u201d The words are difficult to get out, but Jimin knows he must ask.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s a list longer than Jimin wants to hear - mostly alphas, two of the elders, one of their omegas. Jimin grows dizzier with grief as each name is spoken. He wonders how he will bear such a weight. His eyes fill with tears, and Namjoon rests a heavy hand on his shoulder. The four of them have been carrying this weight for so long already.\u00a0</p>\n<p>None of his family\u2019s names are spoken, nor Taehyung\u2019s, and he\u2019s ashamed of the relief he feels when they finish the names.</p>\n<p>\u201cThere are more alive than dead,\u201d Yoongi says, a quiet reassurance.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Seungcheol sighs long and low. \u201cYour turn, Jimin. Omega Taehyung had told us you ran to save them. You were very brave.\u201d</p>\n<p>The lump in Jimin\u2019s throat hurts. He doesn\u2019t feel brave.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe assumed you had been taken by someone else when they never brought you back with them.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cJungkook took me,\u201d Jimin says. \u201cBut only to save me. I wanted to go back and find you when it was over, but he wouldn\u2019t let me. It would have been dangerous. I didn\u2019t - I didn\u2019t quite understand at first. But now that I\u2019m here, seeing what his rank really means, I think I understand.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat debt did he speak of?\u201d Yoongi asks, brow furrowed.</p>\n<p>Jimin swallows. \u201cHe killed my father. For his rank.\u201d</p>\n<p>The four of them are stunned into silence. Everyone knows the story of Jimin\u2019s father, of course.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHis bracelet,\u201d Namjoon discerns.\u00a0 \u201cHe\u2019s number one? Your father was number one?\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin nods.</p>\n<p>They all exchange a glance full of conflicting emotions. Jimin feels uncomfortable again. It\u2019s hard enough thinking of his father on his own, worse with others involved. He doesn\u2019t want to be seen.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThe rogue we caught?\u201d Hoseok clarifies, having not seen Jungkook with the others. \u201cHe\u2019s the one you\u2019ve been with?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s here,\u201d Yoongi mutters. \u201cAlmost ripped his throat out when I saw him.\u201d</p>\n<p>Hoseok looks like he wants to do just that, grinding his teeth together. He stands abruptly. \u201cYou must be tired, Jimin. I\u2019ll brew you some tea.\u201d</p>\n<p>Namjoon follows to help, and Yoongi drifts off with some excuse. Jimin knows what they\u2019re doing. Only Seungcheol remains; he shifts to sit by Jimin\u2019s side.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThese aren\u2019t your furs,\u201d he murmurs, gaze traveling down Jimin\u2019s bear coat.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI lost them.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDid he make these for you?\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin gives a jerky nod in response. Seungcheol\u2019s tone is neutral, but still Jimin feels a cloying sense of guilt. He has no reason to; he had never accepted Seungcheol\u2019s intention. They were never promised to each other, and everything Jimin has been through with Jungkook was purely out of necessity.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Still, it makes him feel strange. Uncomfortable.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t know what it means,\u201d Jimin mumbles. \u201cI just needed furs.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m glad he kept you safe,\u201d Seungcheol says gently. \u201cWhatever he says, it\u2019s true that we owe him a debt.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI really am sorry about your father. I can\u2019t imagine your pain.\u201d</p>\n<p>Seungcheol stares at his hands, a bitter twist to his mouth. \u201cHe was a good father to me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re Pack Alpha now.\u201d</p>\n<p>The laugh he gives him is humorless. \u201cThere\u2019s no pack to be the Alpha of.\u201d</p>\n<p>It chokes him again - the sadness. Jimin looks away, off at the empty plains, still save for the occasional breeze, and feels it drowning him. There is a part of him that feels like nothing will ever be the same again.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cBut we\u2019re going to try,\u201d Seungcheol says abruptly, steel in his voice. \u201cWe\u2019re going to free our pack.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin glances at him, eyes wide.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ve been planning,\u201d he confirms. \u201cWe won\u2019t let them suffer for much longer. We\u2019ll find a safe place for you, Jimin, and then we will carry it out.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin\u2019s shaking his head before Seungcheol can finish speaking. \u201cI will help,\u201d he insists. \u201cThere are only four of you. You can use one more wolf. You can\u2019t expect me to sit back while our families are in danger when I\u2019m perfectly capable.\u201d</p>\n<p>Seungcheol\u2019s frowning at him. \u201cI don\u2019t like the idea of you in danger.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve <em> been </em> in danger. Our pack is in danger. You need all the help you can get. You know I\u2019m right.\u201d</p>\n<p>Seungcheol can, perhaps, see the fire in Jimin\u2019s eyes. He doesn\u2019t look happy about it, but he says, \u201cWe\u2019ll discuss it with the others, then.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin\u2019s fists are clenched in his lap without his realizing. He relaxes them, staring at the crescent-shaped marks in his palms.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cMy feelings haven\u2019t changed,\u201d Seungcheol says, and Jimin tenses once more. \u201cI know this isn\u2019t the best time, and I don\u2019t expect anything. But I just wanted you to know.\u201d</p>\n<p>A bitter part of Jimin supposes that he should feel lucky. The Pack Alpha wants him despite the fact that he\u2019s possibly been tainted by a rogue. The Pack Alpha wants him to know that it doesn\u2019t matter that he\u2019s just spent the past moon wrapped in another alpha\u2019s furs, that he wants him anyway.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jimin stands, the bitterness spreading. \u201cI\u2019m going to help Hoseok with the tea.\u201d</p>\n<p>Seungcheol doesn\u2019t try to stop him.\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u2744</p>\n<p>Jungkook is there at mealtime.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t have any food. He\u2019s sitting on the same stump Jimin had sat on before, across the fire from where Jimin sits with Hoseok while the others fetch their food. Jimin can feel him staring; he had thought, at first, that it was another alpha\u2019s unwanted attention. But then he had looked up and caught Jungkook\u2019s gaze, dark and intense, his skin glowing in the firelight, and a shiver had run up his spine.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Part of him wonders if Jungkook had come just to see him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jimin looks down at his feet, but he can still feel Jungkook\u2019s gaze like it\u2019s tangible. A flush climbs its way up his neck.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSeungcheol\u2019s going to be disappointed,\u201d Hoseok says, low and amused. Jimin glances at him, surprised, but of course only Hoseok can joke at a time like this.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOver what?\u201d Jimin mutters, scuffing at the ground with his boot.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cFirst time I\u2019ve ever seen you give an alpha the time of day.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not giving him the time of day.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou look seconds from baring your neck.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin flushes harder, smacking Hoseok\u2019s arm. \u201cYou\u2019re not supposed to tease me like that. That\u2019s Taehyung\u2019s job. And anyway, I\u2019m giving you the time of the day, aren\u2019t I? You\u2019re an alpha.\u201d</p>\n<p>Hoseok snorts. \u201cNot the same, sweetheart. And no offense, but that\u2019s disgusting. I think I helped your mother change your diapers.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou were in diapers when I was in diapers!\u201d Jimin splutters.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t wanna know what you\u2019re talking about,\u201d Yoongi grumbles, stopping in front of them. He shoves a very full bowl into Jimin\u2019s hands, one that Jimin recognizes as Yoongi\u2019s own craftsmanship. He must have made it recently.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhere\u2019s mine?\u201d Hoseok demands.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cGet your own.\u201d Yoongi plops down in front of Jimin, effectively blocking Jungkook from view. Jimin doesn\u2019t know if he\u2019s relieved or disappointed. \u201cWhat the fuck is wrong with this place? I had to threaten at least three alphas on the way who wouldn\u2019t stop staring at you, Jimin.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin winces. \u201cYou\u2019re telling me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSorry. Of course you know already.\u201d Yoongi nudges Jimin with his knee until Jimin starts to eat. \u201cNo one's tried to hurt you, have they?\"</p>\n<p>\"Jungkook took care of me,\" Jimin mumbles, staring down at his bowl of food as if that will drown everything else out. He can't wait to leave this place. He's beginning to have nightmares about the alphas, hears their growls permeate his brain when he least expects it.</p>\n<p>\"Do you think he's going to leave?\" Hoseok asks. \"Now that you've found us.\"</p>\n<p>Jimin can't think of any reason why he would stay. \"Yes. I should - I should tell him he can go. Shouldn't I?\"</p>\n<p>Hoseok's gaze is kind. \"Most likely.\"</p>\n<p>\"Eat first,\" Yoongi warns; he can tell Jimin is about to get up right then.</p>\n<p>Jimin forces himself to finish his food. Then he wipes his suddenly clammy hands on his trousers and crosses past the fire to meet Jungkook. Jungkook watches him approach; he only blinks when Jimin stops before him. Now that he's here, he doesn't quite know what to say.</p>\n<p>\"How are you?\" he tries.</p>\n<p>The corner of Jungkook's mouth turns up. Jimin can't tell if the amusement is mocking or genuine. It's hard to tell with him. \"Well. And you?\"</p>\n<p>\"Well,\" Jimin echoes. \"We're - we're going to try to free our pack.\"</p>\n<p>The amusement is now most definitely bitter. Jungkook's gaze travels over to Hoseok and Yoongi, where Seungcheol and Namjoon have now joined them. \"Good luck with that.\"</p>\n<p>Jimin feels a pang of frustration. \"You can leave now, if you want.\"</p>\n<p>His gaze drifts back over to Jimin. It's difficult to read. He nods. \"I'll be leaving tonight.\"</p>\n<p>Jimin isn't prepared for the way his omega reacts. His chest clenches, breath quickening, and he can feel the way his scent turns sour. He tries to swallow down the upset whine that builds in the back of his throat, tries to reason with his wolf, but his omega is instinct only. There's no reason involved.</p>\n<p>\"I wish you safe travels,\" Jimin says softly, then turns on his heel and runs back to his pack before Jungkook can pick up on the change in his scent.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u2744</p>\n<p>Jimin\u2019s omega feels lost, empty, and rejected.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s not your alpha, Jimin tells himself over and over, but it doesn\u2019t make a difference. His omega has gotten used to thinking that he is. Jimin sits at the edge of their little camp and watches the main one in the distance, as if he\u2019ll be able to make out Jungkook\u2019s figure when he leaves. He doesn\u2019t, of course. It\u2019s too hard to tell.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Eventually, he tries to sleep. It eludes him. He wants so badly to rest, but his omega is whining softly inside him, lonely and forgotten. Tossing restlessly, Jimin finally decides the pressure on his bladder is too insistent to ignore and he\u2019s tired of lying there sleepless.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cGoing to take a leak,\u201d he tells Hoseok, who is awake and on watch. Hoseok waves him off.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jimin takes cover further away, under the trees where no one can see him. Not that he thinks any of his packmates would look, but he\u2019s always been a little shy. He relieves himself quickly and when he\u2019s done, he stands and turns around to return back to camp.</p>\n<p>Then the scent of an unfamiliar alpha hits him, and Jimin tenses. The back of his neck prickles, and his mouth goes dry.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cFinally got you alone,\u201d the alpha says, his voice a low rasp, and Jimin turns around slowly, his belly in knots.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not alone,\u201d he says, his eyes frantically moving in search of something to defend himself with. But his brain isn\u2019t working fast enough through the fear, the instinctual cowering of his omega, and he sees nothing. He can\u2019t run, either. The alpha will only be driven to give chase, and Jimin will most definitely be caught then.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He opens his mouth and shouts, \u201cHelp!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTry that again,\u201d the alpha growls, then he\u2019s moving and Jimin\u2019s stumbling back, tripping over a root and falling flat on his ass.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He\u2019s immobilized with terror, the alpha drawing nearer, so afraid that he doesn\u2019t register Jungkook\u2019s scent at all until he\u2019s already there, yanking the alpha back and flinging him to the ground with a growl so threatening Jimin breaks out into a cold sweat.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll fucking kill you,\u201d Jungkook spits, kicking the alpha in the ribs with a sickening crack. It isn\u2019t enough to keep him down, though, and the alpha leaps to his feet and springs back, crouching defensively.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jimin can see the rage in Jungkook\u2019s eyes, can smell it on him, and knows he means his threat. He isn\u2019t lucid. He\u2019s half-shifting in his fury, teeth elongating, his body growing large, fingers stretching into claws. Jimin knows it\u2019s useless to ask him to stop when he\u2019s already so far gone. But if Jungkook spills the alpha\u2019s blood, he\u2019ll be killed for it.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jimin does the only thing he can think of doing. He pushes himself to his feet and launches himself at Jungkook\u2019s chest, burying his nose in his neck, clutching fistfuls of his shirt in his hands.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAlpha, please,\u201d he begs, feeling Jungkook stiffen beneath him, \u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d</p>\n<p>He rubs his nose and cheek against Jungkook\u2019s scent gland, breathing in the thick, cloying cinnamon and clove until his head starts swimming. His scent fills Jimin\u2019s lungs until he feels like he\u2019s drowning, his omega preening with satisfaction, belly tight and knees weak. He holds himself up with a desperate grip in Jungkook\u2019s shirt. He can feel Jungkook begin to go limp, his hard chest softening, the tension in his shoulders leaving slowly. Jungkook\u2019s arms wind around his waist, a low rumble starting in his chest.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Then his grip tightens and his head dips down so he can nose under Jimin\u2019s jaw. The way he holds Jimin is protective, and his scent is so strong, so heady, that Jimin finds himself melting into him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat the hell\u2019s going on?\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin recognizes Hoseok\u2019s voice right away. It brings him back to his senses, and he pulls back. His pack is there; the alpha is slinking away into the woods. Jungkook growls quietly when Jimin moves, tugging him back against his chest, unwilling to let go. Jimin puts a warning hand on Jungkook\u2019s chest, but Jungkook\u2019s glaring at his pack, and his hold doesn\u2019t loosen.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jimin gestures at the space in the trees where the alpha had disappeared. \u201cHe tried to attack me.\u201d He\u2019s surprised to find the way his voice trembles. The adrenaline hasn\u2019t worn off yet, and he hadn\u2019t realized how afraid he was. \u201cJungkook came just in time.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFuck,\u201d Hoseok mutters, looking murderous. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry, Jimin. I wasn\u2019t fast enough.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin tries tentatively to pull away again, but Jungkook hasn\u2019t calmed down enough to let him go.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHey,\u201d Seungcheol bites. \u201cLet him go.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin can feel Jungkook tensing against him again, registering a threat, and hurries to say, \u201cNo, it\u2019s okay.\u201d He turns in Jungkook\u2019s hold to look at him. His eyes are hazy, lips curled in a snarl. \u201cJungkook,\u201d he says gently. He raises a hand and rests it lightly on Jungkook\u2019s neck, just under his scent gland. \u201cI\u2019m fine. Let me go.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jungkook\u2019s reluctant, eyes still glazed over, but his grip loosens enough for Jimin to pull away. With the distance, his expression grows clearer, his alpha relaxing its control on him. But the anger hasn\u2019t quite faded, and he turns on the others right away.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat were you thinking, letting him go alone?\u201d he snaps. \u201cIf I hadn\u2019t been here - \u201d He breaks off, teeth clenching. \u201cI left him thinking he\u2019d be safe with his pack. It hasn\u2019t even been a day.\u201d</p>\n<p>Seungcheol bristles, hands clenching into fists, and their scents are spiking all over again. Jimin\u2019s hands are trembling, too, his legs wobbly and weak. He\u2019s tired. He\u2019s afraid. The adrenaline is wearing off, and he knows that when it does, the terror of what had happened will truly begin to settle in.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cStop,\u201d Yoongi growls, shoving Seungcheol back from where he had begun to posture. \u201cThis isn\u2019t the time to fight like knotheads. Think about how Jimin\u2019s feeling.\u201d</p>\n<p>They both glance at him, the fire fading into guilt.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry,\u201d Hoseok says, again. \u201cIt\u2019s my fault. I let you go alone.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you all right, Jimin?\u201d Namjoon asks gently.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jimin\u2019s eyes drift briefly shut. He shakes his head.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jungkook\u2019s hand encloses around his wrist. \u201cCome on,\u201d he says, nearly a growl. \u201cYou need food. Something warm to drink.\u201d</p>\n<p>Everyone\u2019s tensing again, and Jimin\u2019s tired. He doesn\u2019t want to be around all the tension anymore. He nods. \u201cIt\u2019s all right,\u201d he tells his pack. \u201cI want to go with him.\u201d</p>\n<p>He lets Jungkook lead him away before anyone can protest. He\u2019s shaky, and he grips Jungkook\u2019s arm tight as he walks, afraid his legs might give out on him. He doesn\u2019t take him back to the main camp; he must have given up his tent already, and anyway, Jimin wouldn\u2019t want to go back in the middle of all those alphas once more. Jungkook leads him a ways away, collecting firewood as he walks, until they find a quiet spot. He sits Jimin down on a log and sets to building the fire, working quietly and efficiently.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jimin presses his hands between his legs in a vain effort to stop the trembling. His heartbeat hasn\u2019t slowed down, even now, and his breath still comes quick like he\u2019s being chased. He\u2019s beginning to feel dizzy.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI found this while I was in the woods,\u201d Jungkook says, removing a handful of radishes from his pack. He sits by Jimin and hands him one, watching him intently until he takes his first bite. The radish is flavorful, settles his stomach, and Jimin finishes one quickly. Before he takes his last bite, Jungkook\u2019s there again with another, encouraging him to take it. He does. By the time he\u2019s done, the dizziness has lessened, and Jungkook\u2019s bringing him a cup of something steaming hot.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cElder Kim let me leave with some milk from her goats,\u201d he says, and Jimin\u2019s mouth waters at the sweet scent.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He takes the first welcome sip, and the trembling in his hands begins to slow down. Jimin hadn\u2019t taken his furs into the woods with him when he\u2019d left camp, and Jungkook removes his own now, draping them over Jimin\u2019s shoulders. It isn\u2019t terribly cold tonight, but the warmth is comforting. He fusses over him briefly: tightens the collar of the coat, drapes its hem over his legs.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Jungkook says, and Jimin glances at him, startled. \u201cI thought of my anger before I thought of you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin\u2019s heart clenches. He nods.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t - \u201d Jungkook cuts himself off, looking frustrated. He doesn\u2019t speak much; Jimin wonders if it\u2019s difficult for him to find the way. He seems to find it far easier to act. \u201cI don\u2019t know how to be gentle.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin blinks. There\u2019s a warm flush creeping its way up his neck. \u201cI appreciate everything you\u2019ve done for me,\u201d he says carefully.</p>\n<p>But Jungkook still looks frustrated. \u201cYou deserve to be treated gently.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin\u2019s flushing properly now. His gaze darts away from Jungkook\u2019s, unable to hold it any longer.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you all right?\u201d Jungkook asks. \u201cDid he hurt you?\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin shakes his head. \u201cNo. Just scared me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jungkook nods. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to be scared now. I\u2019m here.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin finishes his milk and wraps his arms around his knees. He can\u2019t quite chase the flush away. \u201cI thought you had left camp already.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI did,\u201d he acknowledges. \u201cAnd when I was leaving I thought I saw him sniffing around your camp. But you had your pack, and I didn\u2019t think - I didn\u2019t think he\u2019d try anything. So I left.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut then you came back,\u201d Jimin whispers, beginning to understand. \u201cFor me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jungkook won\u2019t look at him, glaring at the fire instead, kicking his toe aimlessly into the dirt. \u201cI had to make sure you were safe.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you came back,\u201d Jimin murmurs, twisting his hands together. \u201cAre you going to leave again?\u201d</p>\n<p>Jungkook looks at him, his eyes dark and unreadable. It\u2019s a silly question. Of course he will. What reason would he have to stay? Jungkook remains silent for so long that Jimin is ready to backtrack, to brush himself off. But then he asks, \u201cDo you want me to stay?\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin flushes, swallowing harshly. They aren\u2019t even going to stay here forever. They\u2019ll be leaving soon, setting out on the journey to rescue their pack, something that might end a complete failure. But Jimin doesn\u2019t want him to leave. He wants him to stay.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWill you - will you help us?\u201d Jimin dares to ask. \u201cFree our pack from the Yoo Clan.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jungkook\u2019s eyes are unreadable. \u201cThere is nothing at stake for me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI know,\u201d Jimin whispers. \u201cBut you\u2019re the First Rank. You\u2019re powerful. You said so yourself, my pack won\u2019t stand a chance. But with you, maybe we would. You could help us. We could - we could find a way to repay you, to make it worthwhile.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t think your pack alphas would be very happy with my interference.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThey know we need all the help we can get. They\u2019d be fools not to recognize how strong you are. You could make a world of difference for us.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jungkook\u2019s lips twist, bitter. \u201cThey were my pack,\u201d he admits. \u201cThe Yoo Clan.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin\u2019s eyes widen, breath catching. He had wondered all this time who Jungkook had been before he became a rogue. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p>\n<p>It must be difficult to remember, but when Jungkook recounts it, his voice is hard and cold. \u201cThe Pack Alpha wanted my omega mother for himself. My alpha mother opposed him, so he banished her, along with my sister and me. My mother died at the hands of a pair of rogues who wanted our furs. My sister and I were alone after that, until she died of fever. Then I was on my own.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHow old were you?\u201d Jimin whispers. There\u2019s in a lump in his throat that makes it hard to speak.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI was eight when I was banished.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd - and your omega mother?\u201d</p>\n<p>Jungkook shrugs one shoulder. \u201cStill there, for all I know. The Pack Alpha\u2019s mate.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin blinks through the tears, turning his face away so Jungkook doesn\u2019t see them. Jungkook was just a child, alone in a world full of violence. Somehow he had gone from eight years old and alone to the man Jimin sees now, the number one rogue, someone who has fought and killed countless to maintain his rank.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI am sorry,\u201d Jimin says, voice rough.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jungkook shrugs again. \u201cI remember little of it.\u201d</p>\n<p>But Jimin can tell he doesn\u2019t mean it. He can see the memories in Jungkook\u2019s eyes even now. They\u2019re quiet for a time, watching the fire, and Jimin marvels that this might be the most they have spoken at one time since they met. He doesn\u2019t want to stop. He wants to take advantage of this newfound openness.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDid you know my father before you killed him?\u201d</p>\n<p>Jungkook scoffs quietly. \u201cEveryone knew him. He was First Rank.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou know what I mean.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jungkook peers at him carefully, as if trying to assess how much he should reveal. \u201cHe was terrible.\u201d</p>\n<p>This time it\u2019s Jimin\u2019s turn to scoff. \u201cI already know that. You don\u2019t have to spare my feelings. I\u2019m only curious.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell,\u201d Jungkook considers. \u201cHe was a good fighter, well-known. He killed a lot of people to become number one.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDid you not?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI didn\u2019t intend to take the rank,\u201d he admits. \u201cI killed your father because he was terrorizing some young rogues, barely old enough to no longer be called pups. It was only after he was dead that I realized what I\u2019d done to myself.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u201cIt must be hard,\u201d Jimin murmurs. \u201cHaving a target on your back.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jungkook just shrugs.</p>\n<p>\u201cIs it always like that?\u201d Jimin ventures. \u201cLike that day we were attacked at the cave.\u201d He can still see vividly in his mind\u2019s eye the sight of Jungkook tearing those wolves\u2019 throats out.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAlways,\u201d Jungkook affirms. \u201cThey never give up.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin can\u2019t imagine living a life like that, under constant threat. He wonders if Jungkook could ever give it up - abandon his bracelet and disappear. But they would know, he thinks, that Jungkook is the number one, even without the bracelet. By now everyone must know.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll help you,\u201d Jungkook says, after a moment. Jimin\u2019s head turns sharply toward him, brows rising. \u201cI owe you a debt, after all.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin\u2019s mouth is dry. \u201cYes,\u201d he says. \u201cI suppose you do.\u201d</p>\n<p>The corner of Jungkook\u2019s mouth lifts up. \u201cGood luck telling your pack.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u2744</p>\n<p>Predictably, they aren\u2019t happy.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The concerns are the obvious ones: they don\u2019t know him, they can\u2019t trust him, he has no reason to help them, they have little to repay him with. Jimin counters back with everything he knows they can\u2019t argue against: he\u2019s the First Rank, they need all the help they can get, he\u2019s familiar with the Yoo Clan, he really does have something at stake here even if he says he doesn\u2019t. They need him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>In the end, they would be fools to refuse, and so they don\u2019t.</p>\n<p>The tensions are high as they sit in their little camp, discussing the next step. Jimin sits midway between Jungkook and his pack, hoping to mediate, to keep things from escalating.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThey were using their paddock as a makeshift jail last I saw,\u201d Namjoon\u2019s saying. \u201cIf we can find a way to get around the back undetected, we can free any alphas kept there. Then they can fight alongside us.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe can create a distraction,\u201d Hoseok agrees.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jungkook\u2019s been carving meticulously at a small chunk of wood with his pocketknife since they began the discussion. Jimin thinks it\u2019s a defensive thing, trying to look busy. Now he stops, looking up with a frown. \u201cAren\u2019t you going to invoke the Pack Alpha rites?\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin and the others frown back at him. \u201cThe what?\u201d Yoongi asks.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s how the Yoo Clan works. Challenge the Pack Alpha to a fight and the winner becomes the new Pack Alpha.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yoongi scoffs in disbelief. \u201cNo. They do that?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou were really planning on rescuing your pack by overpowering theirs?\u201d Jungkook scoffs back. \u201cYou won\u2019t stand a chance.\u201d</p>\n<p>They\u2019re all bristling already, and Jimin winces. Not for the first time, he wishes Jungkook had a little more tact.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI thought you only needed us to get you in there.\u201d Jungkook\u2019s words are directed toward Seungcheol now. \u201cThen you\u2019d invoke the Pack Alpha rites. You\u2019re Pack Alpha, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p>\n<p>He almost sounds disdainful. Jimin can see Seungcheol\u2019s hands clench into fists at his sides.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWe didn\u2019t know,\u201d Jimin cuts in before anyone can respond. \u201cOur pack doesn\u2019t work like that. Pack Alpha is lineage only.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s your best bet,\u201d Jungkook says decisively. \u201cSince you wanted my input.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to do it,\u201d Namjoon interjects, ever the sensible one. \u201cWe know very little about the Yoo Clan\u2019s Alpha. We can\u2019t guarantee a win.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd yet,\u201d Yoongi muses, \u201cA one-on-one fight might save us a great deal of bloodshed.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd it might ensure the Yoo Clan\u2019s cooperation, too,\u201d Hoseok adds.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jimin watches Seungcheol\u2019s jaw clench, his eyes fixed on the ground. His heart clenches in sympathy. Ever since they were children, Seungcheol has always strove to do the right thing, to be the best for his pack. Jimin already knows what he\u2019ll choose before he\u2019s spoken. It\u2019s hardly much of a choice at all.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll do it,\u201d he says, and his bitter gaze fixes on Jungkook. \u201cIf it\u2019s the best bet, after all.\u201d</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a moment of silence as the weight of his words settle. None of them are happy with the choice. But they can\u2019t deny that it seems like the most logical one.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThen all we have to do is get there,\u201d Yoongi says, tossing another stick into the fire. \u201cAnd we already know exactly where to go.\u201d</p>\n<p>Namjoon nods. \u201cWe can leave at dawn.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThere is another thing to consider,\u201d Jungkook interjects. \u201cThey\u2019ll be waiting for me when we leave the boundaries of the safe space. Jimin will be a target, too.\u201d</p>\n<p>Hoseok frowns. \u201cShould we separate?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not leaving Jimin with you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd I\u2019m not leaving him with you,\u201d Seungcheol bites back.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cStop it,\u201d Jimin huffs. \u201cDon\u2019t I ever get a say in anything?\u201d</p>\n<p>They both look appropriately shame-faced.</p>\n<p>\u201cI have a better idea,\u201d Namjoon says, and his expression is distant like it gets when he\u2019s busy plotting. His gaze centers, and he nods, affirming it. \u201cYes. I think I know exactly what to do.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u2744</p>\n<p>The rogue encampment has travelling wares here and there, and Hoseok barters for two outfits. Jimin and Jungkook shed their own clothing for the new ones after thoroughly disguising their scents, rubbing an herbal paste over their scent glands. Jimin is loathe to do it, but he rubs his beautiful bear furs against the bark of a pine tree as gently as he can until his and Jungkook\u2019s scents fade from it. Jungkook does the same with his own furs. Jimin\u2019s pack disguises their scents, too, and they prepare to leave.\u00a0</p>\n<p>They don\u2019t disassemble their camp, leaving remnants of it there, as if they\u2019re set to return. They take only what they need and use the cover of night to slip through the camp lands unnoticed. The last part of the plan is up to Yoongi, who has always been small and quick, the perfect choice. He leaves them, exiting the boundaries of the safe land, to find animals to drape Jimin and Jungkook\u2019s thoroughly scented clothes over.\u00a0</p>\n<p>It won\u2019t be easy, slinging a shirt over the antlers of a deer, but Yoongi gets it done. When they hear him jogging through the woods toward them, waving in affirmation, they pick up their things and begin to run in the opposite direction.\u00a0</p>\n<p>It isn\u2019t the most meticulous of distractions, but it\u2019ll have to do. If they can throw any waiting rogues off their trail for even a little while, they can cover some distance unscathed. Though it\u2019s slower, they remain in their human forms, knowing their scents will be less potent that way. The snow has begun to melt, and so they find it easier to hide their tracks as they move.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Only when dawn breaks do they stop to rest, carefully inspecting the clearing they stop in before they dare to settle. Yoongi, Jungkook, and Hoseok leave to hunt; Seungcheol and Namjoon stay back with Jimin to start a fire and gather herbs. They fill their canteens with cold water from the nearby river.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jimin\u2019s sitting with Namjoon while Seungcheol sets water to boil over the fire when the others return. He\u2019s showing Namjoon how to braid catmint into a bracelet, which Namjoon is hopelessly struggling at. Jimin doesn\u2019t realize how big he\u2019s smiling until Hoseok passes by, ruffling his hair, and comments on it.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s the Jimin I know,\u201d he says fondly. \u201cWhat a pretty smile.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin flushes, embarrassed. Jungkook\u2019s staring at him. He looks almost surprised. Jimin supposes he hasn\u2019t had much reason to smile freely since they met. He looks away, feeling shy, and Jungkook joins the others to prepare their dinner.\u00a0</p>\n<p>While they wait for the stew to cook, Namjoon draws a map in a patch of snow of what the Yoo Clan lands might look like now that they\u2019ve taken over the Choi Pack. \u201cThey\u2019ll have extended westward,\u201d Namjoon says, outlining the areas he adds. \u201cBut like we\u2019ve discussed, it\u2019ll be better if we approach them from the east. The terrain is easier there.\u201d</p>\n<p>He sketches their route through the snow, from where they are now to the eastern border of the Yoo Clan. Jungkook\u2019s frowning down at it, eyebrows furrowed, and Jimin peers at him curiously.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d he asks quietly, and Jungkook glances at him. The others are looking at him now, too.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re planning on crossing the river here?\u201d he asks, pointing at a part of Namjoon\u2019s map.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Namjoon nods. \u201cThere\u2019s a bridge there. Do you know it?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s a better way,\u201d Jungkook says. Namjoon hands him the stick, and Jungkook traces another path off to the side. \u201cThis way\u2019s faster.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut it passes through Sun Pack lands,\u201d Yoongi points out.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s the very edge of their lands. They\u2019re a weak pack, small and isolated. They rarely send patrols out that far.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re a big group,\u201d Seungcheol says. \u201cAny pack would deem us a threat.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCrossing the bridge is dangerous and obvious,\u201d Jungkook objects. \u201cWe are bound to run into a threat if we travel that way. It\u2019s slower, too.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t feel comfortable passing through another pack\u2019s lands.\u201d</p>\n<p>They\u2019re beginning to frown at each other, and Jimin can sense a fight coming. \u201cLet\u2019s have a vote,\u201d he interjects. \u201cMajority wins. It\u2019s only fair.\u201d</p>\n<p>They both back down, nodding, although Jimin can tell it\u2019s begrudging. Hoseok calls out a quick vote, and crossing the river wins by a large margin. Only Hoseok votes for Jungkook\u2019s route. Even Jimin doesn\u2019t feel like it\u2019s the best idea to encroach upon another pack\u2019s lands, not when there are six of them and mostly alphas. They can\u2019t afford to invite any extra problems when they already have so many.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jungkook isn\u2019t happy about it, but he accepts it gracefully and doesn\u2019t bring up the route again. They set out early the next morning towards the river crossing. Though their situation is certainly still tense, Jimin feels lighter, more comfortable now that he\u2019s traveling with his pack again. They\u2019re together, and Jungkook\u2019s here, and they\u2019re going to see their pack again.</p>\n<p>But of course, good things never do last.\u00a0</p>\n<p>They aren\u2019t far from the bridge when they begin to pick up on the scents of at least three rogues, maybe four. Jungkook grows immediately tense. He stalks closer to Jimin, jaw set tight. \u201cWe have to move faster,\u201d he tells them. \u201cGet across that bridge. I\u2019ll hold them off.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNot alone,\u201d Jimin insists, but Jungkook doesn\u2019t get the chance to answer - they\u2019re cut off by the telltale snap of a tree branch. They\u2019re close.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cGo,\u201d he hisses, and they all begin to run.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The river moves fast, filled up from the snowmelt off the banks, and the bridge that dangles over it is rickety and weak. They don\u2019t have time to be afraid. Yoongi volunteers to go first to test it and make sure there\u2019s no one waiting on the other side. Jimin watches him cross with his heart in his throat, feeling the fear freeze his limbs just at the sight of his small figure and the rushing water below him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>As soon as he steps onto land, a snarling wolf charges from the woods right for him. Yoongi doesn\u2019t have time to worry about his clothes and shifts immediately, shredding them to pieces, meeting the wolf with a growl they hear even over the river.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cShit,\u201d Seungcheol hisses, bolting across the bridge to join him without a hint of hesitation. Namjoon is quick to follow, stripping his clothes off as he runs.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThere are more coming,\u201d Jungkook warns.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cBetter to get across and join them there than be stuck here,\u201d Hoseok says. He steps onto the bridge and begins to follow.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cGo,\u201d Jungkook insists, and Jimin follows.</p>\n<p>The bridge is as rickety as it looks. It sways as they walk along it, and Jimin clutches the ropes tightly, willing himself not to look down. Hoseok seems to be having a hard time before him. He focuses on putting one foot in front of the other. Ahead of them, Seungcheol, Namjoon, and Yoongi are locked in conflict with two wolves.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jimin looks over his shoulder. Jungkook\u2019s standing on the riverbank, pulling off his clothes; there\u2019s rustling in the trees. He brings his wrist up to his mouth and unloops his bracelet with his teeth. Then he shifts, standing before the bridge like a sentinel.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a wicked growl, and Jimin\u2019s head snaps forward just in time to see a wolf launch itself right onto the bridge. The bridge sways violently, and Jimin clutches the ropes so tightly his hands burn, his feet slipping on the wood. Hoseok shifts to meet the other wolf, the scraps of his clothing falling into the water below.</p>\n<p>The wood creaks beneath Jimin\u2019s feet. If he shifts to join them, the bridge will fall. It\u2019s already in danger of carrying too much weight, and he peers frantically back toward the riverbank. Jungkook\u2019s pinning a wolf down, teeth in its neck, and there\u2019s another one coming from the trees to meet them.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The bridge is rocking fiercely. Jimin has to get off, or Hoseok will go down with the wolf he\u2019s fighting. He turns around and walks back toward Jungkook. Each step feels impossible, and at a particularly violent sway, he nearly loses his footing and slips between the ropes. He holds on with his heart thudding hard in his chest, then dares to take a step and continue on.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He hears something snap, and then he\u2019s falling.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He cries out, grabbing onto the ropes with all his strength as the bridge falls. It\u2019s still staked on his side of the riverbank, and he\u2019s swung into the cliff face, cheek scraping against rock. His grip remains strong, and he braces his feet against the rock. For a moment, he can do nothing but breathe hard through the terror. Then he looks over his shoulder. Hoseok must have jumped just in time; he\u2019s scrambling for footing on the opposite bank. Yoongi\u2019s teeth sink into his scruff and tug him onto land.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The other wolf is gone to the water below them.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jimin takes a deep, shuddering breath and begins to climb. He uses what\u2019s left of the bridge and the cliff face for hand and footholds, climbing up carefully, the adrenaline giving him an extra burst of strength despite his trembling muscles. He\u2019s nearly to the top when one of the rogues leans over the side, teeth snapping inches from his face.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jimin doesn\u2019t allow himself to be startled; he is sure to lose his grip and fall if he does. He keeps his grip firm and doesn\u2019t flinch, staring at the wolf\u2019s row of nasty teeth, the spit that sprays into his face. He hears Jungkook growl, and the wolf\u2019s being dragged back. Jimin continues to climb.\u00a0</p>\n<p>When he tugs himself over the side and collapses onto the riverbank, the two rogues lie dead. Jungkook\u2019s panting, but he noses at Jimin\u2019s head, only pulling away when Jimin confirms that he\u2019s alright. Jungkook shifts back into his human form, tugging his clothes back on quickly.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThere are more coming,\u201d he\u2019s saying. \u201cWe have to go.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin looks across the riverbank. The others are licking their wounds. Finding another place to cross will waste far too much time. He turns to Jungkook, who\u2019s looping his bracelet back around his wrist. He\u2019s injured, blood dripping down his arm.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cCan we still take your way?\u201d Jimin asks, and Jungkook nods. He turns back to the riverbank and cups his hands around his mouth to call, \u201cWe\u2019ll meet you there!\u201d</p>\n<p>They don\u2019t wait to see what the others\u2019 reaction will be. \u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d Jungkook says, urgent, and they head back into the woods.\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u2744</p>\n<p>Jungkook\u2019s injured in more than one place, but the most pressing area of concern is his forearm. The nasty gash that stretches along it is bleeding freely, and Jimin fears that it might invite infection if blood loss isn\u2019t risk enough. His uncle, Sana\u2019s father, is their pack\u2019s main healer, and Jimin and Sana had often helped him in his work. Jimin knows what to do, but that doesn\u2019t stop the way his stomach rolls when he lifts Jungkook\u2019s sleeve to examine the damage.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to,\u201d Jungkook\u2019s saying, perhaps picking up on the distress in his scent. \u201cI can do it myself.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin just shoots him a look. Binding an arm one-handed is far too difficult. He crouches before Jungkook and upends his canteen of water over the gash, cleaning it out, blood turning the water pink as it disperses into the grass around them. Jungkook had filled Jimin's pack with some materials in case of injury during their stay in the rogue encampment, and Jimin finds enough rags to make do. He wipes it clean, murmuring an apology when Jungkook tenses, and binds the wound carefully and tightly, trying to restrict the blood flow.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He settles back, breathing through his mouth, the scent of blood making him nauseous. He looks up, and Jungkook\u2019s looking down, his gaze unreadable. There\u2019s blood on his temple and the corner of his mouth, too. Jimin reaches up and dabs at it carefully with the edge of his sleeve. Jungkook\u2019s gaze stays fixed on his.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThank you,\u201d he finally says.</p>\n<p>\u201cDoes it hurt?\u201d Jimin asks tentatively.</p>\n<p>Jungkook shrugs one shoulder. He reaches out and takes Jimin\u2019s wrists in his hands, his grip gentle, turning his palms face up. \u201cDon\u2019t forget about yourself.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin\u2019s hands are scratched up from the fall. He frowns at them, having barely noticed. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt does.\u201d</p>\n<p>He takes what\u2019s left of the water and pours it slowly over Jimin\u2019s hands, one after the other. They aren\u2019t actively bleeding anymore, and once they\u2019re clean, they only look like a myriad of scratches. Still, Jungkook brings Jimin\u2019s palms up to his lips and blows gently, drying them. Jimin\u2019s face feels hot. He looks away, shy, until Jungkook lets him go.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWill we continue on?\u201d Jimin asks, still flushing too hard to look at him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ll go the way I know,\u201d Jungkook affirms. \u201cI\u2019ll get you there. Think your intended would have my head if I didn\u2019t.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin flushes harder, more anger than shyness this time. He turns his glare back on Jungkook. \u201cHe isn\u2019t my intended. I\u2019ve told you a hundred times.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jungkook\u2019s gaze flickers over his face, searching. \u201cThen what is he?\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin frowns. He winds his arms around his knees, looking down at the grass beneath his feet, stained red with their blood. \u201cHe tried to court me. I rejected his first gift. He still has hopes. That\u2019s all.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jungkook\u2019s brows raise in surprise. \u201cYou refused his courting gift?\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin can\u2019t begrudge him the amazement in his tone. It\u2019s rare enough. Receiving courting gifts from an alpha is a mild enough thing that most omegas accept them even if they have no intentions of accepting the alpha. Omegas, at least in Jimin\u2019s pack, can receive gifts from as many alphas as they want without promising anything to any of them. It doesn\u2019t mean much.</p>\n<p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t interested. I didn\u2019t want to lead him on.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI would have thought it was an honor,\u201d Jungkook says, \u201cto be courted by the Pack Alpha\u2019s son.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t like that for me.\u201d Jimin can\u2019t keep the bitterness from his tone.</p>\n<p>\u201cThen what was it like?\u201d</p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t know why the words spill out, but when he starts, he finds that he can\u2019t stop. No one in the pack had ever bothered to ask him how he felt. His mother had disapproved of the way he pulled away from Seungcheol. Even Sana hadn\u2019t understood. Taehyung had been kinder than the rest, but Jimin doesn\u2019t think he really understood, either.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWe grew up together,\u201d Jimin says. \u201cAnd when he started showing interest, everyone started looking at me differently. We aren\u2019t high up in the pack, my mother and I. We aren\u2019t thought much of.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBecause of your father.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin nods. \u201cI didn\u2019t - I didn\u2019t realize how lowly they thought of us until he started trying to court me. Before, they\u2019d been kind enough. They shared their food with us. The Pack Alpha used to play with me when I was younger. My aunt and uncle let us share their tent. But then suddenly everywhere I went they would say things. About how I\u2019d ensnared poor Seungcheol. How I was trying to climb the ranks. How kind Seungcheol was to even look at me.\u201d</p>\n<p>He digs the toe of his boot into the soil, anger getting the better of him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOne of the elders called me a slut when he thought I wasn\u2019t listening. The Pack Alpha started treating me like a troublemaker, always giving me the meanest tasks. So when Seungcheol tried to give me the earrings, I didn\u2019t take them. I told him I didn\u2019t want them.\u201d</p>\n<p>He looks up at Jungkook, whose gaze is steady but unreadable again. \u201cI wasn\u2019t trying to be ambitious. I didn\u2019t want them to think I was.\u201d</p>\n<p>The words that come out of Jungkook\u2019s mouth shock Jimin into silence. \u201cYou\u2019re allowed to be happy.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin blinks up at him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to squander your happiness because they\u2019re choosing to misunderstand you.\u201d</p>\n<p>His throat feels abruptly tight. His eyes burn. He looks away, swallowing harshly.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Jungkook says. \u201cI will no longer bring him up.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin gives a small, quick nod. He doesn\u2019t trust himself to speak.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cCome,\u201d Jungkook says, standing up and offering Jimin his hand. \u201cWe should keep moving.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin takes the proffered hand and rises.\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u2744</p>\n<p>Travelling with Jungkook is easier than it was the first time - more comfortable. They\u2019re short on supplies, left with Jimin\u2019s bag only, but they make do, moving quickly and carefully through Jungkook\u2019s alternative route. He believes they\u2019ll catch up with the others before long, that they might even make it to Yoo Clan lands before them. The further they get from the rogue encampment, the less tense Jungkook grows. He leaves Jimin alone in the camp to hunt and wash like they used to do before, and Jimin feels no more than a cautionary fear when he\u2019s left alone.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He even dares to walk to the river himself one afternoon; the weather is warmer than it has been, and he\u2019s eager to bathe, his hair matted with grease and dirt. Jungkook had left camp without mentioning where he was headed, so when Jimin begins to pick up on his scent, he\u2019s surprised. He finds him seated on a rock by the river, bare-chested, scrubbing dirt from his shirt. Jimin pauses just by the trees, a flush rising up his neck.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He\u2019s seen Jungkook naked many times before; wolves aren\u2019t shy about their nudity, given how often they shift forms. But something about this feels different. He finds his gaze drawn down Jungkook\u2019s strong chest, to the droplets of water collecting in the divots of his abdomen. The gash on his arm is beginning to heal, and Jimin can tell it\u2019ll soon join the other scars on his body. Embarrassed, he averts his gaze and approaches the riverbank.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He can feel Jungkook looking at him. \u201cI didn\u2019t know you were here,\u201d Jimin admits. Jungkook doesn\u2019t say anything, just goes on washing his shirt.\u00a0</p>\n<p>When Jimin doesn\u2019t move, Jungkook says, \u201cYou can bathe. I\u2019m not stopping you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t look,\u201d Jimin says, cheeks flaming red, his voice almost a whine.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He catches Jungkook\u2019s mouth tilt up in amusement before he turns his back on Jimin. \u201cI\u2019m not looking,\u201d he promises.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jimin strips out of his clothes and sets them on a rock, along with the rag he\u2019ll use to dry himself. He takes the bar of soap along with him, wading into the water and shivering at the chill. He walks deep enough that he can duck his head under the water and come back up with only his head and neck visible.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay,\u201d he says. \u201cYou can look.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jungkook turns back to the water and continues his washing. Jimin feels like a hypocrite for the way he can\u2019t help but look at him, can\u2019t help but admire the corded strength of his muscles and the way his chest tapers off into a trim waist. Jungkook catches him staring, and Jimin looks away quickly, face red all over again.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Jungkook says, amused, and Jimin shakes his head. He rubs the soap between his palms and focuses on lathering it into his hair, trying to pretend Jungkook isn\u2019t sitting just a few feet away.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He ducks under the water to rinse his head off a few times, shaking like a puppy when he rises. The water is cold, but it feels nice on his skin, refreshing. \u201cLook away,\u201d Jimin demands again, and Jungkook obediently pauses to turn around.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jimin rises out of the water enough to wash the rest of his body. Then he wades out of the water, shivering violently, and snatches up the rag he uses to dry himself. He works as quickly as he can, painfully aware of his own nakedness in relation to Jungkook\u2019s proximity. Still a little wet, he tugs on his clothes and tells Jungkook he\u2019s done.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jungkook turns back around, and Jimin crouches by the water to soap off his hands and wash them. He places the bar on a rock to dry with the rag, shaking his wet hands off into the water.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHey,\u201d Jungkook says. \u201cWatch where you\u2019re splashing.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin shoots him a sideways glance. In a sudden burst of mischief, he dips a hand into the water and flings a spray of water in Jungkook\u2019s direction. Jungkook splutters in surprise, setting his wet shirt down and shivering slightly. Jimin finds himself grinning. He catches the exact moment Jungkook decides to retaliate: the surprise fades to resolve, and his shoulders tense. Jimin holds his hands up but Jungkook\u2019s quicker, splashing water in his direction, soaking him from face to chest. Jimin squeaks, reaching toward the water to return an even larger splash his way.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jungkook growls, faking off the rock as if he\u2019s going to pounce, and Jimin shrieks, scrambling back so quickly he falls flat on his ass. He bursts into giggles, tugging his wet shirt away from his chest. Jungkook rises off the rock and Jimin stares up at him as he approaches, eyes wide, wondering if he\u2019s going to try to retaliate again. But Jungkook only crouches before him and takes the rag off the rock. He reaches out and ruffles Jimin\u2019s hair with it, drying his scalp, scratching behind his ears.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to catch a cold,\u201d he warns, and the look in his eyes is impossibly gentle. Jimin flushes, casting his gaze down. Jungkook rubs at his nape through the rag, and the weight of his hands on his neck has Jimin feeling content and satisfied. His omega can\u2019t help the way he responds on instinct, head beginning to tilt to the side, eyes drooping shut happily.\u00a0</p>\n<p>When he realizes he\u2019s about to bare his neck, he forces his head straight with an embarrassed whine. Jungkook\u2019s eyes crinkle. He looks pleased at Jimin\u2019s reaction.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cGo dry off by the fire,\u201d he suggests, and Jimin scrambles off back to camp, too embarrassed to stay any longer anyway.\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u2744</p>\n<p>Jimin\u2019s dreaming.\u00a0</p>\n<p>A part of him is aware that he\u2019s dreaming, that nothing he\u2019s seeing is real. The rest of him is so deeply immersed in the dream that it cannot begin to think of waking into a world where it isn\u2019t reality.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He\u2019s whimpering, in the dream, facedown against the ground, a hand on his nape with a grip harsh enough to bruise. Jungkook\u2019s scent, cloves and cinnamon, is strong and heady around him, has him drooling with desire, eyes rolling back into his head. In the dream, he\u2019s full, body jolting from rhythmic thrusts, his cock rubbing raw and sore against the ground. But he\u2019s barely thinking about his cock. He\u2019s only thinking about the fullness, about how <em> right </em> it feels to have Jungkook inside him. He feels claimed and wanted and satisfied. He can hear Jungkook\u2019s voice by his ear, whispering praise and belonging, feel his fingers rubbing against his scent gland.\u00a0</p>\n<p>When he wakes up, awareness comes to him slowly. It\u2019s still night, the creeping tendrils of dawn just barely peeking through the trees. Jimin feels strange, his belly tight, and he realizes he\u2019s moving. His hips are rocking back against something hard, and he\u2019s wet, so wet he can smell himself, his arousal mixed in with the overwhelming strength of Jungkook\u2019s cloves and cinnamon.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jimin whines, then freezes, eyes widening in shock.\u00a0</p>\n<p>It had grown far colder in the night. They must have been drawn to each other by the fire. Jungkook\u2019s arms are tight around his waist, holding him back against him, his nose pressed against his nape. The hardness against his ass is Jungkook\u2019s hard cock, and he really is wet, leaking slick right onto both of their pants. Jimin shoves a fist in his mouth to hold back the mortified whine building in the back of his throat.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He senses Jungkook begin to wake. A low growl rumbles through Jungkook\u2019s chest, his grip tightening. Then Jimin feels the rough, wet drag of his tongue as he licks right over his scent gland. Jimin whines, sudden and pitchy, leaking another gush of slick.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jungkook pulls away, abruptly, and Jimin nearly cries out at the loss of his warmth, his omega shrinking in dissatisfaction. Jimin turns onto his back and finds Jungkook hovering over him, teeth bared in a snarl, his eyes dark, flickering in the firelight. There\u2019s a damp spot of slick on Jungkook\u2019s pants, right near the crotch. Jungkook reaches down to run his fingers through it, bringing them up to his nose, breathing in deep. Then he rubs his fingers against his own scent gland, growling lowly.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jimin\u2019s hard and overwhelmed, so his reaction is purely instinctual. He spreads his knees apart and drops his head to the side, baring his scent gland, offering himself up for the taking.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jungkook growls, and Jimin shudders, leaking more slick, back arching the slightest bit off the ground. He opens his mouth to breathe a plea but then Jungkook\u2019s pulling away, halfway across the camp, chest heaving. He can see Jungkook squeeze his eyes shut and breathe through his mouth. Jimin\u2019s omega wilts and he curls into himself, sobbing softly, rejected and empty.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jungkook turns around and leaves the camp.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jimin winds himself into a ball, fully crying now, his omega hurting in a way that\u2019s bitter and forlorn. Waking up in the midst of his instincts had meant he\u2019d given his mind up fully to his omega, and so the rejection hurts even more. There\u2019s no rationality involved. Jimin\u2019s omega thinks he\u2019s been rejected by his alpha.\u00a0</p>\n<p>It takes him a while to calm down, to pull back from his instinctual side and regain his own senses. He sits up slowly, scrubbing at the tears, sniffling quietly. The rational part of him begins to return. Jungkook had probably done the best thing by removing himself. They were both half-asleep, barely thinking. Maybe it wouldn\u2019t have been the best to follow through.\u00a0</p>\n<p>And yet, part of Jimin feels satisfied with what could have happened. He wouldn\u2019t have regretted it. He knows he wouldn\u2019t have.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He\u2019d wanted him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jimin changes into his only spare pair of pants, flushing with humiliation when he peels the slick-covered ones away from him and shoves them deep into his pack. Jungkook may very well have gone to the river, and he doesn\u2019t want to risk running into him there. He can wash his pants later.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Then he sits by the fire and waits.\u00a0</p>\n<p>When Jungkook returns, his scent is markedly more subdued. He hovers by the edges of their camp, like he\u2019s afraid to get too close, watching Jimin carefully. Jimin watches him back. Slowly, Jungkook approaches the fire, sitting a fair distance from Jimin.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he says, after a long, tense moment. \u201cI should have pulled away faster.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin blinks, his omega building another whine of dissatisfaction. He holds it at bay with effort. \u201cI didn\u2019t want you to pull away,\u201d he admits.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jungkook nods. He would have sensed it. \u201cYou were unhappy.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin nods back.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Jungkook says, again. \u201cYou don\u2019t - you don\u2019t know what I am. I am not suitable for you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin feels wrong, his chest tight. He frowns, resisting the urge to scoot closer to him, to feel his warmth against his side. \u201cWhy would you say that?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou deserve someone better. Someone softer.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin\u2019s hands clench into fists at his side. \u201cWouldn\u2019t you provide for me?\u201d he demands.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jungkook\u2019s mouth twists, bitter. \u201cI would.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t you protect me?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI would,\u201d Jungkook acknowledges.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd wouldn\u2019t you take care of me?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI would.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd isn\u2019t that all I need?\u201d Jimin insists. \u201cYou are a good alpha. I would be lucky to have you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jungkook looks like his words do nothing but pain him. He stares down at the ground, brow furrowed. \u201cI am not soft or gentle or kind. You deserve someone who would treat you gently. Someone who would bring you warmth and safety. I\u2019m - I\u2019m not that. My hands are rough, Jimin.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin no longer resists the urge. He stands and walks to Jungkook, sitting on the ground right by his side, their thighs pressed together. He takes one of Jungkook\u2019s hands in his and presses his warm palm against his cheek, leaning into it.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThey feel soft to me,\u201d he says, and Jungkook\u2019s eyes fly up to meet his.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He presses his forehead tentatively against Jimin\u2019s, thumb stroking his cheekbone, and lets his eyes drift shut. Jimin brushes their noses together. \u201cYou keep me safe,\u201d he murmurs, and Jungkook\u2019s hand trembles.\u00a0</p>\n<p>They sit there for a long time, breathing each other in.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Later that day, when they\u2019ve made camp for the night again, Jungkook disappears for long enough that Jimin begins to worry. Then he returns holding a necklace made of the bright red seed of a bean bush. He holds it out, the look on his face almost shy, and says formally, \u201cI would like for you to consider me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin blushes, his heart leaping in his chest. He steps forward until their toes touch. \u201cPut it on?\u201d</p>\n<p>Jungkook slips it over his head, fingers brushing his neck lightly as he adjusts it. He steps back to look at Jimin, and his chest puffs with pride.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jimin has trouble sleeping that night. He plays with the necklace, admiring the pretty red of the seeds, and weighs the significance of his very first courting gift in his heart.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u2744</p>\n<p>They continue onward, and everything is fine save for the fact that Jungkook makes Jimin feel unbearably shy. He finds himself blushing more often than not, patting his cheeks to calm down the heat when he\u2019s alone. If Jungkook stares at him for too long, he starts to squirm, fidgety under the intensity of his gaze. Sometimes, when he tries to say something, he just ends up stammering.\u00a0</p>\n<p>It doesn\u2019t help that Jimin\u2019s shyness seems to please Jungkook. He seems almost proud when he can catch Jimin off guard, make him blush by standing just a little too close or staring for a heartbeat too long. On the second day of travel, Jungkook brings Jimin another courting gift: a small whittling of a swan. Jimin tucks it into his pocket and takes it out every now and then to look at it by the light of the fire.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The tentative trust that is blooming between them feels right to Jimin\u2019s omega, like what he\u2019s been wanting all along. But the human part of him worries. Jungkook is packless; he has a target on his back. When they free Jimin\u2019s pack, what will happen next? Jimin can\u2019t imagine Jungkook choosing to stay.\u00a0</p>\n<p>But those are worries for later, and Jimin tries not to let them fester.</p>\n<p>When they grow near to Yoo Clan lands, both of them grow tense. \u201cTheir borders must have changed since I was a child,\u201d Jungkook tells him. \u201cBut from what your pack said, the eastern border should be the same.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you know your way around it?\u201d Jimin asks.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell enough to manage.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe should wait for them there,\u201d Jimin says, \u201cif they aren\u2019t there already.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jungkook nods. \u201cWe\u2019ll keep moving up and down the border until we meet them.\u201d</p>\n<p>They had planned on breaching the Yoo Clan from its eastern border, so Jimin believes his pack will meet them there when they make it. As Jungkook expected, it seems like they have arrived faster, and there is no hint of Jimin\u2019s pack alphas in sight.\u00a0</p>\n<p>They pace along the border, far enough away from it that they\u2019ll be concealed from any patrols, and make camp in a secluded area for the night.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cUnless they ran into trouble, they\u2019ll be here by tomorrow,\u201d Jungkook says, as if he can sense Jimin\u2019s growing anxiety. \u201cI\u2019ll hunt and return. I won\u2019t go far.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin nods, crouching by the fire to tend to it as Jungkook slips into the woods. Jungkook isn\u2019t gone long. Jimin\u2019s still staring into the flickering flames when he hears his return, and he starts, realizing he hadn\u2019t even gotten started on prepping their beds. Jungkook doesn\u2019t seem to mind. He carries a pair of birds to the fire and sets them down, then crouches next to Jimin. He\u2019s holding a small yellow flower in his hand.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIs that for me?\u201d Jimin asks shyly.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cCan I?\u201d He looks to Jimin\u2019s hair, and Jimin nods.</p>\n<p>Jungkook reaches out and carefully weaves the stem of the flower between strands of Jimin\u2019s hair. Jimin flushes at the proximity, staring at Jungkook\u2019s forearm instead of his face, resisting the urge to squirm.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHow does it look?\u201d he dares to ask when Jungkook pulls away.</p>\n<p>\u201cPretty,\u201d Jungkook murmurs, and Jimin really does squirm.\u00a0</p>\n<p>They cook their dinner together and eat in comfortable silence. Jimin sets up their beds, side-by-side; they don\u2019t bother spacing themselves out anymore. \u201cGoodnight,\u201d Jimin whispers, curling up into his furs, and he hears Jungkook\u2019s quiet rumble in response.\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u2744</p>\n<p>Jimin wakes before Jungkook does, a rare thing. He rubs his eyes and tends to the fire, running a hand through his ruffled hair as he gathers his bearings. The flower\u2019s still in his hair; it falls out into his fingers, and he tucks it safely into his pocket. Jimin had seen mint growing not far from their camp while they were pacing the border the day before. It would be nice to have some tea. Jungkook always does so much for him; Jimin would like to do something in return.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He slips away from camp, following his nose, and trods quietly through the woods until he finds what he\u2019s looking for. The mint grows plentiful, and Jimin kneels in the dirt to gather as much as he can hold.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Drowning in the fresh scent of the herb, Jimin doesn\u2019t notice the scent of a stranger until there\u2019s already a hand over his mouth.\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u2744</p>\n<p>They drag him through the woods, his legs scraping against the ground, his coat snagging in fallen branches. Jimin thrashes, but one of them bites the back of his neck until he submits. They drag him right to the main encampment; Jimin immediately notices the way it feels different, wrong. It smells strongly of distress. The sour, rancid scent seeps into everything around him. He wonders how they can stand it.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He\u2019s deposited right in the center of the camp, where he struggles to sit and takes stock of his surroundings. Their tents look far more temporary than the ones in Jimin\u2019s pack, not too different from those of the rogue encampment. The alphas he sees here and there are big, mean, and they all wear necklaces of many-colored beads. He doesn\u2019t see any omegas. Off behind one of the tents, Jimin sees Dokyeom, an alpha from his own pack, chopping firewood. Horror dawns upon Jimin when he sees the way Dokyeom\u2019s leg is twisted at an unnatural angle - broken, healed wrong. He holds all his weight on his good leg. Another alpha stands at his shoulder, watching him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cPack Alpha!\u201d one of the wolves who had taken Jimin shouts. \u201cWe\u2019ve brought you a gift.\u201d</p>\n<p>The flap of the tent directly across the fire lifts. Jimin quakes, scrambling back on his hands, but a harsh grip on the back of his neck stops him. The alpha who emerges stands tall and thick. He wears more beads than any of the others; they drip down to his navel. The furs of a mountain lion cover his shoulders. He\u2019s left the head intact, and it drapes over his arm, glassy eyes seeing nothing. His gaze lands on Jimin, and Jimin trembles so hard his teeth clatter together.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This is the man Seungcheol will have to defeat.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jimin hates the way he begins to lose hope.\u00a0</p>\n<p>They had underestimated the Yoo Clan. Jungkook had been right to doubt them; they didn\u2019t know what they were getting themselves into. They had planned on marching into the camp like it would be easy. Jimin has heard of the Yoo Clan\u2019s strength; of course he has. He grew up with the horror stories told around the fire. But he had never really imagined anything like this.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The Pack Alpha approaches them, booted steps heavy against the dirt. He stops just before Jimin\u2019s quivering form and reaches down to fist a hand in his collar. He lifts him up easily, like he\u2019s a child, and Jimin\u2019s left dangling in the air before him, throat seizing up from pressure.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cA scrawny gift,\u201d he notes, gaze roaming over Jimin\u2019s body. \u201cJust another mouth to feed.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s pretty enough,\u201d tries one of the wolves who had brought him. Jimin focuses on breathing shallowly, his legs kicking in the air on instinct.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThis won\u2019t erase what you did earlier, if that\u2019s what you were hoping,\u201d the Pack Alpha growls. He lets Jimin go. Jimin drops to the ground with a thud, knees hitting the ground painfully hard. He chokes out a quiet sob, clutching his throat. \u201cWe\u2019ll see if anyone wants him, or we\u2019ll leave him out in the woods for the vultures.\u201d</p>\n<p>That\u2019s it. He turns away from him, and the other wolves leave him, too. Jimin can\u2019t move. He feels like his limbs are all locked up beneath him. They hadn\u2019t known it would be like this. How could they have known?</p>\n<p>\u201cCome on,\u201d says a voice, and there\u2019s a strong hand gripping his bicep.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jimin looks up, and the woman looking down at him uses the distraction to drag him to his feet. He feels like he\u2019s lost all his strength, but she\u2019s strong enough for the both of them. She\u2019s older, around his mother\u2019s age, and she wears no beads - only a pair of long, painted earrings. He can tell she\u2019s an omega, though her scent is faded, bitter like the rest of the camp.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cUp, up,\u201d she insists, and he puts his weight on his legs. \u201cI can\u2019t carry you, pup.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin follows her, her hand still tightly gripping his arm, as if she\u2019s afraid he\u2019ll collapse if she lets go. She walks him to one of the larger tents, pulling him inside after her. His eyes take a moment to adjust to the dim light.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cJimin!\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>The shout is followed promptly by the weight of someone\u2019s body slamming into his, knocking him to the ground. Jimin knows that scent, deep, earthy sage. He\u2019d know it anywhere.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cTaehyung!\u201d he sobs, clutching him back with all his strength, like he can make up for missed time with the force of his embrace.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cJimin, Jimin,\u201d his mother\u2019s saying, and Taehyung lets him go only so she can hold him, encasing his face in her gentle hands. She\u2019s crying, and Jimin feels himself begin to cry with her, his gaze flickering over her lined face, barely believing it\u2019s real. \u201cMy son. You\u2019re alive.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin holds the two of them for an impossibly long moment, rubbing his nose against both of their scent glands in turn, the tears overflowing like a waterfall. He\u2019s babbling questions as he scents them, his words tripping over each other as they tumble from his mouth. \u201cAre you okay? Are you hurt? Where\u2019s Sana? Aunt Kyungri? Have they hurt you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSlow down, pup,\u201d his mother\u2019s saying. \u201cSana\u2019s gone - she and Mina ran, they made it out, went for help -\u00a0</p>\n<p>Taehyung has questions of his own. \u201cWhere did you go after you ran? What have you been doing? Why did you come back?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI met the others, Seungcheol and Yoongi and - and the rogue, he helped me, found me - \u201d</p>\n<p>It\u2019s the voice of the omega woman with the painted earrings who interrupts their frantic reunion. \u201cThere will be time for stories later,\u201d she says, her voice gentle but firm. She crouches next to them, and Taehyung and Jimin\u2019s mother back away out of what looks like respect. She gives Jimin a mug of steaming milk, and he takes it gratefully, the warmth finally taking the tremble from his hands. \u201cThey will offer you up to whoever is interested tonight. Have you lain with someone before?\u201d</p>\n<p>He shakes his head, eyes wide, the tremble returning as he begins to register the meaning of her question. She hands him a small bottle of oil.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cTake this and prepare yourself first.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin\u2019s stomach rolls with nausea. He turns his frantic gaze on his mother and Taehyung. \u201cHave they - have you - \u201d</p>\n<p>His mother rests a hand on his knee. \u201cI\u2019m too old,\u201d she says. \u201cThey use me for work.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe alpha who wants me is already mated,\u201d Taehyung tells him. \u201cSo I\u2019ve been able to hold him off. I work, too.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd the others?\u201d</p>\n<p>Taehyung and his mother exchange a glance, and Jimin doesn\u2019t need to hear anymore. He shakes his head, turning to the omega woman, feeling like his insides are shriveling to dust. \u201cI can\u2019t - I don\u2019t - \u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she says quietly. He wonders how many omegas she has had to help this way before. \u201cYou might not be chosen by anyone. But it is better for you to be prepared.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPlease,\u201d he breathes, tears blurring his vision. \u201cPlease, help me.\u201d</p>\n<p>The curve of her mouth is bitter. \u201cI could not even help myself. I can do no more than this, pup.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThis is Iseul,\u201d Taehyung says softly. \u201cThe Pack Omega.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin stares at her. His eyes widen as realization begins to dawn. He should have realized it earlier; all the signs were there. \u201cJungkook\u2019s mother.\u201d</p>\n<p>She reels at his words as if struck. For a long, tense moment, she just stares at him, as if she cannot come up with the questions to even ask. Finally, she blinks herself back to reality and says, \u201cYou know my son?\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin nods, suddenly desperate. \u201cHe\u2019s here. He\u2019s here, he will come - he told me about you - \u201d</p>\n<p>Her eyes are swimming. \u201cHe lives,\u201d she breathes.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHe lives,\u201d Jimin confirms.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd my daughter? My alpha?\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin is loathe to be the one to break the news, but he shakes his head gently. \u201cThere is only Jungkook.\u201d</p>\n<p>The raw sound of pain that comes from her hurts just to hear. She looks away, pressing a hand to her mouth, and squeezes her eyes shut. Then suddenly, she turns back to him, fire in her gaze. \u201cHe cannot come,\u201d she insists. \u201cHe cannot come here. The Alpha will kill him.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin\u2019s smile is wry. \u201cJungkook is not so easy to kill.\u201d</p>\n<p>Someone outside calls her name. She closes her eyes briefly, as if steeling herself, then rises. \u201cI must go. I will return as soon as I can. We must - we must find a way to save my son.\u201d</p>\n<p>She leaves them, and Jimin draws in a shuddering breath. Everything is happening too quickly, and he\u2019s overwhelmed, left unable to process. He can\u2019t do anything but plunge forward and wait for the feelings to catch up to him when he can breathe again.\u00a0</p>\n<p>His mother and Taehyung draw him into a corner of the tent, where their bedrolls are set up side-by-side. He sees now that the tent is too full for its size; there are bedrolls in rows around the perimeter. A few other omegas linger across the tent, watching him warily. Everyone looks underfed. The Yoo Clan must have overestimated themselves when they decided to absorb an entire pack into their own. They clearly don\u2019t have the resources for it.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Aunt Kyungri?\u201d Jimin asks quietly.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cShe\u2019ll be doing the washing by the river,\u201d his mother says. \u201cShe\u2019s all right. We are all doing the best we can.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhen did Sana and Mina run?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNot long after we were brought here,\u201d Taehyung tells him. \u201cThey promised to find help, but it\u2019s been so long. I just hope they\u2019re alive.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou said you saw Seungcheol? Yoongi?\u201d his mother presses, and he nods eagerly.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd Hoseok and Namjoon. They\u2019re alive, they\u2019re well. They have a plan.\u201d</p>\n<p>Taehyung and his mother exchange another glance, and it isn\u2019t a hopeful one. Jimin doesn\u2019t blame them. Mere minutes on Yoo Clan land has shredded so much of Jimin\u2019s hope away. He can\u2019t imagine what months of this have done to them.</p>\n<p>\u201cHow did you survive?\u201d Taehyung asks. \u201cAnd the rogue? You mentioned the rogue?\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin tells them the story, softly and abridged, explaining Jungkook and the rogue encampment and everything Jungkook had done for him. \u201cThis was his pack before he was banished.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd the Pack Omega is his mother,\u201d Taehyung discerns. \u201cDoes that mean - the Alpha - \u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin shakes his head. \u201cThe Pack Alpha banished Jungkook\u2019s alpha mother and took her by force.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin\u2019s mother nods. \u201cI had gleaned something of the sort from our conversations.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s something else,\u201d Jimin dares. He takes his mother\u2019s hand between his own, acutely aware of how fragile it feels to him. \u201cJungkook, he\u2019s First Rank. The rogue he killed to take the ranking was my father.\u201d</p>\n<p>Taehyung swears under his breath. His mother\u2019s eyes widen. Her grip tightens in his, and he strokes the back of her knuckles for comfort. She stares at him for a long moment, unable to find the words. Then her gaze hardens.</p>\n<p>\u201cGood,\u201d she says, and Jimin feels like a chapter of their lives has finally closed. His mother can have peace at last; he knows the threat of his father had loomed over her head even after his banishment. He has only ever remembered her afraid.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you want more milk?\u201d Taehyung presses. \u201cI could make you tea. We don\u2019t have much, but - \u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin shakes his head, reaching out his free hand to take one of Taehyung\u2019s. \u201cPlease don\u2019t worry about me. I\u2019m so happy you\u2019re alive.\u201d</p>\n<p>And he is. The fear of the upcoming trials sits in his bones, but Jimin knows with utmost certainty that Jungkook will come for him. He has no doubt in his heart. Jungkook will come, and if he is right, Seungcheol and the others will be here today, too. They will find a way, together, to end this suffering.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He glances at the other omegas in the tent and scoots closer, lowering his voice. \u201cSeungcheol plans to challenge the Pack Alpha for the title. He thinks if he wins, he can fix this.\u201d</p>\n<p>Taehyung squeezes Jimin\u2019s hand tight and hisses, \u201cHe <em> can\u2019t </em> . He doesn\u2019t know what Ilsung is like. He\u2019ll <em> die </em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin\u2019s throat clogs, and his eyes well with tears. \u201cHe might,\u201d he agrees, blinking them back with a shuddering breath. \u201cBut he\u2019s going to do this for us. And - and if he does, we might have a chance to run.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat are you suggesting?\u201d his mother murmurs.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhatever the outcome of the fight is, we must use the opportunity to leave. They\u2019ll be arriving tonight. We can use the time to prepare, pack a bag, do what we can. In - in all the chaos, we can take who we can and run.\u201d</p>\n<p>They stare at him, the weight of his words settling visibly on their shoulders.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWe cannot let his sacrifice be in vain,\u201d Jimin murmurs. \u201cWhatever the outcome may be.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cEveryone will come to watch the fight.\u201d Jimin can tell by the firmness of Taehyung\u2019s voice that he\u2019s already won him over. \u201cThey keep Dokyeom, Jihoon, and a few of the other alphas and betas locked up in the paddock. They won\u2019t be guarded as carefully during the fight.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin\u2019s already nodding. \u201cWe\u2019ll free them first.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ll warn as many of the other omegas as we can.\u201d</p>\n<p>He looks to his mother, searching for her approval. Her mouth is twisted in worry and doubt. \u201cI already had a bag made,\u201d she finally says, lifting the edge of her bedroll to reveal the strap underneath. \u201cJust in case.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin finds it in him to smile. He squeezes their hands in his. \u201cNo matter what happens,\u201d he promises them, \u201cWe will find a way.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u2744</p>\n<p>The sound of commotion comes quicker than they expect. He hears shouts, growls, the snapping of teeth. The thud of skin against skin. Jimin can smell him: heady clove and cinnamon laced with rancid distress, with despair. On feet that move of their own accord, Jimin leaves the omega tent, feeling like he\u2019s waiting to tip over the edge of a precipice.\u00a0</p>\n<p>There are three alphas holding Jungkook down, and still he fights, claws out, teeth bared. His eyes are dark, and the closer Jimin gets, the more bitterness he picks up on in Jungkook\u2019s scent.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cJungkook,\u201d he says, and Jungkook\u2019s struggling ceases, his head snapping over to look at him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cJimin,\u201d he growls, and Jimin takes another step forward only to be stopped by a sharp tug to the back of his hood.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He stumbles back, looks behind him and trembles to see the Pack Alpha, his hand firmly holding Jimin in place. Jimin\u2019s knees wobble, and the look he turns back on Jungkook is full of fear.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat is this?\u201d the Pack Alpha asks, his voice a low rumble, and Jimin swallows harshly.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cLet him go,\u201d Jungkook growls, and the Pack Alpha\u2019s grip tightens.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHe belongs to us now, pup. You have no claim.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t belong to anybody,\u201d Jungkook spits. \u201cLet him go.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cChain him up in the paddock,\u201d the Pack Alpha orders. \u201cIf he continues to struggle, we might have to put him down.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin\u2019s eyes widen. \u201cNo - \u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAlpha of the Yoo Clan,\u201d Jungkook says, his voice hard and formal, and Jimin\u2019s heart slows with dread. \u201cI challenge you for your rank.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin\u2019s heart stops. \u201cJungkook, no!\u201d he cries, but Jungkook\u2019s gaze is locked firmly on the Pack Alpha\u2019s.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The Pack Alpha lets out a barking laugh. \u201cWhat\u2019s this? A challenge?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you accept?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know what you\u2019re doing, pup. Don\u2019t be a fool.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you accept?\u201d Jungkook shouts, the veins in his neck throbbing with fury.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The Pack Alpha\u2019s voice hardens. \u201cI accept.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u2744</p>\n<p>As Taehyung anticipated, everyone comes to watch the fight.</p>\n<p>Jimin has gone through his whole life feeling like he stands on the edge of a precipice looking down into nothing. Behind him are the echoes of distant fears: his father, the harsh winters, the Yoo Clan, Seungcheol, loneliness. The past months have brought a host of new fears to pile on behind him. Each one pushes, and he wobbles, staring at the vast nothingness below him. He wobbles, but then he stands steady again.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t know if he can hold his balance through this.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He stands beside his mother, feeling fear in a way he has never quite felt it before. He watches Jungkook stand tall on one side of the clearing, removing his furs and tossing them aside. Across him, Ilsung does the same. He removes his beaded necklaces, one-by-one, and hands them to Iseul, who stands behind him with a blank face.</p>\n<p>To be reunited with her son only to lose him again - Jimin can't fathom her pain.</p>\n<p>Ilsung and Jungkook are taking off their shirts and shoes, putting them aside for someone to carry away, leaving them in just their trousers - bare and vulnerable. Two betas carry wooden drums decorated with ropes to either side of the circle; the others make room for them. They begin a rhythm that thrums in Jimin\u2019s chest, like a second heartbeat.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThe Yoo Clan bears witness!\u201d Ilsung shouts, turning and raising his arms before the crowd. \u201cI have been challenged for my rank.\u201d</p>\n<p>Someone howls.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWatch me put this pup in his place.\u201d</p>\n<p>More howling, like a chorus, as Ilsung beats his fists against his bare chest. Jimin trembles, and his mother takes his hand in hers, squeezing tight. Jungkook is unfazed, stalking the other end of the circle with his jaw set tight and his gaze calculating. Jimin has faith in him; he does. He\u2019s seen Jungkook fight. No matter how powerful Ilsung may be, how frightening, Jungkook is still the number one. The bracelet of teeth clacking together on his wrist reminds him of that. Jimin remembers how frightening Jungkook had been to him the first time they met, and considers that Ilsung only seems more frightening now because Jungkook doesn\u2019t scare him anymore.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jungkook\u2019s going to win. Jimin has to believe it.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThis won\u2019t be long,\u201d a beta standing not far from Jimin says, amusement in her voice. Jimin bristles, nearly snapping his teeth at her before his mother squeezes his hand in warning.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jungkook turns his head, peering at the crowd until his gaze meets Jimin\u2019s. He nods once, and Jimin presses a hand to his heart in response. Then Jungkook turns back to Ilsung, and Jimin can see the shift in his demeanor - everything grows tense, hard, and ready.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cBegin,\u201d one of the elders calls.</p>\n<p>Nothing happens at first. Ilsung and Jungkook circle each other, and every now and then Ilsung throws out a vicious snarl. Jungkook isn\u2019t intimidated. Jimin swallows harshly, his stomach sick with anticipation. In the end, it\u2019s Jungkook who strikes first. When he lunges, Jimin\u2019s heart lurches and he nearly vomits right there, his entire body jolting in surprise. Ilsung dodges easily, ducking back and away, and Jungkook resumes circling him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>It doesn\u2019t seem to faze him that his lunge is so easily dodged. Jimin wonders if he\u2019s just trying to get a sense for how Ilsung moves. His theory seems to hold; Jungkook strikes a few more times, and Ilsung avoids him each time. By the third time, Ilsung is laughing.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you going to best me like this, pup?\u201d</p>\n<p>Jungkook doesn\u2019t bother with an answer. The arrogant tilt of his head is enough.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jimin holds his breath. The next time Jungkook strikes, he doesn't stop. He advances upon Ilsung with a flurry of blows, limbs moving in sharp, controlled ways. Jimin's coiled taught like a string, pressing against his mother's side for comfort, feeling like his muscles tense further with every step Jungkook takes. He moves quickly and aggressively, has Ilsung hard-pressed to block and dodge each blow. The control he has over his movements is stunning, honed by years and years of experience.</p>\n<p>But Ilsung is powerful, too, and his brute strength will be an obstacle all on its own. Jungkook keeps up the pressure, forcing him toward the edge of the circle, until Ilsung\u2019s leg darts out and wraps around Jungkook\u2019s. Jimin inhales a sharp breath when Jungkook goes down, squeezing his mother\u2019s hand so hard it must hurt. But Jungkook is quick to roll as he lands, vaulting himself back onto his feet before Ilsung can pin him. Jimin lets out a shuddering exhale.\u00a0</p>\n<p>They\u2019re crouched, watching each other, and Jimin\u2019s insides are squeezed tight with anticipation.</p>\n<p>\u201cCome on, pup,\u201d Ilsung goads. \u201cYou won\u2019t keep your omega like this.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jungkook\u2019s face doesn\u2019t even flicker. He remains calculating, but this time it\u2019s Ilsung who strikes first, tired of waiting - he launches himself at Jungkook\u2019s midriff, clearly intent on throwing him, but Jungkook plants his feet on the ground and pushes back. For a moment, they are both still. If it weren\u2019t for the way their veins pop and their skin turns red from exertion, it wouldn\u2019t look like they were expending any effort at all, just holding each other.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Then Ilsung shifts the momentum, his leg locking around Jungkook\u2019s once more. This time, he succeeds in bringing him down.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jimin doesn\u2019t realize he\u2019s let out a pained whimper until his mother shushes him, stroking his arm in comfort. They\u2019re on the ground now and all Jimin can think about is how big Ilsung is, how strong, and how if Jungkook dies, he doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019ll do with himself.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m going,\u201d Taehyung whispers, hardly a breath in his ear, and Jimin startles. He remembers they had a plan, that during the fight they were meant to set their escape in motion. Faced with Jungkook, though, Jimin had forgotten everything.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI have to stay,\u201d Jimin whispers, and Taehyung nods. He presses his forehead briefly against Jimin\u2019s, and then he slips away from the crowd, quiet as a mouse.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Ilsung\u2019s fist meets Jungkook\u2019s face before Jungkook rolls away, spitting out a glob of blood into the dirt. Jimin\u2019s chest aches, and he finds he can\u2019t breathe. Ilsung\u2019s on him again and Jungkook knees him in the stomach, but Ilsung lands a succession of nasty blows on his sides, keeping him in place. Jungkook writhes, somehow twisting his way out from underneath Ilsung, but Ilsung follows, pinning him onto his stomach, hand on the back of his neck.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Jimin whispers, and his eyes are burning and his skin is burning, too. Jungkook can\u2019t die. He can\u2019t.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Ilsung presses his knee into the small of Jungkook\u2019s back, grinding his face into the dirt. Beneath him, Jungkook\u2019s twisting, trying to find a way out. He spits out more blood. Jimin\u2019s legs feel weak; he doesn\u2019t know how much longer he can hold himself up. Some of the crowd is cheering on their Pack Alpha, calling for him to finish it, but some of them are silent. Jimin can\u2019t tear his gaze away from Jungkook and Ilsung long enough to check, but he knows their faces won\u2019t show the joy of the others. Many of them will hate Ilsung - he knows that intrinsically. Jimin isn\u2019t the only one who wants Jungkook to win.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jungkook gets an arm free and rams his elbow back into Ilsung\u2019s face. It shatters his nose, blood dripping down into his mouth, and he hisses, letting go of Jungkook on instinct. Jungkook shoves back and turns the tables, pinning Ilsung down instead, and Jimin\u2019s eyes fill with tears of relief. But Ilsung manages to wrap his legs around Jungkook\u2019s waist, bucking him off - Jungkook stays strong long enough to land a rain of blows on Ilsung\u2019s already bloody face before he\u2019s shoved away. Ilsung rolls onto his feet faster than Jungkook can and kicks his side so hard Jimin can hear the bone crack - Jimin shudders, horror turning his veins to ice.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jungkook scrambles onto his feet before Ilsung can land another blow, clutching his side, blood dripping from the corners of his mouth. His face is growing pale, sweat matting his hair to his forehead, and Jimin can see the way his body has begun to tremble.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cCome on,\u201d Jimin breathes. \u201cJungkook, come on.\u201d</p>\n<p>He expects Jungkook to stay back, to recuperate, but he launches himself at Ilsung with twice the fury as before, putting pressure on Ilsung like he had at the very start of the fight. He isn\u2019t the only one who\u2019s tired - Ilsung\u2019s movements are slower than before. Jungkook is smart, pressing him while he still can, looking for a way to land a blow that will hurt.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The grass is uprooted by the speed of their fight, leaving sprays of dirt, and Jimin can see blood mixing into the ground. The beat of the drum is far slower than the frantic pace of his heart, but he can still feel it thrumming through his veins.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cFinish him!\u201d someone shouts, and Jimin doesn\u2019t need to wonder who they mean.\u00a0</p>\n<p>His mother\u2019s voice comes urgent by his ear. \u201cThey\u2019re here.\u201d</p>\n<p>No one is looking at him, but Jimin refrains from turning suddenly anyway, afraid of drawing attention. At the edge of camp, he sees Yoongi dragging an unconscious alpha into the woods - one of the few guards they had left to watch the perimeter during the fight. Through the trees, he catches a glimpse of Namjoon, and with him, Sana and Mina. His eyes widen. They\u2019re here.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jimin turns back to the fight just in time to watch Ilsung lift Jungkook bodily into the air and slam him onto the ground. His heart stops, and he can\u2019t help it this time - he cries out, taking a step forward. Ilsung follows Jungkook to the ground, hitting him wherever he can reach, and the assault is too fast and too hard for Jungkook to have the chance to gather himself. He holds his arms up to protect his face and Ilsung goes for his chest, his ribs instead, hitting him where he\u2019s already hurt.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jungkook\u2019s arms go limp, falling to his sides, and Jimin sees his eyes flutter - he\u2019s fighting to keep them open.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jimin\u2019s pack is here. Even if Jungkook loses, there is hope - they will find a way out of this. But Jimin understands acutely that he doesn\u2019t want to escape without Jungkook by his side. He won\u2019t leave this place without him. Jungkook can\u2019t die. Jimin won\u2019t let him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>But there\u2019s blood pooling on the ground around him and Jungkook\u2019s body is going lax.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cJungkook!\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jimin tears his arm from his mother\u2019s grasp and falls to his knees just inside the circle, five feet from where Jungkook lies bleeding in the dirt, Ilsung\u2019s fists meeting his head. Around them, some of the pack have begun to stomp on the ground, chanting Ilsung\u2019s name. They think the end is near. He hears his mother call for him, but it sounds muffled, distant. Everything does. There is only this: Jungkook, Ilsung, and Jimin, doomed to watch.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cJungkook, get up!\u201d Jimin shouts, his voice clear and firm. He doesn\u2019t know if Jungkook can hear him anymore, but he tries, anyway. \u201cYou are Jungkook of the First Rank, a king among the packless! They are nothing compared to you!\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jungkook\u2019s hand twitches.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cGet up!\u201d Jimin cries. \u201cShow them who you are! Show them what number one means!\u201d</p>\n<p>Ilsung is laughing at him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cGet up, Jungkook!\u201d</p>\n<p>Jungkook twitches, and then his hand is flying up to seize Ilsung\u2019s throat, squeezing tight. Ilsung\u2019s hands fly to tear Jungkook\u2019s off and Jungkook surges upward, finally free from his relentless punches. Ilsung\u2019s nails tear at the skin of Jungkook\u2019s arm but he doesn\u2019t let go, and Ilsung\u2019s face begins to turn purple. Jungkook drags him down, arm locking tight around his neck, and slams the fist of his free hand into Ilsung\u2019s face.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThis is for my family!\u201d he shouts, and then he grabs Ilsung\u2019s hair and twists his arm.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The snap of bone echoes across the clearing.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The drums stop, and the crowd grows silent. Jungkook lets Ilsung\u2019s limp body fall to the ground and he stands, his entire body trembling. But he stands tall nonetheless, baring his bloodied teeth at the pack.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIlsung,\u201d he spits, \u201cis dead.\u201d</p>\n<p>Someone steps forward from the crowd - an old man with white hair and beads down to his navel. \u201cOur new Pack Alpha,\u201d he says, voice carrying despite his age.\u00a0</p>\n<p>There is a beat of silence, and then -\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAlpha! Alpha! Alpha!\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>The pack\u2019s voices rise as one.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Two more elders come forward to drag Ilsung\u2019s body away. It\u2019s only then that Jungkook\u2019s body gives up on him. He falls, hitting the ground with a painful-sounding thud. Jimin scrambles to his feet and runs, falling beside him, cradling his head in his lap.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cJungkook,\u201d he mumbles through his tears, but Jungkook is already unconscious. He\u2019s alive, and Ilsung is dead. \u201cYou did it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHealers!\u201d someone calls, and Jimin sees Sana\u2019s father and another beta break away from the crowd to come toward him. Jimin\u2019s arms tighten instinctively around Jungkook.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Iseul is at his side, hand on his shoulder. \u201cLet him go,\u201d she says gently. \u201cThey will help him mend, and he must rest. All you can do for him now is let him go. When he wakes, you can join his side.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin understands, but he doesn\u2019t want to let Jungkook go. Not after all that. It takes him a moment to gather himself, gently placing Jungkook\u2019s head on the ground and moving back. The healers administer what they can there, before they have members of the pack begin to lift him and carefully carry him toward another tent. Jimin watches them go. His hands are shaking, Jungkook\u2019s blood wet on his fingers. Iseul remains by his side, and when he hears her sigh, he looks over.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Her expression is one of yearning. It is indescribable, and Jimin\u2019s heart clenches.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cMy son,\u201d she whispers, her gaze locked on the tent where Jungkook lies. \u201cMy son.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u2744</p>\n<p>Jimin hovers outside the infirmary tent. He doesn\u2019t know why he feels so afraid. Everything\u2019s alright now; he should feel relieved. But fear doesn\u2019t quite work like that. During the fight, Jimin had been too afraid to feel anything but adrenaline. It\u2019s catching up to him now that the threat has passed.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He works up the courage to reach for the tent flap, but it rises before he can touch it. Seungcheol steps out, not looking as surprised to see Jimin as Jimin feels to see him. He inclines his head in greeting, and Jimin dips his in return. After Jungkook was taken away, Seungcheol and the others had succeeded in freeing the prisoners from their pack. It had resulted in more fighting, the Yoo pack not willing to back down just because their alpha was dead, until the elders had stepped in. They had called for an end to the fighting until their new pack alpha woke and made his decision.</p>\n<p>Since then, all has been quiet as Jungkook heals.</p>\n<p>\u201cI was visiting Jungkook,\u201d Seungcheol explains, and Jimin blinks at him, still surprised. \u201cAre you going to do the same?\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin nods.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIt looks bad,\u201d Seungcheol says gently. \u201cBut he\u2019ll be alright.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin nods again. \u201cI\u2019m glad you made it here safely.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you did, too.\u201d He looks like he wants to say something more, so Jimin waits. He shuffles his feet, then says, \u201cYour heart is set on him?\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin swallows. He only hesitates out of concern for Seungcheol\u2019s reaction, but otherwise he knows exactly what his answer is. \u201cIt is.\u201d</p>\n<p>Seungcheol nods. \u201cI\u2019ll step back, then. I wish you happiness.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin blinks, even more surprised than before. Alphas don\u2019t tend to back down just because an omega shows interest in another alpha. They see their courting to the end; it\u2019s fair game until the omega has a mating mark.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Jimin says. \u201cI - you\u2019ve always been kind to me, even when others weren\u2019t. It meant a lot.\u201d</p>\n<p>Seungcheol smiles. It\u2019s laced with sadness, but even at the end, Seungcheol remains kind. \u201cAnd thank you for always turning me down so kindly.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI wish you happiness, too. I hope you will find someone worthy of your love.\u201d</p>\n<p>Seungcheol looks doubtful, but he nods. He steps back, opens his mouth as if to say something more, then stops himself. He turns away, leaving Jimin standing alone in front of the infirmary.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Taking a deep breath, Jimin lifts the flap of the tent and slips inside. The Yoo Clan healer nods to him. She\u2019s tending to a child with a nasty cough, but other than them, the tent is empty. Save for Jungkook. Jimin swallows harshly, moving through the tent, glancing at each bedroll as he passes. They\u2019re separated by curtains held up by stakes. When he nears the last bedroll, he picks up on Jungkook\u2019s scent and pauses, hovering behind the curtain.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He hesitates for too long. \u201cJimin,\u201d Jungkook rasps, and Jimin peeks his head around the curtain.\u00a0</p>\n<p>To put it mildly, Jungkook looks terrible.</p>\n<p>His torso is bandaged all the way up to his chest. The bandages wrap around his left shoulder and cover his entire arm. His face is swollen and bruised, one eye completely shut, and his mouth is scabbed and swollen. One of his legs is in a splint. The healer must have dressed him recently, but already some of the bandages are blooming red. When he breathes, the sound is wet.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jimin presses a trembling hand to his mouth to stop the sob that threatens to come out. He steps past the curtain and sinks to his knees beside Jungkook\u2019s bedroll, gaze flickering frantically over his battered body. He hates crying in front of people, but when the tears spring to his eyes, he doesn\u2019t even have it in him to feel embarrassed.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy did you do that?\u201d Jimin wails, the tears spilling freely from his eyes now. His hands hover over Jungkook\u2019s body, afraid to touch him but needing to comfort all the same. \u201cWhy would you do something so stupid?\u201d</p>\n<p>Jungkook stares at him through his one good eye, though good is a relative term - it\u2019s half-lidded from the swelling, too. \u201c\u2018S alright,\u201d he rasps. \u201cLooks worse than it is.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLiar,\u201d Jimin sobs. \u201cWho told you to fight him? Why would you do that?\u201d</p>\n<p>The corner of Jungkook\u2019s mouth twitches, and even all battered he manages to look amused in that way of his. \u201cI guess I had something at stake, after all.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin wipes his tears away with a fist, sniffing. \u201cDid you see her yet? Your mother?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShe came to see me. We didn\u2019t talk much, but it was - \u201d His eye drifts shut, and he sighs. The sound of it is painful, and Jimin winces. \u201cIt was nice.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m glad.\u201d Jimin settles on taking his hand between his own gently, though his fingers are bandaged, too. He thinks they must be broken.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2018S alright,\u201d Jungkook says, again. \u201cNot gonna break if you touch me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s because everything\u2019s broken already,\u201d Jimin huffs, fighting the urge to burst into tears again.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jungkook grins as best as he can with his face all swollen. He pats the bedroll by his side. \u201cCome lie with me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin peers at him dubiously, not wanting to injure him further, but he closes his eye and waits, lifting his good arm up. Tentatively, Jimin lies down next to him, only allowing the barest brush of their bodies. But Jungkook puts his arm around him and pulls him closer. Jimin lightly rests his head on Jungkook\u2019s uninjured shoulder.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy would you do that?\u201d Jimin whispers, lump in his throat again. \u201cI thought - I thought I was going to lose you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI thought so, too,\u201d Jungkook admits. \u201cThen I heard your voice.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou heard that?\u201d He hadn\u2019t been sure his voice would reach through to Jungkook, not when there was so much noise, not when Jungkook was so far gone.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou pulled me out.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin rests a light hand on Jungkook\u2019s bandaged stomach, brushing against it softly. \u201cYou\u2019re Pack Alpha now.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jungkook winces. \u201cDon\u2019t remind me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShould have thought about that before you did something so stupid.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI would do the same thing again in a heartbeat,\u201d he says seriously.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jimin doesn\u2019t have the words to answer that, so he doesn\u2019t. He breathes in Jungkook\u2019s scent and reminds himself, over and over, that Jungkook is alive. That they made it.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m thinking about finding a way to abdicate,\u201d Jungkook murmurs. \u201cI spoke to Seungcheol about it just before you came.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI saw him walking out.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe came to thank me. And to tell me that he would pose no challenge to my leadership.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut you don\u2019t want this.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not made for it,\u201d he agrees. \u201cI don\u2019t even know what it\u2019s like to live among others.\u201d His hand comes up to play with a strand of Jimin\u2019s hair, twirling it between his fingers. \u201cHe would be much better at it than me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI think you would be a good leader if you tried,\u201d Jimin says honestly, and Jungkook smiles.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t know about that.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin puts a hand in his pocket in search of the whittling Jungkook had given him; he holds it often for comfort, and he wants to show Jungkook that he still has it. Instead, his fingers brush something else, and he laughs quietly in surprise.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Jungkook asks.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jimin pulls out the flower Jungkook had placed it in his hair the night before he was taken. It\u2019s dried now. He holds it up for Jungkook to see. \u201cI still have it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jungkook smiles, too. \u201cAll this time I\u2019ve been lying here. Been thinking about what your next courting gifts should be.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin huffs. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be thinking about that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThink I\u2019ll make you a blanket. Want you to be warm.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cJungkook,\u201d Jimin says, almost a whine.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cMight scent it, too.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cJungkook!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd some new furs. Yours have seen a little too much. Maybe a tiger\u2019s.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIf you go anywhere near a tiger, I will kill you myself.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat so?\u201d Jungkook cracks an eye, and it twinkles with laughter.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re terrible,\u201d Jimin mumbles, and Jungkook\u2019s fingers stroke lazily through his hair. He\u2019s beginning to feel choked up again, overwhelmed. \u201cThank you. For everything. You\u2019ve done so much for me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t need to thank me. Only done what I should have.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019ve done much more than that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Jungkook objects. \u201cOnly what I should. Protect you, provide for you, take care of you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI told you,\u201d Jimin whispers. \u201cI told you I\u2019d be lucky to have an alpha like you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m lucky, too. Lucky you even looked at me.\u201d He takes in a breath that sounds painful, and Jimin frowns, wondering if he should be speaking so much at all. \u201cWhen I first saw you, I - you\u2019re so pretty. Alluring. And your scent - \u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin\u2019s blushing too hard. He presses a hand against his cheek to calm down the heat, but it\u2019s useless.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cVanilla, amber, so - so inviting. Felt like I was under a spell. Couldn\u2019t get it out of my nose.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin remembers his own reaction to Jungkook\u2019s scent, the way it had made him dizzy, how it had overwhelmed him with its strength. \u201cI think your scent put me in an early heat,\u201d he blurts, then whines in embarrassment. \u201cI wasn\u2019t going to tell you that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat wasn\u2019t your time?\u201d He sounds surprised.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo. I was early.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd you think - \u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin nods against his shoulder, too shy to speak. Jungkook\u2019s quiet, his fingers still moving in Jimin\u2019s hair.</p>\n<p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d he says quietly, \u201cthis was meant to be.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d Jimin breathes, and this time he doesn\u2019t hold back the tears that threaten to slip from his eyes. \u201cAre you - are you going to stay?\u201d</p>\n<p>Jungkook\u2019s quiet. Then -\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you want me to stay?\u201d</p>\n<p>It\u2019s an echo of a question he had asked before, back when Jimin had only been able to provide an excuse as an answer, a reason to keep him around. He doesn\u2019t need an excuse anymore.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d he says, and Jungkook hums softly.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll stay.\u201d<br>\n<br>\n</p>"
