  "text": "<p>\"</p>\n<p>They shoot RK-8978 for the crime of leaving.</p>\n<p>They mean her as an example. Here, they say, here is what happens to those who would defect, defy, rebel. Here is the cooked blood and collapsed charred flesh of your sister, of the thing who was once your sister, of the anomaly, the broken.</p>\n<p>Here, they say, lies sedition. See how broken it is. How bloodied. See the obscene redness of treachery\u2019s blood against the moon-paleness of her skin. See how small she is, without her armour, see how weak, how she breaks before blaster fire.</p>\n<p>Here she lies, the example, she-who-would-have-left. Here is what happens to the Troopers who would follow in the footsteps stamped by FN-2187, here is the example.</p>\n<p>The problem the First Order never considered: the example is subjective. A body, cooked and smouldering by a blaster hail, a girl of intermediate age, hair blackened and wisping -- cut down by her very squadmates -- is meant to say all of the above and more, is meant to stand as a fixed point.</p>\n<p>But TQ-7676 watches with his tongue thick in his mouth, his hands sweating within his gauntlets, bright white in a sea of bright white, and he thinks: this is what they do to those who are caught.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cTQ-7676\u2019s squad was poisoned,\u201d General Hux says, his voice low and dangerous, resounding through the galaxy, on holoboards and in dorms, in mess halls and officer lounges. Everyone watches, and everyone hears. \u201cInfected with treachery -- his crime was the crime of his whole squad, who failed to report their concerns to superiors, and so they will all face the consequences.\u201d</p>\n<p>Blasters sing. Twenty three Troopers fall into smoking ruin.</p>\n<p>The message intended: watch each other, report each other, your crimes are the crimes of your unit; you are not individuals.</p>\n<p>The message intended: rebellion is a sickness, a tumour, a cancer to be carved from the flank of the Order.</p>\n<p>The lesson RT-5687 (otherwise known as Red, for the colour of her hair) \u00a0learns: when you leave, take with you all you love.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>This time, they do not broadcast the execution.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt offers the wrong message,\u201d Hux says, heels wearing a path in the corridors of the Finalizer. \u201cIt shows that people are leaving. It proves Ren right -- he\u2019s already muttering his venom to the Supreme Leader.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo we pretend it never happened,\u201d says Phasma.</p>\n<p>Hux sighs. \u201cDon\u2019t be so <em> literal </em> Phasma. It\u2019s unbecoming. It\u2019s about...shaping the truth. Telling them how to think. Telling them what the story <em> really </em> is -- get them by their thoughts, and the rest will follow. They <em> cannot </em> think that FN-2187 is someone they can imitate\u2026\u201d he blinks, a slow smile curving his face. \u201cSo we tell them that he is not one of <em> them </em> . I always thought he was a little too good to be a <em> genuine </em> Stormtrooper.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The mark of good propaganda: when it convinces even those who dream it up.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Before she died, RT-5687 said to EG-5555 <em> did you hear of the traitor FN-2187 </em> and EG-5555 said <em> yes he was a Resistance plant, didn\u2019t you hear? </em></p>\n<p><em> Well yes </em> RT-5687 said <em> but don\u2019t you know that some think -- </em></p>\n<p>\n<em> Some think what? </em>\n</p>\n<p>Treachery. It tastes of copper blood, hot and salt in the mouth, and RT-5687 bites down on it.</p>\n<p>\n<em> That he was one of us. </em>\n</p>\n<p><em> Don\u2019t be </em> <b> <em>stupid.</em> </b></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>EG-5555 is known to her squad as Fiver. She is an excellent markswoman, her Aqualian heritage granting her better eyesight than most. It also gives her a frill of dry blue scales around her eyes.</p>\n<p>(In the Resistance there is a joke about humanity: they fuck anything that sits still long enough, even the things designed to prey upon them.)</p>\n<p>(A fact about Aqualians: they are sharp teeth and long venomous tentacles)</p>\n<p>(An achievement of an ancestor Fiver will never know: somehow impregnating a giant sea anemone.)</p>\n<p>\u201cThe traitor FN-2187,\u201d she spits, during a weekly Moral Meeting. \u201cHe was never a Stormtrooper. He was never one of <em> us </em>.\u201d Her squad nod around her.</p>\n<p>This is the truth. This is the truth they know. FN-2187 was not a normal Stormtrooper. He was a Resistance plant. He was a shapeshifter. He was a Bounty Hunter.</p>\n<p>He was, in short, anything but one of <em> them </em>.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s scum,\u201d agrees EG-7070. They call him Two Sevens, because nicknames are often in short supply -- this squad already has a Seven, a Sevener, a Seven-Seven, Big Seven, Little Seven and Medium Seven.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Was </em> scum,\u201d Fiver says. \u201cHe\u2019s dead.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d says Big Seven. She\u2019s shaven-headed and silver-eyed, black as night. \u201cNo, he\u2019s not. I was on a patrol on H\u2019Trakok, in the J\u2019Ara system, and we were told to keep an eye out for him. My, uh, my commander said that he had been seen on patrol in the area and we had to find him\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>Her voice trails off. Fiver wets her lips. She thinks of that trooper, the one people used to call Red because of her hair, the one who vanished along with her squad, dead in action.</p>\n<p>\u201cI heard,\u201d she says, treading soft, treading slow, words sneaking into the conversation, curling up from her throat, \u201cthat...that <em> some think </em> ,\u201d and here she stops. Treachery. It tastes of copper. It tastes of blood. She thinks of Red, of the squad that died on some backwater, of commanders who do not remember and Stormtroopers who never forget, because all that they own is what they see with their own eyes and hear with their own ears and even <em> then </em> they do not own these things, because Big Seven could -- if she was commanded to -- forget that she had ever been on patrol in some lonely planet in some lonely system --</p>\n<p>But she didn\u2019t forget. She is saying.</p>\n<p>And so Fiver says, \u201cThat some think that he was a Stormtrooper.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Medium Seven, EG-6777, wants to report her.</p>\n<p>\u201cSpreading dissent,\u201d he says. He\u2019s very young. His eyes are fiery with hate. He\u2019s got the words of the Order on his bones. \u201cIt\u2019s a dangerous, ridiculous lie.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stormtroopers do not have friends. Stormtroopers do not have sisters or brothers or family, and yet Medium Seven comes to Two Sevens before he goes to a superior -- not because of programming, but because it feels normal, it feels <em> right </em>, to discuss these things.</p>\n<p>Raised from birth to a chorus of propaganda, the song of war, and some things can never be crushed: namely the teenage urge to <em> \u00a0talk </em>.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt is,\u201d says Two Sevens, though he does not know precisely what Medium Seven means: the lie that FN-2187 was a Stormtrooper; that he is alive; that he escaped at all.</p>\n<p>There are many, many lies.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe should get her purged, for the good of the unit.\u201d</p>\n<p>Examples are what you make of them. Two Sevens thinks of TQ-7676. The holoboard. The steam coiling from broken white-black shells, like beetles smashed underfoot.</p>\n<p>The message: if one fails, we all fail.</p>\n<p>The lesson: if you see someone committing dissent, and do not report it, you are as guilty.</p>\n<p>The <em> actual </em>lesson: we see your unit as the same entity. All will account for the crimes of one.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m meant to outrank her. They\u2019ll blame me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Stormtroopers do not have friends. Stormtroopers do not have brothers. Stormtroopers, especially Stormtroopers like Medium Seven (baby fanatics with fire in their eyes and hate on their lips), obey without question.</p>\n<p>Medium Seven does not say a word to the officer when she comes for inspection.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Two Sevens is loyal to the Order. He believes firmly that they are in the right, that democracy is a scourge. He has fired his blaster into unarmed crowds, and he would do so again, but there is a kernel of...not doubt, not that, but <em> confusion </em>.</p>\n<p>Why are there so many stories of the traitor circling? Why can no one agree on what happened?</p>\n<p>Onboard the Finalizer, Kylo Ren throws a tantrum. This is not anything unusual.</p>\n<p>The difference: the red flash of his sabre curves through a command console and through Medium Seven. The boy dies between one breath and the next, his blood running red through the plates of his armour, smashed-beetle bright, and he smells of cooking meat.</p>\n<p>\u201cGet rid of that,\u201d Hux tells Two Sevens, flapping a hand at him. \u201cStop costing me <em> money </em>, Ren,\u201d says Hux, fallen soldier forgotten.</p>\n<p>Stormtroopers do not have friends. They do not have brothers.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Two Sevens is loyal to the First Order.</p>\n<p>He fires his blaster into unarmed crowds. He obeys without question.</p>\n<p>He tells nothing but the absolute truth.</p>\n<p>\u201cMedium Seven was the loyalest of soldiers,\u201d he says. \u201cHe served no other master but the First Order. He would have turned any of us in if he suspected us of treason.\u201d A pause. A weighted pause. In the dorms: Fiver with her strange, blue-frilled eyes; Big Seven with her calm certainty. Others: Sevener, Sevens, Bright -- a cruel nickname, for she is anything but -- Sharp, Spite, Shiner, Charm. Niner. Fives, Sixes, Thirds, Four-and-half.</p>\n<p>This is a eulogy. Eulogies are permitted. Eulogies are not treason -- how could they be? All Two Sevens is doing is speaking well of his model comrade. All Two Sevens is doing is highlighting the good of his service.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd he died,\u201d he says. \u201cHe died.\u201d</p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t need to say: Kylo Ren killed him.</p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t need to say: Hux asked me to get rid of <em> that </em>.</p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t need to. They know, they all know, and they raise their alcohol ration in a quiet, solemn toast.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI heard that FN-2187 was a Stormtrooper,\u201d says Fiver to him, three days later.</p>\n<p>He could say <em> that is not what I was told </em> . He could say <em> we do not speak of traitors </em> . He could say <em> once upon a time Hux\u2019s speeches were full of bile and hate for that man, and now he is not mentioned at all. </em>He could.</p>\n<p>He says, \u201cI heard that too. Who did you hear it from?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShe\u2019s dead now. Her entire squad as well.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI admire your comradeship,\u201d says Two Sevens, \u201cand I appreciate your presence in my squad. And I have heard that too. A lie, of course.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe need to make sure it has not spread. Has the rest of the squad heard it?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>They have.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>How could they just have vanished? </em>\u201d Hux shouts.</p>\n<p>Phasma shows her teeth. Her helmet is wedged against her hip. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she admits. Sleek chrome glittering in the sterile lights of the Finalizer. Hux\u2019s fists quivering at his sides. \u201cThree hundred and twenty six,\u201d she says, \u201cwe\u2019ve got back a hundred, but the rest --\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIn the scheme of things,\u201d he says, \u201cthat\u2019s not much. Right?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThere are two billion active Stormtroopers in our Empire,\u201d she says.</p>\n<p>\u201cGood,\u201d says Hux. \u201cGood.\u201d But there\u2019s a thin thread to his voice, a snag, a catch; the unspoken --</p>\n<p>Two billion. And what if they decide that they are not Stormtroopers anymore?</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHave you heard the rumour?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes. FN-2187 was a Stormtrooper.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNonsense, of course. Sedition.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDangerous sedition.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe was a traitor.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cA monster. I\u2019m escorting some cadets to their training planet. They would listen to such a rumour.\"</p>\n<p>\"They would listen readily.\"</p>\n<p>\"We much protect them at all costs.\"</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>They change the training routes. They have to. Five carriers full of soon-to-be Stormtroopers vanish in five standard months and that\u2019s a thousand\u00a0altogether, a\u00a0thousand children who will never march beneath the red and black banners of the Order.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cFN-2187 wasn\u2019t a Stormtrooper,\u201d says Blue to Green. She\u2019s named for the colour of her eyes; he for the strange ridge of scales he\u2019s got on his spine.</p>\n<p>\u201cNope,\u201d Green says to Blue. \u201cNot at all. Filthy rumour that. My troop don\u2019t know it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWill they?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t think so.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Green says to Tenner, his commander, \u201cThere\u2019s this awful rumour going round.\u201d</p>\n<p>Tenner says to Green, \u201cI\u2019ve heard it. Where did you hear it from?\u201d</p>\n<p>Green says to Tenner, \u201cIf I tell you, it needs to be on the condition that they\u2019re purged.\u201d</p>\n<p>Tenner says to Green, \u201cSure as the sun, they\u2019ll die.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"This is what we get for recruiting non-humans,\" says Commander Tarr. He's an avid humanist, and Hux hates him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Hux hates most people.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"Don't be an idiot,\" says Phasma. Hux doesn't hate Phasma. She's calm, despite everything, and her face is all hard lines. \"If we purge non-humans then we lose half our battle force. The defection of Blue and Green was nothing to do with their ancestry and everything to do with an unforgivable lapse in their programming. We need to investigate higher command.\"</p>\n<p>\"Don't be absurd. We can't investigate them; if we do then Ren will be up my arse. He's already looking for an excuse to cost me my command.\"</p>\n<p>Phasma's eyebrows scoot up. A red flush rides onto Hux's cheekbones. He's said too much --\u00a0<em>fuck</em>.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Things are slipping between his fingers. Stormtroopers are\u00a0<em>leaving</em>, and that's not meant to happen.\u00a0</p>\n<p>They're not meant to think for themselves.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"Right,\" he says. Fingers splay into his hair. \"We'll purge non-humans from higher command. Blame them for the spread of dissent.\"</p>\n<p>The art of compromise: no one is left happy.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Words have power. Words travel where nothing else can, hunting along the edges of space, bleeding into ships and minds and dorms, things that the Order thought it could shutter down. Hux does not speak of Finn anymore, and neither does anyone in power, but they do not need to --</p>\n<p>\u201cDid you hear --\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes. Awful rumour.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhere did you hear it from?\u201d</p>\n<p>And when a code is a code dreamed by one lone genius it can be cracked, but when a code grows organic from the hearts and minds of a people who have always been kept pressed down beneath high boots and white armour -- well, it is harder to trace.</p>\n<p>Stormtroopers are raised with a limited number of words. They are raised to speak a certain language, and they <em> still </em> speak that language --</p>\n<p>Purged: to be cut from the First Order.</p>\n<p>Killed: to cease to be a Stormtrooper.</p>\n<p>Hero: to obey orders.</p>\n<p>-- and yet.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>This is how the Resistance discovers that they have sparked a revolution: five carrier ships with an escort of a thousand TIE fighters materialise in Resistance air space.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Finn's woken by the wail of alarms. He leaps out of Poe's arms, dresses in a fumble, and races to the landing pad.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"Fuck, fuck, fuck,\" Poe pants. His eyes are wild and wide. TIE fighters in the sky, brighter than stars. Five carrier ships. That's five thousand, two hundred and twenty Stormtroopers. It's an invasion.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"Mobilise!\" Organa's voice rings out across base. \"Get to the X-Wings! Dameron, take black squadron --\"</p>\n<p>Orders barked out. The Resistance is nothing but organised. Every man and woman there knows their place.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Except Finn.\u00a0</p>\n<p>There's something wrong.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He stands there, in the centre of the storm, and he looks up, at the huge bloated moon of D'Qar and the TIE fighters like lost stars and the carrier ships, and his boyfriend is tugging his hand, trying to get his attention and --</p>\n<p>\"They would have killed us already,\" says the boy who had been a Stormtrooper. \"If they wanted to kill us, they wouldn't be waiting. Why are they waiting?\"</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The answer comes in the form of a broadcast, delivered in response to General Organa's demand that they identify themselves.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"Was FN-2187 a Stormtrooper? I heard he was. Is he?\"</p>\n<p>It's a woman's voice, trembling and very young.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Finn pulls the transmitter to his mouth. His lips brush it as he speaks. \"Yes. I was. I was, and I'm not anymore. My name is Finn. What's yours?\"</p>\n<p>The rush of static is a sigh of relief. \"They call me Fiver.\"</p>\n<p>\"Hello Fiver,\" says Leia Organa. \"Why don't you let me direct you to a more appropriate landing space?\"</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The Resistance changes over night.\u00a0</p>\n<p>A process is put in place, which is a fancy way of saying that the Stormtroopers -- all four thousand of them -- have to line up to have their minds read by Luke Skywalker to make sure they're not First Order spies.\u00a0</p>\n<p>That takes five days. By the end Luke is pale and shaking, ready to drop, but there's hope in his eyes for the first time in thirty years.</p>\n<p>\"Not one of them harbours any desire to harm us,\" he says. \"They want to see the Order fall.\"</p>\n<p>Fiver, who is leader by virtue of age and confidence, finds herself compelled to speak. \"More than that. We want Stormtroopers freed. No offence General, but I don't want to storm the Order if it means my kind are going to be cut down indiscriminately. There are so many of us, and so many of us --\"</p>\n<p>\"Who want to be free,\" cuts in Finn.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The look Fiver gives him can only be described as worship. The frills around her eyes flush a deeper blue. \"Yes,\" she says. \"Precisely. We are at your disposal, FN -- Finn, that is. Finn. Sir. Finn.\" She coughs.\u00a0</p>\n<p>She's looking at him like he's the sun -- that is, she's looking at him like he's too bright to bear, like she can't tear herself away.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"We only ask that, uh.\" She stammers a little, unused to making demands of those she believes outrank her. \"We only ask that the cadets be spared active combat. The eldest is but five rotations and they are not ready -- give them ten years and they will fight for you --\"</p>\n<p>\"Ten? They can have twenty. Thirty. They need never fight, if they do not wish to,\" says General Organa.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Fiver's mouth hangs slack. She tries several times to speak, and fails, and then she bursts into tears, pressing her face into her hands.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Finn pulls her against him. She shudders all over at the contact, cringing away and pushing closer at the same time.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"It's okay,\" he says, patting the sharp jut of her shoulderblades. \"It's all a little much, isn't it?\"</p>\n<p>\"You're FN-2187,\" she says, like a prayer. \"You were\u00a0a Stormtrooper.\"</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The first mission that Finn goes on is one of rescue.\u00a0</p>\n<p>It's fitting. Before he leaves, Poe kisses him long and sweet deep and tells him the story of his first meeting, a story of subterfuge and spying, hunting for information. \"You're the patron saint of revolution,\" he says, staring at Finn with such love that Finn shivers. \"You go and set them free, d'you hear me? You go look after them.\"</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>I'Tara is a training world, densely populated. The youngest troopers are stationed at the pole. They are kept warm by artificial atmosphere, and cordoned off, and Finn aches to rip away every soul on the planet but it is at the pole that their contact works.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"How do you know you can trust her?\" he asks of Fiver.\u00a0</p>\n<p>She turns her wide, blue-ringed eyes on him. \"I asked her if she had heard you were a Stormtrooper. She said she had; and that she believed it.\"</p>\n<p>There's utter conviction in her voice. The way she looks at him is akin to how Rey looks at Luke, or Poe at General Organa.\u00a0</p>\n<p>It makes him uncomfortable, to be the subject of such devotion.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He's tried to explain to them that he's not special, that he's no hero, that he tripped and landed in adventure -- but they won't believe him, they do not listen, and in the end Poe had taken him aside and told him to\u00a0<em>stop being so Force-damned modest. They love you because you're very loveable. And besides,</em> he had added,\u00a0<em>every revolution needs a figurehead.\u00a0</em></p>\n<p>\n<em>I don't want to be a figurehead!</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Wrong word. How about patron saint?</em>\n</p>\n<p><em>That's\u00a0<strong>worse</strong>\u00a0</em>but Poe had kissed him, and Finn can forgive Poe anything if it's followed by a kiss.\u00a0</p>\n<p>It's a devilish power that Poe is all too glad to exploit.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"Here,\" says Fiver. \"Here we land.\"\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0--</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Five thousand gone from I'Tara, basically overnight. Five thousand cadets. Ten\u00a0thousand are killed as one of the major barracks ignites in revolt. Two thousand arrested.</p>\n<p>Drops of water in an ocean, Phasma wants to say, but they both know that she doesn't believe it. \u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cKill them!\u201d Hux shouts, a high and desperate whine in his voice. \u201cGive the order -- blow up the planet!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThere are still two million cadets\u00a0there, sir,\u201d says Phasma. Her voice is level. Her hands are steady on her weapon. Her heartbeat is slow and sure. \u201cTwo million\u00a0cadets and five hundred\u00a0thousand two hundred --\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t care! If one rebels, they all will. We\u2019ll <em> fall </em> ,\u201d and he jabs one leather-clad finger against her breastplate. \u201cGive the order -- that is an <em> order </em>.\u201d And the jumble of words, and the wetness of his lips, and the wildness of his eyes. His hair, sweat-drenched, is bright as blood.</p>\n<p>\u201cFive hundred thousand\u00a0and twenty one soldiers,\u201d says Phasma. \u201cSir. Loyal soldiers, sir.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut they\u2019re not loyal, they can\u2019t be loyal, traitors come from their ranks and so they\u2019re infected as well!\u201d</p>\n<p>Wildness in his eyes and sweat in his hair and her blaster is heavy and familiar in her hands.</p>\n<p>\u201cKill them! If you don't, I'll get rid of you and find someone who will!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes sir,\u201d says Phasma.</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course sir,\u201d says Phasma.</p>\n<p>\u201cI only ever think of my troops,\u201d says Phasma, and shoots him in the head.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Phasma's hands shake. She drops her blaster on the floor, pulls her helmet off and tosses it aside. Her breathing is, as ever, slow and deep and calm.\u00a0</p>\n<p>There is absolute silence. Hux's body smolders. The reek of charred flesh and cooked blood fills the air.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Examples are what you make of them.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Phasma does not remember her parents. She does not remember a time before the First Order. The first hand she was offered smacked her down and pressed a gun into her chubby starfish hands and she has never, never known any other way.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"FN-2187,\" she says, aloud. Her right hand is starting to spasm. She sips in oxygen and her heart judders against her ribs and she thinks how she would wear her helmet at First Order functions, hating how people stared at her face. She thinks how she did as she was told, always as she was told; how she thought she was a Stormtrooper and nothing else.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The silence is an ache. It seems to continue forever.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Then there's a hiss. A click. A Stormtrooper removing his helmet. He's young. He wets his lips before speaking. \"Have you heard?\" he says. \"FN-2187...he was a Stormtrooper.\"</p>\n<p>There is always a choice, Phasma thinks. \"Yes,\" she says, \"yes he was.\"</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>General Organa almost has a heart attack. Poe draws his blaster, tries to put himself between the former Captain and Finn.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Finn, however, can never be held back. He steps forwards, offers his hand. Phasma hesitates a moment, then clasps it.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"I used to be a Stormtrooper,\" she says.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"Yeah,\" grins Finn, bright and wild as the sun. \"Me too.\"</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em> Here\u2019s a fact: you\u2019re all going to die. All of you. It\u2019s one of the only things we can be absolutely clear on. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em> Here\u2019s another fact: there\u2019s always a choice. Always. You\u2019ve been told that there isn\u2019t, and I can\u2019t blame you for believing that, but I\u2019m telling you here and now that there\u2019s always an alternative. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em> Fact: yes, death counts as an alternative. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em> Another fact: you are born, you die. The bit in the middle is yours. It\u2019s the only bit you get. Do with it as you will and don\u2019t ever forget the second fact -- </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em> I just said that -- </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em> Fine, here it is again: there\u2019s always a choice. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em> The last fact: FN-2187 was a Stormtrooper. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em> -- </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Cato Twelve, a planet with no strategic value, makes Hoth look like a pleasure spa from the Old Republic.</p>\n<p>The horizon is bitten up by mountains straining for the sky, the ground is iron-cold and the snow falls in greyish clots, coloured by the heavy volcanic activity to the south of the planet.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s the perfect place to make the transaction.</p>\n<p>\u201cForty three defectors, ma\u2019am,\u201d says Phasma.</p>\n<p>\u201cExcellent work,\u201d says General Organa.</p>\n<p>In a snowfield, there are two transports. Both are collections of rust and metal that look about five seconds from tumbling apart; the sort of things that smugglers who aren\u2019t too good at smuggling use.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt was not my work,\u201d says Phasma. She is wearing a heavy grey coat, hood pulled tight around her face, night-goggles obscuring any clue to her identity. \u201cThey escaped of their own accord and found their way to me.\u201d</p>\n<p>General Organa is similarly attired: not one scrap of flesh exposed to the elements. The wind is sharp enough to flay away skin in seconds.</p>\n<p>\u201cDisembark!\u201d Phasma calls, over the howl of the sky.</p>\n<p>A shuffling, shivering collection of one-time troopers totter down the ramp. They are bundled up in furs and fleece, in smuggler-garb and stolen First Order trench-coats.</p>\n<p>\u201cCome aboard,\u201d says General Organa. You can\u2019t see her face, but there\u2019s a strange note in her voice that Phasma still puzzles over. Phasma considers herself an excellent judge of character, and it irks her that much of General Organa remains inscrutable.</p>\n<p>(A fact Phasma doesn\u2019t know: that note is compassion.)</p>\n<p>One of the troopers lags behind. She\u2019s younger than the rest, thinner, and even in her layers and layers of fur she shivers. She has nothing to cover her face, and in half a heartbeat her white skin is red and raw.</p>\n<p>Once she was FG-4235, slated for termination; there\u2019s no point in a Stormtrooper who will not eat and who vomits up what she does.</p>\n<p>They call her Little One.</p>\n<p>Phasma shrugs off her coat. It is bantha-fur, heavy and rank, and without so much as looking at the trooper she drops it over her shoulders. Little One <em> oofs </em> at the weight, and peers up with frozen lashes and bleeding mouth.</p>\n<p>\u201cHurry up,\u201d snaps Phasma. \u201cYou\u2019ll get frostbite.\u201d</p>\n<p>Little One scurries to catch up, bundling the coat around her as she does so.</p>\n<p>General Organa\u2019s face and tone is, as ever, alien to Phasma. \u201cGood work Captain,\u201d she says.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m no Captain,\u201d says Phasma, \u201cnot anymore,\u201d but there\u2019s a kernel of something inside her, something warm and bright, and it disconcerts her because she has never felt its like before.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cCan I get a new name?\u201d says Little One.</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course,\u201d says Jena, once almost decommissioned for \u2018Unseemly Care Towards Inferior Species\u2019 and now acknowledged leader of the makeshift unit.</p>\n<p>\u201cCan you call me Phasma?\u201d says the trooper, the huddle of bones in a swamp of a coat.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWe didn\u2019t have a <em> choice </em> ,\u201d says a commissioned officer. \u201cYou understand -- you <em> must do </em>-- if I hadn\u2019t ordered the execution of the squad then I would have died as well, and I have a family --\u201d</p>\n<p>His voice is a high, irritating whine. Phasma shoves the barrel of her blaster against his temple, pulls the trigger.</p>\n<p>Charred flesh and cooling blood.</p>\n<p>She looks up. Behind him, huddled and awaiting execution, is the FC unit, all five hundred and twelve of them.</p>\n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s always a choice,\u201d she says. Her voice is trained to carry across battlefields and the screams of dying men. It reaches every corner of the vast jail quarters effortlessly. \u201cDo you understand that?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re Phasma,\u201d says one of the troopers at the front. He\u2019s older than the rest, with a scar that forces his mouth into a permanent sneer. \u201cYou shot my captain for trying to desert.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes. I did. FC-8758, known to everyone as Heartsore because she could recite the entire script of that cursed holofilm. Shot in the head, five years ago, on the planet R\u2019Thar. She tried to leave to be with a local she had met and fell in love with.\u201d She smiles at his stunned, slack expression. \u201cI do not forget. We cannot forget. We were Stormtroopers, and our memories are the only thing we can trust.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShe was a good woman.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI do not deny that. Here,\u201d and she offers him the blaster, safety off, handle first. \u201cTake your vengeance.\u201d</p>\n<p>He blinks. He stares.</p>\n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s a choice,\u201d Phasma says, \u201ca choice, always a choice. Now take your vengeance, or come with me.\u201d</p>\n<p>A choice, a choice, always and forever a choice, and the trooper shakes his head. \u201cShe called me Scarmouth,\u201d he says, instead, \u201cand I always hated it but --\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWelcome to the other side,\u201d grins Phasma, \u201cScarmouth.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>A fact: Phasma does not ever say <em> I\u2019m with the Resistance </em> because she\u2019s not, she knows she\u2019s not. She knows that there is not a place for her on D\u2019Qar; she knows that those who fly the X-Wings are those she used to gun down; she knows that she is a horror story (and she is a little proud of this fact.)</p>\n<p>A fact: she said <em> I only ever care for my soldiers. </em></p>\n<p>Something General Organa has noticed: Phasma says <em> soldiers </em> in the same way that she says <em> pilots </em> , in the same way Luke once said <em> students </em> and now says <em> Rey </em>.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>One day, after another batch of deserters have been sent on their way, General Organa says, \u201cWould you like a drink?\u201d</p>\n<p>They\u2019re on Ohsana, a smuggler\u2019s moon, land of scoundrels and battered ships and lost souls and there is no better place to find cut-price vodka, the sort that could be used to strip paint. Phasma knocks back a glass like water. The General matches her, and does not wince at all.</p>\n<p>They don\u2019t speak. They drink. After they\u2019ve finished a bottle between them, General Organa stands -- a little unsteadily -- and says, \u201cYou know, they speak highly of you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWho does?\u201d says Phasma, who is used to drinking far more, and far worse, and still finds herself warm and shuddery.</p>\n<p>\u201cYour soldiers. Do you know what they call you? Cap\u2019n of the Void. Wayfarer. Rescuer.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI am only doing my duty. I am doing what is right by my soldiers.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThey\u2019ve started naming themselves after you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Phasma\u2019s brow furrows. \u201cI do not understand. Why do they do this? Do you not provide a sufficient array of new titles to choose from? Would you like me to --\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh <em> hush </em>, Phasma. I\u2019ll see you next time.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou do not need to come in person. Surely the Resistance has better uses for its General than to see her sent to shitbucket worlds to accept a batch of deserters.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t need,\u201d says General Organa, \u201cand yet I do. That\u2019s what being a leader is about.\u201d</p>\n<p>She touches her palm to Phasma\u2019s cheek; she has to stand on tip-toe to do so.</p>\n<p>Then she is gone. Phasma has no time to contemplate what this means, what all of this means, for she has heard word that a half-dozen troopers have somehow found themselves aboard a slavers ship; and her duty calls.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to be part of the Resistance,\u201d says Vee-Vah and that\u2019s how it starts. She\u2019s named after the noise the Med-droid who treated her made. She lost her arm in her escape, and she\u2019s sick of the sight of blood. \u201cI don\u2019t want to stay on D\u2019Qar. I want to settle down. I want a family.\u201d</p>\n<p>She\u2019s the first. She\u2019s not the last, and soon the Resistance camp is buzzing.</p>\n<p>\u201cI mean,\u201d Sunlight says to Fiver, \u201cwe\u2019re not obligated to them, are we? We don\u2019t have to stay, otherwise we\u2019re just conscripts.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re not exactly <em> welcome </em>,\u201d chimes in Clover.</p>\n<p>\u201cCowards,\u201d says Shot-at-Dawn to Two Sevens. \u201cAll of them, bloody stinking <em> cowards </em> . How dare they not fight? Don\u2019t they understand what the First Order <em> does? </em>\u201d</p>\n<p>(Stormtroopers do not understand that some words are names and some are not. They understand that people name children after things and people they like, or are proud of, and Shot-At-Dawn takes a grim pleasure in contemplating what the First Order would do to him if he was ever recaptured.)</p>\n<p>(Two Sevens will not tolerate any other name but that given to him by a fire-eyed baby fanatic who did his duty and followed orders and still died and was thrown out of the airlock because no trooper is buried.)</p>\n<p>(Every member of the Resistance has a funeral. This is the reason that Two Sevens stayed.)</p>\n<p>\u201cThe children shouldn\u2019t be here,\u201d says Sunlight to Big Seven. \u201cWe said they don\u2019t have to fight, and they\u2019re growing up surrounded by battle.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat if the planet\u2019s attacked?\u201d says Big Seven to Fiver.</p>\n<p>And then, one day in the canteen: \u201cWhat if, what if,\u201d snaps Fiver, the scales around her eyes flushing royal-blue in her anger. \u201cWe owe the Resistance <em> everything </em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo we don\u2019t,\u201d Two Sevens says. \u201cWe owe FN-2187. I\u2019m loyal to him.\u201d</p>\n<p>Two Sevens is not well-liked. He\u2019s never shed his thorny, military demeanour; but when he speaks people tend to listen.</p>\n<p>Clover <em> is </em> well-liked. When she speaks, people listen as well.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The voices build to a crescendo and finally a compromise is reached: Ithaka.</p>\n<p>(The definition of compromise: nobody is happy.)</p>\n<p>Ithaka is a land of mists and swamps and iron-seas, an Outer Rim planet that no one\u2019s ever heard of.</p>\n<p>Those Stormtroopers that want to be free from the conflict head there in ships and droves. Big Seven takes a clutch of cadets. Clover takes her new husband. She\u2019s already swelling with child.</p>\n<p><em> When you leave, take with you all you love </em>.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s a lesson they learned in front of the holoscreens of the First Order.</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t like this,\u201d Rey says.</p>\n<p>\u201cThey must have a choice,\u201d Luke says. \u201cEveryone must always have \u00a0a choice.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMaster,\u201d says the second-to-last of the Jedi, craning her neck back, watching the vapour trails flutter into shreds in the blue, blue sky. \u201cThere <em> always </em>is a choice, I know that. It\u2019s just\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>She feels the Force. She feels it around her and in her, and she feels it ebb and flow and sing, and she feels the tentative hope of those troopers leaving, and she feels the pain of those left behind. She thinks that when Stormtroopers desert they almost always do so in units, in groups, in families.</p>\n<p>What it is to have people who love you.</p>\n<p>Luke takes her hand. She feels his pulse echo down his arm and into her, steady and grounding.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe make our choices, and we live with the consequences,\u201d he says.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t like this,\u201d says Poe. The Resistance is his home and his family and his everything. Leaving it is aborrence.</p>\n<p>\u201cI can understand it,\u201d says Finn. Finn, who dreams of open skies and children named after Poe,. Finn, the patron saint of revolution, who tripped and fell into glory. \u201cI mean -- they want a normal life.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo such thing,\u201d Poe says with a huff, drawing Finn down next to him. He plants a kiss above Finn\u2019s left eye.</p>\n<p>\u201cIf you could,\u201d says Finn, \u201cwould you? Go and have a family, get away from this?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve got a family,\u201d says Poe. \u201cAll noisy cousins and too many kids running around in the roots of the life tree. My home\u2019s never quiet -- it\u2019s exhausting. Nah, I prefer open space and an X-Wing and you,\u201d and he kisses Finn again, a question shaped by the push of his tongue and slur of his hands against Finn\u2019s naked chest.</p>\n<p>Finn pulls away. There\u2019s something sharp in his eyes. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t sound bad,\u201d he says. \u201cNot bad at all -- kids and family and\u2026\u201d his voice trails off. He shuffles up against Poe. \u201cBesides. What\u2019s a cousin?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWe need to turn them against him,\u201d says the newly appointed General Tarr. If they hate FN-2187 then they hate the Resistance, then they will not betray the First Order; they will stay where they are meant. Hux was always too gentle with the troopers. He was a cold fish. Too fond of non-humans. I have already ordered the purging of any with non-sapien ancestory,\u201d he says, like Ren agrees or cares. All are alike in the Dark Side. All have souls that flicker greasy-silver on the flank of dark. All are nothingness, atoms to be broken up, dust in the wake of those greater.</p>\n<p>\u201cI have a plan which I am sure the Supreme Leader will agree with,\u201d says General Tarr, with an oilslick smile.</p>\n<p>Once, there was a boy named Ben Solo and he sat on his father\u2019s knee one warm summer night, and fireflies danced glowing patterns into the blue of the sky. The father told the boy a story about a nerfherder -- a scruffy one! -- who was sick of the terranterrors preying upon his flocks so he set fire to the forest where they lived. All day and all night the fire burned, and in the morning the terranterrors were dead or fled. \u201cYour job is done,\u201d he said to the fire. \u201cYou can go now.\u201d And the fire had said: \u201cI like it here; I think I will stay.\u201d And it burned him right up, nerfherder and nerfs and all.</p>\n<p>Ben Solo\u2019s mother had said, is this really a story for children? but Ben hadn\u2019t listened. He was too intent on the fireflies. He held up a hand, focused, and their flight changed, forming the wobbly letters of his name --</p>\n<p>Ren\u2019s teeth clack together. The end of his tongue is severed in a spurt of blood.</p>\n<p>Ben Solo is dead and gone, fireflies and father and all.</p>\n<p>\u201cI will confer with him,\u201d says Kylo Ren.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Ithaka burns.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>Ithaka burns, and it is not the bright red flare of Starkiller, planets fracturing into hot dripping lava, people turned to dust in a heartbeat, breath caught and never drawn again. It is slow. It is fire. It is weapons lined up from space firing down, beams of heat, tectonic plates cracking asunder, heartbeat of the planet exposed raw and red and glowing, it is a sky the colour of blood and corrosive rain that strips flesh to bone. It is screaming agony to the sky, it is every Force user in the galaxy waking sweating and weeping. It is a planet of refugees boiling alive, it is hellfire, it is slaughter, senseless and mindless slaughter.</p>\n<p>It is the Resistance, they say.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIt was a foul and cowardly attack,\u201d says General Tarr. His voice rings to every corner that the Order occupies, and beyond. \u201cThe Resistance pretended to give the Stormtroopers a choice -- fight for them, or settle on a planet in the Outer Rim. They promised that those who did not fight for them would be spared. They lied. This morning, fifty ships stolen from our armoury were sighted in the Outer Rim; they had been taken by the deserters, and now they were turned upon their comrades. They destroyed the planet and any life on it. The deserters upon Ithaka did not die easily. They burned alive. This is a clear message from the Resistance, intended to warn any who refuse to join their ranks.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThey were Stormtroopers,\u201d says General Tarr. His eyes are cold. His hands clasped at the base of his spine. His face is red and flushed, with passion or rage. \u201cAnd they were murdered.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cEvidence,\u201d says Tarr to Ren, after the broadcast. \u201cThat\u2019s what Hux lacked. He had this notion that people listen to words alone, that troopers were mindless -- they\u2019re not. I wish they were, but they\u2019re not. We give them evidence, and they respond.\u201d</p>\n<p>Ren is silent. He is thinking of the flare of Starkiller over Hux\u2019s face, the fury. He is thinking of Hux\u2019s thorny dignity and sharp pride and brilliant, brilliant mind.</p>\n<p>Tarr is not as clever as he thinks he is.</p>\n<p>\u201cThose ships were very well guarded. I wonder how they got into the hands of lowly troopers?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what you mean,\u201d says Tarr, clipped and curt and if Ren wanted he could scoop out his thoughts, leave him a gibbering senseless wreck. The thought makes him smile beneath his mask. \u201cThe Resistance did this.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cVery well,\u201d says Ren. Last night, he had dreamed of fire. He had bitten through his lip to keep himself from crying out.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Rey stumbles into Finn and Poe\u2019s quarters, red-eyed and shaking. \u201cThey -- they -- they\u2019re dead -- they\u2019re screaming -- oh Force, I hear them --\u201d and her hands, her soft clever hands, reach for her hair and yank like she can rip the voices from her head. Finn \u00a0snaps awake, reaches for her; she collapses against him, so very small, sharp scavenger edges. \u201cThey\u2019re dead, they\u2019re all dead,\u201d she whispers into the curve of his neck, curling inwards like she can somehow escape whatever is grasping at her if only she makes herself small enough.</p>\n<p>Poe knows better than to say it was just a dream. He flicks the light on, and Rey cringes further against Finn.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d he says.</p>\n<p>Rey coughs and coughs and manages, \u201cIthaka. Ithaka, it\u2019s burning.\u201d</p>\n<p>Land of swamp and mist, land of iron seas and birds with five wings. Unknown to the First Order, unknown to anyone --</p>\n<p>Only not anymore.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt burned,\u201d says Rey, again. Tenses jumbled up. Did it happen or didn\u2019t it? Is it happening, or has it happened, and it doesn\u2019t matter which for she can\u2019t stop it and she can\u2019t save them and judging by the look on her face she does not realise that she\u2019s said all this aloud.</p>\n<p>Finn cups her tear-struck face in his hands, smooths his thumbs over her cheeks and kisses her above the left eye, then above the right, and she sounds like she\u2019s choking on blood, like she\u2019s been shot in the stomach, and he kisses her soft wet mouth and tastes copper where she\u2019s bitten through her lip.</p>\n<p>Poe huffs and Finn thinks<em> oh shit I\u2019m not meant to kiss her </em>-- but then there\u2019s a rustle of fabric, of sheets sliding free, and Poe is tugging them both down, arranging Rey between them. She turns, huddles up against Finn, her shoulderblades jabbing against his chest, her arms reaching for Poe. He clutches at her, presses himself to her, anchoring her. \u201cYou\u2019re here with us,\u201d he says. \u201cYou\u2019re here. You\u2019re here.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Word spreads quickly on the Resistance base, where mess halls are full of chatter and newly released Troopers, and within three hours everyone knows: Ithaka burned. Ithaka burned .</p>\n<p>Two Sevens punches a wall. He doesn\u2019t know why. He\u2019s never been one for tantrums, and he\u2019s never had a temper, but all the pain floods him and overspills and he punches a wall and all that happens is he splits open his knuckles and bleeds red as the skies over Ithaka, and a hard broken sound forces through his throat.</p>\n<p>\u201cThey were meant to be safe,\u201d he says. His hand hurts. His throat hurts. His eyes are a dry burn and once upon a time he was loyal to the First Order, once upon a time he shot striking miners without question and now he is here, bleeding from the hand, thinking of how many children were on that planet, how many conscripts, how many lives.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>They were meant to be safe, says Two Sevens to Shot-At-Dawn.</p>\n<p>They were meant to be safe, says Shot-At-Dawn to Charred and Chancer and Choice. They were meant to be safe, they said they would be safe, those who did not want to fight, says Chancer to Choice, and Chancer was the only one from her unit to choose to come to the Resistance and now everyone she left behind is gone and she\u2019s cursing herself for forgetting the rule that every defecting trooper learned from the holoscreened executions --</p>\n<p>\n<em> When you leave, take with you all you love. </em>\n</p>\n<p>And Charred says to Choice, and Choice says \u00a0to her unit -- fifty strong -- and one, a young man named Lighthands, says how did they find it? We were told Ithaka was safe, we were told that no one outside the Resistance knew where it was and they found us still, they found us.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The question: who can we trust?</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Finn doesn\u2019t know how to give speeches, and yet it seems to be expected of him. He is, after all, the patron saint of revolution.</p>\n<p>That title -- once spoken in affection -- sickens him now, weighs heavy on his shoulders. He is unworthy. He isn\u2019t a soldier, he isn\u2019t a leader, he isn\u2019t like Poe or Organa or Rey. He\u2019s just...just a Stormtrooper.</p>\n<p>He started this. He couldn\u2019t save them.</p>\n<p>He stands before the assembled crowds, the Resistance and the defectors. More Stormtroopers than one might think. Not all had gone to Ithaka; many had wished to remain and fight, and Finn is suddenly glad of this -- though at the time, when thousands of curly-haired tots had asked him to teach them to shoot, he had been heartsick.</p>\n<p>Anger swells within him, a depthless and blinding rage. He opens his mouth. He will stir them up, he will pledge vengeance against the First Order, he will tell them that whoever gave the order will die, that whoever flew those ships will die, that he will not rest until Ithaka is <em> avenged </em> --</p>\n<p>The words die on his tongue.</p>\n<p>He looks at them again. Faces and faces and faces, nothing hidden, nothing concealed. Some are scarred, some are young, some human and some not, men and women and everything in between. At the front: General Organa, Luke Skywalker, Rey, Poe. Behind them: the blue-scaled Fiver, surrounded by a swamp of baby cadets (they're called littleones, and they hate it, and everyone calls them it regardless).</p>\n<p>There had been children on Ithaka.</p>\n<p>Most are here. But there had been <em> children </em> there, and --</p>\n<p>He finds himself looking at Rey and Poe, thinking of the taste of Rey\u2019s blood on his lips, the warmth of her hand in his, the slump of Poe\u2019s jacket on his shoulders, the way Poe curls around him at night, the way Rey looks at him, gentle and a little wistful, like she\u2019s contemplating the horizon.</p>\n<p>Finn swallows thickly.</p>\n<p>\u201cMy name is Finn,\u201d he says, unnecessarily. \u201cI was a Stormtrooper. We all were. And so was...\u201d</p>\n<p>And just like that, he knows what to say.</p>\n<p>\u201cRed. Red II. Jumper. Dancer. Vee-Va. Silver. The Cold One. The Warm One. Singer. Storyteller. Big Seven. Sevener.\u201d</p>\n<p>Names. The names of the fallen.</p>\n<p>\u201cSunlight. Lightdance.\u201d</p>\n<p>Rey stands. She climbs onto stage next to him and winds her fingers through his, turning to face the crowd.</p>\n<p>\u201cClover,\u201d she says, \u201cFinn the Second. Finn the Third.\u201d</p>\n<p>Poe joins them, leaping up onto stage with the flourish of a pilot, taking Finn\u2019s other hand. \u201cChewie,\u201d he says. \u201cHan,\u201d because Stormtroopers did not always understand names, but they understood enough to know that people were named after heroes.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a disturbance towards the side of the crowd. Someone\u2019s pushing their way through. Finn doesn\u2019t pause in his recitation -- he couldn\u2019t, even if he wanted to -- but he recognises this one. Feral-mouthed, tall and lithe; Two Sevens, who doesn\u2019t get on with anyone.</p>\n<p>Two Sevens hesitates for a moment, poised at the front of the congregation. His hair is white blonde, a clumsy spill over his eyes, and he looks very very young.</p>\n<p>Then his jaw tightens, and he steps forward. \u201cMedium Seven,\u201d he says. His voice is low and rough and earnest. \u201cTrilla. Pansy.\u201d</p>\n<p>Organa is next. \u201cPella. Stormer.\u201d</p>\n<p>Then a woman\u2019s voice from somewhere in the depths of the gathering, calling out: \u201cDaisy! Hawthorn!\u201d</p>\n<p>A man\u2019s voice: \u201cShiner!\u201d</p>\n<p>And then they are all talking at once, all reciting the names of those they knew and those they lost, and the noise builds and ebbs and flows, sometimes a susurration and sometimes a yell, waving lower and higher, thousands of voices gathering together, singing up towards the cold, distant stars.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Afterwards.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe need to find who did this,\u201d says Rey.</p>\n<p>\u201cI know where \u00a0to start,\u201d says Poe.</p>\n<p>The lining of Finn\u2019s throat feels like it\u2019s peeling loose in long red shreds. His tongue is gluey from speaking too long, and he forces himself to breathe in and out, in and out, names rattling in his skull.</p>\n<p>\n<em> Red I. Red II. Blue.Sunburst. Starlight. Heart. Dotty. Leia. Organa. Organa II. Han-Solo. </em>\n</p>\n<p>It\u2019s a long time before he can speak.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Within three days, Captain Phasma has arrived. General Organa summons Finn, Rey, Poe and Luke to her quarters -- and they find Phasma kneeling.</p>\n<p>\u201cI was the only one who knew the map to Ithaka,\u201d she says, without preamble.</p>\n<p>\u201cDid you do it?\u201d</p>\n<p>Rey and Finn stare at him. Poe shrugs. It\u2019s a valid question.</p>\n<p>\u201cI do not remember the three hours between eighteen-oh-hundred and twenty-one-hundred on the seventh day of the last lunar cycle,\u201d she says. \u201cEverything else is accounted for, save those three hours, and I can only assume that the Knight of Ren --\u201d her voice catches. She shows her teeth. \u201cI should have reported this at once. I should have turned myself in for cleansing -- but there was a training squad coming in and --\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe takes what he wants,\u201d Rey cuts in. Her eyes are flinty and Poe looks at her, iron-hard feral desert child, the girl who takes wreckage and makes it anew, the girl who has a garden behind her bunker on D\u2019Qar, who coaxes bright flowers from wet soil and, yes, this is a girl you fall in love with and never let go. She\u2019s shining. She\u2019s burning, burning up, and sometimes Poe feels like he\u2019s changed to two comets, yanked through the firmament, planets spinning below, destiny a hard and relentless drumsong on his flesh and --</p>\n<p>\u201cI want you to do it,\u201d Phasma says to General Organa. \u201cPlease, all I ask is that you find a worthy replacement -- \u201c</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to kill you,\u201d says General Organa, flatly. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t your fault. It was...it was Ren\u2019s fault. He did this.\u201d Something haunted and dark steals across her face. \u201cThere\u2019s a choice, always a choice, and he <em> chose </em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re not doing enough,\u201d Finn says suddenly, rudely. \u201cWe can\u2019t just keep waiting for them to find their way to us; we need to <em> drag </em> them here. We need to get the word out.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI agree,\u201d says Phasma, and that\u2019s something Finn never thought he would hear from her. \u201cWe need to encourage larger defections. This serves the dual purpose of weakening the First Order and strengthening our own forces -- what?\u201d says Phasma, unnerved by the fact that everyone in the room is now looking at her.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou said <em> we </em>,\u201d says General Organa.</p>\n<p>\u201cAh.\u201d Phasma coughs. \u201cWell -- yes. I would...that is. If you'll -- if you\u2019ll have me -- because this -- this is --they were <em> innocent </em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWelcome to the Resistance, \u2018ma,\u201d says Poe, slapping his hand onto her shoulder. He has to stand on tiptoe to do so.</p>\n<p>She glowers at him. \u201cNever call me that again.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSure thing,\u201d says Poe, with a grin that could swallow the sky.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Later that night. Poe\u2019s room, Poe\u2019s bed, but not just Poe; Rey\u2019s there as well, slanting sharp against Finn\u2019s right shoulder, her leg hitched up over his, the points of her toes nudging Poe\u2019s calf. Poe. against Finn\u2019s left side, his hand slung up over Finn\u2019s chest so his fingers can toy with the ends of Rey\u2019s hair.</p>\n<p>\u201cShall I tell you a story?\u201d Poe ventures, after a while. \u201cMy mother used to tell me stories about the old legends before she went out for a mission. It used to calm me down.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe don\u2019t <em> have </em> a mission,\u201d Rey says, sharp and bitter. \u201cWe don\u2019t have a <em> plan </em> . We\u2019ve...we\u2019ve just got a planet full of hate and pain and sorrow and I can <em> feel </em> it and Master Skywalker\u2019s no help at <em> all </em> --\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe used to recite Hux\u2019s speeches before we went to sleep,\u201d Finn interrupts. \u201cI never listened to the words, just the voices -- it was nice hearing everyone speak aloud. You, uh. You didn\u2019t hear it much. The speaking aloud that is. People didn\u2019t want to speak to me. Troopers, that is. It\u2019s funny. I can\u2019t go outside without someone coming up to me -- they used to salute until I made them stop, and I think that someone started a rumour that I like flowers now they all give me random bits of plant.\u201d</p>\n<p>Rey huffs laughter. \u201cThat\u2019s lovely,\u201d she says. Then, \u201cGo on Poe, tell us a story.\u201d</p>\n<p>Poe sits up, shuffles back and plonks himself down in the middle, crushing Rey\u2019s arm in the process. She yelps, hits him, and he tussles with her playfully, angling himself over her -- <em> on top of her </em> -- and a warm burst of <em> something </em> blooms in Finn\u2019s stomach.</p>\n<p>Rey relents, peers up at Poe through the disarray of her fringe. He stamps a kiss to the uptilt of her nose and slumps down again.</p>\n<p>\u201cRight,\u201d he says, a little out of breath. Rey rubs her ankle against his knee. Finn, on impulse, reaches out and catches her foot, runs his thumb under her sole, and draws her leg up so together they cage Poe. \u201cOnce upon a time,\u201d he says, \u201cthere was a beautiful princess called Leia\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>When he\u2019s finished, Rey\u2019s frowning.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s not how I heard the story,\u201d she says. \u201cYou missed out the bit with Jabba the Hutt.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWho's that?\u201d says Poe.</p>\n<p>\u201cUh\u2026\u201d says Finn, because he\u2019d been thinking that too -- Stormtroopers hear a <em> very different </em> version of that story.</p>\n<p>Rey has no qualms about speaking her mind: \u201cI heard that she smothered him with her breasts in the throes of congress. I mean,\u201d she adds, at Poe\u2019s horror-struck look, \u201cI know it isn\u2019t true, but that\u2019s what I heard. Funny, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t think sex with a Hutt is <em> funny </em> --\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNot that! The fact that it\u2019s a different story depending on who told it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d says Finn. \u201cI, um. I heard something different. About, uh. Boba Fett and Princess Leia and apparently she sold herself to him and got dumped for giving him syphilis and <em> I know that didn\u2019t happen </em>,\u201d for Poe looks perhaps five seconds from converting to the Dark Side, \u201cbut that\u2019s what I heard.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s what you heard,\u201d says Poe. He sounds like he\u2019s mulling the words over, tasting them.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat if,\u201d Rey says, \u201cwhat if everyone was told the same story? At the same time? What if it <em> couldn\u2019t </em> be distorted? Luke says that he can feel the hatred of the troopers even here; they\u2019re burning up with stories of Ithaka and the innocent who died there. But we know that the First Order did it and...what if we could tell them? All at the same time?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat would be wonderful,\u201d says Poe. \u201cBut unless you\u2019re <em> really </em>good at the Jedi Mind Trick I don\u2019t see how -- \u201c</p>\n<p>Finn bursts out laughing.</p>\n<p>The other two stare at him like he\u2019s finally cracked. Maybe he has.</p>\n<p>He kisses Poe hard on the mouth. Then, for good measure, he kisses Rey.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve got an idea!\u201d he says, and bolts from the room.</p>\n<p>Rey and Poe lie there, tangled up and speechless -- but only for a moment -- for they have spent the very best bits of their lives with Finn, and they have no intention of letting him escape for long.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhen I was a Stormtrooper,\u201d says Finn. \u201cMy squad hated me. I mean, really hated me -- I didn\u2019t fit in, I was too nice -- <em> anyway </em> , they used to threaten me with transfer to the <em> Messenger </em>. No one wants to go there; it\u2019s the most boring place in the galaxy. It\u2019s located in the centre of First Order airspace, It is dedicated entirely to sending out the daily broadcasts. It isn\u2019t heavily protected. All it does is take in signals and send them out again -- not encrypted ones, no, nothing so important. Messenger deals entirely with the blunt, everyday sort of propaganda. The sort of propaganda that says FN-2187 was not a Stormtrooper and The Resistance burned Ithaka\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s where they send the daily speeches out from,\u201d says Phasma. \u201cEvery day, every single port and ship and planet in the Order gets the same message. Speeches, generally, but sometimes propaganda films.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cExactly,\u201d says Finn. \u201cEvery day, every place, the <em> same message </em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo you\u2019re saying,\u201d Rey says, \u201cthat if we could get there we could hijack the signal and broadcast whatever we want?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell. Yes. But you couldn\u2019t just go in there -- it\u2019s in the middle of the Order -- you\u2019d have to be <em> insane </em> --\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Ladies and gentlemen, presenting: Poe Dameron, certified madman.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>OQ-2411 does not like Morning Moral Meetings. This is not because she dislikes the speeches -- she finds them comforting -- but because it is one of the few times that higher officers and Stormtroopers mix and it is when Captain Jael can see her.</p>\n<p>Even when she\u2019s in her armour, caged and supposedly safe, Jael picks her out.</p>\n<p>Fingers pressing into the joins of her armour. A sly, quick smile. A puff of hot breath into her mask, hands either side of her helmet, a slick of black-haired Captain smirking at her and OQ-2411 thinks of showers and surprise inspections and wants to die.</p>\n<p>She\u2019s a trooper. She\u2019s nothing. She\u2019s told no-one because everyone knows that Captain Jael has a habit of picking out pretty troopers and taking an interest until the trooper does something wrong, or says something wrong, and then they\u2019re off on some mission to the back end of nowhere and they're never seen again.</p>\n<p>Today, Jael is fiddling with the holoscreen. It isn\u2019t co-operating. Her slim white hands push at the cables, and she curses under her breath.</p>\n<p>\u201cCharmer!\u201d Jael calls and OQ-2411\u2019s stomach curdles, sweat congealing under her armour.</p>\n<p>She hates that name. Hates it.</p>\n<p>\u201cC\u2019mere. Help a girl out.\u201d</p>\n<p>And OQ-2411 does, for she has no choice, and she\u2019s taller than the Captain and can reach up to shove the wires back into place and Jael taps long red fingernails on her breastplate and says, soft and hungry, \u201cAfterwards, you\u2019ll report to my quarters,\u201d as she\u2019s done before, and OQ-2411 salutes.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes Ma\u2019am.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Colonel Archer kicks the holoscreen. It flares into life. He doesn\u2019t pay the speeches any attention, not anymore, because he\u2019s thinking of Stormtroopers dying. It\u2019s funny. He never really thought of them as people -- they weren\u2019t people, they were tools, they were white masks and flat black eye-holes and sharp salutes and numbers -- but --</p>\n<p>The children of Ithaka. General Tarr says it a lot. He\u2019ll probably say it in today\u2019s speech, red abhorrence flaring on his cheeks, coughing out words like bullets. Firing up the troops, he calls it. Saturate them with hate, point them at the enemy.</p>\n<p>Tarr deals in hate.</p>\n<p>(When Archer was young, before he learned to kill without ever getting blood on his hands, his mother told him a story. It was about a Princess, who had a land plagued by rebels. The rebels stole her crops and ate her people up, and all she wanted was to get rid of them, so she set a fire. The fire climbed into the rebels houses and burned them all up, and in the morning the princess asked the fire to go.</p>\n<p>I will not, the fire had said, I like it here and it had burned the Princess up as well, land and crops and people and all.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a lesson there, Archer thinks. Maybe.)</p>\n<p>(Or maybe it's just a story.)</p>\n<p>(Or maybe it's both.)</p>\n<p>Anyway. The children of Ithaka.</p>\n<p>The funny thing: he\u2019s never thought of Stormtroopers as children before.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>In mess halls. In hangars. On planets and in training facilities, in the morning and at night and in the middle of the day, all over the would-be Empire, all at the same time.</p>\n<p>General Hux had arranged for them to be shown in the morning. General Tarr altered this. Regimentation, he had said, that\u2019s the key. All at the same time -- everyone stops and hears him speak.</p>\n<p>He likes that: the fact that everyone must inconvenience themselves to listen to him.</p>\n<p>It demonstrates his power, he thinks.</p>\n<p>Kylo Ren thinks General Tarr has much to learn about power.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>OQ-2411.</p>\n<p>Colonel Archer.</p>\n<p>TR-0001, who is the oldest Stormtrooper in her unit and knows that soon her joints will fail and she will be decommissioned and no Stormtrooper ever gets a grave.</p>\n<p>Marksman, named for the only notable thing he can do: kill things with accuracy.</p>\n<p>Kits. KO-8763, who no one likes, Stunner who everyone does -- named because she is a little too fond of her electric prod -- and Captain Jael, and more. Millions. Billions.</p>\n<p>Some are loyal, some not, and all sit down to watch at the same time and what they hear is what was broadcast from the Messenger and that is --</p>\n<p>\u201cHi. Uh. My name was FN-2187, and I was a Stormtrooper.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Finn doesn\u2019t know how to make speeches. It\u2019s an artform that makes very little sense to him. All he can do is all he\u2019s ever done; he says who he is, and what he is, and he does not stop.</p>\n<p>\u201cIthaka burned. It burned down to the ground and it was full of refugees, children and noncombatants, and the First Order deployed their ships and pretended that it was the Resistance. You may not believe me. You don\u2019t need to believe me. I just need to tell you the truth, and I need you to listen.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Afterwards, in the control room of the <em> Messenger </em>.</p>\n<p>Phasma says, \u201cI don\u2019t know why I had to speak,\u201d and she sounds almost <em> petulant </em>.</p>\n<p>\u201cBecause they need to understand that we don\u2019t just kill people,\u201d says Poe. And then, because he\u2019s an arse, he adds, \u201cMa.\u201d</p>\n<p>She hits him.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh <em> Force </em> you broke my <em> kidney </em> --\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShut up!\u201d Rey flings a hand out towards the dashboard.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a light beeping. On and off. On and off.</p>\n<p>Incoming signal.</p>\n<p>\u201cOpen up the comm-link,\u201d says Rey, and with a flicker of fingers Finn obeys.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHi!\u201d It\u2019s a girl. She\u2019s in the beetle-shell white of a trooper, helmet off, red smeared down her face. Her lip is split open but she\u2019s grinning. \u201cAre you the Resistance?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d says Finn. \u201cI\u2019m -- \u201c</p>\n<p>\u201cI know who you are. You\u2019re FN-2187, you were a Stormtrooper, you\u2019re...you\u2019re <em> wonderful. </em> I\u2019m OQ-2411...I don\u2019t have a name, not really, but I\u2019ve just killed my superior officer and I really think we need to get out of here. What coordinates are safe?\u201d</p>\n<p>Finn\u2019s not fast enough. Rey elbows him aside, fingers rattling on the keys. \u201cHere,\u201d she says. \u201cCan you steal a ship?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got one,\u201d says the girl. \u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cRey. Is everyone --\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCall me Rey. I\u2019m Rey. I\u2019m Rey and I just killed Captain Jael. Gotta go!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>She goes, but in half a heartbeat another comms-link is open. This time it\u2019s a red-haired trooper with a First Order officer under her arm. \u201cI\u2019m Osma. We\u2019re coming,\u201d she says, without preamble. \u201cBut we\u2019re bringing this bastard with us.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFor trial?\u201d asks Rey.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo! This is Colonel Brendol Archer. He\u2019s a bastard but he\u2019s <em> our </em> bastard. When the Captain tried to turn off the message he shot her! He\u2019s...he\u2019s one of the good ones.\u201d</p>\n<p>Colonel Brendol Archer does not look happy. His eyes are wide and fretful, his mouth a hard line, but he still manages to sketch a salute -- despite being in a practical headlock of what Finn presumes is soldierly affection. \u201cI will submit to the firing squad,\u201d he says, \u201call I ask is --\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh what is <em> with </em> you First Order idiots? You\u2019ll get a trial if necessary. If your troopers are vouching for you then that\u2019s good enough for me --\u201d</p>\n<p>Archer squirms free. \u201cSo, um. You don\u2019t kill officers on sight?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNope,\u201d says Phasma. \u201cOnly the ones I don\u2019t like --\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBy which she means everyone gets a fair trial and no one is shot at dawn and no one is tortured and -- <em> what are you doing </em>--\u201d for Archer is reaching for his comms.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat do you think? Spreading the word. Do you know how many of us fight to the death because we think that you\u2019ll skin us alive and rape our corpse if we\u2019re captured?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUh,\u201d says Poe.</p>\n<p>Osma squeals in delight and ruffles Archer\u2019s hair. It sticks up in black scuffs, and he glowers like a cat dunked in water.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou need a new name,\u201d she says. And then, to Poe, \u201cWhat\u2019s yours, handsome?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m Poe Dameron -- \u201c</p>\n<p>\u201cThere you go! You\u2019re Poe. Now hurry up.\u201d</p>\n<p>The screen flickers black, but the lights keep on coming: message after message after message.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>On the planet D\u2019Qar, under a star-strewn sky, the not-quite-last Jedi takes his sister\u2019s hand.</p>\n<p>\u201cCan you hear it?\u201d he says.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d she says.</p>\n<p>\n<em> Ma. Osma. Poe. Rey. Fighter. Flighter. X Wing. Stormer. Hansolo. Jenna. Kyra. </em>\n</p>\n<p>Names. Billions crying out their names to the void, new names to replace the old, a song without end.</p>\n<p>Leia squeezes Luke\u2019s fingers, and together they listen.</p>\n<p><br> <br> <br> <br> </p>\n<p>Janus II is an industrial planet, the sky curdled yellow, three suns hidden behind bruised clouds. Its capital, Claudia II, is a city-vast factory, spires thrusting hungry and sharp into the belly of the atmosphere, millions bent-backed over weaponry and droid-parts and ships.</p>\n<p>On the flank of one of the warehouses, someone has spraypainted: FN-2187 WAS A STORMTROOPER.</p>\n<p>\u201cWho\u2019s FN-2187?\u201d says a worker, moth-pale and only tangentially humanoid. Their name is Janus Worker 23-45, Second Class.</p>\n<p>\u201cDunno,\u201d replies their companion. He\u2019s of a species that has been all but wiped out by the First Order, a genocide so thorough that he doesn\u2019t even know what his people were named. People know him as Janus Worker, 98-35, Third Class.</p>\n<p>They go into work. As ever, the day begins with a speech from High Command. It will be, as it always is, on the importance of productivity, on the great service they do for the First Order.</p>\n<p>Except this time it isn\u2019t.</p>\n<p>By the end of the day, 23-45 and 98-35 have discovered the following things:</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>KIlling General Tarr is not victory. It is duty. It is a pleasant duty, but it is not victory, for killing the man does not unmake the mistake. Billions are in open revolt. Billions more are tied up trying to quash the revolt, but they cannot be trusted.</p>\n<p>No one can.</p>\n<p>Master Snoke tells him he must find time for himself, and so he spends three days with General Tarr, drawing out his death, asking him again and again --</p>\n<p>\n<em> Did you not think? Did you not think? The children of Ithaka, the children of Ithaka -- did you not think that Stormtroopers are NOT CHILDREN NEVER CHILDREN and you have made them THINK THEY ARE PEOPLE -- </em>\n</p>\n<p>Afterwards, Ren goes to meet Tarr\u2019s \u00a0replacement. He does not bother to wash. He stinks of blood, and his bootprints are red.</p>\n<p>The newly appointed General Asric is in her late forties, grey-haired and hawk-featured and proud.</p>\n<p>Ren drops what is left of Tarr at her feet. Her aura -- a flat, iron grey -- flickers red-gold with fear, but quiets in moments, and her lips curl into a sneer.</p>\n<p>\u201cI will do better than my predecessor Lord Ren,\u201d she says. with a respectful tilt of the head.</p>\n<p>Perhaps Kylo Ren can get along better with this one.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Callimina Archer has seen more battles than she can name, and so when word gets to her that a gaggle of Stormtroopers are revolting she does not panic. This is no different to any other failed rebellion -- of which there have been plenty -- and so she pulls on her officer blacks and summons her daughters to her office. It\u2019s the most secure room in the house.</p>\n<p>\u201cRemember your brother,\u201d she tells them, \u201cremember your father: they died for the First Order. You do their memory proud.\u201d</p>\n<p>She sends out a comm for Captain Thresh, the head of their personal guard.</p>\n<p>He does not answer. Another voice, one she doesn\u2019t recognise, says, \u201cWas he a Stormtrooper?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI <em> beg </em> your pardon?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFN-2187. Was he a Stormtrooper?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo! He was rebel scum, as are you, and you are all going to die --\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell,\u201d says the trooper, \u201cyes, we are. Everyone is born, and everyone dies, and what you do in the middle is down to you. Now, I know you\u2019ve got kids, so I\u2019m going to ask you again -- <em> was FN-2187 a Stormtrooper? </em>\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cToo bad,\u201d says the trooper. The comms link goes dead.</p>\n<p>\u201cMother,\u201d says her youngest, Cosetta, \u201cMother, what\u2019s that smell?\u201d</p>\n<p>Smoke starts to coil under the door. Callimina rushes across her office, her coat a black flare behind her, and types in the code to open it with shaking fingers.</p>\n<p>The pad beeps once, and dies. The lights flicker off and the room is plunged into velvet blackness.</p>\n<p>\u201cThey\u2019ve cut the power,\u201d she whispers.</p>\n<p>\u201cMother I smell <em> burning </em>,\u201d wails Cosetta. Her elder sister shushes her.</p>\n<p>\u201cMother, there\u2019s backup supplies aren\u2019t there?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThey should have kicked in by now. They must have taken out the entire grid. Don\u2019t worry my darlings,\u201d she says, \u201cand do not cry -- we are of the First Order, and we never show weakness. This will blow over -- we are safe in here -- nothing can get through that door --\u201d</p>\n<p>An explosion sounds, hard and ragged, and Cosetta screams.</p>\n<p>\u201cThey\u2019ve got to the armoury,\u201d Callimina says. \u201cThey\u2019ve got --\u201d</p>\n<p>Light, sudden and blinding, and Callimina knows no more.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cMaster Luke is calling me back,\u201d says Rey. \u201cI have to return to complete my training. Apparently.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, <em> yeah </em>,\u201d says Poe, because if she expects him to disagree she doesn\u2019t know him at all. He cups her face in his palms. She brings her own hands up, curls them over his wrists. There is something about her fingers that makes him think of knives, and he kisses each one. \u201cYou\u2019re our best shot against Snoke and Ren. If you think we\u2019re going to let you get killed out here, you\u2019re mad.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI want to stay with you,\u201d she says.</p>\n<p>Finn brushes her hair from her nape and plants a soft kiss where her jaw meets her throat. \u201cI know. But you can\u2019t. You\u2019ve got to go. Get strong. Get strong enough to stop him.\u201d</p>\n<p>Rey kisses Poe, hard and fierce, teeth and tongue and <em> claim </em>-- and she snaps around and does the same to Finn, biting his lower lip so hard she draws bright blood. Feral desert child she is, she laps it from her teeth and snarls. \u201cI\u2019ll kill him for you two. My boys. My beautiful boys.\u201d</p>\n<p>Fever-flare of a girl in his arms, lightning trapped into slender bones, thunder-white skin and a throat made for battle-hymns. Poe\u2019s so in love he could die. He catches the bird-sharpness of her hips, pulls her into another kiss and Finn pulls her dress off her shoulders and, well, what transpires next is for their eyes only.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m Break-The-Door-Down,\u201d says the Stormtrooper. \u201cBecause,\u201d he adds, in the laboured tones of one who has had to explain his name ten thousand times over and expects to continue to do so, \u201cI was the one who got into the armoury on Thalia Five..\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m Bren,\u201d says the Resistance fighter. He\u2019s got unkempt black hair and sparking grey eyes and the sort of smile that suggests he knows precisely when the world is going to end. At the mention of <em> Thalia Five </em> his smile wavers, just a little. \u201cWe all get new names. We all start again. Bren was what my littlest sister called me, before she learned to pronounce my proper name.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI never had sisters,\u201d says Break-The-Door-Down.</p>\n<p>\u201cI have four. Don\u2019t know where they are now. Probably the Academy. All the girls from my family were sent off to fight. Anyway. Let\u2019s get you settled in. I\u2019m your Captain now. I\u2019ll take care of you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Ren snaps awake, his hand reaching for his lightsabre. He ignites it, and scarlet light dances off bedsheets and black walls and --</p>\n<p><em> Hux </em>.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re dead.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI see you are as quick-witted as ever. You\u2019re dreaming.\u201d</p>\n<p>It is something of a departure from his normal dreams, which almost always feature fire and charred red skies.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m here to tell you a story,\u201d says Hux.</p>\n<p>\u201cIf I am dreaming, then I do not have to listen. Good night, General.\u201d</p>\n<p>Ren flicks the lightsabre off and lies back down.</p>\n<p>Tries to.</p>\n<p>His bed is gone. He stands on white, shifting sands that stretch to a curving horizon, where purple sky meets the cool flank of the desert.</p>\n<p>General Hux <em> tsks </em> in that way that always made Kylo Ren want to tear his tongue out through his teeth. \u201cI\u2019m here to tell you a story, and you will listen to me.\u201d</p>\n<p>He\u2019s in his high boots and black greatcoat, the one that flares out at the back, like an echo.</p>\n<p>\u201cFine,\u201d says Ren. He\u2019s accustomed to stranger dreams, after all. \u201cWhere are we?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMy home planet.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYour home planet is Thalia Five. It has no deserts.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOnce upon a time,\u201d General Hux starts, ignoring Ren totally (much in the way he did when he was living), \u201cthere was a young prince. He had a name, but no one remembers it. He was just a prince. And in his kingdom there lived a great and terrible dragon --\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDragons are not real.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShut <em> up </em>. This dragon ate up his villagers. It ate up his wife. It was so big and fierce that nothing in the land could face it. In despair, the prince crept to where the dragon was known to sleep. He had in his possession a magical liquid that burned without end --\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c--so speeder fuel?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI will <em> gut you </em> . Shut <em> up </em>. He set a fire and it ate up the dragon, scales and wings and all. And he said to the fire, go from this place I have no more need for you. And the fire said, I go where I please, and it ate up the prince, kingdom and castle and all. Do you understand?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m sure I have heard this story before -- \u201c</p>\n<p>\u201cYes. You have. Kylo. <em> Listen </em> , for Force\u2019s sake I am begging you <em> listen to me --\u201d </em> and it isn\u2019t Hux, it isn\u2019t Hux at all, it\u2019s a young man with a scruff of long brown hair and strange, yellow eyes and there\u2019s something really -- <em> achingly </em>-- familiar about him, only --</p>\n<p>The desert is falling away. The sky is bleeding dripdripdrip<em> sllide </em> --</p>\n<p>(ithaka burned and that was because of you --)</p>\n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s a choice,\u201d says the man who isn\u2019t Hux, who is caught between Hux and someone else, face running like wax or paint or blood. \u201cThere\u2019s always a choice. Kylo? <em> Ben --\u201d </em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>On the side of the governor\u2019s house on the rural planet of Blake-717, someone has spraypainted FN-2187 WAS A STORMTROOPER. In the streets, Stormtroopers run riot.</p>\n<p>In the morning, GQ squad, who apparently stayed loyal, will scrub the paint off. They will round up the tatters of YH squadron and they will shoot them in the streets, the words of the First Order on their lips: treachery is a tumour and we will carve it out.</p>\n<p>Just before lunchtime, their captain meets with an unfortunate end. He is crushed beneath a ruined TIE fighter.</p>\n<p>Just <em> after </em> lunchtime, a new captain is appointed: GQ-9831, a promising young soldier with a sterling record.</p>\n<p>In the afternoon, GQ squad will follow her onto a ship, ostensibly to carry on the good fight, for the training planet Ronan is igniting in a fire-fight between the barracks that have stayed loyal and those that have not.</p>\n<p>GQ squad never get to Ronan. \u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The latest deserters show up sleep-sore and bloody-handed.</p>\n<p>\u201cSir!\u201d barks the captain, a woman who reminds Finn a little of Phasma, in that she\u2019s over six foot and terrifying. \u201cGQ squad, wishing to defect. We can fight for you --\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOr not. Down to you, really. What\u2019s your name?\u201d</p>\n<p>The captain flusters. Her head quirks on one side and she says, \u201cThey know me as -- knew me as -- GQ-9831 but I never -- I never had a nickname, it was unprofessional it was -- \u201c</p>\n<p>The Stormtrooper at her left, a skinny boy of no more than nineteen, slaps his hand onto her shoulder. \u201cYou saved us,\u201d he says, \u201cso let\u2019s call you Finn.\u201d</p>\n<p>There are a lot of Finns.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Of course, not everything is perfect. Integration is hard, and the lines may be fused by the crucible of warfare but there are cracks --</p>\n<p>\u201cFucking <em> bastard </em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCall me that again -- I dare you -- I <em> dare you --\u201d </em></p>\n<p>\u201cStormtrooper, Empire-loving <em> bitch.\u201d </em></p>\n<p>Shannah Yzetta is a veteran of the wars against the Empire. He\u2019s grey-haired and grizzled and wiry, wolfish strength and he is very, very drunk.</p>\n<p>Two Sevens is younger and stronger and not drunk at all, and his eyes are filled with fire.</p>\n<p>\u201cShut up.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMake me. I saw your type all the time. I\u2019ve shot you all my life, spent all my life shooting people like you -- fuck it, you ain\u2019t people. You\u2019re numbers. You\u2019re fuckin <em> nothing </em>--\u201d</p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t get to finish that sentence.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s hard to speak when you\u2019re choking on your own <em> teeth </em>.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNow, if we just restrain ourselves,\u201d says Archer, all prim and proper, straight-spined and glowering. Two Sevens bristles behind him.</p>\n<p>Shannah\u2019s mouth is pulverised: it looks like a split-open fruit. His teeth are the seeds, hanging loose.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou could have killed him,\u201d Archer continues.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd what in Force\u2019s name were you thinking?\u201d Pava says. She\u2019s holding the pilot -- ostensibly to keep him back, but really to keep him on his feet, because it turns out that drunk veteran will always lose to angry young soldier. \u201cThey\u2019re our allies. Two Sevens is a good man.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAin\u2019t a man,\u201d says Shannah. \u201cAin\u2019t nothing.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cKindly shut the fuck up,\u201d says Archer.</p>\n<p>\u201cMake me, First Order bitch. Didya take it up the arse from General Hux?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo. I did go to school with him. You see, where I come from we attend school.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cArcher! Not helping!\u201d for Shannah is starting to struggle anew, and Pava can\u2019t blame him: in that moment Archer\u2019s all First Order snobbery, imperial tilt to his chin.</p>\n<p>\u201cAn\u2019 you come from somewhere where they kill children!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes! I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve heard the rumours -- but <em> so do you!\u201d </em></p>\n<p>\u201cCalm <em> down </em> ,\u201d Jessika pleads, and Archer subsides. Two Sevens clamps a hand onto his shoulder in the universal gesture of <em> he\u2019s not worth it bro. </em></p>\n<p>And then -- \u201cFuck you! And fuck FN-2187, the cunt who brought you here.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSo he fell down the stairs to his bunk?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cRepeatedly,\u201d says Jessika..</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd landed on his face.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYup,\u201d Archer says.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd testicles.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat too,\u201d chimes in Two Sevens.</p>\n<p>General Organa raises one indomitable eyebrow. \u201cI understand your need to defend your friend, but do try and avoid causing grievous harm to those you are meant to be fighting with.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI am nothing but loyal to those on my side,\u201d says Two Sevens.</p>\n<p>\u201cOne would hope you are loyal to the Resistance,\u201d says General Organa.</p>\n<p>\u201cIsn\u2019t that what I said?\u201d Two Sevens replies, with an insolence that reminds her of her husband. A bolt of sorrow strikes her spine.</p>\n<p>\u201cGo! And stop making trouble.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cEverything you are,\u201d says Snoke, his hand gentle on Kylo\u2019s hair, \u201cis what I made you. You are a wonder. You are a weapon more powerful than any Starkiller. You are storm and silence and <em> power </em> and the pinnacle of the Dark Side. <em> My </em>pinnacle,\u201d he adds, and gestures for Kylo to stand.</p>\n<p>Kylo does so. They are aboard <em> The Citadel, </em>Snoke\u2019s crowning glory: a ship of such intricate design that they say it drove its maker mad. It drifts through First Order airspace, undetectable, shielded so thoroughly that Resistance pilots have flown beneath it and not realised its presence.</p>\n<p>\u201cThank you Master.\u201d</p>\n<p>Once, Snoke towered above Kylo, as imposing as the sky. Now, they are of a height. Still: Ren feels like the smallest of children in the weight of his presence, the superior power of his Master pressing down on his own Force awareness, solid as durasteel clamps around his wrists and throat.</p>\n<p>\u201cTell me, child. What are the nature of your dreams?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI dream of fire and of blood, of our galaxy burning. It is madness.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt is. And tell me how we cease this madness.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBy ruling it. All things are mad, unless they are under your control.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em> Our </em> control.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOurs,\u201d says Ren. \u201cOf course.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou are troubled,\u201d observes Snoke as he turns back to his throne. \u201cYou taste blood in your mouth -- \u201c</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, I do not. I <em> want to </em> . The galaxy is in chaos, our Stormtroopers in open revolt, planets declaring themselves for the Resistance. <em> Entire planets </em> . That cursed broadcast -- <em> FN-2187 is a Stormtrooper </em> ,\u201d and Ren\u2019s voice slants higher, aping Finn\u2019s earnest, bright speech, \u201c <em> and you can be too -- you can be free too! </em> It\u2019s revolting -- and we permit it to continue! Let me go out Master, let me <em> kill them </em>--\u201d</p>\n<p>Snoke lifts his hand. At once the ever-present manacles tighten, and Kylo clatters to his hands and knees, gasping for breath. Hot, hideous fingers prise open his mind, catch his throat in a sickening clutch, and his world goes white with pain.</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t question me, child,\u201d Snoke says, gently rebuking. He sits down. Kylo bites through his lower lip to keep himself from screaming. \u201cAll I do is for your own good. You know this.\u201d With a wave of his hand he releases Ren: the man gasps in air, his teeth red in the half-light of the throne room.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes Master.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou will swing the balance of the Force to the Dark Side. You will echo for ten thousand years. But you must do as I say -- and I say that the time is not ripe, and you are not ready to face Skywalker.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThen let me kill FN-2187, or his friends,\u201d says Kylo. Blood dribbles down his chin. \u201cLet me kill them. Let me, at least, kill the scavenger girl.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI do fear I have spoiled you. I admire the strength of your hunger, but you must practice a modicum of self control. \u201cYou will kill them. They will weep and beg for the mercy of death and you will not deliver it, and you will allow them to see the destruction of their beloved, and then you will grant them the mercy of the final blackness -- but <em> not yet </em> . And do not fear for the First Order. The Dark Side grows strong with hate and <em> oh </em>how the galaxy fills with hate -- can you not taste it?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhen I wake,\u201d says Ren, \u201cI taste blood.\u201d</p>\n<p>Snoke smiles. \u201cLet me tell you something. Why are revolutions called revolutions?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI do not know.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBecause they <em> always come round again </em>. We will emerge from this revolution stronger than ever. Now, leave me. I would be alone.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Leia and Luke and Phasma stand in General Organa\u2019s bunker, in the centre of a camp that has swelled in size ten times over, and ten times again, since the broadcast from the <em> Messenger </em>. There are similar encampments all over the skin of D\u2019Qar, and other bases spot around the galaxy, hidden away and known only to a few. Almost overnight, the Resistance went from being a rag-tag group of pilots and madmen to an enterprise the size of the universe.</p>\n<p>\u201cThey are killing children,\u201d Luke says. \u201cI feel it. Last night, a group of troopers sealed the doors of an officer training academy and burned it down -- the youngest was fourteen.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course they are killing children,\u201d Phasma snaps. \u201cDo you not know anything about the training of troopers? The youngest one I saw executed was four. <em>Four</em>. Troopers, especially ones that are only just defecting, have no <em>notion </em>of the rules of warfare you enjoy prattling about. They do not see a fourteen year old officer -- or would-be officer -- as a child; they see a threat; and they act to eliminate the threat.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cStill,\u201d starts Luke, but Phasma isn\u2019t finished --</p>\n<p>\u201cThe Jedi took children when they were barely off the teat. Do <em> not </em> preach to me Skywalker, especially about the well-being of my troopers. But rest assured, the practice will slow and halt in time. With Finn\u2019s example, they will learn the rules of civilisation.\u201d</p>\n<p>The wonders of the modern world, Leia thinks. Captain Phasma telling her brother of the virtues of civilisation.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt is quieter without him,\u201d says Leia.</p>\n<p>\u201cI do not miss the cries of <em> FN-2187 was a Stormtrooper </em>that heralded his emergence from his bunk,\u201d says Phasma, \u201cand I feared the start of a religion around him...but yes, I must concede that the boy\u2019s absence is tangible.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you mean that you miss him?\u201d</p>\n<p>Phasma glowers. Leia beams, and pats the back of her hand.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt is necessary. He is a figurehead. He must be where he can do the greatest good. One benefit of his absence is that the pilot is with him,\u201d continues Phasma, \u201cfor if he had called me <em> Ma </em> one more time then -- and I regret to say this, General -- I would have shot him.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI fear for Rey,\u201d Luke admits. \u201cHer training is not yet complete, but she is deeply distracted. She misses her boys.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShe must stay here, you said so yourself. She\u2019s too valuable to allow to run around willy-nilly.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes. It\u2019s just...I feel her pain.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cStudents learn nothing from being coddled,\u201d Phasma says. \u201cYou must know this. Students need regimen. They need attention. They need discipline and a task to perform, and -- why are you smiling?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cJust thinking,\u201d says Leia, \u201cthat Poe has given you a rather apt nickname.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Finn never stops moving. He is in a bar on Ohsana, standing on a chair before a crowd, electric thrum of violence kept at bay by virtue of his reputation and Poe\u2019s easy smile. He\u2019s onboard a ship that\u2019s five seconds from meltdown, troopers training blasters on each other. He\u2019s there when Jadqara surrenders wholesale, and he\u2019s there when the industrial world Kygo Beta is incinerated by the First Order fleet. He\u2019s there when a little girl shoots her captain. He\u2019s there when a Mandalorian bounty hunter is shot by Poe, moments before he completes his mission.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s there -- but he\u2019s also in dorms and barracks, on battlefields and in alleyways. His name is spraypainted on streets. His name is carved into bunks. His name is worn by rebellious First Order officers, badges tucked secret and sly into collars and sleeves. His name is on the lips of Alacia Brackenwater, who is shot for high treason when her mother catches her telling the story of <em> FN-2187 who was a Stormtrooper </em>to her four year old cousin.</p>\n<p>It frightens him: the responsibility. It weighs on his shoulders, heavy enough to snap him asunder, but he must bear it -- he <em> must </em>-- for he is Finn who was FN-2187, who was a Stormtrooper.</p>\n<p><em> You\u2019re my patron saint </em> , Poe croons to him at night, patching the words to some old Republic ballad. <em> You\u2019re my patron saint of salt and stardust, my saint of revolution </em> -- and he draws out revolution into its damn near erotic, curled and crisp -- <em> my song and my sky with no pollution -- </em></p>\n<p>Nonsense words. But they\u2019re words of love and that matters more than he could ever say.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Luke and Rey sit at the edge of camp, where shadows tangle in the light. Above, the sky is milky purple, D\u2019Qar\u2019s vast moon gliding ghost-pale on a froth of white cloud.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m <em> ready </em> Master,\u201d she says. \u201cI wake up every morning with blood in my mouth, and it belongs to those people I can\u2019t protect. I hear them screaming. I hear them <em> singing </em> . Please let me go and join Finn and Poe, let me go and <em> fight </em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo. You aren\u2019t ready. You are not capable of handling yourself in another confrontation with Ren -- and rest assured, the instant you start involving yourself in this war he will sense you and he <em> will </em>come for you.\u201c</p>\n<p>\u201cWith all due respect, Master, I have handled myself for long before you came along.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI know. Everything you are is your choice. And if you were to leave...I cannot stop you. I would not stop you. I just fear for you.\u201d Luke seems to age fifty years in a single breath. He rolls his eyes skywards. \u201cI wish I could protect you from what awaits.\u201d</p>\n<p>Rey takes his hand. It took her a little while to get used to physical contact. She still remembers the snatch of panic in her chest when Finn grabbed her hand -- in Jakku, people who try and touch you almost always mean you harm. And yet in this new world in which she finds herself, people touch freely, and find comfort in it, and so she takes Luke\u2019s hand and raises it to her mouth and kisses his knuckles.</p>\n<p>As she does so, she feels the flutter of his Force awareness at the edge of her skull, gentle as a frill of summer wind. She nudges back against it, opening her mind up to him --</p>\n<p>-- and at once, all at once, she topples over, flooded from spine to sinew with a sense of guilt so profound she cannot speak. Her eyes spring open, wide and white and wild with panic and --</p>\n<p>\u201cRey!\u201d Luke slaps her across the cheek. His face is a white smudge in the dark.</p>\n<p>Why is it dark? It was evening, it was --</p>\n<p>She\u2019s on her back, staring up at the stars. Her mouth is full of blood -- she\u2019s bitten into the tip of her tongue, almost clean through.</p>\n<p>\u201cHere,\u201d Luke says, and rips open a translucent Medi-Pad. \u201cOpen.\u201d</p>\n<p>Rey opens her mouth, and he tucks the dressing onto her skin, and in a blinking the wound has gone.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI am so sorry,\u201d says Luke. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat <em> happened? </em>\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou entered my mind,\u201d he says. \u201cI only meant to offer you comfort, but you -- you went deeper --\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThen <em> I\u2019m </em>sorry. I didn\u2019t mean --\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo matter. It did not bother me.\u201d But his eyes, his eyes are wet. \u201cWhat bothered me was that you were screaming, and I could not help --\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re a good man,\u201d she says. \u201cI know you think you\u2019re not, but you are, and what Kylo -- what Ben -- did wasn\u2019t your fault. It <em> wasn\u2019t </em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI permitted Snoke into my Academy. I believed him when he spoke of balance in the Force. I -- \u201c</p>\n<p>\u201cIf you had scraped the inside of his head out, he would still have hidden his intentions from you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI should not have trusted him!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd Ben shouldn\u2019t have stabbed Han and he did; and he shouldn\u2019t have become Kylo Ren and he did; and he shouldn\u2019t have let them burn Ithaka and he <em> did </em> . There\u2019s a choice, Master, always a choice and what you have to remember -- what you <em> must </em> remember -- is that Kylo Ren <em> chose </em> . And so did I. <em> Everything I am </em> I made for myself. Same with him. Same with <em> you </em> . <em> Please </em> stop blaming yourself and <em> start </em> letting yourself do things.\u201d</p>\n<p>She hesitates. Runs her tongue over her lower lip, ponders the wisdom of saying what she now knows -- and then it occurs to her that he probably knows it anyway. The joys of Jedi mind powers. \u201cI know why you don\u2019t want to go out and fight. It\u2019s not because of me. It\u2019s because you\u2019re worried that you\u2019ll fuck up again. You\u2019re worried you\u2019ll get me killed. But you <em> won\u2019t </em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>She reaches for his hand, and presses her forehead to it. He reaches out with a tentative hand and strokes her hair.</p>\n<p>\u201cThank you,\u201d he says, so quietly she can barely discern the words.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Ask Poe Dameron what victory looks like and he will say this: the Resistance, bright and shining, red-black banners burning up, stacks of TIE fighters forming the funeral pyre for the First Order, Snoke -- that shadowed, hallowed nightmare -- hauled into the sun and burning up at the touch; fire and phoenix and rising, rising, rising; song and dance and the heady thrum of <em> life </em> , singing from one end of the galaxy to the other. The song of the Resistance, incorrigible and unconquerable; Finn under his left arm, Rey under his right; warm press of their mouths against his -- and against his <em> other bits </em> -- and joy everlasting.</p>\n<p>Ask Luke Skywalker what victory looks like and he will say this: there is balance. Nothing is wholly good and nothing is wholly bad, but there is an equilibrium. He does not wake bathed in sweat, he has his sister at his side, and Rey as his bright-eyed padawan, and he can start to rebuild.</p>\n<p>Ask Phasma what victory looks like and she will say this: the campaign is concluded; the next battle will start in our favour.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Here\u2019s an experiment.</p>\n<p>Ask Kylo Ren.</p>\n<p>He wouldn\u2019t be able to say.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>There are no Stormtroopers onboard <em> The Citadel </em> . There are only the Knights of Ren, and their Master, and <em> his </em> Master -- and the Master of the Knights of Ren is looking out at the vastness of space and thinking of a child\u2019s story.</p>\n<p>Someone, a very long time ago, told a weak, stupid boy a tale about a nerfherder, and his nerfs, and fire. Fire that ate everything up</p>\n<p>(nerfherder and nerfs and all)</p>\n<p>because of course it did, that\u2019s what fire does.</p>\n<p>Fire can\u2019t be controlled or caged or <em> stopped </em>.</p>\n<p>It just <em> is </em>.</p>\n<p>It does as it wills. It does whatever it wills. This is the nature of the Dark Side as well.</p>\n<p>At least, he thinks.</p>\n<p>He thinks it is.</p>\n<p>He does not know anymore.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Ren walks past two of his brother Knights. They bow, one knee clacking to the floor, and on impulse he seizes one of them by the robes and hauls him into the air. He forces his way into the man\u2019s skull, tastes his thoughts, thoughts of bloodshed and slaughter on distant planets, of women screaming and children breaking into wet bundles of blood and bone --</p>\n<p>\u201cLord,\u201d says the other. \u201cLord, what are you <em> doing?\u201d </em></p>\n<p>\u201cIt ate him all up,\u201d Kylo says. He holds the Knight in his mind. It is so easy. \u201cIt ate him all up and said <em> yes I shall stay here you will not command me.\u201d </em></p>\n<p>He <em> clutches </em> and the Knight\u2019s pain shudders to a halt. He hangs slack in the air.</p>\n<p>Kylo drops him.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe was weak,\u201d he says to the other Knight. \u201cHe sought out those who could not fight back, unworthy opponents, and he felt guilt for his actions. I will purge such weakness from my order.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lessons are subjective. Examples are only what you want to make of them.</p>\n<p>You cannot teach those who will not listen.</p>\n<p>Darth Vader\u2019s redemption came from behind his helmet. He <em> chose </em>. Luke did not foist the choice upon him. He couldn\u2019t. No one can.</p>\n<p>There is a choice. Always.</p>\n<p>And Kylo Ren thinks of a dead man, of a dead man who had once had a son, a man who had said --</p>\n<p>\n<em>Snoke is using you for your power. When he is done with you, he will crush you. \u00a0</em>\n</p>\n<p>Dead man can be right.\u00a0</p>\n<p>You can learn from history.\u00a0</p>\n<p>(there is always a choice)</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHave you heard?\u201d says Kylo Ren. \u201cOnce upon a time there was a scared old man. He was sensible, and the universe was mad, and he wanted the universe to make sense so he didn\u2019t have to be scared anymore. And the old man was very strong, but the universe was stronger, and so the old man found a little boy and set him on fire. And the boy burned up, and the boy burned up all the madness in the universe, and the old man was satisfied and said to the boy: you will go away now, you are not wanted.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd the boy said, why am I not wanted? I have done all that you have asked of me\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd the man said, yes you have and now you will go away. i do not want you; you will go.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd the boy said, I am fire, and I do as I please. And he burned the old man up, skin and bones and fear and all.\u201d</p>\n<p>Kylo Ren lifts Snoke\u2019s head higher, trying to remember how tall his Master had been. The eyes are slack, the mouth hanging open. Brackish blood splatters onto the floor.</p>\n<p>The Knights of Ren hold back. They have their lightsabres out, singing scarlet death, but none of them stirs forward.</p>\n<p>Ren wiggles his hand. Snoke\u2019s head lollops to and fro.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd the old man was burned up,\u201d says Kylo. \u201cSkin and bones and all.\u201d</p>\n<p>With this, he drops the lump of flesh, wiping his hand clean on his cloak, mounting the stairs to where Snoke had once sat.</p>\n<p>\u201cThere is always a choice,\u201d says Kylo Ren.</p>\n<p>The Emperor takes his throne.</p>\n<p><br> </p>\n<p>\n<span>When Kylo Ren comes home, there is blood on his hands. \u201cMother,\u201d he says, and his voice threatens to crack open. He hisses in a hard, sharp breath. \u201cMother -- I am sorry. I...I -- there is a choice, always a choice, and I chose wrong and I am </span>\n<em>\n<span>so so sorry</span>\n</em>\n<span>,\u201d and his great shoulders shake, and he kneels to the woman he made a widow, to General Organa, and she catches his chin with her palms and presses her forehead to his. She feels the throb of his heart, as she once felt him stir in her womb. She feels his depthless, yawning guilt, vast enough to swallow all the stars in the sky. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cBen,\u201d she whispers, \u201coh Ben, I forgive you, I do,\u201d and behind her, wavering like the shadow of D\u2019Qar\u2019s moon come dawn, Han Solo smiles as his family reunite. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>It\u2019s hard, of course. Rey does not like him, and Finn shows his teeth, and Poe draws his gun. But with time, and with love, she knows that her family will learn to function again. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>He killed Snoke, after all. He killed Snoke, and the song of the Light inside him is louder than ever, burning away the shadows and in time, in time --</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>--</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>That\u2019s not what happens. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Of course it isn\u2019t. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>--</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>But for one moment, just one moment, the barest breath of time -- nestled between one heartbeat and the next -- Leia believes that it could happen. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHan,\u201d she says, \u201coh Han,\u201d for the Force is strong with her, and it calls the news to her bones, \u201coh Han, he killed him, he killed Snoke,\u201d and she remembers Ben at seven, in the Academy, a long-limbed man called Snoke watching him train, she remembers Ben at five, curled against her and crying from his dreams, she remembers kissing away the glitter of his tears, telling him that everything was going to be okay --</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>-- and for one moment, just one moment, it is. Snoke is dead. She feels the universe heave a great sigh. She feels the Force lurch from side to side, like an ocean in flux, and she feels the absence of darkness, a hole that could be filled with light --</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>-- only it isn\u2019t. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHan, our Ben is </span>\n<em>\n<span>home</span>\n</em>\n<span>,\u201d she says, but even as her lips form the </span>\n<em>\n<span>h</span>\n</em>\n<span> of </span>\n<em>\n<span>home </span>\n</em>\n<span>the surge comes again, and it is fire and it is pain, and it is --</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>It is --</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Leia\u2019s eyes are pinned open wide, wide, wide as the vision overtakes her. Snow an iron cascade, some planet with no name, gnarled trees grasping at the grey belly of the sky. Rey, her hair a frosted mat, her lips bleeding, her eyes wet, the glow of Luke\u2019s lightsabre casting sick green shadows over her face. She looks half-dead. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>At her feet. Snow a bloody, churned slurry. The dance of fighters ripping up the earth. Corpses littering the ground, eyesockets filling up with white. Poe. Finn. Luke. Phasma. Broken, crooked bodies. Charred lines. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cBow to me,\u201d says Kylo, says the boy who was Ben, says the man who has made his choice. \u201cBow to me, and I will spare you. I will teach you.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI\u2019ll never bow,\u201d Rey shouts back. \u201cI\u2019ll die before I bow, I\u2019ll </span>\n<em>\n<span>die</span>\n</em>\n<span> --\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThen so be it,\u201d says Kylo Ren, and he does not dance or parry: he thrusts once, and Rey\u2019s breath is punched from her lungs, and she slides off his sabre in a heap of burned and useless flesh. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cMother,\u201d says Kylo. His mask is gone. His face is the one she has known and loved for thirty years. His smile is entirely his own. She wishes his expressions were warped and cruel; she wishes that he was scarred, burned up, veiled. But he isn\u2019t. He\u2019s her son. He\u2019s her son. \u201cMother, let me tell you a story. Once upon a time there was a woman, and she had more children than she ever knew, only she failed them all. And they died. And she did not. She watched them die, and she failed them, and she lived a long, lonely life and there was no end.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>--</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>A warm scream fills Leia\u2019s throat as she jerks awake. Luke\u2019s hand finds hers, fingers knotting tight. \u201cI felt it too,\u201d he says. \u201cI felt it.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cMe too,\u201d and there\u2019s Rey, small sharp thing huddled against the foot of the bed. \u201cI felt him die. But it\u2019s not better. It\u2019s not better.\u201d She shivers, but the set of her chin is stone. \u201cI dreamed of fire. I woke with blood in my mouth, I think I bit my tongue again, and -- and they\u2019re out there, my boys are out there -- I have to find them I </span>\n<em>\n<span>have to</span>\n</em>\n<span>.\u201d The hot spill of words. The ferocity of youth. Leia holds out her free hand. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Rey hesitates for a moment, then takes it. Her palm is work-roughened. Here is a girl who has never had a day of ease. Here is a child raised in hunger and pain and flight, here is a girl who has fought for each breath she has ever taken, here is a girl who has lived a lifetime of fear and pain -- and yet here is a girl with love in her eyes, and a heart big enough to hold the world. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>There\u2019s always a choice, Leia thinks. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cGo with her,\u201d she tells Luke. Luke\u2019s lips open, ready to voice his objections, but she squeezes his fingers with big-sister authority. \u201cYou </span>\n<em>\n<span>will</span>\n</em>\n<span> go with her, and you will...you will help them.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Luke kisses her forehead. Rey wavers, then presses her lips to Leia\u2019s cheek. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIf you see my son,\u201d she says. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>She doesn\u2019t finish that sentence. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>She doesn\u2019t know how to. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>--</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI still sense good in him,\u201d says Luke, like these words will bring comfort. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>In a galaxy far away, a long time ago, a woman panted those words as she died, blood sick and wet on her thighs. Leia shouldn\u2019t remember this, but she does -- she was never a normal child, not even fresh-turned out into the world, purple-slimed and howling. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cPhasma told me Hux had a sister,\u201d Leia replies. \u201cHe had a sister, and the sister had a husband who beat her, and she stayed with him because that\u2019s what you do in the First Order --you obey. And he found out, and he helped her escape him, even though the husband was from good old imperial stock, even though his father told him not to intervene. He was nineteen, and he held a gun to his sister\u2019s husband\u2019s head, and he said that if he ever laid a hand on her again he\u2019d shoot him.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Luke\u2019s staring at her with the intensity of a hermit. She wonders if he knows how much he looks like Ben Kenobi. She wonders if he cares. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cEveryone has good in them,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m old, Luke, and I\u2019ve seen the universe grow and shrink and rage and I have learned one thing above all: everyone is both bad and good, and the bad can do good and the good can do bad, and Ben does have good in him but -- but I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s enough.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>--</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>A conversation between a trooper and a pilot:</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cMy sister was born blind-deaf,\u201d says Pava.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI am sorry,\u201d says Fiver. \u201cAt least she would have a funeral. In the order, they would have burned her.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cShe\u2019s not dead.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI don\u2019t understand. She was -- is -- crippled. Why was she not humanely euthanized shortly after birth? She will live in darkness and suffering. She will never have a purpose. It is cruel to keep her alive.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cBitch! She\u2019s alive, and she works with the Resistance, and she has a droid to help her communicate --\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIt is </span>\n<em>\n<span>cruelty</span>\n</em>\n<span> to force her to endure!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>They glower at each other, both hot with fury, both utterly convinced they are in the right. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>--</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Here\u2019s the thing about good: it\u2019s </span>\n<em>\n<span>subjective.</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<span>--</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Finn knows this. He knows this, and he knows why troopers stay loyal, even if Poe doesn\u2019t -- he knows, and he understands, and h struggles to put it into words. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>If asked, he may say this: the worst thing that the First Order does to its troopers is make them want to be troopers. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>--</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>TY unit stayed loyal. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>TY unit stayed loyal, even though their officers did not, and they shot their commanders and shot their comrades , and Finn and Poe find themselves locked up in jail cells awaiting delivery to Ren.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhy did they do it?\u201d says Poe, left side of his face black-blue with bruising. His mouth split open like over-ripe fruit in the summer. \u201cWhy defend the people who enslaved them?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Finn hooks his fingers into the bars. His head jangles with numbers and names and </span>\n<em>\n<span>FN-2187 was a Stormtrooper </span>\n</em>\n<span>and he understands, he does, because the First Order is a mother, a cruel and hungry mother who rears strong young sons. Being a trooper is to be told you are nothing, and yet told you can attain if you serve -- and it is all too easy to neglect to notice that the one you are serving is the one that makes you nothing, because you blind yourself to that fact. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>You tell yourself: </span>\n<em>\n<span>I will please the system, the Order, I will rise, rise, rise. </span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>You tell yourself:</span>\n<em>\n<span> I am nothing because I am a trooper, but within the First Order I am something. </span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>You do not tell yourself: </span>\n<em>\n<span>I am nothing because the First Order made me nothing.</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>--</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Loyalty makes sense, in those circumstances. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>It\u2019s not loyalty to a cause. It\u2019s loyalty to a story</span>\n<em>\n<span>. I am a Stormtrooper, I will rise. I am a Stormtrooper, and without the Order I am nothing and within the order I have a chance.</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Shot-At-Dawn calls it cowardice. Two Sevens would call it the same thing that makes a clipped-winged bird huddle to the ground, unwilling to fly, even when its primaries grow back. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>--</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>There\u2019s good in everyone, and evil as well, but pettiness is a niche all to itself; and it\u2019s pettiness that makes TY-0989 yank Finn from Poe and hit him in the mouth at two o\u2019clock in the morning, standard time. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Sleep is shredded in moments. Finn lands against a wall, shoulders, spine, mouth -- all red and singing in pain -- and out of instinct he lashes out in return. His fist catches the trooper\u2019s cheek. Finn\u2019s travel-sore and battle-weary and TY-0989 is fresh and young and full of spite. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cFucking martyr,\u201d he spits. He\u2019s not wearing his helmet. He\u2019s only a little older than Rey and the colour of Jakku dust. \u201cI\u2019ll show you who\u2019s a fucking --\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Aboard the good ship </span>\n<em>\n<span>Commander, </span>\n</em>\n<span>where the blood of mutinous officers rusts along the walls and in the dorms, \u00a0alarms start to sing. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>--</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cTook you long enough,\u201d Poe pants. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Rey presses the pads of her fingers to his temples. \u201cWho did this to you?\u201d She tastes anger at the back of her throat, like bile or blood, and to swallow it down is to poison herself -- so she lets it spill out in hot-veined words. \u201cI\u2019ll kill them, I\u2019ll -- \u201c</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThey\u2019re already dead,\u201d says KU-0956, now known as Ceasefire. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou didn\u2019t let them surrender?\u201d </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThey killed their own,\u201d Ceasefire says, and that\u2019s it. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Finn understands. A Stormtrooper is raised to believe that loyalty is the foremost virtue. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>(Once, Hux bragged that a trooper has loyalty carved into their very bones.)</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>(He\u2019s right, of course.)</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>(The problem: loyalty, like hate, is merely a concept. Stormtroopers are loyal. Stormtroopers are unquestionably loyal. The question is: </span>\n<em>\n<span>who are they loyal to</span>\n</em>\n<span>.)</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>--</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cLet me tell you a story,\u201d says Hux. \u201cOnce upon a time, there was an Emperor and he wished to rule everything that has ever been, or ever will be --\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAnd he conjured fire, and it ate him up! I\u2019ve heard this one </span>\n<em>\n<span>before</span>\n</em>\n<span>,\u201d says Ren. He knows he is dreaming, and he detests that even in death Hux can still rile him. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>They stand on silver sands. The sky above is the thin white of dawn. There are two suns. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNo. No, I want to tell you a different story -- sit down,\u201d and in the infuriating manner of dreams, Kylo finds himself bidden to do so. Hux sits as well, cross-legged.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOnce upon a time, there was an Emperor and he wished to rule everything that has ever been, or ever will be. And he succeeded. And he lived a long and lonely life, and there was no end.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI do not understand.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI don\u2019t presume you do,\u201d says Hux. His face gentles. He reaches out with a gloved hand; Kylo skitters backwards. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou are </span>\n<em>\n<span>blind</span>\n</em>\n<span>. So very blind.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Syrupy blackness starts to run across the desert sands. Kylo springs to his feet; the darkness consumes the sun and the sky, until it is just he and Hux --</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>-- </span>\n<em>\n<span>only it is not Hux --</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cListen to me. You son of a bitch, listen to me, I\u2019m trying to help </span>\n<em>\n<span>listen to me --\u201d</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Kylo clamps his hands to his ears. \u201cI can\u2019t hear you! I can\u2019t hear you! I </span>\n<em>\n<span>can\u2019t </span>\n</em>\n<span>--\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>--</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>The Falcon sings through the stars, as it has done since the time of its birth, and aboard Luke plays Chewie at cards, losing roundly, \u00a0and Rey jerks awake from a dream. At once, Finn\u2019s hands are in her hair, soothing her, while Poe reaches for a glass of water. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI dreamed about sand,\u201d she says, \u201cwhy do I always dream about sand? I hate it. It\u2019s coarse and irritating and it gets </span>\n<em>\n<span>everywhere.\u201d</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cDunno. Why do I always dream about your dumb face rather than --\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Finn smacks him. Poe lapses into quiet. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI dreamed there was a man, and he was telling me a story,\u201d says Rey. She\u2019s staring into the murk of the ship like she can see her dream unveiling there, holoscreen-style. \u201cHe said. \u2018Once, in a galaxy very far away, and a long time ago, there was a man. He was married to a beautiful young woman. Now, where they lived there was a forest full of wolves, and the wife was prone to wander through them. He was plagued with dreams of the wolves eating up his wife, and he couldn\u2019t bear it, so he set the forest on fire, hoping to smoke the wolves out.\u2019\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>She takes a sip of water, leans against Finn. Her skin is glossed with sweat. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAnd he asked me how it would end. And I said, wasn\u2019t it obvious? The fire ate up the wolves, and because the wife was with them it ate up her as well, because you can\u2019t control the fires you start -- and if the man was stupid enough to set his home on fire because his wife was a tit then, well, he deserved it.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAnd,\u201d she continues, \u201che just got really quiet and he said I was right, and he said that I was a clever girl, and that I reminded him of someone he could have known. He asked me who my father was; he said that I did him credit. I said I had none; and I needed none; and that everything I was entirely my own choice. And, uh. I said he was being an arrogant prick. He </span>\n<em>\n<span>was</span>\n</em>\n<span>,\u201d Rey says to Poe\u2019s \u00a0open-mouthed grin. \u201cHe was, he was a patronising shit.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou should ask Master Luke,\u201d says Finn. \u201cSounds like his sort of thing.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYeah. Force, help me.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>--</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWe will proceed with the liberation of Persephone,\u201d says Leia. \u201cWe promised aid, and it will be delivered,\u201d and none question her, and none suggest that she take time to mourn, and she is winter, she is fury, she is the unstoppable drift of tectonic plates. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>She is a mother. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>(</span>\n<em>\n<span>A woman who had more children than she ever knew --)</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>(Poe. Pava. Snap. Sunny. Dancer -- </span>\n<em>\n<span>her pilots hers --</span>\n</em>\n<span>)</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>(Once, Han had asked her: </span>\n<em>\n<span>What would you do if I died in action?</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>She had replied: </span>\n<em>\n<span>bury you.</span>\n</em>\n<span>)</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>--</span>\n</p>\n<p><br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI </span>\n<em>\n<span>cannot,\u201d </span>\n</em>\n<span>says Phasma. \u201cI cannot take up command again -- they will not accept me --\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThey will, and they have, and this is an </span>\n<em>\n<span>order</span>\n</em>\n<span>.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cTo be a captain again --\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI was thinking Major.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Phasma bows her head. \u201cMay I speak plainly, ma\u2019am?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThat you may.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cEven if we do not win...even if I die in battle, which I certainly expect to, I am glad that I could have fought for the Resistance. Under you. I am glad that...that I will have a funeral. Ma\u2019am.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Phasma\u2019s hair is too long, or too short, depending on how you look at it. Not a buzzcut anymore; it is feathery, falling down towards her collar. There\u2019s a wisp snagged on her nose. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Leia reaches up -- and up -- and brushes it aside. Her mouth pulls tight. \u201cI know,\u201d she says. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>--</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhat did he look like, this man you dreamed of?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cShaggy hair. Strange eyes -- sort of yellow. A scar on his cheek. Metal hand. He seemed...familiar, somehow. Are you okay?\u201d for her teacher has gone white. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI am...I must meditate on this.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cStupid, cryptic Jedi,\u201d Rey, the littlest Jedi, mutters. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>--</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cCaptain, I have a question -- </span>\n<em>\n<span>sir</span>\n</em>\n<span>.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNo need to be quite so formal, Break-Door-Down,\u201d says Captain Bren, corner of his mouth tugged up in sly amusement. Break-Door-Down has succumbed to pressure and permitted the shortening of his title, the removal of </span>\n<em>\n<span>the</span>\n</em>\n<span> (but who will </span>\n<em>\n<span>not</span>\n</em>\n<span> answer to Door, Break, or </span>\n<em>\n<span>Get Down</span>\n</em>\n<span> or any of the other absurd names that they try and foist upon him).</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYessir,\u201d says Break-Door-Down, because old habits die hard. \u201cCan I --\u201d and halfway through the request he remembers he doesn\u2019t need permission to sit, and so he slumps hard onto the workbench. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Opposite him, Shot-At-Dawn pauses in the cleaning of her gun. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>(Her name is now even more apt. Once a he, now a she, and the First Order decommissions what it perceives as deviation.) </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHave I made an error? I thought your name was Captain Bren.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIt is.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI heard Pava refer to you as </span>\n<em>\n<span>Archer</span>\n</em>\n<span>.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThat\u2019s my surname.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhy do you have two names? Is it a mark of rank?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNope. Everyone has them -- well. Humans do. It demarcates family lineage. So, I am Archer because my mother was Archer and so was my father --\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYour parents were siblings?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNo! I\u2019m not from fucking </span>\n<em>\n<span>Jakku</span>\n</em>\n<span>. No, my mother is an Archer -- Callimina Archer -- and my father was an I\u2019mak, and as she had the higher rank he took her surname. It\u2019s how it worked on my old home planet. Some places function differently, but that\u2019s the basic principle. My sisters have that surname as well.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cCan I have a surname?\u201d Shot-At-Dawn says. Break-Door-Down\u2019s lips shape the word </span>\n<em>\n<span>Archer</span>\n</em>\n<span> and </span>\n<em>\n<span>Callimina </span>\n</em>\n<span>and he has gone very, very pale. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cJust pick one.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIt\u2019s a mark of family, right?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cGenerally, yes.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThen I\u2019m Archer. So\u2019s Break-Door-Down. My unit is my family.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>She says it with calm authority. Bren Archer\u2019s face lights up with joy. \u201cThat\u2019s...that\u2019s lovely.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhen we liberate your family,\u201d continues Shot-At-Dawn, \u201cyour sisters may serve with us, and they will be Archers too.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cMy sisters are not the serving sort,\u201d says Archer, but he\u2019s smiling at the thought.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Break-Door-Down remembers: a commslink, </span>\n<em>\n<span>FN-2187 was not a Stormtrooper -- Thalia Five -- I know you have kids in there --</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>He remembers, and says not a word. There\u2019s always a choice; and sometimes it is better for the past to remain the past.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>--</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201c</span>\n<em>\n<span>What</span>\n</em>\n<span> did you say your surname was?\u201d says Pava. Fiver smiles, wide and joyful. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHoldhands. Same as the rest of my unit. We could never do </span>\n<em>\n<span>this</span>\n</em>\n<span> in the Order,\u201d and she holds up their entwined fingers and all Pava can do is thank every deity she knows that Fiver did not choose the </span>\n<em>\n<span>other</span>\n</em>\n<span> activity she has learned to love after defecting. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>--</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cTraitor is a </span>\n<em>\n<span>bad</span>\n</em>\n<span> thing,\u201d beeps R2-D2. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIt\u2019s what the Order calls Finn,\u201d says Two Sevens Traitor, flinty-eyed and daring the droid to disagree. \u201cI\u2019m proud to claim it for myself.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>--</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Persephone calls. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The freshly surnamed troopers -- for once one decided upon a name, the others started to adopt their own, and soon the poor overworked droids have twice as many bizarre titles to note down -- are given a choice. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>(There is </span>\n<em>\n<span>always</span>\n</em>\n<span> a choice, Phasma told them, one and all. Always, always, always.)</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>(You do not have to fight. You do not have to fly to Persephone and land on the once-lush grasslands and tear into those you once called brothers and sisters, you do not have to.)</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>They remember Ithaka. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>All who can go, do so. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>--</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>The message the First Order intended: this is what happens if you fight for the Resistance. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The message they delivered: we will kill you if you fight or not. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The message they delivered: you might as well fight. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>--</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cMercy is weakness,\u201d says Emperor Ren. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cBut sir -- Thalia Five has surrendered -- they have laid down their arms --\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cBurn it to the ground.

He dreams of General Hux, gibbering and hunched over, carving names into his arms until bone shows slick and white through the red ruin of his flesh. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cSixty billion in the Hosnian system,\u201d he says, staring up with empty sockets (there are names on his face, curling inwards, spiralling towards his eyes, names on his lids, on his lips, on the inside of his tongue --) \u201cSixty billion and I cannot remember their names, I cannot, I cannot. I can\u2019t remember, I have to, I can\u2019t remember and I have to --\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cDo you remember the names of the Jedi children?\u201d a voice singsongs into his ear. \u201cDo you remember, do you? Have you heard that the Resistance has taken the entire fleet from the skies around Janus II? They surrendered. Mercy can be wisdom, it can be, sometimes. When you\u2019re fighting a war --\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Kylo Ren spins around, shoves at the figure behind him. The man laughs, low and cold and curdled. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201c--when you\u2019re fighting a war,\u201d says Kylo. \u201cYou kill your enemies.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cEnemies.

Mourn later!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>She thinks of General Organa, shoulders straight despite the weight of losing a husband, a son, a planet, a home -- and she bites back her tears. \u201cTo me!\u201d she shouts, and lunges forwards.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>--</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI need to tell you something.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNot the time, Door!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cBut sir -- \u201c</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cDoor Archer, you son of a bitch, you follow orders.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIt was me!

Now bring me the scalps of any First Order bastards you find! First Order bastards,\u201d he adds, \u201cwho aren\u2019t me!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>--</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI\u2019m frightened.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIt\u2019s okay. We all are. Deep breaths, okay?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Osma holds Reyma\u2019s hands, tight as can be. Reyma, the girl who shot her rapist and named herself after two Resistance heroes, clutches back. It\u2019s her first proper battle, and she\u2019s ashen under a mask of blood. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>(It\u2019s not hers.)</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d says Osma, who still refers to Bren as </span>\n<em>\n<span>Poe</span>\n</em>\n<span>, despite his virulent protests. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cReyma. Reyma Kiltjael.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>(Kiltjael. Spelling is not a strong suit for Reyma.

Her children will know where their freedom came from.)</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAnd who are you?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI was a Stormtrooper. I was. And now I\u2019m </span>\n<em>\n<span>me</span>\n</em>\n<span>.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>--</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>And in the sky, Poe coughs out hard, tearless sobs. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cPava\u2019s gone,\u201d he says. \u00a0\u201cPava\u2019s gone, she\u2019s down, she\u2019s </span>\n<em>\n<span>gone</span>\n</em>\n<span>.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>He thinks of General Organa, iron-eyed and winter-hard and swallows thickly. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cBlack Squadron, prepare to engage.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>--</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Finn and Rey are two minutes from deploying \u00a0when Rey collapses: her legs shudder to the side, her eyes roll back, and blood froths between her lips. She\u2019s bitten through her tongue.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cRey! REY!\u201d and Finn grabs her, pulls her away from the gathered ranks of Resistance fighters -- some are wearing full Stormtrooper uniform, others bits and pieces of it, and the overall effect is that one cannot tell the difference between former trooper and Resistance veteran, between refugee and bounty hunter gone good. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cGo on without me.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Major Phasma gives him a quick, curt nod. \u201cIf we survive this,\u201d she says, \u201cI will have them make you an officer. I always said you had the material for it. Fall </span>\n<em>\n<span>out</span>\n</em>\n<span>.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>--</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Finn carries her towards the Med-Bay. They\u2019re using an old First Order ship -- most of the Resistance is using old First Order gear nowadays -- and he finds that he knows exactly where to go without stopping to consult a holomap. He\u2019s got these corridors carved into his programming, after all --</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Rey stirs in his arms. Her eyes sneak open. \u201cThey gone?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYes -- yes, Rey are you okay?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cPut me down.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Finn lowers her with exceeding gentleness. Her legs snap straight. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI had a vision,\u201d she says, without preamble. \u201cHe\u2019s got Poe.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>--</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>In the command centre, Luke bleaches white. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNo. </span>\n<em>\n<span>No </span>\n</em>\n<span>Rey, what are you doing -- can\u2019t you see? --\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>By the time he\u2019s got to the hangar, it\u2019s too late. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>--</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>They\u2019re gone. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>--</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Kylo\u2019s flagship is called </span>\n<em>\n<span>the Executor </span>\n</em>\n<span>because of course it is. Rey\u2019s eyes are shuttered tight, focusing on the thin silver thread of </span>\n<em>\n<span>Poe </span>\n</em>\n<span>that sings to her, distress and pain tangling up, discordant and hideous. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI\u2019m coming for you,\u201d she promises. \u201cI am, I am.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>--</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Ren is waiting for them. His cape is a tattered black shiver, and his helmet is battered, and his lightsabre sings crackling death, and there is no sign of Poe. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>With a flicker of fingers, he sends Finn flying backwards. The trooper smacks against the white wall with a wet, organic crunch and does not move. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHave you heard?\u201d says Kylo, almost conversationally, clenching his fist. \u201cI\u2019m stronger than Snoke. I\u2019m stronger than any Jedi there ever was.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Rey cannot breathe. Her legs thrash; her face purples. She reaches out to the Force, the way Master Luke has shown her, and </span>\n<em>\n<span>yanks </span>\n</em>\n<span>-- and his grasp on her slackens, and she smacks into the ground.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Her own lightsabre blossoms green as spring. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI could teach you,\u201d he says. \u201cI could --\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI would rather </span>\n<em>\n<span>die </span>\n</em>\n<span>than be like you -- you </span>\n<em>\n<span>traitor </span>\n</em>\n<span>you </span>\n<em>\n<span>coward</span>\n</em>\n<span> --\u201d she screams, and he shrugs, languid. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cVery well.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>He doesn\u2019t clench his fist. He doesn\u2019t swing his sabre. He snaps his fingers. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The wall rips open, metal screaming, and a girder slashes across Rey\u2019s throat. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Finn\u2019s extremities go cold. He cannot breathe. He cannot think. There is so much blood, and it\u2019s all pouring from her -- how can a girl so little have so much blood in her?</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI did ask,\u201d Kylo says, a petulant twinge in his voice and he steps forward and Finn hunches over Rey, one hand in her throat, trying desperately to hold the artery closed -- the way his trooper training told him how -- \u00a0and Kylo never makes contact, because Luke has arrived, and it is a fight that songs will be written about -- Kylo Ren, defeated by Luke Skywalker, forced to flee his own ship -- but Finn does not notice one bit of it, not one bit, because Rey is bleeding in his arms, Rey is dying slow and red, and nothing else matters, nothing else at all. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>--</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>A long time ago, in a galaxy far away, there was a girl. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>She was beautiful and clever and strong, with a bodyweight that was at least ninety per cent heart. She was not a princess. She was not a general. She did not have a kingdom or an army, but she had friends she loved and a life she lived, and her heart was her downfall -- for a girl with a heart that was at least ninety per cent of her bodyweight is doomed, perhaps, from the first time she draws breath. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Because this is a girl who has lived a life of pain and struggle, and emerged with her eyes shining hope. Because this is a girl who shines with hope, and this is a girl with the boy she loves at her side. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>She set no fires. She came to save her prince, the </span>\n<em>\n<span>other</span>\n</em>\n<span> boy she loves, and she died. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>--</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Except, of course, the stories almost always leave out the truth of the matter: there is no end. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>--</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>In the Falcon, Luke cuts into Rey with scalpels designed to operate on machinery. Chewie moans advice in the background, and Luke remembers Tattoine, the Sand People, and how they could salvage a body that would not die. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHold on,\u201d he says. \u201cHold on,\u201d and he thanks every god that there has ever been that he knows electronics, that he knows how flesh and metal meld together and make life. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>A bit of piping. A lot of prayer. Finn, bruised and shaking and very much alive. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Below, victory songs are sung. Persephone falls to the Resistance, and above Rey breathes -- Rey </span>\n<em>\n<span>breathes</span>\n</em>\n<span>.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>--</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>At least. She tries to. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>--</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>There\u2019s a low, metallic wheeze shuddering through the corridors. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhat is wrong with the engines?\u201d Ren asks of a nearby officer. She checks her datapad.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThat\u2019s not the engine,\u201d she says, \u201cit seems to be the, uh. The holoboard sound.\u201d She frowns over a map of the ships electronics. \u201cWhy\u2019s it turning on? It\u2019s -- oh fuck. It\u2019s being hijacked, it\u2019s an external signal --\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Ren tears the pad from her hand, flicks his wrist; she sails down the hallway, landing bruised and shuddering and alive. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The wheezing continues. It\u2019s a strange sound, a little like metal grating on metal, a little like the shuddering breath of a great animal -- and as he listens it clarifies, and sounds (somehow) </span>\n<em>\n<span>wet</span>\n</em>\n<span>. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>His fingers skitter over the map. Every holoboard in the ship is activating. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The sound coalesces. It is breathing. It is the pull of air into lungs and out again, and it is distorted, heavy and mechanical and it is --</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<span>No --</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The screens flicker on. A girl stares out from them.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cKylo Ren,\u201d she says, vibrato and metallic, blood-gargled and barely audible. Her throat -- her split-open throat -- has been clumsily stitched shut around a mechanical instrument, the sort of thing Sand People use on those warriors who have suffered injuries to the throat. Primitive, clunky but </span>\n<em>\n<span>functional </span>\n</em>\n<span>-- it is keeping her alive. It is distorting her voice. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>After the effort of speaking his name, she breathes in. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>It is a hard, metallic wheeze. It echoes. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>No. </span>\n<em>\n<span>No</span>\n</em>\n<span>. He remembers the tales. Grandfather\u2019s breath, hard and looming, </span>\n<em>\n<span>Grandfather</span>\n</em>\n<span> --</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cMy name is Rey,\u201d she says, \u201cand I am a Jedi Knight.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>She heaves in another breath. Talking pains her, but her eyes are sharp and clear, even as blood starts to trail from the corner of her mouth. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>She heaves in another breath, and the ship rings with the metal shudder of -- like -- </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<span>Don\u2019t think it! Don\u2019t even think it!</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOnce there was a girl,\u201d she says. There\u2019s blood on her mouth. There\u2019s fire in her eyes. Her voice is rasping, shuddering, metal-organic. \u201cAnd she </span>\n<em>\n<span>lived</span>\n</em>\n<span>.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p><br>\n<br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>They shoot JA-8757 for the crime of sedition.</p>\n<p>At least, they try to.</p>\n<p>\u201cTake off your helmet!\u201d barks Colonel Stabilo, and the trooper does so. \u201cTake aim!\u201d Her squad levels their blasters, angle them at JA-8757\u2019s sweat-glossed face. \u201cFire!\u201d</p>\n<p>They do.</p>\n<p>\u201cKnew you wouldn\u2019t have the balls,\u201d says JA-8757 to her captain, one JJ-8752.</p>\n<p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t kill you, you little shit,\u201d he says, all rough affection, then turns to his squad. \u201cCome on! Let\u2019s get the rest of the bastards!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>JA-8757\u2019s crime: saying, within earshot of another trooper, the words <em> I think Persephone is a lost cause </em>.</p>\n<p>Colonel Stabilo\u2019s mistake: forgetting that power is contingent on people believing you have it. She thought that because she was a colonel, because her family had been High Command since the days of the Empire, she carried their authority about like an heirloom.</p>\n<p>That\u2019s not how it works. Not anymore.</p>\n<p>Legacy means nothing. All that matters is who you are right in that moment, when you\u2019ve got a blaster in your hands and a choice at your feet.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Every child in the Republic is taught this: wars have rules.</p>\n<p>Every child in the First Order is taught this: wars have rules.</p>\n<p>The problem: the rules differ <em> drastically</em>.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cCan I have a cigarette?\u201d quips Commander Vesper, hawkish arrogance parcelled in First Order black.</p>\n<p>There are rules. Even when surrendering, a man has a little dignity. Even here, on Persephone, on the day the First Order has its back broken -- even then.</p>\n<p>He knows this.</p>\n<p>Cass, once Stormtrooper CH-0023, apparently does not.</p>\n<p>He hits Vesper across the mouth.</p>\n<p>\u201cI surrendered!\u201d spits Vesper, eyes wide, blood trickling from his split lip.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat was it that we\u2019re told in basic training?\u201d asks Cass, drawing his riot baton, letting it extend.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo trooper surrenders. It\u2019s better to die,\u201d says Jezzika, once CH-0742.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd what did the First Order <em> do </em> to those troopers who came back from captivity? Who clawed their way home?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cExecuted them for permitting themselves to be captured,\u201d drawls Stumps, once SH-8422.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh yes. That\u2019s what we were taught.\u201d</p>\n<p>Cass tips the Commander\u2019s chin up with the end of the baton.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t I show you how well we learned the lesson?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s odd.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThey were waving a white flag. Why were they doing that?\u201d</p>\n<p>Two Sevens tugs the length of fabric loose from the officer\u2019s bloodied fists.</p>\n<p>\u201cStrange First Order thing, probably,\u201d he says.</p>\n<p>Beside him, a Resistance fighter whines. \u201cHe looks so young,\u201d she says.</p>\n<p>\u201cSeventeen rotations, I\u2019d say,\u201d says Two Sevens, absently. \u201cWhy the white?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh God,\u201d she says, \u201coh God,\u201d and she is pale and sweating and fever-rank and Two Sevens does not know what is wrong. \u201cThey were surrendering, they were children --\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo they weren\u2019t,\u201d says Two Sevens. Battle-sickness, he assumes. It gets to everyone. He nudges a reassuring palm against her shoulder.</p>\n<p>(Some troopers have learned how to touch, how to hug, how to use their bodies for things that are not warfare..Some haven\u2019t.)</p>\n<p>(Two Sevens decidedly hasn\u2019t.)</p>\n<p>\u201cThey didn\u2019t tell you,\u201d says his squadmate, \u201cwhat a white flag means, did they?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>A story that Vesper once told his daughter, as she perched on his knee:</p>\n<p>\u201cThere was once a beautiful princess, and her land was stricken by a terrible monster --\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDid it look like a rathar?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em> Yes </em>. And the princess -- why, she looked a little like you.\u201d</p>\n<p>The child tittered.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd she was so scared of this monster, but a friendly fire spirit asked if it could help -- and she agreed! -- so it burned up the monster, tentacles and eyes and all. And the friendly fire spirit went away, its purpose served.\u201d</p>\n<p>That\u2019s not the ending Vesper\u2019s father told him, but his little Amelia is far too young to face such cruel stories.</p>\n<p>(When he was her age, CH-0023 fell asleep to the soft murmur of his comrades, reciting the words of Hux\u2019s speeches.)</p>\n<p>(<em> Please </em> , Vesper tries to say. <em> I don\u2019t want my daughter to grow up without a father </em>.)</p>\n<p>(The baton comes down again. And again. And again.)</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou okay, Reyma?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI was so s<em> cared </em>,\u201d says the girl. Her knees are hunched to her chest. Cass loops an arm around her shoulders, tugs her into a half-hug.</p>\n<p>(Cass <em> does </em>understand the need for touch.)</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s a scary thing,\u201d he says. \u201cBut you fought anyway, and that\u2019s okay. They tell us that fear is weakness, but it isn\u2019t -- it is utterly, utterly human.\u201d</p>\n<p>They sit there in silence for a moment. Around them, Persephone recovers.</p>\n<p>Finally, Cass says, \u201cShall I tell you a story?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGo on then.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThere was once a boy called FN-2187,\u201d starts Cass, \u201cand he was a Stormtrooper\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>There\u2019s blood on his hands. It dries in the sun.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Finn snaps, \u201cyou <em> cannot </em>just kill them.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThey are First Order monsters,\u201d says the Stormtrooper. His name is Finnoehan. Even Finn thinks that name is a little much.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe promised a fair trial and we will <em> deliver </em>a fair trial.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou...you mean to keep your promise to them?\u201d</p>\n<p>Finnoehan gestures behind him. There are perhaps fifteen officers there, chained in durasteel, stripped of any indicator of rank and, in a couple of cases, just stripped entirely. All are bruised and split-lipped. All look very cold, and very scared.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe also do not beat prisoners.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe don\u2019t? Huh.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd give them some clothes!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy? They would not have given us the same choice.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBecause we\u2019re not like them. Because at some point we\u2019ve got to draw a line and not cross it. Because we don\u2019t want to build a new world on the blood of the old.\u201d Finn\u2019s exhausted. His head is a hard, ugly throb and the smell of Rey\u2019s blood is still snagged in his nose. \u201cBecause we were Stormtroopers, and we\u2019re not the monsters they wanted us to be.\u201d</p>\n<p>Finnoehan nods, slowly. He\u2019s the newly elected captain of the ship <em> Breakwing </em>, which had been sent to Persephone to assist the struggling loyalists. Instead, the troopers had risen up and slaughtered the majority of their officers.</p>\n<p>(Elected. Isn\u2019t that a funny thing? The troopers had sat down, talked, and voted on a leader. They had chosen. The thought is enough to warm Finn\u2019s aching, aching heart.)</p>\n<p>\u201cI will deliver them for trial,\u201d he says, eventually. \u201cBecause we were Stormtroopers, and we are not anymore.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBecause you\u2019re Finnoehan.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve been thinking about changing it, actually. Everyone\u2019s named after Resistance heroes.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cChange it to whatever you want. You get to choose.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve always liked that bit of day, when the sun\u2019s just going down.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDusk?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s the one. That\u2019s me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Captain Dusk salutes, and the commslink fades out.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Captain Dusk, of course, passes the message along.</p>\n<p>\u201cFinn said what?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYup. No shooting of prisoners.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cReally? Fuck.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>They throw Colonel Stablio\u2019s corpse out of the airlock, along with the rest of the officers.</p>\n<p>The lucky ones are already dead.</p>\n<p>One of them is spared. Only one. Her name is Sekhmet, and the rest of the officers thought her soft and useless, and this is why she lives --</p>\n<p>\u201c<em> I\u2019m sorry Jate, I really am </em>,\u201d and it\u2019s JJ-8757\u2019s nickname and none of the officers knew it, but this one, this small and scared thing, she did and so she hauls the girl away from the grasping hands of her comrades.</p>\n<p>\u201cTouch her, and I\u2019ll fucking kill you,\u201d she says.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The question: what now?</p>\n<p>\u201cWe should go to the Resistance,\u201d says Jate. \u201cThey\u2019re the ones fighting for us.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI want to go to the Outer Rim,\u201d her captain, Jayjay, says. \u201cI don\u2019t want any part in this war.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI say the Resistance,\u201d says Yanda.</p>\n<p>\u201cI say the Outer Rim,\u201d says Eighty Nine, who has not quite grasped the concept of <em> naming </em>.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The solution:</p>\n<p>\u201cHands up who wants to go to the Resistance. Hands up for the Outer Rim.\u201d</p>\n<p>A count.</p>\n<p>\u201cResistance, it is.\u201d</p>\n<p>Surly mutterings. \u201cIf you don\u2019t like it,\u201d says Jate, \u201cthen go away.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWho put you in charge?\u201d says Jayjay. He\u2019s smart enough to not claim command by virtue of his once-held rank. The atmosphere is electric, and trying to use old power structures to secure his wishes will probably result in him being thrown out the airlock as well.</p>\n<p>\u201cHands up for me,\u201d says Jate, suddenly. \u201cRight. And hands up for Jayjay.\u201d</p>\n<p>She wins by fifty-three votes.</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t like it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNext time, promise something better. Now do as you\u2019re told!\u201d</p>\n<p>That\u2019s democracy.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHow is she?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cComing out of surgery soon,\u201d Poe says. Poe who has never been aboard the <em> Executor, </em>Poe who was never in Kylo Ren\u2019s hands, Poe who is still wracked with guilt over the fact that Rey\u2019s throat was split open because of him, split to the spine.</p>\n<p>BB-8 beeps sadly. Poe rubs his hand along the droids shell. \u201cHow\u2019s being patron saint of the revolution going?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShit,\u201d Finn says, with feeling. \u201cI just had to explain why we don\u2019t shoot prisoners. <em> Again </em> . Captain Dusk...he\u2019s a good person, they\u2019re all good people, but they\u2019ve been taught that...that war is one thing, and it\u2019s not, it\u2019s another, and they\u2019re on our side and <em> good </em> but they don\u2019t understand. And bad is just caught up in the good, and I can\u2019t unpick the two and I want Rey and I want you and I want to sleep for a thousand years.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFinn,\u201d says Poe. \u201cOh baby,\u201d and he pulls Finn against him, presses a kiss to the corner of his mouth. \u201cIt\u2019s okay. It\u2019ll be okay, we --\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t see her. I had my hands in her throat, there was blood everywhere, and her head was <em> dangling </em> and if -- if there had been just a moment more, a bit more, then she would have --\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut she didn\u2019t. And she\u2019s alive --\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c--but --\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShe\u2019s not dead. She\u2019s <em> not </em>. And she\u2019ll be okay, and we\u2019ll win, we will.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know that. You don\u2019t.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes I do. Because once there was a Stormtrooper, and his name was FN-2186, and he was raised to kill, to fight. He was told, every day of his life, that killing people was good, that the First Order was everything -- and do you know what he did? He rebelled. And if he can do that, then anyone can.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou can\u2019t just <em> shoot </em>them,\u201d Jayjay is saying, but Jate doesn\u2019t hear him, doesn\u2019t hear anything but the buzz of blood in her ears.</p>\n<p>Sekhmet is bleeding.</p>\n<p>Sekhmet is bleeding from places where <em> no one should ever bleed </em> and the culprits are there -- are <em> right there </em> -- hands up, tentative, like they don\u2019t know what they did wrong.</p>\n<p>\u201cShe\u2019s an officer,\u201d says one of them, Tallymark. His gaze flickers to Jayjay, like an appeal to rationality. \u201cShe\u2019s an officer, she\u2019s one of them -- does it matter what we do to her?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course it doesn\u2019t,\u201d chimes in his squadmate, Flies-Better. Her lips curl. \u201cShe\u2019s one of them. They burned the Hosnian system, they treated us like slaves --\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd so you -- you --\u201d Words catch in her throat. Jayjay is in the way, she can\u2019t kill them without maybe hitting him, and so she lets the blaster hang slack by her side. \u201cRevenge makes nothing better! Acting like animals helps fucking no one! What,\u201d and she stops, scrounging for something beyond <em> I\u2019ll kill you I\u2019ll kill you. </em> \u201cHave you heard,\u201d she says, instead, \u201cthat Finn lets officers live? That he doesn\u2019t allow torture, that he -- that he told Captain Dusk, of <em> Breakwing </em>, to bring them in for trial.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThen we\u2019ll put her on trial,\u201d sneers Tallymark.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat are we?\u201d she says, ignoring him, turning to the assembled troopers. \u201cWhat are we? The First Order says that rebels are all rapist, murdering bastards. Are they right? Are we proving them right? Or are we people, actual people, with names and lives and fucking <em> compassion </em>. We\u2019ve got a second chance. What do we want our new world to look like?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Martial law applies.</p>\n<p>Tallymark and Flies-Better are shot.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Jate says. \u201cI promise you that no one will ever do that to you again.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sekhmet\u2019s family died when Thalia Five burned. She has no one.</p>\n<p>She takes Jate\u2019s hand.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The junior officers emerge blinking, shaking into the light. The eldest, Two Sevens thinks, looks all of sixteen rotations old.</p>\n<p>\u201cNot so arrogant now, are they?\u201d Cass crows.</p>\n<p>Two squadrons, linked up and flushing out any survivors. This particular cavern system was one of the last to be checked.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe surrender,\u201d says a girl, dark-skinned and black-eyed and still wearing her insignia. \u201cI --\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe don\u2019t take officers as prisoners,\u201d Cass says, levelling his blaster.</p>\n<p>Two Sevens steps in front of him. \u201cWe take whoever surrenders.\u201d</p>\n<p>Cass isn\u2019t angry; he\u2019s genuinely confused. Head quirked on one side, brows pulling down, lips curling around, \u201cWhy?\u201d because no one has ever explained it to him.</p>\n<p>Two Sevens isn\u2019t entirely sure how to put it into words. He\u2019s thinking of blood-soaked white flags, broken bodies in the mud, miners crumpling under his blaster.</p>\n<p>\u201cBecause,\u201d he says, \u201cbecause we\u2019re better than they say we are.\u201d</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a clump of hair on Cass\u2019s riot baton. It flutters in the wind, adhered by something red and tacky, and Two Sevens doesn\u2019t comment on it.</p>\n<p>\u201cBecause,\u201d he continues, \u201cFinn would want us to realise that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cTell me something,\u201d says a man Kylo Ren does not recognise, \u201cdo you remember the names of the Jedi children?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo. To remember them is weakness.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDid Snoke say that, or did you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDoes it matter?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo. It doesn\u2019t. Everything you are is your own choice. You know, they once called me the Chosen One.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t care. I don\u2019t <em> care </em> --\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMy Lord?\u201d says Commander Tyra. \u201cMy Lord?\u201d</p>\n<p>Ren jerks awake. \u201cYes?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe can retreat to the Outer Rims,\u201d she says -- or is saying -- or has been saying.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou need to remember, Kylo. Remember.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m awake,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m not dreaming. You\u2019re not <em> real </em> --\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMy Lord --\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d says the man. His smile is <em> sad </em>. \u201cNo you\u2019re not.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The General has new headquarters. Once the First Order flagship <em> Tyrant </em> , now <em> Solo </em>, it loops in slow orbit around Persephone -- the planet on which the First Order\u2019s spine was snapped -- and in the medbay Rey sleeps, recovering from her surgery, and in the brig scared First Order loyalists await trial, and in the command centre Leia, Luke, Finn, Poe and Chewie sit in a circle around a great silver hologram of the planet below.</p>\n<p>\u201cI feel him,\u201d Leia says, \u201cunder my heart, I feel him. He\u2019s...he\u2019s so afraid, he\u2019s lunging from one engagement to the next, he\u2019s running. He killed Snoke, he thought that he was ready and he <em> isn\u2019t </em> . He\u2019s just <em> scared </em>. He thought that he could bring the Dark Side to victory but he forgot, or he never knew, that the Dark Side eats up its own.\u201d</p>\n<p>Luke puts his hand on her shoulder. \u201cThere\u2019s the Light in him,\u201d he says.</p>\n<p>Poe\u2019s lip curls. \u201cI don\u2019t care. I really don\u2019t care.\u201d BB-8 beeps at him.</p>\n<p>\n<em> Don\u2019t interrupt the General -- </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll say what I like,\u201d snaps Poe. \u201cI don\u2019t care about him. I don\u2019t care about the Force, or the prophecy, or Chosen Ones or,\u201d he bites back the words <em> Skywalker family drama </em>but he can tell from Luke\u2019s face that they\u2019ve been heard. \u201cI...I --\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI know,\u201d says Leia. \u201cHe\u2019s caused such pain, but he is my son, and I still feel his fear.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah.\u201d says Poe, hot and burning around his nape, shaking with -- with something. It\u2019s all too much. Pava is dead. Dancer is dead. All of Green Squadron is gone. Rey\u2019s clinging to life by a thread. And now -- \u201cYeah, he\u2019s your kid, yeah,\u201d and he turns and walks off, needing movement, needing <em> something </em>.</p>\n<p>\u201cI should go after him,\u201d mutters Finn, and dashes off.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a ghost aboard <em> Solo </em>.</p>\n<p>\u201cOnce there was a man,\u201d he says, \u201cand he failed his children. Don\u2019t you take after me, Leia, don\u2019t you dare.\u201d</p>\n<p>The Force is a hungry, merciless thing. It plucks at her bones, whispering <em> listen listen listen </em>and Leia cannot pretend that she can\u2019t hear it anymore. She lifts her head, stares at her father\u2019s apparition. He\u2019s young, so very young, long-haired, a scar crooked over his cheek.</p>\n<p>\u201cHan, I need you,\u201d she whispers, tears running hot and silver down her face. \u201cOh Han, why did you leave me?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOnce there was a man,\u201d says Anakin Skywalker, \u201cand he was so afraid for his family he set a fire that ate up everything he had ever loved.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI know that story. I know it and I wish I didn\u2019t.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLet me tell you another one then, daughter. Once there was a woman, and she saved her children, even though it burned her alive.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The secret: the strongest woman in the world breaks sometimes.</p>\n<p>The truth: strength is not in never breaking; it is gathering the pieces and standing once more.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cPoe?\u201d</p>\n<p>She finds him by Rey\u2019s bedside, his head bowed, his shoulders a low arc. BB-8 is between his knees, softly beeping --</p>\n<p>\n<em> Wake up Rey, wake up Friend Rey. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u201cHello ma\u2019am,\u201d he says, pepper-quick grin on his face, but there\u2019s something lost about it, like he\u2019s copying something he once knew how to do. \u201cShe made it through the surgery, at least.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShe\u2019s remarkable. She\u2019s --\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIf you say, she\u2019s strong with the Force I\u2019ll fucking scream, I swear. I wish she wasn\u2019t a Jedi. I wish she was just Rey. She wakes screaming every night, she wakes -- she <em> woke </em>-- with blood on her tongue and this scream, this awful --\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI was going to say that she reminds me of you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh. Well. Everything I am I learned off you.\u201d He flashes another smile, this one a shade brighter.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo. Everything you are you chose.\u201d She sits down next to him. \u201cBut I\u2019ll say this -- you have a damn good role model.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThanks, General.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCall me Leia.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWe need to head back to Persephone.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMy Lord -- there is nothing there for us,\u201d General Asric says. She reeks of fear. \u201cWe must flee to the Outer Rims, we must --\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShe\u2019s right,\u201d says the man, wavering in and out of existence like a bad holoscreen connection. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing there for the Order. But what is there for you, Kylo? What is there for you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe can set a trap,\u201d says Kylo Ren. \u201cI\u2019ll go alone, and tell my mother I have seen the error of my ways. And then, when the time is right --\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLet me tell you a story,\u201d says the man, \u201cabout an Emperor who got everything he ever thought he wanted. There was no end.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Three days after the final battle of Persephone, they hold a funeral on the planet\u2019s largest continent.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe remember the fallen,\u201d says General Organa, \u201cthose who gave their lives so that we may build a better world, a brighter world.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe remember those who fought so bravely,\u201d says Phasma, \u201cand we aspire to be worthy of their sacrifice.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThey are at rest with the Force,\u201d says Luke, \u201cand they will know peace.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThey were magnificent pilots,\u201d says Poe, \u201cand good friends.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThey were so very brave,\u201d says Rey, \u201cwe remember them,\u201d and her voice is not as metallic as before, but there is a hard and shuddering whirr to it. She wears a black headscarf around her throat, over her head, designed to shield the machinery that has patched her together.</p>\n<p>(Her breath snags, catches, buzzes.)</p>\n<p>(You can tell she is approaching.)</p>\n<p>\u201cJessika Pava,\u201d says Finn. \u201cDancer. Captain Finn --\u201d</p>\n<p>His speech is the longest. Not one person thinks it should have been otherwise.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cMother, I\u2019m frightened,\u201d says Ben Solo, crouched in the snow, blood crusted on his face.</p>\n<p>It could be his. It could be someone else\u2019s. The air\u2019s got that sharp suck to it that heralds the arrival of snow, and the sky is bloated with cloud.</p>\n<p>\u201cMother,\u201d he says, again. He looks so very young. He\u2019s fifteen. The age he had been when he slaughtered the Jedi children, when --</p>\n<p>(do you think, says a voice she knows far too well, that he remembers their names?)</p>\n<p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t leave me,\u201d he says, \u201cI\u2019m hiding from them, I\u2019m here, I\u2019m on Octavia -- you know, it's on the Outer Rim, it's hidden away -- I didn't know where else to go -- they tried to kill me and I ran so far and so fast and I think they\u2019ve found me, I think they have --\u201d</p>\n<p>Leia snaps awake. Her brother, curse him, has sensed her agitation and is already in her quarters.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s here,\u201d he says, \u201clanded not half an hour ago -- I felt him.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s a trap.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cObviously.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re going, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s my son. I have to.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll come with you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo you won\u2019t. Someone needs to stay behind and lead the revolution if --\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t even <em> say </em>it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>This is Octavia: millions and millions of miles away, a planet of ice and trees and snow, where nothing lives, nothing at all.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou are <em> not </em>going alone,\u201d snaps Finn.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, I am,\u201d Rey snaps back. Her hands quiver. Her breath is stuttering, metallic and hard, and she forces herself to calm down, because breathing too hard and too deeply still pains her.</p>\n<p>She tastes blood. Old blood, cooked onto the lining of her throat from the surgery.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to be alone. The general\u2019s coming.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhich is also fucking stupid,\u201d Poe chimes in. \u201cGeneral -- ma\u2019am -- <em> Leia </em>. You know it\u2019s a trap, right? He\u2019ll kill you!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s my son.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe was Han\u2019s son too -- do you remember what happened to him?\u201d</p>\n<p>Leia hisses in a breath. Poe\u2019s eyes widen, like he can\u2019t quite believe what words are tripping off his tongue, and he starts to apologise, but the General cuts him off. \u201cI know. But I have to. I can\u2019t fail my children. I can\u2019t be like...I can\u2019t be like someone I knew, a very long time ago. Besides. I need you here. I need you to help Luke and Chewie consolidate our victory.\u201d</p>\n<p>She reaches up and touches his face, and Poe\u2019s eyes flutter closed; he catches her hand, presses it against his cheek.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re a good boy,\u201d she says. A pause. Then: \u201cI am so very proud of you. And I am sorry for leaving you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Things Rey notices: General Organa says <em> children </em>.</p>\n<p>Things Rey knows: Poe Dameron\u2019s parents died before he was twelve years old.</p>\n<p>Things Rey knows: family is who you choose. Always and forever, it is who you choose.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not leaving you,\u201d says Finn. Finn, the patron saint of revolution, Finn who was a Stormtrooper, Finn who is so full of love that he could splinter apart from it. \u201cYou can\u2019t make me leave you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou have a duty here,\u201d Rey says. \u201cJust as I have a destiny. The Force knows that I have to face Ren --\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFuck the Force! Let me send in soldiers, let me bomb the entire planet\u00a0to nothing, let me -- let me <em> help </em>--\u201d and his eyes are wet, and his hands are shaking and he once ran halfway across the universe to save this girl, this beautiful mad girl, and the thought of her running off one way while Poe stays somewhere else --</p>\n<p>His heart is being pulled into three, dripping handfuls.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou can\u2019t,\u201d he says, \u201cyou <em> can\u2019t </em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI <em> have </em>to,\u201d Jedi girl with stars in her bones, eyes that encompass all the skies that ever were, and he kisses her, kisses her long and deep, kisses her until Poe clears his throat delicately.</p>\n<p>\u201cIf there\u2019s a chance he can be saved,\u201d Leia says. \u201cI have to...I have to see.\u201d</p>\n<p>Finn grabs Poe\u2019s hand, squeezes so tightly that bones crack. \u201cIf he kills her,\u201d he says, \u201cif he kills her, then --\u201d and he\u2019s astonished by the <em> fury </em> that runs through him, the same fury that snatched at him on the night Ithaka burned.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe won\u2019t. And you wouldn\u2019t, even if he did.\u201d</p>\n<p>Rey kisses Poe, and that\u2019s it. She\u2019s gone.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy is the general not here to accept my surrender?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMaybe because she\u2019s got better things to do,\u201d Phasma says. \u201cLike cleaning her teeth. Or brushing her hair. It takes a lot of maintenance. The hair, that is.\u201d</p>\n<p>The Major slants a look to Poe, quirks a brow in query.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat is precisely how you banter, Ma,\u201d he says, happily. \u201cI\u2019m so glad you\u2019re learning.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI will shoot you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo you won\u2019t. Leia\u2019ll <em> never </em> go out with you if you kill her favourite pilot.\u201d</p>\n<p>Phasma flushes hard, from jaw to temple. \u201cI -- I -- \u201c</p>\n<p>\u201cEveryone can see it, you <em> idiot </em> . I\u2019m giving you my official permission to try and <em> tap that </em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe are in <em> delicate peace talks --\u201d </em></p>\n<p>\u201cNo we\u2019re not. She\u2019s surrendered, right?\u201d</p>\n<p>Asric\u2019s jaw is taut. She nods.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell then, let\u2019s lock the bitch up.\u201d</p>\n<p>They are using one of the old barracks as a prison.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s funny, Poe thinks. Prisons were the mark of tyranny. And now they say something very different: this is where people go because we do not kill them. This is where they are tried.</p>\n<p>This is where we build justice, from the ground up, with words and trials and judges and juries.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>They have Luke check General Asric, just to be sure.</p>\n<p>When he\u2019s finished with her, his face is very pale.</p>\n<p>\u201cKylo\u2019s...Kylo\u2019s talking to people who aren\u2019t there. He\u2019s ranting about names and legacy and blood in his mouth and...oh my sister, oh my sweet sister, what have I let you go to meet?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOnce,\u201d says a man Kylo Ren does not recognise, \u201cin a galaxy far far away, and a long time ago, there was a man. He had a wife he loved, and two children he loved more than the world, but the world was vast and cruel and the man feared for the safety of his children and his bride. And so he set a fire, he set a great and terrible fire, and it ate up everything he loved. And he lived a long and lonely life, and there was no end. And then, one day, he found that the fire was being relit, by a boy who could not remember the names of those he killed. What does that mean? What does that mean to you, grandson mine?\u201d</p>\n<p>Kylo Ren doesn\u2019t hear him.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s got his hands clamped over his ears. Blood sizzles against his lower lip. He\u2019s chewed his cheeks to rubble, because if he opens his mouth to speak --</p>\n<p>Well. He\u2019s terrified of what he might say.</p>\n<p>(<em> there is always a choice and --) </em></p>\n<p>\n<em> (and what if I made the wrong --) </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em> (made the wrong one?) </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your name, child?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cS-sekhmet.

Uh.\u201d</p>\n<p>Phasma cups the girls chin, tilts her head this way and that, notes the splatter of purple bruises on her throat.</p>\n<p>\u201cMy name is Phasma,\u201d she says, \u201cI was a Stormtrooper, and no one will ever touch you again, be sure of it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUh. Snap. Folks call me Snap. What\u2019s yours? Uh -- where are your clothes?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m Osma.\u201d</p>\n<p>Some Stormtroopers are unsure of physical things, and take things slowly.</p>\n<p>Others do not.</p>\n<p>\u201cVictory party?\u201d says Osma, with a wink and a smile.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI fucking hate you, First Order shitbag.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI want to pop out your other eye, illiterate rebel scum.\u201d</p>\n<p>Bren yanks Shannah Yvetta into a blokish hug, slapping his shoulderblades.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe won,\u201d he says, \u201cno thanks to you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGo fuck yerself,\u201d says Yvetta. \u201cAnd thanks for not dying.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou too, brother. You too.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Ben Solo embraces his mother. He is bloody-mouthed and shaking, burbling names to himself like a prayer, and she holds him, the warm fall of son against her chest, his gangling arms looped around her.</p>\n<p>\u201cMother, I\u2019m sorry,\u201d he says, \u201cI\u2019m so sorry. There\u2019s a choice, always a choice, and I made the wrong one, I made the wrong one. I remember their names, I remember who they are, I <em> remember </em>--\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh Ben. Oh <em> Ben --\u201d </em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em> -- </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>That is not what happens.</p>\n<p>For a moment, just a moment, Leia allows herself to wish it.</p>\n<p>The snow is an iron cascade. The stars glimmer between scuffs of wolf-grey cloud. All is very still. The Force is singing, high and sweet, with the aftershocks of victory -- but there is a lower note, a challenge, something dark and slinking, and she knows that in the woods of Octavia\u00a0her son</p>\n<p>(stalks)</p>\n<p>walks like a beast with blood on its breath, waiting.</p>\n<p>In her hand is Luke\u2019s lightsabre. At her side is a girl who seems <em> achingly </em>familiar and --</p>\n<p>The thought is amputated in a flat white strike.</p>\n<p>She\u2019s lifted off the ground, gasping, gagging for breath -- her lungs constricting <em> squeezing </em>-- like a durasteel corset, like --</p>\n<p>(once there was a mother)</p>\n<p>(and she set a fire)</p>\n<p>-- and she hears a distant voice crying her name and she sees her brother and tastes blood and --</p>\n<p><br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> </p>\n<p>watch the horizon</p>\n<p><br>\n</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a storm building on the flanks of a planet so shit and tiny it doesn\u2019t even have a name.</p>\n<p>The lightning lashes down, hard and sharp like it wants to burrow up inside the earth, like it\u2019s scared of whatever snarls in the skies.

The passion and power of the Dark is the true purpose of the Force; the Light, with its weakness, is nothing but a lie.)</p>\n<p>Imara Ren is of Twi\u2019lek origin. She\u2019s got very sharp teeth, and sea-foam blue skin, and she moves like the lightning, here and there, fast as thought. She wields two lightsabres, both double ended, and the effect is of mad, dancing starfire, swinging about her.</p>\n<p>\u201cCome for me,\u201d she coos, \u201ccome forth, Last of the Jedi, come forth Luke Skywalker --\u201d</p>\n<p>Luke\u2019s lightsabre shines bright as any star.</p>\n<p>But it doesn\u2019t move an inch.</p>\n<p>It doesn\u2019t have to.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em> Fire </em>,\u201d barks out Finn.</p>\n<p>Imara, to her credit, blocks the first hundred shots.</p>\n<p>But then there are a hundred more.</p>\n<p>And a hundred more.</p>\n<p>And a hundred more.</p>\n<p><br>\n</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>A very long time ago -- a <em> very </em> long time ago -- there was an Order. Order Sixty Six, it was called.</p>\n<p>Finn does not know this.</p>\n<p>What he does know is that a lightsabre can do much -- a good soldier (and good soldiers are never alone) \u00a0can do <em> more </em>.</p>\n<p><br>\n</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Luke Skywalker, before Leia left:</p>\n<p>\u201cI want to come with you. If you meant to bring him to justice, then I must be there -- I am --\u201d</p>\n<p>The words not spoken: a better fighter than you; I defeated him once I can and will do so again; darling sister, do not face this monster alone.</p>\n<p>In response, Leia cradles her twin\u2019s face. His cheeks are hollowed by isolation; her palms roughened by work. \u201cIt has to be. Don\u2019t you see? It has to be me.\u201d</p>\n<p>And it is not a prophecy, it is not an order, it is not anything more or less than this: she is his mother.</p>\n<p>He is hers.</p>\n<p>And she opens her mind to him, tilting her forehead forwards so they can touch brows, and he slides into her thoughts as though they are a warm tide-swell on the planet he once called home.</p>\n<p>He sees: Ben Solo, five years old, fireflies tangled in his hair. Ben Solo, ten years old, the shadow of Snoke looming obscene behind him.</p>\n<p>He sees: Kylo Ren redeemed.</p>\n<p>He sees: what Leia will do if he cannot be.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh sister,\u201d he breathes, \u201coh no, you can\u2019t -- he is your <em> son </em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd so I owe it to him that it is <em> me </em>,\u201d she says. \u201cDo you understand? It\u2019s the last kindness I can give him. It\u2019s the only way to save him.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Before she leaves, he presses their father\u2019s lightsabre into her hand.</p>\n<p>Her fingers tighten on it. Her eyes are stone.</p>\n<p>\u201cIf,\u201d he says, \u201cif -- if you do what you intend, it will kill you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo it won\u2019t,\u201d she says, trailing her fingers along his cheek, big-sister authority, the strength of a Princess and a General, of a mother and a widow and a Queen. Leia Organa, who always knows precisely where she stands. \u201cI have lived through much, and I will live through this and -- and if he kills me then --\u201d Her voice catches. She closes her eyes, swallows, and manages, \u201cThen I will die knowing that I did right by my child. I will not fail him again Luke, I will <em> not </em>--\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh Leia. You never failed him at all. Can\u2019t you see that? Can\u2019t you see that?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Phasma does not go to the tiny, nameless planet where Imara Ren makes her last stand. Someone must stay behind, and she does, and she finds herself the subject of another promotion, and it is Colonel Phasma who leaves her tent to find a spectacular array of small, half-formed creatures waiting for her.</p>\n<p>(A note: Phasma does not understand children. They are caught in the throes of transformation, erratic as terranterrors, and they make her a little uneasy. Stormtroopers were not children. Stormtroopers were cadets, were would-be and will-be; they were soldiers-to-be who happened to be smaller. And now she is faced with a bundle of madcap potential that could go anyway at all, and it frightens her a little.)</p>\n<p>Anyway. The half-formed things -- <em> children </em>, Phasma corrects -- are ranked up in neat rows. At least they have good posture.</p>\n<p>Every Resistance camp bulges at the seams with children. The camp on Persephone is no exception, despite the fact it was a warzone until two days ago -- in those two days no fewer than twelve personnel carriers have arrived, unpacking shivering huddles of boys and girls who are not soldiers-to-be but something else, something more.</p>\n<p>\u201cColonel?\u201d says one. It\u2019s a she. Possibly. It has short \u00a0hair, and bright eyes, but most things of that age -- prepubescent, Phasma thinks -- have short hair and bright eyes and somewhat chubby features. \u201cI am Ninety-Twenty-Eight-Six. I am...I <em> was </em> part of the Stormtrooper programme. And uh. I am not anymore. And neither are any of us and we\u2019re good with things, good with mechanics, and we asked the Resistance fighters,\u201d here there is a sudden burst of clapping.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s something a little forced about it.</p>\n<p>Phasma remembers when she was that small, shouting and stamping her feet whenever the name <em> Snoke </em> was mentioned, because not showing enough enthusiasm would mean attention paid to you and even at that age (before her growth spurt, before muscle, before <em> anything </em>) you knew that attention paid to you was not a good thing.</p>\n<p>\u201cSettle down,\u201d she says, attempting to mimic the effortless casual tone Dameron uses with his pilots.</p>\n<p>At once, the children snap to attention. Wide eyes. Straight shoulders.</p>\n<p>Something curdles in Phasma\u2019s stomach.</p>\n<p>Once, the sight of so many would-be soldiers with such good reflexes, such respect, would have filled her with pride. Now -- now she knows they are not soon-to-be soldiers but children, now she knows that there is a difference between fear and respect.</p>\n<p>She says, \u201cCall me Phasma,\u201d because names, names are important.</p>\n<p>\u201cPhasma,\u201d says the leader. It is brown in colour, wearing the black pyjamas that are mandatory for every child destined to become a trooper. \u201cWe wanted to give you a gift. And we asked the Resistance,\u201d this time there is no clapping, just an earnest sense of <em> listening </em>which is quite different to any other kind of silence, \u201cthe pilots, and they said that they\u2019d help us -- and --\u201d</p>\n<p>(Phasma thinks: they\u2019re not naming which pilots helped them, in case this backfires, in case this earns punishment. They don\u2019t want the blame to spread. They know that. They are so young, and they already know that.)</p>\n<p>(For a fervent moment, she wishes Hux was still breathing, so she might have the pleasure of shooting him again.)</p>\n<p>\u201c -- and we made this,\u201d and the children step apart, formation opening up like a blossom, and in the middle are two of the smallest creatures (<em> children </em>) that Phasma has ever seen, and in their hands is a shining chrome helmet.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe know you lost the other one,\u201d says the leader. \u201cUh. And we had it -- um -- we had it customised.\u201d</p>\n<p>She -- he? -- pronounces the word <em> customised </em>like it\u2019s foreign.</p>\n<p>It is. Of course it is. Stormtroopers do not customise anything.</p>\n<p>Phasma takes the helmet from the two tiny things, and holds it aloft. It is remarkably similar to her old one, only at the back someone has lasered an inscription:</p>\n<p>MA</p>\n<p>BECAUSE SHE SAVED US.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s something wrong with Phasma\u2019s eyes. They\u2019re hot and itchy and <em> wet </em> and it\u2019s this ghastly Persephone air; there\u2019s too much ash in it.</p>\n<p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she says. This does not seem enough. She wracks her mind, unearths an image of the Wookie greeting the General.</p>\n<p>She catches the smaller of the children by the front of its pyjamas and lifts it up to her face. The child\u2019s eyes bug, but it doesn\u2019t thrash or whimer or whine; it was a trooper and knows better.</p>\n<p>Colonel Phasma bumps her nose against the cheek.</p>\n<p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she says, again, and drops it.</p>\n<p>Fortunately, children of that age bounce.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>On the planet with no name, when the battle is won, \u00a0pilots and ground troops reunite on a valley carved deep between the slick black mountains. The rain has abated, just a little, and it falls in a fine mist around the victors.</p>\n<p>There are so many people, and you can\u2019t tell one-time trooper from long-time Resistance fighter, because they\u2019re all in a mishmash of uniforms and armour -- that\u2019s Snap with white gauntlets, there\u2019s Bren in his old First Order boots and the bottle green jacket of a Resistance captain --</p>\n<p>(Hang on, that\u2019s <em> Poe\u2019s </em>. How did he --)</p>\n<p>But there\u2019s no time to consider, because Poe\u2019s got to keep going. People pat him on the back, start chants of his name --</p>\n<p>(<em> Dameron! Dameron!) </em></p>\n<p>-- offer him drinks, which he declines with a quick shake of his head --</p>\n<p>(\u201cHey, I think I\u2019m pregnant,\u201d says Ozzie to Snap.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s only been a week since we -- you know --\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m bleeding. That means I\u2019m pregnant, right?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cKriffing hell, what sort of sex ed did you get in the Order?\u201d)</p>\n<p>-- and on, and on, elation swelling the air around him, the bigness of victory stretching the valley to breaking point, tightening his throat --</p>\n<p>(\u201cCome to my quarters.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFuck you, First Order dick -- I don\u2019t swing that way!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWasn\u2019t talking to you, \u2018zetta! Shot-at-Dawn, you game?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPlease have some dignity Cap\u2019n.\u201d)</p>\n<p>-- and past all those stories, all those people, with hands and hearts full of triumph, past the stink of blood and the wild, electric thrill of <em> life </em> --</p>\n<p>(\u201cI loved her, I loved her so much --\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI know. Oh Fiver, oh sister, oh my sister --\u201d)</p>\n<p>-- and the battle, the battle is almost won -- for some it is won entirely, Knights of Ren dead and General Alaric surrendered and the First Order falling, falling, falling --</p>\n<p>(\u201cNo one\u2019s going to hurt you ever again, no one will ever touch you --\u201d)</p>\n<p>(\u201cHave you heard? There\u2019s correllian whisky by the kriffing barrel, these Ren bitches knew how to <em> live </em> --\u201d)</p>\n<p>And then, for some, the battle\u2019s still raging on.</p>\n<p>Finn\u2019s surrounded. Someone starts a chant of, \u201c<em> Finn! Finn! Finn! </em>\u201d and it spreads out like ripples in a pond, like wildfire, like --</p>\n<p>Like revolution.</p>\n<p>And someone sees him, and someone else calls out, \u201cLet the boy through!\u201d and Poe\u2019s all but shoved the last few metres into Finn\u2019s arms.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey,\u201d says the patron saint of revolution.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey,\u201d says the Resistance\u2019s best pilot.</p>\n<p>When they kiss, it\u2019s to a backdrop of song, of absolute feral joy, to people set free.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>That night, they somehow find a quiet space away from the celebrations.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy does Bren have my jacket?\u201d Poe says, because the enormity of <em> everything else </em>he wants to ask is threatening to break him apart.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, he didn\u2019t have anything else to wear. Just First Order uniform. You gave me that jacket, and I thought you wouldn\u2019t mind if I passed it on.\u201d</p>\n<p>Finn. His beautiful Finn who literally gave a man the jacket off his back.</p>\n<p>Poe kisses him. Finn responds eagerly, and it\u2019s something, it\u2019s something, but it isn\u2019t enough.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Morning on Persephone. A sky of grey and gold. Tendrils of sunlight bleeding into cloud, rain-wet earth, air thick with petrichor.</p>\n<p>Sekhmet Snapthorne\u2019s one of the first up.</p>\n<p>She watches the sun rise. Her wounds have cleared up pretty well, and the MedDroids have assured her that she isn\u2019t pregnant, so that\u2019s something.</p>\n<p>That\u2019s something, but it isn\u2019t enough.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s a good likeness!\u201d Poe says, almost <em> weeping </em>in mirth. Finn\u2019s mouth hangs slack.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell,\u201d he allows, \u201cit is that but uh. Why is it so big?\u201d</p>\n<p>Phasma claps her hand to Finn\u2019s shoulder. Finn\u2019s knees buckle.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt is a sign of respect,\u201d she says and once upon a time there was a Stormtrooper called FN-2187 and had you told him that Captain Phasma would single him out for praise he would have been terrified, tremor-struck and sweat-slick in heartbeats, for attention -- individual attention -- is not a good thing. This is what all troopers learn.</p>\n<p>But FN-2187 is gone and, for that matter, so is Captain Phasma -- it\u2019s Finn and Phasma who regard the painting of Finn that a group of enterprising troopers have daubed onto the blackened flank of a building that was once a barracks.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not that muscly,\u201d says Finn. \u201cAnd, uh, why is Poe clinging to my leg?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI think they copied some stuff off the old Resistance propaganda posters,\u201d says Phasma.</p>\n<p>\u201cThey\u2019ve got Rey down pretty well,\u201d says Poe. \u201cLook at her face. She looks ready to take on the First Order single-handedly.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yes. She does. There\u2019s none of the scavenger from Jakku on the paintings face. She\u2019s all warrior. Hard eyes and hard edges and it breaks his heart, because that\u2019s how they see her, that\u2019s how they remember her -- or, more precisely, that\u2019s how they see her because that\u2019s the way they\u2019ve been trained to see her. They have smoothed away her softness because they think to portray it would shame her. They have given her the cold eyes of a First Order general because this is what they think Finn wants.</p>\n<p>This is what it is to be a trooper: weakness is shameful, burn it away.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s very...nice,\u201d he says, to the artist. Her name is Shot-At-Dawn and her face is set in the same hard lines as Rey in the painting -- but his praise, tentative as it is, melts her.</p>\n<p>\u201cThank you sir!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCall me Finn.\u201d</p>\n<p>Leia and Rey have not yet returned.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Luke Skywalker meditates, calling for guidance.</p>\n<p>He gets one image, again and again: blood on snow. Broke-back trees framed black against a star-strewn sky.</p>\n<p>His sister. His heartbeats and hers are one and the same, and he sees with her eyes, sees his nephew, as sharp and black as any of the trees. He sees his nephew lift a hand, clench his long fingers into a fist -- and he sees Leia lifted up, carried back on the long, hungry hands of the Force and -- \u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>Once upon a time there was a boy, and he loved his father</p>\n<p>Once upon a time, in a galaxy not so far away, there was a little boy and all he wanted to do was fly the Millenium Falcon and go on adventures and speak Wookie and learn to fix things. He loved fireflies and stories of the old times and he really liked his Uncle Luke (even if he was a little scared of him).</p>\n<p>And, once upon a time, that boy grew up. \u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Leia Organa dies in the snow. She dies with blood thick in her throat and the Force gnawing at her ribs, with the screams of the second-to-last Jedi ringing in her ears and --</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>That\u2019s not what happens.</p>\n<p>It could have done. It <em> could have done </em> -- and indeed Rey sees it happening, for the Force is cruel and shows <em> could bes </em> along with <em> this is what will </em>and prophecy is dumb animal wildness, not the precision that a long-dead order liked to pretend it was.</p>\n<p>Rey\u2019s vision goes warped and silver and strange and she sees Leia fall, sees blood bright on the snow, and she sees the woman stop breathing and --</p>\n<p>Then her eyes clear, and she heaves in air (metallic whir of the contraption in her throat keeping her alive) and sees Leia, brave and indomitable conqueror that she is, <em> stand </em>.</p>\n<p>She can barely do this. Her legs are aquiver and her mouth, her mouth is red and wet with blood --</p>\n<p>(blood in your mouth on waking, in your throat, let me tell you granddaughter mine --)</p>\n<p>(the Force is <em> cruel </em>--)</p>\n<p>And Rey hears a voice tangled in the wind, carried to her ears, she feels hands cup her chin, tilting her head this way and that -- and for a moment she leans into the spectral caress, barely cognizant of her surroundings.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a face. A man. Through him, she sees snow and broke-backed trees and Kylo Ren, red lightsabre crackling and spitting fury.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe won\u2019t listen to me. Will you, child?\u201d</p>\n<p>And then he\u2019s gone. Rey\u2019s lightsabre sings green.</p>\n<p>\u201cLet me <em> teach you </em>,\u201d she snarls, white-toothed and feral, and leaps forward.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Leia stands.</p>\n<p>Leia stands, and there are hands at her back, and someone is holding her up. A voice in her ear: <em> daughter mine, don\u2019t take after him. You\u2019re better than your father. Please know this. </em></p>\n<p>She\u2019s never heard <em> that </em>voice before.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em> -- </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d says Cass, \u201cFinn! What an absolute <em> honour </em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>The worst thing about this whole scene is that: the absolute, honest delight in Cass\u2019s eyes and voice. He\u2019s quite clearly jubilant, a little boy in the presence of his hero, practically vibrating with the urge to salute (but he doesn\u2019t, because he\u2019s heard how Finn dislikes the trappings of military honour).</p>\n<p>There\u2019s blood smeared on his knuckles, and a bleeding girl at his feet.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on here?\u201d says Finn. His voice is whip-tight, and Poe has to swallow back a hot surge of fury.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d says Cass. \u201cJust an altercation. This one --\u201d and he gestures at the girl with a cursory, dismissive flick of one wrist, \u201c--got two of us killed. Flies-Better and Tallymark. Good soldiers, or so I hear. She made...accusations. Anyway, I heard her talking with Reyma about it, saying how happy she was that they were gone -- that they wouldn\u2019t touch her again -- and she was all but gloating, and of course I dealt with it. Can\u2019t have the officers thinking they can get one over on us. I know that\u2019s what you always say.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI -- I -- I have <em> never said that </em>,\u201d and Cass\u2019s joy dims, just a little. It\u2019s replaced by bemusement.</p>\n<p>\u201cI heard that you did,\u201d he says and there you go, Poe thinks, there you go. I heard, I heard, I heard. \u201cI heard that you said that the officers were the real monsters, that the troopers were victims.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI -- I think I said something like that, yes, but I never said -- I <em> never said </em>-- that this -- that --\u201d</p>\n<p>Words fail him. He bends down and lifts the girl to her feet. Poe recognises her as Sekhmet. Her lovely face is a mask of blood.</p>\n<p>\u201cI never said this,\u201d says Finn. \u201cOh Force -- I never said this.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell,\u201d says Cass, now a little irritable. \u201cWhat do you expect? They oppressed us --\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd what do you think Stormtroopers did to Resistance fighters?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s --\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s not different.\u201d Finn\u2019s very deliberately not looking at Cass. He\u2019s mopping the blood from Sekhmet\u2019s face with gentle little dabs. The girl sways in his grasp. \u201cThat\u2019s not different at all. Everyone here\u2019s lost relatives to troopers or to Resistance fighters, or to Jedi or -- or anything. And we can\u2019t start taking revenge on each other because we\u2019ll tear ourselves apart.\u201d</p>\n<p>One last dab of the tissue. \u201cI\u2019m arresting you for assault,\u201d says Finn to Cass. There\u2019s an iron set to his jaw that makes Poe think of General Organa.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Finn\u2019s learning.</p>\n<p>Being the patron saint of revolution, the uncrowned king of one-time troopers, well. It\u2019s more than just speeches. It\u2019s a <em> legacy </em> and legacies are wild, burning things -- hard to grasp, hard to guide.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe thought I\u2019d be pleased,\u201d says Finn. \u201cHe thought I\u2019d -- I\u2019d be <em> pleased </em>. How could he thought that of me?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBecause he doesn\u2019t know you. Because he knows FN-2187-who-was-a-Stormtrooper, and he knows Finn patron-saint-of-revolution, and he knows the stories -- but the thing with stories is they change in the telling. People change stories so they mean whatever they want them to mean. Cass turned you into a story, and told himself what he wanted to hear.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Luke sees the fight unfurl through his sister\u2019s eyes. He sees Rey dance, wielding Anakin\u2019s old lightsabre like a staff -- because no amount of Jedi training will ever unmake the desert-scavenger survival song in her bones and he\u2019s to blame for that as well.</p>\n<p>(Once there was a father, and he tried to save his child, and he failed.)</p>\n<p>(Once there was a mother who should have never been a mother, a man too preoccupied with the war and --)</p>\n<p>Anyway. That is a story for another time. Luke is cross-legged, the Force curling around him like a snake with a mouse -- or a man with a favoured pet.</p>\n<p>Luke sees: Kylo pushing Rey\u2019s sabre down, smacking her in the face with a half-open palm, the blow of a boy who has never learned to fight with his fists. He sees Rey recover, come back furious, come back strong; he hears her breath, hard and rasping and metallic; he sees plumes of smoke in the star-filled air. He tastes his sister\u2019s despair, and her resolution.</p>\n<p>(<em> Once there was a mother who saved her children, even though it burned her alive -) </em></p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cCome and <em> get me </em> scavenger,\u201d barks Kylo Ren, and in a whirl of black he\u2019s gone, through the trees, through the snow and it\u2019s a trap, of course it\u2019s a trap; it\u2019s one of the first things you get taught about subterfuge; that a fake retreat is the perfect weapon against an opponent consumed by rage or hate; that retreating to better, higher ground gives you the perfect opportunity to double back, attack again.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s a trap.</p>\n<p>But what other choice do they have but to follow?</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The trial takes place in the middle of the Resistance encampment. To say it is <em> makeshift </em>is an understatement.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s a defense lawyer?\u201d says Phasma. \u201cWhy does he need one? He\u2019s guilty, that\u2019s why he\u2019s being brought to trial.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat is...not how trials work.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt is in the First Order,\u201d says Phasma. \u201cNo one is ever brought to trial unless there is concrete evidence of their guilt.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c...oh dear,\u201d says Poe.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The question is: what sort of world do you want to build?</p>\n<p>If you asked Poe he would say: where there\u2019s a senate, like the old days, and where everyone can vote for rules over them, and where the Jedi Order brings peace wherever they tread and --</p>\n<p>If you asked Finn he would say: a world where Rey can come home, and be safe. \u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>When Kylo turns to face them, it is at the top of a great canyon, jagged stone cleaving down to a tyrant of a river that froths at the mouth, shunting along chunks of ice the size of X Wings.</p>\n<p>The fall would kill. Rey supposes that this is the <em> point </em>.</p>\n<p>Kylo\u2019s Ren snarls, teeth and lips curling, and Rey thinks of dogs on Jakku, the mangy things that you\u2019d have to shoot when the madness took them, because it was kinder.</p>\n<p>He lunges forwards; the attack is absolute fury, hard swings and firesong of lightsabre and hate and this is the Force, this is it at its most elemental, a beast with curds of spit between its teeth.</p>\n<p>Rey falters under the onslaught.</p>\n<p>Kylo\u2019s swing would have cleaved her in two -- but though he is fast, Leia is faster, and the air thickens with the reek of cooked meat as Kylo Ren\u2019s arm topples away.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThe question is,\u201d says Finn. \u201cWhat sort of people do we want to be? Are we tools, are we monsters, are we everything that the First Order wanted us to be? Or are we something <em> more </em>?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>His lightsabre sizzling in the snow. His lips curled up, mad-dog snarl, and he stumbles back, and Rey remembers the sound, the exact sound, that Han Solo had made as he died: a low, hard breath, almost like a sigh but not quite, she remembers that and she swings her lightsabre, angling it deliberately so it doesn\u2019t go anywhere fatal; it skids along his leg, and the reek of burning flesh intensifies and Kylo Ren <em> howls </em>.</p>\n<p>He crumples to the ground.</p>\n<p>She could kill him. It would be so easy, so very easy --</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>There are some things only a mother can do.</p>\n<p>Leia\u2019s hand is gentle on Rey\u2019s elbow. She guides the quivering girl to the side and steels herself, lifting her lightsabre high for the killing blow.</p>\n<p><em> You\u2019re not the person I was </em> , says a male voice, low and urgent. <em> You\u2019re not the person I was Leia, Leia, Leia -- </em></p>\n<p><em> Leia, you can\u2019t -- this isn\u2019t what we </em> <b> <em>meant --</em> </b> the second voice, just as urgent, soft and singing, light as breath.</p>\n<p>There are tears stuck to Leia\u2019s lashes.</p>\n<p>Her hands shake.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI sentence you to ten years in prison,\u201d says Admiral Ackbar. \u201cAnd I strip you of your rank, and all military honours; you will never fight for us again. May this serve as a warning to those who would try and taint the New Republic with the brutality of the First Order. May it serve as reassurance to those who have been wronged that your voices will be heard, that you will be kept safe. May it serve as the foundation stone of a galaxy at peace, governed in justice and with wisdom.\u201d</p>\n<p>After the trial, Finn finds Shot-At-Dawn. Her hair is in an unkempt bun, paintbrushes stuck through it; flecks of paint are scattered like freckles on her nape.</p>\n<p>\u201cI loved the painting,\u201d he says, and again there\u2019s that flare of brilliance in her eyes, of utter delight. \u201cBut,\u201d he says, \u201cI think we can do better, if we do it together.\u201d</p>\n<p>She reaches up, pulls a paintbrush from her hair and offers it to him.</p>\n<p>The next mural is of Poe and Rey. They are embracing, lit by dawn-light, Rey in her scavenger scarf, the glint of her metal-throat a thing of absolute beauty -- for it keeps her alive and nothing that keeps Rey alive could be anything less than beauty -- and Poe, tousled and grinning as wide as the sky, in his pilot uniform, while BB-8 nudges at his leg.</p>\n<p>The real BB-8 gives them a fiery thumbs-up and chirrups encouragement.</p>\n<p>Yes, thinks Finn, as he fills in Rey\u2019s soft-curling hair. Yes, this is the sort of world I want to live in.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Luke jerks from meditation, his eyes filled with horror, his skin running cold, his bones aching, his hands spasming.</p>\n<p>On Octavia, the lightsabre falls.</p>\n<p><br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>A long time ago, on a planet a very long way away, a boy sat down with the two men who have come from the stars.</p>\n<p>He says, \u201cYou must know such amazing stories.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat I do,\u201d says the older of the two men. He has seen much, and done much, but there is youthful exuberance in his eyes. \u201cWould you like to hear my favourite?\u201d</p>\n<p>The boy nods. He is small for his age, fine-boned and soft-haired, and although his palms are work-blistered there\u2019s something innocent about him, something untouched.</p>\n<p>(The man knows this: the boy has a mother. The mother is more than work-blistered. She is bent-backed and tired-eyed and her energy, which is considerable, is focused upon her guarding her son. Hence his innocence. Hence his sky-open eyes and his concern for stories.)</p>\n<p>\u201cOnce,\u201d says the older man, \u201cthere was a young girl. She lived alone, but she was plagued by the monsters that dwelled in her desert home --\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh not <em> this one again </em>,\u201d chimes in the younger man. There\u2019s no petulance in his voice -- an observer would get the impression that this objection is just part of the story, part of the tradition. \u201cI\u2019ve heard it so many times before.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe all have,\u201d says the older man, \u201cfor it holds a valuable lesson.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, for --\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t interrupt!\u201d the boy chides, snapping his foot against the younger man\u2019s shin. \u201cI want to hear.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOi! Little Jedi respect their elders.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThen listen to your Master,\u201d says the older man. His lips curve in a slow, easy smile. His voice is gentle and hypnotic as wind over ocean, and he continues: \u201cThis girl lived alone in the desert, and she was much troubled by the monsters around her. These monsters took many forms: rathars and wolves and men, for monsters can walk on two legs or more, and the girl knew well the many faces of evil. And she was sore afraid of the night, for this was when the monsters would gnaw the edge of her home and call her name. And, one night, in her pain and fear and loneliness, she set a fire. She stoked it high, first with all the kindling she had, and then with her home, and then with the clothes off her back. And the fire burned up the monsters, and when morning came it still burned. She said to it: \u2018Your purpose is served, please go.\u2019 And the fire did not listen, and it tried to devour her as well.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut the girl was strong and canny, and though the fire scarred her it did not kill her, and she ran for miles and miles, bleeding and charred, and weeping -- for she saw the destruction her fire had wrought. Presently, she came to a village. There was a boy in the village, and he saw the state of the girl and said to her: \u2018Why do you cry? Why are you hurt?\u201d And she said: \u2018Leave me, leave me, I am burned because of the fire I have set.\u2019 And he said: \u2018You are hurting.\u2019 And she said: \u2018I deserve this hurt, I have hurt others. Let me die, so that I might pay penance for the fire.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd the boy was not satisfied with this answer, and he grew angry: \u2018You set this fire. You know where this fire is. No one else does. It is your responsibility to live, so that you may put it out. Nothing is gained by your death.\u2019\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe girl saw the wisdom in this, and she stood, and she drank the water the boy offered her and permitted him to tend to her wounds. And, together, they returned to the place where the fire still raged and, together, they put it out. And afterwards the girl said to the boy: \u2018Thank you, for you have saved me.\u2019 And the boy, who was rightly annoyed, said: \u2018I have saved no one; you have saved yourself. For that is the way it must be, and the way it always will be, Force permitting.\u2019\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd the girl saw the wisdom in this as well and said, \u2018We will journey together, and we will rest together, and we will find the fires that have been started by those like me.\u2019 And thus they did. And there was no end.\u201d</p>\n<p>The younger man claps. The older man bows, and smiles, and the boy looks confused.</p>\n<p>\u201cHow did the girl survive the fire?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s a parable, youngling,\u201d says the older man. \u201cIt might have happened; it might not. The point is not the story. The point is the lesson.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhich is?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIf I have to explain it to you, I am not a very good storyteller!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Later on, the boy becomes a young man and the young man becomes an older man, and there is no more time for stories under the stars. There is war, and pain, and forgetting and one day the older man looks to the younger man and says, \u201cDo you remember when we used to tell stories?\u201d</p>\n<p>And the younger man, who is full to the brim with fire and fury and that hideous, quaking fear that always accompanies anger says, \u201cNot especially.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMe neither,\u201d says the older man. \u201cThere was one...about a boy, I think. And a girl?\u201d</p>\n<p>He\u2019s scrounging for the words. He can\u2019t find them.</p>\n<p>\u201cSomething about a fire,\u201d says the young man, \u201cabout starting a fire, and not being able to control it. The Council loves that sort of shit. Do not start fires, they eat you up. Don\u2019t change anything, it\u2019ll destroy you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s what the story meant--\u201d</p>\n<p>But the young man is gone.</p>\n<p>The older man, who will one day soon be an <em> old </em> man, can\u2019t dispute the claim.</p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t remember the story either.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSo,\u201d says Poe. \u201cTrials. Really?\u201d</p>\n<p>Finn nods. \u201cIf we\u2019re going to kill people,\u201d he says, \u201cwe\u2019ve got to have a reason for it. We\u2019re building a new world. We\u2019re building a Republic. We can\u2019t have it built on blood and battlefields. We just <em> can\u2019t </em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>Poe presses his face into the curve of Finn\u2019s neck. Finn smells warm and fresh, like rain on spring grass, and -- and yet it isn\u2019t enough because somewhere, somewhere very far away, Rey is fighting for her life, fighting a different kind of battle.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ll start with Asric\u2026\u201d Finn says, absently, raising one hand to toy with a curl of Poe\u2019s hair. There\u2019s paint flecked over his knuckles. \u201cAnd --\u201d</p>\n<p>That\u2019s when Luke Skywalker, ever the mood-killer, bursts into their tent. There are tears in his eyes. \u201cWe have to go to Octavia. She\u2019s killed him. My sister -- she -- she\u2019s killed her son, oh Leia, my sweet Leia, I am <em> sorry </em> --\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>This is what happens, at the top of a deep gouge in the rock, above a river where chunks of ice the size of X Wings float along, buffeted by wavelets.</p>\n<p>Leia\u2019s lightsabre comes down.</p>\n<p>It is a killing blow. It will go through Kylo Ren\u2019s breastplate and into his heart and in one sweep it will end him. His heart will not struggle on -- it will die in a flash, cooked flesh and congealing blood. His lungs will flutter once or twice, but no more. It will be quick.</p>\n<p>Except, of course, it is not.</p>\n<p>Kylo Ren gathers what remains of his strength and <em> focuses </em>and the lightsabre\u2019s course is diverted, swinging not onto his chest but across his hip, thigh, leg. Leia, astonished, flounders -- just for a moment.</p>\n<p>It is long enough.</p>\n<p>Another <em> shove </em> and this one is not aimed at his mother, or at the girl.</p>\n<p>Kylo Ren uses the last of his power to propel himself back over the cliff. He falls in a fluster of black, like a great broken-winged bird, falling until he is but a dot; and he smacks the water with an impact that rings up the canyon walls; and he does not surface.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI haven\u2019t forgiven him, you know.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWho the hell are you?\u201d</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a woman in Finn\u2019s bedroom. She\u2019s sad-eyed and beautiful, and <em> translucent. </em></p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re dreaming, little one. I wanted to talk to you. I wanted to see the boy who\u2019s making the universe sing.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cStill. Who are you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cForgive me -- I\u2019ve forgotten my manners. My name is Padme.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t know that name.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo one does. I was a Queen once, and a soldier, and a mother -- and I have seen such dreadful things done in my name, things I never wanted done.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMe too.\u201d</p>\n<p>The woman walks with eerie, hypnotic grace. Her feet barely graze the floor. \u201cHe loved me. He still does. And he did terrible things to save me. He never once asked -- is this what she wants? Is this what she would desire, does she think this is worth it?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cA man almost beat a child to death because he thought I\u2019d want it,\u201d Finn says. He wets his lips. Padme sits on the side of the bed. \u201cThere are pictures of me -- paintings -- and I look...I look like a killer. They paint me with First Order blood on my hands. I don\u2019t want that. I don\u2019t want to lose control of my story.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo. So you take control of it yourself. You fight for what you want, you say what you want, over and over -- and yet people will still ignore that, and paste their words over yours, and your life will be a ceaseless struggle against this.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThey call me the patron saint of revolution.\u201d</p>\n<p>Padme\u2019s lip curls. \u201cHe called me his only reason for living, and burned up the galaxy for me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cJust one man? I\u2019ve got almost ten billion former troopers singing my name, and God knows what they\u2019re doing.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOne man can do much, when he is a Skywalker.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh <em> dear </em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p>\n<p>They sit in silence for a while. It\u2019s a good silence, a comfortable silence, the silence of two people who perfectly understand each other.</p>\n<p>Then Finn says, \u201cYou mean Vader, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe prefers Anakin -- but, yes, I do.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo you\u2019re\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLuke\u2019s mother. And Leia\u2019s.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI can see where they get their looks from.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em> Flirt </em>.\u201d She laughs and Finn, despite himself, grins back.</p>\n<p>\u201cLuke told me. Most people don\u2019t know. They, uh. They wouldn\u2019t understand. Wouldn\u2019t look at Leia the same way -- or Luke. They wouldn\u2019t know that he redeemed himself, that --\u201d Finn bites his lower lip. Hangs his head. \u201cYou know all that. But -- but you said that you haven\u2019t forgiven him.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo. It...it is different for Luke. He sees his father as a brave and noble man, corrupted by the Dark Side. I saw Vader\u2019s birth throes. I saw Anakin choose, again and again, to do evil. I saw him darken, I saw him fall, and I saw him justify every step with my name. How can I forgive that? How can I forgive the man who murdered children to save me?\u201d Her hand lifts, rubs against her throat, and there Finn sees the dim shadow of a bruise. \u201cHe destroyed everything I built.\u201d</p>\n<p>Finn takes her hand. It\u2019s like holding water that keeps its shape by a constant, swirling current.</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you miss him?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo. I am a Queen, and I am a politician, and I am used to loss.\u201d Her chin goes up. Finn knows what a liar looks like, but he doesn\u2019t say it.</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what to do,\u201d says Finn. \u201cI\u2019m...I was a Stormtrooper, and now I\u2019m the head of a fucking revolution -- only it isn\u2019t a revolution, not anymore, it\u2019s a Republic and I\u2019m <em> scared </em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re a good man, Finn.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, but is that enough?\u201d</p>\n<p>Padme kisses him. It\u2019s a very strange kiss. It feels like water pressing against his lips, and also like the touch of a summer breeze, and brings to mind -- for some reason -- Rey, just after she\u2019s finished training, when she\u2019s all hot with tension and tacky with sweat.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s chaste and sweet and over in a moment.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt has to be,\u201d she says.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou were a good person,\u201d he says, suddenly frantic, \u201cand you failed and --\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut you keep trying. That\u2019s what the Light side is. Endless and endless, sure as the tide, never giving in.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>This is what revolution is, Finn thinks.</p>\n<p>Over and over. Never giving in.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kylo Ren falls and falls and hits the water and it\u2019s like hitting durasteel -- wet crack as bones break -- blood swills into his mouth, teeth splinter, tongue shredded, and his vision fades into black and in the black he sees a face, a scarred and grinning face, an ancient face --</p>\n<p><em> Your training is complete, </em> says Lord Snoke. <em> You understand my final lesson -- </em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Once, not so long ago, there was a old man and he faced someone who had been a young man and was now an older man -- for a given value of man.</p>\n<p><em> \u201c </em>You can't win. If you strike me down, I shall become more powerful than you can possibly imagine,\u201d says the old man.</p>\n<p>The older\u00a0man does not listen.</p>\n<p>The old man falls.</p>\n<p>The old man\u00a0<em>wins</em>.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kylo Ren sinks deeper under the waves. All is black, and all is blood.</p>\n<p>His lungs scream with pain. All he need to is open his mouth, allow the water to flood in, die. He will die, and the Force will take his spirit, and he can serve the Dark Side as he was always meant to. He will be free -- finally free -- of the constrainments of life, of the call of the Light. He will be as a god, a god with blood on his breath and a hunt in his heart; he can purge the Force from the inside out; Snoke will kneel to him; the galaxy in its entirety will kneel, whether they wish to or not --</p>\n<p>\n<em> (once there was an emperor and he got everything he ever wanted --) </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em> (Snoke wanted to die, can\u2019t you see? can\u2019t you see? there was a boy, and he was on fire, only the old man wanted him to be only --) </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em> (nothing is ever your choice) </em>\n</p>\n<p><em> (no: everything is. You\u2019ve just made the </em> <b> <em>wrong ones)</em> </b></p>\n<p>He can finally be worthy of his grandfather\u2019s name --</p>\n<p><em> Kylo </em> . <em> Kylo listen to me -- </em></p>\n<p>His feet brush the bottom of the river. He\u2019s hanging slack, pushed this way and that by the waves, but his lungs refuse to co-operate. He breathes out -- silvery bubbles float like constellations to the surface -- and the grasp on his chest tightens.</p>\n<p>\n<em> Your training -- </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em> Your training is complete, child, you are my successor, you will -- </em>\n</p>\n<p>Will what?</p>\n<p>A final bubble pops free.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHere we go,\u201d says Finn, presenting a still-wet watercolour to Poe. \u201cIsn\u2019t it lovely?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUh -- you\u2019ve really captured Chewie\u2019s feminine grace.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s Leia, you dick.\u201d</p>\n<p>Poe smirks, gets a kiss for his troubles.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re almost there,\u201d Luke says. \u201cI can feel my sister\u2019s pain -- I -- \u201c And his voice fractures like winter ice, snapping open, and his head bows.</p>\n<p>The mood sours in a heartbeat. Finn shoves the painting aside, runs his hand along Luke\u2019s shoulder. \u201cShe did the only thing she could have done.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShe blames herself for it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cKylo Ren was no one\u2019s fault but Kylo Ren\u2019s,\u201d says Poe, showing his teeth. \u201cHe chose to be a murdering bastard. No one made him. I mean, look at Finn. Raised to be a trooper, and now the best and bravest man I know. Doesn\u2019t matter who your parents are; it matters what you choose.\u201d</p>\n<p>Luke reaches up, takes Finn\u2019s hand.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><em> Breathe in </em>, Snoke says.</p>\n<p>\n<em> Grandfather I want to be worthy of you -- </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u201cYou stupid <em> bastard </em>,\u201d and Kylo Ren\u2019s head snaps to the side. Someone\u2019s hit him across the face.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s underwater, he sees nothing but black and black and --</p>\n<p>No he\u2019s not. He\u2019s standing on sand, and in the distance twin suns slink towards the horizon.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s someone holding him by the front of his robes. It\u2019s a man, a little shorter than him, a little younger -- tangle of hair and a scar crooked over one eye and s<em> o very familiar </em> --</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you listening to me? Are you finally listening? Are you?\u201d</p>\n<p>The man drops him. Kylo sprawls onto the sand in a useless tangle of limbs. He can\u2019t breathe -- the air is too hot, snatching at the lining of his throat -- and he cannot stand and --</p>\n<p>The man. The man overbrimming with rage. His eyes are bitter, bright yellow, like the eyes of some venomous predator and he strides back and forth, kicking at the ground, sending up flurries of grit.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d Kylo manages. \u201cI am -- I am --\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou filthy fucking coward. Do you want to live up to my legacy? Then you\u2019re going the right way about it!\u201d The man kneels, grabs Kylo\u2019s chin. \u201cYou\u2019re going to die, and you and Snoke will unseat the balance of the Force for <em> years </em>. The Force is a wild animal and you\u2019re going to be a shot of adrenalin under its skin. Do you know what that will do to the universe? To the Jedi?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>They meet in a clearing, acres of black sky above, acres of black forest around. Snow crackles underfoot, and the air thrums with frost.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou did the right thing,\u201d says Luke to Leia and he\u2019s right, he\u2019s right, but that doesn\u2019t make it any easier.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>BB-8 rolls into Rey\u2019s lap and refuses to budge. <em> Don\u2019t leave again Friend Rey, </em> he chirrups, <em> don\u2019t you ever leave again, don\u2019t ever leave again. </em></p>\n<p>Finn on one side, Poe on the other, how it should be, how it should always be. Rey squeezes her eyes tight shut, tears scalding tracks down her numb cheeks. Poe kisses one earlobe, Finn kisses her jugular and Chewie, deciding that what these cubs need more than anything is a hug, scoops the three of them into his lap and buries his face into Rey\u2019s hair.</p>\n<p><em> \u201cLittle ones,\u201d </em> he croons, low and throaty, \u201c<em>little ones, so far from home. The battle is won. Han is avenged.\u201d </em></p>\n<p><em> \u201cHe\u2019d hate us for it,\u201d </em> Rey says, for the tears she sheds are not for the Knight who tumbled from a cliff but for the man who looked on her with kindness, for the man who offered her a job, for the closest thing to a father she has ever known. \u201c<em>We did the right thing, and it\u2019s still the worst thing in the world.\u201d </em></p>\n<p>\n<em> \u201cThere is a choice, a choice, always a choice. And the choice is not always pleasant, and it is not always good, but you must make it.\u201d </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em> -- </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cMy name,\u201d says the man, \u201cis Anakin Skywalker.\u201d</p>\n<p>Kylo Ren knows. To some extent, he\u2019s always known.</p>\n<p>\u201cGrandfather. I -- I don\u2019t deserve to live, do I? You\u2019re right. I can\u2019t remember the names of those I\u2019ve killed, and I\u2019m a -- I\u2019m a coward, I\u2019m nothing, I\u2019m not worthy of you --\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you <em> deaf?\u201d </em> And Anakin, on his knees, smacking\u00a0his grandson across the cheek, his teeth showing white and terrible and the Force straining at the seams, flood of dark and despair and <em> pain </em> and this is the Dark Side, this is the <em> real </em> Dark Side: the slow and awful fatigue of <em> giving up </em>. \u201cThat\u2019s not what I said! That is not what I said!\u201d</p>\n<p>People tell themselves the stories they want to hear.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI had to write a will,\u201d says Finn.</p>\n<p><em> Do not leave Friend Rey, do not ever leave again -- what is a will? </em> chirrups BB-8. <em> It is something humans write when they are going to die -- you are not going to die! Friend Finn is not going to die, not now, not ever </em>-- his beeps are getting shrill with panic, and Rey soothes a hand over his shell.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s not going to die, BB-8.\u201d</p>\n<p>\n<em> Love Friend Finn, Friend Finn cannot die. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u201cWe love him to; he\u2019s not going to die.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em> Anyway </em> . I had to write a will, and it had a space for <em> surname </em>and I didn\u2019t know what to put, so uh -- I hope it\u2019s okay but --\u201d</p>\n<p>Poe straightens his shoulders a fraction.</p>\n<p>\u201c--I put Organa.\u201d</p>\n<p>Poe\u2019s shoulders slump. The General smiles.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat is fine with me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCan I be Organa too?\u201d says Rey. \u201cOnly...surnames are about family, right? And Finn\u2019s my family, and so are you and --\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat is also fine,\u201d says Leia, and there\u2019s something approaching happiness in her eyes; but the rest of her is bent-backed and broken as the trees, as the cracks in the earth. She looks like a woman who has walked through hell.</p>\n<p>\u201cPoe can be an Organa too.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI <em> have </em> a surname, you know.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, but -- but you can have two? I want you to share it with us. I want you to be part of the family as well.\u201d There\u2019s something childlike about Rey\u2019s insistence. She stares at their clasped hands. \u201cI don\u2019t want us to...to break apart. I want us to stay together, I want -- I don\u2019t want to be left again,\u201d she finishes, soft and lost, and Poe kisses her.</p>\n<p>It starts off discreet enough, but then Rey parts her lips a little and it is decidedly <em> not </em> discreet, and BB-8 beeps protest.</p>\n<p>\n<em> If you are going to mate, do it elsewhere! </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em> -- </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>So they do.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>This is Phasma\u2019s experience of trials to date: the miscreant is found doing something wrong, or an official document is produced that says they have been doing something wrong and this is all the proof that is needed. The trial is an excellent chance to highlight the individual\u2019s failings -- these failings are, of course, an anamoly and the individual in question is either:</p>\n<p>and both of these are things that absolve the First Order of any responsibility -- it was not a failing in the programming, or choice, but some external factor -- madness or rebellion, and once upon a time those were both the same thing -- and, thus, the individual was carved from the flank of the order like cancer from a host.</p>\n<p>The end.</p>\n<p>However. The Resistance does things a little differently.</p>\n<p>Maz Kanata says, \u201cShe needs a lawyer. I will be the lawyer.\u201d</p>\n<p>Phasma says, \u201cShe does not need a lawyer. She needs a blaster to the head.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou do not understand democracy, do you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI understand that the majority of people wish her dead; that the majority of troopers have seen the horrors she has committed; that democracy is, after all, the will of the many. Thus, it is democratic to kill her.\u201d</p>\n<p>Maz sniggers. \u201cYou\u2019re more than just a pretty face, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p>\n<p>Phasma, who has never been called <em> a pretty face </em> , let alone <em> just a pretty face </em> is stumped. Her mouth opens and shuts.</p>\n<p>Maz pats her knee. \u201cLook, dearie, it goes like this. I\u2019ll say why she\u2019s innocent. You -- or someone else -- say why she\u2019s guilty. It\u2019s the way it\u2019s got to work.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut she\u2019s guilty,\u201d says Phasma.</p>\n<p>\u201cWho says so? You?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell -- myself and my troopers --\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd if I were to say that you, Phasma, should go on trial for your crimes, and that I could find a thousand or so civilians who would gladly call for your head -- would you want to have a lawyer then, or is their condemnation enough?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell. If my troopers said I was a poor leader, I would allow myself to be killed. Civilians\u2026\u201d Her voice trails off. She\u2019s moments from saying <em> don\u2019t count </em> but she\u2019s learned enough of this strange new world to understand that this is not an acceptable turn of phrase.</p>\n<p>Maz rolls her eyes. \u201cAnother example then. I say that Shot-At-Dawn was stealing bread. Shot-At-Dawn says she was not. Who do you believe?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShot-At-Dawn --\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBecause she is a trooper, yes. And another question. Hux is caught with a girl who is not keen on the idea of being with him. Who do you believe? The girl or Hux?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe girl --\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy? Hux is a soldier, a general. His word means more than hers.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat is <em> not the same </em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it? When we start ranking people according to some arbitrary scale of how good they are, we put the power into the hands of people and <em> people </em> are flawed and fallible and <em> dim </em>.\u201d Maz nods once, decisively. \u201cYou\u2019ll give me a week to prepare my defense. Ackbar can serve as judge.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Finn\u2019s having a piss in the woods when destiny comes knocking.</p>\n<p>\u201cStormtrooper -- oh, <em> come on!\u201d </em> a voice barks.</p>\n<p>Finn shoves himself back into his pyjamas, and spins around, hand flying to his blaster.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a man. He\u2019s sort of translucent. Finn hazards a guess: \u201cAnakin?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYup, well done. Come with me. <em> Now </em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPlease. I need your help.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Words Finn was programmed to respond to:</p>\n<p>Words Finn actually responds to:</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Finn should have gone to wake Rey. He should have gone for Poe, or BB-8, or Chewie -- but there\u2019s desperation crackling around Anakin Skywalker (Anakin Skywalker\u2019s <em> ghost </em> and my aren\u2019t the dead chatty) and there\u2019s pain in his eyes, and it speaks to that deep, glowing part of Finn that the First Order was never able to touch, that nothing\u2019s been able to touch.</p>\n<p>And so he runs, calling out his location to Rey as he does so, knowing -- well, hoping -- that she\u2019ll pick up on it, follow him.</p>\n<p>(He hears Han Solo snap: <em> that\u2019s not how the Force works!) </em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It\u2019s not too long before he finds himself plunging down a sheer icy bank, falling on his arse, snow crumbling under him -- it feels like ten thousand tiny mouths against him, biting and nipping at his bare palms.</p>\n<p>(He was going out for a <em> piss </em> . He\u2019s wearing one of Poe\u2019s old shirts and a bantha-fur coat and unlaced boots. He\u2019s going to die of fucking <em> frostbite </em> because he can\u2019t say no to <em> Darth Vader\u2019s ghost </em>.)</p>\n<p>(And yet. And yet. He\u2019s Finn, and he makes his choice, always makes his choice, and when someone says --</p>\n<p>-- he\u2019s always going to respond because of the aforementioned: he\u2019s <em> Finn </em>.)</p>\n<p>\u201cRight, you need to get him out,\u201d says Anakin, flinging a hand out, indicating a great greyish chunk of ice on which --</p>\n<p>Oh <em> -- </em></p>\n<p><em> You are kidding me </em> , says Rey\u2019s voice, sharp and clear at the back of his head. <em> I\u2019m coming, I\u2019m coming, don\u2019t do anything stupid </em>.</p>\n<p><em> He\u2019s alive</em>, says Luke\u2019s voice, almost marvelling. And then: <em> is that my father? </em></p>\n<p>\u201cStop pestering the boy!\u201d Anakin snaps. \u201cNow, Finn --\u201d</p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t need to complete that sentence. Finn thinks of General Organa, shucks off his coat and boots, and jumps in.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The cold knocks all the sense from his brain -- well, what little sense remained.</p>\n<p>His arms are lead. His legs are lead.</p>\n<p>Inside: that glowing pool of <em> something </em> that the First Order, that the slaughter of Ithaka, that nothing, not revolution or Empire, has ever been able to extinguish.</p>\n<p>Finn Organa pulls Kylo Ren to shore.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou don\u2019t get to die. You don\u2019t, you don\u2019t,\u201d Finn pants.</p>\n<p>The wet crack of breaking ribs under his hands. The <em> one two three </em> he was taught in basic training. Emergency aid. Keep going, keep going.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd let me tell you, my legacy is worthless. My legacy is blood and pain and two children who I should have cared for. My legacy is watching from the shadows as my grandson poisoned himself trying to become me. My legacy is murder and despair and billions upon billions dying for no reason at all,\u201d Anakin shouts in the background. Maybe Kylo can hear him. Maybe he can\u2019t.</p>\n<p>\u201cDid your uncle ever tell you how I died? I died looking on the face of my son for the first time, after saving his life. I died breathing regret. I <em> gave up </em> . Don\u2019t you dare do the same. Don\u2019t you dare be like me. I died. I died, and I had to watch the universe pass by -- I couldn\u2019t influence you, I couldn\u2019t save my children, and I --\u201d His voice catches. \u201cIf you want to make me proud Kylo, then you know what you have to do. You <em> know </em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLive,\u201d says Finn. He forces air down Kylo Ren\u2019s throat. Pumps his chest. Air. \u201cBreathe. Breathe you bastard, breathe for your mother, for me, for the world I want to build, for a world built on novel things like <em> justice </em> and <em> fair trial </em> -- not <em> arbitrary lightsabre death </em> . Breathe because Padme hasn\u2019t forgiven Anakin and might never forgive him because he died before he could fully make amends. Breathe because there are troopers out there who would torture First Order officers to death in my name, because I refuse to build a new world on the blood of the old, breathe -- <em> breathe </em>-- \u201d</p>\n<p>With a hard, coughing splutter -- a spray of red blood -- Kylo Ren does.</p>\n<p>\"I can't feel my legs,\" he manages.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Finn looks.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"No wonder. You don't have any. Well. Uh. They're kind of --\" He tries to think up a nice way to say\u00a0<em>burned beyond all repair\u00a0</em>and fails.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"My arm.\"</p>\n<p>\"Your arm is also gone,\" says Finn, helpfully. \"Leia cut it off.\"</p>\n<p>\"Deserved it,\" manages Kylo Ren. \"I -- I wanted to die.\"</p>\n<p>\"Yeah, well, you don't get to.\"</p>\n<p>\"I've done\u00a0<em>awful</em> things.\"</p>\n<p>\"I know. Mainly to my friends.\"</p>\n<p>\"Don't you want me dead?\"</p>\n<p>\"No. I want you on trial. I want the republic to see that justice touches everyone. Also, and I may be wrong here, but I'm detecting a\u00a0<em>hint</em> of regret.\"</p>\n<p>Kylo Ren glowers.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tries to glower.\u00a0</p>\n<p>His face had frozen itself onto the ice block. When Finn pulled him free --</p>\n<p>Well.\u00a0</p>\n<p>You can imagine.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>By the time the rest arrive, Anakin has gone and Finn has hauled Kylo Ren into something approximating a more comfortable position. The man is leaking blood everywhere, like he's falling apart from the inside out.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Leia freezes. Her face is unreadable. Poe grabs her hand, and she leans against him.</p>\n<p>Rey steps forward, ready to kill; Luke puts a hand on her shoulder, gives the barest shake of his head.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Chewie\u00a0<em>snarls</em>. It's a chainsword sound, the likes of which Finn hopes never to hear again.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\"I'm -- I don't want to -- I'm --\" Kylo Ren manages.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He's leaning on Finn. All Finn need do is step to the side -- the barest fraction of movement, and Kylo would crash into the snow, kowtowing to those he has brought such misery to.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Finn doesn't move. Kylo Ren leans on him all the more and says, in a voice so gargled with blood that it is almost incoherent, \"Lor San Tekka. Jessika Pava. J'Tara Wren. Han Solo. Ben Solo.\"</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Once there was a boy who set himself on fire.</p>\n<p>He lived.</p>\n<p>The hard part comes after.</p>\n<p><br> <br> <br> </p>\n<p>\u201cOnce there was a girl,\u201d says Luke, \u201cand she was beautiful. And there was a boy, and he was young, but old enough -- perhaps -- to know better and --\u201d</p>\n<p>He trails off.</p>\n<p>Rey blinks at him. She inhales with a low, metal rasp.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s telling this story all wrong.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt was eleven years after the Battle of Endor,\u201d he says, instead, \u201cand I was thirty one\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t remember what she called herself. This, he knows, is unforgivable in and of itself -- though, in his defense, she was not forthcoming with her name. She was beautiful, dark spill of hair and bright eyes, and she took him to her bed because his name was Luke Skywalker, because he was a hero, because he was a Jedi Knight -- the first of the last of the Jedi. And he was young, not in years perhaps but in life -- for he was overspilling with hope, giddy with it, singing with it, a new Academy opening up, the possibility of a new Jedi Council looming large -- he had a nephew, a sister, something approximating a family.</p>\n<p>And he had an admirer.</p>\n<p>And was it any wonder he let her take him? She was a little older than himself -- \u00a0he never did find out her exact age -- and, as aforementioned, she was beautiful.</p>\n<p>(Luke has says this three times already. Rey\u2019s hawk-sharp brows have drawn together.)</p>\n<p>(Does she suspect --)</p>\n<p>(He doesn\u2019t have to tell her --)</p>\n<p>(Well. He does.)</p>\n<p>Anyway. He bedded her. He moved on. Han laughed at the story -- farmhand seduced, Jedi Knight corrupted -- and that was that was that.</p>\n<p>Until --</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Rey says.</p>\n<p>Her eyes are bright.

I\u2019m not a Skywalker, my name is Rey Organa, and I have a family and it is --\u201d She hauls in another breath and then coughs, hard, as the apparatus jams up. \u201c<em> Fuck </em> -- I need someone to get a look at this.\u201d It\u2019s sleek, silver chrome, shining bright against her skin. \u201cIt should work damn it, it should work.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cRey -- shall I --\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo!\u201d</p>\n<p>She doesn\u2019t hit him. She doesn\u2019t need to. She flinches away, fast and bitter and shaking, and her cheeks are burned-red, as if scoured by sand, and her fingers flex. \u201cYou left me,\u201d she says, again. \u201cWith --\u201d</p>\n<p>And then: the shove. Her mind against his, demanding, and he opens up for her, permits her to scour through his memories, lets her taste first-hand his guilt, his pain, his undying shame.</p>\n<p>\n<em> I am your father, and I did what I thought was right for you.

Most are too afraid.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPut the gun down, child, and then we may converse like civilised beings.\u201d</p>\n<p>Phasma shows her teeth, but complies.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy are they afraid? We are the New Republic. We are not the First Order.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe New Republic consists entirely of Resistance fighters and one-time troopers. Mainly the latter. Civilians fear you because you are seen to be the sort to -- oh I don\u2019t know -- threaten a being with a gun when he offers you what is considered a very reasonable price?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAn eighty per cent mark-up on songsilk is <em> not </em> reasonable.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI have had to brave the wreckage of the galaxy to bring it to you. There are pirates aplenty, and many difficulties --\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTell me where the pirates are; I will have them executed.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNow,\u201d says Rotta, \u201c<em> that </em> is the sort of talk I can support. Pirates help no one. I would invite you for tea.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo that we may discuss terms.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy not do it here?\u201d</p>\n<p>Rotta blinks. He looks to Phasma\u2019s left, where two dozen armed guards bristle. He looks to her right, where another two dozen grin back.</p>\n<p>\u201cI feel rather uneasy here. It\u2019s a quirk of my species. We dislike guns waved in our faces.\u201d</p>\n<p>Phasma waves her hand. The troops holster their weapons. They are dressed in a mishmash of white beetle-shell armour and olive-green jackets. They could be troopers. They could be Resistance. It is impossible to tell.</p>\n<p>(What no one will ever, ever dispute: they are all soldiers.)</p>\n<p>\u201cYou have fought a war and won it,\u201d says Rotta. \u201cNow, you must succeed in peacetime. Let me tell you this for free, Lady Phasma: winning is easy. Governing is far harder. What do you think of civilians? Truly.\u201d</p>\n<p>Phasma says nothing. Her tightened lips speak volumes.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, there we go. You are a soldier; you are surrounded by soldiers; and yet you must learn to work with those who are not.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cVery well. We will retire to my quarters.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cExcellent.\u201d Rotta undulates after Phasma. \u201cCivilisation can be won with the blaster, but not kept with it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The Hutt brings novelties with him, like a soft-skinned Twi\u2019lek girl who has no discernible purpose other to stand around, look pretty, and occasionally flick one of her long tentacles over her shoulder.</p>\n<p>Two Sevens does not understand.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou cannot fire a blaster?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell,\u201d says she, fluttering her lashes, \u201cNo. But I can use my hands for <em> other things </em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>She lifts the hands in question. They are green. The nails are long and gold.</p>\n<p>\u201cLike medical aid?\u201d says Two Sevens.</p>\n<p>\u201cLike\u2026\u201d The girl blinks a few times. \u201cWhat did you say your name was?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTwo Sevens. And you are?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cJayda. Rott calls me Pumpkin Pie. I\u2019m his bride.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCongratulations.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s away a lot. It does get <em> frightfully </em>lonely.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI am sorry. You accompany him now, though.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI wanted to see what sort of revolution the troopers had organised,\u201d she says. One gold-bright nail trails along Two Sevens\u2019 chest plate. His head quirks on one side. \u201cAll these big, strong soldiers.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p>\n<p>He looks at her finger. She looks at him. Then, with a huff of irritation, she stands up. \u201cI must find my husband.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGood luck,\u201d says Two Sevens.</p>\n<p>Civilians, he decides, are very strange.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the point of her then?\u201d Two Sevens asks Bren. \u201cAll she does is stand around and complain.\u201d</p>\n<p>Bren tells him.</p>\n<p>Two Seven blushes from jaw to brow. \u201c<em> Oh </em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The strangeness of peace, thinks Phasma. There is time for luxury. For clothing of soft pretty fabric, for Twi\u2019lek girls with long nails, for scents and jewellery and good food. She has no taste for it, but many of her troopers do, and soon she finds herself facing up to a trooper named Ceasefire and saying, \u201cYou\u2019re getting fat.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI --\u201d</p>\n<p>He does not look happy.</p>\n<p>(This is an understatement. Phasma may not be Captain Phasma anymore, and she does not shoot people for insubordination, but she is still Phasma, the hard-featured, undisputed leader of the troopers and so, yes, they fear her. As they should. And they love her. As they should.)</p>\n<p>\u201cYou are not the first. You will not be the last. We are soldiers, still. We will always be soldiers.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe war\u2019s done,\u201d says Ceasefire.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes. But we cannot afford to be complacent. The Other New Republic was complacent, and they burned up.\u201d</p>\n<p>(That\u2019s a story there. <em> Once there was a Republic founded on war and they forgot the rules of war, they forgot what had bought them their freedom, and so they burned up. </em>)</p>\n<p>Phasma is not yet accustomed to giving lessons via stories. She says, instead, \u201cLose the weight. I\u2019m starting drills. They are not obligatory.\u201d</p>\n<p>Here\u2019s something the troopers learn quickly: when Phasma says that something <em> is not obligatory </em> it is a good idea to consider it obligatory.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSo, uh,\u201d says Finn, \u201cyou trade all over the galaxy?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat I do,\u201d says Rotta the Hutt. Rotta is a glutinous thing the colour of a fresh bruise. He\u2019s considered a prodigy by Hutt standards; barely seventy years old, slithering along the straight and narrow and (largely) legal path that his darling Daddy never managed to navigate.</p>\n<p>Finn likes him.</p>\n<p>(To be honest, Finn likes everyone.)</p>\n<p>(Almost everyone.)</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd if I gave you something, you could send it off everywhere?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFor the right price.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t have any money.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe price does not need to be in money,\u201d says Rotta. Finn thinks of metal bikinis, chains and flushes all over. Rotta\u2019s laugh sounds like swamp bubbles popping. \u201cNo, not that sort of thing. I deal in the currency of reputation.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUh, okay\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat do you wish to be sent out?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUm. It\u2019s probably easier if I show you\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a painting on the side of the barracks-turned-courthouse.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s Rey.</p>\n<p>She\u2019s caught in the instant before saying something, lips parted, curving up into a smile. Her throat tapers into metal, smooth and gorgeous, and she\u2019s in grey silk Jedi robes, and her lightsabre is green as any meadow.</p>\n<p>\u201cShe\u2019s lovely,\u201d says Rotta. \u201cYou are a lucky man to have her.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI know. But-- look at her. So, when they started painting us we looked like soldiers. And now they\u2019ve started drawing us -- me and Rey and Poe -- like we\u2019re human. We\u2019re smiling. Happy. You know? And that\u2019s how I want the universe to see us. That\u2019s the story I want to be told.\u201d Finn sticks his hands in his pockets, hunches his shoulders. \u201cThe story of us, together, and of the Stormtroopers together -- of FN-2187 who was a Stormtrooper and who made friends and fell in love and, uh, of Stormtroopers who said they weren\u2019t going to kill anymore and of how the First Order actually fell, how it collapsed in on itself, because we stood together and stood as friends and --\u201d Finn trails off.</p>\n<p>Rotta plants a supportive, if slimy, hand on his shoulder.</p>\n<p>\u201cPropaganda,\u201d he says. \u201cIt is a vital part of any society.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe <em> truth </em>,\u201d Finn snaps.</p>\n<p>\u201cA truth,\u201d Rotta comprimises. \u201cI think I can help you with this.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kylo Ren remembers.</p>\n<p>The woman was known as Fulcrum. She was fast, but not fast enough, and fell in two neat halves and as she died --</p>\n<p>\n<em> \u201cNo Snips, no no no, no oh Force -- oh Ben, what have you done --\u201d </em>\n</p>\n<p>Kylo Ren remembers.</p>\n<p>(Ben what\u2019s wrong. Ben what are you doing. Ben why are you locking the doors why are you why are you)</p>\n<p>(<em> Master Skywalker there\u2019s too many of them --) </em></p>\n<p>A choice, always a choice.</p>\n<p>(No please don\u2019t but I must yes I must the draw of the Light is too strong they call me Jedi Killer they call me they call me <em> they call to me </em>)</p>\n<p>(Ben please. Ben please I thought you were my friend Ben please Ben What Are You Doing Ben there\u2019s so much blood Ben why are you doing this please Ben please)</p>\n<p>(My name isn\u2019t Ben.)</p>\n<p>(It\u2019s Kylo.)</p>\n<p>Kylo Ren remembers.</p>\n<p>(I love you. I love you Ben, I love you, I\u2019ll help you)</p>\n<p>(Mummy I had a bad dream.)</p>\n<p>(What was it)</p>\n<p>(About the dark)</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Once there was a boy called Ben Solo.</p>\n<p>He grew up.</p>\n<p>He did not die. He changed. He did not die it would have been easier if he had done because death, at least, is catharsis but he\u2019s not dead, he\u2019s strapped to a medical gurney undergoing surgery on the good ship <em> Solo </em> because Leia refuses to put him on Persephone because if he got loose, if he killed even one of her soldiers, one of her pilots then --</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a file in her hand. The name at the top reads POE DAMERON-ORGANA.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat do we do with him?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPut him on trial, the same as the rest.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s different.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBecause he\u2019s your son?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you really think that little of me, Poe?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo General. No I don\u2019t. I -- he\u2019s killed so many people.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI know. So have I. So have you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>An encounter Poe is trying not to think about:</p>\n<p>\u201cTell us a story, Mister Dameron!\u201d</p>\n<p>He lifts the smaller of the children onto his hip. She clutches at his hair.</p>\n<p>\u201cHow about the Battle of Endor?\u201d</p>\n<p>He tells the story. He makes appropriate sounds, mimicking X Wings and TIE fighters and BB-8 chitters like an Ewok, and at the end he does as his mother used to do, pattering the points of his fingers onto the girl\u2019s head.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd the drums rang out, for the Empire was no more!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut --\u201d The girl\u2019s eyes screw up, in the way of children everywhere when they are thinking terribly hard. \u201cBut what about the troopers?\u201d</p>\n<p>And then Poe remembers. He\u2019s on Persephone. The child in his arms was a Stormtrooper. Her eyes are wide and she doesn\u2019t look excited.</p>\n<p>(They used Stormtrooper helmets as drums.)</p>\n<p>(His mother had told him this as well.)</p>\n<p>(He had giggled in delight at the image.)</p>\n<p>\u201cUh...well,\u201d he says, and shifts the child to the other hip, \u201cmost of them switched sides. To our side. To the good side.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo they didn\u2019t,\u201d says the boy at his feet. \u201cThey were loyalist scum, and they died.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDid they?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThey died, yes. But they weren\u2019t scum. They, uh. They were fighting for what they had been told to fight for. And, later on, \u00a0they would rebel. How about I tell you that story instead?\u201d</p>\n<p>The girl nods enthusiastically, so Poe tells the pair the story of FN-2187 who had been a Stormtrooper. He tells her of how Finn fell in love, of how the rebellion spread through murmurs and stories. He tells them of brave, noble Rey.</p>\n<p>(BB-8 mimics her breathing: that low metal rasp. The girl laughs for joy, and the sullen boy grins.)</p>\n<p>He tells them of the general Leia. He tells them of how Finn liberated troopers from the slave camps in the T\u2019Sara system. He tells them of how you can name yourself whatever you want, and how no one will ever have a number ever again. He tells them all of this, and when he has finished both have forgotten the Battle of Endor. Both are trying -- with limited success -- to make Rey\u2019s breathing noise.</p>\n<p>(Every generation has a story.)</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd when you hear that noise,\u201d says Poe, \u201cI want you to think of Rey. Think of how brave she is, and how good. Think of how she protected her friends, how she got her throat --\u201d he pauses, thinks that <em> throat ripped out </em> is probably the wrong phrasing for children, no matter their origin, and says: \u201c <em> hurt </em> . She did it because she loved her friends, because she wanted to care for them, because she was willing to do anything for them. And that is something we <em> all need to aspire to </em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The girl\u2019s name is Rozetta. She tells the story to her friend Songbird, who tells her teacher Fiver, and Fiver tells Shot-At-Dawn and Shot-At-Dawn tells Reyma Kiltjael. By the time the story has got that far, the impression has improved drastically, and Shot-At-Dawn uses a metal comb and a glass of water to convey it accurately.</p>\n<p>Reyma smiles. She\u2019d testified at Cass\u2019s trial, and she\u2019d sat in at General Asric\u2019s and seen justice done twice over, and this is how the New Republic is built, on trials with evidence and sentences and justice, and the troopers are starting to understand. And Shot-At-Dawn tells her the story of a girl whose heart is ninety per cent of her bodyweight, a girl who you always hear coming, a girl who lived because of the metal in her throat.</p>\n<p>(There are many, many troopers with wounds like that: torn throats and missing limbs and they are alive, they are alive because the Resistance believes in keeping soldiers going even when they can no longer fight -- and so these troopers hear the tale of Rey and to them the sound of her breath is not just the sound of victory but the sound of hope, because she could have died and did not, because they saw fit to keep her alive.)</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Once, Rey was silent. She stole over deserts and between scrap and garbage as shadows do, slipping quicksilver slick into places where no man could follow. Once. And now she isn\u2019t, and now you can hear her coming, always hear her coming, especially when she is upset and weeping and her breathing buzzes like a swarm of wasps caught in a droid.</p>\n<p>Like Vader\u2019s did.</p>\n<p>Correction: like her <em> grandfather\u2019s </em>did.</p>\n<p>Sometimes, there is nothing worse than getting precisely what you wanted.</p>\n<p>Her feet carry her through the camp, through the alleyways and tucked-away places, the hiding places, the places she makes a point to know -- because she was a scavenger, and she lived so long because she knew where to hide where no one could find her. Finally she finds somewhere small and safe and secret, between two weapons dumps, where the air is acrid with the reek of old blaster-fire and there\u2019s blood rusting on the concrete and no one around.</p>\n<p>Luke Skywalker is her father.</p>\n<p>She is a Skywalker.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo I am <em> not </em>. I have a family, I have a family, and it\u2019s not the -- it\u2019s not the ones who left me to rot on Jakku, it\u2019s not, it\u2019s not -- it\u2019s --\u201d</p>\n<p>Her breath catches. <em> Snags </em>.</p>\n<p>\u201cLady Rey?\u201d</p>\n<p>She looks up. There\u2019s a girl. She seems vaguely familiar but Rey\u2019s not Finn, and struggles with all the names. This one is small, and looks frightened.</p>\n<p>\u201cJust Rey. Uh.\u201d</p>\n<p>Her eyes are puffy and red-rimmed and her breathing is <em> hideous </em>. She sounds like she\u2019s gargling with bloody gravel.</p>\n<p>\u201cI -- I\u2019ll go --\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, don\u2019t worry.\u201d The girl, bizarrely, is smiling. \u201cCan you stay? It\u2019s just...it\u2019s nice.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s nice?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHearing your breathing. We never quite get it right.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhen we tell the story -- your story. It\u2019s nice to hear it. It\u2019s comforting. It means hope and\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>And then: \u201cAre you crying? Please don\u2019t cry.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p><br> </p>\n<p>Let me tell you about the Force.</p>\n<p>It eats up its own, Dark or Light, because it is dumb animal hunger and all the humanity of a storm.</p>\n<p>Once, there was a boy. He dedicated himself to the Light. \u00a0He did everything right. He was alone all his long, long life.</p>\n<p><br> <br> </p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Kylo Ren has spent his life not listening to his grandfather.</p>\n<p>The machines whirr and start to sing out alarms as his heart-rate plunges.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou bastard, you live, you live -- you have to live -- you have to face what you\u2019ve done! You don\u2019t get to die, you don\u2019t <em> deserve </em> to die -- you don\u2019t get to, do you hear me?\u201d</p>\n<p>Fortunately, he has picked an excellent time to <em> start </em>.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>If you live long enough, you see the same eyes in different faces.</p>\n<p>This can destroy a man.</p>\n<p>Let me tell you about the Force.</p>\n<p>It is hunger. It is wild. It is bloody mawed fury and it is the gentle touch of a mother\u2019s hand -- it is everything, and in everything, and the only constant is that it eats up those who embrace it, eats them to nothing and licks the bones clean.</p>\n<p>Light or Dark, right or wrong, they all burn up in the end. This is the way of the world, you know.</p>\n<p>This is what it is to be Obi Wan: you have seen the same eyes in different faces too many times. You know that those who set fires are always eaten up by them in the end. You know that things come in cycles, that the past always repeats -- sure as tide on the shore -- you know that the best and bravest man you knew chose to fall to the Dark Side, and you know that his son chose to hide rather than face the pain of his nephews betrayal.</p>\n<p>This is what it is to be Obi Wan: you have forgotten the rest of the story.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Aboard the <em> Solo </em>, Kylo Ren undergoes his fourth surgery.</p>\n<p>\u201cIf I wanted,\u201d says Leia. \u201cI could give him bio-mechanics that didn\u2019t quite fit, that always hurt him, that meant he would never be able to fight again. I could, if I wanted to -- if I ordered it -- ensure that he was always crippled, never a threat. I could have some implants put in that would explode if triggered. I could.\u201d</p>\n<p>Leia looks up at Phasma.</p>\n<p>Phasma says nothing. Instead she reaches out and takes Leia\u2019s hand. Leia hesitates, just for a moment, before squeezing back.</p>\n<p>\u201cI could,\u201d says the General. \u201cAnd I won\u2019t.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s the point,\u201d says Phasma. \u201cYou could be that woman, and you\u2019re not.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Some wars continue. Some end. Three days after the return of Kylo Ren to Persephone, Osma and Snap announce their pending nuptials.</p>\n<p>(That is: they announce them in the morning; by the evening the party is in full swing.)</p>\n<p>(The end of war is a catalyst for all sorts of things. Joy. Pain. And, of course, weddings -- which are both of these)</p>\n<p>\u201cI am not well-trained in interrogation methods,\u201d says Archer, once Colonel Archer of the First Order, named Brendol after the man his father fought alongside, now known to many by the unfortunate nickname of \u2018Our Bastard\u2019 due to his aforementioned lamentable career choice. \u201cBut I will start by removing your genitalia with a hackblade and busk it from there. And then, when you\u2019re a mewling and bloody wreck, I would burn all you love to the ground.\u201d He pauses, then lifts his glass. \u201cBut I am assuming that you will <em> not </em> hurt my Osma, because you will be a worthy husband to her -- I simply wish to illustrate what I, what <em> we </em>, would do to you if you did.\u201d</p>\n<p>Finn\u2019s not been to many weddings -- to any weddings in fact -- but, judging by the strained look on Poe\u2019s face, Best Man\u2019s speeches are not meant to include graphic threats of violence.</p>\n<p>\u201cTo the happy couple! Anyone else?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUh, only one person is meant to speak --\u201d starts Snap, but he\u2019s drowned out by the exuberance of Reyma, Osma\u2019s former squadmate.</p>\n<p>\u201cIf you hurt her,\u201d she says, bouncing to her feet, \u201cI\u2019ll vivisect you.\u201d She\u2019s ruddy-faced and grinning, slopping wine onto her hand as she brandishes her cup in a toast. \u201cTo the happy couple!\u201d</p>\n<p>Shannah Yzetta, not to be outdone, is the next to stand. \u201cIf you ever hurt him,\u201d he trills, \u201cI\u2019ll strap you to the outside of my X Wing and orbit the planet a couple of times until you\u2019re all blown up and dead. To the happy couple!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIs this tradition? The threats?\u201d says Phasma to General Organa.</p>\n<p>\u201cUh. Well. It seems to be now?\u201d says Leia. Kylo Ren is recovering. Soon he will be strong enough to stand trial.</p>\n<p>But now, right now, Poe leaps onto his chair and starts a lengthy discussion of the strange and varied tortures he would subject Osma to in the event of her infidelity.</p>\n<p>Leia has learned to compartmentalise. She was a princess, then a diplomat, then a general.</p>\n<p>Here, there is life. On board <em> Solo </em> is life of another kind. Both hold pain and fire, and both should be valued.</p>\n<p>\u201cI approve,\u201d says Phasma. \u201cIt demonstrates the strength of the bond they have to their squadmates and reassures the couple that they will always be cared for, and that they may have chosen a partner and started a new life but they will not leave the old behind.\u201d She nods once, decisively. \u201cI will not speak, for I am not of her unit, but know that I too would skin alive the pilot known as Snap should he harm my trooper.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd I\u2019d shoot Osma if she hurt Snap.\u201d</p>\n<p>They exchange a brief smile.</p>\n<p>Poe concludes his toast: \u201c...and then they would <em> lick all the honey out of your hair </em> and that would <em> tickle </em>. Enough chatter! Let\u2019s get pissed!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>Finn\u2019s drunk. Well. He thinks he is. He feels all <em> fizzy, </em> warm and bubbly and everything has a slight haze to it. There\u2019s a glass of something blue and glittery in his hand, and Poe is trying to teach Archer to dance which is <em> hilarious </em>because the one-time Colonel has all the agility of a dead plank of wood and Poe --</p>\n<p>Poe --</p>\n<p>Poe is <em> undulating </em> , spinning and grinding his hips in a way that is outright <em> obscene </em>. Finn flushes at the sight, thinks of long nights spent with Poe\u2019s and Rey\u2019s hands on him.</p>\n<p>Archer\u2019s pale face is ruddy-red, and Poe\u2019s got him by the waist, <em> rubbing </em>on him.</p>\n<p>A hot pang of jealousy lances right through Finn. It\u2019s illogical, he knows, but Archer is so <em> pretty </em>, all sharp cheekbones and ghost-grey eyes and the sort of smile that suggests he knows exactly when the world is going to end.</p>\n<p>He downs his drink, and strides over, interrupting Poe mid-thrust.</p>\n<p>Poe immediately slings his arms around Finn\u2019s shoulders and kisses him, hot and hungry and just a little too much for public.</p>\n<p>Archer bursts out laughing. His hair is, as ever, an absolute mess, sticking up in deliberate defiance of the First Order\u2019s protocol. \u201cI\u2019ll leave you ladies to it,\u201d he says, and wanders off to resume his effort to get Shot-At Dawn into his bed.</p>\n<p>\u201cHi,\u201d says Finn, softly, once the kiss is done. Poe smirks at him, stamps a kiss to the corner of his lips. \u201cMissed you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMissed you too,\u201d says Poe. His breath is warm and sweet and this is half of Finn\u2019s victory, right in his arms.</p>\n<p>\u201cLet\u2019s get Rey,\u201d he says. Then: \u201cWhere is she?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>No one dances on Jakku, but Rey is determined not to be left out so she improvises a style best described as \u2018fighting ten thousand enemies at once\u2019.</p>\n<p>Despite her outright hazardous approach to dancing, she\u2019s not lacking for partners. Each one of them wants to listen to her breathe, ear to throat, hands on the sleek metal, and her skin is warm all over, the Force slick and fast over and in her, and she\u2019s Rey Organa who is <em> not </em>a Skywalker.</p>\n<p>Anakin killed children, she knows.</p>\n<p>He <em> killed children </em>. How can anyone forgive him that?</p>\n<p>Once, she thinks, there was a girl and she got what she wanted: a family. And then she got another one, only she didn\u2019t want that one, because she already had one and the other family was bloody and broken and carried with it a hideous legacy and she did not want that. She did not want that at all. She did not want a legacy that was not hers, because she had only just got her <em> own </em> legacy and that was hard enough.</p>\n<p>Here she is: a girl with a heart that could hold the universe, and breath that sings troubled troopers to sleep.</p>\n<p><em> Once there was a man </em> , says a voice in her head, <em> and he made a mistake </em>.</p>\n<p>Then: <em> I am not going to run from this. We need to talk. </em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em> -- </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Once, there was a man. He ran so fast and so far and found himself right back where he started</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m your father. I love you. I failed you, and I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m going to try each and every day to make it up to you. I am never going to leave you again.\u201d</p>\n<p>(Not-leaving: the deepest sign of affection you can give anyone, especially Rey.)</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Leia leaves the celebrations because she must, because she is a mother, because Kylo Ren is her son, was always her son.</p>\n<p>(Once, there was a woman. She saved her children, even though it burned her alive.)</p>\n<p>\u201cI sentence you to exile.\u201d</p>\n<p>No prison can hold him, if he does not wish it to. Besides. Prison is not right for him, this burner of galaxies. This Jedi Killer. This frightened, angry child.</p>\n<p>(Once, there was a man. He saved the life of a great warrior and the great warrior pledged a life debt to him. The man died. The great warrior fulfilled the life debt in another way.)</p>\n<p>(Dying is easy. Living is hard. Fighting a war is easy. Governing is hard.)</p>\n<p><em> \u201cI will take him to Kashyyyk, where he might begin to atone for his crimes.\u201d </em>Chewie claps a great hand to Kylo Ren\u2019s shoulder.</p>\n<p>This is Kylo Ren: more metal than man. His legs are sleek chrome, plated and jointed, flexing perfectly -- covered with cloth you cannot tell that they are false. His face is another matter. It has not healed fully. Bits of it are still wet and red.</p>\n<p>Half of it -- the half that can move -- shapes what could be a smile.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou will not return,\u201d says Leia.</p>\n<p>(It burned her alive --)</p>\n<p>\u201cNot now, and not ever.\u201d</p>\n<p>(--she saved her children.)</p>\n<p>Kylo nods, once, and that is it.</p>\n<p>(Once there was a woman, and she had more children than she ever knew.)</p>\n<p>(She did not fail them.)</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDance with me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI cannot dance.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNot a good enough excuse. Come on.\u201d</p>\n<p>Luke takes Rey\u2019s hand.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you think I have a chance?\u201d says Phasma to Poe. They sit by a great bonfire, flames reaching for the stars, and Poe can still taste Finn on his lips. He\u2019s aching for Finn, for Rey, but Rey is still dancing with Luke and Finn is working his way around the Stormtroopers.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell...a General, and a soldier like me?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em> \u201cI will not call you Ben Solo. You have lost the right to that name.\u201d </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u201cThat isn\u2019t my name anymore.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em> Nor will I call you Kylo Ren.\u201d </em></p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t have a name,\u201d says the man who was once Kylo, was once Ben Solo. He\u2019s not in pain. He should be. He <em> should </em> -- and yet he is not, not in physical pain. He is whole, and he is strong, and his breath sings unhindered out of his lungs and his heart beats on, stubborn and hard, because he is Leia Organa\u2019s son and he wants to live. He wants to live.</p>\n<p>\u201cEveryone needs a name,\u201d says a voice.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a man sitting opposite him. He\u2019s got a scar curved over his left eye. He\u2019s smiling, and it is a kind smile.</p>\n<p>\u201cGrandfather,\u201d says Kylo, almost reverently. \u201cYou\u2019re -- why are you here?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou are my legacy. You take after me more than I like. I\u2019m not going to leave you. I promise.\u201d</p>\n<p>(Not-leaving: an act of affection that Kylo Ren has finally, finally started to appreciate.)</p>\n<p>\u201cI --\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnyway. Names. You need one.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not Ben anymore. I can\u2019t be Kylo Ren.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThink of something.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou tell me.\u201d And then Kylo stops, shakes his head, and corrects himself: \u201cNo. I need to choose, don\u2019t I?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes. You do.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThen call me Ky. It\u2019s close enough. Maybe...maybe one day I can change it to something else. But, right now, I can\u2019t forget Kylo Ren. I can\u2019t forget who I was. I am ashamed of the name, but I cannot forget that I once chose it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGood boy,\u201d says Anakin Skywalker.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>This is what it is to be Obi-Wan.</p>\n<p>There is a choice.</p>\n<p>There is always a choice.</p>\n<p>If Anakin can make his, then so can he.</p>\n<p>Maybe it's time he started to remember the stories.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not crying,\u201d Leia says, dashing tears from her eyes. \u201cI\u2019m not -- \u201c</p>\n<p>Phasma sits beside her. Below, on Persephone, the wedding celebrations continue.</p>\n<p>Now? Phasma sits besides the General, and takes her hand, and she does not leave.</p>\n<p>(Not-leaving: an act that Leia\u2019s life has been sorely lacking in.)</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>A year later, and Finn finds himself in Coruscant, dressed in swooping robes of purple and gold.</p>\n<p>\u201cI still think they\u2019re a little much,\u201d says Rey.</p>\n<p>Padme, translucent but still somehow the most strikingly lovely woman in the room, says, \u201cYou look gorgeous, son-in-law. Hold your head high, don\u2019t stare at one person for too long --\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m married to a Senator,\u201d says Poe. \u201cI\u2019m married to a Senator and a Jedi, I cannot believe this.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhen you live long enough, you see the same eyes in different people,\u201d says Padme. \u201cBut when you live <em> even longer </em> you realise that people can have the same eyes and be utterly different people, because there is <em> always </em> a choice. Now, Finn darling, wear the indigo bantha-leather boots -- the black ones are far too military.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes\u2019m.\u201d</p>\n<p>Finn leaves his (absurdly opulent quarters) into sleek white corridors, only to be ambushed by the slimy embrace of Rotta the Hutt.</p>\n<p>\u201cFinn the Liberator! Finn the Defector! My darling, darling ally --\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFinn Organa-Dameron, actually.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cExcellent, excellent, <em> congratulations </em>-- you are all looking beautiful by the way --\u201d</p>\n<p>Poe and Rey follow. Poe, in his officer\u2019s uniform, olive green and gold; Rey in her grey Jedi silks, her new lightsabre at her hip.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, we know,\u201d says Poe.</p>\n<p>\u201cHere you go,\u201d says Rotta, offering a datapad, showing his latest project. There\u2019s a billboard. It\u2019s bigger than most buildings, towering over the shuttleport, and on it is the latest of Shot-At-Dawn\u2019s artwork: Finn and Rey and Poe, embracing each other, smiling bright and happy, eyes glittering and no weapons in sight. Finn isn\u2019t wearing a shirt; he\u2019s sleek and muscled and defined in a way that is downright <em> obscene. </em></p>\n<p>There\u2019s a caption:</p>\n<p>FINN WANTS <b>YOU </b> TO DONATE <b>TODAY </b>TO THE FUND FOR REFUGEES</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ve raised almost a billion credits,\u201d says Rotta. \u201cAnd they\u2019re all over the galaxy. And there\u2019s a holoplay in production -- and the story is on every datapad in the quadrant.\u201d</p>\n<p>He tugs a slim quadrant out of his velvet coat and offers it. Finn takes it; his eye is drawn at once to the first line:</p>\n<p>\n<em> Once there was a boy. His name was FN-2187 and he was a Stormtrooper\u2026 </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>This is not the end. Stories do not end because life is a story, and life does not neatly tie itself into a bow. People keep living, and there are always battles to be fought, and revolutions always come around again. Light endures not because of one great victory but because of a series of smaller ones, battles fought in private and in the hearts and soul in the people. There will always be another fight.</p>\n<p>But this is <em> an </em> end. And a start.</p>\n<p>Chancellor Leia Organa takes her seat at the head of the New Republic Senate. Phasma, in shining chrome armour, sits behind her, ready to gun down anyone who twitches a muscle wrong. She sees Finn in a train of purple, gold collar and gold torc and purple boots, diamond glittering on his ring finger, looking a little ill-at-ease in all his finery but unable to stop smiling. She sees Poe Organa and thinks</p>\n<p>(she had more children than she ever knew)</p>\n<p>that she will burst from pride.</p>\n<p>She sees Rey, with Luke beside her, who are very much <em> not </em> the last of the Jedi. She sees Reyma Kiltjael, the youngest Senator since Padme Amidala herself; she sees Bren Archer, all decked out in olive green; there\u2019s Shot-At-Dawn, sketching with fast, loose motions of her wrist. There\u2019s Sekhmet, pressed up against Two Sevens\u2019 flank like she never wants to be anywhere else.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s probably the most chaotic Senate she\u2019s ever attended. The delegates share floor-space with those they represent, and everyone clamours for attention.</p>\n<p>(Chewbacca and Ky are such a long way away.)</p>\n<p>(She burned herself alive to save her children, but she survived.)</p>\n<p>\u201cOrder! Order!\u201d she sings out, and the hubbub dies down. \u00a0</p>\n<p>And so it begins.</p>"
