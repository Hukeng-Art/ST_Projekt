  "text": "<p>\u00a0 Jimin is six when his entire pack is killed.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 His family has known the other pack had been after them, but no one realized just how close they actually were. No one realized that when Jimin\u2019s father offended the other alpha by slowly expanding their territory that he\u2019d take it so personally.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 The other pack is much bigger and stronger, and they\u2019d driven Jimin\u2019s family out of their territory in rage. They hadn\u2019t stopped there though, dogging the smaller pack\u2019s steps as they\u2019d fleed for miles, setting up makeshift camps and slowly growing hungry and tired from being on the run so long.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Eventually, though, they were bound to catch up.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 They come in the middle of the night, and Jimin is awoken to the sounds of screaming. He shoots up in his furs at the same moment his mother had come bursting into the tent, eyes wild and frantic.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201cWe have to leave, Jimin-ah,\u201d she gasps, pulling him roughly to his feet as the yells and screams of his pack rise in the air outside the tent. Light flares through the flaps of the tent as smoke begins to rise, and Jimin realizes the camp has been set on fire.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201cEomma?\u201d Jimin asks in fear as he clasps her hand tightly. \u201cWhat\u2019s happening?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 She tugs him to the opposite end of the tent, across from the entrance flaps where the fire is raging outside. Her brown wool gown is torn and dirty as she pulls him into a crouch on the ground.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201cThey found us,\u201d she whispers, looking behind<br>\nthem frantically before she begins to claw at the edge of the tent where it\u2019s been staked into the ground. \u201cI have to get you out of here.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Confused terror swells in Jimin\u2019s chest and he feels tears stinging his eyes. His mother succeeds in ripping the tent away from the ground and pulls it up as far as she could to make room for Jimin. Outside, a rough voice of a man yells, \u201cCheck that tent, I thought I saw someone run in there.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Jimin\u2019s mother\u2019s usually sweet omega scent spikes in acrid fear. She grabs him by the back of his wrinkled tunic and shoves him roughly through the small opening between the tent and the ground. Jimin grunts and scrambles through, mud streaking across his face and clothes.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Once outside, he turns around and reaches for his mother. \u201cCome on, eomma!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 His mother shakes her head roughly. \u201cRun into the woods, Jimin-ah. Keep running and don\u2019t look back.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Jimin\u2019s blood goes cold. He opens his mouth to protest when the flaps of the tent behind his mother are thrown open. She immediately releases her hold on the canvas of the tent and it snaps back into place, cutting off Jimin\u2019s view of her.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 He hears the man yell and his mother\u2019s shrill screams. Jimin claps a small, chubby hand over his mouth to muffle his own screams and stumbles back into the trees. Their makeshift camp had set up on the edge of a forest, and Jimin\u2019s tent had been pitched with it\u2019s back to the treeline.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Everything is on fire, smoking rising to the sky that is filled with horrified screamings, and Jimin wonders what\u2019s happened to his father and the other men. His father, the pack alpha, would surely be fighting for his family against the attackers. Jimin hopes his grandparents are safe, and all his cousins and aunts and uncles.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 He turns and runs deeper into the woods, his little bare feet getting pricked and poked by the rough forest floor as he goes. It\u2019s freezing out and all he has on is his sleep tunic and trousers. He\u2019s panting in a mix of fear and exertion as he runs deeper and deeper into the forest until he\u2019s left the burning campsite far behind and the only noises around him are the swishing of leaves and the hooting of owls.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Jimin doesn\u2019t even realize he\u2019s crying until his face starts to freeze from the wetness. He wipes at his cheeks roughly and finally comes to a slow, shaky stop. Looking around, Jimin spots a wide tree with a hollow at the base of the trunk. He peeks inside, and finding nothing more than rotted leaves, he crawls into the small space that smells of musty wood.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Jimin curls into the fetal position and wraps his arms around his torso. He lets the tears flow freely, his sobs quiet and choked as the realization of all he\u2019s suddenly lost catches up with him. Jimin cries until he has nothing left, and finally drifts into a restless sleep.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Yoongi is eight when some of the men find a small boy abandoned in the forest.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 He\u2019s sitting in the middle of camp next to the cooking fire, helping his girl cousins weave baskets because he\u2019s bored and doesn\u2019t have anything else to do, when two of his uncles and some of his older cousins arrive back in camp, walking in an odd circular formation around something.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201cSend for Hongwon!\u201d One of his uncles yells, and Yoongi perks up at the sound of his father\u2019s name. One of Yoongi\u2019s aunts rushes off to the alpha\u2019s hut to find him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 A moment later, Yoongi\u2019s father, followed closely by his mother, Sunsoo, her belly heavy with child, comes sweeping into the camp clearing. Yoongi\u2019s father is an imposing, stately man with a stern, cool air about him. He shrugs his pelt of bear fur higher up his shoulders and stops before the returning hunters, his black hair gleaming in the sun.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201cWhat is it? What\u2019s happened?\u201d Hongwon asks immediately.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 The hunters part to reveal a young blonde boy, tiny and chubby, covered in dried mud and clad in ripped, dirty clothing. He\u2019s staring around at them with wide, fear filled eyes, and his bottom lip is quivering.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201cWe found him wandering lost and alone by the river,\u201d Ilhoon, one of Yoongi\u2019s uncles says, motioning to the boy.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Yoongi\u2019s mother gasps and drops to her knees in front of the boy. She reaches out and cups a filthy, chubby cheek gently in her hand, and the little child immediately nuzzles into her touch with a small whimper. \u201cOh, you poor baby,\u201d Sunsoo coos, drawing him into a motherly hug.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201cHe was completely alone?\u201d Yoongi\u2019s father asks, looking down at his wife hugging the child with a frown.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Ilhoon nods and gestures behind him at the forest. \u201cHe smells of fire and smoke. Do you remember the smoke we saw rising over the trees four days ago? I think he might have been there.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Sunsoo smoothes the boy\u2019s matted, dirty blonde hair away from his face. \u201cWhat happened to you, little one?\u201d She asks gently.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Yoongi creeps closer and sees that tear tracks mar the mud on his chubby cheeks. He does indeed smell like smoke and fire, tinged with the sour scent of fear and grief, but under that, there\u2019s a milky, baby softness that immediately makes Yoongi feel safe and sleepy.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 The boy\u2019s brown eyes fill with tears and his lip begins trembling again as he looks at Sunsoo. \u201cM\u2019 family was a-attacked,\u201d he whispers hoarsely.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 The rest of the pack, who had gathered around to peer at the stranger curiously, all shift and look around at each other in shock. Hongwon stiffens and exchanges a weary look with the other hunters. Then he looks down and nods at Sunsoo. \u201cTake him to our hut and get him cleaned up and fed.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Sunsoo stands, one hand on her swollen belly and the other reaching down to take the boy\u2019s little hand in her own. \u201cCome with me, sweetling.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 The boy toddles after her, his little legs struggling to keep up with her longer strides. \u201cHyeri,\u201d Sunsoo calls to one of Yoongi\u2019s younger sisters by the fire. \u201cBring a bowl of stew and some bread.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Yoongi follows after his mother and slips inside the alpha\u2019s hut right before the wooden door swings closed behind them. Inside, it\u2019s warm and cozy, with thick, plush furs piled on the floor for his parents and siblings. There\u2019s a table and a few chairs next to the small fire crackling in the roughly built fireplace. There\u2019s a chest of clothing and a few of his father\u2019s weapons hung on the wall.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201cEomma? Can I help?\u201d Yoongi asks, and his mother looks behind her shoulder at him in surprise.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201cOh, Yoongi-yah,\u201d she says, settling the boy down on the warm furs. \u201cSee if you can find some clothes for him. Wonbin\u2019s should fit him.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Yoongi obeys, rifling through the chest to find his younger brother\u2019s clothes. He pulls out a soft wool tunic and brown breeches that look about the same size as the blonde boy. There\u2019s a knock on the door that is probably Hyeri with the food, and his mother leaves for a second to get it. Yoongi slowly approaches the shivering boy and sits down beside him. He holds out the folded clothes to him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201cHello there. I\u2019m Yoongi,\u201d he says, and the boy blinks at him with wide eyes. His full, chubby cheeks are encrusted with dried mud and his eyes are red rimmed from crying. After a long moment, the boy finally accepts the clothes with slow movements.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201cJ-Jimin,\u201d he whispers, his fingers brushing over the soft wool of the tunic.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Yoongi slowly, so as not to spook Jimin, reaches out and places a hand on his shoulder. \u201cYou\u2019re safe now, Jimin.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Jimin gulps thickly and flutters long, pretty lashes at Yoongi uncertainty. Up this close, the scent of his baby softness makes Yoongi melt. \u201cI am?\u201d Jimin asks quietly, shifting a little closer to Yoongi.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Yoongi feels a surge of protection fill him as Jimin peers at him. \u201cI won\u2019t let anyone hurt you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Jimin stares at Yoongi with wide, awe-filled eyes. Sunsoo returns just then, holding a big wooden bowl of steaming venison and vegetable stew and a hunk of fresh bread. She holds the bowl out to Jimin, who finally pulls his gaze away from Yoongi\u2019s and grabs it, devouring the bread immediately.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201cAfter you eat, we\u2019ll get you all cleaned up, okay?\u201d Sunsoo asks, brushing Jimin\u2019s matted blonde hair away from his forehead as he shovels a huge bite of stew into his mouth.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 As he\u2019s eating, Jimin continues to shift closer to Yoongi until they\u2019re shoulder to shoulder. About half-way through, Yoongi\u2019s father enters the hut and kneels before Jimin. \u201cCan you tell me what happened to you, son?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Between his bites of food, Jimin tells them how his father had made another pack angry, that they\u2019d had been on his family\u2019s trail for months, and how they\u2019d constantly been on the move trying to get away from them. They\u2019d finally caught up to them and Jimin\u2019s mother had just barely gotten him out in time. Everything had been set on fire and there\u2019d been so much screaming.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Sunsoo covers her mouth with her hand, and Yoongi presses against Jimin\u2019s side, offering him silent comfort. Jimin looks at him and smiles softly, and Yoongi\u2019s tummy feels all warm.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201cHow many in your pack, Jimin-ah?\u201d Hongwon asks.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Jimin screws up his face as he thinks. \u201cMy parents, my grandparents, two uncles and aunts, and four cousins.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Horror twists Yoongi\u2019s insides. Jimin had lost his entire family in one night.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 It was a relatively small pack, and Yoongi assumes that\u2019s why it was so easy to pick them off. There are over twenty members of Yoongi\u2019s pack, and they would have put up much more of a fight. It sounds like Jimin\u2019s pack was already weakened and tired from running for so long when their pursuers finally caught up with them.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Yoongi turns to his father, eyes pleading. \u201cCan he stay with us?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Hongwon looks at Jimin, who is still scarfing the stew hungrily. \u201cOf course he can.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Later that night, after Jimin has been bathed and dressed in Wonbin\u2019s clothes and fed one more time, he stands awkwardly in the corner of the hut as Yoongi\u2019s family settles down on the furs to sleep. Yoongi\u2019s sisters, Hyeri and Inhee, curl up around their parents, while Wonbin uses Hongwon\u2019s arm as a pillow.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Yoongi crosses over to Jimin and gently takes his little hand. He leads him over to the furs, settling down with Jimin\u2019s back to the wall and Yoongi\u2019s body guarding him from the others, as ridiculous as it sounds, seeing as none of his family is a danger to Jimin.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Yoongi lays down on the soft, warm furs, and after a long moment, Jimin joins him. He curls in close but stops just shy of where they\u2019re touching, and Yoongi doesn\u2019t push it in fear of spooking Jimin.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Soon, Jimin\u2019s breath evens out and his body relaxes. The scent of his sweet softness lulls Yoongi to sleep soon after.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Some time in the night, when the fire is the hut has died out, Yoongi is awoken by the sound of sniffling and soft whimpering. He opens his eyes to see Jimin beside him, still asleep but his face twisted in fear. His body is trembling like a leaf, and a single tear slips past his closed eye and slides down his flushed cheek.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Yoongi reaches out a hand and gently shakes Jimin awake, whispering a soft, \u201cIt\u2019s okay, Jimin-ah,\u201d as Jimin jolts awake.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 The blonde boy stares at him, eyes filled with tears and bottom lip trembling again. Yoongi can\u2019t help himself when he pulls Jimin to him completely and hugs him tight. Jimin immediately burrows his face into Yoongi\u2019s neck and wraps his arms around the older boy, body relaxing at the physical touch.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Yoongi strokes slowly up and down Jimin\u2019s back until his shaking finally subsides and he once again drifts off to sleep, his chubby cheek squished against Yoongi\u2019s collarbones. Yoongi buries his nose in Jimin\u2019s soft blonde hair, washed clean of the mud and smoke and smelling so nice.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0 After that first day, Yoongi and Jimin are inseparable.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Jimin follows Yoongi everywhere, and the older boy shows him all around the camp, introducing him to his pack and taking him to go exploring in the woods.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Jimin, shy at first, begins to slowly warm up to the others, especially Sunsoo and Yoongi\u2019s sisters. The pack, in turn, seems to be enamoured by the chubby blonde boy with blushing cheeks and endearing eye smiles. Yoongi\u2019s elderly grandmother, Kyungmin, seems especially charmed by him. The old woman seems to have developed a fondness for the little blonde boy and likes to slip him pieces of dried fruit whenever her grandchildren aren\u2019t looking.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Not everyone is welcoming of Jimin, though. A couple of Yoongi\u2019s boy cousins seem to view Jimin as an outsider from a rival pack. Yoongi has seen his cousins eyeing Jimin suspiciously the last few days, and has kept a watch on them.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 One day, about a week after Jimin came to them, he and the younger boy are about to go exploring in the woods when a fierce wind picks up and Yoongi sees Jimin shiver. All he\u2019s wearing is a tunic and breeches and a pair of fur boots that used to be Yoongi\u2019s.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201cWait here,\u201d Yoongi says, already turning to jog back to his hut to get Jimin a fur.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 He throws open the trunk and grabs the first fur he sees, a warm and thick pelt belonging to a grey wolf. When Yoongi gets back outside, he sees three of his cousins surrounding Jimin by the trees. Even as he watches, Jongho, whose always been a bully, shoves at Jimin\u2019s shoulders roughly. Jimin lands on his butt on the hard ground with a gasp and stares up at a sneering Jongho with watery eyes.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201cYou\u2019re not welcome here, runt,\u201d Jongho snaps at him, and Yoongi sees red.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 He drops the pelt and charges headfirst at Jongho with a snarling growl. He leaps at his cousin and tackles him to the ground, straddling him as he begins raining his fists down on the older boy\u2019s face. Jongho is yelling, trying to push him off as Yoongi is growls furiously. He can feel hands scrabbling at his back and shoulders as his other cousins try to pull him off, but he shoves them away.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201cWhat\u2019s going on here?!\u201d Comes a cry, and they all look up to see Jongho\u2019s mother running up to them.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Yoongi finally climbs off of a battered and bruised Jongho, glaring daggers at him when he groans in pain. Yoongi looks at his aunt and points to Jimin, who is still on the ground and has been watching the fight in shock.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201cJongho was bullying Jimin,\u201d Yoongi says, walking over to crouch on the ground next to the blonde boy. He reaches out and pushes Jimin\u2019s hair away from his face, and the younger sniffles and leans into his touch. \u201cHe pushed him over and called him names.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Yoongi\u2019s aunt looks at Jongho sharply. \u201cIs that true?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Jongho stands up shakily, cradling his arm and nursing a black eye. He glowers at the ground, silent, but it\u2019s enough of an answer for his mother. She growls and grabs him roughly by the ear, making him yelp in pain as she begins pulling him away.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201cJust wait until your father hears about this,\u201d she\u2019s telling him as they stomp off. She looks behind her shoulder and jerks her head roughly to Yoongi\u2019s other cousins. \u201cDon\u2019t think I haven\u2019t forgotten about you two. Get over here.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Heads bowed in defeat, they scurry after their mother, casting Yoongi and Jimin guilty looks behind them as they go. Once they\u2019re out of sight, Yoongi cups Jimin\u2019s chubby cheeks in his hands and brushes a stray tear that\u2019s fallen away with his thumb.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201cAre you okay, Jiminie?\u201d Yoongi asks him gently, leaning in to peck a tiny kiss on the tip of his nose. It earns a watery giggle as Jimin nods. He allows Yoongi to pull him to his feet, and he retrieves the abandoned pelt and drapes it over Jimin\u2019s little shoulders. It makes him look likes he\u2019s swimming in grey fur and its adorable.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201cDo you still want me to show you the poppy field, or do you want to go home instead?\u201d Yoongi asks him, worried that Jongho and the others had spoiled the mood.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Jimin quickly shakes his head though and takes Yoongi\u2019s hand. \u201cI want to see.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Yoongi grins at him and leads him into the forest in the direction of the hidden poppy field he\u2019d discovered last summer. No one else knows about it, and he\u2019s excited that he gets to share it with Jimin.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 They trek through the woods hand-in-hand, stopping occasionally to drink some of the water Yoongi had packed. Yoongi shows Jimin which berries growing in the forest are safe to eat, and they snack on blueberries and blackberries as they go. By the time they reach the field, their hands and lips are stained purple.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 When they step out into circular opening ringed by trees on all sides, Jimin gasps. The field is not overly large, but still big enough to fit a few small tents inside. The green of the soft, tall grass is almost completely hidden by the masses of bright red poppies swaying in the breeze. Everywhere Yoongi looks, the pretty flowers dot the field in masses, their sweet, alluring scent filling the air. The sun shines down on the clearing and turns the poppies a brilliant fire red, the black centers of the flowers winking out at them like a thousand little faces.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Jimin giggles and runs into the field, his chubby fingers skimming gently over the petals. He turns to Yoongi and grins happily. \u201cIt\u2019s so pretty!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Yoongi melts a little at seeing Jimin so happy and carefree. He runs after Jimin and follows him into the middle of the clearing, where Jimin gets down in the flowers and lays on his back. Yoongi joins him and they spend a while gazing at the fluffy white clouds drifting through the blue sky overhead. Yoongi and Jimin link hands again and burrow deeper into their furs when a cold winds pick up a little. Even though the sky is clear and bright, winter is approaching and the days are quickly turning colder.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 After a long time, Jimin turns his head to the side to look at Yoongi. \u201cHyung, are we friends?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Yoongi squeezes his hand tight and smiles at him. \u201cThe very best. Forever and ever.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Jimin is eight when Yoongi moves from his parents\u2019 hut to join his other boy cousins in the communal hut they share until they present as either an alpha, beta, or omega. Jimin is loathe to be seperated from Yoongi at night, so even though he\u2019s technically too young to be away from adults, they allow him to move in with Yoongi.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Jongho and the other boys are annoyed at this and shoot Jimin glares and biting words, but with Yoongi protecting him he finds he doesn\u2019t care. They take up a small corner of the hut, with Jimin\u2019s back always against the wall and Yoongi\u2019s body as a buffer between him and his cousins. They cuddle under the furs, wrapped together in familiar warmth. Yoongi\u2019s scent, like the woods and clove, has become the smell of home to Jimin.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 During the days, the men of the pack take Yoongi, Jongho, and the others boys out in the forest to teach them how to hunt. Jimin is too young so he stays back with the women and girl children. Sunsoo, who smells like milk and roses and warmth, teaches him how to skin a hare for the stew. Wonbin is sitting with them, dutifully stirring the stew with a long wooden ladle.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201cLike this, eomma?\u201d Jimin asks, trying to copy her motions with a skinning knife.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Sunsoo smiles at him and nods, continuing to work on her own hare. \u201cVery good, Jimin-ah.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Hyeri walks up to them then, carrying a plump baby in her arms. \u201cJiwoo is awake,\u201d she says, presenting the babbling baby to Sunsoo, who quickly wipes her hands on her woolen dress and takes her newest son into her arms. The baby coos happily and grabs a fistful of Sunsoo\u2019s long, raven-colored hair in his chubby fist.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 She sits back down on one of the logs surrounding the cooking fire and nods at Jimin to keep skinning. They continue for a while until four year old Inhee and one of Yoongi\u2019s older girl cousins comes running up to them. \u201cEomma, look!\u201d Inhee exclaims, holding out her hands to show four small, off-white eggs.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Sunsoo frowns at her youngest daughter. \u201cWhere did you find those?\u201d She asks, and Inhee smiles guiltily and shrugs. Sunsoo\u2019s mouth tightens. \u201cDid you go out in the woods alone?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Inhee shakes her head and nudges the cousin. \u201cSoonyoung was with me!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Sunsoo glares at Soonyoung, a pretty girl of eleven. \u201cYou should know better than to let her go out in the woods, Soon-ah. You should\u2019ve waited for Yoongi to come back, then he could\u2019ve gone with you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Soonyoung blushes and looks rightly reprimanded. \u201cSorry, auntie,\u201d she mutters, looking down at the ground. Wonbin sniggers and Jimin slaps him on the arm with a glare.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201cOw, hyung!\u201d Wonbin whines at him, but Jimin ignores him and goes back to skinning.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Later that afternoon, Hyeri, Inhee, and Soonyoung teach Jimin how to make flower crowns. They gather up half a dozen bouquets of flowers from around the clearing and spread them all out in the middle of the camp. \u201cHere, Jiminie, add some lilacs to yours,\u201d Hyeri says, handing Jimin a handful of the flowers. \u201cThe purple will look pretty with your blonde hair.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 At one point, Wonbin comes up to them and tries to stomp on their flowers with an annoying laugh. \u201cFlower crowns are for babies,\u201d he crows at them, and Inhee, his twin, growls in anger and pushes him over onto the ground. Wonbin squawks when Inhee jumps on him and starts slapping at his face.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 The twins tussle on the ground for a few moments until Hyeri gets annoyed and yells at them to stop. \u201cI\u2019m going to tell eomma you won\u2019t leave us alone!\u201d Hyeri warns him as Inhee rolls off him with a huff. Wonbin glares at his older sister before stomping away angrily.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Soonyoung rolls her eyes and continues weaving a daisy into her crown. \u201cBoys.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Dust is beginning to fall when the hunters return, dragging a large buck with them. Jimin is sitting with Yoongi\u2019s grandmother as she works on tanning a fresh hide. She\u2019s telling him stories of her youth and keeps reaching into her pocket to slip Jimin some sweet blackberries. Every time she does, Jimin smiles sweetly as her and pops the berry into his mouth.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201cAigoo, how can someone be so precious?\u201d The old woman mutters, reaching down to caress his plump cheek lovingly. He still has the flower crown he\u2019d made with the girls on his head, even though some of the flowers are starting to wilt.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Yoongi enters the camp with a bow slung over one shoulder and a dead hare clutched in his other hand. Jimin looks to grandmother for permission, who smiles softly at him and nods. \u201cGo on,\u201d she says, and Jimin gets up and runs up to Yoongi, his flower crown balanced atop his head.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201cDid you catch that yourself?\u201d Jimin asks in excitement, pointing at the hare. Yoongi smiles triumphantly and leans in close to Jimin so only he can hear.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201cJongho didn\u2019t catch anything. He\u2019s terrible with a bow and arrow. His father got mad at him because he kept missing.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Jimin covers his mouth to stifle his giggles when Jongho pushes past them with a thunderous frown on his face. Yoongi\u2019s eyes flick up to the clower crown on Jimin\u2019s head and he smiles. \u201cThat\u2019s pretty. Did you make it?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Jimin nods and reaches up to feel the woven flowers. \u201cI could make you one if you want.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Yoongi smiles warmly at him and takes his hand as they walk over to the fire to deposit Yoongi\u2019s catch. \u201cI\u2019d love that, Jiminie.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Yoongi is ten when he and Jimin sit in their secret poppy field as Jimin teaches him how to weave crown out of the bright flowers. Jimin chatters as they work, his little fingers deftly working the stems together while Yoongi struggles to make his look as good as Jimin\u2019s. Jimin giggles at his attempts before he sets his crown aside and takes Yoongi\u2019s from him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201cLike this, hyung,\u201d Jimin says, showing him with slow movements how to weave the stems together.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 The warm spring sun is shining down on them and the birds are singing. Yoongi pokes at the cute baby fat of Jimin\u2019s tummy, which makes him squeal and drop the flower crown. \u201cHyung!\u201d He whines, slapping Yoongi\u2019s hand away.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Yoongi dives in again and places his hands on the sides of Jimin\u2019s face, squishing on his fat cheeks and making his lips pout out. \u201cAigooo, so cute,\u201d Yoongi coos at him in an imitation of his grandmother, squeezing his cheeks a few times and grinning fondly at him. He leans his face in and rubs his nose against Jimin\u2019s, making baby noises through his smile.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Jimin shrieks in anger and shoves Yoongi away, his cheeks turning red both from the abuse and embarrassment. Yoongi laughs and pinches Jimin\u2019s plump cheek again, and he growls in annoyance and pushes his hand away again. \u201cHyung, focus! I\u2019m trying to teach you how to do this.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201cOkay, okay,\u201d Yoongi grins, holding his hands up in surrender. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Jimin slants Yoongi a suspicious look before he picks up their fallen flower crowns and starts up where they left off, cheeks burning bright red.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Jimin is ten when he and Yoongi sit at the bank of the river under the cool shade of the trees.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Yoongi has his trousers rolled up and his legs in the water, and Jimin is cross-legged behind him as he picks twigs and leaves out of Yoongi\u2019s mussed up black hair. He and Jongho has gotten in another fight when earlier, Jongho has purposefully knocked into Jimin\u2019s shoulder as he\u2019d passed, making the younger boy spill the firewood he\u2019d been carrying all over the ground. Yoongi has growled in outrage and tackled Jongho onto the grass, raining punches down on this face.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Sunsoo had broken up the fight and sent Yoongi and Jongho in opposite directions to cool off. A pissed off and dirty Yoongi has taken Jimin by the hand and marched them into the woods.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Now Jimin is picking the debris out of Yoongi\u2019s raven hair from the fight. Yoongi is still grumbling to himself in anger, so Jimin plucks out the last twig from his hair and scratches up and down Yoongi\u2019s back a few times to calm him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201cI wish you\u2019d stop fighting with him,\u201d Jimin says, making Yoongi huff and cross his arms petulantly.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019ll stop fighting with him when he stops bullying you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Jimin feels warm at Yoongi\u2019s words, and he wraps his arms around his best friend\u2019s shoulders in a hug.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Then he pushes Yoongi into the river and laughs at the girly scream he lets out.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Yoongi\u2019s sopping wet head breaks the surface of the running water and he sucks in a spluttering gasp. \u201cYah!\u201d He yells, glaring at Jimin as he treads water. \u201cYou little brat!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Jimin giggles gleefully and scrambles to his feet to make a break for it when Yoongi lunges at him through the water. He\u2019s not quick enough though, because Yoongi leaps up and grabs Jimin around the waist, pulling them both back into the river with a mighty tug.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Cold water engulfs Jimin\u2019s entire body and he screeches as soon as his head breaks the water. \u201cHyung!\u201d He yells in outrage, splashing water at a laughing Yoongi swimming beside him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201cYou started it!\u201d Yoongi exclaims, splashing him right back.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Jimin tries to dunk his head under the water but Yoongi swims away. They play around in the river for a while longer until the sun disappears behind the clouds and they start to get cold.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 By the time they arrive back at camp, they are dripping wet and shivering violently. Sunsoo takes one look at them and clucks her tongue disapprovingly. She tells them to sit in front of the fire and fetches dry clothes for them. Once they are dressed again, they huddle together in front of the fire under a large, warm fur. Jimin rests his head on Yoongi\u2019s shoulder, loving the warmth he radiates. They stay like this until the dinner preparations begin and the women drag in a giant boar to begin roasting.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 They go to bed with full bellies and content hearts, cuddled together in their corner of the boys\u2019 hut.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Yoongi is twelve when his parents finally let him and some of the older children make a trip to the nearby beach by themselves. Jimin, Hyeri, Soonyoung, Jongho, and a few other cousins set out in the morning with sacks packed full of picnic supplies packed by their mothers. Wonbin, Inhee, and the younger children had thrown a mighty tantrum at not being allowed to go, but Hongwon had been stern in telling them that they were too young to be out without any adults.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 On the trek through the forest to the beach, Yoongi and Jimin bring up the rear of the group, holding hands as they walk with their arms swinging. Jongho makes it very obvious that he\u2019s the leader of this expedition, and usually that would make Yoongi seethe. It\u2019s pretty much a given that both Yoongi and Jongho will eventually present as alphas, and they\u2019ve always had a rivalry because of it. Right now though, Yoongi couldn\u2019t care less, more than content to fall behind in Jimin\u2019s company and let Jongho take the lead.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 It\u2019s a hot, sunny day, and the shade of the trees offers some much needed relief. It\u2019s about a two hour walk to the beach, and Yoongi and Jimin picks berries and snack on them as they trudge after the others.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Eventually, the hard packed earth of the forest floor begins to turn sandy, and they step out of the trees onto a small sandy cove. The rolling blue water of the ocean slurps up onto the wet sand before it recedes again, the sun glinting off the surface like glass. Seagulls caw overhead and the air smells salty and briny, and the cool breeze coming off the water is refreshing and pleasant on Yoongi\u2019s hot face.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Jimin gasps at the sight before him and goes pelting across the hot, white sand towards the water. He\u2019s never seen the ocean before, and the childlike wonder on his face is the best thing Yoongi\u2019s ever seen. He kicks of his leather sandals and steps into the water as it laps back up the sand. The sun shines down on his blonde hair and turns it a brilliant gold as the sea air ruffles the soft strands. He looks like a shining angel and it's beautiful. Yoongi drops his sack and toes of his own sandals before running after Jimin.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201cHyung, it\u2019s incredible!\u201d Jimin laughs as he turns to look at Yoongi, the soft sea spray misting across their faces.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201cIt\u2019s just water,\u201d Jongho bites from behind them, but they both pointedly ignore him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 They both shuck off their lightweight cotton tunics and toss them onto the sand before wading into the cold water. Jimin keeps making cute gasping sounds the further up the the water laps against his porky belly.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 They wade out until their shoulders are submerged and their feet are barely brushing the sandy, rocky ocean floor. They are pulled gently to and fro by the soft current of the sea, and it makes Yoongi feel utterly weightless. Jimin squeals when seaweed brushes against his leg and Yoongi laughs at the look on his face. In revenge, Jimin splashes at him and Yoongi gets a mouthful of salty water.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Hyeri swims out to them a little while later while the other children remain closer to the shore, tossing a carved wooden ball between each other and laughing loudly. They stay out in the water until their fingers turn into prunes and their limbs begin to get sore from wading. Yoongi\u2019s stomach growls loudly and he decides it's time for lunch.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Jimin and Hyeri swim after him and they all stagger onto shore on shaky legs. Yoongi and Hyeri unfold the large quilt their mother had packed them and lay it down in the sand. The other kids, seeing them unpacking lunch, get out of the water to join them. Once they\u2019re all seated on the quilt, dripping water and tired, food gets passed around. Hunks of smoked deer and slabs of dried fish leather and fresh bread. There\u2019s nut and berries and carrots that are grown in the camp. Everyone gulps down mouthfuls of water as the hot sun dries their skin and makes them sleepy and content. They joke and laugh with each other, and even Jongho seems to be more agreeable than usual.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 When lunch is finished, Jimin, Hyeri, and Sooyoung begin making a sandcastle, while Yoongi, Jongho, and the others spread out to search for shells and interesting findings across the beach. Always keeping Jimin in the corner of his eye, Yoongi searches the shore for anything pretty. He finds two delicate turritella shells, one multiple shades of brown and the other a light pink. He finds a pure white scallop the size of an an ear, a long, smooth auger, and a couple of little cowrie shells buried in the sand. He finds a handful of abalones, their beautiful colors shining in the sun. He also finds a hag stone, a small oval rock worn smooth by the sea with a single hole going completely through the middle. Hag stones are a gift from the sea goddess and are thought to bring good luck.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Searching through a small tide pool, Yoongi pulls out a big grey clam the size of his hand. He tries to pry it open but it won\u2019t give, so he takes to smashing it against the rocks until it finally cracks open. Inside sits a single, perfect pearl, mostly round and just a little oval. It\u2019s iridescent baby pink and mint green that glints in the sun. Yoongi plucks it carefully from the clamshell and tucks all his findings safely in his pockets. He wants to show Jimin, but something tells him to wait for a special occasion.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 After awhile they all converge back into the water when the sun gets too hot. They swim around for a few more hours until they all grow too tired and decide to call it a day. They repack their supplies and set off home, letting the sun and the warm air dry their clothes. Once again, Yoongi and Jimin fall behind the others, holding hands as they walk. Jimin has turned a few shades darker under the sun but poor Yoongi is a brilliant shade of sunburnt red, and he knows he\u2019s going to be sore for the next couple of days.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201cThat was really fun, hyung,\u201d Jimin smiles at Yoongi sleepily, a flush high on his cheeks from the sun. \u201cCan we come back again soon?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201cOf course we can,\u201d Yoongi squeezes Jimin\u2019s small hand. The blonde boy grins at him sweetly and Yoongi feels warmth spreading through his chest.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Jimin is twelve when Jongho presents as an alpha.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 The usual age for presenting is between the ages of fourteen and eighteen, and Jongho had been sixteen for about a month before he presented. The pack had celebrated with a fantastic feast, music and dancing. Most every member of the pack presents as betas, so it\u2019s always joyous when any of the young presents as both alphas and omegas.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 The day after the celebration, the mood in camp is somber. Jongho stands with his parents at the edge of the camp, dressed in layers of warm clothes and a big leather sack across his back.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 When a young man, or woman, though it\u2019s incredibly rare, presents as an alpha, they have to go through a sort of coming of age ritual to prove their worth to their pack as an alpha.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 A year alone, in the wild, away from their family, relying on only themselves and their skills to survive.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 The pack has gathered with a heavy heart to see Jongho off, and Hongwon, as the alpha of the pack, places a hand on his nephew\u2019s shoulder. \u201cGood luck,\u201d he says solemnly. \u201cWe\u2019ll be waiting for your return.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Jongho nods and takes a deep breath, casting his parents one last look before he turns and disappears into the forest.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 They won\u2019t see him again for an entire year.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Yoongi is fourteen when Soonyoung presents as an omega, just three months after her brother, Jongho, left on his Solitude. There is another grand celebration, even more joyous because they know Soonyoung doesn\u2019t have to go away.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Unlike when alphas present, omegas don\u2019t have to do anything special. But word will spread quickly through the land of the new omega, and alphas will start arriving from near and far to try to court her.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 The first one arrives a week after Soonyoung\u2019s first heat, which she\u2019d spent in the solitary heat hut a mile away from camp. When she comes back home, she seems brighter, happier, more sure of herself. Yoongi, who hasn't presented yet and still has the nose of a beta, can\u2019t smell any difference, but he knows that her scent must have changed; become sweeter, more enticing.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 They are gathered around the fire for breakfast when one of Yoongi\u2019s uncles catches the scent of a stranger. An alpha. They are all immediately on alert, forming a protective ring around Soonyoung.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 The alpha steps out from the trees, hands raised in an non threatening manner. He looks to be in his early 20s, tall and dark haired with a defined body and sharp jawline.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 He introduces himself as Joonjin of the Na pack, who reside far across the valley. As he introduces himself, his eyes keep catching on Soonyoung, who is watching him with narrowed eyes behind her mother\u2019s shoulder.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Hongwon allows Joonjin to meet with Soonyoung, but only with a chaperone. Joonjin leads Soonyoung away from the camp, followed closely by Ilhoon, one of Yoongi\u2019s uncles and also a beta.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201cI don\u2019t like the look of him,\u201d Jimin whispers to Yoongi as they add vegetables to the cooking pot for tonight\u2019s dinner.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Yoongi nods and glances off in the direction they had disappeared. He also doesn\u2019t like the feeling of this Joonjin, and he doesn\u2019t like him being with Soonyoung. But Ilhoon, a strong hunter, won\u2019t let anything happen while he\u2019s around.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201cSoonyoung is smart. She won\u2019t go for someone who shows off by flexing his big muscles,\u201d Yoongi assures Jimin, who still looks a little concerned.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 They return to camp a little while later, Soonyoung with a tight look on her face and Joonjin looking annoyingly triumphant. Hongwon, as pack alpha, is obligated to ask him to stay for dinner.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 All day Joonjin goes around camp telling everyone who will listen about all his accomplishments and achievements as an alpha, chest puffed out in pride. Yoongi can tell he rubs most everyone the wrong way, and the sound of his constant crowing is grating on Yoongi\u2019s nerves.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 By the time dinner rolls around, the whole pack is irritated and annoyed. Joonjin doesn\u2019t seem to get the memo because he just keeps bragging about his victories.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Eating is a quiet affair save for Joonjin, who is unfortunately sitting next to a seething Soonyoung, who is subtly leaning away from him with a pinched look on her face.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Blessedly, dinner finally ends and Joonjin draws Soonyoung to the edge of camp, with Ilhoon keeping watch close by. Yoongi and Jimin don\u2019t even try to hide their staring this time as Joonjin hands something to Soonyoung. She looks down at it for a moment before shaking her head and saying something they can\u2019t hear. Then she turns her back on him and strides back into camp.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Joonjin\u2019s face drops and he turns around abruptly and stomps away without another word. Ilhoon drifts back into camp and smiles when he sees the confused looks on Yoongi and Jimin\u2019s faces.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201cThat was what it looks like when an alpha gets rejected,\u201d he tells them.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Yoongi sniggers and Jimin slaps him on the shoulder before anyone hears him. They get up and race after Soonyoung, catching her just before she enters her hut.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201cNoona, what did he try to give you?\u201d Jimin asks curiously, and Soonyoung scowls.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201cIt was a courting gift,\u201d she says, crossing her arms in annoyance. \u201cA pinecone.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201cA pinecone?\u201d Yoongi tries to hold back his laughter.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201cApparently it\u2019s from some special tree that grows by his pack\u2019s camp,\u201d Soonyoung rolls her eyes. \u201cIf I had accepted it, it meant I would\u2019ve accepted his attempts to court me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019m glad you didn\u2019t accept,\u201d Jimin says, and Soonyoung smiles and ruffles his blonde waves.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201cMe too, Jiminie.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Jimin is thirteen when Jongho returns from his Solitude.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Now seventeen, Jongho seems to have grown up. There\u2019s a mature, relaxed ease about him, his facial features have sharpened and defined, and he\u2019s taller and more toned now. The biggest surprise comes when Jongho sees Yoongi again for the first time and he pulls him into a brotherly hug. The two have always been rivals so to see Jongho showing genuine affection for Yoongi has the whole pack shocked.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 He regales the pack about all his adventures during his Solitude, how he had to hunt and forage for food, how he\u2019d had to fight off a lone beta who he discovered sniffing around his makeshift camp, and how he\u2019d almost fallen over the side of a cliff one night.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Jimin finds the stories fun, but he finds the way that Yoongi is absentmindedly playing with the younger\u2019s fingers much more interesting. Lately Jimin\u2019s been noticing things about his best friend. Like the way his black hair gleams almost blue under the sunlight, like a raven\u2019s wings. And the way his eyes are always droopy with sleep but always seem to light up when he sees Jimin. Or how long and slim his fingers are and how nicely they fit with Jimin\u2019s when they hold hands.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Yoongi brushes his thumb along Jimin\u2019s knuckles, the light touch raising goosebumps on his skin. Yoongi is listening to Jongho\u2019s story with an unconscious frown on his pouty lips, but Jimin finds himself glancing up at Yoongi\u2019s face every few seconds. When Yoongi finally notices, he looks at Jimin curiously, brows raised.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d He whispers, and Jimin\u2019s cheeks heat up at being caught. He quickly drops his gaze to their joined hands and shrugs.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201cNothing,\u201d he breathes back, squeaking in surprise when Yoongi wraps an arm around Jimin\u2019s waist and pulls him snug against his body. It takes a few moments but Jimin finally relaxes and lays his head on Yoongi\u2019s shoulder, sighing in contentment. Yoongi\u2019s warmth and scent are home to him now, and Jimin barely remember his life before he joined the pack and met Yoongi.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Unknown to the two of them, the other members of the pack are sneaking glances at them and smiling at each other knowingly.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Yoongi is fifteen when he gives Jimin the first gift.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 It\u2019s just a single poppy, picked from their special field, but Yoongi feels like it's a meaningful gift. He finds Jimin in the woods by the camp foraging for firewood, his blonde hair glinting in the light spilling through the trees.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Hiding the flower behind his back, Yoongi approaches Jimin, who looks up at him and grins happily when he sees the older boy. \u201cHyung!\u201d He chirps, setting down his stack of firewood. \u201cDid you come to help me?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201cSure,\u201d Yoongi says. \u201cBut first I wanted to give you this.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 He holds the flower out to Jimin, watching his face closely for his reaction. Jimin\u2019s eyes light up when he sees the poppy and a smile stretches across his face. \u201cFor me?\u201d He asks, looking at Yoongi, who nods. Yoongi holds his breath as Jimin reaches out for it. He plucks it from Yoongi\u2019s fingers and holds it to his nose to smell it. \u201cThank you, hyung!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Yoongi sags in relief. Jimin may not know what the flower signifies, but Yoongi sure does. And the fact that Jimin accepted it makes Yoongi\u2019s instincts howl in satisfaction and happiness. Jimin tucks the flower into the leather belt cinched around his tunic and picks the firewood back up.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201cShould I have gotten you a present too?\u201d Jimin asks as he straightens back up, and Yoongi blushes.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201cNo,\u201d the older boy replies. \u201cYou don\u2019t ever have to give me gifts.\u201d Jimin looks a little confused but Yoongi bends down and quickly begins gathering up firewood before he can ask any questions.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 They forage around for a little longer until both of their arms are full of firewood. They head back to camp and deposit their haul by the cooking fire, where Sunsoo and Hyeri are skinning a couple hares for supper. They just narrowly escape being roped into helping, and they both go racing off to join Inhee and Wonbin where they are tossing a wooden ball at each other and hitting it with a roughly carved bat.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 After dinner, Yoongi and Jimin curl up in their corner of the boy\u2019s hut. While he was away, a private hut had been built for Jongho, so he no longer lives with them. Jimin places the poppy Yoongi gave him between two flat slats of chopped wood and hides it under one of the furs in the corner.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Yoongi asks him curiously.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019m pressing it so I can keep it forever,\u201d Jimin replies, finishing his task and laying down next to Yoongi on their pile of furs. He squirms into Yoongi\u2019s space, and the older boy wraps his arms around Jimin and hugs him close. Yoongi\u2019s chest fills with warmth at Jimin\u2019s words and he leans in and kisses the top of Jimin\u2019s fair head.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Yoongi drifts off to sleep to the sound of Jimin\u2019s gentle breaths and his soft, comforting scent.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Jimin is fourteen when Yoongi presents as an alpha.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 One morning they wake up and Yoongi\u2019s smells a little different, even to Jimin\u2019s muted senses. A little muskier and darker. Yoongi is groggy, rubbing his head and wincing when he moves. When they step outside, Soonyoung is the first to smell him with her sensitive omega nose.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201cYoongi-yah!\u201d She gapes at him. \u201cYou presented!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 That quickly draws the others, and Hongwon clasps his son on the shoulders and stares at him intently. \u201cAn alpha,\u201d he finally smiles, and the pack cheers. Sunsoo rushes up and suffocates Yoongi in a hug, her eyes twinkling with tears of joy.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Everyone had known Yoongi would present as an alpha, being the firstborn son of the pack alpha, it was almost guaranteed. He will most likely succeed Hongwon as pack alpha eventually.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 In the back of his head, Jimin had sort of known this. But now, as the pack celebrates and congratulates a shocked Yoongi, it hits him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Yoongi will have to leave for a whole year.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Jimin\u2019s stomach drops into his feet and he feels like a bucket of ice water has been dumped over his head. He tries not to let it show on his face because he doesn\u2019t want to ruin Yoongi\u2019s moment, but inside his chest, he can feel his heart shattering.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Yoongi must be able to sense it or notice the change in Jimin\u2019s scent with his new alpha nose, because he looks over at him sharply from where Ilhoon has him in a friendly headlock. Jimin tries to smile at him reassuringly, but it\u2019s stiff and awkward and he knows it doesn\u2019t reach his eyes.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 It\u2019s quite a while later before Yoongi can finally break away from his family as they rush around to prepare a celebration feast. Jimin is hiding in the forest by himself, sitting on a fallen tree trunk and feeling miserable.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Yoongi, like he always has, finds him easily. Yoongi kneels in front of Jimin and cups his face in his hands, looking worried. \u201cWhat it it, Jiminie?\u201d Yoongi asks softly, and the tears that Jimin\u2019s been holding back finally flow.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201cY-you have to leave now,\u201d he blubbers miserably, nuzzling into Yoongi\u2019s touch. Yoongi coos gently and pulls Jimin into a tight hug against his chest.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019ll be back before you know it,\u201d Yoongi says, rubbing Jimin\u2019s back soothingly as Jimin cries into his neck.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201cA year is so long,\u201d Jimin sniffles, holding tight to his best friend. \u201cI\u2019ll miss you so, so much.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019ll miss you more,\u201d Yoongi murmurs, his fingers twisting in Jimin\u2019s blonde waves. \u201cMore than you know.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Jimin sobs again and squeezes Yoongi even harder. \u201cWhat am I going to do without you? Who will protect me?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Jimin doesn\u2019t know if he imagines it when Yoongi growls lowly. \u201cJongho and the others don\u2019t bother you anymore, so you don\u2019t have to worry about them, okay?\u201d Yoongi says, his thumb brushing along Jimin\u2019s ear. \u201cAnd you can stick with Hyeri and Inhee and help eomma around camp, alright? And you and Wonbin can make sure no stupid alphas try to come court Soonyoung who aren\u2019t worthy of her. You can play with Jiwoo and keep halmeoni company. You know how much she loves you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Yoongi words work to calm Jimin down a little, and he wonders when Yoongi\u2019s voice had started getting deeper. Jimin nods minutely into Yoongi\u2019s shoulder, taking a few deep breaths to calm himself. \u201cYou won\u2019t forget about me, right?\u201d Jimin asks meekly, and Yoongi squeezes him tight.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201cAs long as you don\u2019t forget about me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Jimin weekly slaps at Yoongi\u2019s arm. \u201cI would never forget you, stupid.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Jimin can almost feel Yoongi\u2019s smile. \u201cWell then, there\u2019s your answer.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Jimin lets out a watery giggle despite himself. God, he\u2019s going to miss Yoongi so much. They\u2019ve never spent a single day apart in the last eight years, and Jimin doesn\u2019t know how he\u2019s going to be able to be without Yoongi.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 They stay out in the woods together until the sky darkens and the smell of roasting meat reaches them. Soonyoung comes to find them a short time later to announce its time for the celebration.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Holding hands as if its each of their lifelines, Yoongi and Jimin reluctantly return to camp. The celebration kicks off immediately. There\u2019s food and drink and laughter and storytelling. Soonyoung plays a lively tune on her lute and a few of the cousins join in with deerskin drums. The little kids of the pack dance around and squeal with laughter, and Hyeri and Inhee place a beautiful handmade lei of flowers around Yoongi\u2019s neck as the guest of honor.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 The atmosphere is lively and energetic, but both Jimin and Yoongi are quiet and solemn. They cling together the entire night, and Jimin swears on more than one occasion that Yoongi subtly scents him. He wonders if he smells any different to the alpha\u2019s new nose.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 By the time the celebration dies down, Jimin is exhausted, but he doesn\u2019t want the night to end, because when the morning comes, Yoongi will have to leave.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Instead of going to sleep in their hut, Yoongi suggests that they take a small tent and camp in their poppy field for the night. Jimin eagerly accepts, and awhile later they lie in the middle of their field, sheltered by a small leather tent pitched up by wooden rods.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 They are lying cocooned in piles of soft, warm furs, wrapped around each other as they listen to the crickets chirping outside.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201cI don\u2019t want you to go,\u201d Jimin murmurs into Yoongi\u2019s neck as the new alpha strokes his blonde hair.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201cI don\u2019t want to go either,\u201d Yoongi replies softly, fiddling with Jimin\u2019s earlobe. \u201cI don\u2019t want to leave you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201cYou don\u2019t have to,\u201d Jimin sniffles, though he knows it\u2019s in vain.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Yoongi flicks his ear gently. \u201cYou know I do.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Jimin huffs and snuggles closer to Yoongi. They lie like this for a few more moments until Yoongi shifts. \u201cI almost forgot,\u201d he says, pulling away from Jimin to dig into the small leather satchel he\u2019d brought with him. He pulls something out and presents it to Jimin. \u201cFor you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 It\u2019s a river stone, perfectly round and pure white. It\u2019s smooth to the touch and is about the size of a robin\u2019s egg. Jimin takes it reverently and strokes his thumb over the smooth, cold surface.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Jimin looks up to see Yoongi watching him closely. \u201cIt\u2019s beautiful,\u201d Jimin whispers. \u201cI love it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Yoongi smiles at Jimin, the breathtaking one that shows all his gums, and Jimin feels his heart stutter in his chest.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 A swell of jittery courage overtakes Jimin and he gulps thickly. \u201cC-can I give you a present too?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Yoongi frowns at him. \u201cJiminie, I said you never have to giv-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Jimin cuts him off by leaning in and kissing him. It\u2019s just a quick little peck, barely any pressure and over in half a second, but it still serves in making Jimin\u2019s heart explode and his chest feel hot.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Yoongi stares at Jimin with wide eyes, mouth slightly agape, and when he doesn\u2019t say anything for a few beats, Jimin starts to fear he\u2019d done something wrong.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201cW-was that okay?\u201d He stutters, his blood running cold in mortification.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Yoongi finally reacts. He blinks a few times before pulling Jimin into a tight hug. \u201cOf course it was, sweetling,\u201d Yoongi whispers into his hair, and Jimin relaxes, heart swelling at the term of endearment.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019ll think about you every moment,\u201d Yoongi tells him as exhaustion begins to creep over Jimin. He just barely manages to hold back a whimper, nuzzling his face deeper into Yoongi\u2019s neck instead.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 They both drift to sleep wrapped up in each other, with the scent of poppies around them.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0 The next morning, the mood is somber as Yoongi and Jimin head back to camp so Yoongi can gather his things.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 The pack all gather around Yoongi as he stands in the middle of the camp, a huge sack of supplies across his back and his warmest and most durable clothes on. Sunsoo tearily kisses him goodbye and his younger siblings crowd in for a group hug. His grandmother waddles up and wraps a wool scarf tightly around his neck before clapping him fondly on the cheek.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Hongwon, never one to show much affection, pulls Yoongi into a tight embrace and whispers something that only he can hear. When they pull away, Yoongi is blinking away tears, and Jimin wants nothing more than to kiss them away.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Finally, it\u2019s Jimin\u2019s turn to say goodbye. He approaches Yoongi slowly, not willing to let him go but knowing he has to. Yoongi holds out his arms and Jimin jumps into them with a muffled whimper. The two hug tightly, desperately, as if their lives depend on it.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019ll see you soon, Jiminie,\u201d Yoongi breathes, and Jimin feels tears sting his eyes.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201cYou better,\u201d he sniffles back, voice watery. Yoongi kisses his forehead gently and finally pulls back, though it\u2019s slow and reluctant.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Yoongi takes a few steps backwards before, with one final look at Jimin, he turns and disappears into the forest.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0 The first few weeks without Yoongi are torture for Jimin.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 He didn\u2019t realize how accustomed be was to Yoongi\u2019s presence, to their constant cuddles and touching and closeness, but now that he\u2019s devoid of it, Jimin feels like he\u2019s slowly crumbling away. He goes about his days as if he were dead, feeling empty and lost.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Finally, Yoongi\u2019s grandmother gets tired of his moping and calls him into her hut. She sits him down and stabs a hooked finger at his chest, eyes narrowed in a glare. \u201cDo you really think this is what Yoongi wants?\u201d She asks sternly. \u201cFor you to be this miserable without him? He\u2019d be so upset if he knew how sad you were because of him.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Jimin stares at her with wide, shocked eyes. He\u2019d never thought about it like that. It\u2019s true, Yoongi would be horrified to see how lifeless Jimin has become in his absence, and that thought makes Jimin cringe. \u201cI-I\u2019m sorry, I-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201cDon\u2019t apologize,\u201d halmeoni interrupts firmly. \u201cJust start being happy and living your life again the way Yoongi would want.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Jimin gulps heavily and feels the sting of tears in his eyes. After a long, silent moment, he finally nods. \u201cOkay,\u201d he whispers, slipping his hand into his tunic pocket to close his fist around the river stone Yoongi gave him, which he always keeps with him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Halmeoni grunts and nods approvingly, reaching out to pinch Jimin\u2019s fat cheek. She sends Jimin on his way after slipping him a piece of his favorite dried caribou meat, which he hides so the other grandchildren don\u2019t see.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 The men of the pack have started building Yoongi\u2019s hut for when he returns. All alphas get their own hut to cut down on territorial issues, while betas all tend to stay together, or with their mates and families. Unmates omegas room together as well, as apparently they get a sense of safety in numbers. Jongho had been built a hut while he was away, while Soonyoung had moved into the omega hut with a few of the of the unmated omegas of the pack.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Recently, Jongho has been venturing away from camp in search of a mate. This time, he\u2019s already been gone for five days, and they have no idea how much longer it could be. They\u2019re all hoping that he\u2019ll return with a nice omega male or female and settle down to have some pups.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Likewise, more and more alpha males have arrived to try to court Soonyoung, all big and buff and arrogant, but she continuously turns them all down. Her parents are beginning to get frustrated with her, but when asked why she keeps rejecting them, she simply states that they weren\u2019t \u2018the one\u2019.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Over the next few months, Jimin spends a lot of time running around and frolicking with Hyeri, Wonbin, Inhee, and little Jiwoo. They chase each other through the forest and dare each other to see who can climb the highest tree. In the summer, they take another trip to the beach, since Wonbin and Inhee are old enough to go now, although Jiwoo has to stay home.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 They spend the day baking in the sun and swimming in the ocean, splashing water at each other and searching for shells. Jimin can\u2019t wait until they can all come back again when Yoongi returns.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Eventually, as time goes on, Jimin begins to notice that his baby fat is slowly melting away. He still has full cheeks and a little soft belly, but he slims down in other places, like his hips and waist and jawline. He likes the way that his body feels now; more refreshed and energetic.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Sunsoo teaches Jimin to milk the single cow they keep tethered in a grassy field right by the camp, shows him how to sheer their few sheep to turn their wool into clothing, and how to gather eggs from their chickens without pissing off the rooster.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 While life is good, Jimin still desperately misses Yoongi, and counts each day that passes in anticipation for his return. If he\u2019s missing Yoongi extra bad, he\u2019ll secretly sneak off to their poppy field, where it feels like Jimin is surrounded by Yoongi\u2019s presence. It makes the longing a little more bearable and he\u2019ll stay there for hours. He hopes his best friend is safe and warm and is taking care of himself. Jimin promises himself that he\u2019s going to give Yoongi the biggest hug in history when he sees him again.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0 The Solitude isn\u2019t so hard, Yoongi has come to learn. It\u2019s pretty simple; hunt, sleep, bathe in rivers, keep a fire going. In all honesty, it\u2019s actually pretty boring. All his life, Yoongi has been surrounded by his pack, never alone for more than a few hours, and he misses it. He can\u2019t wait to go back home and be around his family again.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 To pass the time, Yoongi makes things for Jimin. He wittles him a little wooden wolf figurine out of wood, collects pretty stones and delicate broken egg shells. He skins the pelt of a small bear he\u2019d killed and tans the hide, turning it into a warm fur and sewing two leather straps across the chest to be worn. It gleams bright black in the sunlight, and even though it's hot out, Yoongi takes to wearing it so that when he give sit to Jimin, it\u2019ll be soaked in his scent.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Yoongi finds a hunk of solid amber wedged into a nook in a pine tree, with a huge mosquito encased perfectly inside. Here and there he comes across beautiful feathers lying abandoned on the forest floor or stuck in the underbrush, so Yoongi carefully plucks them up and tucks them away safely.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 His greatest gift though, Yoongi will save for the very last.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 He takes all the seashells he\u2019d collected that day at the beach and carves tiny holes into them. He strings them all onto a thin leather cord and even carves a few wooden beads to add on as well. In the very middle, Yoongi strings the pearl he\u2019d found in the clamshell, and it glints in the sun, beautiful in the very center of the delicate necklace.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Yoongi can\u2019t wait to give Jimin all his treasures, and his heartbeat quickens at the thought of his little blonde Jimin, with his plump, rosy cheeks and his breathtaking eye smile and the little chipped front tooth he\u2019d gotten when he\u2019d tripped over a log a few years ago.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Warm with the thought of Jimin, Yoongi tucks away the presents and crawls into his small tent to get some sleep, counting down the days until he\u2019ll get to see his baby again.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Jimin is fifteen when he presents as an omega.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 It starts off slow, with Jimin just feeling hotter and more sluggish than usual. His skin is clammy to the touch and there\u2019s a thin sheen of sweat glistening on his forehead.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 It\u2019s Jongho who notices first. Jimin is helping Sunsoo gut some fish, feeling a little warm and heavy, when Jongho is passing by and freezes. He sniffs the air a few time until his eyes widen and he stares at Jimin.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201cJimin-ah\u2026\u201d he begins slowly before tapering off, and Jimin is confused when pink blooms on Jongho\u2019s cheeks. The older man looks at Sunsoo for help. \u201cUh...I think Jimin-ah...presented.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Sunsoo does a double take at Jimin, her eyebrows shooting up. Then she leans in close and sniffs at Jimin\u2019s neck, which makes Jimin squirm a little. She blinks a few times as realization dawns on her face. \u201cI didn\u2019t even notice,\u201d she whispers. \u201cIt\u2019s hard for omegas to smell other omegas.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Jimin gapes at his mother. \u201cO-omega?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 She smiles reassuringly and ruffles his blonde hair. \u201cCongratulations, baby.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Jongho is staring at him intently and Jimin\u2019s body suddenly feels extra hot. \u201cW-what do I do?\u201d Jimin gulps, looking at Sunsoo nervously. She quickly wipes off her hands and leads Jimin away from prying ears.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201cYour first heat will hit any day,\u201d she tells him in a low voice. \u201cWe\u2019ll set you up in the heat hut and we\u2019ll send an omega to bring you food and water.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Fear overtakes Jimin and he cowers into himself. \u201cHow long will it last?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Sunsoo smooths over his cheek with the clean part of the back of her hand. \u201cThree to four days,\u201d she replies. \u201cIt\u2019ll be intense, Jimin-ah, and you won\u2019t have anyone to help you.\u201d Jimin holds back a whimper and nods miserably.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 He listens to Sunsoo tell him about what to expect during his first heat, and already Jimin is feeling a little hotter and feverish. By the end of the day, he is sweating profusely and rubbing at his tightly uncomfortable skin.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 His heat hits two days later, and Sunsoo escorts him to the heat hut about a mile away from camp. It's horrible, he\u2019s burning up from the inside out and everything is on fire. Every touch against his skin makes him whimper in pain because he\u2019s so sensitive, like a whip lashing against him, and a few hours into his heat he\u2019s ready to claw his skin off.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Sunsoo warned him about the slick, but it didn\u2019t prepare Jimin for how <em>much</em> there\u2019d be. It leaks out of him like a waterfall, hot and wet and a little slimy. His whole body aches for something to fill him and he\u2019s hard, so hard it physically hurts. It\u2019s pure torture and he spends a long time crying into his pillow, wishing for death to come for him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 When the ache becomes too much, Jimin acts on instinct and uses his fingers. It\u2019s instant relief, and he cries with how good it feels. He wants more though, something bigger and longer that\u2019ll fill him up and put out the fire under his skin.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Eventually, Jimin is able to get himself off enough that there\u2019s a temporary lull in his frantic desire, and he\u2019s able to fall into a fitful sleep. Sunsoo and Soonyoung take turns leaving food and drink outside the door, which Jimin will drag himself over to and force himself to consume to keep his strength up.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 It goes like this for the next four days, and by the time the heat under his skin finally fades away, Jimin is utterly spent and exhausted. Sunsoo comes to collect him, petting his hair and telling him how good he did, and he cries into her shoulder for awhile.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 When he comes back, they move him to the omega hut, since it's not safe for Jimin, who is unmated, to be around alphas, and even some betas, now. He shares the hut with Soonyoung, Hami, one of Yoongi\u2019s unmated aunts, Winwoo, a male cousin, and Jinae, an old spinster who never had the desire to take a mate.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Before he moves out of his old hut, Jimin retrieves the dried poppy flower Yoongi had given him from where he\u2019d hidden it in their corner. He tucks it away safely in his new hut, which smells like overly sweet omega.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 It\u2019s true that once you present, the senses become enhanced. Suddenly, Jimin can smell everything, and it takes him a little while to get used to the overwhelming sensation. He learns to pick out the different scents of the pack members.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Sunsoo smells like warmth and roses and motherly love, a scent that has always been there but is much more amplified now. Hyeri smells like the sea and growing leaves. Wonbin and Inhee smell like the dirt they like to wrestle in and the bruises they give each other. Hongwon smells like the pack alpha; hard and stoic and like the woodsy aroma of the forest.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Lately, Jimin has noticed that Jongho is paying special attention to him. He always seems to be watching the omega, and he\u2019s started being nicer than usual. He\u2019d offered to help Jimin with skinning last week\u2019s hares and had even let Jimin cut in line to get dinner last night.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Jongho smells like an alpha too. Heady and sort of musky, but there\u2019s a sharp pine sap scent to him that Jimin can\u2019t quite find pleasant.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 It\u2019s on one fall day when Jimin is bringing an armful of firewood into camp that Jongho finds him and pulls him aside. The older, taller boy seems nervous as he plays with something behind his back. His cheeks are flushed and he can\u2019t quite meet Jimin\u2019s eyes.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201cWhat is it, Jongho-ah?\u201d Jimin asks curiously, setting down the firewood. Jongho seems to take a deep breath and finally holds something out to Jimin.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 It\u2019s a leather cord with a carved wooden bead tied in the center. Jimin stares at it in confusion before looking back up at Jongho, who is watching him nervously. Courting gifts, Soonyoung had explained to him shortly after he presented. If an alpha wants to court you, he\u2019ll try to present you with gifts. If you accept the gift, it means you are accepting the alpha\u2019s advances.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 It was when she said that that Jimin had realized in shock that Yoongi has given him gifts. But surely they hadn\u2019t been courting gifts. It was before Jimin had even presented, and it\u2019s mostly unheard of to try to court an unpresented individual. So Jimin had chalked it up to his best friend simply being nice and giving him a few gifts.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Jongho clears his throat uncomfortably and Jimin startles. He realizes he must have been staring off into space while thinking about Yoongi. Jimin looks from Jongho to the gift, and deep down he knows he can\u2019t accept Jongho\u2019s advances. It doesn\u2019t feel right.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201cUh, I\u2019m really flattered, Jongho-ah,\u201d Jimin begins hesitantly. \u201cBut, um...I don\u2019t think I can accept.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Jongho\u2019s face falls and Jimin feels a surge of guilt. \u201cIs it because of Yoongi?\u201d The older boy asks gruffly.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201cOf course not,\u201d Jimin says quickly. <em>But is it?</em> \u201cI just...don\u2019t think we would be very compatible.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201cWhy not?\u201d Jongho frowns.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \"<em>Well, you used to bully me and push me down and constantly get into fights with Yoongi because of me,</em>\u2019 Jimin thinks. \u201cWe\u2019re just too different,\u201d he says instead.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Jongho grits his teeth and Jimin watches as he seems to struggle with some sort of inner monologue. Finally, and to Jimin\u2019s surprise, Jongho finally looks at him and nods slowly. \u201cVery well,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ll respect your wishes.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Then he walks away, tucking the gift into his pocket. Jimin watches him go in confusion, when Soonyoung suddenly slithers up to him. \u201cDid my brother just try to court you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Jimin blinks at her a few times. \u201cI think so,\u201d he finally says, not really believing it himself.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Soonyoung slaps a hand over her mouth to hide her snickers. \u201cOh my god, I can\u2019t believe it,\u201d she giggles, looking at Jimin in awe. \u201cAnd I can\u2019t believe you rejected him!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Soonyoung pats Jimin on the back with a laugh before she wanders away, leaving Jimin to wonder what just happened. He hurries to go find Sunsoo and tell her what happened, and his mother tries to hide a smile when he tells her how he said no to Jongho.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019m proud of you,\u201d she says, brushing Jimin\u2019s hair away from his face. \u201cDon\u2019t ever feel like you have to settle with just any alpha.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Feeling better after their talk, Jimin goes to sleep that night dreaming of Yoongi.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0 Yoongi is seventeen when he finally returns to his family.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 It\u2019s a cool fall day when he steps out of the trees and into the camp clearing, and immediately, the scents of his pack and childhood overwhelm him. A sense of safety and belonging that he\u2019s been missing for a year settles in his chest, and Yoongi knows that he\u2019s home.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Inhee is the first to see him. She screams loudly and drops her half-woven basket, running across the camp and into Yoongi\u2019s arms. The commotion attracts the attention of the rest of the pack, and soon Yoongi is surrounded by his family and their welcoming hugs and kisses. Sunsoo is crying when she finally releases Yoongi from a crushing hug, and Hongwon claps him on the back proudly.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201cCongratulations,\u201d he tells his firstborn. \u201cYou\u2019ve proven yourself as an alpha.\u201d Then the two share a hug and Yoongi can\u2019t help but feel proud of himself.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 There\u2019s one person Yoongi is looking for who is very obviously not amongst the welcoming party. The one person Yoongi is truly dying to see. Sunsoo must see Yoongi\u2019s gaze flitting around because she whispers so only he can hear, \u201cJimin went off into the forest a little while ago.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Yoongi smiles at her gratefully and drops his bag where he stands, too excited to see Jimin to properly put his things away. He heads back into the forest at random, since his mother didn\u2019t say where in the woods Jimin had gone. But Yoongi has a feeling he knows.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 The closer he gets to the poppy field, the more excitement bubbles under his skin. Finally, he steps out into the rolling red field, and there he is.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Jimin is sitting in the grass with his back to Yoongi, the blonde of his hair shining in the sunlight beaming down on him. He\u2019s humming quietly to himself, and the sound makes Yoongi positively melt.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201cJiminie,\u201d Yoongi says quietly, and Jimin spins around, eyes wide and mouth open in a silent gasp.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 That\u2019s when Yoongi smells him. So, so fucking sweet, like honey and maple and a hint of orangey citrus. Underneath is his usual baby softness, and the combination almost makes Yoongi black out. It\u2019s mouthwatering, and Yoongi realizes with a jolt that Jimin must have presented as an omega while he was gone.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201cH-hyung?\u201d Jimin whispers, climbing unsteadily to his feet. \u201cIs it really you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Jimin\u2019s omega scent fills Yoongi\u2019s nose, and he can even taste it in his mouth. He swallows the heavenly flavor down and nods, staring at Jimin in a sort of drunken awe. Jimin lets out a sort of sob, and before Yoongi\u2019s knows it, Jimin flings himself into his arms and almost chokes the breath out of Yoongi.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Yoongi hugs Jimin back for dear life, burying his nose in his neck to inhale that intoxicating scent while sparks explode under his skin. \u201cI\u2019ve missed you so much,\u201d Yoongi whispers as Jimin clings desperately to him. He cups the back of Jimin\u2019s head, the other wrapping tight around his slim waist. \u201cSo, so much.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Jimin is sniffling into Yoongi\u2019s shoulder, his hands grasping everywhere at Yoongi, as if he thinks if he stops touching him, he\u2019ll disappear again. \u201cI\u2019ve been so lost without you, hyung,\u201d Jimin gasps. \u201cSometimes it felt like you were never coming back.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Yoongi squeezes Jimin impossibly tighter, a growl wanting to rumble in his throat. \u201cBut I\u2019m back now,\u201d he says, stroking Jimin\u2019s golden locks. \u201cAnd I\u2019m never leaving you again.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201cPromise?\u201d Jimin mumbles, voice watery with emotion.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Yoongi finally pulls away a little and cups Jimin\u2019s jaw with both hands. \u201cI promise,\u201d he says, smoothing his thumbs over Jimin\u2019s cheekbones.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 He leans in and kisses the very tip of Jimin\u2019s little button nose, then between his eyebrows. He wants to kiss Jimin\u2019s beautiful plump lips, but instead he just rests their foreheads together. Jimin sighs happily and his eyes flutter closed as they lean into each other.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 After awhile, Yoongi pulls back to take Jimin in. He realizes in surprise that Jimin has lost some of his adorable baby fat. He\u2019s slimmer now in some areas that used to be cute and chubby.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201cWhere\u2019s all my fat?\u201d Yoongi asks, blinking at Jimin. He reaches up and squishes Jimin\u2019s cheeks out. \u201cThese are still the same, but where\u2019s my other adorable fat?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Jimin whines and shakes Yoongi\u2019s hands off, his abused cheeks going pink in embarrassment. \u201cHyung,\u201d he mutters, flushing even harder when Yoongi pats around his waist and tummy, eyes wide in awe.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201cWhere\u2019d the squish go?\u201d He asks, genuinely confused. Jimin squawks loudly when Yoongi suddenly pulls his tunic up to reveal his belly, not so chubby as before, but still soft and a little pouchy. Yoongi coos and rubs as Jimin\u2019s little tummy, which makes Jimin squeal in outrage, face blinding red.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201cHyung!\u201d Jimin cries, slapping Yoongi\u2019s hands away and tugging his tunic back down.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Yoongi just chuckles at his cuteness and leans in to plant a quick kiss on one of his hot cheeks. \u201cYou look so pretty,\u201d he says softly, and Jimin squeaks, burying his face in Yoongi\u2019s neck in embarrassment. Yoongi wraps him up in another tight hug, his inner alpha growling happily at the fact that Jimin will smell strongly of him now.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 They hug for a long time, the poppies swaying in the breeze around them and the chirping of birds in the air. With Jimin in his arms, Yoongi knows he\u2019s finally home. When Jimin starts to nuzzle his face into Yoongi\u2019s neck, unconsciously scenting him, the older boy gulps while his inner alpha howls in approval.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201cHave you always smelled so good, hyung?\u201d Jimin murmurs against Yoongi\u2019s skin, and he shivers.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Yoongi strokes Jimin\u2019s soft hair, trying not to let the feeling of Jimin scenting him get him worked up. \u201cU-uh...I think it\u2019s because you presented as an omega,\u201d Yoongi says, throat dry.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Jimin tenses up a little in his arms. \u201cDoes...does that mean I smell good to you too?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Yoongi swallows thickly. \u201cMmm-hmm,\u201d he hums, sounding a little strangled.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Jimin reluctantly peels away from Yoongi. \u201cSorry. This is probably weird, right?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Yoongi brushes Jimin\u2019s bangs away from his face. \u201cI don\u2019t want anything to change between us.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Jimin smiles in relief at him and nods. \u201cMe neither.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201cOh,\u201d Yoongi says, reaching into the pocket of his tunic. \u201cI have something for you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 He holds out the wolf figurine he\u2019d carved out of wood to Jimin, whose lips part in a silent \u2018O\u2019. Jimin looks between the wolf and Yoongi a few times, and there\u2019s something different in his eyes compared to the other times Yoongi\u2019d given him courting gifts: understanding.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Jimin now seems to understand the significance and meaning of what Yoongi is giving him, and the older boy holds his breath in nervous anticipation. Will Jimin truly accept his feelings, now that he knows what it means?</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Jimin blinks a few times before he finally reaches out and reverently takes the wolf from Yoongi\u2019s hand. Relief and happiness and pride fill Yoongi and he lets out a breath he didn\u2019t know he was holding. Jimin holds the wolf to his chest and strokes his thumb over the dark, gleaming head. \u201cIt\u2019s stunning,\u201d Jimin whispers, looking back up at Yoongi with awe in his eyes. \u201cThank you, hyung. I love it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Yoongi grins at him, his chest blooming in warmth. Jimin has knowingly accepted his courting as an alpha, which is all Yoongi has ever wanted.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Then Jimin takes him completely by surprise and rises up on his tiptoes to press his lips lightly to the side of Yoongi\u2019s mouth, just barely on his lips.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Heat explodes through Yoongi\u2019s body and his heart skyrockets in his chest. He stares at Jimin with wide eyes when he steps back, both of their cheeks bright pink. \u201cCome on,\u201d Jimin says, looking down shyly. \u201cThe pack will want to have a feast to celebrate your return.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Jimin takes his hand and they twine their fingers together. \u201cThey also built you your own hut,\u201d Jimin tells him as he leads him out of their poppy field.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Yoongi realizes with a jolt that he and Jimin won\u2019t be able to sleep together anymore. Yoongi will have his own hut and Jimin will have moved to the unmated omegas\u2019 hut. Though Yoongi plans on changing that soon.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 The thought hurts. They\u2019ve already been separated a year, and now they can\u2019t even go back to cuddling at night? Yoongi tries not to let his sadness show on his face.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Yoongi holds onto Jimin\u2019s hand tightly as they walk, and Jimin chatters happily about all he\u2019s missed. Apparently Soonyoung still hasn\u2019t accepted any alphas\u2019 advances, Hyeri shows signs of presenting as a beta, and Jongho attempted to court Jimin.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Yoongi stops dead in his tracks, yanking a surprised Jimin to a halt as well. \u201cJongho did...<em>what?</em>\u201d He says slowly, feeling his blood begin to boil.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201cIt\u2019s okay, hyung, I didn\u2019t accept,\u201d Jimin explains quickly, sensing Yoongi\u2019s anger and noticing the way his scent is spiking in aggression. \u201cI didn\u2019t accept his advances.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Yoongi takes a moment to take a deep breath, trying to calm himself. It\u2019s okay, Jimin rejected Jongho. There\u2019s no need for him to get so worked up over it. Yoongi breaths in and out a few times, the alpha inside him trying to claw its way out in rage.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Jimin says miserably. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to upset you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Finally snapping out of it, Yoongi growls and pulls Jimin into a tight hug. \u201cDon\u2019t apologize, sweetling. It\u2019s not your fault Jongho tried to court you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Jimin relaxes into his arms and nuzzles his face under Yoongi\u2019s chin, purring softly. God, Yoongi could stay like this for eternity with Jimin, his Jimin, warm and soft and smelling so sweet, wrapped up in his arms where Yoongi can keep him safe forever.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 When they finally separate, Jimin is blushing again, so he quickly weaves their fingers back together and continues pulling Yoongi along. As they walk, a questions nags at Yoongi\u2019s until he finally gives in and asks. \u201cWhy <em>did</em> you reject him?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Jimin looks at him quickly, cheeks darkening again. It\u2019s silent for a moment as they crunch along the fallen leaves of the forest floor. \u201cBecause he\u2019s not you,\u201d Jimin finally says in a quiet voice, glancing up at Yoongi\u2019s shyly.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Oh. <em>Oh.</em> Yoongi gulps heavily, feeling heat rise in his cheeks and his heart soar in his chest. Is Jimin saying what he thinks he\u2019s saying? Yoongi smiles softly and squeezes Jimin\u2019s hand tighter, trying to silently tell him what Jimin\u2019s words mean to him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Jimin giggles quietly and continues to lead Yoongi back to camp. By the time they arrive, the preparations for the feast are already in full swing. There\u2019s a boar roasting over the fire and some of the children sit peeling vegetables. His grandmother is testing their different homemade wines to choose the best tasting, and his mother is carrying in a basket of fruit.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201cHyung!\u201d Wonbin shouts, running up to them. \u201cCome look at your new hut. I helped build it!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Yoongi and Jimin follow after his younger brother, and as they pass the campfire, Yoongi sees Jongho sitting with Soonyoung, helping her peel carrots. Yoongi feels his proverbial hackles raise and forces himself not to let out a growl. Yoongi looks away from Jongho sharply, trying to calm his breathing.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Jimin squeezes his hand, and Yoongi looks up to see the younger boy watching him with a soft, reassuring smile. He has to stop himself from reaching out and stroking Jimin\u2019s plump cheek, though he doesn\u2019t think Jimin would mind too much.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 His new hut stands with its back to the forest. It\u2019s small and simple like all the others, with a rickety wooden door hiding the interior. It's almost completely opposite the omega hut, which is on the other side of camp, and Yoongi hates how far away he\u2019s going to be from Jimin at night.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Inside, its sparsely furnished, with a table and two stools in one corner, a pile of soft furs in the other, a small fireplace, and a wooden chest for Yoongi\u2019s clothes and belongings. It smells stale inside, since no one has stayed in it since it was built, and its been waiting for Yoongi\u2019s this whole time. He would like for it to smell like Jimin; intoxicatingly sweet and citrusy.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201cDo you like it?\u201d Wonbin asks excitedly, and Yoongi smiles at his younger brother, clapping him on the shoulder.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201cIt\u2019s great,\u201d he replies, and Wonbin beams at him. He leaves them to run off and find Inhee to annoy her, most likely, and Yoongi and Jimin duck into the hut, shutting the door behind them.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Yoongi collapses on the array of soft, warm furs with a loud sigh. \u201cIt\u2019s been forever since I\u2019ve slept on something that wasn\u2019t the forest floor.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Jimin lays down next to him and squirms into Yoongi\u2019s space, and Yoongi rolls onto his side and wraps his arms around Jimin. The younger boy tucks his head under Yoongi\u2019s chin and sighs happily. Already, Jimin scent is permeating through the small hut, seeping into the furs, and Yoongi takes comfort in the fact that everything will smell like him for awhile.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201cTell me everything,\u201d Jimin says softly, so Yoongi does. He tells him all the stories of his Solitude, all his trials and hardships and victories. He talks more than he has in a whole year, and by the time he\u2019s finished and Hyeri knocks on the door to announce supper is ready, Yoongi\u2019s throat is sore and his voice is raspy from use. Jimin listens in silent awe as he traces light designs over Yoongi\u2019s chest. When Yoongi sits up, Jimin grumbles in annoyance at being disturbed and follows after a moment.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201cCome on,\u201d Yoongi says, pulling Jimin to his feet. \u201cI\u2019m starving.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Jimin follows him out of the hut, where the sky is getting dark and the pack is gathered around the roaring fire. They all cheer when they see him, once again tackling him with hugs and kisses.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 The food is delicious, better than anything Yoongi\u2019s eaten in what feels like eternity. He eats his weight in meat and then goes back for even more. That\u2019s another thing about presenting as an alpha; he feels likes he\u2019s hungry all the time and can devour more food than should be possible.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Even though his throat hurts, he still recaps some of what he told Jimin to the pack, choosing the most entertaining and exciting stories. By the time bedtime rolls around, Yoongi is full and sleepy and content.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 He hugs Jimin goodnight, subtly scenting him, before he retires to his new hut. Jimin\u2019s scent still clings to the furs, and Yoongi buries his nose in them with a happy sigh. It\u2019s not as great as the real thing but it\u2019ll have to do for now.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 He drifts off to sleep with the scent of honey and maple in his nose.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Jimin is seventeen when Yoongi teaches him how to hunt.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 They head out into the forest, each carrying a bow and a quiver of arrows. It\u2019s a warm summer day and the sun filters down through the leaves above them. Birdsong and the swooshing of branches in the breeze fills the air as Yoongi leads Jimin deeper into the forest. Once he seems satisfied with a small, grassy clearing, Yoongi is very patient in showing Jimin the proper way to hold the bow and how to position his feet. Jimin\u2019s heart begins racing when Yoongi stands behind him, chest flush against Jimin\u2019s back, and places both of his hands over Jimin\u2019s to show him the proper form.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Together, Yoongi and Jimin draw back the bowstring, aiming for a wide tree in front of them. Of course, Jimin misses the first dozen times and starts to get frustrated with himself until Yoongi whispers in his ear, \u201cIf you hit it this time, I\u2019ll give you a kiss.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 With a heavy gulp and a frantically beating heart, Jimin forces himself to focus. Yoongi takes a step back as Jimin draws the bowstring to his cheek, taking aim at the trunk of the tree. He releases his breath the same time as the arrow. It goes whizzing through the air and lands in the tree with a dull \u2018<em>thunk</em>\u2019.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Jimin gasps in shock and spins around to face Yoongi. \u201cHyung, did you see? I did it!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Yoongi in grinning proudly at him, and when he steps in close to Jimin, the younger\u2019s heart begins thudding heavily. \u201cWhere do you want that kiss, sweetling?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Of course Jimin knows where he wants it, but he decides to tease Yoongi a little. His lifts his hand and uses his finger to poke all over his face aggressively, showing where he wants kisses.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Yoongi quirks a brow at Jimin. \u201cA little greedy today, are we?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Jimin doesn\u2019t say anything, just pulls his most impressive pout and fixes Yoongi with his best puppy-eyes. Yoongi sighs in defeat and cups Jimin\u2019s face in both hands. Jimin\u2019s eyes flutter closed and he grins when Yoongi starts pecking wets smooches all over his face, his cheeks and chin and forehead and eyelids and the tip of his nose. Jimin giggles when Yoongi bites gently on his cheek before soothing it with another peck.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 With each press of Yoongi\u2019s lips to his face, Jimin\u2019s heart flutters more and more. This close, he\u2019s surrounded by Yoongi\u2019s intoxicating alpha scent, like the woods and cloves and the most mouthwatering musk. If Jimin could, he\u2019d spend hours with his face buried in Yoongi\u2019s throat, gulping in his scent.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Yoongi gives Jimin\u2019s blushing face a few more kisses before he finally pulls away. \u201cSatisfied?\u201d He asks, his own cheeks a little pink. Jimin grins at him and nods.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201cIf I hit it again will you give me more kisses?\u201d He asks innocently, and Yoongi gapes at him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201cGreedy little brat,\u201d Yoongi mutters, ruffling Jimin\u2019s curly blonde hair, though his eyes are soft and fond. \u201cIf you\u2019re able to shoot actual game, then I\u2019ll give you all the kisses you want.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Jimin\u2019s smile falters. \u201cI have to kill something?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201cWe talked about this, Jiminie,\u201d Yoongi frowns as well. \u201cYou can\u2019t feel bad about killing something for food.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Jimin fiddles with the bowstring. \u201cI know,\u201d he mutters, looking down. \u201cBut I don\u2019t feel right about killing an innocent animal.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Yoongi sighs and reaches out to tug lightly on Jimin's earlobe. \u201cLet\u2019s just keep practicing, okay?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Jimin nods and takes a deep breath to ground himself. He hits the tree a few more times, and even though Yoongi said no more kisses until he shoots something for real, the older boy can\u2019t seem to resist sneaking in from behind each time and pecking a few kisses across Jimin\u2019s cheek and jaw, earning pleased little giggles with each one.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Deeming him a good enough shot, Yoongi leads a reluctant Jimin deeper into the woods, this time moving much more quietly and stealthily. They sneak through the underbrush silently until Yoongi suddenly holds his fist up, indicating for Jimin to freeze. He holds his finger to his lips before pointing through a gap in the bushes.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 There\u2019s a little doe grazing by the foot of a tree about twenty feet in front of them. Jimin\u2019s heart plummets when Yoongi indicates the bow slung across his back. Quietly, Jimin slips off the bow and nocks an arrow, raising it and shakily aiming at the baby deer, who hasn\u2019t seen them yet.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 He looks over at Yoongi, who nods in encouragement. Taking a deep breath, Jimin pulls the bowstring back to his cheek, his heart racing in his chest.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 At the very last second, Jimin shifts his aim just the tiniest bit to the left. He lets loose, and the arrow flies through the air, landing in the tree the doe is grazing at. It lets out a startled noise and takes off into the woods, it\u2019s little hooves galloping across the forest floor until it disappears in the trees.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Jimin lowers the bow and releases a shaky breath. \u201cToo bad,\u201d he says, turning to look at Yoongi.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Yoongi has his arms crossed and is watching Jimin with narrowed eyes. \u201cYou missed on purpose, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Jimin\u2019s eyes widen and he suddenly feels too hot. \u201cN-no! Of course not!\u201d He exclaims loudly, feeling his traitor face betray him as he flushes hard.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Yoongi quirks a brow and takes a step closer. \u201cAre you sure about that? Because if it were true, I\u2019d have to punish you with tickles.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Jimin jumps back just in time as Yoongi lunges at him. He shrieks shrilly and tosses his bow and quiver onto the ground before he spins around and starts running, screaming his head off as he goes. Yoongi is hot on his heels, and Jimin pumps his legs as fast as he can to get as much distance between them as possible.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Jimin races through the underbrush as fast as he can, scaring a flurry of birds into the sky with his loud screeching. He wants to laugh but he\u2019s too busy trying to run for his life, darting in zig-zag patterns in hopes of shaking Yoongi.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Yoongi has always been stronger and faster than Jimin though, and it's only a matter of time until he gets caught. Jimin squeals when Yoongi jumps at him and tackles him into a pile of dried leaves. Yoongi straddles his waist, pinning Jimin\u2019s arms above his head with one hand as Jimin yells and tries to desperately squirm away.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201cNo!\u201d Jimin gasps as Yoongi uses his other hand to begin viciously tickling his stomach. \u201cH-hyung!\u201d He\u2019s laughing despite himself, thrashing around violently as Yoongi\u2019s fingers dig into Jimin\u2019s exposed armpit. He shrieks in laughter, tearing forming in his eyes as he tries to buck Yoongi off.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Yoongi is laughing too, his cheeks flushed with the exertion of keeping a struggling Jimin pinned. \u201cThis is your punishment,\u201d Yoongi growls playfully, pulling Jimin\u2019s tunic up and leaning down to blow raspberries onto his soft little belly.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Jimin shrieks shrilly and jerks spastically, his laughter wild as tears start streaming down his face. \u201cHyung, stop!\u201d Jimin pleads in a gasp.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Yoongi places a kiss next to Jimin\u2019s belly button before he moves up and silences Jimin\u2019s cries with his lips. Jimin immediately relaxes into the kiss, his body going lax as he sighs into Yoongi\u2019s mouth. The alpha\u2019s lips are so soft and warm and taste indescribably good. God, Jimin loves kissing Yoongi. It doesn\u2019t happen to often, but when it does, Jimin savors every second of it. Sparks explode in Jimin\u2019s body when Yoongi just barely flicks his tongue across Jimin\u2019s bottom lip before finally pulling away with a small gasp.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 <em>Oh</em>. They\u2019ve never done <em>that</em> before.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201cLearned your lesson?\u201d Yoongi asks, voice a little rough. He glides his fingers threateningly down to Jimin\u2019s stomach again, who twitches nervously. Jimin nods his head quickly and gives Yoongi his most endearing, innocent smile.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Yoongi visibly gulps and Jimin takes it as a victory. He wiggles his arms away from his sides and holds out his hands imploringly. \u201cWhere\u2019s my present?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Yoongi scoffs at him in disbelief, sitting back up to straddle Jimin\u2019s waist. \u201cWhat makes you think I have another gift for you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Jimin furrows his brow and pouts out his bottom lip. Yoongi almost always has a courting gift hidden on his person at any given time. Over the years Jimin has built up quite a collection of Yoongi\u2019s courting gifts. \u201cYou don\u2019t?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Yoongi lets out a long suffering sigh before he digs around in his pocket. \u201cYou\u2019re such a greedy little brat, you know that?\u201d He grumbles, finally holding something out to Jimin.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 It\u2019s a smooth, oval rock, dark grey in color, with a small hole going completely through the middle of it. \u201cA hag stone!\u201d Jimin exclaims in excitement, taking the rock and examining it closely. \u201cWah, <em>daebak</em>. I\u2019ve always wanted one!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Yoongi rolls off of Jimin so he can sit up, reaching out to brush a few dry leaves stuck in his blonde hair. Jimin looks up from the stone and grins at him. \u201cThank you, hyung. I love it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Yoongi smiles back and dips in to kiss Jimin\u2019s plump, flushed cheek before standing up. He helps Jimin to his feet and they retrace their steps to pick up their fallen bows. Jimin holds Yoongi\u2019s hand the whole time, and he can smell Yoongi\u2019s happiness and satisfaction.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0 It\u2019s a cold winter day when another foreign alpha arrives in their territory. They\u2019re all used to seeing them coming to try to court Soonyoung for her only to reject them. Though Yoongi doesn\u2019t like having strange alphas so close, it doesn\u2019t come as a surprise when another one arrives at camp.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 What does come as a surprise is when instead of heading for Soonyoung, who in the field milking the cow, he heads straight for Jimin, who is sitting next to the fire, bundled up in warm furs.<br>\nHe stops before Jimin, who blinks up at him in surprise, and bows. Actually bows. Then he pulls something out of his pocket and presents it to Jimin.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Yoongi sees fucking red.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 He\u2019d been at the side of the camp talking with his father and uncles about expanding their hunting territory, but the second he sees the alpha trying to court Jimin, he\u2019s gone.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Yoongi stalks across the clearing, rage practically radiating off him and his hands fisted at his sides. The alpha in him is a raging beast, chomping at the bit and wanting nothing more than to tackle the much bigger alpha and beat him into a bloody pulp. To make matters even worse, as Yoongi approaches, he can smell Jimin\u2019s discomfort and nervousness rising off him in waves.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201c...Jimin, right? I\u2019m Taeyoon-\u201d the alpha is saying as Yoongi stops before them. Taeyoon pauses when he sees Yoongi, his nostrils flaring at the territorial alpha pheromones he\u2019s emitting.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Yoongi reaches down and pulls Jimin up off of the log he\u2019s sitting on. He tugs Jimin tightly against his chest and wraps his arms around him possessively, a growl rumbling in his throat as he stares Taeyoon down.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Jimin melts into him, nuzzling into Yoongi\u2019s neck, seemingly completely forgetting about the other alpha as he purrs softly into Yoongi\u2019s skin.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201cHey,\u201d Taeyoon says, looking a little pissed as he takes a step forward, as if to try to yank Jimin from Yoongi\u2019s arms.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 A vicious growl rips from Yoongi\u2019s throat and Taeyoon rears back, his own growl rising up as he glares at Yoongi. Jimin whines, scent spiking in distress as the two alphas stare each other down. Yoongi wants to rip Taeyoon\u2019s fucking head off, but he just barely restrains himself, too focused on keeping Jimin safe in his arms.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201cGet out of here, Jimin doesn\u2019t want you,\u201d Yoongi snarls at Taeyoon, who bares his teeth back.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201cWho the hell are you to decide for him? He might\u2019ve accepted my courting gift before you interrupted,\u201d he snaps back, rising up to his full considerable height menacingly.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 No, Yoongi probably couldn\u2019t take him in a fight, but if it's for Jimin, he\u2019s damn well willing to try. He\u2019d fight to the very death, if he had to.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 By now, the pack has gathered around, watching the showdown of the two alphas nervously.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201cGet the fuck out of here before I kill you,\u201d Yoongi says in a deadly calm voice, even though inside his blood is boiling with rage and his vision is going red around the edges. It physically hurts restraining himself the way he is. All he wants to do is rip Taeyoon\u2019s throat out.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Taeyoon snarls back and balls his fists, the tension in the air rising dangerously, coiling, like the tightness in the air right before a storm is about to break. A fight is about to break out and the pack can sense it, but no one knows what to do.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201cListen here, you-\u201d Taeyoon begins, taking a step forward, but a deep, commanding voice makes him freeze.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201cI suggest you take your leave now, son,\u201d Hongwon says calmly as he steps into the ring the pack had formed around them. He exudes powerful pack alpha vibes, the likes of which even Taeyoon wouldn\u2019t dare challenge. \u201cYou\u2019re not welcome here.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Taeyoon looks between Hongwon, Yoongi, and Jimin, who is still hiding in his arms. \u201cBut-\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201cAs you can well see, Jimin is taken,\u201d Hongwon says firmly as Yoongi tightens his grip around a sniffling Jimin. \u201cYou should leave before you embarrass yourself.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Yoongi watches in satisfaction as Taeyoon turns red and glances around for the first time to see the whole pack watching. He looks once more at Jimin, who still has his face hidden in Yoongi\u2019s neck, before he curls his lip over his teeth in disgust. \u201cFine,\u201d Taeyoon spits, throwing the courting gift he\u2019d been trying to give Jimin, a carved wooden bangle, onto the ground. \u201cHe\u2019s ugly anyway.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Jimin flinches as if he\u2019d been struck as Taeyoon spins around and stalks away into the forest from where he came. Yoongi buries his hand in the back of Jimin\u2019s hair and holds him even closer as the pack whispers and slowly begins to disperse. Hongwon sends Ilhoon to follow Taeyoon and make sure he leaves their territory without any problems.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201cShhh, don\u2019t listen to him, heartling,\u201d Yoongi murmurs gently. \u201cYou\u2019re so beautiful.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Jimin snuffles quietly and Yoongi untangles from the hug and begins pulling Jimin away. Once they\u2019re inside Yoongi\u2019s hut and settled on the furs, Yoongi is shocked to see tears glistening in Jimin\u2019s eyes.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201cOh no,\u201d Yoongi coos, cupping Jimin\u2019s face and stroking his thumbs across his cheekbones. \u201cDon\u2019t cry, pretty,\u201d Yoongi leans in close and nuzzles his nose along Jimin\u2019s cheek. \u201cDon\u2019t listen to that mean alpha. You\u2019re the most beautiful flower in the world.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Jimin giggles quietly when Yoongi keeps nuzzling his cheek. \u201cHyung,\u201d Jimin smiles, pushing out his cheeks and making it even easier for Yoongi to skim his nose along the soft, warm squish.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201cMy prettiest baby,\u201d Yoongi whispers, now placing soft little kisses along Jimin\u2019s jawline. It\u2019s cold in the hut but Jimin\u2019s natural heat is more than enough to keep Yoongi warm.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201cYoongi hyung,\u201d Jimin giggles again when Yoongi noses under his ear, making Jimin squirm.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Yoongi slowly pushes Jimin back on the furs and begins kissing him. Jimin immediately melts into him with a soft sigh, and the taste of Jimin\u2019s lips always makes Yoongi lightheaded. Their lips slot together perfectly, warm and soft and familiar. They kiss for a long time, slow and deep and lazy, sneaking in little bits of tongue here and there that makes both of their scents spike in growing arousal.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Before it can get too heated though, Yoongi finally forces himself to pull away with a gasp, chuckling breathlessly when Jimin follows his mouth for more with a little whine. As much as Yoongi wants Jimin, he wants to wait until everything is perfect for the two of them.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 They both crawl under the piles of furs and snuggle up together, warm and safe in their own little world. Jimin plays with Yoongi\u2019s fingers, looking thoughtful. \u201cYou know I\u2019ll say yes, right?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Yoongi blinks at him in confusion. \u201cTo what?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Jimin blushes and refuses to meet Yoongi\u2019s eye. \u201cWhen you ask me to be your mate.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Yoongi melts and pulls Jimin into a tight hug. God, he smells so incredibly sweet and mouthwatering. \u201cI know,\u201d he whispers. \u201cI would ask now, but I still have lots of gifts to give you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Jimin giggles and kisses the skin under Yoongi\u2019s ear. \u201cHow many years are you planning to court me?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Yoongi smiles into dark space under the furs. \u201cFor however long it takes to keep making you smile.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Jimin is eighteen when a small nomad pack wanders into their territory.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 At first Hongwon had thought it was an attack, and had sent the men out with weapons to meet the intruders. It turns out they were just a small group of seven, hungry and tired after being driven out of their territory by a larger pack.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Hongwon has agreed to let the new pack stay at their camp overnight before going on their way tomorrow, so now the camp is in a flurry as they prepare a meal big enough to feed two packs.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Night has fallen and Jimin is helping Sunsoo and some of the other women with dinner preparations in the kitchen hut while Yoongi is out sitting with the rest of their pack as the newcomers warm themselves by the fire and fill Hongwon in on what happened to them.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Jimin is busy mixing the basting sauce for the meat when Hyeri, who has presented as a beta, enters the hut and sneaks up to him. \u201cJiminie,\u201d she says in a low voice, and Jimin looks up at her in question. \u201cYou might want to see this.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Confused, Jimin joins her at the door and follows her gesture to see a young woman from the new pack sitting next to Yoongi, pressed into his space and fluttering her lashes at him. Yoongi is leaning as far away from her as he can, a pinched expression on his face, and Jimin can see his obvious discomfort.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201cEven I can smell the omega phereomes she\u2019s putting off,\u201d Hyeri says with a disgusted snort.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 A horrible, primal rage overtakes Jimin, and before he knows it, he\u2019s dropping his basting stick on the ground and marching across the clearing towards where everyone is gathered around the roaring fire.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 As he gets closer, Jimin realizes Hyeri was right. The omega girl is putting off so much sickly sweet pheromones that it makes Jimin\u2019s nose sting. She\u2019s giggling at Yoongi and twirling a strand of long, dark hair around her fingers.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Fists clenched at his side to keep himself from strangling this bitch, Jimin steps into the circle of light and promptly sits down on Yoongi\u2019s lap. The girl startles, rearing back and staring at Jimin in shock. Jimin locks eyes with her, leveling her a mean, dangerous smile, before he wraps his arms around Yoongi\u2019s shoulders and begins scenting him in front of everybody. Yoongi grips tightly at Jimin\u2019s hips and tilts his head back just enough to allow Jimin easier access to his neck. A purr, louder than necessary just to be petty, rumbles in Jimin\u2019s throat as he rubs his face back and forth across Yoongi\u2019s scent glands, which makes Jimin a little lightheaded and dizzy with how intoxicating he smells.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Someone coughs awkwardly and Jimin guesses everyone is staring at them, but he doesn\u2019t care. Yoongi is his and he\u2019s going to drench the alpha in his scent so everyone knows.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201cI told you going for Yoongi was pointless,\u201d Jimin recognizes Soonyoung\u2019s voice, sounding amused. \u201cHe and Jimin have belonged to each other for years.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Yoongi seems fine with Jimin\u2019s little display. In fact, he seems outright pleased and smug about the omega\u2019s possessiveness over him, and Jimin assumes it\u2019s an alpha thing.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201cKnock it off, Kimhee,\u201d snaps another voice, and that\u2019s only when Jimin becomes aware of the omega (Kimhee?) hissing softly at their display.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Jimin finally pulls away from Yoongi\u2019s neck, pupils dilated and feeling a little drunk, to see who the voice belongs to. It\u2019s another young woman who screams <em>alpha</em>. She has shoulder length hair and sharp, dark eyes, which are narrowed as she reprimands Kimhee.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Kimhee stops hissing and glares at the alpha girl, crossing her arms and pouting petulantly. Jimin notices Soonyoung gazing with wide eyes at the alpha, looking awed, cheeks dusted with pink. The alpha seems to sense her gaze because she looks at Soonyoung, who promptly flushes red and glances down.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Jimin grins to himself. Maybe there was a reason Soonyoung always rejected the male alphas.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Jimin goes back to happily scenting Yoongi until dinner is ready. Kimhee keeps shooting them dirty looks as Jimin lovingly feeds Yoongi bits of meat and vegetables. Jimin flushes and turns hot when Yoongi sucks the juice of the meat off of Jimin\u2019s fingers, keeping eye contact the whole time.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0 The next morning, they bid teary farewells to Soonyoung as she leaves with the other pack, holding hands with the alpha girl.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Yoongi hates when Jimin gets his heats.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 All he wants to do is help his baby and ease his suffering, but since they\u2019re not technically mated yet, it wouldn\u2019t be acceptable.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 For those three or four days that Jimin is forced to be secluded in the heat hut by himself, Yoongi locks himself in his hut and tries not to think about how much pain Jimin must be in. It\u2019s torture, and sometimes Yoongi almost thinks he can imagine the scent of Jimin\u2019s heat slick all the way from camp.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 He understands why alphas, any alphas, are forbidden from going near the heat hut when there\u2019s an omega occupying it, because Yoongi knows if he even got within a hundred feet of Jimin when he\u2019s in the middle of his heat, he wouldn\u2019t be able to control himself.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Whenever Jimin\u2019s heats end and he arrives back at camp, worn and exhausted, he always smells extra mouthwatering. His sweetness is amplified times ten because of the omega pheromones that are beginning to settle back down after the heat. All Yoongi wants to do is bury his face in Jimin\u2019s neck and inhale forever, which Jimin usually lets him do, because omegas are extra clingy right after a heat.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Today is one such day, and Yoongi is lying eagle spread on his furs when there\u2019s a knock at his door. \u201cJimin is back,\u201d it\u2019s Wonbin\u2019s voice. \u201cShould I send him in?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201cYes,\u201d Yoongi calls back, sitting up and smoothing down his clothes.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 A few moments later, the door creaks open and Jimin steps in, looking completely drained and tired. His scent hits Yoongi like an avalanche and he has to take a deep, calming breath to steady himself. Jimin closes the door and Yoongi holds out his arms. \u201cCome here.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Jimin whimpers and all but dives into Yoongi\u2019s embrace. Yoongi pulls them back onto the furs and wraps Jimin up tight, who is whining softly and pressing his whole body against Yoongi. \u201cWas this one extra difficult?\u201d Yoongi asks quietly, his heart aching at the sight of Jimin\u2019s pain.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Jimin nods miserberably and tucks his face against Yoongi\u2019s scent gland. He\u2019s wearing one of Yoongi\u2019s tunics, a deep red one made of soft cotton, another recent courting gift and one of Jimin\u2019s favorites so far. Yoongi assumes he\u2019d worn it through his heat, and he hopes it brought Jimin a little bit of comfort, having Yoongi\u2019s scent so close.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Yoongi strokes his soft blonde hair and pulls the furs up around them. \u201cGo to sleep, heartling,\u201d he soothes gently, and within moments, Jimin is out cold, the effects of not having been able to sleep for four days finally catching up with him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Yoongi cradles him and pets him until he, too, drifts off to sleep.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Jimin is nineteen when Yoongi finally, <em>finally</em> asks him.</p>\n<p>They\u2019re in their poppy field on a sunny spring day, with Yoongi sitting up and Jimin lying down with his head in the alpha\u2019s lap. His eyes are closed in contentment and he\u2019s simply enjoying the feeling of the warm sun on his skin when Yoongi taps him on the tip of his nose.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201cBaby, I have something for you,\u201d he says, but he sounds different. More nervous than usual. Jimin cracks his eyes open to see Yoongi peering down at him, face a little tense.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Jimin struggles into a sitting position and frowns at Yoongi in concern. \u201cIs everything okay?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Yoongi nods and reaches into his pocket, fiddling with something. \u201cYeah, it\u2019s just\u2026\u201d Yoongi takes a deep breath. \u201cThis is an important one, okay?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Jimin nods in understanding and watches as Yoongi pulls out a beautiful seashell necklace. Jimin gasps and reaches out a hand to finger the shells gently. In the very center glistens a beautiful little pearl, glinting like a jewel in the sun. \u201cHyung, it\u2019s breathtaking,\u201d Jimin breathes in awe. Yoongi smiles at him and Jimin allows him to wrap the necklace around his neck and hook it in the back.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Jimin looks down and touches the shells again, loving how beautiful they look against Yoongi\u2019s red tunic he\u2019s wearing.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201cJiminie,\u201d comes Yoongi\u2019s voice, and Jimin looks up, freezing when Yoongi cups both his cheeks in his large hands. \u201cI love you. You know?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Jimin\u2019s heart swells a thousand times in his chest and warmth surges through him. \u201cI know,\u201d he whispers back.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Yoongi rubs his thumbs over Jimin\u2019s cheeks. \u201cWill you be my mate?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Jimin can\u2019t control his grin. Finally! \u201cYes, you idiot,\u201d he laughs, tackling a surprised Yoongi back into the poppies and starts attacking his face with kisses. \u201cYes! Yes!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Yoongi laughs as well and wraps his arms around Jimin\u2019s waist as he lets the omega assault him. Jimin can\u2019t believe it! After all these years they\u2019ll finally be mates! He\u2019s been waiting for this day his entire life.<br>\nFinally Yoongi gives Jimin a light slap on the ass. \u201cKiss me for real, you little brat.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Jimin is more than happy to comply. He captures Yoongi\u2019s lips clumsily, happiness and euphoria making him feel light as a cloud. Jimin laughs into the kiss, sort of ruining it, but Yoongi doesn\u2019t seem to mind. He just smiles against Jimin\u2019s mouth and pulls him closer.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Eventually they are able to calm down and find a rhythm. Their lips glide together perfectly, warm and smooth. Yoongi\u2019s lips feel so plush against his own, and Jimin moans softly when Yoongi licks into his mouth. The sound must set Yoongi off, because the next thing he knows, Yoongi is flipping him over and pressing him into the soft grass. Then his lips are on Jimin\u2019s again, hungry, desperate.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Jimin\u2019s eyes roll into the back of his head and he clutches at Yoongi\u2019s shirt, pulling him closer. A shiver of pleasure runs through Jimin as Yoongi ravages his mouth, their tongues gliding together, hot and wet. Yoongi presses down on top of him, settling between Jimin\u2019s thighs, which part to accommodate him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 They kiss hard and deep until they have to break apart, gasping for breath. Before Jimin can gather himself, Yoongi is kissing at his neck, sucking hard at the hot skin. Jimin jolts and he feels the first bit of slick leak out of him when Yoongi licks a hot stripe along Jimin\u2019s scent gland.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Yoongi must be able to smell the sudden release of omega pheromones, cause he groans low and licks at Jimin\u2019s neck again. \u201cFuck, you smell so good,\u201d he growls, the sound rumbling in his throat, and Jimin whines, feeling more slick begin to leak out and start to wet the back of his trousers.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Yoongi grazes his teeth along Jimin\u2019s scent gland, right where the mating bite will go, and the omega gasps, instinctually tilting his head back, begging to be claimed. Yoongi growls again, low and guttural at the sight of Jimin submitting to him, but he manages to restrain himself and instead goes back to sucking and licking at the spot.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Jimin buries his hands in Yoongi\u2019s black hair and presses him tight against his neck, loving the feeling of the alphas lips and tongue and teeth on him. Yoongi scent, usually so strong, is overwhelming right now, releasing extra alpha pheromones, and its driving Jimin crazy.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Yoongi presses his hips into Jimin\u2019s, and he feels how Yoongi is already half hard, and <em>oh</em>, Jimin wants his knot. He wants it so bad.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 The thought is just enough to pull Jimin back to his senses. \u201cW-wait, hyung,\u201d he gasps, and involuntary shiver running through him when Yoongi sucks under his jaw. \u201cNot like this.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Yoongi pulls back, pupils blown wide and expression dazed. \u201cHuh?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Jimin gulps and struggles to sit, and Yoongi rolls off of him to let him up. \u201cIt-it has to be special,\u201d Jimin says, feeling lightheaded and dizzy as Yoongi reaches out to play with his fingers. \u201cTonight. Just wait until tonight.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Yoongi licks his swollen lips and stares at Jimin for a moment. He seems dazed as well and it must be taking him longer to process Jimin\u2019s words. Finally he nods and squeezes Jimin\u2019s hands. \u201cWhatever you want, sweetling.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Jimin smiles gratefully and leans in for another quick kiss before he stands up on shaky legs. \u201cDon\u2019t come back to camp until night has fallen,\u201d Jimin says, already turning around and dashing out of the poppy field.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201cWhat?\u201d Yoongi exclaims. \u201cWhat am I supposed to do until then?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201cYou\u2019ll figure it out!\u201d Jimin calls over his shoulder with a grin. Then he\u2019s gone from the field, leaving a confused Yoongi sitting amongst the poppies.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0 After what feels like a thousand eternities, in which Yoongi restlessly paced the forest, night has finally fallen and he\u2019s dashing through the dark woods back to camp.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 He can\u2019t believe it. After all these years of courting and playing their flirty little games, Jimin is finally going to officially become Yoongi\u2019s mate.The thought urges Yoongi on even faster, and he explodes from the trees into camp with so much force that Inhee, who is tending to the embers of the cooking fire, shrieks and jumps about a foot in the air.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Yoongi doesn\u2019t even stop to apologize. He strides across the mostly deserted camp, since everyone has retired to their huts. Yoongi can smell Jimin\u2019s scent coming from his hut and the last few feet feels like he\u2019s moving in slow motion. There\u2019s smoke coming from the chimney, and Yoongi assumes Jimin must have lit a fire to fend off the coldness of the spring night.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Yoongi stops before his door and takes a deep breath to steady himself before he pushes it open.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 The sight that greets Yoongi knocks the air out of his lungs.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Jimin lying on his side on the bed of furs in front of the crackling fireplace, clothed in nothing but a plush white and brown fur that\u2019s just barely covering his modesty, with the seashell necklace around his throat. And the <em>smell</em>. Oh god, Jimin\u2019s omega sweetness permeates every inch of the hut, almost suffocating Yoongi. It makes his head swim and his mouth begin to water.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Jimin is watching him with heavy-lidded eyes, lips parted and a little wet, like he\u2019s been licking them. \u201cAlpha,\u201d he breathes, pulling the furs back to expose his naked body.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Yoongi is on him in an instant. He presses down on Jimin\u2019s bare body and hungrily claims his lips. Jimin immediately mewls into his mouth and opens for him, letting Yoongi lick inside. Jimin wraps his bare thighs around Yoongi\u2019s waist and pulls him closer, his hands carding through messy black hair as they kiss passionately. Yoongi can smell the scent of Jimin\u2019s slick and it lights a fire in his belly, the smell so sweet and heady and perfect.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 He pulls away from Jimin\u2019s mouth with a little bite to his bottom lip before sitting back up and straddling Jimin\u2019s waist. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Jimin whines when he breaks the kiss, reaching for Yoongi with a pout.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201cHave to see,\u201d Yoongi whispers, his gaze taking in every inch of Jimin naked body, perfect in every way. \u201cBeen imagining this for so long.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Jimin blushes scarlet and tries to hide his face, but Yoongi quickly grabs both of his small hands and brings them up to his mouth, kissing his knuckles and fingers tenderly. \u201cDon\u2019t hide from me, Jiminie. You\u2019re so fucking perfect.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Jimin allows Yoongi to guide his arms up until they\u2019re pressed into the furs above his head. \u201cKeep them there,\u201d Yoongi says, before he slowly trails the tips of his fingers down Jimin\u2019s wrists, his forearms, the sensitive skin under his upper arms. Jimin shivers at the light touch but obediently keeps his hands in place. Yoongi thumbs along Jimin\u2019s prominent collar bones, leaning down to press a few featherlight kisses along them, causing Jimin\u2019s breath to hitch.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 He keeps going, using both his hands as he runs them down Jimin\u2019s torso, feeling the smooth, warm skin underneath his palms. He brushes over Jimin\u2019s pink, erect nipples, making the omega gasp, before Yoongi keeps going. His hands settle around Jimin\u2019s small waist, and Yoongi massages his hip bones with his thumbs for a moment before he starts gently stroking Jimin\u2019s little belly with his fingertips. He does it so lightly that it's almost tickling, and Jimin giggles breathlessly, his stomach muscles tensing under Yoongi\u2019s touch.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Yoongi leans down again and peppers kisses across Jimin\u2019s slightly chubby tummy. He\u2019s always loved Jimin\u2019s belly, ever since they were little and he thought it was just a cute thing to poke at. It\u2019s still soft and a little squishy, and Yoongi presses his lips into the hot, flushed skin, a content purr rumbling in his throat. Jimin is beginning to squirm a little, and the smell of his slick gets stronger, but Yoongi wants to take his time with everything.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201cThe prettiest baby I\u2019ve ever seen,\u201d Yoongi murmurs into Jimin\u2019s skin, making the omega blush harder.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Once he\u2019s gotten enough kisses, Yoongi sits back up and maneuvers off Jimin\u2019s body until he\u2019s kneeling on the furs. Them he pulls Jimin close by his thighs, and Jimin gasps and settles them around Yoongi\u2019s waist.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Yoongi continues with his exploration of Jimin\u2019s body. The omega\u2019s little cock is standing hard and erect between his legs, but Yoongi bypasses it and moves onto Jimin\u2019s thighs. \u201cHyung,\u201d Jimin whines petulantly when Yoongi ignores his cock, but the alpha just slaps him lightly on the hip in reprimand.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Yoongi kisses down the expanse of Jimin inner leg, starting from high up on his thigh, which is coated with slick, and Yoongi moans aloud at the taste of it, saliva forming in his mouth. The feeling of Yoongi\u2019s lips combined with the vibration of his moan so close to Jimin\u2019s erection has him letting out a stuttered gasp as his body jerks.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201cSo beautiful,\u201d Yoongi whispers, making Jimin whine in embarrassment.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Slowly, ever so slowly, Yoongi works his way all the way down to Jimin\u2019s ankle, leaving little kisses in his wake that have Jimin sweating. By the time he reaches the tips of his toes, Jimin is panting and squirming, his hands fisted in the furs above his head.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201cHyung, please,\u201d he whimpers, bottom lip trembling. \u201cStop teasing me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Yoongi coos and goes in for a soft kiss, which Jimin meets eagerly, body going pliant under the alpha. They kiss sweetly for a few moments until Yoongi pulls away again. \u201cWill you roll over for me?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Jimin gulps and nods, and while he changes positions, Yoongi quickly rids himself of his clothes. Yoongi groans at the sight of Jimin on his stomach, presented for him. Jimin\u2019s ass and thighs are completely drenched in slick and the smell is making Yoongi dizzy. He smooths his hands over the swell of Jimin perfect ass cheeks before parting them. He hisses at the sight of Jimin\u2019s little pink pucker awaiting him, glistening with slick and begging to be tasted.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Jimin lets out a jerky, surprised moan when Yoongi laves his tongue over him, and the alpha almost passes out with how sweet Jimin tastes, like the nectar of a forbidden fruit. Yoongi wastes no time in trying to lick up every last drop of slick, which is quite the challenge because the more he licks, the more slick Jimin releases with soft, whining little moans.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 God, he tastes so fucking good and Yoongi can\u2019t get enough. When he works his tongue inside, Jimin arches his back and fists his hands in the furs. <em>\u201cO-oh</em>,\u201d he moans, pushing back on Yoongi\u2019s tongue to get him deeper.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 The wet sounds of Yoongi slurping up Jimin\u2019s slick is positively filthy. He uses his tongue on Jimin for a while, thrusting and licking and sucking, until Jimin is crying and begging for more. Then Yoongi works in a finger alongside his tongue and Jimin stutters out a moan, trying to push back for more. \"<em>Ah!</em> H-hyung,\u201d Jimin gasps as Yoongi crooks his finger in such a way that Jimin\u2019s whole body spasms. \u201cM-more.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Yoongi gives Jimin\u2019s hole a few final licks, gathering up as much slick as possible, before he finally pulls away. The entire lower half of his face is wet and glistening with slick, and Yoongi licks it off his lips as he slides another finger into Jimin\u2019s needy hole. Jimin groans and rolls his hips back, his breathing harsh and fast as Yoongi begins to scissor him open. With the copious amounts of slick Jimin is producing, it makes the glide of his fingers easy.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Jimin keeps letting out soft little whines and whimpers as Yoongi works him open. As he continues to thrust into Jimin\u2019s tight, wet heat, Yoongi drapes himself over Jimin\u2019s back and nuzzles into his neck, licking over his scent gland. Jimin\u2019s omega pheromones are going haywire, and Yoongi feels drunk off them.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201cDoes that feel good, baby?\u201d Yoongi breathes into Jimin\u2019s skin as he continues to work his fingers.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Jimin nods frantically, tilting his head so Yoongi has better access to his neck. \u201cS-so good, hyung,\u201d he pants, pushing his ass back on Yoongi\u2019s fingers. \u201cWant another.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Yoongi kisses along Jimin\u2019s jaw before he sits back up to get a better angle. He slowly sinks in a third finger, giving Jimin time to adjust to the stretch. He waits until the omega nods and lets out a little sigh before he begins moving again.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Jimin seems to enjoy the fullness because he\u2019s moaning higher now, trying desperately to push back and get all of Yoongi\u2019s fingers as deep as they can go. His walls clench around Yoongi\u2019s digits, sucking them in greedily, and he moans at the thought of how that tight heat will feel around his cock. The squelching of Yoongi\u2019s fingers moving in and out of Jimin fills the hut and makes the hair on the back of Yoongi\u2019s neck raise.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 He continues to open Jimin up, going slow and steady, until tears are forming in Jimin\u2019s eyes and he\u2019s brokenly begging for more. \u201cPl-please, hyung,\u201d he gasping, looking at Yoongi over his shoulders with pupils blown wide and face flushed. \u201cI\u2019m ready.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Yoongi takes a deep, shaky breath before removing his fingers with a wet squelch. \u201cRoll onto your back again,\u201d Yoongi says gently, rubbing at Jimin\u2019s hip. \u201cI want to see your face.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Jimin rolls unsteadily onto his back, blushing crimson when he meets Yoongi\u2019s awed gaze. For a moment Yoongi doesn\u2019t move, can\u2019t move, simply kneeling between Jimin\u2019s legs. He can\u2019t believe after all these years he\u2019s about to make Jimin his, in every way possible. The realization hits Yoongi like an avalanche and he suddenly feels a little weak.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 As if sensing his thoughts, Jimin holds both of his arms out to Yoongi, reaching for him with a soft smile on his face. \u201cI love you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 It feels like his heart explodes in his chest. Yoongi sucks in a breath and presses flush down on Jimin\u2019s hot body, claiming his lips in a sweet, deep kiss, trying to express everything he\u2019s ever felt for Jimin through it.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 God, he loves this boy with his whole heart. Always has, even when the love was just that of a best friend and companion.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 The fire crackles next to them and the heat of it on his skin and the warmth of Jimin\u2019s flushed body makes Yoongi feels like he\u2019s floating. He breaks away from Jimin\u2019s lips and kisses across his jaw, nipping lightly and making Jimin giggle breathlessly.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201cLove you so much,\u201d Yoongi murmurs into Jimin\u2019s skin as he kisses down his neck. The alpha sucks at Jimin\u2019s scent gland, causing Jimin to whine and release even more pheromones that makes feel Yoongi drunk and heavy. \u201cMy angel.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201cHyung,\u201d Jimin breathes, weaving his hands in Yoongi\u2019s tangled hair to press his mouth even closer. \u201cIt\u2019s always been you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Yoongi nuzzles his face into Jimin\u2019s neck, eyes squeezed shut as Jimin pets his hair, cooing softly as Yoongi simply presses his lips against his scent gland, just breathing him in. Jimin is purring softly, and Yoongi mirrors the sound in his own throat, feeling so full and content in his love\u2019s presence.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 They lay like this for awhile, simply drinking each other in, until Jimin tentatively wraps his legs around Yoongi\u2019s waist and wiggles his hips. Understanding his silent plea, Yoongi chuckles softly, placing another kiss on Jimin\u2019s neck before he pulls away. He leans in until their noses are touching and gazes into Jimin\u2019s eyes.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201cAre you ready?\u201d He whispers, lining his cock up with Jimin\u2019s entrance.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Jimin nods, his lips parting at the feeling of Yoongi so close to where he needs him. Slick is dripping out of him, coating the tip of Yoongi\u2019s cock, which is beading with precome. Yoongi weaves their fingers together and pins them above Jimin\u2019s head again. Them he sinks into Jimin in one smooth motion.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Jimin gasps loudly and Yoongi takes the chance to kiss him again, licking inside his mouth hungrily. Yoongi kisses him deeply as he waits for Jimin to adjust to his sizable length. The feeling of Jimin hot and tight and so, so wet around him is like a punch to the gut, and electricity surges through Yoongi\u2019s body at the feeling. It's almost painful to keep from moving, but he would rather die than hurt Jimin by going too fast.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Yoongi is licking across Jimin swollen bottom lip when the omega shifts his hips hesitantly, testing. He lets out a small sigh into Yoongi\u2019s mouth and rolls his hips again, more sure, searching. The grip of Jimin\u2019s legs around Yoongi\u2019s waist tightens, pulling him closer, and Yoongi gets the hint.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 With incredible slowness, Yoongi pulls out to just the tip, before sinking back in again, still slow and steady. Jimin mewls softly and Yoongi greedily swallows the sound as he bottoms out again, settled so deep inside him that it makes the omega shake under him. They finally break away with a loud gasp of air as Yoongi pulls out again, and he moves his lips to Jimin\u2019s neck, sucking harsh marks onto his scent gland.<br>\nJimin whimpers when Yoongi slides back in again, his hips beginning to roll in time with the alpha\u2019s measured thrusts. \u201c<em>O-oh!</em>\u201d Jimin cries as Yoongi pushes all the way to the hilt, his cock hitting something so deep inside Jimin that his eyes roll back into his head. \u201cOh <em>god</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Slick is squishing out of Jimin\u2019s hole with each deep thrust, coating Yoongi\u2019s groin and dripping down Jimin\u2019s thighs and into the furs under them. \u201cF-feels so good, Jiminie,\u201d Yoongi breathes raggedly into Jimin\u2019s neck. \u201cSo perfect for me. My beautiful omega\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Jimin moans softly at the praise, his head tilted to the side to give Yoongi the best access to his neck. \u201cY-yes,\u201d Jimin jerks violently as Yoongi\u2019s cock brushes against his prostate. \u201cSuch a-ah!-good omega f-for you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Yoongi picks up the pace of his thrusts a little, but he still keeps them slow and measured, sinking in mind-numbingly deep until Jimin\u2019s whole body is shaking and he can\u2019t stop moaning. At some point they\u2019ve stopped holding hands and now Jimin\u2019s are everywhere on Yoongi; tugging his hair, scratching down his back, on his ass trying to pull Yoongi into deeper thrusts.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Jimin is a panting mess under him, his whole body glistening with sweat and his skin pink and flushed, hair plastered to his forehead. He looks like a fucking angel, everything Yoongi\u2019s ever wanted. Yoongi peppers soft kisses along Jimin\u2019s neck and up his jaw as he thrusts in and out of his omega, their bodies rocking together in tandem.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201c<em>Hyung</em>,\u201d Jimin chokes on a moan. A tear slips down his cheek that Yoongi kisses away. He cups Jimin\u2019s face in his hands, staring into his watery eyes and he drives into Jimin again, slow and hard.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201cAre you going to take my knot?\u201d Yoongi whispers, and the words throw Jimin into a full bodied, violent shudder. His back arches, pressing his chest into Yoongi\u2019s, and his eyes flutter closed. Yoongi squeezes Jimin\u2019s cheeks gently in warning. \u201cLook at me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Jimin\u2019s eyes open again, looking at Yoongi, and the expression in them is so dazed and high and hungry that Yoongi moans softly. \u201cAre you going to take my knot like my good omega?\u201d Yoongi asks again, thrusting into Jimin with particular force.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Jimin cries out and nods frantically, somehow forcing himself to keep eye contact with Yoongi. \u201cY-yes,\u201d he whines, his hands back in Yoongi\u2019s hair. \u201cWanna...wanna take your knot like a g-good omega,\u201d his words are beginning to slur. \u201cWant you to-to...fill me up and b-breed me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201c<em>Fuck</em>,\u201d Yoongi growls, feeling heat surge through him at Jimin\u2019s words. There\u2019s a tightness in his groin that is beginning to build and Yoongi knows he won\u2019t last much longer. \u201cGonna make you mine. Gonna mark you up and fill you with my come s-so everyone knows.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Jimin whimpers, rolling his hips frantically as Yoongi\u2019s rhythm begins to falter. \u201cYes, yes,\u201d he pants, moaning out loud when Yoongi licks across his scent glands again. \u201cM-make me yours.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Slick is still dripping out of Jimin each time Yoongi pulls out, drenching the hut in its scent and driving Yoongi crazy. The coil in his groin is tightening with each thrust, pulling taut like a bowstring, and he pants into Jimin\u2019s neck as he gets closer.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Jimin is near delirious, body shaking and vision swimming. \u201cC-close,\u201d he whispers, clutching desperately at Yoongi\u2019s shoulder blades. Yoongi can feel the knot expanding at the base of his cock and Jimin gasps at the new stretch.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Yoongi kisses the juncture between Jimin\u2019s neck and shoulder. Then he sinks his teeth in to complete the mating. Immediately, Yoongi feels a connection to Jimin, an awareness that wasn\u2019t there before as their souls bond.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Jimin wails as he comes, thrashing violently under Yoongi as he releases between their stomachs. His walls clench and spasm so tightly around Yoongi\u2019s cock that it throws him over the edge. He sees white as the knot locks him in place and he releases inside Jimin, spurt after spurt of come until it feels like he\u2019s never going to stop. Jimin gasps and whines as Yoongi fills him, rolling his hips down for more even though he\u2019s barely coherent from his orgasm.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Yoongi moans, long and low, feeling each pump of come into Jimin like a punch in the groin. It seems to go on forever until finally Yoongi\u2019s cock seems to run out. With a gasping sigh, Yoongi collapses on top of Jimin, kissing softly at the new bite mark on his neck to soothe it.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Now they just have to wait for the knot to go down before Yoongi can pull out, and it could be anywhere from ten minutes to an hour from what Yoongi\u2019s heard. They\u2019re both covered in sweat and slick and completely exhausted. Yoongi rests his face on Jimin\u2019s shoulder, purring softly when Jimin begins tiredly carding through Yoongi\u2019s damp hair.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201cThat was...wow,\u201d Jimin breathes, earning a sleepy smile from the alpha.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201cWow is right,\u201d Yoongi murmurs, nuzzling at the damp skin of Jimin\u2019s neck. Even now, he can smell how their scents have permanently mingled and it makes his heart sing.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 They both moan weakly when Yoongi\u2019s cock releases one last final spurt of come into Jimin, like a valiant last hurrah. Jimin trails his fingers across Yoongi\u2019s back, sparking goosebumps on the alpha\u2019s skin at the touch.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201cYou\u2019re mine now,\u201d Yoongi says quietly, pressing his lips to Jimin\u2019s collarbones, and he smells the uptick of happiness in Jimin\u2019s scent.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201cAlways have been,\u201d Jimin replies with a soft smile.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Yoongi presses his ear to Jimin\u2019s chest and hears the steady thumping of his heart, still a little rapid but beginning to calm now, and sighs in contentment.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 They talk quietly about nothing in particular until they both begin to feel heavy with exhaustion. Yoongi\u2019s knot slowly goes down until he\u2019s able to pull gently out of Jimin. He goes to grab something to clean up the copious amounts of come dripping out of Jimin but the omega shakes his head.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201cLater,\u201d he says sleepily, holding out his arms for Yoongi. \u201cCome here.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Yoongi knows Jimin will complain about the dried come in the morning, but he obeys. He crawls up and pulls Jimin close, wrapping his arms tightly around him, and Jimin settles his face in the crook of Yoongi\u2019s neck and curls his hands against the alpha\u2019s chest.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Now that they\u2019re mates, Jimin will move into Yoongi\u2019s hut and they can finally sleep together at nights again. They can be together always, and Yoongi\u2019s never been happier.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Yoongi drifts to sleep to the sound of Jimin\u2019s quiet breathing and the warmth of his mate against his body.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Jimin is awoken to the feeling of lips pressing kisses along his jaw. His eyes flutter open, taking a moment to adjust to the predawn light streaming into the hut with a confused furrow of his brow. Yoongi is cradling Jimin to his chest as he peppers kisses across the omega\u2019s face, his eyes soft and fond as Jimin\u2019s memories come flooding back.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201cMorning,\u201d Yoongi murmurs, smiling softly at his new mate.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Jimin grins sleepily at Yoongi and puckers his lips for a kiss, which Yoongi grants with a chuckle. Jimin lets Yoongi peck his lips chastely a few times, too tired for much more, giggling quietly when Yoongi kisses the tip of his nose. Jimin goes to stretch and it immediately feels like his skin is going to crack with all the dried come and slick coating his stomach, ass and thighs. Jimin makes a sound of pure disgust and Yoongi laughs at him, eyes twinkling.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201cYou should have let me clean you up last night,\u201d he chides gently, and Jimin pouts at him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201cBut I just wanted to sleep,\u201d he whines petulantly, not noticing how softly Yoongi is gazing at him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201cWell, maybe you\u2019ve learned your lesson,\u201d Yoongi replies, huffing a laugh when Jimin smacks at his chest in annoyance. Yoongi lifts his head to peer around the hut. \u201cIt's still pretty early. If we hurry we can get down to the river and clean up before anyone else wakes.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Jimin doesn\u2019t really want to move, still feeling kind of boneless from last night, but he also hates the tight, crusty dryness on his skin. Plus, it\u2019s starting to itch a little. Jimin turns to Yoongi and pulls his very best puppy eyes. \u201cOnly if you carry me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Yoongi narrows his eyes at. \u201cAre you being serious?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Jimin flutters his lashes prettily. \u201cPlease?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Jimin and Yoongi both know that he\u2019s too weak for Jimin and always gives into him no matter what, and Jimin sees the exact moment Yoongi\u2019s resolve crumbles. He pouts mightily and glares at Jimin as he sits up. \u201cYou\u2019re such a damn brat.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Jimin grins at him as Yoongi stands up and throws his clothes on from the night before. \u201cI love you too.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Yoongi just snorts and pulls some fresh clothes out of his wooden chest and shoves them into a leather satchel. Then he tosses a large tunic at Jimin, who sits up and tugs it on, cringing as come flakes off his skin. Once they\u2019re both dressed, Jimin stands on his knees and holds out his arms to Yoongi, who rolls his eyes sweeps Jimin up bridal style. The omega giggles and wraps his arms around Yoongi\u2019s broad shoulders as he kicks the door of the hut open.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 There\u2019s no one outside yet and they manage to make it to the treeline without being spotted. Yoongi is strong from years of hunting and building and heavy lifting, and he carries Jimin with ease through the forest. Jimin rests his head against Yoongi\u2019s shoulder, not noticing when his alpha glances down at him with a smirk.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201cSo,\u201d Yoongi begins casually. \u201cLast night was pretty incredible.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Jimin\u2019s face turns bright red and he buries his face in Yoongi\u2019s shoulder. \u201c<em>Hyung</em>,\u201d Jimin whines, high-pitched and embarrassed.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201cDon\u2019t go getting all modest on me, sweetling,\u201d Yoongi chuckles fondly. \u201cI\u2019ve see your true colors.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Jimin moans in mortification, his whole body flushing. The bite mark on his neck, already halfway healed, tingles with the memories of last night. \u201cShut up,\u201d he mutters heatedly.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201cAll this time I thought my Jiminie was so innocent,\u201d Yoongi continues with a wide smile. \u201cSo pure.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Jimin bangs his fist against Yoongi\u2019s chest in anger, his scowl hidden in Yoongi\u2019s tunic as they arrive at the river. \u201cI hate you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201cOh yeah?\u201d Jimin can hear the grin in Yoongi\u2019s voice. \u201cYou hate me? Well then here.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Then he tosses Jimin right into the icy cold water.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Jimin breaks the surface of the river with an ear-splitting screech of outrage, the cold shocking him to his core. \u201cHyung!\u201d Jimin screams, startling a flock of birds into the air. \u201cI\u2019m going to kill you!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Yoongi just laughs as he lazily starts peeling his clothes off, paying no mind to Jimin fuming in the water. He folds them all neatly and sets them on top of the leather bag at the base of a tree, grabbing a bar of soap from the bag, before slowly sinking into the water with a shiver. Jimin tries not to stare at his wide, broad shoulder or his taut, toned stomach, and he definitely tries not to look any lower than that.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Once Yoongi is submerged up to his shoulders, he tries to reach for Jimin, who splashes him and moves away with a huff, arms crossed and lips pouted. Yoongi chuckles and drifts closer again, shaking water from his hair.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201cAre you mad at me, Jiminie?\u201d Yoongi hums, and the sound of his deep, smooth voice makes Jimin shiver involuntarily. When Jimin doesn\u2019t immediately move away, Yoongi swims closer. \u201cWill you forgive me, baby?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Jimin crosses his arms tighter when Yoongi tries to tug them apart. The tunic is floating around his body in the water and Yoongi grabs it to pull him closer. The alpha nuzzles into Jimin\u2019s face, nosing along his jaw and cheek. \u201cForgive me?\u201d He asks again, brushing his lips over Jimin\u2019s pouted ones.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Jimin feels electricity run through his body and he finds himself leaning into Yoongi, the omega in him drawn by his warmth and scent. Yoongi pulls him into a gentle hug and Jimin rests his head on Yoongi\u2019s bare shoulder. Yoongi rubs up and down Jimin\u2019s back, his hands bunching in the wet material of his tunic.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201cLet\u2019s get this off you,\u201d Yoongi says, and Jimin raises his hands above his head so his alpha can pull it off. Yoongi bunches it up and begins wiping Jimin down with it, and the omega preens at the care and attention, smiling despite trying to remain mad at Yoongi.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Jimin allows Yoongi is scrub away all remnants of dried come and sweat from last night, and it feels so nice that Jimin lets his eyelids droop as Yoongi cleans him up. When he\u2019s done, Yoongi tosses the sopping wet tunic onto the bank of the river to collect later.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Then Yoongi grabs the bar of soap and suds up his hands before handing it to Jimin. The omega purrs when Yoongi begins working his hands into his blonde hair, long fingers massaging against his scalp. Jimin soaps up his hands as well and goes to work in Yoongi\u2019s black hair too. They fall into a comfortable silence as they wash each other\u2019s hair, and Jimin can feel Yoongi\u2019s presence humming in the back of his mind. Jimin\u2019s never felt this close to Yoongi before and it\u2019s like everything\u2019s finally falling into place.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Once they\u2019re both soaped up enough, they dunk their heads under the water to wash it all out. They break the surface with a gasp and take a second to blink water out of their eyes. Yoongi smiles gently and pulls Jimin into a soft kiss, their lips cold and wet but pleasant all the same.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 They kiss for a little while until Yoongi\u2019s lips slowly trail down to Jimin\u2019s neck. The omega sighs and shivers when Yoongi kisses tenderly across the bite mark, and Jimin feels electricity run through his body at the soft touch. He tilts his head back, presenting his neck as much as possible to the alpha, eyes fluttering closed at the wonderful sensation. He can sense Yoongi\u2019s happiness and contentment and a purr rumbles in Jimin\u2019s throat.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201cFeel better?\u201d Yoongi asks when he finally pulls away from Jimin\u2019s neck, pushing the omega\u2019s clean, wet hair away from his face with a tender fingers.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Jimin nods and leans forward, taking Yoongi by surprise when he kisses the tip of his nose, and Jimin grins at the way Yoongi\u2019s eyes widen and his cheeks turn pink. \u201cH-hey,\u201d Yoongi croaks, his lips pushing into a pout. \u201cI\u2019m the only one allowed to give nose kisses.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Jimin scoffs and pecks another kiss on the tip of Yoongi\u2019s nose. \u201cThat\u2019s a stupid rule. You have such a cute nose.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Yoongi flushes even harder. \u201cIt\u2019s not cute!\u201d He splutters indignantly. \u201cIt\u2019s not!\u201d He exclaims when Jimin just grins. Yoongi rolls his eyes and splashes Jimin with water. \u201cCome on, let\u2019s head back. Everyone will be awake by now.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Jimin giggles at Yoongi\u2019s obvious subject change but doesn\u2019t say anything. They wade out of the water and Jimin immediately begins shivering, but thankfully Yoongi had the foresight to pack a blanket with them. He drapes it over Jimin and vigorously dries him off, wiping off as much water as possible. Once Jimin is sufficiently dry, Yoongi towles himself off with much less care and pulls out the fresh clothes he\u2019d packed them.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Yoongi\u2019s clothes are drenched in his scent and Jimin purrs happily when he puts them on. Yoongi didn\u2019t bring them any shoes, so he piggy-backs Jimin, who is squealing with laughter, all the way back through the forest towards camp.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 When they arrive, Yoongi sets Jimin back down and takes his hand as they enter the clearing. Grandmother is trying to start a fire and is the first one to see them. She takes one look at the bite on Jimin\u2019s neck and their linked hands and grabs the pot on the ground next to her. She bangs against it loudly with a ladle and yells, \u201cFinally!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 The harsh clanging hurts Jimin\u2019s ears as Hyeri and Inhee come running out to see what the commotion is. They see Jimin and Yoongi and immediately high five each other, grinning wide as the two new mates blush.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Jongho passes by them and nods at the two of them, long having since given up on Jimin. He\u2019s still been unsuccessful in finding a mate and Jimin feels really bad for him and wishes there was something he could do to help.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Sunsoo comes out of her hut just then, and when she sees the two of them, her eyes fill with tears. She places each of her hands on their cheeks with a proud smile. \u201cI always knew everything was leading up to this moment,\u201d she says, and Jimin smiles shyly and ducks his head.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201cEomma,\u201d Yoongi mutters in embarrassment, and Sunsoo chuckles before releasing them.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019ll have all Jimin\u2019s things moved over to your hut,\u201d she says, giving them one last smile before striding off to find Hongwon.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201cCome on,\u201d Yoongi says, tugging Jimin towards his-<em>their</em>-hut. They awkwardly accept some more congratulation as they pass, looking at each other and giggling nervously.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 When Jimin steps inside the hut, he sighs happily, immediately flooded with the Yoongi\u2019s scent. Yoongi, on the other hand, freezes, jaw clenching as his eyes go wide. \u201cHyung?\u201d Jimin frowns when he sees the expression on his face. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Yoongi licks his lips and swallow thickly. \u201cIt, uh\u2026\u201d he begins, voice a little choked. \u201cIt still smells like your slick in here.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Oh.<em> Oh.</em> Jimin\u2019s whole face burns red as he looks around the hut, his gaze landing on the pile of furs they\u2019d consummated their mating on last night. They\u2019re now all dried and crusted from all the slick Jimin had produced, and they must still smells something fierce.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Jimin groans and buries his hot face in his hands, his whole body burning in mortification. He hears Yoongi chuckle and then feels him pressing close. \u201cDon\u2019t be embarrassed, baby,\u201d Yoongi says softly, trying to tug Jimin\u2019s hands away.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 The omega just whines and burrows deeper, even the tips of his ears turning red. Yoongi laughs quietly and pulls Jimin closer by his hips. \u201cAre you going to get like this every time we have sex?\u201d He whispers into Jimin\u2019s ear, and the omega lets out a squeak, a thrill running through him at Yoongi\u2019s words.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 They\u2019re mated now so technically they can have all the sex they want. The thought makes him blush harder even though his insides begin tingling. Yoongi must smell the change because he smirks against Jimin\u2019s ear, his thumbs rubbing circles into Jimin\u2019s hip bones. \u201cGetting worked up again already, baby?\u201d Yoongi whispers huskily, and Jimin whines again, finally dropping his hands as he presses against Yoongi.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 He\u2019s already feeling slick begin to moisten his hole as Yoongi starts kissing his neck, sucking and licking across the skin. He tilts his head back to allow Yoongi better access and he jerks violently when Yoongi licks across the healing bite mark, making Jimin\u2019s body buzz.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 A loud pounding on the door makes them spring apart.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201cYoongi-yah, you\u2019re on hunting duty with me. Let\u2019s go.\u201d It\u2019s Ilhoon, Yoongi\u2019s uncle, and he\u2019s not known to be a very patient man.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Yoongi groans in annoyance and runs his hand through his hair. Jimin giggles a little hysterically and shoos Yoongi away with his hands. \u201cGo on,\u201d he says with a smile. \u201cI\u2019ll, uh, wash the furs while you\u2019re gone.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Jimin can see Yoongi trying to hide his grin as he nods. He dips in quick and plants a kiss on Jimin\u2019s lips that makes the omega smile. \u201cI\u2019ll be back soon.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0 Jimin has to make three trips to lug all the slick-crusted furs down to the river. On his second trip, Inhee and Wonbin tag along with him and begin teasing him mercilessly when he haltingly explains what he\u2019s doing with a flaming red face. Thankfully, they\u2019d both presented as betas the month before so they can\u2019t smell Jimin\u2019s slick or he knows he would never be able to live it down.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 They are kind enough to help him soak the furs in the river and scrub them out, even though they keep pulling faces of disgust and making noises that makes Jimin\u2019s face burn in mortification. Once they\u2019re done, they hang them over low tree branches by the river to dry, because no way is Jimin hanging them up to dry in camp and having the entire pack know why.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201cWhat does it feel like to produce slick?\u201d Inhee asks bluntly as she wrings the water out of a wet fur. Jimin\u2019s blushes fiercely but before he can answer, Wonbin pipes in with,</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201cI hear it feels like slug slime. Is that true?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201c<em>Stop</em>,\u201d Jimin whines, hiding his face in his hands as the twins cackle at his pain.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201cAw, Jiminie\u2019s all embarrassed. How cute,\u201d Inhee coos, and Jimin slaps her with a wet fur, making her screech.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 That devolves into the three of them chasing each other around and slapping each other with heavy, wet furs, which stings something fierce, Jimin quickly finds out. They\u2019re all aching and splattered with water by the time they get tired, and they slowly trudge back to camp.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 The furs are dried and back in their hut by the time Yoongi gets back after having caught a big buck. That night, they are careful to lay out a few blankets on top of them before Yoongi takes a whimpering Jimin from behind. They fall asleep wrapped up together and Jimin has never been happier.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Jimin is lying on his back on a blanket in the peaceful poppy meadow, soaking up the sun that shines down on him. The air is warm and the birds are singing and he feels so calm and lazy and content that he starts dozing off.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 A crashing in the trees nearby and the sudden smell of a very familiar scent blowing towards him has Jimin opening his eyes. \u201cSorry I\u2019m late,\u201d Yoongi pants as he jogs into the field. \u201cMy father wanted to talk to me about inviting the neighboring pack over in hopes of finally finding a mate for Jongho.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Jimin hums in acknowledgement as Yoongi lays down beside him in the grass. He feels bad that Jongho still hasn\u2019t been able to find a mate, and he hopes that if they meet with this pack that the older alpha will be able to find someone.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Yoongi rolls onto his stomach to give Jimin a sweet kiss that makes the omega smile. Jimin curls his hand around the back of Yoongi\u2019s head and pulls him into a deeper kiss. They lazily makeout in the grass for awhile until Yoongi somehow ends up half on top of him and his hands start wandering around Jimin\u2019s body; sliding down his waist and settling around his hips, squeezing with just the right amount of pressure. The weight of Yoongi\u2019s body, now a familiar sensation, feels so damn good that a soft moan escapes his lips as they kiss. Yoongi\u2019s grip around his hips tightens and he nudges Jimin\u2019s thighs aside with his knee and settles between them.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 The scent of Yoongi\u2019s growing arousal makes Jimin feel drunk and high. He mewls softly when Yoongi pulls away from his mouth and settles his lips on Jimin healed over mating bite. A surge of prickling electricity shoots through Jimin when Yoongi sucks harshly at the spot and his hips buck up involuntarily.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 When Yoongi presses his half hard erection into Jimin\u2019s, the omega gasps and tries to grind down on him. Arousal buzzes under his skin, making him grow hot and needy as Yoongi licks and nips at Jimin\u2019s neck. Jimin starts tugging impatiently at the back of Yoongi\u2019s tunic, his mouth hanging open as he pants heavily. \u201cCome on, hyung, please,\u201d he groans, his omega pheromones going wild from Yoongi mouthing at his scent glands. He can feel slick beginning to trickle out of his hole, seeping into the back of his breeches.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Yoongi chuckles against his skin as he grinds down on Jimin again. \u201cHere? Really, heartling?\u201d Yoongi asks, but Jimin can\u2019t even find it in himself to be ashamed. \u201cWhat if someone finds us?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Jimin can\u2019t quite bite back the moan that escapes him at the thought, and Yoongi goes still on top of him. He lifts his head to look at Jimin, and he sees Yoongi\u2019s pupils are blown wide and he looks a little feral. \u201cYou like that? The thought of someone walking in on me fucking you like the good omega you are?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Jimin whimpers pathetically, Yoongi\u2019s words causing slick to start gushing out of him, he and claws with more desperation at Yoongi\u2019s clothes. \u201cY-yes,\u201d Jimin pants, wiggling his hips, trying to entice Yoongi. It seems to work because Yoongi sits back up and quickly pulls Jimin\u2019s boots off before roughly tugging his breeches down with a few sharp tugs.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Jimin\u2019s small cock, hard and already beading with precome, slaps against his stomach, and Yoongi gives it a single pump that has Jimin jerking under him with a gasp. Then Yoongi runs his hands down Jimin\u2019s hot thighs, making the omega purr at his touch.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Jimin, in a moment of bravery, hooks a leg around Yoongi\u2019s waist and seamlessly flips him over on the blanket. Yoongi lets out a grunt of surprise as Jimin straddles him, his small fingers already fumbling with the ties of Yoongi\u2019s breeches. Jimin feels so empty, needs Yoongi in him right now to fill him up nice and good.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Once untied, Jimin shoves Yoongi\u2019s breeches down just enough to release his cock, long and thick and achingly hard, and Jimin begins salivating at the sight. Before Yoongi can really figure out what\u2019s going on, Jimin hovers over his cock and slams down in one hard motion, already opened up from when they\u2019d fucked earlier that morning.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201c<em>Fuck!\u201d</em> Yoongi cries, his hips jerking involuntarily at suddenly finding himself encased in Jimin\u2019s tight, wet heat. Yoongi grips at Jimin\u2019s hips, tight enough to leave bruises. \u201cG-give me a little warning next time, Jiminie.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Jimin just smiles down at him mischievously and begins fucking himself on Yoongi\u2019s cock at a bruising pace. Everytime he pulls up, slick squishes out of him and drips down his thighs, drenching the skin around Yoongi\u2019s groin and staining his breeches.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Jimin bounces up and down, eyes fluttering closed and mouth tipping open in pleasure. Yoongi\u2019s big hands wrap around and grab at Jimin\u2019s ass cheeks, parting them, gripping the flesh roughly as he lets Jimin fuck himself on his cock. Yoongi is groaning and panting, watching Jimin on top of his with lustful, heavy-lidded eyes.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Oh god, Yoongi feels so amazing inside him, stretching him to the limits and brushing against that spot deep within that makes Jimin see stars. He braces his hands on Yoongi\u2019s chest and slows down a little, rolling his hips in deep circles that make him cry out when the tip of Yoongi\u2019s cock brushes against his prostate.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201c<em>A-ah!</em>\u201d Jimin gasps, grinding in a hard circle again, and electricity sparks up his spine and his rhythm falters for a second. He knows he isn\u2019t going to last long at this pace.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Jimin removes one hand from Yoongi\u2019s chest and lifts up the tunic of Yoongi\u2019s that\u2019s he\u2019s wearing. He pushes it past his chest and thumbs over his sensitive nipples as he bounces on Yoongi\u2019s cock. His touch elicits sparks and Jimin moans, his head falling back as he gets lost in the pleasure. Yoongi is still kneading his ass, fingernails digging into the soft skin with just enough pain that it makes Jimin whine in pleasure and grind down harder.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201cFuck, look at you,\u201d Yoongi hisses, his deep, raspy voice sending tremors through Jimin\u2019s body. \u201cLook what a little slut you are, fucking yourself on my cock.\u201d Yoongi slaps his ass sharply and Jimin cries out, his movements faltering. \u201cWho knew my little omega would be such a cockslut?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Jimin whimpers, his whole body flushing with prickly heat, and he nods frantically. \u201cA-always want alpha\u2019s c-cock,\u201d Jimin pants, grinding down deep on Yoongi and hitting his prostate dead one, making him keen loudly as pleasure rolls through him. His thighs are beginning to ache and burn but he doesn\u2019t care. \u201cF-fills me up so good.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Yoongi moans and Jimin reaches back to grabs both of the alpha\u2019s hands off his ass to place them on his chest, right over his nipples. Yoongi takes the silent cue and immediately begins playing with them, using his long fingers to pinch and roll and rub them. Like in all things, Yoongi\u2019s fingers feel so much better, and Jimin can\u2019t stop letting out little mewling moans as he rolls his hips down on Yoongi.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201cH-hyung...alpha,\u201d Jimin whines, gasping each time Yoongi\u2019s cock catches against his prostate, causing heat to begin pooling in his groin. \u201cFucks me so-<em>ahh!</em>-g-good.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Yoongi presses his thumbs into Jimin\u2019s nipples as the omega rides him. \u201cYou like that, baby?\u201d Yoongi growls, his hips twitching, wanting to fuck up into Jimin but somehow restraining himself. \u201cYou going to let your alpha knot you? Let me breed you and fill you up with my pups?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Jimin shudders and jerks so violently that it completely throws him out of rhythm, so Yoongi takes matters into his own hands. He grips Jimin tight by the hips, plants his feet on the ground, and rams up into Jimin hard.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Jimin <em>screams</em> and falls forward onto Yoongi\u2019s chest as the alpha fucks up into him at a brutal pace. Jimin noses his way into Yoongi\u2019s neck as his mate slams into him, slick dripping out with each thrust and making a mess everywhere. His mouth is slack, his swollen lips pressed against Yoongi\u2019s scent gland and little gasps and whimpers escaping him each time Yoongi pistons into him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 The heat in his belly is building rapidly, tightening like a coil, and he knows he\u2019s about to break. Jimin moans and pushes back when Yoongi\u2019s thrusting becomes more shallow and he feels the knot beginning to grow, stretching him even more, almost to the point of pain but it feels so damn good, so right.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Yoongi gives one more sharp thrust that hits his prostate dead on and Jimin tumbles over the edge. He moans long and high as he comes between their stomachs, a tidal wave of pleasure rocking through him as his vision goes white. Yoongi groans, and the next thing he knows, Jimin is being pumped full of come. He can feel Yoongi\u2019s cock pulsating inside him, releasing bucket loads of his seed as the knot locks him in place. The omega in Jimin preens at the feeling and he starts purring tiredly, burrowing deeper into Yoongi\u2019s neck as he continues to release inside him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201cAlpha,\u201d Jimin whines weakly, wiggling back to try to take even more of Yoongi\u2019s come, his delirium from his orgasm making him a little desperate.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201cShhh,\u201d Yoongi soothes gently, rubbing up and down on Jimin\u2019s back. \u201cCalm down, baby. You did so good.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Jimin settles at his words and goes limp on top of him with a sigh. \u201cF-feels so nice\u2026\u201d Jimin mumbles, his words slurring as Yoongi slips his hands under the tunic and strokes his bare back. \u201cFill me up with...pups\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 They\u2019ve discovered that Jimin gets a little spacey and out of it after sex, so Yoongi just chuckles and lightly scratches Jimin\u2019s back, making the omega purr even harder.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Jimin must have fallen asleep for a little bit, because when he wakes up, Yoongi\u2019s knot has gone down and he\u2019s gently pulling out. Jimin whines weakly in protest because he hates feeling empty, especially after Yoongi\u2019s knotted him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201cI know,\u201d Yoongi comforts him softly, rubbing over the soft skin of Jimin\u2019s ass cheeks. \u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Jimin winces and whimpers in loss when Yoongi pulls out and bucket loads of come and slick immediately come dripping out. The omega part of him hates losing even an ounce of Yoongi\u2019s come and he wishes there was a way he could keep it in for longer.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Yoongi gently rolls Jimin over and onto his back on the blanket, using a corner of the sheet to wipe up as much of the mess coating Jimin ass and thighs as he can. Jimin hums happily under the attention, absentmindedly watching a bright red poppy next to him swaying in the breeze as Yoongi cleans him up.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 When they\u2019re both dressed again, Yoongi lays down next to Jimin and the omega curls into him with a content sigh. They nap in the warm sun for hours, sharing lazy kisses every time they blink awake for a few moments before dozing off again, and Jimin truly doesn\u2019t think he could be happier than in this moment.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0 The neighboring pack arrives in their territory a month later. It\u2019s been arranged for them to stay a week, and Yoongi is on edge, weary about having these strangers living with them for so long. He\u2019s extra worried about Jimin and his safety, though now that he\u2019s mated, the odds of another alpha approaching him are almost at zero. Jimin, too, Yoongi has noticed, has been extra possessive of him, even to their own pack members, scent marking Yoongi like crazy and growling when anyone gets too close. Yoongi assumes he\u2019s remembering the last time an omega had flirted with him, and he expects his mate is loathe to let it happen again.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 The day that the other pack arrives is tense for the both of them, and they stand off by their hut as their family gathers around to greet the newcomers. Jimin has his arms latched around Yoongi\u2019s waist and his cheek squished against his chest, and Yoongi has an arm draped protectively around Jimin\u2019s shoulders.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 They both perk up when they see Jongho approaching the newcomers, a group of ten with the rest of their pack saying behind in their territory. There\u2019s a young man, probably around Yoongi\u2019s age, small and petite and very obviously an omega, standing next to his pack alpha as he shyly looks around the new surroundings.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Yoongi and Jimin both see it the moment it happens. One second, Jongho is walking towards the strangers, and then the next the small omega is looking up at him. Jongho freezes in place and his eyes widen, and across from him, the omega looks like he\u2019s seen a ghost.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Jimin giggles at the scene before him as Jongho and the omega stare at each other in awe. \u201cThat was fast.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Jongho courts the omega, Sungwoon, for five days before he proposes the mating. On the seventh day, Sungwoon waves goodbye to his pack as they head back home and he stays behind, holding Jongho\u2019s hand tightly.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Yoongi, long having put aside his rivalry with Jongho, couldn\u2019t be happier for him. His cousin has been in search of a mate for far too long, and Yoongi is glad he\u2019s finally found someone. Even if, Yoongi quickly finds out, they have incredibly loud sex that makes Jimin giggle and blush furiously when they hear it.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Jimin had just turned twenty when his first heat as a mated omega arrives.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 He\u2019d felt the tell tale signs, the rising of his temperature, the profuse sweating, the sudden sensitivity to scents, and the clinging neediness to be touched and petted. His omega pheromones had also spiked, and if he hadn\u2019t already known, Yoongi\u2019s sudden possessiveness and overprotectiveness would have tipped him off.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 For the week leading up to his full heat, Yoongi is with him constantly, always keeping some sort of contact with Jimin\u2019s skin and growling dangerously at anyone who comes close to Jimin, including other omegas. Jimin though, in his pre-heat haze, loves the strong alpha display Yoongi is putting on, practically eats it up, purring at the feeling of being so well cared for. He spends almost every waking moment with his nose buried in Yoongi\u2019s neck, drawing strength and comfort from him and feeling much calmer with his alpha\u2019s scent so close.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Jimin will whine pitifully if Yoongi has to leave his side even for a second, usually to change into fresh clothes, go grab them two bowls of food, or to go relieve himself outside. When he returns, JImin clings onto him and refuses to let go, and Yoongi will murmur soothing words to him and stroke his back to calm him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 A few days before he feels like the heat is about to hit, he and Yoongi pack up some supplies and trek out to the heat hut so they can be alone. It also helps to calm down Yoongi\u2019s territorialism, being away from the threat of other alphas so close to his mate. They spread out their supplies; food and water, fresh clothes and plenty of clean towels, and they hunker down to wait for the worst.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Jimin wakes up in the middle of the night in full heat.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 His skin is on fire, hot to the touch, and he feels like he\u2019s burning alive from the inside out. His whole body aches, throbbing with pain, and every little brush of his clothes against him is like a harsh whip lash. He\u2019s already drenched his sleep pants with slick, there\u2019s so much that even the furs under him are damp.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 A high pitched whine of pain escapes Jimin, and Yoongi is awake immediately. His alpha\u2019s hands are suddenly on him, petting and soothing the burn, and Jimin sobs in at the instant relief his touch brings. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, baby,\u201d Yoongi says, brushing Jimin\u2019s sweaty hair out of his face. \u201cI\u2019ve got you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 His deep, raspy timbre makes Jimin\u2019s body shudder and slick gush out of him, his hole fluttering around nothing. Jimin\u2019s inside are positively aching, begging to be filled, begging to take Yoongi\u2019s knot. He wants it so bad it hurts. \u201cA-alpha,\u201d Jimin gasps, rutting his rock hard erection against Yoongi\u2019s thigh. \u201cP-please.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201cOkay, heartling, okay,\u201d Yoongi whispers, dipping in to suck harshly at Jimin\u2019s mating bite, which makes Jimin cry out and convulse wildly. Then he sits up and roughly tugs Jimin\u2019s sopping wet breeches down, pulling off his own just as fast. He quickly rids both of them of their tunics, and Jimin feels a little better without any rough fabric rubbing against his skin.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Jimin rolls onto his front and pushes his ass, glossy with slick, up for Yoongi, presenting for him. He\u2019s gasping in anticipation, his greedy hole desperate for something, needing to be filled before he goes insane. The fire under his skin is eating him alive and Jimin starts crying before he can stop himself, slick oozing out of him and dripping down his thighs and onto the furs.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 He cries out when Yoongi parts his wet cheeks and thumbs over his fluttering hole, his nerve endings sparking and making him rut into the furs. \u201cH-hurry,\u201d Jimin begs, his breathing becoming labored and harsh.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Jimin barely has a second to register Yoongi\u2019s cock head at his entrance before his mate is slamming inside in one go. Jimin <em>screams</em> and convulses wildly on the furs, the instant relief of having something so thick and long inside him making his brain short circuit for a moment.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Then Yoongi is thrusting, brushing against his prostate a few times, and Jimin is already coming with a wail, his whole body shuddering violently. Yoongi doesn\u2019t even pause, just keeps fucking him through his orgasm, and Jimin is crying under him, pushing back for more, the burn under his skin not even calming for a moment.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Slick is gushing out each time Yoongi fucks back into him, and the sound is so squishy and wet and lewd that it almost makes Jimin come again. Yoongi\u2019s hands are on him, on his waist and his hips and his ass, and his touch is like a balm to Jimin\u2019s aching skin. Yoongi keeps pistoning into him, brushing against Jimin\u2019s prostate each time and making him see stars. Through the fog in his brain, Jimin realizes Yoongi is growling to himself as he fucks his omega, and the sound tips Jimin over the edge again.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 He keens shrilly as pleasure crashes into him and blinds him for a moment, feeling everything shatter inside him. He chokes on his sobs as he comes into the furs again, his entire body shaking with the force oh his climax.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 He\u2019s still achingly hard though, and he only needs about three seconds of recovery. Yoongi is still drilling into Jimin and he can\u2019t seem to decide between pushing back on Yoongi\u2019s cock or rutting into the soiled furs under him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Yoongi has Jimin gripped tightly by his hips, pulling him back onto hard thrusts that have him hitting that sweet spot deep inside Jimin. \u201c<em>O-oh!</em>\u201d Jimin cries out as his eyes squeeze shut, his hands fisting in the furs. \u201cH-harder!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Yoongi grunts and somehow starts fucking Jimin with even more force, slamming into him so hard that the smacking of his hips on Jimin\u2019s ass as he thrusts actually stings. Jimin\u2019s eyes are dripping with tears and his mouth is hanging slack against the furs, and he doesn\u2019t even notice when he starts drooling. Slick is still leaking out of him each time Yoongi pulls out and thrusts back in, completely soaking the backs of his thighs and pooling in the furs below him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Yoongi fucks his hard and fast, his movements unforgiving and everything Jimin is needing. It feels indescribably good, the feeling of Yoongi stretching him so full, hitting so deep inside him that Jimin\u2019s toes curl. If he thought there was a lot of slick the other times they\u2019ve had sex, it\u2019s nothing compared to this. Jimin is like a waterfall, positively gushing and making a wet mess of everything, and each time Yoongi fucks into him, more slick squelches out.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 His third orgasm builds slower than the first two, with Yoongi\u2019s relentless rhythm driving into his prostate on each thrust. He\u2019s sobbing freely now, tears streaming down his ruddy cheeks as the pleasure begins building in his body again. Above him, Yoongi is grunting as he fucks Jimin, his breathing growing harsher and faster. Then, Jimin feels Yoongi\u2019s knot beginning to grow and he cries harder, pushing back on Yoongi desperately.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201cY-yes,\u201d Jimin babbles incoherently. \u201cKnot me, a-alpha\u2026fill me-<em>oh!</em>-up and b-breed me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Yoongi growls and pushes in one final time as the knot swells, locking him in place before he comes with a low moan. At the feeling of Yoongi\u2019s seed pumping into him and the knot stretching him to his limits, Jimin climaxes again. He wails loudly and his body seizes up as ecstasy rocks through him so intensely it's almost painful.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Finally, he goes limp on the dirty furs in exhaustion, the burn under his skin finally calming down for now. Yoongi drapes his body across Jimin\u2019s back, nosing and kissing at his neck, and Jimin mewls softly each time he feels more come pumping inside him, swelling his belly up with how much there is.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201cBetter?\u201d Yoongi whispers, kissing across Jimin\u2019s sweaty shoulders.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201cF-for now,\u201d Jimin slurs, his eyelids drooping as a purr rumbles in his throat at the feeling of Yoongi\u2019s seed filling him up so full.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 They remain like this for a little over ten minutes as Yoongi\u2019s knot slowly goes down, until Jimin feels the heat rising under his skin again and he starts whimpering. Yoongi goes to pull out and Jimin panics, reaching back to grab Yoongi by the hip to stop him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201cNo!\u201d Jimin cries out, and Yoongi freezes, probably afraid he\u2019s hurt the omega. \u201cC-can\u2019t lose it\u2026\u201d Jimin sniffles pathetically. \u201cWant your p-pups.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Yoongi coos softly and peppers kisses across Jimin neck. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, baby,\u201d he soothes as he noses at Jimin\u2019s scent gland. \u201cI\u2019ll give you more.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Jimin settles a little at this and allows Yoongi to pull out, though he whimpers loudly at the sudden loss of his cock combined with what feels like gallons of liquid spilling out of him.<br>\nYoongi rolls Jimin onto his back away from the mess he\u2019s made and settles between his thighs just as Jimin begins panting again, rolling his hips in search of any friction as the heat becomes unbearable.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201cH-hurry, please hu-<em>ahh!\u201d</em></p>\n<p>\u00a0 Jimin\u2019s begging is cut off by Yoongi sliding back inside him in one sharp thrust. Jimin cries out and shudders violently as Yoongi immediately starts pounding into him, fucking the leaking come and slick back inside him. Jimin wraps his thighs tightly around Yoongi\u2019s waist, moaning when the alpha presses in close and starts licking and sucking harshly at his neck. Jimin digs his heels into Yoongi\u2019s ass cheeks, trying to draw him even deeper.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201cFuck, you feel so good. My beautiful omega,\u201d Yoongi hisses into Jimin\u2019s skin, earning sobbing whines from Jimin as Yoongi punctuates each word with a thrust.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Jimin can feel every drag of Yoongi\u2019s cock inside him, every curve and line sliding against his walls, hitting that little bundle of nerves inside him that has Jimin babbling nonsense and drool dripping down his chin. His eyes are squeezed shut and his head is thrown back to present his neck to Yoongi, his arms wrapped tightly around Yoongi\u2019s sweaty shoulders in attempts to pull him even closer.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Yoongi pauses in thrusting just long enough to grab Jimin\u2019s left leg and hike it over his shoulder, bending Jimin almost clean in half. The new angle opens Jimin up so wide and has Yoongi hitting his prostate so perfectly that he screams and his eyes roll back into his head as his body convulses wildly. Yoongi slams in a few more times and bites down on Jimin\u2019s mating mark, and he comes again with a wail, white hot pleasure surging through him and blinding him for a moment. His cock twitches weakly between their bodies and spurts a small string of white come onto his slick-soaked belly.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Yoongi\u2019s rhythm falters as he gives a few more thrusts, groaning low, and Jimin moans when Yoongi\u2019s knot begins swelling again, stretching him to the limit. \u201cYes, yes,\u201d Jimin gasps, rolling his head back and forth on the furs, vision blurry and chin slick with spit. \u201cK-knot me\u2026\u201d he slurs drunkenly as Yoongi buries himself deep in Jimin and stills as the knot expands. \u201cF...fill me up\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Yoongi hisses as he comes, and the feeling of being pumped so full of Yoongi\u2019s warm seed throws a startled Jimin into yet another orgasm. He shrieks shrilly and spasms wildly under the alpha, his mouth stretching open in a silent scream as the climax is all but ripped from his oversensitive body. His little cock shoots blanks as Jimin gasps harshly and thrashes violently, his vision going completely white.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 It takes him awhile to come down from the high, and when he does, Yoongi is gently kissing his cheeks and rubbing a hand over his belly, which is distended after taking so much come. \u201cShhh,\u201d he soothes softly as Jimin shakes under him. \u201cYou did so well, beautiful. So good for me. Such a perfect little omega.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Jimin mewls weekly, glowing at the praise even as his consciousness begins to slip. The burn of the heat is bearable for now, and he\u2019s absolutely exhausted. The last thing he\u2019s aware of is Yoongi gingerly pulling out of him before Jimin passes out.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Jimin doesn\u2019t know how long he was out before the heat boiling under his skin wakes him up again. The first thing he notices is that he\u2019s been wiped clean of all the come and slick coating his body and that Yoongi is curled up against his back, face nestled in the back of Jimin\u2019s neck and his arms around the omega\u2019s waist.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Jimin also feels something very hard and prominent poking into his backside, and he realizes his heightened omega pheromones must be keeping Yoongi in a constant state of arousal, even in his sleep. Jimin whimpers and pushes back, trying to spear himself on Yoongi\u2019s cock, his greedy hole clenching around nothing and slick already leaking out.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Yoongi\u2019s hold around Jimin tightens and he presses a kiss onto the back of his neck as he wakes. \u201cDid you sleep good?\u201d His deep voice is a low rumble, raspy and thick from just having woken up, and Jimin moans, more slick pouring out of him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201cP-please,\u201d Jimin begs as a shudder of desire rolls through him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 They fuck in a spooning position, with Yoongi pressed against his back and one arm holding Jimin\u2019s leg up and out of the way so he can get a better angle. It\u2019s the quietest orgasm he has so far, moaning into the furs as he comes again, pleasure rocking through his body and setting his blood on fire.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Then Yoongi maneuvers him onto his hands and knees and takes him from behind, drawing two more orgasms out of Jimin before he knots him again. He collapses on his chest, teary-eyed and face covered in drool, babbling incoherently as he takes all of Yoongi\u2019s come, purring and delirious at the wonderful feeling of Yoongi\u2019s knot inside him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 By this point, Jimin has lost all sense of time and he has no idea how long they\u2019ve been going at it. He doesn\u2019t know if it\u2019s been hours or days.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 After Yoongi\u2019s knot goes down and he pulls out, the alpha forces Jimin to gulps down lots of water and eat a few strips of dried meat before the heat acts up again. Jimin complains at first, but then he does have to admit that he feels better after eating something.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 After that, Yoongi makes Jimin come once with his long, slender fingers and another with his sinful tongue, slurping up the copious amounts of Jimin\u2019s slick like it\u2019s the most delicious thing he\u2019s ever tasted.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 After that, Jimin falls asleep again and Yoongi wipes him clean and kisses his swollen belly before lying down next to him to sleep until Jimin wakes up again.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Jimin loses track of how many times he comes after he wakes up, his mind delirious and heat-fogged. Then, after what feels like days, Jimin\u2019s heat finally breaks right as Yoongi\u2019s knot is locking them into place for the last time. Jimin climaxes with a shuddering sigh and goes limp under Yoongi, the heat finally fading away and leaving Jimin absolutely exhausted.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201cIs it over?\u201d Yoongi whispers, kissing across Jimin\u2019s face while they wait for the knot to go down. Jimin nods weakly and smiles tiredly when Yoongi nuzzles into his neck.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 They spend the rest of the day recovering, simply cuddling and catching up on their sleep. Finally, Yoongi somehow convinces Jimin to get up and go bathe in the stream outside.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 The water is freezing but it feels good against his skin, where Jimin swears he can still feel the ghost of the heat. Yoongi uses a bar of floral smelling soap and scrubs him down thoroughly, cleaning off days\u2019 worth of come and slick and sweat. He gets his hair washed and his shoulders massaged, and even though his body still feels over sensitive after the heat, Yoongi\u2019s hands on him feel so good.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 After they\u2019re both all clean, Jimin naps on a big, flat rock by the riverbank, soaking up the warm sun with his head in Yoongi\u2019s lap as his alpha strokes through his damp hair. Occasionally, Yoongi will press a blueberry to Jimin\u2019s lips, who opens them obediently and chews the sweet fruit without opening his eyes.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 After awhile, Jimin feels strong enough to make the trip back to camp, and Yoongi quickly packs up their supplies, hurrying because Jimin, always extra clingy after his heats, starts whining pathetically and calling for Yoongi.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 They walk hand-in-hand part way, until Jimin gets too tired and Yoongi carries him the rest of the way. No one bothers them when they get back to camp just as the sun is setting, and they head straight for their hut. Jimin collapses on the soft furs with a sigh of contentment, the scent of his and Yoongi\u2019s home washing over him and making him feel much calmer.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Yoongi had installed a wooden shelf above the fireplace where Jimin has displayed the courting gifts he\u2019s received over the years. The very first gift, the dried and pressed poppy, is up there, along with the white river rock and the hag stone and the carved wolf. There\u2019s a large hunk of amber and a little wooden bowl filled with delicate bird eggshells and beautiful gleaming feathers. There\u2019s more stones and a little stick doll Yoongi had given him shortly after he\u2019d gotten back from his Solitude. The seashell necklace is also up there, where Jimin puts it when he\u2019s not wearing it. Seeing all his treasured gifts brings a sleepy smile to Jimin\u2019s face as he nuzzles into the furs that smell of him and Yoongi.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Jimin drifts to sleep curled around Yoongi, absentmindedly thinking how lucky he is to have him as his alpha.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0 It\u2019s a few weeks after his heat that Jimin starts feeling a little sick. His tummy kind of hurts and he feels a little nauseous, and he blames it on the stew he\u2019d had for breakfast, which he had noticed tasted a little off.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Yoongi is out hunting with the others or else he\u2019d be fussing over his mate, insisting that Yoongi\u2019s grandmother, who is skilled at healing, look him over. Jimin pushes his discomfort to the back of his mind and follows Sunsoo out to the small field where they keep their livestock to help her milk the cow. He\u2019s placing the bucket under the cow while Sunsoo is talking when the nauseousness becomes too much.<br>\nWith a gasp, he staggers away a few steps and throws up into a clump of weeds, his throat burning and his eyes watering. Sunsoo is there immediately, rubbing at his back and handing him a handkerchief to wipe his mouth.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201cAre you okay, Jiminie?\u201d She asks, her eyes wide with concern when Jimin straightens with a groan.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Jimin rubs at his roiling tummy and nods, feeling a little better after having thrown up. \u201cI think the stew this morning made me sick.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 When Jimin looks up at her, Sunsoo is watching him with an odd expression. He squeaks when she suddenly reaches out and cups his cheeks, her eyes sweeping him over. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Jimin asks in confusion when she places her hands on his hips, and then over his stomach.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Sunsoo looks back up at him with shining eyes and a soft smile. \u201cBaby, I think you\u2019re pregnant.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Jimin stares at her. Did he just hear right? Did she just say\u2026</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201cWhat?\u201d He whispers, feeling his heart begin to pound in his chest. Could it really be?</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Sunsoo cups Jimin\u2019s belly, which has seemed a little chubbier lately, but he just thought it was from eating more food than usual. His mother smiles at him, so full of joy, and it feels like all the air is suddenly snatched from Jimin\u2019s lungs.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Is it possible? He\u2019s pregnant? With Yoongi\u2019s baby?</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Suddenly there are tears in Jimin\u2019s eyes and he\u2019s laughing breathlessly, looking down at his stomach. He places a hand over his belly as a tear leaks down his cheek. \u201cA baby,\u201d he breathes, not daring to believe it.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 All this time he\u2019d always talked about Yoongi breeding him, putting his pups in him, but somehow Jimin never actually thought about it happening for real. Now though, he wonders how he\u2019d never truly considered it. He\u2019s going to have a baby, the product of all his and Yoongi\u2019s long years of love, and he doesn\u2019t think he\u2019s ever been happier.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201cEomma,\u201d Jimin says, looking at Sunsoo with teary eyes. \u201cI\u2019m having a baby.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Sunsoo pulls him into a tight hug as Jimin cries in joy, kissing his hair and crying along with him. It will be her first grandchild, Jimin realizes, and he suspects that she\u2019s overcome with happiness.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 After a long time, Jimin finally calms down and gathers himself. He hugs Sunsoo tight before he takes off at a run in the direction of the poppy field. \u201cWhere are you going? What about Yoongi?\u201d She calls after him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201cTell him he knows where to find me!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Yoongi races through the forest, worried out of his mind. He\u2019d come back to camp to find Jimin missing and Sunsoo telling him to find him as fast as he can, saying Jimin said he knows where to find him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 With no idea what could possibly be wrong, Yoongi trips his way through the dark forest as the moon shines overhead. Finally, he catches a whiff of Jimin\u2019s scent and explodes into their secret meadow.<br>\nJimin is standing with his back to him amidst the swaying poppies, sealed closed for the night. The moon is shining down on him and turning his hair silver, and for a moment Yoongi is struck by how breathtaking his mate is.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201cJiminie?\u201d Yoongi calls cautiously, and when Jimin turns around and Yoongi sees that he\u2019s crying, alarm seizes him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 He races up to Jimin and cups his face in his hands, wiping away his tears. \u201cHeartling, what\u2019s wrong? What happened? Are you okay?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Then he realizes Jimin is smiling, a watery, tremulous thing, and Yoongi frowns in confusion. Jimin takes one of Yoongi\u2019s hands off his face and places it over his belly. \u201cHyung, we\u2019re having a baby,\u201d he whispers, and Yoongi\u2019s whole world stops.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Yoongi stares down at his hand on Jimin\u2019s belly, the material of his blue tunic bunching under his touch. His mouth feels like cotton and his heart starts beating rapidly in his chest. Did he hear Jimin correctly? Did he say...baby?</p>\n<p>\u00a0 The gears are turning in Yoongi\u2019s head. Jimin\u2019s heat had been five weeks ago, and omegas can only get pregnant during a heat. Jimin has looked different lately, a little softer around the edges, and his scent has taken on a softer, milkier tone. He\u2019s been sleeping fitfully and has been pickier about his food but Yoongi hadn\u2019t paid it any mind.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 It all adds up. Yoongi looks back up to see Jimin watching him with a soft smile. Yoongi places his other hand on Jimin\u2019s belly as well, his touch revernet as he stares at the omega, breathing fast. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have a baby?\u201d Yoongi whispers, and Jimin nods, smiling wider.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Yoongi doesn\u2019t realize he\u2019s crying until Jimin wipes away his tears and pulls him into a tight hug. Yoongi holds onto him like his life depends on it, breathing in Jimin\u2019s sweet, wonderful scent and feeling so overwhelmed with love for both his mate and their unborn child.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Somehow their hugging turns into slowly swaying together under the moon, the poppies brushing against their legs with the sound of the night time crickets as their music. Jimin is smiling into his neck, which is damp with the omega\u2019s tears, and Yoongi holds him close, wishing this moment could last forever.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0 The months leading up to the baby being born are filled with Jimin growing rounder and more adorable. His cheeks are extra chubby now and always flushed pink, and Yoongi just can\u2019t resist kissing them whenever he sees his mate. Jimin always has a hand on his belly, rubbing it with a soft smile on his face. He giggles sweetly whenever Yoongi kisses his bump and whispers to their baby that it\u2019s going to be the most loved little thing on the planet.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 At night, Jimin will sing lullabies to his belly while Yoongi rests his hand on it, feeling so warm at his mate\u2019s beautiful voice. Yoongi likes to press his ear against Jimin\u2019s belly and he swears he can hear their baby\u2019s heartbeat change whenever Jimin starts singing.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 The first time they feel it kick, they start crying again and it takes awhile for them to calm down. Yoongi can\u2019t seem to stop placing kisses all over Jimin\u2019s tummy, making the omega squeal with laughter and try to push him away.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 The whole pack is involved and they\u2019ve received so many handwoven baby clothes and hand-me-down supplies that they\u2019ll be set for awhile. Yoongi has taken to carving toys for it, much like the wolf he\u2019d carved Jimin as a courting gift. He makes a horse, a duck, and a turtle while Jimin sews together a little plushy out of fabric infused with both of their scents and stuffed with sheep\u2019s wool.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Finally, the time comes and Yoongi squeezes Jimin\u2019s hand through a long, difficult labor.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Then, Jimin is cradling their baby in his arms, a tiny little girl with a mop of dark hair. She\u2019s the most beautiful thing they\u2019ve ever seen and they both cry their eyes out when Sunsoo sets her in Jimin\u2019s arms.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201cHyung, look at her,\u201d Jimin sobs, running a delicate finger down their daughter\u2019s tiny nose. \u201cShe\u2019s so perfect.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Yoongi reaches out a hand and strokes her downy soft, raven black hair in reverence. She\u2019s a perfect blend between the two of them, with Jimin\u2019s pink little rosebud lips and the chubbiest cheeks, and Yoongi button nose and sleepy dark eyes. She wraps her impossibly small hand around Yoongi\u2019s fingers and holds tight, making little gurgling sounds that has Yoongi crying again. She smells like theirs too, a milky softness that absolutely melts Yoongi and turns him into a puddle. He\u2019s barely known her for two minutes and yet he already loves her with his entire being.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 They name her Hwayoung, beautiful flower, and she truly is their greatest gift. When she cries, Jimin starts singing the lullabies he\u2019d sing when she was in the womb, and she falls silent to listen. If anyone but the two of them try to hold her, she screams until she\u2019s back in their arms, nuzzling her little face into their necks and calming at their familiar scent.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 The more she grows, the chubbier she gets. Yoongi lovingly calls her his little dough of bread because of all her rolls, and he likes to nibble at them and make her squeal in laughter. Her mass of black hair is always standing on end from static, and her impossibly fat cheeks are always pink like Jimin\u2019s. She\u2019s only able to fall asleep at night with Jimin singing to her and each of their hands resting on her fat belly where she sleeps between them.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 She grows more beautiful and precious every passing day, and she\u2019s the darling of the pack. Everyone dotes on her and she has them all wrapped around her little finger, and she seems to know it, if the gleam in her mischievous eyes is anything to go by.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 A few months after her birth, Yoongi and Jimin takes her to the poppy field for the first time. They lay out a blanket and settle down next to her under the sunlight with the poppies swaying around them. She kicks her chubby legs in the air and gums happily on the wooden horse Yoongi had carved her, making content little baby sounds that melt Yoongi and Jimin\u2019s hearts. Jimin is watching Hwayoung with soft eyes as she gurgles to herself, and he reaches out to take Yoongi\u2019s hand.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 \u201cMy eomma would be so proud of her,\u201d he says quietly, for the first time in a long time allowing himself to think of the woman who gave birth to him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Yoongi squeezes his hand and leans carefully over their daughter to kiss Jimin softly on the lips. \u201cShe\u2019d be even more proud of you,\u201d Yoongi replies gently. \u201c<em>I\u2019m</em> proud of you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Jimin blinks back the tears prickling in his eyes and smiles when Yoongi kisses his nose. \u201cI love you, you know?\u201d Jimin whispers.</p>\n<p>\u00a0 Yoongi smiles down at him. \u201cI know.\u201d</p>"
