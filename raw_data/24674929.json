  "text": "<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou know, you\u2019re a surprisingly hard dude to track down, uh \u2013 being the Fire Lord and all.\u201d</p>\n<p>Zuko isn\u2019t used to hearing that title here. He looks up from the teapot in his hands, and tightens his grip as not to drop it.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d Iroh smiles, slowly moving his Pai Sho tile. \u201cNow this is unexpected. A wolf in sheep\u2019s clothing.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSokka,\u201d Zuko exhales, almost in disbelief.</p>\n<p>Sokka grins at him and plants his hands on his hips, taking a glance around the tea shop.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo <em>this </em>is where you\u2019ve been hiding. Playing hooky as a waiter seems like kind of a downgrade from <em>Fire Lord.</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>Zuko rounds the counter and almost laughs, pressing a finger to his lips and gesturing to the questioning patrons.</p>\n<p>\u201cSokka <em>shush.</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat, not even a hug?!\u201d</p>\n<p>Zuko grabs him and squeezes. Sokka hugs back harder, enough that Zuko feels it in his ribs. \u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cMan. It\u2019s been forever.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo shit, your hair is so long!\u201d</p>\n<p>Zuko steps back, and looks at Sokka\u2019s long wolftail. It\u2019s almost to his shoulders, and he\u2019s grown taller, just about eye level with Zuko.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo is yours. What are you doing in Ba Sing Se?\u201d</p>\n<p>Sokka pokes him hard in the sternum, \u201cLooking for <em>you! </em>Kinda\u2019 backwards, isn\u2019t it? Almost brings back memories.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMe?\u201d Zuko blinks.</p>\n<p>\u201cUh, yeah,\u201d Sokka says like he\u2019s stupid, and Zuko is almost distracted by how deep his voice has dropped. \u201cMister Sifu hotman, have you forgotten about a very important job you\u2019re supposed to be doing?\u201d</p>\n<p>Zuko rubs his neck sheepishly, and steps back towards the counter to do something with his hands.</p>\n<p>\u201cMy advisers know where I am.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, it would\u2019ve been nice to have a heads up before I took a flight all the way to the fire nation capital,\u201d Sokka huffs.</p>\n<p>Zuko heats a cup of tea and offers an apologetic look, \u201cUh yeah. Sorry about that, didn\u2019t know you were coming to visit. What has it been, two years?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTwo and a half,\u201d Sokka corrects.</p>\n<p>What does that make him? Twenty-one? Shit. That means Zuko turns twenty-three this year. <em>Double shit. </em></p>\n<p>Zuko sets the cup of tea at a customer\u2019s elbow, and lowers his voice. \u201cIs Aang with you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNah, he and Katara are still busy with their first kid.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d Iroh interjects, tapping his chin. \u201cLast I heard Katara was pregnant.\u201d Iroh looks to Zuko, \u201cYour move, nephew.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI got the letters,\u201d Zuko agrees, moving a random Pai Sho tile to satisfy his uncle. \u201cBut Aang hasn\u2019t brought the child by yet.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe probably won\u2019t for a while,\u201d Sokka laughs. \u201cHe\u2019s been freaking out over every little thing. It\u2019s driving my sister up a wall.\u201d</p>\n<p>Zuko snorts, \u201cDoes Bumi look like him?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNot at all. That kid\u2019s got a head of hair like a hogmonkey on a bad day.\u201d</p>\n<p>Zuko pauses to think about it, and then hums, \u201cWell. That\u2019s a picture.\u201d He looks to Sokka, who is leaning over one of the chairs to study the Pai Sho board. \u201cBut I\u2019m assuming you didn\u2019t come all the way here to talk to me about Aang\u2019s baby.\u201d</p>\n<p>Iroh moves a tile, and Sokka analyzes the board before making a move for Zuko. Iroh hums a surprised sound, and Sokka stands up straight, smiling.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, but we can talk about that later.\u201d He pushes up his arm bands, \u201cNeed help with the dishes?\u201d</p>\n<p>Zuko rolls his eyes, and sweeps his uncle\u2019s empty cup into the washbin.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd obviously \u2013 neither do you <em>Lord Zuko.</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>The patrons perk up like a flock of nosy lizard crows, and Zuko elbows him right in the ribs. Sokka sputters and laughs, but grabs a sponge and gets to scrubbing.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Sokka graciously helps them finish out the night\u2019s service, which is hardly an accomplishment. Like usual, it takes time to wave out the last few old bats clutching to their tea, and Zuko has to usher uncle back towards his home before it gets ridiculously late.</p>\n<p>\u201cDang,\u201d Sokka curses, wiping his hands on his pants. \u201cHow do you keep the lemons from burning the shit out of your hands?\u201d</p>\n<p>Zuko can see old weapon callouses and open cuts that mirror his own.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou don\u2019t,\u201d Zuko replies. He locks the door to the <em>Jasmine Dragon </em>and pockets the spare key. \u201cTake a walk with me?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh my, a romantic stroll through <em>Ba Sing Se </em>with the king of the fire nation?\u201d Sokka presses a hand to his chest and hops down the front steps. \u201cI\u2019m going to swoon.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cRomantic isn\u2019t really the word I\u2019d use,\u201d Zuko says, stepping in line with him. \u201cWatch your pockets.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sokka straightens a little, and Zuko starts down the path that leads to the center circle. Sokka follows behind him, looking up to the lanterns that burn past the road. He isn\u2019t wearing his typical water-tribe fur, likely because Ba Sing Se is quickly approaching spring, and the rock gets hot out here. Instead he\u2019s wearing neutrals; browns, and creams, as if he\u2019s trying to hide his heritage. If that\u2019s the truth, then he\u2019s doing a piss poor job at it, because the beads and the braids and the water-tribe choker are a dead giveaway.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy are you here?\u201d Zuko asks.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat? I can\u2019t just hunt you down across the planet for good times sakes?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou love sending a hawk so much, I figured I\u2019d never see your ass around here again.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHawkie is a very good and loyal operative of the Southern Water Tribe,\u201d Sokka lifts a finger. \u201cBut some things are best done in person.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCreative name,\u201d Zuko says flatly.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey! Don\u2019t slander Hawkie\u2019s good reputation like that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSeriously,\u201d Zuko cuts past the teasing. \u201cIs everything okay?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, yeah!\u201d Sokka reaches into his shirt and pulls out a scroll. \u201cDelivery for the grouch.\u201d Zuko takes it and lights a small flame on his fingers to read as they stroll.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis is\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSurprise!\u201d Sokka wiggles his fingers. \u201cYour water tribe ambassador is having a baby.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d Zuko blinks. Nuvua is pregnant? Zuko had no idea.</p>\n<p>\u201cCrazy, I know. Damn kids are popping up left and right around here since the peace started. The dad is a fire nation peon, kinda\u2019 scandalous, right?\u201d Sokka kicks at a rock and watches it skip down the road. \u201cAnyways, she\u2019s traveling back home for six months of maternity leave.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI see.\u201d Zuko closes the scroll. \u201cIs the Water Tribe sending a replacement?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUh yeah,\u201d Sokka gestures to himself dramatically. \u201cYou\u2019re looking at him.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d Zuko says, and then startles in shock. \u201cWait <em>what??\u201d </em></p>\n<p>\u201cMy room better be the peak of fire nation luxury, or I\u2019m going to make your life a living hell,\u201d Sokka continues. \u201cOh! Oh! I am <em>so </em>excited to get some of those popping candies. There are like, <em>no </em>traders that come down to the poles.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHold on,\u201d Zuko stops walking, and tries to process everything at once. He grabs Sokka by the shoulder to pull him back. \u201cSokka, you\u2019re supposed to be the next chief of your tribe. You can\u2019t live in the fire nation.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sokka looks at him strangely and says, \u201cHey, that title is my dad\u2019s for at <em>least </em>another five years, ten if we have it my way.\u201d</p>\n<p>Zuko gives him an equally skeptical look, \u201cBecoming chief is all you ever talk about. I thought\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, me too,\u201d Sokka nods, and keeps walking. Zuko falls in step with him again. \u201cBut I realized that it just wasn\u2019t right for me yet. My dad is an amazing chief \u2013 and the water tribe doesn\u2019t <em>need </em>me right now.\u201d Sokka looks at him, and it\u2019s like he\u2019s being seen right through. \u201cYou do.\u201d</p>\n<p>Shit. Zuko sighs, and rubs along the back of his neck. His hair is silky around his shoulders and down to his back, and Zuko sweeps back his bangs as they fall in his face.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo you\u2019ve heard.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat you\u2019re stressed out of your hot and spicy brains?\u201d Sokka huffs, and Zuko is surprised to find him angry. \u201cYeah, I\u2019ve heard. It sounds like some people aren\u2019t doing their fucking jobs.\u201d</p>\n<p>Zuko folds his hands into his haori, and sits on the lip of the center fountain. It\u2019s so late, that even the homeless have left to find refuge and sleep. The torches are burning tonight, and the yellow light clashes with the blue half-moon. Sokka sits next to him, and Zuko sighs.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not running away.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI know,\u201d Sokka nods. \u201cSo why are you here?\u201d</p>\n<p>Zuko stares at the fountain pool. Common koi fish swim in circles, and it reminds him of more fire nation sins. Sokka doesn\u2019t complain when Zuko takes a while to answer.</p>\n<p>\u201cSometimes,\u201d he starts, scratchy and low. \u201cWhen I\u2019m wearing that <em>stupid </em>robe\u2026\u201d Zuko swallows. \u201cI look in the mirror and see my father.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sokka\u2019s tight features soften, and he reaches over for Zuko\u2019s elbow.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>Zuko keeps to himself, and dips his fingers into the fountain, watching the koi scatter. \u201cMy biggest fear is losing my connection to the people. I get stuck in that palace for months at a time, constantly <em>arguing </em>for a better world, with people who want to live the way they always have.\u201d Zuko sizzles the water off his hand, and Sokka watches intently. \u201cWhen it feels like I\u2019m losing myself, I come back here. To remember what I\u2019m fighting for. To feel human again.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sokka clenches his fingers and turns away, bending over to balance his elbows on his knees.</p>\n<p>\u201cSpirits, you shouldn\u2019t fucking <em>have </em>to,\u201d Sokka snaps. Zuko looks to him in surprise, but Sokka just grits his teeth and continues, \u201cSome stuff is going to change over there, whether your council likes it or not \u2013 those crotchety old lizards can spit on me all they want.\u201d</p>\n<p>Zuko breathes a laugh out of his nose, and tries for a joking tone, even if it sounds flat anyways.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou know, I haven\u2019t approved your transfer yet.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sokka perks, \u201cOh? Are you seriously going to reject the son of the chief? You really <em>are </em>starved for drama.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI <em>could </em>say no,\u201d Zuko teases. \u201cCould request someone without such a big mouth.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s boring. I\u2019m going to kick my boot in there and tell \u2018em what\u2019s what.\u201d Sokka surprises him by placing a hand on his knee, and Zuko is even <em>more </em>startled at how at ease it makes him. \u201cZuko. I\u2019m sorry team Avatar has been AWOL, but I\u2019m not going to let you keep fighting this by yourself anymore.\u201d</p>\n<p>Zuko carefully plucks his hand off his lap.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s technically not in your job description.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, but if you look under my <em>best friend </em>credentials, you\u2019ll see it\u2019s all written in ink,\u201d Sokka offers up his palm like a scroll. \u201cSee? Right in the fine print.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re ridiculous,\u201d Zuko says.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe leave at dawn?\u201d Sokka offers.</p>\n<p>For once, Zuko doesn\u2019t feel sick about returning home.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ll take my ride,\u201d Zuko stands. \u201cIt\u2019s quicker than any air balloon.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cUhhhhhhh,\u201d Sokka drawls, looking up in the air. \u201cWas anyone going to tell me about the <em>dragon??\u201d </em></p>\n<p>\u201cI told Aang,\u201d Zuko placates.</p>\n<p>\u201cAang is now on my shit list,\u201d Sokka says. Druk lowers his head and breathes out a cloud of steam, and Sokka squeals and jerks backwards. \u201cH-Hey! Don\u2019t eat me! I\u2019m not delicious at all.\u201d</p>\n<p>Zuko pets his hand along Druk\u2019s neck, and the scales feel thick and leathery under his hand. Druk leans into him, and the muscle is strong, like metal. Druk has a calmer temperance for a dragon, and the way he\u2019s looking at Sokka is kind of hilarious. If a dragon could fuck with someone, he\u2019s definitely doing it now, slithering into Sokka\u2019s face just to watch him scramble in fear.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe won\u2019t eat you.\u201d Zuko hesitates. \u201cAs long as he\u2019s well fed.\u201d Another huff of steam, thick and ashy. Sokka hides behind his arm, and Druk begins to snarl as Sokka hovers over his sword hilt. \u201cUh, don\u2019t do that,\u201d Zuko adds, climbing on his back. \u201cHe hates weapons.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGood to know,\u201d Sokka swallows. \u201cHey, where are you going?!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHop on.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you for real?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDo I look like I\u2019m joking?\u201d</p>\n<p>Zuko has led them outside the wall, hopefully far away from any onlookers. It\u2019s not that Zuko actively hides Druk, he\u2019d just prefer not to start a panic. Sokka carefully climbs onto Druk\u2019s back, and settles in the back of the saddle.</p>\n<p>\u201cIf I die, you have to break the news to my sister.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t be dramatic,\u201d Zuko says, and then Sokka screeches as Druk takes off into the air. Zuko rolls his eyes and catches Sokka by the waist before he flies off the saddle. \u201cSeriously? You used to <em>live </em>on that sky bison\u2019s back.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe was <em>soft!\u201d </em>Sokka argues, getting his balance again. \u201cAnd there was a bigass basket on his back, and he never <em>flew this fast \u2013 fuck!\u201d </em></p>\n<p>The wind whips past them, and Druk flies in a slithery circle, up and down with the wind. It does take a little getting used to, and Zuko almost laughs when he sees Sokka\u2019s death grip on the saddle.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m going to tell Katara that you were a huge wimp about this,\u201d Zuko says.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis is ridiculous,\u201d Sokka huffs, red in the face. \u201cI thought there were only like, two dragons left. Where\u2019d you get one? Some sun warrior black market?\u201d</p>\n<p>Zuko turns to straddle Druk backwards, and watches Sokka have a small crisis about it. He settles his hands between them for balance and says, \u201cI was working on conservation efforts at the time. It took a couple months to fully outlaw the hunting of certain endangered species and whatnot. It was\u2026you know how some people feel about change.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cRight.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDruk found me in a time I needed him,\u201d Zuko says. Sokka seems to forget about his terror for a moment, because interest suddenly crosses his face.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo shit? Wow, Zuko the dragon tamer. Who woulda\u2019 thought?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNot me,\u201d Zuko agrees, and turns back around in the saddle. \u201cThe old masters only tolerate those they find worthy. If you don\u2019t pass judgement, then you\u2019re lunch.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sokka sputters, \u201cIt sure is nice of you to tell me that <em>now!!!\u201d </em></p>\n<p>\u201cI knew he\u2019d like you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sokka makes a series of sputtering sounds, but becomes quickly distracted by the sea of clouds Druk passes into. Zuko keeps sneaking looks, just to watch his face.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><em>Why are you really here?\u00a0 </em>Zuko thinks.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Sokka points to a cloud and laughs.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat one looks like a butt.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cHey uncle,\u201d Zuko whispered, kneeled at Iroh\u2019s bedside. \u201cI\u2019m returning to the fire nation.\u201d </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Iroh has lost some of the muscle he once had, but his eyes still hold a strong keenness in these seven years later. He rolled on his bed and sat up to cup the side of Zuko\u2019s face. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cI knew you\u2019d return when the time was right.\u201d </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cI\u2019ll miss you.\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u00a0Iroh took one look at him, and read his soul like usual. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cFollow your heart,\u201d Iroh said. \u201cIt will never lead you astray.\u201d </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cWhat if I can\u2019t trust my own heart?\u201d </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cWhen the time comes, you\u2019ll know what to do.\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Zuko scowled, because it\u2019s the exact answer he expected, and never the one he wants, but he still accepted Iroh\u2019s hug anyways. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u00a0</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Sokka settles into his quarters easily. It seems he\u2019s had more than enough time to wrap his head around the whole ambassador thing, but Zuko is still trying to keep up.</p>\n<p>The Fire Lord is bombarded with work the moment he steps back in the palace. The people are unaware that he ever left, and he knows it\u2019s taxing on his court to keep up appearances, but Zuko needed to get away. He was making decisions he wasn\u2019t proud of. He was becoming cold.</p>\n<p>Zuko is unable to meet with Sokka for a week and a half. He sends a guard for a wellness check, but that\u2019s the best he can do. Zuko is on the throne for two days straight, and it makes him so edgy and exhausted, that he can\u2019t even sleep when he tries. He hears out the issues that arose while he was gone, attempts to get caught back up on his paperwork, but falls more and more behind.</p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t even open the curtains \u2013 there is no time to bathe, and his eyes are red with exhaustion, and the candle at his elbow keeps flickering in the most infuriating way, and Zuko snuffs it out angrily.</p>\n<p>New technology patents are being made, and requests have been filed to pave new roads in the fire nation. Aang is still working on the treaties of Republic City even while in maternity leave, and Zuko has about a dozen missed letters from him. All his old legislature still needs to be reviewed and presented to the council and permits for the sun festival need to be completed by the end of the week and this room is too <em>stuffy, too hot \u2013 he can\u2019t breathe \u2013</em></p>\n<p>Zuko is too enraptured in his scrolls to register the noise at the door. When it persists, he starts to listen in.</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201c\u2014old you, this is the Fire Lord\u2019s royal study. You cannot enter without a permit.\u201d </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cDude, I don\u2019t give a shit about your permits. That\u2019s my friend in there.\u201d </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cThen please make an appointment with his secretary.\u201d </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cHis \u2018secretary\u2019 is a bunch of bullshit! He\u2019s booked out for the next YEAR.\u201d </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cThen you will have to return in \u2013\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>Zuko alerts to a heavy grunt, and the sound of metal hitting the floor. The door handle jiggles, and Zuko turns as Sokka sheepishly steps into the study and closes the door behind him.</p>\n<p>\u201cDid you just knock out my guards?\u201d Zuko asks, humored.</p>\n<p>\u201cUhhh, they\u2019ll come to in like, an hour,\u201d Sokka rubs his head. His sheepish expression quickly changes into fury. \u201cBut you. <em>You </em>mister, we need to have a talk.\u201d</p>\n<p>Zuko dully presses a finger to his chest, \u201cMe?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, you dumbass.\u201d Sokka counts off his pinky. \u201cFirst of all, I haven\u2019t seen you in <em>two weeks. </em>Second, you look like shit.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThird, you\u2019ve got some serious organizational issues, because you should NOT have a year long waiting list to meet with your own ambassadors.\u201d</p>\n<p>Zuko sighs, rubbing his eyes.</p>\n<p>\u201cI know, okay? There\u2019s just so many people I have to meet with right now \u2013\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat are you working on?\u201d Sokka points.</p>\n<p>\u201cUm. New curriculum for the schools. I tried to pass this a year ago but the pushback is insane. There is no way I\u2019m going to let my dad\u2019s old propaganda stay in our schools. We\u2019re poisoning our own children with bigotry, and it makes me sick.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sokka\u2019s anger shifts into something else. He looks around at the piles and piles of parchment and scrolls and heavy books, and he crosses his arms in disbelief. \u201cWow, Tui and La help you. Look at this damn place. You\u2019re going to bury yourself alive.\u201d</p>\n<p>Zuko grits his teeth and drags his nails through his hair, squeezing his eyes shut and barking, \u201cYou don\u2019t think I know that!\u201d</p>\n<p>Sokka\u2019s eyes widen, and he slowly approaches Zuko at his chair. He kneads a hand into his shoulder; a strong, certain grip.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey. It doesn\u2019t have to be like this. What you need is some help.\u201d \u00a0</p>\n<p>Zuko exhales. He can feel embers in his mouth, so he breathes them out before they catch fire.</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you honestly expect me to trust <em>anyone </em>to read these propositions before they reach me? I want to trust my own people, I really do \u2013 but there are too many snakes in my council, even after I replaced most of my father\u2019s old loyalists.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sokka hums in thought. Once again he kneads into the knots of Zuko\u2019s shoulders, and Zuko hasn\u2019t been <em>touched </em>by someone since \u2013 well, Mai, probably \u2013 and it\u2019s embarrassing that he\u2019s allowing this, but Sokka\u2019s presence is friendly, and Zuko permits his eyes to close as Sokka digs into a sore spot. Agni, that feels so good.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m going to think on this,\u201d Sokka says.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo way dude. You\u2019re going to kill yourself like this \u2013 then where will we be?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSokka\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCome on, grouchy.\u201d Sokka hauls him up from under his elbows, and Zuko goes stiff like a ferret cat. \u201cYou need to go to bed.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHey!!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh spirits, you stink.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat is so rude.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s the truth!\u201d Sokka is able to coddle him out the door, and there Zuko sees his two guards crumpled on the floor. \u201cAlright, baths first. Uhh, this way! You know I had to learn this place all by myself? I got lost <em>three times, </em>Zuko.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSorry about that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019ll make it up to me,\u201d Sokka says. \u201cBy using soap, goddamn.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhen I wake back up I\u2019m going to kick your ass,\u201d Zuko mumbles sleepily. As badly as he probably smells, Sokka actually smells good. Zuko can walk fine, but Sokka is insistent about keeping an arm around his shoulders, and he smells like lavender soap and washed cotton and pen ink.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Zuko wakes up <em>an entire day </em>later. He is absolutely stunned that anyone let him sleep this long. His assistant Lien approaches him with breakfast, and informs him that it is the thirteenth day of spring.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Shit,</em>\u201d Zuko curses, and the covers his mouth briefly, sitting up in bed. \u201cI mean \u2013 shoot, sorry. I have to complete the sun festival paperwork by tomorrow.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cActually, you don\u2019t,\u201d Sokka says, strolling right into his bedroom like he\u2019s been here a thousand times. \u201cHey Lien! Good morning.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHello, Ambassador Sokka,\u201d she bows.</p>\n<p>\u201cSee, I\u2019m learning names!\u201d Sokka beams proudly. \u201cThanks miss, I\u2019ll take it from here.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lien nods, \u201cI have left your itinerary with Ambassador Sokka as per your request.\u201d</p>\n<p>Zuko lifts his eyebrow, but allows her to exit before giving Sokka a look.</p>\n<p>\u201cPer my request?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s easier this way,\u201d Sokka flops his hand around and sits on the corner of his bed. Zuko is aware that he is very shirtless right now, but Sokka doesn\u2019t seem to care. \u201cSo, Lien told me all about your little sun festival. Well \u2013 <em>big </em>from what it sounds like \u2013 but anyways, it\u2019s complete bullshit that they have you doing <em>all </em>the work \u2013 \u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI requested it,\u201d Zuko interrupts, taking his tea from the tray. \u201cRemember?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThen you\u2019re also an idiot,\u201d Sokka says easily, and Zuko blinks through the insult. \u201cAnyways, I did some snooping around last night and uh \u2013 might\u2019ve come up with a plan in your place. What you <em>need </em>are some legitimate legal secretaries to read through and write your summaries. But like you said, you can\u2019t trust everyone, right?\u201d Sokka talks with his hands, \u201cSo what about a checks and balances system? Get a manager you trust to oversee your departments, and then all you have to do is see the final product and give it the yay or nay. We just have to find a selected few that you <em>do </em>trust.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s my problem, Sokka,\u201d Zuko sips. \u201cAs much as I want to believe in my people, I just can\u2019t trust them to not pull the rug out from under me.\u201d Zuko snarls to himself, \u201cNothing is worse than an <em>ignorant </em>leader.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s why we\u2019re going to pick some civilians you <em>do </em>trust.\u201d Sokka waves around a scroll. \u201cI\u2019ve got some candidates, and a few names of good people already in your court. Did you know Wenyan went to a legal school in the earth kingdom? Well-traveled, levelheaded; he wants peace just as you do.\u201d Sokka reads, \u201cHui was born a carpenter. She became the fire nation\u2019s first female judge by dressing as a man for six years. Uhhh, you should fire Tama though. He\u2019s definitely racist as hell.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAgreed, but Tama is the only man on my court that has the colony jurisdiction license,\u201d Zuko pinches his nose. He then looks up and stares. \u201cWait, how do you know all this?\u201d</p>\n<p>Sokka rolls his eyes, and stands to begin hunting through Zuko\u2019s closet.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve had nothing to do for the last two weeks while you were reading yourself blind. You can get places by like, actually talking to people you know.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLike I have time for that,\u201d Zuko mutters beneath his breath.</p>\n<p>\u201cI know, that\u2019s why we\u2019re going to have some interviews today,\u201d Sokka says, tossing him his robes. \u201cAnd then you\u2019re going to hire some little ducklings, and I\u2019m going to play warden until you hire someone better for the job.\u201d</p>\n<p>It\u2019s a handful to process, but unfortunately, Sokka is making sense. Zuko continues to stare long enough that Sokka gives him a <em>what??? </em>look.</p>\n<p>\u201cIf I didn\u2019t know better, I\u2019d say the water tribe was trying to take over my country from the inside.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh please,\u201d Sokka rolls his eyes. \u201cLike I\u2019d want this crapshoot. Your interior design is like, <em>so </em>two hundred years ago.\u201d</p>\n<p>Zuko pulls his arm into a clean sleeve, and ties the sash around his waist. His hair spools over his shoulder, and Sokka watches him intensely as he ties it up in a knot. A pause swells in the room\u2019s atmosphere; Zuko takes in Sokka\u2019s fire-nation attire, with his water-tribe accessories. His skin looks especially tan in those robes.</p>\n<p>\u201cSokka,\u201d Zuko calls. \u201cYou really don\u2019t have to do any of this.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sokka\u2019s eyes are sharp and ocean like. He looks Zuko over without a hint of humor, and turns towards the window nonchalantly.</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t think I\u2019m being completely charitable. The world relies on the fire nation\u2019s reform. If our supposed \u2018<em>peace\u2019 </em>gets corrupted along the way, then it was all for nothing.\u201d</p>\n<p>Zuko knows this. It plays in circles around his brain, like a mandolin with a broken string, off key and sharp in his ears.</p>\n<p>He looks in the mirror as he sets in his fire lord hairpin, and for a moment, it\u2019s his father\u2019s face staring back at him, and Zuko has to do his best not to flinch.</p>\n<p>\u201cRight,\u201d Zuko says. Sokka watches him \u2013 but says nothing. He grabs the scroll off the bed and points with it like a sword.</p>\n<p>\u201cOnward, to victory!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>In the end, the only paperwork that requires Zuko\u2019s signature is a single stack of permits for the sun festival. It\u2019s been written and refined to key points, and Zuko is able to read through the checklist before agreeing to hire on the usual performers and street vendors.</p>\n<p>\u201cI checked it all over,\u201d Sokka assures, sitting up on his desk like he belongs there. \u201cPretty solid, if I say so. It actually sounds fun as shit \u2013 maybe we could get the rest of the gang to come.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI haven\u2019t attended in a couple years,\u201d Zuko admits. \u201cI just make an appearance to start off the festivities.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sokka frowns, thumbing through a stack on his desk. \u201cThat\u2019s not right, man.\u201d</p>\n<p>Zuko shrugs, and continues to play with the fire in his fingers as he reads. It\u2019s silent for a bit longer, before Lien is at his door.</p>\n<p>\u201cFire Lord Zuko,\u201d she bows. \u201cYour appointment with the duchess is at the end of the hour.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNuh huh,\u201d Sokka interjects, holding up a hand before Lien can exit. \u201cHold on a sec. What about?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUm,\u201d Lien looks at her parchment pad. She\u2019s a young thing, and she does her best, so Zuko doesn\u2019t hark on her much. They\u2019re both figuring this out as they go. Lien skims her notes and looks back to Sokka, \u201cAbout the silk trade with the outer earth cities.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd?\u201d Sokka prods. Zuko looks up in interest.</p>\n<p>Lien swallows, \u201cAnd\u2026what?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHas Lord Zuko already met with this Duchess of whatever?\u201d</p>\n<p>Zuko cringes, because he hates when his friends call him that. Lien skims her notes again and nods, \u201cThis is a follow up meeting.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThen let Takeo take care of it,\u201d Sokka waves. \u201cHe worked as the head of the salt trade for fifteen years. If there are any problems, let him present it to the Fire Lord in his reports.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lien looks a little bewildered, but quickly takes note and nods.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes. I will oversee the meeting, Ambassador.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sokka winks, \u201cThanks! Make sure you eat lunch.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lien ducks out the door quickly with Zuko\u2019s approval. Zuko then sets his head in his hand, and looks up at Sokka still sitting on his desk.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re making me look like an idiot,\u201d Zuko says lightly. Sokka gapes, a stunned look on his face, before he whips his head back and laughs.</p>\n<p>\u201cShit, this is what I <em>do, </em>you know? I\u2019m kind of a strategist.\u201d Sokka pokes his arm. \u201cAnd you are too. You\u2019re just spread too fuckin\u2019 thin, you can\u2019t think right.\u201d Zuko feels a little hot as Sokka\u2019s stare grows more intense. \u201cI don\u2019t know if you see it, but the fire nation has already come a long way. You\u2019re kind of amazing, you know that right?\u201d</p>\n<p>Zuko\u2019s eyes widen; he stares back at a loss for words. Sokka looks to the stacked library wall and hums.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019ve taken this all on yourself. For so long I didn\u2019t even <em>know\u2026</em>\u201d Sokka trails off. \u201cEverything sounded so normal in your letters.\u201d For a moment, he almost looks guilty. Zuko can\u2019t let that stand.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t your burden,\u201d Zuko says gruffly. \u201c<em>My </em>ancestors put us in this mess. I need to make it right, even if it takes the rest of my life.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sokka looks to him. His constant mood swings between high energy teasing and sudden seriousness is enough to give Zuko whiplash.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s what makes you a good Fire Lord,\u201d Sokka says, and then proves his point by hopping off the desk and skipping over towards a crate of paperwork. \u201cOoh! These look like new legislation drafts!\u201d</p>\n<p>Zuko shakes off the weird tingling in his chest, and waves his hand around.</p>\n<p>\u201cKnock yourself out. I\u2019ve been too busy to finish any of the propositions.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sokka rubs his hands like he\u2019s about to indulge in a good meal.</p>\n<p>\u201cI think I will.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Thanks to Zuko\u2019s new schedule, he\u2019s able to meet with his ambassadors more frequently. He feels more informed about the worlds\u2019 affairs, which does some to eliminate the constant blanket of dread that falls on his back.</p>\n<p>Sokka keeps on top of his water-tribe duties, but also works as Zuko\u2019s right hand. He\u2019s a frequent visitor to his study now, reading through parliament on one of the floor pillows, tongue between his teeth and ink all over his face, and he\u2019s a massive distraction that Zuko can\u2019t bring himself to get rid of.</p>\n<p>For the first time this year, Zuko is able to take a walk through his mother\u2019s garden. The turtleduck chicks have already grown, and they waddle around and eat the flowers, much to the palace gardener\u2019s dismay.</p>\n<p>One duckling has decided that his sandal is a good snack, so Zuko picks it up by the shell and sets it back in the pond. The trees bring good shade from the heat; Zuko leans against the trunk and watches the turtleducks dip up and under the water.</p>\n<p>This place no longer hurts his heart like it used to. The breeze feels good on his skin, and Zuko closes his eyes against it.</p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t feel dread when Lien enters the garden.</p>\n<p>\u201cLord Zuko,\u201d Lien bows. \u201cThe education board has gathered for your meeting.\u201d</p>\n<p>Zuko straightens, and tucks a few wily strands into his bun.</p>\n<p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIf you hate it so much, why not wear it down?\u201d</p>\n<p>Zuko nearly has a freaking heart attack when Sokka appears behind him in the hall mirror. Zuko clenches his fist into his robe before he can firebend.</p>\n<p>\u201cSpirits, Sokka. I almost fried your ass.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou could <em>try,</em>\u201d Sokka says. He gestures to Zuko\u2019s reflection. \u201cYou always flinch when you pass yourself in the mirror. Why don\u2019t you just leave your hair down?\u201d</p>\n<p>Zuko burns a little with embarrassment. If Sokka has noticed in his short time here, does his staff just turn the other way?</p>\n<p>\u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d Zuko says. \u201cThen I\u2019d look even more like him.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sokka squints, and then shakes his head.</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t see it. I\u2019ve seen that bastard in the flesh, and you look nothing like him.\u201d Sokka squints further. \u201cI mean, the eyes, maybe, but his were so full of hate. You\u2019re just pretty.\u201d</p>\n<p>Zuko lifts the only eyebrow he has, \u201cIs that so.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI mean,\u201d Sokka flushes. \u201cYou\u2019re the Fire Lord. Who\u2019s going to give you shit about not wearing a crown?\u201d</p>\n<p>Zuko looks back to his reflection, and reaches up to the combs of the gold hairpin.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s\u2026tradition.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sokka steps up behind him. They really are eye level now. Sokka reaches up as well, and leans around his shoulder to watch as he pulls out the pin. Zuko\u2019s top knot unravels, and with it goes the twist in his chest. \u201cMake a new one.\u201d</p>\n<p>If Zuko wasn\u2019t so broad, so built and marked and war torn, he\u2019d almost say\u2026he looks like his mother. His eyes widen, and Sokka pins the comb to the front of his robes.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis definitely looks more like you,\u201d Sokka nods. \u201cThe fire nation could use a little more <em>informality</em> don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p>\n<p>Zuko half smiles, and turns to look him in the eye, \u201cA little more <em>you?</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>Sokka blinks away and folds his hands behind his back, meandering back down the hall.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to be late for the court hearing, mister Fire Lord sir.\u201d</p>\n<p>Zuko hums, and carefully watches Sokka as he scurries off, the tips of his ears all red.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>After the first spring month has passed, Sokka\u2019s presence in his study becomes a normal one. He\u2019s pretty sure the guards never forgave Sokka for the breaking and entering incident, but they\u2019re definitely not going to mention anything in front of the Fire Lord, so Sokka gets away with his bratty little teasing whenever he enters the room.</p>\n<p>Zuko is reading through a tax report when he realizes that the office has gone a little too quiet. He turns, and studies Sokka\u2019s shadow out of the corner of his eye. It\u2019s dark on that side of the room, and he looks completely enveloped in a scroll. Strands are slipping out of his wolf tail, and he\u2019s frowning with concentration.</p>\n<p>Zuko stands up to stretch, groaning when his back pops. The sun set an hour ago, which is likely why his eyes hurt so bad. He steps over book piles to light the lamps by hand, reaching up with a flame and illuminating the room.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s got you?\u201d Zuko asks.</p>\n<p>Sokka looks up through his lashes, and unfortunately, Zuko\u2019s chest flutters with it. His face is dead serious, a change from the man that was giggling in his office not an hour before.</p>\n<p>\u201cDid you write a proposal to annul the homosexuality ban?\u201d</p>\n<p>Zuko freezes. His throat swallows dry, and he immediately curses himself for ever opening his mouth. He looks away, towards the last lamp as he ignites the oil. Sokka\u2019s gaze is burning holes into his back, and Zuko is slow to find his words.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2026did.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p>\n<p>Jeez. Zuko sits on the edge of his chair and folds his fingers together. He\u2019s hesitant to look in Sokka\u2019s direction, afraid to find disgust written on his face.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s something not taught in schools anymore,\u201d Zuko starts. \u201cI only learned the truth from my uncle. The fire nation used to be accepting of all types of people \u2013 until Sozin took power and declared that same-sex relationships were against Agni\u2019s law.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sokka frowns, \u201cThen what is it doing back here?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve spent these years trying to unfuck my family\u2019s mess,\u201d Zuko scratches his scar idly. \u201cI wrote up the draft, but it got put on the backburner when more important matters came up.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sokka raises a dark eyebrow and looks back at the parchment.</p>\n<p>\u201cSeems pretty important to me,\u201d Sokka says. Zuko lets go of a breath he didn\u2019t know he was holding. Then, Sokka winds him again by asking, \u201cDo you like men, Zuko?\u201d</p>\n<p>He chokes on air, coughing for a moment and tapping his chest.</p>\n<p>\u201cWh-what? Where did you get that idea?\u201d</p>\n<p>Sokka strokes his scruffy chin, \u201cNo? Or maybe\u2026a friend was\u2026?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDo I <em>need </em>a reason to support human rights?\u201d Zuko argues, growing a little angry.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Sokka shrugs. He lifts up several more scrolls. \u201cI just \u2013 I\u2019ve been reading through your shitty handwriting for weeks now. You wouldn\u2019t have put so much love and care into writing up a proposal you weren\u2019t passionate about.\u201d Sokka points to a spot on the paper, \u201cI mean, you didn\u2019t even shorthand this. Which is infuriating, by the way \u2013 a lord should have neater handwriting.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em>Fuck. </em>\n</p>\n<p>Panicking, Zuko looks to the dark window, hoping to appear indifferent. He has no prior knowledge on what the water tribes are tolerant of. For all he knows, Zuko could throw their friendship out the door right now.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d Zuko mumbles. \u201cA hundred years of bigotry won\u2019t go away with a single law.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut it\u2019ll help,\u201d Sokka shrugs. \u201cYou didn\u2019t answer my question.\u201d</p>\n<p>\n<em>Do you like men? </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d Zuko answers, straight faced. \u201cHappy?\u201d</p>\n<p>Sokka stares, confused for a moment, before his brain runs back the conversation, and his eyes widen.</p>\n<p>\u201cExclusively?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>It\u2019s Sokka\u2019s turn to look away. Zuko almost feels a little sick with it. Sokka rubs his arms and stares off into the corner. His voice sounds unsure.</p>\n<p>\u201cBack home, nobody ever talks about that stuff. If you\u2019re, um\u2026different\u2026you\u2019re just supposed to keep it to yourself.\u201d</p>\n<p>That leaves a bad taste in Zuko\u2019s mouth. He scowls, and shuffles his papers back into a forced pile.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, now you know. Happy?\u201d Zuko scowls, \u201cRip that up, throw it away, I don\u2019t care \u2013\u201d</p>\n<p>Sokka hugs it to his chest protectively and shoots to his feet.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?? No way!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell if it makes you <em>uncomfortable \u2013</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t put words in my mouth!\u201d Sokka shouts roughly, and it shocks Zuko still. A very loud silence follows. Sokka looks uneasy, but furious at the same time. When he realizes that he\u2019s crushing the scroll, he carefully rolls it back up and slides it into the tube. \u201cI\u2019m going to look this over,\u201d Sokka says quieter. \u201cReword a couple things.\u201d</p>\n<p>Zuko inhales, and stomps down his surprise.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p>\n<p>Sokka licks across his lower lip. He looks pretty here, under the study firelight. Chiseled and handsome, but ultimately\u2026 yeah. Pretty.</p>\n<p>\u201cI was never able to\u2026\u201d Sokka starts, and then shakes his head. \u201cNo. I never <em>allowed </em>myself to entertain any thoughts like that. You know I really, <em>really </em>like girls. A lot. Like, so much.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUh huh,\u201d Zuko replies flatly.</p>\n<p>Sokka sinks back down onto the pillow, and suddenly that tall, six-foot man of a water tribe warrior is small again, setting his chin on his knees. His earrings jingle against the solid line of his jaw.</p>\n<p>\u201cI thought it was gross that I saw guys like that. I thought there was no way I was gay \u2013 I love women way too much. But\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>Zuko inhales when he figures out where Sokka is going with this. He looks lost, so Zuko crosses the room and sits down next to him on the nearby cushion.</p>\n<p>\u201cI know,\u201d Zuko says. \u201cEverything you\u2019re feeling \u2013 I\u2019ve been through it already.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSorry,\u201d Sokka laughs dryly, turning his head. \u201cIt\u2019s probably not the time to be having a sexuality crisis.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019d say it\u2019s the perfect time,\u201d Zuko shrugs. \u201cBetter late than never.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhen did you know?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhen?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHow old were you, I mean.\u201d</p>\n<p>Zuko scratches at his scar again and hums in thought.</p>\n<p>\u201cSixteen?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat!\u201d Sokka sits up. \u201cThat long ago?\u201d</p>\n<p>Zuko breathes a laugh out of his nose, and mirrors Sokka\u2019s position.</p>\n<p>\u201cMmm. It was one more trigger to all my teen angst \u2013 something I definitely didn\u2019t need while I was trying to regain my honor. But here we are, I guess.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDamn\u2026\u201d Sokka whispers. \u201cDid you meet someone?\u201d</p>\n<p>The sudden gentle atmosphere makes Zuko want to be honest. Still, he holds onto certain memories like they\u2019re sacred. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2026became well-traveled in the earth nation,\u201d Zuko mumbles. \u201cI learned much about myself.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAh.\u201d Sokka offers a smile, and then looks away. \u201cI want to wear that part of myself proudly, one day.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMe too,\u201d Zuko says.</p>\n<p>Sokka\u2019s eyes snap back. They remind him of the ice caves up north, chilling black-blue and crystal clear at the surface. He\u2019s really grown into his face \u2013 even the stubble on his chin.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m rewriting this,\u201d Sokka says, gesturing with the tube. \u201cLet\u2019s meet next week on it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Zuko squirms, sitting back on his hands.</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you sure now is the time? I mean \u2013 with United Republic as fresh as it is \u2013 our hands are really full with \u2013\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNow is the <em>perfect </em>time,\u201d Sokka barks. \u201cThe fire nation is going to set an example for the world. Isn\u2019t that what you want?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cA good influence?\u201d A pause. \u201cYou know the world won\u2019t see it that way.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut the history books will.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>And that\u2019s enough.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThank you for gathering on such short notice,\u201d Zuko begins, elevated on the throne. \u201cAnd I thank and acknowledge the scribes that will be delivering my message to the Fire Nation.\u201d</p>\n<p>Twenty people are gathered in the room \u2013 twenty-one, plus Sokka in the back.</p>\n<p>With Sokka\u2019s help, Zuko was able to rewrite the proclamation quickly. It will go into practice immediately, without any legal loopholes. \u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAfter today, another sin of the Fire Nation will be wiped clean,\u201d Zuko says. His newer council members perk up with interest, while the elders seem to stare skeptically. \u201cWe\u2019re a strong and proud country,\u201d Zuko says, \u201cOne that will be inciting peace and kindness into the world. But we have many offenses to acknowledge and atone for, and one of those will begin today.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sokka nods excitedly from the back of the room. Zuko keeps his head raised and his resolve firm.</p>\n<p>\u201cI am declaring the ninetieth decree as formally abolished.\u201d</p>\n<p>There are no outbursts, but there might as well be. Tight body language, surprised side-eyes, straight backs and an obvious discomfort. Not all, but some, and Zuko sees them from his throne.</p>\n<p>\u201cIf you have an issue with this, you are within your rights to challenge me to an Angi Kai,\u201d Zuko says. A dead silence falls on the room and yeah, that\u2019s what he thought. Zuko sums up the meeting by saying, \u201cAny acts of violence towards these people will no longer be tolerated. Thank you for your time today.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you prepared for the backlash?\u201d Sokka asks later, when he catches up with him in the hall.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt will be nothing I haven\u2019t faced before,\u201d Zuko admits.</p>\n<p>\u201cGood answer,\u201d Sokka grins, and slaps him on the back. \u201cLoved that bit about the Agni Kai. I think you had them shitting their pants.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sokka doesn\u2019t treat him any differently since their little heart to heart in his study, but Zuko has continually felt stranger. Sokka squeezes into his shoulder and sways his weight and he still smells really good and <em>no. We are not doing this. </em></p>\n<p>Sokka looks at him, expecting a reply to something he must\u2019ve said but all Zuko hears is <em>eyes, eyes, eyes \u2013 lashes, knees, lips parted hands in his mouth aaan</em>~d that\u2019s not a good sign, is it? Probably not. Dang.</p>\n<p>\u201cMm,\u201d Zuko answers to something.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s the spirit!\u201d Sokka pats his back. \u201cGrab a robe and I\u2019ll meet you at the back entrance.\u201d</p>\n<p>Oh no.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>In his moment of weakness, Sokka convinces him to throw on a hooded robe and sneak out to the cart vendors, where they sell roasted peanuts and popping candy. Sokka keeps opening his mouth to hear the sizzle, and laughing when he can still hear it past his lips.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis stuff is the best,\u201d Sokka fizzles.</p>\n<p>Zuko slips a candied cashew into his mouth, and is careful to keep his scar hidden behind his hair.</p>\n<p>\u201cIf I get spotted here, all hell is going to break loose.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPsssh, it\u2019s fine,\u201d Sokka drags him to a booth of jewelry. \u201cNo one is going to anticipate the <em>Fire Lord </em>walking around a street market.\u201d</p>\n<p>The seller looks up, and Zuko shifts aside, whispering.</p>\n<p>\u201cHoly shit Sokka, can you be any louder?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p>\n<p>Zuko sighs, and bites a cashew in half with his teeth.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe have an entire room full of work we need to be doing.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHey, Sokka Word of Wisdom number three-oh-five,\u201d Sokka jabs his finger in his arm. \u201cTake a break <em>before </em>you have a mental breakdown, and you won\u2019t have one.\u201d</p>\n<p>Zuko scowls and slaps his hand away.</p>\n<p>\u201cKnow it all.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cStuck up,\u201d Sokka counters. He holds up a pair of beaded earrings adorned in fire nation colors. \u201cHow do I look?\u201d</p>\n<p>Zuko looks him over, and then says truthfully, \u201cIt clashes with your eyes.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sokka scoffs and sets down the earrings.</p>\n<p>\u201cRude. Now I\u2019m not going to share any of my candy with you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe candy <em>I </em>bought?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI paid for it!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd I pay you,\u201d Zuko says, sticking his hand in Sokka\u2019s bag before he can yank it away. Sokka is fast but Zuko is faster, and then Sokka is looking scandalized as Zuko opens his mouth to show off the noise of the candy. \u201cHa.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBad fire lord, bad!\u201d Sokka wags his finger like an animal. Zuko continues to open and close his mouth from the candy like fsssss, fssss \u2013 and hey, this is actually kind of \u2013</p>\n<p><em>No. </em>This is not fun. Zuko is not having fun. He\u2019s having a terrible time.</p>\n<p>\u201cWait!\u201d Sokka yanks him by the wrist, \u201cThose are feather arrows.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p>\n<p>Sokka bounces up to the stall, not at all appropriate for a man of his size or stature, and it\u2019s cute.</p>\n<p>\u201cExcuse me? Are you water tribe?\u201d</p>\n<p>The man at the stall looks confused for a moment, before he looks Sokka over and grins, gesturing to his pendant.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes sir. I have permits to sell in the city.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMe too! My father is Hakoda.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh! It\u2019s an honor to meet you, sir.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSokka is fine!\u201d He points to a row of arrows and beams, \u201cZuko, look! These are traditional arrowheads, like they have back home.\u201d</p>\n<p>Zuko flinches at the sound of his name, and the shop owner looks him over, but decides to keep his mouth shut. Zuko sighs internally. Sokka shows him an arrow, and Zuko studies the adornments.</p>\n<p>\u201cThese are beautiful.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cRight?\u201d Sokka tips his head, \u201cHow do you fare selling when metal arrows are so popular over here?\u201d</p>\n<p>The owner shrugs, \u201cIt\u2019s mostly a keepsake. Fire nation folk haven\u2019t traveled much out of the country, unless you\u2019re a solider. They find our traditions interesting.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sokka seems a little disappointed at the answer, but his smile doesn\u2019t wane. Zuko hasn\u2019t put much thought into how homesick he must be, so he lets Sokka talk as long as he wants, and against his own judgement, he doesn\u2019t wander off either.</p>\n<p>Sokka\u2019s face lights up when he\u2019s excited about something. Zuko can\u2019t look away.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He\u2019s busy for seven days, but rests on the eighth. Zuko bathes that morning, combs his hair and walks to his mother\u2019s garden without thinking. His brain is full of too many thoughts, and he welcomes the distraction.</p>\n<p>Yesterday he asked for a light summary on the public\u2019s reaction to the new law. Opinions were mixed, which is probably the best Zuko could ask for. Maybe it\u2019ll distract them from the entirely new school curriculum.</p>\n<p>At times like these, Zuko wishes he could call his uncle. Whispers of a new technology catch his ear from time to time, but after hearing the patents, Zuko estimates that it will be years until that kind of technology is fully functioning. For now, hawks will do.</p>\n<p>Zuko pauses past one of the windows. A silhouette catches his eye, and he backpedals when he spots Sokka sitting on the veranda, staring at the ocean.</p>\n<p>His hair is down. It\u2019s layered, a little wavy from the summer humidity, and it doesn\u2019t look right to see him be\u2026alone.</p>\n<p>Zuko opens the door silently. Sokka twitches, immediately aware of his presence.</p>\n<p>\u201cMy lord,\u201d Sokka bows his head, mocking.</p>\n<p>\u201cStop that,\u201d Zuko snaps, and then sits.</p>\n<p>You can taste the sea salt up here; not always, only in monsoon season when the heat brings water off the ocean. Heat and water are two elements that always appear to be at odds \u2013 but without their cooperation, there would be no rain, no flowers or trees. It was a wisdom that uncle always tried to instill in him, but the dragons really <em>proved </em>at last.</p>\n<p>\u201cFeels nice up here,\u201d Sokka says, closing his eyes. \u201cWe\u2019ve been nonstop lately.\u201d</p>\n<p>Zuko hums.</p>\n<p>\u201cFeeling homesick?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cEh?\u201d Sokka shrugs. \u201cNot really. I mean, I\u2019ve left home for years at a time.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut you were always on the move,\u201d Zuko says. \u201cYou don\u2019t come off as the kind of person that likes to be tied down.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sokka grins toothily, \u201cAm I that obvious?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou know \u2013 you don\u2019t have to stay. If you asked to leave, I\u2019d end your contract\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThings are changing,\u201d Sokka says, eyes trained on the ocean. \u201cThat\u2019s why I like it here.\u201d</p>\n<p>Zuko isn\u2019t sure how to respond to that. He watches the wind blow Sokka\u2019s hair away from his tan, unmarked nape, and blurts without thinking.</p>\n<p>\u201cWant to spar?\u201d</p>\n<p>Sokka looks at him skeptically.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo jerkbending?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sokka thinks it through, and then hops to his feet with no reserve.</p>\n<p>\u201cAlright, but no cheating.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI would never,\u201d Zuko says, scandalized, and then throws Sokka flat on his back in the middle of the training room.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou are literally such a cheater!\u201d Sokka pants, winded. His practice sword has been kicked across the room, and Zuko plants his dual swords into the wood by Sokka\u2019s head. \u201cIf I had my boomerang you\u2019d be dead!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cConcussed, maybe,\u201d Zuko admits, sitting on his thighs. \u201cMildly inconvenienced at the most.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sokka twists a leg and an arm around him and flips Zuko with his core strength. Zuko grunts as his shoulders hit the mat, and all of Sokka\u2019s weight hovers over him.</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t underestimate the power of my boomerang.\u201d Strands of hair are falling out of his hair-tie, and this isn\u2019t a situation Zuko should be in right now, so Zuko reaches up to pull on a strand.</p>\n<p>\u201cCome on, let\u2019s go again.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sokka wields the sword with a two-handed refinement. \u00a0Zuko is faster, because his swords are lightweight and two halves of a whole, but Sokka\u2019s hits hurt more (when he <em>does </em>land them). They\u2019re dull swords after all; couldn\u2019t much cut paper, let alone skin, but Zuko feels the intent behind it.</p>\n<p>Sokka is interesting to watch. He\u2019s long been aware that Sokka trained under Master Piandao as well \u2013 but Sokka took his lessons and added his own style to it. He might\u2019ve been sloppy in his younger years, but he\u2019s grown now, battle hardened and more confident in his strikes. Here \u2013 in this training room \u2013they\u2019re not a <em>fire lord </em>and an <em>ambassador; </em>they\u2019re equals.</p>\n<p>Zuko still wins.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou are <em>infuriating!\u201d </em>Sokka wails.</p>\n<p>Zuko sits on his back and holds him down by the neck.</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you yield?\u201d</p>\n<p>Sokka squirms, and Zuko tests his hold, shifting more of his weight on his hips. Sokka freezes, and then goes limp entirely.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes yes yes, I yield \u2013 <em>let go.</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>Zuko hums and sits off his back. Sokka rolls over and coughs into his elbow.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna\u2019 get you next time,\u201d Sokka threatens. His face is red from the exertion, and it makes Zuko feel things he shouldn\u2019t.</p>\n<p>\u201cMmm. You got me good with that sweep.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh don\u2019t treat me like a kid,\u201d Sokka points with his sword, but quickly turns away again. \u201cI\u2019m taking a bath, shit.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHey,\u201d Zuko calls, frowning. \u201cYou\u2019re not actually mad, are you?\u201d</p>\n<p>Sokka hesitates at the door of the dojo, and turns partway with a smile.</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course not, stupid. My shoulder fuckin\u2019 hurts though, I\u2019m mad about that for sure.\u201d \u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSorry,\u201d Zuko rises, dusting off his pants. \u201cAnd you probably shouldn\u2019t call the fire lord stupid. There are guards around.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sokka deeply rolls his eyes, \u201cOh <em>now </em>you\u2019re pulling rank?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhen it\u2019s convenient to me,\u201d Zuko smiles toothily.</p>\n<p>Sokka stares at him. A moment passes by, almost uncomfortably, but Zuko can\u2019t bring himself to look away. Sokka is looking <em>into </em>him, like he\u2019s a puzzle he can\u2019t solve. Sokka breaks the moment by shaking his head, mumbling something to himself and turning back down the hallway.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou owe me dinner!\u201d Sokka calls.</p>\n<p>Zuko sheaths his sword and raises his voice so Sokka will hear him.</p>\n<p>\u201cIf you bother to show up.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He does, and for once, Zuko doesn\u2019t have to eat alone.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Druk is free to come and go as he pleases. They have a connection that Zuko can\u2019t explain yet \u2013\u00a0 and it sounds dumb on paper, but Zuko knows when his dragon is near. His neck tingles, and he feels antsy, and he can hear the shift of the roof as Druk lands.</p>\n<p>So Zuko forgoes an evening of paperwork to sit on the hill outside the palace; he run his hands up and down the sides of Druk\u2019s heavy muzzle, and it\u2019s comforting. Druk\u2019s purring is more of a small tremble than a purr, but Zuko can hear it anyways.</p>\n<p>\u201cIf I asked you to pass on a message to uncle, would you do that for me?\u201d Zuko asks.</p>\n<p>Druk looks through him. Zuko knows he understands, so he closes his eyes and rests his head against Druk\u2019s jaw.</p>\n<p>\u201cI never feel like I\u2019m doing the right thing,\u201d Zuko says, slipping a letter into the gap in one of Druk\u2019s scales. \u201cBut with this\u2026with Sokka\u2026\u201d Zuko sighs. \u201cI just keep digging a bigger hole. Whatever I\u2019m hoping for \u2013 it won\u2019t work out. I know it, but I can\u2019t stop myself either way.\u201d</p>\n<p>Druk shifts his wings, spreads them out and open, stretches and then folds them again. Zuko pats along his horn, and a massive eye blinks open at him.</p>\n<p>\u201cHuman problems,\u201d Zuko explains. \u201cTrivial, I know.\u201d</p>\n<p>Druk can\u2019t speak, but Zuko understands him somehow. It\u2019s not words, but a feeling he\u2019s trying to project.</p>\n<p>\n<em>Comfort comfort comfort. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Zuko says. When it\u2019s time for him to leave, Druk lets steam fall from his mouth, and wind picks up as his mighty red wings carry him off towards the earth kingdom.</p>\n<p>It really is a sinking feeling; something that gets worse and worse with these passing weeks, like a snowball rolling down a hill. He must be sick.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Zuko sits on the grass of the hill and presses his knuckles into his eyes.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em>I like Sokka. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u00a0</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u00a0</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat is this?\u201d Sokka asks.</p>\n<p>One look, and then Zuko turns back to his desk.</p>\n<p>\u201cGarbage.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUhh, dude,\u201d Sokka waves the parchment around. \u201cThis is a marriage proposal.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGarbage,\u201d Zuko repeats.</p>\n<p>Sokka frowns at the fine writing and leans his hip up against the desk. He braided his hair today, threaded it with fire nation beads and blue string, and it looks masculine and feminine at the same time \u2013 and it\u2019s so distracting, that Zuko can\u2019t stop staring at the nape of his neck.</p>\n<p>\u201cIs your council already trying to marry you off?\u201d</p>\n<p>Ughhh. This isn\u2019t the conversation Zuko wanted to have today. He forcefully pushes away from his desk and scowls.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes. Technically I should have married two years ago, but I\u2019m stalling for time right now because I <em>really </em>don\u2019t have the mind to think about a family.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cA family,\u201d Sokka repeats, looking a little pale. \u201cThat\u2019s right. You have to make like, little fire babies.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIf my council had it their way, yeah,\u201d Zuko huffs.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhen\u2026do you think your deadline is?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUh, I dunno\u2019. Max a year, before I really start causing problems.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sokka stares at the paper, and then rolls it up neatly and sticks it back in the tube.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m going for a walk.\u201d</p>\n<p>Zuko tips his head.</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFine,\u201d Sokka waves flippantly. \u201cDon\u2019t forget about your three-o-clock.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI won\u2019t,\u201d Zuko says. The door slams a little too loudly, and Zuko is left feeling strange. He shifts the tube off his desk and into the waste bin. He\u2019ll tell Lein to send a letter of rejection later.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Zuko passes Sokka in the dojo that night, on his way to the baths. He\u2019s going at a wooden dummy with a great amount of concentration, sword flipping around his hands in a way that\u2019s almost methodical, and Zuko chooses not to bother him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cKnock knock, pep pep, cheerio,\u201d Sokka greets first thing in the morning, throwing open his door with vigor.</p>\n<p>\u201cUgh.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou have a Republic council meeting this morning.\u201d</p>\n<p>Zuko yawns, \u201cAang?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNah, he sent a messenger with a letter,\u201d Sokka waves a paper.</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you sitting in?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re building a self-functioning colony without single nation jurisdiction,\u201d Sokka says. \u201cOf course I\u2019m going to be there! This is history.\u201d</p>\n<p>Zuko sighs and rubs the sleep out of his eyes, \u201cThen you get to answer all the stupid questions.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSorry man, unfortunately that\u2019s your job.\u201d Sokka looks at him a moment, and then tips his head, \u201cDidn\u2019t sleep?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI need to look at your itinerary,\u201d Sokka mumbles, systematically grabbing Zuko\u2019s robe and helping him dress without thinking. \u201cThere\u2019s something I\u2019m over looking\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>Zuko sticks in an arm and stops Sokka by the shoulder.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s nothing you\u2019re doing,\u201d Zuko says. Sokka stares, and Zuko drops his hand quickly. \u201cCome on, lets go.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>If Zuko is spread too thin, then Sokka is a different species completely. He listens and contributes actively through the meeting, but he\u2019s always writing down separate notes and reading scrolls entirely unrelated to the conversation.</p>\n<p>Sokka is a hard worker. Zuko always knew this \u2013 but to see it up close is different. Is this how Sokka acts back home? Does he work six times harder to please his own father?</p>\n<p>Zuko\u2019s line of thought flows into one inevitable place; Sokka really will be a great chief one day.</p>\n<p>The meeting is long over, but Sokka is still reading through a stack of papers with dramatic intensity. Zuko crosses one leg over the other, and leans on the arm of the throne.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou look like you\u2019re trying to firebend with your eyes.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHm,\u201d Sokka answers. His head then jerks up, \u201cWait, can you do that?!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to tell you. What are you reading?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI found your secret stash,\u201d Sokka frowns, waving a pile of papers. \u201cIt\u2019s taken me an entire week to sort through these \u2013 thanks to you, sneaky pants.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUh, stash\u2026?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Sokka huffs. \u201cAll the marriage proposals you\u2019ve been shoving behind the bookcase.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAh,\u201d Zuko blinks. \u201cThat stash.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI know you said they\u2019ve been urging you to marry\u2026\u201d Sokka gestures to the pile in his lap, \u201cBut this is ridiculous! Why haven\u2019t you told me about this?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI told you the other day.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah! <em>The other day!</em>\u201d Sokka barks. Zuko isn\u2019t quite following, and Sokka yanks on the back of his ponytail in frustration, before looking back to Zuko at the end of the meeting table. \u201cYour council has courted hundreds, <em>literally hundreds, </em>of women for you to marry. They\u2019ve even entertained the thought of a harem just to preserve your bloodline.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThrow those away,\u201d Zuko stands. \u201cIt\u2019s not my concern right now.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHow the hell is it not your concern?\u201d</p>\n<p>Zuko studies his expression, and answers with another question, \u201cAre there no arranged marriages in the water tribe?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI mean\u2026in the north, but not where I come from.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI have other duties to attend to,\u201d Zuko says. \u201cIn case you weren\u2019t listening, we\u2019re moving forward with the construction of a meeting house in Republic City.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI know, I heard,\u201d Sokka grits. \u201cBut Zuko, what about <em>your </em>happiness?\u201d</p>\n<p>Zuko pauses.</p>\n<p>\n<em>That\u2019s what Sokka is worked up about? </em>\n</p>\n<p>The expression on his face is earnest \u2013 and maybe\u2026maybe a little na\u00efve, in the good kind of way. It makes Zuko\u2019s heart ache, makes him want to reach forward and grab his face in his hands. He thinks of wolf face paint, wonders what it\u2019d be like to smear it around those blue eyes.</p>\n<p>\u201cMy happiness isn\u2019t important,\u201d Zuko says. \u201cAnd it\u2019s not your concern. Let\u2019s focus on our current projects before we get involved in anything else.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sokka seems to deflate before his eyes. The openness in his expression walls away, and his answer is professional and curt.</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p>\n<p>Zuko is weak, so he squeezes Sokka\u2019s shoulder as he passes by.</p>\n<p>\u201cThank you for your hard work.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sokka doesn\u2019t reply. He doesn\u2019t throw out the scrolls, either.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Mother\u2019s garden glows purple at night. It must have something to do with the blue reflection of the moon, the green grass and the white lilies \u2013 but it feels more sacred than that.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re supposed to be sleeping.\u201d</p>\n<p>Zuko heard the footsteps, so he doesn\u2019t startle when Sokka sits next to him. He sent the guards away for a sense of peace, but Zuko\u2019s heart is in turmoil all the same.</p>\n<p>\u201cWasn\u2019t tired,\u201d Zuko replies.</p>\n<p>Sokka is in white sleeping attire, and they look blue and purple with the rest of the garden \u2013 usually full of pinks and greens, it\u2019s a quiet atmosphere.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou just got back from Republic City,\u201d Sokka points out. His voice is rough.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt was only a day trip.\u201d Zuko looks him over, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you?\u201d</p>\n<p>Sokka snorts, \u201cYou have such a way with words, Zuko.\u201d</p>\n<p>Zuko rolls his eyes, \u201cI\u2019m just saying you look tired.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNow you\u2019re insulting my good looks? That\u2019s no way to treat a lady.\u201d</p>\n<p>Zuko pushes at his shoulder, and Sokka sways over and back with a laugh.</p>\n<p>\u201cSokka.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSame as you, probably,\u201d Sokka answers, leaning up against the same tree. \u201cThinking.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHmm. So you <em>are</em> capable.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI will karate chop you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGood luck,\u201d Zuko replies. Sokka puffs another laugh, and an easy silence follows.</p>\n<p>If you were to press him, really, between a rock and a hard place \u2013 Zuko would say he missed these moments. He was never the lone wolf he took claim to; be it mother, uncle, or the avatar gang, Zuko has never truly been alone. These years as the Fire Lord have been full of progress, but lonely all the same. He misses the tea shop again.</p>\n<p>\u201cStop that,\u201d Sokka says. Zuko pauses, his fingers scratching at his scar.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cStop scratching that.\u201d Sokka takes his hand and pulls it down to his lap. \u201cYou just make it all puffy the next day.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d Zuko stares at the sleeping ducks on the pond. \u201cDo I?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Yes. </em>So stop.\u201d Sokka\u2019s expression is unreadable in this light. Zuko\u2019s face still itches, so he rubs his shoulder along his cheek, and it kind of helps. Sokka watches him, and asks, \u201cAfter all these years, it still bugs you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt gets tight,\u201d Zuko explains. \u201cThe burn was all the way to the bone. I was supposed to lose this eye, but...it\u2019s mostly blind anyways.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Sokka\u2019s soft inhale is barely audible. He lets it go, and folds a leg up, the other stretching outwards.</p>\n<p>\u201cTraining accident?\u201d</p>\n<p>Zuko stares. His stomach churns with anxiety.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHuh?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI guess that makes sense,\u201d Zuko mumbles, thunking his head back on the tree trunk. \u201cIt was shameful to the fire nation.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat the hell are you talking about?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe burn was a punishment from my father,\u201d Zuko explains. Sokka jerks to look at him, face fallen in surprise; his voice cracks.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?! Are you serious?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes?\u201d Zuko lifts his eyebrow. \u201cI was invited to a war meeting. I spoke out against a general\u2019s suggestion to sacrifice our own people, and in doing so, I dishonored my father.\u201d Zuko\u2019s voice gets a little tight, and he clears his throat. \u201cI was reprimanded in an Angi Kai.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sokka\u2019s eyes don\u2019t look like his own; they are wild with anger and <em>dark, </em>furious.</p>\n<p>\u201cYour father challenged you to an Angi Kai.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI begged for forgiveness,\u201d Zuko explains. \u201cI refused to fight and tarnished the family name.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sokka swallows, and his head clunks back on the tree also.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat prison is he at?\u201d</p>\n<p>Zuko laughs under his breath, \u201cI\u2019m not going to tell you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHey, I\u2019m just looking for a friendly conversation,\u201d Sokka says, and while his words are light, his tone is irate. \u201cWith my boot.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI found my peace with it,\u201d says Zuko. \u201cBut not before hunting the avatar halfway around the world and taking out my aggression on every poor soul who passed my way.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou just wanted your family\u2019s acceptance,\u201d Sokka mumbles. \u201cBanished at what, thirteen? Damn, I want to fucking kill that guy.\u201d</p>\n<p>Zuko shrugs.</p>\n<p>\u201cMe too, sometimes.\u201d</p>\n<p>Another silence follows, but this one is different. Zuko can almost hear Sokka thinking, can see him chewing on his lips and his knuckles. His mouth looks soft. Zuko turns the other way.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou know\u2026\u201d Sokka starts. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t always easy. The fire nation made my tribe\u2019s life hell.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cRight.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut I\u2019ve been happy,\u201d Sokka explains. \u201cI\u2019ve met people \u2013 friends, partners and whatever. And I always had my dad and my sister, even in the war. Even when we were apart, you know?\u201d Zuko nods, and Sokka continues in a voice too soft for him. \u201cI used to think you were a spoiled prince, but I had it all wrong. Now the nation wants to marry you off to some \u2013 some random girl! Just to pump out heirs!\u201d</p>\n<p>Zuko flinches, and combs through his hair with his fingers.</p>\n<p>\u201cI told you not to think about that stuff anymore.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI can\u2019t help it,\u201d Sokka turns, and Zuko is surprised to suddenly find him up in his face. \u201cI don\u2019t care what anyone says. <em>You deserve to be happy!\u201d </em></p>\n<p>Zuko\u2019s eyes are round like dinner plates. He feels like a fist has punched through his chest.</p>\n<p>\u201cSokka\u2026\u201d He starts. \u201cIt\u2019s \u2013 I know I haven\u2019t thanked you much, but things are already better because of you. When you return to the southern water tribe I don\u2019t want you to worry \u2013\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut I <em>will,</em>\u201d Sokka barks, his fingers tightening in Zuko\u2019s sleeves. \u201cBecause you work and you work and you never see how far you\u2019ve come because you\u2019re always staring five steps ahead, tripping over your own damn feet.\u201d Sokka swallows, and then strengthens his resolve. \u201cZuko, I\u2019ve been here for four months.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not useless without you,\u201d Zuko argues. \u201cI\u2019m not a child anymore.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI know,\u201d Sokka grits, and fists his grip into the front of Zuko\u2019s robe. \u201cThat\u2019s why I don\u2019t want you to marry some fire nation girl. I want you to be with <em>me!\u201d </em></p>\n<p>All the arguments Zuko had on his tongue are now gone. It\u2019s as if he\u2019s been knocked upside the head. Zuko blinks quickly, and asks in a whisper,</p>\n<p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI-It\u2019s bullshit! You shouldn\u2019t be forced to be with someone just to \u2013 \u201d</p>\n<p>Zuko\u2019s brain pieces it all together at once. He catches Sokka\u2019s hand and pulls it out of his robes.</p>\n<p>\u201cI understand your concern,\u201d Zuko says, forcefully calm. \u201cBut even if I was to marry a woman, I would choose not to have my own children anyways. The throne being passed by blood is what put us in this situation to begin with.\u201d Sokka\u2019s eyes widen, and Zuko lets go of his wrist. \u201cIf that\u2019s the reason for your confession, then I don\u2019t want it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sokka scowls.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou idiot. That\u2019s not just \u2013 <em>ugh! </em>You don\u2019t get it!\u201d</p>\n<p><em>Sokka smells like jasmine tea, </em>is the last coherent thought Zuko has.</p>\n<p>Sokka\u2019s hands clap at his cheeks, and Zuko is dragged into a hot, smothering kiss. He jerks away at first, but Sokka is insistent, his lips moving like he\u2019s trying to tell him something, and Zuko gets caught in it by nature. His stubble is rough but his lips <em>are </em>soft, and it\u2019s the most overwhelming kiss Zuko has ever had. Just as Zuko\u2019s eyes slide shut, they slam back open with some common sense. He pulls away as far as the tree will allow him, and he grabs Sokka by the neck.</p>\n<p>\u201cSokka wait,\u201d Zuko pants. \u201cYou don\u2019t want this.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShit,\u201d Sokka curses, wiping his mouth. \u201cDon\u2019t you see it? We\u2019re better <em>together. </em>I\u2019m better! It\u2019s all \u2013 a fuckin\u2019 <em>crapshoot </em>but \u2013 don\u2019t you think we could be more?\u201d</p>\n<p>Zuko\u2019s heart squeezes painfully. Sokka is in his lap, and his expression is vulnerable and hard to look at. Zuko chooses his words carefully, and delivers them with intent.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. But I\u2019m not going to be your experiment.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sokka looks hurt; then, the anger follows. Fingers squeeze his arms again and Zuko stiffens, ready for a fight, but Sokka conks their foreheads hard enough to sting, and it stuns him momentarily.</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t ever,\u201d Sokka growls, \u201c<em>Ever. </em>Accuse that of me again.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell what am I to think?\u201d Zuko winces, as Sokka presses harder against his new bruise. \u201cThat you <em>like me?\u201d </em></p>\n<p>\u201cYES! You stupid firecracker!\u201d</p>\n<p>Sokka\u2019s eyes are watery, and all the air sucks out of Zuko\u2019s lungs, like Aang is bending it himself.</p>\n<p>And like the snap of a twig; like a single, loud <em>crack \u2013 </em>Zuko\u2019s resolve breaks down the middle. He flips Sokka onto his back, pins him down and presses an arm across his chest to keep him still. Sokka twists and fights instinctually, and Zuko lowers himself into his personal space.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe. Can\u2019t. Do. This.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d Sokka squirms, determined as ever. \u201cYou a coward?\u201d</p>\n<p>Sokka\u2019s hair has slipped out of his wolf tail and is a tangled mess in the grass. His cheeks are red, his neck is sweaty, and worst of all, his eyes are that wild and furious sea storm.</p>\n<p>Zuko speaks so close, they share the same air. His tone is rough and deliberate.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t like you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThen why are you always looking at me?\u201d</p>\n<p>Zuko crushes their mouths together to shut him up. Sokka is able wiggle an arm around and pull him closer, and Zuko curls a hand in the grass to steady himself. Sokka has a wicked tongue, a wicked mouth \u2013 he\u2019s just a sin Zuko shouldn\u2019t have, and he tastes better for it. Their kisses are wet and messy because they\u2019re not aiming for charm, just senseless, needy decadence. They move together like they know exactly where the other will be (and Zuko can feel exactly where he bites his lip, exactly how sharp his teeth are--). And then the kiss parts mutually. \u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cBad liar,\u201d Sokka tells him.</p>\n<p>\u201cI know,\u201d Zuko says.</p>\n<p>Sokka curls a hand up in his long hair and Zuko lays over his top half, squirms an arm between Sokka and the grass just to pull his waist closer to him, and Sokka arches up like molten clay. They align perfectly; muscle on muscle, Zuko\u2019s long hair indistinguishable from Sokka\u2019s spilled on the ground. Kissing Sokka isn\u2019t like a girl. He\u2019s not shy, he\u2019s not placid, and Zuko has to throw his weight into it just to keep Sokka from taking complete control.</p>\n<p>Zuko pulls back to stare at him, and Sokka\u2019s hand is heavy on the back of his head. His breathing is labored, and he stares right back.</p>\n<p>\u201cI love when you look at me,\u201d Sokka says outright. Zuko\u2019s stomach does a flip, but Sokka keeps talking. \u201cYou\u2019re always \u2013 always just working so hard, staring at your books so intensely. I feel like I have to work just as hard to get you to see me that way.\u201d</p>\n<p>Zuko wets his lips. \u201cWhat way?\u201d</p>\n<p><em>\u201cAny.</em>\u201d Sokka feels up his bare cheek. \u201cI\u2019m going to say something gay as shit. Your eyes are fucking beautiful.\u201d</p>\n<p>Zuko groans and presses his forehead into Sokka\u2019s chest.</p>\n<p>\u201cDammit. Listen to me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHm?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m going to invite you back to my room, and you\u2019re going to be the better person and say no.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019m not going to do that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Zuko just can\u2019t stop kissing him. Once they get started they just can\u2019t stop, and Zuko doesn\u2019t care how many clothes there are, what position they\u2019re in or what Sokka is doing with his hands \u2013 he just needs that stupid mouth.</p>\n<p>\u201cFuck that feels weird,\u201d Sokka gasps.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019ve never done this to yourself?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course not! What would my dad think if he walked in on me with three fingers up my aaaahhh\u2014\u201d Sokka whines and rolls his head back into the pillows.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019m going to ask you to put a pin in that,\u201d Zuko says.</p>\n<p>Sokka is a vice around his fingers, tight and hot but giving way with time, and Zuko finds his mouth again and kisses until his tongue hurts. Sokka groans when he presses deep up his ass, and thick fingers grab at Zuko\u2019s hair.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Ohh </em>fuck. Okay, yeah, I\u2019m riding the shit out of you. Take your robe off.\u201d</p>\n<p>Zuko pulls away long enough to yank his arms out of the sleeves and toss the sash somewhere. Sokka is butt naked on his sheets, and Zuko can\u2019t stop looking at him; little pink scars are pricked here and there, strong abdominals, and his hips are defined and his cock is thick and flushed and he looks like a painting to be hung up somewhere. Also, great ass.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Zuko startles when Sokka presses a hand flat to the scar on his chest.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt looks so different,\u201d Sokka mumbles. His eyelashes are long. Zuko wants to suck his cock so goddamn bad. He forces himself to focus, and lets Sokka do as he pleases.</p>\n<p>\u201cLightning,\u201d Zuko explains.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe scarring is lighter.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s because Katara healed it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sokka hums thoughtfully, and then makes a face.</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay, let\u2019s not talk about my sister while we\u2019re doing this. Roll over.\u201d</p>\n<p>Zuko does as he says, and holds Sokka by the hips as he settles on top.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou sure? Might hurt.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sokka gives him a look.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat, like you know?\u201d</p>\n<p>Zuko coughs, \u201cUh. Maybe.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sokka stares intently as he yanks Zuko\u2019s pants down. He doesn\u2019t hesitate to fondle him, and Zuko inhales sharp and quiet as he squeezes his erection.</p>\n<p>\u201cHuh,\u201d Sokka mumbles. \u201cI guess not so different.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSame shit you\u2019ve got.\u201d Zuko feels over Sokka\u2019s veiny hipbones and the V between his legs. \u201cFreaking out yet?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh please, that is so like, <em>two </em>months ago when I jacked off furiously into your bathtub,\u201d Sokka says quickly, squeezing his balls. \u201cUhh, sorry about that by the way.\u201d</p>\n<p>Zuko snickers, and bats Sokka\u2019s hand away to find lube and line himself up.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou should be apologizing to the maids.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHmm, maybe I\u2019ll just die instead.\u201d</p>\n<p>Zuko catches him by the jaw and pulls his face close enough to kiss. Sokka hums happily, and Zuko breathes in through his nose before letting it go.</p>\n<p>\u201cDid you think about this?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve thought about a lot of things,\u201d Sokka says. \u201cMany, many positions with your long ass legs. <em>Fuck </em>you are thick, what the hell dude.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSlow,\u201d Zuko warns.</p>\n<p>Sokka is only able to bounce a couple times before he\u2019s too overwhelmed by the stretch \u2013 but that alone was worth it\u2019s own weight in gold, so Zuko doesn\u2019t mind rolling him over and folding their hands together in the sheets. It gets easier with more oil, and Sokka goes from tight, restrained grunts to opened mouthed moaning and insistent squirming.</p>\n<p>Zuko smacks his ass and forces him face down in the pillows, \u201cStop that, I keep slipping out.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFeels so good,\u201d Sokka muffles into the pillow. \u201cYou\u2019re so, ngh, hot. And your mouth tastes like ash but it\u2019s like, really sexy. Just the sound of your breathing turns me on \u2014 I didn\u2019t think it was <em>unnh </em>possible.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd you are <em>loud,</em>\u201d Zuko grunts against his ear, and has to squeeze his eyes shut and concentrate when Sokka\u2019s ass clamps down around him. \u201cFuck, Sokka. Stop that.\u201d \u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOohh so that\u2019s it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Zuko screws him harder, and he has to flick his sweaty bangs out of his eyes, and everything is excruciatingly hot (sex in summer, sex in summer), but every sound Sokka makes just drives Zuko to thrust <em>harder, </em>makes him want to be better \u2013 yes, so very selfish \u2013 but his common sense is gone, and Sokka\u2019s body is dangerously addictive.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s no doubt about it, they are both men. Fuzzy legs, scratchy late-night shadow \u2013 Zuko rocks Sokka into the sheets so his cock will rub against the pillows, and Sokka comes so loud he screams, and there\u2019s no way the front guards didn\u2019t hear it. Ah well.</p>\n<p>\u201cFuck me, fuck me,\u201d Sokka curses, trembling. Zuko flips him over and Sokka shifts his hips and kisses into his mouth and Zuko has to plant his hands in the sheets so he won\u2019t burn him by accident. The tightness in his stomach is a dead giveaway, and Zuko pulls out and silently finishes along the sweaty, slippery muscle of Sokka\u2019s hip-flexor.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThat is <em>easily </em>the hottest thing I\u2019ve ever seen,\u201d Sokka replies. Zuko grinds into him for the aftershocks and groans through his teeth.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re still hard?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBest stamina in the south,\u201d Sokka teases, and then reaches down to stroke Zuko further. He\u2019s way too sensitive, and Zuko trembles heavy. \u201cAlso uh yeah. Gay sex? Pretty awesome. Nobody told me that, should\u2019ve come with a warning.\u201d</p>\n<p>Zuko pats his hand away and crawls up to take his mouth. Sokka moans more pretty noises, and like all his precious things, Zuko takes good care of him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re not as hot as I thought you\u2019d be,\u201d Sokka says in afterthought.</p>\n<p>\u201cGee, thanks,\u201d Zuko mumbles. \u201cGo to sleep.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s not what I meant, weirdo! I just mean\u2026\u201d A hand drags up his back, and Zuko all but melts. \u201cYou\u2019re like. Normal.\u201d</p>\n<p>Zuko snorts.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat. You thought I kept fire in my <em>skin?\u201d </em></p>\n<p>\u201cWell \u2013 you breathe it out sometimes!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBecause firebending is in the <em>breath,</em>\u201d Zuko enunciates, and turns his head to exhale steam and blow it over at Sokka. He makes a disgusted face, and then a thoughtful one.</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever seen another firebender do that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMy uncle,\u201d Zuko explains sleepily. \u201cAnd the dragons. S\u2019 where I learned it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Damn Sokka\u2019s hands. Fingers knead into his back, and Zuko drifts in and out as Sokka talks.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s crazy, you deserve to be a teacher. You were kinda\u2019 a dick to Aang but like, a good dick. Hm\u2026good dick\u2026hey, you still up?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHate you,\u201d Zuko mumbles. He clasps the back of Sokka\u2019s head and forces him into the pillows. <em>\u201cSleep.\u201d </em></p>\n<p>Sokka snickers, and shifts onto his side. He\u2019s finally gone quiet, but his hand hasn\u2019t stopped its circles at his spine.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey Zuko?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHm.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sokka hesitates, and then says. \u201cYou know what, nevermind. We\u2019ll talk tomorrow.\u201d</p>\n<p>Fingers trace the nape of his neck, and Zuko falls asleep with another warm body, and he can\u2019t remember why this was a bad idea.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Oh hey. Zuko remembers why this was a bad idea.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He wakes up into the biggest crisis of his life. The sun has warmed the windows and the sheets are twisted at the end of the bed, and Sokka is sprawled out naked and dead to the world, thighs spread, head tucked in his arms, hair pooled down his back, and Zuko\u2019s heart jumps out of his freaking chest.</p>\n<p>He flies out of the bed, hovers by the end and slaps a hand over his mouth.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em>Shit. Shit shit shit. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u00a0</em>\n</p>\n<p>There are no doubts. Zuko was stone cold sober, and he slept with the next to be chief of the southern Water Tribe; his best friend, his <em>very male, very good best friend. </em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em>Agni forgive me. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cGood morning buttercups,\u201d Sokka greets the study guards. \u201cHope the rain hasn\u2019t been too rough on your delicate baby skin.\u201d</p>\n<p>The guards tense, but can\u2019t rebuttal with the Fire Lord so close. Sokka waves, and Zuko doesn\u2019t turn around as he slams the door behind him.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve got Lien\u2019s notes from the trade meeting,\u201d Sokka shows off a scroll. \u201cThey\u2019re trying to hackle down tariffs which I know you\u2019re pretty lenient about but if you give \u2018em an inch you give \u2018em a mile, you know?\u201d Zuko tenses as Sokka sits at the corner of his desk. \u201cAlso, thanks for making me do the walk of shame today. Real classy of you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Zuko rises; he wordlessly hands Sokka a scroll and crosses towards the library wall.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d Sokka asks.</p>\n<p>\u201cYour contract,\u201d Zuko answers. \u201cI\u2019m requesting a new ambassador.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sokka goes very, very still. His hands tighten on the scroll.</p>\n<p>\u201cUh. Sorry. What was that?\u201d</p>\n<p>Zuko looks him in the eye, and pulls out a law book.</p>\n<p>\u201cSokka, you need to go home.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sokka tosses the scroll off the desk.</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you being fucking serious right now?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDo I sound like I\u2019m joking?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut last night we were \u2013 I thought \u2013 \u201d Sokka\u2019s heart breaks, all over his face. \u201cWhat did I do wrong?\u201d</p>\n<p>Zuko\u2019s soul hurts so bad, he could throw up.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t do anything. I just\u2026made a bad call.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cA bad call,\u201d Sokka echoes.</p>\n<p>Zuko sighs, rubbing a hand over his eyes.</p>\n<p>\u201cSokka, what did you think was going to happen? That we\u2019d hook up and hold hands and sprint into the sunset?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI mean, it sounds stupid when you put it that way!\u201d Sokka exasperates. \u201cBut yeah! Fucking maybe!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m saying this because you\u2019re one of my closest friends, and I care about you,\u201d Zuko says. \u201cGo home and take care of your own people.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBecause you care\u2026\u201d Sokka laughs dryly. \u201cReal funny way of showing it. Why are you running away from this?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not running away!\u201d Zuko argues. \u201cI\u2019m trying to prevent a coup! If we walked out on that street right now, both our nations would lose their collective minds.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cZuko you are such a thick pain in the ass, but I <em>adore </em>you,\u201d Sokka hisses, walking closer, and he\u2019s puffed up to his full stature, and Zuko\u2019s heart races like he\u2019s about to go to war. \u201cI thought we really connected. Why are you so afraid to take what you want?!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI never said I wanted you,\u201d Zuko replies cruelly. Sokka opens his mouth to argue, but pauses on an exhale. Zuko can almost see the memory flicker through his eyes, before he coils back into himself.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re the worst,\u201d Sokka mutters, cold and hurt.</p>\n<p>Zuko has to actively work to keep his voice from cracking. \u201cYou\u2019re blinded by your feelings.\u00a0<em>I </em>of all people should know. Come back to me in a couple weeks, and we\u2019ll talk.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sokka\u2019s expression is walled and detached as he squats down to pick up the scroll.</p>\n<p>\u201cTch, asshole. Making all the decisions without giving a damn to anyone\u2019s feelings.\u201d Sokka rises slowly and turn his back. \u201cYou\u2019re just like your dad.\u201d Sokka slams the door after him, and Zuko slides to the floor.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He stares at the wall; stares and stares until it burns.</p>\n<p>Zuko flips to his back, looks to the ceiling, but doesn\u2019t receive an answer there either. His heart still feels like it\u2019s coiled and shrunken and buried in the pit of his stomach, and every time he swallows he almost wants to cry. Zuko can remember the exact moment he last cried, and let\u2019s just say it was a long, long time ago.</p>\n<p>The palace is eerie and quiet at night. Zuko crawls out of bed and traverses the halls, hopeful that a walk will tire out his brain.</p>\n<p><em>Sokka is leaving tomorrow, </em>his mind repeats. <em>Sokka is leaving tomorrow. </em></p>\n<p>Zuko walks past his old childhood bedroom. The original fire lord\u2019s quarters have long been boarded up, because Zuko can\u2019t stand to step a foot in there. Azula\u2019s room is untouched. Zuko has no desire to go in there, either.</p>\n<p>One of the candles flicker. Zuko continues down the hall, but his eye snaps to a shadow behind the pillar. Then, Zuko is hauling an arm over his back, slamming a masked body to the ground and firebending towards the second shadow.</p>\n<p>His attack is nulled, and Zuko\u2019s brain works through the combat on instinct.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em>Firebender. </em>\n</p>\n<p>Zuko cuts through a fireball, dodges a second and leg sweeps the attacker. He can hear more footsteps, and Zuko shouts, \u201c<em>Hey!\u201d </em>But a third attacker is knocked out by a boomerang.</p>\n<p>Zuko whips around. Sokka grabs a third intruder by the throat and hauls them up the wall one handed; boomerang comes back, and Sokka grabs it with his left.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou brought that here?\u201d Zuko sighs.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s a superior weapon,\u201d Sokka argues. The masked figure struggles and chokes in his grip, and Sokka squeezes tighter.\u00a0 Zuko uses the opportunity to disarm the last person dressed in black; he twists their arm behind their back.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou,\u201d Zuko growls. \u201cWho sent you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFuck off.\u201d</p>\n<p>A squeak echoes in the hall, and Zuko turns to see Lien with a candle.</p>\n<p>\u201cLien, go get the guards!\u201d Sokka calls. Lien looks at the people on the floor, and nods shakily.</p>\n<p>\u201cY-yes! Guards! <em>Guards! </em>We have intruders!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOne more time,\u201d Zuko repeats. \u201cWho sent you?\u201d</p>\n<p>Nothing.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Sokka lets go of the man\u2019s throat in favor of throwing him up against the wall by his skull.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo answer? Alright, you\u2019re coming with us, buddy.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>With six masks removed and their wrists in chains, Zuko doesn\u2019t recognize a single one of them.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Sokka is obviously still pissed at him, but it\u2019s clear that a more important situation has arose. His shoulders are tense, and he won\u2019t look in Zuko\u2019s direction longer than he has to, but he\u2019s still here.</p>\n<p>\u201cAlright, we\u2019re going to play good cop bad cop,\u201d Sokka says. \u201cI\u2019m the good cop. Which means, if you lie to me, I\u2019m only going to crush <em>one </em>of your nuts. While this guy?\u201d Sokka points. \u201cHe\u2019s the Fire Lord. So if you lie to <em>him, </em>you\u2019re going to wish you and I had come to terms.\u201d</p>\n<p>The intruders look uneasy. A stubborn one on the end refuses to cooperate, but the others might talk.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis is the last time I\u2019ll ask,\u201d Zuko warns. \u201cWho are you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLook, we\u2019re just assassins for hire,\u201d a man says quickly. The stubborn one begins to shout, but Zuko waves to the guards, and they gag him.</p>\n<p>\u201cWho hired you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cMmh! Mmnh!\u201d </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u201cLoyalists up north,\u201d another grumbles. \u201cLook, I got no problem wit\u2019 politics, but these guys \u2013 they like your father a helluva\u2019 lot more than they like yous, kid.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sokka eyes him over the accent, and Zuko nods.</p>\n<p>\u201cEarth kingdom.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDamn, if you\u2019re assassins, then you\u2019re pretty shit at your job,\u201d Sokka says.</p>\n<p>The ninjas\u2019 eyes widen in surprise, but Zuko continues.</p>\n<p>\u201cThese loyalists. What is their goal?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ve told you enough.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHave you ever heard of a nutcracker?\u201d Sokka asks lightly. \u201cIf you\u2019re real good, you can use the end of a sword instead.\u201d \u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cTh-they want to destroy you and return your father to the throne!\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cFuck,\u201d Zuko irritably sighs. \u201cI knew they were out there, but to think they\u2019d go so far.\u201d</p>\n<p>The talkative one grins. He seems like the type of madman that wants to watch the world burn. Zuko\u2019s seen enough of them.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, this is only the beginning. That little decree you made about the homos last month <em>reeeally </em>pushed \u2018em over the edge. They\u2019re just rarin\u2019 to have your neck.\u201d</p>\n<p>Zuko doesn\u2019t allow any emotion to cross his face. Sokka keeps a cool lid, but his hands tighten so hard his knuckles pop.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell that\u2019s nice,\u201d Zuko answers. He waves towards the guards. \u201cThrow them in jail.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHey!! We told you everything we know!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDude, you tried to kill the <em>Fire Lord</em><em>,</em>\u201d Sokka snorts. \u201cYou should count yourselves lucky that you\u2019re not eating lava soup at the bottom of a volcano.\u201d</p>\n<p>The intruders shout and struggle as the guards haul them off. Zuko crosses his arms, and stares at the wall in frustration.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis is fucking crazy,\u201d Sokka shakes his head.</p>\n<p>\u201cI know.\u201d Zuko eyes him. \u201cNow do you understand why you need to leave?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThis is exactly why I\u2019m going to <em>stay!</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSokka \u2013 \u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAt least until the end of the week,\u201d Sokka argues. The fight in his eyes deflates a little. \u201cLook. I won\u2019t \u2013 I won\u2019t come near you, or anything. I just\u2026I\u2019m not going until I know you\u2019re okay.\u201d</p>\n<p><em>I want you near me, </em>Zuko thinks. <em>I want to kiss you until my mouth goes numb. </em></p>\n<p>\u201cI can take care of myself.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThen please tolerate it for me,\u201d Sokka begs, and Zuko feels like he\u2019s going to die.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhatever,\u201d Zuko snaps, and returns to an empty bed, officially doomed to restless night.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em>You\u2019re just like your dad. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u00a0</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u00a0</em>\n</p>\n<p>Zuko shoots upwards at the throne.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He didn\u2019t realize that he had dozed off. Really, this is a meeting that Zuko should be paying attention to, especially because it concerns the newly formed United Republic of Nations, but Zuko just can\u2019t keep his head in it today.</p>\n<p>He knows Sokka saw, because he\u2019s staring right at him. Zuko stares back at the map center on the table, and an officiant clears her throat.</p>\n<p>\u201cUm, Fire Lord Zuko. Would you prefer if we reconvened at a future time?\u201d</p>\n<p>Zuko rubs his eyes and sighs, \u201cActually, yes. If Aang is visiting for the festival, then it might be best to wait for his opinion.\u201d</p>\n<p>Mumbling in the room confirms the end of their meeting, and Sokka avoids Zuko\u2019s gaze as he rises from the table, shakes hands and leaves without a further word. No hugs, no laughing down the hall, no lunch afterwards.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>There are no more assassination attempts for the rest of the week. That, at least, is a small mercy. It doesn\u2019t make Zuko feel any better. Doesn\u2019t stop him from running his hand over the far side of his bed, as if the cool cotton will give him all his answers.</p>\n<p>Zuko hates this; hates that he has created this terrible awkwardness between he and Sokka. It\u2019s miserable to be in the study alone. It\u2019s like he can\u2019t think straight, like a fog has fallen over his mind.</p>\n<p>He can\u2019t bear to see Sokka off. It\u2019s unprofessional, he\u2019s a terrible friend, but Zuko thinks \u2013 he won\u2019t be able to do it a second time. If Sokka looked at him all <em>broken </em>like that again, Zuko would fall to his knees like a child.</p>\n<p>A knock raps at his door. It is gentle.</p>\n<p>\u201cLien,\u201d Zuko greets.</p>\n<p>Lien peeks in the door and clears her throat.</p>\n<p>\u201cLord Zuko. I am alerting you that Ambassador Sokka is departing by balloon.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThank you. Dismissed.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lien looks at him strangely, but she is quick to bow and duck out the door. Zuko rubs his eyes and forces away his feelings.</p>\n<p>A tap on his window nearly scares him out of his skin. Zuko extinguishes his lit fire dagger, and sighs as a messenger hawk taps once more.</p>\n<p>The hawk is grey and white, and Zuko immediately recognizes it as uncle\u2019s. He quickly unhitches the latch and takes the small scroll from the hawk\u2019s pouch.</p>\n<p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Zuko mumbles. The hawk flies off, and Zuko closes the window and unrolls the letter, his hands not as steady as he would prefer them to be.</p>\n<p>The letter is written in his uncle\u2019s crappy handwriting. Zuko hesitates when he remembers the last letter he sent. So many weeks have passed \u2013 he almost feels like whatever advice his uncle is about to give, it\u2019s long outdated. Zuko steadies himself and reads it anyways.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em>Dear Nephew. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em>The Jasmine Dragon is prospering, thank you for asking! I have made good friends with the sencha traders from the west, and now I am given first pick of their produce! My tea has never tasted better, you must try it on your next visit. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>I am also pleased to hear about the various improvements within the palace. Change will not come unless you incite it first. My dear Zuko, I must confess something to you these many months later. There was no coincidence that your friend has come to you; it was I that reached out to your old teammates in the Water Tribe, and asked them to assist you.\u00a0 </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>I know you might see it as betrayal. But nephew, I could no longer stand to see you return so broken to me each year. As much as I would love to attribute to your rule over the Fire Nation, I know this is something your generation must overcome if peace is to truly succeed. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>I did not foresee your feelings for your close friend, but I must say the news makes me very happy! Zuko, your decisions are your own, but you know I will give my own words of wisdom anyways; </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Your ancestors began \u2018traditions\u2019 to take power and invoke fear. So then, what will the nation think, if their fire lord <u>breaks</u> tradition for true love? I think the power that holds is immeasurable. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>In regards to your question; I will not give you the answer myself. But your heart will know, I\u2019m sure of it. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>All my love, </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Uncle Iroh. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u00a0</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Zuko stares at the parchment longer than he should. The tip of the letter is stained with tea, and the bottom is chewed from the hawk, and Zuko hugs it to his chest like his uncle is here in the flesh.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><em>Sokka, </em>Zuko thinks, with butterflies in his stomach. Then, panic runs down his back. <em>Shit, Sokka! </em></p>\n<p>\n<em>\u00a0</em>\n</p>\n<p>He bolts out of the study. The guards startle as he throws open the doors, sprinting through the hall and out towards the balloon docks.</p>\n<p>\u201cLord Zuko!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAt ease!\u201d He calls back, and surfs down the railing stairs. The guards share baffled looks, but Zuko is too busy huffing it across the courtyard. These stupid formal slippers are slowing him down, so he kicks them off and runs barefoot.</p>\n<p>Zuko spots the balloon at near take off.</p>\n<p><em>\u201cStop!!!!\u201d </em>He shouts.</p>\n<p>Sokka whips his head around in the basket, and his escort pauses mid-firebend.</p>\n<p>\u201cZuko?!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t go!\u201d Zuko shouts, skidding along the deck. The balloon is a good fifteen feet in the air, but Sokka easily hops the basket and lands with a heavy thud. Sokka races towards him, face lit with panic.</p>\n<p>\u201cZuko? What happened? Are you okay?!\u201d</p>\n<p>Sokka grabs his shoulders and Zuko clasps him back, his breath racing as fast as his heart.</p>\n<p>\u201cStay,\u201d Zuko demands, taking in shaky inhales to catch his breath. \u201cSokka I\u2019m sorry \u2013 just \u2013 <em>stay. </em>Please.\u201d</p>\n<p>Multiple emotions cross Sokka\u2019s face; concern, confusion, anger.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re the one that kicked my ass out the door. Now you <em>don\u2019t </em>want me to leave? What the hell is wrong with you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t care if everyone hates me,\u201d Zuko explains. \u201cI don\u2019t care if they try to kill me. I just \u2013 I just wanted to keep you out of it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sokka frowns, but listens.</p>\n<p>\u201cZuko, people have tried to kill me all my life.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI know,\u201d Zuko says. \u201cStay, please.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sokka sighs, and holds Zuko tighter by the arms.</p>\n<p>\u201cI need to know what you want from me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Zuko takes one of Sokka\u2019s hands and places it over his heart. Sokka startles at first, and then his eyes go wide when he feels how quickly Zuko\u2019s heart is beating.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m falling in love with you,\u201d Zuko explains.</p>\n<p>Sokka\u2019s breath catches. The nearby guards pointedly turn away, but Zuko doesn\u2019t bother to care. He\u2019s already made up his mind.</p>\n<p>Sokka swallows, and then leads him by the arm. \u201cCome on. Let\u2019s talk about this somewhere else.\u201d He waves to the balloon saying, \u201cUh, sorry Xao! Ride cancelled! Thanks for uh \u2013 anyway, bye!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Sokka kisses him deeply as soon as the door shuts. Zuko\u2019s back hits the wood, and he cradles Sokka\u2019s face as he returns the kiss feverishly. Sokka pulls them apart. \u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDammit,\u201d Sokka curses. \u201cWhy do you keep breaking my heart?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve given up a lot of things for the throne,\u201d Zuko says. \u201cBut I don\u2019t want to give up you. I couldn\u2019t do it, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sokka\u2019s face crumples, and he presses his forehead into Zuko\u2019s shoulder.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis is all new for me too, okay?! I\u2026for so long I wasn\u2019t sure if you even <em>tolerated </em>me. And then \u2013 you kissed me back and, and I thought\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>Zuko prods him upright so he can sweep Sokka\u2019s bangs out of his face. His ponytail is loose, so Zuko just pulls it out entirely.</p>\n<p>\u201cDuty and heart have always been a mess for me,\u201d Zuko explains. \u201cI\u2019ve always looked at you this way. These months with you here...\u201d He pets Sokka\u2019s stubbly jaw the way he\u2019s wanted to. \u201cYou amaze me with how sharp your mind is, and how unbelievably stupid you can be.\u201d Sokka opens his mouth to argue, but Zuko continues, \u201cYou\u2019re beautiful. I\u2019m sorry I never told you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sokka looks like he wants to say lot of things, but he settles on an amazed, \u201cR\u2026Really?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes.\u201d Zuko sighs. \u201cThere are repercussions to us being together. You\u2019re aware of that, right?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah. I don\u2019t know what\u2019ll happen to my chief nomination.\u201d</p>\n<p>Zuko swallows, heart racing. \u201cYou knew, and you still\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe world is changing, Zuko,\u201d Sokka stares into him, sharp sharp blue. \u201cThe colonies are uniting. Soon we\u2019re going to have <em>more </em>than just four nations. I don\u2019t know where my place in the world is yet, but I know I\u2019m going to find it with you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0Zuko slips his hand to the back of his neck, and tips his head so he can kiss him. It\u2019s easy being the same height, and Sokka\u2019s hands grab him by the middle to haul him closer. They fit good together, all their sharp edges. \u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u201cReally though,\u201d Zuko interrupts. \u201cYou can\u2019t be my ambassador if we get involved.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u201cI know,\u201d Sokka says. \u201cNuvua was never pregnant.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2026Are you fucking s\u2013 <em>hey! </em>Put me down!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>This time is different. Zuko leads Sokka\u2019s hand between his legs and shows him what to do, and then Sokka sits up against the headboard and lets him ride.</p>\n<p>Zuko presses their hands together as he grinds back and forth \u2013 and all their callouses align perfectly. Right at the tops of their palms, over their thumbs and beneath the second knuckle. Sokka\u2019s fingers are thicker, but Zuko\u2019s are longer, and Zuko lays them flat just to measure.</p>\n<p>Sokka licks hotly into the side of his neck, and Zuko curls with it, biting down silently.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re getting distracted.\u201d</p>\n<p>Zuko sits up and slides back down slowly, Sokka\u2019s length rutting into him until their thighs touch.</p>\n<p>\u201cSorry.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDoes it hurt?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo.\u201d Zuko sighs contently when Sokka wraps a hand around his cock. \u201cYou feel good.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sokka groans from the throat, and his hands slip up his outer thighs and around to his ass. Zuko\u2019s stomach clenches when Sokka squeezes, and he rocks up and forward to chase the feeling. Their breathing sounds lewd; the lanterns in the room are flickering to Zuko\u2019s heartbeat, but Sokka doesn\u2019t know that yet.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re so quiet,\u201d Sokka mumbles. Zuko is actually so hard his balls hurt, but he doesn\u2019t say that.</p>\n<p>\u201cSorry.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sokka sits back to look him over \u2013 zig sag lightning scars, sweat sticking his hair to his neck; Sokka tips his head back and mouths across the lump in his throat.</p>\n<p>\u201cStill really fucking hot. Can I roll you over?\u201d</p>\n<p>Zuko thinks about it. His thighs are starting to burn, not that he\u2019ll ever admit it. \u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sokka pulls out and Zuko slides to his back, and he white-knuckles the sheets when Sokka spreads his thighs and slips back in him. The room smells like sex and oil, and Zuko claws at Sokka\u2019s wide back to get him closer.</p>\n<p>\u201cGah, <em>fuck,</em>\u201d Sokka winces, taking a moment to get that slow rhythm back. \u201cYou\u2019re tighter than a girl.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo shit,\u201d Zuko mumbles. Sokka grinds real, <em>real </em>slow, full of slippery heat and power, and Zuko doesn\u2019t realize he\u2019s made a sound until Sokka is sitting up on his elbows to stare down at him.</p>\n<p>\u201cWow,\u201d Sokka exhales, with sparkles in his eyes. Zuko bats his face away.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re so annoying.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPlease moan again.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo\u2014<em>ghh!</em>\u201d Zuko bites, and knees into Sokka\u2019s hip to keep rolling with the pace he\u2019s set.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s it, wow,\u201d Sokka rambles, hair dripping between them. \u201cYou\u2019re so pretty, like, mmm, one of those glass dolls.\u201d Sokka tests a harder thrust and Zuko doesn\u2019t budge, and Sokka laughs a little, and it\u2019s really sexy. \u201cBut you\u2019re crazy strong, damn. I don\u2019t even know what my type is anymore.\u201d</p>\n<p>Zuko feels into the shaved undercut of Sokka\u2019s hair, and tastes his lips for a moment, before replying.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve seen your girlfriends. I don\u2019t think your type has changed.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sokka laughs steamy against his cheek, \u201cYou know. You\u2019re not wrong.\u201d</p>\n<p>No matter how he sees it, Zuko has formed a very unfortunate attachment to this man. Top, bottom, upside down and sideways, Zuko wishes he could stich them together thread by thread. He may not ever admit it out loud, but he sure does think it.</p>\n<p>Sokka licks wetly into his mouth, and Zuko\u2019s face heats when he makes another sound, but Sokka just echoes it back even louder, so his embarrassment is forgotten.</p>\n<p>Sokka doesn\u2019t give up on fucking him slowly into the downy pillows, and Zuko stops breathing when his stomach begins to twist and coil, and he chokes and shivers and squeezes at Sokka\u2019s shoulder to say <em>don\u2019t stop, don\u2019t \u2013 </em>and Sokka figures out that he likes to have his neck played with, and it\u2019s over as soon as he bites down and sucks. It\u2019s like redirecting lightning, like an uncontrollable force passing through his entire body.</p>\n<p>\u201cAh shit, ah shit that\u2019s hot,\u201d Sokka rambles, and he pulls out quick so Zuko can sloppily finish him off into his hand. The muscles in Sokka\u2019s stomach twitch as he dips chin and moans, and Zuko throbs in sympathy.</p>\n<p>\u201cSorry,\u201d Zuko pants, his head falling back onto the pillows. \u201cI can\u2019t, <em>ngh.</em>\u201d Sokka licks one final line from his sternum to the base of his neck, and Zuko bats him off. <em>\u201cSokka.\u201d </em></p>\n<p>Sokka\u2019s hair is sticky and sweaty just like Zuko\u2019s, but it looks lewd rather than gross. Well, maybe it\u2019s a little gross. Zuko finds it attractive anyways. Sokka fingers through the mess on Zuko\u2019s stomach and mumbles, \u201cSheesh, you look obscene. Really wish I was a water bender right now.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cEeww you\u2019re disgusting.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sokka sticks his fingers in his mouth, and Zuko\u2019s entire body flushes.</p>\n<p>\u201cHm.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d Zuko croaks, kneeing him away. \u201cDon\u2019t do that if you don\u2019t wanna\u2019 go again.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sokka grins wolfish and climbs up his body to try and kiss him, and Zuko squirms to avoid his mouth, and Sokka laughs as he kisses his chin and his jaw and the corner of his lips, and Zuko groans when Sokka finally lands one on him.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re banished,\u201d Zuko says, wiping his mouth.</p>\n<p>Sokka snickers, and slaps him heavy on the thigh where the muscle is thickest. \u201cYou\u2019re a priss. I kind of dig it.\u201d</p>\n<p>For some reason, Zuko wants to laugh. He\u2019s never felt so light, so tingly all the way to his toes. Zuko just stares him, his eyes going all hazy, and Sokka hovers over him carefully.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey guess what.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m falling in love with you too.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>When Zuko wakes again, it\u2019s to fingers in his hair. It takes embarrassingly long for him to realize that Sokka is giving him water tribe braids.</p>\n<p>Sokka is working at the spot next to his ear, pulling and twisting ever so lightly. Zuko peeps open his good eye, and Sokka pauses.</p>\n<p>\u201cAh. Sorry.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMmm.\u201d Zuko reaches over and pulls Sokka\u2019s thigh over his own. \u201cWhat\u2019s that one mean?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTaken,\u201d Sokka grins. Zuko rolls his eyes, but lets Sokka resume his work. When he reaches the end of the small braid, he pulls out one of his own beads and ties off the end. \u201cThere. Very pretty.\u201d</p>\n<p>Zuko closes his eyes again as Sokka fusses with the braid. His fingers reach up to his ear, and it\u2019s the first time Sokka has ever touched <em>this </em>scar, so Zuko lays very still. Sokka thumbs over the texture beneath his cheek, and when Zuko opens his eyes again, he sees Sokka frowning.</p>\n<p>\u201cToo weird?\u201d Zuko asks. He knows it\u2019s ugly, but at this point, he\u2019s had the scar longer than he hasn\u2019t.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo!\u201d Sokka gasps. \u201cNot at all. I was just thinking, um\u2026I need to apologize.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHuh? What for?\u201d</p>\n<p>Sokka clenches his jaw and turns serious.</p>\n<p>\u201cZuko, you are <em>nothing </em>like your father.\u201d</p>\n<p>Zuko doesn\u2019t know what face he makes. His breath catches somewhere, and everything just goes fuzzy and numb. The natural rasp in his voice nearly doubles.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou \u2013 you don\u2019t have to \u2013 I mean. Look, I know I had it coming\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>Sokka shakes his head. \u201cNo. I never should\u2019ve said that. I didn\u2019t mean it, you hear me? You\u2019re already a thousand times the man he is, so don\u2019t you ever let anyone tell you otherwise.\u201d</p>\n<p>Zuko doesn\u2019t realize he\u2019s crying until water slides sideways down his cheek and across his nose. Sokka jolts, gasping as he grabs Zuko\u2019s face and hauls him to his chest.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo no no-! Don\u2019t cry baby, I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShut up,\u201d Zuko croaks, hugging him back. \u201cJust stop talking.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay. I, um, okay.\u201d Pause. Sniffle. Pause. \u201cYou smell really good.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAgni,\u201d Zuko laughs wetly, and smacks the back of his head. Sokka\u2019s laugh is deep and annoying and cute, so Zuko wipes his nose on the front of his shirt and watches him screech.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He hasn\u2019t felt so at ease with another person in a long time.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The sun festival is here.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lanterns illuminate the streets in gold and red and orange. Dragon-dancers parade in circles, firebenders juggling fireballs on stilts; everything is covered in sun symbols to honor the spirit of Agni, and the capital smells like barbeque and fresh food.</p>\n<p>Both Sokka and Zuko have agreed to wait until the festival passes to seek approval from the avatar before making any public appearances together as a couple. It is what it is. \u00a0</p>\n<p>Reluctant to remove his braid, Zuko hides it behind his ear during the ceremony. He carries the first flame of the festival up the stairs and into the bonfire; thousands are gathered to watch, ready for the festivities to begin.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis week, we honor the life and power Agni has given us,\u201d Zuko says ritually. The bonfire ignites, and Zuko lowers his hands into a resting firebender stance. \u201cMay our new year be sunny and prosperous.\u201d</p>\n<p>Cheering erupts from the crowd, and firebenders begin to dance on the stage. Zuko takes his leave, and Sokka steps out from behind one of the banisters.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo, are you actually going to participate this year?\u201d Sokka winks. Zuko wants to hold his fingers in his own, but keeps his hands carefully to himself.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll think about it. Go get me some peanuts.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNeedy,\u201d Sokka rolls his eyes. \u201cI\u2019ll drag you out sooner or later.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCan\u2019t wait,\u201d Zuko replies flatly, and doesn\u2019t smile until Sokka has descended into the crowd. Musicians beat on hand drums, flute players and singers chanting traditional songs once forgotten.</p>\n<p>\u201cGreat speech, sparky,\u201d a voice says.</p>\n<p>Zuko spins on his heel, and immediately smiles.</p>\n<p>\u201cAang!\u201d Arms wrap around him, and Zuko hugs Aang back. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d Zuko pulls back to see Aang\u2019s smiling face. \u201cI thought you weren\u2019t coming for two more days.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cKatara was antsy,\u201d Aang laughs. \u201cYou look good. I hope everything\u2019s been alright in my absence.\u201d</p>\n<p>Aang is dressed in his air nomad colors, and it looks like he\u2019s grown out the start of a beard.</p>\n<p>\u201cSokka has been a big help,\u201d Zuko admits, trying to keep his tone flat. \u201cWe\u2019ll wait to talk business. Where is Bumi?\u201d</p>\n<p>Aang nods towards the foot of the stairs, where Katara is passing a chubby baby to a very excited uncle Sokka. Zuko physically feels his insides go squishy. Aang tucks his hands behind his back and grins.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo how long have you two been together?\u201d</p>\n<p>Zuko\u2019s eyes nearly pop out of his head. He eloquently flounders,</p>\n<p>\u201cWuh \u2013 what?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, come on,\u201d Aang laughs. \u201cI\u2019m not <em>that </em>big of an airhead.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you using some Avatar trick on me?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cJust my eyeballs,\u201d Aang points, goofy. \u201cI married a water bender. I know what that braid means.\u201d</p>\n<p>Zuko sighs, and resists the urge to unprofessionally rub his face.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2026were going to wait to tell you.\u201d Zuko looks to him \u2013 this tall, bearded man. \u201cYou\u2019re not mad?\u201d</p>\n<p>The drums get louder, and cheering erupts from the crowd. Aang blinks at him owlishly.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou were afraid to tell me?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell\u2026 it\u2019s not like anything good can come from this. And, um.\u201d Zuko rubs his mouth. \u201cWe\u2019re both men.\u201d</p>\n<p>Aang frowns, and for a moment Zuko wonders if he\u2019s about to get lectured \u2013 but Aang\u2019s face softens with understanding.</p>\n<p>\u201cAll love was cherished in the air temples. The way I was raised \u2013 it wasn\u2019t strange or taboo to the monks. Gender and sexuality were a loose concept.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026kind of neat,\u201d Zuko mulls. Aang giggles.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis is going to be a real tornado. But you guys are my friends, so I\u2019ve got your backs.\u201d</p>\n<p>Zuko grabs his shoulder and squeezes his thanks. He turns his head when he hears Katara and Sokka approaching past the guards.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey!\u201d Sokka calls, \u201cI didn\u2019t bring peanuts, but I got something better!\u201d</p>\n<p>Sokka passes him the baby, and Zuko cradles him in his arm.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s big,\u201d Zuko observes, pulling Bumi\u2019s fat fingers out of his mouth.</p>\n<p>\u201cThey grow pretty fast,\u201d Katara smiles. Zuko hugs her with his free arm, and looks back to Bumi, who\u2019s now babbling.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou,\u201d Zuko points, \u201c\u2014are all your mother.\u201d</p>\n<p>Bumi giggles, and Aang pouts.</p>\n<p>\u201cHuh, you think so?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLook at this hair!\u201d Sokka ruffles the mop of hair on Bumi\u2019s head.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not bald! I shave my head! Come on, you guys know this!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe eyes,\u201d Zuko interrupts, and squeezes Bumi\u2019s nose. \u201cAnd this nose. Sorry Aang.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDang,\u201d Aang sighs.</p>\n<p>Sokka is looking at him very intensely. Zuko raises his eyebrow, and Sokka just stares. \u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSorry,\u201d Sokka blurts, and flushes red. \u201cYou\u2019re uh \u2013 nevermind.\u201d</p>\n<p>Aang snorts, and Katara rolls her eyes.</p>\n<p>\u201cThey know,\u201d Zuko explains.</p>\n<p>\u201cKnow what?\u201d Sokka questions. Zuko gestures between them, and Sokka\u2019s eyes bug, \u201cHold on \u2013 seriously?!\u201d</p>\n<p>Bumi begins to fuss, so Katara takes him back into her arms.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah. It\u2019s kind of weird,\u201d Katara admits, \u201cBut cute. You\u2019re like star crossed lovers.\u201d</p>\n<p>Zuko and Sokka both make the exact same <em>ick\u00a0</em>face, and Aang laughs heartily.</p>\n<p>\u201cMaybe I should\u2019ve seen this coming.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThis sucks,\u201d Sokka pouts. \u201cI can\u2019t even surprise my own sister.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWoah woah woah, you two <em>fucked?\u201d </em></p>\n<p>And then there were five.</p>\n<p>\u201cToph!!\u201d Katara gasps.</p>\n<p>\u201cNot you too!\u201d Sokka wails.</p>\n<p>Toph steps up the stairs and plants her fists on her hips. She is wearing her earth kingdom police uniform, and she looks as broad and strong as ever.</p>\n<p>\u201cNow why the hell wasn\u2019t I invited to the party?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou <em>were </em>invited,\u201d Zuko points out.</p>\n<p>\u201cI can\u2019t read, stupid!\u201d</p>\n<p>More hugs go around, and Sokka brushes his fingers against Zuko\u2019s as a sign of affection.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell well, look at this,\u201d Sokka grins. \u201cThe gang\u2019s all here.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMinus Suki,\u201d Katara points. \u201cHow\u2019s she been?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGreat. Having the time of her life with the Kyoshi warriors.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that thing?\u201d Toph points in the general direction of Bumi.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s our son.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWoah. That\u2019s a big baby.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s six month\u2019s old, Toph.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh. What\u2019s he look like?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSquishy?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Adorable,</em>\u201d Aang interjects.</p>\n<p>\u201cSquishy,\u201d Katara confirms.</p>\n<p>\u201cDamn, a lot really has changed around h-\u201d Toph starts, but cuts off quickly. Her bare feet shift on the metal platform, and she whips her head around as if listening for something. Zuko tenses instinctually, right before Toph can shout, <em>\u201cLook out!!\u201d </em></p>\n<p>A rain of fire falls their way. Aang is already bending against it, as Toph peels up the ground to create a shield.</p>\n<p>\u201cKatara!\u201d Aang shouts, but Katara is already sheltering Bumi in her arms, making a mad dash towards Appa.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>The crowd is in chaos. Countless firebenders explode out of the dragon costumes, and people begin to scramble in a panic. Zuko breaks a second fireball, and Aang sends a burst of wind back.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat the heck is going on?!\u201d Aang shouts over the noise. The royal guards begin to create a blockade, running to evacuate civilians and stop the intruders, but a bolt of lightning cuts through their defenses.</p>\n<p>\u201cShit,\u201d Sokka curses, and peeks beyond the barricade. \u201cThe masks. Zuko, it\u2019s more assassins.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMore?!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThere was a failed assassination attempt on my life last week,\u201d Zuko explains quickly. Toph rapid-fires a wave of sharp metal, and Sokka yanks her back before she can get singed.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, they made a serious tactical blunder,\u201d Toph grins. \u201cGood thing we came early.\u201d \u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cFire Lord! You must evacuate!\u201d A guard calls.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo. Protect the civilians,\u201d Zuko commands, ripping off the sleeves of his robe. \u201cWe\u2019ve got it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAlright!\u201d Sokka yanks the sword off a soldier\u2019s hip, \u201cTeam avatar is back in business!\u201d</p>\n<p>A wave of water douses the fire, and the team darts out from behind Toph\u2019s barricade.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s an easy fight. His biggest concern is a lava-bender who rolls out a wall of magma \u2013 which is definitely bad, because it means his father\u2019s loyalists really are enlisting in fire and earth nation ninjas \u2013 but Aang\u2019s eyes glow, and the magma cools into rock, and the threat is contained.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe can\u2019t even enjoy <em>one </em>festival,\u201d Aang sighs, floating back towards the ground. Toph builds an earth prison for each of the traitors, and Zuko shakes the fire off his hands. Guards rush to support and arrest, but it\u2019s already over.</p>\n<p>\u201cSomeone paid you <em>a lot </em>of money for this,\u201d Zuko muses, ripping off a mask. The woman squirms in the rock, turning her head to spit, and Toph cracks her knuckles and builds the prison higher.</p>\n<p>\u201cIs everyone okay?\u201d Katara approaches.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah. Where\u2019s Bumi?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSafe. Did someone really just try to kill the Fire Lord?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYup.\u201d Sokka pokes a man\u2019s forehead with the hilt of his sword. \u201cReal buncha\u2019 geniuses.\u201d</p>\n<p>Aang frowns, and turns to Zuko. \u201cIt looks like we have a lot to talk about.\u201d</p>\n<p>Zuko half smiles in agreement, and Sokka grabs him by the waist and squeezes him snug to his hip.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey, there ain\u2019t nothing team Avatar can\u2019t do!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFire Lord Ozai will rise again,\u201d the traitor hisses. Toph flicks her wrist and wraps a piece of metal around his mouth.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah yeah yeah. Keep crying, little baby.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>All the windows are open, and the festival music is distantly audible from the plaza. After a quick apology and an announcement of the Avatar\u2019s arrival, the Fire Nation civilians slowly resumed their partying.</p>\n<p>\u201cWow, look at us \u2013 one big happy family again,\u201d Aang smiles.</p>\n<p>The palace dining hall is so illuminated, it might as well be day.</p>\n<p>\u201cUgh,\u201d Katara coughs politely into her napkin, and takes a sip of water. \u201cWhy does all Fire Nation food have to be so spicy? I mean \u2013 thank you for the meal, but wow.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou get used to it,\u201d Sokka shrugs.</p>\n<p>\u201cMy asshole won\u2019t,\u201d Toph says, and Zuko honestly loses it.</p>\n<p>\u201cToph!\u201d Katara gasps, laughing but scandalized.</p>\n<p>\u201cHoly spirits,\u201d Sokka cackles, and pats Zuko on the back as he wheezes. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen him laugh this hard.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCongratulations, you broke the Fire Lord.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOopsie.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSorry,\u201d Zuko clears his throat and tries again. \u201cI can ask the cooks to make it less spicy.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNah, I\u2019m not a bitch.\u201d Toph sucks up her noodles, and Aang laughs behind his hand.</p>\n<p>\u201cIs it really that bad?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d everyone answers.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe don\u2019t get many spices in the poles,\u201d Katara explains. \u201cWe mostly hunt animals and freeze the meat.\u201d \u00a0</p>\n<p>Zuko frowns. \u201cMaybe we need to rework our spice trade.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh no no no. You\u2019ll send the tribe into culture shock.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah. Sounds like you\u2019ll be doing enough of that as it is.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Zuko and Sokka share a look, and innocently resume their meal.</p>\n<p>\u201cHere comes the flying bison!\u201d Aang beams, and airbends a spoon of baby food into Bumi\u2019s mouth.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>With the cover of fireworks, Sokka takes his hand and holds it.</p>\n<p>Tonight marks the end of the week-long festival. Team Avatar has spent the last four days discussing business as a group, and to Zuko, his friends\u2019 advice has been invaluable. Each of them view the world a different way \u2013 through the eyes of the Avatar, the hands of a healer, or the feet of a metal-bending policewoman. After this, Zuko has a pretty good grasp on his goals for the Fire Nation.</p>\n<p>New, non-murderous dragon dancers circle the plaza.</p>\n<p>\u201cDancing used to be outlawed,\u201d Sokka notes, his face brightened with random bursts of fireworks. \u201cWhen did you change it?\u201d</p>\n<p>From up here, Zuko can see children dancing to folk music. Some are so young, they\u2019ve never known a single war in their life. That\u2019s the kind of future Zuko strives to keep.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhen I restored the sun festival,\u201d Zuko explains.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy\u2019d you do it?\u201d</p>\n<p>Zuko thumbs over the built-up callouses on Sokka\u2019s palm; the mark of a swordsman.</p>\n<p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know such a festival existed, until I found a history book buried at the back of the library. I asked Aang about it, and he said he remembered a time when the Fire Nation had some of the best dancers in the world. A time where people were always smiling.\u201d Zuko pauses as a yellow firework lights the sky. \u201cI wanted that world back.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sokka seems to think about that. He watches the sky, and then asks, \u201cDo you dance?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDefinitely not.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCome on, show me that sun warrior tango!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSokka,\u201d Zuko exasperates, and Sokka laughs and turns to hold his face in his hands.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re so cute sometimes, I can\u2019t even take it.\u201d</p>\n<p><em>Boom! </em>The firework rains down red and white crystals.</p>\n<p>Zuko\u2019s heart beats safely in his chest, behind a wall of muscle and scar and <em>hope. </em></p>\n<p>\u201cKiss me like I\u2019m water tribe,\u201d Zuko demands. Sokka\u2019s eyes widen, and this time they light up green and blue. Cheering and music and fireworks sound off below, but it all tunes out to nothing as Sokka steps up to him, and slides his hands to cradle Zuko\u2019s neck.</p>\n<p>\u201cKunik is more affectionate than romantic,\u201d Sokka warns.</p>\n<p>\u201cI want it anyways.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sokka brings their foreheads together, and purposefully bumps their noses. He breathes in \u2013 as if he\u2019s trying to memorize Zuko\u2019s scent \u2013 and tingles roll all the way to his toes. Sokka nuzzles his nose, then his cheek, and ends with a soft kiss to his forehead. Zuko opens his eyes, and Sokka\u2019s face is flushed red.</p>\n<p>Sokka steps back, stammering, \u201cUm\u2026 yeah. So, t-there.\u201d</p>\n<p>Zuko snatches Sokka by the waist, and hauls him in to kiss the Fire Nation way.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em>Dear Uncle. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u00a0</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Your advice was more valuable than you\u2019ll ever know. I guess we\u2019ll see where it goes from here. See you soon. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>--- \u00a0Zuko</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u00a0</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>At first, Zuko and King Kuei clashed over the fire nation colonies spread throughout the Earth kingdom \u2013 but Aang\u2019s suggestion to create the United Republic was the best possible outcome that Zuko never foresaw.</p>\n<p>Republic City just feels like the future. When he sees an earth kingdom woman chatting happily with her friends dressed in fire-nation red, Zuko starts to really have hope for this place.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s kind of surreal, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Sokka peeks out from the carriage window. \u201cThe buildings are so tall here.\u201d</p>\n<p>Zuko spits out Sokka\u2019s hair, and hauls him in his lap just so Sokka will stop leaning over him. He turns around cheekily, and fans his face.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh my, mister <em>lord.</em> What would the people think?\u201d</p>\n<p>Zuko rolls his eyes, leaning back in the carriage.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not bringing you places if you\u2019re going to act like this.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sokka sticks out his tongue, and Zuko tries to grab it, but Sokka dodges and laughs.</p>\n<p>\u201cAs the official Water Tribe representative of the United Republic Council, I must say I\u2019m scandalized.\u201d</p>\n<p>Zuko holds him at the ribs and kisses him. Sokka kisses back, open mouthed and gentle. Their lips are sticky from the bay humidity.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to be spending a lot of time here,\u201d Zuko points out.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo more than you. Oh look! Cabbage guy has a shop here! Wow that\u2019s a lot of cabbages\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHm. <em>Cabbage Corp? </em>Sounds like a stupid name.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAgreed.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Peace doesn\u2019t come easily. But they\u2019re getting there. Zuko wants to create a world that feels just as serene as mother\u2019s garden. It might be just a pipe dream; but they\u2019ve come too far to stop now.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>After a long, long struggle on Sokka\u2019s part, Zuko is finally convinced to crawl in the bath with him.</p>\n<p>This love is not accepted by many. But those who disagreed with his lifestyle were free to leave the palace, and now Zuko\u2019s council is filled with open-minded opportunists and hopeful dreamers \u2013 and that\u2019s what matters.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s hard to get Sokka this quiet. He\u2019s always talking about something, (even if it\u2019s nothing), and in these passing years Zuko has grown used to the background noise. If anything, he looks forward to it.</p>\n<p>But Sokka is quiet behind him, head lulled back on the tub, Zuko pulled tight to his chest. They\u2019re just skin on skin on skin, sticky and clean and relaxed. Both of them have their hair tied up high, but strands still stick to their cheeks from the steam.</p>\n<p>Zuko uses his hands to heat the water further. Sokka makes a happy noise behind him.</p>\n<p>\u201cSooo useful,\u201d he coos. Zuko gets his hands to a safe temperature, and kneads them into Sokka\u2019s bad leg, where he once broke it during the invasion. The sound Sokka makes is near pornographic.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re just using me,\u201d Zuko teases. Sokka makes a contemplative noise, and might\u2019ve mumbled an argument, but it sounds too sleepy to understand. It\u2019s okay. After everything Sokka has done for him, Zuko will heat all the baths he wants.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Sokka hates eating alone. It\u2019s lonely, it sucks, the food doesn\u2019t taste as good, and there\u2019s no sexy distraction from the fire nation spices trying to fry your brain through your sinuses.</p>\n<p>In fact, there is a very specific sexy distraction that Sokka is missing.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe Fire Lord isn\u2019t taking any visitors \u2013 \u201d the guard starts to say, but when Sokka removes his hood, the guard backpedals. \u201cForgive me, sir. Please enter.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I thought.\u201d</p>\n<p>The door swings open, and Sokka sneaks into the main hall.</p>\n<p>Agh, that dumbass.</p>\n<p>Zuko is half asleep on the throne. His head is lulled in his hand, and the dark circles under his eyes are at least two days old, and Sokka is <em>so </em>going to wring his attractive little neck.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh darling,\u201d Sokka calls sweetly, approaching the foot of the throne. \u201cYou\u2019re missing dinner.\u201d</p>\n<p>Zuko jolts upright.</p>\n<p>\u201cShit. What time is it?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSeven-thirty.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSorry,\u201d Zuko rubs his eyes. \u201cI\u2019m waiting on one last appointment.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell they\u2019re fucking late, and you look like hell.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p>\n<p>Well \u2013 it\u2019s part of the truth. Sokka knows what Zuko looks like at full health; but no matter what, Zuko looks sexy on that dumb throne. Legs spread, eyes downturned, hair long over his shoulder. Whenever Sokka spots the braid at his temple, he feels like he needs a dip in the arctic.</p>\n<p>Sokka kneels at his feet, and Zuko\u2019s eyes snap to him.</p>\n<p>\u201cI leave for one week, and you\u2019re already like this\u2026\u201d Sokka pets up his firm outer thighs, and looks up at Zuko through his lashes. \u201cI\u2019m right to worry about you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Zuko\u2019s face is unreadable to most, but Sokka sees the interest in his eyes.</p>\n<p>\u201cSorry. I wanted to get this done all at once so I\u2019d have more time with you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Awwwww. Sokka\u2019s heart does a little cartwheel, and he smiles cheekily.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s really sweet. I feel like good behavior should get rewarded.\u201d</p>\n<p>Zuko\u2019s eyes widen fractionally, and he stops Sokka by the wrist before he can reach for his sash.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m still waiting on that last meeting. Just eat without me, and we can do whatever you want tomorrow.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sokka pouts. He takes that hand and presses his lips to Zuko\u2019s fingertips.</p>\n<p>\u201cBut I\u2019m here <em>tonight.</em>\u201d Sokka folds his fingers and kisses his knuckles. \u201cI\u2019m right in front of you. Don\u2019t you want me?\u201d He watches Zuko swallow heavily, before he takes Zuko\u2019s fingers into his mouth and sucks.</p>\n<p><em>\u201cSokka,</em>\u201d Zuko rasps, and it\u2019s beautiful like always. He has this grainy tone \u2013 this bass he gets when he\u2019s interested, and it always rolls down Sokka\u2019s spine all tingly-like.</p>\n<p>Sokka takes him deep enough to spin his wedding ring with his tongue, before pulling back and pressing Zuko\u2019s wet hand to his neck, where the black and red betrothal necklace stays tight around his throat.</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you really going to make your <em>husband </em>beg?\u201d</p>\n<p>Zuko\u2019s expression is blank for a moment longer, before he grabs Sokka roughly by the neck and hauls him into his lap. Sokka goes up laughing, meeting his furious kisses with sweeter ones.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re supposed to encourage me to work,\u201d Zuko reminds.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m supposed to <em>encourage </em>you to let me blow you in this throne.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe spirits would absolutely curse us for that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIf they haven\u2019t already the last dozen times,\u201d Sokka mulls. Zuko sighs in defeat, and Sokka beams, nuzzling his nose and his cheek and breathing in happily. Zuko meets his kisses, and Sokka can\u2019t help but repeat, \u201cI love you, I love you,\u201d because it\u2019s true. It\u2019s <em>sooo </em>fucking true, it\u2019s embarrassing.</p>\n<p>Zuko noses over an old scar on his shoulder. Sokka loves the feeling of Zuko\u2019s hands up his back. It gives him goosebumps whenever Zuko decides to chase after something he wants.</p>\n<p>\u201cLove you too.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhen are you going to get me a baby?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSoon,\u201d Zuko promises.</p>\n<p>Sokka hums skeptically, and he taps Zuko\u2019s round lower lip with his finger as he teases.</p>\n<p>\u201cThen I guess we should get started on making one.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHa-ha,\u201d Zuko replies sarcastically, but they really do their damndest to try.</p>\n<p>Oh, this man. This absolute death of him.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou know,\u201d Iroh says. \u201cIt\u2019s a national crime for you to keep my great-niece away from me for so long.\u201d</p>\n<p>Izumi is a quiet girl, but she runs straight into Iroh\u2019s arms.</p>\n<p>\u201cIs that right?\u201d Sokka laughs.</p>\n<p>\u201cMust be a new rule,\u201d Zuko muses, automatically righting one of the tea shop chairs, and grabbing an apron off the wall.</p>\n<p>Izumi beams as Iroh lifts her in his arms.</p>\n<p>\u201cNow Zuko, you know you don\u2019t have to work <em>every </em>time,\u201d Iroh chuckles. Zuko gives him a hug, as does Sokka.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe likes to do it,\u201d Sokka says. \u201cYou know he insists on making all our own tea now?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou said you weren\u2019t going to tell him!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI lied.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAhhh, I see that good taste <em>does </em>run in the family,\u201d Iroh smiles. He squeezes Izumi\u2019s cheek, and she shyly hides in his neck. \u201cWell then, please prepare me something exquisite!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGrab the board, old man,\u201d Sokka yanks out a chair and straddles it backwards. \u201cI\u2019ve got a new strategy that\u2019s going to blow your sweaty sandals off.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDaddy,\u201d Izumi frowns, slipping out of Iroh\u2019s arms. \u201cI want to warm the tea.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCome here darling,\u201d Zuko calls. Sokka gets a dreamy look in his eye, and Zuko rolls his own, before collecting his daughter and showing her the pot.</p>\n<p>\u201cFirebender?\u201d Iroh asks.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Sokka smiles. \u201cShe just wants to do everything Zuko does. He\u2019s her hero right now.\u201d</p>\n<p>Iroh sets the board, and while his face has grown more wrinkles, his hands are no less steady.</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t be dismayed. One day, she will realize that <em>you </em>are her hero as well.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, I know,\u201d Sokka chirps. \u201cI\u2019m the best at fighting the bed monsters, isn\u2019t that right baby?\u201d</p>\n<p>Izumi nods with the teacup in her hand, \u201cMmhm!!\u201d</p>\n<p>Zuko covers her hands in his own, and the teapot heats gently. Sokka can see him bend down to whisper in her ear and point, and Izumi comes running with the tea.</p>\n<p>\u201cCareful,\u201d Zuko warns, and Izumi slows her step. Iroh eats it up completely \u2013 between Zuko\u2019s mother henning, and Izumi\u2019s eagerness to please, he makes a dramatic show of enjoying the tea.</p>\n<p>Sokka scoops Izumi up into his lap and lets her move the Pai Sho tiles, and it\u2019s a short memory in the book of life, but it sure is a good one.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>When uncle is ushered back in bed, and Izumi is conked out long past her bedtime, Zuko finds Sokka\u2019s fingers in the hall and asks, \u201cTake a walk with me?\u201d</p>\n<p>Sokka laughs, muffling it with a short kiss to keep quiet.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh my, a romantic stroll through <em>Ba Sing Se</em>? I\u2019m going to swoon.\u201d</p>\n<p>Zuko swats his ass.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWatch your pockets.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>"
