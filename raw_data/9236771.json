  "text": "<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cKnock knock!\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco starts slightly at the sudden, cheery greeting before automatically smiling at sight of the visitor.</p>\n<p>\u201cPansy!\u201d He grins before suddenly looking alarmed. \u201cDid we make plans that I\u2019ve forgotten about?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t I have you by your bollocks right now if that were the case, darling?\u201d Pansy breezes in, walking effortlessly on six-inch long pencil heels in sparkly silver, her salmon pink dress tight enough that Draco wondered if she could breathe at all in it. \u201cNo, I just missed your pretty face; it\u2019s been ages.\u201d She frowns as he stands and kisses her cheek.</p>\n<p>\u201cI know, I know,\u201d he groans, falling back into his seat and letting himself sag back for a few seconds in a rare display of exhaustion. \u201cI\u2019ve been--\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBusy, yes, I thought it was safe to assume.\u201d She rolls her eyes as she inspects the silver framed photograph of Draco\u2019s parents on his desk. \u201cIt\u2019s why I thought it was time to rescue you for a bit \u2013 let\u2019s go get an early lunch,\u201d she says brightly.</p>\n<p>\u201cShit, Pans, I wish I could.\u201d Draco looks desperately apologetic. \u201cBut I\u2019m just--\u201d He seemingly struggles for words as he indicates to his vast mahogany desk that was covered in sheets and sheets of paperwork, dozens of files, some lying open and spilling out more sheets of paperwork, three mobile phones, two of them charging, his laptop open and revealing him to be in the middle of typing out what looked to be an incredibly dull, interminable email, \u201c--<em>inundated</em>,\u201d he finally sighs.</p>\n<p>Pansy rolls her eyes. \u201cI <em>told</em> you,\u201d she says with a scowl, crossing her arms, enormous handbag hanging off the crook of one. \u201cYou rushed too quickly into this whole taking-over-the-family-business business. It\u2019s not like your father was hurrying you into it \u2013 you\u2019re all of twenty five. You\u2019re wasting prime years, darling.\u201d She perches on the desk, her arse landing right on top of a large green file.</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t sit on that.\u201d Draco hurries to yank the file out from her silk clad bum. \u201cI\u2019ll need it for my meeting with James Potter today,\u201d he grumbles, straightening out the small sheaf of papers that had folded over and creased under her.</p>\n<p>\u201cJames Potter?\u201d Pansy looks astonished. \u201cAs in, billionaire hotelier James Potter?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe very same.\u201d The smug pride in his voice makes her snort loudly. \u201cWhat? I have <em>one</em> meeting to knock his socks off,\u201d he says heatedly to her. \u201cEven Father never managed to secure a contract with <em>him</em>, so imagine me snagging Potter\u2019s next project \u2013 and it\u2019s going to be right here in London.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWow,\u201d Pansy intones, her expression wooden. \u201cWhen was the last time you got shagged, darling?\u201d she adds abruptly, apropos nothing.</p>\n<p>Draco splutters for a moment. \u201cWha-- how is that relevant to our conversation?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI can\u2019t remember the last time you were this excited about a man.\u201d She looks slightly disgusted.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m plenty excited about my men, thank you.\u201d Draco sniffs.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhen was the last time?\u201d</p>\n<p>He ignores her and turns back to his laptop though Pansy couldn\u2019t have missed that slight pink tinge on his high cheekbones even if she\u2019d been standing across the room.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh my god, <em>when?!</em>\u201d Her voice rises shrilly.</p>\n<p>\u201cEight months, give or take,\u201d he snaps without looking at her. When she doesn\u2019t reply for several seconds, he finally sneaks a glance. She looks horrified.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re--\u201d She flounders for words. \u201cYou-- that\u2019s a joke,\u201d she finally declares. \u201cYou\u2019re joking, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p>\n<p>He scowls. \u201cDon\u2019t feel like you have to stick around.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cEight <em>months?!</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSeriously, you can leave now, thank you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, <em>Draco</em>.\u201d She presses a hand over her ample bosom, inch long talons painted a lurid pink. \u201cOh, poor <em>darling</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI hate you,\u201d Draco snaps just as the intercom on his desk crackles to life.</p>\n<p>\u201cMr. Malfoy.\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco reaches over and presses a little silver button. \u201cYes, Lydia?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAlison from Mr. Potter\u2019s office just called.\u201d His assistant\u2019s voice floats up at them. \u201cHe can\u2019t make it for your two pm; she asked if you\u2019re free around four?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFour is fine, I\u2019ll reschedule with Peterson, tell them four\u2019s fine,\u201d he says frantically.</p>\n<p>\u201cI took the liberty of telling her that already, Mr. Malfoy.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI love you, I\u2019m going to buy you something pretty,\u201d he says in relief and hears the woman on the other side laugh.</p>\n<p>Pansy makes an impatient sound to regain his attention and so he looks up at her wearily.</p>\n<p>\u201cCan we just... <em>please</em> go out and get you a man tonight?\u201d She clasps her hands beseechingly. \u201cJust for tonight, just for a quick fuck in the gents\u2019, darling, you did so used to enjoy those.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPure class, Parkinson.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Or</em>... I could just send you a lovely little surprise!\u201d She claps her hands once as she gets to her feet, looking utterly delighted with her own idea. \u201cOh, that\u2019s <em>it!</em> I\u2019ll send one over; I know your type, I know just how you like--\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPlease be joking,\u201d Draco says weakly. \u201cNot even a year since Father retired and you\u2019re going to send his son hookers to his office?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t say <em>hooker</em>, darling, how crass.\u201d Pansy frowns, one hand on her hip.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, <em>that\u2019s</em> crass?!\u201d Draco\u2019s voice rises incredulously.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Pansy blinks. \u201cOh, nothing about anyone I send you will be crass, don\u2019t you worry, you know how posh my \u2018contacts\u2019 can be--\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay, off you go.\u201d Draco gets to his feet and takes Pansy firmly by the arm. \u201cLovely of you to pop in, such a delight and all that.\u201d He walks her briskly to the door even as she starts to list out the health benefits of an active sex life and why friends like her are so rare.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo, you\u2019re usually in here until six? Seven?\u201d she asks brightly just before Draco slams the door in her face. \u201cKeep some lube handy, darling!\u201d comes the muffled instruction from the other side and Draco lets out a high pitched squeak.</p>\n<p>\u201cGo away, Pans, seriously!\u201d he yells at the door. \u201cFucking hell.\u201d He settles back down in his chair, staunchly not acknowledging how even the mere thought of lube made his cock stir and his arse clench.</p>\n<p><em>God</em>, he needs to get laid.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cMr. Malfoy.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, Lydia.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAlison from Mr. Potter\u2019s office just called again.\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco checks his watch \u2013 just past seven \u2013 and then sighs, pinching the bridge of his nose between forefinger and thumb.</p>\n<p>\u201cLet me guess \u2013 Mr. Potter isn\u2019t free to meet with me today after all.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShe said to tell you that he\u2019s terribly sorry and would like to meet with you first thing tomorrow. I\u2019ve told her nine am is good and Paul will drive you straight there in the morning.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThank you, Lydia.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you need me to stick around?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, run along.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGoodnight, sir.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2019night.\u201d</p>\n<p>What an utter waste of a day, Draco grouses. He has nothing but respect for James Potter and knows that the old man is a terribly busy person but he\u2019d rescheduled <em>thrice</em> with Draco today, making him rearrange several other appointments to fit him in each time, and now he\u2019d cancelled.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s tempted to ring Pansy and ask to meet for drinks right away but then that bint would immediately go about her way finding a one night stand for Draco no matter where they went and honestly, despite being almost permanently randy these days, Draco didn\u2019t have the energy to put on his charming social mask on and flirt long enough just to get some random bloke\u2019s cock in his arse. He\u2019s tired and simply wants to head home and go to bed.</p>\n<p>\u201cChrist, you desperately need a life, old chap,\u201d he says to his reflection in his laptop screen that had timed out.</p>\n<p>Sighing once again, he taps the touchpad a couple of times till the screen blinks back on and then decides to send out one final email before heading home.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s got three files open before him for reference and is completely immersed in the closing paragraph of his rather snappy email when there\u2019s a quiet knock.</p>\n<p>\u201cDraco Malfoy?\u201d comes a soft voice before he\u2019s actually registered the knock and called out permission to enter.</p>\n<p>He looks up and inhales a quick, sharp breath at the sight of the man standing before him.</p>\n<p>\u201cMr. Malfoy?\u201d he repeats, his voice slow and deep.</p>\n<p>Tall, burly, incredibly well dressed.</p>\n<p>\n<em>Pansy, you incorrigible bitch.</em>\n</p>\n<p>Smart, neat suit in a black that\u2019s somehow soft on the eyes, pale, pistachio green shirt inside, top button left undone \u2013 no tie. Well polished black oxfords and silver cuff links.</p>\n<p>\n<em>Oh my, Pansy, just where do you find these guys?</em>\n</p>\n<p>Thick, barely tamed head of jet black locks.</p>\n<p>\n<em>You bint, you know I have a thing for brunets.</em>\n</p>\n<p>Rugged, angular jaw and a rounded chin.</p>\n<p>\n<em>God, look at him, Pansy, I hate you.</em>\n</p>\n<p>Eyes in an <em>impossibly</em> vivid shade of green.</p>\n<p>\n<em>Fuck it, nobody deserves a good fuck more than I do right now. Thank you, Pans.</em>\n</p>\n<p>He affects a sigh and leans back in his chair.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, that\u2019s me,\u201d Draco says mock resignedly. \u201cThat stupid bint never listens, does she?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI beg your pardon?\u201d The man tilts his head slightly, thick brows drawing together in apparent confusion.</p>\n<p>Draco waves one hand carelessly as he gets to his feet, feasting his eyes over the tall, wide man before him as he rounds his desk and slowly approaches the wall to wall windows, ignoring the marvellous, panoramic view of the city outside, the moon hanging in a fuzzy sickle over tip of The Gherkin. Draco sighs again, leaning a shoulder into the glass while still facing his visitor. \u201cShe means well.\u201d He smiles. \u201cI mean, look at you,\u201d he says kindly. \u201cYou barely even look the part. Do you always dress like this, or did Pansy pay you to for me?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I really don\u2019t under--\u201d The man presses a hand flat to his chest and has a slightly bemused smile. \u201cI\u2019m-- my name is--\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco, meanwhile, is taking in the sight of his hands. Long, thick fingers, a light sprinkling of dark hair over the back of each digit \u2013 they\u2019d feel criminally good inside him, Draco knew.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, no need for that,\u201d Draco interrupts quickly, shaking his head with a smile. \u201cI enjoy the anonymity of it, as I\u2019m sure you do as well,\u201d he adds coyly, slowly taking his jacket off.</p>\n<p>The man before him blinks, licks his lips and regards him through slightly narrowed eyes, as if considering something very carefully.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, don\u2019t just stand there,\u201d Draco teases. \u201cI was just heading home, so this will have to be quick. Just for Pansy\u2019s sake, considering she went through all that trouble.\u201d He carefully lays his jacket over the armrest of the plush sofa in front of him. \u201cGo on, you can\u2019t possibly be shy.\u201d He rolls his eyes. \u201cAre you new?\u201d he adds when the man still doesn\u2019t show signs of undressing.</p>\n<p>The man\u2019s lips twitch, eyes sparkling with a sudden something, and he slowly undoes his jacket button, slipping the garment off his shoulders, hands casually lifting to unbutton his shirt.</p>\n<p>Draco, on the verge of undressing himself further, pauses, his eyes hungrily fixed on the <em>fantastic</em> body slowly being revealed, inch by inch. Tight pectoral muscles, deliciously hard, flat abdominal muscles, rippling biceps, and shoulders, oh they were a story by themselves altogether \u2013 Draco could spend <em>hours</em> nibbling on those bulging shoulder muscles.</p>\n<p>The renter unbuttons his cuffs, pulls out the shirt tails and lets the shirt slowly slip off, letting it sail to the floor, his hands already unbuckling his belt.</p>\n<p>Draco holds his breath as the trouser button is popped open, frowning when the hands stop after that, hovering in place. He looks back up at the handsome face to find the man looking at him with one eyebrow raised, viridian gaze twinkling mischievously.</p>\n<p>\u201cAm I to help you undress, sir?\u201d he asks, and Draco smirks.</p>\n<p>\u201cEager,\u201d he drawls. \u201cI rather like that. It can be terribly dull otherwise, like being fucked by a robot.\u201d Draco lazily unbuttons his shirt, rolling his eyes.</p>\n<p>\u201cI can see how that might be disappointing.\u201d The other man slowly approaches Draco, until he\u2019s finally stood right in front of him.</p>\n<p>Lifting large, square hands, he gently pushes aside Draco\u2019s hands and undoes the last few buttons on his shirt, leaning in as he drew it off him, his warm breath ghosting over Draco\u2019s collar bones, and then his bare shoulder.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, you\u2019re one of those gentle giants,\u201d Draco sighs, his hands automatically coming up to splay across the hard shoulder blades. \u201cPride yourself on tender, lingering fucks, do you?\u201d A soft, breathy laugh escapes him as a warm, moist tongue slowly skates up his neck. \u201cOh, I wish I had that kind of time, love--\u201d</p>\n<p>With no sort of warning whatsoever, Draco is spun around and slammed cheek first into the glass, his breath leaving him in a loud gasp, his arms flailing out wildly as he tries to catch his balance.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat the-?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cJust speeding things up, sir.\u201d A glib whisper in his ear as his trousers are shoved down, all the way down, the elastic of his pants catching on his half-hard cock as the guy peels those down too, falling to his knees behind Draco with a soft thud. \u201cAt the risk of being labelled audacious, might I just say that you possess a rather phenomenal arse, sir.\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco might have liked to preen at that, might have liked to return the compliment with a snarky, yet kind, comment. He might have liked to throw his head back and chime one of those modestly flattered laughs he\u2019d mastered by the time he was twenty one and men had begun anxiously vying for his attention.</p>\n<p>He might have at least liked to simply thank the man for his astute observation, because yes, Draco <em>did</em> have a singularly stunning arse.</p>\n<p>But he\u2019s not really given much of a chance to do any of that \u2013 not given a chance to even dredge up further thought, basically.</p>\n<p>For right after he bestows that slightly cunning sounding bit of praise on Draco, the man on his knees behind Draco firmly prises his arse open and unceremoniously sticks his tongue into him.</p>\n<p>Nails scrabbling helplessly on the glass under his hands, Draco gasps in shrill shock, rising onto tip-toes and moaning loudly, his cock nudging the cool surface before him. His breath instantly shortens and he lets out short, sharp gasps that fog up the window, blurring his own reflection, twinkling city lights fuzzy around the edges. The tongue inside him licks its way out, there\u2019s a pause as his cheeks are pushed wider apart, two thumbs holding his hole open, fingers bruising his flesh, and then it\u2019s back inside him, a low hum added to the mix for good measure, making Draco curse and cant his hips out.</p>\n<p>He presses his damp forehead into the glass and reaches one hand back, pushing his fingers into the wild mess of hair, whimpering slightly as he\u2019s sucked loose, realising with mounting shame that he\u2019s already so, <em>so</em> fucking <em>close</em>.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou do, at some point in the night \u2013 <em>oh!</em> \u2013 intend to fuck me, yes?\u201d he gasps out, helplessly slapping his hand on the window as quick, rough strokes are painted over his arsehole. \u201cSeriously, chop chop.\u201d</p>\n<p>He hears an amused snort against the inner curve of his arse cheek, the puddle of his trousers and pants being unwound from around his ankles and pushed away along with his shoes. And then the man is getting to his feet.</p>\n<p>Draco watches their reflection on the window, the way the brunet looms over him, their shapes dark against the night outside, gold and bronze city lights blinking prettily. He moans again when he\u2019s pressed more firmly into the cool glass, his erection trapped between the window and his own stomach, the tips of two fingers nudging sneakily into him.</p>\n<p>\u201cTerribly sorry, but I\u2019m afraid I don\u2019t have any lube on me,\u201d the renter murmurs quietly into Draco\u2019s ear, making him shiver lightly at the gust of warm, cigarette scented breath against his neck.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s mighty hind-sighted of you, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Draco groans at the sinfully delicious burn as the fingers continue to push forward, sinking deeper into him; he clenches reflexively and hears a sharp intake of breath behind him. \u201cThere\u2019s- there\u2019s some in the bottom left drawer.\u201d Draco is shaking now, and knows he can\u2019t make it to the table and back without his knees buckling.</p>\n<p>The fingers disappear and Draco whines at the loss, blinking rapidly to try and clear the thick fog that seems to have clouded his mind in just those few minutes of being rimmed \u2013 rimmed with <em>astounding</em> skill, one had to admit.</p>\n<p>He pants softly with his eyes closed, forehead resting on the glass again, and hears the smooth slide of the drawer being pulled open, a brief, noisy search, and then the drawer thudding shut again.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s grateful that the brunet just gets right back to it \u2013 he\u2019s on the brink of shamelessly desperate begging and had the bloke dilly-dallied, tried to tease him with light, feathery touches, Draco knew he\u2019d have made a complete fool of himself.</p>\n<p>But oh no, he gets straight down to it and the throaty groan Draco emits when two, lube-slicked fingers cleave their way back into him is partly filled with gratitude.</p>\n<p>\u201cFuck.\u201d He jerks as another finger immediately squeezes in with the first two, and the brunet quickly lowers his mouth to Draco\u2019s neck, placing gentle, wet kisses that contrast sharply with the, now, merciless pumps of his fingers into Draco. One large hand appears from behind him to press into the glass above their heads, a rather ostentatious watch catching Draco\u2019s eye for a second right before his prostate is flicked at, making him cry out and buck back for more.</p>\n<p>He immediately gets more, the man leaning his weight into his fingers, fucking them in and out in rough, determined stabs that have Draco throwing his head back onto one flexing shoulder and shuddering.</p>\n<p>\u201cToo much?\u201d the man asks belatedly in a soft voice, and Draco sobs out a short laugh.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt was, when a minute ago when you thought shoving three fingers in almost at once was a good idea,\u201d he pants, greedily bucking his arse onto the fingers.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd now?\u201d he prompts, soft lips brushing the shell of Draco\u2019s ear.</p>\n<p>\u201cPerfect,\u201d Draco whimpers as his prostate is firmly massaged. \u201cOh, good <em>god!</em>\u201d He arches as he readily accepts a fourth finger, widening his stance and pressing clammy hands into the glass, smudging finger prints all over it. The fingers thrust in and out, stuffing him full, lightly twisting this way and that, stretching him exquisitely wide, pushing him way too close to the brink. \u201cI- I really need you to--\u201d He can\u2019t bring himself to finish as the rest of his breath leaves him in a shuddering sigh, his cock now weeping in a long trickle down the pane of glass.</p>\n<p>\u201cRight away, sir,\u201d comes the sultry chuckle before there\u2019s a squelch as the four meaty fingers are wrested out of him. It\u2019s obscenely loud and terribly lewd in the otherwise silent room and Draco inexplicably feels his face heat as he\u2019s turned around by the shoulders.</p>\n<p>Hissing softly as his sweaty back comes in contact with the chilly surface behind him, Draco tries his hardest best to press forward into the hard, chiselled body that\u2019s pinning him tightly. Pausing only to undo the renter\u2019s flies and push the expertly tailored trousers and black boxers down his thighs, Draco runs quick hands over the straight sides and teasingly drags his teeth over the smooth chin, gasping out a laugh of surprise when he\u2019s suddenly lifted off his feet.</p>\n<p>\u201cWrap your legs around me,\u201d the brunet murmurs into his cheek, his lips sliding lower, making Draco involuntarily turn his face slightly, edging his own mouth closer.</p>\n<p>\u201cPerfectly good sofa right over there, you know,\u201d Draco breathes back even as he obeys and brings his legs around tapered hips, quivering as he feels an unmistakably large shaft slip in between his thighs, momentarily brushing his own straining erection.</p>\n<p>\u201cMore fun this way, isn\u2019t it, the whole city laid out for us,\u201d the other man whispers before suddenly catching Draco\u2019s mouth in his.</p>\n<p>Draco moans \u2013 god, it\u2019s one thing to not have had a cock up his arse in eight months, but it\u2019s a whole other thing to have waited this long for good, thorough snog.</p>\n<p>Slanting his head, he lets the tongue push in, twisting and jabbing his own tongue against the one in his mouth. Draco moans again, letting the silky, ebony strands slip through his fingers, tightening his legs around him in a wordless plea.</p>\n<p>Pulling wet lips away, the brunet busies himself with pulling his wallet out the back pocket of his trousers, carefully reaching down the back of his thigh for it, holding Draco firmly with his other hand. Draco barely has time to notice the shockingly thick wad of money in the rather expensive looking leather wallet, before he\u2019s distracted by the sight of the XL sized lubricated condom being pulled out.</p>\n<p>Throwing the wallet aside carelessly onto the sofa, the brunet tears open the packet with his teeth, and leans back slightly, holding Draco pinned in place with his hips. And then Draco looks down and finally catches sight of the monstrosity he\u2019s about to have buried up his arse, gaping down at it in spluttering wonder.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Where</em> did Pansy <em>find</em> you?!\u201d he asks incredulously, watching the man expertly roll the rubber on before hiking Draco higher up the window pane, worming one hand between them, lining himself up.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, you know... About,\u201d he answers casually, before suddenly grinning.</p>\n<p>\u201cCheeky bastard.\u201d Draco\u2019s eyes widen as the head bumps against his entrance, after which he has a mere two seconds to wrap his arms around the vast shoulders and hold on for dear life.</p>\n<p>For the man spares no time for gentle, persuading nudges \u2013 he slots himself firmly in place and snaps his hips forward with a soft grunt, ramming himself home in one thrust.</p>\n<p>Draco is glad he sent Lydia home because the yowling scream that rips itself out his throat would have surely alarmed the poor woman. He\u2019s shaking violently, moaning out desperate gasps, his arse twitching and clenching as it tries to both hold in and push out the immense cock in it. The brunet pants roughly into his neck, squeezing large handfuls of Draco\u2019s arse.</p>\n<p>\u201cI know I was the one insisting on getting on with it,\u201d Draco chokes out, letting his head fall back, \u201cbut, <em>really</em>... this is-- you\u2019re--\u201d He tries really hard to find something to complain about but who\u2019s he kidding, he\u2019s always fucking <em>loved</em> a good burn and Christ, he needs <em>more</em>. \u201cOh god, just <em>fuck</em> me,\u201d he groans against the rugged jaw, gripping tightly around the thickness inside him.</p>\n<p>With a hiss of appreciation, the bloke draws out, pauses only to close his mouth over Draco\u2019s in another searing kiss, and then slams back in, not releasing Draco\u2019s mouth even as\u00a0he screams powerlessly.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>He\u2019s going to have to buy Pansy <em>diamonds</em> for this, because this, oh fuck, this just <em>has</em> to be literally the <em>best fuck of his goddamned life</em>. Firm, thorough thrusts that drag past his prostate at just the perfect fucking angle; the hard, deep kiss, tongues furiously jabbing and twisting, that goes on and on through the relentless assault on his tender arse \u2013 god, for this, Pansy deserved anything she could possibly think of.</p>\n<p>And then, with a scratchy groan of his own, the brunet releases Draco\u2019s mouth to throw his head back, stubbled jaw clenching as he grit his teeth. \u201cSo- fucking- tight,\u201d he ground out with each, ruthless thrust.</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2019m coming, don\u2019stop-\u201d Draco\u2019s words run into one another as he gasps out the warning, his balls throbbing, his whole body seizing up. His back bows off the window as the world fades out into nothing \u2013 he barely even feels the following few thrusts into him as he simply <em>comes</em>.</p>\n<p>And it\u2019s quite honestly the most intense orgasm of Draco\u2019s life, he has no small doubt about that. His whole body lurches upwards with each spurt of his cock, his nails embedded in the hard muscle of the sweaty back under his hands.</p>\n<p>When his ears finally seem to pop open, like they did after one got off a long flight, he\u2019s aware of harsh, ragged panting, faintly registering that there are two separate sets of panting and then realising that his was one of them.</p>\n<p>The brunet has his face in Draco\u2019s neck as he pants and his hips still shift lightly back and forth as he continues to rock his cock into Draco, riding out the last of his climax. Closing his hand around one fistful of shaggy black hair, Draco yanks his head back gently, kissing him messily, tongue and all, for several breathless minutes. The man presses forward as he kisses Draco back hungrily and Draco can feel his own back sticking wetly to the glass.</p>\n<p>When he\u2019s finally placed back on his feet, his knees promptly give away and he\u2019s quickly lifted back up with a soft chuckle. He scowls lightly as he\u2019s laid out over the sofa instead, but then leans back into the cushions with a grateful sigh, watching the hunk peel off and trash the condom before pulling his clothes back on with slow, lazy movements.</p>\n<p>\u201cDo all your prospective business associates get to indulge in a little treat like that?\u201d he asks in his deep, husky voice, tucking his light green shirt into his trousers, watching his reflection in the window pane, bright viridian\u00a0eyes flicking over to look at Draco as he spoke.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Draco stretches languidly, feeling like he could happily just fall asleep right there, naked and covered in his own come. Then realising he\u2019d been asked a question he looks over at his visitor. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, pardon me?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, I just wondered if I should start feeling jealous of all the others, or if I ought to fervently thank you for the honour.\u201d The brunet picks up his jacket and shakes it out, folds it over one arm and then grins at Draco.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d Draco sighs, massaging the nape of his neck.</p>\n<p>The man chews on the inside of his cheek for a few seconds, his eyes twinkling in a rather wicked way as he stares at Draco. \u201cI feel like you\u2019re not going to take this very well,\u201d he finally says. \u201cWould you like to put some clothes on before I break it to you?\u201d He looks like he\u2019s going to burst out laughing any second.</p>\n<p>Draco opens his eyes and stares in silence for a few seconds. \u201cBreak what to me?\u201d he finally asks carefully, his gut suddenly clenching uncomfortably, prompting him to sit up and grab his jacket off the armrest and quickly shrug it on, holding it closed around himself.</p>\n<p>\u201cI feel like you\u2019re under the impression that I\u2019m some sort of...\u201d The man drifts off, a small grin creeping onto his face.</p>\n<p>\u201cA renter,\u201d Draco says slowly. \u201cYou\u2019re a renter sent here by my idiot friend Pansy--\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAh, yes, you mentioned her before,\u201d The man looks thoughtful. \u201cPansy Parkinson? Proteus Parkinson\u2019s daughter, isn\u2019t she?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHow do you know that?\u201d Draco narrows his eyes. \u201cLook here, are you some sort of creep--\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m Harry Potter,\u201d the man says, interrupting him calmly. \u201cJames Potter\u2019s son?\u201d He hooks one eyebrow up. \u201cPansy was in my year back in college, that\u2019s how I know,\u201d he adds casually and Draco is suddenly scrambling to his feet, something that felt like acid flooding his insides.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou- you\u2019re <em>who?!</em>\u201d he asks hoarsely, his throat feeling like he\u2019d swallowed a mouthful of sand.</p>\n<p>\u201cHarry Potter,\u201d he repeats patiently. \u201cYou were supposed to meet with dad today and he had to cancel \u2013 several times. He felt awful about it and asked me if I\u2019d come meet you for a quick briefing before your meeting tomorrow \u2013 and to personally apologise.\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco tries to swallow, his panicked brain trying to come up with some possible loop hole. \u201cBut-- but you\u2019re in the States,\u201d he says rather blankly. \u201cYou\u2019re in the States, drinking away your father\u2019s money.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, well,\u201d Potter speaks on a laugh. \u201cI thought it was high time I head back home and rid myself of the less than flattering reputation of a party-boy that I seem to\u2019ve earned over the last few years.\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco is horrified to suddenly realise he has to throw up \u2013 no, wait, he\u2019s horrified to realise he\u2019s still mostly naked in front of this man \u2013 <em>no</em>, he\u2019s horrified to realise that he just had sex with James Potter\u2019s <em>son</em>.</p>\n<p><em>He\u2019d treated James Potter\u2019s son like he was a renter</em> \u2013 he\u2019d begged James Potter\u2019s son to <em>fuck him up the arse</em>.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh god,\u201d he whispers, suddenly sitting back down, not even feeling the dull throb that pulses tantalisingly up his arse. Potter steps forward, momentary concern evident in his eyes but that wicked smile back on his lips. \u201cOh, Jesus <em>Christ!</em>\u201d Draco buries his flushed face in his hands, his stomach still churning nauseatingly.</p>\n<p>He hears a low chuckle and his head snaps up, a low snarl of sorts escaping him as he took in the sight of the smug, arrogantly handsome face.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou <em>bastard</em>,\u201d he hisses, leaping back up to his feet, even as a slightly calmer voice in his head advises him not to insult James Potter\u2019s son to his face. \u201cWhat were you-- why did you-- couldn\u2019t you <em>say</em> something?!</p>\n<p>Potter actually laughs <em>at</em> him, looking endlessly amused. \u201cI tried to, but you just wouldn\u2019t shut up.\u201d He holds up his hands as if in surrender when Draco takes one threatening step towards him, before he abruptly remembers his, well, <em>nakedness</em>, and stops himself going further.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis is <em>not</em> funny!\u201d he yells, feeling like he just might just burst into mortified tears. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you just tell me who-- why on <em>earth</em> did you go <em>on</em> with it?!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cForgive me for being candid, but have you looked in a mirror?\u201d Potter asks politely, eyes still twinkling. \u201cI doubt any bent man could refuse when someone who looks like you--\u201d he very deliberately rakes his gaze down Draco\u2019s body, eyes darkening briefly, \u201c--asks to be buggered good and proper.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI did <em>not</em>--\u201d Draco begins loudly, his face heating, before he forces himself to lower his voice and calm down a little. \u201cAre you sure you\u2019re Harry Potter?\u201d he grits. \u201cBecause I sort of believed that the son of such a refined, well respected gentleman would possess more class than that of a poxy charva.\u201d</p>\n<p>Potter chuckles again. \u201cPretty <em>and</em> witty,\u201d he says softly, walking towards Draco who in turn hurriedly stumbles back, falling back down onto the sofa in a sprawl. Potter rolls his eyes, grabbing his wallet up from the sofa, winks lasciviously at him and turns to leave. \u201cMy father really <em>is</em> sorry, by the way.\u201d He pauses with his hand on the doorknob, turning around to throw another devilish grin at Draco. \u201cGood luck for your meeting with him tomorrow.\u201d He opens the door and steps out.</p>\n<p><em>Please don\u2019t tell your father</em>, Draco wants to desperately shout out to him. But he merely glares at him as the green eyed devil makes his way out of his office, ignoring the reflexive shiver of excitement that goes up his spine at the final torrid glance thrown his way.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s a children\u2019s play pool,\u201d Draco says slowly, looking down his nose at the idiot in front of him. \u201c<em>Why </em>would it be six feet deep?!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThere was an error in the blueprints, I believe--\u201d the man mumbles meekly, not looking up at Draco.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd had I not decided to come in for a surprise inspection, you\u2019d have built the hotel a six-foot deep children\u2019s pool?!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI- I--\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAh, Draco!\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco whips around irritably before quickly schooling his expression into one of cool politeness. \u201cMr. Potter,\u201d he says courteously as a tall, thin man in a neat\u00a0grey Armani suit, with head of thick, salt and pepper hair, and twinkling hazel eyes behind elegant rectangular framed spectacles strides up to him, shaking Draco\u2019s hand with both of his own. Draco smiles but looks somewhere above the man\u2019s left ear \u2013 the resemblance is unnerving and he can\u2019t bring himself to look him right in the face.</p>\n<p>\u201cHow are things?\u201d James Potter asks kindly, looking around and up at the under-construction hotel. \u201cEverything on schedule?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cEverything on schedule,\u201d Draco assures him. \u201cI didn\u2019t know you\u2019re going to be stopping by, or I\u2019d have had a progress report made--\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, no need for that, my boy.\u201d The older man waves his hand casually. \u201cWe were just passing by, and my son--\u201d He suddenly looks over his shoulder; Draco follows his gaze and feels like he\u2019s about to go into cardiac arrest because at that very moment, Harry Potter strolls into sight.</p>\n<p>His crisp white shirt, sleeves rolled back to his elbows, the collar and top button left open again, is tucked into khaki trousers and he\u2019s wearing gold rimmed aviator sunglasses in a dark brown, his hands in his pockets, sun glinting off his Bvlgari watch as he slowly looks around the construction site.</p>\n<p>Draco stares helplessly even as the nausea returns in full strength because, fuck, he\u2019d not been wrong in recalling Harry Potter to be <em>exceedingly</em> hot.</p>\n<p>\u201cHarry,\u201d Potter Sr. calls out. \u201cHe wanted to pop in for a quick looksie,\u201d he adds to Draco who just <em>stands</em> there, his hands clenched into fists as his heart gallops up his chest and into his throat.</p>\n<p>Harry Potter walks up to them and it takes him several seconds to realise who his father stands with. When he finally does focus on Draco\u2019s face, he whips off his sunglasses, his eyes widening the tiniest bit before gleaming with unfiltered, evil glee.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis is Draco, Lucius Malfoy\u2019s son,\u201d James introduces them and then Harry sticks his fucking hand out for Draco to shake. \u201cThis is my son, Harry.\u201d</p>\n<p>As slowly as he can dare to in the current situation, Draco brings his hand up only for the fucking savage wanker to grab on to his smaller, pale white hand and practically crush it with his own large, lightly tanned, warm hand, grinning widely at him as he did so.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Really</em> pleased to meet you,\u201d he says, tucking his sunglasses into the front of his shirt, and Draco <em>swears</em> he can hear the hint of a maniacal laugh in his friendly tone.</p>\n<p>\u201cLikewise,\u201d Draco replies through a grit smile.</p>\n<p>\u201cA highly competent young man, our Draco,\u201d James continues warmly. \u201cA sedulous perfectionist like Lucius having handed over Malfoy Constructions to him is proof enough, I suppose.\u201d He smiles, and Draco is so rattled at the other man standing in front of him that he can\u2019t even contently bask in the praise.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, yes, I\u2019ve heard only good things about him,\u201d Harry quips to his father, and Draco wants to hop furiously on the spot to release the pent up tension.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou know, Harry here is around your age.\u201d Potter Sr. raises an eyebrow at his son. \u201cHe was supposed to meet with you a few months ago, actually,\u201d he adds suddenly, and Draco has to consciously remind himself to <em>keep breathing</em>. \u201cOn that unfortunate day I had to repeatedly reschedule our first meeting?\u201d James looks for confirmation to Harry, who nods, biting his lip over another grin and quickly looking down. \u201cYes, he went over to your office, but you\u2019d apparently left for the day. I\u2019ve actually been rather eager for him to meet you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019ve-- why?\u201d Draco finally unsticks his throat enough to speak, relief filling him up to the tips of his fingers and toes \u2013 so the tosser had kept mum.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, I\u2019d hoped that spending time with you would inspire the boy to consider taking over his own family business as well,\u201d James says in a flat tone. \u201cWhat do you say, son?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, I\u2019d <em>love</em> to spend some time with him, one on one.\u201d Harry doesn\u2019t even bother to mask the intensely heated stare he pins Draco down with, so it was probably a good thing that Potter Sr.\u2019s mobile phone started to ring at that point.</p>\n<p>The older man excuses himself and walks a short distance away to answer the call and Harry shifts imperceptibly closer, standing shoulder-to-shoulder with Draco, their elbows brushing as he turned to face the building that was coming up.</p>\n<p>\u201cI took a look at the plans, they\u2019re great,\u201d he says casually.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll pass along the compliment to our architects,\u201d Draco answers stiffly. He hears a snort but the man next to him doesn\u2019t say anything further.</p>\n<p>Then Potter sighs. \u201cLook,\u201d he says softly, \u201cI realised later on that I was rather horrible to you \u2013 I\u2019m sorry.\u201d Draco looks around in unmasked surprise and Potter grins, mussing his hair up carelessly. \u201cYeah, I should\u2019ve told you who I am. It was honestly awful, what I did, and I really am sorry.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNot <em>all</em> of it was awful,\u201d Draco mumbles without thinking and then vehemently curses himself as Potter rumbles out a deep laugh beside him.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, it wasn\u2019t,\u201d he agrees, and then playfully digs his elbow into Draco\u2019s side. Draco yelps, squirming away, and still red in the face from his own imbecilic comment, scowls up at Potter.</p>\n<p>Smiling, Potter reaches up and gingerly brushes away a strand of hair off his face, prompting Draco\u00a0to blink up at him, taken aback.</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you think--?\u201d Potter starts before abruptly pursing his lips and looking away, shoving his hands back into his trouser pockets. Draco waits, annoyed with himself for how badly he wants the man to finish whatever he was about to ask him. When Potter doesn\u2019t speak again, Draco sighs and gives in.</p>\n<p>\u201cDo I think what?\u201d he asks, glancing sideways at him \u2013 damn, the man had a superb side-profile.</p>\n<p>The man had a superb everything.</p>\n<p>\u201cI actually wanted to ask you that very evening--\u201d Potter speaks in a mumble, \u201c--but the probability of you chucking a chair at my head was rather high, so I decided otherwise.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAsk me what?\u201d Draco asks impatiently when the man doesn\u2019t continue.</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you think--?\u201d Potter scratches his ear, restlessly kicking at a stone near his foot. \u201cCould you maybe--?\u201d He looks rather irritated with himself so Draco purses his lips on a smile and waits, tucking his thumbs into his pockets and turning to face the man properly. \u201cMay I have my number? I mean--\u201d He looks rather alarmed as he hurries to correct himself and Draco could feel sudden laughter bubbling up inside him. \u201c--would you give me my number?\u201d He looks downright horrified now and Draco has to inconspicuously bring one hand up to his mouth to hide his grin. \u201cYour number,\u201d Potter sighs resignedly. \u201cMay I have <em>your</em> number?\u201d he finally manages to say, hanging his head and looking miserable.</p>\n<p>Draco bursts out laughing then, although his belly is suddenly filled by a swarm of manic butterflies and his heart thuds excitedly.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat the fuck is <em>wrong</em> with me?\u201d Potter growls irascibly under his breath.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, I don\u2019t know, Potter,\u201d Draco says airily still grinning from ear to ear. \u201cI think I prefer you being an utter wally, stumbling over your words, than being a smug, cocky arsehole.\u201d</p>\n<p>Potter\u2019s face slowly lights up with a wide, toothy smile. \u201cYeah, I\u2019m sure you do,\u201d he murmurs, his eyes shamelessly trailing down Draco\u2019s form once before he takes a step closer to him. \u201cI\u2019d like to take you out to dinner,\u201d he says softly.</p>\n<p>\u201cWould you, now?\u201d Draco asks cheekily, crossing his arms over his chest.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, I would, so tell me when you\u2019re free, or I know of other ways to persuade you.\u201d Potter smoulders at him, making his breath catch. \u201cBetter ways,\u201d Potter adds leaning in, waggling his eyebrows.</p>\n<p>\u201cGod, you\u2019re <em>despicable</em>, I don\u2019t even know why I\u2019m agreeing to this.\u201d Draco bites his lip and quickly drops his gaze, shuffling awkwardly from foot to foot, trying and failing not to instantly think back to that night \u2013 Potter\u2019s tongue, indolently sliding up between his arse cheeks; his thick fingers stuffing him until he could barely breathe, until that massive cock finally took Draco\u2019s breath away entirely.</p>\n<p>\u201cIs that a yes?\u201d Potter\u2019s vivid green eyes are round and charmingly delighted.</p>\n<p>Draco rolls his own steel grey eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s dinner, Potter,\u201d he says blandly. \u201cThere\u2019s no need to get too excited.\u201d</p>\n<p>Potter Sr., peering up at the edifice with one hand shielding his face from the glare of sun, indicates to them at that point, waving them over.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou really should start calling me Harry,\u201d Potter says as they immediately trudge obediently towards the older man. \u201c\u2019Potter\u2019 is way too impersonal a name to call the guy who\u2019s had his tongue up your arse.\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco stumbles over his feet and Harry\u2019s hand immediately closes around his elbow to steady him, a low chuckle drifting out of him.</p>\n<p>\u201cWanker,\u201d Draco hisses.</p>\n<p>\u201cBesides,\u201d Potter goes on, \u201cyou helplessly screaming \u2018Harry\u2019 would be infinitely sexier than you screaming \u2018Potter\u2019 while I fuck you, wouldn\u2019t it?\u201d</p>\n<p>They reach Potter Sr. then who vaguely comments on something about one of the windows on the eighth floor without really looking at the pair of them, and Draco is fervently grateful when Harry, hiding a roguish grin, says something in reply because he definitely can't get his brain to come up with an answer and, fucking hell, now Draco\u2019s cock is stirring, he can\u2019t breathe again because all he can think of is <em>screaming</em> Harry\u2019s name while Harry pins him down and mindlessly <em>fucks</em> him into total incoherency.</p>\n<p>Because hell <em>yes</em>, that would be sexy as <em>fuck</em> and Draco is officially in so much <em>trouble</em>.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\n<strong>~end~</strong>\n</p>"
