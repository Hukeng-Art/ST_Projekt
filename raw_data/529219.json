  "text": "<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<br><em>here is the deepest secret nobody knows<br> (here is the root of the root and the bud of the bud</em>\n<br><em>and the sky of the sky of a tree called life; which grows</em>\n<br><em>higher than soul can hope or mind can hide)</em>\n<br><em>and this is the wonder that's keeping the stars apart</em>\n</p>\n<p><br> It\u2019s something of a tragic commentary on Stiles\u2019 life that he doesn\u2019t even flinch at the sight of a dark figure slouched against his bedroom wall. <em>Secret club house entrance, werewolves only;</em> he was going to have a sign made and hung outside his window, maybe take a Sharpie to it and cross out \u2018<em>were</em>\u2019 for \u2018<em>sour</em>,\u2019 because why the fuck not.<br><br> \u201cReally, I do have a front \u2013 Erica?\u201d<br><br> Stiles freezes, fingers still fumbling against the light switch that had just helped throw the shadowy corner into sharp relief. Erica Reyes, the last werewolf, last <em>person </em>he ever would have expected, is slumped against the window frame, blonde curls tangled and matted and filthy across her face, hanging damp and heavy with <em>oh god that was blood</em>.<br><br> \u201cShit shit shit,\u201d Stiles hisses, throwing himself across the bedroom as fast as his painfully human limbs would let him, careening to a stop just before crashing into her. She barely moves in response, barely does more than gasp at him with a sickeningly wet, squelching sound and a painfully uneven rise and fall of what had to be, at the very least, broken ribs.<br><br> \u201cErica,\u201d he says cautiously, reaching out with the slowest, smoothest motion he could muster in his best effort not to startle her. She flinches away, hunching in on herself, but making no real attempt at shaking off the fingers he\u2019d curled loosely around her wrist. \u201cErica,\u201d he tries again, reaching his other hand up to the hair covering her face. \u201cWhat \u2013 are you\u2026\u201d<br><br> Stiles is a nurturer by nature. He liked to think it was his mother\u2019s influence, a little bit of her leftover in him, someone to do their best to carry on her legacy of being the most unselfishly kind person he\u2019d ever known. One look at the blonde girl\u2019s face as he gingerly pulls her hair back, one glimpse of a bloody bottom lip, of thick mascara and eyeliner running down tearstained cheeks and melting seamlessly into her bruise-battered jaw, and nothing else mattered. Stiles didn\u2019t care how she got to his house, what brought her here, what did this to her. That could come later.<br><br> \u201cI didn\u2019t\u2026\u201d she whispers, gritting out the words between harsh breaths. \u201cI didn\u2019t know\u2026where else to go.\u201d<br><br> \u201cOh my god, come here,\u201d he exhales, using the hand on her wrist to tug Erica off the wall and towards him. She moves without protest, leaning one shoulder into his chest and dropping her forehead against his neck, curling into Stiles in a painfully sad reminder of the old Erica, the human Erica. He ushers her out of his bedroom and towards the bathroom as fast as she\u2019s able to move, lowering her down onto the edge of the bathtub and dropping to his knees between her feet.<br><br> \u201cI\u2019m going to go get you some\u2026(clean, dry, not blood soaked, <em>oh god</em>)\u2026clothes,\u201d he tells her quietly. He keeps his hand cupped around her arm, just above her elbow, not sure which of them, precisely, he was reassuring more with the touch. \u201cAnd then we\u2019re going to get you all cleaned up, okay?\u201d\u00a0<br><br> Erica nods, just a dip of her neck and a soft movement of her chin, enough for Stiles to accept it as acknowledgment but not enough to stop him from hurtling down the hallway like hell was nipping at his heels. There wasn\u2019t much he could do for her, really, and he had no <em>idea</em> why she wasn\u2019t healing on her own, but still, Stiles is reluctant to leave the injured girl alone for longer than absolutely necessary.<br><br> He doesn\u2019t waste time, doesn\u2019t hesitate, but does take just a quick extra second to dig for his fuzziest sweatpants, to tug out a t-shirt that the washing machine had long ago beat into silky-soft submission.<br><br> Hardly even four minutes had passed, if that, but it had apparently been enough for Erica to strip down to bra and underwear, curled protectively in on herself on the closed toilet seat in a way that Stiles knows is down to self-preservation much more than self-consciousness. He staunchly ignores the pile of ripped and bloody cloth next to the tub, crouching down next to Erica\u2019s huddled form and running his free hand down her relatively unscathed bicep again.<br><br> The brunt of the surface damage seems to be her face and neck, knuckles and palms, and one badly shredded knee and shin. Maybe there was something to be said for those leather jackets Derek\u2019s pack seemed to be so fond of. He couldn\u2019t say much for the condition of Erica\u2019s bones, internal organs, and other such vitalities, but there isn\u2019t much he could do even if he knew what was wrong.<br><br> \u201cI need to clean some of these,\u201d Stiles tells Erica, and never in his life has he been more aware of his own inclination to desperately babble. He genuinely can\u2019t tell if the werewolf is listening to a second of it, if his words are falling on deaf ears or not, but he kept his voice low and his tone calm, quietly walking her through a basic survey of her visible injuries and, once that was done, the careful application of hydrogen peroxideand antiseptic. \u201cI don\u2019t know why you\u2019re not healing, but it\u2019s okay, we\u2019ll clean these out and you can shower if you want, we\u2019ll wrap you up and\u2026I don\u2019t know, we\u2019ll call Derek maybe, Derek\u2019ll know \u2013\u201c<br><br> \u201cNo,\u201d Erica gasps, shaking her head in the most vehement motion Stiles had seen since he\u2019d found her. \u201cNo. Not Derek.\u201d<br><br> And that, over everything else that has happened in the last twenty minutes, makes Stiles sits back on his heels and stare up at the trembling sixteen-year-old, fingers stilling from where he\u2019d been gently wiping a betadine-soaked cotton ball across her split knuckles.<br><br> \u201cOkay,\u201d he promises soothingly, dropping the cotton ball and grabbing at Erica\u2019s shaking fingers, wrapping them in his own and squeezing gently. \u201cOkay, Erica it\u2019s okay. I won\u2019t call Derek if you don\u2019t want me to. Okay?\u201d<br><br> He waits until some of the desperation has faded from her battered face, until she\u2019s once again steady enough that she can meet his eye and nod, to resume his work on her knuckles. Erica doesn\u2019t say another word, doesn\u2019t make a sound, even as Stiles moves up to cup her jaw softly with his left hand, right hand probing carefully over the cuts and bruises littering the blonde\u2019s face.<br><br> He finishes in silence, for once finding absolutely nothing to say. Stiles doesn\u2019t know <em>what</em> to say, what to do; it hasn\u2019t even been a week since everything had gone down with the Argents and Jackson, he hasn\u2019t even had a chance to catch his breath yet, but here he is with a healing-impaired werewolf looking steps away from death in his bathroom.<br><br> Stiles can\u2019t say any of this though, can\u2019t press the words out and shove them into Erica\u2019s already rapidly building panic, so he carries on without a sound, quiet and efficient as he cleans the last of the cuts across one sharp cheekbone and drops a bloodstained wash cloth into the sink.<br><br> \u201cOkay,\u201d he breathes slowly, letting the air out of his lungs in stages as he scrambles for a plan. Erica shifts, straightening up just enough for Stiles to realize that her rib cage looks slightly less like it\u2019s been crushed by a mack truck, and he is struck with the desperate need to sort out that dilemma first.<br><br> \u201cOkay,\u201d he says again. \u201cOkay. I mean this in the least offensive, most caring way possible, but you seriously look like you are in need of a nice hot shower.\u201d<br><br> She doesn\u2019t smile, not really, but there\u2019s the barest hint of a quirk to one corner of Erica\u2019s lip, and that\u2019s enough for Stiles. He pushes himself upright carefully, scooping the blonde\u2019s filthy pile of clothing up with him and gesturing with three fingers and the dangling edge of a leather sleeve to the sweatpants and shirt he left on the bathroom sink.<br><br> \u201cI promise those are clean clothes, and there are extra towels under the sink. There\u2019s\u2026I mean, it\u2019s been at least seven years since the last time a girl used this shower, so I apologize in advance for however lacking it might be\u2026\u201d<br><br> Erica shakes her head just slightly, but that little quirk is there again, the little upward tilt of her mouth that <em>isn\u2019t</em> the completely dead, wrecked expression she\u2019s been wearing thus far, so it\u2019s another success for Stiles. He nods decisively before he can start rambling again, elbowing the bathroom door shut behind him and waiting for the telltale sound of water against the ceramic tub before shuffling off to his room.<br><br> He meant to put her clothing in the wash, he really did, but the injuries are nagging at him, needling their way into every train of thought he tries to jump to until he has no choice but to face it. There\u2019s <em>something</em>, he knows it, something significant about the fact that Erica sustained substantial injuries that aren\u2019t healing the way they should, he just can\u2019t think of what. He\u2019s so tempted to text Derek, but he can\u2019t think of a lie to explain why he\u2019d want to know, not one that won\u2019t result in Derek showing up in Stiles\u2019 room in a huffy rage of Alpha, and he can\u2019t do that to Erica.<br><br> He calls Scott. Not that he\u2019s expecting much; Stiles is pretty sure <em>he</em> knows more about being a werewolf than Scott actually does, but sometimes, on rare occasions, Scott picks up on a thing or two. Besides, even if he doesn\u2019t, maybe Stiles can convince Scott to call Deaton at\u20262:00 am.<br><br> Scott, of course, doesn\u2019t answer. Not one of the three phone calls, two texts, fourth phone call, or the voicemail Stiles leaves him. Whatever, Google it is.<br><br> Twenty minutes later, for all it felt like ten seconds, Erica is shuffling her weight from foot to foot in Stiles\u2019 doorway, and the sight of it breaks his damn heart. His clothes, small as they are, still hang on her slight frame, and with her face clean and her blonde hair pulled back, it\u2019s the closest she\u2019s looked to the old Erica in a long time. She looks fragile and broken, the illusion of her newfound invincibility clearly shattered straight through, and Stiles firmly shoves any hesitation he might have felt into the deepest corner of not giving a fuck.<br><br> He pushes himself away from his desk, preliminary (and useless) research into werewolf healing properties forgotten as he drops down onto his bed, patting the empty space next to him in the least presumptuous manner he can. Erica moves with the stilted, cautious gait of someone favoring more than one aching bone, but she does look just a touch better than she did before her shower. She <em>is</em> healing, faster than a human would, but not as fast as <em>she</em> normally would.<br><br> Her movement is careful, but there\u2019s no uncertainty in the way she slowly lowers herself down onto the mattress and immediately curls into Stiles\u2019 side, pressing her face into his shoulder and her knees into his ribs, tucking her feet under his back. Stiles worms an arm under her back, wraps the other over her shoulders, and doesn\u2019t let go as she slowly, unrestrainedly, starts to sob.</p>\n<p><br> To say they wake up would imply that either of them slept. Stiles thinks Erica might\u2019ve dozed off a bit, and maybe there are a couple blank patches in his overall consciousness, but for the most part he\u2019s aware of the gradual arrival of the morning in stages, the slow fade from midnight blue to stormy gray, from pre-dawn light to actual, proper sunlight. Erica\u2019s shoulders stopped shaking around 4:00, the damp spot her tears left on Stiles\u2019 shirt dried up a little after 5:00. He had, at some point during one of his less lucid periods, started absently stroking her hair, and she tracing the lines of his stomach over his shirt. For something that was easily the most intimate thing Stiles had ever done in his life, with someone who was practically, really, a stranger, it was surprisingly, comfortably, platonic.\u00a0<br><br> Stiles is reluctant to break the silence, to disturb the dreamy hush of early morning still hovering in the air, but he\u2019s running out of time before he actually has no choice, and some things are important.<br><br> \u201cI need to start getting ready for school,\u201d he says quietly, tucking a loose blonde curl behind Erica\u2019s ear. \u201cUnless you want me to stay.\u201d<br><br> Erica shakes her head, nose nudging against the side of his ribs with each back and forth slide.<br><br> \u201cNo,\u201d she reiterates quietly, her voice hoarse with disuse and rough with the remnants of her earlier tears. \u201cYou miss enough already because of us.\u201d<br><br> He starts to protest, because <em>really</em>, but Erica cuts him off, soft, but no less assertive than usual.<br><br> \u201cBesides,\u201d she whispers, and there\u2019s a wonderful hint of <em>something</em>, something that says maybe she\u2019s not entirely emotionally destroyed, in her tone. \u201cYou can front all you want, I know you actually like school.\u201d<br><br> Stiles doesn\u2019t know how to protest that. Normally he\u2019d be all over it, lying his ass off up down left and right to cover it up, but it feels\u2026cheap. Like lying to Erica, after last night, would take away something of the sincerity he was trying so hard to present to her, even if it was over something as silly as school.<br><br> \u201cOkay,\u201d he nods, chin bumping against the crown of her head. \u201cMy dad worked the midnight shift last night, but he\u2019s been pulling a lot of doubles since he got back into the office, so you should be okay until I get home.\u201d<br><br> \u201cI can leave\u2026\u201d Erica trails off half-heartedly, voice small and uncertain, and Stiles\u2019 heart breaks for the millionth time that night.<br><br> \u201cNo,\u201d he says firmly. \u201cNo you can\u2019t. In fact, if I get home and you\u2019re anywhere but here I will go on a town-wide manhunt until I find you and drag your sorry ass back home, got it?\u201d<br><br> Erica nods, curling her fingers into the loose t-shirt fabric over Stiles\u2019 stomach. Normally he\u2019d keep a wary eye out for claws, but Erica has been nothing but shockingly human since she\u2019d appeared; scaling the wall outside his window seems to be the last werewolf maneuver she\u2019d managed.<br><br> \u201cGood. Now, Derek,\u201d Stiles begins, and it\u2019s almost painful how Erica tenses up, shoulders stiff, spine rigid under Stiles hand. \u201cHey,\u201d he says quietly, shifting gears. \u201cI promised I wouldn\u2019t talk to him. I\u2019m just warning you, he has a tendency to show up here when I absolutely expect it the least. In fact, I think he does that bit on purpose. He hasn\u2019t\u2026I haven\u2019t heard from him since\u2026well, you shouldn\u2019t have to worry about it. But just keep it in your mind as something that\u2019s not far beyond the realm of possibility, yeah?\u201d<br><br> Erica nods again, and Stiles squeezes her tighter, once, just for a second, before loosening his grip enough that she gets the hint, shifting her weight to allow him to pull his tingling limbs out from the blankets they\u2019d tangled themselves up in. She immediately turns into the pillow he\u2019d been leaning back against, tugging it down to her torso and wrapping her arms around it like a makeshift Stiles. There\u2019s a shockingly overwhelming fondness rising up in the pit of Stiles\u2019 stomach, something brotherly and affectionate and again with the weirdly-intimate-for-near-strangers, but it\u2019s enough for him to lean over, smoothing her hair back out of her face and dropping a kiss to her brow before carefully closing the bedroom door behind him.</p>\n<p><br><br> Stiles barely plants one foot inside the main hall of the high school when he finds himself yanked forward and thrown flat against the nearest bed of lockers, metal handles digging into his lower back while a heavy forearm preses firmly across his trachea.<br><br> \u201cWhat did you do to her?\u201d Isaac snarls, crowding Stiles further back against the lockers and leaning unsettlingly close to the soft skin of the human\u2019s neck.<br><br> \u201cD-dude-\u201d Stiles wheezes, choking the words out from under the werewolf\u2019s vice-like hold across his throat. \u00a0He\u2019d failed to think this all the way through, forgot about those freaking werewolves and their stupid noses, and Stiles is absolutely certain that he <em>reeks</em> of Erica.<br><br> Isaac begrudgingly lifts the pressure on the other boy\u2019s throat, just enough that Stiles coughs in his face a few times before making a more successful attempt at speaking.<br><br> \u201cShe\u2019s fine,\u201d he says quickly, going against everything Derek told them and staring the werewolf dead in the eyes, meeting Isaac\u2019s gaze unflinchingly. \u201cErica\u2026I don\u2019t really know what happened. She\u2019s hurt, and she\u2019s not healing right. But she\u2019s going to be okay, Isaac, she is. And she\u2019s safe.\u201d<br><br> \u201c<em>Where</em>?\u201d Isaac whines, and Stiles is shocked at the sheer desperation in the single word. He\u2019s never thought of Derek\u2019s pack as being <em>close</em>, together out of necessity more than an actual bond, but Isaac is pinning him with such a distressed look, such wretched concern on his face, that Stiles is forced to reevaluate.<br><br> \u201cMy house,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cBut, Isaac\u2026\u201d<br><br> Isaac moves faster than Stiles could ever have guessed, out the door and halfway to the sidewalk before Stiles even reaches the second syllable of his name. Stiles isn\u2019t sure he\u2019d have been able to catch Isaac even if he had werewolf speed on his side, no doubt in his mind that Isaac would be at the Stilinski\u2019s house before he\u2019d even made it to his first period class.<br><br><em>p. sure isaacs bout 2 brk in</em><br><br> He texts Erica, hoping desperately that it won\u2019t make things worse, that she won\u2019t react to Isaac the same way she had to the mention of Derek. From what Stiles understood about packs, and from the lost desperation on Isaac\u2019s face before he left, Stiles can\u2019t imagine Isaac\u2019s presence being anything but <em>good </em>for Erica, but still. He feels oddly, overwhelming protective, and can\u2019t help but hover over his phone for the entire walk to class, waiting for a response.<br><br><em>its ok.</em><br><br> He gets finally, seconds before the first period bell was due to ring.<br><br><em>needed him. ty. </em><br><br> Satisfied that that was the best he was going to get, at least until he got back home and could evaluate the situation for himself, Stiles shoves his phone back into his pocket and settles in for what is undoubtedly going to be the longest school day of his entire year.</p>\n<p><br><br> As promised, it\u2019s approximately the longest day of Stiles\u2019 existence, and he\u2019s had some truly, <em>painfully </em>snail-paced days in his time.<br><br> Scott tries to talk to him once or twice, he thinks. Makes something of a half-hearted explanation for missing Stiles\u2019 admittedly excessive attempts at contacting him last night (though still doesn\u2019t express enough interest in the issue to ask <em>why</em> Stiles wants to know). Stiles responds in the easiest way he knows how these days; devoting less than a quarter of his attention to filtering through the long-winded musings about Life After Allison while idly weighing how long it\u2019s going to take Scott to notice what Isaac had realized in under a minute.<br><br> (The entire day goes by without so much as a puzzled sniff \u2013 Stiles would have lost any bets he placed, and therefore vows never to mention it out loud.)<br><br> He makes a flimsy excuse to not hang out with Scott after classes, practically running to his car the second the last bell rings. Stiles takes the stairs two at a time when he gets home, not even bothering to hide his anxiety. He <em>hates</em> leaving people alone when they\u2019re sick, when they\u2019re hurting. He\u2019s always hated the thought of someone suffering in silence, of suffering alone and immobile and without anything to provide any kind of distraction from the inevitable and overwhelming cascade of thought. He lets out a breath he didn\u2019t know he was holding, a sigh of relief he hadn\u2019t realized he needed, when he throws open his bedroom door to find Isaac huddled next to Erica, wrapped in an undoubtedly protective position around her sleeping form.<br><br> Protective, Stiles realizes, but not defensive. Isaac must have known it was him, recognized his scent or his heartbeat or his footsteps or whatever the hell it was with their damn spidey-senses, because he doesn\u2019t even blink at Stiles\u2019 sudden appearance in the room, just frowns petulantly and made a frantic shushing motion with his free hand.<br><br> It winds up being a wasted effort. Erica cracks both eyes open seconds after Stiles quietly closes the door behind him, and the soft upward curl of one corner of her lip sends another wave of fondness through Stiles. She almost seems to be just as relieved that Stiles is back, lifting one hand off Isaac\u2019s hip to beckon Stiles towards the bed, both werewolves shifting over to make room for him to slip into the space on Erica\u2019s other side.<br><br> \u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d he asks quietly, wedging one shoulder under Erica\u2019s until she\u2019s propped up between the two boys, Isaac\u2019s elbow against Stiles\u2019 collarbone, Erica leaning back in the space between them. She hooks one ankle over Stiles\u2019 leg, tucking her bare foot under his calf, and he drops a hand down to curl over her hip without even stopping to think about it.<br><br> \u201cBetter,\u201d she shrugs, \u201ca bit.\u201d<br><br> Stiles nods. He doesn\u2019t want to push her, he really doesn\u2019t, but he\u2019d spent the entire day distracting himself by coming up with a long list of questions and concerns and things that he really has the burning need to start researching <em>immediately</em>, and the most pressing of which, he\u2019s quickly starting to prioritize, was why the fuck he\u2019s so shamelessly comfortable with two werewolves he wasn\u2019t even friends with all up in his bed <em>cuddling</em> with him.<br><br> \u201cSo. Not that this isn\u2019t nice,\u201d he starts bluntly, gesturing to the general <em>this</em> covering his mattress. \u201cAnd not that I\u2019d ever complain about having two frankly gorgeous people in my bed on a normal basis, but, like\u2026\u201d<br><br> \u201cIt\u2019s a wolf thing,\u201d Isaac says carefully. He\u2019s watching Erica, like he\u2019s not quite sure what he is and is not allowed to reveal to Stiles, but she doesn\u2019t seem even remotely perturbed by the question.<br><br> \u201cI told you,\u201d she takes over when Isaac starts to look like he isn\u2019t going to elaborate any time soon. \u201cI didn\u2019t know where else to go. I couldn\u2019t go back to Derek, not when I was that weak, not after defecting like that. And Isaac\u2026\u201d<br><br> \u201cI live with Derek,\u201d the other teen supplies, shrugging his free shoulder. Stiles frowns at that, because last time he checked Derek split his time between a burnt out shell of a house and a dilapidated train depot, both of which are definitely unsuitable life choices for one person, let alone two.<br><br> \u201cRight,\u201d Erica nods. \u201cAnd I can\u2019t\u2026I can\u2019t go home right now.\u201d<br><br> \u201cDon\u2019t tell me you were living with Derek too.\u201d Stiles frowns harder. That absolutely is just not acceptable; he\u2019s overwhelmingly not okay with that.<br><br> The blonde drums her fingers against Stiles\u2019 thigh lightly, nails against the rough grain of his jeans. \u201cSometimes,\u201d she admits. \u201cI stayed with Boyd, sometimes, since his dad hadn\u2019t really, I mean\u2026\u201d<br><br> \u201cWait - where is Boyd?\u201d The second the words are out of Stiles\u2019 mouth, he knows. He knows without even needing to see the look on Isaac\u2019s face, hearing the slow, ragged intake of breath from Erica.<br><br> \u201cBoyd\u2026Boyd is\u2026\u201d<br><br> \u201cNever mind,\u201d Stiles says quickly, squeezing Erica\u2019s sharply protruding hipbone lightly. \u201cLater. One thing at a time.\u201d<br><br> The blonde inhales a long, shaky breath before nodding, setting her shoulders a little more firmly against the two boys\u2019 before taking another, shorter breath.<br><br> \u201cI didn\u2019t know where to go,\u201d she repeats, \u201cso I just kind of\u2026I let the wolf instinct in a little more than normal. To see if it could sniff out somewhere safe, somewhere to hide. And, well, I wound up here.\u201d<br><br> \u201cWhy?\u201d Stiles asks, entirely out of curiosity over protest. It\u2019s\u2026frankly, it\u2019s oddly flattering, and leaves a warm sort of something settling in his ribcage. Stiles can\u2019t remember the last time he felt like someone actually needed him, like he had something to offer that no one else could give. It wasn\u2019t like Derek, begrudgingly accepting Stiles\u2019 help when he had no other options, or his dad, humoring Stiles\u2019 compulsive efforts to try and keep him healthy and safe.<br><br> \u201cYou look out for us,\u201d Erica admits. \u201cYou do it without even thinking about it. Even though you\u2019re just\u2026you\u2019re not\u2026like that day in the library. Scott was so busy worrying about his stupid girlfriend, but you stayed with me. <em>You</em> made sure I got to Derek, <em>you</em> took care of me.\u201d<br><br> \u201cIt\u2019s a wolf thing,\u201d Isaac says again. \u201cYou earned the respect of the wolves by acting like part of the pack, and even more so by doing it as a human.\u201d<br><br> \u201cWell that\u2019s,\u201d <em>strangely sweet</em>, \u201cactually kind of awesome, which makes sense because I am awesome, but it still doesn\u2019t explain why <em>I\u2019m</em> okay with this,\u201d he gestures again to Erica\u2019s leg thrown over his own, nudging his head backward into the arm Isaac had snuck around his neck, \u201csnuggly little puppy pile. I didn\u2019t even realize it was weird until I started thinking about it.\u201d<br><br> \u201cInstinct,\u201d Erica shrugs.<br><br> \u201cYou\u2019re not a wolf,\u201d Isaac agrees, cutting Stiles off before he manages to point out the obvious, \u201cbut you\u2019re a human that runs with a wolf pack. It rubs off on you, whether you realize it or not.\u201d<br><br> \u201cYou may not be a werewolf,\u201d Erica teases, the most light-hearted tone Stiles\u2019s heard from her yet, \u201cbut we\u2019ve rubbed off on you a little bit.\u201d<br><br> And weirdly enough, Stiles thinks that\u2019s actually really cool. Wolf instincts. Word. Besides, he\u2019d only been slightly kidding earlier \u2013 you don\u2019t get much hotter than Erica Reyes and Isaac Lahey, and Stiles really, <em>really </em>is not going to complain about having either one of them all up in his cuddle grill.</p>\n<p><br> They spend the rest of the afternoon answering Stiles\u2019 multitude of questions to the best of their abilities. Isaac, once he\u2019d gotten over his initial power-rage hard-on after the turn, had spent the better part of the last two weeks grilling Dr. Deaton for as much information as the good veterinarian was willing to share. Stiles has to admit, he\u2019s impressed by the tenacity \u2013 and deeply regretful of the fact that he hadn\u2019t taken the time to think of it first. He\u2019s also, quietly, to himself, pleasantly surprised by how <em>effortless</em> it is. Some collective, unacknowledged decision has been made, or maybe they\u2019ve all just had their worlds knocked so far off axis that everyone\u2019s just defaulting to tabula rasa, but whatever animosity, whatever antagonistic drive previously existed between them is just <em>gone</em>. Isaac is painfully easy to like when he\u2019s not acting like a raging rage monster, and Erica \u2013 Stiles is genuinely disappointed in himself for not realizing sooner how incredibly awesome Erica is, how great she could have been for him.<br><br> Once everyone\u2019s warm and loose and comfortable, Stiles and Isaac convince Erica to tell them what happened. It\u2019s stilted and painful, painstakingly pulling shrapnel from a ravaged wound, but they eventually gather enough information to draw a decent picture. Erica and Boyd, having escaped from Gerard and abandoned (and <em>oh</em> how Erica flinches over the word, remorse dripping from every syllable) the pack, barely made it to the edge of the woods before meeting another pack of wolves. An <em>alpha pack</em>, specifically, who\u2019d taken one good look at the pathetic, month old betas in their trap and promptly gone to town on them. Erica managed to escape them only because Boyd, good, fiercely protective Boyd, had thrown himself head-first into the pack, distracting them long enough for her to get away. She has no idea how she made it as far as Stiles\u2019 house, or where in the woods she\u2019d started from, but at the very least it explained why her injuries weren\u2019t healing the way they normally would.<br><br> \u201cI hate to be the bearer of bad tidings,\u201d Stiles sighs, scrubbing one hand over his hair before dragging his palm slowly down his face, \u201cbut someone needs to tell Derek.\u201d<br><br> Erica and Isaac both shift uncomfortably, neither one even pretending to look anywhere near Stiles\u2019 face. He knows what\u2019s coming, knew before he opened his mouth, really.<br><br> \u201cYeah,\u201d Isaac agrees. \u201cBut we were kind of hoping it\u2019d be you.\u201d<br><br> \u201cHow\u2019d I know?\u201d the brunet grumbles back. \u201cI get why not Erica, but what about you?\u201d<br><br> \u201cHe\u2019s mad at me,\u201d the other boy says glumly, picking at a loose thread fraying off the hem of Erica\u2019s shirt. \u201cHe thinks I stayed for Scott and not for him, and that I\u2019m trying to break away from his pack and be a part of Scott\u2019s instead.\u201d<br><br> Stiles rolls his eyes. Personally, he thinks the last thing any of them needs is Scott as the Alpha of his own pack. Good lord, he loves the kid like his own brother, but Scott as an Alpha?<br><br> \u201cAre you?\u201d he asks warily.<br><br> \u201cI \u2013 no,\u201d Isaac says unconvincingly. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be in Scott\u2019s pack. I want Scott to be in ours.\u201d<br><br> Stiles frowns again, nodding in response to the werewolf\u2019s unspoken question.<br><br> \u201cFine,\u201d he nods, just once more for good measure. \u201cI\u2019ll tell Derek. I\u2019ll go now, actually, cause he really needs to know what\u2019s going on. But when I get back, you two have to do me a favor.\u201d<br><br> Erica is nodding before he\u2019s even done, before he\u2019s even finished asking, and the unquestioning loyalty again struck Stiles in a weird place, somewhere deep in his ribs and suspiciously close to his heart.<br><br> \u201cWhen I get back,\u201d Stiles sighs, extricating himself from the tangle of limbs on the bed and stretching slowly to his feet. \u201cYou guys have to help me come up with a decent cover story to explain to my dad why you\u2019ve apparently moved in for the week.\u201d</p>\n<p><br> The train depot \u2013 and even in his <em>head</em> Stiles can\u2019t muster up the proper level of disdain to express how vehemently opposed he is to this shit \u2013 is looking particularly worse for the wear when Stiles shoves his way through the back door. Honestly, it looks like a grenade just let loose in here, and for one, semi-panicky second Stiles actually considers the possibility (because really, this is his life and therefore it is a <em>thing</em> that actually <em>could </em>happen) that it actually did.<br><br> \u201cDerek?\u201d he calls, not bothering to raise his voice higher than standard indoor volume. There\u2019s no response, not so much as the creak of rusted metal or the shuffle of rubber soles against concrete, but Stiles knows, <em>instinctively </em>(because HA, werewolf instincts), that Derek is here.<br><br> \u201cDerek, come on,\u201d he tries again, picking his way over the debris littering the floor, making his way towards the crumbling remains of the rail car he knew Derek had claimed as his own. \u201cI\u2019m not leaving without searching this entire place top to bottom, which will realistically take me longer than this conversation will, so the sooner you acknowledge me the sooner you can get rid of me.\u201d<br><br> The responding sharp crash of glass shattering against metal is near immediate. The brunet barely flinches at it, heaving the long-suffering sigh of one entirely too used to overly dramatic diva werewolves and climbing the rest of the way towards the train car.<br><br> Derek is slouched on the floor between two rows of seats, wedged into the miniscule leg space with one arm resting heavily on the half-torn-away bench and his booted feet in the ruined aisle. He doesn\u2019t even bother looking at Stiles, just helps himself to a hearty swig of the nearly-empty bottle of Jack Daniels dangling from his fingertips. Stiles squints along the floor, considering the crash, and sure enough he can see the remains of what looked suspiciously like a second bottle shattered by his feet, and holy shit, if Stiles didn\u2019t know better he\u2019d say there\u2019s actually a distinct possibility that Derek Hale is <em>drunk</em>.<br><br> \u201cGet out.\u201d<br><br> Stiles thought he knew Derek\u2019s deadpan droll. Thought he knew how the Alpha could flatten his tone to nearly nothing, monotonous disinterest oozing through every word out of that whip-sharp mouth. Past experience has <em>nothing </em>on this, on the utter emptiness in Derek\u2019s voice, words spoken entirely without affect.<br><br> \u201cDude,\u201d he breathes, crossing the space between them until there\u2019s just single seat back separating him from the older man. \u201cYou look <em>wrecked</em>.\u201d<br><br> \u201cFuck off and die,\u201d the werewolf responds succinctly.<br><br> Any other day Stiles would have been impressed by his unflinching delivery, really, but this is just\u2026this is <em>sad</em>. Pathetic sad, clearly, but also just downright <em>sad</em>. Stiles almost wants to get right up into Derek\u2019s personal space, to wrap himself around the Alpha, crowd up into him until he could <em>feel</em> the tension melting away. He wonders, not for the first time, how long it\u2019s been since Derek just let somebody <em>hold him</em>.<br><br> \u201cDerek,\u201d he tuts, sidling around the last bench of seats until he\u2019s standing in the space between Derek\u2019s slightly spread calves. \u201cSeriously, I\u2019ve seen better-looking corpses \u2013\u201d<br><br> For the second time today Stiles finds himself slamming backwards into painfully harsh metal without seeing it coming (and really, he should have), hard and heavy muscle held taut against him, pinning him flat like a frog on a dissection tray. Derek breathes harsh, damp heat against Stiles\u2019 face, weighed down with the stench of whiskey and whatever else had died in the other man\u2019s mouth recently, both hands fisted in the loose fabric of Stiles\u2019 t-shirt.<br><br> \u201cWhat part of get out,\u201d he snarls, face so close Stiles can feel the push and pull of each word in the air, \u201cdid you not fucking understand, Stiles?\u201d<br><br> Stiles, in a move that truly, honestly shocks even himself in that moment, keeps his mouth shut. He\u2019s never had much patience for rhetorical questions, generally took great pleasure in pissing people off by offering answers he knew they weren\u2019t really looking for, but apparently self-preservation is kicking in strong today. He keeps his lips carefully, pointedly sealed, tilting his chin down and slightly to the side, lowering his gaze to study the seats behind Derek\u2019s right elbow.<br><br> Nobody moves for several long, incredibly drawn out breaths. Stiles waits in quiet supplication, studiously keeping his eyes lowered and his neck subtly bared, focusing his otherwise racing thoughts on the task of slowing his heart rate back down to a reasonably steady beat, his breathing to something less intense than a hundred meter sprinter\u2019s. On the fifth slow, deliberate inhale, Derek loosens his grip just a bit.<br><br> Stiles waits until the tenth exhale, each breath relaxing the werewolf\u2019s hold on him just a little more, before he\u2019s willing to raise his eyes back up to meet Derek\u2019s. He finds, rather than the angry red glare he\u2019d been expecting, the top of Derek\u2019s (shocking disheveled) head. The Alpha\u2019s forehead is pressed against the hand still clutching Stiles\u2019 collar, the other hand sliding up to curl around the younger teen\u2019s neck.<br><br> \u201cDerek,\u201d Stiles mutters. He moves without thinking about it, reaching one hand forward to grip the werewolf\u2019s hip, mirroring the hold on his neck.<br><br> \u201cYou smell like them,\u201d Derek mumbles. He\u2019s flattened his hand against Stiles\u2019 chest, bringing his face even closer to the fabric Stiles was now positive stank of Derek\u2019s pack. \u201cIsaac, Erica.\u201d<br><br> \u201cThat,\u201d Stiles supplies helpfully, \u201cmay be in some way related to the cuddle orgy that has been taking place on my bed since last night.\u201d<br><br> Derek whimpers. <em>Whimpers</em>, like Stiles has actually just inflicted some kind of physical pain on him, and the brunet absolutely <em>does not get it</em>. He\u2019s missed something massive, clearly, somewhere between waking up in the Argent\u2019s basement and Erica climbing in his window last night, and he\u2019s starting to think he\u2019s actually going to have to figure out what it is before he makes any progress here.<br><br> \u201cThey\u2019re okay,\u201d Stiles tells him, politely ignoring the way Derek is now shamelessly inhaling the scent off his clothing. \u201cErica and Isaac. They\u2019re safe.\u201d<br><br> \u201cBoyd?\u201d<br><br> Stiles exhales slowly, dragging it out as long as possible. \u201cBoyd\u2019s\u2026Boyd\u2019s dead, Derek.\u201d<br><br> He didn\u2019t realized to how much of Derek\u2019s weight had been resting on his chest until the werewolf starts dropping heavily to the ground, legs seemingly giving out beneath him. Stiles makes a desperate attempt at catching him, hands coming up to grab under Derek\u2019s arms, but he does little more than slow their fall, the pair of them collapsing in a heap on the filthy train floor.<br><br> Derek\u2019s forehead dislodges itself from Stiles\u2019 chest, landing somewhere in the crook between his neck and collarbone, pressed against the tips of the fingers still wrapped around the younger teen\u2019s neck. Stiles fists his hands in the shirt over Derek\u2019s ribs, pulling the werewolf closer without bothering to consider the potentially fatal ramifications. Derek, for the first time Stiles can remember, doesn\u2019t protest the touch, just kept breathing staccato, desperate breaths into the hollow of Stiles\u2019 throat.<br><br> \u201cOh fuck,\u201d Stiles exhales, shifting his weight to settle more comfortably on the floor, bending one knee against Derek\u2019s back to help support them both. He gives in to the impulse \u2013 pack instinct or basic human conscience, he doesn\u2019t know or care \u2013 and shifts his grip on Derek\u2019s shirt until Stiles can manhandle him between the v of his thighs, back flush against Stiles\u2019 chest, one of Stiles\u2019 arms firm across his chest and one wrapped around his stomach.<br><br> Derek doesn\u2019t struggle, doesn\u2019t protest, sinks into the embrace (for all its aggression there\u2019s really no other word for it) with nothing more than a shudder. This, more than anything, slaps Stiles flat across the face as a giant red flag of Wrong Very Wrong, because Derek is never <em>compliant</em>, compliant and Derek shouldn\u2019t even co-exist in the same <em>room</em>, let alone the same sentence. There are werewolves in his bed and they were drawn there on some pro-Stiles <em>instinct </em>and Derek is falling apart and also possibly drunk and is nothing <em>sacred </em>in this world anymore?<br><br> Stiles makes up for it the best way he can \u2013 he talks. And talks. And talks.<br><br> \u201cThey were attacked by an alpha pack,\u201d he whispers, angling his head closer to the older man\u2019s ear and shifting his grip a little higher up on Derek\u2019s shoulder. \u201cBoyd fought back so Erica could escape. She came to my house for some wolf-y instinct reason I\u2019m still not clear on. I\u2019m not gonna lie, she got the shit beat out of her by those Alphas, and of course it\u2019s all healing at a lot closer to human-speed than you all normally do, but she\u2019s okay. She\u2019s okay, and Isaac\u2019s with her too, and they miss you. They\u2019re scared to come home, come here, but they want to. Which, of course, makes me question their better judgment because <em>seriously</em>, Derek, this place is just a catastrophe waiting to happen, can\u2019t we just find you a nice apartment somewhere, clean out someone\u2019s basement, maybe even at least just buy you a <em>mattress</em>, I mean <em>really, </em>and speaking of living things are we ever going to talk about Mr. Back From the Dead and whether or not he\u2019s secretly planning to kill us all and overthrow you as alpha or \u2013 \u201d<br><br> \u201cHe left.\u201d<br><br> The words are so quiet, muffled as they are in the sleeve of Stiles\u2019 hoody, that he wouldn\u2019t even have noticed them if he hadn\u2019t felt the motion of Derek\u2019s jaw against his arm.<br><br> \u201cAre we adding this to the column of good things or bad things that have happened this week?\u201d<br><br> Derek shifts his head slightly, lifting his chin so the entire lower half of his face isn\u2019t burrowed in Stiles\u2019 sleeve anymore, and Stiles can feel the dirt and grime from Derek\u2019s hair against his cheekbone.<br><br> \u201cHe said he was going to find some local packs we used to be on good terms with. See if he could find out anything about the alpha pack\u2026\u201d<br><br> \u201cBut\u2026\u201d Stiles prods.<br><br> Derek is quiet for a long minute, and in a rare display of impulse control Stiles lets the silence sit. He thinks maybe it\u2019s because he\u2019s so far out of his element, so completely at a loss as to how he wound up here, curled up against the wall of an out-of-use train car with <em>Derek fucking Hale</em> practically in his lap, that even his fallback of babbling endlessly has completely packed its bags and abandoned him.<br><br> \u201cI was never supposed to be Alpha,\u201d Derek admits, so soft it\u2019s barely loud enough for Stiles to hear it. \u201cMy mom was Alpha, and would have been for a long time under better circumstances. Even if she wasn\u2019t, I had an older brother. And Laura. And two or three cousins probably better suited to it than I ever would have been. He killed my sister. He killed Laura, and he killed too many other people, and he turned the single most infuriating kid on the planet into the single most infuriating <em>werewolf</em> on the planet, and he made general chaos out of what was already a pretty miserable existence.\u201d<br><br> \u201cBut\u2026\u201d Stiles, he figures, can fill in the blank himself this time. \u201cHe\u2019s the only family you have left.\u201d<br><br> Derek lets his silence confirm what Stiles already knew.<br><br> It sits longer this time, hanging heavily in the air between them, around them. Long enough for Stiles mind to wander, again, in the direction of <em>what the unholy fuck is he </em>doing<em> here</em>. This is definitely above and beyond whatever instincts Erica and Isaac seem to think he has. This is <em>Derek</em>. He\u2019s borderline cuddling <em>Derek Hale</em>, best known for his fondness for shoving Stiles bodily into as many immovable objects as he can, with a fuse shorter than a dog collar and a serious need for a muzzle. Never mind how often Stiles may have thought all Derek needs is a nice hug, or the very rare occasions he\u2019s actually been tempted to offer one\u2026this is legitimately insane, no matter how fucked up they both are.<br><br> \u201cAre you drunk?\u201d he finally asks, mostly to distract himself and maybe hoping that Derek will react violently to the blatant disregard for his apparent meltdown, because at least then there would be some semblance of <em>normalcy</em>.<br><br> Typically, because it\u2019s exactly what he doesn\u2019t want, Stiles gets a <em>smirk</em> in response.<br><br> \u201cHalf an hour before you got here,\u201d Derek mumbles, waving one hand carelessly towards the mostly-empty bottle of whiskey left abandoned on the other side of the train car, \u201cthere were two of those. Full.\u201d<br><br> \u201cAh.\u201d Because really, what do you even say to that? Apparently werewolves can get drunk, they just have to soak their liver eight ways to alcoholism first? \u201cOkay, up.\u201d<br><br> He loosens his grip on Derek\u2019s shoulder, lowers the leg still bracing the right side of Derek\u2019s body. The older man moves slowly, almost reluctantly, leaning forward to break Stiles\u2019 hold and give him enough room to move, but not bothering to stand up himself. He leans back into the space Stiles leaves behind almost as soon as the teen\u2019s out of the way, slumping against the train wall.<br><br> \u201cRight,\u201d Stiles nods, falling back on a business-like efficiency he didn\u2019t know he possessed. \u201cThis alpha pack, any immediate threat from them? Immediate like within the next week?\u201d<br><br> Derek shrugs, but Stiles knows by now that if there was a real threat, if there was a real need for urgency, they wouldn\u2019t even be here right now. He\u2019s not overly concerned, not entirely, but it\u2019s worth checking anyway.<br><br> \u201cGood,\u201d he nods again, \u201cgood. So listen\u2026\u201d he trails off, because Derek is still not really looking at him, and this is actually semi-important.<br><br> \u201cDerek Hale,\u201d he hisses, crouching down low to get in Derek\u2019s face, and it\u2019s actually amazing the way Derek\u2019s hazel eyes snap up towards him, \u201cfor once in your goddamn life will you <em>fucking listen to me</em>. Thank you. Jesus.\u201d Stiles glares, channeling as much of the angerfrustrationdislike that he usually feels from Derek\u2019s own bone-chilling hate-stares, until he\u2019s certain he\u2019s got the werewolf\u2019s attention.<br><br> \u201cNow,\u201d he says slowly, \u201chere\u2019s what we\u2019re going to do. You have a week, Derek. One week. Take a break, go find the Jack Daniels distillery and drink your way through it, kill some deer, get another tattoo. Whatever. Fucked if I care. Clear your head, figure your shit out. I\u2019m giving you a week, man, to pull yourself together.\u201d<br><br> Derek opens his mouth, and whether it\u2019s to argue or to agree Stiles doesn\u2019t particularly care.<br><br> \u201cNo!\u201d he snaps, pointing one finger accusingly at the interruption. \u201cNope. This is not a friendly suggestion, and it\u2019s not open for discussion. Get your shit together, find someplace to house your pack \u2013 <em>yes your pack, don\u2019t give me that look </em>\u2013 someplace that isn\u2019t this absolute shithole. Make peace with the fact that you\u2019re the Alpha now, whether you want it or not, because we need you, and we need you not to be an absolute asshole about it. Is that clear?\u201d<br><br> Derek stares at him. <em>Stares</em>, like he\u2019s never quite seen anything like Stiles before, and Stiles can\u2019t really blame him. He lowers his hand back down to his side but pointedly refuses to look away, narrowing his eyes just enough to reiterate that he means <em>business</em>.<br><br> \u201cYeah. Yes.\u201d Derek nods, confirming in triplicate.<br><br> \u201cGreat,\u201d Stiles straightens up, wipes his sweaty palms on his jeans like he\u2019s just brushing off the filth, and storms out of the train depot without another word.<br><br> He waits until he\u2019s a solid two miles away to slam on the brakes, pull the Jeep over, and shake his way through the biggest <em>holy shit</em> of a panic attack he\u2019s suffered in a long, long time.</p>\n<p><br> Stiles drives Isaac to school in the morning, and it\u2019s an oddly pleasant feeling, sharing that drowsy, half-awake asscrack-of-dawn stumble with someone else. Isaac makes him coffee and Stiles doesn\u2019t burn their toast, and it\u2019s just that little bit easier to shuffle off towards first period when you\u2019re solid in the camaraderie of shared suffering. Stiles mulls this over as he nurses what\u2019s left of his second, to-go cup of coffee he\u2019d insisted they stop for, and the distraction leads him to promptly walk head-first into Scott.<br><br> \u201cYou smell like Isaac,\u201d Scott says suspiciously, glaring at the lukewarm coffee like it\u2019s had anything to say in that matter.<br><br> Stiles rolls his eyes, because honestly, Scott, really?<br><br> \u201cThat would make sense,\u201d he agrees, \u201csince I drove him to school this morning. And he slept at my house last night. And also this might possibly be his shirt, I got dressed in the dark this morning.\u201d He stops himself at the last second so he doesn\u2019t add \u2018because I didn\u2019t want to wake Erica up by turning the lights on.\u2019 Scott\u2019s head looks reasonably blown enough as is; one thing at a time, really.<br><br> \u201cYou \u2013 I \u2013\u201d Scott frowns expressively \u2013 really, his whole <em>face</em> frowns, possibly his entire body \u2013 and Stiles feels a stab of guilt. It\u2019s not like Scott\u2019s been smooth sailing lately either, Stiles can forgive the occasional bit of distraction. Plus, he hasn\u2019t spent an overabundant amount of time with Erica; he might not recognize her scent as easily as he would Stiles\u2019 or Isaac\u2019s, or even Derek\u2019s.<br><br> The bell rings, interrupting any effort Stiles would have made at explaining, and this time they\u2019re both glaring at relatively blameless inanimate objects.<br><br> \u201cOkay,\u201d Stiles says quickly, because he really, really cannot afford to be late and neither can Scott. \u201cI have approximately a million things of supreme importance to tell you as soon as possible. After school pow-wow? Say yes.\u201d<br><br> \u201cYeah,\u201d Scott nods, clapping Stiles\u2019 shoulder in further affirmation. \u201cSee you at lunch.\u201d<br><br> The morning passes at a leisurely pace, and Stiles spends an entire period pondering what, precisely, it says about his current life that <em>school</em> is his pleasant, relaxing downtime between the overwhelming chaos of the outside world. <em>Relaxing</em>. School is<em> relaxing</em>. He has a lurking suspicion that werewolves are to blame for this. All of them. As an entire, all-encompassing species.<br><br> Lunch rolls around and Scott is already waiting for him at their usual table. It takes approximately eight seconds and one look at Scott\u2019s expression for Stiles to realize what\u2019s coming.<br><br> \u201cSo listen,\u201d Scott says quickly, cutting Stiles off before he can even open his mouth. \u201cI know I said I\u2019d meet up with you after school, but I was just talking to Allison, and she and I are like, trying to do the whole friends thing, you know? Because, I mean, she could really use some friends right now, and friends is better than nothing, isn\u2019t it? So she suggested maybe we could hang out today, said she\u2019d help me study for that Chem test on Thursday so maybe I don\u2019t completely blow my entire grade and can we maybe reschedule?\u201d<br><br> He says it all in several long, gasping exhales of breath, like he knows the second he gives Stiles an in, Stiles will run a mile away with it. It\u2019s a testament to how well he knows Stiles, really, because Stiles is just <em>waiting</em> for an opportunity to rip Scott\u2019s small intestines out through his mouth. Or possibly punch him in the face. He\u2019ll settle for a nice long ranting scream, really.<br><br> \u201cSeriously? Friends? That is a disaster waiting to happen and you know it, Scotty.\u201d<br><br> Isaac drops down into the empty chair on Stiles\u2019 right, flashing an easy grin at Scott that lessens the offense. Scott looks confused, frowning at the way Stiles doesn\u2019t react to Isaac\u2019s surprise appearance.<br><br> \u201cBut you\u2019re right about one thing,\u201d Isaac continues, reaching forward to sneak a fry off Scott\u2019s tray, \u201cthat Chem grade of yours is so way far down the drain it hurts. How about English, how are you there?\u201d<br><br> \u201cYou\u2019d think,\u201d Scott sighs, rolling with the unexpected in an unusually non-Scott-like manner, \u201cconsidering I\u2019ve been speaking it my entire life, I might actually be passing it. I think I might be doing better in Spanish than I am in English.\u201d<br><br> \u201cWell,\u201d Isaac grins again, offering up a pretzel in exchange for the french fry he\u2019d pilfered, \u201cthat\u2019s why you\u2019ve got me around. How are you doing on that Mockingbird essay? Have you had your one-on-one with Williams yet?\u201d<br><br> The horrorstruck expression on Scott\u2019s face tells Stiles that, a. he completely forgot about said meeting and, b. it was some time today.<br><br> \u201cShit shit shit,\u201d Scott hisses, shoving his tray over in Isaac\u2019s direction, grabbing half a chicken strip for himself as he jumped up out of his chair. \u201cI was supposed to be in the library five minutes ago. Shit.\u201d<br><br> He\u2019s gone before either Stiles or Isaac can stop him. <em><br><br></em>\u201cHas he always been like that,\u201d Isaac comments offhand, waving another one of Scott\u2019s fries at his rapidly retreating form, \u201cor is this a recent, wolf-and-Allison-inspired decent into insanity?\u201d<br><br> \u201cIsaac,\u201d Stiles sighs, helping himself to one of Scott\u2019s abandoned chicken fingers, \u201cthere was a solid two weeks in eighth grade that I read the entire DSM-IV in hopes of finding some kind of psychological disorder to properly explain that which is Scott McCall.\u201d<br><br> Isaac\u2019s response is interrupted by yet another arrival \u2013 and this one, unlike Isaac, deserves a sharp double-take and slight gaping from Stiles, because Jackson fucking Whittemore has just settled himself into Scott\u2019s recently vacated seat. He doesn\u2019t come bearing food, doesn\u2019t even put his backpack down; he looks like a man on a mission.<br><br> And suddenly it all comes roaring back, and Stiles valiantly resists the urge to slam his head repeatedly against the cheap tabletop. How, <em>how</em> had he forgotten, how had they <em>all </em>forgotten, judging by the look on Isaac\u2019s face, about Jackson? Holy shit, there\u2019s a brand spanking new werewolf sitting in front of them like he\u2019s not quite sure he\u2019s allowed to be here, and it\u2019s such a bizarre change from the Jackson Stiles is so used to that he doesn\u2019t know how to recover.<br><br> \u201cSo,\u201d Jackson clears his throat. He\u2019s got one hand nonchalantly curled through the one backpack strap he\u2019s wearing, but the bold whiteness of his knuckles gives him away. \u201cDo either of you know where I can find Derek? I haven\u2019t \u2013 I haven\u2019t seen him since\u2026the warehouse, I guess, and I\u2019m not\u2026\u201d<br><br> \u201cDerek\u2026\u201d Isaac trails off, looking sideways at Stiles, who is finding it increasingly difficult to avoid the forehead smashing.<br><br> \u201cDerek\u2019s trying to figure some things out,\u201d Stiles says carefully, doing his best impression of casual. \u201cThere\u2019s\u2026there\u2019s another pack kind of lurking around, and we don\u2019t know much about them, so\u2026\u201d<br><br> It\u2019s a practiced art, lying to werewolves. He doubts Jackson is settled enough to really be able to tell if Stiles is pulling one over on him anyway, but Isaac looks faintly impressed. The trick is to line up a series of truths, peppered through with a handful of nice, long, implication-heavy pauses, and let the other person draw their own conclusions.\u00a0<br><br> \u201cOh.\u201d Jackson looks put out, but he doesn\u2019t look suspicious, so Stiles counts it as a win.<br><br> \u201cIt\u2019s necessary,\u201d Isaac adds gently, \u201cotherwise he\u2019d be here helping you.\u201d<br><br> \u201cYeah,\u201d Jackson shrugs, \u201csure, yeah.\u201d<br><br> \u201cOn the bright side,\u201d there\u2019s probably a bit too much robust enthusiasm in Stiles\u2019 voice \u2013 Jackson looks slightly alarmed \u2013 \u201cyou\u2019ve got us. We\u2019re practically pros by now, between me and Isaac we\u2019ve been around for pretty much all the turns.\u201d<br><br> Jackson visibly deflates, and it takes Stiles a bit of serious deliberation to decide that it\u2019s with relief, not disappointment. He\u2019s almost impressed, really, with how much of an effort Jackson seems to be making to not be his typical raging douche of a self.<br><br> \u201cThat\u2019s \u2013 that\u2019d be good,\u201d Jackson nods decisively. \u201cThanks.\u201d<br><br> \u201cListen,\u201d it\u2019s the genuinely grateful edge of Jackson\u2019s voice that has Stiles leaning forward, barely glancing at Isaac for affirmation that the other teen is on board. \u201cThe pack\u2019s kind of temporarily crashing at my house, for now. Stilinski\u2019s Home for Wayward Werewolves, you know. If you want you can swing by after school, or whenever.\u201d<br><br> \u201cI\u2019m sure you have approximately two million questions,\u201d Isaac picks up, smiling reassuringly. \u201cErica and I can probably help a lot, and Encyclopedia Brown over here knows entirely too much for someone who\u2019s still human.\u201d<br><br> \u201cAre you sure?\u201d Jackson frowns, and the question is directed at Stiles. He has a brief flash of Jackson and Lydia, together in the harsh glare of Stiles\u2019 Jeep\u2019s headlights, but it\u2019s gone before he can even get a good grasp on it. This is so much more important than any residual hurt he feels over Lydia\u2019s love life.<br><br> \u201cDefinitely,\u201d Stiles nods. \u201cCome over. In fact, I bet Lydia has just as many questions as you do, and I think it\u2019s time she\u2019s gotten her answers too.\u201d<br><br> Jackson studies him for a long moment, fingers so tight on his backpack that Stiles is genuinely shocked that he hasn\u2019t pierced the skin of his palm with wolfed-out claws. He finally nods, once seemingly to himself, then again to Stiles and Isaac.<br><br> \u201cYeah, okay,\u201d Jackson says, hiking his backpack a little higher up on his back and pushing himself to his feet. \u201cLydia\u2019s got some meeting or another after last period, but we\u2019ll swing by after?\u201d <em><br><br></em>Isaac waits until Jackson is gone from the cafeteria before turning wide eyes on Stiles, who shakes his head frantically and pulls his phone out of his pocket before Isaac can interrupt.<br><br><em>l8r he can hear.</em><br><br> He types, tilting the screen towards Isaac. The werewolf nods, and Stiles is so fucking grateful, for just a moment, that someone else just <em>gets it</em> without questioning him.<br><br> In the complete opposite feeling of the first half of the day, the afternoon drags at a painfully, agonizingly slow crawl. Stiles spends most of Chem ignoring Scott and Allison, most of Econ panicking about whether or not he is<em> even remotely</em> ready to sit in the same room as Jackson and Lydia together, and the majority of English Lit whispering things that make Isaac snicker despite the fact that he\u2019s sitting all the way across the room. Scott looks impatiently confused by the entire proceeding, and Stiles takes a perverse amount of pleasure in that knowledge. Fine. See how he likes being left in the dark.<br><br> He does, actually, need to talk to Scott for real though, so he makes a point of snagging his best friend by the back of the shirt before he can go barreling out to meet Allison.<br><br> \u201cWait,\u201d Stiles says quickly. \u201cFirst of all, don\u2019t rush, let her wait on you for a change. Don\u2019t look too eager, you guys are just <em>friends</em>.\u201d He instantly feels bad about the last minute emphasis, but Scott\u2019s already looking pretty bleak about the entire situation, there\u2019s not much Stiles can do to make it worse. \u201cI really do need to talk to you though, it\u2019s like, massively important in the immediate future. Call me when you\u2019re done studying or making puppy eyes or whatever, please?\u201d<br><br> \u201cYeah,\u201d Scott nods, \u201cabsolutely.\u201d<br><br> \u201cDon\u2019t make too much of an ass of yourself,\u201d Stiles teases, shoving Scott towards the door with a grin that he has to put a little bit too much effort into. Scott waves him off in response, practically running into the doorframe in his eagerness to get out of the classroom, and Stiles can\u2019t help the frustrated sigh the second Scott\u2019s gone.<br><br> Isaac\u2019s waiting by his Jeep, having slipped out of the room the minute Stiles made a move towards Scott, regressing back to his old James Dean wannabe impersonation as he watches Stiles cross the parking lot.<br><br> \u201cMy birthday is April 8th,\u201d Stiles states, unlocking his door and throwing his backpack into the back seat.<br><br> \u201cThat\u2019s fascinating, tell me more,\u201d Isaac teases, climbing into the passenger seat.<br><br> \u201cYou, Erica, and Derek can all pitch in and buy me my very own leather jacket,\u201d Stiles continues, ignoring the interruption. \u201cI feel like it\u2019s mandatory if I want to hang out with the cool kids.\u201d<br><br> Isaac laughs, fingering the jacket in question as Stiles eases back out of the parking spot and hopes to God there are no lurking werewolves waiting to jump out in front of his hood (it happened once, and therefore it\u2019s a legitimate concern).<br><br> \u201cThey\u2019re a bit much, aren\u2019t they,\u201d Isaac shrugs, \u201cbut they hold up nice in a fight, you know? A sweatshirt would rip the second the claws came out, but the leather lasts a couple seconds longer.\u201d<br><br> \u201cThat,\u201d Stiles nods, thinking of Erica\u2019s mostly unscathed arms, \u201cactually makes sense.\u201d He pulls the Jeep out of the lot, scanning the area for any sign of a telltale Porsche \u2013 he and Isaac seem to reach the same conclusion at the same time.<br><br> \u201cHoly shit,\u201d Stiles breathes.<br><br> Isaac, almost simultaneously, groans, \u201cI can\u2019t believe we forgot about Jackson.\u201d<br><br> \u201c<em>Forgot</em>,\u201d Stiles wails, bracing his forehead against his steering wheel the second they hit a red light. \u201c<em>Forgot</em>. Like we didn\u2019t spend God-knows how long trying to hunt and catch his stupid scaly ass, how the fuck did we forget the end result of that one?\u201d<br><br> \u201cDerek\u2019s gonna eviscerate us,\u201d Isaac whimpers, frowning balefully at Stiles.<br><br> \u201cDerek?\u201d he snorts. \u201cDerek forgot too. He never would have pulled this emo bullshit if he remembered he had a freaking werewolf puppy running loose. Jesus,\u201d Stiles sighs, \u201cwhat the fuck are we gonna do?\u201d<br><br> \u201cFull moon\u2019s not for a while,\u201d Isaac reminds him. Stiles has a feeling the reminder is just as much for Isaac as it is for Stiles, but it\u2019s reassuring nonetheless. Derek will be back to full-functioning form by then if Stiles has to personally drag him back into the real world, so all they have to do is stall Jackson a bit. Answer some questions. Make a few executive decisions.<br><br> \u201cOkay,\u201d Stiles exhales slowly, \u201cokay. Solid game plan. We just have to give Jackson enough to keep him happy. And Lydia \u2013 well, Lydia\u2019s smart enough that she\u2019ll find the answers on her own if we don\u2019t give them to her, so I don\u2019t feel bad telling her. If Derek has a problem with it he probably should have said something when Lydia helped raise the dead. I\u2019m starting to wonder if we should maybe bring Danny in too \u2013 it might be useful, having someone who can keep Jackson on the proverbial short leash if need be. Why are you looking at me like that Isaac.\u201d<br><br> Isaac is shamelessly staring at Stiles with a small smirk on his face, one eyebrow raised as he waits out the other teen\u2019s rant. Stiles glares back at him, pouting at the clear amusement.<br><br> \u201cYou know,\u201d Isaac says carefully, keeping his eyes trained on Stiles\u2019 face like he\u2019s studying the brunet\u2019s reaction. \u201cThe thing about being in a pack is that pack looks out for their own. We take care of each other, have each other\u2019s backs. Pack\u2019s about safety and security and having that to fall back on, knowing that even if you drop the ball there\u2019ll be someone else to pick it up. It was one of Derek\u2019s biggest selling points, and I\u2019m pretty sure it\u2019s why he picked me and Boyd, at least, if not Erica too.\u201d<br><br> \u201cMust be nice,\u201d Stiles nods, \u201cwhen it works. When there\u2019s actually enough people in a pack for that safety net to exist.\u201d<br><br> Isaac frowns, like Stiles isn\u2019t going the direction Isaac wants him to, and he waits a few beats before trying again from a different angle.<br><br> \u201cScott said Derek wasn\u2019t his Alpha,\u201d he reminds Stiles bluntly. \u201cI get that. I think it\u2019s appallingly dumb, but that\u2019s a separate conversation. Scott said no.\u201d<br><br> \u201cI remember,\u201d Stiles agrees, \u201cI was there.\u201d<br><br> \u201cRight,\u201d Isaac nods. \u201c<em>Scott</em> said he wasn\u2019t a part of Derek\u2019s pack.\u201d<br><br> \u201cWell, okay yeah. Sure. But I mean, Derek even said, Scott had his own little pack before his temporary partnership with Team Leather, me and Allison, maybe even his mom and my dad and whoever else. So Scott joins Derek\u2019s pack and, as the supposed Alpha, that means me and Allison and whoever merge packs too.\u201d<br><br> \u201cExactly,\u201d Isaac agrees, nodding along so emphatically that his curls are going slightly haywire. \u201cBut <em>Scott</em> defected. Scott didn\u2019t say \u2018me and my pack are leaving you and yours,\u2019 he said \u2018peace bye I\u2019m outty.\u2019\u201d<br><br> \u201cSo what\u2019s the difference?\u201d<br><br> \u201cThe difference, dear Stiles, is that Scott made his decision for himself. That doesn\u2019t mean you don\u2019t get to make your own decision.\u201d<br><br> \u201cYou\u2019re asking me to choose Derek over Scott,\u201d Stiles protests, focusing the brunt of his glare on the 5-miles-under-the-speed-limit grandmother driving in front of him instead of turning it on Isaac. \u201cIt\u2019s <em>Scott</em>, man, he\u2019s like my brother.\u201d<br><br> \u201cI\u2019m not asking you to choose anyone,\u201d Isaac insists, tone calm and placating. It\u2019s a far cry from the Isaac Stiles used to see around school, always so easily cowed and intimidated, always quick to avoid a confrontation. He likes this change, this newly assertive Isaac, and he likes it even better now that Isaac\u2019s coming down from his post-bite douchebag high. \u201cI\u2019m just saying, you act like pack. You feel like pack. You use the royal we when talking about Derek\u2019s pack, like you\u2019re a part of it. And yeah, Scott\u2019s your best friend, Scott\u2019s your brother, and he always will be. But if it came down to the wire, if you were in deep and you needed backup and you needed help, which one of them would you trust to be there to save your sorry ass?\u201d<br><br> He wants to say Scott. Every fiber of his being wants to say Scott, every piled up second of every year he\u2019s spent with Scott at his side: his best friend, his only friend. He <em>should</em> say Scott, it\u2019s on the tip of his tongue to do so. The words are on the tip of his tongue, but there\u2019s a phantom hand against his chest, wasting precious seconds urging him to run, and a solid mass between him and Peter, him and Isaac.<br><br> He doesn\u2019t say anything.</p>\n<p><em><br></em>\u201cBut. Why.\u201d<br><br> \u201cBecause the alternative is having a loose cannon of a werewolf running around Beacon Hills,\u201d Stiles sighs. \u201cWell. Another one.\u201d<br><br> \u201cRude,\u201d Isaac calls from the kitchen. Stiles and Erica ignore him.<br><br> \u201cHe\u2019s whiny, and rude, and an over-privileged asshole,\u201d Erica argues, like it will actually change anything. \u201cI can\u2019t believe Derek bit him.\u201d<br><br> \u201cOh, yeah,\u201d Stiles snorts, rolling his eyes. \u201cBecause you guys were all sunshine and butterflies and sharing your cookies with the class when Derek bit <em>you</em>.\u201d<br><br> \u201c<em>Rude</em>,\u201d Isaac yells again, and is, again, promptly ignored.<br><br> \u201cThat\u2019s different,\u201d Erica insists, inspecting the finally-healed skin between her knuckles. \u201cJackson\u2019s always been a jerk. Always. He\u2019s not power-tripping now, he\u2019s been on a douchebag power trip for his entire life.\u201d<br><br> That\u2026Stiles has to give her. Hell, twenty four hours ago he would have been the one making her argument. But something about the quiet way Jackson had approached them at lunch, the conscientious effort to be polite, coupled with the knowledge that Jackson was so completely out of his depth right now, it tugs uncomfortably at the pitying part of Stiles\u2019 heart. Besides, he has a feeling they\u2019re all floundering a bit right now, pulling themselves back together only to find that some of the pieces don\u2019t quite fit back into their original pigeon holes.<br><br> \u201cHe\u2019s pack,\u201d Isaac says, leaving the kitchen in favor of the living room couch. \u201cMaybe he doesn\u2019t really feel like it yet, but he is, whether we want him or not.\u201d<br><br> \u201cWhat about Lydia?\u201d the switch is obvious; Erica knows she\u2019s lost round one, but Stiles can tell she\u2019s going to put up a struggle on this one too.<br><br> \u201cLydia\u2019s been out of the loop for long enough,\u201d Stiles reminds her. \u201cWe should have told her the second she was out of the hospital, and we didn\u2019t, that\u2019s not fair.\u201d<br><br> \u201cNeither is rubbing your face in her and Jackson\u2019s little fairy tale, love-conquers-all romance saga,\u201d the blonde grumbles. \u201cI\u2019d rather let Jackson whimper off into omega-dom than you leave the pack.\u201d<br><br> He\u2019ll concentrate later on the fact that Erica, like Isaac, seems to assume he\u2019s a member of Derek\u2019s pack, not Scott\u2019s. For now Stiles is too busy with the fierce rush of gratitude that Erica\u2019s protesting Lydia\u2019s presence on his behalf.<br><br> \u201cJackson\u2019s pack,\u201d he shakes his head, smiling at Erica\u2019s pout. \u201cHe needs to be with you guys, at least, and he really needs Derek. Lydia\u2019s\u2026well, it\u2019s pretty obvious they\u2019re a package deal, yeah? So I\u2019m just going to have to man up and get over it.\u201d Stiles means it, too. Passing commentary about fifteen year plans and all aside, Stiles isn\u2019t stupid. Lydia loves Jackson so fiercely it literally saved all their lives \u2013 there\u2019s no way in all of heaven and hell he\u2019s getting in the middle of a bond like that. Hell, at this point, as much as it hurts, he\u2019s not even sure he wants to.<br><br> \u201cI still don\u2019t like it,\u201d Erica mumbles petulantly.<br><br> \u201cWell deal,\u201d Isaac says suddenly, pushing himself up off the couch and crossing over to the window, \u201c\u2019cause they\u2019re here.\u201d<br><br> It\u2019s\u2026it\u2019s awkward. Jackson\u2019s clearly still making an effort not to be a stuck up dick, and Lydia\u2019s tiptoeing around Stiles like she\u2019s not quite sure how to talk to him, which has Erica increasingly on edge. Isaac does most of the talking, answering any questions Jackson can think of and volunteering some Jackson hasn\u2019t thought of yet. Stiles fills in what he can when he sees fit, and even though Lydia doesn\u2019t quite look at him, she hangs on his every word.<br><br> Frustration hits its optimal peak when Erica outright growls at Lydia. Stiles glares at her until she sheepishly apologizes to Lydia, who staunchly and impressively held her ground, before grabbing Lydia\u2019s arm and urging her to her feet.<br><br> \u201cCome on,\u201d he says firmly. \u201cYou and I are going for a walk. And Creepy McCreeps One, Two, and Three are going to stay here and talk about wolfy things.\u201d<br><br> Nobody protests, which is a shockingly nice change of pace, and Stiles waits until they\u2019re half a block away from prying werewolf ears before shoving his hands in his pockets and turning awkwardly to look at Lydia.<br><br> \u201cStiles\u2026\u201d she says quietly, and he just shakes his head. He doesn\u2019t need her to say it, doesn\u2019t want to hear it from her. It\u2019s easier, in some strange way, if it goes without her saying anything.<br><br> \u201cListen, Lydia, I get it,\u201d he shifts his weight, fixing his eyes on the ground beneath his feet. \u201cYou and Jackson\u2026I get it. What you did for him was amazing, and how much he needs you is <em>painfully</em> obvious, and I\u2019m not stupid enough to try to get in the way of that. You just,\u201d he exhales slowly, extracting one hand from his pocket to scrub at his close-cropped hair, \u201cyou gotta give me a little bit of time with it.\u201d<br><br> \u201cI don\u2019t want to hurt you,\u201d she says quickly, biting her lip like she\u2019s immediately regretting her words. \u201cI really like you Stiles, just\u2026as a friend. Wait that sounds horrible, that\u2019s not what I meant.\u201d<br><br> She looks frustrated, and flustered, and it\u2019s so unbelievably out of character for Lydia Martin that Stiles can\u2019t help but laugh. He loves this girl, he probably always will love this girl, but he\u2019s going to have to learn to shift it to a more platonic level. He thinks he can. He thinks it might be worth it \u2013 something tells him he and Lydia could do some serious damage together, two clearly brilliant and awesome humans running with a pack of wolves.<br><br> \u201cI know what you mean,\u201d he assures her. \u201cWe\u2019re kind of hanging on the cusp of a wolf pack that may or may want us to be their token human members. We, Miss Martin, need to stick together. United front of badass humanity against Alpha and the Pups.\u201d<br><br> Lydia exhales, nodding slightly before glancing up to meet Stiles\u2019 eyes. There\u2019s a moment of silence, a soft second where neither of them so much as breathes, until Lydia lets out a single, slightly shrill giggle. She immediately slaps a hand over her mouth, looking slightly horrified, but Stiles only shakes his head and cracks a broad grin, and that seems to be all the permission she needs. Soon they\u2019re both outright laughing, Lydia with her face buried in her hands and Stiles crouching down over the sidewalk, bracing himself against his knees. There\u2019s more than a slight note of hysteria in the sound, but compared to what the alternative could be Stiles thinks maybe this is alright.<br><br> \u201cWerewolves,\u201d Lydia breathes, finally. She drops down to the ground next to where Stiles is still crouching, tucking her dress neatly underneath her and perching on the curb. Stiles shifts around until he can join her, long legs splayed out into the empty road in front of them.<br><br> \u201cWerewolves,\u201d he agrees. \u201cFucking werewolves.\u201d<br><br> \u201cMy boyfriend is a werewolf,\u201d she says disbelievingly, and Stiles can tell it\u2019s the first time Lydia\u2019s actually stated the obvious out loud.<br><br> \u201cAnd before that he was a lizard. Kind of,\u201d Stiles adds helpfully, earning himself a gentle slap on his thigh.<br><br> It still hurts. It\u2019s still fresh, and it still stings when Lydia says \u2018boyfriend,\u2019 and it\u2019s definitely not something he\u2019s going to get over overnight. But Lydia asks about how Scott got turned, and what kind of research Stiles has done, and whether or not he\u2019d be willing to share some of it with her, and she leans into his side and debates the pros and cons of different search engines with him, and Stiles thinks that maybe this will be okay.<br><br> \u201cSo there\u2019s one thing I still don\u2019t get.\u201d Lydia sounds hesitant, and Stiles thinks he knows what\u2019s coming. It was only a matter of time \u2013 she was there, too, when Scott declared himself separate from Derek, and since the question of his loyalties just seems to be <em>such</em> a hot topic lately... \u201cI don\u2019t want to say whose side are you on, because it\u2019s not about sides, but \u2013\u201d<br><br> \u201cYeah, I know,\u201d Stiles nods. \u201cFor someone who claims to be a member of Scott\u2019s pack, I\u2019ve been awfully involved in Derek\u2019s lately. Isaac beat you to the punch, we had this conversation earlier.\u201d<br><br> \u201cDo you have to pick one?\u201d<br><br> Stiles doesn\u2019t look at her, focuses on picking at a fraying aglet on his left shoe. \u201cI don\u2019t really know what the other options are,\u201d he says eventually, peeling at the split plastic. He can feel Lydia\u2019s hazel eyes on him, sharp and intelligent and not missing a thing, and he can\u2019t help but hope that brilliant, wonderful Lydia will have a solution.<br><br> \u201cBut you want to be a part of Derek\u2019s pack. There wouldn\u2019t be a dilemma if you didn\u2019t.\u201d It\u2019s obvious in the matter of fact way she says it, Lydia\u2019s confirming what she already knows, not asking.<br><br> \u201cIt\u2019s nice, having people around,\u201d Stiles shrugs, smirking slightly. \u201cNo one\u2019s ever growled at someone because they think she\u2019s hurting my feelings before.\u201d<br><br> \u201cThat,\u201d Lydia scoffs, \u201cis only because you never saw the absolute daggers of death Reyes used to glare at me. Believe me, if she could have growled, she would have.\u201d<br><br> Stiles, if the way his face heats up is any indication, blushes as red as his hoody.<br><br> \u201cThe point, though,\u201d Lydia continues, blessedly ignoring him, \u201cis that maybe you wouldn\u2019t have to choose if you could convince Scott not to break off and try to start his own pack.\u201d<br><br> Honestly, the idea hadn\u2019t occurred to him. Well. No, it had. Of course it had, Isaac had even mentioned it himself. But Stiles had dismissed it almost as quickly as he\u2019d thought it, because Scott had made himself clear, and Scott could be irritatingly bullheaded about things when he wanted to be (usually, of course, when it was most inconvenient for Stiles).<br><br> \u201cScott\u2019s pretty firmly in the anti-Derek camp right now,\u201d he reminds Lydia. She should know, she saw it herself, but then again, there had been a mostly dead and entirely naked Jackson in the room at the time, so.<br><br> \u201cYes, well,\u201d Lydia uncrosses her legs and plants her feet firmly underneath her before standing up and offering a hand to Stiles, \u201cDerek\u2019s not here right now, is he?\u201d<br><br> Stiles mulls that one over as he allows her to pull him upright, tossing the words around contemplatively as they wander back to the Stilinski house. Derek <em>isn\u2019t </em>here, but the pack is. And maybe Scott isn\u2019t Team Derek, but he sure as hell better be Team Stiles, and he seems to be the head cheerleader for Team Isaac these days, and maybe if they played it right they could convince Scott that the pros of being in a pack outweighed the cons of having to deal with Derek fumbling his way through being their Alpha.<br><br> \u201cSo, how do we do it then?\u201d he asks finally, stalling halfway up the steps of his front stoop. Lydia looks back at him with a superior smile, like she\u2019d timed out exactly how long it was going to take him to ask exactly that and was just waiting for him to catch up to her.<br><br> \u201cHow do you sell Scott on pack life? You start by pulling together enough of a pack to function as a valid selling point.\u201d<br><br> She leaves him to think that one over too, letting herself into the house and wandering back towards the kitchen. He doesn\u2019t bother asking how she knew to check there first, considering they\u2019d left Jackson, Isaac, and Erica in the living room, just follows her down the hallway until he finds the three werewolves around the kitchen table.<br><br> \u201cJackson wants to tell Danny,\u201d Isaac announces by way of greeting. Erica\u2019s doing some weird non-verbal girl communication with Lydia, and Stiles has no idea what\u2019s happening but nobody growls at anyone, so he figures that\u2019s an improvement. He takes the empty chair between Isaac and Jackson and nods.<br><br> \u201cI think he should,\u201d he says, \u201cif I have a vote in this. Everyone could benefit from a little more Danny Mahealani in their lives. And I could benefit from having direct access to a world-class hacker.\u201d<br><br> \u201cNow you\u2019re just using me for my friends, Stilinski,\u201d Jackson whines, and Stiles is pleasantly surprised to realize he\u2019s teasing. Interesting.<br><br> \u201cEveryone\u2019s gotta bring something to the table,\u201d Stiles fires back cheerfully, \u201cand, well, I suppose your contribution is going to have to be Danny and Lydia, seeing as you don\u2019t have much else to offer.\u201d<br><br> Isaac looks at him like he\u2019s an idiot, but Jackson just laughs. It\u2019s a fascinating turn of events, one that Stiles isn\u2019t entirely opposed to at all.<br><br> \u201cIsaac and I already agreed we think Danny should know,\u201d Erica interjects, rolling her eyes at Isaac\u2019s expression. \u201cWe were just waiting on you.\u201d<br><br> Because, apparently, his vote counts for something after all. Because this is a pack decision, with the Alpha being gone and all, and, according to Isaac and Erica, Stiles is pack. Huh.<br><br> \u201cGood,\u201d Jackson nods. \u201cAnyway, being temporarily dead and then promptly undead has somehow resulted in mandatory family dinners.\u201d<br><br> Stiles walks Jackson and Lydia out for a slightly-awkward-but-less-so-than-before goodbye before shuffling back into the kitchen and making a beeline for the fridge.<br><br> \u201cLydia thinks we should try to convince Scott to merge the packs,\u201d he tells the remaining two werewolves, confident that they can hear them despite the fact that his head is mostly in the freezer. \u201cMostly by convincing him that pack life is awesome.\u201d<br><br> \u201cExcept right now Derek\u2019s pack consists of two and a half people, a tentative third, and his girlfriend,\u201d Isaac reminds him, abandoning the table in favor of hopping up onto the bit of countertop closest to the fridge.\u00a0<br><br> \u201cAnd maybe Danny,\u201d Erica adds. \u201cBut even then, it\u2019s not much of a pack, is it?\u201d<br><br> \u201cIt\u2019s like when you go away to camp,\u201d Stiles offers, abandoning his quest for some kind of edible vegetable and pulling back out of the freezer. Erica and Isaac give him blank looks in response, and okay, yeah, maybe not the best metaphor given Erica probably spent most of her childhood in and out of doctors\u2019 offices and Isaac\u2026well.<br><br> \u201cWhen you go to sleep away camp they put you in cabins with like, ten other kids, yeah? And those first few days there you know that by the end of the summer these are gonna be your bros, and you\u2019ll do awesome stuff like prank the shit out of other cabins and annoy the hell out of your counselor and shit like that, but you\u2019re not on that level yet so it\u2019s still kind of awkward. We\u2019re the awkward little kids assigned to Derek Cabin and waiting for that glorious bonding moment when everyone becomes overnight bffls.\u201d<br><br> By the time he\u2019s done Erica\u2019s shaking her head with an expression Stiles can only describe as exasperated fondness on her face, but Isaac looks faintly intrigued.<br><br> \u201cSo pack bonding, then,\u201d he says, ducking out of the way when Stiles reaches for the cabinet behind Isaac\u2019s head. \u201cWhat\u2019s something everyone likes? Or something we all have in common?\u201d<br><br> \u201cMovies,\u201d Erica suggests, like that\u2019s not simultaneously the obvious and the impossible.<br><br> \u201cBeing sarcastic, sassy assholes. Sassholes,\u201d Stiles tries, giving up his search with a small sigh and pulling out a box of instant mashed potatoes.<br><br> \u201cWait.\u201d There\u2019s enough thoughtfulness in Erica\u2019s voice for Stiles to turn around; she\u2019s straightened up from where she was slumped over the table, brown eyes bright with whatever\u2019s sparked her interest. \u201cMovie night of appallingly inaccurate werewolf movies with free reign to shamelessly mock their shortcomings.\u201d<br><br> \u201cThat\u2019s\u2026actually kind of brilliant,\u201d Isaac concedes, glancing over to gauge Stiles\u2019 reaction.<br><br> \u201cWhere have you been all my life?\u201d he sighs, grinning at Erica. \u201cYou are brilliant.\u201d<br><br> \u201cWell,\u201d Erica says smugly, \u201cI do try.\u201d<br><br> They spend most of dinner planning it \u2013 Erica pulling up lists of werewolf movies on her phone, Isaac rattling more off from memory (and isn\u2019t <em>that</em> a fun skill Stiles is going to have to explore later, because if Isaac is a movie buff then he might have a new best friend), Stiles making a grocery list for supplies. They\u2019re maybe a little too enthusiastic about it, maybe working a little too hard on something that should be fairly routine for a group of normal teenagers, but it feels good to have a project and a distraction. Besides, Stiles isn\u2019t quite sure he remembers <em>how</em> to be a normal teenager, not anymore.<br><br> So they plan, and Stiles makes dinner and makes lists and promises Erica he\u2019ll stop by the video rental place tomorrow until a shifty-eyed Isaac mentions he might already own most of the movies on Erica\u2019s list, as long as Stiles has an HDMi cable for the flat screen in the living room. They feel a little silly about it, but it\u2019s something to do, and, in particular, something to distract Stiles from the fact that despite his frequent cell phone checks, Scott completely failed to call or text Stiles like he\u2019d promised he would.<br><br> Inevitably, though, the Sheriff comes home just in time to usher them all upstairs to pretend like they\u2019re actually going to get a reasonable night of sleep before school tomorrow. He\u2019s also, apparently, cottoned on to the fact that all three of them have been sleeping in Stiles\u2019 bed, which seems to be a very big No. It\u2019s weird not having Erica in his room, even weirder when he thinks about how backwards his definitions of <em>weird</em> really are lately, and he\u2019s lost on that thought until Erica clears her throat loudly from the doorway.<br><br> \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d he asks, not looking up from his laptop. \u201cIsaac\u2019s in the shower, but it\u2019s yours when he\u2019s done if you want it.\u201d<br><br> \u201cI\u2019m good.\u201d She\u2019s lingering in the doorway, hovering, and that\u2019s enough to make Stiles close his laptop and turn around, giving her his full attention. She gives up after a few long moments, crossing the room and dropping down on the edge of his bed, legs curled up into her chest.<br><br> He\u2019s forgotten, somehow, that underneath Derek\u2019s ill-timed breakdown, and the reemergence of Jackson, and Stiles\u2019 own personal drama with Lydia and Scott and Alpha politics, all of this started with Erica getting thoroughly beat and watching her packmate die.<br><br> \u201cHow are you, though?\u201d he tries, internally cringing.<br><br> \u201cBetter,\u201d she mumbles. \u201cNot <em>better</em> better. But. Better.\u201d<br><br> Stiles recognizes Don\u2019t Wanna Talk About It. It\u2019s a front he\u2019s projected and perfected for years; it\u2019s not hard to pick it up from someone else when you know what to look for.<br><br> \u201cI wanted to apologize, actually. About earlier,\u201d Erica says finally, glancing over at him. \u201cWith Lydia.\u201d<br><br> \u201cYou don\u2019t \u2013\u201d<br><br> \u201cNo, wait,\u201d she holds up one hand, interrupting him. \u201cI used to have this\u2026I used to daydream about finally getting your attention, about you looking away from Lydia long enough to realize how great we could be. And I had this one, in particular, about that stereotypical teen movie moment, you know, when you\u2019re totally over her and with me and happy, and <em>that\u2019s</em> when Lydia finally notices you and tries to get you back. And you, because hey, my fantasy, totally shut her down cold, because you realize how much better things are with me than they ever could have been with her.\u201d<br><br> \u201cErica\u2026\u201d Stiles says softly. He doesn\u2019t know how to tell her he wishes he\u2019d realized that too, wishes they could rewind back far enough to where none of <em>this </em>happened. Because she\u2019s right, he knows it \u2013 they would have been phenomenal together. If she\u2019d pulled his attention away from Lydia long enough for him to notice Erica, Erica would have been eight different kinds of perfect for him.<br><br> \u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d she shrugs, and she\u2019s smiling like she means it. \u201cIt was a while ago. Besides, I think I\u2019d have someone else in mind to play my role now, if that scenario ever came up.\u201d<br><br> Stiles frowns in confusion, but Erica doesn\u2019t pause long enough for him to ask.<br><br> \u201cBut anyway, the thing I always wanted to say to you was that you deserve a million times better than Lydia Martin. You really do. Because yes, Lydia is smart, and beautiful, and lovely, and she would focus all that power on molding you into exactly what she wants, and that, Stiles, would be a travesty. Because I think you\u2019re pretty damn awesome the way you are.\u201d<br><br> He can\u2019t help it. Doesn\u2019t really want to stop it, even if he could. Stiles rolls his desk chair forward until he\u2019s close enough to cup Erica\u2019s jaw between his hands and places a single, fleeting kiss against her lips.<br><br> She gets it. He knows she does, and it\u2019s a relief not to have to explain it. There\u2019s nothing there; it\u2019s not meant to be anything more than an acknowledgement of the single nicest thing anyone\u2019s ever said to him, an apology for failing them both so spectacularly in the past, a single second to honor what could have been. She presses into it for a second, just long enough for it to count for something, before pulling back.<br><br> \u201cIf you leave this pack,\u201d she says quietly, \u201cI will hang Scott from the rafters in the gym. By his balls.\u201d<br><br> Stiles laughs so hard he nearly cries.</p>\n<p><em><br></em>\u201cOkay, seriously, what gives. First it\u2019s Isaac, now Erica too? And you smell like\u2026Jackson. And Lydia. What\u2019s going <em>on</em>, Stiles?\u201d<br><br> Something in him breaks a little. Scott sounds so accusatory he\u2019s practically snarling, and the grip he has on Stiles\u2019 arm is just on this side of inhumanly tight, and Erica\u2019s at his shoulder making a low noise in her throat that\u2019s probably not calming Scott down, and Stiles is already so done with today and it\u2019s not even first period yet.<br><br> \u201cGo,\u201d he tells Erica lightly, touching his fingertips to her wrist. \u201cI got this.\u201d<br><br> She leaves, but not without enough flare to prove how violently opposed to the situation she is, and Scott\u2019s torn between gaping at her and glaring at Stiles. Stiles can still see Isaac out of the corner of his eye, melting back against the nearest bed of lockers like he\u2019s doing his best to stay out of the way, and Stiles lets him. It might be good, for him or Scott, he\u2019s not really sure, if Isaac\u2019s there too.<br><br> \u201cYou would know,\u201d he tells Scott calmly, leveling his best friend with a look that belies his conversational tone, \u201cif you\u2019d, actually, for once, actually torn yourself away from your daily Allison meltdown long enough to remember that I had <em>literally life-changing important things I needed to talk to you about</em>.\u201d<br><br> There\u2019s a moment where Scott looks like he might feel guilty, but he flashes right through that to hurt, and then angry, and then he\u2019s snapping right back. \u201cLook, I\u2019m sorry Lydia picked Jackson over you, and I get that you need to vent \u2013\u201d<br><br> \u201cBoyd\u2019s dead.\u201d<br><br> Scott closes his mouth so abruptly Stiles is pretty sure he actually hears teeth click together.<br><br> \u201cErica got away, but only just. They were attacked, after they somehow managed to escape being shot repeatedly by your ex-girlfriend and then electrocuted for hours on end by her psychotic grandpa, by an alpha pack. Yeah, a pack. Of Alphas. Every single one of whom could rip each and every one of us to pieces. Including Derek. Who, by the way, has gone AWOL, since he lost his <em>entire pack</em> in under 24 hours. Again. So you know what, Scott, you focus on your fake friendship with Katniss, because without her, you\u2019re going to find yourself an Omega by default, and I hear that\u2019s a pretty shitty place to be.\u201d<br><br> It takes Scott a few seconds to recovery, but Stiles is happy to let it sink in. Not happy. Smug. Content. He\u2019s content to watch Scott soak it in, to feel the weight of just some of what he\u2019s been missing in his\u2026absence. He can tell when the last point hits home, when Scott\u2019s shoved everything else aside to recognize what Stiles implied.<br><br> \u201cNot even a week ago,\u201d Scott says quietly, and there\u2019s ice in his tone, a hard line driven directly at Stiles, \u201cyou told me I still had you. That I\u2019d always have you. So what, Erica bats her eyelashes and suddenly you\u2019re gone?\u201d<br><br> Stiles closes his eyes and inhales a long-suffering breath. He\u2019s certain that the only thing holding him back from punching Scott right in his stupidly crooked jaw is the tough-learned knowledge that it will do more damage to him than it will to Scott.\u00a0<br><br> \u201cYou have me,\u201d he exhales finally, opening his eyes and glaring right back. \u201cYou\u2019ll always have me. But I\u2019m starting to think that maybe I don\u2019t have you, and right now, with everything that\u2019s going on, I can\u2019t afford that doubt.\u201d<br><br> The bell doesn\u2019t ring the way he wants it to; doesn\u2019t signal the perfect ending of the argument that lets Stiles have both the last word and a legitimate excuse to walk away. He finds, in this particular moment, that he doesn\u2019t care. He stalks off on his own, hesitating only long enough to glance once at Isaac, tearing his gaze away from the dumbstruck look on Scott\u2019s face, and for Isaac to nod back with the barest incline of his head.<br><br> Stiles walks away before Scott can catch up. He doesn\u2019t bother with first period; finds himself instead wandering into the empty natatorium. They\u2019d drained the pool after the incident with the kanima \u2013 standard procedure for glass breaking anywhere near it, let alone an entire panel of the glass ceiling shattering \u2013 and, since swim season was long over, hadn\u2019t bothered refilling it yet. The overwhelming stench of chlorine still hung heavy in the air though, and Stiles found himself, inexplicably, calming down just a little bit more with each inhale.<br><br> He stays there through second period and half of third, up in the mezzanine level with his legs dangling over the edge and his elbows propped against the third rung up on the safety rail. A campus security guard shows up twenty minutes into third period, lazy on the first level and not thorough enough to look up and catch him, but it\u2019s enough motivation for Stiles to leave, haul his backpack up off the floor and wander the long way back through the locker room before meandering through the hallways.<br><br> He kills fourth period by pretending to proofread his essay on <em>To Kill a Mockingbird</em>, like he hadn\u2019t written the essay last weekend and proofread it twice since then, but has a hard time coming up with a reason to avoid lunch. It\u2019s <em>lunch</em>, first of all, and Scott\u2019s definitely not masochistic enough to make a scene in the cafeteria. Besides, he has a lurking suspicion that Erica will come find him if he doesn\u2019t show up, and he doubts that will be a particularly pleasant experience.<br><br> Sure enough, she\u2019s waiting for him at his usual table. Scott and, surprisingly, Isaac, are notably absent, but neither of them comment on it as Erica picks carefully at her apple and Stiles rambles about the pros and cons of straight versus curly fries. It comes as something as a surprise, really, when a lunch tray drops down on the table next to Stiles\u2019 elbow, and for the second time in his life Stiles is greeted with the sight of Danny, Lydia, and Jackson dropping down from on high to consort with the common folk.\u00a0<br><br> \u201cHey,\u201d Danny says cheerfully, sinking gracefully into the chair on Stiles\u2019 right.<br><br> \u201cHeard you and McCall broke up this morning.\u201d Jackson just dives right in before he\u2019s even fully seated, wisely leaving an empty chair between himself and Erica.<br><br> \u201c<em>Jackson</em>,\u201d Lydia hisses, claiming the empty chair and throwing the mother of all scolding glares his way.<br><br> \u201cWhat,\u201d he shrugs, \u201cI was just going to say that, if Stilinski\u2019s so inclined, I\u2019ve been looking for a good excuse to punch McCall for weeks. Arguably years.\u201d<br><br> Stiles, to everyone\u2019s apparent surprise, bursts out laughing.<br><br> \u201cShit,\u201d he sighs, ducking his head and shaking away the laughter. \u201cYou\u2019re actually more terrifying when you\u2019re trying to be nice then you ever were when you hated me, Whittemore.\u201d<br><br> \u201cThank you,\u201d Jackson replies magnanimously, and that, more than anything, breaks the ice.<br><br> Lunch goes by in an infinitely better time than Stiles would have expected, given his day so far. Danny, who Jackson must have ran to tell the second family dinner was over, distracts Stiles with question after question after question, and his careful attention to each of Stiles\u2019 answers is enough to prove bringing Danny in was a good decision. Lydia makes an effort with Erica, an actual effort in more than just pretty girls talking about girl things, and Jackson bounces back and forth. There\u2019re a couple of stall outs, a couple false starts and long, hanging moments of silence before someone jumps to fill them, but all in all, it\u2019s kind of nice. Erica eventually brings up their idea for a pack movie night, playing it way too cool and casual for someone who had spent so much time the night before planning it out, but Lydia and Danny, and even Jackson, are quick to agree. Lydia nudges Stiles foot under the table, smiling her approval at him, and Stiles is sheepishly proud of the way he doesn\u2019t react to the attention.<br><br> The afternoon\u2019s harder. Stiles has to go to Chem because Harris will probably make up at least three excuses to give him detention in his absence, Econ because why pass up an excuse to hear Coach Finstock\u2019s babbling lunacy, and English so he can hand in his paper, but Scott\u2019s in all three, and Stiles can <em>feel</em> Scott\u2019s eyes on him, oscillating between hurt and angry like Scott can\u2019t make up his mind.<br><br> Stiles has a lurking suspicion that wherever Isaac disappeared to at lunch, it had something to do with Scott, because Isaac books it straight out of English the second the bell rings, before Stiles has even finished putting his books back in his bag. Scott, on the other hand, is clearly lingering, not quite looking at Stiles but still hovering.<br><br> Stiles doesn\u2019t bother hiding the way he sighs exasperatedly, staring at Scott until he has no choice but to look at Stiles. Stiles kind of\u2026flails his arms in a faintly dramatic, \u2018get on with it\u2019 kind of way, and Scott looks positively constipated in response.<br><br> \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he says finally, sighing hard enough that his shoulders droop several inches. \u201cStiles, I\u2019m sorry. You were right, you tried multiple times to tell me that you needed to talk to me, and I kept blowing you off. And,\u201d he holds up one hand, anticipating Stiles\u2019 interruption before the kid can even open his mouth, \u201cI know it\u2019s not the first time I\u2019ve done it. Not even close. And I\u2019m sorry, because it\u2019s really not fair at all. I don\u2019t blame you for feeling like you can\u2019t count on me. I probably deserve that, and I definitely haven\u2019t given you much of a reason to think otherwise. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d<br><br> Stiles and Scott have fought, real, genuine fights over more than just which gaming console was superior, a grand total of four times over the course of their friendship. Each time Stiles has managed to hold onto his anger, to hold that burning ember of a grudge, for less than a day. This time, clearly, is no different.<br><br> He meets Scott\u2019s hopeful puppy dog eyes with a wry smile, rolling his eyes. \u201cIsaac talked to you, didn\u2019t he?\u201d<br><br> \u201cTalked?\u201d Scott snorts, returning Stiles\u2019 gaze with a tentative smile of his own. \u201cThat\u2019s one way to put it. Ripped me a new one is another way to put it.\u201d<br><br> \u201c<em>Isaac</em>?\u201d Stiles blinks back his surprise. \u201cSeriously?\u201d<br><br> \u201cYou know that parent voice, that quiet calm one they whip out right around the same time as your middle name, and it always means you\u2019re in deep, deep shit?\u201d Scott implies grimly. Stiles raises both eyebrows, clearly impressed.<br><br> \u201cHuh,\u201d he huffs. \u201cWho knew.\u201d<br><br> They both shift awkwardly for a moment; it\u2019s clear the conversation isn\u2019t over, but neither one of them seems sure which issue to tackle next.<br><br> \u201cHe, uh,\u201d Scott starts finally, \u201calso talked to me a bit about why he thinks splitting my pack from Derek\u2019s is a mistake.\u201d<br><br> \u201cYeah,\u201d Stiles nods, \u201cwe\u2019ve talked about that a bit too.\u201d<br><br> \u201cDid you mean what you\u2026\u201d Scott trails off, clearly not meaning to go that blunt that quickly, and Stiles takes pity on him before Scott can try pulling it back.<br><br> \u201cAbout being a part of Derek\u2019s pack?\u201d<br><br> Scott nods.<br><br> \u201cWell,\u201d Stiles rubs one hand over his buzzed hair, scrubbing his palm down as far as his nose before running back up to the top of his skull. \u201cYeah. Kind of. I meant what I said about always having your back, too, but dude, I really think the best choice is Derek\u2019s pack. For me, definitely, but also for you.\u201d<br><br> \u201cBut, why?\u201d And it\u2019s a testament to the way Scott is actively trying to listen to Stiles right now (and honestly, so much <em>effort</em> from people these days, it\u2019s a nice change of pace) that, despite being so obviously against it himself, there isn\u2019t an ounce accusation in his tone.<br><br> \u201cDid Isaac fill you in on everything?\u201d<br><br> Scott nods again, and Stiles makes some kind of head-bob-motion in response.<br><br> \u201cOkay,\u201d he sighs. \u201cSo there\u2019s kind of a crazy pack of superwolves biding their time before they come kill us all and abscond with Derek, you got that part? And the thing about pack is that it actually <em>makes you stronger</em>. Not just the way we always assumed Derek meant, that it makes him physically stronger, but it makes all of us better. It\u2019s family, and it\u2019s trust, and it\u2019s being secure in the knowledge that you have someone to fall back on, and maybe, in this case, secure in the knowledge that if some crazed wolves decide to kidnap me, the whole fucking cavalry will come after me. Not like last time, when I didn\u2019t even think I\u2019d get you, because I wasn\u2019t sure which side you were on anymore.\u201d<br><br> Scott flinches, visibly, but Stiles thinks he maybe deserves that one and doesn\u2019t bother apologizing for it. There\u2019s no point, anyway, because Scott would know it was a lie.<br><br> \u201cWe\u2019ve never had much family, bro. You get that as much as I do; we are the textbook definition of broken homes. It\u2019s\u2026it\u2019s baffling, a little bit, but I have a really good feeling about this. It\u2019s going to take time, and definitely a lot of work, but this pack, all of us, could be the silver fucking lining in this nightmare.\u201d<br><br> Scott\u2019s quiet for a long moment, and Stiles lets him be. He\u2019s committed to this now, he thinks. Regardless of Scott\u2019s decision, regardless of what Scott thinks is best for him, Stiles knows in his gut that Derek\u2019s his Alpha, that Isaac and Erica, and even Jackson and Lydia and Danny, are his pack.<br><br> \u201cI get what you\u2019re saying about the pack,\u201d Scott says finally, and it\u2019s clear he\u2019s choosing his words carefully. \u201cI do. Or I think I do, at least. But Derek, man\u2026do you really think, if it came down to it, Derek would risk his life to save yours?\u201d<br><br> Stiles can\u2019t even control how fast he snaps back at that, the sudden urgency he feels to correct Scott, to make Scott realize how truly, deeply wrong he is.<br><br> \u201cScott, he <em>has</em>. He has, more than once, which is more than I can say for you. Yeah, fine, you have an annoyingly wonderful habit of swooping in last minute and saving the day in the eleventh hour. But what you miss is that, if it weren\u2019t for Derek, I probably wouldn\u2019t survive long enough to witness your heroic entrance.\u201d<br><br> It\u2019s not fair, because Stiles knows this time that Scott doesn\u2019t deserve it. He knows, after the fact, that there\u2019s always been a good excuse for Scott\u2019s inaction. It\u2019s illogical, and he knows it, but he still can\u2019t quite shake that feeling of betrayal when he risked his life, risked <em>Derek\u2019s</em> life, half-drowned in a pool, and Scott hung up on him.<br><br> \u201cListen,\u201d he tries again, making a concentrated effort at soothing any feathers he might have just ruffled. \u201cI get it, I know you\u2019re there. You\u2019re there as much as you can be, and that\u2019s incredible and I can never thank you enough for it. But that\u2019s my whole point, about pack. Right now you\u2019ve got one werewolf with two mostly helpless humans to look out for, and if we get separated, you inevitably have to choose. But if we were united, one pack under one Alpha, you wouldn\u2019t have to make that choice. It\u2019s okay if you go after Allison, or Isaac, or someone else, because that still leaves five other people to come after me.\u201d<br><br> It\u2019s working, Stiles can tell it is. Maybe not enough to sell Scott entirely, but enough to convince him to at least give it a chance, maybe to come tomorrow night and see the whole pack together, see what that could be like, and Stiles is ready to count that as a huge victory.<br><br> \u201cI still don\u2019t\u2026Derek\u2026\u201d<br><br> \u201cDerek\u2019s a work in progress,\u201d Stiles concedes. \u201cHe is, you\u2019re right about that. But I\u2019m working on it, and so is he. And if you think about it, Scott, if you really sit here and think back about everything you know about Derek Hale\u2026fine, maybe he\u2019s gone about it in completely the wrong way, and he\u2019s shit at showing it, but his heart\u2019s in the right place and you know it.\u201d<br><br> \u201cI\u2019ll think about it,\u201d Scott promises, and it really does feel like a promise he\u2019ll actually keep. \u201cGive me some time.\u201d<br><br> \u201cYeah,\u201d Stiles agrees instantly, because he <em>wants</em> this, he wants Scott to come to a real decision, no more wishy washy back and forth about Derek and his pack. \u201cYeah, of course. Think about it. Talk to me, or Isaac, or whoever, if you have any questions about anything. And come tomorrow night. It\u2019s just movie night at my house, we\u2019ve done that a million times. It doesn\u2019t have to mean anything.\u201d<br><br> \u201cI will,\u201d Scott nods. He shifts his weight back and forth, tugging against the backpack still hanging from his shoulders, and bites his lip once before finally spitting out whatever lingering thought he\u2019s holding back.<br><br> \u201cSo, we okay?\u201d<br><br> \u201cYeah, bro,\u201d Stiles insists. \u201cCourse we are. What, do we have to hug it out to make it official?\u201d<br><br> Apparently they do.<br><em><br></em></p>\n<p><br> It\u2019s an early Friday night dinner \u2013 the Sherriff\u2019s shift starts at 5:30 but Stiles, in an effort to feed his father real food, has managed to wrangle both his dad and Isaac into agreeing to turkey burgers and salad in lieu of their original meat and fries demand. They\u2019ve barely started eating, Stiles graciously ignoring Isaac\u2019s liberal application of ranch dressing (it\u2019s low fat; what Isaac doesn\u2019t know won\u2019t kill him), when Erica sits upright so sharply, so abruptly, that more than one piece of silverware clatters to the table in shock.<br><br> The sound she lets out is something distinctly non-human, something ear-splitting between a shriek and a whine, and she\u2019s out of her seat and through the back door before anyone has time to ask for an explanation. Stiles can do nothing but gape after her, mouth hanging open in unguarded shock, when Isaac is suddenly taking off after her, so fast he upends his chair.<br><br> \u201cWhat the \u2013\u201d the Sherriff marvels, and Stiles is entirely at a loss with a response. He shrugs, entirely unhelpfully, and pushes himself to his feet with significantly more caution than either werewolf had demonstrated.<br><br> \u201cStay here,\u201d Stiles warns, stilling his father\u2019s movement with one outstretched palm. \u201cStay here until I know what it is.\u201d<br><br> There\u2019s a noise of protest at the order, concern more than disobedience, but Stiles ignores it as he moves carefully towards the open door, quickly cataloguing the closest defensive weapons in his mind, just in case, as he rounds the doorway.<br><br> A pile of bodies lie in a tangled heap near the center of the Stilinski\u2019s backyard, and Stiles takes just barely a second to panic before he recognizes the near-hysterical sound of Erica\u2019s tearful laughter. He steps closer, lowering his mental guard with each footfall, until he can make out three distinct figures on his grass.<br><br> Boyd, one hand curled around the back of Erica\u2019s neck, other arm wrapped around Isaac\u2019s waist, face just as bloody and bruised as Erica\u2019s had been and one eye swollen nearly all the way shut, is grinning at Stiles like today is the most glorious, wonderful day on God\u2019s green earth.<br><br> Stiles is inclined to agree. <em><br><br></em></p>\n<p><br> He hadn\u2019t really expected to find Derek at the train depot; sure enough, when Stiles shoves the heavy door open the place looks virtually untouched, definitely unlived in. He\u2019d expected Derek to be at the Hale place even less, but then again, there\u2019re only a limited number of options Stiles is even aware of, and there\u2019s no time like an enforced week of self-reflection to drive him to visit the old property.<br><br> Derek\u2019s car is parked a couple hundred yards from the house, like he couldn\u2019t bear to desecrate the ruins with any more evidence of his continued existence than strictly necessary. Stiles is feeling magnanimous in light of Boyd\u2019s return from the dead; he pulls up into the empty clearing next to the Camaro, leaving his Jeep behind to trek the remaining distance on foot.<br><br> There\u2019s no reaction to Stiles\u2019 appearance, though he\u2019s completely certain that Derek could hear and smell him before he\u2019d even gotten out of the car, but this time Stiles doesn\u2019t go out of his way to demand the older man\u2019s attention. He doesn\u2019t need to, not when Derek is sitting out in broad daylight, hunkered down on one of the sturdier porch steps, elbows on his knees and one palm cradling his temple. It\u2019s not until he\u2019s closer, steps away and still unacknowledged, that Stiles notices the small book in the Alpha\u2019s free hand, a slash of white against the black and grey of Derek\u2019s form.<br><br> Stiles drops himself down to sit on the stair under Derek\u2019s, not really trusting the rotting wood to hold them both, and doesn\u2019t question the automatic draw to sit closer than might ordinarily be considered normal. He\u2019s been starting to consider, lately, that perhaps one of the most consistent truths about his relationship with Derek is their unflinching tactility \u2013 he can\u2019t remember the last time they interacted without shoving or grabbing, jostling the one\u2019s arm or elbowing the other away. They\u2019re so rarely in a calm setting, so rarely together in relative quiet, no looming urgency hanging over them, that Stiles has never really had the opportunity to see if this automatic draw and pull of Derek\u2019s skin worked in non-violent ways too.<br><br> He mulls this over as he sits on the rickety wooden steps, close enough to feel the now-familiar heat of a werewolf\u2019s body filling the inch of space between his shoulder and Derek\u2019s arm. It\u2019s an unusually long silence for Stiles, especially in Derek\u2019s presence, but it\u2019s also an unusually long tolerance of Stiles\u2019 proximity, and he\u2019s tempted to let Derek take the lead on this one. For now.<br><br> Eventually the werewolf leans into him, shifting his weight towards Stiles\u2019 slighter form, tilting his head down towards the bared skin at the back of Stiles\u2019 neck. The boy can tell the moment the scent registers, the moment Derek realizes why Stiles has interrupted Derek\u2019s forced isolation.<br><br> \u201cBoyd\u2026\u201d he says softly, drawing in even closer, every warm exhale spreading goosebumps further along Stiles\u2019 skin.<br><br> \u201cCame home this afternoon,\u201d Stiles nods, shifting just enough to subtly allow the Alpha better access. \u201cShoulda known, really. Erica assumed he was dead \u2013 he didn\u2019t follow her, and I guess it looked pretty bad from her angle, but. Well, first rule of any quality sci-fi, supernatural, or fantasy story is no body, no death, right? I mean, Gandalf, Peter Pettigrew, Sebastian Verlac. Even if she didn\u2019t know better, I should have.\u201d<br><br> Derek didn\u2019t say anything, didn\u2019t need words for Stiles to hear the blatant <em>I have no idea what you\u2019re talking about</em> stare he was almost certainly leveling at the back of the teen\u2019s head.<br><br> \u201cJean Grey.\u201d<br><br> \u201cTechnically that\u2019s Phoenix,\u201d Stiles quips back automatically, \u201cbut I\u2019ll give you\u2026wait a minute.\u201d The words caught up with him all at once, slamming through his awareness with all the subtlety of a freight train. He whips around, stabbing an accusing finger dangerously close to the older man\u2019s nose. \u201cYou sneaky little bitch, you\u2019re secretly a geek.\u201d<br><br> Derek smirks, just a little quirk of the corner of his lip, and Stiles gapes at him.<br><br> \u201cComic books,\u201d he says, deliberately off-handed and accompanied by a small shrug. \u201cI used to\u2026\u201d Derek shifts the arm in his lap, redistributing his weight until he can balance on the elbow still propped against his knee. \u201cWell. I was going to go to school for engineering. Maybe architecture. But I liked anything that involved drawing.\u201d<br><br> He holds his free hand out to Stiles and, sure enough, when the brunet looks down there\u2019s a sketchbook being offered to him, spine cracked deeply enough to hold the page open without anything pinning it down. It\u2019s a rough sketch, none of the precision a proper blueprint would have had, but there\u2019s no doubt in his mind that Stiles is looking at a near-perfect replica of the Hale house in all its glory.<br><br> The sketches go on for several pages, drawings of the house\u2019s exterior from all sides, sketches of old rooms, floor plans. He lingers on the floor plans more than the rest; it takes him longer to realize that these, unlike the previous sketches, are improvements and not memories. The first floor looks relatively like what the bare bones still remaining would suggest, but the second \u2013 Stiles bites back a smile at the small row of bedrooms lining the hall, initials brushed into the corner in an impossibly light, delicate press of graphite against the page. ER gets the corner room and her own bathroom, IL a room with a bay window. VB, Stiles notices, has been smudged to near nothingness.<br><br> \u201cTechnically it\u2019s not a new place outside of the train depot,\u201d Derek says quietly, watching over Stiles\u2019 shoulder until he\u2019s certain the teen has made it through all the drawings. \u201cAt least, not yet. So it doesn\u2019t really hold up that end of the deal. And these are a few weeks old. It might make more sense, at this point, to scrap it.\u201d<br><br> Stiles frowns, leaning his weight back until his spine digs into the lip of the stair Derek\u2019s perched on and his side, from shoulder to knee, is pressed against the warm length of Derek\u2019s. The werewolf doesn\u2019t pull away - if anything, he pushes a little further into it.<br><br> \u201cThat,\u201d Stiles compromises, flipping back to the interior floor plans again, \u201cdepends entirely on how flexible you can be with this second floor. Boyd, I think, will be a little upset if you give away his room on account of being fake dead.\u201d<br><br> Derek\u2019s scoff hides a snort of amusement, and he\u2019s close enough now that it ruffles the short hairs at the base of Stiles\u2019 neck.<br><br> \u201cAlso, Jackson,\u201d he reminds Derek, \u201cwho has been alarmingly not-douchey this week, so that should be an interesting treat for you. And, solely for the purpose of not messing up your delicate organization, my initials are not SS. Just so you know what to mark it when you finish designing my suite. Although if it\u2019s on the third floor you better remember to add an elevator.\u201d<br><br> Derek tugs the sketchbook back, reaching one hand behind him for a long-abandoned pencil. <em>JW</em>, he writes in the margin, drawing a neat arrow to the second floor drawing. <em>Suite for GS + elevator</em>.<br><br> \u201cYou absolutely do not know my initials, you are making that up,\u201d Stiles frowns, staring at the offensive evidence clearly in front of his face.<br><br> \u201cDon\u2019t make me say it,\u201d Derek warns threateningly, \u201cI\u2019m not entirely sure I even know how to, but I will make certain that my butchered pronunciation makes your head explode.\u201d<br><br> There\u2019s a funny little thump in his stomach, something echoing down from his ribs and bouncing through his torso, something that feels like an odd mixture of pleasure, pride, and fondness. He feels like a proud parent watching his delinquent child bring home his first passing report card, not quite straight-As but solid points for effort.<br><br> \u201cYou\u2019ll never know,\u201d he insists firmly, stamping down on the warm feeling. \u201cThe point, Derek,\u201d and while he doesn\u2019t let his voice get too somber, he lets enough of the teasing fade out so they can be clear on this, \u201cis that you have a pack. Your pack didn\u2019t abandon you, doesn\u2019t want to. In fact, your pack has actually gotten bigger since the last time you saw it, so you really might want to consider that third floor. It\u2019ll be a nice summer project, I can supervise while all you of the werewolfy super-strength run around shirtless.\u201d<br><br> Stiles drops one hand on Derek\u2019s knee, squeezing it briefly before using it to push himself upright, straight off the staircase until he\u2019s standing in front of Derek again. This time the man is looking up at Stiles, something that looks alarmingly, adorably, like a combination of confusion and hope settling across his features.<br><br> \u201cThe whole pack, significant others included, is going to be at my house tomorrow night. We\u2019re having a movie night, pack bonding, trying to see if everyone can actually coexist in the same room for a whole evening,\u201d Stiles shoves his hands in his pockets before he can do something ridiculous like ruffle Derek\u2019s hair or pat his cheek. \u201cIf you think you\u2019re ready for it, the invitation is open to you too. If not,\u201d he shrugs, \u201cwell, no one\u2019s going anywhere, we can wait a bit longer. Although I\u2019m not actually sure how Boyd escaped the Alphas, so that situation might change. Oh well. No immediate crises.\u201d<br><br> He doesn\u2019t bother waiting for a response from Derek, not really expecting one, so Stiles is already a few steps away when Derek calls out after him.<br><br> \u201cAren\u2019t you a little confused about which pack you\u2019re in?\u201d<br><br> In an earlier time he might have been offended, might have read thinly-veiled rejection and exclusion in the question. Stiles has spent too much time with Erica and Isaac this week, too many too emotional conversations about <em>feelings</em> and pack loyalty, to take it as anything other than Derek scrambling to understand. He turns back slowly, maintaining the distance between them but forcing himself to look the werewolf so squarely in the eye that Derek can\u2019t mistake it.<br><br> \u201cI\u2019m loyal to my Alpha,\u201d Stiles says firmly. \u201cAlways will be.\u201d</p>\n<p><em><br></em><br> It\u2019s\u2026it\u2019s not awkward, not really, but only because they all actively work at making it not awkward. Still, they\u2019re all <em>there</em>, even Scott, though he looks the most reluctant out of everyone, so it\u2019s a start. Stiles spent the better part of the day making food \u2013 Erica bounced frenetically back and forth between helping him and hovering over Boyd \u2013 mostly picky finger food they could pile onto the coffee table and eat in the living room, chili for nachos and homemade pigs in a blanket like his mom used to make every Superbowl Sunday. In an entirely non-shocking move the majority of the food is completely demolished within the first twenty minutes, but Stiles is convinced that\u2019s a good thing. Everyone\u2019s warm and slightly lethargic with the weight of too much junk food in their bellies, and the bloated contentment makes it that much easier to brush off the fact that two weeks ago most of them hated each other.<br><br> The movies help too; Stiles and Erica exchange entirely-too-pleased smirks the first time Jackson makes a snide comment about how painfully inaccurate Michael J. Fox\u2019s werewolf is.<br><br> \u201cAt least,\u201d Isaac amends, grimacing, \u201cit\u2019s not <em>Twilight</em>.\u201d<br><br> \u201cDon\u2019t lie, Isaac,\u201d Boyd grumbles back, \u201cyou\u2019re totally Team Jacob and we all know it.\u201d<br><br> \u201cWell yeah,\u201d Danny snorts, \u201chave you <em>seen </em>his abs?\u201d<br><br> But it\u2019s Scott, <em>Scott</em>, who seals the deal when he tentatively tosses out. \u201cWho needs Taylor Lautner when you have Derek Hale.\u201d<br><br> Danny is the first to laugh, but Isaac and Stiles follow so quickly after it\u2019s nearly simultaneous. Even ever-stoic Boyd cracks a smile at that, warily shaking his head.<br><br> \u201cGuys,\u201d Jackson pouts, and it takes Stiles a second to realize <em>holy shit</em>, Jackson\u2019s actually joking, actually playing petulant for laughs and not because he\u2019s being a spoiled brat, \u201cI\u2019m hurt. At the first opportunity possible I\u2019m challenging Derek to an ab-off.\u201d<br><br> \u201cErica and I volunteer to judge,\u201d Lydia says quickly. She twists around from her perch on Jackson\u2019s lap and hikes his shirt up to his ribs, studying his stomach like she isn\u2019t intimately familiar with it. \u201cErica?\u201d<br><br> \u201cI think,\u201d Erica hums after a moment of staring contemplatively at the proffered skin, \u201ca side-by-side comparison is in order. Also possibly a touch-test.\u201d<br><br> \u201cYou keep your greedy paws to yourself,\u201d Stiles chides, elbowing her in the ribs. Erica shifts her arm around enough to pinch Stiles\u2019 side in retaliation, grimacing apologetically when she accidentally catches Danny\u2019s skin too.<br><br> \u201cThat,\u201d Scott accuses melodramatically, \u201cthat is your possessive!Stiles face.\u201d<br><br> \u201cWhy do you sound surprised?\u201d Isaac nudges him, raising an eyebrow at Scott. \u201cIs it a secret that Stiles wants to lick every inch of Derek\u2019s six pack?\u201d<br><br> \u201cYou say that like I\u2019m the only one here,\u201d Stiles sighs, frowning at Isaac, \u201cwhen really, I mean, a show of hands \u2013\u201d<br><br> Erica, Lydia, Danny, and\u2026<em>Jackson</em>?...almost simultaneously raised their hands with more enthusiasm than Stiles had ever seen from any of them in a classroom. Stiles nods triumphantly, case in point, and grins at Isaac, who only shakes his head in response. They\u2019re joking, Stiles knows, but there\u2019s a feeling in the pit of his stomach that Isaac planted that particular idea on purpose. To <em>what</em> point and purpose Stiles isn\u2019t sure, but\u2026well, he\u2019s been fixated on worse thoughts before, so he\u2019ll allow it.<br><br> Because the important part, the real thing, is that this is <em>working</em>. It\u2019s not entirely effortless \u2013 there\u2019s a precarious sort of fragility in the air, like everything\u2019s okay now but one wrong word, one poorly-executed joke could bring it all crashing down around them \u2013 but it\u2019s something. Stiles is okay with something.<br><br> Erica, like she can hear Stiles\u2019 thoughts, or maybe just like she can smell the smug contentment on him, reaches over and laces their fingers together, squeezing his hand lightly. Stiles thinks maybe he likes this part most of all \u2013 the easy way everyone\u2019s all threaded together, Erica curled with her legs in Boyd\u2019s lap and her back against Stiles\u2019 side, Danny\u2019s thigh pressed against Stiles\u2019 from hip to knee. Jackson and Lydia have somehow squished themselves into Stiles\u2019 dad\u2019s recliner, Isaac and Scott are close enough on the loveseat that you could almost call it <em>cuddling</em> (and really, that\u2019s another avenue Stiles might have to explore with Isaac a bit, because there\u2019s pack-cuddling and then there\u2019s <em>cuddling</em> and Stiles is not entirely opposed to the idea of Isaac and Scott <em>cuddling</em> cudding). It\u2019s warm, and it\u2019s comfortable, and it\u2019s this, more than anything else, that makes Stiles think they have a chance at actually making this work long term.<br><br> They\u2019re halfway through <em>Van Helsing</em> when Erica\u2019s grip on Stiles\u2019 hand tightens. He\u2019d write it off as nothing, or maybe her distaste at the simpering vampire-girls on the screen, if it wasn\u2019t almost simultaneous with Boyd\u2019s suddenly tense shoulders and Isaac subtly freezing in place.<br><br> \u201cHe\u2019s outside. Front stoop.\u201d Erica presses the words against the shell of Stiles\u2019 ear, like five-eighths of the room isn\u2019t hyperaware already. They seem content to let Stiles handle it though, pointedly ignoring the way he leisurely pushes himself to his feet and heads towards the front door.<br><br> Derek looks fragile, like something that was shattered and then pieced back together, but the glue hasn\u2019t dried yet, the cautious hold tenuous at best. Stiles wants to blame it on the sallow glow of the overhead porch light, but he\u2019s so damn tired of lying to himself.<br><br> \u201cYou meant me,\u201d Derek doesn\u2019t hesitate, jumps right in the second Stiles pulls the door shut behind him, like he knows he\u2019ll lose his nerve if he waits too long, \u201cnot Scott.\u201d \u00a0<br><br> It\u2019s endearing, and exasperating, the way he tries so hard to make it sound insistent. Stiles hears the question too easily though, hears the hesitation and the uncertainty in Derek\u2019s voice, and wonders how long Derek\u2019s been broken. How long, really, and if he\u2019s so irreparably damaged that there\u2019s no hope for him, that nothing in the world will convince Derek that he has Stiles. But, then again, it\u2019s only in that moment, only as the thought formally crosses Stiles\u2019 mind for the first time that he\u2019s willing to acknowledge, that Stiles realizes exactly how true it is. Derek <em>has </em>him.<br><br> \u201cJesus, Derek,\u201d he exhales softly, \u201cit really is like the blind leading the blind with you, isn\u2019t it?\u201d<br><br> Derek flinches but holds his ground, like he\u2019s bracing himself for the verbal barrage he\u2019s so sure is coming, and Stiles <em>hates </em>it.<br><br> \u201cThe thing is,\u201d he pushes on, not letting Derek\u2019s hangdog look slow him down, \u201cit\u2019s so obvious to anyone who really looks at it that you tried. You took these kids, broken kids from broken lives and broken homes, and you gave all of us the chance to have something better, something really good. And yeah, dude, I\u2019m not gonna sugar-coat it \u2013 you sucked at it. You sucked really fucking bad at it, but the thing is, families? They kind of\u2026they forgive you for sucking, sometimes. Sometimes you get a couple redos before you get kicked to the curb and replaced by some serial killer, risen-from-the-grave uncle or a snot-nosed high school punk who\u2019s been a werewolf for less than a hot second.\u201d<br><br> There isn\u2019t really a smile on Derek\u2019s face (and lets face it, Stiles would fall ass-over-tits backwards off the stoop\u2019s railing if Derek actually <em>smiled</em> at him), but there\u2019s something that makes him look a little less dead around the eyes, something just a touch softer in the set of his shoulders, and Stiles really considers that as much of a victory as he\u2019s going to get. Derek doesn\u2019t look like he\u2019s quite ready for speech, not yet, but Stiles is content to wait for him, content to sit on his little perch and let Sourwolf McGee sort through it all for a few minutes.<br><br> \u201cSo\u2026\u201d Derek trails off, visibly weighing the pros and cons of saying whatever\u2019s hanging off the tip of his tongue.<br><br> Stiles heaves a long-suffering sigh, raising an eyebrow at the werewolf. \u201cThis may honestly be the only time I ever offer you a completely free pass to ask whatever you want, with absolutely no repercussions,\u201d he lies, because Derek so rarely opens himself up to other people\u2019s thoughts that Stiles knows he will never, ever deny him the opportunity. \u201cSpeak now, or forever hold you insane curiosity.\u201d<br><br> \u201cOn a scale of groveling to purchasing many, many expensive presents, how bad is it in there?\u201d Derek tries, and it\u2019s precious the way he thinks he\u2019s getting the harder question out of the way first.<br><br> \u201cScott and Lydia will require some extensive ass-kissing,\u201d Stiles ticks them off on his fingers, \u201cJackson will throw a fake temper-tantrum and will promptly get over it as soon as you start paying attention to him. Erica and Boyd need to be reassured that you won\u2019t kill them for leaving, so they won\u2019t be too bad. Isaac just wants everyone to be one big happy family, so sell Scott on joining the club and you\u2019ll kill two birds with one stone. And Danny\u2026\u201d Stiles smirked, reaching up to hook one finger in the hem of Derek\u2019s t-shirt, hiking it up to reveal the aforementioned abs. \u201cI\u2019m 85% positive Danny\u2019s the founder of a Facebook fan page dedicated entirely to these right here, so you\u2019re all set with him.\u201d<br><br> The corner of Derek\u2019s lip looks lighter still, not quite a smile yet but not <em>as </em>heavy as it had been. He shifts forward slightly, just enough to be feasibly passed off as him redistributing his weight, but Stiles can\u2019t help but notice it brings Derek closer, presses Stiles\u2019 hand just a touch firmer into warm skin.<br><br> \u201cWhat about you?\u201d the Alpha asks quietly, and Stiles genuinely has to restrain himself from pinching Derek\u2019s stomach as hard as he can possibly manage, because really, does he have to spell it out?<br><br> Yes. Apparently. He does.<br><br> (Never mind he himself is only just starting to grasp it, only just starting to understand. Erica knew. Isaac knew. Even Scott knew, a little bit. Derek should just <em>know</em>.)<br><br> \u201c<em>Derek</em>,\u201d Stiles groans, sliding his fingers down to hook into the belt loops of the werewolf\u2019s jeans, tugging him forward into the space between Stiles\u2019 thighs, pinning his hips in place with a gentle press of younger teen\u2019s knees. \u201cYou <em>have</em> me. You\u2019ve <em>always</em> had me, you absolute moron, how many physically impossible feats of life-saving heroics do I have to perform before you get it?\u201d<br><br> \u201cJus \u2013 just so we\u2019re clear on this,\u201d Derek mumbles, looking down to where Stiles still has his hands, both of them now, hooked into his belt loops, \u201cby have, you mean \u2013\u201d<br><br> Stiles cuts him off with a frustrated growl, yanking hard enough that Derek, in his surprise, stumbles forward, overbalancing enough to grab at the railing right next to Stiles\u2019 hip and bring his face close enough that Stiles can reach up, reeling Derek in with a hand on his jaw and a smirk on his lips.<br><br> If he\u2019d been forced to guess how this would go, because in the very, very deep back recesses of his subconscious Stiles <em>had</em> considered this as a possible outcome of their endless pigtail-pulling, he would have probably assumed violent and aggressive, tension snapping mid-argument like a rubber band to the face.<br><br> The kiss is soft, tentative, bordering on chaste. It\u2019s only just long enough to be real, just definitive enough to be clear in its intentions. This is a <em>kiss</em>, and Stiles licks across Derek\u2019s bottom lip before claiming the same spot with his teeth because he wants to be absolutely sure Derek can\u2019t mistake this as anything else.<br><br> He breaks it off first, pulling back far enough that he can meet the werewolf\u2019s stare without going cross-eyed but leaves his fingers firm against the rough stubble lining Derek\u2019s jaw. It\u2019s\u2026he takes the moment to collect himself, allows Derek the chance to catch up while Stiles own brain is firmly slotting everything into place with a quiet sort of <em>oh</em>. It\u2019s a sigh of relief and a surprised sort of wonder, that moment of soul-deep contentment when you twist the focus just right and suddenly everything\u2019s in vivid, technicolor clarity.<br><br> \u201cTraditionally,\u201d Derek mumbles, and it\u2019s only then that Stiles realizes the hand not bracing Derek against the railing has found its way to the short fuzz of hair on the nape of Stiles\u2019 neck, \u201cthere\u2019s a very specific position in the pack for someone like you.\u201d<br><br> He opens his eyes, and Stiles is pleasantly surprised to see they\u2019re completely void of any sign of alpha red. It\u2019s better than he\u2019d hoped for, really, because it means these words are Derek\u2019s, not influenced by any wolfy instinct or Alpha politics, but genuinely <em>Derek\u2019s</em>.<br><br> \u201cYeah,\u201d Stiles nods, smirking up just a little bit into Derek\u2019s heavy stare. \u201cYeah, I know.\u201d<br><br> Derek shifts his weight foot to foot, pressing lightly into Stiles\u2019 inner thighs and looking for all the world like Stiles has once again pulled the rug from under his feet, like Derek had had every intention of playing it down until Stiles had confirmed the futility of that effort.<br><br> Stiles resists the urge to laugh in his face. \u201cI\u2019m not saying we should go shopping for engagement rings yet,\u201d (the battle to control himself is quickly becoming a lost cause; Stiles stifles a giggle into the older man\u2019s shoulder when his face pales) \u201cme being, you know, sixteen-year-old jailbait and all. Maybe I\u2019m just saying that you don\u2019t have to do this alone.\u201d<br><br> Derek\u2019s panic softens considerably, the pads of his fingers pressing into the muscle of Stiles\u2019 neck until the teen pulls back enough to meet his eyes again.<br><br> \u201cYeah,\u201d the Alpha says quietly, stroking his thumb down the line Stiles\u2019 throat, \u201cI\u2019m starting to realize that.\u201d<br><br> Stiles lets the moment hang, closing his eyes and soaking in the feeling of Derek\u2019s thumb against the bumps and ridges and pale skin. He\u2019s not sure he\u2019s ever been so aware of another person\u2019s presence, has been able to close his eyes and hear as Derek\u2019s breathing quietly evens out, feel the ragged edge of a hangnail on Derek\u2019s thumb, taste the foreign flavor still lingering on his bottom lip.<br><br> \u201cSo,\u201d he clears his throat softly, opening his eyes to glance back up at Derek. \u201cI\u2019ve got a living room full of Betas and in-the-know humans that are eagerly looking forward to convincing you and Jackson to stand side by side with your shirts off.\u201d<br><br> Derek looks like he\u2019s not sure if Stiles is kidding or not, and the confusion is so painfully endearing that Stiles is genuinely baffled that he didn\u2019t clue in on himself a little sooner. He takes pity on the Alpha, slipping his fingers from Derek\u2019s belt loop to pinch the skin just above his waistband.<br><br> \u201cI\u2019m delighted to say I\u2019m being completely serious about that. But for real, they\u2019re desperately in need of an Alpha. So. You ready?\u201d<br><br> Derek nods. And then, like one nod isn\u2019t enough for him, he licks his lips and nods again. \u201cYeah,\u201d he agrees. \u201cYeah.\u201d<br><br> Stiles doesn\u2019t bother with any kind of pomp and circumstance, nor does he bother trying to hide anything from the group of teens blatantly, <em>painfully</em> trying to pretend like they hadn\u2019t just eavesdropped on the entire conversation. He leads Derek inside with loose fingers curled around the werewolf\u2019s wrist, and he\u2019s intrigued, but not entirely surprised, to notice that Danny has abandoned his place on the couch and resettled on the floor at Jackson\u2019s feet, shoulders tucked between his best friend\u2019s calves. Stiles heads for the couch and, after a lightning-fast eyes-and-eyebrows conversation with Erica, drops down in the space next to the arm, leaving a wide open cushion between himself and Erica.<br><br> Erica smiles tentatively at Derek, and while he doesn\u2019t quite smile back, something in his expression must signal his forgiveness, because a bone-deep tension rushes out of Erica like she\u2019s been holding it taut there for days. Derek settles an arm around her shoulders as she leans into him, and he uses the same hand to brush fondly over Boyd\u2019s head.<br><br> There\u2019ll be a conversation. There still needs to be, that much is clear. Not just Boyd and Erica; Jackson\u2019s already shooting attention-starved stares Derek\u2019s way, and some of the reluctance has returned to Scott\u2019s expression. But they let it settle in the background for now, something that can be dealt with later, separately, sometime outside of this temporary truce.<br><br> \u201cThe important question,\u201d Lydia says cautiously, and Stiles has never loved her more, \u201cis whether or not vampires are real too.\u201d<br><br> \u201cNo,\u201d Isaac shakes his head, \u201cthe important question is whether or not they\u2019re the Edward Cullen variety or the Count Dracula variety.\u201d<br><br> \u201cYou versus Edward Cullen,\u201d Danny challenges, \u201chand to hand combat. Who would win?\u201d<br><br> \u201cJacob,\u201d Boyd deadpans.<br><br> Laughter erupts around them, and just like that they\u2019re back where they were, Derek\u2019s arrival a forgotten interruption as Isaac loudly protests and Scott teases back.<br><br> On the couch cushion, in the scant space between Stiles\u2019 propped up foot and Derek\u2019s thigh, warm fingers find his hand and thread together with his own. Stiles squeezes Derek\u2019s hand in response, shifting his weight just enough that their shoulders press together.<br><br> It\u2019s not perfect. It\u2019s not fixed, just like that. It\u2019s still dangerous, still fragile. There are still loose ends \u2013 Allison isn\u2019t gone for good, and Peter\u2019s coming back too. Gerard\u2019s body hasn\u2019t been found, and Stiles already learned that lesson once this week. The Alpha pack is coming. But still, it\u2019s something. It\u2019s a start.<br><br> Stiles, slowly, exhales.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em>i carry your heart (i carry it in my heart)<br><br><br><br><br></em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<br></em>\n<a href=\"https://thegloryof.tumblr.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">tumblr</a>\n</p>"
