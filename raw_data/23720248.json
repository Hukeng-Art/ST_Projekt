  "notes": "<p>Hi guys! This fic is set shortly after the events of the Sunshot Campaign, but as if Wen Qing never met Wei Wuxian at Jinlintai (episode 26-ish for the live action people), thus triggering the events of Qiongqi Way/Path onward \u2014 the Wen siblings and A-Yuan are hiding safe and happy somewhere in this universe, thank you v much.

  "text": "<p>The whole unfortunate ordeal starts out with a night hunt, as most unfortunate things in Wei Wuxian\u2019s life regularly do.</p>\n<p>He and Lan Wangji had been part of a small hunting party in response to some complaints near Caiyi Town of graves being ravaged and upturned. The whole situation was pretty unbecoming, with half-decaying limbs being dragged out of the ground here and there, and the locals were starting to complain about the smell, among other things.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian certainly isn\u2019t in Gusu for his health, nor for any night hunts that the GusuLan sect could easily take care of themselves. No, he\u2019d found himself in Gusu with Jiang Cheng and shijie, mostly against his will, for a conference at the Cloud Recesses later in the week, where sect leaders and some select disciples would discuss next steps in the wake of the Sunshot Campaign \u2014 and the power vacuum left by the QishanWen sect\u2019s fall from grace.\u00a0</p>\n<p>All fine, and good. Wei Wuxian isn\u2019t exactly thrilled to be back in the Cloud Recesses, save for the liquor selection, but he far prefers it to Nightless City.</p>\n<p>The corpse-disturber, or whatever it is, was surely nothing that a small group of cultivators couldn\u2019t handle, which is why he, Lan Wangji, Jiang Cheng, and a few others had been deployed to solve the issue.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, the day\u2019s hunting party included Jin Zixuan, who was steadily tempting Wei Wuxian into committing homicide.</p>\n<p>After seeing the seventh snappy flip of hair over a bow and arrow, Wei Wuxian had decided he\u2019d had quite enough of that, thank you, and had roped a reluctant Lan Wangji into splitting off from the rest of the group to follow a separate trail of tracks, leading south while the rest of the party headed west.</p>\n<p>Which is how the two of them had ended up alone in a small, dank-smelling cave, currently struck dumb by an ear-splitting screech and an explosive flash of light.</p>\n<p>It takes several moments for Wei Wuxian to come back to himself; he blinks hard, but the darkness of the cave doesn\u2019t abate even a little bit, other than the searing white dots flickering in his vision. His ears are still ringing.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The cave is silent now, aside from their own mingled breathing \u2014 the creature, whatever it is, had been effectively spooked off.</p>\n<p>Fine, maybe this hadn\u2019t been one of Wei Wuxian\u2019s brighter ideas, as Lan Wangji had been so fond of reminding him every step of the way here. Not in words, of course, so much as judgy mannerisms and withering squinting.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cLan Zhan?\u201d he asks, panting and groping around in the dark. He finds a wiry shoulder under his palm a moment later. \u201cLan Zhan.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMn,\u201d Lan Wangji replies, and something sounds \u2014 different about his voice. Off. Wei Wuxian doesn\u2019t think much further on it.</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you okay? Ugh, it\u2019s so dark that I can barely breathe. Here.\u201d He sinks his teeth into his thumb, wincing at the sting as he draws blood, and traces a lighting talisman into the space in front of him.</p>\n<p>A gout of orange light flares around them, illuminating Lan Wangji\u2019s tired face before his and it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s \u2014 gray eyes gazing back at him, caught silver in the talisman\u2019s glow, and Wei Wuxian has one stunned, uncomprehending moment to take in his own features gazing back at him before he shouts, and the light snuffs out.</p>\n<p>\u201cWei Ying,\u201d Lan Wangji\u2019s voice \u2014 <em> Wei Wuxian\u2019s voice \u2014 </em>rings out in the dark, and he sounds panicked in a way that Wei Wuxian can\u2019t ever recall hearing from him. \u201cMy core, it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s \u2014\u201d He can\u2019t finish his sentence, the words choking off, and Wei Wuxian feels every drop of blood in his body ice over.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d he says, weakly, \u201cabout that,\u201d and then conveniently passes out.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u2014</p>\n<p>When Wei Wuxian comes to, it\u2019s to the uneven stagger of footsteps beneath him, and he squirms. There\u2019s a sharp huff of effort directly above him, and when he opens his eyes, bleary, he sees his own jawline above him, jutted in concentration. He\u2019s being carried \u2014 with considerable strain, given the new size difference \u2014 and Wei Wuxian struggles harder as he grips his bearings.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cLan Zhan,\u201d he says, \u201cwhat are you \u2014 put me down.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji doesn\u2019t answer him, just stubbornly keeps walking without looking down at him, and Wei Wuxian can\u2019t tell if he\u2019s unspeakably angry or just pigheaded.</p>\n<p>\u201cPlease,\u201d he adds. \u201cLan Zhan, what happened?\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji stops, then sets Wei Wuxian gently on his feet. The change in elevation makes all the blood rush to Wei Wuxian\u2019s head, and he sits with a heavy thud on the ground.</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian looks around, trying to reorient himself. It seems they\u2019re still some way from the entrance to Cloud Recesses, but still, Lan Wangji had carried him an impressive distance, given he\u2019s bleeding from a head wound and shaking with fatigue.</p>\n<p>Trembling, Wei Wuxian stares at his hands. The fingers are long, beautiful, moon-pale \u2014 nothing like his own worn, sun-browned hands. They carry the delicate elegance of a seasoned guqin player and the weathered strength of a practiced swordsman.</p>\n<p>They\u2019re Lan Wangji\u2019s hands. Wei Wuxian would know them anywhere. This is Lan Wangji\u2019s body.</p>\n<p>Apparently seeing his own body before him hadn\u2019t been sufficient for the reality of the situation to set in. <em> Now, </em>he\u2019s beginning to fully panic.</p>\n<p>\u201cLan Zhan,\u201d he says in a strangled voice, patting down his chest (broader than his own), his arms (much stronger than his own), his waist\u2014</p>\n<p>\u201cStop that,\u201d Lan Wangji says in a similar tone, and Wei Wuxian looks up at him; his fists are clenched, his lips pressed into a thin white line.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat the <em> hell </em>happened?\u201d Wei Wuxian asks, shriller than anything befitting Lan Wangji\u2019s low voice.</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Lan Wangji says tightly.</p>\n<p>\u201cHow do we fix it?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Lan Wangji closes his eyes, seeming as though he\u2019s wading through some implacable emotion, before he says, \u201cWei Ying.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYour golden core.\u201d A slight tremor shakes the composure in Lan Wangji\u2019s voice. He closes his eyes, as though pained. \u201cIt\u2019s\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou can\u2019t tell <em> anyone,</em>\u201d Wei Wuxian says, and Lan Wangji\u2019s eyes fly open. \u201cYou have to swear to me, Lan Zhan, that no one can know.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cKnow what?\u201d Lan Wangji whispers. He's still shaking a little; carrying Wei Wuxian all that way must have really sapped his strength.</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian falls silent.</p>\n<p>\u201cWei Ying,\u201d Lan Wangji says, much harsher.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s gone,\u201d Wei Wuxian says, and he feels a hard knot slide up his throat. He swallows around it with difficulty. \u201cI gave it up.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji takes a stumbling half-step back, like he\u2019s been dealt an unexpected blow.</p>\n<p>\u201cWho did this,\u201d he says then. His voice is clipped, quiet, dangerous. He\u2019s definitely shaking now, more than before, his expression one Wei Wuxian has never seen. It\u2019s murderous. His fists are clenched at his sides. He asks again through his teeth: \u201cWho.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIt was my choice.\" Wei Wuxian is suddenly unable to look Lan Wangji in the eye. He knots his fingers in the grass, roping it around and around his knuckles until the circulation cuts off.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy,\u201d Lan Wangji says, faintly. \u201c<em>How.</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBecause Jiang Cheng lost his,\u201d Wei Wuxian says. \u201cHe\u2019s sect leader now, and \u2014 and I had a perfectly healthy core. It wasn\u2019t even a question.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji makes this quiet noise like he\u2019s been punched.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian swallows the unpleasant emotion welling up in him, fast and thick. \u201cHe can\u2019t ever know,\u201d he says. \u201cLan Zhan, please, I\u2019m begging you \u2014 please keep it between us.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Lan Wangji starts, and then is evidently unable to finish whatever he wants to say, because he cuts himself off, goes silent again.\u00a0</p>\n<p>It\u2019s too intense. Too serious. Too much. With all his effort, Wei Wuxian summons up a thin smile, dons his bravado like armor again. \u201cAh, Lan Zhan, it\u2019s all fine, really. What did the son of a servant need with all that anyway? Much more fitting that Jiang Cheng has it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWei Ying,\u201d Lan Wangji whispers.</p>\n<p>\u201cEnough, enough.\u201d Wei Wuxian\u2019s skin is starting to prickle; he can\u2019t take Lan Wangji\u2019s scolding if that\u2019s what he\u2019s going to do, not on this. Not about this. \u201cLet\u2019s not speak of it, okay? Let\u2019s figure out what we\u2019re going to do. I\u2026I realize this predicament leaves you powerless now, huh? It\u2019s okay, I can teach you some talismans on the most basic things. That way you can protect yourself, just until this situation sorts out.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji is still faced away from him, his chin angled in the direction of Cloud Recesses, Wei Wuxian\u2019s crimson hair ribbon flapping in the wind behind him. Is he angry? Wei Wuxian can\u2019t tell. He\u2019s probably angry \u2014 a golden core transfer is certainly not orthodox.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThank you for carrying me out of there,\u201d Wei Wuxian begins.</p>\n<p>\u201cDo not thank me,\u201d Lan Wangji says at once. So, definitely angry then.</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian goes quiet again, uncertain of what to say in the uncomfortable silence that follows. He tries for levity.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cConsider yourself blessed, Lan Zhan! You\u2019re now <em> much </em>more handsome than you were before,\u201d he says with a forced laugh, and makes a face when he\u2019s stonewalled with Lan Wangji\u2019s cool silence. \u201cFine, fine, I know I got the better end of the deal here. Who wouldn\u2019t want to be the beautiful, powerful Hanguang-Jun, shining Jade of Gusu and the cultivation world\u2019s most eligible bachelor \u2014\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWei Ying,\u201d Lan Wangji says again, tensely.</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay, okay, I\u2019ll stop teasing.\u201d For now.</p>\n<p>He rustles himself to his feet, tripping for a moment \u2014 Lan Wangji\u2019s robes are tighter than his, and his limbs are longer, his feet bigger. He\u2019s surprised to feel that Lan Wangji catches his elbow, propelling them both forward.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t so bad, Lan Zhan,\u201d he says as they start walking again. \u201cIt could even be fun. Think about it \u2014 when will this kind of thing ever happen to us again?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d says Lan Wangji, and that\u2019s all he says, but it shuts Wei Wuxian up, and they\u2019re silent the rest of the way.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u2014\u00a0</p>\n<p>It\u2019s still early afternoon when they finally get back to the Cloud Recesses. Lan Wangji immediately drags him to the <em> yashi </em>before anyone can catch sight of them, Wei Wuxian whining in protest the whole time. The rest of the hunting party must not be back yet, still out looking for the creature; the Cloud Recesses are even more silent and austere than usual.</p>\n<p>He waits around, bored and restless, while Lan Wangji tends to the head wound Wei Wuxian had managed to pick up before they\u2019d been cursed. Wei Wuxian watches as Lan Wangji gingerly dabs at the blood with a wet cloth until it\u2019s just a pink, shallow scratch; he watches him move around in his body for a few moments more, then finally has to look away. The whole thing is too strange and surreal, watching himself with Lan Wangji\u2019s mannerisms and tics.</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji\u2019s pristine white robes have been muddied with dirt and blood, but Wei Wuxian isn\u2019t sure offering to change them will go over well, given Lan Wangji\u2019s stormy expression as he attempts to clean his face.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Still, the headband is itchy and sticking to his forehead with sweat. How does Lan Zhan <em> stand </em>this all the time \u2014</p>\n<p>\u201cNo touching,\u201d Lan Wangji says sharply, seeing Wei Wuxian\u2019s intent \u2014 which, of course, means he <em> has </em>to touch it now.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d Wei Wuxian says, his lips creeping up in a mischievous grin. \u201cI <em> am </em> Hanguang-Jun, after all.\u201d He runs a thumb along the fine silk of the headband, smiling wider when Lan Wangji turns a dangerous shade of pink. \u201cWhat\u2019s so special about it, anyway\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cStop,\u201d Lan Wangji says in a low voice, a vein in his forehead starting to pulse. Wei Wuxian concedes, laughing and throwing his hands up in surrender.</p>\n<p>\u201cFine, fine. For you, dearest Lan Zhan, I\u2019ll stop.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cStand still,\u201d Lan Wangji orders, crossing to him, and Wei Wuxian gives a mock-serious nod and straightens his shoulders as tight as they\u2019ll go, holding his head aloft and adopting Lan Zhan\u2019s usual deadpan.</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian squirms in place as Lan Wangji considers him silently, his eyes trailing from head to toe. The metal of his ridiculous headpiece is digging painfully into his scalp, pinching the roots of his hair; he\u2019s sweating like a pig under all these layers, and all the dried sweat and blood from earlier is uncomfortable; his ribs itch from the undershirt stuck to his body \u2014\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cStand still,\u201d Lan Wangji says again, not harsh but stern, and Wei Wuxian stops fidgeting and starts sulking. \u201cTemper your expression.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian\u2019s lip had been edging toward an instinctive pout; he schools his expression, straightening his shoulders and fixing his features in a neutral, somewhat bored look. He hoods his eyes for extra effect.</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji, with Wei Wuxian\u2019s head, nods once in approval. \u201cGood.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo, what \u2014 I just have to not move at all, do nothing, and look like a corpse, and people will believe it\u2019s you?\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji gives him a look that Wei Wuxian thinks is supposed to be wry and doesn\u2019t deign to respond.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat about you?\u201d Wei Wuxian counters. \u201cNobody is going to believe it\u2019s me for a second if all you do is stand there, look imperious, and say <em> Mn.</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>Something fleets across Lan Wangji\u2019s (Wei Wuxian\u2019s?) face \u2014 embarrassment, maybe \u2014 before it passes just as quickly, and Lan Wangji returns to glaring at him.</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian feels a helpless grin steal over him again. He bounces forward into Lan Wangji\u2019s space, the becoming-Hanguang-Jun lesson forgotten at the prospect of merciless teasing.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat do you know about being shameless, Lan Zhan? Have you ever tried it?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian is perhaps a little too thrilled to see a low flush start at the base of Lan Wangji\u2019s neck. Lan Wangji\u2019s gaze cuts away, purposefully avoiding eye contact as he practically simmers with discomfort.</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian leans closer, and it\u2019s <em> strange </em>to be this close to his own face and features, to see them move independently in a manner that\u2019s nothing like he would recognize of himself.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d he hears himself saying, before he can stop himself. \u201cI can teach you. I\u2019m an expert on this topic.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji tenses further, his gaze fastened to some apparently fascinating speck of dust on the floor. \u201cNo need.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAh, Lan Zhan.\u201d Wei Wuxian\u2019s voice borders on a whine, which is both hilarious and surreal, hearing it in Lan Wangji\u2019s low baritone. \u201cMake this a little fun for me, will you? It\u2019s the least you can do, seeing I\u2019m stuck as the venerable Hanguang-Jun with all his boring, insufferable duties and rules for the foreseeable future.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji\u2019s expression doesn\u2019t change, but Wei Wuxian sees the bob of his throat as he swallows.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat would you\u2026have me do,\u201d he says quietly.</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian counts this as a small victory, and he feels a huge grin split his face. It feels different from smiling with his own \u2014 more wooden, less natural, like Lan Wangji\u2019s facial muscles aren\u2019t accustomed to the expression.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, first off, you can drink as much as you want to now,\u201d he says, and Lan Wangji starts to glare again. \u201cNo, really, I mean it! My body has the tolerance of a horse. Two horses, probably. You can tease Jiang Cheng as much as you want to \u2014 in fact, I\u2019d encourage you to, to fully sell the part. Pranks are good, breaking rules is good.\u201d He pauses. \u201cWhat do you know about flirting?\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji full-body flinches like he\u2019s been scalded. \u201cRidiculous,\u201d he snaps.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m just being thorough! Wei Wuxian is well-known among young cultivators as being a shameless flirt, and good at it,\u201d Wei Wuxian insists, ignoring the way Lan Wangji\u2019s starting to look like he swallowed something extremely sour. \u201cYou can practice on me, if you\u2019d like. Friend to friend.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji takes a step back, like he\u2019s unconsciously trying to flee.</p>\n<p>\u201cSee, that\u2019s exactly what you <em> won\u2019t </em>do,\u201d Wei Wuxian says disapprovingly. \u201cLan Zhan, you\u2019ve faced down vengeful spirits, fierce corpses, and a mythical, murderous turtle. What could possibly be so scary about this, eh? It\u2019s just talking.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2026do not know how to,\u201d Lan Wangji says, then looks furious at himself for the admission, his brows pulling together.</p>\n<p>\u201cSure you do. I\u2019ve been flirting with you for ages. Just copy what I\u2019ve been doing.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji\u2019s head snaps up. He stares at Wei Wuxian with a slapped expression. \u201cYou\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMe\u2026?\u201d Wei Wuxian prompts.</p>\n<p>The blush is crawling up steadily toward Lan Wangji\u2019s jaw. \u201cYou\u2026flirt. With me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian arches his eyebrows. \u201c\u2026yes? You can\u2019t mean that you haven\u2019t noticed.\u201d Subtlety is not one of his strong suits, as he\u2019s so endlessly been informed.</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji appears to visibly struggle with digesting this information. Finally, in a quieter voice, he says, \u201cWhy.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBecause it\u2019s fun,\u201d Wei Wuxian says with a shrug. \u201cYou\u2019re so easy to rile up. Your ears get all red; it\u2019s cute.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji's expression shifts \u2014 if Wei Wuxian didn't know better, he'd say he looks crestfallen. Abruptly, though, the expression shifts to a scowl, too quickly for Wei Wuxian to question anything else.</p>\n<p>\u201cLan Zhan ah, if you keep doing that with my face, it\u2019ll get stuck like that,\u201d Wei Wuxian chides.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis will not work,\u201d Lan Wangji mutters, more to himself than Wei Wuxian. \u201cXiongzhang will take one look and know the truth.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou underestimate my acting abilities,\u201d Wei Wuxian says, who thinks he\u2019s quite good at pretending to be things he\u2019s not, when there\u2019s suddenly a knock at the door. Both of them jump.</p>\n<p>\u201cA-Xian,\u201d shijie says at the door with a warm, dimpled smile, and Wei Wuxian says brightly, \u201cShijie!\u201d before remembering that\u2019s exactly what he\u2019s not supposed to do.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Shijie\u2019s gaze flits away from Lan Wangji to him, her brow creasing in confusion.</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2026Wei Ying\u2019s shijie,\u201d he scrambles to recover. \u201cWei Ying, your shijie is here.\u201d</p>\n<p>Shijie still looks puzzled, possibly at the prospect of Hanguang-Jun speaking more words to her than he collectively ever has, but she sets the pot of soup on the ground to salute him. \u201cLan er-gongzi.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian remembers himself; he salutes back, keeping his back stiff and his features as neutral as Lan Wangji would. \u201cJiang-guniang.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cA-Xian, I thought I\u2019d find you here,\u201d shijie says, turning back to Lan Wangji, who\u2019s starting to look like ants are crawling up his spine. \u201cThe hunting party returned and they asked after you. They haven\u2019t located the creature yet, but everyone said you did well today.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHe did,\u201d Wei Wuxian says, crossing his arms proudly, and Lan Wangji shoots him a Look.</p>\n<p>\u201cAh\u2026yes,\u201d Lan Wangji says, and just the two words alone are enough to sound the alarm bells in Wei Wuxian\u2019s head. He watches, with rising concern, as Lan Wangji attempts to make expressions with his face. \u201cYes, I performed\u2026admirably. I am certain that...several maidens would be impressed.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian covers his face with one hand.</p>\n<p>Shijie stares at him, faltering more uncertainly by the moment. \u201cA-Xian, are you feeling well? You look\u2026.\u201d She, understandably, can\u2019t seem to find a word to describe exactly how Lan Wangji looks, as Wei Wuxian doubts anyone would.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m fine, shijie,\u201d Lan Wangji says, more animated than before, and Wei Wuxian peeks out from between the slats of his fingers, surprised. \u201cYou brought pork ribs and lotus root soup?\u201d</p>\n<p>Shijie visibly relaxes; Wei Wuxian frowns. How does Lan Wangji know his favorite soup?</p>\n<p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t find lotus here in the Cloud Recesses,\u201d shijie admits, stooping to pick it up, \u201cbut I made the next best thing. I even added extra spice for my Xian-Xian.\u201d She reaches out to affectionately tweak his nose. Wei Wuxian watches as Lan Wangji physically struggles not to reel backward at the familiar touch.</p>\n<p>\u201cThank\u2026you,\u201d he says, and Wei Wuxian has to bite his lip to keep from jumping in.</p>\n<p>Usually, he and shijie would spend another several minutes talking and teasing, catching up, eating together. But Wei Wuxian is familiar with Lan Wangji\u2019s tolerance for spice \u2014 shijie will know immediately that something is amiss if he starts to gag on her soup.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cJiang-guniang,\u201d he says, quieting his voice in the way that Lan Wangji does, and Lan Wangji flares a look of disgruntled surprise in his direction. \u201cPlease forgive the imposition, but I need to discuss certain matters with Wei Ying in private.\u201d</p>\n<p>Shijie can hardly contain her surprise. She darts another glance back to her presumed brother, who is watching her with all of Lan Wangji\u2019s characteristic, face-melting intensity.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI, ah\u2014of course, Lan er-gongzi.\u201d She looks at Lan Wangji again, confusion clear in her face, before she says, \u201cI hope A-Xian will enjoy his soup, and that we\u2019ll talk later.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji nods once. \u201cYes. Of course.\u201d</p>\n<p>Shijie salutes Wei Wuxian one more time, and casts another searching glance at Lan Wangji, clearly trying to catch his eye to communicate something, but Lan Wangji keeps staring into his soup, his head down.</p>\n<p>The moment shijie leaves, Wei Wuxian says with a gusty sigh, \u201cWell, that could have gone better.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji surprises him, then \u2014 he tentatively sniffs at the soup, then takes a sip.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey!\u201d Wei Wuxian darts forward to snatch the bowl from him. \u201cThat\u2019s for me!\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji makes a slightly pained expression, then pauses to consider. Then he says, near-thoughtful, \u201cYour tastebuds have evidently become numb to extreme spice, after years of regular destruction.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Wei Wuxian says with a sniff, then takes a sip for himself. He immediately chokes and sucks in a breath, Lan Wangji\u2019s bland, virgin palate rebelling at the overwhelming burn of the spices, but he\u2019s determined to enjoy this one good thing left to him, in these circumstances, so he continues to eat, tears streaming down his cheeks.</p>\n<p>\u201cJiang-guniang,\u201d Lan Wangji says after another moment. He stares at the doorway, looking uncertain. \u201cShe knew. That something was wrong.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAh, it\u2019s fine. Shijie knows me better than anyone, so of course she would realize something is off,\u201d Wei Wuxian tells him, slurping down the soup noisily in a way that would surely make any member of the GusuLan sect keel over in shame. \u201cI don\u2019t expect you to know exactly how to be me, after all.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji pauses, then after a quiet moment, begins to speak, with a lilting hesitancy. \u201cYou\u2026have a furrow between your brows when you are focused, or cultivating.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHm?\u201d Wei Wuxian pauses in his soup-slurping.</p>\n<p>\u201cSometimes you stick your tongue out, too, when you concentrate,\u201d Lan Wangji says, still in that soft, reflective voice. \u201cWhen you laugh, you throw your head back; sometimes you clutch your own arms, or sides, when you cannot stop. You stroke your nose twice, when you are thoughtful or irritated. Your nose crinkles when you smile with all your teeth; you have a dimple on one side. You always push your hair out of your face, like you need to see things more clearly.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian stares at him, soup forgotten. That\u2019s more words than Lan Wangji has said to him in\u2026well, ever.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou notice a lot of things, huh?\u201d he says after a moment, recovering from his surprise. There\u2019s a weird flush of warmth in his belly that\u2019s surely from the spice of the soup.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cMn,\u201d Lan Wangji says. Then, like a punctuation mark, \u201cI do.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u2014</p>\n<p>An hour later, Wei Wuxian is napping, sprawled out on the steps of the <em> jingshi </em> to soak in some of the late afternoon sunlight, when he\u2019s rudely awoken by someone hitting his knee.</p>\n<p>He jolts into consciousness. \u201cAiyo!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSit up straight,\u201d Lan Wangji orders, and Wei Wuxian takes a few moments to blink, dizzy and disoriented, at his own angry face swimming before him. \u201cIf anyone were to see\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSee what?\u201d Wei Wuxian says petulantly, then looks down at himself. Lan Wangji\u2019s body is draped over the steps, his white-clad legs akimbo and spread, one knee cocked up on a different step than the other, his head resting on one of his hands.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou must meditate at least three times a day to maintain core and <em> yang </em> energy,\u201d Lan Wangji instructs. \u201cMy body, it\u2019s\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBuilt?\u201d Wei Wuxian suggests, running an interested hand over the sharp, lean cut of Lan Wangji\u2019s ribs, his hips. \u201cI must say I\u2019m impressed, Hanguang-Jun. No one would guess at all this muscle under all those stuffy, needless layers.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cStop at once,\u201d Lan Wangji grits out, and Wei Wuxian bursts into a loud, delighted peal of laughter to picture the image that\u2019s eliciting the horror mirrored back on his own face \u2014 the esteemed, pearl-white Hanguang-Jun, sprawled out in overly formal attire, still muddied and bloodied, feeling himself up in broad daylight.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m sorry,\u201d Wei Wuxian chuckles, clambering to his feet. \u201cBut learn to take a compliment, will you? You have nothing to be ashamed of. In fact, I \u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cEnough.\u201d Lan Wangji is turned profile to him now, staring off with a fixed, steely expression, a muscle in his jaw working. His ears are red. Wei Wuxian\u2019s never seen his own body blush before, obviously, so it interests him. \u201cThis is an unfortunate enough predicament without you\u2026you\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAren\u2019t you a <em> little </em>curious?\u201d Wei Wuxian teases, drawing closer. Lan Wangji takes a responding step backward. \u201cIt isn\u2019t every day you get to wake up in a body that\u2019s not your own. It\u2019s okay to have questions.\u201d</p>\n<p>The second the words leave his mouth, Wei Wuxian has an unbidden image of Lan Wangji touching Wei Wuxian\u2019s own body, running his hands over it the way he himself just had \u2014 undressing himself, staring in the mirror and \u2014 his mouth immediately dries out, heat buzzing through his head.</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji\u2019s lips are pinched with tension, his shoulders rigid at Wei Wuxian\u2019s implications. His fists are so tight that his knuckles whiten.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d he hisses, and that\u2019s all he says.</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay, okay,\u201d Wei Wuxian says, putting his hands up in concession. He\u2019s admittedly a little unbalanced by the very thought that\u2019s perhaps troubling Lan Wangji so much. \u201cI promise I\u2019ll behave. I won\u2019t take advantage of you, Lan Zhan, I swear. I wouldn\u2019t do that.\u201d</p>\n<p>His tone must be severe enough because Lan Wangji relaxes an increment, but not completely.</p>\n<p>\u201cBut you do have a nice body,\u201d he can\u2019t resist adding, all in one breath, and Lan Wangji says, near-spluttering, \u201cYou \u2014\u201d then nothing else.</p>\n<p>\u201cHere,\u201d Wei Wuxian says, \u201ccome here,\u201d and turns Lan Wangji by the shoulder. \u201cI haven\u2019t gotten to see my own face up close yet.\u201d He grabs Lan Wangji with one hand by the jaw as Lan Wangji startles backwards, and intensely peruses his own features as Lan Wangji struggles in his grip \u2014 but for once, he has the upper hand on physical strength and height, thanks to Lan Wangji\u2019s stature.</p>\n<p>\u201cHmm,\u201d he says, examining each feature while Lan Wangji freezes in his grip, mute with what Wei Wuxian can only assume is fury. \u201cAll of my features are backwards than how I usually see them. Ah, you know, I don\u2019t think I\u2019m as handsome as people say I am. At least, not anywhere as handsome as Hanguang-Jun.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHey!\u201d calls out a harsh, familiar voice, and both of them go very still. \u201cLan Wangji, what the hell do you think you\u2019re doing?!\u201d</p>\n<p>Realizing how the situation must appear to an outsider, Wei Wuxian lets go of Lan Wangji at once. They both turn.</p>\n<p>\u201cJiang Ch \u2014 Jiang-zongzhu,\u201d Wei Wuxian says hastily, with not even a scrap of Lan Wangji\u2019s usual composure. He salutes.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat the hell were you doing?\u201d Jiang Cheng demands, stalking over to them and casting a frank once-over to Lan Wangji. \u201cWei Wuxian, is he bothering you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d Lan Wangji says, honestly, and Wei Wuxian makes an affronted noise. \u201cNo. We were talking.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat looked very touchy for talking,\u201d Jiang Cheng says, and crosses his arms with a suspicious scowl to Wei Wuxian. \u201cI don\u2019t care if you\u2019re a precious Jade of Gusu, Hanguang-Jun, if you lay a hand on my brother\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s enough, Jiang Cheng. You look like a puffed-up grape when you make threats,\u201d Wei Wuxian says, and really, he has fraternal reflex to blame more for that than anything, but Lan Wangji makes a hissing sound through his teeth and Jiang Cheng\u2019s jaw drops open in comical shock.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat \u2014 what did you just say to me??\u201d he splutters, uncoiling his hand at once. Zidian crackles with a flash of electric purple. \u201cJust what are you trying to start, Lan Wangji?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWei Ying,\u201d Lan Wangji says with Wei Wuxian\u2019s mouth, and Jiang Cheng looks at him so fast his neck nearly cracks.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat the hell is going on?\u201d he shouts, and Wei Wuxian knows very well that firstly, Jiang Cheng is going to start whipping people, probably, until he gets a coherent answer, and secondly, it\u2019s going to make a public scene.</p>\n<p>\u201cJiang Cheng!\u201d he says, at the same moment that Lan Wangji says, firmly, \u201cJiang Wanyin, control yourself.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jiang Cheng\u2019s head whips back and forth between them like he\u2019s following a particularly zippy and irritating fly.</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t call me Jiang Cheng!\u201d he blusters, pointing an accusing finger at Wei Wuxian. \u201cLan Wangji, where\u2019s your sense of propriety?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhere\u2019s yours?\u201d Wei Wuxian returns. \u201cJiang Cheng, Jiang Wanyin \u2014 put Zidian away and let us explain, please?\u201d</p>\n<p>Jiang Cheng hesitates, clearly torn, before his confusion wins out, and then Zidian recoils, curling around his finger into its resting serpentine shape. \u201cTalk. Now.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo, the night hunt,\u201d Wei Wuxian begins, and Jiang Cheng turns to stare at him, visibly baffled to hear Lan Wangji speaking so informally \u2014 or at all, for that matter. \u201cThere was a\u2026small setback. Lan Zhan and I, we separated from the group because we had a lead \u2014 don\u2019t look at me like that, I would have brought you with us if I didn\u2019t know you would react like this \u2014 and the creature lured us into a cave; things got very loud and very bright all of a sudden, and when we woke up, everything was dark and the creature had vanished, and \u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI am in Wei Ying\u2019s body, he is in mine,\u201d Lan Wangji says, more succinctly than anything Wei Wuxian\u2019s continued rambling would offer.</p>\n<p>Jiang Cheng gapes at them for another moment before he turns to Wei Wuxian, wearing Lan Wangji\u2019s face, and says, \u201cYou deserve this.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHey!\u201d Wei Wuxian protests. \u201cWell, I mean. I\u2019m not complaining too much. Look how cute he is, no?\u201d He pinches Lan Wangji\u2019s dirtied sleeve and then winks at Lan Wangji, who\u2019s glowering at him and flushing to his roots.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOnly you could be so shameless wearing the skin of <em> Hanguang-Jun,</em>\u201d Jiang Cheng says through his teeth. \u201cThis is bad. Very bad. You do realize that the rest of the sect leaders are gathering here in three days\u2019 time? If that display just now was the best you\u2019ve got, they\u2019ll immediately know something is wrong. The GusuLan sect will have your head for defiling their most precious disciple with your demonic tricks.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHey,\u201d Wei Wuxian says again, much more weakly than before, because no, he hadn\u2019t considered that possibility, and yes, Jiang Cheng is absolutely right.</p>\n<p>\u201cWei Ying didn\u2019t do anything wrong,\u201d Lan Wangji cuts in, to Wei Wuxian\u2019s relief. \u201cIt was an honest mistake. I will see if the library can provide answers for how to switch back.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian groans at that and stretches. Lan Wangji\u2019s body is much suppler than his, given all his rigorous training and the abundant golden core energy flowing through him. When he gets back to his own body, he won\u2019t have that anymore.</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian viciously shoves the last thought down, and the sharp ache that accompanies it.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou can go to the boring library,\u201d Wei Wuxian tells Lan Wangji. \u201cI was thinking of going to Cold Spring.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Lan Wangji says, in such a frightful voice that it brings Wei Wuxian up short.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat? I\u2019m not trying to be inappropriate. You told me to meditate, and you\u2019re right \u2014 Cold Spring is the best place to do it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Lan Wangji repeats, and Wei Wuxian sulks at him.</p>\n<p>\u201cCan you stop thinking about getting undressed for two seconds?\u201d Jiang Cheng asks Wei Wuxian, exasperated. \u201cYou\u2019re an embarrassment.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t! Thinking about that, I mean\u2014\u201d Was he? He certainly is now. Wei Wuxian is shocked to find his ears are hot.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Hmm. Maybe not so shameless, after all.</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji, without so much as a by-your-leave, turns and stalks off toward the library, his black-clad shoulders a stiff line and his arms clasped behind his back.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHey, Lan Zhan!\u201d Wei Wuxian calls after him, disappointed, then bites out, <em> \u201cOw,</em>\u201d when Jiang Cheng elbows him hard in the ribs.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you? Can\u2019t you leave him alone?\u201d Jiang Cheng demands. \u201cThis situation is humiliating enough for him without your torturing him.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not torturing him,\u201d Wei Wuxian protests, wincing and rubbing the tender spot on his ribs.</p>\n<p>Jiang Cheng huffs. \u201cImagine being trapped in the body of the person you hate the most. No wonder he can\u2019t stand the sight of you, parading his body around and acting like that!\u201d</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian stares after Lan Wangji\u2019s receding form, a tightness lodging in his throat. He knows he\u2019s irritating, usually deliberately so, but does Lan Wangji still really dislike him so much? Even after everything?</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2014time to act like a fool about your giant crush on Lan Wangji,\u201d Wei Wuxian tunes back in to Jiang Cheng saying. \u201cHave a little decency, for my sake if not your own.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t \u2014 I don\u2019t have a \u2014\u201d Wei Wuxian stammers, unbalanced by this unexpected affront, and he grapples for words for the next few seconds while Jiang Cheng watches, his eyebrows creeping closer and closer to his hairline. Eventually, all Wei Wuxian can summon is, \u201cJiang Cheng, what are you saying?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Jiang Cheng rolls his eyes upward as though seeking answers from the heavens. \u201cCrush, infatuation, whatever it is. Just leave him alone until we get this sorted out.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t like him!\u201d Wei Wuxian protests, still stuck on this heinous accusation. \u201cI mean, I like him just fine, but a <em> crush, </em> I mean, he\u2019s\u2014he\u2019s so boring, and stuffy, and <em> mean.</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou like mean,\u201d Jiang Cheng points out.</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian has never felt so attacked in his short, painful life.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cBelieve me, I don\u2019t pretend to understand,\u201d Jiang Cheng says, with a properly nauseated expression. \u201cBut we\u2019re wasting time. Let\u2019s follow him to the library and look for answers.\u201d</p>\n<p>They walk together in uncharacteristic silence, and surely an odd sight they\u2019d make to any Lan disciples walking by\u2014the impervious, tall, reserved, dove-white Hanguang-Jun, still dirtied and bloodied from today\u2019s night hunt, side by side with the scowling and colorful Sandu Shengshou.</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian can\u2019t shake Jiang Cheng\u2019s words, even though they\u2019d clearly only been meant to nettle him. They shouldn\u2019t \u2014 Jiang Cheng has historically said far, far worse.</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian had, admittedly, been somewhat obsessed with Lan Zhan in his early days at Cloud Recesses. Fine. But it was only because he was entertained and fascinated by Lan Wangji\u2019s clear, unadorned hatred of him. As the weeks had gone on, it had turned into a fun challenge, or a particularly frustrating riddle, to try to get Lan Wangji to like him, to make him stammer and blush, to watch his gold eyes spark like molten metal when his temper flared.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian has long made a sport of being annoying, but so far, he\u2019s charmed his way out of every instance where exasperation toed the line of ill regard. There hasn\u2019t been anyone, as far as he\u2019s known, who has genuinely disliked him in spite of his best efforts. Except for Lan Wangji. (Well, and Madam Yu, but she doesn\u2019t count.)\u00a0</p>\n<p>It had been funny, at first, and then a private thrill to attempt to charm him, and Lan Wangji certainly isn\u2019t hard to look at. Wei Wuxian has always been unabashedly hedonistic, admiring beautiful things and beautiful people in all forms, and there is no finer specimen in the cultivation world than the jade-edged Hanguang-Jun.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Who could blame him if he <em> is </em> a little infatuated, after all?</p>\n<p>But Jiang Cheng is right. To Lan Wangji, Wei Wuxian knows he\u2019s brash, loud, crass, intolerable to his very idea of existence. Over time, the more experiences they\u2019d shared together, he\u2019d thought that maybe\u2026<em>maybe </em> he hadn\u2019t imagined the way he\u2019d caught Lan Wangji looking at him when he thought Wei Wuxian wasn\u2019t paying attention. But likely, he realizes, it had been wishful thinking, because he wants Lan Wangji to like him. He really does.</p>\n<p>He wants Lan Wangji to <em> really </em>like him.</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you listening to me, Wei Wuxian?\u201d Jiang Cheng snaps, and Wei Wuxian comes back to himself, blinking. They\u2019re in front of the Library Pavilion now, and Jiang Cheng is scowling at him.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he says, succinctly.</p>\n<p>\u201cI said, once we get in there, leave Lan Wangji alone,\u201d Jiang Cheng says, and Wei Wuxian sighs and nods.</p>\n<p>He will, he\u2019ll be nice. He\u2019ll be good. He\u2019ll try.</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji does not go to the Library Pavilion, as he said he would. Instead, once he gets there, he heads right back to the <em>jingshi, </em>the long way around, to clear his head. He\u2019s far too scrambled at the moment to sit in the heavy, enfolding silence of the library, to focus his energy for hours on end on the neat lines of texts and scrolls.</p>\n<p>For a moment, once he steps into the <em> jingshi, </em>Lan Wangji just breathes, closes his eyes, and tries to allow the familiar aromas of incense and sandalwood to calm his mind.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Then Lan Wangji stares down at his hands \u2014 Wei Ying\u2019s hands. He has always thought them beautiful in their own way, somewhat smaller and darker-skinned than his own, rough with calluses from sword-fighting and archery and climbing trees and\u2014whatever else Wei Ying had done in Yunmeng. Nonetheless graceful, and nimble, and sure.</p>\n<p>Wei Ying talks a lot \u2014 almost anyone, other than Lan Wangji, would say too much \u2014 but Lan Wangji is always listening, hoarding pieces of information like a crow with pieces of scrap metal. He\u2019s hungry to know every detail of Wei Ying\u2019s life, his passions, his interests, what makes him laugh, what makes him upset or sad. At first, his dedicated interest in this matter had confused and infuriated him, but he had long ago given up his resistance to liking Wei Ying, helplessly and adoringly.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Now that he\u2019s alone with Wei Ying\u2019s body, his thoughts are deafening, too loud for his head. Far, far too often than he would ever allow himself to admit, he had imagined, dreamed about what Wei Ying would look like, with the layers all gone, but <em> this </em>\u2014 this is not what he envisioned. This is never something he would have asked for, or desired for either of them. It feels horrifically invasive, and shameful, and \u2014</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji locates the single, floor-length mirror in the room and for a moment, just stares, his breath catching.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He can never let himself look at Wei Ying for too long, so he can never drink his fill of Wei Ying\u2019s features the way that he\u2019d like to\u2014 he stores flashes of Wei Ying\u2019s expressions and features away, guards them jealously to turn over later in the most private corners of his thoughts. He isn\u2019t sure what to do now that he\u2019s allowed to....look, for as long as he wants to.</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji sits, his legs crossed, and leans closer to the bronze glass.</p>\n<p>Wei Ying is handsome, of course \u2014 unmistakably beautiful, no matter what self-deprecating, laughing remarks he throws away. The most beautiful person Lan Wangji has met in his life \u2014 as he\u2019d known, unfortunately and immediately, from their first moonlit fight on the rooftops of Cloud Recesses. It had angered him, flustered him, and\u2026</p>\n<p>He raises a shaking hand to Wei Ying\u2019s cheek, catches one brush of soft, warm skin before he yanks away as though he\u2019s been burned.</p>\n<p><em> No.</em>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He isn\u2019t allowed this. It\u2019s not the same as if \u2014 as if he himself were to touch Wei Ying, like this. Would he be allowed to? Would Wei Ying let him?\u00a0</p>\n<p>Still, he can\u2019t resist drawing one finger, feather-light, over the bow shape of Wei Ying\u2019s lips, so often curled up in a coy or delighted smile. He tries to smile to replicate the expression, but it feels wrong, lifeless, hollow. He suddenly, fiercely misses Wei Ying in his own body; Lan Wangji is a trespasser here, taking up space somewhere where he doesn\u2019t belong.</p>\n<p>And\u2026</p>\n<p>He drops one hand to cup Wei Ying\u2019s sternum, feeling the emptiness there like a dark void. Wei Ying\u2019s golden core, surgically and cruelly hacked out \u2014 with a knife? With a scalpel, a hand? There's nothing left behind except a carved-out space that Lan Wangji can feel like a drumbeat.</p>\n<p>He feels sick. He thinks, for one sure moment, that he\u2019s going to be physically ill, when he hears a single knock and a clatter of feet at the door, and \u2014 it\u2019s Wei Ying, awkward and clumsy in his too-big body, who stops and stares in confusion at the sight of Lan Wangji on the ground.</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji jerks back from the mirror, his stomach still twisting.</p>\n<p>Wei Ying keeps staring, and asks, \u201cLan Zhan, are you okay? I couldn\u2019t find you in the library, so I thought that\u2019d you\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>It takes a blink for Lan Wangji to realize there are tears in his eyes, and that\u2019s why Wei Ying is looking at him with such perplexed concern. He stands abruptly, almost stumbling as Wei Ying\u2019s feet get tangled together beneath him.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d he says. \u201cWhat do you need?\u201d</p>\n<p>Wei Ying is still staring at him, through Lan Wangji\u2019s own features, with an unbearably soft expression, and Lan Wangji feels that sick, tilted lurch again like the ground dropping out under his feet. Is this what he looks like, when he looks at Wei Ying? Is it so obvious?</p>\n<p>\u201cHere, sit,\u201d Wei Ying says, taking Lan Wangji by the wrists and leading him to sit on the bed. \u201cListen. Lan Zhan. I know this whole thing, with \u2014 with the soul-switch, it\u2019s upsetting. And believe me, I know my body is the last one on earth you\u2019d want to be inside of.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji chokes, then passes it off as a cough.</p>\n<p>\u201cI know I haven\u2019t made this easy,\u201d Wei Ying continues, looking so earnestly remorseful that Lan Wangji\u2019s heart gives a pathetic little kick. \u201cBut I promise, it\u2019s not forever. We\u2019re going to find a way back, especially with Jiang Cheng helping us now.\u201d He frowns, thinking seriously on something for a moment, before he adds, \u201cI\u2019m sorry it had to be me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji is a step behind, but doesn\u2019t say anything, waiting for Wei Ying to clarify.</p>\n<p>Wei Ying correctly interprets the silence and clarifies, \u201cI\u2019m sorry I was with you for the curse, when it happened. I\u2019m sure you\u2019d prefer to be stuck in this with anyone else, and I don\u2019t blame you.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>He scratches the back of his head, looking sort of forlorn and so unlike himself that Lan Wangji fights the bizarre urge to place a hand on his own shoulder.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Still, he cannot allow Wei Ying to get this so wrong, as he does with so many other things between them.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d he says, firm.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNo?\u201d Wei Ying echoes.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou are wrong,\u201d Lan Wangji says quietly. \u201cWei Ying is the only person that would make this tolerable.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wei Ying\u2019s eyes widen, and then brighten, and then he smiles, an expression so unfamiliar on his own face and so very <em> Wei Ying </em> that Lan Wangji stares.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, good, because I feel the same way,\u201d Wei Ying says, leaning one shoulder familiarly into Lan Wangji\u2019s. Lan Wangji\u2019s toes curl in his shoes. \u201cCan you even <em>imagine </em>if I had swapped with Jiang Cheng? Or <em>Jin Zixuan</em>? I would do everyone a favor and throw myself off a cliff.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWei Ying,\u201d Lan Wangji is horrified into saying.</p>\n<p>\u201cKidding, kidding,\u201d Wei Ying says, backtracking with a chuckle. \u201cAiya, so serious, Lan Zhan. I\u2019m almost never serious, you know?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI do,\u201d Lan Wangji mutters, and Wei Ying laughs openly and throws an elbow into his ribs.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay, okay. I know you\u2019re going to be angry with me for this suggestion, but really, Lan Zhan, look at my clothes.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji does look. The usually-spotless white is faded with dust, streaked here and there with dried blood and mud. It\u2019s a rare occurrence, maybe nonexistent, that anyone should see Hanguang-Jun in such a state, and of course, in any other situation he would change clothes the moment he returned from the hunt, but\u2026\u00a0</p>\n<p>He swallows with discomfort.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd yours,\u201d Wei Ying says, tugging at his black lapel. \u201cI know you have a strong sense of modesty, but something must be done.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wei Ying is right \u2014 of course he is. And yet Lan Wangji still feels a crimson flush starting at the base of his throat, spreading up like wildfire.</p>\n<p>\u201cI know you Lans are \u2014 ah, private folk,\u201d Wei Ying says, his eyes tracking the vertical progress of the blush. \u201cBut bodies are just bodies. I promise I\u2019ll be as respectful as possible.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji wants to tell him it\u2019s fine, that he trusts him \u2014 that he\u2019s right \u2014 but of course, he can\u2019t say any of that. He doesn\u2019t trust himself to say anything at all.</p>\n<p>\u201cHow\u2019s this \u2014 I can change clothes here, if you like,\u201d Wei Ying suggests. \u201cWe\u2019re already in the <em> jingshi, </em>and that way you can look at me, and I\u2019ll keep my eyes on you.\u201d</p>\n<p>That does make Lan Wangji feel somewhat better. He relaxes and gives a slight nod. Wei Ying smiles in response.</p>\n<p>\u201cThank heavens,\u201d Wei Ying groans, rolling away from him and stretching his arms above his head. \u201cI thought I was going to die if I stayed in these any longer. Okay, help me. I don\u2019t know how to get any of this off.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji\u2019s pulse crashes in his throat, in his ears, but he rises without a word and helps Wei Ying with the outer two layers with practiced ease, folding each one neatly on the bed.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, this is strange,\u201d Wei Ying says, with a faint laugh, \u201clooking at my own face while you do this.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji resolutely ignores the itchy heat in his ears and helps untangle the other layer until it\u2019s just the inner robe left, and his pants. He\u2019s never seen his own body from the outside, and of course doesn\u2019t think much of it either way, but he does wonder what Wei Ying truly thinks of it \u2014 what it would look like to him.</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you want to take things from here?\u201d Wei Ying asks, staring at him uncertainly.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cLeave the pants on,\u201d Lan Wangji says, and swallows hard. \u201cI\u2019ll get clean clothes for the rest.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLan Zhan, I\u2019m going to have to bathe at some point,\u201d Wei Ying calls after him, as if Lan Wangji needs any reminder of that excruciating fact. \u201cHanguang-Jun is well-known for his fresh, aromatic musk. You can\u2019t have him walking around looking and smelling like this.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cEnough,\u201d Lan Wangji says, hearing the laugh in Wei Ying\u2019s voice and feeling ridiculously flustered.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, Lan Zhan. I understand,\u201d Wei Ying says, more thoughtful than before. \u201cBeing in another man\u2019s body repulses you, of course.\u201d</p>\n<p>That is certainly not the problem. Lan Wangji suddenly wonders, with a flash of dread, <em> Is that how Wei Ying feels about it? </em></p>\n<p>\u201cBut I swear, my body\u2019s not that bad! Other than, ah, the lack of spiritual power. It\u2019s probably not even that much different than yours.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji wishes he would just stop talking. He returns and drops the fresh robes at his feet, glaring up at Wei Ying \u2014 rather than glaring down, as is usual.</p>\n<p>Wei Ying smiles at him, sunny and beatific. He pitches his voice low, gazing at him from underneath dark lashes. \u201cThank you, Wei Ying.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji can\u2019t help it \u2014 he scoffs. It\u2019s not quite a laugh, but Wei Ying perks up regardless.</p>\n<p>\u201cNow you,\u201d he says, then begins quickly and effortlessly stripping Lan Wangji before he can blink.</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji makes an instinctive noise of protest and rears back, but Wei Ying frowns at him and says, \u201cIt\u2019s only fair,\u201d so Lan Wangji just stands there, numbly, dumbly, as Wei Ying uses Lan Wangji\u2019s own hands, fingers, arms to divest him of his clothes.</p>\n<p>\u201cMy body can just borrow some of your training robes while I clean my usual clothes, if that\u2019s alright,\u201d Wei Ying is chattering, the cadence of which sounds strange in Lan Wangji\u2019s voice. \u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019ve got them stored away in the back of your closet somewhere.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji feels cool air brush against his chest as Wei Ying pushes off his red inner robe, and he closes his eyes. The heat is back, everywhere, making him feel flushed all over. He will not look.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cLan Zhan, it\u2019s fine,\u201d Wei Ying says, sounding amused. \u201cI appreciate your chivalry, I really do, but I have nothing to hide.\u201d</p>\n<p>When Lan Wangji opens his eyes, Wei Ying is similarly bare before him. He maintains determined eye contact with Lan Wangji, as if to prove true on his word.</p>\n<p>\u201cSee? Not so bad at all,\u201d Wei Ying says, gentler now, and Lan Wangji looks away.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe can bathe in Cold Spring later,\u201d Lan Wangji tells the wall. \u201cThat way we can keep undergarments on.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhatever makes you comfortable,\u201d Wei Ying says, and then he pauses, and Lan Wangji jumps when he feels the tentative brush of fingers across his abdomen. On reflex, he catches Wei Ying\u2019s hand to stop him, and then the two are caught as though in amber, staring at each other.</p>\n<p>\u201cSorry,\u201d Wei Ying says, swallowing. \u201cIt\u2019s just, aha \u2014 it\u2019s my body, and from the outside, I hadn\u2019t seen\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji can\u2019t help it; he looks down, where his fingers are still wrapped around Wei Ying\u2019s. A large, pink scar blooms below Wei Ying's navel, the skin raised and puckered, and it still looks somewhat new, as though it recently finished healing.</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji stumbles at the sight of it, his head spinning with imagery of what it means, of what Wei Ying had endured to get it.</p>\n<p>\u201cLan Zhan,\u201d Wei Ying says, steadying him with large, cool hands. \u201cAhaha. I know I have a nice body, but fainting is a little dramatic, don\u2019t you think?\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Like a man possessed, Lan Wangji forgets his promise to himself: He drops his hand to the scar and traces two gentle fingers over the shape of it. As though his touch could absorb the pain, the memory of it into himself.</p>\n<p>He hears Wei Ying\u2019s sucked-in, choked breath as though from far away.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Lan Wangji says, his hand jerking away as though burned. He closes his eyes, unable to look Wei Ying in the face. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHey, no apologizing,\u201d Wei Ying says. His voice sounds fainter than before. \u201cI told you it\u2019s okay to be curious. It\u2019s ugly, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji chokes on his words again. He wants to say that no part of Wei Ying could ever be ugly, never, never \u2014 but he doesn\u2019t, just breathes. He could drown in unspoken words, in the sea of everything he hasn\u2019t said.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou know, Hanguang-Jun, you\u2019re surprisingly sweet,\u201d Wei Ying says, his eyes sliding over Lan Wangji\u2019s face thoughtfully. \u201cSuch a gentleman, as they all say.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji shoots him a half-hearted glare, certain he\u2019s being teased again, but Wei Ying just smiles back at him, his expression open and bemused.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re always doing that, surprising me,\u201d Wei Ying says, and then his smile falters into a serious line, and he stares at Lan Wangji, more intently than before, like he\u2019s trying to parse something out from him.</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji takes a step back, putting more space between them. Wei Ying\u2019s expression shutters at once, and he picks up the clean inner robe from the floor.</p>\n<p>\u201cOnly three layers, Lan Zhan? Won\u2019t people think you\u2019re a tease?\u201d Wei Ying says, and Lan Wangji ignores him, just focuses on putting on his own clothes while trying to see as little of Wei Ying\u2019s body as possible. Trying to burn the image of the scar from his mind.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s been a long day,\u201d Wei Ying continues once he\u2019s fully dressed. He adjusts his forehead ribbon with a casualness that makes something in Lan Wangji lurch with both horror and something else that he can\u2019t decipher. It might be longing, which he\u2019s discovered takes infinitely painful forms. \u201cI\u2019d say it\u2019s time for a drink, wouldn\u2019t you, Lan Zhan?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Lan Wangji replies at once, and he tries not to envision the horrors of a rowdy Wei Ying getting drunk in his body.</p>\n<p>\u201cLan <em> Zhaaaan,</em>\u201d Wei Ying whines, crowding closer to him and taking both of his wrists. He starts to lightly swing their hands from side to side. \u201cLan Wangji, Hanguang-Jun, Ji-xiong, Lan er-gege\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cStop that,\u201d Lan Wangji says quietly. He deflects the warmth of Wei Ying\u2019s teasing, probing gaze, and focuses on fixing one of his sleeves.</p>\n<p>\u201cSurely you won\u2019t deny me this?\u201d Wei Ying continues, wheedling and relentless. \u201cI still have some Emperor\u2019s Smile back in my room. Think of how traumatic today has been for both of us. Let me have a little happiness, yeah? There\u2019s nothing else to do in the Cloud Recesses. I\u2019ll stay right here in the <em> jingshi </em>with you; no one will see Hanguang-Jun getting drunk, I swear on the Heavens and Earth.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji has quickly come to discover that he can\u2019t resist Wei Ying a single thing, especially where his happiness is involved, and the revelation has been somewhat unfortunate. It does not bode well for him, given the force of Wei Ying\u2019s will could rival that of a noonday sun\u2019s.</p>\n<p>He sighs, and looks up into Wei Ying\u2019s pleading eyes, the gold there lighter and warmer than it\u2019s surely ever been.</p>\n<p>\u201cFine,\u201d he says.</p>\n<p>Wei Ying brightens even further, the wattage on his smile doubling. Lan Wangji can\u2019t look at it directly, even on another\u2019s face.</p>\n<p>\u201cWow, wow,\u201d Wei Ying says musingly, still grinning. \u201cI really didn\u2019t expect you to say yes! You\u2019ve changed from the boy I met on the rooftop, Lan Zhan. I like the new and improved you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji tries to ignore the pleased warmth that gutters to life in him at these words, like a candle flaring up.</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t move,\u201d Wei Ying says, squeezing his wrists before letting them go. \u201cI\u2019ll be right back.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji tries to say, \u201cNo running,\u201d but Wei Ying is out the door before the words have left his mouth. He sighs, and stares uncertainly after him. Although they had managed to keep the secret from Jiang Yanli, it\u2019s only a matter of time before everyone else knows the truth, including his brother. The ruse is seemingly too impossible for both of them to keep up.</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji closes his eyes, feeling weary to the bone. He sits on his bed, soaking in the quiet, the gentle rustle of the trees outside his window. Wei Ying will be back soon with alcohol, which Lan Wangji, at one point not so long ago, never would have permitted. Wei Ying will cozy up into his space, and touch him with casual, teasing hands, and Lan Wangji will burn, as he has for what feels like a lifetime.</p>\n<p>Heavens help him, he thinks.</p>\n<p>When Wei Ying returns, he finds Lan Wangji upside down, his heels against the <em> jingshi\u2019s </em>wall and his arms shaking with strain beneath him.</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji sees Wei Ying pause and set the two jars of Emperor\u2019s Smile on the table, then he ducks his head upside down to grin at him. \u201cLan Zhan. What are you doing?\u201d</p>\n<p>It\u2019s pretty self-evident what Lan Wangji is doing, so he doesn\u2019t bother to answer.</p>\n<p>\u201cAh, Lan Zhan, I think you\u2019ll find my body lacks the upper strength of yours,\u201d Wei Ying says with a chuckle, sitting cross-legged at the table and giving him a delighted look.</p>\n<p>\u201c...Mn,\u201d Lan Wangji concedes, because it is true.</p>\n<p>\u201cAlthough my core strength can\u2019t be beat. <em> Ha</em>!\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji does his best from his current position to scowl unappreciatively at him.</p>\n<p>\u201cToo soon for core jokes, I see. That is noted. Why are you doing handstands, Hanguang-Jun?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFocus,\u201d Lan Wangji says through gritted teeth. He can feel all of the blood in his face pounding from the effort of keeping himself upright. \u201cAnd restraint.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNeither of which I have,\u201d Wei Ying points out. He tilts his head, his eyes gleaming with mischief. \u201cIs there someone specific who has tested your focus and restraint, Hanguang-Jun?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cRidiculous,\u201d Lan Wangji retorts on reflex, but it comes out sounding very wheezy and weak.</p>\n<p>Wei Ying laughs at him, clutching his sides as he does so. Lan Wangji finally gives in, kicking off from one of his heels so that he\u2019s upright again. Wei Ying politely applauds him.</p>\n<p>\u201cMaybe if you stay in my body longer, I can be as fit as you are,\u201d Wei Ying teases. \u201cYou\u2019re welcome to wear it out all you want, you know.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji has no reply to that, so he sits down across from Wei Ying at the table in lieu of a response.</p>\n<p>Wei Ying nudges one jar of the Emperor\u2019s Smile at him across the table. \u201cFor you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji says nothing in reply, but nudges it back in a clear rebuttal.</p>\n<p>\u201cFine. More for me, then.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWei Ying,\u201d Lan Wangji says, and Wei Ying pauses just as he leans his head back to take a swig. \u201cBe careful.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m always careful,\u201d he answers with a wink. He starts to earnestly gulp the liquor with such a fixed eagerness that for some reason Lan Wangji looks away, feeling hot and embarrassed.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand why you react to this so strongly,\u201d Wei Ying says after he finishes the first bottle, reaching over to grab the second. \u201cI don\u2019t even f\u2014\u201d His shoulders suddenly sag, his eyelids drooping. \u201cOh.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWei Ying,\u201d Lan Wangji says.</p>\n<p>\u201cMmmmm. I\u2019m \u2014 <em> tired</em>, Lan Zhan,\u201d Wei Ying murmurs, sounding confused, and then his head lolls, and he\u2019s out.</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji stares in disbelief for another moment \u2014 never, in their entire relationship, has he witnessed Wei Ying rendered so obsolete by liquor \u2014 before he sighs, crossing to him to help him lay down. It will only be a matter of time before he wakes.</p>\n<p>In the meantime, Lan Wangji practices the guqin. Without spiritual power, the notes ring quite hollow, and they\u2019ll have no effect on Wei Ying either way, but his fingers are true to the melody, and it sounds pleasant regardless. After only a few minutes, his fingertips ache against the strings; Wei Ying has none of the calluses that he\u2019s built over thousands of hours of practice, over the years.</p>\n<p>Eventually, after about two joss sticks\u2019 time, Wei Ying starts to stir, mumbling to himself and clutching his head. Lan Wangji rests his palms on the strings, then crosses back to join him.</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji helps him into a sitting position, his hand lingering in the crook of his elbow. \u201cHow do you feel?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI feel\u2026\u201d Wei Ying pauses and frowns, as though searching hard for a word, before he settles on, \u201c<em>Very </em>drunk.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji huffs a quiet breath.</p>\n<p>Wei Ying casts about for a moment, then latches on to Lan Wangji\u2019s arm. \u201cLan Zhan, how can someone with your body and your constitution be such a lightweight? I don\u2019t understand it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cXiongzhang is the same way,\u201d Lan Wangji replies, trying to conceal the amusement in his voice. \u201cYou were warned.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI was,\u201d Wei Ying says. \u201cI feel like it\u2019s \u2014 like it\u2019s hitting more by the second, <em> oh.</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMn,\u201d Lan Wangji says, and suppresses the fond tilt of his mouth.</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you laughing at me?\u201d Wei Ying peers at him suspiciously through red-tinged eyes. \u201cThat\u2019s your laughing, <em> Wei-Ying-is-so-stupid </em>\u2018mn.\u2019\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cA little,\u201d Lan Wangji admits, and Wei Ying\u2019s eyes widen in surprise, and then delight.</p>\n<p>\u201cFine, I deserve it,\u201d he says, and as though encouraged by the way Lan Wangji is looking at him, he scoots closer to Lan Wangji\u2019s side so they\u2019re shoulder to shoulder. \u201cLaugh at me, Hanguang-Jun, I want to hear you laugh.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji presses his lips together against another small smile. He does not laugh, because he never does, but Wei Ying\u2019s face grows softer at the expression, his eyes widening.</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji lets go of his arm, and sits across from him, cross-legged at the table, and sets out a cup for himself, and one with water for Wei Ying.</p>\n<p>Wei Ying hazily watches him for a moment before he speaks.</p>\n<p>\u201cTell me, ah \u2014 Lan Zhan,\u201d he slurs, then blinks at him. \u201cHave you ever liked someone?\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji hesitates in his tea-pouring, probably for too long. Then he resumes and gives one nod.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d Wei Ying says. \u201cWow! I can only imagine the type of person to capture Hanguang-Jun\u2019s attention.\u201d He laughs, but the sound is strangely brittle.</p>\n<p>For a conflicted moment, Lan Wangji wages an inner battle \u2014 fighting not to ask the question he knows will only torment him, but that he\u2019s dying to know the answer to.</p>\n<p>After another few beats of silence, he gives in. Asks, quietly, \u201cAnd you?\u201d</p>\n<p>Wei Ying stares at him with a glassy, slightly unfocused expression. He nods then, unusually serious.</p>\n<p>A crosswind of emotion tears through Lan Wangji, jealousy and despair vying for dominance. Of course Wei Ying has liked people \u2014 Lan Wangji already knew this. Wei Ying flirts and charms and loves with a crushing force; it\u2019s only the natural assumption that Wei Ying has fallen for someone, maybe multiple people. But to hear it confirmed \u2014 to know there\u2019s another, even at some point in the past \u2014 settles like an ulcer in Lan Wangji\u2019s stomach.</p>\n<p>Wei Ying blinks at him sleepily, then props his chin on his hand, almost missing it. He sways a bit in place. \u201cCan you tell me about her, Lan Zhan? I\u2019m curious.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji keeps his eyes down. Surely, the truth is glaringly obvious, just by looking at his face.</p>\n<p>\u201cBrave,\u201d he answers, after another moment. \u201cClever. Brilliant. Warm. Caring. Funny. Selfless. Beautiful.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>The paltry handful of words seems almost unfair in their lack, so woefully inadequate. Lan Wangji doesn\u2019t spill out the words that he could say: that before Wei Ying, his life had felt like an unending, gray rain, and Wei Ying had been like the first ray of sun fracturing through the gloom, incandescent and revelatory and impossible to resist.</p>\n<p>Wei Ying is staring at him with a strange expression. Lan Wangji can\u2019t quite decipher it.</p>\n<p>\u201cSuch a romantic after all, Lan Zhan ah,\u201d he says softly after another minute. \u201cShe sounds like quite the person indeed, to have won the heart of Hanguang-Jun.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji glares at him in exasperation, but Wei Ying is looking at the floor now, his expression closed off, uncommonly quiet. Lan Wangji was expecting more teasing, so the reticent reaction surprises him.</p>\n<p>Wei Ying\u2019s eyes flutter closed, and he sways again.</p>\n<p>\u201cWei Ying,\u201d Lan Wangji says, standing to cross over to him. \u201cYou should sleep.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t want to,\u201d he mumbles, leaning into Lan Wangji\u2019s touch. \u201cWanna do something with you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDo something,\u201d Lan Wangji echoes, a question for clarification.</p>\n<p>\u201cSomething fun.\u201d Wei Ying lurches to his feet, planting a hand on the table to steady himself even as Lan Wangji keeps a firm grip on his opposite arm. \u201cLet\u2019s break rules. It\u2019s so <em> boring </em> here.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWei Ying promised to stay in the <em> jingshi,</em>\u201d Lan Wangji reminds him, with absolutely zero faith in this tactic.</p>\n<p>Wei Ying frowns, his brows scrunching together and his lip pushing out slightly. \u201cNever did.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYour memory is poor,\u201d says Lan Wangji.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m tired of being dirty, Lan Zhan,\u201d Wei Ying complains, and holds out his arm demonstratively. \u201cLook how dirty.\u201d A despondent look crosses his face. \u201cI\u2019m in Hanguang-Jun\u2019s body and I\u2019ve made him so dirty.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWei Ying,\u201d Lan Wangji says, not entirely sure if they\u2019re having a conversation with a double meaning. \u201cIt is fine.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wei Ying groans, then shrugs out of one of Lan Wangji\u2019s outer layers. It crumples to the floor. His brow is dewed with sweat. \u201cLet\u2019s go to Cold Spring, Lan Zhan. I\u2019m so hot and dirty.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo Cold Spring,\u201d Lan Wangji says firmly. He cannot even fathom the repercussions of someone finding his intoxicated body trawling through Cloud Recesses.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This had, indeed, been a spectacularly awful idea.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll be so quiet,\u201d Wei Ying whispers, clinging onto both of Lan Wangji\u2019s arms. Lan Wangji wilts a little. \u201cI\u2019ll be so good, Lan Zhan, I promise, <em> please.</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Lan Wangji repeats, with wavering certainty.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Ying, even drunk, smells a victory and presses his advantage. \u201cIt can\u2019t be comfortable for you either, having all that muck and dirt and sweat from earlier on your skin. If anyone sees us, you can talk for us, okay? I\u2019ll be my best Hanguang-Jun and be totally quiet.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji sighs. He doesn\u2019t believe Wei Ying is fundamentally capable of being quiet in any circumstance. However, Cold Spring does sound appealing at the moment, even if just to clear his addled mind. And it will perhaps help Wei Ying calm down from whatever state he\u2019s working himself toward.</p>\n<p>\u201cDo not leave my side,\u201d he warns, and Wei Ying beams and affectionately pets his cheek.</p>\n<p>\u201cGood boy, Lan Zhan, you\u2019re so good to me,\u201d Wei Ying mumbles, listing sideways a bit, and Lan Wangji once again has to question his own soundness of mind.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He leads Wei Ying toward the entrance of the <em> jingshi, </em>and then they\u2019re out into the fresh evening air, cooler than inside but still warm enough to warrant a trip to the springs. Wei Ying sighs contentedly, then slips his hand into Lan Wangji\u2019s and squeezes. Lan Wangji almost physically starts, heat blazing in his cheeks at the casual gesture.</p>\n<p>Keeping an iron grip on his hand, Wei Ying leans his body into Lan Wangji\u2019s, a warm press at his side. \u201cNice night.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c...Mn,\u201d Lan Wangji says, sensing that his input is desired.</p>\n<p>\u201cLook at the moon,\u201d Wei Ying says in a low, singing voice, tipping his chin upward to stare with an awed expression. \u201cSo strong and devoted and handsome.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji looks at him strangely, then replies, for lack of something better to say, \u201cYes.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wei Ying closes his eyes and hiccups, still gripping onto him as they walk. \u201cI\u2019m gonna regret this tomorrow, aren\u2019t I, Lan Zhan? Am I acting foolish?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Lan Wangji says kindly.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes I am,\u201d Wei Ying sighs. \u201cI\u2019m an embarrassment to the GusuLan sect.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Lan Wangji repeats, with more force.</p>\n<p>\u201cHm. If you say so,\u201d Wei Ying says, complacent again. \u201cIt\u2019s no wonder you don\u2019t drink, Lan Zhan. I\u2019ll never pass judgment on you again, I promise. This is very tragic for you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji is content to let Wei Ying babble as they make their way along the wooded path to Cold Spring. He keeps a keen eye out for anyone who may be out walking and see them, but Wei Ying\u2019s senses are duller than his own, with his lack of spiritual power. The moonlight illuminates their way along the steep path, at least, the surrounding trees tipped in silver like a colorless painting.</p>\n<p>When they reach Cold Spring, Lan Wangji helps Wei Ying pick his way down the slippery rocks \u2014 and once they reach the water, Lan Wangji hesitates. Wei Ying doesn\u2019t; he lets go of Lan Wangji and begins peeling off the rest of his layers, his expression slightly vacant but still set with concentration.</p>\n<p>Wei Ying glances over to him, finally seeming to notice that Lan Wangji has frozen in place. \u201cYou can take my clothes off. I don\u2019t care if you see me.\u201d</p>\n<p><em> I do, </em> Lan Wangji wants to say, unsure how to proceed.</p>\n<p>Wei Ying sheds his last layer, leaving Lan Wangji\u2019s pale chest bare, nearly luminescent under the bright cast of the moon. He rolls his shoulders and his neck, then hooks his thumbs in Lan Wangji\u2019s waistband \u2014</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji\u2019s hand shoots out to stop him.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2014?\u201d Wei Ying frowns down in confusion at it, then says, \u201cOh, right. Why are you still dressed?\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji swallows, then squeezes his eyes shut when Wei Ying starts to undress him, his hands moving with quicker certainty than he would expect from his current state of inebriation.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re so strange, Hanguang-Jun,\u201d Wei Ying murmurs, and Lan Wangji feels the brush of night air against his exposed chest. \u201cBut I still like you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wei Ying\u2019s hands move to his waistband with intention, and again, Lan Wangji stops him, keeping his eyes closed. He can feel the hot throb of his pulse through every limb in his body, and he is suddenly very desperate to be in cold water, away from Wei Ying\u2019s closeness and heat.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with this?\u201d Wei Ying asks in a low voice. The glassy, hollow look in his eyes gives away his drunkenness, but he sounds very much not so, and Lan Wangji swallows hard. \u201cAre you really so disgusted by my body that you won\u2019t look at me or touch me, Lan Zhan?\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji turns his face away, not possessing a single response to that. To deny it as emphatically as he feels would no doubt give him right away.</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Wei Ying says, taking a step back. The moment he does, Lan Wangji aches for him closer. \u201cLet\u2019s swim.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cStay above water,\u201d Lan Wangji tells him, suddenly alarmed, and Wei Ying waves him off with a hand.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve been swimming my whole life,\u201d he says, dipping a toe in the water and recoiling from the temperature at once. \u201cCould swim in my sleep.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wei Ying wades in waist-deep, visibly shivering, and Lan Wangji watches him from behind, again feeling strangely out-of-body \u2014 seeing his own half-naked form moving about the water, independently of himself.</p>\n<p>After another moment of hesitation, Lan Wangji follows after Wei Ying, the chill lancing straight through him to the bone. Wei Ying\u2019s body is unused to the conditions of Cold Spring, especially without a core to mediate the effects, so he shakes at the cold, shakes so hard that Wei Ying turns and notices.</p>\n<p>\u201cI think it\u2019s warmer by you,\u201d he says, drifting over with a mischievous smile, and Lan Wangji tries to take a stumbling step back but nearly hits a sharp rock with the heel of his foot. Steam curls up from both of their bodies, and for a long time, they just stare at each other, perhaps both absorbing the sheer oddness of their situation.</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji does feel better in the water \u2014 more focused, less aroused and flustered. The chill drives out any distracting sensation; the pain of coldness is the only thing his mind can focus on. He had come here often when Wei Ying first arrived at the Cloud Recesses for these same results, meditating and reciting the Lan sect rules until he could no longer hear Wei Ying\u2019s shimmering laughter, see his eyes or his smile or the curve of his narrow waist.</p>\n<p>\u201cLan Zhan,\u201d Wei Ying says, much closer now, and Lan Wangji\u2019s eyes flare open. Wei Ying stands before him, taller, more muscular, paler, light-eyed, but the same person regardless, looking at him.</p>\n<p>\u201cI feel sober,\u201d Wei Ying says, still slurring his words.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou are not,\u201d Lan Wangji informs him.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe cold, though, it \u2014 it\u2019s cleared my head a little,\u201d he says, then frowns at him. \u201cLan Zhan, you look blue.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m f-fine,\u201d Lan Wangji says, surprised and disgruntled to feel his teeth chattering.</p>\n<p>Cold fingers find his chin and gently tilt his head up, and Lan Wangji steels his nerve and meets Wei Ying\u2019s gaze without looking away.\u00a0</p>\n<p>In the endless reading of his youth, Lan Wangji had read reports and stories in the library\u2019s archives of Tao masters bursting suddenly into flame, withering up into ash within moments, seemingly with no explanation aside from some mysterious, esoteric form of spiritual ascendance. He had always scoffed with disbelief at the outlandishness of the stories.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Now, he thinks he understands how it would feel.</p>\n<p>Wei Ying\u2019s eyes flicker across his face, as though intently searching for something, and after a moment, he smiles.</p>\n<p>\u201cI can still see you,\u201d he says. \u201cEven in my own face. Your eyes are the same.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji shakes harder, not entirely from the cold. He starts to feel dizzy again. He should put a stop to whatever strange alchemy is unfolding between them \u2014 not like this, not when they don\u2019t have their bodies and Wei Ying is too drunk to know left from right. Not like this.</p>\n<p>\u201cCan you see me too?\u201d Wei Ying asks.\u00a0</p>\n<p>His hand finds Lan Wangji\u2019s chest, palm laying flat over his racing heart; it\u2019s the only point of warmth in his entire body. Wei Ying reaches for Lan Wangji\u2019s hand, now almost numb of feeling, and places it over his own chest, over the heart beating in Lan Wangji\u2019s body. His own pulse also thunders there, much quicker than normal.</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji tries to breathe.</p>\n<p>Wei Ying looks down at himself then, as though drinking in the sight of Lan Wangji\u2019s body, of their joined hands, before he murmurs, \u201cAll of this, and what do you do with it, Lan Zhan? Keep it selfishly stored away?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cStop,\u201d Lan Wangji whispers, all the force and heat to the command gone. He isn\u2019t sure what he\u2019s asking anymore, or what he wants in this moment.</p>\n<p>Wei Ying playfully skims a thumb over his nipple, stiff with the cold, and Lan Wangji returns to himself with the bolt of desire that cracks through him, weakening his knees. He pulls away at once, breathing raggedly. He wants desperately to touch himself, to quell the ache between his legs and make it disappear, but he <em> can\u2019t, </em>not when \u2014</p>\n<p>Wei Ying blinks at him a few times, as though confused. He licks his lips and takes a step back of his own. Then, as if nothing had happened, he sets about washing his limbs in a methodical manner, scrubbing off the dirt and sweat off Lan Wangji\u2019s body with an empty expression.</p>\n<p><em> Still drunk, </em> Lan Wangji reminds himself as he stares, his heart still galloping madly. Wei Ying won\u2019t remember any of this, come tomorrow.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He woodenly follows Wei Ying\u2019s example, sluicing icy water over his arms and chest and face. He tries to ignore the gnarled knot of scar tissue in the center of Wei Ying\u2019s abdomen, the sun-shaped brand seared into his pectoral, the roping burn scars from Zidian snaking along his sides and ribs. A physical topography of self-sacrifice \u2014 permanent reminders of Wei Ying\u2019s opinion of himself when weighed against others\u2019 needs.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji wonders if one day, he can return the favor for Wei Ying with his own body.</p>\n<p>\u201cLet\u2019s go back,\u201d Wei Ying announces, abruptly moving toward the shore, and Lan Wangji blinks after him.</p>\n<p>Wei Ying stumbles as he shrugs into Lan Wangji\u2019s clothes, but is otherwise quiet and composed as Lan Wangji dresses alongside him. His old clothes feel grimy on his newly clean skin.</p>\n<p>Wei Ying takes Lan Wangji\u2019s arm again in a dutiful manner, as though Lan Wangji is the one who needs assistance, and pulls him up the wooded path, their shoes squelching beneath them.</p>\n<p>For a long moment, there\u2019s silence between them before Wei Ying speaks again.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou know what, Lan Zhan,\u201d Wei Ying says, drooping heavily into his side. \u201cI think liking someone is the worst thing that can ever happen to a person.\u201d</p>\n<p>This conversation again. Lan Wangji experiences that same acidic sensation as he did before, eating away at his insides. To have to listen to this seems like a unique form of karmic punishment.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt feels good, but it hurts,\u201d Wei Ying whispers, staring off with a faraway expression, eyes hazy. \u201cIt feels like being sad, the ache of it, then it feels all warm and mushy when you see them, too. And it feels like...even the hurt is worth it, to know they exist. Do you know what I mean?\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji does. Oh, he does.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d he says coldly, hoping to put a fast end to this discussion.</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t ever like someone,\u201d Wei Ying says mournfully. \u201cI think I would rather get beaten up than feel this way even one second longer.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji wants to ask just who it is that\u2019s reduced the dauntless, shameless Wei Wuxian to such a state, but he doesn\u2019t dare, for fear that once he has a name, he might track the person down and do something he regrets.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, it\u2019s Zewu-Jun,\u201d Wei Ying says, which snaps Lan Wangji right back to the situation at hand.</p>\n<p>It is, indeed, his xiongzhang, moving toward them quickly and silently in the cover of the night, his multi-pronged headpiece glinting as it catches different shafts of moonlight through the trees. His hands are clasped behind his back, and his eyes are fastened to Wei Ying \u2014 to Lan Wangji\u2019s form.</p>\n<p>\u201cZewu-Jun,\u201d Lan Wangji says respectfully, trying to salute while also keeping Wei Ying upright.</p>\n<p>\u201cZewu-Jun,\u201d Wei Ying repeats, clumsily doing the same. Lan Wangji closes his eyes and tries not to sigh through his nose.</p>\n<p>Lan Xichen takes one look at Wei Ying and his nostrils flare. He turns to stare accusingly at Lan Wangji \u2014 with exasperation, not quite angry but his patience clearly tested.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAlcohol?\u201d he says, lips pursed. \u201cI assume this is your doing, Wei-gongzi?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWei Ying did nothing,\u201d Lan Wangji says in an immediate instinct to protect Wei Ying\u2019s reputation, only to realize how stilted and formal the comment sounds coming from Wei Ying\u2019s own mouth.</p>\n<p>Lan Xichen stares at him, then back to Wei Ying, who\u2019s still lilting suspiciously to one side.</p>\n<p>\u201cI...found him like this, in the <em> jingshi,</em>\u201d Lan Wangji says. \u201cI thought I would take him for a walk.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThis behavior is not like Wangji at all,\u201d Lan Xichen murmurs, staring at Wei Ying through his eyebrows with worry. \u201cI fear something must have happened to deeply upset him.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji stays silent; his brother\u2019s concern touches him and discomforts him in equal measure.</p>\n<p>\u201cWei-gongzi is...returning from Cold Spring?\u201d Lan Xichen guesses, taking in the two of them still soaking wet.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d Lan Wangji says, trying to speak as Wei Ying would. \u201cI thought it might \u2014 clear Lan Zhan\u2019s head.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Xichen sighs. \u201cThat was thoughtful of you,\u201d he says.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cMn,\u201d Lan Wangji says, then catches himself and adds, \u201cYes.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Xichen takes a deep breath again, transferring his gaze from his brother to the real Lan Wangji before him. He hesitates, as though carefully picking his words, before he speaks.</p>\n<p>\u201cWei-gongzi,\u201d he says. \u201cI trust you will be mindful of Wangji\u2019s...feelings, in the future. I do not want to see him this way again.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji feels heat itching in his throat. He has never tried to hide his feelings for Wei Ying from his brother, but to know he would speak to Wei Ying about it in such a way is mortifying.</p>\n<p>Wei Ying, of course, chooses that moment to speak up.</p>\n<p>\u201cZewu-Jun,\u201d he says with a wet hiccup. He locks one hand onto Lan Wangji\u2019s elbow. \u201cZewu-Jun, I like your Hanguang-Jun so much. I think I might keep him.\u201d</p>\n<p>Hearing this from his brother, Lan Xichen\u2019s expression of perplexed concern returns at once.</p>\n<p>\u201cWei-gongzi, please take Wangji discreetly to the <em> jingshi,</em>\u201d Lan Xichen says. \u201cAnd please ensure that no one else sees him like this.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji nods, relieved to see the end of this horrible conversation. \u201cOf course, Zewu-Jun. Thank you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI think that went well,\u201d Wei Ying muses, far before they\u2019re out of earshot, and Lan Wangji walks faster, almost dragging Wei Ying behind him in his haste.</p>\n<p>\u201cLan Zhan,\u201d Wei Ying whines at him as Lan Wangji pulls him into the <em> jingshi </em> at last<em>. </em>\u201cDon\u2019t be angry with me, please.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNot angry,\u201d Lan Wangji replies, meaning it.</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you sure? It seems like you\u2019re angry at me. Then again, it always seems like you\u2019re angry at me. You\u2019ve never really liked me much, have you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWei Ying,\u201d Lan Wangji says, both surprised and pained by the question. He has been informed by others, countless times, of his own ambivalence, that his cold exterior is like an impenetrable fortress, but to know Wei Ying thinks his regard for him so low sends a sharp, shooting pain through his chest. He\u2019s upset with himself, incapable as he is of saying and doing as he means.</p>\n<p>\u201cLan Zhan,\u201d Wei Ying murmurs, seeming to sense his sudden inward retreat. He cups one of Lan Wangji\u2019s cheeks, turning his face so they\u2019re closer. \u201cDon\u2019t listen to me when I\u2019m like this, I just say anything. I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m saying. Come to bed with me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji heaves in a breath, his instincts screaming at him to recoil, to shy away from this directness, but he swallows it down. How often has he gotten in his own way, when it comes to what he truly wants?</p>\n<p>Still, he hesitates.</p>\n<p>Then:</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay,\u201d he hears himself say, and Wei Ying\u2019s smile lights up the room.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u2014</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u00a0</p>\n<p>At last, Wei Wuxian thinks, he\u2019s gotten Lan Zhan in bed with him \u2014 although, of course, it\u2019s not quite in the context he wants. And it\u2019s a distinctly less sexy context than his alcoholic alter-ego has been fantasizing about.</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji is as stiff as a board next to him, his spine rigid and his eyes fixed to the ceiling. His hands are clenched to his chest in a facsimile of the Lan sleeping position, and he\u2019s breathing shallowly through his flared nostrils.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s also the unignorable fact that he\u2019s in Wei Wuxian\u2019s own body, which is still too strange to reckon with.</p>\n<p>\u201cLan Zhan,\u201d Wei Wuxian murmurs, still sluggish with the alcohol. It makes his tongue thick in his mouth. \u201cCalm down. I won\u2019t do anything to you. I just wanted someone to lay down with me, okay?\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji looks like he wants to squirm but remains still, a pretty red flush climbing up his neck. Wei Wuxian reaches out a hand, splays his fingers across his chest, where he can feel Lan Wangji\u2019s heartbeat rabbiting frantically against his palm.</p>\n<p>\u201cLan <em> Zhan,</em>\u201d he teases, curling in even closer. \u201cAre you nervous?\u201d</p>\n<p>He watches Lan Wangji\u2019s rigid profile, the way his throat gives a bob and dry click as he swallows. His breathing sounds quicker than before.</p>\n<p>Right, right, Wei Wuxian remembers, somewhat woozy. Lan Zhan and his thing with touching people. He\u2019s not sure they\u2019ve ever been so close for so long; he can feel the solid warmth of Lan Wangji radiating into him.</p>\n<p>The alcohol fogs everything in his brain, everything sensible and rational and responsible \u2014 he leans forward and presses his nose to the side of Lan Wangji\u2019s neck, burying his face in the warm hollow between neck and shoulder. Lan Wangji jerks beneath him, his breath hitching.</p>\n<p>For the first time that Wei Wuxian can recall, Lan Wangji doesn\u2019t smell like his crisp, familiar sandalwood. He smells\u2026earthy, sort of smoky, like the heat from a bonfire. Also sort of cold, from the spring. Is that his own scent?</p>\n<p>\u201cIs this fine?\u201d Wei Wuxian mumbles, closing his eyes. \u201cPlease don\u2019t get up and go. I don\u2019t want to be alone.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a beat of silence, and then Lan Wangji says, low, \u201cI will not leave.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian briefly smiles, wriggling in closer. When he\u2019s sleepy, he latches on to everything in immediate vicinity and clings like his life depends on it \u2014 liquor, it would seem, has much the same effect.\u00a0</p>\n<p><em> Poor Lan Zhan, </em> he thinks as he drifts in and out of consciousness, fading between murky layers of blacks and grays. Forced into his body, forced into closeness with him. He\u2019ll make it up to him one day. He will. He will, he\u2019ll take him back to Yunmeng and buy him something nice, maybe a meal, take him out in a rowboat on the lakes when the day is sunny, put a lotus in his hair\u2026\u00a0</p>\n<p>The next thing he knows, Wei Wuxian is jerking awake into darkness on a stifled scream, his thin inner robe plastered to his skin with cold sweat, his pulse beating a fast, thready staccato into all his limbs. He\u2019s thrashing, fighting, resentment spindling all around him in black-red coils, seeping into his body, his empty core, sucking everything out of him until there\u2019s nothing but desiccated flesh\u2014</p>\n<p>The resentment crowds greedily around the cavity of his empty core; like a rotten tooth torn out from the root, blood filling the space behind.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em> Do you want revenge, Wei Wuxian? Stay.\u00a0 </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em> You can have revenge.\u00a0 </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em> Stay with us. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2014 Wei Ying,\u201d he hears a frantic voice say, close to his ear, and yes, sometimes Lan Zhan had spoken to him there; had reprimanded him, scorned him, spat on him, told him how reviled he was, told him he deserved to die alone, and he knows that, he knows \u2014\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<em> I\u2019m sorry, Lan Zhan, I\u2019m sorry, please, please, please \u2014 </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em> Stay, Wei Wuxian. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em> Stay. </em>\n</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Wei Ying!</em>\u201d Lan Wangji repeats, more sharply than before, and it takes hearing it in Wei Wuxian\u2019s own voice to realize he\u2019s not in the Burial Mounds, not among corpses and seething resentful energy and the screams of the dead. He\u2019s in a bed and a body that aren\u2019t his own, his unfamiliar chest heaving for breath, and Lan Wangji\u2019s fingers are encircled around both of his wrists, where he can feel his heartbeat sickly pounding.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat \u2014\u201d he tries to say, heaves for air.</p>\n<p>\u201cA nightmare,\u201d Lan Wangji says, simply, but the two words are so soft and concerned that it\u2019s strangely grounding.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m s-sorry,\u201d he says, his teeth chattering. He\u2019s so deeply, achingly cold, down to the marrow of his bones, and he\u2019s shivering violently, great shudders racking his frame.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He\u2019s not there, Wei Wuxian tells himself. Just this again. Just another memory. His head still feels strangely woolly with the leftover alcohol, leaving a cottony taste in his mouth.</p>\n<p>\u201cTea,\u201d Lan Wangji says quietly, and goes to move, but Wei Wuxian grips onto his wrist so hard he feels the bones creak.</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d he whispers, not entirely sure what he\u2019s asking for\u2014don\u2019t pity me, please, not you? Don\u2019t be kind to me, when I deserve it least? Don\u2019t leave? He thinks it may be all of them at once.</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji hesitates, his intense gaze scrutinizing, before he gives one nod and settles back into bed, then continues to stare at him. It\u2019s odd seeing that appraising expression in his own eyes; with a sudden, fierce ache, Wei Wuxian misses the cool steadiness of Lan Wangji\u2019s golden gaze, how warm the hues can be when they take him in.</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian can feel Lan Wangji\u2019s core pulsating with energy, activated to the perceived danger. It shakes through him with a strength that has for some time been unfamiliar to him. He takes a deep breath, into his belly, and reigns it in with effort.</p>\n<p>He can feel his brow still dripping with sweat. Lan Wangji reaches out with a sleeve and dabs it away.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry to wake you,\u201d Wei Wuxian whispers, recoiling from the gentleness of the touch. All the moisture in his mouth is gone.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo need,\u201d Lan Wangji replies, just as quiet. \u201cWhat can I do?\u201d</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian drops his head into his hands. \u201cJust\u2026stop looking at me like that. Please.\u201d His skin crawls at the prospect of being pitied, of being seen.</p>\n<p>\u201cMn. No more looking,\u201d Lan Wangji says, in such a serious, considerate voice that Wei Wuxian gives a sniffled, helpless laugh.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cLan Zhan,\u201d he says, before he can stop himself. \u201cI miss seeing you in your body. I miss your face.\u201d Lan Zhan had always felt\u2026big, solid, safe. Wei Wuxian had felt protected near him, no matter what. That, he doesn\u2019t say.</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji says nothing, but Wei Wuxian thinks he hears him inhale, sharp and quiet.</p>\n<p>\u201cLan Zhan,\u201d he says again, his voice hushed. \u201cYou\u2019re a good person, you know that?\u201d</p>\n<p>Again, Lan Wangji says nothing.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry I tease you so much,\u201d Wei Wuxian continues. \u201cIt\u2019s just that I\u2026\u201d <em>Like you so much I can\u2019t stop myself. </em>That, he also doesn\u2019t say. He\u2019d never dare. Even thinking it tears through him, brazen.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cStop apologizing,\u201d Lan Wangji says, firm and terse. \u201cBetween us, there\u2019s no need.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Wei Wuxian says, and exhales shakily.</p>\n<p>\u201cWei Ying.\" Lan Wangji hesitates again, gauging Wei Wuxian\u2019s expression. \u201cYou dreamt of the Burial Mounds?\u201d</p>\n<p>This time, Wei Wuxian doesn\u2019t answer, unsure that he\u2019s able to. He\u2019s suddenly terrified to think what his unconscious self had spoken, with Lan Wangji\u2019s mouth.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not important,\u201d Wei Wuxian says, and Lan Wangji makes an impatient noise.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis happens often?\u201d he presses.</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian doesn\u2019t say anything to that. He\u2019s certain that his silence confirms it, as well as the fact that he starts shivering violently again.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cLay down,\u201d Lan Wangji says abruptly, and after a moment of hesitation, Wei Wuxian does as he\u2019s told, too tired to make any weak quips or innuendos about Lan Wangji bossing him around in bed.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s shocked to feel Lan Wangji turn him by the shoulders, his back to Lan Wangji\u2019s front, despite Lan Wangji\u2019s currently smaller frame.</p>\n<p>He hears Lan Wangji take a deep breath, and then tentative, warm arms pull him in, flush to the body behind him.</p>\n<p>\u201cLan Zhan,\u201d Wei Wuxian says, stiffening despite the way his own body wilts welcomingly into the warmth. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to touch me, I wouldn\u2019t force you to \u2014\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNot forcing,\u201d Lan Wangji says, so close to his ear that heat zips up his spine. Wei Wuxian\u2019s mouth dries out even more, if possible, chalky as desert sand. He\u2019s still shivering with the cold, but warmth from Lan Wangji\u2019s body heat creeps slowly into him, and he sighs.</p>\n<p>\u201cSleep, Wei Ying,\u201d Lan Wangji whispers, and Wei Wuxian fights against the tide of exhaustion that threatens to tug him under. He wants to stay awake for this, to stay awake for Lan Zhan holding him like this, as he never will again, and he thinks he feels Lan Wangji\u2019s face pressed, ever so lightly, into the base of his neck, but surely he\u2019s already dreaming \u2014 surely he dreams it.</p>\n<p>When Wei Wuxian wakes up the next morning, with an awful, dark headache clustering around his temples, the bed is empty.\u00a0</p>\n<p>For a moment, he blinks into the painful, white morning light of the <em> jingshi </em>and lets his head pound as though in punishment, blood pulsing thickly against his skull. Wasn\u2019t Lan Zhan here before? He\u2019d had a nightmare \u2014 he was drunk?</p>\n<p>When he shifts, floundering about for his bearings, a jolt of arousal zings through him, hard and insistent. Sighing, his hand drops to his lap to quickly take care of it, as he usually does when he wakes up like this, but his hand freezes at once.\u00a0</p>\n<p>It\u2019s not his hand; it\u2019s not his clothes, and it\u2019s <em> certainly </em>not \u2014</p>\n<p>In one hot, mortifying swoop, the past few days rush back to him; the soul-switch, the scars and the drinking. He can feel heat climbing to his face, which doesn\u2019t do anything to help the arousal situation \u2014 in fact, imagining being in Lan Wangji\u2019s body, doing intimate physical things, is rapidly escalating the situation.</p>\n<p>His hand lingers, staring down in complete bafflement at the tented shape pushing at the front of Lan Wangji\u2019s trousers.</p>\n<p>And just keeps staring. <em> Big, </em>is the only thing his dumb, hormone-addled brain can summon at the moment.</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian covers his burning face with his hands.</p>\n<p>...he <em> can\u2019t</em>, right? Does Lan Wangji even know how to do that? <em> Has </em> he ever done it before? No, he could never do that to Lan Zhan \u2014 he would feel horrible all his life for taking advantage of such a situation.</p>\n<p>But still \u2014</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian groans and flips over, his hips canting up once, twice into the mattress. He\u2019s throbbing all over, his face splotchy with heat like a rash. This needs to go away, <em> now, </em>before Lan Wangji gets back here and bursts an artery. He thinks of various unpleasantries \u2014 old toe gunk, Jiang Cheng\u2019s smelly armpits, Jin Zixuan\u2019s face, Lan Qiren naked.</p>\n<p><em>This is fine,</em> Wei Wuxian thinks, as the arousal slowly, reluctantly starts to recede. It\u2019s just bodies, as he told Lan Wangji earlier. He\u2019d be okay with it if Lan Wangji woke up in a similar situation, although he admits the thought does make him feel even more hot all over.</p>\n<p>Cold Spring, Wei Wuxian thinks, would be perfect for this. Is that why Lan Wangji had spent so much time there early on in their days at Cloud Recesses? It seems like a good place for the Lans to suppress any wayward, raging hormones.</p>\n<p>Cold Spring...had they gone there, last night? He thinks they must have, given the dirt from his skin is gone. His memory of the night is a void, as though he\u2019d been asleep for it. What did he say\u00a0\u2014 what did he <em> do</em>? It feels absolutely horrible to be on the other end of this, Wei Wuxian realizes, feeling bad for Lan Zhan in a way he hadn\u2019t appreciated before.</p>\n<p>The dread from this train of thought kills most of the arousal issue, although not completely. Wei Wuxian buries his warm face in a pillow, guilt gnawing away at him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji is just so... reserved, prudish, stoic, that it feels especially wrong to even be thinking about such things. Lan Zhan had barely been able to undress around Wei Wuxian without passing out; he\u2019s already repulsed to be in Wei Wuxian\u2019s body. The thought of his reaction to this makes Wei Wuxian feel awful and ashamed, even though it hadn\u2019t technically been his fault.</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji <em> had </em> held him last night, hadn\u2019t he? He thinks back to the warm, comforting press of Lan Zhan curled up around him and thinks that, actually, this whole thing may be <em> his </em> fault, and he should answer for it.</p>\n<p>\u201cWei Ying,\u201d Lan Wangji says from the entryway, as though summoned, and Wei Wuxian almost jumps out of his skin.</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian flips himself over and nestles himself down into the sheets more securely, just to be safe. \u201cLan Zhan! Wow, you look handsome this morning.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji visibly suppresses an eye-roll at this, crossing over to him with his hands behind his back. His guqin is strapped to his shoulders, which looks...strange, to say the least, on Wei Wuxian\u2019s body.</p>\n<p>\u201cDid you, ah, sleep okay?\u201d Wei Wuxian asks, his voice pitched higher in his nervousness. He tries to look natural, levering himself up onto his elbows.</p>\n<p>\u201cMn,\u201d Lan Wangji says. His gray eyes are clear and piercing, like frozen water as they take in Wei Wuxian. \u201cAnd you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI slept fine,\u201d Wei Wuxian lies.</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji clearly doesn\u2019t believe him, but lets it go. He smoothly transitions subjects. \u201cI spoke to xiongzhang just now. After my explanation, he believes he may be familiar with the curse.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian sits up straighter in bed, his focus completely redirected. \u201cHe does? What did he say? Does he know how to fix it?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe believes the curse is one called <em> Linghun-jiaohuan</em>. He has heard many in the area call the monster by the same name, and we are evidently not its first victims,\u201d Lan Wangji says. \u201cXiongzhang has suggested that if we can track and kill the creature, we will return to normal.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAh, a monster with at least some intelligence, like the Tusha Xuanwu. As I suspected.\u201d Wei Wuxian pauses, rubs at a spot on his chin, and then smiles. \u201cI bet Zewu-Jun was pretty confused when you showed up in my body this morning.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji\u2019s expression doesn\u2019t change except for a small tilt of his mouth; it\u2019s the ghost of a smile, which Wei Wuxian tucks away into his memory bank with a small rush of triumph. \u201cLet\u2019s say that after last night, it did not take long to convince him of the situation.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian laughs at that, then lightly punches Lan Wangji\u2019s shoulder. \u201cWho ever said you weren\u2019t funny, Lan Zhan? You\u2019re a master of wit.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji looks at him wryly, but Wei Wuxian thinks he can detect something warm and fond in his gaze, and his insides start to feel all dangerously gooey. He beams at him.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe should go to Cold Spring to bathe and meditate,\u201d Lan Wangji says then, rising from the bed, and Wei Wuxian remembers his earlier predicament at once and feels new dread swell up in him. Of course, <em> now </em>Lan Wangji is on board with flagrant stripping.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the rush?\u201d Wei Wuxian parries with a nervous laugh. \u201cI mean, we just went last night, didn\u2019t we? I only just woke up.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou smell like liquor,\u201d Lan Wangji says, curtly. \u201cAlcohol is forbidden in the Cloud Recesses.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cRight, right,\u201d Wei Wuxian mutters. \u201cAh, I\u2019m sorry for any of my conduct last night, Lan Zhan. Alcohol <em> really </em> does hit you like a runaway boulder. I\u2019ll be more careful from now on.\u201d The fact that they had encountered Zewu-Jun is news to him. That he can\u2019t remember it at all feels incredibly ominous. \u201cI didn\u2019t, ah...<em>do </em>anything to you, right?\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji blinks at him for a moment. His silence is not promising.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d he eventually says, with such hesitation that it does little to restore Wei Wuxian\u2019s confidence. \u201cWei Ying did not do anything.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s just that I\u2026\u201d Wei Ying scratches the back of his head. \u201cSometimes, when I have too much to drink, I\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWei Ying,\u201d Lan Wangji says. \u201cIt is fine. And if you had misbehaved, it would be forgiven.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDid I embarrass you in front of Zewu-Jun?\u201d Wei Wuxian asks; he still feels vaguely guilty, as though he subconsciously knows he did something inappropriate and needs to apologize for it.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo more so than you usually do,\u201d says Lan Wangji with a straight face, and Wei Wuxian snorts.</p>\n<p>Still, if they really had gone to Cold Spring...Wei Wuxian does not trust himself with alcohol and an undressed Lan Zhan even a little bit.</p>\n<p>\u201cIf you say so,\u201d he says, still feeling uneasy.</p>\n<p>\u201cI do,\u201d Lan Wangji replies. \u201cCold Spring?\u201d</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian hesitates, then nods; to tell the truth, he <em> does </em>feel pretty gamey. He had sweated through most of the night thanks to the liquor and the nightmares, and his head and mouth feel fuzzy with the hangover. The cold water could do him well.</p>\n<p>Sternly, he tells Lan Wangji\u2019s lap, <em> Behave, </em>then he gets to his feet, and groans when all his headache pounds in protest at the change of elevation.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m never drinking again,\u201d he mutters, closing his eyes against the throbbing pain.</p>\n<p>\u201cMark your words,\u201d says Lan Wangji.</p>\n<p>\u201cThree jokes in one morning, Hanguang-Jun!\u201d Wei Wuxian is delighted. Lan Zhan being a secret wit is delightful. He\u2019d realized some time ago that the droll, rigid impression he had of Lan Wangji from their first days wasn\u2019t entirely correct \u2014 well, it was in part, but now he looks back on those qualities with fondness, now that he understands Lan Wangji more. But the more layers Wei Wuxian knows of him, the more he...</p>\n<p>They\u2019re interrupted by a sudden patter of running footsteps, and then two fast knocks at the door.</p>\n<p>\u201cLan er-gongzi,\u201d Jiang Cheng says, not bothering to salute, then double-takes and gawks when he sees Wei Wuxian, mostly undressed and directly behind him. \u201c<em>You</em>! I\u2019ve been looking for you! What are you doing in Lan Wangji\u2019s \u2014\u201d Jiang Cheng seems to think better of the question, then closes his eyes as though summoning peace of mind from somewhere deep within. \u201cI actually don\u2019t want to know.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIs there something I can help you with, Jiang-zongzhu?\u201d Lan Wangji says, sounding more martyred than he has any right to.</p>\n<p>Jiang Cheng scoffs at his tone. \u201c<em>I </em> came to help <em> you, </em> not that I\u2019ll get any thanks for it.<em>\u00a0</em>This morning\u2019s patrol found traces of the creature. By its tracks, they think it\u2019s headed toward Caiyi Town.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian brightens at once, and he starts to sloppily (and almost definitely incorrectly) throw on various layers of white clothes while Jiang Cheng looks on in abject horror.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWe should go right away,\u201d he says as he flings robes on. \u201cJiang Cheng can lead the way.\u201d</p>\n<p>The second he\u2019s finished, Wei Wuxian darts out the door, grabbing Lan Wangji\u2019s wrist as he goes.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re forgetting something,\u201d Lan Wangji says behind him.</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian flips a frown over his shoulder. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBichen?\u201d Lan Wangji asks, patient as ever, one eyebrow slightly aloft.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, right, right, right.\u201d Wei Wuxian ducks back inside the <em> jingshi </em>to pick it up from the bedside, as well as Chenqing while Jiang Cheng shuffles restlessly from foot to foot outside.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd you\u2019ll need this,\u201d Wei Wuxian says with a wide grin, patting Chenqing to Lan Wangji\u2019s chest with a thump.</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji just looks at him with a small, pinched frown, and gives Chenqing back to him.</p>\n<p>\u201cFine. What about your guqin?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAlmost useless, without\u2026\u201d Lan Wangji\u2019s voice trails off.</p>\n<p>\u201cRight, right. Well, you can take Suibian for insurance if you want, although I think it\u2019ll <em> also </em> be mostly useless to you given\u2014\u201d Wei Wuxian catches himself before his next words, and then flinches as Jiang Cheng turns toward him in his periphery.</p>\n<p>\u201cCan you two hurry up?\u201d Jiang Cheng snaps, blessedly seeming to notice nothing amiss. \u201cThe creature\u2019s not going to lie around and wait for us to kill it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re right, Jiang Cheng,\u201d Wei Wuxian says, magnanimous in his relief for having gotten away with that near-misstep. \u201cWe\u2019d be lost without you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou smell ungodly,\u201d says Jiang Cheng, and they set out.</p>\n<p>Once they reach the border of Cloud Recesses, Jiang Cheng sets Sandu on the ground, then stands on top of it. After a moment, it begins to levitate, hovering close to the ground. He looks impatiently over to Wei Wuxian, who has frozen in place.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell?\u201d Jiang Cheng says, testy. \u201cCaiyi Town is more than sixty li from here. Surely you\u2019re not expecting to walk all the way there?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course not.\u201d Wei Wuxian swallows. \u201cIt\u2019s just that \u2014 Lan Zhan and I, we don\u2019t have our own swords.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo what? Use Bichen. Hanguang-Jun can make do with Suibian for now.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji slants a look sideways at Wei Wuxian, as though appraising how he wants to approach the situation. Obviously, given Wei Wuxian\u2019s complete dearth of spiritual power, Lan Wangji can\u2019t do anything at all with Suibian, let alone ride it.</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian sighs, thickens his face, and looks solemnly at his brother. \u201cI want Lan Zhan to ride with me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jiang Cheng splutters, nearly falling off his sword. \u201c<em>What</em>? What the hell do you mean?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI won\u2019t feel safe unless he\u2019s on Bichen with me,\u201d Wei Wuxian says, still in that deathly serious tone of voice, while Jiang Cheng slowly starts to turn a bright shade of cherry-red. It compliments the hue of his clothes rather nicely.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re joking, right? Please tell me you\u2019re joking. Did that curse knock your brain out of your head?\u201d</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian makes a show of gripping onto Lan Wangji\u2019s arm, then clinging to his side. He hears Lan Wangji take a breath, then hold it. \u201cI only feel comfortable riding Hanguang-Jun\u2019s sword if he\u2019s holding onto me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jiang Cheng covers his ears and groans. \u201cEnough, enough. Do what you want, don\u2019t involve me. Ugh.\u201d He righteously flies away.</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian grins, tilting his head down to meet Lan Wangji\u2019s gaze. \u201cI think I handled that well.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji just sighs, gently shaking his arm from Wei Wuxian\u2019s grasp, and goes to stand in front of him, their feet aligned on Bichen.</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian takes a breath to steady himself, then his arms snake around Lan Wangji\u2019s waist, pressing the lines of their bodies together. Some small, treacherous part of him voices how nice the position would be in their real bodies; how secure and warm he\u2019d feel, with Lan Zhan in such a position behind him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji tenses for a moment at the contact, then relaxes.</p>\n<p>\u201cHold onto me, Hanguang-Jun,\u201d Wei Wuxian says, close to his ear. \u201cDon\u2019t let me fall, okay?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWill not,\u201d Lan Wangji agrees, tightening his grip on where Wei Wuxian\u2019s arms are wrapped around him, and with another intake of breath, Wei Wuxian guides them upward, siphoning off Lan Wangji\u2019s spiritual power to do so.</p>\n<p>By sword, it doesn\u2019t take them long at all to reach the forested outskirts of Caiyi, removed from the teeming bustle of the town. Wei Wuxian follows the lead of Jiang Cheng, who\u2019s maintaining an indignant distance from them. Jiang Cheng eventually directs them down into a more heavily wooded area, where they land and sheath their swords.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo what exactly is this thing?\u201d Jiang Cheng asks as they start walking.</p>\n<p>\u201cHmm...not entirely sure,\u201d Wei Wuxian says. \u201cI would say it\u2019s non-human, which would make it a monster, but a cognizant one, with real intelligence. My guess is that the creature is either itinerant or some poor soul awoke it accidentally, as the incidents are so recent. We know that it feeds on human flesh, whether dead or alive.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jiang Cheng wrinkles his nose. \u201cWhat will get rid of the curse?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cZewu-Jun thinks that killing it will,\u201d Wei Wuxian says. \u201cI agree with him. Once the monster is dead, its power over the spiritual energy of the physical world will vanish.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIf you say so,\u201d Jiang Cheng mutters.</p>\n<p>\u201cI do say so,\u201d Wei Wuxian replies sunnily.</p>\n<p>\u201cTracks,\u201d Lan Wangji says, diverting their attention. There are, indeed, large scrapes of tracks nearby, scored into the earth in long, dragging shapes. Certainly not human, or from any animal that Wei Wuxian is familiar with.</p>\n<p>The trail leads the three of them into a denser part of the trees, darker and cooler as the leaves overhead crowd out the white glare of the midday sun. Wei Wuxian sticks close to Lan Wangji\u2019s side, keeping his hand firmly planted on Bichen\u2019s hilt.</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji holds up a hand to stop them as he kneels in the dirt. Wei Wuxian hesitates, the pad of his thumb stroking over the white engravings in Bichen\u2019s hilt.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe tracks stop here,\u201d Lan Wangji murmurs after another few moments of searching.</p>\n<p>\u201cHow can they?\u201d Jiang Cheng demands. \u201cIt can\u2019t have just disappeared into the air.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMaybe it knows we\u2019re following it,\u201d Wei Wuxian suggests. \u201cIts sense of smell is probably keen.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cStay close to me,\u201d Lan Wangji tells him quietly.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s at that moment that a familiar screech rings out, and the three of them clap their hands over their ears in pain. Wei Wuxian recognizes the sound as the same scream he\u2019d heard in the cave, right before he and Lan Wangji had been cursed.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s the sound of bark scrabbling, and then the creature lands in front of them, snarling.</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course it climbs trees,\u201d Jiang Cheng snaps, unsheathing Sandu.</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian stares at the creature, trying to comprehend exactly what he\u2019s seeing. He hadn\u2019t gotten a good look at it before, as the cave had been so dark and both he and Lan Zhan had been blinded.\u00a0</p>\n<p>It looks...like somewhat humanesque in shape, but it walks naked on all fours, its limbs spindly and long and the flesh graying and peeling. Its teeth have been filed into yellow points, each separated by rotting gums; its fingernails have long been warped into gnarled claws. It has no eyes, and the skin drawn over the sockets is puckered.</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian feels Jiang Cheng yank on his arm, hauling him away from both the creature and from Lan Wangji\u2019s side.</p>\n<p>Although the creature has no nose, it has slits for nostrils, which flare as it turns its head toward Lan Wangji and snarls.</p>\n<p>When Wei Wuxian looks over to him, Lan Wangji\u2019s expression is hardened with concentration, his mouth drawn into a tight line. He throws two talismans, but they do little to distract the monster. It rears back, hissing and spitting, while Lan Wangji unsheathes Suibian, but Wei Wuxian can tell even from here that without a core, it will have little effect.</p>\n<p>\u201cLan Zhan!\u201d he calls, unsheathing Bichen. He feels power arc through his limbs at the contact, crackling through him as cold as frost. \u201cGet behind me!\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji looks to the sound of his voice for only a moment, but the lapse is all the monster needs to spring, locking its claws into Lan Wangji\u2019s shoulder and slamming him to the ground.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Then it takes off at a dead sprint, dragging Lan Wangji with it.</p>\n<p>The world goes white around Wei Wuxian, narrowing to a singular focus.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Lan Zhan!</em>\u201d Wei Wuxian takes off after them, ignoring Jiang Cheng\u2019s cry behind him of \u201cWei Wuxian!\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji\u2019s legs are longer than his own, but he\u2019s not as lithe or compact as Wei Wuxian, who had come first in every race among his peers at Lotus Pier. He\u2019s barely caught up in time to see the creature dragging Lan Wangji down into a hole in the large, twisted roots of a tree, both vanishing from view.</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian skids to a stop at the hole and stares down into it, panting, his heart crashing with panic. Lan Wangji is completely defenseless in his stupid, broken, helpless body. If anything happens to him \u2014 if anything happens to him \u2014</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian sheathes Bichen so he can shimmy down the hole, which it turns out is the creviced entryway to an underground cave. The entrance is slick with mud, chafing around him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He can hear the echoes of the creature snarling, but nothing from Lan Wangji which \u2014 it\u2019s not like Lan Zhan makes a lot of noise anyway, but Wei Wuxian is still panicking.</p>\n<p>The drop from the hole to the cave floor is about three chi. He lands easily on his feet, but starts shaking when he sees blood coating the rock beneath his white shoes. If Lan Wangji had landed wrong from that height, he could be unconscious, he could be dead \u2014</p>\n<p>He strikes up a lighting talisman and the creature, not ten strides away, snarls and skitters back. Hadn\u2019t he thought it was intelligent? It acts completely feral, like a mindless animal.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian\u2019s \u2014 <em>Lan Zhan's \u2014 </em>body is a black, crumpled shape next to it, and Wei Wuxian suddenly has trouble seeing, a red aura of rage clouding the corners of his vision.</p>\n<p>He unsheathes Bichen and a ray of blue light slices out from the blade, sharp as the cut of a guqin string, and the monster screams, cowering away from the brilliance of the light and the pain. It growls at him, spittle flying.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou should not have taken what isn\u2019t yours,\u201d Wei Wuxian snarls back at it, and then begins to whistle, the sound pitching high and eerie in the echo of the cave. At once, shadows unspool around him, curling up his body with familiar affection before they turn with the sharpness of a knife, pinpointing the creature.</p>\n<p>The shadows spring at Wei Wuxian\u2019s command almost too quickly to see, entangling the monster in a black cloud of writhing beings, and the creature starts to scream \u2014 high-pitched, pathetic, desperate shrieking as they tear at its flesh.</p>\n<p>With the creature at last subdued, Wei Wuxian throws Bichen the way he\u2019s seen Lan Wangji do, with a sure target in mind and with the certainty that it will come spinning back to him.</p>\n<p>His aim is true; the blade pierces the monster straight through the heart, and it gurgles and slumps, its mouth dribbling blood and drool.</p>\n<p>The shadows dissolve back into the earth as Wei Wuxian slumps with sudden fatigue. Belatedly, he realizes Lan Wangji may not forgive him for using his core to practice dark cultivation, but he can worry about that later \u2014 for now, he runs to Lan Wangji\u2019s side and falls on his knees beside him.</p>\n<p>He barely touches Lan Wangji before a blinding flash envelops both of them, the same as before, and Wei Wuxian feels the oddest sense of getting yanked around and twisted, like getting caught and spat up in a riptide. He doesn\u2019t know which way is up from down, and he can\u2019t breathe, like he really <em> is </em>drowning \u2014</p>\n<p>\u2014 and then he\u2019s blinking up at Lan Wangji, who\u2019s hovering over him and looking down at him with a dazed expression.</p>\n<p>\u201cWei Ying,\u201d he says in his low, beautiful voice, and despite the twist of pain in his shoulder, Wei Wuxian reaches up and pulls him down against him. Lan Wangji huffs in surprise when their bodies slam together.</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t ever do that to me again,\u201d Wei Wuxian says through gasps, pulling back, and he can\u2019t stop himself from grabbing Lan Wangji\u2019s handsome, precious face and kissing him once, hard, on the cheek, and then on the nose.</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji stares down at him, his mouth slightly parted.</p>\n<p>\u201cI,\u201d he tries to say, then nothing further.</p>\n<p>\u201cI saw you lying there and the blood and I thought \u2014 I thought you were dead,\u201d Wei Wuxian chokes out, still heaving for air. All of the spiritual power that had poured through him moments before is gone; he\u2019s bereft again, returned to his old familiar creaks and aches. And a brand new bloody wound on his shoulder, another scar for the collection.</p>\n<p>\u201cPretending to be,\u201d Lan Wangji explains. \u201cTo catch it off guard, kill it then.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian closes his eyes, trying to just <em> breathe </em>for a moment. Trying to catch up with having his soul sucked out and crammed back into a different vessel, with the fact that Lan Wangji is alive and uninjured.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re hurt,\u201d Lan Wangji rasps, and he cups one hand to Wei Wuxian\u2019s shoulder.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Wei Wuxian agrees.</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji\u2019s face darkens. \u201cMy fault.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Wei Wuxian disagrees.</p>\n<p>\u201cWei Wuxian!\u201d Jiang Cheng\u2019s voice rings out in the cave, echoing loudly. \u201c<em>Wei Wuxian!</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m alive,\u201d Wei Wuxian calls back, and he hears Jiang Cheng curse.\u00a0</p>\n<p>A moment later, a single purple leg appears through the hole in the cave ceiling, to which Wei Wuxian exclaims, \u201cAiya, stay right there! We\u2019ll need your help getting up out of here.\u201d</p>\n<p>The leg hesitates, then disappears again.</p>\n<p>\u201cCan you walk?\u201d Lan Wangji asks, running his hand up Wei Wuxian\u2019s side like it\u2019s the most casual thing in the world, and Wei Wuxian tries very, very hard not to think too much into it.</p>\n<p>\u201cWon\u2019t know until I try,\u201d he says with a grunt and a wince. \u201cHelp me up?\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji stands, sheathes Bichen, and pulls Wei Wuxian up by the other arm.</p>\n<p>They manage to get Wei Wuxian out of the cave with some careful negotiating, which involves Wei Wuxian clambering up until he\u2019s seated on the top of Lan Wangji\u2019s strong shoulders so that he\u2019s tall enough for Jiang Cheng to grab his good arm and haul him up.</p>\n<p>Jiang Cheng and Wei Wuxian peer back down into the hole, where Lan Wangji\u2019s face tilts up at them, smooth and expressionless.</p>\n<p>\u201cI could leave him down there,\u201d Jiang Cheng muses to himself, and Wei Wuxian uses his same good arm to smack him. \u201c<em>Ow! </em>Ugh, you\u2019re so sensitive these days.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPull him up before I beat you up,\u201d Wei Wuxian threatens, and Jiang Cheng sneers at him and retorts, \u201cAs if you could,\u201d but reluctantly extends an arm down into the hole anyway.</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji is covered from head to toe in dark mud when he emerges, his silken white robes ruined beyond repair \u2014 which is weirdly hot \u2014 and he doesn\u2019t spare Jiang Cheng a thanks, which is very rude, especially for Lan Wangji standards. Lan Zhan being an asshole is <em> also </em>kind of hot.</p>\n<p>Wordlessly, Lan Wangji crosses over to Wei Wuxian and picks him up, one hand to the back of his knees and the other securely locked around his waist. Wei Wuxian settles more comfortably into his arms and ducks his head to hide his grin, as well as the blush he can feel starting to warm his cheeks.</p>\n<p>Without a second glance at Jiang Cheng, Lan Wangji starts off in the direction of Cloud Recesses.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure all of <em> that </em>is necessary, Lan er-gongzi,\u201d Jiang Cheng calls after them, exasperated.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s completely necessary,\u201d Wei Wuxian says, glowering back at Jiang Cheng around Lan Wangji\u2019s shoulder as he clings. \u201cI\u2019m an invalid.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou can <em> walk,</em>\u201d Jiang Cheng says, at his wit\u2019s end. \u201cYou are so perfectly capable of walking.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMy legs are numb,\u201d Wei Wuxian protests, and Jiang Cheng storms after them, muttering this and that about fraternal regard.</p>\n<p>Whether it\u2019s the wound, the soul-switch, or the comedown from the fight, Wei Wuxian does genuinely start to feel woozy halfway back, drifting in and out of a doze. Lan Wangji\u2019s steps don\u2019t falter for a moment; he keeps up an easy clip, his breaths effortless.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019d really lose face if someone saw me like this, you know,\u201d Wei Wuxian mumbles into Lan Wangji\u2019s chest.</p>\n<p>\u201cMn,\u201d Lan Wangji says, but says it more like he\u2019s placating Wei Wuxian and doesn\u2019t actually care.</p>\n<p>\u201cLan Zhan,\u201d he says, his eyes drifting shut. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I used your core for crafty tricks. I wouldn\u2019t have done it if I had any other choice, okay?\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji hesitates, then replies, \u201cIt is fine, because it is Wei Ying.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian closes his eyes and rests his temple against Lan Wangji\u2019s chest. His steady heartbeat, the slightly uneven cadence of his steps beneath Wei Wuxian \u2014 it's comforting, like the rocking of a boat on the waves.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI really should walk,\u201d he murmurs to himself, with absolutely no intention of doing so, and the next thing he knows, he\u2019s back in the <em> jingshi, </em>blinking as Lan Wangji sets him down with gentle motions.</p>\n<p>Jiang Cheng hovers like a dark cloud in the doorway, scowling at them. Lan Wangji does nothing to invite him in, so Jiang Cheng just watches them with an air of angry uncertainty, his jaw working.</p>\n<p>\u201cI guess I\u2019ll just go, then,\u201d he says bitterly. \u201cYou\u2019re welcome, I guess.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHey, Jiang Cheng,\u201d Wei Wuxian says. \u201cDon\u2019t go, okay? Thanks for your help today, really. It means a lot that you were there.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhatever,\u201d Jiang Cheng says, but the hard edge to his expression eases. Suddenly, looking at Lan Wangji, it returns, and twists. \u201cI\u2019d offer to look at your shoulder, but Hanguang-Jun might bite me if I try.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cJiang-zongzhu,\u201d Lan Wangji says, toneless, but it sounds like a warning.</p>\n<p>\u201cAren\u2019t you tired of cleaning up all of your brother\u2019s scrapes, Jiang Cheng?\u201d Wei Wuxian asks genially, in a feeble attempt at peacekeeping. \u201cYou\u2019ve had a lifetime of it by now. Don\u2019t worry about me. Hanguang-Jun has his guqin; I\u2019ll be better in no time.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSure,\u201d Jiang Cheng scoffs, and leaves. Wei Wuxian stares after him, biting down on his lip and feeling guilty.</p>\n<p>\u201cSince when do you two dislike each other so much?\u201d Wei Wuxian wonders aloud. \u201cDid I miss something?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt is Wei Ying who should be tired,\u201d Lan Wangji says.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOf cleaning up his brother\u2019s scrapes.\u201d Lan Wangji\u2019s golden eyes search his; not reproachful, but something softer than it. More like regret.</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian\u2019s skin prickles at the reference, suddenly uncomfortable. \u201cWe\u2019re brothers, Lan Zhan. You would do the same for Zewu-Jun. We don\u2019t tally or keep score. I cover him, he covers me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMn,\u201d Lan Wangji says, sounding like he disagrees. Only Lan Zhan could infuse one syllable with a universe of various inflections.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou can\u2019t resent him for a choice that I made,\u201d Wei Wuxian points out. \u201cA choice I made very willingly and which he has no knowledge of.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji sighs through his nose, and seems like he wants to say more on the subject, but the wince on Wei Wuxian\u2019s face stops the conversation in its tracks, and he says, sternly, \u201cSit.\u201d</p>\n<p>Too worn to argue, Wei Wuxian sits, and closes his eyes, and for a moment just remains like that. He leans into his own heartbeat, his familiar muscles and bones, and finds that despite the gaping absence of his core (which he\u2019s not sure will ever feel normal), he\u2019s glad to be back in his body. It\u2019s battered and powerless and riddled with scars, but it\u2019s a home to him.</p>\n<p>The silence in the room feels strange and billowing, with none of Wei Wuxian\u2019s teasing chatter to fill it for once \u2014 in the past, he\u2019s found that he usually can\u2019t let himself just sit wordlessly with another person. Something in him always itches to fill space with presence. But he doesn\u2019t feel that same pressure with Lan Zhan, as Lan Wangji putters quietly around the room, fetching some herbs and bandages from a drawer, a wet cloth.</p>\n<p>He feels a cool rush of air as Lan Wangji settles beside him, rock-steady, and says, \u201cWei Ying.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMn,\u201d Wei Wuxian murmurs, not opening his eyes.</p>\n<p>\u201cHow do you feel?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGood,\u201d Wei Wuxian says, and is surprised to find he means it. \u201cI feel okay.\u201d</p>\n<p>When he opens his eyes, Lan Wangji is staring at him with an expression that Wei Wuxian doesn\u2019t know how to name, but it makes a strange hunger cavern out inside of him. The candlelight flickers with the breeze from the open windows, and in the low, warm glow, Lan Wangji\u2019s eyes burn like embers. He\u2019s so beautiful that Wei Wuxian hears himself take a hitched, unsteady breath.</p>\n<p>\u201cYour wound,\u201d Lan Wangji eventually says, and Wei Wuxian realizes he\u2019d been waiting for his permission to begin.</p>\n<p>\u201cAh,\u201d he says, feeling stupid. \u201cRight.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian unbuckles his belt so that his top layers loosen, and with some grimaced struggling, he shrugs his injured shoulder out of his clothes. The scrapes and puncture wounds are marked almost behind the upper bridge of his shoulder, so he has to twist his head to examine it. Clots of dry blood are caked and crusted all along his skin, but it doesn\u2019t look too serious.</p>\n<p>\u201cI think it just bled a lot,\u201d Wei Wuxian says. \u201cIt looks pretty shallow to me.\u201d</p>\n<p>He could probably attempt to clean it on his own, but it\u2019s at an awkward enough angle that it would be far easier for someone else to.</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji extends one uncertain hand with the cloth, and then hesitates.</p>\n<p>\u201cMay I\u2026\u201d he starts, then swallows. His ears are pink, Wei Wuxian notices with weary fondness.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou can touch me,\u201d he replies, trying to keep the amusement from his voice so Lan Zhan won\u2019t think he\u2019s being teased. He had spent most of his youth in Yunmeng tearing around half-clothed with a gaggle of boys his age, so to see the Lans get so flustered over a bit of exposed skin is still a funny novelty to him.</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji nods and moves behind him, hesitating a moment more before the wet cloth touches his skin. The friction stings a little, but mostly, it feels good to have the congealed blood off of him, so he closes his eyes, rocking his shoulder lightly into Lan Wangji\u2019s steady ministrations.</p>\n<p>\u201cDoes it hurt?\u201d Lan Wangji asks quietly, and oh, he\u2019s closer than Wei Wuxian thought. He feels a tingle at the base of his neck, and he squirms a bit in place.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Wei Wuxian answers. \u201cI\u2019m tougher than I look, Lan Zhan. I won\u2019t break so easily.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI know,\u201d Lan Wangji murmurs, and <em> this, </em>for some reason, is what makes a zing of heat circuit through Wei Wuxian.\u00a0</p>\n<p>For a minute, he thinks he feels Lan Wangji\u2019s fingertips brush against the nape of his neck, but maybe it\u2019s just the goosebumps prickling his skin. He suddenly realizes that he\u2019s on edge, but not in a tense way, more in the sense that \u2014 he\u2019s hyper-aware of Lan Wangji\u2019s every movement, his every breath. The sensation is taut, electric, like the gathering, building hum of a summer storm.</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji presses some medicine into the wound, which does draw a quiet hiss from Wei Wuxian, before he begins wrapping his shoulder with a nimble expertise that somehow surprises him, as if Lan Wangji isn\u2019t proficient at literally everything he does.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo gentle, Lan er-gege,\u201d he murmurs, the endearment slipping from him before he can stop himself, and he knows it was the wrong thing to say by the way Lan Wangji stiffens slightly behind him, the relaxed ease between them suddenly tightening.\u00a0</p>\n<p>To cover for it, he layers on some desperate flirting. \u201cNow that I\u2019ve wielded Bichen for myself, I know the strength in those hands. Thank you for going easy on me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji steps away.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou can bathe here,\u201d he says a moment later. \u201cIn the adjoining room. I\u2019ll have hot water brought in.\u201d</p>\n<p>A warm bath, after a few days without one and the day he\u2019s had, sounds absolutely heavenly. He shrugs his robe back on and thanks Lan Zhan for his help, and Lan Wangji nods and steps away, giving him some privacy as he goes to prepare.</p>\n<p>When he does bathe, Wei Wuxian is careful not to get his fresh bandages wet, lowering himself with a soft moan into the warm water. Chunks of dirt and dust slough off his skin like ashes, and for a long time, he just sits with his eyes closed, almost nodding off, before he attempts, poorly, to wash his hair, and then experiences an idiotic moment where he wishes Lan Zhan would do it for him. He would be so gentle and methodical about it, and Wei Wuxian suppresses a quiet ache when the image comes to mind, unbidden.</p>\n<p>He swallows it down, banishes it into a tarry pit where he has buried these errant thoughts with a growing regularity.</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji had hung a clean white inner robe on the side of the privacy screen, and Wei Wuxian slips into it gratefully, shivering in place for a moment, before he pads over into the next room, where he can hear Lan Wangji practicing the guqin.</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji glances up at his entry, and then he does something that Wei Wuxian has never, in the entirety of their acquaintance, witnessed \u2014 he messes up, a discordant note pinging from the strings. It\u2019s so startling in contrast with the gentle melody of the piece that Wei Wuxian almost flinches.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji is looking at him, fathomless in a way that makes Wei Wuxian stop short, uneasy. Surely they\u2019re close enough by now that he doesn\u2019t need more layers to be considered decent? The Lans are such a weird, stiff bunch.</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji drops his gaze back to the guqin, laying his palms over the strings. \u201cI have spare robes you can borrow while your others are cleaned.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Wei Wuxian says, rubbing his big toe against his bare heel.</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji excuses himself to bathe then, leaving Wei Wuxian to get dressed and nap for a while until he\u2019s done. The borrowed robes smell like Lan Zhan, crisp sandalwood and some other aroma he can\u2019t quite name. He feels clean and fresh and he <em> finally </em>smells good, and in this honey-warm state he floats in and out of a light sleep, and thinks that Lan Zhan\u2019s bed might be one of the most comfortable he\u2019s ever slept in.</p>\n<p>When Lan Wangji returns, he smells equally good, his pale skin free of blood or mud. It\u2019s sort of oddly shocking, to see him so immaculate again, as if Wei Wuxian has regularly seen him any other way. It makes him look, unfairly, even more like a deity than he did when blood-flecked and mud-soaked.</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian shakes himself awake, not wanting to be rude, but Lan Wangji softly says, \u201cWei Ying, sleep.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>He\u2019s almost tempted to, but Wei Wuxian actually, very much does want to hang out with Lan Zhan, in their time together. Between battles, sect drama, and family spats, it feels like they never have time like this \u2014 just to be with each other, the way friends should be.</p>\n<p>\u201cNot tired,\u201d Wei Wuxian says, which is so obviously a lie that Lan Wangji\u2019s eyes narrow a little, but Wei Wuxian stubbornly moves to the table across the room, where a pot of steaming tea is already prepared. The tea of Gusu is too acrid, too medicinal for Wei Wuxian's tastes, but Lan Zhan likes it, and so Wei Wuxian resolves to make himself like it as well.</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji joins him, sitting at the nearest corner of the table rather than directly across from him so that their crossed legs are almost brushing. Then Wei Wuxian kind of just props his chin on his hand and stares while Lan Wangji does things, like holding his white sleeve so it doesn't trail across the table, like pouring two hot streams of tea into their cups. His hair, still damp and raven-black, clings in places to his neck, the silky wet strands framing his face.</p>\n<p>\u201cYour shoulder?\u201d Lan Wangji asks, serving him first.</p>\n<p>\u201cFeels fine,\u201d Wei Wuxian answers, taking the tea. \u201cI kept the bandages dry.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji nods.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThank you for, ah,\u201d Wei Wuxian says, and blinks when Lan Wangji gives him a frank look, like he\u2019d said something to displease him. \u201cFor today.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t have the face to say what he really means, which is that it\u2019s been a long time since anyone besides shijie has cared for him like this. Or cared about him at all, really.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou are welcome,\u201d Lan Wangji says after another moment, then sips his tea.</p>\n<p>\u201cNow that...now that we have our bodies back, you won\u2019t have to be stuck near me all the time,\u201d Wei Wuxian jokes. His heart kind of hurts when he says it. \u201cYou\u2019re finally free, Hanguang-Jun! What will you do with all your newfound liberty?\u201d</p>\n<p>He expects Lan Wangji to scoff a little, to give him a narrow look or roll his eyes, but instead a corner of his mouth turns down. He keeps his eyes lowered. Asks quietly, \u201cIs that what Wei Ying wants?\u201d</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian blinks. He hasn\u2019t even considered for a moment what he wants. His tired brain hasn\u2019t even really made it past this afternoon.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d he says. \u201cAh. I just meant \u2014 for most people, a little of me goes a long way.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI am not,\u201d Lan Wangji says, coolly as he sets his cup down with a clink, \u201cmost people.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian stares. Surely, he\u2019s misinterpreting. There\u2019s no earthly reason why Lan Wangji, who had told him to piss off then threatened to beat his ass within their first few weeks together, wants Wei Wuxian hanging around him like a bad smell, after days of him doing just that.</p>\n<p>But Lan Zhan does not mince words, and he doesn\u2019t lie.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian brings the teacup to his lips, and finds his hands are trembling a little.</p>\n<p>\u201cLan Zhan ah, what a person you are,\u201d he says, weakly. \u201cSaying such sweet things with such a grave face. It\u2019s nice to know you care, after all.\u201d</p>\n<p><em> That </em>was certainly the wrong thing to say. Lan Wangji\u2019s face darkens at once, as close to true anger as Wei Wuxian has seen directed at him in a very long time.</p>\n<p>\u201cIs everything a joke to you?\u201d Lan Wangji says through his teeth.</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian gapes at him, speechless.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhen you were missing, I \u2014\u201d Lan Wangji tears his gaze away. Then he says, with the cadence of two punches, \u201cI cared.\u201d</p>\n<p>He adds then, quieter, \u201cIt wasn\u2019t enough.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI \u2014 I\u2019m sorry,\u201d Wei Wuxian stammers, somewhat appalled by his own callousness. Lan Wangji <em> had </em> searched for him alongside Jiang Cheng, in those three months, at great personal inconvenience. What a tactless, unappreciative thing to say. He curses his own stupid mouth. \u201cIt\u2019s just that I \u2014 that you \u2014\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI thought I lost you,\u201d Lan Wangji whispers. \u201cIn the Burial Mounds.\u201d</p>\n<p>The words are a blow Wei Wuxian wasn\u2019t expecting at all. Tears spring to his eyes immediately at the force of it.</p>\n<p>It takes him a moment before he\u2019s capable of responding.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey, you didn\u2019t,\u201d Wei Wuxian says weakly, swallowing thickly and taking Lan Wangji\u2019s hand in both of his. Lan Wangji doesn\u2019t seem to notice, his eyes haunted and faraway. \u201cLan Zhan, I\u2019m right here. I\u2019m not going anywhere.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji closes his eyes and gives a hard swallow, his long, dark lashes fluttering. He looks ten years younger and ten years older at once. He looks beautiful, open, irresistible.</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian leans in, before he can stop himself, and kisses him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He almost doesn\u2019t mean for it to happen, but then it does \u2014\u00a0it\u2019s his first kiss, so it turns out sort of shy and chaste, just a warm, clumsy brush of their mouths together, but he feels a molten heat flare through him at the contact.</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji gasps against his mouth, and Wei Wuxian remembers himself, yanks his body back.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji is staring at him with a stunned, wrecked expression, his light eyes wide and lips parted like he\u2019s just been shamelessly debauched, not barely-kissed.</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian knows at once, by Lan Wangji\u2019s face, that he\u2019s missed the mark. He\u2019s misunderstood everything. He frantically starts to backtrack, horror and shame welling up from a deep place.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry, Lan Zhan,\u201d he begins while Lan Wangji keeps staring at him like that. He ruins everything, he ruins everything, how could he ruin this one shining, important, untouchable thing? \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to \u2014 I thought that \u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>His words die at once when Lan Wangji firmly takes the lapel of his robe and pulls him back in, and Wei Wuxian\u2019s startled gasp is swallowed, as well as whatever else he was thinking of saying. This kiss is not so chaste, open-mouthed and wet with a hint of teeth, and so, so good that Wei Wuxian feels the power sapped straight from his limbs. The shock of its rightness feels cosmic.\u00a0</p>\n<p>After another helpless moment, Wei Wuxian raises his hands, where they\u2019re paralyzed at his sides, to tentatively touch, to cup Lan Wangji\u2019s neck (surprisingly warm), to slide up into his hair, still damp and slightly curling from the bath. He drops one hand to place a palm over Lan Wangji\u2019s heart, where he can feel a pulse hammering frantically against his skin.</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji\u2019s own hands seem frozen, as though he\u2019s not sure what to do, not sure what he\u2019s allowed. <em> Touch me, </em>Wei Wuxian can\u2019t bring himself to beg out loud, but Lan Wangji seems to hear him anyway; his own hands come up, wonderingly, to palm the nape of his neck, then he thumbs his cheekbones, either side of his jaw with such a tenderness that Wei Wuxian's eyes sting. Lan Wangji's hands trail down to his back, along his shoulder blades, his waist, his hips. Wei Wuxian hums an encouraging sound against his mouth, wanting more, and Lan Wangji\u2019s motions grow rougher, nails digging into his skin, dragging him closer, teeth sinking into his lower lip.</p>\n<p>Eventually, the kneeling and the crane in his neck become stiff and awkward, so Wei Wuxian walks himself forward on his knees without breaking the kiss, and almost passes right out when he feels Lan Wangji\u2019s large hand cupping the juncture where the back of his knee meets his thigh, a tentative question. Then he pulls \u2014 an invitation.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Barely breathing, Wei Wuxian allows himself to be manhandled into Lan Wangji\u2019s lap, the change in position effortless with Lan Wangji\u2019s strength lifting him by the backs of his thighs. Wei Wuxian\u2019s legs wrap around Lan Wangji\u2019s waist\u2014<em> much better, </em> he manages to think, with the very few words he still can still process. The new position allows him better leverage, so he deepens the kiss as best as he knows how, his hands sealed fast to either side of Lan Wangji\u2019s face so that no spaces remain between them.</p>\n<p>What both of them lack in experience, they clearly make up for in eagerness; when Wei Wuxian finally pulls himself back for air, his head is whirling with giddy adrenaline, a high more intoxicating than the finest liquor. Lan Wangji nips lightly at his jawbone, his teeth grazing down his neck, and Wei Wuxian\u2019s eyes fall shut, his head tipping back to allow him more access, his breaths embarrassingly loud and jagged in the quiet room. He feels alight in ways he never has, never imagined he could be.</p>\n<p>He lets out an embarrassing sound when Lan Wangji\u2019s teeth find his collarbone, where his robes have slipped down to skin. \u201cDoes \u2014 does this mean that\u2014\u201d God, his voice is embarrassing. \u201c\u2014 does this mean that you have a crush on me?\u201d</p>\n<p>What a stupid question, he thinks later. But it feels strangely important in the moment, and Lan Wangji pauses what he\u2019s doing.</p>\n<p>\u201cMn,\u201d he says into Wei Wuxian\u2019s shoulder \u2014 then, as if he\u2019s afraid he\u2019ll be misunderstood, he adds, more clearly, \u201cYes.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian is overcome by this. He buries his blushing face into Lan Wangji\u2019s shoulder, grinning madly from ear to ear. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Lan Wangji repeats, sounding bemused. His hands rub wide circles on Wei Wuxian\u2019s back, which feels heavenly.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s just that I also have a crush on you,\u201d Wei Wuxian says, keeping his face hidden as he says it, and he feels Lan Wangji go still beneath him. They\u2019re pressed chest to chest, so he can feel Lan Wangji\u2019s breathing stutter, his heart skipping faster in his chest.</p>\n<p>Surely this can\u2019t come as a <em> huge </em> surprise to anyone \u2014 again, Wei Wuxian cannot emphasize enough his artless lack of subtlety \u2014 but Lan Wangji crushes him tighter to his chest and breathes into his neck, shaking slightly beneath him.</p>\n<p>If Wei Wuxian is being fully honest with himself (which he rarely is), <em> crush </em>doesn\u2019t really begin to cover it, although he has dismissed it as such for a while now because it was easier, less painful. In fact, his poor heart is currently swooning like a lovestruck loon, but he doesn\u2019t want to push it, not when he\u2019s unsure the depth of his feelings will be matched \u2014 not when he\u2019s already gotten this.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d Wei Wuxian asks after a few moments, growing concerned as the silence and hug stretch on without any hint of stopping. \u201cDid I break you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMn,\u201d Lan Wangji mumbles, and Wei Wuxian laughs and presses a kiss to his temple. <em> I love him, </em>he thinks, and the immediacy, the fondness of the thought are as flattening as they are natural, like he\u2019s drawing a breath, like his heart is beating.</p>\n<p>\u201cLan Zhan, you're so cute like this,\u201d he says instead, cupping both of Lan Wangji\u2019s cheeks so he can properly look at him, so he can drink his fill of Lan Wangji's mouth swollen and wine-red, the gold in his eyes eclipsed by black, his forehead ribbon askew. The unfair, improbable beauty of him. He had missed this face just in the past couple of days more than he ever imagined he could.</p>\n<p>\u201cI missed seeing you,\u201d Lan Wangji says, unconsciously echoing his thoughts as he lays his hands on top of Wei Wuxian\u2019s. He adds, almost inaudible, \u201cI always miss Wei Ying.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian exhales for a long beat, trying to breathe around those words. \u201cAll of this endearing honesty, er-gege. Where did it come from all of a sudden?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t say it before,\u201d Lan Wangji whispers, his eyes on the floor, and the words feel confessional.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d Wei Wuxian asks, just as quiet.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI was afraid,\u201d Lan Wangji says. He adds, impossibly softer, \u201cI couldn\u2019t bear if you hated me.\u201d</p>\n<p>The thought is so inimical to his very core that Wei Wuxian physically starts. \u201c<em>Hate you</em>? Lan Zhan, I could never. <em>Hate you</em>, psh \u2014 I\u2019ve always thought you were the smartest person I\u2019ve ever met but I guess I was wrong. That is so dumb. I would beat up any version of me who hated you. I want to beat you up a little bit for even thinking that.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji makes a noise into his hair, and Wei Wuxian realizes with a belated thrill that it <em> might </em>have been a half-laugh.</p>\n<p>\u201cHate you,\u201d Wei Wuxian mutters, still mortally offended. He kisses the spot between Lan Wangji\u2019s eyebrows as though he\u2019s been doing it every day of his life. His nose brushes against the ribbon. \u201cRidiculous.\u201d</p>\n<p>Then he pulls at Lan Wangji\u2019s robes, topples them both backwards until he\u2019s flat on his back and Lan Zhan is hovering over him, his long hair swinging down and tickling his face. Wei Wuxian tugs his clothes again, insistent, until Lan Wangji understands and carefully lowers his body weight against his, a warm and steady press into the ground. He\u2019s careful to bear down more on the left side, mindful of the twinge in Wei Wuxian\u2019s shoulder.</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian makes a contented humming noise, wrapping both his arms around Lan Wangji\u2019s shoulders so that he\u2019s hugging him, tight enough that their heartbeats clash against each other\u2019s chests. He kisses the underside of his chin while Lan Wangji just gazes down at him, half-fond, half-mystified, like he\u2019s not quite sure what to do with him.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou feel good like this,\u201d Wei Wuxian explains, and kisses him again. Lan Wangji leans into it eagerly, his thigh shifting between both of Wei Wuxian\u2019s, and both of them pull back to take staggered breaths at the sensation.</p>\n<p>\u201cMaybe\u2026\u201d Lan Wangji says slowly, and Wei Wuxian watches with delight as his ears start to glow pink. \u201cThis...may be more comfortable on a bed.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian\u2019s mouth falls open in mock-astonishment even as an excited heat bursts through him. \u201c<em>Lan Wangji. </em>So shameless! Is Lan er-gongzi really offering to throw me over his shoulder and bed me? By the heavens, my virtue has never been so besmirched. Such a wicked proposition to defile my temperance and <em>restraint</em>\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWei Ying,\u201d Lan Wangji says, sounding pained. \u201cI only meant that\u2026\u201d He struggles for a minute, and Wei Wuxian almost feels bad for him. Almost.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m joking, of course,\u201d Wei Wuxian says with a grin. He loops his arms around Lan Wangji\u2019s neck. \u201cFine, have your way. Ravish me, Hanguang-Jun.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji is unconscious.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Surely that\u2019s the only rational explanation for how any of this can be happening \u2014 he'd knocked himself out fighting the creature earlier, and his subconscious is being extraordinarily cruel in its realism, even crueler than usual, or \u2014</p>\n<p>\u201cLan Zhan,\u201d Wei Ying says, a hot thrum against his ear. \u201cI can hear you overthinking. Stop it.\u201d</p>\n<p>They\u2019re still standing in the middle of the <em> jingshi</em>, where Lan Wangji had frozen the second they\u2019d pulled themselves up. Wei Ying\u2019s arms drape over his shoulders, and he\u2019s gazing up at him with his cheeks flushed and his lips slightly swollen and his eyes uncannily bright.</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji blinks down at him, and tries to recalibrate.</p>\n<p>\u201cWas the ravishing bit too much?\u201d Wei Ying asks, looking genuinely worried for Lan Wangji\u2019s health. \u201cI was only kidding, really. Sometimes my mouth just starts and I can\u2019t stop it for anything.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI am fine,\u201d Lan Wangji says, returning to the earthly plane.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe don\u2019t even have to do anything,\u201d Wei Ying says, taking both of his hands and looking up at him with such sweet earnestness that Lan Wangji\u2019s heart constricts in his chest. \u201cI just want to be close to you. We can just lay down and do nothing, I don\u2019t care. Whatever you want.\u201d</p>\n<p>What Lan Wangji wants could fill this room tenfold. His fear is that he wants too much.</p>\n<p>\u201cI want\u2026\u201d Lan Wangji tries to say, but his mouth has always failed him, when it comes to Wei Ying. He makes a frustrated sound, then finishes, or perhaps supplicates, \u201cWei Ying.\u201d</p>\n<p>That will have to suffice; it\u2019s not technically incorrect.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou have me,\u201d Wei Ying says, easy as anything, and Lan Wangji buries his face in Wei Ying\u2019s shoulder at that, even as Wei Ying huffs a quiet sound of surprise.</p>\n<p>\u201cAh, poor Lan Zhan,\u201d he says softly, petting his hair, petting his back. \u201cYou\u2019re far too good.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cStop,\u201d Lan Wangji says, and Wei Ying laughs, not a trace of mockery in it.</p>\n<p>\u201cCome, come,\u201d Wei Ying says, and Lan Wangji lets himself be guided toward the bed, where Wei Ying lets go of his hands and perches on the edge of the mattress to gaze up at him through his lashes, coquettish.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat do you think, Lan Zhan?\u201d Wei Ying leans back in a coy stretch. \u201cI\u2019m far less pretty now than I was yesterday, but you still like me, right?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI would love Wei Ying in any body,\u201d Lan Wangji says, words almost stumbling in his sincerity.</p>\n<p>Wei Ying\u2019s mouth drops open, blood rushing to his face. Then he buries his face in his palms and says several mushed, unintelligible things there. Lan Wangji waits patiently.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou can\u2019t say things like that to me, Lan Zhan,\u201d Wei Ying whines a moment later, when he\u2019s finally coherent. He looks at Lan Wangji with something bordering on despair. \"<em>Please, </em>I really can\u2019t handle it at all.\u201d</p>\n<p>Had it been too much to say out loud? It\u2019s only true. Lan Wangji feels a great sense of unburdening \u2014 the weight of those unspoken truths had crowded his throat until he couldn\u2019t breathe, and now, Wei Ying will know it all. As he deserves to.</p>\n<p>\u201cLan Zhan.\u201d Wei Ying is staring at him, a strange glow in his face. \u201cCome here.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji does.</p>\n<p>Wei Ying scoots to the edge of the bed so that his knees fall apart, and he takes Lan Wangji\u2019s hands again and tugs him so that he\u2019s standing between his open legs. He only has two of Lan Wangji\u2019s lighter robes on, cinched at the waist by a simple cloth belt, and he gently guides one of Lan Wangji\u2019s hands to his hip. It\u2019s a tentative question, and an invitation.</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji takes a steadying breath, heart in his throat, and pulls at the belt so the robes loosen, slackening so they spill off of Wei Ying\u2019s shoulders and collarbones. Wei Ying\u2019s eyes are closed, his eyelashes a sooty sweep against his cheekbones. As though he\u2019s waiting for something with bated breath.</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji wants to push him down into the bed and take him apart until he cries, tear off the rest of his clothes with his teeth, if he needs to, but he can\u2019t \u2014 he isn\u2019t sure what he\u2019s allowed to \u2014 what Wei Ying prefers \u2014 He nearly shakes with the restraint of it.</p>\n<p>Wei Ying opens his eyes to gaze up at him through his lashes; pupils wide and dark, thin rings of silver like a lunar eclipse.</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you really going to make me beg, Hanguang-Jun?\u201d he asks in a low voice, bunching his fingers in the front of Lan Wangji\u2019s robes. \u201cWhat more can I do to persuade you to touch me?\u201d</p>\n<p>This, finally, is all Lan Wangji needs to hear.\u00a0</p>\n<p>In one smooth movement, he pins Wei Ying\u2019s shoulders to the mattress, tipping them both so fast that Wei Ying yelps in surprise. He gathers Wei Ying\u2019s wrists in one hand and anchors them above his head as Wei Ying sounds his approval and looks up at him with his lips curving, his eyes rapt with anticipation and \u2014 and something else more intense. The edge of something tender and hungry in equal measure. Lan Wangji inclines his head to drag his teeth along Wei Ying\u2019s neck, keeping his wrists firmly planted into the mattress as he does, and Wei Ying shudders out a breathy, high-pitched sound and rolls his hips into him.</p>\n<p>\u201cToo many clothes, Lan Zhan,\u201d he whispers then, and Lan Wangji doesn\u2019t hesitate to comply.</p>\n<p>His hands make surprisingly fast work of Wei Ying\u2019s robes, as though he\u2019s been doing this for years, and Wei Ying murmurs encouragement to him, lifting himself to one elbow and wriggling a little to help with the process.</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji has caught glimpses, flashes, pieces of Wei Ying\u2019s exposed skin over the years \u2014 a wrist here, a collarbone there, the nape of his neck when his hair is tucked up into a bun or parted to one side. Each one had seared itself into his memory, had shot him through like an arrow with helpless, crazed longing that he could never rationalize or meditate away.\u00a0</p>\n<p>So for a moment, at the sight of Wei Ying almost all but bare to him, he can do nothing but sit back and stare dumbly, his breath tight in his throat and his fists clenching. Again, he takes a moment to wonder if he's dreaming.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHelp me,\u201d Wei Ying says with a laugh as he struggles with his tangled trousers, oblivious to how he\u2019s being looked at, and like a man possessed, Lan Wangji allows himself to reach out.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Finally, it\u2019s his own hands on Wei Ying\u2019s body, peeling away layers. Lan Wangji can\u2019t stop looking, committing everything to memory, starving like a caged animal to feel, consume. He aches to touch, but slows his trembling hands until Wei Ying catches them in his.</p>\n<p>\u201cEr-gege,\u201d Wei Ying croons, and Lan Wangji\u2019s breathing stops in his chest. Wei Ying lays back against the pillows, his hair an inky spill behind him, looks Lan Wangji in the eye and says, equally breathless, \u201cKiss me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji doesn\u2019t need to be asked twice. In one surge, his mouth finds Wei Ying\u2019s, a warm press that opens up into something harder, deeper, filthier. Lan Wangji drinks in every sound from him, every stuttered breath and soft gasp as their tongues tentatively, then more earnestly explore each other. He hadn\u2019t imagined \u2014 when he did allow himself to imagine it \u2014 that such a sensation could possibly be enjoyable, but Wei Ying is in the habit of proving him wrong in only the best of ways. This feels like a staked claim.\u00a0</p>\n<p>They kiss for what could be hours. Time seems to warp, soften, bending around them like river currents. Wei Ying occasionally breaks apart to murmur something tender against Lan Wangji\u2019s mouth before he pulls him back in, as if unable to stop.\u00a0</p>\n<p>When Lan Wangji at last pulls away to catch a full breath, he finds himself light-headed, his mouth slick and bruised, kiss-swollen. Wei Ying\u2019s eyes devour every pore of his face, night-dark and ravenous, and for the first time, Lan Wangji can see clearly his own desire mirrored back at him. He wouldn\u2019t have thought it possible before, but the hard, hot press of Wei Ying into his hip confirms the unbelievable \u2014 that Wei Ying wants this, wants him in turn.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re so\u2026\u201d Wei Ying whispers, a hand drifting up to frame his cheek, stroking a thumb there. Lan Wangji ducks his head to press a gentle kiss into his palm, and Wei Ying sucks in a fast, sharp breath.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He pulls Lan Wangji down then, closer until their foreheads are resting against each other, the ribbon pressing into his skin.</p>\n<p>\u201cI think I really love you,\u201d Wei Ying whispers into the space between them. \u201cI think I\u2019ll love you for my whole life.\u201d</p>\n<p>Something breaks in Lan Wangji at those words, like ice floats cracking and giving way into summer warmth. The water roars around him, over his head, and it takes Wei Ying\u2019s laughter into his mouth to realize he\u2019d started kissing Wei Ying frantically again, pulling kiss after kiss out of him.</p>\n<p>\u201cIs that a \u2018me too?\u2019\u201d Wei Ying asks when he pulls back, only a sliver of uncertainty in his voice.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d Lan Wangji whispers, so earnest that Wei Ying\u2019s face breaks into a smile like the sun from behind a cloud. \u201cThis life and the next, and the next.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wei Ying\u2019s eyes widen, and he starts muttering again as he presses his burning face into Lan Wangji\u2019s bare shoulder.</p>\n<p>\u201cI can\u2019t take it at all when you talk to me like that,\u201d he says, muffled. \u201cHanguang-Jun, warn me first, please?\u201d</p>\n<p>In place of an answer, Lan Wangji pulls back and kisses Wei Ying\u2019s forehead. Then both of his closed eyelids, his nose, a chaste brush to his lips, his jaw. Wei Ying starts to squirm, ticklish under Lan Wangji\u2019s touches, then swallows a gasp as Lan Wangji kisses behind his ear, sinks a light bite into his earlobe, then nips downward, down the graceful lines of his neck.</p>\n<p>\u201cLan Zhan \u2014 \u201d he says faintly, but Lan Wangji doesn\u2019t stop, sealing kisses to his collarbones, over his heart. He sinks his teeth with the lightest pressure over one of Wei Ying\u2019s dark nipples, and Wei Ying groans in shock and rocks his hips against him in small, circular motions.\u00a0</p>\n<p>All of this, every touch \u2014 shameless, <em> forbidden, </em>but Lan Wangji would take a stroke of the discipline whip for each kiss he can press into Wei Ying\u2019s skin. Nothing else in the world matters besides this.</p>\n<p>After the buds of Wei Ying\u2019s nipples are slick and hard, after Wei Ying is panting raggedly, Lan Wangji kisses the Wen brand, a reclamation of that sun for himself, and as though he understands, Wei Ying digs his fingers harder into Lan Wangji\u2019s shoulders. Lan Wangji dips lower then, traces the shape of the large, welted scar under his navel with his tongue. Wei Ying\u2019s responding whine rips through him like a bolt of lightning.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to\u2014\u201d Wei Ying protests, his abdominal muscles twitching under his mouth, but Lan Wangji ignores him and continues what he\u2019s doing until Wei Ying is making these soft, wounded sounds, interspersed with whispers of his name.</p>\n<p><em> Beautiful, </em> Lan Wangji thinks, and he must murmur it out loud because Wei Ying gasps, \u201c<em>Don\u2019t\u2014 </em>\u201d and buries his fingers in Lan Wangji\u2019s hair.</p>\n<p>It isn\u2019t often that Wei Ying is rendered speechless, and Lan Wangji takes a private moment to feel smug about it as he dips lower, where he can feel heat and hardness and Wei Ying's scent, earthen and heady.</p>\n<p>Wei Ying props himself up on his elbows to stare down at Lan Wangji, eyes wide in the muted silver of the moonlight through the <em> jingshi </em>windows, his chest heaving. Good. Lan Wangji wants him to look for this. Wei Ying watches him down the length of his body, his expression warring between nervous anticipation and a hungry yearning that makes Lan Wangji\u2019s blood hot as sunlight, thrumming through him.</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji locks eyes with him so that he has the privilege of watching Wei Ying\u2019s head tip back, his eyes screwing shut and his mouth falling open as Lan Wangji takes him in his mouth. <em>Finally, </em>is all he can think.</p>\n<p>Wei Ying makes a strangled, wild sound and his hips jolt at the sensation; Lan Wangji chokes immediately, pulling off for air and eyes watering as Wei Ying pets at his hair and murmurs, \u201cSorrysorrysorrysorry.\u201d Lan Wangji shakes his head at him, a wordless reminder that apologies aren\u2019t needed, and Wei Ying\u2019s hands slow, stroking his cheek until Lan Wangji resumes what he was doing with renewed vigor. He palms the inside of Wei Ying\u2019s knee with one hand, using the other to neatly tuck his hair and the tail of his forehead ribbon away from his face, where they won't get in the way.</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji is nothing if not a fast and studious learner, and he soon finds a rhythm and position that draw the most vocal reactions. Wei Ying\u2019s fit of apparent speechlessness passes, as does Lan Wangji\u2019s smugness over the matter \u2014 Wei Ying soon starts babbling, one rushed and breathy sentence after the next.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re so good at this, how are you so good at this like you are \u2014 <em> hah \u2014 </em> at everything else, Hanguang-Jun? <em> Ah, </em> mercy, mercy<em>, </em> please \u2014 what would others say, Lan er-gege, if they saw you like this? <em> Fuck \u2014 </em>\u201d The first curse word is wrung from him as Lan Wangji takes him deeper, slower. \u201cYou\u2019re too much, you\u2019re too much, please \u2014 L-Lan Zhan, did you know I thought about this, back in our early days? Except it was reversed, I would kneel for you in the library and take you apart \u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>This Lan Wangji cannot abide; he pulls off with a <em> pop </em> and says, hoarsely, \u201cWei <em> Ying</em>,\u201d but it comes out much more a plea than a protest.</p>\n<p>Wei Ying, full-body flushed even in the low light, smirks at him and reaches down, gently thumbing the shell of his ear, which is of course on fire. \u201cSuch an upright gentleman, Hanguang-Jun \u2014 I would have never thought that you\u2019d be so \u2014 <em> agh!</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji had bent his head to nip at the soft inside of Wei Ying\u2019s thigh in admonishment, then again, sinking his teeth in lightly.</p>\n<p>\u201cBiting, Lan Zhan?! So <em> uncivilized,</em>\u201d Wei Ying gasps between breathless giggles. \u201cOkay, okay, I\u2019ll be quiet if you get back to what you were doing \u2014 I\u2019ll be so quiet and good \u2014 <em> yes</em>, right there, <em> please \u2014 </em>\u201d</p>\n<p>Wei Ying is far from quiet, but Lan Wangji drinks in each of his words and sounds like a willow parched of water. On a particularly sharp cry, Lan Wangji pulls off again, ignoring Wei Ying\u2019s outraged, feral noise of protest, to whisper, \u201cQuieter, Wei Ying,\u201d because the <em> jingshi </em> is not so far from the <em> hanshi </em>or from shufu\u2019s quarters, and Wei Ying is currently breaking several noise prohibition rules.</p>\n<p>\u201cMake me,\u201d Wei Ying throws back, and grins crookedly when Lan Wangji glares at him without any heat. His eyes suddenly widen, as though he\u2019s discovered something new about himself. \u201c...Could you really make me, Lan Zhan?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLater,\u201d Lan Wangji says, already distracted by the view and the primal need to get back to the task at hand. He is not, in fact, made of hard jade as everyone claims.</p>\n<p>Wei Ying is still trembling with sensation, his thighs already shaking when Lan Wangji swallows him down again. The renewed effort starts up another round of Wei Ying\u2019s soft cries, and Lan Wangji is far too turned on to stop him again. Despite the soreness in his jaw, he works Wei Ying more earnestly when his stammered words become less and less intelligible.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m going to \u2014\u201d Wei Ying eventually says in a wild voice, trying to push Lan Wangji\u2019s shoulder in a feeble attempt to warn him. \u201cLan Zhan, you don\u2019t have to \u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji steels his hands in an iron grip to Wei Ying\u2019s hips, pinning him to the bed so he won\u2019t buck. When he fixes his gaze to Wei Ying\u2019s, Wei Ying\u2019s eyes are glazed, his mouth ajar, and Lan Wangji makes his intentions clear there.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Fuck</em>,\u201d Wei Ying says, heartfelt, and he comes. Lan Wangji almost gags and chokes at the suddenness of it, but presses Wei Ying down firmly as he swallows, evening out the stuttering thrusts of his hips.</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji keeps going until Wei Ying is spent, until he collapses back boneless on the mattress, thighs intermittently jerking with the overstimulation, and he whispers, \u201cMercy, Lan Zhan, mercy,\u201d and only then does Lan Wangji pull away, sealing a kiss to his hipbone.</p>\n<p>\u201cCome here right now,\u201d Wei Ying demands when he can speak again, grabbing for him, and then he hugs Lan Wangji\u2019s head so that his face is buried in his chest. Wei Ying presses a tired kiss to his hair. \u201cSo good, my Lan Zhan. I concede, I concede graciously \u2014 you win, even at this.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGood?\u201d Lan Wangji asks, curious for feedback. His voice is muffled into Wei Ying\u2019s overheated skin.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Good? </em>I think you\u2019ve ruined me for life,\u201d Wei Ying wheezes. \u201cThis is all I\u2019m ever going to want until I die.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji hums into Wei Ying\u2019s chest, ignoring the bird wing flutter in his ribcage at the inherent promise there. It feels dangerously like hope, so dizzying in scope that he can hardly fathom it, so he tries to push it down and bury it.</p>\n<p><em> For life, </em>he keeps hearing in Wei Ying\u2019s voice, echoing like thunder in his ears.</p>\n<p>After another moment like this, Lan Wangji shifts with discomfort. He\u2019s so hard that a pointed ache throbs behind his navel, a concentrated heat, but he can\u2019t care, not being pressed so close to Wei Ying so loose and affectionate like this. His pleasure is secondary, and that\u2019s exactly how he wants it.</p>\n<p>Wei Ying evidently doesn\u2019t think so, because he pushes at Lan Wangji\u2019s shoulder and says, \u201cHey, you\u2019re not falling asleep, are you? Surely you don\u2019t think I\u2019m so heartless?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWei Ying,\u201d Lan Wangji says, half-wry as Wei Ying flips them so Lan Wangji is on his back, but despite himself, his breathing staggers, his heart pounding against his ribs at the thought of Wei Ying touching him. Wei Ying settles so that his knees are bracketed around Lan Wangji\u2019s hips, their laps flush together.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re far more dressed than I am,\u201d Wei Ying complains, starting to tear at the layers. \u201cTell me how that\u2019s fair? I haven\u2019t spent days inside this body trying to avoid looking or touching only to be denied so cruelly now.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji reaches up to help, their trembling hands knocking and brushing together as they both work at Lan Wangji\u2019s layers until his chest is fully exposed to the night air, humming with the whir of crickets and their shared breaths. Wei Ying runs his hands greedily over his collarbones, his pectorals, across the flat and hard expanse of his abdominal muscles to the trail of hair that leads to his waistband.</p>\n<p>Then, to Lan Wangji\u2019s surprise and dismay, Wei Ying starts laughing, and stops what he\u2019s doing to bury his face in his hands.</p>\n<p>\u201cWei Ying?\u201d he says, uncertainly. He can\u2019t tell if he\u2019s being laughed at, and if so, how he should feel about that.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Wei Ying says, resurfacing. \u201cOh, I\u2019m sorry, it\u2019s not you at all, that timing was so rude of me, you\u2019re just \u2014 so perfect that it feels fake. And I\u2019m marveling at my luck, and also your judgment by having anything to do with me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji starts to sit up, determined to flip Wei Ying back over and show him, <em> again, </em>exactly why he\u2019s wrong, but Wei Ying pushes his shoulders back to the bed and says, \u201cNo. My turn.\u201d</p>\n<p>His hand picks up where he left off, trailing down his chest and torso, then lower. The touch leaves fire in its wake, a burn that stings on Lan Wangji\u2019s skin. Lan Wangji tries to control his breathing, bites down on his lip to keep from making any noise.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Then, as if he doesn\u2019t think anything of it, Wei Ying spits into his palm, twice for good measure, before his fingers dip below Lan Wangji\u2019s waistband, taking him in hand.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji arches into the touch, breathing out hard through his nose. Even in the darkness, he can see how red Wei Ying has become, touching him this way.</p>\n<p>\u201cI see that Hanguang-Jun is well-endowed in every respect,\u201d Wei Ying murmurs, flushing more even as he offers Lan Wangji a wide, teasing smile.</p>\n<p>\u201cShameless,\u201d Lan Wangji whispers, and Wei Ying grins harder.</p>\n<p>\u201cAh, Lan Zhan, you like that about me,\u201d he says, and with his free hand, finally strips Lan Wangji of the last of his clothes. The cool evening breeze sweeps over his exposed skin, and he tries to breathe evenly through the onslaught of sensation, of the physical weight of Wei Ying\u2019s burning gaze on him.</p>\n<p>Wei Ying, for a moment, just sits back on his heels and stares, until Lan Wangji cannot bear the heat of it a moment longer and implores, \u201cWei Ying.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wei Ying visibly shakes himself, then leans forward so that he lowers himself on top of Lan Wangji, chest to chest. This close, Lan Wangji can feel the searing heat of Wei Ying against his stomach, already half-hard again, but Wei Ying doesn\u2019t seem to notice. He kisses Lan Wangji with an intensity that steals the breath from him, a warm rhythm of teeth and tongue. As he does, his hand finds Lan Wangji again, and aligning their hips, he strokes the two of them together in hand.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji jerks into Wei Ying, skidding against his bare stomach with a force that judders the both of them. He bites off sounds into Wei Ying\u2019s mouth, and Wei Ying whispers, \u201cLan Zhan, I want to hear you,\u201d and at this, Lan Wangji can\u2019t help but make a small noise, a near-whimper. Wei Ying\u2019s eyes darken at the sound, and he lowers his head to murmur to him.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re so good,\u201d Wei Ying rasps, low into his ear, and he sucks at the skin just below, marking it with teeth. \u201cYou\u2019re so, so good, Lan Zhan, no one deserves you \u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji tries to protest, but Wei Ying fists them then in a way that makes them both groan, a vocal hum against each other\u2019s skin.</p>\n<p>Every point of contact between their body sparks. Lan Wangji has never been so painfully hard in his life, so dizzying close to coming that it nearly hurts, a jagged edge. He can\u2019t help but stagger his breathing into Wei Ying\u2019s hair.</p>\n<p>\u201cDoes it feel good?\u201d Wei Ying keeps going, teeth skimming Lan Wangji\u2019s earlobe. \u201cI want you to feel good, I want to see you \u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d is all Lan Wangji can gasp out. \u201cWei Ying.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wei Ying ducks his head to look down at their bodies, his breaths accelerating at the sight.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Fuck,</em>\u201d he whispers again, sounding dazed. \u201cYou feel so good, you feel so \u2014 <em> Lan Zhan \u2014 </em>\u201d</p>\n<p>It\u2019s only Wei Ying\u2019s hand on him, and it\u2019s only been a few moments, but Lan Wangji can feel some sweet edge cresting within him, so intense he feels the shock of it in his throat, in his teeth. He had already been close before \u2014 just the experience of bringing Wei Ying off had done that. As though to anchor himself, one of his hands twists into the sheets, the other clawing into Wei Ying\u2019s shoulder, sure to leave a mark. Wei Ying\u2019s hand speeds up, his words faster and dirtier in Lan Wangji\u2019s ear, until Lan Wangji arches with a snap of his hips, gasps and chokes out his name, and then it\u2019s over in a starburst of white, seemingly as fast as it had started.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Through the rush of sensation, he is dimly aware that Wei Ying follows, coming for the second time with a muffled cry into his neck, shuddering in violent tremors. Wei Ying kisses him through the aftershocks of it, his motions slowing as Lan Wangji wilts bonelessly back into the bed.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji is shaking, his breaths labored against Wei Ying\u2019s mouth. Both of their bodies are a slick tangle, between the sweat and other fluids.</p>\n<p>Wei Ying breaks away from the kiss to sink lower down his body, his tongue lapping at the mess on his stomach even as Lan Wangji wheezes both in protest and a new spike of arousal, despite how spent he is. \u201cWei <em> Ying</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Wei Ying asks, frowning up at him. His cheeks are still rose-patched, his eyes dazed and bright. \u201cYou did it for me. It\u2019s only fair.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji is utterly incapable of saying a single thing. He can hardly think. Everything is starting to catch up to him in wave after sensory wave, now that the haze of lust is fading, and he can barely begin to process it.</p>\n<p>Wei Ying crawls back up to lay their sticky chests together again, tucking his head comfortably under Lan Wangji\u2019s chin.</p>\n<p>\u201cGood for you, too?\u201d he asks, sleepily.</p>\n<p>\u201cMn,\u201d Lan Wangji whispers, afraid to say anything else at the moment.</p>\n<p>\u201cYour poetry astounds, Hanguang-Jun.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCan write Wei Ying poetry, if he wishes,\u201d Lan Wangji murmurs, kissing the top of his head.</p>\n<p>\u201cI would <em> die,</em>\u201d Wei Ying informs him, his arms curling closer around Lan Wangji\u2019s sides. \u201cI would perish on the spot.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHm. No poetry, then.\u201d</p>\n<p>For several moments, they just lie together, their breaths gradually slowing to match each other\u2019s. Lan Wangji strokes a hand through Wei Ying\u2019s hair, still silken from the bath and damp with sweat, and Wei Ying hums and nuzzles into the touch like a cat.</p>\n<p>Then Wei Ying reaches one tentative hand toward Lan Wangji's forehead, offering a quiet laugh. \"I can't believe you kept this on the whole time. It's all crooked and, ah...stained now.\"</p>\n<p>\"I forgot,\" Lan Wangji says honestly. He would clean it later.</p>\n<p>He keeps his breaths even as Wei Ying's hand hesitates, then stills.</p>\n<p>\"Can I...\" Wei Ying asks, quietly and with an endearing (and unusual) level of deference, and Lan Wangji suppresses a smile, barely.</p>\n<p>\"You may,\" Lan Wangji replies, and is somewhat surprised to see that Wei Ying's fingers are trembling as he tugs at the silken band, freeing it from the loose knot that had only grown looser from their activities.</p>\n<p>\"Wo-ow,\" Wei Ying says, holding it in his hands while Lan Wangji's traitorous heart thumps, thumps, thumps madly. \"I really thought with all that fuss that I would at least get special powers from this or something.\"</p>\n<p>\"Not quite,\" Lan Wangji says, amused despite himself.</p>\n<p>Not being Lan, Wei Ying can't possibly understand the true meaning of what it means for Lan Wangji to give him the ribbon, even if Wei Ying does know in a roundabout way that it is significant. Although Lan Wangji had reacted with appropriate outrage whenever Wei Ying did mess with it during their time together, the forehead ribbon in truth has belonged equally to Wei Ying for a long time. In Cold Pond Cave, Lan Wangji had known fully the pact he was entering into by handfasting with Wei Ying, according to rules etched into him for as long as he can remember. He'd known it meant that there could never be another. He had done it anyway, with no hesitation.</p>\n<p>As though echoing his thoughts, Wei Ying ties one end of the ribbon to his wrist, then almost shyly, like he's not sure he's allowed, he takes Lan Wangji's wrist and does the same. Lan Wangji's whole being aches with a fierce joy.</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay, so, no poetry,\" Wei Ying says, curling back into Lan Wangji's chest and closing his eyes. \"Can you sing for me instead, Lan Zhan? That one you sang for me in the cave?\u201d</p>\n<p>After a moment, in a low, melodious hum, Lan Wangji does.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u2014</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u00a0</p>\n<p>So, once again, Wei Wuxian had finally gotten Lan Zhan in bed \u2014 this time in the <em> proper</em>, sexy context \u2014 and it had absolutely wrecked his poor, virginal, unsuspecting mind.</p>\n<p>Lying there with Lan Zhan, he still feels flush with sense-memory, sort of disbelieving at his own wantonness as he replays the scenes, but \u2014 well, actually, no, he believes it. He\u2019s mostly wondering how he\u2019s ever going to occupy the same space as Lan Zhan and not immediately jump him, regardless of their audience. Now that this door has been cracked open, Wei Wuxian wants with a fierceness that aches down to his marrow; he wants and wants and wants.</p>\n<p><em> Is that what it feels like for everyone</em>? he wonders as he draws light circles around Lan Wangji\u2019s nipple with his thumb. It can\u2019t be that good for everyone. How on earth would anyone get anything done? Already, he\u2019s plotting out his next week so that he won\u2019t have to leave the <em> jingshi.\u00a0 </em></p>\n<p>Oh, there\u2019s the big conference with the different sects tomorrow morning, but Wei Wuxian has never felt less inclined to attend. He thinks that despite Lan Wangji\u2019s rule-following streak, he might actually agree. Lan Qiren might bastinado Wei Wuxian out of existence if he suspects him of keeping GusuLan\u2019s shining disciple away from important sect duties, especially to go off and deflower himself with the cultivation world\u2019s current least favorite person, but Wei Wuxian thinks it might be worth it.</p>\n<p>Lan Zhan had very considerately cleaned them up with a wet cloth, so now Wei Wuxian is curled up into his side, his arm thrown over his chest and his ear pressed to the rhythmic drum of Lan Wangji\u2019s heartbeat. The windows are still open in the <em> jingshi</em>, and rain has started to fall in the Cloud Recesses, pattering in the leaves of the trees. A crisp breeze gusts over them every so often, cooling the sweat on their bodies.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian thinks that he could die happy like this, except then he wouldn\u2019t get to try out other things on Lan Zhan, which he\u2019s very much looking forward to as soon as his energy returns.</p>\n<p>\u201cLan Zhan,\u201d he murmurs, brushing lips over his skin. \u201cAre you happy?\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji's answer is immediate and steady. \u201cThe most.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian tucks into him closer, squeezing his eyes shut against a smile. \u201cMe too.\u201d</p>\n<p>One of Lan Wangji\u2019s graceful hands idly strokes up and down Wei Wuxian\u2019s back, occasionally pausing to trace the figure for <em> ai </em>with his fingertip. The other is still tied to Wei Wuxian's, their fingers intertwined.</p>\n<p>\u201cLan Zhan,\u201d Wei Wuxian says again, his eyelids drooping. \u201cHow long?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHm?\u201d Lan Wangji answers a moment later, as though pulled from thought.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhen did you start liking me?\u201d Wei Wuxian says, unsticking his cheek from Lan Wangji\u2019s chest to look up at him. \u201cTell me, I\u2019m curious.\u201d</p>\n<p>If Wei Wuxian didn\u2019t know any better, he would say it\u2019s a half-smile that pulls at the corner of Lan Wangji\u2019s mouth.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cGuess,\u201d he says.</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian grouses for a moment. Patience is not one of his virtues, and of course Lan Wangji wants to play games like this.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cFine. Was it\u2026\u201d He thinks for a moment, mentally flipping through their interactions. \u201cAfter we spoke on the roof, that night in Qinghe?\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji huffs, as though incredulous. \u201cNo.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLater than that?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cEarlier.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian is more alert now, suddenly very keen on getting the answer. \u201cWhen we were apart for all those months, you realized in a fit of passion that you loved me for my body, and I was the only one you could ever love forevermore?\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji still sounds amused. \u201cNo.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Still </em>earlier than that?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMn.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLan Zhan,\u201d Wei Wuxian says, surprised. \u201cWho knew your face was so thick? I really thought you didn\u2019t like me at all.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWei Ying is oblivious,\u201d Lan Wangji replies, which is rude but completely called for.</p>\n<p>\u201cFine, fine. <em> Oh, </em> I know \u2014 when we were trapped in the cave for all those days with the Tusha Xuanwu. You sang me your song you like so much; you were <em> so </em>angry when I brought up Mianmian, hahaha \u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Lan Wangji says, and Wei Wuxian sits up. The urge to tease is gone; something new has replaced it, a sudden desperation to know the truth.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhen I offered to carry you?\u201d he tries, weakly.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian thinks harder, his heart pounding. \u201cCold Pond Cave, and then the lanterns \u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLan Zhan,\u201d Wei Wuxian says, his treacherous voice starting to shake a little. \u201cYou can\u2019t mean that \u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cKeep guessing,\u201d Lan Wangji says softly, rubbing his hand up and down Wei Wuxian\u2019s arm in soothing circles.</p>\n<p>\u201cSurely it can\u2019t be that month in the library, or in class,\u201d Wei Wuxian says. \u201cI was such a shit to you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou were,\u201d Lan Wangji agrees, \u201cand the answer is still no.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIs this fun for you?\u201d Wei Wuxian says in a wobbly voice. \u201cAre you trying to make me cry?\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji gazes at him with heartbreaking fondness. His thumb sweeps tenderly under one of his eyelids. \u201cPlease don\u2019t cry.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe roof,\u201d Wei Wuxian whispers. \u201cHere in the Cloud Recesses, that first night?\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji doesn\u2019t say anything to this, but his silence answers him. Wei Wuxian feels like an earthquake has rocked him to the core.</p>\n<p>\u201cLan Zhan, since then?\u201d he asks. It comes out choked. \u201cBut \u2014 but you \u2014 you were so angry that night, you hated me so much \u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWei Ying is oblivious,\u201d Lan Wangji repeats, but he says it so gently that it sounds like a love declaration.</p>\n<p>\u201cLan Zhan, you...ridiculous\u2026\u201d Wei Wuxian kisses him again, a fierce press to his lips, and Lan Wangji sways into it with a soft noise. \u201cWhat were you going to do about it if this hadn\u2019t happened, huh? Stay silent forever while I stupidly missed out on all of this?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI did not think\u2026\u201d Lan Wangji says, then closes his eyes, a furrow drawing between his brows. \u201cI did not think it was a possibility. I couldn\u2019t...imagine that you...\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLan <em> Zhan,</em>\u201d Wei Wuxian protests. \u201cI like you so much! I\u2019ve never kept that a secret. I\u2019ve had a crush on you for ages \u2014 you know that\u2019s what people mean when they flirt, right?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWei Ying flirts with everyone,\u201d Lan Wangji points out, again fairly.</p>\n<p>\u201cBut I flirt with you the <em> most. </em>Obviously.\u201d Wei Wuxian sniffs, his eyes still feeling watery. \u201cNo, it\u2019s my fault. I\u2019m bad at this kind of thing, I\u2019m really awful at it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Lan Wangji says firmly, which is so obviously untrue, but the fact that he says it anyway makes Wei Wuxian\u2019s heart swell. He squishes Lan Wangji\u2019s cheeks in a sudden fit of affection, then kisses his nose like he did earlier in the cave.</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji just gazes at him patiently as he does it, his gaze so hearth-warm that something melts in Wei Wuxian like butter in the sun.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou should mark your words, Lan Zhan,\u201d Wei Wuxian warns, nestling his face into Lan Wangji\u2019s neck. He latches on to him with all four limbs to illustrate his next point, tangling their bodies together even further. \u201cYou\u2019re going to end up stuck with me forever, and then you\u2019ll regret it when I cling like a burr to you and won\u2019t leave you alone.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPlease,\u201d Lan Wangji says, heartfelt, \u201cnever leave me alone,\u201d and Wei Wuxian obviously can\u2019t do anything else in response to that but kiss him again, and again.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u2014</p>"
