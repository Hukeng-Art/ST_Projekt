  "text": "<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<span>Langa got his first love letter when he was twelve. A fresh-faced seventh grader, he was pulled to the back of the school after classes and confessed to by some girl in his science class. He didn\u2019t know her name. Even after she poured her heart out for him, he still failed to remember her face.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span>\n<em>\n<span>\u201cLanga, do you want to, um, go on a date?\u201d</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span>\n</em>\n<span>He never really understood the appeal behind dating. Love never really resonated with him. He was pretty sure he fell in love with his food more often than another girl his age. Besides, he was way too focused on snowboarding; he was pretty sure there was no girl who\u2019d get that enough.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span>\n<span>So, as a seventh grader with the emotional depth of a kiddie pool, Langa didn\u2019t sugarcoat the truth. </span>\n<em>\n<span>\u201cNot really.\u201d </span>\n</em>\n<span>After a second, he added, </span>\n<em>\n<span>\u201cwho are you, again?\u201d</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span>\n</em>\n<span>He never did learn her name after she ran away in tears, and he never really gave the rejection a second thought. He read the letter because his mom told him to at least spare some of her feelings, but his opinion didn\u2019t change even after reading it. It sounded like a lot of those flouncy romance novels he read in English class, about true love and soulmates and whatever.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span>\n<span>Langa wasn\u2019t necessarily a pessimist (he wasn\u2019t really an anything-ist; his dad always told him that his skull was too thick to get philosophical), but he seriously didn\u2019t understand how this love stuff was even remotely interesting.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span>\n<span>But the love letters didn\u2019t stop. Three weeks later, another girl confessed to him the same way. And two months after that, another asked if he was single through text. When he said yes, she jumped on the chance like a panther. </span>\n<em>\n<span>Wanna go to the movies with me this Saturday?</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span>\n</em>\n<em>\n<span>Not really, </span>\n</em>\n<span>Langa replied, just like how he responded to the last two offers from the other two girls.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span>\n<em>\n<span>Are you busy? </span>\n</em>\n<span>she asked with a teary-eyed emoji.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span>\n<em>\n<span>No, I just don\u2019t really feel like going on a date with you. </span>\n</em>\n<span>After that, he never got a text back.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span>\n<span>Around Valentines day, Langa\u2019s locker was covered in notes, all of which taped onto the door like paper hearts. He could barely open the door itself, that\u2019s how crowded it was. Some of the boys nearby gave him death glares, but he simply didn\u2019t acknowledge them.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As always, he read every letter, but none of them stuck out to him. The next day, he gathered all the girls in a group chat and rejected them in one single instance, through text. He was the grade\u2019s most hated guy by the female population for a week. Langa, ever the clueless, wasn\u2019t even aware of this.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In eighth grade, six girls confessed to him. Ninth grade, seven. Tenth grade, ten. Eleventh grade, thirteen. To every single one, Langa gave the same dry, cut-to-the-chase, </span>\n<em>\n<span>\u201cnot interested.\u201d </span>\n</em>\n<span>Kids began to wonder if Langa was already dating someone in secret. Maybe his girlfriend went to a different school. Maybe he was in a relationship so taboo, he couldn\u2019t make it public. Boys specifically speculated that Langa wasn\u2019t even a human being. He must\u2019ve been an alien, devoid of love, the very best part of being alive. A heartbreaker, was how his peers collectively viewed him.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 When Langa moved to Okinawa, during his first week, he opened his locker and a letter cascaded down. It was from a girl who asked him to meet her behind the school. As if he hadn\u2019t learned anything from the first love note, he followed her request. When he approached her, she bowed swiftly and announced. </span>\n<em>\n<span>\u201cHasegawa-san, I like you!\u201d</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019ve been here for a week,\u201d </span>\n</em>\n<span>Langa said, confused. How can you like someone you barely know?</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI-I know, but, well, I can\u2019t explain it, really. I just like you! When I see you, my heart races!\u201d </span>\n</em>\n<span>She bowed again, even deeper this time. </span>\n<em>\n<span>\u201cPlease at least consider the confession! I don\u2019t mind waiting for your response!\u201d</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cSorry,\u201d </span>\n</em>\n<span>responded Langa. He remembered how his mom told him to let the girls down easy with an apology. </span>\n<em>\n<span>\u201cI don\u2019t like you back, if that\u2019s how you define \u2018liking\u2019 someone.\u201d</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The next day, despite the girl crying and messily saying sorry for wasting his time, Langa forgot her face. Even without this snowboarding business taking up space in his brain, he\u2019s just not built for love.</span>\n</p>\n<p><br>\n<br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\n<span>\ud83d\udc8c</span>\n</p>\n<p><br>\n<br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>This love letter given to him this temperate February afternoon, Langa originally expected, was going to be like the rest of them.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span>\n<span>It would probably quote a cheesy line from a novel aimed for fourteen year old girls involving a dreamboat boy and an unrealistic happily ever after. It would probably have a heart drawn on it, whether that be near the author\u2019s name or near Langa\u2019s. It would probably be paragraphs and paragraphs long, as if Langa hung the stars in the sky. Seriously, what is up with that? Langa is just another teenage boy, and he can\u2019t even read a lengthy paragraph before getting bored.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span>\n<span>He always reads the letters, but he\u2019s grown desensitized to the contents. He sort of feels bad about being so indifferent, but he really just doesn\u2019t care. Women don\u2019t appeal to him, not even the prettiest ones, and he doesn\u2019t particularly find \u201cable to write a poetic love confession\u201d a very incredible skill in a significant other.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span>\n<span>But this love letter, stuffed haphazardly into his locker, slightly crinkled at the envelope\u2019s corners, is actually </span>\n<em>\n<span>not</span>\n</em>\n<span> just like the rest of them.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span>\n<span>For one, there\u2019s no writing on the actual envelope. It doesn\u2019t read </span>\n<em>\n<span>To: Langa </span>\n</em>\n<span>like nearly all of them do. There\u2019s a heart sticker, no surprise, but it\u2019s sort of peeling off. No, it looks like it\u2019s been actively scratched off, then reattached, then mildly scratched off again. It doesn\u2019t stick right, and there\u2019s sticky residue and scrapes along the texture.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span>\n<span>Back in his room after a long day of school, Langa opens the envelope and unfolds the paper. He notices that the paper is crumpled ever so slightly. Clearly the writer balled it up, ready to throw it away, before thinking twice and smoothing it out again. The edges of the letter are coming undone a bit.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span>\n<span>Strange, Langa knows, but these are all nothing compared to the final clue. If he really wanted, he could ignore all these signs, but he can\u2019t ignore the last one.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span>\n<span>The love letter is two sentences long. There isn\u2019t even a </span>\n<em>\n<span>Dear Langa, </span>\n</em>\n<span>that\u2019s how short it is. It covers approximately 10% of the paper\u2019s surface area.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span>\n<span>The sentences get straight to the point. </span>\n<em>\n<span>I have a crush on you. Isn\u2019t that awful? </span>\n</em>\n<span>It\u2019s written in striking red, in an almost illegible handwriting.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span>\n<span>There\u2019s no signature.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span>\n<span>For the first time in Langa\u2019s life, he cares about a love confession.</span>\n</p>\n<p><br>\n<br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\n<span>\ud83d\udc8c</span>\n</p>\n<p><br>\n<br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\"I got a love letter yesterday.\"</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Langa's best friend, Reki, remains unfazed as he eats his lunch. They eat lunch together and practice ollies with their skateboards; it's simple and easy. Today, Reki is wearing a pink graphic hoodie under his school jacket, another in his large, large stash of uniquely dorky hoodies that he can\u2019t seem to part from.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Reki picks at an octopus wiener in his bento before shoving it in his mouth and shrugging. \"So?\"</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"I want to know who wrote it,\" Langa replies.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"You get confessed to like, every day, dude.\" Reki makes a face. \"It's annoying.\"</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Langa tilts his head. \"Annoying?\"</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"When Sato-chan confessed to you three days ago, everyone in our class saw it from our window. You guys were right there. It's like you're shoving it in our lonely, no-girlfriend faces.\"</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"Who's Sato-chan?\" Langa racks his brain for a Sato-chan, but his mind comes up blank. He was seriously confessed to three days ago?</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Reki looks at him in terror. It's like he's seen a ghost, and Langa knows first-hand how terrified his friend is of the supernatural. \"I can't believe you don't even remember any of the girls! You're brutal, Langa!\"</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"I just don't really care about this stuff.\"</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"You could at least do the girls a favor and remember their names!\"</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Langa thinks about this for a second. Yeah, he probably could afford to do that. He only remembers Reki\u2019s name down pat, and the ones who participate in \u201cS\u201d races with him. Sometimes even their names elude him. \u201cWell, the person who confessed to me yesterday didn\u2019t even write who they were.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Reki perks up at that. \u201cYeah?\u201d He glances over, interest peaked. \u201cYou got an anonymous confession?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cSeems so.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThis isn\u2019t just you not knowing their name because you\u2019ve got the memory span of a goldfish?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI don\u2019t have the memory span of a goldfish,\u201d Langa rebuttals, unamused. \u201cBut yeah, they didn\u2019t sign it. They didn\u2019t even give me a number so I can text them my reply.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cHuh.\u201d Reki stares for a moment longer before returning to his lunch. There\u2019s a look on his face that Langa can\u2019t read, but to be completely honest, Langa\u2019s never been good at reading cues. He moves entirely on instinct, and right now his instinct isn\u2019t giving him any signs of life. \u201cWell, whoever it ends up being, you shouldn\u2019t get your hopes up.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 That\u2019s weird of Reki to say. Reki standards for his own love life shoot through the roof, even though he\u2019s never been confessed to and it\u2019s a sore topic for him. \u201cWhy\u2019s that?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Reki shrugs again with a cheeky smile. \u201cYou\u2019d reject them anyway, wouldn\u2019t you? Anyway, wanna practice some ollies?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p><br>\n<br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\n<span>\ud83d\udc8c</span>\n</p>\n<p><br>\n<br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Miya is the second person Langa tells about this phenomenon, but it\u2019s not like he actively chose Miya. Miya is like fourteen and probably doesn\u2019t know any more about romance than Langa does himself. But when the younger skater points out that Langa\u2019s head is in the clouds instead of on the \u201cS\u201d track, he accidentally lets slip his internal dilemma. \u201cSomeone gave me a love letter and I\u2019m trying to figure out who gave it to me,\u201d he says, dazed, like a complete idiot.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span>\n<span>\u201cWhat?\u201d Miya replies with a snort. They\u2019re sitting against a wall, cooling down after their race. He has his orange and green Switch out because he\u2019s like fourteen years old. \u201c</span>\n<em>\n<span>That\u2019s </span>\n</em>\n<span>why you lost beautifully to me? You were thinking about some silly love letter?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span>\n<span>Langa watches as Reki and Shadow sling petty taunts at each other as they straddle the starting line. \u201cI didn\u2019t </span>\n<em>\n<span>lose beautifully </span>\n</em>\n<span>to you. I only lost by about a meter.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span>\n<span>\u201cStill a terrible loss in my book.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span>\n<span>Langa resists the instinctual urge to yank Miya\u2019s rat tail. \u201cIt\u2019s none of your concern. I\u2019ll find the writer soon enough.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span>\n<span>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you know who wrote it?\u201d asks Miya with a frown, eyes never leaving his Switch screen. \u201cThey wrote you a letter specifically for you. They didn\u2019t give it to you in person?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span>\n<span>\u201cNope.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span>\n<span>\u201cAnd they didn\u2019t even sign it?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span>\n<span>\u201cYup.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span>\n<span>Miya lets out a petite \u201cugh\u201d sound. When Langa looks over, he is making a rather disgusted face. The game he\u2019s playing is paused. \u201cThen what was the point in the first place?

The increase in volume causes Langa to jump a bit, even though he\u2019s sitting on his knees. \u201cSome are actually trying to take this matter seriously.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span>\n<span>\u201cHey, I\u2019m taking this just as seriously as you!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 He and Cherry sit across from Langa, a low table between them in Cherry\u2019s work building. Who knows why Joe\u2019s visiting? It wasn\u2019t exactly Langa\u2019s intention to get his perspective; he really only asked Cherry since he does calligraphy and likely knows the intricacies behind writing a note. Langa hasn\u2019t really staked a lot of effort on figuring out what their relationship is, exactly, but it\u2019s not much of his business.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThis isn\u2019t some sort of nitpicky job resume, it\u2019s a love letter,\u201d Joe snarks, taking the sheet of paper from Cherry\u2019s hands. He\u2019s wearing his chef outfit, which just looks incredibly jarring in Langa\u2019s opinion. He\u2019s used to seeing Joe wearing a simple shirt just barely covering his exposed abs. \u201cWhat matters more is the content, not whatever presentation stuff you\u2019re paying attention to.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI think both are pretty important,\u201d Langa says quietly.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Joe holds up a hand. \u201cAh-ah-ah; I hate to play this card, but out of everyone here, I believe I\u2019m most qualified to speak on relationships and confessions and anything remotely romantic.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Cherry scoffs daintily. \u201cAs if, mister playboy.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 One of Joe\u2019s eyebrows twitches. \u201cShut your trap, </span>\n<em>\n<span>Kaoru. </span>\n</em>\n<span>At least I\u2019ve actually been with a </span>\n<em>\n<span>real woman, </span>\n</em>\n<span>and not some creepy AI lady.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201c</span>\n<em>\n<span>Take that back!</span>\n</em>\n<span>\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOr what, will your very real Carla give me a very real punch in the face for insulting her very real feelings?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou better sleep with one eye open, </span>\n<em>\n<span>Kojirou--</span>\n</em>\n<span>\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cUm, hey,\u201d Langa interrupts with a cough. \u201cCan we get back to the letter?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span>\n<span>The two men briefly cease ripping at each other's throats. \u201cRight, the note,\u201d Joe says. \u201cWell, what I noticed from the writing was that whoever wrote it seems to be ashamed of liking you. Y\u2019know, like having a crush on someone you have a complicated relationship with, or someone who\u2019s way outta your league...\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span>\n<span>\u201cI hate to agree with him, but the presentation seems this way as well,\u201d Cherry notes, but not without a stealthy glare in Joe\u2019s direction. Joe doesn\u2019t seem to react to it. \u201cThe individual must be aware of what confessing to you entails. They\u2019ve shown clear signs of wanting to backtrack, but ended up powering through.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span>\n<span>It\u2019s likely for the better that neither of them know Langa\u2019s reputation when it comes to confessions. \u201cSo who do you think wrote it?\u201d he asks.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span>\n<span>Joe cups his chin with his hand, deep in thought. \u201cYou mean, who specifically? Or do you mean what </span>\n<em>\n<span>kind </span>\n</em>\n<span>of person?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span>\n<span>\u201cUh, either or, I guess.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span>\n<span>\u201cI don\u2019t know any kids your age,\u201d he says, shrugging, \u201cso I can\u2019t say I can give you a solid candidate.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span>\n<span>\u201cPerhaps a less popular, less liked student in your school is the culprit,\u201d Cherry offers. \u201cThe author of this letter could have low self-esteem, so they equate confessing to you as a shot in the dark.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span>\n<span>At that, Joe suddenly slams his hands against the table. \u201cShy girls! Shy girls always write the most unconventional stuff, and they\u2019re too shy to say how they feel out front! That\u2019s why love letters are their go-to method! That\u2019s it, Langa - your mysterious writer\u2019s just some shy girl who\u2019s afraid to confront you head-on!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span>\n<span>\u201cNot necessarily,\u201d Cherry starts to debate, but Joe slaps a hand over his mouth before he finishes his thought.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span>\n<span>\u201cWho else could it be, </span>\n<em>\n<span>Kaoru?</span>\n</em>\n<span>\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span>\n<span>The other man flushes frustratedly, shoving Joe\u2019s hand away. \u201cOne, I </span>\n<em>\n<span>told </span>\n</em>\n<span>you not to call me that. Two, it could be anyone, really--\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span>\n<span>\u201cShy girls,\u201d Langa says under his breath. Thinking back, from the girls he </span>\n<em>\n<span>can </span>\n</em>\n<span>remember, none of them were particularly shy people. He retrieves the letter again and takes another glance at the sentences. </span>\n<em>\n<span>I have a crush on you. Isn\u2019t that awful? </span>\n</em>\n<span>In all of his now-eighteen years alive (yes, he spends his eighteenth birthday on this mystery), he\u2019s never crushed on a girl. Maybe the girl who wrote this love letter is different.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll try asking shy girls. Thanks for your help.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span>\n<span>\u201cWait,\u201d Cherry calls after him, but Langa is already out the door.</span>\n</p>\n<p><br>\n<br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\n<span>\ud83d\udc8c</span>\n</p>\n<p><br>\n<br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Langa doesn\u2019t know any shy girls. He doesn\u2019t really know any girls, period, and certainly not by name. But Reki knows, probably, so before class the next Monday he confronts his best friend. \u201cHey, who are the shy girls in our school?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span>\n<span>Reki looks up from his notebook. \u201cHuh?\u201d He\u2019s sketching out a new design that he\u2019ll undoubtedly put on a new board. It looks like it\u2019s of a gorgon monster with four eyes. It might be a commission.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Langa notes that Reki sticks out his tongue a lot when he\u2019s focused. He wants to poke it.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span>\n<span>\u201cYou know girls, don\u2019t you? You know the shy ones?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span>\n<span>\u201cSure I know girls,\u201d Reki responds with a huff, perhaps pridefully. He leans back in his seat. \u201cI know all the girls. Girls love me.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span>\n<span>If that\u2019s the case, Langa wants to know why Reki doesn\u2019t get approached by any of them, but he doesn\u2019t ask because that\u2019s not important right now.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span>\n<span>\u201cShy girls,\u201d Reki taps his eraser against his chin. \u201cAsano-san is pretty shy, I think. She\u2019s in class 2-B and has dark brown hair in a bob cut. Ichikawa-san, too, who\u2019s also in 2-B. There\u2019s a girl from third year who\u2019s pretty notorious for being super shy around people; I think her name is Mihara-something? Oh, and Konno-san! She doesn\u2019t really speak much, but she\u2019s nice. She helped me with homework once.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span>\n<span>\u201cI don\u2019t know any of them,\u201d Langa replies, deadpan.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span>\n<span>Reki knits his brows together, face just as deadpan. \u201cKonno-san is in </span>\n<em>\n<span>our </span>\n</em>\n<span>class. She sits four seats in front of you.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span>\n<span>\u201cShe does?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span>\n<span>\u201cYou\u2019re hopeless.\u201d He goes back to his board design. \u201cWhy do you ask all of a sudden?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span>\n<span>\u201cJoe said that the unknown person behind that letter is probably a shy girl,\u201d Langa says, returning to his seat. The teacher has just entered the class, so the break must be over. \u201cSomeone who\u2019s too self-conscious to put a name to their writing, so they left it anonymous.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span>\n<span>\u201cOh.\u201d Reki stops sketching for a short second.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span>\n<span>\u201cBut thanks; I\u2019ll go ask those girls later today.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span>\n<span>His friend chews on the pencil eraser. He\u2019s quiet, a bit uneasy.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cReki?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYeah.\u201d Reki smiles, and it looks a tiny bit dejected, but it could just be Langa\u2019s eyes failing him. Is he jealous? Not sure; Langa\u2019s never been good at reading people. \u201cNo problem.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p><br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHello,\u201d Langa starts as he traps a girl before him. He thinks it\u2019s called a \u201ckabedon\u201d, where you press someone\u2019s back against a wall and lean over them with your supported arms. Reki taught him it once - he said it\u2019s crucial for a clich\u00e9 romance scenario. It makes all the girls swoon. And probably forfeit information. The latter is what Langa\u2019s after.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span>\n<span>The girl before him -- Asano? Ichikawa? Girl from third year? Konno? -- squeaks in embarrassment, face flooded with blush. \u201cH-Hello!\u201d she hushes, eyes wandering.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span>\n<span>\u201cCan I ask you something?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span>\n<span>\u201cA-Anything!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span>\n<span>Langa holds up the letter. \u201cDid you write this?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span>\n<span>The shy girl, whatever her name is, takes a peek through her fingers. At the sight of the note itself, she lowers her hands and frowns. \u201cNo. What\u2019s this?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span>\n<span>\u201cSomeone gave this to me. Did you?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span>\n<span>\u201cNo,\u201d she repeats, more antsy now than bashful. Her eyes scan the words and her expression only grows more uncomfortable. \u201cUm, is this s-supposed to be weird? Because this is weird.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span>\n<span>She scurries out from under Langa\u2019s arms and runs away.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span>\n<em>\n<span>Weird? </span>\n</em>\n<span>Langa wonders. </span>\n<em>\n<span>I guess it kind of looks like a killer\u2019s note before they murder me.</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span>\n</em>\n<span>Maybe that\u2019s the situation he\u2019s in right now. Maybe he\u2019s a hitman\u2019s target. (\u201cYou\u2019re not a hitman\u2019s target,\u201d Reki reassures him with a raised eyebrow, as if to say \u201creally?\u201d. \u201cNothing crazy like that ever happens here.\u201d)</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span>\n<span>He tries another girl. Again, he doesn\u2019t know her name, but he has a feeling it\u2019s Asano, since she does fit the physical description Reki gave him earlier. Dark bob cut, big doe eyes that look watery no matter what Langa tells her. She stands like she\u2019s about to be mugged, but there\u2019s pink on her cheeks and she\u2019s watching expectantly, so she\u2019s probably aware that Langa isn\u2019t actually going to jump her.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span>\n<span>\u201cDid you write this?\u201d he asks again, and when Possibly-Asano glances at the sheet of paper, she shakes her head silently. \u201cReally?\u201d She shakes her head harder this time.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span>\n<span>The third girl Langa tries, Reki is nearby for moral support. Whether or not he\u2019s supporting Langa\u2019s endeavors or the girl for being emotionally attacked by a pretty boy is up for question. \u201cI didn\u2019t write that,\u201d the girl responds airily, like her voice can\u2019t go above a whisper.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span>\n<span>\u201cDo you know if any of your friends did?\u201d Langa urges.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span>\n<span>\u201cNo, sorry,\u201d she says, even quieter.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span>\n<span>\u201cThis isn\u2019t working,\u201d Reki finally decides after Langa has confronted nearly thirty different girls in the span of three days, each resulting in failure. \u201cClearly the writer isn\u2019t a shy girl.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span>\n<span>\u201cJoe lied to me,\u201d Langa mumbles, defeated.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span>\n<span>Reki scoffs. \u201cNo, Joe\u2019s just a total blockhead. You know he\u2019s never the one who breaks up with his girlfriends, right?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span>\n<span>\u201cThey break up with </span>\n<em>\n<span>him?</span>\n</em>\n<span>\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span>\n<span>\u201cYeah, because he\u2019s really stupid and doesn\u2019t understand women.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span>\n<span>\u201cAnd you\u2019re any better?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span>\n<span>\u201cOkay, </span>\n<em>\n<span>rude.</span>\n</em>\n<span>\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span>\n<span>Langa sighs. \u201cWell, what now?\u201d The note in his hand has grown more worn and wrinkled the more he grips it. It\u2019s starting to look more like scrap than an actual letter. The writing is wearing off, and Langa has read it so many times it\u2019s practically etched into his brain. \u201cIf a shy girl didn\u2019t write this, then who wrote it?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span>\n<span>With a roll of his eyes, Reki goes, \u201cthere\u2019s more people in this world than shy girls.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span>\n<span>\u201cCherry said something about less popular kids...\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span>\n<span>Langa pouts, eyes focused on the writing. </span>\n<em>\n<span>I have a crush on you. </span>\n</em>\n<span>If they really liked him so much to use up a whole paper sheet for a love letter, why wouldn\u2019t they sign it? </span>\n<em>\n<span>Isn\u2019t that awful? </span>\n</em>\n<span>If they really thought confessing to him was this bad, why would they do it against all warnings?</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span>\n<span>He hears snapping in front of his eyes. He blinks, vision refocusing. Reki juts his head to the street. \u201cC\u2019mon, let\u2019s go already!

She\u2019s all alone and stuff and my dad used to give her flowers yearly, so I thought I\u2019d keep up the tradition.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span>\n<span>\u201cOh,\u201d Langa says. \u201cThat\u2019s very sweet of you.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span>\n<span>\u201cIt\u2019s nothing.\u201d Reki grins, \u201cI\u2019m just a very sweet person!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p><br>\n<br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\n<span>\ud83d\udc8c</span>\n</p>\n<p><br>\n<br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Outside of \u201cS\u201d related activities, Langa doesn\u2019t really interact with Shadow. He doesn\u2019t buy flowers because he\u2019s allergic to pollen, he has no reason to interact with an older man for his own personal gain, and frankly, he\u2019s never fully comfortable knowing that Shadow\u2019s skateboarder persona and his florist persona are basically two different people.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span>\n<span>The bell above the door chimes brightly as Langa and Reki enter the shop. \u201cYo, Shadow!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span>\n<span>\u201c</span>\n<em>\n<span>Shhh!</span>\n</em>\n<span>\u201d Shadow hisses, head turning like a top as he steals a quick glance at his coworker. She\u2019s a pretty lady tending to an older customer. \u201cNot in this holy establishment! I\u2019m Higa here, got it? How many times do I gotta tell you?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span>\n<span>\u201cWhoops.\u201d Reki doesn\u2019t look sorry.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span>\n<span>\u201cAnyway,\u201d he grumbles, clearing his throat, \u201cwhat\u2019re you two doing here? \u2018Specially Langa. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever seen you here for flowers.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span>\n<span>\u201cI\u2019m just tagging along,\u201d Langa says with zero enthusiasm. He sneezes into his fist. The place is covered in flowers, which is a nightmare for Langa\u2019s sense of smell.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span>\n<span>\u201cI\u2019m buying flowers for my mom,\u201d Reki says with much more enthusiasm. \u201cA bouquet of red roses, please!\u201d Shadow grunts before getting to work, plucking several roses from the section behind him.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span>\n<span>Langa scrunches his face. \u201cRed roses for your mom?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span>\n<span>Reki groans. \u201cThey\u2019re her favorite flowers, and my dad would buy them for Valentine\u2019s day. Stop making it creepy.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span>\n<span>\u201cI\u2019m not the one buying--\u201d Langa sneezes again-- \u201cred roses for my mom.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span>\n<span>\u201cI will </span>\n<em>\n<span>beat you up, </span>\n</em>\n<span>Hasegawa Langa</span>\n<em>\n<span>.</span>\n</em>\n<span>\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span>\n<span>Before Langa is given a chance to retort, Shadow finishes the bouquet. \u201cAdded some buds here and there to make it look fuller,\u201d he says like it\u2019s an afterthought. The stems are wrapped in delicate wax paper, tinted yellow and pink. \u201cTwo-thousand yen.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span>\n<span>Reki fishes through his wallet and plinks down a good amount of yen coins. They\u2019re a variety ranging from one yen to one hundred. \u201cHere ya go!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span>\n<span>Shadow rings up the purchase as Reki snatches the flowers from his hand, but not before he notes Langa\u2019s downcast expression, staring like an airhead at the different types of blossoms. \u201cSomething up, Langa?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span>\n<span>\u201cI really have no idea why people fall in love,\u201d Langa sighs.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span>\n<span>\u201cAre you bitter about Valentine\u2019s day or something?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span>\n<span>\u201cIt\u2019s so painful and useless.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span>\n<span>Shadow doesn\u2019t say anything for a minute as he hands Reki back his change, before going, \u201cI feel that, man.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span>\n<span>Langa returns his attention to Shadow, and oh. Um. There\u2019s already tear tracks running down his face. His bottom lip is wobbling. For such a terrifying skateboarding opponent, Shadow\u2019s quite the softie.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span>\n<span>\u201cFinally, someone gets it,\u201d the older man says, breath shaky. He presses a hand against his heart woefully. \u201cLove is the cruelest game of all. My manager over there, you see her? She\u2019s the loveliest flower in this entire store, but she\u2019ll never love an ogre-looking fool like me! I\u2019m pretty sure she\u2019s got a boyfriend already! Everything is hopeless!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span>\n<span>\u201cWhat is happening,\u201d Reki comments, quizzical.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span>\n<span>Langa sneezes.</span>\n</p>\n<p><br>\n<br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\n<span>\ud83d\udc8c</span>\n</p>\n<p><br>\n<br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>It\u2019s Valentine\u2019s day, Langa\u2019s least favorite holiday. It\u2019s a new progression. At first he didn\u2019t really like it because he\u2019d get bombarded with confessions without knowing how to respond to them properly, then he didn\u2019t like it because he\u2019s </span>\n<em>\n<span>expected </span>\n</em>\n<span>to care about it because all the other girls cared about it. Toss in white day\u2019s connection in Japan and it just feels ridiculously overbearing.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span>\n<span>Now, Langa hates it because he\u2019s got this romantic mystery on his hands and no solution in sight. None of the girls who confessed to him before wrote this letter, shy girls didn\u2019t write this, nobody\u2019s stepping up to the plate as the true author of the note, and he\u2019s successfully wasted a week of blind searching.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span>\n<span>(Also, he got nine letters in his locker and a buttload of chocolates. He doesn\u2019t even like sweets that much, and now his entire night is going to be dedicated to sludging through paragraphs and paragraphs of soap opera level stuff.)</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span>\n<span>Langa isn\u2019t naturally a pessimist, but he\u2019s starting to think that maybe he\u2019s getting there. Cynicism sounds so appealing at the moment.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span>\n<span>After his last class, he\u2019s asked to help put away books. He tells Reki not to wait up for him; it might take a while. When he\u2019s finally done, the sun hangs lower in the sky and almost all the students are off the premises.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span>\n<span>He leaves through the front door, where a girl kicks off the wall and approaches him. \u201cHasegawa-kun, can I talk to you real quick?\u201d She\u2019s hiding something behind her back, and Langa\u2019s pretty sure he knows where this is going. This note will equal ten whole confession notes that he\u2019ll have to read tonight...</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span>\n<span>\u201cSure,\u201d he says despite knowing how this ends. And besides, it\u2019d just be rude of him to not let her say anything at all.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span>\n<span>She clears her throat before aggressively pressing a letter into Langa\u2019s chest. \u201cPlease read my confession to you!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Oh, he will. Even though this girl remains nameless in Langa\u2019s head, he reads every letter. He peels the envelope off his clothes and takes a cursory look-over. On the envelope reads </span>\n<em>\n<span>To: Hasegawa Langa. </span>\n</em>\n<span>The heart sticker is stuck on confidently. It\u2019s creaseless, so sharp on the ends that it could give clean papercuts.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span>\n<span>Without thinking, even though he knew the answer, Langa asks, \u201cYou weren\u2019t the person who wrote that two-sentence love letter from a week ago, were you?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span>\n<span>\u201cUh, no? This is my first letter to you, unless you want more in the future.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOh. Then sorry, but I\u2019m not interested.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span>\n<span>\u201cWha-- </span>\n<em>\n<span>hey!</span>\n</em>\n<span>\u201d Nameless-san takes a step closer in indignation. Her auburn hair reaches the small of her back, and the shadows from the afternoon sun sprinkle across her face. She\u2019s cute, Langa guesses. It\u2019s a shame her face runs as nothing special in his head. \u201cCan\u2019t you at least read what I wrote and consider it? I put a lot of effort into it!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span>\n<span>Langa blankly stares at her. From the way she demands expectations from him, she </span>\n<em>\n<span>definitely </span>\n</em>\n<span>didn\u2019t write the legendary two-sentence love letter from a week ago. \u201cI\u2019ll read it,\u201d he says, because he always does. He reads every letter.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span>\n<span>\u201cGood!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span>\n<span>\u201cBut, uh, remind me,\u201d he adds with a mental apology to Reki for not knowing Nameless-san\u2019s actual identity, \u201cwho are you, again?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span>\n<span>Nameless/Faceless-san freezes. She slowly sucks in a breath. \u201cHasegawa-kun, we\u2019re in the same class.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span>\n<span>\u201cWe are?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span>\n<span>She clenches her teeth and takes yet another step forward. They\u2019re actually so close, Langa feels the need to step back again. \u201cWe\u2019ve been in the same class since the school year started, and you </span>\n<em>\n<span>don\u2019t remember me?</span>\n</em>\n<span>\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span>\n<span>Langa gulps. Right, won\u2019t an apology help in this scenario? \u201cUh, sorry--\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span>\n<span>\u201c</span>\n<em>\n<span>You really are heartless!</span>\n</em>\n<span>\u201d she cries at last. \u201cAll the rumors about you being a stone-cold heartbreaker are true! All those rumors about you caring about nobody because nobody is good enough for you are </span>\n<em>\n<span>true!</span>\n</em>\n<span>\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span>\n<span>Langa, ever the clueless, thinks, </span>\n<em>\n<span>there are rumors about me?</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span>\n</em>\n<span>Before he can respond, she slaps him across the face. The slap stings like hell, and it\u2019s so strong, Langa almost loses his balance. His cheek throbs, and when he tries looking forward again to offer yet another empty apology, she slaps him again on the same cheek.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span>\n<span>\u201cOw,\u201d Langa chokes.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span>\n<span>\u201cDon\u2019t even bother responding to the letter,\u201d Nameless/Faceless/Can-pack-a-punch-san sobs, big globby tears rolling down her face. \u201cBetter yet, just burn it! It\u2019ll probably warm your cold, dead heart!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p><br>\n<br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\n<span>\ud83d\udc8c</span>\n</p>\n<p><br>\n<br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Langa finds Reki on his way back home. He\u2019s out at the empty skatepark doing ollies. He\u2019s always been really good at them. The way he jumps with his board kind of looks like a bird taking flight.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span>\n<span>In both of Langa\u2019s hands are two separate letters. Of course, one of them is Nameless/Faceless/Can-pack-a-punch-san\u2019s, and the other is the cursed one that\u2019s putting Langa through this hell. He pockets the first one and plans to throw the second one in the trash--</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span>\n<span>Reki spots him and waves. \u201cYo! How was putting away those books-- </span>\n<em>\n<span>whoa!</span>\n</em>\n<span>\u201d He boards over, expression worried. \u201cDude, you\u2019re bleeding!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span>\n<span>\u201cYeah,\u201d says Langa lowly.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span>\n<span>\u201cYour skin\u2019s cracked! Sit down, I\u2019ll patch you up!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span>\n<span>Langa sits, cross-legged. He leans against the skate park\u2019s fencing as Reki sits before him on his knees. As a skateboarder, he\u2019s always got a handy-dandy first-aid kit around. He pulls out the disinfectant, cotton swabs, and a roll of gauze. \u201cI don\u2019t have any bandaids left, so you\u2019re gonna have to deal with this.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span>\n<span>\u201cYeah,\u201d says Langa again, even lower. A cotton swab brushes against his cuts and he winces. \u201cOw.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span>\n<span>\u201cSorry,\u201d hums Reki, and he really does look sorry. \u201cHow\u2019d you get this?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span>\n<span>\u201cSome girl slapped me twice.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span>\n<span>\u201cOh yeah?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span>\n<span>\u201cShe confessed to me and then when I rejected her, she slapped me.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span>\n<span>Reki laughs under his breath. \u201cGirls should just stop trying. There\u2019s no getting through to you. Let me guess, you didn\u2019t remember her name?\u201d Langa nods. Reki clicks his tongue. \u201cYeeaaahhhh.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span>\n<span>\u201cI guess it is pretty awful having a crush on me,\u201d Langa whispers as he gingerly holds that crumpled up note. The bleeding red glare back, as if the words are disappointed in him. Yeah, he\u2019s pretty disappointed in himself right now, too. \u201cI really do hurt everyone who tries confessing.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span>\n<span>\u201cYeah, you do,\u201d Reki responds with a roll of his eyes, like it\u2019s obvious. It actually is, in fact, very obvious. Langa\u2019s just so dense, he hasn\u2019t noticed it until now. Reki tells Langa to stay still, which he does. It\u2019s not like he\u2019s itching to move right now, anyway.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span>\n<span>Shortly after, he feels a makeshift bandage press against his cheek. It sticks easily. \u201cThere, good as new.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span>\n<span>Langa sighs. \u201cThanks.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span>\n<span>Reki pinches Langa\u2019s nose and he lets out a quiet yelp. \u201cC\u2019mon, quit looking so mopey. At least now that you know that your words affect others, you can grow from your mistakes.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span>\n<span>\u201cI guess.\u201d Since his nose is still being pinched, it sounds nasal. </span>\n<em>\n<span>I gehss. </span>\n</em>\n<span>Langa continues when Reki lets go. \u201cI should just give up on finding the author of this letter. Obviously they don\u2019t want me knowing who they are. Otherwise, they would\u2019ve signed it. Man, I\u2019m a total jackass.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span>\n<span>He and Reki sit, across each other, for a good moment in the quiet sunset. Langa keeps rereading the two sentences, head down. His brain can\u2019t get enough of this emotional pain, this horrible realization that he\u2019s the king of oblivious jerks. </span>\n<em>\n<span>I have a crush on you. Isn\u2019t that awful?</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span>\n</em>\n<em>\n<span>I have a crush on you. Isn\u2019t that awful?</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span>\n</em>\n<em>\n<span>I have a crush on you.

Isn\u2019t that--</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span>\n</em>\n<span>\u201cHey,\u201d Reki says at last, snapping Langa out of his vicious cycle. Langa looks up and Reki\u2019s eyes are square on his, though they look fidgety, if eyes can look fidgety. \u201cYou </span>\n<em>\n<span>really </span>\n</em>\n<span>wanna know who wrote that letter?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span>\n<span>\u201cYeah,\u201d Langa responds earnestly, though wilted. He looks down again and absentmindedly tries flattening the crinkles against his knee. \u201cWhy, do you know who?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span>\n<span>From the corner of his vision, Langa sees Reki purse his lips. \u201cUh-huh.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span>\n<span>It takes one moment for Langa to process that. His head shoots straight up and he squawks in betrayal. \u201cWait, you knew the person and you didn\u2019t tell me?!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span>\n<span>\u201cYou said it yourself! They didn\u2019t sign it for a reason!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span>\n<span>\u201cSo you made a promise to them that you wouldn\u2019t tell me or something?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span>\n<span>\u201cWell, yeah, kind of...\u201d Reki presses his thumbs together, lacing his remaining digits. His hands are trembling. Maybe he\u2019s cold. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t really an actual promise made, but uh, sort of. Yes, there was, but no, there wasn\u2019t? It\u2019s complicated, actually, because it wasn\u2019t really like a verbal promise? It wasn\u2019t written either, or even explicitly said to me in any way, but it was kinda just... y\u2019know, a promise. Kinda expected of me to keep this a secret, really.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span>\n<span>\u201cYou\u2019re not making sense,\u201d Langa says bluntly.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span>\n<span>\u201c</span>\n<em>\n<span>Just gimme a second, okay?</span>\n</em>\n<span>\u201d Reki grumbles before shoving his face in his hands. Now, his expression remains a mystery behind his fingertips. \u201cI\u2019m breaking the promise, so I need to mentally prepare myself for the worst.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span>\n<span>The worst? Reki\u2019s just the messenger. Langa isn\u2019t so heartless to the point where he\u2019d shoot the messenger too.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span>\n<span>Reki moves his hands so Langa can see his features again, and it\u2019s rosy. Rosier than usual, at least. \u201cLook, the reason why you couldn't find this mysterious writer is because you didn\u2019t ask the right people.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span>\n<span>\u201cI asked Cherry,\u201d Langa mentions with a confused frown. \u201cAnd Joe...\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span>\n<span>\u201cYou didn\u2019t ask </span>\n<em>\n<span>me.</span>\n</em>\n<span>\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span>\n<span>\u201cWas I supposed to?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span>\n<span>Reki huffs, \u201cwell, yeah. I\u2019m always around you, being the bestest friend you could ever have. I\u2019m, um, your closest person. Don\u2019t you think my opinion matters, too?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span>\n<span>Langa blinks. \u201cDuh.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span>\n<span>\u201c</span>\n<em>\n<span>I\u2019m saying, </span>\n</em>\n<span>I\u2019ve kind of, um, been waiting for you to kinda just, well, talk to </span>\n<em>\n<span>me </span>\n</em>\n<span>about it. Because I know you best, so, well, the person who wrote that... I would\u2019ve known them, y\u2019know? I would\u2019ve known them really well. </span>\n<em>\n<span>Really </span>\n</em>\n<span>really well, because I know you really really well. And I care about you a lot. And because it\u2019s you, I would\u2019ve helped you. I would\u2019ve said yes.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span>\n<span>\u201cOkay, I\u2019m lost.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span>\n<span>\u201c</span>\n<em>\n<span>Oh my god, </span>\n</em>\n<span>read in between the lines, idiot!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span>\n<span>Reki grabs Langa\u2019s hand and curls in the pinky, ring, and middle finger, so they\u2019re pressed snuggly against his palm. He then aims the extended pointer finger at himself, at his chest. His own hands, holding Langa\u2019s, are warm to the touch. \u201c</span>\n<em>\n<span>I </span>\n</em>\n<span>wrote that stupid letter, alright?!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span>\n<span>Langa stares at his hand. It kind of looks like he\u2019s shooting Reki\u2019s heart with a finger gun, like Cupid shooting his arrow.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span>\n<span>\u201cLike, as a joke?\u201d he asks, since his processor runs as slow as Internet Explorer.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span>\n<span>\u201cAs a </span>\n<em>\n<span>confession.</span>\n</em>\n<span>\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span>\n<span>\u201cA real confession?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span>\n<span>\u201cYou think I\u2019m the kind of guy to write a love letter to someone I don\u2019t even like?!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span>\n<span>\u201cYou like me.\u201d Langa likes the way that rolls off his tongue, but only when it\u2019s about Reki. He couldn\u2019t give two cares if some girl in his grade professes her undying love, but suddenly when it\u2019s about Reki, Langa\u2019s pretty sure the metronome in his own heart is speeding up.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span>\n<span>He\u2019s never felt this way before about someone. It\u2019s totally weird, but experiencing it for the first time is kind of mindblowing, too.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span>\n<span>\u201cYou </span>\n<em>\n<span>like </span>\n</em>\n<span>me,\u201d he repeats, and yeah, he really does love the way it sounds. \u201cAnd you think that\u2019s awful?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span>\n<span>Reki\u2019s face is almost as red as the dipping sunset behind them. It\u2019s cute, Langa realizes, and this time the cuteness doesn\u2019t escape him. \u201cYou rejected literally every single person who\u2019s confessed to you since you moved here. You don\u2019t even give them a good reason, you just don\u2019t like them. Why would I be any different?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span>\n<em>\n<span>Because you\u2019re Reki, </span>\n</em>\n<span>Langa wants to say. \u201cBut you confessed anyway.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span>\n<span>\u201cMight as well shoot my shot, right? I didn\u2019t think you\u2019d care enough to go looking for the writer.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span>\n<span>So all those moments when Langa brought up the letter near Reki, and Reki growing tense, quiet, unnatural, weren\u2019t because he was jealous, but because it was about </span>\n<em>\n<span>him?</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span>\n</em>\n<span>Wow. Langa really </span>\n<em>\n<span>is </span>\n</em>\n<span>stupid.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span>\n<span>\u201cAnyway,\u201d Reki mutters, \u201cyou got your answer, so stop looking.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span>\n<span>\u201cI only just started,\u201d Langa argues. Reki\u2019s face goes even redder. The blush stretches to his ears and his neck like a sunburn. A cute sunburn. \u201cI kinda like what I see.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span>\n<span>\u201cYou are </span>\n<em>\n<span>legally not allowed to say that to me,</span>\n</em>\n<span>\u201d Reki hisses in a panic.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span>\n<span>\u201cI\u2019m saying you\u2019re cute.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span>\n<span>\u201cDon\u2019t say that stuff if you don\u2019t like me!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span>\n<span>\u201cWho said I don\u2019t like you?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span>\n<span>Reki shuts up. His face is a full-blown cherry now, lips parted in surprise. Hesitantly, he adds, \u201clike me, as in more-than-a-friend.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span>\n<span>That sounds nice, being more than a friend to Reki. Reki is cute and sweet and buys flowers for his mom and taught him how to skateboard all those months ago and hell, </span>\n<em>\n<span>he cares about skateboarding. </span>\n</em>\n<span>Reki </span>\n<em>\n<span>cares. </span>\n</em>\n<span>He made him a freaking skateboard. He likes Langa for everything Langa is, not just his looks or his height. He knows about Langa\u2019s thick skull, his irrational stubbornness, his blatant dismissiveness and his kiddie-pool-deep emotions, and </span>\n<em>\n<span>still </span>\n</em>\n<span>likes him.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span>\n<span>And Langa thinks he likes Reki back, even though he\u2019s a boy and he wears tacky hoodies and headbands and sometimes acts almost defensively brash. He\u2019s cocky, but only for show; he\u2019s humbler than he looks.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span>\n<span>\u201cYeah,\u201d Langa replies honestly. \u201cI like you as more-than-a-friend. Wanna be more than my friend?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span>\n</em>\n<span>\u201cSeriously?\u201d Reki asks, voice cracking.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span>\n<span>\u201cYeah,\u201d Langa responds, smiling.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span>\n<span>\u201cYou like me over all those other girls who\u2019re way prettier than me, who wrote full-fledged sonnets for you?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span>\n<span>\u201cYeah.\u201d Langa presses his forehead against Reki\u2019s, and whatever shelter they\u2019ve got together is warm. Their hands fold together, and Langa likes this, whatever this is. It\u2019s not snowboarding, skateboarding, food, or anything he\u2019s loved in the past, but he loves it just as much. Maybe even more.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span>\n<span>Okay, so perhaps falling in love isn\u2019t so useless after all.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span>\n<span>\u201cBecause you\u2019re Reki. How could I </span>\n<em>\n<span>not </span>\n</em>\n<span>like you?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>"
