  "summary": "<p>Over the years, Yennefer notices that Geralt and Jaskier\u2019s life can be really bloody weird at times.</p>\n<p>Alternative summary: five Geraskier fandom tropes that our boys find completely normal, and one that isn\u2019t at all.</p>",
  "notes": "<p>Okay, this fandom is tropey as fuck, and don\u2019t get me wrong, I love it, but it\u2019s just hilarious to me how we have so many versions of the same story! This isn\u2019t intended to bash anyone at all, far from it - I\u2019ve written most of these tropes myself, in one form or another. (Hurt!Jaskier, anyone??) So this fic is my self-indulgent way of poking fun at our collective fandom obsession with there only being one bed, with sharing baths, and with Geralt getting turned into a wolf. Among other things!</p>\n<p>Edit: There is now a podfic of this fic available <a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/23216701\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>, by the wonderful reena_jenkins!</p>",
  "text": "<p>\n<i>one.</i>\n</p>\n<p>Yennefer is in Novigrad, browsing a pile of expensive furs at a market stall. The furrier keeps eyeing her not-so-subtly, trying either to peer down her cleavage or to figure out whether or not she\u2019s going to buy anything, but she\u2019s unperturbed: she runs her fingers through a snow-white pelt that feels like fox fur, then says, \u201cHow much for this one, and for the mink?\u201d </p>\n<p>The furrier picks up the fox, hefts it thoughtfully. \u201cOne hundred for this one,\u201d she says, and \u201cfifty for the mink. But for you? Together?\u201d He deliberates showily. \u201cOne twenty-five, all in.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cOne hundred for both,\u201d Yennefer says flatly. </p>\n<p>\u201cOne twenty.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cOne hundred,\u201d Yennefer repeats, \u201cand I won\u2019t tell the last couple who bought from you that that glorious wolf pelt they\u2019re going to show to their fancy friends is actually from a stray dog you caught on the harbour front two days ago.\u201d </p>\n<p>The furrier eyes her. \u201cOne ten.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cDone,\u201d Yennefer says, and hands over the coin. </p>\n<p>It\u2019s nearly evening, now, the summer sun sliding down low in the sky, and Yennefer makes her way through the narrow, cobbled streets to a tavern with the surprisingly evocative name of The Whispering Wind. She\u2019s heard rumours that there\u2019s a white-haired Witcher staying here, fresh from some adventure or other in the countryside around the city, and, well, she only knows one white-haired Witcher. </p>\n<p>Heat stirs in the pit of her stomach. </p>\n<p>The innkeeper of The Whispering Wind greets her with a respectful nod when she enters his establishment. \u201cMadam Sorceress,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s an honour that you have graced me with your patronage. How may I help you?\u201d</p>\n<p>The obsequiousness grates Yennefer\u2019s teeth. \u201cGeralt of Rivia is staying here,\u201d she says, not a question. \u201cWhere is he?\u201d</p>\n<p>The innkeeper struggles for a second, then clearly realises that there\u2019s not much point in arguing privacy laws with Yennefer of Vengerberg. \u201cUpstairs,\u201d he says. \u201cThe room at the end of the corridor.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Yennefer says, offering him a smile. \u201cAnd a glass of Est Est, please.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wine in hand and furs thrown over her shoulder, Yennefer climbs the stairs. There\u2019s a single corridor of rooms up here and she steps casually along to the end, heels snapping against the wooden boards. She doesn\u2019t bother knocking on the door at the end, just turns the handle and opens it, knowing that, whatever state of undress Geralt is in, he\u2019ll be happy to see her. </p>\n<p>The door opens, and she blinks. </p>\n<p>Geralt\u2019s in the bath. In and of itself, that\u2019s not particularly surprising: he\u2019s a Witcher, he gets dirty, therefore he needs to bathe more regularly than most otherwise he gets\u2026 a little ripe. And not all baths can be the bath that Yennefer shared with him in Rinde, marble-sculpted, set into the floor, large enough for five or six people if you squashed together \u2013 so currently Geralt is in The Whispering Wind\u2019s wooden tub, barely long enough for him to stretch out his legs, his arms resting along the wooden edges, scarred skin bare to the warm air. </p>\n<p>And his bard is in the tub with him. </p>\n<p>Both men look up as Yennefer opens the door, confusion on the bard\u2019s face, wariness on Geralt\u2019s. Both melt into identical expressions of surprise when they see its her \u2013 and, to be honest, Yennefer imagines she\u2019s probably wearing a similar expression herself, because they\u2019re sharing a bath? Close enough that their knees must be touching? Suds in the bard\u2019s hair, a cloth in the Witcher\u2019s hand? </p>\n<p>\u201cYen?\u201d Geralt says, making no move to get out of the bath. </p>\n<p>His bard eyes her with his usual trepidation. \u201cIf she comes any closer, I\u2019m going to need you to protect my virtue, Geralt,\u201d he says, full of his usual sarcasm, then goes back to rinsing out his hair. </p>\n<p>Geralt just hums, still frowning at Yennefer. \u201cDo you need something?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re sharing a bath,\u201d Yennefer says, tone oddly flat. \u201cWith the bard.\u201d</p>\n<p>The bard snorts. \u201cI have a name.\u201d </p>\n<p>Geralt seems confused. \u201cI shared a bath with you in Rinde,\u201d he points out. </p>\n<p>The bard wags a finger at her. \u201cThere\u2019s no more room in this tub,\u201d he says. \u201cIf you want to wash, Georgi downstairs is a lovely chap. I\u2019m sure he\u2019d be happy to organise you another.\u201d </p>\n<p>Why are they acting like this is completely normal? Two grown men who, as far as Yennefer is aware, aren\u2019t sleeping together, crammed together in a bathtub that\u2019s barely big enough for one \u2013 and they\u2019re acting like <i>she\u2019s </i>the weird one. </p>\n<p>Yennefer figured she\u2019d come find Geralt, have a few rounds of fantastic sex, then go back to her life. She wasn\u2019t prepared to deal with whatever the fuck is going on here. </p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m staying at The Golden Hind, Geralt,\u201d she says. \u201cIf you want, come find me after you\u2019re done washing your bard.\u201d </p>\n<p>The bard makes an offended noise. \u201cOne, I\u2019m not his bard,\u201d he snaps, turning round in the bath to face Yennefer more fully. \u201cTwo, my name is Jaskier, and you must be the only member of high society who doesn\u2019t know that. Three, I wash myself, thank you very much. Four, if anyone gets washed in these situations, it\u2019s Geralt. Five? Go away, witch, and leave us to our bath in peace.\u201d </p>\n<p>Yennefer rolls her eyes, turns her back, and leaves them to their bath. </p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<i>two. </i>\n</p>\n<p>The woods outside Vengerberg are quiet this early in the morning, the only sounds the birds singing merrily in the trees and the soft trickle of a nearby brook. Yennefer is rummaging through the undergrowth, searching for a particular strain of purple-flowering yarrow that she <i>swears</i> used to grow around here when she was young \u2013 although, admittedly, that was several decades ago now, so it\u2019s entirely possible that it\u2019s died out by now. It\u2019ll be perfect for the spell she\u2019s working on, though, so she keeps on looking. </p>\n<p>After a little while, a new sound breaks through the peace of the trees. The clopping of hooves, slow and languorous, accompanied by the soft strumming of some kind of stringed instrument \u2013 and then, floating over the top, the stop-start singing of someone in the middle of composing a song. </p>\n<p>Yennefer gets to her feet, cracks her shoulders, and heads towards the road. She\u2019s met Geralt\u2019s bard enough times by now that she recognises his voice \u2013 and she knows their pattern well enough to know that where you find the bard, you usually find the Witcher, too. </p>\n<p>The path through the Vengerberg woods is narrow and rutted, mainly used by wagons trying to avoid the better maintained toll road a few miles to the east and by travellers who like to take the scenic route. Currently, there\u2019s a single horse trotting towards Yennefer, a single horse led by a single man wearing a doublet made of an exceptionally bright yellow silk. It\u2019s Jaskier, of course, his forehead creased as he mumbles to himself, fingers fluttering across the strings of his lute \u2013 and Yennefer frowns, because she recognises the horse walking behind him as Geralt\u2019s horse, but Geralt himself is nowhere to be seen. </p>\n<p>\u201cWitch!\u201d Jaskier greets brightly, finally catching sight of her. \u201cWhat brings you here on this fine spring day? Lying in wait for us in the woods?\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cHardly, bard,\u201d Yennefer says, faintly amused despite herself. \u201cThis is Vengerberg. I\u2019ve been living here.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAh, of course,\u201d Jaskier nods, plucking a cheery chord from the strings of his lute. \u201cThe wandering witch who always comes home in the end. There\u2019s probably a song in that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, there isn\u2019t,\u201d Yennefer says flatly. \u201cWhere\u2019s Geralt? Or have you just stolen his horse?\u201d </p>\n<p>At which point, a wolf with dazzlingly white fur and gleaming golden eyes emerges from behind the bard and the horse. Yennefer\u2019s heart thuds so loud in her ears for a second that she can barely breathe, but then Jaskier glances down at the wolf with an affectionate expression and she sees that it has the horse\u2019s halter gripped in its jaws \u2013 and, oh, shit. \u201cGeralt?\u201d she asks, a little strangled. </p>\n<p>The wolf makes a rumbling sound in its throat and looks up at Jaskier. </p>\n<p>\u201cPresent and accounted for,\u201d Jaskier says, surprisingly chirpy given that apparently his friend has been turned into a wolf. </p>\n<p>Yennefer stares at them. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cI would have thought that was fairly obvious,\u201d Jaskier says. \u201cGeralt got turned into a wolf.\u201d Wolf-Geralt makes a noise halfway between a howl and a growl. \u201cBy a sorcerer,\u201d Jaskier clarifies, seemingly in response, \u201cwho\u2019d had a bit too much to drink and thought it would be funny.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cSo you came to find me?\u201d Yennefer asks. \u201cTo turn him back?\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cNah, it\u2019ll wear off in a week or so,\u201d Jaskier says. \u201cIt usually does.\u201d He\u2019s interrupted by Geralt nudging at his ankle, and he looks down, says, \u201cWhat?\u201d As Yennefer watches, more than a little confused, Geralt props his paws up on Jaskier\u2019s thigh and presses the horse\u2019s halter into his hand, then jumps down and comes to sniff at the hem of Yennefer\u2019s dress. He circles her a few times, still sniffing, then howls quietly and goes back to Jaskier, who promptly hands the halter back. </p>\n<p>The horse just stands there, quietly unimpressed by the whole thing. </p>\n<p>Yennefer finds her tongue. \u201cUsually?\u201d she echoes. \u201cHas this happened before?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOnce or twice,\u201d Jaskier says, then Geralt rumbles again and he adds: \u201cTo both of us. Although I tend to get turned into a bird. You know, because I\u2019m a bard? It\u2019s songbirds and larks for me, wolves for Geralt.\u201d He sniffs. \u201cNever let it be said that the Continent\u2019s sorcerers lack originality.\u201d </p>\n<p>Yennefer frowns. \u201cYou don\u2019t seem particularly worried by this.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cShould I be?\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cGeralt is currently a wolf,\u201d Yennefer says flatly. \u201cI would think that would be a <i>little</i> concerning.\u201d </p>\n<p>Jaskier shrugs again. \u201cI suppose you can get used to anything,\u201d he says, and looks down at Geralt. \u201cWouldn\u2019t you agree?\u201d Wolf-Geralt makes that rumbling noise again, and Yennefer realises with a start that it\u2019s the lupine version of his usual hum. \u201cQuite,\u201d Jaskier says, then flashes Yennefer a smile. \u201cIf it\u2019s alright with you, Lady Sorceress, I\u2019ve got a performance booked a couple of towns over. We need to get going.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cSure,\u201d Yennefer says. \u201cYou sure you don\u2019t want me to turn him back?\u201d</p>\n<p>Geralt growls, yellow eyes bright. </p>\n<p>\u201cBetween you and me, I think he actually quite likes being the wolf,\u201d Jaskier says. \u201cHe\u2019s always pretty grumpy after he turns back. Grumpier than usual.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cRight,\u201d Yennefer says slowly. </p>\n<p>\u201cWell, we\u2019ll see you around!\u201d Jaskier says, and wanders off down the path through the Vengerberg woods. Geralt trots along at his heels, leading his horse\u2014who is remarkably unperturbed by the whole scenario\u2014and Yennefer stands there for a long moment, hands on her hips, yarrow forgotten, just watching them go. </p>\n<p>The next time she meets them, Geralt is riding along the road to Cintra with a brightly-coloured songbird perched on his shoulder, trilling happily in the warm evening air. </p>\n<p>Yennefer doesn\u2019t even bother asking. </p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<i>three. </i>\n</p>\n<p>\u201cThis will do,\u201d Geralt says, hood pulled up over his head as some paltry protection against the driving rain. He turns Roach\u2019s head towards the tavern, towards the brightly-lit windows and the sound of muted chatter, and Yennefer pulls her cloak tighter around herself and nudges her grey palfrey in the same direction. Jaskier\u2019s trudging beside them on foot, mud splattered up his typically weather-inappropriate green silk trousers, and it\u2019s indicative of quite how exhausted he is that he doesn\u2019t say a word. </p>\n<p>Yennefer will just be glad to get out of these wet clothes as soon as possible. </p>\n<p>The tavern is rickety and shambling, a small handful of locals sitting inside and a sign advertising an even smaller handful of rooms for hire. \u201cOnly one left, I\u2019m afraid,\u201d the owner says, handing Geralt a rusty iron key. \u201cThere\u2019s a fireplace, though, and a few logs. Should warm you up after the storm.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Geralt says, nodding slightly. Jaskier still hasn\u2019t spoken, Yennefer realises, huddled silently under his cloak, and he follows Geralt towards the stairs, lute bumping carelessly against his back. </p>\n<p>Yennefer pauses at the bar for a moment, hands the owner another few coins. \u201cAle for them, wine for me, food for all of us,\u201d she says, and the owner nods his acquiescence. </p>\n<p>The room is small but surprisingly clean, and by the time Yennefer arrives Geralt\u2019s already got a fire going in the grate. Jaskier strips off his wet clothes wordlessly, then, just in his smallclothes, sits as close to the merrily crackling fire as he can, slowly rubbing feeling back into his skin, flushed red from the cold. \u201cFuck,\u201d he finally grinds out through chattering teeth. \u201cThat\u2019s the last time we go hunting drowners in storm season, Geralt.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cHe has a point,\u201d Yennefer quips, settling her bags down beside one of the room\u2019s two narrow single beds. \u201cYou were both about to end up drowned yourself before I stumbled across you.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cSee?\u201d Jaskier says, not looking away from the fire. \u201cThe witch agrees. I must be on to something.\u201d </p>\n<p>Geralt is unbuckling his armour, piling it in a corner and then shucking the worst of his wet clothes. The room is starting to smell distinctly fusty so Yennefer twitches her fingers, whispers a spell, and dries off their clothes with a thought. She shouldn\u2019t really use her magic for such trivial purposes, not when she\u2019s as tired as she is, but she has no desire for the bard to catch a damn cold and spend the next few days sniffling and complaining. He\u2019s only human, after all. </p>\n<p>There\u2019s a knock at the door, and a barmaid appears with a tray. She brings them two ales, a glass of red wine that\u2019s actually not that disgusting, and three bowls of pottage, thick and oily. They eat ravenously, Jaskier still pretty much naked, Geralt shirtless, Yennefer perfectly put together, of course, but she has the benefit of magic so she\u2019s not going to unduly criticise them. The food is filling, the drink alcoholic, and before long the tension of the cold has all but left Yennefer\u2019s bones. Now, she\u2019s just tired. </p>\n<p>\u201cWe should sleep,\u201d Geralt says, setting his bowl aside. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a long journey tomorrow, and the storm doesn\u2019t look like it\u2019ll let up any time soon.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGreat,\u201d Jaskier grumbles. \u201cMore rain.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yennefer cocks an eyebrow. \u201cMaybe if you wore more appropriate clothes?\u201d she jibes, but there\u2019s no real heat behind it. </p>\n<p>\u201cSays you, black velvet dress with a white lace trim,\u201d Jaskier jibes back, just as toothless. There\u2019s a lick of humour in his eyes. \u201cI just don\u2019t have the ability to magically dry my clothes with a click of my fingers.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cMaybe you should have thought of that in advance,\u201d Yennefer suggests. \u201cBesides, I dried your clothes, too.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cTrue,\u201d Jaskier says, and meets her gaze. \u201cThanks for that.\u201d </p>\n<p>It\u2019s unexpectedly sincere. Yennefer is going to chalk that up to the bard being too tired for his own good. \u201cI\u2019m having this bed,\u201d she says, taking a seat on the worn blankets and starting to remove her boots. \u201cYou two can fight over the other one.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s room for both of us,\u201d Geralt says, similarly kicking his boots into the corner. </p>\n<p>Jaskier\u2019s already digging himself in under the blankets, drawing them up around his ears. His mussed, still-damp hair is a birds nest across the pillow, but Geralt doesn\u2019t seem particularly fazed as he settles in alongside his bard. Yennefer watches, surprised, as they fit themselves together in the narrow space: Geralt\u2019s arm is around Jaskier\u2019s shoulders, Jaskier\u2019s hand slung across Geralt\u2019s waist, their legs clearly tangled together under the blanket. It\u2019s almost frighteningly intimate, and\u2014<i>again</i>\u2014they\u2019re treating it like it\u2019s the most normal thing in the world. </p>\n<p>As far as Yennefer knows, they\u2019re still not fucking. </p>\n<p>Geralt glances over at her. \u201cYen?\u201d he asks. \u201cYou okay?\u201d </p>\n<p>Jaskier\u2019s head rises from Geralt\u2019s chest. \u201cYou do look a little peaky,\u201d he says, frowning. \u201cDo sorceresses get colds?\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d Yennefer answers, slipping beneath the blankets of her own bed. \u201cGo to sleep, bard.\u201d </p>\n<p>Jaskier huffs, but after a moment his head drops back down to rest on Geralt\u2019s chest. He\u2019s dozing in seconds, his breath slowing, features lax \u2013 and Yennefer spends a long, long moment watching Geralt, as he accommodates Jaskier\u2019s sleeping twitches, as his arm wraps more securely around Jaskier\u2019s shoulders, as the expression on his face softens, just a little. </p>\n<p>Yennefer thinks she might be starting to understand. </p>\n<p>\u201cYen?\u201d Geralt asks, barely audible over the crackling of the fire. </p>\n<p>\u201cNothing,\u201d Yennefer says, swathes herself in the threadbare blankets, and goes to sleep. </p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<i>four. </i>\n</p>\n<p>Yennefer\u2019s sharing a jug of vinegary wine with Jaskier in a tavern in Temeria. This has become a surprisingly unsurprising event in her life, lately, and\u2014not that she\u2019d ever admit it\u2014but she\u2019s actually starting to enjoy the bard\u2019s company. He\u2019s funny, once you get past the idiocy and crassness, and loyal to a fault. She\u2019s seen him smash more than one ceramic tankard over the head of the latest farmhand who dared insult the White Wolf in his hearing. </p>\n<p>It\u2019s almost endearing. </p>\n<p>Jaskier\u2019s in the middle of a rambling anecdote involving the Countess de Stael and six chickens when the door to the tavern smashes open and Geralt comes thudding in. There\u2019s blood on his face and something that looks like viscera in his hair, and he slams a hunk of hair and flesh down on the alderman\u2019s table, says, \u201cIt\u2019s done.\u201d </p>\n<p>The alderman fumbles with the promised purse, but Geralt just snatches it out of his hand and comes towards Jaskier and Yennefer\u2019s table. Which is when Yennefer notices it: there\u2019s a tension thrumming through his body, electric and frantic, pulsing in his eyes and his gait and his breathing. </p>\n<p>Still seated across from her, Jaskier sighs sharply and finishes off his wine. \u201cAgain?\u201d he asks, high-pitched and a little petulant. \u201cThis is the third time this month, Geralt.\u201d </p>\n<p>Geralt just makes a little animal noise in the back of his throat, fists his hand in the neck of Jaskier\u2019s doublet, and drags him bodily up the stairs to their room. Jaskier doesn\u2019t seem too surprised about this turn of events, for some reason \u2013 which really should have warned Yennefer, to be honest, because the things that this pair find normal are just so deeply, intimately <i>not </i>that she\u2019s sort of given up trying to figure them out. </p>\n<p>She follows them upstairs anyway. </p>\n<p>Their room is across the hall from hers, the door still open. She goes in and closes it behind her, then studies Geralt warily, the sallow paleness of his skin, the hitching of his breath. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you?\u201d she asks. </p>\n<p>Geralt bares his teeth. \u201cIncubus.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yennefer frowns, but Jaskier just barks a laugh. \u201c<i>Again? </i>That\u2019s the same as last week!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of incubi around at the moment,\u201d Geralt grinds out. He\u2019s bent over, hands gripping his thighs so tight it makes Yennefer\u2019s hands hurt in sympathy. </p>\n<p>Jaskier sighs. \u201cWhich way around?\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cYou to me,\u201d Geralt answers shortly. </p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll get the oil,\u201d Jaskier says, and starts rummaging around in his pack. </p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Yennefer asks, a little sharply. </p>\n<p>Jaskier glances up at her as, somewhat unexpectedly, Geralt starts pulling his armour off with jerky motions. \u201cGeralt got bitten by an incubus,\u201d he says, matter of fact and straightforward. \u201cDon\u2019t know how familiar you are with this particular magical subspecies, my dear sorceress, but the effect an incubus\u2019 bite has on a Witcher of Kaer Morhen is, well, fatal. Heart palpitations, vomiting, death. That kind of thing.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s dying?\u201d Yennefer asks, taking a stumbling step forward. </p>\n<p>\u201cNope,\u201d Jaskier answers, \u201cbecause I have the cure!\u201d He retrieves a stoppered vial of oil from his pack, brandishes it like a weapon. \u201cYou may want to leave the room for this bit.\u201d </p>\n<p>Yennefer eyes the vial. \u201cIs it magical?\u201d </p>\n<p>Jaskier snorts. \u201cOh, I think so,\u201d he says brightly. \u201cIt can surely cast a mighty spell. It\u2019s mesmerising, you might say, when unsheathed.\u201d </p>\n<p>Geralt groans, full of pain and something else that Yennefer can\u2019t immediately identify. \u201cThe cure,\u201d he growls, \u201cis for him to fuck me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLike I said,\u201d Jaskier says. \u201c<i>Magical</i>.\u201d </p>\n<p>Geralt is by this point completely naked. He kneels on the bed, gripping the sheets with shaking hands, and Jaskier, apparently unfussed by Yennefer\u2019s presence, gets to work, unstoppering the vial and slicking up his fingers. Geralt lets loose a guttural moan as Jaskier spreads him open with a brisk, practical efficiency that tells Yennefer quite clearly that this isn\u2019t the first time he\u2019s done this. \u201cHow many times has this happened?\u201d she asks.</p>\n<p>Jaskier doesn\u2019t glance up from his task, three fingers buried in Geralt\u2019s arse. \u201cYou lose count after a while,\u201d he says. \u201cAlthough it has been ridiculous lately. Seriously, Geralt, you know there are easier ways to get me into bed than poisoning yourself every few weeks?\u201d </p>\n<p>Geralt just makes an incoherent noise. </p>\n<p>Jaskier withdraws his fingers, unlaces his trousers, and glances at Yennefer. \u201cAre you just going to watch?\u201d he asks. \u201cNot that I mind, but it\u2019s a bit weird that you\u2019re just standing there like that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<i>Jaskier</i>,\u201d Geralt barks. </p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, sorry,\u201d Jaskier says, strokes his hard cock a few times with oil-slick fingers, and proceeds to fuck Geralt with a precision and attentiveness that Yennefer didn\u2019t expect. Geralt comes astonishingly quickly, groaning his orgasm into the pillows, momentarily silent \u2013 and Yennefer frowns. \u201cIs that it?\u201d she asks. \u201cIs he cured?\u201d </p>\n<p>Jaskier laughs, cheeks flushed, still pretty much fully dressed. \u201cNot exactly,\u201d he says, still buried deep in Geralt\u2019s arse. \u201cWith an incubus\u2019 bite, it\u2019s usually a four or five orgasm kind of thing. Certain aphrodisiac pollens it\u2019s just one or two, and we came across this big worm monster once whose saliva was seven\u2014gods, that was a long day\u2014but an incubus is going to take a bit more work than this. It\u2019ll probably take most of the night.\u201d </p>\n<p>Yennefer blinks. \u201cYou\u2019re going to fuck him all night?\u201d</p>\n<p>Jaskier shrugs. \u201cI\u2019ll fuck him a few times, and then he\u2019ll probably turn it round on me for a bit. A few handjobs, maybe a blowjob. Whatever he needs.\u201d His voice is oddly soft towards the end. </p>\n<p>\u201cWhatever he needs,\u201d Yennefer echoes. </p>\n<p>\u201cYou going to stick around?\u201d Jaskier asks. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to worry about him, Yennefer. He\u2019s in safe hands.\u201d </p>\n<p>Geralt moans, voice rough. \u201cJaskier,\u201d he says, needy, trusting. </p>\n<p>Jaskier strokes his hand down Geralt\u2019s back. \u201cJust hold on,\u201d he says soothingly. \u201cYou\u2019ll be okay. I\u2019ve got you.\u201d \u2013 and it\u2019s bizarre and absurd, a bard medically fucking a Witcher to save his life, but at the same time it\u2019s so intimate that Yennefer feels like she\u2019s intruding. </p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll leave you to it,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019ll be across the hall if you need me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jaskier flashes her a smile. \u201cThanks, witch,\u201d he says, jokingly affectionate. </p>\n<p>\u201cAny time, bard,\u201d Yennefer responds, and means it. </p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<i>five. </i>\n</p>\n<p>\u201cJaskier\u2019s been taken.\u201d </p>\n<p>Geralt\u2019s rigid in the doorway to her house in Novigrad, shoulders hunched, jaw set. His eyes are wide and wild, yellow as the setting sun, and Yennefer knows without a second\u2019s pause that he needs her help. \u201cWhen?\u201d she asks, ushering him inside, closing the door behind him. </p>\n<p>\u201cI last saw him in the market two days ago,\u201d Geralt says, gruff and taught. \u201cI was leaving the city to go on a hunt, and he said he\u2019d meet me back in the inn tonight.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s not there?\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s not there,\u201d Geralt says, and throws a folded slip of parchment on the table. \u201cThis was.\u201d </p>\n<p>Yennefer picks it up, and she doesn\u2019t need to be a Witcher to know that the fingerprints smeared across the folds are made in blood. She unfolds it. \u201cTomorrow morning, the Harsdan graveyard,\u201d she reads. \u201cFive hundred crowns.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s his handwriting,\u201d Geralt says tightly. \u201cAnd it\u2019s his blood.\u201d </p>\n<p>Yennefer frowns. \u201cHow do you know?\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cI know the smell.\u201d </p>\n<p>There\u2019s something halfway between tragic and comic in that admission, but this isn\u2019t the time to address it. \u201cThey made him write his own ransom note.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cThey often do,\u201d Geralt says tightly. </p>\n<p>Yennefer frowns at him, then decides to come back to that later. \u201cDo you have any idea where they took him?\u201d she asks. </p>\n<p>Geralt shakes his head. \u201cI was hoping you could track him,\u201d he says. \u201cWith the blood. It\u2019s relatively fresh, only a few hours old.\u201d </p>\n<p>Yennefer grimaces. \u201cBlood magic is unpredictable,\u201d she says. \u201cI can\u2019t guarantee an accurate location.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t have to be accurate,\u201d Geralt says. \u201cGive me an area of the city, and I can track his scent. I\u2019ve done it before.\u201d </p>\n<p>Yennefer pauses, stares at him. \u201cYou\u2019ve rescued Jaskier from kidnappers before?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSeveral times,\u201d Geralt says, like it\u2019s obvious. </p>\n<p>Yennefer sighs. \u201cOf course you have,\u201d she says, and gets to work. </p>\n<p>The spell indicates an area of Novigrad known for its criminality and its lack of common sense \u2013 the exact kind of place where the idiots who decided to try to extort a Witcher would live. Yennefer goes with Geralt, trading her fur stole for a tough leather coat, and watches as he practically sniffs his way around the narrow streets, stalking like he\u2019s tracking his prey. Which, in a way, Yennefer supposes, he is. </p>\n<p>Geralt\u2019s hackles raise, and he stops in the middle of an alleyway, head turning towards a low, dark door tucked away in the corner. </p>\n<p>\u201cGeralt?\u201d Yennefer asks quietly. </p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s hurt, Yen,\u201d Geralt says shortly, and an unexpected surge of worry rises in Yennefer\u2019s heart. \u201cBadly.\u201d He bares his teeth. \u201cThey were never planning on giving him back to me alive.\u201d </p>\n<p>Yennefer takes a breath. \u201cGo to him,\u201d she says, and feels her fists tighten at her sides. </p>\n<p>She stays back as Geralt barrels in through that low, dark door, stays in the street as the screams and shouts come pouring out from inside, stays in the street as the violence comes to a halt, stays in the street until she hears Geralt\u2019s bellowed, \u201c<i>Yen</i>.\u201d Then she goes inside, because she knows better than to get in the way of Geralt when he\u2019s going after someone he, what? Travels with? Lives with? Shares meals and beds and baths with? </p>\n<p>It only takes Yennefer a glance to see that Jaskier is in a bad way. He\u2019s unconscious, slumped against Geralt\u2019s shoulder, blood pouring from three neat stab wounds in his body, one in his shoulder, one in his arm, and one in his thigh. It\u2019s the thigh wound that\u2019s the problem, gushing rather than oozing, which means whatever careless blade was driven in there probably nicked an artery. \u201cShit,\u201d Yennefer bites off, kneels beside the fading bard, and gets to work. </p>\n<p>The energy required to stem the flow of the blood, to close the seam of the artery, to knit the flesh back together, is considerable. Yennefer can\u2019t do it all at once, not by herself, so she gets to the point where the wound in his leg is a raw, bloody gash that isn\u2019t going to make him bleed out, and then stops. \u201cBack to my house,\u201d she says, catching her breath, blood on her hands. \u201cHe\u2019s stable, now, but we need to see to his other wounds. This place isn\u2019t exactly\u2026 hygienic.\u201d She glances around, at the cobwebbed walls and dirty floors, the piles of mouse droppings and the human bodies scattered at unnatural angles. \u201cInfection could still kill him.\u201d </p>\n<p>Geralt nods. \u201cDo you have medical supplies at your house?\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cI do,\u201d Yennefer says. \u201cWe\u2019ll take him there.\u201d </p>\n<p>If a bloody Witcher, an exhausted sorceress, and an unconscious bard are an unusual sight to the citizens of Novigrad, none of them really show it. They\u2019re mercifully unmolested on their way through the city, and before long they\u2019re laying Jaskier out on Yennefer\u2019s kitchen table, Geralt sliding a pillow from the sofa under his head and Yennefer pulling open his bloody clothes to allow herself better access to his wounds. </p>\n<p>Which is when she sees it.</p>\n<p>Jaskier\u2019s torso is a mess of scars, old and new, stabs and slashes, burns and bruises. They\u2019re crisscrossed over each other like a sewing pattern, interacting like ley lines, and Yennefer reaches out, traces her fingertips over a long, pink scar stretching across his right hip, clearly only a month or so old. </p>\n<p>\u201cYen?\u201d Geralt asks, frowning at her. </p>\n<p>Yennefer\u2019s mouth is dry. \u201cWhat the fuck happened to him?\u201d</p>\n<p>Geralt frowns. \u201cHe was kidnapped,\u201d he says. \u201cWe rescued him.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, Geralt, I know what happened <i>today</i>,\u201d Yennefer snaps. \u201cI\u2019m asking what happened to make your fucking <i>bard </i>carry more scars than some soldiers do? Gods, he looks like he\u2019s been torn apart.\u201d </p>\n<p>Geralt\u2019s jaw is tight. \u201cPeople have learnt that he\u2019s my friend,\u201d he says. \u201cSo they try to take him from me. And he doesn\u2019t keep his mouth shut when he should, so they hurt him, more often than not.\u201d </p>\n<p>Yennefer just stares at him, astonished. </p>\n<p>On the table, Jaskier stirs. \u201cGeralt?\u201d he says, sluggish and limp. </p>\n<p>Geralt is at his side in a moment, pressing a hand gently into his uninjured shoulder. \u201cYou\u2019re safe,\u201d he says, brushing sweat-slicked hair back from Jaskier\u2019s face. \u201cThey\u2019re dead.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jaskier groans, hands fluttering away from the table until Geralt carefully presses them down. \u201cMy shoulder,\u201d he rasps. </p>\n<p>\u201cYou were stabbed several times,\u201d Yennefer says, collecting herself enough to fetch a bowl of water and an antiseptic salve. \u201cI need to clean the wounds. It\u2019ll hurt.\u201d </p>\n<p>Jaskier\u2019s forehead scrunches almost drunkenly. \u201cI know,\u201d he sighs, his head rolling towards Geralt\u2019s hand. \u201cThis isn\u2019t my first time.\u201d </p>\n<p>Yennefer grits her teeth. \u201cHold him still, Geralt,\u201d she instructs, and gets to work. </p>\n<p>Jaskier bears the pain surprisingly well \u2013 or, well, not so surprising when Yennefer looks at the tapestry of scars worked across his skin. He breathes steadily, evenly, nostrils flaring as Yennefer packs his wounds with healing herbs and wraps them in clean bandages, and Geralt never leaves his side, hands pressed against Jaskier\u2019s skin, half restraint, half comfort. Yennefer watches them as she works, the protectiveness in Geralt\u2019s hands, the trust in Jaskier\u2019s laxity, and all of a sudden, it dawns on her. They don\u2019t know. They haven\u2019t realised, despite everything. They haven\u2019t worked it out. </p>\n<p>Yennefer washes her hands when she\u2019s done, scraping the blood and medicines out from under her nails, then puts away the rest of her supplies and goes back to the idiots in her kitchen. They\u2019re talking quietly, Geralt\u2019s hands hovering above Jaskier\u2019s unhurt shoulder, Jaskier\u2019s gaze following him like a flower following the sun, and Yennefer goes to them, folds her arms and eyes them both. \u201cYou do know,\u201d she says flatly, and the two of them snap to face her immediately, \u201cthat you\u2019re both hopelessly in love with each other?\u201d </p>\n<p>Jaskier flushes bright red, and Geralt just stares at her like a startled deer. </p>\n<p>Yennefer does not have time for their shit right now. \u201cI\u2019m going out,\u201d she says shortly. \u201cI\u2019ll be back in the morning. I expect you to have actually <i>talked</i> about your fucking feelings by then, because I\u2019ve seen the pair of you dancing around each other like idiots all across the Continent for too many years now. I\u2019m sick of it. You love each other. Work it out.\u201d </p>\n<p>And she turns on her heel, and leaves them to it. </p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<i>and one more. </i>\n</p>\n<p>After the war, after all the pain and heartbreak, Yennefer meets Geralt and Jaskier in a field of sunflowers just outside of Oxenfurt. They\u2019re sitting on a picnic blanket, of all things, with a wicker hamper full of wine and cheese sitting between them \u2013 and Yennefer joins them with a sigh, accepts a glass of red, and settles in to enjoy the late summer sun. </p>\n<p>They talk about inconsequential things, about the price of salmon, the height of the university\u2019s astronomical observatory, the politics of cartography, and then they talk about their lives. Jaskier has been offered a professorship, and he\u2019s going to take it. Geralt is going to take a break from witchering for a little while, maybe train some more with Ciri, maybe just rest. And Yennefer is going back to Vengerberg. </p>\n<p>Jaskier flashes her a knowing smile. \u201cThe wandering witch who always goes home in the end,\u201d he says, and tops up her glass. </p>\n<p>They talk some more, and drink some more, and remember. The sun moves through the sky, slow and lazy, and the crickets buzz in the fields around them, the swallows chirp overhead, the wagons travel along the rutted path just out of sight. It\u2019s a bucolic caricature and Yennefer doesn\u2019t think she\u2019s felt this peaceful in years. </p>\n<p>Jaskier falls asleep, a little before dusk, his cheeks flushed with wine and exhaustion. His head rests in Geralt\u2019s lap, one long-fingered hand curled loosely around Geralt\u2019s ankle, and Yennefer watches Geralt run his fingertips slowly through dark hair that\u2019s just beginning to be touched with silver. \u201cHe\u2019ll suit teaching,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd his students will love him.\u201d </p>\n<p>Geralt hums his agreement. </p>\n<p>Yennefer studies him. \u201cWill you stay with him?\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cFor a time,\u201d Geralt answers, after a moment. \u201cI don\u2019t know how long.\u201d His fingers still on the greying streaks at Jaskier\u2019s temples. \u201cBut he can\u2019t travel with me, anymore,\u201d he says, regret twisting his voice. \u201cHe\u2019s older than he once was.\u201d </p>\n<p>Yennefer smiles, just a little. \u201cHe ages slower than most humans,\u201d she says wryly. \u201cThe same at forty as at thirty. Excepting a few more dozen scars, of course.\u201d Geralt has the good grace to look vaguely guilty. \u201cI half-wondered if he might have elven blood in his family tree,\u201d Yennefer says. \u201cOr a dash of fae. Enough to give him a little immortality.\u201d </p>\n<p>Geralt\u2019s lips curl in a soft smile. \u201cHe\u2019s all human,\u201d he says, then snorts. \u201cAsk him about his skincare regime sometime. He swears by it.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cPity,\u201d Yennefer says, softer. \u201cI\u2019ve grown to appreciate his company.\u201d She\u2019s silent for a moment. \u201cI have to say, though, I think the grey suits him.\u201d </p>\n<p>Geralt hums. \u201cSo do I.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cWill you stay with him?\u201d Yennefer asks again, and they both know that she\u2019s asking a different question, now, a harder question. </p>\n<p>Geralt holds Jaskier\u2019s sleeping body with a tenderness that Yennefer never thought she would see at the hands of a Witcher. \u201cUntil the end,\u201d he answers eventually, his thumb skimming across the shell of Jaskier\u2019s ear, and the warm light of the sun catches in his pale hair. </p>\n<p>Yennefer sips her wine, closes her eyes, and listens to the birdsong, to the the rustle of the sunflowers, to the slow, steady whisper of Jaskier\u2019s sleeping breaths.</p>"
