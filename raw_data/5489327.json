  "summary": "<p>Tony knows what the team really thinks of him. It's a delicate balance: they tolerate him because of his money and his toys, and he gets to stay on the team and fight with them. He's okay with that. So long as he hides the fact that Steve's and Bucky's names are written on his skin in the most embarrassing act of one-sided <strike>love</strike> affection ever, everything will be fine.</p>\n<p>It just figures that a fantastically stupid villain, a kidnapping plot and a video camera will bring Tony's well-kept secret out into the open.</p>",

  "text": "<p>At one point in Tony's life, waking up blindfolded, tied to a chair, and stripped to his boxers would've meant fun, sexy things were about to happen. He's not that lucky now. He has just long enough to ascertain two more facts, that he's tied down with rope and his head is throbbing worse than it did the first time he got seriously drunk when he was thirteen, before fingers slide into his hair and cruelly wrench his head up. He yelps at the pain that shoots down his neck, arching his back to try and take some of the pressure off.</p>\n<p>\"Now, now, Mr. Stark. None of that.\" The voice is unfamiliar, but that doesn't mean much: there's tons of way to modify a voice. The grip on his hair tightens, pulling until his neck is aching just as bad as his head and Tony is stretched as far as he can go to alleviate the pain. Just when he thinks that his hair is going to come right off, the hand suddenly lets go. He slumps down in the chair, breathing hard, and the man laughs at him.</p>\n<p>\"So much for the great Iron Man, the amazing Tony Stark. You were pathetically easy to kidnap. Do you always pay such little attention to your surroundings, or is your security team really that anxious to get rid of you?\"</p>\n<p>\"Fuck you,\" Tony slurs, closing his eyes. It doesn't make much difference because of the blindfold, but instinct has his eyes straining to focus in a way that's making him dizzy. \"I'm not sure what you hope to gain from kidnapping me. Stark Industries won't pay whatever ransom you're planning to ask for, so you're out of luck.\"</p>\n<p>\"Maybe they won't, but the Avengers will.\"</p>\n<p>It takes a worrying second for the words to process, but once they do Tony actually laughs. His head <i>pounds</i>, bands of pain wrapping around his temples, but he still spits out, \"Oh my god, are you kidding me? <i>That's</i> why you kidnapped me? To get to the team? Sorry, you're barking up the wrong tree. I would say try again, except you'd probably - no, you know what, please do try again. Next time aim for the gorgeous redhead with the green eyes and the collection of knives up her sleeve. I'd love to see what happens when you -\"</p>\n<p>The man slaps him hard. Tony's head snaps to the side and his ears ring. Over the ringing, the man snaps, \"Don't try to lie to me, Stark. I know what this means.\" He jabs Tony twice with the tip of a knife, once just over his heart and the other on his right shoulder blade. \"You expect me to believe that Captain America and the Winter Soldier won't pay to get their soulmate back?\"</p>\n<p>The words make something in Tony's chest go cold. All amusement drains away, and he says flatly, \"That doesn't mean anything. Never has, never will.\"</p>\n<p>And there's too much to go into, not that he'd share his story of woe with this psychopath anyway. There's no point in explaining that Tony's been in love with Steve since he could walk, that Steve's name had formed on his heart when he was only eight years old and hasn't faded no matter how much he claimed to hate Captain America in the following years. Or that Bucky's name appeared, burning and sharp, on his back a scant year after Steve brought Bucky home to the tower and Tony made him smile for the first time.</p>\n<p>Or that Steve Rogers and Bucky Barnes have been in love for over a hundred years, and they're each other's soulmate. It's the kind of fabled love story that makes women and men alike swoon, because those two soldiers triumphed over everything to get back to each other. And that leaves Tony out in the cold, the idiot who went and fell in love with them both, the outsider who will never get what he wants the most.</p>\n<p>\"I just warned you not to lie to me.\" Another slap to the other side of his face, and Tony's beginning to wonder if this is going to leave him with whiplash. \"The Avengers will pay to get their beloved teammate back.\"</p>\n<p>\"Yeah,\" Tony says. \"They would, if you'd taken one of their beloved teammates. Instead, you got me. Newsflash. I'm the perpetual fuck-up of the group. I don't listen to orders. I'm not a team player. No one trusts me to have their backs. I'm just the guy who makes everyone look pretty and pays for all the damage we do. That's the only reason they keep me around, and guess what? My will means they all get lots of money, more than enough to keep them in upgrades and damages for years. Granted, their upgrades won\u2019t be awesome, but against idiots like you my genius is clearly wasted.\u201d He manages a smirk. \u201cSo this time you're the one who fucked up.\"</p>\n<p>\"You are Iron Man,\" the guy says, but he's sounding less convinced now.</p>\n<p>\u201cEver heard of the Iron Patriot? They\u2019ll love Rhodey, trust me. He\u2019s all about following orders. He likes to think he stole a suit, but I had to give him a reason to keep coming around. I keep it up to date on purpose. And it\u2019s not like Pepper will abandon the team. If she can put up with me for as long as she has, she can help them. It\u2019ll be much easier for her to earn her paycheck that way\u2026 no pay is enough to put up with me.\u201d His words are slowing down. It\u2019s getting harder to think. He\u2019s not even sure if his eyes are opened or closed now.</p>\n<p>He passes out to the sound of fierce whispering, and the sense of triumph that at least he\u2019s inspiring dissent amongst his kidnappers follows him into his nightmares. </p>\n<p>Another slap jolts him awake. His head lolls back on his neck with the force of it, body feeling curiously heavy, like everything is too much effort. They grab him by the hair again and wrench his head up, tearing the blindfold off. The light is staggering in how much it hurts, slicing into his eyes. If he could, he\u2019d shield his eyes. As it is, he twitches pathetically and tries to turn his head away. They don\u2019t let him, forcing him to stare into the light until he can make out the shape of a man.</p>\n<p>\u201cSee this, Stark?\u201d the man says. It\u2019s a different guy than before, but he\u2019s got a knife. \u201cSince you say that your soulmates don\u2019t care about you, perhaps I should do them a favor and cut their names off of you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Tony\u2019s first instinct, which he clamps down on, is to beg. Even if Steve and Bucky will never think of him like that, he\u2019s taken solace in knowing that somehow, in some miniscule way, he\u2019s a match for them. Those names and the fantasy they represent have gotten him through some dark days. But he doesn\u2019t deserve them. He knows that deep down, and if he were a better man he\u2019d have taken a knife and carved Steve Rogers and Bucky Barnes out of his flesh himself. </p>\n<p>\u201cGo ahead,\u201d Tony says hoarsely. His mouth aches. Has he been screaming? He can\u2019t remember. \u201cYou\u2019re right. You\u2019d be doing them a favor.\u201d</p>\n<p>The guy looks at him, eyes squinted through his mask, and it\u2019s so clearly not the answer he wanted that Tony can\u2019t help smiling. That definitely provokes a response; he gets stabbed in the chest, just below his armpit and to the side of where Steve\u2019s name is written. The knife sinks easily into his skin and he jerks, gurgling on a scream. It\u2019s agonizing, and yet all Tony can think is how ridiculously glad he is that they didn\u2019t slice Steve\u2019s name off after all.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re pathetic. How did you earn the name of an Avenger?\u201d someone behind him says.</p>\n<p>\u201cSheer luck. They didn\u2019t want me until Loki attacked and they didn\u2019t have a choice, and now I\u2019m pretty sure that they\u2019re just afraid I\u2019ll take all my toys back and dump the team on the street if they kick me out.\u201d The words tumble out, because what difference does it really make? Maybe he should shut up, go along with it, pretend the team is coming. But they\u2019re not, they\u2019re not and Tony <i>knows</i> that, and it would be way too easy to convince himself that they are. It will hurt too much when they don\u2019t. </p>\n<p>The knife gets pulled out roughly and the guy stomps past Tony. The hand lets go of his hair and Tony\u2019s head falls forward instantly. He can feel blood trickling down his side, warm and distracting. He\u2019s never been kidnapped as leverage against the team before: leverage hasn\u2019t been the reason since he was a teenager and Howard made the decision that Maria was no longer allowed to pay ransoms for him. Usually they want him to build things. But maybe these idiots are a shade smarter if they\u2019re not willing to give him access to even scrap metal.</p>\n<p>He might pass out for a little while. It\u2019s hard to tell when his thoughts are slow as syrup and processing what\u2019s happening around him takes way more effort that he can expend right now. But he definitely wakes up when he gets stabbed again, this time on his back just to the side of Bucky\u2019s name, so deep he thinks he feels the tip of the knife impact the arc reactor. He whimpers when they leave it there, sticking out of him, and his ears fill with a dull roar. </p>\n<p>Or maybe not so dull, and it's not just him. They\u2019re panicking, people scrambling around and yelling, and Tony doesn\u2019t understand why until the door to the room is literally wrenched off its hinges. A familiar circular object whips into the room, slamming into the faces of one-two-three-four-five guys before it's caught. Tony blinks slowly as Captain America stalks into the room, face set with murderous intent. The Winter Solider is right behind him, and yeah that <i>is</i> the Winter Soldier, eyes cold and intent in a way Tony hasn\u2019t seen for a long time.</p>\n<p>\u201cShoot them, you bastards, shoot them!\u201d one of the guys is screaming. Poetically, he promptly gets shot in the chest. Tony stares at the body, barely hearing as Bucky shoots the other two men, and in the wake of all that silence the absence of screaming is startling.</p>\n<p>The only sound in the room is Steve breathing hard, like he\u2019s been running for \u2013 well, not miles, because Tony knows he can run further than that without breaking a sweat, but for a really long time. He wrenches his cowl back, and his eyes look even bluer for his pink cheeks, and Tony feels a familiar spasm of longing somewhere deep inside his belly. Right up until Bucky stalks back around to the front of him, and he realizes that both of them still look really, <i>really</i> pissed off. The haze of pain is quickly splintered by cold fear.</p>\n<p>Because now they know. Two years of never removing his shirt around Steve, plus an extra two years of being hyper vigilant once Bucky moved in, means that it\u2019s been a very long time since Tony was naked in front of anyone. He hadn\u2019t trusted the make-up that carried him through his teens and twenties and obscures Steve\u2019s name on all the videos. But they can see it all. See the name on his chest and the name on his back, and they <i>know</i>, and they look <i>so mad</i>.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Tony slurs, and it\u2019s kind of hard to make his mouth form words right now, but he thinks this needs to be said before one or both of them try to kill him. He really doesn\u2019t want to die here. \u201cSorry, I \u2013 I didn\u2019t mean to, sorry.\u201d</p>\n<p>Bucky grabs Steve\u2019s arm, stopping Steve\u2019s progress. His eyes are still dark. \u201cSorry for what?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYour names. Didn\u2019t mean to. I just, Steve\u2019s been there since I was a kid, and Bucky\u2019s just happened, and I tried to stop. I know I\u2019m not \u2013 I tried to \u2013 you\u2019re so much - sorry.\u201d He cuts himself off because now they look even madder, and he already hurts so much, and he can\u2019t stop the pathetic whimper from rolling out. \u201cPlease, don\u2019t hurt me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThey\u2019re not going to hurt you.\u201d Coulson strides into the room, shouldering Bucky and Steve aside with ease, and his mouth tightens when he looks at Tony for the first time. \u201cCan I cut you free, Stark?\u201d</p>\n<p>It\u2019s a weird question to ask. Tony thinks he nods. He gets why Coulson asked when the agent takes a switchblade out of his pocket, and he can\u2019t help flinching. He forgets about the other two, too focused on watching Coulson slip the blade under the rope and slice through it easily. It\u2019s a complicated set of knots, requiring more than one cut, and Coulson swears when he gets around to Tony\u2019s back and he sees the knife still sticking out of his shoulder. Tony cocks his head.</p>\n<p>\u201cY\u2019don\u2019t swear,\u201d he mumbles.</p>\n<p>\u201cAs always, you push me to new heights,\u201d Coulson says, and he looks a little like Steve and Bucky did, angry, but that\u2019s commonplace for Coulson and anyway he\u2019s doing a much better job of controlling it. He strips off his jacket and gently drapes it around Tony\u2019s shoulders, mindful of the knife, and only then does Tony realize he\u2019s trembling. </p>\n<p>\u201cAgent?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMy shoulder hurts.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI know. I have paramedics on the way.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSteve\u2019n\u2019Bucky\u2019re mad at me,\u201d Tony adds, struggling to focus on his face. \u201cThey hate me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Coulson sighs and looks up over Tony\u2019s head. For some reason, he\u2019s got a glare on his face. Tony\u2019s too tired to see what he\u2019s glaring at as Coulson says gently, \u201cBelieve me, Tony, you are so wrong about that, you don\u2019t even know.\u201d</p>\n<p>Tony would like to explain how very not wrong he is \u2013 he\u2019s got data to back it all up; it\u2019s all been categorized into lists, hidden away in the depths of his servers, that he looks over whenever he starts dreaming too seriously about a life with his soulmates \u2013 but his tongue isn\u2019t cooperating anymore and his head is getting really heavy. He\u2019s not conscious of closing his eyes. He\u2019s not really conscious of anything anymore.</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>Tony disappears on a Wednesday morning. No one knows for six hours after the fact, and, by the time word gets passed to the Avengers, the kidnappers and Tony are long gone. It\u2019s a tense three days before they get any sign that Tony is even alive, and it comes through video footage that is so heavily encrypted that it takes JARVIS four long hours to work out how to even get it to play. Once it does, Bucky almost wishes that they hadn\u2019t. </p>\n<p>The footage \u2013 recorded, JARVIS says, not live, though that\u2019s hardly a comfort once they\u2019ve watched it \u2013 is horrifying. It\u2019s bad enough to have to stand by and watch Tony be beaten. But the things he says, the words that come out of his mouth\u2026 it\u2019s apparent to anyone who spends more than five minutes with Tony that he has a very poor opinion of himself. Bucky didn\u2019t know it was like this. No one did. Pepper cries, tears sliding silently down her cheeks, and looks more shaken than Bucky\u2019s ever seen her as she walks out to call Rhodey.</p>\n<p>In the ensuing silence, the video switches to live. Rage is an emotion that Bucky is familiar with, but it\u2019s never been this potent before as he watches the knife scrape across Steve\u2019s name, across <i>his</i> name, and sees the resignation on Tony\u2019s face. It hurt somewhere deep inside, in a place that Bucky had been convinced that Hydra destroyed. That hopelessness wasn\u2019t put there by the kidnappers, no. That\u2019s the fault of the team and in particular Steve and Bucky, who have failed Tony Stark so completely they didn\u2019t even know it was happening until the evidence was shoved in their faces.</p>\n<p>When the video cuts out, Bucky clears his throat and says the only thing he can think of. \u201cSteve, I think we\u2019re going to have to be a lot less subtle in the future.\u201d</p>\n<p>Steve just puts his fist through the wall and snarls, \u201cJARVIS, you better be able to trace that footage. We\u2019re going to get Tony. Now.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTracing now, Captain Rogers,\u201d JARVIS answers, and he adds something else, something about how the kidnappers made a mistake when they switched over from recorded footage to providing live video, but no one is listening. They spill out of the cramped room and swarm the quinjet. Clint practically throws himself into the pilot seat beside Coulson and starts the jet with quick, jerky movements.</p>\n<p>The tension in the jet, especially when they find out that Tony is being held only three hours away, is palpable. Steve is twitching, so filled with fury that he can\u2019t stand still. He\u2019s always been like this, even when he was a punk kid who weighed 90lbs soaking wet. Anger gives him energy, makes him explosive, and heaven help anyone who gets in his way. Anger gives Bucky energy, too, but his years as the Winter Soldier have taught him how to channel that into stillness. People, he\u2019s discovered, get so much more afraid when you\u2019re quiet.</p>\n<p>He can feel it flowing over him by the way his muscles loosen and his breath comes slower, not panicked. Natasha meets his gaze and he sees the change in her, the Black Widow staring back at the Winter Soldier, both of them united in an unspoken agreement to end the life of anyone who participated in this kidnapping. He sets a hand on the handle of his favorite gun and stands in stoic silence for the whole trip, until Clint lands the quinjet in a small clearing a mile out.</p>\n<p>\u201cBruce, we need the Hulk,\u201d Steve says, just barely polite, and Bruce nods. His skin has held a tint of green for the past four and a half days, and he looks glad to be putting it to use finally. He strips off except for the customized pants Tony made him and makes his way out of the jet. Less than a minute later, the Hulk and Thor are raining fury down on the compound. Natasha and Clint disappear into the trees to pick off the idiots stupid enough to think they can run. </p>\n<p>Coulson follows them into the compound, officially to keep an eye on what\u2019s going on. Unofficially, Bucky thinks, it\u2019s to see firsthand whether Tony is okay, though Coulson would probably cut his own tongue out before admitting he cares about Tony in any way. That\u2019s the problem, though. Maybe there\u2019s been a little too much of that going around. And while Tony\u2019s never been good at picking up on subtlety, Bucky\u2019s pretty sure the fault for this lies entirely on them. </p>\n<p>They find their missing teammate without too much difficulty. Steve\u2019s shield takes care of over half the room in one fell swoop, and Bucky gleefully guns down the rest. Talking to Tony isn\u2019t so easy. Bucky\u2019s heart drops straight through his stomach when he sees the fear in Tony\u2019s face, and some of that is from the drugs and concussion, but too much of it is purely Tony. He\u2019s relieved when Coulson intervenes, having been waiting right outside the door, and shoulders them aside with ease to cut Tony free. </p>\n<p>The paramedics walk in and swarm Tony, and Bucky turns to Steve. He recognizes the look on Steve\u2019s face; he\u2019s shutting down, internalizing the blame, and they don\u2019t have time for that bullshit right now. So his punch to Steve\u2019s arm is less than gentle, but it\u2019s not even close to what they both deserve. In almost any other setting, the offended expression Steve shoots him would be amusing.</p>\n<p>\u201cKnock it off,\u201d Bucky says, low but firm. \u201cWe have to focus on fixing this, Steve. Instead of stewing in guilt, put that strategist brain of yours to work figuring out how we\u2019re going to make Tony realize that we\u2019ve wanted this for a long time.\u201d</p>\n<p>Because they have. Steve was first, of course: it took him all of three days after he and Bucky kissed for the first time this side of the millennium to confess that he had feelings for Tony. He\u2019s never tried to hide Tony\u2019s name, which is written on the underside of his right arm in a surprisingly delicate scrawl. Bucky didn\u2019t understand it at first. He was jealous, though he tried not to show it. There were people that had more than one soulmate even when they were kids, and it was happening more now.</p>\n<p>But then, the more time he spent with Tony Stark\u2026 oh yeah, he got it. The guy was a little shit at times, cocky and arrogant and constantly snarky, but simultaneously generous, kind, and possessing a talent for making really old super soldiers feel at ease. He\u2019d rebuilt Bucky\u2019s arm from the gears up and never once flinched away from a bad moment on Bucky\u2019s part \u2013 which were rare, after a while, but more frequent in the beginning. It took all of six months for his name to appear on Bucky\u2019s left inner thigh. </p>\n<p>Steve, when he saw Tony\u2019s name on Bucky\u2019s flesh for the first time, just smiled.</p>\n<p>Now, Steve\u2019s mouth is twisted into a grimace. \u201cHow did we fuck up so bad, Buck?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe were trying to be careful. We weren\u2019t sure\u2026\u201d Bucky trails off, because in the glaring light of day it suddenly seems so obvious. Of <i>course</i> Tony wanted them back. The signs have been there for months; they just weren\u2019t paying attention. And he wouldn\u2019t have said anything, because apparently he\u2019s gotten the impression that they hate him. That the whole team hates him, or at very least just puts up with him because they have to for money and upgrades. </p>\n<p>His head aches as he looks back at Tony, who is being very carefully loaded onto a stretcher on his side. \u201cYou\u2019re right. We fucked up. There\u2019s no excuses for that. We should\u2019ve said something before it got this far, soulmates or not. But we can start fixing this by being there when he wakes up.\u201d</p>\n<p>Tony is transported to the SHIELD Medical Bay, where he spends five hours in surgery having the knife from his back removed and the internal damage from both stab wounds fixed. In addition to that, he also has a broken right ankle, three broken ribs and four cracked ribs, sprained fingers, a fractured radius on his left arm, numerous bruises and scrapes, and a bad concussion. It\u2019s not as bad as it could have been \u2013 not as bad as some missions have been \u2013 but, in light of <i>how</i> it happened, it's not good.</p>\n<p>They gather in his room after the doctor finishes a complicated explanation that only Bruce understands. Steve sits down on Tony\u2019s right side with a proprietary, determined air and takes Tony\u2019s hand into his own. Bucky glances at Pepper, half-expecting her to take Tony\u2019s other hand, but Pepper just shakes her head wearily. He sits, taking Tony\u2019s hand more carefully, mindful of the bandages and the I.V. that\u2019s pumping sedatives and pain medication into Tony.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s been a very long five days, and predictably no one takes it well when Natasha says, \u201cWhen he wakes up, I may kill him.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t even joke about that right now,\u201d Clint says. He\u2019s got an arm draped around her shoulders and looks as tired as Bucky feels. \u201cHe might hear you and think you mean it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI <i>do</i> mean it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, you don\u2019t,\u201d Bruce says, giving her a small but fond smile. \u201cTony will be fine. He\u2019ll have to be on bed rest for a while, though. From what I\u2019m seeing here, he\u2019s been running himself into the ground. Exhaustion and lack of food will do a lot more damage than anything else.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMan cannot live on coffee alone,\u201d Clint mutters.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll clear his schedule for the next three weeks,\u201d says Pepper. Her eyes are still damp, but she\u2019s otherwise composed. \u201cI\u2019ll talk to Director Fury and make sure that he knows any work Tony\u2019s been doing for SHIELD is on hold as of right now. And he just finished the schematics for a new Starkpad, so that will hold the board off. How long until he wakes up, Bruce?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSometime tomorrow, but it might be two or three days before he\u2019s aware enough to talk.\u201d</p>\n<p>Pepper nods, her jaw set in a familiar, stubborn way. \u201cThat\u2019s okay. We can wait. Rhodey\u2019s not coming in until later tonight anyway.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe can\u2019t bombard him all at once. That could actually have the opposite effect, \u201d Bruce cautions.</p>\n<p>\u201cOr it may make him understand that we desire him as a shield brother,\u201d says Thor. He\u2019s making an effort to be quiet, which really just means he\u2019s talking at a volume that would be considered loud for anyone else. \u201cOn Asgard, we are more open with our affection.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t think an orgy is going to help,\u201d Clint says. Bucky tenses at the thought. He can just make out the curve of the \u2018S\u2019 to Steve\u2019s name under the hem of Tony\u2019s hospital gown. He and Steve haven\u2019t discussed it, but he is 100% certain that the realization that Tony is their soulmate has only made them want him more. Tony is <i>theirs</i>.</p>\n<p>Thor looks entirely too amused. \u201cA splendid idea, but one I believe my fair Jane would take issue with. I simply meant that there are times when a positive word or invitation can make all the difference in the world. I know I have often wished that I had made more of an effort to include Loki when we were children. I wonder if it might have made more of a difference if I had.\u201d</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a heavy silence, and Bucky doesn\u2019t know about everyone else but he\u2019s imagining Tony as Loki. He\u2019s only had a couple of encounters with Thor\u2019s brother, but that was more than enough to know he doesn\u2019t want more. And it could go that way easily; Tony has ample money to become a super villain, or even just a villain, not to mention the intelligence, and right now he doesn\u2019t feel a connection to anyone on the team. The whole world would be in a lot of trouble if it came to that. They\u2019d be fucked if Tony and Loki ever decided to pair up.</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay, well, that\u2019s the creepiest thing I\u2019ve heard all day,\u201d Clint says. </p>\n<p>\u201cIt was not meant to disturb you,\u201d Thor says apologetically. \u201cI merely meant to -\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s hard.\u201d Bucky\u2019s mouth moves of its own accord, is letting out words. Usually he doesn\u2019t speak a whole lot around the team, preferring one-on-one interaction to the whole group, but the words keep coming. \u201cWhen you \u2013 you don\u2019t look at the world properly, or the people around you, and nothing processes the way other people think it should. I remember Howard Stark. This is \u2013 he wasn\u2019t \u2013\u201d He can\u2019t say it out the way he wants to. But it\u2019s true. He remembers tailing Howard Stark a few days before arranging the car accident. He remembers that little boy and the cold way Howard talked to him, how nothing was ever good enough. </p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d Natasha says, and Bucky shakes his head.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s not. This is all Tony\u2019s ever known,\u201d he says, like an offering, and it\u2019s not right, but he thinks the meaning might be getting across anyway. \u201cPeople want \u2013 they want money, or \u2013 or something. It\u2019s never just about him.\u201d Just like it was never about Bucky, but the Winter Soldier. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t know that you\u2019re any different. It\u2019s easier to accept a concrete reason based on past evidence, instead of thinking\u2026 maybe it\u2019s about you this time.\u201d</p>\n<p>No one says anything for the longest time. They\u2019re all staring at Tony, even Steve. Tony, who is so good at hiding behind words. He and Bucky are the same in some ways, but Bucky\u2019s never relearned the art of words. He forgot them after all his years as the Winter Soldier, because Hydra didn\u2019t want to hear anything but \u2018yes\u2019. But he\u2019s familiar with how hard it is to trust people. It took him days to believe that Steve didn\u2019t have an ulterior motive, weeks to believe that Tony just wanted to help, months to believe that Natasha had fully defected, and even longer to trust anyone else. </p>\n<p>Coulson breaks the silence, slipping into the room and setting a hand on Pepper\u2019s arm. \u201cI\u2019ve set up a schedule,\u201d he says. \u201cSo that Tony won\u2019t be alone when he wakes up. I don\u2019t care if you stay and hang out when it\u2019s not your time, but at some point all of you will be going home to sleep.\u201d He levels a pointed look at Steve and Bucky. \u201cTony will only feel guilty if he finds you all looking like wrecks.\u201d</p>\n<p>Murmurs rise through the room, and Coulson holds up a hand. \u201cThe schedule starts tomorrow morning. For now, I\u2019ve ordered in food. It\u2019ll be here in twenty minutes.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThanks Phil,\u201d Steve says with a tired smile. He meets Bucky\u2019s gaze briefly, and Bucky can tell what he\u2019s thinking: it\u2019s not too late. When Tony wakes up, they\u2019ll talk to him. And if this is something he wants, if the three of them are something he wants, then they\u2019ll make it happen. Bucky\u2019s had a hard time learning to trust people, but he thinks that for Tony, he can learn how to use words again.</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>Natasha is upset. It\u2019s not written across her face, but Steve can see the tension in her subdued grace. He hates to leave Tony, but with Phil, Pepper and Natasha all ganging up on him, he gives in and leaves Bucky, Clint and Thor there. He accompanies Natasha and Bruce back to the tower, already knowing that he probably won\u2019t sleep. He\u2019s gotten used to sleeping beside Bucky, and he\u2019s wanted to sleep beside Tony for years. Sleeping by himself isn\u2019t going to go over well.</p>\n<p>So he\u2019s surprised when, after a long shower, he emerges from the bathroom to find Natasha curled up in his bed, waiting for him. Even before he gets to the bed, she says, \u201cThis is my fault. The report I wrote back when I first met Tony\u2026 I never told him otherwise. He still thinks that SHIELD and the team only want Iron Man, that we have no interest in Tony Stark. I should have said something. I thought he\u2019d figure it out.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFor a genius, he\u2019s not very smart sometimes,\u201d Steve agrees, but fondly. He admires that about Tony, actually. For someone who is extremely intelligent, and who has every reason to see bad things in the world, Tony can still see the good. He\u2019s always trying to make things better. Steve just wishes that Tony could see there\u2019s good in him too.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s just it. After all this time, he still doesn\u2019t know? We\u2019ve been living here for four years,\u201d she says, sounding aggravated. \u201cDoes he really believe we\u2019d stick around that long just for the free rent and upgrades?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. Probably. It\u2019s not your fault. You didn\u2019t realize. None of us did. I thought the team was going pretty well, actually,\u201d he confides, sitting down on the bed. \u201cAll of us were getting along for the most part... Our success rate on the field is better than ever. We weren\u2019t fighting. We had team night once a week. Sure, I usually had to drag Tony and Bruce out of their labs, but\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not your fault if it\u2019s not mine,\u201d Natasha points out. \u201cTony\u2019s a fantastic actor. He fooled all of us. Of course he did. When you spend your whole life around people who only want to be nice to you for money, or your body, or your tech, you learn to take what you can get.\u201d She sighs, shutting her eyes. \u201cPepper\u2019s so upset. She\u2019s really hurt that Tony thinks she\u2019s sticking around just for the paycheck.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI bet Rhodey is furious, too.\u201d</p>\n<p>Natasha nods without opening her eyes. \u201cI think so. Everyone is. At themselves mostly, I think. I know that I am. I should\u2019ve seen this coming, Steve.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ve all been busy,\u201d Steve says quietly, not that that\u2019s an excuse \u2013 and they both know it. He\u2019s spent so much time with Bucky over the past couple years. Especially at first, Bucky sucked up all of his and Natasha\u2019s time. Even though he was still participating in missions, he lost touch with everyone else for a little while. Seeing Tony again, really <i>seeing</i> him the first night Bucky was comfortable enough to visit the tower, felt like coming home. He wonders now if Tony knows that. He never bothered to say as much. He wishes he had now.</p>\n<p>Tony took their raggedy group in and gave everyone a home. He lifts his head, looking up at the familiar ceiling. Soulmate or not, Steve wants him. All of the reasons he and Bucky had for not approaching Tony before \u2013 they weren\u2019t sure he was really over Pepper, they didn\u2019t know if he\u2019d be open to a relationship with three people, and what if he just wasn\u2019t interested in them? \u2013 suddenly seem stupid. Steve\u2019s supposed to be the brave one here, and he\u2019s let cowardice keep him quiet and separate Tony from the team.</p>\n<p>He lets Natasha pull him down into the bed. They don\u2019t say anything else. JARVIS turns the lights down, and Steve tries to sleep. He\u2019s not really successful. He doesn\u2019t have nightmares, surprisingly, but he thinks it\u2019s because he never sleeps long enough for that. Natasha doesn\u2019t sleep well either; every time he wakes up, she\u2019s already awake and looking up at the ceiling. The night drags by, and it feels like weeks have passed by the time the clock reads 6am and Steve is allowed back at Medical.</p>\n<p>The first time Tony wakes up, Bucky and Steve and Clint are in the room with him. Tony\u2019s fuzzy, Steve can tell right off, his brown eyes flicking around the room with confusion and a hint of fear. When he sees Bucky and Steve, though, he visibly relaxes. His face brightens up with an open, sleepy smile that twists Steve\u2019s stomach, and all he can do is sit there and squeeze Tony\u2019s hand tighter, wondering how he could have thought that Tony didn\u2019t want him. Them.</p>\n<p>But true to Bruce\u2019s word, it\u2019s three days before Tony really wakes up and has any degree of lucidity. Steve is there and so is Rhodey, both of them sitting in a contemplative silence. Tony comes to with a jolt, trying to sit up automatically, stopping halfway through with a pained grunt. Rhodey\u2019s on his feet immediately, pressing Tony back down against the bed. Steve quells every instinct that demands he help, sensing this is something that Rhodey needs to do.</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t, Tones,\u201d Rhodey says firmly. \u201cIt\u2019s okay. But you can\u2019t sit up. You\u2019ll hurt yourself.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cRhodey?\u201d Tony mumbles, his voice all raspy, and Steve wordlessly picks up the pitcher of warm water on the nightstand and pours him a glass. He holds the glass, angling the straw so that Tony can drink. Tony does, taking deep, grateful gulps until the glass is half empty.</p>\n<p>The door opens and Pepper pokes her head in, no doubt having heard Rhodey\u2019s voice. Her eyes get really big and glassy when she sees Tony, and Steve starts thinking that this is something he probably shouldn\u2019t be here for. Except he\u2019s still holding Tony\u2019s hand, and he doesn\u2019t really want to let go. Not unless Tony actively pulls away, and he hasn\u2019t, though possibly because he hasn\u2019t realized Steve\u2019s holding his hand yet.</p>\n<p>\u201cTony,\u201d Pepper whispers, as though afraid to speak more loudly, edging into the room and closing the door behind her. There\u2019s a cautiousness to her that is at odds with her normal, confident self. She meets Steve\u2019s gaze, and he raises his eyebrows in silent question. He\u2019ll go, if she really wants him to, but Pepper gives her head a single shake. </p>\n<p>\u201cHey, Pep,\u201d Tony says, sounding marginally better. \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh god, Tony, you scared me. Are you okay?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, you look fine,\u201d Rhodey says, blatantly giving him the once-over. \u201cYou look like crap, man, and I know they\u2019ve got you on strong painkillers, but you have to be feeling it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Tony shrugs and then winces a little. \u201cIt\u2019s not that bad. What happened?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you remember being kidnapped?\u201d Pepper asks.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd do you remember telling your kidnappers that the only reason we keep you around is for money and upgrades?\u201d Rhodey asks, and the words sound pleasant enough. Steve can pinpoint the exact moment when it sinks in, and Tony jolts. His hand squeezes Steve\u2019s hand, and for the first time he seems to realize Steve is there. The expression of confused surprise when he looks at Steve is heartbreaking.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2026\u201d Tony starts and then stops, eyes flicking from Rhodey to Pepper to Steve, seemingly sensing that he\u2019s treading on thin ice. \u201cNo?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re a shit liar in general, but that was just sad,\u201d Rhodey says, shaking his head. \u201cIs that really the only reason you let me keep the suit? And why you upgrade it? Because you think I\u2019ll stop being your friend if you don\u2019t?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cRhodey\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBecause that\u2019s not true and you damn well know it, Tony Stark. What about all those years in university? I didn\u2019t accept any money from you then.\u201d</p>\n<p>Tony hesitates for a moment. \u201cThe army\u2026 you were paid to watch me\u2026\u201d he says in a small voice. It kills Steve to see the uncertainty in his face, especially because he knows that if Tony weren't heavily medicated, all of his shields would be up in full force and he'd never be saying this. He prays that Pepper's and Rhodey's words are actually penetrating, and that Tony will remember them.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, and I didn\u2019t tell them shit that you didn't want them to know,\u201d Rhodey growls. \u201cMy loyalty has always been to you, you fucker. Me getting a job as the military liaison between Stark Industries and the army was a way for me to spend more time with you instead of being sent god knows where. I thought it was what you wanted. If I\u2019d known how you were taking it \u2013\u201d</p>\n<p>\"Not to mention,\" Pepper says, smoothly cutting Rhodey off, \"you seem to be under the impression that I'm only here because you sign my paycheck. I'll tell you one thing, you were right in that no amount of money would be enough to keep me here if I didn't want to be. Tony, I <i>love</i> you. I didn't break up with you because I stopped loving you. I told you, I can't handle it when you're out there fighting. And that's about me, not you.\"</p>\n<p>There's so much emotion in her voice that Steve has to force himself to sit still when all he really wants to do is squirm uncomfortably. None of the team was really sure what happened between Tony and Pepper, not even Bruce. Everything seemed okay one day, and then suddenly there was a week-long period where no one saw Tony and several weeks where Pepper didn't come by the tower. When he resurfaced Tony refused to talk about it, and whatever Natasha heard from Pepper remained in confidence. But Steve's always wondered, and now he knows. </p>\n<p>Tony remains silent, just staring at them, and Pepper sinks down onto the edge of the bed. She puts a hand on his knee and says, \"Listen to me. Stark Industries could go bust tomorrow and I'd still be here. I love my job, and I love our company, but we're friends before everything else. Sure there are days when you frustrate me, and days where you make my job a hundred times harder, and you have to buy me pretty things to make up for those days. But even if you didn't, I wouldn't just leave. I don't care how much money you have. I care about <i>you</i>.\"</p>\n<p>\"That goes for me too,\" says Rhodey, putting his hand on top of Pepper's. \"If you think I'm only here for the suit upgrades, then I'm officially cutting off your access.\"</p>\n<p>\"What?\" Tony says, blinking rapidly. \"But who will...?\"</p>\n<p>Rhodey shrugs. \"I'm sure there's someone at SHIELD who can keep my suit up to date. I'll find someone. I'd rather hand it over to someone else than have you think that's the only reason I hang around.\"</p>\n<p>\"No. No, don't do that,\" Tony says. He sounds a little distressed. If he were less medicated, he'd be ranting about the ineptitude of SHIELD. As it is, he sounds like he's going to cry. Steve can't help squeezing his hand in comfort as Tony whispers, \"I didn't want - I'm sorry. Please don't take the suit away.\"</p>\n<p>Rhodey visibly melts. \"I won't, but you have to realize we're friends, idiot,\" he says, his voice warm, cuffing Tony very gently on his un-bandaged shoulder. \"And just for the record, being an Avenger would be awesome... but I have no intention of joining the team anytime soon. I've heard Captain America's recruitment pitch often enough to know it's not for me right now.\" He winks at Steve. \"So you better plan to stick around for a long time, you hear me? The Avengers need Iron Man, but more than that they need Tony Stark.\"</p>\n<p>\"Which is a good thing,\" Pepper adds. \"Because Tony Stark adds a lot more value to the team than I think you realize. But I'll let them tell you about that.\" She leans forward and kisses Tony on the cheek. \"Rhodey and I dropped by the mansion last night to see your 'bots. I think they miss you. Dummy grabbed Rhodey's shirt and wouldn't let go.\"</p>\n<p>\"I had to bribe him with my pocket flashlight to get him to release me,\" Rhodey says. \"And I only have two more Army-issued flashlights left, so you better get well soon.\"</p>\n<p>\"You went to see my 'bots?\" Tony echoes, surprised now, his eyes wide. </p>\n<p>\"Well, someone has to keep an eye on them. And Dummy likes me best, after all.\" Rhodey smiles teasingly. </p>\n<p>\"You keep telling yourself that,\" says Tony. His smile is a lot more tentative. \"Dummy likes Steve the best.\"</p>\n<p>It's the first time Tony has even acknowledged that he's in the room beyond a couple of curious looks. Steve jolts in surprise. \"I'm pretty sure you're Dummy's favorite, Tony,\" he says cautiously, buoyed by the encouraging smiles from Rhodey and Pepper. \"You're the only he makes smoothies for.\"</p>\n<p>Tony snorts. \"I'm the only one he tries to poison, you mean,\" he mutters, and then he yawns. </p>\n<p>Pepper leans forward, smoothing a few strands of hair away from his forehead. \"We're going to have another conversation about this later on when you're out of here,\" she says. \"Especially you and me. There were unresolved things we should have talked about before.\"</p>\n<p>\"Hate conversations,\" Tony mumbles, eyes heavily lidded. </p>\n<p>She huffs a laugh, and Steve pretends not to notice that her eyes are damp again. \"I know you do, but we're going to have some anyway.\"</p>\n<p>Tony mutters something else, but it's unintelligible. He's already asleep. Pepper brushes her thumb across his jaw and then leans forward to press a kiss to his cheek. \"You're such an idiot sometimes,\" she whispers, but so fondly that it makes Steve's throat ache. When she straightens up, she's giving Steve a firm look.</p>\n<p>\"We know that Tony has your name,\" she says, indicating Rhodey with a tip of her head. \"And Bucky's name. Just like, I'm guessing, you two have his.\"</p>\n<p>By way of response, Steve shows them the name written on the underside of his arm. He still remembers the day it showed up, before Bucky came back, and part of him regrets not going to Tony the moment he discovered it. \"We do. When Tony wakes up, we plan to talk to him about it. Court him, if he'll let us.\"</p>\n<p>Rhodey crosses his arms. \"So you plan to bring him into your relationship?\"</p>\n<p>\"If that's something Tony's interested in, yes.\"</p>\n<p>\"Why didn't you approach him before?\" Pepper asks.</p>\n<p>\"I can't speak for Bucky, but I didn't know he had my name. Our names. And I was - Tony is... special, and I'm already involved with Bucky. I... I was a coward. I should've said something to him. If I'd known what he was thinking...\" Steve trails off, looking down at Tony. He looks so damn fragile when he's sleeping, like anything could break him, and it hurts.</p>\n<p>\"The only reason why I'm not kicking your ass right now is because we've all fucked up. But if you hurt him any more than you already have, I'll kill you,\" Rhodey says. \"I don't care how hard it will be. I'll find a way. You and Barnes better tread carefully.\"</p>\n<p>\"And in the meantime, while Rhodey's figuring out how to kill you, I will ruin you,\" Pepper says, and she sounds almost cheerful. \"I mean it, Steve. I can fuck you up in ways you've never even dreamed. Ways that you can't fight against. Captain America might be untouchable, but Steve Rogers? He's just a man, and I've dealt with plenty of men in my time.\" Her smile is distinctly unpleasant, promising a world of pain. \"Tony is very important to us. Exercise caution with how you treat him.\"</p>\n<p>Steve feels an honest to God chill go down his spine. \"I will.\"</p>\n<p>\"Good.\" Pepper stands up. \"I have to get back to work, and so does Rhodey. We'll be back to visit him again tonight.\"</p>\n<p>He just nods, watching as they both kiss Tony on the forehead in goodbye, and walk out. Bucky slinks in about two minutes after they go, glancing over his shoulder like he thinks someone might come after him, and says, \"Hydra shoulda recruited her. They'd have taken over the world years ago if they had.\"</p>\n<p>\"I take it you got the shovel talk too,\" Steve says, and then, shuddering, adds, \"Don't even joke about that, Buck.\"</p>\n<p>Every time Tony wakes up, it hurts a little more. Which is a good sign, his brain tells him, because it means they\u2019re starting to wean him off the stronger drugs. But it\u2019s also a bad sign, because he keeps seeing Steve and Bucky in the room when he wakes up, and that clearly means he\u2019s sustained enough brain damage to hallucinate. It\u2019s the only explanation for why one or both super soldiers are at his bedside every time he opens his eyes. The weirdest thing is, the other people in the room seem to see them too \u2013 which is, potentially, a <i>very</i> bad sign.</p>\n<p>\u201cAm I hallucinating?\u201d he asks Bruce the next time he opens his eyes. Thor\u2019s there too, but the room is otherwise empty. He\u2019s surprised by how lonely that leaves him feeling, because even if he knows he's hallucinating, that doesn't mean he doesn't want Steve and Bucky around him. It turns out these pesky emotions are a lot harder to push aside when he\u2019s drugged.</p>\n<p>\u201cHallucinating?\u201d Bruce echoes, eyebrows drawing together. Tony\u2019s only seen him once or twice since he woke up, but there\u2019s new lines in Bruce\u2019s face. Even Thor seems burdened, and he\u2019s not sure why.</p>\n<p>\u201cI keep seeing Steve and Bucky hanging around. Actually, I keep seeing all of you in here and I don\u2019t know why. I thought maybe this was just a dream where I\u2019d been rescued. I had a lot of those in Afghanistan,\u201d he adds by way of explanation, and Bruce\u2019s and Thor\u2019s expressions go pinched in the exact same way.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis is no dream,\u201d Thor says after a moment. </p>\n<p>\u201cIsn\u2019t that what you would tell me in a dream?\u201d Tony points out.</p>\n<p>Thor sighs. \u201cI suppose it would. But tell me, did you frequently have the <i>same</i> dream in Afghanistan? When you slept, did you always reawaken in the same place, with the same people, where nothing was different?\u201d</p>\n<p>Tony pauses, stumped, because Thor\u2019s got him there. Sleep was a rare commodity back then, but when he passed out he did have a lot of dreams where he was rescued, and he definitely had some favorites. He dreamt about Rhodey storming the caves, about coming back to New York to find Obie waiting for him, about Pepper's hands on his face. But the smaller details were always different in some way, in the way that dreams are. </p>\n<p>Now, though. He always wakes up in the same bed, surrounded by the same equipment, with the same sights and smells. The scene out the window changes depending on whether it's day or night, but it's always the New York skyline. The same doctor and nurses come and go. The same janitor walks by the room at exactly half past two every morning, waking Tony up with the squeaky bucket.</p>\n<p>\u201cI am a god, and even in a dream I would not lie to you about something so important,\u201d Thor says, very gentle, and sets a hand on Tony\u2019s arm. \u201cYou are not dreaming, Tony Stark. You are awake.\u201d</p>\n<p>The thin fizzle of power emanating from Thor\u2019s fingertips makes the hair on Tony\u2019s arms stand on end. \u201cThen why?\u201d he says, not looking up at either of them. \u201cI don\u2019t get it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe watched you,\u201d says Bruce, and it\u2019s such a simple explanation, a \u2018duh\u2019 moment really, but Tony\u2019s been fighting not to string that together ever since he woke up with enough lucidity to remember the majority of his conversation with Pepper and Rhodey. He goes cold, because even though he doesn\u2019t remember everything that happened, he remembers running his mouth off about what the team really thinks about him.</p>\n<p>Still, he hadn\u2019t lied. He was honest. There's no reason for anyone to be mad. Slowly, he looks up. \u201cWatched me\u2026?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThey sent us footage,\u201d Thor says, grave now. Sparks dance in his eyes, the only hint of his anger. \u201cOf their transgressions, and of what you said in response. It grieves us all that you believe no one cares for you, or would care if you were to die. No one is easily replaced, but you least of all.\u201d</p>\n<p>To hear Thor lay it out so blatantly, where anyone else would\u2019ve danced around it, aches in a way that drugs can\u2019t help. Tony shakes his head, fumbling a laugh, and pats clumsily at Thor\u2019s hand. \u201cThanks, big guy, but I\u2019m pretty sure you\u2019re the only one who thinks that way.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTony. That\u2019s not true.\u201d Bruce looks pained. He\u2019s holding the clipboard with all of Tony\u2019s medical information on it a little too tightly, though there\u2019s no green to his features yet.</p>\n<p>\u201cActually, it is. Do you need me to run down the list?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s a list?\u201d Bruce says, then shakes his head. \u201cOf course there\u2019s a list. You know what, I\u2019ll let the others handle their bit later. But Tony \u2013 I don\u2019t need toys from you. You were the first person <i>ever</i> who honestly wasn\u2019t afraid of the other guy. That means more to me than anything else you have to offer. I didn\u2019t come back to the tower with you that day because you said you\u2019d give me a lab. I came back because you were, and still are, my friend.\u201d</p>\n<p>Tony swallows. \u201cBut you like your lab.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course I do. I\u2019m a scientist. SHIELD would\u2019ve given me a lab too, you know. And it would\u2019ve been filled with lots of people who flinch every time I walk by, who dive for cover when I drop something, and who would be terrified to touch me, much less poke me with sharp objects.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s for science,\u201d Tony says automatically, and Bruce just smiles at him. Tony can't bring himself to smile back, and not just because his whole body is starting to hurt. He can't let himself have this, can he?</p>\n<p>\u201cWas it also for science when you opened your home to me?\u201d Thor asks him. \u201cYou made me, and my fair Jane and her friends, feel welcome in your home, even though it was not necessary. You offer food and shelter and fix the damage I inadvertently cause, and you never ask anything in return, except that I stand beside you both in battle and off. Does that not make us shield brothers?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2026\u201d Tony is speechless in the face of their combined earnestness. Out of the whole team, he thought that maybe Bruce and Thor might tolerate him the most. Thor likes everyone, and Bruce seems to dislike everyone equally. But this? This level of friendship is more than he hoped for. He turns to Bruce and lamely finishes with, \u201cBut I <i>poke</i> you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Bruce shrugs. \u201cIt\u2019s for science,\u201d he says with a smirk. \u201cAnd Tony, I\u2019ve had a hell of a lot worse. I trust you not to take it too far.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAs do I,\u201d Thor says. \u201cI would trust you with the life of my fair Jane, and with the inner workings of the Bifrost.\u201d</p>\n<p>Tony\u2019s mouth falls open. This is something he\u2019s never dared to ask for, but he\u2019s not even surprised that Thor\u2019s guessed he wants to know. It takes effort to squeak out, \u201cWhat?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhen you are well, I will tell you all you wish to know.\u201d Thor pats his arm, hard enough to leave a bruise on top of all Tony's other bruises, and takes a step back. \u201cFor we are shield brothers, and there is nothing I would not trust you with.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, that\u2019s a mistake,\u201d Tony breathes, rattled to his core. It\u2019s hard not to be when a god is looking him in the eyes and saying those kinds of things. Or maybe that\u2019s just the pain, because Thor patting his arm has set off a full scale chain reaction and now everything hurts.</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so,\u201d says Bruce. \u201cI think that those secrets would be safer with you than anyone else on Earth. And I\u2019m not just saying that, either. I mean it.\u201d He finally sets the clipboard down on the end of Tony\u2019s bed. \u201cYou should know the other guy feels the same way. He wouldn\u2019t bother to work with or save anyone he thought was a fuck-up.\u201d</p>\n<p>Tony just stares at him for a long time, then looks at Thor, before looking back at Bruce, now more than ever convinced he\u2019s hallucinating. In the end, the only thing he can think to ask is, \u201cWait, what did you mean when you said you\u2019d let the others handle their bit later?\u201d</p>\n<p>Bruce chuckles fondly. \u201cOh Tony.\u201d</p>\n<p>The door opens and a nurse slips in, carrying a by now familiar syringe. The one that means he\u2019ll shortly be unconscious thanks to pain medication. He says quickly, \u201cNo, I mean it! And \u2013 does that mean Bucky and Steve have really been in here all those times? Why? Is Steve going to yell? Are they mad at me?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNot mad. Definitely not mad,\u201d Bruce says. He mutters something to the nurse, while Tony turns a panic-filled gaze on Thor. Thor smiles comfortingly back, but it only serves to make Tony even more panicked. If none of this is a hallucination, what does it <i>mean</i>? Is he getting hospital care only to end up dead, courtesy of Captain America and the Winter Soldier? If so, he\u2019d rather they get it over with now.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d he demands as the nurse pushes the syringe into his I.V. He starts to push himself up, ready to get some answers, and ends up groaning in pain instead as his ribs vehemently protest.</p>\n<p>\u201cJust relax, Tony, okay? No one\u2019s going to hurt you. Not ever again.\u201d Despite claiming he\u2019s not a doctor, Bruce has the bedside manner down pat. His voice is very soothing to listen to, and against his will Tony finds himself relaxing back against the pillows. The medication leaves him feeling like he\u2019s floating, and the pain subsides so quickly it\u2019s dizzying.</p>\n<p>The nurse finishes fiddling around with the I.V., nods at Bruce and Thor, and walks out. As she leaves, a metal hand catches the door and Bucky slips in. Tony tries to feel the same sense of panic as before, but it\u2019s beyond his grasp. Fatigue is weighing him down, dragging him below the panic and fear. </p>\n<p>\u201cYou and Steve need to talk to him,\u201d says Bruce, giving Bucky a firm look. \u201cYou can\u2019t keep putting it off. He\u2019s aware enough now for that conversation.\u201d</p>\n<p>What conversation? Tony wants to ask. He blinks heavily as Bucky meets his gaze, surprised to find that there\u2019s no anger in Bucky\u2019s eyes. Just something Tony can\u2019t identify. His tongue refuses to create words, though, and when he goes to blink again his eyes remain shut. The world slips away and he sleeps dreamlessly, not waking up again until the squeaking bucket rattles by. That\u2019s impossible to sleep through, not when he\u2019s itching to grab a screwdriver and fix the damn thing already.</p>\n<p>The room is dark when he opens his eyes, but not so dark that Tony can\u2019t tell that there\u2019s a spy on either side of him. Steve is passed out in one of the visitor\u2019s chairs, and Tony\u2019s bed \u2013 which seemed large before, but is definitely too small to comfortably accommodate three people \u2013 has a third spy perched on the end of it. His head is resting against Natasha\u2019s chest, pillowed comfortably on her breasts, and Clint is idly trailing fingers up and down Tony\u2019s un-bandaged shoulder, and Coulson has a hand on his ankle.</p>\n<p>\u201cDid I die?\u201d Tony croaks, thoroughly bewildered. \u201cI always thought heaven would have hot people, but with more nudity.\u201d</p>\n<p>Coulson snorts. \u201cI\u2019m going to pretend that you didn\u2019t just imply you think I\u2019m hot, and I hardly think your version of heaven involves a hospital room, Tony.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re calling me Tony. I <i>am</i> dead. Or hallucinating.\u201d</p>\n<p>Clint pinches him. Tony yelps. \u201cNo pain in hallucinations,\u201d Clint says with a grin.</p>\n<p>Tony glares at him. \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure that\u2019s dreams, and you shouldn\u2019t be mean to someone who\u2019s just been kidnapped,\u201d he says sulkily.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, about that,\u201d Clint says, smile vanishing, replaced by a level of seriousness that seems foreign. \u201cYou really think all that shit, huh. You really think I\u2019d throw myself off a roof and trust just anyone to catch me? Thanks a lot. I didn\u2019t think you thought I was that stupid.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou stole a pair of Natasha\u2019s panties,\u201d Tony says, because his mouth is stupid like that, and feels both Natasha and Clint freeze.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou what,\u201d Natasha says in a voice that promises Pain and Death, and Clint winces, and this \u2013 this is why no one likes him. Tony has no idea what he\u2019s doing here between them, and he wants so badly to understand why they\u2019re fucking with him. </p>\n<p>It\u2019s Coulson who says, very patiently, \u201cWhat they\u2019re trying to say, without actually coming right out and saying it, is that you\u2019re wrong and they like you. Forgive them. All SHEILD agents have difficulty with communication. It seems to be a prerequisite for the job.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFuck you,\u201d Clint says with no real malice, aiming a playful kick in his handler\u2019s direction. Coulson dodges it easily with a fond smile that makes Tony\u2019s stomach roll, because it\u2019s aimed at all three of them.</p>\n<p>Natasha shakes her head at both of them, and the sweep of her hair over Tony\u2019s neck prompts a shiver. She catches his chin before he can put space between them, guiding his head up so their eyes meet. \u201cI don\u2019t often admit when I\u2019m wrong,\u201d she says quietly. \u201cBut in this case, I\u2019ll make an exception. I made an unfair call against you when we first met. I can\u2019t say that anyone is at their best when they\u2019re dying.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou weren\u2019t wrong,\u201d Tony croaks. </p>\n<p>\u201cYes, I was. It\u2019s true that Loki forced our hand, but even if you kicked us all out tomorrow we\u2019d still want you on the team. You, not the Iron Patriot.\u201d Her tone allows for no argument, but because Tony is himself, he can\u2019t help it. </p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe that. Cap harps at me for not following orders and not being a team player constantly. I\u2019m just \u2013\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe guy who makes us all look pretty,\u201d Clint interrupts, leaning close enough that Tony\u2019s completely bracketed between the two of them, heat on both sides. \u201cI\u2019ll have you know I\u2019m pretty enough on my own. Your toys can\u2019t hold a candle to SHIELD\u2019s, Tones, and I\u2019d appreciate it if you don\u2019t take them away. But I\u2019d take a night of getting drunk and eating junk food and playing video games with you over a new set of arrows.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd it\u2019s true that you don\u2019t always listen,\u201d says Coulson, leveling a firm look his way. \u201cBut when it matters, you\u2019ve taken orders before and I have no doubt in my mind that you\u2019ll do it again. Remember two weeks ago, when you obeyed a direct order from Cap to change position and you ended up saving about a hundred people?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOr six weeks ago, when I jumped off three buildings in a row and you caught me every time even though you definitely had more important places to be,\u201d says Clint. \u201cDo you know how hard my heart was pounding the first time I did that? Now I don\u2019t even hesitate. I just <i>know</i> you\u2019ll be there.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou could hesitate a little,\u201d Coulson mutters, rolling his eyes.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019d rather you take us out of your will, if this is what you think,\u201d says Natasha. </p>\n<p>\u201cWhat? No!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes. We don\u2019t need your money. We were fine without it before, and all of us would be fine without it now.\u201d Catching his expression, her face softens a little. \u201cTony, I was there when you were dying last time. I didn\u2019t know you very well at the time. I was under cover, and I make it a point to not get overly close to my targets. But I know you now. I don\u2019t often give people the title of friend. I give out the title of teammate even less. To me, you are both. I\u2019ve already rescinded that recommendation I gave Fury; had I known then what I know now, which is that you are also kind, generous, and self-sacrificing, I never would have given it. Loki did us a favor in the end.\u201d</p>\n<p>Tony stares at her before looking around, but Coulson is nodding in agreement and he can feel Clint doing the same against his back. \u201cNone of this makes any sense,\u201d he says shakily. \u201cI thought \u2013\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou thought that we all hated you and just put up with you because we had to,\u201d says Clint. \u201cYeah, well, you\u2019re wrong. I\u2019ll be honest, maybe it was like that at first. But at first, I also thought Steve was some uptight golden boy and that Bruce would explode into a monster if you gave him a sideways look. I\u2019m pretty sure you also thought some unpleasant things about me and Natasha. Impressions change. We\u2019ve been living together for like four years now. Pretty sure no one would stick around for that long just for money, right?\u201d</p>\n<p>Almost against his will Tony nods, because Clint has a point: none of the people who\u2019d been after his fame or money or sex had stuck around for more than a few months. Tiberius Stone was the longest at just over seven months, wanting all of the above, before growing tired of the charade and dumping him in a humiliatingly public spectacle. There\u2019s Obie, too, but that was never about what Tony could give him - just what Howard Stark had built. And Pepper and Rhodey, but the last, niggling bit of doubt about them and why they\u2019ve bothered to stick around over the years has been eased. </p>\n<p>\u201cSo get it through your thick head already. We\u2019re a team, and a pretty damn good one at that. I know Rhodey\u2019s a cool guy, but we don\u2019t need a yes man on the team. You think Cap would be half as good if he didn\u2019t have you to challenge him? Or Bucky. He wouldn\u2019t be as far along now as he is if you weren\u2019t here. None of us would.\u201d Clint\u2019s nose bumps against his spine.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re an official Avenger,\u201d Coulson says. \u201cNo one can take that away from you. Not even SHIELD. And I\u2019m certain anyone who tried would have a mutiny on their hands.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTo say the least.\u201d Natasha\u2019s fingers stroke through Tony\u2019s hair, exerting just the right amount of pressure, and guide his head back down against her breasts. \u201cFor a genius, you can be remarkably oblivious sometimes, kotyonok. We will always come for you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cEven if SHIELD says not to?\u201d Tony says, because he can\u2019t leave well enough alone, and he can\u2019t just be quiet. That might make the tears burning behind his eyes too real. He can hardly believe this is happening, that these people \u2013 these really fucking important people \u2013 seem to like him. Maybe even love him.</p>\n<p>\u201cTechnically, Natasha and Clint are considered SHIELD liaisons. But off paper they\u2019re Avengers, not agents,\u201d says Coulson. \u201cTheir loyalty is to the team. They have the ability to turn down a mission from SHIELD, and the Avengers will always come first.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhich basically means yes. Even if Fury said no, we\u2019d still come get you,\u201d Clint says. </p>\n<p>\u201cAnd you?\u201d Tony looks at Coulson.</p>\n<p>\u201cAs the Avengers handler, I have been charged with keeping you all as safe and healthy. Kidnapping goes against that, so naturally it would be my responsibility to see you home in one piece,\u201d Coulson answers as blandly as possible. Then, against all odds, he actually cracks another smile. \u201cI did cut you free from that chair, did I not?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Tony says, more than a little dazed. He definitely didn\u2019t think Coulson, of all people, liked him. His eyes are going blurry now, like that\u2019s the cherry on top of everything, and he puts his face against Natasha\u2019s neck for a few seconds to recoup. When he speaks, his voice comes out cracked. \u201cThanks for that, Agent.\u201d</p>\n<p>Coulson just nods. He still has his hand on Tony\u2019s ankle, and he rubs his thumb across the top of Tony\u2019s foot. \u201cYou should know that not all relationships with three soulmates are doomed to fail.\u201d</p>\n<p>It takes Tony a moment. He blames it on the medication. When it clicks, his eyes go wide. \u201cWhat \u2013 seriously? The three of you?\u201d Because yeah, he\u2019s wondered. Everyone has. Natasha, Clint and Coulson gravitate around each other, but there doesn\u2019t seem to be any center. Over the years, Tony\u2019s been equally certain that any combination of them are dating. And while it\u2019s occurred to him before that maybe it was the three of them, he never extended that thought all the way to soulmates.</p>\n<p>Clint shows him, sitting up and pulling his pants and boxers down to show off his hips. Natasha\u2019s name is written across his right hip, and Coulson\u2019s name is scrawled across his left. The ink is dark, as though fresh. Natasha strokes Tony\u2019s hair again and he looks up at her, a question in his eyes, and she nods with an unspoken answer. </p>\n<p>\u201cThe Red Room discouraged soulmates,\u201d she says in a low voice. \u201cThose who had names were killed. It wasn\u2019t until after I defected that I received my first name.\u201d</p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t ask whether it was Clint\u2019s name or Coulson\u2019s, because it doesn\u2019t matter. \u201cIt\u2019s not the same. They don\u2019t \u2013\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIf the next words out of your mouth are \u2018like me\u2019, I\u2019m going to have to punch you,\u201d Clint says, pulling his pants up. He curls back up against Tony, impossibly closer, going so far as to very carefully drape a leg over Tony\u2019s thigh and an arm over Tony\u2019s hip, hand resting on Natasha\u2019s hip. Somehow, he does it without ever once aggravating any of Tony\u2019s numerous and painful injuries. </p>\n<p>\u201cWell, they don\u2019t,\u201d Tony grumbles.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s bullshit and you know it,\u201d Natasha says frankly. \u201cSteve didn\u2019t like you for about as long as it took for him to get out of range of Loki and that stupid scepter. Then he was just was confused by you and the world in general, and he covered it up by indulging in petty bickering. I guarantee you it only took about six months for Steve to fall head over heels in love with you. And as for Bucky, well, I don\u2019t think he ever had much of a chance. Steve sings your praises so much it was inevitable.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe what?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s true. It grows tiring after the first twenty minutes,\u201d says Coulson. \u201cNot even for Captain America would I sit through two hours of why Tony Stark is amazing.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, but he sat through an hour and 59 minutes,\u201d Clint whispers in Tony\u2019s ear, sniggering. Tony\u2019s face hurts with the effort it takes not to smile, and Coulson mock-glares at them both.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe point is, this kind of relationship can be complicated. It\u2019s not the sort of thing people just fall into.\u201d Natasha sounds like she\u2019s speaking from experience. \u201cYou thought they didn\u2019t want you, and they thought you wouldn\u2019t want them. Basically you were all too chicken to do anything about what you wanted.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFuck you,\u201d Tony says without heat, mind spinning. It\u2019s been one revelation after another, and this last one feels way too huge. There\u2019s no way it can be true. Steve and Bucky wouldn\u2019t be interested in him like that. What they\u2019ve got is a fairy tale come to life, and how could Tony possibly compete with that? He\u2019s nothing. He doesn\u2019t even have a right to their names, and from the moment he first admitted to himself that he was in love, it\u2019s been tainted with the feeling that he\u2019s taken something without permission and he should be ashamed of himself.</p>\n<p>Okay, maybe he can see how he was wrong about the rest of the team. He was working from incorrect data. He\u2019s a scientist. When you have a bunch of data that all points to the same conclusion \u2013 such as everyone who has ever been around in the past having done so for the point of getting money, fame, sex, or something else from him \u2013 you tend to assume that all future data will be the same way. He\u2019s willing to accept that he might have been seeing the situation from a biased view.</p>\n<p>But this? Yeah, he\u2019s pretty sure that Natasha, Clint and Coulson are the ones seeing things that aren\u2019t really there. Maybe Steve and Bucky don\u2019t hate him. Maybe they wouldn\u2019t be angry at finding out he has their names written on his body. Jesus, maybe they\u2019ll pity him. Tony doesn\u2019t think he could handle that. He\u2019d rather they killed him. At least when he thought the team hated him, he knew he had their respect him as Iron Man. Walking around having to look at the happy couple, knowing that they pity him, would be more than he can bear.</p>\n<p>So maybe it\u2019s time to go for the old excuse, then. When he and Pepper started dating and she saw Steve\u2019s name for the first time, her expression had taken on that pinched look Tony dreads so much. He\u2019d told her the truth: Steve Rogers\u2019 name had appeared on his chest when he was only eight years old, right in the middle of his Captain America worship phase. It never disappeared, not even when he hit thirteen and decided he hated everything about Captain America for reasons that had very little to do with Captain America (thank you very much, Howard). </p>\n<p>It was the truth and Pepper accepted it, but she must have wondered. They broke up before it ever became an issue, and as much as it hurt, it was probably for the best. Tony didn\u2019t have the heart to tell her the rest. That Captain America was incredible, but Steve Rogers was just\u2026 amazing. An ordinary, amazing guy that Tony didn\u2019t even realize he was falling in love with until it was too late. </p>\n<p>And then Bucky came to the tower, and Tony was just fucked. He didn\u2019t get along well with Bucky at first, but bit by bit \u2013 as Hydra\u2019s conditioning wore off, and the real Bucky started coming forward \u2013 that changed. He came to know the ballsy, mouthy little shit that had kept Steve from getting killed in dark alleys. The guy who loved to bake, who grumbled about the future like an old man, who made instant friends with Bruce. And then it really was a good thing that he and Pepper had split, because Tony had distracted her when it came to Steve\u2019s name\u2026 but he never would\u2019ve been able to explain the appearance of Bucky\u2019s.</p>\n<p>But who could blame him? They\u2019re both hot, but it goes way deeper than that. And seeing the two of them together\u2026 Tony aches to know what it\u2019s like to be hugged by Steve, or wake up in Bucky\u2019s arms. Because it's not even about the sex. He just wants <i>them</i>. He wants Steve\u2019s annoying morning person habits and his sarcastic remarks and his cheating at video games. He wants Bucky\u2019s hard-won smiles, rare as they are, and tendency to steal all the milk and flirting remarks that make Tony\u2019s heart race. </p>\n<p>He wants them so, so much, but he\u2019s never gonna have them. He can have everything else, maybe even their friendship, but not that. That\u2019s the realization that pushes him over the edge and makes the tears finally come, rolling down his face. He hides between Natasha and Clint and cries, while Coulson rubs his leg and the three of them watch over him.</p>\n<p>Bucky is baking. Or stress baking, depending on who you ask, but since the end result is delicious food that he doesn\u2019t share with people who say he stress bakes, no one says that to his face. Anyway. The point is, he\u2019s baking. He carefully scoops an equal portion of chocolate batter into all twenty-four cupcake wrappers and sets them on top of the stove. He flips the oven door down, releasing a blast of hot, steaming air, and switches out the baked cupcakes for the unbaked ones.</p>\n<p>They\u2019re hot, and will need to cool before he can do much of anything with them, but that\u2019s fine. There\u2019s another four trays of vanilla cupcakes already sitting on the table, ready for decoration. He whips together a bowl of coffee-chocolate ganache made from the highest grade of chocolate and those expensive coffee beans Tony likes so much, grabs a piping bag and fills all forty-eight cupcakes to bursting. Then, on top, he swirls on a simple mocha icing. </p>\n<p>\u201cWow,\u201d Clint says behind him. \u201cTony is going to <i>love</i> you.\u201d He makes a face as soon as he says it, apparently realizing he\u2019s being the very opposite of subtle right now, and gives Bucky pleading eyes. \u201cSorry. Does this mean I can\u2019t have a cupcake?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOne,\u201d Bucky says, rolling his eyes, and Clint pounces on the cupcake like he\u2019s starving. It never ceases to make the knot in Bucky\u2019s chest loosen a little when he watches one of the team eat his desserts. He knows they accepted him a long time ago, but there's no doubt in his mind that, at first, that was purely for Steve\u2019s benefit. And sure, he fights and lives with the team, but every bite feels a little more like acceptance for himself.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo,\u201d Clint says, cupcake safely in hand, \u201cWhen are you guys talking to Tony? Because I have to tell you, the answer better be soon or I am obligated to put an arrow in your back.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSteve didn\u2019t think it would be a good idea to talk to him at the hospital. He said Tony would think we were just being kind because of what happened,\u201d Bucky says grumpily, stabbing a little too hard at his bowl of cookie batter. He can see where Steve\u2019s coming from, and he\u2019s probably right \u2013 but that doesn\u2019t mean Bucky likes it. He\u2019s had a lot of missed opportunities, and he\u2019s determined that Tony won\u2019t be one of them. It\u2019s so hard to sit in the same room as Tony and not touch him or kiss him the way Bucky wants to.</p>\n<p>Clint pulls another face. \u201cYeah, no, not cool.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI know. I said the same thing. But you know how Steve gets when he has an idea in his head. Stubborn as all out. And it has to be the two of us at the same time, or Tony\u2019s going to think that we\u2019ve broken up because of him.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cToo stubborn for his own good,\u201d Clint mumbles around a mouthful of ganache. \u201cBut you are going to tell him, right? \u2018Cause he is seriously strung out on the both of you. He wasn\u2019t even this far gone on Pepper. I know he was on heavy pain medication, but I haven\u2019t seen him cry like that <i>ever</i>.\u201d</p>\n<p>Bucky winces, shame prickling at the back of his neck. He felt about an inch tall during Clint\u2019s explanation of what happened at the hospital. It's been the unspoken elephant in the room for the past week. Tony hasn't brought it up, of course, and once he realized that Steve and Bucky were acting normally, appeared to consider the matter forgotten. There's no doubt in Bucky's mind that if Tony had his way, the names written on Tony's skin would never be brought up again.</p>\n<p>Which isn't going to happen, naturally. Tony's coming home today, the earliest that the doctors and Bruce would allow him to leave, and they're going to talk to him tonight. It can't come soon enough as far as Bucky's concerned, because Tony has been so damn <i>sweet</i> this entire time - and it's completely unintentional. Tony knows that Bucky is still deeply uncomfortable in a medical environment, and so he's been fussing over Bucky and insisting that Bucky takes breaks and even refusing to take pain medication until Bucky goes home to rest. That's why he isn't there now, because Tony demanded he leave and take a break even though his body language had been a clear indicator that he would've much rather Bucky stayed. </p>\n<p>\"He's too good for us,\" Bucky says frankly, well aware of the heaviness of Clint's gaze on his shoulders as he turns to the oven. They all know that. Tony is an amazing person, but he can't see it. His opinion of himself is too warped. For Tony's sake, he makes himself speak. \"But if we're what he wants, Steve and I are thrilled. I love him, Clint. I love him even though I didn't think I would be capable of loving anyone else except for Steve. I'm still not sure when it happened, or how, but there's not a day that goes by that I'm not really fucking glad that it did.\"</p>\n<p>Clint exhales noisily and steps closer, clapping a hand on Bucky's flesh shoulder. \"Then you two better figure out a way to show it. Right now he thinks that you two are too kind to say anything to his face. But if I know Tony, he's just waiting for the bomb to explode in his face. The second he gets home, he's gonna lock himself in his workshop to avoid talking to you guys.\"</p>\n<p>\"I know,\" Bucky says, more to himself than to Clint, because he's intimately familiar with how much easier it is to lock yourself away than deal with your problems. Back when he first came to the tower, he used to be so jealous of Tony, both for having a private space and the work to lose himself in. Bucky doesn't have work like that, though he has hobbies now: baking, and meditation, and knitting, and baseball - the list is a work in progress, because he's still cultivating the things that he likes. He knows the temptation to bake for hours instead of thinking about a dream, or knit two new sweaters to avoid going to sleep. He looks around at the kitchen, at the six dozen cookies and two cakes and three pies and cooling cupcakes, and feels a little silly.</p>\n<p>\"Hey, no, I recognize that look. That's your 'I feel like I should hide the evidence of what I've been doing for the past several hours and throw out all this stuff' look. Don't even think about it.\" Clint makes a possessive grab for one of the pies and hugs it to his chest, eyeing Bucky like he's prepared to go into battle to defend it. Bucky just gives him an amused look, not sure if he likes it that Clint can read his facial expressions that easily. He's not sure when that happened, either. It seems to be a running theme when it comes to the Avengers.</p>\n<p>\"I wasn't going to throw it all out.\"</p>\n<p>\"Don't throw any of it out! Dude, seriously, I will fight you.\"</p>\n<p>\"You're welcome to try,\" Bucky says, not without fondness. \"But you wouldn't win.\"</p>\n<p>\"If I may,\" JARVIS interrupts, which is fortunate for Clint's sake because he was just about to say something that he'll likely regret. \"Sir has arrived home with Captain Rogers, Miss Potts and Colonel Rhodes.\"</p>\n<p>Bucky turns to Clint. \"You can have a whole pie to yourself if you take those cupcakes out in exactly seven minutes.\"</p>\n<p>\"Sold! Good luck,\" Clint yells at his retreating back.</p>\n<p>Since Tony will be taking the elevator, Bucky grabs a plate of cupcakes and takes the stairs. He makes it to Tony's floor just in time to see the elevator doors opening. Pepper walks out first, and something in Bucky's stomach shrivels up because <i>damn</i> that woman can be frightening. Rhodey and Steve are right behind her, each supporting a sulking Tony. Bruce is the last one out of the elevator, carrying a white bag in his hands. </p>\n<p>\"Seriously, I'm fine,\" Tony says.</p>\n<p>\"You are not fine,\" Rhodey and Steve say together, then exchange identical exasperated looks over Tony's head.</p>\n<p>\"I totally am! Brucie, back me up.\"</p>\n<p>\"You're not fine,\" Bruce says, completely deadpan. \"To the bed, gentleman, please.\"</p>\n<p>\"Traitor,\" Tony mutters, sulking, but not even he can hide the grimace when he's lowered onto his bed. The bruises are beginning to fade, but one of his legs and one arm are still encased in a cast - not to mention his bandaged shoulder and upper back. And his movements are jerky and pained from his ribs. That still doesn't stop him from sitting upright and crossing his arms.</p>\n<p>\"You can call me a traitor as much as you want. It's not healthy or safe for you to be in your workshop right now, Tony. You're still taking high doses of antibiotics and pain medication.\"</p>\n<p>\"Then I'll stop taking the pain medication. Problem solved.\"</p>\n<p>\"I don't think so,\" Bruce says. \"But nice try.\"</p>\n<p>\"But I'm so behind on everything I was making for Stark Industries,\" Tony wheedles. Steve snorts, shooting a grin in Bucky's direction as Pepper puts her hand on her hips.</p>\n<p>\"Don't even think about using that as an excuse, Tony Stark. Your health is more important. I can handle the board.\" And indeed, Pepper looks like she's ready to charge into battle. </p>\n<p>\"Think of it as a vacation,\" says Rhodey, playfully ruffling Tony's hair. </p>\n<p>\"My vacations usually involve a lot more naked people,\" Tony says, customary leer present on his face, but Bucky's positive he's not the only one to notice that it doesn't reach Tony's eyes.</p>\n<p>\"And that is my cue to head out. I saw more than enough of your naked butt in college.\" Rhodey ducks down, wrapping a careful arm around Tony's shoulders, and hugs him very carefully. \"I have to go handle a few things. Apparently everything falls apart when I'm not around. But I'll be in the area, and I'll be dropping by regularly until you're back on your feet.\"</p>\n<p>\"You gonna help the team out?\" Tony asks. </p>\n<p>\"Tony -\"</p>\n<p>\"Cause I want you to.\"</p>\n<p>Rhodey hesitates. \"Tones -\"</p>\n<p>\"I mean it. I know what I said about - you know.\" Tony waves his hand limply. \"But the team might... might need you.\" </p>\n<p>It's probably the last thing Rhodey wants to agree to right now, but Tony's pretty hard to say no to on a good day. \"Yeah, you dork. I said I'd be around and I meant it. If your team needs me, I'm not going to bail on them. You need them too much for that.\"</p>\n<p>Tony nods once, a jerky movement that makes Bucky wince, and straightens up. \"Then you better get going before Captain Hard-ass over there decides you need to join the training rotation.\"</p>\n<p>\"That training is good for you,\" Steve says, crossing his arms defensively. </p>\n<p>\"Good for making me crazy, you mean,\" says Tony, but he's smiling this soft little smile, and when he says goodbye to Pepper and Rhodey he almost seems like he's in good spirits. Rhodey points two fingers at his eyes and then gestures at Steve and Bucky as soon as Tony turns away. It's a little scary, but not nearly as frightening as the way Pepper smiles at them both as she guides Rhodey out of the room. </p>\n<p>Seriously, Hydra missed their calling on that one.</p>\n<p>\"I've enlisted JARVIS to remind you to take your medication on time,\" Bruce is saying, setting out at least half a dozen pill bottles on the table. Bucky's not familiar with modern medication, especially of the pain variety, but it looks like a lot more than just some antibiotics. \"You have to make sure you take it, Tony, and that includes your pain meds. Don't wait until you're in agony before you take one, no matter how weird the higher dosage makes you feel. And remember, you're not supposed to take them with alcohol or caffeine.\"</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, yeah.\u201d</p>\n<p>Bruce looks at him, then turns to Steve. \u201cI\u2019m putting you in charge of making sure he takes his medication, Steve.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHey!\u201d Tony protests. \u201cI\u2019m not a kid.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, you just act like one,\u201d Bruce says, but his smile takes the sting out of it. \u201cI\u2019ve got some tests running I need to get back to, but call me if you start feeling strange. And no workshop time until your stitches come out, I mean it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cRude,\u201d Tony grumbles. He tries to cross his arms, but ends up wincing and letting his arms fall to his sides. Bucky sets the cupcakes down and takes advantage of the moment to slip closer and fix the pillows behind Tony, remembering how Steve used to like them: lying down, but with enough pillows on either side of his body that he was still supported. Judging by Tony\u2019s approving grumble, he likes it that way too.</p>\n<p>When Bucky next looks up, Bruce is gone and the three of them are alone in the room. Steve says, \u201cBruce said you haven\u2019t been eating much. You should try to eat something.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not hungry.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI made cupcakes,\u201d Bucky volunteers, and Tony\u2019s eyes fly open with sudden alertness.</p>\n<p>\u201cCupcakes? Where?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSoup first, then cupcakes,\u201d says Steve, mouth twitching.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou drive a hard bargain, Rogers,\u201d Tony says, not quite pouting. \u201cWhat kind of cupcakes?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThey\u2019ve got mocha frosting, and I won't tell Bruce if you don't.\u201d Bucky says, gesturing to the cupcakes.</p>\n<p>Tony actually moans. \u201cFine, I\u2019ll eat the stupid soup. Damn you both. I\u2019ll get you for exploiting my weakness.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019d feel more threatened if I weren\u2019t the only one who knows exactly how to make that frosting,\u201d says Bucky, sitting carefully on the edge of the bed while Steve retreats into the kitchen. Unfortunately, Bucky\u2019s skills in the kitchen do not extend to cooking. He likes baking in part because it requires precision and order, but cooking \u2013 where there is so much opportunity to change a recipe at whim \u2013 is harder. Steve, on the other hand, is one of the better cooks on the team, though he\u2019s not up to Bruce\u2019s level.</p>\n<p>With anyone else, he\u2019d probably hesitate to touch them with his metal hand, even another Avenger. He doesn\u2019t hesitate at all with Tony, sliding his fingers into Tony\u2019s hair and stroking his head. It\u2019s a risky move, and could easily result in Tony getting flustered or confused and pushing him away, but Tony just purrs like the kitten he insists he isn\u2019t and lets his head sink back against the pillows. </p>\n<p>\u201cThat feels nice,\u201d he murmurs, eyes glassy. \u201cMy head\u2019s been aching all morning.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you say something? You\u2019re probably due for another dose of pain medication.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t like how they make me feel. Like I\u2019m going to float away.\u201d</p>\n<p>Bucky can\u2019t argue against that. He wouldn\u2019t like that, either. But he also doesn\u2019t like seeing Tony in pain. \u201cI won\u2019t let you float away,\u201d he says. \u201cSteve and I are here. You\u2019re safe now, kotyonok.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNatasha called me that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not surprised.\u201d Tony\u2019s practically nuzzling his hand. It\u2019s adorable. Not wanting to disturb Tony, he continues to stroke Tony\u2019s head until Steve comes back into the room with a steaming cup of soup.</p>\n<p>\u201cUgh, do I really have to?\u201d Tony complains to no one in particular, trying to push himself up, biting his lip in pain the whole time. Bucky gently takes hold of his shoulders and helps him to sit, then slides behind Tony so that when Tony relaxes backwards, he\u2019s leaning against Bucky. Tony stiffens in surprise at the move, eyes darting to Steve, but Steve acts like there\u2019s nothing unusual about the scene at all and sits down on the bed right in front of them.</p>\n<p>\u201cHere. It\u2019s chicken noodle soup with the carrots picked out.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDo I want to know how you know that\u2019s how I like my soup?\u201d Tony asks warily, trying to take the mug from Steve. His hands are shaking too badly, though, and Steve has to help him take a careful sip. </p>\n<p>\u201cI know a lot about how everyone on the team likes their food. Clint\u2019s not a big fan of spicy food because it upsets his stomach. Coulson prefers vanilla over chocolate. Bruce loves coffee, but doesn\u2019t like anything coffee-flavored,\u201d Steve says. \u201cJust like I know that you\u2019re allergic to mint, and you prefer red meat over white, but you won\u2019t eat wild game. You pretend you take your coffee black, but really you like it the best with half a teaspoon of milk and a tablespoon of sugar. Your favorite sandwich is grilled cheese, but you also like straight peanut butter as long as it\u2019s on whole wheat bread. You like potatoes but not sweet potatoes, you can\u2019t stand carrots, and you\u2019re also not crazy about Vietnamese food but you pretend to enjoy it because Thor likes it so much. Shall I go on?\u201d</p>\n<p>Tony is staring at him like Steve\u2019s grown a second head. \u201cPlease don\u2019t. I\u2019m sufficiently creeped out. How the fuck do you know all of that?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ve been living together for four years now, Tony,\u201d Steve says, not unkindly. \u201cAnd you\u2019re important to me. Of course I notice these things about you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Bucky looks at Steve sharply. Steve meets his gaze, communicating an unspoken reassurance. This is it.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2026 I\u2026\u201d Tony is speechless.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m just sorry that I didn\u2019t make that clear to you sooner. I should have. <i>We</i> should have.\u201d</p>\n<p>Tony blinks once, squinting at Steve, and then he says, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to pretend,\u201d almost too quiet for them to hear. He\u2019s not lashing out with anger or embarrassment the way Bucky expected. In a way, this is worse. He sounds so defeated.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not pretending anything,\u201d says Steve.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah right. Look, Cap, I figured you were waiting to mention the whole soulmate thing. Didn\u2019t think I\u2019d get away without having a conversation about it. It\u2019s not a big deal. I know you two are dating. I know I\u2019m not \u2013\u201d Tony cuts off, breathing clicking audibly in his throat, at the look on Steve\u2019s face. \u201cI mean, I\u2019m not trying to come between you or anything. This is \u2013 it\u2019s a mistake, nothing else, and I\u2019d really appreciate it if you would just forget you ever saw it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat if we don\u2019t want to forget?\u201d Bucky says quietly, right in Tony\u2019s ear, and feels Tony shudder between them. </p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2026 why wouldn\u2019t you?\u201d Tony says, sounding bewildered and a little panicked. \u201cI\u2019ve been coping with it, okay, it won\u2019t affect the team, I promise. Please don\u2019t kick me off.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re not kicking you off the team!\u201d Steve exclaims, so scandalized at the idea that Bucky can\u2019t help smirking. \u201cTony, <i>no</i>, jesus. You\u2019re an important member of the team, and anyway Bucky and I have been waiting for this for a long time.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Tony whispers, still shaking, confused and uncertain but maybe \u2013 just a little \u2013 hopeful. It squeezes Bucky\u2019s heart.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m going to show you something,\u201d Bucky says. \u201cJust \u2013 bear with us, okay? This is something you really need to see.\u201d He shifts Tony\u2019s weight into the curve of his metal arm and grabs the zipper on his jeans. Tony is tense, and Bucky wishes that Tony\u2019s name had appeared somewhere less intimate. Can\u2019t change that, though, and he wiggles his jeans down off his hips as quickly as possible, inwardly cursing the modern world and their obsession with tight, clingy pants. When he spreads his legs, hitching up the material of his boxers, all of the color drains from Tony\u2019s face at the sight of the familiar, dark scrawl on Bucky\u2019s inner left thigh.</p>\n<p>His fingers are trembling when he reaches out, not quite touching the words, and then Steve says his name. They both look up to see that Steve\u2019s pulling his shirt off and is holding his arm up so that the identical words are visible on the underside of his right arm, near his armpit. Bucky regrets letting Tony lean against him then, because he wishes he could see what Tony\u2019s face looks like right now. </p>\n<p>\u201cThis appeared about three years ago,\u201d Steve says quietly. \u201cI didn\u2019t say anything because I wasn\u2019t ready for it. I know you were with Pepper then, but I wasn\u2019t ready to accept anyone else anyway. And then, when Bucky came back, I\u2019ll be honest. I thought your name would disappear, but it didn\u2019t. If anything, I wanted you more. I wanted you both.\u201d His expression flickers with guilt. \u201cEven when Bucky\u2026 I told myself we just needed the time to find our balance. I told myself we\u2019d reach out to you soon.\u201d</p>\n<p>Tony is still silent, so Bucky says, \u201cIt\u2019s not all on Steve. It took me forever to be okay with it, and even when I was I didn\u2019t know\u2026\u201d He sucks in a breath, because this is where it gets hard. He tips his head down, nosing against Tony\u2019s neck, needing the comfort. \u201cSteve isn\u2019t\u2026 who he used to be. He\u2019s different. And I am too, but it\u2019s hard. The flashes of my old Stevie are few and far between. I\u2026 I\u2019m selfish. I wanted you, but I also wanted to keep those for myself.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBuck\u2026\u201d Steve says. \u201cI didn\u2019t know that.\u201d</p>\n<p>Bucky shrugs a shoulder. \u201cWe\u2019ve both changed. I know you have the same difficulty. Didn\u2019t seem to be any point in announcing it. Point is, I was being dumb. We could\u2019ve had this all along.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThis?\u201d The word is more of a startled exhale, like Tony\u2019s still not sure how to talk.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis,\u201d Steve says firmly, taking Tony\u2019s hand and lacing their fingers together, bringing Tony\u2019s hand up and kissing the back of it. At the same time, Bucky kisses his cheek, liking the way the stubble feels under his lips.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2026 you\u2026 With me?\u201d Tony sounds so shocked. \u201cIs this\u2026 why?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCause you gave Steve a home,\u201d Bucky says, simple as that.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd you re-built Bucky\u2019s arm,\u201d Steve adds. \u201cIt can be as much or as little, or none at all, as you want it, Tony. We\u2019ll always be teammates, but I care about you a lot. I\u2019d like to date you, if you\u2019re open to that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMe too,\u201d says Bucky, quieter, and Tony shivers hard.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2026 I need to think,\u201d he says softly, shakily. \u201cI \u2013\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ll give you as much time as you need. We didn\u2019t mean to bombard you with this. It just \u2013 we were never angry, sweetheart. Finding out you care about me as much as I care about you \u2013\u201d Steve is carefully avoiding the \u2018love\u2019 word for the moment \u201c- and that you also care about Bucky is one of the best moments of my life. I hate that we had to find out through you being kidnapped. I\u2019ll always regret not being brave enough to say something first.\u201d</p>\n<p>Tony looks at Steve, then turns his head to look at Bucky. His face is so pale. \u201cI need to think,\u201d he says again.</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you want us to leave?\u201d Bucky asks, understanding what Tony won\u2019t ask for.</p>\n<p>\u201cPlease.\u201d</p>\n<p>Bucky doesn\u2019t want to leave, not when Tony feels so good beside him, but he carefully extracts himself from the bed and fluffs the pillows up in his place. While he\u2019s doing that, Steve gets a painkiller and helps Tony to wash it down with the last of the soup and puts the plate of cupcakes within easy reach. Tony watches all of this happen in nonplussed silence, eyebrows drawn together and mouth pinched like he wants to say something, but isn\u2019t sure what to say.</p>\n<p>As soon as they\u2019re out in the hall, Steve says, \u201cJARVIS, please tell whoever is next on Phil\u2019s list to come sit with Tony now, please.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, Captain Rogers. I will contact Thor and Dr. Foster now.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThanks.\u201d Steve turns to Bucky then, pulling him into a hard hug. Bucky can feel the tension in his body. He wraps his arms around Steve in turn and just holds him for a few minutes. They\u2019re still standing there, just holding onto each other, when Thor and Jane walk by and slip into the room. </p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>The pain medication does an excellent job of knocking Tony out when all he wants to do is analyze the fuck out of what just happened. He has just enough to eat one cupcake (which is fucking delicious), and then see Thor and Jane come in, but ends up falling asleep to Jane\u2019s voice explaining her most recent work on the Bifrost. His dreams are restless, though not nightmares, and he wakes up feeling like he hasn\u2019t really slept at all. Clint is sitting beside him on the bed, legs drawn up against his chest and head tilted back. His eyes are shut, but as soon as Tony shifts Clint looks down at him.</p>\n<p>\u201cWater?\u201d he asks, already reaching out for a cup. He helps Tony to sit up and drink from a straw. Tony drinks eagerly, but shakes his head when Clint offers him another painkiller. Clint frowns, but obligingly sets the painkiller aside and shakes out an antibiotic for Tony to take instead. </p>\n<p>\u201cTime\u2019s it?\u201d Tony asks roughly, rubbing at his eyes.</p>\n<p>\u201cNearly midnight. You slept a while. Need the bathroom?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah.\u201d It galls him to lean on Clint as they hobble towards the bathroom, particularly since Clint is all but carrying him, but it\u2019s infinitely better than the bedpan the nurses in the med bay had forced on him. He pees and feels better when he\u2019s done, washing his hands and choosing to sit on the bed instead of laying down. He needs to be vertical right now, and Clint doesn\u2019t try to make him lay down, just settles down on the bed beside him. They\u2019re quiet for a little while until Clint breaks the silence.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo I hear they finally said something.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou knew?\u201d Tony asks, not even surprised.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou three are kind of the worse kept secret of the team, and that\u2019s saying something.\u201d Clint slips an arm around his shoulders, letting Tony lean into him. \u201cAnd even for someone who had missed it, their little display when we rescued you was like a big, blinking red sign saying \u2018I love Tony Stark\u2019 in huge letters.\u201d</p>\n<p>Tony stiffens a little, dizzy at hearing those words come out of Clint\u2019s mouth. Up till now, he thought maybe that whole scene with Steve and Bucky was just a fanciful dream. He closes his eyes, trying to make sense of it all. Thinking about his name, <i>his name</i>, on Steve\u2019s arm and Bucky\u2019s thigh, written there for anyone to see. </p>\n<p>There are lots of potential soulmates out there for everyone. But names don\u2019t appear on your body unless you really, deeply care about someone and you're pretty well matched. That\u2019s part of what made his relationship with Pepper so hard: no matter how much Tony loved her, her name never appeared \u2013 whereas with Bucky and Steve, it was easy. He didn\u2019t even have to try. It was the same for Pepper: Tony used to watch her sometimes after she got out of the shower, the way she would look over every inch of herself in the mirror, as though Tony\u2019s name might have appeared without her notice. They loved each other, but they just weren\u2019t soulmates.</p>\n<p>He touches his chest, rubbing his thumb over the top curve of the \u2018S\u2019 in Steve\u2019s name. Everything he believed about his relationship with the team has been turned upside down this week. It\u2019s been proven to him frequently that they all enjoy his company and think of him as a friend. Natasha\u2019s rubbed the cramps out of his legs, Coulson and Bruce expedited his departure from the infirmary, Thor\u2019s promised to look into Asgardian healing methods. Clint\u2019s hugging him right now.</p>\n<p>And okay, Tony can kind of see where the wires were crossed. He\u2019s starting to accept the possibility that maybe they enjoy his presence for more than just money or fame or toys, weird as the idea sounds. But this? This is\u2026 just impossible. You can care deeply for someone without wanting to date them. He doesn\u2019t feel that way for Bucky and Steve \u2013 shit, it\u2019s disgusting how domestically happy he wants to be with them \u2013 but maybe they\u2019re just humoring him. Maybe this is their way of apologizing, or maybe they really do pity him. At this point he can\u2019t really tell what would be worse.</p>\n<p>\u201cI can tell what you\u2019re thinking,\u201d Clint says, lips pressed to Tony\u2019s temple. </p>\n<p>\u201cWhat are you, a mind reader?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMore like someone who\u2019s been there, done that. I had the exact same thoughts as you ten years ago. Still do.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI doubt that,\u201d Tony mutters.</p>\n<p>\u201cDoubt it all you wanted, but it\u2019s true. Three-way relationships aren\u2019t easy, Tony. They\u2019re infinitely more complicated, but also a hell of a lot more rewarding. Despite that, I get how hard it is to understand why two really amazing people would want you.\u201d There\u2019s a pang of wistfulness in Clint\u2019s voice that makes Tony lift his head and squint at him.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d he asks, curious, needing the distraction.</p>\n<p>\u201cIf I\u2019m telling a story, I need to get comfortable.\u201d Clint grabs a couple of pillows, drops his arm down to Tony\u2019s waist, and scoots them both backwards until they\u2019re reclining just right, with Clint\u2019s around his waist and his heat curled up against Tony\u2019s back.</p>\n<p>\u201cFor someone in a committed relationship, you sure do spoon me a lot,\u201d Tony observes.</p>\n<p>Clint sounds like he\u2019s smiling when he says, \u201cShut up. I like to be touched and so do you. You wanna hear me out or not?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGo ahead.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI was just a dumb kid when Phil and I crossed paths for the first time. By that point, I\u2019d left the circus and was making a living as an assassin. I was taking whatever jobs I could get my hands on, but I was good enough to be choosy about what I wanted. I was pretty much the best in the business, so I guess it was inevitable that I\u2019d cross SHIELD\u2019S radar sooner or later. They caught up to me on one of my jobs. I didn\u2019t know who they were, and naturally I wasn\u2019t a huge fan of government agencies that sent men in black suits to chase me around.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNaturally,\u201d Tony echoes, feeling himself start to relax. Clint\u2019s right, much as he hates to admit it: he does crave being touched, probably because he doesn\u2019t get human contact on a regular basis. The warmth against his back feels a hundred times better than any painkillers ever could.</p>\n<p>\u201cPhil wasn\u2019t one to take no for an answer, even then. He\u2019d noticed that there were some jobs, the worst of the bunch, that I turned down, and he was curious. I tried to run away. He shot me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe <i>shot</i> you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYup. Clean shot too, right through the meat of my thigh. Avoided any major arteries, of course. Left me limping like an idiot for the next two months. He still had to sedate me to get me into SHIELD, and eventually I ended up with a job offer.\u201d</p>\n<p>It doesn\u2019t escape Tony\u2019s notice that Clint is definitely skipping over a portion of the story, but for once he doesn\u2019t feel like it\u2019s his place to pry. So he just says, \u201cAnd Natasha?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat was my fault. I was supposed to take the infamous Black Widow down. I\u2019d always been told that my biggest failing as an assassin was my big heart, and they were right. I couldn\u2019t in good faith shoot someone who was sitting right out in the open like they were waiting to be shot. I recognized the look on her face.\u201d Clint\u2019s voice drops. \u201cLike she was waiting for the end to come.\u201d</p>\n<p>Tony swallows against the dryness in his throat, because he\u2019s been there too, and he doesn\u2019t like the thought that Natasha was ready to die. \u201cSo you didn\u2019t shoot her.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNope. I went off-grid. Phil was pissed as fuck. But it was worth every lecture, punishment and piece of paperwork to bring Natasha over to our side. It took her months to trust us, not that I blame her. And even though I didn\u2019t regret it, I thought I was so fucked.\u201d He huffs a laugh against the back of Tony\u2019s neck. \u201cFirst Phil\u2019s name, then hers. One right after the other, pretty much. I was freaking out, especially when we were sparring one day and Natasha ripped her shirt. I caught sight of Phil\u2019s name and pretty much figured that they were going to leave me in the dust. Thought I deserved it too.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDid it hurt?\u201d Tony whispers.</p>\n<p>\u201cWay worse than getting shot in the leg,\u201d Clint murmurs back. \u201cI got drunk a lot those first couple months when I was trying to come to terms with it. I don\u2019t know how you dealt with it for so long by yourself.\u201d</p>\n<p>Tony thinks back to endless nights of staring at his own body and hating himself. To the days he\u2019d watched Steve and Bucky interacting and felt so happy that they had each other again. To the mornings when he\u2019d wake up, full of dreams about having them both, and struggle not to cry. He thinks it was the closest approximation that exists to what the movies describe as a sweet ache. He didn\u2019t know you could be that happy and that sad at the same time.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnyway. Eventually Natasha caught up to me and told me I was being a dumbass. Turns out she thought the same thing as me, that Phil and I were going to get together and she\u2019d be the odd one out. Phil\u2019s never said anything, but it wouldn\u2019t surprise me if he had the same fears.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s different, though. Steve and Bucky have so much history,\u201d Tony can\u2019t help pointing out. \u201cThey grew up together, went off to war, lost each other. You saw them when Bucky first came back to the tower. I can\u2019t get between that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re not. You\u2019re not getting between anything. That\u2019s not what this is about, Tony. You have to stop thinking of a relationship as an all or none kind of situation. I love Phil, but that doesn\u2019t mean I love Natasha any less. Just like Natasha loving Phil doesn\u2019t mean she loves me any less. Don\u2019t get me wrong, this kind of situation doesn\u2019t work for everyone, but if there\u2019s even a slight chance you think you\u2019d be okay with that\u2026 Don\u2019t let your insecurities hold you back. They wouldn\u2019t offer this unless they meant it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNot even to keep me happy?\u201d Tony says quietly, hardly able to believe he\u2019s saying these words. But there\u2019s something about the darkness, about not seeing Clint\u2019s face, that makes it easier. \u201cNot even out of pity?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you really think that either one of them would do that?\u201d</p>\n<p>And the thing is, Tony doesn\u2019t. Not in his heart. Steve is the kind of person who likes to save everyone if he can. It\u2019s just the way he is. Maybe, if the situation were different and it wasn\u2019t Steve\u2019s most prized relationship and the team itself at risk, Steve might tell a little white lie. But Bucky? No way. Bucky is a blunt shit when he wants to be. He was the only one brave enough to tell Natasha that her new sweater was cut a little too low, because the rest of them were too concerned about having eyes gouged out for looking in that area in the first place. </p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d he admits, the word tasting strange. \u201cBut I just don\u2019t get why they\u2019d bother.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not gonna extol your virtues. Because I wonder the same thing about Natasha and Phil,\u201d Clint says seriously. \u201cThere are still nights when I think I\u2019ll wake up to find out they\u2019ve changed their minds. I still haven\u2019t convinced myself that won\u2019t happen; I probably never will. But I\u2019m gonna make damned sure I enjoy what time I have before it does.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 probably not healthy.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re Avengers, Tones. Being unhealthy kinda comes with their territory. I\u2019m not saying you have to do this. If you don\u2019t want to, just say no. But if you\u2019re just saying no because you think you should, that\u2019s stupid. You owe it to yourself to at least give this a shot.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd if it doesn\u2019t work out?\u201d Tony asks. Because it probably won\u2019t. He knows himself better than that. If he couldn\u2019t make Pepper stay, what hope does he have for anyone else?</p>\n<p>\u201cThen I promise you can have me during the divorce.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGee, thanks, birdbrain.\u201d</p>\n<p>Clint\u2019s grinning. \u201cAnytime.\u201d</p>\n<p>Thoughts are swirling around in Tony\u2019s brain. Let\u2019s say, just for fun, that Bucky and Steve really are interested in a relationship. There are still reasons why it won\u2019t work. For one thing, this would be <i>so bad</i> for Steve\u2019s reputation. It\u2019s bad enough he\u2019s dating Bucky, but at least that was mostly smoothed over by the whole reunited soulmates spiel. Not even the harshest critics could resist the tale of Captain America saving his brainwashed soulmate.</p>\n<p>But Tony? The media would have a field day at the news that Tony Stark is dating Captain America. He can see the headlines now. \u2018Stark Defiles National Icon\u2019. \u2018America Sinks to New Low\u2019. \u2018America and Money: Why Our Country is on Its Knees for Stark\u2019. He closes his eyes and bites back an exasperated groan. That\u2019s probably nothing compared to what the internet will come up with. He\u2019s pretty sure that almost everyone is going to think he\u2019s just trying to get between Steve and Bucky. His name is going to be trending on twitter, and not in a good way.</p>\n<p>Then there\u2019s the whole history thing. No matter what Clint says, he doesn\u2019t know how he can compete with what the two of them have shared. Bucky was there when Steve lost his mother. Steve was there when Bucky enlisted. He can\u2019t help thinking about everything they\u2019ve been through: Bucky leaving to go fight, Steve joining him, saving Bucky from Hydra, the fighting with the Howling Commandos, Bucky falling from the train. And then Steve tracking Bucky down, bringing him home, helping Bucky to remember everything about their past. That speaks of a depth of love that leaves Tony floundering.</p>\n<p>Plus, what will happen when they break up? Because that\u2019s inevitable, and he\u2019s pretty sure it will destroy him. But then, that\u2019s nothing new. And maybe Clint\u2019s right. He should be trying to hold onto this with both hands and not question it too deeply, so that when Steve and Bucky ultimately come to their senses and decide they don\u2019t want him anymore, he\u2019ll at least have some memories. </p>\n<p>Sometime around 3am, he\u2019s aware of Clint climbing out of the bed. Tony\u2019s left shivering until Bruce joins him, sitting up with a thick book and reading by the light of the reactor. Come morning, Bruce changes the bandages on his shoulder and back. He pronounces the stab wounds as healing well, but not well enough for Tony to be up and out of bed yet, much to Tony\u2019s frustration.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s never dealt well with forced bed rest. Howard never believed in resting when you were sick; that was for the weak, and Stark men weren\u2019t weak. Tony can remember at least half a dozen times where, at his father\u2019s insistence, he was sent to school when he was too sick to focus, and the reaction when Jarvis had to bring him back home was never pretty. It got easier after Howard started leaving for his expeditions to find Captain America, but by then Tony was old enough to care about being seen as weak.</p>\n<p>Laying in bed, staring at the ceiling, Tony <i>feels</i> weak. Since Bruce has stepped out of the room, and he decides to seize his chance. If he can make it down to the workshop and initiate black-out mode\u2026 He slowly sits up, grunting at the expected pain that bites through his ribs. He\u2019s dealt with broken and cracked ribs before, though. It\u2019s a hazard of fighting in armor that regularly gets banged around. Most of the time, he doesn\u2019t even bother to tell the rest of the team about them.</p>\n<p>Very carefully, he puts his feet down on the ground and stands, resting more of his weight on his left foot. The rooms spins a little once he\u2019s upright, but not too badly. \u201cWhat\u2019s a guy have to break to get a crutch?\u201d he grumbles under his breath. \u201cJ, make a note. Invent something that works better than a crutch and doesn\u2019t make you look so lame.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes sir,\u201d JARVIS says. \u201cYour blood pressure has fallen and a deep body scan indicates you are in a lot of pain. Might I suggest returning to bed?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, you may not.\u201d Tony grits his teeth as he carefully opens the door. He still has the use of his right arm, since it\u2019s his left arm that\u2019s broken and his left shoulder that was stabbed, but that doesn\u2019t make anything less awkward. He has to lean heavily against the wall on his right as he hobbles out the door, and his leg and back ache with every step, and he\u2019s honestly not sure if he\u2019s got the strength to make it to the elevator, down to the workshop, and then to his chair.</p>\n<p>He\u2019ll never admit to being kind of glad to see Bucky stepping out of the elevator. Bucky\u2019s eyebrows shoot up when he sees Tony. \u201cTony! What the hell are you doing?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWould you believe I just wanted to see the view?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, but I\u2019d believe you were trying to sneak down to your workshop.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou have no proof of that,\u201d Tony says. His legs are trembling with fatigue. He\u2019s about a second away from sliding down the wall \u2013 the floor does look strangely comfortable all of a sudden \u2013 when Bucky scoops him up. He yelps in outraged protest, but Bucky completely ignores him and carries him\u2026 down to the elevator?</p>\n<p>\u201cUmmm\u2026 What are you doing?\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cYou wanted to go down to your workshop, right?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeeeees\u2026\u201d Tony says, dragging the word out as the doors close. \u201cBut normally people like Steve and Bruce would be carrying me in the other direction.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not Steve,\u201d Bucky says simply. \u201cAnd I can tell you miss your workshop and your \u2018bots. I don\u2019t blame you for wanting to check on them. I\u2019ll help you down there, and when you\u2019re finished we can come back up. I\u2019ll even send Bruce a text so he doesn\u2019t come after us.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou are a surprisingly good co-conspirator,\u201d Tony sys, impressed.</p>\n<p>Bucky shrugs. \u201cI\u2019ve had a lot of practice. Steve and I used to have to sneak out from under his Ma\u2019s eye all the time.\u201d</p>\n<p>Tony eyes him speculatively. \u201cWhat if I said I wanted to do some work?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019d say you\u2019re in no condition to work and you\u2019re well aware of that.\u201d The doors open and Bucky steps out, into the workshop. Instantly, the two of them are besieged by beeps and high-pitched whirs. Bucky chuckles and kneels down with a grace Tony can\u2019t help envying, putting Tony within reach of Dummy, Butterfingers and You without setting him down.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey, hey, none of that. I\u2019m fine. I know, I was gone for a long time, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d Tony reaches for them with his good hand; his bad arm is safely shielded between him and Bucky, away from anxious robots, and he wonders if Bucky did that on purpose. He puts the thought out of his mind for now and focuses on reassuring them, stroking gears and listening to the clicks and beeps that, after so many years, somehow sound like speech.</p>\n<p>Dummy lets out an excited whir and is the first to pull back, scooting across the floor towards the coffee pot. Tony won\u2019t be able to drink it \u2013 the medication he\u2019s on forbids the consumption of caffeine and alcohol, even if it weren't garnished with engine oil \u2013 but lets the \u2018bot go. Bucky stands up, no sign of strain whatsoever, and carries him over to the couch set up in a corner of the shop. Tony sits down, feeling tired already, and lets Butterfingers and You crowd around his legs, biting his lip when You gets a little too close and a tread bumps the cast on his leg.</p>\n<p>\u201cHonestly, you\u2019d think no one had been down here to visit you for months. Uncle Rhodey and Aunt Pepper were down here, don\u2019t tell me they weren\u2019t, and they both spoil you rotten,\u201d Tony grumbles, but his tone is affectionate and his hand is gentle. \u201cYou\u2019re all such drama queens, don\u2019t know where you get it from.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI can\u2019t imagine where they could\u2019ve possibly learned that,\u201d says JARVIS dryly.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou shush,\u201d Tony says absently, accepting the cup of coffee from Dummy. It\u2019s piping hot and smells a little like engine oil. </p>\n<p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t recommend you drink that, sir.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWasn\u2019t going to. Dummy, you\u2019ve been told a million times that oil is poisonous to humans,\u201d Tony says, and, when Dummy subsides with a forlorn little beep, feels immediately guilty. \u201cCome on, don\u2019t be like that, I like your coffee better than anyone else\u2019s except when it\u2019s going to kill me \u2013 why are you laughing?\u201d He looks up at Bucky, slightly offended, but the expression on Bucky\u2019s face stops him cold.</p>\n<p>Bucky looks so <i>affectionate</i>. Tony\u2019s only ever seen that look directed at Steve. And right now it\u2019s focused on him. The warmth in Bucky\u2019s blue eyes is enough to leave Tony speechless, especially when Bucky smiles at him and says, \u201cYou\u2019re adorable.\u201d</p>\n<p>Tony makes a sputtering sound at that.</p>\n<p>\u201cI know Steve and I kind of sprung this on you,\u201d Bucky adds, sitting down beside him, leaving bare centimeters between them. \u201cAnd I\u2019m sorry. I might not know much about how dating goes now, but I\u2019m guessing that making someone think you hate them isn\u2019t the best method. If it helps, I never hated you, Tony.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cEveryone hates me at one point or another.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCan\u2019t vouch for everyone else, but I didn\u2019t. Course, I didn\u2019t understand much of anything at first. But you helped me feel safe. You were the first person completely unrelated to my past that I felt even a little comfortable with. I knew Natasha and Steve before I ended up here; I didn\u2019t know you. But you still took me in and fought off the WSTC and SHIELD, even if it was just for Steve\u2019s sake. You fixed my arm.\u201d He flexes the arm in question, and the lack of noise from the mechanics within is still a beautiful thing.</p>\n<p>\u201cI just don\u2019t\u2026\u201d Tony exhales and sets the cup of coffee down on the floor, frustrated at how hard it is to string the right words together. \u201cYou and Steve, I mean\u2026 it\u2019s <i>you</i> and <i>Steve</i>. I don\u2019t want to push myself in there. You guys are like\u2026 <i>you</i>\u2026 and I\u2019m just \u2013\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAdorable?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cStop saying that!\u201d</p>\n<p>Bucky smirks. \u201cThen stop being adorable.\u201d</p>\n<p>Tony glares at him. \u201cCan you be serious for like two seconds? I can\u2019t say this to Steve because he\u2019ll either get offended and dig his heels in, or he\u2019ll get upset and give me the puppy eyes.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat exactly is it that you\u2019re trying to say?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t want your pity,\u201d Tony says, slowly and clearly. \u201cIf that\u2019s what this is about, I don\u2019t need it.\u201d He can\u2019t bring himself to look at Bucky. Instead, he stares at Dummy. \u201cI\u2019ve had Steve\u2019s name since I was eight years old. I\u2019ve had yours for over two years. I never once thought anything would come of that. I made my peace with having soulmates who didn\u2019t want me a long time ago. So if this is just you two feeling guilty because I got myself kidnapped, then I\u2019d rather we just forget the whole thing.\u201d</p>\n<p>Bucky\u2019s quiet for about twenty seconds. Then he says, \u201cI honestly don\u2019t know what part of that to address first, so let me start by saying you\u2019re an idiot but you\u2019re right, you shouldn\u2019t say that to Steve because you will probably make him cry.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBucky \u2013\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNope, you had your chance, my turn now. This isn\u2019t about <i>pity</i>, Tony. I get that maybe you think Steve is enough of a martyr to date someone just because he feels guilty, but me? I am not that kind of person. If I want to date you, it\u2019s because I love you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Tony chokes on his own saliva. \u201cYou \u2013 you <i>what</i>?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI love you,\u201d Bucky says again, too calm and too serious, and oh god Tony might be having a heart attack. \u201cI\u2019m sorry that Steve and I didn\u2019t say anything sooner. I can understand why you didn\u2019t. We should\u2019ve approached you before all this, but we didn\u2019t. And I can sit here and apologize a hundred times if you want me to, but somehow I don\u2019t think that\u2019s gonna make much of a difference. Hey.\u201d </p>\n<p>He catches Tony\u2019s chin and pulls his head up so that their eyes meet. The sincerity is practically radiating from him. \u201cThis isn\u2019t about guilt, either, so get that idea out of your damn head. There is no expiration date on this relationship. We\u2019re not going to decide, six months down the road, that we\u2019ve lived out our sentence or done our good deed and that means we can dump you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say that,\u201d Tony says, flushing.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, but I can tell you were thinkin\u2019 it. Look, I know that soulmates don\u2019t always work out. But I wanted you long before I knew you had my name. And I\u2019ll still want you even if that disappeared tomorrow. If you can say the same thing to me and Steve, I really don\u2019t think we have a problem here.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI think I\u2019m having a heart attack.\u201d That\u2019s the only thing Tony can think of to say. It would certainly explain why his heart is racing so hard he feels dizzy.</p>\n<p>This time, Bucky\u2019s smirk tips into dangerous territory. \u201cI\u2019ve swept a lot of dames and fellas off their feet in my time, but I\u2019m pretty sure that\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve ever gotten such a\u2026 visceral reaction.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThis is such a bad idea,\u201d Tony says, but he can\u2019t stop himself from grabbing Bucky\u2019s collar and kissing him. He\u2019s half-expecting Bucky to turn the kiss into something frenzied, but \u2013 though Bucky\u2019s free hand immediately comes up to cup the back of Tony\u2019s head \u2013 the kiss stays gentle, slow, and passionate. And good. Really good. Either Bucky\u2019s a natural, or he and Steve have been practicing a lot.</p>\n<p>The mental images of that practice are really, really attractive. Tony makes a tiny, bitten-off sound and tips his head to the side, head swimming. He\u2019s probably not healed enough for this, even though he desperately wants to be. Wants Bucky to crawl on top of him so they can rut together, or so he could suck Bucky off, or do at least one of the numerous things that are running through his mind right now. He doesn\u2019t even realize he\u2019s clinging to Bucky until Bucky shifts closer and hugs him.</p>\n<p>\u201cNot going anywhere, kotyonok,\u201d Bucky whispers, running a soothing hand down his back. \u201cAnd you\u2019re wrong, it\u2019s not a bad idea at all.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPress is gonna have a field day.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIf there\u2019s one thing I\u2019ve learned about the future, it\u2019s that the press is always buzzing about something. Might as well give them something to talk about.\u201d</p>\n<p>Tony huffs a laugh, sinking further into the warmth of Bucky\u2019s arms. \u201cThey\u2019re gonna destroy Steve\u2019s reputation.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s a big boy. I think he can handle it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou said it yourself. You two have such a history.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, we do. But just \u2018cause something worked in the past doesn\u2019t mean it can\u2019t be changed or improved. Sometimes I think Steve and I know each other <i>too</i> well\u2026 and regardless, our history hasn\u2019t changed the way we feel about you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2026We?\u201d</p>\n<p>Bucky presses a kiss to the top of his head. \u201cI\u2019ll let Steve say it for himself, but I love you, Tony.\u201d</p>\n<p>Every time Bucky says that, Tony feels a shiver all the way down into his core, and it gets a little harder to breathe. Because he almost believes it. Because those words are chipping away at the part of him that\u2019s filled with insecurities and self-doubts. And he really does not know what to do about that. He closes his eyes, absorbing the feel of Bucky hugging him, letting himself indulge in something he never thought he\u2019d have, and doesn\u2019t even remember dozing off.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s vaguely aware of Bucky picking him up and carrying him out of the workshop. Then he\u2019s set back down in his bed, and Bucky whispers something in Russian and kisses him again. Pepper says something, Bucky answers her, and then the door shuts. Somewhere in between awake and asleep, Tony opens his eyes and sees Pepper watching him. She\u2019s smiling, though her eyes are too bright.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe loves me, Pep,\u201d Tony whispers, still not sure he believes it all the way yet, but awed nevertheless.</p>\n<p>She smiles a little wider and touches his cheek. \u201cYeah, they do.\u201d</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>\u201cBut I\u2019m telling you, they might need my help!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAgent Coulson instructed me not to let you out of your room, sir.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou take orders from <i>him</i>, now?\u201d</p>\n<p>The outraged sound of Tony\u2019s voice is enough to make Steve grin as he reaches for the doorknob. It gives easily under his hand and he steps inside of Tony\u2019s room. Tony stops complaining mid-sentence, head snapping around to stare very intently at Steve. It\u2019s only been a week since he came home from the hospital, but it\u2019s been hell keeping him in bed long enough to heal. Frankly, Steve spent the whole battle half-expecting Iron Man to show up to help out Thor and Iron Patriot. </p>\n<p>\u201cThank god,\u201d Pepper says, breaking the silence with a relieved sigh. \u201cIf you\u2019d taken any longer, you were going to come back to a corpse. I\u2019ve never heard so much whining in my life.\u201d </p>\n<p>Steve raises an eyebrow, holding back a laugh. No wonder Coulson gave him permission to skip the debrief. \u201cThanks for baby-sitting, Pepper.\u201d</p>\n<p>Tony\u2019s sqawk of \u201cI don\u2019t need a baby-sitter!\u201d goes ignored by the both of them. Steve feels like he and Pepper have come to an understanding of sorts, one borne from a few too many hours spent sitting beside the bed of an unconscious Tony. She\u2019ll happily murder him if he does anything wrong to Tony, and Steve is going to do his damndest to make sure that never happens. Not just because he loves Tony, but because it would be a real shame if Pepper\u2019s very expensive suit and shoes got blood on them.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019d say anytime, but honestly you\u2019re worse than an afternoon of paperwork,\u201d Pepper says, taking the sting out of her words by ruffling Tony\u2019s hair playfully. Then she gives him a kiss on the cheek. \u201cI\u2019m going now so that Steve can give you all the first-hand dirty details I\u2019m not supposed to know about, but don\u2019t forget. Rhodey and I are coming over for supper this Friday night. And I won\u2019t be very happy if I have to start our night by dragging you out of your lab.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll remember,\u201d Tony promises.</p>\n<p>\u201cSee that you do. Steve.\u201d Pepper nods at him as she walks out, and Steve nods back to her before taking her place beside Tony. He\u2019s tired from the battle, and it feels good to sit. For something that only lasted for half a day, it was very intense.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo what happened?\u201d Tony says, watching Steve closely.</p>\n<p>Steve pushes his cowl up. \u201cRichards was experimenting again.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat fucker. I know you said we have to play nice, but he really deserves a punch in the face.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m getting to the point where I\u2019m not going to argue. From what I saw when I left, though, his wife was giving him a pretty hard time.\u201d</p>\n<p>Tony\u2019s annoyed expression softens just a little. They all like Sue Richards, who is excellent at paving over her husband\u2019s indiscretions. \u201cGood. I hope that someday she finds someone who is actually worth her time. She spends her whole life cleaning up after Richards, and he never appreciates it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell,\u201d Steve says slowly, \u201cMaybe someday Richards will open his eyes and realize what he has. And how lucky he is to have it.\u201d He looks at Tony meaningfully and watches Tony\u2019s rant die before it ever really begins. </p>\n<p>\u201cYou, uh, sure you\u2019re not reading too much into the situation?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cActually, I think I\u2019m reading just enough.\u201d Steve pulls his gloves off, then takes Tony\u2019s hand. After hours of holding a limp hand, he can\u2019t express how nice it is to have Tony\u2019s fingers wrapping securely around his. \u201cAlthough I have to say, even when I first came here and we bickered all the time, I never once thought you were as irritating as Reed Richards is.\u201d</p>\n<p>Tony barks out a laugh. \u201cGood to hear I never hit the gold standard of irritating,\u201d he says, looking down at their hands. \u201cI\u2019m guessing you talked to Bucky.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, I did. And I should\u2019ve come talk to you right away, but I thought you might want some time to process. And I wanted to talk to you alone, without one of the others in the room.\u201d Which has been all but impossible. Tony must be assured of the team\u2019s affection for him by now, because there\u2019s always at least one person hanging out in his room when Steve comes by.</p>\n<p>\u201cNever thought Captain America would have stage fright.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t. I do. Tony,\u201d and Steve\u2019s dreamed of saying these words, but that doesn\u2019t make it any less frightening to say; he has to steel himself to get it out. \u201cI love you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Tony actually shivers. \u201cJesus,\u201d he says, a little shaky. \u201cYou and Bucky are scary alike sometimes.\u201d</p>\n<p>Steve smirks. \u201cGuess we are. He told me what you said, about the \u2013 the pity and feeling guilty, and Tony, I swear to you that has nothing to do with any of this. I\u2019ve been attracted to you since the day we met. It\u2019s part of the reason why I lashed out so much at first. I wasn\u2019t ready to feel like that way for anyone but Bucky, and the fact that it was you and you already had Pepper just made it a hell of a lot of worse.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI didn\u2019t want you to. I spent a long time hiding this, Tony. Even from Bucky at first. If I\u2019d known what you were thinking \u2013\u201d Steve stops himself. He\u2019s been down this road, beating himself up, hundreds of times now. Bucky\u2019s right. It doesn\u2019t help, and it doesn\u2019t change the past. </p>\n<p>\u201cI didn\u2019t want you to know either,\u201d Tony says, filling in the gap. \u201cThis isn\u2019t all on you guys. I could\u2019ve said something at any point over the past four years. Pepper and I broke up before Bucky came to the tower, remember? There was plenty of opportunity.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Steve says softly, even though it\u2019s not the same thing. Not by a long shot. If he and Bucky weren\u2019t dating, there\u2019s a slight chance Tony might have approached one of them \u2013 but even that is unlikely. With the two of them already in a very solid relationship? Tony might pretend to be full of it for the paparazzi, but no one is that confident. And Steve and Bucky should\u2019ve realized that. </p>\n<p>\u201cSo anyway, you, um, I know you said Bucky told you and it\u2019s not about pity or feeling guilty, but \u2013 Steve, there wouldn\u2019t be any hard feelings. We could still be friends and teammates. Just because you have someone\u2019s name doesn\u2019t mean you <i>have</i> to date them. You know that, right? It means we\u2019re really good matches, but sometimes that\u2026 that doesn\u2019t mean much. So I just \u2013 you should know, I\u2019d understand if you guys didn\u2019t want to date me. I know it\u2019s going to be a lot \u2013 the press is gonna go crazy, they\u2019ll drag your reputation through the mud, and you guys have so much history... and this, this would be <i>it</i> for me, I\u2019d rather we forget the whole thing if you don\u2019t really want it.\u201d</p>\n<p>It just about kills Steve to stay quiet through the whole thing. He wants so badly to lunge forward and kiss Tony into silence, until Tony gets it, but he restrains himself. He has the feeling Bucky shut this line of thinking down pretty fast, and this seems to be something Tony <i>needs</i> to say. And Steve knows what it\u2019s like to have to keep something like that in. It haunts you. So he bites the inside of his cheek until it bleeds and just listens.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd I\u2019m not a very good boyfriend. You can ask Pepper. I\u2019ll forget about 90% of our dates and I\u2019ll never remember anniversaries or birthdays. There are lots of nights I won\u2019t come to bed, and I cling like an octopus when I do, and I have nightmares.\u201d Tony pauses, licking his lips, his gaze far away. \u201cAnd I\u2019m an asshole, Steve, you know that. I\u2019m sarcastic and mouthy and I never say things right \u2013 shit, I\u2019m amazed this is coming out the way it\u2019s supposed to. I push people away and I throw money at all my problems and I don\u2019t like fighting, but I provoke fights all the fucking time and Captain America really should not be dating me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Tony\u2019s eyes flick up briefly to meet Steve\u2019s, then skitter away as soon as he realizes Steve is watching him. His voice is a lot softer when he finishes with, \u201cAnd you and Bucky, you guys have the fairy tale, and I don\u2019t want to fuck it up. If you\u2019re gonna try polyamory, it should be with someone who deserves it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you finished?\u201d Steve asks when it seems like nothing more is forthcoming, and when Tony nods, uncharacteristically meek, Steve exhales slowly. \u201cTony, you are a lot of things. I won\u2019t deny you\u2019re an asshole sometimes. But you\u2019re forgetting that Buck and I can be assholes too. No relationship is ever <i>easy</i>. They all require work. Sometimes that work involves telling JARVIS to remind you about birthdays and anniversaries. Sometimes it means physically pulling you out of your lab \u2013 which is something I am already intimately familiar with doing, I\u2019m sure you remember.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSomeday I am going to override your access code,\u201d Tony grumbles, though without heat.</p>\n<p>Steve just smiled. \u201cSure you will. I\u2019ve never cared about my reputation, and the press can say what they want. I didn\u2019t care when it came to Bucky, and I don\u2019t care when it comes to you. And Bucky and I might have lots of history, but so do you and I. We\u2019ve been friends for four years now. Unless\u2026\u201d He trails off, suddenly hesitant. \u201cTony, if this is your way of trying to make up an excuse so you don\u2019t have to date me and Bucky \u2013\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo! God no,\u201d Tony says quickly. \u201cI want to. I \u2013 jesus, Steve, have you ever looked in a mirror? There\u2019s a reason why the female photographers always gravitate towards you two.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t try to pretend you don\u2019t know you\u2019re just as attractive,\u201d Steve says fondly. There\u2019s been more than one moment when watching Tony take the armor off, leaving him in just that scrap of an under-suit he frequently wears underneath, has left Steve achingly hard. Tony might be shorter than him and Bucky by a good foot, but his body is well muscled after years in the workshop. </p>\n<p>\u201cIf you think I\u2019m attractive, why don\u2019t you come over here and prove it?\u201d</p>\n<p>The words are spoken defiantly, but with a hint of <i>something</i> underneath, and Steve gives in to his initial desire and moves from the chair to the side of the bed. He leans in, savoring those last few seconds of anticipation before his mouth finally meets Tony\u2019s. Tony slips his hand free and grabs the front of Steve\u2019s shirt, like he\u2019s afraid Steve might change his mind and back off. It\u2019s as endearing as it is unfounded, because Steve is immediately addicted to the feel of Tony in his arms.</p>\n<p>\u201cI love you,\u201d Steve says. \u201cAnd we can take this as slow as you want. I\u2019m not promising it\u2019s definitely going to work out. I don\u2019t know that. Neither does Bucky, or you. I wish we did. All we can do is try.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe you\u2019re giving me one of your speeches at a time like this,\u201d Tony mutters, coy little smile on his lips.</p>\n<p>Steve rolls his eyes. \u201cFor the last time, I do not have a list of memorized speeches that I whip out when necessary.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSure you don\u2019t.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t, mostly because you and the rest of the team never cease to surprise me,\u201d Steve says, and he\u2019s being honest there. No list of speeches, never mind just one speech, could possibly cover the wide array of experiences Steve has on a weekly basis. And he loves it that way. </p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re such a sap,\u201d says Tony.</p>\n<p>\u201cI am, but you like it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Tony snorts but doesn\u2019t deny it, instead tentatively leaning up to kiss him, like he\u2019s not sure he has permission to do that yet. Steve kisses him back eagerly and swears he feels the mark on the inside of his arm tingle a little when he does. Which is impossible, of course, but it is possible he\u2019s even more of a sap than he realized. He decides not to say anything to that effect, less he get teased for the rest of eternity, and focuses on kissing his boyfriend instead.</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>Eight weeks later, Bruce cuts off the last cast and deems Tony fully healed. Well, \u2018fully\u2019 as in none of his bones are broken and the stab marks are getting to that shiny stage. As far as Tony is concerned, he\u2019s been healed for the past six weeks and it\u2019s just taken the medical profession a while to catch up. He gives Bruce a one-armed hug in thanks and beelines it out of the room to find his boyfriends. And he should be way past the stage where thinking that word makes him smile like a dumbass, but he\u2019s really, really not.</p>\n<p>Bucky, Steve, Clint and newest member of their team, Sam, are all clustered on the couch together watching television. Clint has a huge bowl of popcorn in his lap that goes flying when Tony makes a running leap and lands right on Bucky\u2019s lap. Bucky yelps in surprise, only to promptly get yanked into the most passionate, thorough kiss Tony has ever participated in. <i>Ever</i>. Steve forgets all about helping to pick up the popcorn in favor of watching with a very interested expression.</p>\n<p>\u201cAw christ, here we go,\u201d Clint complains to no one in particular.</p>\n<p>\u201cDo they do this often?\u201d Sam asks, sounding amused as Tony releases Bucky and turns to Steve, pulling him into an equally passionate kiss. Steve makes a rough sound and cups Tony\u2019s face for a better angle, though makes no move to pull him off Bucky\u2019s lap. Clint groans.</p>\n<p>\u201cMore than you want to know. Come on, I\u2019ll show you the training room. You do not want to be here for the next five minutes when the clothes start coming off.\u201d</p>\n<p>In the wake of Clint fleeing the room, dragging Sam along with him, Tony pulls back and smirks smugly. The whole team thinks they\u2019re fucking already, except for maybe Natasha (who is Bucky\u2019s confidant) and Bruce (who expressly warned all three of them against doing anything before Tony was healed). There\u2019s been a little petting, a lot of making out, but it\u2019s never gone beyond that. It is officially the slowest Tony has ever taken a relationship \u2013 even with Pepper, they were having sex pretty much the night they first kissed - and the surprising thing is, he\u2019s actually enjoying the pace.</p>\n<p>Steve and Bucky don\u2019t need fame; in Bucky\u2019s case, considering that he doesn\u2019t cope well with the media\u2019s more intrusive questions, he has more than he wants. The same goes for money: they both have hefty bank accounts after ninety years of accruing interest. And not even Tony can convince himself that this is because they don\u2019t want him sexually, because he\u2019s seen the arousal in Steve\u2019s face and felt the way Bucky\u2019s fingers grip his hips. They want him. He\u2019s very slowly starting to believe that they want <i>all</i> of him.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou did that on purpose?\u201d Bucky says, winding an arm around Tony\u2019s waist.</p>\n<p>\u201cDuh. Clint\u2019s a popcorn hog.\u201d</p>\n<p>Steve lets out a snort as he bends down to grab the popcorn bowl. It\u2019s still about half full. \u201cYou could\u2019ve just asked someone to make another bowl.\u201d</p>\n<p>Tony shrugs and slings his legs across Steve\u2019s lap. It\u2019s fun to make Clint squirm, mostly because he knows Clint is just being a drama queen and it doesn\u2019t really bother him. \u201cThat\u2019s not as much fun. Besides, I wanted to show you. See? Cast free.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI see that.\u201d Steve shuffles the bowl into Tony\u2019s lap and sets his freed hands on Tony\u2019s leg, pushing up the fabric of Tony\u2019s jeans until he can see the skin underneath. The muscles are slightly atrophied and his whole leg and foot are swollen, and Tony wouldn\u2019t admit it out loud, but his leg hurts from walking on it even a little bit. His arm is sore too, which is why he made sure to land on Bucky and not Steve - so that his sore arm would be outward.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo Bruce gave you a clean bill of health?\u201d Bucky asks.</p>\n<p>\u201cFor the most part. Standard rules apply,\u201d Tony says, selecting a piece of popcorn. Frankly, he\u2019s never listened to medical advice before and he\u2019s not going to start now. </p>\n<p>\u201cWhich I\u2019m guessing means you\u2019re supposed to take it easy.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cBoring. I\u2019m way behind on work. I just came down to \u2013\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHave a nice night in watching movies with your boyfriends? That sounds lovely.\u201d Bucky shifts his weight a little, then pulls Tony down until Tony is sprawled across his chest. </p>\n<p>\u201cNo, that\u2019s not what I \u2013\u201d Tony breaks off again as Steve starts very, very gently massaging his leg. He tenses, expecting it to hurt, and slowly relaxes when it doesn\u2019t. Apparently the serum gave Steve magical hands. He thinks about the work waiting for him in the workshop. It\u2019s only been in the last month that Bruce has cleared him to do anything physical, and he wasn\u2019t lying when he said he was way behind.</p>\n<p>But Bucky is warm and comfortable, and Steve\u2019s hands feel so nice. He leans his head against Bucky\u2019s shoulder. \u201cMaybe I can stay for a little while. One movie.\u201d</p>\n<p>Steve grins down at his hands. \u201cJust one? We were gonna order pizza.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t push your luck,\u201d Tony says fondly, but he has the feeling he won\u2019t be moving anytime soon. Especially if Clint finds the courage to bring Sam back and join them. Then Natasha and Coulson will inevitably wander in, and sooner or later Bruce, Thor, Jane and Darcy will follow. There\u2019s a strong possibility Pepper and Rhodey might even show up. It wouldn\u2019t be the first time, and the local pizza place is actually starting to get used to orders of over thirty pizzas \u2013 they don\u2019t even ask if it\u2019s a crank call anymore.</p>\n<p>He relaxes a little more and turns to look at the television as Bucky\u2019s free hand idly rubs up and down his sore arm. For this, his work can wait one more day.</p>"
