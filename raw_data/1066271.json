  "text": "<p dir=\"ltr\">\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cUgh,\u201d Stiles says as he flops face first onto the couch and buries his head in the giant fluffy pillow Lydia insisted on buying.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Speaking of Lydia, he can almost hear her rolling her eyes at him from across the room. It\u2019s a special skill she has.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cOnly you could be so gloomy after getting laid,\u201d she says, and whoa, that is definitely her judgy voice. He hates it when her judgy voice is directed at him, which happens more often than he\u2019d like. Don\u2019t get him wrong, Lydia\u2019s ability to judge essentially everything everyone does is kind of terrifyingly hot, but only when her judgmental looks aren\u2019t directed at him. It always makes him feel like he\u2019s fifteen and gangly and awkward again, back before they became friends and she had every reason to look down on him.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cStop judging me,\u201d he whines. \u201cYou don\u2019t understand my pain.\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cSince I know you\u2019re not talking about the literal pain resulting from taking it up your back door, the answer is no.\u201d Lydia swats him over the head with another throw pillow. \u201cThe day you stop being a drama queen may be the day I\u2019ll stop judging you. Until then, I think it\u2019s my duty as one of your best friends to tell you when you\u2019re being ridiculous.\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cI\u2019m not being ridiculous. I\u2019m disillusioned and experiencing a crisis. It\u2019s your duty to support me and let me cry into a few bottles of wine and a bucket of ice cream, not make me feel even worse.\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cIt can\u2019t have been that bad,\u201d Lydia reasons somewhat incredulously. Understandably so; he was out for hours last night, in a hot dude\u2019s bed, doing decidedly x-rated things. For all intents and purposes, he should be glowing, not glowering.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Stiles sighs and twists around on the couch, so he\u2019s lying half on his side, half on his back, and tucks his legs closer to his body to make room for Lydia. \u201cIt was, though. Well, no, it wasn\u2019t bad, exactly,\u201d he relents, \u201cit just wasn\u2019t-\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cSatisfactory? Mind-blowing? What you were looking for?\u201d Lydia offers.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cAll of the above.\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cStiles.\u201d Lydia sighs and pats his leg, the way she always does when she\u2019s going to hit him with a sympathetic but stern lecture. \u201cNot every time you have sex is going to be equally good for you, especially with one night stands. It takes time for people to get used to each other\u2019s bodies, to get attuned to one another. Sometimes you hit a jackpot - more often, you don\u2019t. And don\u2019t get me wrong, it\u2019s not a bad thing, but you seem to be one of the people who are extremely hard to satisfy.\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cMe?\u201d Stiles scoffs. \u201cAre you kidding me? I\u2019m easy. I\u2019m so fucking easy, and it really doesn\u2019t take much to get me off.\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cThat\u2019s not what I was talking about and you know it.\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">And strangely enough, he does. The thing is, Stiles likes sex. He likes sex a lot, and therefore he\u2019s been having as much sex as he could get. And it\u2019s usually good, and he always gets off, it\u2019s just...not enough. It leaves him feeling coiled up under his skin and sort of empty.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cLook, I\u2019m not trying to butt into your personal life and tell you what to do here, Stiles, but you\u2019re the kind of guy who gets very attached and commits. Are you sure one night stands are the way to go for you?\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Stiles almost scoffs at her concern, because the great Lydia Martin got it exactly the wrong way around. \u201cI don\u2019t want slow, gentle feeling sex with candlelight, Lydia,\u201d he says. \u201cActually, that\u2019s the opposite of what I want.\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Lydia raises one perfectly plucked eyebrow. \u201cThen what do you want?\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Stiles bites his lips. It\u2019s not that he\u2019s ashamed of his kinks; he\u2019s a big supporter of accepting everyone and everything and letting people do their thing. It\u2019s not even a particularly weird or unusual fantasy, it\u2019s just that he doesn\u2019t usually talk about his bedroom preferences with anyone, not even with Scott. As it turns out, it\u2019s kind of uncomfortable to hear about stuff that makes you picture your best friend doing the dirty in several different positions, so for the sake of their sanity, they\u2019ve stopped giving each other the details.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">But this is Lydia, not Scott, and he doubts he can say anything that could possibly shock her. \u201cI just...I just want someone to fuck me,\u201d he blurts out, flailing his hands around. \u201cI mean, like, really fuck me. Not any of this wishy-washy stuff, but someone with strength and stamina who\u2019ll actually, honestly, fuck me, hold me down and fuck me so hard I can still feel it the next day.\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cSo, essentially, you want a werewolf,\u201d Lydia deduces, cool as a cucumber, more interested in inspecting her nails than dealing with Stiles\u2019 drama. It\u2019s strangely reassuring that she pretends she isn\u2019t giving him her full attention; it tells him that she doesn\u2019t think he\u2019s weird for wanting to be dominated.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The solution she offers is way too simplistic, though. It doesn\u2019t work like that.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">She must sense his scepticism, because she turns towards him again. \u201cWhat?\u201d she asks. \u201cWerewolves are insanely good looking, they\u2019re stronger than humans, they have more stamina and from my experience, they generally enjoy being on top and getting a little rough. You find yourself a werewolf who\u2019s willing to fuck you, you\u2019ll have a greater chance of getting what you want than with any run-off-the-mill guy you meet in a bar. Get it out of your system for a while so you can enjoy sex more in general, then go back when you need a hard fuck again.\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cIsn\u2019t that speciest?\u201d Stiles wonders.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Lydia\u2019s ten billion times less prejudiced than the rest of their society, but Stiles is different. He\u2019s never really seen the difference between werewolves and humans. Well, no, he has noticed differences, obviously, what with his best friend being a werewolf and everything, but he doesn\u2019t differentiate, and he doesn\u2019t think humans are better than werewolves. Most people would be appalled by Lydia\u2019s suggestion; all those who consider werewolves to be nothing better than animals, all those who\u2019re afraid of them, all those who\u2019re already looking down on Stiles for associating with werewolves. \u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Then, of course, there\u2019s the other part of the population who pretend they hate werewolves but secretly get off on fucking them, using them to boost their ego, feeling safe and invincible in the knowledge that the Werewolf Control Act prevents the werewolves from hurting them. Stiles knows from what his father tells him that there\u2019s also plenty of workplace harassment going on that the werewolves can\u2019t really fight against. As if it doesn\u2019t suck enough that hardly anyone is willing to give them a job in the first place, regardless of how smart and qualified and competent they are.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">It just\u2026.it just sucks, and the thought of sleeping with a werewolf makes Stiles\u2019 stomach clench uncomfortably. Not because he\u2019d be adverse to it, fuck no, but the thought of using someone like this and then drop them like a hot potato leaves a bitter taste in his mouth. Obviously, that\u2019s exactly what he does with all his one night stands, but that\u2019s different. Werewolves are being exploited enough as it is.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">But fuck if the thought doesn\u2019t turn him on.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Lydia flicks her hair over her shoulder. \u201cI\u2019m listing their assets, and I speak from experience. Talk about stereotypes all you want, some of them are true. If you don\u2019t want to do it, fine with me, but don\u2019t come running later to cry on my shoulder. Either take my advice or leave it.\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cWhere would I even find a werewolf willing to fuck a human?\u201d Stiles demurs. Werewolves mostly keep to themselves. Stiles doesn\u2019t blame them.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cOh for Christ\u2019s sake.\u201d Lydia levels him with a hard look. \u201cYou find them where you find everyone you can purchase the fulfillment of your every sexual fantasy from. Find a damn hooker.\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Stiles nearly falls off the couch.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n<strong>\u221e</strong>\n</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Derek exhales slowly and watches the steamy cloud dissolve slowly into the night air, trying to ignore the cold that emanates from the stone wall he\u2019s leaning against and seeps through his leather jacket. He doesn\u2019t mind the cold, usually, isn\u2019t as susceptible to it as humans, but it\u2019s freezing cold and the weather report said it would start snowing during the night, so a warm coat wouldn\u2019t go amiss. Or some gloves, at the very least. Turns out stuffing his hands into the cuffs of his jackets doesn\u2019t actually do much to keep them warm.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">He glares at the alley leading to the back entrance of the shady building he usually picks his customer up at. The guy he\u2019s sharing his spot with dragged his john into the dark shadows about ten minutes ago because you can give more blowjobs in a row if you don\u2019t bother to go to a hotel room, as he\u2019d announced cheerfully, and now the unmistakable and enthusiastic sounds of people having sex reach his ears and grate on his nerves.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Derek needs to get away from here. Not only because he needs to get out of the cold before he freezes to the ground, but also because he seriously needs a paying customer if he wants to pay the rent in time. And, well, also because he feels like punching a hole into the brick wall on the small chance that it reminds the others to be a little quieter.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The moans increase in pitch and frequency, become so loud that he almost misses the quick, skip-race heartbeat steadily drawing closer. Nervous, Derek thinks. Twitchy. A first timer. Not his usual clientele, but he can make do. Probably.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">He\u2019s better standing in dark corners and looking broody. It attracts the kind of men who get off on the thought that he\u2019s dangerous, could rip them apart with a single blow. The kind of men who boost their egos thinking they\u2019re taming a wild beast. Derek hates them, hates their taunting and their proclivity for showing off, but they pay good money and he doesn\u2019t need to play a role. Doesn\u2019t really have to pretend he likes it, doesn\u2019t have to play nice and sweet.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">He once smiled at a younger man, obviously a virgin, and the boy broke out in cold sweat and ran the other way. The guy he shares his corner with (he\u2019s never bothered to learn his name, and the guy hasn\u2019t offered) had laughed at him for five minutes, taken the man by the hand and led him away. He looks gentle and trustworthy, scores a lot with johns who like to pretend to be brave by fucking werewolves but are secretly scared of them, looking for the most harmless looking one.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">His colleague has a lot more clients than Derek does.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Derek can\u2019t afford to let this one get away. He knows how he looks, knows it\u2019s attractive to most people who come looking for a quick fuck. He\u2019ll just have to let that work in his favour more, be a little less menacing, maybe. Which is easier said than done.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">About half a minute later, he sees the guy with the stuttering heartbeat round the corner. It\u2019s definitely not his usual kind of customer; he\u2019s tall and lanky, his hair is sticking up in all directions as if he\u2019d just stuck his finger into a power outlet, and he\u2019s wearing loose-fitted jeans and plaid. A student, most likely, not the arrogant, self-assured businessman who usually comes around here searching for a quick fuck. The nervous energy the guy exudes is enough to make Derek feel twitchy, too, though not necessarily in a bad way. The man is attractive, has nice eyes and an obscene mouth that makes Derek want to find out what sounds he can draw from it.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">He pushes himself away from the wall and saunters into the light before speaking. He\u2019s learnt the hard way that lurking in corners may be alluring for some, but scares away most people. \u201cLooking for company?\u201d he asks, refrains from adding a cheesy pick-up line. They never work for him anyway.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The young man startles a little, still, flails as he regains his balance. \u201cWhoa.\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Derek can\u2019t help but raise an eyebrow. \u201cYou okay?\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Funnily enough, that seems to do it. The man\u2019s heartbeat spikes, and the heavy scent of arousal fills the air around him, the faint traces of anxiety and fear disappearing completely. \u201cYeah,\u201d he breathes, \u201cjust -\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cNever done this before?\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The man grimaces. \u201cIs it that obvious?\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cYeah.\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cAwesome.\u201d He sighs and tilts his head back to look at the sky. \u201cLeave it to me to embarrass myself in front of every living creature in the world.\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Derek forces himself to not look at the exposed skin of his neck. \u201cI don\u2019t mind.\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cYou don\u2019t mind that I embarrass myself or that this is my first time picking up a hooker?\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Derek smirks. \u201cEither. Both. I don\u2019t have a policy against letting awkward virgins fuck me.\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cExcuse me, I\u2019m not a virgin,\u201d the man says, affronted. \u201cI\u2019m just new to the whole prostitution thing.\u201d He gestures around wildly and then draws in a deep breath. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t want to fuck you.\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Derek bites his tongue. Shit. Of course he\u2019s fucked up again. He should never be allowed to open his fucking mouth if he ends up driving everyone away. He might as well just walk away now and try to find a different customer. Or maybe just call it a night, what with the shitty luck he's had today. Maybe invest some money he doesn\u2019t have into a How To Talk To People 101 so he can get rid of his habit of accidentally insulting potential paying customers.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cI want you to fuck me.\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The words are so quiet, stumbling out of the man\u2019s mouth, that he almost misses them. He snaps his head up. \u201cWhat?\u201d he asks.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cI said,\u201d the man continues, clears his throat weakly, \u201cI want you to fuck me.\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Derek maybe loses control over his jaw a little.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cIs that\u2026.is that gonna be a problem?\u201d He starts twitching nervously again, scratches his chin and rakes his fingers through his hair like he\u2019s suddenly ashamed of asking. \u201cI mean, do you not -\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cNo,\u201d Derek says quickly, voice much more raw and shaky than he intends it to be. \u201cI mean yes,\u201d he corrects himself when the man\u2019s face falls. \u201cI mean, it\u2019s not a problem. It just took me by surprise, is all. That\u2019s not what people usually ask for.\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cOh.\u201d He breathes a sigh in relief. Then his gaze turns decidedly curious. \u201cWhat do they usually ask for?\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cTo fuck me,\u201d Derek says bluntly. There\u2019s no point in beating around the bush. Interestingly enough, while it does spark the man\u2019s interest, it\u2019s nothing compared to the wave of arousal that hit him earlier when they talked about Derek fucking him.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cRight.\u201d He nods. \u201cBut it\u2019s not gonna -\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cI already said it wasn\u2019t a problem,\u201d Derek interrupts him. Luckily, he really doesn\u2019t think it will be. When he\u2019s getting fucked, it doesn\u2019t matter much whether he is enjoying it or not. It\u2019s different when he\u2019s on top, obviously. That hasn\u2019t happened very often, and only ever with women, but they hardly ever find their way into these districts. Women who pay for sex frequent different circles, search more respectable and safe ways to get what they want. Derek normally avoids the ones that do look for hookers on the streets; they\u2019re not necessarily nicer than the men he deals with on a daily basis, and faking it is much harder. He\u2019s tired of imagining other people below him just to be able to give them what they want; the effort isn\u2019t worth it.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">He doesn\u2019t think he\u2019ll have to fake it with this guy. He\u2019s attractive enough, he doesn\u2019t seem like a douchebag, and he smells really fucking good. Fucking him won\u2019t be a hardship. He may just have hit a jackpot, if he\u2019s not dealing with a broke college student.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cCan you pay?\u201d he asks.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cI - yeah, good thinking. I should probably ask how much.\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Derek is tempted to give a sum higher than he usually does, but whatever the guy does for a living, it certainly hasn\u2019t made him rich, and the regular money is better than nothing. So he actually cuts it down by ten quid, and the man nods.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cYeah, okay. That\u2019s - uhm\u2026.sorry, I don\u2019t know how to do this. Which you already know. So...where do we do this? Oh, I\u2019m Stiles by the way.\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">He actually extends his hand for Derek to shake. Derek gives him a look that hopefully doesn\u2019t say \u2018you\u2019re the weirdest person I\u2019ve ever met\u2019 and, after a moment of hesitation, takes it. \u201cDerek,\u201d he says.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cIs that a fake name?\u201d Stiles frowns a little, worries his lip with his teeth.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cYou ask me that?\u201d Derek snorts. \u201cStiles?\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cThat actually is my name, though.\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">There\u2019s no uptick in his heartbeat, no sign that he\u2019s lying. Derek nods. \u201cDerek is my real name, too.\u201d He turns and points further down the street. \u201cThere\u2019s a little motel about two blocks from here. Nothing fancy but fairly clean, they don\u2019t ask questions and don\u2019t mind renting rooms by the hour.\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cWell then,\u201d Stiles says, shoving his hands into his pockets, \u201clead the way?\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Derek does. It\u2019s not until they\u2019ve checked into the motel and closed the door behind them that they speak again.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cOkay,\u201d Stiles says. \u201cI think we should probably lay down some ground rules. No scratching and biting that draws blood. I mean, that should be obvious.\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cYes,\u201d Derek says drily. \u201cSince I don\u2019t intent to go to jail, that\u2019s a given.\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cRight. But other than that, I don\u2019t really mind if you get a little rough.\u201d He draws himself up to stand a little taller, a little more determined. \u201cActually, I want you to get rough. I\u2019m not super into spanking, and I do want to be still able to walk out of here after, but I really just want you to fuck me hard. Don\u2019t treat me as if I\u2019m gonna break. Can you do that?\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Derek swallows down the lump in his throat. \u201cYes, I can definitely do that.\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Stiles grins. \u201cAnything you wanna add? Like, stuff I shouldn\u2019t do, no kissing -\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cThis isn\u2019t Pretty Woman, Stiles.\u201d Derek rolls his eyes, grabs him by the arm and yanks him forward until his body is pressed flush against Derek\u2019s.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cShame, I\u2019d love to have as much money as the dude Richard Gere plays in that mo-hng,\u201d Stiles\u2019 words are swallowed by Derek\u2019s lips and quickly turn into a shameless moan. Stiles is young and eager, and incredibly responsive to even the slightest touches, and that makes it all that much easier. When his lips fall open Derek takes the opportunity to lick into his mouth and run his tongue along his teeth, lets himself enjoy the warm-slick slide of tongues against each other.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Stiles\u2019 hands are already tugging determinedly at his leather jacket and Derek draws back a little to shrug it off and throw it across the room, kicking his shoes off at the same time. When he straightens again, Stiles has already gotten rid of his jacket as well and is making grabby hands at Derek.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Derek snorts at the childish behaviour. \u201cYou\u2019re ridiculous, you know that?\u201d he asks, pulling his henley over his head as he speaks.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cI\u2019d scold you for talking to your client like that, but I think you make up for it with that torso, I mean, holy shit,\u201d Stiles says, licking his lips and staring at his abs.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Derek grins, kisses him again and walks forward. Stiles moves with him until his knees hit the edge of the bed, and then it only takes a little push for him to fall backwards onto the covers. Derek makes quick work of Stiles\u2019 shoes before following him onto the bed and covering his lithe body with his own. Stiles takes it as a blanket permission to get his hands and his mouth all over the parts of Derek\u2019s body he can reach, fingers digging into his skin as Derek grinds his hips down. Derek shoves his hands under his shirts, urges Stiles to take them off because really, he\u2019s still wearing too many layers, and when the clothes have finally fallen uselessly to the ground he does what he\u2019s wanted to do since Stiles first came up to him, gets his mouth on the pale flesh of Stiles\u2019 neck and bites down with blunt teeth, sucks at the skin until a dark bruise begins to form.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Stiles stiffens minutely under him, and for a second Derek fears he\u2019s gone too far, but then he lets out a shaky moan and arches underneath him, his hands sneaking down to the fly of Derek\u2019s jeans and fumbling with the button. \u201cFuck,\u201d he swears, \u201cfuck, Derek, off, take them off.\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Derek\u2019s hands are shaking a little, too, when he pushes off his jeans and then Stiles\u2019. Undressing, he thinks idly, is that much easier when you\u2019re calm and composed and not actually into what\u2019s happening. But he is, very much so. It\u2019s been a long time since he had sex with someone he enjoyed it with, but his body remembers the steps, burns up under the trail Stiles\u2019 hands leave on him. It helps that Stiles is into it, too, unabashedly; it\u2019s almost more of a turn on than his touch is.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The slide of their erections against each other makes Stiles actually mewl. \u201cFuck, Derek, I need you to fuck me, like, right now.\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cNot quite yet,\u201d Derek says lowly and flips him over.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cNonono, this is the opposite of what I - holy shit,\u201d Stiles cries out as Derek licks a wet stripe over his hole. \u201cOh my God.\u201d He doesn\u2019t say much more as Derek begins to rim him in earnest, gets the tip of his tongue inside before drawing back and doing it again. Soon, Stiles is reduced to a shaking quivering mess fisting his hands into the sheets. \u201cYou\u2019re so lucky werewolves can\u2019t catch anything,\u201d he breathes. \u201cWhatever would you do with that kink? Fuck, do that again, get your tongue deeper, fuck.\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cThought you wanted me to hold you down and fuck you,\u201d Derek says, grinning, and shoves two fingers inside knuckle deep.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cYeah,\u201d Stiles breathes, \u201cI really want that, too.\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cCan\u2019t decide?\u201d Derek mocks, licks from the tip to the base of Stiles\u2019 cock before sucking it into his mouth.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cFucking - unfair,\u201d Stiles pants. \u201cHow am I supposed to decide when I want you to do all the things to me?\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Derek pulls off him again, kisses and licks his way up Stiles\u2019 back before whispering into his ear. \u201cAll the things?\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cAll of them,\u201d Stiles confirms, wiggling his ass against Derek\u2019s groin. This time it\u2019s Derek who has to bite his lip to keep down his moan when his dick slides into the crease between Stiles\u2019 cheeks, catches a little at the rim of his hole. \u201cThis is taking a direction I approve of.\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cI bet,\u201d Derek murmurs, rakes his fingers through Stiles\u2019 hair. \u201cHow would you like me fucking your pretty little mouth first?\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Stiles reaction is instantaneous. His eyes widen almost comically, and then he scrambles to turn around and lie on his back, and it only takes him a second to get his hands behind Derek\u2019s thighs and drag him forwards until he\u2019s essentially sitting on his chest, his dick just inches from Stiles\u2019 face. \u201cLike this?\u201d he asks. \u201cYou sure?\u201d It\u2019s not the most comfortable position to give a blowjob in, but Stiles seems ecstatic.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cAbsolutely,\u201d Stiles says, already drawing his head up to mouth at him. \u201cOne hundred percent.\u201d He can\u2019t reach all of Derek yet and he makes a face as if it physically hurts him so Derek inches closer, brings his thumb to the corner of Stiles\u2019 mouth. It falls open easily under a bit of pressure, and all of Derek\u2019s reservations fly out the window.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cThat\u2019s it,\u201d he murmurs. \u201cOpen your mouth for me.\u201d He guides himself in, slowly at first and only a little because he doesn\u2019t want to choke Stiles but Stiles just brings his hands up to his ass and pulls him forward a little more and gets his hand over the part he cannot fit into his mouth, makes encouraging noises until Derek starts to move his hips and fuck his mouth.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">It\u2019s warm and wet and perfect until Derek realises that he\u2019s a hooker and he\u2019s not supposed to be on the receiving end of blowjobs. Sure, Stiles seems to be enjoying it a lot, and what gets his johns off is always fair game, but Derek is maybe enjoying it a little too much. He\u2019s never had a problem with getting emotional during his tricks, but this is starting to feel less like a job and more like an actual hook-up between equals. That\u2019s not what they are, and it\u2019s dangerous for him to let himself believe it even for a second.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cTurn around,\u201d he orders, climbing off the bed to search the pockets of his jeans for lube and condoms. \u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cI don\u2019t think we need those,\u201d Stiles remarks from where he\u2019s lazily stretching out on the bed, watching him. \u201cI know you can\u2019t carry anything, remember?\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Derek raises his eyebrows skeptically. \u201cYou wanna clean my come out of your ass? Be my guest, I\u2019m not the one dealing with the mess.\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cI think I can deal,\u201d Stiles murmurs.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Derek jams the square foil back into the pocket but takes the lube, because even if Stiles really wants it rough there\u2019s no way he\u2019s gonna fuck a human with nothing but spit to ease the way. He slicks himself up on the way back to the bed, watches Stiles watching him with hungry, earnest eyes. Stiles pushes himself up on his elbows when Derek kneels down behind him, shivers when he pressed close and drapes himself over his back.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cSo, how do you want this?\u201d Derek asks. \u201cStill going for hard and fast?\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cYes.\u201d Stiles grins. \u201cTake me, Sir, take me hard.\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Derek stares. \u201cI can\u2019t believe you\u2019re asking me to fuck you by quoting Firefly.\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cFine, fine, you don\u2019t like pop culture references in bed, I get it,\u201d Stiles huffs. \u201cWant me to rephrase?\u201d He angles his head a little, gets his mouth directly against Derek\u2019s ear. \u201cI want you to fuck me as hard as you can.\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Derek groans, presses his lips to Stiles\u2019s shoulders to keep himself from just pushing forward and doing exactly that. \u201cThink you can take it?\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cDidn\u2019t I tell you not to treat me as if I\u2019m breakable?\u201d Stiles counters. \u201cIf you ask me if I\u2019m sure one more time I\u2019m gonna punch you in the head. Message received?\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cLoud and clear.\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Derek lines up, then, and pushes inside with a single, deep thrust, revels in the way Stiles whines and braces his forehead on his elbow, breathes in deep as he clenches around Derek\u2019s cock. He stills his movements, planning on waiting for Stiles to adjust to the intrusion, but Stiles is having none of it. He starts rolling his hips practically the moment Derek bottoms out, fucks himself back on Derek\u2019s dick. It\u2019s obscene, and Derek can\u2019t help the groan that escapes his lips upon seeing the way Stiles moves, the way he slides in and out of Stiles\u2019 body. He could get off on only this, he thinks; he could ignore his instincts to hold Stiles down and claim him, just because he\u2019s curious to see what else Stiles can do, in what ways he could use Derek to get himself off. He seems to be enjoying himself just fine even with Derek only being a silent spectator.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Derek hates being used, hates being treated like a toy without feelings, a means to get off and nothing more, but watching Stiles like this is fascinating. He doesn\u2019t know what makes the difference; maybe it\u2019s the way Stiles doesn\u2019t really treat him like a prostitute, the way he makes it seem like he\u2019s unabashedly into Derek, not only his body and the idea of fucking someone dangerous.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Maybe it\u2019s just the fact that Derek is really into everything Stiles does.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Stiles turning his head to throw a dirty look at Derek jolts him out of his reverie. \u201cDo you need a written invitation to get with the programme or are you gonna continue to make me do all the work?\u201d he asks. \u201cSex should involve two participating parties, and you\u2019re not participating nearly enough for my ta-hmpf.\u201d His words are muffled by the sheets when Derek splays one of his hands between his shoulder blades and pushes his upper body down, curls his other around his hipbones and snaps his own hips forward sharply.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Stiles cries out, so Derek does it again, and again, increases the pace until Stiles is a shaking, quivering mess beneath him, a string of mostly nonsensical and unintelligible encouragements falling from his lips. Derek can maybe make out one out of five of the garbled sounds leaving his mouth, but Stiles repeats some of them so often they cannot be misinterpreted, like fuck, and Derek, and yes, yes, faster, and fuck me harder, come on.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Stiles tries moving again, rocking his hips back in an attempt to turn their rhythm into something even rougher, and Derek can tell he\u2019s getting desperate to get off when he pulls one arm out from under his head and reaches down to touch himself.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Derek catches his hand before he can wrap it around his erection. \u201cNo,\u201d he growls lowly, threateningly, yanks Stiles\u2019s hand away and grabs him by the scruff of his neck with his other hand, uses it to pin him down. \u201cYou don\u2019t get to touch yourself. You hear me?\u201d He leans down to drape himself over Stiles\u2019 back, breathes directly into his ear. \u201cYou wanted me to hold you down and fuck your brains out, so you will lie there like a good boy and take it. I\u2019m the only one who gets to touch you, but I won\u2019t even need to, will I? Just look at you. You\u2019re so greedy for my cock, begging to be fucked. I bet I can make you come without jerking you off, don\u2019t you think? You\u2019re gonna be good for me, do as I say?\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cFuck,\u201d Stiles gasps out. \u201cFuck, yes, just, please, Derek, please -\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Derek lets his hand slide around Stiles\u2019 neck, urges him to turn his face to the side to capture his mouth in a heated kiss, licking the pleas right off his tongue. Stiles whines low in his throat, bites at Derek\u2019s bottom lip, his stuttering breath warm against Derek\u2019s mouth. Derek can tell he\u2019s close, and he knows exactly what he can do to push him over the edge. He presses his thumb against the soft hollow where Stiles\u2019 neck meets his jaw a little, lets himself feel Stiles\u2019 racing heartbeat where the blood rushes hot underneath the skin, wraps his right arm arm around Stiles waist and hauls him backwards, until Derek is sitting on his heels with Stiles in his lap. A little nudge against his knees makes Stiles\u2019 legs slide apart further, lets him sink down more snugly into his lap.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">It only takes one more sharp thrust upwards, driving deeper into Stiles than the other position would allow him with gravity working in his favour and Stiles lets out a broken, choking sound, mouth going slack with pleasure. Derek uses the hand that\u2019s still on his neck to tilt his head back, marvels at the pale stretch of skin \u00a0and sinks blunt teeth into the tendons of his neck. Stiles screams, throws his arms back to fist his hand in Derek\u2019s hair almost painfully hard, and then he\u2019s coming in long, hot stripes all over himself and the sheets, shattering into pieces in Derek\u2019s arms.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">It almost wrenches his orgasm from Derek, too, the combination of seeing Stiles\u2019 climax and the feeling of his ass clenching around him, but he grits his teeth, buries his head in Stiles\u2019 shoulder and tries, desperately, to hold on, to draw it out as long as possible. When he comes, he\u2019ll have to face reality again; he\u2019ll have to leave the warmth of Stiles\u2019 body, the addicting thrill of their bodies moving against each other. He doesn\u2019t want to go outside again, into the cold, where he\u2019ll have to wait for another john to come around and fuck him. He wants to stay buried in Stiles forever. That\u2019s probably just the hormones talking, but he doesn\u2019t care.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Stiles throws a wrench in his plans, though, when he\u2019s not being reduced to quiet sobs and gasping intakes of breath anymore. The moment he opens his mouth again, Derek knows it\u2019s game over. \u201cFuck, Derek, yes, come on, fill me up, I wanna feel you, want everyone to know I\u2019m yours, come on.\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Derek groans when he comes, white-hot pleasure crashing over him, bites his lip until it bleeds to keep the string of embarrassing, destructive thoughts from tumbling out. They fall back onto the bed, boneless, and Derek has just enough control over his muscles left to ensure he doesn\u2019t crush Stiles underneath him. He pulls out begrudgingly, and for a moment they simply lie side by side, staring at the ceiling and trying to catch their breath.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cHoly God,\u201d Stiles says a few minutes later, blissed out look still on his face. \u201cWe should do that all the time.\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Derek snorts. \u201cWhat, you have a fortune lying around somewhere?\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Stiles elbows him in the side. \u201cStop ruining my afterglow with depressing shit.\u201d He rolls on his side, frowns at Derek. \u201cCan I ask you a question?\u201d he says hesitantly.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Derek attempts a shrug. \u201cSure. Can\u2019t promise I\u2019ll answer.\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cHow did you end up here?\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cIn this room, with you?\u201d Derek raises his eyebrows. \u201cWell, I was standing outside and you came up to me and -\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cStop being a smartass, that\u2019s my job,\u201d Stiles says. \u201cYou know what I meant.\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cDo I now?\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cCome on, Derek. You can\u2019t tell me you enjoy this. Not, uh, this night specifically, because I hope you enjoyed that at least half as much as I did, which was a lot, by the way, I mean...turning tricks. I know some people do this because they want to, because they enjoy having sex and getting money out of it, too, but you don\u2019t.\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cOh really,\u201d Derek says flatly. \u201cAnd what makes you an expert at what I do or do not like?\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Stiles pokes his nose. \u201cIt\u2019s written all over your face. And just...you don\u2019t strike me as the type to, I don\u2019t know, drop out of school and go live on the streets for funsies.\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cI didn\u2019t,\u201d Derek says after a while. He doesn\u2019t know why he keeps talking. He doesn\u2019t talk about his past with lot of people. Definitely not with strangers. Definitely not with strangers who are his clients, Jesus Fucking Christ, what is wrong with him? \u201cIt was just me and my sister, and she made sure I finished high school, got into college. I had a scholarship and a job to pay the bills. Then my sister disappeared, and I went looking for her.\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cDid you find her?\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cI found parts,\u201d Derek says, voice hard and cold; it\u2019s the only way he can keep it from quivering. \u201cI took some time off, tried to get back on my feet. When I went back, they\u2019d cancelled my scholarship and wouldn\u2019t give me a new one. Same with my job. They fired me because I was unreliable, apparently. Couldn\u2019t find another one, either; word about werewolves travels fast, even in big cities, and once you have a reputation, there\u2019s no going back from it. Couldn\u2019t get a loan, either, cause I don\u2019t have job.\u201d He shrugs again. \u201cHad to pay the bills somehow. It\u2019s not enough to cover the expenses of college, obviously, but it pays the rent.\u201d He looks at Stiles coolly. \u201cGood enough of a sob story for you?\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cThat\u2019s not why I asked,\u201d Stiles says quietly.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cIsn\u2019t it?\u201d Derek asks sharply, turns around to slide out of the bed and starts fishing for his clothes. He swallows down the bitter taste in his mouth, knows he shouldn\u2019t have said as much as he did.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cDerek!\u201d Stiles grabs his arm, holds him back. \u201cYou know it\u2019s illegal for them to discriminate you like this, right? You lost a family member, that\u2019s a valid reason for anyone to take some time off, you can fight against that.\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cSure, I\u2019ll sue with money I don\u2019t have, because every jury in the world is gonna believe the word of a werewolf over the word of a human,\u201d Derek spits out. \u201cEspecially an unrespectable werewolf who works as a hooker.\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Stiles clenches his jaw. He looks angry, for the first time since Derek met him, but not angry at Derek. It\u2019s a helpless, futile rage against the society they live in. Derek knows from experience; he\u2019s still angry, all the time, but he\u2019s stopped thinking about it most of the time, because it just makes him want to punch things. There\u2019s nothing he can do to change the world, and it\u2019s better to survive by dealing with it.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cYou know,\u201d Stiles says after a while, when Derek has almost finished dressing, \u201cthere\u2019s a spot opening at the Beacon Hills Police Department. My dad\u2019s been thinking about filling the vacancy with a werewolf, because he\u2019s being trying to fight discrimination against werewolves and he thinks it\u2019ll be easier for victims to come around and talk about it if there\u2019s someone they feel they can trust.\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cShut up, Stiles. I\u2019m not your fucking charity case. This is not Pretty Woman, and you\u2019re not the hero who swoops in and saves the poor, miserable prostitute from her horrible life on the streets.\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cI\u2019m aware,\u201d Stiles replies heatedly. \u201cDoes it look like I sit on a huge amount of money that I can finance your future with? I\u2019m not a knight in a shining armour. I don\u2019t wanna be. I\u2019m not fucking telling you what to do, Derek, or how to live your life. I\u2019m just saying, if you want to get out, there are options, even if you don\u2019t believe there are, and this is one of them. Do with that information what you want.\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Derek stuffs the crumpled dollar bills lying on the night stand into his jeans and turns the door handle. \u201cYou have another ten minutes to get cleaned up, get dressed, and check out or they\u2019ll charge you for another hour,\u201d he informs Stiles matter-of-factly.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">He leaves without saying goodbye.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n<strong>\u221e</strong>\n</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">He doesn\u2019t see Derek again for months. Stiles goes back to the corner where they met, once, a few weeks later, but Derek is nowhere to be seen. He hovers pathetically for an hour or two, until he\u2019s freezing his ass off and has to fess up to the fact that Derek probably isn\u2019t coming, and that even if he were around, he\u2019d probably not want to see Stiles.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">And then, well, winter break is over, and he has to return to Berkeley for his final semester, and he doesn\u2019t dwell on it too much anymore. Well. He tries, at least. Lydia never has to know the reason he stopped hooking up with people isn\u2019t actually that he\u2019s too busy studying; that\u2019s partly true, yes, but it mostly has to do with no one being able to live up to Derek\u2019s standards and no one, in general, being, you know, Derek. He\u2019s never telling her that, though. She\u2019s already convinced he\u2019s slightly insane, he doesn\u2019t need to add to the evidence by telling her he\u2019s sort of hopelessly hung up on someone he paid for sex.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Christ, he\u2019s a disaster.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">When he comes back during spring break, the first thing he does after entering Beacon Hills is drive to the station to hug the shit out of his dad. He falls through the office door with his usual grace that Scott once likened to a dying antelope, already halfway through his greeting before he even closes the door. \u201cYo, daddy-oh, Eagle Two has touched down and can I just say, Roscoe needs new brakes and also I know you\u2019ve been eating doughnuts again, seriously, can you not -\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cStiles,\u201d his dad interrupts him, rolling his eyes long-sufferingly and gestures at the person next to him. \u201cI\u2019m kind of busy.\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cSo?\u201d Stiles asks. He\u2019s never cared much about interrupting meetings, or whatever the deputies call their gossip hours nowadays. He\u2019s known everyone here for as long as he can remember, he practically grew up around the station, no one cares about his antics anymore. Or at least they\u2019ve gotten used to suffering through them.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">It\u2019s only when he actually looks at the man that he stops dead in his tracks. \u201cTell me you didn\u2019t get arrested,\u201d he blurts out.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">His father stares at him as if he\u2019s lost his mind. Which, granted, he does with alarming frequency. \u201cStiles,\u201d he says, \u201cI would introduce you to our new deputy in training, but clearly you already know each other. And I don\u2019t even want to know how you know him, or why you would think he\u2019s been arrested. Please don\u2019t ever give me any details. Derek, I\u2019m gonna get the paperwork for you, and I want it done by tomorrow, understood?\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cYes, Sir,\u201d Derek nods.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cGood.\u201d His dad pats Stiles on the shoulder as he walks past. \u201cGood to have you home, son. I\u2019ll leave you two to...catch up. I\u2019ll be back in five, though, so no sex on the desk.\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cI hate you,\u201d Stiles says, feeling the blood rushing to his head and heating up his cheeks.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cSure thing, kiddo,\u201d his dad says good-naturedly, and walks out.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Stiles clears his throat, smiles shyly at Derek. He looks good. Better than when they met, which should be impossible, but it\u2019s true. He looks happier. Healthier. \u201cSo,\u201d he says, hesitantly. \u201cHi?\u201d</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Derek smiles. \u201cHi.\u201d</p>"
}
