  "text": "<p>Marinette was looking forward to going home, falling into her bed, and hopefully falling asleep as quickly as possible. It had been a particularly stressful day all around, and for once it wasn\u2019t Papillion\u2019s fault.</p>\n<p>No, her day had been ruined by his number one assistant, Chloe.</p>\n<p>Marinette was used to Chloe\u2019s constant bullying and cheap insults, and normally just brushed off the attacks of her spoiled classmate. However, this time the spoiled pest had stepped up her game to a whole new level. \u00a0Scalding hot coffee dumped on her at the beginning of the day, getting knocked over in the halls on the way to and from different classes, even getting locked into the restroom and adding yet another tardy make to her already disastrous record. To give credit where it was do, Sabrina was doing most of the work.</p>\n<p>She knew why of course. Adrien. The more attention he paid to Marinette, the worse Chloe\u2019s attitude became. It was a clear message- stay away from Adrien or else.</p>\n<p>Well Chloe could torture her all she wanted, because Adrien\u2019s courteous attention was the highlight of her world. His hopeful smiles when he saw her in the mornings, his endearing attempts to include her in conversations during the day, his numerous invitations for her and Alya to join him and Nino for lunch. And lately, the long soul searching stares, his eyes full of an intensity that left her heart racing and her stomach in knots. Somehow, she had become someone that Adrien wanted to be around, someone he wanted to talk to and get to know, despite his obvious confusion at her constant awkwardness.</p>\n<p>If only she could be half as composed as he was when faced with this new wave of attention from the love of her life and, god willing, father of her future children.</p>\n<p>Sometimes she could manage whole conversations, especially if other people were present or they had a prearranged topic such as schoolwork. She even felt she could say they were truly friends now. But whenever she tried to instigate anything with him on a more personal level, she would often find herself reverting back into a blushing, stuttering mess.</p>\n<p>Marinette trudged up the stairs to her home, grateful that her parents were busy in the bakery so she didn\u2019t have to tell them about her day until she had a chance to calm down and play off her frustration.</p>\n<p>She clambered up all three flights of stairs to her bedroom, looking forward to the calming familiarity of her own private space.</p>\n<p>Her entire expression darkened as she took in the jarring mass of black that stood in stark contrast to the soft pink of her comfortable, if occupied, room.</p>\n<p>\u201cChat, what are you doing here?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0This was just getting ridiculous. It was the third time this week that he had visited her, and Marinette was reaching the end of her patience with the increasingly clingy cat boy currently grinning at her like he had just eaten a canary from his casually sprawled position in her desk chair.</p>\n<p>\u201cI wanted to talk to you princess.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI already told you not to call me that, I have no interest in your ridiculous flirtations Chaton.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo you keep telling me, and yet I just can\u2019t help myself.\u201d He smiled, pushing off with his feet and spinning the chair in dizzying circles.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo! No spinning, no flirting, no nothing! It\u2019s bad enough that I constantly find you nesting on my balcony, but now you have broken into my room!\u201d Marinette seethed.</p>\n<p>\u201cOK first- you left the trap door open so I did not break in.\u201d Chat replied calmly, still not budging from the chair. \u201cAnd secondly, I simply enjoy spending time with you and occasionally cat napping while I wait. Your balcony is wonderfully sunny you know. Besides I am not a bird, I don\u2019t nest.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou set up your own lawn chair on my roof!\u201d She hissed through gritted teeth, grasping on to his arms and yanking to remove the smirking boy from HER chair. Unfortunately, without the strength granted to her with her transformation, it was proving to be a much more daunting task.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell you didn\u2019t like me stealing yours, as you put it, and the ground wasn\u2019t as comfortable.\u201d Chat grinned, clearly enjoying her struggles to dislodge him.</p>\n<p>Giving up on trying to pull him up Marinette, twisted the chair so that she could grip the back and simply tilted the whole things forward, dumping the irritating feline onto the floor.</p>\n<p>Instead of giving her the satisfaction of falling into a heap, Chat rolled into a summersault and vaulted gracefully to his feet, bouncing on his toes like a kid on a sugar rush. Marinette glowered. She was not impressed.\u00a0 She absolutely was not. There was definitely nothing impressive or attractive about the fidgeting 6 feet of blond and leather currently smirking at her.</p>\n<p>Maybe if she climbed up to the terrace he would stalk after her and she could push him off the balcony. That might wipe that self-satisfied look off his face.</p>\n<p>Marinette sighed. She would never actually do it, even if she knew that he wouldn\u2019t actually be injured by the drop while transformed. \u201cDon\u2019t you have other places to be?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cProbably. But this is far more important.\u201d Chat replied lightly, hopping forward slightly towards her.</p>\n<p>\u201cJust come back another time, I have had a really rough day Chat.\u201d Marinette tried, hoping to maybe salvage her plan of a long stress free nap.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhile I would normally never deny such a lovely lady anything that she asks for, there is a matter of utmost importance that I must speak with you about.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd what is that?\u201d</p>\n<p>Chat stepped forward closing the distance between them and placing his hands on her shoulders. Marinette froze against his touch, which was silly because this was just Chat. Chat whom she did not have feelings for. Chat who was not becoming an increasingly recurring character in her more romantic daydreams. Chat was not allowed to take her breath away with his cheeky smiles and soft expressions.\u00a0 Chat who was leaning down towards her so that their faces were mere inches apart looking at her with a hungry expression that made her skin heat with something that definitely wasn\u2019t irritation and that she knew she would later be filing in that increasing large mental folder of moments she pretended never happened.</p>\n<p>He flashed her a terrifyingly triumphant grin and before she could even process what he was doing spun her around so that she was now staring dumbly at the wall above her computer.</p>\n<p>\u201cI think it\u2019s time we had a chat about your choice of d\u00e9cor princess.\u201d He whispered into her ear. \u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>Marinette felt every ounce of blood drain from her face as she stared at the massive collection of posters plastered across her wall. She was never going to live this down. Chat was going to tease her until the end of time. Of all the people in the world to have discovered her collection this was the second worst scenario she could have envisioned, with Adrien himself being the first. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what you are talking about!\u201d Marinette blurted out desperately. She immediately regretted the pathetic attempted at deflection when Chat dissolved into hysterical giggles.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re wall is plastered with photos of a boy your age, half of them surrounded by heart doodles.\u201d He smiled at her, but his expression was less devious that she would have expected given how easily he could now tease her about her crush. If anything his countenance was sheepish, his eyes still sparkled with that ever present sense of mischief and a gleam of something else she couldn\u2019t quite identify, but she could just catch the slight furrowing of his eyebrows behind the mask, and his lower lip was curved under his teeth. That was odd. She had only seen him bite his lip when he was bracing for another rejection from Ladybug.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo? What of it?\u201d Marinette countered, but her anger and bravado had largely faded in light of his uncharacteristically shy demeanor, and her voice quavered.</p>\n<p>\u201cCome on Princess, even I can figure out what that means.\u201d His voice was soft and almost hopeful. It seemed out of place for her feline friend, but still it struck her with a strange sense of familiarity.</p>\n<p>Of course he is going to sound familiar, Marinette mentally scolded herself. He\u2019s been your partner for almost 2 years after all!</p>\n<p>Besides she had bigger problems that nagging feelings of de ja vu. Specifically how to convince Chat that she was not, in fact, an insane stalker and unrepentant phone thief. Although he didn\u2019t have any way of knowing about her various phone related activities. At least he hadn\u2019t found the schedule, so there was still a small chance she could play this off instead of just hurling herself out the window in humiliated misery.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat is Adrien Agreste.\u201d She stated with as much haughty indifference as she could muster.</p>\n<p>\u201cI am well aware of that fact.\u201d Chat retorted, raising one eyebrow.</p>\n<p>\u201cHis father, Gabriel Agreste is one of my favorite designers. I happen to like his work and use it for inspiration.\u201d She smirked. There. That sounded believable right? After all Chat knew that she wanted to be a fashion designer. It had come up more than once in their conversations during his impromptu visits to her balcony. \u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI see.\u201d Chat deadpanned. \u201cIf that is the case then why don\u2019t you have any shots of the women\u2019s collection? This season\u2019s formal wear selection was considered particularly inspired. Given the types of outfits you have said you prefer to work on wouldn\u2019t that be a better choice? The 2014 Spring line wouldn\u2019t be a bad way to go either.\u201d</p>\n<p>Since when did Chat know anything about fashion? Marinette thought savagely. She wasn\u2019t sure if she was more irritated by the fact that he was calling her on her bluff or that he was right about those being two of her favorite Gabriel lines.</p>\n<p>Well if Chat wanted to call her out and make her confess to her crush for his amusement he could dream on. She wasn\u2019t going to give him the satisfaction.</p>\n<p>\u201cMaybe I don\u2019t want to be influenced by the oppressive standards of female beauty imposed on us by the fashion industry and its malnourished models.\u201d Thank you Alya.</p>\n<p>Chat didn\u2019t even bother to respond to that one, instead his eyebrow raised impossibly higher. How did he even manage to HAVE that much expression in his eyebrows! They were covered by his mask for god sake!\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI just like looking at the clothes and\u2026 stuff.\u201d Ok <em>she </em>didn\u2019t even think it sounded believable anymore. Maybe she needed to reevaluate her plan of jumping out the window.</p>\n<p>\u00a0Marinette could feel her face flaming into a deep crimson as she desperately tried to think of anything else she could say to save her rapidly waning credibility. She had already hit rock bottom after all.</p>\n<p>\u201cIf you were modelling high end fashion I would probably have posters of you all over my wall too!\u201d Marinette muttered defensively.</p>\n<p>. It took about 2 seconds for her brain to process exactly what she had just done.</p>\n<p>Never mind, she had found a lower place.</p>\n<p>Chats eyes widened to slits and then an exuberant smirk stretched across his features.</p>\n<p>\u201cCareful, you are going to get my hopes up Spots.\u201d He teased.</p>\n<p>Marinette could feel every ounce of color draining from her face at the odd nickname.</p>\n<p>He knew. She didn\u2019t know how he knew but somehow he must have figured out her identity. It would explain why he had begun consistently pestering her over the course of the last 2 months.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhen did you find out?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFind out what?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWas it after the last akuma attack? I thought I heard someone following me before I transformed.\u201d</p>\n<p>He had the audacity to laugh. \u201cActually no, but thanks for the conformation bugaboo.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell me that you didn\u2019t know!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cActually I only suspected. But to be fair I have been about 75% sure since we faced off against the Virtuoso and after that it wasn\u2019t hard to find more evidence in my favor. Lately I\u2019ve been hovering in the 90-95% sure range.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo what\u2019s with the nickname? If you didn\u2019t KNOW then why would you call me Spots?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou were blushing. You literally had bright red spots on your face.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh. So wait\u2026 you really didn\u2019t know?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNope. But don\u2019t fret My Lady, it was sure to come out eventually, and as I said it wasn\u2019t like this came as a surprise.\u201d</p>\n<p>Marinette sank into her chair. It was unfathomable. How could he have known? She still had no idea who Chat was underneath the leather and puns and smirking. But somehow her partner had managed to find her. Of all of the hundreds of girls in Paris, he had found<em> her</em>, clumsy, insecure, phone stealing Marinette, and figured out her secret.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat gave it away?\u201d She finally asked.</p>\n<p>Chat looked thoughtful for a bit, staring around her room idly. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to say where it started. A lot of little things I guess. The way you phrase things, oh! and there is this weird arm thing you do when you get really flustered.\u201d He waved his arms around his head in demonstration.</p>\n<p>Marinette just gaped at him.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnyways, after the fight with Virtuoso when you yelled at Alya for being too close again, it sort of all just clicked together, so I started looking for proof that my hunch was right.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat sort of proof?\u201d Marinette asked dazed. She couldn\u2019t believe that she was so transparent to this boy. Chat had never struck her as the overly observant type, but clearly he had been paying a lot more attention than she gave him credit for.</p>\n<p>\u201cJust more of the same really.\u201d Chat shrugged. \u201cLooking to see if you disappear during akuma attacks, trivial stuff like favorite color or favorite foods. Honestly I was surprised I didn\u2019t suspect you sooner, you act surprisingly similar in and out of costume.\u201d He turned back to look at her with a soft smile. \u201cWell\u2026 most of the time.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh.\u201d Marinette really didn\u2019t know what to say. She was still stunned by this new twist of events.</p>\n<p>She was also extremely flattered. Despite Tikki\u2019s constant reminders that she was the same person without her superhero guise, Marinette had always felt like an imposter. No one would even think that she was worthy to be the great Ladybug if they ever discovered the truth.</p>\n<p>Yet here was Chat, who idolized her, perfectly content with her civilian identity. It was the greatest compliment she had ever received, and her heart swelled with affection for her loyal partner.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo is this some sort of celebrity crush or should I be jealous?\u201d Chat asked, creeping forward to squint at one of the doodles on a particularly large magazine cutouts.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a celebrity crush. We go to school together and are friends, well sort of, so I am not just some pathetic fangirl.\u201d Marinette defended, giving up on the idea that she could convince him there was a less embarrassing reason why she had wallpapered her room with Adrien.</p>\n<p>\u201cEven if you were just a fangirl I don\u2019t think you know how to be pathetic My Lady.\u201d Chat said kindly. \u201cAnd what do you mean, \u201csort of\u201d friends?\u201d \u00a0He tilted his head questioningly and even made little air quotes with his claws. Marinette refused to call it endearing.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell we are friends. He sits in front of me. We hang out sometimes and our best friends are dating so we are thrown together a lot, but in spite of that we aren\u2019t really close I guess.\u201d She couldn\u2019t meet Chat\u2019s eyes as she continued. \u201cI sometimes have trouble acting normally around him. I sort of\u2026 stutter, and babble. Sometimes it\u2019s worse. He never says anything and is really nice about it, but I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if he thinks I am insane.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI guarantee he thinks you\u2019re adorable.\u201d Chat said, and Again Marinette marveled at her partner\u2019s unshakably high opinion of her.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo when should I expect the wedding invitation?\u201d Chat taunted, his Cheshire grin back in place. \u201cOnce you have been snagged up I doubt this \u2018sort of\u2019 friend will be letting you go.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe aren\u2019t even dating.\u201d Marinette rolled her eyes.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell then what are you waiting for? Get to it love bug, chop chop.\u201d He waved his hand at her as though shooing her off to go running after Adrien.</p>\n<p>\u201cShouldn\u2019t you be telling me all the reasons why this is a terrible idea and how purrrfectly happy I would be with you instead?\u201d</p>\n<p>Chat\u2019s eyes lit up at her sarcastic pun. \u201cNo, I trust My Lady\u2019s judgement.\u201d He said brightly, grinning like a kid at Christmas.</p>\n<p>\u201cSure. You are going to be content to see me chasing after someone else.\u201d Marinette stated unconvinced.</p>\n<p>\u201cI think I am surprisingly ok with this particular turn of events.\u201d Chat responded mildly, making a show of examining his claws the way Chloe would a new French manicure.</p>\n<p>\u201cIsn\u2019t my already loving someone other than you going to ruin your happy fantasies of whisking me off into the sunset?\u201d She continued. After all Chat had been doggedly pursuing her for the entirety of their partnership. Not once had he ever wavered in his endless flirtations. With every passing month he would continue to avow his eternal and undying devotion to her.</p>\n<p>While she had never entirely believed him to be serious about any of it, this calm acceptance of her innocent crush\u2026 ok who was she kidding\u2026 her overpowering obsession, was not at all what she would have expected from her Casanova Kitty. It was\u2026 unsettling.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh contraire buginette, I have told you before I care only for your happiness and if browbeaten painfully oblivious models are your thing than I will do everything in my considerable power to aid and support you.\u201d Chat purred out with a lethal twinkle in his eyes.</p>\n<p>Once again Marinette felt a looming sense of dread, like there was some sort of grand joke that she had been excluded from. A far cry from pouting or being put out by her admittedly self-imposed unavailability, Chat seemed almost gleeful about her crush.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo when do you plan on asking out this friend of yours?\u201d Chat inquired.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u201cI can\u2019t just ask him out!\u201d Marinette spluttered.</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you want him to come to you instead?\u201d He ask, with genuine curiosity.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that! I mean, that would be great if he did but I don\u2019t expect\u2026 the point is I can\u2019t just ask him out!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d Chat pressed, his features scrunched into an adorable look of confusion.</p>\n<p>\u201cBecause he\u2019ll say no.\u201d Marinette said softly fixing her eyes on the floor and finally giving voice to her deepest fear. At least now, as ridiculous and awkward as she often was around him, she could still pretend that one day she would evolve into the kind of girl who could be confidant and sexy and deserving of his affections.\u00a0 Maybe there would come the day where she could confess her feelings and they could be together. But right now? Right now she was just boring, insecure Marinette who had no real shot with a boy like that, no matter how much she wanted to.</p>\n<p>She looked up at Chat, expecting to see pity, or maybe even understanding. For all of Chat\u2019s faults he was incredibly kind and loyal and he had always been very sympathetic and supportive of her own failings throughout their partnership. Perhaps that was why she decided to confide in him, he had always been a compassionate friend and never failed to make her feel supported in spite of her flaws.</p>\n<p>What she didn\u2019t expect was the look of absolute disbelief plastered across his features. The astonished cat just stared at her, jaw hanging open for several seconds before he burst out into loud, genuine laughter.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not funny!\u201d Marinette shouted an odd combination of anger and hurt swelling up in her chest.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry but yes it is\u201d Chat managed to choke out between giggles. \u201cYou actually think anyone would say no to you My Lady?\u201d</p>\n<p>Marinette\u2019s head began to spin at the look of unabashed adoration shining out of her partner\u2019s eyes even as he continued to laugh at her predicament, and she struggled not to melt in gratitude at his unwavering belief in her value, even knowing her real identity behind the mask. She knew that she would most likely lose a good deal of sleep in the near future re-evaluating the merits of keeping her superhero life strictly professional. She swallowed and forced herself to focus back on the original conversation about the other blonde haired green eyes boy who ruined her sleep.</p>\n<p>\u201cI haven\u2019t told him that I am Ladybug.\u201d Marinette countered her voice still barely above a whisper.</p>\n<p>\u201cI never for a moment thought you had.\u201d Chat grinned. \u201cAfter all it would be a-paw-ling if you starting telling your secrets to a random civilian before your own partner.\u201d He teased. \u201cOf course I also don\u2019t know what that has to do with anything bugaboo.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat was terrible. You\u2019re puns are still always terrible.\u201d She deflected, although she could feel the corners of her mouth lifting slightly.</p>\n<p>\u201cThey still make you smile.\u201d He shot back, although his tone was gentle and his laughter had finally slowed. \u201cSo why do you think he would say no?\u201d Chat asked.</p>\n<p>\u201cI mean\u2026 look at me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Chat raised an eyebrow suggestively his lips curving into an unholy smirk.</p>\n<p>\u201cNot like that you jerk!\u201d Marinette scowled grabbing the first thing her hand came in contact with on her desk and grinning when the flung object smacked him in the face.</p>\n<p>\u201cNice choice of weapon Princess.\u201d Chat teased rubbing his nose and holding out\u2026</p>\n<p>Oh dear god, she had literally thrown Adrien in his face, or at least her framed picture of him.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re loving this aren\u2019t you?\u201d She groaned.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah I really kind of am.\u201d</p>\n<p>Marinette sighed and dropped down into her desk chair, exhausted by what might be the most the worst non akuma related day in the history of her life.</p>\n<p>Chat squatted down in front of her, resting his elbows on her knees, his Cheshire grin back in place.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo where do you want go for your first date?\u201d Chat ask, \u201cI know Adrien you know, I could drop a few hints.\u201d He wiggled his eyebrows at her again and in spite of her irritation she felt a little better hearing him act like her success was a foregone conclusion.</p>\n<p>\u201cI already told you he would probably turn me down.\u201d Marinette said.</p>\n<p>Chat frowned at her, eyes narrowing slightly and tail twitching in irritation at her continued protestations.</p>\n<p>\u201cI am 100% confidant that if you walked up to him and told him that you wanted to be in a relationship that he would say yes. Well either that or just grab you up and kiss you, it could go either way really.\u201d</p>\n<p>Marinette flushed deeply at the mental image of Adrien grabbing her and pulling her into a passionate kiss. What if they were still at school and everyone could see? She could imagine Alya and Nino shrieking in delight, mingled with Chloe\u2019s and Lila\u2019s banshee like screams of rage, but she could just tune it all out because Adrien was kissing her. Hesitantly nibbling at her lips to try and deepen the kiss as he cradled the back of her neck with\u2026</p>\n<p>Yeah as if that would ever happen. She tried to banish the sudden jolt of warmth in her gut her fantasy had produced.</p>\n<p>\u201cIf you really think that Adrien would ever try something like that you clearly don\u2019t know him very well.\u201d Marinette huffed, crossing her arms in front of her.</p>\n<p>Chat Laughed again, hopping up from the floor and pacing around the room excitedly, clearly scheming.</p>\n<p>\u201cOk Chat you have had your fun, time to scamper back to wherever you came from.\u201d Marinette stated, ready finally take her long overdue nap. \u201cAnd no more coming into my room.\u201d</p>\n<p>Chat stopped his pacing and stood completely still for a few seconds before turning towards her with a challenging glint in his eye.</p>\n<p>\u201cTell you what Princess, I will make you a deal. If you ask him out and he rejects you, like you seem to think he will, I will never drop by for any unscheduled visits that don\u2019t involve purple butterflies again. However, if I am right and he says yes, then not only do I reserve the right to continue basking in your presence whenever I so choose, but you will also provide me with free croissants every Monday, Wednesday and Friday for the next two months.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want to make this bet kitty.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, I am pretty sure I do.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYour loss. Make sure you take your lawn chair with you.\u201d She said airily. Happy to finally be getting the upper hand in the conversation.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou have three days to ask out you\u2019re pretty model boy or the bet will be considered forfeit and you will have to face the consequences.\u201d Chat stated solemnly.</p>\n<p>\u201cThree days? What is this The Little Mermaid?\u201d Marinette tried to sound flippant but her stomach felt like lead. Three days? She had been trying desperately to get the courage to confess to Adrien for the last two years and now she only had three days?</p>\n<p>\u201cThree days is plenty of time to manage a single question to a boy you see every day.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd what do you mean by consequences?\u201d Marinette ask, hoping that if she kept him talking that he wouldn\u2019t notice the color draining from her face or the shaking of her hands at the idea of confessing before the end of the week.</p>\n<p>\u201cIf you forfeit the bet, in addition to my unrevoked visitations, you will be providing croissants every weekday for the next three months.\u201d</p>\n<p>Ok that didn\u2019t sound too bad, Marinette considered.</p>\n<p>\u201cAND\u201d Chat continued \u201cI get to kiss you. One time, at a time and place of my choosing. No questions, no complaining.\u201d</p>\n<p>Marinette knew that her face must have gone as red as her suit. There were so many ways something like that could blow up in her face.</p>\n<p>What if Chat showed up at school and kissed her? What would everyone say? Alya would probably film the whole thing and post it all over the Ladyblog. What if her parents found out? Not to mention Chat\u2019s crazy fangirls. She would probably be hunted down and murdered. Or worse, what if he waited and kissed her in front of Adrien? Adrien might think she was involved with Chat! Then she would never find a way to win him over! Adrien adored Ladybug and Chat Noir he would never try to compete! Besides that, Adrien totally bought into the crazy theory that Ladybug and Chat we destined to be together. What if it ruined their friendship? What if he blamed her for coming between his favorite celebrity couple?\u00a0</p>\n<p>Oh god what if he tried to kiss her while she was Ladybug? What if he kissed her in front of the press after an akuma attack? It would confirm to every celebrity gossip site that they were more than just partners\u2026</p>\n<p>She turned and glared at Chat who met her gaze with a cheerful smile and a raised eyebrow.</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u201cIf this is too much for you Princess I could be persuaded to forget the whole thing for one kiss here and now, and a small box of Macaroons.\u201d</p>\n<p>Marinette seethed at the knowing, gleeful expression on his face.</p>\n<p>This was exactly what he wanted. He had been chasing after his kiss from Ladybug from their first akuma and now he thought he had finally backed her into a corner. Well she was never one to back down from a challenge and she would not let her Tomcat of a partner win that easily.</p>\n<p>\u201cOk fine. I accept. I\u2019ll do it.\u201d She spat, \u201cI\u2019ll ask out Adrien and then I won\u2019t have to deal with your uninvited interruptions anymore.\u201d She glared at Chat as if she could banish him and his infuriating smirk with sheer force of will. No one stood up to the full force of her stare. Even Alya had been known to cower whenever Marinette truly lost her temper and dropped into a quite rage.</p>\n<p>Chat only grinned wider. \u201cI look forward to my free croissants.\u201d</p>\n<p>Marinette was not surprised to find Chat lying on her chaise lounge waiting for her in her room the next day when she came home from Alya\u2019s.</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t get too comfortable kitty.\u201d Marinette sang out happily, \u201cI will have you know I had an entire conversation with Adrien today, AND we even went and had lunch together, at my suggestion.\u201d He didn\u2019t need to know that Alya and Nino had gone as well.</p>\n<p>\u201cAh but did you actually ask him out?\u201d Chat replied smugly, not even bothering to open his eyes much less sit up.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo.\u201d Marinette grumbled.</p>\n<p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think so.\u201d Chat smirked. \u201cStill, it sounds like you made some great progress. I am very proud of you My Lady.\u201d</p>\n<p>There was a good chance he was teasing her, but Marinette found that she didn\u2019t care. She was proud of herself too. It had been a fantastic day, made even better by Chloe\u2019s absence due to \u201cillness.\u201d If Marinette had to guess she would say that Chloe had caught a bad case of \u2018I don\u2019t want to take my history exam\u2019-itus.</p>\n<p>\u201cThank you.\u201d Marinette replied graciously. \u201cYou know, maybe you will end up winning this bet of yours after all.\u201d She smiled as she dropped down onto the chaise next to her partner, who finally opened one eye and looked at her, a soft smile of his own tugging at the corner of his lips.</p>\n<p>\u201cI never doubted it for a second.\u201d He said lightly closing his eyes again and snuggling back against the pillow. \u201cNow I can go back to dreaming about my free croissants.\u201d He joked.</p>\n<p>Marinette hummed in response, enjoying the companionable silence. <br> \u201cDid you really have fun today?\u201d Chat asked quietly. His eyes were still closed and he hadn\u2019t moved, but Marinette could feel a slight tension emanating from her partner, and she knew he was anxious as to her reply. She considered what to say. Despite his protestations it couldn\u2019t be fun for him to listen to her cooing over someone else. What if this whole experience broke him? She wasn\u2019t sure what she would do if their friendship fell apart. Still\u2026 he had been nothing but supportive of her, and she owed him her honesty.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah I really did.\u201d She felt him relax and she let out a breath she didn\u2019t realize she had been holding.</p>\n<p>\u201cGood. You\u2019re happiness is everything to me.\u201d He said softly. Marinette smiled down at her partner. No matter how this whole bet went down, she had a feeling that things wouldn\u2019t be so bad as long as he was on her side.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey Chat?\u201d<br> \u201cYes My Lady?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWant to play Ultimate Mecha Strike III?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course!\u201d He shot up from the chair excitedly and Marinette laughed.</p>\n<p>\u201cToday is the day I will achieve victory over you Princess! You should know I have been practicing.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s funny so have I.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cdamn.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u2026</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cChat? Chat are you here?\u201d Marinette called poking her head up onto the Balcony, eyes scanning wildly for her feline companion.</p>\n<p>\u201cAt your service as always My Lady.\u201d Chat replied from the comfort of his black and green lawn chair.</p>\n<p>\u201cAAAAHHH!!!! Chat you are never going to believe what happened today!!!\u201d Marinette cried dancing around in happiness.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll believe it. I am pretty gullible after all.\u201d He smiled at her.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo this morning I was running late, which really isn\u2019t anything new to be honest, and when I got into class the teacher was scolding me about my horrible time management skills.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t sound like that great of a story so far.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh hush! I am getting to it. Anyways, so I was fairly humiliated over the whole thing, but a few minutes after I sat down Adrien dropped a note on my desk asking if I was ok! He wanted to make sure that I was ok!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI am glad to know your crush isn\u2019t a cretin.\u201d Chat replied lightly.</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course he isn\u2019t he is perfect, and that isn\u2019t even the best part.\u201d Marinette gushed.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe saga continues? I never would have guessed.\u201d Chat replied with the most obnoxious tone of fake surprise Marinette had ever heard. She chose to ignore her partner\u2019s sarcasm and instead pressed on.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo I wrote back that I was fine, I just was embarrassed that I can\u2019t ever get anywhere on time, and then he WROTE ME BACK! We ended up passing notes for the entire morning! I don\u2019t think I took a single note for class and I am going to have to beg Alya to let me copy her notes and I am sure she is going to tease me even worse than you are but I don\u2019t care!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou really are incredibly low maintenance aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd then he asked me to join him for lunch again.\u201d Marinette trailed off with a dreamy sigh, ignoring the way Chat was shaking his head in exasperated amusement. \u201cI think he might actually like me Chat.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s literally what I have been telling you this whole time.\u201d Chat drawled leaning back into his chair with a pout. \u201cAnd at no point in this story have I heard mention of you following through on our bet.\u201d</p>\n<p>Marinette had the decency to blush guiltily at his playful ire.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell after that he had to leave for a photoshoot but still! And Chloe was out sick so I didn\u2019t even have to worry about anyone spoiling it!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell I am glad your day went well.\u201d Chat mumbled quietly.</p>\n<p>\u201cHow about you? Was it a good day for the famous Chat Noir?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cParts of it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh? Is flirting and cat napping becoming too much for you Minou?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI will have you know I lead an incredibly busy and stressful life. You would weep for me Princess.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHa! Says the cat lazing about my balcony.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI find ways to relax every now and again.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell your days of lounging around my roof are coming to an end Chaton.\u201d She poked at his booted foot with her toe.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou could at least pretend like you will miss me Princess.\u201d Chat said with his usual trademark grin.</p>\n<p>Marinette was about to throw back a witty retort when she noticed that his cat ears were pressed flat against his head.</p>\n<p>Chat might have an excellent poker face under normal circumstances, but his feline appendages always betrayed him when he was truly upset. His day must have been terrible.</p>\n<p>\u201cMaybe if you\u2019re well behaved I\u2019ll still invited you to visit every now and then.\u201d She said, leaning down over him so that their noses were almost touching.</p>\n<p>Chat reached up and yanked her down so that she was lying on top of him, his arms loosely wrapped around her and she immediately snuggled into the comfortable embrace.</p>\n<p>It wasn\u2019t the first time they had ended up like this. With their close partnership physical contact had quickly become something they adjusted too. Even in their less action heavy encounters they would often touch and pet at each other in a way that would belie their very platonic relationship to a casual observer.</p>\n<p>Marinette had never really put much stock into the intimacy, it was just how they were. It had never crossed the boundaries of friendship even with Chat\u2019s constant flirting.</p>\n<p>But now she seemed to finally be on the verge of a real relationship with Adrien. Perhaps it wasn\u2019t such a good idea to be sprawled across her partner\u2019s chest. The last thing she wanted to do was give the impression that she was stringing on multiple boys.</p>\n<p>Chat must have felt her apprehension because he chuckled softly to himself, hugging her a little tighter.</p>\n<p>\u201cRelax Bugaboo. You aren\u2019t cheating on your scaredy-cat boyfriend by indulging me in some cuddling.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe isn\u2019t my boyfriend.\u201d She huffed, but she found herself relaxing into his arms. \u201cAnd he isn\u2019t a scaredy-cat! Where did that even come from?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh he is a total push-over. No self-confidence whatsoever.\u201d Chat teased, although his amused tone was softer than normal. \u201cWhy I bet that he has been pining after you for ages and never had the guts to do anything about it. Probably tried to come up with some insane convoluted scheme to get you to notice him all the while being too oblivious to see what was right in front of his face.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd how would you know?\u201d Marinette asked gently. Somehow, she knew that this wasn\u2019t just Chat making fun of a guy she liked. There was an underlying sadness to the usually cheerful voice that pulled on her heartstrings and made her question what life was like for her kitty on the other side of the mask.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s obvious. Terrible home life, lack of social skills, constant pressure to live up to a celebrity status? How could he be anything else?\u201d</p>\n<p>Chat had often been well versed in a lot of details about Adrien\u2019s life, rescuing him from numerous akuma attacks before she arrived and filling her in on his whereabouts and well-being on several occasions. It wasn\u2019t a hard conclusion to assume that they moved in similar social circles and were probably acquaintances or even friends.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Yet the hurt and insecurity in his voice was unmistakable. This wasn\u2019t a theoretical guess about a friend. Chat knew what it was like to feel that way too.</p>\n<p>Marinette had suspected for a while that Chat had an unhappy family life. Aside from several off handed comments during their various adventures, he had always seemed so awed by her own loving relationship with her parents.</p>\n<p>It broke her heart to think that of all the things that Chat and Adrien might share in common, it was a sense of loneliness.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou know I love you right Chat?\u201d She whispered, lifting her hand to run her fingers softly through her best friend\u2019s hair.</p>\n<p>He held her tighter.</p>\n<p>\u201cI love you too My Lady. Always.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u2026</p>\n<p>It was day three.</p>\n<p>Today was the day she was finally going to tell Adrien how she felt.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, opportunities thus far had been few and far between. Her efforts to get Adrien alone (or at least somewhere slightly more private) had been consistently thwarted by Chloe. Her blond nemesis had obviously been informed of Adrien\u2019s attention to her because the spoiled pest had clung to his side like a barnacle every second that wasn\u2019t spent doing actual lessons.</p>\n<p>Even Adrien\u2019s patience seemed to be wearing thin with his childhood friend, as his trademark smile had gradually fadled into what could more accurately be described as a frustrated grimace.</p>\n<p>Marinette had likewise found herself with an evil shadow, as Sabrina did her best to push and trip Marinette at every opportunity.</p>\n<p>Having learned from past experience, Marinette had made sure to enlist Alya\u2019s company anytime she needed to go anywhere on her own.</p>\n<p>Lunch had been a complete disaster, with Chloe obstinately inviting herself along when Adrien suggested going to a nearby caf\u00e9. Alya had violently protested the idea, but the ensuing argument had only lead to their other classmates coming over to ask about the commotion. Ultimately more than half the class ended up traipsing over to the nearby restaurant with Alya and Chloe bickering loudly all the while. Marinette was fairly confidant she hadn\u2019t managed to get a word in edgewise for the entire hour much less to Adrien, who had gotten trapped as the mediator in an argument between Nino and Kim over who the most dangerous Akuma to date had been. Personally she would have gone with Volpina. She still had nightmares about seeing Adrien dangling off the edge of the Eifel Tower, even if it had been an illusion.</p>\n<p>So that was how Marinette found herself at the end of the day an hour after classes had ended desperately hoping to catch Adrien after his fencing lesson. Alya and Nino, whom she had begged to allow her to postpone their scheduled trip to the arcade on the pretext of inviting Adrien, had wondered over to her parent\u2019s bakery in search of sweets while they waited. If she was lucky they would stay away long enough for her to confess to Adrien without an audience. Given Alya\u2019s unrepentant matchmaking, Marinette figured she should have at least 5 minutes of time alone with him once his lesson let out before either of her other friends put in an appearance.</p>\n<p>She gazed around the empty halls while she waited. They seemed so much larger without the hordes of students trekking to and from classes, only an abandoned janitors cart marring the sterile white expanse.</p>\n<p>She heard the repetitive tap tapping of footsteps from behind her and assumed that the custodian must had arrived to reclaim their supplies, when a cold, familiar laugh broke the silence into shards of dread.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, well, well. If it isn\u2019t little Marinette.\u201d Chloe drawled, coming around to circle her like a vulture inspecting a carcass of meat.\u00a0 \u201cDon\u2019t tell me you have finally progressed to full out stalking.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd what exactly are YOU doing here Chloe?\u201d Marinette spat back.</p>\n<p>\u201cI was finishing my physics project with Sabrina in the library and wanted to drop by and see if Adri-chou wanted to come by the hotel for dinner. After all, I am his closest friend.\u201d</p>\n<p>Marinette wondered which was the bigger falsehood in that statement- that Chloe had actually contributed to a project or that she was Adrien\u2019s closest friend? She almost wished that Nino was already back as she wouldn\u2019t have put it past him to slap Chloe in the face. The mental image made her smile.</p>\n<p>\u201cActually I am meeting Adrien so we can all go to the arcade.\u201d Marinette boasted, hoping to rub it in Chloe\u2019s face that Adrien had many, and better, options for socialization now than he did 2 years ago before he started public school.</p>\n<p>\u201cLiar.\u201d Chloe stated with a satisfied smile. \u201cAdrien has a rescheduled piano lesson today after fencing so there is no way he is going to have time to go out with you and your pathetic little crew tonight, which means at best you are hanging around here in the hope of asking him to join your little play date.\u201d</p>\n<p>Marinette felt her face flush.</p>\n<p>\u201cBut if all you cared about was asking him to slum it with the loser trio you could have done so via text. So the question becomes, Marinette Dupain-Cheng, what could be so important that you are idling around an empty hallway waiting desperately for my Adrien to come by?\u201d</p>\n<p>An Icy coldness settled in Marinette\u2019s veins and for the first time in years she found herself completely cowed by the daggers in Chloe\u2019s eyes and the Acid in her lilting tone.</p>\n<p>\u201cCould it be that you were planning on finally confessing your pointless crush?\u201d She said with false sweetness, a triumphant gleam in her eyes. \u201cWhy that must be it. Brava little Marinette, too bad it will all amount to nothing. But of course even you aren\u2019t so stupid that you don\u2019t know that, at least on some level.\u201d</p>\n<p>Marinette\u2019s throat went dry and she stood frozen, watching as Chloe perused the contents of the janitors cart beside them as if it was a department store cabinet.</p>\n<p>\u201cI know that it can be tempting to think, \u2018maybe I am special. Maybe Adrien will see me for the special little snowflake I am.\u2019 After all he is just so nice isn\u2019t he? He smiles at you, and he laughs at your stupid jokes and he listens to your stupid stories.\u201d Chloe\u2019s voice was smooth and calm, but the words burned and scratched at her soul. \u201cBut that\u2019s the problem Marinette Dupain-Cheng. He is nice to everyone. He would be just as attentive to a homeless stranger he met on the street. And the saddest thing is, you already know that everything I am saying is true.</p>\n<p>Yet somehow in the last few weeks you seem to have lost sight of the reality of your situation, so let me make this perfectly clear. You will never deserve him, you will never be good enough for him. And no matter how nice or sweet or considerate he might be to you out of some form of well-meaning if misplaced pity, he will NEVER love you the way you love him.\u201d</p>\n<p>And with a final flourish Chloe snatched up the uncapped bottle of cleaner she had been toying with and dumped it over Marinette.</p>\n<p>With a final chuckle, the blond turned on her heels and sauntered away in triumph.</p>\n<p>\u201cMarinette?\u201d</p>\n<p>She turned slowly at the sound of a familiar voice, cleaning fluid dripping from her hair and down her face as Adrien hurried to her side.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat on earth happened?\u201d He asked, as he took in her stained, sodden appearance with horror.</p>\n<p>\u201cChloe.\u201d Marinette managed to squeak out, her cheeks burning with humiliation. Adrien\u2019s entire posture sagged and he sighed in understanding.</p>\n<p>\u201cI am so sorry Marinette, I don\u2019t know why she does things like that.\u201d Adrien said. He pulled off his white over shirt and handed it out to her. \u201cHere, I know it won\u2019t fit, but at least it\u2019s clean. You can go change, I\u2019ll just wait out here.\u201d</p>\n<p>Marinette hurried into the nearby restroom and almost collapsed onto the sink.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh Marinette are you alright?\u201d Tikki cried, flying out of her bag and taking in the damage Chloe had caused.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah I\u2019m fine, it\u2019s just stains.\u201d Marinette replied, stripping off her ruined shirt and grabbing a handful of paper towels so that she could attempt to dry off her skin and hair.</p>\n<p>\u201cShe really is an awful piece of work isn\u2019t she?\u201d Tikki tutted, aiding as best she could with her tiny paws. \u201cDon\u2019t let it get you down Marinette, you know that nothing she said is true. Adrien adores you I know it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThanks Tikki.\u201d Marinette said fondly. However, her kwami\u2019s words could only do so much to ease to hallow chill of self-doubt that had lodged into the pit of her stomach.</p>\n<p>She quickly finished cleaning herself up as best as she could and changed into Adrien\u2019s too large shirt. She allowed herself a moment to indulge, pressing the fabric to her to her nose to breath in his scent. It was warm and comforting, much like the boy it belonged to, and she clung to the brief moment of contentment.</p>\n<p>With a final hug and a heartfelt \u201cI believe in you,\u201d from Tikki before she whipped back into her usual hiding place, Marinette squared her shoulders and headed back into the hallway.</p>\n<p>Adrien was waiting for her, pacing back and forth agitatedly like an irate jungle cat. He immediately halted when she let out a small cough, turning to inspect her for any lingering damage. He reached out a hand to touch her, but pulled back embarrassed.</p>\n<p>His obvious concern for her well being made her insides turn to mush, and her brain to wonder again how anyone could be so unendingly endearing. \u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThanks for the shirt.\u201d She said quietly, fingering the edges nervously and refusing to meet his eyes. \u201cI\u2019ll wash it tonight and get it back to you tomorrow I promise.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it.\u201d Adrien said gently. \u201cKeep it if you want, it looks better on you anyways.\u201d He ducked his head down so that she was forced to look at him before straitening, a shy happy smile tugging at the corners of his lips.</p>\n<p>Marinette\u2019s heart thudded in her chest.</p>\n<p>This was it, this was her moment to ask him. To win her bet with Chat.</p>\n<p>Screw her bet with Chat, she didn\u2019t care if she had to give him croissants for the rest of her life. This was something so much bigger than that. This was her chance to ask out the boy of her dreams, a boy that she had been desperately in love with for 2 years. A boy who was kind and thoughtful and who made her feel like everything she did or said was somehow important. It was her chance to finally get everything she ever wanted.</p>\n<p>Marinette stared up at him but no words were forming. Her throat felt tight and her knees were weak. Why couldn\u2019t she do this? It was just a simple sentence, <em>will you go out with me</em>? She opened her mouth but no sound came out, not even an incomprehensible squeal.</p>\n<p>She could hear Chloe\u2019s words rattling around in her head, magnifying her own fears as she gazed up at Adrien. He was so close she could feel the warmth of his skin and hear the even rise and fall of his breath. \u00a0His brilliant green eyes flickered with emotions as he waited for her to speak.</p>\n<p>She swallowed hard and opened her mouth again but it was no use. Her entire body shook as she realized that she couldn\u2019t do it. She couldn\u2019t block out the fear and the doubt. She couldn\u2019t ask him.</p>\n<p>She could feel the tears welling up in her eyes, as Adrien still stood in front of her waiting patiently for her to do or say anything. The look on his face was a soft, fond expression, and Marinette had the feeling that he would have stood there waiting for the entire day so as not to make her feel abandoned or unappreciated. But she could also see the hints of worry and confusion dancing in his eyes, and perhaps even a touch of disappointment.</p>\n<p>She was such a failure. He deserved so much better than this. Than a girl who could barely function in his presence, than a girl who was so scared of not being with him that she couldn\u2019t even fight for what she wanted.</p>\n<p>It was like her first akuma battle all over again, only this time Chat wasn\u2019t here to reassure her that everything was going to be ok.</p>\n<p>Maybe Chloe was right after all.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2026 I\u2026\u201d She finally stammered out. Her eyes were now swimming with unshed tears and even through the blur she could see Adrien\u2019s expression had morphed into a look of genuine concern. \u201cI can\u2019t\u2026\u201d She squeaked out trying to will her mouth to work, her eyes to close and block out the sudden look of understanding on his face, or maybe for her legs to carry her out of the school and as far away as possible. Maybe her ladybug luck would kick in and Chat could come bursting in through the window and carry her away from her humiliation, it seemed like the sort of melodramatic thing he would do.</p>\n<p>\u201cI have to go.\u201d She finally managed to say, but she was still frozen in place unable to move or to look away from Adrien\u2019s concerned, remorseful expression as the first tear finally spilled down the side of her cheek.</p>\n<p>Adrien reached forward and pulled her into a crushing hug, arms wrapped around her back, her chest pressed against his.</p>\n<p>\u201cI am so sorry.\u201d He said gently. \u201cThis is all my fault, I didn\u2019t think. Please forgive me.\u201d</p>\n<p>He must have figured out that Chloe was tormenting her because of him. And now here he was apologized for what? For being desirable? For being the object of their affections? For not preemptively riding the world of Chloe and her sycophant minion?</p>\n<p>She couldn\u2019t stop the muffled cries that clawed their way out of her throat as the tears began to fall in earnest. She would never deserve him, she would never be good enough, and he would never love her the way she loved him.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh Mari.\u201d Adrien sighed, \u201cIts ok. I promise everything is going to be ok.\u201d He squeezed her more tightly, laying his cheek against her head as he rubbed soft circles against her back.</p>\n<p>Marinette allowed herself to be held by him, too selfish and too in love not to indulge in the embrace while she had the chance, as she sobbed into his designer tee shirt.</p>\n<p>\u2026</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Marinette didn\u2019t know if she was relieved or disappointed that Chat was nowhere to be found when she stumbled up to her room a half hour later.</p>\n<p>No more than a few minutes after Adrien had pulled her into his arms Alya and Nino had found them and had begun immediately fussing over her. However, before they could even find out what had happened, Chloe and Sabrina had materialized as well, most likely looking for Adrien. Chloe had smiled at Marinette\u2019s distress, letting out a patronizing giggle and clearly preparing to launch into round 2 of her verbal assault.</p>\n<p>In what might have been the most aggressive act any of them had ever seen from the mild mannered Adrien, he had grabbed both Chloe and her henchwoman by the arm and dragged them off down the hallway and out to Chloe\u2019s waiting limo before she had gotten a complete sentence out. His cold scathing condemnation of her recent behavior echoed in the mostly empty hallway, but the words barely registered to Marinette through her continued weeping. \u00a0Alya and Nino had looked after the departing trio in shock, Nino letting out a soft whistle of approval.</p>\n<p>Both of her friends had tried to pry out an explanation for what had happened, but Marinette really didn\u2019t want to try explaining anything about her failed attempts, Adrien\u2019s unattainability, or her bet with Chat, so she merely shook her head and tried to control her tears. Adrien had never returned from depositing Chloe, most likely his driver had herded him into his own car and carted him off to the safety of the Agreste mansion.</p>\n<p>Eventually they had all made their way to Marinette\u2019s where she had endured another round of fussing by her mother, who had not been oblivious to her red rimmed eyes or her change in shirt. At this point she had calmed down enough to throw together a brief explanation for her distress, largely focused on her confrontation with Chloe while glossing over the details of exactly why the blonde\u2019s behavior had been so particularly ill timed.</p>\n<p>After Marinette had begged for some space to recover and sleep it off, her well-meaning friends and parents had hurried her up the stairs and headed back to their own activities with numerous promises to check on her later.</p>\n<p>Having found her room empty of any visitors, Marinette abandoned all pretenses of recovery and crawled up to her bed determined to cry herself out.</p>\n<p>Two hours, one shower, and 3 attempted pep talks from Tikki later, Marinette had finally managed to ebb the flow of tears. Just in time to hear the soft timid knock against her skylight.</p>\n<p>Chat was peering down at her, a forelorn expression on his face and a giant dufflebag of something under his arm.</p>\n<p>Marinette nodded him, granting him permission to enter, but remained curled in her bed. She had earned some quality wallowing time and she knew Chat well enough to know that he would most likely indulge her.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey Princess.\u201d He said hesitantly, carefully climbing down onto the loft beside her.</p>\n<p>\u201cI take it you heard about today?\u201d She asked, not bothering to dance around the subject.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah.\u201d He ducked his head unhappily. No terrible pun, no enigmatic statement about how he learns so much about her life. Just a single word of acknowledgement. He clearly understood how heartbroken she was. It almost made her feel worse.</p>\n<p>Marinette didn\u2019t say anything, she just stared at the defeated looking boy next to her, taking comfort from his presence and his sympathy.</p>\n<p>\u201cI brought you something.\u201d He said at last, shifting to open the dufflebag he had brought with him.</p>\n<p>Marinette\u2019s eyes began to water again, but this time in awed gratitude as Chat pulled out a very large and undoubtedly very expensive bouquet of pink and white flowers. She reached up and accepted the gift, propping herself on her pillows so she could cradle the beautiful arrangement to her chest, inhaling the calming fragrance.</p>\n<p>She was about to thank her friend for such a thoughtful gesture when she felt the soft pressure of something being dropped onto her blanketed lap. Another followed.</p>\n<p>Marinette\u2019s eyes widened as Chat began pulling dozens of small gifts out of the dufflebag and piling them hastily onto her bed. A box of chocolates, a small cat plush, some Dvds, a tub of ice cream\u2026 good grief was that a jewelry box?</p>\n<p>\u201cChat what are you doing? What is all of this?\u201d Marinette gaped in stupefied wonder at the pile of goodies. It was like he had sat down with a list of every Rom-com clich\u00e9 that you could purchase at a department store.</p>\n<p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know what you wanted!\u201d He shouted, clearly embarrassed by his ignorance. \u201cIf you upset a girl you have to buy her things, and I didn\u2019t know what to get you!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWho on earth told you that?\u201d Marinette asked, horrified.</p>\n<p>\u201cCl- a close friend of mine.\u201d He stammered.</p>\n<p>\u201cYour friend is a terrible person.\u201d She replied, still taking in the several hundred dollars of worth of gifts.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat is a popular theory.\u201d Chat muttered, slouching into the corner of her loft.</p>\n<p>He looked so miserable. He poor clueless kitten. Marinette felt her own misery withering away in light of his kindness and concern. She reached out and batted at the golden bell on his collar playfully. He looked up at her for a moment but quickly turned away.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou really didn\u2019t have to do all of this minou.\u201d She said softly.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes I did. It\u2019s my fault you\u2019re upset. I never should have pushed you to take this stupid bet.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that, I am glad you did.\u201d</p>\n<p>Chat did look at her then, his expression startled, mouth hanging open in an adorable pout.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat? Why?\u201d <br> \u201cDon\u2019t you get it Chat? I have made more progress in my attempts to talk to Adrien in the past 3 days than I have in the past 2 years, and that is because of you. You have always been the person who makes it possible for me to be strong, to be brave. Without you I would never have become ladybug, and without you I never would have found the courage to even try to go after Adrien, not really. You bring out everything good and powerful and amazing in me, and I don\u2019t know what I would do without you. I am the one who is letting you down Chat. You see so much in me that I just can\u2019t ever be without you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Chat stared at her, his eyes full of so much love and gratitude that she thought she might start crying all over again.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh My Lady. You will always have me, but I hope someday you will believe me when I tell you there is nothing that I see in you that isn\u2019t already there. Even when you are at your worst you could never let me down.\u201d</p>\n<p>If only she had fallen in love with him instead.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo.\u201d Marinette looked away shyly, \u201cI guess this means you get to kiss me now.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI suppose so.\u201d Chat replied lightly. \u201cBut I don\u2019t really make a habit of kissing emotional distraught girls.\u201d He gave her a deliberate wink, his cocky grin back in force.</p>\n<p>\u201cAlways the gentleman.\u201d Marinette laughed a little and leaned into her partner, taking comfort in his steadfast support.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, maybe not always.\u201d He teased, wiggling his eyebrows for effect and pulling the first genuine smile out of her all afternoon.</p>\n<p>Chat kissed her chastely on the top of her forehead.\u00a0 \u201cThere is the smile I live for.\u201d He said softly.</p>\n<p>\u2026</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cMarinette?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGAHHH!!\u201d Marinette startled awake at the sight of Chat peering at her from her skylight. \u201cWhat are you doing here?? What time is it?\u201d She spluttered, thanking every star in the heavens that she had decided to sleep in a tee shirt and sweatpants and not one of her more revealing nightgowns.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s 7:30, shouldn\u2019t you already be up for school? Class starts in an hour.\u201d Chat looked genuinely confused by her sleepy state.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, which means I could have had another half an hour of sleep you worthless cat!\u201d Marinette grumbled.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou only get up 30 minutes before class?\u201d He ask, looking genuinely confused.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t I? I live right next door!\u201d Marinette whined. \u201cIt\u2019s not like it takes that long to get ready in the morning. I mean how early do you usually get up before leaving for your school.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c6:00.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo wonder you are so crazy. I suddenly have a whole new appreciation for your terrible taste in humor, you poor sleep deprived kitten.\u201d Marinette sighed, pulling the blankets around her and snuggling back into the bed.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey, none of that now!\u201d Chat chided. Flipping down into the room and yanking her covers away cruelly. \u201cSOMEONE owes me a croissant, and I went through a lot of trouble this morning to collect it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh how awful for you. I weep for your pain.\u201d Marinette drawled sarcastically, glaring at the pile of comforter held captive in her partner\u2019s arms.</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry princess I have an idea for a much more effective delivery system.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo why don\u2019t we just use that and I can go back to sleep.\u201d She moaned.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt won\u2019t work yet. There is something I need to do first.\u201d He said jovially.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou make no sense.\u201d Marinette sighed, but she forced herself up and began climbing down her ladder to fetch her partner the promised prize. After all a deal was a deal.</p>\n<p>To say that her parents were shocked to see her up and about before the usual game of begging and bribing to leave her bed was an understatement.</p>\n<p>\u201cMaman do we have any croissants?\u201d Marinette asked, looking about the bakery but unwilling to venture into the front sales room still in her pajamas.</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t know dear. We may be sold out until the next batch. They were surprisingly popular today. Do you want me to set one aside for you for breakfast?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo that\u2019s ok.\u201d Marinette said, grabbing a pain au chocolate and heading back up to the stairs. \u201cI just need something to snack on while I finish up a project before school.\u201d</p>\n<p>She trudged her way back up to her room.</p>\n<p>\u201cHere.\u201d She said dropping the plate in front of Chat, who had migrated down to her chaise.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat is not a croissant.\u201d Chat said flatly.</p>\n<p>He continued to scowl at her as he picked up the sugary concoction and devoured it in several large hungry bites.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt didn\u2019t stop you from eating it. So I say it counts.\u201d Marinette retorted, sitting down at her computer. As long as she was up she might as well actually get some work done.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell of course I am going to eat it, but I was promised a croissant. I have been dying to try one of them since\u2026\u201d He trailed off in a cough. \u201cNever mind. But don\u2019t think you are off the hook Buginette.\u201d</p>\n<p>Marinette sighed. \u201cI\u2019ll make sure to put one aside for you and you can come by and grab it tonight.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cExcellent!\u201d Chat beamed. Marinette couldn\u2019t repress the small smile that came to her lips. He really did get excited about the smallest things.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo don\u2019t you need to get headed off to your school?\u201d Marinette asked, looking over at Chat.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve got some time.\u201d He smiled. Hopping up and coming over to examine the assignment she was working on. \u201cYou got number 6 wrong.\u201d</p>\n<p>Marinette was about to protest but out of curiosity she went back and examined the problem.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh. Thanks.\u201d</p>\n<p>For the next 20 minutes or so she proceeded to work on her assignment while Chat hovered over her shoulder. He nodded along encouragingly whenever she had trouble working through an answer and calmly pointed out any errors. It was nice, she realized, having him around. Despite his corrections he never scolded or tried to tell her the answers, instead trusting her to fix the problems on her own.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re rather good at this kitty.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat, Maths?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, that too, but I meant being a study partner. My friend Alya is a nightmare for this kind of thing. If you don\u2019t get the answer as quickly as she does she will either try to just do it for you or complain about how obvious it is. It drives all of us crazy. I swear Adrien is the only one who doesn\u2019t want to throttle her during study sessions. Although it might be that he\u2019s just too polite to show it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Chat chuckled. \u201cI have a friend who is just like that.\u201d He leaned down and wrapped his arms around her, both sets of eyes still locked onto the computer screen. \u201cI am glad you are feeling better. You had me worried yesterday.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t know why I let Chloe get to me. It was stupid.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t stupid My Lady. Sometimes the hardest thing in the world is being honest with the people you care about the most.\u201d Chat said softly.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy do you say that?\u201d Marinette asked, turning her head slightly to look at her partner, their noses almost brushing.</p>\n<p>\u201cBecause their opinions matter more.\u201d He replied. Tilting his head to face her as well.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell I should get going.\u201d Chat gave her a friendly squeeze before straightening up and climbing up her loft towards her skylight. \u201cDon\u2019t forget you still owe me a kiss bugaboo.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHow could I possibly forget!\u201d Marinette laughed, waving goodbye to her friend as he climbed out onto the roof.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey Chat?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes My Lady?\u201d He poked his head back through the trapdoor.</p>\n<p>\u201cI know that the bet is over,\u201d she began nervously, \u201cbut I think I am going to try again anyways.\u201d She could feel a soft blush spreading across her cheeks as she met her partner\u2019s surprised gaze. \u201cI was kind of hoping that you could, maybe, wish me luck?\u201d She gave him a sheepish smile.</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t think you WANT my luck My Lady.\u201d Chat said with his trademark Cheshire grin. \u201cBesides, you don\u2019t need it. You can accomplish anything you set your mind to Marinette. I\u2019ve always believed that.\u201d And with that he disappeared in a flurry of blonde hair and glistening white teeth.</p>\n<p>\u2026</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>You can do this, you CAN do this. Marinette chanted to herself as she made her way towards the school half an hour later.</p>\n<p>She could see most of her class milling around the front entrance, not wanting to venture into the building until absolutely necessary. Neither Chloe nor Sabrina were in the crowd to her intense relief, but there standing on the top steps like a beacon of sunshine was\u2026</p>\n<p>\u201cAdrien!\u201d She blurted out before she could lose her nerve.</p>\n<p>He turned towards her, ignoring whatever conversation he had been having with Nino and Alya and smiled at her.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey Marinette. Nice to see you this early.\u201d He winked at her, and Marinette fought desperately to stay upright. She was going to do this. She was.</p>\n<p>\u201cI was hoping that I could talk to you about something.\u201d She said, managing to keep her voice steady by looking everywhere but at the boy she was addressing.</p>\n<p>\u201cSure, did you want to go somewhere? We have a little time before class if\u2026\u201d <br> </p>\n<p>\u201cNO!\u201d She shouted, instantly feeling like the world\u2019s biggest idiot when she saw him back away startled. \u201cI mean here is fine, I mean it\u2019s as fine as it\u2019s going to be I just need to tell you and if I don\u2019t say it now then I won\u2019t and then I will just be giving away croissants for no reason and\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMarinette are you feeling alright?\u201d Alya interjected, looking worriedly at her best friend.</p>\n<p>\u201cI am fine! I just need to say this!\u201d She slammed her eyes shut and dove in. \u201cI mean, Adrien, you might not want to but that\u2019s ok, because at least I will know right? And that\u2019s ok because we are friends and no matter what we will still be friends because you are one of the greatest people I know and that\u2019s why I have to say it because otherwise it will never happen, because I was the scaredy cat not you, never you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOk is she having a stroke or something?\u201d Nino stage whispered to Alya and Marinette made a mental note to smack him later, sometime when her heart wasn\u2019t trying to leap out of her throat.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo, what I mean to say is\u2026\u201d She took a deep breath, \u201cWILLYOUGOOUTWITHME?\u201d</p>\n<p>YES!</p>\n<p>She opened her eyes and saw Alya and Nino\u2019s dumbfounded looks but they were insignificant to Adrien\u2019s joyous, proud expression. He was smiling at her. Not his usual soft smile that made him so popular to photographers, but a wide toothy grin that was both strange and achingly familiar.</p>\n<p>Without any more warning Adrien pulled her towards him and covered her lips in a deep, searing kiss.</p>\n<p>He was kissing her! Not some innocent peck on the lips, not a tentative pressing of lips. No, this kiss was hard and hungry. He kissed her like she was water and he was dying of thirst, he kissed her with a ferocity that made her knees buckle and her limbs shake, melting into a helpless mewling puddle in his arms. He kissed her like he loved her.</p>\n<p>It was everything she had ever dreamed it could be and so much more.</p>\n<p>She knew that around her people were reacting. You can\u2019t just start making out with the hottest guy in existence in front of most of your class without some sort of reaction, but somehow nothing registered. It was as though she and Adrien were trapped in a perfect bubble of existence where nothing was real except the feeling of his lips against hers.</p>\n<p>She was drowning in sensations. She could smell his cologne mixed with that ever present sent of cheese that he always seems to carry. She could feel the soft texture of his hair against her fingers, although she had no idea when her arms had managed to wrap around his neck. She could taste the lingering traces of sugar and chocolate that clung to his mouth from the pastry he had eaten earlier\u2026 wait\u2026</p>\n<p>\u201cYou still owe me a croissant My Lady.\u201d He whispered as she gasp for air.</p>\n<p>Marinette\u2019s startled cry was silenced as his mouth once again descended to claim hers.</p>"
