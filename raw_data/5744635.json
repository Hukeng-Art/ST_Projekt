  "text": "<p>The train ride to King\u2019s Cross was a stony, silent affair. Draco sat next to him, on the grounds that \u201cat least that way I don\u2019t have to <em>look</em> at you,\u201d which suited Harry fine, but Crabbe had taken Draco\u2019s other side, and Goyle and Ron and Hermione were opposite them, all of them glaring and being glared-at and fingering their wands, so it didn\u2019t really help all that much. Nobody said a word until the tea trolley came past. \u201cAnything for you, loveys?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNot unless you have a bottle of Infilcher\u2019s Insensibility Draught,\u201d Draco said. His arm and shoulder were a rigid straight line, pressed up all against Harry\u2019s equally stiff one. It felt horribly nice. Every few moments Harry had to catch himself before he relaxed into it.</p>\n<p>Harry had never been <em>glad</em> to get home before, and he still wasn\u2019t, but it was at least a temporary relief when the train finally ground into the station and they had to get up and get their trunks down. Draco\u2019s was double-height, but spelled with so many Featherlight charms it nearly floated: he stalked out ahead of Harry and started marching down the platform without a pause. Harry gritted his teeth. It was like having a string tied around his guts, trying to drag them out of him. He held position and turned round determinedly. \u201cHave a good holiday,\u201d he told Ron and Hermione, who were watching him anxiously.</p>\n<p>They didn\u2019t say <em>you too</em>. \u201cDo be careful, Harry,\u201d Hermione said.</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t close your eyes for a second,\u201d Ron added. \u201cI don\u2019t trust that rotter one inch.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s not like he can hurt Harry right now,\u201d Hermione said.</p>\n<p>\u201cIf anyone can find a way round that, it\u2019s Malfoy,\u201d Ron said darkly.</p>\n<p>\u201cIf he <em>did</em> find a way round this, I wouldn\u2019t <em>care</em>,\u201d Harry said. Hermione bit her lip and stepped forward and hugged him.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not for long,\u201d she said. \u201cBy the time we get back to Hogwarts, the Unfettering Brew will be ready.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cListen to you!\u201d Ron said. \u201cHe\u2019s got to get through a month with the Dursleys and a month at <em>Malfoy Manor</em>. With <em>Draco Malfoy</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, thanks,\u201d Harry said, because he hadn\u2019t just spent the last week contemplating just how much more horrible his summer holidays were about to be than they\u2019d ever been before. He took a deep breath. The string was still tugging, a tight sore pain starting in the middle of his back. \u201cSee you,\u201d he said, and turned around to catch up. Draco had halted maybe ten yards on, his back rigid and furious. Crabbe and Goyle were looking at him sideways, like they didn\u2019t dare even speak.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis way,\u201d Harry muttered, dragging his own trunk past. Up ahead, kids were running off the platform to their mums and dads, everyone hugging and laughing and talking at once, a happy crowded noise. Uncle Vernon was waiting at the back, scowling and arms folded across his chest. Harry had been sure the Dursleys wouldn\u2019t have Draco\u2014he\u2019d had a bad few days thinking he\u2019d have the <em>entire summer</em> with the Malfoys\u2014but Dumbledore had somehow talked them into it. Of course, it was maybe even more hideous that Harry had to be glad for spending any time with the Dursleys. He was really looking forward to a whole summer getting to decide which was worse.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, come on,\u201d Uncle Vernon growled, when they got up to him, and turned around and stalked off to the car without a pause. Harry followed him, then glanced back: Draco had slowed down. He was looking searchingly around the crowd, like he expected to see somebody.</p>\n<p>\u201cBye, Draco,\u201d Goyle said a bit uncertainly, going past him with his own dad.</p>\n<p>Draco only gave him a chin-jerk of a nod, then turned away from the platform, his lips pressed together. He didn\u2019t say anything the whole ride to Little Whinging, sitting in the back seat next to Harry and staring straight ahead as though he wasn\u2019t seeing anything around him. Uncle Vernon led the way into the house and on to the living room, where Aunt Petunia was sitting on the sofa waiting for them, her face primmed up into tight disapproval.</p>\n<p>\u201cNow then,\u201d Uncle Vernon said, turning to face them. \u201cYou may be sure I wouldn\u2019t have stood still for this outrageous imposition, if it didn\u2019t mean we\u2019d have our August holiday without you. That\u2019s worth having to put up with <em>two</em> of you freaks in the house for a month. But I intend to make it perfectly clear from the outset that we will have <em>none</em> of your funny business around here. No tricks, no waving around those rotten little sticks of yours. None of it!\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry rolled his eyes privately. \u201cYes, Uncle Vernon.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd you,\u201d Uncle Vernon added, looming over Draco, who blinked as if he were coming awake and very slowly turned his head to stare up at him. \u201cI don\u2019t know what sort of jiggery pokery you\u2019re used to getting away with at home, but I won\u2019t have it in my house. Is that understood?\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco stared up at him a moment longer, and then said, in amazed tones, \u201cPotter, is this filthy Muggle kenneller of yours <em>speaking to me</em>?\u201d</p>\n<p>Uncle Vernon gawked down at him, and Harry had one appalled moment to realize things were going to go even worse than he\u2019d ever dreamed, and then Draco was advancing on Uncle Vernon, drawing his wand out of his sleeve. \u201cListen very carefully, <em>worm</em>,\u201d he said through his teeth. \u201cI don\u2019t know what sort of behavior Potter lets you get away with, but <em>I</em> am not a pathetic Muggle-loving excuse of a wizard. It\u2019s bad enough I have to spend half of my holidays in this wretched hovel,\u201d waving his arm around the living room, taking in the marble fireplace and the two massive sofas and the sixty-inch telly, \u201cenduring Merlin knows what sort of hellish conditions. I will <em>not</em> tolerate disrespect. For as long as I am gracing your home with my presence, you will do your best to keep out of my way, and when you speak to me, which should be as infrequently as your duties permit, you will address me as <em>Master Malfoy</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy you little\u2014\u201d Uncle Vernon spluttered, his face reddening. \u201cYou can\u2019t put anything over on <em>us</em>, you aren\u2019t allowed to use magic\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco laughed, high and sharp and cutting. \u201cOh, did Potter go off half-cocked and get a finger-wagging from the Ministry? Don\u2019t be stupid.\u201d He jabbed his wand up under Uncle Vernon\u2019s chin, sparks spilling off the end, backing him up to the sofa until he fell backwards into it with a yelp and a squeaking of springs, Aunt Petunia clutching at his shoulders. \u201c<em>I</em> won\u2019t suffer any consequences if I have to use magic to teach you proper respect. My parents will file a self-defense exemption with the Head of the Improper Use of Magic Office, we\u2019ll meet with him at our solicitor\u2019s office, I\u2019ll apologize very sincerely for having been <em>forced</em> to turn you and your family into red-tailed salamanders, then we\u2019ll all shake hands and there will be an end of it.\u201d</p>\n<p>He whisked his wand back into his sleeve and straightened up. \u201cNow take my trunk up to my rooms,\u201d he spat, \u201cand if they aren\u2019t suitable, you will make them so before dinnertime. Potter! Where do you go to fly around here?\u201d</p>\n<p>He whirled on his heel and held out his hand for his broomstick, which jumped into it, and stalked back out to the hall. Harry stared after him, then looked back at the Dursleys. Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia were still shrinking deep into the sofa. \u201cUm,\u201d Harry said. \u201cI\u2019ve\u2014got to go with him.\u201d He took a step backwards towards the door cautiously, half feeling as though the whole room was a bomb that might go off. He backed up another step, then another, and then he was safely out of sight in the hall.</p>\n<p>He\u2019d left his trunk at the foot of the stairs, Hedwig\u2019s cage on top. She hooted inquiringly at him. \u201cYeah,\u201d Harry said to her. \u201cI don\u2019t know what just happened either.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPotter, is there some inconceivable reason you\u2019re <em>lingering</em> in this shack?\u201d Draco snapped from the porch.</p>\n<p>Harry rolled his eyes. \u201cThere\u2019s nowhere to go flying, Malfoy! The whole neighborhood is full of Muggles, we\u2019ll be seen for sure.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t be an idiot. There\u2019s cloud cover not three hundred feet up, it\u2019s legal conditions. What\u2019s the matter, scared you\u2019ll fall off?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNot before <em>you</em> will,\u201d Harry shot back, but fine, it wasn\u2019t like he <em>wanted</em> to stay in the house. He took Hedwig out of her cage\u2014he didn\u2019t trust the Dursleys with her for a second if his back was turned\u2014and took his broomstick to the door. Draco was impatiently tossing a gold ball in his hand up and down. \u201cYou\u2019ve got a Snitch!\u201d Harry said.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat, you haven\u2019t?\u201d Draco said sneeringly. \u201c<em>Will</em> you come on?\u201d</p>\n<p>#</p>\n<p>They came back to the house four hours later, when it finally got too dark to see the Snitch. Harry had caught it twelve times and Draco nine, they\u2019d nearly fallen off a dozen times between them, and he\u2019d accidentally worked out a brilliant looping trick that you could only do because the Firebolt\u2019s foot grips let you keep traction even in a twisting dive. When they came in, their trunks <em>had</em> been taken upstairs, there wasn\u2019t any sign of the Dursleys at all\u2014Harry could see a light coming from under their bedroom door at the top of the stairs, but it was shut tight\u2014and there were plates keeping warm in the oven.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat is that monstrosity?\u201d Draco said, going straight past the kitchen and dropping himself into the chair at the head of Aunt Petunia\u2019s polished dining table. He jerked his chin.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s an epergne,\u201d Harry said, sitting down with his own plate. He wasn\u2019t going to bloody well serve Malfoy.</p>\n<p>\u201cI can see it\u2019s <em>meant</em> to be an epergne,\u201d Draco said. He scowled over at Harry\u2019s plate and then got up and went and got his own. \u201cWhy is it sitting on the table? It\u2019s putting me off my dinner.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt was a wedding present,\u201d Harry said. He\u2019d heard a lot of bragging on the subject from Aunt Petunia whenever a new guest came to the house, not to mention the lectures to keep his grubby hands off it. \u201cIt cost five hundred pounds.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, I can <em>tell</em>,\u201d Draco said, except he made it sneering. \u201cWhat a ghastly life you lead, Potter. I suppose you eat this sort of common swill every night, too?\u201d</p>\n<p>He tucked in pretty enthusiastically, for all his claims of delicacy. Both plates were full of lamb shank and mashed potatoes and stewed mushrooms and green beans. Harry hadn\u2019t eaten anything like it at the Dursleys\u2019 table his entire life except as cold table scraps: it had to be the special dinner Aunt Petunia had been planning to welcome Dudley back tomorrow. They both cleaned their plates, and there was even a cheesecake in the fridge, which Malfoy commandeered without hesitation. Harry hadn\u2019t ever tasted a piece of Aunt Petunia\u2019s cheesecake, either: she always took a slice, and then Dudley and Vernon gobbled all the rest, moaning about how wonderful it was.</p>\n<p>It <em>was</em> fantastic. Even Draco said, grudgingly, \u201cThat was adequate, at least. Now, where are my rooms?\u201d pushing his dirty plates back.</p>\n<p>\u201cFirst there\u2019s the washing up,\u201d Harry said pointedly, because he wasn\u2019t going to clean up after Malfoy, either, but Draco sniffed.</p>\n<p>\u201cIf your family are so poverty-stricken they can\u2019t afford to keep a decent servant, it\u2019s nothing to do with <em>me</em>,\u201d and he stood up and headed for the stairs.</p>\n<p>Harry looked down at the plates, but the <em>pull</em> was tugging him along, and anyway he was sure Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon would shriek if Draco came into their room by accident. He followed Draco upstairs. \u201cStraight ahead,\u201d Harry said, and Draco opened the door to the spare bedroom and stood on the threshold surveying the big king-size bed and the heavy wood furniture and the expensive carpet with an expression of disgust.</p>\n<p>\u201cUgh, it\u2019s unbearable,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is where you sleep?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, I sleep over here,\u201d Harry said dryly, opening the door to his room across the landing. Draco looked even more appalled after a glance inside.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou might as well live in a cupboard,\u201d he said. \u201cHonestly, Potter, I\u2019m almost starting to feel <em>sorry</em> for you.\u201d He swept into the spare room.</p>\n<p>Harry looked longingly over at his room\u2014his own room, small or not, with no Draco Malfoy in it. The bedrooms weren\u2019t <em>that</em> far apart. He tried going inside and sitting down on the bed for a minute, just to see\u2014</p>\n<p>It was no use. The tugging wasn\u2019t that bad at first, but it just <em>kept going</em>. He sighed and got up. Uncle Vernon had left Harry\u2019s trunk pushed just inside his door, but it wasn\u2019t hard to shove it along the hall and into Malfoy\u2019s room. Draco was already changing, into a long black nightshirt, trimmed in silver. He scowled as Harry came in, but didn\u2019t say anything: he\u2019d felt it, too.</p>\n<p>\u201cIf you kick, I\u2019ll shove you off the bed,\u201d he informed Harry as they got into bed.</p>\n<p>Harry rolled his eyes. \u201c<em>Night</em>, Malfoy,\u201d he said, pointedly, and shut off the light.</p>\n<p>His eyes were closing even on the way down, and they didn\u2019t open again until the sun came in and hit him in the face, at which point he woke up feeling absolutely fantastic and <em>cuddling Draco Malfoy</em>.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh <em>no</em>,\u201d Harry said, appalled, which made Draco wake up.</p>\n<p>\u201cTomorrow you\u2019re sleeping on the floor!\u201d Draco said, glaring at him from the other side of the bed after they\u2019d scrambled out in opposite directions.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve got a better idea, why don\u2019t <em>you</em> sleep on the floor,\u201d Harry fired back.</p>\n<p>Draco made a face. \u201cIt can\u2019t really be much worse than this <em>bed</em>. Do your loving relations stick Bruising Peas under the mattress or something?\u201d</p>\n<p>Aunt Petunia was already in the kitchen frying bacon; she jumped nervously, eyes darting at Draco, when they came in. \u201cI prefer my eggs shirred,\u201d Draco informed her. \u201cDon\u2019t overcook the bacon. Where\u2019s the <em>Daily Prophet?</em>\u201d he asked Harry, then sulkily took the <em>Times</em> from where it was waiting at Uncle Vernon\u2019s place and sat down in his chair with it, muttering about ignorant Muggles.</p>\n<p>Harry looked between him and Aunt Petunia, half fascinated. She hesitated and opened her mouth to speak. Then Draco looked up from the paper and frowned at the teapot, already on the table. It jerked out from under its cozy, floated over to his place, and poured him a cup. The milk and sugar trundled over to help.</p>\n<p>Aunt Petunia went to the fridge and got out the eggs and cream. She made some for Harry, too, and for once he even got bacon.</p>\n<p>\u201cHow\u2019d you do that, with the teapot?\u201d he said to Draco, after they\u2019d gone out with their brooms again.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDo what?\u201d Draco said.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou made the teapot pour!\u201d Harry said.</p>\n<p>Draco looked at him as if he were deranged. \u201cThat\u2019s what teapots <em>do</em>, Potter. Pour tea.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUsually you have to pick ours up with your hands,\u201d Harry said.</p>\n<p>Draco sniffed. \u201cYou\u2019ve no one to blame but yourself if your crockery is undisciplined, Potter. Naturally the dishes will take advantage of you if you let them sit around getting lazy.\u201d</p>\n<p>It was another overcast day. They shot up over the low cloud layer into brilliant sunshine and spent the morning racing. Harry won the sprints, but Draco had the edge at distance, even though his Nimbus was a bit slower: he knew all sorts of ways to coax his broom along.</p>\n<p>At lunchtime, Harry surreptitiously tried frowning at the salt cellar, but it didn\u2019t do anything. Draco noticed, naturally. He sniggered and then crooked a finger at it, and the cellar slid right across the table to his plate and sprinkled his potatoes.</p>\n<p>The sky had cleared by the time they had finished: no more flying. \u201cWhat else do you <em>do</em> in this miserable slum?\u201d Malfoy said, contemplating the length of Privet Drive with all its neat and tidy houses.</p>\n<p>\u201cI mostly spend it inside my room reading,\u201d Harry said. Usually he was locked in, anyway. \u201cThere\u2019s a park down by Magnolia Crescent.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIs there anything interesting in it?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUm. No,\u201d Harry said. \u201cIt\u2019s just a park.\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco was deeply unenthusiastic. There wasn\u2019t much other choice, though, so they walked down anyway. They stopped by the pond and he chucked stones at it irritably, skipping them a dozen times at a go. It was getting hot with the sun out. Dragonflies buzzed, and Harry yawned and stretched out on his back on the grass. After a while, Draco sighed and lay down next to him, arms brushing. A steady glow of warmth and comfort radiated out through Harry\u2019s entire body. He felt heavy and sleepy, a faint noise like distant windchimes tinkling. He squinted and the barely-there little yellow butterflies fluttering over Malfoy\u2019s head resolved into pond pixies, giggling and darting around.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhere\u2019d they come from?\u201d Harry said.</p>\n<p>\u201cThey\u2019re everywhere,\u201d Draco said, yawning, and waved a hand lazily through the cloud. \u201cThey like wizards: we give off magic. At least, <em>some</em> of us do,\u201d he added, but it was a halfhearted jibe at best.</p>\n<p>Harry spent the next ten minutes trying to persuade himself he couldn\u2019t just lie here tucked up next to Malfoy. His eyes just kept drifting shut, and his limbs didn\u2019t want to move.</p>\n<p>\u201cOo, look at the lovebirds,\u201d a sneering voice said. \u201cAll cozy with your new <em>boyfriend</em>, Potter?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHi to you too, Dudley,\u201d Harry said, resignedly, opening his eyes.</p>\n<p>Dudley sniggered. He\u2019d come to stand over them, his buddies Piers and Malcolm already with him. He was still wearing his Smeltings uniform. \u201cShould\u2019ve known you were bent, Potter. What, aren\u2019t you going to introduce us?\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco pushed up on one elbow. \u201cMy name is Draco Ignatius Abraxus Malfoy, thirty-seventh of my line,\u201d he said, as cold and drawling as he could go. \u201cYou needn\u2019t bother to tell me yours.\u201d He reached out, cupped a handful of the pixies out of the air, and whispered something to them briefly before he blew them off his palm straight at Dudley.</p>\n<p>Dudley swatted at the pixies, scowling, and then started swatting again, more urgently, his eyes going wide. The pixies were darting at him and the other boys, pulling their hair, their clothes\u2014Harry saw one dive in, land on Dudley\u2019s ear, and\u2014 \u201cOw!\u201d Dudley yelled. \u201cOw! Get off!\u201d and smacked himself on the side of the head: the pixie had <em>bitten</em> him. He and Piers and Malcolm all started backing away, waving their arms around in the air more and more wildly, tiny red spots flaring as the pixies kept finding bare spots to bite. They finally turned tail and fled, jumping and hopping and smacking themselves all over, the cloud of pale yellow butterfly-wings trailing after them.</p>\n<p>Harry laughed so hard his stomach hurt, falling back to the ground. Draco was wheezing with laughter too, and then he thumped Harry hard in the shoulder. \u201cI <em>knew</em> you couldn\u2019t be such a ridiculous prig as you make out at school. Honestly, Potter, what d\u2019you do it for?\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry stopped laughing. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou can\u2019t <em>really</em> think those useless lumbering clods are as good as we are!\u201d Draco said, waving an arm after the fleeing gang. \u201cJust <em>look</em> at them!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Dudley</em>\u2019s an arsehole!\u201d Harry said. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean all Muggles are like him. For that matter,\u201d he added pointedly, \u201cI could name a wizard or two who\u2019s as bad as he is.\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco rolled his eyes. \u201cOh, I\u2019m so <em>sorry</em>, have I hurt your ickle feelings, Potter? I\u2019m not in the business of pretending the pathetic aren\u2019t. Don\u2019t try to tell me you didn\u2019t like watching those Muggles run.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry sprang up, fists clenched. He could have punched Draco in the face, except he\u2019d already learned the hard way back at Hogwarts that it would\u2019ve felt like punching himself in the face twice as hard. He turned and stalked away instead, ignoring the burning tug in his belly until Draco finally had to get up and follow, seething on his heels the whole way back to the house. There was a lot of noise and yelling going on in the yard, Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon chasing Dudley around with tea towels trying to smack away the pixies, all of them red-faced and ridiculous.</p>\n<p>Harry <em>did</em> like seeing it. He couldn\u2019t help the mean hot glad feeling in his belly. He jerked open the front door and went inside, teeth clenched over it. Draco caught up and shoved him in the middle of his back; Harry stumbled down the hall and turned.</p>\n<p>Draco had put one hand on the wall to brace himself against the return shove, like he <em>had</em> thought through how to get around it. \u201cYou can\u2019t bear anyone looking down at you for your filthy Muggle relations, is that it, so you\u2019ve got to pretend there\u2019s nothing wrong with their sort\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Nothing wrong with them?</em>\u201d Harry said, savagely. \u201cI <em>hate</em> them!\u201d He grabbed the cupboard door and jerked it open. The little cot with its threadbare stained blanket was still in there, buried under umbrellas and shoeboxes and dust, spiders scurrying into the corners away from the light of the one swinging bulb. \u201cTell me, how d\u2019you like <em>this</em> room? That\u2019s where they kept me, before my letter came. Anything odd happened round me, they\u2019d lock me in there day and night, weeks sometimes. Once they forgot I was in there and didn\u2019t feed me for two days. When they did let me out, they treated me like a house elf\u2014made me scrub dishes and do the sweeping up, talking all the time how generous they were taking me in at all. They never told me anything about magic. They even told me my mum and dad died in a car crash. <em>I hate them</em>, and I\u2019m not going to be anything like them, and <em>you are</em>, with all your <em>rot</em> about being better than other people and looking down your nose at anyone who\u2019s not your kind.\u201d</p>\n<p>He slammed the cupboard door and shoved past Draco before he could say anything else back. He went upstairs into his own room and shut the door. He could faintly hear the Dursleys still howling outside on the lawn, Dudley gone into blubbering now. He gritted his teeth, and then he went to the window and opened it and called Hedwig. \u201cDo you think you can run off those pixies?\u201d he asked her. She hooted with faint indignation, like he really had to ask, and swooped away.</p>\n<p>The ache had been steadily climbing. Harry breathed deeply through his nose and went out and crossed the hall to the other bedroom. Draco was sitting in the one armchair glaring at a school book, not really reading it. Harry ignored him and went over to the bed and threw himself on it flat on his back. It wasn\u2019t like touching, but this was close enough to be bearable.</p>\n<p>Draco said abruptly, \u201cI\u2019d have killed them.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cEasy for you to say. I bet you\u2019ve never actually thought about killing anyone.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve thought about killing <em>you</em> twice a day since first year.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHave you?\u201d Harry said. \u201c<em>Really</em>? Not just how great it would be if I was gone, but thought it through? How you\u2019d do it, every step of the way, imagined me lying dead on the ground in front of you after?\u201d Draco didn\u2019t say anything. \u201cKilling people\u2019s a lot harder than it sounds.\u201d Harry rolled on his side to face the wall. \u201cHermione says that\u2019s a good thing,\u201d he added after a moment. \u201cOtherwise it means you\u2019re a psychopath.\u201d</p>\n<p>#</p>\n<p>The Dursleys avoided them like plague, after. Aunt Petunia lay in wait for Harry the next morning and in a hissing whisper informed him when she\u2019d leave their meals, eyes darting every moment to the bathroom door where Draco had just gone into the shower. She retreated to her room as soon as she\u2019d said. The food stayed at dinner party levels, too, like she was afraid if it wasn\u2019t, Draco would track her down and make a fuss.</p>\n<p>\u201cAs I <em>would</em>, if it got worse than <em>this</em>,\u201d Draco said, turning his nose up at a plate of Chicken Forestiere, another of Aunt Petunia\u2019s specialities.</p>\n<p>\u201cWill you stop complaining for once?\u201d Harry said. \u201cIt\u2019s almost as good as Hogwarts.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou say that like the Hogwarts mess is anything other than revolting,\u201d Draco said. \u201cMy father says it\u2019s meant to build character.\u201d</p>\n<p>Malfoy could say whatever he liked; Harry would take it. He\u2019d\u2014take all of it, actually. Decent grub, scarcely seeing any of the Dursleys between the hours of one day, no chores and no bullying, not being locked in his room, and even <em>company</em>. Which Draco oughtn\u2019t have been, and wasn\u2019t if they <em>talked</em>, but they didn\u2019t need to talk. England obligingly provided clouds six days in seven, and they both spent every minute they could flying. And flying with Draco was brilliant. He really was good to begin with, and though he\u2019d always been a lot lazier about practice than Harry, after a couple of weeks of going from morning to night, he made it up, and they were pretty evenly matched. Harry ashamedly had to admit to himself it was even more fun than flying one-on-one with Ron, who couldn\u2019t catch the Snitch one in ten.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He didn\u2019t mention that in his letters. With Hedwig loose, he could actually write, too, and Hermione and Ron wrote to him like they\u2019d worked out a schedule\u2014knowing Hermione, she had\u2014so he was hearing from one of them practically every day. Ron\u2019s letters always ended <em>Write back soon so I know he hasn\u2019t killed you!</em> Harry didn\u2019t fancy trying to explain anything about how it was going.</p>\n<p>Especially anything about the nights. At all.</p>\n<p>In mid-July, though, they hit a stretch of beautiful hot sunny days. After five days Harry woke up to find Draco scowling out the window at the golden weather, and he turned the scowl on Harry. \u201cI am <em>not</em> moping around this benighted backwater for another minute,\u201d he announced.</p>\n<p>Harry sighed. \u201cWhat d\u2019you want to do about it, Malfoy? We can\u2019t help the weather.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe can help the <em>location</em>,\u201d Draco said. \u201cGet dressed, Potter, we\u2019re going to London.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry blinked. \u201cWhat, on the train?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>I</em> don\u2019t see a properly certified carpet around here, do <em>you?</em>\u201d Draco said.</p>\n<p>\u201cMy uncle\u2019s not going to give me train fare,\u201d Harry said.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Money</em> is not a concern,\u201d Draco said, and it turned out not to be: when the conductor came round, he reached into a leather sack tied onto his belt and produced a fifty pound note.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019d better not be about to get us taken up for counterfeit,\u201d Harry muttered under his breath, watching it go.</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t be idiotic, Potter,\u201d Draco said. \u201cIt\u2019s just a \u2019change purse. A service Gringotts offers their elite clientele,\u201d he added, smug, but for once Harry let him get away with it, watching the countryside whip by. They came out in Kings Cross station and Draco took him into a cupboard marked <em>No entry unless authorised</em> and through its back wall into a little cul-de-sac just off Diagon Alley. \u201cCivilization at last,\u201d Draco sighed, and made a bee-line straight for the Leaky Cauldron.</p>\n<p>He even stood Harry lunch without making anything of it, probably because he didn\u2019t think anything of it; the bill came to him and he scrawled his name across the bottom and it was whisked away without any further ado. \u201cYour parents let you spend whatever you like?\u201d Harry said, half incredulous. Not even the Dursleys went that far with Dudley, which was just as well, since he\u2019d probably have eaten them straight into a second mortgage.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNaturally they trust my judgement,\u201d Draco said loftily.</p>\n<p>They spent the afternoon wandering around the shops. They both stared wistfully in at the window at the just-released Nimbus 2020, which had eyes painted on the broomstick just above the twigs behind the rider\u2019s seat, and claimed to convey perception of the entire field of play. Harry nudged Draco. \u201cIf you\u2019re so rich\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m expected to be <em>responsible </em>with my money, Potter,\u201d Draco said snottily, but when Harry gave him a hard look of disbelief he scowled and muttered, \u201cAnd I\u2019d be cut off if I tried to buy anything that expensive.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry had a few Galleons in his pocket, so he got a broomstick tuning kit. Malfoy did pick up a Cup-quality Snitch, nearly twice as fast as the ones they used at Hogwarts. \u201cToo much for you to handle, Potter, do you think?\u201d he said, holding it up.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll take <em>you</em> best two of three,\u201d Harry said.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ll see,\u201d Draco said, eyes narrowing, and put down his money.</p>\n<p>They didn\u2019t get back to Little Whinging until after dark. Harry picked up a map of the Surrey line at the train station. \u201cWe can try taking our broomsticks to the old RAF station near Kenley, if it\u2019s still nice tomorrow,\u201d he said. \u201cBet there won\u2019t be anyone round there during the week.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cRight,\u201d Malfoy said, yawning.</p>\n<p>It wasn\u2019t a long walk back to the house. The Dursleys had already gone upstairs. They ate the waiting supper and went upstairs and got into bed. \u201cNight,\u201d Harry said, switching off the light.</p>\n<p>\u201cNight,\u201d Draco said.</p>\n<p>Nothing that happened after they said goodnight counted. They\u2019d made a rule of it.</p>\n<p>#</p>\n<p>The rest of July slid by as easily as a term at school, except with no work and more sunshine. They spent most of the two weeks flying at the RAF base, until the day they accidentally discovered to the dismay of everyone involved that the airfield was also used by the local hang-gliding club, and they had to make a dash for it. \u201cI still think we should just have Obliviated him,\u201d Draco said peevishly, panting and damp inside the cover of a big cumulonimbus.</p>\n<p>\u201cThen the Ministry would hear of it for sure, even if he hadn\u2019t fallen straight out of the sky and broken his neck!\u201d Harry said. \u201cHe\u2019s not going to tell anyone he saw two kids flying on broomsticks, they\u2019d be sure to think he\u2019d gone daft.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry had never seen Uncle Vernon as happy as the day they changed houses. He was actually humming the whole while as he carried the trunks down to the car and drove them the two hours west. Draco gave directions at the end in short, clipped tones, the narrow road plunging into a dense forest without so much as a turnoff for miles. But even when it petered out into gravel, Uncle Vernon didn\u2019t make a peep of complaint: only when he took a turn and the road crossed a narrow strip of wet marsh and came up to a pair of iron gates across the road. \u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d he said, slamming on the brakes. \u201cHave you taken us the wrong way? It\u2019s a dead end!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s my <em>drive</em>, you blithering Muggle,\u201d Draco said icily. \u201cHow does this glass open?\u201d Harry reached over him and rolled down the window, just as Uncle Vernon screamed: pale arms had started to claw out of the marsh, heads emerging, ghastly white things with empty eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s all right, it\u2019s <em>me</em>,\u201d Draco said loudly out the window, and they all slid back into the murky water, never taking their eyes off the car, as the gates creaked open on their own.</p>\n<p>Uncle Vernon shot down the drive as fast as the car could go, gravel pinging the undercarriage all the way. In a minute the gates were out of sight behind them on the twisting road, and it kept going after that, that dark forest still everywhere on all sides with no sign of a break. \u201cWhere\u2019s the <em>house?</em>\u201d Uncle Vernon finally demanded, and then said, \u201cAh, finally!\u201d as it came into view: a three story stone cottage with a pointed roof set into a low stone wall running across the road, with another gate set into it. He pulled up to the gate and parked.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat an unspeakable idiot you are,\u201d Draco said in a contemplative tone, not making any effort to get out. A man in leather clothing had just come out of the house, but it wasn\u2019t his dad. \u201cHello, Winchley.\u201d</p>\n<p>The man bowed. \u201cWelcome home, Master Draco,\u201d he intoned, and turned to wave at the gate, which swung open.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell?\u201d Draco said to Uncle Vernon sarcastically. \u201cAre we ever getting there?\u201d which Harry was beginning to wonder, himself, and Uncle Vernon must have, too; he picked up more and more speed down the road until they came around a turn and the woods suddenly broke open completely, and he slammed to a halt, staring. Harry stared, too. They weren\u2019t up to the house, yet: the house looked like it was another mile straight away from them, down a long drive between eight-foot-tall hedges. It wasn\u2019t hard to make out at the distance, though. It had four towers rising up into the sky, all golden stone and enormous mullioned windows and delicate ironwork, like the National Trust house near Little Whinging that Aunt Petunia liked to visit at weekends in spring. Only it was bigger.</p>\n<p>Draco sighed. \u201cMust I ask why we\u2019ve stopped <em>again?</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou don\u2019t live <em>there</em>,\u201d Harry said, still staring.</p>\n<p>\u201cI certainly don\u2019t live in the <em>gatehouse</em>,\u201d Draco said snidely.</p>\n<p>Harry had always figured when Malfoy went on and on about his money and his house that he was showing off just to be unbearable. On some level, he didn\u2019t really believe there was anybody this rich who wasn\u2019t the Queen, or at least American.</p>\n<p>After a moment, Uncle Vernon drove on, wearing a confused expression. His eyes repeatedly darted to the mirror, taking looks back at Draco. It was probably throwing his brain for loops trying to work out whether the gigantic heaps of money trumped the magic.</p>\n<p>When he finally pulled up in front of the house, the front door was already open, and Draco\u2019s mum was standing at the top of the stairs. She wore a long white dress with robes of spiderwebby black lace over it, her white-and-black hair pinned up and her hands folded in front of her. Harry swallowed.</p>\n<p>Draco swallowed too, and got out of the car. She came down the stairs and met him at the foot. She didn\u2019t hug him or anything, just touched his face with one hand. Her mouth trembled for a moment. \u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re home safe, darling,\u201d was all she said, before looking over at Harry. She stared at him intently for a long moment, and then she put on a smile that didn\u2019t get anywhere near the rest of her face and held her hand out. \u201cYou must be Harry Potter.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cEr,\u201d Harry said. \u201cYeah.\u201d He stared at her hand: it definitely wasn\u2019t in the right position for shaking. He shot Draco a look, but Draco wasn\u2019t being any help at the moment; he was standing rigidly still, his mouth downturned, like he wasn\u2019t even happy to be home after all his endless complaining about everywhere else. After a moment Harry took her hand in his fingers and fumbled a sort of bow over it without actually kissing it.</p>\n<p>She at least took her hand back, afterwards, and glanced over at Uncle Vernon, who\u2019d uncertainly got out the trunks. She said to Harry, \u201cIs this your driver?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHis uncle,\u201d Draco said briefly.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, I see,\u201d Mrs. Malfoy said. She put the smile back on. \u201cI hope Draco has minded his manners properly while staying with you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cEr,\u201d Uncle Vernon said.</p>\n<p>Mrs. Malfoy smiled and nodded just as if he\u2019d said <em>oh yes beautifully behaved</em>. \u201cPlease convey my thanks to your wife. There\u2019s no need to worry about the trunks. Have a pleasant drive home.\u201d She turned and went back up the stairs into the house, a clear dismissal. Uncle Vernon stood staring up after her a moment. Then the trunks abruptly vanished with two loud bangs, and he jumped a foot straight up, then flung himself back into the car and peeled out, gravel and dust spinning up from the wheels as he shot away.</p>\n<p>Harry stared after the vanishing car, then turned round to face the house. It <em>looked</em> like a National Trust stately home, but it didn\u2019t <em>feel</em> anything like one. He couldn\u2019t imagine tourists going in voluntarily. It loomed over him, all the windows dark and the front door standing open like a mouth. Mrs. Malfoy had already gone inside, and Draco was climbing the stairs after her, the leash tugging away. Harry squared his shoulders, reminded himself the Malfoys couldn\u2019t do anything to him without hurting Draco, and followed him in.</p>\n<p>The light from the huge windows didn\u2019t seem able to get far into the house. There wasn\u2019t really an entryway or anything: they came right into a cavernous great hall, the walls paneled in heavy wood and draped with hangings, fireplace roaring and hanging lanterns full of flickering magical light. Mrs. Malfoy didn\u2019t pause: she walked through the room and disappeared through a door at the far end. Harry followed her and Draco out of the room and up a big stone staircase to the first floor.</p>\n<p>At the top she turned to face Draco. The smile had gone, and her lips were pressed together. She didn\u2019t look happy\u2014worried, maybe. Harry eyed both of them warily, wondering what was going on. \u201cYour father is in his study,\u201d she told Draco.</p>\n<p>Draco didn\u2019t move a moment. Then he jerked a single nod and turned and went to the wooden door at the side of the landing and walked through it. Harry uncertainly took a step after him. \u201cI\u2019ll show you to your room,\u201d Mrs. Malfoy said, sharply, and started walking up the next flight of stairs.</p>\n<p>\u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d Harry said, louder than he meant to: his voice seemed to echo weirdly off the dark walls. She turned, a few steps up, and stared coldly down at him. He cleared his throat. \u201cI can\u2019t go that far from Draco.\u201d He was already too far: Harry could feel him drawing away, on the other side of the door.</p>\n<p>She stood looking down at him, her mouth a hard straight line. \u201cVery well,\u201d she said abruptly. \u201cYou can wait for him here, then.\u201d Then she whirled and was gone, skirts swirling behind her as she vanished up the stairs. Harry hesitated, then he went to the door and opened it. There was a gigantic sitting room on the other side\u2014smaller than the one downstairs, but still bigger than all the Dursleys\u2019 house put together. A vast tapestry ran the entire length of the wall, with velvet-cushioned wooden chairs lined up in front of it.</p>\n<p>After a moment, Harry sat down. Draco was somewhere behind the last door at the end of the room. Harry felt him there like a piece of himself that had wandered off by accident. But the walls swallowed noise: he could faintly hear a buzz of muffled voices, but he couldn\u2019t make out the words or even who was talking. The talking went on a while. Harry got up and started looking at the tapestry: it was a woven picture of the entire house, with little woven figures moving through it, wearing really old clothing, neck ruffs and big dresses and balloon trousers with hose. He got interested and started following some of them around. There was even a little stray cat, and he was crouched down to watch it lapping at a dish of milk in the kitchens when the blow cracked down on his shoulders, sharp and hot, and he nearly fell to his knees with a gasp of surprise.</p>\n<p>He was turning, groping for his wand, before he realized it wasn\u2019t <em>him</em>, being hit. The second blow landed, lower on his back, a long hot stripe of pain. Harry swallowed a yell and took a step towards the door\u2014then he heard it, right as the pain bloomed again. The thwack of a rod, long and narrow, coming down on bare skin. He stood gasping. He didn\u2019t know what to do. He couldn\u2019t go <em>in</em> there? Two more blows came\u2014carefully, deliberately spaced, as if he was meant to be just getting his breath back before the next one landed and knocked it right back out of him.</p>\n<p>Somehow that finally pushed him into movement. He gripped his wand in his fist and took a step towards the door. Another blow made him stumble, though, and then\u2014then the next one didn\u2019t come. Harry had his hand on the doorknob. He stood, hesitating, and then it jerked open under his hand. Draco was on the other side. His face was flushed and sweaty, his eyes bright and wet. He glared at Harry, furiously, and jerked his chin forward: <em>get out of my way!</em> Behind his back, Harry could see Lucius Malfoy seating himself in a big armchair behind a desk, and picking up a book he\u2019d left marked on the table. He glanced up at the door and caught Harry\u2019s eye for a moment with a narrow, reptilian look. Then he looked away, and went back to his reading even as Draco forced Harry back and pulled the door shut.</p>\n<p>Harry was shaking with anger, his fist clenched tight around his wand. Draco shoved past him and walked back to the stairs. \u201cWhat the hell was that?\u201d Harry said, through clenched teeth, following him. \u201cDraco!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat do you <em>think</em>, Potter?\u201d Draco said icily, over his shoulder. \u201cIn my family, there are consequences when you\u2019re stupid enough to go bumbling into a binding-spell, much less when you do it with an enemy of your house.\u201d</p>\n<p>He didn\u2019t act like it was anything new. He\u2019d been <em>expecting</em> it, Harry realized, and suddenly remembered, horribly, that time the students had come back from Christmas break and Draco had spent a few days limping and looking a little ill. <em>Probably ate too much roast baby unicorn</em>, Ron had said, and they\u2019d snickered about it. He\u2019d even overheard Snape saying, \u201cMr. Malfoy, you should see Madame Pomfrey.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d Draco had said. \u201cI just had a flying accident over break.\u201d Right, of course he had. When you had a flying accident, why wouldn\u2019t you just go to the infirmary?</p>\n<p>\u201cBet the bastard didn\u2019t mind he got to beat me right along with you,\u201d Harry said savagely. \u201cIf he tries it again while I\u2019m here, I\u2019m going to hex him.\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco wheeled around on him furiously. \u201cDon\u2019t you <em>dare</em> threaten my father!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe beat you with a stick!\u201d Harry yelled. \u201cAt least Uncle Vernon doesn\u2019t pretend he <em>loves me</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShut up,\u201d Draco snarled, and whirled and stormed up the stairs\u2014too fast, it was making his back hurt and his head spin. Harry gritted his teeth and caught up to him, and got Draco\u2019s arm slung over his shoulders just as he sagged and almost missed his footing.</p>\n<p>\u201cCome on,\u201d Harry muttered. \u201cWhich way\u2019s your room?\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco\u2019s room was ridiculously huge, too, with an enormous four-poster wooden bed in the middle of the back wall draped all in dark blue velvet. Harry got him over to it, and Draco crawled onto it and lay face-down with his feet sticking off the side, head pillowed on one arm. He didn\u2019t talk. Harry stood by the side of the bed, his hands clenching and working. He could feel the throbbing pain of all the strokes, only getting worse.</p>\n<p>He turned away and rummaged in the desk and found a pair of scissors, and cut Draco\u2019s shirt off him. Draco didn\u2019t protest. The strokes had left big, inch-wide angry red welts, a few of them with broken skin, trickles of blood the black shirt and trousers hadn\u2019t shown. There were a few pale older scars on Draco\u2019s back beneath them\u2014cuts <em>left</em> to scar, even though Madame Pomfrey or any mediwizard could have healed anything like that with a wave of a wand. Harry wished he could call Hermione and ask her what to do; he wished he could call <em>Dumbledore</em>, who\u2019d know what to do about Draco\u2019s father beating him bloody on a regular basis.</p>\n<p>He got up and went to the bathroom. If he\u2019d been at home he\u2019d have given Draco a fistful of paracetamol out of the medicine cabinet, but the Malfoys probably didn\u2019t believe in anything as Muggle as painkillers. The cabinets had some unlabeled ointments in jars, but he didn\u2019t know what any of them did, so he just got a cold flannel instead.</p>\n<p>Draco made a choked gasping noise the moment Harry tried to lay it down on his back, and Harry jerked back and stared: the welt where his fingers had brushed it was melting away. Warily, he tried just barely touching the edge of the welt\u2014Draco gasped again. The puffy swollen flesh was deflating, the redness fading straight out of it. Harry could feel the ache of it disappearing from his own body. He slowly traced each welt with just the tip of his finger, as carefully as he could, each one sinking straight away into smooth unmarked skin. Even the ones where the skin had broken, the cuts closed right up, blood drying up and flaking away. Harry lifted his hand and stared down at it: there was nothing left but the few faint scars\u2014then he put his hand on one of those, too.</p>\n<p>Nothing happened, to start. Harry gritted his teeth and tried to\u2014<em>pull</em>, like tugging on the leash, only on purpose. Abruptly he felt a fresh sharp pain in his back, flaring for just a moment, and then the scar wiped away under his fingers like a chalkmark. Draco was panting, and he pushed himself up and stared at Harry. \u201cWhat are you <em>doing?</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t know!\u201d Harry said. They stared at each other.</p>\n<p>Draco swallowed and after a moment muttered, \u201cWell, stop it.\u201d He got off the bed and went to the wardrobe. Harry stayed sitting on the bed, staring down at the heap of ruined shirt, the bloodstains showing dark against the fabric.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not right,\u201d he said through his teeth.</p>\n<p>Draco was buttoning up a clean shirt in front of a tall mazy-glassed mirror. He paused, staring into it: even in the reflection he wouldn\u2019t look over and meet Harry\u2019s eyes. \u201cTry not to be stupid,\u201d he said after a moment. \u201c<em>You</em> know what\u2019s coming. Or <em>who</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cVol\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t <em>say it</em>,\u201d Draco said. \u201cWhat d\u2019you think <em>he\u2019s</em> going to think of it, if he comes back and finds my father hosting <em>The Boy Who Lived</em> in his house, finds my father\u2019s let his son and heir get <em>Fettered</em> to Harry Potter?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Harry snapped. \u201cMaybe that you\u2019ve all come to your senses and don\u2019t want anything to do with him?\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco turned round, his face tight. \u201cRight in one, Potter,\u201d he said. \u201cThink he\u2019s going to take that well, do you? \u2018Nice having you, no hard feelings, take care, never mind that silly oath of loyalty?\u2019\u201d Harry stared at him. \u201cHe\u2019ll <em>kill my father</em>, you idiot.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo your father <em>beat</em> you to prove he\u2019s really loyal?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI suppose you wouldn\u2019t take a caning to have <em>your</em> parents back,\u201d Draco said.</p>\n<p>Harry jumped off the bed and faced off with him. \u201cAnd <em>then</em> what, Malfoy? When You-Know-Who says right, I\u2019ll forgive you that one, now go murder a dozen wizards for me, <em>really</em> prove you\u2019re loyal\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco looked away. \u201cA bunch of blood traitors and Muggle-borns\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry shoved him, didn\u2019t even care that he nearly fell over himself, and Draco turned and swung a fist at him wildly. It connected with Harry\u2019s cheek and they both went down, like hitting the floor in twice as many places at once, and started rolling around punching each other furiously. Harry couldn\u2019t keep doing it, it was like beating your own head against a wall, but it almost felt good for a moment until the doubling pain flattened them both and they went limp, crumpled together and half sobbing for breath.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat do you want me to say?\u201d Draco said, his voice cracking. There was blood running from his lip; he wiped it away. His face was twisted up, tears sliding out of his eyes. \u201cI don\u2019t get to walk away.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou expect me to feel <em>sorry</em> for you?\u201d Harry dragged himself up to his feet, stood over Draco with his fists clenched. \u201cYour father had a choice, didn\u2019t he? He <em>picked</em> Vol\u2014<em>fine</em>, he picked You-Know-Who. My family didn\u2019t get to choose. He came to our house, murdered my mum and dad\u2014he tried to kill me in my <em>crib</em>. That\u2019s what your dad signed on for, and if you sign on for it, too, don\u2019t expect me to care that you\u2019re doing it for him. I <em>wouldn\u2019t</em> murder someone else\u2019s family to have mine back. I <em>wouldn\u2019t</em>, and if you would, you\u2019re as big a beast as he is.\u201d</p>\n<p>He turned and limped out of the room, his whole body aching. The leash didn\u2019t want him to go, but he shoved through the feeling. There was another bedroom next door: his trunk was in it. Harry went inside and slammed the door. His stomach was roiling. He snuffled into his sleeve, wiping his eyes. After a moment, he went and sat down against the adjoining wall. He could feel Draco sitting on the other side, back to his.</p>\n<p>#</p>\n<p>Dinner showed up on a tray at the stroke of eight\u2014really showed up, it just appeared on the table in the corner of the room, complete with big silver candlestick and three plates stacked up along with a bread plate and a finger bowl and nine pieces of silverware. Harry went over and stared down at it: there was only a tiny bit of food on the top plate, a mini pancake sort of thing with odd stuff he didn\u2019t recognize piled on top of it, thin circles of red and yellow, a single dollop of cream, a green leaf on top. He wondered if it was some sort of magic thing that filled you up in a bite. Or maybe just poisoned you: Harry wasn\u2019t sure at this point that he <em>would</em> put it past Lucius Malfoy to make his own son ill just to get him, after all. <em>That</em> would show how loyal he was, wouldn\u2019t it.</p>\n<p>He had to eat at some point, though, so he picked it up and popped it into his mouth. It tasted\u2014it did taste almost like magic, weird and a bit crunchy and a bit sour and then this odd pop of something spicy and unrecognizable out of nowhere at the end, but after he swallowed, he was still just as hungry as he had been. At least he didn\u2019t feel immediately poisoned, so probably they weren\u2019t going to kill him tonight, anyway.</p>\n<p>He wasn\u2019t going to starve either, as the top plate vanished and some more strange-looking food appeared on the next one down, and also a roll of bread showed up. Harry didn\u2019t really know what to make of it all: it didn\u2019t taste or look like food, exactly, although he filled up eventually. Some of the food really was magic, including one clear lump of jelly sitting inside a bowl of soup that had tiny live fish swimming around inside it\u2014Harry gave that a wide berth\u2014and the dessert, which was a gingerbread house with working door and a fireplace really going, puffs of warm smoke coming out the chimney. He watched it too fascinated to eat until suddenly the oven popped open and a tiny gingerbread man jumped out and ran straight out the door of the house and off the plate, and started racing around the table squeaking \u201ccan\u2019t catch me!\u201d in a maddening high pitched voice.</p>\n<p>Harry <em>couldn\u2019t</em> catch him, though he nearly took out the wine glass and the pepper mill trying. The gingerbread man waggled his tiny arms jeeringly from behind the candlestick while Harry glared. After another five minutes of failure and taunting, Draco barged into the room. \u201cHonestly, Potter,\u201d he said, grabbed the side pitcher of tarry molasses-smelling stuff, and poured it across the gingerbread man\u2019s path. The cookie dashed into it, stuck fast, and stood there yelling. \u201cThere, go ahead.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUm,\u201d Harry said. He wasn\u2019t sure how he felt about eating it.</p>\n<p>Draco rolled his eyes and snatched it and popped it in his mouth. \u201cIt\u2019s a <em>cookie</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHow does it <em>do</em> that?\u201d Harry said, peering inside the house again.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s an American wizarding recipe,\u201d Draco said. \u201cMy great-grandmother brought it with her. If you\u2019re not going to eat the men, start eating the house before it makes more.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat, I\u2019m shocked, one of your relatives married a colonial?\u201d Harry said. He broke off the chimney and bit into it: the gingerbread was warm through and just the right sort of chewy and soft.</p>\n<p>\u201cShe was proper German wizarding stock, of course, they just made their <em>money</em> in America,\u201d Draco said, irritably. He took a bit of the front door.</p>\n<p>Harry was pretty sure that he\u2019d learned in Muggle Studies that American wizards intermarried more than anyone else, and there wasn\u2019t a single pureblood line longer than three generations that anyone could prove. He didn\u2019t want to end up punching himself in the head any more, though, so he didn\u2019t argue the point. They picked at the house together while the rest of the dishes cleared themselves off.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou don\u2019t eat like this every night, do you?\u201d Harry said.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat, in a civilized manner?\u201d Draco said. \u201cWhen I get the chance I do. This was always my favorite pudding, when I was little,\u201d he added, taking another piece of sugar-glazed roof.</p>\n<p>It had gone dark outside, but there were lights coming up throughout the gardens outside, bobbing in the air like paper lanterns. After they finished, Harry said, \u201cLook, can we go out? I want a walk.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFine,\u201d Draco said after a moment, and led him downstairs and through a back door. They wandered along the paths winding through the hedges and formal gardens. The air was full of the smell of summer flowers, the magical lights glittering everywhere, the windows of the house shining. Draco walked without even looking around, eyes mostly fixed on the ground, and fine, Harry <em>did</em> feel sorry for him. He didn\u2019t know how you\u2019d give up\u2014not the stupid house, but <em>belonging</em> to it, to a family.</p>\n<p>He glanced up at the house as they came back inside. Narcissa Malfoy was standing at a window on the second floor, watching them\u2014watching Draco. She met Harry\u2019s eyes a moment, and then she turned away and vanished inside. \u201cWell?\u201d Draco said, standing inside the door.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Harry said, and went in.</p>\n<p>#</p>\n<p>Dear Harry,</p>\n<p>I\u2019m really concerned! I looked up what you\u2019re describing, being able to heal a cut Draco got, and that\u2019s an advanced form of pain-sharing. It shouldn\u2019t be happening unless the\u00a0 bond\u2019s become really strong. Have the two of you been doing anything that might make you more in sympathy with each other? What I mean is, if you\u2019ve been doing things that make you both feel the same way\u2014angry at the same time, or happy at the same time\u2014that\u2019s the sort of thing that can intensify the bond.</p>\n<p>You should completely avoid touching him. Definitely <em>don\u2019t</em> heal him again! I wrote to the St. Mungo\u2019s archivists, and there are seventeen cases in the literature where a Fettering Curse has transmuted into an Indissoluble Bond, and fifteen of those involved one of the cursed pair healing the other of a serious injury. The other two pairs had a baby together, which obviously isn\u2019t something you need to worry about, although you probably shouldn\u2019t have sex with him, either, just to be safe. (That\u2019s a joke!)</p>\n<p>Love, Hermione</p>\n<p>#</p>\n<p>Harry stared at the letter. \u201cWhat\u2019s your Muggle girlfriend on about now?\u201d Draco said, yawning as he stretched his arms over his head in the bed. Harry turned the stare over at him, and Draco frowned and sat up and grabbed the letter out of his hands and read it. His head jerked up. \u201cWe could get <em>stuck</em> this way?\u201d They both leaped out of the bed hurriedly.</p>\n<p>They agreed they\u2019d have to spend the rest of the month as far apart as they could manage. \u201cIt\u2019s only another four weeks,\u201d Draco said.</p>\n<p>The problem was they couldn\u2019t actually <em>do</em> anything without each other, except sit in their rooms on either side of the wall and read, which wasn\u2019t helping at all with the <em>sympathy</em> part, because it left them both feeling the same way: desperately bored out of their skulls. When Harry thumped his head backwards against the wall and heard an echo of Draco doing the exact same thing at the exact same time, he gave up. \u201cWe need to find something you want to do that I\u2019ll hate, and something I want to do that you\u2019ll hate, and take turns,\u201d Harry said.</p>\n<p>\u201cSplendid, let\u2019s go and set some Muggles\u2019 houses on fire,\u201d Draco said sarcastically.</p>\n<p>Harry glared. \u201cThat\u2019s not funny!\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco folded his arms. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to avoid getting <em>bound together for life</em>, Potter! I\u2019m <em>perfectly</em> willing to burn down a few shacks to that end.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo Dark magic, no torturing anybody, and no breaking the law!\u201d Harry said. \u201cI don\u2019t know how your family haven\u2019t all ended up in prison before now.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMoney and charm,\u201d Draco said. \u201cAll right, fine, I want to go to the seaside.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUm,\u201d Harry said. \u201cThat sounds like fun.\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco scowled. \u201cSkiing? I could probably prevail upon my mother to take us.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry shrugged helplessly. He\u2019d never gone, but he was game to try.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou come up with something, then!\u201d Draco snapped.</p>\n<p>Harry wasn\u2019t really used to trying to think of things he wanted to do during the holidays. He\u2019d never had much of a choice in the matter. \u201cWait, I know!\u201d he said. \u201cLet\u2019s go to the pictures.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t I like going to the pictures?\u201d Draco demanded. \u201cUnless you want to see something <em>stupid</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s Muggle, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Harry said. \u201cWhy do you go?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u201cEven ants can build something impressive if you give them enough time,\u201d Draco informed him, with a superior air. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean I want to pal around with them.\u201d Then he paused, and Harry got a horrible sinking feeling in his stomach even before Draco said, \u201c<em>That\u2019s</em> it. I\u2019ll invite Crabbe and Goyle to come for the day.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh <em>no</em>,\u201d Harry groaned.</p>\n<p>\u201cPerfect,\u201d Draco said, smugly.</p>\n<p>#</p>\n<p>Crabbe and Goyle came over the next morning. Their capacity to come up with fun things to do was badly hampered by the fact that they couldn\u2019t chase Harry off or beat him up. \u201cLet\u2019s go to the clubhouse,\u201d Goyle said finally, after a massive mental effort.</p>\n<p>\u201cFancy you remembering that old thing,\u201d Draco said. \u201cAll right.\u201d</p>\n<p>The clubhouse turned out to be an ruined old watchtower half-lost in the woods. Apparently they\u2019d used it as a place to play, when they were kids. It looked like a deathtrap, and also amazing. The steps up to the top had fallen down, and the rope they\u2019d hung as kids broke as soon as Goyle tried to put his weight on it, dumping him on his arse. Harry snickered.</p>\n<p>Crabbe and Goyle both glared at him. \u201cWe\u2019ll build the stairs back up,\u201d Draco decided, and set them to hauling in rocks.</p>\n<p>Harry perched on the side and watched them grunt and sweat, but he got interested despite himself. \u201cWhat d\u2019you use this place for?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe usual,\u201d Draco said, waving a hand. \u201cI\u2019d be Merlin, and Goyle and Crabbe would be wizard-knights of the Order, defending Camelot against the wizard-hating Saxons, that sort of thing. Sometimes we\u2019d do Jack the Giant-Killer or defeating the Sphinx.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNot Robin Hood?\u201d Harry said, looking up at the trees overhanging the tower.</p>\n<p>Draco made a face. \u201cWho wants to be a fat friar?\u201d</p>\n<p>They kept tossing ideas back and forth while Crabbe and Goyle built the staircase, until they both got bored of sitting and pitched in to help. Even then, Draco ended up talking to him more than either of them, and Harry ended up having something too much like a good time.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>That</em> didn\u2019t work,\u201d Harry said to Draco, that night, as they ate dinner in his room\u2014they were both tired of eating alone. \u201cTomorrow\u2014\u201d he paused and tried to decide what would be worse for Draco; he thought it was a toss-up, but after thinking it through he decided he didn\u2019t completely trust Fred and George to keep in mind that <em>he\u2019d</em> end up feeling anything they did to Draco. \u201cTomorrow, we\u2019re going to visit Hermione.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUgh, you\u2019re mad,\u201d Draco said, scowling. \u201cWhy don\u2019t we just go visit your relations again, that sounds suitably awful.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>I\u2019d</em> hate seeing them, too!\u201d Harry said.</p>\n<p>Hermione met them at the door with a scroll thirty inches long full of questions and marched them into the living room and spent the entire day putting them through detailed experiments. \u201cThere\u2019s never been a Fettering Charm properly documented!\u201d she said when Harry tried to get out of the ninth test of how hard a pin-prick had to be before the other one felt it, and if it changed depending on how far apart they were at the time.</p>\n<p>He was grateful when Draco announced, \u201cMy mother\u2019s expecting us, Potter, we\u2019re leaving now,\u201d and they made their escape. \u201cWell, that was brilliant,\u201d Draco said to him as they waited for the train. \u201cTonight we\u2019ll have dinner with my parents.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry sighed.</p>\n<p>They got back to the Manor around two and spent the afternoon doing school reading. At half past seven Draco stood up. \u201cI\u2019m going to dress.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cEr,\u201d Harry said. \u201cYou are dressed.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not dressed for <em>dinner</em>,\u201d Draco said. He paused. \u201cYou do have something decent, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p>\n<p>What Draco meant by decent was that Harry\u2019s formal dress suit he\u2019d worn to the Yule Ball was an unacceptable set of rags. He dragged Harry over to his bedroom and threw shirts at Harry\u2019s head until they found one he could wear. \u201cThere\u2019s no help for the jacket, though,\u201d he informed Harry, impatiently taking over buttoning him up. His fingers brushed the hollow of Harry\u2019s throat\u2014the first time they\u2019d touched each other in a week, and Harry\u2019s whole body rang like a clamoring bell.</p>\n<p>Harry caught Draco\u2019s head and pulled him down. They kissed hungrily, eagerly\u2014Draco\u2019s hands deep in his hair, one kiss after another\u2014they jerked apart.</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t <em>look</em> at me!\u201d Draco yelled.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re looking at <em>me</em>!\u201d Harry said.</p>\n<p>Draco grabbed him and kissed him again. His hands slid under Harry\u2019s shirt. \u201cOh, God,\u201d Harry groaned. It wasn\u2019t even <em>dark</em>. He reached for Draco\u2019s collar\u2014</p>\n<p>Draco managed to pull away. \u201cMy tie!\u201d</p>\n<p>They both stood, panting. Draco ran a shaky hand back through his hair.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe could just\u2014\u201d Harry said, then he shut his eyes and pulled himself together. \u201cI\u2019m going back to my room.\u201d They finished dressing separately, and carefully didn\u2019t touch at all going down the stairs.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The dining hall was so long that Harry got to really enjoy the feeling of impending doom, walking towards the Malfoys. Huge iron lamps hung from the high ceiling, and the walls were lined with family portraits. All of them had something uncomplimentary to say about his jacket, and one old fellow with an ear horn halfway down the room said loudly to Draco, \u201cNever try to re-tie a tie, boy! Always take a fresh one if you make a mistake!\u201d Draco scowled up at him.</p>\n<p>Lucius and Narcissa were both in full evening wear, too. She had jewelry on and everything. Draco sat down on her left, but when Harry tried to sit next to him, he hissed, \u201c<em>No</em>, you\u2019ve got to sit on my mother\u2019s right!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s all right, darling,\u201d Narcissa said. \u201cWe\u2019re only eating <em>en famille</em> tonight, we can be informal.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry was pretty sure <em>informal</em> didn\u2019t mean what she thought it meant. He gave up trying to keep track of what he was supposed to be using when, since it didn\u2019t seem to help: Draco just reached over at the start of every course and yanked whichever utensil Harry had picked up straight out of his hand and put a different one in. Once it was a <em>completely identical</em> spoon. \u201cYou\u2019re just doing this on purpose!\u201d Harry hissed at him.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat was for the <em>last </em>course!\u201d Draco hissed back.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you give it to me then?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBecause you refused the soup, like the mannerless troll you are!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s the <em>same spoon!</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t in the same <em>place</em>,\u201d Draco said.</p>\n<p>Harry defiantly put down the absolutely correct spoon and picked back up the completely wrong spoon and glared at him. Draco glared back.</p>\n<p>The Malfoys had an epergne on their table. It was a good three feet long, shaped like a giant old Viking longship with a dragon\u2019s head at the prow, full of Norman warriors on horseback with their shields, riding up and down with the moving silver waves. They eyed Harry suspiciously, and some of them even fired bee-sting arrows at his fingers when he flubbed some bit of etiquette, which was often. Half the dishes tried to skip serving him, too, and then there was the conversation, which was either gossip about people he didn\u2019t know or Draco\u2019s parents quizzing him on how his classes were going. Harry didn\u2019t mind, he was just as glad to be left out of it, until he wasn\u2019t. \u201cDo you have a favorite class, Harry?\u201d Mrs. Malfoy unexpectedly asked.</p>\n<p>\u201cUh,\u201d Harry said, after gulping the bite he\u2019d just put in his mouth\u2014some kind of bright red noodles that he devoutly hoped he\u2019d only imagined moving on their own. \u201cCare of\u2014\u201d Draco kicked him under the table, and Harry belatedly remembered the Malfoys\u2019 case against Buckbeak, which made him glare at Draco, but the atmosphere of crushing formality got the better of him, and he said, \u201cTransfiguration\u2019s all right. I like Quidditch best, really.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHm,\u201d she said, eyeing Draco. \u201cI hear a great deal of it, myself.\u201d She didn\u2019t sound as if she really approved, either. Draco scowled at his plate. \u201cHave you considered your prospects after school?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019d\u2014like to go for Auror.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIndeed,\u201d Lucius Malfoy said, raising his eyebrow. \u201cA challenging course of study.\u201d</p>\n<p>He had a little smile on his face. Harry clenched his teeth. \u201cAt least it\u2019s for something that\u2019s worth it,\u201d he said. \u201cProtecting people.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d Lucius said, mockingly. \u201cI can see why you might find such a goal compelling.\u201d</p>\n<p>Next to him, Draco looked down at his plate, his mouth tightening. Narcissa Malfoy was watching him. \u201cSpeaking of which, I\u2019ve been meaning to ask you, darling,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s been a collapse in the wall along the southern border of the estate. Do you suppose you might mend it for me tomorrow?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, of course,\u201d Draco said.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd then we must think of going to get your things for next term,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s only another two weeks until school begins.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOnly two weeks more,\u201d Draco said, as they went upstairs.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Harry said.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt can\u2019t matter much what we do,\u201d Draco said.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Harry said.</p>\n<p>Draco opened the door to his bedroom and held it. Harry swallowed and went inside. He turned round as Draco shut the door and then they were kissing again, furiously, tearing at each other\u2019s clothes all the way across the room\u2014Harry fell backwards onto the bed panting, and Draco paused, propped over him. \u201cWait,\u201d he said, harshly, and got up and went into his bathroom. He came back with one of the jars.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that for?\u201d Harry said warily.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m going to have you,\u201d Draco said. There was color in his cheeks, his eyes glittering. \u201cTake your clothes off.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry swallowed. The things they definitely hadn\u2019t done at all in the dark hadn\u2019t included\u2014but Draco was there, kissing him, his hands shoving under Harry\u2019s borrowed shirt, pushing his trousers down\u2014Harry gave up trying not to want it and heeled his trainers off, lifted his hips from the bed so Draco could strip him. He was shivering, almost violently. Above him, Draco looked half mad, his lip bitten red, and he pushed Harry down and started <em>working</em> on him. Harry shoved his hands into his hair, staring up at the canopy and gasping as Draco touched him and rubbed him and then climbed onto him and <em>oh</em>, it was like touching, like kissing, only <em>more</em> like that, <em>better</em>. Draco was <em>inside</em> him, like taking a deep breath after holding it forever with lungs bursting, sweet and cool rush of relief, and Draco kissed him, blindly, his eyes squeezed shut.</p>\n<p>#</p>\n<p>They got a late start the next morning since they weren\u2019t saving it for in the dark anymore. Harry woke up already starting to mess around with Draco, drowsy kissing, nuzzling into him\u2014it felt so much <em>better</em> the closer he got. Draco moaned a little underneath him, squirming as Harry got a spot on his neck, and Harry groped over for the jar they\u2019d used last night. Draco gasped under his hands and then rolled over onto his stomach and sprawled out for it, huffing out small choked breaths as Harry worked into him, both of them groaning together, moving together\u2014</p>\n<p>Anyway, it was close to noon before they actually made it outside. They took their brooms, because <em>the border of the estate</em> was a good mile and a half away, and as long as they stayed low enough, there wasn\u2019t any chance of being seen: a sea of dark trees all below, stretching all the way to the horizon until they reached the place where the border wall carved a small canyon through them. Draco turned to follow the line of the wall, and another five minutes of fast flying brought them to the breach.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat did this?\u201d Harry said, poking at one of the stones: most of them were bigger than his head, and they\u2019d been scattered nearly thirty feet around the wall in either direction, opening a big gash in the wall.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve no idea,\u201d Draco said, frowning around at the mess. \u201cA giant could do it, but there aren\u2019t any round here.\u201d There weren\u2019t any footprints, though, and no real traces in the trees, either.</p>\n<p>Draco shrugged finally and gave up trying to figure it out. \u201cAll right, come on, let\u2019s just get it fixed.\u201d He took out his wand and pointed it at a rock. \u201c<em>Wingardium</em>\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019re you doing?\u201d Harry said. \u201cYou\u2019ll get dinged for underage magic.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo we won\u2019t! We\u2019re on wizard property, there\u2019s no Muggles to see, and my mother gave us the task,\u201d Draco said. \u201cI promise you, Potter, she didn\u2019t mean me to lift rocks with my <em>hands</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>They floated the rocks one after another back into place, starting with the ones furthest away. It took a long time: the wall was a couple of feet above their heads, and each boulder was huge and heavy and almost as unwieldy to levitate as they would\u2019ve been to lift. Hours dragged by\u2014at first it had been fun to use magic again, especially for something real, but by the end it started to pall.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>There</em>,\u201d Harry said, thumping down the last boulder. \u201cAnd if it comes down again, your mum can fix it <em>herself</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShe can hire <em>goblins</em>,\u201d Draco agreed, wiping sweat from his forehead. He turned to go back to the brooms, and then Harry heard a faint rumbling behind him, turned round to look, and the heavy thumping blow took him right in the chest. He sailed through the air and hit the ground, stunned and dazed, breath knocked out of him. He stared up at the sky overhead. \u201cOw,\u201d he said.</p>\n<p>Footsteps came running, and Draco dropped to the ground at his side, his hands reaching out towards him, shaking. \u201cI\u2019m all right,\u201d Harry said, coughing, and pushed himself up\u2014tried to push himself up. His elbow gave out from under him, weird and noodle-limp, like nothing more than the time Lockhart had turned his bones to jelly. Harry gasped for breath and coughed again, and his lips were wet\u2014a metallic taste in his mouth. Draco was shoving at his clothes, jerking them apart. Harry just managed to crane his head up and see his chest\u2014his chest half smashed open, ribs jutting out, red everywhere. A red-stained boulder had rolled away near his side; the wall had collapsed again behind them.</p>\n<p>His head fell back. Everything was going blurry and cold and dim around him. Draco was pressing a fist to his own chest, his teeth clenched. Distantly, Harry could hear his breath coming in gulps, almost sobs.</p>\n<p>Then abruptly Draco leaned over and put both his hands on Harry\u2019s chest, over the wound. Harry gasped. The pain flared for a moment, getting <em>worse</em>, and Draco made a strangled, gargling noise. But he didn\u2019t move his hands, and abruptly the stabbing pain started to fade from under them. <em>All</em> the pain started to fade, so fast Harry could feel it ebbing, warmth and light rolling back into the world in its place. His ribs creaked, shifting back to position, skin closing up over them. He gasped for breath, in relief, pins and needles prickling all over his arms and legs.</p>\n<p>Draco was still bent over him, his hands warm and heavy over Harry\u2019s heart. Harry managed to reach up and put his own hand weakly over Draco\u2019s. He meant it as <em>I\u2019m all right</em>, <em>you can stop now</em>, but Draco didn\u2019t let go. His teeth were clenched, his neck straining like he was still trying to fix something, and slowly a strange, horrible sensation began creeping all over Harry\u2019s body, like\u2014like there was something else wrong, something so deep he hadn\u2019t even noticed it was there before.</p>\n<p>But now it <em>hurt</em>, it hurt so much there were tears starting in his eyes, and tears dripping on him\u2014<em>Draco</em> was crying with it, his whole face screwed up desperately and still <em>pulling</em>. Harry started trying blindly to <em>push</em> at it, too. He didn\u2019t know what it <em>was</em>, but he could feel it now, a horrible filmy thing over every part of him that didn\u2019t want to come off. They both yelled together, a wordless furious final push, and abruptly Draco was toppling back from him, hands covered with blood and something worse, something green and miasmic clinging to his hand, and it was out, it was <em>out</em>.</p>\n<p>Harry was shaking all over, gasping, but he pushed himself up wobbly. Draco was frantically wiping his hand off on the dirt; Harry grabbed Draco\u2019s wrist. \u201c<em>Scourgify!</em>\u201d he said, hoarsely. The stuff finally and reluctantly dripped off Draco\u2019s fingers and fell sizzling to the ground, leaving his hand clean.</p>\n<p>They collapsed back to the ground together, side by side, panting. Harry felt\u2014different. He couldn\u2019t put his finger on how exactly, but after a moment more, he started to notice that Draco was pressed up against him, and it wasn\u2019t a <em>relief</em>. It didn\u2019t feel like something had stopped bothering him. It just felt <em>good</em>. Harry reached out and tentatively touched Draco\u2019s hand, bare skin to bare skin.</p>\n<p>Draco opened his eyes and looked down at where their hands were touching. He looked back up. \u201cHarry\u2014\u201d Then he stopped and pushed himself up sitting, staring down at him.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Harry said warily. He sat up too.</p>\n<p>Draco said slowly, \u201cYour scar\u2019s gone.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry put his hands up, feeling all over his forehead. The skin was smooth, unbroken. Draco was right. The lightning bolt scar had disappeared. Harry dropped his hands. \u201cI don\u2019t understand,\u201d he said helplessly. \u201cWhat does that even <em>mean</em>?\u201d He looked over at the still-smoking dirt where they\u2019d wiped off the horrible <em>stuff</em> Draco had pulled out of him. \u201cWhat did you do?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou know what I did,\u201d Draco said flatly. He got up. He walked away from Harry\u2014all the way back to the wall. He finally turned around there, twenty yards and more away, and Harry scrambled up to his feet, realizing only then that the pull wasn\u2019t there anymore, tugging at him. They weren\u2019t leashed together anymore.</p>\n<p>There was something else, instead. Because he could still <em>feel</em> Draco over there, almost as if Draco were right next to him. Harry shut his eyes, and he could tell exactly where Draco was, could almost\u2014and then he gave a little push and he <em>was</em> doing it, looking back at himself with Draco\u2019s eyes, and when he opened his own again, he had two separate pictures of the clearing in his head.</p>\n<p>Harry shook it off, pulled back into his body. \u201cAn Indissoluble Bond,\u201d he said. \u201cThe curse <em>did</em> flip over.\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco gave a short hard nod.</p>\n<p>They both jerked around at the <em>crack</em> of an Apparition. Harry grabbed his wand back up from the ground and then stopped: it was Narcissa Malfoy, gripping her own wand. She looked over at Harry, saw him standing there, and her lips pressed together. Draco stood frozen as she came over to him and caught his shoulder, searching his face. Harry could feel him shaking, <em>terrified</em>, he had no idea what he was going to do, he had no idea what came next\u2014</p>\n<p>She said, low, \u201cIt\u2019s happened, hasn\u2019t it. The binding...\u201d</p>\n<p>He flinched, looking away, and she reached up and turned his face back to her. \u201cDraco,\u201d she said. \u201cMy darling boy. <em>He\u2019s</em> coming.\u201d Draco stared at her. \u201cTo the house, now. And he\u2019s ordered us to bring you to him\u2026you and Harry.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMother\u2014\u201d Draco said. She put her fingers on his lips.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou must go, at once,\u201d she said. She reached up and took off the necklace she was wearing, a double string of enormous pearls that didn\u2019t go with her dress. She pressed it into Draco\u2019s hand. \u201cGo to Dumbledore. He\u2019ll protect you. He has to, now.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not leaving you!\u201d Draco said.</p>\n<p>She cupped his face with both hands. \u201cListen to me,\u201d she said, fiercely. \u201cYou\u2019re a Malfoy. That\u2019s more than just us, any of us. Never forget your duty to your line.\u201d She kissed his cheek and pulled him close, for one moment, then stepped back. \u201cGo,\u201d she said. \u201cGo now.\u201d</p>\n<p>She whipped her wand around herself and Apparated away again, vanishing with another <em>crack</em>. Draco just stood there, his face crumpled. Harry could feel a hundred horrible things tumbling over themselves in his head, everything he was afraid of all jammed in together. He looked back towards the house: dark and greenish clouds were gathering overhead above the golden towers, throwing them into shadow.</p>\n<p>Harry swallowed. He picked up their brooms and carried them over. \u201cCome on,\u201d he said, quietly. \u201cCome on, Draco. We\u2019ve got to go.\u201d</p>\n<p>#</p>\n<p>They had to go to ground: moments after Narcissa left them, black-cloaked wizards on broomsticks came pouring out of the house, splitting off in every direction, looking for them. Draco took them diving down into the forest, weaving between the trees. He led the way, but Harry felt the paths like he\u2019d known them all his life, too; familiar glimpses of things he\u2019d never seen before out of the corner of his eye, memories like thorns grabbing at him as he flew past.</p>\n<p>The howling clamor of Hunting Charms rose behind them, baying for blood. A wind was picking up, too cold and bitter for August, and the branches of the trees lashed the air uneasily all around them. The sky was darkening above, and suddenly the Hunting Charms were bursting out of the trees on their heels: glowing red-mouthed hounds with slavering tongues, translucent and ragged, howling wildly, and the Death Eaters were right behind.</p>\n<p>A red flash of <em>Stupefy</em> barely missed Harry\u2019s head; a green killing bolt splashed against a tree just before Draco whipped past, and its limbs stiffened into grey death instantly, pine needles falling like rain around them. \u201c<em>Crucio!\u201d</em> Harry heard a woman\u2019s voice shriek, and for a moment his leg flared into agony as the edge of the curse caught it. He couldn\u2019t think or focus, but he kept flying anyway, his hands and eyes working for a moment without him, and then Draco was next to him, grabbing his thigh, and the pain drained out instantly.</p>\n<p>They wove and darted furiously between the trees, every flying trick they\u2019d learned all summer long. Half a dozen of the Death Eaters ran themselves into tree-trunks or flipped themselves off their brooms, trying to keep up, but there were more of them behind. \u201cAlmost there!\u201d Draco shouted, and Harry couldn\u2019t spare the time to ask <em>where</em>: then the trees abruptly halted, and they were over the stretch of grey marshland, and Draco shot across and landed on the other side.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat are you doing!\u201d Harry yelled, as the Death Eaters all burst out of the trees. Draco pointed at them and shouted, \u201cEnemies of my blood!\u201d and even as the Death Eaters dived, nests of squirming white tentacles shot out of the marshes and lashed around their brooms, dragging them down towards the surface. The marsh-creatures surfaced and started reaching out, grabbing and moaning, pulling the Death Eaters into the swampy ground. They all frantically started firing off spells and curses, trying to get free, and the spectral hounds all halted on the other side, yelping and unwilling to cross.</p>\n<p>Draco jumped back onto his broom, and he and Harry took off again, plunging back into the forest. After half an hour of straight hard flying with no more sign of pursuit, they came to the end of the trees: hills rolling away dotted full of houses, villages, roads rising up and down. The long sunset was still lying over the ground, and there wasn\u2019t any cloud cover. \u201cCome on,\u201d Harry said. He led Draco down to the roadway going past, and put out a thumb as they started walking.</p>\n<p>They were walking for a long time: people would slow down, see they were two teenage boys, and keep going. The sun went down. Draco trudged along next to him, broomstick slung over his back, head down. He ached all over, but it wasn\u2019t anything Harry could make go away.</p>\n<p>Draco said abruptly, \u201cShe did it on purpose, you know.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe wall,\u201d Draco said. \u201cThat was a Triggering Mine spell on it, aimed at you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Harry swallowed. \u201cShe thought you\u2019d let me die?\u201d</p>\n<p>Draco laughed, gasped; there was something half hysterical in it. \u201cShe thought it worked out either way. If I\u2019d let you die, I wouldn\u2019t be Fettered anymore, and we\u2019d have done for you\u2014Voldemort would have to be pleased. And if I saved you\u2014well, your side\u2019s got to look out for me now, don\u2019t they?\u201d He dropped his head again and kept on walking.</p>\n<p>Finally a lorry driver gave them a lift as far as Chippenham, and they walked to the train station. Draco sat down heavily on a bench, his face blank. Harry leaned the broomsticks next to him and went into the train station. Draco had shoved the change from their train trips at him all summer, as if he couldn\u2019t be bothered to understand what a twenty-pound note was worth. Harry found a ticket machine and got them two singles to London, and some Aero bars and crisps out of a vending machine. He didn\u2019t feel a pull at all. He could\u2019ve gone to the whole other end of the platform if he wanted. He could\u2019ve gone anywhere he wanted.</p>\n<p>He went back out and sat down next to Draco and handed him one of the chocolate bars. Draco stared down at it dully. \u201cTry it,\u201d Harry said. Being chased through the forest by the Death Eaters and those hounds, it had reminded him of Dementors. Draco opened the bar and broke pieces off and ate them little by little.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis stuff is terrible,\u201d he said after a while: trying, though his voice wavered a little.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ll get the hand-dipped singing Belgian truffles next time,\u201d Harry said. He reached out and put his arm round Draco\u2019s shoulders, drew him close. Draco shut his eyes and leaned into him. Together, they waited for the train.</p>\n<p># End</p>"
