  "text": "<p>Their arrival on Zou comes with the usual mishaps and misunderstandings, but thankfully it\u2019s not long before these get cleared up and the Dog-Woman (or Mink, whatever) promises to reunite them with their missing crew mates.\u00a0</p>\n<p>As relieved as anyone, but trying not to show it, Zoro trudges through the forest, following quick on Luffy\u2019s heels so as not to get separated. As they walk, Wanda explains how her people have tucked themselves away in the bowels of the woods, partly because their main city is destroyed, but also for safety purposes should the Beast Pirates return.</p>\n<p>Seeing the logic in this, Zoro nods his head in support of the Minks\u2019 strategy, but otherwise doesn\u2019t add anything to the conversation. If he had, he might have noted the curious glances Wanda and Carrot keep shooting him in particular and asked them about it.</p>\n<p>Their arrival at the hidden village is heralded by such a rush of noise that Zoro has to stomp down on an automatic urge to reach for his swords. There are Minks as far as the eye can see, all of them excitedly cheering for the Strawhat Pirates.</p>\n<p>\u201cMan,\u201d Franky lets out a low whistle. \u201cIf only we got this kind of welcome everywhere we went.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re pirates,\u201d Law mutters, lowering the brim of his hat even further on his head. Zoro can\u2019t be sure, but he thinks the other captain might be wishing he could distance himself from them. \u201cGetting this kind of reception on a regular basis would be unusual to say the least.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cActually, depending on who you ask, sometimes it\u2019s normal for us,\u201d Usopp informs him. \u201cIn fact - hey, wait! Is that Nami? I think that\u2019s Nami, and she\u2019s got everyone else with her too!\u201d</p>\n<p>Beginning to wave excitedly, the sniper yells Nami\u2019s name again, followed by Chopper and Sanji\u2019s, both of whom are hot on the navigator\u2019s heels. Franky and Luffy also start yelling, while Zoro and Robin contain themselves to more subdued greetings.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Or at least they do until the approaching three get within reach. Nami flings herself at Luffy, no surprise there, hugging their captain tightly as he gives her a comforting pat on the head, while Chopper bounces gleefully into Usopp\u2019s arms, the two of them already yammering away about all the adventures they\u2019ve had since they\u2019ve seen each other last.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Left with only three other crew mates, it\u2019s a ready expectation that Sanji will start fawning all over Robin in his usual obnoxious way. However, that\u2019s not what happens. Instead, looking wild around the eyes in a way only someone who knows him well would recognize, the cook doesn\u2019t break stride until he\u2019s firmly within Zoro\u2019s orbit and can wrap both hands around his upper arm, clinging tight.</p>\n<p>\u201cHi, darling,\u201d he chirps, his expression desperately conveying that Zoro needs to play along under pain of death. \u201cDid you miss me?\u201d</p>\n<p>*****</p>\n<p>The Minks want to throw them a feast, something they\u2019ve apparently been itching to do since Nami and Co. had first arrived and sent the remnants of the Beast Pirates packing. They\u2019re insistent that it happen immediately, but offer the Strawhats a nearby cabin where they can have their initial reunion in private.</p>\n<p>Since Sanji\u2019s still hanging off his arm like a limpet without any explanation, Zoro thinks that sounds like a <em> very </em> good idea.</p>\n<p>They\u2019re escorted to a room not far away from the main dining hall, but even once there Sanji still doesn\u2019t release his hold. Instead, his eyes keep darting around the room, like he\u2019s expecting any number of unknown enemies to jump out with no warning.</p>\n<p>\u201cCook,\u201d Zoro tries, only to be quickly shushed not by Sanji, but by both Nami and Chopper.</p>\n<p>\u201cIn a minute, Zoro,\u201d Nami says, only removing her finger from her mouth once he\u2019s given her a disgruntled nod. \u201cSomeone will be by to bring Brook our way, so you need to play along until then.\u201d</p>\n<p>Play along with <em> what </em> she doesn\u2019t say, and Sanji gives him a weak smile that\u2019s more of a pained grimace, which is no help at all. Suddenly wishing for a drink, Zoro keeps his mouth shut and tries his best not to fidget while they wait.</p>\n<p>Luckily, that doesn\u2019t wind up being for long. Looking a little worse for wear, Brook stumbles in a few minutes later, with a bunch of canine Minks drooling after him.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Nami\u2019s quick to shoo them away, albeit more politely than Zoro feels is warranted, and shuts the door firmly behind them. Only once that\u2019s done, does Sanji drop his hand like he\u2019s been burned.</p>\n<p>\u201cSorry, Marimo,\u201d the cook says, sounding exhausted as he rubs the bridge of his nose. \u201cI promise there\u2019s an explanation for all of this.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThere\u2019d better be,\u201d Zoro growls, feeling his face heat. He\u2019s pretty sure most of the crew, minus Sanji himself, know about his feelings for the other man, and if whatever\u2019s going on here turns out to be some kind of elaborate joke, he\u2019s not going to be held responsible for his actions. \u201cThe hell is going on with you, Curls?\u201d</p>\n<p>Rather than let his own temper spark the way he normally would at Zoro\u2019s tone, Sanji flinches. \u201cIt\u2019s a long story,\u201d he says, wrapping his arms around himself in an uncharacteristic display of vulnerability. \u201cOne I was really hoping to never have to tell.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell it\u2019s too late for that,\u201d Nami says sternly, seemingly oblivious to the way her words make Sanji wilt even further. \u201cI get that you wanted to keep this private, but it\u2019s out now and everyone needs to know the details if we\u2019re going to manage to pull this off.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI know,\u201d Sanji agrees quietly. \u201cI just \u2026\u201d he sighs then, trailing off quietly before managing to rally. \u201cI don\u2019t talk about this for a reason.\u201d</p>\n<p>Nami\u2019s face softens, and she walks over to give Sanji\u2019s arm a comforting squeeze. \u201cI\u2019m not blaming you, dummy, and I wish your hand hadn\u2019t been forced this way. Unfortunately, we don\u2019t always get what we want.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIsn\u2019t that the truth.\u201d Sanji says mirthlessly, and Zoro knows the situation must be serious because he doesn\u2019t even swoon at Nami\u2019s touch. Instead, he just gives her a grateful nod as he carefully pulls his arm free.</p>\n<p>\u201cAlright,\u201d he says then, stuffing his hands in his pockets in a way that probably means he\u2019s trying to keep from wringing them together. \u201cDo the words Germa or Vinsmoke mean anything to anyone here?\u201d</p>\n<p>They don\u2019t to Zoro, he\u2019s certain of that much. Nor, judging by the looks on their faces, are they ringing a bell for Usopp or Franky. Robin, however, raises her eyebrows in mild surprise.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve never encountered them,\u201d she says, \u201cbut I\u2019m familiar with the names. Germa is a kingdom in the North Blue, and the Vinsmoke are the ruling family. They\u2019re, well, from what I know of them I\u2019d say the phrase \u2018warmongers\u2019 is likely being too kind.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd then some,\u201d Sanji agrees. \u201cThey\u2019re monsters, and Judge, the current king, is the worst of the lot. He also, unfortunately,\u201d and here he braces himself, like he\u2019s half expecting to get hit, \u201chappens to be my biological father.\u201d</p>\n<p>Silence descends over the room, broken eventually by the sound of Usopp clearing his throat. \u201cSo, you\u2019re saying you\u2019re, what? Some kind of illegitimate offspring?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI fucking wish,\u201d Sanji mutters. Then he brushes a flustered hand through his hair before dropping an elaborate bow that puts his usual crap to shame. \u201cI guess it\u2019s a little late, but allow me to introduce myself - Vinsmoke Sanji, fourth child and third born son of the Vinsmoke Family, the exiled Prince of Germa Kingdom.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c \u2026 Say what?\u201d Usopp\u2019s baffled expression speaks for them all, and Sanji huffs out a frustrated noise.</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t make me repeat myself,\u201d he grunts. \u201cI haven\u2019t gone by that name in thirteen years, and I don\u2019t actually intend to start now. The only reason I\u2019m even bringing it up is because my past has reared its ugly head and caught up with all of us.\u201d</p>\n<p>Usopp blinks. \u201cI think I\u2019m gonna need some more information.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sanji sighs. \u201cLook, the long and short of it is, I\u2019m essentially the family disappointment. My father wanted his children to be emotionless, super human killing machines who he could use to help him conquer the North Blue. He got four out of five of those, and tossed me aside the second he could, making it very clear in the process that I was never to tell anyone who I was or where I came from.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThen why are you doing it now?\u201d Franky asks. \u201cNot that I\u2019m saying you shouldn\u2019t, bro. Of course we support you one hundred percent, but what changed your mind?\u201d</p>\n<p>For the briefest of seconds, Sanji looks like he might cry. Then he squares his shoulders and plasters a brave expression on his face. \u201cRemember how we ran into some of Big Mom\u2019s people outside of Dressrosa?\u201d</p>\n<p>Most of the crew make various noises of agreement, and he nods. \u201cWell, it turns out that wasn\u2019t an accidental meeting. They were looking for me. My old man\u2019s trying to form an alliance with her, and I\u2019m his way of sealing the deal.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMeaning?\u201d Zoro asks, growing impatient with all this run around. \u201cGet to the point, would you, Twirly.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sanji shoots him an annoyed look, but it quickly fades into something more akin to embarrassment, and he ducks his head, refusing to meet his eye. \u201cBig Mom, we\u2019ve learned, is aptly named. She\u2019s got something like eighty children, and likes to use them to secure various deals via advantageous marriages. Not wanting to use one of the kids he actually cares about, my father offered her me. The ship we ran into followed us here, and they\u2019ve been sent to drag me off to her territory so I can marry one of her daughters.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell that\u2019s stupid,\u201d Luffy declares, speaking up for the first time. \u201cYou belong with us, so they can\u2019t have you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Once again, Sanji looks a little weepy upon hearing this, but he\u2019s quick to clear his throat and continue on. \u201cI\u2019m glad you think so, Captain, but apparently Big Mom isn\u2019t the kind of person who takes no for an answer. Her goons cornered us in the forest a couple days ago, and that\u2019s what led to the predicament we\u2019re now in.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIn my defence,\u201d he adds, now meeting Zoro\u2019s eye and giving him a sheepish grin. \u201cIt was Chopper\u2019s idea.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI panicked!\u201d Chopper squeaks, bouncing in place when everyone turns to look at him. \u201cThey were trying to take you from us, and you looked like you were considering letting them if it meant the rest of us could get away safely.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s because that\u2019s exactly what he was doing,\u201d Nami says. \u201cIf you hadn\u2019t said what you said, he\u2019d have thrown us out of Bege\u2019s castle and tried to deal with this on his own.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNot because I wanted to,\u201d Sanji protests, and Zoro clears his throat loudly to get all attention on him.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat,\u201d he grits out once he\u2019s succeeded, \u201cdid you do?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cChopper told the Big Mom Pirates Sanji couldn\u2019t go with them because he\u2019s already married,\u201d Brook says, plucking a few solemn notes on his guitar. \u201cMarried, more specifically that is, to you, Zoro.\u201d</p>\n<p>Reasonably certain he must have heard that wrong, Zoro glances around the room, waiting for one of his crew mates to tell him this is all some kind of weird fever dream. Eventually, his gaze lands on Sanji, who cringes in a way that can only mean this whole insane story is legit.</p>\n<p>Taking a deep breath, Zoro points a finger at the cook. \u201cYou,\u201d he says in what he feels shows considerable restraint given the situation, \u201care never going to complain about me stealing booze from the pantry again.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sanji opens his mouth, no doubt to inform him of how wrong he is, but freezes when he catches sight of Zoro\u2019s expression. \u201cYeah,\u201d he says then, deflating like a balloon someone\u2019s just stuck a pin in. \u201cI guess that\u2019s fair.\u201d</p>\n<p>Zoro nods, satisfied that he\u2019s being taken seriously. Then he takes a few moments to collect himself as he runs over the plethora of questions that are currently chasing each other through his head. Grabbing for one at random, he cocks his head to the side and asks, \u201cWhat was with that show on the way in?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBege is still here,\u201d Sanji says tiredly. \u201cHe refused to just accept our word that you and I are, uh, you know,\u201d he adds, gesturing tiredly between the two of them. \u201cHe wants to see us together for himself.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDefine <em> together</em>,\u201d Zoro yelps, a dozen visions dancing across his brain in quick succession, each more terrible than the last.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, get your mind out of the gutter,\u201d Nami says, while Sanji sputters and Brook lets out a hearty guffaw. \u201cHe wants to see you guys interact with each other and judge for himself if you\u2019re telling the truth about being a couple.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhich we\u2019re <em> not</em>,\u201d Zoro says a little desperately.</p>\n<p>\u201cObviously,\u201d she replies, with the tiniest spark of pity lurking in her eyes. Zoro hopes Sanji doesn\u2019t catch it before it vanishes. \u201cHence the whole \u2018show\u2019, as you put it. You two need to put on a convincing act, not only for Bege, but for the Minks as well.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy them?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBecause,\u201d Nami says, now speaking to him like he\u2019s a small child, and a rather stupid one at that. \u201cThere\u2019s too many of them to convincingly keep up the story. One or more will eventually slip up, and then we\u2019re screwed, so they need to believe you guys are together too.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWait, you mean we\u2019re lying to the folks hosting us?\u201d Franky asks. \u201cThat seems kinda cold, sister.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDo I look like I\u2019m happy about it?\u201d Nami asks, whirling on him. \u201cThe whole tribe has been through hell, and they\u2019ve been nothing but wonderful to us since we got here. I hate the position we\u2019re in, but I can\u2019t change it. Unless we want the Big Mom Pirates to keep hunting Sanji down, this is our only option.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay, okay.\u201d Franky soothes, holding his hands up in surrender. \u201cI get it. I\u2019m not sure I like it, but I get it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGood enough,\u201d Nami says. \u201cNow, we should probably get over to the feast before someone comes looking for us, but everyone needs to remember - if anyone asks, Zoro and Sanji are madly in love with each other.\u201d</p>\n<p>Zoro feels at least half a dozen pairs of eyes knowingly peering at him, and finds himself wishing the floor would open up and swallow him.</p>\n<p>*****</p>\n<p>Sanji, Zoro suspects out of guilt, keeps supplying him with all his favourite foods and more alcohol than even he can reasonably handle. They\u2019re tucked away in a quieter corner of the dining hall, close enough to still be part of the festivities, but definitely on the outskirts nevertheless.</p>\n<p>\u201cIf I eat anymore, I will literally explode,\u201d Zoro says after Sanji offers him a third plate of rice balls. \u201cI know I can pack stuff away, Cook, but I\u2019m not Luffy.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, I know,\u201d Sanji says quietly. \u201cI just - ugh. I don\u2019t know what else I can do to make up for \u2026 everything.\u201d</p>\n<p>Zoro gives him a hard stare, noting the tired lines around his mouth and the way he\u2019s sitting with his shoulders hunched defensively. He can\u2019t imagine how it would feel to have a past he was desperately trying to keep hidden bubble to the surface like this, so he decides here and now that he\u2019s not going to make things worse for the other man. He\u2019ll play along even if it kills him, which it very well might.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Greatly daring, he reaches out a hand and curls it loosely around Sanji\u2019s shoulder, hoping the motion won\u2019t get him kicked. \u201cHey,\u201d he says, clearing his throat awkwardly as Sanji peers suspiciously at him through the fringe of his hair. \u201cEverything\u2019s going to be fine, alright? I don\u2019t have a clue why you picked <em> me </em> of all people to help you with this, but I\u2019m onboard. I promise I won\u2019t fuck it up for you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sanji\u2019s eyes widen slightly, and he bites the corner of his bottom lip, clearly unsure of what to say. \u201cThanks,\u201d he says finally, sagging a little further into Zoro\u2019s grip. \u201cAlthough, for the record, I didn\u2019t pick you, so much as the situation did. I couldn\u2019t name anyone already on Zou because the Minks would blow our cover, Franky and Robin are Franky and Robin, and the idea of Luffy in a romantic relationship is frankly laughable. That left either you or Usopp, and we both know his heart belongs to Kaya.\u201d</p>\n<p>So Zoro really was a last resort then. As much as that stings, it\u2019s good to get that confirmation now, right at the beginning, so he can remind himself of it in case he ever starts feeling like this could be real at some point.</p>\n<p>Giving Sanji a faint shake, he pulls his hand back and dredges up a smile from somewhere. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, Curls. I know guys aren\u2019t your thing at the best of times, and not even I\u2019m dumb enough to think you\u2019d ever go for me for real. I\u2019ve got your back, though. As nakama.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sanji watches him with a funny look on his face, his mouth moving soundlessly like he\u2019s fighting to find the words for whatever it is he wants to say. Right when it looks like he might have come across them, however, he\u2019s interrupted by the sound of someone clearing their throat.</p>\n<p>Both Sanji and Zoro jerk around like they\u2019ve been slapped, each of them staring up at the tall, feline Mink who\u2019s just arrived. Based on his spotted coat, Zoro\u2019s going to assume he\u2019s some kind of jaguar, but he suspects it\u2019d be rude to ask.</p>\n<p>\u201cForgive me if I\u2019m overstepping on your reunion,\u201d he says, once he\u2019s sure he has their attention, \u201cbut I felt it was appropriate that I come over and introduce myself.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine, Pedro,\u201d Sanji says, fixing a smile on his face and waving a hand airily. \u201cIt\u2019s good to see you again. How are your injuries doing?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cVery well, thank you,\u201d the Mink says, bobbing his head politely. \u201cBetween Dr. Chopper\u2019s care and your excellent food, I\u2019m pretty much back to normal. As are most of my men.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m glad to hear it,\u201d Sanji says, his smile morphing into something more genuine. \u201cYou guys were looking pretty rough when we first showed up.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhich is why we\u2019re all so grateful, and also part of why I wanted to come say hello.\u201d Bowing low, the Mink offers Zoro his hand to shake. \u201cYour husband saved my life,\u201d he says calmly, \u201cand the lives of numerous others. You\u2019re very lucky to have him by your side.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re not telling me anything I don\u2019t know,\u201d Zoro informs him, gripping the hand with his own. It\u2019s oddly soft, thanks to the Mink\u2019s fur, but there\u2019s no denying the power coursing through the hold. Whatever had happened during the battle with the Beast Pirates, he\u2019s confident this guy would\u2019ve put up a hell of a fight before they\u2019d taken him down.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sure I\u2019m not,\u201d the Mink replies, his grip tightening ever so slightly, \u201cbut I felt it was worth saying nevertheless. Sanji was a great help in driving the Beast Pirates off our island, and his kindness afterwards in helping us rebuild was remarkable too.\u201d</p>\n<p><em> Ah</em>, Zoro thinks, finally cluing into what\u2019s going on here. After all, one hapless idiot is perfectly capable of recognizing another, and he\u2019s always known he isn\u2019t the only person easily swayed by Sanji\u2019s charms. Still, for once he doesn\u2019t have to hide how he feels, even if Sanji\u2019s going to think it\u2019s all an act.</p>\n<p>Releasing the Mink\u2019s hand with a pleasant nod, Zoro proceeds to wrap his arm around the cook\u2019s waist, dragging him over until they\u2019re pressed together side by side. \u201cYeah,\u201d he says, reaching for the mug of ale he knows is around here somewhere with his free hand. \u201cHe\u2019s something else for sure.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cQuite,\u201d Pedro agrees, with only the slightest hint of an edge to his voice. \u201cI also wanted to let you know, you will have the full force of the Mink tribe backing you if you need to fight off the pirates who seem to think he should join them.\u201d</p>\n<p>Zoro tightens his hold on Sanji without meaning to, only relenting when the other man hisses at him. \u201cSorry,\u201d he murmurs quietly, before focusing back on the Mink. \u201cI don\u2019t see us needing the help, but we\u2019ll take it all the same.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFair enough,\u201d Pedro says, clearly sensing this is the best answer he\u2019s going to get. Bowing a second time, he then straightens to his full height and gives them a small smile. \u201cI should leave you two be, however. Especially as I understand it\u2019s been a while since you\u2019ve seen each other. Enjoy the rest of the party, gentlemen.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThanks, Pedro,\u201d Sanji says, watching the Mink until he\u2019s faded into the crowd of revellers.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Zoro\u2019s fully expecting the cook to shove him off now that they\u2019re no longer the centre of anyone\u2019s attention, but if anything the other man leans more heavily against him. Pulling his mug away from his mouth, he glances down at the tousled blond head that\u2019s now resting on his shoulder, hoping like hell that Sanji can\u2019t feel the way his heart rate has picked up. \u201cYou okay?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNot really,\u201d Sanji replies, an admission that he normally wouldn\u2019t make under pain of death. \u201cEverything\u2019s so messed up, and I\u2019m really, <em> really </em>tired. Maybe more tired than I\u2019ve ever been.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSounds like maybe you should go to bed then,\u201d Zoro suggests.</p>\n<p>\u201cProbably,\u201d Sanji agrees. Then he makes a face. \u201cThat\u2019s going to be a problem in and of itself, though,\u201d he says, his nose wrinkling. \u201cThe Minks have given us all private huts to use, but they\u2019re going to expect you and I to share.\u201d</p>\n<p>Zoro\u2019s pretty sure he feels something short circuit in his brain at that notion, but he rallies with impressive speed. \u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d he says, taking a fortifying gulp from his tankard. \u201cI can sleep on the floor so you and your delicate sensibilities get your beauty rest.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sanji pinches him, the motion causing a sharp stinging sensation when his fingers dig into the tender flesh at the crook of Zoro\u2019s elbow. \u201cAsshole,\u201d he mutters, sounding almost like himself for the first time since they\u2019d all reunited. \u201cFuck, you\u2019re going to be the shittiest husband ever, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p>\n<p>Zoro shoots him a grin that he hopes doesn\u2019t reveal too much. \u201cLike you ever thought otherwise,\u201d he says, Sanji\u2019s answering snort echoing in his ears.</p>\n<p>*****</p>\n<p>Zoro\u2019s dragged out of a sound sleep the next morning thanks to a heavy pounding coming from their assigned cabin\u2019s front door. \u201cWhaaa?\u201d He says eloquently, rolling onto his back so he can stare up at the ceiling like it might somehow be able to tell him what\u2019s going on.</p>\n<p>His vision is soon filled with the sight of Sanji, his blond hair a riotous mess of curls, who leans over the side of the bed Zoro had graciously given him to look down at him. \u201cThere\u2019s someone at the door.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo shit,\u201d Zoro grunts, bringing his hands up to massage his temples. \u201cI figured that much out for myself, Curls.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, look at you being more functional than usual then,\u201d Sanji shoots back waspishly. \u201cIt\u2019s not one of the crew, none of them would bother to knock, which means we should get up and see who it is.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou do it,\u201d Zoro retorts with a yawn. \u201cI\u2019m still tired.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s because you\u2019d sleep your life away if someone let you,\u201d Sanji declares. Swinging his legs over the side of the bed, he prods the toes of one foot against Zoro\u2019s hip. \u201cUp, Marimo, and put your blankets back on the bed in case anyone comes looking.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou can\u2019t be serious,\u201d Zoro mutters in disbelief. Unfortunately, the look on Sanji\u2019s face indicates that he is, indeed, very much serious, and Zoro can expect a kick to the head if he doesn\u2019t do as he\u2019s told. Groaning, he rolls over and moves to push himself up off the floor. \u201cI take it back, I think it\u2019s <em> you </em> who\u2019s going to be the shittiest husband ever.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cScrew you,\u201d Sanji replies. He waits, fidgeting by the closed bedroom door until Zoro has the bed sorted to his satisfaction, and then heads out into the main living area, indicating with a wave of his hand that he expects Zoro to follow.</p>\n<p>Since that\u2019s basically what he does every day of his life, anyway, Zoro doesn\u2019t bother putting up a fight. It\u2019s too early for it as it is, and the last thing they need is for it to spill over where someone might see.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Especially, as it turns out when they open the door, this particular someone.</p>\n<p>Zoro doesn\u2019t recognize the tall, slender man with the slicked back hair and lolling tongue who\u2019s standing in the entranceway, but it\u2019s clear from the look on his face that Sanji does. It\u2019s also clear that the cook doesn\u2019t want anything to do with him.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat the fuck are you doing here?\u201d Sanji growls, making a point of fully blocking the doorway, like he half expects the man to try and force his way inside. \u201cIt\u2019s the asscrack of dawn, and we were up all night at a feast. If you have to keep invading my personal space, the least you can do is fuck off until it\u2019s a more reasonable hour.\u201d</p>\n<p>Rather than look offended by this rude greeting, the man laughs, a weird, echoing sound that sets his long tongue rolling. The noise grates on Zoro\u2019s nerves, and makes him reach for a sword he only belatedly realizes he\u2019s not wearing.</p>\n<p>\u201cIs that any way to greet a guest?\u201d The man asks once he\u2019s done laughing. \u201cI\u2019m only here to extend an invitation to you and your,\u201d here he spares a quick glance at Zoro, his lips curving up in a smirk that\u2019s more than a little bizarre thanks to the way his tongue is <em> still </em> hanging out of his mouth, \u201cbeloved.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sanji scowls. \u201cMy <em> beloved </em> is about to start kicking your ass, and I\u2019m going to help if you don\u2019t get the fuck out of here within the next ten seconds.\u201d</p>\n<p>Apparently sensing the sincerity behind these words, the man stops laughing and raises his hands in a show of surrender. \u201cTruce,\u201d he says, his voice slightly more normal now. \u201cI meant what I said about an invitation.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDo I look like I care?\u201d Sanji demands. \u201cI\u2019ve already turned down one <em> invitation </em>from you people, and I\u2019m going to keep right on doing so until you take the fucking hint. I\u2019m not interested in joining you, and I\u2019m certainly not interested in marrying some woman I\u2019ve never met before.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThis has nothing to do with that,\u201d the man insists. \u201cIt\u2019s a personal invite from Father to dine with he and his wife tonight.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWho?\u201d Zoro asks.</p>\n<p>\u201cCapone Bege, captain of the Fire Tank Pirates,\u201d Sanji says. \u201cWe ran into him the first time we were on Sabaody, remember? When we met Law and Kid and all the others.\u201d</p>\n<p>Zoro shrugs. On the whole he tries his best to forget about Sabaody, especially their first go around the island. He\u2019d probably know this Bege guy to see him, but that\u2019s about it. He does, however, recognize the name from last night\u2019s conversation.</p>\n<p>Pinning their intruder - most likely a high ranking member of the Fire Tank Pirates, he suspects - with a look, he feels a strong urge to commit a little violence. \u201cThis Bege guy, he\u2019s working for Big Mom these days, right? He\u2019s the one she sent to drag the cook off to wherever the hell she is.\u201d</p>\n<p>The other pirate nods. \u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d he says, clapping his hands, which Zoro\u2019s just now noticing are abnormally large, together in delight. \u201cAnd he\u2019s concerned that you Strawhats might be trying to pull the wool over his eyes to keep Vinsmoke here from doing as he\u2019s told, so he wants to get a better look at you for himself.\u201d</p>\n<p>A single glimpse of the stricken look on Sanji\u2019s face at the use of that name is all it takes to send Zoro barreling past him and out the door. He hits the other pirate with enough force to bring him to the ground, and wraps a hand around the other man\u2019s throat in a grip that promises dire retribution if he even thinks about moving.</p>\n<p>The man\u2019s eyes go wide, and he clutches at Zoro\u2019s wrist, trying to break his hold as the swordsman leans forward until their faces are inches apart. \u201cCall him that again,\u201d he hisses in his victim\u2019s ear, \u201cand I won\u2019t even bother sullying my swords when I kill you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMarimo!\u201d Having apparently reclaimed his wits, Sanji darts forward and grabs Zoro by the shoulders, hauling him backwards off the downed pirate. \u201cLet him go, he\u2019s not worth it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re damn right he\u2019s not,\u201d Zoro snaps, spitting on the ground next to where the pirate is now gingerly massaging his throat. The odds are about even that he\u2019s going to have an impressive set of bruises dotting his neck by the time the day is out. \u201cTell your <em> captain </em> he can take his invite and shove it up his ass.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Sanji says, startling both Zoro and their visitor if the look on the man\u2019s face is anything to go by. \u201cProvided the dinner is all you\u2019re saying it is, we\u2019ll come.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe will?\u201d Zoro asks, and Sanji nods.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes. I won\u2019t say I\u2019m not offended by the idea that I\u2019m expected to prove my relationship to a bunch of spectators, but if it gets these idiots out of our lives faster, then I\u2019m all for it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Forcing himself to set aside the rage that\u2019s still kicking hot across his skin, Zoro takes a moment to consider this. There\u2019s a logic to what Sanji\u2019s saying, even if he too thinks this whole situation is ridiculous.</p>\n<p>\u201cFine,\u201d he grits out, barely resisting the urge to take the Fire Tank Pirate\u2019s knees out from under him as he climbs gingerly to his feet. \u201cIf that\u2019s what you want, then that\u2019s what we\u2019ll do.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOi, long arms,\u201d he says, directing his comment at the pirate. \u201cExactly where does your boss want this supper to take place?\u201d</p>\n<p>Rubbing his neck theatrically, the other man grins. \u201cWhy, in his castle, of course.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPlease,\u201d Zoro scoffs. \u201cLike hell are we waltzing into enemy territory without any backup. Tell him to come here.\u201d</p>\n<p>Now the pirate scowls, his hand falling to hang at his side, resting right above one of the revolvers he has holstered on his hip. \u201cFather doesn\u2019t take orders. He only gives them.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI find that hard to believe given how he\u2019s now an Emperor\u2019s subordinate,\u201d Sanji says snidely. \u201cHowever, I think we can all agree on a compromise. Zoro and I will meet you in the castle, but Bege has to park it in the middle of the Mink\u2019s territory, and our friends will be waiting nearby if he tries to run with us inside.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s not my call to make - \u201d the man starts to say, but Sanji cuts him off with a disdainful look that shouldn\u2019t be doing what it is to Zoro\u2019s insides.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s the best you\u2019re getting,\u201d the cook says firmly. \u201cMossball and I will be waiting in the village square for six o\u2019clock. If your captain doesn\u2019t show, that\u2019s his problem.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNow,\u201d he adds, eyes narrowing in irritation. \u201cGet the hell out of my sight.\u201d</p>\n<p>Neither of them says a word until the Fire Tank Pirate is out of view, and then a single shared glance is enough for both of them to agree to take any conversation inside. The door closes behind them with a quiet click, and Zoro runs a hand through his hair while Sanji huffs out a tired sigh.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat a morning,\u201d the blond groans, letting his head fall back against the closed door with a soft thump. \u201cI can\u2019t believe this is happening.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou and me both,\u201d Zoro mutters, now scrubbing the same hand over his face. When he moves it, he opens his eye to find Sanji peering at him. \u201cWhat?\u201d He asks warily.</p>\n<p>\u201cNothing,\u201d the cook says, quickly looking away and rubbing at the back of his neck with one hand. \u201cJust, uh, wanted to say thanks for how seriously you\u2019re committing to the bit.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHuh?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe bit,\u201d Sanji repeats, flapping a hand like that might somehow clarify whatever point he\u2019s trying to make. \u201cYou know, the whole tackling Bege\u2019s henchman thing,\u201d he explains when Zoro continues to stare at him. \u201cIt was a good idea. Very devoted husband-esque.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh.\u201d Zoro shrugs, trying his best to seem indifferent. In reality, he hadn\u2019t been thinking about keeping up appearances at all. He\u2019d simply seen Sanji\u2019s expression and reacted accordingly. \u201cWhatever,\u201d he says lamely. \u201cIt\u2019s not a big deal.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI never said it was,\u201d Sanji sniffs irritably. Knowing him, he\u2019s probably trying to save face after saying something complimentary about Zoro. \u201cWas only pointing out a fact. Anyway, I\u2019m going to get breakfast started. Do you want anything?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI could eat.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGreat. You can have first dibs at the shower while I do that then.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI showered yesterday,\u201d Zoro says.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd if you\u2019re going to be married to me, you\u2019re going to keep right on making that be a regular occurance,\u201d Sanji says loftily. \u201cGet moving, kelp-for-brains.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPriss.\u201d</p>\n<p>*****</p>\n<p>Nami comes to find them not long before they were planning to depart. \u201cBege\u2019s castle just rolled into the village,\u201d she says without preamble. \u201cIt looks like he\u2019s agreed to your terms.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGreat,\u201d Zoro says sarcastically. \u201cI guess that means we can take our show on the road.\u201d</p>\n<p>She once again gives him a smile that\u2019s edged with pity. \u201cGuess so,\u201d she says. \u201cHave you guys come up with a story for when he inevitably grills you about how you got together?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNot to worry, Nami dear,\u201d Sanji calls from where he\u2019s cleaning their cabin\u2019s already spotless kitchen as a form of stress relief. \u201cWe spent the afternoon hashing out all those details.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGood enough,\u201d Nami says, thankfully doing them the kindness of not pressing for further information. \u201cYou should probably get going then.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHmm, once more into the breach,\u201d Sanji mutters as he materializes in the living area. \u201cI was really hoping Bege wouldn\u2019t show. One visit to that castle of his was more than enough for me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMe too,\u201d Nami admits, looking worried. \u201cPromise you\u2019ll be careful, okay?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t trouble a single hair on that beautiful head of yours,\u201d Sanji insists. \u201cI highly doubt Bege and his men would pose much of a challenge for the Mossball and I, but even if they did we\u2019ll have the rest of the crew, the Minks, and maybe even the Heart Pirates on standby. Everything will be fine.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cRight,\u201d Zoro says hollowly when Nami turns to look at him. \u201cWhat the cook said.\u201d</p>\n<p>She snorts. \u201cVery convincing. Alright, you two, I\u2019m leaving this mess in your hands. Don\u2019t screw it up.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNever fear,\u201d Sanji chirps, elbowing Zoro in the side when he rolls his eye. \u201cI saw that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou were supposed to,\u201d Zoro grunts, rubbing the now tender spot dramatically. \u201cYou\u2019re also supposed to be married to <em> me </em>, remember? Although, why you couldn\u2019t have just said we were dating, I\u2019ve got no idea.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAgain, that was Chopper, not me,\u201d Sanji says, pulling a cigarette from the packet stuffed in his pants pocket and lighting it as they walk. \u201cAnd he said married because he was afraid Big Mom wouldn\u2019t deem anything less than that sufficient to get off my back.\u201d</p>\n<p>Zoro makes a mental note to have a talk with Chopper about stopping to think things through when he\u2019s panicking, as opposed to blurting out the first thing that comes to mind. \u201cFine,\u201d he says aloud, \u201cI guess that makes sense.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt does,\u201d Sanji says, blowing a steady stream of smoke into the air. \u201cNow, let\u2019s go see how convincing an act we can pull off.\u201d</p>\n<p>Zoro\u2019s not sure what to make of Bege\u2019s castle once it finally comes into view, but he decides to dislike it on principle. These people have come in here thinking they can take something of his - for a given value of <em> his</em>, he\u2019s well aware - and the very idea of that makes his lip curl in distaste.</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you \u2026 growling?\u201d Sanji asks warily.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Zoro says quickly. \u201cProbably a couple of Minks nearby.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUh huh,\u201d Sanji says skeptically. He\u2019s finished not one but two cigarettes on the walk over, and there\u2019s a jitteriness to his movements that suggests he\u2019d like to get his hands on a third. \u201cFuck, I can\u2019t believe this is what our lives have come to.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI can always kill \u2018em for you if you like.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI would advise against that,\u201d a voice says from above them, and when Zoro cranes his neck upwards, he finds the jaguar Mink from the other day - Pedro - crouched among the branches.</p>\n<p>\u201cBig Mom is a formidable enemy,\u201d he continues on once he\u2019s sure he\u2019s got their attention. \u201cAnd she doesn\u2019t take kindly to people crossing her.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGot that much, thanks.\u201d Zoro mutters, ignoring the look Sanji gives him that\u2019s clearly meant to tell him to behave. \u201cWhat are you doing up there, anyway?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cKeeping watch,\u201d is the reply. \u201cMy people are stationed all over the forest. If Bege or his crew try anything, we\u2019ll know.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wonderful. Feeling not unlike a bug under a microscope, Zoro waits until Sanji\u2019s murmured a quiet note of thanks before tugging the cook forward with him.</p>\n<p>The castle grows bigger and bigger the closer they get, its stone walls and turrets looking completely out of place among the wooden structures favoured by the Mink tribe. Zoro\u2019s half tempted to make a joke about overcompensating for something, but then a familiar shape steps out to greet them, and he scowls instead.</p>\n<p>Following his gaze, Sanji snorts. \u201cYou\u2019d think,\u201d he says slowly, eyeing the Fire Tank Pirate from this morning with distaste, \u201cthat someone would\u2019ve caught on that we don\u2019t much care for this fellow and sent somebody else.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019d better not be coming to dinner,\u201d Zoro replies, his fingers itching to reach for any of the three swords that are now resting on his hip. \u201cOtherwise, I really might do something worse than give him a few bruises.\u201d</p>\n<p>As he\u2019d expected, the Fire Tank Pirate is now sporting a ring of marks around his throat, each of which would no doubt line up perfectly with Zoro\u2019s grip if given the opportunity. The swordsman makes a point of eyeballing the bruises as they arrive, and the pirate isn\u2019t quite able to hide the way his hand twitches towards his own neck.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou again,\u201d Zoro says after they\u2019ve climbed the front steps of the castle and are standing outside of the main gate.</p>\n<p>\u201cMe again,\u201d the man agrees, letting out a faint chuckle as they both glare at him. \u201cI\u2019m glad to see you made it, and right on time too. If you\u2019ll follow me, Father is waiting for you in the dining room.\u201d</p>\n<p>Gesturing with one the large hand, the man motions to the door, which slides open, as if on cue. It makes no noise in doing so, and Zoro feels the hairs on the nape of his neck stand up at the sight.</p>\n<p>A quick glance at Sanji shows the blond looks no happier than Zoro feels, and it dawns on him then that, thanks to their situation, not only <em> can </em>he offer up some form of comfort without causing a stir, but it\u2019s probably expected of him. His mind thus made up, he doesn\u2019t bother to say anything before hooking an arm around Sanji\u2019s waist, and tucking him up against his side.</p>\n<p>Sanji\u2019s sole reaction is a quiet noise of surprise, but he melts into Zoro\u2019s touch almost immediately and doesn\u2019t try to shove him off. Pleased with this, Zoro shoots their guide a smarmy grin and nods at the door. \u201cLead the way.\u201d</p>\n<p>The sound of their footsteps echoes while they walk, making Zoro wonder where the rest of Bege\u2019s crew are. They don\u2019t spot a soul on the way to their destination, and when they eventually stop at a set of heavy wooden doors that swing inwards upon their arrival, only a single, solitary figure is waiting inside for them.</p>\n<p>\u201cYour host, gentlemen.\u201d The Fire Tank Pirate says, but rather than join them like Zoro had half been expecting, he waits for them to cross over the threshold and then closes the doors behind them with a nod of his head.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat a creep,\u201d Sanji mutters, and Zoro snorts to show he shares the sentiment.</p>\n<p>\u201cVito\u2019s my second in command,\u201d a gravelly voice says. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll thank you for treating that with the respect it deserves.\u201d</p>\n<p>Zoro and Sanji turn as one to meet the gaze of their host, with the cook jerking a thumb in the swordsman\u2019s direction. \u201cTechnically,\u201d he says with a smirk, \u201cthis one\u2019s the second in command of the future Pirate King. Ask me how much respect I give him when I don\u2019t feel like it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe answer\u2019s \u2018none\u2019,\u201d Zoro adds, as if that weren\u2019t perfectly clear already. \u201cBut I\u2019ll be the first to admit he\u2019s a little shit.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLove you too, dear.\u201d</p>\n<p>Zoro manages to keep every muscle in his body from locking up at these words, and forces himself to take a good look at their host as a distraction. Now that they\u2019re here, he realizes Sanji was right, and he does vaguely recognize the portly man in the tailored suit from their first stint on Sabaody. He\u2019ll be damned if he can remember anything about him, though.</p>\n<p>As if he can sense this, the older man takes a few steps forward, until he\u2019s directly across from them. \u201cCapone Bege,\u201d he says, offering his hand to Zoro specifically. \u201cAnd you\u2019re Roronoa Zoro.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo shit,\u201d Zoro says, ignoring the proffered hand until Bege gets the hint and lets it drop back down to his side. \u201cAnd you\u2019re the idiot who thinks he can just waltz in here and steal the cook away on a whim.\u201d</p>\n<p>Bege\u2019s eyes narrow, giving Zoro the sense that he\u2019s not making a good first impression. \u201cTo be clear, it wasn\u2019t a whim. I have my orders, and I tracked down Blackleg here as part of carrying them out.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIs that so?\u201d Zoro asks snidely, scoffing when Bege nods. \u201cJust following orders is a nice excuse. I hear you\u2019re married. How would you react if someone tried to kidnap your wife under similar circumstances?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMarimo!\u201d Sanji hisses, but his voice is overruled by the sound of Bege growling low in his throat.</p>\n<p>\u201cIs that a threat?\u201d The other man asks, the lines of his mouth tightening in a way that probably reveals more than he\u2019d care to let on.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Zoro says, immediately backing off. He\u2019s got the information he wanted. \u201cJust an honest question.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHmm,\u201d Bege replies. He still looks vaguely murderous, but his posture isn\u2019t quite as tense as it had been. \u201cIn that case, and speaking of my wife, she\u2019s overseeing the finishing touches on supper, and\u2019ll be along once that\u2019s done. Can I offer either you a drink until she gets here?\u201d</p>\n<p>Figuring it fits the role he\u2019s playing, Zoro raises a questioning eyebrow at Sanji, who snorts. \u201cGo ahead, if you like, but I\u2019m waiting until the food\u2019s ready.\u201d</p>\n<p>Shrugging to indicate Sanji can do as he pleases, Zoro accepts the glass of wine Bege holds out to him, even if it\u2019s not the sake he\u2019d prefer. The taste isn\u2019t bad, and he\u2019s downed most of it by the time another door opens and a female voice calls Bege\u2019s name.</p>\n<p>Bege\u2019s entire countenance softens, and he holds out a hand to the tall, pale haired woman who\u2019s now entering the room. \u201cRoronoa, Blackleg,\u201d he says, inclining his head, \u201callow me to introduce you to my wife - \u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLola?!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c - Chiffon.\u201d</p>\n<p>Both Bege and his wife stiffen, the two of them staring at Sanji, whose attention is fixed firmly on the woman. Likewise, Zoro eyes her as well, finding that she does look familiar the longer he watches her.</p>\n<p>Suddenly it clicks, and he points at her with the hand holding his half empty wine glass. \u201cThriller Bark,\u201d he says, looking at Sanji for confirmation. \u201cCaptain of the Rolling Pirates, right?\u201d</p>\n<p>Sanji nods. \u201cI\u2019m surprised you remember given how messed up you were after that fight, but yeah, that\u2019s what I was thinking too.\u201d</p>\n<p>Zoro rolls his good eye and knocks back the rest of his drink. \u201cThe woman proposed to me out of the blue. Twice.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLucky you, I only got the one.\u201d</p>\n<p>Any further bickering is cut off by the woman - Chiffon, apparently - stepping forward anxiously. \u201cYou know my sister?\u201d She asks, her voice tinged with hope.</p>\n<p>\u201cUh, yes,\u201d Sanji says. \u201cNot well, I\u2019m afraid, but we met her a couple years ago. Our crews were briefly allies in a fight against Gecko Moria. Though, I guess you could say we\u2019re still allies. She and our navigator became good friends.\u201d</p>\n<p>Zoro doesn\u2019t really remember that, doesn\u2019t remember much of Thriller Bark after his run in with Kuma, but Sanji had been awake for everything that came after. If either of them could give this woman more details, it\u2019d be him.</p>\n<p>\u201cLola and I are twins,\u201d Chiffon is saying now. \u201cI\u2019m a little bit older, being our Mama\u2019s twenty-second daughter, while Lola\u2019s her twenty-third.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTwenty -?\u201d Zoro starts, and then groans when he realizes what that has to mean. \u201cYou\u2019re a Charlotte.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMhm,\u201d Chiffon says with a bright smile and a nod. \u201cThat I am. Your Blackleg and I would have been in-laws if you weren\u2019t in the picture.\u201d</p>\n<p>Zoro gives her a smile with too much teeth if the way Sanji digs an elbow into his ribs is anything to go by. \u201cDon\u2019t mind him,\u201d the cook says, flashing her a sunny smile of his own. \u201cHe\u2019s a bit of a brute, I\u2019m afraid.\u201d</p>\n<p>Chiffon giggles and points at Bege. \u201cIf you want a brute, you should see this one in the morning before he\u2019s had his coffee.\u201d</p>\n<p>His face flushing, Bege makes a disgruntled noise, and nods towards the table, which is steadily filling up with food under mysterious circumstances. \u201cWe should eat before the meal gets cold.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cEat <em> and </em>chat,\u201d Chiffon insists. \u201cWe hardly ever get to have company, and I want to enjoy the evening. I\u2019d also love to hear more about how you met Lola and how she\u2019s doing.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShe was good the last time we saw her, but that was over two years ago now,\u201d Sanji says, taking a seat at the table. He waits until the Capones take the two seats across from him, and then motions for Zoro to settle in the chair on his left. \u201cNow that I think about it, I\u2019m pretty sure she mentioned having a mother who was a famous pirate.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cVery famous,\u201d Chiffon agrees. \u201cBut that\u2019s not important, tell me about this Thriller Bark place.\u201d</p>\n<p>So Sanji does, weaving a truncated version of their fight against Moria and his zombie army. True to form, he mentions Perona in a more favourable light than Zoro feels she deserves, but doesn\u2019t pull his punches when talking about the gross stuff Moria\u2019d been up to.</p>\n<p>\u201cMoria hasn\u2019t been seen since Marineford,\u201d Bege comments idly during a brief lull in the conversation. \u201cYour captain know anything about that?\u201d</p>\n<p>Zoro and Sanji shrug in tandem, neither of them able to shed any light on the matter. Then Sanji starts talking about the party their crews had thrown once Moria was defeated, spewing tales that have to be exaggerated.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat didn\u2019t happen,\u201d Zoro says, after the cook\u2019s painted a picture of Luffy hanging upside down from a piano while Brook tried to play it. \u201cNo way.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Sanji says. \u201cHave you met our captain? First of all, it most certainly <em> did</em>, and second of all, how would you know one way or the other? You were busy being a comatose lump throughout the entire bash. Thank you for all the grey hairs you gave me that week, by the way.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWas he very badly injured?\u201d Chiffon asks, her brow furrowed with worry.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, he only tried to kill himself,\u201d Sanji declares, ignoring Zoro\u2019s increasingly vocal protests about how that wasn\u2019t how it\u2019d gone down. \u201cWalked right up to Bartholomew Kuma, like a lamb to the fucking slaughter - please pardon my language - and offered him his own head in exchange for Luffy\u2019s.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy was Kuma there?\u201d Bege asks, looking intrigued.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe showed up at the tail end of the fight, no idea why,\u201d Zoro says before Sanji can get going again. \u201cAlso, that was <em> not </em>what happened. I didn\u2019t go into it expecting to die, I was just willing to if it came to it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBecause that\u2019s <em> so </em> much better,\u201d Sanji says acerbically.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Without stopping to consider what he\u2019s saying, Zoro pins him with a look. \u201cDid you ever think,\u201d he says tightly, \u201cthat I might have been just as motivated by you trying to get there first? You stood in front me and told me to tell the others we\u2019d need to find a new cook.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAfter which you knocked me out cold to stop me, bastard.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd I\u2019d do it,\u201d Zoro says seriously, \u201ca thousand times over. If not more.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sanji\u2019s eye widens, and Zoro realizes he\u2019s likely said too much, given <em> away </em>too much. He desperately racks his brain for something, anything he can say to claw the words back from the brink, but before he can come up with an excuse, Chiffon lets out a tiny laugh.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd you thought they might be faking,\u201d she says, giving her husband a teasing smile. \u201cYou\u2019ve got egg on your face now, don\u2019t you dear?\u201d</p>\n<p>Bege grumbles something unintelligible under his breath, but gives her a grudging nod. \u201cI\u2019ll admit, I might have miscalculated. Between this and Vito\u2019s earlier run in with them, I\u2019m willing to bet they\u2019re legit.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m so happy we\u2019ve sufficiently proven our marital status,\u201d Sanji says dryly, every ounce the picture of wronged innocence. \u201cNot to sour the mood of the evening, but you really did have some nerve accusing me of lying about being in a relationship.\u201d</p>\n<p>Bege\u2019s eyes flash, reminding Zoro that he\u2019s a member of the Worst Generation for a reason, and his lips thin in annoyance. \u201cMaybe I was wrong about some stuff,\u201d he says darkly, \u201cbut you can\u2019t convince me you haven\u2019t been lying to an extent. I saw the look on your friends\u2019 faces when I brought up the Vinsmoke. They had no idea what I was talking about.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sanji\u2019s face flushes a brilliant scarlet, his temper visible for all to see, but Bege isn\u2019t done yet. He keeps right on talking, only this time he directs his attention at Zoro.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDid <em> you </em>at least know?\u201d He asks. \u201cI\u2019d like to think you\u2019d\u2019ve been made privy to his past before you married him, but I\u2019m not willing to put money on it. Tell me the truth, kid. Did you show up on Zou and find out Blackleg here wasn\u2019t who you thought he was?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo what if I did?\u201d Zoro asks, his tone as calm as Bege\u2019s is aggravated. \u201cHe\u2019s allowed his secrets.\u201d</p>\n<p>Bege\u2019s face goes slack and he stares at Zoro, completely floored. \u201cYou can\u2019t be serious,\u201d he says, shaking his head as he finds his voice. \u201cThere\u2019s no way you can just brush off something that major.\u201d</p>\n<p>Since that\u2019s exactly what he\u2019s done, Zoro shrugs. \u201cWhere he came from doesn\u2019t change who he is now. I know him better than anyone - his strengths, his weaknesses, his goals, his passions, you name it. Whether or not I also know his old man is fucking irrelevant.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou do.\u201d Sanji says quietly, effectively drawing all eyes to him. It\u2019s Zoro whose gaze he meets, however. \u201cMy father, I mean. You met him back in the East Blue.\u201d</p>\n<p>Zoro has a sudden vision of a crotchety old chef who\u2019d looked at Sanji like he was the greatest gift he\u2019d ever been given, even though you\u2019d never know it to hear the man speak. Unable to help himself, he laughs.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re right, I did,\u201d he says. \u201cGrumpy old bastard didn\u2019t much care for me, did he? Though I guess me getting hacked open right in front of his door probably didn\u2019t make the greatest first impression.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, it definitely left <em> an </em>impression,\u201d Sanji concedes. His voice is still strained, though, which makes Zoro turn back to Bege, wanting to make his position on this bullshit abundantly clear.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhere he came from is irrelevant,\u201d he says, \u201cexcept insofar as how much the people who hurt him deserve to get their asses kicked for it. I don\u2019t know how much you were told, but they treated him like shit. Why should he have to relive all that just to keep me in the loop?\u201d Piercing Bege with a look, he decides to go in for the kill and asks quietly, \u201cWould you judge Chiffon for choosing to keep bad memories to herself?\u201d</p>\n<p><em> Got him</em>, he thinks when Bege\u2019s expression melts. He\u2019d figured he was right earlier, but the way the older pirate glances at his partner confirms it. For all his faults, the man is utterly devoted to his wife, and wouldn\u2019t even dream of taking something out on her if their positions were reversed.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The room\u2019s silent for a moment until Bege leans back in his chair and has the nerve to toast Zoro with his glass before taking a sip from it. \u201cYou\u2019re good, Roronoa,\u201d he says, sounding almost impressed. \u201cMuch better than the newsreels give you credit for.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not his fault if people underestimate him.\u201d Sanji\u2019s voice is a little ragged when he speaks, and there\u2019s a decidedly glassy sheen to his eyes when Zoro risks a peek at him. \u201cAnd they do. All the time.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI believe you,\u201d Bege says. And then, because Zoro\u2019s life, when you get down to it, really is one big, cosmic joke, he follows this up with, \u201cYou\u2019ve got yourself a good one there, kid.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sanji bites his lip, obviously having no idea how to safely respond to this, so Zoro yet again takes it upon himself to provide a distraction. In arguably one of the most selfish moves he\u2019s ever made, he reaches out to snag Sanji\u2019s left hand before bringing it to his lips so he can press a kiss to the back of it.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m the lucky one,\u201d he says, projecting all the sincerity he can into the words.</p>\n<p>Sanji\u2019s hand spasms, the twitches evident where his skin is still brushing up against Zoro\u2019s mouth. \u201cOh, you fucking moss-riddled bastard,\u201d he chokes, thumping the table with his free hand. \u201cWe are in <em> public.</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>And the odds of Zoro ever getting a chance like this again are slim to none. He\u2019s never claimed to be a good man, and the notion of being able to take things he wanted has always been part of the appeal of becoming a pirate.</p>\n<p>Rather than saying any of this, however, he goes back to his meal.</p>\n<p>*****</p>\n<p>It\u2019s dark by the time they leave. Bege sees them off with a curt nod and an assurance that he\u2019ll deliver a speedy report to Big Mom. The fact that she may or may not choose to accept what he tells her goes unspoken, and even Chiffon\u2019s smile is a little strained as she waves them off.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t the end of this mess, is it?\u201d Sanji murmurs as they walk side by side towards their cabin.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI doubt it,\u201d Zoro replies. \u201cBut look at it this way - Luffy\u2019s planning on taking down all four Emperors eventually. After he kicks Big Mom\u2019s ass, you\u2019ll be free of me again.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMhm,\u201d Sanji hums noncommittally. \u201cIn that case, I guess the show must go on.\u201d</p>\n<p>About to ask what he means by this, Zoro gets his answer when the cook winds both his arms around his right one, much the way he had when they\u2019d first reunited on Zou. Sucking in a fortifying breath, he focuses on putting one foot in front of the other.</p>\n<p>By his estimation, they\u2019re about halfway back to their cabin when Sanji breaks the silence. \u201cI know you were sort of just playing a part,\u201d he says softly, \u201cbut thanks. For what you said back there. About how I didn\u2019t owe anyone the story of my past. I\u2019ve wanted to come clean for a long time, but I didn\u2019t know how.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPfft, come clean,\u201d Zoro repeats. \u201cYou make it sound like you had something to be ashamed of. Your family being terrible is a reflection on them, not you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sanji\u2019s grip tightens to a point that\u2019s almost painful, telling Zoro he\u2019s misread the situation. \u201cCook?\u201d He asks, suddenly certain that he needs to tread carefully here. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t get an answer immediately, and when it comes there\u2019s a catch in Sanji\u2019s voice that makes his stomach clench. \u201cIt was never them I was ashamed of.\u201d</p>\n<p>Zoro takes a moment to process those words. If it wasn\u2019t his family Sanji had been worried the Strawhats would reject him for, that only left \u2026\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIt was me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Oh hell no, Zoro\u2019s not going to sit here and listen to this. He doesn\u2019t know what poison Vinsmoke Judge has succeeded in lodging in Sanji\u2019s head, but he\u2019ll be damned if he\u2019s going to let it fester any longer. Even though he knows the odds are about even he\u2019s going to get a dress shoe to the face, he takes a deep breath and asks, \u201cWhat did he do to you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat didn\u2019t he do?\u201d Sanji laughs mirthlessly. \u201cYou really want to know? Alright, fine, I guess if anyone deserves the truth after the past few days, it\u2019s you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cJudge is, much like Robin said, a warmonger. He\u2019s also completely insane and obsessed with \u2018regaining the glory of Germa\u2019,\u201d here Sanji flashes an impressive set of air quotes given that he\u2019s refusing to relinquish his hold on Zoro\u2019s arm, \u201c<em>but</em>, what he is above all else, is a scientist.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Zoro says, feeling like some kind of contribution from him is warranted here. \u201cWhat kind of projects did he work on?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFunny you should ask,\u201d Sanji says, the words spoken in such a falsely bright tone that Zoro feels his skin crawl. \u201cHe had two main areas he liked to study - weapons and genetic manipulation.\u201d</p>\n<p>Forget his skin crawling, Zoro\u2019s going to actively be sick. \u201cCurls,\u201d he says weakly.</p>\n<p>\u201cI can stop,\u201d Sanji replies, forever kinder than most people either know or deserve. \u201cIf it\u2019s too much, I can shut up and we\u2019ll pretend like this whole conversation never happened.\u201d</p>\n<p>It\u2019s a tempting offer, more tempting than Zoro would care to admit, but he\u2019s no coward and it\u2019s painfully clear Sanji needs this outlet. That alone is enough to make him shake his head. \u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d he says. \u201cKeep going.\u201d</p>\n<p>The lanterns lining their path cast enough light for him to make out Sanji\u2019s skeptical expression, but it smoothes out a bit the longer Zoro goes without retracting his offer. Finally, he sighs. \u201cI have four siblings. My sister Reiju is three years older, while my brothers and I are quadruplets.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBig family.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMhm,\u201d Sanji agrees. \u201cI\u2019m the third of the four. Third. Sanji. Wanna know what my brothers are called?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIchiji\u2019s the oldest. After him comes Niji. Then me. Then Yonji. Do you get it yet?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Zoro rasps, the numbers rolling around in his head. \u201cYeah, I get it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s how little we mattered to him,\u201d Sanji says then. \u201cWe weren\u2019t people, let alone children. We were experiments, and I\u2019m the one that failed.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re not - \u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIn his eyes, I am,\u201d Sanji insists, trampling all over Zoro\u2019s protest. \u201cHe did something to us before we were born, Reiju too. I\u2019m not like them. I\u2019m smaller, slower, weaker, you name it. I\u2019m <em> human</em>. There are three monsters out there wearing my face, Marimo, and they are so twisted up by whatever was done to them that any shred of humanity they might have once had is long gone. They\u2019re emotionless super soldiers, and that was all Judge ever wanted them to be.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe used to let them beat me, all three of them. He said it was to toughen me up, but I think it was more meant to be a punishment for having the audacity to be born different. I can\u2019t count the number of bruises they gave me, the number of bones that they broke. Sometimes I\u2019m amazed I can cook at all with the way they used to love stomping on my hands.\u201d</p>\n<p>Said hands tighten around Zoro\u2019s bicep, and without thinking he covers them with one of his own, a belated shield to protect the things Sanji treasures most. \u201cNone - none of that makes you weak,\u201d he tries. \u201cYou were a kid, and you were outnumbered.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNot always,\u201d Sanji disagrees. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t always all three at once. Sometimes it was only two, or even one, and I still couldn\u2019t hold my own. Niji used to love to get me alone and make me cry. Sadistic fuck.\u201d</p>\n<p>Well then <em> Niji </em>had better hope Zoro never comes across him in a dark alley someday. Otherwise he\u2019s liable to meet the wrong end of Kitetsu.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Up ahead, he can see the cabin he\u2019s pretty sure is theirs waiting for them. Part of him thinks he should wait until they\u2019ve reached it to ask the question that\u2019s now percolating at the back of his mind, but he suspects he might lose his nerve by then.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey, Cook,\u201d he says, licking suddenly dry lips. \u201cWhat about your mother? Where was she during all this?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDying,\u201d Sanji replies succinctly, \u201cand then dead. She got sick right around the time my brothers and I were born, and spent the next eight years wasting away before her heart finally gave out. Aside from maybe Reiju, I was the only one who cared.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat was she like?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBeautiful,\u201d Sanji says wistfully. \u201cKind, loving, the only bright light in a dark place. She was happy with me exactly the way I was.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThanks,\u201d Sanji says, or chokes rather, his voice now thick with emotion. \u201cIt\u2019s been thirteen years and I still miss her every damn day.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course you do,\u201d Zoro says, thinking of how Kuina\u2019s been gone just as long. \u201cShe was important to you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShe was,\u201d Sanji says. \u201cWant to know what Judge did once she was out of the way?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay, but I can\u2019t promise it won\u2019t make me try to convince Luffy to sail north and hunt him down.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat a sweet Marimo you are,\u201d Sanji coos, his expression on the edge of manic now. \u201cHe locked me in a dungeon, with an iron mask over my head, and threw away the key. Well, metaphorically speaking. There was a key. My brothers used to steal it and come down to kick the crap out of me in between training breaks.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSanji,\u201d Zoro whispers, horrified.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh god, real names. No no, we\u2019re not doing that,\u201d Sanji insists. \u201cYou promised not to think I was weak.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI <em> don\u2019t </em>think you were weak.\u201d Zoro shoots back, hoping like hell there aren\u2019t any Minks lurking around to overhear them. \u201cI think you were an innocent kid who a lunatic decided to torture.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, I guess that\u2019s one way of looking at it,\u201d Sanji admits, still in that terribly glib tone that Zoro\u2019s positive is hiding dozens of cracks in the facade. \u201cIt took me a long time to consider that, though. They all used to tell me I deserved it, and I believed them. Part of me still does.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI can picture the cell so vividly too. Cold and dark and damp, <em> full </em> of bugs.\u201d Sanji shudders, while Zoro\u2019s struck by a memory of teasing him for running from the spiders on Skypeia, and filled with a sudden urge to travel back in time and punch his idiot younger self right in the goddamn <em> face</em>. \u201cSometimes I dream I\u2019m still there.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re <em> not</em>,\u201d Zoro says fiercely. \u201cAnd you\u2019re <em> never </em>going back.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGod, I hope not,\u201d Sanji says. \u201cEven talking about it is like going through a perpetual root canal. I think going back might actually kill me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe only people who will die if we run into Germa,\u201d Zoro says firmly. \u201cWill be them.\u201d</p>\n<p>They\u2019ve reached the cabin now, and Sanji\u2019s quiet as he unhooks one hand and moves to open the door. Then he slips inside, flicking a nearby light on as he goes, which illuminates exactly how haggard this conversation has him looking.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThanks, Mossball,\u201d he says tiredly. \u201cYou know, you can be kind of sweet when you put your mind to it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell anybody,\u201d says Zoro, a man who is currently using every ounce of willpower not to press his luck and ask the cook if he wants a hug. If Sanji actually says yes, there\u2019s no chance Zoro won\u2019t give himself away, and then they\u2019ll have a whole host of new problems on their hands.</p>\n<p>Luckily, Sanji doesn\u2019t say anything further, and Zoro\u2019s able to wrangle himself under control. The cook still looks terrible, though, and Zoro can\u2019t leave him like that. Telling himself it\u2019s a bad idea, but also unable to stop himself, he wanders into the kitchen and pokes around until he finds what he\u2019s looking for.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Sanji asks from the doorway.</p>\n<p>\u201cNothing you need to worry about,\u201d Zoro replies, shooing him off. \u201cGo have a seat at the table.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Sanji asks suspiciously.</p>\n<p>\u201cBecause I said so,\u201d Zoro retorts. Sanji always brings people food when they\u2019re having a tough time, so Zoro\u2019s going to return the favor. At least, he\u2019s going to as best as he\u2019s able.</p>\n<p>The kettle screams at him once the water\u2019s boiled, and he digs around in a cupboard until he comes up with two matching ceramic mugs. Then it\u2019s a matter of letting the tea bags steep while he brings the whole mess out to the dining area where Sanji\u2019s waiting for him.</p>\n<p>\u201cZoro,\u201d Sanji says, his eyes suspiciously damp.</p>\n<p>\u201cSave it,\u201d Zoro says gruffly. \u201cThere\u2019s milk and sugar in the kitchen. Let me go grab them.\u201d</p>\n<p>Neither of them says anything as the each doctor their drinks to their satisfaction, but finally curiosity forces Zoro to press for the lone detail he\u2019s still wondering about. Stretching his leg out under the table, he nudges Sanji with his foot. \u201cYou never said how you got away.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHmm? Oh.\u201d Staring into the depths of his mug, Sanji shrugs. \u201cMy sister, Reiju, she\u2019s not quite the same as the rest. About six months after Judge locked me away, she broke me out of my cell while Germa was invading a country in the East Blue. Cozia, I think it was called. I ran, wound up working as a chore boy on a passenger liner, and eventually I met Zeff.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd now here you are.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd now here I am,\u201d Sanji agrees. \u201cIn a pretend relationship with the world\u2019s most unlikely candidate, drinking arguably some of the worst tea I\u2019ve ever tasted.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHey!\u201d Zoro protests, knocking his foot against Sanji\u2019s again. \u201cWhere\u2019s the gratitude for me slaving away over a hot stove just now? Fucking ingrate.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sanji laughs, it\u2019s weak and wet, but genuine for all that, and therefore one of the best sounds Zoro\u2019s ever heard. \u201cThanks, Marimo. For everything.\u201d</p>\n<p>Zoro taps his foot a third time, confident the other man hears at least some of what he doesn\u2019t say.</p>\n<p>*****</p>\n<p>Zoro wakes the next morning to a heavy weight on one arm and a patch of sunlight beaming directly into his eye. Groaning, he turns away from the blaze and promptly comes face to face with Sanji\u2019s sleeping form. Belatedly remembering that they\u2019d agreed to share the bed before turning in last night, he slowly realizes that the pressure he can feel is the cook passed out on his arm.</p>\n<p>This poses a conundrum for a number of reasons. Currently, Zoro\u2019s traitorous heart and brain have teamed up to remind him how much he wishes this could be reality, while what remains of his common sense is laying out exactly how Sanji\u2019s bound to react if he wakes up and finds them in such a compromising position. Also, his stomach wants breakfast and his bladder is telling him he needs to get up and take a piss.</p>\n<p>All told, just about every organ he can easily name is screaming at him to run for the fucking hills.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Barely daring to breathe, he tentatively shifts his trapped arm, wanting to see if he can free it without waking Sanji.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Naturally, Sanji responds by frowning in his sleep and burrowing even further into Zoro\u2019s chest.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh this isn\u2019t fucking fair,\u201d Zoro murmurs at the ceiling. A few strands of Sanji\u2019s hair are now tickling his cheek, and it takes every bit of his not inconsiderable strength to resist the urge to stroke his hand through them. \u201cWhat did I do to deserve this?\u201d</p>\n<p>The ceiling fails to offer up any answers, which leaves him laying right where he is, weighing the pros and cons of waking Sanji up before he\u2019s ready. He almost made up his mind to go for when the cook takes matters into his own hands and starts to stir.</p>\n<p>\u201cMmh?\u201d Sanji murmurs, one pale blue eye cracking open and peering up at Zoro through the fringe of his hair. \u201cTime\u2019sit?\u201d He slurs, still more asleep than awake.</p>\n<p>Zoro blinks. There\u2019s no handy clock nearby, and with the way Zou moves the position of the au isn\u2019t much help to him either. \u201cEarly?\u201d He suggests, figuring that\u2019s as good a guess as any.</p>\n<p>The skin around Sanji\u2019s eye crinkles as he smiles, then he yawns, causing a gust of warm breath to waft over Zoro\u2019s chest. \u201cHrm. S\u2019rry.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cS\u2019okay,\u201d Zoro assures him, too busy drinking in the sight of Sanji all relaxed and sleep rumpled to care about much else. \u201cDo you have to get up soon?\u201d</p>\n<p>Sanji\u2019s eyes narrow into contemplative slits for a moment, before widening in alarm. \u201cOh shit,\u201d he yelps, surging upwards like Zoro had previously been expecting, and then launching himself from the bed entirely.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m supposed to be helping with the breakfast preparations in the main dining hall,\u201d he exclaims, rooting around for some clean clothes. \u201cThere\u2019s no way I\u2019m not already late.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThey\u2019ll understand,\u201d Zoro says in a tone he hopes conveys what\u2019s likely to happen to anyone who doesn\u2019t. \u201cAnd this place must have plenty of other cooks. Don\u2019t stress over the small stuff.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s my <em> job</em>, Marimo,\u201d Sanji reminds him. \u201cAnd while Zou might have plenty of cooks, I\u2019m the only one with years of experience when it comes to handling Luffy. Inflicting him on a bunch of poor, unsuspecting peons is just cruel.\u201d</p>\n<p><em> That </em>much Zoro can give him, even if it does mean his lazy fantasy morning has now come to an abrupt end. Grumbling under his breath, he fights his way free from the churned up bedding, and proceeds to begin searching for his own pants.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019re you doing?\u201d Sanji asks, causing Zoro to freeze with said pants pulled halfway up his thighs.</p>\n<p>\u201cUh, what does it look like I\u2019m doing?\u201d He asks, shaking the fabric in his hands for added emphasis. \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone\u2019s going to take too kindly to me showing up in the dining hall in my underwear.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, I mean, yeah, you\u2019ve got a point there,\u201d Sanji stutters. \u201cBut I figured you\u2019d want to sleep a bit more before heading over. There might not be anything ready when we get there.\u201d</p>\n<p>Finishing with his pants, Zoro shrugs and roots around for his boots next, remembering too late that they\u2019re out by the front door where Sanji had insisted he leave them. Sighing, he grabs for his haramaki instead.</p>\n<p>\u201cMaybe not,\u201d he says, his words slightly muffled as he hauls the belly warmer down over his head, \u201cbut I\u2019m already awake, so there\u2019s no point in sitting around here. Besides, if I get there early I get first dibs on the food, right?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOnly if you put a shirt on,\u201d Sanji advises, chucking one at Zoro\u2019s head. \u201cGod, you animal.\u201d</p>\n<p>He seems lighter this morning than he has in a while, definitely since their arrival on Zou, if not earlier. Zoro watches him out of the corner of his eye as they leave the cabin, well aware he must have a besotted look on his face as he listens to the other man yammer on about the various delicacies he\u2019s been exposed to by the Minks.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s a far cry from the emotional wreck he\u2019d been the night before, and is obviously the version Zoro prefers.</p>\n<p>Judging by the steady crowd they run into once they step out onto the main path, Zoro\u2019s willing to bet they\u2019d slept even later than anticipated. Sanji frowns, clearly thinking the same thing, so Zoro opts to distract him by flicking him on the ear.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe hell?\u201d Sanji barks, swatting him away with his own hand. \u201cWhat was that for?\u201d</p>\n<p>Zoro shrugs. \u201cFigured it was as good a way as any to get that pout off your face,\u201d he says, grinning at Sanji\u2019s resulting dirty look.</p>\n<p>\u201cJust when I was about to start thinking charitable things about you,\u201d the other man sniffs. \u201cYou\u2019re a brute, Marimo.\u201d</p>\n<p>They spend the rest of the trek bickering between the two of them, earning themselves some bemused glances from more than a few passers by. Luckily, once they step into the dining hall, they spot most of their own crew, plus Law, sandwiched at a single table.</p>\n<p>\u201cZoro! Sanji!\u201d As usual, the first to spot them, Usopp waves them over, and a bunch of their friends shuffle around to make room. \u201cWe were wondering when you two were going to show your faces. How did last night go?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m assuming fairly decent given the fact that Bege and his crew departed from Zou several hours ago,\u201d Robin says.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThey did?\u201d Zoro asks. He settles down on the bench next to Nami, leaving enough space for Sanji to join him if he so chooses. As expected, however, the cook waves off the offer and continues on towards his intended destination of the kitchen.</p>\n<p>\u201cRobin and I watched them leave ourselves,\u201d Franky says, effectively dragging Zoro\u2019s attention away from Sanji\u2019s retreating back. \u201cAnd given that cook bro seems to still be with us, I\u2019m gonna guess your little dinner date went a-ok.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt \u2026 went,\u201d Zoro says. \u201cDon\u2019t think Bege liked either of us, but he and his wife both bought our act. Speaking of,\u201d zeroing in on Nami, he makes sure he has her attention before carrying on, \u201cguess who her sister is?\u201d</p>\n<p>She raises an eyebrow at him. \u201cWhy would I have any idea?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh come on, you could at least give me one guess.\u201d</p>\n<p>Her eyebrow rises impossibly higher. \u201cDid something happen last night that we weren\u2019t expecting? You\u2019re acting weirder than normal.\u201d</p>\n<p>Zoro sighs. \u201cYou\u2019re such a killjoy. Her sister\u2019s your friend from the Rolling Pirates. What\u2019s her face who\u2019s proposed to like hundreds of men.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLola? Really?\u201d Nami asks, her face creasing with happiness when he nods. \u201cThat\u2019s crazy. Did she say how she\u2019s doing?\u201d</p>\n<p>Zoro feels his own grin dim. \u201cUh, actually she hadn\u2019t seen her in years. Turns out Lola was basically banished by their family for something stupid. She\u2019s, um, also Big Mom\u2019s kid. We ended up being the ones to give Chiffon an update on her.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d Nami says, more somber now. \u201cWell, wherever she is, I hope she\u2019s doing okay.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSpeaking of people who may or may not be doing ok,\u201d Usopp says then, his eyes flicking around the room like he\u2019s afraid of being overheard. \u201cHow\u2019s Sanji?\u201d</p>\n<p>Zoro takes a moment to consider his answer. \u201cHe\u2019s \u2026 stressed,\u201d he says finally. \u201cDoesn\u2019t appreciate all these people digging into his past, or making him think about it in general, but he\u2019s holding it together.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd you?\u201d Nami asks. \u201cHow are you doing?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMe? I\u2019m fine. Why wouldn\u2019t I be?\u201d</p>\n<p>Even Law perks up enough to give him a flat stare, and Zoro feels his face heat under the weight of everyone\u2019s combined incredulity. \u201cQuit it, would you?\u201d He mumbles.</p>\n<p>Nobody says anything for a moment, but eventually Chopper turns to him with his big brown eyes out in full force. \u201cI\u2019m really sorry, Zoro,\u201d the reindeer says, a noticeable catch in his voice. \u201cThis is all my fault. I should have thought before I spoke.\u201d</p>\n<p>He\u2019s sitting too far away to ruffle Chopper\u2019s fur like he normally would, so instead all Zoro can do is shrug. \u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d he promises. \u201cSo long as the cook doesn\u2019t clue in to what\u2019s going on, there\u2019s nothing to worry about.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWow, that\u2019s really \u2026 mature of you,\u201d Usopp says, sounding surprised. \u201cNot that you\u2019re not usually mature,\u201d he\u2019s quick to add, alarmed when Zoro flicks his attention to him. \u201cObviously you\u2019re - I mean \u2026 god, please don\u2019t hurt me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Zoro keeps up the act for a little longer, enjoying the way the sniper starts babbling, but eventually tears his gaze away. \u201cIs there any more coffee?\u201d He asks, noting that a number of the others have mugs in front of them.</p>\n<p>\u201cSomeone should be by soon with a refill,\u201d Nami says. \u201cYou can get some then.\u201d</p>\n<p>Satisfied, Zoro nods and spares the table another quick glance. \u201cWhere\u2019s Luffy?\u201d He asks, confused by the captain\u2019s absence. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t miss meals.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo shit,\u201d Nami replies. \u201cHe\u2019s with Momo and the Samurai,\u201d she explains, referencing their other companions who Zoro had all but forgotten about in the whirlwind of dealing with Sanji\u2019s family problems. \u201cThey want to set sail for Wano as soon as possible.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThey\u2019ll be travelling with my crew and I on the way to Wano,\u201d Law interjects. \u201cGiven the very real possibility that your ship is going to have either Big Mom or Germa looking for you, it seemed prudent.\u201d</p>\n<p>He says this in an even icier tone than usual, but Law\u2019s never liked it when a wrench gets thrown in his carefully constructed plans. What a pity for him then that he\u2019d chosen Monkey D. \u201cChaos Incarnate\u201d Luffy to form an alliance with.</p>\n<p>Rather than point this out, however, Zoro opts not to push his already terrible luck any further. \u201cWhen are we leaving?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s what Strawhat and Kin\u2019emon are discussing now.\u201d Law says, making Zoro wonder why, as a captain in his own right, he\u2019s not taking part in those talks. \u201cBut probably not for at least a few more days.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe <em> Sunny </em> took some damage while escaping Dressrosa,\u201d Franky explains. \u201cBetween that, the fact that Chopper has a couple patients he wants to monitor a little longer, and the need to resupply, we figure it\u2019s a good idea to make sure we\u2019re fully prepared before we take off.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wonderful, that means he and Sanji are going to have to keep up the act for a while yet. Plus, based on what they\u2019ve been told about Big Mom\u2019s spy network, they\u2019re probably going to have to soldier on anytime they\u2019re any place that isn\u2019t the <em> Sunny</em>.</p>\n<p>As if he can sense Zoro\u2019s thoughts, Sanji chooses this exact moment to swan back out into the main hall with a pair of Minks hot on his heels. All three are laden down with trays of food, and the Strawhats\u2019 table appears to be their intended destination.</p>\n<p>\u201cBreakfast is served,\u201d Sanji declares, beginning to set stacks of pancakes down in front of everyone. \u201cThere\u2019s plenty more where these came from, so don\u2019t be shy about digging in, and there\u2019s eggs and bacon coming soon too.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIs there more coffee, Sanji?\u201d Robin asks. \u201cNot for me, but Zoro was just wondering, and no one appears to have brought a pot out with them.\u201d</p>\n<p>In answer, Sanji spins his tray around and plucks a steaming mug off of it. He makes a show of blowing on it to cool it down, and then sets it directly in front of Zoro. \u201cIt\u2019s just the way you like it, darling - no sugar and as black as your soul.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you sure about the no sugar?\u201d One of the Minks asks, leaning over with a handful of cubes. \u201cWe have plenty to go around.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t like sweet things,\u201d Sanji says, gently but firmly as he pushes away the encroaching arm. Then he rests a proprietary hand on Zoro\u2019s shoulder, making him choke. \u201cTrust me, I\u2019d know.\u201d</p>\n<p>The second Mink, a younger female that Zoro vaguely recognizes, titters. \u201cIt looks like he likes some sweet things, Mr. Cook,\u201d she gushes, batting her eyes at Sanji, who blushes a furious red, but doesn\u2019t move his hand.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s debatable,\u201d he says. \u201cNow, would one or both of you mind checking on the state of the eggs. I don\u2019t want anyone going hungry.\u201d</p>\n<p>Both Minks happily rush off to do the cook\u2019s bidding, and Sanji sighs as he watches them go. \u201cNot that these people aren\u2019t lovely,\u201d he says, \u201cbut I think I\u2019ll be happier once we\u2019re back on the <em> Sunny</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShould be soon,\u201d Zoro grunts, which earns him a pleasant squeeze from Sanji that requires him to take a fortifying gulp of his coffee.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s still hot, you idiot,\u201d Sanji scolds when he winces. \u201cCareful that you don\u2019t burn yourself.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cToo late,\u201d Zoro mutters, setting the mug down to give the beverage a little longer to cool off.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Sanji sighs the sigh of the perpetually exasperated, but <em> still </em>doesn\u2019t move his hand. \u201cThe Minks have offered us full use of their food storage facilities, so I\u2019m probably going to spend most of the day restocking our supplies. I don\u2019t suppose you\u2019d care to help?\u201d</p>\n<p>His thumb is now stroking over the plain of Zoro\u2019s neck in short, little sweeps, effectively robbing him of all coherent thought. \u201cUh, sure,\u201d he says belatedly, only partially aware of what he\u2019s agreeing to. \u201cI could do that.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sanji gives him a pleased smile, one of the genuine ones that do awful, terrible things to Zoro\u2019s insides. \u201cGreat,\u201d he says brightly. \u201cThanks, Mossy. We\u2019ll head out as soon as we\u2019re done eating, and anyone else who\u2019d care to join us should feel free.\u201d</p>\n<p>The rest of the crew - traitorous bastards to a man - suddenly have a whole host of other things they need to do today. Some of them sound legit, while most are decidedly less so. Zoro doesn\u2019t care what Usopp says, the man does not have a pressing weight lifting regimen he needs to attend to.</p>\n<p>For once, Sanji doesn\u2019t seem overly bothered by the lack of assistance. Shaking Zoro\u2019s shoulder slightly, he lets out a quiet chuckle. \u201cLooks like it\u2019s just you and me, sweetheart,\u201d he says, and then proceeds to do more damage than any enemy Zoro\u2019s ever faced by leaning over and pressing a quick kiss to his cheek.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll come find you when I\u2019m ready to leave,\u201d he says, his own cheeks dusted a light rosy pink as he pulls back.</p>\n<p>\u201cSure,\u201d Zoro squeaks, the sound that comes out of his mouth more akin to something that might be heard from Chopper or Usopp. He stares resolutely ahead of himself as Sanji bustles off, hardly daring to breathe.</p>\n<p>Nobody says a word at the table for at least a minute, until finally Franky awkwardly clears his throat. \u201cYou, uh, okay there, Zo-Bro?\u201d</p>\n<p>Zoro has no idea what his face is doing right now, and nor does he want to. \u201cIs he back in the kitchen yet?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUh, yeah. Why do you ask?\u201d</p>\n<p>In answer, Zoro slams his head against the tabletop, hard enough he\u2019s surprised it doesn\u2019t break.</p>\n<p>\u201cAh.\u201d</p>\n<p>*****</p>\n<p>Sanji hadn\u2019t been kidding when he\u2019d said he had a lot of restocking to do. Gathering the supplies he\u2019s after takes up most of the day, so much so that there\u2019s no way they\u2019re going to be able to do both that <em> and </em> transport it all the way down to the <em> Sunny </em>in on go, thanks to the size of Zunesha.</p>\n<p>As such, the cook declares that the actual moving of the hood will be tomorrow\u2019s project, and contents himself with gathering and packaging everything for now. It\u2019s then moved to the outskirts of the island, where it can start being moved first thing in the morning.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s enough activity that they\u2019re both exhausted by the end of the day - although Zoro still thinks Sanji\u2019s issues are partly a result of emotional strain - and they don\u2019t make it back to the cabin until well after the sun has set.</p>\n<p>They have a brief argument over the sleeping arrangements where Zoro attempts to reclaim his previous spot on the floor, but Sanji is having none of it. The cook is oddly insistent that it\u2019s not fair for him to do that on top of everything else he\u2019s already taken on, and Zoro resigns himself to caving in the face of Sanji\u2019s resolute expression.</p>\n<p>Telling himself he\u2019ll just stay strong and keep himself to the far end of the bed so as to avoid any further instances of accidental cuddling, Zoro drifts off into a fitful sleep that\u2019s ultimately interrupted by a flailing knee to his back in the middle of the night.</p>\n<p>At first he doesn\u2019t know what\u2019s happening, mildly disoriented because his back is now throbbing, yet his observation haki is convinced there are no enemies in sight. Then he registers the faint sound of a choked off whimper, and it dawns on him that there\u2019s an enemy present, alright, just not necessarily one he can fight.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Zoro\u2019s no stranger to sharing a room with someone who\u2019s having a nightmare. They all get them at times, it\u2019s inevitable with the lives they lead, but it\u2019s different when he and the person are in the same bed. To say nothing of the fact that there\u2019s no one else to step in under the circumstances.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, he\u2019d rather take Wado to his own throat than he would leave Sanji trapped in the throes of a nightmare when he doesn\u2019t have to. Rolling over and propping himself up on one arm, he peers down at the cook, considering his best avenues of approach.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s heard Sanji have bad dreams before, but they\u2019re usually quiet things where he\u2019s restless for a time, only to eventually wake and drag himself off to the galley before anyone can say anything. <em> This </em> isn\u2019t that. Tonight Sanji\u2019s head is jerking from side to side, his limbs are twitching, and if Zoro listens close enough, he can hear words spilling from the other man\u2019s lips, quiet pleas to be let out and promises that he\u2019ll get stronger.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s the cell, Zoro realizes, the one Vinsmoke Judge had locked him in as a child, that\u2019s what he\u2019s dreaming about. His own stomach roiling, the swordsman doesn\u2019t think about what he\u2019s doing before curling his free hand around the cook\u2019s bicep and shaking him gently.</p>\n<p>He earns himself another kick for his troubles. This time it\u2019s a hit directly to the stomach, a heavy, instinctive thing that rips all the breath from Zoro\u2019s lungs and leaves him doubled over and gasping.</p>\n<p>Sanji\u2019s distressed noises cut off abruptly as he\u2019s jerked back to consciousness thanks to the cacophony Zoro\u2019s now making. \u201cWhaa -?\u201d He tries groggily. \u201cOh shit, Marimo!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine, I\u2019m fine,\u201d Zoro wheezes, his good eye watering as he braces his hands on the mattress and sucks in heaving lungfuls of air. \u201cS\u2019my own stupid fault for startling you.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo no, it was me - I shouldn\u2019t have - shit. Fuck. Fucking damnit all to hell!\u201d Reaching for Zoro with hands that are still trembling, he paws weakly at his face, like he\u2019s trying to search for an injury.</p>\n<p>Zoro can\u2019t help but snicker as he fends him off. \u201cThat\u2019s not where you hit me, idiot.\u201d</p>\n<p>Part of him is expecting Sanji to laugh too, and for his usual mask to slip into place, such that he can pretend nothing had happened. That\u2019s apparently beyond him tonight, however, because what he actually does is let out a low noise of distress and curl in on himself.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he sniffs, sounding far, <em> far </em> too close to tears for Zoro to handle. \u201cI don\u2019t know what the fuck\u2019s wrong with me. I haven\u2019t been like this for <em> years</em>, but all of a sudden I\u2019m a fucking wreck. I can\u2019t think, I can\u2019t breathe, I can\u2019t - <em> shit.</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>Fisting one hand in his hair, he punches the other repeatedly into the mattress, his breath now coming in short, sharp pants, all indicative of a man on the verge of a panic attack.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Most of Zoro yearns to drag him into his arms and hold him until this passes, but he\u2019s positive that would just get him kicked again. Not even necessarily on purpose, but because Sanji\u2019s too out of it to focus and is likely to perceive most contact as a threat.</p>\n<p>With that in mind - but equally unwilling to sit back and let his companion suffer - Zoro rolls up out of bed and onto his feet. He thinks he hears Sanji make a confused noise behind him, yet doesn\u2019t let this derail him from his trek to the kitchen.</p>\n<p>He finds the counter by slamming into it, wincing slightly when he bumps the spot Sanji\u2019s already kicked. Then he passes along it until he finds the rack where tonight\u2019s dishes had been left to dry after washing, rooting around until he comes up with a glass.</p>\n<p>Glass successfully procured, his next move is to find the sink and the faucet, and he yanks at the tap so he can fill the cup with a stream of cold water. Only once this task is completed does he head back towards the bedroom.</p>\n<p>Sanji\u2019s sitting in the middle of the bed with his head in his hands and the bedding a churned up mess around him. He doesn\u2019t look up when Zoro first enters the room, but does make an inquiring noise when the swordsman nudges his shoulder with the glass.</p>\n<p>\u201cHmm?\u201d He tries weakly, and Zoro nudges him a little harder.</p>\n<p>\u201cTake it,\u201d he says firmly. \u201cIt\u2019ll give you something to focus on, to help break through the panic.\u201d</p>\n<p>It\u2019s a testament to how badly off Sanji is that he doesn\u2019t protest the use of that word. In fact, he doesn\u2019t protest anything, just takes the glass with a shaky hand, such that Zoro doesn\u2019t release his own hold until he\u2019s sure Sanji\u2019s not going to drop it and douse himself.</p>\n<p>The room quiets as Sanji begins taking slow, measured sips of his water, a little of the tension leaching out of his posture the longer he goes. It doesn\u2019t disappear entirely, however, with shudders still occasionally running through his body, and Zoro doesn\u2019t really think about what he does next.</p>\n<p>The bed dips as he settles back down next to Sanji, a few springs creaking as they adjust to his weight. Neither man says anything, but Sanji sucks in a heavy breath when Zoro lays a careful hand on his back.</p>\n<p>Zoro stays patient, waiting him out to see if he\u2019ll say something or try to buck him off. He stays quiet, though, and after a few minutes of stilted silence slumps a little further into the touch. Satisfied he\u2019s made the right call, Zoro starts lightly dragging his fingers over Sanji\u2019s back, moving his hand in gentle sweeps that are meant to do nothing but offer what comfort he can.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Sanji\u2019s breath hitches, the sound a clear indication that he\u2019s not sure what to make of this, but he <em> still </em>doesn\u2019t move away. \u201cYou don\u2019t - you don\u2019t have to do this,\u201d he finally says raggedly. \u201cIt\u2019s only us here. There\u2019s no need to keep up the act.\u201d</p>\n<p>Zoro blinks. Truth be told, he\u2019d forgotten all about the roles they\u2019re supposed to be playing and had reacted on instinct.\u00a0</p>\n<p>He spends a few moments debating with himself on whether or not he <em> should </em> pretend it\u2019s all an act, but shoves that thought aside almost immediately. Instead, he shifts his grip, curls his arm around Sanji entirely, and tucks him up against his side.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not acting,\u201d he says gruffly, but is quick to add before Sanji can get concerned. \u201cWe\u2019re crew. <em> Nakama. </em> I don\u2019t care how much we fight with each other, I\u2019m not going to leave you suffering like this when there\u2019s something I can do about it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d Sanji insists, shoving at Zoro\u2019s chest with the hand holding his now empty glass.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re not,\u201d Zoro disagrees. There\u2019d been no force behind the shove whatsoever. The move had been entirely for show, and is therefore a clear indication that Sanji doesn\u2019t want him to let go, even if he can\u2019t bring himself to admit as much out loud.</p>\n<p>In further proof of this, Sanji doesn\u2019t even bother doing it a second time. Sniffing wetly, he hides face in the juncture between Zoro\u2019s neck and shoulder, his fingers toying idly with the glass in his hands. \u201cI hate this.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI know,\u201d Zoro replies, close enough to Sanji that a few strands of the other man\u2019s hair tickle his lips. It would be so, so easy to brush a kiss to his forehead or his temple. So much so that Zoro has to count to ten in his head lest he actually do it.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not your fault,\u201d he says, once he\u2019s certain he has himself under control. \u201cAnd it\u2019s nothing to be ashamed of.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLike hell it isn\u2019t,\u201d Sanji snorts. \u201cThis is mortifying. I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m this upset by a fucking memory. I\u2019m essentially proving Judge right about how weak I am.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re not,\u201d Zoro says simply. \u201cNot at all.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sanji looks up at him then, pulling his head from where he\u2019s got it buried in Zoro\u2019s shoulder to peer at him suspiciously. For his part, Zoro simply gazes impassively back at him, waiting for the blond to find whatever it is he\u2019s looking for.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou really mean that, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMhm,\u201d Zoro replies. \u201cYou weren't weak in the past, you were just a normal kid, and you\u2019re not weak now. I mean,\u201d he adds, projecting a teasing air into his tone to try and lighten the mood, \u201cyou\u2019re obviously not in <em> my </em>league, but I guess you\u2019re okay.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sanji headbuts him none too gently in the chin. \u201cAsshole,\u201d he mutters. \u201cAnd here was me thinking you might have actually developed some class for a second there. Spoke too soon, I suppose.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, yeah,\u201d Zoro says, relieved to hear him sound more like himself. Then, more seriously, he asks, \u201cYou think you\u2019re through the worst of it?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFor now, anyway,\u201d Sanji admits with a deliberately casual shrug. \u201cEnough to try and get a bit more sleep, at least.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Zoro says, risking a quick glance down at the bed. As he\u2019s noticed earlier, the bedding is a churned up mess, and a quick prod at the sheet finds parts of it clammy to the touch where Sanji had sweated through it.</p>\n<p>Frowning, he draws his hand away. \u201cDid this place come with spare sheets?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUh, think I saw some in the linen closet when I went looking for towels yesterday,\u201d Sanji says. \u201cWhy do you ask?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCuz I want to build a blanket fort at three in the morning,\u201d Zoro drawls. \u201cWhy do you think? I\u2019m gonna change \u2018em so we can be more comfortable.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cO-oh,\u201d Sanji says, belatedly catching on. \u201cThat\u2019s a good idea, but let me do it. I\u2019m the one who made the mess.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNot a chance.\u201d Zoro says, standing in one fluid motion and effectively evading the cook\u2019s grasp. \u201cIn fact, you might want to grab some clean sleep clothes if you have any. You\u2019ve sweated all over the ones you\u2019re wearing.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you saying I smell?\u201d Sanji demands irately. \u201cThat\u2019s rich coming from he who regularly denounces the act of bathing.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDidn\u2019t say anything like that,\u201d Zoro says, already moving for the doorway and the spot where he vaguely remembers the linen closet to be. \u201cBut \u2026 if the dress shoe fits \u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMarimo, for once I\u2019m feeling vaguely benevolent to you. Don\u2019t ruin it by making me want to kill you like usual.\u201d</p>\n<p>Chuckling to himself, Zoro flips him off as he fully exits the room.</p>\n<p>*****</p>\n<p>If Zoro had expected things to be awkward between them the next day, he\u2019s sorely mistaken. They don\u2019t talk about what happened - obviously, they\u2019re <em> them </em> - but nor do they start dancing around each other in some elaborate form of denial either. They simply go back to their usual banter, and Zoro does his best not to read anything into that.</p>\n<p>Luckily, they\u2019re busy enough getting ready to depart for Wano that they wouldn\u2019t really have enough time to let things get awkward even if they wanted to. There\u2019s lots to do in prepping the <em> Sunny</em>, and they\u2019re as big a part of that as any.</p>\n<p>Franky\u2019s rigged up a similar pulley system to the one that had been used in bandaging Zunesha\u2019s injured leg. Only this one goes all the way down the elephant, coming to a rest only a few feet above where the <em> Sunny </em>is moored. The shipwright\u2019s been using it to do his repairs, but Zoro and Sanji, along with a little help from a grumbling Usopp, commandeer it to aid in their restocking venture.</p>\n<p>It takes multiple, unfortunately <em> lengthy </em> trips to get everything down, and then they need to get everything safely stored away. Sanji also insists on cataloguing every item of food that gets brought aboard, an act that sees Zoro nearly weep tears of boredom before the cook throws a fishing rod at his head and tells him he can do that rather than sit around the galley making a nuisance of himself.</p>\n<p>Usopp is similarly gifted with a pole, and the two of them sit in semi-companionable silence by the railing, drawing up whatever they manage to catch and tossing it in the aquarium. It\u2019s peaceful, almost enjoyable even, until the sniper makes a show of clearing his throat.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo.\u201d Zoro says preemptively.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou don\u2019t even know what I was going to say!\u201d Usopp squawks indignantly.</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t need to,\u201d Zoro retorts. \u201cIt was either going to be about how the cook\u2019s doing or how <em> I\u2019m </em> doing. I\u2019m not willing to talk about either of those, especially not with you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWow, hurtful,\u201d Usopp says, theatrically grabbing his own chest. \u201cOut of all the years we\u2019ve known each other, sailed together, had each other\u2019s backs, I would never have thought you could cut me so deep. You\u2019re a cruel, cruel man, Roronoa Zoro.\u201d</p>\n<p>Zoro watches him roll around a little longer, sighing when he rocks too hard and nearly pitches himself over the side of the ship. \u201cAre you done yet?\u201d He asks mildly, earning himself a sheepish grin for his troubles.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, I think so,\u201d he says. \u201cBut,\u201d he\u2019s quick to add, meaning Zoro had spoken too soon if he thought he was in the clear, \u201cI do think you need to talk about what you\u2019re going through. This mess is hard on both of you, even if it\u2019s in wildly different ways.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d Zoro says resolutely, \u201cand so\u2019s he.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cReally?\u201d Usopp asks warily.</p>\n<p>Zoro keeps his gaze focused squarely on the ocean, refusing to let anything show on his face. There\u2019s no way Sanji would be comfortable with more people than necessary knowing how badly he\u2019s struggling right now, and Zoro will keep his confidence unless it becomes an active threat to the crew.</p>\n<p>\u201cHmmm,\u201d Usopp says. It\u2019s obvious he doesn\u2019t entirely believe what Zoro\u2019s saying, but he\u2019s missing enough details to not be able to viably push.</p>\n<p>\u201cFine. Keep your secrets,\u201d he declares eventually. \u201cIt\u2019s not like I\u2019m interested in them anyway.\u201d</p>\n<p>That\u2019s a massive lie even by Usopp\u2019s standards, but if it gets him to shut up, Zoro\u2019s not going to call him out on it. He\u2019s perfectly content to sit right here and focus on his fishing.</p>\n<p>The sound of Usopp grumbling in his throat is obnoxiously loud in the stilted silence. Zoro can feel his forehead furrowing as he\u2019s hit with a sudden urge to fling the longnosed man overboard himself.</p>\n<p>As if sensing where Zoro\u2019s mood is heading, Usopp holds his hands up in a placating gesture, his fishing rod hovering dangerously in his grip. \u201cI know, I know,\u201d he says. \u201cBelieve it or not, I\u2019m perfectly capable of figuring out when you want a conversation to end.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHaving said that,\u201d he continues on in a frankly admirable act given the glare Zoro\u2019s currently levelling his way. \u201cI just want to make it clear that if you ever <em> do </em>want to talk, or if there\u2019s anything I can do to help, feel free to let me know.\u201d</p>\n<p>Zoro grunts, and Usopp sags in relief, recognizing the response for the peace offering it is.</p>\n<p>\u201cGood talk, buddy,\u201d he says, shifting his hand like he\u2019s going to clap it over Zoro\u2019s shoulder and then clearly thinking better of it. \u201cGood talk.\u201d</p>\n<p>*****</p>\n<p>They get the <em> Sunny </em> stocked and loaded, Franky finishes whatever projects he\u2019s working on, and Nami picks up some useful sea charts that are provided to her by the Minks. Once Chopper arrives and confirms there\u2019s nothing further he needs to do for any of his patients, Luffy flings both hands in the air and declares it\u2019s time for them to set sail.</p>\n<p>\u201cNot a chance, moron,\u201d Nami says, driving her own fist into the back of their captain\u2019s skull. \u201cIt\u2019s almost dusk and most of us have been working all day. We should use this time to get a good night\u2019s sleep, and then everyone will be refreshed when we leave in the morning.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAww, Nami.\u201d Luffy whines, rubbing at his head. \u201cThat\u2019s no fair. Torao and the samurai are already long gone,\u201d he points out, referencing the Heart Pirates who\u2019d departed earlier that day. \u201cWhat if they find fun things to do in Wano without us?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFrom what Kin\u2019emon\u2019s told us, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s much \u2018fun\u2019 to be had in Wano,\u201d Nami mutters. \u201cAnd the <em> Polar Tang </em> is faster than the <em> Sunny </em>anyway. Even if we\u2019d left at the same time, they\u2019d still be ahead of us by now.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Luffy demands, looking offended. \u201cTorao\u2019s not allowed to have a faster ship than me when I\u2019m gonna be King of the Pirates. Hey, Franky! Do something to make the <em> Sunny </em>faster, okay?\u201d</p>\n<p>Franky dutifully flashes him a thumbs up. \u201cSure thing, Captain-Bro. We\u2019re probably gonna need more storage space for cola, though.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s fine!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell that sounds like both a recipe for disaster and an idea we need to get out of his head right this fuckin\u2019 minute,\u201d Sanji says from where he\u2019s standing not far from Zoro\u2019s side. Pulling the cigarette is currently enjoying out of his mouth, he curls it between two fingers and waves him to get the captain\u2019s attention.</p>\n<p>\u201cOi, Luffy! You realize if we stay one more night we can probably have a big goodbye dinner with the Minks, right?\u201d</p>\n<p>It works like a charm. His eyes lighting up, Luffy whirls to face them, a small trail of drool already forming at the corner of his mouth. \u201cYou mean like a feast?\u201d He crows, delighted.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, so long as the Minks are okay with it,\u201d Sanji replies. \u201cI\u2019ll even offer to cook to try and repay them for their hospitality.\u201d</p>\n<p>Luffy breaks out into an impromptu victory dance, dragging Chopper and Usopp into the mess with him. Nearby, Wanda and Pedro, who\u2019ve been consulting with the Strawhats to see what their plans are, both nod approvingly.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYour crew saved our island,\u201d Wanda says happily. \u201cAs if we\u2019d ever pass up a chance to celebrate with you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cEspecially if you\u2019re the one cooking, Sanji,\u201d Pedro adds, and Zoro manfully resists the urge to start glaring at the jaguar Mink. \u201cNo one here is going to say no to a last opportunity to experience that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCareful, he\u2019s got a big enough head already.\u201d Zoro warns, smirking when this works exactly as he\u2019d hoped and drags Sanji\u2019s attention away from the Mink in favour of trying to kick his face in.</p>\n<p>\u201cStupid, Mossball,\u201d Sanji grouches when Zoro blocks the kick with Shusui. \u201cOne of these days I really am going to kill you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBring it on, Twirlybrows.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe can\u2019t!\u201d Luffy yells from the pile he\u2019s now in. \u201cSanji, you need to start cooking right away. I want food!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Ugh</em>, shitty Marimo, shitty captain.\u201d Sanji complains. \u201cHonestly, I don\u2019t even know why I put up with you people.\u201d</p>\n<p>The complaining is all for show, of course, and several hours later not only the Strawhats but what feels like half the Mink tribe are scattered throughout the main hall, all of them enjoying Sanji\u2019s delicious food. Even the cat and the dog are being civil to each other in exchange for neither having to stray too far from the buffet table.</p>\n<p>Sanji\u2019s a whirlwind throughout it all, barely stopping at any point as he keeps bringing out dish after dish. No matter how many times people offer to help him, he waves them off each time and then promptly disappears back into the kitchen.</p>\n<p>Eventually, however, even he can\u2019t cook any longer, and the pressure of everyone telling him to take a break lures him over to where a number of people, Zoro among them, are clustered on various chairs and benches, all of them either completely satiated or just about there.</p>\n<p>\u201cSanji!\u201d Pedro calls from his spot on a bench with Wanda and Nami. \u201cCome join us!\u201d</p>\n<p>Sanji laughs, gesturing at first the specific bench the trio are occupying, and then the surrounding area. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t look like there\u2019s any room for me,\u201d he notes. \u201cI\u2019ll have to go find a spare chair or something.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGood luck,\u201d Carrot giggles around a mouthful of food. \u201cThere\u2019s way more people in here than usual.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNot a problem, little sis!\u201d Franky cuts in, and for a second Zoro thinks the cyborg\u2019s about to start building a new seat right then and there. However, instead he plasters a huge grin on his face and points directly at Zoro himself. \u201cThe big guy\u2019s lap is unoccupied.\u201d</p>\n<p>It\u2019s a good thing Franky\u2019s already completed the repairs on the <em> Sunny</em>, Zoro thinks, since it\u2019s going to be awfully hard for him to get anything done after he loses both his arms. He may have one hand already occupied with a tankard of ale, but the other\u2019s fully capable of wielding a sword right now.</p>\n<p>That is, until it <em> isn\u2019t.\u00a0</em>Sanji must be in an especially impish mood - either that or any gods that might be listening absolutely <em> hate </em>Zoro - because the cook gives Franky a look that clearly says \u2018two can play at this game\u2019 and drops himself down onto Zoro\u2019s lap without any further fanfare.</p>\n<p>The action is unexpected enough that Zoro winds up splashing beer all over his own arm, while the other automatically comes up to cradle the cook\u2019s waist, not wanting him to fall. His hand spasms slightly, having no idea where to safely place itself, and Zoro\u2019s pretty sure he sees his life flash before his eye when Sanji gives him an exasperated look.</p>\n<p>\u201cWould you look at the mess you've made of yourself, you big ox,\u201d he says, rolling his eyes at the beer that\u2019s still dripping down Zoro\u2019s arm. \u201cHold on, I\u2019m sure I have a - no, don\u2019t <em> lick </em> it!\u201d He snaps, when Zoro moves to do exactly that. \u201cOh my god, what in the world possessed me to marry you, you barbarian?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUhhh,\u201d Zoro says helpfully, which earns him another eye roll as Sanji starts rooting around in his back pocket for something. The motion sets him squirming in Zoro\u2019s lap, and the swordsman holds himself excruciatingly still, lest he suffer a reaction that will get him summarily murdered.</p>\n<p>\u201cAha!\u201d Apparently having found what he\u2019s looking for, Sanji pulls a pristine white handkerchief free from his pocket and leans over to begin patting at Zoro\u2019s arm dry. \u201cHonestly,\u201d he grumbles. \u201cIt\u2019s like I have to do everything around here.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMy way would\u2019ve worked just as well,\u201d Zoro says, blinking when Sanji flicks him in the nose with the now soiled cloth.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, it wouldn\u2019t have,\u201d the cook says, rolling the kerchief up into a ball and tossing it to where a number of dirty dishes have been gathered by those who are done with them. \u201cAnd don\u2019t you dare forget where that is, or you\u2019re getting me a new one.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re the one who spilled my drink!\u201d Zoro protests, or at least he starts to anyway. Unfortunately for what little sanity he has left, Sanji chooses this exact moment to loop both his arms around Zoro\u2019s neck, and what actually ends up coming out is a tortured squeak.</p>\n<p>\u201cToo much?\u201d Sanji murmurs worriedly, the question covered up by the guffaws coming from a number of witnesses.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Zoro manages to choke out, equally quietly. \u201cNo, you\u2019re fine.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGood,\u201d Sanji replies.</p>\n<p>Across from them, Franky, the bastard, is laughing so hard he\u2019s got tears in his eyes. He opens his mouth to say something, only for several hands to suddenly sprout all around his head, effectively cutting off his ability to speak.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Zoro shoots Robin a grateful look at where she\u2019s planted by her partner\u2019s elbow, and she smiles serenely back at him. A quick glance around the group shows that no one else seems to think anything is amiss, although he could do without the way Nami\u2019s smile is edged with pity.</p>\n<p>Sighing, he knocks back the remains of his drinking, staring forlornly at his empty mug when he comes up with barely half a gulp.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI can get you some more,\u201d Sanji says, his own gaze fixed on the tankard. \u201cSince you can\u2019t exactly get up with me sitting like this.\u201d</p>\n<p>Zoro snorts. \u201cFirst of all, I\u2019m perfectly capable of going to get more booze even while carrying your scrawny ass. Second of all, don\u2019t bother. Someone\u2019ll probably be along with more in a bit, and you just sat down. You\u2019ve been going nonstop all night.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShip\u2019s cook, remember?\u201d Sanji points out. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of my job.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTell that to someone who doesn\u2019t know <em> exactly </em>how much sleep you got last night.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMossball,\u201d Sanji says sharply, his tone laced with just enough genuine ire to make Zoro back off. \u201cI won\u2019t use that as an excuse not to fulfill my duties.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sighing, Zoro lets his empty mug drop carefully to the floor, and then winds his now free arm around Sanji\u2019s waist in a mirror of his other one. Part of him knows he should dump the cook to the ground and play it off as a joke, but the rest of him - the <em> oh-so-selfish </em> rest of him - knows he\u2019s not likely to get this opportunity again and can\u2019t bring himself to pass it up.</p>\n<p>\u201cM\u2019sorry,\u201d he mumbles, as contrite as he knows how. \u201cDidn\u2019t mean anythin\u2019 by it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou better be,\u201d Sanji replies, further leaning into the act by pressing their foreheads together. \u201cOtherwise we\u2019re going to take this outside so I can properly kick your ass.\u201d</p>\n<p>They\u2019re close enough and quiet enough that no one else can pick up what they\u2019re saying, meaning that to the unknowing eye they look like nothing more than a pair of lovers enjoying an intimate moment together. Naturally, this means a bunch of the Minks start catcalling them, and a handful of the Strawhats join in as well.</p>\n<p>\u201cGet a room, you two!\u201d Brook hoots from somewhere in the crowd, while Franky once again starts blubbering. \u201cThere are people around.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sanji lets out an irritated sigh. \u201cOur crew mates are morons. Well, minus the ladies anyway.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s not exactly news, Curly,\u201d Zoro points out, making a face when Sanji digs his chin into the top of his head in reprimand. \u201cKnock it off, jackass.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sanji\u2019s kind enough to stop what he\u2019s doing, but rather than move his face away entirely, he drops his head down onto Zoro\u2019s shoulder, while all of his limbs sag like they\u2019re suddenly much heavier than they were before. \u201cAs much as it pains me to admit it,\u201d he says softly, \u201cI really am tired.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou wanna call it a night?\u201d Zoro asks.</p>\n<p>\u201cI probably should,\u201d Sanji admits. \u201cWe\u2019ve got an early start tomorrow, and it\u2019s not like where we\u2019re heading is bound to be peaceful, but \u2026\u201d He trails off, his tone somber. \u201cWho knows when we\u2019ll be back here again, if ever? Anything can happen out there, and I don\u2019t want to miss out on a chance to spend time with friends.\u201d</p>\n<p>Zoro eyes him thoughtfully for a moment. \u201cYou\u2019re worried about Germa, aren\u2019t you? You don\u2019t think this mess is over yet.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sanji shrugs, which is as good an answer as any. \u201cJudge isn\u2019t in the habit of taking no for an answer.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSucks to be him then because he\u2019s going to get a firsthand lesson in it if he comes at you.\u201d Not caring that it\u2019s risky, Zoro starts trailing a hand over the cook\u2019s back, the motion similar to the one he\u2019d been making the night before. \u201cWe\u2019re not gonna let him get away with any shit.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIntellectually, I know that,\u201d Sanji says, making no move to stop Zoro\u2019s ministrations. \u201cBut it\u2019s still hard to shut up the little voice that\u2019s screaming in the back of my head.\u201d</p>\n<p>That much Zoro understands, and he wishes there was something more substantial he could do to help. Right now he feels oddly powerless, which isn\u2019t something he\u2019s used to, and the very idea of it pisses him off.</p>\n<p>\u201cI can\u2019t predict what\u2019s going to happen,\u201d he says finally, \u201cbut I <em> can </em>promise that you\u2019re not going to have to deal with whatever it is alone. Maybe that\u2019s not much, but - \u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, it is.\u201d Sanji cuts him off, his eyes serious and his voice thick. \u201cIt\u2019s - you don\u2019t know how much that means. You <em> can\u2019t.\u00a0</em>My whole life in Germa - alone is the only thing I ever was.\u201d</p>\n<p>Unable to stop himself, Zoro makes a displeased sound low in his throat and amps up the movements of the hand that\u2019s sweeping over the cook\u2019s back. As far as he\u2019s concerned, it\u2019s a poor comfort compared to the demons the other man is currently facing, but it\u2019s all he can do under the circumstances.</p>\n<p>For his part, Sanji doesn\u2019t seem to mind. In fact, his face softens and he relaxes further into the touch. \u201cYou\u2019re good at that,\u201d he murmurs, playing absently with the hairs on the back of Zoro\u2019s neck as he slumps against his chest. \u201cI never - this has been a real eye opening experience for me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Hopefully not <em> too </em>eye opening, Zoro thinks to himself, but makes no move to stop what he\u2019s doing.</p>\n<p>*****</p>\n<p>They leave Zou around mid-morning the next day. There are a number of tearful goodbyes and well wishes exchanged on either side, which Zoro finds kind of overwrought. The Minks are now part of the alliance that\u2019s due to take on Kaido, meaning a number of them will be heading for Wano in their own time.</p>\n<p>Pointing this out earns him an eye roll and a sharp elbow to the gut from Sanji, who\u2019s in the midst of his own farewells.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t mind him,\u201d he says to a bemused looking Pedro. \u201cIn case it\u2019s somehow escaped your notice over the past three days, he\u2019s a bit of an idiot.\u201d</p>\n<p>As usual, the jaguar Mink chuckles, but doesn\u2019t say anything further. He then nods as Sanji wanders off to say something to Carrot, before turning to Zoro and offering his hand. \u201cThis goes without saying, I\u2019m sure, but you\u2019ll keep an eye on him, won\u2019t you?\u201d</p>\n<p>Despite his very real position as a potential rival, Zoro can\u2019t help but like the Mink, so he takes the proffered hand without issue. \u201cObviously,\u201d he replies. \u201cProtecting the crew is my job, and that includes him.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat wasn\u2019t exactly what I meant, but I\u2019ll accept your answer in the spirit it was intended,\u201d Pedro says, blinking in the strange, lazy cat way of is. \u201cSee you in Wano, Roronoa.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYep,\u201d Zoro agrees, before moving to step into the structure that\u2019s once again been rigged up to transport all the Strawhats down to the <em> Sunny.</em></p>\n<p>Luffy had wanted to simply jump from Zunesha\u2019s back, but had been immediately overruled by an enraged combination of Nami and Sanji.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s the first one to set foot on the pulley system, but most of the others follow suit quickly. Nami\u2019s the last of them to climb onboard, busy exchanging numerous hugs goodbye with Wanda, but eventually she joins them, and Franky begins working the mechanism that\u2019ll lower them down to the sea.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure this is safe, right?\u201d Usopp asks, fidgeting nervously as the refurbished boat swings out over the launching pad. \u201cLike, there\u2019s no chance something\u2019s going to snap and send us plummeting into the ocean, is there?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGiven how high up we were, it\u2019s more likely that any plummeting we did would simply be to our deaths,\u201d Robin announces, earning herself a combination of exasperated noises and uneasy glances from the crew.</p>\n<p>\u201cGreat, thanks, Robin. That was exactly what I wanted to hear,\u201d Usopp says, now joined by an equally anxious looking Chopper. \u201cWould it kill you to go one day without predicting our gruesome demise?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt might?\u201d She replies with a tiny smile.</p>\n<p>\u201cUgh, Franky!\u201d Usopp groans. \u201cTell me this contraption isn\u2019t going to get us all killed.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBro, you literally already used it to load up the <em> Sunny </em>and to help patch up Zunesha,\u201d Franky says, sounding offended. \u201cPlus, you climbed up here the first time on the back of a deformed drawing of a lizard. Would you rather we tried that again instead?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMainly I\u2019d just rather we were back on the ground,\u201d Usopp says morosely.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Having settled himself in the depths of the boat already, Zoro curls his arms behind his head and sprawls out with little concern for how slow their descent is going. \u201cYou should try taking a nap,\u201d he suggests, already considering one of those for himself. \u201cIt\u2019ll make the time go by faster.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHow can you sleep knowing we might fall to our doom at any moment?\u201d Usopp asks.</p>\n<p>\u201cBecause he can sleep through anything,\u201d Sanji says, pulling a cigarette from his latest pack and flicking his lighter open. \u201cOr almost anything,\u201d he adds offhandedly, most of his attention now focused on igniting his smoke.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that supposed to mean?\u201d Chopper asks curiously, tilting his head to one side.</p>\n<p>\u201cHmm? Oh - um, nothing much,\u201d Sanji says, the bridge of his nose flaring slightly pink. \u201cJust more of a general comment, really.\u201d</p>\n<p>Zoro soon feels the weight of multiple eyes on him, so he closes his own in self-defence, figuring that if he can\u2019t see them, maybe for once in their lives his friends will leave well enough alone.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo, this seems like as good a time as any, bros,\u201d Franky pipes up, \u201cbut I should probably tell you I made you your own bedroom.\u201d</p>\n<p>*****</p>\n<p>The bedroom debacle carries them all the way down to the <em> Sunny</em>, and at one point nearly capsizes the lift when Luffy gets particularly energetic for not being given <em> his </em>own room.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cCap,\u201d Franky says tiredly, \u201cI <em> did </em> make you your own, remember? <em> Sunny </em> was built with private quarters for both the captain and first mate, it\u2019s just you and Zoro never <em> use </em>\u2018em.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, right,\u201d Luffy says, about to shove a contemplative finger up his nose and only stopping when Nami slaps his hand away. \u201cWell then why does Zoro get to have two?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t,\u201d Franky says patiently. \u201cI just revamped his old one so it\u2019s good to go.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Why</em>?\u201d Zoro asks sharply.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, you and Sanji have to keep up the act until Big Mom\u2019s been taken care of, right?\u201d The cyborg says, gesturing expansively. \u201cWhat if the ship gets boarded and someone gets suspicious?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSuspicious.\u201d Sanji repeats flatly. \u201cOf the lack of bedrooms.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, yeah. You don\u2019t think that\u2019s a risk we should be worried about?\u201d</p>\n<p>Sanji runs his temples, looking pained. \u201cWhen,\u201d he says through teeth that are now clenched tightly around his cigarette, \u201cwas the last time we got into a fight where the enemy examined our living quarters?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUmm, technically that would be during our fight with the Donquixote Pirates,\u201d Brook says. \u201cIf you recall, that Giolla woman made quite a mess in the men\u2019s bunkroom.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sanji makes a noise kind of like a distressed foghorn, while his face somehow gets impossibly redder. \u201cExcluding the ladies, I hate this crew,\u201d he says, turning on one heel and stomping off in the direction of the galley. \u201cNobody talk to me for at least another three hours!\u201d</p>\n<p>Everyone\u2019s silent until he vanishes out of sight and the familiar sound of the galley door slamming shut has stopped echoing across the deck. Only then, does Zoro crane his neck around and give Franky a dirty look.</p>\n<p>\u201cWas this really necessary?\u201d He asks, pretty sure his tone accurately conveys his own opinion on the matter.</p>\n<p>Unperturbed, Franky gives him an obnoxious thumbs up. \u201cJust trying to help you set the mood, Bro!\u201d He chirps. \u201cAlso, don\u2019t blame only me. Usopp helped by keeping you guys distracted while we were all down here the other day.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell him that!\u201d Usopp shrieks, ducking to try and hide behind the closest available crew member. Unfortunately for him, this happens to be Chopper. \u201cI don\u2019t want him murdering me in my sleep!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo one\u2019s murdering anyone, Usopp.\u201d Nami says tiredly. \u201cAlthough, if I was Zoro, I\u2019d kind of understand the urge.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, well, Zoro\u2019s being stupid about the whole thing,\u201d Usopp says with an unusual spark of bravery. \u201cWe all know how he feels about Sanji \u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWould you be <em> quiet</em>!\u201d Zoro hisses.</p>\n<p>\u201c \u2026 but he\u2019s been oblivious to the way Sanji\u2019s started looking at him.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Huh</em>?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI said what I said,\u201d Usopp replies, crossing his arms over his chest. \u201cAnd you can ask anyone else here, if you like. They\u2019ve all noticed the same thing.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>What </em>thing?\u201d Zoro demands, his head jerking from side to side as he tries to look at all of his crew mates at once. \u201cWhat the hell are you talking about, longnose?\u201d</p>\n<p>Usopp stares levelly back at him, his earlier terror now completely forgotten. \u201cSanji\u2019s, like, really comfortable with hanging off you, man. Way more than any of us would have expected when this whole mess started.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s been playing a <em> role,</em>\u201d Zoro says, unable to believe he needs to explain this. \u201cIt was all an act to save his skin. You don\u2019t see him clinging to me now that we\u2019re away from Zou, do you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, no,\u201d Usopp admits. \u201cBut we only left there like an hour ago. Plus, Sanji\u2019s kinda stupid where romance is concerned. He definitely thinks everything\u2019s been an act on your part.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd he\u2019d better keep right on thinking that,\u201d Zoro warns ominously. \u201cBecause anyone who makes him think otherwise is getting their ass kicked.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cStop threatening the crew, moron,\u201d Nami says with a sigh. \u201cAs much as it pains me to admit this, I do think Usopp might have a point where Sanji\u2019s concerned. He does seem to be looking at you in a new light.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh not you too,\u201d Zoro groans, unable to believe that the navigator of all people is switching sides on him like this. \u201cC\u2019mon, witch. You know full well he thinks I\u2019m a dirty, sweaty caveman with no manners and even less class.\u201d</p>\n<p>She snorts. \u201cThat\u2019s because you <em> are </em>a dirty, sweaty caveman with no manners and even less class,\u201d she says sweetly. \u201cBut you\u2019ve also spent the last four days and change showcasing a much softer side of yourself, and I think Sanji\u2019s noticed.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI repeat,\u201d Zoro says tiredly. \u201cHe thinks it\u2019s an act.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut it isn\u2019t,\u201d she points out. \u201cIt\u2019s just you giving in to every stupid urge you never figured he\u2019d let you get away with. Don\u2019t deny it,\u201d she adds when he opens his mouth to do exactly that. \u201cWe all know how you feel, Zoro. Even Luffy\u2019s fully in the loop for once.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cZoro loves Sanji,\u201d Luffy agrees with a firm nod. \u201cBut it\u2019s different from the way he loves the rest of us.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t love any of you,\u201d Zoro gripes. All this gets him is a bunch of eye rolls, however, and leaves him barely resisting the urge to tear his own hair out.</p>\n<p>\u201cI swear,\u201d he says then, \u201cif one of you so much as <em> breathes </em> a damn word of this to the cook, I\u2019m jumping ship and swimming back to Kuraigana. Even <em> Perona </em>was less annoying than you people.\u201d</p>\n<p>Nami makes a show of yawning exaggeratedly, while a number of the others unsuccessfully try to hide snickers behind their hands. Thoroughly done with this entire conversation, Zoro stalks past the entire group, intent on heading to the crow\u2019s nest and the privacy it provides.</p>\n<p>*****</p>\n<p>Despite his hope that things would at least be normal when it was just them and the crew on the <em> Sunny</em>, Zoro is sorely mistaken. They\u2019re several days into their journey to Wano - one that by Nami\u2019s estimation is going to take a few weeks, and that\u2019s providing the weather stays in their favour - but Sanji\u2019s still acting <em> weird</em>.</p>\n<p>And that\u2019s the best description Zoro can come up with - <em> weird</em>. It\u2019s not bad, or damning, or anything of that nature, it\u2019s just <em> weird</em>. He\u2019d been expecting the cook to at best fall back into their usual routine of antagonist rivals or at worst start acting genuinely nasty to make up for the two of them having to make nice in Zou. Instead, Sanji\u2019s acting almost as if they\u2019re still on Zou, and that\u2019s the most confusing possible outcome of all.</p>\n<p>Especially because, after a few days of careful observation, Zoro doesn\u2019t think the other man knows he\u2019s doing it. It\u2019s just that periodically Sanji will start to fall back into similar behaviour patterns to what he\u2019d had on Zou, only to usually catch himself at the last minute and wriggle away awkwardly.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s becoming harder to handle the longer it goes on for too. The number of times Sanji\u2019s casually leaned into his space or shot him a fond look over his shoulder or anything of that ilk have been increasing exponentially, and Zoro\u2019s traitorous heart is starting to wonder if maybe there isn\u2019t something to the rest of the crew\u2019s crackpot theory after all.</p>\n<p>Except, that\u2019s impossible, of course. Sanji\u2019s never shown even the slightest indication of a romantic inclination towards him, and there\u2019s no way seventy two hours worth of a fake relationship are going to change that. It\u2019s all in his head, and Zoro needs to get said head back on straight immediately.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Which! He would love to do, really, he would. It\u2019d just be extremely helpful if Sanji weren\u2019t suddenly around constantly. The <em> Sunny </em>may not be the biggest ship in the ocean, but she\u2019s still large enough that they shouldn\u2019t be running into each other wherever they go. He\u2019d almost think the cook was actively seeking him out, yet that can\u2019t possibly be right.</p>\n<p>Or, well, it\u2019s right in one instance, but that\u2019s an extenuating circumstance.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s the middle of a bright, clear afternoon. He\u2019s just finished up his training regimen for the next little while, and is settling in on the deck for a nap, when a familiar pair of long legs appear in his vision. Sanji pointedly taps the toe of one dress shoe, and then proceeds to dig it into Zoro\u2019s side when he refuses to acknowledge him.</p>\n<p>\u201cDamnit, Curls,\u201d Zoro says, swatting at him irritably. \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d</p>\n<p>Sanji\u2019s face screws up in that awkward way it does when he\u2019s after something specific, but doesn\u2019t actually want to ask for it. That usually means he\u2019s embarrassed by whatever it is, and is struggling to work up the nerve to just bite the bullet and say it.</p>\n<p>Zoro casts his gaze heavenward, looking for patience. \u201cCurls,\u201d he repeats. \u201cWhatever it is, spit it out so we can both get back to going about our days.\u201d</p>\n<p>His face heating, Sanji scuffs his foot along the deck. \u201cI,\u201d he says slowly, \u201cwas hoping you might be willing to help me with something. In the galley.\u201d</p>\n<p>That\u2019s odd enough that it\u2019d snag Zoro\u2019s attention even if he weren\u2019t already wrapped around the cook\u2019s little finger. As it stands, he guesses one could say he\u2019s double intrigued, and he cocks an eyebrow to indicate the other man should continue.</p>\n<p>\u201cNot here,\u201d Sanji says, easily parsing out his meaning. \u201cJust - come with me, would you?\u201d</p>\n<p>Ignoring the fact that he can see Usopp fishing off the side of the deck nearby, the sniper\u2019s head tilted to show he\u2019s clearly listening to them, Zoro nods. He then climbs laboriously to his feet, carefully tucking his swords back into the sash around his waist so he knows they\u2019re secure.</p>\n<p>Sanji doesn\u2019t say anything even once they\u2019re in the galley with the door shut securely behind them. Rather, he stands there with his hands shoved in his pockets, shifting from foot to foot like he expects Zoro to simply know why he\u2019s been summoned.</p>\n<p>Seeing as that\u2019s not a talent he possesses, Zoro pins the other man with a look. \u201cI\u2019m not a mind reader, Twirlybrows,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m willing to give you a hand with whatever\u2019s got your shorts in a knot, but you\u2019re gonna have to tell me what that <em> is.</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>Making a face like he\u2019s praying for patience, Sanji pulls his hands out of his pockets and starts wringing them together. \u201cUm,\u201d he says finally, but then refuses to add anything further.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Curls.</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI know, I know, sorry. It\u2019s just, ugh.\u201d Sanji groans, and scrubs his hands over his face. \u201cFuck, this is so embarrassing. Come with me. I\u2019ll show you what the problem is.\u201d</p>\n<p>With that said, he moves forward and ducks into the pantry, while Zoro obediently trots after him. Once inside, he flicks on the lights and points at a corner in the far end of the room. \u201cIt was over there the last time I saw it.\u201d</p>\n<p>About to ask what he\u2019s talking about, Zoro sees a flash of movement out of the corner of his good eye. Turning so he can get a better look at whatever it is, he isn\u2019t surprised when Sanji stiffens beside him as his gaze lands on a large bug that\u2019s merrily scuttling around the floor.</p>\n<p>\u201cCook - \u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t say it,\u201d Sanji snaps. \u201cI know it\u2019s stupid, but - but you get it now, and you said none of what happened was anything to be ashamed of, so I\u2019m kind of hoping you were serious about that and that you won\u2019t mock me until the day I die for this.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSanji - \u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNope,\u201d he insists. \u201cNo real names, you know it weirds me out when you do that. Just - fucking get rid of it, will you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSure,\u201d Zoro says, already unhooking his swords from his belt and shifting so he can leave them outside the pantry door. \u201cWas it only the one, or did you see any others?\u201d</p>\n<p>Sanji shudders. \u201cI only saw the one,\u201d he hedges.</p>\n<p>\u201cBut it likely came in from Zou, which means there could be plenty,\u201d Zoro surmises.</p>\n<p>\u201cUgh, don\u2019t put it like that,\u201d Sanji groans. \u201cThere could be, you\u2019re right, but I really fucking hope not.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cS\u2019fine, I\u2019ll be thorough,\u201d Zoro says. His swords safely secured, he unwraps the sash from around his waist, and then starts undoing the buttons on his over robe.</p>\n<p>\u201cUm,\u201d Sanji says, his voice slightly higher than normal. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cRobe\u2019s too loose and baggy for something like this,\u201d Zoro says, bundling the whole mess up and tossing it out of the room where it lands neatly on one of the dining room chairs. \u201cI don\u2019t want anything crawling inside it while I\u2019m rooting around in here.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUrk, don\u2019t make me sick,\u201d Sanji mutters, looking a little wild around the eyes. \u201cWhat if something lands on you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThen it\u2019ll be easier for me to see and kill,\u201d Zoro says, unconcerned. \u201cThey don\u2019t bother me the way they do you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cRight, fine.\u201d Sanji mutters, no longer meeting Zoro\u2019s eye. \u201cDo your thing, Marimo, and there might even be some booze in it for you if I\u2019m feeling generous.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWorks for me,\u201d Zoro tells him, vanishing back into the pantry.</p>\n<p>He re-emerges a while later, still shirtless, but reasonably certain he\u2019s gotten any creepy crawlies that might have made their way into Sanji\u2019s sanctuary.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cWas it bad?\u201d The cook asks when he spots him, and Zoro shakes his head.</p>\n<p>\u201cNah,\u201d he says, wiping his hands on a dish rag Sanji throws his way, and then reaching for his robe. \u201cFound two others besides the one you stumbled over, but I don\u2019t think they were even the same kind. I don\u2019t think you need to be worried about an infestation.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThank fuck,\u201d Sanji says, his shoulders sagging in relief. \u201cI know it\u2019s never been a secret, but I <em> really </em>hate bugs. Also, here,\u201d rummaging around beneath the counter, he pulls a bottle of sake free and offers it up. \u201cThat\u2019s yours, as promised.\u201d</p>\n<p>Zoro stares at the bottle for a moment, letting his gaze flit back and forth between it and Sanji\u2019s face a few times before he takes it. \u201cI\u2019d\u2019ve done it regardless,\u201d he says, not sure if he should be admitting to this or not, \u201cbut thanks.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sanji\u2019s cheeks turn pink, and he looks at the ground. \u201cWhatever,\u201d he mumbles. \u201cDon\u2019t go getting all mushy on me, Mossball.\u201d</p>\n<p>Zoro wouldn\u2019t exactly call what he\u2019d said \u2018mushy\u2019, but Sanji\u2019s shoulders are steadily crawling towards his shoulders in an awkward hunch, and even he\u2019s capable of reading the room under these circumstances. Saluting the other man with his bottle, he nods and heads back to the main deck.</p>\n<p>*****</p>\n<p>They continue sailing, getting closer and closer to Wano, and a level of anticipation settles over the ship, causing tension to ratchet up in a way that only happens when they\u2019re heading into a big fight. Zoro can feel it in the air, and he doubts he\u2019s the only one.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tension can affect different people in different ways, however. Especially people who\u2019ve recently been through one traumatic event already. Sanji can say what he likes, but it\u2019s clear he\u2019s still feeling the strain of having his past brought up without his consent.</p>\n<p>This becomes all the more obvious when he jerks awake in his bunk one night, not quite able to contain the upset cry that spills from his lips. He manages to muffle it before he wakes anybody else, but Zoro\u2019s been having a restless sleep of his own, so he\u2019s already up.</p>\n<p>Sanji doesn\u2019t realize this. Or, if he does, he pretends to not have any knowledge of it. Instead, he sits slumped in his bunk until he\u2019s got his breathing mostly under control, only to then roll out of bed and leave the room entirely.</p>\n<p>Zoro watches him go, noting the way the door closes behind him with a soft click. It\u2019s possible he\u2019s just going to the bathroom, maybe feeling the need to splash some cold water on his face, but the longer he\u2019s gone, the more the swordsman suspects he has no intention of coming back,</p>\n<p>He lies in his own bunk for a while, the <em> Sunny </em>swaying gently beneath him, and considers his options. Only a handful of weeks ago, he\u2019d have left well enough alone, certain his presence wouldn\u2019t be welcome. Now, though, it\u2019s harder to convince himself that this is the case.</p>\n<p>Groaning, he kicks his way free of his bed covers, knowing there\u2019s no chance he\u2019s getting back to sleep tonight until he\u2019s checked on the cook. Hoping this won\u2019t get him kicked from one end of the <em> Sunny </em>to the other, he takes a deep breath and marches resolutely towards the galley, certain that\u2019s where Sanji will have headed.</p>\n<p>Soft light shining out through the porthole window is enough to confirm his suspicions, and he eases the door open, expecting to find the cook either poking at something on the stove, or at least scribbling in one of his recipe books.\u00a0</p>\n<p>On this, he turns out to be mistaken. Painting a picture that makes Zoro\u2019s chest clench, Sanji\u2019s sitting slumped at the dining room table with his head buried in his hands. His shoulders are noticeably shaking, and when he listens carefully Zoro hears the same almost-whimper Sanji\u2019d made that night on Zou.</p>\n<p>He\u2019d definitely made the right decision by coming in here then. Even if all he ends up doing is providing Sanji with a target for some misplaced aggression, that alone will be worth it for the distraction it\u2019d offer up.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou alright there, Curls?\u201d He asks, even though the answer is as clear as day.</p>\n<p>Sanji\u2019s head jerks up, allowing Zoro an unencumbered look at his face. His eyes are bright, although not wet, and he\u2019s sucking in heavy lungfuls of air the same way he had the last time Zoro\u2019d seen him like this.</p>\n<p>\u201cMarimo,\u201d he says, dashing a hand across his face in what\u2019s likely a move to reassure himself that no tears have been shed. \u201cWhat are you doing in here at this hour? If it\u2019s a snack you\u2019re after, you\u2019re going to have to give me a minute.\u201d</p>\n<p>Zoro rolls his eye at the show of bravado. \u201cYou know that\u2019s not why I\u2019m in here, dumbass. I heard you get up and came to check on you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGotta make sure I\u2019m not totally losing it, huh?\u201d Sanji asks, letting out a laugh that holds no humour whatsoever. \u201cCan\u2019t say I blame you, really. It\u2019s your job to watch out for potential liabilities.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t put words in my mouth, asshole,\u201d Zoro says, using just enough edge in his voice to keep Sanji from thinking he\u2019s pampering him. \u201cI\u2019m not worried about you fucking over the crew, I\u2019m only worried about you period.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh <em> hell</em>, Zoro, you can\u2019t just say shit like that,\u201d Sanji says, rubbing a hand over his face again. \u201cI\u2019m not exactly equipped to handle your pity right now.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not pity,\u201d Zoro insists, earning himself a weak grin from Sanji.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, I know,\u201d he says tiredly. \u201cAlthough I don\u2019t know if that makes it better or worse.\u201d Standing abruptly, he moves like he\u2019s going to head for the pantry, but his gait is unsteady, lacking his usual grace and speaking of a bone deep exhaustion that shouldn\u2019t be there.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t the first night you\u2019ve had trouble sleeping, is it?\u201d Zoro asks, watching him with narrowed eyes as he bumps into the corner of the table.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNot exactly.\u201d Sanji replies, and the fact that he\u2019s willing to admit even that much is as damning as any condemnation Zoro\u2019s ever heard. \u201cIt\u2019s possible that Judge is in my head a bit more than I\u2019d care to say.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMmm.\u201d Zoro half watches him for a little longer, but most of his attention is elsewhere, snagged by an idea that\u2019s now weaseled its way into his brain. \u201cAre you planning to go back to the bunkroom tonight?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI am not,\u201d Sanji declares. \u201cI have a sneaking suspicion that my head is going to betray me again if I go back to sleep, and there\u2019s no way I\u2019m risking waking everyone else up with that. If worse comes to worse, I\u2019ll sleep in here on the couch.\u201d</p>\n<p>Zoro spares said couch a glance. He\u2019s napped on it plenty since the <em> Sunny </em>had come into their lives, but it was hardly preferable to a real bed. His mind therefore made up, he steps forward to intercept Sanji before he gets too far away.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou need a proper rest,\u201d he says, stopping Sanji with a hand on his arm. \u201cOr,\u201d he adds, well aware that it\u2019s already an absurd hour in the morning, \u201cas close to one as you can get.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUnfortunately, I suspect that ship has sailed for the night,\u201d Sanji says, shaking him off. \u201cIt\u2019s fine, Marimo. I\u2019ve got it handled.\u201d</p>\n<p>Undeterred, Zoro shakes his head and steps further into the other man\u2019s personal space. \u201cIf you\u2019re not willing to go to bed, I\u2019ll put you there myself.\u201d</p>\n<p>His eyes narrowing dangerously, Sanji shifts to swing a leg around, his intention plain. Zoro\u2019s expecting it, however, and leans into the movement, rather than away from it. Hunching forward, this allows him to get under the cook and hike him up onto his shoulder.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat the fuck?\u201d Sanji yells, and Zoro hushes him with a sharp smack to his hip.</p>\n<p>\u201cIf you start shrieking, you\u2019re gonna wake everybody else up,\u201d he scolds. \u201cSo unless you want to have to explain what\u2019s going on here, I suggest you shut your trap.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShut my -?!\u201d Sanji snarls, his hands clawing at Zoro\u2019s shoulders. \u201cOooh, Mossball, I really am going to kill you this time. Put me the hell down.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo.\u201d Zoro says simply, already marching to the galley door. \u201cAnd if you don\u2019t quit squirming, I\u2019ll start yelling until someone comes looking.\u201d</p>\n<p>It\u2019s a bluff, there\u2019s no way he\u2019d do that to Sanji under the circumstances, but luckily not one the cook seems willing to call him on. Letting out a disgruntled sigh, he falls silent and contents himself with fisting a hand in Zoro\u2019s hair and giving it a vicious yank.</p>\n<p>Since that\u2019s basically the equivalent of Sanji waving a white flag, Zoro allows himself a small grin and nudges the galley door open with his foot before striding out onto the deck with his precious burden in tow. He then steps carefully down the stairs and walks across the lawn in the opposite direction of the men\u2019s bunkroom.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh wow,\u201d Sanji says, his voice dripping with condescension. \u201cIt\u2019s finally happened. You\u2019ve gotten lost on your own ship.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t get lost,\u201d Zoro sniffs. \u201cAnd I\u2019m definitely not lost now.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd yet I can see the bunkroom door getting further and further away.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSure, but <em> I </em>can see the one we need getting closer and closer,\u201d Zoro replies. Ducking under the awning he\u2019s just reached, he drops down into the short hallway and grabs for the doorknob of the room he\u2019s after. Flicking on the light as he passes, he doesn\u2019t stop until he reaches the large double bed and can dump Sanji down on top of it.</p>\n<p>The blond stares up at him from where he\u2019s sprawled across the mattress, while simultaneously trying to fix his sleep shirt, which has gotten rucked up over his stomach during the trek down. \u201cWhat,\u201d he says, practically spitting the word, \u201cam I doing in here?\u201d</p>\n<p>Zoro takes a moment to glance around and take a look at where \u2018here\u2019 is. He can\u2019t remember the last time he\u2019d set foot in the bedroom that technically belongs to him, but he\u2019s pretty sure Franky\u2019s made some upgrades while cleaning it out during their stay on Zou. He definitely doesn\u2019t remember the bed being quite so nice for one.</p>\n<p>The sound of Sanji clearing his throat gets his attention back on the cook, and he tries not to let the other man\u2019s irritated expression get his own back up. \u201cYou need to sleep,\u201d he says cautiously. \u201cI get why you don\u2019t want to do it in the bunkroom right now, but a couch in your kitchen isn\u2019t going to cut it either. So,\u201d he flaps a hand awkwardly at the bed. \u201cUse this.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sanji peers up at him through a tousled fringe of hair, for once both of his eyes at least partly on display. \u201cWhere I sleep,\u201d he says, giving Zoro a look that clearly implies he thinks he\u2019s an idiot, \u201cisn\u2019t the problem. I\u2019m going to have nightmares wherever I am.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d Zoro shrugs. \u201cBut you can still sleep somewhere more comfortable than the kitchen.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh sure,\u201d Sanji scoffs, \u201cbecause an unfamiliar environment is going to be <em> so </em> much better.\u201d</p>\n<p>Zoro frowns. \u201cWe\u2019re on the <em> Sunny</em>,\u201d he says, failing to see how that\u2019s an unfamiliar environment even if the room\u2019s had a recent makeover. \u201cAnd you slept fine on Zou, minus that one night.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, <em> yeah</em>, but that was because I wasn\u2019t alone,\u201d Sanji snaps. His eyes widen almost immediately after as he realizes what he\u2019s just said, and he looks like he\u2019s about two seconds away from slapping a hand over his mouth while Zoro gawks at him.</p>\n<p>\u201cUh, well. I mean, I could - stay?\u201d Zoro offers before he can think better of it. He mentally slaps himself upside the head a few times for thinking this might ever be a reasonable suggestion, but rather than look murderous, Sanji now looks almost \u2026 hopeful.</p>\n<p>\u201cReally?\u201d He asks, suddenly fascinated with the comforter he\u2019s sitting on top of. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to, obviously, but it - uh - I don\u2019t know. It might help.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt was my idea,\u201d Zoro reminds him, his mouth continuing to run away without his permission. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have suggested it if I minded. Besides, this room may as well get some use since Franky went through all the trouble of putting it together.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cRight,\u201d Sanji agrees, nodding his head slowly. \u201cThat makes sense.\u201d</p>\n<p><em> Nothing </em>about this makes sense, and they both know it. Still, if it makes Sanji feel better - and gets him to get some frigging sleep - Zoro supposes he can sacrifice what\u2019s left of his sanity for the greater good. His mind thus made up, he closes the bedroom door behind him and moves towards the bed.</p>\n<p>They each automatically gravitate to the sides they\u2019d claimed as their own in Zou. Sanji folds back the covers while Zoro gets the light, and they both end up lying there in awkward silence.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou know,\u201d Zoro says, wincing in the dark as a reasonable thought hits him far, far too late. \u201cIf it\u2019s mainly company you\u2019re after, I could just sleep on the floor.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe already had that argument in Zou,\u201d Sanji reminds him. \u201cYou lost.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut - \u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShut up, Marimo. You started this, but I\u2019m finishing it. Now, be quiet so we can both get some sleep.\u201d</p>\n<p>With that said, Sanji rolls over onto his side, facing away from Zoro and effectively ending the conversation.</p>\n<p>\u201cRight,\u201d Zoro says stiltedly. \u201cUh, goodnight?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTechnically, it\u2019s morning already, but yeah. Same to you.\u201d</p>\n<p>*****</p>\n<p>Zoro\u2019s napping near <em> Sunny</em>\u2019s stern when a shadow falls over him and then leans down to grab him by the ear.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat the hell?!\u201d He yelps, flailing both his arms and legs outward until he realizes it\u2019s Nami who\u2019s got him in her clutches. \u201cDamnit, Witch,\u201d he groans, trying and failing to twist his head away from her. \u201cWhat\u2019d I do now?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m almost afraid to ask,\u201d she growls, shaking him none too gently as she glares at him. \u201cFranky and Usopp were gossiping like a pair of useless old biddies this morning. They seem to think that stupid bedroom they made you got used last night.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo? That\u2019s what it\u2019s there for, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p>\n<p>Zoro realizes too late that he should have tried to pretend he has no idea what she\u2019s talking about. Nami\u2019s eyes narrow into furious slits, and her hold on his ear tightens to the point that he\u2019s starting to worry he might lose it.</p>\n<p>\u201cSanji,\u201d she says in a voice that\u2019s ice cold, \u201cis <em> very </em>vulnerable right now, and while I don\u2019t think you\u2019d ever do anything to take advantage of that on purpose, I can\u2019t help worrying that you might do it by accident.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI didn\u2019t do jack shit,\u201d Zoro retorts. \u201cBut I\u2019m not telling you what happened, either,\u201d he adds when she opens her mouth to say something further. \u201cYou know how private he is. He\u2019d hate the very idea of this conversation.\u201d</p>\n<p>Nami purses her lips thoughtfully and finally lets go of his ear. While he rubs at it theatrically, she makes a contemplative noise and rests her hands on her hips. \u201cYou\u2019re not entirely useless at this, are you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cEh? What are you talking about?\u201d Zoro asks.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis,\u201d she repeats, flapping a hand to illustrate any number of possible things. \u201cRomantic relationships. You\u2019re actually decent at them, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDunno,\u201d Zoro replies. \u201cNever really been in one.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Rather than look surprised by this like he\u2019s half expecting, Nami\u2019s thoughtful expression deepens. \u201cYeah, that tracks now that I think about it,\u201d she says. \u201cYou\u2019re not the kind of guy to slip in and out of relationships without a strong connection.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c \u2026 sure,\u201d Zoro decides, willing to say whatever it takes to get this conversation over with.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s apparently too flippant because Nami\u2019s eyes start to narrow dangerously again. Opening her mouth to no doubt tear another strip off of him, she\u2019s interrupted when the loudspeaker that\u2019s hooked up to the crow\u2019s nest crackles to life.</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t mean to alarm anyone,\u201d Robin says calmly, \u201cbut I\u2019ve just spotted a ship, and it\u2019s approaching us at speed.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe hell?\u201d Zoro says, craning his neck around to try and see what she\u2019s getting at. \u201cD\u2019you think it\u2019s someone from Wano?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWano doesn\u2019t have ships that sail outside of its borders, and we\u2019re still days away from there,\u201d Nami replies. \u201cAnd if it\u2019s a ship, not a submarine, that rules the Heart Pirates out too.\u201d</p>\n<p>Most of the crew are heading towards the main deck, so he and Nami do the same. Zoro comes to a stop right beside Sanji\u2019s elbow - the cook having been enjoying a quick smoke at the railing, it looks like - but both their attention on Usopp, who\u2019s got his spyglass out to watch the oncoming vessel.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat the hell?\u201d The sniper says. \u201cThere\u2019s something out there, alright, but it\u2019s not like any ship I\u2019ve ever seen. It looks like a giant transponder snail.\u201d</p>\n<p>Zoro feels Sanji stiffen next to him. \u201cUsopp,\u201d the cook says grimly. \u201cPass me that scope, will you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUh, okay?\u201d Not bothering to come any closer, Usopp tosses the spyglass across the distance.</p>\n<p>Sanji catches it easily and raises it to eye level. \u201c<em>Shit,</em>\u201d he hisses. \u201cMotherfucking goddamnit all to hell!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCook?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThey\u2019re enemies,\u201d Sanji says, dropping the spyglass and chucking it back in Usopp\u2019s direction without bothering to look at what he\u2019s doing. \u201cIt\u2019s fucking <em> Germa.</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>The deck goes silent, with nobody daring to say a word until Sanji lets out a mirthless chuckle. \u201cNone of you are going to ask me if I\u2019m sure?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI figure we can all trust you on this one, Curls.\u201d Zoro says. \u201cWhat do you think they want?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d Luffy snaps, punching one fist into the open palm of his other hand. \u201cThey were mean to Sanji, so we\u2019re going to kick their asses!\u201d</p>\n<p>That\u2019s the kind of plan Zoro can get behind, and judging by the expressions of the rest of the crew, he\u2019s hardly the only one. Even Sanji, who would never want anyone risking themselves for him, looks more resigned than anything else.</p>\n<p>\u201cThey\u2019re dangerous,\u201d he points out halfheartedly. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen any of my siblings in years, but if some or all of them are over there, they\u2019re basically emotionless killing machines.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ve dealt with a few of those before,\u201d Franky muses thoughtfully. \u201cThey\u2019re not gonna know what hit \u2018em.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFine,\u201d Sanji says, his own expression that of a man who knows better than to argue. \u201cBut if any of you get yourselves killed, I\u2019m going to be seriously pissed off.\u201d</p>\n<p>Zoro snorts. \u201cI already told you,\u201d he says, thumbing Wado\u2019s hilt in anticipation. \u201cIf we end up fighting them, they\u2019re the only ones who\u2019re going to get killed.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sanji purses his lips, but doesn\u2019t say anything further. Instead, he pulls a fresh cigarette from the pack in his pocket, lighting with quick efficiency and taking a heavy drag. \u201cThe snail ships are fast, it won\u2019t take them long to catch us if we don\u2019t try to avoid it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Part of Zoro wants to rest a comforting hand on his shoulder because who knows how hard this has to be for him. Zoro\u2019s bright enough to read the room, however, and he can tell that the last thing Sanji needs is for someone to mess with him right now - unintentional though it might be.</p>\n<p>No one says anything as the strange ship comes nearer. As Sanji had said, it\u2019s moving remarkably fast, meaning it\u2019s not long before they can all make out its form unaided. Exactly as Usopp had noted, it looks like a giant transponder snail with a castle on its back.</p>\n<p>\u201cFuck,\u201d Sanji says simply. His cigarette is mostly gone now, and he flicks the butt over the railing without taking his eyes off the vessel. \u201cThat\u2019s the flagship.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d Someone asks, and Sanji rolls his eyes.</p>\n<p>\u201cI was <em> born </em>on it,\u201d he grunts. \u201cIt\u2019s not a place I\u2019m likely to forget.\u201d</p>\n<p>His statement makes Zoro take a closer look at the ship, and he wrinkles his nose, not liking what he sees. At a glance it\u2019s a dreary, imposing thing, not at all like the kind of atmosphere he\u2019d expect the cook to flourish in. Even Mihawk\u2019s castle was more inviting.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s as he\u2019s eyeing up the structure that he starts to see movement on the battlements. A number of similar looking people in white at black uniforms are crawling all over the place, but as he watches, a set of heavy metal doors open and a massive figure with a mane of dirty blond hair comes into view.</p>\n<p>Sanji sucks in a heavy breath, and then to Zoro\u2019s shock, reaches out and clamps a hand around his wrist.</p>\n<p>\u201cCook?\u201d Zoro says warily. \u201cYou know him?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou could say that.\u201d Sanji murmurs, flashing Zoro a bright smile that doesn\u2019t reach his eyes. \u201cThat would be your father-in-law, dear.\u201d</p>\n<p>Zoro takes a minute to digest this, and also grabs a better look at Vinsmoke Judge while he\u2019s at it. After several seconds of quiet contemplation, he decides he\u2019s not impressed.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou must take after your mother,\u201d he says then. \u201cHe\u2019s got a face like a boar\u2019s ass.\u201d</p>\n<p>A number of the crew laugh, Sanji the loudest among them, and much to Zoro\u2019s relief the sound seems to be a genuine one. Dashing the hand not still clutching Zoro\u2019s arm over his face, the cook chuckles wetly. \u201cHe does, doesn\u2019t he?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMhm, and it\u2019s going to look even worse once we\u2019re done with him.\u201d</p>\n<p>Any response Sanji might make to this is headed off at the pass by the Germa ship now getting within boarding distance. From his place on the battlements, Judge fixes the <em> Sunny </em>with a haughty glare and shouts across the distance.</p>\n<p>\u201cStrawhat! I believe you have something that belongs to me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Luffy blinks up at the monarch and casually adjusts his hat on his head. \u201cNah, I don\u2019t think so,\u201d he says.</p>\n<p>Judge frowns, taken aback by the easy dismissal. Gathering his bearings, he points an imperious hand at Sanji. \u201cThat failure has Vinsmoke blood in his veins and finally a way he can be of use to me. I\u2019m taking him back whether you like it or not.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, it\u2019s a still a no,\u201d Luffy replies. \u201cSanji\u2019s my cook, and I don\u2019t want anybody else.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe matter isn\u2019t up for debate,\u201d Judge snaps, slamming a heavy fist down on the railing in front of him. \u201cI didn\u2019t come here to ask for your permission. I came to take what I need, by force if necessary.\u201d</p>\n<p>Luffy shrugs. \u201cYou can try, but I doubt you\u2019re strong enough.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh for fuck\u2019s sake,\u201d Sanji says exasperatedly. \u201cLuffy, stop pissing him off.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe started it!\u201d Luffy protests. \u201cWhat makes him think he can just come in here and make you go with him?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDecades of never having been told no for a start,\u201d Sanji replies, his voice desert dry. \u201cKings are used to getting what they want.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell then I think he should learn a new lesson,\u201d Luffy declares, crossing his arms over his chest. \u201cOi! Did you hear that, armour guy? You can\u2019t have Sanji, and we\u2019ll fight anybody you send over to try and take him.\u201d</p>\n<p>Judge\u2019s eyes narrow furiously, his entire face a picture of outrage. \u201cI was prepared to content myself with reclaiming the failure and getting the swordsman out of the way, but now I think I\u2019ll kill your entire crew.\u201d</p>\n<p>Luffy turns away from Judge, apparently done with the conversation. \u201cI get what he means with Sanji, but what did Zoro do to him?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt seems that the news of Zoro and Sanji\u2019s fabled romance has reached him and he\u2019s bought the charade,\u201d Brooks says thoughtfully. \u201cAnd I suppose since the story created was that they\u2019re married as opposed to simply a couple, Zoro\u2019s a threat to the wedding he\u2019s trying to stage.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDeath is a quicker and more finite solution than divorce,\u201d Robin agrees. \u201cHis logic is sound.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGee, thanks.\u201d Zoro says dryly.</p>\n<p>Sanji kicks him in the shin, albeit gently. \u201cDon\u2019t be rude to Robin,\u201d he scolds, \u201cbut,\u201d he adds, his face softening. \u201cI am sorry for getting you into this mess.\u201d</p>\n<p>Zoro considers trying to reassure him, but in the end decides it isn\u2019t necessary. What <em> is </em>necessary, however, is dealing with Germa once and for all. \u201cThey can do their worst,\u201d he says, moving to draw Shusui and Kitetsu free from their sheaths. \u201cI\u2019m not worried.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe don\u2019t know what\u2019s over there,\u201d Nami says cautiously. \u201cSanji, can you tell us what to expect?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell armed, well trained soldiers, and a lot of them at that,\u201d Sanji replies. \u201cBut as for anything more specific, I\u2019m afraid it\u2019s been a long time since I set foot on one of those ships. Your guess is as good as mine.\u201d</p>\n<p>As if on cue, the castle\u2019s main gates open as soon as these words leave his mouth, and dozens of heavily armed soldiers pour out through the doors. Even worse, above them, four beams of brightly coloured light shoot out, streaming directly towards the <em> Sunny </em>.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat the hell are those?!\u201d Usopp shrieks, flailing backwards as he grabs for his slingshot.</p>\n<p>Sanji swallows thickly, his gaze locked on the lights. \u201cI think they\u2019re my siblings.\u201d</p>\n<p>Surprised noises echo around the deck, but before anyone can find their voices, the lights solidify into humanoid shapes, and the next thing anybody knows, three tall men and a woman, all with the same distinctive curled eyebrows, land on the ship.</p>\n<p>\u201cFuck.\u201d Sanji says simply. Much like the rest of the crew, he\u2019s whirled around to stare at the threat that\u2019s just landed in their midst, but his expression is as pinched as Zoro\u2019s ever seen it.</p>\n<p>To try and shake him free of his stupor, Zoro nudges him with a shoulder. \u201cReiju\u2019s easy enough, but which of the guys is which?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIf you look at the suits you can see the numbers,\u201d Sanji mutters through gritted teeth. \u201cBut if you really want it spelled out for you; red and haughty is Ichiji, blue and mean is Niji, and green and dumb is Yonji.\u201d</p>\n<p>Zoro considers this, a previous throwaway comment by the cook now ringing in his ears. \u201cHey, Luffy!\u201d He calls, raising his swords with intent. \u201cI want the blue one.\u201d</p>\n<p>None of the Vinsmokes react beyond a slight twisting of the corner of Reiju\u2019s mouth, which Zoro has no desire to read anything into. All four of them eye the Strawhats like they\u2019ve just rolled in something disgusting, their disdain obvious.</p>\n<p>Not a soul moves on the ship for a second, until Judge raises a hand ever so slightly. \u201cGrab Sanji and kill the rest,\u201d he says.</p>\n<p>His hand drops down and not only do his children charge forward, but a number of the soldiers begin making their way over to the <em> Sunny.\u00a0</em>It\u2019s not long before the entire deck is teeming with enemies, Germa\u2019s manpower seeming to be never ending.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s clear from the way they fight that this is not an army who\u2019s used to being challenged in battle. Plenty of soldiers go down before they even reach the ship, taken out by Luffy\u2019s fists and a couple well placed thunderbolts from Nami. Those that come after are slightly more cautious, but still move with an arrogance that shows they think this fight is a foregone conclusion.</p>\n<p>This is hardly the first time an enemy\u2019s come in so supremely confident that they can take the Strawhats, but it\u2019s still been a while. Their reputation has preceded them in the New World, and people tend to react accordingly.</p>\n<p>Zoro wonders, almost idly, if that\u2019s because Judge is really that arrogant, or if it\u2019s because of something more sinister - namely the experiments he\u2019s performed on his children and subjects alike. In the end, he supposes it doesn\u2019t matter, but it\u2019s what\u2019s on his mind as he rushes forward to meet his opponent.</p>\n<p>Niji allows him to close in, raising his arms protectively as Zoro swings both swords down towards his face. Zoro thinks he sees the faint edge of a smirk when they meet, the two of them trading a series of blows back and forth as they each get a feel for the other\u2019s prowess.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s strong, that much is readily apparent, and a quick glance around shows that the rest of the Vinsmoke are equally powerful. Even with that, though, a few minutes of skirmishing back and forth makes Zoro relatively confident they\u2019re not strong enough.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou spend a lot of time picking on people weaker than you, don\u2019t you?\u201d He says, blocking a heavy blow with Shusui.</p>\n<p>Niji frowns and rears back to hit him again, this time using both fists. \u201cWhat\u2019s that supposed to mean?\u201d</p>\n<p>Zoro grimaces. It\u2019s bad enough the man\u2019s face is similar to Sanji\u2019s, but their voices are fairly close as well. It\u2019s like looking at a distorted mirror.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Shaking his head, he reminds himself that the tone and emotion are all wrong, and lashes out with a series of swipes that manage to do some damage to Niji\u2019s armour.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I mean,\u201d he says, gesturing at the way the other man recoils even though he\u2019s not hurt. \u201cYou\u2019re not used to fighting someone who\u2019s on your level. Let alone above it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Niji\u2019s frown morphs into a full on scowl, and this time he comes at Zoro with less finesse than he had previously - a clear indication that the swordsman had struck a nerve. \u201cYou\u2019re not even close to my level, you peon,\u201d he snarls. \u201cIf you were, you wouldn\u2019t have settled for my useless brother.\u201d</p>\n<p>Zoro snorts, sidestepping him easily and spinning on his heel to face him as he comes around again. \u201cAs far as I\u2019m concerned, he\u2019s the only one of you worth wasting my time on.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re delusional.\u201d Niji spits, and this time when he charges, it\u2019s actively sloppy. Zoro blocks him with Shusui alone, and then lands a slash across his chest with Kitetsu that sends him stumbling backwards.</p>\n<p>\u201cHow dare you even <em> touch </em> me,\u201d Niji hisses. Zoro\u2019s sword hadn\u2019t just hit the armour this time, there\u2019s a wound that\u2019s actively seeping blood, although he doubts it\u2019s a fatal one.</p>\n<p>Now clearly furious, Niji moves like he\u2019s going to attack once more, only to shout in surprise when one of Usopp\u2019s pop greens bursts at his feet, its long vines shooting upwards to wrap around his arms and legs.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou think this is enough to stop me?\u201d He demands, his muscles bunching as he struggles to free himself.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cPerhaps not,\u201d another voice says, \u201cbut I\u2019m more than happy to share the load.\u201d</p>\n<p>With Robin having said her piece, a number of arms sprout around him, securing the struggling prince in place. One hand even goes so far as to land a stinging slap on his cheek, something Zoro can\u2019t help but think is intentional.</p>\n<p>Willing to consider that threat neutralized for now, Zoro looks around for a new enemy to fight and finds one almost immediately. His own eyes narrowed in distaste, Yonji throws a wild punch at him, this blow even heavier than that of his brother\u2019s.</p>\n<p>Zoro vaguely remembers Sanji commenting about how Yonji was the biggest of the quadruplets despite being the last born. It looks like that\u2019s corresponded to a higher level of physical strength as well, albeit with fewer precision skills based on the way his movements are much less fluid.</p>\n<p>Which isn\u2019t to say this brother doesn\u2019t have his own tricks up his sleeve, literally, as it turns out. Zoro\u2019s resigned himself to their fight turning into an all out brawl when Yonji\u2019s fists suddenly shoot forward on strange, chain like contraptions, his hands and wrists no longer attached to the rest of his body.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat the hell?!\u201d Nami shrieks, clutching her climatact baton as one arm narrowly misses her. \u201cThat\u2019s so gross!\u201d</p>\n<p>Gross isn\u2019t exactly the word Zoro would use, but it\u2019ll do in a pinch. Twisting to avoid both coiled limbs as they zero in on him, he bats them both away, while at the same time testing their durability with his swords.</p>\n<p>\u201cWere you expecting me to be impressed?\u201d He asks as Yonji retracts his arms until they\u2019ve snapped back into a normal position.</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t care if you\u2019re impressed or not,\u201d the youngest Vinsmoke says, cracking his neck from side to side. \u201cAnd the only thing I expect is for you to die.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIs that any way to speak to your brother-in-law?\u201d Brook demands, arriving on the scene with his own sword drawn. \u201cWhat terrible manners you young men have.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI doubt they\u2019re worried about offending me,\u201d Zoro mutters, using the lull in the fight to take stock of the rest of the crew.</p>\n<p>Robin\u2019s taken on sole responsibility for keeping Niji under control, while Usopp\u2019s moved on to helping Nami and Franky fight off the main waves of Germa soldiers. Chopper is surprisingly holding his own against the sister, while Luffy is gleefully pummeling Ichiji, who looks surprised to find himself on the losing end of a battle.</p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t see Sanji anywhere.</p>\n<p>\u201cBrook,\u201d he starts, only for the skeleton to cut him off.</p>\n<p>\u201cI know,\u201d he says, stepping in front of Zoro with his sword held aloft. \u201cHe\u2019s boarded the Germa flagship to deal with Judge himself. I figured you\u2019d want to join him. I\u2019ll take care of this pup.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThanks,\u201d Zoro says, ignoring Yonji\u2019s resulting sputtering. \u201cTruth be told, I don\u2019t think he\u2019s any tougher than the others.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDuly noted,\u201d Brook replies. \u201cNow, please go reclaim our dear cook.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOn it.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>Without bothering to sheathe his swords, Zoro darts across the <em> Sunny</em>, ploughing his way through any Germa fighters who get in his way, and then leaps the distance to the flagship. He\u2019s met with more soldiers there, but quickly dispatches them.</p>\n<p>\u201cOi, Curls!\u201d He barks, looking around for a familiar blond head. \u201cWhere the hell have you gotten to?\u201d</p>\n<p>Sanji doesn\u2019t answer him directly, but the sound of a fight going on up above provides all the information he needs. A glance upwards tells him that the cook has made it onto the battlements, and is going toe to toe with his former father.</p>\n<p>Never one to be left out, Zoro takes a running start and scales the side of the castle, only stopping once he\u2019s cleared the parapet and can see both combatants.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This fight\u2019s clearly been going on for a bit already because there are pieces of debris strewn all over the place. Currently, Judge and Sanji are circling each other warily, the king with a massive spear clutched in one fist, and the cook with his heels sparking.</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t even think about it, Marimo,\u201d Sanji says when he spots Zoro perched on the battlement railing. \u201cYou stay right where you are and let me handle this.\u201d</p>\n<p>His comment draws Judge\u2019s attention, and Zoro figures it\u2019s a good thing looks can\u2019t kill because if they could, the glare the older man levels his way would have him flatlining. \u201cSo,\u201d he sneers, both of his thick black eyebrows lowering in distaste, \u201cthis is the pirate hunter.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCongratulations,\u201d Sanji drawls, unimpressed. \u201cYou can read a newspaper.\u201d</p>\n<p>Ignoring him, Judge levels his spear at Zoro. \u201cYou\u2019ve caused me a considerable amount of trouble, boy. Big Mom wasn\u2019t pleased when she found out our alliance was at risk thanks to trash like you. I\u2019m out here personally to deliver not only Sanji to her, but your head as well.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut not the rest of me?\u201d Zoro asks, smirking when Judge\u2019s face goes nearly purple with rage. \u201cSeems unfair for the cook to get special treatment, but I guess it\u2019s your call.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m going to enjoy killing you,\u201d Judge growls.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cLike hell you are,\u201d Sanji barks, stomping his foot to make the <em> diable jambe</em>\u2019s flame burn brighter. \u201cYou\u2019re not laying a hand on him <em> or </em>anyone else on my crew.\u201d</p>\n<p>He jumps then, the leap planting him firmly in Judge\u2019s orbit and forcing the king to bring up his spear in a defensive position. The two of them clash back and forth, repeatedly exchanging blows while Zoro sizes up the situation.</p>\n<p>Judge is strong, that much is clear. He\u2019d have no problem defeating the young boy Sanji had once been, and even as a grown man it\u2019s difficult to say how well matched they are. Zoro trusts Sanji to have the upper hand, however, and is therefore content to keep only part of his attention on the father and son fight, as the rest of him focuses on the Germa foot soldiers.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s hard to tell thanks to the way their uniforms include masks that cover their eyes, but a number of the approaching men seem to have similar bone structure and body posture. Yet Zoro doesn\u2019t have long to consider this because the crowd is moving forward at speed.</p>\n<p>Zoro suspects it\u2019s their intention to go to Judge\u2019s aid, and probably try to subdue Sanji since they need to take him down alive. Given that, as far as he\u2019s concerned, no one has any right to impede a clash that\u2019s so long overdue, the swordsman opts to leapt from the battlements, landing directly in the path of the incoming soldiers.</p>\n<p>Not a single man among them balks. They all continue streaming towards him, none of them showing even the slightest flicker of emotion. Now certain Judge\u2019s done something to these men, Zoro draws all three of his swords, confident he\u2019s going to have to take every last one of them down to stop them.</p>\n<p>Luckily for him, while the soldiers are definitely strong and well trained, none of them seem to have the enhancements that have been built into the Vinsmoke brothers. That\u2019s good, because even he\u2019d have a difficult time with an entire army of men like that.</p>\n<p>As it stands, he still finds himself struggling slightly due to the sheer weight of numbers, but even that is largely an exercise in endurance. The Germa soldiers keep coming, exactly as he\u2019d expected, yet they can\u2019t bring him down.</p>\n<p>This gets further solidified when Luffy arrives with a whoop, both Brook and Franky hot on his heels. A quick glance at the water reveals that the situation on the <em> Sunny </em> is largely under control, so the captain must have decided to branch out and come find himself some new enemies to fight.</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t bother the cook, Luffy!\u201d Zoro shouts around Wado\u2019s hilt. \u201cKeep the path clear, but leave his old man to him.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, I know!\u201d Luffy shouts back, extending one leg in a whipping movement that sends dozens of soldiers flying. \u201cI won\u2019t mess with Sanji\u2019s fight.\u201d</p>\n<p>That\u2019s good, Zoro thinks. Wondering how said fight is going, he cranes his neck around for a quick look.</p>\n<p>Sanji and Judge have paused again, and have gone back to circling each other like a pair of large predators waiting to pounce. Both of them show the signs of wear and tear that only comes from a hard fought battle, but Judge has definitely gotten the worst of it. One of his eyes has been reduced to a bloody mess, and he\u2019s breathing raggedly in a way that can only mean he\u2019s got several cracked or broken ribs.</p>\n<p>Zoro smirks, he\u2019s gotten a few of those from Sanji over the years due to mishaps during their sparring matches, and he\u2019s someone who\u2019s well aware of the power built into the blond\u2019s kicks. He can only imagine the damage inflicted on someone dumb enough to underestimate him.</p>\n<p>This fight\u2019s as good as over. The princes and princess are contained, most of the soldiers are down or going to be that way soon, and the king himself has bitten off more than he can chew. Allowing himself a knowing smirk, Zoro pulls back from the fray, intending to leave the rest to Luffy and the others so he can watch Judge fall.</p>\n<p>The king is speaking when Zoro walks over to the perimeter of the fight. His lip is curled in a disgusted sneer, and he\u2019s glaring at Sanji as best as he\u2019s able thanks to his damaged eye.</p>\n<p>\u201c - you really think this means anything?\u201d Judge is snarling once Zoro comes within earshot. \u201cThe rest of the fleet has already been summoned, and as soon as they arrive we\u2019ll - \u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLose even more badly than you already have?\u201d Sanji drawls lazily. \u201cFace it, you old prick, your strongest fighters couldn\u2019t take us down. All throwing a bunch of stupid clones at us is going to do is cost you more manpower. Show a little humility and get the fuck out of here.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou don\u2019t get to give me orders, <em> boy</em>,\u201d Judge spits. \u201cYou\u2019re still as weak and useless as ever. You\u2019ve just been lucky enough to ally yourself with powerful people, that\u2019s all.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sanji laughs. \u201cI\u2019m one of the strongest fighters on this crew,\u201d he says, while Zoro nods approvingly. \u201cHonestly, I\u2019m kind of glad this mess has gone down because now it means I know firsthand how weak <em> you </em>are.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHow dare you!\u201d Judge starts, and Sanji\u2019s scoffs.</p>\n<p>\u201cHow dare I?\u201d He demands, his eyes narrowing dangerously. \u201cWhat about how dare <em> you </em> ? Never mind how you treated me as a kid, you attacked my home, my <em> family,</em>\u00a0completely unprovoked and with every intention of killing the most important people in my life. That\u2019s not a response that\u2019s warranted by me refusing to marry some woman you picked out.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh because you picked such a grand prize on your own,\u201d Judge says sarcastically, his good eye flirting over to look at Zoro. \u201cLook at him,\u201d he scoffs, \u201ca ragtag street rat from the East Blue with nothing to his name.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t you dare talk about him like that!\u201d Sanji snaps with surprising venom. \u201cHe\u2019s a thousand times the man you\u2019ll ever be, and he\u2019s not no one. He\u2019s going to be the greatest damn swordsman the world has ever seen.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNot if he\u2019s dead,\u201d Judge says coolly.</p>\n<p>His tone, his expression, his entire countenance - all of it - are a complete reversal from what he\u2019s just been showcasing. Moving almost lazily, he brings a hand up and presses a button on the inside of his armoured wrist. It depresses with a faint click, and then the entire world goes crazy.</p>\n<p>Explosions ring out all along the battlements, including right next to where Zoro\u2019s standing. The conclusive force knocks him off his feet, and it\u2019s only his observation haki flaring that sends him rolling to the side at the last minute and saves his life.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, it doesn\u2019t prevent him from getting hit entirely.</p>\n<p>No doubt having known where the blasts were going to be and reacting accordingly, Judge had anticipated where Zoro was going to land. His spear comes down in what would have been a killing blow had he not moved, and still manages to tear a large chunk out of his side as he\u2019s tumbling across the stonework.</p>\n<p>Zoro bellows, more in rage than anything else, and tries to get his hands under him so he can grab one of his swords. To hell with what he\u2019d promised Sanji, this just got even more personal and he wants some of his own back.</p>\n<p>He sees Judge looming over him, and manages to get his hand around Wado\u2019s hilt, only to flinch in surprise, the motion sending a fresh wave of blood coursing over his torso, as Sanji appears in his vision.</p>\n<p>His mouth twisted in rage, the cook grabs Judge by the collar of his suit, dragging him down so they\u2019re at eye level. \u201cBig mistake,\u201d he snarls in the older man\u2019s face. \u201cI can forgive or at least ignore a lot offences, but that\u2019s not one I\u2019m about to take lying down. He\u2019s <em> mine</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>Judge\u2019s good eye widens, and so too does Zoro\u2019s own. Sprawled out as he is in a pool of his own blood, the swordsman watches with one hand clamped around his injured side while Sanji releases his grip only to spin around and slam the back of his foot into Judge\u2019s jaw.</p>\n<p>Blood, spit, and at least one tooth spray across the battlement. Even better, a sharp crack rings out in a clear indication of a broken jaw. Then, as Zoro watches, Judge\u2019s eye rolls back and he hits the ground with a meaty thud.</p>\n<p>\u201cGood riddance.\u201d Sanji spits, but barely takes a moment to contemplate his victory before whirling around and sprinting in Zoro\u2019s direction.</p>\n<p>\u201cMarimo!\u201d He yelps, and it\u2019s only when he lands on his knees next to Zoro and there appear to be two of him that the swordsman realizes the wound might be a little worse than he\u2019d first thought. \u201cShit, that\u2019s a lot of blood.\u201d</p>\n<p>Glancing down at himself, Zoro\u2019s forced to grunt in acknowledgement. It <em> is </em>a lot of blood, and probably explains the sudden dizziness. Still, he\u2019s sure he\u2019s had worse before and lived to tell the tale.</p>\n<p>\u201cM\u2019fine,\u201d he mutters, frowning in confusion when Sanji doesn\u2019t look reassured. \u201cS\u2019no big deal.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI think we\u2019re going to let Chopper be the judge of that,\u201d Sanji replies. Craning his neck around, he twists until he spots a friendly face in the distance. \u201cOi, Franky! Zoro\u2019s hurt! Find Chopper, and get him over here on the double.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFuck, Cook, I don\u2019t need Chopper.\u201d Zoro says, or tries to anyway. What actually happens is he moves to push himself into a sitting position, and winds up crashing down onto his back instead.</p>\n<p>\u201cZoro!\u201d Sanji shouts, scrambling forward on his hands and knees and pawing at the fallen man. \u201cHey, look at me, Zoro. Come on, look at me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Zoro tries, he really does, but he\u2019s having more and more trouble focusing, and Sanji looks so sad all of a sudden that it hurts to look at him. Almost idly, he wonders why the other man is so upset after he\u2019s just soundly beaten his oldest enemy.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey, hey, you need to stay awake!\u201d Sanji insists. Leaning forward, he hooks a hand around Zoro\u2019s jaw and tilts his face upwards. \u201cEyes on me, darling. Don\u2019t you dare try to sleep right now. You can nap as much as you want later.\u201d</p>\n<p>Zoro frowns, the cook\u2019s words managing to break through the fog his brain has become, and making him cringe. After everything they\u2019ve faced today, Sanji\u2019s still keeping up his stupid act, which stings more than it has any right to.</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d he rasps, blood trickling out of his mouth as he forces the words out. \u201cDon\u2019t call me that if you don\u2019t mean it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCall you -?\u201d Sanji says, cutting himself off as his eyes go wide. \u201cOh shit! Wait, what do you mean \u2018if I don\u2019t mean it\u2019? What are you saying? Oi, Mossball, answer me!\u201d</p>\n<p>He sounds frantic enough and insistent enough that Zoro would really like to. Unfortunately, his body appears to have other ideas, and the last thing he sees is Sanji shouting to someone in the distance, demanding that they hurry up and move faster.</p>\n<p>*****</p>\n<p>Zoro wakes with a dull ache in his side and the sensation that his mouth is full of cotton balls. All too familiar with the symptoms of anesthesia, he cracks his eye open and is greeted by the well known sight of the <em> Sunny</em>\u2019s infirmary ceiling.</p>\n<p>\u201cShit,\u201d he grunts, bringing one hand up to scrub tiredly at his eye. \u201cNot again.\u201d</p>\n<p>Not enjoying how weak he feels, he lets his hand flop back down onto the bed. He then moves to try and shift the other one, only to realize he can\u2019t because there\u2019s a heavy weight pressing down on top of it.</p>\n<p>Confused, he tilts his head sideways, just far enough to get a look, and promptly jerks in surprise when he\u2019s greeted with the sight of Sanji, sound asleep with Zoro\u2019s arm underneath him. The motion sets his whole side throbbing and pulls a pained noise from him without his permission.</p>\n<p>He freezes, hoping he wasn\u2019t loud enough to wake his sleeping companion, but no such luck. Sanji starts stirring while Zoro\u2019s still trying to get his breathing under control and he lifts his head from where it\u2019s been pillowed on his arms, blinking sleep out of his eyes.</p>\n<p>It takes him a second to realize Zoro\u2019s conscious, but when he does, said eyes go wide and he leans forward in a rush. \u201cYou\u2019re back,\u201d he breathes, eyeing Zoro up and down like he\u2019s half afraid this is some kind of fakeout. Of note, he keeps one hand curled loosely around Zoro\u2019s own.</p>\n<p>\u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d He asks then. \u201cAre you okay? Do you need anything? Should I get Chopper?\u201d</p>\n<p>What Zoro needs is a moment to parse through that barrage of questions. Once he thinks he\u2019s got them all, he runs his tongue over dry lips, and says, \u201cA little sore, but fine, yes, no, and no.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHuh?\u201d Sanji replies, indicating that even he hadn\u2019t really known what he was saying. \u201cNever mind, I\u2019m getting Chopper.\u201d</p>\n<p>Moving on instinct, Zoro grabs for the hand resting atop his own, clutching it tightly in order to keep the cook from going anywhere. \u201cDon\u2019t even try it,\u201d he says, provided with an admirable rush of clearheadedness as he remembers what Sanji had been saying right before he\u2019d passed out on the Germa flagship. \u201cTalk to me first.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sanji looks down at their joined hands before peering up at Zoro. \u201cUm, what about?\u201d</p>\n<p>Zoe squeezes his hand tighter. \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d He asks dryly.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Sanji swallows and looks away. \u201cI haven\u2019t the faintest idea.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBullshit,\u201d Zoro replies, yanking at his hand until he turns back around to scold him for moving too much. \u201cYou called me darling,\u201d he says, once those blue eyes are back on him. \u201cRight before I went under, I heard you.\u201d</p>\n<p>A blush spreads across the bridge of Sanji\u2019s nose, but he maintains eye contact this time. \u201cI did,\u201d he agrees levelly. \u201cAnd you told me not to unless I meant it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, well,\u201d Zoro shrugs. \u201cThere was no one around to keep up the act for, and it was hard enough hearing you say things you didn\u2019t mean when there was.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDamnit, Curls.\u201d Huffing in exasperation, Zoro moves to start untangling their hands. \u201cWhy do you fuckin\u2019 think? Because I\u2019m into you, obviously.\u201d</p>\n<p>In answer, Sanji wraps his free hand around the one Zoro\u2019s trying to pull away, effectively thwarting his efforts. \u201cSince when?\u201d He demands, his gaze now so heavy it\u2019s like his eyes are boring holes into Zoro\u2019s prostrate form. \u201cSince fucking when?\u201d</p>\n<p>Zoro groans, unable to believe he has to answer this and wanting to kick himself in the head for starting the conversation. \u201cI dunno, a while? Back before Thriller Bark at least.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBefore - that was <em> over two years ago</em>!\u201d Sanji shrieks. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you say anything? Were you \u2026\u201d He pauses then, looking unsure of himself. \u201cWere you ashamed of how you felt?\u201d</p>\n<p>Zoro takes a deep breath in through his nose and lets it out slowly, all while reminding himself that, given what he\u2019s learned about Sanji recently, this is probably a logical conclusion on his part, as opposed to the absolute idiocy it sounds like.</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>No</em>,\u201d he insists, once he\u2019s certain he can safely speak again. \u201cI just didn\u2019t think you\u2019d ever be interested, and I didn\u2019t want to screw up the dynamic we already had.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell that\u2019s stupid,\u201d Sanji declares. \u201cDon\u2019t you think I had a right to know?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy? So you could spend all your time coming up with creative ways to tell me to go take a hike?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>No</em>,\u201d Sanji shoots back, as forcefully as Zoro had. \u201cSo I could make an informed decision, of course. If the past few weeks have taught me anything, it\u2019s that you don\u2019t entirely suck as a boyfriend, you know.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Hah</em>?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHusband. Fake husband.\u201d Sanji clarifies, pulling one hand back so he can wave it around for emphasis. \u201cWhatever title you want to give it, my point stands. You have been surprisingly attentive as a partner, and I want to know if that was <em> you </em> acting or if it was something else.\u201d</p>\n<p>Zoro stares at him, trying to figure out what the proper response is here, and in the end decides the only way out is to tell the whole truth. \u201cI wasn\u2019t trying to manipulate you, or anything,\u201d he hedges. \u201cI was just \u2026 maybe okay with having a chance to treat you the way I\u2019d always wanted.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sanji lurches like he\u2019s been punched, but recovers with remarkable speed. \u201cSo, what I\u2019m hearing,\u201d he says, holding up a hand to keep Zoro from interrupting, \u201cis that all this,\u201d the same hand now moves in a large circle, as if trying to emphasize everything between them, \u201cwas just genuinely you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c \u2026 yeah.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHuh.\u201d Leaning back in his seat, Sanji mouths something to himself that Zoro can\u2019t make out and then nods, seemingly having come to a decision. \u201cI\u2019m going to kiss you now. Please don\u2019t panic and try to stab me in response.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSay what?\u201d Zoro blurts, the second word getting lost in the press of Sanji\u2019s lips on his.</p>\n<p>As first kisses go, it starts out kind of mediocre thanks to the way Zoro\u2019s pretty sure he\u2019s hallucinating. Then Sanji leans in to deepen it, and his free hand comes up to cup Zoro\u2019s jaw, while the other one remains tangled with the swordsman\u2019s own - after which, Zoro decides that, to hell with whether or not he\u2019s imagining things, he\u2019s not passing this opportunity up.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou - \u201d He tries when Sanji breaks the kiss and pulls back just enough to give him some breathing room.</p>\n<p>\u201cMe,\u201d Sanji agrees, shifting slightly to press a kiss to the tip of Zoro\u2019s nose. \u201cWill you punch me if I do that again?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMight punch you if you don\u2019t,\u201d Zoro decides, rallying enough to get at least some of his faculties back. \u201cAre you sure about this though?\u201d</p>\n<p>In answer, Sanji starts pressing a bunch of featherlight kisses to the hinge of Zoro\u2019s jaw. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be here if I wasn\u2019t serious,\u201d he promises. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t do that to you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u201cAlso,\u201d he adds, \u201cI\u2019ve kinda been wanting to do it since the night of the goodbye feast on Zou. Had to fight the urge when I was sitting in your lap.\u201d</p>\n<p>Zoro supposes that makes two of them, although in his case there\u2019s no way he\u2019d have believed it wasn\u2019t part of the charade had Sanji actually done it at the time. \u201cThis way\u2019s better,\u201d he decides, grinning when Sanji presses a kiss to his cheek.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh yeah, nothing says romance like a deathbed confession,\u201d he mutters, rolling his eyes.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Zoro tilts his head up just enough to catch the blond\u2019s lips with his own. \u201cI\u2019m not dead,\u201d he says, and thankfully stops himself from following that up with some crack about nevertheless feeling like he\u2019s in heaven. He blames whatever drugs Chopper gave him for that thought even crossing his mind.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re not,\u201d Sanji agrees, pressing their foreheads together. \u201cAnd, much though it pains me to admit it, I\u2019m kind of glad about that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAsshole,\u201d Zoro murmurs, going in for yet another kiss.</p>\n<p>Sanji allows it, but presses him back into the mattress when he tries to repeat the motion. \u201cGod, you\u2019re insatiable. And <em> injured</em>. No funny business while you\u2019ve still got a crater sized hole in your stomach.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s not my fault,\u201d Zoro grumbles. \u201cSpeaking of, what happened with the rest of the fight?\u201d</p>\n<p>In answer, Sanji smirks impossibly wide. \u201cWe kicked their asses and then destroyed every laboratory we could track down. Not only is Germa no longer a threat to anyone, but they\u2019re of no use to Big Mom either.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh gee, that\u2019s so sad,\u201d Zoro says without an ounce of sympathy in his voice. He snorts. \u201cI bet Judge was pissed.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou know, I think he might have cried?\u201d Sanji says thoughtfully. \u201cI\u2019ll be honest, though, I\u2019ve spent most of my time in here with you. What happens to those fuckers is of little interest to me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGood,\u201d Zoro tells him. \u201cThey don\u2019t deserve your attention.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUnlike you, right?\u201d Sanji asks, laughing when Zoro shrugs innocently. Propping one elbow on the bed, he rests his chin in his hand while he uses the other to lift Zoro\u2019s and press a kiss to his knuckles. \u201cI\u2019m onto you, Mossball.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI never pretended to be selfless,\u201d Zoro replies. \u201cGet used to it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAs it happens, I think there\u2019ll be a lot of things for me to get used to,\u201d Sanji says. \u201cHowever,\u201d he adds, now making like he\u2019s about to climb to his feet. \u201cI really should go find Chopper so he can examine you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, you should stay right here,\u201d Zoro says, hauling back on his arm to stop him from leaving. \u201cChopper\u2019ll be by to check on me before you know it, he always is.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCareful,\u201d Sanji insists, swaying backwards slightly thanks to the force of Zoro\u2019s hold. \u201cIf I fall on you, it\u2019s going to be your own fault.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThen maybe you should lay down so we don\u2019t have to worry about it.\u201d Zoro suggests, liking that idea the more he thinks about it. \u201cC\u2019mon, Curls. If I have to be bedridden, the least you can do is keep me company.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s not enough space,\u201d Sanji protests.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cThere is.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIs not.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCook. <em> Sanji</em>.\u201d Zoro says, delighting in the way his use of his given name makes the other man flush. \u201cI\u2019m injured. Humour me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe point is to keep you from being further injured - oh, alright, stop pouting.\u201d Rolling his eyes hard enough he\u2019s lucky he doesn\u2019t strain something, Sanji gives the bed a wary look. \u201cThis really isn\u2019t made for two people.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGuess we\u2019ll have to get real close then.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sanji groans. \u201cThat was terrible. <em> You\u2019re </em>terrible. I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m attracted to you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Zoro would consider feigning hurt, but Sanji\u2019s climbing carefully into the bed even as he complains, so frankly he\u2019s pretty content with his current circumstances. He waits for the other man to get properly settled, and then curls an arm around his waist contentedly.</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you good?\u201d Sanji asks. \u201cI\u2019m not hurting you, am I?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m good,\u201d Zoro assures him. \u201cAre you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI - ,\u201d Sanji bites his lip, his cheeks reddening. \u201cI\u2019m great, no problems here.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCurls,\u201d Zoro says pointedly, well aware the other man isn\u2019t being entirely honest with him. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s just - ugh, this is so embarrassing, and I\u2019ll kick your ass if you tell anyone about it. Would you,\u201d Sanji takes a deep breath and refuses to meet Zoro\u2019s eye, \u201cdo that thing you do?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat thing?\u201d Zoro asks, genuinely confused.</p>\n<p>Sanji wriggles his back awkwardly in response, and it takes Zoro longer than it should clue in.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou mean this?\u201d He asks, starting to slowly trail his fingers up and down Sanji\u2019s back in a move he refuses to call a caress.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Sanji says, now sighing happily. \u201cThat\u2019s exactly what I meant.\u201d</p>"
