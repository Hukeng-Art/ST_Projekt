  "text": "<p>This is sort of dumb, but Leia finds out she\u2019s pregnant from the Force. Honestly, though, she\u2019s got more going on than any self-respecting twenty-five-year-old should and she only signs stuff from medical that\u2019s approving her pilots to go back on duty. The last time she got a head cold was like five or six years ago and she\u2019d spent most of it in a safehouse on Grizmallt, blowing her nose into Han\u2019s spare shirts vindictively and melting protein rations into soup over a plasma torch. Doctors are a waste of time.</p>\n<p>\u201cClearly not,\u201d Luke says. \u201cAren\u2019t you worried about somebody intercepting this transmission?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWho, those dickheads from Ren?\u201d Leia says. \u201cPlease, if they could intercept one percent of our transmissions I\u2019d have actual work to do and I wouldn\u2019t be wasting my time calling you.\u201d</p>\n<p>At the other end of the connection, Luke is frowning from underneath his overdramatic hood. He\u2019s growing a beard, she thinks--the connection is fuzzy--but it\u2019s coming in patchily and makes him look like the kind of drunk you find dead face-down in a puddle. Han\u2019s people, if you will.</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t know why you need my help,\u201d Luke is saying. The beard is distracting, Leia keeps wanting to laugh. \u201cYou tell Han you\u2019re having a baby, he cries, you have the baby. What part of this do you need my help with?\u201d</p>\n<p>Leia says, \u201cI don\u2019t need your help, I\u2019m asking if the Force is working properly.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat sounds like you need my help,\u201d Luke tells her. Leia isn\u2019t sure which of them is older--it\u2019s definitely her--but Luke sounds right now like he\u2019s jockeying for the position.</p>\n<p>Through her teeth, Leia says, \u201cI\u2019m asking you to humor me; there\u2019s a difference. Should it feel like happy indigestion? That\u2019s what it feels like.\u201d</p>\n<p>Leia\u2019s office has been equipped with a comm system the entire time she\u2019s been stationed here, but she\u2019s never used it before; the one in the main briefing room is bigger and Leia\u2019s rarely needed privacy to yell at somebody over a transmission. It\u2019s weird how intimate it feels when Luke\u2019s face is so tiny, projected right in front of hers. Even the stupidity of his beard isn\u2019t enough to shake off the sensation of closeness. Maybe it\u2019s making her even fonder of him, like some kind of psychological torture.</p>\n<p>Luke\u2019s face twists. \u201cI honestly have never been in a position to know if pregnancy feels like happy indigestion.\u201d</p>\n<p>Leia is going to burn that stupid beard right off of his stupid face. \u201cYou\u2019re an idiot,\u201d she tells him flatly. If she puts her hand over her stomach--over her uterus, really--she can feel something there. Not with her hand, but with a kind of extension of her hand, an extraneous nerve ending she can\u2019t see. Something is roiling just out of focus.</p>\n<p>Luke rolls his eyes so hard that part of his face goes out of frame.</p>\n<p>\u201cCongratulations,\u201d Leia says, \u201cyou\u2019re going to be an uncle,\u201d and then she signs off.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>Luke shows up on a supply transport one twelve-day week later, stepping dramatically off of the freighter and flipping his hood down in the middle of the crowded flight deck. Leia\u2019s nearby because Han is under the impression that he\u2019s going to man the next supply freighter to Gan Moradir, even though there are warrants for his arrest out in seventeen planets in that system.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat are you going to do when you end up in jail?\u201d Leia is yelling at him. \u201cBecause I\u2019m not going to waste valuable resources sending a lawyer to bail you out!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI didn\u2019t ask for a lawyer!\u201d Han is yelling back. The supply freighter lands behind him; a passel of deck monkeys run out to deal with it. \u201cI didn\u2019t ask your opinion at all, in fact!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, and that\u2019s just one of your many problems,\u201d Leia says. \u201cIncluding delusions, apparently. There\u2019s plenty of actual work you could be doing that would be useful, instead of galavanting off to play the charming smuggler--\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Galavanting</em>?\u201d Han hisses. This is when the landing deck yawns open and the freighter\u2019s crew jumps out to meet the deck monkeys. There\u2019s a lot of back-slapping and yelling, which is difficult to make out over Han putting a hand to his chest like he\u2019s Leia\u2019s Great-Aunt Silara and saying, \u201c<em>Playing</em>?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou can smuggle on your own time,\u201d Leia says. \u201cYou get a dozen vacation days a year just like everybody else. But on my time, on Alliance time, you do what I tell you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFirst of all,\u201d Han says, \u201cyou don\u2019t technically outrank me anymore, <em>General Organa</em>. Second of all, in what universe have I ever gotten a dozen vacation days from this measly--\u201d</p>\n<p>Luke steps off of the freighter, pauses, and throws back his hood. The sunlight glints on his hair and his now slightly less patchy beard, making him look regal to anybody within eyesight who\u2019s too dumb to know that her brother is actually an idiot. There\u2019s a sort of gasp as everybody sucks in air--except for Han, still complaining about the vacation days that he would know about if he\u2019d ever bothered to read his employment contract--and then it erupts into hysterical shrieking. It comes out as a kind of mass <em>MASTER LUKE</em>.</p>\n<p>\u201cMaker fucking save me,\u201d Leia mutters under her breath.</p>\n<p>Han half-turns and, seeing Luke, says, \u201cWhat disaster\u2019s brought him home?\u201d</p>\n<p>It\u2019s probably not the Force that makes Leia\u2019s stomach feel like it swoops down into her knees.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey, kid,\u201d Han continues as Luke pushes through his crowd of well-wishers to come say hello. There\u2019s a sort of respectful circle forming around Luke, like people are too afraid to actually hug the only known living Jedi Knight etcetera etcetera etcetera, which is hilarious on multiple levels. \u201cI almost didn\u2019t recognize your face under that dead vole.\u201d He pulls Luke in for a rough hug; this makes the people talk even more loudly. There\u2019s a kind of festive feel to the moment. How long has it been since Luke\u2019s come to see them? Clearly too long.</p>\n<p>Leia doesn\u2019t realize she\u2019s crossed her arms over her chest until she has to uncross them to hug him. \u201cHello, Luke,\u201d she says. Even her broad irritation with Han and her minute irritation with Luke isn\u2019t enough to keep her from clasping him tightly. Her arms get swallowed up in all of his robe\u2019s accoutrements. She thinks, <em>I\u2019m happy to see you</em>, but doesn\u2019t say it because it probably won\u2019t be true as soon as she confirms why he\u2019s here.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey, sis,\u201d Luke says cheerfully. \u201cDid you get shorter while I was gone, or?\u201d</p>\n<p>Leia punches him in the kidney.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course I came because you\u2019re pregnant,\u201d Luke says. He has his <em>who, me? I\u2019m just an innocent moisture farmer from Tatooine</em> eyeballs wide open and blinking dewily. \u201cMy only sister! Pregnant!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI am going to suffocate you with your own cloak,\u201d Leia threatens.</p>\n<p>Apparently the Force tells Luke that this is not a viable threat; he folds his hands into the sleeves of his cloak and smiles at her. \u201cHave you told Han yet?\u201d he asks her. He\u2019s made the mistake of agreeing to meet Leia in her office, which is a tactical loss on his end. Leia occupies herself with shuffling a pile of datapads and transmission read-outs.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d she says when she\u2019s good and ready, which is about thirty seconds later. Luke hasn\u2019t said anything in this interim, but Leia can feel his eyes boring into the top of her skull. \u201cIt hasn\u2019t come up yet.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not just going to come up,\u201d Luke says. \u201cUnless you\u2019re referring to vomit.\u201d</p>\n<p>Leia makes a face at Luke for this. Clearly, traveling around the universe and kidnapping Force-sensitive toddlers from their parents has not done anything to improve his peasant humor.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re accusing me of having peasant humor, aren\u2019t you?\u201d Luke asks. His eyes have narrowed now and they make him look like a very unattractive greeper. Leia is Force-sensitive, just like Luke\u2019s kidnapping victims, so she can feel the edges of his mind sort of prodding hers. It\u2019s a weird feeling that Leia 100% doesn\u2019t like; it reminds her too much of being fourteen and having to yell for her parents not to come into her room when they knocked.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Leia says. She can\u2019t even begin to think of all the ways she doesn\u2019t want to think about her parents. \u201cI\u2019m accusing you of being ugly.\u201d</p>\n<p>Luke stops looking narrow-eyed. \u201cIt\u2019s your gene pool too,\u201d he says. \u201cMaybe your baby is going to look like me.\u201d He stops short of actually fluffing his hair but Leia can read his telegraphed intent like he\u2019s on the other side of a sparring mat. Of all the stupid stuff General Kenobi did in his life, introducing Luke to Han was definitely up there amongst the stupidest. \u201cWouldn\u2019t that be lucky?\u201d</p>\n<p>In lieu of a verbal response, Leia huffs, \u201cHm!\u201d pointedly and looks at Luke\u2019s muddy boots, which are propped on the edge of her desk.</p>\n<p>Ignoring this, Luke returns to his original point. \u201cI don\u2019t understand why you can\u2019t just tell him. It\u2019s not like space scurvy, he\u2019s definitely going to notice a baby running around in eight--eight?\u201d He looks at Leia\u2019s stomach, frowns, says, \u201cEight and a half months.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBabies don\u2019t run, idiot,\u201d Leia says. She pointedly flicks another look at Luke\u2019s boots. If any of that mud gets on her transmission print-outs, she\u2019s going to make him copy them out by hand. \u201cToddlers run. Babies have to be carried around like drums of protein rations.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sounding repressive and annoyed, Luke says, \u201cDon\u2019t you sound excited to be a mother.\u201d</p>\n<p>Even the word makes Leia cringe. \u201cI don\u2019t have to be excited,\u201d she tells him. She can hear how tight her voice gets, choked in the middle of her throat like a gloved hand. \u201cI don\u2019t know why you even bothered coming. Don\u2019t you have children to kidnap from their parents somewhere off in the galaxy? Who\u2019s even watching them with you here?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe kids are fine,\u201d Luke says. He\u2019s gone from annoyed to concerned, eyebrows tightly together in the middle of his forehead. \u201cMara\u2019s watching them. It\u2019s fine, they always listen better to her anyway. Look, Leia, if this is about Vader--\u201d</p>\n<p>Leia says, \u201c<em>Get your boots off of my desk</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>Luke puts his feet on the floor.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>That night, Leia dreams about a long, cold corridor. All sides of it are made of molded plastic, white and hard, and Leia is riding R2D2 like a tauntaun down it, holding onto his antenna for balance. She\u2019s very concerned about her stability but she knows that she shouldn\u2019t put her feet on the floor. Somebody\u2019s chasing her; steady, measured steps that make her shiver. Her grip on R2D2\u2019s antenna is slippery, her palm clammy from sweat.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey,\u201d Han says. Leia jerks awake to find him staring down at her, most of his hair standing upright with the front all mashed down. He looks ridiculous. \u201cYou okay?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Leia says groggily. Han normally sleeps up against her back, both arms curled around her neck <em>to get a better stranglehold, princess</em>, but he\u2019s propped up and blinking down at her. He comes awake so fast; Leia has to struggle out of sleep like she\u2019s peeling her way out of a vat of molten transparisteel.</p>\n<p>Han says, \u201cYou were saying \u2018faster, R2, faster.\u2019 Really distinctly.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cJust a dream,\u201d Leia tells him. \u201cS\u2019fine. Back to sleep.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>You</em> go back to sleep,\u201d Han says, turning in half a second from concerned to surly. It\u2019s incredible that he\u2019s awake enough to even muster real emotions. Instead of replying with words, which would take too much energy, Leia puts her hand over Han\u2019s face and pushes him away.</p>\n<p>\u201cYour nose s\u2019cold,\u201d Leia says.</p>\n<p>\u201cMph!\u201d Han replies pointedly, muffled by Leia\u2019s hand over his face. Leia is already asleep by this point; she misses the rest of whatever Han says, fingers curling against his mouth.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>Leia has hacked enough med droids in her time that she should know better, but she\u2019s also not a backwater idiot who thinks that \u201cThe Force told me\u201d is an actual test for conception. The Force had told her when Luke had nearly died in an asteroid belt off of Golm, and she\u2019d been indescribably disturbed by one of the quartermaster staff who\u2019d turned out to be a plant from those Ren dickheads, but that doesn\u2019t make it a magical baby sensor.</p>\n<p>\u201cCon-Grat-U-Lations,\u201d the med droid says, staunchly attempting enthusiasm. \u201cYou have tested 98% positive for pregnancy. I will amend your medical records accordingly.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s not necessary,\u201d Leia tries.</p>\n<p>\u201cPer executive order RA-198 from the office of General Leia Organa, all medical files are to be immediately amended at time of consultation.\u201d The med droid wheezes and then says, \u201cDo you wish to terminate your pregnancy?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUgh,\u201d Leia says.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d the med droid replies. \u201cI cannot parse your meaning. Can you please repeat your response?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Leia finally says, with great reluctance, \u201cnot at this time.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYour files have been amended, General Organa,\u201d the med droid says. \u201cShould you wish to terminate your pregnancy, assistance will be provided by myself or another med droid.\u201d With another wheeze, the med droid issues a ticker tape prescription out of the front of its chestplate. \u201cPlease follow these medical advisaries.\u201d</p>\n<p>The med droid hands Leia the thin sheet of plastic and wheels out of the room, off to perform diagnostic tests elsewhere. Leia\u2019s important enough that she\u2019d been able to call the med droid to her office and now she\u2019s sort of regretting it. Maybe the starkness of the medbay would\u2019ve helped her make a concrete decision. Rebel Alliance or not, Order of Ren nonsense or not, plenty of people in Leia\u2019s position have begun to have babies. The colony on Yavin 4 is infested with them--every time Leia stops by to have tea with retired friends, there\u2019s a passel of indistinguishable toddlers climbing over everything in reach. It\u2019s not like the worst of the war, when children were a terrible idea sure to result in stress and death. The war would have been an easy excuse.</p>\n<p>Leia tries to conceptualize herself with a baby, her abdomen distended in front of her as an incubator and nuisance. It\u2019s easy to imagine but it\u2019s happening in her head like a scene from one of her aunts\u2019 favorite torrid holo dramas--her big belly, soft music in the background, Han wearing some kind of open-necked tunic and standing behind her in front of a window.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat a bunch of bantha shit,\u201d Leia mutters to herself. She shoves the prescription up the sleeve of her jacket and goes to scare up some hot water for tea.</p>\n<p>Originally, she\u2019d figured that she would have to sneak out to a pharmaceutical droid during the supper hour--Han is a sucker for regimented meal times--but she walks out of her office straight into a petty officer who snaps her a salute and says, \u201cMa\u2019am, the <em>Millennium Falcon</em>\u2019s just taken off. General Solo wanted me to tell you that he\u2019s joined security for the supply freighter to Gan Moradir.\u201d</p>\n<p>Petty Officer Brihil has not been here long enough to know that she\u2019s been selected as the fresh meat that\u2019s easily disposable and therefore prime to bear bad news. Because of this, Leia doesn\u2019t lose her temper at Petty Officer Brihil so much as the empty corridor over her right shoulder.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat fucking piece of <em>shit</em>,\u201d Leia hisses. She clenches her fists and hears the plastic prescription in her sleeve crunch.</p>\n<p>\u201cUm,\u201d Petty Officer Brihil says, clearly realizing now that she\u2019s been played.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re excused,\u201d Leia tells her. Is she actually seeing red or is it just the sun setting? Biology is amazing. \u201cAlso, Petty Officer--the next time somebody who doesn\u2019t outrank you tells you to bring me news about General Solo, tell them to go fuck themselves.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cRight,\u201d Petty Officer Brihil says faintly. \u201cOf--course, ma\u2019am.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>Leia\u2019s mother had had numerous miscarriages. <em>You were a great blessing</em>, she had said when Leia was a young child who wanted siblings; this was before they\u2019d adopted Winter and Neena. In the background, Leia could remember her father saying, <em>And our greatest curse</em>, because Leia had spent the previous month refusing to comb her hair and one of her mother\u2019s handmaidens had had to be recruited to brush out the snarls.</p>\n<p>Once Winter and Neena had come, they\u2019d needed five adults to run herd--Leia remembers this very clearly. When they were properly supervised with a ratio of more than one adult per child, it hadn\u2019t been so bad; Neena had always been the worst of them, mischievous and amoral, and Leia and Winter had been perfectly behaved so that they would look good in contrast and get extra servings of dessert. Neena always threw the tantrums.</p>\n<p>But unsupervised, their childhood had been a series of disasters. Leia had never brushed her hair and often ran away from home, Winter liked painting the cats bright colors, and Neena had been a screaming hellion who had set the summer pavilion on fire on four separate occasions, all of which she claimed to be accidents precipitated by faulty droids.</p>\n<p>Leia tries to imagine a small child with Neena\u2019s propensity for trouble loose on the <em>Falcon</em>, and it honestly makes her want to throw up.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>The Gan Moradir supply run always takes a week but Leia figures it\u2019ll take them a month because Han will surely be captured by one of his slimy underworld contacts and taken hostage and need rescuing. Luke is still lurking around, lounging in dark shadows and saying mysterious things to the youngest recruits, and Leia is ignoring him. She\u2019s taking the prenatal supplements.</p>\n<p>Six days after Han\u2019s departure, Leia is aggressively ignoring Luke as he lounges in the back of her office, supposedly fixing some kind of short in C-3PO\u2019s left leg but in reality talking to himself loudly and annoyingly. His mechanic shit is everywhere, spanners in piles on chairs and screws rolling around the floor.</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t you have somewhere better to do this?\u201d Leia asks him pointedly. \u201cLike your quarters?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMy sister isn\u2019t in my quarters,\u201d Luke says, not looking up from the inside of C-3PO\u2019s leg. \u201cI\u2019m visiting to see my sister. Hey, 3PO, are you still getting the weird feeling?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI am afraid so, Master Luke,\u201d C-3PO says fretfully. \u201cI can\u2019t <em>imagine</em> what it could be!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m here, bud,\u201d Luke says. He pulls his head out of C-3PO\u2019s leg and looks at Leia. \u201cWeren\u2019t you not talking to me?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI felt like I should register a complaint more formally,\u201d Leia says, slamming her datapad down on her desk and sending a pile of shiny junk to the floor. \u201cWhat is that?\u201d she asks him, pointing at it. \u201cWhy is this here? I run half of a Rebel Alliance out of this office and you\u2019re just piling your junk on any flat surface.\u201d</p>\n<p>Frowning, Luke says, \u201cIt\u2019s not junk, it\u2019s 3PO\u2019s peripheral nervous system.\u201d</p>\n<p>Leia rolls her eyes so hard that she almost gives herself a headache. She\u2019s opening her mouth to tell Luke where he can take C-3PO and his peripheral nervous system when the door to her office swishes open and Han is in the doorway, face red and hair standing on end.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m honestly impressed I didn\u2019t have to send a lawyer,\u201d Leia tells him. \u201cDid you shoot anybody important I should know about?\u201d</p>\n<p>Instead of addressing this legitimate concern, Han raises a finger and points it at her. His finger is shaking. \u201c<em>You!</em>\u201d he roars.</p>\n<p>\u201cMe,\u201d Leia says back flatly. \u201cWhat is it now?\u201d If anybody in this office has a reason to be angry, it\u2019s Leia, who had issued an express order to a subordinate that was subsequently ignored. Han\u2019s lucky she doesn\u2019t feel like court martialing him.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou and me are getting married, princess,\u201d Han continues, loudly, still standing mostly in the hallway. Probably half of the base is listening to this crap.</p>\n<p>\u201cHa!\u201d Leia barks.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh no,\u201d Han says, slowly and lethally. \u201cI mean it. You\u2019re knocked up? Fine. But we\u2019re getting married.\u201d</p>\n<p>That <em>rat bastard</em>. \u201cDid you tell him?\u201d Leia says, accusative, to Luke. He\u2019s staring down C-3PO\u2019s leg and avoiding eye contact.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t have to tell me, I have a flag on your medical records,\u201d Han tells her. \u201cWhat\u2019s more interesting here is that you didn\u2019t tell me, your worshipfulness.\u201d He\u2019s not quite so loud now, but Leia is too proud to pull him into her office to have this conversation in private. If he wants to have this fight in front of every petty officer between here and the Outer Rim, fine.</p>\n<p>\u201cHow dare you!\u201d Leia says.</p>\n<p>\u201cHow dare <em>you</em>!\u201d Han replies instantaneously. \u201cI mean it. Jedi Knights can perform wedding ceremonies, can\u2019t they?\u201d He says this to Luke like Leia\u2019s not in the room, being coerced into getting married to a man who literally can\u2019t stay planet-side for more than half a second before his attention span slingshots him into some kind of criminal disaster.</p>\n<p>\u201cFuck you,\u201d Leia says. \u201cWho said anything about getting married? Did <em>Luke</em> say anything about getting married?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLuke is not involved,\u201d Luke says, not looking up.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey, Luke is not involved,\u201d Han says, pointing at her. She\u2019s going to bite his finger off, then they\u2019ll see how much pointing he can do with it. \u201cThis is about you and me, princess.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s not going to be a you and me,\u201d Leia says. \u201cI\u2019m going to have this baby with C-3PO.\u201d</p>\n<p>C-3PO says, \u201c<em>Madam</em>,\u201d tremulous.</p>\n<p>Han\u2019s hands go to his hips. \u201cNice try,\u201d he says, \u201cbut we\u2019re doing this the right way. I don\u2019t know how they do it on Alderaan, princess, but on Corellia, you get married before the kid.\u201d</p>\n<p>By this point, Leia has become literally inarticulate with rage. \u201cWhat?\u201d she sputters. \u201cAre you saying we\u2019re getting married because--you--<em>you</em>--think it\u2019s--right?! Manners?!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes!\u201d Han bellows.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo!\u201d Leia tells him. \u201cI can\u2019t believe this. Get out of my office, all of you! I have a job to do that doesn\u2019t involve fucking around with you nerfherders.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t over,\u201d Han threatens. He points his finger at her again as he disappears around the corner. One day, Leia is going to cut that thing off in his sleep. There\u2019s a series of loud clattering noises in the hallway as Han stomps off, probably eavesdroppers rushing to find something less incriminating to be doing with their time.</p>\n<p>Luke finally puts down C-3PO\u2019s dismembered leg. \u201cLeia,\u201d he says slowly. There\u2019s a lot in Luke\u2019s voice, his expressive eyebrows. For years, it had been Leia and her sisters; it still strikes her at the most improbable of times that this is her twin, that long before Leia had emotionally badgered her parents into adopting siblings for her to boss around, she had shared a uterus with this uniquely irritating human being.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat goes for you and your junk, too,\u201d she tells him.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he says levelly, picking through the pile of C-3PO\u2019s nervous system parts on the floor. \u201cI got that.\u201d Leia waits but he\u2019s quiet as he picks up a tiny screwdriver and an even tinier screw. In the end, she huffs out an angry sigh and goes back to work; it\u2019s not like this base is going to run itself.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>Leia has a series of meetings during and after supper and she stays in her office another hour beyond that, late enough that the lights in the corridors have switched to after-hours half-power. Her aide is going to be ecstatic in the morning; in order to legitimately use the time, Leia had caught up on all of last quarter\u2019s financials.</p>\n<p>She\u2019s equal parts dreading Han not being in their quarters and hoping that he\u2019s sleeping in the <em>Falcon</em>; her head hurts at the temples and she wants to sit in the shower without having to worry about being ambushed with Corellian wedding customs.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, great,\u201d she says when she opens the door and Han\u2019s brushing his teeth in the attached bath, shirtless and framed by the stark light above the sink.</p>\n<p>\u201cMhmhph,\u201d Han says through a mouthful of toothpaste. He looks less red in the face but still surly. His clothes have been flung across the bed, because he\u2019s the kind of heathen who comes from a place that requires that people get married before procreating.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat was that,\u201d Leia asks tiredly, \u201cmore demands?\u201d She kicks off her boots and begins to unlace the front of her jacket.</p>\n<p>Han spits into the sink. \u201cYou look tired,\u201d he enunciates.</p>\n<p>\u201cI wonder whose fault that is,\u201d Leia says. \u201cMaybe the idiot who ambushed me in my office and told half the base that I was pregnant? Maybe they\u2019re responsible for the subsequent five hours I spent having my hand shaken by every rear admiral, captain, and commander that I came across? The petty officers just saluted.\u201d At first it had been funny.</p>\n<p>Han sticks his mouth under the faucet, gargles, and spits. Leia can\u2019t even get up the energy to wish that he would drown himself. \u201cMaybe if I hadn\u2019t found out from a tap on a med droid, I\u2019d\u2019ve been a little more friendly,\u201d he says sourly.</p>\n<p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe you hacked my medical records,\u201d Leia tells him. \u201cIt\u2019s such an incredible waste of time; I\u2019m never sick.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, it paid off, didn\u2019t it?\u201d Han holds his hand over the light switch. \u201cYou need anything in here?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d she says crabbily, peeling off her pants and then crawling across the bed. She takes care to kick all of Han\u2019s clothes onto the floor before she shimmies under the covers. \u201cIf you\u2019d taken half a second to think it through before barging into my office, maybe you would have realized that you running off deliberately against my orders didn\u2019t exactly fill me with enthusiasm to raise helpless and dependent offspring with you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Han, who had been stooping down to pick up stray shirts and pants, stops in the middle of the floor between the bed and the bathroom, arms full of clothes. \u201cHelpless and dependent? <em>Against orders</em>?\u201d</p>\n<p>After a half-second of flopping around, Leia has to sit up to punch her pillow into the right shape. \u201cI told you not to go with the supply freighter. It was a stupid move and you know it. How close did you get to being arrested?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI didn\u2019t even have time to land on Gan Moradir before I got the transmission from my tap,\u201d Han says. He\u2019s shoving their clothes into the laundry shoot in the wall as he adds, firmly but not in a combative way, \u201cBut that\u2019s not\u00a0the point. I\u2019m not here to listen to your orders, princess.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cEverybody is here to listen to my orders,\u201d Leia says. \u201cThat\u2019s the point of being a goddamn general.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNice try,\u201d Han says. He flicks off the lights as he comes to bed, but the safety lights embedded in the ceiling mean that Leia can see him still, face turned blue in the low light. \u201cYou don\u2019t outrank me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Flopping onto her side, Leia says, \u201cTechnically--\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c--technically we\u2019re the same rank,\u201d Han interrupts, sliding into the bed behind her. \u201cMaybe I don\u2019t have the blue blood, but on this base, we\u2019re the same rank. You do me the courtesy of not barking orders, I\u2019ll do you the courtesy of maybe listening.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re such an asshole,\u201d Leia says.</p>\n<p>\u201cDeal?\u201d Han asks. He shoves his hand and then arm under her neck, curving his body along her back. \u201cDo you want to take your hair down?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine for now,\u201d Leia says. Her head hurts too much to face the thought of brushing her hair out. \u201cAnd no deal. How about you do me the courtesy of not flagrantly breaking laws for an adrenaline rush and I\u2019ll stop telling the flight deck to ground the <em>Falcon</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s not a compromise,\u201d Han says into her hair. Her hand comes up to hold both of his, between her breasts and warm under the covers. The Force-feeling of riotous indigestion feels better than it has in a few days; probably it\u2019s because the bed is so warm with Han there. \u201cAnd the marriage discussion hasn\u2019t been tabled, sweetheart.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCall me sweetheart in that tone of voice <em>one more time</em>,\u201d Leia threatens sleepily.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>It takes another week for the rest of the supply freighter to make it back from Gan Moradir bearing prescription medications, drums of protein rations, and fourteen crates of QUARTERMASTER MISC. that disappears into the depths of the base before the chief deck monkey has more than half a minute to catalog their existence; Leia gets an irritated message about that that she deletes immediately.</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you even paying attention?\u201d Luke demands. Leia looks up from her datapad to see that he\u2019s standing in front of her desk, hands on his hips. After spending a few weeks on the base he\u2019s stopped with the dramatic Jedi Knight costume and is wearing a jumpsuit with patches on the elbows and inside thighs that looks like it\u2019s been repurposed from one of Leia\u2019s squadrons.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Leia says belatedly.</p>\n<p>Luke\u2019s face twitches; he\u2019s probably raising an eyebrow but Leia can\u2019t see it underneath his overgrown fringe. \u201cThis mission will have me off-world for fifteen days,\u201d he over-enunciates prissily. \u201cDo you promise not to lose your temper at Han while I\u2019m gone?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat is this, primary school?\u201d Leia says. \u201cNo, I do not promise. Take him with you if you\u2019re that worried.\u201d She uses her thumb to flick to the next page in the chief deck monkey\u2019s summary of recent transportation activity.</p>\n<p>Luke says, \u201cI can\u2019t, because he\u2019s refusing to leave.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMore repairs on the <em>Falcon</em>?\u201d Leia says distractedly, reading through the paragraph on squadron activity. The chief monkey hates her birds, that much has always been obvious, but he never fails to be scrupulously exact in his reports.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Luke says, exaggerated patience in his voice that\u2019s straight out of the Bail Organa Data Archive on Parenting, \u201che\u2019s <em>refusing</em> to <em>leave</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI <em>heard</em> <em>you</em>,\u201d Leia says right back, equally exaggerated. \u201cI\u2019m pregnant, not deaf.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCurrent evidence would suggest otherwise,\u201d Luke replies, flouncing out of Leia\u2019s office like getting the last word in this non-conversation has made him the premiere debutante of Alderaan City. Leia, deprived of any chance of a witty comeback, makes a face at his back.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>Luke\u2019s been claiming on and off for years that he can see ghosts in the Force--General Kenobi and his old teacher Yoda, mostly, and once he\u2019d gotten very drunk and told her that he\u2019d spoken with a young Anakin Skywalker but he\u2019d almost immediately started vomiting into a nearby potted miser-plant so Leia had written it off as a hallucination induced by alcohol poisoning--but Leia, who is ostensibly Force-sensitive enough to use it as a fetus-sensor, has never seen them.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s not like she\u2019d want to, really, especially not the slimy rat who donated a portion of her genetic code before swanning off to murder her entire home planet, except--well.</p>\n<p>\u201cHer name was Padm\u00e9 Naberrie,\u201d General Kenobi says. He\u2019s staring out across the back lawn of the queen\u2019s palace in the mountains; they\u2019re sitting on the front steps of the summer pavilion. In the distance, Leia can hear her sisters splashing in the shallows of the lake. They\u2019re not allowed to swim out past the tree line but she knows they will as soon as any witnesses have vanished.</p>\n<p>Leia says, \u201cWho?\u201d and then, \u201cWinter! Not past the trees!\u201d</p>\n<p>From very far away, Winter shrieks, \u201cYou\u2019re not <em>Mom</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re gonna wish Mom was here after Nanny Phillotrix is done with you,\u201d Leia yells back.</p>\n<p>\u201cYour mother,\u201d General Kenobi says.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat about her?\u201d Leia replies. She\u2019s distracted; it\u2019s going to be just her luck that her sisters will drown on her watch. If it were any other summer day she would be down there swimming with them, but it\u2019s nearly time for the Imperial Senate\u2019s third quarter to start and she\u2019s just had her hair treated before her trip off-planet. It has to dry for a few days before she can get it wet and it\u2019s still oily, heavy against her scalp.</p>\n<p>It feels oppressive in the summer heat; Leia pulls her hair over her shoulder and starts to plait it, fingers slipping easily down its length. She\u2019s much better about taking care of her hair now than she was as a child.</p>\n<p>To her left, General Kenobi says, \u201cI was there when she gave birth to you. She named you before she died, and I honored her wishes when I brought you to the prince and his wife.\u201d Leia\u2019s fingers freeze, tangled in her hair. The smell of the protective mask is so strong that she nearly thinks she\u2019s hallucinating. \u201cHer name was Padm\u00e9 Naberrie.\u201d</p>\n<p>Leia\u2019s known that she was adopted for years--<em>you were a great blessing</em>: not as ambiguous as it might have seemed--but she\u2019s never heard anyone speak of her biological parents before. \u201cReally?\u201d she asks raptly. \u201cHow did you know her?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShe was a senator,\u201d General Kenobi says. He has pale eyes, so blue in the sunlight that they\u2019re nearly translucent. Leia has known him peripherally for her entire life, a face on the other end of surreptitious transmissions. <em>A great and powerful ally</em>, her father had called him. <em>Too powerful to be called upon except in the most dire of circumstances</em>. \u201cLike yourself, I gather.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s my probationary session,\u201d Leia tells him drily. \u201cIt\u2019s a little premature to be calling me a senator just yet.\u201d</p>\n<p>General Kenobi does a funny little half-bow, aborted because he\u2019s sitting down. \u201cI don\u2019t think so,\u201d he says, cryptically. It\u2019s the kind of thing older people often say to make themselves sound more clever; it strikes Leia now as funny because General Kenobi doesn\u2019t look any older than Nanny Phillotrix, who at thirty-five is the House of Organa\u2019s youngest governess in nearly a hundred years.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, let\u2019s hope everybody else feels that way,\u201d Leia says. She doesn\u2019t want to talk about the approaching Imperial Senate session; she wants to be swimming with her sisters, trying to sneak beyond the tree line. Speaking of which--\u201cYou better not have snuck out beyond the trees!\u201d she yells towards the lake. There\u2019s a suspiciously long pause before Neena and Winter shout back that they haven\u2019t.</p>\n<p>Leia ties off her braid and flicks it back over her shoulder. \u201cWas she really a senator?\u201d she asks General Kenobi, who is probably not lying but it\u2019s worth the second query.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d General Kenobi says quietly. \u201cShe believed very strongly in the personal responsibility of galactic representatives. She was a skilled legislator and well-respected for her diplomatic abilities.\u201d After a brief pause he adds, awkwardly, \u201cShe had--hair. Like yours. She had been queen of Naboo for two terms and she knew how to use costuming to her advantage.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShe had hair,\u201d Leia says flatly, and then, \u201cNaboo? Wow. I\u2019ve seen pictures, of course, but I\u2019ve never visited--it\u2019s supposed to be really beautiful. Idyllic, I think Dad said.\u201d General Kenobi stops looking at Leia and squints at the mountains around them, wagging his head back and forth slowly. He\u2019s probably making some kind of subtle point about Alderaan and the queen\u2019s palace, but Leia ignores this. \u201cHow did she die?\u201d</p>\n<p>After a short pause, General Kenobi says, \u201cComplications.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWith the pregnancy?\u201d Leia presses.</p>\n<p>\u201cWith her husband,\u201d General Kenobi says. He\u2019s still looking towards the mountains but it seems less ironic and more evasive now.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d Leia says. It comes out as a kind of whisper.</p>\n<p>\u201cShe was, in many ways, similar to your father,\u201d General Kenobi says. \u201cShe and Bail were extremely dedicated to the ideals upon which the Republic\u2019s Senate was originally constructed. When it became clear that these ideals had been poisoned by the Supreme Chancellor, they were instrumental in establishing a resistance.\u201d He looks as though he is aging in front of Leia\u2019s eyes; there are streaks of grey running through his beard, now, the skin around his blue eyes wrinkling in the corners. \u201cI imagine she would have loved you very much,\u201d he says. \u201cShe certainly did before you were born.\u201d</p>\n<p>This time, Leia\u2019s <em>oh</em> is inaudible; she can barely breathe. The musky scent of her hair oil feels like it\u2019s choking the air before she can inhale.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy are you telling me this?\u201d she finally manages. \u201cI have parents. They love me and have taken care of me all of my life.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI would hope that they have,\u201d General Kenobi says. \u201cIt was my choice to bring you here, after all.\u201d He pauses, maybe because he can tell that Leia is feeling alarmingly light-headed. \u201cIt would mean a great deal to your mother that you are happy. As the person who took you from her arms and brought you here, I feel similarly responsible for your happiness.\u201d</p>\n<p>Leia croaks, \u201cGeneral Kenobi--\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPlease,\u201d he says, \u201cI would like it if you were to call me Ben, Leia.\u201d</p>\n<p>The heat of the summer sun becomes suddenly, incredibly unbearable and Leia has to squeeze her eyes shut. She jerks them open with an extremely unpleasant lurch to find Han holding her by both of her shoulders. \u201cHey,\u201d he says. \u201cWhat the hell was that?\u201d It takes Leia an embarrassingly long time to realize that she\u2019s crying, which is why Han looks like he\u2019s been ambushed by betrayed trading partners. \u201cLeia? Shit, hey, come on.\u201d</p>\n<p>The blue safety lights have turned Han\u2019s face a nauseating color. Leia rolls over and buries her head in his shoulder so she doesn\u2019t have to look at it, the tears leaking out of her like a broken faucet. She\u2019s making some kind of hideous droning noise.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey,\u201d Han is saying repeatedly, irritatingly. \u201cLeia, it\u2019s okay. Okay? It\u2019s okay.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>It\u2019s easy enough to assign one of the more information technology-inclined petty officers some search parameters and see what comes of it; Leia goes to her office, points at one of them, and says, \u201cGet me everything you can on Padm\u00e9 Naberrie.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMa\u2019am,\u201d says the petty officer, snapping her a salute, and she promptly vanishes.</p>\n<p>At 3600, as Leia is wrapping up for the day, the petty officer reappears with a memory stick and the hollow eyes of somebody who\u2019s spent the day staring into an archive console. \u201cEverything on Padm\u00e9 Naberrie available from our records and the holonet archives, ma\u2019am.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGood,\u201d Leia says, immediately plugging the memory stick into the side of her datapad. \u201cYou\u2019re dismissed. Go get some supper.\u201d</p>\n<p>The first file--they\u2019re organized alphabetically--is AaberVictoire_Thesis, a dissertation on political pageantry that focuses extensively on the two-term court of Queen Amidala. There are figures at the end of the document: meticulous drawings and reference captures. Everything is labeled exhaustively. Figure 65B is a capture of the Queen and her handmaidens, all dressed in orange and silver. The caption notes that the Queen is actually the second handmaiden on the left; the woman dressed in the Queen\u2019s costume is a bodyguard and double.</p>\n<p>Leia looks at the quiet, serious face of the handmaiden Padm\u00e9. She has small features and dark hair that\u2019s looped over her ears. There are captures of Leia from her time in the Imperial Senate and she never looked quite this serious and reserved; Leia has always talked too much, too loudly, to be truly elegant. Winter had been better at those lessons, with her long, delicate neck and pale hair.</p>\n<p>At first glance it\u2019s not that difficult to imagine this woman dying in childbirth. Leia should know better than to judge somebody by their height, but she finds herself doing it automatically. The longer she stares, though, the more she can see a strength of will in Padm\u00e9\u2019s bearing that belies the frailty of her frame. Those ceremonial robes have to weigh an Imperial fuckton.</p>\n<p>\u201cMa\u2019am?\u201d somebody says; Leia looks up to see Admiral Olivares leaning through the doorway to her office. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a situation.\u201d</p>\n<p>Leia says, \u201cI\u2019ll be right there,\u201d and rips the memory stick out of her datapad, already stepping around her desk in a half-sprint. \u201cBrief me as we go, admiral.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"center\">~</p>\n<p>Leia, who has known Han for many years and been sexually exclusive with him for almost as long, had been until this baby mess under the impression that the best way to distract Han from his fascination with a topic was to make it as legally binding as possible. Of course it would be marriage that would prove to be the exception.</p>\n<p>\u201cMy parents had an arranged marriage,\u201d Leia says flatly when Han says something along the lines of<em> not all of us had crowns growing up, princess</em> in the middle of some kind of execrable story about his parents and his childhood. \u201cThis fairy tale stuff you\u2019re dribbling about sounds nice or whatever but it\u2019s nonsensical.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNonsensical,\u201d Han yelps, \u201cwhat\u2019s that supposed to mean?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFull of nonsense,\u201d Leia informs him. She\u2019s kind of enjoying how purple Han\u2019s face is turning. For a guy who likes to talk about how privileged Leia\u2019s childhood must have been compared to his, he\u2019s very protective of his halcyon childhood memories. Leia has halcyon childhood memories, of course, but a lot of hers involve attempting to escape from court duties with Neena and being chased by Nanny Phillotrix across the palace grounds. \u201cLook, I don\u2019t understand why you want to get married at all. People get married because it helps with taxes, and we\u2019re technically criminals. I haven\u2019t filed a tax return since Vader destroyed my home planet.\u201d</p>\n<p>Han says, \u201cTaxes?\u201d incredulously. \u201cWho gets married for taxes?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cEverybody!\u201d Leia says.</p>\n<p>Han, who is sitting on a swivel chair in front of Leia\u2019s desk that just appeared in her office two mornings ago\u2014apparently in preparation for this exact conversation\u2014swivels around and says to Luke, \u201cWhy did your parents get married?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMy grandfather married my grandmother to free her from slavery,\u201d Luke says. He\u2019s dragged a bunch of new mechanical stuff into Leia\u2019s office so that he can keep doing droid repairs. It\u2019s cute how he thinks Leia won\u2019t notice that his bottles of WD-40 appear to be reproducing.</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Han says, swiveling back rapidly, \u201cthat sounds better than taxes, I guess.\u201d</p>\n<p>Leia asks, \u201cAre these the grandparents we share?\u201d</p>\n<p>Without looking up from the big pile of garbage he\u2019s sorting into smaller piles, Luke says, \u201cWe share all of our grandparents, Leia, that\u2019s how being co-zygotes work.\u201d</p>\n<p>Leia briefly considers telling Luke any one of her myriad stories about growing up inside of the House of Organa\u2014maybe he\u2019d like to hear about Leia\u2019s diction and comportment lessons as a child, because she\u2019d had to be fluent in the four official spoken and two sign languages of Alderaan\u2014but instead she says, \u201cWe weren\u2019t the same zygote, idiot.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI said <em>co</em>-zygotes,\u201d Luke replies irritably.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe did,\u201d Han says. \u201cEven moisture farmers on a junkyard asteroid belter like Tatooine get married for better reasons that taxes, princess.\u201d</p>\n<p>Luke says, \u201c<em>Junkyard</em>?\u201d as Leia says, \u201cTaxes are a perfectly legitimate reason for marriage and\u2014I would like to add\u2014not the reason my parents were married. Although I fail to see why my parents have anything to do with us, since they\u2019re dead and we\u2019re not getting married.\u201d</p>\n<p>With a dramatic full-body sigh, Han flops back into his swivel chair. It\u2019s a convenient prop, Leia has to give him that. She\u2019s never had any chairs in her office besides her own because standing encourages people to say their piece and not waste Leia\u2019s time. It figures that Han would come up with a way to circumnavigate that.</p>\n<p>\u201cLook,\u201d he says to the ceiling of Leia\u2019s office. \u201cWe\u2019re having this baby? Okay. We\u2019re having this baby. But the baby is coming into a family.\u201d</p>\n<p>Leia stares at him blankly. <em>We\u2019re having this baby? Okay?</em> Maker fucking wept.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d Leia says. She points at her chest and then jabs at Luke. \u201cFamily,\u201d she enunciates crisply; Aunt Celly would be so proud. She then points at Han. \u201cFamily,\u201d she repeats. \u201cWhat\u2019s the problem here? If you want more people, I hate to break it to you, but the entire rest of my family was evaporated into space and half of yours are in jail. So it\u2019s the three of us, fine. Why do we need a marriage certificate? There\u2019s not a House of Organa anymore so the point of inheritance is moot.\u201d When Han doesn\u2019t say anything she asks, \u201cIs there a House of Solo inheritance I should worry about?\u201d</p>\n<p>Han makes a face. \u201cIt\u2019s not half of my family that\u2019s in jail,\u201d he says crabbily.</p>\n<p>\u201cFine,\u201d Leia says, \u201cforty-five percent, whatever, the point still stands. You\u2019ve yet to make a compelling case, General Solo, and you\u2019re wasting my valuable time.\u201d</p>\n<p>Looking back at the ceiling, Han says, wearily, \u201cIs it not enough that I want to get married?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNot if you won\u2019t tell me why,\u201d Leia says. \u201cAnd don\u2019t throw around more of that \u2018it\u2019s the right thing to do\u2019 malarkey. I\u2019m going to believe you\u2019re selling me on the right thing to do the day that those Ren dickheads muster an attack force more destructive than a flock of can-cells.\u201d</p>\n<p>Han says, \u201cHow come it\u2019s a noble sentiment if you say it and malarkey coming from me?\u201d</p>\n<p>Leia replies, \u201cBecause I\u2019m not an itinerant moon jockey with more charge in my blaster than sense in my brain.\u201d</p>\n<p>Although Han\u2019s mouth is always opening around some kind of quick comment, he looks at Leia for five or six seconds before he answers this. \u201cOkay,\u201d he says. \u201cItinerant moon jockey, no sense, can\u2019t keep planet-side for more than a month--is this sounding right?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFor the first time, yes,\u201d Leia says.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou like that I go off-planet and get out of your hair,\u201d he points out.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to like that if there\u2019s a baby here that needs taking care of,\u201d Leia says. \u201cAnd the issue is when you ignore a direct order to go off and pursue your own criminal agenda.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou literally <em>just</em> said that we\u2019re all criminals,\u201d Han says, aggrieved, and then he swats at the air by the side of his face. \u201cNever mind that. Princess, I think the problem here isn\u2019t that you don\u2019t see the point of marriage, it\u2019s that you don\u2019t trust me.\u201d Kicking his boots up onto the side of her desk, Han interlaces his fingers and rests them on his stomach. \u201cWhat, are you too good for a Corellian scoundrel?\u201d</p>\n<p>Leia is opening her mouth to say <em>frankly, yes</em> when Luke pipes up from the corner, \u201cI think it\u2019s more complicated than that.\u201d</p>\n<p>Not taking his eyes off of Leia, Han says, \u201cShut up, Luke.\u201d His tone is almost pleasant. \u201cYou\u2019ve been running your own little rebel dictatorship for a while here, princess, and I think you\u2019ve gotten used to getting what you want. You can talk big game about diplomacy but you\u2019re shit at it. You\u2019re real good at telling people what to do and expecting them to listen. But guess what? You can\u2019t tell me what to do.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI could court martial you,\u201d Leia suggests.</p>\n<p>\u201cGo ahead,\u201d Han says. \u201cYou\u2019re shitty at diplomacy because you don\u2019t know how to compromise, princess.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, for fuck\u2019s sake,\u201d Leia snaps, \u201cnot this again.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, no, I\u2019ve been thinking about this and I\u2019m pretty sure this is true,\u201d Han says. Why is he staring at her? It\u2019s discomfiting. Normally Han stares at her because he\u2019s about to tackle her into bed or a nearby janitorial supply closet or an empty medbay cubicle. \u201cI\u2019ve made all of the compromises--I joined your stupid rebellion, I let myself be stuck in carbonite--\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou <em>let</em> yourself?\u201d Leia hisses; Han ignores her.</p>\n<p>\u201c--and I\u2019ve jumped from shit planet to shit planet for the last six years to help train your air force. I\u2019m not seeing a lot of compromising from your end, your worshipfulness.\u201d Now he looks smug, Maker knows why.</p>\n<p>\u201cI haven\u2019t throttled you yet,\u201d Leia says.</p>\n<p>\u201cI really think that it\u2019s time that you made some compromises here, too,\u201d Han continues. \u201cIf you actually objected to having this kid, you\u2019d\u2019ve had a med droid terminate it and this wouldn\u2019t be up for discussion. But you want the kid. Do you want me around?\u201d</p>\n<p>Leia stares at him moodily. \u201cDo I get a choice?\u201d she says.</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t play that,\u201d Han says. \u201cEither you think I\u2019ll stick around or you don\u2019t.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHan, every day with you brings new and unpleasant surprises,\u201d Leia tells him.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m going to stick around,\u201d Han says like Leia hasn\u2019t spoken at all. \u201cAt this point, princess, it wouldn\u2019t be worth the effort to leave. I love you, I want to get married, I want this kid. Okay?\u201d</p>\n<p><em>Okay? </em>It\u2019s unbelieveable that Leia is in love with this idiot.</p>\n<p>\u201cWow,\u201d Leia says flatly. \u201cI\u2019m overwhelmed by the strength of your feelings. Well, if it wouldn\u2019t be worth the <em>effort</em> to <em>leave</em>, why don\u2019t we just get married tomorrow?\u201d</p>\n<p>Still staring at her, beadily now, Han says, \u201cStop nitpicking what I say and actually listen, will you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Behind Han, Luke is determinedly tinkering with his nest of wires and chrome pieces. His expression is blank, his hair flopping down over his eyes and his terrible, ratty beard obscuring his mouth. This is Leia\u2019s twin, her co-zygote and occasional unwelcome guest. Normally, Leia is irritated by things she doesn\u2019t understand; something like the Force interfering in her life would pick and pick and pick at her until she couldn\u2019t see for her frustration. But she trusts the threads of the Force that connect her to her brother, even though she doesn\u2019t know why. It\u2019s the closest Leia has ever come to a leap of faith; she\u2019s too practical for much else.</p>\n<p>\u201cUgh,\u201d Leia says. Han immediately leaps out of his no doubt pilfered swivel chair and punches the air. \u201cFine,\u201d she continues, over his ecstatic whooping. \u201cWe\u2019ll get married.\u201d</p>\n<p>Han comes around her desk and picks Leia out of her chair, swinging her around and knocking important things off of her desk. Before Leia can see much of anything--too much whiplash--Han\u2019s stopped spinning and is kissing her, hard, his hand pressed to the side of her face. The other one is looped around her waist, holding her against him. She can feel his blaster pressing into her pelvic bone and it\u2019s uncomfortable but she can\u2019t muster the strength of will to wrest herself free.</p>\n<p>By the time she opens her eyes, Han looks smug and red-faced, his hair sticking up because Leia can\u2019t keep her hands to herself. He looks so stupid; it hurts Leia\u2019s chest, constricting her breathing, to look at him for very long. \u201cI knew it,\u201d he says. He\u2019s oozing self-satisfaction. \u201cI knew you\u2019d marry me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Leia tries to punch him in the kidney but he wriggles out of the way like a Rishi eel and kisses her again, distractingly and with his whole mouth--lips, tongue, teeth, sucking the air straight out of her brain.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re an idiot,\u201d Leia tells him. She means <em>I love you</em>, probably.</p>\n<p>\u201cI know,\u201d Han says.</p>"
