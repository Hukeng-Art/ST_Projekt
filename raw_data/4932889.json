  "text": "<p>They haven\u2019t moved an inch in 40 minutes.</p>\n<p>Jimin's pissed at everything. At the snow, at the assholes who won\u2019t lay off their horns, at that fucking garish yellow van stuck in the lane next to him. \u00a0Frustrated, he pulls out his phone and dials a familiar number. He grips the steering wheel hard as he listens to the line ring.</p>\n<p>\u201cHello?\u201d A gruff voice comes from the other end of the line.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou won't believe where I am right now.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cStuck on that clusterfuck of an interstate?\u201d Yoongi asks with a sigh.</p>\n<p>Jimin\u2019s brow furrows as he readjusts the phone to better hear. \u201cHow did you know?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDude, it\u2019s on the news.\u201d\u00a0 Sure enough, Jimin hears a helicopter zoom overhead. \u201cIt\u2019s gridlocked for miles. There have been like a dozen accidents on that stretch of road alone.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin's head whips around as his eyes scan the increasingly white landscape. \u201cWhere are all the emergency responders?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThere are a few out there already, but the roads iced too quickly. I mean, there\u2019s about to be a goddamn blizzard. If they send out too many tow trucks and shit right now, they said those guys will just get stuck, too. It\u2019s gonna be a while.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHow long?\u201d The silence on the other end of the line is disconcerting, and Jimin finds himself gripping the steering wheel so hard that his knuckles go white. \u201cHyung, how long?\u201d he repeats.</p>\n<p>\u201cMaybe overnight?\u201d Yoongi says reluctantly.</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you fucking kidding me? I\u2019ll freeze out here.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDon't be dramatic. I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll bring around some blankets or something.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHyung, what if I miss the wedding?\u201d Jimin whines, flexing his already-cold fingers.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou won\u2019t miss the wedding, it\u2019s not until tomorrow. Anyway, you\u2019d better not miss it. Hoseok will kill me. He says he has the perfect guy for you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin rolls his eyes. \u201cHe always says that. He just sets me up with every gay guy he meets.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe does not just set you up with every gay guy he meets. We\u2019re fucking gay too, you asshat. \u00a0Plus, he says this is different.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah right.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhatever, you\u2019d better still make it.\u201d When Yoongi speaks again, his voice is softer and tinged with an uncharacteristic note of insecurity. \u201cHow am I supposed to get married without a best man?\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin\u2019s heart gives a small, sweet pang, and he feels the beginnings of a smile creeping onto his face. \u201cI\u2019ll make it. I\u2019ll make snowshoes out of my tennis rackets and hike there if I have to.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yoongi clears his throat. \u201cGood,\u201d he grunts. \u201cText me to let me know you\u2019re okay, yeah?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWill do, hyung.\u201d</p>\n<p>He hangs up and tosses his phone onto the passenger seat, surveying his surroundings. Several people have gotten out of their cars, some talking to their neighbors, some just trying to get a better view of the road ahead. Jimin follows suit, pushing open the door and stepping outside. It feels weird, getting out of the car on the interstate, but as soon as he has a better view of the road ahead of him, he knows it\u2019s safe. The roads are a fucking mess. The jam extends as far as the eye can see, all the way to the horizon where the sun is starting to disappear. \u00a0He can see at least two minor accidents in the immediate vicinity, where the cars simply slid uncontrollably on the newly icy roads. No one seems seriously injured, and there are a few emergency responders on the road shoulder. But it\u2019s clear that nobody is going to be going anywhere for a while.</p>\n<p>\u201cShit,\u201d he says, pulling his thin coat tighter around him.</p>\n<p>\u201cBeautiful evening, eh?\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin whirls around in the direction of the voice, eyes first landing on the awful yellow Conversion van then trailing upwards to its roof where a lavender-haired man is perched comfortably with a steaming cup clutched in his hands. He\u2019s wearing sandals. Jimin\u2019s initial reaction is confusion, followed shortly by irritation.</p>\n<p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d Jimin asks without any effort to mask the annoyance in his voice.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe snow. It\u2019s beautiful, isn\u2019t it?\u201d He reaches up with his free hand to catch a few flakes and then looks back at Jimin with a bright, irresistible smile.</p>\n<p>With some effort, Jimin tears his eyes away and scoffs with as much grumpiness as he can muster. \u201cI\u2019ll have to remember to stop and admire it some other time, when it\u2019s not making my life hell.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh come on, it\u2019s like an adventure,\u201d the man says with a goofy, boxy smile.</p>\n<p>\u201cTell that to my frozen corpse in the morning,\u201d Jimin spits nastily, making for his car door.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou should pop over for a cup of hot tea before you get too corpse-y,\u201d the man shouts behind him as Jimin wrenches open the car door and slings himself inside. He slams it shut without a word or glance in the direction of the yellow van. Again, he pulls his jacket tight around him, the stiff seat creaking as he tries unsuccessfully to make himself comfortable. His hands twitch towards his keys as he briefly considers turning on the heat, but his hands falls back into his lap with a resigned sigh when he decides he can\u2019t waste the gas.</p>\n<p>He spends the next half hour observing a pair of young siblings in the car in front of him, bundled up ridiculously in every piece of clothing that their father could gather. He watches as they fight over a toy, get bored, and subsequently start making faces at the people in the cars around them. Jimin has two fingers up his nose, good-naturedly baring his teeth at the children in front of him in the most unflattering manner, when he hears the knock on his window. He jumps violently, jabbing his fingers further up his nose and wincing in pain as he pulls them out. He glances through the glass to his left, ready to murder, even readier when he sees who it is. It's the purple haired man, smiling a dopey grin, big ears sticking out from underneath his beanie.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Jimin shouts through the glass.</p>\n<p>\u201cI made you some tea,\u201d the man shouts back, a little louder than necessary.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo thanks,\u201d Jimin pouts as he turns away, frozen fingers screaming in protest.</p>\n<p>\u201cPlease? You look really cold.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d Jimin insists.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re shivering.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d he repeats with a roll of his eyes.</p>\n<p>\u201cYour lips are a little blue.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin spares a glance to the man outside. He looks like he\u2019s freezing, too. The wind and snow have picked up, and Jimin can tell even from the inside of his car that the temperature has dropped.</p>\n<p>\u201cFine,\u201d Jimin says grudgingly. \u201cYou\u2019re persistent, aren\u2019t you?\u201d He doesn\u2019t mean it as a compliment, but the man seems to take it as one.</p>\n<p>\u201cYep!\u201d he says enthusiastically, and his warm grin is completely at odds with the surroundings. Jimin pushes open the door and allows the man to press the cup into his hands, trying not to sigh audibly as the heat seeps into his nearly-numb fingers. \u00a0\u201cYou know, my van is actually pretty warm. You\u2019re welcome to hang.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUm, no thanks, I\u2019m okay here.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSuit yourself. I\u2019ll be there,\u201d the man points over his shoulder where the huge yellow van rests behind him, \u201cif you change your mind.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin merely purses his lips and raises his eyebrows in response, shutting the door rather abruptly in the man\u2019s face. Seemingly unfazed, the stranger yells over the wind, \u201cI\u2019m Taehyung, by the way.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin just waves his hand vaguely and stares pointedly in front of him until the man finally turns and starts trudging back to his van. \u00a0Only then does he take a sip of tea. This time, he does allow himself an audible, albeit reluctant, sigh. He glances down at the cup in his hands, a tacky Garfield mug. Of course.\u00a0His eyes dart rebelliously over to the vehicle beside him. The curtains in the windows of the van are drawn, and Taehyung is nowhere to be seen. Jimin wonders errantly just how exactly he managed to make tea in a van.</p>\n<p>When his cup is regretfully empty, Jimin takes a deep, bracing breath before he opens his car door and steps out into the cold. It\u2019s dark now, and it really has gotten colder. He sees emergency vehicles passing out blankets and water a few hundred yards back. Without further delay, he makes his way to the van and raps harshly three times against the window. \u00a0Within seconds, a grinning face pops up from between the curtains and the door opens.</p>\n<p>\u201cPlease, step inside my office,\u201d comes Taehyung\u2019s deep, rumbling voice as he gestures to the inside of his van.</p>\n<p>\u201cUm\u2026 no tha-\u201d Jimin starts, but he is stopped in his tracks as a wave of warm air hits him. He gazes inside, shocked by the cozy, well-lit interior. It looks like a tiny apartment, complete with a tiny kitchen. \u00a0\u201cI just came to give you back your mug.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNonsense, come inside, it\u2019s freezing out there.\u201d Taehyung grabs his wrist and physically pulls him inside. Jimin\u2019s sense of danger is almost instantly silenced as the warmth envelops his body. Taehyung shuts the door tight behind him and draws the curtains.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat the hell is this thing?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat thing?\u201d Taehyung asks as he busies himself folding a blanket on what looks like a raised sleeping area.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis thing.\u201d Jimin gestures to the van around him.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s my home,\u201d Taehyung responds like it's the most obvious thing in the world.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cYou live in a van?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes.\u00a0I\u2019m a writer.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin waits for him to continue, cocking his head confusedly as Taehyung continues to stack blankets in silence. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, am I missing something? Do all writers live in vans?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOnly the really excellent ones,\u201d Taehyung says with a smile. \u201cNo, I was writing a book, so I wanted this experience. You know, traveling across the country completely unencumbered, going wherever the wind takes me. I wanted to do it on a horse, but there were some permit issues.\" His brow furrows for just a second before he's smiling again. \"Anyway, I think the finished product is gonna be amazing. Think Jack Kerouac meets E.L. James meets Sylvia Plath.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin stares at him, dumbfounded. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, E.L. James as in... Never mind.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI actually finished up the other day and sent the draft off to my publisher. Heading back to a stationary life after this. Do you want a beer?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, I really did just come to give you back the mug. I\u2019m fine in my own car.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, come on. I have food and warmth and an extra pee bottle. It used to belong to my friend Shrimpy, but I lost him back in Busan.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat happened to Shrimpy?\u201d Jimin mutters almost fearfully, tensing a little as his eyes dart towards the door.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, he\u2019s fine. They were able to reattach the finger.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh\u2026 good\u2026\u201d He relaxes. A little.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo, what do you say?\u201d Taehyung asks excitedly, plopping himself down in front of Jimin and leaning forward excitedly. \u201cSleepover?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIf I said yes, it would go against everything my mother ever taught me about strangers and vans.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCan I tempt you with a can of Vienna sausages?\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin cringes as the image of Shrimpy\u2019s severed finger pops into his mind. \u201cUm. No.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat about a peanut butter and banana sandwich and a bottle of shitty whiskey?\u201d</p>\n<p>He knows he\u2019s going to say yes. He tries and fails to convince himself that he\u2019s staying because of the promise of food and warmth, not because of the way Taehyung\u2019s collarbones peak out from beneath his shirt, or the elegant slope of his nose, or the way he smells strangely of cotton candy and something a little spicier.</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay?\u201d Jimin responds, and it sounds like a question. But Taehyung bounces happily regardless.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis is great! Oh, right, what\u2019s your name?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cJimin.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHmm, Jimin. We haven\u2019t met before, have we?\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin scoffs. \u201cI think I would have remembered that.\u201d</p>\n<p>Taehyung appraises him through narrowed eyes. \u201cGiven your tone, I don\u2019t quite know how to take that.\u201d\u00a0Jimin shrugs halfheartedly, and after a second, Taehyung shrugs, too. Again, his smile is back in an instant. \u201cSo what do you want to do first?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna go with whiskey, whiskey first,\u201d Jimin answers with certainty.</p>\n<p>\u201cPerfect!\u201d Taehyung beams as he springs up, crouching down his head barely brushes the ceiling. He rummages through the cabinets and eventually finds what he\u2019s looking for, pulling out a nearly-full bottle of alcohol and thrusting it triumphantly over his head.</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t have any mixers, so I hope you\u2019re okay drinking cheap, room temperature whiskey out of plastic cups.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI honestly cannot think of anything I\u2019d rather do right now,\u201d Jimin says, running a hand through his hair.</p>\n<p>Taehyung smiles and goes about pouring the drinks, but he pauses halfway through and stares up suspiciously at Jimin. \u201cYou\u2019re not fuzz, are you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re breaking several open container laws right now. You\u2019re not a cop, right?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo?\u201d</p>\n<p>Taehyung\u2019s face relaxes visibly. \u201cOk good.\u201d He pulls something small and white out from behind his ear. \u201cThen wanna blaze?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cJesus Christ,\u201d Jimin exclaims. \u201cThat\u2019s not a cigarette, is it?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCigarettes are bad, Jiminnie.\u201d Taehyung smirks weirdly and digs a lighter out of his pocket. \u201cDo you smoke?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNot since college,\u201d Jimin acknowledges, eyes following Taehyung\u2019s fingers as he puts the rolled paper to his lips, flicks the lighter, and inhales. Taehyung holds his breath for a moment before exhaling slowly.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou say that like it was 84 years ago. You can\u2019t be more than 25. What has life done to you in three years?\u201d He holds out the joint, which Jimin eyes skeptically.\u00a0 Taehyung quirks an eyebrow. \u201cYou look like you need to relax.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat if they clear the roads soon?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDude haven't you been listening to the radio? They say it\u2019s going to be at least 10 hours before they can get things moving again. It\u2019s about to fucking blizzard for God's sake. Come on, it'll take the edge off. We'll sober up in no time.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin hesitates for a moment before he accepts it, bringing it to his lips and taking a long drag. He lets the smoke sit in his lungs for a moment before he exhales. \u201cFuck, that\u2019s good.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGood man. Damn, I wish I had my trombone. You haven\u2019t\u00a0<em>lived \u00a0</em>until you\u2019ve smoked out of a trombone,\u201d Taehyung says, patting him on the back and pushing a cup of whiskey forward towards him. \u201cLet us raise a glass to snow, without which, I would not have a hot stranger in my van.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin's face is warm as Taehyung smashes his cup forward into Jimin's before throwing it back. Jimin does the same, coughing violently as the whiskey hits his throat. \u201cThat is terrible whiskey.\u201d He takes another hit from the joint to ease the pain.</p>\n<p>\u201cAs God intended,\u201d Taehyung says as he pushes himself to his feet. He rummages again through the small cabinets and sets to work making the sandwiches. He wastes no time in making a magnificent mess of the tiny countertop.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis is the weirdest day of my life,\u201d Jimin says to no one in particular.</p>\n<p>\u201cThen it must be a good one, right?\u201d \u00a0Taehyung asks over his shoulder.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ll see,\u201d Jimin mutters as he leans back on the plush rug covering the floor of the van, closing his eyes, and enjoying the lightness in his body. Taehyung is beside him a minute later, plucking the joint from his fingers and shoving a plate into his lap.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe only utensils I own are sporks, so I hope you can manage.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin stares at him incredulously, brows furrowed. \u201cWe\u2019re eating sandwiches.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd?\u201d Taehyung asks as he delivers a spork-full of sandwich into his mouth.</p>\n<p>Jimin looks down at the spork on his plate and then back at Taehyung. \u201cHow the fuck do you usually eat sandwiches?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, I mean I know a spork isn't ideal, but you don\u2019t have to be a snob, damn dude,\u201d Taehyung murmurs with a mildly offended look before sporking off another bite of his sandwich. He chews cutely and Jimin suppresses the urge to smile. Instead, he too picks up his spork and follows suit.\u00a0\u201cSo where are you headed?\u201d Taehyung says with a mouth full of peanut butter and banana.</p>\n<p>\u201cA wedding. My best friend\u2019s wedding.\u201d</p>\n<p>Taehyung\u2019s chewing slows, and his eyes narrow as he appraises Jimin. \u201cOh?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUh, yeah. I\u2019m the best man. Or, one of the best men. I guess there are two at gay weddings?\u201d</p>\n<p>Taehyung\u2019s eyes widen almost comically, his cheeks bulging with food. \u201cAh. Gay. Gay wedding. Gay wedding tomorrow.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin bristles immediately. \u201cYes, gay, is that a problem?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh! No, I myself am what some might call homosexual but what is actually more in the realm of pan- never mind. Anyway, so, gay, you were talking about gay. Are you gay?\u201d he asks casually, then tries to swallow the massive amount of food in his mouth.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes\u2026\u201d Jimin replies suspiciously.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, cool, very cool.\u201d Taehyung says nonchalantly. \u201cSo do you have a date?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUnfortunately I think they\u2019re setting me up there.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat, you\u2019re not happy about that?\u201d Taehyung asks, brow creased.</p>\n<p>Jimin breathes deeply and leans back, picking up the joint from an ashtray and taking another drag. \u201cThe last guy they set me up with was a professional magician-slash-clown-slash-stripper. He pulled scarves out of some very unsettling places.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSounds like a free spirit.\u201d Taehyung raises his fist in solidarity. \u201cNot your type?\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin shakes his head. \u201cNot exactly.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWait!\u201d Taehyung says excitedly. \u201cLet me guess your type.\u201d He settles back on the floor, leaning on one elbow and facing Jimin. \u201cCorporate. Serious. Wears a watch. Pays his taxes. Thinks Big Bang Theory is funny.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh fuck off,\u201d Jimin says with a glare, but his voice lacks any true vitriol.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m right, aren\u2019t I?\u201d He stares at Jimin who says nothing but takes another swig of whiskey, face contorting slightly at the taste. \u00a0\u201cI bet I just described your last boyfriend.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d Jimin replies elusively.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo why didn\u2019t it work out?\u201d Taehyung asks as he takes the joint from between Jimin\u2019s fingers.</p>\n<p>Jimin considers. \u201cWe just stopped. Just fizzled, I guess.\u201d</p>\n<p>Taehyung takes a deep breath and flattens his elbow so that he can lay down level with Jimin. \u201cYou know, the thing about types is that they\u2019re bullshit. You date a certain type of person and it doesn\u2019t work out for a reason. So you wonder what\u2019s wrong every time things go bad, but you keep dating the same kinds of people anyway?\u201d Taehyung blinks slowly, eyes otherwise not leaving Jimin\u2019s face. \u201cBullshit.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell I\u2019m not dating a fucking clown stripper.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNever said you should,\u201d Taehyung says with a cocky smile.</p>\n<p>\u201cOk, if you know so much about me, then what kind of guy should I date?\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin turns his head to look over at him and does not miss the mischievous sparkle in his eyes as he replies, \u201cI think you\u2019d do well with a dashing writer. Somebody romantic enough to keep you happy, weird enough to keep you entertained, and hot enough to keep you interested. Fizzling would be a thing of the past.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin feels his heart rate accelerate and turns his head away again, staring instead at the ceiling. \u201cWell I\u2019ll have to keep my eyes peeled for a\u00a0<em>dashing\u00a0</em>writer then.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin can hear the indigence in Taehyung\u2019s voice as he pushes himself to his elbows. \u201cExcuse me, I am extremely dashing.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah?\u201d Jimin asks cockily. He smirks as he turns his head back towards Taehyung. \u201cOkay, well go ahead. Sell me on this dashing writer.\u201d</p>\n<p>\"Okay.\" Taehyung's appraising eyes fall heavy on him, mouth scrunching up to one side as he thinks. \u201cSo when you were with these corporate types, what did you do for fun?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI dunno,\u201d Jimin shrugs, \u201cWatched movies, went to dinner, went shopping. Normal things.\u201d</p>\n<p>Taehyung rubs his chin thoughtfully. \u201cYou know, you look like a suit on the outside, like you might be the kind of person who is really fulfilled by things like that. But I don\u2019t think that\u2019s who you are.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh really?\u201d Jimin says, trying to look casually amused, but he can feel his heart thundering against the inside of his chest. He\u2019s sure Taehyung can hear it, too.</p>\n<p>\u201cI mean hey, there's nothing wrong with suits. And sure, I\u2019m sure all that was nice, but people like you and me, we need more. We need things that feed the soul,\u201d he exclaims dramatically, pausing only to take another short drag from the joint. \u00a0\u201cYou need someone who hasn\u2019t already sold theirs for a corner office and a nice suit. Somebody who's always looking for new ways to tell you he loves you. Maybe he\u2019d feel sporadically artistic and try to make a sculpture of you from your used tissues which still bear the essence of you. Or drag you all around town taking pictures of you in all of his favorite spots so that he can see two of his favorite things at once. Maybe he\u2019d drive 100 miles to take you to the beach on a whim just because you said you missed the sun, or to the museum to show you a painting that reminded him of you. Maybe your anniversary dinner would be whiskey and banana sandwiches because that was the first meal you ever shared.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSounds exhausting,\u201d Jimin says with a dry laugh, but he can feel the heat radiating from his cheeks, especially at Taehyung's last comment.</p>\n<p>\u201cCan\u2019t be more exhausting than constantly pretending to be happy when you\u2019re not.\u201d</p>\n<p>They're quiet at that, Jimin enjoying the feeling of his mild high.</p>\n<p>\u201cHow was the sex?\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin splutters a little at that but manages a quick, \u201cIt was good.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNot great?\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin waves his hands about randomly and wildly. \u201cYes great, whatever!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sure it was.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2026But?\u201d Jimin sighs knowingly.</p>\n<p>\u201cNothing,\u201d Taehyung says with faux disinterest, looking away and busying himself by pouring another shot of whiskey into both of their cups.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh come on, what now?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHere, drink up,\u201d Taehyung says as if he hasn\u2019t heard him, passing him a cup. Jimin grabs it and swallows it down in one shot, now finding that he enjoys the accompanying burn.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat were you going to say?\u201d Jimin tries again. \u201cHow has the sex I\u2019ve been having been inferior to what you could offer?\u201d The alcohol has made him bold, and the words sound daring coming out of his mouth. He thinks he sees Taehyung\u2019s breath hitch, lips slightly parted, his tongue darting out nervously. Jimin tears his eyes away and tries not to think about what that tongue could do.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell it\u2019s not really something I could tell you. It\u2019s more something I\u2019d have to show you,\u201d Taehyung says, staring hard at Jimin, eyes a dare. \u00a0</p>\n<p>His heart is pounding hard in his throat. \u201cShow me, then.\u201d</p>\n<p>For a moment, it\u2019s quiet save for the whistling of the wind as it roars between the cars outside.</p>\n<p>\u201cHere?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not like you\u2019re gonna have another chance,\u201d Jimin almost whispers, trying to sound more confident than he feels.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s almost like he\u2019s flipped a switch, a confident smirk creeping onto Taehyung\u2019s face, eyes predatory as he subtly shifts his body closer. \u201cDon\u2019t say things you don\u2019t mean, Jiminnie,\u201d Taehyung warns him, voice low. His hand is warm as it creeps up Jimin\u2019s knee, up to his thigh where it rests, kneading the muscle there. \u201cDo you want me to show you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Jimin breathes as he feels Taehyung\u2019s hand burning through his clothes.</p>\n<p>Taehyung nods his head slowly, chewing on his bottom lip as his eyes bore into Jimin\u2019s. \u201cPants off.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin complies without hesitation, his only complaint being that Taehyung temporarily had to remove his hands from his thighs. He tosses his pants aside, subconsciously awaiting further instructions.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cNow the shirt,\u201d Taehyung orders, and Jimin shudders at the authority in his voice. Jimin pulls his shirt over his head, left only in his boxer-briefs, breaths coming hard as Taehyung reaches up to drag his hands down Jimin\u2019s torso. Halfway down, he starts to dig his nails into Jimin\u2019s flesh, grinning at the sharp intake of breath he receives in response. \u201cSuch a good boy.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat about you?\u201d Jimin asks shyly, gesturing to Taehyung\u2019s clothes.</p>\n<p>\u201cAll in good time, Jiminnie. Good sex is a process. And I want to make this good,\u201d He pulls Jimin on top of his lap, hands meandering down to squeeze his ass, and Jimin can feel himself growing hard against Taehyung\u2019s stomach. \u201cIt\u2019s all about knowing what your partner likes. What do you like?\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin flushes, mumbling as he averts his gaze, \u201cWhat do you mean what do I like?\u201d</p>\n<p>Taehyung chuckles. \u201cWhat do you like during sex?\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin feels vaguely mortified, like it\u2019s his first time all over again. \u201cJust... sex?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, this is going to be fun. Don\u2019t you worry, we\u2019ll find out exactly what you like.\u201d Taehyung leans forward to press open-mouthed kisses to Jimin\u2019s neck, sucking and biting until he hears a soft moan. \u201cAh, do you like that?\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin nods his head silently, eyes glued shut.</p>\n<p>\u201cGood, I like that, too. I like marking up pretty little things like you, leaving reminders for days after.\u201d As he\u2019s speaking, he reaches down to cup Jimin through his underwear, Jimin\u2019s head falling forward onto Taehyung's shoulder as he bites his lip to contain the noises that are threatening to spill out. Taehyung gently cradles his face, appraising him. \u201cAnd fuck, I really like the noises you make. I want to hear how good you feel.\u201d</p>\n<p>He leans forward and gently presses his lips to Jimin\u2019s, just the very tip of his tongue reaching out to flick at his upper lip. Jimin moans obediently into the kiss, lips moving languidly with Taehyung\u2019s. There\u2019s a building heat, a slow burn, an anticipation. He can feel Taehyung\u2019s erection pressing into his ass, and he rolls his hips down, enjoying the whoosh of air from Taehyung\u2019s lungs as he briefly breaks their kiss. His hands find Jimin\u2019s ass again, tightening his grip almost possessively.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d Taehyung asks, nuzzling his neck as his hands continue to kneed his ass.</p>\n<p>\u201cI want-\u201d Jimin tries to form a coherent thought. \u201cCan I\u2026\u201d he starts shyly, trailing off as he feels his face flush.</p>\n<p>\u201cCan you what? Talk to me,\u201d Taehyung urges.</p>\n<p>\u201cCan I taste you?\u201d</p>\n<p>Taehyung swallows hard, his confident mask wavering for just a second. \u201cFuck, Jimin.\u201d He gently kisses Jimin\u2019s nose and leans back so that the smaller boy is straddling his waist. Jimin runs his hands greedily down Taehyung\u2019s still-clothed chest, digging in his nails slightly and taking note of Taehyung\u2019s small gasp as he does so. With a pout, he tugs petulantly at Taehyung\u2019s shirt, grinning as the the man underneath him gives in and sheds the garment. Jimin knows he looks good like this, lips swollen, hair mussed, skin flushed, so he makes a show of it, arching his back as he gets on all fours to hover over Taehyung\u2019s body. He relishes the feeling of Taehyung pressing his body closer and closer as Jimin trails slow, open-mouthed kisses down his chest, pausing over a nipple to lick tauntingly. Taehyung growls lightly, and Jimin smirks against his skin before continuing lower, nipping gently at his hipbone.</p>\n<p>\u201cStop teasing,\u201d Taehyung commands, his brows knit.</p>\n<p>Jimin smirks as his hands deftly undo Taehyung\u2019s belt and zipper. Jimin tugs off his pants and underwear in one go, mouth watering as he looks down at Taehyung\u2019s smooth, thick thighs and leaking cock. \u00a0He takes Taehung\u2019s length in his hand, enjoying the heat and firmness of it, and licks a thick stripe from the base of Taehyung\u2019s cock up to the tip, lapping at a bead of precum that has gathered there. He hums contentedly. \u201cYou so taste good.\u201d</p>\n<p>Taehyung, who had been watching Jimin\u2019s performance with bated breath, lets his head fall back against the pillow with a groan. \u201cJesus fucking Christ.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin pauses and smirks up at him, clicking his tongue chidingly. \u201cLanguage. It\u2019s nearly Sunday, you scoundrel, the day of the Lord.\u201d</p>\n<p>Taehyung peeks down at him skeptically. \u201cSays the guy casually commenting on the taste of my- ah fuck Jimin!\u201d His head falls back meekly again as Jimin suddenly swallows him down, dragging his tongue along the underside of his cock, gagging slightly as it hits the back of his throat. Slowly, he drags his lips back up Taehyung\u2019s length before sinking his mouth down abruptly again. He doesn\u2019t gag this time, instead humming contentedly, taking pleasure in the rough, low moan that escapes Taehyung\u2019s throat.\u00a0 He works his mouth up and down, gently massaging Taehyung\u2019s balls with his free hand.\u00a0His jaw starts to ache and he feels himself getting sloppy, but a moment later, he hears Taehyung\u2019s voice say gently, \u201cHey.\u201d When he doesn\u2019t respond, Taehyung tries again. \u201cHey, hold on, I don\u2019t want to come yet.\u201d Feeling impish, Jimin takes Taehyung\u2019s cock especially deep, swallowing around it. \u201cHey!\u201d And then Taehyung\u2019s hand is tangled in his hair, dragging him up roughly so that their faces are level again. \u201cWhat happened to being good?\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin shrugs his shoulders, rolling his hips so that his still-clothed cock drags deliciously against Taehyung\u2019s. Taehyung reaches down, frustrated, as he pulls off Jimin's underwear, leaving them flesh to flesh. A heavy breath escapes Taehyung\u2019 lips as Jimin starts to move rhythmically on top of him, and something within Jimin itches to test the boundaries. He pulls back and deliberately slows the movements of his hips, and the frustration is clear on Taehyung\u2019s face, his hands urging Jimin to go faster. \u201cStop screwing around,\u201d he orders, his voice rough.</p>\n<p>Jimin, however, ignores him completely, smirking gleefully as he continues to move at a glacial pace.</p>\n<p>Finally, Taehyung loses it. \u201cHey! Park Jimin.\u201d And Taehyung surprises him by smacking him sharply on the ass. It stings a bit but sends a wave of pleasure shooting up Jimin\u2019s cock. He freezes, the moan caught in his throat. \u201cDo you want to be punished?\u201d Taehyung asks harshly.</p>\n<p>Jimin looks down at him and has the decency to flush, his face turning a pretty pink underneath a sheen of light sweat.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, you do?\u201d Taehyung asks, the smirk evident both on his face and in his voice. Jimin\u2019s eyes are big and unsure as he nods hesitantly. \u201cWell then.\u201d Taehyung grabs a handful of Jimin\u2019s ass and squeezes harshly before he draws back again and spanks him hard. Jimin moans shamelessly this time, grinding down against Taehyung as he does so. Taehyung rubs a soothing hand over the skin that is blooming red, emitting a throaty growl as his eyes travel across Jimin\u2019s body again.</p>\n<p>\u201cAgain,\u201d Jimin pleads.</p>\n<p>\u201cAgain, what?\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin flushes even redder. \u201cAgain, please.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAgain please, who?\u201d He squeezes Jimin\u2019s ass again as he asks, eyes trained carefully on his face as Jimin\u2019s eyes flutter closed.</p>\n<p>\u201cAgain please, Taehyung,\u201d Jimin breathes desperately.</p>\n<p>With a smirk, Taehyung complies, bringing his hand down hard against Jimin\u2019s blooming pink skin, the sharp sound mingling with Jimin\u2019s keen. \u201cNow are you ready to be good?\u201d Taehyung asks, moving his hand to gently stroke Jimin\u2019s cock. Jimin nods, biting his lip. Taehyung pulls him down so that their bodies are flat against each other and rolls them over so that he is now hovering over Jimin. \u201cGood.\u201d</p>\n<p>He works himself between Jimin\u2019s legs, peppering his chest with kisses as he rubs the palm of his hand over Jimin\u2019s hard, leaking tip. As Taehyung spreads the precum down his cock, Jimin thinks that he\u2019s never been this hard in his entire life. Taehyung\u2019s hand wanders down to massage his balls, pressing a tentative finger to the skin beneath them. Jimin groans and resists the urge to push his hips down.</p>\n<p>\u201cReady, baby?\u201d Taehyung asks as he nips at Jimin\u2019s hipbone, and lost in a daze of hot hands and mouths, Jimin doesn\u2019t even ponder his meaning before he\u2019s nodding his head compliantly. It\u2019s not until he feels a cold, wet finger pressing against his hole that he fully understands.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat the fuck?\u201d he yells, squirming his body away at the intrusion.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Taehyung asks, his eyes still glazed.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not- I don\u2019t... bottom.\u201d He feels like his face is on fire, and he mumbles the words more to the ground than to Taehyung.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell what the hell did you think I was going to do with my finger near your asshole?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI dunno,\u201d Jimin says sheepishly.</p>\n<p>Taehyung tilts his head to the side like a dog who\u2019s just heard a confusing sound. \u201cI just assumed\u2026 It seemed like\u2026\u201d He pushes himself to his elbows. \u201cDo you mean you\u00a0<em>don\u2019t\u00a0</em>bottom, or you just\u2026\u00a0<em>haven\u2019t</em> bottomed?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI just never\u2026 I always\u2026\u201d Jimin breaks off, embarrassed, rubbing the back of his neck nervously.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell how about this?\u201d Taehyung asks, scooting closer to Jimin. \u201cSince we\u2019re trying new things tonight, why don\u2019t we just try it, and if you still don\u2019t like it, you can fuck me. You say stop, I stop.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin eyes him skeptically.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll make you feel good, I promise.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin turns the idea over in his mind, cock throbbing a little when he thinks about Taehyung fucking him. Warily, he lowers himself back into a reclined position. \u201cOkay.\"</p>\n<p>\"Okay.\" Taehyung lips his licks, eyes hungry as he yanks Jimin\u2019s hips forward. \u201cJust relax, I\u2019m going to take good care of you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Taehyung\u2019s deep, reassuring voice does actually put him at relative ease as he feels the now slightly warmer finger circle around the rim of his hole. The slow press of the finger inside isn\u2019t as unpleasant as he thinks it\u2019s going to be.</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay?\u201d Taehyung asks as he stares down at Jimin\u2019s expression.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah. Fine. Weird, but okay.\u201d</p>\n<p>Taehyung pumps his finger a little to spread the lube around, his other hand working up and down on Jimin\u2019s length. A few minutes and another finger later, Jimin cringes a little, but the slide gradually gets easier.</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you want me to stop?\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin shakes his head, face flushed. \u201cNo, it\u2019s-\u201d He breaks off with a small moan. \u201cI think I like it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Taehyung leans down to kiss the smooth patch of skin above Jimin\u2019s hipbone. \u201cGood.\u201d</p>\n<p>Three fingers, and Jimin is rutting down against his hand. \u201cMore,\u201d Jimin whines. Taehyung doesn\u2019t need telling twice. He scrambles over to a small drawer in the makeshift kitchen, grabbing a condom and tearing it open before Jimin can even complain about his absence. \u201cHurry,\u201d Jimin insists, looking utterly debauched.</p>\n<p>Taehyung smacks the side of his ass as he adjusts the condom on his length. \u201cBe patient.\u201d The look on Jimin\u2019s face as Taehyung slowly slides inside of him has Taehyung groaning as he struggles to control himself. \u201cOkay?\u201d he asks, teeth gritted.</p>\n<p>\u201cGood, really fucking good,\u201d Jimin breathes, squirming. \u201cMove.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGive it a second,\u201d Taehyung warns him despite his every instinct to slam forward into Jimin\u2019s heat.</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t care, please just fuck me. Hard.\u201d</p>\n<p>Whatever semblance of control that Taehyung possesses dissolves at Jimin\u2019s words. He snaps his hips forward so hard that Jimin\u2019s entire body shifts up a few inches with the force, a broken, ragged groan leaving his mouth as Taehyung withdraws briefly and repeats the action. Taehyung\u2019s hands grip tight at Jimin\u2019s hips, pulling him down to meet the brutal thrusts.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy\u2026 did\u2026 I\u2026 never\u2026 try\u2026 this\u2026 before?\u201d Jimin manages to say, his words punctuated rhythmically in time to Taehyung\u2019s thrusts.</p>\n<p>\u201cFuck if I know,\u201d Taehyung says between harsh breaths. \u201cLook at you, you were born for it,\u201d he insists as Jimin clenches around him, and his face screws up in an effort not to come immediately. \u201cGod you\u2019re so sexy.\u201d Jimin positively keens at the praise, and Taehyung smiles. \u201cYou like that too? Do you like hearing what a good boy you are? How pretty you look when you\u2019re getting fucked?\u201d He reaches down and presses his thumb to Jimin\u2019s lips. \u201cHow good your lips looked wrapped around my cock?\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin can only whimper beneath him.\u00a0 With one final snap forward, Taehyung leans down, presses his lips to Jimin\u2019s and mutters, \u201cHands and knees.\u201d</p>\n<p>Taehyung pulls away to allow Jimin to get himself into position, ass in the air. Taehyung\u2019s hands come to rest reverently on his behind, rubbing gentle circles into the still-red skin. He brings his hand down hard, Jimin crying out as he drops to his elbows. \u201cPlease, Taehyung,\u201d he begs.</p>\n<p>Taehyung yanks Jimin\u2019s hips towards him and carefully pushes into him again, resting only a moment before he resumes his relentless pace. The fingertips of one hand dig hard into Jimin\u2019s hips, the other landing sharp, stinging blows on his ass. Jimin hears the pathetic whines and moans spilling from his own lips, feeling Taehyung\u2019s pace stutter occasionally now. Taehyung reaches around to jerk him off, and Jimin can feel his orgasm creeping up on him as Taehyung's skin continues to slap lewdly against his.</p>\n<p>\u201cGonna come,\u201d Jimin mutters, amending a second later, \u201cCan I come?\u201d</p>\n<p>A deep, rumbling moan from Taehyung sends a jolt of pleasure down his cock, but he manages to stave off his orgasm, waiting for permission. \u201cCome,\u201d Taehyung says huskily, hips unyielding but sloppy now. Jimin pitches forward as his orgasm sweeps over him. There is white behind his eyelids as he clenches around Taehyung, and he registers a hard bite on his shoulder, adding to the intensity of the sensation. Sweaty and twitching, he feels Taehyung slump lightly on top of him, realizing that he must have come too.</p>\n<p>They collapse onto the blankets, chests heaving as Taehyung peels off the condom and tosses it into a small trashcan.</p>\n<p>\u201cFuck,\u201d is all Taehyung can manage.</p>\n<p>\u201cFuck,\u201d Jimin concurs.</p>\n<p>They lay there for several minutes as their breathing returns to normal, listening to the howling wind.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo how\u2019s life on the bottom?\u201d Taehyung asks.</p>\n<p>\u201c...Fuck,\u201d Jimin repeats, hand coming up to muss his hair. They are quiet for several more moments before Jimin breaks the silence. \u201cWho\u00a0<em>are</em>\u00a0you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cKim Taehyung, author, sex god, part time bee-keeper, at your service.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s real anymore.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMy dick has that effect sometimes. You\u2019ll come back down to earth in a few hours.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin\u2019s subsequent glare falls flat as Taehyung beams like the sun and pulls him close.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The first thing that he notices when he opens his eyes is that the left half of his body is extremely warm while the right half is rather cold. He vaguely registers a comforting weight on top him, blinking the bleariness from his eyes and taking in the large expanse of smooth, golden skin pressed against his own.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s only after a minute that he recognizes the vibrating of his phone, the noise that woke him in the first place.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat the fuck-\u201d he asks no one in particular, groping for his phone among the many blankets. The weight on top of him shifts slightly, and he ignores the weight of a sleepy gaze heavy on his face.</p>\n<p>\u201cHello?\u201d he mumbles into his phone, clearing his throat when he hears his own voice raspy with sleep.</p>\n<p>\u201cDid you die?\u201d comes Yoongi\u2019s sleepy voice from the other end of the line.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, asshole.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh. Cool. Well it looks like they\u2019re nearly done clearing the roads, so I wanted to make sure you were awake.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin pulls the phone away from his ear and glances down at the clock on his phone. 4:00 am. \u00a0Ten hours since they\u2019d moved. Six hours until the wedding.</p>\n<p>\u201cTold you I\u2019d make it, hyung,\u201d Jimin says with a little smile.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah well you\u2019re not here yet.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTell Hobi I can\u2019t wait to see him.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yoongi makes a disgusted noise. \u201cI would, but he won\u2019t let me see or speak to him the day of. Says it\u2019s bad luck.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou guys are so fucking cute.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShut up. Just get your ass over here.\u201d</p>\n<p>The line goes silent, and Jimin chuckles lightly as he starts searching the van for his shirt.</p>\n<p>\u201cIn a hurry?\u201d a deep voice comes from beside him as he feels warm lips pressed up against his arm. He coughs awkwardly as he finally locates his shirt and shrugs it back on.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, my friend says they\u2019re getting things moving again. I should get back to my car.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you want some coffee or something? Or maybe a kinder, gentler wake-up?\u201d Taehyung asks slyly, hand sliding underneath the fluffy blanket. Jimin claps his hand on top of Taehyung\u2019s just as it creeps up to his thigh.</p>\n<p>\u201cUh, no. In fact, this all seems like a really terrible decision in the light of day.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not even light yet,\u201d Tahyung complains. \u201cHey, if nothing else, I\u2019m a great story. And a pretty good lay, I think. You are, too. \u00a0So we\u2019re all winners here, right?\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin feels his ears heat up, staring very hard at his shoelaces as he ties them. \u201cRight. Well,\u201d he says uncomfortably, \u201cIt was really nice\u2026 uh\u2026 meeting you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou too, Park Jimin,\u201d he says with a smile that is somehow both smug and kind.</p>\n<p>Jimin smiles a terse half-smile and reaches for the van door.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey,\u201d Taehyung calls after him, and his hand pauses on the door handle.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThis guy your friends are setting you up with\u2026 Just promise me you\u2019ll give him a chance today, yeah? Even if he\u2019s not exactly your type?\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin\u2019s smile is genuine this time. \u201cYeah, okay.\u201d With that, he pulls open the door and steps out into the cold. He turns his head, squinting far down the road and sees a couple of cars starting to shift forward slowly.</p>\n<p>Half an hour later, his car is inching forward along with the rest of them. At one point, he sees a blur of yellow from his left as the faster traffic moves quickly past his lane. Through the windows, he can see a hand waving wildly in his direction.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He arrives outside of Yoongi\u2019s house exhausted, letting out a great sigh and slumping over his wheel as he turns off the car.\u00a0 A body hits his parked car with a dull thud, his head snapping up towards the source of the noise.</p>\n<p>\u201cJiminnie!\u201d A tall man in an elegant coat stands peeking inside. Jimin sighs and pushes open the door enough to force the man to stumble backwards.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, at what point did you become older than me, you fucking brat?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI missed you,\u201d Jungkook grins widely before he adds, \u201cHyung.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMissed you too, Kook,\u201d he admits, a smile creeping onto his face despite himself. He allows himself to be pulled into a hug. \u201cIs Yoongi inside?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, he\u2019s just getting everything ready to head over to Jin\u2019s,\u201d Jungkook tells him as he starts to pull away, but suddenly he pauses, brow furrowed in confusion. He leans back in towards Jimin and takes several obvious sniffs.\u00a0\u201cWhy do you smell like sex?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Jimin scoffs.</p>\n<p>Jungkook\u2019s lip curls in disgust. \u201cDid you jerk it in your fucking car in the middle of an interstate?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cJesus ch- No, I did not.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut you definitely\u2026 Then why do you\u2026\u201d In just a second, his face morphs from horrified to elated. \u201cDid you get laid last night?\u201d</p>\n<p>The look of mortification on Jimin\u2019s face seems to be answer enough.</p>\n<p>\u201cHyuuuuung!\u201d Jungkook can hardly contain his joy, eyes shining. \u201cThat is literally amazing, how the hell did you manage to get laid. In the middle of a traffic jam. In a fucking blizzard? Teach me your ways!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cJungkook, I cannot handle this right now,\u201d he responds, massaging his temples with his fingers. \u201cLet\u2019s just focus on our best friends. Who are getting\u00a0<em>married</em>\u00a0today.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFine,\u201d Jungkook agrees with a small pout, leading him to Yoongi\u2019s front door. \u201cBut you have to tell me everything later.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yoongi greets him with a gummy smile and a gruff hug. \u201cThank God you\u2019re here. Namjoon already dropped one of my shoes in the toilet and lost the rings.\u201d Seeing Jimin\u2019s look of horror, he adds, \u201cWe found them, don\u2019t worry.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat can I do?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cJust go get ready and make sure you don\u2019t lose these.\u201d He presses a small box into Jimin\u2019s hands, then pauses for a moment. \u201cAlso, why do you smell like the gloryhole in a truckstop bathroom?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe got laid!\u201d Jungkook screams helpfully from the other room. Jimin feels like his face is engulfed in flames.</p>\n<p>Yoongi shakes his head, wiping the hand that had touched Jimin\u2019s back on his shirt. \u201cOh to be young again. Go take a shower, you sick bastard. I can\u2019t in good conscience let Hoseok set you up with his best friend when you\u2019re all jizzy like this.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin nods stiffly, pursing his lips as he stuffs the small box in his front pocket and heads down the hall towards the bathroom. He gently pulls the bathroom door closed behind him and turns on the shower, wearily pulling off his clothes and sniffing them gingerly.\u00a0 He cringes, then turns to the mirror, appraising his appearance. His neck and chest are littered with purple and red marks, and his lips look raw and swollen. No wonder they knew.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s just about to turn away when he spots something out of the corner of his eye, a small glimpse of black underneath his arm. Furrowing his eyebrows, he lifts his arm to reveal a messily scrawled phone number and a distorted smiley face in what appears to be permanent marker.</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you fucking kidding me?\u201d he asks himself as he cranes his head for a better view. \u201cWhen did he even-\u201d</p>\n<p>He tries his best to feel properly creeped out, but only a moment later, he\u2019s got his phone in his hand, awkwardly twisting his body to get a clearer view so he can punch the digits into his phone.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cSo are you going to tell me exactly how you managed to get laid mid-traffic jam?\u201d Yoongi asks him in the car.</p>\n<p>\u201cRight. So. I\u2019m trying to think of a way to say this that doesn\u2019t sound terrible. So\u2026 this guy invited me into his van\u2026 and we fucked.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2026Okay.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt sounds worse than it is, but like\u2026 I only used Shrimpy\u2019s pee bottle once.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand a word of that sentence but ew. What was the guy like?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe was\u2026\u201d But Jimin can\u2019t think of a way to properly summarize Taehyung in just a few words. \u201cWe ate sandwiches with sporks and he left his number on my armpit. I only found it like a second ago. And I think he said something about making a sculpture of me from my used tissues which still bore my essence?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWas he hot?\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin sighs heavily and throws his head back against the headrest of the car. \u201cSo hot.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo you\u2019re going to call him right?\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin draws back with a scowl. \u201cWhat? No.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy the hell not?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDid you miss that whole thing about sporks and tissues?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI dunno, you sounded kind of fond when you were talking about it. Had this wistful little smile and everything. It was gross.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFuck you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou saved his number didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2026Maybe.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, obviously you don\u2019t want to call him,\u201d Yoongi says with a roll of his eyes.</p>\n<p>Jimin clicks his tongue, arms crossed. \u201cCan we just focus on you right now? Aren\u2019t you getting married in like two hours?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, shit.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cJimin!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHey, hyung,\u201d Jimin says shyly as Jin pulls him in for a bone-crushing hug. He pulls Jimin inside the house, which is already buzzing with activity as caterers and florists rush to get everything set up.\u00a0 \u201cWow, it looks amazing!\u201d Jimin marvels as he takes it all in.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt really does,\u201d Yoongi agrees softly behind him. \u201cThanks again for letting us do it at your place, I don\u2019t know what we would have done\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>Jin cuts him off with a wave of his arms. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing, honestly. I\u2019m honored I can help.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIs Hoseok already here?\u201d Yoongi asks, looking around again.</p>\n<p>Jin chuckles. \u201cHe\u2019s already up in the guest room with his half of the wedding party. Insisted on being hidden away by the time you got here.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cRidiculous,\u201d Yoong mutters fondly.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou guys can get ready in my room. It\u2019s right next door to them, but as long as you can\u2019t see him, I think he\u2019ll be satisfied.\u201d</p>\n<p>Once they\u2019re in Jin\u2019s room, Yoongi puts his ear up against the wall and smiles when he hears low voices through the wall. \u201cLove you!\u201d he shouts through the drywall.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a moment of hushed silence right before a rapid banging reverberates through the wall and a deep voice from behind it yells \u201cNo contact!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCute,\u201d Yoongi chuckles as he turns to unzip the suit bags. \u201cI hope you know how to tie a bow tie because I have no fucking clue.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou think that I, your best man, would show up on your wedding day not knowing how to tie a bow tie?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cProbably.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin purses his lips and sighs. \u201cYeah, okay,\u201d he admits before yelling, \u201cJin-hyung?\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin is reclined on the bed, absentmindedly scrolling through his phone as Jin works on Yoongi\u2019s bow tie, when he finds himself staring at Taehyung\u2019s number.</p>\n<p>Suddenly, from behind his right shoulder, he hears, \u201cIs that him?\u201d</p>\n<p>He turns to see Jungkook behind him, perched on the bed. \u201cWhat? No.\u201d He moves to hide the phone, but Jungkook is too fast, snatching it from his hand before he has a chance. \u201cJungkook, give it back, I\u2019m not fucking around,\u201d he growls as he lunges to get it back.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo way, you should call him,\u201d Jungkook insists, crawling backwards on the bed and holding it out of his reach.</p>\n<p>\u201cBe careful, those suits are rentals,\u201d Jin says distractedly as he straightens Yoongi\u2019s bowtie.</p>\n<p>\u201cJeon Jungkook, I swear if you press that button I will kick the living shit out of you,\u201d Jimin warns as his movements get more desperate. Jungkook just gives him a stiffarm, attention still focused on the screen in front of him.</p>\n<p>\u201cHyung, I\u2019m doing you a favor.\u201d And to Jimin\u2019s horror, his phone screen flashes\u00a0<em>calling sporkboy</em>.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou fucking brat!\u201d he yells as he finally makes one great lunge forward and successfully grabs it. But a muffled noise makes him stop. \u201cShh!\u201d he insists, pressing a hand over a laughing Jungkook\u2019s mouth. \u201cIs that\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>Everyone in the room suddenly cranes their ears, and it seems like they can hear it too, through the wall.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u00a0<em>is\u00a0</em>that?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIs somebody having sex?\u201d Jin asks in disbelief.</p>\n<p>Jimin presses the end call button, and suddenly everything is silent.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo way. No fucking way,\u201d Jimin breathes as he launches himself off the bed, pressing the redial button and holding his ear up to the wall. And as it rings again, there\u2019s no way he doesn\u2019t recognize his own voice, moaning Taehyung\u2019s name through the wall.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo. Fucking. WAY,\u201d he repeats as he barrels through the door and barges into the room next door.</p>\n<p>Sure enough, there he is in all his purple-haired glory, digging desperately though his bag before pulling out his phone triumphantly. \u201cOh. Shit,\u201d Taehyung says as he looks up and catches a beet-red, fuming Jimin coming at him full-force.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou have just breathed your last breath you fucking bastard!\u201d Jimin knocks him down onto the bed, scrambling for the phone.</p>\n<p>Yoongi bounds in the room behind him, hand flung ridiculously over his eyes, and Hoseok makes a little noise of despair. \u201cNo, babe, I\u2019m not looking I swear, I just have to get Jimin,\u201d he insists as he blindly gropes for Jimin, tripping on a pair of shoes and falling on his face instead.</p>\n<p>A harried looking Jin appears behind him and bellows, \u201cTHOSE ARE FUCKING RENTALS,\u201d as Jimin begins choking Taehyung with his own tie. Jimin feels Jin\u2019s hands on his shoulders, gently trying to pry him away without rumpling the tux.</p>\n<p>Yoongi, still covering his eyes, has given up on restraining Jimin and is instead crawling one-handed towards Hoseok, who has broken down into dramatic tears, sobbing, \u201cIt\u2019s ruined, we\u2019re cursed!\u201d</p>\n<p>Jungkook remains in the doorway, clutching his side in laughter as he does his best to keep the camera steady.</p>\n<p>\u201cJEON JUNGKOOK GET OVER HERE AND HELP,\u201d Jin screams at him as he restrains Jimin\u2019s raised fist.</p>\n<p>Jungkook sighs before shutting off the camera. \u201cFine.\u201d</p>\n<p>Between the two of them, they manage to contain Jimin, dragging him bodily from the room as he digs in his heels and shouts, \u201cYOU HAVENT SEEN THE LAST OF ME, YOU FUCKER.\u201d</p>\n<p>A second later, Namjoon shuffles up to the door, snacking on something he\u2019s obviously snagged from the caterer and looking completely oblivious. \u201cWhat did I miss?\u201d Yoongi uncovers his eyes long enough to glare at him, then shuts them again and turns his attention back to Hoseok.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat the hell was that?\u201d Jin asks as he shoves Jimin back into his room.</p>\n<p>Jimin fumes silently, arms crossed, breathing still heavy. Yoongi appears at the door and strides up to him, grabbing his collar. \u201cYou asshole, Hoseok is crying. Convinced we\u2019re doomed for a divorce now.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSorry,\u201d Jimin says shortly, eyes flitting guiltily upwards to Yoongi\u2019s face.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou gonna tell us what that was all about?\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin pouts. \u201cIt\u2019s embarrassing. Make Jungkook leave.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Jungkook shouts in outrage as Jin ushers him out the door and shuts it behind him. \u201cHey, not fair!\u201d comes his muffled voice through the door. A suspicious bumping tells them that he\u2019s got his ear pressed to the wood outside.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo?\u201d Jin asks expectantly.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou know how last night I got laid on the interstate in the back of a van?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFirst of all, ew, I did not know that but thank you for sharing, Jimin,\u201d Jin says with a disgust expression.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell I did. Told the guy I was on my way to a wedding in the city. That I was the gay best man at the gay wedding. I mean really what are the odds he didn\u2019t know, how many fucking gay weddings are there in this city every day?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOk, so?\u201d Jin prompts.</p>\n<p>\u201cJungkook just called the guy from last night.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd?\u201d Yoongi asks obliviously.</p>\n<p>\u201cI just heard the phone ringing next door.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh. And that sound we heard through the wall was...?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2026Us, last night,\u201d Jimin mutters, his face aflame. \u201cRingtone.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWait wait wait,\u201d Yoongi says, massaging his forehead with his fingers. \u201cTaehyung is van guy?\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin nods morosely.</p>\n<p>Yoongi bursts out laughing. \u201cOh my God, I should have fucking known, of course it was Taehyung.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHyung,\u201d Jimin pouts, \u201cThis isn\u2019t funny.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cJimin I\u2019m sorry but this is goddamn hilarious. You know Taehyung was the one Hoseok was going to set you up with, right? Hoseok even showed him your picture. He totally knew it was you.\u201d\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2026 what?\u201d Jimin throws himself back onto the bed and groans, thinking back to last night. \u201cOk now a lot of things make sense. He used my surname. I never told him my surname, and he knew my surname. I feel so dumb,\" he groans, beating his fists against his forehead. \" Hey, what the hell? Why didn\u2019t you show me his picture?\u201d Jimin demands.</p>\n<p>\u201cTae was on this thing for a while where he thought each photograph stole a little bit of his soul, so pictures of him were hard to come by.\u201d Jimin\u2019s groan borders on a sob. \u201cAw hey buddy, don\u2019t be too mad. Knowing Taehyung, he probably thought this would be romantic or some shit, not totally deceptive and embarrassing.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI just want to die a little,\u201d Jimin whines, pressing a pillow over his head as if to smother himself.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell you can die later,\u201d Yoongi says, slapping the side of Jimin\u2019s bruised ass. Jimin winces. \u201cBut first, I need to get married. And I need you to promise me that you\u2019re not going to attack Hoseok\u2019s best man and almost ruin the wedding. Again.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHyuuuuuuung.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNope, sit your ass up and pinky promise.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin grumbles as he pushes himself into a seated position and extends a grudging pinky finger. \u201cFine. But only because I love you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHey guys,\u201d Jungkook yells through the door, \u201cSporkboy is out here and he wants to come inside.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDo not,\u201d Jimin says in a low, warning voice as Yoongi starts to back away with a wicked smile. \u201cDo not leave me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, okay Jungkook, we\u2019re coming out,\u201d Yoongi says, as he makes for the door.</p>\n<p>\u201cJin-hyung\u2026. please,\u201d Jimin begs. \u201cI beg you.\u201d</p>\n<p>With an apologetic smile, Jin allows himself to be dragged behind Yoongi. \u00a0\u201cI\u2019ll be right outside,\u201d he reassures him.\u00a0Jimin tries not to panic as the two older boys exit the room, Yoongi laughing lightly at Taehyung and patting his shoulder as he enters. The door shuts ominously behind him.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo...\u201d Taehyung starts, a nervous smile plastered on his face as he appraises Jimin\u2019s scowling countenance. \u201cWe meet again.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you fucking kidding me?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry!\u201d Taehyung exclaims, \u201cI\u2019d planned on spitting some smooth line about fate bringing us together again... Like, remember the last thing I told you was, hey, give the blind date a chance right? So I thought it\u2019d be like super charming if you just showed up and that guy was me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell wow, I am just charmed off my ass,\u201d Jimin says dryly.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Taehyung repeats, head hanging a little.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd what the fuck dude, what\u2019s with the ringtone?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d Taehyung says sheepishly, face coloring as he rubs the back of his neck anxiously. \u201cUh, my butt accidentally recorded it on my phone in the midst of things last night, and I just, I just really liked the way you sounded\u2026 \u00a0And I swear, I meant to put it on silent, and then it just kept ringing and I couldn\u2019t find it in my bag and\u2026 I\u2019m\u00a0<em>so\u00a0</em>sorry.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cJesus Christ,\u201d Jimin mumbles, massaging his forehead.</p>\n<p>Taehyung stands there, head hung in apology. \u201cDid I mention how sorry I was?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOnce or twice.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo,\u201d Jimin huffs, \u201cWe can talk later. Let\u2019s just go out there and be good best men. Or at least, better best men. We\u2019re fucking awful.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It\u2019s weird standing across from Taehyung as two of his best friends get married. At one point, their eyes meet from opposite sides of the aisle, and Taehyung shoots him an uncharacteristically shy smile before dropping his eyes to his feet then turning back to the grooms. \u00a0Despite all his efforts to remain stony faced, he can\u2019t stop the small smile that creeps onto his face in response. \u00a0</p>\n<p>And if Taehyung had looked beautiful, disheveled and sandaled in the back of a gross yellow van, that was nothing compared to the way he looks in a tuxedo, pastel hair swept back, eyes sparkling and adoring as Yoongi and Hoseok seal their union with a kiss. Jimin swipes at his own eyes as his gaze flickers back and forth between the happy couple and Taehyung.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He\u2019s in the midst of chugging a much-needed beer when Hoseok approaches him with a wary Taehyung in tow.</p>\n<p>\u201cNow Jimin I\u2019m going to pretend that I don\u2019t know that you fucked my best friend in a dirty van in the middle of an interstate last night and instead I\u2019m just going to introduce you to this great guy that I think you\u2019re really going to like.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cExcuse me, my van is not dirty,\u201d Taehyung pipes in from behind him.</p>\n<p>Hoseok continues like he didn\u2019t hear him. \u201cSo Park Jimin, please meet my very good friend, Kim Taehyung. He\u2019s 24, an author, and in a very short time he will not be living in a van.\u201d He tugs Taehyung lightly forward and forces him to extend a hand, which Jimin reluctantly takes. \u201cTaehyung, this is Park Jimin, 25, accountant. Pays his taxes-\u201c</p>\n<p>Taehyung makes a noise of disgust</p>\n<p>\u201c- but he\u2019s got the flexibility of a Russian gymnast and the tongue of Gene Simmons.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI am aware,\u201d Taehyung smirks. Hoseok glares hard at him, looking completely repulsed. \u201cSorry,\u201d Taehyung recovers, \u201cIt\u2019s very nice to meet you Jimin.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to play this game,\u201d Jimin says tiredly.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhatever, do what you want,\" Hoseok pouts, \"I\u2019m going to go whine to my husband about what assholes you guys are. I can\u2019t believe you fucked this up.\u201d Taehyung opens his mouth as if to respond, and Hoseok shushes him before retreating into the small crowd.</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you still really angry?\u201d Taehyung asks quietly.</p>\n<p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t say\u00a0<em>angry</em>\u00a0exactly-\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOk, good, because like my van is right outside, so we should go give those shocks another test run, if you know what I me-\u201c At the look on Jimin\u2019s face, he stops. \u201cJust kidding.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin raises his eyebrows. \u201cWere you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, of course. Unless\u2026 you\u2026\u201d He scans Jimin\u2019s face for a moment before continuing. \u201cYep, definitely kidding.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI knew this setup was going to be a disaster.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh come on, it wasn\u2019t a disaster.\u201d He smiles falters slightly under Jimin\u2019s withering glare. \u201cOk, it was a\u00a0<em>near</em>-disaster, but look, lots of other great things happened too. For instance, you got some great dating advice and a kickass sandwich. Also, we both got hot wedding dates.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou are not my date.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes I am, Hoseok said I was. His wedding, his rules.\u201d He pauses for a moment, scratching his chin. \u201cLet\u2019s see, what other good things came from this? Oh! We also had mind-blowing semi-public sex, oh and you learned you like it up the butt,\u201d he says rather too loudly as an old woman passes by, looking scandalized.</p>\n<p>\u201cI regret everything,\u201d Jimin says solemnly, draining the rest of his beer.</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you really?\u201d Taehyung asks, and Jimin feels a little guilty when he looks up from the bottle in his hands and catches a glimpse of Taehyung\u2019s crestfallen expression.</p>\n<p>\u201cI mean\u2026 I guess not everything,\u201d Jimin mumbles quietly.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell I don\u2019t regret anything,\" Taehyung proclaims proudly, and Jimin shoots him a deadly glare. \"...I mean, besides deceiving and publicly embarrassing you. Obviously,\" he recovers. \"What I mean is, I actually really like you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin's heart dances a little at his words, but he tries his best to keep his face slightly grumpy. \u201cYou do?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s not to like? You\u2019re a catch. Hoseok was right. He told me so many great things, and I haven\u2019t once been disappointed with the real deal.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin\u2019s absentmindedly circles his finger around the rim of his bottle for several seconds as he stares out at the lively room around him. \u201cI can\u2019t tell if I like you or hate you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI could work with either. Both, even.\u201d Taehyung takes a deep breath through his nose. \u201cLook, I know I really fucked up. And I wish I could say I\u2019d never fuck up again, but I\u2019m me, so I know I would. All I can say for sure is that whatever I\u2019d do, I\u2019d do it because I liked you.\u201d Jimin just nods his head slowly, eyes trained on the floor, so Taehyung continues. \u201cIs there any chance?\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin finally sets down his bottle on the table behind him and looks up at Taehyung. \u201cMaybe.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cReally?\u201d Taehyung asks excitedly.</p>\n<p>\u201cCalm down, a maybe is not a yes,\u201d Jimin cringes. \u201cI need some time to process this fucking day.\u201d He considers for a moment. \u201cHey, where will you even be? Aren\u2019t you giving up the van life soon?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, I\u2019ll be around,\u201d Taehyung says cryptically, smirking ridiculously.</p>\n<p>\u201cStop that or I\u2019m leaving right now forever.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u201cHave you heard from sporkboy?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe were talking for a while, but he's been suspiciously quiet lately,\u201d Jimin says, readjusting the phone between his cheek and shoulder as he does the dishes. \u201cI think he\u2019s planning something.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s not good. That\u2019s never good,\u201d Yoongi warns.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to tell me.\u201d A soft beeping on the line tells him that another call is coming in, and he sighs when he sees the name on the screen. \u201cDamn. Speak of the devil and he shall appear.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s calling?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019ll call you back later. Tell your husband I say hey.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWill do.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin tries to calm his racing heart as he presses the \u201caccept\u201d button on his phone. \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d He tries to sound as annoyed as possible.</p>\n<p>\u201cLovely to hear your voice, too.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d Jimin repeats in a softer tone.</p>\n<p>\u201cI had Hoseok send a copy of my book to your house. Go check your porch.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin wipes his hands on a dish towel and heads to his front door. \u201cWhy am I concerned?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy are you so suspicious? Can\u2019t I just do something nice?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t know\u2026\u201d Jimin replies as he cautiously opens his front door and peeks out. \u201cCan you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes.\u201d His voice is pouty and defensive.</p>\n<p>Jimin opens the door the rest of the way and looks down. A book. \u201cIt\u2019s really just a book.\u201d He is dismayed to find that he actually sounds a little disappointed.</p>\n<p>\u201cI told you. See, I can chill.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jimin picks it up and leafs through it. \u201cActually this is kind of cool. I guess you were-\u201d He breaks off as he catches a glimpse of bright yellow on the other side of his bushes. \u201cKim Taehyung. Are you at my fucking house?\u201d</p>\n<p>There is silence on the other end, then all of a sudden, an engine roars to life nearby. \u201cNo, I am not.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou are! You are at my fucking house. How did you even know where I live?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not here! I mean THERE, I\u2019m not THERE,\u201d he insists as the van shoots forward a couple of feet.</p>\n<p>\u201cHold on!\u201d Jimin says despite himself, smacking himself in the forehead, and the van comes to a screeching halt. \u201cUm. Don\u2019t go yet. I guess.\u201d</p>\n<p>The engine dies immediately. \u201cReally?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2026.Yes really.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Really</em>\u00a0really?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m about to change my mind.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo! Sorry, one second, I\u2019ll be right in.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWait,\u201d he pauses, and he can almost feel Taehyung holding his breath on the other end of the line. \u201dDon't come to me. I\u2019ll come to you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>"
