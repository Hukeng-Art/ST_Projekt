  "text": "<p>\u201cFuck you, Wen-dog. I\u2019ll come back a vicious ghost. You\u2019ll never be rid of me, so go ahead, kill me if you dare.\u201d</p>\n<p>He\u2019s laughing, but the ringing in his ears is louder than his voice that sounds far away like the silver draw of metal swords. Wen Chao\u2019s mouth opens and shuts, cursing him, but he can\u2019t make out the actual words. It\u2019s like he\u2019s lying in a coffin filled with the thump of his own heartbeat, and he\u2019s looking through cracks in the thick wood at the red sun. Blood pools on the ground beneath him where it\u2019s dripping from his mouth, the white-and-red boots draw back and dig harder into his ribs, wringing gasping, wet coughs out of him. His own fingers clench into a fist, pushing as hard as he can to let the energy of his golden core flow through\u2014but it\u2019s not there, it doesn\u2019t work, it\u2019s like trying to push air.</p>\n<p>Someone pulls at him, and the world tilts. He smells the sandalwood, sees the light golden eyes before he recognizes him. Lan Wangji hauls him up with one hand. With the other, he makes a rough motion with his sword, and a splatter of blood splits across his expressionless face.</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji pushes him, thrusts a sword in his hand\u2014go, <em> go </em>\u2014and when he doesn\u2019t go, Lan Wangji drags him up. The wind his hair against his face as Lan Wangji hauls him onto Bichen with him, his own sword dangling useless from his hand. He thinks it\u2019s funny that not too long ago, Lan Wangji had refused to touch so much as his hand, and now he\u2019s being held close with one arm, the other throwing talisman spell after talisman spell behind them.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian wakes twice. The first time, he panics, pushing at the arm around him until a body-locking spell wraps around his limbs and he\u2019s forced to go limp.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re safe.\u201d He feels the rumble of the voice and realizes he can smell sandalwood even in the wind rushing by them. His eyes close.</p>\n<p>The second time, he\u2019s in a dark room, and he\u2019s being forced to sit up, and a bowl of bitter medicine is being pushed against his lips.</p>\n<p>He tries to push it away, but the bowl is pressed more insistently to his mouth.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s medicine. Drink.\u201d</p>\n<p>A hand forces his chin up and open, and the person pours the medicine down his throat until the bowl is empty.</p>\n<p>He sputters, but he\u2019s finally allowed to lay back down and sleep.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The third time he wakes, the sun is shining down between slivered gaps in the thin thatch roofing overhead.</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian winces and sits up. He\u2019s lying on a pile of hay, two robes covering him. The first is his own, torn and heavy with an iron stench. The second is the white of the GusuLan Sect. When he sat up, it had slid down to his lap, and it\u2019s the first time he\u2019s seen the white robe stained with brown flecks of dried blood.</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji looks over from where he stands guard at the doorway of the stable they\u2019re in, his outer robe gone.</p>\n<p>\u201cLan Wangji...why are you here?\u201d Wei Wuxian asks. His voice is scratchy, and his throat dry like so much yellow hay had been stuffed down it.</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji bends to pick up something outside. When he brings it back, Wei Wuxian instantly recognizes the bitter smell of medicine coming from the small, earthenware pot.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo thanks,\u201d Wei Wuxian says, wrinkling his nose.</p>\n<p>\u201cDrink,\u201d Lan Wangji says and holds the steaming bowl up to Wei Wuxian\u2019s lips.</p>\n<p>\u201cAll right, fine, I\u2019ll drink it myself,\u201d Wei Wuxian says. His hands shake. He downs it all at once, swallowing once, twice, three times, and then takes a deep, gasping breath when the bowl is empty. He can still taste the bitterness on his tongue, but he feels warmer after having had it. \u201cHow long\u2026\u201d he asks.</p>\n<p>\u201cOne day,\u201d Lan Wangji says. He\u2019s turned to look outside again. \u201cWe are not far from Yiling yet.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian looks down at the stained white robe clutched in his cut-up hands. \u201cYou can leave,\u201d he says. It comes out a weak croak and he tries again. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to stay with me. I\u2019m the one wanted by the Wen Sect.\u201d He smiles, small and resigned. \u201cThe worst they can do is torture and kill me, and then I can come back a vengeful ghost and\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji crosses the room in two broad steps and catches him by the wrist. He lifts it, pressing his thumb into the pulse. Wei Wuxian snatches his hand away, eyes wide.</p>\n<p>\u201cWen ZhuLiu,\u201d Lan Wangji says, staring at Wei Wuxian\u2019s wrist, then his chest, then his sword lying an arms length away on the ground. \u201cYour golden core.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t him,\u201d Wei Wuxian says, holding his wrist close to himself and looking away. \u201cI asked Wen Qing to take it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI asked her to give mine to Jiang Cheng,\u201d Wei Wuxian snaps. \u201cHe\u2019s the only\u2014he\u2019s the YunMengJiang Sect leader now.\u201d He\u2019d promised to protect Jiang Cheng with his life, and on his watch, Jiang Cheng had lost his golden core.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy did you do such a rash thing?\u201d Lan Wangji grabs him by the shoulders and lifts him until he\u2019s half-kneeling. \u201cWei Wuxian, you\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy do you care?\u201d Wei Wuxian says, refusing to look at him. \u201cIt has nothing to do with outsiders.\u201d</p>\n<p>The hands tighten around him and it hurts. \u201cIt has to do with me,\u201d Lan Wangji says.</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian laughs, a dry hacking laugh. \u201cNever thought I\u2019d hear those words come out of your mouth, Hanguang-Jun.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt has to do with me,\u201d Lan Wangji repeats slow, pronouncing every word. His eyes bore into him. Lan Wangji lets go of him, and he slides back to the ground.</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji turns. \u201cGet dressed. We keep moving.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian slowly pulls on his grimey outer robe and straps his now useless sword to his waist. He holds Lan Wangji\u2019s white robe, hesitating, but Lan Wangji doesn\u2019t turn around again. Finally, he drapes it over his own shoulders and gets up, wearing it as a second robe. He\u2019s not sure if it\u2019s his missing core or the injuries and blood loss or just the late spring chill that\u2019s making his fingers cold and numb and shaky.</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji glances at him, but doesn\u2019t comment on the robe. \u201cGet on my back,\u201d he says.</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian loops his arms around his neck, and lets Lan Wangji hoist him up. It\u2019s less cold this time, with Lan Wangji\u2019s entire front shielding him from the wind. Wei Wuxian breathes in the smell of sandalwood, and closes his eyes.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>It\u2019s dark again when Wei Wuxian feels Bichen wobble. It\u2019s only for a moment, but enough that he knows something is wrong. It\u2019s been at least forty-some hours since Lan Wangji had any rest, on top of fighting and flying and carrying Wei Wuxian all this time. Even Hanguang-Jun must have a limit.</p>\n<p>\u201cLan Zhan,\u201d Wei Wuxian says. It\u2019s so cold flying now that his cheeks have gone numb. \u201cWe should rest for the night. You should rest.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not safe yet.\u201d Lan Wangji pauses between words. Pressed up against him, Wei Wuxian can feel his labored breathing.</p>\n<p>They fly for another thirty minutes before the sword tilts again. This time, it almost throws Wei Wuxian off his back.</p>\n<p>Finally, Lan Wangji begins bringing them down. He aims for a copse of trees by a silver stream, nothing but a smudge of dark shadows in the black night. He puts Wei Wuxian down, careful, and pulls a small pouch out from his robes. He empties it of the herbs inside\u2014only a handful left. Half, he puts back in the pouch, and the other half into the clay pot Wei Wuxian used earlier that day.</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji cuts down a handful of branches from the nearby trees with his sword, and lights the green wood with a talisman. It\u2019s too smoky and doesn\u2019t burn well, but he begins brewing medicine.</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian turns away from the smoke and his eyes follow Lan Wangji. He sets the little clay pot on the fire. Every once in awhile, his eyes flash gold at the fire and the flames flare up with the gust of wind accompanying the spell.</p>\n<p>When the flame dies down again, beads of sweat are staining the ribbon tied on Lan Wangji\u2019s forehead. The night is cold, and the fire is small. Wei Wuxian, even wrapped in two robes, is shivering.</p>\n<p>Only when Lan Wangji moves to pick up the pot does Wei Wuxian notice his movements favor his right side.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re hurt,\u201d Wei Wuxian says.</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji\u2019s steps slow. \u201cI\u2019m not,\u201d he says.</p>\n<p>\u201cOn your left side,\u201d Wei Wuxian says. \u201cLet me see.\u201d</p>\n<p>When Lan Wangji doesn\u2019t move, Wei Wuxian gets to his feet, bones aching with the movement, and goes to him. He pulls Lan Wangji\u2019s robe aside. Underneath, Lan Wangji\u2019s undergarment is stained red and sticks to his skin.</p>\n<p>\u201cLan Zhan, you\u2014\u201d Wei Wuxian\u2019s eyes widen. He loosens the ties on the robe entirely and peels aside both shirt and undergarment. A large gash is revealed, crusted and scabbing but so large and deep that it\u2019s still oozing red. \u201cWhen did you\u2014when did this happen?\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji grunts.</p>\n<p>\u201cWas it when you came for me?\u201d Wei Wuxian demands. \u201cYou idiot! This\u2014this is really bad. You need a doctor.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI can suppress it,\u201d Lan Wangji says. He must have been using his golden core to keep the wound closed, but going without sleep and using his qi and strength to fly them both had finally taken a toll\u2014his control had loosened so that the wound had begun bleeding again. With the amount of discipline Lan Wangji has, he would never let that happen unless he couldn\u2019t help it.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou can\u2019t keep this up.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan WanJi picks up the clay pot but Wei Wuxian shakes his head when Lan Wangji tries to give it to him.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou need it more than I do,\u201d Wei Wuxian says.</p>\n<p>Lan WanJi shakes his head. \u201cNo.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThen we\u2019ll share,\u201d Wei Wuxian says.</p>\n<p>\u201cOnly enough for one,\u201d Lan Wangji says.</p>\n<p>\u201cThen brew two, Lan Zhan\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>Even with his wound, Lan WanJi is fast\u2014too fast for Wei Wuxian to stop when he hits his pressure points, immobilizing him, but catches him before he collapses to the ground. He props Wei Wuxian up against a tree and brings the medicine to his lips, pushing his chin open and pouring in the medicine.</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian tries to protest, but it only results in sputtering and gagging, and in the end, it\u2019s easier to drink than to spit it out.</p>\n<p>Once he\u2019s finished, Lan Wangji nods and rinses the pot in the stream.</p>\n<p>\u201cLan Zhan, the rest of the medicine\u2014put it on your wound,\u201d Wei Wuxian says. He finds the body lock has been undone once he finished the medicine, and he\u2019s able to move again.</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji shakes his head. \u201cFor you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat if it gets worse?\u201d Wei Wuxian demands.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt won\u2019t,\u201d Lan Wangji says. But Wei Wuxian can see the tiny tremble in his hand, the bead of sweat that has dripped down his jaw.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou know I\u2019ve never met anyone as stubborn as you. At least rest then,\u201d Wei Wuxian says. \u201cI\u2019ll take first watch.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji hesitates.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019ve skipped your curfew twice now,\u201d Wei Wuxian says. \u201cGo on. Sleep. I\u2019m used to sleeping late anyway.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cJust a few hours,\u201d Lan Wangji says finally.</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian nods. He\u2019ll agree to anything if it will get Lan Wangji to rest. Lan Wangji sits against the tree and shuts his eyes. His breathing evens out a moment later.</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian waits until he\u2019s sure Lan Wangji is asleep, and drapes both outer robes over him as gently as he can. Lan Wangji frowns in his sleep but doesn\u2019t wake.</p>\n<p>That night, Wei Wuxian breaks out into a shivering fever.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>They travel the same way the next day. Lan Wangji flies them both on his sword, going slow because he must keep away from main roads but not so high that they\u2019d be easily spotted from a distance. At nightfall, they land by another stream and Lan Wangji brews medicine and forces Wei Wuxian up to drink it. He\u2019s too tired and miserable to protest.</p>\n<p>Between fevered dreams of Lotus Pier burning, the sound of Jiang Cheng\u2019s voice breaking as he cries, the empty ache in his chest, the shivers that wrack his body so hard sometimes that he can just barely hang onto Lan Wangji, Wei Wuxian loses track of time.</p>\n<p>On the third day, Lan Wangji lands while the sun is still high in the sky. When Wei Wuxian blinks his eyes open, he can see the hazy outline of a town up ahead.</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji\u2019s face is so close that Wei Wuxian can see the flecks of gold in his pale eyes. Wei Wuxian\u2019s fever has broken him into shivers again and he can\u2019t seem to feel warm enough though it\u2019s nearly summer. Even though Lan Wangji looks like he\u2019s been carved from a block of pale jade, his body is warm and Wei Wuxian wants to get closer.</p>\n<p>\u201cStay here,\u201d Lan Wangji says, propping him up in the lee of a boulder so wind is no longer blowing against him. He pulls his robe more securely around Wei Wuxian\u2019s shoulders.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d Wei Wuxian murmurs.</p>\n<p>\u201cOut of medicine,\u201d Lan Wangji says. The tiniest frown mars his expressionless face. Wei Wuxian wants to tease him about it, but he can\u2019t summon the energy. \u201cI\u2019ll come back soon. Do not move.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Wei Wuxian says. He doesn\u2019t think he could move even if he wanted to.</p>\n<p>He drifts in and out of sleep, waiting for Lan Wangji. Sometime after the sun has creeped down on the horizon and dyed the sky red, he hears the sound of footsteps and voices.</p>\n<p>He thinks, at first, that Lan Wangji has come back, so he just waits. His inaction saves him from discovery.</p>\n<p>\u201cI heard the Wen Sect caught the eldest YunMengJiang disciple\u2014the one they adopted, what was his name?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWei WuQian, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d a second voice says.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s a pair of young men traveling together with a donkey and a cart. From where Wei Wuxian is huddled, he can hear the crunch of pebbles beneath their boots, the snorts of the donkey, the creaking wood of the cart as it moves along. They\u2019re traveling slow, transporting some goods or other to the town Lan Wangji is in.</p>\n<p>\u201cRight right, Wei WuQian,\u201d the first voice says. \u201cSo there\u2019s only two left\u2014Jiang WanYin and the sister. It won\u2019t be long before that clan is wiped out by the sun.\u201d He sighs.</p>\n<p>\u201cBut I heard the Wen Sect didn\u2019t catch Wei WuQian,\u201d the second voice says. \u201cMy cousin heard from her friend who was there in Yiling where they found him\u2014Hanguang-Jun\u2014one of those Two Jades of Lan came and fought them off. He\u2019s on their blacklist now too.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSomeone from the GusuLan? I thought the other sects were keeping clear of the YunMengJiang Sect.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDidn\u2019t you see the wanted posters? Pay attention to them when we get to Bai Town,\u201d the second voice says. \u201cWei WuQian\u2019s is still up, and so is this Lan Wangji. All I know is, if we see them, there\u2019ll be a big reward.\u201d</p>\n<p>The first voice laughs. \u201cAs though we\u2019d be so lucky! If Hanguang-Jun really did save Wei WuQian, they must be far away by now.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know that,\u201d the second voice whines. \u201cWe could use the money. My mother has been sick, and there hasn\u2019t been much rain. It looks like it\u2019ll be a hot summer at this rate, and medicine prices are already skyhigh.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, yeah, we can visit the temple and pray for luck,\u201d the first voice says. \u201cWhile you\u2019re at it, pray for better looks too. I heard Meimei rejected you <em> again </em>. Aren\u2019t you embarrassed to keep proposing by now?\u201d</p>\n<p>Once they\u2019ve left earshot, Wei Wuxian stumbles to his feet. His limbs feel achey and weak, and he has to lean on the boulder to stop his head from spinning. If people know about them, if there are wanted posters up\u2014the GusuLan uniform is unmistakable, and a man as beautiful as Lan Wangji attracts attention to begin with. It won\u2019t be long before he\u2019s discovered.</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian walks slow, wincing as he stumbles toward the town. He hasn\u2019t gotten even halfway there yet, when he hears a shout.</p>\n<p>\u201cWei Ying!\u201d</p>\n<p>He turns and sees Lan Wangji running toward him from the direction of the boulder. He doesn\u2019t think he\u2019s ever seen Lan Wangji run like this\u2014inelegant, robes in disarray. Then he\u2019s right there and Wei Wuxian is being swept up and held so close that he can feel the rapid thump of his heartbeat.</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian manages a weak laugh. \u201cIsn\u2019t running against your GusuLan rules?\u201d he says.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou weren\u2019t there,\u201d Lan Wangji says after a moment. \u201cAt the boulder. I thought\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>Oh.</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian hesitantly puts his arms around Lan Wangji. \u201cI heard some farmers going to town. They said you were wanted by the Wen Sect too now. For helping me,\u201d he says. \u201cI wanted to warn you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWarn me,\u201d Lan Wangji pushes him back. As fast as his heartbeat was, his face looks the same\u2014stern and cold. \u201cIf you walked into town like that\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t have to finish. If Wei Wuxian had walked in the way he was dressed, in his current state, he would have been recognized immediately and too weak to stop them when they took him and turned him in for the reward. Wei Wuxian bites his lip.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s the fever,\u201d Lan Wangji makes his excuse for him. After a moment, he turns and unsheathes Bichen. \u201cGet on my back.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian loops his arms around Lan Wangji as they begin to fly again. But Wei Wuxian knows that while he might not be completely clear-minded right now, when he headed for town, he was only thinking of Lan Zhan.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wherever Lan Wangji is taking them, the towns are further and further apart, and so are the houses. Food gets scarcer when they cannot go buy it, so even when Wei Wuxian\u2019s fever breaks, he still feels weak and tired all of the time.</p>\n<p>On the sixth day, Lan Wangji breaks another GusuLan rule, and catches two small pheasants. He roasts them over the fire, and the smell wakes Wei Wuxian, hungry and nauseous at the same time.</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji eats with his eyes cast to the ground where nothing is left of the pheasants apart from a pile of soft, red-brown feathers and white bone. Wei Wuxian looks at him, and then looks away, ashamed and guilty.</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji stops eating and half-turns. Wei Wuxian thinks he can hear the snap of a twig somewhere in the distance.</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji hands the remains of his pheasant to Wei Wuxian and stands. His fingers tighten on Bichen\u2019s hilt.</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian freezes as well, and waits for something to happen.</p>\n<p>A rabbit hops out of the bushes, nose twitching.</p>\n<p>They both stare at it, and Wei Wuxian laughs for the first time in weeks. The rabbit immediately startles and darts back into the bushes, but Wei Wuxian can\u2019t stop laughing. He laughs until his ribs hurt, and Lan Wangji is staring at him in alarm.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, I\u2019m okay,\u201d Wei Wuxian says, gasping as the last of his laughter calms into breathless chuckling. \u201cI thought\u2014I thought\u2014and it was a <em> rabbit </em>\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji shifts and gives him a look.</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian\u2019s laughter trails off into a smile. \u201cLet me see your wound,\u201d he says to him.</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji lets Wei Wuxian come close and undress him. The wound doesn\u2019t look any better after so many days, but it doesn\u2019t look worse.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll clean it for you,\u201d Wei Wuxian says.</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji stiffens.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, right, I forgot you hate people touching you,\u201d Wei Wuxian says. Then he grins. \u201cBut you touched me, Lan Wangji. You\u2019ve been carrying me on your back every day now, Lan Er-Gege,\u201d he teases.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s sure Lan Wangji is going to throw him off, but he doesn\u2019t move, allowing Wei Wuxian to rinse a corner of his robe in the stream and press it to the wound. Under the firelight, Wei Wuxian can see Lan Wangji\u2019s muscles tighten. It must hurt, but he doesn\u2019t make a sound, letting Wei Wuxian slowly wipe along the cut until just a red wound is left.</p>\n<p>Since Lan Wangji has let him get away with this much, Wei Wuxian reaches into his loosened robes and rummages until he finds the medicinal pouch. There isn\u2019t much left.</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji catches him by the wrist. \u201cNo.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m better. I feel much better really so I don\u2019t need it anymore,\u201d Wei Wuxian says. He doesn\u2019t wait for an agreement, but crushes it and presses it into the wound.</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji lets out a hissed breath.</p>\n<p>\u201cLet me wash your shirt.\u201d Wei Wuxian tugs at the undergarment.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCome on, I\u2019ve already cleaned your wound, touched you\u2014don\u2019t forget we\u2019ve already bathed together too,\u201d Wei Wuxian says as he continues to undress him. \u201cI know you like to be clean and that shirt is not clean.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji frowns, but he lets Wei Wuxian strip him of the shirt.</p>\n<p>Even though the night has fallen, the moon is high and Wei Wuxian scrubs Lan Wangji\u2019s shirt as much as he can with what strength he has. Even when he\u2019s done, the blood has been stained too many days to wash out. He\u2019s still not completely recovered from his fever and he tires easily. When he makes his way back over to Lan Wangji, he sees the other man has fallen asleep.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s silent apart from the whispering stream, the rustling trees, and the last snapping embers from the fire.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>On the seventh day, Wei Wuxian\u2019s fever completely recedes, and it makes him aware. Even physically recovered, Suibian hangs useless at his waist. He can\u2019t fly, he can\u2019t fight, he can\u2019t practice spells, he can\u2019t run as fast or jump as far or any of the things he\u2019d once been able to do without thinking about it. Even traveling this way, Lan Wangji is the one holding him. He can do nothing to help him, to help Jiang Cheng, to help even himself.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou should leave me,\u201d he says, letting it slip out when the thought comes, the wind carrying away his voice. Lan Wangji\u2019s shoulders stiffen beneath him. \u201cI\u2019m only a burden.\u201d He should let go. They\u2019re not flying high enough for the fall to hurt him probably\u2014at least, it wouldn\u2019t have in the past\u2014but his arms don\u2019t loosen from around Lan Wangji\u2019s neck.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Lan Wangji says, just as quiet, a rumble Wei Wuxian feels vibrate through him.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d Wei Wuxian whispers.</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji doesn\u2019t say anything for a long time, and then, \u201cI\u2019m not letting you go.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian bites his lip and presses his nose into Lan Wangji\u2019s neck, breathing in the faint traces of sandalwood left on his skin.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>That night, Lan Wangji lands them close to a small farmhouse\u2014the only one in the area they\u2019ve come across for hours now. The family living there would be normal citizens. Isolated out here with no other buildings nearby, it would be even less likely that they would have heard of Wei Wuxian.</p>\n<p>When Lan Wangji knocks on the door, the family lets them in with all the hospitality of country folk. The wife hurries to make them a meal, and the husband tells the two children to draw a bath for their visitors. He thinks Lan Wangji is trying to make him feel better.</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian hasn\u2019t been this grateful for a bowl of rice and some simple dishes in a long time.</p>\n<p>The boys are fascinated by the visitors and ask question after question.</p>\n<p>Even with his stoic face, Wei Wuxian can tell Lan Wangji is uncomfortable, so he fields most of the conversation, spinning half-truths and lies.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhere did you come from? Why do you have swords? Are you a cultivator?\u201d The elder asks. The family only introduced the boys as Gege and Didi\u2014older brother, and younger brother.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m not a cultivator,\u201d Wei Wuxian says. It\u2019s harder to admit than he wants. \u201cWe were just merchants, delivering some goods, but we were robbed on our way back. Thank goodness we got away with our swords.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian shoots Lan Wangji a glance. Lying, of course, breaks another GusuLan rule, but he\u2019s already broken at least a half-dozen by now. Lan Wangji doesn\u2019t correct him.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d the husband says. \u201cWe\u2019re too far from the cultivation world here\u2014what would cultivators be doing here? But brigands and outlaws hide out here to escape the law. We\u2019ve more of those than pheasants!\u201d He laughs.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re not injured, are you?\u201d the wife asks. \u201cThe nearest doctor lives a day\u2019s walk away, but we can send for him.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re fine now that we\u2019re eating this wonderful cooking,\u201d Wei Wuxian says, and the wife giggles.</p>\n<p>\u201cHave another bowl then,\u201d she says, refilling it without waiting for an answer. \u201cEat. Eat.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDid you see any walking corpses on the way?\u201d Didi speaks up. \u201cI want to see a walking corpse!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou stop talking nonsense right now, Didi!\u201d his mother scolds.</p>\n<p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, you don\u2019t want to see a walking corpse,\u201d Wei Wuxian tells the boy. \u201cThey\u2019re very scary, all stiff because they\u2019ve been dead so long, so they can only hop like this.\u201d He gets to his feet and gives a few hops, arms outstretched until he locks his hands around the younger boy\u2019s neck.</p>\n<p>Didi squeals when Wei Wuxian tickles him, collapsing to the ground in laughter.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t sound scary at all,\u201d Gege says.</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian straightens up. \u201cOh, you don\u2019t think so until it it tries to suck the life out of you,\u201d he says, sobering up. \u201cIf it catches you\u2014scratches you, bites you, it infects you with corpse poisoning, and then you become one of them if you don\u2019t get an antidote in time.\u201d</p>\n<p>The boys listen with wide eyes.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd worse of all.\u201d Wei Wuxian leans close to whisper. \u201cThey smell really <em> really </em> bad. Smelling one will put you off your dinner for a week!\u201d He smiles and pats them on their heads. \u201cSo be good boys and listen to your parents. Don\u2019t stay out too late, don\u2019t wander off on your own.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cListen to him,\u201d the mother says.</p>\n<p>\u201cI take it you have some experience with walking corpses then?\u201d the father asks. \u201cYou\u2019re really not cultivators?\u201d</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian shakes his head. \u201cNo, just very unlucky,\u201d he says. His grin seems to relax the husband who continues to ask about new gossip and news.</p>\n<p>After dinner, the boys are sent to bed. Wei Wuxian has a one-sided argument with Lan Wangji that he\u2019s only half upset he loses, and gets sent to the tub where he submerges himself with a sigh. He scrapes the dirt and blood off of his skin and washes it out of his hair. His skin is a motley of yellow and purple bruises, though thankfully, no larger injuries.</p>\n<p>The family is good enough to lend them some spare robes, while the wife takes their dirty ones to wash.</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji takes his turn after Wei Wuxian, while Wei Wuxian goes to chat with the husband and wife some more. They\u2019re shelling peanuts by lamp light and Wei Wuxian is trying to subtly find out where exactly they are, when Lan Wangji comes back in.</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian stares.</p>\n<p>They\u2019d both been covered in grime for the past week, so he\u2019d forgotten just how beautiful Lan Wangji is. It had gotten dark while Lan Wangji bathed, and the couple owns only one lantern. When Lan Wangji comes in, he\u2019s backlit by the bright moon outside, but the fire illuminates his pale eyes, burnishing them golden. Even dressed in the borrowed clothes, dyed a drab green, Lan Wangji wears them with the grace of an emperor.</p>\n<p>The couple look stunned at Lan Wangji, and Wei Wuxian grins at their reaction. He really is handsome.</p>\n<p>\u201cReady for bed?\u201d Wei Wuxian asks, getting to his feet.</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji gives a short nod, and the couple rushes to put out spare bedding for their visitors. The house is really barely more than a hut, so it only has two main rooms\u2014a bedroom that the whole family shares, and the common room where they do everything else. Wei Wuxian and Lan Wangji are given a couple of straw mats to lay on the floor of the common room and two thin blankets.</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian lays on his mat, and stares up at the ceiling, not a star in sight beneath the solid roof over their heads. He can hear quiet murmurs that turn into loud snores coming from the bedroom.</p>\n<p>He glances over at Lan Wangji who is lying completely still on his mat in perfect posture. Even his hair is straight and not a strand is out of place.</p>\n<p>The window is open, letting in a square of moonlight on the floor between their mats. Even though it\u2019s late spring now, the nights are still cold and Wei Wuxian can feel the wind coming through the window and shivers. He moves a little closer to Lan Wangji.</p>\n<p>\u201cLan Zhan\u2026\u201d he whispers. \u201cHow is your wound?\u201d he asks, voice low.</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji opens his eyes and looks over at Wei Wuxian. \u201cBetter,\u201d he says.</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian gets up and crosses the moonlight to his side. \u201cLet me see,\u201d he says.</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji exhales, but he moves to sit up.</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian catches his hand as he does. \u201cLet me,\u201d he says. His heart is beating fast. He doesn\u2019t completely know what he\u2019s doing when he pulls aside Lan Wangji\u2019s blanket. He grasps the sash tying his robe together and tugs it loose, feeling the rough fabric slide between his fingers.</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji\u2019s eyes on him are like molten gold, but he doesn\u2019t move as his shirt falls open.</p>\n<p>The wound, like he said, is better. It\u2019s clean and the skin is only a little pink\u2014none of the red inflammation that Wei Wuxian had been afraid to see. It\u2019s scabbed over for the most part, and on its way to healing.</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian grazes his hand gently along the run of the wound and then over Lan Wangji\u2019s stomach where, even under the skim of his fingers, he can feel the hard muscle and warm skin. His own heart is beating fast, and he begins drawing his hand away.</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji catches his wrist again and pulls him so suddenly that Wei Wuxian falls right on top of him.</p>\n<p>\u201cLan Zhan! Your wound!\u201d Wei Wuxian says, horrified, right before Lan Wangji\u2019s mouth closes on his.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>They can\u2019t do much\u2014not with Lan Wangji\u2019s wound and the family only a thin wood panel away. Lan Wangji pries open Wei Wuxian\u2019s mouth, licking into it, and igniting a trail of fire with every press of his strong fingers into Wei Wuxian\u2019s skin. He pulls Wei Wuxian\u2019s thighs apart, moving his hips in small, grinding circles up into him, and Wei Wuxian clings on\u2014twisting around Lan Wangji until he\u2019s entirely in his lap, rubbing up and down to the same rhythm.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s uncomplicated, and it doesn\u2019t take long. Wei Wuxian comes first, kept quiet only by Lan Wangji pressing his mouth to his lips again, swallowing his gasps. When Wei Wuxian comes back to himself, Lan Wangji is still moving against him, an intense look on his face, biting his own lip to keep quiet, and holding onto Wei Wuxian so tightly he\u2019ll surely have bruises in the morning. Wei Wuxian smiles, holding Lan Wangji close and rubbing his shoulder and urging him to go faster\u2014faster, you can do better than that, Lan Wangji, Lan Zhan, Lan Er-Gege, come on\u2014until Lan Wangji comes, burying his face deep into the curve of Wei Wuxian\u2019s shoulder.</p>\n<p>By the time the family stumbles from their room, trying hard to keep quiet as they set about morning chores, they\u2019re already on separate mats again.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>They stay with the family. They don\u2019t mean to\u2014every day, Wei Wuxian thinks this is the day they should leave, but the first day, their freshly washed robes have to dry in the sun, so he and Lan Wangji go and help the husband tend to his field while they wait. The second day is the wife\u2019s weaving day and Gege\u2019s shirt is already so worn through that there\u2019s holes in the elbows, and an extra pair of hands would help so much so Wei Wuxian volunteers. He makes a worse mess of it, so they stay a third day for Lan Wangji to help untangle the threads he\u2019s messed up while they switch and Wei Wuxian goes back out to the field.</p>\n<p>Three days turns into four turns into a week turns into two.</p>\n<p>As the days pass, the weather creeps into summer and it gets warmer as well. Wei Wuxian and Lan Wangji spend most days out with the father. Lan Wangji prefers the tediousness of tending to the fields, pulling weeds and wading in ankle-deep water, helping the plants grow. Wei Wuxian likes going hunting, setting traps and catching the meat he can take home.</p>\n<p>One day, Wei Wuxian spends paring a bow and a set of crude arrows. He takes the boys hunting, teaching them proper form and how to aim and shoot. It takes several days before Gege finally catches a fat, old pheasant, but the boys march back like the greatest warriors, and eagerly help pluck and cook their catch. Wei Wuxian helps and adds so much spice to the dinner that the boys tear up, but are too proud of themselves to stop eating.</p>\n<p>And every night, after the family retires, he and Lan Wangji find themselves beneath the same blanket. Lan Wangji covers Wei Wuxian\u2019s mouth to keep him quiet, but he never uses the silencing spell, swallowing every gasp and moan.</p>\n<p>As the days pass and the weather turns from warm to sweltering, the ache in his chest doesn\u2019t fade, but Wei Wuxian grows accustomed to it. He tells the family stories after dinner\u2014acting out the fight scenes himself and pulling Lan Wangji to his feet to be a standing prop as Wei Wuxian darts around him. The stories are half real, half made up, and he takes exaggerated bows when the boys clap for him and demand another.</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji doesn\u2019t exactly smile more or speak more, but something about him relaxes. He smells like sun and sweat and fresh grass from the field.</p>\n<p>One afternoon, they finish their chores early, and Wei Wuxian grabs Lan Wangji by the hand, laughing as he pulls him into the nearby woods.</p>\n<p>\u201cDinner,\u201d Lan Wangji reminds him.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ve still a few hours before then,\u201d Wei Wuxian says, grinning at him. He leans forward to press a quick kiss to Lan Wangji\u2019s lips. \u201cI want to show you something,\u201d he says. \u201cI found it last time I took the boys pheasant-hunting.\u201d</p>\n<p>His surprise is a little blue lake about a thirty minute walk from the house. Surrounded by trees, the only sounds that can be heard there is the rush from the waterfall filling the lake, and the occasional bird call and stir of the canopy.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not as cold as the one in the Cloud Recesses,\u201d Wei Wuxian says, looking between the pool and Lan Wangji\u2019s face. \u201cBut it\u2019s pretty, right?\u201d he says, nervous all of a sudden. \u201cI remember how much you liked to cultivate there, so when I found this place, I thought\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s pretty,\u201d Lan Wangji says.</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian didn\u2019t realize his grip had been tightening around Lan Wangji\u2019s fingers until he loosens them. He grins at him. \u201cThen what are you waiting for?\u201d he says, undoing his own robe and stripping down. He leaves Suibian by his clothes, still unable to rid himself of the habit of carrying it everywhere even though he hasn\u2019t used it in a long time.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2014here?\u201d Lan Wangji asks.</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian kicks his shoes off and jumps in the water, shouting from the cold. He winks at Lan Wangji over his shoulder. \u201cOh, what are you thinking about, Lan Zhan, didn\u2019t I already say I brought you here so you could cultivate?\u201d he teases, but when Lan Wangji joins him in the lake, Wei Wuxian circles his arms around Lan Wangji\u2019s neck.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Lan Wangji says.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s warmer where you are,\u201d Wei Wuxian says with a grin.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not,\u201d Lan Wangji says.</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian\u2019s grin widens. \u201cAre you saying you want me to leave?\u201d He begins drawing away, and laughs when Lan Wangji\u2019s hands come around his waist, holding him in place. \u201cSo you don\u2019t want me to leave after all?\u201d he says. \u201cYou want me to stay? With you? Forever?\u201d</p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t expect Lan Wangji to nod\u2014just one, short, emphatic dip of his chin.</p>\n<p>The water doesn\u2019t feel cold anymore, and Wei Wuxian can\u2019t stop smiling. He reaches up to tug at the ribbon around Lan Wangji\u2019s forehead. \u201cYou\u2019re still wearing this even now?\u201d he says. They\u2019ve been wearing the homespun clothes of the little family since they came, their tattered uniforms put away long ago\u2014unsuitable for farm labor\u2014all except for this ribbon still left on Lan Wangji\u2019s forehead.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou can take it off.\u201d Lan WangJ\u2019s eyes bore into him, like he\u2019s trying to tell Wei Wuxian something without words.</p>\n<p>\u201cReally? And to think you got so angry when I accidentally pulled it loose that time,\u201d Wei Wuxian says, reaching up. He tugs it gently, still a little hesitant, but Lan Wangji doesn\u2019t stop him. Only his hands tighten, thumbs pressing into Wei Wuxian\u2019s hips when it comes off entirely.</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji reaches for the ribbon once it\u2019s come off, but Wei Wuxian holds it away from him with an exaggerated pout. \u201cHey, you can\u2019t take it back once you\u2019ve given it to me,\u201d he says.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not taking it back.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji reaches for it again, and this time, Wei Wuxian lets him. He watches, curious, when Lan Wangji loops the ribbon around Wei Wuxian\u2019s left wrist and winds it around and around, only tying the ends once it\u2019s completely been wound like a bandage. Lan Wangji has wrapped it firmly on Wei Wuxian\u2019s wrist but not too tight, like someone is holding his hand, and Wei Wuxian can see the clouds imprinted on the ribbon.</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji\u2019s thumb brushes against the fabric, and lifts Wei Wuxian\u2019s hand up to press a kiss to the ribbon, reverent. His light eyes stare into him like he\u2019s trying to look into Wei Wuxian\u2019s very soul\u2014 Wei Wuxian wishes he could give it to him.</p>\n<p>He pulls closer and kisses Lan Wangji. \u201cLan Zhan, Lan Zhan,\u201d he whispers and sighs as Lan Wangji dips forward, ghosting his lips against Wei Wuxian\u2019s lips, then his jaw, then his neck, until Wei Wuxian can\u2019t stand not kissing him for a moment longer. From there, there\u2019s no stopping any of it\u2014how they lick into each other\u2019s mouth, biting at one another. Wei Wuxian\u2019s used to muffling his voice with his knuckles when they do this in the confines of the little hut, but this time, Lan Wangji pulls his hand away, the one wrapped in the ribbon, and Wei Wuxian\u2019s voice echoes across the waters.</p>\n<p>It happens there in the water. Lan Wangji\u2019s fingers play Wei Wuxian\u2019s body like a guqin, wringing gasps out of him as he demands more, arching into them. When Lan Wangji does, it hurts, and Wei Wuxian locks up around him, tears leaking from his eyes as he tells him how much it hurts and it\u2019s his first time and wasn\u2019t it supposed to feel good. Lan Wangji tries to soothe him without words, running careful hands down his body and pressing kisses into his brow, as Wei Wuxian waits for it to get better when it feels like he\u2019s being split open.</p>\n<p>Eventually it does\u2014the pain fades to an ache, and then Lan Wangji presses a spot inside him that makes Wei Wuxian\u2019s voice ring the ripples in the water, and then it\u2019s good\u2014so good, Wei Wuxian\u2019s nails digging into his shoulders and telling him to hit that spot again, again, go faster, slower, harder, and then nothing but Lan Zhan, Lan Zhan, Lan Zhan\u2014</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Much later, they head back for the house, holding hands.</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian can\u2019t stop glancing over at Lan Wangji every few moments, even when Lan Wangji\u2019s thumb traces circles over his pulse point where it\u2019s been wrapped in the ribbon.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re late for dinner,\u201d Wei Wuxian says, swinging their joined hands. \u201cDo you think they saved food for us? If not, I can always cook for you. Hanguang-Jun has no problem with my cooking, right?\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji gives a low grunt of agreement.</p>\n<p>\u201cEven after doing me like that, you still hate to talk?\u201d Wei Wuxian teases him. \u201cDon\u2019t you think we\u2019re close enough now that you can say a few more words?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat do you want me to say?\u201d Lan Wangji asks.</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian laughs. \u201cYou even need me to teach you how to hold a conversation,\u201d he says and leans a little closer, putting his head against Lan Wangji\u2019s shoulder for just a moment. They\u2019re nearly the same height, but Wei Wuxian wants to tease him a little, peering up at him through his eyelashes. \u201cHow about asking me how I feel? If I\u2019m sore? If I need you to carry me? Or if I want you to\u2026\u201d He whispers a filthy suggestion in his ear.</p>\n<p>He laughs when he\u2019s swept into Lan Wangji\u2019s arms, and Lan Wangji strides more purposefully toward the house.</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian is still teasing him, nipping at his earlobe and whispering into his ear, when they crest the hill overlooking the house and Lan Wangji stops walking.</p>\n<p>With the sudden stiff set of his shoulders, Wei Wuxian also hears the voices coming from below and slowly drops his feet to the ground.</p>\n<p>\u201cDrag the bodies to the back. We want to be ready when that Wei Wuxian comes back with his Lan-dog!\u201d Wei Wuxian recognizes the haughty, high whine of Wen Chao\u2019s voice even from a distance.</p>\n<p>In front of the house, there are four bodies in green lying on dark ground\u2014two larger, two smaller\u2014and Lan Wangji barely grasps Wei Wuxian\u2019s mouth and presses it shut before he starts to scream. He shakes in Lan Wangji\u2019s grip.</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you sure they\u2019re here?\u201d Wang LingJiao asks. \u201cIt looks like only those country hicks lived here.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBring the robes,\u201d Wen Chao orders. One of the Wen disciples brings two sets of robes out of the house, one light and one dark\u2014Lan Wangji\u2019s white sect uniform, and Wei Wuxian\u2019s YunMengJiang uniform that neither of them has worn in weeks now. \u201cInstead of turning them in, this family sheltered them? They deserved to die!\u201d He turns toward the house. \u201cSearch every inch of this farm\u2014no corner of that field goes unsearched! Drag those traitors out!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m going to kill him!\u201d Wei Wuxian hisses against Lan Wangji\u2019s palm, struggling as he sees Wen Chao and Wang LingJiao disappear into the house. \u201cLet go of me! I\u2019m going to <em> kill him! </em>\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji pushes until Wei Wuxian\u2019s hiding his face in Lan Wangji\u2019s shoulder, muffling his tears and his frustration when the Wen servants begin dragging the bodies away.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>They run. All night, Lan Wangji holds tight to Wei Wuxian\u2019s wrist, forcing him to stumble after him. It\u2019s too dark to see in the forest for them to fly on Bichen, and too risky with the Wen sect disciples searching for them.</p>\n<p>When the golden rays of dawn break, Wei Wuxian\u2019s tears have dried. They can\u2019t go on like this.</p>\n<p>Even at the edge of the world, so far from everything, the sun beats down on them. It stops raining, and they kick up clouds of yellow dust even on the side roads they\u2019re keeping to. They spend nights tossing and turning on the hard ground, too hot and sweat-sticky in their homespun clothes.</p>\n<p>One afternoon, trudging along the road, Wei Wuxian feels the sweat trickle down his neck. He\u2019s been so hot for so long that he doesn\u2019t really feel it anymore, doesn\u2019t think he\u2019s even sweating now, just putting one foot in front of another, staring down at his own shadow. His head throbs and he can\u2019t quite catch his breath and then the world is going dim and he hears Lan Zhan shouting his name.</p>\n<p>He caught sunstroke, Lan Wangji tells him when he wakes again. Lan Wangji sets a slower pace then. At nightfall, they use the last of their money to book a room at an inn in a little, nameless town.</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian drinks all the tepid, dusty water that is brought to their room, and sleeps all night. They don\u2019t leave in the morning even though the room grows hotter as the sun rises higher in the sky.</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji fucks Wei Wuxian, fast the first time, and then slow, and then a third time. Even though they\u2019re facing each other, Lan Wangji\u2019s face is buried in Wei Wuxian\u2019s shoulder, biting until there must be imprints and bruises left on his skin.</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian gasps, breathless, digs his fingers deeper into the flesh of Lan Wangji\u2019s back, pressing his heel into the back of Lan Wangji\u2019s thigh and arches up, welcoming the pain and gasping praises and profanities.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d he pants into Lan Wangji\u2019s ear, lips wet as he bites into the lobe. \u201cYes, yes, oh god\u2014yes, right there, Lan Zhan, don\u2019t stop\u2014don\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>When Lan Wangji sleeps, unmoving under the sheets, Wei Wuxian lingers by the window, looking for a glimpse of green at the dusty, tan street below. He thinks about times when he was happy, when things weren\u2019t golden, maybe, but the sun wasn\u2019t so large and the people he loved were safe.</p>\n<p>He turns away when he sees the red uniform of the Wen sect disciples, pulling the window shut again even though it\u2019s stuffy and too warm in their little room. He gets back into bed beside Lan Wangji, kisses his shoulder, breathes the smell of sweat and dust.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>On the third morning, Wei Wuxian wakes, and Lan Wangji is not there.</p>\n<p>He comes back a few hours later with supplies\u2014a thin cloak and fresh meatbuns and even a jar of the local alcohol\u2014safe and unhurt, but Wei Wuxian pushes Lan Wangji against the door, shoves and hits him with weak fists.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat were you thinking?\u201d he yells. \u201cI woke up and you weren\u2019t there, Lan Wangji\u2014what the hell was I supposed to think\u2014how\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji kisses him, even as Wei Wuxian continues to protest and push him away. He holds onto Wei Wuxian, insisting and kissing until Wei Wuxian gives in and kisses him back, desperate and violent and hurting.</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji tries to push him in the direction of the bed, but Wei Wuxian pulls him down to the ground. On the dirty wooden floor, Lan Wangji holds Wei Wuxian\u2019s face, kissing away the tears that come and Wei Wuxian clutches at his shirt as he sobs desperately, telling Lan Wangji that he can\u2019t be worth it, that Lan Wangji must know how he\u2019s better off without him, how Wei Wuxian has messed up so badly and he wouldn\u2019t blame Lan Wangji for wishing he\u2019d never met him, and if Wei Wuxian could have died back in Yiling, then\u2014</p>\n<p>\u201cEverything is going to be okay,\u201d Lan Wangji promises, holding Wei Wuxian close.</p>\n<p>\u201cHow can you say that?\u201d Wei Wuxian yells, pushing against him. \u201cEverything I touch dies! How am I supposed to\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>He feels his body go numb and his lips seal themselves. It\u2019s been weeks since Lan Wangji last used either spell on him.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou are going to be okay,\u201d Lan Wangji repeats in the sudden silence.</p>\n<p>He bundles Wei Wuxian into that new cloak he just bought, wrapping it securely around his shoulders and pushing the hood up over his head. Lan Wangji holds him by the waist, dragging him along, but the cloak is so long that no one can tell Wei Wuxian isn\u2019t moving on his own. To the world, it must look like one young man is supporting his drunk friend.</p>\n<p>Like this, they make their way down the stairs and leave the inn. With his head hanging and no way to hold it up, Wei Wuxian can only see the dust of the streets and the boots of the people they pass by. After awhile, he sees more and more of the white-and-red boots of the Wen Sect. He listens, waits for someone to recognize Lan Wangji and stop them, but no one does.</p>\n<p>They turn a corner and then another, and then Lan Wangji is stepping into over the threshold of a compound. Lan Wangji lifts him a little higher so his feet won\u2019t drag over the step.</p>\n<p>\u201cYoung Master Lan! Is that Young Master Wei?\u201d</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian recognizes the voice, and struggles with renewed vigor. It\u2019s Wen Ning.</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji grunts.</p>\n<p>\u201cQuickly, this way,\u201d Wen Ning says.</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian wishes he could do anything to stop this. He wills his body to move\u2014if just a finger could move, tell Wen Ning he didn\u2019t want this.</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji\u2019s steps are assured and steady, but too soon, they\u2019re crossing the threshold of an inner building within the compound.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s him?\u201d Wen Qing\u2019s voice.</p>\n<p>Had Lan Wangji arranged this too when he was gone for those few hours?</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian struggles, willing his left pinky to move. He can still feel everything\u2014the cloth of Lan Wangji\u2019s ribbon wrapped around that hand, the way his body is slumped into Lan Wangji, the smell of him\u2014he can\u2019t let him do this.</p>\n<p>He still hasn\u2019t gotten himself to move before Lan Wangji puts him down on a bed. He can see with the hood of the cloak thrown back, Lan Wangji bends over him, smoothing his hair back from his face. Wei Wuxian tries to shake his head, open his mouth, but he can\u2019t, and all too soon, Lan Wangji turns away from him.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re really sure this is what you want?\u201d Wen Qing asks. \u201cIt\u2019s a difficult procedure. With Jiang Cheng, it took seven days. With what you want, it will take longer, and it has a low chance of success.\u201d She pauses. \u201cEven as a medical practitioner, I\u2019ve never attempted what you\u2019re asking me to do,\u201d she says. \u201cIf things go wrong, you could both die.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lan Wangji replies slow, like every word is being forced out of him. \u201cWei Ying is already prepared to die.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian hates that Lan Wangji knows this, that for all he\u2019s tried to be happy with just Lan Zhan, he can\u2019t\u2014not with the heavy sun hanging over them both, and their shadows stretching too thin for too long\u2014in this world, he can never have what he wants.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd you?\u201d Wen Qing asks.</p>\n<p>The answer comes easily. \u201cI bowed once,\u201d Lan Wangji says.</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian can\u2019t imagine Lan Wangji bowing to anyone\u2014the proud Hanguang-Jun, on his knees, begging Wen Qing for this favor, and yet, he\u2019s already seen him do so many things he never imagined he\u2019d see.</p>\n<p>Wen Qing exhales and finally comes in view of Wei Wuxian. Wei Wuxian struggles, pushing against the bonds of the spell, but he couldn\u2019t free himself even with his golden core, and he can\u2019t do anything now.</p>\n<p>Wen Qing leans over him, and Wei Wuxian tries to shake his head, to do anything, as he sees the needle she\u2019s holding get closer and closer.</p>\n<p>He feels a prick in the center of his forehead, and everything goes black.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He dreams of Lotus Pier, of days spent plucking lotus pods and digging the seeds out, of flying kites with Jiang Cheng and the younger disciples, competing to see who can fly them the farthest and still shoot them down. He dreams of the subtle taste of his shijie\u2019s lotus rib soup, of Jiang FengMian\u2019s warm smile, of Yu ZiYuan ordering him to protect Jiang Cheng with his life. He dreams of the Cloud Recesses, of tranquil hours spent dozing in the library to the smell of sandalwood and the sound of Lan Wangji\u2019s breathing. He dreams of the archery contest, of the stench of the XuanWu of Slaughter, of the piles of bodies in purple uniforms stacked irreverently in the courtyard, of the four in green laid out on the dusty doorstep of the farm. He dreams of Lan Wangji\u2019s touch, of the nights they spent gasping into each others\u2019 mouths, of his golden eyes burning a trail to Wei Wuxian\u2019s skin everywhere he gazes. He dreams of pulling off Lan Wangji\u2019s ribbon, and Lan Wangji tying it to his wrist, staring at him all the while, too sincere\u2014a promise.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian wakes to a dim room. The windows of the room are shut tight, keeping the sun away. He\u2019s stiff, like he\u2019s been lying in the same position for too long, and he shifts. He can turn, he can move, he can\u2014Lan Zhan\u2014</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian sits up, throwing back the sheets covering him.</p>\n<p>It startles Wen Ning badly who drops a bowl of foul-smelling medicine and immediately begins apologizing and backing out of the room again, but Wei Wuxian only has eyes for the man lying in a cot an arms\u2019 length away from him.</p>\n<p>\u201cLan Zhan\u2014Lan\u2014\u201d Wei Wuxian feels the qi inside him flare, a rush through his body stronger than he\u2019s ever felt before\u2014this was always the difference between the core he\u2019d cultivated and Lan Wangji\u2019s hours of discipline. Wei Wuxian can\u2019t breathe. \u201cYou\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>As he stumbles over, reaching for him, Lan Wangji\u2019s eyes open, and he feels another rush of something pounding where his golden core rests. He feels a warmth begin from somewhere in his chest and then the feeling spreads through him, happiness and a deep joy and complete contentment. The feeling is so intense, Wei Wuxian\u2019s legs buckle and he collapses against Lan Wangji. The feeling dies down for a moment, surprised, before Lan Wangji slowly sits up and rearranges them so Wei Wuxian is being pulled against him, being held, and the feeling comes back stronger and stronger\u2014so much\u2014too much\u2014</p>\n<p>\u201cLan Zhan,\u201d he whispers, trying to hold back the tears pricking his eyes because he can\u2019t bear to feel this much\u2014like being submerged in an ocean so deep he can\u2019t breathe. \u201cYou\u2014\u201d He stares into those golden eyes, and for the first time, comprehends everything Lan Wangji can\u2019t say because words can\u2019t express this.</p>\n<p>\u201cCongratulations, the operation was successful.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian startles and only Lan Wangji\u2019s arm around his hip keeps him from falling off the cot.</p>\n<p>Wen Qing watches them from her seat at a table. She\u2019s calmly sipping from a cup of tea, but she looks pale and tired.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat did you\u2014\u201d Wei Wuxian breaks off and tries again. \u201cHow can I\u2014why do I feel\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYour Hanguang-Jun begged me on his knees to cut out half his golden core and give it to you,\u201d Wen Qing says. \u201cIt\u2019s the riskiest golden core operation. In theory, it\u2019s possible, but never performed successfully before now.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian feels the golden core within him pulse, and he doesn\u2019t know if it\u2019s coming from him or Lan Wangji. \u201cSo we each have half a core? How is that possible?\u201d he asks. \u201cI can\u2014I can <em> feel </em> him.\u201d His fingers tighten around the collar of Lan Wangji\u2019s robe where his hand is curled. \u201cIt\u2019s strong. This isn\u2019t\u2014this <em> can\u2019t </em> be only half his core.\u201d If this was only half Lan Wangji\u2019s golden core, he\u2019d be strong enough to conquer the cultivation world single-handedly.</p>\n<p>Wen Ning sighs and rubs at her temple with one hand. \u201cApparently, it\u2019s not possible. A golden core must always be whole\u2014you can\u2019t have half a core,\u201d she says. \u201cBut you can share one.\u201d</p>\n<p>They share a core.</p>\n<p>\n<em> They share a core. </em>\n</p>\n<p>The words resonate in him, bouncing back and forth, the repeating echo of a truth and a feeling\u2014a revelation. There\u2019s another surge in his chest so intense it leaves him gasping, and he has to\u2014regardless of their audience\u2014take Lan Wangji\u2019s face into his hands and kiss him again and again.</p>\n<p>\u201cPlease control yourself,\u201d Wen Qing says after a moment.</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian feels a surge of annoyance and restlessness this time, and he laughs, pulling away from Lan Wangji, but not so far as to not still be touching.</p>\n<p>\u201cAs you\u2019re the first case, you\u2019ll have to find out the side effects for yourself, but from the literature, I have a few guesses of what you\u2019ll experience,\u201d Wen Qing says, and then more impatiently, \u201cAre you paying attention, Wei Wuxian?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, of course!\u201d Wei Wuxian says, drawing back from where he\u2019d been leaning in to Lan Wangji again like gravity.</p>\n<p>\u201cFirst, the disadvantages,\u201d Wen Qing says. \u201cI couldn\u2019t divide Hanguang-Jun\u2019s core\u2014I nearly lost both of you in the operation, and the only way to save you\u2014the reason why you share a core now\u2014was to tie the core to your souls,\u201d she says. \u201cBut that means, if one of you dies, so will the other,\u201d she says.</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian remembers the helplessness, the fear, the panic he\u2019d felt when Lan Wangji brought him here. Lan Wangji tightens his grip, pulling until Wei Wuxian is leaning, pressed back to front, and he can feel Lan Wangji\u2019s slow, calming heartbeat.</p>\n<p>\u201cAdvantages\u2014most likely, if you both cultivate, your core will grow at twice the rate,\u201d she says. \u201cBut you come from different sects with different practices, so you\u2019ll have to be doubly careful of qi deviation.\u201d She gives Wei Wuxian an especially pointed look.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe rest, you\u2019ll have to find out on your own,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019ll have Wen Ning bring medicine. You can stay the night, and then you have to go. You can\u2019t be caught here.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Wei Wuxian says as she gets up to go.</p>\n<p>Wen Qing pauses in her footsteps. She shoots them one last look before she leaves. \u201cYou better not show up here with another request after this, Wei Wuxian,\u201d she says.</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian beams at her. \u201cI can\u2019t make promises,\u201d he says, and feels a surge of annoyance from Lan Wangji. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll need to,\u201d he says quickly.</p>\n<p>Even with his words, it takes awhile for the concern to fade.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m just joking, Lan Zhan,\u201d Wei Wuxian says to him. \u201cReally, you know what I\u2019m like\u2014you <em> really </em> know now, don\u2019t you? You can feel me like I can feel you, can\u2019t you?\u201d He presses his hand to Lan Wangji\u2019s chest and feels the warmth run through him, like a flame spreading through his veins until Wei Wuxian\u2019s suffocating. He gasps for breath, collapsed against Lan Wangji. \u201cHow can you feel so much?\u201d he asks. \u201cAnd make no expression at all?\u201d He presses a finger to Lan Wangji\u2019s brow.</p>\n<p>\u201cSorry,\u201d Lan Wangji says.</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian laughs. \u201cAh, you\u2019re much easier to understand this way, Lan Zhan,\u201d he says. \u201cEven if you brought me here against my will,\u201d he says. \u201cYou know I really thought you were going to give your golden core to me. I would have never forgiven you if you did.\u201d</p>\n<p>He feels a branch of cold fear thread through him and rushes to reassure him. \u201cBut you didn\u2019t,\u201d he says. Lan Wangji knew how he\u2019d react, how he\u2019d never forgive himself, so he hadn\u2019t thrust that upon him. \u201cLook, I\u2019m not mad,\u201d he says. \u201cAh, this makes things better\u2014we\u2019ll live together, we\u2019ll die together, we\u2019ll cultivate together. Shall we get married?\u201d he says, grinning.</p>\n<p>The surge of enthusiasm almost knocks him over and Wei Wuxian collapses in laughter, looping his arms around Lan Wangji in delight.</p>\n<p>It won\u2019t be quite that easy\u2014not a happily ever after, not for a long time at least. They\u2019ll have to get used to this so Wei Wuxian doesn\u2019t collapse under the sheer weight of Lan Wangji\u2019s intense emotions, get used to their cultivating so they don't risk qi deviation. There\u2019s still Jiang Cheng to find, YunMengJiang to avenge. They can\u2019t allow the Wen Sect to continue this way\u2014it will hurt too many people, and Wen Chao will still be looking for them.</p>\n<p>But for now, Lan Wangji\u2019s eyes are golden and warm, and Wei Wuxian can feel everything in him\u2014the worry he still holds for his missing brother and the remainder of his sect, the suppressed frustration he hadn\u2019t been able to save his father, the other disciples, the library of the GusuLan, that it had taken him too long to find Wei Wuxian\u2014but along all of it is a deep undercurrent of contentment and affection and joy\u2014of love.</p>\n<p>Wei Wuxian takes that lovely, expressionless face in his hands, and he can read every minute clue now\u2014the faintest curve of his brow, the twitch of his cheek, the bow of his lips, the gaze of his eyes\u2014and wonders how he never noticed them before. \u201cLan Zhan, you\u2019re so good. You\u2019re the best. I like you so much, Lan Zhan.\u201d The more he speaks, the happier he feels like an endless loop cycling between him and Lan Wangji in infinity.</p>\n<p>For now, they\u2019re golden.</p>"
