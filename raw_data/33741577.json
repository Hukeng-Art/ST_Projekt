  "text": "<p>\n<span>Life continues on, beautiful and kind, fate singing of serenity and calmness.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>A fate that cannot last, not when a teacher like Shouta Aizawa chose a student like Izuku Midoriya to be his son in all but blood.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Still, the students of 1-A appreciate this reprieve, however minor it may be, the day beginning with a peace that can only be known when Izuku Midoriya walks into class long before the bell rings, an entire ten minutes before, happily talking to his peers without any oddities, any changes that would imply a personality swapping assignment.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>And perhaps this is because of the last few weeks, the chaos that Midoriya has brought with the advice of his mentors, two of them encouraging, reveling in the mischief that Midoriya can cause, the last a silent supporter, even when the swaps leave him quaking. To be a boy trained personally by what 1-A can only consider to be the greatest Underground Hero they\u2019ve ever known, Aizawa, the mastermind that is Nedzu himself, and the once Number One Hero in Japan, the man who will forever be the Symbol of Peace, All Might...it is no wonder that \u2018normal\u2019 is not a word that can encompass the routine of a boy such as Midoriya.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Yet despite this knowledge, this inescapable truth of life, Midoriya sits around just like the rest of them, content as he talks with some of his friends. Shouto Todoroki sits closest of them all, having moved his chair to be beside his friend. Hitoshi Shinsou leans up against his own desk, with Ochako Uraraka perched on top of his desk. Tsuyu Asui and Tenya Iida stand nearby, the two on either side of Todoroki\u2019s chair, neither phased by how Todoroki only has eyes for Midoriya.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>It\u2019s how it\u2019s been for months, after all.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>And this is another fact that is unavoidable, Todoroki\u2019s endless pining for the green haired boy who blesses their life with kindness and chaos. And while this may not mean that the boy has found the courage to ask out Midoriya- Todoroki does have some self-preservation, after all, Aizawa\u2019s wrath a powerful deterrent, although the rest of the class is beginning to see it fade away rather quickly, the dual-haired boy far too enamored with the greenet to simply stay a friend forever, to simply stay away without at least asking for the boy\u2019s hand and risking Aizawa\u2019s fury- well, it certainly does not stop the boy from wanting to hear about Midoriya for hours on end...or perhaps simply hear Midoriya speak for hours.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Nonetheless, it means that a conversation that was once about simple school assignments and plans for the night, all simple ones, with it only being Wednesday, shifts quickly into something else entirely, with Todoroki bringing up Midoriya as the topic to focus on.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cDo you think that Aizawa will give you a new assignment tomorrow or Friday?\u201d Todoroki asks, speaking the very moment that Uraraka ends her excited tangent over her plans to make mochi with Satou, lessons that the chef had promised to finally provide. Midoriya blinks at the sudden change, attention shifting from the now amused Uraraka to the patiently waiting Todoroki. He is the only one caught off guard, the rest unsurprised by this shift, only letting it be, knowing that Todoroki\u2019s pining is far too strong to merely push to the side.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>And so Midoriya\u2019s acting once again takes the stage, despite the boy not even acting for the day, the actor shrugging his shoulders before speaking.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOh, well...I\u2019m not sure, actually. Aizawa might be giving me a break for the week. He does like to tone it down some, when I have bigger projects recently completed.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cLike how you acted as Fat Gum last week, </span>\n<em>\n<span>kero</span>\n</em>\n<span>,\u201d Asui notes, and Midoriya nods.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cExactly.\u201d Hand running through his hair, Midoriya admits, \u201cThat one was harder than I expected. I was sore for days from Mimic.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI think Kirishima cried when you complimented him,\u201d Uraraka says, and then pauses. \u201cNo, yeah, he definitely cried.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to do that,\u201d Midoriya says. \u201cIt just felt like the proper way to react. Kirishima did really well that day!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAnd shed more tears than you,\u201d Shinsou agrees, and Midoriya flushes red.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYour raid with Aizawa is another reason that you are likely being given a break, is it not?\u201d Iida asks, kind enough to push the conversation forwards, and Midoriya nods, eager to have something other than his own tears to talk about.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou mean the one where they took down the entire League of Villains?\u201d Shinsou asks, the rhetorical question dry yet amused. \u201cThe very group that has been plaguing you guys since the first week?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cMaybe Monoma was right,\u201d Uraraka muses. \u201cMaybe you </span>\n<em>\n<span>are</span>\n</em>\n<span> too powerful, Deku.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI\u2019m not, I-\u201d Midoriya turns bright red, face hitting the table as he tries to hide it. \u201cI only fought a few members. I wasn\u2019t that special.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cJust special enough that you were the only first year to go on the raid,\u201d Asui agrees, a hint of teasing in her voice, and Midoriya makes a noise of protest.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cMimic gave them the information they needed, I-\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cDidn\u2019t you also use Rewind on Kurogiri?\u201d Todoroki asks, and Midoriya whips his head up.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhere did you </span>\n<em>\n<span>hear</span>\n</em>\n<span> about that?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cJirou overheard Aizawa bragging about you and Eri,\u201d Shinsou says.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cA rather parental move, if you ask me.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Midoriya sputters. \u201cI- he-\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThere, there,\u201d Uraraka says, patting Midoriya on the back. \u201cIt\u2019s okay. You\u2019ll see it one day.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAizawa doesn\u2019t think of me as his </span>\n<em>\n<span>kid</span>\n</em>\n<span>,\u201d Midoriya says, a statement that no one in the class of 1-A could ever believe except for Midoriya, the boy as oblivious as can be.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cSure,\u201d Shinsou says, voice not showing the slightest hints of belief or sincerity, a fact that Midoriya does manage to pick up on.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou\u2019re not denying that you view him as a dad, though,\u201d Shinsou continues, just as Midoriya opens his mouth, and Midoriya, somehow, manages to make even blushing go Plus Ultra, face turning a shade of scarlet that none of them had ever thought possible.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWe\u2019re going to break him,\u201d Asui notes idly, and Midoriya squeaks in response, perhaps already broken.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cMoving on,\u201d Iida says, once again proving himself to be the saint in Midoriya\u2019s group of friends, \u201cI am curious about that detail of the raid. Midoriya, how were you able to use Rewind so well?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIsn\u2019t Eri still having trouble with her Quirk?\u201d Uraraka asks, also intrigued. \u201cIf you\u2019re getting into character, wouldn\u2019t that mean you\u2019d be bad with Rewind, too?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cEri isn\u2019t bad with her Quirk!\u201d Midoriya defends instantly. \u201cShe\u2019s been working on controlling Rewind, just as I\u2019ve been working on Mimic. Aizawa has spent a lot of time helping her, and she\u2019s gotten really far in such a short period of time. It\u2019s incredible, really, and-\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOkay, big brother,\u201d Shinsou teases. \u201cSo her experience transferred over to you?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cKind of,\u201d Midoriya responds. \u201cBut I\u2019ve been practicing getting into character a lot, so that I could also help her with her Quirk. Rewind is one of the Quirks I\u2019ve dealt with most, actually.\u201d Midoriya pauses, and then admits, \u201cErasure is also at the top.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThat\u2019s so cute!\u201d Uraraka says.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou must feel safest with those Quirks,\u201d Todoroki says, and Midoriya nods. \u201cThat makes sense. They are the Quirks of your little sister and father, after all.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cTodoroki!\u201d Midoriya yelps, and then his phone dings, instantly cutting off any rebuttal that the boy may have had.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Midoriya blinks slowly, then reaches down, pulling his phone out of his pocket and checking the notification.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIt\u2019s from Nedzu,\u201d Midoriya says, unlocking his phone and opening the message. \u201cMaybe he\u2019s cancelling today\u2019s lesson...oh.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhat does it say?\u201d Asui asks, and Midoriya reads it out loud.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cEnjoy the chaos, Kan was being far too dismissive and Aizawa decided it was time to make a bet. Huh. I wonder what that could be about.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>And just like that, the bell rings and the door slams open.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>And Aizawa walks in, eyes glinting in a way that hints of chaos soon to come.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cFollow me, hell class,\u201d Aizawa says, no other greeting coming from his lips. \u201cWe\u2019re about to go embarrass Vlad in front of his students.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>And what else can 1-A do except follow?</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>And so follow is what they do, a class full of confusion and excitement, unsure of where the day will head from there, but ready to see it through nonetheless.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Oh, the things they will see, in just a few moments time\u2026</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>-----</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Izuku Midoriya isn\u2019t sure what he expected, when Aizawa came into the room so suddenly, but it wasn\u2019t to be led to the gyms, where multiple of the Yuuei teachers would already be standing, all at various levels of excitement- one in particular looking more smug than excited, but a show of eagerness nonetheless.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>And it definitely was not for Nedzu to pop up from behind a table, waving in order to catch Izuku\u2019s attention.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cMidoriya!\u201d Nedzu chirped. \u201cAnd let us see...ah, yes! Todoroki, Shinsou, and Bakugou, if you\u2019ll please!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Izuku blinks, surprised by the sudden call of his name, but the moment he sees Katsuki move forwards, he doesn\u2019t hesitate to do the same, Shinsou and Todoroki only a few steps behind them.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cGood morning,\u201d Nedzu says. \u201cPlease, come and take a seat, why won\u2019t you?\u201d Nedzu gestures to the table, where Izuku quickly notes there are five chairs placed perfectly in a row, coordinated and planned.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNedzu?\u201d Izuku asks, rather than listening to his mentor. \u201cWhat are we doing?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Nedzu grins, something sharp and animalistic and far too familiar, a need for chaos clamped tightly in those jaws. \u201cWhy, I\u2019m glad you asked!\u201d Nedzu says, and then he is turning, positioning himself so that he can address both the group before him, and the mass of that is the rest of 1-A mixed with the entirety of 1-B.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cToday, the teachers before you will be acting as our very own Izuku Midoriya! As Midoriya\u2019s only mentor that is not participating, I will act as one of five judges. Todoroki, Shinsou, and Bakugou, as three of Midoriya\u2019s closest friends, who would know him best either from recent times or those past, you have also been selected as judges. Midoriya, you are the final judge, as you will know which consistencies and inconsistencies to look for, their assignment being yourself! Any questions?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cCan we get this fucking thing started?\u201d Bakugou asks, and Nedzu claps his paws together.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAbsolutely! Actors, to your places! Judges, with me, if you will be so kind.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Izuku glances at the now much more intrigued group of students, and then at the teachers who wait for their chance to perform. He takes a deep breath, lets it out.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>And takes his spot.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>He takes the center seat, the only one with a name marked on it. Nedzu is quick to hop into the one on his right, and Todoroki sits to his left. Shinsou sits beside Todoroki, and Katsuki slides into the final spot, which rests on Nedzu\u2019s other side.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Izuku notices that Katsuki seems oddly...stiff, sitting beside the principal. He wonders why that is.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>But it\u2019s not his place to ask, and Nedzu seems to take no offense to this abnormal behavior, if anything looking rather pleased by this show of discomfort, so Izuku chooses to turn a blind eye to the oddity.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Instead, Izuku looks at the teachers, takes them all in. There\u2019s Aizawa, of course, the one who had brought them here. And then there is Vlad King, which makes sense, considering the text that Nedzu had sent him just a few moments ago. Yamada\u2019s presence isn\u2019t all too surprising, given how much Izuku\u2019s assignments have affected the man- and how eager Yamada was to play along during Izuku\u2019s time as the blond himself- and neither is Yagi\u2019s appearance, Nedzu having already pointed out that he was the only one of Izuku\u2019s mentors </span>\n<em>\n<span>not</span>\n</em>\n<span> acting today.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>And so there are four actors, all waiting, some more patiently than others.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Waiting for their chance to begin.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>And who is Izuku, to stop a performance from occurring? It goes against his very nature, does it not?</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>It does, because if Izuku is one thing he is an actor, his Quirk and Aizawa\u2019s influence having made sure of this fact of life, and so Izuku looks to Nedzu for guidance before looking back to the teachers.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\"You can begin,\" Izuku says, and so they do.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>They do not come up all at once. No, instead they go one by one, giving Izuku, his friends, and Nedzu the chance to judge them more thoroughly, to analyze their actions and scrutinize their decisions.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>And Hizashi Yamada is the first to take the metaphorical stage.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Izuku watches the man step forwards, shoulders carefully loose of tension, smile especially bright. There is no sign of something more sinister, no hint of hurt hidden underneath the surface. There is only joy, only happiness, showing on Yamada\u2019s face.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHe\u2019s only playing your happiest side,\u201d Todoroki says, just moments after Izuku has realized the very same, before the man in question has even spoken.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>And when Yamada speaks, Izuku knows that this assumption is correct.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Because when Yamada speaks, he does so with excitement, nothing hesitant in the way he leans forwards and says, \u201cGood morning, guys! Aizawa hasn\u2019t given me an assignment today, but I think he has one planned soon. I\u2019m pretty sure I know what it is, too- but no hints! That\u2019s cheating!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Izuku gets the feeling that he now understands how his peers felt, the first time he did an assignment on his own, that second day of his swaps. To see only one person playing a role...and for it to be himself, specifically...yeah, he gets why it threw his classmates for a loop.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>And it is all the stranger when it is his teacher doing the acting.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Izuku shakes his head, pushing thoughts of oddities to the side and simply allowing himself to enjoy his English teacher\u2019s attempt, noting vague disparities and listening to the comments that his friends and tea-loving mentor offer.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Because each of them has something to offer, when Yamada does something that sparks their interest. Todoroki had said his piece before Yamada could even truly begin, but the other three are also eager to point out differences, taking their roles to heart.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou\u2019ve never been a showoff with your English,\u201d Katsuki chides when Yamada begins to sing a song from Hamilton, undoubtedly a reference to Izuku\u2019s impersonation of the blond. \u201cYou only let people know when you had a reason to.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHe\u2019s only showing a piece of you,\u201d Shinsou says, right as Yamada reaches the end of his turn. \u201cOnly your joy. Where\u2019s the rest?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou mean the anxiety?\u201d Izuku murmurs, and Shinsou snorts.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAnxiety, protectiveness, need to cause eternal chaos...any of it, yeah.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI do quite miss the chaos,\u201d Nedzu agrees somberly. \u201cAnd while Yamada is trying rather hard to mimic you, he is missing most of your body language. You\u2019re rather\u2026\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cJittery,\u201d Katsuki offers, and Izuku sputters.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThat is one way to put it,\u201d Nedzu agrees, polite but damning. \u201cYour energy simply likes to leak through your skin, Midoriya.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou vibrate,\u201d Todoroki consolidates. \u201cIt\u2019s when you\u2019re excited, too, so Yamada missed it either way.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Izuku sighs, then thanks Yamada when the man drops the act, letting the man walk off to the side. Internally, he decides that Yamada did rather well, if only a little too focused on one aspect of himself.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>And then Toshinori Yagi walks up, and Izuku realizes that his mentor isn\u2019t much better about that very same issue.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>It\u2019s not for a lack of trying, Izuku is sure, but rather a matter of perception. Because Izuku is Yagi\u2019s successor, has been the Symbol of Peace\u2019s prot\u00e9g\u00e9 long before his swaps, long before Aizawa or Nedzu ever even thought to have an interest in him. He is the ninth to Yagi\u2019s eighth, another name in a legacy that is made of generations of power.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>To Yagi, Izuku is young Midoriya. To Yagi, Izuku is his boy, his successor, the next Symbol in the making, or perhaps just another sharer of a Quirk that binds more than blood ever could- ironic, considering that DNA still had to be passed, for such a power to be inherited. To Yagi, Izuku is something like a successor, </span>\n<strike>\n<span>something like a son</span>\n</strike>\n<span>, and undeniably someone that Yagi knows well, who Yagi has every right to believe that he would know better than most. He is, after all, one of the few that knows the secret of One for All, having been the one to pass the knowledge off to Izuku.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Izuku will never deny that there is a bond between himself and his mentor. There has to be, for Yagi to have stuck by his side through everything, to have taken pride in a boy once thought Quirkless, and to stay with him in support when it was revealed that Izuku was much more than that timid Quirkless boy that Yagi had picked and trained, had raised to be someone that could reach for his dreams and take them.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Izuku is something quite different, and his bond with Yagi can make the very same claim, and so it is of no surprise to Izuku that Yagi perceives him in a way that captures his persona...but doesn\u2019t quite grasp it.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Because perception is a beauty and a burden, and one\u2019s perception of another can warp their entire understanding of a person, of their personality.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>And Yagi sees him in a light that is not cruel, no, but it is in one tinged with nostalgia and the months that were just the two of them, an Izuku that was but no longer quite </span>\n<em>\n<span>is</span>\n</em>\n<span>.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>And so Izuku has to sit in his seat, and feel both flattered that Yagi- that All Might himself, the hero that Izuku spent hours as a child watching on loop- is willing to take the time to act as him as part of this competition...and force down the urge to mimic Todoroki so that he can burst into flames, because Yagi\u2019s main part of the performance focuses on how quickly Izuku\u2019s emotions can shift. And that\u2019s great, truly! It\u2019s a sign that Yagi can perceive multiple aspects of his character, and can tie them together, which is already better than Yamada\u2019s attempt to merely focus on his cheerful side.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>But it\u2019s mainly just his crying that Yagi ends up emphasizing. Well, that and his fanboy tendencies, which Izuku can </span>\n<em>\n<span>fully</span>\n</em>\n<span> admit that he has, and was especially bad about when first training with his mentor- and who can </span>\n<em>\n<span>blame</span>\n</em>\n<span> him, really?- but that doesn\u2019t quite mean that he wants them broadcasted to the entire first year hero department...and by one of his greatest idols, no less.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>And yet Yagi is beaming when he drops the act, so sure of himself, so proud, that Izuku can\u2019t bring himself to do anything except offer his mentor a thumbs up and a grin that the blond matches instantly before walking off, the man rather pleased and far too oblivious to Izuku\u2019s quickly reddening face.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>A warmth that only gets worse when his friends turn to him, each wearing looks that speak of mischief and delight intertwined.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cSpot on,\u201d Katsuki says, the little shit that he always has been. \u201cI doubt either of the others can top that. Ten out of ten, or whatever.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWe\u2019re no longer friends,\u201d Izuku mutters, and Katsuki snorts.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAs if,\u201d Katsuki retorts, and, well, Izuku doesn\u2019t have an actual rebuttal for that.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHe was better than Yamada,\u201d Shinsou offers, but his smile is still a bit too cheeky for Izuku\u2019s liking. \u201cHonestly, he reminds me of how you were before the swaps.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Izuku nods, pushing his embarrassment aside to respond. \u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d Izuku agrees. \u201cIf I had never started doing the assignments, I probably would be more like that still.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAs if you\u2019ve changed that much,\u201d Katsuki says. \u201cYou\u2019ve just picked up a spine that sticks around, you\u2019re still the same brat I grew up with.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Izuku blinks, then smiles. \u201cIs that a compliment?\u201d He asks, and Katsuki sputters.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHow the </span>\n<em>\n<span>fuck</span>\n</em>\n<span> was that a compliment?\u201d Katsuki asks, and Shinsou nods.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThat was definitely a compliment.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Todoroki hums, and Izuku turns to look at his friend. \u201cBakugou is right. You\u2019re still you, Midoriya. You haven\u2019t become drastically different since the beginning of the year...you\u2019ve just grown into yourself more, I think.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Izuku smiles at the words, touched. \u201cThanks, Todoroki! That\u2019s really sweet.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOf course,\u201d Todoroki says, and Izuku tries not to overthink the pink tint that shows on his friend\u2019s face. \u201cAlthough it\u2019s not just me who sees it. Clearly, your original dad sees it as well.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOriginal\u2026\u201d Izuku pouts. \u201cTodoroki! Yagi isn\u2019t my dad!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAnd neither is Aizawa,\u201d Todoroki says, as if implying the opposite, to which Izuku sputters even more.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYes!\u201d Izuku says, and is met with not one, not two, but four sighs from the rest of the table, causing him to whip around. \u201cWhat? What am I missing?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cBoth of your dads, apparently,\u201d Katsuki mutters, but then Nedzu is clapping his paws together.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAlright! Vlad King, if you\u2019ll please!\u201d Nedzu calls out, and Izuku blinks.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI\u2019m surprised Vlad King isn\u2019t going last,\u201d Izuku admits. \u201cI would have thought that Aizawa wanted to show his own act before, to embarrass Vlad.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIt\u2019ll be more embarrassing after,\u201d Shinsou says. \u201cEspecially if Vlad sucks.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>And Shinsou is right...because while Izuku thought Yagi was decent, and Yamada was okay...Vlad doesn\u2019t even deserve last.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Is it petty to wish to give someone a lower ranking than there were competitors? Izuku isn\u2019t sure, but watching the 1-B homeroom teacher take his entire personality and do the metaphorical equivalent of throwing it in sewage, Izuku is willing to forgo niceties for this case.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Vlad King, Izuku quickly realizes, has no idea what Izuku is like, or what he represents. It\u2019s understandable, Izuku supposes, considering that the man teaches 1-B, and not 1-A, and therefore would have much more limited knowledge on him compared to his teachers.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>But Vlad King should still have </span>\n<em>\n<span>some</span>\n</em>\n<span> knowledge, especially thanks to the more recent months that have passed. Months of acting assignments, of Izuku going around the school, from 1-A to 1-B to support, from being heroes from Yuuei to those of other schools, or just ones without any teaching jobs at all...Izuku has even been</span>\n<em>\n<span> villains</span>\n</em>\n<span>! Izuku has put himself in Vlad King\u2019s vicinity so many times by now, has given the man many chances to see him and analyze his character, if only Vlad took the time to look back and remember.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>And yet it\u2019s clear, from the moment that Vlad King opens his mouth, that the man has dismissed the past entirely, creating a character for Izuku based only on his beliefs and the acts that Yamada and Yagi have put on.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Quite honestly, Izuku cannot tell what the worst part is. But if he had to narrow it down, it would either be the very beginning, where Vlad King took Izuku\u2019s acting as an implication that Izuku is an overly confident boy with no anxiety whatsoever- a world Izuku could never dream of existing in, his stress too perpetual and undoubtedly trying to give him white hairs before his second year even begins- or the end, where Vlad sees the disappointed looks from the blonds that had already gone, and completely changes his act.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Giving Izuku part two of the crybaby Izuku series.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOh what the </span>\n<em>\n<span>fuck</span>\n</em>\n<span>,\u201d Izuku mutters, and Shinsou stifles a laugh under his breath, disguising it with a cough.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Traitor.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Even Monoma seems disappointed in his teacher by the time that the man finally stops, and Izuku is pretty sure that that says quite a lot about the performance. Izuku watches as Vlad King walks away, smug and self-assured, and then turns to his friends and mentors.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIs that how you guys see me?\u201d Izuku asks, and his friends shake their heads immediately.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHe\u2019s just shit at acting,\u201d Katsuki confirms, and Izuku lets out a sigh of relief when even Nedzu agrees with the sentiment.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThank kami...okay, let\u2019s finish this.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>And then Izuku can pretend that his entire state of being wasn\u2019t reduced to an act like </span>\n<em>\n<span>that</span>\n</em>\n<span>.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Aizawa steps up to the center, and Izuku watches eagerly, waiting to see what his final mentor will do.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>He\u2019s not disappointed.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>No, Izuku is not disappointed in the slightest. Rather, Izuku finds himself leaning forwards, delighted as he watches Aizawa rub at his eyes before slipping into character, posture shifting from slouched shoulders and a subtle lean into something both more excitable and more nervous, back straightening and hands slipping out of pockets to show that they are half-clenched, as if unsure whether to ball up or flatten out. Aizawa smiles, and it doesn\u2019t look quite right on his face, but he lifts one of his hands to run through his hair, brushing the strands back, and oh, that\u2019s a move Izuku does quite often, isn\u2019t it?</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>But Aizawa goes further than physical movements, words precise and perfectly picked, sounding quite like Izuku as he questions why Nedzu has called for him, if there\u2019s another assignment, even going into a miniature muttering spree as he tries to guess who his next assignment will be.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYour dads are so spot on,\u201d Shinsou says, and Izuku can\u2019t even tear his focus away long enough to get flustered by the title once again.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>And Izuku could go on, could ramble endlessly about how fascinating it is, seeing his homeroom teacher pick out his little tells and apply them seamlessly. He could theorize on if the feeling is similar to how his teachers have felt, seeing him do the exact same thing. The precision of it all is surprising and inspiring, and Izuku has to ignore the urge to join his teacher and start acting as well, the call to put on a show annoyingly great.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Izuku could go on, yes, but for once...for once, it feels best to leave the words unspoken, to let the actions simply be enjoyed and appreciated.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>And so Izuku keeps his mouth shut, only speaking once Aizawa is finished.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHe wins,\u201d Izuku says, and not a soul disagrees.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>And so Aizawa takes first in the miniature competition, Yagi claiming second and Yamada content with third.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>And Vlad King stuck with the knowledge that acting is quite a bit harder than it seems.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>And all is well with the world, just as it should be.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>And Izuku is content. Flustered, embarrassed, and appreciated, and content despite, or perhaps because, of it all.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>(The day continues, something quite calm until the end.)</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>-----</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Shouta Aizawa is content at the end of the day, when the bell rings and his students are eager to race out of the room, ready to head back to the dorms so that they can relax before getting their homework done. Shouta is happy enough to stand up and do the same, gathering his papers easily enough, ready to head back to his on-campus apartment. It\u2019s a building shared by all of the teachers, a place that Eri is happy to reside in, which is more than enough for Shouta\u2019s approval. It gives her a chance to acclimate to the company of others, and allows Shouta to have his colleagues watch over her when he cannot, without putting any of them out of their way.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>It\u2019s their main place of residence, although Shouta often has them stay in the 1-A dorms, too, an apartment of their own located within the walls of Heights Alliance. His class finds chaos easily enough on their own, after all, without Shouta's influence coming into play. Whether it be clumsy mistakes made by teenagers who have never lived in dorms before this year, or villains attacking, or secrets with lifespans of over two hundred years being admitted by his resident Problem Child, Shouta is often around to make sure that he can help his students through whatever dilemma comes up.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>And he never regrets it, even if it means missing sleep, even if it means going back and forth between his different apartments.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Not when it means that he is there for his class.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>But today, Shouta is not staying in the 1-A dorms. He has patrol tonight, which means that he will stay in the teachers\u2019 apartments, so that Eri is near other adults should she need anything in the night, when Shouta is gone and his students should be asleep. She\u2019s been sleeping easier, ever since the most recent raid, her confidence having spiked with the successful use of Rewind on Shouta\u2019s high school friend.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Shouta smiles at the reminder of this good news, at Oboro\u2019s return. The boy is back, if still the age that he had been when gone. Their friendship will never be the same, no, too much time has passed...but he is glad that his once close friend has a chance to continue the life Shouta knew he would want.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Shouta got the chance to visit him, just the other day. He was reunited with his parents as soon as he was awake and considered stable, no side effects from everything that had happened to him, fortunately.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<span>\u201cThere\u2019s so much to do!\u201d Oboro had said, and yet he had looked thrilled by the admittance. \u201cShouta, it\u2019s so strange! Everything has changed so much, and I\u2019m the only one catching up to what everyone else views as normal. I feel like a kid in some manga, having been sent to the future. Is this what time travel feels like? It\u2019s kind of cool, let me tell you.\u201d</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Shouta will take Oboro\u2019s word for it, and he let the boy know exactly that.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>He thinks Eri will like to meet him. Maybe in the next few weeks, when they have the time.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Maybe Midoriya would like to go, too. Midoriya was one of the key forces behind the entire raid, after all, the reason they knew to do everything in the first place.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>And maybe Shouta just wants to let Oboro meet both of his kids, to prove Oboro wrong. They had joked, when they were younger, that Shouta would only ever have cats for children.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>And now Shouta has two that he calls his own, one of which he has adopted, one of which he happily would.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>One who is approaching him, forcing Shouta out of his thoughts with a hesitantly asked, \u201cAizawa?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYes, Problem Child?\u201d Shouta asks, and Midoriya gives him an odd look.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou\u2019ve been staring at that paper for quite a while.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAh.\u201d A glance at the clock lets him know that a few minutes have already passed, a look around the room shows that Midoriya is the only one left in the room. \u201cI was thinking of something, thank you.\u201d\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Midoriya nods, looking pleased, and only starts to leave the room when Shouta does the same. He seems content enough, just walking beside Shouta, and Shouta hides his smile at this fact, at the way that his kid is at ease with his company.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>And yet Shouta is confused, because, \u201cProblem Child, it\u2019s Wednesday.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYep!\u201d Midoriya agrees easily enough, causing Shouta to blink slowly, lost.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cDon\u2019t you have lessons with Nedzu today?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOh, not today,\u201d Midoriya says. \u201cHe said that my analysis of you all this morning was enough work, and told me to enjoy a break.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThat\u2019s good,\u201d Shouta says. \u201cYou should do that.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI will,\u201d Midoriya agrees. \u201cTodoroki actually asked me if I want to leave campus for a bit, maybe grab something to eat. I was wondering if I could bring Eri with us- I know she loves this one cafe nearby, and Todoroki said she was welcome to join if you approved.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Shouta hums. If Eri comes, it\u2019s not a date, even if the idea sounds far too much like one otherwise.\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>But Midoriya seems far too excited by the idea, and it would be good for Eri to go with them so that she can get out more\u2026</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u2018</span>\n<em>\n<span>Todoroki knows exactly what he\u2019s doing,</span>\n</em>\n<span>\u2019 Shouta realizes with a scowl, and yet he can\u2019t help but be impressed. At least his student is smart about it, if not clever enough that Shouta won\u2019t catch on.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou can go,\u201d Shouta agrees. \u201cJust make sure to be back by eight, so that Eri isn\u2019t up too long.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOf course! The teachers\u2019 apartments tonight, sensei?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYes.\u201d Shouta smiles, then adds, \u201cThank you. Eri enjoys spending time with you.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI enjoy spending time with her, too!\u201d Midoriya responds immediately. \u201cShe\u2019s like a little sister to me.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>And Midoriya is constantly referred to as her older brother, a habit that has only increased since it\u2019s first appearance in December. Shouta wonders if Midoriya knows that this habit has not stopped, but doubts that the boy would mind.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Instead he lets the topic drop, letting Midoriya steer its course instead. And Midoriya picks up the slack soon enough, asking, \u201cWhy did you guys do the acting assignment, anyways? I understand that Vlad King was being somewhat dismissive of my acting, but for so many of you to act as me...was there a reason?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cSometimes, the best way to prove a point is to show the opposition how wrong they were,\u201d Shouta says easily. \u201cIn this case, it was showing Vlad that he was being foolish and ignorant.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWell, you were really good at acting! Is it because you\u2019re an Underground Hero?\u201d Midoriya asks. \u201cThat makes sense...you\u2019ve probably had to infiltrate groups, which would require a persona of your own...you never mentioned that you could act!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIt\u2019s nothing as exciting as your acts,\u201d Shouta brushes off. \u201cI\u2019ve done a few infiltrations, but nothing as elaborate as your swaps.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u2018</span>\n<em>\n<span>Besides,</span>\n</em>\n<span>\u2019 Shouta thinks. \u2018</span>\n<em>\n<span>It\u2019s rather easy to imitate the kid I view as my own. If I had to be Bakugou...no.</span>\n</em>\n<span>\u2019</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Shouta blinks when he notices that Midoriya has gone silent, and then realizes that the boy has stopped following. He turns around, sees Midoriya staring right back, face turning red.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou think of me as your own?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Shouta blinks again, but Midoriya fills in the silence.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou said that out loud. You didn\u2019t mean to, did you? Wait, does that mean Shinsou and Todoroki </span>\n<em>\n<span>weren\u2019t</span>\n</em>\n<span> joking? But- but why me?\u201d He doesn\u2019t seem upset by the realization, just confused, which is a reaction that Shouta hadn\u2019t expected, either.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhy not?\u201d Shouta asks.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cBecause it\u2019s me,\u201d Midoriya says. \u201cYou know what I\u2019m like.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cExactly,\u201d Shouta agrees. \u201cYou\u2019re my Problem Child, who was Quirkless for most of his life yet pushed through the shit life threw at you because of it. You\u2019re my student who has managed to gain control over two Quirks, one over a decade late to reveal itself, and one that has the power of centuries behind it. You\u2019re the kid who managed to turn out as the personification of heroism, despite all that you\u2019ve had to go through. Why wouldn\u2019t I want to consider you my kid?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cReally?\u201d Midoriya asks, voice shaky and unsure but eyes shining with tears and something that looks quite like hope. \u201cYou- you think all of that?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cReally,\u201d Shouta assures. \u201cYou are my kid, and have been for quite some time.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cEven though I\u2019m not actually your kid, like Eri is?\u201d Midoriya asks, and Shouta nods.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>And Midoriya bursts into tears, surging into Shouta\u2019s arms, barely giving the man time to brace himself before his kid is crying into his chest. Shouta doesn\u2019t hesitate to wrap his arms around the boy, offering him the comfort that his kid needs.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI always wanted a dad,\u201d Midoriya murmurs, and Shouta\u2019s heart both breaks for his son and fills because of him.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>(And the conversation continues from there, a father and his son held together by bonds not made by blood nor paper but by choice, by a fate that was created from threads that have been stitched together, a fate that was realigned for the sake of both parties in question.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The conversation continues, and so does life, beautiful and hopeful in all of its glory.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>And fate carries on, singing sweetly of good to come.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>A song of family and love, and all that comes with it.)</span>\n</p>"
