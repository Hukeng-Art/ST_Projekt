  "text": "<p>The trouble with poets is that they\u2019re <em>liars</em>, all of them, every last Darjeeling-drinking, Parliament-smoking twat scribbling down their rose-colored witticisms in Parisian caf\u00e9s, drenching entire stanzas purple with deception and dishonesty for innocent young eyeballs like Sirius Black\u2019s to read and get the impression that life works anything at all the way Auden tells you it will. They ought to be locked up, quills snapped, publicly denounced on the steps of the Ministry.</p>\n<p><em>Innocent</em>. See, he can do it too.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s in the middle of one of these scathing internal monologues at the Hog\u2019s Head on a November night when the rain can\u2019t decide whether it wants to be snow and Peter can\u2019t decide whether he wants to be companionably drunk or lit as a firecracker at New Year\u2019s when James catches his eyes from across the table, the same eyes that have strayed, as they so often do, to the source of at least sixty-five of his current frustrations: Remus Lupin and the curl of his long fingers, the wry twist of his lips, the scar smoothed into the cut of his jaw, tapering off beneath his chin. James smiles, slow and self-satisfied; Sirius\u2019 small intestine heaves sharply to the left.</p>\n<p>And this\u2014<em>this</em> is how he knows that every single poet Remus has ever left dog-eared and tattered on the coffee table is a miserable con, because the world never ends with a bang or a whimper or even an awkward, embarrassed stutter. That would be too dignified.</p>\n<p>The world ends with James Potter leaning across the table as Remus helps Peter totter to the fireplace, elbows pressing into the table and that smug glint of mischief flashing deep in the backs of his dark eyes, as if he\u2019s finally caught what he\u2019s been fishing for all this time and wants to fillet it right here on the table.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey,\u201d says The End, low, unsubtle as anything, \u201ccan I ask you something?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u2014</p>\n<p>In a certain corner of Sirius\u2019 broad and spacious closet, kept pristine among entire encyclopedias stacked chaotically from floor to ceiling and bulging with the gory details of every stupid thing he\u2019s ever done and how much he still loves his arsehole brother, there is a thick, musty-smelling volume with notes stuffed into the margins and a spine creased with the weight of years, its edges tea-stained, time-soft. It slides in neatly between the tattered old <em>Fuck You, Mum</em> and <em>Extreme Sexual Confusion, Vol. 12</em>, and its name is <em>Remus Lupin</em>.</p>\n<p>If you could sift through those rumpled pages, you\u2019d find expert analysis on the state of Remus Lupin\u2019s hair sticking up at impossible angles when he wakes up in the mornings contrasted with how it floofs up mightily in the humidity, and the way those things correlate to the twinging of Sirius\u2019 insides. There are charts dedicated to which mismatched socks make him look like a plonker and which ones make Sirius want to kiss him, or both. Lengthy, furious diatribes on all the fights they\u2019ve had. Graphic descriptions of the exact manner Remus\u2019 smiles unfurl dusty-warm across his face, which ones crinkle his eyes, which ones are full of teeth, which ones Sirius put there. Paragraphs about his eyes flecked with gold in the muzzy yellow of the morning sun with the moon finally on the wane, falling always on Sirius. Various attempts to capture his many, many different laughs\u2014dignified, undignified, thrilled and secret, surprised and sweet. The turbulence caused above and below the belt when Remus smokes. The sheer, undiluted joy on his face when he\u2019s shoveling shepherd\u2019s pie into it.</p>\n<p>Only a few hearts, tucked away near the binding.</p>\n<p>And it\u2019s not as if any of this is Remus\u2019 doing; if Sirius is honest with himself\u2014and he mostly is, except where it concerns his seventh-year Potions exam and certain heaps of human-shaped ooze whose names rhyme with Schmivellus Grape\u2014there hasn\u2019t been a single moment in the last five years when he thought he was A Straight Man for more than eight seconds. Girls are lovely and fun and he knows, mostly, what to do with them, though his few bumbling, adolescent gropes with Mary Macdonald in a third-floor broom cupboard left him feeling sticky and vaguely dissatisfied. Boys, though\u2014beyond a few drunken and not-so-drunken snogs with James all throughout school and thinking, <em>Yeah, I\u2019d be down if you asked</em> every time he\u2019s near Kingsley Shacklebolt, he\u2019s not quite sure how it works. If he likes them as much as girls, or more, or <em>entirely</em> more.</p>\n<p>Thinking about it too hard tends to give him stomachaches. For as much as Wizarding society has always been adamant about making no distinction between who is sticking whose bits where and how often or who is marrying who, the fact is, distinctions are made; it\u2019s still not something people are enormously open about even now in the dregs of 1979 with old wossface yowling <em>Let\u2019s spend the night together!</em>, uncensored, and on puritan Muggle radio at that. And then there\u2019s the literature on the stuff, which\u2014when it\u2019s not being shoved to the side in favor of Oatmeal-Flavored Heterosexual Romance #59271\u2014ends in tragedy roughly half the time, which is incredibly morbid and uncomfortable for a nineeen-year-old young man who really wants to snog another nineteen-year-old young man stupid. It\u2019s almost like they\u2019re trying to tell you something.</p>\n<p>And <em>then</em> there\u2019s Ye Olde Pureblood Society, who really, <em>really</em> don\u2019t care how you\u2019re getting your jollies, but know this: You are still expected to enter into a heterosexual (incestuous) marriage, and you are still expected to have heterosexual (incestuous) sex, and you are still expected to produce heterosexual (incestuous) heirs. If he tries hard enough and really applies himself, he can probably blame this one on his parents, too.</p>\n<p>Unfair as it is, he supposes he ought to feel lucky, especially compared to Muggles; but the thing is, the more he thinks about it, the more confused and upset he gets, and it really is hard to keep feeling grateful for scraps you\u2019re not <em>given</em> so much as you\u2019ve got to rip from someone else\u2019s feast with your own hands, nails and all.</p>\n<p>Mostly, Sirius Black is a confused nineteen-year-old hormone cocktail with an injustice- and Remus-induced stomachache and no one to talk to. The strain is not doing flattering things to his complexion.</p>\n<p>But the real corker here is that, logically, Remus is exactly who he should be talking to, because Remus likes boys\u2014everyone knows Remus likes boys, not that he\u2019s ever done anything about it. It\u2019s <em>Remus</em>, after all.</p>\n<p>For a whole week after James leaned over the table in the Hog\u2019s Head and asked, \u201cSo why aren\u2019t you shagging yet,\u201d and swore sideways he wouldn\u2019t say anything even if one of the Prewett brothers caressed his face and asked him nicely, Sirius tries to bring it up. He tries valiantly, gets as far as, \u201cMoony, how did you\u2014how\u2019d you, uh, how\u2019d you like the way I folded your underwear last night, I really feel like I deserve a \u2018thank you, Mr. Black\u2019 and a week of dinner over here,\u201d and gives up completely.</p>\n<p>He can\u2019t very well talk about <em>Remus</em> with Remus, which is the whole problem. Most of his thoughts and his hopes and his squirmy insides are all bound up in Remus Lupin, inextricably, ceaselessly; no matter how he tries to get it out, everything comes back to Remus in constant frantic orbit. The moon fills up and empties, fans out into the sky; the days get shorter, the snow comes softer, and everything, everything rhymes with <em>Remus Lupin</em>.</p>\n<p>So, in the tumult of confusion and stomachaches and Remus and all the things that wither and turn to clay on his tongue, Sirius says a whole lot of stupid half-things. Things like, \u201cThis is weird. I mean, it\u2019s kind of weird, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p>\n<p>Remus, ballpoint tapping against his cheek, turns from the Muggle newspaper he picked up on the way home and frowns Sirius\u2019 favorite frown, the one with the tiny, lopsided crease between his eyebrows Sirius wants to reach over and smooth out with his thumb. <em>I don\u2019t know what the hell is wrong with you</em>, it says, <em>but I\u2019m awfully fond of you anyway</em>.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d says Remus, drawing it out for the eighth time since breakfast, \u201cit\u2019s not. We do this all the time. Why would you think it\u2019s weird?\u201d</p>\n<p>Probably, he thinks, it\u2019s because most blokes would keep a sofa cushion between them while they do a crossword together\u2014if most blokes actually do things like sit down after dinner and work on crosswords together, which he doubts. He\u2019s sitting so close to Remus he can see the tiny smattering of freckles trailing across his nose; he\u2019s never really thought about it before, this closeness, the spindly shapes gravity has made of them.</p>\n<p>\u201cJust, you know. This,\u201d says Sirius, gesturing vaguely around the sitting room of their rented cottage, a birdhouse of a thing with two cozy bedrooms and a big kitchen window and a few starbursts of flowers Remus keeps in cans on the bookshelf. It\u2019s his\u2014theirs\u2014and he loves it like he\u2019s loved little else, every squeaky tile and warped floorboard, the way they fill up every corner, but everything feels so off-footed and strange now, like his whole equilibrium has slipped out of place and he can\u2019t quite fit it back the way it was. Maybe getting a Christmas tree will help. \u201cAnyway. What do you want for Christmas, and don\u2019t say it\u2019s a book or you\u2019re getting a pony.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSocks and shortbread,\u201d says Remus, still eyeing him with quiet suspicion in the sideways tilt of his head, \u201cand it isn\u2019t even December yet, do we really have to talk about this?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, we bloody well do! Now ask me what I want, where\u2019s your propriety gone, man?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat do you want for Christmas, Sirius?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou know what you can give me,\u201d he answers, grinning like a knife when Remus flushes, finishing mentally with the same thing he\u2019s done for who-knows-how-many years now: <em>You can shag me into the floorboards on Christmas Eve. You can take the rest of my debatable virginity, right under the tree</em>. \u201cI\u2019ll just put a big bow down my trousers, like. You can unwrap me and mount me like a prize swordfish in the sitting room, first thing in the morning.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI thought this was your gift?\u201d Remus\u2019 cheeks are very pink; Sirius wants to kiss them.</p>\n<p>\u201cPlease, Moony. I am the best and biggest gift you\u2019re ever going to get.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShut up,\u201d mutters Remus, pulling his jumper sleeves across his knuckles the way he does when he doesn\u2019t know what else to do with his hands, and Sirius wonders if maybe Remus is sometimes just as confused as he is, even if he\u2019s not standing on the same volatile battleground right now. He\u2019d probably retreat into that same faded red wool jumper like a turtle, head and all, if he could fit; Sirius leans into him, and Remus, like ballast, like always, leans back. \u201cTen-letter word for \u2018lovely\u2019 or \u2018charming,\u2019\u201d he says.</p>\n<p>R-E-M-U-S-L-U-P-I-N, supplies the filthy little man who lives in Sirius\u2019 head. \u201cEnchanting,\u201d he says instead, perching his chin on Remus\u2019 shoulder as he fills it in, and then, \u201cthis is weird.\u201d</p>\n<p>He can feel Remus\u2019 chest expanding, taking in as much oxygen as humanly possible to expel the loudest, weariest sigh ever pushed from nineteen-year-old lungs; there are whole chapters dedicated to that sigh in Sirius Black\u2019s Metaphorical Closet, incoherent, mystified ramblings on its origins followed by thousands of question marks and pages full of both indignation and pride at having evoked it, but he saves himself the trouble of wondering this time and points to the sports section of the Muggle newspaper, where an oiled-looking rugby whatsit with arms like sheer granite is doing something manly and severe with what appears to be a large egg. The women\u2019s team gets a byline and two paragraphs near the bottom of the page, and no photo.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat, there, that\u2019s weird,\u201d he lies, triumphantly. \u201cMuggle women having to play on different teams. What happens if they mix, do the men get crushed between their steely thighs? Is that why it\u2019s all separate?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cProbably not weird to them,\u201d says Remus, sounding mildly irritated at being robbed of his long-and-forever-suffering sigh. \u201cBut Muggle women never get the sort of recognition men do in sport. Actually, some people joke about them.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou know what else is weird?\u201d asks Sirius, bravely, so very, very bravely. \u201cThat they won\u2019t let men marry other men.\u201d</p>\n<p>This is subtlety. This is courage. This is the Gryffindor Way, for which medals are made and people get snogged into next Easter.</p>\n<p>Remus cocks his head, bright and surprised and younger, somehow, in the willowy yellow light of their sitting room. \u201cYou know, there are loads of people\u2014not just Death Eaters\u2014who don\u2019t think werewolves should be able to marry,\u201d he says. \u201cLoads of people who aren\u2019t Death Eaters still don\u2019t think much of Muggleborns.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd those people are shit and they need to be told so loudly and often,\u201d says Sirius. \u201cHere\u2014want me to give them rabies? I can maul a few and bring you their bodies, that can be your Christmas present.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have rabies.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll get it. I\u2019ll go out and chew on a bat right now just for you, Moony, say the word and I\u2019ll be foaming at the mouth by the solstice.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMy bloody hero,\u201d laughs Remus, pressing his knee against Sirius\u2019. \u201cFour-letter word for devotion?\u201d</p>\n<p>T-H-I-S, thinks Sirius, all of this, Remus\u2019 shoes by his shoes at the door and his shoulder set against Remus\u2019 shoulder, the sound of their breathing muffled by the sound of the flames in the grate. \u201cLove,\u201d he says, and watches Remus fill it in with that same careful grace he does everything. \u201cHey\u2014that, <em>that\u2019s</em> what we should get for Christmas.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got the Floo and your motorbike and we can both Apparate.\u201d Remus, rubbing his nose, blinks at him in the slim space between them; the firelight gets in his eyes, turns them to gold. \u201cWhy do we need a car?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTravel is only their secondary purpose, you know,\u201d he says, just for the way Remus scrunches up his nose like he can\u2019t decide whether he wants to laugh at him or frown. He smiles.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd what\u2019s their primary purpose, O in Muggle Studies?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSex,\u201d says Sirius, sagely. \u201cYou were probably conceived in one.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh God,\u201d Remus mutters. He\u2019s gone red around the cheeks again, with a distinct undertone of disapprove-y amusement. \u201cI\u2019m not renewing the television license.\u201d</p>\n<p>Once, and not long ago, Sirius would have stuck his tongue in Remus\u2019 ear and said something laced with enough innuendo to drop a convent; now, his cheeks dot with pink and something in the region of his liver squirms at the thought of putting his tongue on Remus, <em>anywhere</em> on Remus, so he settles for scrubbing at the blue stripe on Remus\u2019 jaw where his pen-hand had a few spasms at the mentions of sex. Looking quickly over to Sirius and back, Remus seems to be expecting it, but it never comes, and whatever it is that splashes across Remus\u2019 face\u2014disappointment, hurt, concern\u2014is folded tidily away into his belly and hidden, invisible, with the thousand other aches that claw just beneath his skin.</p>\n<p>It makes him sad and it makes him sore, but mostly it makes Sirius hate himself for putting it there.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll do it myself,\u201d he says, looking straight ahead. \u201cI know exactly how Muggle money works.\u201d</p>\n<p>For as long as he can remember, he and Remus have operated as one cohesive unit, in a different sort of way than he does with James and can\u2019t do with Peter, a lamentable fact Sirius has always blamed on the misfortune of both of them being left-handed. He tugs, and Remus flows; Remus drifts, and Sirius drifts with him, always, always. Remus is the conclusion to his melodrama, his last thought before bed at night, balm to every hurt and every fury that\u2019s ever shivered through his body; it is a fact, like the cold white shift of the winter stars. North-and-South, toast-and-jam, cream-and-coffee. Sirius-and-Remus. Remus-and-Sirius.</p>\n<p>They have breakfast together. They do the shopping together. They mix their laundry, wash dishes together the Muggle way, share drinks, wait up for each other, make tea and soup when one of them is sick or the moon\u2019s hanging iron-heavy in the sky. Sometimes\u2014but not recently\u2014they knot themselves together on the sofa and nap all over each other after long days. Sirius feels like they\u2019re tipping towards something, like maybe they always have been, but he\u2019s got no idea if Remus wants to be there for the collision, or how to tactfully say, with all the certainty of muddled nineteen-year-old blood, <em>I think you are where I\u2019m going, but I need a few directions</em>.</p>\n<p>The whole thing is painfully stupid. He says as much when he\u2019s brushing his teeth while Remus is showering, which is another thing they do that most mates probably just don\u2019t do. \u201cTffith ith hhoofifff,\u201d he tells Remus over the spray of the water. \u201cAadd eeeeerrrd.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t stupid, Padfoot,\u201d says Remus, \u201cand it isn\u2019t weird.\u201d</p>\n<p>That Remus somehow knows what he\u2019s saying while his mouth is full of toothpaste doesn\u2019t register until he\u2019s hurrying out of the bathroom at the same time the knowledge of <em>Remus</em>, three steps away and naked, slams explosively into his forebrain and he has to retreat before he ruptures anything important.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s trying very hard not to think about it and coming up mostly unsuccessful when he looks down the hallway to find Remus leaning against the wall on his way back from the kitchen, just watching him, and Sirius twitches uncertainly off to the side.</p>\n<p>\u201cSirius, I\u2019m\u2014\u201d Remus starts, and closes his mouth, and opens it again. \u201cIs something wrong?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d he says, just as his brain screams, <em>Yes! Everything! Everything is wrong with me</em>. \u201cI\u2019m fine. I\u2019m a peach. Why would anything be wrong?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBecause you\u2019ve been acting bizarre for a while now,\u201d says Remus. He\u2019s clutching at his elbow the way he only does if he\u2019s upset or unexpectedly naked, chewing his lip between his teeth. \u201cIf you\u2019re not complaining about everything being weird you\u2019re acting like you\u2019ve murdered someone every time I talk to you. Or you\u2019re doing this,\u201d he says, gesturing to where Sirius is standing with his hip against the wall, as far away from Remus as he can get. \u201cIs it\u2014did I do something?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo! Why\u2014you\u2019re\u2014why the hell would you think that?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat am I supposed to think, you won\u2019t even look at me half the time! You act like you\u2019re going to, to vibrate out of your own skin or something every time I get too close, and I <em>know</em> I don\u2019t smell and I don\u2019t have any diseases,\u201d he snaps, \u201cbesides the obvious, anyway. Are you going to throw me out? Are you, hell, I don\u2019t know, are you sick of me? I\u2019m sorry I\u2019m boring and weird and un-fun, I just\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cJesus Christ, Remus, what is wrong in your head? I haven\u2019t done anything!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou! You are what is wrong in my head,\u201d Remus half-yells, flapping his arms about like an enormous bird. \u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s happened and you\u2019re acting like a berk and I\u2019m tired of it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTired of what? Being there every time I turn around? Sorry, Remus, you\u2019re fucking stuck with me! Unless you\u2019d like to leave.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIs that what you want?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh my <em>God</em>, Remus no, this is so\u2014I\u2019m bloody tired of you seeing things that aren\u2019t there,\u201d he bites out, miserable, already, deep in the pit of his stomach. \u201cNot everything is a slight against your superior sensibilities, believe it or not.\u201d</p>\n<p>Remus\u2019 face crumples a little, like Sirius has just pulled the plug out of him, but then he\u2019s glaring again, pulled back into the dark space of his bedroom where he pauses long enough to grind out a terse, stuffy-sounding \u201cRight, then,\u201d followed by something very close to \u201carsehole,\u201d and creaks the door on its hinges until it sits open, just a sliver, the way he\u2019s always kept it.</p>\n<p>Sirius, unsure whether he\u2019d rather slam his own door or cry in the hallway or, for the first time, take what he thinks might be Remus\u2019 invitation, paces around his bed for a moment before shutting his door completely and pulling the cool quilt around his shoulders, heartsore and restless in his bones. At Hogwarts, he\u2019d have writhed around theatrically for a bit under the blankets and then gone, penitent, to Remus\u2019 bed, where they\u2019d curl up and talk and share potato crisps and wake up all bedraggled, tangled and together with the morning.</p>\n<p>He wonders if that\u2019s why Remus leaves his door open every night. He wonders if it isn\u2019t.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s easier when you\u2019re young, he thinks, and no one\u2019s going to look at you like you\u2019ve got a few noodles loose for sleeping in your friend\u2019s bed. But then, all of a sudden, the world churns forward on its tracks, and you\u2019re churned with it: School\u2019s over, you\u2019ve turned nineteen\u2014you\u2019re an <em>adult</em>\u2014and you\u2019re supposed to know what to do with these things. You\u2019re supposed to know your own blood. You\u2019re not supposed to stumble around, half-blind, while your brain turns to marshmallow fluff and leaks out your ears.</p>\n<p>Maybe that\u2019s just part of it. Lying in the dark with the cold while your alarm clock tick-tick-ticks and the old fear creeps into your belly, wanting nothing more than to crawl into someone else\u2019s bed for the solidity of their heartbeat to sink down into, and hoping, hoping this is worth all the sleep you\u2019ve lost for it.</p>\n<p>\u2014</p>\n<p>\u201cMcKinnon,\u201d he sputters, clambering out of the fireplace as gracefully as he can with soot in his mouth and what is likely a spider in a very delicate place, \u201cI need to talk to you for a minute.\u201d</p>\n<p>Marlene, still in her shoes with her hair falling from its low chignon, sits up from Dorcas\u2019 lap and frowns\u2014loudly. \u201cI\u2019m going to glue broken glass to the chimney if you don\u2019t start announcing yourself,\u201d she grinds out. \u201cWhat the hell do you want? I\u2019ve only just got home and I thought you were learning to use the front door, anyway.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Remus?\u201d asks Dorcas, peering behind him into the grate.</p>\n<p>Sirius waves his hand and thus both questions away from the important issue at hand: himself. \u201cHe\u2019s not off till six and I didn\u2019t take the tube, so I couldn\u2019t use the door,\u201d he says, and leaves out that the reason he didn\u2019t take the tube is because he\u2019s a little squirmy about doing it on his own and Remus won\u2019t take it with him until he learns to stop laughing every time the tube-voice says \u201cCockfosters,\u201d which is more difficult than he\u2019d anticipated. \u201cI\u2019ve got a question.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo ask it.\u201d</p>\n<p>A deep breath; the air in the flat is all over cinnamon and spice and it makes him itch for Christmas. \u201cHow did you know?\u201d</p>\n<p>Marlene blinks. \u201cHow\u2019d I know what, that you\u2019re an enormous tosspot?\u201d she asks, and then her eyes flash dagger-sharp, blue as cut glass in the last of the gritty London light. \u201cYou mean, how\u2019d I know I\u2019m a dyke.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d he says, mouth dry, \u201cthat.\u201d</p>\n<p>Her lips twist up on one side, just as Dorcas lets out a soft, knowing half-laugh. \u201cFor the record, I always knew this was coming,\u201d says Marlene. \u201cEver since your fifth year, when you\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWE DON\u2019T TALK ABOUT THAT,\u201d he shouts, loud enough to halt the flush in his face.</p>\n<p>\u201cMaybe <em>you</em> don\u2019t,\u201d she leers, and then settles back against the sofa, one arm around Dorcas\u2019 shoulders and her mouth easing into something thoughtful, patient. \u201cIt\u2019s\u2014Merlin, I\u2019m hardly an expert,\u201d she says. \u201cIsn\u2019t this a conversation you really ought to be having with Lupin?\u201d</p>\n<p>He startles. Twice. \u201cWhat the hell\u2019s that supposed to mean?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cChrist, <em>nothing</em>, you titchy little <em>worm</em>, only that\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>It starts in the eyebrows: A slow lifting of the arch that spreads downward to the eyes, brightening and widening at the same time the mouth falls open in a silent exclamation, heralding your imminent doom, or, failing that, your utter and irreversible humiliation, coinciding with the clenching of your entire digestive system. <em>A-ha, Sirius Black</em>, it says, <em>I have found you out</em>!</p>\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d says Dorcas, brown eyes pinning him there, helpless, as he considers climbing up the chimney with his bare hands. Her earrings sway like an accusation when she tilts her head.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d echoes Marlene, far more maliciously. \u201cO-ho! I see what this is about, Black.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo you don\u2019t,\u201d he mutters, searching discreetly for the Floo powder, with no luck.</p>\n<p>\u201cBut I do,\u201d she snorts, merciless. \u201cYou want to nail Remus Lupin like a loose floorboard.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sirius says something, something he means to be <em>I most certainly do not</em>! or <em>Who the hell is Remus Lupin?</em> or, mostly, <em>How dare you insinuate that I would be so rough with him</em>, but what comes out is, \u201cEerrrrrggmph.\u201d</p>\n<p>All things considered, it\u2019s a strangely accurate summation of his current thoughts.</p>\n<p>\u201cLook,\u201d says Dorcas, watching him with sympathy and amusement quirked on her lips, \u201cit\u2019s probably best if you get that much out, and if you can\u2019t tell him, tell us. You\u2019ll feel better.\u201d</p>\n<p>Well.</p>\n<p>He takes a breath, stares at the garland of stars hung above the sofa, and says, \u201cI want to nail Remus like a loose floorboard and I spend half the night wanting to bury my face in his stupid hair so much it makes me want to dive off the fucking roof and I have for a long time now.\u201d An exhale, an inhale. \u201cBut it\u2019s not like it\u2019s <em>only</em> him, I mean, it\u2019s\u2014he\u2019s not the only one I\u2019ve\u2014I don\u2019t fucking know anything,\u201d he finishes, dragging his hand uselessly through his hair.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou know you\u2019re bent and that\u2019s at least a start,\u201d says Dorcas, nodding. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to know everything immediately. I didn\u2019t. <em>She</em> didn\u2019t.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd I still didn\u2019t know, even after a few trips behind the broomshed.\u201d Marlene grins, and Dorcas pulls her closer by the hand draped across her back until Marlene kisses her, leaving a violently pink lipstick-stain on her mouth. \u201cBut we both figured it out. And knocked our heads together along the way.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe did a lot of knocking,\u201d Dorcas agrees, stealing a drink of Marlene\u2019s tea, squeezing her knee. This, Sirius thinks, is what he wants\u2014this tight intimacy, this funny patchwork thing with another person. It occurs to him that he might have it already, minus the kissing, and the thought makes something warm and jangly bubble up inside him, pulsing all the way to his toes. \u201cSirius\u2014you\u2019re just fine,\u201d Dorcas tells him. \u201cThe important thing is that you ask yourself questions, and you\u2019re happy with your own answers.\u201d</p>\n<p>Marlene stands, dusting off her skirt and steering him back towards the fireplace with a hand on his shoulder; strangely gentle, for the thunderous bundle of lungs and legs that is Marlene McKinnon. \u201cBlack, if I know you, and God knows I do, you\u2019re here because you\u2019ve made a colossal arse of yourself and trod upon Lupin\u2019s dainty heart,\u201d she says, wrinkling her nose, \u201cor else he\u2019s doing that thing where he\u2019s being a bit of a stuffy tit again. Either way, I think you really need to be honest with him instead of shutting him out, which is no doubt why you are here tracking soot on our carpeting at this very moment.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd then what? \u2018By the way Remus, I\u2019d really love to be naked with you, like, right now?\u2019\u2019\u201d It\u2019s just not on to say things like that to your friends. Bad enough to think them, bad enough to want them, guiltily, miserably; actually saying it results in nothing less than cataclysm and heartbreak 99.99% of the time. They\u2019ve done studies. Sirius just can\u2019t bother to cite them.</p>\n<p>\u201cUnless I\u2019m mistaken, that\u2019d knock him flat on his back,\u201d says Dorcas. \u201cAnd I\u2019m not.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sirius chokes a little; Marlene squeezes him by the cheeks with one hand and turns his head back to her, grabbing a handful of powder from a chipped vase on the mantel with the other, her lips cutting a smile so soft across her face it would look unnatural were it not for the knifepoint of an incisor peering over her bottom lip. \u201cGo talk to him. You\u2019ll be surprised how much better it makes you feel.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIf you\u2019re wrong, I\u2019m coming back and I want you to flush me down the toilet.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll make sure it\u2019s clean for you,\u201d she says. \u201cNow\u2014out. Grovel. Cry. Get shagged. Bring him round for dinner. In the meantime, we\u2019ll be here if you need anything.\u201d</p>\n<p>He supposes, stepping into the flames, it\u2019s a little easier to move once you\u2019ve uncorked yourself a bit and let some of your stuffing out; supposes, until he hears \u201cUse protection!\u201d bellowed after him just as the soot gets in his eyes, and\u2014oh, there goes his stomach again, dropping down to his ankles somewhere around Rainham.</p>\n<p>\u2014</p>\n<p>Long after dinner, long after he\u2019s washed the soot from his hair and expertly avoided Remus\u2019 eyes for the better part of the evening, Sirius sits down at the kitchen table just before midnight and throws himself a one-man pity-party with a jar of peanut butter and a box of gingerbread men, taking care not to use the same spoon twice lest Remus find out\u2014and he always finds out. The whole thing, he thinks, would be a lot easier if he were more like Marlene and he could just say it the way she would: <em>Remus, I\u2019m bent backwards and I fancy you so much it\u2019s a little disgusting. There it is. Bat\u2019s in your hand now; do what you will with it</em>.</p>\n<p>A lot of things would be easier if he were more like Marlene, an ideal he\u2019s aspired to occasionally with few actual results, possibly due to the lack of solid steel ovaries.</p>\n<p>\u201cI really hope you haven\u2019t used that spoon more than once.\u201d</p>\n<p>Remus, sleepy-sweet and soft at the mouth in his flannel pyjamas and his fuzziest socks, smiles at him and pulls a mug from the cupboard, heating the water with the very tips of his fingers. \u201cI\u2019m using every bit of self-restraint in my body,\u201d says Sirius. \u201cAnd it\u2019s fucking miraculous because bodies don\u2019t have self-restraint, it\u2019s a myth sold to the meek and cautious by our capitalist overlords to keep us from doing what we really want to do.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd I\u2019m very proud of you, raging against the dying of the light as you are,\u201d says Remus, stirring his cocoa as he sits. \u201cMust be a bad one.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBecause you only eat them head-first when you\u2019re really upset,\u201d he says, raising his eyebrows over his mug.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d says Sirius, decapitating one more. \u201cI am. I don\u2019t mean to\u2014look, I\u2019m pond scum, I\u2019m crust around the milk carton. It\u2019s not you, Remus.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPadfoot\u2014please. You can tell me,\u201d says Remus, both hands clutching his cocoa, eyes brighter than Sirius can ever remember seeing them. He thinks, wildly, that there\u2019s probably nothing he could do that would ever make Remus hate him; he can snap the spines on all the books in the house, eat too much Christmas pudding and be sick on the floor, accidentally let the ex-aristocrat boil over once in a while, and Remus will still like him anyway. He could kill a man and Remus would probably offer to figure out the exact depth and length of the hole they\u2019d need to hide the body and show him how to get the stains out of his clothes.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s nothing, truly nothing, that will disrupt this orbit, this cyclical rhythm they\u2019ve stepped into together, right in time with their hearts.</p>\n<p>\u201cMoony, am I a prick?\u201d he asks.</p>\n<p>Remus blinks and sets his mug down, then picks it up again to hide his smirk at the bottom. \u201cBy what definition?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYours.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d he says, and when he lowers his hands, Sirius can see the smile blooming on his lips, warm and easy and just for him. \u201cHonestly, if that\u2019s what you\u2019ve been all twitchy and red in the face about, you could\u2019ve just said you were growing a new feeling. I can still call you an immature tosser if you want and we\u2019ll\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m bent,\u201d says Sirius.</p>\n<p>Sometimes, Remus\u2019 face does this funny floppy thing where it can\u2019t decide whether it wants to be shocked or thrilled or mystified, and so it settles for fast-forwarding through twenty different emotions until falling, shell-shocked, back into place. Sirius loves it.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou know, you\u2014you really could have talked to me about that instead of acting like a, a complete\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cA prick?\u201d he offers though the gingerbread carnage.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo! Just\u2014\u201d Remus waves a hand about and takes a fortifying sip of cocoa. \u201cI wish you\u2019d said something,\u201d he says. \u201cI mean. I do have <em>some</em> idea what it\u2019s like.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd when have you ever done anything about it? Hmm?\u201d Sirius shoves one last cookie into his mouth and steals some of Remus\u2019 cocoa. It always tastes better out of his mug. \u201cBesides, I don\u2019t\u2014Christ, this is stupid, I don\u2019t even know what I <em>am</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNeither does anyone else, at first,\u201d says Remus, reaching for his mug. \u201cYou know, I wondered. After fifth year, when you\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSTOP\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhen you snogged Frank Longbottom after Alice broke it off with him, because, oh yes, \u2018It seemed like the gentlemanly thing to do,\u2019\u201d Remus finishes, utterly relentless, something wicked howling in his eyes. \u201cYou\u2019re not\u2014I mean, you\u2019re not having some crisis, are you? Is that what Purebloods do?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNot like that.\u201d Sirius, still glaring, flicks a few crumbs at Remus and pinches the bridge of his nose. \u201cI took Muggle Studies, I know all about their sexual insecurity and they\u2019re a sad, sad lot with so much to answer for, Moony, I mean, crew cuts and khaki trousers and weekend golf, whatever that is. It\u2019s just\u2014I don\u2019t, God, I don\u2019t know, y\u2019know, if I\u2019m\u2014I\u2019ve never even,\u201d he makes a vague, fluttery gesture with his hands that Remus apparently understands, cocking his head in a way that makes Sirius want to kiss his big stupid nose.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know whether you like boys more or girls. Or both, equally.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat. That, exactly,\u201d he says, running a hand through his hair as his brain finishes with, <em>I also spend most of the day wanting to put my mouth on your mouth, can you explain that one, too</em>. \u201cHow did you know? Because let\u2019s not pretend you\u2019re out there having it off with anyone, ever, at all.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s really not all it\u2019s about,\u201d says Remus, choking a little and turning a really nice shade of strawberry. \u201cI mean, <em>yes</em>, that\u2019s important, but that\u2019s not all there is, not at all. And you don\u2019t have to\u2014to go out and shag anyone to know.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo\u2014?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo,\u201d he continues, looking away, \u201cI know I like both, but I like boys more. I didn\u2019t know that immediately, Sirius. And there are times when I still wonder.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMaybe I\u2019m gay.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you attracted to women, Sirius?\u201d</p>\n<p>This has got to be the most unbelievable conversation he\u2019s ever had in his life, and yet, here he is, Remus Lupin looking at him, asking, in all earnestness, how much he likes to snog women. He thinks about Mary Macdonald, thinks about her laugh, the way she moved in his hands and his mouth; how happy it made him, to see her smile, to know he plucked it out of her. \u201cYeah. I am.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThen I don\u2019t think you\u2019re gay.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBisexual,\u201d he says, feeling the word out under his tongue. It\u2019s like a new robe: fresh and crisp and a little starchy in its long vowels, maybe a little too big. He\u2019s not sure it fits. \u201cI don\u2019t know. It\u2019s been\u2014what, at least three years now, shouldn\u2019t I know?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to have an answer right now,\u201d says Remus, wiping at Sirius\u2019 chin where he\u2019s left crumbs. \u201cAnd if you\u2019re never comfortable giving it a name, that\u2019s your business. I just don\u2019t want you to think there\u2019s something <em>wrong</em> with being confused or not knowing right away, because\u2014I mean, maybe some people do know when they\u2019re really young, or really quickly, but I just don\u2019t think that\u2019s how it works for most of us.\u201d</p>\n<p>At the corner of his mouth, sloping all the way down towards his chin, he can still feel Remus\u2019 fingers, warm and quill-calloused like ghosts his skin wants to remember. \u201cIs that how it was with you?\u201d</p>\n<p>Remus nods. \u201cI never had some sort of, I don\u2019t know, epiphany, or whatever. It was a while before I set myself straight\u2014don\u2019t laugh, that\u2019s a bad joke\u2014and it was a while after that before I knew I had a definite preference. It\u2019s like\u2014you know it\u2019s a part of you, it\u2019s <em>there</em> just sort of twinging in you all the time, but you\u2019re never going to know what it is or how to let it spark if you don\u2019t take it out and look at it and learn yourself.\u201d</p>\n<p>He watches Remus, his long fingers twined through the handle of his mug, his profile in sharp relief against the coolness of the kitchen shadows and a few frizzy hairs sticking out from the rest, sharpened to gold in the hush of the night. He\u2019s lovely, Sirius thinks, his great honking nose, his mouth pressed into the shape of fond amusement, every scar split into his skin and every daft thing he\u2019s ever said; all of him, all of him.</p>\n<p>\u201cFor what it\u2019s worth, I\u2019m shocked you haven\u2019t shagged your way through the library,\u201d says Sirius, watching him flush, grinning. \u201cWhat research are you really working on for Dumbledore, eh? Eh? You\u2019re probably the subject of so many fantasies I don\u2019t know how those ears haven\u2019t burned right off your head.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGod, no,\u201d he sputters, pushing his chair in. \u201cI\u2019m not. I wouldn\u2019t even know what to do.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPeople <em>like</em> you, Moony. The librarians probably want to take you home and stuff you\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh my God\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFull of cheesecake, what the hell did you think I was going to say?\u201d he asks, swallowing one last cookie and tipping his chair back on its hind legs. \u201cLeast we know where your mind is. Dirty, dirty werewolf.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI hate you,\u201d says Remus, entirely without rancor, \u201cand anyway, I\u2019ve read things. So.\u201d He shrugs, rinses his cup out, and then turns to Sirius, teetering with expert danger in his chair, and says, \u201cCome to bed, Pads.\u201d</p>\n<p>Something in Sirius\u2019 head snaps; he can actually hear it. \u201cUh?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBed,\u201d says Remus, painting on his most exasperated face. \u201cYou\u2019ve got work tomorrow and you know I can\u2019t get anything done if I\u2019m worried about you functioning on no sleep.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou do get all flappy and consumptive,\u201d says Sirius, standing and feeling loose in his bones, like a knot unraveled, like he could see by the light of his own skin. \u201cMoony\u2014thanks.\u201d</p>\n<p>Remus smiles, moon-bright, and turns out the kitchen light.</p>\n<p>At his door, exactly opposite Remus\u2019 door, he hesitates, cold suddenly and <em>wanting</em>, wanting so many things he doesn\u2019t know how to ask for when Remus turns to him and sighs. \u201cWould you quit being a plonker and get in here.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sirius does, and Remus, for the first time since they moved into their drafty house and stuffed it to the seams with themselves, shuts the door.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s not had much cause to be in Remus\u2019 room before, but now that he is, Sirius finds himself looking around at the tottering piles of books that won\u2019t fit on the shelves and the camera and the rumpled parchment on the desk, the Muggle sticky notes he\u2019s been hiding from Sirius, and decides he likes it better in here: the chaotic clamor of wet ink and socks sticking out of drawers, the scarves wrapped over the chair, the loamy-warm smell of the cloves he keeps in an empty wine bottle on his dresser. Between the curtains, he can see the snow falling in the honeyed flicker of Hogsmeade\u2019s streetlights, washing everything out; the neighbors have already decorated the enormous spruce in their front yard, all gold and green. He would stay here, he thinks. He would stay here.</p>\n<p>\u201cLet\u2019s get a tree this weekend,\u201d he says. \u201cWe can make macaroni Christmas art for the front door and teach these heathens the real meaning of Christmas: ugly ornaments and gorging yourself on store-bought biscuits.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll spike the eggnog,\u201d says Remus, pulling the quilt back and reaching over to set the alarm. He doesn\u2019t take his socks off. \u201cCome to bed.\u201d</p>\n<p>It\u2019s smaller than a Hogwarts four-poster, cotton-warm and fleecy, and Sirius is certain to his core that nothing in the world has ever been better. The sheets are thick, pilled-up blue flannel, smelling of laundry soap and bright, familiar things, Moony-things, all earthy and sun-soft. Across from him, Remus turns on his side and smiles, tugging the quilt closer around them. In all his life, in all his longing, Sirius has never wanted to kiss anyone more.</p>\n<p>\u201cGoodnight,\u201d says Remus. He still puts one arm under his pillow, just like he used to. \u201cI\u2019ll make lunch if you want to come home for break tomorrow. I\u2019m off.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re such a housewife,\u201d he says. Beneath the quilt and the fluffy blanket Remus has put under it, Sirius\u2019 knees touch Remus\u2019 knees. \u201cYou know, this is w\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>Remus\u2019 hand clamps over his mouth before he can get it out, cold fingers pressing into his cheek. Sirius shuts up. \u201cThis isn\u2019t weird. If you think it\u2019s weird, it\u2019s probably because your mother said so once when you were seven and now it\u2019s coming out to keep me awake twelve years later,\u201d he says. \u201cYou\u2019re all right, Sirius. All of you.\u201d</p>\n<p>He nods, pulls Remus\u2019 hand down by the wrist, and, after a small sliver of hesitation, wraps it in his own, playing with his fingers. \u201cI know what you want,\u201d he says, smirking crookedly. \u201cYou want me to be your personal space heater. It\u2019s a good thing for you I come cheap, apple stuffing.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh no,\u201d Remus drawls lazily, \u201che\u2019s seen through my ruse! How long before he realizes I only keep him around for decoration and sometimes dinner.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBastard,\u201d he says. \u201cBut it <em>is</em> a little weird\u2014no, don\u2019t give me that look. It is. What the hell are you going to do when I\u2019m seventy years old and climbing into your bed, I\u2019d like to know.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLet you in,\u201d says Remus, eyes wide and no hesitation at all, as if it\u2019s a fact like iron in the blood, like the grace of their fingers, intertwined. As if it\u2019s the only answer there\u2019s ever been.</p>\n<p>Late, late in the blue lull of the night, as the minutes dissolve and Sirius drifts with them, he watches Remus in the dark, the rhythmic rise-and-fall of his chest, his eyelashes making long shadows on his cheeks, and he thinks this is all he wants: the two of them cloistered together on this bed, all the spaces they\u2019ve filled between them. Remus\u2019 hand is still, held under his and warmed by his skin when he bends his head and kisses his knuckles, so soft it might have been a dream but for the quickening of Remus\u2019 heart against his fingers, the one part of him he could never train to quiet, measured obedience.</p>\n<p>Touch is truth, language without tongues, confession without speech. There are words for the thrill of Sirius\u2019 heartbeat thrumming in answer to Remus\u2019, all of them dark, lavish, beautiful things clamoring for his mouth to give them shape and form, but for now, he lets his fingers say it, lets his blood speak them here where nothing else can, in the solid honesty of their bodies.</p>\n<p>\u2014</p>\n<p>Dragging himself out of Remus\u2019 bed to be sucked into the cold vortex of the morning, and therefore work, is the greatest misery he\u2019s ever known in his young and occasionally explosive life; it\u2019s so cold, in fact, that it\u2019s probably going to <em>kill</em> him, which prompts Remus to lay an indulgent hand on his forehead and inform him that, no, he\u2019s not actually dying and he should probably get to work if he doesn\u2019t want to hear Moody twitch about the time it takes to hex some very important bits into oblivion while you\u2019re whining about your frozen toes. He\u2019s heard it at least six times before, concluding, always, with \u201cIf you\u2019re not early, you\u2019re late,\u201d which Sirius just can\u2019t reconcile with his whole outlook on life.</p>\n<p>By the time he Apparates into Hogsmeade for lunch, he\u2019s four times as miserable as he was when he left. His boots are soaked through, they\u2019ve failed to make an arrest, James ate the last two muffins, Moody twitched at him anyway, and he can\u2019t think a single bloody thing that doesn\u2019t run right back to Remus Lupin like some endless one-track loop. Not that he minds that last one so much; Remus is what usually gets him through the nine o\u2019clock tragedies, and, failing that, his bony ankles sticking out from underneath his pyjama bottoms every night will do it.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m dying,\u201d he calls from the entryway, fighting his way out of his coat and scarf and soggy boots. \u201cMonday has squeezed me like a Christmas orange, I told you I\u2014oh, you made cheese toasties.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI put tomatoes in yours,\u201d says Remus. He\u2019s wearing the obnoxious seasonal socks Sirius bought him last year; they make him look very festive. \u201cHow is it out there? Have any of your organs shut down yet?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNot yet but they\u2019re trying, Moony, my liver will explode by the end of the day. Take good care of the motorbike for me,\u201d he says, falling into the chair and shoving as much sandwich as he can fit into his mouth all at once. \u201cWhy are you drinking cider? Cider doesn\u2019t go with cheese toasties. That\u2019s just vulgar.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCider goes with everything,\u201d says Remus, \u201cI\u2019ll drink it while I\u2019m changing the oil in your motorbike, or whatever. It\u2019ll bring back painful memories, but I\u2019ll remember your last moments with fondness, tomato skin hanging out of your mouth and all. No, really\u2014close it. Close your damn mouth.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThink of me when you\u2019re greasing those big thick cables,\u201d he grins. \u201cJust keep James away from my funeral, he\u2019ll eat all the canap\u00e9s and I know how you like them.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo selfless, even on your deathbed.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m only thinking of your stomach,\u201d he says, and Remus smiles at him.</p>\n<p>They eat quietly for a few minutes, Sirius thinking that his imminent undeath might provide a good excuse to tell Remus a few other things, when Remus catches him staring, mid-chew, and he has to plead with his face not to turn an unattractive puce; focusing on the grey sludge outside helps a little. He can feel Remus watching him, imagines him wondering, uncertainly, what he\u2019s thinking.</p>\n<p>Sometimes, usually in the crush of pale, brittle moments like these, Sirius thinks that maybe he knows, that maybe he\u2019s always known. Remus Lupin is the least oblivious person he\u2019s ever known in his life, fluent in the shift of shadows and the yearning of empty hands, reading always the things people grow in their margins like spilled ink; Sirius knows Remus can see his stained fingers, dripping a loud, incriminating red. But Remus is also an accomplished liar, and never more than where it concerns himself: If Sirius acted like this around anyone else, Remus would know exactly what to call it; when Sirius acts like this around <em>him</em>, Remus probably thinks he\u2019s accidentally gotten treacle in bad places again.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s never been able to lie to his friends, though. He gets all shifty in the eyes and sad in the shoulders.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo,\u201d Remus says finally, \u201chow\u2019s being bent?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right. It\u2019s\u2014still a little confusing,\u201d he says. \u201cMy head feels better, though.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s only temporary, you know.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIs it?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell\u2014that\u2019s what my mum used to say. About the change,\u201d says Remus, cocking his head. It\u2019s terribly sweet. \u201cIt\u2019s really not, but it works better if you apply it to how confused you are over which bits you like better.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYour mum is a beautiful woman,\u201d he says, finishing off his pumpkin juice. \u201cWhen are you going home this year? I\u2019ll buy her something nice and spicy. You, too, if you\u2019re a good boy.\u201d</p>\n<p>Remus pulls his jumper down over his hands, running his thumb over the chip in his mug. \u201cActually, I talked to her this morning,\u201d he says. \u201cI mean, she\u2019ll just be going to her sister\u2019s anyway, and you know how I can\u2019t deal with the cats, or the cabbage, so\u2014I\u2019m going to stay here this year,\u201d he finishes, looking up with summer in his eyes, warmer than a bit of August at the first of December.</p>\n<p>Something bright shocks through Sirius, starting in his belly and spreading like a stain down to his toes, reaches into his throat and steals the breath right out of his lungs. \u201cMoony! I\u2019m getting <em>you</em> for Christmas. We\u2019ve never had Christmas together. Not even once.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI know,\u201d says Remus, smiling brightly. \u201cD\u2019you suppose we should send joint Christmas cards?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe should send joint <em>proclamations</em>.\u201d Sirius takes their plates to the sink and waves them through the motions of a wandless wash. \u201cThis is momentous.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s an Occasion,\u201d Remus agrees. Sirius hears the capital letter. \u201cHere, give me those\u2014we can eat a whole pie and no one\u2019s going to care.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou act like I haven\u2019t been doing that for the last three years.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut now you\u2019ll have to <em>share</em>,\u201d says Remus. \u201cWe can be sick on pie together, it\u2019ll be like a trust exercise where we take turns with the toilet.\u201d</p>\n<p>By his own estimation, Sirius has eaten half his weight in Christmas pies since he left home, between Hogwarts and James\u2019 mum and the Hogsmeade bakery; on his own, always, because for as much as he loves the Potters, he\u2019s never felt right stomping around the place at Christmas the way he used to do over the summer, regardless of James\u2019 protests. He doesn\u2019t remember ever having a proper Christmas dinner with someone who wasn\u2019t a professor or a family member sneering at him for using the wrong fork and refusing to let him put whipped cream on things while they droned about the Ministry and which wing of the house needed renovating this year.</p>\n<p>And here Remus is, offering to get sick on pie with him. He feels like he might burst.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m going to roast you a whole turkey,\u201d he decides. \u201cThat\u2019s fucking <em>difficult</em>, but that\u2019s just how devoted I am to what\u2019s really important in life.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOur gluttony.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cExactly,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ll make you shepherd\u2019s pie with leftovers.\u201d</p>\n<p>Remus makes a noise, something halfway between a moan and a squeak that really shouldn\u2019t be attractive coming from anyone, but here Sirius is, mouth dry, heart lurching in his chest. \u201cGod, that\u2019s the best thing you\u2019ve ever said to me,\u201d he murmurs. And then, \u201cWho knows, maybe you\u2019ll find a boy to snog at New Year\u2019s.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sirius swallows and goes quiet at once, still as an effigy. \u201cI\u2014why would you say that?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, why not? I thought you wanted to.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, but\u2014it\u2019s just,\u201d he waves his hand, indicative of approximately nothing. \u201cI\u2019ve never. You know. What if I\u2019m <em>bad</em> at it?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut Frank\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cRemus, I will kill you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay, fine. <em>Prongs</em>,\u201d he says, lifting both accusing eyebrows. \u201cI know you\u2019ve kissed James, I\u2019ve seen you do it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s different!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHow? Because he had his trousers on and Frank didn\u2019t?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, you absolute prick, it\u2019s just\u2014it\u2019s <em>different</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHave you got any idea how much sense that doesn\u2019t make?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, because it makes perfect sense,\u201d he says, very slowly, waiting for his words to sink into Remus\u2019 ears. \u201cIt was never like that\u2014all right, maybe once or twice\u2014but it was mostly, y\u2019know, just because. For practice.\u201d</p>\n<p>This, he realizes as Remus chokes, sputters, and starts laughing so hard he grabs the kitchen counter, is an enormous mistake he is never going to be allowed to forget. Years from now, if he really is climbing into Remus\u2019 bed at seventy on his sleepless midnights, he\u2019ll startle sometimes, half-asleep, to hear Remus gasping breathlessly just the same as he is right now, \u201cPractice! Oh my God, for <em>practice</em>!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFuck you, Lupin. I\u2019ll have you know I\u2019ve never had a single complaint.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, Padfoot, James wouldn\u2019t know any better,\u201d says Remus, all vengeful glee, laughing even harder when Sirius knocks his shoulder into his and sends him stumbling sideways.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou know what I mean, you <em>beast</em>.\u201d He glares halfheartedly at Remus, who is still having small, extremely convulsive fits at the sink. \u201cI\u2019ve never kissed another man, you know, seriously. I\u2019ve never meant it. Just James. Fine\u2014and Frank.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d says Remus, quieting, finding his eyes and holding them until Sirius looks away.</p>\n<p>\u201cI know,\u201d he says, \u201cI\u2019m just\u2014I\u2019m not sure how to go about the whole, the logistics, and I\u2019m a little\u2014nervous. It\u2019s weird. Um.\u201d He scrubs a hand through his hair, feeling too big and too heavy for his own skin, out of tune, like he\u2019s moving through something orchestrated that just looks awkward and painful. \u201cI do <em>want</em> to.\u201d</p>\n<p>Something about the shapes they make by the sink, he thinks. Something about the way their voices thread together in this house, because Remus is very close, his hand fumbling for Sirius\u2019 hand; when he leans over and kisses him, Sirius can smell him, thick-knit jumper and Ivory soap, apple cider on his lips. He opens his eyes.</p>\n<p>\u201cFirst one out of the way, then,\u201d Remus whispers, turning his head towards the window. Sirius can see the pulse beating in the thin skin of his neck.</p>\n<p>He opens his mouth and closes it, groping blindly for a single word and finding none. Eventually, his brain slotting back into place slightly, the world slamming into focus, he says, \u201cYou kissed me.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI did.\u201d Remus is looking wildly around the room, maybe hoping if he looks anywhere but Sirius all the awkward static crackling between them will evaporate and they\u2019ll just step back into twelve seconds ago. \u201cSo. Now you know. What it\u2019s like, I mean, in the event that\u2014that you need to,\u201d he mutters. \u201cI don\u2019t know what I\u2019m saying, I\u2019m, Christ, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPlease do that again,\u201d he says.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2014what?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPlease kiss me,\u201d says Sirius, trying very hard to hold all his pieces together at once.</p>\n<p>Remus kisses him with the softness of uncertain things, his lips slightly chapped when they move against Sirius\u2019, apple-sweet, honey-slow; their noses brush together when he tilts his head, Remus\u2019 slight stubble scratching at his chin. It\u2019s ticklish. It\u2019s warm. It\u2019s absolutely bloody amazing.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s also different from kissing a girl, in a way he definitely likes.</p>\n<p>When Remus pulls away this time, Sirius catches him by the hips, his eyes on Remus\u2019 eyes, his breathing conflating with Remus\u2019 breathing, and the moment stretches out between them: silent and heavy here with all the things they\u2019re not saying, pulled around them tightrope-taut until Sirius snaps it, wrenching them off their unfailing axis and into the bread cupboard, kissing Remus so hard the oak doors rattle and their teeth clack together. He pulls back a second time, a third, only for Remus to reach up and twine his fingers through his hair and slide their mouths together again, shivering and pressing up against Sirius when he flicks his tongue between his lips, heedless of the clock chiming on the mantel, heedless of any time but their own.</p>\n<p>\u201cIs this what you did with James,\u201d he gasps, taking Sirius\u2019 head between his palms, which are hot and slightly damp.</p>\n<p>\u201cNot even a little,\u201d he answers. Remus\u2019 throat bobs when he swallows, and his eyes, God, his eyes are brighter than Sirius can ever remember seeing them, shot through with gold and so beautifully, breathtakingly <em>young</em>.</p>\n<p>\u201cGood,\u201d says Remus, and tugs him down again.</p>\n<p>Deep in the rational part of his brain, in the single neuron that\u2019s still functioning, he thinks he likes this <em>better</em> than kissing girls; it\u2019s harder and softer at the same time, and easier, somehow, to know how to be both at once with another boy\u2019s narrow hips and chest smashed into his own. Remus makes a small, pleased sound in the back of his throat and pulls away, running his hands wildly up Sirius\u2019 biceps to his shoulders, making him lean even closer, not a fragment of space between them.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to be late,\u201d says Remus, even as he kisses along Sirius\u2019 jaw, behind his ear.</p>\n<p>\u201cI know,\u201d he whispers. He\u2019s hard and fairly sure Remus is too and they\u2019re both honor-bound to pretend they\u2019re not; the cold air will just have to resolve things for him, for now. \u201cI\u2019m confused, Moony.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you, now,\u201d Remus murmurs, <em>oh</em>, right against his lips.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m a mess.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell.\u201d Remus squeezes his shoulders and looks up slowly, his lips red against his flushed skin; Sirius runs his teeth along the silvery scar on his chin, older than all their time together. \u201cMaybe I can un-confuse you, you know. When you get home.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh God,\u201d he groans, right over Remus\u2019 pulse, \u201cI\u2019m\u2014I\u2019ve got to get through a <em>whole goddamn afternoon</em>, do you have any idea\u2014you\u2019ve\u2014I can\u2019t even talk,\u201d he stammers, weak in the knees. \u201cJesus Christ, Moony, <em>warn</em> me next time!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWarn you!\u201d he laughs, a tiny bubble of hysteria breaking out of his throat and making the blood surge up in Sirius\u2019 ears like a brilliant blue cloudburst. \u201cI\u2019ve done nothing but warn you for\u2014for three <em>years</em> now, you great berk, I can\u2019t believe\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI have to go,\u201d he murmurs, kissing Remus again, again, again, and then <em>again</em>, dragging himself away from him like one enormous human bandage and letting his hands fall down Remus\u2019 waist to his hips until he finally peels away for the last time, everything in him straining still for Remus\u2014his hands, his August eyes. \u201cI have to go and we\u2019re going to\u2014we\u2019re going to do a lot of things when I get home,\u201d he finishes, eloquently.</p>\n<p>\u201cThings,\u201d says Remus, nodding as Sirius forces his feet to the door. \u201cYes. Things.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo don\u2019t you fucking dare leave this house,\u201d he growls, one hand on the door. Remus still hasn\u2019t moved from the bread cupboard; he watches Sirius, unblinking, as he half-trips over his untied bootlaces and steps outside.</p>\n<p>He stumbles across the front yard in a daze, pressing his fingers to his lips as he hurries down the slippery cobbles of the street and the shrill yellow winterlight tears open the December sky, everything so fierce and rich and alive; he feels as if something inside him has galvanized, solidified\u2014his blood, the marrow in his bones, like he\u2019s holding all his disjointed parts together for the first time. When Sirius Apparates, he thinks of Remus, his hands clutching his shoulders, his heart under Sirius\u2019 mouth as they stumbled, together, into a new shape. How easy it was, to hold onto him. How hard it was, to let go.</p>\n<p>\u2014</p>\n<p>Back down at headquarters, waiting for Dumbledore to show up and say something Ageless and Mysterious, Sirius bounces his leg up and down and chews his nails to ragged, frazzled stumps, checking the clock automatically every twenty seconds and glaring acidly when it refuses to quicken its sluggish pulse. He\u2019s going through his mental list of things he\u2019d like to do with Remus for the fourth time and trying to figure out 1.) how to articulate them, and 2.) how to even go about half of them, when James Potter, half-human, half-Niffler, slides in beside him, sniffing his neck and cheek with unnatural and vaguely frightening interest.</p>\n<p>\u201cYum,\u201d says James. \u201cHave you been eating apples?\u201d</p>\n<p>For some reason, probably the same reason Emmeline Vance\u2019s cheese toasty makes him go wobbly in the legs, nothing has ever been more hilarious than this. After he recovers somewhat, still shaking with a few repressed laughs, he clears his throat and meets James\u2019 judging eyes, drilling brown bullet holes into him, and promptly dissolves into another fit that leaves his stomach wonderfully, impossibly fluttery.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve been eating <em>something</em>,\u201d he mutters, low and wild.</p>\n<p>\u201cMate, if I didn\u2019t know any better right now I\u2019d swear you were high,\u201d says James, sniffing his shirt again. \u201cWhere the hell did you go for lunch?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHome,\u201d he grins.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd what did you do, drink one of Moony\u2019s potions?\u201d James\u2019 eyes narrow, traveling down Sirius\u2019 well-bred nose to his lips, which are still rather red and a little puffy, and then down farther to his rumpled collar where a tiny bruise is blooming on the sensitive skin there; at that, they fly immediately fly back up to meet Sirius\u2019, looking amazed and mildly scandalized. \u201cOh my God,\u201d he says wonderingly, \u201coh my <em>God</em>, you deflowered Moony over your lunch break, I figured you\u2019d wait till at least Christmas, you slag! How is he? How\u2019s\u2014oh my God, what was that <em>like</em>?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t you like to know, you little\u2014would you <em>stop</em> sniffing me, I don\u2019t have any food on me today, thanks for that! Honestly, you\u2019d think <em>you</em> were the pregnant one,\u201d he grumbles, leaning away. \u201cAnyway, we didn\u2019t\u2014you know. That.\u201d He runs a hand through his hair, checks the clock again; five minutes have counted themselves out while James sniffed his face. \u201cAnd where\u2019s this concern for <em>me</em>, I\u2019d like to know? You never ask after me or Pete, you inconsiderate knob.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve seen you almost every bloody day of my life since we were eleven and I still haven\u2019t forgiven Wormtail for being sick in my hair,\u201d says James, still watching him with something like happiness lighting up the shadows on his face. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen Moony in more than a week and you know I pine if he\u2019s away from me for too long.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cRemus is just fine, and I would know. Don\u2019t you worry about it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t trust you. You\u2019ve scrambled his poor brilliant mind, haven\u2019t you? <em>Haven\u2019t</em> you? I hope you at least made him some tea after your little afternoon hit-and-run.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBegging for details will get you absolutely nowhere,\u201d says Sirius, throwing one more venomous glance at the clock. \u201cYou\u2019re a sad, sad man, Potter, you\u2019ll just have to get your vicarious little thrills elsewhere because I am not feeding you. Some of us,\u201d he says, drawing himself up to full ramrod-backed, lazy-mouthed aristocratic splendor, \u201chave a sense of <em>honor</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll remember that the next time Padfoot rolls on something dead,\u201d James mutters, turning towards him again and smiling his widest smile, crooked, exultant. \u201cI\u2019m just\u2014I\u2019m really happy you\u2019re getting there, you know,\u201d he says. \u201cI love you, mate.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLove you too. God knows why.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s because of my perfect, ripe, chiseled\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFlaccid\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFuck you.\u201d James grins at him. \u201cAnd you better treat him like a damn princess or I\u2019ll hurt you badly,\u201d James says cheerfully, stretching an arm across Sirius\u2019 shoulders. \u201cYou can tell him I said the same goes for him, too.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cJealousy makes you look bloated and hideous, Prongs,\u201d he says, happier, by far, than he\u2019s been for months, immune even to the ticking of the clock on the wall and the thousand different darknesses seeping into the creases of their floor-length maps with James\u2019 arm around him. The impatient hurry-up hurry-up hurry-up of his heart knocking against his chest, the way he misses Remus like fire\u2014even that is bearable, if only just.</p>\n<p>\u2014</p>\n<p>Five o\u2019clock and forty-seven seconds, right on the dot. The sun fallen below the inky horizon with the stars glimmering through a veil of clouds, the slush frozen over into ice on the streets, and Sirius bangs through the front door like a human hurricane, like lives and pumpkin pie are on the line. If Moody could see this, he\u2019d start paying Remus to hide in various rooms of the Auror training headquarters every morning; Sirius would show up with half an hour at least to spare, and possibly breakfast for everyone.</p>\n<p>\u201cHello,\u201d says Remus, slightly breathless on the sofa. He\u2019s got his knees folded beside him and a book in his lap he isn\u2019t looking at; the only thing he seems to see at all is Sirius, his hand flexing slightly on his thigh, light catching the ends of his hair. \u201cHow was the rest of your day?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDisgusting,\u201d he says. He still hasn\u2019t managed to get his boots off, because that would mean looking away from Remus. \u201cIt felt like a <em>month</em>, Moony, I haven\u2019t had food or drink or\u2014or anything.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd last I heard, two-thirds of your organ systems were already failing,\u201d says Remus, setting his book down absently and crossing the room, watching Sirius watching him on their worn-out shoe mat. \u201cWe\u2019d better do something about that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s getting pretty dire,\u201d says Sirius, his belly trembling as Remus comes closer, and closer, taking the ends of his scarf between his fingertips. \u201cIn fact, I think the length of my recovery is directly proportional to the time I spend snogging you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIs that so,\u201d murmurs Remus, pulling gently on his scarf until his nose brushes Sirius\u2019 ear. \u201cThis is me warning you,\u201d he whispers, tight and frantic. Sirius kisses him before Remus can beat him to it this time, slower, softer than the first few, his heart swelling up against Remus\u2019 hands sliding up his chest. It is, he thinks distantly, the best kiss he\u2019s ever had in his life.</p>\n<p>Remus pulls away after a few moments, and Sirius leans forward with him, clutching him around the ribs. He can feel him breathing, can feel the warm muted lines of his waist down to his hips, straight rather than curved inward like a woman\u2019s. He likes both\u2014the sloping curls, the flow of edges, soft bulges too\u2014but there\u2019s something about this, the feel of another man\u2019s muscles and bones moving under his hands, that Sirius <em>loves</em>.</p>\n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s leftover soup,\u201d says Remus, his voice gone a little rough. Sirius kisses him again, quickly, just for the thrill of it\u2014just because he can. \u201cAre you feeling better?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou saved my life, Doctor Professor Lupin. Saved it with your wanton slaggish ways,\u201d he says. \u201cHere, let me help you\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGet your shoes off. We can eat in the sitting room, it\u2019s warmer in there anyway.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd there is a sofa,\u201d says Sirius, not losing sight of what\u2019s important.</p>\n<p>Dinner is much the same as it always is, but <em>brilliant</em> somehow, tilted just right, like a crooked still life hanging over the mantel that he\u2019s straightened and finally, finally fallen into. Sirius revels in every laugh and every smile Remus pulls out of him, loves even the angular stretch of tension that catches in their throats over vegetable soup, all of it so new and raw and beautiful; Remus gets pepper up his nose and sneezes violently, and Sirius starts laughing because it\u2019s the funniest thing, <em>ever</em>, because nothing is more perfect than his knee next to Remus\u2019 knee, his voice twining around Remus\u2019 voice, their soup bowls stacked together. He wants to set himself against Remus; he wants to move with Remus, wants to feel both of them alive in their own skin, wants to learn all the different ways they fit together. He wants.</p>\n<p>F-A-M-I-N-E. Twenty-three down on today\u2019s crossword, two blood-dark, voracious syllables howling with an ancient hunger. Beside him, Remus swallows, runs a hand along his thigh; Sirius wants to touch him.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, those,\u201d says Sirius, coming back from the washing up just as the Muggle news comes back on. \u201cMuggles and their sky trollies,\u201d he mutters when he sits back down, just for the way it makes Remus clench his teeth. \u201cLook at them! It downright incredible, I mean, they can launch hundreds of tons of metal and human life into the sky and it\u2019s fucking <em>amazing</em> and no one talks about it except to complain about the seats or whatever, but the second you mention flying broomsticks it\u2019s off to therapy for the next two years.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMuggles are a bit obtuse about these things, but, y\u2019know, not being magical, they\u2019ve got their reasons.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI know all about that, too.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh?\u201d Remus lifts one eyebrow. Sirius\u2019 elbows tingle briefly for some reason, and he wonders if that\u2019s another factor that comes with being attracted to boys or if it\u2019s just Remus playing havoc with various parts of his body again.</p>\n<p>\u201cThey\u2019ve got to compensate,\u201d he says, \u201cfor not having dishwashing spells and the like. They think Merlin is a myth, so they invent men who stomp down chimneys at Christmas in carriages drawn by flying centaurs instead. They think baby teeth are a delicacy for fairies and they don\u2019t believe in mopping their movie theaters but no, oh no, straddling a broom for a living is weird. It\u2019s right <em>bizarre</em> is what it is, Moony.\u201d</p>\n<p>Remus makes a sound halfway between a laugh and a sigh, leaning back against the couch. \u201cI don\u2019t really have it in me to explain everything that\u2019s wrong with what you just said.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBecause you can\u2019t refute it, that\u2019s why,\u201d says Sirius, leaning back with him and turning his head sideways to meet his eyes. \u201cYou\u2019re disqualified! I win.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd what do you think you ought to win for that shameful display, hmm?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHow about,\u201d he starts, licking his lips, his blood heating in his chest, \u201chow about I kiss your face and we call it even, since you\u2019re such a graceless loser?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSpeaking of certain things,\u201d says Remus, \u201cthere are people out there who think we\u2019re going to hell for this, and worse. In case you spent that hour of Muggle Studies behind the greenhouses, too.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sirius, unconcerned with going to hell, leans in and drags his lips across the tiny scar on Remus\u2019 cheek and down to the corner of his mouth, feeling Remus smile against him, warm as sunrise. \u201cI actually find that extremely attractive,\u201d he says, pushing off the couch to straddle Remus\u2019 hips tentatively, or as tentatively as you can do this at all\u2014it\u2019s sort of an all-or-nothing kind of deal. He\u2019s never done this before. He\u2019s had girls do it to <em>him</em> and he\u2019s liked it plenty, but he\u2019s never tried it on anyone else; miraculously, he doesn\u2019t feel anything like lumpy or awkward, and Remus is running his hands up his forearms to his elbows, eyes brighter than the flat-edged moon filling up in the sky, so he reckons he\u2019s doing something right.</p>\n<p>\u201cIs this\u2014\u201d Remus curls his hands around Sirius\u2019 elbows, shy and shaky, a sudden tensing of his shoulders like birdflight under Sirius\u2019 fingers. \u201cIs this all right?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIs this all right,\u201d Sirius growls at his jaw, feeling his breath hitch. \u201cThis is fucking <em>perfect</em>, Remus,\u201d he says, and kisses him breathless, wonderingly, thrillingly hard as Remus, fluid as tide beneath their crumpled winter stars.</p>\n<p>The rest of the evening is a flood of kissing and touching and bad television-watching until bed, which makes Sirius\u2019 stomach bottom out for entirely different reasons than it did this afternoon, his head swimming with threads of all the things they could do, and whether they <em>should</em> do them, and whether he even knows exactly <em>how</em> to do them. Flipping through Remus\u2019 books to distract himself is only marginally helpful; he can\u2019t find anything dirty, though he knows there must be some lying about, probably shoved inconspicuously between one of his huge history books. Maybe there are pictures. Maybe there are step-by-step guides.</p>\n<p>Maybe there are <em>diagrams</em>.</p>\n<p>In the end, though, all he can find is some exceedingly nasty French poetry that Remus would probably still try to argue has lots of inherent artistic value in its lurid, loving detail of male genitalia.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s sitting on the edge of Remus\u2019 bed, feet slightly sweaty, debating whether or not to light a cigarette and lounge back on the pillows when Remus comes in and say something delicate and subtle like, <em>Hey, Remus, want to have sex?</em> when the door squeaks shut on its hinges, and there he is, all mismatched socks and damp, uncombed hair, shirt buttoned up all the way, rubbing lavender-smelling lotion into his dry knuckles and sneezing over it for the seventeenth time tonight.</p>\n<p>This is the man you have chosen, Sirius Black, he thinks, a heavy, clear happiness suddenly fighting it out with the nervousness twinging in his belly. Remus smiles at him, surprised and exultant and trying so hard to fold it away in his mouth and keep it from showing too much, like Sirius isn\u2019t going to pull him down and find it there, anyway.</p>\n<p>\u201cI seem to have an unreasonably attractive man on my bed,\u201d says Remus, coming closer until Sirius wraps his hands around his hips, pulling him down. \u201cDid\u2014have you been going through my books?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat makes you think that?\u201d he mumbles into the fabric of Remus\u2019 shirt. His chest swells and deflates under Sirius\u2019 mouth.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re\u2014oh Christ,\u201d he says, looking down and finding the filthy, dog-eared evidence. \u201cYou know, that poem\u2019s an allegory for\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe only thing that\u2019s an allegory for is how much he wanted an illicit blowjob.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, okay,\u201d Remus admits, leaning over to put it on the nightstand. When he turns back, delightfully pink, he bites his lip and runs his thumb over the bump of bone on Sirius\u2019 wrist, pressing his forehead against Sirius\u2019, their hair all tangled up. \u201cWe don\u2019t\u2014we don\u2019t have to. You know.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSex, Remus,\u201d he says, hearing Remus\u2019 hard swallow. \u201cSex! Sex sex SEX. Can you even say it?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Yes</em>,\u201d he snaps. \u201cI just don\u2019t want you to feel like you have to.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat, like you <em>have</em>?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, you stupid berk, it\u2019s only\u2014I want you to be\u2014I want it to be <em>right</em>. Is all.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sirius kisses the tired places underneath his eyes and pulls him down on top of him, heavy and flannel-warm when he kisses him. \u201cYou\u2019re fucking <em>lovely</em>,\u201d he tells Remus, slipping his fingers beneath his shirt and feeling him shiver over him, mouth parted and wet, eyes on Sirius, only Sirius. It makes him feel wanted\u2014makes him feel braver, reckless. When he shifts his thigh underneath Remus and presses it between his legs, Remus gasps into his mouth, drags their hips together slowly, both of them hissing at the electric friction surging through their skin.</p>\n<p>\u201cGod, I\u2019m\u2014I\u2019ve got no idea what I\u2019m doing,\u201d Remus breathes, gripping Sirius\u2019 hip hard, his knuckles yellow-white in the shadows of the bed.</p>\n<p>\u201cNeither do I,\u201d says Sirius. He bends his knees around Remus and thrusts upward against Remus\u2019, his belly trembling hotly when groans into his neck and grazes his teeth along the pulse there, frantic-fast, beating for him. \u201cSo don\u2019t stop, oh, <em>don\u2019t</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>Ragged-rough and slow, the rhythm they fall into, heat and pressure and the sweet, intimate push-and-pull of their bodies moving together until Sirius comes suddenly like a surprise: He gasps, kissing Remus irregularly and saying something stupid and possibly important, and then Remus follows, tensing, biting his mouth, groaning Sirius\u2019 name like a charm\u2014like a poem knitted from memory, long-held, reverent.</p>\n<p>In the muzzy afterwards, once they\u2019ve shut off the lights again and taken care of the mess that comes from not bothering to remove clothes, Remus presses close to him under the quilt just as Sirius reaches for him, burying his face in his hair, shaken loose with pleasure and newness and wide awake with the strange immense joy of themselves, unfurling.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat was nice,\u201d says Remus, smiling into his shoulder.</p>\n<p>\u201cMy God, is that all you\u2019ve got to say for yourself?\u201d asks Sirius. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you what it was, since I obviously completely blew your mind: It was absolutely bloody amazing. Is what.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou liked it, then?\u201d</p>\n<p>He loved it. Whatever he was expecting\u2014something similar to what he\u2019d done with Mary Macdonald, which was soft and slick and enjoyable enough, if underwhelming\u2014wasn\u2019t quite this, the jumbled closeness and the heavy warmth of it. He never wants to get up from this bed.</p>\n<p>Which is the sort of thing that\u2019s probably important to say, so he does. \u201cI loved it,\u201d he says, and kisses Remus on the bridge of his nose; he figures he\u2019s allowed to do that now. Remus smiles with all his teeth on the pillow they\u2019re sharing, watching him happily, wonderingly.</p>\n<p>\u201cMe, too,\u201d says Remus, an arm around his ribs, his ankles wedged under one of Sirius\u2019 legs.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou realize we could have been doing this for ages now, if you\u2019d just said you wanted to be my\u2014\u201d he pauses, unsure.</p>\n<p>\u201cBoyfriend,\u201d Remus finishes for him, looking surprised and thrilled, secretly, with how easily it comes to him. \u201cPlease, please don\u2019t call me your partner, it makes me feel like I\u2019m an eighty-year-old retired man herding sheep in Shropshire.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou want to be my <em>boyfriend</em>,\u201d Sirius trills, kissing him again. \u201cYou and Lily will meet up for coffee and do whatever ponce-y things the two of you do and sigh over the horrible men in your lives, drinking the milk straight out of the carton and leaving the seat up.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve been doing that for two years, I just wasn\u2019t having sex with you,\u201d says Remus. \u201cYou <em>haven\u2019t</em> been drinking it straight from the carton, have you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBelieve me, cupcake, I learned my lesson with the peanut butter.\u201d He closes his eyes, smoothing Remus\u2019 hair out with his fingers, sleep finally beginning to sink into him; at his chest, Remus breathes, long and even. \u201cI think I\u2019m getting places,\u201d he says quietly, shifting when Remus peers up at him from the frizzy fringe of his hair.</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he answers. \u201cI\u2019m not <em>sure</em>, I mean, not yet, but\u2014closer.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI think,\u201d says Remus, brushing his fingers along Sirius\u2019 collarbone, \u201cit\u2019s a matter of what you find yourself attracted to\u2014what you question, and how often. The answer is a lot different for a lot of people.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBoth,\u201d says Sirius, \u201cabout equally. I think. But it\u2019s different for\u2014oh, bugger, I don\u2019t fucking know,\u201d he says, gliding his bare foot against Remus\u2019 fuzzy sock-covered foot. \u201cI just know I\u2019ll always be here when you wake up.\u201d</p>\n<p>Remus\u2019 lips are warm against his own, filling in their spaces. Outside, the moon claws against the frosted window with serrated fingers, violent-pale; Sirius holds his hand over Remus\u2019 heart.</p>\n<p>\u2014</p>\n<p>A whole week, then, of little but snow and settling in, both of them falling into their tiny house and into each other like a warm front. They kiss over breakfast, in the bathroom, in the doorway, pile on more blankets and sleep without their pyjamas, learn the art of tying themselves together. Sirius brings home dark chocolate truffles and takeout Remus warns him is too hot and endures both tears and Remus\u2019 poorly disguised laughter as he eats; Remus reads him the best stories from the newspaper and leaves the bag in Sirius\u2019 tea every time he makes it. They string up tacky garland and hang a juniper wreath on the door, and Sirius, never one to let the holiday go without, presses sprigs of mistletoe between the pages of the books Remus is reading, waits for him to find them. He\u2019s repaid in full (and sometimes more) at the most inopportune times: brushing his teeth, his hands full of grocery bags, having a crisis while cleaning out the fireplace and up to his elbows in ashes.</p>\n<p>They sink down into their own territory where only they know the footing. Outside this house, there\u2019s work and the Order and the treacherous, bloodstained battleground of adulthood, but here, when it\u2019s them and them alone, Sirius can be as young as he really is. He can be happy for newsprint miracles and teabags left in, for the way the two of them grow between the cracks in the concrete. He can breathe.</p>\n<p>On Sunday, the air holding blue in the midafternoon chill, they go off in search of the biggest Christmas tree in the village, wandering between rows of pine needles and snow drifts in their boots while Remus makes quietly disapproving noises at the logistics of getting one through the front door. It\u2019s when they cross paths with another couple, and then another, that Sirius realizes: Wow, there are a lot of straight people here.</p>\n<p>He amends: Probably not <em>all</em> of them are straight. But it\u2019s jarring, in a way, to know that no one would ever doubt for a moment that they\u2019ve both got their names on the house title and they share the same bed, the same Gringotts account, the same history. They\u2019ll never have to worry about a Pureblood telling them to stop screwing around; they\u2019ll never have all the things they\u2019ve grown and shaped and bled for and nourished with all the love there is inside them invalidated, diminished.</p>\n<p>People will look at them and see True Love and The Spirit of the Season, or something. They\u2019ll look at him and Remus and see two good friends or roommates until they\u2019re told otherwise.</p>\n<p>They don\u2019t have to wonder where all their happy endings are.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re awfully quiet,\u201d says Remus. His nose is very red. \u201cHow about this one?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s missing half its stuffing in the middle, Moony.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI think it\u2019s sweet,\u201d he sniffs. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s just that\u2014have you noticed,\u201d he says, dropping his voice, \u201cwe are the only couple here who don\u2019t look like we belong on the cover of <em>Witch Weekly</em>?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDoes that bother you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo. I just forget sometimes, I guess.\u201d He reaches for Remus\u2019 hand, only to find Remus already reaching for his; he wraps his fingers around the coarse mittens, pulls him close. \u201c<em>This</em> one.\u201d</p>\n<p>A smile, a sigh. \u201cSirius, that\u2019s bigger than our ceiling.\u201d He falls gently into Sirius\u2019 side like a bolster. \u201cCould you see yourself doing that? Being all, y\u2019know\u2014married to a woman, babies, Christmas photos every year, matching bathroom towels?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, because too much of that and you end up on a greeting card and then you\u2019re an empty husk of a man before the age of thirty,\u201d he says, steering Remus to the next row of trees. \u201cBut\u2014yeah. Without the husky emptiness, and all. I could see that.\u201d He thinks of Remus, thinks of Kingsley Shacklebolt\u2019s slow smiles, his sculpted abdominals, his strong, capable, knee-weakening voice. \u201cI could see it just as easily with a man. So\u2014I guess that means bisexual, after all. I am four whole syllables, Moony.\u201d</p>\n<p>It surprises him, how fast the realization crashes into him. It\u2019s like tripwire: snagged around the ankles, the snap, the fall, and then the click\u2014detonation. He\u2019s got no real preference, but he\u2019s got <em>Remus</em>, and Sirius aims to keep him.</p>\n<p>\u201cI can see it with you,\u201d he says. He leans over and kisses him, soft and sweet, their own happy conclusion. Remus doesn\u2019t let go of his hand. \u201cIt was always going to happen,\u201d he murmurs when he pulls back. \u201cI\u2019ve dipped my toes in the lake of Remus Lupin and there\u2019s no going back now, honey muffin. We were on a collision course.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cA three-year collision course with a lot of near-misses and a lot of debris smacking into us,\u201d says Remus, running a mitten along his elbow. \u201cThere\u2014this is a good one, look, it\u2019ll fit right in front of the window and it won\u2019t scrape the ceiling.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd it\u2019s <em>weak</em>. Look at that flimsy trunk, it won\u2019t even survive its first night of eggnog and pudding.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt will if you don\u2019t get sloshed beyond all reason this year.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got no spirit,\u201d he scoffs, \u201cnone at all. Honestly! Asking a man not to get sloshed at Christmas is like asking Jesus not to die or Muggles not to worship electricity.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s like asking Sirius Black not to forget he\u2019s already spiked the eggnog.\u201d</p>\n<p>Halfway down another row, a young couple passes by them, two women with a small baby wrapped up in enough wintery cloaking to clothe a family of seven; Sirius smiles at them, and his thoughts, same as they\u2019ve always done, circle around to Remus, and Remus with a baby, and Remus reading bedtime stories, the two of them taking turns rocking a crying bundle back to sleep during long December midnights. He\u2019s a little distressed\u2014pleasantly so\u2014to find that it\u2019s not an unappealing thought, and then gives himself a few firm mental slaps because who the hell is he, <em>James</em>? He hasn\u2019t cultivated this crusty rebellious exterior just for Remus Lupin to crack it like a coconut and gush all over his shoes, and yet.</p>\n<p>He imagines getting older with Remus, and older. Imagines coming back here every year, taking an inordinate amount of time to find a perfect Christmas tree, just like this. Imagines them in an old brick house with loads of ivy and a garden and maybe a pond full of overgrowth, room enough for all their cluttered dreams and their jagged parts and all the bright, beautiful things they can build between them. The sun washes Remus\u2019 hair red and gold and copper, pools under his eyes; Sirius squeezes his hand.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis,\u201d he says suddenly, \u201cthis is it, Remus, this is my final answer and if you don\u2019t like this one, you\u2019ve got no soul and there\u2019s no hope for you. I\u2019m going to roll it up and take it home.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHmm.\u201d Remus drops his hand and walks around the tree, surveying the height, the quality of its deep pine-green. It\u2019s tall and wide and full at the bottom, sturdy enough to endure a night of heinous overindulgence. \u201cOh, what, you\u2019ve got that look about the mouth again. What are you thinking about?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou,\u201d he says.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh.\u201d Then, \u201cAm I naked yet?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re wearing those underwear with the holly right now. I\u2019m working on it but you\u2019re being a real tricky slag about the whole thing,\u201d says Sirius.</p>\n<p>\u201cAsk me if I\u2019d like some cocoa and biscuits. Don\u2019t give up, old boy, you\u2019re a Gryffindor.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cActually, I\u2019m thinking about you washing nappies and heating bottles.\u201d</p>\n<p>Remus peeks out at him from behind the tree, eyes and mouth alike wide and shocked and, he thinks, touched for reasons that are obviously causing him some nasty stomach turmoil. \u201cI can\u2019t even deal with <em>flobberworms</em>,\u201d he sputters, voice breaking slightly. Sirius takes the high road and doesn\u2019t mention it.</p>\n<p>\u201cA baby is basically one enormous flobberworm, only they cry and they look nicer,\u201d says Sirius. Remus grabs onto the tree; yes, definitely sturdy enough. \u201cI mean, I just\u2014I don\u2019t know. Can you even imagine me with a baby? It\u2019s probably like imagining me in tweed or something.\u201d</p>\n<p>Regaining some of his composure, Remus takes a deep breath to temper the hysteria and lets go of the tree, still watching him with his eyes full of something like wonder, and uncertainty, and a lot like yearning. \u201cActually, I can,\u201d he says quietly after a moment, coming around the front of the tree again. \u201cI think you\u2019d be good with them. Dora never wants to leave when Andromeda brings her over and that\u2019s even when we don\u2019t have cheesecake.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s because Dora lives in Shropshire and Shropshire\u2019s full of naught but dry grass and soggy toast.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut you\u2019re good with her,\u201d Remus presses, biting his lower lip. \u201cMaybe\u2014maybe we can get a goldfish and work our way up.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOr a toad, though that might be overachieving a bit,\u201d says Sirius, pushing Remus\u2019 hair out of his eyes with gloved fingers. \u201cSo. Are we taking it home? Pleeeease, Moony, please don\u2019t crush my poor fragile heart under your heels.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCheck for small animals, please.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sirius bends down to look up the tree branches and shakes it gently by the trunk to make sure there are no surprises hiding in the lower branches until Remus is satisfied, smiling at him when he comes out and winding his long fingers around his scarf, plucking pine needles off his coat. \u201cLook at you, you damn lovely thing,\u201d he says into Sirius\u2019 ear, and then kisses him as the wind rumbles in through the trees, as he falls into Sirius\u2019 arms.</p>\n<p>How perfect it would be, he thinks, to always have this, just the way he wants\u2014to be able to put his arms around Remus and feel him breathing here against him, to come home to him, wait up for him, fall asleep and wake up with him for the rest of his life. To have his whole head and his heart full, and all his mismatched parts fastened together as tightly as he knows how; to maybe someday be able to lie in bed and ask Remus if he remembers their first kiss, their first Christmas, their first New Year. To have everything that\u2019s worth having\u2014a gust of wind to push them into each other\u2019s arms, their stars fixed in the sky.</p>\n<p>\u2014</p>\n<p>Two days after the full moon, the sky cloudless and agony-emptied, he wakes from an early afternoon nap with a blanket wrapped around his shoulders and the other half of the bed cold, Remus finally up and gone to shower without nudging him awake. Glancing at the clock on the nightstand and swearing fluently, he hurls himself out of the bed he\u2019s starting to think of as <em>theirs</em> rather than just Remus\u2019 and tries desperately to make his hair stop sticking up for all of eight seconds before he gives up, tugging on a pair of socks from the dresser that used to sit in his bedroom and now stands opposite Remus\u2019, right where it belongs among the teetering piles of books and parchment and the disassembled components of Muggle electronics he likes to take apart and learn, sometimes charm back together again. He\u2019s stripped his bed of the quilt and pillows, shoved his robes and Oxfords beside Remus\u2019 in the closet; they\u2019ve made a nest of it here, grown their own borders to protect.</p>\n<p>At the bathroom door, he knocks loud enough that Remus can hear over the shower and walks in, searching the drawers for the single neglected hairbrush between them Sirius has had since roughly 1973. \u201cI\u2019m going to the pharmacy for more pain-reducing things no one trusts me to make, and also Weetabix because you need your fiber,\u201d he says, immediately getting the brush snagged in his hair. \u201cBugger <em>fuck</em>. Do you want\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>The curtain rattles on the rod; when he turns around, Remus is staring out from behind one of the giraffes on the plastic, holding it strategically and very deliberately in front of half his body, looking daft and disheveled and absolutely fucking gorgeous. Sirius\u2019 whole body goes still as summer heat.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell. Hello there,\u201d he says, grinning smooth as a knife, messy hair and pharmacy trips and Wizarding wars pushed to the very back of his brain with all the other unimportant things in the face of the far more critical situation: Remus, naked. \u201cLook at you, all\u2026 naked and wet.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m very damp,\u201d says Remus. \u201cWere you even going to disconnect the Floo before you left? Anyone could walk in here and see my bits.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPete would just turn magenta and make fun of the curtain and come back later. Prongs would light a cigarette and ask to watch, and probably so would Lily. They\u2019re sad, pitiful people but they\u2019re harmless.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSounds about right.\u201d Remus bunches the curtain up lower, lower; Sirius can see the water dripping off his hair and onto his shoulders, rolling down his arms. \u201cIt\u2019s a little cold in here, Padfoot, I think I\u2019m still a bit shaky from the other night. It\u2019s so\u2026 quiet.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBet it\u2019s lonely,\u201d says Sirius, leaning against the wall, \u201call by yourself, all soapy around the thighs.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHorrible,\u201d Remus nods, smiling shyly and lowering his eyes for a moment, making Sirius\u2019 belly clench, his heart jolting into a new rhythm in his chest. \u201cI\u2019ve been reading the backs of the shampoo bottles.\u201d</p>\n<p>A single stray drop of water flies from the shower and onto Sirius\u2019 shirt, darkening the fabric. He stares at it. \u201cOh no,\u201d he says, his eyes locking onto Remus\u2019 again, unblinking.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh no.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNow I\u2019ve got to burn it,\u201d he says.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re unclean,\u201d Remus cautions, reaching a wet hand out to fist around his shoulder. \u201cYou\u2019d better get in. Right now.\u201d</p>\n<p>Amazing, he thinks, how the thought of this would have ruptured something catastrophic just a year ago; how it would have frightened him as much as it pulled at his limbs even as he desperately, endlessly craved this sort of closeness with Remus, the solidity of his arms around him, his body with Remus\u2019 body like it belongs there. Sirius slots their hips and shoulders together like puzzle pieces and kisses him, kisses him, kisses him.</p>\n<p>Later\u2014far, far later than he\u2019d intended\u2014he\u2019s standing in line at the pharmacy with Weetabix and pain potions and some Muggle chocolate, sliding a London newspaper across the counter mostly for the crossword when he thinks, strangely, that it\u2019s a little warmer than he remembers it being when he left. He breathes in, dittany and cinnamon and vanilla; everything is smoother, softer, like a bright watercolor blurring sweetly at the edges, connected with slim silver threads.</p>\n<p>\u201cSick girlfriend?\u201d the man at the counter asks him, smiling sympathetically over the potions.</p>\n<p>And this is part of it too, part of the wrinkles in the equation Remus isn\u2019t here to help him iron out. He\u2019s bought potions and magazines and bandages and plastic Muggle trinkets he swears are for Dora from this same man for years now: He can\u2019t gauge whether he\u2019ll get a patented Pureblood eye-roll, and thus risk arrest for putting him through the wall, which Sirius really doesn\u2019t want to do because he <em>likes</em> the guy; or, possibly he\u2019ll ring him up and say nothing else, and Sirius will walk away with a small sting between the eyes, and go out of his way to the other pharmacy for a while.</p>\n<p>The nervous mind is truly a marvel, its neurons firing chaotically in a split second to take you\u2014in great detail\u2014through all the different ways things can go wrong, and all the winding, thorny paths you sometimes tread to avoid confrontation.</p>\n<p>\u201cBoyfriend, actually,\u201d says Sirius. It makes something well up inside him, velvet-dark and brilliant, just to say it.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s another smile then, blue eyes scrunched up cheerfully behind his glasses. \u201cLucky man,\u201d says the cashier, \u201che gets the seventy percent dark. That\u2019s devotion.\u201d</p>\n<p>On the way out, one hand on the doorknob and a paper bag for Remus in the other, he realizes just how often he\u2019s done this, newspapers and chocolate and healing spells murmured in the shrill glass shards of countless dawns, how many times his feet have taken him, automatically, through these same streets, the same doors, led him, always, to Remus. Outside, in the yellow sweep of the sun, Sirius can feel his heart beating with something almost tangible, flooding him like knowledge: a word, a word, a word.</p>\n<p>Oh, he thinks, a mouth like thunder. <em>Oh</em>. There are names for this.</p>\n<p>There are names for this.</p>\n<p>\u2014</p>\n<p>Possibly his favorite Christmas tradition\u2014though he\u2019s not sure it\u2019s quite right to call two years a <em>tradition</em> just yet\u2014is dinner with Marlene and Dorcas, where it\u2019s not so much a proper Christmas dinner as it is an entire spread of appetizers and biscuits and foods that are absolutely horrible for you, where they don\u2019t eat at the table like civilized human beings, but in the sitting room like a picnic, and where they all drink cheap champagne the whole night through like it\u2019s a sin. It\u2019s the antithesis of his childhood, a sort of perverse potluck featuring everything from Muggle crisps to treacle tart and Dorcas\u2019 weird port-wine cheeseballs; they bring mashed potatoes and Honeydukes chocolate and eat in front of the fire, and Remus is just getting all flappy and overexcited the way Sirius loves as he explains Muggle literature to Dorcas when Marlene tugs him outside for a cigarette, lighting her own before she\u2019s even out of the sitting room.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re so soppy I don\u2019t know how you\u2019re not leaking all over the carpet,\u201d she tells him, flicking ash and grinning. On anyone else, it would be insufferable; on Marlene, it makes him smile. \u201cI told you, didn\u2019t I? Let\u2019s hear it, Black\u2014out with it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFuck off,\u201d he says brightly, taking a drag and watching the tip catch. The sun\u2019s already gone down between the cramped houses, the stars flickering like candles; Sirius glances at Marlene and swallows. \u201cHow did you know?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been sleeping with him and mooning over him and probably crying into your pillow over him for God knows how long and you\u2019re seriously\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHow did you know you were in love with her?\u201d</p>\n<p>All the white-hot incredulity fades from her face, softened, quietly, into understanding, into happiness; Marlene McKinnon, she of the gale-force voice and solid steel ovaries, wraps an arm around his waist and hugs him tightly. \u201cThat\u2019s really a much easier question,\u201d she says. Her eyes are bluer and brighter than a summertime sea, gone midnight-rich with memory. \u201cIf you\u2019re asking it, you\u2019re already up to your eyeballs.\u201d</p>\n<p>Smoking his cigarette down to the filter while the stars glimmer gold, while he knows there\u2019s someone waiting on him inside, someone who has been waiting on him for the better part of their lives now, he thinks she\u2019s right; he thinks, probably, that the moment you let yourselves think it, the moment you let yourselves want it, you are probably just as truly and deeply in love as two people have ever been or will ever be.</p>\n<p>And Sirius Black has always been at least a little in love with Remus Lupin.</p>\n<p>\u2014</p>\n<p>Christmas Eve, the fire built up high in the hearth, and Sirius comes in from one last cigarette to the smell of cinnamon and thick, spicy-sweet pudding on the kitchen counter, assuming Remus has already gone to bed only to find him still sitting on the sofa, an enormous and doubtlessly boring book balanced on the arm, absorbed and oblivious.</p>\n<p>This means, in the dialect of Remus Lupin, one of two things:</p>\n<p>1. He is waiting for Sirius, or</p>\n<p>2. He is actually interested in what he\u2019s reading.</p>\n<p>Sirius likes Option Number One.</p>\n<p>Sliding in beside him, Sirius presses his nose\u2014cold\u2014into the crook of his neck and trails a hand\u2014also cold\u2014underneath his jumper, feeling him tense and jump at the touch as he spins around, yelping, to glare at him.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat the hell have you been <em>doing</em>, sitting in the cold cupboard?\u201d he stammers. \u201cI\u2019m trying to read. I think I was trying to read the <em>last</em> time you flopped all over me, too.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou were. It was the same book,\u201d says Sirius, his hands warming with Remus\u2019 skin, feeling him relax into it, just slightly. \u201cWhich ought to tell you it\u2019s not that interesting and you\u2019re just not as into Dumas as, y\u2019know, <em>me</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOr maybe it\u2019s because I\u2019ve been interrupted every time I\u2019ve tried to get through it.\u201d</p>\n<p>In the fathomless, tangled cords of their shared history, Sirius has learned to play this game and he\u2019s learned to play it like a professional sport: Remus will only <em>really</em> choose a book or work or other sundry responsibilities over his friends if the promises of uncharted territory or something horribly illegal or food or, recently, sex, are immediately presented as inherently superior options, and he as a soggy blanket for not jumping at the chance. They have to be dangled in front of him like bait, a glimpse of chocolate held in outstretched fingers, before he\u2019ll leap\u2014and galvanize. Over the years, Sirius has taught himself to read Remus like a weathervane, all his wavering, all his faltering, all his nail-chewing indecision.</p>\n<p>Remus taps his index finger against the spine of the book; he is faltering.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s a whole lot of pages,\u201d says Sirius, leaning just a little closer; his hair brushes Remus\u2019 cheek. \u201cMore than even the sturdiest of Prefects could reasonably expect to get through in a single night, determined though he may be.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s a very good book,\u201d Remus answers. His heartbeat has stuttered and fallen into a new meter, just a tiny, silent misstep imperceptible to anyone but Sirius. \u201cI can\u2019t sleep until I know what happens.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cEnthralling, is it,\u201d mutters Sirius, grazing his knuckles along the waistband of his pyjamas and making him shiver. \u201cJust makes your heart <em>pound</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>Letting out a shaky breath, Remus tightens his grip on the arm of the sofa, staring determinedly down at the letters, unseeing. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of incredible symbolism in this one. I think you might like it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t turned a page in three minutes,\u201d says Sirius, dragging his lips across Remus\u2019 ear, one hand splayed across his belly, fingers stroking up his ribs. It\u2019s a head-rush, this shared breath, the way he\u2019s learned to touch Remus, the way it feels to want and be wanted. To always want the world to be beautiful for someone.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m savoring every word,\u201d says Remus. Sirius can feel his iron resolve crumbling up like aluminum foil.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo you\u2019re not.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m going to read it <em>all night</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not wearing any underwear,\u201d he hisses, and then the book slams shut like a benediction, shoved violently aside on the end table, and he\u2019s being dragged down the hallway by his shirt, laughing and laughing.</p>\n<p>His pyjamas are still on by the time they get to the bed, which trips Remus up; he falls hard, and Sirius pulls his trousers off and runs his palms up his thighs to his hips, pressing his mouth to his belly and feeling it flutter under his lips, soft and salty-warm like the rest of him. He kisses his ribs, grinning against his hip at the gasp that rips out of Remus\u2019 throat when he wraps a hand around his cock and strokes slowly, teeth scraping across his hipbone.</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you <em>sure</em> you don\u2019t want to finish your book?\u201d he whispers, sitting back on his heels and kissing the inside of Remus\u2019 knee. \u201cI won\u2019t mind too much, you know. We can just\u2014put this off.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve already finished it twice,\u201d Remus laughs, naked yearning stark in the light of his eyes, breaking off the moment Sirius\u2019 mouth slides over his cock, one hand scrabbling for his hair as Sirius moves up and down along the length of it. There\u2019s something about this he loves, the way Remus watches him, how he grates out his name, breathless and dream-sharp, when he flattens his tongue underneath and curls it around the very tip; he\u2019d thought about this a lot before he ever did it, but the fact of it\u2014the soft taste of him, his breathing changing for Sirius, the intense thrill of it, sparking always between them both\u2014is something his Highly Educational Reading Material didn\u2019t mention.</p>\n<p>In fact, his Highly Educational Reading Material didn\u2019t cover a lot of things beyond the bare mechanics. Like how squishy and awkward and terrifying it can be at first; how it\u2019s a language like any other with a syntax and structure, how much better it is if you\u2019re doing it with someone who can make you laugh. How much better it\u2019s going to get, in general.</p>\n<p>Nothing tells you all the ways it will transform, all the ways you\u2019ll learn to navigate yourself and someone else: Remus\u2019 hands pulling him up, touching him as if he\u2019s starved for his skin and his heart, wide-open, leaving heavy heat-strokes across the jut of his shoulders, his ribs, the curve of his spine. He drags Sirius between his legs and gasps, and Sirius, looking down at him with his eyes half-closed and his heart in his mouth, kisses him hard and hopes he can taste the things that are singing in his blood, all the things that begin and end with Remus, stacked like verse on his tongue.</p>\n<p>\u201cTake your fucking socks off,\u201d he half-groans, teeth at Remus\u2019 jaw.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d laughs Remus, grinding their hips together, making him hiss, \u201cmy feet are cold.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou look like the world\u2019s biggest plonker,\u201d says Sirius. \u201cI\u2019ll warm you up.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSuch confidence.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSays the man wearing whimsical snowman socks.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThis man,\u201d says Remus, sly and deliberate, \u201cwill have warm feet if the other man fails to deliver.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sirius presses his mouth over Remus\u2019 pulse and sucks gently the way he\u2019s learned he likes best, one hand clasped around his hip and the other at his shoulder, feeling him moan low in his throat. \u201cMoony, <em>Moony</em>, you are about take the mood and back over it with an eighteen-wheeler.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTake them off,\u201d he gasps, and Sirius, laughing, does.</p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t think he\u2019ll ever have enough of this, the way he falls so easily into Remus and moves with him, their bodies tangled tight, taking each other into a rhythm that\u2019s becoming familiar, building hard-fast in their blood. Remus wraps his legs around his waist and takes him in deeper, pressing a hand to his cheek and turning his head to look at him, flushed and gasping suddenly when he meets his eyes.</p>\n<p>\u201cSirius,\u201d he chokes out hoarsely. His eyes tear open the dark. \u201c<em>Sirius</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you warm enough yet,\u201d he murmurs, rubbing a hand up from the smooth dip in Remus\u2019 hip to his chest and resting his forehead against Remus\u2019, breathing with him, feeling the red swell of his pulse in his own skin; he can\u2019t look away.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d he moans, \u201cGod, <em>yes</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI can get you some shoes.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShut up,\u201d he laughs, and kisses him\u2014wonderingly, perfectly slow.</p>\n<p>\u201cRemus.\u201d He smiles at the way his name feels on his tongue, half-gasped and low like a secret as their hips move, rhythm building faster, roughness and softness and heat; he presses it to Remus\u2019 mouth and feels him swallow it, watches his face shifting when he wraps a hand around his cock, his mouth opening, his eyes brightening while says it again and again until Remus comes: fingers clutching his shoulders, a heel digging into the bed, Sirius\u2019 name on the bare thread of his breath as if it\u2019s the only thing that\u2019s ever mattered.</p>\n<p>All it takes to get him there is Remus\u2019 smile pressed to the hollow of his throat and his hands running up his biceps, and he comes, gasping into his hair, the slick rush burning high and melting wildly through his body; Remus holds onto him through the aftershocks, lips pressed to his neck, every inch of them entwined as inextricably and irrevocably as anything could ever be.</p>\n<p>Later, Remus\u2019 feet tucked under his leg and the quilt that smells like both of them pulled up around their chests, Sirius kisses his cheek, his temple, the scar on his chin, the place where his jaw meets his ear, feeling out the newest shape they\u2019ve shifted into, skin on skin and both of them wound around each other like a nautilus on the bed. \u201cYou know,\u201d he says, \u201cI am really glad you like shagging boys.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m really glad I do, too,\u201d says Remus, brushing his hair out of his eyes. Sirius loves to hear his voice like this, as if it begins in his body instead of his throat, speaking through his blood and bones and into him, moving him in a way only Remus can. \u201cI\u2019m really glad you got all your marbles in order.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMy marbles have a <em>thing</em> for you,\u201d he says, stretching. He always feels so open and raw and beautiful after, tangled with Remus in the middle of the night.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve been told,\u201d says Remus. There\u2019s such an off-kilter beauty to him, Sirius thinks, his big nose, his slight overbite, the blunt sweetness of his jaw. His eyes are brighter than anything has ever been, even in the December dark. \u201cIt makes me happy. You make me happy.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHow do you <em>do</em> that? Just\u2014I need to say something,\u201d he mutters, running a hand through his hair and holding Remus tighter, squeezing him around the ribs. \u201cYou\u2019re trying to outdo me because you\u2019re still hacked off about the socks, aren\u2019t you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh yes, exactly,\u201d Remus says dreamily, yawning as he settles himself against Sirius. \u201cIt couldn\u2019t have anything to do with you. Couldn\u2019t be that I need you here. Couldn\u2019t be that I don\u2019t ever want to wake up without you. Not at all.\u201d</p>\n<p>His heart constricts with Remus\u2019 voice, with all of it\u2014Remus hands and his hands, all the spaces they\u2019ve filled. \u201cMoony,\u201d he whispers, wonder clutching him by the throat, and closes his eyes.</p>\n<p>The splash of light in the room illuminates the shadows of their presence, colors painted like rippling ink: the desk, the books piled high, the extra blankets, the clothes strung out on the floor. Sometimes, he feels like these echoes, all the things he is and all the different boys he\u2019s been shimmering like torn silk, each one part of a whole he\u2019s only just beginning to see; he imagines what he\u2019ll look like in five years, what shape he and Remus will make on their bed, the man time will weave him. He imagines them like this room, like the scarves hung together on the back of the chair, the glass of water on the nightstand, the Muggle radio taken apart on his dresser. The ticking of a clock. Two hands, clasped together. A pack of cigarettes, half-empty. An open door.</p>\n<p>\u2014</p>\n<p>In the morning, in the kitchen, he finds Remus at the stove, a cup of tea on the counter and an oven mitt on one hand, shoving a turkey into the oven and looking mildly dubious about the whole thing, though Sirius can hardly blame him; last time they tried something like this, they forgot to take out the bag of gooey turkey-insides before they put it in the oven. It ended in severe nausea.</p>\n<p>\u201cHappy Christmas,\u201d Remus says when he sees him, smiling into his tea. \u201cWhere\u2019s my pony?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cRight here,\u201d says Sirius, draping his arms over his shoulders and kissing his nose, grinning wicked-sharp. \u201cWant to ride me?\u201d</p>\n<p>Remus, in spite of himself, laughs and drops his hands onto his chest, shaking his head fondly. \u201cThat\u2019s, well, it\u2019s not the <em>worst</em> thing you\u2019ve ever said,\u201d he says, \u201cbut it\u2019s right up there.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI can say worse.\u201d</p>\n<p>He smiles and smiles. \u201cI know.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnyway,\u201d says Sirius, stirring an obscene amount of cream into his own tea, bag still in, \u201chappy Christmas. I love you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Remus very carefully puts his tea back on the counter and turns to him, eyes shot wide, and says, \u201cSirius, did you just. I\u2014what. Did you say.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI said, happy Christmas. I love you.\u201d He takes a drink and takes Remus by the wrist, tugging him over and into him again. \u201cFigured that one out all on my own, too.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou love me,\u201d Remus whispers, swallowing hard, pulling back to look at him, as if Sirius is the only thing he can see. \u201cYou just said\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI know what I said,\u201d he says, tilting Remus head back up when he drops it. \u201cI love you. I want to get old and grey and arthritic with you. I want to get sick on pie with you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Something settles into Remus\u2019 skin, filling his scars, his eyes, his tired bones; Sirius has never actually seen him cry\u2014he\u2019s been close a few times\u2014but he thinks for a moment he might have done it, until Remus clenches his jaw and takes a deep breath, folding himself up against Sirius, who catches him\u2014just the same as he\u2019s always done.</p>\n<p>\u201cI got you <em>pyjamas</em>,\u201d he mumbles, slightly sniffly, into Sirius\u2019 shirt.</p>\n<p>He lets out a breath, bones gone unexpectedly to jelly. It fits his mouth so easily, like a charm, like the swift blossom of magic in his fingers, and he supposes that\u2019s what love is all about, anyway. It\u2019s insidious. It lurks, dark as burnt twilight, in the hollows of your own shadow and then springs on you, brilliant and transformative, while you\u2019re holding chocolate and pain potions in the pharmacy, when you\u2019ve found your body wrapped around someone else\u2019s, just for them and them alone.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s the bravest thing he\u2019s ever done, love.</p>\n<p>\u201cI love pyjamas,\u201d he whispers to Remus, shaky and exultant as he finds his lips. \u201cI\u2019ll never fucking take them off.\u201d</p>\n<p>In the white light of morning, both of them so raw and together and in love, Remus presses his face into Sirius\u2019 neck, right over his pulse. \u201cI love you,\u201d he says, right into his skin where Sirius can feel it, tangled in his blood.</p>\n<p>No matter where they go, he thinks, no matter how he grows or how he fits his pieces into place in the end, his compass will always point him here\u2014to the pulse in his ears, to the arms that hold him up. To all these places they keep themselves, and all the shapes they shift into, together.</p>"
