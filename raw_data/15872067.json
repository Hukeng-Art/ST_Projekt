  "text": "<p>\n<span>It\u2019s cold. He rubs his hands together, envies the couple at a table nearby with the hot coffees and a chocolate Lab at their feet. Rhodey has been waiting outside the caf\u00e9 for twenty minutes when Tony\u2019s silver Audi finally pulls up. He waves to the driver</span>\n<span>\u2014</span>\n<span>Tony in orange-tinted shades</span>\n<span>\u2014</span>\n<span>and is surprised when Tony doesn\u2019t switch off the engine and get out. Instead the passenger door window slides down.</span>\n<span></span>\n<br>\n<span></span>\n<br>\n<span>\u201cHey, To</span>\n<span>\u2014</span>\n<span>\u201d Rhodey begins to say, but he\u2019s cut off by a quiet hiss from Tony. Tony reaches across to push the door open. </span>\n<span></span>\n<br>\n<span></span>\n<br>\n<span>\u201cChange of plans,\u201d he says quietly</span>\n<span>\u2014</span>\n<span>so quietly Rhodey strains to hear him over the murmur of conversation from the caf\u00e9\u2019s patrons. \u201cGet in the car.\u201d</span>\n<span></span>\n<br>\n<span></span>\n<br>\n<span>Frowning, Rhodey does as he\u2019s told. His mind is jumping to all sorts of conclusions. Is there a fight? Against aliens or General Ross? Rhodey weighs up the pros and cons and hopes it\u2019s aliens.</span>\n<span></span>\n<br>\n<span></span>\n<br>\n<span>\u201cTony, what is going on?\u201d he asks, buckling his seat belt as Tony pushes the button to roll up the window. The warm air in the car is blissful after so long spent outside. He\u2019s aware that people are starting to stare at them, but he\u2019d assumed that in the privacy of the car he would be allowed to speak normally but Tony shushes him. \u201cWhat is going on?\u201d he repeats, lowering his volume. \u201cWe\u2019re supposed to meet for lunch and then you\u2019re twenty minutes late and acting weird and I\u2019m used to a lot of crap, man, but what is this? This is not your usual brand of weird.\u201d</span>\n<span></span>\n<br>\n<span></span>\n<br>\n<span>Tony pulls out into traffic</span>\n<span>\u2014</span>\n<span>Rhodey expects the roar of a powerful engine thanks to Tony\u2019s heavy right foot</span>\n<span>\u2014</span>\n<span>but no, he drives slow and steady like a grandma. \u201cDude,\u201d is all Rhodey has to say about that. </span>\n<span></span>\n<br>\n<span></span>\n<br>\n<span>\u201cSomething came up,\u201d Tony says softly. \u201cI had to make a detour on my way to our lunch meeting. I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re gonna miss those bacon sandwiches you like but\u2026\u201d Tony trails off and jerks his thumb, indicating the back seat.</span>\n<span></span>\n<br>\n<span></span>\n<br>\n<span>Rhodey twists around and jumps. \u201cHoly shit,\u201d he says, just shy of shouting it.</span>\n<span></span>\n<br>\n<span></span>\n<br>\n<span>It\u2019s that intern of Tony\u2019s</span>\n<span>\u2014</span>\n<span>Peter Parker if Rhodey\u2019s memory serves. He\u2019s fast asleep in the back seat, wrapped up in a blanket like a burrito with only his head visible. There\u2019s a sickly hue to his skin. The blanket has some sort of pattern on it and it takes Rhodey a moment too long to see what it is; a cartoon of Thor and lightning trails repeated over and over. The intern\u2019s breathing through his mouth, a damp patch of drool darkening the fabric of the blanket next to his chin.</span>\n<span></span>\n<br>\n<span></span>\n<br>\n<span>\u201cTony, what the hell? Why is your sick intern in your car?\u201d</span>\n<span></span>\n<br>\n<span>\n<br>\n</span>\n<span>\u201cHis school called his aunt who\u2019s busy at work so she called me. Nobody\u2019s home at their apartment so I\u2019m gonna take care of him at the compound until he\u2019s feeling better. It\u2019s a chain of responsibility thing we\u2019ve got going.\u201d He says this like it\u2019s normal for someone to be this involved in their intern\u2019s life. He glances in the rear view mirror and a worried frown appears on his face. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cSo you\u2019re, what, his dad for the day?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>Tony scoffs. \u201cPlease, you know I\u2019m not cut out to be anyone\u2019s dad,\u201d he says, adjusting the car\u2019s air conditioning between sixty-eight and sixty-nine degrees. He hums to himself, dissatisfied, twists the dial again. Seventy degrees. He glances in the rear view mirror at the intern, asks Rhodey, \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d</p>\n<p>\n<span>Rhodey just raises an eyebrow</span>\n<span>\u2014</span>\n<span>his patented </span>\n<em>\n<span>Tony, you\u2019re being ridiculous</span>\n</em>\n<span> look (he\u2019s had <em>a lot</em> of practise with it over the years). Tony rolls his eyes and sets the air conditioning at sixty-nine. They drive in companionable silence for a few minutes, then Tony shifts and sets the air conditioning to seventy. Ten minutes pass, then; \u201cMaybe that\u2019s too warm,\u201d Tony mutters to himself and sets it to sixty-eight.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cJesus, Tony!\u201d Rhodey says, too loud. There\u2019s a snort and a sniff from the back seat. Rhodey looks over his shoulder and sure enough Peter the intern is blinking sleepily back at him. When he looks to Tony he\u2019s glaring at him, but Rhodey just shrugs his shoulders and puts on his best </span>\n<em>\n<span>I\u2019m innocent</span>\n</em>\n<span> face.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHey, buddy, how are you doing?\u201d Tony asks, watching Peter in the rear view. As soon as he lays eyes on the kid the glare melts away to be replaced with a gently worried expression. He gets this soft, mushy look in his eyes, and his crow\u2019s feet deepen as he smiles gently. Rhodey has never seen that look on his face, but he decides that it\u2019s a good look on him. Clearly this kid means a lot to Tony. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI\u2019m fine, Mister Stark,\u201d the kid obviously lies</span>\n<span>\u2014</span>\n<span>or tries to lie</span>\n<span>\u2014</span>\n<span>he starts coughing and spluttering halfway through.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Tony reaches into the glove compartment and pulls out a juice box and a candy bar. Tony is watching the road but Rhodey is watching Tony</span>\n<span>\u2014</span>\n<span>that glove compartment is ridiculously well stocked; juice boxes, water bottles, candy bars, animal crackers, protein bars and a Spongebob-themed first aid kit.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Tony holds the juice box and candy bar up between the seats within the kid\u2019s reach. With some difficulty Peter extracts first one arm and then the other from under the blanket</span>\n<span>\u2014</span>\n<span>Tony must have had him wrapped up real tight</span>\n<span>\u2014</span>\n<span>and takes the offered items. He goes to eat the candy bar but Tony hears the wrapper rustle and pipes up, \u201cJuice first,\u201d and the kid rolls his eyes a little but he drinks, slurping the juice through the straw.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Tony gives Rhodey the side eye as he reaches for the glove compartment and pulls out a juice box and bag of animal crackers for himself. He looks Tony in the eye, daring him to say anything. \u201c</span>\n<em>\n<span>Tropical Thunder</span>\n</em>\n<span>, really?\u201d He turns the juice box in his hand so the front (and the cartoon of Thor with luxurious, long, yellow hair and a garish Hawaiian shirt) is facing Tony.</span>\n</p>\n<p>Tony shrugs. \u201cWhat can I say? The kid\u2019s a big fan.\u201d</p>\n<p><span>\u201c</span><em><span>Mister</span></em> <em><span>Stark</span></em><span>,\u201d Peter whines, half mumbling, his cheeks going red. Tony grins. \u201cDon\u2019t embarrass me in front of War Machine, oh my god.\u201d</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>Rhodey chuckles and is about to bite into an animal cracker when Tony says to him, \u201cJuice first.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Rhodey laughs and eats his cracker anyway because he\u2019s a rebel. He shakes his head. \u201cNot cut out to be a dad </span>\n<em>\n<span>my ass</span>\n</em>\n<span>.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>Rhodey doesn\u2019t register the car rolling to a stop, wrapped up as he is in his own misery, so all the warning he gets is the chipper, \u201cMorning, Mister Stark!\u201d from just outside the door before it\u2019s flung open and in scrambles Peter Parker, Tony\u2019s annoyingly young and healthy intern.</p>\n<p>\u201cMorning, kid,\u201d Tony replies immediately, and warmth softens his voice. Rhodey doesn\u2019t have to look to know that there\u2019s a dumb smile on his face.</p>\n<p>\u201cMorning, Mister Rhodey!\u201d</p>\n<p>Rhodey just grunts, his throat too sore for the speaking thing right now. He digs in his coat pocket for a throat lozenge, and it brings him sweet, honey-flavoured relief. While rummaging for his box of lozenges, Rhodey had expected Tony to drive off, but he hasn\u2019t \u2014 in the back seat, Peter has stilled. Rhodey looks up and finds Tony staring at him too \u2014 both of them have identical expressions of concern on their faces.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m fine, guys,\u201d Rhodey says, like it\u2019s an inconvenience that they even have to <em> think </em> about asking \u2014 but his voice is raspy, and damn, talking <em> hurts </em>. He winces, sucks on his lozenge.</p>\n<p>They\u2019re both squinting at him now, heads slightly tilted, mirrors of each other \u2014 <em> like they\u2019re father and son </em>, Rhodey\u2019s addled mind supplies. The car hasn\u2019t moved since Peter got in and Rhodey decides to focus on that instead, just to make them stop looking at him like that.</p>\n<p>\u201cAren\u2019t we supposed to, I don\u2019t know, be <em> going somewhere? </em>\u201d He gets the sentence out, but it costs him \u2014 he swirls the lozenge on his tongue, holds back the sigh of relief so Tony and his kid don\u2019t have any more ammo against him.</p>\n<p>Tony and <em> his kid? </em> Jesus.</p>\n<p>\u201cSeatbelt,\u201d Tony says, flat.</p>\n<p>\u201cHuh?\u201d says Peter.</p>\n<p>\u201cSeatbelt,\u201d Tony repeats in the same tone.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh! Sorry.\u201d</p>\n<p>Tony waits until there\u2019s an audible click from the back seat before they set off into the morning rush hour traffic. Going is slow, and Rhodey takes the opportunity to close his eyes. He\u2019s just resting them \u2014 he\u2019s <em> not </em> sleeping \u2014 but Tony and Peter seem to think he is.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s the sound of rustling fabric, then Peter tapping Tony\u2019s shoulder. \u201cMister Stark?\u201d Peter asks, keeping his voice low.</p>\n<p>Tony\u2019s reply is delayed \u2014 no doubt he looks over to check that Rhodey is asleep before he says anything. \u201cYeah?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat happened to Mister Rhodey? Is he okay?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAh,\u201d Tony says, hushed. \u201cRemember last week, when I had to pick you up from school cos you were sick? Yeah. Well I kinda left Rhodey standing in the cold for too long and you\u2019re a millennial, so you won\u2019t understand, but he\u2019s really old and delicate and he\u2019s, well, he\u2019s got distemper.\u201d</p>\n<p>Rhodey drops the pretense, splutters, \u201cI <em> do not! </em>\u201d</p>\n<p>Tony clicks his tongue, looks too damn smug. \u201cI knew it. I knew you weren\u2019t asleep.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI hate you,\u201d he mutters with no real heat, rubbing his throat \u2014 the honey lozenge a beautiful, distant memory. Rhodey can hear giggling coming from the back seat. He\u2019s too tired and stiff to turn around. \u201cHey, kid?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cShut up.\u201d</p>\n<p>The sniggering dies down, then, a few minutes later, because peace and quiet is too much to ask \u2014 \u201cWhat are you doing today, Mister Stark?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cRhodey and I have a big, big day today, don\u2019t we, buddy?\u201d Tony says, patting Rhodey\u2019s knee. Rhodey squints at him. \u201cI made these bad boys \u2014\u201d Tony taps one of Rhodey\u2019s leg braces with his finger, \u201cand thought hey, we could help people with these \u2014 wounded soldiers for a start, but one day hospitals too, so anyone who needed them could have access to a set. We\u2019ve got a trunk full of prototype exoskeletons to show to some big cheeses in the government \u2014 I kind of fell out with a lot of them circa 2008, but I was hoping that my living demonstration would help me out, but he\u2019s a bit of a zombie today, so I think I\u2019ll leave him in the car.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLike <em> hell </em>,\u201d Rhodey croaks.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll leave the window rolled down a crack.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m comin\u2019 in. This is <em> important </em>, Tony,\u201d Rhodey insists, and his tone is serious \u2014 he owes this to his colleagues, to every man or woman who chooses to wear the uniform and give their all in defense of their country. \u201cI\u2019m comin\u2019.\u201d</p>\n<p>Tony nods, understanding.</p>\n<p>Peter and Tony start chattering and Rhodey tunes them out, and he\u2019s not one hundred percent sure he doesn\u2019t doze off, because the next thing he knows is that they\u2019re stopping at a temporary red light \u2014 they\u2019re laying new gas pipes under the road.</p>\n<p>\u201cRoad work ahead?\u201d Peter pipes up, oddly expectant.</p>\n<p>Rhodey\u2019s about to reply and point out the obvious \u2014 <em> Yeah, they\u2019re laying pipes </em> \u2014 when Tony says dramatically, \u201cI sure hope it does.\u201d</p>\n<p>Rhodey\u2019s confused, but Peter bursts out laughing. Tony looks in the rear view mirror and only when he sees Peter\u2019s reaction and how happy he is does he chuckle too.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat the hell?\u201d Rhodey breathes, mostly to himself, but Tony hears him.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s a Vine,\u201d Tony \u2018explains\u2019 with a shrug, like this clears everything up and Rhodey should be impressed. \u201cI speak Millennial.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t,\u201d he says simply.</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI'm not a Millennial, Mister Stark. I'm Gen Z.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cGesundheit.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\u201cI send him Vines sometimes,\u201d Peter tries, and nope, Rhodey still doesn\u2019t have a clue what they\u2019re talking about. \u201cI could send you some if you\u2019d like.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUm, Rhodey only has a landline, he doesn\u2019t understand cell phones...\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo thanks,\u201d Rhodey says, addressing Peter and ignoring Tony. \u201cYou two keep talking about Tarzan or whatever, some of us need a drink.\u201d</p>\n<p>They pull up outside Peter\u2019s school ten minutes later, just as Rhodey is finishing his <em> Tropical Thunder </em> juice box. Peter unhooks his seatbelt, hand on the door handle, when Tony says, \u201cWait!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cJuice.\u201d Tony casually throws a juice box over his shoulder \u2014 Peter catches it surprisingly easily. \u201cProtein.\u201d A protein bar goes flying, gets caught one-handed. \u201cAnimals.\u201d Peter notices Rhodey watching, fumbles the catch this time, but Rhodey isn\u2019t fooled \u2014 there\u2019s <em> something </em>about this kid... \u201cMy love and support,\u201d Tony finishes, and mimes throwing something over his shoulder.</p>\n<p>Peter pretends to catch something, smiles and holds it close to his chest. \u201cGot it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGood kid,\u201d Tony says fondly as Peter climbs out of the car. \u201cHave a nice day!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou too, Mister Stark!\u201d he shouts, half walking backwards as he waves at them. \u201cBye, Mister Rhodey! G.W.S.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt means \u2018get well soon\u2019,\u201d Tony translates with a fond smile on his face, watching as Peter walks into the school with another kid, already talking animatedly to each other.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou two are real sweet,\u201d Rhodey deadpans. \u201cI\u2019m gonna need a new dental plan.\u201d</p>\n<p>\n<span>Rhodey remembers when they were both at MIT, when he and Tony would go out for breakfast to a nice local caf\u00e9, both nursing hangovers. Then later, when Tony was nursing a hangover and Rhodey was pissed so he\u2019d order the biggest, greasiest fried breakfast on the menu. Later still, when Rhodey was about to ship out on a tour \u2014 the fact that he may not come back heavy between them. After Tony had spent three months in a cave, after Tony was Iron Man and Rhodey was War Machine, after Tony\u2019s surgery, after Rhodey fell from the sky, always after, because the morning always comes and you\u2019ve gotta dust yourself off and get back in the game.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>They\u2019re going out for breakfast today \u2014 it\u2019s a normal thing,\u00a0like a tradition, something they\u2019ve determinedly continued to do even as the other aspects of their lives have gotten increasingly bizarre. Gods, aliens \u2014 and now, Tony being a soccer mom.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Tony\u2019s Audi pulls up next to the kerb and Rhodey gets in \u2014 he\u2019s not as graceful as he used to be, not with these leg braces. Peter\u2019s in the back seat already.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHey, kid,\u201d Rhodey says as he fastens his seatbelt.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cMorning, Mister Rhodey!\u201d Peter\u2019s always so chipper in the mornings. He\u2019s already got a </span>\n<em>\n<span>Tropical Thunder</span>\n</em>\n<span> juice box in his hand so maybe it\u2019s the sugar making him bounce.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHow\u2019d you get on with your algebra test?\u201d Rhodey asks conversationally.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHello, Tony, how are you today, I\u2019m fine, thank you,\u201d Tony mutters to himself, pulling out into traffic.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Rhodey grins and ignores him.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou remembered?\u201d Peter sounds surprised \u2014 Rhodey hears him breathe out a little, \u201cWow.\u201d Rhodey can understand why Tony\u00a0likes this kid so much. Peter clears his throat, says a bit louder, like it\u2019s nothing important, \u201cI, uh, I got an A.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Rhodey chuckles. \u201cNice one, Pete,\u201d he says, and he has no trouble imagining Peter shrinking at the praise. He holds his fist up between the front seats. Hesitantly, Peter bumps it.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThanks, Mister Rhodey,\u201d Peter says, and there\u2019s a pleased note in his voice.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Rhodey nods to himself, satisfied with a job well done. Encourage the youth, check.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI passed my algebra too,\u201d Tony pipes up petulantly, holding his fist up in Rhodey\u2019s face.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Rhodey rolls his eyes. \u201cYeah, thirty years ago. I ain\u2019t fist-bumping you for that.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Tony reels back, mock offended. He puts his previously fisted hand to his chest. \u201cI\u2019m hurt,\u201d he says, lifting his chin up haughtily.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Rhodey just gives him a look and when Tony glances over a moment later, his chin still held high, he bursts out laughing. Peter giggles too and the mirth in the atmosphere is so infectious, Rhodey joins in \u2014 and then they\u2019re all laughing, Tony wiping tears from his eyes as he tries to concentrate on where he\u2019s going.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Rhodey doesn\u2019t notice that Peter isn\u2019t laughing anymore until he hears an exclamation from the back seat; \u201cOh my god, Tony, look!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Tony\u2019s already looking in the rear view mirror, laughter forgotten at the urgency in Peter\u2019s voice. Rhodey twists around to see Peter \u2014 the kid\u2019s pointing at the sidewalk and Rhodey follows his finger. All he sees is a row of parked cars between the Audi and the sidewalk, then he registers someone running \u2014 running fast, weaving between startled pedestrians, wearing dark clothes. A masked man. He\u2019s got something orange in his hand.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cTony!\u201d Rhodey shouts and Tony\u2019s attention snaps back to the road and he slams his foot on the brake pedal \u2014 Tony was so busy watching the man that he almost didn\u2019t stop for the red light.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Rhodey exhales at the close call as a crowd of people start crossing the road in front of them.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI\u2019ve gotta go!\u201d Peter announces, opening the back door and jumping out, taking off after the man at a sprint.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cPete, wait!\u201d Tony yells but it\u2019s too late \u2014 the back door slams and Peter\u2019s gone. Tony turns to Rhodey. \u201cGo after him.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Rhodey blinks. \u201cWhat?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHe\u2019s just a \u2014 he\u2019s just a kid. I\u2019ll park the car and come find you,\u201d Tony says, talking fast. \u201cRhodey, </span>\n<em>\n<span>please</span>\n</em>\n<span>.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>It\u2019s not the car horns honking at them to </span>\n<em>\n<span>move already, the light\u2019s green</span>\n</em>\n<span> \u2014 it\u2019s the look of genuine fear in Tony\u2019s eyes, the helpless little please, that has Rhodey saying, \u201cOkay.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Tony nods imperceptibly, lets out a shaky breath. Rhodey loves the Tony he sees when the kid\u2019s with him, the affect the kid has had on his friend, the tenderness, the care, the damn Peter Kit in the glove box \u2014 but this? He </span>\n<em>\n<span>hates</span>\n</em>\n<span> this.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Mindful of oncoming traffic, he cautiously opens the door and gets out, crosses around the front of the Audi to a chorus of car horns and angry shouting from the drivers behind Tony. He ignores it all. Once Rhodey\u2019s clear, Tony guns it.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Rhodey may not be able to run with these leg braces but he can move pretty fast, yet he still feels like he\u2019s taking too long. Tony\u2019s fear seems to be as contagious as his laughter had been just minutes before \u2014 Rhodey\u2019s heart races, spurs him on. He knows which way Peter and the masked man went so he just keeps going as fast as he can. Some people have stopped to talk amongst themselves. \u201cDid you see that boy chasing that thief?\u201d they say, and it reassures Rhodey that he is going in the right direction.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Rhodey\u2019s panting from effort when he hears shouting coming from a nearby alley and peers into it, fists up and ready for a fight \u2014 there\u2019s a dumpster with a bag of trash next to it. A spooked cat runs past his feet. At the far end the masked man is lying on his stomach, breathing heavily, some sort of spider\u2019s web extending out from between his shoulder blades to the ground, pinning him down. He\u2019s squirming, cursing a blue streak \u2014 the web thing creaks wetly but holds firm.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Peter emerges from behind the dumpster with an orange purse in his hand and something balled up and red in the other, his hair in disarray. Rhodey breathes out a sigh of relief, his breathing coming back under control, and notes with mild annoyance that Peter isn\u2019t even breathless from his high-speed chase.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Peter startles when he spots Rhodey. \u201cMist \u2014 Mister Rhodey!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Rhodey crosses his arms. \u201cPeter,\u201d he says coolly, and even though he has no idea what happened here he is about to give one hell of a lecture to this kid for scaring Tony (and him, yeah, he\u2019ll admit it) like that.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Rhodey opens his mouth to begin when Peter suddenly points at something on the roof above Rhodey\u2019s head and shouts, \u201cLook! It\u2019s Spider-Man!\u201d\u00a0</span>\n<span>Rhodey twists to see, but by the time he does there\u2019s nothing there.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>He turns back in time to see Peter stuffing the balled up piece of red fabric into his pocket.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Rhodey\u2019s not impressed. \u201cWhat was that?\u201d he asks.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhat was what?\u201d Peter asks in return, all innocent, but his voice cracks slightly on the final word.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Rhodey points in the vague direction of Peter\u2019s pocket. \u201cThat red thing you just shoved in your pocket behind my back.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Peter pats the tell-tale bulge in his hoodie. \u201cOh, this? This is \u2014 this is a beanie.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Rhodey\u2019s tone is flat. \u201cA beanie?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYeah, a beanie. My \u2014 my ears, they, uh, get cold when I run.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Peter seems to hear something, and then Rhodey hears it too \u2014 Tony calling their names.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOver here!\u201d Rhodey shouts, his eyes narrowed at Peter, the message clear: </span>\n<em>\n<span>this isn\u2019t over</span>\n</em>\n<span>. Peter gulps, and Rhodey doesn\u2019t fail to notice that the kid sags in relief when Tony arrives. Tony\u2019s on the cusp of hyperventilating.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cPete?\u201d he breathes, then he sees Peter and his shoulders relax. \u201cOh, thank god.\u201d He puts one hand on Rhodey\u2019s shoulder and bends over, catching his breath.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Peter waits, still holding the orange purse, wringing his hands nervously. The masked man has gone quiet, presumably resigned to his capture. Tony straightens but keeps his hand on Rhodey\u2019s shoulder, squeezing a gentle </span>\n<em>\n<span>thank you</span>\n</em>\n<span>. \u201cDon\u2019t </span>\n<em>\n<span>ever</span>\n</em>\n<span> do that to me again, Pete, I\u2019m serious. I have a heart condition.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Peter nods, looking guilty. Rhodey\u2019s surprised when Tony doesn\u2019t ask him to promise and Peter doesn\u2019t offer to.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Tony releases Rhodey\u2019s shoulder, stepping forward, eyes raking over Peter. \u201cNow, down to business \u2014 you okay?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI\u2019m fine, Mister Stark, he didn\u2019t touch me. Spider-Man got him before I could.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOh, is that so?\u201d Tony says and there\u2019s something in his tone that Rhodey can\u2019t decipher. \u201cIt\u2019s lucky he was here, then.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Tony closes the distance between them, wraps his arms around Peter and he responds immediately, the orange purse bumping on Tony\u2019s back as he\u00a0throws\u00a0his arms around Tony\u2019s waist. Tony whispers something into the kid\u2019s ear that his him nodding solemnly, and then something that makes him smile. Rhodey looks away, giving them some semblance of privacy.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d Tony says lightly, and walks past Rhodey with the kid under his arm \u2014 likely more for his own comfort than for Peter\u2019s. Rhodey looks over at the masked man \u2014 the orange purse is sitting on his back, rising up and down rhythmically with each breath.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cBut what about \u2014?\u201d Rhodey starts to ask, but Tony waves vaguely.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIt\u2019s taken care of. I called 911.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Sure enough Rhodey can hear sirens approaching.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAlright, fine, but for breakfast I\u2019m ordering something big and greasy.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Tony chuckles, nods at him over Peter\u2019s head\u00a0\u2014 message received.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Rhodey sits on a bench, his back to a park, and thinks that it\u2019s a beautiful morning to be alive. The sun is rising, streaks of golden light slipping between the buildings. He\u2019s watching the pigeons on the sidewalk as they waddle along, heads bobbing in time to their steps. He can hear runners and dog-walkers as they pass by behind him.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>One of the pigeons, a mottled brown one, comes over to peck at Rhodey\u2019s sneakers. He waggles his foot and still it persists. \u201cShoo,\u201d he hisses, waving his arms at it. It flaps its wings and jumps back a few inches, but a moment later it\u2019s pecking him again. Rhodey\u2019s lips form a half-smile and he points at the persistent bird. \u201cI\u2019m calling you Tony.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Real Tony\u2019s late this morning \u2014 it\u2019s something Rhodey got used to a long time ago, and on a morning like this Rhodey wouldn\u2019t mind too much, yet he finds that he doesn\u2019t want Peter to be late for school. He\u2019s not even that close to the kid, but he does care. He\u2019s got this innocence to him, it\u2019s bringing out Rhodey\u2019s fatherly instincts. He\u2019s just too damned likeable and Rhodey must be going soft in his old age because he points at another pigeon, standing a little ways away from Pigeon Tony, smaller and with a few feathers out of place, and announces to it, \u201cYou\u2019re Peter.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Pigeon Tony and Pigeon Peter keep Rhodey entertained for several more minutes before a familiar car shows up \u2014 not the orange Audi Rhodey was expecting, but Happy\u2019s sleek black sedan. Rhodey gets up from his bench and his new friends quickly step away. He waves a fleeting goodbye to them before carefully crossing the street to Happy\u2019s car.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The passenger side window rolls down, Rhodey\u2019s reflection on the glass sliding from view to reveal Tony. He looks tired, nursing a takeaway coffee. \u201cSorry, Rhodey, it\u2019s the booster seat in the back for you today,\u201d he says, not really sounding sorry.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHilarious,\u201d Rhodey replies flatly, opening the back door \u2014 to his surprise, that seat\u2019s taken too.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>There\u2019s a strange kid in the back seat, holding animal crackers and a juice box, staring up at Rhodey with wide eyes and a slack jaw \u2014 either Peter has gained a few pounds and changed race, or this isn\u2019t him. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>At the sight of Rhodey the kid freezes mid-munch, squeezes the juice box until a drop of yellow liquid escapes from the top of the straw. \u201cOh my god,\u201d he breathes.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHi,\u201d Rhodey says.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHi,\u201d the kid replies with a nervous giggle, still blatantly staring.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNed,\u201d Peter grumbles, unseen from where Rhodey\u2019s standing. A hand appears and starts tugging on Ned\u2019s arm. \u201cCome on, Ned, move over to let Mister Rhodey in.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Ned visibly shakes himself, stutters, \u201cOh, right yeah, sorry, War Patriot \u2014 Iron Machine \u2014 erm, I mean, Colonel Rhodes.\u201d Rhodey waits patiently as Ned collects his backpack from the middle seat and slides over to sit there himself. Rhodey gets in, taking up the vacated seat, and leans forward so he\u2019s saying into Tony\u2019s ear, \u201cDude, where are you getting all these kids from?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cBuckle up,\u201d Happy announces before Tony can reply, and unlike Tony he doesn\u2019t wait until seat belts are actually on before he sets the car into motion. Rhodey slides back on the leather until the back of the seat stops him.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou\u2019re usually more polite than this,\u201d Rhodey points out, belatedly clicking his seat belt into place.</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>Happy grunts, a distinctly not</span> <span>happy sound \u2014 it\u2019s probably something to do with the digital clock on the dash that reads 7:51 AM. \u201cYeah? Well you try wrangling two actual kids and a grown-up kid at six in the morning, see how it leaves you.\u201d</span></p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHey!\u201d Tony protests, but it\u2019s half-hearted.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWe had a sleepover at the Compound,\u201d Ned speaks up, as if this explains why everyone is so tightly wound this morning. \u201cWe had to get on the road early cos the Compound is so far away, you know? Who am I kidding, of course you know! You\u2019re War Machine! You\u2019re such a badass if I may say so, your highness \u2014 er, I mean \u2014 sir.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Rhodey\u2019s brain scrambles to catch up with the barrage of words. \u201cOkay, but who are you?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>The bluntness doesn\u2019t phase Ned. \u201cOh! Sorry. I\u2019m Ned, Peter\u2019s friend,\u201d he says, holding out a hand for Rhodey to shake.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cNice to meet you, Ned,\u201d Rhodey replies, taking Ned\u2019s hand and giving it a firm shake \u2014 Ned tries to act cool but he starts to breathe a little too fast. \u201cYou been to the Compound before?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Ned shakes his head. \u201cNo, it was my first time. It\u2019s so awesome there! Mister Stark has all the best tech, it\u2019s incredible! We watched movies, had pizza, played \u2014 experimented, I mean, cos we\u2019re not kids who play with things, duh \u2014 in the lab, and then we studied for our geography tests today, didn\u2019t we, Pete?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYeah,\u201d Peter replies, carefully munching on a protein bar Rhodey recognises as one from Tony\u2019s stash.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>For the first time since he got into the car, Rhodey takes a proper look at Peter. He hasn\u2019t seen Peter since he ran off in pursuit of a petty criminal in broad daylight and then had the audacity to lie to Rhodey\u2019s face. He\u2019s biting his lip, nervous \u2014 he\u2019s trapped, squished in between the car door and Ned. The bags under his eyes match Ned\u2019s and Tony\u2019s \u2014 Tony is practically radiating exhaustion, but then he\u2019s not as young as he used to be.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cTony study with you guys too?\u201d Rhodey asks, his mind already painting a picture for him.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI know more about drainage basins now than I ever wanted to,\u201d Tony says, sipping his coffee.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cReally?\u201d Rhodey asks, hardly believing that this is what has become of his often irresponsible, erratic friend \u2014 staying up most of the night with two kids to help them study for a geography test. He shakes his head. \u201cNah, I don\u2019t buy it.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Hearing that as a challenge, Peter sits up and leans forward in his seat. \u201cHey, Mister Stark, what\u2019s a confluence?\u201d he asks.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhere two rivers or streams meet,\u201d Tony answers easily.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cA kettlehole?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThat\u2019s a hollow caused by glaciers melting.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cSon of a bitch,\u201d Rhodey mutters, impressed.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cI\u2019ve got one. What\u2019s a blowout depression?\u201d Ned prompts.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHow I spent the nineties,\u201d Tony replies lightly. Happy snorts.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>After Tony\u2019s attempt at humour there\u2019s a lull in the conversation. Happy expertly navigates them through traffic. Peter and Rhodey take turns getting squished against the doors as Happy rounds corners a bit too fast and the car leans.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>It\u2019s on a corner \u2014 with the car leaning into a turn and Peter getting squished, Rhodey pressed against Ned \u2014 that Rhodey notices something dangling from the zipper on Ned\u2019s backpack. He reaches out with his hand to steady it as it sways with the car\u2019s movement. It\u2019s a blue and red disc with a spider web pattern overlaid, and two white shapes that resemble Spider-Man\u2019s eyes.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou like Spider-Man, Ned?\u201d Rhodey asks, carefully casual.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Ned looks down at his keyring, glances for a split second at Peter. \u201cOh yeah! He\u2019s so badass.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cDid you see that robbery he stopped last week? That was some serious firepower he was up against but he made it out without a scratch. Amazing.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>As he talks Rhodey is watching Peter\u2019s reactions. He subconsciously rubs at his arm, eyes far away as he looks out the window. He has his hand on the handle above his head, but his grip slips \u2014 sweaty palms equal anxiety. </span>\n<em>\n<span>Gotcha</span>\n</em>\n<span>, Rhodey thinks.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHey, Peter, you okay over there?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Tony isn\u2019t hiding the fact that he\u2019s listening in. He twists his head to check on Peter at Rhodey's words. \u201cYou alright back there, bud?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Peter's attention snaps back to the people inside the car \u2014 he looks at Tony first, then Ned and Rhodey, avoiding Rhodey\u2019s eyes. \u201cHuh? I'm fine,\u201d he says, and the response is automatic. He clears his throat, goes on, \u201cI\u2019m just \u2014 just nervous about the geography test today. It\u2019s quite important. It means a lot to our final grade.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cRight,\u201d says Rhodey. \u201cWe were just talking about Spider-Man. Do you like him?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Peter stammers. \u201cHe\u2019s \u2014 he\u2019s okay, I guess.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cOkay? He\u2019s the best!\u201d Ned says with absolute conviction and Peter ducks his head, a slight hint of rose to his cheeks. Then Ned blinks and seems to remember his present company. \u201cExcept for War Machine and Iron Man of course,\u201d he tacks on, finishing with a lame chuckle. </span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cBut you know who Iron Man and War Machine are \u2014 they\u2019re people,\u201d Rhodey presses, trying not to grin at Peter\u2019s reaction. \u201cBut what if Spider-Man\u2019s an alien? There\u2019s no way an ordinary person could climb buildings like that. He must have tentacles with suckers under that suit \u2014 if it even </span>\n<em>\n<span>is</span>\n</em>\n<span> a suit.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cEw, that\u2019s gross,\u201d Ned says.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYou got something against tentacles, Ned?\u201d Rhodey challenges with a raised eyebrow.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Before Rhodey can have any more fun, Happy pulls up at the school. According to the car\u2019s clock it\u2019s 8:13 AM \u2014 Happy made good time and Peter and Ned are only slightly late for school.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cGood luck with your test, kids,\u201d Tony says. Having already fed them this morning, Tony just \u2018tosses\u2019 his love and support over his shoulder for Peter to \u2018catch\u2019 \u2014 but Peter\u2019s distracted enough that he forgets to play along. Tony sighs. \u201cOkay, my love and support just hit you in the face, Pete.\u201d He twists around in his seat with a little grunt to look Peter in the eye. \u201cYou\u2019ll do great, okay. I </span>\n<em>\n<span>know</span>\n</em>\n<span> it.\u201d There\u2019s no hint of doubt in his tone and Peter nods.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThanks, Mister Stark,\u201d he says and musters up a little smile. Ned squeezes Peter\u2019s shoulder.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cHey, kids,\u201d Happy pipes up and everyone looks at him. \u201cStop giving each other mushy looks and get out of the car, you\u2019re late for school. Move it!\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cSorry, Happy,\u201d Peter says, gathering his backpack and opening the door.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cAnd you\u2019re going to ace your test, right?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cYes, Happy.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cGood kid, off you go.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Rhodey doesn\u2019t fail to notice the fondness in Happy\u2019s eyes as he looks in the rear view mirror at Peter. </span>\n<em>\n<span>You too, huh?</span>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThanks for the lift, Mister Happy,\u201d Ned adds and he scooches over to the door.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cGood luck with your test, too, Ned,\u201d Tony says. \u201cDon\u2019t meander.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cThanks, Mister Stark, I won\u2019t.\u201d With a final grin, Ned joins Peter and together they jog up the steps to the school door, disappearing inside.</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>As soon as they\u2019re gone, Tony asks, \u201cWhen did you work it out?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cWhat, the obvious fact that Peter is Spider-Man? Uh, almost as soon as he tried to lie about it. Frankly, I\u2019m insulted that you didn\u2019t just tell me. Pigeon Tony would have treated me with more respect.\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t my secret to tell \u2014 wait, what?\u201d</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n<span>Rhodey grins. \u201cMy physical therapist\u2019s office, please, Happy.\u201d</span>\n</p>"
