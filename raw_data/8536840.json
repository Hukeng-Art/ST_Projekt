  "text": "<p>1.</p>\n<p>During the mornings, Victor hugs like an octopus.</p>\n<p>Or like a big Russian parasite that has icy feet and leeches warmth off Yuuri.</p>\n<p><em>There\u2019s no better way to describe it</em>, Yuuri thinks with a defeated groan as he tries to rub away the remaining sleep in his eyes and simultaneously pry off the limbs clutching at his torso. It\u2019s way too early in the morning, the first rays of sun barely peeking on the horizon and there\u2019s an uncomfortable pressure in his bladder that\u2019s begging to be relieved.</p>\n<p>\u201cVictor,\u201d He croaks, voice still rough from having just woken up. Next to him, Victor is all but dead to the world, half his face buried on the pillow and half on the crook of Yuuri\u2019s neck. It\u2019s an adorably heartwarming sight as it always is every morning, with Victor\u2019s face peaceful and his silver hair mussed from moving around in his sleep but Yuuri really, <em>really </em>has to go to the bathroom. \u201cVictor, let go.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMm.\u201d Victor presses up even closer in response, refusing to open his eyes.</p>\n<p>\u201cVictor, come on.\u201d Yuuri makes a stronger attempt to free himself, and the older man scrunches up his face in displeasure. \u201cI have to pee.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cPee later,\u201d Victor mumbles. When barely awake, his accent makes itself known, thick and heavy. It takes Yuuri a full minute to decipher what he said (well, half a minute, to be honest; the other half is spent marveling at the low drop of Victor\u2019s voice) and then Victor is being pushed away again, Yuuri standing up before Victor\u2019s hands can haul him back to bed.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll be quick,\u201d Yuuri says and smiles when instead of answering, Victor grunts in annoyance, burying his face on the pillow Yuuri previously occupied.</p>\n<p>When Yuuri comes back from the bathroom, he slides back in under the covers and lets Victor\u2019s arms pull him close once more, smiling fondly as he hears Victor sigh in what sounds like contentment. However, as Victor\u2019s feet brush up against the back of his legs, the smile fades and Yuuri makes an undignified noise.</p>\n<p>\u201cVictor!\u201d</p>\n<p>Victor\u2019s laugh sounds too satisfied for someone supposedly asleep.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re terrible,\u201d Yuuri huffs out, trying to inch away from the clammy touch but Victor has latched onto him tightly with his limbs, caging him, and is grinning against the skin of Yuuri\u2019s neck. \u201cHonestly, why do you have cold feet? I\u2019m the one who got out of bed!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s a talent,\u201d Victor murmurs, brushing his lips on Yuuri\u2019s pulse as some sort of apology. \u201cIt helps me get revenge on those who leave me with no one to cuddle.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI was only gone for five minutes.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI suffered greatly for five minutes.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re such a drama queen,\u201d Yuuri says, turning to face him, and Victor laughs again, low and melodious in Yuuri\u2019s ears. He ignores the fluttering sensation in his chest at the sound, and instead buries a hand into Victor\u2019s soft hair, letting his fingers gently massage the scalp.</p>\n<p>Victor gives a sleepy hum of appreciation, nuzzling closer. His eyelashes are long and beautiful with his eyes closed, fanned out across his cheeks. There\u2019s the faintest smile playing on his lips, the soft kind that Yuuri only ever sees when they\u2019re alone together. Yuuri\u2019s heart skips a beat and he swallows back the lump in his throat. Victor is so unfairly breathtaking sometimes.</p>\n<p>\u201cGo back to sleep,\u201d He whispers, feeling ridiculously overcome with adoration, and plays with Victor\u2019s hair until his breath is even and deep. Victor\u2019s feet may be outrageously cold but his palms are warm splayed against Yuuri\u2019s back and Yuuri feels more loved than he\u2019s ever been inside Victor\u2019s embrace.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>2.</p>\n<p>In front of the Katsuki family, Victor is kind of shameless.</p>\n<p>Not shameless in an obscene way, no. <strike>Okay, sometimes in an obscene way, too</strike>. But definitely shameless, because he doesn\u2019t seem to care about whoever it is that\u2019s present around them, Victor will touch Yuuri <em>when</em> he wants to touch him and nothing short of Yuuri\u2019s \u201cno\u201d can stop him from doing so. And goodness knows Yuuri sucks at denying Victor anything.</p>\n<p>They\u2019re playing Jenga on one of the tables, Yuuri and his sister Mari, during a slow night at the onsen. It\u2019s late and most of the patrons have gone home, so it\u2019s quiet in the inn save for the two of them. Their father is still at the front desk, calculating the day\u2019s sales, and their mother is holed up at the kitchen, putting away the last of the washed dishes.</p>\n<p>\u201cDamn,\u201d Mari swears as she glares at the wooden tower, turning her head here and there as if it\u2019ll help her decide better which block she\u2019s supposed to move. She tugs at one of her earrings, a habit of frustration, and Yuuri grins. \u201cYou\u2019ve gotten way too good at this, Yuuri.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve learned some tricks while in college in Detroit,\u201d Yuuri admits as he watches his sister struggle to remove a block, the tower wobbling dangerously before staying put again. Mari heaves a loud sigh, placing the block on top.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhere\u2019d you learn the tricks from?\u201d</p>\n<p>Yuuri smiles, a little smug, and confidently pushes at one of the blocks in the middle. Mari tenses but the tower doesn\u2019t even budge as Yuuri removes the piece and stacks it next to Mari\u2019s previous block. \u201cFrom engineering majors.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGoddammit, that\u2019s so unfair.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yuuri laughs. \u201cIt\u2019s your turn, nee-chan.\u201d</p>\n<p>It\u2019s then that Victor rounds a corner and walks into the dining room, pausing for a second at the odd sight before breaking into a wide grin. \u201cJenga!\u201d He exclaims excitedly, dropping to a seat next to Yuuri and latching by his side. Yuuri almost smacks the tower down as he flails his hands to get his balance back. Victor\u2019s not light by any means.</p>\n<p>\u201cVictor,\u201d Yuuri says at the same time Mari collapses into laughter, \u201cbe careful.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, no, you should have tackled him harder,\u201d Mari argues, grinning at Victor. \u201cYou play Jenga?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI try,\u201d Victor admits sheepishly, hugging Yuuri close and resting his silver head on his shoulder. Yuuri blushes a little, sending Mari a self-conscious glance but his sister\u2019s focus is on Victor. It\u2019s still a little ridiculous, how unfazed Yuuri\u2019s family is with Victor and his antics, or with the fact that Yuuri is in a relationship with his childhood idol and coach. Yuuri muses he should just be grateful they\u2019re not weird about it. \u201cYurio says I\u2019m too excitable for the game.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, that cute boy,\u201d Mari sighs as Yuuri takes his turn again, \u201cHe should visit Japan again sometime. Tell him we miss him here.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll pass on the message,\u201d Victor says. His smile widens at the skillful way Yuuri removes a block, the motion of his hand smooth and steady as he places it on top of the tower. \u201cWow, I didn\u2019t know you\u2019re so good at Jenga, Yuuri!\u201d</p>\n<p>Yuuri preens at the praise.</p>\n<p>\u201cIf only you had the same confidence on ice!\u201d</p>\n<p>Aaaand, there it is. Of course Victor won\u2019t be able to pass up an opportunity to make a playful jab at him. Yuuri rolls his eyes with the tiniest of sighs, elbowing Victor gently. Victor\u2019s mock pout of sadness is cute but Yuuri\u2019s not about to tell him that.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s too good,\u201d Mari huffs out as she takes her turn, scowling as Yuuri shoots her a smile. When the stack shakes again, both she and Victor gasp in terror. \u201cVictor, help!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay!\u201d Victor\u2019s free hand reaches up in reflex but Yuuri pulls it back before it can support the wooden tower.</p>\n<p>\u201cCheating,\u201d Yuuri complains. He goes ignored as the tower stills, and both his sister and Victor let out twin breaths of relief.</p>\n<p>\u201cI think it\u2019s only fair,\u201d Mari shoots back. \u201cYou learned tricks from engineering people.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yuuri arches an eyebrow. \u201cThe rules don\u2019t say anything about that.\u201d Next to him, Victor lets out a thoughtful hum. The older man presses closer until he\u2019s practically glued to Yuuri\u2019s side, until soft hair strands are tickling the sensitive area of Yuuri\u2019s neck but Yuuri thinks none of it.</p>\n<p>Mari huffs again, but relents. \u201cFine.\u201d</p>\n<p>They continue the game with a few protests and curses from Mari every now and then and extreme concentration from Yuuri. As the minutes tick by, the pieces on the lower levels start missing, and the tower gets more unstable. Victor presses impossibly closer.</p>\n<p>The game is getting\u2026difficult.</p>\n<p>Not only because half of the pile is leaning sideways now like a small, wooden replica of the Tower of Pisa and Yuuri\u2019s choices are becoming limited, but also because there is a very attractive Russian man breathing softly against his ear, sending shivers down his spine, smooth lips brushing against Yuuri\u2019s cheek from time to time and clever fingers tracing patterns by his hips under the table and It. Is. Really. Distracting.</p>\n<p>\u201cVictor,\u201d Yuuri tuts under his breath, brows furrowing as he focused on taking out a piece. Victor kisses his cheek. \u201cStop it.\u201d Any other time, Yuuri might give in to Victor\u2019s touches gladly but this is Jenga. <em>Jenga. </em>Yuuri has spent countless embarrassing times losing against Engineering Majors just so he can beat Mari at this game when he came back home.</p>\n<p>Victor makes a questioning sound, somehow clueless of what he\u2019s doing to Yuuri, and then proceeds to nuzzle his face against Yuuri\u2019s throat.</p>\n<p>Yuuri tenses, and the tower wobbles for the first time during his turn.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, oh!\u201d Mari braces herself in excitement. \u201cIt\u2019s going to fall\u2014!\u201d</p>\n<p>It doesn\u2019t, and Yuuri lets loose the breath he\u2019s holding in.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo good,\u201d Victor murmurs in his ear, his embrace around Yuuri tightening for a moment, \u201cYou\u2019re so good, Yuuri.\u201d His voice is low, breathy, reminding Yuuri of their more thrilling nights spent together sharing a bed. Yuuri shudders.</p>\n<p>He flushes immediately, and scowls. \u201cVictor, I\u2019m trying to win here.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI know,\u201d Victor breathes out but squeezes Yuuri\u2019s thigh, smiling when Yuuri jumps a bit in his seat and lets out a startled protest. \u201cWin for me, okay?\u201d</p>\n<p>Yuuri looks at Mari again, feeling more than a little mortified at how Victor is blatantly flirting with him in front of his sister, but Mari can\u2019t be bothered, apparently. Her glare is on the Jenga tower and nothing else.</p>\n<p>She chooses a piece, takes it out carefully, and places it on top of the pile. The tower doesn\u2019t even move an inch. Mari smirks. \u201cYour turn, <em>otouto.</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>Yuuri purses his lips as he takes his turn, weighing his options carefully and studying the stack. There\u2019s a piece on the upper level that\u2019s in the middle, another piece by the bottom part that\u2019s already sticking out and is much easier to remove, but there\u2019s also a piece near the side that seems safe to take out and there\u2019s\u2014</p>\n<p>There\u2019s Victor\u2019s warm hand <em>sneaking up his shirt.</em></p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Victor</em>,\u201d Yuuri hisses, face burning, \u201cknock it off<em>.</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>He pinches the back of Victor\u2019s hand, heaving a sigh when the older man winces and takes it out. Yuuri ignores Victor\u2019s pouting in favor of choosing the block at the bottom, keeping his hand steady. He\u2019ll apologize to Victor later for the pinching but for now, Yuuri sticks out his tongue and concentrates, gently pulling the piece out of the pile.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s halfway through when the tower wobbles and Mari tenses up. Yuuri holds his breath, halting his movement. The pile becomes stable again.</p>\n<p>\u201cCome on, come on,\u201d Yuuri chants as resumes taking it out. It\u2019s so close, he\u2019s so close to removing it, slowly, <em>slowly</em>\u2014</p>\n<p>Victor bites his earlobe and Yuuri shrieks.</p>\n<p>His hand jerks violently, shocked, and through his askew glasses, Yuuri sees the tower collapse into a mess of wooden blocks, crashing noisily against the table. His mouth drops open in both surprise and disbelief as Mari bolts up from her seat and whoops loudly.</p>\n<p>Next to Yuuri, Victor is torn between chuckling and cooing sympathetically, pulling away from Yuuri to rub his back in consolation.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes!\u201d Mari throws her hands up in triumph, laughing. \u201cI guess I win. Better luck next time, <em>otouto.</em>\u201d Before she leaves Yuuri behind to stare at the Jenga pieces in utter defeat, Mari turns to look at Victor and smirks. She throws him an easy thumbs-up. \u201cGood job, lover boy.\u201d</p>\n<p>Victor grins at her and returns the gesture.</p>\n<p>Yuuri stares at them, incredulous.</p>\n<p>What.</p>\n<p>The.</p>\n<p>Hell.</p>\n<p>\u201cDid you just,\u201d Yuuri starts lowly, voice flat and eyes dead on Victor, \u201cplot against me? <em>With my sister?</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>Victor\u2019s blue eyes are wide as they turn to him, blinking innocently. Too innocently. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Victor asks, and then looks at the disaster of the Jenga tower and grins. He transfers to the other side of the table facing Yuuri. \u201cYuuri, play with me now!\u201d</p>\n<p>Yuuri closes his eyes, takes a calming deep breath, and plays with him.</p>\n<p>Later, if Victor\u2019s defeated wails sound like music to Yuuri\u2019s ears and Yuuri seems a little too delighted in seeing his boyfriend lose for the third time around, then no one can really blame him, can they?</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>3.</p>\n<p>In competitions, Victor\u2019s hugs are fierce and passionate.</p>\n<p>The lights are too bright, and the roar of the crowd, voices blending into and clashing terribly with one another, makes his ears ring. The chill of the ice seeps into his skin and settles deep within his bones as Yuuri clutches at the wall of the rink with a grip so tight, his knuckles are losing color.</p>\n<p><em>I can do this</em>, Yuuri tells himself. He takes a deep breath, releases it as a shuddering sigh. The current contestant attempts a triple Axel and lands badly, falling down on the rink. The audience\u2019s echoing dismay cuts sharper into Yuuri\u2019s heart than a skating blade cuts through ice.</p>\n<p><em>Right,</em> Yuuri thinks again, swallowing tightly. He feels cold, his fingertips are freezing, but his palms are sweating bullets and everything is awkwardly gross. <em>I was wrong, I can\u2019t do this.</em></p>\n<p>He knows it\u2019s just his anxiety talking. Of course, he knows.</p>\n<p>Yuuri also knows he\u2019s well-prepared for the competition despite his nerves, he and Victor literally practicing his program for hours on end until everything was smooth and perfectly in sync with the music, until his jumps were all beautifully landed. He hasn\u2019t gotten this far with just mere luck\u2014this was the result of months of rigorous training, effort and hard work.</p>\n<p>That\u2019s not to say Yuuri\u2019s lungs aren\u2019t starting to burn from the frigid air, his breath coming in short and stuttering. <em>Not now,</em> Yuuri begs himself, clenching his fists, <em>not now, please. </em>His confidence is a work in progress, his anxiety slowly getting better, but this must be a spectacularly bad day because all Yuuri wants to do is to curl up into a ball and breathe into a paper bag.</p>\n<p>\u201cYuuri~!\u201d</p>\n<p>All of a sudden, there\u2019s someone putting their arm around his shoulder, bumping against his side playfully. Yuuri makes a startled noise, wobbling on his skates, but Victor rights him before he can completely lose balance.</p>\n<p>\u201cVictor!\u201d Yuuri turns to him in protest. Victor\u2019s smile is bright and amused, and unconsciously, Yuuri lets out a shaky breath of relief despite the scare that just sent his heart racing. \u201cI almost fell!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d Victor says with a brilliant grin, \u201cI\u2019ll always be there to catch you when you fall, Yuuri.\u201d He adds in a wink, one that makes him look dangerously charming, and Yuuri rolls his eyes, pretending not to know about the heat growing on his cheeks.</p>\n<p>How Victor can keep saying those cheesy lines with such a straight face, Yuuri will never know.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou look ravishing in that outfit,\u201d Victor comments with a suggestively raised eyebrow. Yuuri pointedly ignores him. \u201cLook at you, you are so hot, you\u2019re sweating.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yuuri grits his teeth. He\u2019s all too aware that he\u2019s sweating through his thin costume. \u201cI\u2019m sweating because I\u2019m nervous, you prick.\u201d</p>\n<p>He flushes into a deep red as soon as he swears, mortified at his words. \u201cOh god, <em>no</em>,\u201d Yuuri groans out in embarrassment, burying his face into his sweaty palms. Next to him, Victor laughs in delight. \u201cIt just slipped out, I didn\u2019t mean\u2014Stop laughing, Victor, it\u2019s not funny.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMy, what a dirty mouth,\u201d Victor grins, patting Yuuri on the shoulder. His hand slides up, staying on the side of Yuuri\u2019s neck, and his thumb starts to rub soothing circles at the nape. The movement is delightful, and Yuuri can\u2019t help but close his eyes. He sucks in another deep breath, slowly sagging against Victor.</p>\n<p>\u201cYuuri,\u201d Victor whispers, saying his name with tenderness far deeper than a coach should have for a student and it\u2019s times like these that Yuuri appreciates the fact that both of them have always had a difficult time pretending they share nothing more than a professional relationship. He finds that he needs Victor\u2019s reassurance right now more than ever. \u201cBreathe with me, <em>solnyshko.</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>Yuuri obeys. He keeps his eyes closed and breathes in time with Victor\u2019s inhales and exhales, the thick cloud of doubt and fear in his mind fading little by little as Victor speaks low enough that only Yuuri can hear it, narrating the elements in his program.</p>\n<p>\u201cA quadruple Salchow in the second part of the program, followed by a sit spin,\u201d Victor says, sounding as if he\u2019s trying to recall them, even when both he and Yuuri know that he\u2019s doing it for Yuuri\u2019s sake, \u201cAfter that\u2026what was it again? Ah, yes, a triple toe loop and a triple flip combination.\u201d Yuuri remembers this part, remembers the impossibly numerous times he\u2019s had to do it in practice again and again. He remembers the memorable time Victor skated to the middle of the rink in his excitement to kiss Yuuri stupid when he landed both consecutive jumps cleanly. \u201cAnd then, a\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2014triple Lutz, and a combination spin for the ending,\u201d Yuuri recites. He glances to the side, where Victor is smiling at him with the slightest hints of worry in his eyes, and Yuuri manages a brave smile in return. He feels better, if not a little chilly.</p>\n<p>Yuuri braces himself as the contestant on the ice finishes his performance and the speakers announce his name next\u2014it\u2019s his turn to skate. Victor fusses with his hair in the last minute, smoothing out strands that stick out of place.</p>\n<p>\u201cAlright,\u201d Victor says once he\u2019s satisfied, \u201cgo seduce me, my sexy Katsudon.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yuuri wants to protest at the ridiculous nickname but before he can say anything, Victor is crowding into his space for their traditional \u201cgood luck\u201d hug, squeezing Yuuri tight and strong, like Victor\u2019s trying to transfer all his confidence and skating talent to Yuuri through touch alone. Any fear left in Yuuri leaves immediately and he sinks into the embrace, barely able to hug Victor back with his arms pinned to his sides.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019d kiss you good luck,\u201d Victor whispers in his ear teasingly, \u201cbut I might end up causing a scandal.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLet\u2019s not do that,\u201d Yuuri says, feeling a little breathless as Victor finally lets him go. He looks at Victor, at the ocean eyes soft and warm on him, and nods. \u201cThank you,\u201d he tells Victor. \u201cKeep your eyes on me, okay?\u201d</p>\n<p>Victor smiles. \u201cAlways.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yuuri steps into the rink and skates with his arms spread wide and high, baring himself to the crowd and the audience goes <em>wild</em>. His step sequence is dazzling, his jumps all brilliantly landed. For a moment in his performance, Yuuri can almost swear he caught Victor wolf-whistling at him.</p>\n<p>By the end of the night, he wins first place by a wide margin, and the minute they\u2019re back to their hotel room, Victor rewards him with more than just a kiss.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>4.</p>\n<p>On cold nights, Victor is like a personal space heater.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s March, just a month shy of being one year since Victor first came to Hasetsu, Japan declaring that he\u2019ll be Yuuri\u2019s new skating coach. Though it\u2019s supposed to be the start of spring, the snow outside is still heavy enough that Victor is entranced.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s just like Russia,\u201d Victor says with the barest hints of nostalgia coloring his voice, his blue eyes transfixed as they watch the snowflakes descend from the dark sky. From the side, Yuuri looks at him in turn with a mix of fondness and guilt.</p>\n<p>Fondness, because how can he not be fond?</p>\n<p>It seems to be Yuuri\u2019s default emotion nowadays when it comes to Victor. The Russian man is achingly beautiful in the low light of the room, his features almost angelic as he stares up into the heavens, blinking slowly. He\u2019s wearing the inn\u2019s green robe, a thick blanket pulled over his shoulders to fight off the cold and he looks so warm that Yuuri has half a mind to snuggle right up next to him.</p>\n<p>And guilt because, well\u2026as thrilled as Yuuri is that Victor is here, it <em>has</em> been almost a year since Victor last went back home to Russia. Seeing Victor stare at the snowfall, Yuuri can\u2019t help but think he\u2019s being incredibly selfish, keeping Victor with him.</p>\n<p>Just as Yuuri is shoving the thought away, Victor turns to look at him and smiles, all twinkling eyes and tender expression. Yuuri\u2019s breath catches in his throat, heart hammering in his chest. No matter many times Yuuri looks at him, the sight of Victor never quite stops giving him butterflies.</p>\n<p>\u201cYuuri,\u201d Victor calls brightly, beckoning him over by raising a blanket-covered arm, \u201ccome here and cuddle with me!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNext to an open window while it\u2019s snowing?\u201d Yuuri asks, amused. \u201cI\u2019d freeze.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNoooo,\u201d Victor drawls out, flapping his hand in a persistent \u2018come here\u2019 motion. With the blanket draped over his arm and following the movement, he looks ridiculously adorable. \u201cYou won\u2019t, I\u2019ll keep you warm.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yuuri highly doubts it\u2014he can feel the chilly outside air even from across the room\u2014but he makes his way to Victor nonetheless, because he\u2019s too weak for Victor and can\u2019t say \u2018no\u2019 to any of his whims. As soon as Yuuri gets near the window, he feels the biting sting of the frigid air against his skin, hitting his face.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s so cold here,\u201d Yuuri protests, a little surprised that Victor seems unaffected. He can feel shivers travelling through his body already. \u201cHow can you stand sitting here for so long?\u201d</p>\n<p>Victor opens his arms to invite Yuuri under the blanket and into his embrace, grinning when Yuuri all but dives in to escape the chill. \u201cIt\u2019s not that cold,\u201d Victor notes as he shifts in place until Yuuri is between his legs and Victor can drape himself over Yuuri like the blanket is draped over him. \u201cWinter in St. Petersburg is much colder in comparison.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yuuri pauses as soon as Victor wraps his arms around him, his eyes going wide with awe. \u201cYou\u2019re so warm,\u201d He says with a gasp of disbelief and Victor\u2019s eyebrows jump, taken aback. Yuuri grabs Victor\u2019s hands before the older man can react and promptly presses them up against his cold face, letting out an embarrassing sound of happiness as the heat from Victor\u2019s palms seeps into his skin. \u201cVictor, you\u2019re so <em>warm.</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, Yuuri,\u201d Victor corrects, and Yuuri can feel his teasing grin where Victor\u2019s mouth is brushing against his cheek, \u201cI\u2019m hot.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t start,\u201d Yuuri warns.</p>\n<p>Distractedly, he hears Victor laughing in his ear but Yuuri is too busy being amazed with his discovery because Victor is <em>so warm</em> <em>and soft and comfortable</em>, he feels like\u2014</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2014a kotatsu,\u201d Yuuri sighs, burrowing further into Victor\u2019s hug. Blue eyes blink down at him, Victor\u2019s face alight with childlike curiosity.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s a <em>kotatsu</em>?\u201d Victor asks in the same manner in which he asked what Hatsetsu Castle was months ago.</p>\n<p>Yuuri tries to think of how to best explain what it is. \u201cWell, a <em>kotatsu</em> is a low wooden table that has a heating system built inside, either electric or a charcoal heat source, and is covered by a heavy blanket. Most Japanese households have it for winter season.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh!\u201d Victor\u2019s expression is bright with understanding. \u201cHeater tables!\u201d</p>\n<p>Yuuri cracks a smile, nodding in defeat. So much for a proper explanation. \u201cWell, yeah, I guess. Heater tables.\u201d</p>\n<p>Victor kisses his temple with a laugh, dropping his hands from Yuuri\u2019s face to intertwine his fingers with Yuuri\u2019s. \u201cSo you think I\u2019m like a heating system? I\u2019m touched, Yuuri. But I\u2019m built to be stronger against cold weather, you know,\u201d Victor says playfully, nuzzling at Yuuri\u2019s dark hair. \u201cOtherwise, I won\u2019t survive in Russia at all,<em> solnyshko</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>There it is again, that passing tinge of sadness in Victor\u2019s voice as he mentions his home country. Yuuri peers at him hesitantly, unsure how to broach the topic. After a beat of silence, with Victor turning his attention back to snowfall outside, Yuuri decides to just go for it.</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you miss Russia, Victor?\u201d Yuuri asks, glancing out of the window. The snowflakes are dancing with the cold winter breeze, making a flurry of white dust, and it\u2019s a beautiful sight, really. Mercilessly cold perhaps, but still, beautiful.</p>\n<p>Yuuri wonders if Russia is the same.</p>\n<p>Victor makes a considering noise. \u201cA little,\u201d Victor admits quietly. Yuuri squeezes his hands in reassurance. \u201cI miss the familiar places. I miss eating <em>blini.</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>Yuuri turns to him. \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Blini</em>, Russian crepes,\u201d Victor answers, and presses another kiss on the slope of Yuuri\u2019s nose. He laughs a little at how Yuuri goes cross-eyed at the action. \u201cI\u2019ll make them for you some time. They\u2019re delicious.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMm,\u201d Yuuri agrees. He snuggles into Victor, burying his head on the crook of Victor\u2019s neck. When hands fall in front of his stomach, stroking the soft flesh adoringly, Yuuri sighs. \u201cWhat else do you miss?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMy apartment. The coffee shop near my block that makes the best latte. Yura,\u201d Victor says.</p>\n<p>\u201cYura?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYurio,\u201d Victor clarifies with a small smile. \u201cWell, Yuri. Yura is his nickname.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI miss him, too,\u201d Yuuri says, playing with the cloth of Victor\u2019s robe. \u201cHe livens up things around here.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cReally?\u201d Victor raises an eyebrow. \u201cEven when he calls you piggy?\u201d</p>\n<p>Yuuri snorts. \u201cOkay, maybe not then. But he\u2019s got his endearing moments.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI know,\u201d Victor sounds positively gleeful, \u201cHe\u2019s so cute, isn\u2019t he? So tiny and violent. Like a fluffy kitten with anger management issues.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cVictor,\u201d Yuuri scolds with a smothered laugh, half-heartedly swatting at him. Victor grins. \u201cDon\u2019t make fun of him.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut you agree with me!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cStop it.\u201d</p>\n<p>When their amusement dies down and makes way for the silence to take over again, Yuuri gathers up his courage, and finally asks, \u201cDo you want to go back to Russia?\u201d</p>\n<p>The wait is suffocating.</p>\n<p>Victor is quiet for a long time, as if he hasn\u2019t heard the question, or at least stubbornly pretends not to have heard it, and Yuuri almost thinks asking has been a mistake but just as he\u2019s beginning to decide to drop the topic, Victor\u2019s answer leaves him as a heavy exhale.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Victor whispers. He seems weary, all of a sudden. \u201cNot particularly, no.\u201d</p>\n<p>The answer feels wrong in a number of ways. Not to mention, confusing. But Yuuri bites back his words, swallows and pushes down on the urge to know more, to understand why. It\u2019s not his place to pry. Victor himself will tell him when he\u2019s ready to tell him.</p>\n<p>So for now, Yuuri nods his head and brushes soft kisses on the hollow of Victor\u2019s throat, smiling when Victor breathes easily once more. \u201cOkay,\u201d Yuuri says as one of his hands finds its way over to Victor\u2019s chest. Yuuri counts the heartbeat thrumming underneath his touch, and closes his eyes. He hopes Victor knows he\u2019s there for him. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>5.</p>\n<p>When he\u2019s sick, Victor is absolutely downright clingy.</p>\n<p>Even more so than usual, behaving like a stubborn child as he refused to let go of Yuuri\u2014he grips at Yuuri like he\u2019s touch-starved.</p>\n<p>\u201cVictor,\u201d Yuuri tries to reason for the third time around, mindful to keep his voice soft. He knows Victor is feeling terrible, and losing patience with him won\u2019t be beneficial to either of them, but Victor isn\u2019t helping himself by not allowing Yuuri to fetch his medicine. \u201cVictor, I\u2019ll be back in a minute, I promise, but I really have to get Ibuprofen for you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t want it,\u201d Victor rasps weakly from where he\u2019s been bundled up by Yuuri\u2019s mom in layers of blankets. He\u2019s trembling and his breath is coming in short and shallow, no doubt experiencing chills. What they first thought was just a common cold is turning out to be a bad flu. \u201cJust stay, Yuuri,\u201d Victor says and there\u2019s something in his voice that strikes Yuuri wrong.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou really need it,\u201d Yuuri tries again, pulling away from Victor\u2019s grasp. Victor is too weak to hold on to him properly. \u201cWe need to get your fever down. I\u2019ll be quick.\u201d</p>\n<p>On the bed, Victor shuts his eyes in pain, dropping his hand uselessly on the mattress. It seems like his headache is worsening. \u201cOkay,\u201d Victor whispers as Yuuri\u2019s halfway out the door, \u201cbut please come back.\u201d</p>\n<p>The plea weighs heavy on his chest.</p>\n<p>Yuuri all but half-runs to the kitchen to grab the medicine and a glass of water, and then back to Victor\u2019s room in his haste to return. When he opens the door and walks to the bed, he finds Victor with his eyes still pressed closed, tears sliding past his lashes, and Yuuri\u2019s heart breaks completely at the sight.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey,\u201d Yuuri fusses gently as soon as he places the glass and the medicine by the bedside table, taking a seat at the edge of the bed. He cups Victor\u2019s alarmingly warm cheek with a hand, thumb brushing away the tears. Victor sighs raggedly and presses into his touch. \u201cHey, what\u2019s wrong? Does something hurt, Victor?\u201d</p>\n<p>Victor shakes his head a little, and then erupts into a harsh coughing fit that looks as painful as it sounds. Yuuri supports him into sitting, handing Victor the medicine and guiding his grip on the glass as Victor drinks from it. Once he\u2019s settled down on the bed again, Yuuri cards his fingers through Victor\u2019s hair, smiling worriedly as the older man relaxes under his touch.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re back,\u201d Victor mumbles, eyes heavy with exhaustion as he looks up at Yuuri. He looks awfully relieved, as if the concept of Yuuri going away and abandoning him is even a possibility.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, yeah,\u201d Yuuri says with a heavy swallow, \u201cI told you I\u2019d be quick, didn\u2019t I?\u201d He doesn\u2019t understand what happened to Victor before that makes him so scared of the thought of being left behind. It hurts Yuuri more than it should that he\u2019s helpless to do anything about whatever it is in Victor\u2019s past that\u2019s haunting him now. \u201cOf course I\u2019d come back, Victor.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCome here,\u201d Victor croaks, opening his arms feebly. It\u2019s the only invitation Yuuri needs before he\u2019s slipping under the covers with Victor, disregarding the excessive warmth Victor is radiating as he hugs Yuuri tight. He scoots up a little until Victor\u2019s head is pillowed comfortably on his collarbone and presses a kiss on his forehead. Victor sighs.</p>\n<p>\u201cYuuri,\u201d Victor starts in a hushed voice, \u201care you happy?\u201d</p>\n<p>Yuuri blinks. \u201cWell, no, you\u2019re terribly sick\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWith me,\u201d Victor adds. He shifts a little, hiding his face into Yuuri\u2019s shirt. \u201cAre you happy with me?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Yuuri breathes. He runs a hand through Victor\u2019s hair again, knowing it soothes him. \u201cI\u2019m really happy with you, Victor.\u201d</p>\n<p>Victor nods a little. \u201cGood.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you?\u201d Yuuri can\u2019t help but ask next. \u201cAre you happy with me? With this?\u201d</p>\n<p>This time, Victor hugs him tighter, tiredly pressing a kiss on whichever part of Yuuri he can reach first.</p>\n<p>\u201cI am now,\u201d Victor whispers.</p>\n<p>Before Yuuri can ask what he means, Victor takes a deep breath and sags against him, falling asleep again. Yuuri sigh shakily, looking down at the man holding him as if he\u2019s something precious.</p>\n<p>He hugs Victor back just as tight, and Yuuri wishes he can keep him happy for as long as possible.</p>\n<p>+1</p>\n<p>Katsuki Yuuri is not a tactile man.</p>\n<p>Anyone who\u2019s spent a minute with him can tell you that much.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s not because he\u2019s Japanese, either. His parents have raised him and his sister with a fair amount of hugs and touches, and they\u2019re always generous with affection. He has grown up used to being Mari\u2019s human teddy bear when they were younger. Yuuko is the same\u2014Yuuri remembers blushing so much whenever Yuuko holds his hand as they walk to the skating rink back in the old days. Minako-sensei is pretty casual with her touches, too, giving Yuuri proud hugs whenever he wins and sympathetic ones when he loses.</p>\n<p>Even Phichit is a hugger, though it has taken at least three months before Yuuri can be comfortable with his rink mate touching him.</p>\n<p>So while everyone else around him is touchy-feely, Yuuri is simply\u2026not. It\u2019s just the way he is, and his family and friends have long since accepted that.</p>\n<p>Victor, however\u2014</p>\n<p>To say that Victor is touchy-feely is the understatement of the century.</p>\n<p>Victor Nikiforov, fifth time Grand Prix Final gold medalist, living legend of the figure skating community, has no sense of shame whatsoever. He has no qualms being stark naked during his and Yuuri\u2019s first meeting (granted, they were at the hot springs and Yuuri did walk into Victor bathing, but still), holding Yuuri\u2019s hand and putting their faces so close, Yuuri can feel Victor\u2019s breath ghosting against his lips. It\u2019s only gotten significantly worse the longer they spent time around each other\u2014ironically, it\u2019s gotten significantly better at the same time.</p>\n<p>Yuuri isn\u2019t a tactile person but he does get used to receiving certain touches from certain people. He\u2019s learned to acclimatize to Victor\u2019s touches the way a dog would acclimatize to water, learning how to swim, learning how to go farther away from the shore without drowning, and somewhere along the way the dog has turned into a fish and the water has become an ocean, and the analogy is quickly losing sense but that\u2019s exactly what their situation is.</p>\n<p>In the months they\u2019ve spent with each other, Yuuri has been submerged in Victor\u2019s hugs and touches, has spent days breathing against the other man\u2019s skin, has spent nights curled up with Victor\u2019s warmth and softness surrounding him, taking in the scent of aftershave and cologne and something that\u2019s distinctly <em>Victor</em>, and Yuuri has all but accepted it as part of his daily life.</p>\n<p>Yuuri is <em>not </em>a tactile person. (Yes, this is worth repeating thrice.)</p>\n<p>But when Victor just stops touching him, without explanation, without reason, it makes for a painfully jarring experience.</p>\n<p>They\u2019re in Russia for the Grand Prix Finals and as soon as the plane landed, Victor has kept a safe distance away Yuuri, putting at least two meters between them at all times. He doesn\u2019t hug Yuuri, doesn\u2019t touch Yuuri, doesn\u2019t even try to pull Yuuri into a traditional airport selfie to post in his Instagram account. What\u2019s worse is that Victor is smiling and laughing normally all the while, as if he\u2019s clueless about the whole thing.</p>\n<p>Yuuri has never felt so lost before.</p>\n<p>\u201cVictor,\u201d Yuuri begins hesitantly as they get into a cab and Victor speaks a long string of Russian to give the driver the directions to the hotel they\u2019ll be staying in. \u201cVictor.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cJust a second, Yuuri.\u201d</p>\n<p>The way Victor says his name dismissively, like they are strangers who just met and happened to share a cab, hits a chord in Yuuri\u2019s heart. It hurts, and Yuuri is so confused.</p>\n<p>\u201cVictor,\u201d He tries again once Victor is done talking to the cabbie, and reaches a hand out to touch his shoulder, to ask what\u2019s wrong, if he did something wrong, \u201cIs everything okay\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>Victor flinches away before Yuuri can touch him.</p>\n<p>Flinches.</p>\n<p>Like Yuuri is something horrible and unworthy, and Victor is staring at him with wide-eyed alarm.</p>\n<p>Yuuri doesn\u2019t know what expression he\u2019s wearing, and belatedly, he thinks he doesn\u2019t care. His chest feels frozen, his lungs not breathing and his heart having dropped down to his gut like a stone. He\u2019s back in Russia, and Yuuri feels like the world has crashed down onto him once again.</p>\n<p>\u201cYuuri,\u201d Victor starts except Yuuri doesn\u2019t want to listen anymore. He turns away without another word and stares out the window. It\u2019s snowing, just like the last time Yuuri\u2019s been in Russia. Like last time as well, Yuuri pretends that there aren\u2019t tears welling up and threatening to fall from his eyes.</p>\n<p>Russia is beautiful. Mercilessly cold and cruel, but beautiful.</p>\n<p>The cab ride is spent in silence.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u00a0</p>\n<p>When they get to their hotel room, Yuuri finds that the sight of two beds irritates him more than it should. Normally, Victor prefers the left bed and Yuuri lets him have it, but today, Yuuri marches inside with his carry-on, ignoring Victor\u2019s footsteps right behind him, and drops it on the bed on the left, effectively claiming it as his own.</p>\n<p>Victor places his bags next to the bed on the right without a protest.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll shower first,\u201d Victor says, looking at him, and Yuuri pretends not to hear him as he rummages his bag for his phone. He\u2019s being petty, Yuuri knows it, and it makes him feel even worse but he doesn\u2019t exactly know how to stop. There\u2019s a tired sigh, and then Victor\u2019s footsteps are heard as he crosses his way over to the bathroom. He closes the door as quietly as possible but it still sounds much too loud for Yuuri, who wants to be anywhere else but here.</p>\n<p>He showers right after Victor\u2019s done, and Yuuri must\u2019ve taken longer than he thought, because as he gets out of the bath, the lights are turned off inside the room, and Victor is curled up in his bed, asleep.</p>\n<p><em>It\u2019s just a misunderstanding</em>, Yuuri thinks glumly with a sigh, dragging himself over to his own bed. It feels empty, cold without Victor in it. <em>We\u2019re probably both tired. We\u2019ll sort it out in the morning. </em>It takes him a while before he can fall asleep, slumber evading him just like Victor evaded his touch. Yuuri swallows painfully at the reminder and turns in his bed, restless. The minutes tick on, tauntingly slow.</p>\n<p>\u201cYuuri?\u201d Victor calls his name in the dark after what seems like hours, and Yuuri stills. \u201cAre you still awake?\u201d</p>\n<p>Yuuri doesn\u2019t answer. He doesn\u2019t know what to say, or what to do, and he doesn\u2019t know if responding will help get them out of their situation. So Yuuri keeps his eyes closed and his breath as even as possible, even as he hears Victor getting out of his own bed.</p>\n<p>His mattress dips as Victor sits carefully on the edge of his bed, his hand soft and hesitant as it brushes against Yuuri\u2019s cheek, before carding through his dark hair. Yuuri relaxes despite himself. \u201cOh, <em>solnyshko</em>,\u201d Victor murmurs, and Yuuri can almost taste the sadness in Victor\u2019s mouth. He instantly feels guilty for ignoring Victor earlier. \u201cI am so, so sorry. I wish I explained it to you.\u201d</p>\n<p><em>Then explain it to me now</em>, Yuuri thinks desperately. Fighting with Victor (is this a fight? Yuuri doesn\u2019t even understand why they\u2019re fighting) is absolutely terrible.</p>\n<p>Before Yuuri can reveal that he\u2019s awake, Victor is leaning down, pressing a kiss on his temple with a sigh. \u201cGood night, Yuuri.\u201d</p>\n<p>It\u2019s one of the worst nights of Yuuri\u2019s life.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u00a0</p>\n<p>The morning that follows is just as horrible, if not even more.</p>\n<p>Victor doesn\u2019t explain anything. He\u2019s still avoiding Yuuri, still pretending like nothing\u2019s wrong as he holds a Russian conversation with the housekeeper and apparently says something so funny that the woman feels the need to laugh so hard, she clutches Victor\u2019s bicep for support. Victor isn\u2019t grinning like he enjoys it, but he doesn\u2019t do anything about the woman either, who keeps on shamelessly groping his arm.</p>\n<p>From where he\u2019s sitting on the bed and preparing his things before they go to the ice rink for the competition, Yuuri watches the scene looking like he bit into a lemon. \u201cExplain it better, my ass,\u201d Yuuri mutters bitterly under his breath as he shoves his skates into his bag with more force than necessary and the housekeeper finally exits.</p>\n<p>When they go out of the room and into the bustle in the hotel lobby, it gets even worse.</p>\n<p>Victor keeps his distance, walking apart from Yuuri like they\u2019re not even together and Yuuri has the strongest urge to yank him close just so he can pinch Victor. The whole thing is grating on his nerves, and by the time they reach the stadium through a 30-minute cab ride, Yuuri is too keyed up with annoyance to even be nervous about competing in the Grand Prix Finals.</p>\n<p>The greatest highlight of Yuuri's skating career, and it\u2019s being ruined by a lover\u2019s spat between them.</p>\n<p>\u201cYuuri,\u201d Victor says to him as they enter the venue, \u201cstay close so you don\u2019t get lost, okay?\u201d</p>\n<p>Yuuri ignores him, navigating through the crowd of people. They don\u2019t talk again after that.</p>\n<p>With his rotten luck, Yuuri draws the first spot. Again.</p>\n<p>He does his interviews alone, unlike their usual practice with Victor answering right next to him. When the reporters ask about him and his coach, Yuuri pretends not to understand perfectly clear English and resorts to bowing and apologizing in Japanese until they leave him alone.</p>\n<p>Yuuri runs through his choreography in the ice along with the other competitors before the program starts and messes up his triple flip twice. His spins are lackluster. He can\u2019t even land the quadruple Salchow. When he skates back to their area to drink, the way Victor doesn\u2019t even lecture him speaks volumes.</p>\n<p>They suffer in tense silence before a voice cuts through it, and both of them turn to look at Yurio approaching. \u201cTook you long enough to get your asses here,\u201d Yurio says in greeting, already glaring at the two of them. Yuuri blinks at the teenager with his lips pursed, and averts his eyes. He can\u2019t even find it in himself to tolerate Yurio\u2019s usual bluster.</p>\n<p>\u201cHi, Yurio,\u201d Victor greets with a smile but it\u2019s too forced, drawn too thin, and his teasing falls short. Yurio narrows his eyes at them, taking in the oddly huge space in between their seats on the bench and the tension that hangs heavy in the atmosphere.</p>\n<p>Yurio frowns, confused. \u201cWhat the fuck is wrong with you two?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNothing,\u201d Yuuri says, at the same time Victor scolds, \u201cLanguage.\u201d They don\u2019t even look at each other.</p>\n<p>Yurio pointedly arches an eyebrow, pushing his point across.</p>\n<p><em>It\u2019s embarrassing</em>, Yuuri thinks as he stands all of a sudden, startling the two Russians, <em>that even a sixteen year-old can see through us.</em></p>\n<p>Yuuri starts to walk away when Victor calls after him tensely. \u201cWhere are you going?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMen\u2019s room,\u201d Yuuri bites back, and keeps on walking.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u00a0</p>\n<p>Yuuri finds himself alone in the comfort room, and seeing the red cubicles again reminds him too much of the time he lost the Grand Prix Finals and went here to cry. He shoves down the urge to lock himself inside a cubicle and repeat history, and instead makes a beeline for the sink. The first splash of water against his face is an icy shock, and he does it again and again until his lips are pale and his face is numb with the cold. Yuuri lets out a weary sigh as he lets the water drip from his face, washing his hands under the open faucet.</p>\n<p>They\u2019re still fighting and Yuuri <em>still </em>doesn\u2019t know why.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s an incredibly frustrating ordeal, as it turns out, and Yuuri is stuck glowering sullenly at his reflection in the mirror like it will give him the solution to his problems. Yuuri looks down at the porcelain bowl, gripping the edge of the sink tightly. If only Victor will explain himself properly for once, instead of making everything needlessly complicated and confusing.</p>\n<p>A man enters then, no bigger or taller than Yuuri, and Yuuri glances up in reflex, meeting his gaze through the mirror. The man takes a sweeping look at him, at the glitters in his clothes, and a sour expression takes over his face. Yuuri drops his eyes back down. This isn\u2019t the first time he\u2019s encountered men like this one, who frown at their tight costumes and dismiss figure skating as a girly sport. Yuuri just wishes he didn\u2019t encounter one today. As if his day can\u2019t be any worse.</p>\n<p>The man uses the faucet right next to him, closer to the exit, just as Yuuri moves away from his and dries his hands. Yuuri is making his way to the door, passing by the other man, when he\u2019s shoved away so suddenly with enough force that Yuuri slams into a cubicle and his shoulder rams painfully against the hard plastic.</p>\n<p>The noise echoes like an explosion, bouncing against the tiles.</p>\n<p>Brown eyes shoot wide open in shock and Yuuri looks at the man in a mix of disbelief and anger. That is so far from an accident. \u201cExcuse me,\u201d Yuuri spits, pushing himself off the cubicle wall. His shoulder throbs, a red hot pain shooting down his arm, and Yuuri hopes it\u2019s just a bruise.</p>\n<p>\u201cGo back to your country,\u201d the man sneers in his broken English, heavily laced with a Russian accent. He looks at Yuuri the way someone looks down on a cockroach. \u201cYou\u2019re one of gays, no? Disgusting piece of shit.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yuuri opens his mouth, offended and ready to call out the guy\u2019s bigotry, when suddenly everything clicks into place.</p>\n<p>He knows why Victor won\u2019t touch him.</p>\n<p>He knows why Victor only kissed him in the middle of the night, when no one else was around.</p>\n<p><em>Of course</em>, is what crosses Yuuri\u2019s mind, and his breath leaves him all at once. <em>I should have known.</em></p>\n<p>They\u2019re in <em>Russia</em>, and suddenly, it makes perfect sense that Victor didn\u2019t really want to go back home before. Because now that they\u2019re here, they can\u2019t act like they always do, they can\u2019t hug, can\u2019t kiss, can\u2019t put a name to what they actual are simply because too many people in this godforsaken country refuse to acknowledge it as something natural.</p>\n<p><em>Victor</em>, Yuuri thinks with a pang of guilt, <em>I have to apologize to him.</em></p>\n<p>The man says something harsh and vaguely threatening in Russian, and Yuuri is cut off from his thoughts. He clenches his fists, grimacing at the rude man in front of him, and shakes his head. \u201cI have no time for you,\u201d Yuuri says, already turning on his heel. He doesn\u2019t want to waste any more time talking to this homophobic man when he can be sorting things out with Victor.</p>\n<p>Just as Yuuri\u2019s almost out the door, he hears one last insult directed at him.</p>\n<p>\u201cFucking faggot.\u201d</p>\n<p>And for some reason, Yuuri stops, glued to the spot.</p>\n<p>His ears ring with white noise.</p>\n<p>The word is sickening, tasting like ashes on the back of his throat and feeling like acid in his chest.</p>\n<p>Yuuri turns to face the man again, his dark eyes unblinking and his breath shallow. \u201cWhat did you call me?\u201d He asks, deceptively calm. His blood is like ice in his veins, sharp and cold, and Yuuri feels sick to the gut, outrage pooling in his chest. Decent Japanese people have enough politeness not to say that word, and Yuuri has only ever encountered it on the internet. Even back in Detroit, the worst he\u2019s been called by the most ignorant people is \u201cgirly\u201d or \u201closer\u201d but not that.</p>\n<p>Never that.</p>\n<p>\u201cI said,\u201d the man takes a step forward, damn near spitting on Yuuri\u2019s face and Yuuri squeezes his fists tightly until his knuckles are shaking and his arm is all but ready to draw back, and for the first time ever, he wants to punch someone, he wants to punch <em>this man</em>, and <em>he will</em>, if he hears that revolting word again, <em>Yuuri will hit him, </em>\u201cyou are fucking fa\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOI, YUURI YOU MORON!\u201d</p>\n<p>Yurio\u2019s scream sends Yuuri crashing back into reality. He whirls around sharply, facing Yurio, just as the teenager roughly yanks at his elbow and makes him stumble back, away from the man. Yuuri releases a tight breath he hasn\u2019t known he was holding and blinks rapidly, shaking as red fades from his sight. He almost punched another person<em>.</em></p>\n<p>\n<em>He almost punched another person.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you fucking messing around?\u201d Yurio snarls, scolding him for reasons Yuuri doesn\u2019t even know and blatantly ignoring the only other person in the comfort room. \u201cThe goddamn program\u2019s about to start, what the hell are you doing here, having tea?!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI was\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t care!\u201d Yurio snaps, tugging at his wrist again. \u201cWe\u2019re going back NOW.\u201d</p>\n<p>The blond pushes Yuuri forward, towards the exit while he grumbles under his breath. Before they can completely go out of the bathroom, however, Yurio turns to look back at the man and Yuuri glances at the teenager just in time to see him giving the coldest glare he can muster, mouth pulling back in a snarl. Yuuri suddenly remembers his unpleasant first meeting with Yurio.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe hell you looking at, you son of a bitch?\u201d Yurio\u2019s voice is a low growl, too deep for a sixteen year-old. He keeps his ice blue eyes pinned on the scowling man, and says, \u201cDon\u2019t think I fucking missed what you did. You have less than five minutes to get the fuck out of here before I call security on your ugly ass.\u201d</p>\n<p>And just like that, Yurio grabs his wrist and pulls Yuuri away, marching back towards the stadium like nothing happened. Yuuri\u2019s head spins, disoriented.</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d Yurio throws the question over his shoulder, glancing back at Yuuri. His mouth is pulled thin, frowning, and something like concern lingers in his eyes. \u201cYou don\u2019t have any bruises. Did he hit you anywhere under the collar?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe shoved me,\u201d Yuuri says blankly and feels a little like throwing up at what just took place. He almost punched someone. \u201cI think I have a bruise on my arm but I\u2019m okay.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yurio gives a terse nod. \u201cThat\u2019s good,\u201d He says, and then glances back once more, almost incredulous this time. \u201cWere you seriously about to hit that guy?\u201d</p>\n<p>Yuuri winces at the reminder. He doesn\u2019t want to think about it again, but if Yurio wasn\u2019t there to stop him, Yuuri fears he might have done just that. Maybe his temperament isn\u2019t as good as he thinks.</p>\n<p>\u201cI mean, don\u2019t get me wrong,\u201d Yurio snorts, shaking his head, \u201cyou have a lot more spine than I thought, but you\u2019re a lot dumber, too. Something like that happens, you don\u2019t throw the first punch. You\u2019re gonna get yourself fucking killed.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yuuri swallows tightly. \u201cYou heard him,\u201d He croaks in an attempt to explain, \u201cHe called me a\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI know,\u201d Yurio cuts him off, pained. He sounds revolted, too, and rightfully indignant, like Yuuri was minutes ago. The teenager\u2019s voice trembles as he adds, \u201cI\u2019ve heard people call Victor that too many times before. He\u2019s smart, unlike you. He never fought back. I hate it.\u201d</p>\n<p>At the revelation, Yuuri\u2019s eyes press shut, stinging with unbidden tears. <em>God,</em> that sounds so horrible, Yuuri can\u2019t even imagine going through it. He almost wishes he threw the punch, after all.</p>\n<p>\u201cLook,\u201d Yurio snaps at him again, and Yuuri\u2019s eyes open, \u201cthey\u2019re assholes, okay? They are so fucking messed up. You can\u2019t listen to them.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI know, Yuri,\u201d Yuuri tells him gently. Despite his reputation as the Russian Punk, Yuuri knows Yurio is only a kid, no matter how much he pretends otherwise. The teenager seems as shaken up as he is. Yuuri gives the boy\u2019s wrist a squeeze, a little proud at how Yurio handled the situation. \u201cI know. Thank you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yurio nods again and doesn\u2019t say anything further as they go back to the rink. The stadium is more packed than before, the audience finally filling in and occupying their seats, and the announcers are telling the remaining contestants on the rink that warm-up has ended. They find their way back to Victor, who looks as agitated as he can be, his hands balled into fists and wrinkling his gloves, his eyes scanning the whole place.</p>\n<p>Once they\u2019re close enough, Victor catches sight of them and takes one look at Yurio\u2019s grim frown, Yuuri\u2019s unsettled expression and the way the younger boy is still clutching at Yuuri\u2019s hand like he\u2019s afraid something bad will happen to Yuuri if he doesn\u2019t keep a grip on him, before Victor inhales sharply, alarmed at once. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d Victor demands, scanning Yuuri\u2019s face for\u2026something, before he turns to Yurio and grimaces deeply. \u201cI told you to stay here. Where did you go?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMen\u2019s room,\u201d Yurio says, \u201cSome homophobic asshole had a problem with Yuuri.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYura,\u201d Victor hisses, fear flashing through his gaze, before continuing everything else in Russian, talking low and fast and harsh, and Yuuri\u2019s never seen Victor like this before\u2014angry enough to snarl, and so upset that his hands are shaking a little by his sides, his eyebrows furrowed, his blue eyes too wide and too glassy.</p>\n<p>\u201cVictor, it\u2019s not his fault,\u201d Yuuri starts and recoils when Victor turns his glare at him.</p>\n<p>\u201cDo you know how long you were gone? You had me worried!\u201d Victor bites back, furious. Distressed. Terrified.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Yuuri manages weakly.</p>\n<p>\u201cBoth of you!\u201d Victor grounds out, turning back to Yurio. \u201cYura, I told you not to leave the stadium. You could\u2019ve gotten in trouble\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>Yurio rolls his eyes. \u201cI was just helping\u2014\u201c</p>\n<p>\u201cYuuri is a grown man,\u201d Victor snaps, \u201cHe damn well knows how to take care of himself. You\u2019re <em>sixteen</em>! If anything happens to you, I can\u2019t\u2014\u201d Victor cuts himself off, muttering curses under his breath and looking away. The rim of his eyes are red, his jaw tight with tension, and Yurio takes a step back, blinking his wide eyes at Victor. He seems stunned, like he\u2019s seeing this side of Victor for the first time alongside Yuuri.</p>\n<p>Silence dawns over them with Victor glaring somewhere at the ice rink, Yurio still staring at Victor, and Yuuri torn between glancing at either Russian men. With an awkward cough, Yuuri gently nudges the boy, and when Yurio scowls at him, Yuuri tips his head towards Victor.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Yurio apologizes begrudgingly after a while, finally having the decency to look abashed, and Yuuri is immensely grateful that the teenager decided not to be stubborn anymore. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I lied about staying in the stadium. To answer your question, no, I didn\u2019t start a fight\u2014I ended one,\u201d He says, and at that, Victor gives Yuuri a brief, sharp glance, disbelieving. \u201cNo, I didn\u2019t get hit. I didn\u2019t hit anyone either.\u201d Yurio sighs, and then turns away from Victor. \u201cBut you\u2019re worrying over the wrong person, idiot.\u201d</p>\n<p>Victor grits his teeth. \u201cYura\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGoddammit, yes, I\u2019m fine! I won\u2019t do it again! You\u2019ve made your point, <em>Dad.</em>\u201d Yurio barks over his shoulder as he keeps walking. Victor doesn\u2019t look amused at the jab. \u201cI\u2019m going back to Yakov! Sort out your issues, will you?\u201d</p>\n<p>Victor lets out an aggravated sigh as he stares at Yurio walking away, checking to make sure the boy does go back to his area. He runs a hand through his hair in frustration, his other hand still clenched, as he takes several deep breaths. Victor turns to Yuuri after a moment, worry so tangible in his expression that Yuuri aches to be able to touch him again. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d Victor asks, still a little tense but calmer this time, reaching out for Yuuri\u2019s hand. \u201cWhat did they do? Did anyone hurt you?\u201d</p>\n<p><em>He\u2019s been through this before</em>, Yuuri realizes with a painful start of his heart, <em>Victor\u2019s been through worse than I have. </em></p>\n<p>He takes Victor\u2019s palm before the other man can change his mind, warm and trembling, and squeezes it briefly before forcing himself to let go. Yuuri hopes it\u2019s enough to reassure Victor in the meantime. \u201cSomeone shoved me and threw insults. I\u2019m okay,\u201d Yuuri says, and watches as Victor nods in relief, swallowing back his misery. Victor\u2019s blue eyes are still too glassy. \u201cVictor, I\u2019m okay,\u201d Yuuri repeats earnestly, desperate to make him stop hurting. \u201cI promise, I\u2019m fine.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Victor breathes out, dropping his head down. He releases a shuddering sigh, blinking rapidly. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Victor says, \u201cI should have explained better. I should have told you before we even boarded the plane.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d Yuuri shushes him, and Victor looks up. Yuuri shakes his head. \u201cI understand. I\u2019m sorry, too. I should have known.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYuuri,\u201d Victor hesitates, \u201cWhat happened yesterday, I want you to know that I\u2014\u201c</p>\n<p>The speakers come to life above the stadium, cutting Victor off as they announce the names of the contestants, and it\u2019s a rude reminder of where they are, what they came here for. Victor takes a deep breath, glancing up at the screens. A picture of Yuuri flashes in the screen briefly as it introduces him as the representative of Japan.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s a nice photo of you,\u201d Victor huffs softly as the moment between them fades away.</p>\n<p>Sighing, Yuuri takes off the covers from the blades of his skates and goes into the rink, waiting for the announcers to officially signal the start of his performance. He grips the edge of the wall, facing Victor. For the first time in his life, Yuuri thinks he\u2019s willing to trade skating, if it means being given a moment to talk to Victor properly.</p>\n<p>Yuuri takes a deep breath. \u201cVictor, I\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFocus on your performance,\u201d the other man tells him. Victor is leaning in, so they can talk in hushed voices, but it\u2019s still a far cry from their usual proximity. Victor offers him a smile, fragile and sad. Yuuri hates it, hates that he can\u2019t do anything to make Victor feel better. \u201cWe\u2019ll talk at the hotel later,\u201d Victor says, \u201cFor now, you\u2019re going to win a gold medal, and I\u2019m going to cheer for you every step of the way.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Yuuri nods, biting his lip. He\u2019s not worried about his performance; he\u2019s worried about <em>Victor. </em>Yuuri gives a quick look around. There are too many cameras on them, too many eyes watching. Yuuri never noticed them before, because Victor didn\u2019t care either way who saw them whenever he touched Yuuri, but now both of them are hyperaware of just how many people are looking at them.</p>\n<p>Touching Victor now isn\u2019t going to help.</p>\n<p>So Yuuri reverts back to the silly metaphor, in hopes of making Victor feel better. \u201cI\u2019ll be the tastiest Katsudon ever,\u201d Yuuri tells him seriously, watching Victor\u2019s eyebrows jump in surprise, \u201cso please watch me.\u201d</p>\n<p>It starts slow but soon, Victor\u2019s eyes are crinkling at the corners, his lips spreading wide around a startled laugh. \u201cAlways,\u201d Victor chuckles. His eyes are soft and warm on Yuuri. \u201cI love Katsudon.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI love Katsudon, too,\u201d Yuuri squeezes one of Victor's hands again quickly, and then skates into the middle of the rink as he\u2019s introduced, his arms raised high with all the confidence of a champion. The crowd cheers for him.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">.</p>\n<p>Yuuri wins gold in the Grand Prix Finals.</p>\n<p>It leads to countless of interviews and signatures and handshakes, Yuuri posing for photographs with the other contestants, with his fans, with other people who want to celebrate his triumph, too. Victor is proud of him\u2014of course he is, his blue eyes were all too glassy again during the Kiss and Cry when the judges showed Yuuri\u2019s score\u2014but the fact that he can\u2019t quite show it like he usually does puts a damper on both their spirits.</p>\n<p>They manage to return to the hotel room just before midnight. Neither of them talks, but there\u2019s Victor\u2019s hand on the dip of his back, a guiding support since Yuuri looks dead on his feet, and Yuuri\u2019s glad for the excuse. The elevator ride is silent, wordless up until Victor slides their key card and both of them shuffle inside the room. Yuuri locks the door behind them.</p>\n<p>They take turns showering, Yuuri first, and then Victor.</p>\n<p>Yuuri\u2019s sitting on the edge of Victor\u2019s bed when Victor finally gets out of the bathroom, and when Victor glances at him, Yuuri manages a small smile. \u201cHi.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHi,\u201d Victor echoes quietly. He looks his age, for once, tired and slow as he crosses the room and takes a seat next to Yuuri, careful not to make their legs touch. Instead of irritation, Yuuri\u2019s heart aches at the change. \u201cYou were wonderful tonight. I\u2019m proud of you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cVictor,\u201d Yuuri says, disregarding the praise. \u201cYou said we were going to talk. Please?\u201d</p>\n<p>Victor falls silent again, giving a reluctant nod. \u201cOkay,\u201d He says, taking a deep breath before facing Yuuri again, \u201cI\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t talk to you about this before we got here. I wasn\u2019t sure how to bring it up, and I didn\u2019t want you to think I\u2019m ashamed to be with you\u2014because I\u2019m not, Yuuri, I\u2019m not,\u201d Victor interjects immediately, clenching his jaw, \u201cI will never be ashamed of you. But living in Russia has made me\u2026defensive, and it was so difficult not to revert back into it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yuuri nods in understanding. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry,\u201d Victor says again. His hand twitches by his side, making an aborted movement to reach for Yuuri, but Victor grabs a fistful of the sheets instead. Yuuri doesn\u2019t miss it. \u201cI never wanted you to feel like I was avoiding you. That will never be my intention, <em>solnyshko.</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to apologize,\u201d Yuuri whispers with a shake of his head. His hand is restless on his lap as well, and he has the strong urge to brush back Victor\u2019s hair. \u201cI know it was difficult for you, too.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cEarlier,\u201d Victor begins hesitantly, \u201cyou said someone shoved you. Were you hurt?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cA little,\u201d Yuuri admits. He grasps the end of his shirt sleeve, hiking it up as carefully as possible to reveal the purple bruise hiding beneath the cloth. \u201cI slammed against the cubicle, so I got a bit\u2014\u201c</p>\n<p>Victor swears.</p>\n<p>Startled, Yuuri jerks his head to look at him again, suddenly worried. Victor looks like he\u2019s frozen in place, his wide blue eyes glued to the bruise and his expression tight. Victor blinks rapidly again, and Yuuri thinks he sees tears forming.</p>\n<p>\u201cVictor,\u201d Yuuri says softly, \u201cit\u2019s just a bruise. I\u2019ll be okay.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s never just a bruise,\u201d Victor croaks out, pained. He glares at the welt like he can feel the painful throb on his own arm, and Yuuri loathes the implication behind it. Victor grits his teeth again. \u201cYou said he threw insults?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u00a0Yuuri nods. \u201cYeah, he called me a,\u201d Yuuri\u2019s dignity won\u2019t let him say the word aloud, so he settles for shaking his head stubbornly. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter what he called me. He still didn\u2019t have a right to say that.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI know,\u201d Victor whispers miserably. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. It doesn\u2019t stop them from saying it anyway.\u201d He\u2019s curled into himself, broad shoulders pulled in to look smaller, and his eyes are pinned to the space between them. It\u2019s like he\u2019s got no strength left to be angry anymore, and Yuuri wonders how many times Victor had to deal with something like this by himself, until he was left weary.</p>\n<p>Afraid.</p>\n<p>Hopeless.</p>\n<p>Yuuri never wants to see him like this again.</p>\n<p>\u201cVictor,\u201d Yuuri says, and waits for the older man to look at him before he asks, \u201care there cameras in this room?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Victor frowns. \u201cNo.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAre we expecting anyone else to come here?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2014No.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo we\u2019re alone,\u201d Yuuri says. \u201cNo one\u2019s here to see us.\u201d</p>\n<p>Victor nods, confused. \u201cYes.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo I can do this, right?\u201d Yuuri reaches for his hand across the mattress, lacing their fingers together easily. Victor\u2019s eyes light up slowly in comprehension. The action is familiar, comforting, and Victor looks at their intertwined hands with something akin to\u00a0cautious hopefulness. Yuuri brings their laced hands to his lips, brushing a kiss against Victor\u2019s knuckles. Victor nods, breathless. \u201cCan I do this, too?\u201d Yuuri asks and then slides his free hand up against Victor\u2019s jaw, thumb brushing his cheekbone, and smiles a little at the long exhale Victor lets out.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d Victor rasps, closing his eyes and pressing into Yuuri\u2019s palm.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd this?\u201d Yuuri asks just before he\u2019s leaning in, slowly, giving Victor time to back away if he doesn\u2019t want it, and then his lips are meeting Victor\u2019s plush mouth, and Yuuri can taste his peppermint toothpaste, can feel the slight quiver of his lips.</p>\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d Victor sighs as they break apart. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m free to touch you here,\u201d Yuuri whispers. This time, it\u2019s no longer a question but Victor nods nonetheless, swallowing painfully. \u201cI can touch you, and I can hug you, and I can kiss you and hold you\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYuuri.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2014and no one can stop me,\u201d Yuuri breathes, brushing away the tears the slip away from the corners of Victor\u2019s eyes, down to his cheek, \u201cNo one can stop me from loving you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Yuuri.</em>\u201d Victor whispers roughly, voice breaking with emotion and his blue eyes shut tight, and when Yuuri pulls him into his arms, Victor melts against him completely, clinging to Yuuri like a lifeline.</p>\n<p>Yuuri isn\u2019t a tactile man; but as he holds Victor in his arms, his one hand splayed wide over his back and the other cradling the back of Victor\u2019s head, Yuuri realizes that he hugs in the most protective manner ever. \u201cI\u2019ve got you,\u201d Yuuri murmurs, burying a hand in Victor\u2019s soft hair as the other man hides his face on the crook of Yuuri\u2019 neck, sighing raggedly. He presses a kiss on the top of the silver mop of hair. \u201cI\u2019ve got you, Victor. I won\u2019t let them hurt you again.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou can\u2019t promise that, <em>solnyshko.</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI can try my best,\u201d Yuuri insists stubbornly, and Victor gives a wet chuckle inside his embrace. Yuuri rocks them gently from side to side, busying himself with playing with silver hair strands as Victor calms down little by little. \u201cEarlier, I was so angry, I think I almost punched the man. Yurio stopped me before I can do it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Victor presses a kiss on Yuuri\u2019s neck. \u201cDid you really?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Yuuri nods, absentmindedly rubbing Victor\u2019s back. \u201cI was terrified afterwards.\u201d</p>\n<p>Victor laughs a little at the admittance.</p>\n<p>\u201cIf I broke my hand, I think you would have yelled at me,\u201d Yuuri says.</p>\n<p>\u201cIf you broke your hand, I would have rushed you to the hospital first,\u201d Victor reasons, and then pauses, \u201cI would probably yell at you after.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThank goodness I didn\u2019t do it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMy <em>solnyshko</em>\u2019s so brave,\u201d Victor sighs, tracing patterns on Yuuri\u2019s shoulder blades, \u201cI never once thought of fighting back. You\u2019re much braver than I am, Yuuri.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s not true,\u201d Yuuri argues. \u201cI think you\u2019re brave for coming this far. Maybe you\u2019ve been brave for far too long.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d Victor relents. He shifts closer until he\u2019s almost sitting on Yuuri\u2019s lap and Yuuri only holds him tighter. It\u2019s quiet for a moment, and then Victor whispers, \u201cI miss Japan.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yuuri nods.</p>\n<p>\u201cI miss the onsen. I miss your mother\u2019s cooking. I miss Makkachin. I miss Jenga nights with your sister. I miss having this,\u201d Victor says, leaning up to kiss Yuuri. \u201cI miss having you. I miss home.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMe too,\u201d Yuuri whispers. \u201cMe too.\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"center\">.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">.</p>\n<p>Tomorrow morning, Victor holds Yuuri\u2019s hand and doesn\u2019t let go.</p>\n<p>He holds Yuuri\u2019s hand as they walk out of the hotel, uncaring of the murmurs.</p>\n<p>He holds Yuuri\u2019s hand in the cab ride to the airport, ignoring the looks of the cab driver.</p>\n<p>They hold hands throughout the plane ride.</p>\n<p>When they land on Japan, finally, Victor kisses Yuuri.</p>\n<p>\u201cI can touch you again,\u201d Victor says in awe, and Yuuri falls a little deeper in love with him.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u00a0</p>\n<p align=\"center\">.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\u00a0</p>\n<p>During the mornings, Victor hugs like an octopus.</p>\n<p>He knows this. (He does have self-awareness.)</p>\n<p>But the morning after they return from Russia, Victor wakes up in confusion, disoriented at the added weight across his chest. There\u2019s Yuuri\u2019s arm thrown over him, toned legs tangled with his own. Yuuri\u2019s the one clinging to him this morning, instead of the usual way around.\u00a0Victor grins at the adorable sight, kissing Yuuri\u2019s nose. \u201cGood morning, <em>solnyshko.</em>\u201d</p>\n<p>Yuuri scrunches up his nose in disapproval, burrowing further into his pillow. He latches on tightly when Victor attempts to slide out of his grasp. \u201cNo.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI need to pee, Yuuri,\u201d Victor coos.</p>\n<p>Yuuri grumbles nonsensically in reply. The younger man scoots closer, crowding Victor\u2019s side of the bed and effectively pins Victor down with his limbs.</p>\n<p>\u201cTen more minutes,\u201d Yuuri mumbles around a yawn, going right back to sleep.</p>\n<p>And because he\u2019s weak for Yuuri and can\u2019t seem to say \u2018no\u2019 to anything Yuuri asks, Victor stays where he is.</p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t leave the bed for another ten minutes.</p>"
