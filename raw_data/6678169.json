  "text": "<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Fragrant strands of flowers sway above Sanji\u2019s head, various shades of purple and pink that create a soft petal sky overhead. The island they\u2019ve docked at this time is extraordinarily beautiful, endless fields of lush grass and delicate wildflowers, buildings webbed with blooming vines, air heady with nature\u2019s perfume. The market is beautiful as well, of course, and the food they have to offer is a pleasant change from the heavier fare the last couple of islands had to offer.</p>\n<p>There are delicate pastries, sweet jellies, various kinds of honeys and sauces and vinaigrettes. Sanji\u2019s fingers are already itching to try some of his own combinations and recipes. For now, he\u2019s just looking, mentally cataloguing the different shops so he can come back later and be as efficient and cost effective as possible, but he takes the time to stop into a small cafe, always eager to try what the locals have created with their years of experience with what their island has to offer.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s just finished his meal when he spots it, a rather rickety looking stall across the street and a few shops down. There\u2019s an elderly woman standing behind it with a pipe between her lips and an easy smile crinkling her face. Finishing his tea in a few careful swallows, he stands and heads out, leaving his money on the table and sauntering over to the stall that has caught his eye.</p>\n<p>The old woman smiles up at him, barely coming up to his ribs. \u201cHow can I help you, young man?\u201d Then she gets a better look at his face, where his gaze has fallen to the small jars at her elbow, and a knowing glint comes to her eyes. \u201cAh, you have a keen eye, don\u2019t you? Not many passing through here take the time to look so closely.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sanji returns her smile, \u201cI try my best to appreciate beauty, especially when it comes to food.\u201d</p>\n<p>The jars are a light coloured honey, comb submerged, with an assortment of tiny wildflowers pressed onto the lid. They\u2019re dainty and elegant, certainly something the ladies of the ship would appreciate.</p>\n<p>Then he notices the colorful bracelets hanging from the overarching sign, almost a mimicry of the petals overhead, pink and purple threads woven together.</p>\n<p>\u201cThose are a traditional craft here on the island,\u201d she explains, \u201cthey\u2019re meant to signify friendship, colors chosen by the one who gives it to depict the nature of their bond.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sanji\u2019s eyebrow lifts. <em>Friendship, eh?</em></p>\n<p>\u201cSo there are colors besides purple and pink?\u201d</p>\n<p>The woman\u2019s gaze becomes shrewd, eyes twinkling. \u201cWhat did you have in mind?\u201d</p>\n<p>-----</p>\n<p>[A few days earlier]</p>\n<p>\u201cOi, oi, what is that??\u201d</p>\n<p>A gull squawks overhead, followed by a burst of feathers and a triumphant cry from Luffy.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s the paper!\u201d</p>\n<p>Quick as a flash, half the crew is crowded around him, eager for the latest news and the possibility of updated wanted posters. Their voices all run together until Luffy\u2019s voice suddenly carries above the rest, \u201cEh? Zoro, Sanji, why are you in the paper?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat? Why do they get their own article?\u201d Usopp shouts, wrestling the paper from Luffy and looking for himself. \u201cWhat about the great Sogeking?\u201d</p>\n<p>Sanji exhales a stream of smoke and starts walking over, ignoring Usopp\u2019s continued clamoring and the subsequent battle for the paper. \u201cAn article?\u201d A thought suddenly hits him and a spark of hope flares in his eyes. \u201cIs there a picture?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMmmm,\u201d the paper rustles some more as the squabbling stops long enough to check. \u201cAh,\u201d Luffy yells. \u201cThere is, there is! Awesome, you guys look so cool! Hahahaha.\u201d</p>\n<p>A rubber arm bursts out of the small huddle and Sanji comes face to face with what is indeed a picture of him and Zoro, taken in the middle of their latest fight with a rowdy and brutish group of pirates. Sanji can already tell Zoro has that demonic look on his face, the way the photo is framed immediately drawing the eye to his crazed grin and shadowed face, single sword glinting as he finishes slicing through a swath of the other crew\u2019s men. Sanji is only a few paces away, in the middle of a spinning handstand, legs outstretched and...derriere in full view of the camera. Not even a glimpse of his face.</p>\n<p>\u201cFucking assholes,\u201d he grumbles, teeth clenching around his cigarette. \u201cDon\u2019t they know how to take a picture?\u201d Because really, how hard can it be to take one decent shot of him? Especially with the infamy surrounding their crew and how often Luffy got them mixed up in world affairs.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat is the article about, Luffy?\u201d Robin asks, voice soft and face impassive behind her sunglasses. But there\u2019s just enough of a faint smirk to her lips to have Sanji glancing warily at the swordsman still napping on the other side of the deck, apparently unbothered by all of the commotion. The stupid moss-head.</p>\n<p>\u201cInside the Strawhat Pirates: Roronoa Zoro and Blackleg Sanji,\u201d Chopper reads, which isn\u2019t too surprising considering the similar piece written on Luffy the previous month, so Sanji doesn\u2019t understand why the little reindeer\u2019s eyes go wide until he continues, \u201cA-A bond forged in hell.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBond?\u201d he repeats. \u201cWhat the hell does that mean?\u201d</p>\n<p>Usopp is laughing at Chopper\u2019s fretting while Luffy looks on in confusion. Franky thinks it\u2019s <em>super</em> but Sanji is far from convinced. After all, what kind of <em>bond </em>could people possibly think they have?</p>\n<p>\u201cApparently you and that idiot are the best of friends,\u201d Nami snickers, answering his unspoken question. She\u2019s managed to swipe the paper in the moment of confusion and flicks it once before reading out loud, \u201cBased on their ability to combine their individual fighting skills in the midst of the most heated battles, despite their ruthless and unyielding reputations, it must be that their relationship has surpassed that of crewmates. The feared Pirate Hunter Zoro and Black Leg Sanji have found a best friend in one another. After all, such an ease with one another can only come from a profound depth of understanding, truly a friendship forged in the firey pits of hell.\u201d</p>\n<p>A howl of laughter from Usopp only makes Nami\u2019s cat-like grin grow wider and Sanji can see that Zoro\u2019s eye has finally opened, surveying the scene with a carefully schooled expression.</p>\n<p>\u201cEh? Best friends?\u201d Luffy asks. \u201cThat\u2019s awesome! But nakama are <em>supposed </em>to be best friends.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNot all crews take being nakama in such a way,\u201d Robin explains. \u201cThe paper is simply highlighting the special connection between our dear cook and swordsman.\u201d</p>\n<p>And that, that is just too much for Sanji to handle.</p>\n<p>Whoever wrote the article obviously doesn\u2019t know what friendship looks like, or at least has never actually seen he and Zoro together, because anyone who\u2019s ever watched the strawhats for more than fifteen seconds knows Sanji and Zoro bicker like cats and dogs. Hell, they end up arguing and fighting with each other during battles as much as they fight their opponents.</p>\n<p>\u201cRobin-swan, not you too!\u201d he cries, twirling towards her and Nami and fixing them with his best puppy look. \u201cThe only special bond I have is with you lovely ladies~\u201d He hears a low snort and whips around to glare at the stupid marimo still nestled in place on the deck. \u201cGot something to say, moss-head?\u201d</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a beat of silence, a deep sigh, and then, \u201cAnnoying.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sanji\u2019s eyes glint. \u201cHah?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI said you\u2019re annoying,\u201d Zoro growls. \u201cYour ears as shitty as your cooking?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou-\u201d Sanji grits his teeth, stalking away from the rest of the crew to kick Zoro in his stupid, ugly mug, but gets the sword that comes up to block him instead, heel and blade colliding and pushing against one another. \u201cSay that again you shitty marimo.\u201d</p>\n<p>Zoro grunts at him, flinging his leg away with a quick slash and getting to his feet, sword still drawn and ready.</p>\n<p>Escalating from insults to blows to a brawl, they soon end up panting and staring at each other, swords and shoe locked together until Nami yells at them to shut up and stop disturbing everyone else. They step apart and head their separate ways, but not before Sanji hears Zoro mutter, \u201cAs if we could ever be friends.\u201d</p>\n<p>-----</p>\n<p>Over the following days as they had approach the island, Zoro continues to bristle any time someone brings up the joke. And the more Zoro bristles, the more Sanji pushes the issue. After all, he and Zoro always fight and push each other\u2019s buttons, and if he\u2019s found a new button to push it\u2019s not like he\u2019s going to pass up the opportunity.</p>\n<p>It certainly isn\u2019t his fault the marimo is taking the article the wrong way. Because really, he and Zoro? Best friends? Don\u2019t make him laugh. And the fact that some random reporter is the one who decided that they were somehow closer to each other than the rest of the crew, and was spreading that crap across the world, just made it more hilarious.</p>\n<p>So when he\u2019d heard the old lady\u2019s story and seen the inoffensive piece of jewelry he just couldn\u2019t help himself and had subsequently spent the next twenty minutes of his precious shopping time picking out and braiding strands of black and green threads.</p>\n<p>When he gets back to the ship, having recruited Franky to be his pack mule since the marimo was nowhere to be found, he can hardly suppress a mischievous smile as he sees Zoro slouched down at the foot of the foremast. The bracelet is safely bagged and tucked away in his breast pocket and it stays there as he unpacks and sorts through the new supplies, putting everything in their proper places and locking the fridge before strolling back out onto the deck. Zoro hasn\u2019t moved and Sanji is soon standing in front of him, throwing him into a shadow that has Zoro blinking and grunting up at him in displeasure.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat do you want, shit-cook?\u201d</p>\n<p>Sanji plucks the small bag from his pocket and tosses it towards Zoro\u2019s chest, keeping his face carefully neutral as Zoro inspects it. \u201cI got you a gift,\u201d he says, taking a drag of his cigarette to hide the smile tugging at his lips. \u201cIt\u2019s a friendship bracelet, apparently they\u2019re a tradition on the island.\u201d</p>\n<p>Now he doesn\u2019t bother hiding his grin, lets it curve smug and triumphant across his face. And Zoro\u2019s just staring at the thing, like he can\u2019t quite comprehend what he\u2019s holding.</p>\n<p>His moment of glory is cut short when Luffy suddenly crashes into the deck, nearly knocking Sanji off his feet with the force of the impact and throwing up a cloud of dust.</p>\n<p>\u201cSanji,\u201d he yells. \u201cI need meat! This place stinks, they keep trying to feed me flowers.\u201d</p>\n<p>As if on cue, Robin and Nami step back onto the deck, Nami\u2019s arms full of shopping bags. \u201cAre we having dinner soon, Sanji?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll be curious to see what you do with some of the local fare, cook-san.\u201d Robin walks past him with a few new books tucked under her arm and Sanji can\u2019t help but swoon.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll get started right away, Nami-chwan, Robin-swan~\u201d</p>\n<p>And just like that, the joke is over. Not as eventful as he\u2019d hoped it would be, but he got to see the blank look on that bastard\u2019s face at the very least. Most likely Zoro had already thrown the thing overboard, with a scoff and a glare and a silent vow to slice him in half.</p>\n<p>------</p>\n<p>Sanji\u2019s sure Zoro threw the thing overboard. He\u2019s sure of it.</p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t see the swordsman the rest of the night, their respective duties and sleeping schedules keeping them from really crossing paths, but the next morning they come face to face bright and early, Franky waking them all up because of a navy ship coming into the area faster than he\u2019d like.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s a flurry of activity, preparing the ship to sail on such short notice, Sanji and Chopper dashing into town to get a few last supplies as the others stay on board and try to keep their captain from going into attack mode. (Nami\u2019s recently made a rule that they can\u2019t just pick fights with anything that comes their way. They need to be more economical with their time, which often means physically restraining Luffy from flying off towards oncoming ships.)</p>\n<p>This particular morning they\u2019re only partially successful. They pull out of harbor and head out to sea but the ship has already spotted them and adjusted its course, gaining fast with the oncoming wind. They could use a coup de burst but Luffy is literally bouncing with energy so Nami sighs and acquiesces, telling him to at least finish up quickly. Unfortunately, Luffy\u2019s version of a quick and tidy victory is grabbing both Sanji and Zoro from their positions on deck and sending them all flying (and crashing) to the enemy ship.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d \u201cHoly-\u201d \u201cIs that-?\u201d \u201cStrawhat!\u201d</p>\n<p>A voice booms over the rest, \u201cStop them!\u201d</p>\n<p>And just like that the boat bursts to life around them, marines yelling and taking up arms, charging at them from all sides. Luffy is a blur of fists already and Sanji huffs out a breath, taking a long, relaxed drag of his cigarette and looking at the sky. Honestly, Luffy didn\u2019t even need to bring him or Zoro along, but he\u2019s not going to pass up the opportunity to blow off some steam, and apparently neither is Zoro, who\u2019s gripping the hilt of one sword with a familiar, bloodthirsty glint to his eye.</p>\n<p>A group of marines charge, Zoro slices through them, and in that instant Sanji feels his own eyes grow wide. Because there, on the arm now outstretched towards him, steel glinting in hand, is the stupid bracelet he\u2019d given Zoro. The bastard is actually wearing it.</p>\n<p>He doesn\u2019t have time to dwell on what that means before he\u2019s forced into action himself, delivering a sweeping kick to the marines who\u2019ve advanced his way. It\u2019s only one ship and it\u2019s not heavily armed, with no high ranking officers on board, so they finish up fairly quickly, back on their own deck in a new cloud of Luffy-induced dust in no time at all.</p>\n<p>And that bracelet is still on Zoro\u2019s wrist.</p>\n<p>And it stays there for the rest of the day and into the next, sitting tauntingly against tan skin and driving Sanji slowly mad. Because Zoro hasn\u2019t brought it up, hasn\u2019t used it to tease or goad him, has just been going about his normal business as if nothing\u2019s changed at all.</p>\n<p>Sanji\u2019s convinced it\u2019s some kind of scheme.</p>\n<p>Obviously, Zoro knew how eager Sanji had been to mess with him and had decided to turn the tables, and is now enjoying watching Sanji slowly suffer, dragging it out like the sick bastard he is. Sanji\u2019s close to snapping when they sit down for dinner, his eyes unconsciously flicking to the dark threads looped around Zoro\u2019s wrist.</p>\n<p>Then, as if his life couldn\u2019t get worse, Nami notices. Her eyebrows lift and she gives Zoro a curious look. \u201cAre you wearing a bracelet?\u201d</p>\n<p>Zoro hardly spares her a glance, just keeps eating what\u2019s in front of him and gives a guttural, \u201cAh,\u201d between swallows.</p>\n<p>Usually, Sanji would knock him upside the head for having such terrible manners towards a lady, but today he lets it go in the hopes that the conversation (limited though it may be) might offer some insight into the situation.</p>\n<p>Chopper leans over to get a closer look, \u201cIt\u2019s nice. Where\u2019d you get it?\u201d</p>\n<p>Sanji tenses at that, but Zoro just says, \u201cLast island,\u201d and takes a generous swallow of the drink at his side.</p>\n<p>And the conversation dies at that, no one finding the topic interesting enough to pursue, especially not when prying information out of Zoro might as well be labeled a feat of God. Dishes clink and clatter and Sanji\u2019s heart rate slowly returns to normal as the dinner winds to a close, nothing else out of the ordinary happening outside of Robin\u2019s mysterious smile as she leaves the kitchen.</p>\n<p>Except he\u2019s still confused, because Zoro had had the perfect opportunity to get him back and didn\u2019t do it. And it only gets worse as days pass and that bracelet continues to live on Zoro\u2019s left wrist. It becomes like his stupid bandana, always right there, somehow never getting sliced off in the middle of a fight.</p>\n<p>And Sanji...really doesn\u2019t know what to do with that.</p>\n<p>And he especially doesn\u2019t know what to do with the little spark of satisfaction he\u2019s started to get every time he sees it.</p>\n<p>-----</p>\n<p>Somehow, things start to change. It\u2019s so slow and subtle that the rest of the crew doesn\u2019t seem to notice, honestly Sanji probably wouldn\u2019t have realized it himself if he wasn\u2019t so weirded out by the whole thing. As it is, he\u2019s acutely aware of every incremental softening in the tension that\u2019s always existed between him and Zoro.</p>\n<p>They still argue, Sanji would be worried about the state of the world if they didn\u2019t, but it\u2019s not as intense, less of a fight and more of a way to test each other and get rid of excess energy. They share space. They get through entire dinners without glaring in the other\u2019s direction.</p>\n<p>One day, when Sanji feels the need to test what\u2019s going on between them, when he has to make sure that this all isn\u2019t some wild hallucination, he heads up to Zoro\u2019s training room in the crow\u2019s nest, a small box in one hand and a bottle of sake tucked under his arm. Zoro\u2019s attention is on him as soon as he emerges from the hatch-- it\u2019s not overt, Zoro\u2019s still counting his reps and looking resolutely at the wall, but Sanji can just <em>tell </em>the swordsman\u2019s watching him out of the corner of his eye<em>. </em>Finally, after Sanji\u2019s walked over to the bench and taken a seat, Zoro shifts his full attention Sanji\u2019s way.</p>\n<p>\u201cNeed something, ero-cook?\u201d</p>\n<p>Sanji takes his time lighting a cigarette, leaning over to crack a window when he sees Zoro\u2019s eyes narrow. \u201cA break from Luffy. He\u2019s been worse than usual, claims he\u2019s still making up for the lack of meat on that last island.\u201d He nudges the box in Zoro\u2019s direction and places the sake bottle beside it. \u201cI\u2019ll even reward you if you let me stay.\u201d</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a flash of worry that he\u2019s showing his hand a bit too much, but it\u2019s overtaken by the warm feeling that grows in his chest as his eyes flick down, catching on the dark band around Zoro\u2019s wrist before snapping back up to the swordsman's eye.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not a dog,\u201d Zoro grumbles, dropping his barbell carefully to the ground. \u201cAnd who says I\u2019d want your food as a reward anyway?\u201d</p>\n<p>A spark of anger flares up and Sanji opens his mouth to shoot something back, take his peace offering and shove it up Zoro\u2019s ass, but stops when Zoro suddenly sits down beside him, picking up the box and opening it carefully to inspect the onigiri nestled inside. Sanji forces himself to relax, lets a smug grin color his response, \u201cMy food is the best and you know it. Besides, I brought you booze. You never say no to booze.\u201d</p>\n<p>Zoro lets out a low, noncommittal hum, already working on demolishing the snack Sanji provided. The water is glistening in the late afternoon sun and Sanji allows himself to drift, smoke curling from between his lips as they sit in silence, not exactly comfortable but not bad either, something he feels like they could get used to with time.</p>\n<p>But thanks to their captain the tentative peace doesn\u2019t last for long, Sanji\u2019s hiding place discovered when he\u2019s halfway through his second cigarette, silence shattered when he\u2019s forced to lean out one of the windows and holler back at Luffy\u2019s whining, threatening all manner of bodily harm if the idiot dares go near his kitchen. Blowing out a thick cloud of smoke, he steps away from the window and towards the hatch, \u201cIt\u2019s close enough to when I usually start fixing dinner, might as well go guard the kitchen.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll bring these down when I\u2019m done,\u201d Zoro says, surprising Sanji with how easily he says it. Surprising him further when he actually does it, appearing in the galley doorway an hour later covered in a fresh sheen of sweat with the empty box and bottle in hand. What surprises Sanji most of all, however, is when Zoro sets them near the sink then turns to Sanji and asks, \u201cNeed any help?\u201d</p>\n<p>Normally, Sanji would say thanks but no thanks. Normally, Sanji would say like hell are you touching anything in my precious kitchen. Normally, Sanji wouldn\u2019t be in this predicament at all.</p>\n<p>He looks at Zoro thoughtfully for a moment then clears his throat, turning back to the sink to quickly wash Zoro\u2019s dishes as he says, \u201cYou could guard the door.\u201d</p>\n<p>He\u2019s aware it\u2019s not exactly what Zoro meant, but he can\u2019t help it (it <em>is </em>his precious kitchen after all). But Zoro doesn\u2019t seem to mind, just settles himself by the door and starts to doze, waking up to shout at their captain when he tries to break in a third time.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s convenient, enough so that when Zoro asks a second time Sanji says yes, again, and again, until days slip into weeks and Zoro\u2019s become a near fixture in his kitchen, napping by the door or doing small tasks beside him at the counter.</p>\n<p>They\u2019d started small, carrying supplies up from the storeroom, boiling water, grinding spices. Simple, safe.</p>\n<p>Then Sanji had armed him with a knife.</p>\n<p>He\u2019d seen the flash of a smile on Zoro\u2019s face as he sliced fruit for some afternoon smoothies and knew right then there was no going back, not when that stupid bracelet was still tied tightly around Zoro\u2019s wrist, soaking up sweat and strawberry juice and doing funny things to Sanji\u2019s heart.</p>\n<p>-----</p>\n<p>\u201cLuffy you idiot!\u201d Usopp yells. \u201cWhy would you attack marines for no reason?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThey were eating all the meat,\u201d Luffy whines back, ear caught between Nami\u2019s fingers as she drags him through the latest city\u2019s narrow alleys and backstreets with the rest of the crew in tow.</p>\n<p>Once they make it to a fairly safe distance Nami slows and knocks Luffy upside the head. \u201cNow we have to leave and you don\u2019t get any meat. And we can\u2019t get supplies.\u201d</p>\n<p>It\u2019s quiet for a moment, Luffy nursing the bump on his head while everyone else stands around to see what they\u2019re doing next, no one particularly concerned with the circumstances except Usopp and Nami. Luffy looks between the two of them then at the rest of the crew; his eyes lock on Zoro\u2019s a bit longer than the rest and then he\u2019s laughing, jumping to his feet with a hand on the back of his hat. \u201cI don\u2019t want to run. I want meat.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThey\u2019ve already seen us,\u201d Zoro shrugs. \u201cWe should just kill them and take their supplies.\u201d</p>\n<p>Nami sighs, \u201cYou two are impossible.\u201d</p>\n<p>And that\u2019s how they end up running around the city fighting marines, split up to cover the most ground with Nami, Sanji, and Chopper heading to the marine ship; Franky, Usopp, and Brook guarding Sunny; and Zoro, Robin, and Luffy left in the city to contain any of the marines who get in the way.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s also how they end up with as many stolen goods as the three of them can carry, meeting Franky at the Thousand Sunny so he can help lift them onto the deck, leaving Sanji free to head back into the city and collect Luffy and Zoro, since Robin had already made her way back to the ship, perfectly timed as always.</p>\n<p>Luffy is easy to find, with his loud voice and louder laughter, and he\u2019s easy to convince as well, springing back to the ship as soon as Sanji mentions the treasure map Nami had found, the promise of new adventure always too good for him to resist. Finding Zoro takes a bit more finesse, a certain skillset that Sanji has gotten better with over the years. And once he finds him, leading him back to the ship is a different skillset all together. It\u2019s gotten easier, though, as of late. Zoro fights him less, sticks closer. When he turns down a wrong side street, Sanji can reach out and tug him back, take another drag on his cigarette and let the sound of the ocean guide him back to Sunny.</p>\n<p>Getting the supplies had been laughably easy, and Sanji finds out why when he hears Luffy whining about Zoro stealing all the fun. Apparently he\u2019d come upon a large part of the unit and its leader trying to get in contact with headquarters and taken it upon himself to cut the conversation short. Which meant the rest of them were left alone while Zoro created his own personal bloodbath. Fighting with swords is always messy, it\u2019s why Sanji doesn\u2019t usually worry too much when he sees Zoro sticky with blood, it\u2019s why <em>Zoro </em>doesn\u2019t mind being covered with the stuff. Sanji\u2019s seem him clean his swords and eat his dinner and pass out on the deck still red and tacky from an afternoon\u2019s fight.</p>\n<p>In fact, Zoro\u2019s inclination towards personal hygiene is alarmingly low. Sanji likes to keep himself and his clothes fresh and clean, which means daily showers and regular sessions of doing laundry. It\u2019s a good week if Zoro\u2019s showered twice, a good month if he\u2019s done his laundry. (He\u2019ll rinse off in the ocean nearly every day, but Sanji doesn\u2019t consider that bathing. Or doing the laundry... no matter what Zoro insists otherwise.)</p>\n<p>So he\u2019s understandably surprised when he walks into the kitchen and sees Zoro standing at the sink, washing his hands and scrubbing at his arm with a determined look on his face. He\u2019s about to blow a gasket and punt the man out of his kitchen for washing his grimy self off in the kitchen sink instead of the bathroom but stops when he notices what <em>exactly </em>Zoro is washing. Or trying to wash, would probably be the more accurate description. And it\u2019s that damn bracelet.</p>\n<p>Stepping up beside the other man, Sanji bumps him carefully, shoulder to shoulder for just a moment. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, marimo?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNothing,\u201d he says, still scrubbing and not looking up.</p>\n<p>Sanji considers his options, eyes the knife block just an arm\u2019s length away and prays he\u2019s read the situation right. Carefully, with as much nonchalance as he can muster, he reaches out and wraps his fingers around Zoro\u2019s arm, pulling it towards him and tracing over the wet threads with his thumb. Some of the green is slightly stained, a bit darker than the rest, and Sanji spares a moment to wonder if one day the entire bracelet will be black. But for now it\u2019s not what Zoro wants, so he releases Zoro\u2019s arm, holds out his hand instead.</p>\n<p>\u201cGive it here, I\u2019ll clean it for you.\u201d</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a beat of silence, Zoro leveling a piercing stare at Sanji before he finally looks down, unties the bracelet with careful fingers before dropping it into Sanji\u2019s waiting palm. There\u2019s a strip of paler skin in a band around Zoro\u2019s wrist and Sanji has to stop himself from reaching out to touch it, to feel warm skin and know that somehow he had a part in creating the mark beneath his fingers.</p>\n<p>Cold water, a dash of salt, and a fair amount of elbow grease later the bracelet is nearly back to its original colors. He rinses it one last time then shuts off the sink, takes a steadying breath in the sudden silence and runs the pad of his thumb over the knots in the threads. Zoro\u2019s still waiting by the sink, one eye watching Sanji carefully as he lifts his arm, palm down, an invitation that Sanji finds himself unable to resist as he carefully loops the band around Zoro\u2019s wrist and ties it back into place, letting his fingers linger slightly longer than necessary, tips sliding along the space between skin and thread before he steps back and digs in his pocket for a cigarette.</p>\n<p>Something sparks in his chest, something warm and entirely too familiar. He glances up at Zoro, breathing in a lungful of smoke and sighing it out again.</p>\n<p>He might just be well and truly fucked.</p>\n<p>-----</p>\n<p>It\u2019s a slow afternoon on the Sunny, another in a recent line of uneventful days. Franky and Usopp are in their workshops, the ladies are relaxing on deck, and Brook is amusing Luffy and Chopper with a new piece he\u2019d created the night before. Taking a last look out at the horizon and deciding they aren\u2019t in any imminent danger, Sanji heads for the crow\u2019s nest, grabbing a glass of water and his recipe book from the kitchen on his way.</p>\n<p>The space is filled with afternoon sun, glinting off the metal of the weights as Zoro lifts them again and again, the curve of his muscle bunching with each repetition, thick vein standing out along the side. Sanji sets the water down.</p>\n<p>A window is already propped open to let in the cooling sea breeze and Sanji leans against the sill, lights up a cigarette and lets smoke curl out into open air while Zoro continues his counting, voice quieter now that Sanji\u2019s there. They tend to spend their time together in a comfortable silence more often than not, (at least until one of them gets bored and picks a fight). But the laziness that\u2019s fallen over the ship is infectious and neither of them move to break the calm, sharing space as if they\u2019ve been doing it all their lives instead of just a few careful months.</p>\n<p>When his third cigarette burns down to nothing, he snuffs it out in an ashtray he\u2019s taken to keeping just beside the window-- his window-- the one he now finds open when he comes up to fetch Zoro for a meal or help in the kitchen, or simply to escape. The sun is sinking lower but there\u2019s still a couple hours until he needs to start fixing dinner, so he settles down on a bench instead, recipe book open in his lap and glass of water now half empty by his side, Brook\u2019s newest song drifting in through the window.</p>\n<p>Time passes peacefully and far too quickly. In what seems like the blink of an eye, Sanji knows it\u2019s time for him to get up and get started in the kitchen. He loves his work, that still hasn\u2019t changed, but he\u2019s come to savor these quiet moments nearly as much as the food he makes.</p>\n<p>\u201cOi, dartbrow,\u201d Zoro calls, the sun lower and clouds drifting in, weight held deceptively still against his shoulder as Sanji looks back at him from the hatch. \u201cI\u2019ll be down later. After this set.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sanji smirks, eyes the ridiculously large piece of metal and taps the recipe book against his own shoulder. \u201cDon\u2019t strain yourself, marimo. Wouldn\u2019t want to lose my pack mule.\u201d</p>\n<p>Zoro scoffs at that and adjusts the weight in his hands just to show off, swings it in Sanji\u2019s direction so he has to duck quickly down the hatch with a last shouted curse at the swordsman\u2019s thick head.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s halfway through preparations when Zoro finally walks into the galley, knocking once on the doorframe to draw Sanji\u2019s attention. \u201cNami needed me to adjust one of the sails,\u201d he says in way of explanation, \u201cShe says we\u2019re close to another island and wants to steer clear of it to save time, so if Luffy asks don\u2019t say anything.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNot big enough to be worth stopping?\u201d</p>\n<p>Zoro shrugs and leans against the table, \u201cShe doesn\u2019t seem to think so.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThen I\u2019m sure it\u2019s not,\u201d he quips, always ready and willing to support his crewmates of the more delicate persuasion.</p>\n<p>Zoro grunts dismissively and grabs a knife from its holder, getting to work preparing the apples and strawberries for dessert. There\u2019s not much left that he can help with this far along in the process, not much left to do at all but keep an eye on things as they cook until it\u2019s time to put them all together, so Sanji takes the opportunity to watch Zoro work.</p>\n<p>His brow is furrowed in concentration and there\u2019s a squint to his eye that says he\u2019s trying to follow Sanji\u2019s advice, cutting things just so in order to get the most out of the produce. He\u2019s not wearing a shirt, so Sanji can easily see the movement of his muscles as he works, from the nimble work of his fingers to the shifting of his back. Sweat darkens the hair at his temples and the nape of his neck, running in small beads down his back before disappearing into the thick cloth of his haramaki.</p>\n<p>Sanji swallows and forces himself not to look away-- he knows it\u2019s time to take the feeling in his chest and confront it, to stop trying to ignore what\u2019s staring him in the face.</p>\n<p>Zoro\u2019s not soft, he\u2019s not pale and curvy like the women Sanji favors, but he\u2019s still attractive in his own way. He\u2019s someone Sanji trusts, can be comfortable with. He\u2019s someone Sanji respects.</p>\n<p>Then, Zoro lifts his arm and wipes at his face, he\u2019s smart enough to keep his hand out of the way but Sanji still bristles, kicking the other man in the hip so he nearly loses his balance, catching himself on the edge of the sink.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat the hell, shit-cook? What was that for?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFor being an idiot in my kitchen!\u201d Sanji snarks back. \u201cNext time, shower before you come, or at least make sure you\u2019re not going to be dripping all over the food. You\u2019re throwing off the salt content.\u201d</p>\n<p>Zoro grumbles under his breath but acquiesces, washing his hands and forearms in the sink before throwing Sanji a look, smirking in a way Sanji definitely doesn\u2019t like right before he dunks his head under the stream as well.</p>\n<p>\u201cIdiot! What the fuck are you doing?\u201d</p>\n<p>Laughing, Zoro rights himself, squinting through the water dripping down his face to smile in Sanji\u2019s direction.</p>\n<p>All of the fight leaves Sanji in a whoosh, leaving him standing there feeling like he\u2019s been punched in the chest. Zoro looks...he actually looks <em>cute </em>and Sanji is one hundred percent not ready to handle that. So he throws a dishtowel at the bastard\u2019s face instead, effectively shielding himself from the deadly combination of Zoro dripping wet and <em>smiling </em>in Sanji\u2019s direction, that stupid bracelet taunting him as Zoro ruffles the towel through his hair.</p>\n<p>Sanji doesn\u2019t know whether he wants to kick him out or...do something else entirely.</p>\n<p>Thankfully a timer goes off and he\u2019s able to shift his attention elsewhere, working at juggling all the pots and pans coming off the stove and resolutely not looking in Zoro\u2019s direction. It works well enough, lasting him until he calls the rest of the crew for dinner and the galley explodes into a whirlwind of food and noise and conversation. Seeing everyone happy and well-fed around him takes most of the edge off, leaving him much more relaxed when dinner winds down and he\u2019s once again skirting around Zoro in close quarters, picking up dishes with Robin\u2019s help.</p>\n<p>Then they\u2019re alone, Robin excusing herself to her books while Sanji and Zoro wash and dry, both lost in their own thoughts as the sun sets and night folds in around them.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s dark outside when the kitchen is back in order, gauzy clouds masking most of the moonlight and painting the Sunny with blotchy shadows. Sanji leans out over the rail, obscures his own piece of the horizon as he blows smoke from between his lips. Waves lap gently at the ship, the sound as lulling as the gentle rocking they produce, and before long Sanji hears a yawn from below his elbow where Zoro\u2019s propped himself up at Sanji\u2019s side. The night is quiet, the stars muted, and the rest of the crew has already turned in for the night, so Sanji allows himself a gentle smile before he looks back out over the sea.</p>\n<p>When his cigarette is nothing but forgotten ashes, ember long burnt out in the water below, he feels a soft weight against the side of his thigh and freezes for just a moment before he looks down and sees a familiar shock of mossy green.</p>\n<p>\u201cOi, I\u2019m not a pillow,\u201d he says, but makes no move to extract his leg.</p>\n<p>Zoro snores softly in response.</p>\n<p>The ship moves forward and the stars move with it and Sanji can\u2019t stop the warm feeling blooming in his chest, filling his whole body with a tingling weightlessness that makes the night seem somehow longer, stretched out and sweet like taffy. It\u2019s not until a cool breeze pushes past the buttons of his shirt that he stirs, pushes himself up from the rail and glances back down at Zoro\u2019s sleeping form.</p>\n<p>\u201cIdiot,\u201d he murmurs, sounding far too fond for his liking. He runs his hand over soft green hair, surprised at the softness he finds before he threads his fingers through the strands, catching and tugging ever so slightly until Zoro grunts and shifts against the deck. \u201cOi, sleep in a real bed, shitty marimo.\u201d</p>\n<p>Zoro rumbles a response, something too low and garbled for Sanji to actually understand, but he holds out his hand, keeps it there until Sanji huffs, grabs it and pulls him to his feet. He rubs at his eye for a moment but still doesn\u2019t let go, their fingers loosely tangled as he follows Sanji\u2019s silent path to the bunks. (Sanji pretends it\u2019s so Zoro doesn\u2019t get lost, tries to ignore the soft look on Zoro\u2019s face and the half-asleep trust he\u2019s put in Sanji\u2019s hands.)</p>\n<p>It\u2019s dark downstairs but Sanji\u2019s eyes can still pick out Zoro\u2019s shape as they part and head to their respective beds. He can see the way Zoro settles down, right hand touching his left wrist in an unconscious confirmation before sighing and drifting off to sleep.</p>\n<p>Lying in his own bed, Sanji stares up at the ceiling, imagining the stars above and trying to ignore the lingering warmth against his fingers.</p>\n<p>-----</p>\n<p>Time passes, weeks go by, new islands come and go, and the strawhats are still getting themselves into all kinds of trouble. No matter where they are, the sleepiest of city\u2019s or the loneliest of seas, adventure always finds them and Luffy sends them crashing into it at breakneck speeds. Not that the rest of them are guiltless, just as eager for new challenges as their captain, ready to take on the world.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou ready, shitty marimo?\u201d</p>\n<p>Zoro smirks around his sword, \u201cTry to keep up, ero-cook.\u201d</p>\n<p>The air reverberates with the sound of thousands of voices come together in a single shout, countless marines charging at them with guns and swords held ready. An explosion rocks the ground as Luffy battles a captain not too far off in the distance and Sanji can see the rest of their crew fighting on the wings. But the majority of the fighting, that\u2019s always left for him and Zoro. Luffy gets the big guns, the top dogs, but it\u2019s he and Zoro who are left to take care of the rest, to look after the crew, to face whatever comes their way and have faith in their captain. They\u2019re two parts of the monster trio and they take pride in that. And they\u2019ve always been good at their job.</p>\n<p>But now, fighting together, it\u2019s even better than before. It\u2019s like they\u2019re seamless, moving together across dusty cobblestones as a single force, linked by an invisible thread as they raze the men around them to the ground. Separating and coming back together, brushing shoulders and exchanging insults and wisecracks along the way; the entire thing is over in a flash, the air cloudy and the ground wet with blood.</p>\n<p>Neither he nor Zoro have a scratch.</p>\n<p>The energy crackling between them is nearly palpable, adrenaline singing in their veins as the fight ends and the high lingers. Their eyes lock and Zoro smirks, Wado going back between his teeth.</p>\n<p>Sanji huffs a laugh and can\u2019t keep the smile off his face as he jumps, throwing a kick at Zoro\u2019s chest that would send a lesser man flying. They go back and forth, shouting and kicking up dust, until they hear Nami shout from the edge of the destruction.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t the time for that, you idiots! Get back to the ship!\u201d</p>\n<p>Sanji pulls back with a cheerful cry of, \u201cOf course, Nami-chwan~\u201d and Zoro sheaths his swords, falling in step beside Sanji as they make their way back. Their shoulders bump and Sanji can see the hint of a smile beneath Zoro\u2019s cool exterior, can still remember it in his head as they\u2019d fought, wild and free and full of slightly crazed laughter. He\u2019s gone and fallen for an idiot but he can\u2019t help himself, can\u2019t help that he\u2019d do anything to keep that smile alive.</p>\n<p>Chopper squeaks and runs around them as soon as they set foot on deck, jumping all over them to make sure they aren\u2019t hurt.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re fine,\u201d Zoro says, catching the little reindeer in the crook of one arm. \u201cThose marines were useless.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t lie!\u201d Chopper cries, struggling in Zoro\u2019s hold to look him over more thoroughly. \u201cYou only look this happy after a challenge.\u201d</p>\n<p>Zoro\u2019s eyes widen slightly at that and Sanji hides a chuckle in his sleeve, lighting a cigarette to give himself something to do while Zoro stammers and tries to yell out excuses. Finally, Sanji knocks him in the back of the head then leans down to look Chopper in the eye. \u201cThere was a challenge, but it wasn\u2019t the marines. We\u2019re both fine.\u201d</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a beat of silence then Chopper\u2019s yelling again, \u201cYou- Why were you fighting each other?? I\u2019ve told you not to take it too far!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLook closer, doctor-san,\u201d Robin says, appearing out of nowhere to smile knowingly in their direction. \u201cI think you\u2019ll find they\u2019re both in better condition than usual.\u201d</p>\n<p>For some reason, Sanji finds himself blushing and excuses himself to the railing to smoke in peace, letting Chopper fuss over him for a few minutes before the doctor is truly convinced that they\u2019re both unharmed.</p>\n<p>\u201cChopper those idiots are fine,\u201d Nami says, leaning over the upper deck to glare at Sanji and Zoro. \u201cGet your asses in gear and let\u2019s get out of here! It\u2019s your fault we\u2019re late!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOi, what the hell\u2019s that supposed to mean?\u201d Zoro glares back.</p>\n<p>Sanji moves back into Zoro\u2019s space. \u201cIt means shut up and get to work, stupid marimo. Didn\u2019t you hear the beautiful lady?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou shut up, dartbrow!\u201d</p>\n<p>Swords come out and shoes fly but they don\u2019t get very far before they\u2019re sent crashing to the ground.</p>\n<p>\u201cBoth of you!\u201d Nami lands twin punches to each of their heads. \u201cStop fighting and do your jobs!\u201d</p>\n<p>They both stand, grumbling and glaring at one another, and walk off to get ready to sail, preparing to flee from whatever reinforcements the marines are sending their way.</p>\n<p>Hours later, out of dodge and out from under Nami\u2019s thumb, they come right back together, Sanji looking out to sea with Zoro dozing at his side.</p>\n<p>-----</p>\n<p>They\u2019ve fallen into a familiar routine by the time they reach the next island. They tease and spar and terrorize each other. They share space and quiet moments and the adrenaline of a good fight. The crew\u2019s finally become privy to the change as well, recognizing the lack of real malice between their words and the way they\u2019ve come to gravitate towards one another.</p>\n<p>To Sanji\u2019s embarrassment, most of the reactions range from thinking it\u2019s adorable to deeming it hilarious. But all in all he can\u2019t complain, the crew\u2019s happy that they\u2019re happy and it doesn\u2019t get better than that.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s brought Zoro along to the market, ostensibly to serve as pack mule but he\u2019s not bought anything yet, still in the stage of surveying all of the options. But when he turns to make a comment on the outrageous price of kiwis he finds that he\u2019s alone. Heaving a sigh and running a hand through his hair, all Sanji can do is resign himself to his fate. That idiot got lost all the time, he\u2019d find his way back eventually or Sanji would find him. There was no sense worrying about it now.</p>\n<p>And true to form, about an hour later Zoro wanders up to the stall he\u2019s at, complaining about the streets moving and Sanji wandering off and everything looking the same. Sanji insults his sense of direction and piles his arms with supplies and doesn\u2019t question it until later that night, when Zoro\u2019s putting away the last of the dishes and clears his throat.</p>\n<p>\u201cI got you something,\u201d he says, fishing in his haramaki and dropping a small, gauzy bag into Sanji\u2019s hand.</p>\n<p>He pulls the drawstring and a thin bracelet falls into his palm, black leather with a golden clasp. \u201cThis-\u201d he starts, then stops, not quite sure what to say. His eyes flick to the bracelet on Zoro\u2019s own wrist then up to meet his eye, gaze filled with challenge. But now Sanji can also see the tiny hint of uncertainty behind it, not in himself because Zoro doesn\u2019t do things in halves, but in Sanji\u2019s response.</p>\n<p>Now, Sanji can see the slight widening of his eye when Sanji\u2019s gaze drifts down to Zoro\u2019s lips, exhales a cloud of smoke, sharp and sweet before snuffing out his cigarette and pulling Zoro close, mouths coming together sharp and sure.</p>\n<p>Now, Sanji can smell the salt on Zoro\u2019s skin and taste the sake on Zoro\u2019s lips as he deepens the kiss. He licks and bites at Zoro\u2019s bottom lip and revels in the soft groan it gets him, can hear the relief and the want and the trust in just that small sound. Their foreheads meet and their eyes lock and Sanji reaches down to trace the worn and faded threads that started it all, kisses away Zoro\u2019s slight intake of breath.</p>\n<p>He pulls back just enough to let Zoro fasten the thin leather around his wrist, clasp a glint of light against pale skin.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>He never takes it off.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>"
